@lpsrocks They won't Kochs have them cornered!
Better yet? Immediately change political affiliations to independent & ALL of you vote for #MedicareForAll.
I'm all for #MedicareForAll but read Bernie's plan and have some reservations about it. It needs some work.
Has he released it yet? I just received an email from Sanders requesting our ideas. Conyers has released his House version though (HR676)
not sure, I read Conyers and whats on Bernie's website. I'm very interested, from my calculations it shouldnt cost more than what we pay now
Still waiting for you to propose something to improve healthcare after all these years.
#MedicareForAll please Senator!
It is not the responsibility of government to force anyone to purchase anything. Just get rid of the mandates.
But from auto insurance and property insurance on mortgaged homes qto seat belts...
 #MedicareForAll
What is it going to take to get it through your thick heads...WE DONT WANT OBAMACARE!!!
They COULD but that would require them to re-acknowledgethat uppity black man who didn’t know his place. More important than constituents.
After 7 years of pleas and begging! The most insincere comment ever! Spare me your false concerns..only illegals and a few Americans matter
Working together is the right way to do things. Don't be pressured by those who live in a hate driven environment to budge towards racism.
Freedom and choice have nothing to do with racism
No way should a bill be voted on that hasn't been rev'd by CBO. Why are they trying to sneak it through in the darkness of night???
Because it wouldn't survive the light of day.
Tacoma checking in here Medicare for all plz thx Patty!
They could,  but they won't.
Yes, they can. If just 3 of them remember that they are elected to help people, not line lobbyists pockets.
DEMOCRACY RULES
Whats trump care is he actually writing the bill?
But they won't...they'd have done it and that's why GOP loses 2018 midterms, WH 2020...and GOP finally dies for good from US POLITICS
I hope they don't.
Why lie calling it Trumpcare. YOU GOT US HERE NOW DO SOMETHING TO FIX THE DAMN THING OR GO HOME
Trumpdoesn'tcare
Just like you did with ACA in 2010. Gotcha.
Ha ha. You made a funny.
If they do, they'll all be out of a job.Just like we did to the Democrats.They were elected to #RepealObamacare and better keep the promise!
I wish.
Hope 3 @GOP have enough courage to tell Turtle Man to bugger himself.
And monkeys could also fly out of my butt singing "Onward Christian Soldiers." In fact, that happening is more likely.
Does SenGOP enjoy making decisions2hurt people as the driving force behind their votes? Maybe they feel safe & not worry abt their HC or job

As GOP made clear today, they would rather vote for a bill they hate than work with Dems.
Stay strong!!!
Some would rather die. (Fully covered of course.)
it isn't trump care he isn't a senator  you are useless
Thanks Ms Murray for working so hard for all of us. I hope you don't mind I have a martini a night with your name on it....in spirit..  :)
exactly. They should as they don't have the capacity to develop a good plan.
like you did with Obama care no thanks lady, you can go on your recess
Why is ObamaCare only for Legislators?! They voted to keep it for themselves but we can't have it. #NoTrumpCare #NoConfidence
Don't bet on it.
THEIR FATE AS THESE PIGS MAKE UP A HEALTCARE BILL OVER LUNCH. @SenateGOP YOU WILL HAVE HELL TO PAY IF YOU PASS THIS!
Yes, they can!
@NerdyTraveler They are the party of the 1% and don't give a damn about the American people. You can't reason with them.
@SenateMajLdr @SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC ONLY GIVE A SHIT ABOUT THEMSELVES. CLD CARE LESS FAMILIES AWAKE SCARED SHITLESS AS THEY AWAIT
Afraid that's too rational for these #PartyOverNation idiots. Unprecedented betrayal of what most Americans want. @SenateDems
YES! I have been calling tweeting emailing since the beginning saying the same thing! FIX WHAT EXISTS! Rep/Rep is 100% EGO based!

You have been awesome. Thank you!
You CANNOT improve Obamacare. You got to erase it from the board then began talks to do healthcare right!
There is no improving ACA. Head straight to #MedicaidForAll. Do not pass Go. Do not collect #BigPharma nor #MedicalInsurance lobbyist $.
ah but that's not their plan their plan is to destroy American lives for their own twisted agenda
...or Democrats can admit they screwed the pooch and lied to millions of Americans about #Obamacare

Or... Democrats can give up on socialized medicine and join average day Americans who want a free market for health care
Free market healthcare does't make sense man. It's not a commodity that you can checkout of a store, or a service that you can simply DIY.
Free markets are based on choice, and when you need urgent healthcare you have no choice. AND you can't add coverage after a new diagnosis.
Medicare for All is inevitable, work towards that.  

After that we need Social Security for All.
If you would get a job you would get Soc. Sec. When u retire!
Please push them to do this. They have Trump fever or something. @SenateGOP do you really want to hurt sick Americans & make ins expensive?
Pls reach out directly to @SenatorCollins @SenCapito @lisamurkowski & other GOP women to craft a solution. #WomenWillLead #SaveOurCare
Thank you for fighting for your constituents and all Americans!
They won't.
— Doesn't sound like this is what's happening at all, we need you to defend our health care instead of promises of a future beautiful policy
And hell can also still freeze over?
Please go across the aisle and get in @LindseyGrahamSC face. Tell him SC is mad as hell over the report he is going to vote YES.
I suggest the republicans vote for the bill and I voted for Patty Murray.  The Democratic Party did this same move I also voted for Patty
well yes...they could do this...which would make perfect sense...but will they??
That's hilarious. They don't care enough to do anything remotely close to that.
