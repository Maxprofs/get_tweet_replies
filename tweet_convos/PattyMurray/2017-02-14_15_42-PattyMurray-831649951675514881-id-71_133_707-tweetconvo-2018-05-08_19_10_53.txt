We need an immediate & independent investigation into Russian interference in our elections & potential links btwn Kremlin & Trump campaign.
President Trump has remained far too dismissive of Russiaâ€™s hostile behavior and Americans deserve to know why that is.
We cannot afford a WH that accommodates Putin & his meddling in foreign elections, aggression in Ukraine, & record of human rights abuses.
@djbratpack TOO LATE!!
.@PattyMurray if by "events" you mean the leaks and the political assassination of this man, then by all means I agree, but you don't.
.@click4mrh @PattyMurray Don't confuse whistle blowing with leaks. Guilty is guilty.
.@tobyt8 @PattyMurray subversion is what it is, regardless of how you wish to define it. Data collection on Americans is wrong.
Not when you're a General and communicating with Russian diplomats.
.@tobyt8 @PattyMurray that doesn't exonerate or condemn Flynn's actions.
Get mad. Time to move now. People want a thorough and complete independent investigation now.
This has gone way beyond Flynn. Dig in and find the truth.
Be "deeply troubled" all you want but start standing up for an independent investigation of the Russian hacking and contacts.
Have you not been paying attention? This surprises you?
Why is it that the Republican leadership in the House and Senate is refusing to investigate, placing Politics before Country?
Crickets on Obamas past "flexability" whisperings to Russian Ambassador on hot mic in 2012 #Hypocrite #RedHerring #DishonestDNC
I agree!
Oh...we should be WAY more then troubled! I expect our Dem's to start biting their ass like a rabid guard dog to investigate!!
Investigate!
