There are moments in history we look back on & wonder why more didn’t stand up & fight. Let’s make sure this moment is written differently.
I want you to know I’m in touch w/ officials across local, state, & federal government—I’m going to keep fighting back as hard as I can. -PM
I really fear for the state of the country today.
Delay vote on Tillerson. Demand he return to answer ?'s RE: #NoBanNoWall #BanBannonNSC & Gaz 19% sale
@SenateDems Block #Sessions
where were you? Drop the mouse and pick up a bullhorn or give someone else the job.
keep up the fight!  Thank you so much for opposing the ban on immigration....this is what we are all about!
This ban doesn't protect anyone.
I applaud Trump! Everyone wants to be safe, and yet complain about Trump' sexecutive order to do so.
If Trump is so bad on immigration & borders, then watch the video about Bill Clinton's address to Congress in 1995.
@SenateDems Make up your minds! Are you for THE PEOPLE or only 4 political gain by using circumstances 2 get noticed? #DemExit
thankyou for standing up against this unconstitutional immoral order. Please do more. No olive branches. We are counting on you
burn the motherfuckers in the GOP down, pretty please.
oh noes! Mean people!

Keep'em coming, better to mess with me than someone who cares, dipshit.
Beautifully said. Thank you so much for fighting for good all these years,, and especially now.
thank you!!!
@parisjKOMO sorry but, go back to 1952 about public law 141

Do you understand why?
This is not #fakenews 
Protect America 
@POTUS

@SenateDems keep the rats out of our country.
@RepRickLarsen Thank you both, we are counting on you.

@SenateDems

please  help us get our country from this man who is a liar and hates,
time to retire your old worn decrepit tennis shoes.
senator, words are not enough. We need action you & our others members of Congress. If we don't get it we will elect new reps.
Actions have consequences. Restricted travel in/out is the new norm.  Pink triangle, my required emblem. Weep.
This is a terrifying time in our history. Trump is insane and WHY is Bannon involved with anything? #insane
You know darn well this is a hold, and NOT a ban! Stop whipping up hysteria on the left. People would like to use the airports!
@SenateDems liberal hate is real
@SenateDems Violating constitution,  Fed laws, Geneva Convention = Impeach Trump and Pence
but this could never happen here, right? Let's just let folks in because that's who we are?
I do not thank you for the chaos you've created! We need protection in our lands just as much as any who need protecting!
great. What. Are. You. Doing. About. It?
thank you for taking a stand on this!
@SenateDems Thank you for fighting for the American way of freedom and inclusiveness. #rejecthate

Thank you! On Monday BLOCK ALL TRUMP cabinet confirmations until this matter is settled. OBSTRUCT! DENY! FIGHT Bannon/Trump!
@RepRickLarsen thank you for speaking truth to power  thank you for standing up for compassion!
@SenateDems There are millions of people who support this, common sense,  order. Our voices will be heard in 2018.
There are more of us than there are of you. Trump Lost by 3 million votes.
Like the ancestors of ANYONE WHO IS WHITE IN AMERICA
so glad my g-gparents immigrated during WWI to flee war and impoverished Eastern Europe and Ireland. they came to escape WAR & POVERTY
@SenateDems Start voting obstructionist.
I'm disappointed you are not telling the entire story-other Pres have done same-Pres has right to close borders-you're twisting
please fight for us! You're resistance keeps me from a full on panic attack. Whatever you need
Everyday you embarrassed the state of W.A. do you really support letting terrorist in?
We need you now like never before
TY Dems need to speak out w a united voice. We need leadership now. Need a Dem to be on TV constantly fighting Trump.

Can you tell us how the senators are going to fight this unconstitutional ban?
pls confirm: are detainees in a Tacoma Detention center or have the remaining 11 been deported? #MuslimBan #seatacprotest
First step is to fight against idiotic foreign policies (such as Obama supported in Libiya and Syria) that create refugees.
Read & watch video
obama did a freeze, other presidents did various too.just last yr gov sd we haven't been vetting good enough.
thank you for speaking up. what can/will you personally do to help us combat this?
Start using the word IMPEACHMENT now!
And thank you for supporting the terrorist who are trying to shut down seatac.
