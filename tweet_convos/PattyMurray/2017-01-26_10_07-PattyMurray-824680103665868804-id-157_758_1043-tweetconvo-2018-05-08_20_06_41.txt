Thank you Senator Murray. Is Senator Lieberman trying to SOS back there?
Dont hire her or any of trump picks
Good. Public schools are way overdue for reform.
.@sagecommander @pattymurray #BetsyDeVos didn't reform public schools in Michigan. She wrecked them. https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&biw=&bih=&q=betsy+devos+michigan+public+schools&gbv=2&oq=betsy+devos+mich&gs_l=heirloom-hp.1.3.0i131j0l5.1922.8922.0.13235.18.13.0.1.1.0.469.4829.2-1j6j6.13.0....0...1ac.1.34.heirloom-hp..4.14.5017.WUMj9g5xntQ …
If you claim that one single person could "wreck" an entire state's schools, then they were weak to begin with.
@PoliticalAnt @PattyMurray
A single person ...wielding millions of dollar bills.
If "A single person ...wielding millions of dollar bills" is bad, then a bureaucracy doing it with billions is worse.
Changing the subject doesn't change the facts.
SHE IS TRYING TO PREVENT FUTURE IDIOTS LIKE U BECOMING SENATORS
Good job!
is the dumbest person in Congress. #BigPharmaPuppet
@SenSchumer Good. How many decades of increase after increase only to get worse results? Patty certainly loves her NEA $$
@bfm4440 Just another way to segregate schools and cover it up.
UNQUALIFIED. UNFIT
she isn't qualified to head up a preschool let alone our education for the country.
nationwide our public schools are failing and getting worse.  For many parents private ed is the only hope for their children.
This was a "change" election.  If you reject change, voters will remember.  School choice for the rich exists, not for poor.
Up yours Betsy!
Senator Murray defends failing public schools who keep kids in inner cities from getting a great education. How sad. Just another clown.
@snohotom This is great news. I'm an #educator and we can use a fresh approach. We teach Ss to consider all sides of issues.
Devos is unusually unqualified. No debate. Republican senators must speak up against the destruction of US public schools
@Michele_Wyatt66 #StopDeVos #DenyDeVos
please vote NO!
are you going to vote no on DeVos?
@SenSchumer and your point is??
Is she advocating Federalization of LOCAL school boards and Boards of Education? STOOPID!
@SenSchumer Good for Ms.DeVos! Thank you! My kids deserve an ed as good as Murray's & Schumer's. School vouchers for me please!
Support Betsy Devos, the failed American education system's last chance and our children's best future hope.
@BonnieLR_Writes @BetsyDeVos is totally unqualified to be in charge of our education system. As a teacher I demand a no vote.
Please vote no
She's not qualified! We can't hope to educate our children with the likes of her at the helm of education.
@SenSchumer Save our children from this travesty
don't give in. Just say no
Vote NO DeVos. Can you convince your GOP friends to join you?
do NOT appoint DeVos for secretary of education.
Privatizing public schools sounds like a good idea to I. Get government out of it. That is if you want it to succeed.
which means the responsibility for a kid's future is in their parents' pocketbook. Serfs up, guys!
First of all you need to relax. So apparently you think the education system we now have is adequate.
DeVos refused to rule out choice in education and cutting out wasteful spending.  DeVos is exactly who we need!
providing schools is dangerous. Patents will be complete responsible for their kids futures via wealth margins.
That's "parents" not "patents", fella.
what of families who can't afford good quality education? They get shafted. The rich kids will get the best ed.
Poor and working class kids are getting shafted now.
they will only give you the choice of which corporation the but education for your kid from.
Did you ever here of competition?  You don't seem to be familiar w/ free enterprise.
competition? With how many mega corps? It'll go the way of insurance. A few big players choking the market.
@mhutchings52 #NeverDevos
This woman is not qualified.
that's wondeful!
Please flush the toilet on this woman and let's move on to a real nominee who lives in the real world. #DumpDevos
Has she divested herself of her on-line education company? Sounds like she just seeks personal profit, not better schools.
Not to mention Congress, teachers, parents, state governments? All you dems did a horrible job questioning @BetsyDeVos
How can she commit to something before she's had the chance to talk with others in the DOE?
SENATOR YOU VOTED AGAINST WE CITIZENS GETTING GOOD PRESCRIPTION COST CONTROLS OVER BIG PHARMA. GET OUT OF OFFICE.
Thank you, Senator Murray, for your ongoing level of outstanding work. I so appreciate your being in D.C. & working 4 the ppl!
@LisaOKC Senator Murray, can you commit to a NO vote?
@SenSchumer thank you for voting NO
All Committee Dems must vote NO as a block. This isn't politics, it's the future of our country and children. Unqualified and disqualified.
*At the federal level. Why should @PattyMurray have a say in what other states do?
@SenSchumer 
It only takes 51
@SenSchumer tall are on a witch hunt too afraid it will work better than your common core
@SenSchumer she will uphold the law she said
het patty-tell us what the DEMs have done for education for the past 8 years. come on talk to us@
Do you believe only rich parents should be allowed to choose what school their children attend?  This is our current system.
Vote NO!
keep pushing back on this nominee. Spent my professional career as  School Psychologist and PS Admin. DeVos has no credentials
@MichaelRWest1 What did the billions Obama spent on education get us??? NOTHING!
@SenSchumer   Vote No
@shondi99 Why is she smiling so much? Not against smiling but....
@shondi99 Call your reps! No on Devos!!!
Thank You Sen Murray ,for fighting for our kids and our education -I'm a mom AND a teacher !
@SenSchumer for kids with questions fill it with religion and not Science
@SenSchumer DeVos wants children with enough education to work only in coal mines not to prepare for 21st & 22nd century future
"Betsypants, actually & factually, how healthy is the Detroit School System?" #TheResistance #Trump #education
@SenSchumer yet how many democrats are going to vote yes??  Vote yes and get replaced next election!
vote no on all these ridiculous Cabinet appointments...and twice on DeVos!
@SenSchumer Sounds like a NO to me.
As a constituent of @PattyMurray I agree with Betsy DeVos. Hearing smears against her for supporting @TheFIREorg doesn't help.
That DeVos blank look is horrendous. At some point you need the self-awareness to say, "No, I'm not a good fit for this."
she looks scared out of her mind and smug all at the same time in that video! #DeVos
Government is not a private business, does not have same purpose or principals. Resist privatization.
@SenSchumer I am voting for you to lead the Schumer clown troop!
@SenSchumer You're my hero, Sen Murray! I have two children with autism! FIGHT DEVOS! She is everything wrong with education!
Vote NO. DeVos, Sessions, Tillerson, Pruitt, Carson, Price, Mulvaney, Pudzer.  Use ur ldrship so other Sen Dems do the same!
@SenSchumer please vote against her confirmation. If you have expressed that fact thanks
@SenSchumer Please check her business connections in Russia
да,всех проверить
@SenSchumer she must be stopped: Vote NO! Thank you!
@SenSchumer how about you tell us why you voted against cheaper drugs
@SenSchumer She will be nothing but trouble for our public schools
She's not qualified. get another candidate.
boots on the ground reason for #no2devos
@SenSchumer do not confirm her!
@BetsyDeVos is an outsider with fresh eyes. Since Washington has made a mess, I would like to see the outsider try and fix.
I am a constituent of yours.  PLEASE do not vote to confirm this woman.
@Cathy789 the senator behind her is ready to go to sleep! Is it that they R working too hard or just too dam old!!! #StopDevos
@SenSchumer RESIST!
@SenSchumer please don't vote for her. My children's future depends on your vote
@SenSchumer @JohnnyIsakson your voters voted on this in November and rejected it. #beourvoice
Shocking that DeVos wants kids to learn instead of test drilling to achieve funding

SMH
so get rid of standardised tests. Problem solved. Let teachers teach. Privatising isn't the answer
You seem very confused

...checks tweet history...

ohhhhhhhhhh
confused how?
@marcylauren VOTE NO. VOTE NO. VOTE NO. VOTE NO. VOTE NO.
Do not confirm Devoss
@SenSchumer Dont you dare vote to confirm one more nomination.Dems must show courage, not compliance. #courageovercompliance
Please vote NO.  As a public school, special education teacher I believe she will not prioritize my students. TY
We spend more on public ed  than just about any other country & think more $ will fix it?  ... http://tmi.me/1fhvfb 
#BetsyDeVos  is destructive for our public schools and education system.  #confirmationhearings
@SenSchumer Do not confirm this woman!
@SenSchumer Don't vote for her. She is a danger to our public schools.
@SenSchumer vote yes on Betsy DeVos!
Dont forget she paid 200 million to gop for this job nod!
@SenSchumer 
See ya, Amway girl
@SenSchumer so what is the alternative for the failing schools w/ no budget like in Chicago?
NO PUBLIC FUNDS FOR PRIVATE SCHOOLS. PERIOD.
DeVos is the good guy, you democrats are below the fray.
Thank you for keeping the truth exposed.
@SenSchumer out kids deserve better! And don't forget special education programs!
then change voting req to min high school which will rid of any minority/disability/female voting rights.  Truly repulsive !!!
My guess is #Devos push for Vouchers/private school is to reject minority applications,which will promote segregation in school
PLEASE vote "No" on her confirmation.  She completely unfit to supervise education in this country.
stand firm- NO to DeVos! @SenSchumer @SenSanders @chrislhayes @maddow @nytimes
@MorBeeK
omg I feel the same way
.@PattyMurray Great job asking strong questions; summarizing 'non-answers' intended to deceive & deflect. Vote NO on @BetsyDeVos #DeVosFacts
vote NO to Devos!  She is uniquely Unqualified!
#noDevos
vote No
yet she has donated to how many republican senators thus bought their vote. I have little hope the R's will vote to reject.
horrible! She is determined to destroy US public education
@Klopez1985  
Thanks for championing education Senator Murray!
of course. you MUST VOTE NO
might be better then the government run system.
thank you keep fighting for us!

Thank you!
Tell @SenatorCantwell to NOT approve Betsy DeVos!
I salute you for your long-term commitment to quality education. Please vote no and make this former WA resident proud!
Patty taking care of business!
Why did you vote against the @Canada drug bill. Your constituents deserve an answer. I will ask you in your office if I have to
Stand up to the rest of the nominees like you are with her.  We've got your back here at home and need you now more than ever.
Thank you for your fight, Sen Murray! DeVos SHOULD NOT be confirmed! KEEP PUBLIC SCHOOLS PUBLIC!

Please stand firm AGAINST DeVos.
@SenatorCantwell please vote NO on all further Trump nominees, especially DeVos & Sessions.

Thank you for your leadership, Senator.
