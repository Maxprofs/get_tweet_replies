@1meps @realDonaldTrump In 20 years, technology will have eliminated well over a third of.our jobs. Are we prepared?
I'm afraid not. We will still need to eat in 20 years.
.@Pattymurray Are Dems ready for hard bipartisan work to fix the ACA so someone like me can afford insurance again? @realDonaldTrump
I hope you're not holding your breath waiting for @PattyMurray to be anything other than a partisan hack. @realDonaldTrump
Nope, just sticking my two cents into the Twittersphere.
Phew! @PattyMurray @realDonaldTrump
Bernie is the only leader worth following - Greedy Sellouts everyone of you...we will not support YOU EVER!!
Thank You Senator Murray for being a strong voice against the Trump/GOP spiteful agenda. Today is a good day!
you are confused.  It is the dems who are spiteful and unwilling to even compromise.
Thank you Senator Murray for listening and supporting your constituents!  Lifesaving victory!
#VoteNoGorsuch  @realDonaldTrump needs to learn he doesn't get what he wants we'll all suffer decades http://www.newsweek.com/2016/08/19/letter-paul-ryan-donald-trump-488877.html ….
Keep fighting, my senator!
Maybe people are waking up to what Republicans have planned for the people.
YOU NEED TO BE SAYING THANK YOU OBAMA. HE WAS THE ONE THAT BROUGHT THIS NATION OFF HER KNEES.
turns out rooms full of old white men not right people to make healthcare decisions for everyone #SinglePayer
Thank you Senator!  Please hold #TrumpRussia accountable!!
For years I've watched you in WA State. You pretend to care about us, but are glaringly incompetent.
You let veterans down. Remember your tour of VA facility, declaring all is ok, nothing to see here. They died.
- repeal & replace!  And confirm Gorsuch!

.@PattyMurray
Sen. Murray thank you for representing us well.#NoAHCA
U r such a hater, Senator. And quite fond of bumper stickers.
Thank you Patty for representing the people, the vulnerable, and making it honorable to be Progressive!
A sad day for Americans when our representatives can't learn to cooperate.
You guys know that you are going to be holding the bag when the ACA causes huge rate increases?
You ma'am arent doing what taxpayers pay you to do. You support NOTHING put forth by President, just because. @PattyMurray @realDonaldTrump
Obamacare is all all about you, its a failure. Pull the subsides off it,tax payers shouldnt have to pay for it
.@PattyMurray Keep up the pressure. We're counting on you!
pls work toward single payer next
well let's just let YOUR Obamacare implode-that is a great response. Have you offered to help?
Patty, you're a woman, all you have to do for #45 to shrink into himself is be near him & talk...like Merkel.
I'm disappointed in you, Senator. You had the opportunity to participate, but put party over country. Shame.
You tell 'em Patty Murray!
could you let us know what it would take to get the ACA purring
Very interesting insight here from a real billionaire: @PattyMurray
#resistance #SavetheACA
Patty, thx 4 doing your best 4 the ppl who elected you. Pls continue to put ppl 》military industrial complex.
hates @realDonaldTrump so much lol. So much negativity from you, senator.
keep up the great work senator Murray!
Thank you!!
#EPICFAIL Forever more will be known as #TRUMPCARE
Never back down, Senator Murray. We've got your back. Proud to take the "blame" for killing the bill
Time to propose the Obamacare tweaks from Hillary to fix the flaws. Our time to shine!!
as one of your constituents, THANK YOU! #TrumpCare
Start repairing the problems with affordable care.
yyaaaaaaa! Tell em'
Thank you Senator Murray!
Gloating. How senatorial. Obviously you don't care ACA is failing millions of people who can't afford it.
Good grief, looked in a mirror lately? #Please
Now, lets get to talking about how to fix ACA. Cost limits, making states accept medicaid expansion +++
- #TrumpCare
I solute the good Republicans for standing up for people such as Jaime Herrera-Buetler.
Polls show ppl want ACA fixed, not repealed. WHY can't Dems do this? We know the GOP never will. They Complain
How about FIXING the ACA?  That would be an adult concept
Crush him like an ant, Patty!
Trump listen to the people! 
Thank you Sen Murray for listening! Keep up the fight! WA State has your back!
thank you Patty Murray for STANDING UP for Washington State and AMERICANS!
And our voices are also saying we want an independent investigation into Trump/Russia now!!!
Thanks to all!! The bill as introduced would have been devestating to families.
keep fighting Senator Murray.  I appreciate your commitment to this horrible attack on our healthcare.
Democrats have a phenomenal opportunity here to present America with a better, single-payer alternative. You need to take it!
thank you for making sure Washington State is on the correct side of these issues Patty.
Thank you for fighting for us!
Please find reasonable Rs to join you on fixing #ACA. We need cooperation from everyone, not this hope of failures.
You are so blinded by arrogance. Don't be so quick to judge what you don't understand. Americans 4 #AHCA
Thank you, Senator Murray! We the People are so proud of you and so happy that you and your colleagues in the House listened to us #noAHCA
Keep rocking it Senator!!
Actually this had more to do with people supporting politicians who were put in to REPEAL Obamacare- not to do this bill.
Yeah ok Patty your party passed Obamacare on LIES and the "stupidity" of voters #JonGruber  Good lord.
Great news! so glad this horrible bill was pulled
