Keep up the good work Patty. I'm proud to be from Washington and to have you as our senator
Repeal will fix, government involvement in healthcare is the real problem!!
U R getting there. Now if you will work it right, we will separate medicaid from the health care business. Use it for what it is for .
Why are you not supporting @SenSanders' Medicare expansion bill?
Union Machinist w/deteriorating health insurance. Single payer works for veterans, the elderly & the disenfranchised. Itâ€™ll work for America
When the government gets out of the way and allows the free market -- supply & demand to govern prices, it will work.
No it won't!
You must have a prophetic gift. It has worked in the past when given the liberty.
You have an obligation to support your state's wishes. There's already a way to come together. Support Bernie's bill.
Thanks for all you do Patty.  So proud you come from Whidbey!
You and your liberal colleagues put us in this predicament, you cannot escape that fact.
Wasn't that the argument that was used to implement our current system? Not working out? #FoolMeOnceShameOnYouFoolMeTwiceShameOnMe
Your constituents want #SinglePayer and haven't heard from you about #MedicareForAll
As a lifelong citizen of the Evergreen State and a proud Democrat I urge the Senator to Cosign #MedicareForAll
Bailing out insurance companies is not the answer Patty.
Pretty sure the fix is Medicare for all.
Please support @SenSanders Medicaid for all bill
Medicare
Single payer is not the answer, support Americans not the Insurance companies
Single prayer doesn't support insurance companies, it makes them obsolete.
Single payer grow government and control with making decisions over your healthcare. We have the best healthcare in the world,why change it
I spent $1k on 5 stitches in my thumb. When my wife cut her hand badly we decided to "see how it goes" because we can't afford that again.
Having the "best care" means nothing to people if they can't get it.
Do you trust government to make decisions for you?
Do you trust a corporation with a profit motive any more? I have more control of my government than I do Blue Cross or St Joe's.
The government has to answer to me. My insurance doesn't.
Great, so does this mean you and @SenatorCantwell are going to support @SenSanders ??
So quit bowing your neck Patty and agree with other views besides yours only.
I want a single payer system where everyone is entitled to medical treatment. I will remember your stance when your name is on the ballot.
Medicare over $7 trillion liability,Vets can't get care at VA, medicaid no better than uninsured; why do we want government in health care?
Senator, Please, please join with the Medicare for All movement with Bernie and 16 other senators!! Washington citizens deserve it!
I see a lot of posts on single payer, do you all really know what you're asking for. Get government out of health care, period.
Do we need to start making calls after @sengraham2016 press conference? Are they going to try repeal/replace again?! #FixTheACA #ACA
#SinglePayerNow
Hi, senator Murray. Will you put your support behind #MedicareForAll ? This is what we, your WA state constituents, want.
Americans will face even higher costs the more government gets involved. Let the free market do it's job!
#BigGovSucks
#MedicareForAll What are you waiting for, Senator? Get behind @SenSanders and let's win in 2018 and 2020!!!
If the Dems hadn't screwed it up, wouldn't need to be fixed!
Keep doing your unglamorous critical work! We need stabilization of ACA
If you Democrats will let go your death grip on Obamas failed Obamacare , it will happen. It was illegally enforced and a burden to all.
Improve healthcare by repealing Ocare
Well do your damn Job! You keep blaming Trump! Look in the mirror one in awhile
That's because y'all screwed the people and u don't give a shit
I'm a constituent of yours, and I want you to support @SenSanders bill for single payer Medicare for all.
How about working with your own party to change the future for the good of all? #SinglePayerNOW
As a Seattle voter, I urge you to support @SenSanders  #MedicareForAll  bill
Medicare for all
Support @SenSanders bill!
Please support @SenSanders bill. That's the path forward.
Nice to see some honesty and collaborative effort to fix Health Care issues.  As far as facing higher costs, that started in 2010.
Here are some improvements that literally the rest of the industrialized world is using:
Thank you for fighting for me and my family and the many, many others who need people like you to speak for us.
Too many businesses will not be able to expand if you don't overhaul the tax code
great news, thanks :-)
Or we could expand an already existing program to meet these goals and more. #MedicareForAll
Then support #MedicareForAll
@SusanKelleher We need #MedicareForAll
dear patty go with bernie care! medicare for all! it is what our nation needs.  a nurse
Don't "fix" ACA. Sign the Medicare for All Bill!
You want another chance to mess things up again? Try pulling your head out of the you know what and ghost away
Please support @SenSanders healthcare plan. Medicare for all.  -WA resident
Why is @PattyMurray not joining @SenSanders in support of madicare for all? This is your moment, don't let WA down
Dead end waste of time. Support #MedicareForAll!
While #MedicareForAll would be ideal, I'll take an ACA fix. Emphasis on FIX. Don't support them repealing a damned thing
UR on Obama care now rt? U know how bad it is. Oh that's rt ur special and have ur own plan
Costs are lowered when you lower regulations and taxes. Econ 101. Get less of what you tax increasing cost.
I have no use for universal coverage if 5 stitches in my thumb will still cost me $1000.
Disappointing. I support @SenSanders and #MedicareForAll
No, no, NO!  Trump/Pence are an existential threat to the nation and world. You have one job now: clean House.
So, no #MedicareForAll for you. Okay. Duly Noted.
What are you getting out of it
People need now to repair damage done by trump, so premiums &deductibles done rise and insurers don't leave market. For now it's good enuff.
 what damage by Trump? Only been in 8 months with no legislation signed. If anything, that would be Obama.
By improve, you mean you intend to support @BernieSanders Medicare for All? Because he's introducing it today. As a Seattleite, I'd dig it.
Medicare for all has 0 chance of passing right now, but the work and debate has to start now. Murray is working on a fix to obamacare which
Good point. I wish @PattyMurray would do both.
But perhaps she feels supporting #MedicareForAll now would compromise negotiations
That's my thinking. She can always jump on board on the other later. Single payer is mote a 2020 issue than 2018, but prep work is now.
You are trying to bankrupt us! There are other ways! -22 trillion in debt, war with N Korea, economic bubble, the petrodollar, 2 hurricanes
@SenSanders seems to have a great solution, how about you support it??  Apparently big pharma is more important to you than the people
Trump has sabotaged the reimbursement plans. That's why the market is unstable.
You haven't provided a counter alternative to my point. Do you always resort to name calling?
Cool. This had been enlightening. Peace out.
Not good enough. Support #MedicareForAll
