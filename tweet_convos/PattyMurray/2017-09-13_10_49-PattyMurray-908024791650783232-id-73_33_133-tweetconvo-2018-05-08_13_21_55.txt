I sure hope this isn't why you are keeping quiet about #MedicareForAll
If you care about healthcare, why haven't you backed @SenSanders #MedicareForAll plan yet? We will remember this come re-election time.
Yeah

Please please please please please please please please please please please please please support Medicare for all!!
@PattyMurray, please support Medicare for All; it is even better than Obamacare.
why did you vote for this in the first place please fix it
It's called #MedicareForAll and you should be on that bill!
Not voting for you again

I will not support you anymore unless you sign into Medicare for All.
You cannot fix it, because we weren't doing what was needed. We need Single Payer National Health insurance. Now is the time.
It's called repeal and fix the regulatory message so the free market can work
Free market has no place in healthcare debate. Look at what the free market does to price of medicine. We pay too much Bc of free market
We don't have a free market now. Ur meds cost cuz of government. Also health care slash who pays for it is not a right
Not good enough. We need #Medicare4All
Plz ditch ObamaCare fix & fight for #Medicare4All instead. #HealthcareIsAHumanRight going to reconsider voting for u next term bc of this
Might as well sign on to @BernieSanders plan to spend $1.5 trillion on Medicare for all , and finish us for good financially.
Obamacare needs fixing? I thought everything he did was perfect
Medicare for all plz. Kthanx
Please work on #Medicare4All! Healthcare is a right!
#MedicareforAll  you work for the people. Do your job and give the people what they want.
Washingtonians are waiting for our senators to do the right thing. #MedicareForAll #Medicare4All #SinglePayerNow
You will not have my vote unless you support #MedicareForAll Support the bill or loose votes.
Hello from Seattle- you are on the wrong side of history. We want, we need #MedicareForAll ! Please fix your heart and join the future!
https://senate.gov/members/ ?
Support #MedicareForAll or else you will lose my vote when you seek reelection.
Will one of the fixes include her no longer taking kickbacks from drug companies?
You are working with scum.  #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer is the ONLY answer. Do the humane thing for us WA residents and for the country!
"U.S. Sen. Patty Murray is once again showing she DGAF about her constituents"
The American people demand single payer. It's time to start helping your constituents over your donors. #Medicare4All
So you'd rather side with the republicans. Got it. Thanks for NOTHING (again), Patty.
Senator, no.
#MedicareforAll
Please stop being a shill of pharma and health insurance corporate interests and do what is right. Support  Bernie's Medicare for all.
Retire please.
We need to move forward with the rest of the world we need Medicare for all 86% of Democrats supported in 60% of the country supports it.
You couldn't look more disinterested. But thanks for taking this issue on for the American people.
Why not work with Bernie Sanders and other senators to pass medicare-for-all 86% of Democrats support it and so do your constituents.
So basically you're working on a repeal of everything democrats once stood for.
And everything the GOP stood for in the '90s Obamacare is a right wing reform. We need #SinglePayer.
Do both @Senator.No reason not 2 except 2 self-identify as a Dem unwilling 2 help unify the party via long-term @DNC objectives.#SinglePayer
You need to be working on #Medicare4All. Where are you in the press meeting going on right now? #MedicareForAll @BernieSanders
Not good enough. Support or co-sponsor Sanders' Medicare For All Bill.
What?  Let me sit down. I'm feeling chest pain. Patty is going to work with someone? I've never seen her do this.
No thanks, get on the #SinglePayer train and while you're at it talk to @NancyPelosi and pull her on board as well
We 
Want
Single 
Payer
hey could you not, instead?
This is not sustainable. We need #MedicareForAll now! Or millions will continue to die because of lack of healthcare.
That's all well and good, but we need #SinglePayer. Pls work with @BernieSanders on #MedicareForAll
Senator Murray please support #MedicareForAll hello from Tacoma
working w republicans is dumb. Co sponsor single payer already.
What the hell is wrong with you. Medicare For All!! We WANT SINGLE PAYER!! #SpinelessPatty
Move towards #Medicare4All. Stimulate economy w/$ back in pocket & less worry abt dying. Big pharma/priv ins makg$ off our lives is WRONG!
You are missing the point You & @SenatorCantwell had better bend w/ the winds of change. Healthcare for all.
We need #Medicare4All
The Majority of Americans DO NOT support Obamacare! That is a false statement! Obamacare is complete DISASTER and DEMOCRATS own it 100%!!
I guess living w/ your head in the ground is working out well for you.
Sanders 2020
@PattyMurray needs to get more of her fellow DEM's onboard since they were the ones who screwed up healthcare to begin w/ by enacting PPACA
Work w/ Bernie instead Patty.
I am tired of dem/rep Be an American and get the work done,
Keep it simple. people deserve health care ,if you have a SS number COVERD
Who pays for it??
#Medicare4All please.
can't you do this and ALSO support medicare for all?
Get out of healthcare everything government does or touches turns to corruption we don't want government in healthcare at all....
but there's healthcare in our government https://twitter.com/actualflatticus/status/907983276647833602 â€¦
Maybe Patty should just go home and stay there.
LOL she's a shorty... only about 4 ft tall but she thinks she's 10 ft tall. She needs to go home and take some meds.
The only way to IMPROVE on OC is SINGLE PAYER -Medicare for everyone
This isn't going anyone Senator. Your party is moving toward Bernie's Medicare-For-All and your stuck trying a go nowhere deal
Yeah, it's called #Medicare4All
Today, really?  On Medicare for All day? I have nothing against improving ACA but fight for what's right too! If Booker can do it so can you
I know, tone deaf.
Why aren't you for Medicare for all, it's our tax dollars, do we not have a voice on where our money goes?
We can give Sen Murray the backing she needs to suport #MedicareForAll by sharing our opinion at her office.

Scrap it.
AMEN, just Shitcan O'Kenyan care and get something simple and workable to replace it.
Like Medicare for all? That's simple.
