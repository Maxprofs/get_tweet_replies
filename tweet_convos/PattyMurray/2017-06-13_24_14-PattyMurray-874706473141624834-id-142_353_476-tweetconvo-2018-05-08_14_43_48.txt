Unfortunate @SenAlexander insists on going through w plan to Assault Health Care Aggressively with @SenateMajLdr, @OrrinHatch #HoldTheFloor
Thank you #HoldTheFloor please insist @SenatorEnzi @SenJohnThune @tedcruz  @SenMikeLee @SenTomCotton hold hearings/open meetings re #AHCA
also, plz insist @SenCoryGardner @SenJohnBarrasso @JohnCornyn @senrobportman @SenToomey hold open hearings #HoldTheFloor cc @SenatorCantwell
And they call Republicans "obstructionists"?
What an incredibly rude and tangential mansplaination!
Wow, what a bully. A snarky, mean man. And not governing for the good of anyone. I don't know how you maintain your civility, but thank you
We're terribly sorry for the behavior of @SenAlexander. We are going to try our best to elect a better Senator in 2020. #eastTNresist
Agreed! I hope he's too old (and out of touch) to run again, but if he does, my Indivisible TN6 group will help vote him out! So shameful.
TRUTH = REPUBLICANS ARE SCREWING THE PUBLIC TO BENEFIT THEIR RICH OWNERS.  SENATORS FOR SALE = REPUBLICANS
Thank you @PattyMurray #Healthcare I didn't realize that Republicans can't work in the snow.  Be strong. #canWorkinSnowstorm
From Oregon with Love - Keep up the good fight!  This is ridiculous!
Called @PattyMurray's office to thank her for this & to encourage her to keep it up. Called @SenatorCantwell to ask why not doing similar.
Sen. Murray calls for hearing on #Trumpcare, Chairman Alexander explains why it needs to stay secret. 
At this rate, @SenatorCantwell won’t get my vote at the midterms.
Lamar's a Trump stooge. He used to be a gentleman, now he's a disgrace.
funny, how is it legal to keep information about a bill you’re supposed to vote on secret?
@SenAlexander Your constituents want to see the the bill. #ShowUsTheBill
Agreed from 37066. #ShowUsTheBill
Wow, he sounds like a condescending jerk.

REPUBLICANS PROBABLY PUT IN THE BAD PARTS WITH THEIR 171 AMENDMENTS.  WE NEED UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE.
We appreciate what you are doing for the American people - keep pressuring those GOP thugs!
The Republicans. Don't. Care.  Sometimes the American people have to experience GOP policies before they get it. Abt people not Dems Senator
I'm from TN and hate thought of @SenAlexander "representing" my state. He's an out-of-touch, White-privileged, relic who needs to go!
Same here. Can't wait to see him leave office for good.
Sen. Alexander's "excuse" sounds more like a punishment. The ACA took 15 months to pass after multiple bipartisan amendments. Unethical.
Why does a bill involving anything but the Intelligence Community need to be secret exactly?
what an obnoxious jerk. Thank you for speaking out & standing up for every day people like me against arrogant jerks like him.
@PattyMurray I appreciate all you are doing to ask for transparency and fair play with the proposed trump care bill. Stay strong
That man is outrageous.Their plan to take away healthcare should be criminal and I see it as legal murder to the Americans.
I'm so embarrassed that this is my state. Really? You don't want us to see TrumpCare before it goes to a vote! Shame on you @SenAlexander
I don't care if Republicans pass their bill in a snowstorm or in the middle of the night, so long as they do it with 60 votes
This is what American politics looks like when it hits rock bottom. #SaveACA #Resist #sad
Is this rock bottom?
TRUTH = REPUBLICANS ARE SCREWING THE PUBLIC TO BENEFIT THEIR RICH OWNERS.  SENATORS FOR SALE = REPUBLICANS.
Seems to me @SenAlexander didn't hear the question & confusing #AHCA with #ACA We want hearings on miserable @GOP #ACHA #misogyny #resist
a fact Senator, all war is started  by men. Look at the shape of bullets or even arrows. You experienced the Penus effect. Sad!
I'm glad you tried to get an answer, the nerve of him and the rest of them to keep us all in the dark! Keep speaking up for us!
Proud of you. Persevere!
Gals I don't care if you vote for your favorite waitress for a seat in Congress, get these misogynists out of Congress now. End fem slavery
We all want transparency in government. Hiding  major legislation from half the Senate & all America is a crime.
Senate & Hse women-get together & finf ways to tell misogynists to f off, firmly politely courteously! Stop thanking them 4 being asshats!
What an ass !! he is
That was awesome Senator. Stand your ground. More power to you.
Well done. We keep our heads and our decorum when surrounded by clowns.
Always proud of our Wa. State Senators...stay on the Patti!
Sen. Murray, very calm & to the point. @SenAlexander is defensive & petty. Total bullshit trying 2 deflect what's really impt - transparency
That's my senator. Go get em Patty!
Next time demand he quit talking & say Americans don't want their bill crammed down our throats in the middle of a heat wave.
Thank you @PattyMurray for trying!
Rambling answer about something in the past that is not what current bill is. Senile old man. To think I used to respect him. #Nashville
These old men need to quit acting like spoiled little boys and realise who they work for! Hide legislation and pass in a dark vote - wrong!
True traitors
Ladies, don't you dare let any Repub or man speak to that way, including the only R i have respect for, Mccain. Who the f do you think u r
I dont care what they pass, they r all going down with Trump bye bye u old goat, we will abolish everything they do next election, if not...
THANK YOU SEN MURRAY, DON'T BACK DOWN!!!
Will it change voters? I hope
Disgraceful!
Don't apologize to that arrogant senator. He doesn't deserve any respect IF he is not going to give any respect!!!
Thank you for speaking up for the American people @PattyMurray; the Chairman's response was certainly NOT adequate and is greatly troubling
People actually voted for these misogynist self entitled men who have no respect for anyone? He is VILE
Such hysterics from Alexander!
Ever notice how male Republicans cannot look a female senator in the face, or refrain from interrupting them? "We're adults here"...are we?
Hey @SenAlexander! I am bipolar and on TNcare. Without TNcare, I can't afford treatment that keeps me stable. So what's in your bill?
We're spreading the word.  Thank you Sen. Murray!!!!  #RESIST
Time for @SenAlexander to retire. Equal time needs to be given to AHCA as was demanded for ACA. Hypocrites and thieves
Thank you for trying.
What I want to ask is, why don't you -bluntly- correct him when he keeps intentionally making this about Obamacare? Make him answer on AHCA
One more rude R man being a bully and only caring about his party
Thank you @PattyMurray for representing your constituents well... please keep up the fight!
WOW!  What an indignant dick!
This is important!!! We in TN will call and give him @SenAlexander hell, but everyone start calling your Senators. Eeeek!
@SenAlexander Has something to do with his relationship w/Big Insurance?! There is no good human reason to not make this public.
Deflection and outright lies are running @GOP. The Q was nothing about ACA. what I heard "you had your chance this is our toy".
Alexander is a Republican obstructionist. Probably singing Kumbaya today.
How can they think passing a healthcare bill that the people they are supposed to represent haven't seen is a good thing?  Idiots.
Thank you Senator Murray for standing up to lying, bullying, horses-asses like Senator Alexander.
Go get him. He totally blew off and never answered your question about whether there'd be a hearing re: healthcare bill.
Good job Patty.   Sen. Alexander is totally out of line.
It sure didn't take much to rile @SenAlexander! Ooh boy, the Mom in Tennis Shoes touched a soft spot.
Want to screw us face down ,so we can't see it. They think we are stupid.
You should fix ACA rather than try to undermine it.
I'm from TN. I'm in strong opposition to ACHA & to @SenAlexander.  He was dismissive & rude- we deserve answers and hearings! You're right!
Gez you have to have thick skin and calm nerves to be a senator.
Thank you for this! Don't allow old men to shush you or try and shame you into being quiet. Keep at it.
Pelosi said, "You have to pass it to find out what's in it". Turnabout is fair play. You set the standard with Obamacare.
People are getting pretty tired of these weak displays in the face of GOP disregard for the people of the US at the expense of the rich!
"Explains" ?  These people are drunk with power. Distractions are going to give cover to this biggest ripoff the GOP are writing into a law!
There is NO reason it should be secret unless they simply want to screw everyone over without giving Dems the chance to fight it.
25 words or less old man.
Time for withholding consent on all Senate business until @SenateGOP #ShowUsTheBill in an open & fair hearing.  Thank you!
How many requests have they denied now? Talk about how all on repubs now.Let nation know who is responsible! Dems should keep hands off.2018
Thanks @PattyMurray! for pushing the question! Our senators will be hearing from us, too!
#resist
Thank you for sharing and trying to advocate for transparency, responsiveness and open discussion around health care.
Thank you Sen. Murray. Please continue to do everything you can to stop, slow down or obstruct this insane attempt to sneak #TrumpCare thru
Patty, you're following Obama's command "Resist, obstruct, impede"! You're fired!
My, what a bunch of disrespectful men. You were not asking abt ACA, but abt AHCA. Keep at it, Republicans are wrong and deceitful.
good god
That's not an explanation. He rambles but doesn't say why.  What a load of crock
uh nancy pelosi said we cant ride obamacare until after we pass it 

your delusional and sick mind speaks volumes
Thank you Senator, for representing us and calling out the BS from the right.
thanks for trying
WHERE was your call on Obamacare!!! You were silent.  So Liberal. NOT A FAN #TERMLIMTES
Keep at them @PattyMurray ! Thank you!
Thank you, Senator Murray, for your tenacity in the face of condescending *foul language redacted*.
We have to pass the bill to find out what's in it......
Keep it up, Senator.
Keep demanding transparency about the AHCA, Senator @PattyMurray! Don't let them sneak this garbage bill through in secret!
Whodoes your hair
thank you for standing your ground and speaking up for American citizens and our need to know what is in the healthcare bill.
Thousands of thanks to you Sen. Murray!  You are a true patriot. Keep pushing for democracy.
do they need dems vote to pass bill?
Not under reconciliation. .. 50 votes plus pence..
I think they all need to be reminded who they ACTUALLY work for, not the lobbyists & their donors.
Keep it up @PattyMurray ! Please continue to fight for an open process related to #TrumpCare. Why are they hiding it?
"Explains." Right. He's way out of line.
Thanks Patty!! You rock!
Well he seems nice.
I would not classify his rhetoric as an explanation; it's a dodge.
@PattyMurray we are counting on you to make this visible to your constituents. No need for secrecy. Ever.
Thank you @PattyMurray , for asking the question.  It is appalling that @SenAlexander would be so dismissive and insulting. Keep pushing.
FIFTY SEVEN MEETINGS TO DISCUSS THE ACA -- WTF PATTY???? Stop wasting our money.
It took two yrs to pass the ACA.  Health insurance is complicated.
Democrats make it complicated. We need people who r better at what they do in Congress bc these guys suck. 57 mtgs...stop wasting my money
This is un-American, period.
I saw you at DCA the other day but I needed to pee too badly to give you a hug and thanks for your ongoing efforts on our behalf.
@SenateDems Need to keep doing this. Make noise. @DickDurbin @NancyPelosi
Nothing you discuss should be secret. Americans are done with your lying secret bull crap!
I've never heard so much obfuscation and bullshit from one man...
Unacceptable. Withold consent,
Keep up the pressure!
.@PattyMurray remains professional as Alexander adopts combative, disrespectful tone of someone avoiding responsibility.
Methinks the senior senator from Tennessee doth protest too much.
Patty stuff as sock in his mouth! Women Dems STAND UP AND FIGHT!

#saveaca #fixthedamnaca
Let's not forget GOP is trying to ram through their new Health Despair bill while country focused on Sessions
We appreciate your persistence.
