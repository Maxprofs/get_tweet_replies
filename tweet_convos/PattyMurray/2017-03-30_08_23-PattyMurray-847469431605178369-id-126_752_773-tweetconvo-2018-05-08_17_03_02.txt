President Trump and Republicans in Congress simply aren't getting
the message when it comes to access to health care. #TitleX
Republicans are continuing on their extreme, anti-women agenda,
rushing to roll back a rule that protects family planning providers. #TitleX
Feel like women have going to have to fight for rights like for the vote suffragette all over again
Yep !! ALL OVER AGAIN.
So basically, if it comes down to it, he'll vote against women's health. Does he have a daughter?
Does he hate his wife?  His mother?
probably doesn't hate but sure doesn't think they are his equal
: He is a strict right wing religious conservative.  Very narrow minded.
His religion has no place in our lives for any reason.
I'm a spiritual person & respect other's religion. But I find this odd. How do you avoid being around women? More than 1/2 of pop is female.
There is a real difference between being spiritual and being religious.
...and of course, believing in GOD
His hatred of anyone who's not a white straight Christian wealthy male is disgusting.  #resist #notmyvp
He did.  Pro birth.  Anti children and women
GOD IS FREE WILL-so what is Pence a liar n church! Give freely God says. Pence takes unwilling-who does that he a Muslim
@Vickigr81567276 @mike_pence everyone get to the phones and call your senators if they are republicans
@zenyatta1411 @PattyMurray @Vickigr81567276 @mike_pence This makes me wonder how Karen Pence champions women & children
Same way protesters spread Christ's love by screaming @ ppl
Y wld Jesup be diminished by screaming Weak arg
I can't imagine Jesus would be ok with ppl screaming at others about their healthcare decisions in his name. Not loving or compassionate.
That can be prevented by making sure the chamber is empty except for one woman.
lmao
Trump & Pence sure do make a great team! One hates women & the other sexually assaults them
Unfortunately, he went to the senate & cast the deciding vote to stop funds 4 PP as the @GOP continues the "WAR ON WOMEN"
Yet he won't meet with a woman alone. #unqualified #TitleIX
"woman's health"  -- really just code for baby-killing by those unwilling to take responsibility for their sexual misbehavior.
Why?? Because women are strong and can take down these guys. They are trying to take our equality because they can't compete fairly.
That is not critical care it is spin control, the pill, condoms, tubes tied that is birth control.
What can we do to stop this hateful anti-women agenda?
@SenToomey will never be on the right side; just the GOP PUPPETS side
#DUMPCONGRESS VOTE TO REMOVE EVERY CONGRESSIONAL MEMBER REPLACE THEM ALL WITH PROGRESSIVES SET TERM LIMITS AT 4 terms ! no retirement !!
broke tie. Family Planning Funding! Thank YOU Patty for trying! Women - declare war on GOP NOW! #TheResistance #PP
@naretevduorp @mike_pence omg.....Why are men deciding on our healthcare?  Can we have a room full of women decide on men's?
Exactly!
Just because some women refuse to be "punished with a baby" doesn't mean that taxes should support killing them for convenience sake.
Well, young women & men of America, now you know what happens when Republicans win control of government.
Didn't they just have a women empowerment session yesterday, and then turn around and do this?  Horrible. Can we just Impeach Trump already?
Many women support Pence. Stop acting like you represent all women

You people have absolutely lost your minds.
AKA that woman hater may be going to vote for the rights of unborn & forced taxpayer funding PP=baby blood $$=Dem$$
And he did exactly that. :-(
Pence hates women
As a Bible literalist,#Pence regards women as Eve spareribs, temptresses, & baby machines.Any wonder he just blocked women’s health funding?
Who Cares
Until men face the same issues as women do, they have no right to make decisions for & about women's healthcare. NONE, NADA, NEIN, NIET!
4 words..... Bad news for women!
Nothing he has done has surprised me. He needs to be exposed for what he truly is. We can't believe one thing he says. Keep fighting.
He did. Pence, your cruelty won't go unpunished. Not in this world or the next. Let's flip all red districts!
No Pence is anti-stupidity you do not represent ALL women, tolerance is a two-way street u will never walk down!!
He is a cowardly man who will fall under his leader.
So shameful.  All they have done to date is to hurt the most vulnerable people in the country
HALF of the babies you want KILLED, Patty, are female. Pence does not want them killed = he is FOR FEMALES! DUHHHHH  @VP #MAGA
Any man that is anti woman has male insecurity issues. As a male I see it all the time. Little men trying to control those that threat them
Pence is a little man.
Patty Murray is in favor of killing babies. Just because they're not born yet, STILL BABIES! And Trump made comments decades ago. Got it Pat
More bull$hit from POLITIC PATTY...BEEN IN DC FOR +20  YEARS!!!
The nation's women security is in question with the leader of the He-Man Women Hater's Club as a tie-breaking vote. VP, side with women, plz
Pro-life does not mean anti-women. Pro Abortion does not mean killer.  Each has their own perspective.
Has everyone signed THIS? The legal removal of The President & Vice  President, et al., for Misprision of Treason -
It will be war against Pence if he does this a second time.
do NOT bully mboy mickey p hes to qt for
@SenateDems @mike_pence wow do better or get out! Politics may not be your bag you're not very good at it #draintheswamp
Mike Pence blames women for war on women
Quit LYING.  There is NO anti-women agenda.  SPELL IT OUT IF YOU HAVE ANY PROOF.  Democrat LYING & PANDERING yet again!
Do you suppose #Pence will ask himself, "how would Christ vote?"
WILL #PENCE BRING HIS WIFE TO ACT AS |..#PrayerWarrior for the #Trump Administration? You know, to ward off Russian #PrayerAssassin's? https://twitter.com/pattymurray/status/847469431605178369 …
How can a devout Christian woman such as Mother Pence possibly allow him to do this? Oh, right. Never mind.
So it's fucked.
Look at it from his Perspective: if God wanted women equal in treatment, he would've left those parts out when he created them.
gotta keep those christian birth rates up!
But in his defense, that big stud Pence only eats dinner with his wife, what a guy
@gop has no empathy starting with @potus, the FatGloriousLeader in charge on down. They are despicable people.
Womens bodies & health should never be up for a vote. My body, my decisions. And all women deserve health care.
You have no clue what an anti-woman agenda is!  Deal with the REAL war on women!
A high school guard in KSA only duty is to make sure women are caged until their guardians or drivers come  https://twitter.com/Remavvi/status/847088046344429568/video/1 …
@SenateDems @mike_pence enuf of these "men" running OUR agenda! Ladies, stand up!
we re doomed
PENCE JUST FUCKED OVER WOMENS HEALTHCARE....
@SenateDems @mike_pence Shocking to think that the government may not fund the murder of babies!!!!
. Why should tax payers pay for abortions for women who practice unsafe sex. Some have more abortions than birtdays.
@naretevduorp @mike_pence - Wow he has been MIA - thought Trump had him locked in Closet
You are a sick group to deny women their healthcare. How dare you.
@ghhshirley @mike_pence Call your REPS!
omw!  Ladies coming 4 ur wombs
@SenateDems @mike_pence @VP isn't anti-women, just won't eat or drink with them..
That's strange considering Pence has a vagina.
And is a vagina.
@SenateDems @mike_pence Please don't let that happen. The Vice President doesn't believe in women's health issues of any kind.
We know how he's going to vote.
Is his wife coming too?
we will remember. We will fight. We will persist. And we will vote you out. Pence, Trump, Ryan.  You are gone.
Maybe. The left has a bad habit of disagreeing w/itself. We throw all issues in & then argue over that, forgetting the main objective.
we can thank Drumpf for uniting us in opposition to his hateful agenda.
@SenateDems @mike_pence does anyone commenting in agreement to Sen Murray even know what #titlex is really about?
"leader of anti-woman agenda?"  Wow. If you didn't know @PattyMurray was dishonest before...
Can someone with a vagina please have a voice once in a while, Mr. Pence?
@SenateDems @mike_pence 

Patty, you don't speak for all women.
@SenateDems @mike_pence  VP Pence you're a total disappointment.
You're joking, right?  Pence's career is based on being a far right religious extremist.
sad day for america
@Leticia17922167 @PattyMurray @mike_pence It certainly is a sad day. And highlights the misogyny of this admin & GOP.
Go to your state legislatures and harp on them to forward your agenda!!
@SenateDems @mike_pence more lies and identity politics. No wonder @TheDemocrats continue to lose.
utter lunacy...whoops did I say "utter"?
@SenateDems @mike_pence Why are these MALE politicians deciding what should and shouldn't be involved in our health?
you need to convince just one more fed up R. Keep at it
You lost!! Live with it!! Keep Federal Government out of healthcare!!
@SenateDems @mike_pence Pence was just given an achievement award by working women's group; Pretty sure won't vote for women
@DemocracyValues @mike_pence whew. Well thank God he has a dick. WTF?!?!
Well we know how this will end.
VP @mike_pence does not care about women's health. Nor does DT. Most of the GOP don't. They only care about money & power.
disgusted once again
Money over Human Rights will define the Trump Presidency and will haunt Mike Pence for the rest of his life.
NOT another Pnce vote to inflict more harm on Americans!!
well I think we can all guess how he'll vote - his behavior is that of a man who sees women as second to men
Dear Pence. You're not a woman. Don't pretend to know what we NEED.
;) i know wut u need ;))))))))))))

@naretevduorp @mike_pence omg.....tell these men to mind their OWN business....and stay out of MINE
I will geo tag all wombs
thank you for fighting.
UGH. NOT qualified.
wow, hopefully he comes to his senses and votes for the rest of America.
@naretevduorp @mike_pence   Ready to 
Make sure he isn't left alone with the bill.
Guess we know which way it'll go...
This event is the one thing he will NOT attend with his wife.SMH
unacceptable
to bad. hope it fails
