@KING5Seattle @HouseDemocrats Patty Murray is the dumbest Democrat in the Senate, even with Boxer still there. Political hack
@KING5Seattle @HouseDemocrats I'd love to keep families safe. What you're proposing feels good but doesn't DO good.
@KING5Seattle @HouseDemocrats you're another reason I'm glad I'm leaving Washington State next month for good.
