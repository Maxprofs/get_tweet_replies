You won't like it no matter what. More faux outrage.
She'd probably like it if it were a decent health care bill.
Sen. @PattyMurray votes with Lawyers, Big Pharma and Lobbyists. Follow the money, honey. = )
Sen. @PattyMurray votes with the Democratic Party 97% of the time. No possible way the Dem party line benefits Washington State 97%.
The @BernieSanders beat @HillaryClinton 70/30 in Washington State and @PattyMurray promptly cast her superdelegate vote for Clinton.
REPUBLICANS, YOU WILL PAY A GIGANTIC PRICE FOR UR GLUTTONOUS & SELFISH BEHAVIOR RE:HEALTHCARE!
Awesome Senator! GOP knows this is a horrible bill. Is the ACA perfect? No!!! But if this bull fails, trump
Trump will let ACA just explode and go haha! Told you so! It can be fixed... it can!! We can call it Trump care and clap even!
Funny, I remember hearing, and reading, all about it for months before it was passed. Were you hiding under a rock, plugging your ears?
You are ignorant and too bad people follow you! Shameful! Sure you aren't with Putin?
Please keep up angry rhetoric. Ensures more #GOP victories.
What about middle class families forced to pay unaffordable premiums w/ridiculous co-pays? Who speaks for them?
Wait until you see your coverage with coverage if this passes! The GOP + Dems can fix it! But GOP wants the RSC cut for uber rich
It was self-employed middle class who got squeezed w/sky high premiums and useless copays.
Thank you Senator Murray!
The deplorable line didn't work so well last year
Keep fighting the good fight.
u showed with the ACA u do not have the intelligence to be involved in HC. That travesty of a bill is an epic failure just like u
Miss Murray our government is not God. You seem to think government should take care of all our needs instead of God.
Government is a tool of the people. It should do what we want it to. And we'd like it to make sure everyone has access to good health care.
YAASS, Sen. Murray!!
Put 'em in the Deplorable Basket.
We're counting on you to do whatever is legally possible to defeat this!
Thank you! I'm at a town hall meeting and people are terrified!
What is going on at your meeting?
I'm your constituent senator. Please keep fighting deadly Trumpcare with every tool available. Lives depend on it.
Lucky! I have Flake and McCain
How does it feel when you're on the receiving end of what you did to us with the ACA. "You can read what's in the bill when it passes."
Mark!!! Bull crap read! 18 months of committee meetings, 167 rep amendments.. debate! The GOP was more upset the bill from a Black Pres
You're in denial. Pelosi quote: You'll have to read the bill to find out what's in it.
Yes they have and before that it was democrats and before that it was republicans and before that it was democrats and so on and so forth...
Amen, sista!
Patty can go to heck with her hand basket.
You Lying Phonies! Keep your Plan?! Keep Your Doctor?! $2500.00 Reduction?!! #Sickening
They learned something from you...
Thank you for all the work and efforts you're doing against #Trumpcare!
If only we had more leaders like you
Why don't our Dem Senators protest and sit on the floor outside Mitch's office? We the people are looking for leadership -tangle ACTIONS
Absolutely! @GOP's hard at work pulling a fast one over Americans' eyes -- UNLESS WE STOP THEM! CALL YOUR SENATORS TODAY!
What's the Rush? Moving forward only makes bad Bills come faster...opposition by obstructing is a long standing lawmaker's tactic. Slow Down
We NEED MORE WOMEN IN OFFICE. #ItApparentlyTakesAWoman
@fight4women Please fight for those who have no voice!
You've done everything possible to screw the working man
How in a civilised democratic society can a bill be passed without being read by all the members of a governing chamber.
Not civilised, not democratic.
I believe Senator Murray just called crap, crap in the nicest way she knew how. Keep it up senator.
I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out: I'll pay you a hundred dollars in cash if you punch Mitch McConnell right in the face.
Seriously?! And you voted for Obamacare which did exactly the same! You gave your constituents a turd to fix and blame it on the GOP? Wow!
We're all on the same side. That is what we all need to keep in mind.
TRUMPCARE is an abomination.
I heard Bernie Sanders say he will be introducing a "Medicare for All" bill very soon. Will you (finally) commit to signing on"? We need you
When & where is your emergency HC meeting on new bill? Plz.
Please keep up the strong work.... We depend on you. #NoTrumpcare
Keep fighting Patty. Proud to have you representing me in Washington.
GO, GO, GO! Washington State thanks you!
WOW! The Republicans really don't have the courage or ethics to do the right thing
Very disappointed Patty. When did Obama care ask the American people to get involved in the Democrates healthcare. Huh?
Republican voters have a huge chip on their shoulder. They have drunk the Kool Aid that Obamacare has wronged them. Rise above their level.
Patty! Please portray the Dem's alternative. Lay the plans side by side fshow the public we are beyond contempt, that we care.
You shoved Obamacare down our throats. My wife's recent surgery cost $72k, twice the cost of exact same one in 2013. You are all hypocrites
Sounds familiar #WeMustPassItSoYouCanSeeWhatsInIt
That quote is taken completely out of context.http://www.snopes.com/pelosi-healthcare-pass-the-bill-to-see-what-is-in-it/ …
Republicans made 116 additions to the ACA at the invitation of the Democrats. if they say they didn't it's a damn lie and they know it..
Please do all you can.
Unfortunately they are better at strategy & vileness than Dems. @SenateDems @CharlesMBlow it's all about $ not care.pic.twitter.com/mz0RAOccBL
Join Hillary in the woods Patty.
Deplorable? Where have I heard that before?

Go Patty! More than half of these morons have no idea why they're still supporting Ryan's crap-shoot health plan.
Seems you have read it already. Or are you just repeating what you hear without substantiating it?
You are deplorable, Senator. Your hypocrisy stinks to high heaven!
You Democrats single-handedly ruined healthcare for every American the government should not be in the healthcare business.
Well you should know you started it all
As @PattyMurray is waving the BIG Anti#Trumpcare flag makes one wonder what they have up their sleeve that they are trying to distract from.
pls talk to Ms Pelosi great leader but we need fresh blood for next year she should bow out gracefully

Thank you Senator Murray.
It's Simply Wrong For Legislation That'll Affect 100% of The American People To be negotiated Behind Closed Doors Gov Mike Pence 2010
That's why the @GOP working group produced a draft and not final legislation to be voted on.
If a decent healthcare bill doesn't pass, these poor people's patience is going to run out. Then I pity all those who brought this on.
Thank you Senator for speaking out on Republican & Secret 13's despicably UnAmerican process! Keep fighting for Real People's health care!
Don't relent! No Hearing, No Vote.
Was it deplorable when your party shoved Obamacare down our throats in the middle of the night with no GOP votes? You are a hypocrite.
Sour grapes. You wouldn't be happy anything Republicans came up with. You are the one whom destroyed the American health care system.
Your as bad as Hillary...."deplorable"
