We need a Labor Secretary who makes sure workers get paid what they have earned & are treated fairly in the workplace.
President Trump promised to put workers first. But picking Andrew Puzder to lead @USDOL is another sign he intends to break that promise.
Mr. Puzder has spoken out against raising the minimum wage & against efforts to help more workers get overtime pay.
Workers like Angel have shared horrific stories of lost wages, overtime violations, harassment, & more at chain restaurants #Puzder oversaw.
Not only is Andrew Puzder uniquely unqualifiedâ€”but his decision to pick and choose what laws he himself follows is disqualifying.
You should think about Americans more and not Illegal immigrants and refugees. Tax payers are more a priority
.@PattyMurray There are fewer jobs, it was even referred to as a"jobless recovery". Mechanization is lessening the need for workers.
@SenSchumer you both have caused damage to our Republic, our Military, Washington, NewYork, you should be tried for Treason
We need real senators no angry agitators and pathetic sore losers dem @TheDemocrats @MiceeMouse @adjunctprofessr
I agree it's time that they stop speaking for us
@SenSchumer @PattyMurray you are the reason we ate struggling
Bon appetit.
How very 7-ish. Juvie internet memes: Favorite tool for those unable to articulate an original thought.
For the eleventeenth time, what have you been doing the last 25 years?
For the eleventeeth time, pick up a goddamn newspaper.

Are you aware of how many people in WA state lost their jobs during Obama's reign? It doesn't appear you cared. But now? pffft!
YES AND LET PRESIDENT TRUMP DO HIS JOB AND PICK HIS CABINET ....
@SenSchumer what we need is the democrates  to stop acting like home grown terrorists
U mean the way Obama prioritized America's workers' interests?
((((CHUCKLES)))))
He prioritized self
.@PattyMurray I believe a lot of the ire witnessed in the election was due to failed economic policy in post-Recession US.
So far your feeble attempts to derail nominations has = 0-12. Just think of how much good you could have done for US instead
That shit will never happen under this SCARY ADMINISTRATION.  THEY DO NOT HAVE THE PEOPLE'S INTERESTS AT ALL PRIORITIZED.
Dear @PattyMurray @SenSchumer , when you picked Angel Gallegos to speak was it for 'color' , the context ironic obesity , or the crutches ?
@SenSchumer if Dem's just stop being obstructionist, socialist, and Nazi's, ppl and the free markets will find their way.
Struggling after 8 yrs of Obama, and you're butt-kissing support for his policies. 25 yrs you've been there, this all you have?
What a wasted effort! Do you even remember why you were elected? Working on America's problems I guess is no longer priority
@SenSchumer You will lose again.
Elections have consequences. A President has the right to choose his cabinet. #DealWithIt #MAGA
but yet Washington still voted @PattyMurray back into office and she's still an elected official
yet she's still in office. How can this old hag still be in office!
@SenSchumer like ur party did last 8 yrs? O that's right my bad. It's y u lost election
& we need a senator that doesn't vote for big Pharma over human beings. I've voted for U every time you've run. Never again !
If only you had s say in the matter.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Trump has already created more jobs in two weeks than you have EVER created in your entire life!
How about letting those workers buy cheaper drugs from Canada?
#Hypocrit
Well that is not #puzder. He will NOT prioritize workers' interests, only business needs.  @SenateGOP @SenateDems Vote NO
Which means, NOT the current appointee.
@SenSchumer Why would you care now?
why didn't you do something when u had both houses of congress. To say it's this Labor app. Fault is wrong. Pass the buck.
@fightfor15. If your a working class person check to check .fight for fifteen .there aren't any republicans who will.grassroots
Maybe if the minimum wage increases wouldn't price unskilled workers out of the market, they wouldn't be struggling as much.
Won't get it with the next Swamp rat ready to ruin the country
oh, go get yourself a new hairdo, its 2017. its blocking the thinking part of your brain, get some air into that big 4 head
@SenSchumer  Super hypocrite Patty Murray speaks again. #notmysenator #hypocrite #destroyingwashingtonstate #antiamerican
what have you been doing for the last 8 yrs??? Now you're worried? Please...
they've been allowing thousands of h1b workers in who work like slaves sleep in their offices so they can send $home
Excuse me? Unemployment rate at a all time low under Obama. 4.3%. I quote O "anyone that wants a good paying can have one".
theres a reason so few follow u. Ud go off the cliff if they told u 2 did u wear ur vajay on ur head & march
patty scum like u r the reason everyone is out of work. Dems like u need to leave congress and maybe America. U r not wanted
says the woman who supported crooked hillar who doesn't care about workers but her own $$$ PLEASE DO UR JOB 4 once
u r a public servant do more than words obama time is over it is noe @realDonaldTrump TIME GET W IT
oh please lady u want the benefits for u just like obama had it; we have a good president w good cabinet choices  ur blah
after 8 yrs of Obama, why is this so? Time for change not the same useless crap. God bless @realDonaldTrump
@SenSchumer Unlike how you went after DeVos because the NEA cares so much for employees and students - I am sure concerned!
Don't know what cha got, till it's gone. 
2 late. Go pound salt.
<==This from the disgrace who stole earned benefits from military families while funding food stamp ads in Mexico. @SenSchumer
Workers are struggling because of the economic blight of the past 8 years caused by you and your party.
Man, crazy how people forget shit like wars and high gas prices before Obama lol
You are working in a bubble - please turn your attention to convincing those who do not currently agree with your efforts
they're "still struggling" because of obama and ur policies. It is insane to want to keep that going.
and to protect those under DOL/OWCP program who got hurt/ill while serving America. #peacecorps
riiight. When's the last time that happened, under ctrl of both parties?
@SenSchumer  and why are they struggling?  Could it be Dems what happened in the last 8 yrs if they are still struggling
Vote NO
@SenSchumerPeople out of work it's because you're wonderful Obama http://failure.You  and your radical Democrats voted out
@SenSchumer unlike u both @realDonaldTrump knows how to #createajob watch him as he works...u may learn something
then why is @PattyMurray still an elected official from Washington? @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump
Oh crap...HAIL TO THE UNIONIST!!!...
I agree
What happened then the past 8 years?
@SenSchumer  Obamas policies hurt workers, not help. Trump has done more for workers in 2 weeks than Obama did in 8 yrs
@SenSchumer what did the last Secretary of Labor do for these people. Now you're asking for a new SoL to save them
WOW out of thousands of employees you could only find a few to testify. STOP the childish games, grow up & work for the people
@SenSchumer then tell me one thing you have done for the American worker?
@SenSchumer And is that Patty Murray?
rant about Sec of Labor.
Sec of Labor now that you have lost all the other fights so far? Better get Liz off her dung pile to start working on racist
@SenSchumer So quit obstructing and confirm.
You mean after 8 years of the great Obama recovery, people are still struggling???? Moron. Did Chuck say to start working on
@SenSchumer secretary of labor is not an advocacy group for workers
@SenatorCantwell Wouldn't it be great if the Dems could deliver the jobs like Pres. Trump and the GOP?  Dems=Obstruction.
@SenSchumer stick to the Constitution and stop big gov. #powertothepeople. Keep gov small
@SenSchumer Yeah Patty, what have you been doing past 25 years? Patty? Patty? ...crickets....#whyyoulost
@SenSchumer I agree as long as it is American workers.  And we get big gov out of our daily lives.
@BrianLewisS1 we have to accept POTUS piks rep looking the other way. Mass public pressure needs to cry & support IMPEACHMENT!
just be aware: impeachment requires Republican support; how many GOP's are ready for that?
@SenSchumer instead we have one bent on killing minimum wage, safety regulations to protect workers, and unions that protect.
you had your chance but did nothing as usual I thought Obama and you did such a great job on jobs why so many still struggling
@SenSchumer as a blue collar worker I can tell you the number one issue for us is job growth. Deregulate and put us to work.
@SenSchumer Washington state said they don't have enough smart people they have to get them from other countries # Very said
patty loves that bc motor voting keeps illegals voting 4 her
@SenSchumer anyone who believes a 70 year old scrooge is going to pick WE over the ME is living in a sad state of denial!
Thank you Mam!
@SenSchumer What has been happening for the last 8 yrs. can't be fixed in 3 wks. Dems are dead.
@SenSchumer need to get rid of career politicians
well the just vote yes and its done. no one listens to chucky tears just vote yes
Like raising the minimum wage? Creating jobs that aren't low paying jobs? Or Slave labor in detention centers?
Workers are struggling because of the last 8 years if inaction and regulation from the left. Let the adults take care of it.
@ImpactDemocracy  Gov't IS the problem ~
@SenSchumer Right to work across all states, start counting all people unemployed not just those out temporary just to  good
I've worked in mgmt. for corp. America. They love right to work - means right to fire w/o cause.
Schumer is a pathetic little man.  Sessions "turns his stomach."  I'm sure your right with him.  #CNN
In other words, NOT Puzder!!
get off of your high horse after you just voted no on a affordable pharmaceutical bill
Your party had the White House for 8 years and that excuse for a POTUS cancelled his jobs counsel, remember?
Stay strong. Continue the fight. Your constituents support your efforts.
That's what we need, but doubt that we'll get it. Keep fighting.
- Andy Puzder, Secretary of Labor, Nominee
- Support Andy Puzder, Secretary of Labor, Nominee
Thank you Senator.
Agreed. But the littlest tsar, djt, doesn't care about workers, only himself! People need to think before voting!
max u might have to WORK!
you do not represent eastern Washington! Quit obstructing #pattymurray @MariaCantwell
he will...even the undocumented who contribute billions to our economy
and we pay billions 4 them being here so quit the propaganda
Exactly.  Confirm Puzder!
