So, @PattyMurray, will you confirm that you will vote NO on her confirmation? 
@sidnknj 
#TheResistance
As an educator she scares me. As a mother she terrifies me.  Say no to DeVos!
thank you
As a constituent, I implore you to vote #NoOnDeVos.
thank you, Senator Murray! Proud to have you as my senator.
Yep, you better believe her. She is on point.
Thank you for leading and serving. You set an example of how our legislators should be. You have my vote on any day.
She is a menace to education! DENY THIS CONFIRMATION PLEASE
AMWAY SCHOOLS!!!!!
Thank you! Please vote NO on #DeVos and urge your colleagues to do so as well! @PattyMurray
Vote No on DeVos. As a constituent, I'll be calling your office today with the same message.
pfft ~ ya think... Just follow Sanders lead on everything, whenever you feel like a lost puppy ~
or poorly answered questions. She is woefully unqualified to head any education, even a preschool.
please do everything in your power to stop this nomination. Our children will suffer greatly
@SenatorCantwell you must vote NO on all these positions!
I'm on SSDI disabilty and on Medicare since I was 27. Please remember me! ~ Jennifer Laybourn WA state
please vote NO on DeVos!
who will join you? Collins? Murkowski?
Do not confirm!
Stop DeVos!  She only cares about making money from screwing our kids.
I agree and don't believe she would contribute the American people in this position- we can do so much better.
send her back to school
As a recently ex-republican, you have my vote, Senator Murray!
NO to DeVos!
She is not qualified. She has no relavant experience and too much conflict of interest.
the biggest question- why? She has no business being there.
thank you, Senator Murray.

please, I'm an ELL teacher here in WA fight against DeVos so u don't lose another Nat'l Brd certified teacher. I'm terrified!
Thank you for fighting for our children.  Very proud you represent our state and country..
Thank you for standing up to challenge this nomination.
She has NO place to lead the Department of Education.
Please announce soon you will vote No on DeVos so others will be encouraged to do the same. (I am a WA constituent of yours.)
I am so proud to have you represent my state and our country.  Please stand behind your convictions and vote NO #DeVos
questions like what ? Like how much do democrats get from unions while children have bad teachers that cant be fired
'Parents and children' rights are mutually exclusive with one size fits none federal education programs.U ever make it out of Seattle & DC?
People keep saying "call your Senators" and I keep saying mine are already doing all the work!  Thank you
The main unanswered question is that Is she qualified? Hell NO.
@MariaCantwell So please do not let them approve her.  My grandkids are counting on you.  We demand to see his taxes!!!
Your kind would complain it it were Mother Teressa!
thank you Senator Murray'
Thank you, Senator Murray.
Like....does she know anything about education?
DO NOT APPROVE!  Tillerson was enough. I live in Seattle & I vote.
Yea @PattyMurray !
thank you, Senator Murray!
but what are we going to do about it?
all senators should vote 'no,' this woman is definition of buying one's seat. No experience in public ed. Not even attending.
Thanks from Seattle, Patty!
So are you going to vote no? Or are Dems going to continue to just confirm wildly unqualified lunatics? Sessions? No, right?
deny deny deny!
omg what channel! Lord did I miss it!  I waited all week for this
I think they can find a more knowledgeable candidate.
that's a polite way to put it.
Thank you for your continued fight for America's kids!
Thank you and please DO NOT CONFIRM!
please tell us how to stop this, she is the worst possible pick for our children and their teachers! & I've called my senator!
Vote No on DeVos. Choice means segregation by race/ religion/ income. Schools shouldn't be for-profit; should be to educate.
THANK YOU PATTY! STAND STRONG!
And the answered questions are just just bad, esp regarding #disability education. Do not confirm!
Thank you, Senator! Please keep it up!
Definitely. She needs to be able to answer questions about current education and thoughtful answers for the future of our kids.
agree deny please
