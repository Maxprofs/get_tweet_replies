50 Senators will vote to reject Betsy DeVos. Just one more Republican needs to stand with parents, teachers & students & vote NO. #NoOnDeVos
.@PattyMurray @schemaly You were great at the #DumlDevos rally yesterday, Senator. Keep up the great work!!
Obviously, Karen could care less abt kids; but, hey… she believes in murdering children! ABORTIONS!
The irony is just too much
Easier to ignore the gobshites & eejits. Life's too short for abusive ignorance.
Thanks 4 ur wonderful contributions to humanity w great malice!
By the way @realDonaldTrump is ur President & u couldn't  #MAGA
Why are you still typing? Go away.
thank you senator for standing up against devos! we love yr support!
,LIAR
We need @SenateGOP  especially Texas senators @JohnCornyn & @tedcruz to ignore party line and do whats right. NO Devos
Ted not sure about him but hoping @YarosisNancy @hardcorerox @vezzolini 
I have no faith in either :(
He is traitor 
is almost impossible to get in touch with. What are "constituents" anyway @MesMitch
You know  Feb. 21st is the Date #SCOTUS Will Decide Whether Trump is a REAL President or if we Need a #NewElection 
I wonder if they so anything. I hope so. What's the plan if a new election is deemed necessary
Dems will keep blocking Scotus nominee and this case is our only hope right now that will save us from Hitler 
The death-grip of unions upon American Education is over.  Inner City parents now have hope for their children. I'm with Betsy
what's your solution? In my book, of democrats say no then I say yes. Time to end the democrat party.
Why?  Hillary Clinton was selling your kids according to your Mena report.  How possibly can they stand with anyone in NV?
Senator. I understand your objection to DeVos   But I see no alternate proposal. Our schools continue to degrade. Solution?
AHA WE GOT HER MAYBE OUR KIDS WILL HAVE A FUTURE AFTER ALL
You don't stand with us!
How did that work out for ya? #MAGA
Im a mom, grandma & school fund raiser for academics. I say vote yes for Devos. Does that count?
guess what it didn't work.
Murray you're a sexist..another excellent female and u go nuclear. Just think you're not far from falling to level of pelosi..
@getwired not a Democrat but you have support from me too
Disgusting and Dangerous! Not 1 Democrat with a brain, all little duckies following the Hate filled leaders! Pathetic!
- Instead of dividing America why don't you find a way to work with DeVos? There has to be some good in the plan Look for that.
Good for you. Status quo of crappy schools keep the slaves to ignorant to question those in power. You obviously do want that.
@ActualEPAFacts too bad it didn't work. Now we have more proof you can buy your way through the US government
,  I don't think so senator.
The age of keeping the poor dependent on government is coming to an end. Shame on you and the DNC.
she will be great wait and see.
Thank you for all you are doing for our children, for our teachers, for our schools and for our country!
And, you are just like the rest of your half-wits! IGNORANT & IRRELEVANT!

#WeThePeopleMAGA Not… the LEFT anymore!
On what grounds would any Senator vote FOR her!? She is clearly ill-equipped, and morally lacking for such a post.
the grounds=suitcases full of cash
Funny. And Infuriating.
sad but horribly true
children don't count. They don't vote or contribute to campaigns
funny you would bring up campaign contributions arguing against a candidate that took very few $$ himself.
Who brought up campaign contributions?
Too bad you didn't stand w/ your constituents when @BernieSanders wanted to get them inexpensive pharmaceuticals.
True. But on THIS issue she's taking the right stand.
always room for improvement, I say that about even Bernie
.@adjestil01 @412V70 @djwoolverton He isn't a Communist, many people care about it, and you sound like a parody of a Southern-fried cracker.
Socialism anf communism is not the same 
This is my Senator I will never vote for again.
why? What are you all hiding behind the secretary of Education
I hope every single Democrat picks up where Sen. #Warren left off & read Corretta Scott King's letter re #Sessions & his past.
Because, obviously, the constituents who voted for you don't know any better. #BetsyDeVos #MAGA
nice to know you support lining union pockets vs taking care of children
Why r u trying to keep the poor & minorities from getting the same education as your kids? R u better than us?
gaurantee your constituants with children hate you
thank you for your efforts. #justsaynotofacism
ha ha ha losers .!!

Liberal meltdown! The product of liberal indoctrination! #Snowflakes #MAGA 
@BlueHumanity wish there was one decent fella in the @GOP, but no that would be too much like RIGHT!!! Thanks for NO!!
They're Constituents won't be in office very much longer, AMERICA is awake and lining up to Vote em OUT.
We will finish what we started Last Nov 8th voting Dems out every two years until you can only be found in history books.
By constituents you mean Teacher's Unions @ the expense of ur real constituents, poor youths trapped in failing public schools
@WhatWillKnows THANK YOU PATTY!
yay!! You nutjobs lose again. #maga
CONFIRMED. Move along and try to disrupt our great country another way.
Keep doing what doesn't work as long as it benefits the teachers union. God forbid we put kids first!
thank you for trying to protect our children. I am both shocked and saddened that the GOP put their party before our children.
Thank you Senator for fighting for us !!
Hey, how did that work out for ya? It IS the year of the (conservative) woman. Be happy, Girl Power is happening!
How did that work out for ya?
#cheese4yourwhine
@RGCleaningServ para que tanto bla bla bla  si los nominados. ya estan listos para serle fiel a quien  los nomino
when you side with the unions over the best for children you shouldn't be in the position your in #justquit #kidsfuturesmatter
you must really hate your state!


we needed America to "stand-up" in November! He told us what his plans were. We are doomed!
yes because that has worked so well for your party lately
Not all your constituents want the status quo. It's time for new thinking on how to educate! It's been screwed up so far!
@Karoli Wish Reps would have stood for their constituents like @SenatorCollins.
@SenJohnMcCain @MitchMcConell @SenatorGraham
way to be independent thinkers
Fail
no wonder
You only represent one side of your constituents. Some of us are for a change to the system.
I BELIEVE, I BELIEVE not!
Honey, the second her policies turn schools around, Dems are toast. Your policies don't work &we now have a Govt 2 prove that
:shame on you. You vote for the teachers Unions and ignore the plight of the inner city kids. Senator: YOU are part of the swamp
Keep fighting the good fight!
hope you are out this year
- Pattycake Pattycake baker's cupcake!! Another one from the Senate's  Basket of Despicables!! You r wasting ur breath!!

Unfortunatelly religious zealot Pence cast his vote and we have most dangerous woman deciding about our kids edu

So sad Pence did it Pay for play has won
So.... How'd that all work out fer 'ya?  #BetsyDeVos
Like you oppose freedom.
game ovet

that is why Democrats can't win anymore, born to lose!!!
Americas children need change! most of these kids suck now.
You will still get your cut of the bribe money from Teachers Unions. 

#MAGA 
#WeThePeople 
and favoring teacher unions bc, well, they've done such great job with public schools, right? Libs have hatred in their hearts.
Thank you Dems for your valient effort against the GOP steamroller. We will primary
TY Senator.

CONFIRMED You & the Unions loose!!!   #MAGA #AMERICAFirst #devos
How'd that work for you Pats.  Lol.   #Pence!
ROCK ON. Stay Strong. You are the voice of our America. Our Kids. #NoonDeVos
Yay Patty. Way 2 show model bi-partisanship. U r part of the problem, not the solution. Keep this up and Dems will lose again.
- the Dem Party has been a complete screwup for decades. Get out of the way. We're tired of your incompetence.
So this gives me another reason to thank G-d for Republicans = sanity. #YesonDevos
do your constituents know you value Union officials wants over Parent's choice ?   #MAGA
Sit down senator
Shame on you. A corrupt Union who cares nothing about our kids.  This is OUR money that pays for the schools
US kids score lowest in Math&science.yet score HIGH in self esteem.LIB EDU guidelines are NOT working.stop taking NEA union $$$
While Obama was in office, the world laughed at America. Now they just laugh at the libetards. You're only hurting yourselves.
And voting to keep with the status quo of the downslide of American public education.
to be absolutely fair, you're standing with your liberal supporters. and that's fine. just don't lump us all in with this.
Racist @PattyMurray taking choice away from minorities.
#Racism
@RiseUpAbove What's disning is DJT's disregard for education by noming such a person as DeVos! You can have education-ho hum!
1/do u think its ok that Teachers are passing their adult fears of someone running for Pres to children? To kids marching and
2/not knowing why? Do u think its ok that there are currently no policies that charter schools have to follow an actual program
3/and dont have to buy educational books from McGraw, and that any1 with a degree can be hired instead of ppl in education?
4/do u think its normal that all the walk on the street shows prove Americans dont know history because our education system
5/didnt teach them? If u are going to fight, fight for the real wrong things...which none of u mention, just an obvious
6/party game which is a disgrace to the children of this country.
your Republican counterparts are going to have an interesting trip home. #DeVosvote 
It's a shame they are afraid of Donnie.
good, need to do same with GOP SC nom.
Yes! Thank you @SenateDems ! Now who are the heroes going to be from @SenateGOP besides @lisamurkowski and @SenatorCollins ?
thank you!
Thank you!!
thanks, Senator Murray!
thank you!! @SenateDems we see you fighting we are with you!!!!
Your plan is to keep our children ignorant and subservient.  You REAL job is to keep them Safe and Free.  You are a leach.
Then you stand for a failed system. #SchoolChoice and #RightToWork for the Teachers is the answer. #confirmBetsyDeVos
you are "standing" for  #NEA b/c they make huge donations to your political campaigns & that matters more to you than children!
It's odd you will speak in WA DC. and yet back in WA state our school are suffering due to WA State choosing to underfund.
Thank you from Colorado!
It's because the public school teachers want to keep their cash cow. Kids can't read or count change back at a cash register!
You don't represent me in Washington you are pathetic obstructionist that needs to resign!!
u are ruining our children's lives patty!!
@spadafarm Who will be the non-fascist Republican to step forward and kill this appointment?
that's right! You tell those blacks to stay in those failing schools. You're there to hinder not help! #NoOnDeVos  #NoonDeVos
I agree. @PattyMurray
BUH-BYE PENCE IS ENROUTE TO PISS IN YOUR CHEERIOS!!!
Heil Patty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The Keep Kids In Failed Schools Union Puppet Shill in Tennis Shoes. Traded her soul for corrupt union donations
Teachers union is one of Dems largest donors So of coarse!
The truth, you are standing with teachers union that line your pockets. Poor kids deserve choice too, STOP IT.
we respect your right to speak for unions unfortunately you're not speaking for the children #PublicSchoolsHaveFailed

you're not standing WITH anyone. Just against trump because hate.
@SenJohnMcCain
This is the most frightening thing about this whole charade. Absolutely no senate check on Bannon and crew. https://twitter.com/SenFranken/status/828975579395477504 …
Devos just wants to have the same education as elites.  Shame on u for selling out our children.
no you are beholden to the teachers union. that's all that your vote is about.
I'm one of your constituents and fully opposed you. Go Devos! #MAGA
so u're against innerCity kids having a choice to attend a better sch so teacher's unions will keep giving $ 2dems?
Shameful
You say thousands have called to protest, you didn't tell them HUNDREDS of thousands are supporting her!
They are protesting because of lies in the media from people like you. They are getting a BAD education now but fight change
@girlsreallyrule Can't DeVos get the message? She is NOT WANTED! If your big brother has to bend arms to get you in, stay home.
Sen Murray made excuses for Usama Bin Laden ..there you go, folks...a Democrat
Thank you! Please reach across the aisle and get a smart Republican's support!
Wouldn't it be nice if democrats cared about vetting potential terrorists entering the US as much as they do Trump's cabinet?
how are your kids/grandkids doing? Mine R FAILING reading & math. Need CHOICE/REFORM &someone can't be BOUGHT!!
They better
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Betsy DeVos The School Children
Have A Fitting Message For You!
RESISTANCE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Wrong! Every single Democratic will be standing with the teacher's union. Good for the unions - not so good for our kids!
50 - 51 Dems suck. Maybe fix your own party before trying to destroy other.
this is absolute hogwash you are only standing for your constituents that agree with you, I am not one of them RETIRE NOW #tcot
One question? Did your kids go to Public school?
thank you!
NO to DeVos!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@USAjobs2017 @nytimes DeVos reminds me of the separate but equal school lie I grew up in.  No to that rabbit hole.
Standing up against school choice for inner city schools is racism again by the party of slavery. You're fired.
And ...It still wont work ..@POTUS will get Nancy as well as every one of his cabinet selections ..#MakeAmericaGreatAgain
