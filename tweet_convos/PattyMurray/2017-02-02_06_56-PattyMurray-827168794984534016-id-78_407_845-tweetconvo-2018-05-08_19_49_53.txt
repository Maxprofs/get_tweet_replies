@SenateDems @valeriestrauss DeVos is NOT qualified!
DeVos will profit from unproven spec ed "therapies" and does not understand IDEA
That's not really how it works.
Thise with disabilities do not deserve FAPE? My kids are dyslexic, not disruptive
The people do not want her in charge of our kids futures. Thank you Senator Murray for fighting
You are welcome to homeschool your kids if you hate pub ed. My tax $ should not go to religious ed
Except there's no Constitutional Amendment barring teaching kids about science
It also prohibits govt establishment of religion. Would u be ok w/ tax funding an Islamic school?

I am a college professor. You're not telling me anything I do not know. But DeVos is NOT the answer!
Great condemnation & promise to vote NO. Oh, wait. You didn't do that. Stay soft, Senator. It'll make you easier to primary.
She is still chasing the bears out of the "classroom".
she never could answer a question for you. You are to bigoted.
Intresting, you actually showed to ask questions. How adult of you
Watching your ABC segment that you will hold the floor to block DeVos.  Can't thank you enough or send enough love. #nodevos
YOUR DAYS OF CORRUPTION COMMUNISTS AND PROGRESSIVES IS ENDING.  VJ DAY IS COMING FOR AMERICANS
and you're surprised about it? She plagiarized answers trying to sound smart. #HellNoOnDeVos
and the public schools are in a real mess-look at Federal Way, Auburn, Tacoma etc=going down and it is sad-
She looks like a deer caught in the headlights.  She knows nothing about public educations.
she cannot answer questions due to lack of ability.
I'm still wondering why we voted against bernies drug bill
@SenateDems @washingtonpost not did the other make fuktards that where pushed through! SOB this whole thing is a sham
@SenateDems @washingtonpost What does that prove?! You can just create a endless stream of questions!
She wont answer questions because she was officially approved years ago by donating $millions$ to GOP. CROOKED.
tough, get over it, move on!
Charter Schools bill of goods. DeVos is sold on this deception and obfuscation by paid analysts @SenateDems @SenateGOP
@SenateDems @washingtonpost thank you senator Murray #resist #SwampCabinet
I'm so glad you asked her about PSLF. Please keep fighting for those of us who are counting on this program. #DumpDeVos
@SenateDems we will lose our education system read and research this Oligarch
Must reject based on total lack of qualifications!
Because she is incapable of a cogent response.
probably because she lacks the education to answer any sort of exam properly
DeVoss could be Mother Theresa and you would continue to yield to failed school cultural totalitarianism
@SenateDems @washingtonpost She's a glorified room mother w money who brings great snacks when it's your kids day to bring them
@SenateDems @washingtonpost Thank you Senator. DeVos isn't anywhere close to what we need in public education. We must reject.
Dem politicians don't want answers. They want money, power, and divisiveness like for-profit Millionaire Murray
@SenateDems @washingtonpost no trump nominee will be good enough for you clowns unless he nominates a lefty. GET OVER IT
The Dems sent her 25 TIMES the questions as they did her predecessor. Screw them!
That's because no answer will ever be good enough. Democrats are obstructionists to Trump.
and the answers she provided weren't even hers!
@SenateDems @washingtonpost Patty, work those channels. Tell Toomey America's children need a qualified leader, not DeVos.
@SenateDems @washingtonpost please put our children first they are our future and our number one national treasure.
@SenateDems @washingtonpost get real! Your protecting your teachers union money.
@SenateDems @washingtonpost it can be difficult to explain how your planning to rip off the system
@SenateDems @washingtonpost and senate is doing what they want

@SenateDems @washingtonpost she can't she is too under-qualified! As a retired educator people should be scared!
quit drinking the koolaide, I'd go to the bank on this one.
well to answer questions You Senators Must be in the Chamber to Work @senFeinstein @corybooker
@SenateDems @washingtonpost Fascists never do especially ones who are Traitors Putin will pump her up and supply her with lies
are you sure she ever truly understood the questions?
@SenateDems @washingtonpost keep up the good fight! DeVos is unfit! Thank you Patty Murray!
@MattMurph24 And "guns everywhere" will not help her charter schools, because they will encourage parents to home school.
- What can she say - DeVos role would be to gut public education for benefit of for-profit & private schools.
@SenatorSessions said he wouldn't participate in votes while up for his own appointment. Hold him to it!
Not to mention the plagiarism, lack of experience, stark religious views, lack of knowledge, failures of previous charters,etc
WAPO article w/Murray, 2/3's of the 3 Stooges. Biased reporting w/ pandering statements. #CrazyStuff
Thank you for the work to keep our country from becoming a theocracy.
You patty are suppose to be working FOR THE PEOPLE! Get with the program! YOU ARE 'NOT' MY SENATOR!!!!!!!!
@neeratanden @washingtonpost And Republicans will approve her anyway.
keep pushing on the cabinet nominee's and against a process that goes ahead w/o all participants.
I have an all-level teaching cert in TX.  I listened to the questions.  She's ignorant of Ed policies/law in U.S.
NO DEVOS NO DEVOS NO DEVOS
Senator Murray, DeVos cannot and should not be approved. Thanks
Betsy DeVos should not be confirmed!
@neeratanden @washingtonpost How can we expect anything else when the titular head is hollowness personified
@neeratanden @washingtonpost what makes you think she will? Devos and her ilk bought the congress they wanted.
@neeratanden @washingtonpost Please vote no! She's an abomination!
@neeratanden @washingtonpost then just say no!
Crucial she is not confirmed. Keep up the resistance.
so this is your your brand of "extreme vetting" ???
Talk to @SenToomey please.
Repubs need to stop drinking the #koolaid. She can do good somewhere else, not as Sec of Ed. #votenodevos
She is working on her plagiarized response, it takes a while to research good works from the Obama Administration.
Obama had the best words. Unlike failure Donald Trump. Totally inarticulate. SAD!
