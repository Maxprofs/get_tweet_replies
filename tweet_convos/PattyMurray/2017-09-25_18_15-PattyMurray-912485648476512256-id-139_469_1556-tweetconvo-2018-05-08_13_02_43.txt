*cough* single payer *cough*. Sorry, seasonal allergies. I should see a doctor.
At this point all I care about is not going bankrupt if I get seriously ill.
If you really think Government controlled health care is good just check out the VA health care!
Good health is the way to drive healthcare costs down. Chronic & acute medical is extremely costly.
And Taking Profit Out Of Healthcare; Lobbyist, Political Campaign Finance, Insurance Companies, PAC Money, Ad Campaigns, will save Billions.
I just wish every American realizes,  
Not everything that is profitable is of social value & not everything of social value is profitable.
Exactly, improve the quality of life for all our people. Take the politics out of it. We are all going to get sick at some point and die.
It's time for you to throw in the towel and retire.
Have you given your plan to Congress or is this all speed and b
single payer please!
Obamacare - Insurers are quitting, healthcare is going backwards.   Maybe you had your head in the sand or only see what you want to.
Open up the state lines!! We do not want single payer or any other government controlled health care. You guys struggle to tie your shoes!!
To bad you didn't have the Spine to stand up against O'Kenyan Care, #DraintheSwamp
A bipartisan compromise can be reached making Obamacare better .The main obstacle is the Koch Republicans.Stating the obvious.Sorry.
Please support/sponsor Medicare for All @PattyMurray
Work together on Trumpcare & make it great! Let OCare go, its corrupt & raised rates on seniors.

AWESOME PROPOSAL!
past failed obamacare?
Thank you @PattyMurray
Move on to "Repair and Renew" Obamacare.
Where is it in the constitution?
Small details she probably hasn't read the constitution either
It's time for you to endorse #Medicare4All, senator.
Uhm no, NO and hell NOOOOoooooo
Maybe the doctors who spent yrs in college and have to payback student loans should profit!!
Thank you for speaking for the people of the US.
Not the smart ones or anyone who's actually read the constitution
Thank you for continuing to call for a bipartisan solution. #WAVoter
If they had listened to Republicans n the first place we wouldn't be in this mess
If and only if the plan is for the three branches of government as well.
Give us your health care plan. 

Oh, no? Why not? 

Because you don't want healthy Americans, you're liars and knaves.

#TheIllAreDestroyed
Already done Sen Murray. We are waiting for great things!!
Thank you Senator Murray!
We're already 20 trillion in debt. Country will go bankrupt with one payer.
Never!!!  I will never become a puppet of the socialist/arrogant/political class you tout. Slavery under a different name!  Never!
Support single payer cathy.
....getting sick of calling your office and saying this, but until you listen to the People, #SinglePayerNow  #GigiForSenate
blah, blah, single healthcare system, blah, blah, don't care about the working class, blah, blah, no premium relief
I could not agree more Senator Murry/ drop the "politicization" of Healthcare reform
Thank you Senator!
Thanx for the hard work on healthcare. But, what about Puerto Rico? Death and bad health will result if help is not given soon.
Recovery is going to take time and it being an island makes it harder.
However, helping is an American value:

Thank you for thinking of the people.
Healthcare for everyone at an affordable price is not hard to achieve
Thank you for your bipartisan efforts on healthcare.  Vote no on the Graham-Cassidy.  Let the Senate work like it used to.
Is there any word on Sanders' bill for medicare for all?
I called and asked @PattyMurray office yesterday, she "doesn't have enough info" to decide on it; get with it, Senator #SinglePayer
So republicans should suck up to democrats when absolutely no republicans were allowed to attend or input on Obamacare. Washington state nut
#Washingtonians keep voting in this doofus @SenateDems but then @chuckschumer & the test aren't better-Tax payers r losers here
It is rich that you Democrats are now preaching about high premiums when it's your fault. DRAIN THE SWAMP @reaDonaldTrump #MAGA
As usual you talk and do nothing
Sad to hear a republican congressman blaming DEMS not helping to fix Obamacare..#SILLY
thank you, senator Murray!
InsuranceCare does not equal actual healthcare. Stop hurting Americans and repeal and replace the ACA. Stop the insanity! #HealthCareDebate
please tell how this new GOP plan will help Americans...................................
Lets see your healthcare is perfect & free thanks to the taxpayers. Our healthcare is out of control cost is there something wrong here?
Proud to be your constituent. You and Maria Cantwell do us proud
Especially true in Medicaid expansion states like IN & OH. Current TrumpCare would screw those states.
I'm very disappointed with the actions of Congress and the Senate
Condemn single payer as a first step
Love you Patty!
Yes, thank you @PattyMurray #shepersisted
It looks like it is time for u to drop about 40.
Democrats lied to us. Can't keep plan can't keep doctor didn't save $2500.  Meanwhile Obamacare implodes lies lies lies
Until the next time they sabotage your efforts...haven't you learned by now that with Repubs you need it in writing and preferably in blood!
Maybe work on stopping the nuclear war first? STAND UP ALREADY.
Let women take over. Women are smarter and more compassionate. They would at least think it through!
All Udo is Pander/Play Politics! AreU on the SameInsurancePolicy We're on? While Ustuff your pockets #RealHardWorkingFamilies #Pay4Benifits
More #PigeonFood4ThePigeons -Personally I see much better than I hear;-) Remember it's U & Your Party Failed Policies thats gotten this mess
I have ideas on how to get more people insured under the ACA, eliminate the penalties for people not buying insurance, and help employers.
No more damn repeal attempts. This is insane and incredibly insulting to the American People. Fix Health Care properly...now!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump it's time!
@SenAlexander Back to work. Together. Fix this together. @PattyMurray
"It's time we drop Trumpcare once & 4 all, [throw the GOP death panel out], & work to move health care forward.
Where's your #Resistance bullshit POLITIC PATTY...YOU''RE THE PROBLEM!!!!
Will be happy to support any challenger to your seat that supports #SinglePayer
@FergusGigi is running for that seat #GigiForUs #GigiForSenate
It's really time for the tail to stop wagging the dog...most Americans want good healthcare. Rs please stop this repeal crap & just fix it!
Support single payer!
@FergusGigi supports #SinglePayer #GigiForUs #GigiForSenate #Gigi2018
Maria Cantwell is thinking about cosponsoring single payer healthcare. Call her office at 425-303-0114 and urge her to stand with Bernie.
Do U mean like the ACA? It's broke and U know it! You don't want to fix, you want single payer so gov controls our lives. Stop lying to us.

Just spoke w/ fmr Gov @luisfortuno51: “PR on brink of humanitarian disaster." USVI too. DC must put aside controversies, prioritize rescue.
It's past time, but I don't trust that it will happen as long as we have a Republican majority in both houses.

How do you move a failed #healthcare act forward?
It's time we dump Obamacare and you ignorant Dems stop obstructing and work together to fix this disaster that you forced thru!
Fact: The middle class is paying for all these legal and illegal immigrants Obamacare!
Thank you @PattyMurray! Keep fighting the good fight against the insanity.
I pay $800 per month for my health insurance.  I am now paying a$6,500 hospital bill for 2 surgeries because of deductible. You FAILED!
How does saving the lives of 25K seniors a year a fail?how is my grandson >27 now paying $25 a mo instead of $1400 a mo a fail?
Agreed!

If you can get insurance companies to lower prices so poor can afford it, great. That's not what you engineered though. #HealthCareDebate
Where you been all these years? All of a sudden you want to work on health care? What is  your plan if Trumpcare is defeated?
When did we pick up "Trump care" ? Last I checked I still un- constitutionally have to buy insurance I can't afford to use
“Work together”....have you tried to “work together” on this or any other bill?
Let's just keep the shitty Dem healthcare that was created. Them Dems need to chew on shit just a little bit longer!
Someone actually working across the aisle to get ACA to work
First you recommend all Congress be put under Obama care then change.
Why aren’t you and your criminal colleagues in the legislature not on ACA? You are one of the biggest hypocrites!!! LIARS, all of you!!!
Thank you, Senator.
For bankrupting the country?
Yes #MedicareForAll is the best option and would cost less than ACA.
from the same genius who gave us Obamacare? "The only folks qualified to fix the broken system is the people who broke it" 
Thank you Senator.  Your steadfast determination to find good, bipartisan solutions is an example of how to govern.  #womenwhoinspire
You can't come to the table and NOT make concessions! Trying to put Obamacare off on Republicans isn't going to fool anyone. Get to work!
Thank you 4  URthoughtful, bipartisan leadership to bring great healthcare to Americans #PeopleOverParty #KeepUpTheFight #saveourhealthcare
Hmmm, you weren’t all about bipartisanship when Barry was in charge. Why the change?
You mean drop Obamacare
#NoTrumpcare #NoToGrahamCassidy
Quit stalling and acting like you care. You are covered with govt pension and other non govt pensions or personal wealth.
Embarrassing, 25 years in the Senate, ACA passing on partisan lines, yet think piecemeal "bipartisan" efforts will move healthcare forward?
YOU are not even on Obamacare! You would not be able to afford to go to a doctor after paying for your premiums let alone the deductible.
Thank you Patty for representing our best interests in WA State.
Patty I think you know what a rip off Obamacare is to budget-I think you  know how the FDA has been poisoning us for years & making us sick.
Pharma swoops in and makes billions off sick. I'm telling you I am sick of you and the rest of politicians lying to us-acting criminally.
Sorry you had your chance
Bernie's bill. Half the cost, better outcomes.
@FergusGigi backs #SinglePayer , and we won't have to remind her to do her job #GigiForUs #GigiForSenate
What is your health care plan like?  Lets move it forward  to someone who deserves it!  Do you not have enough money to get your own?
I wouldn't be too optimistic about bipartisan fixes. The GOP has been extremely clear that healthcare is a commodity and not a public svc
This bill will not go away. It's offspring are going to keep popping up until we run these clowns out of office.

VIDEO: People in line yell "SHAME! SHAME! SHAME! SHAME!" as @LindseyGrahamSC walks into the hearing for his health care bill: 
Foreward ?.....resistance and obstruction dont move at all.
Bet your plan is better than this garbage

NEW: CBO confirms that Trump's new plan takes 32 million people off their insurance 

But they still want to do it

In May Trump said health insurance costs $15 per month. Yesterday he said $12 per year. He deserves credit for slashing premiums by 93%!
We did not ask you to do this. We asked that this GOP repeal be KILLED NOW.We don't want you playing bipartisan games with them right now

I still can't get over Trump's incoherence in suggesting that HEALTH INSURANCE costs $12/YEAR because HE KNOWS NOTHING! @Lawrence 
Thank you @PattyMurray If #BadAss WomenDC  made a bipartisan effort, there is no doubt you could compromise and make improvements to ACA
Thank you
