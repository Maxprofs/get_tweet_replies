@anitalhdz Given what I saw happen in the hearings, I am not surprised. She knows nothing about public schools at all.
"thank you" feels so inadequate to type.....but I for one, am sincerely grateful............for your stance
no to DeVos, Pruitt,Tillerson, i'm your constituent
Please save us from her Senator Murray.
oh dern. Dont show @WalshFreedom this, hes ranting and raving about school choice.
she is a terrible choice.wants guns in schools 2 protect against grizzlies? Jeeeeez
She brings up Trump talking about grabbing pussy. But was dead silent of Billy raping women
I speak from bitter experience. We returned to the public school system in the niche of time, and my kiddo thrives
@MerileeParis Why would u bad mouth her on social media.Look at the stats on how refugees have overtaken the area.Figure it out
The problem in Detroit is not immigration, it's failing charter schools.DeVos eschews academic rigor & accountability.
@AnnTruwe The true GOP agenda. Keep Americans stupid so they can rape, pillage & loot our rights, our dignity & country.
I hope you plan to boycott the inauguration. 
Thanks Patty
@EndHateRadio WA voted narrowly to approve charter schools the yr I arrived. Look now at MI. A glimpse in2 WA's future.
She destroyed the educational system in Michigan so now we put her in charge of the whole country! No thanks!
thank you for your hard work and dedication, from Illinois
@PrincessBravato but that's what they want. A dumbed down electorate is easy to manipulate.
@ABCPolitics @CBSNews @NBCNews @WRAL @newsobserver - recommendation for thoughtful coverage of critical issues...sic 'm  MSM!
@Kat4Obama let's not forget she cared more about big $$ then educating kids ! She's just another HEARTLESS GREEDY RW'R #VoteNo
Charter schools are in it for the money. Period. They marginalize special ed, cram in as many kids as they can.
And lower number of licensed educators on staff.
YOU are a hypocrite!! YOU HAVE INVESTED AND TRIPLED YOUR WEALTH AS A SENATOR! Also, the schools in Michigan are also YOUR care.
You are assuming that they really care.....they don't.....all about the bottom line....making money....the goal...
Vote NO on this woman.
People say they wanted Trump to run the country like a business. She bombed her job so she gets huuge promotion. NOPE.
@dhfull50 #AMEN!!!
Schools are the heart of America and she wants to totally destroy them. Inexcusable that she even gets a hearing.
Practice Math with http://FinallyUnderstand.com   @DegaSuper @PattyMurray @grammasheri
@ssandee51 please fight for our public education system, especially in Washington state. Thanks Senator! #TheResistance
Senator, what's ur opinion on Michelle Rhee? Would she have been a better choice?
we cannot allow her to lead our Ed Dept. Please do what you can.
@SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump @MikePenceVP @michellemalkin What about scores of charter schools-up or down? #TX
@ChuckWendig it's not about education it's about ideology
They hire marginal teachers, say they're people with real-world experience. Pedagogy matters. They fail on safety.
You should not be in office.
Thank you for your leadership on the hearing today. I appreciate you!
Oh I'm sure that isn't true.  The list of Democrat's lies continues to grow as the party's ranks continue to diminish!
Are you seriously claiming that federal policy for inner city schools was successful? #ToUglyToLookInTheMirror
I find it comical how Devos is being grilled by Dems when(under the Dem party)we are at the bottom of the world EDU list!!
Thank you for fighting for our children and for my career as a public educator.
IF you got to ask another question. maybe ask her about kids on the spectrum and how to educate them in public ed.
And #Michigan schools get segregated
DeVos is DREADFUL. Please get all dems to vote NO. She failed every question, not proficient, NO accountability. #BetsyDeVos
We cannot have this happen to our schools and our children. #OpposeDeVos
Didn't you vote this week to keep Americans from buying Canadian drugs and fuck over your constituents? #TermLimits
Parents of students want a full transparent hearing.  One round of q's is not enough.  This is a very impor. position. Please!
Ms DeVos, public school teacher ps sacrifice time & their own $ in dedication to students. How will you support them?
Teachers are not for a single federal policy pushed on them like Murray would support (betraying East WA). Teacher unions might be.
Thank you for your hard hitting questioning tonight.
great job today 
don't obstruct! Do you're jobs! Work with @realDonaldTrump
Thank you for sharing truth & not letting donors buy your votes
- So, mission accomplished?

#DeVos admits to buying influence w/ contributions to GOP—even some voting on confirmation. Is this why hearing is limited to 1 round of Qs? 
...and hurt kids, educators, public schools.
If our education system(or lack of) had anything to do with little Donald getting elected, maybe we need tons of change!
she is *cancer* for public education. Please block her confirmation!
