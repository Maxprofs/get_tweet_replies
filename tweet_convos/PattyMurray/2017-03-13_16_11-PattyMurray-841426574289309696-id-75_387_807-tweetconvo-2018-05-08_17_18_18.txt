Trump is a man of broken promises.
@SenateDems TELL THE DAM TRUTH. PPL WILL HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE BUT YOU PAY FOR IT.  UNLIKE OBAMACARE WHERE YOU ARE FORCE TO.
People paid for insurance under the ACA. The GOP plan will fine you heavily if you leave ins. and then return.
Yes. Correct. To help pay for HI.. big tax cut. There is help for ppl with little income.
The GOP fine exists to prevent people from discontinuing coverage. It's the mandate by another name.
@SenateDems Any solutions from Dems? How r u wrking 4 the ppl? Complaints don't resolve our issues. This your mess.
*off
@SenateDems that was the point good thing the #WeakDem #StrongRepublican strategy works out well for the #oligarchy
Keep fighting for us!
I'm not a fan of Trump or his care, but Obamacare made a lot of patients and families broke. #PotCallingTheKettleBlack
"than under current law". Why do we need a 'law' to insure ourselves?
@SenateDems fine but what are the Dems doing to fix healthcare now? Nothing they are just creating a road block. Terrible
Unlike I can keep my doctor if I like my doctor and premiums will go down for a family of 4? Really?
WA is the only state in the country via @nytimes that will fair well if this thing passes. We implemented ACA to the fullest.
organize for universal healthcare demonstrations
@SenateDems  fox the problem at its root. the electoral system.
Stop supporting the failing ACA. The average premiums for 2017 have increased 25% and health care providers are pulling out.
why do u not have obama care all in public service should have what u give the people right that bill pattu see how that goes
get to work and make sure this doesn't happen.
How long are we going to have to deal with this madness. Maybe we should focus on #impeachment
The failed Obamacare will be part of your poor legacy also.U arepart of the problem in DC, YOU DONT LISTEN !!Vote her out.
@SenateDems yeah and Obama said I could keep my doctor and my plan so who else is lying
impeachment proceedings. When is enough enough!  You know this is like a chess match. All pieces being moved into place.
yet again schoolyard propaganda and whining. Work for us, cross the bridge and do work for us! #StopWhiningPattyMurray
Without any specificity from u, it looks as if ur fearmongering and going negative yet again.  #fakenews.
Americans were paying MORE for health care than any other citizenry BEFORE Obama care. Rank 37th between Costa Rica and Slovenia. Disgrace
@SenateDems That's ok...Had a nasty fall on Friday & Fear leg is broken but since I can't afford ObamaCare I guess I'm SOL.
@SenateDems Obamacare is a threat to American democracy. Leading cause of African American death is abortions promoted by Dems
#ObamaCare is failed and broken system face the facts. Costs sprialing out of control. #fact Tell the truth Patty is it to hard
# no that is obamacare keep ur doctor keep ur plan lies, premiums r high, deductibles high, penalize if u don't have insurance
Trump said "everyone will have insurance" - 24 mill will lose it. You will also be penalized if you leave your plan.
@SenateDems You can keep your Dr. you can keep the insurance you have now,will save you 2,500 a year. That's a broken promise.
How are you going to fix it?
wuuuut she didnt fix obama care why would she lift a finger here
@SenateDems. I'm so sick of the DNC twisting and lying to the America ppl. Keep crying wolf DNC y'all are good at it.
Promises that were made over and over again. Pitiful.
any health care ran by the federal government is enslavement of the people. We should never be dependent on government.
How does it impact MoC and their staff's enrollment in the Small Business Health Option on the D.C. Exchange?
You meant obamacare.
thanks to the #Democratic Party!
@SenateDems Won't the rich get tax breaks? Somebody can claim a promise kept.
@realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan YOU ARE BREAKING YOUR WORD. DO YOU THINK WE DON'T SEE????
RyanCare please,,,it's his baby, not Trumps.
Obamacare is a FORCED GOVERNMENT HEALTH SYSTEM. Obamacare for me was 80% of my monthly income w/ a $8,000.00 ded.
Obamacare is the worse govt. forced crap you dems have ever imposed on the American People.
@POTUS44 THIS BILL MUST BE STOPPED!
@SenateDems It is a broken promise to everyone and a give away to millionaires. The lie of Ryan and Trump continue
Please don't call it trumpcare. #trumpdontcare!
Is it worse than that bill you "didn't" read? ObamaCare? Passed behind closed doors, no Repubs/compromise? #NoCredibility
U should've voted 4 Bernie & we'd B on our way 2 Single Payer. Instead u voted 4 a corporatist. Russia has NOTHING 2 do w/ it.
Speaking of broken promises, weren't u supposed to be representing us ?
Yes but how about the ones who saw their prescriptions double in price to support this false mess Obama made..
Same for O-care... maybe gov should get out of health care & just be our agent to care for the poor?
#TrumpDontCare Thanks for opposing this awful idea
Did u really expect anything else from @SpeakerRyan and his death plan and age tax cut ? He sold himself out to lobbyists
Give trump what he said he would do. Get an Universal Healthcare bill on his desk to sign!
It's not just #Trumpcare. The @GOP wrote it. Maybe #GOPCare, #RepubliCare, or even #Ryancare. Better yet, #Dontcare.
TRUMPcareâ„¢
#TrumpDontCare
A promise not intended to be kept is a lie...
Make no mistake it was no promise. It was just what was said to help get people to vote for them. It was a bald-faced lie.
@RandPaul @Jim_Jordan @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP @SenMajLeader @SenateGOP 
America trusts our @POTUS Trump leadership! #TrumpTrain
At least WE can read it BEFORE they vote
Do you EVER get tired of towing the company line?
