PLEASE, if SCOTUS nom is good approve him. Need to concentrate on stopping Bannon/Trumps rash, chaotic EO's
Sir you are correct. How can we as a Nation go down the path of accepting anything less? The US #Constitution must be defended
Just like Chucky right?

Do ALL u can to oppose, delay, these horrific nominations and Exec orders!! Get tough like Republicans have been!
For non lawyers:

Yates was a politcal appointee, she was disloyal and needed to be canned

based on which high crime or misdemeanor? Don't speak when you're ignorant.
Violating the Emoluments Clause, appointing a Neo-Nazi as chief strategist, 25th ammendment: the list grows.
"Acting Attorney General Yates' loyalty to the Constitution is a betrayal to this administration."
