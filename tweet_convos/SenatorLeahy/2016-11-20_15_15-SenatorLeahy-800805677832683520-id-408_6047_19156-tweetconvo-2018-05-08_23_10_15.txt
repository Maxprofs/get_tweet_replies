Oh man, all these Trump supporters in the replies are something else....
Makes ya wanna find a "safe space"? @JustinTrudeau @POTUS
LOL, nah. I'm able to manage my emotions appropriately. But please keep using blanket statements...
Blankets keep us Warm in Cold Moments.

Long Live Donald J. Trump,
A true Hero of the People
So as long as those people aren't Muslims or Hispanics or blacks or....
WTF? @SmileyGoatZ @JustinTrudeau @POTUS
He is very racist, don't pay attention to him
LOL, this is too funny coming from a person who supports Trump and his racist policies
im looking forward to a real president in the USA, one who is for the people, not their pocket book #TrumpIsComing
Bob you obviously have your eyes closed. How do you think Trump's made his wealth? By ripping off "the people!"
sure sure. This from a guy who likes Saudi oil. Go away and open your own eyes
Yes because fracking is such a brilliant idea for "the people". Nothing bud destroyed land. BTW US still suck on Saudi's tit!
then dave i have the perfect solution, you start, go without oil, if you are willing to do that, no more comments from u
No you first.  Enjoy the rest of your life;)
I don't want or have a desire to give up oil. I enjoy the benefits it has given to modern civilization.
PACK UP YOUR SHIT TRUDY , Rona is Going to Dump your ass Out of the PM Seat If You do Not LISTEN To  The People .
The generation gap could be an obstacle to your interaction with @realDonaldTrump. Canada is a brother to the USA. Remember!!
Dang, I am going to miss him and his family. Hope they come to South Dakota sometime. They can stay with us!
I hear they are heading out west. @JustinTrudeau @POTUS
Well, Would be a dream come true to meet that family! Barack, you know where to find me! :-)
LOL Well, I guess never say never! @JustinTrudeau @POTUS
Gotta have a dream, right?
Sure do! @JustinTrudeau @POTUS
thank you for all you both do.
Two amazing leaders. We love you, guys.
.... gobble gobble!! Your welcome,

Melissa
@PTeach111 @POTUS Goodbye and thank you 
Stop hurting the native American people.
@djbratpack @POTUS BOTH TERRIFIC MALE SPECIES
Interesting how they both are such close friends with George Soros. You know, the Nazi sympathizer.
So long jerks
You're sucking up to the wrong guy, he's a lame duck. I suggest you get on your knees and apologize to Pres. Trump
@gmbutts @POTUS  Globalism, multiculturalism  and political correctness are just fancy names for communism #UnitedNations
the 'Bromance' is over. There's a new POTUS in town and he doesn't like your master Soros.
is Canada still willing to take refugees after yesterday terrorist attack
I could just cry.... can you imagine Trudeau buddying up with Trump like this?
your government promised no more first past the post.
Obama the worst POTUS in history. He has no world vision.
Trump is going to destroy you. Fucking liberal pussy.
lol!
@cafreeland @POTUS  we feel the pain! He indeed was a leader to admire! Pls follow his ways!
Barack doubled  debt. You're well on your way doubling 's. You are just as clueless. SJW PM.
Thanks for using your voices to speak up for love, equality and freedom. *Sounds of Thunderous Applause*
@Wary12 @POTUS   TY too.
it's VERY VERY VERY difficult to go from the AMAZING progress @POTUS @BarackObama's made,to that jackass PEOTUS,truly sad
(@BarackObama) is the BEST President in American History,I'm REALLY gonna miss @FLOTUS and him #ThankYouObama 
asskisser
@yodaquoter @POTUS I wish we could have Justin instead of the misogynistic pig
x2
Time to get those pipelines going. 
Mr. Man!! 
No time to wait we need a better position or we will fail.
@LMoelhauser @POTUS #VoteRecount
@1918champs @POTUS somebody save us please 
now how about fixing what's wrong in canada
RESIGN! You're an embarrassment to Canada.
Best president ever. Will miss the classy 1st family @BarackObama & @MichelleObama 
2017 U.S. standards have lowered.
You are both great people.
President Elect Trump will not be so impressed with your hairdo!
I pity our Prime Minister having to deal with that buffoon in the White House.
I agree! But calling him a buffoon is being too kind.
Such a shame this will be over and u have to deal with a nutjob.
#besties
I thought your big announcement was u r quitting,  then I realized it was just an awesome dream when I woke up! #disappointed
@fourfacesofeve @POTUS 
Thank you Prime Minister Trudeau and President Obama for your tireless efforts to insure freedom!
You are kidding Justin!  Obama is the worst President we've ever had. Says a lot about your insight.
God help us all now. Dark days coming.
@beckyh4dem @POTUS good luck working with the Orange menace.  Maybe you can add CA, OR, WA , NY to Canada?
Harper took offer (#FATCA) he couldn't refuse, but didn't kiss the don't ring - PMJT is kissing that and more. #suckup
*Don's ring...
Now it's a change from two who are affable celebrities but supremely innefective to Godzilla (DT) vs. Bambi. #cdnpoli
Wish we could have him for a 3rd term but the poor man deserves a break!!  #ImWithHer tRump #NotMyPresident
Don't worry Jr, @realDonaldTrump will show you how to be a leader & #MakeCanadaGreatAgain
Only wish our PM could work with President Obama longer...they make an impressive duo!!!!
yeppers Jr, you sure did a crackerjack job building bridges with Trump too didn't ya?
Pray with the US that the next administration doesn’t destroy us all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sbT3_9dJY4 … Don't shoot the Messenger ( Me ) .
So how did your Trump meeting go?
What are you-really?
Obama(w/Clinton) murdered your Dad's friend Qaddafi, armed Al Qaeda-Libya driving 2 million Libyans out as Refugess!
My two favorite world leaders and all-around great humans! Thank you for your leadership!
@mjdwarner @POTUS   
I never had the opportunity to know a Hawaiian named Barry 
I'm heading to Toronto in January. Ohioan.
Just wait for Orange BuffoonHe will undo and ruin everything.
So wrong, so disturbing and Terrified 
#NotMyPresident
@marcylauren @POTUS thank u #justin Now go get sum steel undies 4 when u meet Humpty Trumpster he's an acquired taste
You are a feyn man, and
I'll miss you as commander in chief...
New West, BC
CA
2 bad the US only has a max 2yr term.  Mr. Obama will b gr8ly missed. All the best 2 him 4 the future ahead.
sorry 8 yr term. Typing error.
You're my hero an sooo handsome!!!
Media won't cover news. 7 severe head injuries,  Amputation, 200+ injuries. point blank shots
https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1807153139557190&id=100007875630375 …
It saddens me that this is ending. Two great leaders.
great people! Very proud of both!
Thank you for being  welcoming and working with my president. We will miss him being in office
Please see: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taos_Pueblo …
Might it be possible to restore sacred lands in North Dakota? There is precedent with return of Taos Mtn to Pueblo
If I say; this is an example of TWO #Socialist leaders talking to each other.
I will get Ridiculed!
I am sorry to see you on the same side with #obama who surrendered the middle east to the mad dog #iran
Such a sad time for the world.
Prime Minister of my dreams 
- BO is a smart traitor, while JT is a puppet imbecile
Wonderful two leaders! Glad you both got the change to work with each other !
looser...We want a leader with self worth....and Balls...Big balls..like Trump size. ..
@JLozanoA es una lástima que en México no haya políticos como el primer ministro de Canadá, aquí puro PAN y circo.
2 oblivious p's in a pod
keep slaying, KING, knock them haters out
before it changes hands ... what will it look like next year?
@jorlienne @POTUS Sigh. He's so fiiiiiiiiiiiiiine!
maybe Canada would consider annexing New England?! We'd much prefer you as our new head of state.
the way he screwed Canada over by blocking a pipeline he campaigned 4 because he suddenly discovered fracking? #fail
my two favorite men...at least one stays
Which are now going to be ripped to shreds.
too bad the American Liberal will be gone
so sad out relationship with the US will change drastically on 1/20/17.
If we had relatives closer 2 Canada,  NH & Vermont, that were relocating we would b w/ them already if u would permit
When truth and decency walks though the door.
I'm going to miss President Obama. He gave me #hope
Canadians are sure going to miss the Obamas. :(

Trudeau, Obama & Merkel a a credit 2 the world-sad 2 few great leaders now sad people don't recognize them

Barack, you will be truly missed, and Justin, stop being so adorable! :) :)
times will still change..Trump will try to bully other countries to give US preferential treatment at expense of own
It should be an embarrassment. @JustinTrudeau @POTUS Lethal force was used against #NoDAPL protectors last night.
two rich, good-looking men congratulating themselves for using their power to further enrich themselves.
I'm so sad!
legacies matter! I'm not seeing much coming from the leadership of these two  gentlemen!
It is frankly depressing to see Pres. Obama's term end!  PM, are you being "too patient" with Trump?
dads
Rescue us, Mr. Prime Minister, for the love of Liberal Humanism.
@piperhuguley @POTUS Another bromance I'll miss.
@Maggyw519 @POTUS Obama's time to act is now, & it's rapidly diminishing. His naivety will be the loss of our democracy!
@VetsForObama @POTUS 
@Maggyw519 @POTUS Obama will watch his policies stripped, freedoms curtailed, & our Union become a police state. His Legacy!
@Maggyw519 @POTUS We are not so pleased with POTUS. Obama is allowing Russian subversion of our election. That's his legacy!
Forget about him he is out.  Focus focus focus
thank god this little love affair is at an end!
@kheraldo24 @POTUS no more than ever u need to stand up against US doctrine like your father did
Yeah, well if we allow the Mango Mussolini into office, things are gonna get... difficult @JustinTrudeau. Apologies in advance. @POTUS
.@JustinTrudeau @SaraJBenincasa @POTUS (Please don't leave us with the orange man)
U may need to start building a wall of ur own. I hear lots of my fellow Americans prefer ur gov to our soon to be gov.
are you a politician...a drama teacher...or both? Was that Barack who denied the pipeline ur new BFF! What a joke u r!
I love my President and will miss him and his beautiful family.  Here's to your future
this picture makes me feel good and happy!!!
BS & balderdash. Our countries get along fine, except for the underhanded double dealing Americans & Canadian traitors
YOUR LOVE IS TOO REAL
@TBK365 @POTUS Mr Trudeau we look 2 Ottawa 4a strong hand to intervene&guide us from Trump. This is not a time for politeness
@TBK365 @POTUS Mr Trudeau, we employ you. Please invade USA & install a puppet Govt of Clinton, rightful winner of the people
@noldenmichelle @POTUS sad. When Trump in power, all those wonderful bonds we've made will be broken. Dread the next 4 yrs.:(
#NoDAPL What has been achieved when innocent unarmed protectors are brutalised under your names? #shameful #STOPDAPL
but the next racist president won't be as personable and friendly and funny as Obama
When are you going to stop throwing our money away to other countries and start using it on Canadians who need it the most?

.@JustinTrudeau @a_picazo @POTUS Justin, your father had the perfect hand gesture that you'll probably need to show to Drumpf now & again.
Yup, thanks @POTUS for:
spying on us
drones
big oil subsidies
TPP
punishing whistle blowers
Hillary
universal war
jokes
Two great presidents on one pic.
Enjoy this friendship while you can. Sad to see that it's going to end soon.
@Oshianna2U @POTUS Justin ask the Democrat Pres to stop assaulting First Nation people OVER YOUR DIRTY SHALE OIL #NoDAPL
Cool. Can you now both please get real &very serious about stopping the pipelines & ending fossil fuels #NODAPL thanks

I hope America is the ultimate PSA for countries like Canada. A #NewIronCurtain is descending upon the world. cc @POTUS
I am going to miss this brief and wonderful cooperation between the heads of the two states of which I am citizen 
You're both irrelevant.
//VOM!!!// get a room
Does Trudeau think his love-in with Communist Cuba & Loser Obama will improve relations with Trump admin?
I think @JustinTrudeau's cushy job got a lot harder because @realDonaldTrump doesn't care who he offends much like the >
And thank you Prime Minister for putting race aside 2 acknowledge the goodness of MY @POTUS. #GoodMen
It's been a great pleasure to work with @POTUS - thank you Barack, for working to renew & strengthen the bonds between our countries. 
we don't want it to end, think of how great we could become together
you guys are the best!!
HEIL TRUMP!
A classy guy for sure.
.... Obama .... accomplished nothing absolutely nothing and this is Justins Hero ! OMG :(
I've always thought @JustinTrudeau was a cool dude.But if the former @POTUS ask J.T to go get "pizza & play ping-pong" I'd refuse #pizzagate
Did POTUS tell you he didn't like Mr. Harper or something? #renew? #strengthen #stopthrowingshade
is a class act. @realDonaldTrump has narcissistic personality disorder. Good luck with that.
yes & good luck with the new guy!
@EricShapiro3 @POTUS Could you possibly be a Prime President and govern both us next year?
@DRUMR48 Prime Minister in a few weeks you will be the only sane political leader left in N. America. Bonne chance.
@Chellodello up for a trade? I'll take @POTUS and you can have @JustinTrudeau? He's bilingual & smiles a lot. Has good hair.
it's a deal your PM is dreamy 
@realDonaldTrump
sick beeler 'toon bruh, and that added text really makes it a slam dunk
Oh Canada, how great thou art. We're about to have some serious mood swings. Don't leave us old friend.
@EverythingJDcom @POTUS 
As a nation, we'll miss you.
@GoldieAZ @POTUS and we are sorry we have left you with Trump! 
two of the most useless people in the Americas leading two if the greatest countries on earth. Please help us!
Yes until @realDonaldTrump takes office in January. God Save America January 20 2017.

Obama didnt do a dam thing to help canada, quit worshipping him, its sickening.
Oh how we are all going to miss him
we thank you for your friendship, the next 4 years will sorely test it I'm afraid
DON'T LET THE BROMANCE DIE :"(
Oh, boy, are we ever going to miss him!
@bruins_514 @POTUS  and don't let the door hit you in the ass on your way out !
When R U Stopping The Slaughter Of Seals?
bring Barack to Canada!
@Puglaas @POTUS 
It would be respectful to refer to the AMERICAN President  with dignified formality.
OK  Justin...
my 2 fav politicians & role models
