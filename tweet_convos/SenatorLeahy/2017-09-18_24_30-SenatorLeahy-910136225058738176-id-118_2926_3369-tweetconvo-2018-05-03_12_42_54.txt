Here's a report we did with @FamiliesUSA on veterans + Medicaid.
Don't take healthcare from veterans, they fought for ur freedom & don't take healthcare away from a 20 year CIA brainwashing veteran either!
Medicad should be expanded for all people, call it what you want.
And that would remove the insurance companies from the middle making HUGE profits, while increasing care and saving 4-5k for avg family
Healthcare CEO's make more in 1 day than average US family in an entire year. Some make 5X yearly salary of avg american in 1 day!!
See these are FACTS not Trump bullshit! People like this are in the know.
Called US Capitol. Talk to senator based on entered zip code. Took less than 5 minutes start to finish.DO IT!  202-224-3121.Medicare For All
Deadly choice without conscience. Republicans  clearly do not give a damn about the majority of Americans, shameful.
Amen Brothers!! Graham, Cassidy and ALL other signers-on should be voted out on their next cycle!!

Stop this latest attempt to kill the ACA. Text "resist" to 504-09 to send a message to your Senators. Mine are Cruz & Cornyn. Still did it.
ittta. trumpcare 3. may it go the way of versions 1 and 2.
Preach, @will_c_fischer!
This is unbelievable please tell me how congress pass a bill that will effect ALL AMERICANS without letting us see it This is our lives
FAKE NEWS
Veterans can go to VA for care. Medicaid is for older folks who have no insurance: not for the young who are too lazy to work.
And as best I can tell, he is correct.
it's actually the worse! 32 million uninsured
*worst*
Someone who knows how send this to sen McCain  please do so. if he so worried about the men and women in uniform maybe he can reconsider
@SenJohnMcCain we're appealing to your good sense, sir.
Time to go after the committee members, if they vote for this, they need to resign from @VAChair!  https://www.veterans.senate.gov/about/members

CALL ALL UNDECIDED GOP

Where Republicans stand on Graham-Cassidy @CNNPolitics …
Koch brothers offered large amount of money to GOP to repeal ACA
I want ACA repealed My premiums and deductibles increased!!! it's unaffordable Politicians hate the middle class
IKoch want s to change our constitution to favor Rich at our  expense  GOP talking about constitutional congress now   we will be destitute
You don't need healthcare insurance if you don't seek medical attention. Stay healthy. Eat healthy. Quit whining.
We need bipartisan solutions for Veterans. Applying Deming Solutions to fix broken systems and fund it like the 80s. Fix it.
My daughter was not accepted on the Obomacare package. Makes less than 10 k a year but fined for not having the funds to afford insurance.
GOP needs money. Koch network 'piggy banks' closed until Republicans pass health and tax reform
AMEN!!!! 
Will this change affect you?
Don't forget they vote yes to Mitchell Mcconnell  trumpcare I and they knew it was bad but they voted yes anyway, for the party.
Bullshit you have the va !!!
"And your solution is?
(202) 224-3121
Tell senators vote NO on Graham-Cassidy bill & no using kids as human shields. Don't harm veterans, seniors, disabled.
Amen! This is actually the cruelest version yet. It should have the complete backing of the freedom caucus it's so cruel. Shame on @GOP.
This G-C bill is WORSE than the previous one. Our most vulnerable children and Seniors will suffer.  I hope McCain is the hero again.
For me "GOP" now means
"Greed Over People" party that only fights 4 corporations & elite rich! #TheResistance #ACASavesLives #GrahamCassidy
ACA is a progressive creation to take over the economy ACA is unaffordable for the middle class & working families
Millions not thousands.
MEDICARE FOR ALL!!!
@SenRonJohnson 35,000 Vets in WI use Medicaid. How does GOP define patriotism? In  or in supporting those who risked their lives 4 you? 
@SarahKSilverman @will_c_fischer, dobar dan
This is total bullshit. Outright lies
First of all - There is NO TRUMP CARE! You are misinformed. Your problems stem from the Obama Ghetto. Congress is the "Problem"!
Hey @senrobportman stand up for your constituents! Dont bow down to your party.
Million will lose. 20 to 3o million all told.  Then GOP will work to kill Medicare. And Medicaid
They want a single payer so we gave death panels, rationing while they vote themselves platinum heath care paid for by us
VOTE NO NO NO NO #GrahamCassidyBill
Vote noo
But the rich are suffering, they need these tax breaks. Didn't you get the memo? They get tax breaks so they can hire more people it trickle
Veterans, send outstanding bills to lake house of @SenSanders He will loose w taxes. @MMFlint @MarkRuffalo @ShaunKing you up? #IServed #USAF
No on wants single payer and univeral. Just DROP the subject. and Let insurance companies scramble for our business. Fuck it.
Obama care
Well done, sir!
This deserves a spot on TV. No one has earned good health care more than US Vets! And Will is right...Repubs are pro-life only until birth.
mccains been flipped to a yes..
This is a revolting situation.  Wat happened to him ???
Call Silvermans ticket sales office as well. I hear the bus will come by and pick you up
#promedicare=prolife
You tell it like it is sir. Thank you.
I don't think the words "Trump" and "care" can go together.
Right! And neither can the words Trump and President.
It's worse
Do u know how to respond to tweets? Or r u too above us kin folk?
Show my how any veteran will lose health care under this or any bill??
Hoo-Rah! Very well said. I pray your fellow vets hear you and heed your counsel.
@SenJohnMcCain listen to the Veterans. Don't take healthcare away from millions & protect coverage for pre-existing conditions

Love the intensity!!!!!!!!!!!!
The ghost of Smedley Butler is about to ride again...
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
@SenToddYoung  who will you stand with?
Just one more way @RepBrianMast turned his back on fellow veterans. #FL18 will never forget your crucial vote to advance Trumpcare, snake.
#GrahamCassidy is as bad, or worse than the previous versions by *other* names. Still the same  Flush it and forget it. #SaveACA
Save #ACA

@SenJoniErnst  @SenTomCotton If you vote in favor of Graham-Cassidy, you are voting against Vets. @dougducey @KimberlyYeeAZ @JDMesnard
Please don't play with people's life that you are entrusted to protect. Vote no to this vicious and greedy bill. People will not forgive.
Please appeal as Vets to @SenJohnMcCain, maybe he'll listen to your logic & supporting facts.#noGrahamCassidy
I agree vote vets
Of course it is and of course it will. 

We read the bill @BillCassidy @LindseyGrahamSC Do you think so little of Veterans? Cassidy said states get "billions." He means GOP states.

Another Obamacare repeal is gaining traction, but anti-repeal activists may be too busy to notice http://thebea.st/2fvrA72  
Why is no one talking under Obamacare health care costs and rates skyrocketing for middle class #bipartisanwouldbenice
Preach!!!
Everyone please call your senators to vote no on graham/cassidy bill that will leave 32 million people uninsured.
Vets have health care through the military & can go to the VA, how could their health care be taken away? Fake News
Protect those who have sacrificed for USA.  @commondefense @ABC @BBCWorld @CNN @CBSNews @NBCNews @CNBC @latimes @chicagotribune @business
#stopGrahamCassidy
@SenJohnMcCain not all veterans have access to the system you have access to. Protect our vets and No!!
I despise Trump

It really is just a bunch of damn poop!!
