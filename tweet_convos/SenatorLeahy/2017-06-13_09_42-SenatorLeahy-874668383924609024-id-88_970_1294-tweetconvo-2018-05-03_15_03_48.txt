well, you should know about bad healthcare bills so perhaps we should take your word on this.
Are you ready to exercise your right to unlimited amendments to this reconciliation bill?  Please have 100 ready!
Senators you work for the American people. Why are you legislating in secret?
@GOP @DNC This is exactly how Hitler Began.  This @POTUS and @GOP MUST BE STOPPED now.  This will make #TRITLER GREAT  and not the USA
Disgraceful. The people will remember this. Keep fighting, Senator.  #NoTrumpcare
Feels weird up-voting a tweet that reports US Congress is still actively trying to kill me. Scary with a president that will sign it.
Bet there will be reporters at the celebration in the rose garden after the perpetrate this hideous crime against americans
I don't feel represented. Is this a dictatorship? Are my tax $$ going towards rewards to certain elite donors? THIS IS WRONG!
Clearly GOP is working on it! Read @sarahkendzior an expert on totalitarian governments
Grab a cameraman and drag them somewhere safe to get yourself on TV denouncing this! Don't just tweet to your followers. Speak to the nation
Hahaha i remember pass the bill to find out whats in it...good for goose is good for gander deal with it like we had to
ACA had hearings. False equivalency
Wrong, did you forget the closed door meetings that NO GOP was allowed access EXACTLY the same
It's not bad but definitely better than what we have, which is nothing
Do you think they will wait till midnight to pass it or over a holiday...Just saying some people in congress are kinda sleazy.
What was your part in the attempted assassination of GOP whip?
This is democracy? NOT!
It's about more than the bill...better start being LOUD! Smells like a #takeover to me
It's a Death warrant for thousands of sick Americans, how bad does it have to be beyond that?
What areyou doing 'about it sir?
@SenToomey staff keeps saying there's nothing written yet, nothing to show us. Somehow I don't believe them. What is #gop hiding?
So much for government transparency may as well be a communistic form of governing with ties to Russia why not
Time to really raise a stink...Let's have Vermont's Senators lead the charge. We know this maneuver for what it is: shameful!
Oh for gods sake do something, u must still have some power left,fight!!!
@CNN @JoyAnnReid Goodbye 2 the Republican party in 2018 when Trump voters lose their healthcare & voters find out its all about money 4 RICH
Please use EVERY parliamentary delay available to stop #TrumpCare vote!!! Dem Senators need to fight fire with fire!!!#2000Amendments
SO SHUT IT DOWN. No hearings. Walkout.
Really really bad for America, and Republicans beware America is watching and we will vote you out of office!!!!
WTH?

@SenToddYoung 
@SenDonnelly
Withhold consent
What are they waiting for?  Does everyone at least get free beer?
I have been consistently disconnected from Sen Heller office when I call to ask or express my opinion about this bill. Why is he there then?
Don't let them get away with it! We can't stand by & let McConnell et al ride roughshod over the citizens' right to determine our future!
This is a disgrace. Who ordered this ?
These were strategies of authoritarian regimes of history per #OnTyranny by historian T Snyder. Do we listen to history & act b4 too late?
You Communist Democrats ARE really B-A-D, for planet Earth in general!
By going 2 such extremes don't they realize tht ppl r gathering 4 an epic battle if not now then 2018, 2020, 2021 wll cause ppl 2 remember 
Maybe they just didn't want you guys to run out with misinformation and pushing your political rhetoric...while the debate was ongoing..
So Members of House may feel safe bec of gerrymandering. Why do Senators not fear the wrath of their voters in passing unpopular bill?
Yes it's kills and stupid #ClownTrump don't care, @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu @RepCummings @JoyAnnReid @clairecmc @rosadelauro @maddow @AC360
AMERICA look @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @VP @GOPLeader @SenSanders @RepAdamSchiff @CharlesMBlow @funder @ananavarro @GOP @NAACP @Oprah
Yes it's kills and stupid #ClownTrump don't care, @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu @RepCummings @JoyAnnReid @clairecmc @rosadelauro @maddow @AC360
Go get ' em Senator!!!
Its so bad I can't wait til 2018 elections to see how bad republicans lose House, Senate seats, respect from there constituents ect...ect...
Dear Christians viciously attacking President Trump&his family. You Christians who are FILLED w/hate may I suggest actually READING UR Bible
R's are not acting like a party that believes in what they are doing.  Hold them accountable on Election Day.  That is how democracy works.
Health insurance should be non-profit or a 95% tax on profits
maybe, but not as bad as yours were, senator
You have to pass the bill to find out whats in it, ya know goose/gander thing
How can any of this be legal?
Really bad. Just waiting to  want they come out with, so I can laugh my ass off. #TrumpMinions
Welcome to the GOP lead dictatorship of the new Russia!
RT to agree that Democrats should halt ALL Senate business until press access is restored, they #ShowUsTheBill, and hold a hearing on it!
this will became the first of many confidential classed bills, no one will be able to see or read but law. Just #SOP for #GOP
Pubs will try ANYTHING to avoid the light. Like roaches.
And Inhofe and Lankford staffers assured me by phone that the process will be open and with debate.
They said so yesterday.
I just want to know how many lobbyists have been hanging out from know insurance companies...
Apparently Republicans think they can attempt to take healthcare from millions to enrich corrupt cronies with #TrumpCare
Pres. is once again calling Dems obstructionists regarding OCare. We need to publically push back on this. It's infuriating.
The Republicans are acting like a dictatorial regime #ConstitutionalCrisis at hand
of course it is .. the worst thing is nationwide the Democrats get more votes for House Senate & Presidency yet are cut out at every turn
Please find out what's in it ASAP!
Where are Graham, Collins n McCain???? Are ALL the GOP rolling over?? They're "next" to Kiss The RING! Hope it's LIVE!
I don't see how this could even happen? Doesn't sound legal?
So stop it. Scorched earth. No unanimous consent. Quorum calls.

We need you, Senator. Don't Beltway us.
Get Dems. Go find reporters. Talk to about HCare as close to the restricted area as possible. Please. @SenateDems @TheDemocrats #NOtoACHA
#RepublicanDeathCareAct
Is this media restriction legal? Why is this administration allowed to destroy so many time honored government precedences and traditions?
This is being imposed by the Senate Majority.
Has GOP still excluded themselves from it? If so, you know its a toxic death sentence to many, in order to benefit the wealthiest of wealthy
You are so enjoyable!
So go nuclear on it ffs. God forbid you actually get seen fighting for people
I know there's a lot to fight these days, but this one's personal. Don't let #TrumpCare pass. #SaveMedicaid #PreexistingCondition #NoAHCA
Senator, you and the Dems should propose a bill to fix the ACA.  Start w/ not allowing insurance co's to opt out of the individual market.
The ins co's profits are huuuuge.  If they want the lucrative group business, then they must also be in the individual ins market.
Dems should not sit in the sidelines waiting to see what the Republicans come up with on healthcare. Take the lead, show us you have ideas!
Communism is the Democrat's idea!
pls "LEAK" all details to the public The @SenateGOP r attempting to manage our republic like a Putin state.Russia rules in the USA #STOPGOP
Do something Senator!
CALL YOUR SENATORS. 202.224.3121. FLOOD THOSE PHONE LINES. DO NOT PASS #AHCA
It's horrendous!  What are y'all doing about it to stop it/help us...?
The Senate had now become the House
Thank you senator! New rules may also be to distract from or restrict reporting on this afternoon's Intel committee hearing w/ AG Sessions.
Any wonder why people hate Congress? It isn't just all the bad ideas but the arrogance.
are the R not on the committee just going to vote yes because they are told to?  THAT needs to be public
How will you respond to these unprecedented moves?
Does GOP want a dictatorship?  'Cause that's how you get a dictatorship.
Its rightfully named as Trump would be the only one benefiting from this
we have to pass it to see what's in it.  isn't that how it goes?
