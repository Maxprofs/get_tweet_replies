Heart goes out to everyone on the force and to officer Perez's family ..Heros all..RIP
I have heard that Antifa are training people on how to get violent with police-that line in the sand is drawn-we are with you Blue!!
And btw, the left supports the police too...we just don't do it blindly...if someone abuses power is wrong, no matter who they are
I'm pleased U support police-weed out Antifa w/ cell in Phil,PA-training members to violent 2police-I wonder who's behind all the killings
Antifa is not the left...they are an outlier ...I get their general principle, but violence never helps
Yes Antifa is the radical Ault left-completely-100,000 signature petition to label them Terrorist-& why won't they show their faces?
3 million people marched at Women's March in Jan with almost zero incidents...that's the real left and progressive movement
I understand what U R saying but those with say- elite corrupt wealthy obstructionist have the say-they scream we the people have no rights!
God will see you through this along with the American people and the POTUS sending prayers
How are you doing Noah, praying for you also to get better !!!
Thank you! I'm doing good! How are you?
I am well Noah but it is you I so often pray for, is the illness in remission
