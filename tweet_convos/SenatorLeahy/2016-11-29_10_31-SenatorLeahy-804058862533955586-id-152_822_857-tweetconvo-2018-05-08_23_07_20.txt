@mcuban @MargHartmann @intelligencer The investigation will go on and HRC will be held accountable. No need 2 advertise.
He was just on tv saying he is no cheerleader and wait until he is in office!Relax!
@mcuban @MargHartmann @intelligencer Kind of the opposite with main stream media.
@jasoninthehouse @sltrib @MyDesert @lds_church Time to explain thats not the right thing to do
Jason needs to investigate wrong doing not ignore
@mcuban @RobbyMook
And so it begins: Why I Will Not Cast My Electoral Vote for Donald Trump, via @nytimes http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/05/opinion/why-i-will-not-cast-my-electoral-vote-for-donald-trump.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&smid=nytcore-iphone-share …
Jason Chaffetz is a worm, always has been, always will be.
Cubans Failed NBA franchise the Mavs are 2-8 and 15th out of 15 teams. Cuban must sell to Trump NOW
And Trump is actually guilty of all the things they falsely accused Hillary of
trump is a vestal virgin compared to all the dirt they found on hillary. Hilarious!
@mcuban @MargHartmann @intelligencer I love to read all the posts from the sore losing Libtards. It gives me such joy 
And it was the only thing he was really good at! This is painfully hypocritical.
Just like the rest he is a hypocrite!
@metaquest @MargHartmann do your job @jasoninthehouse #trumpistheswamp
@mcuban Trump's first broken promise, he will not pursue email or Clinton Foundation #badpardon @MargHartmann @intelligencer
@mcuban @MargHartmann @intelligencer Sour grapes. I told you Mark that you were over invested in HRC.Still owe DT staff aplgy
@mcuban @MargHartmann @intelligencer You lefty billionaires need to start dumping money into lefty media
.@jonathanchait @SenatorLeahy @MargHartmann 
Funny wasn't @GOPoversight @jasoninthehouse given a directorate by @StateDept for HRC investig?
I just readwhere hisoffice just praised DT for hisethics referring to his business announcement
@mcuban @MargHartmann @intelligencer  Loser
He's afraid of trump like so many weak kneed soft sleazy coackroaches show them light of truth
@mcuban @MargHartmann @intelligencer Buy the way, Mark Cuban is a dick! A rich dick, but a dick non-the-less.
cubanloser. The first time so involved. And switched lanes when we won loser :)
Sorry but factual: Chaffetz' office is "government" oversight. Trump never held gov office.  FTC or FBI, maybe.
Really!! Trump hasn't been sworn in yet!
@mcuban @MargHartmann @intelligencer Even better then that, is the added happiness I get from seeing how Fk'd up the dems are
@mcuban @MargHartmann @intelligencer He doesn't care for country - just power within the Republican Party - sad.
@mcuban @MargHartmann @intelligencer Now what kind of B.S. can you do to make your name Relevant?
#Bomber
Jason Chaffetz acts like a tool of Peter Schweizer, the GAI, Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, Jim Kallstrom, etc
@mcuban @MargHartmann @intelligencer yea. Baby.. if your lucky they won't come after you next
@jasoninthehouse Sorry J - your 15 minutes are over.
You remark upon this as if it weren't obvious & expected. Every GOP investigation of Hillary was bullshit.
@mcuban @MargHartmann @intelligencer Cuban is a joke...can't even run a bball team...
@mcuban @MargHartmann Really don't like to name call on twitter but what a complete ass.
@mcuban @jasoninthehouse His mind will get changed for him.Trump won't survive4yrs w/o impeachment.He's a LIAR,CHEAT&THIEF!
Draining the swamp! Not!!
@mcuban @MargHartmann @intelligencer He's a good R. Party first..... Americans second.
@mcuban @MargHartmann @intelligencer Chaffetz is an embarrassment, we need $ and help from outside Utah to oust him.
of all of the sniveling hypocrites, Chaffetz comes across as the most craven & feckless.
@mcuban @MargHartmann I wish someone would wipe that smirk off his face.
who holds Chaffetz accountable. Obviously he's not actually interested in upholding the law.
@mcuban @MargHartmann @intelligencer Who's got the flip flop lead? Mitt Romney or JJ. It's got to be close!
oh get your dicks down..there will be plenty of Dems and the media that will hound Trump. It's politics
@mcuban @MargHartmann @intelligencer So we're not really interested in the truth!
@sarahchurchwell @MargHartmann @intelligencer the breathtaking brazen shamelessness
@mcuban @MargHartmann @intelligencer He's a gutless coward. What did you expect?
Chaffetz better do his job , over sight on Trump. He works for the people., not  Trump, for the people
@mcuban @MargHartmann @intelligencer just proves all this shit for the last few years has been partisan with hunts!
@mcuban @MargHartmann @intelligencer Chaffetz is complete hack with no credibility. He needs to be "primaried"
@mcuban @MargHartmann @intelligencer WAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!!
@mcuban @MargHartmann @intelligencer WAAAHHHHH!! WAAHHHHH!! WAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Chaffetz is a poser not a patriot.
he is not even president yet and u complain about this come on
Hypocritical Old Party
These are professional politicians. They do not listen to Americans. They drive the car, we walk
@summerbrennan @MargHartmann @intelligencer he closes his eyes to obvious conflicts that would've taken down any Democrat.
That calculating furrow in his brow shows up briefly when he almost contemplates what a partisan hack he is.
No more kicking that old dog. Do not give up theres another hag in line. Liz Warren is nasty  too!
@JenGranholm @MargHartmann @intelligencer just like k McCarthy said, it was a witch hunt
How's about spineless hypocrite? Shoe seems to fit rather well
Chaffetz is an evil man...
@JenGranholm @MargHartmann @intelligencer   You can't expect INTEGRITY from someone unfamiliar with the concept.
This is one easy to hate poor excuse for a man...
@JenGranholm @MargHartmann @intelligencer. Chavitz is a bully, like Trump.  And hypocrite, like entire GOP.  ALL ABOUT POWER.
@JenGranholm @MargHartmann @intelligencer I really don't know how these guys rationalize to themselves their behavior
@JenGranholm @MargHartmann @intelligencer waiting to see who will break out and be a leader!
@CarolynnHagstr1 @MargHartmann @intelligencer if only we had I don't know an @FBI 2 investigate his collusion wait never mind
@JenGranholm @MargHartmann @intelligencer our politicians are falling in line for the emperor!
@JenGranholm @MargHartmann @intelligencer Who is going to stop Trump? He does not care. He will do what he wants.
Well its a different day and Trump has an R by his name, nothing to see here move along
The @GOP & @jasoninthehouse are a crime family and somehow Fredo got to be Capo. d' Capo
He's a POS. He stopped funding increase for Benghazi. Pond scum.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6BLMz1chEM …
@JenGranholm @MargHartmann @intelligencer how is he looking in his daughters eyes again??
@ASFried @MargHartmann Abd such a target-rich environment, too.
@nicolemerchut @MargHartmann @intelligencer Then the Dems have to do something to stop him and focus on "our" president elect
@jasoninthehouse Bought and paid for. Not a principled bone in this hideous creature's body.
maybe Trey Gaudy can step in?
Chaffetz when are the investigations and hearing on Trump obvious conflicts going to begin
can American people file class action agnst Trump for being a lying, cheating racist?  Say yes 
dude's a sociopath, like all these fuckers.
@summerbrennan @MargHartmann @jasoninthehouse You need to put country b4 party and do your job.  4.
@summerbrennan @MargHartmann stop referring to #trump's blind trust, Jonathan. It's currently neither blind nor a trust
Chaffetz is a spineless weasel. Trump would steamroller right over him and he knows it.
@summerbrennan @MargHartmann @jasoninthehouse  if you refuse to look into both Dems & Repubs?  3.
@summerbrennan @MargHartmann @jasoninthehouse & claim your committee investigates fraud & abuse  2.
@summerbrennan @MargHartmann @jasoninthehouse Jason, how can you claim accountability as a core value 1.
@summerbrennan @MargHartmann @intelligencer  this is sickening. We need to call his office and demand he investigate.
I wonder how many bodies with cement booties he's dropped into Hudson Bay.  He *looks* evil
His staff will brow beat you, when you call his office to ask that they look into conflicts wDJT
@LisaMirandoCNN @MargHartmann @intelligencer Elections have consequences. -Barak Obama
I still say he looks like the sneaky kid who sits in the back of the room&rats out the other kids
@JeremyDDickey @MargHartmann @intelligencer  What kind of people have the voters sent back to CONGRESS? Dear God!
I will never forget u using fakefacts frm the conservativemedia to attack Planned Parenthood
Obviously Chaffetz has his hands full as he tries to explain to his daughter why he helped elect this man.
pathetic
@LATimesTVLloyd @MargHartmann @intelligencer 
He's not stupid! You don't go after a dictator, guys!!
Because he's corrupt like the rest of him.
@Synergism3 @MargHartmann @intelligencer don't worry he will try to keep investigating Hillary to distract from Trump con
@LoriWest2 @MargHartmann @intelligencer Of course he will not investigate. To much time on his knees in front of Trump. 
(Shrug) I expected nothing different.He helped Trump get elected by leaking the Comey letter
@summerbrennan @MargHartmann @intelligencer That spineless sycophant @jasoninthehouse, bought + paid for by @realDonaldTrump.

@summerbrennan @MargHartmann @jasoninthehouse you're a fraud, Chaffetz
True Republican
@vela_mary @MargHartmann @intelligencer @jasoninthehouse is a fraud-He had. BIG mouth when he was lying about #Hillary
but has he lost interest in looking his daughter in the eye again? that's the real story.
Partisan Jackass
too bad we didn't elect someone to #draintheswamp it sure seems like the system is rigged
Jason's perpetual smug sneer is his answer
Why focus on this spineless dork? Same guy who un-endorsed Trump because he IS a pervert.
Why is hypocrisy surprising among partisans? By definition a partisan helps friends / harms enemies
he went from being one of the most powerful republicans to one of the most insignificant
.@jonathanchait @MargHartmann for all the @GOP complaints about #bothsides their hypocrisy is crazy. Jam the phone lines  (202) 225-7751
Done! Keep calling everyone.
He needs to be fired!  @SpeakerRyan Keeping you informed as always
one of the biggest assholes in government..  Hate his fucking guts...
Gee, what changed his mind?
He should be ashamed.
#DoYourJob or get out of the way!  #DerilictionOfDuty #OathOfOffice @ziggyz2020 @jonathanchait @MargHartmann  @RepCummings
Wow, it's almost like you don't know how politics works. He would investigate the other party, but not his own, shocking!
@ImpactDemocracy @MargHartmann @intelligencer oh that girl again
#GOP would see this country and everything in it burn for their donors' wealth enhancement.
I wonder if the magic spell that turned him from an angry beaver into a human wears off now that HRC's not pres
we had such high hopes for Jason. Alas, another politician.
Brazen hypocrisy, naked ambition.
Paid for by the Koch Brothers and ALEC.
It's a partisan shit-shop.
