John, you were a Pow , maybe you should be investigated along with those who were with you ... Shame on you
@SenatorLeahy @SenJohnMcCain The shoes should be dropped on your head to bring you to your political senses. Maybe a RINO shoe!
@realDonaldTrump
Senator, you need to ACTUALLY do something - you're acting like a coward, and you are a hero - you know better.
@justinhendrix @SenJohnMcCain




#PresidentTrump IS #PRESIDENT BECAUSE #WETHEPEOPLE ELECTED HIM.PERIOD! Shame on you Sen.
Stone will be the one to ask for immunity and rat everyone else out. Mark my word.
I think Flynn already flipped. That's why he was MADE to register as foreign agent.
well his lawyers made him. You're right he's already running scared. One of them will be the rat.
do you even realize talk shows&showmen like you on both sides are part of the problem? No one talks, educates or hears eachother
@Donna_DHKBB @SenJohnMcCain Oh, those Shoes
They include golden showers
Dirty Russian Oil
Best Pal Advisor 
Schwarzman 
Traitor
I can't wait for soros's to fire McCain for being so stupid. Drawing attention to his globalist ties!
If @SenJohnMcCain thinks hes going to be the savior of the RNC in 2020. Think again. He might as well go Democrat now! #CNNSOTU
Then get your fellow Republicans to declare the emperor has no clothes. Russia hacked the election. Pure & simple
@JenniferNail3 @SenJohnMcCain -I mean, since the CIA has the ability to spy on...
Russia and gather intelligence that may prove Trump has colluded with Russia, then if I were...
... Trump, it would be in my best interest to discredit the CIA.
there are no winners in media.CNN is behaving like @foxnews did w/ BO.Just report,educate&keep your bias out Stop w/cage matches
The FBI is a shoe? How about Exxon-Russia deal that McCain is helping facilitate?
@Laura_A_Diaz @SenJohnMcCain More gossip mongering - show the proof!  #Vault7 says it was a black propaganda op by #DNC
Read the article not just the headline. Are "we" against McCain now too?
yes I read the article. Where's the evidence? There's none. Tapper is slime
I respectfully disagree w/your OPINION &will not participate worthless diatribe. Good day
TAPPER /MCCAIN TWO LIBERAL LOSERS. MCCAIN ' S ONLY REAL SUCCESS WAS AS A POW. SACRED COW IF THERE EVER WAS ONE
. Songbird?
we know why Bharara was fired. Too close for comfort for trump as he was investigating the trump/Russia deals.
Google --President Nixon give John McCain a pardon
if @SenJohnMcCain has valid concerns about Trump why vote for all his cabinet appointees, etc?
he's Republican. Wouldnt it be interestg if there were no Gop no Dems ? Work togthr
I hope one of those shoes hit @SenJohnMcCain in the head.
you should require more of yourself&your guest Cage matches are uneducated, annoying& degrading of the massive platform you have
that's funny I just see the old guy looking under his couch for his missing shoes. I know it's not right
.shoes or slippers?
Two Dopes on a Rope Hillary still got you in the Balls ?
How about McCain address the ongoing questions and fact-finding about his treason in Vietnam?
Don't Care About Centipedes And Their Shoes-Just A Single Boot In The Ass To Get This Old Fool Out Of Washington!
when you start to do the right thing for America on the Senate, then your words will matter to us.
@ViewFromWise @SenJohnMcCain What does this American expression mean?
.@jaketapper @Donna_West @SenJohnMcCain Another McCain Bait & Switch. Talk like a Maverick, Vote the Party line. So, meh!
McCain is the same guy now that he was eight years ago when you Republicans tried to elect him president.
how many shoes does it take to rouse a sleeping GOP?
It's raining shoes hallelujah. It's raining shoes hallelujah!
I have no doubt. Trump clearly knows more than he lets on. Also, it's clear that McCain needs his war juice.
John McCain is a little nuts at this point. And yet you loons put him on the air
"Venomous and deadly" centipede.
And I can't wait ,Just don't let them be my red sole heel ...
Oh, please please please please
McCain wants evidence on the wiretapping, he is not demanding evidence on Russia? Where is the evidence
the waiting is the hardest part
Who else came here for the centipede schematic
Strange metaphor there John.
Yes the collusion with John McCain  in 2008 when he asked for funding. They weren't so bad he would't ask them?
Time to stop dancing around it, @SenJohnMcCain What's it going to be? Country or party? Tick tock.
@POTUS Tapper you #talk and 'stir' up #issues. Rightfully #compensated. I am yet to appreciate one #logical question? 
what do you know about #Turkey and #Russia #involvement in #Syria except an #elementary #school talk?
Tapper great 'play' on putting words in mouth of McCain. Very evident check & mate  'Chess' with Russians.
he didn't say which direction though, don't you pee you pants yet!
Good job, Jake!
if it wasnt for McCain & Graham being closet DEMS, CNN wouldnt have any real options continue their Russia story
@brianstelter @SenJohnMcCain
Talk is cheap Senator. Your future actions will speak much louder than hollow words.
Lock them up!!Lock them up!!Lock them up!!Lock them up!!
Um, can we go ahead and drop them footwears already? My heart can only take so many more headlines.
100 shoes!
Keep asking questions and DEMAND an independent investigation! Both of you, please.
@PayDownTheDebt @SenJohnMcCain Sometimes it takes men and women with Integrity to stand up and speak truth to power.
Let the "shoes" drop quickly before our country is destroyed by this JERK !
How many shoes will it take?  Enough already.  #Trumprussia
@brianstelter @SenJohnMcCain Hopefully the shoe will drop directly on the @Cheetoe #POTUS and his corrupt children.
@Only_Sn0wman @SenJohnMcCain 
Yeah, McCain really went out on a limb there. Not.
be the hero that we know you are and get to the bottom of this nightmare! 
thank God for McCain. Love that he called him a stooge.
AND YET YOU AND YOUR FELLOW Rs DO *NOTHING*- putting party over country while we glide down the slope to fascism
We need to see EXPLICITLY how bad it is. Promise 2 avoid clichÃ©s: shoes, rabbit holes, dominoes, threads, onions.
rooting for ballsy McCain, not timid 1 step forward 2 steps back party liner. @SenJohnMcCain your country is in peril and it is from the top
@leahmcelrath @SenJohnMcCain  WHY is McCain relevant? Has he demanded hearings? No Has he denounced complicit GOP? No
@dennissweatt @SenJohnMcCain
@SenatorLeahy @SenJohnMcCain can turn a phrase!
.@jaketapper The fact that you give credence to random conjectures from bitter old @SenJohnMcCain is why your network is mocked.
Bitter Old "Corrupt" @SenJohnMcCain #OnlyOutForHimself
sorry  Bitter Old "Corrupt" "Keating Five" @SenJohnMcCain #OnlyOutForHimself
Feel heartened to see lawmakers in the president's own party put nation's vital interests over partisanship.
@TeddyDavisCNN @SenJohnMcCain No shit shirlock
Prove Russia did anything more than they've ever done b4! Or, more than Obama's interference in others elections
CIA #umbrage #Vault7 CIA does the crime. Leave fake digital track of an enemy state ie Russia included
Then I expect Sen McCain to help drop those shoes, not vote with GOP after complaining about them
Why doesn't McCain talk about Podesta getting 20k monthly deposits from Russian bank for 6 months in 2016?
.@jaketapper @SenJohnMcCain
@ladyoldandgray @SenJohnMcCain The question not asked is,"What's being done about it?"
Simultaneously, @SenJohnMcCain is providing hope to freedom-loving Americans and crafting solid children's book plotlines here!
That's B.S. - McCain was referring to Roger Stone who was fired by Trump in September 2015.
@ladyoldandgray @SenJohnMcCain Go John McCain but he didn't sound optimistic anything was going to be done or answers obtained
Hey mccain watch out we know you've done felony favors We'll have last laugh  BTW What's that
meanwhile, he's defending the firing of competent prosecutors? Just drop the damn shoes and let's do this.
@brianstelter @SenJohnMcCain why dont yall call him out on this tough talk not matching up with his voting... actions>words
If only you could find more viewership so you wouldn't need to tweet out every quote #fakenews
@brianstelter @SenJohnMcCain McCain's specifically referring to Roger Stone who Trump fired in Sept 2015. McCain's paid by Soros
@leahmcelrath @SenJohnMcCain Still waiting for "outraged" Republicans to DO something beside wring their hands.
Cool soundbyte but I feel like @SenJohnMcCain has been cockteasing for months now
Agreed.
McCain gets secret briefings. Enjoying 45 twisting in wind
Russia is our ally, too bad killing stuff is John's solution to every problem he imagines. #warcriminal
@HuffingtonPost When is someone going to DO SOMETHING about all of this. Why are our representative just watching? DO YOUR JOBS.
The question is knowing they are shady with Russia. Why is he still in office.????????
Thank you Sen McCain.
Senator use a hammer and sickle
@brianstelter @SenJohnMcCain so drop some FRIGGIN shoes!!!! What are your waiting for "maverick"?? You have the power!!!!
Funny...if you look at this thread, ALL the support for Mccain comes from those who lean left.  #telling
Putin is not happy with you Sen you must be on to something
OK, well, is something going to, like, HAPPEN? Or is it just going to rain shoes for 4 years?
I'm sorry Senator, but you need to start speaking out on the Senate floor where it counts, not in a sound byte.
Can he go on record where they will be able to use his words against him?
Thank God we have Sen. John McCain , one who honors his Country , Constitution and Justice. Some things are Not For Sale. Thank You.
could @SenJohnMcCain just be hinting at "more shoes to drop" to quiet us down in expectation?
Agree not enough.
@bradyactual @SenJohnMcCain no shoes have dropped yet, two out of touch people, @SenJohnMcCain @jaketapper
Actions, not words, will show who's side you're on, McCain. Country or party. It's time to decide.
very true. You will never get an answer. It's all 'elementary' school drama.
I use to really like McCain, but he has proven to be all talk and no action like the rest of the @GOP. #gettowork
Yeah Barry the Russian Muslim insurgent exposed for the traidtor he is! Ahahaha lyin'media
when RINOs chase a wild goose
Thank you for your dedication @SenJohnMcCain - We  you!!

#trumprussia #RussiaGate #Liars #RussianDossier
.@jaketapper @SenJohnMcCain centipedes don't wear shoes
thanks for not saying "H**** centipede"
Human Centipede: Russia + Trump Edition: starring Flynn + Manafort + Page + Gordon + Sessions + Jared + ?
You both are spineless. No one cares what Tapper declares, no one supports McCain because he is a traitor to USA.
. @jaketapper @SenJohnMcCain Semi Hero McCain is a Democrat. There are several others who ran as republicans like him. TERM LIMITS!!!!!
Oh. Boy. Yes, there is.
Maybe, but McMain's a self-serving opportunist.  Takes ANY position that's politically beneficial for himself.
Lots of babies
Time for action, McCain. Big talk does not a Maverick make.
Jake give it up. The Russians story you pushed fell apart. Just like your credibility and reputation. Sad!
One can only hope.  Please do the right thing and help get the truth out, John.  #TheResistance
from the man who takes pictures with terrorists
Can't someone just grab an anvil and get it over with?
Do you know that the people behind a lot of this call themselves centipedes? Go look on Reddit-search 'centipede'
I can see the Senator keeping up on Reddit
He, or someone on his staff should.
McCain needs to be immediately transported to assisted living.
HERE WE GO :) I PREDICT NYT IN <2 WEEKS
Good. Hope it's soon.
