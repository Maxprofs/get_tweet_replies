He should not get a hearing until the legitimacy of the President is resolved.
you are living in a delusion. It is resolved, deal with it. Hillary is a crook!
.@gasdonutdriver @SenatorLeahy @SenateDems  Whatever let's you sleep at night 
is a big dope
Just as Far Left interest groups vett liberal judges who legislate from the bench. Your double standard is sickening. Time to retire.
What about the nazi college clubs?
You're more concerned that Gorsuch rules on the word of the law, not on whatever cause the left has that day!
Not concerned about Soros and move on? @CNN @MiceeMouse @LindaSuhler @FoxNews  @immigrant4trump @katyperry @newtgingrich
Judge Gorsuch answering your questions shows why he should be on the Court. Made you look like you should get a new job.
many Trump cronies lied under oath at confirmation hearings. Words R meaningless 4 his bunch, follow historical actions
Sen mr leahy is losing it.  He should retire.
I was just saying the same thing.
No it's the art of a lawyer to ask repeated questions in different ways. Leahy was awesome.
losing train of thought, stuttering and sometimes confused. LoL
Called pausing to think before speaking. Good quality when everything recorded for posterity.
and every time a lawyer asks the same thing "in diff ways",after the first 5x,aggravating!
@SenateDems @WSJ until the criminal investigation of this administration is complete this #SCOTUS nom process should be halted
I am deeply concerned that you may very well have mental health issues. That much is very clear.
You and Nancy Pelosi may be able to get a discount if you get Alzheimer's tests together.
“We the People’ will accept your resignations effective immediately. You codswallop during Neil Gorsuch’s Committee hearing
@SenateDems @WSJ He was far-right in college. His decisions haven't matured to reflect depth over dogma.
Obstruct this nominee please, Senator.  Do not reward the GOP for what they did to Merrick Garland and Pres. Obama
@SenateDems No worse than you liberals shoving crap down our throats for years!
well we are deeply concerned you and Feinstein are turning this into politics, typical democrats
One of the greatest stains on this country is that you haven't been term limited out, you statist fossil.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews TO LEAHY: I am deeply concerned that YOU are one of the BIGGEST SWAMP SWIMMERS THAT NEEDS DRAINING.

Nxt.?;CORPORATIONS AREN'TcitizensBECAUSEtheyCAN'Tbe imprisoned;i.e. San Bruno pipeline fire @PGE4Me ,which now has RATE PAYERS PAYINGtheFINE
Remember Re-read Federalist 9,10? You took an oath to uphold, not dismantle, the Constitution.
@SenateDems @WSJ We all know it's true.
most be rough being a living breathing fossil. Retire you are a had been!
@SenateDems How do Dems even justify having this hearing?
Are you senile?
Derms have to stand as one against this nomination. This will be a disaster.
You're going to lose, stop being a big baby and confirm this overqualified nominee so you can get on with other business
@SenateDems TY, Mr. Leahy. Please vote No
r u forgetting the vetting that went on for him a while back??? approved unanimously. you fool
@SenateDems We the People are too!  Help us; SOS
@SenateDems @WSJ Please stop p urveying rumor and innuendo. You know better
Please ask about autism and education and his anti-disability rulings. He is horrid for disabled and Americans #NoGorsuch #AutismRights
judge gorsuch will overturn unconstitutional ny un safe act
Let's remember Gorsuch was handpicked for Colorado judgeship by reclusive billionaire Philip Frederick Anschutz
I'm concerned that someone of your age education and position with such power thinks and acts like a spoiled child
@SenateDems So stop this.
On my knees begging, on behalf of America. Pls don't trust him. Like Trump, he'll say ANYTHING to get what he wants.
I am deeply concerned of the problems we have in America & how many ways Congress can waste time we don't have
.@SenatorLeahy @WSJ Why are Democrats even participating in this injustice? This is #MerrickGarland's seat! #NoGuts No to #Gorsuch!
Pls Senator Country before Party! Say NO to Gorsuch! We can undo the things Trump did. We cannot undo this!
@SenatorLeahyhis hate for Trump is so obvious that he has become ineffective. Making #gorsuch look  super intelligent.
Your questions to Gorsuch was a terrible act of wasting time which is the People's time & why Government is messed up
Dems support the vicious rape of a 16 yr old girl At SCHOOL by ILLEGAL aliens. Maryland  High school!!
Sir you are an embarrassment and the greatest argument for term limits. PLEASE ask relevant questions not 100% partisan!
@HouseJudiciary @HouseJudDems Since #StolenSeat from @POTUS44 & #Trumprussia under investigtn hehas NO right 2choose #SCOTUS
I am deeply concerned that your faculties have evacuated your cranium.  You are intellectually unarmed. He is not.
Retire "Old Man!"  Watching you speak is like listening to nails on a chalkboard.  You are a rude disgrace to this country.
god all mighty you are a fool in your questions. Get out of senate. You hurt the lives of real Americans 
That is a stupid argument. I guess you have never asked others for opinions. The source does not diminish the response!
you drunk socialist. please quit
#GetOverIt

#Gorsuch is deflating ur arguments in front of a world stage

#ConfirmGorsuch
ma'am, shake our head yes if you are getting paid to do these tweets
you think you are above the law. Point out Clinton ties to large money from corporations but Democrats one sided lies
I'm going to tell on you

time for a new pretend tweet from the senator, lady.
my god are you off your mess. You are perfect example for term limits. Can not even talk clearly. Your questions are torture
YOU talking about quid pro quo, while IGNORING HILLARYS FOREIGN DONATIONS??!!!! Lol SHUT UP #GorsuchHearing
UP AGAINST GORSUCH U TRULY LOOK LIKE THE 2 BIT HORSESHIT LAWYER UR.
shake your head "no"
OMG Retire already. #TermLimits #GorsuchHearing
Sean., how much do you pay her to tweet for you?
i'm listening to you and wish you would keep an open mind.
He should not be confirmed.
I am DEEPLY CONCERNED about YOUR absurd left-leanings! The MORATORIUM prevents people who present a threat to our country!
the far right is marginalized in USA. The problem is far left like you. This is a right if center nation.
do you have family that can help you?  I am very afraid with someone as unhinged as you being in government at all
you sir, are a pompous windbag. No one is more fit to serve as a supreme Court Justice than judge Gorsuch.
well, I realize Leahy cannot "work" his own accts...However, kicking down a gravel pit owner ... seriously?!? Wow! Ashamed!
lol...she reading my tweets. Smile and nod "yes"
I am deeply concerned that an old man with drool on his chin who can't tie his shoes sits on the Judiciary committee.
I call that tweet-plagiarism, because you can't tweet while asking questions!
Hypocrite Where was your concern on corruption PayTo Play with Clinton Foundation?  If about Charity why was it shut it down?
you can hardly ask a question, your age HAS caught up with you! RETIRE NOW!
him and Diane out to give it up. The world has moved too fast for them
dude you should retire!
is she your house girl? Have her look up again!
So am I senator. Very much concerned.
LOL...she looked up
Leahy is DRUNK!!!
If your good buddy Joe Biden kept his moth shut about appointments during election years Garland may have had a shot!
it's obvious that chick with the goggles on is doing your tweets. Have her look.up if true
Hypocrite!! Someone put this old guy out to pasture!!!!!! #JudgeGorsuch
@Claudia4Trump @SenatorLeahy Two words "term limits"!
Why can't this happen !!! Because both sides won't let it happen 
How about vetting far Left groups that influenced Barack Hussein Obama? Not a single media or congress member vetted Obama.
He did, one time during a state of the union address.
This seat belongs to Merrick Garland and no other.
Why don't you educate yourself! In over 80 years, NEVER has a President tried to fill a SCOTUS seat in an election year. Did you know that?
I see you're a Dreamer.... SO YOU ARE NOT LEGAL.  Not a US Citizen...  so your Opinion doesn't matter!  Poof!
And I see that you are complete fool who jumps to unfounded conclusions.
