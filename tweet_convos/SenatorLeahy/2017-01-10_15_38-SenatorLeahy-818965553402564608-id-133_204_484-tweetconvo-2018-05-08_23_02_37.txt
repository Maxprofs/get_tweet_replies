thanks Al for standing up for voting rights.
wow, you got annihilated by @SenatorSessions was your whole staff drunk writing the questions or just you?
Thank YOU! Keep calling out Sessions & as trump calls him "lying Ted Cruz" on voter suppression!
@vickscan @SenatorSessions @senjudiciary I love good smart Democratics like you keep up the good work Senator Franken
Your history as a racist sob precedes you !@senjudiciary
Franken: DO you believe Minnesota should be EXEMPT from National Voter Registration Act requrmnts
Thank you for pressing this man on his shoddy record
Please tell Cruz to shut the hell up. Immigration isn't dangerous. Fascist GOP tactics are.
so the immigration of criminals and terrorists isn't dangerous. Hope they all move to your hood.
and you can't decide to vote no? Gutless
Thank you! I likr the eay you led him into ot, too. @SenatorSessions @senjudiciary
It's truly sad how #corrupt our #government has become when #JeffSessions has to go through this!
You're good enough. You're smart enough. And gosh darn it, people like you! Thank you.
The heart delivered by @SenFranken in that last round of questions rendered the room so silent you could hear a pin drop. Thank you, Al.
Still trying to be funny?
I’m good enough, I’m smart enough, and dog-gone it, people like me.
Is it true you're undecided on Sessions? Can I please ask you to vote against him?

You’re a credit to the US Senate. Although repeating the “…I’m not a lawyer” bit reminded me so much of Phil Hartman.
you partisan hack you should have respect for your fellow senator and stop being a Radical LOSER!
GREAT line of questioning!  He couldn't even answer your intelligent questions.  He is a pawn.
If Clinton wasn't so dirty along with her Democratic friends and the news media there wouldn't have been anything for anybody to leak!
Seriously like we're supposed to believe CNN Clinton news network. More fake news and your perpetrating it
Thank you! please #stopsessions
Well done & thank you, Sen. Franken.
@SenatorSessions  owned you
For about $300 and illegal IM can obtain everything necessary to vote, ie SS card, birth certificate, license, maybe look into that
@bergjj @SenatorSessions @senjudiciary keep up the good work, Sen. Franken.
Awesome work!
thank u for today. You were great. Wish u were our senator.
Thank you @SenFranken for showing @SenatorSessions true face re: voter suppression. Hope  @senjudiciary sees his true face also
Thank you for your work!   #heroSEN
Thank you Senator!We appreciate your efforts. U play hardball very well!Proud of you & Minnesota today! 
Senator, you seem pretty full of yourself.  The attention needs to be on the problem, not on you strutting your stuff.
8 years of Dems enabling of a politicized AG or the ethics of your initial election by ineligible voters too?
Great job, Senator Franken, thank you for asking the important questions!
lol at you thinking you r relevant #shouldhavestayedatsnl
Senator Franken you did a very good job today
you are as useless in Washington as you were on SNL.
ask the hard questions that need to be asked!  Minnesotans are in support of your efforts!!
Thank you for your work today--well done!
Very concerned about voter suppression & the undermining of our democracy. Thank you @SenFranken
@Sifill_LDF @SenatorSessions @senjudiciary Great job of questioning Al!
thank you!!!!
Great job Senator Franken!
so disappointed in your presentation as a representative of Minnesota government.
Wait a comedian from Minnesota.   Says something about Minnesota it really does.
Team @SenTedCruz - 1
Team @SenFranken - 0

 @SenatorSessions @senjudiciary
This was an EPIC speech by Cruz.
As an African American woman, I thank you & remind you voting rights are in danger.@SenatorSessions @senjudiciary @SenFeinstein
don't find it offensive they believe Blacks incapable of gettin ID?
IDs are expensive and so are the documents to get them. Do research.
so the solution is no ID anyone show up vote? We trust everyone
EVERY election succeeded w/out Voter ID laws. Voter fraud is rare.
voter fraud issues this election in Chicago recount.
Thank you for all your hard work! You are a true patriot!
Didn't work out to good for you.  I don't remember anyone asking obama and his AG about voter suppression in Philadelphia???
Please stay strong. You're the only one who acted like this was a real hearing. @SenatorSessions @senjudiciary @SenFeinstein
when you speak of segregation can you tell me where there was segregation in the 1980's?
@SenFeinstein Please ask him about Jared Kushner & Trump's flaunting of anti-nepotism laws.
@SenatorLeahy Jeff Sessions & entire GOP must be considered compromised as well. The hearings must stop.

Al Franken (who is embarrassingly ignorant) accuses Jeff Sessions of lying. Sessions & Ted Cruz set him straight. http://bit.ly/2idKRbv 
@SenatorLeahy @SenatorSessions @senjudiciary  Senators: You did well.  He stumbled a bit. Thank you.
'wikileaks, I love wikileaks' you were excellent today sir.
when ever you speak people need chest waders .it gets deep and smells
Great job on this. Please explicitly connect this to his enduring attack on voting rights.
Someone needs to drug test Franken, unbelievable babble of nothingness!
I see the Dems sent in the lightweights on Sessions.  Franken and Blumenthal.  Shameful question
ISLAM  INCOMPATIBLE WITH OUR CONSTITUTION YOU MORON DO YOU READ OR KNOW ANY HISTORY  ITS BANNED!!
His confirmation MUST be opposed!
I left a message for my state Senator @SenShelby that I oppose Sessions; your help, and others in government, is still needed.
he totally took the "avoid"path Thank You #SenFranken #StopSessions
thank you for the amazing job. I'm proud you represent my party.
-A cartoon character questioning a real man-LMAO-Frankenberry
Thank you for doing an important job well.
thank you, sir, for making him squirm in his seat.  #notsessions
@SenatorLeahy  With the news that Trump has been compromised by Russia-all hearings must cease. Full stop.
Yeah hold on we will stop it just for you.
you did a great job!
What you did was attempt to impugn the character of a fine Statesman you obnoxious little flea. @SenFranken @SenatorSessions @senjudiciary
Thank you @SenFranken for holding @SenatorSessions accountable to his voting record @senjudiciary
If American right to vote is not protected, we'll never dig out way out of the mess we're in now!
you did fantastic work today. Thank you. Keep on them.
Russia is not threat/aggressor with 1 base vs U.S & NATO around the world
Yes we the ppl know
Sen Franken proud to have you as one of my great MN Senators. thank you for your leadership
How about the U.S forces in Germany Dems & NATO surrounding Russia to start WW3
Thank you, Senator Franken!!
Thank you!!!!!
@SenatorLeahy @SenatorSessions @senjudiciary ROTFLMAO-What a hypocritical jerk you are.
Thank you Senator! Lead!! You have a majority supporting you!!!
it is almost 1a.m. here in Germany, staying awake to watch your incredible work today! Thank you
You are doing a great job today. No softballs for Sessions.  Are you going to bring up Sessions' ties to Brietbart as well?
You did an exemplary job in your questioning.  Your best work yet IMHO
Awesome job today, Senator!
