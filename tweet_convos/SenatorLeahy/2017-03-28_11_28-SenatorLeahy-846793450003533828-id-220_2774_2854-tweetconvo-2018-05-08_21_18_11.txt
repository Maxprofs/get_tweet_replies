The civilized world is watching in horror!
the rest of the civilised world knows climate change is real. They must think we're crazy.
#ClimateAction
They break the dumb ass regulations set every chance. They laugh at us but bcuz US spend
$ on hoax &bcuz we bring ppl 2US that want 2kill us
Did you you say that 97% of climate scientists want to kill us?
You need to wake up. Your NOT GOD SO DON'T TELL ANYONE. STOP DOING WHAT WERE DOING I WILL DRIVE MY CAR. YOU GO FLY A KITE
and when your governor is Nathan Deal, then what? Please tell me what else I can do. This is all just horrifying.
, don't give up! Keep showing your elected officials Georgians care about climate. Join the fight:
"Nevertheless she persisted!" I will write, fight & resist. It's just infuriating trying 2 deal w/those who refuse 2 listen.
BOYCOTT the Govenor's family business(es) & spread the word. It hurts their pockets but births clarity & change. Not easy BUT effective.
Keep fighting. Gotta put more money in the Clintons Obamas Kerrys Gores Soros pockets. They profit from every solar/wind generator.
And you were going to kill the coal miners and destroy their way of life.. Remember that blunder.
T-rump only cares about himself
should be studied carefully
l
This is what the environmental regulations DID! #45* has undone DECADES of good things!
LOL
Keep laughing gramps... Your grandkids will thank you...through their industrial strength respirators. Buh bye  troll.
GOD IS ALOT BETTER PERSON THEN ANYONE ON EARTH STOP PUTTING GOD IN YOUR FIGHTS. WE ALL HAVE FAULT WITH EARTH WE DON'T HAVE CLEAN AIR CARS
"could" in not a scientific term.
On the campaign trail nothing was said about the climate. How can you trust this woman who talk from both side of her mouth
the @usa after at least a century of being the most powerful country in the  has now become a HUGE joke w an  as @POTUS
MAGA: Start by traveling back in time. Who needs education, science and stuff? Coal rules the world.
Dwight what gives you the RIGHT TO CALL PEOPLE IDIOTS and tell US TO STOP DRIVING CARS AND FLYING PLANES WE NEED HORSES AND BUGGIES. I THINK
Nah, everything will be fine. You will have to perpetuate your "Climate Change" fraud somewhere else.
New EPA will drain the "global warming" "climate change" swamp! Sensibly USE our natural resources! But don't fall for the BS!
@TomSteyer I LOVE that Trump signed the EPA executive order rolling back obamas crap policies I am Proud of President Trump
Policies is all to hurt the middle and POOR class people rich people don't have to worry were there kids next meal coming from Bill paid
Yes, Obama policies hurt poor & middle class. Hillary would have been absolutely terrible for poor & middle class. I'm proud of Trump
Of course good! Who needs all thesebureaucrats, who just shove regulations down our throats. All CRAP.
Sadly, the IDIOTS running my state of Indiana are NOT going to listen!
you can start by working to REMOVE EVERY "trump" MEMBER OF CONGRESS in Indiana in 2018. Phone, letters to editors -
TEXT your zip code  - You will have all your reps names & phone numbers instantly!

Well sick people can't work
Congress is proof of that
That was a good one @andrerucker51
Just calling it like I see it
What about all the people that would become poor due to the cost of electricity over oil.
Quit bashing my President! U should learn to work WITH Americans, not against.  You lost, Hill - get over it!
bring back coal jobs to my community.
Sadly he's not telling coal folks truth about jobs. Mechanization, coal imports, clean fuel
@HamillHimself 
If we could only have F39s to run on coal...ah...
What Climate Change? - fake news. 60 degree in CHGO -Feb!
maybe like Papa time he's going to run the country off the force
Or pure distilled bullshit!
@realDonaldTrump @PMOIndia @sardanarohit One,Who Say"America 1st"&DareBoldly 2Save America4rm" IslamicTerrorists"Is Mr Trump
The math was wrong, global warming is a lie.
Great thing I have Cystic Fibrosis and Asthma.
these stats were actually analyzed and some debunked. Good job!
# alert, global climate change has already started, and already has momentum behind it. Changes should have started a long time ago
And i say to this... Never heard of it!
Not only dogged determination to help the old boys club,  persisting in refuting truth. We need civility and exchange of ideas.
The climate always changes how did the dinosaurs change theirs glaciers recede thats what they do you wont stop it not possible, arragonce
@realDonaldTrump Don't pollute the environment. We demand clean air &water. STOP undoing the great programs from Prez Obama. #fakepresident
This is the only reason I don't like Trump. Other than that he's gr8
I grew up in LA area w/smog alerts! NO GOING BACK!
This isn't about climate control, but people being controlled by global lunatics.Dems are frauds, war on coal helped Russia's economy.
Kill it ! C a nt happen fast enough ! Go Trump MAGA !!!
The keyword is COULD
You have absolutely no proof of you 90k number. Complete hysteria fear mongering
Go back into the woods @Hillaryclinton CRIMINAL!
Permanent Lies...
"Could" means we don't know.  How the hell do you get that number?  Meanwhile malaria "does" kill millions a year.
Ok very great for sitters ok explaintit why?we stand fo
Mrs. Clinton, there are those of us who know EVERYTHING about Agenda 2030. We are asking you to take your wealth and get out of our lives.
It's the new Republican health care system... Free asthma for all
It actually does not. Trying to instill fear. Waste of tax money. Attempting to secure future votes from environmental groups
funny how republicans will fight to the death for the rights of a baby in the womb but don't give a shit about them after they are born
Gutting the EPA is apparently what Trumps neaderthal supporters want.
Apparently Trump doesn't give a S#....t about our environment.  He sucks the big one!
Stop trusting anything from the foaming viros.
They lie.
A lot.
And most couldn't care less about the environment.
They just Hate The West.
Don't trust anyone or anything you hear. Only trust me?  Wow. The whole world agrees on this one thing.
On what one thing?
The whole world agrees on nothing.
Bullshit. I guess you would rather freeze to death in the dark?
And yet, the nearly 500k deaths a year from tobacco are just fine in your book? Oh that's right, it's a great tax revenue stream.
Horse manure the blooming flowers in your yard causes more problems power plants emissions is set by the EPA and it's very strict
3600 deaths mostly in KY and WV, I'm sure they are so proud of themselves. It's amazing how stupid they are!
Deniers have to breathe clean air & drink clean water too.
Even if one denies, you can still be a good steward for the Earth.
Get What Clueless! We already LOST our jobs! Hes Modifying not Eliminating! Only the Obama Over reactionary Policies! THNGS MUST CHANGE!


To all the Godless,happy NATIONAL FOOLS DAY,The fool says in his heart,"There is No God "there is none who does good. Ps14:1 #JESUS COMING
@HillaryClinton    *could *could *could
Here's one:  7 billion people *could die tomorrow from an asteroid.  #thankstrump #actnow
Some should miss in the other direction. Half too cold, half too hot but most of them pretty close. It's settled science right?
bull shit
How about we worry about killing American babies in abortion clinics in Planned Parenthood first!
@POTUS please do not destroy our World for the future generations!
We need to start looking at some of the policies before it is too late.
Trump's plan will create over six million jobs do your math
HRC IS A THREAT 2OUR CLIMATE & OUR COUNTRY.DO YOUR H,W, & SEE 4 YOURSELVES.

FUNNY THING,HRC talks about premature deaths,but its ok that in the USA ALONE,over 300,000 baby's were killed by Abortions--
you do realize the planet has been fixing itself for millions of years...its called #motherlynature
Mr President do u know how to read? Scientific research speaks for itself. Coal miners need to learn a new trade. Wake up!
He is so fricking brainless. My children and grandchildren are going to pay the price.
moved to NZ 22 yrs ago - tired of gagging on the streets of NYC - clean NOT dirty air #CleanGreenNZ!
Joke on hard core authoritarians; ideology hollow as his health care plan. Without liberals to attack, they have nothing.
@eyevanj75 trumpy is doing all of this to keep his friends rich and out of spite for #Obama
@EdHenderson12 What does terrorism have to do with climate change?
holy crap you just made up numbers from nowhere....
No doubt major democrat supporters.
actually it's the left wing liberals who are a threat to our health our jobs and our future!
liars!  Anything demoncrats say is #LIE
unreal. The United States of America willingly making its residents sick while aiding in killing the planet. All for $$$
not just asthma attacks but think about the people who have to clean Hazmat. Many are dead and some have had cancer...
@realDonaldTrump  Stop golfing and start doing your job.  Read and get educated for the sake of the world!
Gosh, I hope you all realized this is meant for t-Rumpus. My apology is you didn't. Sorry!
@JoyToy312 GOP do not ruin our beautiful country by polluting it for $$$
you lie just like the adjusted data the paid off scientist spewed
but what if my governor is an idiot with his head up trumps ass?
@karenmrevard
We need to stand for clean air and water.
your all idiots.  What he's doing is cutting the BS out to help bring back jobs.   That's all
lol!! Hey, i think they found Bigfoot too!
Two words, BULL SHIT.
lies, lies and more lies. #GFY @NextGenClimate
@POTUS What's fake about this? Backwards people making decisions about things that y know nothing about. ClownAss
Make America Degrade Again...
#KillingAmerica should become the new GOP motto, along with #PartybeforeAmerica
when you have an EPA director who says carbon dioxide doesn't contribute to climate change, should we expect anything less?
the left legalized weed...you directly inhale smoke in your lungs yet the left is silent. Fear mongering is all this is.
people don't only smoke it, ya know, so no argument about lungs and pot, please
That's Bull Shit! More Socialist propaganda to get power back.
Our GOP Governor @LarryHogan opposed investments in clean energy at state level. He will not survive 2018 in office.
I am so disappointed in this President's actions- not thinking for our citizens, the environment very sad!
Links to corroborate the claims
#alternativetaxes I would like to see people not paying federal taxes. Instead pay to programs trump kills 4 was &  wars.

Get your hybrid, plugin hybrid, or an EV.  And then get a green energy source. They only understand lost profit.
BS
Our lying cousin AlFraudGore & pals pocket padding scam. He tried selling his BS to family 1992
If you can read this post and still be a believer in the global warming scam, then you are an idiot.
https://realclimatescience.com/2017/03/1986-the-year-when-climate-fraud-reached-a-tipping-point/ … 
OMG this is so racist, What a bigot...Russians r coming...Life is over.  Calm down snowflakes and give each other a hug.
fake!
what on earth about such move from a so called developed country??
Told Gov. Scot-FL that even climate change-deniers can grasp-> COST-BENEFIT analysis DOESN'T SUPPORT Trump's EO to gut CPP.
Hillary doesn't beleive in climate change,as per her emails revealed by WikiLeaks,she's just paid to spew the lies& bullshit
the worlds gonna end
It's a money making scam and a way to stop capitalism by having no choices. It would also skyrocket our electric bills. (1)
Trumps want be happy until "the things they can't control" are w/o food, water, air, healthcare!
Why risk it?  You can find another job.  Good luck finding another earth.
@NYGovCuomo please fight the fdrl govt/protect air & water. They r accelerating climate chng. We c where it leads. Follow CA
you probably would like increase these numbers. Because the global warming nob heads claim humans are to blame for this hoax
Pro life POTUS Trump cuts regs that clean the air causing death to Americans. Sounds about right.
@GovChristie @CoryBooker Climate change is real - You need to fight for New Jersey to ensure we dont adopt any of trumps evil policies!
GOP doesn't care if a fetus dies as long as it's not at Planned Parenthood
Let's hear it for BLACK LUNG reappearance and pulling health care from the miners!
because only the US govt is capable of stopping emissions? What crap!
'could' lead to avalanches on Mars too but you don't have direct causation just scare numbers.
certainly you have evidence for these claims? Right?
Its the Mandella effect.
Being Coal Industry back? But wait, What about the reason it was stopped...BLACK LUNG!! Did they now forget?
many coal miners I know say the safety issues are horrible they continue to operate & just pay the fines..
Companies don't care because they want $.  Now No Fines-Gone.  It is Atrocious.
it's disgusting. And these coal miners. Who will take. Are of them when they r sick ?? NO ONE!!  SICK TRUMP
Is there a study or proof of these numbers? Not being cynical, but they seem arbitrary w/o attached documentation.
agreed! I'm all for the EPA but without documentation it falls on deaf ears. The word 'could' is weak.
America n China must comply with international regulations n policies about climate change issue for the future generations
SO KILL THE COUNTRY FOR A FEW JOBS
Not just to US. We're all in this world together
hey idiots where do you think the electricity came from to power your computers & smartphones! U using candles? #Coal !!!
not from coal
So how's the horse and buggy working out for you?
how can that not be enough for impeachment? He should be banned from Earth.
same guys who came out on the news admitting climate change a hoax
We confirmed we were "nutty" when Trump was voted into office! Now Trump wants us to cut our air with a knife and fork!
Trumps attempts to kill #CleanPowerPlan are going to kill us!
hey how you been
I've been okay. Thanks for asking.  What about yourself?  Are you doing okay?
pretty much I guess we're doing as well as anyone could do with Donald Trump as president scary
I can truly relate.
Trump actions are destructive, Earth is already showing many signs of worldwide climate change.
Stop Trump!!
Quote some actual scientifically verifiable data not 'could trigger' bs.
I tuned in to a BBC news program and they said "America is no longer a 21st Century country."  Let that sink in...
That statement was not because of Trump, but many previous Administrations and their wrongful ideology
8 years of a Marxist regime will do that look what its done for Cuba or the former soviet union
leave me of your bleeding heart liberal diatribe.
"'Clean coal' sounds like an oxymoron but so does 'President Trump.'" Thanks, @StephenAtHome
It's not really something that can be done. It sounds great, but not feasible.
....oh stop ...
The world, especially our allies, are wondering what has happened to America that we're letting Trump/Bannon dismantle our democracy.
Now with illegal DMV Lic, public transit use way down & congestion up 20% per Cal-trans data. China pollution real threat.
China is spending BILLIONS to convert to renewable energy and getting rid of coal. USA now going backwards.
Trump is using this issue get the Dems outraged & to focus on this rather than Russia. This EX order will never happen!
@JuddApatow Though the first to be effected will be coal miners who are Trumpers.  Tough call
We all know Trumps already under water. Will be fine day when southern WH is too
So much for eating the fish now. Out of our waters. This administration wants to kill us all off. 666 Kushner's address!!!!
NextGen Climate is a Group controlled by George Soros. Would not believe everything they claim. The climate will be ok.
@Wudaddy45
@realDonaldTrump @SenDeanHeller thanks trump we don't like fresh water, or fresh air. We will stay inside and drink soda
@realDonaldTrump  It shouldn't be so easy to kill the planet. We need better safeguards to protect us from idiotic tyrants.
I was on board with saving the environment but this is laughable scaremongering.
@HamillHimself be sure to get on a Jet Fuel Plane after driving a Gas Car to protest pushing the Carbon dioxide breath out.
Obummer was the job killer
This is the same administration that decided children weren't worth feeding either....
not that you care @realDonaldTrump...this is what #PresidentBannon isn't telling you!
*trump signs order that actually saves jobs* liberals: HES KILLING JOBS OMGGGG
@HamillHimself Not just USA. We all share the environment and his action threaten global reefs and environmental tourism.
Sacrifice EPA jobs to "bring back coal", way to go
black lung, smog, polluting the us.is not the way.but the rich will get richer.
Les électeurs américains ont fait le pire des choix dans le leadership de leur pays , dommage.
Don't blame me... I DIDN'T vote for trumpkauf!
