Show me where in the Constitution a refugee has the right to enter? #ACLU is wasting money and minds. again-VJ
It's illegal by act of Congress.
Nope. It's not. Google: The Immigration and Nationality Act (June 27 1952). It's not illegal. -VJ
Without googling, a law passed in 1965 supersedes a law passed in 1952.
Nope. Just because a law shares a similar name, doesn't mean it cancels it. -VJ
Any conflicting provisions are resolved in favor of the latter-passed law.
The latter passed law was used successfully to ban entry. -VJ
No modern president has enacted a sweeping ban like this. The courts will clear up your confusion.
THANK YOU DAVID and the ACLU! We are a country of immigrants and our country was founded on Freedom of Religion!
this is a fucking monstrous thing to say
its the truth. This "oh my god he said something offensive" bullshit has to stop.
how about the statistic invalidity the van is based on. Or the denial of basic humanity for victims of war
aw, I'm just kidding myself. I know this isn't about logic for you
Imagine that. ACLU and I in the same corner.
Good to have you aboard General Hayden!
is coddling ISIS causing emotional distress? fry in hell for what Merkel did.
Actually trumps plan helps isis
keep dreaming with that fakenews what a joke
Hey Hitler youth. Why did your fuhrer leave Saudi off the list
information on travelers is not forthcoming. Reading is fundamental
Then try reading the constitution
https://twitter.com/RealVinnieJames/status/825431533859328000 …
Why not fight 4 inhumane treatment of vets & mentally disabled?  Fighting for non-citizens?  Irrelevant.  Sad.
you can do both. Use the money from that fucking wall.
We're getting the wall, & Mexico's paying for it!  Why aren't the Saudis taking any of the refugees?
why is this option constantly ignored.  Why can we help all refugees with this option?
Saudi, Qatar...don't want them. That speaks volumes. Costs 10xs more 2 settle in USA!
name the Constitutional Amendment that gives foreigners the RIGHT to come here. I'll wait
they had visas meaning they were LEGALLY approved before they came. These arent regular refugees
that's not a Constitutional Right nice try though
those ancestral foreigners came without legal pre-approval as well :)
and without a commitment from Mohammed to kill you for being gay you're welcome
you're what's wrong with America.
not a liberal, but nice try. Let me fix your statement for you. 
You forgot to add "some" at the beginning.
and yes, you are part of the problem. Just bc SOME people do it doesn't justify your actions.
there's also a little hypocrisy in that, no? Calling out others for doing what you're doing as of right now?
Stop wasting our taxpayer dollars, asshats

Help the native #WorkingClass & #StrugglingMiddle instead.
Yes, I'm sure that's the chief goal of the Billionaires Cabinet  Club. #blindtothetruth
#Obama hurt the #StrugglingMiddle severely w/ #Obamacare's hidden taxes.

#Trump will roll back.
oh word? I'll get back to you when I get that sweet check in the mail! We'll have some beers!
Not how a hidden tax works, obviously.
E.g., my father's employer/union premium increased by 600%
Or perhaps we'll get the $ back this way. Oh, wait... http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/27/trumps-wall-could-cost-estimated-120-per-us-household.html?__source=Facebook …
1-#Obamacare cost my father an extra $400/mo; the cost of #TheWall pales.
It'll also create
2-jobs, so the money isn't a loss. Plus, there are ways to fund it like remit-
Yup protect the rights of non American citizens over American citizens. And you wonder why you lost Nov.8th
Say it louder for the folks in the back
The ACLU does not have achance in hell and they know it.
@FatimaBarkatula @ACLU @nytimes
How about the ACLU start doing more on Justice Reform- so we can hire more of own over-criminalized citizens?!
can't wait till you lose when someone cites the 1979 executive order that President Carter issued
Bring it, you Cultural Marxist Regressive Leftist Choad! UVA Law > Georgetown Law. 8 USC 1182. Deus Vult!
thank you sir..
Thank you so much Mr david
Ridiculous! America's civil rights apply to Americans not the world
 way to waste the $ from those suckers who donated.
Trump is going to be court a lot. Thanks ACLU!
now do you think when he signed the order he was worried about courts get real Trump could buy and sell you refugees
...to be followed by impeachment proceedings, let's hope?
Trump has united the decent silent
Liberal Americans

I think we need a new law that states if it's an executive order that executive must appear.
@Trumpbits @ACLU @nytimes FINALLY!! 
Oh America is just getting started. See ya in 2020 TRUMP 2020!!!
@JohnRSeydel @ACLU @nytimes thank you for supporting those who need it.
@buynoir @ACLU @nytimes Waist of time. Bush and Obama did it too. 100% Constitutional. Did you even read the EO?
That's President Trump to You!, and you have no case,So do your homework before U go screaming law suit, lol
@zombiRN @ACLU @nytimes someone needs to stop this mad man. Block every executive order. Lame duck better than dead duck.
up the aclu's a** we are done with lack of common sense go be a big brave man over there for a yr n come back
dishonest and unAmerican
No you won't. You can't file a lawsuit against a sitting President. End of story
@NormEisen @ACLU @nytimes if we don't stop @realDonaldTrump's judge appointments, lawsuits won't matter.
@NormEisen @ACLU @nytimes we have to impeach @realDonaldTrump before he appoints federal judges.
We learned from @nycsouthpaw that @StephenBannon behind this @DavidColeACLU @NormEisen @ACLU @nytimes @potus can say "I Tried!" when No Wall
That's president Trump! 
Thank you for fighting so hard @ACLU!
thank you, ACLU

you DAVID are a low life who could care less about our citizens and their safety ! You liberal :!()!?)
hey ACLU how come for 8 fucking years not a peep on the illegal executive orders that came from obama?
Can you sue Pres Trump Personally - That's a language he understands, I don't think he read what he signed
The protests at JFK airport have rec'd little to 0 press coverage.CNN & NY1 had min coverage. 0 coverage other networks
Other networks must be afraid of donny dump backlash which is why they aren't covering this HUGE protest that WORKED!!
I wonder when the last time the ACLU fed a hungry child or helped a homeless VET?
@lsarsour @ACLU @nytimes  SO!!!!!! LOON.
Thank you for the hard work you do every day to protect the rights of the people. Well done !!
#Greatest US by R. Trump
who gives trump the right to pass such orders? More than trump the ones who clapped at his signing should be sued!
terrorist countries!Where wereyou when San Bernadininowas attacked orthe clubin Orlando!No representation for their families!
and you haven't got a chance ! Out immigration laws are to protect our US citizens not immigrants coming from
@ubervaper @ACLU @nytimes thank you!
And then some. He wants to play!? Hmm.., lets go.
i remember visa gate case after screwed up visa bulletin. Will this case got any future
Need to seek an emergency TRO, this is having a huge, immediate impact.

interesting - what if you lose?  #precedent
Let the games begin
@quinnocallaghan I'm sorry I think the timer's going off, that's enough internet for one day, go do your fractions worksheet.
I can't imagine Americans letting this pass. If Congress will not defend our Constitution, the people will.
bla bla bla
I just made my first ever donation to @ACLU!
, good luck in Court Mr Cole. Just in case don't hold your breath
Yaaass!!! Keep the lawsuits coming. #NotMyPresident #POS #RESISTANCE
#its not Mr Trump. It's President Trump
boycott his business
Thank you! Canadians watch with concern, wishing only the best for our neighbours.
This is why I just taught my children that we'll be making sacrifices to give what $ we can to @ACLU. #NOTONOURWATCH
It is called "frivolous litigation".
On what grounds is your challenge?

thank you ACLU
please hurry

No you wont see him, you'll see the high powered attorney's chism
@SimmonsLaurie  See you in court? Arrest the motherfucker for animal abuse. For under age sexual assault. Fuck this guy up.
thank God!
glad the @aclu is keeping administration honest but it's President not Mr., did you call Obama Mr.?
@KatrinaNation @ACLU @nytimes If you aren't already a member of the ACLU...now's the time to join!
I hope Trump drowns in all these lawsuits! Keeping fighting the good fight, ACLU. <3
#RefugeesWelcome 
MT @DavidColeACLU: see you in court... ACLU files suit challenging Executive Order on refugees
https://nyti.ms/2jHS6tQ 
I have never hated someone as I hate @realDonaldTrump How could ANYONE have voted 4 him
@robreiner @seanhannity @oreillyfactor This is the kind of man who does that.
Confessed rapist, DNA proof
Yes!  Drown Adolf Trump & his Brown Shirts in lawsuits. Stand up to this insane bullshit!
anarchist attempt to further place this country in the toilet. See this for what it is.
go get 'em. Gave the ACLU $100 for the first time yesterday. Glad I did.
SORRY DAVE.. LOST CAUSE...GO PRES TRUMP....
-Pls do something that will stick legally...people are in the air-literally.
say hi to Peter eliasberg......LA....
Please donate to ACLU today... thank you for fighting the good fight. This ban is unAmerican.
Good luck with that! Ban ACLU!
"Why? These 'courts' think they have authority over me? I'm PotUS! Sad."
-- Trump
Nail his ass!
best of luck. Please keep us informed.
@MoveOn @ACLU @nytimes handcuff DJT, walk him out of WH so the world can see,"until we figure out what the hell is going on"!
@MoveOn @ACLU Your suit will go into the round file, along with all the other frivolous actions by communist front groups.
As Trump's act is unconstitutional, Trump is anti-American.
Bravo ACLU; This has to be unconstitutional.  Continually #resist as current @Potus has no regard for it
@MoveOn @ACLU @nytimes I wonder where all of the billionaire tech Giants are now? Thanks for not helping.
wish you good luck.
thx u @ACLU sending $$ now !
Yes!!!
@MoveOn @ACLU @nytimes hurrah!
@MoveOn @ACLU @nytimes as always, the lawyers will win. Such a waste
@MoveOn @ACLU Where are the demands for #Impeachment of @realDonaldTrump the 2nd coming of Hitler @TheDemocrats have no soul.
@AlbionAwakes @ACLU @nytimes does the @aclu really think the U.S. cannot determine who it lets into this country?
As it is clearly unconstitutional to deny entry to greencard holders, yes they can.
a) so green cards are irrevocable and b) is that the extent of the lawsuit?
Yes. Greencard holders are permanent US residents, paying US income taxes -including for THAT wall. LOL!
Sue Trump right on out of the White House.  He don't have a clue as how to run the United States.
thank you for your courage, from America the beautiful.  #MuslimBan
it's a discriminatory Executive Order. If these refugees claimed they were Christian, they'd be allowed entry.

Donate!
This is going to be an insanely busy 4 years for you guys. It'll be exhausting 'cause evil never sleeps.
Thank you for standing up.!! This is tragic. I am literally weeping.
@64Dmorales @ACLU @nytimes & We Will Be Right Beside Him My Friend! Oh Look These Poor Refugees https://twitter.com/rrich2312/status/825418425405104128 …
@me_brutally @DavidColeACLU @jimrecht @ACLU @nytimes ...like Affirmative action, the ACLU used to have a very valuable role. Did.
The Frenchwoman who told me that we americans  were blocked from living in  France  was practicing Buddhism in Beverly Hills privately.
@smidge001 Someone needs to do something there is already mass hysteria starting
You guys...are so leftist that you need a glass navel to see even marginally well the truth, GET THE FACTS 1st
In 1993 Americans were being blocked from getting  jobs in France
Could u also take the governments of Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen to Human Rights Court?
what do you suggest people do in the meantime? a prof at a US university is stuck in Canada
Good thing we can appeal this to SCOTUS! Oh right.... shit
Where was ACLU when Obama dropped bombs every 8 mins for 8 yrs creating these refugees?
non citizens have no protection under the Constitution.

Winning!

go to north korea and fight them will you, I'm sure the nk gov will tolerate you lawyers.
@AlsFastball @ACLU @nytimes are they blocking immigrants or illegal immigrants. Because there's a difference
Like the 
Jewish refugees the US turned away in 1939? #Shame
I think they're blocking everyone.
The law already backs the President's orders. You are wasting your time & money. Americans want protection.
Thank God!
Diversity = white genocide. Why only white countries have to have diversity?
Trump won't show up his interns handle the lightweight work.
Good luck making that stick - LOL
Obama banned refugees from Iraq for six months in 2011
There is precedent for this both from WWII and Iran Contra. You have no case.
The next refugee that commits a murder the ACLU should be held legally liable.
How can we support this? Financial donations to ACLU?
Good question Tori (a rockin former student of mine)! Support the @ACLU https://action.aclu.org/secure/donate-to-aclu …
@DrJenGunter @ACLU @nytimes David, what can we do to help the ACLU? Please share! This discrimination is unacceptable!
@arctichamster So we can bomb like crazy snd create refugees with no protest ....too little too late
Can't someone get a temporary block at least?
Remember the word "American" in ACLU!!
.@DavidColeACLU @ACLU @nytimes 

Remember, trump's family were once immigrants too. Somehow we didn't hold them back?
is it too late to revoke entry???
you are going to be busy
????
USA
@bannerite @ACLU @nytimes We all need to support ACLU with donations even if you can only afford $5 or $10 a month.
I stand with#ACLU for Human Rights!
??you going to represent them to
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS those words have become white noise to his ears.
HEROES!! 

DONATE TO THE ACLU NOW!

Take a number,it could be awhile. Trump needs to move the Oval Office to the nearest courthouse
See you there snowflake!
I was hoping they would do this!  Fantastic
High crimes & misdemeanors #ImpeachTrump
Just donated to @ACLU. We need people like you to fight this madness!
Good, especially given fact he omitted Saudi Arabia and other nations w more history but his business ties.
Take your communism and shove it. We know what your charter is.
LOL, keep that dream alive as it will help you get through the tough times coming ur way in the next 4 years.
The ACLU is a liberal funded watchdog. Duh they're going to TRY and sue Trump. They had lawsuits planned "in case" Trump won the election.
