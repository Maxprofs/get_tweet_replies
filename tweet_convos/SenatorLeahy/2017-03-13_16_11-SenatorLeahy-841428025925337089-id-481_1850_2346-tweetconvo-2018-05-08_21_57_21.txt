Really
More of your agitation propaganda. You and the RINOs have a lot more in common than you wish to admit! #phuqueupthecountry

there's more of us sweetie, a lot more of us!!  @TheDemocrats @justicedems @DemsAbroad

24 mil people losing insurance is roughly = to the population of:VT AL ND SD DE MT RI ME NH ID WV NE NM KS WY
**combined**.
That's because he is a soul less vile excuse of a man! Karma's going to make him her special bitch!
@SenSchumer losers
What % should the an American be paying in taxes (Fed,State,Local)? 20%,30%,40%,60%? What do you think?Isn't that your problem?
Ryan is a cheerleader for all things republican, no matter the cost. Aught to call his "health-care" bill the IDontCare bill.
Medicare for all in the USA
Ryan's goal is to line his and his rich friends pockets!  Screw the middle class and the poor!
Yep. Of course #QueenKillary would have done pretty much exactly the same thing.
Actually under Hillary we'd have single payer!
You can't really be that simple in the brain, can you? You think her owners would allow that?

Encouraging to know people won't have medicine and medical treatment - yay! 
/sarcasm
And they accused democrats of death panels. Such hypocritical as*holes!
He needs that smirk wiped off that smart alec face of his.
@SenSchumer You left out the part where the #CBO said people would be uninsured because they choose to.

What
Who voted this idiot into office!? More idiots?
That SOB Ryan is actually enjoying throwing people off their health insurance
Well he's rich so he doesn't need to worry. Right along with his other GOP buddies. 
yeah and we are paying for his and his family's  insurance plus his salary.
Who voted this idiot into office? More Idiots!
What a monster...
@SenSchumer The evil in your heart, shines on your face. "Feed the hungry, cloth the poor, etc."
Ryan is an evil liar.
did you read the whole thing
So he is excited that he is giving more to the wealthy and willing t o let the poor die?
Low rent monster. It's just a matter of time for him to wind up under   the bus. Could be Trump could be Dems, but he's going.
The at work.
I am completely disgusted by the turn our govt is taking. Rich will get richer and poor and sick will suffer more. It's horrific
@NewsOfMideast The face of the conservative man who is not afraid to pull the plug? On anyone's life.
Naturally there will be uninsured, but at least they would have a choice instead of being force fed under communism.
@nwfisch wrong...people are free to refuse coverage
When Ryan hears 24 Million uninsured, he physically looked ill, SWALLOWED HARD, said he was encouraged!Very unconf in the end
This is so sad! Is he the anti-Christ?
Is it just me or can you actually See his  soul shrinking-strangled by that smirk
why are Ryan/Pence/DeVos always smiling? I think their dogma makes them delusional-no kidding
he is AN A@S
Because they will be free and have a choice!

 #SchumerClowns and #Communists
You're being polite! I wonder if he'll be that smug when he gets thrown out of SoH role?
we should take away congress government provided heath insurance! It would open the door to greater choices on the free market!
The Speaker has been a liar since long before he became the Speaker! Evil and power hungry, too!
<--- they are such idiots...but, hey the people stayed home & allowed the trash to vote them in office!
@SenSchumer he really is Eddie Munster!  This is a travesty. Please vote this bill diwn
this whole idea from u is a joke I'm old & poor so I won't be covered u r no better than trump
somebody better slap that Ryan guy.. he seems confused
Prepare your grave....you ask for it, you got it!
Of course he is encouraged, ,lest money out by government, ,,more in their pockets and special projects, ,simple fact
@cgshort It us joke to PR because he doesn't have to worry about insurance we do. The AP lives are not a f****** joke. 2018
@SenSchumer huge disconnect between Ryan plan ACCESS and ACA COVERAGE
please fight for us, don't cave like you did the cabinet appointments... And Bernie
Guess he won't be Speaker much longer
That's one shit-eating grin on @SpeakerRyan's face.
@SenSchumer CBO has the same numbers as election polls. If yah don't know them make them up.
@PRyan WOW, your "Get Sick & Die" plan is real funny Ryan?
can I slap that grin off his face?  Mr I'm a Catholic Ryan!  Talk to the bishops.  What do they say!
we need to remove all Republican health care were paying for it their retirement plan too since they disrguard ours #healthcare
@SenSchumer Ryan is smiling and enjoying the thought of people losing their insurance. Kill off old and poor.
@SenSchumer oh you mean your 70yo ass will be able to opt out of prenatal care?  Duh!
Paul Ryan is pure evil! #RESIST
@SenSchumer November 4 2018 will resolve a lot of the issues we're having today we removed  majority of  Republicans from office
Ryan Needs to go!!
@SenSchumer Paul Ryan is paid and bought for by the insurance companies. He needs to be removed from office.
He has that smile on his face because now he will get those kickbacks he missed the last 7 yrs
look at Ryan don't you just want to smash him in the face
@RepNewhouse 
Are you listening?  Tell me you are not encouraged to support this bill!!
Smiles like the Cheshire Cat.
Bye bye Paul. Enjoy the ride to the basement.
Ryan smiles while elderly and the poor lose healthcare and his rich buddies get richer
hopefully the people of Wisconsin smarten up and remove that bum Ryan from office next time
@SenSchumer The REP base should be seeing this, so they can know who they elected. #SenateDems #resist keep fighting for us.
what happen when trump said no cuts to medicaid medicare big lier.
BY THEIR CHOICE! WHY DO YOU LIE. WHY DO YOU HATE FREEDOM. OH YAH COMMUNISTS
@SenSchumer @SpeakerRyan Ryan need to wipe that smirk off his face when putting lives at risk and/or even causing deaths!
@SenSchumer premiums and deductibles are so high makes the insured unable to get healthcare.
Get rid of freeloaders sovworking Americans can get healthcare.
@POTUS  I agree with you Dems on this one, Republicans can do a better job, include other options of savings
why not Paul Ryan is a democrat
Paul Ryan is an Ayn Rand-reading, crying-while-masturbating, cruel human being. He is what is wrong with America today 
he just smiles like yup screw them, my donors get a tax break so all is well!
@SenSchumer Explain! I heard many who forced now wouldn't take if they had the choice. Truth and details, please!
Republicans keep saying they're concerned about "care not coverage"-Someone please explain-How do you get care without coverage?
they're referring to fact that some docs don't accept Medicaid. All hospitals do though. They're exaggerating
We have a brain dead speaker who's also covering up for the president's involvement with Russia.
Schumer, just another senile old liberal who cannot be trusted, there is a need for term limits
@SenSchumer entire GOP is fos
@SenSchumer 
Ryan is a sycophant. So called Christian.
@MSignorile The man is a sociopath.
@chirprn  Ryan swallows
The smirk on his face says it all. He cares more about money than people's lives.  Can't be human, he has no heart #deathpanel
Paul Ryan, and the Republicans do not give shits about the poor or middle class.  Ya'll wanted Trump!
& @HouseDemocrats To all - nice job exposing the truth buried in the @GOP #lies about #Trumpcare! #voteblue #vote #TheResistance
 The White House is asking ppl 2 share their Obamacare/Trumpcare thoughts - let em know 
WH asking ppl 2share Obamacare "horror" stories BUT if ur story is you're horrified by Trumpcare let em know that 2⇒https://www.whitehouse.gov/obamacare-share-your-story?utm_source=email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=20170313_HEA_obamacare_share-your-story …
@SenSchumer wow did you take that out of context. Whatever works for your agenda I guess, Chuckie. Democrats, sheesh.
@SenSchumer This administration is everyone's nightmare, but Dem's backed A Female corrupt LOSER so this is the consequence.
You are incorrect - young males especially will not get insurance if given choice - if they marry and have kids then sign up
@AuntLulie This SOB is HAPPY about other people's misery. What in the HELL? #TrumpCare
HEY ERNIE! We gotta get the liar and his club members out of the WHITE HOUSE!
Ryan is turning out to be a bigger moron then the rest of the GOP, and I used to like him
Ryan doesn't care as long as he keeps his...
Did Paul Ryan turn into a Sith Lord when no one was looking? He used to be workout guy, now he's kill the poor guy? Why?
That creepy smile on his face. That's not the smile of a good, honest, decent person. Not encouraging.
@Arts4life6790 hes trying to spin it to look like a blessing another fake Christian
Exactly. He is a monster!
CBO report is smoke and mirrors. How do you accurately determine number of uninsured for a program that does not yet exist?
So @SpeakerRyan & the @GOP want Americans to die under #Trumpcare while their families get life-time healthcare. #VoteOrDie
@MAHAMOSA  unbelievable ignorant ! Does he have a conscience connected to his brain?
absolutely not most Republicans feel this way the lack of care 4 other  people there will suffer
@SpeakerRyan is a #FakeChristian #Lier
Stop all the talk just 2 plz UR constituents. This is a time of action.Time 2 stop fascism that is rolling through this country
@NaYaKnoMi someone needs to take Paul Ryan's smirk & gloat from that pathetic face
that's why the American people and senators and congressmen should Impeach Lying Cheater tweeting Trump.  Don't forget Ryan too
wow did he really give that  laughter after that question?....crazy
Is it just me or R there others who can't stand that self righteous phony Gomer grin etched into Ryans ugly mug?
Dem-ons Liars! We got your number . Just about all you say is the opposite and Or a lie!
What are you going to do to help the people?
I'm with you
@GOP @SpeakerRyan either GOP morally bankrupt or being played by Bannon. Or both. Either way people's lives at stake not cool
@SenSchumer The #GOP members don't care about anyone who isn't wealthy.  Poor, sick, elderly? Their solution:  just die already
@SenSchumer - who wouldn't be? Fabulous news about those savings, eh? More to spend on extra nukes, which we really need.

#Fuck #Liberals #EndObamacare #Now !!
It's #Trumpdontcare and #Ryandontgivashit
@SenSchumer   How can a man like Ryan with such power use it to hurt ppl.  He is a disgrace!
delusional? Or evil?
@TrumpTrashBags 
Speaks to how heartless @SpeakerRyan and  @HouseGOP  are. 
They truly DO NOT give a damn about working class.
Not the slightest bit. They hate anyone who doesn't give them money.
@SpeakerRyan will regret this.. He will remember this moment as the beginning of the end of his political career! #UniversalHealthCare
STEALING from the poor to give to the rich #mercycare #AHCA
@SpeakerRyan Ryan you are a despicable clown.  Can't wait to see you disappear into obscurity like Gingrich
@speakerryan Too polite to say what really think of this: You LIKE Americans being worse off w/ trumpcare. SHAME.
Ryan refuses to believe the facts. This is typical of this entire administration.
@SenSchumer Ryan is such a great catholic family man what a joke he is a self centered asshat with no moral compass sick
face it @SpeakerRyan should be voted out of office. Someone who cares about all Americans needs to replace him. What a Buffoon
@MSignorile deplorable .  #whitehouseperpwalk #resist #wtftheseguysareheartlesssoulessassholes
In fairness, he was probably encouraged because of the estimated 337B in savings... Still a rickface
Ryan killing Americans is thrilled with his Republican death panel law.
shameful.
of course they aren't in the "class" he represents or cares about. @GOP out of touch with America
Just look at Ryan's smirk, you taking this in trumpsters?
Ryan's a real winner. @SenateDems @MSignorile
@SenSchumer The word #weasel immediately comes to mind.
@SenSchumer I'm so glad I don't need gov for healthcare, yet.
As a Republican, I am now 'encouraged' that Paul Ryan will be unemployed soon for lying to me. Pissed in Tennessee.
@SenSchumer Why does @SpeakerRyan always look like he is smirking at us?! #staystrong #VOTE2018
And he calls himself a practicing Catholic? I do not think Pope Francis would agree. @SpeakerRyan
@dianez123 In fact, it gave me a chub.
Astounding!!!
Vote these "Encouraging" Maniacal Idiot out of office Dems need to stop being afraid of your own Shadow & tell these dodo's bye!
@SenSchumer @NancyPelosi out of pocket expenses weren't affordable. $5k deductible? Cheaper for me to pay penalty and dr myself
@SenSchumer @NancyPelosi when are the Dems going to stop lying to public, as cancer surv, i tried ACA, policy cheap but my out
Ryan should be the first one to sign up for it
Hey Paul - People before politics, right?
@SpeakerRyan is a wrinkly scrote! I am a taxpayer! I pay for his healthcare so he can tell ME I can do without?!? FU, Scrote!!
@SpeakerRyan Of course he's encouraged. His special interest group reaps big tax deduction. TrumpCare will be a DISASTER.
I always thought Ryan was sick evil & cruel. After viewing this I'm now sure. Pushing Genocide under #Trumpcare.
@SenSchumer I propose that Paul Ryan and Co. sign up for Trumpcare and forgo the ins they rcv on the backs of taxpayers.
@SenSchumer RYAN is a sorry sob,,,,, a dead man walking !!!!
he's such a tool!
that smirk on his face irks me. This shit isn't funny or anything to smile about
Kinda like to slap the taste out his mouth. Open hand, full force. Like his momma should have.
@realDonaldTrump I think water & streams important,but a pool a reservoir must b safe & without fraud.&any my biz there?
@SenSchumer Losing healthcare produces real suffering, misery, heartbreak and death. Stone cold Ryan and GOP just fine with that
