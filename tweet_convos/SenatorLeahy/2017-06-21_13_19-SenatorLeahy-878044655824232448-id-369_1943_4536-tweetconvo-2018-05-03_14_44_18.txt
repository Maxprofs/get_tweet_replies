What do you call a bill that will cause 23 million more people to be uninsured? MEAN.
What about a bill that guts Medicaid (which covers 1 in 5 adult women & pays for 1/2 of all births) to give tax breaks to richest few? MEAN.
What do you call a bill that defunds Planned Parenthood, which provides critical health services for millions of women? MEAN.
What do you call a bill that would reinstate annual and lifetime caps? MEAN.
I pledge to do everything I can to oppose the cruel Republican health care bill from passing the Senate, and I need you to do the same.
Damn! It's cruel to let people choose whether to purchase a commodity rather than force them to against their will. #HealthCare
We clearly disagree on the definition of 'commodity'. Do you have car insurance? That's the law too...
Are you allowed to shop for the best deal for your circumstances when purchasing car insurance? Don't be foolish, use the brain God gave you
Not good enough to just admit it's mean! Fix it!!!
As a United States Senator I appreciate your diplomatic tone--but say it with me now, EVIL! #GOPhealthcare
Actually the ACA is working nicely in places with the exchanges.

She is STRONG!
Downright hateful.
I see you are enjoying Independence Day Hoyt. 
2015 I had a laparoscopic ileocaecal and colorectal resection. Spent 5 days in semi-private hospital room. Bill: $0. I #Canada #HealthCare
No, it is not mean. It is NOT ACCEPTABLE. Let the pp stand up now and speak or we become a country that doesn't care. Crime will go up.
MeanCare! Not Healthcare! There's a difference!
or #TrumpDeathCare or just plain ole #DeathCare or #GOPDontCareCare
#meanCare @realDonaldTrump calls it that! So what gives? Thought everyone was getting the best ever? That's weird 
Yeah and 4 some of us old ones who just want 2 keep cooking and reading & thoroughly enjoying life
And Heartbreaking!  What am I suppose to tell my child when she wants to know why she can't have needed heart surgery to save her life?
Trump calls it "special"
We call it DASTARDLY
#NoTrumpcare
The technical term THEY used explaining THIS was "soft kill"&
TheyMADE a video
U*SHUD SEE IT
& TAKING OUTsick kids is ON Agenda in vid.
MEAN! 
What do u call a crooked Senator ?? Say it with me Al  Franken....
I don't understand why Republicans choose to hurt people in their effort to solve this problem. America needs a single-payer health care.
..Real mean!
That's why I call it the "Self-imposed Term Limits Bill."
It's more then mean it's criminal. Why is this clown still in office?
No is not enough.  What's your plan to get to #singlepayer?
Actually, as Senator Schumer said, this bill is meanER!  The meanest! Bigly mean.
Al - Mean is kinda wimpy. It's not the kind of word that wins elections
But at least Americans can quietly die broke while still clinching their guns!
I would say Obamacare was the mother of all B/c stripped protection for all the people that was actually paying for their insurance,unlike U
It's not simply mean. It's immoral and wrong. How many people will die because of this legislation?!
It's beyond mean, it's CONTEMPTIBLE, DIABOLICAL, DANGEROUS, DESPICABLE, VILE, VICIOUS, EVIL! May think they're winning, 
EVIL ALWAYS FAILS!
Wrong 4 letter word, @SenFranken Correct word is 'rape' America 2 provide tax cut 2 Koch brothers and 'kin.' Sad @SenMajLdr @SenTomCotton
Republican

MURDER.
If anyone dies due to the inaccessibility of proven treatment, we should be able to have them each charged with murder.
The Murder Bill.
I'd call it an abomination....
What do you call a health plan designed to make it unaffordable for the poor, the sick, the elderly? Genocide.
PS where were you? When Mitch had the resistance arrested?
say fiscal murder, its accurate
What do you call a bill with deductibles so high it's cheaper to pay the IRS fine. The ACA. You 2 are part of the problem. #termlimits
MEAN!
It's not "mean," it's downright diabolical. It is craven cruelty. This is the grim reaper cloaked in words.
Under the leadership of this President? I call it a MAGA shit show.
No Al,  the word you're searching for is "evil"
I call it #GOPkilledgrandma and the #GOPdontcare
Mean, nasty, greedy, corrupt...so many words.
I call it GOP hatecare
I think the proper word; Mr Senator; is inhumane. "mean" is mitigation of the shear cruelty of this "bill".
More like Gratuitously CRUEL!
Rule of law, human decency, and the constitutional ideals are a thing of the past. USA a fascist regime in all but name.
I know, Sad! 
Assinine TrumpedUp world.
Horrific beyond words.
They have balls to call it a "health care" bill.  Nothing in it will actually help a sick person.  Call it a tax relief bill for the wealthy
It's not just mean.  A better more descriptive word is IMMORAL.
No, Senator Al, it's Sadistic. Serial Killers. A friend of Genocide. But typically Rich Man cruelty. I hate this country. My 1st vote:Carter
Not mean enough for Rand Paul,Teddy Cruz and Mike Lee
I think you mean Douchey.
Commissars and pin-striped bosses role the dice
Any way they fall guess who gets to pay the price
Trading Obamacare for Meancare (or maybe Don'tcare)
worse - EVIL!
The question is what are we going to do about it? Suggestions???
Senator, while we agree with you we are tired of seeing our leadership tweet yet have no solution. "SAY IT WITH ME" fix it
Mean, mean, wicked, evil, selfish, NOT FOR THE PEOPLE. OH, THATS RIGHT, TRUMP & GOP (corp lovers) DON'T LIKE POOR PEOPLE!
I can't believe that anyone with a brain or soul would think this is a good bill
My granddaughter was born with a heart defect. What now?
More than Mean! Inhumane, Un-American,& the worse Greed by the 1%
You go Al! We ned you for truthful news!!
It's mean
Please keep fighting for healthcare for Americans!
What do you call @SenateMajLdr & @SpeakerRyan dragging  people OUT OF THEIR WHEELCHAIRS?
Elderly people in wheelchairs outside McConnell office are being forcibly removed/arrested for protesting Republicans #HealthcareBill. #BCRA 
we passed mean months ago, this is immoral
Mean
I call it crimes against humanity
I call it #WealthCare ... To hell with poor people, the 1%'ers deserve a BIG TAX CUT, Reverse Robin Hood: Steal from the Poor, Give to Rich
It's called capitalism! greed! republicanism! hate! despicable them,all of them! Thank God I live in a Democratic,Socialist Country now! 
Useless! Who the hell is going to pay a premium for healthcare with next to no benefits. Shame on you, McConnell
Mean and profit enhancing.
It's worse than mean.  It's downright...Republican.
To work together should be our common goal. I am a mother of a dead child, walk in my shoes for a day trump
What, no heart?! Poor @realDonaldTrump is going to be SAD
UK meaning of "mean" : stingy; US meaning of "mean" : cruel.  Both apply here.
Unfathomable
"MEAN" is not nearly strong enough. People are going to DIE. Call it what it is MURDER!
Is your base too dumbed down to be provided specifics to your opposition 2 #HealthcareBill? Apparently, "mean" they understand.
MEAN!
This isn't mean, it's inhumane & it is not American.  This is not how we do things here.  Maybe this is how they act in Russia but not here.
Inhuman. Un-American. Immoral. Disgraceful. Sad. Bigly.
Mean? Is that really what we r going with? Yes, I get I said it. But y not immoral? What about evil? Incompatible with Christianity/Judaism?
Thank you sen franken for fighting so hard against this atrocity of a healthcare bill!!
The GOP Healthcare bill should be called #CruelCare or #NoCareHealthcare bill
"BIGLY MEAN"
Not true. Stop spouting lies and alarming ppl.
call it trumpcare -
Time for "Bigly" marches on DC and at their homes, offices, etc. people better speak and speak loud.
Ty for opposing
Unthinkable
No I call it vicious & despicable. Only Republicans can care so little for the people they supposedly work for.
We need a stronger word. Mean is a 10 year old bully or middle school "cool kids". This is far more cruel & cunning.
GOP need to do some soul searching!!
If nothing else does, a Repub vote for this death warrant of a Health bill will highlight the selfish hatred their souls are wrapped in.
Unconscionable!
Yes, but worse it is stupid and self defeating to our country, world and future as a people.
I couldn't agree more. The GOP healthcare plan is incredibly mean.
As the father of a T1D I have a much harsher word.
Thank you! We need you to shout it from the rooftops! Also puts an impossible burden on older Americans
Not mean, malicious. But that may be too big of a word for you know who.
IMMORAL, SADISTIC,GREEDY,DISGRACEFUL..I could go on....
There's only three words to describe it; "Mean, mean, mean."
Don't call the Bill

How much of a "Christian" nation are we if we turn our eyes away and deny healthcare to the poor, the elderly, children?
A Reichwing orgasmic event.
Ryan and McConnell's mean dream come true
Or murder, perhaps...
When the orange leader of "mean" calls a bill mean, you KNOW it must be bad! #FightBack #Resist #ThanksAl

MEAN! HORRIBLE! ROTTEN
Mean doesn't even begin to cover it. I'm going with inhuman.
Mean! I say it: mean! Mean mean mean mean mean mean imeanmoral mean mean mean!

Cruel is the better word
they were on the right track with this but got derailed. The Real Story of Obamacare's Birth https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/the-real-story-of-obamacares-birth/397742/ â€¦
you call it rope and a hangmans noose to their political career.
DITTO !
genocide?
Respectfully, I find the term 'mean' to seem quite immature to describe the brevity and impact the healthcare bill will have.
Republican
Hey A$$Hol3 They dont have coverage now AHA is USELESS! I lost mine 2 years ago!
This is no democracy I recognise! Being English,  my knowledge of American government is sketchy but Trump's abuse of power opened my eyes!
What kind of coverage do the GOP politicians enjoy?
Trump Death Care Plan -trump death panel plan
It's beyond mean. For many--including folks with employer provided insurance--it would be deadly. #McConnellCare @allanbrauer
@FUNNAGAN MURDER!
Death Sentence.
..election hacked using Republican's 'Cloud' data. Kushner now wants Vets data 'Cloud' as well. STOP BEING BEHIND(smells treason/vets die)
"MEAN" DOESN'T CUT IT...SINISTER, EVIL, BARBARISM ARE CLOSER TO REALITY
Not only Mean,...Teaparty is down right heartless.  These people don't belong in government.
Please keep up the excellent work, Al and @amyklobuchar!! We need you to fight this more than ever!!
I call it #DEPLORABLE!
Have you seen the bill yet?  Just wondering.
Cold blooded. And they say they're prolife!
I call it viciously malicious.
My $44000 obamacare premiums are mean. Say it with me now. Al
Iam with you all the way!!!!!!!!

Mary-Beth will die because of lifetime cap and high risk pool http://tinyurl.com/n59gmwk  my vid has 5.5 mill views @LeonardLanceNJ7 Town Hall
I call it created by despicable republicans. And MEAN
Miserly. Pernicious. Parsimonious. Take your pick.
I could think of a few other words but they aren't words that can be used on TV.
Immoral and unnecessary. A miscarriage of governance.
Downright EVIL!
Unforgivably Mean. CRIMINAL LIARS
And #meanpeoplesuck
or more accurately for many, murder? people w/pre-existing conditions will die without coverage, everyone knows that
You call it trump's folly.
You're quoting @realDonaldTrump, right?   Even he didn't like the @HouseGOP bill.  He may not like the @GOPSenate version (if we see it)
Insanely cruel.
They want to replace Medicaid with Meanie-care! #StopMeanieCare
ACHA!

Have you even read the bill yet?
Enough w/ D's using subordinate adolescent language to describe R's. This is murderous, lethal, & demented. Call it what it is. A death bill
The seeds of revolution?
What do you call Seth Rich? #Murdered
It's called a "DEATH WARRANT!!"
Al Franken for President 2020. Knock this effing embarrassment on his ass.
So...where have you been re #SinglePayer?
It is damn evil and will be the death of myself and my partner I am pissed!!
Inhumane
