@SenatorLeahy he doesn't care #trumpdoesntcare #repugnicare #insuranceAgentOrange
Ryan did nothing to improve the program. He created loopholes for the rich leaving everyone else in the lurch. GREAT JOB RYAN
@SenatorLeahy designed to be. ;(
and cover fewer people. But that's how it goes right? If you're below 50k per year who cares, right?
@Amatonterias1 figures expected it nothing but personal politics be damned the American populace & our country kakistocrat
@Heretic_Soul @Mangel2020
@JJohnson2u #swampcare
-Trump protects his cronies at every turn while his brain dead supporters bury their heads in the sand. Pathetic!
@AltUSFWS  this way when people go bankrupt like the old days, Goldman Sachs will own everything
@CAPAction We need Medicare for all.
Yeah and Trump even promised that. Sigh. @csiswim @MikeGrunwald @CAPAction
Trumpcare? Oh come on, can't we please call it Drumpfcare?
It's a fitting name, it follows something noble, is full of crap, and doesn't deliver on it's promises.
@codykeenan Please don't call it Trumpcare, please.  Trump will always give lower to no taxes to the wealthy.
Medicare for everyone would save money and health care companies wd get behind it. Rich would have to pay more so won't happen
basically "Trumpcare" is a bottle of tylenol, a box of Benedryl, a bottle of Maalox & some Nyquil..
In other words if you need a kidney you can use a voucher to.......
well we know there's no health & wellness...because I mean look at Trump..he looks like penguin's understudy.
back to emergency care plan for low income folks
@AltUSFWS If we could $ healthcare ourselves, corps lose power. We could $ start our own businesses. It is to controll people
i expected this from shady gop and dt. #disgusting
me too
@RepDonBeyer did you Hines expect something else? Welcome to Trumpville. Hope it's a short visit.
Husband's employer dumped $7000K deductible on them under ACA on top of monthly premiums. We are willing to try something new
#SoylentGreenCare
@JesseLehrich STOP WITH THE "TRUMPCARE"! That's all this egomaniac needs!! 
@JesseLehrich just as he said all along
Of course. He's looking out for corporations, banks, and his rich buddies.
Who does this plan help?
@AltUSFWS Which is shocking 'cuz everything the @GOP has done so far has been designed for teh pepul 
don't forget killing new business. Disaster for middle-class self-employed.
@davidpsdem #SwampCare
@AltUSFWS so it's pretty much like the rest of his presidency so far?
@minotauresse I hope to be rich on Saturday. Buying Power ball tickets and crossing fingers.
@markos republicans are a disaster over and over and over
@hotelkeys 
And will cripple states already in budget trouble.
Medicare cuts.."age-based premium subsidies..may not provide as much assistance to people with low incomes"

Two words.. American Genocide
Don't forget failing to cover maternity, while cutting back access to birth control. Force America to breed again.
@JulianCastro You have it confused with Obamacare, as described....
but it will surely have some nifty slogans to obscure this reality:)
Please! Do not call it that! Repocare if you must call it anything...
@nycjim not eggsactly making the middle class great again, right?
@AltUSFWS #republican "health" plan as expected. Will fail if enacted. Isn't honest about financial rationing of care. #resist
You left out MAGA!
@asmith83 well i think that sums it up nicely
@nycjim silver lining: his base is old and poor
@MeaghanRSmith And larger amounts of bad debt for hospitals, which put them in danger of closing.
Higher extortion premiums, for sure.
@AltUSFWS so it should be maga for the 1%.
@RepDonBeyer
@SenatorLeahy so much winning I can't even stand it
shifting financial burden to middle class to finance tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations.
@andreastonez #trump
@brownsugar7878 "TrumpDontCare" #THERESISTANCE #RUSSIA
So win/win for Trump?
@RepDonBeyer don't call it trumpcare
@ChrisMegerian Is this the change Trump voters wanted?
We are all just cheap labor to the guys with all the money.
I believe that was the check list handed to the bill's authors.
Otherwise known as junk insurance.
Typical GOP.... raise taxes on the middle class so the top 1% don't have to pay any taxes.
Let's call it, 'TrumpDon'tCare'
I like DonaldDoc better as a name.
Finally! Trumpcare! Thank you for calling it what it is!
Other than that, it's great!!
@JulianCastro TrumpDoesntCare is what is should be called! #RepealAndReplaceRyan
They just wanted the repeal of anything with Obama in the name.
that is not the plan I read.....
If we knew how much #ObamaCare cost/subscriber, we might be able to make some judgment about cost/benefit of its replacement.
@codykeenan We have Bingo!
caps on treatment too.
@LK_Teacher if my deductible gets any higher, it will simply become a target suggestion
@codykeenan Incredible that his domestic policy could be even more catastrophically wrong-headed than his foreign policy.
No way Trump had anything to do with it. This is Paul Ryan all the way.
@WHDNYC Genius! They have managed to incorporate ALL of the @GOP fundamental principles in one bill!
in other words, exactly what we all thought it would be.
MAGA (joking)
