Terrifying how this fascist became the center of this corrupt government. He's pure evil.
@OhmsParty @ForeignPolicy This is illegal, right? When we suing?
@contenteddriver @ForeignPolicy Bannon needs an intervention! Look at him, for goodness sake!
I think this guy should work on political strategy--and nothing else.
We did not elect this gelatinous grift-weasel! He is successfully destroying America and must be stopped!

I want to know what the fucking plan is to stop this descent into fascism. Congress is powerless/complicit
, im of the mind they are complicit in this since sept 2016
@ReallyDontTrump @ForeignPolicy Thus no FOIA responses.
No records.
@DavidYankovich @ForeignPolicy When is this ok with congress! @SENATEGOP @SenSchumer
It's like a bad-boys club over there! WTF is going on? Bannon grabbed Conway's butt in public
.@HillaryClinton Who will save America from this fascist regime?
shadow govt in the WH. This cannot be allowed in USA.
@JustTrueBlue @ForeignPolicy This sounds straight out of Dick Cheney's playbook.
@abwhite7 @ForeignPolicy A Regular James Bond. ..Drunk Uncle Steve
@SenatorLeahy @ForeignPolicy Fake News 
Hilary's emails seem so trivial now.  Love the double standard that the GOP.
@SenatorLeahy @ForeignPolicy remember this he's a criminal.If you have a mother, it should worry you http://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000156-c3f8-dd14-abfe-fbfbbe310001 â€¦

@AltUSFWS @ForeignPolicy he looks like a walking heart attack
@adammarx13 @iamsambee so a Gestapo?
@Glinner @ForeignPolicy Is it me or does Steve Bannon look as if he enjoys  carlsberg super lager?
J,M&Joseph this has to STOP!
let's hope those Nixon tape recorders are still up and running.
@Glinner @ForeignPolicy Wonder where his email server is?

"Leave no paper trail" lesson 1 of the Mafia, and lesson 1 if you do things which should lead to impeachment.
@Me_lizbet @ForeignPolicy and we can equally blame the Republican congress for allowing this shit
Disgusting
Bannon and Trump are temporary.  We, the People, will stop them,
@rjhellhammer #ImpeachTrumpNow
Move along... nothing to see here.
Bannon should not have been allowed to step foot in the white house
And Erik Prince as an advisor.
@ChrisGorham @ForeignPolicy YEAH Bannon
Never a good idea to cosy up to a tyrant with egomaniacal tendencies.
He's compared himself to Thomas Cromell. Does he know what actually happened to Cromwell? A very sticky end!
Maybe Bannon will go when Trump gets jealous of all the attention he's getting!!
@MiaFarrow @ForeignPolicy Well,he doesn't look like he's going to live much longer
just a trail of empty jack daniels bottles
yup...
the guy has got to go.
fake news alert
<- delusional denier alert 
It's good that he's trying to protect our forests from clear-cutting.
I guess he learned a few things from the Nuremberg Trials?
@davidsirota Which means this guy can blackmail anyone he feels like much like Hoover did.
