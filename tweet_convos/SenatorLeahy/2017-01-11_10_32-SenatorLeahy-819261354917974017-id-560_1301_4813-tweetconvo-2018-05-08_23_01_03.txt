So far @repjohnlewis giving a melodramatic speech about civil rights movement. No mention of Jeff Sessions... @cspan
.@repjohnlewis testifies on Sen. #Sessions becoming Attorney General – LIVE online here: http://cs.pn/2ijwgP1  #Sessionshearing 
melodramatic? Try real life! This man has given his life fighting injustice. What have you done?
if giving a testimony against someone it's customary to mention the person you seek to indict.
he is at the testimony of Sessions, right. Trust it is relevant. Stop being ignorant
So you basically believe in c9ndemning someone based on their skin color? Hmmm.
let's be honest you won't believe anything Mr. Lewis says anyway...
Sessions I would research it. Maybe you should do research instead of just accepting.
Research how...Fox news?? Goodbye
you try being hosed, spit on, jailed for the color of your skin and see how you speak.
so it's ok to blame anyone who is white? Got it. Sounds pretty racist to me.
i did not say that and you know it. You want Sessions you will get him. You'll see
You pretry much implicated it. Bad things happen in AL= (white) Jeff Sessions fault. Shame on you!
@MichaelSkolnik @repjohnlewis. His testimony is so powerful
If you want a history lesson it is. Where was his question for Senator Session?
its testimony doesn't require question
Not supposed to be a Black history lesson.
and it wasnt
So Lewis is providing a history lesson. How about an intelligent question for Senator Sessions?
these r witness testimony. Not questioning. How abt you know what your talking abt before commenting.
I do, again this is NOT A HISTORY LESSON.
reading comprehension
Yes, you should work on that.
I watched this and so much respect for you Sir. Thank you.
Just  . . . #NationalTreasure and #Hero! Thank you for all you've done.

sorry excuse for a human. a shame to his race. open mouth, lies come out.
Oh look everybody . . . the #IgnorantRacist from Mississippi is trying to join the conversation and say words . . . #BlessHerHeart
TIME TO RETIRE LEWIS!!!!!!
SEE- YOU DIDN'T STOP IT. SESSIONS IS IN "THANK GOD"
everyone has to pay their tax bills on their homes! Did you pay your tax bill yet on your million dollar home? TAX SALE
is a hero and national treasure. I thank him for his service to our country.
what he did was 50 years ago. he may have been good then but he is a bitter old bigot now.
Rep. Lewis's opinion doesn't count.

Now Sessions is to blame for all racisms according to bigot lewis. but he does love the segregation of Black Caucuses
segregation is evil unless it's done by blacks.
I agree.They are so full of themselves they don't even see it.Ignorance,blindness equates to entitlement
So Sad!
Lewis  stuck in the past.  bitter old man. Repubs freed his grandparents so he turns democrat.traitor
Shame he doesn't remember that it was the Democrats who fought against them and the Republicans stood by them...
Bigotry is a garment that can be worn by any person or party & Sessions appears to require an extra large
lewis is the bigot racist. he hates sessions because he is white. period!!
Ignoramus
you forget that he walked hand in hand with you  across petty bridge in remembrance of bloody Sunday. a racist wont
If you are so proud of your accomplishments, why do you have such an angry, sour look on your face all the time
You are not helping the integrity of our country at all!!!
Thank You Rep. Lewis- our nations treasure- teach n speak to the world!
