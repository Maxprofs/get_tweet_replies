Pres. Trump is NOT 'muzzling' the press, the main stream media is spilling out false news stories !!!!!
This kind of comment causes more divide. Your words influence people in the wrong way. Speak in a positive manner.
McCain is a leftist agenda  republican. Trump's asking for honesty not a muzzle.Sadly media is controlled by higher agendas
hpw could u still think Trump is really asking for honesty?? He is manipulating, twisting, making up crap...
Trump isn't muzzling the press. He is telling them to write and tell the truth.
When ppl repeat what he says, he denies it. When confronted with his lies he calls foul...

the difference between them and Trump was they didn't want the truth to be known and Trump does
Like the terrorist attacks at Bowling Green, Atlanta, & most recently Sweden?
sweedens crime rate has spiked tremendously since the influx of Muslim refugees expecially in rape
Nice pivot, but that's not what Trump said at the rally. You started with how 'truthful' he is.
I never said how truthful he was, I was only stating a fact.
"they didn't want the truth to be known and Trump does" Your words, not mine.
and that is correct
MCCAIN is a complete moron. He's butt hurt.
Two words for John McCain..... "Term limits".
@SenatorLeahy Demagoguery & fear-mongering won't resolve ur globalist agenda. Where has Trump discussed legislation to muzzle?
All hail....his almighty Trump!
No ones saying to muzzle the press, we're asking for the press to tell the truth, the whole, no fabrications, no more lies
Trump is, essentially,  saying that, by asserting they r all liars & he alone can be trusted. Gaslighting.
Not sure what a 'nessage' is, but I do know he's LYING his ass off every time he flaps his gums!
So we are just supposed to sit and watch the media lie over and over again with their biased views? Dont think so!
Aha, another successful lobotomy. Hope you are recovering.
Why? Because I dont follow in the brainwashed footsteps of Liberals? Almost 20 fake stories in last 3 months.
you are braiwashed. To believe that the Donald, is after anything, but, more money.
get over your personal fight with trump, and do your job McCain
@SenJohnMcCain I respect the service but these public comments seem to be an effort to diminish support for President Trump
@SenatorLeahy @AP Thank you.  Constitution says freedom of the press
I feel like we r already there & it has just been 30 days. So depressing.
God bless you Senator McCain. Fight the good fight, I will stand with you. Semper Fi
McCain has lived off his Vietnam record for decades and there's no honor left. He's become a bitter, senile, mean sorehead.
@FOX10Phoenix @AP President Trump works for Gene Huber John McCain works for Ashton Kutchner any questions?
POTUS is doing his job, How about McCain you do yours, now there's a thought or join the Dum Dems
It's a Constitutional right.
That's nice.  Now stop talking and show some political results of the "resistance". @SenJohnMcCain  @AP_Politics @kelsey_snell
What "free press" John! Did you not pay attention to the election?
Nobody is muzzling the so called free press, they are being exposed as generators of fake news. Libyan genocide = fake news
Nobody is muzzling the so called free press, they are being exposed as generators of fake news. Iraq WMD's = fake news.
@KTLA @AP It's time for him to go home...he's list so much respect
Sour grapes , McCain. Get over the fact that you lost & Trump won!!
but the press is not "free" but working under some odd influence by @georgesoros.  It's obvious press is no longer objective.
The free press has become a dictator, They get back to reporting and both sides. No problem.
it's not being muzzled it's being held accountable for what it's reporting
McCain wants so badly 2 be relevant & the only way he can be is 2 disparage the Pres cuz fishwraps like urs will publish.
When you go overseas & disrespect your country you loose all previous respect for your military service. hero turn trader
Complaining about yellow journalism is NOT muzzling the press.
What "free press"? What freee preeeesss, what freeeeee preeeeesssss?  Just echoing back.
@FOX10Phoenix @AP he needs to either get to work to help to improve the lives of the American ppl or get out
@SenJohnMcCain knows that @POTUS is just asking for an honest press. It's about time someone called out the liberal press!
#wewantDemocracy
glad to see Republicans are starting to see Trump's plan.
free speech yes, not fake news.
If you are illegal then that's against the law. Period, end on discussion. STOP MUDDING THE WATERS!!!
There's a difference between a 'free press' and a 'politically biased corrupted, lying, propaganda publishing press' !
The message YOU and the media need to say is that we are a nation who WELCOMES everybody.
@FOX10Phoenix @AP we don't need John or the one sided press to run our gov.# Retired today McCain#
@Newseum @nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBSNews @CNN #Media Attn: Free Press It is your Duty & Responsibility to be Honest & Fair
Is John McCain the only Republican with a backbone?
"Dishonest Media" fails to honor & respect those that have risked everything for a "Free Press"
thank you for speaking out,  it is so important

Just a Reminder...What the "O" Admin did to the Press!
"@AP_Politics: McCain cautions against efforts to muzzle the free press, adding 'that's how dictators get started.'
http://apne.ws/2lWFdkv "
@FOX10Phoenix @AP @SenJohnMcCain. What an ambulance chaser (media hound) you are! POTUS & AMPPL ask for Honest & Fair News!
The press isn't being muzzled. But much of it isn't being believed. Supported Obama, opposes Trump. Not role of media.
@SenJohnMcCain You leave our shores & spew hateful speech undermining our @POTUS in front of our allies! #DISGRACE
say goodnight John
When has @POTUS tried to muzzle the press? #fakenews @SenJohnMcCain needs to grab the adult depends & retire 2 nursing home
huge difference between free Press and outright lying about issues.
Is free press and lying press the same?
And he votes for every nomination- lockstep with president and party!
@FOX10Phoenix @AP a free press or a fake press????

Holding the press accountable for their deliberate distortions and lies, isn't shutting the press down.
It strengthens the 1st amendment https://twitter.com/thehill/status/833053751632068610 …
wow finally he spunds sane again.
McCain is an old fool who never realized his dreams. Envious old fart being pushed to the sidelines kicking and screaming.
Not suppressing. It's calling them out and holding them accountable to REPORT NEWS, not MAKE NEWS.
Yes, free speech is a right, but lies for a political agenda don't belong in mainstream media news reports.
McCain spinning the message. It's about the lying press.
He is the one who asked for bombing of Serbian TV station 16 people dead No one bombed western media when they lied on Iraq
The same press that turned him into a senile old racist when running against Obama. The media is biased.
@FOX10Phoenix @AP NOBODY said ANYTHING about "muzzle" the press,inFACT WE WANT HONEST REPORTING NOT OPINIONS BASED IN LIES..
SHUT UP, your state of mind sucks, get real!
Traitor @SenJohnMcCain confronted about #USSLiberty cover-up & #media accomplices: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2d0CKXy8HQ&list=PL32A3140D59BF5772&feature=plpp_play_all … #Navy #Veterans
I guess we don't have a democracy. Press is PRO-DEM and clearly slanted. Return to democracy if press gets he'll out of way
that's why we have warned against putting the donald in the driving seat in the first place.
No one is 'muzzling' press; Prez is teaching consequences when they lie & misrepresent. @AP_Politics @AP @SenJohnMcCain @POTUS
but does nothing.
Press is very free, John - it just needs to grow up and tell the truth. @AP_Politics @AP
Mr. McCain suffers from SLS.. "Sore Loser Syndrome"
@KTLA @AP Dementia setting in?
@FOX10Phoenix @AP I felt like I had no choice than to vote for McCain. Now I wish I had not 
Ironic coming from a mini dictator who's met with Bakr al-Baghdadi & sold arms to ISIS!
Tell McCain when he finds a free press to let us know. We will read or look at it. Even AP is not totally free.
pure BS. How about you take in an immigrant to share with them support them bet you wont
Who exactly is shutting them down? Press has never been more free. They just don't want @realDonaldTrump to be free to respond.
@FOX10Phoenix @AP this man just sits around and corrects money terms we need terms
John McCain you are a true Patriot. Keep this administration honest.
- I'm sorry to be witnessing your undoing John! You need to secede from the Republican party.
this guy is why we neeed terms limits.
@KTLA Same #media which wouldn't mention why patriot confronted traitor @SenJohnMcCain in following vid
we the people just want an honest press, NO PROPAGANDA!! McCain is a senile pos that needs a dirt nap, traitor to USA
what a hater. Are you the Christian right or the warmongering right or just a deplorable.
who protects the ppl who depend on the press 2report actual news, but instead, we get partisan interpretation of the news?
McCain is off his rocker.
of course so they can continue to push false narritives 
.
Another #antidemocratic step toward #consolidationofpower. #russiagate #putinsplaybook #lies #trumpregrets #resist #chaos
Free Press has been killed by political correctness many year ago. Trump is bring freedom of speech back.
- Caution: When the Deep State and Media collude, we have 1984 on our doorsteps.
Free Press? Any press have freedom as the child to speak out: "But he(emperor) hasn't got anything on"?
PRESS CREATED SWAMP WALL! High Velocity TWITT Piarced WALL! PRESS NO NEEDED! WE TWITT NEWS! CF Managing Partner F&F CPAs
#fakenews claims are getting old.
He's old and senile
@FOX10Phoenix @AP too bad no one muzzles him - what a whiny loser
he should know. He hob bobs with the best!
@SenJohnMcCain needs 2 be muzzled. Bashing USA/ POTUS isn't  solution making u McCain part of the problem. Assist not resist
glad somebody is speaking out.
@FOX10Phoenix @AP sadly, it's no longer free press. It's biased and unethical press.
McCain has been in the game too long and is part of the problem.  . . Time for him to take his trophy and retire!
Nah, dictators get rid of anybody who crosses them.
@KTLA @AP I wouldn't be apposed to McCain being muzzled.
Then you are anti-American, anti-Constitution, and a fascist-in-training.
he's still relevant how?
free press and truthful press.  What we have is a press that doesn't practice journalism.
Is McCain still relevant?  Is he still a Senator??  Thanks, Arizona.  I thought you were smarter than that.
I quit support of McCain when he blamed Sarah Palin for losing his presidential bid
typical demi reaction it's always someone else's fault
@KTLA well , quit backing him, separate . I agree with ya , but you guys still support him in chambers. Your an American first!
https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-03-31/mccain-linked-nonprofit-received-1-million-from-saudi-arabia …
muzzling lies or muzzling the truth look at our tabloids in uk nonsense about McCanns
McCain is nothing but a globalist and war monger.
This swamp rat need to go first down that drain.
@SenJohnMcCain should have stood up long ago but put self and party before country.
They also get started by politicians willing to  say one thing to the press, while voting the party line

to all the "naysayers" of the press. Just where do you get your information from?
he needs to retire!
staying for the bennies...lol. He clearly has nothing to offer. Obstructionist at best. Such blather. .
ok globalist war criminal McCain 
free to speak the truth...fiction and outrageous story manufacturing isn't their area.  The Hollywood folk already got that
No worry POTUS just wants them to be responsible to the truth. Did not interpret his comments as muzzling .
people like you make gov. Unhealthy.
muzzle!! Really McCain! Your jealousy has been noted. You'll never be President, the people have rejected you, move on.
He will never get over that. Obama kicked his ass. Trump told him he is not a hero. Never live that down
what a ass'''''''''''''
well said @SenJohnMcCain
Yeah, & no one mention that guy in Germany who did the same thing, esp when they chant Luggenpresse just like him! #resist
he has lost it. Our press is not credible, hasn't been for a long while. Public is very aware. Not journalists, partisans.
The alt-right has brainwashed you. I expect you have Fox News on your TV and never change the channel.
good man
go John go!!! Keep fighting!!! We need true Patriots like you!!! Country before party 
Unless the party is the Democrat party, right? 8 years after Dems walked lockstep with Obama. Hypocrites!
thank you for being brave enough to speak up
calling the press the enemy of the American people is disgusting
@SenJohnMcCain healthy like a an accidental rocket injuring hundreds of your own? @reagansghost
If he knows when to shut up, then he is a wise man
not a muzzle just unbiased honesty
he's such an ass.
you should be careful . Trump's followers remind me of the early days of the third Reich. Cult of personality
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqrw2vIvBv0 …  the old fool got prank called.
true hero
shut up McCain. The liberal media is getting what they deserve.
#fakenews alert.  Trumps isn't silencing the press.  HE's merely asking them to tell the truth.  Ass hat MSM is a joke
probably a fake news article from the administration....Think about that. Nice way to prove a point
this guy had a trauma. poor guy
@KTLA @AP Yo! @MeghanMcCain?can you help us out with your pops. We do have free press???
@A Start supporting your president against press attacks rather than planting malicious thought in people's minds about him.
like the right did to President Obama? I have eyes and ears of my own. Right is just as biased.
@SenJohnMcCain Independent Investigation Committee.
For once I agree with McCain.
How surprising...
it's time to be another hero, and save America from this Trump disaster.
Never been on same page with JM's politics, but he is a patriot and sees what's happening.
@KTLA AP, you're the ones who falsely told us HRC had the nom b4 the Cal primary, then told us the national guard bs...
Press cannot be muzzled, no matter how much some may be pushing false reports. Whistleblowers need full protection. @POTUS
