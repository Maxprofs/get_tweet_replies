This alone should be disqualifying, just like climate science denial should be...
Strict curiosity but if it were true that climate change was overblown what would you do for work?
(ya see,  clean replenishing energy has a lot of benefits aside from climate)
Those just don't pay as well. I have a problem with saying deniers can't vote. Not denying
Hes avoiding direct question of US Senate hearing~apparently no citizen should be nervous about their own hearing
the little scumbag side stepped the question.  knows his new boss will fire him if he opens his mouth.
@DavidCornDC @SenatorLeahy   100% of dead democrats when questioned about illegal voting remained mute. Investigations cont.
@DavidCornDC @SenatorLeahy Dems have to vote NO on all of these clowns or get primaried.
Strategy: repeat the lie until it becomes true ... then get the voter suppression laws you crave so
yes and this is like the GOP Running down a very slippery slope to be part of the new Reich.
Sessions maintains the right to deny reality, as needed, in the job of AG
Refusing to answer a member of Congress while under oath seems disqualifying on its own.
Please do not confirm this man. He is not the right person to uphold the laws of the country. He is a racist
@DavidCornDC @SenatorLeahy@ChuckSchumer NobodyYouSillyEachStateDoesItTheirOwnWay And SomeStatesChangeThingsJustBeforeTheyVote USA
@StephanieAlana5 @SenatorLeahy wel @SallyQYates stood up for truth and justice!!
to important to overlook
@SenatorIsakson @sendavidperdue Don't support someone who refuses to dispute Trump's fraud claims despite the TRUTH Trump lying
it was a take-home exam and he says he hasn't studied?
Sessions is a slippery lawyer. Does Trump have a B list?
@SenatorIsakson @Perduesenate If voter fraud, find & prosecute! If not, call out Trump for lying. No middle ground on vote fraud.
translation: I will use this propaganda to suppress minority voters in the future.
@DavidCornDC @SenatorLeahy My fellow Americans we are F***ed.
@DavidCornDC @SenatorLeahy then the Senator should vote his conscience
many people are registered in more than 1 state including the Trumps Many in military
Pleading false ignorance as an avoidance mechanism sometimes registers as incompetence
@DavidCornDC @SenatorLeahy That's a "yes".
Implicit in this response is that he BELIEVES the there were illegal votes, he just doesn't "know how many" VOTE NO
Millions is not possible Nationwide a few hundred would be the worst case scenario
To be fair, Leahy could have provided him with a def. of unambiguous...And possibly no, as he seems unaccustomed to saying it.
@DavidCornDC @SenatorLeahy   Sessions states he will pursue every lead, claims they are digging up facts about dead voters
@DavidCornDC @SenatorLeahy to defy trump is to sign your own death warrant. Message sent message received.
@DavidCornDC @SenatorLeahy Dems must obstruct EVERYTHING going forward. NONE of this is business as usual. None. Of. It.
@DavidCornDC @SenatorLeahy sessions gave Carter page to trump .
Did Leahy go off on him (in a very senatorial way of course)?? Seem to be part of his portfolio, DOJ responsibilities 
@NormOrnstein @SenatorLeahy another spineless unprincipled crook. He's the guy at cocktail parties telling "funny" black jokes.
@chrislhayes if any Democrat vote for sessions they would have sold their soul to the devil
@joanwalsh @SenatorLeahy What a wuss.
@joanwalsh @SenatorLeahy He needs to get through with only GOP votes. All D's no down the line even if from a state Trump won!
i wonder how many he thinks voted illegally for trump, maybe russian first language
@Bencjacobs @SenatorLeahy 
Problem is it's not a lie
Leahy knows it
Verification results will be out in spring. Indeedy
@BeauWillimon @SenatorLeahy #StopSessions #StopPresidentBannon
@kevinddaly @SenatorLeahy Sessions is slimy.
Not a lie if no facts to the contrary. If investigated then we would know the truth. Absence of evidence not proof
No, but, language; that last sentence clearly indicates he does think some did vote illegally.
@joanwalsh @SenatorLeahy We need an AG that will push back, not keel over.
the worst part about this response is the assumption in the response that people voted illegally
Right?
Alabama enacted absurd voting obstacles such as closing motor vehicle offices in rural counties, which provide ID
.@SenatorLeahy is a very good man. He is strong and steady
@chrislhayes @SenatorLeahy @marcorubio and @SenBillNelson 
#NoOnSessions 
#NotoDictatorship
#Democracy!
@RonWyden @
Vote NO
"I do not know how many people illegally voted" is kinda telling though.
Ha-ha! Full investigation will come soon, be sure! #MAGA #DRainTheSwamp
Other nominees broke from Trump when in disagreement. Why wouldn't Sessions, unless in agreement, fearful or focused on power?
@chrislhayes This will be our atty general. That's scarier than Trump himself.
@chrislhayes @SenatorLeahy  Well #JeffSessions wouldn't a good AG be interested enough to ask Trump for his evidence? #Useless
ok so he's made it clear now he's Trump's boy,as if there was any doubt.The DOJ will NOT be much diff from Nixon's
@chrislhayes @SenatorLeahy   Sessions is so compromised, he shouldn't be nominated for dog catcher.
@dale_e_ho @SenatorLeahy I've got something that you would really appreciate. If no1 shows up my place win 5 minutes I may mind,,
@chrislhayes Sessions would be easier to demonize if he did look so much like Henry P. Gibson.
@chrislhayes @SenatorLeahy @SenateDems UNITE!!! VOTE AGAINST HIM!!!!
@chrislhayes @SenatorLeahy that's left narrative
So it appears @realDonaldTrump has been vindicated again& The Lame Stream Fake Media is wrong yet AGAIN! @Lrihendry @JrcheneyJohn @KNP2BP https://twitter.com/pastorbones/status/825347774992510980 â€¦
Trump MUST be impeached immediately! Firing legal investigations is dictatorship!
@chrislhayes @SenatorLeahy That's a YES for the record
@dale_e_ho @SenatorLeahy if help is not needed I will find another source to broadcast evidence to support reviews. Choice is us.
So he won't last long
@daveweigel @SenatorLeahy Yet note that his response presumes that people *did* vote illegally.
More study is needed into rantings from a lunatic.
At long last, Mr.  Sessions, do you have any dignity, or do you simply lust for power?
@daveweigel @SenatorLeahy Vote no to DOJ nominee.
@1982JJessin @SenatorLeahy Pretty much said there were illegal voters! Ugh!
Slimy, slithery, slippery, scummy.  Perfect for the swamp.
@daveweigel @SenatorLeahy read today's Washington post article all of trumps EO has sessions fingerprints
.@AriBerman @ASFried @SenatorLeahy Session's confirm hearing reminded me of Thomas's SCOTUS hearing when denied having ever thought abt Roe.
Cuz Sessions knows GOP SCOTUS Chief John Roberts lives to suppress the vote
sure, let's confirm this nut job
