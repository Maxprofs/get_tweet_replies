Those words are not exactly true. I’m not a trump fan but I do like things to be correct.
which part?
He doesn’t say directly others don’t. He mentions he was told others “may” not and  may not do both. U State he says obama didn’t.
Can you magine Melania hugging someone? I can't visualize it.
She seems so cold. Ice cold.
You obviously don't pay much attention.
Trump is delusional and suffers from an over exaggerated sense of self
How many soldiers died during Obamas presidency. How many photo ops does this photographer have? 1? How many did he call? Those are real tru
Calm down, Ivan.
The Obamas were the best!
FIRST OF ALL in photo form. Brilliant
45 just needs to shut up & sit down somewhere! Always take shots at President Obama & don't know what he talkin bout!
Trump is just using this argument to distract from why US soldiers in Niger. Best believe there is NO ISIS in Niger
Military hated Obama and love Trump
How I miss those days when we had a president with compassion, empathy, decency, intelligence, humanity, kindness, dignity, and competence!
Me too!
Four months and a form letter.
He never said that. He said he didn’t know if they made calls.
That is being both presidential & human. Both POTUS & FLOTUS are perfection.
And I don't see this tweet on Pete Souza's Twitter feed.  Did he delete?
Hey @POTUS not only can u not walk a mile in @POTUS44 shoes, but your feet are way too small to keep them on. @CNN @MSignorile
The lying is tiresome.
Let's not ignore Michelle. Look at her! Her and Jill Biden started Joining Forces
Thank you Pete!  Michael, why do we have to prove President Obama met with families of our fallen? The good in know this! GOs? Who cares?
Trump Lies again should the headline of this story
The go to headline EVERY day.
Oh look. It's how a president with decency and empathy conducts his administration. The GOP are beyond lost
That's why the military hated him.
Well someone called bc this family just didn't show up to the WhiteHouse !
That's a Medal of Honor.  The President ALWAYS does a ceremony to award it-and if the soldier died in service, the family members accept it.

well, that's one,lol
Photo Op They always liked Posing
Aka I have the damn receipts. Try me and I'll show and prove.
You can’t take a picture with a phone call
Technically, he's 43. Grover Cleveland was one person, not two people.
Well, sure, he met them in person. Looked family in the eye. Offered hugs. But did he call?
was sarcasm. it's hard to tell the diff between sarcasm and true stupidity nowadays i guess.
Photo shopped
Post #MedalOfHonor ceremony for ___________.
President and Mrs Obama. Nothing but class. They make me proud to have voted for him twice. Would do it again if I had the opportunity
Current pres just babbles on (like a fart) instead of carefully checking his facts especially on a sensitive topic as this one.
Yeah, he made calls but more importantly he made FACE TO FACE visits. Trump’s own wife won’t even hang with him
Have you not been paying attention? 45 would use this image as proof of his point since Obama is not on a phone here. Literal, not principle
I suppose an in person meeting isn’t really an impersonal phone call.
Trump can not do this.
- unless he can throw paper towels at them.
BAM! Pete did it again.
Trump is the biggest liar of the United States who loathes President Obama.  *UGH*
Great
Fact Checker @washingtonpost "could find no evidence that Obama's made contemporaneous calls..."  https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/10/16/trumps-claim-that-obama-didnt-make-calls-to-families-of-the-fallen/ …
@realDonaldTrump More evidence of your lie
A beautiful and sincere moment.
I watched that comment, and you are not stating the ENTIRE comment for the purpose of DIVISION and POLITICAL GAIN.
I love how he uses his photos for activism.
Somebody shove this in front of Orange Man today. He needs lessons on how to be human.
@realDonaldTrump this is what you've got to do Coward In Chief
Well we know one thing is true, @realDonaldTrump sure is #Winning at lying. #MAGA vote #BernieSanders2020
cc: @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
Trump is a liar by the TONS
Bigly has no humanity. He  can't even fake it. His delusion is total.
Trump loves to lie trump is insane!
Well, I say sarcastically, it's not a phone call!

Ok, I'm better now that I got that out of my system. Merci.
 damn those pesky facts again 
Well, this isn't a call...
Trump. Liar, liar pants on fire.
It's almost as if Obama took the matter very seriously.
Pete Souza should win a Nobel Prize for trolling
Yep, we need more like him.
#HowLong? can we keep @realDonaldTrump #LiarInchief Mr. #TheBuckStopsAnywhereButHere  as #POTUS? #TryTheTruthForAChange to #WeThePeople
Tky
This is some fine quality trolling.
I feel like we could all learn at the feet of this master.
In order to get him to do the right thing, someone must have told the dotard that Obama did not make calls.
This is categorically false! @PreetBharara talked with #LisaMonaco about these very difficult calls on the 2nd episode of his podcast.

But that's not a phone call.  FAKE NEWS!
Lol
Love Pete’s trolling...
Hope Pete can supply all & u can put together a montage that would be appropriate and stuff it in this liar's face, what went on in Niger?
At some point in your career, you need to start calling a lie as a lie.
Like your post! We would like to invite you to see a cartoon about Trump.
