Whenever something is odd and makes 0 sense, follow the money
@LeChatNoire4 @SenatorLeahy Can't Leverage An Honestly SOLVENT Person Esp One w/"Secrets">>It's Why GOP Isn't Able 2 Step Up Too
Think of the word "vested interest" and go from there
Leahy stop lying
.@jaketapper @SenatorLeahy Uou really should be asking that about Obama. Putin owned him for 8 years.
Russia doesn't have control over the admin. It has control over the press.
Objection. Leading question. Assumes facts not in evidence. ZERO evidence so far for "control". Jackass.
Why do ISIS ideas have such a hold over DemocrISIS Party?? #cathyGriffin #cnn #NeverOssoff #HoldGA6 #GA6
You may lose VT in the next election..
Because they are complicit.
It's complicated ....
Maybe to get some of that 15% of Rosneft oil that Putin is using to lure so many.That would payoff 45's Russians loans&make 45 a real B/aire
Essentially Trump knows so little about the world he is easily manipulated!
Then DO something!!!!!
Don't be so dramatic Jake lol hey kelly Anne he strikes again @KellyannePolls he IS  a joke! CNN FAKE NEWS JOKE THAT IS
Lol
They don't, that is the narrative you are endlessly beating at in a desperate attempt to make it stick. Get on with people's work.
Leahy? Hahahahahahahahaha
@kindred_kim @SenatorLeahy 
We call it treason. #theresistance
Pee tapes, banks, Russian mob in New York, loans. A few things i'm sure i'm missing a few.
Yes I am. I don't sit on any congressional committees. But thanks for asking.
How do you know they don't? I mean if you call someone out, shouldn't you make sure of ur basis of doing so?
You didn't answer my question tho. I can't do blah blah rants too. U asked me a question I answered. I asked you rambled.
Fuck..
Why does it have so much power over Republicans ?
Your denials of why lost the last election are going to cost you the mid terms as well. Keep it up!You left wing liberals crack me up! LMAO!
Please tell us jake? You seem to know all
#Evidence ? Jake, show us the EVIDENCE, not the GOSSIP, HEARSAY, and downright LIES.
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
That's the golden question Senator. It seems anyone who touches Trump turns Russian.
The liberals have the disease call RUSSIAPSYCOTHAPISM SYNDROME
Why does Russia have such control over cnn.
Because you think it does.
What control name one thing
The descent into madness continues...
2 words-Manchurian candidate
Yes, Obama was
Blackmail!
You know why...
Duh!! Bought and paid for it. Demand tax returns and debt obligations.
When does or did for that matter have such control over this admin??
And why do they all (GOP) act like it's okay?
Go play with KAthy in the Green mountains. Seriously Jake, when was this idiot last relevant?  I guess it is Friday.
And why doesn't the GOP Congress do anything about it?
Oil prices.
It does? Lol he is up there in age but is he getting confused or maybe he is speaking about the last admin. #fakenews
Because trump owes them billions and they have a pee tape.
Stop putting question marks at the end of ur headline Jake. It's like is @jaketapper a leftist commie?
Doesn't.
The only think I can see the Russians controlling is MSM and do nothing Dems
Good question, $$$ blackmail, praise of @POTUS & greed by kushner family which will be his ultimate undoing.
They have enough on him to have him impeached or perhaps sent to prison.

Why doesn't the Democrats wha ever one ounce of pride left ruled by lefty mobs and Obama's resist fund
Because Trump negotiated w Russia to steal the election in exchange for favorable treatment. Just say it!!!!
By this time you should know why #trump remains In power because of lack of #leadership by both #Democrats and #Republicans Time to grow up
Trump is compromised. That is why Trump has managed to insult every leader in the world EXCEPT PUTIN! Coincidence? I think not.
Really?? It's a Russian puppet show every time u speak
#TrumpPuppet
You two are not even news worthy. Wtf
trump owes big time money to russians
Control, is the millions of dollars the Clintons got paid by the Russian government. Then they got 20% of our Uranium, Sen. Leahy.  Problem?
and tapes of #dirtytrump
#moneymoneymoney
Senility
They do I think Russia has a hold of your mind lol
I’d argue the disastrous NATO relationship damage we recently witnessed answers the question. No one can be that accidentally clueless
You're watching too much CNN @SenatorLeahy
Trump is trying to fire the last of them as we speak. Thanks Obama!
Because they have something on him that could seriously hurt his standing as a American...that pretty much goes w/o saying, by his actions.
Leaky Leahy needs to provide evidence. Oh I forgot, democrats just spew hypocrisy and not facts.
We would all like to know!
Why did you vote for Obamacare? Single handily destroyed small businesses
Why are you quoting a senile old man and proven leaker?
These people are the walking dead. Fun to watch though.

I also hear a lot of you journalists are going to have every stone turned over in your life's can't wait to see what's in your closet
You people truly are demented this guy should be in a funny farm or something seriously and you guys keep playing along
did your sources provide evidence to support this claim?  Can you name one?? 
It seems Russia has more mouths to feed than we ever could of imagined.
I don't know, but we better be finding out. The Congress should be totally together on this. This is America
THAT is the ESSENTIAL question that must be asked repeatedly until an answer is found.  Thank you, Senator!
Answer is in front of you #Trump committed #Treason by allying our country's future for help from #Russia Do not believe anything by #Trump
Cnn dope
time to retire old timer
Because Republicans were also hacked only Russians are not releasing thru wikileaks yet. Russian pawns=GOP.
Bc of blackmail... http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/trump-administration-compounds-russia/amp …
It is called Banking.
It does not only in the Dems and their media .. shame
Becuse Jake you guys wont stop reporting on it
pee tapes. Pee tapes. Pee tapes!!!
maybe  hundreds of thousands RNC stolen unpublished emails? Idk but maybe Putin is not only blackmailing trump  but also @GOP leadership
Why does Hillary and the MSM have such control over YOU, @SenatorLeahy?
Senator Leahy, THAT is the big question!!Russia must have something catastrophic on DJT!
Gee, maybe someone - I don't know.... perhaps some member of Congress - should look into that.
What a joke
oh Senator, you know why...
When are you going to challenge these tin foil beanie types to produce evidence?
Senator Leahy is a NUT JOB!!
Ask president Bannon
Why do Democrats have such control over CNN?
That's the mystery of the decade
hmmm.
Why is .@SenatorLeahy in the Senate for 42 years ? A lifetime - get out already
More propaganda! What a bullstatement in the form of a question.
Sounds like Russia has control over Leahy. Russia is all the @DNC wants to talk about. You too Jake. Russia consumes all of your time. #MAGA
I ask myself that question everyday and USA is being run by Russia. People didn't elect Putin president in the USA
We know who controls you. You fraud talking to dishonest network.
Ok, duh?
Trumpsters,all he has to do is release his taxes and answer questions about Russia Many of you say u don't care Doesn't sound very Patriotic
why does CNN put stock in democratic talking points?
That is the question. Follow the $$$.
Why does @CNN @jaketapper let @SenatorLeahy air time to spout this nonsense. This man is a Senator?
#maybeavideo #money #maragulagarchipelago
The million dollar question.......
You are senile and it's time to go.
Why are you RTing garbage like that? I hope you are doing so to point out the idiocy. Or you could explain how a nonsecret meeting is news?
This just in: stuff happened!
Did you know that most Democrat Senators have met with foreign officials from Russia, China, Syria and Saudi Arabia?
I didn't know he was still alive
Next on CNN: Russia invented "Basket of Deplorables" to convince Americans that Hillary hated them.
That is the question that will supply all the answers

But this old white man we are ok listening too?
"That which can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence". Hitchins
All because Russia or some exposed dirty politicians. They didn't get that upset over deepthroat during the Nixon era they gave out awards
We already know the answer to that Senator Leahy! Mayflower hotel where the bargain was struck! Quid pro quo bank loans 4 sanctions/policy!
Guessing it's partly pay back for his win, a reflex to the flattery he finds so irresistible & a pee tape
Says who? You? @jaketapper @SenatorLeahy #fakenews
Where is the evidence it does?
BZZZT Question assumes facts not in evidence, attorney Leahy.
Because he's compromised! They have dirt on him, that once revealed, would explode bigly!
Why does the Media have so much control over the Democrat party? Answer.. Because the Media controls the liberal agenda in America today.
I think you Dems are obsessed with Russia.This propaganda was started by Clinton.Hippocratic Clinton is the one who sold uranium to Russia
key fact ignored in criticisms of Clinton’s supposed involvement in the deal is that the uranium was not — nor could it be — exported
No kidding that is why Clinton used a Canadian donor as an agent to get deal done
Because he has been doing business w Russia since 1987 and owes Putin billions of dollars?
What a shot...love it! Now....good Q....but its quite easy....REALLY
As with all things @realDonaldTrump Follow the $$$
You have to be joking right?
Follow the MONEY...old as sin
They don't.  Who is this fool?  Put a tin foil hat on him. 
Patrick Leahy is detached from reality. Either he is senile or being paid off by the Saudis.
Leahy is a mumbling drunk.  Figures Tapper would drag him out to prop up the #TrumpRussia nonsense.
Yes,why?
The dems are really playing a dangerous game with all this Russia nonsense.
Easy. Follow the money. That's one thing Trump has always been greedy for, but felt he never had enough of. That's all Trump ever lived for.
haha thts the million dollar question.Mayb it's similar 2 wht u do in Vegas stays in Vegas in this case Russia AJ
ONE GUESS! MONEY!
It obviously doesn't.  That's enquirer worthy reporting.
a: see 1993 Wu Tang song, "C.R.E.A.M."
Sir ---it looks like you all have Been drinking too much vodka. You, alt-left Dems & MSM need the Russian narrative ---it is all you have.
What does that even MEAN? 
Go leak some of your BS somewhere else you reliable leach on our tax dollars.
You could make an entire show of contradictory videos of Trumps changing positions ala unemployment numbers. Just a thought.
because bank loans, blackmail and the hubris of incompetent, greedy businessmen.
Russia lives rent-free in @SenatorLeahy s head.
Nursing home  and a reason why we need term limits in this country
Why does Russia have this much control over congress? Seems to be their only focus.
With good reason, it appears.
Better Q: Why does Russia have such control over the minds of the MSM & thus the narrative they spin whenever there's a lull in TrumpTweets?
Because it is all merely an unfortunate chain of coincidences, right?
why did @HillaryClinton give 25% of our Uranium to Russia & then surprise a big fat donation to the foundation?
key fact ignored in criticisms of Clinton’s supposed involvement in the deal is that the uranium was not — nor could it be —exported
That has been my question all along. To take it a step further, what is it with Trump and all things Russian?
WE THE PPL HAVE BEEN ASKING SINCE 2016!!'
No we havent

That's the million dollar question!!!
Money & blackmail.
Money money money
I actually heard the theme song to the Apprentice when I read your comment. :)
It's just a puzzlement.
.@SenatorLeahy: Why does Russia have ‘such control over this administration’?
http://cnn.it/2rATAgk   #TheLead
Simple. Greed.
It's fiction.
More important what are you going to do about it? GOP Government of Putin
poor pat
You dumbshits live in a fantasy world.
You didn't know that the #Russians killed the #Dinosaurs as well? #DemExit #VeryFakeNews
Why does the left have such control over the press?
Amen!
Does it?
Term limits!  There is a reason why this country needs term limits and fake Jake found it!
why do adult diapers have such control over your bowel movements?
Crazy
“@jaketapper: .@SenatorLeahy: Why does Russia have ‘such control over this administration’?
http://cnn.it/2rATAgk   #TheLead”
Because you Democrats refuse to accept defeat, need to find an excuse you put up the crappiest opponent to Trump
Cuz Trump owes Putin bigly for the election win #TrumpRussiaCoverUp #trumprussia
And he's not gunna pay them until someone explains exactly HOW they "gave him the win"!
The dnc needs to drop this russia bullshit already.  We get it, you need an excuse to why you lost to President PussyGrabber 
Oh, come on. They ran a criminal war mongering inauthentic harridan.
They don't. He is an idiot
I bet 45's  taxes could tell the story.
"You're the puppet" #DaftTrump
