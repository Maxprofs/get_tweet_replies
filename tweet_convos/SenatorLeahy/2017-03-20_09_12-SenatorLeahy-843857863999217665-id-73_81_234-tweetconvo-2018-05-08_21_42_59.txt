@SallySmith7920 No Senator..Judge Gorsuch needs to prove that he is #MerrickGarland. Any Dem that votes for him will be out.
tired of hearing about popular vote, look at demographics of those votes, HRC's majorities came from communities that are
I'd suggest he's stuck here. We don't even know if DT who is #UnderRussianCloud is legitimate office holder.
why, because you may not win if it had to go to the supreme court?? That's the problem you all lost your brain. Stuck onstupid
why don't we PAUSE the hearing until the FBI outcome?If trump is complicit then he should not put up a nom.Let's have #Garland
hearings til then
broke, bankrupt or in large amount of debt.  Look at counties and states that gave HRC greater than 51%. Trump beats her 2-1
If you allow Gorsuch to take the STOLEN SEAT that should belong to Merrick Garland, judiciary will be lost for a generation.NO
Great Judge. Easy decision to make. Stop stalling and obstructing the process. Get to work for the people, not your party.
So you mention the current litigation, and then say just generally. Stop wasting time.
Judges are NOT "checks" on the Executive Branch.  Judges are arbitrators of the law.  Leahy is making no sense.
@SenateDems 

Impossible 

Just say NO 

.
@JudiciaryDems 

That seat was stolen from us, the voters who reelected Obama. Shame on you.
@peoplefor Shd not be considered at all! Illegitimate for repubs not to have hearing for garland, & this pres is illegitimate.
@SallySmith7920 Rehnquist recused himself fron Nixon tapes decision. Any candidate should agree to this.
@SallySmith7920 no confirmation until investigation (independent) complete.
if his name isn't Garland, he doesn't belong there.
Every conservative hates women & minorities, and is for dirty air and dirty water. Next.
In other words, move on, so every other Dem Sens can ask the same questions over and over.
Oh yes, we all know DJT is crazy. Blah, Blah, Blah.
Buying votes, kinda like buying favors for donations and payments to spouses?
don't blame J Gorsuch for the Senate's failure regarding J Merrick. That's what the election was about. Do nothing Congress.
Like Democrat SCOTUS picks who vote based on what they think the law SHOULD be and not what the law IS?
just like sotomayor, kagan, breyer and ginsberg were independent check for Barry Obabma #NOT  #judicialacitivist #legislatefrombench
@JudiciaryDems FILLIBUSTER
@JudiciaryDems and also that he doesn't hate women or children with disabilities. Record is disturbing.
he can't prove that, as you outlined in your statement. gorsuch is a no go, senator.
NO Gorsuch !
#StolenSeat #StolenSeat #StolenSeat #StolenSeat #StolenSeat #StolenSeat #StolenSeat #StolenSeat #StolenSeat #StolenSeat
actually he doesn't have to prove shit... heard of the Harry Reid nuke option? watch as Mitch uses it... 51 mother f er 51
His record proves it. Confirm and move on. 5-year-olds behave better than your party.
Spoiler: he can't.
At this time #gorsuch is very likely under investigation as being compromised. That alone disqualifies him.
#GorsuchHearing Only 2 words needed Merrick Garland. Nothing more nothing less.
@SenateDems Pretty sure he's already established he is beyond reproach. Everybody but Ds have already stated such.
#Gorsuch needs to be some guy named Merrick Garland if he wants to be on the court.
.@SenatorLeahy Sir, truly - a Justice nominated by a President under investigation for collusion with Russia must not be confirmed.
@SenateDems He won't be. Obstruct.
I think we already know he won't be.
Under the United States Constitution "congress" is the "check" on the @POTUS. If you don't know that, resign now.
The judicial branch decides cases, period. It is not a legislative branch; it does not constrain the President.
@SenateDems #VoteNoGorsuch
must be senile. Nowhere in the US Constitution does it say that the judiciary is a "check" of any kind on the @POTUS
@SenateDems ask him about maternity benefits! He told a class that women were users!
we want a filibuster and complete opposition to #corporatecrony #Gorsuch @SenWhitehouse correct re: #corporateinfluence
impossible,  he will defend @realDonaldTrump illegal actions
...much like you demanded of #ElenaKagan 'n' #SoniaSotomayor?!?
Yea, right!
You're full'a SHIT!!
@SenateDems #NoSuchGorsuch!
u talking about the soon 2 be Pence admin? Maybe Ryan? Or maybe revote? #impeachtrump
@SenateDems idiots
Can we not stop the SCOTUS hearings given the ongoing FBI investigation into Trump campaign?
@Trumpnado2016 
No.
He can't be.
@SenateDems 
Gorsuch case history PROVES he is biased & cannot be Independent or impartial. Resounding NO to GORSUCH #SCOTUS
Didn't that pretty much happen when he was confirmed unanimously to the 10th Circuit in 2006?
He has already proven to be an extreme choice based on his record. Your vote must be a NO if you stand for human rights.
his record clearly shows an extreme activist judge.
why on earth is he getting hearings before Merrick Garland. This is an outrage and his nomination should be blocked.
Garland is illegitimate now, stop circle jerking
Unlesz it's an incompetent liberal administration. Then they're allowed free reign right?
NO, he should go home and no one appointed to SCOTUS until #russiagate investigation is completed.
Ask Mr. Madden. He'll tell you "no".
No. His nomination S/b blocked. #StolenSeat
he can't because he isn't!! #noUSSCvote
He shouldn't even be allowed a hearing, when Merrick Garland was denied.
Get over it. You lost so now do your job
Oh like Ginsburg? Laughable partisanship sir.
Independent like Ginsburg ok with you?
