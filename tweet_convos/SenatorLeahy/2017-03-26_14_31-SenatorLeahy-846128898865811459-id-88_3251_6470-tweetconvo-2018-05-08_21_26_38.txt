Laws signed by Trump

· Law allowing Mattis to be SecDef
· Laws rolling back Obama rules on stream protection + disclosures
· GAO Access Act
still didn't work out for Americans
Yes it did. In the end only a % of White Americans had more gripes than appreciation. That's not all Americans.
yes 3 million more votes but that came from mostly California and New York. They other 48 states went to Trump
U R guilty of saying certain votes matter more than others. That was one of BS's big probs. We saw him & I see you.
that doesn't make any sense. Because I said a fact doesn't mean it's BS. Explain how u see me?
BS for Bernie Sanders no pun intended
sorry I didn't vote for sanders or Trump. So maybe you shouldn't assume u know or see me
note: LAWS, not executive orders.
executive orders are law. Just like court rulings are, legislative law's actually the least common
yes, my point was that Obama had actually worked *with* people enough to have legislation be signed. he didn't have to resort to decree.
@JasonKander
@realDonaldTrump Interesting Trump has only signed items/remove protections/shortchange Americans/revoke liberties #TheResistance
Yes. It's easier to tear down than to build up. He's doing well on the tearing down part.
@urbanstomach he's busy!
yet the GOP argues that he overstepped his bounds. Okay, to make life better. Hmm.
@JoyAnnReid And not one of those laws aimed to pollute our air or water, eliminate health insurance, restrict our right to travel
Not one of those laws trample tribal sovereignty
?? The Dakota pipeline was all Obama. Are you cray?
Obama stopped it, remember?
he authorized it!Placed temp moratorium on it due to freezing temps &protest violence
@LeslieMarshall that's because Democrats didn't care about  $20 trillion in debt they helped create
tax payers paying for three locations NOT counting camp David,,,,,and the dems are at fault?
.@ddiamond @ZachTastic24 
as a friendly reminder, all the 'good' #Christian #GOP voted against the children's insurance 3x in a row.
please compare # of golf games & $$ spent on securing non-work locations.
Obama's first day on the golf course was April 26, 2009
Hope that's the anniversary of Trump's last day in office.
that Omnibus and Stimulus had a lot of stuff in it that People don't realize
they realize how big they were in terms of not just saving the economy but creating new Jobs
Well, in fairness, he had a Dem majority in House and Sen...oh, wait.
meanwhile @TomiLahren thinks 45 has done more than Obama did in 8 years 
@aj_mirabelle yeah you know a president that actually worked and was amazing
Well Trump pulled the horn on the Big Rig, so no worse than a draw at this point.
Why decry that a deranged incompetent president hasn't pushed more legislation?
Every idea of his is catastrophic
Did Obama sign those bills AFTER Congress passed them?
Um, that's the _only_ way that happens. (Maybe I'm misunderstanding your question ... .)
uh yeah, but Obama had it sooo easy! You try being a rich old white man who's had the advantage of systemic racism his whole life!
Laws TB repealed by Trump (hmmm)

· Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act
· SCHIP reauthorization
· DTV Delay Act
· Stimulus bill
· Omnibus
@GespenstOne78 A true President & patriot who cared about our country
@SenatorLeahy. The stim
I miss him.
Thank you Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid.
Could you also compare EO's and purposes between Obama and Trump.  Differential focus would be interesting perhaps.
@Insinuare promised 2close Holiday camp in Cuba took him 8 years. ExtraJudicial murder politic opponent just like Stalin & Trotsky
@JasonKander Obama is one intelligent man who is leaps and bounds in front of Cheeto.
@LOLGOP experience,  diligence, talented and a dedicated staff...u can get a lot don, despite obstructive gop.
@JoyAnnReid chasing chimpmunks while Trump slays dragons. U just don't get it. not as stupid as u believe
SCHIP was a GOP bill
Wrong! That's the bill Hillary helped push while she was FLOTUS. One of the co-authors of the plan was Sen Kennedy Dem
@MrJulieGoldman 45 has no idea what any of these laws means.He knows words like, wall, Obama, bad, rally,maybe repeal (doubt it)
#Winning

@ddiamond @ggindc
but how many golf rounds did Obama play!
@neeratanden Yeah, Obama did well at this point, but let's not jinx our luck that Trump has been such a failure so far.
@LOLGOP Look, those golf courses aren't going to golf themselves!  Didn't you get the info from Spicy?!  DT uses golf dif than BHO
@markos 3
@GetWisdomDude Uhm yeah he was actually doing his job
None brought job growth or better wages to Americans. Just more government
@jennybent yeah, sure, but what had he done for Russia at this point?
Obama had a real and credible presidency. Trump has a giant cluster fuck going on.
@bezumnayaga Gotta say tho, as greedy & malevolent as 45 is, it's in our favor that he's ineffectual and weak.
@JoyAnnReid @POTUS44 Thank you President Obama for all that you did during time of great crisis. I cannot imagine if that was now!
@Melmis One distinction? Obama actually WAS the President of the United States of America.
@Richard_Schiff Hmm....that would make it 5 - 0.
Trumps:
GOLF 
GOLF
TWEET
TWEET
GOLF 
GOLF
In other words, Obama did most of his damage by now.
@BarbinMD And Ryan said it's hard to become a governing party after 8 years in opposition. Turns out nihilism is not an agenda.
@markos Deathly sick of winning , back then
#somuchwinning
@JasonKander Trump play golf at his own course bill
@KaChadlib yes, but how many @TIME covers did he have?
@JasonKander Wait, so being president doesn't mean golfing every single weekend at properties you own? I'm so confused 
it's almost like he was prepared for the job and put in the work to get things done
@JasonKander During the Obama years Republicans were outraged he signed some EOs. At this point it's all they've got!! 
Worked hard. Got things done.
and since you are a shill for the left.... here is the truth for your readers to absorb
Laws signed by Obama vs Trump at the same point of their tenures (2009 vs 2017) courtesy of @ddiamond
didn't he also change the agreement to make the banks payback bailout m
you should follow with the awful executive orders Trump has signed, none of them positive
@EricLiptonNYT 
Much, much better than present orange man.
@waltb31 In the middle of a recession...makes it look easy...
@JoyAnnReid And the stimulus ended the Great Republican Recession &began our unprecedented job growth no one gives him credit for

Amazing what you can accomplish when youdon't play golf every weekend on the taxpayer's dime.  CC @realDonaldTrump
@neeratanden @ddiamond Obama failed his Nation
And who's FAULT MIGHT that BE???
@JoyAnnReid Wasn't there also a credit card holders rights reform early in 2009?
That was in May of 2009.
What do you expect from an eloquent, intelligent, knowledgeable, gentleman..
To be fair, Obama inherited a mess so he had to do a lot. 45 only needs to give back to the wealthy & corporate interests.
True.
Its an insult to even compare them. One was a great Pres. the other is a complete fool who can't get anything done.
yes,he was the best thing that ever happened to the Republicans.repubs have more power than ever.Thanks Obama 
Lol. They have majority but they couldn't pass a health care law....   Thanks Obama..
took Obama almost two years pass and pelosi still hasn't read it..Clinton couldn't pass it in the 90s..lol
Yep. I've read all 1220 pages as required by my job as a heart failure nurse.Glad I know the details
Puppets don't make good Presidents. #PutinsPuppet #TrumpRussia
shhh...we prefer it this way
@JoyAnnReid one guy was a President the other is a ratings magnet
Right here is Obamas legacy. Hes a fraud, check out brothers page @ObamaMalik Obamas REAL birth certificate
@JoyAnnReid You mean O actually achieved stuff? Almost forgot, after last 70 days, that this is what the prez is 'sposed to do.
@JoyAnnReid Lol, no comparison!!!  @BarackObama knows policy; knew he had no room for error as our 1st African-American @POTUS --
guess  u werent effected by SNAP cuts in 2014?? @ddiamond @JoyAnnReid @BarackObama @POTUS
@JoyAnnReid AND he read the bills he signed.
that stimulus Phil Obama joke was only 6% into structure it went to unions for the most part nice try
@JoyAnnReid these laws require intellect..rollbacks need only a pen and a photographer..go figure.
@JoyAnnReid that's more
@ How a real president worked vs chaos, blatant,willful ignorance
The true 'Art of the Deal'...
