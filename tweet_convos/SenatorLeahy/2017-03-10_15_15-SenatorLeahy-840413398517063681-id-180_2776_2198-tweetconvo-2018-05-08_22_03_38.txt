@mwyres @nytimes 

Well Rupert told Hannity who ordered Trump via the television.
While that may or may not be true, I'd rather see evidence than just simple assumption... #JustSaying
Oligarchs work in the dark. Rupert def wld have a toe in this. Tweeting my assumptions. 
Ok then...but we can't complain about fake news without evidence of our own...
Let's call it a working hypothesis then. 
Clinton did the same thing. Get a life.
well boohoohoo
Great! Now Fox, info wars and Breibart are making US policy!
Donald Trump is such an awful man and his followers make me feel ill...
@Timmbarton123T Investigating  Fox Fake News is a clear necessity. trump wanting to terminate such activity says volumes!
@FightingMad1 @nytimes sources say Hannity has been paid millions thru FOX news by Russian investors to feed disinformation
What a Psycho
our country is basically being ran by Fox news and Rupert Murdoch is really running the govt
@ndylan1 Of course this was done on a Friday.
This is beyond chilling.
He was asked by Trump to stay on but Trump fired him abruptly
@NikitaKitty   Nervous! "OK to investig every1 b us." What are YOU hiding? Preet hasn't disapp. U hv j moved up on th list.
@solutionary52 @nytimes
could be coincidence : when you have two loud mouths firing off stupidity at random : bound to co-incide eventually
Because that's how dictators roll.  Good times for his pals, just ask and they shall receive.
@kathlee68917199 @nytimes Corrupt government!!!
wow so did I ... I knew President Trump was listening 
@FightingMad1 - It may take some time, but all the crapola will come out.
...because #DonTheCon never has an original thought & depends on the warped opinions of fellow passengers on his delusional ship of fools 
May be typical new admin move done in completely incompetent manner. Smacks of retaliation. TM of Trump presidency
.@gabrielsherman @ACNewman Bummer for the other 45 USAs who had to be fired to cloak Trump's true intent.
it's frightens me to wonder what he's hiding. There is all kinds of ethics red flags being raised.
well, Trump loves fox news. According to him, they are one of the few real news shows. Meaning they praise him alot
I'm still trying to figure out why he hasn't been impeached yet.
They gut DEPT just as an investigation ensures! Coincidence I think not!
All a Joke  WAIT 2yrs EVERYONE Will be Screwd Then Maybe People will Be Quiet An Realize What the Hav Done.
this is really disgusting. Fox has their small hand ms wrapped around Trump's small hands now.
#Pravda
Example.
Facts are stubborn things. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_e5B0FkwmxM …
No fan of Trump, but every president asks the attorneys hired by their predecessor to resign.
No fan of Trump, but EVERY president has attorneys fired by their predecessor resign.
@mcbridetd @nytimes The president is terrified now. Worried about assassination. WH will become even more of a fortress.
@EricIdle      The Swamp is starting to swirl!!!!
They should all say no! Fight it
wow cant believe how many hands control the puppet #socalled45 @realDonaldTrump #PutinPuppet #hannitypuppet #altrightpuppet
Fo you like to call yourself a reporter with #Fakenews headlines like this tweet?
A letter to @jeffsessions from @JanetReno asking him to step down from @billclinton
@nytim Trump believes  Purging political appointees is a way to stop any investigations that might involve him or sidekicks
wait to they all purge his sorry  ass
@EricIdle zhohfxu
good to know who's in charge.
I happened to be watching Fox when Hannity made this comment . Boom...and Trump follows instructions
.@gabrielsherman .@crampell  Great! Now Sean Hannity is calling the shots instead of Steve Bannon. What a cartoon, dystopian nightmare.
God help us.
wow!
Beyond that, he's also looking into Kremlin/RUSmob/$laundering in NYC.
https://twitter.com/rkfatheree/status/824631591733489665 … @gabrielsherman @BeachPeanuts
It turns out the most powerful position in the world is @FoxNews anchor.
Hannity can go punch himself in the dick.
common with new administrations. Likely Hannity knew it was coming and used to seem more influential than he is
More Fake News from dying media outlet.
@SMShow @nytimes  Of Course! Afraid of what they'll find out about him & bring charges. He's going down on a worldwide stage
He took out Shelly Silver & Dean Skelos. Nailing Trump would complete the hat trick.
there should be laws preventing USA's from being fired for doing their job. donny firing people investigating donny
he is the target the other 45 are to make this somehow normal and not directed at the guy who can order search warrant
I recall another former president whose problems kicked into high gear when he fired a good lawyer.
The sound of his master's voice
BadBoy BadBoy @realDonaldTrump Whatcha Gonna Do When They Come For You for the Lies and Collusion? @gabrielsherman @nytimes @seanhannity
every admin does it, every time there is a new president. Yawn
@cody1mac @seanhannity Because Trump cannot think for himself, and defaults back to Hannity the Hack.  Pathetic
@SenatorLeahy Senator. That's politics!! Schumer and obstructionist Dems have taught Trump how politics works.
straight out of the Fascist playbook
Clinton gave a few weeks notice and let those on sensitive cases finish. Very different then "as of midnight you're gone".
if anyone else did it it would be called obstruction of justice! God help this country!
Crazy Trump
#FakeNews #MoreLies
@DoloresWells20 Fox News: Translation: biased, warped information used to promote a bigoted ALT point of view!
@JuddApatow @nytimes just like Clinton had 93 of 94 resign. Thoughts back then were....?
@EricIdle @nytimes Disgraceful but typical of Trump
@JuddApatow Feels so good!
I hope these fired DOJ prosecutors spill the beans on Trump/Russia
Journalists you need to report on this!
What about on going investigations including those of ppl involved with trump @funder @LouiseMensch @TeaPainUSA @sharondigi
@EricIdle @nytimes I remember hearing about some guy who got rid of people in one swoop - something about long knives?
@washingtonpost @amNewYork @AP ...> @SenJohnMcCain @SenJeffFlake @SenateGOP  It's apparent you are protecting evil.

doesn't MURDOCH also have #RUSSIANTIES @RepAdamSchiff @MaxineWaters
@Isilchaser Dont give Hannity credit 4 this! He's only interested in being in the spotlight! He's a slimeball!
Donald Trump is failing. I love it
crazy
Why are you intentionally misleading people?  This happens with every single administration, and you're twisting it into something else.
in every other case, attorneys stayed on until replacements were confirmed. Replacements not even nominated yet
fascist propaganda outlets (fox, breitbart, even bloggers) have total control of idiot trump.
There has to be about a thousand reasons 2 sue Sean "Hangem" Hannity; not surprised he's perpetuating the deep state conspcy
@BeSeriousUSA Not the 1st time DT has succumbed to power of suggestion. Handwave "This is not the HC plan u r looking for".
Of course.  Hannity is probably up to his ass in Russian something.  OK, maybe just vodka, but still.
The end is near.
@JuddApatow @nytimes this is common practice among new administrations, right? #cmonman
@JuddApatow Did he really say "purge"?  Have these morons never read a history book??
@BioAnnie1 @realDonaldTrump is a tool of @seanhannity SAD!
Good press to purge prosecutor, pay for play?
This is not feeling like democracy.  O was sane & right vilified him & this guy gets away with lying, unethical behavior.
I don't see a problem here.
@SenatorLeahy @nytimes  quid pro quo? Most crooked admin ever!
@joshtpm @nytimes More likely Hannity was told ahead of time by Trumpies what was being planned.
@sethmoulton A kernel of truth in lawyers asked to resign but overall Sherman's tweet a bit disingenuous
@johnb78 For once, the fake news outlet makes the real news.
@joshtpm @nytimes. I wonder if Bannon gets jealous when Sean puppeteers Trump
@SenatorLeahy Fascinating to see if the Trump admin can find 46 prosecutors devoid of integrity to fix things for them.
Nothing is ever exactly as it seems with this administration. #transparency #Trumprussia 
Follow the money.
MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
@joshtpm @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity Trump, Hannity is the last person you should listen to, your judgement is poor
@theonlyadult @nytimes who thinks the leaks will stop now? Who hopes they don't?
@joshtpm @nytimes #PresidentBannonhannity
Now it makes sense,but FIRING ALL OF THEM!IT will bite Trumpy in ass soon, cause FoxNews is goin down hill-oldppl!
And their followers will believe NASA took them to some new planet to rule and reign forever
Preet for President!
@morgfair can they sue him for wrongful dismissal?
@Kris_Sacrebleu @nytimes Some right wing talking heads tell them to do something & they do it. Gonna be a long 4yrs.
"President Bill Clinton, summarily fired all 93 U.S. Attorneys on a single day, 3/23/93." OMG...must have listened to HRC!
Did you object when Clinton fired 93 US Attorneys? @gabrielsherman @cphillip3
Or rather, Bannon did it.
@JulianCastro love it! How does your own party's medicine taste? Wash it down with some whine.
But isn't that what friends are for?
So Hannity and Bannon are now making our policy to match their Nazi dreams.
not really sure which one i hate more Sean or Donald!
thank you - now the sudden urgency makes sense
cnn reporting this too.
@JulianCastro INVESTIGATE
GOOD GOOD GOOD!! 
ROTFLMAO!! Trump sacks fake treasonous prosecutors because Fox said to!! Nothing to do with plan and precedent being set!
Don't you just love it? Don't let the door hit ya where the good lord split ya. 
Why do you have to lie? 
#journalismisdead >>>how very sad.
@rackintheresa @nytimes because Sessions would have known and here he goes again breaking the fkn law !
@rackintheresa @nytimes oh shit!! See I missed that part of the story! Ummmmmmmm does anyone on the Hill know that part ?
It's official!  MSM is worse than the National Enquirer.
https://twitter.com/nia4_trump/status/840311889657765888 …
all those Attorneys stayed on cases they were working until replacements were confirmed not told to get out by 5pm
BWAHAHAHAHAHA @seanhannity GEEEEZ SEAN I didn't know you were that INFLUENTIAL! Once again TROLLED BY THE DRIVE BY "MEDIA" 
Don't know which is scarier, Trump being Putin's puppet or Trump being Hannity's puppet.
If Trump is putin puppet then why is he putting pro arming Ukraine people in on national security
Bannon is really in charge of the U.S Presidency. America is officially stuck with a Russia-backed #Breitbart government.
Trump is purging anybody that could be independent or autonomous. He only wants "Yes Men" around him. @helensmomma @gabrielsherman
Gee, doesn't that sound familiar. 
It happens for both Dems and Repubs. The thing is DOJ must be made free of politics. @helensmomma @gabrielsherman
That’s hard to do. When DOJ was first formed, the Bar got involved to try to make it free of politics. @helensmomma @gabrielsherman
Where is the Bar now ? Also, for too long we accepted "one" U.S. Atty as enough to fight corruption. @helensmomma @gabrielsherman
One was obviously not enough. Preet shined, but did he reform DOJ so entire culture was free of politics ? @helensmomma @gabrielsherman
With all the corruption, too much for one man
Disingenuous. Purge is common with new administrations

@OjPats4 oh please please someone @FoxNews tell @realDonaldTrump to resign before he's impeached..
Can we please stop pretending that Murdoch family's @FoxNews thru @21CF is not an arm of Putin's state propananda machine
Lumpy is livin' the life
Well in that case, I demand Fox News purge Sean Hannity
@itsmikebivins Why would Trump want any Obama people in his administration? This should've happened weeks ago.
That's totally what happened! Sessions had his feet up on the desk & said "what a great idea!" 
You idiots are beyond parody
Is Hannity channeling Rupert?
Just like Bill Clinton fired all GOP AUSA appointees in 1993. Trump should have done this on day one.
@michele86455429 The NOOSE is starting to get real uncomfortable for Trump.
@daveweigel Gulp.
@michele86455429 @nytimes 
Hey ladies and gents can u spell Nazi ?
@daveweigel As I said the other day, Hannity loves fake news and doesn't want anyone to discover that. Not even Trump voters
big lie
@realDonaldTrump I guess @seanhannity handles domestic, Putin international, Flynn defense. U are the jobs prez!
son in law now seems to outrank secretary of state. Tillerson
This is incredibly misleading & dare I say dishonest (or least ignorant). Every President always asks US attorneys to resign
@thegarance @nytimes is Sean Hannity the real boss in the Trump administration I thought he was Propaganda Minister
Amongst many successes, he investigated corrupt contractor + got a $500 Million Dollar settlement for NYC.
@daveweigel along with 45 others but narrative
This happened with Clinton as well. Not unusual.
Fun fact via @PaulaReidCBS In March 1993 AG Janet Reno asked all US Attorneys to resign. One of them was Jeff Sessions. #History
agreed re: clinton. only thing different is that Bharara supposedly told by trump during a NYC mtg his job was safe.
He also busted Russian gambling ring back in the day running ops out of....you guessed it.....Trump Tower.
I imagine this was coming (I guess revenge for Clinton '93?), and Hannity glommed on to seem psychic/powerful.
So every prez since Reagan has been hell-bent on revenge? Don't get out much, huh? It's called business as usual.
