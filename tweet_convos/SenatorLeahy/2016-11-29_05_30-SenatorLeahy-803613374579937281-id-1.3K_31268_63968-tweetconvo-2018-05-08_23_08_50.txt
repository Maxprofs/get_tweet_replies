Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag - if they do, there must be consequences - perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!
Still a strange concept to worship a flag instead of the ideals it represents
And the Jehovah's Witnesses got Supreme Court to agree they shouldn't be forced to worship the flag.
Who'd have thought I would agree with them on a single topic
Here's why: http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1102008085 …
Still a lot has changed in the past 100 years since Hayes. The new religion is corporate money
What will 100 years from now look like in your opinion?
I may have a theory... mostly for the US
If humans are in charge indeed! But what if this is true: https://www.jw.org/en/bible-teachings/questions/what-gods-kingdom-will-do/ …
I agree, but apparently Hillary disagrees with U as she sponsored Flag Protection Act of 2005 while a Senator
She also disagrees with Trump as she isn't advocating for literal removal of our rights as US citizens over a piece of fabric.
Yeah Trump will soon lean how the Constitution works, but I still think he is "playing" everyone with outlandish tweets.
To be honest, that's what I'm worried about. I don't want a president that "plays" anyone using social media or outright lies.
So...U are saying no President sold lies to American's to get their programs passed? Really? 

If U want your Doc U can keep
never said that, All I said was that their methods didn't involve flagrant inflammatory comments and blatant lies in the public eye
I would disagree with your term "blatant lies"  

What level of lying should we tolerate from our President?
I personally can accept lies that "protect" in the sense of national security, white lies in a sense.
During prosperous times, no one gives about flags, just money. In lesser times people start worshipping flags.insane
@StephSimmons317 You sir, are a great American
as I read this to my husband I started to cry 
All my respect and love Mr. Takei
the original Pledge George. Do you still remember it?
@JonCozart @realDonaldTrump i mean, technically the proper way to dispose of a worn out flag is to burn it respectfully
@jumblejim Why don't we all just meet in Central Park for a nice round of fisticuffs and then get back to being Americans.
RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!
thank you for standing so firmly for individual freedom & autonomy
You are a brave American. A smashing actor,and if that little orange douche canoe trys that again your fans alone #willfight
So you'd literally die to let these immigrants burn your flag ????????????
i love you, George Takei. 
LOVE you.
that is all
sulu fan brother keep up health my man
lol you need to get a mean friend so you can learn what satire is
Hillary disagrees with you George.  She wrote a flag burning amendment.  She wants flag burners in jail.  You supported her.
brilliant. as always.
@realDonaldTrump So, someone who believes in not burning the flag have any less right to protected speech?
I wonder if he knows that Hillary was the one who introduced the legislation against burning the flag
Doesn't matter. That's lawful pursuit of legal change. But flag burning is currently protected. So says SCOTUS.
so is the Obamacare insurance tax :)
I see my evil plan is working :)
Are you all incapable of defending Trump directly? Seems like you can only respond to criticism by insulting Clinton/Obama.
Thank you
Amen, Brother. Well said.
.@GeorgeTakei Apart from the obvious, I find it scary that Trump thinks a year in jail & losing your citizenship are equivalent punishments.
-  READ and LEARN   DUMMIES   you are BEING PLAYED !   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_Protection_Act_of_2005 …
And I would oppose that too. Just because I disagree with Trump doesn't mean I think Hillary can do no wrong.
If that's a year in jail, what will you serve for your massive crimes orangeman?
@barbaraJean1980 intenment camp flag
Hey America
@GeorgeTakei is a true American patriot.
More patriotic than trump & trumpians!
#dotard
@realDonaldTrump  is two-faced and he'll  change his mind when it suits him  #LiarTrump  #RealityShow
go back to japan
Logged in twitter after years just to support this statement.
check out Turlane camp. They went to collage class and after the war they became teachers ahead of the war veterans
Burning is one of two proscribed methods for flag disposal. The other is burial and I won't let a flag rot. Trump is a moron.
@WentworthMiller @realDonaldTrump Trump is a shit monger with no concept of how the constitution works.
@realDonaldTrump  "... with liberty and justice for ALL."
if you get the point of burning your country's flag maybe a rethinking of countries is in order to somewhere you want to be.
thank you.
@mariahlian If you burn the American flag, move somewhere else, you will enjoy moving back and kissing that flag, stupid it is.
@TerryMatalas @realDonaldTrump oh Donald, pay your taxes.
do you really get that emotional @realDonaldTrump when seeing your flag ? Do you get religious when seeing a Bible ?
a flag means you're of a side..i like fireplaces, but i'm scared of free burning any witch.. thank you for sharing Mr Solo.. <3
One hell of a lot of people from kids to Grands pledged allegiance to our Flag every day, we Prayed too, loved both, still do!!
@StephenARhodes two words for you "Pearl Harbour" Charlie Chan.
@realDonaldTrump 
You figuratively burned the flag donaldtrump. Not something I'd do. I love my/our country more than you do.
 you. With you.
you for president 
"@rgladwell: @GeorgeTakei you for president "  I'll second that!
, you're both insane. 95% of what George posts is untrue
so you're saying he could win, like trump?
Well said @GeorgeTakei :) do you think  @realDonaldTrump has forgotten the 6 1/2 billion folk that are not USA citizens? Do we get jail too?
put this in reverse; do you think it's right to die defending the rights of extremes overseas burning it?
'in reverse'? Arse about tit more like. You haven't a clue what I'm talking about have you lol
Read the last sentence of GT before resorting to offensive remarks.
you reply to my tweet with some aggressive, irrelevant rubbish & expect me to be polite? Sod off.
aggressive? Irrelevant? Do you think it's right to die defending what these ppl do? Part of 6.5 billion
Better tell that to Hillary, since she sponsored a bill to make it a crime, @GeorgeTakei. 
#SelectiveOutrage
I pledged allegiance to the flag every morning inside an internment camp. I would never burn one, but I'd die to protect the right to do so. https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/803567993036754944 …
I want to bottle you and inhale you every morning.
@kristenschaaled @realDonaldTrump I also pledged allegiance. Where's the liberty and justice for all?
@realDonaldTrump but a homeless vet starting a fire to stay warm on same street gets arrested... No fux given by the leftists.
Agreed. Good thing the bill @HillaryClinton cosponsored in 2005 failed miserably. #NoDemsIsGoodDems
outstanding fantastic keep up the tradition people do not realize what it takes respect the country the flag
Not enough.
Your liberal god FDR put your people in the internment camps. Remember that.
george star trek is over. get usec to it. not much call for queer trekies these days
@bracketbriefer Burn those Damn MAGA hats instead. Alt-Right Ass said the may as well b swastikas. NAUSEATING! #HatBurning
@realDonaldTrump - Uncle George for POTUS! #Takei2020
It's a shame people hold the flag(a symbol) more sacred than the society based on freedom and equality.
@realDonaldTrump Very dramatic.. Even more dramatic than celebrities' commitment to leave US if DT elected.
sad thing is now I'm worried hell want to put you back in one ..after his flag comment
@chirprn Mr Takei I so wish ppl in gov't wld listen to you you have a totally different & valuable position to voice
Thank you from Michigan. Email elections@Michigan.gov. Trump is fighting it and its been pushed bk to Dec 6
you make the world a better place
@cherifromwv It's time to pass Hillary's flag bill from 2005
And who put you in that internment camp? Trump? Republicans? Or was it Democrats and FDR?
@realDonaldTrump
@TornadoKitten wonderful response, to life, to love!!#
@TornadoKitten
this is from someone who doesn't see his wife's plagiarism as wrong smh
Somehow I bet people do not know that ppl inside internment camps pledged allegiance! That's a loyalty!
We can absolutely agree on this point- Freedom of speech is for ALL speech, not just the speech we approve of-
@richardvanhook I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.Voltaire
Keeping it real.
@realDonaldTrump Well said Mr Takei.  So sorry you and your family had to endure such atrocities.
@realDonaldTrump  you can resolve this issue if you  make the US flag out of non-flammable materials Like the EU #electionover
if you want to burn the American flag consequence free, go to Iraq, I'm sure they'll join ya in a good ol fashioned flag burnin
@realDonaldTrump internment camps suck, but not as much as dying. Get over yourself Georgie Poo
@realDonaldTrump Let's see, Japanese bombed US at Pearl Harbor and inflicted death marches on enemies, yet U don't mention this
@realDonaldTrump     You Mr. Takei are a true leader, you think, you're articulate, compassionate and understanding
would be a much better prez than @realDonaldTrump
I served in the military and I didnt fight for no damn flag.
Would You be ok if someone burned the LGBT flag?
I respect you alot George for your work on Star Trek but burning the American flag is disrespectful.
@MichaelSkolnik @realDonaldTrump    https://youtu.be/ptQ89N5tVlA 
@IBD_ECarson @realDonaldTrump what a shame someone died for that flag
@RRhenaL @realDonaldTrump and let's us remember many good people have died protecting that right.  Constitution, read it
thank you.  Hope DT reads it and GETS it, fat chance.   How sad.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_German_Americans …
An internment camp set up by Democrats.
and I would support the manor woman with the extinguisher!
I wouldn't either, but we have the right to protest in such a manner. Once we lose our rights, we are no longer a Republic!!
@realDonaldTrump To dispose of an American flag, the proper method is to burn it...just saying! :)
Not me ! I would die trying to stop someone. Don't give us your lip service. Either your for the flag or against it !
yeah both @realDonaldTrump and @HillaryClinton are garbage... https://www.google.com/amp/philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2016/11/29/hillary-clinton-flag-burners/amp/?client=safari …
@AlexanderMcCoy4 @realDonaldTrump Seig Heil!!
You'd think if one person appreciated that the point of America is the right to act like an asshole, given his fans, it'd be DT
Why? Being in an internment camp, and gay in the 80s, I'd assume your only problem with burning the US flag would be dye fumes.
@SaraJBenincasa When Mein Trumph takes over I am debating turning my back on flag and anthem if he starts taking away rights
@SaraJBenincasa A. Flag is a piece of cloth but a symbol of freedom and fight for freedom including to burn it.
@AkilahObviously @realDonaldTrump 
love you heaps
, UR exceptionally good@being human. Please continue 2 do so, so eloquently, as a reminder 2 those who need it more than ever.
@chris_lohring So when he takes away my citizenship where do I go? Ireland? Cuba? UK?
Can I choose? 
I might be ok with this...
@Mikamouth @realDonaldTrump  The issue at Hampshire Coll is student burning the school's flag; they have no right to touch it.
And what about those that put the flag on their crotch and butt hole as in underwear
.@GeorgeTakei And a president who was a Democrat put you in that internment camp. I'm sure if he was a Republican you would mention his name
@rcallimachi Correct, this is mere property damage, more important to prevent burning each other
it was the Democrats that put the Japanese in the internment camps
@cosign4sarcasm @realDonaldTrump I'm glad  our fears of a Trump Presidency are  unfounded....
I'd be glad if they were.
I was being sarcastic.. It seems worse then original concerns ..
I know
@JonCozart @realDonaldTrump isn't trusted to ran his own @twitter account but #USA is okay huh?!?
@realDonaldTrump YOU TELL HIM GEORGE
Damn, George. You're at least 2 or 3 national treasures at this point.
+1.  Well said.
@realDonaldTrump Plus George our supply of flags is endless!
wow.  I never realized what interment camps were til this year.  I'm willing to fight to never have those for anyone again.
@therealzanetta @realDonaldTrump I'd rather burn the flag &protect the constitution,than to burn the constitution,&protect flag
@therealzanetta @realDonaldTrump You are wise George! School today @ assembly was loud and proud Pledge. Teach human value.
I'm sorry you had to do that. I had this same conversation while in Japan on deployment. I serve for that right. #freedom
@realDonaldTrump When an American flag becomes worn, faded, torn or soiled, it should be retired and replaced with a new flag.
There are several ways to respectfully dispose of the American flag  without showing disgrace. The most common
@rolandsmartin @realDonaldTrumpwhen the flag represent all I may give a damn my family SOME DIED/SERVED only to live in RACISM
@Jacopo_della_Q @realDonaldTrump OMG! What have we done? I fear the next 4 years!!
A true American.
no you wouldn't, grow up
@linneaheideart @realDonaldTrump No you wouldn't, you're just showing off.
you are a great American.
- while dying for the right to burn US flag recognize that they are not "protesters" but enemy hding flags of USSR PALESTINE...
@realDonaldTrump <3 u im wit u admire ur courage I wachd u wen I wuz litl girl I still admire u still u trecky
@rolandsmartin @realDonaldTrump 
Burning the flag is the way you are supposed to retire an old damaged flag. Please tell the orange conman.
Great! Would you die to protect the rights of a business owner if they declined to bake a cake for a gay wedding?

C'mon George, these types of sound bites are messy and don't fit neatly in the conservative bullshit ideology.
To display such patriotism after such vile abuse is what makes us true Americans. A lack of entitlement we should strive for.
Posting stuff against Trump as a way to stay relevant, your more desperate than Megyn Kelly.
Why does everything you post have to be about President Trump, your a has been and no one remembers you. #desperate
you make me gag....the only thing American  about that kind of thinking is the big American bucks you have made.
@Jodzio I wonder if Mr. Trump knows what an internment camp was. Keep fighting the good fight Mr. Takei--real American.
@realDonaldTrump Just because u are granted the liberty to do something doesn't make it a good idea.
Of course if free speech restrictions meant no more dumb tweets from Trump-it could be worth it.
@realDonaldTrump seriously Sulu... just go away already you crying liberal
Thanks for standing up for what's right!
But no issues with Hillary proposing the same thing in 2005? Hmmm...
and as a US Marine, I'd give my life to stop it...
did you learn anything today about your prejudices and bias?
@Scots_Geek  isn't that treason anyway.
@Scots_Geek @realDonaldTrump if u r a citizen of a country, isn't it bcoz u needed a better life. Why would u burn the flag
We need to overturn his election because he would like nothing more than to put all minority groups in internment camps.
It seems @GeorgeTakei that people get far more worked up over a fancy piece of colored cloth than they do over the injustices of the world
anyone who pledges allegiance too inanimate objects only pay allegiance to their own futility #humansfirst @GeorgeTakei
Hillary Clinton, in addition to supporting the party who put you in said camp, supported the Flag Protection Act of 2005.
@patrickharvie @realDonaldTrump

@Omundson I have a neighbor with a Confederate flag at the same level as an American flag. And a Trump flag. #somuchheadshaking
@tess_tess2 The Supreme Court ruled it legal in 2012, with Justice Scalia giving it the final vote to put it over the top.
I guess DT missed that.. not going to those security meetings and all!!
One correction, the ruling was in 1989.Justice Scalia commented on this in 2012  and agreed with it.

U probably know by now that your girl Hillary pushed for the same thing back in 2005.  Would you have the same rancor for her.?
@alfonslopeztena
@ishaantharoor @realDonaldTrump been there. utterly tragic. #Manzanar @CAParksNow
@GeorgeTakei
@TeamTrump "Made in China"
People who care about flags don't care about the people who live under it.
.@GeorgeTakei @realDonaldTrump right behind you, George. :)
Thanks for the retweet!
This just proves further that @realDonaldTrump just doesn't get it.  Good for you @GeorgeTakei
Thank use for your insight, wisdom and humor. You are quite special.
@rcallimachi @realDonaldTrump George, words we should defend as we would defend our flag. As one, so all.
@realDonaldTrump that is not a right, that is a travesty
Sounds like a dictator.
lol Democrats put you in that camp bro
Then why did you vote Hillary?  #hypocrite
@rcallimachi @realDonaldTrump God Bless You Mr. Takei. You are a national treasure.
where is your vitriol towards @HillaryClinton who sponsored a bill to criminalize this as well?
Burn OTHER things besides the American flag There can be "limits" to free "speech". What do you think?
Pathological
And that is the one time a flag burning protest would seem appropriate.
Yet another demonstration of what Donald Trump doesn't understand about the Constitution and the Supreme Court.
Which makes you the true upholder of American values, not the guy who trample on the First Amendment.
It's disrespectful to our men & woman who have kept this country free & safe.  Supreme court 1989 should be overturned!
we got bigger problems
Much bigger! @GeorgeTakei
@MitchBenn @realDonaldTrump

When I learned about the camps. I felt proud that the world had moved past that bullshit.
@RJonesUX @realDonaldTrump you don't need to die George. Supreme Court has protected your right to burn all the flags you want.
@realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump & I had family murdered in concentration camps where OUR flag flew over  liberated camps. Go scratch George.
Craig Brockman! Thank you for your service and everything you do! God bless you for every
idiot
.@GeorgeTakei did you see this from the hypocrite @realDonaldTrump ? all he does is lie it seems.
@IdealsWin That's because you understand Freedom of Speech, George, unlike our soon to be Dictator in Chief. "God" help us all.
Thank you for the very rational response and reminder of how quickly a country can turn on its own citizens.
Can only imagine how chilling & frightening Trump's rhetoric must be to those who remember WWII firsthand @GeorgeTakei
Didn't realise till I read that tweet.
I saw him posting about internment camps but didn't click until that tweet but of course he's of the age that would have been
Amazing link from what seems like another age.
absolutely! Also any help counts everyone!
@HelloKittyRicki I agree with deing for the right to free speech tho so would I but speech is not burning something you uphold
