Why are you people obsessed with Soros? What about Koch? What about Adelson?
I have not seen evidence of those things--and believe me, I have read and looked. No links, please.
I've watched it already. Look,  big money in politics is always bad. Soros is no worse than the others.
The press needs to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth! Not fake BS they make up!
I'm all FOR freedom of the Press...it's the FAKE press I denounce.
do you think the president should tell you which media to trust? he only likes flattering coverage.
a free press isnt free from criticism.@SenJohnMcCain should be smarter; like PDT, MSM cheered him in prim, ruined in general.
but you still voted for all his cabinet nominees so I guess we are confused Senator 
Not confusing at all. He can confirm nominees while still opposing Trumps views on media.
How so? If you agree/disagree with one of his views, you have to agree/disagree with all of them? That's kinda dumb
In other words, quit trying to change your view with logic. That's healthy.
#trump banned the media. #WhatAreYouPreparedToDoAboutIt @SenSchumer @funder @Lawrence @SenSanders @puppymnkey
@POTUS @SenJohnMcCain "Fake News" asking a "Fake Hero"; a Treasonous individual, about in the SOROS pocket news? Priceless!!
The press needs to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth! Not fake BS they make up!
Who the hell believes a spoiled Milk toast Draft Dodger kissin Russian Terrorist Putins Ass for his win? @realDonaldTrump ! Eisenhower would shoot? over a Veteran Eisenhower would be proud to know John McCain.
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain I agree with defending the press, but not agenda driven propagandist which has taken over @CNN
says mavericky things but votes very un-mavericky
McCain is a Demt in a Rep mask.but he gets more FaceTime on TV that way.
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain Is Sen McCain the only Republican in office that grew a pair?
Good Dam McCain never once called Obama a Dictator when he went after FNC/Rosen...#EpicFail #EPIC
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain McCain is a disgrace & a traitor. We the People do not need ur kind in DC.
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain freedom of the PRESS does NOT mean freedom from criticism. As for McCain, does anybody like him??
@chucktodd No Dictators start by having press in their hip pocket like Obama Hillary Press gets tingle up their leg Tod Fake
calling reporters an “enemy of the people,” given the invective in  which they have indulged over the last year
"One can only laugh at the eruptions of prissy sanctimony over Trump’s  tweet ..."
has always been a tool of the left!
dictators'  need fake news to get started
Chuck kissing McCain's ass as he talks against the @POTUS Dictators get started by a Corrupt MSM
What the hell is he talking about? The press IS free but should be called out on BS stories. #Duh
Press is not "holy" who cannot be criticized for bad work."News" put thru leftist filter is really propaganda.
Unfortunately, our 4th Estate has become a 5th Column.
McCain needs to retire. He might as well join the Democrat Party.
yea the free press who killed you in your campaign to be Potus they sure did love you then #loser
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain Mccain is a career pilitician, DEEP & part of the #ShadowGovernment tryn to start a coup against DJT
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain u didnt seem worried when dictator Obama was wiretapping @JamesRosenFNC
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain Songbird is a traitor to the American people and dose not speek for patriots.
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain Dictators get started by disarming the population, using a compliant media, then take down the media
McCain and Graham, media shills
Please don't be so smug and sanctimonious. MSNBC shilling for Clinton 24/7 gave us Trump
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain @WSJ William McGurns article in the WSJ this morning is another good reason to cancel sub to WSJ
McCain is a RINO with a grudge against @POTUS.  He should get over it. FakeNews from media is danger
Hey Chuck ask @SenJohnMcCain about his connection to Ukrainian energy mogul Victor Pinchuk, McCain is always about McCain
MCCAIN BEING PRANKED AND GIVING OUT TOP SECRET MILITARY INFO!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqrw2vIvBv0 …
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain Horrible propaganda and inflammatory video - I think #MCCain is not a student of history #traitor
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain By saying that, Sen McCain implies Americans can succumb to a dictator like the Germans did.
that look on your face. I hate you too!!!!!!
@NBCNightlyNews @SenJohnMcCain .you are right McCain! Hitler did the same. Controlled information. watch your freedom of info
@KatyTurNBC NEEDS TO APOLOGIZE!Another ex. of ignorance or #fakenews  @NBCPolitics @whpresscorps
Meet The Press now know as
Meet The Unaccountable Intellectual Prostitutes
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain why isn't FLynn being prosecuted for lying to the FBI?????????
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain got ro hell
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain @CNNPolitics are all your bosses Democrats and they tell you what to do right
I have been searching all day. Can't find where the press is immune from criticism in the Constitution.
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain McCain is an idiot but we share ground on ONE thing - YOU SUCK & NBC = fake news ZERO CREDIBILITY
MSM doesn' affect me at all. I don't read or listen. I don't listen to Soros backed senators either.
I think the war hero is jealous AF. Trump has a brass set of NUTZ.  He is only against BS globalist NWO prop
@ProjectCensored We have not had a truly FREE press in a long time. They are sold to the highest bidder.
If you were truly a good, unbiased journalist you would ask him about this..
@POTUS
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain @MeetThePress Oath "protect and defend constitution".  "Press is enemy".  How do we reconcile that?  Impeach?
You are just un American, picking on President Trump and giving Obama a pass.
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain UNBELIEVABLE! We had a Presidential fraud w/Obama, but, U & McCain r worried about Trump: DICTATOR?!
The fraud is 45. @TandeJane @MeetThePress @chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain
never thought I would say this... but I love Senator McCain!! Someone in the GOP acknowledges Trump is danger!
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain YOURE un-American @chucktodd ! You're a hater biased liberal who should turn in your press pass.
: Could you not use the word hate? Too negative coming from a hero & classy gentleman like yourself.

Fantastic @MeetThePress
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain You all have more influence than anyone in this country, move to impeach that so called president!
Sen McCain thank you for your honorable service to our great nation however the comparison here is just crazy.
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain Chuck, you have a lot of followers, and they don't think you're the enemy of the people...
Talk is cheap. DO SOMETHING. @SenJohnMcCain
Chuck, please, can't MTP do any better than Hugh Hewitt?
Chuck Todd is such a loser why nobody watch's him he should be throwed out of country
when we have a militant press n carpetbagger politicians bent on destroying America a leader has to call em out
Donald Trump didn't need this job he's concerned for the future of America not his "Legacy"
Chuck dragging thed bottom of the barrel using Keating 5, ISIS lover McCain to attack President
America so lucky McCain never won Pres election.Small nasty little man, got UR 1off w/Keating 5
Interesting how NBC trots out ISIS Lover McCain to attack Trump who is sworn to defeat them!!
Chefs at W.H.should quit serving oats 4 breakfast.
Chucky, your kiss fest with Obama for 8 years lowered the trust of the press. It helped elect Trump.
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain hell yes! MaCain and you are the enemy of the American people
Your worship of Obama is how Dictators get started.  #MAGA Trump stopped a Dictatorship
@DrTomMartinPhD @SenJohnMcCain Thanks, Sen. McCain! The press is only business specifically protected by the US Constitution.
we have to figure out how to prevent fake news from spreading as legit.
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain POTUS is justified in his REBUKE OF MEDIA, YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY BIASED AGAINST AMERICA'S SUCCESS,NEGATV
John sinks LOW against CIC over the water's edge.  Still butt-hurt John?  Still bitter you blew it in 2008?
I can't believe that you would poison your own democracy in this manner.  Stand behind the elected President.
45 should be ashamed. The free press are our heros. The American public deserve to understand what is going on
The press are not even close to heroes, people who serve and die so you can talk crap - they are
So the Press can criticize the President, but he can't return the favor? LOL
@SMShow @SenJohnMcCain He's a wanna be tin-pot dictator but #gop has an agenda they need him in place to sign. #EnemyYouKnow
@SMShow Stand up to the Bully in the White House @SenJohnMcCain talk is cheap. Be a hero to the US people you fought for. #ACT
SPEAK TRUTH, McCAIN! STOP SOFT-PEDALING. Trump IS an aspiring DICTATOR w/ FASCIST Cabinet & Administration. 
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain hey guys, freedom of press doesn't constitute lies, bias, and fake news. The press needs c&bs too!!
Trump is the enemy of "MORE THAN HALF" of the American people
@SMShow @SenJohnMcCain Pretty sure you should say no to everything a dictator wants. Giving them Poland wont satisfy him
.@MeetThePress @SMShow Sorry but @SenJohnMcCain is nothing but talk. He should show leadership and actually do something, but he won't.
RUSSIAN Putin WINS WAR against USA using FAKE NEWS-DISINFORMATION Coup d'etat helped by Prez DJT @GOP @FoxNews.
McCain has voted & supported everything Trump has done. His BS express roll out is a conjob.
- total agree with the Senator.
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain John McCain needs to stop being a narcissistic elitist establishment politician and shut up resign!
you're both out of your mind with hysteria.
Senator Cain    join the liberals. Traitor to your country and too the Republican party.
dude has lost his mind. As a sitting Senator it is your duty to make sure this doesnt happen, just not publicly
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain when McCain was running against Obama in 2008 media slaughtered him but now he's your friend?
Sen McCain, Adolph Hitler got started by using the media to disseminated propaganda, just like Obama
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain - You & @davidgregory have completely ruined MTP. Kind of like Bush & Obama teamed up to ruin things
Pleaaaase But when BO tried to ban Fox News from WH Press core that was ok+demonstrated free press? @MeetThePress @chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain
John McCain needs to see a therapist, Chuck Todd is not an advocate for free speech, only his speech
Too bad McCain consistently has voted with his @GOP compatriots against our democracy.
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain Your both clueless.  Everyone wants free press but not the double standard!! Undeserved criticism!
@chucktodd The news media needs to fix itself by being true to the facts. @POTUS doesn't have to fix anything. He's right.
you're BOTH full of bovine excrement
neo-naziFascistSenile Drumpf's considers AM press as th enemy line w vengeance suppress
'That's how dictators get started': @SenJohnMcCain defends the free press in exclusive @MeetThePress interview 
@chucktodd no surprise to see @SenJohnMcCain talking out of both sides of his face. His own words delegitimize the Press.
Thank you, Senator !!!!!
neo-naziFascistSenile Drumpf's accomplished embracing Russia hostile tkng Crimea region

@Tina49747372 @SenJohnMcCain yeah but I'm waiting to see you stand up to him.
I am disappointed you did not ask McCain why he continues to support Trump. Be tougher...
Why does MTP run the clip to lead views to believe McCain is calling Trump a dictator?
I agree with Sen. Paul if that old goat McCain were our Pres. he would start WWIII.
The Senator's idea of a free press is getting it to report things that are favorable to his ideology.
That moment when you wish John McCain was president... #CCBCPOLS101
#veryfakenews & #veryfakeJohnMcCain
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain chuck, you don't get it. You are are not the free press. Merely a corporate hack.
Seems @SenJohnMcCain forgot that SCOTUS ruled a large part of his signature legislation suppressed free speech.
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain chuck you are traitor to Israel. For 1000 years Muslim are attacking Jews. They want kill all jews
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain 
Will continue to watch news as well as read newspapers. Will not be swayed by 45. #ProtectTruth
it's so funny! The press doesn't know what to do now that their called out! Fake news
@BillWixey @SenJohnMcCain How about defending our democracy on the Senate floor as well?
. Dictators get started when press picks a side n holds some leaders less accountable than others
. Dictators get started when press has double standards favoring some leaders and goes after others
@FoxNews how come no one is interviewing Sally Yates she is the one who lit the fuse on this flyn scandal
@ChuckTodd @johnmccain Left DNC operative (A FACT) interviewing SWAMP RINO (term limit poster boy). Worthless.
Thank you John McCain!
A walking billboard for TERM LIMITS!!!
you really are allowed to agree with some things and disagree with others.
Chuck you look horrible get some hair plugs how can you go on tv like that or shave if off
Of course, it doesn't help when vote in agreement with them more than 90% of the time. #socalledmaverick
The dictatorship is already in full swing.
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain  Treasonous McCain / Soros Partnership /  Acts of Sedition / Traitor / Warmonger
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain stupidest damn thing I've ever heard from Insane McLame. Like talking to the Weekend at Bernies guy
So do something damnit!
#resist
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain Thank you Sen McCain for having no fear, for speaking the truth. The Emperor has no clothes on.
Something is being started by the Trump Administration, and America it ISN'T GOOD! Very SAD!!!
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain why didn't you call prebus on hi bullshit?
Part of free press, 1st amendment, is freedom of speech and that includes criticism of the press.
90% of the time I disagree w/ What McCain says, but on this topic he did have some actual "straight talk".
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain McCain still the republican the msm loves until he runs for president. How many ways to be used.
@chucktodd @SenJohnMcCain  and  to all those attacked in Sweden . Lmao time for a Doctor visit for Trump
I deeply respect you both--so great to see a reporter and a politician both doing their jobs well!
