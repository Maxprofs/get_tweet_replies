I'm a U.S. Citizen, you degenerate.
I hold a US passport you idiot, I'm an American. Also, your ancestors were immigrants too, you orangutan.
please stop talking you're making Trump supporters look bad
i am all for trump i casted my vote for him in November but this flagrent intolerance is appalling
Tell that to the idiot who gave $221 mil to the palestinians last week.
221 million is a hell of a lot less than $38billion to Israel last month.
All foreign aid should be outlawed along with free $ to illegals. They want to have 10 kids, do it in their swamp.
It'll help if USA stop bombing countries back to swamp status. Lets hope Trump is true to his word.
Agreed, get our people out & supply them what they need. It's their fight, not ours.
Yep, unfortunately its in Israels interest to have the USA keep this going. Search youtube for the ex CIA chiefs opinion on this.
Need Israel for stategic air base in case of war. That's the main reason they put up with them.
there are other Muslim nations who ally w USA where bases are located no need to comprise own security with those.
Wanna talk about the billions we gave Iran?
When we were trying to get rid of extremists militants? Sure we can
Sure we were. That's why we sent all that money to them. In cash. On pallets. In the middle of the night.
Why dont you tell me why they did it even though iran wasnt the point of the tweet
It's called ransom. Something this country isn't supposed to do. By the way, Trump's been in office 3 days.Give him time ...
what could iran possibly ransom usa for and if he does somthing good ill applaud him but so far most things i havent liked
They had 4 hostages. We paid $33.6 billion in CASH & Gold. Week later after getting the $ they held our sailors at gunpoint.
I dont have enough information on that subject to know much about that inperticular
Trump is elected and you suddenly care about the fiscal responsibility of the gov't? It hasn't even been a week! #FourYearsToGo
sign of the times...
Cry me a river.

@Mocha_Power well look who's in charge in Flint Michigan
@pausetheprocess It's a vanity product to Please King Donald.
ask Obama why he sent $221 million to the Middle East and not #FlintWaterCrisis
221 million is a hell of a lot less than $38billion to Israel last month.
#StandWithIsrael
Do you mean this American is a cuck to Israel because thats the real situation.
logic is not something that @realDonaldTrump understands
white male privilege
don't forget the vetting bill.
Ironic Obama's watch now its Trumps to Fix
@JennaLeeTV Flint won't have clean water until 2020, but yes, that #FuckingWall
@BelichickThis 
Well you know ..trump has his own priorities and all. BARF! He's insane.
but it will solve the drugs problems.
how much money did your Obama give to foreign countries
And it will probably come out of our pockets. He lied to you. He wants to get jobs for the middle class and then tax you - wall.
@TheAmerican22   But Michigan voted Trump and GOP who continues to fuck them
Dear @SenateGOP @SenateDems  Do not authorize spending for a wall. The ppl of #FlintWaterCrisis deserve better.
@realDonaldTrump
@BLUE_LXA1484 yet we spend $75 billion on food stamps where 10% of those food stamps are spent on soda....
Well put!! @MMFlint @realDonaldTrump
@mebrianne Michigan needs to take care of Michigan
Hit up the automobile companies
SERIOUSLY!
@maybellinecat Are you paying attention Michigan?  No $$$ for Flint but billions for a wall that 78 million voted against @GOP
Illegals cost 100+ billion dollars in taxpayer money, didnt see obama send the 221 million he sent to pakistan to flint
@T1theinfamous We spend Billions of tax payer dollars on illegal immigrants in this country.
The wall will save that much every day in welfare fraud and crime. You're welcome. @kristinkoziol
this is why he was elected because fear is so easy to push that they don't even realize how he is taking their rights away
Can someone sky write this?
@realDonaldTrump Trump, read this.  If you cannot read, have @KellyannePolls read it to you! This is important.  Not fake news!
@celib8shoewhore ...elected Michigan officials screwed that up
I took his tweet to mean the federal water bill that's needed, not who caused the crisis. 
Asshat quit Twitter he might sleep. But it's hard work fleecing America. Build Wall? Who Profits? This Guy Again? Not On My Watch
I agree with you 100%.
@AnthonyTBoyce
.@vinaytion The problems in Michigan's water started with privatization. Now, it'll require new infrastructure to clean it up. #GovtSpending
Not to mention the victims of tornadoes in the South still waiting assistance!
no Obama couldn't find the money to fix the water problem but Trump will
let Michigan deal with Michigan
it's ridiculous! Money for wall is completely irresponsible.  We must resist!
He'll probably use Obama's 220 million gift to Palestine that he cancelled to fix Flint. Give it time, its full working day 3.
Well, ya know, the water thing is like the poor, and the nonwhites, so whatever. But MAH ILLEGALS!!!!

/sarcasm
Money will come from savings 100 billion illegals cost us plus 55 million in foreign aid to Mexico
@DemDebD thanks for helping me block some absolute idiots.  Sorry for their existence.  Karma isn't quick enough these days.
isn't that amazing? And how are we going to pay for the investigation over voting?
well its 10B so...
its only $8-$14 billion lol point taken but wall needed. so is good water in michigan
Dont forget the 80k bridges across the US that need to be replaced or seriously repaired
it's day 6 and he's already addressing the problem in chicago??? Please @obama in your tweet because he had 8 years.
@aedaw9i why would the feds need to solve the water problems in Michigan? It's the state gov that inept?
#tRump will steal money frm education, healthcare, hiring & raises for fed employees, arts, EPA, HHS, etc to build wall. #impeach
TOO MANY IMMIGRANTS
it's almost like we haven't had a President since 2014.

Have a #blessed day
AMEN
.@vinaytion WANT TO BET IT WILL INVOLVE TRUMP CONSTRUCTION INC. TRUMP MAFIA FRIENDS CEMENT ~ KOCH PACIFIC NORTHERN WOOD 
ETC ETC
.@vinaytion I'm so sorry seeing the ignorance you have to deal with. THIS is why the Trump "movement" reminds me of Nazism! #NoBanNoWall
Did you report this person?
Yes. I reported both of these Nazis.
2 idiots does not make a movement, unless u wnt to be included in the fascists that rioted on inaug day
- Let the church say, "Amen."
He isn't even sending money down south to the families that are clearly in need of FEMA!
One is a national issue and the other is a state issue.
and you can bet that trump's profits from that Wall will be in the billions too.  BUT we dont have money for healthcare !!!
Right! Shows you his Priorities...
We can use $221 Million Obama slated for PLO Congress just Blocked from going! Obama refused #FlintWaterCrisis Trump will fix
@VictorKosha @realDonaldTrump  jerk
Say that.....AGAIN!!!
Obama could've used the money that he gave to Iran and Palestine and gave it to Flint, but he didn't!
Iran was it's own money. I repeat. It was their money. We took it during sactions. 1 more time. THEIR MONEY
@vinaytio Mhmmmmm, yeah, OK!
We took money from them in foreign accounts when we sanctioned them many years ago. Sanctions lifted=bank accounts opened Check it
Yeah, OK, just like money wasn't for hostages too.
If so then we got the coolest hostage ransome deal ever. We paid for our hostages with their money. What a deal
No it was a shitty deal with our money!
it wasn't our money. It was their money. Look it up. It was literally THEIR money, not ours. bank accounts and unfullfulled orders
Or vets, or healthcare, or education... list goes on. Make no mistake. This isn't a wall, but a monument to Trump.
@SenatorLeahy  Israel is paying for your pipes
Don't forget the cost of a "Massive Investigation" into a  non-existent problem....
no one cared about Flint when Obama: 100billion Iran, 221million Palestine,770Million overseas mosques,35Billion foreign aid
If you were paying attention you would know Democratic idiots caused the water problems in flint. Not federal tax money
of course because fixing your water does make Trumps donors rich.
yep
@dnc the democratic leadership in charge of that state and obama turned a blind eye because they didn't care.
talk to yo boy obummer about that homie
right priorities are a little miss aligned
good question why didn't OBAMA help those BLACK people with their water?
Why do you think Michigan voters voted for Trump instead of Hillary. There is a new sheriff and things are a changing.
No, silly, MEXICO is going to pay for that wall. Trump said so himself.
@Tina49747372 that nobody wants
Obama gave 251 million to Palenstine on his way out, MI only needs 216.
221 million is a hell of a lot less than $38billion to Israel last month.
Both would have been served with our borders, IMHO.
@LiberalNavySeal yes because we're trying to get rid of brown people not keep them alive -GOP
The money was there, the equipment was there. And I'm not sure how a municipal gov't's boondoggle equates to the wall...
Mexico is paying for it 
Wonder how much of that go into trumps companies?
A wall that won't even serve it's intended purpose, no less. Most undocs get here by air/water/overstaying visas. It's a ludicrous idea.
Ding ding ding! The Mexicans will pay for the wall! Catch up.
so true. I'm with u Vinay. We need to use our own money to help problems like the flint water problem not building stupid walls
