He never said she was killed by both sides. He was condemneling violence by all side. Don't tell me ANTIFA was all rainbows and puppies.
Actually Shawn; if the ANTIFA was not there..there would of been more ppl hurt. They protected clergy and several others.
And just who did they protect? Got a name? I want a name. But ANTIFA isn't as saintly as people want it to be.
Cornel West, Rev. Traci Blackmon. Hear them tell the story.
Thank you for names and a link. Those people that helped are good people. Like what is happening on the right, the violent on the left...
Now, tell me who on the right defended people from harm. I want a name.
I don't have one because I know the ones there were shitheads. I will not deny they were shitheads. But both sides have shitheads.
the difference is that the foundational ideology of the nazis is racial superiority and violence/genocide, as opposed to equality.
No! she was not, both sides are guilty of bringing about the cause that lead to her death.
True. But according to most Dems and the Media, ANTIFA are just sweet angels of light that the right and rational people are demonizing.
Did you watch the video? The car was not attacked, it was driven into a group of unsuspecting people by a Nazi.
Liar. It shows when the car got away for a little bit. Then the Communists with 
the baseball bats immediately caught up with it.
You're defending a guy who drove his car into a crowd & killed someone. You're Nazi scum & should be put down.
Bot.
Yup
There must be something the Senate can do now that we know Nazis have control of the White House
White supremacists are now organizing to show up and "picket" at her funeral. Will Trump tell us some "really good people" were among them?

I watched the service. At the end, a woman had to be escorted out by the police.
RIP. So now you need a permit to stand against violent protestors. This is no joke. Senate needs to demand resignation or full mental eval
Please don't call him Mr. or President, thanks. Otherwise, well said!
No Heather Heyer was murdered by a Democrat GOV & Mayor U should be calling out your party 4 promoting violence You & your party disgust me
Pretty sure the driver of the vehicle was also filmed at the rally screaming "Jews will not replace us" nice try though.
unfortunately #twittertrump can careless for Heather... this is why he can't come around to admitting she was murdered by 1 side only #Sad
Senator "Leaky" has no standing to make any criticism !
IT TAKES TWO TO TANGO.. yo momma should have taught u that. One being there + drew the other out= BOTH responsible. #stayhome
You find very convenient times to let your voice be heard senator.  Control your minions, they don't know they lost!
You are correct Senator Leahy she was not murdered by both sides she was viciously attacked by a terrorist who hates minorities in his mind
Violence on BOTH sides is WRONG! STOP the HYPOCRISY!! All we've seen from the left..VIOLENCE since January! #sickofhypocrites
AMEN!
There wasn't two steering wheels in that car.  There was one. It was being driven by a Nazi who wasn't good enough to make it in a real Army
She was murdered from he biggest loser ever in US history, POTUS Trumpski!
And Steve Scalise wasnt shot in the head by both sides either.
There was only one bad side......
Yeah, the angry leftists who went there to start a fight and triggered a death. Good job Soro's mob.

No, but many people have been you senile fool.  I love watching you drool all over yourself during the Senate hearings and slur your words
Don't call him Mr President. DT is an incensitive egotistical mentally ill liar. Those who really care abt Heather will always remember her!
Please don't conflate mental illness with evil.  DJT is evil, not mentally ill. Confusing the two harms mentally ill people.
There are many forms of mental illness, I'm not by any means changing the format of. DT has a severe form of a convoluted case.
As a professional in the field, no. MI comes in precisely three forms. Mood disorder, personality disorder, and psychotic disorder.
Trump has no diagnosis for any form or specific. The expert who wrote the one most commonly armchair diagnosed stated he doesn't have it.
Moreover, as I've said, claiming Trump and other evil people are mentally ill does harm to genuinely mentally ill people.  

Stop.
Heather Heyer was murdered by the White Supremacists and the KKK. White Supremacists + KKK = Boko Haram + ISIS !!!
Congress should pass a law naming alt-right as a terrorist group. We can call it Heather's Law.
Heather wasn't part of his base.  He really doesn't care
She was murdered by ONE person in the car, and that man should be executed.
All of this mess is crazy people need to turn to Jesus Christ before it's too late
No but she was murdered by everyone there regardless what side you were on if you weren't there nothing would have happened
My word Martin Luther King was against gay marriage shouldn't they take his Monument down to just saying
and the republican that got shot by one of your followers was shot by a democrat .
there is hate on both sides .
Well senator... not both sides were beaten and spit on during Trump's rally but you don't seem to mind, do you?
@grannynannynews 
NO SHE WAS MURDERED BY NAZIS!
@grannynannynews 
THEY NEED TO BE BANNED FROM RALLYS
AT ALL EVER!
CALL FOR HIS RESIGNATION
Didn't hear him say that. Play back the video and show me
Thank you Senator. Now impeach him!








I haven't heard of any reports of injuries 2 any neoNazis or wht Supremacist. 
Susan Bro, Heyer's mother, "They tried to kill my child to shut her up. Well guess what? They just magnified her." Grace, strength, bravery.
There was death, a stroke victim & injuries 2 only 1 side, Senator Leahy. These were innocent victims w/no weapons. 
If you hadn't rigged the primary against Sanders she may still be alive. Think on that senator. Demexit 15 million strong. Cheats will pay
Thank you sir for pointing that out. Maybe you can get through since no one else seems to be able to.
Robert Byrd was a KKK recruiter and racist, will you call for removing his name from all Federal Bldgs in WV? How about Russell B Long?
Question: Can @realDonaldTrump be held complicit in the death of @HeatherHyer - Just askin'  #ImpeachTrumpNow
the fact he said that is loathsome
https://twitter.com/Axel39557413/status/897846692174864384 …
Name them.. Ex: "Mr President, Heather Heyer was murdered by white supremacists you and your WH team support and value." Go on. I dare you.
According to Trump, we should not demonstrate AGAINST this group?  #Charlotteville  #ImpeachTrump
With all due respect, Sir, now is the time for you and your colleagues to denounce the POTUS for defending the Nazis!
This makes the intentions of those he is protecting CLEAR
And he never said she was. She was killed by a murderer/domestic terrorist who was a neo-Nazi. Both sides contributed to street violence.
Thank you Senator Leahy.
Senator - stand up today - go on CNN - demand Trump resign ! Be a hero ! Please !!
Thank you, Senator Leahy. Why are only Democratic senators speaking this way? @SenateGOP where the hell are you?
Please bring the whole party together with an open letter condemning his words. Nothing less tha a FULL COURT PRESS now.
She was murdered by the #AmericanTaliban -- a subsidiary of the Trump dynasty.
@alt_labor No. No she wasn't.
Do something about the hate monger in the WH. He is bringing the US down every day he is in office
Truth! Now act and DO something about it. #ImpeachTrumpAndPence #NoFascistUSA #ZeroToleranceForNazis
#UNFIT #IMPEACHTRUMP #IMPEACHTRUMP #IMPEACHTRUMP #IMPEACHTRUMP #IMPEACHTRUMP #IMPEACHTRUMP #IMPEACHTRUMP #IMPEACHTRUMPNOW
Ugh!  Please don't call him Mr. President.
Why do these Senators tweet these statements but don't send to Trump? Let me help you.. @realDonaldTrump
It takes a big pair to stand up to Trump! Thank You..

Now if others could find a pair.....wake up people.
and counter protests had a permit http://www.nbc29.com/story/36099395/city-of-charlottesville-grants-two-permits-for-counterprotests-of-unite-the-right … in fact they had two permits
Amen brother!
@mit1953 no she wasn't she was killed by racist who rather live in the past in stead of the future eejit dam them and trump
He hasn't earned the right or the respect to be called President.
@IvankaTrump @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @FLOTUS #NotOK #Racism #Charlottesville
#ImpeachTrump
Good point but you know your leader in the WH is so delusional he is not listening #theresistence
Americans were fighting Americans.   It's a lose lose for the president in this one.  It was one individual that murdered.
LOUDER,PLEASE,SENATOR!
@56030207415a433 So what will toy GOP colleagues do to this to disgraceful man who said those words? My guess: nothing.
No, the Trump is complicit in her death by encouraging the alt right groups to rise, to become emboldened, & eventually to side w/them
so you are saying that he should suppress an americans freedom bc they don't think like you?
Fox won't even admit #HeatherHeyer killed by terrorist. They say violent riots. #FakeNewskills
Facts don't matter to 45
Your absence in cosponsoring #DCstatehood #S1278 2017 to fight ongoing JimCrow tyranny over DC pop proves its ignored by Sens on both sides!
@kwn1170 

Actions, not words
#ImpeachTrump 
#ImpeachTrump 
#ImpeachTrump
This says it all about @FoxNews @fox
#LDTPoll: Is the Left-Wing Media exploiting the Charlottesville tragedy in an effort to discredit @POTUS and derail his ambitious agenda?
Has anyone addressed that even IF the white supremacists had a permit it was for PEACEFUL assembly? So T's weak/lame argument is even lamer
That's a bit complex. Maybe you should use smaller words.
I might run for President in 2020.
I have no political experience.
I hate Trump.
I hate Nazis & KKK.
I won't put us at risk of a nuclear war
#25thAmendmentNow
With all due respect Senator, our President has no cognitive  or compassionate empathy.  It's mournful for all of us.
What are we going to do about this? The GOP majority Congress are not going to do anything.They will come back from recess & pretend its OK.
By brute force they will try to pass HC, taxes & budget.They will ignore what trump said/did...NO..NOT THIS TIME.The RACISTS need to be out.
@realDonaldTrump Wrong. He is the so-called IMBECILE president. #TrumpIsPutinsCockHolster #TrumpRussia #WealthCare  #Resistance
Sen Leahy, you & GOP need to DENOUNCE TRUMP BY NAME! Otherwise you are COMPLICIT!
Um, @SenatorLeahy is the senior Dem from Vermont...he's not GOP
Ahhh, sorry!
Dems shouls denounce Trump by name too!
We should, but it often causes involuntary vomiting. I only address him as "45"...only slight dry heaving doing that.
Thank you, Senator.
#impeachTrump
Will you join with your colleagues to push for impeachment now? He is ill and unfit to serve.
He was murdered by an Obama supporter tho...
@bakedalaska wasn't blinded by both sides either. He was blinded by violent alt-left, antifa thugs. They started all of the violence.
#ImpeachDonaldTrump #TrumpRussiaInvestigation #BothSides @realDonaldTrump
Please save this country and Impeach him!
It's time, Seantor Leahy. Introduce the articles. #ImpeachTrump 

#ImpeachTrumpNow
I have a feeling #HeatherHeyer would be appalled by what trump said today
Disingenuous. If she was murdered by Antifa, would you be condemning communists? Of course not. Despicable politicking of a dead woman.
You're a senator.  Do something about it.  Get the impeachment ball rolling. You're not some guy at a diner.
The last time Americans where in this much danger by an insider was when General LEE decided to kill 600 thousand Americans.
situation is very serious
i do not see resolution until donald acts like a president should
several other nazi marches scheduled
not good
#ImpeachTrumpNow
Senator, please put impeachment on the table. Our nation and its institutions are better than this.
America is getting sick of Senators who criticize our elected President. It makes us believe you do not represent us. 
The fact that the Mayor told the police to stand down and drove the hate groups together makes them complicit in murder
Nazi's. You defend Nazi's.
He's a mr idiot. He doesn't even know the difference between General Lee and George Washington!
#ImpeachTrump #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachTrump
Perhaps if Both Sides were not so quick to jump each other, there would've been no hostilities. One side wasn't even supposed to be there.
People are free to protest even without a permit. Why are you defending fucking Nazi's?
I don't know why you give him honor by calling him Mr president!!! HE. IS. NOT. A. PRESIDENT.!!!!!

@realDonaldTrump listen to Senator Leahy - he speaks the truth. You should try it once in a while
@realDonaldTrump considers  #HeatherHeyers death justified because she Disagreed with him, & HisPlan 2BeAmericasHitler. FU #TrumpGANG FU
Why did Seattle #AltLeft burn American flags & a Muslim try to decapitate a cop?
Why are you defending fucking Nazi's? Ever cracked a history book?
Illiterate - read the Slave Narratives. Y'all are the uneducated communists/Nazi/Japanese Imperialists:

@RobertAOeser #BasketOfDeplorables
From @benshapiro National Review columnist
people were guilty on both sides hopefully they try him on murder but plenty of hate on both sides
There is no but! Stop apologizing for racist #AltRight Nazi's!
listen never will support that thug group just like the black life matteers just saying both groups came armed  but why have noone mention

Do something. Do something. Do something!!
Do something. Don't tweet about it. America is dying in front of all of us. Be the person in history that stopped Nazis.
It should be easy to acknowledge that there was violence between two groups.  I don't understand the reluctance.
And White Nationalists didn't burn down homes and vehicles during the G20 Summit. What a ridiculous point. Neither side is blameless.
No, she was murdered and 19 others injured by a pissed off kid...at this time, we have no information on whether anyone else was involved.
Both sides were complicit in the death of Heather Heyer.  When two people fight, both go to jail for fighting in public.  @potus is right.
Nope. Nazi sympathizer.
Nope, just able to see the truth.  The alt-Left have become fascists by using violence against anyone they disagree with. Open your eyes.
He didn't say she was. She was murdered by an idiot. Both Sides came prepared for violence and the #Media loves it! The ACLU sued for it.
Mr president shows respect.  45 deserves none.
#ImpeachTrump
No but others were hurt too by the other side. Me personally I would stay away from protests. Too many crazy lunatics on #BothSides !
He never said she was. He called out her killer. Maybe you should listen
Yes she was
No other violence all day ?
No she wasn't .. however is it weren't for both sides .. she would still be alive ..
Thank you.
Her blood is on you and the other Democrats hands for creating chaos and trying to dividing and conquer this great country. Shame On You!
Nope. #NaziSympathizer
Sour Grapes
What about people who were violently assaulted and had property destroyed by Antifa? Is that okay? Please step down,  yer not fit 4 office
They are domestic terrorists who are gonna start a race war. The racist in chief is backing them & has the US military at his disposal.
Does he ? I think soldiers and their comand may balk at executing people for not being nazi
The military denounced today so that's a good sign. 
He thinks its her own fault for being there I guess...
That's the best clarification any politician has made to date. Hey Potus did you get that.
And suddenly she was a remarkable woman?  Give me a break-she was exactly the kind of woman he abhors-one who worked tirelessly against him
she was murdered by a Nazi loving idiot
So you support Communists, roger
You support Nazi's?
agreed, Senator. now let's #ImpeachTrump.
But violent was displayed by both sides.
People defending themselves from Nazi's that want 2 kill them may get violent & rightly so.Look at some pics from WWII to see what Nazi's do
#ImpeachTrump
No this poor lady was murdered by a nut. Someone with mental issues. Both sides out of hand.
Lol nah, just a Nazi. Nazism isn't a mental illness and the overwhelming majority of mentally ill people are not violent.
A Trumpie Nazi
Neither were the cops that were assassinated.
Patrick seems to me it's scary a man like you is in Senate
Sen. Leahy, In case you've forgotten the evils of slavery and segregation weren't ended by "both sides" either!!
Denounce Black Lives Matter #BlackLivesMatter and #Antifa if u are so indignant concerning murderers. BUT U WON'T Hypocrite. #BothSides
Traitor,Patrick J. Leahy, Vermont Democrat, is seeking covert intelligence information for CNN.In1987, Leahy resigned from Senate leaking
Thank you, sir, for standing up for what's right.
Exactly, Senator.  FBI & DHS report in May 2017 credits 49 murders by White Supremacist Extremists in USA from 2000-2016.  More will die . .
@MsKadyClark-It's tragic she  was killed.She and others should not have been allowed there by local public officials.
Why? Why shouldn't any American be allowed to counter protest Nazi's whose we fought and defeated in WWII? #NaziSympathizer
Why? Because this is not Germany!Our laws are designed to protect all people,not just for those we like.
@POTUS
The whole thing was started by the GUN carrying white supremacist #truth
Putin is joyful as America implodes
That's a fact.
Congressman wasn't shot by "both sides" either but you blamed the right.
Kind of tough to call him Mr. President.
#25thAmendmentNow   Get Trump out
Thank you Sen. for stating this!!! This is not hard to comprehend.  It speaks volumes. The Sen.'s that remain silent, speaks even louder,sir
Yes sir senator #Truth #ImpeachTrump
She was murdered by one man.
Not by a side stop the divide
You obviously didn't hear him say the driver was a disgrace to himself, his family etc.
Yes a person on the one side killed her. You can not blame the other people on that side for the actions of this one person.
Please, please stand up for the Constitution! Impeach 45!
The violence that led to her murder was started by the left. Sleep well senator.
