Why should she uphold the law. Holder didn't. Holder is anothr disgusting example of the failure of the Obama admin.
failure? Just watch. Trump will have the best failure. Very, very best failure. Believe me. The best.
Just your wish. Nothing in our history compares to the total failure of the last 8 years.
you need to stop drinking rubbing alcohol. You missed 2009-2016. W wasn't the last president dude. Or at u playing #altfacts?
Those are the years of stupidity I was talking about. 8 years of Dumbass after Bush before Trump.
Remind me again, what was W's approval when he left office? And the economy he left was in shambles. Poor you.
Thanks to the housing market bubble created by sub prime lending started in Clinton admin.
@AnandWrites Love how women in positions of power are standing up to Thump and falling on their sword if necessary. Real courage
it wasnt principle it was politics. She knew she'd get the martyr/hero treatment you're all giving.
no it's called the fucking constitution. You know how y'all are always hollering bout #2


You do realize that the AG is part of the Executive branch right?
perfect, so you admit it's unconstitutional?
Actually no. It isn't. He has the authority to prevent any non-citizen.
No, that's what a grandstanding politically-appointed employee fired for insubordination looks like. #MAGA
it is also what violating an oath of office looks like, dishonorable, disloyal, un-American
Didn't violate oath. POTUS has authority to fire, but AG & JD work 4 the people, uphold our laws.
She upheld her oath to the constitution and was aware the consequences. RESPECT

Point? That's not the law/statute that this EO likely violates.
.@50StateProgress Are you an amateur lawyer just nights, or do you also do weekends? @jpate32211 @fredfell @tifmcclure @EricHolder
AG's argument was that EO not legally defensible. Stays proved that likely.
she would have resigned if she had any real courage-she's just another insubordinate hack, just like you
shut up troll. you are the last one to talk about insubordinate anything

#PropagandaTrollAlert #RussianHacking #FakePresident @Support
Oooh! Big tough hater bully pulling in 'support' because you don't like someone's tweet? How utterly silly. 
Srsly MaryLou, can you not see your own 1)idiocy and 2)hypocrisy?
And you aren't interested in a conversation but an argument so rightfully she identified you.
BS
u r kidding right?  U were the worse AG ever.
All I see is a bitter, jobless liberal throwing a temper tantrum on her way out the door.
trump supporters are the ones who are jobless!!!!!!
@PetV Eric Holder, don't I remember that name? yeah, fast and furious, almost forgot. How many guns did you sell to drug gangs?
bye troll
I know truth hurts, but sometimes we have to face it. Have a nice day, cupcake.
At the very least she hasn't been voted in contempt of Congress for lying under oath.

@TravelingUS Trumps a sniveling coward. #resist
@appalledvoter @EricHolder @TravelingUS Calling him a coward is an insult to cowards. Trumplethinskin is just a brat.

Nope, that's what Treason looks like. You and Lynch should know Treason better than anyone.
well that was fast...and furious.
Trump has made Yuge miscalculation
rolls out unconstitutional EO
plays reality show "You're Fired" w/Acting AG
this is day 10...
It's LEGAL, you HACK.  This sheds a bright light on the way you ran the @TheJusticeDept
So glad you are gone too. How's those sanctuary cities doing under your watch?
in your dreams
all I saw was someone not doing their job and throwing a tantrum because Obama probably told her to. "You're Fired"
everyone knows she didn't do her job because she didn't like president,she works for the ppl that voted for him
Yes!!  Thank you! Ms. Yates!!
No, that's not what that looks like. That looks like incompetence. And partisanship. You know, like yourself.
it was the correct thing to do when your new AG asked it at her confirmation.
Amazing. Sally Yates at her confirmation hearing answering her job-ending Q. Look who's asking. Via @charles_gaba  
I guess the irony is lost on most, she upheld her oath to the Constitution.  #respect
Maybe not:  https://ethicsalarms.com/2017/01/30/sally-yates-is-not-a-hero-sally-yates-is-an-unethical-lawyer-and-betrayal-is-not-too-strong-a-word-for-her-conduct/ â€¦
Your probably right, the correct course would have been to resign rather than provoke the @potus to fire her.
@kevincorke New poster child for Democrats! They are throwing everything they have out there. Just creating more division in US.
Not for the American People. Won't stick to laws.
No that's 
what liberals do ..now I would like to see both of you take the doors off your  homes ..get my meaning?
Thank you so much #1TopAG JobWellDone #Honesty #Integrity #Courage
@CoryBooker  ok , if  you say so.
Dear Eric, your failure to distinguish facts from opinions is disturbing ... good luck Californians!
@TomSteyer USA needs more true heroes like S Yates & rid its gov of cowardly unprincipled surrogates who dominate DTs ranks.
It's also a true example of real patriotism
LOL, you wouldn't know skill if you gun runned it.
Coming from Eric Holder that doesn't say much..!!
This is what a traitor looks like!!!!!!!
Hold your head high Sally. History will remember you for you honor and ethics in the face of despicable, immoral orders.
You forgot about the part that was held in contempt of Congress but I guess that's not such a big deal for a liberal
@CoryBooker This is what draining the swamp looks like
and here is the results
@CoryBooker Courage? Easy when supported by orgs
She should of resigned rather than go public and force the firing. I am not a Trump supporter, but she handled her desent wrong.
@AnandWrites Another #Nasty woman steps in front to deny Trump. Courage.
I'm sure she will be quite fine in her employment.
.... Or an American Patriots & Hero, twice standing up for integrity.
@SamanthaJPower that's what your treasonous and corrupt DOJ look like. So, sabotaging an elected resident is bravery? BS!
TY for speaking out. We need more people like u 2help stop this runaway train that's taking Democracy off a cliff!
@jazzymeister63 A terrible injustice done by a bigoted,bloated,bullyWho isNoMoreThan aBleep inOurLives.JusticeWillPrevail.
and getting fired look like!
I do find many Americans are out to sea when it comes to the Law.Trump are looking for yes people to do his dirty work.
I'll just drop this off here, you proselytizing hack. @EricHolder #2A #guns #pewpew #NRA #AR15 #MAGA
Crazy California just hired @EricHolder to fight Federal laws.
Another reason to extend that wall. CA is a raging nut house! @retiredfirecapt @AR15Nation @EricHolder #2A #guns #pewpew #NRA #AR15 #MAGA
Just the major cites but yes they are
Good ppl in Cali, too. Bought like a million guns in Dec? @JoshBB74 @retiredfirecapt @AR15Nation @EricHolder #2A #guns #NRA #AR15 #MAGA
.@EricHolder Skill? She "didn't know"
Judgment? She broke oath to uphold Constitution
Courage? She gave up and refused to argue case
as the Russian puppet regime is busy dismantling it, won't be a prob for long
Sweetie, let me know when you become an expert on the US Constitution.  @EricHolder was FIRST held in contempt of Congress
you've lost me. You've got a puppet gov, after the Russian coup, takes a while to sink in
How's brexit treating you, Sunshine?
@EricHolder
well, it hasn't happened yet, so, y'know
@jelani9 and no good deed goes unpunished.
just like all those wall street con artists that your darling didnt prosecute
Will grant you that that non-prosecution was a travesty.  Pales in comparison with what's going on now.
at every level of govt there is change at top. Some leave with class; others in theatrics.
@freedomusa_  Great woman?  Got fired for not doing her job.  Drain the swamp
I remember you. You're the guy who wouldn't enforce the LAW. Also, at the Morgan graduation...the most boring speaker EVER!
How did you stand the stench?
No stench, just boredom. I slept through some of it and played WordswFriends for some. It was torture though.
@JimiCroker no, that's what partisan politics looks like. No rage over Obama's refusal to admit Cubans the week before.
that policy effected illegal immigration (you know the thing the right hates) not people who legal were trying to enter US.
illegal is still illegal. After "they" are here, case by case basis, whether work visa, deportation, or other solution.
this is a lady that took a oath and broke http://it.How  many times have you broken your oath too many times to count
Yes. She put country and constitution before her job. #hero
Whst did she say when Holder enforced the very same pause for Obama?
Didn't happen. An ENTIRE (Not 1 Religion) county (Iraq) while fighting war there #factsmatter
Spouting "facts matter" doesn't make your dreams come true. Global war on terror. Six nations. Read.
this action will lead to more terror. Listen to the experts. Hint: trump isn't one of them
What experts? LaRaza? ALCU? SPLC? No thanks
People fighting in the Middle East? People who know something about ISIS?
Glad to see you and the boss back in action today!
nope
she did the right thing.
well I suppose it's a topic we don't agree on then.
@kevincorke this is what political games look like; senate confirmations & Justice Department  in sync choreographed by Podesta
@MattAsherS #flyflagupsidedowndistresscall
She was a rogue DOJ attorney who lucked her way to AG because the clown @SenSchumer is stalling on the Sessions confirmation.
No, this is what being fired for failing to uphold a law OBAMA signed looks like jackass.
She's very cool.
@douglasblackmon should have resigned.  What does thatdecision cost her?
Please find the 1.8 M voters purged w/ Koback's cross check. Class action lawsuit re: 19th amndnt. 2016 stolen, 2018 will be 2
looks more like a lesbian millennial to me
I have to recognize your talent for being extremely ignorant. So glad you're gone.
#OFA the big picture


#SallyYatesAmericanHero
@JacksonLeeTX18 ooops, you mean lack of strenght looks like this at times. Yes,  yes it does.
- Well, we'll soon see how a former failed & fake AG fares after a "session" w/ the new AG, won't we.
Give me a huge break. You politicized the DOJ FAR more than any other AG in the last 30 years. Go jump in a lake.
You are both partisan hacks. Holder how can you even show your face after that agent was killed with your guns?
your more delusional now than you were when you were AG
@AnandWrites I take her actions as weak. Same weakness as Obama letting Hillary go rogue/disrespectful w server & C Foundation
yeah because we know it isn't you...  Think fast and furious 
@SamanthaJPower
none of which you displayed during your tenure, making you unfit to comment on this case.
coming from you, that's rich at best!  #runnerofguns throughmexico!!
That's right!
Sally had morals unlike the idiots that kiss trump ass. The AG upholds the laws not what the president writes into law.
she appears to be as dirty as you are.
if you talk about a sacrificial lamb U might be right. Will she be the martyr you needed for your loosing cause?
. @EricHolder Said the person who ignored the law & constitution until he had to be Censured. #FakeLawyer
Hope you got a pardon from Obama before he left, otherwise...
Breaking the law !! That's a DAMOCRAT for ya! You deserve a pink hat !!!!
No, @EricHolder. This is what the Holder DOJ contempt for the rule of law looks like. So glad @potus taking Lysol to this fetid mess.
No, this is what #treason looks like.
...Wrong!!!!
No, Mr. Holder, this is what political grandstanding looks like.
#UnitedWeStand #OneNationUnderGod #WithLibertyandJusticeForAll 
#impeach the #fascist #coup and thank you for your service to our country
thank you @SallyQYates!
Well that reply was fast and furious.
A lot more Dems need to leave....imagine that, The Swamp Draining process....heck we want all Dems to leave!!!!
@stellavet And unemployment...
one POS defending anotherPOS
Just like you???
@_Joy_R and you think based on @realDonaldTrump "the look" vetting he would have loved her! @maddow @TheLastWord @CNNPolitics
thats why your city is in a mess?!
This is what a bloated, orange, blonde anus looks like:
That's what treason looks like.
@JacksonLeeTX18 Whatever 2 both of U if this would have been treatment towards Obama y'all would've been screaming racism!
Obama was treated like a "protected class" for 8 years. If you complained, then you were racist.
@CoryBooker in her heart she new she was right to do what she did. Praise God that there is still some good people out there.
@Dee_Proctor No mirrors for sure!
@ezlusztig Amen !
how would you know?
No, this is what someone and YOU are ignorant, that the president has power to. ANY president.
Or obstruction. Not surprised by the mistake. You never could tell the difference.
this is what treason and murder looks like.
#WeThePeople look forward to you & @LorettaLynch boldly lending your voices/Legal clarity to Stand with #TheResistance #StopHim
This is what a fired acting AG looks like Eric.
Trump can pick his own AG, not Obama's. 1  who doesn't meet WJC while his wife is under investigation. Yates needs to b replaced
I really hope you and others are quietly working behind the scenes to rectify the Trump Problem.
No Eric, that is what incompetence & insubordination looks like.
RACIST
@TomSteyer really.?!! After all your service this is your tweet? Wow!
"Yates told her boss 'F*** off' and got fired." There, I fixed your tweet for you.
U Sir , were a #GreatExample for @SallyQYates to follow... Thank U both for being #GreatAmericans & #VoicesOfReasonAndRight 
nope.  she's not enforcing an order.  she doesn't get to cherry pick what she gets to follow.
how's @CovingtonLLP these days? They must be happy w your refusal to prosecute bankers.
Since she had worked for Obama she thought she was above Pres Trump and would challenge him. Bad idea you got what you deserve.
Marxist revolutionaries can't help themselves, can they?
@Melissa22461016  we call this " draining the swamp"  stay salty! 
This is what abdication of your professional responsibilities looks like. Dem shill.

'Member When Clinton Ordered Janet Reno to Fire All GOP US Attys, 93 in Total, In 1993?
I 'Member
#TRUMP #PressOn #Ginsburg #Hypocrisy 
ur right, you certainly didn't have any of those attributes.  U were a disgrace as AG.  History will prove how biased u were
@TeamDmoney86  endorsed by a guy who sent illegal firearms to Mexican drug cartels and "lost" them.  
Courage now more than ever!   And send more money to ACLU. We need them!
how would you know what courage and judgement look like? Stick to sucking Obama ass
That's what bigot looks like. #draintheswamp
Yes,how she fell on her sword, now if only ALL Dems would follow suit LITERALLY
@HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats THANK YOU FOR being a HERO Sally!! https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/826419012175351809/vid/1280x720/D_OQAXdesBwRpn76.mp4 â€¦
We would never see a photo of you with those words.
actually this is what putting politics first instead of safety of country first...
The last stand of reason and legality vs. autocracy.
you still helping Mexican Mafia acquire weapons?  How many people have those guns killed btw?
Can't wait until you become the attorney general of the country of CA, complete w/ burgeoning debt and rudderless leadership.
The intent of the executive order must be debated to the full extent.
We haven't forgotten Fast and Furious Holder.  The greatest betrayal and plot against our constitutional liberties this century.
Hope she runs for Congress at least.
Here's a better photo, more apropos.
you should have been in prison 4years ago
@MichelleBrane the america I grew up in its called obstruction and lawlessness but when u just make the rules up I c your point
She did her job standing up for America & not being a yes-man (woman) to the President.
#TheResistance #DefendTheConstitution #TheLandOfTheFreeHomeOfTheBrave
another left wing hack like you.
@BJLeiderman Fired for not HONERING her OATH and Disobeying a legal Order from the PRESIDENT Of the United States!
@22Avengers Bravo
#WeAreYates
ok, wtf are you smoking??? This is what insubordination looks like. Bye Felicia!!
Hey buddy! What it looks like is Trump a man of action, fired Judge Yates, a person if inaction. Pure and simple, case closed!
President Trump is draining the swamp,  just like he said he would.
Standing for what's right? Yates was appointed by Obama as the interm who deliberately went against President Trump
Child, please.
the weasel is back
We salute Ms Yates!
What would your sorry ass know about right , skill , Honor ,courage , honesty , integrity - contempt of congress - Jack Off !
Brian Terry.
@WaimeaWitch @SMShow @frangeladuo HONOR, COURAGE, SERVICE, these are things that a leach like DJT will never understand.
why did lawyers within the DOJ approve it?  I feel President Trump is doing what is necessary to protect the USA.
Says the only AG to be held in contempt of congress for not following law to turn over documents on fast & furious gun scandal.
She's a BOSS!
enforce law or be gone. Good riddance.
So proud of her.  She kept her word.  She didn't agree so she stood her ground.
