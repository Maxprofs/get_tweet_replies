Dems have been complaining for months & months about Dir. Comey. Now that he has been fired they PRETEND to be aggrieved. Phony hypocrites!
OR - We wanted him fired for doing wrong that hurt us, but if he was doing it again and going to hurt you, well then he is a hero.
Also Trump's reasoning for firing him- his treatment of Clinton's emails- beggars belief.
could be, but isn't that what all of you wanted 6 months ago?  Trump could cure cancer and many would protest it in the streets
and yes I still think he is an awful president, but watching the flipping of sides by both sides on every issue, is part of why he won.
Firing the guy who's investigating you because he's investigating you is unlikely to be recalled as anything but historically criminal
Dems didn't trust him to handle emails, but now trust him on this?  Got it, the other side is the same, hated no charges on email, but now?
One side being upset by mishandling emails and the other by an investigation into foreign dictatorial ties is quite an equivalency
So wait, do you believe Comey was right in his handling of the email investigation? Have you believed that all along or just now?
Pssst. I care what he thinks and says. I don't give a flying rat fuck what you think or say though... FYI
Clever retort... dumbass!!!
you're not even deplorable, this is sad
thank you for endorsing my opinion
Tucker Carlson SHREDS Adam Schiff On Russian Election Hack https://youtu.be/KAq9hgTLAZ8  via @YouTube
Tucker Carlson did not shred him lol This is a BS host making fun of ppl & not answering his own questions. Not all sources can be named.
He wouldn't even say it was true. THAT is the issue. He didn't need to reveal sources.
First off this was back in Dec.So it really has nothing to do with this now. Information & actions then were diff then so answer makes sense
No. His rhetoric and his information is exactly the same. NONSENSE
It is certainly not. 45, whose rhetoric and information are total & complete lies can now add cover up to that. He doesn't even hide it
Cover up what?
I am not buying the stupid act. On the one hand you want me to believe you "know" something. Now, you play at, why whatever do you mean.Done
There's also no effing way Trump would use the word "aggrieved".  Who got hold of his phone?
So many jealous Democrats and just sore losers
Nah, I'd use the word "educated" and the concept of higher standards.  Don't assume everyone sees the world through your simple binary prism
That said it does seem like trump used the words "nut job" as part of the evidence for the clearest case of obstruction yet.
Yeah you believe in little green men, you tin foil hat junkie!!!
Rep Schiff With all due respect the dems had better take off the gloves & fight this thug in wh or we won't have  a country 2 save!!
Amen.
If I'm a phony hypocrite, doesn't that mean I'm not a hypocrite?
Basically
Damn double negatives
Words are hard
Who knew being president is too
Who coulda known!? Especially not the Don
Why are Democrats - upset at the loss of independence by the FBI - hypocrites when Trump is suddenly concerned about Clintonâ€™s treatment?
Yea, the fact  @POTUS thinks we're all as dumb as rocks is unfuckingbelieveable!
He erred on the side of trying NOT to be a tool or change election results. He did not know he was set up. Pretty evident now.
Time to impeach his ass...stop screwing around people!
We don't have to like Comey, but the minute he went on record about investigation into collusion, TRUMP firing him was no longer an option.
So Comey was guaranteed a job until such time when he decided the investigation is over, or he had paid for his kids college. Is that right?
Thank you Rep Adam Schiff.
Hypocrisy!!!!
Erred ? Comey issued a public double standard after presenting damning evidence of @HillaryClinton illegal activity and recklessness. #fact
Mmmm. If it was illegal she would have been tried, she wasn't - what does that tell you?
Tells me that the powerful and policy connected get away with it while service men with much lower offenses get tossed in jail.
Sure. I agree Trump should be in jail....
For what exactly? Any proof? @HillaryClinton had illegal server, destroyed evidence and lied and she is out walking.
Well said.  @realDonaldTrump is a #Liar #Cheater #NotaLeader #LOCKHIMUP
Yeah but his "not so bright" followers do, and that's the only people he cares about!!
Not fair. He cares about the Russian "friends" he filled the Oval Office with today. They really like him, after all.
Also alternative facts are definitely lies!!  You are hilariously awesome!!!
Ty, humor helps to neutralize all the stomach acid.
Right?!  It helps to laugh about our idiocy democracy that is approaching faster than expected for sure!!
Even when it has to be gallows humor, it definitely helps :-)
@RepAdamSchiff are you going to ask Comey, under oath, tomorrow if @realDonaldTrump is under investigation for colluding with Russia?
The hypocracy is Trump need to be locked up. Watch  the Dutch documentary on Trump and Russian mob ties. Trump causes his own drama.
Nor did Obama fire him in the midst of her lengthy investigation. Even after the Oct surprise,press sec went out of his way to not criticize
100% CORRECT MR. PRES!!!!!
He was set up. Chaffetz was swift with his scalpel. Keep your eye on the widening circle of corruption.
Signed,  All Americans
#SeekTruth
Hahaha... aggrieved. Does *he* even know what that means...? It's not yuge, bigly, sad or amazing so I doubt it.
Where's your indignation of Clinton. She lied and destroyed evidence. You only have suspicions with Trump. Stop telling lies and do it job
If Dems had proof about Trump they'd be running like a chicken without a head screaming I GOT IT. I GOT IT. After 9 months there is nothing
How could anyone be a phony hypocrite, Little Donnie?
Speak for yourself.  Unlike u Dems, we elect not to block & question @POTUS every move.  Where have u been for 8 long years Rep Schiff?
Asst attorney general threatened to resign??? This thing is falling apart and something needs to be done!!
Thank you. I voted for republicans until Trump but I'm an American first. #CountryOverParty

We know why he fired him!! Not long ago wanted to make out with him for rigging the Election!! 
Is there a contact I can send info I have that may help Russia Investigation?
Who cares??? Move on! 
Not only not believing @realDonaldTrump    but his statement is ludicrous funniest thing he's ever said
nuance - it isnt just what you get when your dad marries for the third time.

please someone get this joke.
.@BobSchecter thank you for the pity like. i can exhale now.
What difference at this point does it make?

In that order.
We know why he fired him!! Comey speaking before the public after Memorial Day
Is a "phony" hypocrite virtuous?
Schiff/Yates or Yates/Schiff for President & VP. Any order will do!
You're right. That's not why he fired him. But it's too late to take the moral and ethical high ground dummy.
honestly the @realDonaldTrump @POTUS is pathetic. Oh for the days where we had a president to be proud of,@POTUS44 
Thank you @RepAdamSchiff that goes for rank-and-file democrats too.
Please don't call him Mr. President. How about Mrs. Putin? #TrumpRussiaCollusion
The cover up 4 Queen of Corruption was no error sir!  It was an intentional cover up ---she should be in jail right now. @realDonaldTrump
NO, Clinton erred to begin with in mishandling classified and lying.  Your procedural pol. hacking is a whole different ballgame.
Sir respectfully have you listened to anyone Clapper Feinstein Comey anyone there is ZERO evidence please get out of rabbit hole & do ur job
Also I did not C U speaking out about Obama meddling in French election so please stop the rhetoric & do Ur job or U won't have 1 in 2018
You're all wrong.
Care to elaborate? Or not.
IMHO he handled both cases with class in the face of huge pressure. Having questioned his motives before Dems made it harder to critique now
Class is not a word I would every apply to our current President. Liar, selfish, rude, now those apply!
He meant Comey
He has excuses for everything
It's obvious @RepAdamSchiff needs to recuse himself from the Russian investigation He is definitely biased
Fact is shameless corrupt pig traitor trump got panic attack as Comey wanted MORE resources for Russian investigation. MAIN Reason 4 Firing
45 can't grasp the concept of acknowledging a person's faults but believing they act according to a rigorous code of ethics. An alien idea.
Exactly. Because he doesn't have a code of ethics, nor does he know anyone well who does.
Rep Shiff- you can't argue with crazy. You will never win.
He knows that. He's speaking to us. We need to hear him, so we don't give up.
I know. I also need to hear it as well. I just don't know how much longer I can go with this constant anxiety.
Forming a club. Includes discount coupons for tums & aspirin. Please join ;-)
I may need something stronger. Like industrial sized Xanax
Me, too.
@realDonaldTrump What about us non-Dems who think Comey's firing is part of a coverup? What are we?
You are our #CountryOverParty allies. If your Congresscritters are Rs please lean on them!
I don't have a party. And I live in NorCal. Just growing tired of the bipartisan tone. Trump is like Hitler, oppose accordingly.
Okay. We are glad to have you nonetheless.
You are a patriot
Just IMAGINE the uproar if Obama had fired him. I'm absolutely certain Trump supporters would have something to say about it then!
So will you step up for your country @RepAdamSchiff & investigate @HillaryClinton Uranium/RussiaDeal Benghazi/ excessive abuses of power?
Afraid? Nah, me thinks he has no idea how to NOT lie.
Because Comey was investigating Trump's ties to Russia.
No, it hasn't been "well established". Neither Comey, Yates, Rogers or Clapper made any sort of claim that there was "no ties". They ALL...
No.  Trump is not only a crook, he's a traitor.  I have problems with that.
Mr. shit I mean Schiff apparently you don't know anything about the Constitution and the presidents authority. That's OK GOP grows stronger
Oh, that play on Schiff's name was very clever...

...for a sixth-grader.
Isn't a "phony hypocrite" someone who isn't a REAL hypocrite? As in someone who isn't a hypocrite. I'm sure that's what Loser donnie meant.
Makes him look guilty
Very true Adam. Unfortunately @POTUS @realDonaldTrump lives in an alternative universe.
No @realDonaldTrump majority of citizens of these #UnitedStates know why U fired Comey #RussianGate! U'R the hypocrite not @TheDemocrats!
Mr Schiff you & your colleagues have had a hard on for Trump since he beat your candidate. How can we believe that your concerns are legit?
YOU ROCK!
Trump is a name calling bully.
I agree
You are clearly 100% against the POTUS, how can anyone take what you say seriously?
And nobody believes triggered liberals like you Adam
I love you @repadamschiff
Trump LIES.
Rep Schiff,  there are at least 500 more in the DC swamp that have tp be fired too !
Yes and one more thing... tic...toc
What we want. What we have always said is justice for all. Firing Comey was Self preservation not Justice. Grow up and see the difference
Meanwhile Spicer confirms the obvious
I don't believe you, considering your alternate explanation has zero evidence to support it despite having an 8 month investigation

Schiff has shit for brains
" Trumps house of cards will come down soon!! So many ties & so many lies!! Someone will say something! Timelines won't match! We will win!!
Exactly
Perfect
Exactly
Mr. President? Please ...
You're being too civil, Mr. Schiff.  Please help us get a Special Prosecutor.  I'm hearing McMaster is next to be fired.
He fired him yo try and get the Heat off him
In Sanders briefing today i cannot believe how many times she used the word integrity. She obviously meant Comey had no integrity. Horrible!
@RepAdamSchiff I truly hope you are going to run in 2020.
The truth always reveals itself. It's just a matter of time. Maybe this will speed up the clock. We the people are paying attention.
Time for Dems to name and shame @HouseGOP and @SenateGOP who are condoning and facilitating this destruction of our democracy.
It's really insulting that he thinks these tweets and schemes are going to fool anyone with a frontal cortex.12 yr olds have better excuses
He was fired so we could move forward and hold the Democraps to the same standard and laws as everyone else. #WEareCOMINGforYOUfelons
People who hate trump will never give him the benefit if the doubt. U r sore losers. Not about the country it's about revenge
It's not who he is. Not what he has done. Its what was done to him at this time. This is not complicated
I care and I care a bunch!
What a hypocrite! No one cares what you have to say.
You would not believe anything that came out of his mouth but swallowed everything #lyingHillary claimed about her email scandals!
Trump & the republicans had no problem before with how Comey handled Hillary's investigation except they felt Comey didn't go far enough.
Right. Why did Trump blow him a kiss in January when the horrid, heinous Comey action was in October? Cuz he DIDN'T FIRE HIM FOR THAT.
Pres. fires those who investigate him, the press is being arrested for asking ?'s & only Russia media is allowed in meetings. Do something!

Exactly!
Phony president if it had been over Hillary you would have done it a long time ago. After all it's been 9 months since that started.
Didn't u accept that bs statement fr obama & hillary that a video was responsible 4 4 Americans killed in benghazi. HELLO! @realDonaldTrump
#MarchForTruth
How dare you Adam Shiff speaknto our President the way you are term limits
Trump & the republicans never complained that Comey was too hard or unfair to Hillary. If anything they felt he was too nice to her.
Caring...
@McIlreavyP @realDonaldTrump Yeah, I hate fake hypocrites too. They're almost as bad as the real hypocrites. But that's GOP.
Also, consider that Comey was fired before Russian ambassador's visit. Putin gloats.
You know he doesn't know what aggrieved means. If you're a 'phony hypocrite', doesn't that make you sincere?
Good point. It does.
@nycsouthpaw @realDonaldTrump Who can hold DJT accountable for degrading demo norms?  DOJ?  #FecklessCongress?  SMH
Correct still think comey should be behind bars for interfering with election but trump fired him for continuing the RUSSIAN investigation
@realDonaldTrump unrelated reasons
It's not #FollowTheFacts
Yes, it's difficult to understand,simply put.

Comey's one sided handling likely because Clinton was cleared and you and yours aren't.
45 is such a hypocrite himself, nothing phony about it.
Congressman -That's just crazy talk. LOL
we believe Comey erred as well 1. not his job to decide not to prosecute 2. she should be in jail right now. 3. your beliefs dont matter.
and, @RepAdamSchiff we dont believe DEMs give a sh!t about actually helping people...you guys just want to control them! #morefreestuff
that's right, unbelievable you'd do anything nice for us, u r a fool to think we'd fall for that, more likely we're getting too close ??
I wonder how many of the trolls on this thread are Russian bots posing as conservatives...
Only thing with which I disagree is your use of the words "Mr. President." 45 is not your president or mine, and I am grateful for you.
LOL!  It's about time a lawmaker tweets back to Dictator Trump!  You can tell he's guilty because he bullies people.
Believe what you want, your beliefs align with your communist agenda so they change to suit your political party not the American people.
Amen to that!
HE FIRED HIM BECAUSE COMEY WAS REAL CLOSE TO CATCHING ON TO HIM JUST LIKE SALLY YATES WHEN ARE GUYS GOING TO WAKE THE
Oh.yeah.
I would say, POTUS, look in the mirror
Was it possibly related to prosecuting #MarthaStewart    in 2003?
Yeah...that's it!
Had to be!?
Demand a Special Prosecutor Representative Schiff We are counting on you
We all know supposed president #Conald trump didn't tweet that...in no alternate universe can he even spell aggrieved
That part...
Nor did we demand that you fired him because he erred.
Trump behavior is like a teenager with a rich daddy that gives him everything. Not a so-called successful business man. #NoWinning
What I don't believe is at one time, dems wanted fired, now all the sudden they are bitching because he been fired. Make up your damn mind

#ConstitutionalCrisis #ConstitutionalCrisis #ConstitutionalCrisis #ConstitutionalCrisis #ConstitutionalCrisis #ConstitutionalCrisis
Handling of case that's been over for 6 months is not a reason to be summarily fired on TV. Must be some other reason...
He doesn't even get that he's been praising him for over a year and now said he lost confidence. He doesn't see the irony of his tweet? Sad!
In the words of Leo McGarry- "the process matters"
Well said!
I would change one thing.  We KNOW that's not why you fired him.
Oh oh oh oh oh opa trumpem style
Mr. Schiff we do believe you think you are part on the New World Order. Trying to destroy our country from within.
Hey! Look at that distraction over there!
Go Schiff Go Schiff Go Schiff
I do not think you can say it any clearer.  Unfortunately, even then, Donald can not grasp it.
Oh palllezze
And neither does the public...if they have been listening
Funny, @NancyPelosi and the rest of you did before
Calling the majority of American voters "phoney hypocrites", doesn't endear him to them!
Thank you for all you do, Mr. Schiff.  If we are going to be hypocrites, the best kind would be the phony kind. #WordPower
Rep Schoff, Speak for yourself and the other conspiracy theory DEMS.  We the people r 100% behind POTUS!
Update: Rep Schiff not Schoff.
@billoreilly @SenSchumer @POTUS @JudgeJeanine  Adam Stiff  Suck It Up Move On You Have Nothing To say That Carries Any relevance
That you are delusional does not convince me you are right.  (Something like that...)
I agree Mr. Schiff, I just don't believe @POTUS  cares what anyone thinks. Now more than ever we need answers before it's buried to deep
Go get em! You've got my vote.
Thank you @RepAdamSchiff
Thank you!

PLEASE no matter when he did it he would have been criticized!
It had to be done
Move ON
You still have Russia
agreed. but what comes next is even more premeditatedly cynical (by me) and completely good (by trump): a major attack. hopefully his heart.
Judging by his sheltered behavior the past few days I wonder if he had a stroke.
@POTUS your an irrational person.
TRUMP IS THE PHONY HIPPOCRIT- WE HATE HIM
Thank you Rep. Schiff. America deserves the truth re: Trump-Kremlin!
@HowardBeck @realDonaldTrump best way to say it
Based on Trump's gushing & fawning over Comey a  scant few  weeks ago, his hypocrisy argument falls apart.
The real problem is trust in our govt there is none

well said!
Thank you @RepAdamSchiff for keeping the investigation honest!
He needs his head examined! Projection, avoiding and lying is all he knows. THIS IS ALL ABOUT YOU tDump
@RepAdamSchiff speaks the TRUTH!!! Thank you for being a voice for the American People!
I care, because I need to be aware of what's coming down the pike, this fool is reckless and a big liar. I don't want any surprises
