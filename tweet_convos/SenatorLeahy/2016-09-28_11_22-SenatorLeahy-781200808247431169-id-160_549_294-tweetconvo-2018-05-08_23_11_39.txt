Syria's ambassador to the UN, Bashar Al Jaafari, laughs when asked about hospital bombings in Aleppo by @baysontheroad. 
.@AmbassadorPower @AJEnglish Babies being born in Iraq with horrific birth defects due to US use of depleted uranium shells.
#Chilling
Kennedy knew this without any Stupid Think Tanks advising him, but you are fronting for Stupid Neocons. Why do you do that?
How then can US elected representative even make proper decisions re the US if they are tied to Israel at the hip
US president chair is designed by zionist lobby, they have the media they ve the banks & the biggest corps @AmbassadorPower
In politics, what you see is seldom what is true. Zionism is a convenient distraction for WASP actions

@AmbassadorPower
has you forgotten that your country killed 100000s of Iraqis over the last 20 years or so!!
How about @JohnKerry May GOD ALLOW CONSEQUENCES TO USA TERRORISM REGIME LOVERS LIKE NEVER BEFORE! @Pontifex
In The Name of GOD JESUS CHRIST AND ALL PROPHETS ALLOW CONSEQUENCES TO ALL MASS KILLERS
.@AmbassadorPower @AJEnglish Your hypocrisy & 'holier than thou' approach is repulsive. US is as guilty as anyone for the chaos in the ME.
Picking a fight with Russia to start WWIII is a disastrous US policy which will quite literally blow up in your faces
tell us what you would have done in South Ossetia, Ukraine, and Syria. I'm interested.
Minded my own business, stayed within my borders, developed sustainable power sources, stopped acting the bully

@AmbassadorPower
@ReporterSyrien @AJEnglish @baysontheroad no offence but there must be a thousand hospitals in alepo
@AJEnglish civilians in #Yemen dying on a daily basis due to US backed, illegal Saudi led war. #Chilling.
.@AmbassadorPower @AJEnglish @baysontheroad well well well, isn't that the same reaction by the Saudis re Iraq , Syria and Yemen ?!
laughing on AJE question is great reaction,this channel frm terror state is criminal
I disagree,q could be"who you think bombed the hospitals?" Etc
you are an out and out liar of the 1st degree!

shame on you
.@AmbassadorPower Was willst Du eigentlich, Du krankes Nazi-Schwein?
@baysontheroad The us should stop supporting terrorist .Syria is not Libya/Iraq/Afghanistan. We need peace no us war
.@AmbassadorPower @AJEnglish Years of failed US foreign policy resulting in over 1million dead Iraqis after illegal 2003 invasion.
#Chilling
Getting rid of Assad, like continuing to sanction Iran for so long, will  not benefit the United States one scintilla

@skoblar66 @AJEnglish  And the US State Sept under Clinton made it possible. Obama's red lines have disappearing ink.
THEN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!
: When our Russian allies blocked/destroyed humanitarian convoys, we ran the Berlin airlift. Where is our #Aleppo airlift?
@AJEnglish @baysontheroad You are a hypocrite..remember the kid you ran over in Africa and paid $1700 as compensation
The US has the potential to be a world leader but not when its elected representative take a pledge to Israel FIRST
you are just a shame, you (USA) doing worst crimes against humanity in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen with your salafist friends
Why Everything You Hear About Aleppo Is Wrong https://youtu.be/I8mA0h7dCKI  #aleppo #nato #regimechange
Being pledged to Israel, every US representative is a flawed creature and nothing they say can be taken in good faith.
If you do nothing else in your life Ms Power please get your country's house in order before accusing others of killing
Finger pointing at alleged killings by other countries but expecting others to ignore murders by your police force? What?
US police have had an epidemic of killing black US citizens and AGAIN, you get a free pass on these murders. Why is that?
The US is blithely executing people without trial using drones throughout the world & you get a free pass on these murders
Nowhere in your screenplay have you advance a reason why Assad would target his own people, as opposed to rebels
Really, because this interpretation plays to your agenda? He could just have been laughing at the inanity of the question.
@AJEnglish @baysontheroad stop trying to coverup your own War Crimes http://www.globalresearch.ca/syrias-hospitals-targeted-by-nato-backed-armed-groups/5363563 … in #Syria
Your tweet says more abt you then it does about Jaafari. You know why he was laughing because the question is ridiculous.
Seriously do you want WW3 for your children because it will arrive at US shores if you escalate this with Russia.

@AJEnglish @baysontheroad three years ago NATO & US bombed hospitals in Aleppo & Afghanistan !
People laugh when you make up lies.
Congratulations on writing a great gov tweet! http://shiningsea.measuredvoice.com/ambassadorpower/status/781197282100346880 … (Ranked 16th for Sep 28.)
I don't see how executing the Anglo-American mercenary du jour could be considered a crime when it's a war crime sentence.
So when the Anglo-Americans slaughter thousand it's #Democracy but when #Syria or #Russia does its a crime against humanity
@AJEnglish @baysontheroad thousands of years tens of thousands of years of humanity and all we do is neglect
@AJEnglish @baysontheroad its aterrible thing samanth suffering.
absolutely!I&my great @margbrennan "condemned" ,agree w/@AmbassadorPower ,"deeply concerned" ,"war crime",stop bombing...
Dieser Mann ist kalt wie eine Hundeschnauze,genauso wie Assad, der Massenmörder
The US are responsible for this (arming extreme jihadists out of geopolitical reasons). You hypocrite!
This is the true face of coward Americans who has killed millions around the world.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8JppJyVxYU …
After watching this I realized that with money and corporate media you have created war and using shield as @UNHumanRights
America caused it and so just continue killing them all
The US  can only be humane by stopping arming rebels.Otherwise,just hypocrisy.
2-Could not be intentional could it be?That's cruel, criminal is putin
1-The Russian's have been targetting hospitals & medical staff since last year.
Child-killers can't be saviours or peacemakers. Assad & Putin are mass child-killers. #Syria
Once the US calls Russia's actions in Syria barbarism,it should stop negotiating with Putin
this is result of silence 2 the occupation crimea despicable & appeasement with the mullah
What about the terrorist scum that is laughing here?
Must see slip-up in Jazeera video. Check out how the guy's expression changes from a smile to feeling pain when he sees camera on him #Syria 
@AJEnglish hasbara propaganda AMC #holliwood producctions, all people know US zionist puppets only ve zionist owned media
@AJEnglish @baysontheroad And where is the Face of America's Actions and caos arounf the world looks like ?# Yemen...
@AJEnglish @baysontheroad when will US put Saudi Arabia on the sponsors of terror list?
https://theintercept.com/2016/05/06/former-u-s-diplomats-decry-the-u-s-backed-saudi-war-in-yemen/ …
@AJEnglish @baysontheroad what's chilling is US support of terror in the middle east disguised as humanitarian relief.
@DrsP38 @AJEnglish @baysontheroad  this is the face of.... a bitter woman betraying the American pride & dignity
@DefenseBaron @AJEnglish @baysontheroad Chilling is the perfect word.
@baysontheroad u know, so far the regime has been more honest and transparent than the US. He did what he promised he will
So that Red Line never worked?
@AJEnglish @baysontheroad Stop supplying the rebels who hold non Sunnis as human shields. If your appalled be constructive
@AJEnglish @baysontheroad  Surprised the people of Aleppo haven't surrendered to the government? Can you get assurances?
Is this the best Obama admin can do..Tweet weakly and whine? Aleppos blood is all over  your incompetent hands.
if only you and @POTUS were in some sort of position to do something about this.......
@AJEnglish @baysontheroad The backers of Al-Qaeda & ISIS are crying foul when their men are being bombed by SAA & Russians.
Indeed As it is Every Time They Laugh at Something Evil They've Done Coz After 5 yrs They Know We'll do nothing about it
@WillieGeist @AJEnglish @baysontheroad what's really chilling is the media bias
@WillieGeist @AJEnglish @baysontheroad or the faces of those who SUPPORT the Assad regime bc w/o him will be slaughtered
@WillieGeist @AJEnglish @baysontheroad or the faces affected by ISIS who was able gain strength by said US bombs
@WillieGeist @AJEnglish @baysontheroad y didn't we c the faces of those affected by the bombs the us sent against Syr army
This is the face of USavages regime & YOUR actions in Libya you disgusting war criminal bint:
Its from 6yrs seeing you & Goebellean parrots passing oral flatus & spewing faeces from that rectum you have on your face
govs are to blame. it's western banks who keep Russia viable. why aren't you calling for Putin be neutered? @AmbassadorPower
"Ambassador! Was the US government strike on Syrian troopers on Deir Ez Zor a mistake ?" 
Samantha Power: Laughs...
Neocon wars backed by US, financed by Saudi Arabia, with Turkey hosting and training islamist, IS fighters. Civil war? Not!
Last ceasefire was sabotaged by neocons and their lackeys in the Pentagon, State Dept, WH. No way even you can spin it!
US, hijacked by neocons, has turned rogue, and is directly responsible for the chaos and suffering throughout MENA
Rude talk and lame attempts at projection of own faults - no longer effective.
@sameerft @AJEnglish @baysontheroad this is the level of evil
@AJEnglish @baysontheroad Pure. Unadulterated. Evil.
@AJEnglish @baysontheroad moderate terrorist
@njaresko @AJEnglish @baysontheroad Chilling is how there's no meaningful military response to #Putin's war crimes. #MH17
@AJEnglish @baysontheroad 
How much r u paid 4 such lack of intelligence?Give us a clue?
I'd b laughin at u 2 if I were him
The lowest feckin insult to a Syrian man.
I'll rephrase that, the lowest feckin insult to 'this' Syrian man.
chilling is when diplomats don't do their jobs but throw hissy fits and walk out of meetings #seriously
@AJEnglish @baysontheroad God Almighty,the UN and our Ambassador to it are useless. Kerry is worse.
@sameerft do you now understand why ISIS was born?
@AJEnglish @baysontheroad
@Heisse13 @AJEnglish @baysontheroad 

Assad/Putin target civilians.
Surprised?
Where's the responsibility to protect?
@meshaluk @AJEnglish @baysontheroad It's happening on your admin's watch, Ambassador. History will not look back kindly.
Forget about Syrian maternity hospital u bombed a few months ago? What about doctors w/out borders? You have no credibility
what's chilling is working with the government who actually bombed those hospitals (Russia)
@meshaluk the question is why he still in NYC?
.@AmbassadorPower 1/2 When the people making the claim themselves release CCTV from the hospital showing clearly that wasn't bombed
.@AmbassadorPower 2/2 how else are you supposed to react?
he laughs because he knows that his Regime is protected by Obama.
that sent a chill thru me. A 
stupid questions deserve nothing but laughs
@AJEnglish @baysontheroad Still looking for the arms of mass destruction in Iraq? In LY you helped Muslim B that are Isis.
this is really pathetic. You killed millions from Vietnam to Iraq to, yes, SYRIA ... wake up!!
 @AJEnglish @baysontheroad
@WillieGeist @AJEnglish @baysontheroad delete your account, useless tool
@AJEnglish @baysontheroad not funny had him are a family member was in the bomb hospital.
And yours is the gnarled face of a monster desperately obfuscating, w/ no regard for our violation of the #SyriaCeasefire.
@AJEnglish @baysontheroad as a powerful country in the world , what have you done about it ???!!
I suppose he should just say everything is and accident. What's Good for the goose is good for the gander, yes?
@AJEnglish @baysontheroad @JohnKerry 
You are a pathological liar. 
US is the only obstacle to peace
Страшнее атомной войны!

@RawanDaas @AJEnglish @baysontheroad
Need to take more action against Russia now both 4 #MH17 #Syria isolate Russia ban flights in/out Russia to west
@WillieGeist @AJEnglish @baysontheroad  I do believe that hell is expanding on a daily basis.  So many to let in #Aleppo
@WillieGeist Don't you think it would not have been this bad if the US had kept it's word about the "red line"????
can we have that in its full context instead of 12s, or would that harm the narrative you're shilling?
Oh boy! Another Arab country for the US to invade. What could go wrong?
There Will Probably Be More Of It In The Future.. The Emirates, India, Bangladesh.. All Overpopulating Supply!
Not To Mention The Whole Middle Eastern And Central Asian Coming Conflicts Over Water That We See On Its Way!
Many Will Likely Be Slaughtered To Accommodate Demand Of Dwindling Supplies!
And we're talking about beauty pageants
https://williamblum.org/essays/read/overthrowing-other-peoples-governments-the-master-list … It's a good read, you do know how to read, don't you?
you expect way too much from @AmbassadorPower
Bashar Jaafari and his boss govern us 46 years ago, the top of unhappiness.
Doesn't it remind you of the US forces in Iraq? Not even a little?
@AJEnglish @baysontheroad that Assad evilness is the living proof that every single word on those monsters is a waste.
@AJEnglish @baysontheroad Shameless
