This is Joe Arpaio ugly. "... law that would have allowed police to inquire about people's immigration status during routine ... 1/
... interactions such as traffic stops." This in the midst of flood displaced persons. Despicable.  2/2
Of course. The @GOP wants to fund their massive tax cuts for the wealthy, rip away mortgage deductions for avg people, and screw the poor
That is a great question. Because the Dems are too afraid to come back with a strong response to GOP points. They can't seem to find voice.
We have to have responses to EVERY STUPID issue. Border wall? We are sovereign nation SO we must manage border. It is HOW we do it...No Wall
But we spend our time complaining amongst ourselves and arguing about Bernie v Hillary. What are we FOR?? Not just what we are against.
We can't have everything we all want, but as progressives, we need to find our compromise, make our message then bring it ON!
So what are you guys doing to get an appropriations bill through the house to refund FEMA and provide temp housing and personal needs?
@realDonaldTrump does NOT care about keeping Americans safe from natural disasters! #ImpeachTrump
He does not care about Americans at all. #ImpeachTrump
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend" @SenateDems must work with @HouseGOP and Senate to stop @realDonaldTrump from any more damage.
Wondering what you politicians are donating to Texas?  Just taxpayers money?  These people need ur help!!!

love the vulture birdie, he's contemplating the pickins'
That's a Dodo.
a dodo.ah! now i get it....merci beaucoup
Kind of obscene watching the GOP kissing the Koch Brothers ' as*es.

Why are the Ds telling their followers that only the wealthy are getting tax cuts?  What a big lie! Quit being duped, people.
Tribalism is a nasty drug and u know how drugs mess with cognition.
OUTRAGEOUS & totally against common sense. States like TX MUST change their lack of regs that would protect citizens during severe weather.
Never believe a dem they wouldn't know truth if it walked up & introduced itself. Bunch of lying controlling selfish Un-American haters.
It they cut $1 billion from disaster funding to build the f***ing wall they will kill as many people as repeal and replace would have!
Outrageous. Our country is endangered by a GOP hat seems to have run amok.
The Rs will cut FEMA by hundreds of millions, but only for blue states. They'll make sure to get funding when red states are hurt. @tedcruz
Right.  Just for blue states.Paranoid much?
Um NO!
Of course you don't. You creeps forget all your aberrant behavior once it's no longer useful. Let me help you:
JADE HELM
look it up.
Here, I'll make it even easier.

With actual video of Ted Cruz & Tx Gov Greg Abbot supporting the conspiracy theory.
Gotta admit, that's crazy.  So is thinking that Fema will cut funds for blue states only.
Rs will cut FEMA now, & pass a bill for emerg funding if a disaster hits a red state. Blue states are S.O.L. b/c Rs will deny them emerg $$
FEMA receives flood insurance premiums as major portion of funding.  My condo bldg paid 5800 to pvt insurer, under FEMA, 11000 a yr?
So are you guys going to get justice about 9/11 or are you gonna sell us all out till WW3 for your pay masters
How many of Trump's golf trips, his kids' excursions with sec. service, would cover the FEMA reductions?
Fact is the Democratic's have had nothing to do with the help that was put into action by OUR PRESIDENT. Thank You @POTUS and @VP
@SenateDems @HouseDemocrats DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO GET AWAY WITH THIS.
There you have it!
Finally!! Make the state's fund thier own disaster relief! I didn't decided to live in a disaster zone, dont make me pay for those that did
Almost every one that replied is ASSUMING !! Quit listening to democratic BS and use your brain if and when actually facts arise - LIBTARDS
Coast Guard is getting wild praise, so cut it's budget. And, since the US has no disasters to face anymore... @POTUS this OK with you?
Okay. Where do we cut? U do realize we're $20T in debt... don't you?
Disgraceful!
Seriously!??
And the @DNC begins their propaganda of lies & fear tactics.WELL @POTUS  @realDonaldTrump has already said Texas will get whatever they need
#FEMA Flood insurance s/b private, not fed backed.  Anyone living on GULF COAST w/o flood insurance is negligent.  TX should pay for TX!
Bass turds.
Great point, but based on the replies it seems that this only panders to the D base. How will this point get to Is and mod-Rs? #morevotes
TSA, Coast Guard and FEMA - good grief. All to appease one dangerous fool's drooling need for an unnecessary wall.
Republicans might be wise to rethink that. They won't. It is not the way they are made.
Wow.  Crazy!  So what are you all doing about it? Will you be ready in 2018 w/ a solid plan?
I wonder with those cuts to #FEMA if even #Brownie could do a heck of a job?
Cut corporate taxes to 15% so corporations can squirrel away more cash and increase deficit? "Trickle down tax cut wage increases" Sure!
@potus  And look at Coast Guard.  Note their crucial role in Harvey rescues and relief.  Look at TSA... safe borders? need a wall? #idiots
Because @GOP lacks empathy until IT HAPPENS TO THEM!
We had 8 years libtard
Never forget how GOP president reacted when Katrina demolished LA & MS. Or how republicans wanted to torpedo Sandy recovery.
Thank you for posting this!
Just incredible!
I'm looking at this proposal and I'm thinking the illegal immigrants will come by water now that the Coast Guard budget is being slashed.
And guess what'll happen during the next super storm when the water hits trump's beautiful massive wall.
#Kakistocracy government by the most unscrupulous or unsuitable people, or a state governed by such people. Pretty much screams @GOP
Try promoting education! Because your whack
Actually there are only certain states that need it
Also, look at the big hits my Coast Guard would take!
Shut up no one believes you anymore. You have no idea how to work with anyone.
Gotta pay for that stupid wall somehow!!
i
This Trump supporter from Houston makes me ill. PLEASE READ her Post. I didnt know Harvey was a R or D disaster? 

https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1806614649352156&id=100000109154368 …
WTF?
According to @realDonaldTrump and @SenateGOP there is no such thing as climate change, so this is how stupid decisions are made.
@POTUS @VP @SenateGOP @SpeakerRyan Criminal. Cruel. #killingyourbase When will they wake up and kick your asses out?
If you believe everything the Dems toss at you, I have some seafront property in South Dakota for sale...cheap?
give it a few year ya might... lol
He's a climate change denier.
Joel Osteen will pick up the slack!
When was this released? Before or after Harvey?
This is the lusted-after border wall money.
It cannot be allowed to happen, human beings are at risk.
They don't care about the people....and that is people's money.....they missed the point, completely
Try to take out $75M now someone's going to have to add back in the $875M + another $74B. Great planning.
More lopsided "financing" from #EvilGOP, whose goal it is to steer every cent possible to their wealthy "donors." #TheResistance #QuidProQuo
Why don't you explain that rescission=cuts/reduction in funding?One problem w/Dems is they assume ppl understand&r smarter than they are
What recession?
this response 
not sure what your trying to say
Just skimming the fat off GOV. I dont see any DEM donating thier pay for America. DEMs to afraid to see a true decision maker.
bot
Hope that wall can help those people in Texas.  #TrumpResign
Yeah, because @fema can't possibly do any good at all with that $875M. What with Texas and Louisiana currently flooding.
Rescissions means taking away
If only the debt hadn't been doubled.
shame!
Why the hell did asset forfeiture need funding? That crap funds itself and then some on top of flat out violating the 4th and 5th.
GOP are insane, but I bet any project that would line their pockets would not be cut except lower tax rate to line their pockets & the rich
Wow, when was this? And where is it?
Oh good! Coast guards are on there. Guess they can stop protecting Mar-A-Lago!!!!
GOP=GREED OVER PEOPLE
Actually, balanced budget and pay down debt.  Stop the handouts.
And tax breaks to the wealthy.
Come out with a plan if you don't think that's enough.
This is the amount GOP proposed to cut, not allocate. The opposite plan is to leave FEMA funding alone, or even increase it.
You can always have special provision for catastrophic events like #HurricaneHarvey. Congress has never had a problem spending money.
And the USCG? What about their funding? The scope of their mission is huge.
Well hea your part of it so why question it unless you want to act on it.
@Sam274378651 is a #putibot #KremlinGate #OpDomesticTerrorism
This is an image showing @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP idea of serving America.  What are they going to do with the money? Tax cuts for rich
perhaps provide for the failing Social Security system
