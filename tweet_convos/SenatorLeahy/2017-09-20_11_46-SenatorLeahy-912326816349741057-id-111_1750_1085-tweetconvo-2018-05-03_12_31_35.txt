STILL pushing Obamacare??
Good, get everyone off of entitlements.  What happened to responsibility and taking care of and respecting our elders.
IMPORTANT: People must understand that employer plans WON'T protect them. Rates for covering pre-existing conditions will be prohibitive!
At big companies everyone pays same premium. How can that be. I would need to know
1/ If coverage for pre-existing conditions, mental health, rehab are no longer mandated by ACA, they will be inclined to drop from plans
Cassidy-Graham also does away with the employer mandate, so you might not even get the employer plan.
That is incorrect. Employer plans WAY predate ocare. Think.
Pro-tip, if you want to say something is incorrect, provide credible sources to substantiate your claim.
Are you seriously saying there was no employer healthcare before Obama?  Geez
No, I'm saying that there will no longer be a mandate for employers to provide health insurance.
AARP,Why not tell the prople that Obama has robbed Medicare (older people)to fund expanded Medicaid (noncitizens having 50% of our babies)?
You are one dishonest bunch
More fake liberal propaganda. How about you state the facts and let the people decide instead of trying to brainwash them?
Vote no.
If this ain't the Devils work I don't know what is...

Aarp u helped ruin our health care & u never cared u made ur money . Not to be trusted
As usual follow the $. AARP just puts out fake data to cover how much they receive from keeping status quo
#GrahamCassidy is about defunding abortion. That's why it's in danger of getting shelved.
AARP please check out http://www.thebartlettclinic.com  IN COLUMBUS Ohio They have an innovative approach to Healthcare that benefits your members.
Ya but the replikans only care 'bout the RICH old people.
We need to stop this travesty.
Low case? Middle case? High case?
Pretending 2 b prolife,#45 @SenateGOP will kill folks thru lack of medicalcare when they are old but are anti-abortion VoteNO #grahamcassidy
And your the group that supported the Save $2400, Keep your Dr, Keep your plan rhetoric. AARP = Fake News. Are you owned by @CNN ?
In Europe they just euthanize people with dementia.  Still think socialized medicine is better?
AARP = lies and more lies - trying to protect their insurance company
OR it could be increased to pay 100% by 2036.
Typical welfare staters. Any cut is bad.
It's tapered down over years. People don't lose everything overnight. Go after Big Pharma to bring down costs! ACA is hanging by a thread.
Fear mongers...seniors have Medicare?


Is this what winning looks like?
Why not have cost controls/clarity on what can be charged for services? Big Pharma addicted millions for profit & increased total HC costs.
They're basically hedge funds in disguise.
Premiums have gone up partly because there is no accountability on what can/will be charged or how much profit can be made by providers.
Big Pharma creates drugs that need to be taken for life/long time for cash flow. They have no mandate or requirement to develop actual cure.
WHAT DOES AARP CARE ? OH RIGHT  BIG GOVT. OK AND 
Dem shill your ## are garbage. For years you shafted seniors with your self dealing insurance scams. Feds forced divestiture.
Quit shilling for failed Obamacare.... #RepealAndReplace NOW!
Fake news
AARP@got millions for pushing shitty Obummercare. AARP is LIARS! Wake up America!
Why did U get out of United health Care & why is Medicare & Medicaid meshed together?Having R own choices in health care we did a lot better
The Cassidy Graham bill will cause inadequate care for the elderly and disabled
Can't believeA word they sayObama is having his friendfrom Hartford AARP do a no# on replace OB carethis bill would KILL OBC forever
Aarp is left wing business.. period...
Not winning
#KillTheBill #NoGrahamCassidy

Greedy Gop should be able to read this chart
Is this how you #maga?
The sole unchanging  stat in all GOP death plans: millenials covered to age 26
AARP...apparently another libertard organization
"COULD hit" by 2036? I'm not a fan of #GrahamCassidy, but #AARP is assuming nothing changes before 2036.
Another non profit cashing in on the ACA. Payoffs so they will be pro mouthpieces to once again screw the taxpayer. 
Older adults go on Medicare. Medicaid as it sits today will destroy America. Little or copays, unlimited ER visits!
Drop aarp and change to AMAC, aarp backed Obama & supported Obamacare
AARP just doesn’t want to lose millions they make off Obamacare subsidies. Medicaid needs adjusted and states need to be in control not feds
And THAT's  MAIN thing the koch bros want..to RENIG on medicare for 70million baby boomers who protected them and made them rich buying TP!!
Here are the 32 million losing Healthcare!
I call BULLSHIRT. AND older adults go on Medicare! !!!!!
Medicaid is broke. If the govt was not stealing theses pols monies in the first place they may have been able to care for themselves.
.@lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @SenCapito @robportman @DeanHeller @JeffFlake Know the facts b4 vote. #fixACA
Sure AARP, one of the huge benefactors of Obamacare is AARP. Friend to Obama. Made $$$$$$$$ on Obamacare. How about shut up.
You said Obama care would lower premiums increase our coverage and we could keep our doctors! Your credibility is gone.
Assoc against Because they will need to pay lobbyists in each state as opposed to wooing the politically elite in Washington
AARP know how to hit seniors for money. Liberal organization that supports Obamacare just to sell a supplement. Shame on them
AARP has lost its way. Now another #Leftist organization just trying to pad govt #HC programs.
Medicaid is not a permanent place msurance. Temporary helping hand. AARP is for Medicare age individuals. So who are you protecting?
It's not temporary for those in assisted living or nursing homes who ran through their savings.
Hey AARP, remember back in 2016 when you got behind the GOP and Dump? I do. You failed the people who trusted you.
AARP supported Obama and Obamacare. AARP gave out false info then and now. AARP lied to seniors and now using scare tactics again
You are paid by companies to advertise. You are a Democrat service & lying to seniors is WRONG. States will receive funding to manage.
What can I do ? I live in Dem state??
Republican wet dream - sorry
AARP is in bed with them and does not serve members,

What part of $20 trillion national debt is confusing for people? The US is beyond flat broke.
GrahamCassidy seems to want to kill large numbers of older adults. We must stop this!

These left wing positions you espouse are the reason many people like me put those AARP invitations directly from the mailbox to the trash.
and the right wing is basically throwing you in the trash with their #DeathPanel proposal.  You won't need AARP!
Your people should have taken the time to campaign in states like Wisconsin if bailing out the insurance companies is so important to you.
this tweet stream is about the health and cost of healthcare for all Americans.  Not sure what you're blathering on about.
Propping up Ocare is nothing more than an excuse to bail out insurance companies and other Wall Street "friends" of Barry/Hillary.
No, NOT INSTALLING SINGLE PAYER as Bernie is recommending is an excuse to do that.  The insurance companies are friends of the GOP.
Insurance companies profit from Ocare bailouts. Just noticed you follow @keitholbermann so I need to block you on principle. Sorry.
I work with elders. Ranging from 74yo-97yo. They can barely afford healthcare right NOW, let alone if this bill passes. #KillTheBill
#KillTheBill

You won't be so smug when you or your family end up in a nursing home and your retirement runs dry.
There won't be any Medicaid to help you.
I'm not smug.I work as a HC Fin Consultant all over the US.i know how this works. At the rate of prem/Ded increases with ACA, retirement??
And did anyone else figure it out? States California and NY hurth the worst- hmmmm Hillary won both those states by ALOT! Revenge?
Both those states vote Democrat period. Nothing to do w @POTUS. Graham/Cassidy belong to #PermanentPoliticalClass. They don't care abt that
To give millionaires  & billionaires tax cuts? The GOP is beyond repulsive!

Something is wrong when 1/2 the babies born are pd for by medicaid & 76% of children are on it. Maybe Medicaid funding isnt the issue?
That's 76% poor kids OF the 39% all children on Medicaid.
