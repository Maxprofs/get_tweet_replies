this is sports not war  Isis is winning that  in 22 countries now an growing   THAT "JV TEAM" KILLED 250K
Jeff Flake?  Your name fits you perfectly.
He is not referring to events as trivial as the Olympics. Its more about our cultural and economic slide.
clearly, those five make up for the 30% unemployed. @Reductress
There should be a petition to require all Gold medals to be made of solid gold.
Only in
athletics and that's because of
unity. TEAM, Together Each Accomplishes More!
team sports have individual aspects w/ cohesive common goal.Trump saying usa doesn't win is wrong" as Rio proves.
economy in the toilet but look! Lets melt these gold medals that WE won in the name of leftist lunacy and feed the poor.
Oh yeah, winning loads of metals at an athletic event proves definitively that the US is not Rome circa 400 AD.
DUDE SPORTS LMAO
The republicans that give fodder to the dems to hurt Trump should b voted out of office in November.
why do you refuse to support your party candidate? Why ruin AMERICA by letting Clinton choose Supreme Court justices?!
our athletes win, but our current government makes them pay taxes on their medals, etc.  Great support there government.
Only 2 choices that count 11/8 #Trump vs #Hillary It's that simple.
VOTE #TrumpPence16  #CrookedHillary
Quit watching the Olympics.  Your lawn looks like shit.  Go mow it.
Are you  so tired of all this winning that you can't take it anymore?
No need to make it great again... it already is.
Says the boomer...
Adults speaking and acting like children...you you know how sad you really are ? Smdh
Arizona surely doesn't win while you're representing us..
Not economically, but that is above your pay grade.
I guess the Democrat tweet went out to @JeffFlake too.  Lame. @Rio2016
smug remark that doesn't hold water
Maybe we win too much. Give the little guys a chance.
@Westlake only Republican I would vote for. #imwithher Trump the terrorist #trumpputin
@chucktodd Priceless
@chucktodd @Rio2016 Then explain darling, why 70% of Americans think the country is headed in wrong direction. 
@chucktodd @Rio2016 I just watched NBC turn Olympic women's gymnastics into a racial issue. WTF,  NBC???
Who said this? Oh, it's your cheap shot at Trump? AZ Reps won't forget your helping Hillary!
These five girls are a great example of what can be done if Washington is not involved!
Jeff please switch parties, be honest with yourself and the great people of AZ. I will not vote for you again!
msLSD LOWEST NEWS RATINGS EVER-chuck what say U-think 24/7 anti-TRUMP LIES not resonating-24-55 yrs. adults??
Or they tax their gold medals,  so the government can give it someone who didn't do the work to win them.
AZ America can win when the government doesn't get in the way! Wait until the EPA says they made too much chalk dust.
TRUMP WINS!-PUNDITS FACES-lol- WILLIAMS=liar-MADDOW=lie polar- MATTHEWS= drunk- all others=fired-Xanax-soiled
mslsd show goes after GABBY HARD ON USE OF HAND-MSNBC IS UN-WATCHABLE ANTI-TRUMP 24/7- SO BORING- GO TRUMP!!!
@chucktodd @Rio2016 dope...
Jamaica and South Africa win gold medals too, you obtuse fool. Not exactly doing so hot economically and socially.
@chucktodd 
Way to politicize our awesome Olympic team...I think you missed the point of primary results
Who said this? Oh, it's your cheap shot at Trump? People in AZ won't forget your helping Hillary!
We don't win any less either. What other country can say that ?
@chucktodd @Rio2016 ...
Where is Obama & Michelle on this ? Vacations have priority, now like their boots
Exactly! America is already great.. And as the pic shows, we are #STRONGERTOGETHER.
Now if only the attendees at a R event or rally could reflect the diversity of that team and America itself.
@DrewGodinich @Rio2016 Your party created the monster #DonaldTrump repudiate him more vocally
@DrewGodinich @Rio2016 Tell the asshole #DonaldTrump to stop tearing us down and dividing us
@realDonaldTrump Trump saying We don't WIN in Foreign Policy, Nat.Defense& Economy!He saysWe have WONDERFUL PEOPLE!GETit
Biased media!
You are part of the problem-clueless ivory tower elitist who doesn't give a damn about Americans-only your donors! #MAGA
Lowest home ownership 50 yrs-94MM out of workforce-stagnant wages-trillions in debt-crime rising-sure sounds great #MAGA
.@JeffFlake @Rio2016 is that Mexico, Africa, or Britain? Hard to tell because America isn't a nation.
Perfect.  Let's settle for winning vicariously through others in a low-stakes competition.
five young women in a competition doesn't compare to the ridiculous trade deals you vote for.  Stop obfuscating the issues.
Continuing to help Hillary and the illegal immigrants will still vote you out when her Supreme Court let's them vote.
Using Olympic athletes to make political jokes is in line with a Flake like Hillary.
make sure you do the same in the Senate. Time to cut spending and cut taxes.
@chucktodd @Rio2016 ....strength in diversity and teamwork!
@SenatorLeahy @Rio2016 American women are winning bigly. Biggest victory will come this November.
@DrZuhdiJasser @Rio2016 America won't be great until I'm running it! And I #MakeNAMBLAGreatAgain! #TaxesProveIt
@chucktodd @Rio2016 false equivalence, go ahead and switch to the  Dem Party JF while the favors are still for sale
@chucktodd @Rio2016 I'm sure he was referring to the Olympics, and not AT ALL the #economy, #trade, or foreign affairs...#dumb
@DrZuhdiJasser @Rio2016 More accurate: "America doesn't win anymore when bought-and-paid-for politicians are involved."
@realDonaldTrump 
not wining in Middle East wars, trades,not our Olimpic Athletes.70% says we'r going wrong direction.
Totally Tone Deaf.
@chucktodd    Looks like we're pretty great right now!!
@chucktodd @Rio2016 Love it!!
@dandrezner @Rio2016 Doesn't count for the Trumpkins; only 20% Aryan
Flake I'm a DEM I'll vote  2 keep U My Senator n AZ! When you stepped away from Trump.U got my vote.
He has stepped away. He has refused to endorse.
Ah, so that's what WE get in exch for redistributing OUR wealth around the world...bravo
@chucktodd @Rio2016 you got him with that, your so clever...that would be sarcasm
@chucktodd @Rio2016 Pretty sure we don't need to "Make America Great Again!!!!"
@chucktodd @Rio2016 Proves America is already 'great again'.
There's hope in our youth...we need to support and encourage them, esp. the non-athletes who have little.
@DrZuhdiJasser @Rio2016   Thank God the government had nothing to do with these winners. "They built that" W/ family and coaches
@chucktodd @Rio2016 We win when we're decent and smart enough to include Black and Brown Americans. A fact that drives some nuts.
notice you didn't call out men's gymnastics,have we demasculated American men?let's make them great again
@chucktodd @Rio2016 @DanScavino Wasupwithis...another Alinsky-speak lapdog leaping forward.
@chucktodd @Rio2016 doesn't win in trade and terrorism. Are those enough?
@chucktodd @Rio2016 maybe to  you, but a lot of the people don't think so
@chucktodd @Rio2016 But you are right Jeff and Chuck, these 5 girls, political hacks, the media elites and Hollywood are winning.
now if we could translate that to congressional action.
@chucktodd It's the kids in West Virginia, inner city Chicago, Detroit and other areas ruined by democrats that don't win.
@chucktodd @Rio2016 corrupt and unpatriotic politicians. The people fighting and competing (athletes and military) are winning.
@chucktodd @Rio2016 Of course DNCChuck Todd retweets this. He has his marching orders and is bought and paid for by the DNC.
You are part of the problem in gov. He obviously meant Economics, trade, small businesses ect. Try to keep up.
@chucktodd @Rio2016 Isn't that a Republican line?
@chucktodd @Rio2016
@chucktodd @Rio2016 shows the affect PED has on sports.
@chucktodd @Rio2016 how many did that get off welfare?
meaningless w/o Russia its as fake as @chucktodd
@chucktodd @Rio2016
flake is a fraud 2018
@chucktodd @Rio2016  Really? Now that's a non-sequitur to the serious discussion.
You would know. Your timeline is full of meaningless attacks on Clinton.
Meaningless only to #HillaryClinton-ites, but may be of concern to those that are not.
America does. Keep shouting down the fascist Trump. Liberals don't forget.  #ALiberalAlwaysPaysHisDebts
@chucktodd @Rio2016 trade, immigration, elitism, globalism, etc.
@chucktodd @Rio2016 Well said, gentlemen! Just like Dorothy, we had IT all the time... Just click your heels together 3 times...
when @realDonaldTrump is pres, "we will get tired of winning" then become losers.
don't be mad at trump.  Jeb is the one the forced Mitt out of the race.  Trump beat Jeb, end of story.  Get over it.
@DrZuhdiJasser @Rio2016 our Olympians work hard & love each other. They are America. We need more people like them.  #TeamUSA
& fewer corrupt politicians, who put their self-interest above that of the American people.
I see what you did there.
Well, getting past all the hate, you are exactly right. GO US OLYMPIANS!!!!!!
@DrZuhdiJasser @Rio2016 Dumb! One thing has nothing to do w/ the other
no just Republicans that fall short Jeff, not Americans. #DoYourJob #noFlake
Yep, I did hear that somewhere!
great we can win at sports, how about winning against terrorist, unemployment, illegal immigration, vote flake out 2018
So says the fake profile.
A diverse team making America shine in all their golden splendor. #USA
