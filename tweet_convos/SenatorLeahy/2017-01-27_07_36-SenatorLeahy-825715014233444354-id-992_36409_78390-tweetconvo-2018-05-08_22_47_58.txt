In an ideal world.  But we all know, studies often find what they are paid to find and there are many examples of that.
That is why we should only accept actual peer-reviewed scientific studies. @janetbfitzgeral @SenSanders
http://www.vox.com/2015/12/7/9865086/peer-review-science-problems … Get the picture?
Do you actually understand what peer-reviewed is? I reject widespread conspiracy theories. @janetbfitzgeral @SenSanders @voxdotcom
Of course there will be people who claim their research is peer-reviewed when it is not. @janetbfitzgeral @SenSanders @voxdotcom
That does not mean we should reject science. What is the alternative? Go with our gut feelings? @janetbfitzgeral @SenSanders @voxdotcom
These skeptical people won't have a problem with validity of science & peer reviewed studies if they need latest lifesaving cancer treatment
I just don't understand the anti-intellectual movement. @dmurrell3 @janetbfitzgeral @SenSanders @voxdotcom
@Write4Research  I'm afraid this is a misguided view of science. There are always alt facts, as well as alt interpret of facts.
You might be confusing "alt facts" with "uncertainty". V different. Interprtn of meaning can differ.
how about bacteria can't live in the stomach but now we know helibacteria has been found n cause of ulcer
Discovering bacteria in stomach was a new "fact" not an "alt" fact.
what's the difference?
1/ Fact: no bacteria has been discovered in the stomach. New fact: we have discovered bacteria in stomach.
2/"Bacteria cannot survive in stomach" is not a fact, its an assertion/model/theory. (And a falsifiable one)
2/ unless you're saying you're always right? Climate change. Relativity vs Quantum vs String. Evolution vs creation?
you realize scientific understandings regularly get reversed by future scientific findings... right?
Yes, but not seeing the evidence is different.
I mean, I spend a lot of time debating with vaxxers, climate hoax deniers, etc.
And a good part thinks the government or scientists skewed the data for profit.
And they mostly tend to have confirmation bias instead of assessing the data correctly.
Normally they are highly influenced by political beliefs instead of evidence or consensus.
Obviously, things like p-hacking and fake data exist, but that's why there is peer review.
Even in science the facts are blurry. Global warming a hoax as there is no model just extrapolation. I am fellow PhD
Science is subjective like everything else. U may have heard of Einstein?
@JLeung64 
Ur thoughts? I have yet to "adult" enough to understand the interplay b/t politics & science, but like BS' evidence-based idea.
just took it at face value w/o reading into it
Me too, but does  mean a good or bad? Twitter explains  as "Face screaming in fear". 
my bad ...was intending more of a cynical shocked emoji
"The thing about science is it's true whether you believe it or not." -Neil DeGrasse Tyson
.@SenSanders W. V. O. Quine says FALSE. http://www.ditext.com/quine/quine.html … #Philosophied #Quine #WheresYourEmpiricismNow
spoken like someone who doesn't understand science. It is full of calculations using estimates/assumption
There is simply no proof that science exists. You need to apologize for saying I can't survive basing things off Harry Potter
Too bad alarmists resorts to skewing data, and not allowing vetting of their models... that's the scientific method
Trump Lies... A.K.A. "Alt-Right Facts"
Another brilliant observation from Captain Obvious.
Yeah like a heartbeat is a sign of life... that science???
The environmental movement is a religion for marginalized socialists and communists."Climate change" is an attack on capitalism.

Society cannot survive without decisions based on Gods plan. Men cannot control God. Hurricanes proof. He is much bigger than Scientific theories. Just saying.Since beginning of time Climate  change.
well then the big boom is lacking since the universe was created before time and gravity existed
You mean like the evidence behind universal #basicincome & why it should be something you talk about just as much as healthcare?
This can be classified as alt news also, been debunked as it enslaves the population while removing basic rights.
It has not, and it does not. UBI is increased freedom.
@EMcCutchan Check out March for Science to support evidence-based policy! #ScienceMarch
Okay and those decisions should be what?
@s_sozzo  So you'll support battle against #Geoengineering #Chemtrails #Haarp? Fcts-analyses-data
Yet you deny science when it concerns your abortion agenda.  #CrazyHomelessHobo
ese modelo de ciencia atrasa. Los hechos son construidos!!
@R1chardatron There are alternative facts just as there is alternative evidence on which to base decisions.
problem is scientists massage their results. Their desire for glory is no different than anyone.. they lie
I get your point and support it even though science is wrong a lot!!
@Botanygeek @LDNsciencemarch Go Bernie! And thousands of us are planning to say the very same, publically in London soon.

@LaLaRueFrench75 @SenSanders @eTweeetz 
Why waste your time with Sen Sanders, he sold out.
He did. I'm not sure why. He still may be worth getting through to.
He sold out, means THEY have stuff on him so he CAN'T back out.Can't make a deal w/the devil
You are right, predictions are not facts. But clearly records are more close.
The corpus of knowledge has been getting a lot more accurate than the 70's.
Agreed. So where does ‘God bless America’ fit?
In personal values, guiding your own conduct?
You need a god to tell you how to act? OK. What if that contradicts the evidence presented?
As for conflicts with evidence, it depends on the issue, eg climate change: go with science, vs kosher food: doesn't matter
THANK YOU!
But, Hillary had "bad judgment" Bernie. How do you sleep at night?
.@brooklynwatch @sensanders had a right to run against @HillaryClinton and endorsed and campaigned for her to try to help her #StopTrump.
I did not question his "right" to run against her. He gave Trump a gift in his criticisms.
.@brooklynwatch Giving valid criticisms of @hillaryclinton was part of @sensanders running against her. He did nothing wrong.#StillSanders
He did nothing right.
None of this, and I mean none,negates the fact that we now have a madman in the WH. Fueled by "Hillary Hate".  Fait accomplis
@TheCarlWeathers I'll believe in climate change if u can show me some hard evidence to prove it's true and not a govt scheme.

They used alternative weather stations to show temp. increase, moved data sites from mountains to inter cities. Mann emails.
Even if it is fake science?
Science is a method.
Oui.
But not at the moment. It's being manipulated by the corrupt Global government to control the masses
Corrupt global government? Explain plz?
to complicated in tweets. US Imperialism, the CFR, the EU, perpetual War,  climate change, it's all part of the plan
Perpetual war? Is that a reference to 1984?
Yes. America has been at war since we invaded Iraq. Almost 15 years now. And with it a revival of Cold War philosophy.
Another point is the Two Party system dichotomy that has infected our minds. We do not have a two party system.
@MarthaHotz #CDCwhistleblower #vaxxed
Senator Sander's knows all to well about the corrupting influence of the 1%
but he still believes vaccine science is settled 
I'm trying to figure that out. I he just blind in this area or is it a pick you battles type of thing?
who knows????
I know. We will likely never know.
@PLOSBiology Here's a fact: only Pro climate change studies are funded.
...or... only rigorous studies tend to be funded, and they tend to show that climate change is ongoing. Hmmm.
I would like to see rigorous "scientific method" studies which strive to disprove specious theories.
No, #science is #bought. Conflicts of interest, #fraud, data manipulation & #publicationbias corrupt today's #vaccine #research
That #vaccine manufacturers are not liable for injuries & deaths perpetuates this problem. https://youtu.be/eP6v2f4ylpU  #VAXXED
@LaLaRueFrench75 @SenSanders One of the many reasons why to me, Reagan was NOT a good Prez
Still doing what he did before this election, advocating for what he feel is right.  Hardly a sellout.
proof?   He had a big hand in the platform dnc ran with, of course he was going to endorse it.
Not about allegiance to the party so much as allegiance to the platform, ideas.
I don't mean that, I mean that platform is closer to what he has advocated for most of life than the alternative.
Agreed. Do you accept the science on GMOs though?
@HeyLauraTurner so then you agree that the #boyscouts just made a big mistake
but to think Science is simply an objective pursuit with no subjective bias fuelling it is also a mistake
preach
what about when science is wrong
Trump doesn't do evidence, only fake news and propoganda from his rich friends and greedy family.
"just let people have fun! it's harmless!"
.@SenSanders  there is such a thing as bad science and corrupted science! @eTweeetz #vaxXed #science #scientists
.@SenSanders @eTweeetz here is an example of bad science https://vactivists.com/autism/on-autism-speaks-declaration-of-no-mmr-autism-link/ … #vaxXed
So why solar panels in Vermont?
it would be a great argument if you didn't merely dismiss science that disagrees with you Bernie. Open your mind to ALL science
@the_doktor  "science is science." Is something people say when the don't know what science is.
Science will never be accepted by those clinging to creationism and God not doctors saving lives. They believe in fairies ffsake
TRUMP IS CENSORING THE MEDIA BY DISCREDITING THEM TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. STOP MEDIA OPpressION. SUPPORT THE FREE PRESS!
If it is, Why the demonization of any opposing views? Debate doesn't exist with one-sided conversations.
@SenatorLeahy bannon has addressed that "science" by claiming it's a theory just like creationism. Think I'm lying? Look it up
@SenatorLeahy Right. I'm still waiting for the first display of purely objective and thorough evidence/data!
And yet:
Science is very important, but fails at taking into acount what can't be counted #Scientism
Un monument de scientisme ! La science est très importante, mais elle ne dit pas tout et reste aveugle à ce qui ne se mesure pas
@MarthaHotz science =When you can commit fraud and get away with it too. #vaxxed #CDCwhistleblower  not going away #autism
The original link has to his legal statement has been removed. Why the need to censor?
??? Don't get what you mean?
Google and Bing are censoring access to Dr William Thompson's legal statement. They don't want people (1
science is absolutely sure that it's never absolutely sure, so is Socrates, foundational philosophy.
we need you Uncle Bernie. Tell us what to do. We are here and ready.
We have WIKILEAKS.  I will not allow the Corporate Media to "interpret" facts for me....not after this past election.
agreed.  That's why I reject pseudo science of climate change and pseudo science of evolution
@alanaayala meet us at the rally bernie we  you

alternative facts are just lies. Sad Americans wonder if Trumps followere are that stupid.
al @ElGatoyLaCaja y @FabBallarini le gusta esto aguante la ciencia en todo el mundo
"A string of wet sponges"- David Berlinski-Science is full of empty claims, does science explain love, yawning, and evil? Nope.
Modern day pols who don mantle of & shout "science!" as slogan exactly like old-world warriors declaring God's on their side
Well...that's why I'm worried.
.@SenSanders thank you senator.
Keepin' it !
@MariaWelych idiot
@altUSEPA 
Why do we need Congress if one man can use executive orders to govern?
Congress has the power & constitutional duty to both enable and check presidential power. Power ceded is not power.
you know who's great? AltUSEPA! They've got great science. Great people. Science is real! Bigly.
Science is the backbone of society. With it millions of lives can be made better. Without, we are doomed to failure.
Good to hear you backing evidence based research. I'll be waiting to hear your statement supporting transgenic crops. #science
absolutely, science is science and 2+ 2 = 4.    There is no alternative answer
@altUSEPA Repeal and Replace Trump!
Guess it depends on WHO is paying for the research and what their agenda is as to what the outcome will be...
@ian_taplin Then start protests against trump! Stop talking!
I agree if it is not junk science using outdated computer models
God bless you www. Greene I http://warriors.org 
this man should have neen our president
@mwassermannl like, for example, the massive scientific evidence that proves any socialist economic model is unsustainable
I'd agree 100% if so much E-B research wasn't funded by unclean hands.  #badresearch
what talk lol?
yes
then why are you against GMOs??
Does this also apply to the science showing that GMOs are safe?
@shadesofdiana what other kind of research is there Bernie? Lol.
ALTERNATIVE FACTS
@danigrant what facts...the rich get richer and the poor keep helping them
how about the science that says GMO are perfectly safe?
Scientific facts are the real thing. Way to go Bernie!
@IrineuLoturco How about Expertise and Experience? Does it counts?
@dianeft Problem is,  with Repubs. they research until their research fits their definition or they'll continue researching!
you don't write your own tweets and you pander to millennials
@lala_kent the problem is who can you believe. Politicians? No thanks.
Perhaps you can invite Trump to Great Canyon and tell him law of gravity is an alternative fact...
you got that right, president Sanders.
@cpecinovsky 
.@SenSanders Your supporters don't seem to agree with you - B/W gap most well established result in psychology.
every period of history is modern in time scale...and civilization has survived..though without evidence.
In that case evidence shows that socialism has failed to deliver wealth to the people but delivers wealth to the ones in power..
120+million dead from the various forms of socialism is a fact. https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NOTE1.HTM …
Perhaps you can communicate this brilliant thought to the #climatechange and #GlobalWarming fakers!
what no way Conway meant was there are facts, Trump facts AND alternative facts. Btw. U should have been POTUS. HELP US
Out of context, this is only marginally helpful. Yes, science is science. So is the push and pull of different values.
over 50% of medical research paper findings cannot be replicated.  I suggest this is a place to start.
Chances of humanity surviving became considerably slimmer when Trump became president of the USA
@RA_Parker explain how you base scientific fact on such a small 136 year climate sample. It's a theory at best. Blink of an eye
we must end gerrymandering and start intelligence/education vetting on all public offices!
@bharathjairaj science is not science when used for political decision making. It is science of convinient evidence.
The phenomenon of "alternative facts" is created through confirmation bias or deliberate misrepresentation - like in this pic.
@Lanazinger pseudoscience still science is science? Follow the money and motives
this shouldn't be rocket science
Glad you're paying attention to science. Now how about taking on accounting and economics?
utopias also can't  exist in modern societies bud
Would be great if you could get your facts straight on religious extremism, too, though.
Yeah.  Too bad @SenSanders believes in "alternative facts" about economics.  Most of us live in the real world & remember history
@chrismlittle12 fake news
Republicans are busy crafting their plan to replace Obamacare. Early indications are that it will be called "Trumpnocare!"
Still Religion, Racism and Nationalism are enough powerful to overthrow Science. RIP Modernism
Alternative facts....there's only one set of those.
@jopackaj - unless one is Hegelian
alternative facts - Al Gore is a scientist.
you so worried about weather killing us, although you support the murder of millions of unborn children? #hellomcfly
what about the science that shows a heart beat in a women's womb? #DoubleStandsrds
juding from Wikileaks DNC/Podesta emails... using evidence based research... I'd say you got screwed
The problem is Bernie, you're not a scientist. So the truth is you wouldn't know a fact if it bit you on the ass.
@drmchivers remove what may be affecting the system. Just be careful to allow people to adjust
@drmchivers however in climate change I believe there is ample evidence. Intervention would be "via negativa
@drmchivers science is not enough and sometimes acting based on a few studies can lead to disaster.
human behaviour is a social construct : its research should be practice based @SenSanders
evidence placed b4 us by d DNC suggestd @HillaryClinton won d primaries, @Wikileaks providd "alternative fact"u were rigged out!
@FawnHoganMD too bad pro-choicers can't accept what the latest science reveals about about a fetus. That it's not 'just cells'
the scientific evidence points to 'this is human life'. Ppl like Sanders react as if it was a basketball in there
it is a fact @HillaryClinton was the DNC presidential candidate, the "alternative fact" is that d DNC rigged u out of the race!
@ithorpe I am a nurse. Evidence based practice is what we base our practice on. You are so right!
I thought there could be multiple solutions to a particular problem. so sad u didnt know grandpa. it is called alternative fact!
How is it possible we live in a world where you aren't our president?
.@SenSanders @Aquadria Academic today have no lesson to give,they're denying evidence fo cold fusion #LENR since 26y
Remember Bernie, you helped make this atrocity a reality by putting your own ambition above the greater good!
AMEN
the republicans don't like  the truth, they like the alternative facts, they hate science because the prove everything out.

Rubbish! Science must adhere to logic or its facts are nonsense. Our decisions about the res publica must stand amidst debate.
Yes.  American voters also despise bargain-basement "Public Opinions" that don't match the $250K "Private Opinions" #Sanders2020
time to build a ship and move into space.
Such as Hillary is a Crook...

@nrcplummer k this is dumb...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_controversial_issues#Science.2C_biology.2C_and_health …
Bernie, that's why evidence based medicine is so important to patient's welfare and clinical outcome.
so the science behind sex and race differences should be objectively and openly debated, right?
like science that have women becoming men or vice versa based on their feelings?

@charlieomalley Too bad your fans trashed Hillary based on unscientific hatred of GMOs.
science and common sense go hand in hand
that's right!
And I have a LOT of field evidence too.
evidence is an onion skin of time and proven fudged numbers , get out of your bubble.
There are no "alternative facts." The thousands of silenced scientists claiming the sun causes climate change must be wrong.
@SALMMLIK Reason Science. Galileo/Newton Physics don't work in USA. #9/11 #NewYork #IIIWW
evidence is one gallon of fuel will create vapor that is measured in PPM not pounds. One gallon weighs about 4.3 lbs as liquid.
Evolution is another Science Proclamation which is Baloney.
only science is nô human society we do spiritual
moderne société with only money and business? Nô spirituel
YES and further- thinking with facts, leads to sensible thinking, knowledge, logic. ability discovery.....
@cristinaprkr and just in case @realDonaldTrump is confused, the Wirld is not flat. It's true and not an alternative fact

100% is 100%, whatever others may say... RT ;-)
