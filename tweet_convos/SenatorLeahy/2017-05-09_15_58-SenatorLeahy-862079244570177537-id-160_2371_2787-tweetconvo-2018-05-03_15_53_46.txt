Thank You!
Pointing out..Sessions also recused himself in his confirmation hearing from Clinton/email cited in letters as their "reason"
Dems have no evidence to even start an investigation into Russian collusion. You are clinging to a weak argument to save your elect losses!
Thanks Mia, you are the best.
This is genuinely scary stuff. Getting rid of all who oppose him=dictator.
Well done sir!

Of course, if mishandling the Clinton investigation was actually the reason for Trump to fire Comey, he should have done it in January.
MISHANDLING MEANS  NOT JAILING HER.
Thank you Pat!
This is much worse than Nixonian
Watergate was "merely" one party spying on the other and the cover up...this is so much more dangerous!
Oh Please!! Save the BS and stop pandering for votes that will not come! Just last week you had no confidence, is your memory is failing?
But you fail to realize that they've thrown integrity out of the window into a trash fire.
Believe what you wish...it is done and Dir Comey was no longer right for that important job
Where is the proof of Russian collusion? Comey's boss was the one who recommend him being fired. If dems get diarrhea it's Trump's fault.
Trump can not continue to get away with this. We need patriots and checks and balances.

@sparkychick3233 It's not us you need to convince Paddy. It's the damn, bloody Republicans! NO BIZ w/@GOP UNTIL SP IS ENGAGED.
What are you scared of? The cover ups and lies you been telling? To cover up for obama and Hillary?
Republicans don't care,they just want this to go away at all costs.We are edging to a law less country.#
Forget the Special Prosecutor get these sick people out of office NOW
And how do you think that happens? With a special prosecutor.
I understand but don't need a special prosecutor to know that there are several impeachable offenses. Just the emoluments clause alone...
You clearly don't understand how the law actually works.
Hillary wanted Comey fired, Dems wanted Comey fired. Now he's fired and they are having a fit.
Tx -I knew from d beginning about need of special counselor w non-partisan proven record 4 #TrumpRussiaInvestigation @SenateDems @SenSchumer
thank you sir
BREAKING! Hillary Clinton was briefed by Putin! Look how intend she is-It must have been very important orders! psssst!
LOL.. she also gave him a gift of appreciation...uranium!
Thank you.
This requires an independent investigator into Trump campaign ties to Russia, posthaste.  Thanks
Trump is in cover up mode, We demand our Government to STAND up for the PEOPLE of the United States, Not RUSSIA!!!!!
@SarahSpain it's bad optics just like the tarmac meeting with Slick Willie and the AG. Please stop the insanity & help the USA
#impeachtrumppence #firesessions We demand an inde investigation and special prosecutor. #resist #trumprussia #gopcorruption
Yes we do! Into comey covering up for rice and Hillary and obama! Do it now!
Leahy called Comey out last Oct. Telling him he made "big mistakes" and ducked protocol. Now he's all Boo-Hoo.  #TwoFacedDem
Thank you, Senator Leahy.
Nothing less than Nixonian! We need a #SpecialProsecutor now to safeguard #ChecksAndBalances.
CC:@SenCoryGardner
Beautifully done Senator! Patriots r desperately needed during this national nightmare! We support & salute U! #comeyfired #russiagate
Thanks Senator!
Independent special prosecutor needed; constitutional crisis looming. No one is above the law; no one. Wed is big day for the US Senate.
Republicans are not defending our country from a dangerous man.  Why?  What can the people do? We need to do something!
Trump refuses to take Obama and Yates advice to fire Flynn for extremely egregious behavior but he does take the advice of Rosenstein on J.C
Officials investigating #TRUMPRUSSIA @SallyQYates @PreetBharara @JamesComeyFBI Officials fired by @POTUS Yates,Bharara & Comey #nixonian
Boy he sure wants to make the next 100 days very special. The best days.
So what are you going to do about it....
Well said!
Where & when did POTUS say he fired Comey because he was unfair to Crooked Hillary?...Just another Libtard DemoCrap talking point
The American people demand justice!!!
The Senator nailed every point.
@emullensemperfi
What 45 does not realize is that the American people are not nearly so gullible nor ill informed as he
Words r NOT enough sir we need action our democracy is at stake on your watch
disagree Senator...the most critical investigation of our national security was when the Sec. Of State used a Pvt. Server...
How DARE you insult Nixon with that comparison!
This appears to be obstruction of justice during an ongoing investigation
Thank you Senator Leahy for standing up! I don't see how we can allow decisions to b made for the USA by this administration
Ty Senator! Absolutely agreed!
Obstruction of justice Yes Senator thank you
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
Let's hope something can actually be done now. Who on earth does actually appoint a Special Prosecutor. The AG? Oh boy, that's a stretch.
Why is your picture in Jared's sister's China presentation?
Thank you, Senator!
Thanks for saying so
THIS IS A EXTREMELY DARK TIME FOR ALL AMERICAN'S
RULE OF LAW IS BACKBONE OF OUR DEMOCRACY!
TRUMP'S OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE
END OF STORY PERIOD!
With all due respect senator, your words are meaningless without the R in front of your name
I hope once this is all said & done our congress works like their jobs depend on it to make sure this clusterfuck never happens again.
PLEASE use your leadership to convince D & R senators to demand an independent counsel to take over Trump-Russia investigation
BREAKING: Sen. Leahy peddles hypocrisy as two of his US Attorney's covered up wholesale fraud at Brattleboro Retreat.#RiggedJustice #vtpoli
I don't recall Nixon ever firing the Director of the FBI.
We need to get 5 million people to the Washington Mall soon. I am thinking July 4 wd be a good Independent Prosecutor Day.
has appeared in 3 generations of Batman films. He knows about good and evil.
Just another moonbat!
Gaslighting at it's finest.
None of us do! Fight this tyranny before its too late.
So what now?
#TrickyDon
.@POTUS @realDonaldTrump is a disgrace to the nation and he is destroying our democracy! #impeachTrumpnow #SpecialProsecutor

Where is Trump tonight by the way. Any other night he would be embarrassing America tweeting. He such a coward!!!
Senator Leah, What are you going to do about it. Congress must act immediately.
Well Pat, this is an alarmist statement. Have you taken the time to view the classified docs on investigations? Investigations continue...
Me thinks the house of cards is starting to crumble. #TrumpRussia #ComeyFiring #IndependentInvestigation #TrumpRussiaCoverUp
Make this a reality. We should have a special prosecutor appointed by the end of the week.
Thank you, PJL and I hope we get a #SpecialProsecutor to investigate. Let's not forget #18days.
Special prosecutor!
Obstruct any nominee!
Impeach!
Didnt take you long to try use that line so predictable lol
Of course it's predictable. What kind of an idiot lets someone appoint the person who is supposed to investigate them. Oh yeah, Trumpsters.
His integrity... are at stake?
Senator Leahy are there and checks and balances that can rein the AG in?
Thank you
Thank you, Sen. Leahy!
#TrumpRussia
#TheResistance 
#ImpeachTrump
Screams "I'm guilty!!", right? @realDonaldTrump will clear everyone out of government who opposes his dictatorship - #textbookfascism
Trump needs to be impeached
@realDonaldTrump Firing #Comey was a yugely biglie mistake.Trump U are a LIAR and complicit in the Russian hacking and stole the Presidency
Read Sessions letter-Ending HRC investigation is reason for JC firing, right, not unfair treatment of here, right?
America should understand that dictatorships and coups are not something that they are immune from
#resist
Please appoint Sally Yates as independent counsel
.@realDonaldTrump Donnie - this is not good. You are acting irrationally and covering your tracks. This looks bad for you.
IMO, Trump has committed an impeachable offense!
What can we do we have alot of Senators kissing up to tRump. Just let me know I will do or write or come and march to get him out.
We want an #IndependentCommission
Thank you! Now, please do everything you can do get a special prosecutor appointed ASAP!
THEN START IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS!!!! His is OBVIOUSLY treasonous!!! Get his ass out NOW!!!!
Yes Senator, as a Vermonter I stand with you demanding a Special I dependent Prosecutor
We must have a special prosecuter and independent investigation. Obstruction on steroids is Nixonian.
Please help America!  We are exhausted...
AG Sessions is a FELON - we all saw it on LIVE TV. Why isn't he in PRISON???
Thank you.
he blew comey a kiss!   Seriously I've never seen a man do that to another man!  #impeach
Feel like I'm screaming into the void of space.
Thank you. This is insane behavior
Impeach.
They could possibly be ready to put #HillaryClinton  where she belongs
Sorry, they aren't able to put her in the White House, where she belongs. Great thought, though!
Please get them out of the White House. Our country is in danger.
This is disturbing.  Wouldn't his action be an obstruction of justice?  We need a special prosecutor now.
Don't just talk about it.  Do it!
Well done, Sir! Do not give up until there is an independent investigation!

Now that Comey is relieved of his FBI duties, he can join the Trump administration and be paid handsomely for his silence and loyalty.
Sanity rises.
Demand that there be an independent Investigator!
Problem is, you can't destroy what doesn't exist. Feinstein has stated publicly no evidence of collusion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB7lOGFBKXE&feature=youtu.be&t=9m43s â€¦
Hillary committed a crime , however she was given a free pass by this idiot though. Senator, You know Hillary was guilty yet u covered --
Words are cheap. Make it happen! Please!!!  
What has been shocking is the way the FBI has been run under James Comey!  Like the Key Stone Cops, disgraceful !
You are our only hope.  This is extremely serious
Thank you Sen Leahy. 
Thank you Senator, for your excellent representation of us here in VT on this urgent matter.

We need you to fight sir. Fight.
DEMS NEED TO START SHOUTING FROM ROOFTOPS FOR INDEPENDENT COMMISSION NOW #TrumpRussia #Russiagate #COMEY #FBI #CoverUp

What authority do you and others in the senate have in this situation
Nonsense. Nixon was under criminal investigation. Only one candidate under criminal probe in '16 - Hillary.
Counting on you to get to the bottom of this.
Shame on your GOP colleagues for not being outraged about this clear Nixonian purge of Comey amidst investigation into Trump-Russia ties
Thank you Senator! We MUST have a Special Prosecutor to complete the investigation of Russian interference in our elections.
