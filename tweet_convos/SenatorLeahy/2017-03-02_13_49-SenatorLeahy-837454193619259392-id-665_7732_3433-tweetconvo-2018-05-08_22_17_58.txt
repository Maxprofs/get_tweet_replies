It's too bad no one will be around to explain to the lifeless planet how Hillary would have been just as bad.
Seriously brother? No, she absolutely would NOT have been as bad...or nearly anywhere near bad.
No, not seriously. You didn't sense the sarcasm?
If we don't know you, how to tell? So, I'll follow you. Solved.
Fair enough!
I don't know you and it seemed obvious to me...for what it is worth.
For what it's worth you're like 55 hours behind. It's hashed out. But I hope you feel good about it.
I don't get people going out of their way to be rude.
Fuck that, that is unacceptable
jobs jobs jobs. But I wonder how many jobs will remain when the earth is not livable anymore?
Every year the cost of natural disaster raises (both in human lives & property), he sacrifices the future to show fast gains basically a con
Now this is SAD!
Always believed that the worst punishment 2 mete out 2 fam/friends was my absence. Not telling u what to do, but Does he deserve u?

Awwww.. one month of protection for Trump Tower occupants.
Congrats, @DrJillStein 
cuz its all Jill Stein's fault and not Hillary's, right?
Nope... but the dopes who voted for that moron (Stein ) get some blame for sure.
the lions share of the blame should go to hilary and the dnc.
proven the scientific bunch used false facts to sell climate change,  epa needs to get back to enforcing reg. Which is their job
Of course spew false facts. Don't believe the science that population, industry & fossil fuels impact the earth.
the science got caught using false facts, it's like the media too much false info you stop listening, now science lies
Phew, well at least the newly-approved Cabinet Secretaries can talk some sense into Trump...wait what's that? They're #climate deniers TOO?
if you care, give this a watch.
@ProfMike_M http://docs.house.gov/meetings/GO/GO00/20140625/102437/HHRG-113-GO00-Transcript-20140625.pdf … this is why I would bet. More funding = more corruption. They haven't proved efficient.
Has the military been efficient then? Over 50 billion more.
https://youtu.be/sk0tm4U1jss?t=1h21m38s … obviously the previous admin mismanaged that too. 100b tax dollars gone.
Great!  A total waste of money.
. Crazy. The savings will just about cover the Trumpf mob's security costs!
this should not be a surprise, considering who now heads the EPA.
Yes!
How about cutting it a little more? Maybe then the EPA will act more responsibly.
Twitler and the Trussians are taking down our great country with ridiculous exec orders and bills.  STOP THE MADNESS NOW!
Who needs clean air. The motto of .@realDonaldTrump is after me the deluge... who cares just destroy it all. #Resist
FFS!!!!!! 15 mill that chump has spent weekending at his trashy dump could have gone towards the EPA! #TheResistance #trump #resist
Which will go to NASA to find us a new planet..............amirite or no
Within a few centuries the planet will be rendered inhospitable for human life -- "human society" is in a suicide pact
#humanrights
What is wrong with EPA under the current President? Please, people...wake up or lose big in this already volitile climate.
to keep enough money.to protect 3rd wife in NYC and golf vacations
that's enough money to buy one of trumps golf resorts. 29 mil is the total US investment in climate change science?
@NaomiAKlein maybe it's better we all go quickly rather than choke on dirtier and dirty water
this means he is saving ~$70M and for what? Oh yeah for more military spend! #insaneinthemembrane
So tax payer money has been repurposed from saving the future of the human race to letting Barron finish school in NY
so bc of Trump we're all doomed. 
No greens anymore, 
no animals and no arts...
I'll go live on one of the 7 new planets and paint!
sad dau 
If we have  History...Survival of the species...Their attempt will not be judged well! They are just giving up!!
@nymelb86 does Trump realize that this will accelerate extreme storms costing billions of dollars in recovery???
repubs using lyrics to "we are young" as policy. Spoiler: "So let's set the world on fire" = hyperbole. Don't set world on fire.
Apparently they want to end our country and probably the world.
Scientific consensus be damned, I guess.
Um, Just... Wow. Absolutely Terrifying.
JUST IN: White House EPA budget proposal cuts climate protection program 70 percent to $29 million - source
Sure it's not 17%?
@cltomlinson Wonder what the Las Vegas betting line the EPA will be eliminated by or before mid-term (2018). Sigh
@maggieNYT there goes the planet
cause that's a great idea after it was 70-plus on the East Coast in Feb
.@Reuters Screwing over Mother Nature is a terrible idea. Their imaginary God is no match for a real universal force.
Well good bye endangered animals, national parks, clean rivers, safe air, and oh life as we know it!
I like your news but looks like we're heading to World War III
I can't believe the Republicans are just going to do away with everything that makes our country great
yeah because who really needs the planet?
@AnnTruwe burn it all down
who needs a stinkin' climate?
We are all headed for destruction, aren't we?
@maggieNYT That's the Mar a lago weekend slush fund. @realDonaldTrump is 70, what does he need climate protection for?
we're dead.
me thinking about how we're gonna die
Is this a problem.will my children need air, water, & o-zone 2survive or something..settle down...the war industry needs some love.
and Trump has spent 12m at Mar A Lago
@Ting_Wha ugh...welcome to the new Smog America...
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @CNN @ABC @CBSNews Did anyone ever read this book?http://www.rachelcarson.org/SilentSpring.aspx#.WLmld5F5ngo.twitter …
So it begins. He will strip away all the protections our environment has so the rich can get richer.
America First.  Earth near bottom of list.  #sadface #epa
how SAD and shortsighted
more money for bombs, people don't want to save the planet anyways, rather eat a burger. 29 million spent too much.
in other words, "this ice isn't melting fast enough, damnit!"
and here I thought a 25% cut was bad... 70%!? Terrible news.

@GerryConnolly @DonBeyerVA @timkaine @SenateDems
the money to fly fuck face to Florida every weekend has to come from somewhere 
Not to sound dumb, but how does the EPA not have enough money to protect against climate change with 29 million dollars?

so who will be responsible for cleaning the spills,filtering water, providing gas masks?If the planet  dies, so do humans.Worried?
@POTUS has repeatedly said that climate change is as 'hoax'. Which begs the question, why spend $29 mil on it?
@maggieNYT It's so ridiculous that it's laughable. Now the heck could anyone think this is a good thing?
What do these RePUGLICANS think they're leaving for THEIR Grandkids? A Wasteland of NoWater,NoCoastalLandNoCleanAir,DEAD PLANET!
@maggieNYT Can they blow up the planet in 4yrs? Or will we survive. Screwy American politics. Reverse every thing the other guy did
The Trump administration is just trying to find however way possible to make the world an even worse place.
EPA cuts are WRONG, WRONG, WRONG! We're all going to be Flint.
makes sense because it's part of the trump hate machine
@cornboy yes esp. bc U.S. has emitted more greenhouse gasses/pollutants in air, sea & on land than any other country cumulatively!
might as well call it the environmental pollution agency now. Because this admin doesn't give a damn about the environment.
@maggieNYT sickening!
wonder how much of this budget was administrative cost? Why not report this item?
$ Security for Melania + Barron in NY > $ for climate protection program
@maggieNYT Chomsky: Republicans were a direct threat to the world. Dont blame Republican voters, blame Russilicans they did this.
Got to hope China, with its push for renewables, can save the world. Who would have thought?
Guess they won't need climate protection as they pour coal dust in our rivers and kill the endangered species act. SMH. 
...yet 45 speech on Tuesday spoke about clean water and air? Do you think he was lying to America?
“@Reuters: JUST IN: White House EPA budget proposal cuts climate protection program 70 percent to $29 million - source” OMG  @potus
Who the hell is OK with this?REALLY. I want to meet you. This is BEYOND irresponsible!@ least we will have a bloated military &wall
@maggieNYT what a surprise!!?? Fake videos of melting ice caps in Antarctica were obviously ignored
@maggieNYT Rich billionaires wallets first..... #RichAmericansFirst  #MAGAMyAss
@maggieNYT because the GOP just loves acid rain!
What was that "pivot" point the media was saying after his speech the other day? Sad- he actually got people's hopes up.
that's like paying a person minimum wage for 40h week and not expecting them to need gov assistance. hw will @EPA fight cc w/that?
This is troubling. We do need to help the environment + acknowledge our carbon footprint.
this stuff would be depressing if I did not have kids. As is I just keep getting more and more scared about what future awaits the.
this is frightening. we're all going to be dead by the time this administration swaths and burns everything.
That's what you get when you appoint an EPA head that wants to dissolve the EPA. Hope Trump supporters don't have kids. #nofuture
real news and wtf
@randyprine @POTUS gutting our frontline defense against polluters that threaten our survival
we spend 29 million on what.
Let's all go to Donny's house when SHTF.
Thank you Trump supporters for destroying people's livlihood just because you were to ignorant to realize you were being conned
It's like the Reagan years, except that this President is a terrible actor and can't manage his addictions.

Hey who needs climate protection. Man doesn't need the Earth to live..according to morons from the GOP!
@s_rsantorini630 The #GOP &tRump hate our children, our future, the Democratic process & all the things American; they should USSR
70% cut. At this point they should just remove the word "Environmental" and replace it with "Big Business"
good that probably 20 million to much but it's a start !!!!!
I think there's a real argument to be made that the $500 billion+ spent on defense would be better served saving be environment...
start planting a shit load of trees. We're going to need them.
#drumph administration will kill us with bad water, bad food, bad air. We are in deep sh!t with this one.
redirecting the money to Armageddon bunker-building in Montana for the 1%?
For perspective, California's climate protection budget 2016-17: $310 million
Here comes the money for the wall... #epa
Climate?  We don't need no stinking climate! Bears can swim...
What a ship of fools! Help destroy the planet for money's sake. Money worth Nada if we can't breathe, drink, survive.
@lskurrus And it was 63 degrees in Antarctica this week. That is a true statement.
Sad!
soooooooooooooooooo in other words... Kirk Cousins will get more money than the EPA.... Maybe mother nature should be a QB
Good, our military needs to be rebuilt
.@Reuters and the dinosaurs are reassigning the funding to fossil fuels
FIGHT!
this will not pass. Get ready for a massive increase of calls and protests. I am not taking getting poisoned lying down #resist
@CNNPolitics @nytimes Can we please start covering what the Trump admin is doing to the EPA? Seriously media! Dont get side tracked
That is to much.
Good start! Fake science anyway. Should have cut it 100%!

A collective sigh is crossing the planet. We cannot help but wonder if #Trump can read
And for our Canadian neighbors, check details on loss of funding for Great Lakes protections and research. Freshwater
@NaomiAKlein well, at least when people start getting sick, there will be affordable health care.

No?
Pruitt is a danger to our society and to our children who will have to live with his destructiveness for many many years.
We are all going to die.
Cut the cash flow to research institutions and we will get more honest feedback on what is really happening in the climate.
oh. my. god.
hey @SusanSarandon & #Bernieorbust voters. How you feeling now?
if true its about time!!!
Trump desperately tries to gain acceptance from actual billionaires by giving them the planet and our lives to exploit.
The Republicans call themselves pro-life, but they aren't. They're pro-deadly diseases that more of us will get due to these cuts.
#USA @EPAScottPruitt

Scott Pruitt is the right person for the job as head of the #EPA.
@SteveSGoddard "Man Made Climate Change" is a fraud.

See the brilliant work by Steven Goddard.
@POTUS We should build that wall, but around our coasts. We're gonna need them to keep the water out:/
@michikokakutani Why are the Republicans just so damn evil? Is $$ really that blinding? Don't they have grandkids they care about?
“@Reuters: JUST IN: White House EPA budget proposal cuts climate protection program 70 percent to $29 million - source” this suuuuuucckkssss
Don't worry. Augmented reality goggles will soon make the streams and sky look as clear as can be.
U.S. spends $440 million per hour 24x365. Do the math.  Vote for priorities!!
tz
EPA will now put environmental protection out in long grass no funding.  "Chinese plot" isn't going away, climate change is here...
The @potus is trying to drown the liberal coasts.
keep denying, and we will leave nothing for my 14 beautiful grandchildren
Waa
Sun is less active now, oceans still have some heat but in 5 years or so, colder Earth
what is the rationale???
And if you want a colder earth, don't worry, you will get you wish soon enough. Co2 will continue to rise but Earth will cool, soon
Anthropogenic global warming = Chicken Little
There's till $29 million in waste left?! Uughhh...
I feel bad for all of you who really are brainwashed by liberal colleges, etc
Sad that so many believe global warming is going to kill us when in reality we have terrorists, drug cartels who are threats NOW
