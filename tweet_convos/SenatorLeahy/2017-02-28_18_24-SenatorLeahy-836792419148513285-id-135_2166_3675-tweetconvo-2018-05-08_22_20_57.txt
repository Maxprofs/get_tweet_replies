@ImpactDemocracy i don't give rat's ass who pays for the wall. Just build it!
yes because all of us hispanics are so scary!
0 to do w/ that. I've lived in Hispanic community most of my life. Costs in welfare, PA, crime
the only problem with your argument is a lack of supporting facts. State statistics please.
all relevant facts state the opposite. All my life have heard same argument with no facts
the constant reference to non existent basic human fears of an entire set of people is...
dehumanizing. This in turn allows the oppression and marginalizing of a part of our country.
illegal = illegal. Understand, if I was them, I would want to be here too. Still illegal.
@RodhamHouseRule think a confidential 'deal' could have been made? Ultimately they have no choice if we decide 2 withhold $$
@RodhamHouseRule Use UR Brain..would Mexican pres want any agreement 2 become public?  we simply withhold US charity $ 2 Mex
I heard he's giving them Texas! LOL!
I'm no Trump fan at all but of course he didn't ever mean literally they would pay 4 it but through import
we should not have to either
You gotta check in with @Lawrence on this- "Little Enrique" made @realDonaldTrump shut up! And it's fabulous!! =1  =0
We need/want good healthcare, we won't get it. We don't want/need a wall, we'll be forced to pay for it. Freedom? Think not.
@jbut1956ler since the Mexican president told him to piss off
@AltUSPressSec. Can't wait for the wall to be built to keep the Slugs out of our country
stop being #BLINDSIDED by "WALL TRASH"! "STAY FOCUSED PEOPLE" #TRUMPPUTIN is the real ball game #WatchasWellasListen @maddow
sooner or later you have to admit to your child that there is no tooth fairy, just saying
But Pence did it today in Good Morning America. @GMA
@DavidCornDC Pence just said yesterday that Mexico is paying for the wall
, If he wants the wall.. We'll gladly pay him with nachos!
yeah but they are instituting a 20 percent import tax
Except at his inane 2020 campaign"rallies"
make up more lies.If you say them long enough you may start to believe them yourself
Could we sell Texas to pay for the wall?
yeah because they made an agreement to make no public comments about payment for the wall. Not breaking any news here bud.
@MSNBC @DavidCornDC 
That's because the Mexican president gave him a spanking & send him home W/a limp. Now we pay for it.
he is a liar.  We need to keep repeating that simple truth.  #Trumprussia
Question remains: Will he impose a border tax/tariff and then falsely claim that makes Mexico pay for wall?
Let the 'build the wall' chanters pay and when Mexico pays back they get reimbursed. Simple enough 
probably have made a deal. Mexico takes back illegals for no wall bill.
@AltUSFWS Maybe Mexico has some vid of Trump getting pissed on by a gay mariachi band.
-LIES LIES LIES LIES LIES LIES LIES LIES LIES LIES.  At least he IS consistent as the leader of Trumpistan
-NOT WITH OUR $$$ Jerkoff. Congress CAN NOT APPROVE, or they can all move home!
there taking health care away and rain taxes on the poor
anyone who actually thought Mexico was going to pay for a wall got conned.
Looks like Trump's Mexican border wall proposal went south...BIGTIME!
@randyprine he said the taxpayers will be paying for it and that Mexico will be paying us back they said NOT REPEATEDLY
Amazing what happens when you stand up to a bully.
He needs a few more punches to the gut.
@MaxBoot Imagine the United States begging for welfare from Mexico to build US infrastructure. Sad!
@jackhutton it's called negotiating. Just like personal responsibility something liberals can't comprehend.
apparently you have the same trouble with fiscal responsibility.
@christinawilkie now he just has @VP so it
Mike Pence: Mexico will pay for the wall http://hill.cm/wxPnn0e  
@SadBeth1 I have noted that.
@DavidCornDC take away our healthcare but build a damn wall
they need to get a list of all Trump supporters and make them pay for the stupid wall
And the Republican tea people won't call him out on it.
yeah because he's going to make the American people pay for it.
@georgezab 
I'm no mathematician but sums don't add up...I foresee large tax increases 4 joe public or his bank will go bust
@AnnCoulter @michellemalkin @rosierifka @soledadobrien
Speech was muted camp speech. Vouchers 4 schools, immig cause all crime, tariff wars. End 'trivial wars' w/ Ds & press?
the phone call where the Mexican president explicitly asked him to stop publicly discussing it? That one?
tough guy got punched in the nose--true bully who backs down when challenged or  blames someone else
@AltHVNP b/c it was always just c'paign bs, better spend=re-train deplora coal ppl trump lied to #unfit #LongConDon
or he's tired of getting his ass kicked in tweet format lmao
@DavidCornDC the Russians must hv shared some secrets with their Mexicans counterparts making trump very nervous
@KaraCalavera Wall-add to long list of Trump's dumb expensive ideas. That is his forte.
@NOTaNastyWoman2 put motion detectors with military maneuvers to catch & return as to train military 24 hours cheaper folks
I've seen enough of Trump's style to realize it was always exaggeration. His point was: cost won't be painful.
He's considering the Baldwin stunt from SNL and asking for a credit card #
@NOTaNastyWoman2 remember he said part will be see through he just realized the wall is really complicated like insurance is
Taxpayers will pay for the damn wall twice: in taxes and at the grocery store.
@DavidCornDCThe ability for him to stick to a TelePrompTer 4 an hour without going off script was remarkable-4 a 6 yr old.
meds ?
@DavidCornDC wake up America.. we are paying
@gmarie55 There will be no wall. The cost of STARTING the wall will fall on us. It will never be completed.
border agents want a fence, so that might still be forthcoming.
@NOTaNastyWoman2 crickets... no mention of wall. USA needs Schools, healthcare, bridges. We don't need USA to pay for wall.
Didn't you hear? Trump is going to get Mexico to pay for all of that stuff too!
good ideal love trumps wall fund $ if you love Trump & want the wall $25 will be deducted each pay
Well no shit.
and the 20% tariff is pretty much gone too after folk from TX, NM, AZ, CA told him to stuff it.
@Amarillotxsguy if his fans don't hold him accountable why bother? No cares that he is chanting "lock her up" anymore.
@nikangel39
@Rosie so build a wall, guess none of the ppl that support  that will be going to all inclusive Mexico resorts -
is that really all you have to say? Nothing about the total disrespect that was shown?
@AltHVNP Really? That's an interesting development. It was a stupid claim to make to begin with.
@Rosie shocking. Its not practical.
@Rosie 10 Billion dollar wall beaten by a $50 dollar ladder. Who would have thunk. Not trump.
20.5 billion dollar wall. Beat by a shovel as well.
And who's going to pay for the Wall?  Can we please have a Normal, responsible, fairly honest Pres.
@Rosie he also is no longer pursuing an investigation into millions of people who illegally voted for "her". Memba dat?
@Rosie if you think that wall will not come down...well..I will not be denied avocados.
@Rosie it's going to be a great great Wall. A fantastic wall all other walls are a disaster!
Well Woop-de-Fucking-Doo!
@Rosie Let's face it he has no idea how to pay for any of this. Because math.
yeah you need a border vacation.  Better yet put your self in the shoes of a high school graduate, on the street with no job
his followers dont care, they want to increase the National Debt
America will pay for it.  Along with that other $ that he is wasting .  I'm not paying for it either.  FUCK HIM and his WALL
they'll pay for our healthcare though right??
@mitchellreports Why would he cite specific provisions of a deal while the negotiation is still taking place? That's stupid.
@now7grandkids the only thing the wall will do is destroy the economy of border cities
it will make things very expensive
@mitchellreports so, how's it going to be paid?
Guess who is paying for the wall? The same people who are paying @realDonaldTrump's salary for tweeting hatred. We
. Or since Paul Ryan started giving him back rubs.
Put Trump and his passel of sperm-idiots who seem to need jobs (on horses at the border)Train his pussy sons to "work"
@mitchellreports They're going to pay for it. Remittance tax, border tax....they will pay. They don't have to agree. Got it?
then companies raise the price on the shelves and we still pay for it. Got it.
@SenatorLeahy Think the grim presser Tillerson & Kelly had w/the Mexican Foreign & Defense Ministers may have been a hint
@mitchellreports yeah...didn't notice that. I wonder if it'll ever get built 
@mitchellreports I'm watching the price of my Chiquita bananas from now on!
@mitchellreports The wall is a waste of $. And Mexico was never going to pay for it - another stupid applause line. #resist
@mitchellreports , could give two shits who pays for it, trump should start a go fund me for the wall, 65 million would give
he got 62 million votes and the wall is 20.5 billion.  Good luck. Dumb comment.
@mitchellreports if there is a wall built ... we will pay for it ... and it is a waste of money !
Ya & Neither is USA let the orange idiot pay for it!!
@mitchellreports If he keeps on MX will pay for the wall just to keep Americans out.
@mitchellreports Watch the foreign aid earmarked for Mexico be the wall funding.
LOSER
Because the call convinced him otherwise? Get real, Kessler.
As I understand it that phone call was less than cordial
Yeah, I'll be paying for it!!! Mr. Former-Middle-Class-Killed-By-Jr.'s/GOP-Recession Taxpayer.
@angieptaylor clearly he just found out the difference between Mexico and New Mexico.
@MichelleMeach16 so we have to pay for his stupid wall ?#resist
In the wise words of former Presidente Vincente Fox, I'm not paying for that F***ing wall.
Just tax remittances. Easy.
@nberlat Ha ha!!!
@ImpactDemocracy and Ryan laughed... watch it again.
@mirandan247 that rfp though
@Smillican can I retweet this more than once?
probably cuz they agreed not to discuss Mexico paying for the wall publicly
and we don't care one little bit!!!!
@ImpactDemocracy yep.  But it will be ignored.  All the talk will be about how Trump gave a "great speech".
Nw you are beginning to understand. Good girl!
exceptionally frustrating!
Let's put a highway on top of it!
can there be a taco stand on the highway please
