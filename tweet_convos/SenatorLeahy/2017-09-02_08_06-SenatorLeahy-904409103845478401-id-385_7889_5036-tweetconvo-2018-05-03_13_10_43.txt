#Irma #
#Media POLLS LIE! BWAHAHAHA!
...SAID #TRUMP WAS LOSING ELECTION!
Wake up and STOP THE LIES!!
Polls were right. He lost nat'ly by 2.5pt. Polls missed in MI,OH,PA. That's it. But sure, ignore Irma cuz you don't understand probability.
maybe russia interfered in them 2!who knows trump disbanded the agency that investigates that. he also isn't protecting us from it again
If DACA students graduate they pass CitzenshipTest All Amer Children do in school, why are they not considered citizens?
citizenship is defined n the constitution. DACA circumvents that. Change the constitution. There is a process 4 that.
DACA doesn't give citizenship, only temporary legal status which gets reviewed every 2 years. Have to keep clean record to be eligible.
daca policy puts them in limbo. Bad policy. Every Obama said many times that he couldn't do it legally.
It's up to Congress to change it. Hope they do their job in 6months .
I don't have a problem with Daca recipients. Just the way it was done. Trump kinda did them a favor.
Agreed...kinda...but can Congress get it done in 6 months? They don't usually work that fast.
I hope. But if not Trump said he would revisit
I still don't understand why 90% of Americans allow themselves to be ruled by 10% of an elligitamate administration.
I ALWAYS WONDERED THAT FROM
2008-2016! Thank God its OVER!!
Is that the same polls that had Hillary Clinton winning #POTUS #MAGA #AMJoy
I hope they didnt use one of those polling orgs that said Hillary was going to win in a landslide
OF COURSE THEY DID!! FOOLS. 
#MAGA2020 
Sorry but WTH does it matter when the 30% seem to be running the country?!? I feel like the CHIEF looking at US w/a tear running down my eye
My guess is 80% or more of "Americans" don't even know what DACA CaCa stands for.
ANOTHER FAKE POLL. THIS MUST HAVE BEEN TAKEN HALF OF THE AMERICANS WHO DON'T WORK AND LIVE OFF THE TAXES OF THE AMERICANS WHO DO WORK
It's not about doing good it's about black and white white people don't want this country to turn brown guess what it's too late
Better than 35% garner by Trump. He’s toast in 2018.
Deport all 11 million and build the wall
Unfortunately that 30% have the power and 0% humanity and intelligence.
Polling of the MSLSD staff.
These young people have been vetted, what is the problem? Put their trust in the government. My heart 
How many in 8 years have become citizens?  If not citizen should not have access to Govt medical subsidies SS Med even if pay in.
DACA recipients do not receive SS or Medicaid, but they do contribute to it. DACA started 5 years ago not 8.
I support Americans first. Not illegal immigrants. End #DACA
They are Americans. They had no choice in being here and this is the only country they know. They make the USA better. #SaveDACA
Dreamers have to meet strict requirements to be in program, including having a spotless criminal record.

Paramedic with DACA status spent six days straight rescuing Harvey victims. https://www.buzzfeed.com/adolfoflores/daca-rescuer-hurricane-harvey?bftwnews&utm_term=4ldqpgc#4ldqpgc …
Another American job taken by an illegal alien.
It's @realDonaldTrump's base that oppose #daca.  None of that matters, though, because trump is against daca because Obama created it.
How sad 30% oppose. Who are these heartless people, do they not understand these were children brought here by their parents in hopes if
Deport them ungrateful illegals
Yea only polled Calif and New York? Fake polls! LMAO
But Trump only cares about he 30% !
Your poll is false just like they were on election night and all of 2016  #MAGA @WhiteHouse @seanhannity
citizenship is defined n the constitution. DACA circumvents that and is illegal
NO we don't! Shame on you @MSNBC for airing LIES #MAGA @SarahHSandiers @WhiteHouse @seanhannity @OANN @PressSec @greggutfeld @TuckerCarlson
No they don't Joy fake news
@Indivisible_OR
And 34% support Trump. I wonder who opposes DACA?
I wasn't asked, but I support #DACA & #AmericanDreamers 
I believe number of people who support #DACA is higher than 64%. Retweet if you do
Joy, ur one of the most currupted so called journalist. U say whatever the highest bidder is paying u 2tell. Focus on poor US black kids 1st
maybe 64% of the idiots in your circle
All reasonable people support DACA! Dreamers are here without having a choice. It takes selfish evil people to support deporting dreamers!
All you have to do is put yourself in their shoes! There is no longer a question.
2/3 of the nation oppose Trump, and 2/3 favor DACA. Just a coincidence? We have 1/3 ruling the country. What is Democratic about that?
Almost mirrors the current approve/disapprove numbers.
Racism: Hating ppl who have different skin.

Also racism: Wanting their kids who grew up American to suffer.
#SaveDACA
This means we have to educate 46% of America! That's about the entire Trumpholes
@realDonaldTrump You are on the WRONG side of AMERICA and history... RESIGN TRAITOR!
Anda the other sixa percenta  thinka you seea da daca whena you gotta sora throata. Sorry, couldn'ta resista.
@Only_Sn0wman I am the majority. And I will fight for the dreamers. No longer will I allow trumps base to dictate the terms!
Trumps going to sell dreamers to Congress for funds to pay for wall. This is why you can't run the country like a business. #ImpeachTrumpNow
Hahaha...a poll by MSNBC. The opposite is true.
Send the Mexicans back to Mexico. Mecico sure as hell wouldn't support illegal USA citizens in Mexico.
@Rosenchild trump doesn't care
Donald J. #Trump is Loyal to #Russian President Putin and Putin said he would RETALIATE for the Diplomatic Sites the U.S. took away.
No!
Yep. Bye "minister" Martha. Too depressing to see that judgemental, bigoted people are citizens of my country.
Trump is taking his hate out on the most vulnerable the children. He is cruel and cold blooded.
Are you trying to confuse the Mensas with data?

Allies will respond to DACA repeal. Clergy, attorneys, and lay people who want to help: pls contact us www. http://sanctuarynowlv.org 
These numbers sound familiar
#SaveDACA
...and @HillaryClinton won the popular vote...how'd that work out for ya? 
that trump is always against the majority, he only likes to bother, he hates the fact that we don't love him, doesn't have a redeeming value

Is it hard to get citizenship?  Because it does sound neglectful on the parents part. I've been educating myself about DACA & I support it
Polls were tampered with and twisted!
#AMJoy 
64% of Americans support #DACA is bullshit. Same pollsters said Hillary  was going to win the election
That poll is bullshit.
Anybody opposing DACA either doesn't understand the policy, or is totally devoid of humanity.  Trump likely fits both categories.
The The KKKoolaid base must be fed red meat regularly. #DACA
That's FAKE NEWS!!
I'm learning more about DACA. It's fair. My question is what happens when they age out? Get Visas, Green Cards or Citizenship?
Hopefully Congress will address that issue! Dems have been trying but the RETARDS resist!
SurveyMonkey/NBC polls are my 'go to' sources for data about what people are thinking. My 12 year old daughter swears by them as well.
@timekeeper1346 all presidents men !
Almost same as deplorable and enlightened!
Do Latin nations have #DACA like programs Joy? Looks like Mexico certainly doesn't... so why should we?
90% want background checks on every gun sale, yet here we are. Fight elevation hacking, voter suppression, #CitizensUnited and pls #GOTV2018
#FakePoll
Yes
Hey @realDonaldTrump, are you listening?
HEY 45 LEAVE THOSE KIDS ALONE! #SnowFlakeAvalanche #45resign #25thAmendment
Once again, a easily manipulated poll to which ANYONE can reply including illegals.
Since DECA kids make good grades,  have never been in trouble with law , how many of the 30% can say that about their kids??
But what does the Electoral College think.
You ever notice, it's always the same tiny 30% that have followed tRump from the beginning? Sad really
Why should the children pay for their parent's actions?  They contribute to this nation of all immigrants.
Why do you always show pictures of children in posts regarding DACA yet most of them are 25 -31 years old? Stunted growth, maybe?
#DACA is good for the country - so of course @realDonaldTrump will do the wrong thing and kill it.  #WorstPresidentEver #NeverVoteRepublican
The same 30% that will always blindly follow Donald.  #DACA
#DefendDACA these young Americans are just as American as anyone!
The poll is meaningless when 100% of those samples are liberal democrats.
POLLING SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT 64% SUPPORT #DACA & 30% #Racist!
Polls mean jack shit,especially from a shit house like MSNBC
That is hilarious, we all know who the 64 & 30 are.
Who cares if 100% support it? Congress makes laws. If you want #DACA then congress should legislate. Exec overreach not the answer #Liberty
https://twitter.com/1trump2016fan7/status/903067801035751426/video/1 … Devasted Moms whose Kids have been slaughtered by Illegals&Dreamers 
protest @SpeakerRyan Liberalism #DACA #EndDACA
I support citizens and legal immigrants, not law breakers.  No daca no amnesty.
Why would anyone oppose?? I just don't understand....
Let's do a poll of the people who don't have jobs due to these illegals and their families coming to the US.
yah dats true
Those same 30% who support Trump?
Does citizenship even have any meaning anymore?
Reid is the worst bigot and racist on cable news.
In my opinion, only an inhumane person would not want to see others, no matter who they are or where they come from succeed.
so, in classic trump style, expect it to be canceled.
Majority should rule dreamer's stay
RETWEET THEIR PARENTS BACK
How can I agree or disagree with a poll
I would like to see reparations legislation created and advanced more than ANYTHING DACA, but sure I agree.
Of course we all know that @realDonaldTrump supports the 30%.
LOL you took this poll in a bodega.
According to the same pollsters who somehow managed to miss the Trump wave.  #LiberalsNeverLearn
Retweet to agree with the statistic?
Hahhahahhahahah MSNBC poll - was it conducted in Spanish ?

. My am would have joy if Reid was given the job she's qualified 4........flipping burgers and cleaning grease traps.
Because the left wing nazi propaganda machine isn't telling the truth about DACA! Harms the black communities the most!
Bull shit poll! Sampling:
36% Real American Patriots
64% illegals
#DACA is unconstitutional. And we don't believe liberal polls. Nice try Joy.
Hell YASSSSSSSSSSSS!
seems wrong we have a government who is catering to 30% of the people's desires instead 64%--& it makes a real case 4 fraud in the election
I have mixed feelings,I get up from my five bedrooms and go to black low income hoods and can't with honesty square it.All folks have needs
Why folks bring up the AA employment rate is beyond me. Don't use us as an excuse to be against DACA.
MSM does another "unbiased" poll like the one they did for 2016 election. Wrong again can't poll just 1 side

And most likely about 60% of those combined people surveyed have no idea what DACA is
I like how people forget how ACA was approved. If they wanted DACA they would have passed legislation. That makes Democratic Party racist
no they don't. At least  50% (Democrats) have no idea what it actually does to America thanks to the B.S. you spread. #shameonyou
Courts to reward criminal behavior. Lady justice is blind. It will open the flood gates. The parents knew the risk and still came. 
85% were against Trumpcare and it still almost passed, relying on the kindness of Republicans is naive.
Can't trust polls. Need to know demographic and region.
No, we don't. Who did you poll? Only ILLEGALS? Only DemoKKKrats who stand alongside criminal Illegals over our own homeless? Disgusting.
@anneowenphd Will this help Trump to make the decision
This poll is as real as the actions polls. Keep believing FAKE NEWS Chanells LIBTARD
The 25/30% base is quite solid. Nothing will change their mind, even innocent kids. Scary..
Sadly....but true
Trump needs a dog muzzle. Constant disgrace with his remarks.
And 75% of Americans oppose Trump ! @amjoyshow

Only a trump item would not
30% base of racist trolls
@amjoyshow is this the same poll that predicted HRC would win in 2016?
I don't think AMERICA should screen our immigrants based on whether they will achieve a PhD or a GED. These are PEOPLE, not worker bees.
That's trumps 30%, no matter what he does, they're behind him wearing his asinine maga hats
538's forecasting was much closer and within margin of error. https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/ …
That 30 percent..who are they? What do they stand for?
You would have to be so out of touch not to realize that these kids are not "from" Mexico. THIS is their home country. Don't banish them!
#DACA vital!!! These "Dreamers" only know 1 country, USA!!! 

#resist #VoteThemOut #BLM 
#TurnTXBlue #DACA
#BetOnBeto #LoseCruz 
I totally agree  pls keep DACA.. Thks Joy for speaking out.. This is who we are Mr. POTUS
LIES
@POTUS cuts the nose of the Nation despite the face. Trump shows true face to please the mean spirited base.Wrong move Mr President. #resist
What about the DACA members of the military's.
This is a LIE. Another fake poll.
here is the problem. Poles don't change the constitution. Rule of law. Change the constitution. There is a process for that.
Funny, I didn't get that question 
Can someone look into this? Where is Trump going to send these people? He can't make countries take them back. Is he going to jail them?
This is a scary thought.
That 30% seems familiar somehow.
This does not matter to Trump. Him&Bannon have a Hate plan & they're sticking to it if Putin can keep Trump in office long enough. P pissed.
@KAdnoub Only the cruel hearted could want DACA overturned! Those kids here thru no fault of their own! They will be 4 America
2.1% of your followers agree and have retweeted.
Support!
"If it ain't broke, Don't try to fix it"
@realDonaldTrump would be a moron if change the #dada policy. Scary part is that @POTUS didn’t really show #sanity as #president
the Families should stay together - after they all move back to Mexico
This Obama's program needs to stop  enough is enough
64% of all americans???
SEND THEM ALL BACK--they BROKE U.S. LAW--AMERICA FIRST--OUR CHILDREN COME FIRST--they can go dream in their own nations that they came from
I support #DACA.
3805 retweeted, do know what a small percentage of America that is? I don't even think it registers! Get a life libtard!
I support #DACA
Agree
64% of the 100 people who watch MSNBC? Impressive.
Doesn't matter how many support it, it is unconstitutional. Article 1, Section 8. Arcticle 2, Section 3 read it, Joy, and get back to me.
Another leftist Fake Poll
Thx u joy for pounding out the facts n giving the dreamers a voice which raises our collective intelligence about dreamer contibutions
Right. That was 74% yesterday.
Now you say 64% with no proof of either.
I bet 64% don't even know what you are talking about.
#DACA
@BBBlocksberg that's an @MSNBC poll. Shoot not worth anything
I feel like the phrasing is as bad as it can be. "The DACA policy" can mean supporting DACA, or supporting Trump's plan.
Continue to be disheartened by the fact that 30% of the nation is soulless and stupid. If it was 15%, I'd say OK. But 30...? Come on, people
If our vengeful POTUS try's to overturn DACA it will be a another stain in his short and shameful presidency. We are better than this
Awe you are so caring! Your opinion means nothing!
Bot
Total bot
There is No black middle class, I'm in the 36%

@amjoyshow #DACA #EndDACA #Resist #BLM @NAACP #povery #inequality
Joy, thanks for an informative segment today. I had no idea Dreamers had to pay $500 every 2 yrs to keep their status, and other details.
I support DACA!!
the same pole used to say Hillary would win election  LMAO!!
The only reason Trump is opposed to DACA is because Obama started it
Couldn't agree with you less, he has demonstrates it by going after all Obama's achievements. The only thing he is tired of fowl is the ACA
From an NBC survey monkey lol
The same 34% that still loves Trump
@NotAcquiescing very interesting...that's almost the same as trump's approval number...  Coincidence ?? Hummm...
