Government grants made up 3% of Meal on Wheels revenues, or $248K in 2015.

So, that's 12 yrs of #MOW funding for every Trump trip. #Budget
The WH: Cutting Meals on Wheels is 'compassionate' b/c they can't ask a 'coal miner' to pay.

Would 'coal miners' rather pay for golf trips?
No problem. @Pappiness the First Lady has come up with an alternative Meals on Wheels. Let them eat my jewelry. 
Nobody cared when the Obama's took separate planes to CA the same day. Or Pelosi flying in private jet every weekend.
Obama didn't spend in a YEAR what this clown spends every week GORGING HIMSELF.
Within 2 months Trump had already spent 1 year of Obama's travel expenses At this rate 1 year of Trump's expenses will = 6 years of Obama's.
Lol.. who cares? What about all of Michelles vacations?
"What about"?  Trump is on office now so it's  what about him & he is spending 6 years worth of ALL of Obama's expenses including Michelle.
Most American's care when he's cutting childcare for Military families, & meals for elderly & disabled PBS & the coast guard & healthcare
@esmepmarm he could skip 1 trip n feed thousands of his supporters for a year. That'd be an easy choice for any other human.
People who volunteer for MOW also volunteer to drive the eldery and disabled on errands to the doc, to vote, etc.
It makes me sick.
Democrats, please just once,  break rules to impeach
Another example of #GOP #FiscalResponsibility, when it comes to their party being in office...
It's not just indefensible, it's criminal. It's beyond unjust enrichment. It's blatant corruption.
@owenbernard And they call themselves Christians, as they kill all programs that aid the poor! Pathetic and evil.
@nhdogmom ,
Crooked GOP repuks defend it saying it is ok what the BLOTUS  does on his weekends off!  remember Hypocrisy when Obama vacation
'APPLES' vs 'Agent ORANGE'
.@Pappiness @realDonaldTrump: 'Hmm, wonder if I should have the peppercorn sauce on my steak? A bucket of KFC later during Hannity..'
So called Christians What Would Jesus Do?? You Better Read The Bible and The Constitution!! We Are Coming #TheResistance
@LilSheBeast Since Trump says he won't take a salary, why should we foot the bill for what is essentially private travel on AF1?
He's taking a salary
Pamela, I know he is.  I'm just trying to point that out.
Well get out Ur Calculator 
POTUS45 On a Military BUYING Spree!!

Say Good Bye BUDGET!!
NEW Records 2 B Made!!!
CALL EMAIL CONGRESS,  HIT STREETS TOMORROW SUNDAY WITH EVERYONE U KNOW THEY KNOW MAKE REAL REVOLUTION PROTEST AGAINST ALL
@MiaFarrow Who can stop the madness
Melanie avoiding Trump in New York for a mere six days, three million dollars.
@moon15116 what do you expect from a pee lover
So why doesn't one of your Trump-hating Nazi-collaborating liberal billionaires finance that instead of riots? @Pappiness @MvonNordeck
@ms73 Remember when Hitler ordered adult euthanasia? This is the slow version of the same ideal. http://ww2history.com/key_moments/Holocaust/Hitler_authorizes_killing_of_disabled …
.@Pappiness @JonJusth  Any #MAGA #tcot Trump supporter out there who is also a #MealsonWheels recipient? This ok with you?
perfectly defensible! After all there is no evidence that the program is making people younger! #kleptocracy
@GreatDismal This is for Donnie T

From a draft dodger Trump and his sons who will never serve our country
Everything is defensible when you try hard enough...
@gregpak Has any journalist asked Trump about his weekly trips & the hypocrisy of him criticizing Obama for travelling far less?
http://www.mealsonwheelsamerica.org/docs/default-source/financials/meals-on-wheels-america-audited-financial-statements-2015.pdf?sfvrsn=2 …
This pig is destroying our great country.
My mom was a Meals on Wheels recipient the last 2 years of her life. Unbelievable.
1 year of meals on wheels pays for only 1 day of a senior in hospital & two thirds of all hospital beds are taken up by seniors
you do realize the total fed MOW budget is over $200 mill, of course
@KellyLoyGilbert The big orange baby does not care, as long as his impeccable Russian-spies-waiters bring him his overdone steak.
had better stick with comedy since facts are not your strength...
Here's answer from M-O-W."Government funding for Meals on Wheels, accounted for 3 percent of its $7.5 million in 2015"
What percentage of its budget does M-O-W get from the Federal government?
This figure is way off. Please go to the Meals on Wheels Twitter page.
@eyemlala 
Trump's ass being in OUR WHITE HOUSE IS INDEFENSIBLE! IF thishead wasn't in the WH, we'd NEVER be having discussions

And the budget from the government is actually 325,000.  #fakenews.
You weren't worried about the hungry while you pissed away trillions on the global warming ponzi scheme.
@AndyRichter a true Johnathan Swift moment
good thing he isn't taking that presidential salary though. That would just be greedy. Lol
It's OBSCENE!!
One of them funnels money directly into his and his kids' pockets. One of them is the least a civilization can do.
@AndyRichter enough is enough #impeach
While that is bad, imagine how many meals that 1.7 billion we gave to Iran would buy. Both parties suck.
Sadly, no amount of complaining on Twitter has changed anything at this point.
@KatherineConkl4 As a nurse, this is absolutely sickening, and very sad.
It's all about priorities. Trump never wanted to be President for the people, he wanted to be popular and richer.
And Obama did the same thing.. 
ALSO...
ONE day 4
@MELANIATRUMP
&The Lil' Prince = 3mm.
As is his golf outings.
I SORTA remember
@POTUS44 golf being
an 'issue'
@Pappiness
It's the budget created by sociopaths.
@kanthom2000
@RedAnneBolynn Out of their mouth, they must CURSE TRUMP!!
hell, one single jet funds lunch programs for years with a military that's already larger than all foes combined
@VictoriaAveyard
@VictoriaAveyard not the government job to feed you.
Trump is a pig! Just a god-awful pig!!
Don The Con! Make him and his homies richer at the expense of the less fortunate (including Mother Earth)! #DontheCon
why the outrage?His logic->everyone dies. No food=fast track.No burden on trumpcare either. Keep tax payers only, the useful ones
Indefensible. Unconscionable. Unacceptable. Appalling. Inhuman. Horrifying. I swear I am running out of words for this horrorshow
I'm so disgusted by this move! build a wall? how about you take care of people who you said you would?
How in the world do people defend not feeding the elderly? How? I  am seriously asking? How?
@PressSec @KellyannePolls @jasoninthehouse @TeamCavuto @larry_kudlow @SteveRattner old folks don't need food, Trump needs golf.
@johnpmcneil02 oh it will be justified not defended.  Shameless @GOP.
@tavlesh it really is. Mulvaney said it wasn't working so they're cutting it. Just like after school programs. They're bastards
But Mulvaney is just this aft'noon defending it. GOP moral compass has been pulled out, stomped on, run over, pissed on.
What moral compass?
Tough but fair question.
Said Marx.
@kparnell56 @realDonaldTrump
@SnarkAmendment LET'S TALK ABOUT #MELANIA NESTING AT #TRUMPtowers=AGAIN ON THE #TAXPAYERS TAB!!
@genevab123 This fake president has no soul.
mind boggling. Trump has no clue how 99% live.
Is that figure right? $3m/year for MOW would maybe cover one or two states, hardly the entire country.
That is only $ of Fed Funds they receive. States add state funds, donations, volunteers not paid.
and ge will make money off his salary at the end of the year, enough to fund Meals for 6 months. Instead he'll prosper off us.
Oh, they'll defend it. They'll defend every reprehensible thing he does.
Lets hope this budget is DOA which I believe it will probably be.
So much for that campaign rhetoric of taking care of our own first, especially vets. All talk, zero action by Trump.
@EarlNash Guarding Melania in Trump Tower, $30 million per month.
What's your source for these numbers? This is going to be retweeted thousands of times, and nobody knows if it's true.
Trump priorities. 
@robsaxan @realDonaldTrump proves after 70 yrs of taking advantage of working class & raiding his "charity" he isn't changing
I was wondering what the mar-a-lago:meals on wheels ratio was. Sickening.
@ZackFord this really bothers me a lot.  This program did more than feed the home bound, my mom has them, and donates to them.

4 Years - $1.296 Billion

8 Years - $2.592 Billion…
Trump is  disgrace from top to bottom and all ways in between. How much does it cost to feed ppl who can't get out?
@lindafader he said people won't die on the streets, they will starve to death quietly at home
@themis96 I'm beyond angry at this!  My blood pressure went way up.  That cretin will let Americans starve while he plays golf
@AtticusinCanada
@Mainekindxl So @GOP, are you enjoying throwing taxpayer $ at the spoiled rich guy while hurting Americans? We WON'T FORGET. 
@PersuasivePR his backers are hypocrites. So much for human lives & family values
Exactly!!!
only thing that tells me is meals on wheels is gonna be cut. #trumpdontcare
disgusting animal he is. Still can't phathom how anyone voted for him
@JenniferNail3 completely 45 doesn't care about anyone but self and his agenda.
and cruel #trumpbudget #TrumpTaxReturns  #StopPresidentBanyon
