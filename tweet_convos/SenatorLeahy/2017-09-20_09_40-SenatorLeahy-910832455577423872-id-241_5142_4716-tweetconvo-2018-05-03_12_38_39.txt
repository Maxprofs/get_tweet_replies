Must be a good bill, if the greedy insurance companies aren't getting paid off!
You must really hate a large portion of Americans to be happy they will lose access to affordable healthcare.
650 a month is not affordable... Obamacare is a straght rape of the middle class....oh and don't kid yourself it's now catastrophe insurance
But this new plan will NOT be better! Need to force congress to stand up to insurance companies and drug co's and give us what we need!
Look I agree but don't like the word give....put caps on pricing....and make more compitition to drive cost down....
Even the evil insurance companies are calling Trumpcare evil.
All about the $$$$$
Insurersincentiv2costsbenefit 4consumrs as long as$ w/aca! RepealACA-then require FreeMkt Refrms! @freedomcaucus @realDonaldTrump
Thinning out the population so there’s more for them. Greedy bastards
And that'sTrump's version of making America great again folks it's simple f*** the people Help the rich,f*** other countries to help himself
The GOP & @realDonaldTrump continue to lie, obfuscate & deceive re: ACA repeal. They care more about dissing Obama then helping Americans.
Trump has spent his entire time in office competing with the man he will never measure up to.
#GrahamCassidy is horrible and @GOP own it-@SenDeanHeller @SenRonJohnson @BillCassidy @LindseyGrahamSC We won't forget this!!
Please also tell that #BlueCross and others have quadrupled their profits in past 5 years. Thanks to #Obamacare. We pay 150% more. Soon 200%
When insurance companies appear to be more humane than you, you don't belong on public office. @GOP
I had an individual  policy with them 10 yrs. They went from $159/mo to $1200/mo BECAUSE OF OBAMACARE. I'll be GLAD when o'care is history.
So can we agree Cassidy is a bold faced liar???
From a Canadian and so true.
Hey Val- please tell this Canadian that the people pushing this bill are ONLY doing it to cut taxes for the rich per Koch Bros instructions
Country is in real trouble until this elder generation of rich bastards die off. Sadly they will end up killing a lot of us off b4 they go.
And the 'mass genocide' of the poor & lower middle class will be their legacy.
Blue Cross is the 7th biggest lobbyist in DC https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/top.php?indexType=s … #Swamp #Cartel
Exactly. There's your answer
Then you clearly don't understand the question.
Can someone tell Senator Cassidy? #CassidyGraham
He. Does. Not. Care. He's more afraid of @gop donors like Koch withholding campaign funds and losing his Senate seat.

@FoxNews If you don't like @JimmyKimmelLive assessment, why not consider Blue Cross  and comments from 50 Medicaid directors.
Someone tell .@JeffFlake @indivisiblephx
Please pay attention @SenJohnMcCain @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins NO ONE wants #GrahamCassidy
Congress owns stock in that company if they don't like it it must be better for us! When they call foul don't look for a chicken?
Truth will out!!! VOTE NO
Need CBO REPORT before actual costs known. We don't know all facts as it would be different state by state!!!
READ THE DAMN BILL! IT DEFRANCHISES THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
Americans affected by blocking
Millions and
Huge job loss for healthcare workers...
All they care about is passing SOMETHING before Sept 30, when they will need 60 votes to pass instead of 50. That's it!!! We are pawns!!
Blue Cross could just not be an asshole. No one is forcing them to preclude preexisting conditions.
And no one would just force them to increase premiums for those conditions either
But they would.......

Cassidy and Graham say big deal, what do health insurance companies know about health insurance?  They should stay in their lane. #resist
Since both parties are suppose to represent #America why don't you both stop working against each other & work for us? Do your job!
@SenJohnMcCain @SenatorCollins     Please read.
So trump lied? Shocker!
@LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy the irony Insurance industry is saying it is bad when possibly they could make $$ makes you look heartless
Right on top of things, aren't you? What else is new about @GOP disregard for Americans' well being?
Read between the lines it impacts their rebate money.
I would like to pick my own health care. Not Hitler care  (Obama care )this is the USA not Russia or N Korea Why doI have to pay for it.
@SpeakerRyan lives off Taxpayers $280,000 Salary/Top Healthcare

 Never available for constituents.

Vote in @IronStache Randy Bryce!
Did you know that if you are a BCBS policy holder, you are also a shareholder? Just got proxy in the mail. Exercise your vote!
Thank you Blue Cross for being honest.
@GOP @LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy the 2018 elections are just around the corner. We will not forget those who voted for #deathcare. Ur out.
@SenJohnHoeven - even your friends at BC know this is a bad bill! If NO outside organization endorses this nonsense, how can you?!? Vote NO.
#Resist
Let's make Congress care the only way they understand:
@LindseyGrahamSC You have two choices. https://tinyurl.com/yasd3ofz  Please share with any American who has the inalienable right to life.
Do the authors know this or just pretend not to know?
Folks keep making calls!
GOP is lying 

We don't have preexisting cost control now as it is
They may not be paid and obviously uninformed!!!
I'd like to see the #CBO score of the great financial benefit to #smallbusinesses with healthcare for all
Which amazing seeing how Blue Cross sucks
.@TheOklahoman .@tulsaworld Please ask @JimInhofe and @SenatorLankford to explain their support of #GrahamCassidy given this problem.
Oh those Republicans with all the double talk! Lets see what is it they say.. oh yes.. campaign promises over doing the right thing!
@SenateGOP The insurance companies keep explaining this 2 U We keep explaining it 2 U Med groups keep explaining it 2 U Why won't you listen
"the block grants it would create could be too small" LOL that is the POINT of "block grants" pay less than true costs & call it "freedom"
Admit it @BillCassidy @LindseyGrahamSC @SenDeanHeller --your terrible plan will destroy the ACA's pre-existing condition protections.
WOW so @LindseyGrahamSC LIED.

Not surprised by that since almost everyone in the @GOP Lies to protect Trump even at the RHC Convention.
Does Cassidy really think he'll be re-elected if he pushes this bill through, even with Koch brother money? #OutOfTouch
He worried about losing seat I don't think is going to help and he should lose his seat. This is shameful
The will own Trump care when this affects people and the economy
@realDonaldTrump @senrobportman @LindseyGrahamSC   Because you have no idea what is in your bill. This is idiot proof.
Would someone clue in that dimwit Graham???
@LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy I just wanted to pass this on to you from real medical professionals who actually care about people.
Because ultimately they insurers know that they bear the cost when it catapults single-payer into motion. #GrahamCassidyBill
Of course it does. Cassidy-Graham knows this. They don't care! They just want to repeal Obamacare care mo matter the consequences. Sad.
The @GOP are proven liars...risking millions of lives for political gain.  Not one major health organization supports this TrumpCare plan
@SenBobCorker @SenAlexander Vote No. This bill hurts many in TN. A bipartisan bill is the way to reform ACA. #TNVoter #votedForBothofYou
The @GOP are lying about this bill.
Those fucking liars.
.@GOP @BillCassidy so Jimmy Kimmel is right - you LIED TO HIS FACE and still deny it! #lyinGOP #NoRepeal #SaveACA
Insurance companies should b worried, cause no1 will be buying at these rates, life or death cant make ppl pay what they dont have
Exactly, ACA good for most insurance companies.
.@GOP @LindseyGrahamSC Wow - you denied this last night on TV - #LyinGOP is at it again. #NoRepeal #SaveACA #GetGOPOut #SackLindseyGraham
@LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy you don't seem to understand your own bill...what a inept way to lead, your ignorance will kill people
Tell that to Trump
And this from a company that might profit from dropping/increasing costs for people with PEC. Even they cannot stay silent about this bill.
I know many who were duped by ACA.  Quit acting like it’s a perfect plan.
@GOP @SenateGOP @BillCassidy @LindseyGrahamSC  We do know what you're up to, so no more lies please.  Give us some credit.
Even insurance companies are against this “bill”
Thank you #bluecross.
@realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @SenJohnMcCain @SenCapito Be brave Senators.
Your leadership is willing to throw you under the bus to get donor money. Don't let Americans die so Mitch and Ryan get a check.
@LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy this from people who would profit from your bill, so have no reason to lie, very telling!
It must be bad if a health insurer is warning against it.
@LindseyGrahamSC  what say you? More lies?
Does the GOP read their bills before signing?
Hey @LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy - when do you plan on telling the truth? How many million Americans have to suffer first?
Republicans offer no care. You will not have care. With Obamas affordable care, as is put by Obama, state's cannot decide u must pay more.

I have lived in the U.K. And NYC for 20 years now back in #canada objectively our healthcare rocks! Nothing I can't get done efficiently.
Terrifying and anybody who thinks this won't negatively affect them is in for a seriously rude awakening! #healthcarebill
Trump&gop will lie,cheat&steal2end insurance4 every1but themselves.screw elderly,vets,disabled&poor ppl,gop believes poor ppl R expendable!!
@SenSasse @SenFischer_GSPP When AMA and your insurance co. say it's bad, you should vote NO!
JUST IN: Blue Cross: GOP's ObamaCare repeal bill "undermines" protections for pre-existing conditions
@LindseyGrahamSC Have you noticed Blue Cross's take on your bill?
Did @SenJohnMcCain wager our health care in a game of political craps to increase military $? Talk about an #entitlement. #dotherightthing
BC doesn't say they're sending out letters taking healthcare away from us.  I got one of those letters. No single payer. so ends Dec 31.
Don't let this pass @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP!
Have you seen how much Trumpcare sucks yet @realDonaldTrump ???
@JuddApatow The @SenateGOP #trumpcare2 denies maternity care as essential benefit & cuts #PlannedParenthood funds. Medical groups oppose.
@lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @SenJohnMcCain FYI
@realDonaldTrump lied again, what a a surprise...
Hey @SenCoryGardner here's more food for thought, cc @CardboardCoryCO
JUST IN: Blue Cross: GOP's ObamaCare repeal bill "undermines" protections for pre-existing conditions http://hill.cm/itZalcK  
Call you Reps stay in this together we can end it once again!
@realDonaldTrump Perhaps you should believe the insurers.
We know. We're not stupid
So what's bigger, the insurance lobby or the Koch's $400 million? We'll soon find out.
Koch upped it to $1bn. Can you match that for a NO vote?. I guess not.
Will Blue Cross be participating in  all the exchanges regardless of profitability?
So who actually wants this legislation?

Does he know what's in his own bill!?
Who should I believe?  The people on the deck plates or the LIARS on the 0-10 level who can't past their own Jimmy Kimmel test!
Still say it's garbage to say this @LindseyGrahamSC ?
Here's an idea BCBS, you don't have to follow the GOPs plan.
Thank you Blue Cross for looking out for us!
Thanks BCBS...now I'm glad u r my insurer.
Men elected with fewer voters due to Gerrymandering, Electoral College, and Rep Caps are deciding this.
@SenCapito @lisamurkowski @SenJohnMcCain @SenatorCollins Truth from those who know. #VoteNOGrahamCassidy #KillTheBill
Do you care about anyone other than yourself? Like people who have little money and buy cheap, GMO food?
If you're a concerned citizen, what is Monsanto doing in the FDA?
Why is Monsanto in the FDA? People with less money than those with huge ability to buy insurance eat cheap food full of Monsanto Glyphosate.
The #GrahamCassidy bill is simply cruel. @votevets @AARPadvocates @actblue #SaveACA @SenJohnMcCain @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @JeffFlake
@realDonaldTrump you should read  or get someone to explain it to you since you don't understand it does affect  pre existing conditions.
ARE YOU LISTENING WYOMING + DT VOTERS ?
That's YOU too.
Sen Cassidy, you are a liar @jimmykimmel
Yes, Just Read the Bill
P. 13 States may waive "ANY provision that restricts the criteria used to vary premiums".
Basically a free-for-all
@SenToomey care to comment?
How do you explain this  @BillCassidy
@realDonaldTrump fyi, in case u missed it
Pretty frightening when the insurance industry is being more honest than elected officials like @BillCassidy & @GrahamBlog.Very telling!
.Great point!
Before we get too excited lets review how 'honest" Follow the $ - it may hurt their bottom line. Is that why they're not explicitly against?
I was being a little facetious but you get my point.
Well, their bottom line depends on their customers not being dead, so yeah...
Good article on how #GrahamCassidy—in practical terms—doesn't protect pre-existing cond. "Affordable" isn't defined.
https://twitter.com/MarkWarner/status/910514039909965830 …
Desperate to appease Trump & eff over American people. GOP continues 2 pick party over people regardless of consequences. Sneaky agenda
Well that's something. Still moderately terrified, of course. But it's something.
Hey @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy you are lying to us about you health care plan according to blue cross & blue shield We
demand Medicare for all. You can take your plan & stick up your ass. We will revolt at the polls in 2018
Hear this, @LindseyGrahamSC, you are full of it! Stop lying to the American people to give tax breaks to the Kochs! #GrahamCassidy
@msnbc @ap @variety REPEAL will STEAL pre existing conditions BAN & we'll NEVER get it back. SAVAGE blow to SENIORS, the POOR, MIDDLE class
@cnn @aarp @naacp @dnc @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats GOP intolerable LIARS saying ANYTHING to RAM down America's throat. Our KIDS will SUFFER

@SenJohnMcCain  Another nail in #GrahamCassidy Bill. No CBO, no regular order please don't vote for this.
Of course it does.
You think the GOP gives a shit? They're flatout determined to get that Koch money come hell or high water. Even if means that millions die.
Because fuck the GOP. and fuck everything.
It undermines #BlueCross's profits. #Obamacare
@BillCassidy @LindseyGrahamSC You are liars!!!!
Excellent

Dear #MAGA supporters: Who do you believe?
Who doesn't have a pre-existing condition these days? The #GrahamCassidy bill is a death sentence for them.  All Senators should vote NO 
@LindseyGrahamSC when even the insurance cos start telling you how bad your bill is, you ought to listen and start making changes.
Thank you Blue Cross. I buy my health insurance from you directly thanks to Obamacare's pre-existing conditions protections.
Hmm.  If its so bad I wonder if Blue Cross wouldn't race to the bottom to charge more for worse coverage?  Doubtful.
One must assume the reason behind BCBS's "concern" is r/t their financial interests because they spend BICG bucks lobbying
Of course Blue Cross doesn't want to provide medical care for pre-existing conditions: that's majority of the costs they pay out for!
Under ACA, already do! This law would allow them to opt out of that, and yet they still oppose it!  Pay Attention!!
This is all the evidence you need. BC/BS insures one in three Americans.
Hey @BillCassidy this bill is terrible. You know it. We know it. THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWS IT!!!
So gullible... now you trust insurance companies? Pick a side.
.@RepSteveScalise- BlueCross says GOP bill undermines pre-existing conditions. Stop lying about ObamaCare. NO -->> #GrahamCassidy
@SenCoryGardner what's your stance on prexisting conditions?  Blue cross says Graham-Cassidy undermines coverage.
Blue Cross' condition for covering preexisting conditions is govt subsidizing their bottom line. @thehill
JUST IN: Blue Cross: GOP's ObamaCare repeal bill "undermines" protections for pre-existing conditions http://hill.cm/itZalcK  
@SenCapito listen to the people who know about these things!
Thank you Blue Cross (no griping when I pay my premiums next month!).  No #GrahamCassidy
Me too!  Good for my BCBS!  And I love Starbucks too!
This is directly related to the Koch brothers foundation & the Mercers. They are pushing for repeal and tax reform.
The campaign finance laws give too much power to the donors.
So true
Will the nation's so-called nonprofit Blues spend down any of their massive cash reserves?

Likely
Not likely 

Once you're born , you start your pre-existing conditions. Health Insurance companies just want premiums and subsidizes with no payouts.
So the government has to make you cover preexisting conditions, Blue Cross? Just do it, Blue Cross! @thehill
JUST IN: Blue Cross: GOP's ObamaCare repeal bill "undermines" protections for pre-existing conditions http://hill.cm/itZalcK  
Free market forces don't work well with insurance.  Americans want cheap. Fedetal govt must force morality on for-profit industry.
That's a fine pt to debate but not my point.  No one is skeptical of  Blue Cross here? @IdahoRoadapple @thehill
Agree. When big biz is FOR something, I question its value to the common people. Some issues are so complex you just have to follow the .
Healthcare orgs, insurance cos, patients, doctors all oppose #GrahamCassidy. @SenateGOP @lisamurkowski @SenJohnMcCain @SenatorCollins
Thank you, Blue Cross!
Little boy in the sandbox whose only desire is to throw sand in President Obama's face. Sad. You lose.
Everytime that we have to fight 4 the respect that we deserve as Americans, we only have to remember ONE thing!#Never4Get
Regardless we still have a healthcare problem no matter the bill in place
CASSIDY is a liar! Graham/Cassidy  is a con to get money so the TURTLE can craft Tax Reform or cuts.
Exactly!
.@LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy @SenateMajLdr  Proof it will be lower? You will have the same insurance from the state you live in?
.@gop is showing their deranged and evil need for political nonsense over people over anything else.
