How many shares of Rosneft did Gang of Trump get? @PeterAlexander
Report this week 19.5mill transferred to "unknown buyer", famous dossier suggested payoff of 19mill was DT reward
@godownthefield None of this will defeat Trump in 4 yrs.  DNC elects a chair this month.  Get involved.
More NYG tweets, less Trump hysteria
same, so exhausted keeping up with news anymore.
it's just so blatant and no one is stopping them
right! I never felt so powerless in my life.
would be worse if not for the millions of Americans fighting back!
stop being reactionary. Protest TAXES & RUSSIA
yes! offense is important. So is reacting to what happens
resistance isn't a zero sum game--we need all of the above!


US Treasury Dept should stop illegal alien scourge from sending US$ out of our country! That would be an outstanding idea!
My info says sanction change is to permit US firms to pay for licenses to use encryption in their offices
I don't understand - @PeterAlexander's report says it's to allow companies to do business with FSB.
Do you wear a parachute when you jump off the cliff or think you'll just bounce when you hit bottom..?? hahahaha
@deray this was proven fake
It's like Red Dawn without the Wolverines :(
Thanks again Trumpies you are again proven to be the stupidest people in the F'ing universe.  Enjoy Russia West
Next time someone asks "How did Hitler/Mussolini happen?" slap 'em clear into the middle of next year
Much respect given to the 1793 French citizens. #louisxvi #bannon and #bannonsbitches need a wake up call. "We" #resist
makes sense. That way we can sell them the tech they need to hack us.


@SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC time to pass sanctions legislation #RESISTANCE #WomensMarch
"Not a puppet."
@docrocktex26 @PeterAlexander The @GOP knows, look away nothing to see here. They're complicit in the Treason. Power grab.
It's #FakeNews from #FakeNewsMedia @nbc
The Russian Oligarchs Are Coming! 
The Russian Oligarchs Are Coming!
@deray
This is a "no big deal" - sanctions wording harmed both in sharing terror Intel.
Focus on easing Corp bribery rules.
If ANYBODY other than a sarcastic democrat says, "But Hillary's emails....." I'll knock their teeth out!
what a hard ass snowflake
Snowflakes aren't buying guns and hiding behind walls because they're scared of somebody's religion.
like Warren being told to sit down and stop talking about Sessions. When ever Trump breaks law sessions will let it slide
@SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC SANCTIONS LEGISLATION NOW! #TheResistance #Indivisible #WomensMarch #SanctionsLegislationNow
.@PeterAlexander More "fake news" just like @zekejmiller jumping the gun and claiming @potus removed bust of MLK. Shame. @nbcnews
I wish HRC would've warned us about Trump being a potential puppet regime.
she tried in the last debate
Don't they teach 'journalists' how to confirm their stories any longer? If not, then you need some real help with that. FAKE
@emmasophiabates #SanctionsLegislationNow #WomensMarchNeverEnds @LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain SANCTIONS LEGISLATION NOW
@deray It was more difficult to predict the sunrise.

One year later, *still* amazing to witness this part of American history...
I'd settle for what the CONSTITUTIONAL REMEDY is! #notmypresident #TRAITOR #illegitimate #LOSER #RESIST
well at least I RT the correction quickly.

What the hell is happening here!? We were sold to the highest bidder, Russia.

@SuzBrockmann welcome to new world order. For your safety remain seated & quiet while the ride is moving cue circus music
@EJLandwehr Seems like Trump ran 4 president just to undo everything Obama did to try & erase the existence of a blk pres.
in plain English pls?
And the coverup ends...the bros are chest bumping as we speak...not even gonna try to hide it..
where are all the so-called patriots in the Senate. Hey @SpeakerRyan are you complicit with this treason
Let's get all of our secrets and cyber intelligence over to @PutinRF_Eng nice of Trump
.@SenateMajLdr .@SpeakerRyan @GOP have become communist sympathizers instead of patriots. #UnAmerican!
@SoWithHer The q still remains, if it's such a small and minuscule chg. to sanctions, then why bother? It's FSB, technology!
@SoWithHer Why? IC will be all over this one no matter it thrills them to get close w/FSB & or they don't, and get close
Can they give us one VALID reason for this? Anything that justifies this?
@SpryGuy of course
God Russia owns America.
Greenwald and Snowden were unavailable for comment
Has their been evidence yet of how Rosneft plays into this?
Hey @SenJohnMcCain you going to speak up or what? You did TV 24/7 when Obama sneezed but Trump/Putin/Exxon? Dead silent!!!
what in the actual f.

do some proper due diligence before u open ur mouth and insert ur foot.
.@PeterAlexander   Sure!  Quick to jump on the bandwagon, fake news attacks your veracity. #LookBeforeYouLeap  #TalkiingPointsMuch ?
People can be so gullible. How do they not see how telling that is? "I like the way he shakes things up. He gets it done."
@realDonaldTrump make sure to make all your payments for this headhunter getting you your job
fake news!
The Coup is complete. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
Cybersecurity sales to Russia. God forbid that the FSB would get hacked.  They might a video someone doesn't want released.
think any of them are Trump companies?
#FakeNews
Republicans gave Wall Street and bankers a free get out of jail card now Trump doing the same for Russia pay back 4 the win
seems Russia is getting their pay off for hacking the election today!
damage done. Way to go @NBCNews
The need to cash the check for the pee pee tapes.

FSB got their agent at the top of Dpt. of State, in WH, this is just a start
5k worth of business in a calendar year and no sanctions existed at all until 2015. Hardly a pro Russian stance.
#TrumpPutinTreason
Putin commands Trump, Delivers....
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan

We are baring witness to the conspiracy of Russian influence in the 2016 election.
#TrumpPutin
TREASON!
more  #fakenews
absolutely shameful we're allowing #PutinPuppet to destroy our country

Guess that Rosneft deal got all squared away then, eh?
@Ivanroberson And the roll back of sanctions begins. Trumpski had unrecorded call with Putin.
hey look. A guy who doesn't actually understand the effect and implementation of the sanctions. 
This is a nightmare.

this is insane
this is what clown DJT is trying to distract us from. Nothing to see here! Just paying off the Russian mob for their "help".

@USb4russia less than a week after Donald speaks to Putin, not a coincidence
Republicans created a hate for Hillary just because of emails while praising a man that hasn't paid takes for years. 1/2
Bannon = evil genius. Game plan is to wear the resistance down. Dems aren't organized. There's no focused investigation.
@eyevanj75 The same ppl who hacked DNC... It's their reward.
Yeah, sure, there's no pee pee tape.  Uh huh.  Keep moving, nothing to see here...

impeach!!
.@PeterAlexander @POTUS needs a loan
Please @KatyTurNBC, find that secrect connection to #Putin on #Trump so we can #impeach him sooner, rather than later. 
@SenJohnMcCain CAN YOU DO ANYTHING SENATOR MCCAIN BESIDES COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS MADMAN??????
It was expected.
@fadumzz don't let the real facts get in the way
And again....... #FakeNews
I'm scrolling looking for trump supporter to defend this ish. Crickets
I'm a dem, trade atty & support sanctions. only so US corps could file import docs with FSB; business w/fsb still blocked.
We need to know which companies decide to do business with Russia, including Trump, so we can boycott them.
Trump is Spy

@PeterAlexander @alaskarebel
#ScrewUpTrump is a Spy
Putin killed 3 top FSB agents
For leaking Blackmail Story 
Can't work with Cuba, but Russia?   Sure.  This is all going to backfire in GOP, but we are going to pay, maybe with lives.
Making Exxon and Russia Great again #maga thanks bible belt!
@SenatorLeahy What sort of transactions?
@DerenicByrd
@arawis Why don't they just take NSA and transfer it to the Kremlin? ?? the pretense? @SenJohnMcCain doesn't seem to care.
These were the sanctions Obama imposed the last week in office. It's called a set up just so idiots can scream when lifted
Double Speak. Can't Spin Benefitting Russia. They Profit = Sanctions Eased.
not good
@OurPowderDry
@SenatorLeahy I wonder why US is allowing this?
.@PeterAlexander Why is incorrect information still active when you have corrected it with a new tweet? 
Is it fun to perpetuate #fakenews ?
@PattyMurray @SenSchumer Please investigate #RussiaGate as soon as possible.
To sell encryption tech. WIN!
& we will never know the motive really is.
#fakenews way to go #journalismisdead You have no right to pretend to be part of my profession
Why didn't Hillary tell us tRump was a Putin puppet? Oh, she did.
#ShitShow every day it's a new one! #trump is out of his manic mind  #TrumpBan   @PeterAlexander
this is the reward to Russia for trump
"its spreading much more quickly than we had estimated... how do we contain this?"
What in the actual fuck?!
How is anyone surprised?
@louisabojesen You just conveniently forgot to mention that it was in the works before Trump took office.
@azamsahmed seems like a reasonable thing to prioritize 13 days into a presidency.
What a shock.  Who coulda guessed that these folk might start doing favors for Putin?
@SabrinaSiddiqui I can't keep on saying that I can't believe it
This happening as Russian backed rebels reign the shooting war in Ukraine.  Who's side are we on?
what companies Trump companies Traitor
This is criminal.
Nope, part of the plan. #Trumprussia
questions: why are any companies doing business with another nations hostile intelligence agency?


Russian puppet!!  Russian puppet!!
That's good, the majority of the sanctions issued by the Obama administration weren't fair.
Have they explained why?
At least the Trump administration is paying its debts.
we can resist all we want.  The rich and powerful, will never give up their power and control.
@CNN @maddow @JoyAnnReid @MSNBC  how can this not be the national lead story tonight???
Its fake news from Salon. nonsense. U people believe it
Quit your job.
The only deal of importance is the Exxon oil deal... Coincidence that ex ceo of Exxon was just sworn in?
So he eases sanctions then denies doing so?
Why don't you try to write this inaccurate tweet in a more inflammatory way?
They've jut put in a HUGE order for Trump steaks and vodka. #PresidentTraitor
@crookita Why shouldn't #NewMoscow be allowed to do business with the FSB?
Russia must have something on some republicans
oh wow, what a coincidence this happened JUST as soon as Tillerson was confirmed as Secretary of State 
I SMELL A RAT! A BIG FAT ORANGE RAT!
how you reward the man that got you elected. Orange clown  living in the White House is a traitor #ImpeachtRUMPutin
when I was little I'd have nightmares & my mom would give me a spoon full of sugar to have sweet dreams instead. Got sugar?
REVOLT AND RESIST take down the GOP and president if there is no impeachment regarding this
Trump's owned by Russia.
what more do we need to see before the press start calling for Trump's impeachment
@pirateannie16 Trump has to pay back Putin for helping him win election.
That's why he put Tillerson in. He has big contracts with Putin. That's what Tillerson is all about.
Every person complaining needs to call Graham, Rubio, McCain and scream bloody murder.
#Trump a puppet for lifting a futile sanction while #Hillary is the brave one for selling #Uranium to Russia. #Narrative
Everything's coming up Milhouse for Russia these days.

Can someone offer what they think is a "good" explanation for this?  Other than the obvious, of course.
This is false, I believe Peter already tweeted a correction
I believe this is the lastest post. If u believe its incorrect can u provide a link 4 me 2 read?
NEW: Russia's fmr FSB head calls US sanctions change "the first step." http://tass.com/politics/928745  

Compare the number of retweets/likes 
hhhhmmm, Ill get back, Im a little confuse: 1 tweet is = war on terror the other = cyber security. I need more info...
Don't we all :(
wouldn't it be easier to follow putin or kgb on twitter to see what trump is going to say next?
"Puppet, no puppet"
@bannerite Gee, that was quick (sarcasm).
Donald Trump is a traitor to the United States, and his regime are accomplices.
brilliant! Finally all those shares I had in the KGB can be realised... wait what? 
and so the Trump-Putin grand bargain begins ...

How Can #Republicans support this?!
EVERYONE needs to CALL and QUESTION their elected officials ON THIS???
@Honey17011 cause there is money for the dictator an some of his secretaries
why in a hurry?
FAKE NEWS. This was a technical fix, begun by OBAMA. Please retract.
Of course they are. SMDH
Did you speak to any other Senators about this?
NO!!! no no no no no!
Guess it's time to start practicing my Russian. #TrumpRussia #russianhacking
there is no place in our America for tyrants and treason.  We must demand an investigation into the Trump administrations...
dealings with Russia as a whole.  I think this is corrupt from the top down in the WH!  #ImpeachTrump
That didn't take long. Best day of Tillersons life.
what does this mean please
