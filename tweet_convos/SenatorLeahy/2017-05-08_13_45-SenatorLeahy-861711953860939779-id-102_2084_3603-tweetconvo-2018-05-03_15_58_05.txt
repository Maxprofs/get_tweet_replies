This seems like a good time to remind everyone Sessions was accused of perjury re: what he said about Russia in his confirmation hearings.
.@SenatorLeahy also said first year law students could recognize Trump's travel ban is unconstitutional. Safe to say #SallyYates agrees.
#SallyYates said enforcing travel been "would've been a betrayal of my solemn obligation to represent the people‚Äù
Yates forgets Aliens are NOT citizens. Obuma used very same Ban in 2011. No one stopped Obama banning Christians fleeing who is now isis.
Thank you for sharing! @cthagod put some sauce on it!
Sessions is as dirty as Flynn!
put this side by side with her latest hearing, shows how much "authoritarianism"  has infiltrated our government. @SallyQYates a patriot.
I couldn't stand the Beverly Hillbillies (sessions/granny) then and CERTAINLY can't 2 hear HIS VOICE NOW
poetic justice :-) how sweet it is
#SallyYates was too good for this administration.  She has ethics. She is simply amazing.

Jeff sessions is creepy
Yates for Pres!
I wonder if the current Attorney General agrees with the good senator @jeffsessions on role of AG in providing counsel to the president.
This is amazing!!!!!!!!!!
Not sure which is more ironic...this guy...or the guy leading the "lock her up" chant about to be ...locked up
Perfection! #gosally
I thought Justice Office of Council deemed order constitutional.  Prez entitled to day in court.
Has anyone noticed she did not look at notes during the hearing? This was all from memory. Not many people have that ability. #AmazingYates.

#NeverthelessShePersisted #YatesPatriot #AmericanHero
Isn't it refreshing someone thanked her for doing her job instead of being ripped apart or being fired.
Such a good point! If GOP wasn't COMPLICIT, they'd be thanking her, too. Their lack of concern about Russian interference speaks VOLUMES.
If Klan rallies had elves, they would look like Jeff Sessions.
OMG I literally laughed out loud 
Yates refused2obey  immigration laws. She decided it was unconstitutional yet aliensR Not citizens. O used SAME BAN N 2011 2 BAN CHRISTIANS
Wow. #SallyYates is one class act. She did exactly what she told Jeff Sessions she would do ... and GOT FIRED for having INTEGRITY.
He is a repulsive lizard.
Is it just me or does everyone say "Jefferson Beauregard Sessions" in their best Foghorn Leghorn voice?
That's how I hear it every time 
Unless I misheard, he also said AG Sessions has different standards than Sen. Sessions.
He did!  
That is ironic as hell. @SallyQYates was a credit to our government, and will be again.
Sessions IS A LIAR , A RACIST , A DANGEROUS PERSON , WITH LOTS OF POWER!,,,,,,     RESIST! STAY STRONG TOGETHER ! Vote
Integrity matters. #BeLikeSally
Now will he rise to his old standards? Doubt it
Let's just say, #sallyyates didn't lie under oath like #racist @jeffsessions did. Prob in bed with #russia too. Drip. Drip. Drip #maga
More quotes from #SCAGSessions.
It's ironic that Sally Yates is being questioned about her integrity by a man without any.
She did her job. Someone with morals.
Jeff Sessions, your credibility rating on a 1 to 10 is a -100,000,000 x nth power.
This is a daily dose of "Republicans are crooked".
Thanks!
Jess Sessions is one goofy looking elf.
He is dumber than he looks.
Haha! I believe you!
Fantastic job finding and posting this, John!  Thank you!
Btw, Sally was awesome today!!
Consistent
This clip only gets more surreal.
#SallyYatesIsAPatriot THE TRUTH IS STILL THE TRUTH.  THE CONSTITUTION IS STILL THE CONSTITUTION.  THANK YOU SALLY YATES! #TheResistance
She did her job, no doubt about it, and the country is better off because of it.
Brilliant!
What Sessions really meant is could you "say no" to a Democratic President?
She did exactly what @jeffsessions pressed her to do, but she did it to the white guy. #Doh
I lived in Alabama for 4 years (I'm recovered thanks) and that exactly what Beauregard Sessions is now pissed about. Sorry Al. that was low
I think I'm in love. Sally Yates
Me too...  Can listen to her all day!  She makes me proud to be American again
Man everytime I hear him speak I think of Beverly Leslie from Will and Grace.
OMG , YES!!! 
God, he's so condescending! Glad these tapes are around to prove what hypocrites they are.
HEY A-HOLE TRAITORS Sens @tedcruz @JohnCoryn @ChuckGrassley #Trumprussia PROTECT USA

#SallyYatesIsAPatriot #FlynnSpied
@maddow @JoyAnnReid
Truth trumps Partisan Cover-Up!!! #TrumpRussia War on US Democracy
The Height-Impacted Leprechaun should get out of AG's office before he himself is planted in one of his own private penal institutions.
You know who should follow the law? I am thinking you @AGJeffSessons .
Sally just showed how Superior of mind and morality she is to Sessions
That's a pretty low bar you got there. Pick someone higher up and she'll show them too 
Looks like the chickens have come home to roost, right Beauregard? @attorneygeneral 
Too bad Jeff Sessions doesn't live up to the standards he set in #SallyYates confirmation hearing or follow his own advice.
He passes lawful orders. Yates didn't. Take of your partisan specs
Ah, Jeffy the racist elf. How's it feel when your words come back to bite you in the ass?
@DBloom451 I love how the Trumpsters ignore reality. Listen and learn.
Sally Yate, a wonderful role model for our daughters (and sons even!) of strength, integrity and intelligence.  Trumps? quite the opposite
Republicans are getting what they asked for, and they're going to get it good and hard.
Someone tell Mr. Sessions be careful what you ask for...you might just get it! #TheResistance#SallyYates
Will be interesting to see, going forward, if @jeffsessions lives up to bar he asked #SallyYates to swear to. Can Sessions say NO 2his boss?
What's @jeffsessions still doing hanging around? He lied to Congress. LIED!
It must be fake news, you know, due to the fact that there is a video and a transcript in the library of congress

The irony...
One of the highlights!! #SallyYatesIsAPatriot
Well that was some serious foreshadowing.
I did like that Senator Leahy said that after the others criticized her.
Class act
The GOP don't just deny science and facts, they deny what they said on video. Yates, on the other hand, is very consistent.
she is such a #hypocryte she did nothing when obama was violating the constitution.
Sessions said it so well!!
@Stonekettle
@JohnCornyn @SenTedCruz will the bozos from TX please stand? You both embarrassed yourselves today. Pat yourself on the back.
#YatesHearing: @SallyQYates is a #SuperHero #SallyYatesIsAPatroit
Right on!
This is what integrity looks like
And competence. And cool. And commitment.
Yates FTW
awesome
Awesome, Senator Leahy! So proud of you and Bernie as the senators from my state of birth.
One of the few that has the guts! We need more like her to dig down deep & fess up for our country instead of worrying about party or job!
Think a lot of GOP  compromised, probably being blackmailed for their dirty little secrets
He also, commented that its a shame that Sessions NOW no holds to the ethic he sought to hold Mrs. Yates to during her confirmation.
And from him no less, but then he was playing nice back then. She was the only honest person in Admin and she got fired for doing her job.
@MalcolmNance @SenatorLeahy Yeah - it seems he only wanted it to apply to DEM POTUS.
#SallyYatesIsAPatriot #SallyYates 
I AM SALLY YATES
She is a pure classy lady. She showed tremendous courage, intelligence, tact and integrity. She blocked all of their crap & was 100% sincere
I was only able to listen to her testimony through Cruz, but she was brilliant!
@jeffsessions didn't mean THIS president. He was talking about the BLACK one.
