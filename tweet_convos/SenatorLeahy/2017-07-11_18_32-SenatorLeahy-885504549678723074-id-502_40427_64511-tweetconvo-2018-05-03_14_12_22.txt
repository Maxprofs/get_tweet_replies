Imagine Comcast, which owns NBC, slowing down select streaming services that compete with NBC?
What
if
the 
Internet…
exactly
Here they are with "protections our customers expect" [as defined by us]
We believe in an open internet and giving our customers the Net Neutrality protections they expect. http://comca.st/2temTm2  
It would cause the competitive ISP to act accordingly to attract the customers that don’t like this behavior.
I wish the ISPs were competitive! That would solve many, many problems.
I wouldn't pay for such a shitty service. That's why we have the markets.
Not everyone can do so though unfortunately. That's why the internet needs to stay free for all!
In such circumstances, breaking up the monopoly/oligopoly must be urgent priority.
That's awesome! I imagine Finland has better anti-trust laws/ healthier competition than the US?
We had a pretty good data traffic reform in the 90's. Pretty much free market with little interference.

Well I would be very pissed.
Didn't we the people fund a lot of the Internet
It just about does in Australia thanks to Prime Minister Malcontents Trumble @TurnbullMalcolm and the LNP @LiberalAus farqueing of our NBN
Then you would have traveled back in time to 1996. Congrats.
My thoughts exactly. The day of the forever loading land lines. Hit the button, go get coffee, have sex and maybe it would be uploaded!
Basically how I text
We'd go back to reading print. Books and magazines flourish. Writers get paid again.
That'd be like going back to the horse and buggy, not gonna happen
Most professional writers have felt like buggy manufacturers or blacksmiths since at least 2009.
preach honey preach! i remember writing stories on Quizilla in 2009/2010 and when I found wattpad in 2011 become a professional writer on there was an idea now its a reality in 2017 and I go on wattpad to only look at all my old still on there stories

I feel you dog. Hughesnet never resolves anything.
If net neutrality existed 12 years ago the iPhone would've never been made
YAAS PREACH. would android have?
I thought websites had to pay anyway. Since web ads can offset the cost of website maintenance, wouldn't that take the burden off consumers?
Love this
Hah. My first modem was a 2400 baud. That's 2.4 kHz/s.
Brilliant tweet.
Deadline is July 17th. Comments have to be considered to justify change. Refer to:
From Comcast's reputation, I could see them doing this.
Sounds horrible, but then I and millions of others still have slow internet unless we pay for faster internet each month. #netneutrality
Also it will limit use for those unable to afford it. The wealthy will control content. We get enough of that already.
Is just go back to print.
We must never give in, if my ISP breaks net neutrality, I will end my contract and switch to an ISP that doesn't do throttling or none.
Rather use a VPN and bypass ISP throttling.
No, using VPN is not ok as a solution, VPN is too slow, you can't give me 2ms ping or this speed:
Pay off Twitter
@supertomelo here buddy
I would imagine a competing service would be much more popular and out-compete the slow one. That's how markets work, if you didn't know.
Except providers have made it so they map is slit up between them so competition won't happen
Then start a new provider. I bet that would be the most popular one if all the other ones are deliberately selectively slow.
I mean, personally I'd use the quick one. Wouldn't you?
It would be the same thing how Xbox live charged and PlayStation was free, but when PSN saw they could charge for it, they did.

I will change my ISP?
what if they're all the same?
Relocate
Then
I
Would
Change
ISP
or
A
New
ISP
Would
Finally
Have
A
Unique

Point
To
Break
Into
This
Market.
Or
Simply
I'd
Cancel
My
Account.
Not everyone can just cancel, and many live in areas with Legal monopolies. There literally are no other choices
How did such legal monopolies come into existence? Why is there no competition. I wonder if you can see where I'm headed with this.
Because the government allowed & funded them in exchange for infrastructure, which we never got. Now they want all the power with no regs.
So there you have it. This started with interference by the government, and now you want to ask THEM to solve the problem. Breathtaking.
It's too late to pull out and let them do whatever they want. Cost is too high to enter the market and they own all the infrastructure
The least we can do is make them provide a fair product until there are alternatives.
Time to read some Rothbard maybe
Then another company would offer an alternative and everyone would switch?
So like what the internet would still be if we had the US Govt treating it as a utility since the 80s bc ZERO innovation in every other one
What if your ISP had no incentive to invest in its network because of net neutrality
#NetNeutrality
That's been happening a while now, hasn't it?
I mean that's literally not how sites are loaded, but okay
If you're old enough to remember dial-up (56k modems), it'd be slower than that.
Well said!
300 baud all over again! Blame your presi-dunceh!
Come to any rural location and you will. Always fixing things for urban areas but not for those rural areas that actually pay taxes.
I kind of like that, actually.
That would totally ruin text-based porn.
I'm not getting how a nation where 50% of adults watch porn, from trisexual liberals to sadomasochistic Evangelicals, are OK with this.
Hmm?
people would be forced to support things they like directly rather than taking the easy way out through the middle man of the ISP
Not how it works.
What if you owned a business and some snowflakes pass a government bill that takes away your right to do what's right for your business.
Point taken.
I’d call that a BBS.

It does this very thing in rural AZ!
We will have traveled back to the beginning of the interet....the 90's.
Don't think they won't destroy the internet, Don't sit by and let it happen @netneutrlity

No More pornotube. No More "Hang on a sec... I HAVE TO answer this tweet."
The internet might actually become an information network again instead of an entertainment network. Signed, nostalgic for 300/1200 baud

I'm old enough to have used to use that internet!
"internet free for all" not free at all, controlled by the government. Real freedom comes from free market
This is annoying me because it doesn't effect me in anyway and it's all over the internet
Internet actually loads ONE LETTER at a time. Million times per second. But nice try.
not this net neutrality shit again, unless the A team rolls up into congress demanding freedom they'll keep doing whatever they want  anyway
Don't move 2 Aus then; we're blessed with NBN Lite copper network linked 2 fibre & seriously regulated by providers who pay 2 much 2 access.
FCC wants 2 give MORE POWER to Verizon & other. Do NOT lose more control over how, what, where, when & why u communicate? #NetNeutrality 
@lindsayepeters1
There is no reason to think that would  happen. Competitively and financially it would make sense for nobody.
That's not already happening?
Sounds awful. I'm so glad there are no slow lanes.

What if the website of a hardware store in Australia loaded a tenth of a second slower? Is that a reason for giving Nefflix a better deal?
What if the only functional sites were right-wing propaganda sites. Breitbart all day and all night.
Why would you want Govt controlled Net Neutrality, when the internet is working. You are promoting Orwellian globalist controls.
What if we stopped trying to scare people with "what if" scenarios that are not going to happen...
Love it!!

Once #BigGovt lays its hands on the Internet, regulate it as Net Neutrality & taxes permit, there will be NO end to the control.  Hands-off!
FCC should regulate point A to B type utilities, not a complicated Internet ecosystem.  Totalitarian countries similarly reg Internet.
Support net neutrality!!!!!!!!
Does no one remember 56kBaud AOL?

Power light is off. You're not playing anything on that modem until you plug it in.

DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHIPPERSNAPPERS EVERYTHING?
I just sent in my support for #NetNeutrality last night! I hope everyone else does too!!!
,.,
Think about it in order to compete online companies will pay more and more to ISP.  Prices for customers will go up...  keep net neutrality.
Mine is practically that slow already.
Thank you!!!
Practically a reality in Australia. #slow #broadband #narrowband
People don't understand this issue now but they will bitch about it when it passes. It needs way more coverage. #NetNeutralityDay
Don't spam my sidekick please ^^
So true
It'd actually allow ISPs to invest in better, faster & extended networks by getting internet giants who benefit most to cofund infrastucture
Hey where have I seen this shit before.
Are GOP make Internet for US avalable only for the riches!
It
would

Now the kids will know what it was like back in the dial-up days. :>
I am old enough to remember when it did.  We cannot go backwards.
We actually don't need ISP, cellphones & other devices can form P2P network which cannot be shut down, and the network will be total free
Nice connection you got there. Shame if anything would happen to it. #TellecommsRacket
We'd still be able to shop at normal speed on amazon. What else do we need?
Expected societal outcome explained in #BlueScreen @TheDanWells - face facts - #internet is a #utility not a luxury, & #regulate accordingly
I just keep thinking about that old movie - Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. Except this is real life. Lol

Just now placed charge of Internet traffic
Then maybe someone would be fast enough to knock the phone from Trump's tiny hands before he started another twitter feud. #SilverLining
Oh, like the 1200 baud modem days! Yeah, that'd be progress
Rural OK. I work from home & need reliable service. I pay $275/mo for broadband. Tons of buffering, no loading email. 1 new Co. same price.
What if the government didn't have power and control over yet one more thing?
Like the old days of modems and AOL with cached content
This is time where I'll start reading books instead
Surely we will still be able to experience the Web as we like simply giving away that little bit of privacy still left? :D
I guess the technicality of "nothing would show up for minutes until the complete payload is delivered" is not the kind of comment you seek?
Yes, we called that a BBS
I do pay off my ISP.
Then you would have the Australian NBN
I remember dial up.
What is reason to change current system?  If it's not broke don't fix it
I know that is an emoji after the hashtag, but it still gives me anxiety <<shutters>>
I'm totally with you on net neutrality, but in this example I found it visually easier to read than a normal tweet!
Do you not think it leaves a margin for competition, in that case?The U.S. is shooting themselves in the foot & people will turn elsewhere!
What if citizens boycotted candidates who refuse to sign a #RecallGuarantee to oppose any bill that reduces net neutrality?
@SirSteven life in.....*refresh*....china.
It's called Spectrum/Time Warner's usual service

Net Neutrality II: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO) https://youtu.be/92vuuZt7wak  via @YouTube
I'd eventually end up reading more books
Okay...
Then i would leave them for another ISP, oh wait, gov cronyism, down to local level, has removed my choices. Thanks 4 wanting more of that.
this is what is happening in Zimbabwe. It's very slow and even our Twitter doesn't show images unless you uz an expensve daily data bundle

@kristenschaaled That already happened: It was called AOL.
What if one company (e.g. #Netflix ) used up so much "free" bandwidth that is slowed everything and everyone else down? #NetNeutrality
this is what wap use to be like...
Freedom of press and freedom of speech easily suppressed.
Awful!
I remember internet in the '90s
How did you fit that all in one tweet
Well if Trump and his minions get their way net neutrality will go bye bye and you'll find out the answer to that question
I would be okay with that! 
Of course we should pay higher fees to our ISP for those sites to have unlimited bandwidth for free because - because why exactly?
Nic bro....don't screw with me like that....
What if grandma had balls?
@KEEMSTAR this guy practically stole your tweet!

Doesn't matter if u don't have a big 4 isp
yes keep title 2 to prevent it from happening
@ijustine so I'm not very tech savvy. What do we do to fix all this? Or is there nothing we can do?
@bryanlanning funny no one had a problem. People were confused about net neutrality. 2 years later and people act like it's
been around for 17 years.
I cannot more perfectly express what will happen if the ISP MAFIA get to shake down small businesses.

That Wired is using it's status to be SO dishonest about this is really quite sickening
If we had #NetNeutrality in the 90s we'd still have the same internet. There's just ZERO innovation under Govt boots. Can't trust em either
Ever use a BBS at like 1200 baud? #firstworldmodemproblems
@BoredElonMusk wow same tweets
The best solution seems to be to have the government regulate it so that all of us get just one word at a time. Fair is fair.
Brilliant
Where were you all during the election? You knew if Repubs took over the FCC this would happen.
that's comcast.
You mean the way dial-up used to? If you lived in a rural area it could take half an hour to change pages.
