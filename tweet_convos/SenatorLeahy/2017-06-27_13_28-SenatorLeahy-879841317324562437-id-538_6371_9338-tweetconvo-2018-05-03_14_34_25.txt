In weekend interview, Fox News analyst asked Trump "how frustrating is it to have former president Obama … leading the resistance?"
Pete is a Fox news Contributor. In other words, a pundit for hire. Not a news staffer, or analyst. Not affiliated with hard news division.
Not sure your point. His gig is “providing analysis and commentary” and Fox trumpeted this interview.
Seems like you're inferring that Pete is throwing softballs from the more journalistic side of Fox. He's as "hard news" as Piers Morgan.
@BraddJaffy My eyebrows are fine.  I hope they run as far away as they can and enjoy themselves.
Sounds like you’ve raised them well.
it's news because they're finally paying for their vacations.
Was it worthy of being the lead news story in America this afternoon?
Pathetic
They won't even know who to blame when their insurance is gone.
I laughed but it's not funny. They'll say it was Obummer.
Fox News does realize the Obama is no longer president, right?
Why the obsession with Obama? Thought he was supposed to be irrelevant...
FOX News: State propaganda arm of the GOP.
No longer acceptable: "FOX analyst", "reporter", even "commentator"; from now on they must b called "actors" that r "performing 4 the crowd"
Yes, Obama take a vacation....
President Obama is presently a former president and doesn't really have a job so he relaxes. He can afford it and he earned it.
Fox News is not news. It's propaganda for stupid people.
Well that's @BUTTNews at your service, always ready and willing to lie and mislead.
and they're going after a PRIVATE CITIZEN for going on vacation??
@MariaTCardona why can't the Obamas go on a lavish vacation?
The only eyebrows O's vacations are raising are FOX News' . He's earned his damn time off, unlike their useless golf playing President.
And folks wonder why we have a "Divided Nation."
Here's the divide: Dummies and Racists vs. Truth Seekers and Caregivers.
Nothing like #ObamaEnvy
HA!!
They sent crack head  Conway  to the hill to change minds SURE we know what she's  doing
They know their audience only want to hear about winning and more winning. Freaking fake Foxnews
@mcspocky it lowered my eyebrows as I wondered who the F cares if Obama goes on vacation
Oh come on...we all know that FOX is the only 'real' and not 'fake' news outlet...so I'm sure the Obama's must be taking a vacation, right?
@FoxNews  still suffering from #ObamaDerangementSyndrome ? You better act fast before @GOP takes away your health insurance!
Because what should anger you is a black guy enjoying his vac, not a bunch of rich guys taking your ins away to make their friends richer
@FoxNews #FoxFakeNews #FoxNewsLies. @DonaldJTrumpJr when are you going to complain about THIS #FakeNews ?
See, even #FauxNews /Fox News misses them!
If I didn't know any better, I'd say Fox has a crush on Obama...
Fox News is the state sponsored media.   First step to dictatorship
Good for them!!! They deserve the most lavish fun filled vacations ever!!! #Obama2020
#resist FoxFartsFakeNews is rabidly jealous of the Obamas. Always has been, always will be.
LOL at Fox....aka Pravda
@SarahHuckabee and how about those Obamas? 
#wut?
So what if the Obamas take vaactions? He's not POTUS anymore. Tell @realDonaldTrump to stop golfing and start governing.
They're just pissed off because a black man is successful and enjoying his success.
What a joke. Obama was wealthy before he was president. Maybe not Trump wealthy (allegedly), but wealthy enough he can take nice vacations
Because Faux Noise has #ObamaDerangementSyndrome - but Trump can travel to his golf courses and have govt. rent space at Trump Tower.
Fox is as bad as Breitbart.
News flash: Obama's not the president anymore. What he does is his business. Meanwhile your shitstain with the mop on his head wastes cash.
You know, when I see Obama vacationing, I smile. He deserves it!
What's with the pic? Why does this guy have his hands around Obama's throat??
It seems that Trump is not alone in his Obama obsession.
"We report you decide"
More like we decide not to report.
When obama was president the same thing happened. Guess you forgot this. MSNBC and CNN never criticized Obama for 8 yrs. Name one time
Fox lives in the past. No news here...
Really fox stop with up ur FAKE NEWS TRUMP IS PRESIDENT NOW
What? Faux News has nothing about the Clintons? Unheard of
@JohnJHarwood I know how Fox News feels-I wish Obama was still President, too.

Really @FoxNews really? At least make an attempt at pretending you're an actual news station
@CahnEmily Now THAT is real news I can use.

I want to know which democrats are raising their eyebrows? I'm 100% in favor of the Obamas enjoying civilian life 
Lol fox right on topic
Further proving the reason we have a moron in charge is because we elected a black man twice... 
Fox has neglected to point out Trump's taxpayer funded golfing trips. Hypocrites!
And guess which one of the three our esteemed president thinks is "real" news? 
 Fox News. The Obama's are private citizens give it a rest and report some news. Like #TrumpRussia #DeathCareBill #EPAtrying2killUS
congress may not be in DC next week but don't let up on this fight
Hope the Obama's are having a wonderful time! Wish them only the best life can bring.
um...they earned it?  8 years with no scandals and conducting themselves with dignity - miss those days!!  Fox News=45 propaganda machine
Good the bill was garbage anyway... unfortunately for progressives that's hard to see. Oh wait I forgot you pose as conservative. Giggle
When you have nothing of substance on your side [Trump, GOP], keep running a campaign against the other side.
Obamas take well deserved holiday after a job well done. Trump ruins the country in between his golf playing days
At least Obama waited till he was no longer president to be on vacation!  How many days has DT spent golfing...
Gotta go with what's really imortant to the nation...
#FoxLameNews
Ah, parallel universes
And we wonder why the GOP can't govern
Is Fox News unable to cover Trumps golf holidays? Excessive!
@FoxNews needs to find a new hobby & move on from obama lol
@FoxNews @foxandfriends you are an embarrassment to the country and the world! #FoxLies #TrumpISFakeNews #TrumpCrimeFamily
Trying to say that it bums out Dems? Seriously? Most that I know are happy he's having a good time, after the crap he's been through.
The one thing Fox and right wing media have in common with everybody else - they miss Obama terribly.
@SykesCharlie cannot fathom why section of America wld choose 2 live in this fake alternative fox spews. Wht does it accomplish?
@SykesCharlie Faux News want to keep Obama hate flaming bc it's only way to keep the base fired up & keep it unimformed.
Perhaps this is why Fox has been consistently getting third place ratings.
@FoxNews can't stand that Obama, a successful author & retiree with a pretty good pension plan, has his own money and can
 a good life
I know he is the former president, but why is it a concern for a person who retired to take vacations even if expensive.  He is retired
@yabutaleb7 They want the Obamas 2b as miserable as they R b/c no one but them love trump
@BarackObama no one has ever smiled this much since leaving a job. That should tell you something. #bestprez
That leading sure looks like fun
Why would they want to focus on Obama's vacation is beyond me.  FOX is a failing news organization.  They are more like Entertainment TV.
No one with critical thinking skills ever confused Fox News v with actual news...
Who cares what Obama does now. He did his job and Fox News has nothing to talk about because They are tabloid.
And I have to ask myself. The O's are private citizens. What they do now isn't anyone's business why does Fox care? addition to Fake news?
It's all about stoking racial resentment. You know people "like him" are not supposed to be living so well.
Wow!  Fox News, your source for unimportant and fake news!!!
Changing Faux news to 'Don't give a Fugg news"
And when Chuck Todd interviewed Bernie last weekend, he somehow forgot to ask him about the FBI investigation into him, what's your point?
This is so embarrassing, @FoxNews.
As long as healthcare is a business it's not healthcare it simple in this country it's all about the money that includes healthcare
FOX hates that Obama (a) survived 8 years and (b) has moved on to embrace a loving, successful and joyful life. Drives them NUTS

Wizard of the senate? filtrate money from big business NRA Koch's Oil & apparently the American ppl then yes #mcconnellrapacity it sucks!
I think this might be the "dishonesty" @SarahHuckabee was referring to?
Nah.
@MeganSmith IF True, (& I DO NOT believe anything from Fox(NON)News) but if true, Democrats ARE FOOLS
Not sure which story you are talking about.
Apparently Democrats are angry with #POTUSOBAMA because he's enjoying life too much & spending loads of HIS OWN Money!
He did his part. Now it's time for them to get off their collective asses and do theirs.
@Fox news You're NOT a news organization, you're the propaganda arm to 45. You're all a joke!
1stl. He worked his ass off for 8 years So fuck them.2nd FOX News has been systematically brainwashing the week minded since day 1
So fuck them and Soylent Green is people.
FOX is giving The Onion a run for it's money.


When can we call Faux News official State TV #moscowdreaming ? Absolutely ludicrous.
Ya' know what raises MY eyebrows? No one complaining abt #Trumpgolf
Hate sells and they know who their viewers hate.
FOX on par with Enquirer.
I don't understand why fox cares so much about someone that doesn't give a damn about fox. Focus on the president
Just shows that there is not much good news surrounding @realDonaldTrump  and @gop. Healthcare is failing. SAD. So they go after Obama. LAME
@TerriGeorge18 He's not the president, he can do as he wishes.
Pretty soon when congress will start the impeachment @FoxNews headline will be: Obama still black - just rile up their 80 years old
Anyone..anyone..not see the fox network for what it is!
@foxnews @foxandfriends Look at legitimate headlines, then check your 'headline' ...Pathetic, don't you think?! Derangement continues @ Fox!
@JoyAnnReid Fox News:reporting the hard stories 
I think he made a DEAL with faux to bring their ratings up: No sound or video during briefings and only they get interviews afterward
The DNC doesn't write everyone's news.
Love that the best they can do is go after Obama's vacations - just enhances image of Trump golfing very weekend.
It's really tough for Fox and the GOP to not have a bogeyman to kick around.
@FoxNews ???
Faux news is a joke that will go down in flames with Orange man. @FoxNews
Can't go on vacation if you're black apparently
Gotta keep on Donnies good side.
@NetworkJunkyz So funot how Fox & @realDonaldTrump keep trying to distract & deflect to cover up lies & @GOP crappy legislation.
Next to story about Obama relaxing (God forbid) is photo showing white man "strangling" him. No subliminal racist violence there, nope.
Fox News is Hate News.
@CitizensFedUp #Veterans 
MSNBC: Health Bill Delayed
CNN: Time Not on GOP's Side
Fox News: It'a Obama's Fault
MESSAGE to FoxNews: GFY
Fux News "we're all gonna die anyway so who cares about healthcare..."
DEPLORABLE 
FOX
(not really news)
PROPAGANDISTS 
#
Faux news is the American Pravda for trump. #FakeNews
@FoxNews fake news
Faux news is still hung up on The Obamas...just like Trump.  #jelousy
Forget Fox News. Focus on healthcare. The minute we're not fighting this bill it will sneak through just like in the house. /1
We have to call/write/fax/tweet and protest our reps all day everyday for the next 4 years or Trumpcare will happen. /2
Give them a break it can't all be fox n friends& really all they got is Obama hate.If there fans figure out what a mess this is catastrophe
And he's  not President anymore so what's the problem jealous
yes, he's taking well-deserved vacations! He slaved his ass off for 8 years & @foxandfriends treated him like a slave throughout!
Obama is a private citizen & can do whatever the fuck he wants. Esp taking summer vacations with his family. He has 2 school aged kids. Duh.
Oh sweet Jesus.
Seriously? @FoxNews is STILL talking about the Obamas? Sorry, never watch them, and I don't understand-it's not news. Should be FoxStories
Hey, Putin's a stern taskmaster.
Irresponsible to the point of treasonous.
This is why we can't have nice things. Racists sought out Fox, now it's making them even MORE ignorant so they fight against fighting back.
What Dems are those, fox? No proof as usual.
Fox is trying to anger us and divert our attention from healthcare. It's not gonna wash.
Poor FOX. Things were so easy when all they had to do was make fun of Obama. Now they've got to report on the GOP clown circus. Tough break!
That damn black guy. RUINING EVERYTHING EVEN AFTER HE IS OUT OF OFFICE
State media...
Y is it news what a private citizen does with his time Fox Fake News?
When Trump does his constant golfing, he's charging taxpayers to support him &  using the Presidency as a marketing device.
That's why @FoxNews is 3rd.  No IMPORTANT news. If they're going to focus on R&R, how about Trump's constant golfing weekends at his resorts
Because, Fox doesn't actually report news. They just try to find things to stir up hate. BTW, haven't seen anyone worried about vacations.
It's almost like @FoxNews never told the truth and just wanted Angry Old White Racist #MAGA voters to exist and pay @billoreilly #Petty
Once again establishing irrevocably in the mind of every Trumpster that there are two #FakeNews stations and Fox
It's NOT #FoxNews. Its Trump's #InfomercialChannel @jayrosen_nyu @jeffjarvis @Sulliview @JoeNBC @morningmika @GStephanopoulos @CharlesMBlow
history will remember @FoxNews as the beginning of the end for the United States of America.
they've earned it. What is 45's excuse? Lazy self serving old man
And That's why they removed the Fair and Balanced tag line!
Big deal.  The Obamas take a vacation.  They are private citizens and have the right to do so.
@KathrynAMurdoch Does this embarrass you at all or do you just cash the check and 'let them eat cake' while our Republic slips away.
@FoxNews- #Obama was amazing POTUS so @TheDemocrats aren't mad, just you republicans. If he golfed daily like POTUS45 he wdnt need vacation.
In the 40 years I've been an adult, I don't recall so much focus on a former President. Maybe Fox needs ratings.
...Heh... Fox prints the truth... hey, 'truth'... isn't that 'Pravda' in Russian?...
Fox is just gonna be TMZ Obama from now on
That's right folks on the right nothing to see here nothing in politics going on today just the Obamas taking a vacation how dare they
How many more years can slurs on Clinton and Obama keep Fox viewers distracted from the real world? Serious question, how stupid?
Keep em un/ill informed and hateful.
Dan, were you critical of MSM giving Obama Softball questions for 8 years? Of course you weren't b/c you're a part of the DC problem

Hahahaha...it's Obama's fault...and emails...
Why is anyone worrying about the Obama's vacations? They are in the private sector. It's their business what they do now! Trump plays golf!
How dare the Obamas take a vacation... what a scandal! Meanwhile, Trump's on a brain vacation every single day.  FORE!
Is anyone still surprised by FOX NEWS #fuck foxnews.
@ScorpSandypandy @immigrant4trump there is real NEWS you might want to flip the switch on @FoxNews for trying to brainwash you.
so glad Obama's having a great life on vacation the smile is contagious he deserves Good Times
Fox News wishes it was on vacation with the Obamas.
So Fox wants President Obama back in the White House?
Oh brother! Insanity rules at FOX and the White House.
Fox is just silly
Obama publishes how many books? Takes a vacation but Trump can play golf at Mara Lago and pay himself for the privilege?
@FoxNews statetv. Breaking......Do bears really shit in the woods or is that another one of Obama's lies? Stay tuned
Naturally
Lmao
