Once built, the State Dept. has estimated the Keystone XL pipeline will employ about 35 people. http://n.pr/2ncSrqO 
@LindaCollins11 more jobs lost Macy's alone to B concern
So, it's another "jobs, jobs, jobs" success for Chump?
Does anyone actually clean up their oil spills? thats gotta be a few more jobs, right? Throw some EPA people at it
didn't you hear? EPA is extinct
no significant#of jobs created-known then-MSM just let the GOPspout their talking points(lies) w/out refuting as usual
@JoyceCarolOates What's the estimate on Russian steel imports on that job? Who gets rich on that aspect of the project?
Maybe they'll employ another 35 to clean up the inevitable, massive oil spills...
First, do you believe anything you hear on NPR? Then, does that number sound remotely conceivable for the job?
35 employees; that's about right.
Repubs are a joke. How r they NOT embarrassed? Oh yeah they don't care about anybody but rich folks and corporations.
& we can't forget ALL THE U.S. steel it will use. Oh, wait...DJT has stock in pipeline company...I mean Russian stee
Consistent with the rest of 45's policies, it only benefits energy co's without regard for real consequences.
At the risk of sounding like a Dothraki, it was known.
@SenatorLeahy Ben we already know your dishonesty and what lengths you went to to hide the facts. #noethics #obamasyncophant
@theonlyadult As a former oil worker, I can attest, pipelines ALWAYS hurt workers by reducing decent-paying blu-collar positions.
The jobs oil cos always tout are just temp construction. Once built, almost ALL trucker & well jobs are cut.
#Resist
Temporary jobs at Trumps winery too. $10 an hour. So things are moving in the right direction!
Burns me up how they depress wages & bust unions while claiming to be "FOR the working man."

#Resist
Hey, anything is fair if it helps destroy the environment, right?
That's 2 less than the number of Benghazi hearings. Now only if we had 10,000 Benghazi hearings....
@jonfavs They need to focus on creative Obama jobs like minimum wage retail & service jobs without benefits 
@nhdogmom @Patta47cake @BretBaier @TeamCavuto Another clasdic GOP lie exposed;Keystone was always scam to boost oil co profits.
you're ignoring the spill clean-up jobs and the steel jobs in Russia
@KatTalesTV yeah 35 American and loads of Russian steel makers
@SenatorLeahy @realDonaldTrump 35 jobs & NOT USING AMERICAN STEEL!! MAGA .. what a con !
WOW!  Now that's #MAGA....  What a joke
No no no, you've totally missed the point. Think of all the cleanup jobs created when it leaks!
You think cleaning crude oil of an otter or a duck is a chore, just imagine how many people it takes to clean it off a Buffalo!
@jonfavs
More Senators voted for the #KXL than the number of jobs it would have created. #JustSaying
oil $$$ seems to get everyone's allegiance..good or bad..
THIS IS JUST EVIL
This is what I call bringing jobs back to America. Well done @GOP & @realDonaldTrump. So great it brings a tear to my eye.
Don't forget the Russian steel czar who thought he was getting a big ol' handout from comrade Trumpovich
@MWJ1231 It seems Trump does a lot of boasting about how good he is at getting things done, but nothing has materialized yet.
Looking forward to seeing you in prison.  #traitor
@ericgarland the jobs come from building it
@Hesiod2k11 @NPR Keep reporting this
@ericgarland And use inferior Chinese steel.
@ericgarland And were using Russian steel! America!
@NPR wait, why is the State Dept the source for domestic jobs forecasting?
@BarbaraHershey8 Well, and let's not forget: that oil is headed for China! They own most of the Canadian company, too. #NoXL
How many jobs does it create to build it and how long is the project?
I wonder how many jobs will be lost because of it, too? Transporting oil, etc, other ways
You do realize that pipelines are always built by contractors, right? it's a long  term thing...
@thegarance How many people are employed running solar power plants, or bridges, or roads... I think you're missing something...
@ericgarland Thousands of jobs! Yeah, building it, then...bye
@giacomonyt Kills a bunch of trucker jobs though right?
liberals clearly don't know how construction jobs work. 
Once built.
@POTUS will end up with yuuge votes from those 35 people. It will be like 350 thousand for sure
I think the odds of winning the lottery are better
@EdenSarbanes @NPR minus all of the governments jobs being lost due to proposed budget cuts it's not looking good for job numbers
unreal.
@jonfavs   The pipeline is designed 2line pockets of the very wealthy investors only!  It hurts the environment and is not needed!
@FoxNews @CNN  yep the world  is now being told just how much U& @BarackObama admin have been listening
Too bad they were not listening to al Qaeda in #Benghazi or to Lois Lerner while targeting
selective listening skills
@jonfavs to be fair, that's more people than the state dept employs these days...
Well, at least they are using US Steel.
@JuddApatow But with the prospect of a catastrophic breach, thousands could be employed in environmental clean-up, healthcare...
Others will b employed in time, when it leaks - ppl will b needed to clean up
@isnt_it_rich maga my arse
And make billions for about three peeps.
This is exactly why your government funds are being cut
You keep out the economic impact and just point to jobs
now the GOP will say that if we just set up 10 million of these we will have 100% employment.
35 people: far fewer than those that will be poisoned by spills and the promotion of fossil fuels.
@jonfavs this was a coffee out the nose laugh
@alania1985 ppl are too stupid to think for a sec and realize the whole purpose of pipelines is to transfer oil without need of ppl
@NickHanauer this fact won't be on any media viewed by Trump voters
Yessss!!! This means #DollHands only needs to create another 11,999,965 more jobs to catch up to Obama
@jonfavs In fairness, the inevitable spills will create a few more jobs.
@marcylauren Hahahahaha!
@jonfavs but they're using steel made in USA! Oh, wait, no...
@nycsouthpaw Yes but 35 of the best most talented people.
Did they forget to type a few zeros?
@jonfavs but when it breaks there'll be tons of clean up jobs!
@jonfavs @NPR Are any full time?  Or just all part time with no benefits or health insurance?
@jonfavs and we get to pay the 38M bill for terrorizing standing rock.
@jonfavs OH don't forget American Steel!!  Wait what..they lied about that? But DT said at KY rally American steel. Oh he lied 
Are you getting psyched for those prison showers yet? I hear you should try to just relax.
@jonfavs Yes, but it really pisses off liberals, so it's all good.
@everly_ohara Don't forget, this is foreign-owned oil, being shipped thru US to foreign buyers. No effect on domestic market.
@jonfavs it's a pipeline. Google and Facebook are working on an undersea cable in the Pacific. Both of you should work there.
@jonfavs And the Canadian oil will be sold to China.
@jonfavs We've known this for awhile.
@jonfavs I sure hope they're coal miners.
It is.
@jonfavs it's not new news. It's just that trumpers never listen.
@jonfavs that's 35,000 trump-math jobs...score!
@potsherds Jesus wept.
Hurry up - I'm waiting for your next novel that I won't read.
@AJentleson I mean, Beyoncé employs more people 
@woodhouseb until there's a spill. Cleanup and remediation is where the jobs are at. Just ask BP!
Yo Rhodes. This here is the #NoPimpZone. Take dat SPIN to the Russians. I hear they're in the market.
@tparsi what a joke. Just like this administration.
And that's 35 more jobs than you and Barry created!
@NickHanauer -the oil company will cut 20 of those jobs after one year ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
just kidding
no no, there will be more jobs...cleaning oil spills, employing scientists to figure out y all the animals are dying, like that.
@sacca well... #republicans tend to be full of shit #fuckthegop
Yea. A pipeline gets built by 35 people. Good call Jr.
@LilyMarsWrites It just sits there. Aside from monitoring and occnl maint how many does it take to stare at it?
-yup, couple of teenagers jumped a fence here in Canada  turned a big red wheel & shut it down 
about 35 = 32, 33 max
cleaning up the spills will employ a lot more than that. On a temporary basis.
@fierybubbles just make sure Trump gets credit for saving those 35 jobs, okay? Lol
thanks for all the construction jobs guys... guess obama was right after all...again
So, ALL construction jobs should be permanent jobs?
@NPR Don't forget about the cleanup crew.
@Femmevixen  WOW! Amazing.that will probably drop the jobless rate a tremendous amt.
Sure beats spending years making license plates though, huh @brhodes?
If he creates 198,965 more he'll have created one month of Obama-level job growth.
@metaquest @brhodes 
check out this alternative jobs plan
Few jobs; also foreign oil rather than domestically sourced. America loses.
@NPR BEN. Are you getting paid by the number of tweets?
And use Russian steel to build it.
...gonna keep the heat off ya for spying????
Wow Goebbels, NSA to provide proof Obama spied on DT -he'll look good in orange
Trump will repeat that number as 35 million.
yeah. Not thousands of jobs.  Just like everything else the R's say. So painful
how many jobs to build?  Oh that's right, blue collar jobs don't count as much as environmental lawyers.
We need a Republican to English dictionary.  'Jobs' = 'profit,' as in 'our plan to create [jobs].'
Every day it's another lie, let down or disappointment.  When will that final "straw" break and the rebellion begins in earnest?
but at least it will use U.S. steel...? nope.
- Does Bora Bora have an extradition treaty with the U.S. ?
how about jobs cleaning up leaks and spills?
@_AJCousins But tons more volunteers to clean up all the spills!
*cries*
trickle down pipeline? I'm sure once it's built tons of jobs will be created in the rapidly growing oil industry
as if once built, the pipeline does nothing other than sit there
The same number they mentioned years ago. Too much!
You really should stop talking.
but those 35 jobs are worth the environmental toll.
Jobs already exceeded 44 snail  pace!  Don't be envious!  44 made more national debt & more regulations ever seen! #upyours 
Darling, here are the numbers. Now did you vote for W? Bet you did! Bless BOTH your hearts. @brhodes
Somlet me get this straight- the environment is being damaged for 35 jobs?
not for the jobs for profit, I imagine they would reduce those jobs if possible
And that is just for the construction. Construction done, jobs done?
Makes me think about the years the GOP has been talking about a new health bill. And look at it. That party is really something.
Another .... win.
Those will totally offset the people laid off by Sears shuttering its stores, right? We're good!
Yeah 35 jobs and oil for export. What a deal. Why not build a refinery on the Great Lakes. Then we would not pollute the US.
-you do know US states are on the Great Lakes right? And  21% of world fresh water, drinking water for 48 million people?
And they're using imported steel to build it.  When will Trump voters, and all Republicans, face fact that they've been scammed
It's yuge
I believe that is the full-time number
wow a whopping 35 people!
