Wow!
Looks like under trump this is what it's going to look like again. SAD
This is what could happen if you disband the EPA.
Thank goodness we can have that back now! BLARGH!
;  Air pollutants today are more invisible but still very prevalent.
everyone looks so stylish at 1953! Love this picture!
was this the same Fog that gripped Lindon around that same time?
Back by popular demand, Smog, sponsored by the electoral college, & people for a darker, deadlier American!
^@BeschlossDC Smaug over New York City, 1953
@EllenDatlow Ahhh! Trump's good old days.
coal....clean coal @realDonaldTrump
Ah the good old days.  Everything was so much better then.  Better dressed anyway.
Timely post.  Thx.
am in China right now, looks just like that
Agent Orange and the GOP earn for this & taking actions to make it happen.  How Special of them.
@SteveKopack or tomorrow

How in hell can this make America great? It's shameful when you have the science to do better.
With Trumps new rules, those days will return big time.
Get ready to wear masks like they do in Beijing.
Hopefully state regulations will save us from this. #makeamericachokeagain
@davemarashKSFR ..and thanks to @realDonaldTrump 's #NoCleanPower Act, we'll be able to take pix just like this in 6 months.
The day @realDonaldTrump was born?
Johnson asked for clean air & climate legislation in 1965. Nixon signed that law in 1970. Trump would turn back clock.
Oh look, its some of that greatness in the air we keep hearing about.
@SteveKopack I'd to see an updated photo about it right now... It is gotten worse... Sad.
Los Angeles was probably worse. I recall days when breathing hurt and you could taste the air. Burning eyes. Smog alerts.
funny we have kind of forgotten about smog.  Not so common over NYC anymore.....
@maggieNYT @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Do U want this to be your legacy? Should US start wearing face masks like they do in China?
this is China's reality every day of the year.Even worse.
and 2027.
how long before it is that way again, big business doesnt care about people only profits
@BoingBoing Trump's "New Era".
About nine years earlier, a military bomber flew into the Empire State building during fog/smog. The plane got the worst of it.
YUP! we're heading right back to it. @realDonaldTrump Smog is Real. Climate management is real.
@KathyReichs Or maybe "Smog over New York City in 2021"
@EricLiptonNYT ahhh the soupy air of a bygone era.
clearly Trump misses those good old days.
Won't be able to see Trump Tower soon...oops
A timely archival photo to tweet today, thank you. @realDonaldTrump @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP are you paying attention?
@maggieNYT #maga
@elisewho It was strange to see this pic next to a pic from South Korea today. SK worse.
@realDonaldTrump Donald, are you trying to bring these horrid days back to America? B/C gutting #EPA etc will do that. #Resist
No wonder we see so much lung cancer in this generation. Glad we now have such a strong EPA...oh, wait.
@maggieNYT These must be the days @realDonaldTrump would like to return is to
@maggieNYT When America was great!
People have forgotten Mike. Short memory, short attention, short temper, and I'm afraid short on time left for our Mother Earth
Next time it gets that bad again, it will be way too late.
This is Trump's 'Back To The Future' moment. He should be placed in a hyperbolic chamber with it to see the effects.
can't wait to see this again.
@BoingBoing Gotta love business free of regulations! Who doesn't love the smell of industrial "napalm" in the morning?
Nostalgia never quite remembers the way it was! Reminds me of @SpeakerRyan and his Better Way. LOL
@maggieNYT Take a good look,Trump,it will b coming 2 your neighborhood too!It will b a disaster just like ur Presidency.
@maggieNYT Make America Cough Again
Coming soon. Produced & directed by @realDonaldTrump.
We built the EPA for a REASON. Reason that, once upon a time, was supported by BOTH parties. Clean air & water is a no-brainer.
Expect return/more with the new EPA...or absence thereof...
Looks like an L.A. morning
@maggieNYT ...and 2020.
Make America Great Again. 
But......emails
@maggieNYT what does this have to do with Trump EPA deregulation. Seriously. You throw out a pic to draw a baseless conclusion
You see smog, lung cancer and childhood asthma. I see freedom, opportunity and job creation! *cough* *hack*
@maggieNYT Maybe that's what's wrong with that bastard's brain! Who cares if humans BREATHE AIR THAT LOOKS LIKE THAT?!
@maggieNYT #MAGA
@hblodget Well @realDonaldTrump will like it because you won't be able to tell the the true height of the stated Trump Towers.
trump tower will finally have the filth on the outside as well as the inside
@maggieNYT and we would want to back to this why??? Oh yeah. Jobs. NOT
@maggieNYT Sir, I need backup. How do we know it wasn't fog?
If only there were a search engine.. like Google.. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1966_New_York_City_smog …
Thank you. I bow to Wikipedia's reliability. Tap your own knee. I wasn't arguing. Read it again...
@maggieNYT @realDonaldTrump @EPAScottPruitt #MAGA Make America Gag Again
@maggieNYT
#Godzilla!
@maggieNYT Heading back to great again.
great choice of photo today when the prez is touting coal
History is about to repeat itself.   @BeschlossDC @BillWeirCNN
get more pictures
Not just our past anymore, but possibly part of our future.
#CoalisNOTclean #TrumpsDirtyWorld
trump's America
leave it to this administration and this is what will be seeing again near future
hopefully not in 2053 and clean nat'l gas wins the day
@realDonaldTrump Thanks to you, Donald, NYC will look like this again.
Nooooooooooooooo 
@ClaraJeffery Ah, the good old days.
as viewed from Rockefeller Center....
@realDonaldTrump "clean coal, beautiful clean coal"
@ClaraJeffery Going back to this...thanks Trump! So much winning
@GreatDismal Or, as @SecretaryZinke would call it, paradise.
@GreatDismal choke on this TDump family!
@GreatDismal make America great again #MAGA
@IvankaTrump @POTUS your view from Trump Tower in the near future
@ClaraJeffery hard to see the view when it's obscured by so much greatness.
Back when America was "great", and perhaps again after the EPA is crippled
coming soon to a city near you...
There is now smog over the entire country
@Chancedefiant have a coal sandwich.
Trump wants it to be like that again.
@maryannemarsh Smog or a foggy morning? Get real!
Is that ALL ya got Wabbit?  I call the circa 1953 photo being circulated by liberals as BS!
It was TEMPORARY incident; not like it was that way all the time, jerkoff!
OMFG! You're dumber than I thought!  
"Temporary":. I'm still laughing. Let me guess: #FailedPublicEducation.
Make America Emphysematic Again
Trump: Let them breathe cake.
Get used to it folks, @POTUS and his crooked EPA puppet @ScottPruittOK sold our clean air to ExxonMobil.
We may be seeing this again soon thanks to DJT and his minions in their mindless pursuit to gut environmental regs and laws.
And with the EPA being trashed, we can expect a lot of pictures like this in the future.
I love the bedwetters on the left.
@SenatorLeahy that was aweful hope the EPA sees that thinks back and chooses to continue to make things better
Trump has just gutted EPA, and has said he intends to eliminate it.
@maryannemarsh How do we know it's smog. What is your documentation?
. Google is your friend, sir.
Thank you. I did and should have researched prior to asking question, especially of Beschloss!
@SenatorLeahy  Can't wait to read how Beschloss evaluates and records the Trump Administration. Hope we live that long.
Imagine if it had gone unchecked
Everyone in the city would be fat and have this weird orange skin… OMG!
Very apt reminder in light of today's massacre of climate regulations with a stroke of pen by an imbecile
Will be like that again, soon.
Make America Gray Again?
@SenatorLeahy thanks for sharing!
Nice timing.
Those were the days ... we might be getting back to ... thanks to #TeeRump
