An inside look at who else is obstructing justice.
It's a lot more than childish. He's the sitting President. God, I hope the House Dems have impeachment papers ready to go for Jan 2019!
Impeachment is simply a process.Word often used as finality of removal.Not necessarily removal.Depends. Read up on it.
You don't attack people like that unless you are the Child President... then it's ok. #TrumpRussia #SallyYates #impeachTrump
Then do something about it
In a fight for your political life and you don't "attack people like that" yeah ok such ridiculous sentiment
And you don't think it's Illegal?
She defied the immigrant ban based on constitution. Did u listen carefully 2 her response 2 the questions. Carefully!
Well, I think it is an unlawful combination of bullying,  intimidation, retaliation, harassment, in addition to what @SenatorLeahy says. 
I believe it's criminal
Oh 45 great he doesn't take a paltry salary.He donates it n takes tax write off.Why take salary when U can make millions w U R govt expenses
Leahy has always been a ultra-partisan, why should be expect anything different?
If he felt that way he would do something to stop him from witness intimidation via twitter
But his wife is going to work in the state dept. and I think he'll wish wash on this too
Oops thought it was McCain. Ignore me
She's a professional. She did exactly what she was sworn to do. You don't attack ppl like that 
Unless guilty n she wasn't guilty. She did her job according to constitutionally of XO on immigrant ban.
Hello, I represent the Association of tolerated Children. My clients are deeply disturbed by Sen Leahy's characterization of children.
Da fuq?
Leahy is one of my favorite politicians; I don't give that accolade lightly. Have known him 30+ yrs. Perfect? No. But a true leader. <3
Unlike so many, he understands give and take, is a STAUNCH supporter of actions to help women, children, minorities. & ACTS, not just words.
Unfortunately, the time is nigh for him to retire. As a VT'er am TERRIFIED of what/who may follow. :(
Maybe "Sane" people don't attack an ethicly  professional person.

DjT, is neither sane nor a professional. He is pathological lying thief!
Impeachment is in order!
The dems have all their paid tweets out I see. Defending the lawbreaker Yates. Disgusting
Do your research. U R not judge n jury. Yates reported facts given to her to WH attorneys. That was her job.
Trump is running scared!!!
It IS childish & unbecoming for a President of the United States to behave like that.
You don't attack ppl like that unless u have no dignity.
A voice of reason.
@Rebecca_221B  of course - #45 is a case of Arrested Development. @GOP
And doesn't understand proper English #Resistance
Council..NOT.. Counsel
Its Counsel?She explained it 2 WH attorneys?
Ask a republican that, and let's see what the answer is.

#resist
U mean 45s lack of knowledge supporters.
Typical DJT behavior. Look at his history. BS and bullying that's his routine. He's always been mean & childish, but we let him do it. Why?
Childish? It looks to me like business as usual in the US political circus. Yeah...guess you're  correct...CHILDISH. No adult supervision.
CHILDISH YES!
He's developmentally 2yr old:
NO impulse control,tantrums,
uncontrolled angry outbursts
habitual lying and contrary behavior
Thank you @SenatorLeahy Please take the traitor DOWN!!!!  This is all so wrong!!!!!!  #Trumprussia #russiagate
How refreshing "she's a professional" and "she did what she was sworn to do".  Imagine that.
He @realDonaldTrump is a man child makes sense
Childish attempt to obstruct justice and to intimidate a witness; impeachable offenses. #ImpeachTrump
Obstruction of justice and/or intimidation of a witness is a crime.
If Yates is professional & did what she's supposed to do, then the prez.........
Childish?!?  Try illegal #intimidation
"You don't do that.."   Unless you're @realDonaldTrump   #Classless45
Thank you @SenatorLeahy 

Love this Senator!!!
My hero!! Speaking the truth!
Worse than childish. It's called trying to intimidate a witness. Should be called out for what it is. Witness tampering
@gmo1stmimi What is anybody going to DO about the presidents attack on YATES!!! Was his attack big man hit and run attack? Such a baby, DJT!
@realDonaldTrump - senior Senator says you were childish.... finally someone is calling you out for your childish behavior.
#ImpeachTrumpNow
Paws up!!  Love calling him out on that, thanks Kyle.
Just childish @SenatorLeahy ? What about obstruction of justice?
Not just childish â€” it's malicious.
Omg Lindsey Graham turned in his opening statement. Now this. This is the best day!
or witness tampering
I think so too
More than childish, criminal and malicious.Intimidating witnesses for personal gain. #resist
He is childish, narcissistic and crazy
No, it was an attempt to intimidate the witness
It's more than that, it's witness intimidation.
Why isn't #MSM talking obstruction?
"She told the truth, she kept her word -- she did exactly what she was sworn to do.  You don't attack people like that."   
Old drunk Leahy dfends a known law breaker. He is pitiful. #TermLimits
You are pathetic. He's my Senator and never , and not a, drunk. Get a grip.
Childish?  Try criminal!
Trump is a scared petulant child caught in a lie. His threats were intended to intimidate Sally Yates! It's time to investigate treason.
Childish? How about "illegal", Senator?
YOU'RE RIGHT!!!  @gmo1stmimi
Long admirer of @SenatorLeahy, he gives simple straightforward response.
Pro Journalism Tip: When politicians use the term "childish" that is code for BULLSHIT. #Resist
Donald Trump is childish, idiotic, petulant .. & a criminal
#ImpeachTrump 
#TrumpRussia 
@realDonaldTrump @PressSec @SenateMajLdr
"Now go to your room and think about what you've done."
beautiful response
you don't attack people like that unless you are GUILTY
AMEN!!!
He didn't say "no"!
VT don't play
ayy represent
Thank You
Speak The Truth
Shame The Devil
Actually its illegal and childish.
Ask Leahy if he's ok w/ Kushner Co using his image to sell visas in China
Here's a slide shown during Kushner Co. event in Beijing identifying @realDonaldTrump as "key decision maker" on EB-5 investor visa program 
Isn't witness tampering a felony?
