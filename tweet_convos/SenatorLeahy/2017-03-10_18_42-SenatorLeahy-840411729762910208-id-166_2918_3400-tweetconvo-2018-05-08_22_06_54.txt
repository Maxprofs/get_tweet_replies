BS, EVERY WORD! But nice try! 
that's right - #TrumpSupporters ignore #facts b/c it's easier to make up your own.
eeeegadddss! This is lunacy!!!
Trump thinks the rules don't  apply to HIM. He's never had accountability til NOW #Trumpism
They all knew, didn't want People to know, gigantic cover up. Pence knew from the start.
Imagine Susan Rice being NSA to Obama and not disclosing she repped foreign interests. Immediate indictment.
But, Pence just learned about this?  Guess Pence wasn't engaged with transition team which he led.
Legal Schmegal......you heard Spicer...he was a private citizen.....advising a man about to become ..oh wait
@ntmyprez @realDonaldTrump you misspelled Nazi.
Theater of the absurd no doubt - when will the curtains come down ?
Correct! One douchbag at a time please! We'll deal with him when he's Pope...errr, POTUS 2018!
this administration habitually denies involvement. Then lies/explains it away.
they told him first to wait on filing as a foreign agent. Then they made him NSA. Only the best right.
#LockHimUp
@sweetcher62 @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost and it's business as usual at White House...Freaking out on what I see and read
This is just....all very very astounding. And yet we just carry on. I don't get it.
whaddya gonna do? Call a cop? These things take time! Re watch All the Presidents Men for context!
So Trump & Pence still denying they knew anything?
@Hc2016Now @washingtonpost That seems to break some kind of law
"might" register? Isn't it required by law that he register? So much for Trumps "law and order". LOCK HIM UP!
@GhostPanther @realDonaldTrump When will Trump register as a foreign agent?
I don't think they see the conflict!!!!!
"Really," Trump said. "I'm a foreign agent, too."
- he might "have to" register
@GhostPanther @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost And he called Hillary "crooked." Trump admin is crooked on steroids. #p2 #tcot
Project, Distract, Deny!
so here we have evidence of another Trump lie!
@brucepknight @realDonaldTrump @VP PENCE LIED!!!
...AMERICA...to hell in a handbasket thanks to a unqualified lying supposively billionaire
And who was head of team? Pence.
Honest question- how are conservatives rationalizing that this is OK?
whaooo! And he still got approved by Gop? Backdoor US intelligence 4sale to our adversaries
all pawns of exxon if you ask me
Not even a DOUBLE Face Palm is enough for this kind of lousy decision.
"I hire the best people."
the media and the ppeople will learn who the real Trump is with time

did #trump loose his copy of Prez guide for Dummies or just thinks rules don't apply? @SenSchumer #corrupt
He missed a golden opportunity to be someone that counts by picking qualified people. But a fail. Trouble.
Yes, knowing that he would never getting through vetting for the VP slot where he was on the short list.
@djrothkopf @realDonaldTrump @AshleyRParker - this is not about a conspiracy, it's about the stupidity of blind loyalty!
good of him to consider it. 
being the idiot he is Trump probably had no idea what that was but thought it sounded tough.
Yet Reps like Steve King is placing party before country. Unbelievable.
@JJohnsonLaw Great judgement!
Bush was incompetent but he wasn't evil. Cheney was evil. Trump is incompetent and evil. And crazy. & immature
If this is all part of Steve Bannon's plan to disrupt and agitate, it's certainly bringing out the best in actual journalists.
.@fahrenthold this administration is averaging at least one WTF revelation every day
Flynn told Trump team he might register as a foreign agent. @realDonaldTrump made him Natl security advisor anyway. https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/flynn-told-trump-team-he-might-register-as-a-foreign-agent/2017/03/10/7e30713a-05cb-11e7-b9fa-ed727b644a0b_story.html?tid=sm_tw&utm_term=.58a789fd3651 …
@AshleyRParker you don't say?
@ericgarland   Trump is literally & figuratively playing Russian Roulette with America-so far we're losing BIGLY
@ericgarland @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost  Is this what the GOP Pres meant when he said he hires the best people?
He was not just a foreign agent but an agent for a country careening toward authoritarianism and Islamism & flirting with ISIL.
@ericgarland @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost I think *many ppl* said it a little like this,*Lock him up*
@ericgarland @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost well why not . If it's corrupt and against the law that's a green light for 45
@SenatorLeahy @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost It seems like there's no consequence to anything Trump does wrong -why?!?
@RealMuckmaker @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost : Trump's entire Presidency is based in corruption. He's a disgrace...
So any guesses on whether @SpeakerRyan, who is attached to Pence, knew Flynn was a foreign agent?  #RussiaGate
- 100% YES! He is in on it all!
@aravosis iokiyar
Impeach Trump. Get this administration out NOW! The whole bunch needs 2 go. Treason.
@DeeTx1953 @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost why is retroactive registration allowed???

#DonaldTrump is proving to be the best investment yet for Russia's destabilization efforts.
why are we played their game? They all lied.
One more ornament hung on the impeachment tree. undermining, compromising national security.
@TinaMorphis @realDonaldTrump in TrumpWorld no diff between government & business. #WhatsGood4GeneralMotorsIsGod4TheUSA!
very true
More eveidence tnat @POTUS and his team are completely untrustworthy and unethical.  It's a Trump first view
Now, exactly 45, what r ur ties 2 Russia? How do u continue 2 deny this? What r u hiding?
B/C Trump had no idea what that meant, what it impacted or that it might be illegal
at what point do the American people  Impeach?
@GenFlynn was NatSec Advisor, foreign agent, & stooge. He's personally responsible for a good portion of @POTUS's job numbers
Always read Ferenhold. He's doing Pulitzer contending work. Classic journalism.
Flynn needs to be in jail along with the whole Trump administration!#resist
- creepy Pencevlnew all about it!  He's a pulpit liar hiding behind his fake religion;Flynn should speak up!!!
Yel, Trump picks not only the best people, he makes the best decisions too!  #trumpkopf
@my2bits4u @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost Trump doesn't care about rules. They NEVER applied to him...before now.
@aravosis @realDonaldTrump is that what extreme vetting looks like?
enough! #ImpeachtheBASTARD
Impeach-took oath to defend & protect #TraitorTrump #Trumpcare
@aravosis @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost   They knew..They lie... They try to deflect anything not going their way.. #Resist
Wtf... "might" is saying he is & just not yet registered. How the hell does GOP get so low & might as well be Russia's lap dog.
Shouldn't this have been flagged during vetting?
@aravosis @realDonaldTrump And it follows that Pence would have known as head of transition.
@aravosis @realDonaldTrump Cuz #YOLO
@wokieleaks1 @realDonaldTrump Trump fired him.
What is crazy is that both of them knew this was WRONG. And still @realDonaldTrump defiantly put this in to play. Reckless.
This president is so inept that he probably didn't know the rules. That or he thinks he can bend them all and get away with it.
Read his letter defending Conway, Trump literally said WH is above ethics laws.
They are all Russian's people in the WH.
What's wrong with that? It's 2017. Everyone is doing it. How long and how much is required to get this going?
So what can we do about it?  How can we as citizens act?  We NEED Trump & Flynn out.
And Pence.
@rezaaslan @realDonaldTrump nah not important not Bigly
Extreme vetting

This is unbelievable! When is something going to be done about this?
Flynn is a disgrace to this country. The White House didn't properly vet him is false. They knew. They all did
@AshleyRParker And @mike_pence says he just found out today? Too many lies.
The Trump team has always been dishonest to the American people. What Flynn told them was concerning. 
Secret Agent Man, Secret Agent Man, You sold out your country, your lying ass got canned!!
F*cktards.  #Traitors
The Trump entourage is a menace & a danger to the United States of America. Period.
.@Fahrenthold @Suzanne1869 @realDonaldTrump The corruption of this administration rises to the level of treason.
@Visionaryck @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost  
Traitors!
Trump and his team thought that was a requirement to be NSA.
Why did he do that? Same reason he made Sessions AG: to have fellow Russian puppets as buffers
"The Unethical Presidency of the United States" Future history book title about you Donnie
.@Fahrenthold .@realDonaldTrump Don - this sounds like you are complicit in his deceit. Lock you up!  Lock you up!
a foreign agent as Nat'l Sec. advisor - the guy who said "lock her up"?
Who is going to hold this administration accountable???
@VP Pence knew about Flynn working for Turkey but lied & said he didn't.  No integrity in this administration.
Sounds impeachable.
@NoahCRothman
The same Turkey that is our NATO allie?   
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
nothing surprises me anymore.
extreme vetting doesn't apply to NSA??? 
@POTUS IS THE MOST PATHOLOGIC LIAR IN THE WH. THIS US REAL NOW!!!
I hate to break it to you, nobody in that camp understood what that meant.
Imteresting how @VP volunteered the answer to a question he was never asked @maddow
The ear-splitting outrage that @GOP woulda had if Obama's NatSec had been a *literal* foreign agent...
Heck, they called him a foreign agent! They have no integrity &are cohorts in treason.
Is any of this actionable yet?
Bannon knows all. Trump knows much. Pence knows some and fears what he doesn't.
They all knew. All of them.Corrupt Liars and Ethics Violators. What has happened to our USA? 
What will it take? WHAT WILL IT TAKE?
@MaxBoot @realDonaldTrump What else don't we know? Ivanka landlord/Rybolovlev/Azerbaijan/Vancouver hotel/Mar-a-Lago mmberships
@Martina @realDonaldTrump Staggering, grotesque incompetence.
More than that, it's malfeasance.
@MaxBoot @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost Without consent of Congress, this was in *direct* violation of the Emoluments Clause.
had he not been caught lying, he would still be National Security Advisor to the US while taking bribes from Turkey
just like previous administrations.
Well, you know - when you've done all the work of TWO jobs, you want two job titles. It's just the way it is. @realDonaldTrump
THEY KNEW AND DIDN'T CARE UNTIL THEY GOT CAUGHT!
They can run but they can not hide
Hmm.. Obama gave Iran Billions of dollars and eased sanctions.. Iran=death to America and Israel & has MRBM's
Now is the time for all WH Staff & Cabinet Members to fess up on foreign agent status. Line up behind Trump
, so spicer either did not tell the truth or maybe he did not get the word about agent Flynn.
WTF
@MaxBoot @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost  its like how Trump said he probably would have been if flynn talked to russia
if he hadnt lied to Pence. So obviously Trump's ethics are not the norm
Turkey is a member of NATO, America has for better or worse a strategic interest in the region. Problem being?
so is "Lie" just an instinctive and reflexive go to for these guys?
We are a rogue nation.  Our leaders belong in prison.
and @VP lied about being ignorant of the entire thing. Lock them all up
Uh Mr Trump, Oops
SWAMP  MONSTERS
So, as head of transition team, the chances that Pence didn't know about Flynn are slim to none
lol reuters just reported the white house knew!  Which is it?
watch rachel maddow she's all over it. #maddowblog
Rachel has been killing it for awhile. She's the best
Of course they did. The rules were made for the common-folk and not for them.
d Not just incompetent, they knew, didn't care and lied about it - 'til press exposed
Remember when Republicans cared about things like this?
only care when it's a strong woman or a black man. Disgusting
Pence was head of transition and was made aware then, yet sort of lied to Americans about Flynn. Why?
Not sort of, outright lied.
Trump doesn't care about rules or laws. Trump cares about Trump. (he also doesn't care about poor people)
