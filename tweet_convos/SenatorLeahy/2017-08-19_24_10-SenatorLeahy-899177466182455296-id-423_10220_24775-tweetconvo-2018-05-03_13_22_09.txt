It's almost like their movement (or it's leader in the White House) doesn't represent the vast majority of Americans...
The leader who LOST the popular vote?
Political language is designed to make LIES sound truthful and murder respectable.

            - George Orwell
Ya think
Bots and fake news suppliers couldn't make it
That clearly shows the left doesn't like freedom and managed to scare people who would have liked to display their opinions
#totalitarism
This is what intimidation looks like: armed militias in Charlottesville.
Who's worst? Don't tell me antifa's got legitimate reasons to destroy public properties?
Who's worst?  Easy question: nazi with guns.
I think fachist communists revolutionary with bats (with nails) and rocks ect. Are pretty much as bad...
Then, you have no moral compass.
So far (damage wise) the "left's" more "passionate groups" reing supreme in property destruction and physical harm
They kill 275 persons.

275 is not enough for you???

Monster.
There can b no greater show of where the convictions of real Americans R than these pictures, #1 Trump&Hate groups- Not wanted, #2 Love Wins
I love this!
Lookin' kinda sparse!
Nice. Looks right.
You do know that 2017 pic was taken hours before the inauguration and had been debunked right? Maybe you don't...
Yup lots of violent left wing Hippocrate showing up to cry when they should get the fuck back to work.
Did you survey the crowd and determine this?
#TrumpResign because your supporters are on the right in both photos. Yes, that right. @realDonaldTrump #TrumpResign is trending
NASCAR races were on, both days
This will piss him off. .. brilliant!
65 million votes for Hillary Clinton vs 62 m for the leader of the Klan
It's still very frightening that there are 62m Klansmen.
Well many Americans didn't really believe it did you? Solidarity from Australia!
I have been telling people for years that the KKK is alive and well and was laughed at. I live in the south, there are a lot of them
That's depressing and scary, but we can fight back!
Please explain how Trump successfully won the presidency w/no Tomfoolery
This is the most woderful Sign of the Apocalypse ever!
Wait...maybe they are being paid to protest.
Or maybe they took the day off.
We have vacation days in US also.
Amazing what you can project with fake film.
Robert George on @msnbc just did a "both sides" finger wag at the dreaded "antifa," i.e. anti-fascists.
Trying to make Antifa a boogeyman. Good luck! Nazis are terrified of them bc they attack Nazis. Antifa isn't all bad in my book. Fuck Nazis.
Walking peacefully better equate to voting.
mmmhhh..... oh yeah..... you're right. yet i can't quite put my finger on it. can you @realDonaldTrump ?? 
Lol
Actual picture from yesterday. This is what democracy looks like!

231,556,000 eligible voters , approximately 25% voted trump .
Yeah maybe because of media people were embarrassed to say that they voted for trump
Trump: 62,979,636 out of 231,556,000  eligible final tally.
We're discussing the present. If you'd like to live in the past, please go alone and leave the rest of us moving forward.
Fake
Small hands draw small crowds.
Um, the top Two are different places
If you can handle Gigapixel - Trump Inauguration Move that picture around for awhile. They lie to you & your country
So your against free speech. Cool.
@realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump @EricTrump @DonaldTrumpJr @FLOTUS bothers me when i type in Melania and up comes @FLOTUS
@realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls now what?! Why didn't u guys pay for some 'statue lovers" to show up?!#statueloversarereal #notfakews
Yeah people need to get off their ass and make it to the polls. Protests and posting it on twitter doesn't do much. #VoteOrDie
According to Trump both look the same lol
Man, Soros is really pulling out all the stops. All those paid protesters must have cost a fortune! /s
Wish @seanspicer would come back so we can get his 'spin' on it!
I have alcohol. Sitting on a bidet ordering pizza. My life is complete.
the difference in the election turn out  though are entitled third party twats
Take this RT. You've earned it.

I love this.
To be fair lol
You're gonna hurt his feelings. And you know then he'll get mad. Don your flak jacket.
Yahtzee!!
Yep.  we the people in Boston.  @POTUS and his imaginary "yuge" crowds at the inauguration.
It is obvious to me that the vast majority of people in the country despise racist hate groups. Why then are the racist hate group in power?
Is it simply a matter of doing away with the electoral college? Is it Russian interference? Is it a lame Democratic Party?
We know we have the numbers. Why do we not have any legislative power? Think FCC and this despicable Sinclair broadcasting
What's going to happen when FCC okays the merger and they're in 72% of the local TV stations? Is it going to help our cause?
We need to start getting smarter about getting governorships and working together to oust the racists & the silent, complicit GOP MOC
The lack of majority support for Trump is real.. not #FakeNews.. photos don't lie
Husband just mentioned the similarities! #GreatMindsThinkAlike
Geography..
yes it's the one that's hired regularly by soros to cause trouble wherever the left wants to. #onthepayrollofatruenazi
Seems very hopeful, but please remember, it takes very few people to hijack a nation's government.....
. maybe our elections are a #BernieMadoff fraud already and blaming Russia is just a last ditch  smokescreen by the ProgenyofKlansman #AMDG
Where was Sean Spicer to report on the Boston crowds? Was Melissa McCarthy not available?
"There are dozens of us. Dozens!"
Truth is a painful experience

Idiotic.
So, basically, Democrats don't have a job to be at during the day and ppl feel their speech is less in danger now than ever?
good jobs have vacation days
Yet somehow, we Democrats continue losing elections. How is that possible?
I was in Boston for a family event this weekend and This made me feel the most hopeful I have since Nov. Thank you, Boston! 
@Thom_Hartmann Feels good? Do it at the polls next year!
Omg! 
There is more Love in this country than hate.


This is how you know cheating happened to get him elected; voter suppression laws made by Rep Govenors, Russia interference.
Omg @realDonaldTrump  is going to go nuclear over this comparison 
If only we'd had this kind of showing on election day...
Typical ratings for @realDonaldTrump ... #LostThePopularVote
Omg priceless
*innocent whistling*
there'd be more people if they had a "free peach" rally.
No, the ones on the right are the largest in history...PERIOD!!!   LOL
...An awesome expression of the American way.  #ABetterDeal in Nov. is another way to express our values.

Maybe it has to do with the antifa terrorist group?
Lol.  Sure does.
@POTUS
Lol
Shadows of the inauguration pic indicate very different times of day that the pics were taken. Pushing an agenda perhaps?
How about that. A bunch of sane people getting together in peace, love, to stand United for our country. What a wonderful union. #resist
@PeebsY0 YEP!
So easy to see that the bigly crowds in the pictures on the right are the yewjist evuh!!
You got that correct!
Another idiot that doesn't know who the real party of racism is. Nothing has changed. LBJ was right.
#Resistance 
@realDonaldTrump Great pic of your inauguration, in case you haven't seen it in a while.

seein' is believin' in the untrump dimension
Telling ain't it?

It sure does !
Based on those pictures Hillary Clinton must have romped home.
She did, she got more votes but for some reason didn't win and now trump keeps firing everyone who looks into it shouting fake news 
Trump's also withholding the evidence that would clear him of the corruption allegations (taxes) making him look guilty right? #ImpeachTrump
It's not possible to reasonably follow trump and think he's an honest person, yet he questions the character of pillars of the community?
Don't kid yourself. We're out there. And we're NOT going anywhere. #MAGA
Wow who knew so many hate free speech! SAD! #sarcasm
Ahh the useful idiots... Conned by #MSM into racial tension, rioting, and general wasting their time protesting against the First Amendment.
ahhh  trump supporters have jobs:)
ahhhh people are followers of the propoganda
Haha. Nicely done.
pictures speek a thousand words.
Rallies and marches are great. But we need to get off our asses and vote or none of it means anything. Take back Congress 2018
They look the same to me #maga
Nicely done, Sir.
Do us a favor and Resign Mr. President!
Only proper response is:  Reality-based caring American's = HUGE!... -based 45 -eaters = tiny & binoculars required.
Perfect!
Well done CBS Boston with "Free Speech" Rally.
They need to be grabbed y their balls and hung by them
A pleasure to RT!
Yep, agreed.  Made that comment on an earlier thread ...
LOVE THIS.....
Me too.  Look at those cowards in the gazebo.  Real tough guys.

Took me a minute
The question is: how can a movement so unpopular have the power to elect a president? Answer: the electoral college.
I am going with lack of participation & supporters.
 #Boston got it right! Isolate #Nazis in the gazebo
@RealJamesWoods #JackPosobiec
seven more years
Absolutely inspired, Mik. Well done!  Now to Denver! #NoTrumpRallies #NoTrumpRallies #NoTrumpRallies #NoTrumpRallies #NoTrumpRallies
Well-played, sir.


Parenthesis should be around rally, not free speech.
Omg! Is -that- why Trump likes Nazi rallies? Because they make his inauguration crowd look yuge? I wouldn't be surprised.
In fairness, are #'s everything? like saying Beyonc√© has more importance than Neil deGrasse Tyson bc she has more followers. #logic
Yet somehow he won an election.  Makes you wonder
No u can't make me believe it,stole yes,cheated yes,not won

Who really "elected" Trump?
Did the american people really elect Trump?
Yup, who really elected Cheeto?
America doesn't really want this nazi lover as potus. Never did! He has been installed on us and must be #kicked out of the WH.
GOP needs every table scrap to win.
Totally!
@realDonaldTrump  you just can't seem to organize your goons .
YES INDEED, IT SURE DOES

HAHAHAHA. #CzarTrump they are making fun of you!
Not really, Soros' intel was off and he overspent his rent-a-mob fund for Boston by 10,000%.  New alt-right tactic.

Turns out that real America hates fascism. Cool.
Love how @CBS LIES. That pavilion was the security HQ, but keep your delusion if you like it.
ARE YOU KIDDING??? About 20 Nazis huddled there 4about half hour, scared shitless! You'd be better off keeping your delusions to yourself!
NOW WE HAVE TO GET THAT CROWD TO A POLLING PRECINCT!!! #BlueWave #FlipFL15
Let @Reince explain THAT! Oh, right, @realDonaldTrump fired the little worm. I have Kelly until Thanksgiving. Anybody else in same pool?
Love Trumps Hate.
Now, now lets not post pix like this...its makes #Trumpy very angry and you know what happens when #Trumpy gets angry...
That's when the real #Trumpy shows himself
So why the fuck didn't these people vote against T***p. Everyone knew who he was. But her emails, BS.
Yes Indeed!!  America Won Today!!  #Resist

@lulu_says2 There does seem to be a pattern
"Nice Gazebo."
(in Russian)
Thank God.
Whole passel of people
Only matters if we all remember to #vote
HATE WILL NEVER WIN @realDonaldTrump
Sure does!. The first pic is probably still haunting the yellow haboob to death. He has horrific nightmares which force him to tweet @ 3 am.
How about this one? https://goo.gl/images/Ai7Y3J 
Ha! If your trying to tick Trump off? You did. Ha! #MuellerIsComing
Who's gonna vote tho
It's almost like the right no longer represents the will of the people.
This pic is worth a thousand words
Since he's emerged from his racist closet, Trump's going to say the "white areas" on 1-20-2017 are actually his fans in their white sheets.
Ha ha !!
This gives me hope. Let's keep going and never get complacent.
Has anyone told Sean Spicer he's needed at the podium to correct our lying eyes?
@Cernovich HAHA
Hmmmm?
His had very few ppl.but wait?how trump get his number mixed up with 2009????
Nah...that's Obamas
Wait...is that trumps inauguration?
LOL!
I thought the same thing @realDonaldTrump
This crowd shit won't leave us during this outrageous presidency
Uh..hummmmmm
Lol

I'll bet someone will be setting off a tweet storm during his 5am dump. 
I think his tweets are the most bizarre when he's in one of his homes, the dictator chic does something to him
Lol
A picture worth a thousand words...#Killemwithkindness, #bostongoeshardforlove

Which one looks more like nazi germany? They had big crowds too...
America is great. Someone tell the #magats . Don't need their help.
Poetic Justice.
What a great point!! 

And, Boston - I you!

Nailed it, Ann Richards. #DumpTrumpMonday! Delete him from Twitter & FB-watch him whine when he loses followers & the attention he feeds on! 
Wait till they have a resignation ceremony. It will be standing room only.


Size does matter!!!!

@realDonaldTrump ..... recognize this?
Well yeah, because Washington DC is occupied mainly by the left. Nothing bizarre here.
http://bit.ly/2u5yJ5o 
#TheResistance LOL. Now your just poking sticks at failed @POTUS . His #inauguration was huge! Biggest crowds ever. Data->Evidence->Logic!
American Values Rule!!!
@realDonaldTrump Hey trump looks like whenever  your involved, it's a EPIC failure! BAH HA HA HA
I My Boston!!!!
