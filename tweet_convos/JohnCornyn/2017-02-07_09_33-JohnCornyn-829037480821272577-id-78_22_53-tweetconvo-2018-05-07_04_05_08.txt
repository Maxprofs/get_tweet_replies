Glad we got a pic. of the moment we gave up on even acting like we obey the law.  Now, Senators buy votes right under r noses.
Time to pick up my Amway Dish Drops at my local middle School.
His boss nominated her. Is this shocking to anyone? Why is the Left in a bunch? Forgot, they wake up that way.
We have confirmation hearings just for this reason - to keep unqualified candidates out. Rs betrayed us all today
Who determines who's unqualified?
ideally objective senators and those willing to listen to their constituents. But that didn't happen here.
Just because you don't agree with the outcome does not mean it was not objective,
I understand that. And just because someone you do agree with it doesn't mean it was.
and just because someone with whom you don't agree doesn't make it not so. Don't curse the rules based on the score.
So what makes you think they were objective? Her less than stellar record in Michigan? Her inability to answer...
@JohnCornyn vote no for sessions
And now our country drops even further in education
50/100 Senate votes to confirm her. Sounds like a failing grade to me....
@JohnCornyn Youre bragging about this? I am ashamed to call you my Senator. I will ensure you dont have that job next time.
@JohnCornyn nice to know your votes can be bought. I'll remember that come your reelection.
@JohnCornyn I hope you're reading replies. You have not listened to your constituents & you have dishonored your office. Shame.
@JohnCornyn It's a disgrace to our nation when people like her get elected over more qualified individuals
Has it crossed anyone's mind that such an unpopular nominee might be problematic?
Time to pick up my Amway Dish Drops at my local middle School.
@JohnCornyn how can you retweet this???? You should be absolutely ASHAMED of yourself
@JohnCornyn it's a sad sad day for our future. Smh.
@JohnCornyn #LetLizSpeak
@JohnCornyn how much money did she pay you to destroy public schools and bring back segregation.
@JohnCornyn how much did #DeVos pay you? You totally ignored your constituents. We won't forget during elections. #devostated
@JohnCornyn walk 1 day in a teacher's shoes. You'd wake up! Abandoned public ed with your vote. Bought/sold
@JohnCornyn shame on you, John! Sell out!
@JohnCornyn sad, sad day.  You all have proven you are for sale
@JohnCornyn You obviously didn't listen to your constituents.  She is unqualified for the job.  I am disgusted by your vote.
@JohnCornyn The countdown to your leaving the Senate began today.
.@CraigCaplan That's not something to cheer about.
This is a very sad day for American education. Educator should be in charge of Department of Education.
@JohnCornyn Good bye to decent edu in Texas.
@JohnCornyn and that makes it a sad milestone Says something about the nom and the Senate hmm which party started it yep Rs '08
@JohnCornyn So sad, Senator, that you voted in favor of her despite overwhelming pleas to vote "no" from your constituents.
@JohnCornyn #ThomasJefferson #GeorgeWashington #Cannabis Sativa the #hemp plant
Historical level of incompetence and corruption of GOP Senators taking money from DeVos family.
@JohnCornyn #Cannabis #Sativa the #Hemp plant many uses many benefits  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Jack_Herer_-_The_Emperor_Wears_No_Clothes.pdf â€¦

@JohnCornyn Shame on you
@JohnCornyn If social media is any indicator, looks like u won't be back after next election. U done screwed ur peeps!
Why do you hate American children? Oh, and this, you might be in danger,girl. (Per 45)
a sad day for the nation's children:(
@JohnCornyn yes historic. Go ahead & rub it in. Only ppl follow u on twitter r like me .
@JohnCornyn kinda sad that it was the nominee of Ed. Sec. that required the VP for 1st time in history to break a tie.
@JohnCornyn @SenTedCruz @BetsyDeVos You have officially lost all my support and respect, Mr. Cornyn.
@JohnCornyn Don't be too proud of what you and your cohorts have done!  Your vote =disgrace for TX & children, we vote u OUT!
Even Applebees requires 3 years in a management position to be a manager at their restaurant. You did a disservice.
@JohnCornyn EMBARRASSING
@JohnCornyn See you at your next town hall, Mr Senator!
Here's hoping that @JohnCornyn is voted out of office in 2020. Whoever opposed him in the GOP primary and general has my vote.
@JohnCornyn what's it like to sell your soul for a DeVos donation?
@JohnCornyn You voted lockstep, or shall we say, "goosestep", with the Trump admin. Be ashamed, be very ashamed.
@JohnCornyn This is not something to be proud of..DeVos is not qualified for this position.
@JohnCornyn you sold out our kids to follow your own political interests. Shame on you! She's a fraud and you know it.
@JohnCornyn Not being heard will only make me louder. The nation spoke and yall didn't listen.  Big mistake.  We'll vote soon.
@JohnCornyn this is not something of which to be proud #unqualified
dissapointing that republican leadership in Senate was not able to deliver majority.
@JohnCornyn Very sad news for our children. Now teaching kids Senator's will unashamedly take $ for votes.
@JohnCornyn shame
@JohnCornyn When's your next Town Hall John? Make sure publicize the date so we can all attend
You were warned not to vote for her. You will not get re-elected.
@JohnCornyn #repubsboughtandpaidfor
Coward
@JohnCornyn U go in lockstep w/Trump & Co. & we will work to unseat you. You just made a big mistake. Yuge. #TheResistance
@JohnCornyn It's a crying shame such an educated guy like Senator Cornyn would have such a serious lapse in judgement.
True. It is obvious all those votes were purchased. Can't wait to vote against him in 2020.
@JohnCornyn Very disappointed in John Cornyn, but not surprised. You only listen to rural Texans. This is ur Alamo.
Honestly, I think he only listens to tinkle of money as he is happily being bought.
Rural Texans didn't want her either. Charter schools will be a disaster for rural areas
@JohnCornyn sad day in America.  Senate ignoring the people and catering to party politics and billionaire pocketbooks.

@JohnCornyn John Cornyn is a disgrace! Spineless party-liner who doesn't care about his constituents. Bye bye in 2020, Johnny
The GOP is despicable! Most  have proved that party matters more than country. SHAME!
Today we witnessed Republicans serve their political donors and not their actual constituents. That appt was paid for.
Agree big time or as Trump puts it "bigly"
Shameful!  Embarrassed for this state and this country!
@JohnCornyn Shame on you for voting for an unqualified billionaire. How much did your vote cost, Senator?
