Additional costs under BRCA:  Losing your job to care for relatives at home, paying out of pocket for essential care.  #ADCA
We aren't buying your shit, Cornyn. Now, go listen to your voicemails, your box is full.
I earn a good income & have great healthcare via my employer.
I don't want tax cuts.
I want my fellow man to have healthcare as good as mine
Not about a party "win". Design a plan that actually benefits Americans. Vote NO!
  Ted Cruz - 202-224-2934
  John Cornyn - 202-224-5922
Not taxed
Thanks for detailing the ways your plan gives back lots of $$$ to the wealthiest among us, it's really calming the fear & panic in steerage
yup it's tough to tax an absence of access!
How about feminine hygiene products?
I predict white riots after Rs pass this bill and dump Millions of middle-class white Grandmothers out of Nursing homes, even their own.
and what is affect/effect on Small Business?  Get "the peoples" input, not CBO's
If you have a cosmetolgist license Cornyn and the Koch Brothers are coming to to take that a way too
Just admit Republicans don't want to help pay for services to the poor, sick or elderly. Be honest. Stop tip toeing around the truth.
I note you do not include the 3.8% investment tax. Will you provide the total amount and the number of people paying this tax?
Tanning salons & Health plan execs salaries
9. Medicare tax on income over $250,000
10. Medicare tax on investment income
11. Taxes on insurance companies' executives salaries
You don't seem to understand that Most who can do so don't mind paying some taxes to help the poor, the sick, and children.
Tax cuts for rich at the expense of health care coverage for poor!  More GOP transfer of wealth from poor to rich.  Just "MEAN"!
Oh, get lost. Your bill is a disaster. The AMA & every major health organization oppose it. It destroys coverage. Minor tax cuts don't help!
Your #wealthcarebill is bad for Texans.
"Does it improve coverage? No. Does it improve affordability? No." -- AMA president. http://spr.ly/60138WLOb  @MorningEdition #HealthcareBill
So defund Planned Parenthood so you could repeal your viagra tax? Explain why guy gets erection aide girl loses Pill and disease screening !
I don't pay taxes on my employer health plan already. My premiums will double. And Aetna is already giving you money for  your vote. GREEDY
Guess what my wealthy clients said about the #ACA taxes? They want to dump the #BCRA
I feel your pain. I just want to take care of my patients. I don't mind paying the taxes. Why should Cornyn? He already got $ from pharma
You really have got to stop polishing this turd.
Texas ranks #3 in US as Home to Most Billionaires #3 Most Insurance Issuers AND  #TEXAS is #TheUninsuredCapital ofTheUSA Gee-I wonder WHY
Tampons?
Millions won't be able to afford them, but good news! They won't be taxed!
But the massive hike in premiums are effectively a tax on citizens.
Mitch an the Koch how much is that check worth
And billions to ur rich donors
Hurry up and pass my goddamn tax cut John. I'm tired of this waiting.
Your Medicare tax repeal is an enormous gift to the wealthy: http://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/house-gop-health-plan-eliminates-two-medicare-taxes-giving-very-large-tax-cuts …
The eyes of Texas are upon you, sir.  And we are taking notes.  #townhall
This is utter lies. The healthcare bill is designed to cut taxes for the rich and gut Medicaid.

Screw your constituents right John!
Seriously what happened to you?
Only your donors & 1% care. Does nothing to help 99% get/stay healthy, nor will it help disabled stay in community. Party of freedom? #ACA
If our plan doesn't cover the vast majority of our health problems, what good will a tax break on medical instruments do us, Johnny?
So. What. Only a Republican could think that cutting taxes is a goal in itself.
Do you even read the responses to your tweets? Nobody thinks your bill is a good idea. You just keep tweeting details that don't matter.
Where is the CBO score?
And all that's good. Except for real people expected to swallow #Republicaresucks
You're an evil man
Here's a view from constituents in Fort Worth. Explain this away will ya?
We are not buying what you're selling.  This death bill is a tax cut built on the backs of children, the disabled & elderly.



Senator what is the value of the retroactive tax cut do you receive?  You, your spouse & "blind" trust benefit from trading heathcare stocks

What does it matter when we won't be able to afford these things when our premiums skyrocket
So repealing taxes and forcing us to pay more, puts more money in the pockets of you and your pimps.  I know how this works.
Most Americans didn't vote for the malevolent Cheeto & yet you're hell bent on doing his dirty work. Selling out your constituents.
In other words, a huge TAX CUT FOR THE RICH.
Why would you lock out someone who is unable to pay for continuous coverage? What good does that do?
Trying to convince yourself that your BCRA  is  better than Obamacare? We - those who are actually affected - aren't buying your it!!
When your loved one is sick and in need of quality healthcare, the LAST thing anyone thinks about is their taxes!
Sure, ignore the fact that the law guts Medicaid, which thousands of seniors and disabled people vitally depend on. Liar. @indivisibleATX
Y'all had 229 days since election results to go through normal drafting process.  Emergency deadline is political fiction you created.
In related news, John is in a massive hurry to eliminate HC for 23m people, raise deductibles and premiums, before the  buffoon goes down.
Not buying it John.  Don't want the ACA, AHCA, BCRA, or any other health related acronyms y'all can come up with.  Repeal and get out!!!
Great. But how will we be able to afford them after paying our premiums that have gone up by 30-60%?
The fact that you see this as a good thing says a lot about where your priorities lie.

It seems fitting that, with the #TrumpCare debate raging, I got this bill in the mail today from Ethan's most recent open heart surgery.
