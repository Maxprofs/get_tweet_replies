Republicans did EVERYTHING they could to undermine and undercut the ACA. They put $$$$ over people every time. #shameonyou
Thanks for all your effort, linking to the relevant data. Too bad the senator won't care enough to actually read it.
No, but hopefully some potential voters will see it and get motivated to #Vote.
Republicans, quit blaming everyone but yourselves. GET TO WORK!
Is this what you're referencing? BTW, WA state resident since 1975.
What does Boeing have to do with Healthcare?
I don't know where you're getting any of that. Anything to back any of that up?
.@JohnCornyn @politico You can't fix ACA w/out mandate, coverage minimums, and community pricing. And protect Medicaid!
In what forum have they been invited to participate?
You can't try to ramrod a bill that affects EVERY AMERICAN save for your rich cronies without encountering resistance. U R MORALLY BANKRUPT
Put the bill up to committee and debate. Be a god damn Senator, stop being a corporate stooge
You have the power to fix the ACA. But you care more about scoring political points. That's why you're an unredeemable partisan hack.
Secret bills forced through in darkness. I expect that from @SpeakerRyan. I expect better from the Senate.

Let me help. Strengthen the individual mandate, absolutely no abatement of any tax imposed by ACA, and expand medicare to all states.
GOP priorities, in order: 1. MONEY 2. Party 3. Big donors 4. Evangelical wacknuts 5. Sticking it to "the left" 6. Money 7. Money 8. Money...
You hide from us.  Thieves in the night, the whole lot of you.
John, seriously?  You cannot lock yourself and @GOP behind closed doors to write #AHCA and then cry that no one outside them helped you #DUH
GOP raged they only had 2 months 2 read ACA bill. McConnell will give entire Senate 10 hours on Trumpcare. The hypocrisy is disgusting.
You aren't even letting the democrats SEE the replacement. Like complaining that you aren't getting help cleaning when you never asked.
Again, the problem is price inflation, something that predates the ACA. How will massive tax cuts / less covered people solve that?
You are assuming the GOP objective is to address healthcare, when really all they want is $800B give back to 1%.
Schumer sent a letter to McConnell asking for open debate-that's what you call obstructionism?
How's that super secret turd of a healthcare bill coming? Care to share any of it with us? Of course not, it's worse than the House's.
@JohnCornyn So 1-19-17 CNN live 45 stated he gave U a lot of $ & get to work. Constituents want to know who do you work for? Career over.
How many democrats have you personally reached out to to help solve healthcare, and who are they?
Pick up your phone phone, John John
Show us the bill!
The way your hiding and covering uo this bill.The Kick back checks must be very large
@JohnCornyn please stop the inane argument that Ds not assisting, there are many Rs' claiming they cannot engage in process.So you are lying
I bet you'd have lots of support if you decided to #fixACA instead: cheaper, easier, more popular w voters.
How are massive tax breaks for the wealthy going to make healthcare better for Texans? @JohnCornyn @tedcruz
It would help if you and the GOP would stop lying and work to make ACA work in the way it was originally written. Single payer.
please explain to me at a Town Hall preferably why democracy is served by secret bills, and refusal to take fed dollars to help the sick ?
Still spewing divisive inflammatory rhetoric, even on Father's Day. You're a class act, John.
The Ds penchant to resuscitate a program that is dying will lead to the death of quality medical care & free-market insurance. #FullRepeal
Perhaps you need to invite others to the planning party.
Hypocrite. GOP has worked to make sure ACA fails, refusing to legislate fixes. Ins Co's leave due to uncertainty. They continue to profit
Help help? Is that a special kind of help? GOP help that we've all been waiting for?
FACTS ON OBAMACARE:
Help? YOU & GOP DUPED AMERICANS! THE TRUTH HURTS!
People who lose their healthcare or any part of it, will not forget who conspired or remained silent when it was taken away.
The GOP has made no effort to bring the Democrats into the conversation.  Transparency may impede your big tax cuts for the rich.
I will invite you to my house.
My house is locked.
You cannot enter.
The party is inside.
Why aren't you at the party?  You were invited!
Maj Whip afraid to have townhall meetings in Texas w/Texans, embraced obstructionism 4 eight years, now complains - utter nonsense!
Show the bill to the @SenateDems! Do not vote on a bill that you have withheld from the minority party!
@GOP had 7 years to work with Democrats to pass &\or improve the ACA. Chose 100% obstruction instead. Now you own its demise. #Hypocrisy

How can you possibly yell obstruction when all Rs have done for 8 yrs is block improvements? Have hearings!!!
You like talking about failing ACA but let's talk about AHCA & how it's DOA
How are they supposed to help? No R will ever vote for changes that might fix the ACA, and you won't let them contribute to your bill.
You comment on her reaction yet what you & your GOP goons are doing is TEN TIMES WORSE! You are ridiculous.
Ridiculous!! We're not distracted-Stop sabotaging the ACA & fund CSRs #ShowUsTheBill #SinglePayer #MedicareForAll
WATCH: @SecPriceMD outraged about passing major health care legislation without adequate transparency. 
#ShowUsTheBill
Here's the side-by-side of the debate process for the ACA & for #Trumpcare. Notice the difference? 
Try to talk...you can play ball together! Why not FIX healthcare
Show the text Senator
Maybe if you let .@PattyMurray in your men only, R only room, that you are using to craft up the healthcare bill she could make improvements
If you pass the AHCA, when people inevitably die, you will be a MURDERER. #SaveACA #FlipTheHouse #FlipTheSenate #GOPHypocrisy #VoteGOPOut
because you and GOP want ACA. It's all on you if it doesn't work bc you are withholding funds.
Sir, you might want to pay attention to the responses to your tweet. 2018 #resist
Today would be a good day for you have a town hall meeting. Who are you afraid of?
Why have you shown the bill to lobbyisst & Big Pharma, but are afraid to let the citizens of the United States see it?
We don't know what's in the bill and they don't know what's in the bill, so how can they help? #hypocrite
What does the AARP think of all your hard work to provide access to healthcare for us Americans that you pray for every Sunday?
Well, enough about the Dems and women.  Tell us what the AMA has to say about your marvelous improvements to access to healthcare.
#ShowUsTheBill shame on you
Oh, for the love of GOD! You wouldn't let women or Dems help!  The hell!  What is this propaganda you're spewing?!
You either need to fire your tweet staffer or consider taking Haldol. What's with this? SHOW US THE BILL. You are the height of hypocrisy.
Cornyn  thinks all of us constituents are just mouth breathers. @charles_gaba already spanked him hard w\#ACA facts. He's just lying now.
Let us see the bill before you go shooting off your party before country mouth.

#SwampOfLiars 
#TheResistance
- WTH with the all MALE squad on Senate version? Y'all do know we're 51% of population, yeah? Is it 2018 yet?
You know Dems might come to the table if y'all were more transparent & not willing to risk the health of 23 million citizens. Oh, #RESIST
Do you send these tweets just to pissed us off, because if you are, it is working!
You own Congress and presidency!! What on earth are you complaining about? That was your official party position for 8 years
Run your month and set on your ass, nothing productive.!!!!!!!
we need to get rid of all congress and senators, please vote people
Not sure what you are trying to say, Senator. Americans need #ACA. @potus & GOP must stop sabotaging it or people *will* die.
In the past Cornyn was ok now seems selling out Americans is a plan
Majority of us are on to GOP lies. Enough to vote y'all out. We know u r sabotaging the ACA
Since the bill the republicans are proposing is secret, like a dictatorship, no one knows what it will do.
Absolutely untrue. Democrats, serving their constituents, stated they are willing to revise, but not replace Obamacare.
Revise not repeal.
Put a zipper on your mouth...can't wait til your seats available!! Until then show us this DEATHCARE bill being hidden!!!
Tell us all about those invitations you sent Dems to get their help. Tell us about your help to save ACA. You are at fault, @JohnCornyn
Loser hypocrite in high heel cowboy boots
Deliberately, maliciously undermined by Republican lack of leadership, direction. #trumpcare kills
Stand up like a man and tell your constituents you're taking up to 24+ million off of ACA and giving trillions to the rich as tax reductions
But what is it? See @voxdotcom Dylan Matthews asks 8 GOP senators how the bill corrects ACA issues. They can't/won't answer.
secret horrible bill will be such a disaster we won't have to worry in the slightest abt R-control for a long time
Why are some men driven to evil?
moronic comment-R's basically flatten all the tires on the car, then point and laugh about how it can't be driven
Grow some cajones and represent your constituents instead of sucking off @SpeakerRyan.  Get off your knees and do your EFFING job.
And when do u plan on having a town hall? Maybe actually ask what your constituents want. Unknow, since your phones dont seem to be working.
You're not going to see help for a darkroom effort to screw millions out of health insurance.  Like rats in a sewer.
#JohnCornyn kills women & children with pre-existing conditions.
#JohnCornyn death squad legacy. John Cornyn kills family healthcare for TX & USA. Vote him out.
@SenTedCruz & #JohnCornyn destroy America's healthcare with @SenateMajLdr AHCA death squad. Vote them out if you live long enough.
Do you agree with Greg's discrimination bill?
You suck, I can't wait until we can get you out. But first...Ted Cruz!! He Gone!! #YouLookLikeaD-BaginCommitteeHearingsFYI
You think people are really going to fall for your empty-headed lies?? @gop had 8 yrs to come up with something better!!
McConnell made TrumpCare partisan - no discussions on the revisions & closed meetings.  How can the Dems help if Rebups aren't open?
And there is this
Per @NoamLevey, McConnells office is refusing meetings with major patient advocacy groups. 

Sometimes a bar graph is worth a thousand words: 

Still no bill. 
Call the Senate switchboard & ask for your Senator. Tell them this bill will hurt people you know & love. (202) 224-3121 https://twitter.com/hillaryclinton/status/874694428438540289 …

In other words, negotiations are nearly wrapped up on what's actually in their bill. What's leaking out is awful. But the bill is secret. 4/


What does this gibberish even mean?
It means the #ACA was well thought out, had plenty of input, and was not passed in secret by 13 Republican men.

No, Obamacare Hasn't Jacked Up Your Company's Insurance Rates
If something has flaws it can be fixed. Unless there is an unending search and destroy mission by people who put #Partyovercountry
You had SEVEN years to make improvements to ACA. Instead, you did what? Hypocrisy knows no bounds with you. You will kill people w your bill
2009 Senate #ACA process:
• 160 hrs of floor debate
• 100+ committee hearings, meetings,etc
• Full amendment process, 171 GOP amdts adopted
GOP senators might not realize it, but not one state supports the replacement health bill http://nyti.ms/2twyVHL 
How are massive tax breaks the  wealthy going to make healthcare better for Texans? @tedcruz #trumpcare
Oh please ,You and the entire GOP set the ACA up to fail for partisan reasons. Don't pretend you care about any of us .
I guess you put the invitation in the mail for the closed sessions that they thought you shut them out of?
Support your @POTUS on the floor! Speak out against subversives like Ryan, Graham & McConnell!
RusskieBot... lol
Da
Hi, John, is the bill written yet? When are the hearings? What is the markup time? What is the amendment period?
what is this gibberish?
#ShowUsTheBill!!!!!!!!!!!!

You don't get to #critique @SenateDems for #obstruction (#Gorsuch anyone?) and NOT make the bill #public
y'all are being the worst #hypocrites on #AHCA! #Obamacare had more hearing than #AHCA and you dare to be #snarky?
Obstruction was your middle name during Obama admin, own it. You and your cronie @realDonaldTrump wrecking #ACA with state #GOP

#LazyNews
Why don't you work on the reversing the 161 amendments the Republicans made to the ACA that weakened it in the first place?
1)Weren't you JUST crowing about how good you are at working with others across the aisle? 2)Shouldn't a senator proofread before tweeting?
Once more for the Senator, in case he missed it.
1)Weren't you JUST crowing about how good you are at working with others across the aisle? 2)Shouldn't a senator proofread before tweeting?
Your bill isn't an effort to fix health insurance problems, it's an effort to cut taxes for corporations and the wealthy.
Give Dems a chance to add amendments to the Senate healthcare bill. Who is obstructing who?
Who cares? The @SenateGOP @GOP could do something about the failing Obamacare but you're too busy playing this fake Russian crap.
They've had 8 years and haven't done a damn thing except sabotage the ACA. #GOPPartyOverCountry
BS! They funded every penny of it and even more for the 6 years of its existence. Stop lying!
Ummm what? ACA isn't failing but Repubs are doing everything they can to destroy it. They've had 7 years to fix it and make it better but no
How can  dema help with something theyre not allowed to see???
SHOW US THE BILL - what is so hard about that?
Repeal is failing?
