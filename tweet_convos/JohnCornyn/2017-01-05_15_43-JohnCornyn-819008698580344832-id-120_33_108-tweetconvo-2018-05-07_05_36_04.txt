lol.
@JohnCornyn @GovernorPerry @ENERGY Very disappointed to hear that,  he's totally unqualified.
You must be kidding? Is it simply because he is Republican? WHY?
.@SenJohnMcCain ... Where do you stand on the completion of ethics reviews for these cabinet picks before confirmation?
he is replacing a person whos degrees he cannot even spell and probably cannot pronounce. #badidea
...never mind...
You've become a joke! Most people can see this BS. WTH does the GOP have on you? More Keating 5 days @GovernorPerry @ENERGY
Why do you think he's a good candidate for this important office?   He seems dull witted and unwise.
. Surely you're joking. Could you go back to having a shred of integrity, just for a moment?
C'mon, Senator! Be the stand up guy we all know you can be.  Fight for a better cabinet.  The future literally depends on it.
You'll support anyone the Russian President Elect likes. You're a rubber stamp. #irrelevant #TraitorMc
Perry is unqualified!! So disappointing. I thought you were one of the reasonable ones.
Perry should be nowhere near Energy like Trump, a madman, shouldn't be in the White House!
please sir explain how this is a great choice
Perry isn't remotely qualified for that job. Your support for him is a disgrace.
I disagree after unconstitution placation of @keystonepipelin . @WaterProtectUs @SenToddYoung
No
@JohnCornyn @GovernorPerry @ENERGY  not a scientist. But he can dance
Please clarify. What did he do for TX in terms of energy? What qualifies him for this position? Just being friends with him isn't enough.
confusing choice but then aren't they all?
Hey, Gov. Perry. What do you think of McCain speaking to misogynist reporters?
FYI: Sexist @observer has now resorted to taking misogynist aim @KellyannePolls alongside cheerleaders @SenJohnMcCain and @LindseyGrahamSC 
Do you think that @GovernorPerry  is the best person for the job? Would you have appointed him to this if you were the responsible #PEOTUS
For everyone commenting, don't forget to call his office, make your voice heard.
They reeled you back in, I see Sen. McCain.
@JohnCornyn @GovernorPerry @ENERGY I wanna chew on your meat face
@JohnCornyn @GovernorPerry @ENERGY iiiiissss he? No Ph.D., said was going to shut it down - as soon as he remembrs its name
@JohnCornyn @GovernorPerry @ENERGY We're all wondering why you'd vote against balancing the budget you traitor...
Have to say I am disappointed in you
What?! This is the man who wanted to eliminate the dept of energy, right?! Why is he a good choice??!
a man who wanted to shut down the agency but couldn't remember it's name ..is a great choice? #eyeroll
JOHN MCCAIN SUCKS!! ASSAD RULES!! THE FSA ISIS SHARIA LAW PEOPLE MUST DIE!!!!!!
You break my heart. I thought you were the voice of reason in the party! We were counting on you!
can rick even utter more than a few sentences about the scientific concept of energy? Doubt it.
Have you forgotten this is department your friend wanted to CUT (as candidate for potus)
are you KIDDING???
Sen McCain, you make me so proud when you stand up for Country over Party, but then this??!!
I love how he spent his spare time from his duties as Governor to obtain a Nuclear Engineering degree!
to be honest you don't make a pimple on Governor Perry's butt you are the worst senator in Washington
US Intel should be ashamed it couldnt find out that outrageous truths about DNC before foreign hackers did it
Never denied by DNC!
You should be thankful to the hackers because they helped to unveil the real threat for USelections, the DNC
You are a traitor if you go with democraps and help them to revoke the elections.
sir, you are one of very few Rs that I trust and respect, but Perry is a goofball.
You have no integrity!  @GovernorPerry wanted to shut down the energy department.  But now he need a job so it's ok?  #GOPBS
Rick Perry is not qualified to talk about nuclear energy.
-two real communists..
don't you remember when he booked entire stadium to Pray for a better economy. We're I crazy and went
You got to be kidding me your smarter than that
So good to FINALLY have a nuclear physicist in this position! #21stCentury
Energy is focused on Nukes and cleanup, he cannot feasibly run this. I know you may like him, but plz block it
are you a maverick or another Trumpkin? Please choose one or the other.
This is the dumbest thing Senator McCain has ever done. Sellout.
while gov perry may have government experience his lack of science background is concerning.
He wanted to end the DOE. Now he runs it. I'm sure it's going to go swimmingly!
really? He wanted to abolish and you want him making decisions on nuclear waste?
What a joke! Replacing a PhD scientist with a Dancing with Stars alum. Tell it like it is.
ah OK. He's your FRIEND. Now at least it makes sense. Disappointing otherwise.
Lol- on his first day inoffice, he may finally remember - this was the Dept I wanted to get rid of @SenJohnMcCain @GovernorPerry @ENERGY
Is he now aware there is an energy dept? Getting a PhD in Nuclear Physics?
You Mr. McCain find your backbone in one minute then cave! Did they get to you?????????????
retire please
have you gone daft?! @GovernorPerry wanted to get rid of @ENERGY - but maybe you couldn't remember it any more than he could.
The Dept. of Oops.
Better back Trump!
No...sorry sir but he is not a good choice. Please rethink your position.
.   LOL
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL!!!!!!!
Hope he remembers which building to go to on 1-21.
Well, I  knew I  wouldn't agree with you on everything, but make the Russian hacking connect w/Trump.
After have 2 PhD's at Energy it will be refreshing to have an idiot. #MakeAmericaStupidAgain #MAGA
You do Approve mostly of Pres.elect Trumps, Cabinet selections, same for others his Administration.
Beliwve me Senator I would never TWEET falsely about you, putting words in your mouth Gov.Rick Perry
Many don't agree. Perry is not right for such job.
Geez @SenJohnMcCain , just when you start to make sense again, you say something insane like that. @GovernorPerry @ENERGY
Really? Perry isn't qualified to head up Jr. League. UR rhetoric fails & so does your administration.
Rick Perry should stay on Dancing with the Stars, dumber than Bush 2.
Could we have less respect for that decision? He's even more ignorant than Trump.
Take a good look at Rex Tillerson. It wouldn't hurt to have someone at state that understands Putin.
- He said he wanted to abolish the dept. he's been chosen 2 lead. How's that a great pick, sir?
So disappointed in you. Perry is the wrong person for the job.
ты же ебнутый на всю голову спасибо вьетконгу.
Really?  Cause I am pretty sure my undergrad degree in chemistry tops his science credentials.
what happened to you, when you stop standing up for the least of us #disappointed #veteran
(Note: It's A Pro-Russian Cabinet) Ted Cruz: Trump’s Cabinet Conservative ‘All (cont) http://tl.gd/nnat28 
he got a D in meats
he wants to gut it...wth?
When did this idiot earn a physics PHD? The @ENERGY dept is about nuclear energy and weapons, not oil and gas.
are we all mad?.did you ask him what was that third department he wanted to close ?
ugh!
But McCain you are a HRC shill and you need to get on the Trump wagon. You betrayed us in Vietnam.
wish McCain never was elected u r a war monger
Awww. Just when you had started making sense.
