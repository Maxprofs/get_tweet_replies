Yes, such power. A Medicaid funding cut - yes, John, it's a fucking cut - just in time for the boomers to start requiring nursing home care
The only power u give @NatlGovsAssoc & @NCSLorg members is to determine who & what services to cut. Start with nursing home or cancer care?
He does not care about his reelection in 2020. He is already 65. He is only concerned about $. His legacy and history will tell the man.
His office says he hasn't decided if he's running in 2020 yet. Too far away. Wonder if he's holding off on fundraising too?
John's ego has grown past his capabilities. Whether he runs or not depends on where the most $ is. He could be indicted and jail Trumpgate.
When states allow abuse, it's the Feds who protect our civil rights. 10 essential Health Benefits Protect the People. You do not!
Bankrupting states is not a "devolution of federal power."  It's an abuse of power.
And how do you reconcile that with the DOZENS of pieces from the WSJ eviscerating the BCRA, John?
Let's be honest - it's about change/unknown! So we imagine or latch onto sugg logical conseq & see them as real. And miss a gd change.
Look at @JohnCornyn using his big brain to sound smart. #NoAHCA
Not sure why we need a booster shot to weaken the entity that 'united' the United States, going to cost a lot more to wall off each state...
Again how is #BCRA #Trumpcare #Wealthcare better?? #VoteNO
It would make it harder for seniors and people with disabilities to get care in their homes and communities: http://bit.ly/2toAScQ  
States shouldn't have to go begging to Federal Govt for waiver. Health care is not a federal responsibility. States should have 100% control
Federalism is indeed devolution--i.e. a step backward, not forward.
So the bottom line for you is reducing the federal government at ANY cost, including citizens' lives.
So I'm supposed to trust that the great State of Texas is going to take care of us better?
By all means, @johncornyn, keeps shouting #statesrights. The Texas Legislature has totally got this. @IndvsbleTXLege
Healthcare and insurance scale very, very well.  Why hamstring policy by limiting that scale to the state level?
Then don't expect my tax dollars come April 15th.
A sentence that doesn't actually have any positive evaluation. Senator when is your #TownHall during recess? We need a talk on #healthcare
I like how you ask people for their twitter handle in your new poll on healthcare on your site. Trying to drum up supporters on here lol
Sneaky.
Here you go states that cannot afford it. You're welcome. #FederalistLoveTrain
Hey the WSJ is pointing out your buddy Trump colluded with the Russians how do you feel about that?
& really what's a few thousand ppl left dead for that accomplishment? Cuz that will happen too. Ppl will die without care but hey tax breaks

Why don't you just admit you don't think the government has a role in healthcare. You know Texas won't pick up the slack. #Trumpcare kills.
What makes you believe state's will do a better job.
You're letting your terrible ideology motivate a monstrously heartless, downright criminal act.
What about the 22 million? Explain your view in #townhall. #townhalldodger Kids already lost Medicaid coverage in Texas #WhyDontYouCare
Good, now you can resign! Let Abbott take care of the 400families, of which several live in Texas. Let the Medicaid people die as Ucelebrate
My healthcare should not depend on which of these United States I live in.
If you care about giving power to the states, you can use your recess from DC to come speak to us here in the state at a town hall.
What a magnificent gift to the rich this would be!
The WSJ did not say this --- good article. Both views
Hey John, if I can get 100 Texans to donate $100 each to your campaign fund, would you have a town hall meeting with us?
Let it go John ....we don't want your stinking healthcare!! Fix the ACA
It's too bad that the Gov of Texas has no interest in taking care of its children, veterans,sick or poor.Texans will be hurt by this plan.
This is all a word play; ACA is the foundation for all HC plans!! Fix ACA , stabilize insurance Markets,reduce drug prices and move on...
How do you feel about the big government request for all voter information from all states?
BCRA= Bull Crap Republican Act
Cornyn.  Tx just had $350 mill cut in Medicaid!! Ur flowery words on BCRA -meaningless.  22 mil ppl w/out ins; premiums worse then  ACA.
Y'all would love the same healthcare results as The Great State of Texas, right? Highest infant mortality rate in the country! Thx Senator!
The states cant afford GOP plan! Another loss for the american people!
#RepealandReplaceCongress
The thought of Abbott, Patrick, and TX Rs having more power of healthcare is absolutely terrifying.
And the things we are most frustrated with are usually ran by state governments not federal.
That doesn't help TEXAS!
Oh, so now some states will be wastelands of bad healthcare rules (red states) and some will be amazing? It's bad enough as it is.
With Texas rejecting Medicaid expansion funds, we have a maternal death rate in line with undeveloped countries. With BCRA, it would worsen.
Do you even care about your constituents? 
http://m.mysanantonio.com/news/texas/article/Texas-Medicaid-cuts-leave-special-needs-kids-11253074.php …
Exactly! BCRA would deal a huge blow to the disability community. You should be ashamed of yourself @JohnCornyn This bill is dispicable 
Is this abt healthcare or ideology?
I think we all know.
Bless your heart.
Who needs such a "devolution" when the BCRA is the greatest mistake this country will ever make? Less federal power is not a goal in itself.
Yes. THIS is what everyone is talking about. NOT. Your ignorant POTUS' twitter habit is @GOP biggest problem. 
Great if you're not living in Texas - which refuses to finance health or ed or food or housing because it might accidentally help the poor.
That is what we want, but does #BCRA deliver?
Pls #RESIGN.U should publicly denounce the president's offensive tweets.Leaders should not remain silent, take a lesson from the ex-Ford CEO
Maybe we should send u some old leadership books? You need em.. talk to constituents in person NOW #stopahca do not take away our healthcare
We see you.  We are your employer, not the President not the GOP.
I've seen my state's Lege at work. Our state of Texas is pathetic when it comes to healthcare policy.
If u only had the courage to speak to your constituents and do what is right, guess thats a Hollywood fantasy,  too bad youre such a coward
That is not a selling point to actual Americans who need health care. Your agenda hurts real people & your indifference to it is sad.
And the state I live in will fuc* everyone.....look what Abbott, Patrick, Paxton et al are doing now! This does NOT give me the warm fuzzies
Kill the BCRA! The eyes of Texas are upon you, Senator! #NoCutsToMedicaid #ResistTrumpcare
John we can see right through you, stop trying to trick your constituents. DO NOT vote for #AHCA  bill.  Grow a pair and stand up to Trump
#turntexasblue
Your bill makes things worse. http://www.npr.org/2017/06/30/534756511/senate-bill-leaves-key-problems-with-health-care-system-unresolved?utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=politics&utm_medium=social&utm_term=nprnews …
Why are you not listening to 80%+ of the people though? We don't want your wealth transfer to the rich. #DeathCare #TownHall
How does a tax cut for the wealthy improve healthcare for Texans? How does cutting healthcare help our Texas economy? #worstsenatorintheUS
Why not talk to YOUR constituents and see what they think?  Or do they no longer matter to you? #turntexasblue

Key word devolution.  We could be monkeys
2. Federalism can be balance against partisan freakshows like the State of Texas GOP's far-right Christian old white men.
Been warned Kris Kobach and the VP are getting the voter rolls in every state with your personall info and SS They have no right to this
1. The power that reside in states like Texas does not reflect the will of the people but the effectiveness of @GOP gerrymandering.
You say that like it's a good thing.
Good then we wont need you
Why are you asking people to donate money for you to do your job.  No one wants ACA repealed except you and insurance.  

I get what you're saying, but if you looked into our state budget, you would know we need help. This bill doesn't help Texans.
No to the Senate HC bill and still no response re POTUS tweets.  You are complicit. You lost both my support and respect
Each means parts of the country get screwed over more than others!
Every single one of you @ people better vote if he is your MoC. Vote vote vote him out out out.
Nonsense, yet again from Maj Whip.
Where is your townhall schedule 2 meet w/Texans in Texas 4 your performance review? Failing grade so far.
I think it's way past time you denounce Trump's behavior.
Like i said earlier, townhall meeting in Waco July 5 at 10a.m. work for you? We'll talk then about your plan. #TrumpcareSucks
Or, it could set our healthcare outcomes back for years to come. How is a heart attack different in Dallas then in Memphis?
#NoBRCA
Still kicks another 22 million off insurance. Still a terrible idea.
Coincidentally one of the largest wealth transfers to the richest 1% in a while too. Way to dress it up though John!
"Devolution of power to the states" is a very interesting euphemism for "tax cut for the wealthy." Haven't heard that one before.
WSJ also just published a story about how Russian hackers were trying to get HRC's email transmitted to Mike Flynn.
- So people in AZ might live longer & have better HC than people in AL & that's a good thing? No. Single payer = way forward
What does the Main Street Journal have to say? That's where I live, my family lives, and my friends live. Perhaps you should visit sometime
The biggest Koch Brother talking point Send every thing to the states Showing you work for the Koch Brothers not us
Just stop!  Is Ideology more important than citizens lives?  Have a townhall this weekend & talk to us in TX!
Not good for Texans. TX opted out of Medicaid expansion - Not a good argument.
Yeah, and the result is millions more people unable to afford health insurance. Oh, and a tax cut for the super wealthy. #priorities
Wall Street is the enemy!! Unlike you I can't afford stocks & investment portfolios. If only I had millions I might care more about WSJ.
I oppose bcra
Any town halls? I will be in The Valley, Corpus, ATX, Houston between today and 7/5. If there's one let us know.
Repeal #Obamacare like you have promised for 7 yrs. It can't be fixed.
dude give it up= start saving your moola. gonna have work/ after 2020.
ride'm cowboy.
Not the solution needed-doesn't address central issue of rising healthcare costs or make it affordable for lower and middle classes.
GOP ideas re healthcare promote economic inequality between rich and poor. We need to grow middle class unless you want a 3rd world country
@JohnCornyn  .isn't that the plan trump has and you, his LOYAL follower blindly follow him
The eyes of history are on you, Sir.  As well as the eyes of Texas.  You should be ashamed.
You don't know who Sang 'neon moon' or 'tops drop'
Bait-and-switch. So obvious. Can't talk about offshoring funds in tax "reform" nor the fact US cits aren't guaranteed ACCESS to healthcare.
Shall we talk about how "presidential" the president is or his collusion w/ Putin?
83% of Americans don't want your tax cut, John. Do not want. What part of that is so hard for you to understand?
If you have women in your life please go and look at them and see how you would feel if the President disrespected them.
he does and two daughters======all workin for trump on your dime.
This is why he kisses Trump's butt!
Murferers
You tweet this like it's a good thing. TX didn't do Medicaid buy in, thousands would lose their hc & die. You are shameless. #TurnTXBlue
Wow how deep! Have you had your breakfast yet?

This is wild. The tax cuts 400 families get from the BCRA equals the Medicaid expansion for 700,000+ people. https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/26/15862002/tax-cuts-ahca-republican-health-plan …
