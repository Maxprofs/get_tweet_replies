What are you thoughts about @realDonaldTrump attacks on Judge Robarts? Is delegitimizing the judiciary ok with you?
If you continue to follow Trump & Bannon, you do so at your own peril.  We will not forget!
Funny how @JohnCornyn never shares any of the news articles that "DEMOLISH" his position (or the GOP's, or Trump's). Quit being a shill
I support @POTUS 100% We Texans need u to Support him Also and his Travel Restrictions no more Illegal Immagrants !!!
*immigrants
VOTE NO BETSY DEVOS!! Are you listening???!#sell out our country
I can't wait until the next election, I'm from Texas, and I can promise you that I will be out in the streets
I'm constituent & can't reach by phone. You must #DumpDevos & Vote NO on #DeVosvote
Respect your constituents. Vote NO on De Vos nomination.
hilarious- article makes 1 unsupported claim and the rest is filler. Guess what-Texans read!
Still been trying to get in touch with your office about NO to Betsy DeVos. I'm a lifelong Texan who cares about Texas kids.
Believe @potus will win but aint good brief @DHSgov need only say Carter banned Iranians EO 12172 Bttr cases too
so you support DeVos? Why?
How about the EO is unconstitutional?  How about answering our calls to #NoDevos? #DraintheSwamp #Kochgoons
@SenateGOP @SenateDems  #VoteNoDevos @senate She is NOT qualified!!
Here is your answer
Full video of our Democratic forum on Trump's Muslim/refugee ban is available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8FybkxrcMM&feature=youtu.be …
ugh the president who's been in office a month and has NO political experience. Yes I bet Robart does know more
Don't be on the wrong side of history.  Stand against the ban and DeVos.  Your demo is changing, and you will lose the seat.
nobody wants you anymore @JohnCornyn
Haha. Let us know when banning people based on their religion is constitutional, Senator.
Maybe if this ban was implemented with more deliberation, judges wouldn't have to make snap judgements.
You continuously make poor choices and embarrass our state. I can't wait until you are defeated in 2018
so rump is right! all 3branches of gov't.R so political(self-interested),US citizens need to scrap system&start over
HogSnot
I saw the video.  He gave several, concise, specific examples of his basis.
your #45 needs a sanity check, a Russia check, and a constitution check. And this is what concerns you? Sad...
smoke screen and mirrors. You Tweet about nothing your constituents call your office about...
HEY SIR! I have been trying repeatedly to contact you using every method available to beg you to #dumpdevos
Haha in your wildest dreams
@sassysassyred @dcexaminer "immigration is important driver in WA." The state's lawyers argued $MSFT employs  5,000 Slaves.
Establishment loves cheap ass labor... $AMZN $MSFT $GOOG etc..
When did THAT happen?  The EO is still stayed.  Do you trade in disinformation purposefully?  Country or party?
. John, you're a lawyer. Have you even read the other side's brief. No? Didn't think so.
the ever eternal game of 1 up-man-ship; meanwhile we taxpayers/voters keep on paying (& voting)
In 40yrs 20/3.25mil refugees convicted terrorism 3 Americans killed by Cuban refugees in70s
you are TERRIBLE ADVERTISEMENT for #GOP and #CHRISTIANS  ashamed of you. Go down fighting for what is right #coward
So you're opposed to checks and balances?
I'll bet Trump's SCOTUS choice would disagree with you and this thinking. Checks & balances.
I believe the judge is attempting to de-ligitimize our President. I wish congress could step in and correct this.  @dcexaminer
too bad an appeals court didn't agree
No, just no. Xenophobia is not American value. Town hall now. Texans want to chat #TX21Indivisible #standindivisible
john,  Dodds frank?
Just to be clear, this is the same Justice Dept that argued against judging the case based on facts? #NoBanNoWall
the examiner is politically biased and disreputable news source. As DJT says, "you're fake news!"
we live with a balance of power so uneducated sociopaths that crave attention and power cannot abuse it
I thought the Republicans were the strict constitutionalists. Don't ever try to call yourself that again.
hypocrites to the core.  Bloody shame.
I am a constituent. You have betrayed Texas. Trump is no conservative. Stand up to Trump.
I am also a constituent, and I am glad Trump wants to protect our borders. This judge is putting us in danger.
I had faith in congress f not POTUS. No more! Texas Dems will rise up & destroy you all. We have learned our lesson!
publication is partisan schlock. "Perhaps Robart has received the POTUS daily briefing." Well we no POTUS doesn't!
"demolishes "? Clickbait much? #doyourjob #devosisunqualified
.@JohnCornyn @dcexaminer Weird that the appeal didn't make it then hmmmmmm.    Get on the right side before it's too late John. #NoWallNoBan
RTing bad arguments hurts your (and GOP's) credibility.
you are quoting Byron York a partisan hack this is the best you can do
Reporters don't make decisions for the Court. You need to do your job & protect the country from an incompetent Cabinet.
haha nice try amateurs
...are we serious with this? This is what you consider reputable? No wonder we're fucked..
johnnie, johnnie, johnnie sticking w @potus vomit @realDonaldTrump might hurt your career. Vote no to devos.#impeach
You have time to tweet 4 times this morning, but not answer your phones. Please say no to DeVos!! #noDevos #resist #NoBanNoWall
why are you supporting something in direct conflict with Constitution and American values?
no on DeVos.
Well written & very informative. The American people need to be educated.
Not something to be proud of. Constitution, separation of powers, judicial branch? Republicans endorse tyranny.
district court does not have standing in a federal immigration law case.
Appeals court's quick denial of government request doesn't bode well for their arguments. Need to make stronger case
IDK. Government's case seemed weak: Trump is president. He can do what he wants. Arguments were immediately rejected
Checks and balances be damned. How do you call yourself a Republican. I want my party back?
Wow!  Texas senator shits on the separation of powers and embraces executive overreach.
I thought you guys had ethics and actually gave a shit about the rule of law.  Nice to see your true colors, I guess 
Also, thanks for the argument against voting for your SCOTUS pick. It's abundantly clear u care nothing for the law of the land
