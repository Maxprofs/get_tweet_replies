And the @SenateGOP is led by the Irony Turtle himself. Glass houses, GOP, glass houses...
@SenSchumer
RP House complained couldn't do much because the Maj Senate were DM & http://Pres.Now  Congress maj are RP and still can't pass bill
Poor Chuck. It must have been very painful to have that hair piece hand -stitched to his scalp. Gives me a shiver.
you guys obstructed our nominee.
Mitch McConnell & @SenateGOP are such blatant hypocrites. You should be ashamed of yourselves. You kept an open Senate seat since FEBRUARY.
"Justice denied for Merrick Garland & the American people." http://www.politicususa.com/2016/12/04/justice-denied-merrick-garland-american-people.html … #SCOTUS #resist
boo hoo
Like the @GOP did to Garland  For every action there is an equal & opposite reaction.
U.S. Government Ethics, Accountability, Transparency, Integrity, & TRUTH on life support. [2017] 
 He's not wrong. Ur comparison is irrelevant. This is a stolen seat. GOP chose party over country & refuse to share
Garland should have been given the same as what Rep's want for their pick. Fair is Fair and they were not.
NOT-If you believed that, then the GOP would have at least HEARD the nominess of the last President.Few decisions tie
@HouseGOP Republicans r a bunch of dishonest lying politicians for 7 yrs screamed Repeal n Replace! and what happened at the end

Hmmmm Merrick Garland.....
It's a horrible truth that a schmuck like @SenSchumer is a better LEADER than all the @SenateGOP put together combined. Learn how to lead!!

I can't listen to the #RussianSaladDressing coming out of @realdonaldtrump 's mouth anymore. #obstructionofjustice #russiagate @DevinNunes 
If this isn't the pot calling the kettle black 
Yes, you GOP jerks - we've needed 9 since last February. #STOLEN seat #SCOTUSnominee
trump is underhanded and is under FBI investigation why should  we trust any decisions he makes
.@SenateGOP @JohnCornyn You can dish it out but can't take it. You can obstruct but not govern.

I'm sorry...you forfeited the obstruction argument a long time ago. It looks like you are also forfeiting the moral and ethics argument too.
The minute that Committee changed rules without Dems, they went rogue IMO - remove em
plan 2 retain control & continue 2 divide avg Americans. We WILL NOT all b billionaires
You realize, of course, the real Resistance was fighting against foreign occupation.
But you're arguing for it.
YOU obstructed and didn't even know Judge Garland! Not a single hearing! Hope this blows up in your slimy faces!!!!
Do you know why DP passed many bill when majority of Congress were DP because they work as a team & not for personal agenda? Team work.
Devin Nunes is a Trump clown. Dump him. Get independent Investigation. Trump USSR/Ukraine/international torts
The top lawman in the land lies to your face and no one has the balls to do anything
We DEFINITELY need 9. Install M. Garland immediately or be forever judged by history as corrupt.
Schumer is an assclown and you all are letting him run wild over you - totally disgusted with the GOP right now

IS RUSSIA BLACKMAILING #DonaldTrump?

DEMAND AN INDEPENDENT BIPARTISAN COMMISSION!…
@badgirl_loony @SenateGOP @SenSchumer anything for money & power is part of #Republicanvalues including racism, sexism, treason
Was it Obama's values that murdered Gaddafi in Libya and turned a fairly prosperous country into a terrorist training ground?
. So pence has a little talk with you & everything is fine. Look whats going on around you & our country!
Fascists is all he needs to know. Russian spy in the White House too
. A word on the ACA. Americans deserve the same Healthcare that we taxpayers pay for REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS TO HAVE.
The ONLY PROPER nominee for that seat is Garland. Otherwise,  remain vacant a MINIMUM of 239 days frm DT's nomination
.@SenateGOP @JohnCornyn @SenSchumer wow, almost like these are related! #WhatHappenedToGarland #OhRight
@JohnCornyn @SenSchumer 2016 Feb: your 9th was provided. Your entire party obstructed.
At least he fights for what he wants. More than I can say for all of you.
@JohnCornyn The GOP hypocrisy could choke a buffalo.
@DonaldTrumpFrankly;Trump's Immigration Ban should pass. Immigrants can't #PAY for ObamaCare! Help make government strong by Ban

So you’re saying he’s come around to GOP’s way of thinking? #stolenappointment
@SenateGOP @SenSchumer @JohnCornyn
2016: @SenSchumer said #WeNeedNine #SCOTUS justices.

@JohnCornyn @SenSchumer and Merrick Garland? #hypocrisy
@JohnCornyn @SenSchumer kinda like repubs and Garland! U fools r really something else! U wrote this playbook! Live w it!
@JohnCornyn 

@SenSchumer is a Dem #Destructionist on everything except bigger & bigger central government @FoxNews @FoxBusiness
@JohnCornyn @SenSchumer I don't know him either. Is Gorsuch a GOP Justice or Dem Justice? You brought it up, John.
@JohnCornyn @SenSchumer careful senator Cornyn, your hypocrisy is showing. Again.
@JohnCornyn @SenSchumer Same thing the GOP did with Merick Garland--not even a hearing. And Obama wasn't under FBI investigation
He knows the nominee and he knows he needs to please his leftist friends. #Illogical
@JohnCornyn @SenSchumer No SCOTUS confirmation until #Trumprussia independent investigation!
My god do you not see the extreme hypocrisy in what you are saying? Did you know Garland? Did we not need nine a year ago?
chuck Schumer should be impeached. For running his personal agenda working Obama instead the American people.
you are sent to office to do what WE want not what You want don't screw up the vote pass him . power of the people !
.@SenateGOP - @SenSchumer's vote is irrelevant. #ConfirmGorsuch to #SCOTUS using the #NuclearOption. cc: @SenateMajLdr  - #tcot
Qute acting like our President and do your jobs.
Good for Schumer! Dems, remember what they did to Gsrland!  Screw Gorsuch and the GOP! Obama rules!
Of course he is cuz @SenSchumer ONLY CARES about rebelling & winning for @dnc They DON'T CARE about us nobodies...THE PEOPLE!
No nomination while this administration is under investigation for collusion with the Russian government.  GOP obstructed with less cause.
We the people insist that there be a full independent investigation into the Trump/Russia collusion & conflicts of interests.
America is watching how you vote on healthcare, will you be allowed back next November, we will see. Vote no - save you position
Ah really sounds like he is taking a lesson from McConnell book.  What comes around goes around.

(MEGA-THREAD) The plot to sell America's foreign policy for foreign oil _and_ steal an election in the bargain began at the Mayflower Hotel. 
NO on Gorsuch! How can we TRUST that Gorsuch isn't a Putin choice? NO VOTE until Russian ties are investigated!
GOP vote No to Trumpcare if you do GOP members that vote NO will be kept in office.
You obstructed Merrick Garland and now you're whining.  SCOTUS is not and never was your choice to pick.
Garland
Schumer should be Fired / Amer People nd to vote him out- he's been there too long & is making a joke of the process!

#drop the Byrd rule
If the Senate does not invoke the nuclear option, I will never donate another dime, and will start voting 3rd party.
Born to Obstruct! voted for him in 2006 oh but this is diff.
Chuckee is showing signs of insanity.  Hate will do that to a person.
ALL the @SenateGOP voted to let internet providers share our web browsing history without permission. Please share.

Didn't give Merrick Garland a hearing. You have no morals! YOUR candidate is UNDER FBI investigation.  Crooks! cc @SenSchumer
You ABSOLUTE hypocrites, Faux News won't cover you forever, #weseeyou
just like you did for 8 years Guess that slipped your mind
PASS THE HEALTHCARE REPLACEMENT.
GOP go nuclear if need be, this partisan politics is clearly just that. Gorsuch is highly qualified moreso thenother
Pretty hilarious characterizing the dems as hypocritical given your behavior the last nine years. No hearing for almost a year is only one x
Please use the Nuclear Option to confirm Gorsuch. THIS CLOWN SCHUMER is extremist biased violent corrupt & radical
You never interviewed Merrick Garland so didn't know him.Hypocrites. @potus is under investigation!#stopscotushearing
GOP Congress snub of Garland/Obama was outrageous. Trump does not deserve a lifetime appointment. #ETHICS
You obstructed for 8 years. You obstructed the nomination of Merrick Garland.  Sorry, no pity.
It's time to vote all Republicans out of office. We need human beings not killers in the name of "freedom".  BE HUMAN

what is it like having short term memory? You just did the same thing last year.
#fakepresident #impeach #TREASON we will remember all names who stands with this traitor . Trump is hurting us
Imagine that...standing up for a stolen seat.
AIPAC pumped $120 million into dems and reps pockets in  ten years. We r tired of $10 million/day Israel while we starve. We are watching.
@SenateDems NO confirmation of ANYjustice with Pres/admin under FBI investigation. We've gotten by fine w/8 for a yr.
Are all Republicans cold hearted? Time to do what's right for America and remove trump from office #TrumpIsACrook
We will vote in Nov 2018.  We will remember who votes for this horrible bill!  45 doesn't have long in office.  Vote 4 what is rt
Stolen appointment by subject of an FBI investigation? Schumer is right. You guys were OK w/ 8 for a yr. Hypocrites!
- @SenSchumer is obstructionist and full of hate; he really needs to be impeached. His level of hatred needs to be "examined."
Perhaps you remember #MerrickGarland
Your party is over. #Trumprussia
#EightIsEnough until #Trumprussia is put to rest. We do not give lifetime SCOTUS seats to Russian puppets.
Do yourself a favor and vote against bootleg Ryancare! Voting for this bill could cost your seat as well!
Merrick Garland? Stop the #GorsuchHearing now! Trump may be out soon! Not right for a #traitor to appoint a Supreme.
heck the Republicans are the ones that show the Democrats how to obstruct

grow a pair... back our potus
Clown Schumer time to step down!
they should obstruct.  He's not good enough
Um, you mean literally exactly like y'all did in 2016?
is aware that you guys stole this seat. So are we.
Kinda like ya'll did on Obama's nomination? #goodforthegoose
Actually, we should have had a Judge confirmed last August. GOP are 100% hypocrisy, 0% integrity.
We have a SCOTUS nominee from Obama. Hold hearings for him! Explain the lies in this RNC ad to the people! @SenateGOP @SenSchumer
Odd how the Russian trolls never bother me when I post on THIS PAGE! ;)

MURDER IN MISSOURI BY POLICE COVERED UP BY FBI
pro politicians like Schumer are anti for the sake of anti and should be made irrelevant, the country comes first
The judge has a track record of flat out siding against citizens in favor of corporations. #BlocktheNomination
Shumck Schumer-What a piece of hypocritical cow dung--Wait till 2018-DEMS lose again. They are despicable!
