Sir, you're in the Senate intelligence committee and you dish propaganda. If you have facts for the Am Citizen, share. YOU are complicit.
This isn't new...
Well, congratulations are in order, I guess. You got Putin's boy in office, you & Mitch hushed up the hack until after the election.
I'm sure you're not surprised since 45 seems to love him some Russia. Stop enabling 45 & Russia love. Pick #CountryOverParty #BeAPatriot
Senator, your thoughts are....?
Was Trump making a speech?
Are you tweeting this because you think it's a good thing? How many in the GOP are Russian sympathizers?
This is the Russia story you tweet about this week? Why the silence on the election collusion & interference?
Do you even read the comments people leave you? DO YOU EVEN CARE. Jesus Christ, you're such a troll. The @gop must go ....
and what are you going to do do about it? Clearly you are aligned with a corrupt POTUS.
Happy? Every time you harped on HRC's emails while covering up Trump's treason, you supported this. Man up & own it.
GET BEHIND CRUZ/LEE, DO SOMETHING TO EARN THE MONEY YOU ARE PAID! TEXANS PUT YOU THERE WE CAN VOTE YOU OUT,REMEMBER THAT!!!
We know, it's called @FoxNews & @GOP
