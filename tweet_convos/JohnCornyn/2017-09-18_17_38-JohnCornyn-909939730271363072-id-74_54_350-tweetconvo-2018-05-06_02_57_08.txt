A wonderful and moving series so far that makes me think of my Gramps (A vet) :)
Is it available online anywhere? Does anyone know? I really want to watch but don't have tv.
And Lynn Novick. Ken Burns and Lynn Novick. Both tremendous filmmakers.
To be fair, Burns is the more well known name. I pointed it out because I nearly made a similar mistake upon meeting Ms. Novick a while back
How do you find the time to take healthcare away from 33 million Americans, and watch a Ken Burns documentary about Vietnam?
Gee...and i thought you were helping texans recovery from Harvey. If you like any Twitter porn tonight, blame a staffer.
Ken Burns' documentaries are like impotent old white man porn so, close enough.
While watching keep in mind the parallel of Afghanistan!
Started watching but all I saw was North Vietnam propaganda glorifying Ho Chi Minh.
Where are going to get programs like this if funds to PBS and the arts are cut?

Our @will_c_fischer says #GrahamCassidy is just #TrumpCare with a new name and still takes health care away from thousands of #veterans. 
Maybe you should think about the vets that will lose coverage because of #GrahamCassidy

Shocking that you don't think of it as liberal propaganda "rewriting" history.
You sure do hate our veterans when they challenge you John. Remember when you demanded your opponents records?
But then you took deferments during Vietnam, didn't you?
I finally understood why we're drawn in the quagmire. Thank you PBS, Ken Burns & Lynn Novick.
While we're reassessing American foreign policy. Does anyone think Kissinger's move toward China- resulting in China's rise- was wise?
Vote no on #GrahamCassidyBill.
Anything Ken Burns produced i watch, WWII, Civil War, New York, now Vietnam. Fantastic !!
Is this in between the time you're spending taking away healthcare from sick children?
As you literally steal from those that fought.
#GrahamCassidy cuts #Medicaid. 1,750,000 veterans covered by Medicaid. A vote for #GrahamCassidy is a vote to take healthcare from veterans.
We the people want that wall to be built that is why we voted for President  Trump so stop lying that we don't want the  wall to be built
. @Spotify teamed up w/modern artists to cover iconic Vietnam-era songs @thelumineers
Watched it too. Great show. Now, do right by our vets and vote no!
1,750,000 veterans are on #medicaid. If you support veterans, support regular order & bipartisan healthcare fixes. #SaveMedicaid @votevets

Something we can agree on.
Thousands of Vietnam vets will lose medicaid with Graham-Cassidy. Horrible for our children, elderly & disabled. So cruel. Please vote no.

Maybe you can learn something about hubris in foreign policy from this show & avoid it
Simply amazing
Are you reflecting on how profoundly disrespectful it was of @realDonaldTrump to suggest that his sex life was his own Vietnam War?
Nebi, you are too trivial to watch this documentary and engage in any resulting discourse. Cartoon Network is more your level.
It is riveting! Another @ken burns masterpiece
Dumbest tweet of the week! You really think were interested in what you're doing on Sunday night? Repeal and replace grandpa cornyn!
Starts in Britain on BBC Four on Monday, with the first two episodes; looking forward to it #KenBurns
There goes Cornyn again. Trying to get us to pay attention to something else while his party and our healthcare face real threats.
The US government allowed Soviets to become nuclear thru espionage & let China fall to communism. There were communists in  Govt!
Just did....got them recorded since my husband fell asleep.
If US hadn't lost China- no Korea, no Vietnam. No North Korean problem now. I wish our leaders were wiser. Communists were in  government!
So sad and avoidable. It's sad how inept American hegemony has been. Communism is a scourge & we should have never lost China.
While conspiring to gut healthcare for vets and their families? Nice!
Save ACA.
TX voter here. Any chance you're considering voting against #GrahamCassidyBill? It'd be a lot cooler if you were.
And your proposed healthcare reform will take much away from many of the same veterans will that be your crowning achievement John?
It's very painful to watch. We had no business there or in Iraq or in Afghanistan. So many young men & innocent people killed for nothing.
History revisited Dominoe theory of Communism "How many nations today call themselves Communist?" (5)
Too many.
I take it you're a fan and will defend PBS budget? http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_597f5819e4b0da64e87ad2ae/amp …
John Cronyn = Vietnam Draft Dodger
Figured you would be reading up on the Graham Cassidy bill you fucking moron. Or answering constituents emails from your gov website....
aargh!  i forgot to tape that.
This is amazing for those of us who's parents served in Vietnam. My father did and I'm understanding why he never really talked about much.
Yes, it's very good!  Helps us all understand why it happened.
We are also! Great documentary!
VOTE NO ON THE ACA REPEAL
After approving $700B military budget. What kind of sick joke is this?
My dad enlisted at 18 & served 2 tours in Vietnam. He passed 10 years ago. He'd be alive if his PTSD was treated. Enjoy your show.
Hey! SUPPORT THE DREAM ACT.
Thanks for the tip! I just switched over.
Watched the first episode today and cannot wait for the next. #KenBurnsvietnam
Are you also watching your President implode?
Gayle you are such a hateful person

I asked people to share what it's like to live in a country with universal health care. The responses that came in were incredible. 
Stanley Karnow's was much better, if less hyped -- and 33 years ago.
@PBS
Didn't watch Karnow's till yrs later. Aired to soon after the MemorialWall.To soon, just 7-8 years aftr the humiliation
We'll see if as good
