@JohnCornyn @SenateMajLdr @FoxNews the US Legislature failed Americans. Do your job!

You can't offer "relief" when you have absolutely no alternative or replacement plan to enact, you partisan hack.
.@fxnopinion @JohnCornyn @SenateMajLdr McConnell is allowed opinions, 20mil insured is a fact ACA is working, but needs fixing
Americans want a replacement first. Don't hurt people #ACA @BrookingsInst
YOU LIE! #HandsOffACA
relief? By taking insurance away from 20 million Americans? It's life or death for them. Shame on you!!
#ProtectOurCare
GOP has NO PLAN and NO memory before ACA. High costs, $ caps, ppl med bankrupt #GOPnomemorynoplan
Why not do some work instead of bashing @POTUS?  You have votes.  It is hard to actually make things work, eh?
@JohnCornyn @SenateMajLdr @FoxNews What your replacement Senator?  You are putting millions in jeopardy!
how so? Absolutely not. What GOP will replace it with is "common man, pay for it yourself"!
@JohnCornyn @SenateMajLdr @FoxNews No repeal w/o a plan *in place*. U had 8 years, came up with nothing. My family will suffer.
The GOP has failed Americans. Keep your hands off my #Obamacare! #SaveTheACA
ACA does not dictate increased costs and withdrawing from markets.   There is collusion.
- you mean is time to get relief to your coffer by getting richer on the back of poor American. 
Repealing ACA will result in the deaths of 22,000 people a year who would not have died otherwise.
You are failing your party and your country #NoEthicsNoHearing
ObamaCare hasn't failed Americans. You need to listen to all the Americans who are alive due to ObamaCare
It hasn't failed Americans. ACA is improving peoples health. The health ins cos are all you care abt
We are still waiting to hear your plan. Show us the PLAN!
No, you and the #GOP failed Americans. #Obamacare #GOPFail

YOUR FAILING AMERICANS

Just repeal it. Let the States make their own systems. Texas does what it wants, California does what it wants...
@CoxLanham71 why has it taken you so long to acknowledge that which all America knew?  Empty suit!
How are you coming with the replacement plan?
You Sir have failed Americans for way too many years.

Fox News has failed the American People. Shut down your station!!! That would MAGA

#Hypocrite #Traitor #Scum
That's why the #GOP says no to #ethics review of #Trump cabinet picks.
you telling people to grow up is rich.
No, McConnell, YOU failed and continue to fail America!
Does relief include more, better, cheaper care for all? What's in the plan you've worked SIX YEARS on? #LetsSeeIt
Now is the time to restore the power of the health insurance industry and relieve millions of their coverage!
Mitch doesn't like obstruction now? He must be demented
We need to "grow up" and stop asking for the same full ethics investigations you previously demanded? FU
i think this guy is one of biggest jerk in American politics. Another option might b some medical condn.
The gate is near open, but watch for trip wires.  You break it, you own it.
try telling the truth for once. ACA is in need of fixes not repeal. Go after the insurance companies!
Republicans-Make America Sick Again!
It only failed the Republicans in Congress, who cannot take credit for a Republican idea....btw..where is the replacement you have promised?
RESIST

GOP: Stall and GOP will fall. Repeal it this year. Get it done. Do something for a change, GOP!
Damn straight it's time for relief. Medicare for ALL.
no! It helped my patients and saved lives. You @SenateMajLdr failed American ppl by obstruction-shame
It didn't fail Americans. You just want the money to cut billionaire's taxes.
You had seven years to come up with a plan or fix this but you have nothing. You are a failed congress.
How will you replace it? You've had 8 years to figure it out.
But it's socialism.  Failure doesn't matter.
Whatcha got?
Everything Obama did http://failed.Now  liberal's are feeling HarryReid's nuclear option come back to roost.
Better plan for any replacement,,,study the problems so as not to repeat@realDonaldTrump @mike_pence
