"It's unfortunate that health care has become such a polarizing and partisan issue," says John Cornyn.
Once again, a former Texas AG, bringing shame and opprobrium to our state and nation. May I have a taste of the tears of a clown?
Hey John, how can you sleep at night knowing your GOP bill will leave so many worse off? Anything for those tax cuts for the rich, I guess.
Where were all these people dying on the side of the road before the tran wreck that is the ACA? I don't remember that, and I was there.
People get sick regardless of the law. Emergency rooms still stick the taxpayer with the bill, ACA was a first stab at cleaning that mess.
ACA is a crap box designed to saddle the healthy with paying for the sick at gunpoint. Costs continue to rise a d outcomes continue to fall.
That's how all insurance works spreading the risk,car,house,life,etc.
You're correct, but it must work like that with consentual freedom of Association!!!!!!! Otherwise it's slavery literally.
It's outrageous to compair with slavery.That is crazy.
You are saying you're entitled to the labor of others without their consent. How else do you define slavery? I'm curious. Please share.
But to hell with the women, because boobs.  If he hadn't allowed his masters to poison everyone no one would be sick.  #MedicareForAll Mofo!
CBO 18 million lose insurance next year and double that by 2026.  Explain that on judgement day.  You cannot fool God.
All that staff work for naught. Perhaps starting with an honest health care bill would help, @JohnCornyn.
What about 23 mill ppl that won't have coverage? Maybe they can get addicted to opioids and get coverage that way??
FIX THE ACA
So Trumpcare is going to end drug overdoses? Hey John, your constituents are seeking #FullRepeal
He's not a good senator.
Clearly he has risen through the ranks to become the second most powerful R senator. He's good at senating, but really bad at humaning.
Yes, but he ignores how if bill had been approved, kids on medicaid would lose it and die. He wants death to kids and seniors
Charlie's parents want to leave socialized medicine for America but not one of you lefties realize this? Not so bright are you?
would've been less surprised if @JohnCornyn brought a "but her emails" chart
WHERE EXACTLY is $45 BILLION going? Problem is doctors over prescribing! How does that cost $45 BILLION?
Bring all the charts you want-it's still a piece of junk #ADAPTandRESIST  #KillTheBill
OMG! Republican's are being ridiculous... Just work with the Democrats to FIX ACA NOW!!!  There is so much that IS working with the ACA now
Opiod epidemic is serious issue but O'Care/Trumpcare aren't the answers. Get the #FullRepeal & get rid of lobbyist donors & Cong. investors!
Larry OB care has failed America! The ones CBO are touting are FORCED by law and subsidized by ME! Give it up!
I guess your chart strategy wasn't successful.
What the matter john??? You've been awful quiet on your bill. Not going so well? Or are you too busy winning? Lol. GOP = failure
Senator, respectfully - the American people want to keep the ACA (overwhelmingly) its time for everyone to work together to fix what we have
DO NOT REPEAL OBAMACARE!!  YOU SURELY WILL KILL MILLIONS OF TEXANS AND OTHERS THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTRY!!

@JohnCornyn
 
DOH!!!!
Tragic couldn't pass a "Christian bill" that takes away healthcare from millions to replace a bill by a Muslim that helped millions.
Didn't work though, did it?  Worst whip ever
Sorry you didn't get to take away health insurance from poor people but I hope you enjoyed your rosemary-grilled rib eye.

How cynical is @JohnCornyn and the @GOP? This much: How Republicans underestimated Obamacare repeal http://politi.co/2twUrvA  via @politico
Which group is he going to kick off of Medicaid to pay for it? Disabled? Children? Women?
Guess the dog and pony show failed to convince anyone. Now if you said the $45 billion was coming from the drug co. that started the problem
Guess you need to come up with a Schrodinger bill that is simultaneously vile enough for Paul and Lee and also merciful enough for Moran.
 That is a good one! 
To bad @JohnCornyn didn't bring his charts to a #Townhall
Keep UR visual aids or give them 2 UR sugar mama @BetsyDeVosED bcause we aren't buying UR "get richer" scheme.
Senator, The gang of 13's arrogance and disdain for Americans with the secret and rushed Healthcare Bill has come to roost tonight! 4 say no
TAKE IT TO THE TRASH CORNYN.  GAME OVER ON THAT ONE!
So glad to see #deathcare is dying. Of course no thanks to you or especially @SenTedCruz for trying to push it thru
So 
Much 
Winning....

Bwaaahahahaaa. Down in flames goes your death bill. #youhadsevenyears
What about the number of Americans killed by guns every year?
Does his chart show how their $45 billion is negated by the roughly $200 billion in opioid funding they're cutting from Medicaid?
As with so much of this bill, even the things that seem good are actually a step backward

How's your "Trumpcare" dinner at the Whitehouse tonight?  I hope you choked on your Ragout when you heard the news
How was dinner?  Did you get 2 scoops?
Cornyn is a political whore. He's a traitor who has chosen party and power over country. Zero character. Zero integrity.
It's not enough...stop bragging.
See in the chart HIV related dead? Under trump care pp will not be able to buy insurance or pay for D COST OF EXPENSIVE MEDS . Dead sentence
or the chart that shows just how the AMA, dr's, AHA, AARP, pretty much any entity that serves the public oppose it?
or the chart describing the preexisting cap? Or the chart that describes the junk insurance that would be sold?
where was the chart that showed those who would lose their insurance? Or chart that showed the huge tax break for 1%
Guess that didn't work.
So Texas gets a sweetener. & Alaska gets a sweetener. & Ohio gets a sweetener. Why not pass something to help ALL Americans?
Neat chart, John. Too bad you can't whip your way out of a wet paper bag. You don't even have the votes to proceed.
Can't quite read it.  Does red line represent deaths if bill passes?
Congratulations on your trip to kinkos
But we need $200billion too actually tackle the problem. Man, blind loyalty will ole #SnowflakeCornyn his job!
Did he bring out another chart to illustrate his dramatic rise in partisan hackery over the past year?
@JoeNBC @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @GOP@RepKevinBrady @POTUS @realDonaldTrump   Senator, thankfully your sales and leadership skills were mediocre
Your monstrous healthcare bill is dead, Senator Cornyn.
That statement is unclear. For opioids as in to promote them, or for opioids as in to address the problem they have become?

.@SenatorCollins to @ThisWeekABC: GOP health care bill "would make sweeping and deep cuts in the Medicaid program." http://abcn.ws/2tfyJkR  
what effect will the $45 billion dollars have on what I'm assuming is the projected 52,404 people that will die of drug overdose?
I mean those are variables you are showing, but you need to show that they are in some way connected as well
so what does that $45 billion dollars buy us?
Not much. Not much at all. It's a drop in the bucket.

Police Chief Probst (Star City): Medicaid cuts will force West Virginians to wait for opioid treatment. “That’s not going to help anybody” 
Your lies didn't work.
Dead Trumpcare..like a fish wrapped in newspaper.
Is that extra $45B coming from #Medicaid, John? You're a disgrace to #Texas! #VoteOutCornyn #Vote2020 #VoteNoOnTrumpcare #VoteNoBCRA
Perhaps if government got out of the way and let doctors treat patients the problem wouldn't be such a big deal
Did no one tell you the bill is dead John? 
We want hearings while you're waiting for Senator McCain. Thanks.
Don't buy it! There opioids care comes through not allowing it to come in through the wall. This is Wall money, not Healthcare!
-Sweeten the deal w $ for opiod addiction, still leaving the poor, the elderly, our children vulnerable to junk insurance, death, bankruptcy
I assume it was for treatment, not for opioids, right?
Funding "for opioids" or opioid addiction treatment?
What about the number of people of people's HIV that will progress to AIDS if they are unable to afford drugs?
Maybe the pharmaceutical companies who caused this epidemic of addiction should pitch in to help those whom they have harmed. Just a thought
What's he getting in return for the cheerleading?
The GOP will award him the spirit stick. His constituents will award him the title of #worstsenator.
Great, now take that and fix the ACA!
@JohnCornyn 
Could we get gun deaths on there?
