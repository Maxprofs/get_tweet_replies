In a break with precedent, Trump's transition staff is denying extensions to Obama envoys past Inauguration Day http://nyti.ms/2ikCPyA 
Obama did exact same thing in 2008: http://tinyurl.com/jor9w6z 
No. Those were the political appointees, not the career diplomats.
Not sure what you mean. Trump and Obama both fired political appointees.
Read the NYC article. Only Trump recalled the career people who AREN'T the political appointees.
The State Dept link is also clear on that point. Read it.
no extensions. "A little unusual." As in it never happened before. And most do not seek extensions, certainly not long ones.
Sure, that was never in question. No question of "recalling" career diplomats as you said.
You are right.
Yes, many embassies without ambassadors for MONTH is the "way it works" in Trumpland; you guys are in over yr heads.
. That must be why Trump is a billionaire & you are not. Suck it up buttercup!
Why is he not releasing taxes? Because he is a #thousandaire who owes big money.
and probably in HUGE debt to both the Chinese and Russians.
@nytimes Hey Sean baby it's just that at every single opportunity your boss just has to behave like a dick.
@nytimes Typical jerk move by the Trump team.
@nytimes just driving division w/false narratives. Obama 2008. Same. Define "unprecedented"?http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2008/12/obama-gives-political-ambassad.html …
We're looking forward to President Trump's Administration & of course there will be a house cleaning- there always is
@JasonMillerinDC @StateDept @nytimes Let's have Jason talk affair everytime he complains about media. Sad so sad. Scandals
Thank you for exercising the wisdom to exorcise our government of all these horrifically anti-American losers.
. Vote the idiots out of office
Common knowledge except to liberals who live in their own reality.
@nytimes = #fakenews
Give 'em the boot!
They get it; just not looking forward to having to join the private work force & be put to the "real" test! #GOP3
@nytimes Did Obama?d/n think so Oh forgot it is only wrong when Republicans do it? Oh yeah!Pull up urlittle boy pants
@nytimes 
It's called "Draining the swamp"
@JasonMillerinDC @StateDept Fair enough.  The Trump Administration is a Right To Work employer. I'm still interested.
@JasonMillerinDC @StateDept @nytimes Seriously?  Unprecedented?  How about Obama did the same in '08!
http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2008/12/obama-gives-political-ambassad.html …
. CHECK your SPELLING NYT
Thank God that's the way it works! If it didn't, we'd be stuck with the swamp forever! Y'all doing a GREAT job!
Obama did the same.. bunch of cry babies... http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2008/12/obama-gives-political-ambassad.html …
@JasonMillerinDC @StateDept the American people know what's going on The sore losers the cry babies & poor White House groupies
@DMashak @goburch Yup.
@nytpolitics Inventing controversy for GOP & ignoring controversy for Democrats. http://tinyurl.com/zpc2dp8 
@nytimes but thoughtful POTUS's delayed for the family sake in some cases I guys u guys don't care about family's
@JasonMillerinDC @StateDept @nytimes lies lies you are telling more lies. Obama kicked everyone out and it's precedent. Move on!
@nytimes They are embarrassingly inept. Does Caroline Kennedy even speak Japanese??
An Mr. Spicer there are reviews and exceptions are made. Very fools move. But then you do work for a fool.
@nytime this after trump didn't know he had to fill the West wing. You people are idiots.
FIRE them all. WE AGREE!
@LindaSuhler . PE Trump has to drain the swamp before we can #MAGA
@LindaSuhler @StateDept @nytimes and who can blame president trump I don't want them representing me
@nytimes That's one way to say it. Sean, you know it's a symbolic way to show Trump Admin is about tearing down BAU
DTS!!!!!
@JasonMillerinDC @StateDept @nytimes So what? Nobody cares about the outgoing admin and their lackeys. Get em outa there! #MAGA
Why blame Trump?! BHO has done nothing but undermine him. Get over it NYT, time 2 say goodbye 2 BHO
there is no precedent..NYT just needs readers
@nytimes Awesome move!! Get rid of the trash
you know what if anything bad happens you and Trump own it.
The perfect liar like @KellyannePolls She is the perfect diabolic liar !!
@JasonMillerinDC @StateDept @nytimes Obama did the same and so did bush
@JohnCornyn @StateDept @nytimes Says the person that has no family such as kids in schools over seas in the game. Shameful!!
Think they should have locked the offices Dec 17. Especially Lynch's.
THANK YOU FOR DRAINING THE SWAMP. THIS IS ENCOURAGING!
As an Air Force dependent, we moved a lot, without regard to personal inconvenience, it was expected.
@nytimes make sure your appointees are worthy not pay for play. Oh wait you are given spots to big donors.
@nytimes The failing @nytimes does it again.#FailBigTime
@JasonMillerinDC  Defending the indefensible...past protocol...letting children finish the school year. Boneheads...
We do not need them past that day.  O needs to get over himself.
@nytimes BO did the exact same thing #LyingFailingNYT's
@aduanebrown @StateDept thank god for that
@Rockprincess818 @StateDept @nytimes the NYTimes reads like the Mean Girls "Burn Book" against @realDonaldTrump. Embarrassing.
i tried to give u mf a chance. Instead u have cont. 2 scare the shit outta me. Y cant u jus build on the progress and help all.
this is some dangerous shit here. 2 leave the post without a man while celebrating a dumb ass victory here
Draining the swamp already!!!  Go, DJT and Team!!
You expect to leave...you don't expect mass deportations around the world.
@nytimes No - it's a dick move.
You'd think they'd be happy they don't have to work for "Hitler"
@JohnCornyn @StateDept @nytimes Not if it breaks precedent. Americans traveling abroad not having protections during interim.
They shouldn't! Bunch of morons need to leave asap
Good. Get rid of everything and anyone assoc. With Obama. Good riddance.
@nytimes unless you're are liberal media organization hoping political appointees can stay to undermine new President
@nytimes obama did the same to Bush's people. @nytimes you are a joke anyone with sense knows your "fake news" 
Sean, it's the @nytimes. We expect lies from them, right?
Need new blood in Norway? Let me know.
Another fake news story from newyorktimes
@JasonMillerinDC @StateDept  This is the way it works w/every election..NYTimes you start BS at every turn..thats why your faili
@JasonMillerinDC @nytimes political appointees should expect nothing less. Career diplomats are a diff thing. Such a non-story.
especially when you paid for said appointment
@MsNanae5 @StateDept @nytimes. they should unionize, call Sharpton, and be disobedient to civil authority. Is that partisan?
@JasonMillerinDC @StateDept @nytimes When you kill a snake you cut off its head the system has been infiltrated with snakes
@nytimes Just more discourtesy from a boorish president.
New York Times fake news "In Break with Precedent, Obama Envoys are Denied Extensions..."
Did you actually read the article? "Without exception" is unprecedented.
@nytimes When u have no plan, you don't fire experience...
@nytimes Didn't Obama do this same thing with Bush appointees? Why is it ok he does it but it's not with Trump?
@nytimes the ny times is a fuckin joke
@nytimes http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/01/06/no-trumps-dismissal-obamas-ambassadors-not-unprecedented-crisis/ …
Sean  Don't even Justify answering these pinheads.  Go #MAGA   Congrats
And a 1st Lady is supposed to move to the White House with her husband. That's how it works. What about the children?
Missing the point, it's about giving a little time to resettle.  Treat others as you want to be treated.
Precedent? Obama did the same thing when he came into office. NYT needs a historian on staff.
We elected Trump for HIS ideas and HIS choices in staffing. We have had enough of Obama/his staff.
keep up the great work by the way!
didn't the BHO admin do the same thing? I don't see the big deal with this. Why would we ever want someone like a Powers 2 stay
Some of these ppl have school kids. And it would leave the US without envoys in critical Nations for months! WTG!
@nytimes  Wait, they expected special treatment remember. That's the swamp! Draining it is fun to watch!
So U R ok w/ DonTheCon NOT moving his son out of school mid-year but not the StateDept parents? Cold SOBs.
U and DonTheCon will be leaving some countries w/out ambassadors for even one day is reprehensible.
- In surprise announcement, @realDonaldTrump announces that Obama's term and administration is coming to an end.
Does Obama know that?
He heard rumor from cia but considered it fake news.
He believes his rien never ends
@nytimes NYT is so dishonest & lacks integrity; hateful libs criticize/complain abt what MIGHT happen. Hateful & dumb
it is time to stop listening to the irrelevant liberal media. Use our common sense. Don't be cattle. Herd the libs.
love they're trying to make us feel sorry for ambassadors who earn a ton of money... should've been planning for this
we know Obama's administration is far too ethical for your liking.
Did they find the 5 million from the State Dept, that went missing, Just asking?
fake news story by Trump proven numerous times. Get out of your bubble.
please the Video Tape caused Benghazi? Who's living in a bubble?
what are you going to do with yourself now that your Hillary crutches are gone. So sad.
Hillary will be the star,of all the investigations that are going to take place.
delusional Trump played you. He doesn't care about Hillary he even said so.
@nytimes continue to deny and not succumb to pressure it's time to #MAGA and all appointees of this admin must go
send them all packing.
@nytimes Why do u keep giving NYT et al publicity? Who cares what they write? They are nothing but bullsh*t.
could not agree more!!
@nytimes more #fakespin false #medianarrative 

You are doing a great job Sean - looking forward to watching today
absolutely,court jesters are ususally always fun to watch it's their job to make people laugh
Yes! #media has been doing that 4 yrs
