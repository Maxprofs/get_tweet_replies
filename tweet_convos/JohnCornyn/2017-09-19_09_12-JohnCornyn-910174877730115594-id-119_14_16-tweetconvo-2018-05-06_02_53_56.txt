To replace without knowing coat from CBO is irresponsible. Allowing states to waive preexisting is disingenuous!
Repeal and open the free market!
Voters want an ACA fix, not this warmed-over Trumpcare nonsense. Your excitement at the prospect of taking care from millions is noted.
more talk, no action, the legacy of gop congress.
GOPs have to kill Obamacare to give each of top 1% $80,000/yr tax cuts. GOP  slashes social programs - http://abcn.ws/2tmfJky    via @ABC
Senator, Why is not in Health and Human Services versus the Finance Conmittee.  Not a health issue? Senate will have your coverage right ?
VOTE NO!!!
Don't you think south Texas is suffering enough? Now, you want to strip away heathcare for millions? Vote NO!
You have tried over and over to get rid of the ACA. Stop!!!!
Overhaul is NOT A FULL REPEAL!!!! Get rid of the blood sucking program and all the pork with it.
What pork?  My co pay is 30%.
And your increased taxes to fund the program for others is also part of the spend. There are $s going to all kind of programs. Read the ACA!
Hmm, we increase our military budget to kill people and gut healtcare spending. While also gutting State Dept.
Had no problem approving 700 Billion to defense spending (more than Trump asked for).  This is what too much testosterone in gov gets
A terrible idea that will rob thousands of your own constituents of affordable healthcare. We all know the score John...you don't care.
The AMA says #GrahamCassidyBill is a train wreck.
To #Congress: Graham-Cassidy would result in millions losing coverage, destabilize insurance markets, decrease access to affordable care. 
WHY ARE YOU FORCING THIS BILL THROUGH WHEN WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IT WILL COST OR WHO WILL BE CUT OUT OF HEALTHCARE.
NO OVERHAUL.  End it! Repeal ACA!  Get out of health care. Unconstitutional.  Congress should stick to tariffs and excise taxes>period.
@leonardkl You guys do this and the unhappiness unleashed will make the past 9 months seem like a party.
Repair the aca.  Don't mess with angry texans.
Senator, the majority of Americans DO NOT support this bill, nor do the majority of Texans. Stop the sneak attacks!!!!! Listen to us!!!!!
I live in Texas and if you pass this Republicare bill i will lose my insurance along with my husband! Dont kill your people!!!!!!
Preexisting conditions not covered and caps back in place equals death even if you have your crappy policy. Put people over party.
DECISION FOR SENATORS.  does this Graham/Cassidy H/C bill, deliver the H/C VALUE, YOUR VOTERS ARE LOOKING FOR  ?
Sham hearing and an insult to regular order. Shame on you & your leadership. #SaveOurCare
...and your vote won't be influenced by the $180,050 donation you received from Big Pharma, right?
Repeal Obamacare and open the free market.  No government healthcare.
What a disgrace you are.
Do you hate all of your constituents, or just the poor ones
How about expand Under 65 Medicare to cover pre exist conditions and return Hlth Ins industry back to pre O-Care? Solved!
The bill is bad for Texans.
#fullrepeal ONLy!

How many minutes will you allow for discussion?  30, 40 min?
This bill is the cruelest to Americans yet. If you care you'll vote no on the #graham cassidy bill
I called your office and left a message: do not vote yes on this without CBO score and hearings. In fact, just vote no. Keep Obamacare.
Repeal Bank of Dept of Education and return student loan industry back to capitalism instead of socialism.
I'm gonna just leave this right here for the #worstsenatorinusa.
As my Senator, you have lengthy documented statements in favor of waiting for full CBO scores & review b4 voting. Healthcare deserves same
You are an embarrassment to Texas!!!
I want a bipartisan process to come up with a bill that actually provides good health coverage. #GrahamCasiddy will harm me and millions.
Are you serious?!  If you vote yes for this, I hope and pray you will be out of work forever!
Work in a bipartisan way to make the ACA better. You work for us!
How can you stand behind & #support #GrahamCassidyBill??
Under this bill, pregnancy will cost you an extra 17K. Metastatic cancer 172K. Autism 5K. Asthma 4K. This isn't a healthcare bill.
Vote for this bill, you are signing death warrant for millions of elderly, sick, and poor. You do that, you're no Christian. You're death.
There are 90 seconds of debate left after the last vote on repeal in July. Are you going to allow all 90 seconds or just a fraction of that?
Let me fix that for you: "We need to bankrupt or bury millions of Americans ASAP. BTW, I'm pro-life."
You must know that letting Texas regulators determine who gets med $ will be a disaster. We have more uninsured than any other states now.
Why do you hate Texans?
Senate bill 1804 will fix the PP&ACA.

Give it a chance. Read the bill.
This is not what we want. You'll continue to hear from me.
Hold townhalls in Texas B4 voting on an election-busting fraud. Oh, forgot you were an 8 year obstructionist.  Impeach 45 now.
Are you deaf? For the 4th time: NO. Return to regular order & do this in bipartisan way.
#whataboutrussia
No CBO score. No real hearings. No respect for the process or democracy. Again: you come for our care, in 2020 we're coming for yours.
https://www.facebook.com/funnyordie/videos/10155418799453851/ …
Vote NO!  Texans need health insurance.  This is a human and moral war, Mr. Cornyn.
Did I miss the town hall?
Overhaul?  Not repeal?  Is there a difference?  How about taking your time this time?  Maybe bipartisan?
We want universal healthcare like civilized countries have.
Again?....
This is about corporations and not people. And no, corporations are not people. Better figure that out before 2020. #Resist #noGrahamCassidy
Vote no. -
PLEASE DONT DO THIS.
You're just faking going through actual process.
Get er done 
This is more of the same! Vote NO!
This Houstonian says no.
Why aren't you tweeting about the fqked healthcare bill you're going to vote yes on?
You're so desperate to get anything accomplished you're willing to screw millions of people out of healthcare.  How pathetic is the GOP.
Call it an overhaul instead of repeal....   smart...  in an evil villain kind way.
Abolish Obama Care & go to Open Market Heath insurance like before Obamacare Destroyed health insurance for Americans.

please a bipartisan improvement of ACA. From an over 50 with pre existing condition with kid with pre existing condition.
Will a CBO score for this monstrosity be one of your considerations?

Trumpcare 2.0 doesn't solve a single healthcare problem. It merely transfers wealth from blue states to red states.
Why are you trying so hard to kill your TX constituents? Oh yeah...GREED!!! GOP = DEATH. You don't get to use the term "Pro Life" anymore.
Do your job. Work with Dems to repair the ACA.
Terrible public policy and appalling procedure, just like before. Is this the GOP brand?
What the hell is wring with y'all? Do u set out to hurt people or is it that u just don't give a damn as long as businesses make more money.
Y'all need to state that REP leaders feel that access to healthcare is NOT A right.
Why do you continue to beat this dead horse to put millions off of health care & premiums? Fix, don't destroy, make it better. #RESIST
Stop trying to rush through garbage legislation that harms Americans just to appease your donors
Don't repeal Obamacare.
Why do you want people suffering, going bankrupt, b/c their bodies didn't win the health lottery, Senator? What's your beef with the ill?

Under #GrahamCassidy, Americans with preexisting conditions could see their premiums and deductibles skyrocket: https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/news/2017/09/18/439091/graham-cassidy-aca-repeal-bill-cause-huge-premium-increases-people-pre-existing-conditions/ … 
Any vote you cast to cut healthcare for millions will neither be forgotten nor forgiven.
It's NOT an overhaul. Its a bill to profit by killing Americans.
Oh. And you found taxpayer money for more bombs.
In Houston we were recently reminded how much we need to take care of each other. We're BETTER as Americans when we take care of each other.
Amen!!
Here is you overhaul

@JohnCornyn u have my girlfriends healthcare n your hands U sign this bill & she may never b able to get the coverage she needs 75287 I vote
Why do you hate my family so much you will take away our healthcare? #noGrahamCassidy
NEW: Graham-Cassidy ACA Repeal Bill Would Cause Huge Premium Increases for People with Pre-Existing Conditions https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/news/2017/09/18/439091/graham-cassidy-aca-repeal-bill-cause-huge-premium-increases-people-pre-existing-conditions/ …
How about OPEN, Bipartisan hearings? How about a FULL CBO SCORE? You cannot claim 2 be party of Law and Order while continuing subversion.
How can you come up with a good plan when you won't even acknowledge that ins company profits are soaring since #Obamacare began?
Delay Obamacare vote until bipartisan group looking at subject determines if bipartisan solution can be had.  That assures public support.
You are screwing people with pre existing conditions. Do the right thing and vote no. Stop playing games with our healthcare.
REPEAL, no subsidies, sell across state lines, all gov employees participate EXACTLY like we
Is McCain going to betray everyone again? Seems like wasted effort if Globalist McCain will vote against We The People again.
As we #Texans  have said many times before, hold some public #TownHalls & listen to your constituents opinions! We 
Don't Want ACA Repeal!!
More money on the dumpster fire? Is this before or after graham Cassidy vote?
#MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
Oh, #WeReadIt. Section 106 allows states to waive underwriting req's. Insurers could charge through the roof for preexisting conditions.

Our @will_c_fischer says #GrahamCassidy is just #TrumpCare with a new name and still takes health care away from thousands of #veterans. 
Can't we just agree that you just want to kill people so your campaign contibuters can save money, john?
McCain quote about regular order is something. "Is it my problem now that we only have a week?"
This Dallas constituent says no!!
This cruel, immoral bill is bad news, and trying to shove it through at the last minute shows contempt for democracy. Shame on you.
Replibucans are MURDERERS!
Do you even care about constituents? This is disastrous for Texas and USA. Just a big FU to people
