Sen. Susan Collins speaking on Gorsuch nomination to SCOTUS now on Senate floor
ICYMI: they say Nero fiddled while Rome burned
Vote yes. Great guy.
So did Merrick Garland. #stolenseat
So did Garland.  You can stop pretending its about anything else.  Y'all redrew the battlefield for SCOTUS nominations.

No, I want our Senator to stop being obtuse about why there is opposition, and I want the filibuster dead.
You mean like Garland? Where you didn't bother to give him the courtesy of one? Does the hypocrisy burn?

I don't care what you're going to say. Let the storm rage on.
so did Garland
How did u vote with Merrick Garland?
do you like to be reminded of your past faults and that you're 2faced on party lined?
HYPOCRITE! Merrick Garland
so did Garland
And my vote when you come up for re-election will be NO also!!
so did Merrick Garland.
fine, but Garland first.  #garlandnotgorsuch
the whole Trump agenda needs to stop until we get to the bottom of Russia
and Merrick Garland deserved a hearing. Why do you think rules don't apply to GOP? You guys are shameless.

you are simply one of the greatest frauds of all time, you have zero right to utter that phrase or make that demand.
He'd get a down vote from me because his name isn't Merrick Garland.
Something Merrick Garland deserved.
76227 expects you to vote NO to Gorsuch.
Garland deserved an up or down vote. Smh. #gopfail
yes, all nominees deserve that. But GOP broke that tradition.
Damn straight!  This POTUS basically lame duck anyway. So his pick needs to be tabled until "the people have spoken"
All nominees deserve fair consideration except ones nominated by a president under investigation.
As a constiuent, I ask you vote NO on Gorsuch
Shame you didn't think so when an equally qualified, less reprehensible judge was nominated.
#MerrickGarland deserves HEARINGS.
as in, Merrick Garland ...
Funny that
So did Merrick Garland.  If a vote happens vote NO!  We don't need an appointment from a fake president.
so did Garland
Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland #2020
I think it's actually Merrick Garland's turn, but whatever, Senator.
.@JohnCornyn Merrick Garland, @BarackObama and America deserved a hearing and an up or down vote, not lying and obstruction.
So did Merrick Garland. No reason to give a stolen SCOTUS seat to POTUS suspected of colluding with a foreign adversary.
much like Garland?  Oh wait, I forgot, Garland didn't even get a hearing.  @HouseGOP @SenateGOP
Merrick Garland!!!
.@JohnCornyn hmmm. We don't all get what we deserve, do we? Maybe you will in the next election. #hope
Seriously? I don't know how you live with yourself. #MerrickGarland
So did Obama's pick. You reap what you sow.
OK, DOWN IT IS! Merrick Garland.
. . . Like Judge Garland?!?
Merrick Garland sends his regards....
That's more than Merrick Garland was given. #BlockGorusch
Just like Garland did. #GarlandNotGorsuch #hypocrites
Do not let Gorsuch nomination be derailed by Democrats. Use Nuclear option if needed..Dems on wrong side of history.
So did Merrick Garland.
He is an extremist. He should be voted down. The delay however is a possible reprieve for the #GOP. Investigate the POTUS first.
Seriously?  Can dc pols by anymore deceptive and duplicitous? Shouting NO on the last nominee and now complaining about politics
Not until #RussiaGate is over and don't forget what you did about #MerrickGarland
@WhiteHouse  I'm sorry, are you speaking about Merrick Garland?
You know who else deserved an up or down vote?

#MerrickGarland
.@JohnCornyn so did Merrick Garland!
snarky little queen aren't ya Johnny Corny? if only you could govern half as good. saying "no" for years was easy wasn't it?
Vote NO on Gorsuch.  Why are you defending Trump? He is a traitor to the country you say you love and want to protect?
Lemme quote the Bible. "Blow it out thy ass."
He deserves a down vote, not based on his merit, but solely on @SenateGOP stance last year. Stop hypocrisy, Americans are done!
Your hypocrisy knows no bounds. You block Garland. You shield the president from investigation.  You are #complicit sir.
GOP Chair last year said FBI investigation disqualified you from presidency. And now...What a joke.
Merrick Garland much?
of course she does....she's a Republican! Seriously, why would I care what she says?
not while president and administration are under investigation
so did Merrick Garland
Do what you did when she said the same about Judge Garland.
Sure, he can have one, right after Merrick Garland.
I know someone else who deserved an up and down vote. What the @GOP deserves is nothing nice.
Go nuclear if you have to!  Democrats started it!  They changed the rules to get their way. We EXPECT you to vote FOR Gorsuch!
MERRICK. GARLAND.
so did #merrickgarland #RUSSIA #climatechange #taxpayergolftrips #vacation Do your job for TX NOT the GOP!
so did Merrick Garland. No lifetime confirmations for president under FBI investigations.
lost your argument for up or down vote by not giving the same to Marrick Garland.
No vote until you get to the bottom of Trump/Russia. You are on the intel committee - you know trump stole the election.
Shut up bot.
Merrick Garland deserved an up or down vote also. You and your cronies never even conducted hearings.
so did Merrick Garland

you better get Judge Gorsuch confirmed period. Do whatever including Reid option. NO EXCUSES are acceptable.
Trump should not be allowed a Scotus appointment in the last year of his presidency

Way more than you Reps did for GARLAND. Shameful to you.

So did Garland.

so did Merrick Garland.

Garland deserved an up or down vote. But you didn't give him one. You didn't do your job. Investigate trump/Russian connections

Did Merrick Garland deserve a hearing.  Think about that!
***MERRICK*** ***FUCKING*** ***GARLAND***
Down VOTE NO until #Trumprussia investigation is complete & #TrumpTaxReturns are released @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP
You're the worst.
You have no shame
And he should get one. After Garlands.


"He deserves up or down vote." Wow, where have I heard those words before?
Just like Merrick Garland, Senator?

not before merrick garland.  you pay the price of stealing.

You mean Merrick Garland?
