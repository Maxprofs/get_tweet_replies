Hey, @JohnCornyn! Can you remind @SenTedCruz about this when you see him today? Thanks. 
Sports! How droll, old chap.

Say... what are those poors doing out there, with all the pitchforks and torches? What are they yelling about?
I don't know what the big deal is, I said let them eat cake.
Ha. The GOP's energy & effort to defend democracy is on par w/ Harden's energy & effort in G6. Problem is, you're turning over our future.
john cornyn you are the best Trump and do an bangup as the FBI Director.
On the real, though:

Your inaction is complicity, and complicity is treason.

We see you, comrade.
@SenTedCruz Remind both of you that the Constitution and the rule of law trump Trump And the party. Especially Cornyn. Cruz has an excuse
#TrumpRussia #trumpcolluded #TrumpTaxReturns #GOPcomplicit
Seconded.  Town hall in Dallas, please.
I third the motion. I'm from Houston, but I'm willing to drive to Dallas to attend or watch via live stream.
Hey john - you should read some statements made by the Spurs coach about your potus.
You would make a great Director of the FBI.
That's a joke. Don't fall for it. You couldn't lead the Boy Scouts
More like a spur in the ass of the American people!
Wondering why you do not have any principles.   Why do you support a POTUS who lies more than 4x a day?  Oh, you want lead theFBI?    NO
after the meat is exposed the vultures would like a piece of it, John Corny is a vulture along with Trump & Associates
You are a traitor & a fool.  Keep denying the mounting evidence that Trump has committed treason & obstruction, see how it works for you.
Kudos to Texas Southern U. for cancelling Senator John "Abramoff" Cornhole as commencement speaker. Go Bethune-Cookman, 2 outstanding teams!
You are a fraud.

Surely you and @tedcruz have more pressing things. Like getting your heads outta your butts and put country b4 party
Cornyn do not EVEN think for a moment we would accept you as head of FBI, if u want to waste more time then do it. Better to just move along
Still refusing to take the investigation into Trump/Russia seriously.  What are you afraid you're going to find?
Meanwhile back in Washington, we have a raving lunatic president tweeting insane things. But no comment from you.
He doesn't see Anything wrong. He's a coward
#TrumpRussia - Vladimir Putin is working on a 1-2 TRILLION dollar deal with ExxonMobil. @JohnCornyn biggest donor is ExxonMobil
Sen Cornyn thank you for letting us know you stand with Russia. We hoped you would have protected our own democracy. Now we know.
Party over country= crickets on important issues
Since Exxon is your biggest donor & they're in bed w\Putin; you know you're not fit to lead FBI. Just let TX suffer w\ya until 2020.
I thought you Russians were hockey fans?
GOP=Guilty of Putin
TRUMP SAID HE FIRED COMEY BECAUSE OF THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION, WHAT NOW?
"I SAID IT WAS UNLAWFUL"  THE FUTURE IS FEMALE..... DEAL WITH IT PUNK
Is this a picture of @JHarden13 ? I ask because all I see is a man and a beard...
2 fantastic teams, 2 fantastic Senators.  TEXAS has the best
If you get the FBI gig, no loyalty pledges. OK? I worry based on your tweets that you might.
You should not be FBI director. You're the worst and complicit. Pull your name out. America deserves better.
He heard you thank God

.@JohnCornyn just failed our democracy. 

His questioning of the #SallyYates on the Muslim Ban shows us who he is.…
Are you concerned about Trump threatening the freedom of the press? Do you support state run media? Why do you want a criminal running USA?
Don't take the #FBI job.
Run John Run...away from your constituents to give a commencement speech. Oh wait!! The graduates are smart enough to refuse you! Imagine!!

@JohnCornyn is the only man unprincipled enough to carry water for Trump in the FBI: http://www.statesman.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/sen-cornyn-trump-short-list-replace-comey-fbi-director/dSqWrzssqshGRdSSnrqgtL/amp.html …
