@JohnCornyn officially, in broad daylight.  Btw, why are you defending someone who lied under oath in Senate hearing?
22 times?!?!?!? Was this before or after Pres O told Putin he could be more flexible after the election?
was this as President and in the public record? Why yes. See the difference there, son?
the former Senator Sessions meeting wasn't in the public record?? Was it undercovered? Not following
Sessions met while working for the Trump campaign. Trip paid for by campaign. Did not disclose
Where did you get this? Situation ?
Campaign finance - used his campaign funds - then claimed Senate work.
Russian Diplomat sat with Dems during President speech. Does that count as a meeting with them! "Throw the bums out"! (My dad)!
@JohnCornyn I don't care if he did I care that Sessions was not entirely truthful... under oath...
the info has been taken out if context.  Sessions meeting with ambassadors it WAS HIS JOB.
no not really it wasn't.  I understand what he said and the context.
No one cares what you leftinistas obstructionist think. So, get back in the kitchen.
troll much do you
Is that your best? Figured. Stay out of the discussions if you can't add anything of importance. Back to the kitchen.
why are you following me, to tell me to get back in the kitchen? Like that's an insult?
no, so you'll follow me. Maybe you'll learn something and help MAGA!
@BonnieGranny Hmmmmm. Care to explain that dems?  You would think he might have ties to Hillary!!!
How much $$$$ did Bubba get for doing speech in Moscow?
Why was he meeting Nancy P? Question 2 AG were any meetings during campaign or about campaign. Be more specific in questions!
22 times. And, not once did Obama lie about it.
The right has a biggg problem owning their own BS don't they??  
@no1jyd Obviously Obama was receiving updated on how to screw America and the MSM remained silent. No just kidding sorry Russia
what the hell does that mean?
Does what mean?
Over eight years when Obama was prez. How many times did members of the Obama campaign meet with Russian officials in 2008?
There is not automatic problem with US gov meeting foreign gov. The problem is about sworn lies.  Sessions appeared to lie.
he didn't lie if you listen to the question.
Obama and Clinton fine with Russian misbehavior - until she lost election. Then Putin became their tool for attacking Trump.
Did you not watch the debates? Clinton was not fine with it.
That was only after the DNC hacking. Hillary had already given approval for Russia to get our uranium. @DailyCaller
Obama didnt know this til he saw it on Fox News! lol
@DonaldJTrumpJr sure was part of his work
Yea but Dems would rather not talk about that since they have the MSM industry pushing their lies. Wise up and #FireDemocrats
OBAMA is the crooked devious TRAITOR to AMERICA Muslim terrorists! HE'S been getting off 4years! FEDERAL ARRESTS CALLING FOR
isn't that basically his whole job?
& sat w/Democrats pals at Trump's speech.  If he's collaborating w/anyone to help Vladimir..it's the Democrats!
@DonaldJTrumpJr you havent worked out whats an Ambassadors job is yet have you? Of course he would go to the whitehouse
but your dad won't say anything bad about putin.why?putin is an enemy not a best buddy of u. s.
@DonaldJTrumpJr he should 
Didnt come thru back door
@DonaldJTrumpJr obama surrogate
@SenSchumer @BarackObama We need to know what went on in these closed door meetings..  Was Schumer there?
and no ONE lied about it, understand????
And Obama never lied about it.
.@FetchBeer @DailyCaller @JohnCornyn yep - if it was no big deal, then no need to lie. But he did lie. So now what else don't we know?!
Dumbocrats are colluding with the Russians it is becoming very clear.
bless your heart.
I know right. Lol.
How exactly did Sessions lie given context of question?
Just so everyone knows the full Franken question and full Sessions answer. 
Sessions didn't even *answer* the question, giving a lie instead. How dense are you?
No one lied about meetings with the Obama white house. Sessions said he had no communication with Russia when he really did. Your Deflecting
that's not what he said in context, you're lying
Stop fooling yourself & stay away from the (In Context) kool-aid. Sessions lied to the Senators. It's that simple. Doesn't make him all bad
According to this article (most people read only headlines), it was written in the official log. No one denied the meetings.
Also public record: Obama kicked all Russian diplomats out of the US.
Funny they're back now. Guess #obama was more flexible after the election.
@DonaldJTrumpJr We're giving this guy so much press.  Wow, I can see him laughing in his sleep!  Funny sight
And sat with the Democrats during Trump's speech.
@aduanebrown Did Any1 have concern then!? @GOP Dont scramble 2look up constitution r n books 4our PresTrump! Lookup chickenshit
@DonaldJTrumpJr 
Gee whiz, guess he really liked the food!
Nice distraction piece. Only way to alleviate fears is for a full, bipartisan investigation into russia ties.
@DonaldJTrumpJr and it was in public. Big difference buddy
@JohnCornyn what are you hiding?
@waltjesseskylar Politics is what we are seeing. This is why we Americans chose to elect Trump. A voice from oitside the crap.
@JohnCornyn Because that is part of a presidents job. But you all know that. Your just trying to trick the uninformed.
Nice try at a diversion. Did an Obama cabinet member lie under oath about Kislyak's visits?
in public not in hiding and not lied about. Is that so hard to understand? Deflection r us
this back and forth sounds like Kenya politics. Caught lying under oath but hey, even the other side is jot clean. Voila!
so called greatest democracy in the world must have learned a trick or two from African despots. SHAME
That's some outstanding water-carrying, er, journalism there.
Interesting. Did Obama Admin officials deny this under oath?  Were Romney or McCain campaigns hacked by Russia?  No?
Was sitting with the Democratic's during Trump speech to congress? What's the deal with that?
@DonaldJTrumpJr He probably did along with others. One problem Obama did not lie under oath in front of committee and live T. V
Democrats total hypocrites! The way the question was asked lead u to believe visits by Russian Ambassador about election..NOT!
@DonaldJTrumpJr of course  members of our executive and legislative branches would be meeting Russians. Just don't LIE about it
@DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS yeh mayb, but we r much closer to Sergei and Vlad.
@veganvecoh @washingtonpost @PostRoz  Make sure these last two idiots see this!
what a fat F**k. This shit was set up by obama,clinton & soros BUT they will LOSE no matter what crap they try
of course no MSM picked this up!
He was the AMBASSADOR - that's why he was at the White House, that's his job.  No comparison to hidden conduct of Trump aides.
wow obama was a putin stooge the whole time I knew it
also, first sentence?: "The visitor logs, which Obama made public in 2009 in a push for transparency..."
@JohnCornyn Meeting with Russian ambassador =legal. Campaign meddling and perjury not legal. See the difference?
Obama is not the POTUS now, right?...but go ahead and add him to the investigation.
@DonaldJTrumpJr you don't say? Gasp 
@midwestdish kick that piroshki out of this country and order a thinner ambassador to replace him.  Shoot down their fighters 2
So #Russophobic
@swstargal1 With all this BS about Russian involvement, nobody will want to do any work with any foreign diplomat; it's crazy
Yeah and if U will remember Obama's famous quote" after the election I will have more flexibility " but nothing funny going on!
@DonaldJTrumpJr That man is underpaid.
Oh Hell. You're not supposed to think! It's only controversial when your political advisories talk to Russians.
@DonaldJTrumpJr okay I'm sure you realize this was before they colluded with your dad to rigg the election.
pointless garbage, how many times did other ambassadors visit? What were the meetings about according to those there?
This is what needs to be investigated what did obama talk to the Russian in the WH?
and they didn't deny or lie about it.  what's the big deal?
@DonaldJTrumpJr Is this Ambassador like the INVISIBLE MAN? NO ONE seems to be able to remember him??? #deepstate 
@DonaldJTrumpJr Michael Savage is right ! Hire 100 lawyer and sue Democrats, this time don't let them get away!!!
Lol..You guys are hilarious! This joke of an article is so funny!
May we remind you! The current POTUS asked a Foreign Entity to interfere in our Election Process by stealing emails

@DonaldJTrumpJr Why no outrage. What no legal investigation? Why no liberal coverage. We all no why.
Obama may have conspired w Russians against Hillary. We know he HATED her. May he wanted her to lose got Russians to meddle?
@JohnCornyn    Yes in public view
hmmmm
@DonaldJTrumpJr really? OUT IN THE OPEN? 
@DonaldJTrumpJr All you SaD SaD people need to get A LiFe... #MAGA
@DonaldJTrumpJr Investigate That!! Special investigators.
@DonaldJTrumpJr the same man went to the White House in the past 4 years to see Obama four times last year come on investigate
@DonaldJTrumpJr Hmm really! Now why is ok for Obama to have 22 visits from the Russian Ambass.Obama isEvil!
Didn't Obama kick out all the Russian Ambassadors?
Obama is a walking Crime Scene.
@JohnCornyn did they ever lie about whether or not they had a meeting with him?
@DonaldJTrumpJr  oh well how interesting.
He did not have sexual relations with that man !
Investigate
As mom says, " That's the pot calling the kettle black" Dems. Gotta love the fools
@KestnerJerri Look
At this tweet on his Twitter page! "Trade with Russia a WIN-WIN" !
@TuckerCarlson how long until democrats claim Baron Trump met with Russians during transition. This is getting ridiculous. SAD
@jessbriis To hell will all of this--WHERE IS THE MISSING 6 BILLION THAT IS NOT TALKED ABOUT? NEEDS IN DEPTH INVESTIGATION!
An ambassador visited the White House? Call security!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Investigate Obama and Russian.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Schumer and Pelosi must resign now!
Did any of them lie about it while under oath? Were they a matter of public record? Were they campaign surrogates, Baldwin Jr?
@DonaldJTrumpJr Isn't he a beaut? Looks like someone Obama would associate with, along w/ the 'God Damn America' pastor Wright!
@DonaldJTrumpJr     # An. A. Carptener.  GOES.  TO.  LOWES.  #. To. Check. On. Prices. R.  . Deal.
@DonaldJTrumpJr  Hold on there.  The 1st one was set up and coordinat ed by the Obama white house.  2nd was at Jeff office.
If you had a clue, I'm not sure what you'd do with it.
@DonaldJTrumpJr I thought Obama said Romney was an idiot for worrying about Russia
@DonaldJTrumpJr yes Kennedy actually did that in the elections where Reagan was running.....
@DonaldJTrumpJr why did Ted Kennedy not get called out for asking the Russians to interfere with the elections
Did Obama LIE about it? Under Oath?
@LaurelCatherine The people should have been notified about this through the media since Russia is such an bad world influence
Great movie plot: Outgoing president sabotages incoming administration to cover up his own ties with foreign enemies.
Thought @cnn said he was a spy why would @potus44 meet with him 22 times. To set something up??????
and I'm sure that was disclosed right? They were transparent
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Democrat Liberal Hypocrisy on display, aaaaagain.
Looks like he wasn't late for supper...
@DonaldJTrumpJr time to investigate DUMBAMA
.@DailyCaller @DonaldJTrumpJr So what!  As you damn well know, The issue isn't meeting w him, the issue is lying about it under oath. 
@DonaldJTrumpJr Hypocrites!
@LindaSuhler 

Setting up Trump ?
the question is: has he been in a film with Kevin Bacon? If so...#GameOver
it's obvious that the daily caller reader base can't really read.
@DonaldJTrumpJr nothing to see here, please move along.
If he's such a treacherous spy, that anyone who meets with him should resign, why is he in the country?  Send him HOME!
@DonaldJTrumpJr so basically it was Obama that was helping the Russians hack into the DNC and help POTUS Trump win. Investigate
@DonaldJTrumpJr uranium given to Russia ok with liberals. 22 meetings to give iran open season to get nukes ok they look stupid
@DonaldJTrumpJr Obama trying a coup d'etat! Russia is a ruse to get special prosecutor, phony charges, impeachment!
He should be careful, he might die of a heart attack! Over weight! Just over weight!
@DonaldJTrumpJr deflecting again. Obama didn't need Russia's help to steal the election
That is public diplomacy, not private interference.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Oh, what a twisted tale the Dems weave....
@DonaldJTrumpJr   Sounds like Obama and Kisyak conspired to throw the election. Now what?
@DonaldJTrumpJr Unlike your pops, Obama didn't deny it!
Did Obama lie about those visits under oath like Sessions did?  No.  Then who cares?
@LindaSuhler This guy should be sent back to mother Russia. At the LEAST he's a shit stirrer. At the worst....well!?
@realDonaldTrump  they were just taking grandkids.  Look in 2 the $ from Russia 2 Dems/Clinton fnd. $ = truth
and vintage "thats different" comments from the hypocrite left ensues
.@DailyCaller @DonaldJTrumpJr yeah morons, through the FRONT DOOR, not behind the scenes.
was that before or after Russia interfered with the election?
@DonaldJTrumpJr  did they discuss lifting sanctions? Did they lie about it or fail to disclose? Oh...no.
@DonaldJTrumpJr where do the dems get off trying to ruin sessions. When BO started this. You gutless republicans fight back
where do the Russians get off putting Trump in office?
@DonaldJTrumpJr they met to get VP Biden's son a job at Russian oil company, investigation???
4th Trump surrogate selling America to Russia. That should bother you down to your bones.
I think they fed him up
@DonaldJTrumpJr how often did he lie about it and tell congress he didn't meet with him?
@DonaldJTrumpJr what's ur point? At least I can proudly say, Putin and the ambassador didn't put Obama in the white house.
Not during an election!
Ok now we have to Call President Putin and get this guy a Raise since he's sooo good at his job.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @schumer @pelosi u dems sure play with the russians a lot.
@DonaldJTrumpJr wow is that the pot calling the kettle black or what?!
tell it like it is the truth thanks
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump  Trump keeps lying about his Russian connections and actively hides his taxes & finances.
Maybe-They had this Russian Theater Production being Produced behind the scenes by Their Globalist Progressive Cult?Plotting
Democrats are such hypocrites: with Russia contacts & email server use:no outrage over HRC & Obama
@DonaldJTrumpJr …let's not be confused…it is NOT a crime to meet with the Russians…it IS a crime to LIE under oath…
@DonaldJTrumpJr no problem. That was a dem. President and they have different rules.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Right there with all his liberal buddies.
Knew Obama was working for the Russian govt. LOL!
@DonaldJTrumpJr That's OK cause it was Osama
@DonaldJTrumpJr Because he was the ambassador and Obama was the president, not a candidate.  Try to keep up.
OHHHHHHHH REALLY... and "they" are talking about Trump!!!!!!??????
