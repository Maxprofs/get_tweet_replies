"hi, we're the Veals."
remember that concerning the occupant of the executive branch
@JohnCornyn @GorsuchFacts If that we're true Merrick Garland would be the nominee.
I am pretty sure that who ever writes these tweets has never really seen or heard the things that this senator does & says
So Merrick Garland? How do u justify that?
But Gorsuch is conservative and some of his rulings suck. Hobby Lobby?
#MerrickGarland
So cringeworthy--Constitutional duty of congress to give nominees a hearing.
put security of country first.  #impeachTrumpFirst.  proceedings would already be underway if #HRC or #Obama
@JohnCornyn @GorsuchFacts Agree.  Will you remember when things aren't going your way?
I call BULLSH*T on that lie. Bush F*cked America for years with his stacking of RW activist judges. U want same
Don't bring up law when you didn't do your job.
Manipulation of the process has a very particular stench, @SenateMajLdr - Given your contempt for integrity, you should hold your tongue
actually the rule of law is liberal or conservative depending upon the interpretation of the judge. R u fatuous?
stop Trumpcare!!! People will be devastated!
it appears your hypocrisy knows no bounds.
U forgot that when u refused to give #MerrickGarland a hearing
UNLESS an "uppity colored" PRESIDENT nominates a Supreme Court Justice!
you say that now but not a 8 months a ago with Merrick.
hollow words from the treasonous leader who stole seat, hid Trump's crimes
@JohnCornyn @GorsuchFacts #ConfirmGarland #MerrickGarland
. Nor does it appear to be presidential. Unless you're DJT
Gorsuch is qualified. Not the issue. You didn't do your job. MGarland first then Gorsuch if you get a second
And why didn't we feel this way when Garland was nominated??????
Really? The. Why didn't you give #MerrickGarland a hearing? #hypocrisy
except, of course, when it came to Republicans denying an Obama appointed judge a hearing, amirite?
Merrick. Garland.

Jesus, Mitch. 

You are exhausting.
Was that your mindset for the last 8 years? Now is your chance to be responsible to the people you represent. #Resist
then why did you block Merrick Garland?
Do these words come to mind when you lie to push unethical "HC" legislation or block #TrumpRussia investigation?
don't act like u care about rule of law when u break constitution by denying rightful POTUS his #SCOTUSnominee?
Shame you don't really believe that.
This is certainly true, and something you forgot when you invented the Garland rule out of thin air.
What Law kept Judge Garland from his Seat? This hearing should not even be happening.
@JohnCornyn #obstructgorsuch #obstructionistgop #mcconnelllies
what do you know old man, NOTHING !
@JohnCornyn @GorsuchFacts Mitch, you're a hypocrite. You hold no status on morality. Hush.
Merrick Garland
How can you talk about the law with a straight face after blocking the Garland appointment for a year?
funny, you seemed to have made it conservative by denying a seated president his nominee.
I see you blocked Merrick Garland on that basis. Shame on you for the two faced approach.
@JohnCornyn, then why did you steal the seat from Garland?  You are both partisan hypocrites and deep down you know it.
but when YOU choose to apply it is most definitely partisan.
So @SenateMajLdr why didn't you obey the Rule of Law when a Democrat was POTUS? Cite the law that caused you to refuse Garland a hearing?
Then your excuse for blocking Merrick Garland and leaving the SC seat empty for months is ???
Not your nominee to put forward. Merrick Garland is. #SCOTUSnominee
is this a comedy or parody account?
@JohnCornyn @GorsuchFacts what was wrong with merrick garland then?
Interpretation of law can be biased based on beliefs. Overt or covert discrimination exists in institutions.
should have applied that with Obama's nom.
full repeal of ACA.
but corruption of law by @GOP, you and @SpeakerRyan is.
@JohnCornyn @GorsuchFacts I hope you all remember that when talking about Russia and Trump
@JohnCornyn @GorsuchFacts You should have thought this when you denied Judge Garland a hearing!!
You say that now, conveniently forgetting you refused to let Obama nominate someone. PURE POLITICS & Hypocrasy
TRUE, it isn't so stop using it that way-you should have nominated someone UNDER OBAMA-POLITICS ALL THE WAY
Adherence to the rule of law has become a Conservative position, because Liberals abandoned it.
M Garland wouldn't have been denied a hearing if you believed in these principals. Does your #hypocrisy keep u awake at night?
@JohnCornyn @GorsuchFacts we know your wife got her job after you made sure we didn't find about #TrumpRussia before election.
#hypocrite  you lost all credibility @gop
YOU are a hippocrate. You blocked Judge Garland in hopes of installing a right wing ideologue.
hah! Not what you said last year! Hypocrite extraordinaire
sweet!  what time is Garland's confirmation hearing?
if you believed that Garland would be sitting in the seat you stole from him. HYPOCRITE!
@JohnCornyn @GorsuchFacts then why didn't you vote up or down merrick you lying scumbag? You're worse than the Russians
- you're such a hypocrite, you are the swamp, you're actions as a representative aught to be considered treason
Then explain how/why you denied Pres. Obama's nominee a confirmation hearing. You, sir, are a liar.
@JohnCornyn @GorsuchFacts Was Article Two not law last year? Did it take the year off?
then why didn't you give Obama's nominee a hearing. #PantsOnFire
You are a hypocrite who played obstructionist for a year. #flipflop  #liarliarpantsonfire
If you really believed that you would have held a vote on Garland. Learn to be honest!!
very true and you refused to do your job and even hear the moderate pick. You're the worst
You're a despicable man. I hope one day you pay for all your crimes against humanity & against our country.
What about this then? MERRICK GARLAND was nominated legally by a sitting POTUS not UNDER investigation!
@PolitiFact #RepealAndReplaceGOP
Party before the USA. That's your motto.  You have ZERO credibility.
a year ago u said it was
if gorsuch doesnt answer the questions he is asked he will not be confirmed. No gop so called transparency
seat belongs to Merrick Garland!!!
Then why are republicans doing their best to stall and divert #TrumpRussia probe?
VOTE THIS EMBARRASSMENT OUT !!
You cheated the democrats out of their scotus pick so save you sanctimonius crap for someone else.
@JohnCornyn @GorsuchFacts Cornyn did not want to vote for judges in 2015 and he cares because it favors his party cheating
If that's the case, then find another candidate.  All you have done is tout this conservative credentials.
@JohnCornyn @GorsuchFacts #unpatriotic #lies #russia #potustravel #
@JohnCornyn @GorsuchFacts So why wasn't Merrick Garland given a hearing?
hmmm, your actions speak louder than your words.
If you believe this, then it is your duty to hold confirmation hearings for Merrick Garland.
It should be conservative!
So why wouldn't you give Merrick Garland a fair hearing? If Gorsuch had any scruples,he wouldn't even accept nom
.@SenateMajLdr @GorsuchFacts then why didn't you confirm the seat in, say, 2016? Wanted to wait 4 criminal president? #craven #ImpeachTrump
But Cornyn contortionist try excuse explain away Trump tweet.say essntially no take literally
@JohnCornyn @GorsuchFacts  GOP law is obstructionism first; deny second; shift blame 2 others 3rd; & profit from position, 4th

@JohnCornyn @SenateMajLdr @GorsuchFacts #RUSSIA. #stopconfirmations
#StolenSeat Rightful hearings are those that you blocked for #MerrickGarland
@JohnCornyn you're a liar when you say that, what happened to #MerrickGarland ?
#MerrickGarland
Time for you to go. #DitchMitch
@JohnCornyn @GorsuchFacts #ConfirmGarland.
Then what was wrong with Merrick Garland? He is a moderate jurist respected by all. GOP goal? Politicize #SCOTUS
@JohnCornyn  Please vote to postpone the Gorsuch hearings until after the FBI finishes the Trump/Russia hearings.
Nope- it is holding hearings on the real nominee for SUPCO, the one Obama sent. You are a disgrace.
Back to 1921 SCOTUS justices rec'd minimum 60 votes 24 of 28 times. Seems reasonable for such important job.
And yet, you wouldn't even speak to Merrick Garland. I don't think you believe that. Partisanship is your guide.
@JohnCornyn @GorsuchFacts Which is EXACTLY why trump should be impeached.
God you're slimy.
Maybe not but the Constitution is liberal as it includes everyone equally & is broad not narrow
Where was this sentiment when you blocked Merrick Garland? Sounds strictly partisan.
is there a bigger hypocrite than Mitch McConnell? It is apparently not politics when you get your way...
How would you know................
Garland
Sir, you are a hypocrite. #dontconfirmgorsuch
where was that sentiment when you obstructed Garland?Don't act innocent now weasel! 
#NoGorsuch disabled at risk
If you believe that why did you refuse to have a hearing for Merrick Garland?
what about #MerrickGarland?  Your blind allegiance to #Trump will be your downfall. #Complicit #GOPHyprocracy
are you f-ing serious? #citizensunited #TermLimits
HYPOCRITE
The understanding of Rule of Law is not conservative liberal.
Then put Merrick Garland in.
bro the law is whoever is funding your campaign
yes it is you would let Obama pick a Justice that was nothing but politics you're just as crooked as Trump
perfect. You did not give Merrick Garland a hearing therefore you need to step down. #ToneDeaf
The rule of Law is to keep the masses controlled.  Rich people do what they want & use the law to justify it.
You wouldn't know the rule of law if it bit you!!  Merritt Garland more qualified than Gorsuch & you refused a hearing/vote! R's- Hypocrites
Then why wouldnt you give Merrick Garland a hearing? Oh, OK you thought he'd be a liberal. Thought so.
.@SenateMajLdr Says the guy who makes EVERYTHING partisan.
YOU STOLE THAT SEAT!!!! That's a fact. It's insane for you to do that & tweet this. You have no respect for law.
Then what was wrong with Judge Garland? #SCOTUS
Like you give a shit about the rule of law. #StolenSeat
Rule of law meant you should have considered Merrick Garland.
but that is exactly what you have made it in stonewalling Obamas choice nothing but bs
Denying President Obama's nominee a senate hearing is perhaps the most unAmerican act. Talk rule of law!
odd to hear that from you Mitch, who can't see past partisan biases to help average Americans. SAD!
~ Hmm, but the politics of "No" worked so well for you.
Your own actions prove you don't believe that.
Baloney.
HOBBY LOBBY
Gorsuch is unqualified because of his habit of ruling for big business
#TheResistance #StopGorsuch #Trumprussia
@GorsuchFact But you can manipulate it to your own means, which you have shown many times!
How do you explain holding off on President's Obama nomination?
Garland, Garland, Garland.  Since this is Trump's last year, let's deny him a vote, too.
Apparently it was while Obama was in office and eligible to appoint SCOTUS judge... we don't forget!
FUNNY HOW CONSERVATIVE IT WAS WHEN MERRICK GARLAND WAS DENIED AN AUDIENCE
Look who found the rules after more than a year! And now everyone is suppose to make it easy for u!
very true.  And after what you did to Garland, you ought to sit back and shut up and let things play out
why should we trust anything this president is proposing. We should stop until the traitor issue is cleared up
But oh how they can bend this rule. #DoNotConfirmGorsuch. He is NOT for women and our rights!
Literally nobody here agrees with you. @SenateMajLdr @GorsuchFacts
Ms Obama please shut up you and your husband did enough ti ruin our country.
why the hell r u repubs not giving Merrick Garland the seat? U R LYING U WANT HIM BCUZ HE IS CONSERVATIVE LIARS
Says the man loyal only to party and not country.
After what you did to Garland… you are not fit to lead this great country.
funny that is not what you have said in the past
Remind me... What was the outcome of Judge Merrick's Senate confirmation hearing that you wouldn't let happen?
Never discuss rule of law while enabling a traitor. Embarrassing yourself...once again.
You really need to be quiet ALL DAY on this subject least you forget #Garland
#MerrickGarland
If that were true you would not have stolen the seat and stacked the deck
