Democratic Senators are asking DHS why the Trump administration repeatedly de-emphasizes domestic terror attacks. 
So you can't read? #Censure #CensureTrump
Hey, remember when Trump cut funding from the DHS's anti-extremist program, and specifically ended investigation of white supremacists? 
Waist, fraud and abuse:

It better not include Erik Prince. I don't want my taxes paying millionaires to profit off of war.
Cannot say that's in my top 5 things he needs to be working on.
Uh, there is no strategy.
Let me guess, send more troops. I've got a plan for you, condemn the racist president.
I wonder who he'll offend this time?
Kabul Trump Hotel going up? Bet he says invest
Trump is the problem. He needs to go as does everyone that supports his treasonous ass.  Be a Patriot.  Stand up for the people.
Keep telling yourself that.  Not sure how you can be prideful and boast about voting for Trump. 

New numbers on Trump's conduct as president, according to NBC News/Marist poll. #morningjoe 
Trump is a racist! And let me think, you support a racist!
God help us all

Wow, Cornyn, really on the ball....this was announced yesterday...were you the last to find out, mister whip?
Yawn
This is disgusting and you're required to denounce it.
All we need from you is a vote in favor of the articles of impeachment for @realDonaldTrump (and stop voting for his racist judiciary picks)
Hope he just reads and doesn't go off his handlers script. Maybe he can have a day free of his insane, racist talk
can't end good @MSNBC @JoaquinCastrotx @PoliticalDiscor @indivisibletxjc @indtx36 @texasdemocrats

@danielchaitin7 Yeah. You can listen & tell us what he REALLY meant since he cannot form complete sentences.
Nazis to left of me...Nazis to the right...heres is Nazi @JohnCornyn stuck in the middle with Trump

And attempt to distract us from his hate comments. We won't forget
This is scary
Let's hope he sctually talks about it in a meaningful way &  doesn't say something ridiculous.  Don't interfere with my soaps either !
Hey John. I haven't heard you standing up for the POTUS   To bad your a follower instead of a leader
Is it written what he is going to say or from his stupid mind.
Boy I bet this is a humdinger. I hope somebody wrote it for him and he's just reading it
Impeach...don't want to hear the rasict traitor
Gotta love the Texas GOP. They would never espouse domestic terrorism...errrr. She's GOP chair of Denton county. Rotten to the core.
Remember when this jackass said Palestinian-Israeli peace wasn't really that hard? Zero credibility.
Abbas is right on this one: If after seven months Greenblatt can't even say "two states", why waste eveyrone's time? http://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/palestinians/1.807962 …
If it isn't clear "this jackass" always refers to Trump, and possibly his lackeys like Cornyn.

@realDonaldTrump 
What strategy could 45 possibly develop?
Call it the Mattis/McMaster/Kelly initiative, w/moron-in-chief taking credit.
Here we go. Lies, lies, and more lies. Sigh.
a little light reading for you
Exclusive: The Mercer family who helped install Donald Trump is deeply connected to Russia.  @traciemac_Bmore https://narativ.org/2017/08/20/politics-of-greed/ …
Announcing how he's privatizing our interests there to Mr. Prince, then wasting breath on random stupid nonsense.

Trump’s Nazis shout their agenda and GOP Congress carries it out. 
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/19/republican-party-white-supremacists-charlottesville …
Take notes John, I'll be busy doing something useful .
Like any American can believe a single word that comes out of trumPutin's mouth. How can you still support this man? R U a traitor also?
Cornyn just wants more Americans to die. He is upset Deathcare wasn't passed but will be happy with war.
oh, we done with NK ? health ? Nazi's ? infrastructure ? councils?the moron i s mad John,and you will sink with him now @txlege @TXDemWomen
More lies. He needs to be gone
U better get with McConnell and rest of the RINO's and decide how to work against him.u don't stand behind anything else he does or says.
Heaven help us....
So Now ur talking about Trump! Why haven't u supported him from beginning? Too busy holding ur finger up to c which way the wind is blowing!
Smoke and mirrors to deflect #racism and #trumprussia
@JohnCornyn I have no intention of voting 4 U ever! As a #Republican #Croney U disgust me! God Bless Texas without @JohnCornyn  @POTUS @VP
Diverting attention from his crimes and stupidity again. Anyone supporting him now is knowingly supporting a racist Nazi sympathizer.
It's unfortunate that you've never lived up to being a leader.  Sad for you
Let's hope those prepared statements don't get sidetracked by how he REALLY feels or asinine tweets.  The "HEEL" has no sole *)
Incumbents should worry about midterms. I will no longer vote straight Republican. I will vote against every incubment senator.

We should all prepare now for the punditocracy to gush when Trump reads from a teleprompter without saying anything pro-Nazi https://twitter.com/HowardKurtz/status/899354740513001476 …
Are you still supporting this fraud?  Why don't you do something that matters?
His distraction will cost American lives.
#WeThePeople are screwed. His gonna go off on another tangent and "good guys" being in the crowd or his inauguration crowd size.
Let me guess...fire and fury and, frankly, power like the world has never seen...blah blah blah...I won.
Yay--another shit show. 
Ur getting voted out, Cornyn.

This is why. You've chosen party over country, you have no shame, we'll show U what we think on Election Day

Will he stick to a script or tell us how he really feels?  Will Prince take over war as paid mercenary & loot the US treasury?
Senator, That is a very scary thought.  I will pray tonight that it not be something embarrassing or self serving as other times.
I can't wait.
I still can't believe your tepid response to Trump's remarks re:Charlottesville. Sam Houston, you are not
Heaven help us.
Trump wants to cut funding for low-income housing by $7 billion My mother is homeless- This is not a joke- We are going to vote you out
And Trump plans to pardon racist sheriff Arpaio Tuesday. One speech will eclipse the scripted one, no doubt. Will you stand mute once again?
In @SECDEFUS #SecDef I trust.
God help us. Do your job and impeach trump.
Russia. Tax returns. Russia. Conflicts of interest. Maybe after these are resolved, someone will care what he thinks about Afghanistan.
Will you please post another picture of your name plate?


Today would be a good day to investigate @JohnCornyn.
Trump? Strategy? God help us all.
Why hasn't he defeated ISIS yet? Isn't that why you voted for him? #Winning
Here's to hoping he doesn't go off script.

Is he going to remind us how many votes he got?


His crying voice echoes in our ears till this day. 
Our hearts were with him every single moment until he got to the hospital. 

"No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion..." 
Yes, certainly reading from a script carefully crafted by GENERALS who didn't avoid service by lying about #bonespurs 
#LiarInChief
#Nazis
Is the strategy to keep his mouth shut & let adults handle the situation?

Asking for a few milllion friends.
I predict that it'll be uninformed and overreaching, consisting mostly of bombastic propaganda.
I predict it'll be terrific. The best strategy you've ever seen. Tremendous.
Still supporting 45 are we?
Cornyn isn't the sharpest tool in the shed.  Yes he does

#RestInPower Heather Heyer, who gave her life today in defense of liberty and justice for all. We will not forget you. #Charlottesville 
Bet its 10% strategy and rest is self praise, ego, and Obama
And Hillary bashing
So true. How could I forget!!!
Unacceptable.  #CensureTrump #Censure
Trump: "I think there's blame on both sides... you also had people that were very fine people on both sides." (via ABC) 
It will involve movement towards continued protection of #Opioid yielding fields. But he won't say that outright of course.

Why don't you do something to the liberals and socialist causing harm to people. Cops  and normal people. You with Americans or against?
"do something" to us? *laughs* What...scare us on Boston Common with a pathetic "free speech rally" with only a 20 person turnout? Try again
I'm guessing by "do something" he means arm us to protect against people like him.
I'm probably his worst nightmare then....LOL
#censure #CensureTrump
This was quite a segment from @CNN that will be shared far and wide 
He's afraid of Paul Ryan's town hall tomorrow on CNN with @jaketapper
"Town hall" ha
When will you be done sucking up to Trump and do what's right?
Not today? Oh yeah.. he's still on the back nine.
All I need for bingo is electoral college, Hillary Clinton, the wall, his wealth, and some shaky economic stats.

Topic doesn't matter.

Oh lord...
I'm sure you'll be proud so long as it distracts from reality and furthers your Koch agenda. You're disgraceful. #worstsenatorinusa
R u GOPers planning on bashing him immediately after the speech or will you all wait a few hours.. sir?
Best thing he could do for the troops is resign. #TrumpMustResign
Any plans for a #TOWNHALL yet?
