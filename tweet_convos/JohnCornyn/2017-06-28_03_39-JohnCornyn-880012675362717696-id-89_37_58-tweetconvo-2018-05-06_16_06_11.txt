Probably because you're killing their means of survival.
They are folding because u Rep cretins r refusing to pay them & r undercutting them.  Quit lying and have a Town Hall, Coward. #Traitor
don't be proud of your sabotage. Stop trying to steal people's health care so you and your friends get a tax cut.
Repeal all of #Obamacare now like you promised for 7 yrs.
There's only so much #GOPsabotage they can withstand …
Yeah because you and your lot sabotaged them from the beginning by withholding the critical funding to make them effective.
And you take pleasure in that! Will your bill reopen those coops? No. So shut up
Boom! #MicDrop
Do you actually believe we don't understand that GOP rhetoric and policies destabilized it.  Not all voters are as shallow as your base.
You do realize that OCare was failing and insurers began pulling out when O was President? Try blaming the Russian next.
That's why it needs to be fixed. CBO reports that the massive hitby the BCRA to our econ will also affect ppl w other insurance.
T & co are Trying to make it fail by withholding from the insurance companies.
Imagine if this administration, left individual mandate, didn't mess with subsidies and pushed signups. The vendors would stay. #Trumpcare
You are over 70- you have it all. Others do not. Healthcare should be a basic right
Success! Who knew ACA would collapse without government support it was designed to receive?!?
That's what happens when you threaten to withhold subsidies from the markets. They're pulling out because you're making them do it.
So fix the problems, back room obstructionist; you had 7 YEARS!
It's too bad you weren't better at your job @JohnCornyn or you would have fixed this before now.

GOP REFUSED to make ACA better & fix what didn't work. Why does it have to be repeal and replace when you can simply fix it?!
Due to Republican sabotage as you well know. You men are LOOSERS. #GOPfail
Disingenuous to say due to flawed plan.  Insurers know GOP is rewriting the Law.  Be Honest w the People
Call it what it IS. @senateGOP @houseGOP sabotage ACA to advance their agenda of Tax cuts for wealthy. Majority of us KNOW the truth. #2018
BullShit! From GOP sabotage!
Because you have tried to make them fail.
You blocked funding for the risk corridor program, states opted out, and they actively tried to get people not to enroll.
It's despicable that making this program fail is a higher priority to Republicans than making sure Americans are ensured.
gop needs leadership in congress on hcare.....need to pass hcare or else why vote for gop if cant govern.
Thanks republicans!
I am ur constituent. GOP sabotaged ACA 2 cause exactly what is happening. How much money will u get from tax cut that guts Medicaid?
Then put the subsidies back in place.
Checkmate in 4 moves. Dems refuse to concede.
Your constant complaints about the ACA are only proof that we need to move to a single payer system that covers all at lower costs.
thanks to Republican sabotage.
Congress should have fixed it instead of playing games.
Yabbut ....
The CBO says explicitly that BCRA WILL NOT SOLVE the problem of low population counties with single or no insurer in non group market. https://twitter.com/sangerkatz/status/880060164765888512 …
universal health care- just like all other civilized nations who are not even as wealthy as the USA.
Quit soreading fake news
Why ?  GOP didn't funds loses and they should have !!! U own it... your mess ! FIX ACA
Complete Healthcare,less talk!Recess more important than healthcare.Actions display your priorities.Swamp prevails!
You might want to let @NancyPelosi know.  Apparently she is clueless
Working exactly according to plan.
If the Dems read the OCare Bill first before they voted it in, they would have seen failure coming.

POINT 7: CBO lays blame for the insurer exit largely with Trump.   In fact... 12 
they are leaving because of instability brought on by the Republicans & their obsession to destroy healthcare. U broke it now fix it morons
It's folded because every single Republican wants to kill it and refuses to support and look for ways to improve it.
Majority in house and senate, vote cancelled...
Which is why you should be working with all senators to come up with a solution that works, and everyone benefits from. Do your job.
There is no solution that works.  There is no solution that everyone benefits from.  Those are Democrat talking points not reality.
maybe you dont cut huge tax break checks to Rich ppl.. and u take that trtillion dollars to give health care to ppl who clean your toilet
You had 8 years Maj Whip & all you have 2 show is a lame bill written by 13 old men & unacceptable to you own colleagues. Disgraceful.
That's called a GOP landslide. Obstructionist GOP didn't participate in exchanges & didn't expand Medicaid. Party over country & folks = GOP
A disaster brought to America by Trump creating uncertainty in insurance market.
Yet you fo nothing to help address the problem. Just fix the problems with Obamacare.
This is how the Architects of ACA designed it. Get though the 2016 election and then downsize ObamaCare to "Single Payer." Not in our USA!
well John the current system needs to be tweaked do you have a plan that is FAIR 4 ALL @indtx36 @indivisibletxjc @MSNBC
You know if you stab something over and over you can't then pretend innocence when it dies.
You need new talking points. You broke it now fix it so more people have health insurance, not fewer. Not tax cuts for the rich.
Democrats broke it.
You've had nearly a decade to craft a replacement and all you can think of is a huge tax cut for the wealthy. Sad, John, sad.
CBO led by your R appointee acknowledged in report that current instability is in large part because of 45 & R behavior
Stop undermining.
17% of Americans approve of Republican healthcare destruction bill:  http://www.npr.org/2017/06/28/534612954/just-17-percent-of-americans-approve-of-republican-senate-health-care-bill?utm_source=twitter.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=morningedition&utm_term=nprnews&utm_content=20170628 …
GOP needs to STOP SABOTAGING ACA!!! Easily fixed if GOP would just work with dems, but u need that money fir rich tax cuts!
You cut it off at the knees.
Thank the GOP for the failure in Maine: http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-maine-obamacare-20170417-story,amp.html …
The same broken record lies every http://day.You  sabatoged the market You goal is to take healthcare from as many as you can
