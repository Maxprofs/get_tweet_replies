@pfikac @mySA I'm with them.  You are NOT indispensible .  I'm a voting Texas woman.
you're concerned about signs when our President says "sometimes I just walk right up to them and grab them by the p,:;/".
B Clinton abused women. Hypocrisy. Fight for ALL Women's Rights - ALL the time.
When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn. Proverbs 29:2
if only @realDonaldTrump hadn't said all those terrible things that people repeated in their signs.
Clinton was Impeached for doing worse. Where was the outrage then? No matter, wrong is wrong.
Gary I was in elementary school for Bill so I can't answer for that.
Trump talks about it, Clinton "did it". Neither is right. Always do what is right.
I agree that people should always do what is right.
I find these inappropriate, so everyone look at them...
IMO, the salient fact here is the USA is the only country in the industrialized world that doesn't have universal single-payer health care.
@pfikac @mySA Not suitable for PG audiences? Buck up . TX women think "grab 'em by the " is a stain on our republic.
FU JohnCornym. You're an embarrassment to the good people of Texas and an example of the worst of Texas.
Lol, as if the president of the United States and the leader of your party, the sexual predator and serial adulterer, is.
@pfikac @mySA Senator, the rights granted to citizens by The First Amendment are not subject to MPAA ratings.
even in a liberty protected nation moral decency matters.
60k YOUR constituents
U don't care bout them
U care about GOP only
Gerrymandering ur lifeline
Watch DJT Hollywood Accesses tape
Most were witty and insightful, only few questionable. You may learn a lot about voters by studying them instead of dismissing.
You delicate snowflake. Do we need to find you a safe space?
Our president isn't suitable for PG audiences.  Gotta fight fire with fire!
@pfikac @mySA sorry if someone offended u hwvr many of us r offended by the attack on our civil rights.
Trump is not suitable for PG either, impeach him
Check out your boss' language before you pass judgement.
The demonstrattions were peaceful. If "civility" means bowing to your right-wing agenda without response, you can stow it.
I'm less concerned with the verbiage than I am with WHAT THEY PROTESTED. You should be, too.
Your presidential candidates words were not suitable for PG audiences on repeated occasions which lowered the standard for all.
In the words of "honorable" Trump, "Grab em by the Pussy. You can do anything you want"
When Cheney told Leahy to "GO F*** YOURSELF" on the Senate floor (where there are rules of decorum!) you were outraged, right??
you know what IS suitable for PG audiences? A voting booth to vote you out of office : ).
good luck on re-election. Make no mistake
Civility? Have you met @POTUS? @realDonaldTrump grabs pussies, oggles naked teens, & raped his 1st wife! Lrrdship starts at top.
.@JohnCornyn @pfikac @mySA What do you expect, after you elect a president who was born fucked up?
https://mobile.twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/516382177798680576?lang=en …
at least the people carrying the signs didn't become our #fakepresident #pussygrabber
Did you complain about these?
They could have been worse, @JohnCornyn.
@pfikac @mySA what is wrong with you Senator? Can you not hear and see Donald Trump?
just a little lockeroom talk.
Oh but saying "grab her by the pussy" is?  Catcalling women who walk down the street is?  Making anti women laws is? Rape is?
Remember when you said the same thing about your buddies protesting against Obama? Me neither.
@pfikac @mySA It's a good thing we're all adults.  Thanks for mentioning the march. Many Texans attended.
Wait until you see the signs we make for you.
Does this offend?
I'll just leave this here.
really you people dont deserve sivility
Well, we don't have a President suitable for PG audiences.
Check out these signs. Not suitable for PG audiences.
What do you think about what "President" Trump said about grabbing women? By the PUSSY!  Well?
Yeah, why can't everyone be as godly, civil, polite and respectful as republicans?




out your "president's" speeches. Not suitable for PG audiences. But you're ok w/him right? #hypocrite
Check out Donald Trump's "locker room" talk at work. Not suitable for PG audiences. Have a seat.
The POTUS normalized it and you all turned the other way, well we OWN that word! Deal With IT
In the Texas Governor's race recently, "abortion Barbie" was a fixture in demonstrations against Wendy Davis. No one is innocent
Senator, tho they may not be suitable for PG audiences, you better pay attention or you may not be suitable to be our Senator
maybe this sign is more "civil" to you?
Your state did this two months ago. Stop pretending you give a fig about children. https://www.texastribune.org/2016/11/28/texas-quietly-moves-forward-cuts-therapy-services/ …
@pfikac @mySA And yet, Mr. C., the kids who were there appeared unfazed. You should have gone and listened to the people.
Thousands of people from the state you represent march in the capital and you appear to be condemning their opinions. #noclass #WomensMarch
Our president says the word "pussy" but if I quote him on a sign I'm the profane one??
pity you didn't attend, sir. Perhaps you could have told us to be more ladylike.
@pfikac @mySA The president isn't suitable for PG audiences.
.@JohnCornyn Over 50,000 of your constituents were out protesting. I do hope you've got a better response than this.
the Trumpet is what's not suitable for PG audiences.
@pfikac @mySA We wish you would have been here to listen to us, but alas we had to march.
@pfikac @mySA Jesus. It's not the 1950s anymore. Much rather have child exposed to sign about lady parts over rifle or gun.
Check out the 45th President of the United States. Not suitable for any nation, especially the United States. #AmericanShame
your office is our next stop. Get ready!
@JennyBenni @pfikac @mySA get you some smelling salts you dainty little thing!
@pfikac @mySA "love trumps hate". Such language! My stars
.@JohnCornyn such a paternalistic comment to make and a problem we're trying to correct.  Stay tone deaf and get defeated.
what about the fake lynchings of President Obama in his 2 inaugurations...where were you to speak out against that?!?!!?
do you forget that you work FOR these people?
.@JohnCornyn @pfikac @mySA Sounds like you're a #snowflake Mr. Senator. A snowflake I won't vote for. #WomensMarch
If following Madonna is women then they can leave Texas get the hell out. The Ladies can stay.
bye, egg. @JohnCornyn
Trumpy's behavior has diminished civility, unfortunately.
@pfikac @mySA Grab em by the pussy is such a better way to say it
.@JohnCornyn Check out the signs of your constituents, John ... I've got lots. 
#WomensMarch
thread continued on your reply ... with the utmost civility.
I would hope for more civility by everyone https://twitter.com/johncornyn/status/823218689164066817 …
@pfikac Kind of like your p*ssy grabbing president. Guess you think sexual assault is better than women’s rights.
we'll all live. I thought we weren't being so PC any longer anyway.
Just emulating Trump's example.
& that language shld b in a bill banning Sharia Law in all 50 states. Also MB & CAIR on Terror list.
@pfikac @mySA just wondering if this is pg?
@pfikac @mySA you haven't seen anything yet.  Tick tock John.
It was actually X-rated signage and language both...

has Trump *ever* been suitable for PG audiences? Might I remind you why protestors are saying the word p***y in the first place?
why aren't you more concerned with the WH press secretary blatantly lying to the American public?
Possibly, and are you hearing their message though?! Important to see the magnitude of this
I applaud Texans for peacefully protesting in the Women's March. We will be working everyday to advance important causes.
Dear John,you are so judgemental.  Don't think that'll get the votes you'll need.
I look forward to your reliable and steady condemnation of our NC-17 President's statements and antics the next four years
@pfikac @mySA how many things has Trump said that arent appropriate for pg audiences? These things are at least for noble causes
WE THE PEOPLE get to say exactly what we think - Check it out, it’s in the 1st Amendment
How about the crowds of your constituents marching? Any comments on that?
You should listen to them you can't cheat and win forever.Texas is not counting it's votes we know that.
