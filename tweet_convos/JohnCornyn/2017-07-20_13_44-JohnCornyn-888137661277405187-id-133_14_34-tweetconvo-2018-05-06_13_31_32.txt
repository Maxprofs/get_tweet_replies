The American people don't think your secrecy is a "luxury" -- they think it's ludicrous! @JohnCornyn  #ProtectOurCare #VoteNo https://twitter.com/PeterSullivan4/status/888096102318321664 …
#FullRepeal #NoReplacement #FreeMarket #defundpp #UnitedForFreedom
keep whipping gop senate on hcare bill.
NO to trump and Obamacare! #FreeMarketOnly! #UnitedforFreedom!
12 men in a back room sure doesn't sound like honest open debate
Really tired of the secret meetings. Listen to the people who pay ur salary. Or you are fired
#RESISTANCE
It's just math at this point. There's no way for your bill to not kick millions off insurance. Just walk away. Fix ACA and help people pls.
A  budget is kind of like a painting of the future, what we would like to see.
You are a traitor to the American people and texans.  Owned by lobbyists.
It takes courage like John McCain's to work in the future unknown. Use courage to include 100 Senators in solutions, we the people need you!
New poll shows 62% of Americans want federal government to GUARANTEE healthcare for ALL Americans.  GOP is on wrong side of public oppinion.
Crafting legislation, especially healthcare, behind closed doors is indeed a "secret".  Public hearings, open debate, include the Dems too.
Knowing the content of a bill that will affect our lives is not a luxury it's our right.  I bet you know what's in your insurance plan.
John, every newspaper calls you the main shill for #Trumpcare. You don't even care enough abt TX to get some extra $$$ sent our way!
Meanwhile the Pres wants to pardon himself and his crime family and you don't seem to give a shit. No patriotism!
just imagine where we'd be if things were as partisan then as they are now #partyovercountry 
48 years ago today 3 lucky guys were on a journey to be the first humans to land on the moon. #Apollo11 
Quality affordable healthcare is not  a "$12" luxury", it is a right @realDonaldTrump #HealthCareNOTaLuxury #Really?$12Really? #DumpCornyn2!
You have not even tried to actually sell this! One thing in this bill that will be better for most Americans?
It is all secret as you serve Putin/Trump. You want to make sure you're hurting & killing the maximum number of Americans.
Why didn't you start with an open process based on current law (the ACA) and IMPROVE it from there? Instead you "will start" from garbage!
I've seen several things on this new budget. It's no secret. It's all over the place if you'd look.
Maybe the next time you're up for reelection, voting for you isn't a luxury we in Texas have.
You sir are an embarrassment to our once great state. Wtf happened to you that you set out to make sure ppl don't have healthcare FFS?
It's not a luxury to hold meetings & debates about proposals with far-reaching impact. It's how you get the job done. We're watching.

Your "we will not know what's in it" sounds like you took lessons from Pelosi back when 'we the people' were scammed with ACA
Senator, to bet on 250k jobs at the costs of Healthcare is ridiculous. At best they'll be providing services to the 22 million uninsured
Put together a SMART bill, work with Dems, keep process open, let the CBO score it & go from there. The shady, closed door stuff has to go.
Then give public time to review/comment! Why the rush? And if so great, it needs to apply to Congress also. #GOP bill is just plain cruel.
Johnny, face it! This country ain't buying what you're selling!
New revolution brewing. New Tea Party to repeal & replace Do-Nothing Repubs: no HC, no Tax Cuts, no Wall, no support for our President!
Forget that. Come to the party on Trump & Muller & do what's right for the Republic
"Campaign promise" is about the weeniest excise ever.
*excuse. Wtaf autocorrect.
Our vote won't be a secret either!!!!
If it weren't a secret then why the closed doors? You're a liar john.
Why are you still on the Trump Train that's headed for a crash?. We Texans deserve better than a BS talking boot wearer. Vote2018/20
If you think that the public seeing your plan is a "luxury" you are a truly sick and evil man. Slow down and do it the right way

ACTUALLY, @JohnCornyn, 22m people don't have the luxury of waiting around while you decide whether or not to take their health care. #VoteNO 
The people are tired of your lies, John. No one trusts you. Asking us to trust that you'll "fix it later" is shameful.
Vote NO! Fix ACA! See below premiums will rise AND deductibles increase. Older and disabled Texans will be worse off!
I clicked on link, I couldn't find a health bill just more BS. Remember McConnells aide "they wouldn't release the bill they weren't stupid"
Who the hell do u think u r? Who do u really work for? We don't have luxury of letting ppl like u represent us.
How many hearings and town halls did Obama hold when they were working on the ACA? How many has the GOP had?
I am still going to do everything in my power to keep you from getting re-elected.  You don't care in the least about your constituents.
The word "luxury" was your telling choice, Senator.
Please look up the definition of the word "luxury" because it doesn't mean what you think it does, Senator!
You might BS your way through this with the people of Texas BUT 70% of your employers come fro across US and we're not fu**ing happy!
Cornyn supports anything that gives Putin Trump. He always supports the shadows if he can hurt Americans
Cornyn is lying. He has no plans of repealing ObamaCare or cutting taxes. He is a swamp thing.
The people have a right to know what's in this bill!!!!!!!!!
Why do you clowns think you deserve better care than rest of Americans?
Start by putting congress, senate and SCOTUS on same plans as everyone else

Pathetic! Arrogance beyond belief!
It will be no secret to the 13 republicans hiding in a secret room destroying healthcare for millions of people.  #noMorales #noEthics
Who has input into crafting the final version that gets put to vote?
Is there a difference between draft bills and what gets voted on?
Can not wait to see you go. I'll throw a damn party!!!
We want open public hearings on ACA, you work for us!
It’s time for the Senate to go back to regular order.
Your place in history should keep you awake at night.  The bitter taste of your "luxury" comment will follow you for the rest of your life.
GOP senator says public won’t have "luxury" of learning about health care plan before a vote.
No secrets says #cowardcornyn Then why not have a #Townhall?
Another lie from #cowardcornyn and the #partyofliars #partyofTrump. U can't be trusted. You want to kill Medicare. Fix ACA fully fund it!
Freemarket only

I'm looking on this website and don't see it. Maybe you could give a more specific website link?
how long from when it's finalized do U wait 2 vote on it? If U allow enough time for all 2 see it and form critiques of it, then all good
No secret that the GOP shot Obamacare in the head & tried to claim suicide
Only reason U want 2 pass a bill is so Reps do't look like ineffectual fools. That's a lousy reason to rip health coverage from millions.
He's got to go.
Let me guess, the plans will be on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet, in a disused lavatory, with the sign Beware of Leopard.
Sir, and I say this with total respect.  If you, our elected rep, cannot take time to READ a bill & ammeds, why should I trust you.
You better read it before you vote! Need comprehensive women's health care and pre-ex coverage!
Apparently, being the swamp, is the GOP's entitlements.
By the way HHS isn't legitimate
John, I have several contracts for you ro sign. Don't have the luxury of letting you read them.  Call me when you're ready. #nothowitworks
This post was about Health Care way to deflect did you learn it from 45 or was it already part of your repertoire? #KillTheBill #SaveTheACA
As usual, the conservatives rely on government subsidies then paint a picture of everyday people being leeches. You're the leech John.
You want healthcare to be a luxury for the people who pay for your healthcare & you're willing to vote on a bill you haven't read. #typical
why don't you start by admitting your sh*t smells like everyone elses and actually work on a BI-PARTISAN bill
Hypocritical frauds. #DeadOfNight #TaxCutsForRichPricks
Why do you and your co-conspirators hate regular Americans so much?

Trump admin spent taxpayer $$ meant to encourage Obamacare enrollment on PR campaign to kill O'care http://thebea.st/2th6AG1?source=twitter&via=desktop … — via @samstein
And i ask you again, f the ACA is so bad, why are you keeping it for yourselves.
Who can understand all the gobbledygook on ur link. Are u going to have the CBO score it so we can see how awful it is to the public #RESIST
You mean ALL secret, Johnny Boy.  And you don't need an amendment, you need a COMPLETE rewrite.  You failed, start over.
Start with healthcare for ALL, Senator @johncornyn. Americans want & deserve the same healthcare you & your family enjoy - on our dime
https://twitter.com/TopherSpiro/status/888073571993616384 …
 Premiums would rise by $11,000+ for middle income constituents, Senator.
 BREAKING: CBO: Premiums will increase by ***$11,500*** for a 64-year old with middle income  
You're so bad at this, seriously. Everyone hates you. You should resign. Thx. 
Great job, Senator. Somebody making $11,400 in a state that didn't expand Medicaid would have a *$13,000* deductible under BCRA, CBO says.
Do you have any idea what the hell your doing? Cuz it doesn't seem like it.
You should just fix the ACA -- enough of this repeal nonsense.  Obama is no longer the president, just move on for Heaven's sake.
And when will the committee hearings be scheduled?  Who has provided input to the amendments and bills thus far?
The entire process was done in by 12 men in secret ignoring health committee, 40 R sens and all dems. Bad optics lies #sad
#VoteOutCornyn in #2020! #Vote2020 #SaveMedicaid #SaveOurHealthcare
"No secret" is complete and total john Cornyn BS. Anyone who believes that is willfully stupid.  It's all about secrecy-- GOP needs t hide.
You wouldn't buy a  without knowing what's in it. What the hell is different about knowing what's in the awful health care bill? #RESIST

Veterans are speaking out against the Senate #Trumpcare bill which might hurt 1.75 million #veterans and their families #ProtectOurCare 
This Congress and it's leaders are classic examples of why GREAT Democracies always destroy themselves after about 150 to 200 years.

To be clear, Obamacare isn't failing. @realdonaldtrump is sabotaging it. 
Question remains, which one will be brought to the floor for MTP vote?
Healthcare for all. Period.
You guys are doing great.
What have you all been doing for the past 7 years except squealing, whining and crying? BS party of saboteurs. Crybabies
You should start over.
Pass the 2015 bill
No
No secret you and your GOP colleagues are bumbling fools.
