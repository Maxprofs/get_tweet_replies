Lie.
A worse lie than "you can keep your doctor"
Your lie leaves people with NO doctor.
Mr. President, please study the bill carefully. Be sure it offers "better coverage at a fraction of the cost," as you promised your voters.
I doubt he's studied it at all. I think would pass anything now just to be done w/it.
Sadly, you're probably right. I keep thinking people can change. Sigh...

Do you even bother to read bills prior to lying about what is in them? Many of us are literate & actually READ every word for ourselves.

IT'S COMPLICATED  DUH
You. Are. A. LIAR.
Can you read? It allows states to discriminate against folks w/pre-existing conditions. You're a poseur pretending to understand anything
Why is the richest country on earth so greedy not to consider healthcare a right?
You didn't read Don. How do you know? You didn't read the bill or even pat of it
0% chance he read the bill.  It's likely he was half listening to his briefing of the bill.
Me every time you tweet a lie (which is pretty much always).
Liar Liar Pants on Fire. You are just repeating what they told you about it. Not what you read yourself.
It writes out protections for pre-existing conditions elsewhere in the bill. You really should read the bill before promoting it! #NotGreat!
Graham-Cassidy is NOT A GREAT BILL.
This is not true. You will sign anything that undoes @BarackObama policies/accomplishments no matter who it hurts. Stop the deceitful Tweets
It does not!
Thank you Sir. 
And the ability to purchase across State lines?

Liar.
This is a lie.  But if it's so great, why are you offering the Alaskan Senator that her state can keep ACA if she votes for yours?  Ironic?
If that were true then why are the #Medicaid directors of all 50 states against this bill? Including these experts.
#GrahamCassidy targets people with disabilities in every state. It is not a great bill for people with disabilities. #DisabilityRights
but you see POTUS Trump, mccain is one-upping you again to show that his pen is mightier than yours; retire this bum for medical reasons now
YES MCCAIN US 1 UP N POTUS. BUT MCCAIN IS HIS 1 HEAD UP N HIS AS ,
you know what, that could explain the bulge in mccain's cheek!
You haven’t even read it!
At what cost? Not $12 annually! Could you just resign or die? Either is acceptable 
#DotardTrump

Coverage of pre-existing conditions does no good if it's unaffordable. #GrahamCassidy would allow states to jack up rates

Call 202-224-3121 https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/910641701064204288 …
Be honest, you haven't even read it yet.
When #GrahamCassidyBill supporters say those with pre-existing conditions will be covered, technically, they are correct. #BodyBagCoverage
This. Is. A. Lie.
 Even insurance companies acknowledge it is a lie. This new bill is the latest attack on Americans healthcare. #savetheACA
It will literally mean the difference between life and death for both my wife and I. Of course you know that as you are lying
FAKE NEWS from the buffoon that "never thought health care was so difficult". #TrumpLies #TrumpStupidity
Hey #DotardTrump , I have the option to buy an island too but if I can't afford it it's not really an option now is it? #FixACA
Trumpster you will not sign the Bill "if you read it"......what it says and what it allows are 2 major differences!!

Trump lies every time he speaks. A worse liar than Nixon. Far worse.
Just another McCain and Graham gotcha moment Mr. President. You didn't actually believe they had good intentions did you?
Democrat judist McCain
You have absolutely no idea what it does or does not do.
Give him hell froggy!
But here's the thing … it doesn't
You are a #LIAR
Since i doubt if you can read more than a dew simple paragraphs Comrade Trump how do you even know what rhw bill says?
Why must you continue to lie to citizens?
You'd sign anything at this point just so you could say you actually passed something. Yo haven't read it and can't begin to understand it.
No it doesn't. Unlike your minions - not all Americans are idiots.
LIE!!!This bill allow ins. co to charge whatever they want to for pre-existing conditions. If we can't afford it, it doesn't exist!!!
I'm all for Repeal & Replace. Repeal any laws shielding you & your family from prosecution, & and replace you with a human president.
It's not gonna happen. Your presidency has accomplished nothing. Unless you want to count empowering white supremacy. #resist #impeach
...except the state can allow premium hike for pre-existing conditions.  Can't afford it, no coverage. G-C fails.
Doctors say that pathological liars eventually turn orange.
LIAR LIAR PANTS ON FIRE! #factsmatter
Trump Just Tweeted A Very Dangerous Lie About The Senate’s New Trumpcare Bill
You are delusional, seriously ill informed, or a liar. Maybe all three. Sad.
You are a liar. Your excuse for your lies when you are caught is ignorance of the law. Your words mean nothing, you have 0 credibility.
BREAKING: Trump will not sign #GrahamCassidy as soon as he finds out it doesn't protect pre-existing conditions. (Jk, he doesn't give a )
Incredibly misleading: under G-C, providers will charge exorbitant premiums for PEC, pricing those who need it most out--that's not coverage
A great Bill:
I again ask what is your definition of lying? Because you're doing it again. States decide to allow insurance companies to cover/charge
It is certain that you have not only not read #GrahamCassidy but haven't read any of the equally atrocious GOP #Wealthcare bills that failed
How would you know. You never read anything before you sign it.
Except it does NOT include coverage of pre-existing conditions. Gave you even read the bill?
Remember, HIS vows can be trusted!
Liar
You don't read and haven't read the bill. It's horrible.
@LindseyGrahamSC Stand by me & THE PEOPLE. @SenJohnMcCain No, I vote AGAINST THE PEOPLE to suffer ACA while I enjoy BETTER CARE. Sad legacy!
Nonsense
Sadly, Wapo not where I go for information. Believe they backed 44s claim: "If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor - Period.
Put both houses on Obamacare if it's good enough for us it's good enough for them! NO Exemptions!
No it didn't-If you had bother to read the bill you would know this. This would have pushed 32M off health care rolls. How is that American?
Love you Mr. President... You are doing a fine job...
Hopefully Trump will have a heart attack and have no health coverage, it would be 'such' a 'shame'
Fire tom price
It does not you pathological liar
But, you don't read so how would you know?
Giant flipcharts with pretty pictures are just to
keep you happy till your morning poop is done.
You're such a liar!!!
Still No legislation!!! Youre A #BumBitch!!!
And no you’ll never sign it.
I doubt you ever read it. Have you ever tried not lying for an entire day just to see how it feels? Try it you might like it.
I voted for u never again ur sick
Repeal and Replace !! Drain the Swamp
FYI you break it YOU OWN IT!
#plasterSaint
have U read the bill?
many republicans haven't read the bill.
there have been no open committees discussing the bill details.
UR a #failure
#LiarLiar
Lie
Bill allows insurance companies to price based on risk.  Premiums will be based on expected cost of care.  What will a cancer patient pay?
You lie, like always

https://twitter.com/mfpcrules/status/910355504983166976 … save Biafrans from Nigerian army now.@realDonaldTrump @netanyahu @PutinRF_Eng @PutinRF @Plaid_Abe @Plaid_Australia
You capitalize your nouns like your favorite author: Hitler.  Do you still keep a copy of Mein Kampf in your bedroom?
STOP  LYING  TO  THE  AMERICAN  PEOPLE  This is not a joke, it's your JOB. Do it or get out.
Why not actually read it and all fine print before blasting out you blatant lies?  #muellertime #DotardDon
Liar!
I, like many others, NEED this to pass! I havent had coverage since Ocare was passed! @SenJohnMcCain has HIS coverage so he dont care!
You're the literal monster of Americas dreams. I really hope you remember that on your impeachment day.
With every breath you take - you are the biggest mistake! SMH Lying #DonTheCon
and we are all pawns in ur game. You'd sign a bill to put 32+ million at risk as long as u got a 'win' no matter the hurt!
It does NOT require pre-existing coverage. You just tweeted your ignorance! Dumbelievable!
Can we Repeal & Replace you? I mean, before 2020? Asking for a nation. #DonnieDotard
Lies from a lying liar
Bullshit. Try reading the bill. It will depend on what state you live in. God help us all!
It doesn't. I know they told you that but it gives the power to the states. No good.
Well there you go lying again. I  think you have a problem w/ telling the truth. A good psychiatrist could help.#ImpeachTrump #TrumpInsane
GREAT BILL LIKE YOUR TAX REFORM FOR THE TOP 1% , MIDDLE CLASS & POOR PAY YOUR FREIGHT? SCREW US ONCE, TRY AGAIN, & UP YOURS
Then why did Traitor McCain vote against it? Open his sealed file. There's truth there. Please, this is need to know.
Thanks I'm enjoying your great work and true statesmanship you go Mr President we love you and your family
Me. President! Why didn't you remove them from receiving OCare exemptions? Why? @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @FLOTUS @PressSec @CLewandowski_
You can remove my reply ,but I am a constituent of your government also if my opinion differs from yours please enlighten me .
Well carry through and put Congress on ACA now that they're giving McCain the pleasure of shooting it down again @realDonaldTrump
As long as we're not "Replaced". #LockThemUp
Absolutely wrong.  Trumpcare always known as death care. No Health care for 25 millions
Wake Up @POTUS @IvankaTrump THIS WILL NEVER WORK. MANY HOSPITALS WILL CLOSE FROM BANKRUPTCY! #GrahamCassidyDeathBill #GrahamCassidyBill
Rumor has it that it neither Repeals nor Replaces!
It does not so you shouldn't.
maybe u should get some1 else to read the bill for u.  as whoever is reading it to u now isnt doing a good job...
More like Choke and Puke! #ImpeachDonaldTrump #NotMyPresident
Coverage available at premiums average people cannot afford is not coverage. It's a big, fat lie.
You really expect us to believe you? Or expect us to believe you've read it? #idiotinchief
You're willing to sign any health bill that comes across your desk from the GOP without even reading it! What's wrong with you? You suck!
Liar liar pants on fire. THIS IS NOT TRUE. I was going to say and you know it, but maybe you don't. You're not very bright, are you?
.....
One, #TrumpCare would not protect preexisting conditions, another of your lies. Two, #TrumpCareDead!
BALONEY! You don't even know what the bill says!! Read the small print, buddy! You CAN read, can't you?
No it doesn't, it gives the states the ability to essentially bail on pre-existing conditions #smokescreen
#mentiroso
U juz luuuve ACA. But ya hate Obama-care! He he he!!!
seriously? I know I'm stating the obvious here, but it bears repeating - you have truly lost your damn mind.
blatant lie. nothing new.
 fire #JohnMcCain #joh
Please fire him or tell a doctor to tell us he is INCOMPETENT
Everyone else who read the bill knows this is a FALSE statement. An "alternative fact", a LIE
That is a lie! It would hurt all with pre-existing conditions and you know that! You are showing how little you care for our people! Shame!
There is no cost cap for preexisting you lying weasel and you know it people cannot afford
#DumbassDonald f***s up healthcare! Have fun golfing!
Great demonstration of your relationship to truth! #impeach #resist
I hope they have read it, u read it and it really is for Americans. Govt doesnt belong in healthcare except some regulation and ricco laws.
It literally does not.

Clearly you haven't learned comprehension when reading. No it doesn't. Comprehension of you being known as a traitor is a fact and reality
You thought magical health care fairies wrote the bills.
You need to stop #lying
@realDonaldTrump if it's a great bill, YOU get insurance through it
Not like you read it, but it leaves people with pre-existing conditions to the mercy of States and Ins Co high risk pools. BIG FAT LIAR!

You're the leader why don't you hold a press conference and answer questions about this healthcare bill? You know what's in it right?
When did (replace) become a thing. Just repeal it. The Fed should not be in the healthcare business. VA and Medicaid prove that.
A horrible president. Impeach & replace.
A great Bill:
Graham-Cassidy is a disgrace! As are you. Do us all a favor - resign! Today!
This bill does not provide coverage for pre-existing conditions. Therefore if u sign it, u would be making this tweet FAKE NEWS.
Wake up Rand Paul!! If you vote no you will be blocking our only chance to get this nasty Obamacare out of Fed control!
WE THE PEOPLE RGOV KN 2”FAITHFULLY UNINSTALL SOCIALISM FROM USA HEALTHCARE”LONG PROCESS YRS. FINAL OUTCOME WILL SAVE AMERICAN LIFE LIBERTY
@IvankaTrump  Ivanka's post-partum depression is now a pre-existing condition for her. This bill won't guarantee that treatment is covered.
Just another lie from trump, millions are going to lose coverage and our president couldn't care less. #NoGrahamCassidy #SinglePayerNow

You lie.
No, it doesn't. It allows states to decide. #dotarddonald
please read the legislation. it does not. you've been hoodwinked.
That's a lie. Sign-up for healthcare here;
https://www.healthcare.gov/blog/4-ways-to-apply-for-coverage-in-the-health-insurance-marketplace/ …
Did you read it?
Liar.
I suggest you actually read it!  It does not over pre existing conditions period. Just like your inaugural crowd was the biggest ever period
Well it doesn't so don't sign it
It's not a great bill.  It does none of the things you promised except get rid of ACA. It will kill people or bankrupt them or both.
Lunatic 
The only thing Americans and the world wants u to sign is the RESIGNATION LETTER ! Make America Great Again and resign! #ResignTrumpNow
LYING conmandon once an ass always an ass
No. It does not cover pre-exsisting. Many of us will die now.if this happens. Over 32 MILLION PEOPLE will lose coverage. That's insane!!!
We should start pointing out statements of yours that *aren't* lies. It'd save us time.
Greatest Military in the world. Apparently all our helicopters are in the shop right now. Sorry Puerto Rico. #FUT
Trump couldn't find Puerto Rico on a map it's an island surrounded by big water the ocean
Give it up! It sucks just like u!
as if you've even read it. Please
Sitting waiting with your pen are you..... you lost. You will never win at anything loser.
You're a lying sack of shit.   Period.
Article I. Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution delegates no authority to the federal government in the area of healthcare. NO GOVT HEALTHCARE
Mostly False - Trump is not entirely wrong, but his tweet papers over some pitfalls in what the bill offers.
Didn't start or did sign the 1st 1 then say it's a horrible bill? So you're lying 2us again. You don't know anything about it do you?
And you put your name on your school & steaks and they were horrible. So that's another lie to Americans. #Kimmel4President #OutWithTrump
MR.PRESIDENT, with all due respect why are they saying it doesnt? Im a paraplegic i voted for you. Im concerned please confrim
Hmm did you read it? Debate it?
Extol the virtues of this bill...
I dare you
Give us details, your personal insights. Healthcare is no joke!
 @SenJohnMcCain
