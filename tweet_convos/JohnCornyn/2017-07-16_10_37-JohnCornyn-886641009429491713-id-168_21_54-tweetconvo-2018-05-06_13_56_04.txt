Hm. Is @JohnCornyn saying the BCRA can't pass if has no Democratic support? Because it has no Democratic support. 
Just throw in the towel & go with single payer. If u won't, quit sabotaging the ACA & make it better. But u won't since u hate everything O.
It hardly has Republican support. It's DOA. Admit it.
John Cornyn doesn't even support repeal of ACA.
For 7 years you said you had a better plan.   Turns out same rep bs... all you had was hate of the president. 
#LastTermCornyn
The only reason this bill has even a 17% approval is that people don't understand it will gut protection for pre-existing conditions.
The bill sucks. Everyone knows the bills sucks. Even fox.
Oh. You were just looking for a chance to express some partisanship. Neat
@sahilkapur It has very little American support either! John doesn't care as long as him & wealthy R allowed to get richer. Sad!
 @SenTedCruz
Why do you keep lying and distorting the facts? R's are deliberately excludig any D involvement.
It's not because we're listening to critics only.  The GOP is LYING about this bill.  Why do Senate R men hate women so much.

DC is learning that they don't run this ship. The American people do! Get the #FullRepeal. NO to universal healthcare! #UnitedForFreedom!
Curious- your party had 8 years to work w/Dems to improve Obamacare- but refused. Why should they help your party take it away from 23 mill+
The president that you support Tweets, Watches TV all day or travels. Is that making America Great Again?
Keep your promise to #REPEALObamacare completely! #FreeMarketOnly! #UnitedforFreedom!
#FullRepeal #FreeMarket #UnitedForFreedom
We've had ENOUGH of you in Texas!! VOTE NO!!!!
#FullRepeal
#UnitedForFreedom
@sahilkapur Believe McConnell, Cornyn & other sell outs intended to work with Dems all along to give appearance of FIXING OCare!
@sahilkapur I respect Cornyn less every day! Now we see the true R agenda: NO PROMISED REPEAL OF OC & PRETEND to REPLACE!
yes.
you should vote no on the bill on Monday. it is a tax cut for the rich. It surely isn't a healthcare bill to help folks.
You are playing with our lives. Dems should be involved.
obviously the answer was yes. yes yes yes. just because you don't want to doesn't make it so
Just be truthful - you want a complete free market on health care with no protections for anyone
stop blaming the dems. Trumpcare sucks and you know it. I don't know how you sleep at night. never again will the republicans get my vote.
That has been favorite word of GOP, unless it's to wealthy donors, then it's all 'yes.' #Wealthcare has nothing for anyone except wealthy.
Jesus Christ! You're contradictions and hypocrisy are legendary #colludingcornyn Quit selling out the country #trumpfootstoolcornyn
Let's be real, neither Cornyn nor Reps have any plan but to follow through on their unworkable pledge to gut Obamacare, they'll all go down
Dems will help fix healthcare if republicans will let them. Dems know ACA needs tweaking.
Why so grumpy? Rs have control of both houses of congress and the presidency. And the entire state of Texas. It's going great, right?
Then WTF are you saying? Holy crap, man, you are #WorstSenatorEver. #TurnTXBlue #Beto2018
So the dems won't support, if they don't you need to figure out a new plan, but they aren't needed
It has so little support, even the VP is lying -
Democrats have said over and over they would work on reform, but not repeal. Stop trying to gut Medicaid and stop blaming Democrats.
Your TrumpCare bill is dead, John. Terrible legislation plus weak whip = dead. You may not even have the votes to proceed. Sad!
@HouseGOP @SenateGOP 
Dems will never support any format of repeal or repeal and replace. Just repeal the whole thing Stop Digging the hole.
You will be remembered for your work on Trumpcare, John.
If you want Dems to join you, stop trying to line rich people's pockets (with a relatively small tax cut for them) AND SCREW 22M people!!!
Cruz's proposed cheap plans do not qualify as legit insurance coverage under the GOP’s “continuous coverage” rules
How can the the democrats help when the republicans are meeting in secret.  Mr Cornyn you are a morally bankrupt liar!! God is watching you!
FIX it that's what we want lower premiums -- that's an insurance issue!! FIX IT!!
No, it can't pass because members of your own party are against it. And weren't you just complaining about the dems not "helping"?
What process should Ds participate in, sir?
Please expand on NO.  You've got 140 characters so you can do better than that.
Then what are you saying, Senator? Nothing at all?
A new different plan.....?
Do it now, they will never work together
I don't think this BCRA is going to get pass. It doesn't help; makes things worse and gives your pimps even more of my money.
Why can we not have a bipartisan approach??
THE BILLS NOT READY! This is more important than reelection. Think how historic 4 GOP 2 seek Dems 2 create masterpiece 4 us all! Collaborate
People like this 2mouth sided Cornyn will get elected over & over again even if he promises to pull a plug on every one with sickness. Texas
If you were truly the party of fiscal conservatism you'd be passing #MedicareForAll and saving taxpayer $$ by cutting out the middleman.
You all have had SEVEN YEARS to come up with a better plan. YOU FAILED. #Truth
How can Dems help Repubs on BCRA when u go behind locked doors & won't let them n. Stop lying, Dems want 2 save healthcare 4 millions. 3/3
Americans won't b able 2 afford coverage they need. Pre-existing conditions will not b covered, unless u r a member of House or Senate. 2/3
BRCA shouldn't have the support of anyone who cares 4 Americans. U r lying when u say people can choose what coverage they want. 1/3
Looks like how you governed the last eight years as a majority: no. As in no plan, no empathy, no vision.
Why on earth would we bail out insurance companies? Let's try bailing out the American people who need healthcare insurance to live. #FixACA
How are they supposed to participate in the process if you locked them out of the room? Hypocritical.
Have you no shame? Criticizing the Democrats for not helping after you guys spent 8 YEARS not helping Americans get health insurance?! Sad.
..YOU PASS GOP HEALTH BILL, YOU ALL OWN IT & WILL PAY IN THE POLLS. HEY HEY GOODBY
Answer me this @JohnCornyn #HealthInsurance #ACA Why not make deals with insurers in problem areas of US? POTUS says he's a "Dealmaker?"
Does it have anyone's support except for Trump ?
...HEY CHICKEN S...,YOU NEVER ANSWERED TODDS QUESTION-"IS RUSSIA A HOAX?" YOU DANCED,
LIED,FUDGED. GOP IS PARTY FIRST-COUNTRY LAST. LAP DOG!
I totally ignored you on @msnbc. I don't listen to liars.

You didn't allow democrats ANY input or debate with this bill. Are you on drugs?
Enlighten us then, Johnny. 

What DID you mean?
You hid your shameful bill from the Dems and the country and now you blame them for not helping. @GOP games are exposed. Exempting Congress?
Unacceptable senator....THIS IS ABOUT TRUMP AND RUSSIA. Stop lying and do your job. #TrumpRussia
John Cornyn, #2 Republican and Intel Cmte member, won't rebuke Trump for calling Russia probe a hoax, saying he understands his frustration. 
It is a killer bill and no one should think otherwise it's toxic poison Democrats are the party of intelligence obvious
#MakeAmericaLookDumbagain 
Just like gop didnt help in ACA! Stop twisting facts to benefit yourself ir gop
It's a reconciliation so the obstructionist Dems can sit on their "tiny" hands!
I am a low income Texan and I am not interested your repeal and replace.  It is not in the best interest of Texans.
Listening to you lie up a storm on TV.Before one more action is taken we need a Truth In Governing Act making it illegal for you guys to lie
Your lies flow out your mouth so smoothly and effortlessly! Guess that what people mean when they call others a "politician". Shame on you!
The reason it can't pass is because it only has 17% public support
We must stop insurance companies from making billions at expense of sick people. They are just middle men. Patients and doctors are primary.

To be clear, Obamacare isn't failing. @realdonaldtrump is sabotaging it. 
John is salivating for those tax cuts, at expense of 22M Americans losing their health care. Compassionate Conservative!
You didn't even include most republicans
God forbid you should work towards something that could get democratic support. Geez, what a novel idea........
#cowardcornyn is a liar who's not accomplished anything while in office for the people. He's a partyshill getting rich from private donors
Sen, don't you think it would be better if you invited D input into writing the bill?  Secrecy=partisanship=suspicion that it's not good.
Can you explain yet why there are no hearings? What are you afraid of, John?
Dems don't support it because they are not interesting in killing American citizens. The GOP is happy to do so.
We now have Trump Country vs. the rest; you are at the Apex -shame on you for separating your country
John bemoans that the Dems won't help destroy healthcare. Meanwhile, Republicans refuse to protect our elections.
NEWS:

Dems issue a formal request to GOP, asking for united front against Russian sabotage of 2018 elections:

…
How can anyone (including your own party) participate when you drafted the bill behind closed doors?
Jake Tapper just moved on & didn't even challenge your rhetoric this morning. Your interview & stance is an embarrassment to Texans! Shame!
John's support is dependent upon a corrupt GOP, Trump and Putin
No, the ACA had no republican support yet it passed.  No, John just likes to complain about the D's when they behave like the R's.

I expect a 5 yr old to lie but a Senator .... Wait, nevermind you basically are a 5 yr old. Nap time?
"Cornyn also essentially ruled out any bipartisan health care fixes with Democrats"
If you wanted Dems to participate, wouldn't you have meetings or something
It doesn't even have enough @SenateGOP support! @SenDeanHeller @lisamurkowski and @senrobportman are still listening to the #American people
#VoteNoBCRA #VoteNoOnTrumpcare #VoteNo #VoteOutCornyn #vote2020
John, how come you don't respond to you constituents?  Especially on this failed healthcare bill you have exempted yourselves from. Explain.
Congrats on the 28 percent approval rating. It's well deserved.
28% is high for how low Cornyn goes. It will get even lower after his interview today. Lies, lies, lies. The people are on to the lies.


You are so far out of touch with what your constituents want, John. Can't wait to see you ousted from office.
don't understand why, if this proposed legis is subject to reconciliation constraints, GOP isn't talking abt this as Phase 1?
So you're saying YOU won't participate in a bipartisan process. That's what we thought.
I thought you whined that Democrats didn't want to work with you.
Cornyn says a lot of things. We know not to pay too much attention anymore.
@sahilkapur how about working together, if our obstructionist president will quit mudding the water @MSNBC @indivisibletxjc
Then where was the bipartisan support in drafting the bill which will affect ALL Americans, not just Republicans?

Health care access affects an entire community. Wes lays out #Trumpcare's disastrous impact. http://sen.gov/LZ4K  #AmericaSpeaksOut 
Then, really Johnny, what R U saying? Asking for a state!

Also, your voice mail is full of messages against Trumpcare. Answer your damn phone and answer your constituents.
No hearing.No debates.Closed door bill drafting.

You forfeit the right to bitch about folks who weren't allowed to participate.
You are such a failure politically, morally, spiritually...
