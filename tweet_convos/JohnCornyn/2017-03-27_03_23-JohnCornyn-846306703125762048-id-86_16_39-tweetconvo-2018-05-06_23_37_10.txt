Re: Hatch - 'What do you call a senator who's served in Congress for 40 years? You call him home.'
.@JohnCornyn @OrrinHatch @WSJopinion Merrick Garland would agree! GOP obstruction shamed the Senate then and led to this situation now.
- Hypocrisy. What's embarrassing is selective memory re: Merrick Garland. That was straight up abrogation of your const duties
In order to build a team, or a position, LEADERS do not engage in this manner. You lack leadership skill
At your age @JohnCornyn if you don't have leadership skills, you will never acquire them.
Huh!  Our senate is so blatantly embarrassing that I'm sure they're embarrassed of nothing!!
can't have it both ways Johnny Boy..i think he would do a great job...but you know what they say, what's good for the the goose
and you all embarrass the country
#trumprussia is REALLY EMBARRASSING for CORRUPT @GOP.
INDICT @jaredkushner GRAFT COLLUSION
#resist
OMG! Questioning him on his previous rulings?? How dare a SCOTUS nominee be questioned like that!

Get a grip.
It is impossible to overstate the gravitas w/which these decisions should be made.Gorsuch isn't Jesus.  You're better than this
you are both hypocrites. #MerrickGarland was YOUR choice to blow up SCOTUS. #PostponeGorsuch
Agree @JohnCornyn @OrrinHatch or if @POTUS really wants to "extend the Olive Branch" nominate #MerrickGarland
Quite like the way GOP embarrassed the Senate by refusing to hold hearings for Garland. Hmmm...
This is rich. Your POTUS embarrasses this nation daily.
by the way, I'm glad to see that Twitter exposes U for the empty suit party hack you are.  Have U ever had an original thought?
Seriously?  Well GOP hypocrisy on the subject of Supreme Court nominations embarrasses the whole countryâ€¦ @JohnCornyn @OrrinHatch
Are you all not the least bit embarrassed over your hypocrisy? The @GOP needs him in just so you can claim a win.

@indivisibleATX We the people demand Gorsuch confirmation and all others must stop until Independent investigation completed!
Obama's 'lame duck' appt? You're kidding. 45 under current FBI invest, tell me that's not 'lame'. Shameful hypocrisy
Hey, just like Garland foes!
If it's an embarrassment now, it was an embarrassment when you blocked Merrick Garland. No vote into an independent commission--
--investigates ties to Russia.
you can't have it both ways. If Obama couldn't nominate in his last year as potus, neither can Donald.
Gorsuch's biggest fault is that he's not Merrick Garland. Postpone the vote until Russia inv complete.
