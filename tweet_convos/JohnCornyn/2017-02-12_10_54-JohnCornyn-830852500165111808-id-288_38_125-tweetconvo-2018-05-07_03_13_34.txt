There's an understatement. Disheartening to hear @JohnCornyn defending the Muslim ban. Not @Trinity_U values, Senator. https://twitter.com/thehill/status/830818772546154496 …
do you not read POTUS's tweets? Should I believe you or my lying eyes? He called it a BAN!
@indivisibletx03 @JohnCornyn  Save your breath. Cornyn doesn't care about Texans. All he cares about is his own power.
the republican administration is figuratively covering  eyes & ears. You'd think they don't care  @lynnfromnyc @JohnCornyn
They don't care.  GOP = Grab Onto Power. Cruz is up in 2018. Let's at least get rid of him
.@BrokenLiberal @indivisibletx03 @lynnfromnyc @JohnCornyn There plenty of Dem voters in TX to get rid of Cruz in a midterm - IF WE GOTV
@SenTedCruz  Damn straight!!  Just look at what Harris County did in 2016!
I am a constituent and I am not falling for the lies & racism you endorse and proliferate. #BeAmericanFirst #Republicans4Russia
The man who issued it is calling it a ban and defending it as such. Take the lobby money out of your ears and listen to reality.
where did the order state Muslims. Some including the councilman need to read the facts before opening their pie hole.
Only country pause? WTH is that? Of course it was a ban. He claimed it was multiple times. Please start listening to the people.
45 consistently calls it a ban...as does his team.  You are picking the wrong horse defending this.  #delusional
you know @realDonaldTrump called it a Muslim ban on twitter, right?
Except that the president himself called it a ban... Those FACTS just seem to get in the way, don't they?
And Clinton  Obama said it was a video that caused Benghazi.  hmmmmmm Where was your outrage over words then Acuff?
The exploitation of Benghazi by the @GOP is a shameful chapter in Republican history.
Demanding the truth and the prosecution of those responsible aka Hillary Clinton & Obama is not exploitation.
Where was the prosecution of GWBush for the thousands who died on 9/11 because warnings were ignored?
STOP SUPPORTING TRUMP!!!   Stop now!     Enough.
excuse me, sir, but BULLSHIT
pls use accurate words when you represent Texas. It was a ban.
Trump &Giuliani both said Muslim ban. The basis of why 9th Court kept freeze intact--Donald's own words in campaign.
I vote and you're my Senator but not much longer.
Country pause? Let's get out of the making up words business. It makes you sound foolish. Are you a fool?
#Alternative words to go with #Alternativefacts
A rose by any other name is still a rose - same goes for the Muslim ban.
Bull$hit!!
So why did President Trump call it a Muslim Ban? 
Then why do Americans have to rely on @ACLU to defend our constitutional rights against #unfit Trump administration? #DoYourJob
then why have such an order?  Just do the vetting and trust Tillerson and Kelley to manage it.
Indivisible is not a paid movement. We are in all 36 TX districts. Keep underestimating us. @IndivisibleTeam #standindivisible
and we are watching your every move sir
Yes we are...
@IndivisibleTeam Deep in the heart of Texas, we had nearly 200 people at our kickoff meeting, and over 700 in our group in just 3 weeks! 
Don't forget PSR of Texas too! We will not go away and we are not paid!
you are correct it was determined to be unconstitutional and the judges banned the ban. Then trump want to go to court, slowly
I know Texas likens itself to a separate country, but even here, the word "ban" means "ban"
We aren't blind to implicit discrimination. Texans aren't stupid.
yeah keep telling yourself that, 3-0 #DumpTrump #FakePresident ur next...
even if his intent weren't to target Muslims, which it is, banning based on nationality has not been allowed since 1965.
that is the word used by POTUS.
@sterlace_fran @JohnCornyn Never had my vote - never will. But btw Muslim ban and DeVos support, I think he's in trouble.
Correct - no Muslim ban - for now.  The courts have struck down the Muslim ban.  Let's hope it stays struck down.
We will remember your stance on this issue in 2020. I am a constituent in the 10th district. When is your next town hall?
@PhilipTKingston @Trinity_U country pause sounds lk a way 2 b mean to refugees. These people r n process for 2 yrs. Let 'em n
@PhilipTKingston @Trinity_U True, it's not a Muslim ban but it certainly should be!
Not even that, since it was ruled un-Constitutional.
@PhilipTKingston @Trinity_U Canadian Muslim from Quebec questioned about religion, phone searched, and denied entry. Muslim ban!
So there is no religious test component to the ban? Either you are lying or the EO is.
Makes exceptions for Christians and other minority religions. Badly implemented. Great recruiting material.
a "country pause" that will continue to cost lives. Obama got us in this mess. Will R Congress help victims of our inept policy?
1) @POTUS called it a Muslim ban, & it is. 2) If it's abt safety why isn't Saudi Arabia on the list? 3) It makes us less safe.
oh, and where can I get paid for my time and effort protesting your recent decisions? DeVos/Sessions/etc. Phone # or email addr?
Giuliani called it a ban. Spicer called it a ban. Trump called it a ban. Ergo, it's a damn ban. Unconstitutional. #indivisible
when will more countries be added to the ban?
the ban disproportionately affects Muslims. Would you also call the indefinite halt of Syrian refugees a 'pause'?
the Prez, Spicer, Giuliani have ALL CALLED IT A BAN. You need to clean your ears. Also where's my town hall? #txdistrict10
good doublespeak. We just don't get it.
LOL, sure a "country pause" except for Christians in those  countries, but not other oppressed minorities. #NoBanNoWall #resist
It's an unconstitutional ban on people who have already been vetted extensively. #NoBanNoWallNoRaids #resist #wheresmypaycheck
there isn't a Muslim Ban.
..Ha! Guiliani gave you up. You're on the wrong side of history. You know it.
there are a number of ways to effectively defend the executive order. Playing word games will not be one of them.
you do know #45 called it a ban, right? And it did, in FACT, block lawful residents from entering the country, right?
Considering the President himself calls it a ban, I'm wondering whether you read what he writes. #notapaidprotestor
Christians are specifically exempt from the Ban. That's a Muslim Ban.
Why don't we have a town hall to discuss? If it looks like a ban, sounds like a ban, and acts like a ban, it's a ban.
Tell that to Fatemah Shams, Tara Sepehrifar,Masih Alinejad, Mohammed Al Rawi ... this was designed for cruelty & chaos.
12/7/2015 Trump promised "..a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States."
"Country pause?"  Is that like the "brain pause" you had while writing this?
semantics vs. reality and intent. I believe the latter two trump the first. You are smarter than this. [image: @PolitiFactWisc]

Statement on Preventing Muslim Immigration: https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-statement-on-preventing-muslim-immigration … 
and their is no racial profiling only random circumstance??
if it is a protestors loved one they would change their tune
I don't care what you call the ban it is not worth the life of anyone's loved one to sit and do nothing
are they willing to put their children mom or self ar risk going to show or mall or movie over strangers
how do these watch the news with dead and hurt people here from foreign people and not get it
the countries that are being watched have said they are coming in bad people through Mexico and borders around USA
do they not understand countries send the people here that have caused trouble in own country
I am having a hard time figuring out why people are upset trying to keep country safe most people lock there doors
#votehimout2020
trump calls it a muslim ban, it's a muslim ban.  y not ban ppl coming from white countries or saudi arabia w/ KNOWN TIES to 9-1?
hire the same person answering @Wendys tweets? Big difference-Wendy's actually gives a shit about the customer unlike you. #2018
Shame on you for defending the Muslim Ban. Trump said he would ban Muslim's before he took office. #2018iscoming #Ivotebutnot4u
92% of world's Muslims not excluded, 10% of Syria's Christians not exempted & conversion will not evade Exec. Order
ironic that christians from these countries can get in but not Muslims.  What do you call it then?
a "country pause" is hanging out and drinking lemonade with muslim neighbors
We support you John.
just as the GOP claims Price introducing legislation on stocks he owned wasn't immoral bc it wasn't technically illegal. #sad
45 called it a ban.  Maybe you should pay attention.  Take care of your constituents, who include many immigrants from all over.
just stop. I doubt you are even buying your own BS. It's a Muslim ban. You know it. We know it. It's ridiculous to deny it.
Administration's motives clear in public statements. I have now lost hope that you are not complicit in this national disgrace
Trump called it a Muslim Ban. Are you calling @realDonaldTrump a liar?
targeting Muslims makes it a Muslim ban. Your leader wants to give priority to Christians.
this is literally the dumbest thing I've heard all day. Are you sure you are a lawyer?
@tedcruz Your constituents demand a #TownHall
these people should invite them to their house without asking any questions.
https://youtu.be/SOs4WUr7sJg 
a travel change that stops 88.5% of all Muslim refugees & only 2.7% of refugees from other religions is a#MuslimBan @SenSanders
on specifically Muslim countries where there are not Trump hotels. Defending this on twitter isn't your job. Stop losing focus.
@PhilipTKingston @Trinity_U I support John Cornyn! 
"Travel Ban" and "country pause" are just "politically correct" ways of saying "Muslim Ban"
Please come home & hold some town hall meetings so you can discuss this with Texas voters.
@PhilipTKingston @Trinity_U The Republican administration repeatedly called it a Muslim ban.
but why were people who have already been vetted detained and why isn't Saudi Arabia on the list?
A pause for what? Why weren't all Muslim countries on the list? You have evidence of terror attacks from any nation in the list?
Also, 90 day "pause" locking people out of country means lost jobs, lost houses, lost cars, family separation.
Let's not return to 1930s. If ban was intended to be temporary, Trump would not have harped on it for a year before election.
Then why does the administration keep using the word "ban" Senator?
just keep telling yourself that. No one believes you. You are disgraceful
BS
if not a ban, why a preferential treatment for Christians? Hmmm. Sounds like a ban to me. Good try though
why didn't he ban refugees from Saudi Arabia? B/c there's a trump tower there?!  15 of 19 9/11 terrorists from SA but no ban?!
as a former Texan and the mother of a Texan, this tweet makes me ashamed.
oh my gosh !  Get your act together man!
oh please! Fine, call it what you will, it's still nothing more than fancy bigotry.
#AnswerYourPhone
if its not a Muslim ban, it's the groundwork for it. This type of immigration policy is not the right thing to do
your president his team called it a ban
And only fast-track is for refugees who helped the US in the past
.@AllAreStarStuff @JohnCornyn And only fast-track is for humans who helped the US in the past #HumanCrisis
But write a new EO which excludes residents and work/student visas who have ALREADY BEEN VETTED.
If you want to revamp our current vetting process, which takes 17 steps over 2 years and allows <1% through, fine.
@PhilipTKingston @Trinity_U If truly about safety he'd have included S.Arabia - country where most 9/11 terrorists came from.
Try reading the Koran. 109 passages refer to violence toward any non-muslim. Arguing over terminology obscures the real problem
Muslims are not our friend. A Muslim ban would be appropriate.
@PhilipTKingston @Trinity_U John, U know it's a Muslim ban prez. is using 2 feed his fear agenda. Pls. stop playing games w/us.
kant wait for ur reelection bid. VOTE U OUT
Well said, Senator
@PhilipTKingston @Trinity_U Your lie, tell it how you want. Kind of like tax funded segregation as School Choice.
.@JohnCornyn PAH-leeze! 9/11 killers from Saudi; Boston killers from Russia. Neither on list. TRUMP HAS EXPLICITLY SAID MUSLIM BAN
keep telling yourself that. Maybe you'll even start believe that lie.
only uninformed people could really call this a Muslim ban!
Actually there is neither -- only a poorly written EO deemed unconstitutional
Philip Kingston is repeating false talking points
wow. Your bosses keep calling it a ban. Thought you were in board with singing the party tune. Answer your phones!!!!
"country pause" Is that the latest propaganda spin now? Could you put out a bulletin each day so we can keep up? Thanks.
So who is planning to run against this guy at the end of his term? Let's all focus our energy voting out John Cornyn.
Get out of weeds/ 2018 you may or may not hold Majority, so work hard & fast pass all in 6 months !  Urgent
Senator, please. Giuliani let the cat out of the bag on that. Please don't dirty yourself apologizing for Trump.
You lack the moral courage to stand up for what is right.  So sad to see how weak the Republicans are.
Are you & your fellow Repubs unaware of how you look to the world? Weak! This looks like you are laying the groundwork for war.
really, OK, called a Muslim Ban by admin over and over, but now you are changing your tune.  Please take a look for your morals.
@PhilipTKingston @Trinity_U so #muslimpause, not #MuslimBan
yep.
@PhilipTKingston @Trinity_U so you finally speak on the #immigration do. In support of? #MuslimBan
You call it a "pause". Seems a pause requires a time limit with at least an effective date and express terms. It's a ban.
We get u r  kissing the ring. U r up for sale.And this tweet shows us u r desperate 4 attn & u want to piss off ur constituents
the president himself called it a ban. It gave special provisions to those not Muslim. Stop insulting our intelligence.
The #MuslimBan is a Muslim ban, which violates the Establishment clause of the Constitution.
don't kid yourself. TRUMP called it a Muslim ban!!!  We ALL know what it is!!!!!!!
@PhilipTKingston @Trinity_U - All of us need 2 #defend #USA as defend our #home. #NoBan. #ExtremeVetting - making sure - is good
Crazy statement when courts disagree. You're not looking for job security or constituents approval sticking w/administration huh
you towing the line makes you a party stooge. But if you truly believe it then you're an ignorant bigot. Either way you look bad
1. Trump called it a ban 2. Priority for Christians. What did they sell you for your morals/ respect for religious freedom?
who are you kidding?
the president called it a ban?
Then why are christians not targeted when leaving these countries?
Except for the fact that President Trump has repeatedly called it a ban.
why did Trump call it a Muslim ban? And we are letting in the christians from those places. 
...while we ban Muslims including legal residents with green cards and work visas being held/detained & kept from their families
Need to review definition of BAN. Means to prohibit especially by legal means. Sounds like BAN is correct!
stop the rhetoric senator...a Muslim ban is called a Muslim ban because it is a Muslim ban! Country pause! Outrageous!
@PhilipTKingston @Trinity_U sure Johnny Boy. Sure.
@PhilipTKingston @Trinity_U ah trying out for an SNL skit?
The so-called president called it that himself. #AlternativeFact -a Constituent/not paid
You should probably let Trump know this. He's called it a ban 1,000 times. Maybe you didn't get the memo. @JohnCornyn
When is a ban a pause? When you say so? Proverbs 16:18. They can take it to #SCOTUS or rewrite the EO.
@PhilipTKingston @Trinity_U there is no ocean; only land pause
why not try a different approach: comprehensive immigration reform! 44 & 43 requested Congress to work on it. Need mote decades?
playing the alt-fact game now, huh?  And you wonder why your constituents have a yuuuuuge grassroots movement against you.
you should really talk to @potus about that, it is what he calls it. Make it illegal to ban on religion, you can do that.
@PhilipTKingston @Trinity_U I'm beginning to believe @JohnCornyn doesn't care what his constituents want.
all he cares about is the @GOP agenda and not the country!
#lies #conspiracies #sensationalism
why is the ban only primarily muslim countries, that Trump has no financial dealings with, that have no history of US terrorism?
then why did Donald calm it was one? Don't fall for that horse shit John. You will be held accountable for your votes! #resist
Stop it. Meet your constituents. It is a religious preference and you know it. Ask Giuliani. Republicans are afraid of so much!
This is going to be your legacy. What you will be remembered for. Your children will be humiliated in years to come.
"only country pause" is a benign sounding less overt version of Muslim ban but the same thing.
Keep lying for your party.
Not surprising.  He rubber stamps everything 45 does. Doesn't care what his constituents want.  #cornynboughtandpaidfor
You are correct about the first part of your statement, thanks to our judicial branch!
Then why does #Trump keep calling it a #MuslimBan? #liar #Republicanslie #wehaveeyes #NoBanNoWallNoRaids #ResistTrump
A wolf in sheep's clothing is still a wolf.
Federal judges appointed by Bush 43 disagree. Candidate Trump cited shutdown of Muslims.
Immigration and Homeland security are excellent topics for a #TownHall.
I don't believe you, can you provide proof?
Count me among your constituents who disagree. Have called your offices many times in last few wks.
Understand that we are voters and potential donors who may have underparticipated in the past, but no longer.
Stop trying to rationalize unconstitutional BS. When will you bother to stand up for American values?
is that what we are calling it this week? Wish the GOP would make up its mind on what to call its Muslim ban
This flub is easy for you to fix. Make a public statement that you support Muslims in Texas and decry religious discrimination.
use whatever semantics you want... the goal is to unconstitutionally block an entire religion from entering our country
supporting this unstable @potus and his policies will cost you your seat.
