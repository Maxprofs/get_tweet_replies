You keep quoting this rag as if it has something interesting to say. It doesn't. Quit trying to confuse Rice doing her job w/Trump's crimes!
any comment on Syria's sarin gas attack yesterday that killed at least 72 people (mostly kids)? Or nah?
The so-called white hats in Syria have posted many staged videos such as this. Is this another one of their fake news stories or is it real
looks pretty real. Watch the video:
Well you're clearly more racist than 
competent
once again you show you are aligned with a corrupt administration.
Y'all r trying to deflect from real story w/Rice. U haven't yet expressed any outrage over Flynn, Trump, Page, etc. Hypocrite! #TrumpPutin
Investigate Russia
Just stop with this #SusanRice crap, we all know it's smoke/mirrors. You're embarrassing yourself. 

She wasdoingherjob!
.@JohnCornyn  Interesting...I wonder how many in that press corps would be as sanguine if their anonymous sources were "unmasked"...
Shocking that you post an ed-op as if it were fact! Nah, just kidding, this is exactly what we expect from you. #KickHimOut2020
You are an nasty man and have no proof she did anything wrong you may want to shut up
She is a serial Liar! Her husband is an ABC News Producer!
@JohnCornyn u r not helping yourself with the moderates the great state TX
Unmasking is not leaking-you promote a false narrative to distract from the true #TrumpRussia complicity-we are not stupid.
Are you equally concerned with the current president colliding with Russia?
