Just like Cornyn abandoned his constituents.
2/2. Today, I'd think you have bigger things to worry about.  Time to FINALLY put country before party.  Fire Sessions.  78704
glass house, senator. ALL representatives should start listening to their constituents.
The country hasn't been "enduring the demonstrations." The country is who's out demonstrating.
and you Sen abandoned TXNS and your sworn duty to serve us.Won't meet or answer phones. SESSIONS treason?  YOU?
we call that leaving the herd on a stormy night or lack of character.

, @WSJ , nothing to say about Sessions?  Russian involvement with this administration should be top priority for all patriots.
#Resist Your party abandoned America for 8 years as your party blocked and obstructed.  Dishonest.
You John Cornyn have abandoned the citizens of Texas.
OMFG! Jeff Sessions is in bed with the Russians and you are turning a blind eye! #DoYourJob
John won't meet with constituents, voicemail full for months but cashes his government check

And meanwhile, you abandon your bosses (remember, that would be us, the citizens of Texas)
the bigger concern is Jeff Sessions
You need to be thinking about repealing Obamacare and tax-relief legislation, not the dems
- Why are u posting obsessively about Dems these days? News flash: GOP holds the power ... and the RESPONSIBILITY. Investigate
Excellent point!
They abandoned the ship of hate.
we don't support #traitors
if you want democrats to reach across party lines, posting offensive articles like this is the WRONG strategy!
interesting to see what you're not posting this morning...
There are more Republicans pushing for investigation on #Trumprussia hen you may think, & you are not offering olive branch
Bigger problem: GOP needs to call for Sessions' resignation.
Stop worrying about the Dems! It makes you look bad, especially when you cry about them not working with you.
What about Sessions, John? Don't you think now is the time to call for him to recuse himself from the Russia investigations?
What, are you worried the Dems are going to behave like the #GOP have for the last 8yrs? @JohnCornyn @DanHenninger @WSJopinion @WSJ
, your political, partisan attacks indicate worry. Voting you OUT! #ImpeachTrump #FireSessions @TX10Indivisible @IndivisibleTeam
.@lLucylLaVern And he's never there for constituents. I have called his Dallas office and no one ever answers. We wont forget  @JohnCornyn
@IrwinJames327 these guys have been in sooo long they think they own the job they are elected to do
As an openly vote suppressing racist, Sessions shouldn't have even been there in the first place. This is on you.
