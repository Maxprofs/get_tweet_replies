just get back to doing your job of representing ALL of your constituents.
yes! So far we are still living in Obamas economy. #ThanksObama! Now Trump will destroy it.
#ThankyouObama
Dow  148% under Obama.
Dow  1.6% under Trump.
And the bond market?
but they want elderly people to pull out of safe bond markets and into high risk pools... so wham!!!! Crash!!
Dow Tripled under Obama ... but don't let facts get in the way of your Republican rhetoric, @JonCornyn .
the Dow went from 9139 (day after Obama elected in 2008) to 18363 the day defore 2016 election. Roughly 100% gain.
It will come crashing down with the economy as a result of the policies of the administration you support.
You need to thank Obama too. Oh wait, you're a partisan hack. Never mind.
#AmericaFrist @JohnCornyn didn't display any happiness when stock market went up 235% during @BarackObama as @POTUS?
#AmericaFirst @JohnCornyn is so proud of the first #Black @POTUS @BarackObama for establishing a strong #foundation?
It's been up! Why can't your constituents contact you? Why are you avoiding us? No one answers your phones. Office is empty.
@deejay90192   HELLOOOO!!!!!
Appreciate your kind words about @BarackObama.
We thanks @POTUS44 @BarackObama for #dow20k he saved the banks, auto makers, lowered unemployment. Trump says his election fraud
These numbers mean nothing when we die. How about human decency? Respect for women? Am I supposed to be impressed?
Thanks Obama.
the Market did great under Obama as well, u just chose not to notice.
yeah... except for my county, but who cares about my county, right?
Yet, the spirit of American Democracy is down!  Shame on you!
You can thank President Obama! Up 200% under his leadership.  You're welcome. #ThanksObama
@datrumpnation1  Whoo-hoo! #TrumpEffect in full effect! 
You are such a partisan hack hypocrite.  Seriously.
, and the president @realDonaldTrump still hasn't stopped lying about various issues. Suggest a psychiatric evaluation for him!
And what percentage is it up since the Republican induced crash of 2008? SAD!
It seems like you are grasping for ways to legitimize Trump. The largest protest in US history should make you pause.
Thank you, Obama, for leaving us with a great economy, before Trump destroys it!
I want to see President Trump's taxes
#TrumpTaxReturns
that is 30% attributable to a jump in goldman stock, because investors think theyre getting back on the 2007 fraud gravy train.
Stock market can also plunge rapidly
ah, the sharks circle they smell blood.
only 12,000 more points to go to equal the Obama market!
U forgot to congrat Prez Obama Mrkt still his not The Donald's Not yet&btw put Senator in ur twitter name so we all know who u r
cornyn, while you play on twitter your potus has lost his fucking mind.
this has nothing to do with trump. This comes from the policies under the Obama Administration.
Funny -- why did you never tweet this when the Dow went from rock bottom under W to sky high under Obama?

Yes. Returning to stable/status quo after 8 years was good. Sky rocketing and breaking records is even better.  
Thanks Obama for the 166% it went up before Election Day!
and up from 6500 where your Texas pal W left it in early 2009
Celebrate the #DowJones while you allow our education system to flounder.  Invest in our children first.
For Trump to replicate Obama's record (2.5x increase in stock market), DJI would have to reach 50000.

Thanks, Obama.
White people must be feeling super cozy rn what with all the trump bullshit and isolationism. So inspiring.
Yes! #ThanksObama for leaving the country in such great shape for all Americans. You're move...
But the Economist Intelligencer downgraded our democracy from "full" to "flawed". This is your legacy.
Yes Johnny, I join u in saying: THANKS OBAMA!!!!!
MONKEY SEE, MONKEY DO
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan the Dow  was up 120% in the 8 years before @realDonaldTrump's election. #ThanksObama
thanks Obama!
And that is a reflection of Obama's economic policy. Trumps has not taken effect yet...you might know that if u read
here are some real facts for you, Dow was up 139% over Obama's 2 terms. I can't find your congratulatory tweets for that...
It better not go backwards after all the hard work Obama and Democrats accomplished through auto bailout and recovery act.
Thanks President Obama for seeing us through the disastrous GOP economy that started in 2008. You are amazing!
@samsteinhp @JohnCornyn, can you run the stock market numbers since @BarackObama's first inauguration? Are the numbers good or bad?
Respectfully, do you think that we are all stupid? Please research the equity market history from 3.9.09 to present & be amazed.
what's your point? Dow has been trending up since Obama turned the economy around.
then why aren't they creating jobs or increasing salaries so workers can take advantage of 401k increases? #ItsAllAboutTheRich
Typical GOP BS, always trying to take credit for something you had nothing to do with. SAD!
How about taking credit for the 43,000 ppl that you R threathening with death on yearly basis with a fake repeal & replace plan
thank-you President Obama
Everyone was celebrating the lucrative stock market before Oct. 24th 1929 too.
 You smell of DESPERATION you fucker
DJIA went up 148% under Obama and 226% under Clinton, but glad you're finally paying attention.
GOP had little to do with this. You’ve been a genuine disgrace to this nation for years, Cornyn. I only mean that sincerely.
LOL. Y'all haven't even done your damage yet, so chill. This economy is still Obama's.
Thanks, Obama!
you hypocrite.
now you like the stock market?
that's when life began for you?
Is this your first stock market tweet in 8 years?  Because you missed the last 166%.
Awesome, now demand Trump prove he isn't hiding anything.  It's time for him to release his taxes!
I guess that’s good news for… Billionaires
Let's hope that you continue to watch the financial markets all four years
Senator, the market is speculative, show me employment, salary and cost of living figures that's what matter to Americans
But the Dow is up 205% since March 2009- don't be myopic.
It doubled during Obama''s presidency. Wake us up when it hits 40,000. And when the poor get to share in the wealth.
As your constituent, I am watching to see what you and @tedcruz and @RepMcCaul do to ensure that no Texans are left behind.
*hint* NOTHING!
Economy still Obama's.Trump hasn't strangled it yet. Rich will be fine, but poor will suffer from bad air and contaminated water
Why did you ever oppose @realDonaldTrump? Support Trump.  Now I'm watching. I give big money. Look at @OpenSecretsDC
Looking forward to seeing how you'll work to put US economic success to work to protect our most vulnerable members of society.
If u mean the 1%, they're on it . . .
Will you be tweeting market updates on a regular basis?
And yet tariffs are on the table?  C'mon. You're smarter than that.
Good job #Obama !!!!
Good lord, THIS... is YOUR barometer? Then, this must make you the biggest Obama supporter ever, right?
