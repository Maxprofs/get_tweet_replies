@FEMA tells me Texas @GovAbbott refusing 2 give $500 CRITICAL NEEDS ASSISTANCE 2 TEXANS/SAYS IT COMES FROM TEXAS NOT @FEMA GIVES ME HEADACHE

R’s just voted for 1.5 trillion more debt, 500 B in Medicare cuts, 1 Trillion in Medicaid cuts. All so 5,000 people pay zero in estate tax.
Texans have a right to boycott and receive hurricane relief
America First means just that-   not Israel 1st.  Divided loyalties cannot stand. The more we 'bless' Israel, the worse things get 4 USA.
Do I have to get down on one knee or both knees & pledge fealty to Israel bofore being considered for assistance?
Whose country is this anyway????
Governor please assist those who are incarcerated Peace
Boycotting boycotts .... 
Is that not just a tad hypocritical? 
Wonder did Moses have a clause parting the Red Sea?
You are a tyrannical governor. What's the heck a hurricane relief has to do w/ Politics. You sold America to Zionist. You need to step down.
Looks like good program! Make sure illegals don't sign up & get relief! It's past time the state-sponsored Gravy Train for illegals ENDS!
We WOMEN ARE TIRED OF FEARING FIGHTING BOTH GOVERNMENT & PEDOFILES TO SAVE OUR CHILDREN
No matter how you got into office...gerrymandering.. and you are up for reelection in 2018?? One term gov is embarrassing.. just saying

The city of Dickinson, Texas is requiring people applying for Hurricane Harvey aid to promise not to boycott Israel. This is unconstitutional.

Gary Cohen admitted today some in middle class might actually see tax increases.they will see pinch when they don't limit unskilled workers
GOP tax plan hurts police ,fireman dea border controls military vets elderly widowers
Listen to America's Mayor - Sylvester Turner - hopefully your replacement
Some people just don't want FEMA in their personal business when it comes to how much they make........so they won't ask! #Harvey
WHERE IS ALL OF THE MONIES RAISED FROM ALL OF THE FUNDS FOR HARVEY VICTIMS? THERE WAS ENOUGH MONEY RAISED TO BUY ALL OF THEM NEW HOMES!

Million of dollars donated for people of houston, jj watsove 30 Mill, Red Cross-Mill, City of Houston -mill, where did that money go?????
You are useless stop kissing trumps a s

Trump wants to eliminate the federal program that oversees long-term hurricane relief http://bit.ly/2xiHrjj 
Why does the #Government Seed these Hurricanes & StormsFor #PopulationControl & bring in the #NWO. I you guys #Freemasons #SkullAndBones
Instead of using our tax dollars to help Americn victims of hurricanes Lindsey Graham gives $75 million of tax $$ to ISRAEL! #Harvey #Irma

CALL TED CRUZ TO CHECK HIS TWITTER ACCOUNT NOW! THANK YOU!

Doing ANYTHING about the cause? Who pays for worse storms, the polluters? This is just the beginning...wake up or go home...
Need some help now Gov?
Mr. Governor, please help us in West Houston Energy Corridor residents! We have lost power for 10 days! Thank you!
need of the day - plant 1 bn trees by hiring people of Houston and pay them by the hour
http://hurricaneclaim.org  

Just remind everyone that in May you signed something that makes it harder for homeowners to collect on damage
As Harvey hit, TX Gov. Abbott relaxed the TX Comm on Envirmntl Quality's requirements 4 "Emissions Event Reporting"
Texas has plenty of its own money to help the victims of the flood
is a corrupt corrupt corporate man
DID YOU HUG A DACATONIAN & OFFER THEM RELIEF?  HOW ABOUT "ADOPT A DACA" OR A GRANDFATHER CLAUSE THAT GOING FORWARD NO MORE DACA?
Before Sept 1, or you going to have an emergency session to change screwing people in the middle of hurricane season? No? Just for hate?
Hey!  Please stop holding back the gasoline which is ready to ship from Valero.  Enough of this government stuff!
HOUSTON IS ONE HUGE BIOCHEMICAL HAZARD AREA NOW. MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY STARTING TO GET SICK DOING CLEAN UP . PULLING OUT.
WHY WEREN'T CLEAN UP CREWS STAGED AND READY TO DEPLOY 3 DAYS BEFORE LANDFALL.
ANOTHER CAT4-5 STORM WILL THREATEN EAST COAST BECAUSE OF HIGH SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE ANOMALIES.  WE'RE DANG LUCKY IRMA ISN'T COMING TO TEX.
HARVEY WENT TO CAT4 INSTEAD OF CAT1 AND RAINFALL RATES WERE 10-15% HIGHER BECAUSE OF RECORD SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES (33C).  GLOBAL WARMING.
DON'T BE PATTING LEADERSHIP ON THE BACK.
SUPERFUND TOXIC WASTE SITES ARE IN DANGER. WHY AREN'T YOU SCREAMING.
WHAT DANGEROUS CHEMICALS ARE A DANGER TO THE PUBLIC RIGHT NOW, AND WHY DIDN'T YOU WARN TEXANS BEFORE LAND FALL
LCRA STARTED DRAWING DOWN HIGHLAND LAKES A WEEK BEFORE LANDFALL AND ADDED TO COLORADO RIVER FLOODING, POOR COORDINATION.
YOU KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE AN EPIC FLOOD IN SE TEXAS A WEEK BEFORE LANDFALL AND DID NOTHING TO PREPARE IN ADVANCE.
WHY WEREN'T FIRST RESPONDERS STAGED 3 DAYS BEFORE LANDFALL? WHY WASN'T FEMA STAGED AND READY TO DEPLOY THE DAY OF LANDFALL?
DUMP TRUMPS AND LOADERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN STAGING THE WEEK BEFORE LANDFALL.  GUYS IN BOATS WERE READY TO GO.
WHERE ARE THE DUMP TRUCKS AND LOADERS. TEXAS FLOOD AREA NEEDS 1000 LOADERS AND 2000 DUMP TRUCKS A WEEK AGO LINED UP AND READ TO GO.    *NOW*
But developer of these home should be liable for building homes in a flood zone area this was so predictable after Catrina
I hear that TX has a big rainy day fund that you're not gonna use. You gonna make tax payers in the other 49 pay instead?
What are you saving the rainy day fund for? Pretty sure we just got KIND OF A LOT OF RAIN and a lot of people need help. Tangible help.
God Responded! I WARNED Pastor Joel OSTEEN Houston Tx FOR YEARS about not teaching THE GREATEST COMMANDMENT!
Texas gov called special session to protect bigots and rapists, won't for hurricane victims - This is the @GOP. Care more for $ than people
You and At Paxton will fail at banning "Santuary Cities" and DACA
Contact TxAG Ken Paxton Texas 
NO on Sept 5th lawsuit
Let him know how you feel
(512) 463-2100 #DACA #TheResistance #ImpeachTrump 
Hi dirty Abbott who demanded laws that cover up cancerous chemicals for Rich Corporations. Such a big smile to cover up your evil corp greed

http://usat.ly/2xOTbqm  via @usatoday
U R responsible for breadth, depth, severity. Greedy loathsome hypocrite put people in harm's way. No regs, $, this disaster's on u. Damn u.
Greg Abbott was a great Attorney General and now a great governor and one day hopefully a great president you have my vote
Awww lookie it's a bot

SO QUID PRO QUO. DISASTER  RELIEF FOR SUING TO DEPORT DACAS. THIS WHO TEXANS ARE?  THE REP'LICIAN BASE ARE SEEN AS HEARTLSS ARND THE WORLD!!
Where r they supposed to access computers if they r in shelters? Maybe u should send workers from other cities to shelters 2 help ppl apply
Looks like th US Constitution kicked ur butt AGAIN and said NO to sb4.  Just like it says no to u taking away th vote fr browns n blacks. 
All the Illegal Aliens are going to be calling their brothers and cousins to come to work in Houston.They push the Americans OUT of the work
Aliens? 
The construction work here in Houston after Hurricane Harvey, is going to draw even MORE ILLEGAL ALIENS to Houston. Like flies to crap.
Good to know where ur priorities are while tens of thousands lost everything while us out of towners lend a hand to biggoted ppl like u
He's a bot. Let's see Mark out there working for the same small pay as they paid those illegal "aliens". 
Where do we get gas masks? From Arkema?
Relief!!!? Really? what happened to "don't mess with Texas" or the plan to secede?!!!! Now you want everyone's prayers and help.. Typical!
Somebody loves socialism all of a sudden.
Hello

OOPS. 
Guess the people of Crosby don't have the right to know what's in their backyard...thanks to you.
#Arkema

Thank God for your leadership, sir #HurricaneHarvey
What leadership? He can hold a special secession over a bathroom but NOT A SESSION 2 VOTE ON RELEASING TAINYDAY FUND 2 HELP U GUYS !
Governor Abbott, I am sending a fax to your office. Please try and put in French Drains around the chemical plant in Crosby to drain it
Governor, the ground below the subsoil is NOT saturated. Water has filled the topsoil to capacity but not the subsoil. Dig below to drain it
