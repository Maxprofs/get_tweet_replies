As long as you're leisurely surfing the web, you might as well read Olivia's story. She's one of your constituents.
Hey @JohnCornyn and @tedcruz. This is Olivia. Medicaid and the ACA keep her alive. Thought you should know. http://protectourcare.us/stories/stories-by-state/texas-stories … 
Bro, didn't we already discussed this. Everyone loves Olivia, which is why @JohnCornyn wants to give her better care than Medicrap.
What is that better care? GoFundMe?
No. Competitive care is BETTER and cheaper. Do you know how many insurers are in her market with ACA?
Quite sure her lifetime benefit (under preACA rules) would already be reached. Better?
Seriously? Was I the only person with healthcare pre aca?
Pre-ACA days disabled kids' families went bankrupt & kids institutionalized. Try talking 2 mom of disabled 2 understand complexities of HC
Listen I get it. It's had to understand it as a nationwide commodity market when you're personally invested in it.
These museums honor good, or bad, people who've died. Justice Thomas isn't dead. Bipartisan healthcare first! Museum distraction later.
What's your point?
Oh lord, what other "injustice" will you speak to next?
He is a sexual harasser.
Maybe because he is a bad human being and AA museum wants to highlight good human beings?
The last time I knew Clarence Thomas wasn't dead.  Have you heard differently?
Jim Vance =
Unblemished reputation
Clarence Thomas = accused sexual predator
Maybe they don't want a sexual predator among thei honorees
He ain't dead yet is he. Plus he haven't contributed anything to the AA community at all. He's been an antagonist toward AA community
Good sexual predators don't deserve to be in museums.
John Cornyn trying to tell African-Americans what to do.
You need to be encouraging POTUS Trump to do something about it.  He needs to tell Cabinet member who is responsible to replace the director
Pathetically Disturbed Dems!!

Sen. Graham on Trump: “This is not draining the swamp. What he’s interjecting is turning democracy upside down.” 
Anita Hill should be in, too.
Why?
Her testimony almost prevented his confirmation and has affected public view of him since.
Her testimony also blew the doors open on sexual harassment in the work place. She was a brave woman.
Yes she is!
John Cornyn, acolyte of creepy billionaires...
Don't forget to call OJ after you get this all straightend out, John. He sleeps better hearing your voice before lights out.
.@JohnCornyn Your concern for museum exhibit vs your own constituents is par 4 course! Ps stay in your lane & #DoYourJob 
#NoTrumpCare
If I was Justice Thomas I wouldn't want to be in that racist edifice...
Will you fight to protect the voting rights act, or is this just fake concern for the one black guy you like?
Because he doesn't deserve it.
I am coming to Washington next summer...I expect to see this honorable great justice, Clarence Thomas in the African American museum.@NMAAHC
Clarence Thomas has worked his entire life both privately and publicly to run a way from his heritage. He does not represent the Black cause
Clarence Thomas came with his own bag of problems. Not necessarily a Supreme Court Justice of distinction.
He is a hack, and a sexual predator. He is also the most ineffectual Justice to  sit on the SCOTUS.  He has not earned a spot at the museum.
Make an amendment with fellow Senators to have him added, he deserves it!!
I see in the article you already did a resolution, maybe set up a petition to circulate on Twitter for all to sign & forward to museum
Just because you are on the Supreme Court?
Clarence Thomas may as well be a member of the all-white Freedom Caucus.
They don't want to show a honorable, conservative, and Patriotic black man. Their naked bias is there for all to see.
Your pretense of caring is transparent.
I'd really like to know why you think he isn't.
You voicemail box in DC office was full at 10:30, no one answering phone.
Is Clarence Thomas dead yet? And I don't just mean his brain!
"Hill passed a polygraph test on her sexual assault allegations. Thomas, on the other hand, refused to take one"
This is an Outrage!!! Are Our Tax Dollars funding this Democrat Propaganda Project?
Outrageous
Disgraceful!
You couldn't care less about blacks. Dare u to poll blacks who live in Texas. I used to be one of them. Ask us if your leadership helps. .
Didn't you watch the movie, "Django". They had a house slave named Stephen. He had slave mentality. Loved the master and felt superior to...
...to the rest of the black servants. He was a real Uncle Tom. That's Clarence Thomas.
White man telling the African American museum who they and should not include in their exhibits. SMDH.
other random news, Kushner still has security clearance.
an odd thing for you to focus on.
Fix our healthcare and quit worrying if sexual predators make it into the African American museum.
The original #PussyGrabber doesn't deserve it.
Do your job and impeach Trump
He does not identify as African or black.
Like you give a shit !!!
And yet you can't wait to tear down the legacy of our first black President. #ConvenientRacist
Ummm, he ain't black.
So now you're a civil rights champion, john? Great! I assume you'll publicly condemn 45s ban on transgenders in the military today, right?
The GOP really likes their gropers.
Surely all that cash his wife didn't disclose receiving from the Heritage Foundation would buy some kind of exhibit? Maybe with Anita Hill?
Jim Vance died before he got in so...
Disgrace.
Living people are generally not featured in museums.
Probably because many Americans remember the Thomas hearings. Even though he was confirmed, questions still exist and shade his approval.
if you can't protect proper procedure and order in the US Senate you should step down now
NO TO WEALTHCARE BILL
How abt posting what part #BCRA aka #Trumpcare you support? Taking away #protections for #PreExistingConditions? #CadillacTax hurts unions?
Aren't you supposed to be writing a health care bill right now? Oh, wait, that's over lunch, nevermind. Carry on.
No writing, just voting. It's an impromptu performance piece.
You are a Senator make it happen.
Anita Hill was telling the truth.
Seriously, Senator?
Anita Hill should be in ... not Thomas !
So much bs

We find no evidence of the individual market collapsing. Rather, insurers on track to have best year since ACA began http://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/individual-insurance-market-performance-in-early-2017/ … 
Let's wait until the fact he was a serial sexual predator fades from memory of his accomplishments.
OMG! That spells out the real issue with  liberals...if your not part of them, your the enemy.

EXCLUSIVE: US Joint Chiefs of Staff tells military there will be no modification to transgender policy until direction received from Pres
The U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff clearly think Trump is an idiot. Wonder how far they got through their respective liquor cabinets yesterday.
That's because the museum never built an Uncle Tom wing
That's funny! Lol

POINT 7: CBO lays blame for the insurer exit largely with Trump.   In fact... 12 
Unlike your emperor not everyone thinks sexual harassment is ok.
You're a funny little troll, John.
Wow, look at you, John! Dilligently and earnestly fighting for equity in our society. Have you talked to John Lewis about this yet?
Your opinion on this is what, then?
