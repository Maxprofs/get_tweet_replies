What would've happened had the GOP not undermined the ACA at every turn?
Because of people like you!
Caused by the Republicans' insistence on creating a model vulnerable to the whims of a for-profit industry. You made this problem.
Tell the truth premiums go up because it's been sabatoged
#propaganda #FakeNews more lies from #CowardCornyn and #PartyOfLiars that place #PartyOverCountry your daddy #trump wants to end #Nafta
R's should be ashamed to report this when you haven't REPEALED O'Care AS PROMISED OVER & OVER! REPEAL! FORGET REPLACE!
Repubs have the numbers.  Repubs own it now.  Act
It's telling that Senate Republicans want to keep maligning the ACA but won't even share what y'all are working on regarding healthcare.
Your plan of "Let them eat two cakes, and file medical bankruptcy in the morning" is abhorrent.
Because GOP refuses to consider single payer, and wants to guarantee insurers a profit. Oh and huge #taxcutsforthewealthy
Reductions in Medicare hurts the handicapped, the elderly, children and Texas. You can’t be for that can you? A Texas voter.
What's your healthcare plan?   Where can I find specifics?  ACA works for many and all agree it can be improved.
Sounds bad. Any ideas for a solution, or you just feel like complaining? You are a senator, FYI. #Obamacare #ACARepeal #ACA #AHCAKills
The Trump administration has caused market uncertainty and is destabilizing Obamacare. We are not as uninformed as you think.
 how is bill going to reduce healthcare costs?
Thank goodness our congress gets government funded healthcare. I mean, imagine if they were threatened with losing their coverage? 
How much will higher premiums for pre-existing conditions and lifetime caps cost the average citizen, do you think?
The insurance companies all have said a good portion of the increase is due to GOP creating uncertainty. Self-fulfilling prophecy #AHCA
You keep repeating this lie, as if you think we're stupid, so I'll keep sending you this link:
Hope you don't get kidney disease. Obamacare saved my husband. Please don't spread falsehood...leave lies to potus. Support donors
So what are you doing about it? How are you making healthcare better for everyone? #WeAreWatching
And insurance companies have stated much of that is due to Trump/GOP - hope this is all worth losing Congress in 2018 and White House 2020.
Your graph shows no premium increase 2014-2016
John. We talked about this. You can't point to a broken system without taking credit for your part in breaking it.
Now, why don't you #ShowUsTheBill - the new one you're working on? Rumor has it that it's worse than the hugely unpopular House bill.
If you're in the mood to engage today (ha!), I would love to know why you think taking healthcare away from millions is a winning strategy.
Show us your bill. Secrecy = up to no good. What are you trying to hide?
ok health ins is expensive for variety reasons, what is Rs going to do? healthy pay small amount and not so healthy pay a lot?
So what are you proposing and why not share with rest of senate??
Because. . Repubs, led by idiot McConnell REFUSED to work on improving the ACA which we knew was needed...this ALL is on your shoulders..SOB

hiding the Senate healthcare bill
because R's sabotaged it! Why do you insist on this charade of not being the source of failure? Refuse to pay, repeal....
A real leader would have reached across the aisle and worked to fix the ACA. Instead, you and your gang of 13 men craft a bill in secrecy.
Because of gop sabotage
If your goal is to mobile people like me against you, then you are on your way to success.
And you're in a state where we DECLINED Medicare assistance.  BTW?  Your plan doesn't stop this from happening either, genius.
And what was it from 2000-2008?
There you go again. Denigrating Obama care for the imperfections Republicans refused to correct.
it's clear that you can hold your seat as long as you desire. Sadly, you don't see that as an opportunity to raise the bar.
Never mind that GOP negligence is actually what's causing increased premiums & uncertainty for insurers. The truth is hard to accept, right?
Instead of deflecting why don't you reveal how your plan is going to drive costs down...or will it?
They increased for employers too. Insurance companies are unsure you are going to remove the mandate. If u do insrnc skyrockets.
This is a terribly misleading analysis from a partisan source. #FakeNews
NOT TRUE!  Just because you say it doesn't make it true.  Grow up and stop casting blame. What are YOU going to do to fix it isthe question?
Congress needs to CANCEL summer recess until you get HC repealed & tax reform done. Stop with the excuses and GET TO WORK!
When will you share the GOP plan with America to review and debate?
@JohnCornyn @SenTedCruz @SenJohnMcCain @marcorubio quit hiding the AHCA. Why hasntb @RandPaul been looking for the Senate bill?
Oh, I keep hearing 109%, 200%, blah, blah, blah-the blame lies at the feet of the GOP
Quit killing it! You have rescinded Obama EOs do the same to Trumps killing the markets.
Where is your backroom plan?
So what's your alternative?
#ReplyToRetweetRatio Ouchies.
So dont try to fix it!!!  Force TRUMPcare down our throats that congress wont even have as personal insurance.#RUSSIA#COVERUP#fakecongress
And yet, many were still cheaper than what people had been paying before! And, more people have insurance than before!
Because insurance companies are pandered to by greedy Republicans
Fix the ACA. Do not leave Texans without health care coverage. Your decision: Send me to the TMC or to the grave. #shame
The 20 million+ you and Rafael are trying to kick off the insurance rolls would LOVE to pay 25% annual premium hikes, John.
Even @realDonaldTrump thinks your plan is mean. you should do better, be better.
John, your cure is likely worse than the disease because Rs foolishly painted themselves into a corner with a slogan Repeal/Replace. No guts
yet you're still coming up with a solution that's EVEN WORSE.
Your solutions would make this worse. The ACA demonstrably reduced the rate of rise of premiums, and you know it! Quit spreading fear.
And you have done nothing to help! Just your pathetic talk about repeal is enough to cause havoc in the insurance market.  Shame on you!
lets get to work and get new act passed, we elected rep's to act, not just talk
Cornyn the day you tell the truth will be one of the 7 signs of the apocalypse.
Y'all are just dogs in the manger over the ACA; yet you can't PROVE that you can govern any better. You can't fix problems. Just stop
So the answer is a secret plan that strips away essential services and gives huge tax cuts to the rich.
#ShowUsTheBill Don't talk about our less than green grass if you aren't offering a better solution.
Republican Sabotage Period! The GOP has no interest in governance...just sticking it to Obama & tax cuts to the rich.  A useless party.
23 million people will see huge monthly savings - primarily because they will no longer have insurance at all, & dying is super cheap. 
Why won't you share your solution? Is it because it won't include the most popular parts of O'care such as preexisting conditions, wellness?
See you all at the polls, thanks for the gift of getting the House back. Maybe you’ll give up the Senate too?
Disaggregate this data to get the real story. Premiums went up the most in states that turned down the Medicaid expansion (like Texas).
What were you doing for eight years while the ACA was in practice? You could have reached across the aisle and fixed what wasn't working.
Instead, you chose to fight the whole premise of essential health benefits, and protection of those with disabilities who need care.
looks like uncertainty in marketplace because of GOP is hurting Americans.


Trump's actions on Obamacare threaten to undermine insurance markets -
Marco Rubio Quietly Undermines Affordable Care Act - The New York Times
Republicans Raised Your Health Care Premiums, Not Obamacare | Policy Dose | US News
The GOP is responsible for weakening Obamacare! You need to stop with the propaganda as we all know it's a lie!
So how does that compare to what AHCA is going to cost us? Seriously! The truth! This shady HC plan y'all r cooking up is gonna be far worse
You should be explaining what replacement does to help instead of slamming ACA. Trump said your plan is "mean." Comment?
45 actually said the House bill is mean. He doesn't have a clue what's in the Senate bill--like the rest of us. GOP in secret bc it's bad!
WHERE IS THE BILL??????
Why are u working in secret? Why won't u work with Dems to fix ACA? What's happening to Medicaid? Lifetime caps on employer based insurance?
Any update on Trumpcare? I guess not...super secret stuff.
Ridiculous that you are crafting this bill in secrecy, never lifted a finger with the ACA and have the audacity to malign it. SHOW US!!!
Then REPEAL IT!!!!!!@@
Oh just like it was for business owners prior to ACA? Just because individuals are now affected you are paying attention? FIX healthcare!
#ShowUsTheBill
The ACA was far from perfect. But it did a lot of good - and helped millions of Americans.
Because Trump ordered that the ACA stop being supported. Companies are dropping out because they're afraid they won't get paid next year.
John knows that. That is despicable - quoting party line while knowing better. HC companies give John big $$ to do that. And people die.
while you sat back and watched and did nothing to fix it to score petty political points for your party. The #GOP has lost all honor.
What percent of the time did GOP threaten funding? Because those 2 are related. Stop lying to your constituents.
All you need to know/it's easy
Obamacare=Good 4 You 
Cuts by Republicans kill Obamacare
Obamacare dead=Bad 4 you
TrumpCare=death to you 
Get the FACTS ON OBAMACARE STRUGGLES HERE:
And now please tell everyone the reason why!?!?
your fault as u and ur ilk did nothing but hold out. Obstructionist.
Where is your town hall to sell the new & improved GOP bill? 45 calls it "mean" so we're all very curious on how GOP makes life better 
My premium increased $0.0
Cry baby . Blame no one but you!
We know why!! Stop sabotaging the ACA & fund CSRs #ShowUsTheBill #SinglePayer #MedicareForAll
"Will there be a hearing on the health care proposal?" Senator @clairecmc asked today in the Finance Cmte. You should watch: #Trumpcare 
What was happening to premiums pre OCare? Were you pleased with how the market was functioning?
Does that mean you will #ShowUsTheBill
#ShowUsTheBill
How will a tax break for the wealthy improve healthcare for Texans? #ahca #trumpcare @tedcruz
How go the Shadow Negotiations? How many will lose coverage? How much more will elderly & pre-ex condition folks pay? Dismantling Medicaid?
well we could compare it to Trumpcare but it is hidden from us @MSNBC @indivisibletxjc @IndivisibleTeam @nytimes @indtx36
We KNOW Obamacare needs revision.  NO ONE disputes that fact.  So, DO YOUR JOB, get out of the dark & REPAIR IT! @tedcruz @SenateMajLdr
Because of Rs refusal to work on a plan generated by a Black President and instead sabotaging it.  On this day you should think about it.
So help fix it, don't debate a bill in secret without oversight from your constituents!
because it wasnt allowed to work the way it could have. bigger question is how r yall going to fix it? Or r yall going 2 make things worse?
Premiums are increasing due to the market patiently waiting for your cronies to hand out tax cuts & give them reason to not insure the poor
Mostly due to the uncertainty and sabotaging done by your party.  Not an opinion.  Has been stated by multiple insurance companies.
When will you humble yourself and place our country and the wellbeing of her people first?
Oh John. You must be so tired of defending your indefensible stance. Why don't you just retire  & live on your multiple tax paid pensions.
Disregard any info from this known liar.
And what were they doing BEFORE the ACA? Increasing by even more. Stop bashing the ACA until you can prove you can do better
My fellow Texans,  let's vote both he and @SenTedCruz out in 2020!
Cruz is out in 2018. #betofortexas @BetoSenate2018
Ahh yes he is!!  Cornyn is up in 2020.  Thanks for the reminder!!  #betoforsenate
So, your justification for taking away people's health care is that the free market is terrible? Maybe if Republicans stopped sabotaging it.
What are you doing about it? Is the solution just to make sure millions have no healthcare at all?  Quit bashing Obamacare and do something.
We'll all be calling you in a bit to voice our concerns. Please tell your staff to be patient w us; we are afraid of losing our coverage!!
I wonder what changed in 2017 to bring on that price change? 
Please explain how your SECRETIVE version is plans on improving the issue. Remember, screw us & Texas will screw you!
How many will lose coverage due to your GOP secret healthcare bill? Have meetings or we'll flip the vote and you'll be out of office!!
Where your bill ? Your donors know what is in the bill. Just not the America people
Why are the negotiations for the AHCA a secret? What are y'all hiding? Maybe you should be kicked off your ins & see how it feels.
Where in the hell is your bill? #Trumpcare #DumpsterFire
Why we still talking about #BrokenObamacare 
What is on #AmericanHealthCare and how it will be better for people? 
Plan and talk for future
If the ACA is not performing it's bc you & T Want it to Fail. The people want to KEEP it & the AHCA is a Very Poor substitute.
First: it is not Obamacare
Second: make changes, don't start over
Third: you had over 7 years to work on fixes and you presented nothing
Just stop. Y'all sabotaged it & you aren't fixing it.
How's that super secret turd of a healthcare bill coming? Care to share any of it with us? Of course not, it's worse than the House's.
