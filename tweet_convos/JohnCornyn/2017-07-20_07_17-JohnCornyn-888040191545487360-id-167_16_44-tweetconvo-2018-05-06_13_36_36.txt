You're optimistic that your giant tax giveaway to the richest Americans in the form of taking away health insurance from the poor will pass?
Maybe all that time spent voting 2 repeal should have been spent working to fix?
Hiw about actually working on a bipartisan bill to improve ACA? Most of it works except insurance portion.

Do you think the $13,000 deductible in your plan is excessive?
They always say the same thing but never get anything done
Repub VOTERS oppose you !
You're disgusting.  Quit looking our for your own interests and #DoYourJob
By optimist are you referring to the rich?! They thanks the other 30+ million that will lose coverage will hopefully rise up & vote you out.
Optimistic millions will lose ins. while wealthy get tax breaks? #KillTheBill It's cruel. We demand transparency. Work w/Dems & improve #ACA
Preexisting NOT COVERED you can do better
How sick of a fraud like Cornyn leaching off taxpayers as he works to hurt and kill as many as possible taking away healthcare. Despicable.
The bill is about us out here, not about your demagoguery in there.  Ask us what we need!
Knowing what's in the repeal bill is a luxury we don't have? Cruel and nonsensical. You should be ashamed .
Despicable.  The GOP has become pariahs before our very eyes.
Your bill is like the zombie apocalypse
Ur not making anything better. So why make it worse? Heartless
We voted for #FullRepeal - not more special deals. The eggs are already scrambled & rotted. Back to the hen house and back to work.
Dixie, you need a MRI.  Your amygdala is swollen.  This is not a joke.
I think I'm functioning just fine, thanks, but bravo to you for finding a big word in your Word of the Day calendar.
U r a typical white, Jim Crow male. U r jealous of black men, especially one that is intellectually, emotionally superior to you/white men.

STOP IT. Fix the ACA. Stop making it about and care for your constituents.This is garbage that kills millions.
About winning. I really wish they'd get an edit button.
Why is working toward a real solution on a bipartisan basis so hard? That is what Congress is supposed to do. Tribalism gets us nowhere .
Because BLACK!
Have you no shame? Would you prefer 32 or 22 million people without health care or do you not give a damn. Are you a Christian, John?
SEVEN YEARS to address this and you all look like clowns? If u couldn't figure it out in 84 months, no trust that u have any chance to now!
Pls just stop with this shit. You lost, get over it. The ppl have spoken, now listen
Great picture. If this is what optimistic looks like would hate to see these folks when they're down.
Optimism about taking healthcare away from millions is sad and pathetic. Luckily you won't have to worry about that since Congress is exempt
Yeah, Obamacare is pretty great.
https://twitter.com/ztracer/status/888115808194277379 … It is truly shocking you continue to support this shitty plan. #worstsenatorinusa
Deductibles so high, they're not even legal. CBO shines light on GOP health plan (w/ bonus @annaedney video) https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-20/senate-s-revised-health-bill-would-boost-uninsured-by-22-million … 
Uh, you might want to take a look at breaking news from WaPo.
optimistic = brow beaten in2 submission 2 support or st least pretend

Do you care one iota about your constituents? We DON'T want Trumpcare! You are charging me FIVE times more than younger people!
Analysis | Republicans' health-care overhaul is even deader now
enough. last man out do us a favor and turn off the lights.
That apparently you're just not going to let people read. Because it's a luxury. Way to tip the evil jerk scale.


Things like THIS are why Obamacare might "fail".

h/t @SuleBertram
We do not want your crappy bill. Fix the existing problems.  Quit playing with our health,  our lives.
Please Don't.  Write a better bill.

Don't have the luxury to know what's in the bill?  Hasn't 7 years been long enough to find out?
You don't have the luxury of time to consider what's in this damn bill before voting to pass it? WTF?
Trump: 6 months in office.
836 false of misleading claims 
4.6 false claims A DAY.

You are an accomplice Coryn. Your words are meaningless
Optimistic abt millions & millions LOSING healthcare?? The R controlled House & Sen will be lost if it passes, which is really for the best
Crazy. Crazy. Crazy.
If GOP blows this & do not vote for FULL REPEAL then GOP is finished. POTUS is working for us why isn't GOP?! GOP better wake up!#MAGA
Not going to happen. ACA is here to stay. It even rhymes. 
Optimistic? I should hope so!! Especially since y'all are using ACA money to run ads lying about how it's failing. #EpicFail #resistYALL
FORGET REPLACEMENT!REPEAL 1st with phase out period.Then take time to pass bills that create free mkt & also bills to reform Medicare/caid
Did you promise them some "creative" funding?
Be ready to lose your seat if this goes through. Same people complaining about ACA are going to understand how new bill affects them soom
Apparently he never reads his reply to his tweets!
repeal without replacement is not an option for those of us with chronic diseases #MSActivist #AffordableHealthcare
Please don't do this to your integrity
You should be voting #No to #Trumpcare as it doesn't actually help ppl get & keep quality coverage!
New CBO score out on a lightly revised Senate version of TrumpCare. Still 22 million people losing insurance. https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/52941-hr1628bcra.pdf … 1/
Hey just to let you know- I'm a constituent who doesn't support this!
Special Counsel needs limits. Mueller can look any aspect of Trump's life-any time period. Can keep "investigating indefinitely." Time 2 End
Must have comprehensive coverage for women's health and preex coverage! #NoTaxBreaksFortheRich
And I'm optimistic that one day you'll act in the interests of your constituents. Hope springs eternal. #CountryOverParty
aka payoffs #cornygoals
NO MORE "LYING" TED CRUZE or " TRUMPS BITCH" JOHN CORNYN. THROW 'EM ALL OUT!!!!
22 - 32 million citizens left uninsured...that includes Texans whom you refuse to speak or even listen to...pathetic

It was wrong for the govt to take over healthcare & it's wrong to replace it with another govt handled program. #FullRepeal & #Liberty.
Sorry John we do not believe a word out of your mouth. You do not represent constituents. Your loyalty is to 45. Lost integrity. Career over
Uh huh. Believe it when I see it.
Primary all of them.
I am NOT OPTIMISTIC about #Democracy THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS!! & All Closed Door Hearings????
Are you going to start doing your job after you trash Obamacare?Will you then work to get the traitor out of office?
This sentiment applies to ALL of my representatives.
As they say, the best policy changes are made in a big hurry with limited or ignored public testimony. No, wait - no one says that. #txlege https://twitter.com/pfikac/status/887792610206777344 …
I guess they were bullied by the bully in chief during lunch yesterday.
2676 days
2676 days 2 b ready 4 of control Congress/WH
2676 days 2 craft plan 4  
2676 days chasing shiny objects
2676 days of failure
We don't want this garbage. Move on
How many millions are you killing with this attempt?
Optimistic if you give them enough handouts, without favors they're still NOs, FIRE McConnell and get someone to do the hard work
WHAT PART OF:
TEXANS WILL DIE IF OBAMACARE IS REPEALED 
DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND
You won't give up until you have hurt millions of people that you apparently think are not your constituents.
Just repeal
#TrumpCare =#NOCARE @senatorcollins @lisamurkowski @SenCapito @DeanHeller @JeffFlake @SenToomey
Just do what you promised and repeal it. Don't replace with Ocare light.
Just want to see a doctor, get hospitalization, without losing life savings. Far, far, far from impossible. @realDonaldTrump
I actually have confidence in you, @RandPaul @SenTedCruz , and others getting a good bill together. This is America , @realDonaldTrump
An OB/GYN I know said that defensive medicine to prevent lawsuits doubles the cost of health care. Tort reform please. @realDonaldTrump
Waste, Fraud, Corruption, in health care fields should be thing of the past w/ oversight. @realDonaldTrump will see to that imo
Anyone who thinks that tax dollars shouldn't secure a clean hospital bed, a good doctor,& care for us oldsters, is wrong. @realDonaldTrump
if senate gop cant get hcare done, then punt it....work on judges on fed courts which can be a equally important domestic policy work
whip gop vote on hcare
We will #RESIST and replace you as soon as possible
Have a straight up or down vote on the 2015 real bill and let's see who's with us or against us
It's so reassuring that the @GOP can "fix" their death bill in less time than it takes to write a term paper.
Not.
32 million, did it come to bribes or threats? Just a question
32,000,000 THAT'S 32 MILLION Americans without insurance. 18 MILLION by next year, #DoYourJob  #Trumpcare sucks
Cut the Pork and end earmarks!
Optimistic to take away people's health insurance? That seems like a weird way to put it.
Dude. What is it about you that sees the 12% approval of this nightmare of a bill as a thing to keep fighting for? Stop the madness. Stop!
Jared Kushner needs to testify publicly. We the people deserve to know. What are you all trying to hide!?
You would love to toss millions off health insurance.  Pitiful.  #MAGA
Y'all are so overthinking this! Just open the Congressional healthcare options to the rest of us.
If arm twisting  does not work rip them off and use them as clubs!
So you're optimistic that you'll still get your big tax cut? Optimistic that you'll still be able to screw over poor people? You're horrible
They're taking aim at America's most vulnerable, Virginia. What they're doing is ultimately genocide.
Wondering why plans like Express Scripts aren't being looked into for Prescription drug pricing problems. Govt could learn from them.
I'm calling Heller, Collins, Capito & Murkowski then. You & Cruz are a lost cause. Enact your tax cuts & leave HC out of it. Fix ACA!
'Hopeful' is not a word more than 60% of Americans would use to describe this bill.
Republican Party=Anti-Americanism
You are using optimistic wrong, I think you mean desperate.
This bill is a petty attempt to get bigger donations from the billionaire class. Whom were you hired to represent, Sir?
Murkowski doesn't LOOK optimistic. Seems like you have the same issues you had earlier in the week. Can't please both GOP extremes.
GOP is a complete FLOP. U own congress but I guess ur too hateful fr even ur own klan krew.
God I sure as hell frigging hope not! WTF is wrong w the GOP that they so desperately want a win, they r willing to compromise millions!

STOP IT. Why are you hell-bent on ignoring what constituents want? Work with Dems to fix ACA. Repeal is disasterous!
Weeell so how much money was exchanged??
You promised weeks ago that a successful vote on your TrumpCare bill was coming. You don't even have the votes to proceed. Empty talk, John.
Monsters, everyone of you. When u prayed for Sen McCain, did u consider what happens to those w/that diagnosis but no HC? Did u care?
Just can't wait to destroy millions of lives, huh John? You should be ashamed.
Why is bipartisanship so hard for you to comprehend?  The American people do not want your bill.  Fix ACA and #DoYourJob
Why are you and @GOP determined to take away #ACAProtections and force ppl to buy "coverage" that doesn't cover much of anything? #Trumpcare
Time to Repeal & Replace the GOP. #TurnTXBlue

"I'm begging, Senator Heller" - This woman is battling stage 4 cancer and Trumpcare at the same time 

This health care bill isn't simply unconscionable and unjust. It's unconstitutional.

We won't stand for it. 
Meanwhile, the other Senators - who don't give a crap about the health of their constituents - are giggling at the thought of a "victory."
Optimism abt 32mil Losing their HC? The crassness of the GOP right now is astounding. & what say you abt T threatening to fire M? Statement

Schumer doubles down on his earlier calls for a bipartisan health care plan 
 

Joe Manchin's message to GOP senators: "Let’s get together" on health care

the cows better pull their heads out of their butt and do what they promised and passed in 2015. or they are gone.
