Thank you, Chief Padilla & your team, for your service.

#MAKEADIFFERENCE!
eep in mind that you & other GOP senators are targets of a paid http://MoveOn.org   Twitter astroturf hitjob. #FakeAccounts
No need to pay us. We are tired of others trying to force their beliefs on others and being ignored by Cornyn.
still no word on your #TownHall. If your stressed 4 time maybe you & @tedcruz can have one together soon.
When are you holding a town hall in Dallas? It would be greatly appreciated.
please tell me what a single, unmanned drone can't do that these guys can? That's right, vote u coward. Pandering clown.
John, why don't you do your part and keep us safe from Russia! You know they interfered in our election and now own the WH!
oh look! It's @SenDeanHeller too!! Two cowardly senators hiding from constituents. Found you!!! #TownHall anyone???
when is that town hall?
#Houston Town Hall????  Both of you @tedcruz
@SenThomTillis your NC constituents are waiting for you Senator. You work for us. Why are you ignoring us sir?
@SenThomTillis A rare sighting of the ever illusive Thom Tillis. A man who runs & hides at the slightest hint of a #townhall.
don't hide from the people ur represent! I am so that u refuse to meet with ur constituent!
knock knock knock. 77096 here
Town Hall anytime soon or are you just going to ride out on the border ...shame on you
from children and families desperate for a better life - can we discuss immigration reform instead?
Where in the world is John Cornyn?
@SenThomTillis safe? Did they lock Tillis up in a cell?
when are having a town hall meeting?
town hall, please
@SenThomTillis Is that you at a #TownHall meeting?
@SenThomTillis once the wall is built, I guess these men will be in the unemployment line
No ban. No wall. Keep America safe by impeaching Trump.

Do not appt. Rick Perry as Energy Sec.
Oh, look! Is that a @SenThomTillis sighting? Could you please help him find his way home?! We want a town hall. @IndivisibleTeam
You are employed by us, do you think you could squeeze in a #TownHall?  If not, then you have picked party over your people.
When a Sen. or Rep. deliberately avoids calls, emails & meeting w/constituents, he/she violates the spirit of the 1st Amendment.
What's the point of border patrol when the ppl running our country are a huge natl security risk? Do something already.
Well, according to Trump they're doing a pretty terrible job.
Town hall town hall town hall town hall town hall town hall town hall town hall town hall town hall town hall town hall
Jesus, John! Hold a town hall!!
I have a new policy, ignore liberal losers which includes liberal media
Appreciate it if you would get trumps taxes released and investigate Russias influence on our elections and this administration
investigate trump.  Must resolve this issue before moving forward.
Did they catch you trying to sneak across the border to avoid your constituents?
if you want to help keep it safe you should be investigating trump!! Listen to your constituents!! Dump trump!!
when are you planning on being in North Texas to meet with your constituents?
I'm glad you appreciate their efforts. I hope you'll appreciate ours when we take your senate seat from you.
11/3/2020 Can't wait! First, we oust @tedcruz , though! 11/6/2018!
Remember remember the 3rd of November in the year of our Lord 2020 . . .
Glad you are checking out the border. How bout some Town Halls? #WeAreWatching #2020
could also caption this #ThugLife
white men with guns chasing brown ppl. Yes let's applaud that. I feel safer already. I'm ready for midterms. #registeredvoter
I too appreciate the job they do. Let's have a town hall to discuss your job. Rockwall County voter.
you will be voted out. You will be held accountable for your toxic votes.We will repeal and replace you. #AssHat #TheResistance
How's their recruitment of women going? Not well it seems based on the photo.
When is your next Town Hall?
Great! Since you somehow found your way back to TX, let's recognize them at all town hall! When and where will we find you?
They deserve your praise.  But will be holding town hall meetings in Texas?
get those white Texas rednecks who decided to shoot each other and blame immigrants! Think there are more asses out there?
This is to look busy while really just ignoring your constituents who want town halls.
Your seat is not safe in 2020, Senator. You can't ignore us forever. You owe many explanations to us here in TX
we would appreciate a listening to your constituents effort from you. Just saying...
Your respect for these employees is admirable. Will you please hold a #TownHall to meet with your constituents?
stop dodging you constituency... you we're here in Texas and chose not to have any town halls... sad
why wont you hold a town hall? Stop with the photo ops and DO YOUR JOB.
You're doing GREAT! American people behind you.
the deportation forces are targeting immigrant children, mothers, families in US with no criminal records
