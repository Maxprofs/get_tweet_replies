Instead under #Trumpcare the federal govt will be able to bar you from healthcare for 6 months if you miss a payment https://www.vox.com/2017/6/24/15867614/senate-health-waiting-period … https://twitter.com/JohnCornyn/status/879364347595829249 …
Your non-stop tweeting this morning reads as desperation and panic. You know this garbage bill is nothing but a tax cut for the wealthy. 
He just got his orders from the Koch brothers this weekend. Has to get it out or they'll stop payment on the check.
In which market are you ? Individual? Group? Medicaid? Also, were you in a different market when ACA was passed?
Sorry you got squeezed. If I understand your situation correctly, your group plan went up probably because the company had to meet EHB 1/
I have no idea your income, but you might have been helped if Texas had expanded medicaid. If this is so, you got punched by Gov. Perry. 2/
This is the group for which I am fighting. Workers whose income prevents them from having quality insurance for their family. I am not in 3/
For those who cannot afford insurance a six month penalty for a missed payment could be deadly. Why are you taking this country backwards?
John Cornyn is no friend of the poor or middle class. He is owned by special interest groups and the wealthy. Texas deserves better.
You are being willfully obtuse. As any Social Security beneficiary knows, Medicare prem deducted from yr check, there are no missed payments
7. ..Increase. We have evidence showing that it is more expensive to treat pt in ER, who's health has declined significantly d/t lack of ..
If you recognize this as a problem within Medicare and #AHCA, then do your job and fix it for all Americans. 2 wrongs don't make a right.
You're right that is a downside, let's shore up Medicare & also remove all age requirements. Looking forward to your cosponsorship of #HR676
8.. preventive care! Than,TX will absorb the cost,Cuz people WILL not be able 2 afford 2 pay 4 that ER visit or discharge care & RETURN 2 ER
6. ..Will be felt by ALL of us, but especially Middle-class America .. ER Visits will increase, pt acuity levels will change, The cost will
Except much more expensive for less coverage!
Can Texans demand a recall of our senators as they do not conduct town hall meetings with their constituents?
4. More $$ .. You are simply trying to sneak in a HUGE tax Cut, You have NO interest in Healthcare or you'd educate yourself & FIX #ACA
Easy and COWARDLY for you to tweet your blanket statements as truth when you are unwilling to face your constituents & hear our voices!
And we can't even get a human staffer on the line when we call, lucky to even be able to leave a message
You can always send him letter/email. He will reply, eventually, w/form letter patting himself on back for wonderful work he's doing for us!
Ugh
I usually have good luck with local offices. Try them, they are also friendly most of the time.
Yep. Had to call about 5 of them for Cronyn before I got a human though. My local office has a number that's disconnected.
That is so awful.
Yes.  Punish the families of frail elderly people by taking away their health care.  #ADCA
Wait ... so that's something you disagree with in Medicare AND it's something you're adding to the ACA repeal. What sense does that make???
And that's bs
What orders did u get from the Koch bros this weekend? Previously they wanted 2 abolish Medicare/ Medicaid & no tax supported health plan.
But you'll be eliminating Medicare.
What good Christian would WORK at taking health insurance from the poor and most vulnerable among us?
effin seriously?? Medicare premiums are taken out of a person's social security check so stop trying to manipulate the facts
5. The increase of cost healthcare, if preventive care is not obtained by pt with chronic diseases like Diabetes & High Blood Pressure ..
3. Medicare IS Single-Payer .. VA, thats UHC!! ..Repeal #ACA & Replacing with #Trumpcare is DEATH! Why can't you fix it? Do The Kochs NEED
1. With all due respect, YOU are SO Wrong!! I know you got paid quite a bit by the insurance & big Pharm lobbyist, But Mitch got 500k! ...
@ronwyden We should get rid of 6-mo bar and let insurers at least temporarily refuse to cover pre-existing conditions. Feel better now?
NOT like Medicare... there only applies to preexist condit. Still have orig Medicare during 6mo to cover. You want to leave Us w/no coverage
Make a health care plan for the people and not the lobbyists
Your Healthcare plan is OBAMALIGHT.  Where r the free market choices and reduced costs.  Why r we still subsidizing insurance companies
These tweets anger many, including republicans like me. Stop this. Please!
Vote them out!!
Wicked men!!
Only applies to Medicare Advantage. And there's a grace period and a "good cause" clause. Plus, lose MA auto enrolled in orig medicare.

You have no idea what you're talking about - false!
Political terrorist using emotional abuse to try and sway public opinion.
Says the guy making around $150,000./yr. It's hard to relate to the problems of everyday Americans when you're financially secure and backed
Time for you to retire John. You're irrelevant.
@RonWyden gee John I thought my wife's Medicare premium was being deducted from her social security benefits @indivisibletxjc
McConnell & Cornyn are two terrible Senators. When they're gone, Gov't will automatically improve. Public servants, who serve themselves.
...pampered ar the Koch's retreat. Do your job for a change
Wait, so you do or don't like Medicare?
Have you talked to the constituents you supposedly represent? Nope, no tow  halls, your office doesn't answer calls, but time to get...
You are  a Senator, have some pride and dignity.
Bless your heart. Are you genuinely this shortsighted & cruel?
This is a truly crappy policy. Double punishment for contract employees and those who lose their jobs.NO! I'm a TX Republican.No to this!
I am with u .  Emailing these politicians doesn't seem to help.
I would say his tweetstorm today seems like a response to your action. Keep it up!
Repeal the whole monster Obamacare.
If you prefer being denied for having a pre-existing condition and not being guaranteed ER treatment, having a life time cap. Sure.
Yes. Great. Let's just do what we did before Obamacare since the founding of this country.
No. Let's make sure kids don't die for rich people to get a tax cut.
Has nothing to do with rich people. Obamacare was created to control the people. Not a healthcare law. Repeal the whole monster.
It has everything to do with rich people. The richest individuals and corporations have more say in the political process than we the people
This bill does not repeal the ACA, not govt regulations, nor subsidies, nor pre-existing condition coverage. It stops states choosing to
Expand Medicaid. It stops children getting treatment because their parents got fired. How is that their fault. It provides a massive tax cut
Your greedy ways will come back to haunt you in 2020. Too bad we have to wait that long to vote you out.
Sorry that's where the comparisons stop. Medicare is generous whereas the #BCRA #Trumpcare is cruel.
@  Is Rylan in it for money
I figure someone who is #ProfitsOverPeople would know where I can sell organs to rich old geezers like you.  You put me in a bad mood.
Hey you know where I can sell my organs? Because when I get fired for dying I'll need to still be able to provide for my child. #Profit
Then fix Medicare? Why do you make everything so difficult? Logic is your friend Senator.
then change Medicare! .
Honestly, WE Americans really DON'T know anything about ANY Healthcare Bill or Insurance in General. Needs Clearer Explanation.
When will you guys accept that just because someone/thing does something doesn't make it right/wrong for another to do?!!
So if you are too poor to make a payment,your punished by barred from healthcare for 6 months.Taking another shot at the poor. Not Christian

Not gonna happen @JohnCornyn  #TrumpcareIsTrash #VoteNoAHCA #voteouttheincumbent #vote2020
you sure are panicked this morning john,  is it because your lining your pockets on the blood and deaths of your fellow texans?
we already know how much youve gotten in donations from these groups you are getting ready to give tax breaks for. So how many txns will die
oh wait we already know how many will die and how much blood will be on your hands John, here's the list per state.
So again john,  you ready to start seeing tombstones in your home town for every single person who dies saying Im dead thx to John Cornyn?
The USA is now doctors, patients &  taxpayers  vs politicians wanting to give a tax break to 400 billionaires
The American Medical Association opposes BRCA: The draft legislation violates the 'first, do no harm' standard medicine operates under. 
You are the epitome of #FakeNewsMedia
John u just keep digging the hole we hate this bill FIX ACA ...it is not hard ...It is the most cost effective ...less economic disruption
Your like a junior high school kid .You have to attack cause its a D Just like Trump attack evrything and everyone but your self
Then let's go Medicare for all, John, if you want to make that condition.
#LetUSLIVE
#AHCA IS UNAMERICAN The @SenateGOP IS LYING. Full stop.
Yes it is! Do you see what you are doing GOP??? CARE!!!!
#AHCA IS MURDER. #VICHYCORNYN
Did you just endorse Medicare for all?
@realDonaldTrump promised universal healthcare. Most of us knew he was lying, but Republicons will still pay at the polls. #VoteThemOut

It seems fitting that, with the #TrumpCare debate raging, I got this bill in the mail today from Ethan's most recent open heart surgery.
