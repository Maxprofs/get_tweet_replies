Manufacturing jobs as a percentage of all private sector jobs: 

Oct. 1996: 17.0%
Oct. 2006: 12.2%…
Notice how FoxNews didn't go back to 1945 to show you the full trend? Easier to manipulate years to blame NAFTA
pre industrial revolution? Why not go back to 1800's. Trade deals drive trade trends. It's not rocket surgery.
If you'd like a fuller picture of causes (instead of cherry picked dates) here's a interesting graph
international trade. Because businesses like profits and people like cheap stuff. Globalisation is a two edged sword.
NAFTA fueled most of that
actually the technology boom fueled that.  NAFTA was signed in 1993 and manufacturing increased for seven years
data doesn't support that. Technology, trade agreements both drive it down.
except the data does support it. http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES3000000001 …
Yet manufacturing output increases.  Making it expensive to hire people means they figure out ways to use less people.
trade agreements fueled that trend, businesses like profits and people like cheap stuff.
curious?when do u suppose the US will declare real war?like evry war evr fought.wars dont end until sum1 surrenders!frm 2much loss
@FoxNewsResearch Trump is bang on
@JohnCornyn not really. Fox News is no more credible that the huff post
WOW that is an incredibly LOW number!! No wonder Trump WON!!!
@FoxNewsResearch yes it explains that technology is replacing human jobs.
.@brithume @JohnCornyn Yep. It's the robots.

@FoxNewsResearch the sad truth of why the middle class is eroding.  Times changed and our education and trade ed did not.
@FoxNewsResearch Actually it doesn't. Rate of decline 2006-2016 is lower than rate of decline 1996-2006. Explain more.
That was exactly what Rick Santorum was arguing in his campaign 4 POTUS; we need to bring manufacturing back by elim disincentives
@FoxNewsResearch Thank Bill Clinton and all the dumb ass conservatives who believed America could be better served by NAFTA.
@FoxNewsResearch Interesting however nothing will reverse the trend in a globalized work -force. Robotics
Thanks to our trade deals.
@FoxNewsResearch #automation has to account for a decent (and growing) percentage
@shleever  Trump will bring back our jobs.
...POV based on percentages might be mis-leading. \
US Manufacturing jobs in absolute number terms? 2000-2016, 17+ million to 12.3. Steady, unspectacular increase since ~2011. >
@FoxNewsResearch #manufacturing - these are devastating statistics. We would have lost WW1 & 2 had this been our condition.
That is why we need @realDonaldTrump  to keep his campaign promises. We will make America great again. #MAGA
@FoxNewsResearch and DC has been asleep at the switch while this was going on taking money from special interests
Yes it does
@FoxNewsResearch Obama has ruled over a crumbling empire imposed by his miserable decisions, exhaustive regulations, and taxes.
@FoxNewsResearch perhaps can slowly improve the disturbing trend.
@FoxNewsResearch just shows how pitiful Obama really was!!  Thank God we can now begin to grow our economy with a real president!
war is wen people die!citys demolished!boots on ground!
I wonder why the Dems missed this statistic, hmmmm.
Manufacturers keep saying jobs are going unfilled because of skills gaps. http://www.nam.org/Newsroom/Top-20-Facts-About-Manufacturing/ …
Forced me to retire much earlier than I wanted.
@JohnCornyn @FoxNewsResearch fractions also have denominators.
@FoxNewsResearch good stat, but would be good to know what part automation played in its decline vs outsourcing etc
@FoxNewsResearch Its been dropping since 1920. Same farms. USA labor productivity hi! Bad Dem state govts blame. Jobs went South.
@FoxNewsResearch Private sector manufacturing provided good paying, blue collar jobs. My parents provided a comfortable living.
Now those not graduating from college have fewer choices at wages that will not support a family. Need prod. Jobs
@FoxNewsResearch ...that's a result of the fine domestic policies of BHO...
...NOT!!!
@FoxNewsResearch I started my manufacturing business in early 1997. Luckily, I'm not included in those stats. Celebrate 20 in Feb
@billpostmus @FoxNewsResearch those jobs are never coming back...
How has non-profit organization employment changed in last 15-20 years? Seems like there's one for every possible issue.
Yes it does -- Trump catering to unions--can't throw off those Leftist leanings.
We senior citizens can certainly attest to those figures.
Very astute.Don't forgot all the manufacturing support jobs, purchasing,accounting/billing/marketing,sales,advertising,shipping.
nobama did it too
@FoxNewsResearch NAFTA
and the liberal elites still think it's just a bunch of dumb, racists in rural America that voted Trump.
Yes it does.
Need a comparison with increased use of automation.
@FoxNewsResearch  robots
@FoxNewsResearch So it's not Pres. Obama's fault
efficiencies derived from technologies not entered into your calculus. consider work product per manufacturing job over time.
@FoxNewsResearch I once heard something about a great sucking sound.
@FoxNewsResearch I call on manufacturers in sales. I notice a fair amount of women working the floor. Issue goes beyond male vote
@FoxNewsResearch Wow...it certainly does.
@FoxNewsResearch Can Trump change that number ?
not only are they good jobs now gone, but no college degree req'd for these good jobs. Important to have this avenue.
This says a lot in a few words:

Recount:  Wi, Mi, Pa

With love ~ Jillary
@FoxNewsResearch Spoiler Alert: No President is going to turn this around. Ever. I knew this when I was 12 years old.
@FoxNewsResearch Have you ever heard of robots and automation?
Wrong. People still going these jobs just not in US.
but keep in mind industrial productivity is increasing at the very same time. US needs industrial engineers not low-skilled labor.
@FoxNewsResearch no doesn't explain.  no raises in 20 yrs, benefits stripped, unions corrupt, schools horr + WALLSTREET economy
not to mention that government jobs now outnumber manufacturing jobs.
adding 76 and 86 would be interesting.
@FoxNewsResearch A better stat would be the change in value produced for manufacturing worker over the same period.
@FoxNewsResearch Says much about the election.
@FoxNewsResearch That's a lot of good jobs with benefits that are gone.
