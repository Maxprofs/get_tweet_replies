You are delusional.
does that mean I can legally not have car insurance? Homeowners? Not wear my seatbelt?  Brute force geez. Distracting again John
and it's wrong. The people who will suffer the most are the people choosing not between phones but eating versus healthcare!
Affordable ones? Didn't think so, but then you've got all the health insurance your family needs. #hypocrite #waitingfor2020
But it transparently doesn't.
.@WSJ Those dumb enough to forego healthcare under current system not smart enough to make good choices in an expanded market.
If you don't have money to buy it, then you don't have money to buy it.
So cut off that iPhone, iPad, partying and you can afford it.
yeah, well.  That is 
get your head in the REAL world. GOP plan does NOT help the American people but will leave MILLIONS without insurance
which is why it's clear the republicans don't think very often
What new alternatives will the market offer that it wasn't offering before the ACA? Why will what failed before succeed now?
HOOOOOOOOOOW!!! Mandates didn't get everyone in...please use your words!!!! HOOOOOW are you going to increase the risk pool?!?!!
Name a country with a free market healthcare system that provides affordable coverage to everyone of it's citizens. Nonexistent.
Republicans think many things. They are generally wrong.
what about those who can't afford it?You know, the poor, the sick, the suffering?Pretty sure Jesus doesn't approve of this plan
I teach at an inner city middle school and high school. I'm tired of my sick kids not having health care bc y'all are selfish.
It's been debunked. The whole free market for health insurance.
you can't make those things happen & if you willing to regulate HC then treat it like a utility. It should be a public good.
Worth the cost they can't afford.
Rs also don't believe in climate change, think we don't need mass transit, & we need a walI on Mex. border. Idc what Rs think.
you don't get it--for coverage to be effective, it has to cover essential services--otherwise it just limits liability of ins co
H.R. 1275 Bill called world's greatest healthcare in the world...republicans are trying the harm the work class and elderly
Great argument for adjusting the current law
and yet, we've already seen that isn't true...
thinking is not the strong suit of the Republican party. Making the rich more wealthy is what you do best. Stop trying to think.
And you believe this?   Required auto insurance,  required home insurance with mortgage  but don't need requirement for health.
stop selling  HC. We the constituents r smart enough to understand it doesn't serve the  people.
I'm self employed. I can afford it either way
hahahahahahahaha republicans think?
worth the cost? The whole point was to have insurance for people who have nothing. Don't you people ever listen?
60% of Americans don't have  $500 in savings. They don't buy health care because they can't afford it.
Alternatives? What alternatives? Once again, U ask for blind acceptance as U try to screw us over. This is wrong & UnChristian!
why not get it right the first time instead of hurting and killing people who need help? Especially elderly.
What alternatives? Less coverage at higher price? Mark my words, costs will rise as healthy will wait w/ penalty of one year higher fees.
24 millions Americans will lose coverage. Period. Immoral. Unchristian. 
Republicans are wrong. People don't join because they can't afford it. The GOP plan does nothing to address that.
Completely out of touch. Next town hall is?
Republicans don't understand PEOPLE. At most, working class person may get a few hundred  'tax credit'. NOT enough for insurance
Clueless. Listen to your constituents (not just the rich white ones) and you might start to understand how absurd this is.
I just sneezed..BS.
Republicans have another think coming.
Plenty of people think things that aren't true.
3 @JohnCornyn would you allow and or want your young adult children or grandchildren to go uninsured? No of course not. Not brutal.
BS. Plus 'refundable tax credits' (aka subsidies) barely acct 4 income & don't acct 4 cost of plan-which varies by location.
2 @JohnCornyn are happy to be insured as they realize stuff happens. Young healthy people get cancer, have accidents… need to be covered.
No brute force in mandate. Just common sense and math. @JohnCornyn Can’t cover preexisting w/out it. My young adult healthy children 1
.@JohnCornyn In what world will a young healthy person sign up for insurance they don't think they need?  Not the real one.
there are many things "worth the cost" but that does not equate with affordability when one is poor
Russia trump independent investigate
Sir, this shows how skewed the GOP's thinking is. Bless your heart.
How the f*** are the poor supposed to afford it with some assistance! Do you call yourself a Christian?
.@JohnCornyn @realDonaldTrump Entitlements that legitimize illegal aliens delegitimize everything. #ACA #AHCA #Ryancare #FREE #Obamacare
REPUBLICANS ARE STUPID! Pushing this moronic plan proves it!
your rhetoric demonstrates  NO CONCEPT of understanding choices the poor must make. NONE.
Honestly I want to give you the benefit of the doubt but you just won't let me.
No one except selfish GOP thinks this.
I hope the GOP plan is all the lines of Trumps plan that is why we elected you to REPEAL and REPLACE unaffordable Obamacare
What do you get in return for selling the ridiculous plan to the people of Texas? How much  $$$ huh?
Those people who can't afford to get in don't care about your so-called choices
even conservative groups know this bill is trash.  You don't even have AARP on board.  They can see this only helps the wealthy.
Wrong! They can't afford the cost, stop lying.  It'll NEVER be affordable w/this plan. It would be worthless w/high deduct's.
ACA is not w/o flaw but "brute force" better describes what you're doing to states with this monstrosity. Explain in town halls.
WHAT? Do you realize how may of your voters will LOSE coverage because of the cost & cuts in benefits. @SenSanders @JoeNBC @msn
