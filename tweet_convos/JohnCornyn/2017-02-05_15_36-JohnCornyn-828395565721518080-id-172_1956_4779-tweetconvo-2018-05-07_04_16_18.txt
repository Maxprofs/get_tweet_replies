@jgm41 @AtlantaFalcons uh
Gpd Bless Pres. Geo.HW Bush & Mrs. Bush! SO glad they were able to do this with their typical graciousness & smiles!
Bawling. That was so wonderful. God bless them.
It was great to hear and see them both out there, they are great American People that will both be rembered for.
I hope they let him keep the coin
I respect him as the former President even if I didn't vote for him.  He is a class act and Barbara Bush is too.
I am proud to say that I voted for him twice and also his son twice!  The entire family are a class act!  <3

How fitting that a true Patriot of the USA be the one to toss the coin.  God Bless us all.
Nasty old war criminal.
presidential grace and a wife's love for the win. Bring back presidential demeanor and class.
It only left a few weeks ago - it is a shame what's going on now!!
This is not the place for this. Please, leave the negativity at the door and just appreciate today.
I lean democrat but I love this man
Great way to start! thank you NFL. This is what America should be like everyday! Patriotism & Respect.

Back when presidents were presidential. Good man.
from the icu to the 50yd line in 1 week.  Amazing
Texans are Tough.
we ain't perfect but we are tough. And there's a difference between stubborn and tough.
Jeb should have been prez
YES! Jeb would be great President! Love Bush Family!
Even he had the common sense to break party lines to support HRC!
Beautiful !!!!!! Loved it.
It's great to know this nation has a family that shows it's true love & values. No matter what they love each other
