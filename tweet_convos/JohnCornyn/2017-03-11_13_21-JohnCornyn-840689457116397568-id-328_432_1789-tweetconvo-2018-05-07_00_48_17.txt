absolutely false. Some yes. All...not even close
Sorry THIS IS Lyinest Bunch I've Ever Seen! Name 1 Truth! Fact: NEROS Cost MORE 60DAYS Than PBO & BIDEN Did In 8 Yrs!
The "new" healthcare plan is more socialistic crap forced on us by our govt. When will we take our country Back??
Give them a chance, "Ballz"...... every new thing has some kinks to work out.   Like we had a choice with Obamacare!
We have a choice now...don't do it. The plan is a disaster.
.... We do have a choice, and it's to go ahead! To do nothing is disaster and leaves "Obama's legacy" intact. No way!
Either way leaves a disaster...this is poorly modified Obamacare. It is a disaster. No true conservative can approv
... It's a lot LESS of a "disaster" than Obama-no-care" which is disintegrating before our eyes. I'm a Conservative!
Unless you are a 63 year old who makes $25,600 per year.  Paying $14,800 annually for insurance will suck
No argument from me. I want govt totally out of healthcare. It can't cost effectively  walk a letter across the street.
Drumpf Has Taken Decisive Action 2 Protect American Jobs & Workers!? Using RUSSIAN STEEL? Lyin Jerk! MUSSRGA W/Russian Steel!
That's GOP Propagandists LIES. Women Don't Pay MORE. Preexisting Conditions DONT EXIST. NO CAPS ON CARE. THOSE 3 MOST IMPORTANT
and TrumpCare is going to fix it by giving tax cuts to the rich? And making it more expensive for the poor?
fix what is wrong BUT don't punish seniors or disabled
@pm9dcr @VP repeal repeal repeal stop trying to Polish a terd
Hopefully They will have all cost down for all Americans to pay the same for the Poor people.change down on medicare
... said by none of the 20M people that now have healthcare
Healthcare through Obamacare? How do you afford it and the deductible? You must be very rich!! WTF!
Do you work in the healthcare industry?
Nope
LMAO!! Then how can you talk about something you know nothing about? Interesting.
@JohnCornyn @VP john, just give us your insurance policy.
@alana_50  so, your son and BIL are freeloaders. They're welcome.
I do not understand this comment. You drive on roads paid for by taxes. Does that make you a free loader?
btw, I live in a state with one of the highest taxes and shitty roads.
Oklahoma?
@JohnCornyn @VP nope, my premiums decreased.
did we believe Obama admin and the Dems tell the truth?
@JohnCornyn Every promise of quick repeal has been broken. #trumpcare : broken #ryancare  : broken
#CornynTheCimmerian

Seven of our doctors quit stating reason Obama Care! To much Gov control on care they could give patients, to much paper work
I lost one of my Drs. Do to Obama care! She had to close her practice and ended up working on a army base
Why ThrowBaby Out W/Bath? Fix It. Repealed We Lose Good 2 & We'll NEVER Get Back NO CAPSNoPreexistingConditions
& .@realDonaldTrump has broken his promise that everyone would be covered under Trumpcare.  They won't. #Trumpcare
He never said everyone would. Oboma made this claim because HE made it a law. Now we have a choice
oh yes he did.  There is video of him saying everyone would be covered.  He lied.
If, if they wanted to pertisipate. Oboma made it a law you HAD to have insurance.
under Trumpcare if you have a lapse of over 30 days off ins. U pay 30% hike in your premium.
Face the nation, today it was stated insurance is not mandatory.
the govt. penalty is a lot less than the ins. co. penalty.  You're getting screwed!
NO mandates. Pass a "clean" healthcare bill the States and People can support.....
RINOCARE is no better
what part of that would u disagree with @SenBookerOffice ?
Then why are you keeping the core of it?
all said is true. Obama HC destroyed HCno surprise he saidwanted 2redo foundations. But what is new plan doing to actually fix it ?
@JohnCornyn @VP and virtually every promise of a better plan is broken w/ the new plan rolled out by GOP. #DoBetter
We already have govt. funded health care called Medicaid why not expand what we have. Repeal Obamacare Care !
@JohnCornyn @VP STOP SHAMEFUL LYING
Insuring 20 million. Lowest insured rate ever. @CNN @ABC @AP And if people hate it, why are the GOP being yelled at in Townhalls?. @cnbc
I'd like it to crash and burn then let the dems+ come begging for help!
@JohnCornyn @VP Thanks to you @GOP. And yet it still managed to provide affordable care for 20M Americans.
Were people able to keep their doctors of preference? That was a big promise.. not sure if it was fulfilled.
probably obamas biggest lie
@JohnCornyn @VP ...partially because the GOP cut off some of its supporting legislation. #dontrepealaca
Agree
that he wears China made Trump ties with Sean Hannity
#trumpcare #ryancare is the hammer to fix this
I am afraid the only choices are market  based with gaps or socialized with more gaps but lower quality.
@TrumpResults @VP Yes, we know!! Obamacare = Disaster 
Ryan plan worst than Obama care
BWAHAHAHAHA !!! Pence acting butt hurt about "broken promises" ... that's rich! 
The key fact they can't get around: more Americans are insured since AHA then at any point in US history. That's a good thing
these things are not the fault of the AHA but greedy health ins Co. Or GOP lawmakers who tried at every step to damage law.
maybe but you are hurting low income, seniors,legit medicaid users, disabled.this Trump supporter is disgusted. Horrible
Lies.  Pre-existing conditions.  Insurance until 26.  Expanded Medicare & Medicaid. Repair NOT replace.
We all know Obamacare sucks- let's not simply rebrand same old same old #ObamacareLite
At least OBama care helped the poor. You plan to allow  medical insurance companies to stop  medical cover of poor Americans
blanket false statements by trumps admin. The new norm
Promises broken...because the GOP decided to fight ObamaCare instead of fix it.  And now we have TrumpCare...
@VPLast year my SS check went down by $50.00 Obama this year went up 50, but with new Ins. chg. I got $9.00 all do to Obama.
we need laws to control the insurance companies they are the big problem.
but that's a flat out lie. Pence &Ryan are lying. They don't want to spend money on poor or seniors. Their plan will screw us.
Let's see how #trumpcare does.
@JohnCornyn @VP you are an American senator please use real news sources and not borderline propaganda
The Antichrist speaks with a forked tongue....
if ACA isn't funded it will fell dork da
you go VP Pence! You are so active and visible to the Anerican people and I personally am so happy and proud to hear you input
Trump is 51 days in, Republicans in Congress need to unite & repeal OBAMACARE! As PROMISED !
This is horse shit. America is being sold a lemon by the GOP.
Pence there was once an ounce of respect for you - now you are just another putts
yes except one fundamental promise which is healthcare is a right not a privilege.
bullshit, Mike.
@JohnCornyn @VP @SpeakerRyan 
Millionaires Will Get $157 Billion In Tax Cuts If Republicans Repeal & Replace, #RyanDoesntCare
@JohnCornyn @VP Jesus, these Conservatives lie a lot.
B.S.
@JohnCornyn @VP If it wasn't for the ACÁ, this conversation wouldn't be happening. B/C there would be NO health ins access for all.
Faux News, perfect place from which to tell the American people more lies. Can't wait til you people are gone.
WE LOVE YOU @VP Keep up the good work. I've a feeling you & @POTUS are list-makers! You sure are checking them off 4 1st!
Not only broken promises but not enough qualified doctors & nurses. Americans pay more & good health care is hard to find.
I kept my health plan that promise wasn't broken to me.
Yeah, because of the constant attacks of repubs to make sure it failed. You know you're not patriots, don't you?
.@FoxNews .@JohnCornyn .@VP From the lips that that said “They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States’ about Flynn.
@JohnCornyn @VP You misspelled Trump.
Obomacare was a hoax from the start. On top of this it screwed up ALL other aspects of health ins. Everyone got  exploited.
"Virtually every promise *45 made has been broken"  let's start with "drain the swamp.  #RESIST
Ok...you want a cookie Pence?
yes repeal, replacement just another entitlement, a Paul Ryan establishment plan, Paul's so much better!
Blaming the old plan will only work so long.
New RINOCARE even worse, if pass!
just repeal it. Fed govt does not belong in healthcare.

#himmler
@JohnCornyn @VP Pence lied about Flynn. You're all going to prison.
@JohnCornyn @VP more people insured w better coverage w no preexisting conditions w children and women covered-you are in the wrong
Virtually every promise on the repeal of Obamacare has been broken.  They forgot "repeal."
@JohnCornyn @VP every part of Trumpcare is broken. Fix the ACA not replace it.
@JohnCornyn @VP , the deaths of thousands of people will be on your hands when you take away their insurance.  Voters won't forget.
@JohnCornyn @VP more alternative facts . Just stop with the partisan crap and work for America! Single payer system NOW!
pay for your own damn insurance if you want it then it is single payer.
I do pay my own, but I care about others. My insurance is in no danger from #TrumpCARELESS , but thanks for your concern 
Obama Care promised health care to more and has delivered. TrumpCare promises health care to the rich and will deliver.
and your breaking a promise to repeal and replace. It's just Obama Care light.
you can fool some of the people all of the time, but smart well read people, you can't fool at all!
did you look at the #of people with health care now compared to BEFORE the ACA - you tools!
.@JohnCornyn @VP Interesting claim given that it helps 22M Americans John, with People like you John doing everything to crush it.
can't get rid of it fast enough.
that's not true and I was on it. I had cancer twice and it has given me a chance to live again. Itneeds to be fixed not tornup
Funny how Americans see it as the best thing to ever happen. Are you betting your career on this?
umm nope republicans did it stupid
Noproblem now ball is in your court..u r Government.Fulfill your promises &show u can make America great& prosperous citizens.
@JohnCornyn @VP Such as?
THEN MAKE IT BETTER INSTEAD OF WORSE!!  DO YOUR JOB
Obamacare for me= $157/mo for two of us. The Gov't pays $1100/mo. If I leave my county I have no insurance. Great coverage?
and DEMs don't care!
trumpcare keeps no promises
Let Trump do his job! The health care we have now I can not maintain. My family is going broke!!
Government Does Not belong in health care, gov't screws up everything they touch. Let ACA die, start preventive care!
Indiana is 38th in the Nation for personal income. Way to go Pence. Statistic to be proud of don't you think 
Do not delete across state line competition, u might as well keep ACA.  Do not expand Medicaid, cut the taxes!!!
Because Of Republicans .. We Are Going To Hold You Accountable
i doubt those folks on ObamaCare agree with you and their voices mean more then yours does
Americans pray for President. Restricted state lines, dictated policy, drug cost & deductible are killing our health system.@FoxNews @VP
so did the United States everything you promised you deliver to your own people.
do you even talk to real people?
@JohnCornyn @VP Mexico will pay for the wall.
@JohnCornyn @VP 9 golf trips.
will you and Congress be switching to this new American health care program.If not,why should we the ppl accept it?
If 1/3 of state is on medicade. it means they have NO money.  Taking it away will leave them 0 . Can't afford to bu any plan.
for such a GOD fearing man he sure has no problem with all the lies Trump's administration dish out.
"Virtually every promise..." The credibility of the WH is rapidly waning.
we keep how bad #Obamacare & now when the GOP gets a chance they messin up so far
Even the Antichrist is a lair...
@JohnCornyn @VP Please tally the "promises" of Trump? Please?
@JohnCornyn @VP  but current #Ryancare  is not a solution. FIX IT! Total repeal. Kill Medicaid. Use Medicare A. #ObamacareLite
@JohnCornyn @VP Since the @VP lied about not knowing Flynn was a foreign agent, he lost his credibility.
The problem (see photo) & the doctors have the solution to good healthcare for ALL of us.  https://www.healthcare-now.org/what-is-single-payer/ …
due to lies misinformation & legislation changes brought to you and yours by the Republican  & conservatives thanks for caring?
that's right! Except the part about being affordable healthcare!!
@realDonaldTrump SO #NOobamaLight No RYAN PLAN. I agree with @RandPaul & Americans & @RealAlexJones @infowars
it will be helpful to summarize the ways The ACA broke every promise.  Don't hide behind "virtually". Ur lying
don't worry the American people will keep their promise #impeachment
The TRUTH is marching on!
... by republicans.
That's how it's looking. :(
u mean like Trump Like no one will lose healthcare? Like no one will lose Medicare? Will get rid of corruption like his admin?
@POTUS 
Dear VP Pence: The American people want the same health insurance plan that you have. Nothing less.
seriously, we all know the GOP set it up to fail. #fixit #easiertofix
pretty much O was a phoney and fraud
So sad and so true
except the alimportant one 10's of thousands of people have healthcare now and won't when you're  done. AmeriKKKa was great
@JohnCornyn @VP @realDonaldTrump Let's see how many promises TrumpDon'tCare breaks
@JohnCornyn @VP Giving HUGE tax breaks to the wealthy and taking Healthcare from the poor should fix everything
What a lie! Why can't this admin ever sell through their ideas without knocking something down? Just say, we have a better idea
Your lies will catch up with you.When the poor voters lose their coverages or pay higher premiums. They will vote their pockets
@JohnCornyn @VP lies lies lies. How many times will you keep lying? You only want to get rich old white dudes richer.
that's not true. It's an unnecessary lie. You can sell your plan without lies. Why. Do. You. Lie? #WeCanDoBetter
I'm sorry Obama and his cronies had the biggest lie! Nothing he promised happened? Keep your doc and low cost WTF
this is what a wolf in sheeps clothing looks and sounds like
And you through together a package to take care of the wealthy make lower income pay more for less coverage. It's not better
and giving25 billion to big pharma and billions to millionares is better?
for shame calls himself a Christian..liar
such a liar
@ A friend of mine, who has 4 daughters just dropped health insurance due to the $2000 per month premium. Plus the ded was $6400.
Ryan plan sucks, mandate penalty to the insurance company?? Craziness.  Won't release which LOBBYISTS WROTE this bill??? BS
You're being sold a lemon. Don't be a dupe.
I'm thinking by replacing it their letting Obama and dems off the hook.  Anyone can see it can't support itself.
@JohnCornyn @VP because of Obama care I'm alive and not drowning in medical debt. #ThanksObama
No. I'm drowning in your debt for you.
fox news continues their lies, would support a Republican president who said swamp water laced with poison it's healthy.
@JohnCornyn @VP And the AHCA breaks every promise Trump made for 'beautiful,' more affordable, less expensive insurance coverage.
How are people 50+ supposed to pay 5x more than young people for insurance till they are eligible for Medicare?
You are lying Mr Pence.
@FoxNews @VP
liar
FOX LIE CHANNEL , TIME FOR FOX TO BE EXPELLED FROM AMERICA .ALL THEY DO IS LIE .
SOP for Obama & his legatees; the new, disgraceful, anti-American, noisy but declining, Democratic Party
utter bs
Lets just hope the Repub's promises to do a better & more affordable plan r not broken too.
@JohnCornyn @VP I guess we are going to pretend that R's did nothing to make sure the ACA  would die out.
ACA was a piece of crap, I know, I had it for 2 years!!
Are you blaming higher prices on the system? Try again.
