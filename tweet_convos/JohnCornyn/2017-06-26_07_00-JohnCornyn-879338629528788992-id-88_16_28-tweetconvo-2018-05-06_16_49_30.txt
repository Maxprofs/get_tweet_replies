Cornyn: "We don’t have the luxury of waiting around"
That's because the more folks learn about this vile bill, the less popular it becomes
Hey John Cornyn Staff. Did you notice how there isn't a single response that supports Trumpcare?  Tell the Senator.
It's funny to me that you note this issue but seem to think kicking 22mil (CBO estimate) off of insurance is an acceptable solution.
tell President Koch-brothers that it's called TrumpCare (@realDonaldTrump)
Single payer.
Thanks to the GOP
@POTUS stopped paying subsidies, of course they are pulling out. Crooked Trump
The purpose of the Senate healthcare bill is to save tax dollars by expediting the deaths of millions of Americans.
So your strategy of killing the ACA so you can shove the GOP's horrendous replacement down America's throats is working...yippee...
And how many rural countries will have their hospital & clinics close because of Medicaid cuts??? Even ppl with insur will have no providers
Who can we thank for that? Trump & the GOP
More GOP hypocrisy.  You can easily stop sabotaging ACA to stop this.
Yes, due to sabotage from the Trump administration. Insurance markets will not stabilize with GOP instigating uncertainty. Repair ACA.
14% of the counties in Texas don't have a doctor. That means that more people in Texas have health insurance than health care.
You own it and now you'll take healthcare from millions to give tax breaks to the wealthy
At least they have insurance, your HC bill will ensure millions lose coverage!
it was working for the majority till the GOP  it
#fakenews
If you only read the responses to every tweet you put out you would change your mind. Alas you are hopeless and #OutIn20 #NoAHCA #NoBCRA
Trading tax cuts for 400 richest fams over 750,000 citizens health & wellbeing. How do you sleep at night?
That's the kind of shit y'all need to be working on! We know that's insurance greed nothing else...get on your J O B!
#MedicareForAll! Roughly 100% of working Americans pay an average of $5 to Federal Medicare Tax. You don't know that because you don't work.
I believe if Dems and Repubs starting acting in constituents best interest, they could improve the ACA

Senate health bill to push nursing home residents off Medicaid. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/24/science/medicaid-cutbacks-elderly-nursing-homes.html?ex_cid=SigDig&_r=0 …
What does your bill do?
And your bill does nothing to change that. Stop lying and #DoYourJob.
Well then lets pander 2 insurers & gut our health care. I had hoped Trump would b the one to make pharma and insurance reform. Guess not.
Why isn't the President using his 'great' negotiation skills to persuade them to stay? I thought this was his specialty.
Quite sabotaging  OBAMACARE
I counted 8 of these 35 or so individual replies as in support of your bill, Senator.  Are you listening to your constituents?
So much for Obama's choice comments.
How many insurers can U predict with Trumpcare and how many elderly will B impacted @indivisibletxjc @MSNBC @indtx36
Fix it. Allow purchase across state lines. Better yet, #SinglePayer #NonProfitHealthcare #HouBouDat
Meanwhile, in YOUR STATE:

4,700,00 rely on Medicaid
913,000 Texan's will lose coverage
2,100,000 children will see lifetime limits return
no maternity coverage,mental health,no  preexisting conditions, no cap on premiums=strong incentives for extra insurance company profits
Yes, because the GOP assisted in loss  of funding . Be honest- the GOP created this funding loss  to kill the ACA & give us Trumpcare.
You should come to my hospital and tell the babies in the NICU and the toddlers in the hem/onc Unit about lifetime limits. #TurnTXBlue
You realize that under your TrumpCare tax cut that 50 million+ Americans will have ZERO insurance options, yes? You get that, right, John?
And with the senate's bill they'll have what? More choices at a higher cost? Btw how much are the Koch bros giving you?
Misleading as counties vary in size and population. What percentage of population?
Senator, how did you and members of congress decide upon your own health care insurance benefits? You made sure to have a sweet deal ...
Let's get govt out of the healthcare business! Repeal ACA!
... thanks to @GOP sabotage.
If only those states expanded Medicaid
Such a victim mentality. Do something to shore up the existing plan, without giving a tax cut to your donors. Be a hero, do the right thing.
Because you, @realDonaldTrump and the rest of @GOP have made it easy for pharm and ins companies to charge too much and pay you $180,000!!!
Yet, somehow, Obamacare is still BETTER than what you are offering!!
Four words added to this bill will make everyone happy;"States can opt out."If not20-30States are going to be suing the Feds no matter what.
but 99% of industrialized COUNTRIES have socialized medicine, and vastly better outcomes! #Wealthcare
It's funny how you and your ilk can point out oodles of flaws about the #ACA  but can't say one real thing about your B.S. bill
If you miss a payment, you will have to wait 6 months to reinstate coverage under Senate plan.
And in Texas? Your state?
Largely because Republican governors refused to accept Medicaid funding.
Yep. & this is exactly why TX is so screwed. All R leadership. It's abt to be even harder to be poor in TX. Shame.
So fix what is broken in the ACA. You're hurting the American people.
Even fewer people will be insured under the current GOP plan. It is not a 'health care' bill, it is a tax cut for your cronies and big $$.
Fix it. Don't repeal it. We need to look to a single payer system instead of throwing out the baby with the bathwater.

Obamacare was designed to fail and cause chaos when the imam in chief left office.Typical community organizer fraud.

Like magic, pulling billions out of the system designed to help the poor while leaving Obamacare structure in place will fix that?
Perhaps if y'all weren't defunding and destabilizing the market they'd stick around better.
How many in states that refused the Medicaid Expansion? How many since the Repubs started promising to end the mandate. Sabotage. #SaveACA
Then  fix it! You're in charge - stop sabotaging it. Everyone in the United States should have access to healthcare!
100% of counties will have less beneficial healthcare coverage w/out of control prices with the Senate's new "healthcare" bill.
Here's what a long term GOP senator accomplished in Texas,
You know as well as we do, the uncertainty that you and your people have created is reason Health insurance is pulling out.
That's bc Trump is pressuring them to pull out of the market. You shld try another tact to defend yourself. You sound defensive. #TurnTXBlue
24 million people could have no insurance at all.  Only one provider doesn't seem so bad...
Meanwhile, how was your meeting with the Kochs? Is THIS how "transparent governance" is supposed to work?
#kochlicker should be a thing, right?
AMAZING still not defending what you are supporting! Specifically what in the bill is designed to reduce premiums? I can't find it!
This is like me blasting the heat and then promoting the fact that it's hot...
And you're trimming the fringes of #Obamacare.  Thanks for nothing. #FullRepeal

The GOP health bill isn’t just about Obamacare. It changes Medicaid forever. Here’s who Medicaid covers. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/21/upshot/gop-health-plan-is-really-a-rollback-of-medicaid.html?_r=1 … @haeyoun
