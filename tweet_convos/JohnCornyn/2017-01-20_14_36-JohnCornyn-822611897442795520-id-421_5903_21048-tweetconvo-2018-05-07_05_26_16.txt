GOP works for KGB. Sold out AMERICA to RUSSIA! So SAD! REAL AMERICANS will ALWAYS remember the TRAITORS! Republican COWARDS!
Just another TRAITOR or a RUSSIAN SPY? Selling out REAL AMERICANS to PUTIN! COWARD and a LOSER! So SAD!
You, Donny and Putin all the SAME! HATE AMERICA! HATE MINORITIES! HATE WOMEN! HATE ENVIRONMENT! So SAD! LOSERS!
dummy, thats the liberal spin. TRUMP is for all AMERICANS. Leave US if you dont like it
Like GOP, Trump is anti-gay, anti-minority, anti-women. He's a sexualual predator, too!
non of that is true
Congrats to the gop for picking the best guy for the job. I'm impressed, you usually screw that up. @GOP @tomesimpson
ooh rah! Mad dog is going to kick some extremist ass! Bye bye terrorist! We are coming for you.
As USMC family, it's my brothers who are the tip of that spear. @chindia5150 @GOP @tomesimpson
Thank you!
You're welcome. It's our honor to defend this nation. @Leenn61 @chindia5150 @GOP @tomesimpson
