You are not listening, sir. Do you even read the responses to your tweets?
cut taxes and drive us further into debt is not reform
like it has over the past 7 years? You've got to try harder man.
That's a laugh.
lol. Dot coms drove eco for Clinton then he and Dems gave us housing bubble and 9/11. Thanks
Hmmm. No town hall in Houston or San Antonio. Where exactly are you meeting with constituents?
Tell us your thoughts on investigating Trump and Russian connection.  Letâ€™s do a town hall!  C'mon, John: you represent US.
Why is it that the economy is doing so much better now than 8 years ago?
Hasn't anyone told you in the last 40yrs trickle down only increases income gap btw workers and owners?
no they are not ! Nothing in the books
You, sir, are not representing your constituency. Schedule a #TownHall.
now if only you'd work with YOUR CONSTITUENTS
I'm a Texas voter so you work for me: get IRS to release Trump's tax returns NOW
How about we just get rid of an unnecessary agency? The tax code currently makes filling your taxes optional.
... and create MASSIVE deficits.  Because that's always the Retardlican solution. Lower taxes, less revenue and higher deficits.
More welfare for billionaires. Yay! Tired old GOP con game.
do not undermine the  role of the press. if  the report is not accurate then refute it with facts. don't be a Bannon parrot
Yes, we need a town hall meeting!!
such as? Cite specific examples
check labor stats from last 8 years to see how to do that well!!
go rich people, amiright?!?!
you must be kidding?! How about taxing the corporations and extremely wealthy and rebuilding our states' schools?!
tax the top, John.  It's easy!
Yeah, from the group that brought you the 2008 financial crash. GOP: the Sequel. More policies for the one percent. #resist
when are you up for reelection? Gonna be fun to see how much not listening to us now is worth
.@JohnCornyn so you're actually going to make sure no company or millionaire can take tax loops and instead make them pay their fair share?
Time for you to be flipped like a pancake.
You do remember you work for us, right? Come home. #TownHall
Tax Code is a extremely important topic for a #TownHall.  I would love to talk to you about the #widowpenalty in the tax code.
Same situation
so you're gonna cut taxes for the poor and raise them on the super-rich?
Working with POTUS? In what way? Watching TV with him and tweeting? That's all he does. Well, and crow.
Lack of transparency of who gave you $$ is more of a problem.
can you promise to make it so people like @POTUS actually have to pay taxes so that it will lower my burden?
I hope Rs are working with the house and not just house republicans, both parties matter.. #unitedontdivide
Why don't you schedule a townhall meeting with your constituents? You do have quite a lot to explain.
Good, because Obama sure had us in an economic mess. Oh wait, that was the last Rs that put us in an economic meltdown. SMH
more tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations?   Don't call it trickle down  economics.
translation: we're reviving "trickle down economics" since everyone knows TDE is junk
How about Dems let you guys achieve a few pet agenda items real quick, and then y'all impeach Trump because no-one needs him?

you are working to give yourself and your owners more tax breaks
what about the investigation into Russian involvement in US election
what about the investigation into the Russian involvement in US election?
Just don't cut taxes for the wealthy. They have plenty cut taxes for lower & middle class. From San Angelo.
will the Donald actually pay taxes, and may we please see his returns.
so the rich can get richer
you mean tariff tax revenue rather than raising taxes on the wealthy 1% I bet.
Do you mean the middle class get poorer and the rich get richer.  Fight for the majority, you as well @tedcruz
- meaning big biz can make more money to give to you. U have no regard for the middle/lower financial brackets #uworkforus
Does this include repealing business property taxes for incoming businesses that wind up losing the state money?
as a solo practitioner, I would GREATLY appreciate a simpler code. Thanks Rs  and @POTUS !! #draintheswamp & #drainthetaxcode !
   but concerned no way to reform a broken system. In the business world that approach almost always fails.  #FairTax
Cornyn = Crony
77070 Houston. When are the town hall meetings, John? Please send dates and locations.
How much did nose grow after that statement?
according to report on NPR's MarketPlace 'nothing is happening there'. Prove me wrong show something like  a proposal
can we discuss in town hall in Houston?
if you won't respond to emails, calls, visits, letters, I guess it's time to elect someone who will? Your time is limited!
the only voter enthusiasm you have are droves of ppl ready 2 defeat u, donate to your opponent, and vote against you in primary
your wrecklessness and soul selling to Trump won't be forgotten when re-election comes. Voter enthusiasm wins. You have none.
why don't you schedule a town hall when congress breaks and your colleagues do? You only want to hear from us for $ and votes.
rather than serve as a champion of Texans, you've built a career bowing down to lobbyists, dark $$, donors, and corporations.
You work for us. We elected you and have paid your salary for 33 years and your 3 taxpayer funded pensions. Do your job.
You took an oath to the people of Texas. Stop hiding, calling security on constituents, refusing to listen to the people.
shame on you, senator, for continuing to put party before country. You are a corporate shill and Wall Street lapdog.
Big John is hoping the crazies in the GOP get rid of the 17th amendment, so he won't have to EVER answer to us. #TrumpTraitor
press office said that if Texans want to meet with their Senator, they are welcome to visit his D.C. office on Thursdays. #swamp
Awesome! I assume that making huge corporations pay their fair share is part of this progress?
you need to hold town halls so constituents can tell you what's important to us. Right now it looks like you arent listening!
meanwhile healthcare for the poor, elderly and children are not important to u
Tax cuts don't create jobs - they're at best neutral. Almost all economists agree, yet here is @JohnCornyn insisting rich ppl need more $$$
Australian Prime Minister @TurnbullMalcolm has the same "I.Q problem". #Politics #taxes #Jobs
How will they pay for the tax cuts? Unfunded??
Please respond to your constituents questions about the president's violations of the constitution.
Trickledown doesn't work you know.
Senate Republicans are working very hard to make the rich richer, and to hell with the rest of us.  #resist
You know damn well you're just trying to make you and your friends richer. We can all see it, stop the act, man.
Why didn't you do it during President George W. Bush's administration when you pushed through Medicare Part D?
stop your distractions and support an independent investigation with subpoena power.
I hope you are looking at ways to help ALL Americans with the new tax code.  Not just those at the top of the pyramid. Seriously
Just once, place the interests of Texas ahead of party loyalty. Just once. For the sake of the people who voted for you.
Healthcare for all will allow businesses - esp small biz - to focus on growth and job creation. An employeed CPA does our taxes.
seems like it has been growing jobs for a while now... like 8 years.
.@JohnCornyn Propose 1 low, flat rate (15%?) same for companies and ppl, 1st ~$20k exempt, no deductions, cap gains indexed for inflation
AKA - Fucking over the middle class and giving handouts to the rich. #SwampPeople
Republicans support our crazy POTUS.  #RepublicansOwnThisMess
It seems to me that there should be more effort in congress to protect the country from POTUS, dementia SAD
#POTUSiscrazy  Why are you working with a crazy person?
In case you missed yesterday's news conference, POTUS is insane.
should be working with @SenateDems to ensure ethical government instead of being a party > country guy...
but will it be equitable? Or will the rich (aka the Donald Trumps et al) be allowed to continue to pay a pittance?
Trickle down economics doesn't work. Giving the wealthy more tax breaks doesn't work. It hasn't worked EVER.
i hear there is a 2 month time deadline  U can do this, meet the deadline and make it right.  your staff meet deadlines, u can 2
but, the economy is growing. You're just trying to line your pockets more...
Keep up the GREAT job, Senator. Keep in mind that you are a target of a professional astroturf #FakeAccount Twitter campaign.
You know, like the President has claimed to do?  Not that we know, he won't release his tax returns.
Does that mean that we're actually going to charge the 1% a fair rate and not let them loophole their way out of paying taxes?
but job growth has already grown steadily over last 8 yrs? Are we still trying to give huge breaks to top 1%? Still doesn't work
Call it what it really is.  It's not tax reform - its trickle down economics, and it doesn't work.
If you, Agent Orange & other FOOLS would READ the "FAKE" sorry "VERY FAKE" news U realize our economy is GOOD.  PO!
So increase taxes for the wealthy, yes? Because trickle down economics doesn't work.
So glad you're working but since recess has stated when is the #TownHall? P.S. Wish Senate Rs had worked this hard with 44.
Hey, chickens&*t. Hold a town hall meeting. Afraid of your constituents? Lol.
I left you ANOTHER message today. #TownHall #HearOurVoice
like taking away consumer protections and regulations that keep our financial system from another meltdown? #shorttermmemory
I'm not positive you have my best interests in mind, considering DeVos, but feel free to come to Texas and teach me.
thanks for bringing up taxes. Where are the presidents?
Are you a able to multi-task? How 'bout Russian hacking AND Trump's conflicts of interest? And his insane lie-filled press conf
This should be a great subject for a town hall. I'd like to know how it is going to affect my company. I hope you are informed.
so the wealthy are going to pay their fair share? And you'll get rid of all the corporate loopholes and unnecessary subsidies?
We have Russians in the Senate already? Hard to keep up with the news.
Pretty sure it will create at least one job since we will vote you out in 2020. When is that town hall, Senator?
is this more trickle down fantasy?
Hey John, investigation into POTUS ties to Russia would be Truly productive. Quit grandstanding & defend Constitution. Resume?
you sir do know that the proposed changes are only going to help the rich get richer. Poor pay more! 
PS- I read that junk that OFA & other grps are encouraging violence. I'm involved w/many grps & have NEVER heard that. Absurd.
it takes me 3 days to fill out my taxes. Please simplify and end Obamacare tax + paperwork burden.
What about our national security?  Needs fixing IMMEDIATELY!
#BREAKING Germany warns US against threatening EU cohesion
why did Flynn lied to the FBI and and it's not a big deal
do you mean cuts for the 1%
Doesn't matter how much richer the rich get. Citizens paid a wage they can't support themselves on w/o healthcare are doomed.
no corp cuts! Too many loopholes.
Trickle down has been disproven.

Unemployment has been minimally lower only 10 years over the past 50.

Stop with the voodoo.
It's about time. Look forward to reviewing the result.
Can you have somebody give the Kremlin my address so they know where to mail my tax refund check?
if you want to talk taxes, I'm all for it. Let's start with 45's taxes.
Thank you. Please repeal inheritance tax. My family will gain $5mil and momma needs a new vacation home...er..to create "jobs".
how's that investigation on Russia going?
We demand a town hall! #TownHall #HearOurVoices #Democracy
Right. Blind leading the blind. I mean, rich leading the rich.
So the rich can get richer as the middle class melts away like the icebergs.
When is your town hall?
@alfranken  Dont talk about our tax code behind its back
Counterproductive is code for "not weak enough to make billionaires happy." Not a billionaire? Then Cornyn is deaf to you.
Will John McCain join the group? He's beginning to look like a traitor.
Why aren't you and your buddy @SenTedCruz not doing townhalls? Scared of the people?
Call it what it is: TAX BREAKS for billionaire @GOP donors. How the voters don't see and vote against this is beyond me. Wake up
that's code for...we found another way to erode support for the middle class while benefitting my wealthy handlers
I'm from 78216. Not a paid protester - one of your real life constituents. When is your next town hall Senator?
I see Trump working. I don't see a lot of work coming out of the senate or house. Get busy and keep up!
do relieve Puerto Rico, eliminating requirement of all goods to PR 2 pass through CONUS.
At the expense of?  There are always casualties when the Republicans do things.  Heavy losses are to be expected.
When can we see the  plan?
what you mean is more tax cuts for the rich. The way you grow the econ is put money in the people's hands, not more to the rich
your silence on @POTUS  behavior is very telling. Every word energizes your opposition
and btw, you should really be working on getting an investigation into Russian interference and influence up and running....
98% of the population does not care about making 2% more money when PEOPLE HAVE TO DIE IN THE STREETS for it to happen!
you do know that unemployment is at historic lows. Who exactly is gonna do the jobs @gop creates? Mexicans?
No, you are doing it to benefit your wallets and the wallets of the 1%.  Don't try to kid us, we know better.
yes to give the 1 percent the biggest tax break. Trickle down economics doesn't work. Hasn't in the past and it won't now.
Recess next week; how many town halls are you going to have throughout the great state of Texas?
15% flat tax across the board
.@JohnCornyn whose economy? Russia's? Mar-a-Lago? Trump Towers? GOP are supporting a hostile nation right now and selling out U.S.
the ONLY WAY to prove you, personally, are not working against our country is to support a SPECIAL COMMITTEE to investigate.
if you REALLY WANT to make our state and country better, you have to start by rebuilding trust. More than half the country 1/
does not trust you. How long do you really think that is sustainable?

@JohnCornyn #jobs
how about a 7 page tax code? compared to the 70,000 page behemoth we currently have. 7 pages is more than enough
what were you doing the last 8 years?
Thank you for your work on reforming tax code. Much needed!
And make the rich richer and the poor poorer and without healthcare.
looking forward To hearing your positions on border taxes with Mexico and selling cross border power.
Speaking of taxes...I just remembered someone promised to release their taxes...who was it?...ummm...oh, right! #TaxMarch
The number one problem with our tax code is that we let rich people & corporations off the hook for supporting our country.
thank you for not saying "grow the economy"
Until we see POTUS's tax returns, we can assume it's been working out great for him.
Is all of your congressional decision-making now without any input from your constituents?
I haven't been able to get through in 3 weeks, Yes. Just another Republican who believes they know better than voters.
I wish he'd schedule a townhall meeting, but he's a coward.
Yep. Him, @tedcruz & @RepKevinBrady. Too afraid to face us, their constituents.
Need to do away with it altogether and just have a National sales tax and a National immigration  tax to pay for the wall.
Wall can be done electronically at tremendous savings . We need $ for other priorities. 20 ft wall? Waste
how about focus on low & middle income folks, reducing their burden of supporting rich? Is that possible, Maj Whip?
how did U like the nut-case of a press conf yesterday? Mental health/hygiene in ACA should B focus 4 GOP health plan.
If ever there was a display why firearms should not be in hands of mentally ill, it was fake press conf by 45 yesterday. 45=loca
Interesting that you think that. Why don't you work w/ your constituents to fight to save public education?
Senate R's are working with the House and SCROTUS to give the 1% tax breaks on the backs of the middle class..#theresistance
Russian operatives were in frequent contact with Trump staffers throughout the campaign. This issue is not going away.
Why are you ignoring us? Town hall in Texas! We want to be heard!
Lack of taxes doesn't create jobs. Reaganomics & trickle-down didn't work the first time! Give cuts to families, not CEOs.
Or the second (GWB) time - in fact, we went into a massive recession!
For some reason, the GOP doesn't see tax cuts as spending our money. It is. Use $ for single payer.
I hope you'll work to close loopholes & make sure companies offshoring their profits pay their fare share for using US resources
As long as the Koch Brothers and the Devos Family and The Mercers get tax breaks all is good .More money for GOP superpacks
translation: "Republicans are about to try to make the billionaires into trillionaires. If you are poor, just go die quietly."
Trickle down doesn't work!
nothing wrong with that...though make sure you can pay for stuff. Common problem w/ GOP, reduce taxes but spending increases.
Can we have the Eisenhower-era rates back? That sustained the greatest economic boom in human history.
what about impeaching Trump after yesterday? Are you kidding me?
