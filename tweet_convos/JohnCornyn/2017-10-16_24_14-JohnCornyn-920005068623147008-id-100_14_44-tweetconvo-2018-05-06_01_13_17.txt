You are a liar. #Resign You are complicit.
U know Corps that cud afford to move operations abroad --did it a long time ago. Tax em 35% on foreign profits, & 0% in USA.
Laughing all the way to the bank eh?
Please be honest. Please!
You’re holding America hostage by not impeaching the Putin installed psycho. Everything you touch will fail until you get rid of him.
Yes, Yes, and Yes.   Senator Cornyn okay with Maddness of Trump, itching for WW3. Military already there, threatening "exercises"
The Senate Budget Committee also crunched some numbers on the Estate Tax you keep refusing to talk about.
The trumPutin just sabotaged 1/6 of the economy and what have you done to protect Constitution from this danger in oval office?
NO Knew Gun Laws!!! NONE!!
Learn English.
and if wishes and buts were candy and nuts we'd all have a Merry Christmas...GOP economic delusions
what a crock! Typical GOP fairy dust economics!  Ask KANSAS how their experiment went!!
Ridiculous assumption akin to smoke & mirrors. More welfare to your rich donors.
Historic and average can't happen at the same time. Now you  sound as lame as Trump
Seriously, what the hell is wrong with you Cornyn? You knew who he was. Anybody with sense knew. Every day a new low
Analysis: Criticized for not commenting on soldiers killed in action, Trump falsely says Obama did even less http://wapo.st/2gJxr97 
Coach Pop knows...let's elect him to your position Cornyn.

If, eh?
I will never forget or forgive how you and @tedcruz have remained silent during this debacle of a presidency. Every day you are silent.
John,would you please stop posting absolute tripe ? A return to the ice age is about as realistic @all100senators
This seems unlikely, so we remain skeptical. Please show us how, exactly, this would happen. Bless your heart.
The trumPutin's tax plan is a boondoggle for the wealthy. AMT, and Inheritance tax = wealthy families avoiding taxes 4 generations to come.
Trickle down economics have not worked in the past. Why do you think it will work now?  Just ask Kansas
That is wishful thinking not sound fiscal policy
And the swamp cabinet
A return to historic presidential norms would decrease national anxiety by 50% and increase international reputation by 75%.
Yup it's as easy as giving the rich more money. It did not work before, but I promise it will really work this time.
With propossed plan --in 10 yrs we'd be at least $10T deeper in debt. Collect 35% on over $30T deferred profits kept offshore
Magical thinking and same old/same old won’t improve growth. 

Your “tax reform” is just a pretext for looting the social safety net.
Trickle down economics didn’t work during the Reagan era or in Kansas.  Stop with these lofty fairytale projections.
Increase of Military spending by Dumbo will wipe that $2 trillion in less than year.  Stop twitting news that will not make a difference.
The town Cryer has spoken.

We would have saved several trillion if Obama hadn't been if office for 8 years.
So why do you want to cut Medicare by $473 billion?
Hey, remember the @BillClinton surplus?
And what was the top tax bracket paying during the growth period you’re referring to?
Do you understand how economies work? You can’t assume we’ll go back to Industrial Revolution era growth, we’re too developed now.
I guess I should thank you for cutting Medicare/gambling with my life,since I have congestive heart failure. Your party likes to gamble with
Americans lives including children.Your projective economic growth is a gamble. A gamble which has lost numerous times when your party sells
BS trickle down economics. Your party is destroying the middle class/American dream. Now the dream is just to access #Healthcare to survive
Hold public hearings & let light of day shine on your assumptions. Townhalls meetings, too.
BTW impeach morons/bigots/frauds, etc.
Stop the double talk just repeal Obama Care and  new lower tax code  without all special interest deductions.  We are sick of your crap
@GOP is born and bred to tell lies!
Remember when @POTUS said he wouldn’t cut Medicare? This week, Senate GOP plans to do just that. 

And how will you return is to historic average growth?  Tax cuts for 1%?  Hahahaha
Massive tax cuts for the wealthy that  increase the deficit by more than a trillion dollars are not tax reform.They are tax cuts for a few.
Senator, Please be honest with . No reputable economists believe massive tax cuts will produce economic growth to offset the tax cuts.
Ok, ok.....now do record growth. Neither are predicted, but how else do you rearrange the deck chairs on the Trumptanic?
Trump will stifle growth when the number of uninsured skyrockets. Don’t kid yourself.
There is no doubt ch thing as trickle down. It’s been a lie for 35 years
Donald Trump exploited the death of soldiers to make a dishonest attack on Obama. I await your condemnation.
Seriously? You just throw numbers out and hope someone is impressed. Count me as not.
That's a lot riding of 'ifs' and still doesn't really address the debt.
repeal obamacare!
And IF I win lotto I will be rich!
Should be a SnapBack in tax legislation so rates go up automatically if deficit does not decline or benefits go disproportionately to rich
Would? You don’t even believe this!
Almost all the tax cuts are for the wealthy and will required cutting Medicare, Medicaid and dramatically increasing the debt.
That's a start. Come on folks, can we make this happen?
You know this is BS.  Trickle down doesn't work!
GOP policies steal from middle class and reward wealthy only. Texas deserves better than Cornyn and GOP policies.
Probably true, but by definition historic growth wouldn’t be predictable let alone manufacturable by government.
Should set goals much higher.  End lobbying and all bribes go towards debt.
Which historic average?  We are a rapidly aging country without immigration so historic growth not possible!
Until McCain and Collins vote against it. They don’t want tax cuts for us only kickbacks for themselves
Whereas most economists say this would NOT be the case. You live in a dreamworld with no concept of reality. #RESIST
At what cost?
This is not how Math or paying off deficients work.
We are not in those times. The world dissnt work that way anymore.
The current DEFICIT is $20trillion or over 61K per citizen not counting unfunded liabilities. We must reform the budget process immediately
and how much would slashing subsidies for ACA increase the deficit by over a 10 year period?
At what price to America and her people?

Do we really think were that stupid!
Perhaps, but you’d be healthier with a 25 year old body. Making that happen is the trick. We can’t reverse manufacturing jobs automated away
You do realize that percentage based analysis is just another way y’all lie?
And a return to my childhood would decrease my stress by 100% but that ain't happening so ..... yeah. #CanCornyn20
How can it be "historic" and "average"??! That would imply "typical", your command of English is historically ridiculous. #GOPMoron
Stop stealing from regular people to give your rich donors more money.
They’re not his donors. They’re his owners.
The problem with that is the Bush tax cuts were going to pay for themselves, they never did.
Your lips are moving so the lies are flowing!
Going to reup this. This isn't just political spin: every single thing GOP says about its tax plan is a flat lie https://nyti.ms/2kQ6GEv 
Please show your work, Senator.
And yet our debt will continue to grow, leaving a mess for our great grandchildren to figure out.  This debt is immoral. Shame on us
Supply-side is a lie.
Meet Mike – a Republican farmer from Kansas who’s speaking out against Trump's tax cuts for the rich.

WATCH: http://facebook.com/taxmarch/videos/352075355231986/ … 
And just think what would happen if you spent less too
So let that happen before you screw up taxes.

The FY18 Budget gives $1.5TRIL in tax cuts to the richest Americans. It cuts about the same from Medicaid & Medicare. Whose side are you on? 

Whoa. Here the WH admits the exec order will  premiums,   taxpayer costs, and screw unsubsidized people with pre-existing conditions. 
Bullshit Congressional projections! Cutting entitlements, privatizing Social Security, downsizing federal government, are all better answers

Here is the Executive Order to undermine the ACA.
