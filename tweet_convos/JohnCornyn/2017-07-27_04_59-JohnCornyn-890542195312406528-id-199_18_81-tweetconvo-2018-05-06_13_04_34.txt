The foundation of Obamacare is a fine by government for not buying federally mandated insurance. Prediction: today we will repeal it & more

#norepeal
Yes and the R's have come up with something so much better?  #freetochoose is an acronym for #oldwhitemenstayrich
The problem here is that you're using facts and logic. Cornyn is a partisan hack and Trump lapdog. All he cares about is getting a "win"
Tried calling, voice mail, work together to fix ACA.
@JohnCornyn so you voted FOR repeal and no replacement. Your constituents vote NO. You work for 45 and your narcissistic ego. Career over.
The basis of #aca  is making sure all Americans have access to coverage. Stop lying about a program that saves lives!
The people here who want to vote the rest of us into slavery to pay for your healthcare are leading America into socialism.
You had better get it done or you guys will find us voting for your opponents!
The FREEDOM OF CHOICE scam has been perpetuated by GOP for privatizing money for education social security and health-care. Its all a CON
Lie. Foundation is to help people get insurance
So you're ok with someone buying a plan that doesn't cover mental health, then developing a mental health condition and not getting care?!
ACA has choices. #freetochoose what, no health care? EVERYONE will need healthcare at some time in their life. #bullshithashtag
We don't want what you're selling. Fix the ACA now!
Your plan still has a mandate!
I. Not paying YOUR f@#king fine.
Free to choose coverage or rent? coverage or food? Definitely free to vote you out #2020iscoming
Apply that logic to my mandated auto insurance.  Apparently Cars are more important than people?
Free to choose a huge tax cut for your rich pals funded on the backs of the sick & poor. Those aren't my Texas values, for damn sure.
Not with John McCain around.  You have to make it affordable for everyone and you must repeal the death tax Obamacare threw in there
IF YOU HAD NOT BEEN HIDING FROM TEXANS, NOT TAKING THEIR COMMENTS YOU COWARD, YOU WOULD HAVE NEVER MADE THAT STUPID PREDICTION.  MAN UP
Lol!!!
#freetochoosenothing
#NoRepeal
If you can't repeal it then Congress needs to mandate it for themselves.
Does this means you'll support keeping @PPact as a choice?
So you're pro-choice now?
Not buying your spin. If I was kidnapped I might be given the choice of be by shot in the head or chest, but neither of those keep me alive.
then you must also remove fines for not paying taxes and not having car insurance and driving  under the influence ...
Thank you for begging Sen McCain to come and vote. You saved healthcare for millions! Also thanks to 46 Dems, 2 Ind, Collins, & Murkowski.
Not voting for you.
#freetochoose between death and bankruptcy
Prediction,  you will still call yourself pro life after you rip life saving care from millons, you hypocritical buffoon
maybe in #fantasyland
#whyiscanadabetter ?
If this bill makes people #freetochose between food and medicine (which it will, you absolute dunderhead) I want nothing to do with it.
I am your constituent and I ask you not to repeal it. Fix it, please. Stop playing partisan games with people's health.
The foundation of the Affordable Care Act is patient protection.
Figure out another way to get everyone insured....oh, I know! Medicare for all!
why not #freetosee or #freetocboscore or #freetobipartsandiscussion or #freetoinvolvepatientgroupsandindustryreview. Just askin.
Fix ACA instead of placing it with a tax cut for the wealthy. Your insurance and benefits are entitlements you don't need!!
Just repeal the crap and worry about replacing later!
No thanks
Oh. My. Gosh. Quit being obtuse! How long has it been since you paid for your family's insurance on an income of $50,000?
Just a guess, you've never been poor?
Doubtful.
So forcing car insurance is ok, but health insurance isn't...
This is not Freedom. That's a dog whistle for your Neanderthal base. Most Texans are against this, as is most of the country.
If the choice is a premium I can't afford,then that's not a choice.Btw your voicemail is full. Constituents should always be able 2 reach u.
The National consensus is we are better off with it and want to keep it unless you give us #medicare4all Will you please stop your attacks?
But we're not #freetochoose to buy auto insurance.  Explain to me the difference, Johnnyboy?
#PreexistingCondition
You,  @tedcruz @GovAbbott are all OUT!!!  No one will believe til it happens but watch more Texans come together to clean HOUSE!!!
Free to choose to never be able to move back to the US - spare a thought for those of us who moved to work for the Army overseas
I corrected your hashtag. #freetofuckoveramerica
Your 28% approval rating is an indication you don't listen. Freedom to choose is simple gaslighting. You're disgraceful. #worstsenatorinusa
to be clear ur plan is #choosetolose #cornygoals
Bullshit! Free to choose to spend money for insurance that you don't have. That's not a choice. GOP Murderers

Hoarding pills, cutting retirement accounts, moving to the Netherlands — how Obamacare enrollees prep for repeal.

That's a lie. http://politi.co/2uyDHrz 
Does free to choose include women's reproductive choices or are we in the same category as folks declared incompetent & had rights revoked?
https://twitter.com/billkristol/status/890581541998387200 …
You can't free market when your options are life or death.
How about #freetochoose on women's reproductive rights? I'm your constituent & OPPOSE #ACA repeal. Your plan is #KochCare
#ACA made sure my prenatal care was covered.
Constituent (78028) - Please vote against repeal and skinny repeal to keep healthcare available to more Texans.
So how does the poor elderly, children, veterans and people on minimum wage "choose"? Where is the Christian compassion? We don't see it.
The foundation for The ACA is Affordable Insurance for all, by having everybody participate. What is the foundation for the repeal?
willing 2 bet ppl w/ cancer never thought they would need coverage until they got sick. Life happens numb-nut. This isn't like buying a car
You will not be getting my vote when up for reelection.  You don't care about Texans and Americans in general when it comes to healthcare!
How does your replacement lower premiums?
Your plan IS NOT A CHOICE.
Did you see the letter from R Senators?
Having no choice is not freedom. You of course know this you just don't care.
Define choice
No one is truly #freetochoose to run from traditional & community obligations to their fellow citizens. @AmSolidarity #prolife4wholelife
Repugnant excuse of senator. Why doesn't @GOP find solutions instead of wasting time/money on this? Reinventing the wheel is stupid, fix ACA
Update your hashtag.  #freetodie
#freetotroll #anybodybutcornyn
War is peace, #Trumpcare is freedom. Cornyn is competent.
Bankruptcy is not "freedom". Death is not "freedom".
That is a hashtag born of ignorance, arrogance, and privilege. Only someone who's never had to choose believes that. #whereisyourhumanity
Texas deserves better than you are capable of giving.
Not if you have a pre-existing condition!!!  #nochoice #SaveACA #SaveMedicaid #SaveOurHealthcare #NoTrumpCare #VoteThemOut #turntexasblue
Not if premiums double and you can't afford medical insurance! Not if your employer no longer provides insurance! #SaveACA #nochoice
Free to lump costs on someone else when you get sick.
Waiting to vote you out of office - listen to your constituents #getofftwitteranddoyourjob
Let's call it what is is: #IveGotMine so you are #FreeToDie from the fake #ProLife party. #deathcare
Exactly.
I heard that 1.7 million Texans would lose their insurance under your plan

My friend's medically fragile will have ZERO plans at a price her parents can afford. You're free market fantasy hates the sick. #deathpanel

LOL.  Conservative Christians are all for something, until hey realize there is money to be made for being against it

#NeverRepeal #ImpeachTrumpNow
Free to choose to die is a pretty terrible campaign slogan. But, you're a terrible senator, so I guess that fits.
So you're pro-choice?  Look forward to hearing your effusive support for @PPGreaterTX
Easy for such decisions when you are not or ever have been without insurance. You are government deciding to make insurance unaffordable
Republicans are shameful and irresponsible. All done in secret. Shame on you!
It is to get everyone in the risk pool, including young and healthy.  To make insurance affordable for all. No fine, just common sense.
If your plan is so great it should be the insurance you and the rest of the GOP use. Good enough for the people good enough for you

I paid it. I will again, due to my circumstances. The good of 325 million people and 25% of the economy is a fair trade.
We can’t choose not to have auto insurance. We can’t choose to avoid  interstates and not pay taxes. Some things society demands.
You still haven't told Texans the estimated loss of coverage in our state per the CBO report. Stop hiding #HealthcareBill #HealthCareForAll
You benefit from government provided, taxpayer funded coverage.
If the GOP fails to pass healthcare reform they will lose the Senate. I am one of those who was fined by the IRS under Obamacare. Enough!
What dries that even mean?
DO NOT TAKE AWAY MY FAMILY'S HEALTH INSURANCE.
If I am priced out of the market what choices do I have...there is no freedom to choose.... U Lie to pad your own pockets...Shame on U
More lies told by John, adopting the behavior from the top. The Skinny Bill - Premiums up by 20% and Uninsured  goes up by 16 million
Insurance for all!!! You don't get it.
When the majority of your constituents want to #saveACA + fix it yet you vote against them- that's not representative governing- #democracy
I'll support you when you introduce a bill to cut ins. and retirement benefits to Congress.
Surprise @JohnCornyn fed gov (tax payers) foots the bill for the uninsured- less costly to tax payers if we all have coverage ignoramus
Whats ? up with the repub transgender problem.Is it another form of racism you repubs think it's legal ! Equal rights is Equal rights, SIR
Parr of being a decent human being and a member of society means reducing your level of pain in the assedness: shit, shower, shave, insure.
Live under the laws you foist upon us, that's servant leadership
This happened this week in the Appalachian's Senator...here...in America! Is this what you mean by #FreeToChoose??
We need to fix ACA so it's affordable for all in every state. We need to regulate big Pharma & Insurance companies to keep costs down.
Or free to not buy auto insurance and pay a fine
Just like you are free to not pay your taxes and pay a fine.
You are absolutely free to either purchase health insurance with government help or pay a fine.
Please repeal the President
#RentOrHealthcare is #NotFreedom
#RepairNotReplace

Loss of insurance companies due to #45 & cronies destabilizing it.  Stop it.  Work for us not against us
You get govt healthcare fully paid for by us. Why do we not deserve the same?
You will allow people to pay for a policy that covers NOTHING. Same on you.
That's how insurance works. You need to buy in before you get sick. You can't buy life insurance after you're dead either.
You're not #freetochoose if you can't afford insurance. We're mandated to buy car, housing and renters insurance. Why is this different?
Already free choice about paying fine/tax or getting insurance.  Lots of choices lead to taxes.
"We broke 7 years of promises, but may be able to squeeze a bill renaming Obamacare through with 50 votes."
Get insurance companies out of the doctors office.  Now, insurance makes medical decisions. Docs process insurance payments. #assbackwards
Free to choose if you can afford it. Free to die if not.
When the time comes, I will choose to vote you out of office, and that's the nicest thing I can say right now.
Free to choose from crap options! Stellar Johnny!
Insurance 101 - spread of risk - you don't need  it until you need it.  Many ER's don't deny for lack of insurance so we pay 1 way or other.
The foundation of ACA is a single risk pool, like the other civilized countries utilize. Repeal will take America backwards & kill people.
