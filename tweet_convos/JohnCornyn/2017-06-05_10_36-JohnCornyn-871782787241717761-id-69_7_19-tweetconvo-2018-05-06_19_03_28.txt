Watch out for rising sea levels in 100 years kids! You know why!
Part of my plan is to have a functioning FEMA + NOAA. Perhaps you could get @POTUS to fill those posts. #ashamedofmysenator
Wonder if not having a FEMA head  will hurt our coastal regions? Maybe pulling out of Paris accords wasn't the best "action" 
Tell that to trump who has yet to make appointees!
Too bad no one is in charge of NOAA or FEMA.
I went to reply but hundreds of your constituents beat me to it.
You & @sendavidperdue should be embarrassed to mention this.
& has ur president #TrumPutin appointed a head of #FEMA yet? Hmmmm...
no FEMA head, 120 days in. #MAGA
When are you holding your town hall? You can explain what the GOP is doing about lack of FEMA and NOAA heads.
What about you taking action to get qualified people to head FEMA & NOAA???
Would love to see tweets from you regarding a new healthcare bill & tax reform!! Republican @POTUS Republican Congress.
When you say "take action", do you mean "demand we stay in the Paris Accord" so our climate-related disasters don't get worse?
Can we call you if something happens since there's no one at the helm at FEMA?
I'm taking action by supporting @RepBetoORourke to replace one of my Senators, and @JoaquinCastrotx to replace the other.
The Hurricane is Trump and his inability to handle his role as our leader.
Does the GOP #HaveAPlan to make this administration competent? NOAA and FEMA could help minimize impact of storms if they were well led.
Hurricanes are not real. They are just a way for #bigweather to make money.
Hurricanes are fake news. Don't you know?
You should probably have a #FEMA director and not gut funding from #NOAA. That's a good plan to start with. Signed south Florida resident
How about the president staffing FEMA. Isn't that a good plan!!
Hope by the time the first hurricane hits the U.S. FEMA has a leader. Trump has yet to nominate anyone to the post.
@JohnCornyn Would be nice if had people in FEMA & NOAA. Although if @POTUS filled them, they'd be w/unqualified billionaires
@JohnCornyn Has Trump nominated a FEMA administrator? I thought not.
Yes it is and you and your miserable party don't have a head at FEMA.  Way to look out for your constituents. #fail
How about getting a FMA director?
Hey John maybe YOU can start by getting a leader for FEMA & NOAA since we have no one. The republicans and YOU are pathetic. Careers over.
Do we have a new FEMA director?
Why bother God will it( or so you all say about everything else)
And our FEMA director is......?
A plan starts with funding NOAA and NWS etc. "I'll just pray the hurricane away," said no forecaster ever.
And with climate change, that action would be kiss your ass goodbye
Take action!  Yes, take action on climate change so hurricane season won't be year round.
One week in and no hurricanes. Winning! Hopefully it stays that way.
What's the name of the head of FEMA should we need to call? Or at NOAA?  IDIOTS
And our FEMA administrator is who?
Get our puppet president to appoint director of FEMA, please.
Good idea. How about a director of FEMA and NOAA? That would be a good start to preparedness
How about you guys get someone decent to head up FEMA and NOAA? That'd be a huge step.
Do we have a leader for FEMA? Do you have a plan Johnny? Does this administration?
GA voters would appreciate it if you tried to do something to get the gov functioning. Appt FEMA or #impeach the problem in the WH.
Trump / Republicans ARE TAKING ACTION with budget cuts to the COAST GUARD. As always, U.S. is doomed under @GOP leadership. #GOPScam
Tell your POTUS that we need a FEMA director. He needs to stop making excuses
Meet with your constituents!
Think @realDonaldTrump would listen?
Derby season is over. Brownie is available for FEMA. TELL TRUMP. HAHAHA
People face a greater risk from @realDonaldTrump and his anti-American policies which YOU support. You're the ones who need to evacuate.
Part of the plan was the #ParisAccord.  What now @SenatorIsakson?  #HaveAPlan?
Would be nice if that moron in WH would actually nominate someone for FEMA & NOAA so wouldn't it?!
Do you think if the president will appoint a FEMA director that might be a good plan?
#HaveAPlan Impeach #trumpet and elect new people to Congress that actually care about the future and people.
@JohnCornyn I plan on staying at your place in DC, John. I learned planning from Replutocrats. Anything to get more $$$$.
As my senator, I would hope you would tell @realDonaldTrump to appoint heads of FEMA and NOAA.
You mean Hurricane Donald? I have already taken cover and suggest you do the same.#resist#trumprussia#theresistance
Who's the director of @FEMA now? Oh, we don't have one? 
I keep forgetting Trump only has so many hours in the day to Tweet / Golf / Nap !
You forgot watch Fox News and call its anchors for policy advice.

To all coastal friends & foes, make sure your hurricane kit is ready. 
#HaveAPlan how about the #ParisAgreement so NFIP doesn't go belly-up & so banks will continue to give out 30-yr mortgages on coastlines!?
How about you take action to help get us a FEMA director. Heck of a job, Brownie'
How about YOU take the action and make sure there's a @fema director in place #DoYourJob
The president should probably name someone to the FEMA position then, huh?
How about getting your President to appoint a director for the agencies that will look out for us...or are you just gonna tweet?
We did. It was called the Paris Agreement!
