You shouldn't live here. You don't represent us.
God forbid, you want more progressive, compassionate cities in TX? They are opposite of what you and @GovAbbott are for.
Seriously. Last time I checked, @JohnCornyn wasn't very liberal at all. It seems he actually dislikes most human beings - at least 22mil.
He loves the 15M out of that 22 that are glad that we will no longer be forced to buy a product/service we don't want. #PAYFORYOUROWN
The new plan still penalizes people for not having insurance and cost even more to get back on it - if that's what you're referring to.
Doesn't alter the stats that say they will be uninsured by choice, not due to being dropped or disallowed.
ACA is failing and the AHCA is worse. Congress needs to sit down & create a real plan that works. It takes more than 13 ppl 3 months to fix
Exactly. They don't have a health care plan for all Americans....this bs is population control.
Join the Army. VA will provide all the free healthcare you want.
First we have to stop Gov. Abbot from effing Austin up with his crazy anti-tree regulations.
of course you try to capitalize on our LIBERAL cities progressiveness.. WHY WON'T YOU ANSWER to your constituents calls/letters?
You claiming Austin's victory while slamming them as sanctuary city?  Do you even know what the word hypocrite means?  @senategop lose #2018
Austin is the worst example of the great state of Texas. .....full of liberal left wing nuts.  But it fits John (Wayne) Cornyn's style.
Do you have any idea how unpopular you are in Austin, Senator?  Oh, and this article says DONT withdraw from trade agreements.
Hilarious you would tweet this out. You couldn't get elected to a sanitation commish in Austin with your views and voting record! 
Are you're not like our Gov who thinks Austin stinks? ATX does not like you.
And, Austin is as blue as blue can be surrounded by a sea of red districts...
It's a great place for a #TownHall! Your Austin area constituents would love to see you.
So would Houston consituents...not your wealthy donors but your average constituents.   But...we don't count to you...that is very apparent
It's called "doing everything the Texas government doesn't do."

e.g. accept diversity, shell out for schools, parks, roads, etc
Why would we want to do that?
So you want more liberal cities?
Yes! It's an intro course into how to get rid of Republicans!
yes don't vote republican
Have you been to Austin? This century? I'll take 1975 version.
Meanwhile #TrumpCareKills Austin and Dallas are BLUE and you are ignoring all of us here in Texas.
A traffic choked, overpriced city with gerrymandered Congressional districts so as not to represent residents?  Pass. I'd prefer San Antonio
Apparently the key to success may be electing Democrats since that's the predominant local party.
Austin is great in spite of your GOP political stronghold on the state. You don't get credit for Austin's greatness
Vote Democratic. Support immigrants. Reject most of the policies of the governor.
#Austin is a great city and the best part is you never have to see @JohnCornyn or @SenTedCruz.They never show their faces. They are afraid
Town hall?   Are you in competition with the ass-in-chief to see who can tweet more in one day?
Another city crying for Federal funds for city and state highways...yet GOP says it's for smaller federal,government...which is it Senator?
As the MOST gerrymandered city in the country, 4 out of 5 districts are #GOP controlled in this liberal city. Is that what your hoping for?
Austin, the most liberal city in TX!

Why would they want to?  Filled with liberal freaks!
Why would anyone want to be like Austin?
8 of the last 12 years - when all those jobs were added - were under President Obama's leadership. Really makes you think, Senator Forehead!
From the GOP IT'S always the "sky is falling" especially as they continune to Sabatoge Obama care.
No body in Texas wants another Liberal Austin Texas.
Invest in research, technology and innovation and Education is how its done.  But LA is growing faster.
& populate w/progressive people. In spite of redistricting, Austin is forward thinking. That's what's attracting people. The spirit of hope.
Will you suggest @GregAbbott_TX mind his business?
Vote Democratic?
You like liberal Austin? Texas deserves better than Cornyn and Cruz.
LOL, Austin is as liberal as they come.
No thank you
You mean a city that the governor wants to defund and assert over-reaching control of while you applaud him?
Why would anybody want that? Let them keep their weird.
Alright!
Why would anyone want their City to be like Austin Texas. It's a great place to visit but we sure the hell wouldn't want to live there
once again, top notch trolling sir
I don't think he is trolling.
Austin and all of Texas will fail economically if our health care system fails #nobcrap #dontmesswithtexashealthcare
Arguably one of the most liberal and predominately Democratic areas of the state. I thought that stuff was bad for business.
You'll shit talk Austin for being too liberal, and in the same breath try to take credit for the money it brings in.
Huh you are talking about one and the only liberal city in while TX as a model? Are you that old?
Try emulating liberal minded, young, willing to be educated, forward thinking, people. Yes! That's the answer. Austin is not GOP inclined!
Wait, isn't Austin a Sanctuary City? Why wasn't that mentioned?
Don't talk about Austin if you won't even meet with your constituents here. ATX voted 66% for Clinton. We don't want trump or you. #resist
C'mon, you Republicans HATE Austin, as Abbot has shown this year.
A city filled with Democratic Party-voting hippies? Just keep doing what you're doing, boy; the whole nation will be voting D in no time.
Awesome city which means most people there probably hate you.
Go blue?
Austin hates you
Sell to Amazon?
By Voting Democrat!
Haha.Austin is the most liberal city in the entire state and probably most of the country. Sanctuary city, Austin, Texas. I live here.
Step 1: have representatives who are actively hostile to your city and refuse to meet with residents who then take credit for city's success
Please, God, no.
Get rid of Republicans and live your life the way you want without Government in your business all the time. Like love who you want.
That silly blueberry in the tomato soup. How many precincts do you suppose you will win? So yeah, I hope all of Texas becomes like Austin.
You know #txlege is not in session when Tx Republicans are singing praises to Austin.
Increase in gov't investment while cutting taxes & reducing deficits is a pipe dream that R's have selling for years. Not a real policy.
#5  "Thou shalt not kill" Even this is in your version of the Christian Bible.
Please turn ALL Texas cities/towns BLUE!
And they vote democratic!
You are trying to ruin austin. Stop using it to feel cool.
1) They never let go of their public utility for electricity. Centerpoint keeps charging me more for privilege of damaging my electronics.
Great place to hold a TOWN HALL. Let's have conversation about things you so proudly tweet about.
Austin is a success due to educated liberal values and love for the arts which sets it apart from the rest of Backward TX
Don't need overpriced irrational foods, just #lowcarb , #LCHF , #NSNG . Lots of green vegetables, dairy fats, oil fish, some meat & fowl.
Learn to love olive oil and animal fat!
Everything you post makes me cringe.
Have horrible infrastructure, horrible mass transit, and housing/rental costs completely out of control, you mean?
Hey John, here's how you can help your constituents. Vote no on #Deathcare
Tell that to our Governor when you get a chance.
Whoa, way to go Senator... oh, it's a love letter to tax cuts for corporations, never mind. Got my hopes up for a sec.

1/ I haven’t tweeted much about healthcare because it’s a painful subject for me. But it’s important, so let me tell you my story 
Why do you support kicking 22 million Americans off their health insurance to fund a $569 billion giveaway to the ultra rich?
I'm not fond of Sanctuary Cities!
Our city experiences terrific growth because of its openness... which is another way of saying... creativity.

Your boss missed this: "withdrawing from or changing int'l trade agreements carries enormous risk of boycotts & market-share loss to China."
Interesting that you are pointing to the liberal city resisting Republicon fucknuttery. #ImpeachTrump #Trumpcare #TrumpcaresUnAmerican
