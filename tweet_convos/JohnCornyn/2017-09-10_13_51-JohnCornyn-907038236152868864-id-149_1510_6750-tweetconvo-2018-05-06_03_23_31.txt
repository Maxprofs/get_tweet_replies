Great job Governor Scott. Proud to be a Floridian.
Remember that when this crisis is over, fight for ALL Floridian - not just those who support your campaign coffers. #RESIST
We still have little power, few street lights, no internet, and no gas available at many stations.  Are you even in Florida?
Thanks to all who've helped. We feel the love.
Let God deal with all this
Everyone except @AnnCoulter.  Mr. Scott did you know she thinks we are having a typical rainstorm.  Laughed in the faces of Floridians. #SAD
Ann Coulter - another climate change denier.
Governor Scott you've done an admirable job
Climate change is serious, but we appreciate the support.

#IrmaHurricane
Thank you for you and your teams efforts to keep us safe...spending time in my closet with kitty during Central Florida Tornado warnings!
As a retired Florida Employee, I'm extremely proud of our Executive Officers in their handling of this emergency!  You Rock Scott!!
Rick Scott has shown why the people of Fla elected him!! I voted for him during his 1st term. Always ready to serve his fellow Floridians 
Unfortunately most people are more concerned about football and the Miss America pageant than people dying.

Now let's talk about Climate Change and how we can work with the rest of the world to fight it.
It'd be great if you accepted climate change. Bit since not, every person that dies tonight and in the days coming are on your hands.
shut up Voldemort
Governor Scott you have set the bar very high for how to oversee a natural disaster.
Thank you Gov Scott. Great leadership during this difficult time.
Great passion for your people in need! Hunkered down in Sun City Center. God bless!
Gov. Scott..you are an example of great leadership along with the talent to multi-task. Thank you
From CT where we've seen devastating storms - you have done an outstanding job leading the great people of Florida through a rough time!
Amen, praying for zero mortality. Even Jesus said, "Run4theHills!" Luke 21: 22-25
Incredibly impressed by your leadership!  Thankful you're leading the way as my family lives in Florida!  God bless you!

I am so grateful to how you have handled this whole storm Gov Scott! Truly a great job.

I don't particularly like you but I will commend you on the work you did to help Florida get through Irma.  Thank you.
I don't know this Gov well from political perspective (CT) but agree, hard to ignore his leadership thru this. Tough love and compassion.
Gov Scott, our schools & school personnel are proving to be essential to the infrastructure of our are communities. #hcpsproud
You are doing a remarkable job! Thank you for tirelessly covering the state as we prep for Irma's arrival and departure. A+ Sir!
All states matter.

Thanks Governor Scott for your awesome leadership during these stressful times.
How?
After the hurricane passes through, will you be talking about #climatechange or are you still in donor induced denial?
