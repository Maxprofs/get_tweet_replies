"Protect our republic"= Kushner's security clearance must be revoked. Now.
You mean protecting us from Russian hackers right? Do you mind letting @realDonaldTrump know?
"Election Integrity"  ????  Why do you continue voter suppression efforts while scamming election integrity?  Phony and liar...
I certainly wish they wouldn't turn my voting data over to the Kobach team.
Oh, and look. Kobach published personal information of critics of the program to http://whitehouse.gov .
https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/docs/comments-received-june-29-through-july-11-2017.pdf …
Just shameful that they did that!
Did disvussion include GOP gerrymandering & court case?  If not, more maj whip nonsense.
The only election integrity problem we have is called RUSSIA. What are you going to do about that, John?
Only this corrupt admin would be so blatant as to publish people's private info. Give them nothing @rolandopablos
White House released 112 pages of voter comments to Kobach & Trump's Election Integrity Commission—they're amazing. https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/docs/comments-received-june-29-through-july-11-2017.pdf … 
What integrity? Gerrymandering, disenfranchisement, giving our data to the feds on demand?
Keep our info private. End gerrymandering. Stop voter suppression. Do your job.
What are you doing to protect our personal information from being released as part of the request of the Pence-Kobach commission?
Did you talk about how gerrymandering disenfranchises voters and the voter ID law suppresses the vote?
Did you talk about the personal information that has already been released online? Y'all should talk about that.
"Texas racist voter suppression systems". There...fixed that for ya. You're  welcome.
Good thing we don't have taxation without representation. Oh wait...
-an party.......It looks like your tweet got cut off. "Protecting our republican party" is surely what you meant. You cannot be trusted.

Quit wasting money!!
How about Russia doing the same
So more gerrymandering? Voter suppression? Maybe you shouldn't use big words like integrity. I'm not convinced you understand its meaning.
Yes, you are doing a great job, not #FullRepeal of Obamacare 
Obstructionist GOP senate needs 2 come clean - country before party - and condemn 45 & campaign.
Do not hand over our data. This is so un-Texan.
The GOP should partner with Good Ol' Putin (GOP)! It will be a fantastic cyber security program.
Was Texas hacked by Russia like other states? It is oils be good to know.....and stop it!

Protecting the republic should start w/enforcing  sanctions & revoking Jared's clearance..Your complicit nature is far from patriotic.
Cornyn ...you are exceptionally corrupt
You have achieved the impossible. You somehow make Kay bailey Hutchinson look decent, and we all remember she wasn't.
How about protecting our nation by getting rid of the idiot who lied his way into the presidency?
How is our Christian integrity going? Are we rating high on the compassion scale?
The best way to protect our republic would be to impeach trump.
I must wonder: WHY all these tweets, John? Your partisan blinders prevent you from protecting anyone.
So you guys were talking about the effectiveness of gerrymandering
Any discussion of Russia or gerrymandering?  Those are the biggest threats to integrity.
How about a YES VOTE from you to build the wall. I can't see where YOU are protecting ANY citizens
You mean suppressing minority votes and gerrymandering
Stop the gerrymandering
Get rid of the Russians!
Any democratically controlled county in Texas needs to be investigated for voter fraud since the days of Lyndon Johnson
have to keep the "integrity" of our gerrymandering and voter suppression in place.  And blow out of proportion any "illegal" voting we find.
you joining @GregAbbott_TX  and @DanPatrick  in bringing Jim Crowe back to TX?  Texas GOP is in a race to the bottom...
How many ex-KGB were there? #Transparency
Are you discussing how to kill any remaining privacy we have? Gerrymandering? We are so tired of your circus act. #GetRealorGetOut
Paper ballots...
And how your party can best destroy that through gerrymandering and voter suppression?
How many Democrats did you have in the room? Just asking for the sake of a bi-partisan decision made regarding ALL voters in TX.
You obviously can't protect our election integrity because we have god damn traitors in the White House right now.
I want paper ballots and I want a receipt to track my vote. I don't trust a single one of you to protect my vote.
Parts of 14 states use voting machines with no paper trail. Includes major cities like Atlanta, Philly & Houston 
1. This admin is full of blatant liars & pu$$y grabbers. 2. The Pres obviously cognitively impaired. 3. You are all complete hypocrites
I will be interested in hearing about what this department will be doing to stop the ongoing  disenfranching of minority voters
What did they say about mail in ballots?


The word Integrity And Texas Election don't belong in the same sentence nor do you have any integrity #cowardcornyn
Can you protect our republic by defending net neutrality and fixing Obamacare, rather than repealing it?
Wow,... now only if you would have done this a year earlier. Like before an outside group meddled in our election.
Oh John....we know you're a traitor. Let's not pretend otherwise. #TrumpRussia is going to suck you down with it. Complicit, you are.
You misspelled Voter Supression and Gerrymandering Senator.
I sure hope so since Texas was one of the state's hit in the Russian hacks!!!!
Do you only pose for photo ops or do you actually #DoYourJob ? #hypocrite #TrumpRussia #LockHimUp #LockThemAllUp #Resist
"...current company excluded of course"
"Ok guys..how do we make it illegal for minorities to vote"?

Opinion: The GOP’s moral rot is the problem, not Donald Trump Jr. http://wapo.st/2usfyo4 
Protect us from this Russian-installed administration. Time to rethink the GOP Russian apologist strategy.  Be a Patriot/protect Texans
Do all counties in TX have backup paper ballot records available if needed to verify electronic totals and protect against hackers?
hahha-you DO realize this pic shows men who look as it they are as "techie" as my cat. Pray they have some hi-tech gurus working the systems
Great. I am glad that you are on top of this issue, because when @BetoORourke beats @SenTedCruz next year I want it to be fair and square.
Does this mean you're standing firm against giving away voter information?
Hopefully you're protecting our system from members of your own party.
You mean theft. Not election integrity.
Bullshit you people were going to gift the citizens voter info away if you already haven't the state of Texas citizens need to clean house
And yet you remain silent concerning the House of Trump.  Silence is an answer too!  Sometimes speaking louder than words John...
Did you mention how the administration leaked 400,000 Americans personal information today, of course not you POS
I'll bet everything I have in the bank. They only released the ones that differ from the voting commission
DO NOT RELEASE VOTER DATA TO THE #FAKEVOTERCOMMISSON
If you want to protect the Republic stop supporting the foreign operative currently residing in the White House.
You don't seem to even know the meaning of the word integrity anymore
