Snow falls in the Sahara desert for the first time in 37 years http://buff.ly/2hsLu1d  
Okay @JohnCornyn, I'll bite.
1/ Did you know that the world's largest desert is... in Antarctica? http://geology.com/records/largest-desert.shtml …
2/ Deserts are defined by precipitation, not merely by temperature. We learned this in the 5th grade (maybe TX is different)
3/ You'll also notice that the article notes that this was the first Saharan snow in Algeria in 37 years...
4/ ... so what happened is uncommon, but not unprecedented. Stats is hard, but this is basic logic.
5/ For instance, it's raining right now in Fullerton, CA. It's rained a bit more lately than they've been accustomed to...
6/ ... but December is the rainy season here, so if it was going to rain this much during the year the time is now.
7/ Moving on, what do we need to make snow? Atmospheric humidity, and freezing temperatures at altitude.
God, you are a stupid individual. WTF.
Wake up, Cornyn! There are Texans, Americans out here who know how crazy your perspective is. #climatechange is REAL! (more)
More arctic and antarctic ice than there has been for years. Gore said it'd be gone by 2015. It's a sham.
You too are misinformed. #blessyourstupidhearts
they're not misinformed, they're simply ignoring facts that don't agree with their politics
Liberals do tend to block people with different info. Like Ms Buckley did by blocking. Too funny!
So, your argument is a first grade "I know that you are, but what am I"?
nope. Just an observation of fact.

you win.
The greatest threat to our Republic isn't ISIS -- it's idiots, and you are Exhibit A.


sometimes I can't tell who is the bigger idiot between you and @tedcruz. It's Cruz but this tweet doesn't help.
Joshua Becker Hey Congrats your selected Go to our site in description
The limits of your knowledge would be funny if they didn't threaten the world. Stick to being pig and let the Scientists talk.
wow. you are ignorant. too bad future generations will pay the price.
...pay for what? Do you really believe man can influence naturally cyclical global climate chg?
It's not a hoax. Please educate yourself. http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/ 
again...all naturally cyclical. That crap is brought to you by the group that benefits from climate tax.
NASA is wrong, science is wrong... you must be right. but even if that's true.... https://www.facebook.com/notes/arnold-schwarzenegger/i-dont-give-a-if-we-agree-about-climate-change/10153855713574658/ …

I believe the scientific community, you believe a cheesy website that looks like it was made in 1998.

Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) has received the most money from the oil& gas & coal mining industries, over $1.6 million since 2010.
it's not suppose to snow in the desert. That's why they call it climate change.
Ignorant much?
Are you really this ignorant, or do you just pretend to appease your base?
do you REALLY believe climate change is man made & not naturally cyclical as proven by REAL science?  @JohnCornyn is correct.
So you studied climate science too?
Just saw this tweet.  Un-fuckin-believable.  It seems as though even the denial is bigger in Texas.
@theblaze Please keep showing off that quality TX education. How about leave science to scientist and try educating yourself? 
(R)s certainly believe in when it makes them $ or they need protection for their interests:
@theblaze 
Because of idiots like you, Senator, scientists call this climate change.  Cannot believe we still pay you a salary!
Maybe brand new glaciers will form in the Sahara to replace all the melting ones all over the planet... Get a grip!
@theblaze exactly the point dude. #embarrassed you're my U.S. rep in #congress
Just because you're from Texas doesn't mean you have to be so ignorant. No credibility or respect.I love Texas but people like U
There should be an IQ test to hold office. FFS...
I do not know if you are just this ignorant or paid off by the energy industry. Probably both.
@theblaze you are an ignoramus & should not be in the Senate or where you can spread stupidity.
.  You're  not only stupid of the facts,  your mean spotted.
We're planning a big Xmas Eve dinner. Nice to know that proves world hunger doesn't exist anymore.
I don't think so.
You realize we call it "climate change" for a reason, right?
it's nice to know that the list of qualifications to be a politician in Texas includes a requirement for breathtaking ignorance.
Have you gotten enough yet? Global warming, LOL.
TSTL
Inhofe brings in a snowball to indicate no global warming. That was stupid. This is even dumber. You ought to resign in shame.
how stupid one have to be to get to your position? WTF??
Jack Ass.  Clearly there is no minimum IQ requirement for the US Senate.
Please look up climate and weather.  They are related, they are not the same thing.
@theblaze I have serious doubts about your ability to think in a rational manner.
It's hilarious that you think you're either clever or smart.
It's you who isn't a scientist vs all the scientists. 
Hmm, who to believe?

what a dunb fuck,
Watch "Day after tomorrow" on Starz

Can you really be that dumb?
@theblaze are u really that stupid?
Climate is not weather. Since you are too dumb to understand this, please consult an elementary school science teacher for help
How do you sleep at night leaving a destroyed earth to your grandchildren? You have no soul.
you should bring a snowball to Congress.......
The sad part is your actually a Senator. You're supposed to be educated & informed. #Ignorant #Science
I wanted to say something funny, but the ignorance on display here is just too depressing.
You are one brain dead individual:
Please go talk to a real scientist.
@theblaze Yes, genius. Global warming. You guys just don't get it!
https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-content/sotc/global/2016/nov/ytd-horserace-201611.png …
@theblaze weather != climate, but except for that... well, your post still makes no sense.
https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/climate-trends-continue-to-break-records …
@theblaze Stop embarrassing yourself. And The Blaze is not a source.
@theblaze Senator, you mistake weather for climate.  For our children's sake, please look at the science.
@theblaze  its called "climate"...wait for it..."change" get it now!
@theblaze how ignorant are you?
Yr jury is still out? Yes, TEXTBOOK evidence! Global warming means strange things happen & Nature is out of whack @CharlesMBlow
It's like a speed bag. Faster you go, the more it gyrates. More energy into atmosphere  allows air masses to move in new ways.
Yes, higher average temps mean more energy in atmosphere, greater highs and lows, more variance in weather.
@theblaze Precisely! Climate change! Get it? OMG and you are a freaking senator!
It’s tragic that you can’t get past your prejudices and be objective about the facts.
@theblaze 

Climate change?
.@JohnCornyn Re bio: We ARE NOT honored u rep our great state of TX. Re Twt: Did u even graduate hs? Jesus man, educate yourself PLEASE!
Everything's big in Texas!  Even DAs 
"Other likely changes include more frequent extreme weather events including...snowfall."
What color lipstick does Rex Tillerson make you wear?
Please stop embarrassing Texas...There IS climate change...there IS global warming. It is time to do something about it!
Try and keep up, Senator. They're calling it "global climate change" now. More accurate. Ask anyone who is already feeling it
are you serious?! Do you have a brain between your ears, or is that space up for rent?!
the concept is obviously too deep for you to grasp. We'll handle it over at the big boys and girls table, go have an ice cream
North Pole is above freezing today, 50 degrees above normal. If that doesn't worry you, Senator, you are on thin ice.
.@JohnCornyn per your ignorance on the Sahara snowfall, that is called localized weather Mr Senator, any elementary student knows that.
.@JohnCornyn Do you even science, bro?
Climate change is causing all kinds of extreme weather.
today was colder than yesterday... climate change solved i guess  wohoo #areyouanidiot
Climate. Change.

Educate yourself, you superstitious dickstain.
1. It's called "climate change".
2. The result is EXTREME weather. That's what this *IS*.
3. Go talk to a climatologist or two.
Ignorant and you should be ashamed on behalf of your kids, grandkids, your constituents, and every teacher you've ever had
@tallywineguy @theblaze No. it happened 37 years ago. Was it global warming then?
And, the weather in Texas over the last decade???
You're an idiot. read up on some science, you ignorant fool.
Hey… Senator @JohnCornyn.
How about that, Moron.

Arctic (heard of it?) 40-50F warmer.
Deserts colder. 

Anyone?
Bad. News. The Arctic is 40-50 degrees F warmer than usual right now. It's melting in December. http://bit.ly/2i5zhQX  
@theblaze It's winter.
yes! https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2016/12/20/forecast-north-pole-to-warm-50-degrees-above-normal-thursday-near-melting-point/?utm_term=.6bb875dcaa44 …
Do your research!!
@theblaze climate vs weather. Are really that stupid
Saw great documentary about how poles are warming, which moves the polar air away from them.Hence the cold air in other places
@theblaze do the world a favor and educate yourself on the topic before tweeting! http://www.businessinsider.com/leonardo-dicaprio-documentary-before-flood-watch-2016-11 …
@theblaze You don't read much, do you?
Global warming disturbs normal weather patterns resulting in extremes such as snow in Sahara.  Overall earth continues to warm.
How much more ignorant can you be...do u really believe this or r u just appealing to your u educated base?
@theblaze Ignorance celebrated in USA vs science and education = why we lag behind world. Sad.
@theblaze don't be stupid. Listen to the scientists. Any idiot can see that it's a problem.
@theblaze Climate change would be the reason that happened.
Read a fucking book
I forgot. You folks BANNED science in Texas, didn't you? Still, embarrassing to publicly flout your ignorance.
.@JohnCornyn you need to learn the difference between weather and climate.
Do you not understand the word GLOBAL. Isolated strange weather incidents like this actually bey GLOBAL warming.
When we are paying trillions later this century to relocate our coastal cities, people will not remember you fondly....
Increasing weather oscillations are a BASIC prediction of global warming science, you shameful ignoramus.
.@JohnCornyn Senator, please ask a 12-yr old to teach you 7th grade science. Be as ignorant as you'd like. Please stop being proud of it.
Do you believe in ANY science?Why accept science when it comes to medicine, technology, engineering, space etc. but not climate?
Repeat after me Corny...climate change...no question mark.
Did you even read why it happened or even review the science? Of course not. You're too beholding to the fossil fuel industry
The word 'stupid' really doesn't do you justice. You're way past that point.
You are aware that TheBlaze is not and has never been a scientific publication. Please avail yourself of NOAA/NASA expertise.
Senator-Booger-eatin-moron from my home stae of Texas.  way to represent...the fossil fuel industry!
Science illiterate @JohnCornyn cites media founded by Glenn Beck excuse me I can't stop laughing
Global warming? https://twitter.com/theblaze/status/811689931311644672 …
Science illiteracy is probably the tip O' the old melting iceberg when it comes to Cornyn's ignorance.
@theblaze https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2016/12/20/forecast-north-pole-to-warm-50-degrees-above-normal-thursday-near-melting-point/?hpid=hp_hp-more-top-stories_cwg-northpole-350pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.7d7ba8b1cf63 …
Do educated people still make this ignorant argument?What about all the days Saddam&bin Laden&Hitler DIDN'T have people killed?
Fool.
You sit on a throne of lies
Climate change is more complex than local snowfalls. Today's desert snow doesn't equal the melting polar ice. #smh
Can old John really be this out of touch with reality?  Yes, yes he can.
Were you in AZ this July when the temperature was 126? For several Days? Been here over 30 yrs and it hasn't been this hot.

You don't "science" much, do you?

 @theblaze
Yes Idiot!Global warming! Glad this sellout can atleast spell it!
omg! You're own city experiences negative global warming effects.Please visit Rice the next time you are in town. they'll tell u
@theblaze climate denial is geezer trolling and its the saddest fucking thing in the world to witness
@theblaze let me understand your intelligence snow in the desert & your conclusion NO global warming you have my vote for moron!
@theblaze climate change! Learn your terms senator!
It must be so nice to have this level of ignorance. Personally, I worry a lot about my kids witnessing the end of humanity.
Are you really that stupid? Or just pretending?
@theblaze Do you have children? grandchildren? Your profound ignorance dooms them. I sincerely hope you can come to see clearly
@theblaze yes. #science
It's called Climate Change. Maybe you should read up on it.
@theblaze Me thinks you know the difference between climate and weather but you're just exploiting the gullibility of your base
My 6th graders know better...
Brain capable of nuanced thought?
@theblaze brain?
nobody is actually this stupid in 2016.
Unbelievable, did you go school? You should just retire...
Please talk to someone knowledgeable about climate change before making any more irresponsible comments.  Al Gore, perhaps
This tweet makes you look horribly ignorant.
there's a difference between weather and climate, sir.
@theblaze Stop holding back humanity with your idiocy. Step down immediately. People are dying because of myopic fools like you.
Umm...
It's frightening to see how conservatives wear ignorance as a badge of honor.
@theblaze hey John, I just had a big breakfast. Did I solve world hunger?
@theblaze kind of the point, genius.  Reading a freaking book!
you do know you won't fall off the edge of the world if you keep sailing towards the horizon, don't you? #Texas #education

Yes
It's revealing that you make lame jokes about a serious national security issue.
Go to Texas A&M and ask them about carbon emissions you blockheaded doughnutfucker
@theblaze Take a science class. So embarrassed u r my Senator.
Sheesh, you are a terrible senator. #TexasEducationNeedsWork
yes, global warming.  https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/north-pole-temperatures-may-soar-to-50-degrees-above-normal/ …
#Christian @JohnCornyn proves he doesn't trust @Pontifex on #GlobalWarming & is an #unfit idiot on tax payer income?
@theblaze ignorant fool
"One place = THE WHOLE WORLD!" -John Cornyn
I have a job, therefore there is no unemployment problem in the country.
It done snowed somewhere cold! Earth can STILL be my garbage can! #HerpDerp
if you have kids or grandkids, I recommend you read up on the concept of "climate change" @theblaze
@theblaze Probably because Obama just banned oil drilling and Jupiter got pleased. Oh wait, in the desert?
so today you got #owned by @Craigipedia, #education is key to avoiding that. I hear they have some of that even in #Texas.
