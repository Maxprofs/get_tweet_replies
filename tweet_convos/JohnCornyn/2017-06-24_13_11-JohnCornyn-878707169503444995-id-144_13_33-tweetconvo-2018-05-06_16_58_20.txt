Slight amendment: 60y/o @30K would pay higher premiums in every county in all these states except 2 in OH https://twitter.com/RonBrownstein/status/878699323181105153 …
What evidence is there that the states want to help pass those savings along to constituents. Texas wouldn't even expand Medicaid?!?!!!!!!??
Lol! Your not that dumb to think thats enough to help?
I guess senator Cornyn is saying the $100B will keep 23 million people,on insurance?
Why is your interpretation of #Medicaid so different from @SenatorCollins? #NoCutsToMedicaid #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare
.@SenatorCollins to @GStephanopoulos: "The Senate bill is going to have more impact on the Medicaid program than even the House bill." 
How? Care to explain or just magic?
BTW you better fix SSI only way you know (screw ppl) because there will be a spike in those ppl because they won't be able to afford HC
Best case scenario $100B for 20M ppl over 10 years is $500 annually pp if all of it goes to decreasing premiums
Oooh another bandaid! Are you a democrat?
You aren't going to put all into decreasing premiums and it's going to be way more than 20 million so stop lying
That's not going to do anything for us you liar
These replies seem to be running 50:3 against the bill, @JohnCornyn staffer. Please let your boss know that Texans do not want this bill.
Quit with the BS! You know your HC bill sucks.....give it a rest! What r they giving you to tweet this BS?
Again, why is govt money being used for insurance for individuals?
remember that pre existing conditions and essential health benefits don't have to be covered. And you are wiping out Medicaid.
Hope you have answers for Peter at the Pearly Gates but you don't believe in any of that mumbo jumbo.Xtian stuff is all for show right John?
You have no clothes
Not sold on your BS that guts healthcare for poor and greatly increases premiums and deductibles for seniors to give tax breaks to the rich.
"Can be" isn't the same as "must be" or even "will be," though.
"Can be" but will they?
If the premiums are too expensive what good is a small decrease? Lying
That is false
Same Senate obstructionists who sabotaged #ACA by refusing to fund risk corridors & refusal of Medicaid expansion. Now you want our trust?
As for @DanPatrick and @GregAbbott_TX, innovate and stable are not words that apply to these racist, misogynistic, hateful dipsh!ts.
OMG I can't retweet this enough! But you forgot @tedcruz!
Where's does the $100b come from?  Repeal Obamacare get rid of it. We don't need a different socialist program we need no socialist programs
What happens after 2026? Especially with all the federal revenue sources repealed?
@RonBrownstein @30K as 60 year old in Dallas cnty my premium goes up 209% b4 Texas forces me to high risk pool for more $ 4 less
YOU ARE LYING @JohnCornyn! Texans will DIE under this plan! Shame on you, I can't wait to VOTE YOU OUT!
Have you read this bill?  Stop trying to con us.
Recall that the Senate bill will drive up marginal tax rates as high as 80%.  https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2017/06/23/republican-senate-healthcare-bill-creates-scary-marginal-tax-rates/amp/ …
But red states like Texas rejected the Medicaid expansion. Why should we expect this to play out any differently.
Admit it. YOU drafted this bill with plenty of ways for states to shirk their duty to constituents - & TX will lead the way. #shameful
Please don't mince words... Haha!
#shameonyou  #StopWordSmithing #StopTrumpcare #EnoughIsEnough
Can be and will be are two different things.
Important you return the ACA's 3.8% investment tax to wealthy patrons. After all the market has stagnated from @11k to over 21k since ACA
And you know that won't address the need and is far below what is available through the ACA. Admit you want poor Americans to die.
I see your at the Koch summit .How much did they pay you to get there tax break
So... when I can't pay 4 healthcare w/o bankruptcy, can I send u the bills? When I'm denied b/c of a genetic disorder, you'll pay? #biteme
Lifetime cap on benefits.

This is the @GOP DEATH BILL. 

#SwampOfLiars
#TheResistance
100B over how long?
@GOP planning to add clause that if you miss a payment, you can't have insurance for 6 months.
This is the GOP DEATH BILL.
Recall that campaign promises were healthcare for all, allow preex conditions, and no cuts to Medicaid?
So, you're a liar.
That's over 8 years. A pittance compared to what you're gutting. And you left out an important part. Wait for iiiiiiit:
States have to provide MATCHING funds to receive those benefits.
16 states wouldn't pony up 10% to get a 90% fed payment on Medicaid expansion. Why do you assume they'll provide $100 bil in matching funds?
Btw, this is why your bill is so short. It doesn't actually do anything. It sets aside small amounts of money with strings that states are
Unlikely to meet in hopes that the states will provide the kind of innovation that you won't, and that they've proven uninterested in doing.
Yet you parade this relatively small funds around as a triumph. Proving again that this entire bill is about optics and not real solutions.
Still trying to put lipstick on the pig while you crush millions of people
@RonBrownstein @30K wow!  Just realized u r w/o Koch brothers in CO today instead of here in TX mtg your voters - excuse me!
@RonBrownstein U seem to think that tweeting out alt-facts somehow makes them true & that it counts as talking to constituents.
Ah yes, a euphemism for kicking the sick and old out into the cold.
Percentage Of People Medicaid Covers &  Harmed By GOP Gutting Of Medicaid
Uh huh. Sure they will
100 billion over what time? How managed? Who gets it?  Otherwise it means nothing
Remove state lines for competition would drop premiums & allow major medical product for lower income. Less subsidy, add competition.
Hey @JohnCornyn @JohnCornyn staffer are you reading these tweets from us Texans to your boss?
This x1000. The marketplace that BCRA sets up seems completely unsustainable.
BRAC Subsidies are less generous and the plans are skimpier - so you’re asking people to spend same amount of money to buy worse plan.
Remember Texas hates this bill and we now hate you.
Leave the ACA alone!

Is "state innovation" the term you are using to allow insurance companies to deny maternity care?
Yes and TX will gladly not accept a dime cause it helps the poor. @GregAbbott_TX and @DanPatrick hate them almost as much as Mexicans
Stop trying to sell us this garbage
@JohnCornyn buzz words like 'state innovation' don't mean anything to the 23 million ppl that will lose HC under the senate #healthcare bill
@JohnCornyn So 1-19-17 CNN live 45 stated he gave U a lot of $ & get to work. Constituents want to know who do you work for? Career over.
Remember Watergate? Forty were indicted and spent in prison.
So you think this is all about premiums? Coverage, deductibles, BENEFITS & premiums, nut job! Oh and MEDICAID! #CanCornyn20 #NoAHCA
@RonBrownstein @30K saying our state will help ANYONE not rich or Christian zealot is a LIE!! This bill kills a lot of people!!
You're cutting taxes by $600 billion for the rich and corporations. .01% will see a tax cut of $209,000.Are the Koch brothers satisfied yet?
So why is the Senate HC bill forcing employees to pay more for HC insurance as their income increases? https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2017/06/23/republican-senate-healthcare-bill-creates-scary-marginal-tax-rates/amp/ …
After you rejected the TX Medicaid expansion and let your constituents suffer and die, there's no faith in state's ability to do anything.
It doesn't have to be complicated. Insurance is a product that one can purchase; so let us if we want it. Cvr only ppl who are in dire need.
So lifetime caps and preexisting conditions won't be a factor at all? Because that's what kills people...fyi
The only people who say this bill is good is the GOP .What about the 1 million that will lost jobs and rural areas lose hospitals
You're repugnant John Cornyn. You can't even be bothered to meet with constituents before the vote. You serve only yourself.
#LetThemEatCake
You mendacious aristocrat.

As a vet I'm appalled at what this bill means for vulnerable veterans, so you & you fellow elites get a tax cut.
So those of us in Texas are supposed to trust our Gov & Lt Gov? The 2 who are going to waste $ on a special session to determine bathrooms?
Don't forget spending billions fighting unconstitutional legislation they know they'll lose solely to pander to their base. #hb3859
That's a long term solution?
Ahh $100 Billion in insurance company bribes.  Little wonder they are creating a crisis to get this passed.
You've been in government for a quarter century. You're a walking ad for term limits.
More GOP senators are fleeing the sinking ship and vowing to vote no, John. Give it up. You've lost. No tax cut for wealthy.
@RonBrownstein @30K John, your constituents don't want it...I suggest you retract your support
Keep lying @JohnCornyn Literally no one believes in this wealthcare bill. Probably even fewer people than believe in you (reminder 28%). Sad

Please propose amendment subjecting Congress to TrumpCare.  No exceptions.  I dare you.
And how many disabled children pulled off Medicare, which will devastate working families? But Trump family gains millions, so it's ok.
it's a little tough for anyone to "recall" anything since you released it TWO days ago and will vote next week. Oligarchy.
How does this help 130k Texans on Med waiver waiting lists at risk of institutionalization? Or families like this:
If it doesn't lower premiums to pre-Obamacare it's just another crap bill from GOP blowhards!
Bottom Line: Exactly how much of a tax credit do your friends need? How many ppl have to die to achieve it? Shame on you Cornyn. #TurnTXBlue
Why don't you tell everyone that you and 24 other Republican senators voted to allow Obama care to pass with a 50-/51vote? U caused this.
This is a drop in the bucket compared to an industry that impacts 1/6 of the US economy. VOTE NO!! Work for ALL Texans not just rich people
Perhaps you think that people will think 100 billion is a Large Number and be confused. This is nothing like enough to do anything.
operative phrase is "can be.."  who'd ever swallow that rancid lump of bait?  your sole objective is a massive tax break for Kochs et al.
Recall...

"I think this will trick them, guys, unless my constituents are proficient in basic mathmatics." - @JohnCornyn
There is no way to defend with integrity a bill that guts health care for the poor, old, and sick in order to give tax cuts to the rich.
What about the 60 year old millionaires? And how much would the premiums be? Do I get #femalecare? I can't afford another child!
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
Bill Cassidy says he's undecided on Trumpcare, but he made a promise to this cancer mom. Don't let him forget it.…
I see by all the responses to this tweet (including mine) there's a lot of mistrust with what the states will do. Maybe governors reassure?
What makes U think U need 2 provide everything 4 everyone?  U big Gov types tick me off! #tcot #tlot #teaparty @FriscoTeaParty @MarkDavis
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
A horrific metaphor for Trumpcare: this disabled woman literally being ripped from her wheelchair. 
#StopTrumpcare  
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
Police drag away protesters, some in wheelchairs, outside of Sen. McConnell's office after draft of Senate health care bill is revealed 
So Texans are supposed to rely on Dan Patrick & Greg Abbott to employ state innovation & stability?  Sure- I trust you....
that's a very scary possibility.
I was told he does do some of the tweeting himself & he is an idiot imo.
And that makes up for the 600billion in tax cuts how?
Like the way you could improve funding for public education in Texas? No but let's have a special session on a pointless bathroom bill!
And a ton of tax cuts for the wealthy, and a gutting of Medicare.  #Traitor #NoCutsNoCaps
Haha. And I suppose Texas will embrace that option just as it did the option to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Puh-lease!
Yeah -- Good luck offsetting 800% premium increases (if your opaque bill is similar to the House GOP bill)
"In NE's Chase County, a 62-yr-old earning $18K could pay nearly $20K for coverage under GOP plan." Under ACA: $760. https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-health-plan-would-hit-rural-areas-hard-1489364405 …

Read and save this thread. The Senator goes through the McConnell Trumpcare bill point by awful point. https://twitter.com/senbobcasey/status/877916165229641728 …
Let's hope that each state will do the right thing with these funds, Senator. I love living in Texas, but Gov. Abbott is super conservative
Abbott would let us all die. Especially if we're not white. He's got to go, too. #TurnTXBlue
Recall the Senate bill decimates Medicaid without which millions of families will be in bankruptcy. Sen.Cornyn: please be honest with us.
100B compared to the 18% of our 20 trillion GDP. That means you are using 100B to hold back around a 4 trillion tsunami of health spending.
Kind of reminds me of those ridiculous paper gowns you wear at the hospital that leave your backside exposed. That's your stability fund.
Recall that this "healthcare" bill is an artfully disguised $600 billion tax cut for the wealthy, you sociopathic aristocrat.
Why is Trumpcare Medicaid impact structured so the harshest cuts fall outside of CBO scoring window? Trying to hide something?
AHCA is a conjob.
Sure. The way you "could" have fair voting districts instead of gerrymandering. The way you "could" be a fair and impartial check on POTUS.
You've shown time and again your interests are with your donors and not us. Stop trying to sell a bill that reeks. We see right through it.
Did you vote for Cornyn
Yeah, that's not likely to happen in your own state.
**can be used...**
You're so dishonest. You know this will means loss of coverage for millions of the most vulnerable Americans.
Recall that you somehow expect us to believe your and your colleagues lies if you repeat them enough?
