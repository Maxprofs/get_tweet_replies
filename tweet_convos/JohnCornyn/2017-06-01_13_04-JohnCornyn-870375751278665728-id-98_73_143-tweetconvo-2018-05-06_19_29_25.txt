Impeach trump
And the psychos come out 
I don't think they can help it; it's now a disease that has eaten into their souls. 
Keep drinking that Trump Koolaid.
Thank you for your permission; we all wait with bated breath for those unique invitations. 
This is a global mistakes
The only mistake was OBAMA
First this is not a left or right issue it is a human problem you can't use money if you don't have a planet it's scientifically proven
He doesnt represent me or anyone I know. Cornyn is a sellout.
He is a sellout!
@JohnCornyn is wrong, and his constituents know it. 77077
Withdrawal from the #ParisAccord signals that these politicians care more for their own interests than those of the country or the planet!

That is because John has been paid off big time.
Oil & gas: $1,101,456
 Coal: $33,050
 Total: $1,134,506
#TheResistance
Bought & paid for by the oil industry
Clean energy is the future ... now we will be left behind!! How can you be SO shortsighted w/ our economy & our planet??  #ShameOnYou

How Was A Climate Crisis Denier Elected President of The United States? #ParisAgreement #ParisClimateDeal 
Watch http://bit.ly/ClimateDenierPOTUS … 
It's not job killing. Renewables are outpacing coal. This eliminates America's role as an international leader.
The fact that Cornyn is applauding the weakening and diminishing of American leadership is deplorable.
Wonder if this influenced your decision you obstructionist shill for all things DT snd oil/gas?
*and*
I sure the $1124.506 Paid to you from oil gas and coal had nothing to do with your statement backing Trump
How much oil do you have to guzzle before writing something like this seems like a good idea?
Can't wait to vote against you.
This and Cornyn's support if AHCA is his ticket out of office. Country over party. Are you Trussian too Mr. Cornyn?
Obviously you don't listen to your constituents.
So it's economy over ecology, John? Who needs clean air when you have MONEY? You don't have a shred of humanity left in you, do you?
I can't wait to vote you out in your next election.
Hope this applause makes you lose your next election
John Cornyn is not a reliable source of information.
You are one of many despicable lying, selfish grifters. No shame. John Cornyn, Texas
Oil & gas: $1,101,456, Coal: $33,050
Total: $1,134,506
We need a #townhall! none of your staffers can adequately defend your comments here or on AHCA!! #NoAHCA #ACA #ActOnClimate #ParisAgreeement
How are you going to apologize to the planet?
@POTUS goes to Saudi Arabia.. 

Meets with Fox/Twitter owner Alwaleed Bin Talal..

Returns with 12 Million Bots!

Today's energy jobs are in solar, not coal
Wait until the coastal cities are underwater & say the same thing. Cling to your carbon security blanket
Dear John, way to lead from behind. "America first" is going to end up costing us all dearly. P.s.  Who bought you?
2018 we get rid of Cruz, 2020 we adios Cornyn.
You are an embarrassment to all of TX. Good Luck keeping your seat. How stupid do you have to be. Really. I'm asking. #CorruptGOP
What the hell, Cornyn? I expect stupidity from Scruz but you know we are moving to natural gas, not oil, in Texas. Stop being a patsy!
I hope you have a gig lined up after this term, sellout. #ParisAccords
Shame on you for this short-sited and egocentric decision. You have let down our country, planet and future generations.
Projected replacement cost of Gulf Coast energy infrastructure by 2030: ~400 billion. http://texasseagrant.org/assets/uploads/blog/TheRiskofRisingSeaFinal.pdf …
Buh-bye.
Shopworn, antique political rhetoric to paper over a witless decision. The future will continue without you, thanks.
Wow. Given that Houston Heights is 29 ft above sea level, just wow.
You are on the wrong side of history @JohnCornyn
I thought you were smarter than than that  Senator.  Even TX knows that going green  means more green. 
.@JohnCornyn It's mostly just sad you & DT will be on the wrong side of history. You'll probably be long gone. What about Houston's future?
Yet again on wrong policy side. Too much obstructionism has led to inability or unwillingness to govern positively. Townhall schedule 4 TX?
can't wait for the sky to be consumed by fire because our senators cared a lot about shareholder value, what a bunch of idiots
This statement is exactly what we expected from the TX contingent of The Ministry of Propaganda & Complete Bullshit.
800,000 renewal energy jobs vs 50,000 coal jobs. Coal plants are closing across the globe. Coryn and the @GOP math is fiction.
Mr. Cornyn you are so wrong!  Texans want clean air/water!  Nothing else matters if we can't breathe the air or drink the water #doyourjob
The Senator can FUCK himself. He's a traitor to his country for supporting traitors to their country.
You will be on the wrong side of history....again. If humanity even survives to HAVE a history
Pulling out of the Paris Agreement is clear evidence of ignorance & stupidity.
You, senator, have absolutely lost your humanity.
There will be NO economy because of the shortsightedness of this decision.
The real reason you're all in 

@JohnCornyn's take:
Oil & gas: $1,101,456
Coal: $33,050
Total: $1,134,506
He *only* needs $1,134,506 to sell out the planet and it's inhabitants 
Says Cornyn as the mouthpiece for his biggest donor group
The United States isn't really part of the rest of the world anyway, is it?#Ignorant #PoorLeadership #Sycophant #TrumpsPuppet

Hey John, do you ever read the replies?  Not looking very positive here. Better stick to airplane ride tweets.
War on energy producers? 2 largest American energy production companies, XOM and CVX, both oppose leaving Paris. #falsepremise & a #badlook

I will remember you and all who supported this stupid decision.  Greed stole your common sense!
He along with the president are so wrong.  Sad.
Like Anderson to J Lord, "if 45 took a dump on his desk you would be ok with it" that's what you have lowered yourself to johnny boy $$$$$$
Another reason this will be his last term.
I totally agree with that statement
How do you call yourself a Christian and care so little for God's creation?

Good! It was never anything agreed to by Congress anyway -- anything signed by one person can be undone by another... 
Hey John, Texans don't like puppets with no backbone, and that is what  you have become; a puppet of Rump & Putin. Shame on you.
Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah

I hope America has its scuba gear ready because we are all going to be underwater in 50 years.
Once again, you are putting your ignorance on display. Please provide data that would prove the Accord would alter your "forecast".
Jerk. Wrong side of history. Again.
@JohnCornyn cheering Trump as he leads us to join hands with Syria & Nicaragua in rejecting #ParisAccord & fighting rest of world.
Only Syria. Nicaragua didn't join because they didn't think the agreement went far enough.
It's always good when the US doesn't live up to its international obligations.
Worlds #1 Terrorist If Seen Call the FBI #TRUMPRUSSIA
Coal industry is dead. Renewable energy employs more and protects the planet. The private sector is already moving towards renewable.
Cornyn is a partisan hack who could use an education.
Can't wait to vote @tedcruz  and @JohnCornyn  out!
As a Texan, I can't wait to vote them back in! 
Here's the thing about JC, he hates his constituents loves his corporation $$$ who pollute our state & the world.
Exxon is his largest donor. Of course he wants to protect oil - his profits matter more to him than our county or the planet! Evil man!
Much stock in OIL and coal?? Yea, it's all about their own greed!! 
Fits the needs of businesses while killing our planet.
You are as big a traitor as he is.  The world and sane Americans will never forget or forgive.  #RESIST #IMPEACHTRUMP
Kiss Ass. I thought Texans had backbone.
Definitely not Texas senators
