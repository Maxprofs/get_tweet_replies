First Amendment vital to Nation for over 2  Centuries & a free press is cornerstone. Totalitarian control starts with media & ends with us.
...more drivel from our ineffective do-nothing senior Sen, has to take these crazy positions because he's lost respect of his GOP donors.
OMG!  The world is coming to an end.  Cornyn and I agree in something!!
If you believed that, you would stop enabling a narcissistic bully whom attacks our critically important free press every chance he gets!
So what are you doing about potus' demonization of free press? Shame on you.
Dead in the water
My first ever like of a John Cornyn tweet!  
B. S. The trump is trying to control and manipulate the free press. You should be calling out trump on his Fake News B.S.
So why does Trump want to get rid of it.

Who is considered "press" and can government be trusted with that decision?
When and where will your August town hall be?
CORRECTION, starts with TRUMP & Trumpsters & ends with THE RESISTANCE from knowledgeable Patriotic Americans!
Totalitarianism starts with men in high office who grasp for more power than the citizens have granted.
https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2017/08/03/tangled-web-connects-russian-oligarch-money-gop-campaigns …  Should foreign governments be able to buy influence in our elections? How will this be stopped?
It didn't help Hillary this last go round.
Then stand up to the anti-American president. History will remember what you do now. You are not showing courage.

As we've seen on TV? 
I agree with (and trust) Acevedo. I hope you support a free press but your earlier posts (and your reputation) make me question if you do.
You condone trump actions with silence. Can't trust executive, legislative, judicial branches of govt. Putin won the cold war on your watch.
You are cowardly for saying this in a tweet. You should be challenging trump on every issue that he lies about and deceives the public about
So which one us it, freedom of the press or lock up reporters for reporting? U post a contradicting 2014 story just hours after this post.
Idiot.
Who says cops will be distracted by checking papers and could be  catching real criminals. He should be investigated for accepting bribes.
Wow. And that is what you call a pivot.
Then why don't you listen and stand up and say something when you hear everything is "fake news"?
Except likes of @CNN have become the enemy so what gives....
Do you even read the tweets your social media employee posts? 
That's it Senator? How about sending a letter to your homeboy Sessions not to target journalists
This is what a President of the US who knows and respects our Constitution says to the press!
You are morally bankrupt, just like Trump is!
you are saying well said but you just said the opposite before! You know this administration is corrupt as hell. Where is your red line?
Your post is a misquote!

love @ArtAcevedo  !  Comrade Cornyn, you need to get honesty and integrity back- sold your soul to the highest bidder @txlege
You literally just called for the journalists to be sued and subpoenaed, you idiot. Could you be any more clueless?
I think we know he can.
As @ExDHS correctly stated
Some seem to be propagandist and yellow journalists.
Sorry...what?
Impeach Trump
Uh, did you not read that before retweeting? He's saying the exact opposite of the bs you've been spewing here.
Funny where were all these lefties when Obama was jailing reporters??
Sen John Coryn...congratulations on contributing to Totalitarian Control and supporting a Pathologic Liar and Deranged Clown
The media controls the message!
So if you want limits on journalists and confidentiality,  turn it around.
Under what conditions should journalists be required to disclose and how do journalists maintain protection for self and sources?
You do your best to hide the truth about this administration.
With all due respect, Mr. President and Attorney General Sessions, it appears you can't handle the truth. https://www.facebook.com/theDanRather/posts/10159125119210716 …
@SenateGOP @HouseGOP @GOP @JohnCornyn @tedcruz @RepKevinBrady @SenateMajLdr @POTUS @WhiteHouse   Trump says, "What would Putin Do?".
You know the Russia meddling is real. Is now REALLY the time to engage in this, Senator?
You're contributing to the erosion of our free press. You are certainly no constitutionalist.
Does the 1st amendment apply to publishing classified info illegally obtained?????????????
He's rebuking you, Senator. And rightly so.
How about some action to back up your tweet?
You just described the right wing playbook
Heading to La BbQ. Town Hall?

Robert Mueller is superb choice to be special counsel. His reputation is impeccable for honesty and integrity. Media should now calm down

#Syria might not be in the news any more but the planes still fill the sky and the bombs they drop are still killing and maiming thousands 
Common sense lives, I'm so glad to live in a city where the leaders believe these basic American truths.
And yet the president keeps calling fake news...

So why don't you do something about it instead of posting Fox News propaganda?

https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/07/bill-browders-testimony-to-the-senate-judiciary-committee/534864/ … Everyone!! Blow up this article with likes/retweets!!!! This is what Putin wants to turn the US into!!! #TrumpRussia

"This is the health care story that nobody talks about.” Thanks to @SteveKoff for this important read. http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2017/08/trump_administration_wants_to.html …

This physician/insurance company CEO says that #ACA isn't failing.
It's being sabotaged by Trump.
