You could reply to this tweet and act like a statesman.... Let me show you.  This guys a class act!  He may even give u retweet envy.
In our thoughts and prayers.
Praying for people of Mexico.
My heart breaks for Mexico!

My heart goes out to the sufferers. A terrific moment after the first one in two weeks.
Sad
Awful.

Mexico doesnt learn its lesson. Building codes not up to par, @mexico get your head out of your ass. I lost my father in 85 because of BS
I cannot believe some ppl are using the loss of lives to speak against DACA and illegal Mexicans. It's just wrongful.
My prayer goes to Mexico

Hey @AP do we really need a death toll update every 20 minutes?  Earthquake. Very sad. We get it. Enough w/ the shock headlines.  Christ.
Egocentric much? Has it occurred to you that people affected & their families can use this info to measure future risk? Info is valuable
Shock headlines do not benefit anyone except the news organizations that produce them
So sad prayers to all Mexico!  They claim when there is a total eclipse the hurricanes are stronger and more frequent!

The death toll is rising so quickly. That's so sad!
Can you just update it at the end of the day instead of every 5 minutes?
Good thing this is for the affected ones and their families and not bystanders
affected ones and families are calling and texting each other to see if they’re safe. They’re not watching AP’s reported death count rise.
just say you dont care about brown people and go
He's not wrong but sure go ahead and make something of nothing.
thank u white man

USGS is forecasting between 100-1000 fatalities and about $1 billion in damage. https://on.doi.gov/2yoim47 
And still a 2nd rate " story" per MSM.  SHAME ON YOU @MSNBC @cnnbrk @CNN  @FoxNews
Not good at all. This is terrible news 
Im bettingvon 227
U.S. stands with Mexico
AYE Yye Yye
It is disgusting how news outlets love keeping count of deaths when disaster strike. Instead, post a phone number to donate to the victims.

False, I love Mexico
awful! 
 sending prayers
do we really need a live death count update every minute?
YES WE DO!
Prayers for Mexico 
120* 
Terrible tragedy. Maybe the toll will not rise much higher.
It will, unfortunately. There are thousands missing and the buildings keep collapsing.
