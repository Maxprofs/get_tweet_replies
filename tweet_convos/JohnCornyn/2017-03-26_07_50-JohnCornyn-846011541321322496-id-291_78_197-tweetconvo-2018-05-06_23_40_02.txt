.@RepAdamSchiff says events of the week underscore the need for an independent commission to give the country confidence in investigation.
What if Kushner claims Executive Privilege in a closed session of #SenateIC? The outrage will be convulsive and wreck us.
I hope so.  I'm not too confident yet.
Do you (or staff, more likely) read what your constituents are saying?  You should.
Why are you so opposed to an #IndependentCommission ? It's like you're hiding something...
I disagree.  Chairman Nunes has a direct COI and his recent behavior demonstrates this point
We don't trust the Senate. There's no reason to not have an independent commission to investigate.
@Syndeess @JohnCornyn Be careful saying anything to Cornyn if U tell him to do his job he'll block you even his own constituents
I think he was once a decent guy,  has been in DC too long and caved in favor of partisanship.
after the Nunes show not feeling confident, that any of you will put country over party.
I feel you. IMO though nunes is personally compromised. Burr seems a bit more likely to follow the law 
holding my breathe until march 30 though
what's march 30th?
first senate hearing on trumpnrissia. Expected to be more serious, maybe explosive, than house.
thank you!  So it's open?
yeah I think it's to be televised to public like the house last monday?
I will check. If it's closed, we may not hear anything. That is why Dems are upset with Nunes...
THANK YOU
Looks like GOP strategy is to proclaim treason doesn't matter. Indicates complicity in the scam & cover up. Don't trust them.
Prove it! We demand action, not a 4-yr investigation. Shouldn't be that hard to prove - we're watching to see IF our govt is working for us
.@JohnCornyn @OrrinHatch @SenMajLeader @SenateGOP Like that Merrick Garland confidence-earning hearing? #FakePresident #PutinStooge
I'm a constituent & you don't have my trust. You fail to speak out against anything Trump-related, despite repercussions for TX
Only an independent commission or special prosecutor will have the trust of our country. #TrumpRussiaCollusion
@FaceTheNation @RepAdamSchiff Sorry, Corny, you're as crooked as the rest. #noconfidence #2020
It's disturbing that anybody would think that, with all that's gone on.
Our populace is deeply divided and distrustful.  Will your hearings be public?
Doubt it! Independent commission!!
From sham to champagne, huh? ... Are we talking one week or two after nun-a-ya is in stocks. Get Serious.
problem is they don't have that confidence now.
That's not possible Senator. As one of your constituents I urge you support independent prosecutor. Country over prty one time.
The American ppl demand an Independent commission - we don't trust ur "bipartisan" efforts. Trump & GOP have shattered our trust in govt.
Cornyn. Really? You WHINE that TREASON is investigated, butthe propaganda & lies by chaffetz & gowdy. U mock ppl with lies.
#Listen, we need an #IndependantInvestigation. Nunes has shown Congress can't do this.
we want an Independent Investigation.  Nunez has shown where his loyalties lie.
maybe so but GOPs credibility on doing the right thing is low.  I'm for an independent commission.
@FaceTheNation @RepAdamSchiff then at least replace @DevinNunes
@FaceTheNation @RepAdamSchiff  
LIES , Nunes compromised this investigation we need special prosecuterb
.@JohnCornyn Sir, this has nothing to do w party affiliation. It has to do w Russia taking over our govt fr the inside. Trump must go!
Senators really should not Tweet while drunk.
Thank you for your leadership.
Maybe you should give Devin Nunes some lessons?
That's a good start, now how about making it an #IndependentCommission so the world can believe you too?
Talk is cheap. Republicans in Congress were given a chance to investigate and D. Nunes turned it into a farce. No second chances
@billpostmus Schiff is a schill
@StevenTDennis I trust you mean ALL the country: red, blue, purple & every other color of the rainbow #TrumpRussiaCollusion
@StevenTDennis
You've yet to earn mine, @JohnCornyn.
yeah right! Like the way you buried the last SCOTUS nominee? #StolenSeat
we need an independent investigation into @realDonaldTrump and his Russian ties, do your job! We the people will remember & vote
Nunez must testify
You cannot conduct a proper investigation with @DevinNunes at the helm.  He has cast an even darker shadow over the process
@StevenTDennis we need an independent commision , the longer you refuse the more guilty the GOP looks
No, We need & want a Special Prosecutor. This investigation is obviously not bipartisan so far. Wishing will not make it so.
If u care abt citizens & constituents, pls request Independent Commission handle investigation@DevinNunes black cloud #notrust
we demand an #IndependentCommission and you need to listen to your constituents.
no it isn't
WRONG. Plus, if there's nothing to hide, why not support an independent commission? Time is running out to be on the right side.
GOP intends to cover it all up. I trust Schiff and Warner. But repubs?? Meh.
@FaceTheNation @RepAdamSchiff You're wrong. GOP will screw that up too. We DEMAND an inde, select commission on #trumprussia.
As soon as @SenatorBurr recuses himself, maybe.
Democracy demands absolute integrity in this investigation. Burr talked to press at WH behest. That's a problem.
@StevenTDennis Foul! Nunez is not independent 1) talking to White House before committee 2) cancelling hearing for BS reasons
I read Vincent Bugliosi kept going to visit Charles Manson in jail to warn him of the evidence against him. Early Devin Nunes??
What do you have against an independent commission? All GOP leaders are compromised.
we don't trust any of you to do this right. We need an independent 9/11-style commission on this. We don't know how deep it goes
bipartisan is not a synonym for independent. #IndependantInvestigation
@StevenTDennis Gowdy wants to keep hearings from public. I don't trust anything but Nunes recusal & independent investigaion
As voter from your home state of Texas, I DEMAND independent investigation of the Trump campaign & admin connections to Russia.
@StevenTDennis Really?
Yeah, we'll take the independent commission, thanks.
It cant be worse than the clown show run by Nunes in the House, but still need independent investigation. @RepAdamSchiff @GOP
I guess you forgot where Priebus convinced @SenatorBurr to go to the press. https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-administration-sought-to-enlist-intelligence-officials-key-lawmakers-to-counter-russia-stories/2017/02/24/c8487552-fa99-11e6-be05-1a3817ac21a5_story.html …
Trump and the GOP have destroyed any trust that you may have had prior to this election. Independent investigation!
ZZZZZZzzzz ZZZZZZzzzz ZZZZZZzzzz...
as McEnroe often said "you cannot be serious?!
you clearly have contempt for your constituents and all Americans, for that matter. Devin Nunes has sullied the "investigation."
@StevenTDennis @FaceTheNation If Burr stays clear of the WH going forward. He’s got one publicly visible strike so far.
@RiegerReport give me a break.
Burr is tainted just like Nunes for calling reporters to push back on Trump-Russia reporting they don't like
way to go!
the senate intelligence committee is not bipartisan
NOT GOOD ENOUGH!.  Burr, especially, is not impartial.
ONLY and independent investigation will do!
Great!!  Because you've proved yourself to be unbiased. 
it's not bipartisan.  We deserve to know the truth for the sake of our democracy. It's been compromised and we need an indpt.
Not so bipartisan when Nunes runs to the Prez w/"info" he doesn't share. That sorta killed the bipartisan aspect. #TrumpRussia
The events of the last two weeks have demonstrated that after 8 years, you're not overly interested in our trust.
.@JohnCornyn I will reserve comment until I see what you do. You've been too big of a cheerleader of this suspect administration.
that seems doubtful when Nunes is secretly briefing 45.
You mean the 1 where Nunes goes running to Trump w new evidence instead of Committee and now won't show or disclose source?
It sounds like you already have this decided. I'll reserve judgement until I see what you do. We'll see if you earn anything.
Um, no. I have zero confidence in the Senate Intel Committee. Independent Commission, please.
the country doesn't need another special prosecutor- take care of the people's business not persecuting other party
Given that Nunes keeps communicating with POTUS who is being investigated for treason, an independent investigator is needed.
we need an independent investigation
I hope you can be impartial. You have been quite the cheerleader/apologist for Trump so far. Country over party, please!
we'll see after all @SenatorBurr made phone calls on @POTUS behalf to down play Russian stories.
I sincerely hope so Senator Cornyn. The House has not been able to do so, and Devin Nunes has taken bizarre actions.
It would also be a vote of confidence if you joined Representative Schiff in calling for Speaker Ryan to remove Nunes as chair.
Something is very, very wrong with the current administration and we need to know the full extent.
As burned, or raw, as many of us feel "bipartisan"
is not as credible as "independent".
@FaceTheNation @RepAdamSchiff you did not want it. You dismissed it. You are no leader.
Too late. Nunes has made a mockery of this. We need an independent investigation to get to the truth of Trump/Russia.
@RepAdamSchiff What is your objection to an independent investigation? Why would "bipartisan" be better?
oh please....
Bipartisan is NOT independent, particularly when Republicans control your Cmte and Sen. We need INDEPENDENT investigation!
I sure hope so cuz that BS that happened in house last week was No Good! Separate ur self and stand up against corruption !!
We need an INDEPENDENT COMMISSION.
as @SenJohnMcCain said, congress is incapable of such an investigation. We need a special prosecutor!
Bipartisan my Arse, Chairman taking orders from Trump, cancelling public hearings. Nothing Bipartisan about it.
You have got to be joking. Nunes has compromised it beyond repair. Do you want the truth or just trying to save the party?
@RepAdamSchiff - Americans want independent SELECT committee with full investigative & subpoena powers. We don't trust Nunes
@ReaganBattalion meybel but independen is better!
you GOPers are corrupt.
too late.
please start with the BOTS PROPAGANDIZING FOR FASCIST GROSUCH ON THE WASHINGTON POST.
had better be true, because we have twitter. We'll know when a full accounting has or has not been rendered. Lots of work to do.
hint: there are bots all over the Washington Post comments section propagandizing for Gorsuch. Will that be detailed?
The face of partisanship in the senate says things are bipartisan?
SPECIAL PROSECUTER!
.@JohnCornyn No. There is NO REASON to avoid an independent committee. You want us to trust you, but WHY SHOULD WE?
this needs an independent investigator. Intelligence Committee is compromised. Devin Nunes botched it and needs to be removed
Uh, John you my wanna rethink this comment http://www.palmerreport.com/politics/devin-nunes-michael-flynn-turkey/2054/ …
I have no confidence that you can be nonbiased. You're too much a partisan hack and show it daily. Independent investigation.
what delusional part of trumps asylum are from John?
Burr, while not as compromised as Nunes, is still compromised.  Need independent committee.
We all are trusting that's the case. But in matters of trust, dc pols are not earning more and squandering what little they have
This constituent of yours wants an independent commission!
... with Senator "I'll call the press like Trump told me to" Burr?  Yeah, don't think so?
Why are you picking party over American security? I thought the GOP was about making America safer. Independent comm. is needed!
I don't trust Nunes. Needs to be totally independent. Please insist on it.
*Maybe* if Nunes steps down. Having a member of the transition team on this committee seems bizarre.
Independent please, Russian $ could be in everyone's pockets.
There should be a special prosecutor.
good because you all have lost ours #RussiaTrumpExxon
Sir our problem is @realDonaldTrump has told many lies that nobody trusts the Administration or him
#FakePresident
@TXGOPolitics
So then you admit that @DevinNunes' stunts are reasons to lose confidence in Congress' ability to investigate #Trumprussia?
Yes, sir. and DOJ Deputy AG can assign special counsel if FBI finds anything  ..  Commission cannot investigate.
always love hearing the Dems who didnt want to Invesitgate Hillary but want it now
We need an #IndependentCommission NOW!
.@JohnCornyn @ReaganBattalion Doubt it.Not as unhinged as Nunes, but Burr has also indicated he cares less about truth than protectin Trump.
I hope so. Because what it looks like just happened is that we suffered a coup.
@ReaganBattalion @FaceTheNation @RepAdamSchiff I'd like an investigation on Adam Schiffs ties to the Ukraine.  Glass houses smh
I am your constituent. I, like most Americans, respectfully demand a special prosecutor. #IndependentInvestigation
As do I.  We've got zero reason to trust you & GOP. #Trussiagate #Flynnghazi #GOPTreason
provided they aren't thinking of "self"
@ReaganBattalion oh please. That is still a partisan investigation. #WeThePeople demand a real #IndependentCommission
The only thing that gives me confidence in this stmt is that we haven't seen Senate IC Republican leaking info
@JohnCornyn @ReaganBattalion
Yeah, right
I will only support an #IndependentCommission. #CountrybeforeParty is the only way to the truth. #Trumprussia
@ReaganBattalion I do find it funny that Democrats on the Intel committee somehow think they are incapable of fairness? Nonsense
we are waaaaay past bipartisan. I mean, you're supposed to be bipartisan, yet here we are.
Except you have Democrats and Republicans in the committee making conflicting statements. Why do you fear a special prosecutor?
Rep Nunes is an embarrassment to Americans and the Republican Party. #IndependantInvestigation
Too late.  You have lost credibility.  Must be fully independent.
@PostimusMaximus  Can't begin to generate confidence without revealing some info/process of SIC.
Transparency #TrumpRussia #TrumpCyberspace #TrumpCyber #TrumpSavingsBank
.@JohnCornyn its just amazing how party before country you are!  Cant wait to vote you out of office.
I have little confidence in the GOP's independence from the White House vis a vis Russia.
INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION OR BUST!
are you not paying attn?  Nunes proved over the course of the last week that this is definitely not an impartial investigation.
did you completely miss what your colleague Nunes did this week? Nope, SIC is not good enough. Independent commission needed now
Don't believe it and their credibility is EVERYTHING if you want to clear your man.
Our forefathers and foremothers are rolling in their graves.
Nunes compromised the committee with his actions and should be investigated.  This is shameful and not fitting our democracy.
@All100Senators I'm sorry, but you cannot speak on this matter. We now we wonder about @DevinNunes & and if he's trustworthy.
are you paying attention? How do you deny the need for independent investigation with subpoena power? Our democracy is at stake.
From where I'm sitting you are ALL complicit. Please prove me wrong but I'd feel a lot better if congress stayed away from this
not buying that sir-  the committee is compromised
nope. Whatever confidence we had in the Intel Committee's investigation was shattered by Nunes last week.
I don't trust you. I am sure that I am not alone.
Nunes running to Pres Cheeto was despicable! Independent investigation is needed. Tired of the GOP old boys club. Looking forward to Nov '18
Arrest Nunes!
Looking forward to this happening. Will be looking to you for answers.
is there a reason you don't want a special investigator?!
How can we trust those who have voted for every piece of garbage 45/enablers have put out? #SpecialProsecutor
Intelligence and the Senate are oxymorons, such as you have created it. W.E. D.O.N.'T. T.R.U.S.T. Y.O.U. Own it. Next town hall?
I do not trust Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate this.  Must have a special prosecutor! #doyourjob
#IndependentCommission #indeis absolutely needed.  Nunes cannot be trusted to act independently.
...sure hope so.

confidence in government was permanently lost decades ago. We only pray you don't screw things up worse when opening mouth
bipartisan is not independent.
Needs to be each: bipartisan and independent - this is bad.
