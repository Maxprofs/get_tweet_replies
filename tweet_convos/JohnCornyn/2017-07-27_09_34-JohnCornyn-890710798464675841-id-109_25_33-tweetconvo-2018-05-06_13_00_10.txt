But they don't believe in freedom of choice.
If you have a pre existing condition you get to choose between bankruptcy or death
What needs to be REPEALED & REPLACED is the @GOP. HERE is who they're doing this for (It's NOT US):
Koch Brothers why won't you spend your money to promote good will & the betterment of our society instead of pushing your biased  agenda?
Because they're greedy sociopaths. They already have more money and power than they know what to do with, but they just need more and more.
Free to go bankrupt. Great.
#FreeToChoose To Die
bytheway "skinny repeal" is a Trojan horse to set up a secret committee of House & Senate Repubs who will write yet another repeal bill.
@ChrisMurphyCT says @HouseGOP intends to make "skinny repeal" law (remember many GOP senators claimed to hate it)
.@ChrisMurphyCT explains how the #SkinnyRepeal bill that Senate GOP doesn't want to become law...will become law. A must watch. 
I think a lot of people feel like their neck is in the healthcare guillotine and we're watching that blade come closer and closer...
Your choice is: Nothing!
So ashamed he's the person my state voted into office. Nothing but a pawn and a terrible excuse for a public servant.
How can anyone support this ?
Freedom to choose (unless you're a woman)
No.
He calls it Free to Choose. I call it Free to Die.
To me it is the Trump/GOP Plan.  They own it so they get their names on it.
More like "If you're not rich the GOP would prefer you just die already" plan.
I think he means the "free to die" plan.
"Free to choose a new Senator" plan
@redwyne @katieleslienews @JohnCornyn Thank you. I'll take it.
So the GOP is now... pro-choice?
A pile of poop by any other name smells as bad.
Well, I have a "Free to Choose" plan, too, and I will exercise it to vote for those who don't destroy my healthcare. #shameonyou
Marketing, just marketing.
As a former Republican, I can say that John has lost his love for America and democracy. He was, past tense, a man of honor. He lost path.
"Free to Choose Death" you mean
@GOP 
Watch that East Texas accent: he really said, "I win & you lose" plan. That's why JC doesn't have townhall mtgs in East Texas.
How about the DOA plan
Well, unless that choice involves women's reproductive rights.
"Free to Die"
Freedom to get sick and die plan
To bad GOP does not believe in Free to Choose for women's health...
"Free to Choose" is what we would have with full repeal and deregulation.  That is what all conservatives want
Free to choose to die early due to lack of health care? You're playing with people's lives!!
Wow wow wow  Free to Choose . Guess that name helps clear any conscience they might have had left. #FreeToChooselifeordeath 
Doesn't mean YOU have to call it that
Free to suffer would be a more accurate title!
How appropriate that it sounds like a cigarette slogan
It's not a "choice" when you cannot afford anything that actually covers your needs, John. That's just YOU voting to KILL people.
This is because @JohnCornyn already has good #healthcare for life. He's as craven and amoral as they come.
You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig.
Yes people can choose to spend 50% of their incomes on insurance premiums. Super.
Sure, because this bill's name is its whole problem. Thanks for fixing everything. Seriously, may we discuss at an ATX town hall??
It won't work. Universal healthcare is what we need.
You wish
No it is the starvation plan.  The only freedom is to go bankrupt in the event of a medical emergency!
@SenateGOP @HouseGOP @GOP @JohnCornyn @tedcruz @RepKevinBrady @Scaramucci @POTUS @realDonaldTrump   No it is the Free To Lose Plan.2018&2020
More like the "free to die or free to ride the premiums of those who pay". Cornyn is becoming more anti-Christian & anti-American everyday
Cornyn hates Americans....doesn't represent Texans.  Suck up to Koch brothers who tell him how to vote.  Bastardized process = corruption
Free to choose to die.  Excellent plan!
That's like calling something an "incident" come on call it what what it is a pile of horse shit
I'm not a politician so you can quote me on that
Yea whatever! The GOP IS NOT for the American people and have FAILED US!!
Free to Choose to Die?  Free to Choose to Go Bsnkrupt if your child gets sick? Balderdash, Senator.
Eanie, MEANIE, MYNIE, MO$$$$ .... the quagmire thickens.  CHOICE?  Depends on the size of your wallet.
When it comes to Sen. Cornyn, the next time we Texans are "free to choose" is 2020.
I like to call it #Wealthcare
Free to choose what?
Don't trust this idiotic bill
Just call it TrumpcareFAIL
To have or not to have?
It's really a skeleton; stop lying.
The "free to make exchange plans only include sick people, and thus, be very expensive" plan. Insurance is pooled long term risk.
Ha
Free to choose either bad coverage or expensive coverage.
And we are free to choose who  we let stay in office.  And you Senator, are not one of them.
Sen Cornyn, this isn't marketing, it is lives.
I called my PCP to see if they would accept "freedom" as payment, and they hung up on me.
lol.....you trying to put lipstick on this pig ?
Bwahahahaha!!!! Gaslight alert!!!! #worstsenatorinusa

We find no evidence of the individual market collapsing. Rather, insurers on track to have best year since ACA began http://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/individual-insurance-market-performance-in-early-2017/ … 
Please provide a link to the full text of your plan, senator.

.@ChrisMurphyCT explains how Obamacare isn't dying — Trump is purposefully killing it 
free to choose between food & h/c.
Free to choose between nothing and a shit sandwich.
First time I've seen Senators agree to vote for a bill only if they are promised it will never become law. I have a better idea -- vote no.
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare #BCRA #AHCA #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
POINT 7: CBO lays blame for the insurer exit largely with Trump.   In fact... 12 
Haha no it's still skinny. #FullRepeal was a lie.
More like "Free to Die" plan.

 Here are the consumer protections the Cruz amendment wipes out: 
So ... the .@GOP is suddenly pro-choice?
Ins companies are screaming this will not work at allThe @GOP skating on thin ice close to ins deadlines or zero participation  #DumpTrump
And our bill was called the Affordable Care Act but you insisted on calling it Obamacare. Sometimes you don't get what you want @JohnCornyn.
Free to Choose not to be able to afford health insurance. Awesome.
More like the "Free to die when you don't have to die" plan.
...What We Offer"
free to choose to die.
and I CHOOSE for you poor motherfuckers not to have healthcare.
He wants his hashtag to take off SO BAD! Aw, if only it weren't deliberate obfuscation. Darn it.
Said the same on my show this morning.
They really did not think that name through.

So the choices are bankruptcy, urgent medical care or death, Senator Cornyn?
Milton Friedman, Nobel-prize-winning neoliberal to the stars.
yeah, insurers will be free to choose whether to cover you or not
 "i'm free, to die when i want, any old time"
HEY TEXAS HUMAN RIGHTS GLADIATORS MAKE SOME NOISE, NOW. SNOWFLAKES BRING ON THE WINTER! CALL, CALL, CALL! @GOP STILL TRYING TO KILL US ALL!
Double speak again.
John is great at crapping in our mouths and telling us it's chocolate!
"Free to choose" - food or ins. premium. Pay mortgage/rent or ins deductible. Pay for ins U can't afford - or DIE. It's BULLSHIT.
HEY TEXAS HUMAN RIGHTS GLADIATORS MAKE SOME NOISE, NOW. SNOWFLAKES BRING ON THE WINTER! CALL, CALL, CALL! @GOP STILL TRYING TO KILL US ALL!
OK, then I choose for Mr. Cornyn to not represent Texas in the Senate.
oh, he doesn't. He gets paid to, but he doesn't represent our interests.
HEY TEXAS HUMAN RIGHTS GLADIATORS MAKE SOME NOISE, NOW. SNOWFLAKES BRING ON THE WINTER! CALL, CALL, CALL! @GOP STILL TRYING TO KILL US ALL!
#SinglePayer
FTC/‘Skinny’ Obamacare Repeal https://nyti.ms/2tWRFA9  16 million lose care & premiums /deductibles soar #gapol
That'll be the day when I allow someone as inarticulate & an enemy of health care as @JohnCornyn to put words in my mouth.
To us it means “Delivering better insurance products with an easy user experience that exceeds expectations and provides simple ‘curated choice’, when and where our customers need it the most.”
