How is #GrahamCassidy not #Obamacare? It's just a different redistribution scheme of Obamacare. You should have repealed Ocare immediately.
A Federalist policy that harms far more people than a Socialist one isn't right or moral just because it's Federalism.
10th amendment doesnt allow the kind of Federalism Mr Cornyn thinks it does. But also... Running a secular society is an amoral affair.
Wrong. Indifference vs. compassion. WWJS? He cleansed the feet of the poor.
Obamacare isn't compassion. Terribly misguided.
Oh yes because offering consumer's protection's from greedy & opportunistic insurance companies is so evil.

Good argument, clearly you understand my position.
No, no, and no. We've interacted before and you lack any compassion for others.
Good take.
I'm blocked from that account so I must be doing something right! What do you call it when you take blue state  to fund poor red states?
Smart productive people supporting toothless inbred bumpkins?
Just more toothless bumpkin gibberish that is equally stupid to Cornyn's response. https://twitter.com/mikeydog/status/910303066775261184 …
This is all I see-
No worries. You're missing nothing of value from @MikeyDog  -- just the usual regurgitated @FoxNews propaganda. Yawn.
That's incorrect. My objection to ACA when passed was that it was a big giveaway to insurance companies. This bill is much, much worse.
They benefited from huge new pool of insureds. Are private companies not earning money from the ACA? Also, most pay something.
That's not socialism.
Insurance isn't socialism.
When a senator has no idea what socialism is, we're in a really bad place
If I'm understanding @JohnCornyn correctly, taxes = socialism. It's surprising to me that wasn't part of the AP Gov exam
No. Taxes = Theft
Funny how Socialism is bad unless it’s serves a certain group...i.e. tax cuts for the wealthy or corporate loopholes #cantwaitfor2020
Gimme the socialism
Federalism is a lie. 

It's piracy led by billionaires addicted to MORE.

Stupid empty words.  The right words are UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
Lip service to ill-advised campaign promises is neither Federalism nor Socialism but straight up bullshit at the expense of taxpayers
My Senators are quite the dynamic duo, eh America? Sadly John & Ted are addicted to Koch. We're talking freebasing Koch level addiction.#Sad
bs. you know those words mean something. why abuse them? meanwhile, you support killing people.
Today would be a good day to investigate @JohnCornyn.
Actually it's a socialist redistribution of wealth that benefits a small elite. You should have presented any better plan seven years ago.
The real question is why we are the ONLY country in the world that doesn't have Universal Healthcare it's called greed at the expense of ppl
What's it called when your administration is full of crooks & liars? Kleptocracy.

Federalism vs. Free Market solution, you dumb fucking hick.
What a depressingly simpleminded world view you have.
I just don't want to die because I can't afford healthcare. I hate that I'm crying right now. And you don't even care. What's wrong with you
I care. I hope you feel better soon! Coming to grips with the fact that ur going to die eventually no matter what care u have should help.
What are you on about now? This makes no sense.
Guarantee you this moron couldn't define federalism or socialism.
Healthcare is NOT a role of the Federal Govt nor is healthcare a right of the people. And no, not everyone will choose to get healthcare

1. "Federalism" is not a healthcare policy. It's an excuse not to have a healthcare policy.

14/ Also the GOP argument on giving flexibility to states was undercut by GOP not giving flexibility to states.

#MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
Our @will_c_fischer says #GrahamCassidy is just #TrumpCare with a new name and still takes health care away from thousands of #veterans. 
Because they don't line his pockets. He'll act like he cares then cut the hell out of vets' benefits. Duplicity runs rampant in GOP.

Try again Johnny.  GrahamCassidy will actually kill Americans.
This tweet alone demonstrates your confusion as to what the word "Socialism" means.
Like these federal ideas? Do you understand why Articles of Confederation failed? State's rights?
Pretty sure your base doesn't understand those terms.Might want to dumb it down a bit. How about Some healthcare vs. healthcare for all
You know that social security and Medicaid are socialized. You know this. Stop playing the fear card so disingenuously.
And look for GOP to gut both.
You can fool some of the ppl some of the time but not all the ppl all the time!
Ppl want AFFORDABLE top notch healthcare NOT access to mediocre healthcare coverage. Just more GOP word semantics. Still a POS bill recycled
You're mistaken. The Heritage Foundation's Romneycare is not socialist.
Oh fer chrissakes. Neither of you knows what you're talking about.  Both OK with taking insurance from 32 million people.
Obama Care is not socialism you tart
No John it’s for profit healthcare vs the right thing, we can’t have both, it doesn’t work sadly
EMPTY YOUR VOICEMAIL.
Labels over honest analysis and answers ... 

Graham-Cassidy allows insurers to NOT cover:
-Pregnancy
-Newborn care
-Mental health services…

1/ “Here’s the choice for America: socialism or federalism.” That’s what Lindsey Graham says in pushing Graham-Cassidy. But it’s crap.
Desired by the Koch Bros. (Graham-Cassidy) vs. not (ACA).


Hypocrisy/cruelty (Graham-Cassidy) vs. decency (ACA).

#GrahamCassidy cuts #Medicaid. 1,750,000 veterans covered by Medicaid. A vote for #GrahamCassidy is a vote to take healthcare from veterans.
Federalism and Socialism aren't contrasting at all.  How is my utility COOP challenging federalism?

If you too are disappointed in Sen @BillCassidy #GrahamCassidy let them know it - call (202) 224-3121 
4) If U care for the people you represent you will vote NO to this horrendous bill! #VOTENOGRAHAMCASSIDY
3) So the I can't afford healthcare will continue for all of us with cancer/heart disease/crohns/autism/etc because of this ignorant bill!
2) with pre-existing conds. This does NOT protect us! I voted for him cuz he said he would REPEAL Ocare & replace. This is worse then Ocare!
1) This is NOT REPEAL! It's a tweek. It hurts pre-existing cond patients. I have a letter from Trump stating he would protect those

Graham-Cassidy cuts Medicaid spending on kids by 31 percent, per new Avalere analysis. 
Koch whore vs senatorial representation. #worstsenatorinusa
As one of ur constituents, I thank u during this chaotic yr, but quit it with the socialism rhetoric - everyone deserves good healthcare
REPEAL was the DEAL!!!!!
So, Medicare and Veterans Benefits are next?
Take a civics class.
Take an English class.
Learn something. Like one thing. Once.
False narrative. True conservatism means waiting 4 full CBO score to see how #GrahamCassidy affects 1/5 of economy.
More like you won't get your pockets lined by wealthy donors if you don't get this done.
BullShit! John. Kochism vs Healthcare
Heartless vs. Compassion for the less fortunate among us.
Whatever makes the rich guys happy, right?
Maybe instead of tweeting nonsense you should listen to your voice mail messages from your constituents. #mailboxisfull
you really do have no idea what you're talking about do you ? buzzwords are not even well chosen. @txlege @All100Senators @dallasnews
ur DC office voicemail is full. Bet its NOT messages supporting Graham -Cassidy. vote as your constituent tell u. It's ur job!
Are you sure you know how to use #twitter?
Really #GrahamCassidy is a hybred.  Fed collects taxes, and makes regs, then gives responsibility to the states = Fed-socialism.
Socialism is bailing your state out right now.. idiot.
Just a flat out lie
Do the profitable insurance companies know they are supposed to be socialists?
Do y'all understand the American ppl do not want socialized medicine?? Probably not if i have it figured right.
I wanted to leave you a voicemail asking you to vote NO on Graham/Cassidy, but your mailbox is full. What a surprise.
The lack of compassion among the @GOP is staggering
Healthcare induced bankruptcy vs healthcare as a right
How is Texas losing $11.9B in Medicaid funding a win for federalism? Your take on this is simplistic garbage.
Wait I thought you were anti big government? Now all of a sudden you're a federalist? Do you even have a clue? #GrahamCassidy

Graham Cassidy is the most cruel and inhumane "healthcare"bill I have ever seen?
You sir, are a liar and not to be trusted. Why are you not getting that senile trumPutin out of office? Are you a traitor as well?
If you favor this bill, you're not pro life.
AARP is against the R bill. And AARPers vote.
And one works and the other never will.
I think PLUTOCRACY was the word you were looking for, @JohnCornyn.
shouldn't healthcare be for the people?! If not them, who?
Grandpa Cornyn way past due. He hasn't even read the bill. Time to repeal and replace corny!
If you get this passes your party will pay.
Or good vs evil.
No on Cassidy-Graham. #SaveACA
Neither! Get govt OUT of Healthcare, you eff it up. Free market, enforce fraud control, that's your job, period.
CBO score??
I call it idiocracy. Medicaid is the primary payer for over a million and climbing Nursing Home residents, what's the plan for them Senator?
Socialized medicine works great in Canada and Europe.
@JohnCornyn and the GOP seem to think we are not as capable as all of these other countries. This low opinion is unpatriotic and unwarranted
Bless your heart. Single payer's the way to go.

Trump adviser Moore on unfairness of the healthy subsidizing the sick: "people want insurance for their own families, not other peoples' "
Stop spreading propaganda! Using "bigly" words does not make you look smart. Vote No so that ppl can live. Pro life my ass. You work 4 us!!!
Which one's the one where pre-existing conditions are still covered?
Bro you're getting from both the left and the right 
It's actually cronyism vs cronyism. In Federalism the States don't have to come begging you for the money back. #FullRepeal
Here is the truth. 
http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/09/19/552044236/latest-gop-effort-to-replace-obamacare-could-end-health-care-for-millions …
No sir, this is partisan vs human. Or maybe rich vs poor. Or maybe dead vs alive.
@JohnCornyn is right. This is a step in the right direction. @SenateGOP should listen.

Even more of a reason to pass this. And reforming the tax code is important too. Glad to see the donors have the right idea.
Nicely done, a tweet proving you have the same intellectual chops as @realDonaldTrump .
Don't waste your time on @JohnCornyn.  These Rs might listen to reason:
I'm confused... Are you a backer of federalism or are you a proponent of state's rights? I assumed the latter
we want the wall......
Fascism
IDIOT!!!!
#Singlepayerbreedsbetterhumans
Hint:  Cornyn is FOR the one that kills cancer patients and preemies.
Federalism? The Soviet version of federalism, maybe...
Texas does a lousy job handling $ for those who need it. Underfunded schools, CPS, programs for the poor and elderly. GOP cares for none.

Bullshit

Under this bill, pregnancy will cost you an extra 17K. Metastatic cancer 172K. Autism 5K. Asthma 4K. This isn't a healthcare bill.
It's not Federalism, it is simply distributing federal funds to states in a different manner. States that benefit still getting federal $
Ideology will not cure sick people. Save the -isms and do the hard work of solving a complex problem. Vote no on #GrahamCassidy

The new GOP health care repeal guts protections for those with preexisting conditions. http://nym.ag/2xcm1V9 
http://j.mp/2fz9sJp .   Your buddy telling Sick Americans to just die. FK him
The idea that states should independently regulate healthcare in 2017 is anachronistic, at best.
John, do you support Farm and Oil subsidies?  Tell me how those are Socialism...
I dont think you know what Federalism means. This bill just screws over states WHILE giving more power to insurance co's to rob poor people
Not to mention a huge tax cuts to your rich friends
Disingenuous. Millions gained affordable care under ACA. Millions can't afford health care under G-C. Poorest, sickest lose most. Shameful.

Stunning

Katy Tur: there are no protections for essential health care benefits in Graham-Cassidy…
Those aren't two comparable ideologies. We have many socialists systems in America that serve us well. Stop using red scare rhetoric.
Why can't US have access to heathcare? You are hurting people. They're not talking points, they're humans. Be one!
Ugh. Just stop.
Again with three words. Wouldn't it be easier to meet with your constituents and have an actual conversation?
BTW, let's talk about what happened when the governor of MN believed the lie that Trumpcare was all about Federalism
BREAKING: Trump & ACA repeal is supposedly all about increased state flexibility. This is what happened when the governor of MN believed it. 

1. "Federalism" is not a healthcare policy. It's an excuse not to have a healthcare policy.
I don't think you know what those words mean. Also, you represent Texas! In what world do you imagine TX not ripping coverage from millions?
medievalism vs today
Feudalism vs democracy
federalism isnt prfect, neither is socialism, but combo is! Healthcare 4 all. Insurance cos./big pharma 2 greedy 2 b entrusted w/our health
Medicare is much more efficient for patient recovery and less expensive. Medicare must have power to negotiate pricing for provider svcs/Rxs
Why do u lie about your vote against Hurricane Sandy funding ?
graham/cassidy offers less $ 2 states 2 cover patients, punishes preexisting conditions/elderly & removes millions from healthcare, PERFECT
I'm embarrassed by both my Senators. So willing to pray for our state & help time of need i.e. Hurricane but when it comes to $, you're OUT.
Ignore the trolls.

Lol now republicans are federalists?  You're a funny dude...  this bill is not federalist as other commenters have stated... cute, real cute
You're done Cornyn, if you keep supporting this Traitor @realDonaldTrump
He's done either way I would hope. This isn't his first rodeo getting bucked off the bronco of common sense.  #TexasSenatorsLastTerm
Stop with the talking points. Tell the truth  I am so tired of bs from our highly paid reps
federalism is TX implementing health care on its own. Not taxed and forced the the Fed. Gov.
Don't be flippant.  If you live in a state that chooses to abandon EBs, pre-existing coverage, ban on caps, etc, you WILL be hurt by this.
ACA, § 1312:
Miss that "socialized medicine" under FEHBP, courtesy of your employer:
The  People?
#SinglePayer

(http://bit.ly/2hgfI8Y )
Federalism and socialism aren't in opposition to one another. It's federalism vs. centralization.  And the ACA isn't centralization.

John, taking money from taxpayers to redistribute to the States is NOT  the definition of Federalism in my Funk & Wagnalls
Obamacare isn’t socialism, far from it. Also federalism wouldn’t ban states from enacting single payer.

Oh, #WeReadIt. Section 106 allows states to waive underwriting req's. Insurers could charge through the roof for preexisting conditions. 
Is that how Treason Turtle dumbed it down for you? #SaveACA #ShameOnCornyn
Huh. I didn't know federalism meant we all pay fed taxes and then give it to other states to use for their own version of healthcare.
