You teamed up with a man that attacked your father and wife and you expect us the voter to trust you would defend us and join Cronyn? No...
By looking at your account you kinda seem just like a Ted cruz hater. ?
It is easy to hate Lyin Ted. He is useless.
What did he lie about ?
Anything that comes out of his mouth is a lie. He only cares about money.
You can't give any specific thing on what he lied about. So you're just lying yourself
http://www.politifact.com/personalities/ted-cruz/statements/byruling … here is an entire list of fact checked lies. 140 characters is not enough. Research b4 u call ppl liars.
Nothing there to see ! Bad link.
Is this like a town hall? Where you respectfully listen to dissenters and make real contact with constituents? One can only dream.
No, sadly it isn't.  We would pay to listen to them spew the moron's propaganda.  Then, answer ?s from strategically placed "supporters".
He's scared

Anyone you endorse has to be wrong for the country.
Ditch Mitch and Can Cornyn!
Sir, I am a big supporter, but it is time to get rid of obamacare.
Pay me first.  I'm broke.  I sent the max to Beto. Lol.

And u talked about New York values? POTUS has Alt-Right and Anti-American values. I guess you do too. SAD! Kiss the ring of your king.2018
Not with John Cornyn, he's a DEEPSTATE SWAMP RAT and lier.

Who would be best to replace Mitch McConnel?
Really looking forward to hearing some real-world solutions to healthcare problems in our country. Maybe you can hear some, too!
Why?
Pipe down about repeal & replace oh pompous and vain one;. Texans want ACA fixed
Why don't you have events that constituents don't have to pay to attend?
Do you have to by in Texas to sign up.?
Don't wait for hell to freeze over before this Congress will protect the Constitution of the United States 2018 https://www.betofortexas.com/ 
https://www.betofortexas.com/   Don't wait for the opportunity to repeal and replace the supporter of the Anti President.
2018 soon
A chance to see two of the worst in America working to destroy the country. Trump/party puppets. They should be begging for forgivenss
it's the only way constituents can see you in person
will you separate from this madman in WH ? If not why not ? 25th Amendment now. @txlege
I know Comrade Cruz you are a Breitbart quoting, Mercer paid shill, but somehow I still have hope for an "Honest John" Cornyn

Why we want you out
https://www.betofortexas.com/ 
hang on ... I have to pay $200 to meet my elected representatives? whoa.
Trump is unstable and must be checked. His rhetoric regarding NK  is irresponsible. Trump must be impeached before he gets us 
Into a war.
No thanks!
Only one thing is important, protect us from nuclear war,

Texas Republicans want rape survivors who seek abortions to pay more for their insurance because of course they do.

I would be more than happy to join you all in a mass resignation party.  Work for the people of Texas, not your special interests. #weasel
Retire to Cuba.
Mr. Liberty fighter? Where's your spine while POTUS is running amok with nukes? #useless
Вопрос к Теду ... Почему так много Ботов следуют за тобой? Я сделал это?
Ты такой храбрый парень, Тед.

Pay to meet your Senator !!! #DrainTheSwamp
The endless farewell tour goes on. #BetonBeto #Beto2018

Wait, we have to pay to get access to you? How about offices that answer the phones?  You two aren't listening...
Get back to Washington and stop @realDonaldTrump from starting a nuclear war!
I like you, a true conservative, but Cornyn is a swamp dweller.
No thanks
where are your open town halls, you two are hiding @MSNBC @indivisibletxjc @indtx36 @indivisibleATX



Have you thought about
Sorry, can't focus on this when you allow the maniac in the WH to continue pissing match with maniac in NK, both w/nukes. #ImpeachTrumpNow
What did you expect Trump to do in response to North Korea threatening to launch a nuclear strike at our West Coast?
Ted, you've been suspiciously quiet all year. Now you are teaming up with Cornyn, who bashed Rand Paul for wanting a stand-alone ACA repeal

Cornyn opposes The Wall - he thinks Texans don't want a physical structure
Beto Orourke = Reddit ask me anything, townhall, state touring meet n greet...and you?  2018= @BetoORourke
Oh man, you and Cornyn? What a sexy party it will be
How about you and Cornyn have some town halls around the state? Your constituents shouldn't have to pay anywhere from $50 -$200 to see you.

We the #majority of #Texans (the people you work for) would like to you to hold open #TownHalls so we can voice our opinions!!
We're sick & tired of YALL only representing your super wealthy #LOBBYIST!!! Listen to your constituents while your on your Aug break!!!
@Potus has 36% approval ratings #coattailstohell
Teddie, you know Texas sucks when it comes to It's citizens having health insurance, especially bad for the children
Cornyn and I, not me.

Why does this story keep changing? Why were there undisclosed G20 meetings with Putin? Why is this ok? #TrumpRussia
Watch the *countless* times Trump and his team denied any collusion or ties with Russia 
Do you believe our IC community or Putin #TrumpRussia #25thAmendmentNow #25thAmendment #TrumpRussiaCollusion #Resist
Putin: We didn't meddle, ask Trump.
Reporter: But WH hasn't released any info.
Putin laughs: We'll talk to the WH and tell them to fix that. 
Why does it look like VP wasnt briefed about the widespread Russian interference w our 2016 election? #TrumpRussia
FLASHBACK: Mike Pence January 2017.

Q: Did any Trump campaign member have contact with the Russians?…
#BetoForTexas #BetoForSenate #Beto2018 #TurnTexasBlue #boogergate
Only if you pledge to put Sen. Cornyn in a headlock & give him noogies until he promises a real Obamacare repeal effort.
Ted, if the Republican Leadership does not stop acting like Saboteurs, a disaster awaits them during the Mid-Terms!. Get your act together!
I get the feeling ted cruz hate'bates while looking at himself in the mirror.
Get away 33% decisions 2018
#douchefest!
When are you going to have an open #TownHall  & listen to your constituents?

FYI...it should Cornyn and I did you attend a Betsy DeVos school?
Ted's pretty lame and has accomplished nothing but raising his own profile, but me is correctly used as the direct object in his imperative.
They ain't the only ones speaking
"fake festival"
Ted Cruz you should do a live google hangouts session (Q&A) like Mike Lee did. And do them regularly
Every elected official should do this. There’s really no excuse.
Literally, would save millions in election stunts. Voters could reach out, feel connected, politicians held accountable for their actions
Downside though: they’d be held accountable and have to answer hard questions.
Of course...but the beauty of it is that we use their corruption against them. They would be forced to do it if it caught on. Both parties
Stand up to power TED before our Gov. is completely DECONSTRUCTED by the BREITBART TWINS.
He's helping them and benefitting...why would he stand up to them?
End the vacation and get to work! #DoNothingCongress
You should be directing that to McConnell.
Scared of town halls?
Scared of traveling?
Well, that made no sense.
