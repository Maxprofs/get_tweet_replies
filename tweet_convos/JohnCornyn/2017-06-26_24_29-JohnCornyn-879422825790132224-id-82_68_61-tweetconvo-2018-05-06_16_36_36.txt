@BCBSAssociation  is smart.
@BlueShieldCA is Going to be GONE! Good!
dropping them asap!
We're an independent member of BCBSA & cannot support this bill in its current state. See our CEO's statement here: http://bit.ly/2td2aCJ 
I certainly hope so! DO SOMETHING!
Amen to that!
P, you at least have some insight, but why can we have NHS like back home in england? Get rid if insurance co too.

A horrific metaphor for Trumpcare: this disabled woman literally being ripped from her wheelchair.

Bill Cassidy says he's undecided on Trumpcare, but he made a promise to this cancer mom. Don't let him forget it.…
What care? Obama care is done, I'm not paying 116 percent rise in premiums.

1/ I haven’t tweeted much about healthcare because it’s a painful subject for me. But it’s important, so let me tell you my story 
At what cost though? If you can't afford these choices, what good are they?
They bought our government. It is time to call them on it and go to single payer health care and do away with health insurance rip offs
Horrible man with a horrible plan. How much $$$ does it take senator?
Insurance companies care about money only. When people have to pay 12K deductible, they literally don't have insurance under Obama.
Funny, they were the first ones to deny me coverage when I tried to get insurance after the co my husband worked for went under.
@JohnCornyn Insurance provider happy, entire AMA not. Ok, got it.
I currently have Blue Cross Blue Shield.  As soon as I can change insurance, I will.
same girl
Then vote YES.  And get Ted Cruz to vote yes.
Figures Blue Cross and Blue Shield would come out and say that!! Highest cost insurance company!! CO-PAYS - both in  Dr. and scripts
How can you tell your healthcare coverage is bad? The insurance company likes it.
Of course they are.  It bails them out with taxpayer $
#Texas #MinimumWageEarners  #LowIncomeFamilies #SeniorCitizens WILL ALWAYS #VOTE #BCRA2017 DEStabilizes #TexasIncomeDisparity-A REAL #Crisis
Your incentives to stay covered continuously sound a lot like Obamacare, Johnny
Stay covered so the can scam us when we need it most.  No. Death is cheaper.  Sell your organs if you need money so bad.
So BCBS likes mandate & CSR (no surprise), 2 features of ACA. Also wants cost control, which is not addressed in BCRA or ACHA.
Obligations are one thing. But low income Americans often pay a considerable amount of taxes from wages...often at multiple jobs.
@JohnCornyn how you like that HORRIBLE CBO score for your terrible tax cuts for the wealthy...err health care bill
Blue Cross and Blue Shield are peditors. They love it because its raw meat and unlimited profit.
So. A part of the problem is happy with with the #StupidBill.
What if you were raped and need an abortion? What would my health care do for me?
So an insurance company that will receive a massive tax cut approves your bill? YUGE endorsement? GOP- harming people for political gain
Cool, more insurance companies like it. Just what we were all worried about
@JohnCornyn BCBS happy with this nightmare, thousands of Texans r telling you it's bad for us.  What's more important? Answer the phone!!
@JohnCornyn where does it say they are happy? That's reading a bit too much into the letter isn't it?
22M fewer insured so that a few 100 thousand can get a huge tax break?! Y'all are vile. FU Senator & eff the GOP. Ppl b4 profits. #cboscore
“…health insurance should be available to everyone and must be more affordable…”
CBO estimates 15 million people fewer people covered with insurance *in 2018*. That will be a fun election for Republicans. #DeathByGOP
Give the whole  U,S treasury to the Koch brothers get it over with
CBO: #Trumpcare will cover 22M fewer people #Obamacare by ‘26. Premiums will increase less but value of coverage will be lower.
What kick backs are they getting? What senators r in their back pocket

I see a lot of insurance companies applauding this. Any doctors’ associations? Nurses? Dentists? Anybody besides the skeezy bankers?
AMA says it violates doctors' duty to patients. So are we going to prefer insurance companies over doctors?
Somehow Europe and Canada have figured out how to provide health care to ALL  their citizens.
22 million more w/out insurance johnnyboy. Do you still think your bill is better?
I just got off the phone with my #TXACA silver plan representative, no waiting, all questions answered and I have a 5 new GP! #SaveMyTXACA
Don't keep pushing this undercover, white, all male, GOP tRump no care ! #ObamacareHelpedMe  #SaveMyTXACA
CBO: By 2026 an estimated 49 million people would be uninsured compared with 28 million who would lack insurance that year under current law
BCBS is a mega for profit company that has millionaire lobbyist that will pay to say whenever you want them to.
Says the for profit company who really has no interest in protecting the poor, the elderly, the sick, and children.
22M will lose insurance. But hey, whatever it takes to get that massive tax cut for the uberwealthy.  The real GOP mission.
Of course they do, they paid off all these Senators and don't want to cover people, I had them and they sucked!!!


People who can die from cancer:
- Dems
- Repubs
- Straights…
One perspective: insurer. Let's hear from folks w/other perspectives. Hold public hearings around the country. A bad bill makes a bad law.
Okay, so the insurance company getting a retroactive tax break is good with the idea? Yeah, I can see that. What's the AMA say?
This is an ins co. The ones you are catering to. The ones who paid you to increase their profits and decrease payouts, coverage, etc.

This is a succinct way to put it 
@tedcruz as a 60 year old Texan, in short, I'm not so happy that my premium could go up more than $7000 per year to pay for a bonus
In short, the CEO and executives will get hefty salary increases and bonus', what not to be happy about?
"there must be strong incentives so people stay continuously covered; and Medicaid must be adequately funded to protect our most vulnerable"
ACA already does all these things. and more.

In less than a week, I've received 2,034 phone calls opposing the Senate #Trumpcare bill. 

@SenateGOP: care to share your call numbers?
National Association of Medicaid Directors — comprised of Rs and Ds — says GOP’s Medicaid spending caps "are insufficient and unworkable."
And in short what are they not happy with?
Shock, biggest fans of GOP bill: insurance companies..
Are these not the same people who claimed ACA was sustainable & discounted the possibility of an ACA 'death spiral'? Not a great record.
So I should trust an insurance giant instead of AMA, who slams Trumpcare proposal. No, thank you.
Not surprising that those who get to charge more to do less for fewer people would be behind this bill; the AMA doesn’t feel the same.
2/3 of this is not what your bill does.
You better learn how to read Phil. That's not exactly what the BCBS Association said.
Oh, Johnny Boy -- focus on the FIRST and THIRD paragraphs, not just the second.
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
Must-watch. Beyond powerful.

Mike Phillips, who lives w/ spinal muscular atrophy, on what losing Medicaid benefits would mean for his care. 
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
It seems fitting that, with the #TrumpCare debate raging, I got this bill in the mail today from Ethan's most recent open heart surgery. 
So @keithcrc isn't this continuous coverage provision and individual mandate to have insurance?
