Shame on all of you.
is that where they are going to put trump when he is charged with treason? Seriously?
let's talk more about this in your next town hall meeting. when is it?
come talk to us about that here in Houston. We'll leave the light on for ya.
Keep in mind, you and other GOP are targets of a highly coordinated professional social media astroturf attack. #FakeAccounts
nope- we're real.Millions of angry patriots defending our country against Russia and the GOP.Happy Valentine's
Same talking points as all other sock puppet accts. Spend your time being interesting enough to get real followers. @JohnCornyn
thought you were fiscal hawks? The money we spend to maintain detainees there could be spent on our vets.
I'm a constituent from Dallas 75232. When will you stop ignoring us and hold a #TownHall? #AnswerThePhone
#AGREE
remember the good old days when GOP was mad as hell Obama never closed Gitmo! #townhall
or better yet why don't we put treason Flynn at Gitmo and water board him! You GOP could be onto something. #TownHall
Glad to hear y'all just keep making questionable decisions!
PS Town Hall to discuss?
but do your constituents? Why not find out with a #TownHall?
#AGREE
Monster! Black site prisons only serve to further radicalize. Start looking at root causes of radicalization instead of symptoms
please resign so we dont have to wait to fire you.
Hello constituent here! #DISAGREE
When was the last time you met with constituents?
I vote you to be the first quest, with your constituents asking the questions!!!!
how about the extreme position of supporting rule of law, and having GITMO folks face federal judges? That's a novel idea 4 GOP
Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia....NOTHING you do or say matters until you investigate RUSSIA
#AGREE
I feel like we should be looking into whether or not to toss half this administration into Gitmo since it looks like treason
And they like walls, so lets give them walls.
You need to hold a townhall and meet with constituents instead of brushing us off. and get on this Trump-Russian connection ASAP
#AGREE
how about maintaining and expanding healthcare?
town hall now.  Let's have a family chat about you selling us out.
tweeting this today instead of how u want Flynn/Russia investigation is bizarre. #uworkforus '20 will be here soon and u won't.
divisiveness  support of 45  hatred of immigrants  ignoring constituents  in 2020 you'll be  #anyonebut
please investigate trump's ties with Russia and I want to see his taxes.He is making the entire GOP look bad. #doYourJob #resist
shame shame  shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame  #impeachtrump  #resisttrump #resisttyranny
@POTUS "Supporting," "Aiding & Abetting." All getting kind of fuzzy 2 many of your constituents.
I'm more concerned that you aren't investigating RUSSIA and how they are meddling in our Sovereignty!  #Investigate
seriously? Please help your constituents understand why you side with terrorism and war crimes since we can't call you anymore..
Recommend to “sanity check” all policies & processes. War criminals to World Court? Not USA confinement?
Show us you really mean it when you call for an investigation into Flynn and Russian ties.  And 
Trump while you are at it.
#TownHall #TownHall #TownHall #TownHall #TownHall #TownHall #TownHall #TownHall #TownHall #TownHall #TownHall #TownHall
when are you going to investigate Russian involvement in our election and possible Trump connection.  Do your job!
Not in this country's interest. You know what is in its interest? Clean up the circus in the WH, and fast. Let's talk #TownHall
twitter game still on point. Now, how about doing your job? Texas constituents would LOVE a #TownHall
is inspiring and creating new terrorists worth your feeling tough?
so are you putting Flynn & Comey into Gitmo as the new form of terrorists in our govt?
so when Trump said he paid you a lot of $ on 1-19-17, what kind of work were you doing for him? Was it American or Russian $ ?
we Texans want to support you Senator. Please give us a reason to rally! Hear us!
because that's a pillar of democracy & freedom that we want to share with the world. 
does Trump got ahold of you by the pu... too? Your supposed to be there in service of Texas, not TO service Trump..
Is this tweet from a robot or are you seriously this disconnected?
you should send Trump to gitmo. Since he colluded with Russia to harm America.
gonna throw the traitors from the current administration in there?
Stop with your witch hunting. You may run into a mirror.
Well we need someplace to put you and your peers for dismantling our Democracy.
Town Hall!!
Let's send Michael Flynn for  committing treason and colluding with a murderous Russian dictator. Let's put him #InLikeFlynn
Nevermind that it's illegal and condemned by most of the sane world.
That's great! Now, where's my tax cut? You said you would cut my tax burden in half. Show me the money!
how about tackling treason?
Your blind loyalty is going to ruin the USA. Allowing Russia to run our politics. Shame on you. You are an embarrassment!
Why does the US need a detention center in Cuba? Except to circumvent Constitution.
This is a very poor choice.
Constituents to GOP senators. WE NEED TO TALK #TownHall The long distance relationship isn't working.
Yet another reason to never vote Republican in this lifetime. #ILoveUSConstitution
Absolutely not to "maintaining" or "expanding" Gitmo! Have you #LostYourMind? #WTF? #NO! #Wrong!
Your #TXConstituent certainly does not! Gitmo prison is an abomination of American ideals. #ILovetheUSConstitution why dont you?
GOP senators to Trump: We support your corruptive admin to the detriment of country & we will tweet like we are oblivious to it
town hall
a recruitment tool for terrorists--past war crimes--other methods are equally viable, or more so--and the rule of law-- close it
#Russia #IndependentProsecutor #TrumpTaxReturns
Your blind support of possible Traitor is very telling of your true character.
and apparently collusion with Russia.
We need to close Gitmo. America First means jobs here at home and the end to endless wars.
let's discuss at the town hall. Recess is coming up.
turn in your resignation please
#townhall
Not interested in investigating the WH Russian connections?
when is that town hall meeting?
that's great if the maintaining & expanding is 2 put @POTUS & all of his coconspirators there after the trial
#SendTrumptoGitmo
A #TownHall would be a great venue to discuss.
That means you also support expanding terrorism in the US since Gitmo has been a great recruiting tool for them.
omg I would hope that you are not part of this... You will not see reelection if you continue this type of hate mongering
Town hall, John. DeVos/albatross! Need to talk. Phones don't seem to work.
So you are supporting this recommendation, your name not listed. After watching Railway Man, I can't imagine how anyone could.
You need to be addressing SO many other pressing issues right now. Please do your job!
admitting to supporting the violation of geneva conventions on twitter......can we please get rid of you now instead of #2020?
Gitmo will be under water if you don't pay attention to anthropogenic global warming.
GOOD. 100% support from all except for Godless USA hating dUmocraP libtards. (Products of public education).
The GOP makes it patently obvious why the US is not a member of the International Criminal Court; they know they're criminal.
Y'all need to slow your roll. Quit acting like teenagers left home alone for the weekend with Dad's credit card.
black sites up next? Let's get back to discussing things that matter to a #texasvoter
senator Cornyn pls stop  attacking President Trump
John, why no town hall during recess next week? We want to see  independent commission investigate Trump/Russia.
I guess you will need somewhere to put Trump and Flynn
Hall of Fame?
Why would you do that? The Gitmo detention facility is a stain on our national character. We can be better than this.
of course you do. You supported this grossly illegal, extra-judicial prison from day 1, why change a dumb policy now right?
@POTUS Start by sending Flynn there!!! #OutLikeFlynn
