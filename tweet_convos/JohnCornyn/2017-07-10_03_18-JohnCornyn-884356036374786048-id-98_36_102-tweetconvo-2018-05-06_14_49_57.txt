You will tweet but you won't say anything in public. Stand up for us not Russia and call out this administration for Russian hacking.
Comrade John push Cong to fund more dementia studies especially in the WH. Trump and his pals seem to forget a lot of meetings with Russians
While at the same time our Traitor-In-Chief is cozying up to the Russians?  I doubt that. #ImpeachTrump
so what Comrade ? he didnt even get @IvankaTrump seat at G19 LOL, y'all are gonna get thrown under the bus in time ! @txlege @TXDemWomen 
Yes, we'll get tough with Russia.  During our joint cyber security sessions, they won't get 2 scoops of ice cream if they hack the Pentagon
https://twitter.com/RWPUSA/status/884427405603024899 … So... are you even American?
When a Russian agent calls to offer dirt on a political opponent, a loyal American will call the FBI.
Good! But aren't u concerned about our president making cyber deals with Russia?
Rexxon is backed up by the full power and authority of the President ... maybe, some days ... like the third Tues in months w/ even # days!


Someone from Russia told me Crimea belonged to Russia
unfortunately he is not president
trump   just let it go
John's ego has grown past his capabilities. Whether he runs or not depends on where the most $ is. He could be indicted and jail Trumpgate.
That is the first sensible thing we have heard from this administration.  Not surprisingly it came from Tillerson and not Trump.
Of course!
US says you are complicit and do not belong in office.  Where's your town hall?
What does your president say? What do you think about #TrumpRussia?
Having sanctions without enforcing them is like having a bathroom drawer full of unopened toothpaste and calling it dental hygeine.
Tillerson doesn't represent me. You do. Russian sanctions must be EXPANDED due to interference in our election.
https://twitter.com/RWPUSA/status/884427405603024899 … I'm not even sure Cornyn is an American, much less a loyal American.

Until 45 says drop the sanctions. No preconditions. You know Putin demanded that and Trump didn't say no.
Sanctions stay anyway
So I guess passing shitty healthcare bill that will kill Americans is no big deal; right?
GOP looking other way while administration colluded/colludes with Russia shows that you r all traitors to this country.

https://twitter.com/RWPUSA/status/884427405603024899 … When Jr. didn't call the FBI, and Trump didn't call the FBI.... they showed they are not loyal Americans.

You know what @realDonaldTrump did the same day Jr, Manafort, Kushner met the Russian? He sent his 1ST tweet about Hillary's "33,000 emails" 


Any sitting Senator not reacting to this is a traitor
russia was protecting a neighbor from being invaded like syria - stay out of their business #RepealNoReplace stop leaching off our country
Not going to happen. Trump does not have the guts. He is a coward.
Finally a stand on principle.
Yeah, but does Trump know? These are the same sanctions they have already tried to lift.
Tillerson says a lot of things then DJT says the opposite.
Collusion: VERIFIED. 

When are you calling DJT Jr to testify???? #TrumpRussia
This is BS reporting. Stop hiding from Texans! Either step up for our rights or get out of our business! Your self interests are obvious
Meanwhile, Trump asks Russians to help secure our next election while you fail to investigate how they did it so it can be prevented.
44 states won't give some voter info to panel @CNNPolitics http://cnn.it/2sGIlQp   Why would any voter information be released?
how long will you hear the lies, see the incompetence, and watch US get sold down the Volga. Dying out here for GOP backbone.
I don't trust anything Tillerson says
Another parrot tweet of a headline. Agree? Disagree? Any opinion? Trump lets you read the NY Times?
Now would be a great time for the GOP to speak out about campaign collusion with Russia. We're watching & we vote.
The fact Trump wanted you to head FBI combined w/ you pushing 'WE'RE BEING TOUGH ON RUSSIA' narrative has Texans mighty suspicious of you
trump believes putin over US intel. Russia is attacking us. EXPAND SANCTIONS.
#ImpeachTrump The longer he stays in office, the greater your complicity grows...and it's already yuge!!
Russia is attacking us. EXPAND SANCTIONS. trump takes putin side over US intel.
Russia is attacking US electronically. EXPAND SANCTIONS. Trump believes putin over US intel.
45 has other plans. Will you DO something about it or just tweet?
EXPAND SANCTIONS Russia hacked.Trump takes murderous freedom squashing communist dictators word over US intel.
I agree with @patelliottmba "Tillerson doesn't represent me. You do. Russian sanctions must be EXPANDED due to interference in our election"
Care to make a wager?
The sanctions were for meddling in our elections, not Ukraine!

Like that will ever happen!

Does it take a building to fall on you before you admit that something is hideously wrong with your leader? This is FAKE concern, senator.


So we forgot that Russia hacked...no sanctions stay...did bush say to bin Laden let forgot about 9/11 just be good
Your leader wants a joint cyber security task force
did you miss part where @DonaldJTrumpJr admitted to meeting with Russians to get damaging info on HRC? #25thAmendmentNow
Is that official policy or the flavor of the day?
Honey, just wait, it's still early. Trump will tweet a contradiction shortly. Tillerson will then bow and "clarify" his statement.
What rex says and what 45 does are usually at odds. You're a traitor, Cornyn. #TrumpRussia
Are you paying attention to the elephant in the room? This Russia connection is REAL and your duty is to pay attention.
Yes! The Russian connections between the Clintons and Podesta need to be investigated.  Enough of the BS Trump Russian collusion.
I don't trust tillerson.
Repeal #Obamacare
Thank God.  Let's see if for the first time Trump doesn't usurp him and do something else.  Stay on tweet watch!
in the words of g w bush "this is dome weird shit" !!!! get woth it cornyn

Q: Did any Trump campaign member have contact with the Russians?…
so you're filling your pockets over doing the right thing here?
.How much money did you get to betray your country?
How many secretary of states have received the Russian order of friendship?  I can only think of one....
@StateDept 
Hard 2 imagine a more inept administration.
Amateurs w/only criteria of wealth; not brains.
The sanctions need to stay regardless. Wtf kind of shit is this?

When was it decided sanctions weren't staying? Thought this was in the books. What did I miss? Or, what did they miss?
Illegitimate electoral college president AND administration need to be purged
Sanctions are about Crimea....they need to leave Crimea
Lmao so tou plan on ethnically cleansing 70% of Crimea to male Russians "leave"
Senator, Are you familiar with the term "covering your tracks?"
I think TRUMP has other ideas @MSNBC @indivisibletxjc @CNN @nytimes @CBSNews @ABCPolitics @NewsHour @SenFranken
Not an original one, to be sure
BCRA is still a dumpster fire.#DeathSpiral tax cut for the 1%, big pharma, and insurance co's. A few $M more for opioid won't change that
Including giving back the Crimea?
He doesn't need Ukraine now that you have helped give him America.
But the illegitimate electoral college president will still accept Ukraine donations
@JoeMSNBC @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @GOP @RepKevinBrady @POTUS @realDonaldTrump   Maybe Tillerson can get the Russians to quit meddling here!
You backed a crime family for President.
It's cute when you pretend that the administration has any intention of doing anything other than bending over for Russia.
