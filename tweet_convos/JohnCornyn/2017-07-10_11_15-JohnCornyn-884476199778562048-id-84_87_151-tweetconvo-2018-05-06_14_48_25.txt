@red Cruz and @johncornyn meet with their constituents all the time, only they are lobbyists and rich donors. There's no time for taxpayers
Cruz meets with normal Texan constituents (while he's in DC) every Tuesday.
No wall
Oh, I think @JohnCornyn believes the wall is a dumb idea. (As does anyone with an iota of sense.)
Keep reinforcing the idea.  With everything else going on, we need to focus.
Any sitting Senator not reacting to this is a traitor of our nation.
Did they tell you that they are not paying for the wall
How's that wall coming, John?
Geronimo Gutierrez? Now there's a man with some roots. Apache and Mexicans were bitter enemies if I recall.
REPEAL! REPEAL! REPEAL!!!
You will meet with anyone except your constituents. Bye bye Senator. #VoteThemOut
I need you to meet aith the rest of the Republican senators and repeal Obamacare. This week is not too soon.
Mr. Conryn did you discuss #SB4 and how it will impact mexicans living in our state of Texas?
#trumpcarekills

Medicaid pays for about 2/3rds of the 1.4 million elderly people in nursing homes. GOP health bill would slash it. http://bit.ly/2uf7bb0 
Twitter feed's awfully quiet today, Senator. To be fair, if I had crashed and burned as badly as you did with @FOXBUSINESS, I'd hide too.
Save the ACA. Every GOP bill and idea has stunk. Btw...those guys despise the colluding traitorous POTUS you run cover for.
Did you talk about the #wall that the head of the #Republican party wants to build?
How about repealing Ocare and tax reform instead of cozying up to the Mexicans. Will you ever put American's first?
Still won't have a Townhall with your constituents though.
Clearly U can't see Russia from your window, but Mexico + NAFTA are across the river. Too bad you haven't rejected the wall.
This Mexican assures you that enjoyment was not mutual. We detest your support of DJT. 77401 Constituent.
They have socialized medicine in Mexico ... do not take our health insurance! Medicare for all!
They wont pay for the wall.
Did you asked them if Mexico is  going to pay for #Trump's beautiful wall? Oh! with a door of course. 
http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/study-obamacare-not-collapsing-n781486 ….      Obamacare is not collapsing
Did you ask them for the money to build "the WALL"?

You have time to meet with bigwigs down in Mexico, but you can't spare one goddamned minute for your constituents in Texas.
traitor.
When will you meet with constituents? #NobanNowall
Did you call them illegals too? #darkmoneyGOP
What did they say about paying for the wall
Still awaiting your reply to my question...
Still don't hold town halls, though.
We all know you hate Mexicans
Did ya tell them they had to pay for a wall? Cuz that always helps relations with our allies.......
Are you trying to twist their arm into paying for the wall?

That's great but what about repealing Obamacare?  Only a 100% repeal will do!
Some of them, I assume, are good people.  That's just an assumption, since there would be no way to prove it one way or the other.
Surprised you didn't call ICE.
Avoiding the news today?
Since the solar-powered wall is a flop, how about making it the world's widest outdoor casino with slot machines from the Taj Mahal?
@JoeNBC @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @GOP @POTUS @realDonaldTrump   Did they offer to pay for your Master's Wall?
soooo, who's gonna pay for the wall?
Meet with your constituents?  Most Republican Senators are yellow bellied chickens
Did they drop off the check for the wall?
Oh, I feel sorry for them. We're you as big an incompetent aas as usual? #ShitgibbonsUnite
What's important is what was discussed. Enjoy or not enjoy is irrelevant.
Please tell them to take back their illegals. #buildthewall
He calls himself "the apprentice" or "the newbie" not qualified at all for his job. Please, do not think we as Mexicans are proud of him
They give you a big ol' check to start building that wall? Well that's odd. Trumpy promised they would & he's had 6 mos to deliver.

To be clear, Obamacare isn't failing. @realdonaldtrump is sabotaging it. 
Please tell us they had a check for the wall!
When are you going to meet with your constituents who put you in office.  I don't recall these guys being able to vote for you.
Did they agree to pay for Trump's folly of a wall?

Did you ask if they would be paying for the wall with a check or on a credit card*?
* - no Visa
Did they agree to pay for the wall?No?How come?I thought @realDonaldTrump was working for US @G20.It was just posturing. #cardboardpotus
My God, first the Russians and now the Mexicans
When is the next town hall? Read what Vicente Fox had to say recently? Will they start paying for the wall that your leader threatened?
@LVidegaray interesantes visitas, espero que denuncies las constantes humillaciones hacia nuestro país, y que no te quedes sordo
...letting go of khazarian mafia ties yet? 

help stop illegal activities in our government
you know what would be really cool is if you could have a town hall and meet with your constituents
#RepealNoReplace expose the pharma cartel and their experiments!

Well congrats to you and condolances to them.
Are u concerned that Donald Jr, Manafort and Jared all met with a Russian agent who said she had information on Hillary before the election?
