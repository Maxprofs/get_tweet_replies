All of these Democrats trying to "make a name" for themselves by opposing anything Trump tries to accomplish. It WILL backfire
They are being glaringly exposed for the hypocrites many of them are.
@DanScavin

Did you say hypocrite?
yes I did. No one really knew of HRC depth of corruption and poor judgement email server Benghazi in 2008. We do now.

plz provide the source for this information

you're the one that posted the first poorly-photoshopped clown picture. Can't handle it?
sessions failed to disclose oil interest and required. And his racist past is still his race this past.
wow had no idea session was a secret democrat !!!!!
he's not. But just because your nice with someone you work with does not take away their words or actions.
sounds like your man of experience!!! Remember the DNC racist name calling emails ??? Oh u forgot already
remember Trumps campaign team emails to Russians?

@CommonSense103 @DanScavino History has shown that John Lewis knows illegitimate when he sees it. Trump fan know the truth!

SHUT. UP. YOU. JERK.
@CoryBooker This is the hypocrisy and double standard that lost all those seat around the nation to REPs. Shame.
IMO, this is just partisan theater, so Booker can look good for his anti-Constitution buddies next time.
Playing to the base and fundraising. If he has to destroy someone’s character to do it, so be it I guess

Here is another contradiction of what he said today:
"I feel blessed & honored to have partnered w/ Senator Sessions in being the senate sponsors in this important award."

@DonaldJTrumpJr  Democratic  rhetoric ! Hillary played the, "Woman Card"
Booker , Lewis, and others, played the , "RACE Card" !

Cory Booker - just another two faced liberal.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Booker is what Americans hate about politics. Praising someone one day betraying them the next. #MAGA
@DonaldJTrumpJr he just lost all credibility. This will be played over and over when and if he runs for another office.
@robtdfischl My, my , my! How things change when answering the call of the Corrupt Democrat Party! Shameful!
If session becomes AG, Booker  better hope he doesn't screw-up.
With these progs, no good deed goes unpunished.

the beautty of the sound-bites to expose liberals.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Opportunist
@mjgranger1 Back-stabber just like bho is!
A study in hypocrisy

@DonaldJTrumpJr hypocrite

@DonaldJTrumpJr Just a political hack
Democrats are a class act making fools of themselves. They wonder why they lost!! Stop,Look and Listen!
@DonaldJTrumpJr  Never trust this dem politician.
@shirl47char Can We trust Him? You be the Judge!
@DonaldJTrumpJr this is just political play to set up a 2020 run. He is a clown and a fraud.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @CoryBooker is a lying hypocrite! Due the American people a favor don't bother to run in 2020! U will lose
@CoryBooker Hypocrite Booker.
@shirl47char He thought a lot of Sessions then!! I guess because Sessions had helped Him! I would be ashamed  to show my face!!
@DonaldJTrumpJr  honestly I remain baffled each and every day.  What are they thinking?  1/20/17. A day of a new beginning.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Booker is being an opportunist vying for attention so he can run in 2020 so stabbed His friend JS in the back
@DonaldJTrumpJr Funny he changed quick. From praising to condemning. Witch is Booker.
Hmmmm
So Booker which one is the truth??  Democrats next  best pick for President of the United States  2020??
@DonaldJTrumpJr The Blk Caucus twisted his arm. Now Booker is beholden to them. because he is ambitious.
This is the best Dems can do? Another loser in 2020. They'll never learn. Keep 'em coming!
What a puppet for George Soros and his minions. He is just trying to seek President Obama's seat and it is evident.
You can't "unhear" that Cory!
Stop being such a dimwit!!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Until I got the chance to stab him in the back.
That was before he realized THIS was his one and only shot at creating a name for himself. Shameful democrat!
Booker a perfect candidate to join the White Lasher. His NJ constituents must be impressed.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Booker is my self serving Senator looking to heighten his profile to run 4 POTUS. He improved Newark not at all!
What a joke he turned out to be. #PoliticalHack #SenCoryBooker Haha, good luck running for President. #PansyForTheLeft #MAGA
@DonaldJTrumpJr @SenatorBooker 
No need to be shocked.  @TheDemocrats  would sellout mom for political gain.  #BackStabber
@DonaldJTrumpJr wow if he wobbles now imagine what he trirs when it for him drectly bad actor
@DonaldJTrumpJr He's a liberal pawn.
@DonaldJTrumpJr 
Booker is two faced.
It was apparent this was nothing but a publicity stunt. He showed how easy it was for him to lie & slander an honorable man.
@DonaldJTrumpJr hmmm! What a difference a day makes!
No credibility here.  Booker needs to sit down and let serious adults run the show.
But, he wasn't running for President then, was he?
Choosing award recipients, you equate with attorney general?  Really.  If I said they were the same, what would you say?
@CoryBooker #MAGA #LoveLiberalsHate @SenatorSessions @realDonaldTrump
@JackPosobiec @CoryBooker will be the new "face" of @TheDemocrats Watch Obama USE him to further his destructive agenda.
so I'm a year things can't change what's your point
Mr Booker sounded inexperienced to me during his remarks
Though I understand he's a very compassionate person...
Well if he said anything against Sessions the entire KKK would have unleashed its wrath upon him
@coreybookermd is a liar, duplicitous, fork-tongued, bho wannabe...and that's the short list.
This is what a hypocrite looks like. #MAGA #Sessions
@bidinstructor Booker...ugh!
@bidinstructor @SenBookerOffice is a weak link and is not about America first ,but he for a select few who are not American.
He just wants to be top black cat ! He should be recalled for his dishonest remarks and a call to disobey law for blacks!!
Two faced hypocrite!!! Oh wait, sounds like most democrats!
He will be confirmed...trying to scare Sessions, So when he's in Offfice he'll tip toe around the issues..
@JLenardDetroit  When was that? Clearly b4 #DumbAss Booker steps up 2 testify against Sessions!!
#CoryBooker is trying to make a name for himself in the Swamp of Dirty Politics. What a jackass
That's backstabbing by any race.
@allabouttrump he's a phony and a fraud.
Poor Booker. He sold his soul so long ago he's forgotten he ever had one. Now transparent. Sad.
wants to be the next Obama! Screw his hypocrite ass. POS.
what an assistant is booker
