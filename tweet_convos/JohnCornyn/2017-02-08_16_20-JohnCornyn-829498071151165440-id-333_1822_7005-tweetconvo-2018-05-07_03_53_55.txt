A DARK DAY FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!!!
White power!
Best news we've had in a long while; AG's have been weak on LE last two Admins;
Outstanding!
Prayer answered.
- About time!!  Now we can get law & order back in the DOJ and FBI.
Lou, He is going to have to clean house at the DOJ as there will be many working against him just as Trump has in the White House
.@LouDobbs more shame for USA - people are saying 'let's hope #Sessions is a bit less racist than he was' - unbelievable @hrwollen_heidi
@lonelyvoice now arrest soros
That is essential! He is Public Enemy No. 1, when it comes to opposing #MAGA. Stop his anarchist thugs.
Yippee, Yippee, Hi Ho, Hi Ho, it's off to work he goes!!!  FINALLY!  Wish Congress and Dems would do the same--WORK that is.
He's a great man, Dimms need tarred and feathered for dragging him through the mud. This upside down world makes me sick.
Finally. Now he can start the investigation on George S and all the anarchist groups he funds.
Woooooohooooooo

If  bad dems keep destroy justice,God will help @SenatorSessions & @POTUS to deliver justice, because AMERICA IS WATCHING & AWAKE!
