These young people who burn our flag will NEVER understand what it means and stands for to us. They have NO IDEA what their missing 

OMG I love that !!! That's EXACTLY what should happen  stick these panty wastes right in the front lines...see how tough you are then !!
I know, right?!!   They are clueless about the sacrifices our military makes. 
Or how many, many lives have died defending it. I suppose they'd want to rid us if the statue at Iwo Jima too...if they could
They are pathetically ignorant & brainwashed because of compromised ed system. Lib teachers doing all they can to indoctrinate.
I totally agree...plus no more pledge of illegance ...no more history of what we've done (good & bad) to make us the nation we are..it's sad
They've done everything they can to tear USA down but then we elected Trump!We're getting our country back! 
There is even a guy there with a CNN hat , he will probably be fired for helping.
Thank you for all your support!
we want to help this Gold Star Brother. http://Americasmightywarriors.org 
That's awesome!
This just makes me come up. I bet this agent felt much the same, and honored to recover that flag
 Gimme a tissue boys. THAT'S THE STUFF REAL MEN ARE MADE OF. aww! BLESS YOUR HEARTS.
Beautiful.

Texas DPS rescued a man in Houston & went back for the American flag that belonged to his late brother, a pilot killed in action in WWII.

Why is that one guy wearing a CNN hat. Seriously is this staged and used an old man to push there #FakeNews.
Great Job, Thank You
Just Texans doing typical Texan things like saving fellow Texans.
Awesome story of commitment and courage. His return for the flag and his rescue both show the MAGA spirit.

Amen Carol

#Respect ó¾“¦
Hats off...incredible service and patriotism
Another heartwarming story!
Good job. Can't leave the colors behind.
The guy with the CNN hate will get fired for taking a picture with a US flag.
I love this!!!! 
"Salt of the earth" comes to mind.  God Bless America and God Bless Texas and Louisiana as they rebuild.
CNN hat??
Thanks so much for all your help.
My grandfather was a B24 navigator. Knowing you'll go back for such important items is what America is built on - the blood of patriots.
awwww... way nice!
If anyone needs me, I'll be weeping.
That's just stupid. Why risk the lives of rescuers for a relic?
God bless you all! 
#Heroes
Bless his Heart! 
,

Warms my heart....
Some real DPS officers I knew very well while living in Houston. Often talked about the Rothschilds and Rockerfellers. Never did get my hat.
Class act!
I love this.

This makes me proud of Texas, this hero & the sacrifices of our military & their gold  families.  God bless Texas & the USA!

@PolarWhut heartbreaking and heartwarming at same time

Made me cry....
A nation FULL of wonderful people , conservative and liberal , and all we get from MMS is hatred and negativity.
Hero's helping hero's!  #GodBlessTexas
Two world wars, to end all wars. And what does Europe do? Opens their border to Middle East while they export terrorism. Consequence?
They are taught to hate our country our flag in College! Indoctrination centers for marxist socialist ideologies
Thank you @TxDPS.
America love it or leave it. Yes! Love it. Especially when I see the great side of our Country as I see here.
They try their best to show we are divided but we are united as one! Under GOD.


Omg so awesome!!
Wow thank you DPS Special Agent !
WOW! Positive sorry after story coming out of Texas.
ANY true American would have done the same because we respect each other, we ALL bleed the same colors and we ALL have love in our hearts.

So very proud of you guys!! Thank you. God bless.
Thank You sirs!! You are true hero's and patriots!!
Hero doing something for a hero's brother!

Much better
The heartbreaking, heartwarming, miracles and stories that have & are taking place right now, break ordinary human hearts! God Bless Texas!!
So true. 
Young Americans, especially from the left, should learn real history that many lost their lives in WW2 fighting the real Nazism & fascism
Awesome
Wow!
I live in the greatest state, with the best people, a great governor in the greatest country in the world.
Texas at its best!!
At the same time, there are disgraces burning the same flag. Shame,shame I hope your employers learn your name. Employers! Ha ha. Silly me!

Heroes.
