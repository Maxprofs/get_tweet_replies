Nice now we know who to blame. #FireTedCruz2018 #StopPresidentBannon Answer your phone Senator.
.@JohnCornyn Happy birthday! As a gift to Texan children, please vote NO to Betsy DeVos, who would be disastrous for Texas education.
May I borrow those please?  This TX (R) would love to give congress a bop on the head for not having guts to stand strong.
FFS, as a fellow Trinity Grad, can you at least learn how to take a photo w/ your phone so it's not sideways? Also, #VoteNoDevos
@GOP is corrupt and will pay for their crimes.
beat your brains Trump stated on live CNN 1-19-17paid Cornyn $ & he had to work for it. You sold your soul
Why don't you grow a pair and start standing up to our fascist in chief?
wished you'd fight for America instead of crooked PARTY over country! Give the US a present and vote NO on Sessions and DeVos!
maybe now that those are off, you and @tedcruz can answer your phones. #Indivisible  #NoToDevos
do you guys even know how to use them? You need stand up to that Nazi that is laughing at you partisans. Your country is at risk
slip these on and knock down the @BetsyDeVos nomination. Signed, a dedicated Texan. #NotoDeVos
Please vote NO on DeVos. And please answer your phone.
Did you get my postcard?
Watch out. There's probably a knife stuck in it.
Happy birthday! Why don't you open your phonelines, so that your constituents might well you well?
How about answering your phones/email? You could even do your job and represent us. How about a Town Hall so we can speak?
Are you fighting for ALL Texans or against your constituents that think differently than you? Please vote no on Devos!
Thanks for battling Franken. Disgrace to attack @SenTedCruz
cmon dude. No one needs clubby when so much work needs to get done. Answer your phones. #noDevos #nobannononnsc stand up 2 trump
You'll need these - You've got a real fight now. Your vote should be #noDevos #ExpectUs #VoteCornynOut #RESISTANCE
better check them for anthrax before wearing. Be careful telling people that Cruze is a good friend. Cruze is a nut job.
vote no on devos
Why do you waste taxpayer money by even HAVING a phone IF you will NEVER answer it?
Answer your phone, Senator! We do NOT want DeVos!!
How about standing up for the country for a change, actual American PEOPLE, Senator. How about investigating treason in the WH?
he probably should have given you a dildo instead, more appropriate #NoBalls
please vote HELL no on DeVos!!
Happy birthday & vote #noDevos
Happy Birthday, now, please do NOT let DeVos in. Public schools r important,Financial aid is a real issue,& bears w/guns r not.

I am a constituent. Vote NO on DeVos. Fight Trump. Trump is no conservative.
Stay bare knuckle, John. Only a whuss uses those.
Mama gonna knock you out! Listen to you constituents
.@JohnCornyn UNSUBSCRIBE
Just a couple of #cowards masquerading as #Texans nothing to see here folks #Resist
well, a couple of cowards who hate each other #wehaveeyes
that is a very special present you guys must be very close happy birthday to you and many more
These are called "boxing gloves," Senator. Lol, nice gift between two guys who have probably never stepped foot in a ring.
happy birthday, Senator Cornyn!
@tedcruz should use them on yourselves so we have two less republican votes
Sessions and DeVos are WRONG! Please do what is right for us in #CorpusChristi and vote NO on their confirmations. Thank you.
what fight are you fighting? The one to deprive people of healthcare? The one to bring religion discrimination to our land?
you may need to take 'em off!
hmm.. as a constituent, not sure if I should be offended by this.
perhaps those gloves are a sign. You're suppose to fight to the kids of Texas and #DumpDevos. Happy birthday.

U both need to be reminded who U work for! DO Your JOB-fight for all Texans. Stand up to Trump! Quit rolling over like puppies!
you are leading the fight for barbecue---why don't you fight for Texans
barf
are you all back answering phones?
Nice Job @SenTedCruz   now both of you ...back to work. :)
Stand up to Trump just a little bit, don't give him everything.
So use them to defend education. Vote no on DeVos.
I

@PatrickSvitek Very cool!
wow.  Do you really think this is an appropriate post? Really? Each day you take it to a new low.  So disappointed 
No matter what the elitist in the teachers UNION say vote to improve education for all children Vote 4 @BetsyDeVos HappyBDay
Happy Birthday Senator
"The Fight"?  For what?  Being biggest sycophant?
@PatrickSvitek nice gloves. Since you have time for this, why don't you answer your phones?  We are your constituents. NO DEVOS
I'd take your vote against Betsy Devos for a Ground Hog Day present.
seems like u have time on ur hands. Answer your calls! Happy birthday. Now do what's right for Texas. #VoteNoDevos #ivote2018
you're going to need them. We are not giving up on our democracy we are going to fight you all till the bitter end .
@tedcruz @maddow 
Hang â€˜em on your basketball ring.
@jameshohmann I didn't know we had so many former boxers in the Senate. I was a jr middleweight.
I'm glad you two are getting along! Now go destroy the USA hating dUmocraPs.
Vote your conscience stand in support of students + #publicschools join bipartisan opposition & vote #NOonDeVos
.@JohnCornyn @SenTedCruz doesn't need boxing gloves since he pathetically rolled over for the guy who attacked his wife and father.
@tedcruz We the people ask you to fight for our kids and vote NO on DeVos.  Stand with those who elected you! #DumpDevos
is a coward! Stand up against Donald's swamp! NO ON DEVOS!!!
Will he be using FEHB or Goldman Sach's provider to heal his cuts and bruises.
Healthful wishes on your birthday. This native Texan demands you vote no on DeVos & stand up to Trump on NAFTA renegotiation.
@tedcruz Aww, cute. How about thoughts on the #ImmigrationOrder, your #constituentsmatter. #Refugees
... how about Betsy DeVos???
indeed, how about Betsy DeVos? #StopDeVos
We're going to take our party back from you two hacks. Texas forever. Kentucky never.
Nice gloves @JohnCornyn.  You have time to post this. That means you also have time to answer your constituent's phone calls.  #VoteNoDevos
Do you get to answer the phone as a present?  Nope, guess not.  Think they could get you a line other than the one to Mitch?
Proof that two wrongs don't make a right.
a birthday gift from an ideologue hack to an oil company shill. Wait until Trump punches our economy by messing up nafta.
think that'll have a little political repurcussions? Nahhh. Stay on that Trump train while he destroys our republic.
Happy Birthday, give the USA a NO vote on DeVos 
OMG could you be more out of touch with what is going on? Get out of your elitist bubble, we don't care about this. #NODEVOS
Good day on Judicial committee yesterday! Best I've seen you.....
@SenFranken wrecked @JohnCornyn, @SenTedCruz should have been at the committee to fight his own battle.
one coward standing up for another coward! @tedcruz When will stand up for #Texans? You could be a hero! Stand up to @POTUS!
Good one. I'm Texan too, SW OF FW. IMPEACH POTUS 
maybe they will inspire you to stick up to Trump
It's your birthday? Can you open the phonelines so constituents can call to sing and wish you well?
Happy bday. Please vote NO on DeVos. She is absolutely the wrong person to be in charge of America's education system. #4thekids
surprised he didn't give you a big dildo as reminder of himself !
They will go great with your KKK outfit.
