memo to Sen. Cornyn. Do your job and represent ALL of your constituents.
American children will only fall further behind if you don't vote #noDevos. Prove you can't be bought and stand up!
Memo to @JohnCornyn you represent all Texans, not just the republican ones.
@JohnGillespie76 @JohnCornyn not sure if he's representing Texas republicans. He's looking out for @JohnCornyn
That's why I'm of Jefferson's mindset: Don't trust any to office who aren't tied to the community
answer your phone!!! Clear your voicemail! Listen to your constituents!
Memo to @JohnCornyn : Listen to your constituents, you work for us! #NoOnDeVos
certainly doesn't look like Chuck needs to filibuster now - shaming all on his own!
Memo to John Cornyn:  Stop misleading and under-representing your constituents.  Country or party? #taxationworepresentation
Memo to YOU: NO to DeVos, Price, Mnuchin, Sessions AND Gorsuch.
Filibuster the hell outta him. @JohnCornyn knows it's a stolen seat. Can't wait to vote you out.
Your hypocrisy is astounding.
Who are you to tell Sen. Schumer what to do?? You folks were horrid toward Pres. Obama.
Memo to Corby--get some guts and stand up for us!
Memo to @JohnCornyn Put your country above your party as your constituents demand. Why didn't you support giving Judge Garland hearings?
shame on you if u vote for DeVos. Stand up for TX kids, not the party line. U work for us not the GOP.
he will filibuster whoever he wants. This is a democracy
Memo to John Cornyn: listen to your constituents. You know, the people who voted you in.
Memo to John Cronyn: seek medical help to remedy current bouts of amnesia. You repeatedly forget past actions..
Texans let's bombard his offices since he refuses to answer the phone for his constituents.
Memo to @JohnCornyn : Your constituents know you're a fraud.
Maybe you should vote for Garland first.  He deserved a vote.  Unprecedented act of neglect in not voting.
Obama won a landslide victory in 2008--Electoral College & popular vote, too!--y'all opposed every damn thing he did for 8 years
Memo to John Cornyn: and You, sir, I hope will lose your next election.
Resist this nomination with every means available!
Memo to Cornyn: vote to approve DeVos and you're toast in 2020. Check your Facebook feed.
Perhaps you should recall the complete stonewalling of Obamas nominee.
why not? Senate Republicans deserve it
Memo to you Gorsuch is a stolen nomination. Filibuster is a must!! @RealClearNews
Judge Garland...
.@JohnCornyn @RealClearNews still waiting for a confirmation hearing for Judge Garland.....
.@JohnCornyn Talk up Gorsuch's (&others) amazing record, professionalism. Promote his credentials continually. @J_Wade_Miller @NETarrantTea
seems hypocritical. Let's do the best for all instead of trying to beat each other up.
Filibuster Gorsuch.
doesn't care about TX. We will not forget this in 18.
You're a #traitor void of patriotic loyalty You betray #USA & your constituents to serve your corporate masters @JohnCornyn @RealClearNews

Memo to @JohnCornyn: Texans can't wait to vote you out in 2020 for consistently choosing party over country (and state). @RealClearNews
memo to Cornyn, listen to your Texas constituents
I no longer expect anything from R. senators except misdirection, meanness and mendacity; egotism, cowardice, and self-delusion
If You confirm Judge Gorsuch, he will always be considered an illegitimate SCOTUS. It should be Garland.
obstructing anything the GOP does. Is the elitist GOP above all of us?  NO
though it hurt your voters. Obstructing a consensus nominee for SCOTUS, Judge Garland. You have the NERVE to talk about anyone
- Absolutely hope Dems filibuster Gorsuch.
Also DeVos is a joke & an embarrassment to America. Your justification to her appointment is a bigger JOKE!
So hypocritical of you admonishing Dems when GOP refused to give nom Garrick his rightful hearing. It's lack of integrity.
Dems should filibuster Gorsuch! GOP was fine not confirming Gerrick.HYPOCRITE!
HEY SIR! I have been trying repeatedly to contact you using every method available to beg you to #dumpdevos



How about you give Merrick a chance? #PartofThieves #VoteGOPOut I was telling my friends to give u a chance.  You blew it.
293 days on Merrick Garland. Tell it to Mitch McConnell.
After stealing the nomination from the dems, this is absolutely laughable. How can you tweet this with a straight face?
memo to @JohnCornyn - R's should've given Garland at least the dignity of mtgs and a hearing. Pot meet kettle.
.@JohnCornyn memo to @SenSchumer PLEASE filibuster woman rights hater #Gorsuch! His mother was removed from gov't and he works against women
do as we say, not as we do.
It's obvious you don't care about all Texans.  I'm working daily with the FACTS to wake up the ones that think you support them.
The same chuck that lied about Harvard volunteering
Memo to Cornyn. We will use any and all tactics available. We will prevail
Cornyn, you suck at twitter.
Memo to John Cornyn: your constituents would like a town hall. What are your plans during the 2/20-2/24 recess?
Still no statement against Trump's moral equivalency between the US and Russia? You will crash and burn with him
That's a VERY small group of people; not impressive. Schumer is a Democrat and his supporters are YUGE in numbers.
it's a stolen seat. Vote on Merrick Garland.
Your hypocrisy is startling and shameful.
Why John? What about the real nominee the one you didn't even give a hearing to? Payback is a bitch
Hypocrite! Though I agree they shouldn't filibuster.  Should save fight for more important matters.
@TX21Indivisible @IndivisibleTeam memo to John Cornyn: townhall now. Texans want to chat. #standindivisible
merrick garland ftw.
: memo to John Cornyn. Your constituents are watching. You are not representing us. We will relieve you of your duties.
