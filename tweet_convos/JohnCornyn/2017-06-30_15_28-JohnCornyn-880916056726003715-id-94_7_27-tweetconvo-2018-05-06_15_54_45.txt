@govtrack Medicare isn't touched.Medicare isn't touched.Medicare isn't touched.Medicare isn't touched.Medicare isn't touched.Medicare ......
We had apologized and posted a correction for the typo (should have been Medicaid) before the senator retweeted us.
But Medicaid is pretty much scrapped. We still don't support this garbage bill! #texasconstituent

How can you LIE to people. People w disabilities and the elderly. ITS A 3 SECOND GOOGLE SEARCH. 26% cut by 2026. 35% cut by 2035. $800bill.
Go jump in the gulf.

hahahahaha, this Texas Gal is giggling up a storm; so apropos!!
Again, how can you continue to lie to us?
Address what IS touched, in person!  Medicaid, preexisting conditions, planned parenthood, tax cuts for rich...STOP DEFLECTING #trickyJohnny
Liar.
Stop lying John, everything is big in Texas including your lies...
Dual eligibles could be effected, Medicaid pays the premium right now, it isn't going to get cheaper
This is incorrect again. Read your own bill and add that to the other trillion dollar cut proposed by the Oval. Stop lying.
The actual link contradicts what you are saying.
Medicaid is & covers all HCBS. I depend on Medicaid for my life & liberty to live in the community instead of $$ nursing home. #savemedicaid
Lying has become second nature to you, hasn't it?
It shouldn't be everyone earning a check or collecting Soc Sec pays into it @PoliticalDiscor @indivisibletxjc @MSNBC @nytimes
Liar. You're as much of a liar as this President and act more and more like him everyday. Get ready to get fired. You no longer rep Texans.
You using the medicare trust fund to give the Koch brothers thre tax break
that's a lie. Why do you keep lying to us?
Greed of Politicians #saddenedcoenturist #SusanCollins #LisaMurkowski maybe you should listen to them
Bullshit

Shame on you! Don't give out Texans voter info ever!
You'll be lucky to reach Medicare age with our plan! #TrumpCare #TaxCutsForRichDicks

Ugh apologies the first tweet had a typo, should have read Medicaid.
what a liar   it will be touched and you know it
You are a liar. #shame #DoYourJob
Yeah, it's just Medicaid. So, no worries. Only the *poor* old people will die.
Cuts to Medicare growth figures?
GOP secrecy, rush to push BCRA thru despite the pleas & needs of Americans, and the president it supports = 0 GOP credibility.
Hope you and @SenToomey have a lovely evening. Will you be calling for room service or going out?
Read it
Medicaid is decimated. Those freeloading grandmas with Alzheimer's could get jobs at Starbucks.
You pretend you want the fed govt out of people's business, but you haven't said anything about this outrageous request for voter data.
I love how you keep saying something isn't so and just expecting that to become true. It's delusional. You're cutting Medicare and Medicaid.
Are you going to oppose these requests for voter data? Or are you ready to sell us all out completely? What happened to no big government?
Liar!!!! Stop lying!!! Trumpcare is a tax break for the rich.
Please share with us what the CBO got wrong, and how. Perfect topic for a town hall. How's August?
Usually Rs start wars to decrease the surplus population. Now, U can eliminate elderly, kids, start a war for the rest AND get richer too!!
Now you're just flat out lying, John. Or smoking crack. Or both. This isn't hard: reform healthcare without tax cuts for wealthy
Cornyn has $180,000 reasons to deceive.
Medicare isn't touched...yet. If Cornyn and GOP have their way they will come for it next.
Do you care what your constituents are saying on this topic?  What are they saying to you in response 2 ur tweets? Have u listened 2 calls?
As usual for you,John, MAYBE not entire truth. Some of the essential health benefits were extended to Medicare. No final bill yet written.
We've been Cornyned again & it hurts. Lies always hurt.
Stop giving easily disproven lies. No one trusts you anymore because of it and that's just sad.  We need honest representation.
It's really sleazy to use the distinction between Medicare and Medicaid like this, John.
Liar! What about the ACA's 1% tax on people making more than $250,000/year to help fund Medicare Part A?! Slated to be bankrupt by 2028!
Coming home for the 4th? How about a townhall  so you can hear how we really feel. You're overdue along with your colleague Cruz. A two-fer?
YOU ARE LYING TO YOUR Constituents STOP IT
Which you will give to the rich along with the Medicaid spending cut. I buy the CBO report before anything said by secret negotiators.
But Medicaid sure gets a haircut
Are you aware that folks that don't have access to health care before age 65, use more services and increase costs? It's complicated.
Perhaps some details would help put all the naysayers at ease? Do explain.
Who voted for you? Seriously. Come talk to the kids at my hospital about lifetime limits.
What's your rationale for killing 28,000 Americans per year with this bill? Is it eugenics? Is that what Koch et al. want? #TrumpCareKills
You're LYING
I want to keep my 82 year old mom as long as we can. Can you help yourself to leave her alone. She depends on Medicare/ Medicaid.
He acknowledges the typo in the chain.
That may be the case, but your Death Bill will hammer 59-64 year old's premiums. Will also kill 28,000 per year. #TrumpCareKills #GOPKills
Why do you keep lying to your constituents, John?
Now I wonder if you are ignorant or lying. Either way, you aren't acting like a re-electable candidate.
Let me guess. GovTrack is fake news too? Or just part of the Deep State (TM)?
WOW John,  straight up lying to us, your constituents. WTH is wrong with you that you are so intent on destroying america for points w trump
What about the repeal of Medicare surtax on high income wage earners.  Please represent all of your constituents, not just the 1%.
Nope but institutional Medicaid is - nursing homes. So nice to go after the elderly, kids & the poor.
John, you do you & just keep on lying. It only makes it easier for Texans to vote you out in '20
We don't believe you.
Think your cute John? I see what you did there. MediCARE, no you're gutting MediCAID. Why don't you ask DJT to protect us from Russia in 18?
You underestimate your constituents ability to think for themselves and to vote for someone other than you in the next election.
O.o 

You're a bold faced liar.  This is how dictators behave, not US senators.
Not really shocking from a man who refuses to pass common sense gun laws so children aren't slaughtered in their classrooms, tho.
Yeah, @SenToomey can't convince us of that either. Keep trying.
Why would you lie to your own constituents?
That's NOT good enough! DON'T touch Medicaid, CHIP or Planned Parenthood! #SaveMedicaid #SaveOurCare
Liar
Dishonesty is an impressive feature
lol he's technically right - they're gutting MedicAID, not MediCARE.
Nor is price inflation. Without control of that, it's like yanking the tablecloth off the table...even if you match population growth.
And you aren't a magician so I don't imagine the plates and glasses will remain standing and intact.
How about medicaid?
Your tax cut for the Rich is dispicable.

This is wild. The tax cuts 400 families get from the BCRA equals the Medicaid expansion for 700,000+ people. https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/26/15862002/tax-cuts-ahca-republican-health-plan …

Bryan. That looks crazy. Just quote the original. 
No way! It's your link!! Looks be damned! ;P
But you can't even read it!

And I didn't even say anything! 
But the tax cuts. Seriously? Strip out the tax cuts. #worstsenatorinusa
You're a liar.
Just in general, I mean. "Cornyn" is the new slang for "shameless liar" in Texas. Which you would know if you ever talked to any of us.
