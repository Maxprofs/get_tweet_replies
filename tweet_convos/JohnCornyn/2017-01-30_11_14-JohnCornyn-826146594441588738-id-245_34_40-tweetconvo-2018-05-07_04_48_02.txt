And they don't even know who it is: Senate Dems will filibuster Trump’s Supreme Court nominee http://politi.co/2jvyIiG 
Are you really so clueless or just hoping the gaslighting works?
@TXDemocrat @JohnCornyn S little of both.  He says earlier this year global warning wasn't real because it was cold outside.  Fool
@politico #mindlesshypocrisy
thanks for the Merrick garland vote #mindlessobstruction
@TXDemocrat 
#nutlesspols
Houston's water supply could be cleaner
Hypocrite. Cowardly, unamerican, partisan shill, pot calling the kettle black. This is EXACTLY what you did to Garland.
.@LadyBlueTX @TXDemocrat @JohnCornyn The hypocrisy of the GOP is unbelievable.
Tell that to Garland.  Hey, in TX we are building STRONG to get rid of you.  Thanks for helping out. (DeVos,Sessions, this)
@politico hey! You guys manage to block Obama's Supreme Court nominee! Both Dems and Republicans are hypocrites.
#mindlessobstruction great band name. Glad to see you guys back together.
I wonder where they got the idea to obstruct a Supreme Court nominee... 
<<== It is a constant source of embarrassment that this cretin represents MY state.
You're very embarrassing & will be gone in 2020! At you'll have 4 govt pensions instead of 3 then.
Your fake outrage is laughable. #mindlesshypocrite
@SenatorBurr him too? https://twitter.com/7im/status/826719871782240256 …
the other name for GOP is the shameless hypocritical party
like you obstructed the selection of the Supreme Court justice during the last 8 months.
@TXDemocrat @JohnCornyn Sen. are you oblivious to how hypocritical it is crying foul at this stage? Pathetic.
Wow, #mindlessobstruction?!? You have got to be kidding, do you think we don't know what you're doing? #resist #doublestandards
Cornyn & Cruz have been sucked into the murky, crooked world of tRump and Republicans. Will be a tough reelection.
Quid pro quo, sir.

You "represent" me in Congress. I am watching and waiting to vote.
Amen Brett. He is such a sellout.
@politico it is that moment when you realize that you are a hypocrite. #Garlandobstruction
@TXDemocrat @JohnCornyn @politico Yeah, that's helpful and productive.
.@JohnCornyn, you sir, are a hypocrite.  #Resign
That's not how you spell "Merrick Garland" but close enough for Texas GOP, I reckon
Merrick Garland. Memory that short? I'm a constituent and happy to discuss.
I am also a constituent and will happily join this discussion also. #MerrickGarland
#hypocrite much? Glad to see you are the same #whineylittlebitch you have always been. #stolenseat #republicanshame

the Republican party is #mindlessobstruction
@TXDemocrat @JohnCornyn Joe's right.  We want our state back.
Pot and the fucking kettle. To think I used to respect you.
WHAT? And that wasn't the MO of the PAST EIGHT YEARS?! Who writes your Twitter? Irony is so THICK on this feed I need waders.
@politico That's a play right from McConnell's book. Sound familiar?
@politico Hahaha not so nice when it happens to you huh? Merrick Garland was your bullshit party's idea and you still OBSTRUCTED
@politico i am ashamed that you're my senator.
@TXDemocrat Ditto. Can’t wait to vote him out.
Two words, Senator. Merrick Garland.
@TXDemocrat @JohnCornyn I have another two words... George Carlin taught them to me
@politico unless the pick is Merrick Garland, you'd better just sit and color Senator...
@TXDemocrat Come on. You republicans are no stranger to that.
#mindlessobstruction of Merrick Garland

#nutlesspols
@politico I live in Amarillo, Texas, and you are an embarrassment.

Why did the dems only need a simple majority, 51. And Republicans need 60? To stop a filibuster? McConnell?
@politico pot meet kettle.
@politico Doubds like a play out of the old GOP playbook. Must look familiar
As my dad and grandpa used to say, "Turnabout is fair play."  I'm a Republican, and so were they, but that point stands.

3. In 2015, Republican @JohnCornyn asked Sally Yates where her loyalties will lie. She says "to the people and constitution." 
.@JohnCornyn During Sally Yates' confirmation, you asked if she would stand up to the president in the name of justice. She did. Will you?
You mean like how you guys spent all year ignoring obama's pick who was a moderate?
@politico R U kidding me with this hypocrisy? Payback is a real @KellyannePolls, ain't it?
Pot, kettle, black. #mindlessobstruction
@politico crazy! I thought these guys were paid to rep constituents and Work WITH congress for sake of American people.
You, sir, are the expert at mindless obstruction. See: past 8 years. #NotmySenator
@politico Remember that time Republicans refused to vote on Obama's SCOTUS nominee for nearly a year? #mindlessobstruction
Wow I wonder what that sounds like? Where have I heard this story before? #MerrickGarland
@politico nuclear option NOW. Get some balls.
@politico your hypocrisy is showing.  Try to refresh your memory. #merrickgarland
#shamelessdelusion
#mindlessobstruction - Is that a description of Republican Senate tactics from 2009 to 2017?
@politico YOU LIE!!
Let's be serious: republicans set the bar pretty high for that. Democrats have big shoes to fill when it comes to obstructionism
but it was ok for you & GOP to do so? #mindlesshypocrisy
#knowyouarebutwhatami
Is it Merrick Garland by any chance????
what do you call the obstruction of Merrick Garland.  Be fair and call a spade a spade.  The D's are way out of line.
<<== #soullessHypocrite Can't remember he did the SAME THING less than a year ago #PureEvil
They learned it from you. Difference is, you had a good nominee to vote on, while Trump has a bent for picking the unqualified.
I am not mindless. I am your constituent. How insulting. Ppl are not in streets for no reason. Your voice mail is full. Fix it.
STAY THE COURSE, SIR!! STICK WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO IS WITH HIS CONSTITUENTS WHO IS THE MAJORITY OF THIS COUNTRY! THANK YOU!!!
Trump has ordered State not to talk to Congress. Do your job and #imoeachTrump
like you have any room to talk you spineless lemming.
every day I'm ashamed that Texas is stuck with two spineless, gutless, pretend Christians like yourself and @tedcruz
@politico Hypocrite. Repubs obstructed for yrs. Remember McConnell said they wouldn't vote for anyone hours after Scalia death??
@politico Unless you pushed to get a vote on Obama's nominee you have no standing to criticize. #mindlessobstruction indeed.
man, I guess it won't matter because y'all had a hearing and confirmed #merrickgarland right?
but I mean, they learned from Mitch so, why you mad?
@politico no, mindless obstruction is you putting money before constituents. #VoteNO
#mindlessobstruction describes the GOP congress 2009-2017. #NoMandate
@politico eat your crow
@senategop STOLE Obama's SCOTUS nominee. That is reason enough to block any nominee who is not moderate.
John, please stop trolling us and get back to work. Don't you have an ACA replacement to come up with or statement on Muslim ban
@politico wonder where they learned that from? Wasn't anyone the last president named blocked?
Said the kettle to the pot. Can we put the grown ups in charge now? Please!
.@JohnCornyn - LOL. Coming from you, that's truly rich. If you have so many opinions, maybe you can share yours on Trump's #MuslimBan
this is exactly what you guys did. Can't wait to try and vote you out. --TX resident
this describes what you & your comrades did to Obama and Merrick Garland. For a YEAR. This is the definition of hypocrisy.
@politico Really, Sir? Pot & kettle. What is your position on the #MuslimBan? Constituents waiting 4 u to reject it.
really?! Hello pot meet ketttle. R's obstructed for 8 yrs EVERYTHING including Judge Merrick. Hypocrisy at its best.
@politico I can't even. How do you not see the hypocrisy? I can't wait to vote you out of office!
.@JohnCornyn I assume that's a little ironic joke about Merrick Garland? Good one. Heh... mindless obstruction... I get it.
I suppose the irony of your comment is lost on would-be  Justice Merrick Garland.
Hmm. I'm trying to remember the last time a political party used this tactic. Hold on, it'll come to me...
@politico M E R R I C K  G A R L A N D
hey thanks for meeting with Merrick Garland and really, REALLY considering him for SCOTUS. That's a thing that happened, right?
Seriously, you are daring to call this senseless? You filibustered for ELEVEN MONTHS, you deserve it
I don't appreciate your hypocrisy on this
@politico "Kettle, you're black." The hypocrisy, it BURNS
yes!! It was mindless obstruction that the GOP blocked Obama & Merrick Garland for nearly a year! Glad you admit it!
It's what Repubs do best!
I don't understand the double standard, Senator. We are standing up for our rights and beliefs, not just being disagreeable.
Well isn't that just too damn bad? Merrick Garland ring a bell,Senator? I hope they filibuster every damn one for 4 yrs.
Watching you take orders from #Trump signified the end of our #Republic. You aren't fighting for #Texas anymore. This isn't #us.
#hypocrite how long has that supreme court seat been empty? Do you think we are stupid? -A constituent
.@JohnCornyn You mean, just like the GOP Senate did to the last administration? We see you, sir, and you have no integrity.
@politico mindless obstruction is exactly what the GOP did the past 8 years
Oh that's rich. The irony is lost on all of you ChristoFascists, isn't it? Remember 8 years of obstructing Obama? Payback.
LOL Merrick Garland anyone? 293 days your party putzed around. Let's not throw stones at glass houses, sir.
not mindless when past rhetoric+actual actions paint a consistently odious picture. 

BTW mindless: months of abdication by Rep
You still haven't figured it out yet have you? YOU made this "normal" Now they're going to be able to use every trick you did
You'd be the expert on that
"Honored to represent the great state of Texas in the US Senate." Really? Protect your constitution - do your job.
@politico you are a #chickenshit
How is this any different from what you & Mitch McConnell did?
@politico your Potus is in contempt of court he only deserves impeachment.
You really don't have any self-awareness at all, do you? *cough*MerrickGarland*cough*
Look in the mirror, you disgrace to America.
You should know.  You have spent the last 8 years perfecting it.
I think you misspelled #mindfulobstruction sir
Two words: Merrick Garland.
@politico this is on you every last one of you fascists
The suspected shooter in the Quebec City mosque attack is a self-described Trump and Le Pen fan. http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-mosque-shooting-suspect-to-appear-in-court-monday-afternoon …
This is your echo. And this one isn't mindless. This obstruction is what stands between us and total loss of rights. #NoPresidentBannon
huh.  Wonder where they learned that.
@politico #ironicallychallenged
And you and @SenateMajLdr had no idea who President Obama's pick was before you decided to block his. Hypocrite
such a hypocrite
answer your phones, I've spent most of the day trying to get through.
Wonderful..from YOU?? #Resistance #ImpeachTrump#ImpeachBannon
@politico This from someone who blocked Obama's pick. For a year. Not even a hearing for Garland. For a year.

@politico Just like Republican Congress during Obama Administration.
@politico Aka don't do what we did to you!
That sounds so familiar.
Why? Is Trump planning to nominate Merrick Garland? #SCOTUSnominee
@politico #hypocrisy
well, y'all did the same thing for about a year.
So that's only OK if you're a republican?
Cornyn is an expert on obstruction. #AmericasLeastAccomplishedSenator
What did you expect to happen. Guess who started it?
#betterthansilence #NoBanNoWall #doingwhatsright
And did you even give Merrick Garland a hearing?
hypocrite
Sir you keep comparing your politics to Democrats lately? To prove you're wrong or they're right? What's the message? #scotus
@politico Mindless obstruction was repubs the last 8 years. Defending democracy is now.
#mindlessobstruction Merrick Garland.
.@JohnCornyn MINDLESS OBSTRUCTION?! Your hypocrisy isn't surprising but is still revolting. GOP wrote the playbook on MINDLESS OBSTRUCTION.
#hypocriticalpieceofshit
Wasn't yours obstructionist?
uh.... Were you in a cave the past 8 years?
@politico Sean Spicer just stated that "The president has a right to have his nominees taken up."  You agree, Senator?
Agreed it's ridiculous.  But no more ridiculous than refusing to vote on any Obama pick because he "only" had a year left.
@politico Respond to your constituents, or it's you being obstructionist.
.@JohnCornyn get off twitter and answer your phone. your constituents want to ask you some questions.
@politico sounds similar to what you did all last year.
people seem to forget that Reid and Schumer said no SC picks in the last years of a Presidency. Reid said one, Schumer said 2
Why did you not vote for a  President Barack Obama SCOTUS nominee?    That was #mindlessobstruction
awwwww,Whiny Ass Titty Baby!  Remember, Gushing On Putin party comrade when you held of the Obama nom for the Gov Printing Ofc?
So what do you call what you did to Garland? Hypocrites...
@politico  well Democrats play politics as usual,we the real people are taking notes.
nothing to say about merrick garland's obstruction? That's mindless obstruction. You are such a hypocrite.
@politico and you guys promised to do the same thing to Hillary if she won. Just shut up already.
sounds familiar... #merrickgarland
@politico why?
@politico GOP were obstructionists for HOW many months? That nominee was Obama's to make.
the problem is that these guys are really old and losing their cognitive capabilities. Memory issues - time for old folks home
you are on record on this just as your GOP Brother is.
@politico Are you insane? "Mindless obstruction" is the game you Rs have been playing for 6 years. And you STILL have no plan
@politico    Really? I recall the GOP boasting about their effectively obstructing Obama while waving the flag.
like you guys did over SCOTUS for past year? Refusing to consider nominee from @BarackObama. You're a hypocrite and a scourge.
speaking of #mindlessdistraction you got a stance on the #MuslimBan? You're constituents are still waiting
you've got to be kidding me. #lookinthemirror
. @JohnCornyn Huh, I seem to recall certain people refusing to even hear the nominee last year. How times change. #karma
Does the judge's name start with M and end with errick Garland? If not, then your point is invalid. #mindlessobstruction
Like the refusal to consider Garland
#doYourJob sounds like You are upset Dem's following Rep playbook with Obama nominee, get over it!
They learned from the best! Hey, how's that investigation into Russian hacking going?
@politico The Dems learned well from Mitch Obstructionist McConnell.
You're a sick man
like the #mindlessobstruction the @SenateGOP @HouseGOP put up against Judge Merrick Garland? Your hypocrisy knows no bounds!
Yes, the #mindlessobstruction of Merrick Garland was pretty
childish.
