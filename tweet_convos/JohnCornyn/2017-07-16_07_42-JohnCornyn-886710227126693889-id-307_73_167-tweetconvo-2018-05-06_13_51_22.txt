That's great! Now what ever happened to the "Better dead than red" way of thinking??
Combatting an epidemic by gutting Medicaid, y'all are hypocrites.
What a joke!  Republicans are gutting Medicaid expansion which provided help and are offering this to get GOP mods back!

On another side note: I think you need to pull your head out and take a look as Trump is negotiating giving the Russian's compound back. ???
I smell Treason and you really need to do your job.
That is why they are working hard to take your money away from your health care programs & give it as a tax break to the wealthiest 5%.
You know how tx is paid for poor people? MEDICAID. I used to be a CDP that helped poor people get into tx.
Sometimes it would take them several attempts at tx before they got clean, others died. Not too many come back from heroin.
I could care less.
Stop using drugs!
Better healthcare for vets; we've EARNED
it
AF vet retired x4 deployments
Yea by trying to get rid of the ACA, which means no insurance- no treatment. I watch two die because they couldn't get treatment w/out ins.

It is past time y'all STOP messing with our money, lives and choices. #KeepThePromise #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom
Bullshit. How the White House and Republicans underestimated Obamacare repeal http://politi.co/2twUrvA  via @politico
That's wonderful and an important topic but I don't thinks it is reflective in your health bill - show me where it is...
#REPEALOBAMACARE completely as PROMISED!Or feel our wrath next election cycle! #FreeMarketOnly! NO trumpcare! #UnitedforFreedom!
Do u see politicians like @SenatorCollins works 4 unions & dem donors, she's a #fakerepublican
No, Republicans stand for small government and no regulations.  You are lying.
Coward GOP senators voted #RepealObamacare when the vote didn't matter. Act NOW 
#RepealObamacareNOW
 #RepealTaxes 
 #NoObamacareLite
What is so hard to understand?
8 years complaining.
Gave them Congress, WH.
Full repeal Obama care now
Fulfill campaign promises
Just give US our money back, we'll handle opioids @ the local level & do it better, too. Federal "help" costs too much! #limitedgovernment
FULL. REPEAL. GOP!!! What about that don't you understand? #UnitedForFreedom
How much money is the pharmaceutical companies contributing?
Drop in the bucket
@HouseGOP  Government Can't Fix Healthcare
CBO: Repeal would mean 32 million lose coverage, 18M in 2018 alone, would extend $230 billion in tax relief to the wealthiest
@GOP healthcare is dead again. Instead of writing bills to fatten billionaires, why not write them to benefit your taxpaying constituents?
Republicans had 7+ yrs to come up with a plan! So their plan kicks the poor, the old and the disabled!  Great plan rich guys.  Not buying it
In a rank political attempt to bring your wavering Republicans on board to screw health care for millions of others.
Liars GOP working for Russia over America
really? Fix the opioid problem by denying Americans access to healthcare that can prevent and treat addiction? #NotStupid #lies
Taking action? They are proposing cuts to what there is already. Misinformation meant for the uninformed.
Good cop bad cop
You should really learn how negotiations are done. Remember @realDonaldTrump is the one that dropped the MOAB not wimpy obama
Remember it was Obama that got Osama.
Actually it's was the Seals. But we shall give Omama credit.

BURN

When asked how the Senate #TrumpCare plan will affect her constituents, Sen @maziehirono says, "They're…
Our Reps start thinking they are as worldly, & hanging out w/ Globalist dictators who shame m for not being able to "control your people."
@JohnCornyn recently took hundreds of thousands of dollars from big pharma and the insurance industry
WHY, WHY.???? Must WE Americans PAY To Help The OPIOID ADDICTS.?? I Believed The Doctors and OPIOID Makers Should Pay For Their ADDICTION.!!
The correct way to slow down the opioid problem is to REGULATE big Pharma.Stop the CEOs from making profits off of pain, then selling NARCAN
@JohnCornyn @SenTedCruz @tedcruz
Top senate GOP leaders too no doubt, like Burr, McCain & Graham
Get those cats herded now!
Created by big Pharma. Pharmaceutical is taken from the word "Pharmakia" which means sorceries & witchcraft. Means Big Pharma is...
...Big sorceries & witchcraft! Big S&W kills approx 400k people annually in the USA. The Lord overthrow them & UR hypocrisies.
If you thought Obama care was a disaster... This is apocalyptic. The problem is the insurance industry.
It is time for the DOJ to prosecute users! @gop @SenateGOP keep your kids off drugs to fight the war on drugs! No users, no dealers!
This is a lie. The medicaid cuts will devastate access to health care and insufficient funds are being provided for opioid abuse.
I like it BUT! #RepealObamaCare out right !!!
REPEAL REPEAL REPEAL REPEAL REPEAL!!!!! Do what YOU PROMISED the American people!!!!!
How Much Donor Big Pharma $ Have You Already Taken For Helping Create This Problem, You NOW Say You CARE About?
SMH. How about making drug pushers (big pharma) financially responsible for the opioid crisis? I'm googling how much $ y'all get from them.
.@robportman You know this bill will decimate efforts to control opioid epidemic. Don't be bought off w/fraction of $$ needed
Every single tweet, sentence, word contradicts itself. You just can't make this stuff up.
Your 28% approval rating is following Christie's 
The GOP wakeup call has arrived
BLOOMBERG POLL - No.1 issue for Americans is healthcare -- and they give Trump low marks on it https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-17/americans-feel-good-about-the-economy-not-so-good-about-trump-j57v0var … 
When will you stop our traitor in chief?
Propaganda 101 by @SenateGOP -Sneaky attempt to lie to your constituents. Unlike 45's base, we're not all rubes.
The January decision to use the reconciliation process, shutting out Dems, and conduct no hearings, guaranteed a bad product. Start over.
NOPE you LIE
By cutting funds for treatment and ramping up the war on drugs?
Yeah that'll help
FIX THE ACA OR SINGLE PAYER OR YOUR HEALTHCARE FOR ALL. NO PAID BENEFITS FOR SENATE. .#TRAITORTRUMP CONSPIRATORS #REFORMATION GOP TRAITORS
Elderly chronic pain people still working! Physical work hurts!
Taking elderly off pain control makes the numbers look good? Never thought I would say this but, but keep the illegal drug coming in!
No we move care for the elderly ones who have been doing the shovel ready jobs, and the inherent diseases,arthritis, fibromyalgia ect, 65 ol
Your way is a rider in Healthcare bill that keeps Healthcare away from uninsured, women & poor.  U don't care u get tax credit. Pathetic.
The #Senate was cutting opioid $$ until some governors like Kasich and #Democrats stressed to voters wht effects H care bill wud have opioid
Former DEA deputy admits Congress helps fuel opioid crisis, protects Big Pharma
No you're not.
Well I am glad to see some money for opinoid addiction.
If you cancel the huge tax cut you could do more to help people with their healthc
I think you meant to say that you were forced to add this to try and bribe a few senators to vote yes for the very unpopular Trumpcare.
Now we just need to get them to take action on Russian intervention
Finally. After 50 years, finally. What a great bunch of guys.
Is your plan taking away Americans' insurance and not providing treatment?
False. Republicans are attempting to bribe their own into voting for a bill that 88% of Americans oppose. Who's getting paid? Billionaires
Supply and demand-stop demand to stop the supply. Opioids kill and if that is what they want they can die. Pee test Doctors/ State Workers
SEND THEM (GUILTY CONSPIRATORS) ALL PACKING!!!
Gee that's less than half what the ACA provides. Cheapskates & it's not even your money.
The only action GOP is taking is to take away healthcare from the poor, the sick, the elderly. 22 million people will lose healthcare.
@GOP is responsible for the opioid epidemic - #Pharma is in your back pocket!
by cutting access to health care by $800 billion? Nobody will even be able to get a broken bone set, let alone go through drug treatment!
The Q? to ask is:  Who are the suppliers of these Opioids?
Throwing $$$ at the opioid problem without a plan will be a giant waste of $$$.  Isnt this sort of govt action what the GOP rails against?
just in case u didn't know.2/3 of marajuana comes from Mexico.They are also a big supplier of coke and now grow poppy. Build the wall
REPEAL.
$45 billion not enough. Every reputable analysis says so, but you folks are into propaganda. Facts be damned.
No ACA Repeal.
It Works
 Pres VP & GOP stop sabotaging ACA.
Dumpy Corrupt Trumpy

You are not helping Texans by taking away healthcare for children.  Please represent us, not your rich donors.
There is no honor in the way you are about to abandon 22,000,000 of your fellow Americans with your "shameful" health plan
Liars!  You are taking away more opiod dollars with the gutting of medicaid.  http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/americas-heroin-epidemic/senate-health-care-bill-no-fix-opioid-epidemic-experts-say-n782721 …
Why does the amended BRCA exempt Senators from the bill? When are public hearings? Why drop pre-existing conditions?
@JohnCornyn by slashing funding for treatment?! By refusing use of medical marijuana as treatment option! What a bullshit claim!
Build the wall, stop the flow. Build one for Colorado and California if need be too
No they are not. Doing just the opposite. You know the truth stop lying
That's an out and out lie.
Yes like working to take away their healthcare!!
The govt is wasting healthcare money onunhealthy lifestyle
Drug abusers & ppl w/ promiscuous sex habits
Yet Christian counselors not allowed
We elected you fix the health care system not to make it to make it worse.  Where are you morals?
SOUNDS LIKE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE TO ME! YOU WON"T BE STUCK WITH TRUMP CARE, ONLY THE BEST FOR YOU SLEEZY LIARS!
Your values is a disarray, prioritizing horribly
Unhappy with the riches
Cause you're p*ss poor morally
REALLY? GOP CARES ONLY FOR THE 1%. ONLY LIES COME OUT OF ALL YOUR MOUTHS! WHY IS IT JOHN MCCAIN CAN GO THE MAYO CLINIC? CONGRESS GETS ALL!
#SaveACA #DeathCare
Yes they are eliminating healthcare for 20 million people
Yep, you're taking action all right. You're makin' it worse.
But screwing the poor, elderly, & middle-class. Each day brings a new round of blatant lies from @JohnCornyn @SecPriceMD @SenateMajLdr
By allocating 20% of the funds needed? Don't think so.
The president that you support Tweets, Watches TV all day or travels. Is that making America Great Again?
Please.  You've given $45b in the BHCA which is nowhere near enough. Stop patting yourself on the back.
So are you saying you would buy this crap for yourself Senators. You can get one of Cruz's water down versions. You don't need birth control
NO you're not
Republicans getting excellent healthcare paid for by Americans  they try to screw out of healthcare.

By devastating healthcare for Americans.  If your bill is so great why are you exempt?  Bet you won't comment...
By limiting Heath care in addiction and mental health services
Guys don't fool yourself, you're not fooling the average American  (ME)
@JohnCornyn Really by cutting coverage kind of mass backwards don't u think @indivisibletxjc @MSNBC @PoliticalDiscor @indtx36
mass to ass
As ususal your lying .Cutting Medicaid will make the opioid epidemic worse But your 1 precent donors need tax breaks
A pitiful drop in the bucket like the pitiful attempt with #BCRA. If it's so great, why did y'all exempt yourselves? VOTE NO!
You need to stop self-medicating and start telling the truth if you can figure out what that word means. 
HOW? When you're yanking the RUG out from under them all the damn time? LIAR!!! My God the bald-faced lies off you. 
By taking away coverage.  Their slogan should be "just say no, or die".
I know how you can do it!!! Sabotage healthcare for MILLIONS upon MILLIONS of people!!! Way to go GOP!!
Opiod addiction is the symptom. Why not go after the cause? The cause: open borders & corrupt Big Pharma.
By gutting Medicaid @JohnCornyn?
No shit Sherlock. They DIE when you take away their healthcare.
http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2017/07/16/sotu-collins-calls-for-review-of-kushner-clearance.cnn … Look someone in the @GOP has balls and, of course, it's a woman

Dispair = Opioid epidemic

Stop the lies @VP @POTUS
@lisamurkowski got $$$ for Kodiak to buy her vote
Yes, it’s the #TREASON Epidemic.

#GOP Loves #Treason.
#PartyOverCountry

Try legalizing cannabis. That would help with this and many other diseases.
Liar

45 billion????? What conservative about this GOP?????????
You're traitors too? Well that explains a lot
The ground of DC will tremble w/ the rhythm of our march
JustYouWait
What a freakin lie!
And of course, Cornyn RT this lie.
#NoMoreCornyn2018

The Constitution anticipates a President like this. It does not anticipate a Congress so indifferent to a President like this.
Get tRump out of the White House!

I'm going to say it - there is real evil in the epidemic rate of lying that is going on right now. This is not normal. https://twitter.com/vp/status/885946066075602944 …
Let the states handle it.  Not a Federal gov. Issue. Should not be part of a welfare program.  Opioids will not be solved with $.
#CCOT #MAGA
We are not impressed.  Get fed out of med.
#RepealObamacare
Let states & local communities help the addicts of all kinds.
You're gutting Medicaid to give a tax break to rich people. That won't help fix the opioid epidemic. Work with Dems.
