@JohnCornyn don't build the wall with money from taxpayers which is what an import tax will do. Find another way or #NoWall at all.
how about listening to the people you represent and tell us your position on Trump immigration executive order
Sessions should reopen the case on the female official who impeded conservative organizations
John's District: Voters should replace Senator Cornyn for not revealing stance on #MuslimBan esp since detainees at DFW
every new Trump appointment another #swampmonster. Tell us u reject the #MuslimBan.
Hey  @JohnCornyn https://twitter.com/funder/status/825918361410355200 … What are you going to do about Bannon?
Audio:Steve Bannon "We need to bitchslap the Republican Party" 
#trumpleaks #resist #impeachtrump #immigrationban https://soundcloud.com/nathaniel-meyersohn/steve-bannon …
as long as you're tweeting, we're ready for you denunciation of #MuslimBan. Stand up for Texans.
He is doing just fine.Texans are celebrating @POTUS choice!
I'm glad you feel represented, but legal immigrants with Texan born kids are being kept away. Stand for those Texans.
yes and my kids  are safe at the moment.  Give this a chance they will be vetted and cleared if their intentions are good
. @JohnCornyn I'm your constituent. Your phone lines in DC & N Texas are busy, vmail full. Sent a letter. SPEAK OUT against the #MuslimBan!
Whete do you stand on @POTUS making unelected and unvetted white nationalist Bannon as head of the NSC? #StopPresidentBannon
Why not abolish the IRS?
Nice of McConnell to point out that Trump can replace IRS commissioner with someone who will drop his audits. #Kleptocracy
that is all you have to say? Why not also comment on the great weather? Your Trump is a putting Americans at risk & u r silent.
DUMP SHOULDN'T EVEN BE THERE! TX IS NOT A STATE OF HATE! I will HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE OR WE WILL VOTE YOU OUT! #IMPEACHDUMPNOW!!!
Your silence is unacceptable. You approval of today's ban makes me embarrassed for my home state.
Where is our Senator from Texas denouncing this attack on our Constitution??
how can you be silent about the #muslimban, or the mosque burning in YOUR state? disgraceful placing party over human lives
Why not tweet about constituents protesting at #DfwAirport ? That would be great!! A response to hate?#TrumpBan #NoBanNoWall
- staffers are not answering your phone at your DC office.  Straight to your phony voicemail during business hours.
@JohnCornyn I know ur part of the Good Ole boys, but why don't u now start working to listen to ur constituents? If u do u might keep ur job
Could you in detail state YOUR position on this to Us, YOUR constituents without ambiguity? #DoYourJob
Sir, you and @tedcruz need t take a stance on the events of the day. The voters are watching.
@wisdomfromage it's head should have already been replaced. Cummings and Lerner both prosecuted.
He hasn't yet?
Stand up to Trump's illegal #MuslimBan or Texans will make sure you never again hold any elected office. Texas is watching you.
That can't happen soon enough.
SUPPORT PRES TRUMP ON IMMIGRATION BAN, NATIONAL SECURITY, THE WALL, PERIOD! NO GUTS NO GLORY! USA FIRST
Got a reason based on his job performance, rather than perceived partisan/party slights?

how bout you stand up to Trump?! Nothing from you. You and Sessions and Cruz are COWARDS! Ashamed of all of you.
I can't believe he has waited this long
this is your moment where you will be judged.  Your constituents demand to know where you stand in regards to supporting DJT.
your constituents are rallying together against #MuslimBan where do you stand? #NoBanNoWall
crickets
ASAP
he should also stop unconstitutional EOs which mysteriously protect areas of #EmolumentsClause violations
where do you stand on #MuslimBan? You owe your constituents some answers
coward.... that's what you have to tweet about?
Constituents NEVER ignored you doing elections. Why are you silent, not answer calls.Turn your back on ppl that gave you a job?

maybe you should worry bout have-nots more at this time
Trump should replace Steve Bannon. Far more harmful than IRS commish.
"Who is this famous pleader of whose name I was happily ignorant ten minutes ago?" Col. G. Stonehill @amshep
ok but where are you on the immigration ban/EO literally everybody else is talking about today?
What is your position on the #MuslimBan? Are you proud of your President this weekend?
Come on John, state a position on #MuslimBan
only American citizens have a right to enter the USA. Foreigners have no constitutional right to enter, period.
We want to know where you stand on what Trump is doing to destroy the U.S. You won't p/u your phone. You will NOT be reelected
I'm happy to give you my contact information so you know I'm a Texas resident. I need to know your stance on the immigration ban
Your silence on a much more important topic is troubling and disappointing #MuslimBan
Elephant in the room? #NoBanNoWall #nomuslimban
you shouldn't let trumps decisions represent you, unless you agree with him. #NoBanNoWall
you are soooo out of touch.
What is your response to the latest EO? These people are here LEGALLY? How are you representing their families- fellow Texans?
at this point where are you on anything?
Ask yourself what "national emergency" pretext Trump/Bannon will find -- or (cont) http://tl.gd/nndm5c 
I fully support the ban!
We will replace you. Remember we vote.
trump should be impeached.
Denounce the #MuslimBan. You work for us. Not for #traitortrump.
Seriously? U.S. (and TX) in tumult & you chose 2 tweet about the IRS? Wrong side of history! #PoliticallyToneDeaf #NoBanNoWall
what's your position on the immigration ban.
how dare you stay silent on the #MuslimBan . Say something, coward!
that will only make the IRS an instrument of retribution from our president
.@JohnCornyn THIS IS WHAT YOU FOCUS ON? While people lawfully fleeing war, Iraqis and Afghans who helped us are being detained!?!

Your constituents are speaking-r u listening? #airportprotests #texans against hate/racism: You can make a difference @SenTedCruz
THAT'S what you have to say today? You are failing your constituents and we will remember.
when are you going to comment on the #muslimban? Your silence is deafening
IRS ISSUE .POTUS SHOULD HANDLE IS TO RELEASE HIS LAST 10 YEARS OF TAXES.

Commissioner Koskinen should have been among the first to leave office on 1/20/17. Why is he still at IRS?
That should have happened on day one. Koskinen was impeached. What does it take to fire someone in DC?!
When are you going to speak out against the #MuslimBan? Or the #fuckingwall?
#votehimout #votehimout
Trump should replace himself and his entire staff.
your priorities r so messed up stop this #MuslimBan listen to the people you work for us remember that #votehimout @karenhunter
ummm, did you not see #iah and #dfw re: #MuslimBan. Seems the #Constitucion is a bit more important right now.  Priorities?
Would this have anything to do with Trump's taxes?

Also, when do we get to see them?
are blind to the developing constitutional crisis Trump is causing?
Expecting Rep to develop spines or remember principles we are told they stand for is in for a hard future.Empty suits.
Senator, you are being trolled by East/West cost liberals. But, you know that already. Keep Texas Great! And, I agree with you.
P.S. Do something about that George Soros guy. He has crossed the line again.
so the new commissioner can stop auditing donnies  taxes.
oh like the were really being audited. #alternatefacts
please address your silence on the immigration ban. As your constituent it is very important to me and my family.
Your constituents will remember your shameful silence about the Muslim/refugee ban
I am one of his constituents Very proud of Cornyn. Woukd ban you muslim- loving imbecile but I am stuck with you!
there is still room in VM boxes for regional offices.
I fully support the ban!
Your silence is very telling Senator. Speak out and stand up for the Texans you are supposed to represent! #NoBanNoWall
don't you have better things to focus on, sir? Your constituents ask you to speak up on #MuslimBan to know where you stand.
We're waiting for your stance on #MuslimBan. Your silence...well, it speaks volumes. A full encyclopedia set. And we can read.
there are about fifty more pressing issues right now regarding this Trump character. Perhaps you can pass that along to Mitch?
Are you gunning for this so new person can be sure audit of Trump taxes goes on forever? 
Trump has more pressing matters at the moment, like penning his resignation letter.
You have constituents marching at DFW and ATX and you have time to tweet about the IRS? Sounds like we need to get louder
@SenTedCruz @RepHensarling "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free...Send these...to me.."
Trump should release IRS tax returns. There I fixed it.
Will his replacement cause a protest against another unconscionable Trump decision?
Your silence on Trump's illegal, poorly vetted, anti-liberty law against Muslims is shameful.
Don't ya think he has enough replacing to do. Let's hold off a bit.
Sen trying to change the subject. Dt will be tied to th GOP forever. It will be ur definition and the definition of unAmerican.
I'm appalled that my Senator hasn't said one word about the #MuslimBan protest.  For heaven sake, Dallas DFW Jas protestors!
what are your thoughts about http://www.usatoday.com/story/news  I feel less safe in my own country. Please speak up I am truly scared.
Yes Senator, he absolutely needs to go, NOW! @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/316626-mcconnell-trump-should-replace-irs-commissioner …
The IRS should be done away with and a flat tax should be implemented!
Really? Our country is nearing a constitutional crises and that's what you tweet. Thanks for the slap in the face.
why is IRS commissioner not a appointee?
Especially when current one is impeached.  Need a full review of the ethics of the IRS.  Too much power to be unchecked.
yes.
Your priorities are screwed up, Cornyn!
