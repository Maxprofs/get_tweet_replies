WTF!?@JohnCornyn won't meet with public but wants money to continue Not doing his job? @SylvesterTurner @ArtAcevedo
You could have held a Town Hall in Houston.  You were with the Police Chief to protect you!!!
Many high capacity venues in Houston - pick one, schedule a date, and we'll be there. #TOWNHALL
cool it peppy g
u need to stop using pictures of kids as a profile pic if you're going to go around, making asinine comments.
Nice to see you in Houston. When exactly is your town hall so your voters can attend?
how about a town hall with your constituents.  Why are you afraid to face the people you represent?
Hey Chief @ArtAcevedo - We've been so impressed by you! But, did you happen to ask why @JohnCornyn refuses to meet with his constituency?!
Otherwise known as my old friend, the great photo op.
Mayor @SylvesterTurner you've got a lot of love & respect here in Ind. Heights. Could ask @JohnCornyn why he's hiding from his constituents?
stop the repeal of ACA and improve It!
, meet with your constituents instead of running around the state for photo ops.
if you can't face your constituents at town halls - You Shouldn't Be A Member of Congress!
Mr. Mayor- please talk the Senator in holding a meeting so people he represents can talk to him?
#cornynismissing
#townhall
Planning to see the people you work for? If I didn't report when my boss told me, I'd be #fired
Can't wait to vote you out of office. RINO.
sad you're so scared of your constituents. U work for dems too. UR ignoring us, trying 2 dismiss us
You know who would like to also be seen? Your constituents. When are you having a town hall in ATX?
we would like to see you too, buddy. Maybe at a Town Hall. - a Texas Voter
Why did you have time to meet with them but not consituents @JohnCornyn ?@SylvesterTurner @ArtAcevedo #TownHall #stophiding
--Art and Sylvester are doing a great job. You, not so much. Let's have a town hall. We'll be nice.
your constituents want to speak with you. You were in HTX and still no town hall? #texastownhalls
can you convince @JohnCornyn to meet with his constituents? Seems he's in Houston...Thanks!
Why aren't u holding a town hall n Htx? You've barred constituents from ur bldg, hold a town hall.
smart to get out of Austin
why aren't you holding a town hall?  Do you not care about constituents?
Awesome! When is the #TownHall ?
where's our town hall ?
How about a town hall instead of all these photo ops?  #DOYOURJOB #YOUWORKFORUS
no #townhall scheduled still. You owe your employers one. You work for us.
I hate the "HTX" crap. Houston doesn't need to imitate Austin ATX. #OriginalityMatters
And don't get me started on that new @Marriott Marquis downtown with the TX shaped pool. So lame.
but what about Russia?
I see you didn't bother to make any time to hear from Houston constituents.
Too bad you won't come see your constituents. @indivisibleATX
Sen Coryn looks so uncomfortable
lol. When are you coming out of hiding and deflecting.  Just like the boss, only going near friends who suck up to yo.  COWARD
, I admire two of these 3 men.
In Houston but no time to meet with your constituents? You work for us, remember??
Hidin John--Jesse James didn't hide out as good as you
come see your friends that pay your salary!
how about a town hall meeting  so we may express our feelings ! @JohnCornyn tends not to listen !
your constituency would like to see you at a town hall, John. It's almost like you don't like us.
- Meet with your constituents!
looks like you have two votes in your future
why is the house trying to stop the investigation between Trump and Russia
are you going to have a townhall?
this man doesn't care about voices,only money & pics.He could care less about a town hall or what his constituents have to say.
We're going to figure out a way(Conserve Dem or Moderate Repub) to  get someone to represent the vast middle of us Texans. Tired
of you not caring about us or our issues. You underestimate the breadth of the disquiet your disdain has engendered.
#TownHall
oh John, why so cowardly? Hold a town hall.
Glad you don't have time for voters.#DemocracyInAction #TownHall #coward #TrumpRussia
Great! Now how about meeting with your constituents? Remember us? We sure will be remembering you at next election.
why are you unwilling to meet with your constituents in Houston? 1 out of 5 Texans live here!
Town hall???
When will you have time to spend listening to your Houston constituents' concerns?
why not see your constituents, who you work for, while you're in town?
lol art didn't vote for u
Why won't you meet with constituents!
when are you going to meet with us your constituents!?
wouldn't it be good to see your constituents? The people you need to vote for you to keep office?
John, how about a #TownHall? Come on, we'll be gentle...
, can't wait for your #TownHall! When can your constituents expect it?
Interesting where you spend your time. Your constituents are wanting to speak with you!! #doyourjob
Since you're here, why not have a town hall? I'm sure @SylvesterTurner + @ArtAcevedo would agree. You represent all of us.
it would also be good to see your constituents, old & new. #TownHall.
when are you coming to west texas for a meeting?
not good to see your constituents, huh?  #townhall #coward
@TX21Indivisible Nice picture, but what about a town hall.  We want to talk.
So you were in Houston but couldn't find time for a town hall?  shame on you.
You do not deserve to call either your friends.  You need to fight Trump like they are.  #townhall
he won't see his Austin peeps either! Whatcha afraid of ???
Town hall?  @JohnCornyn we could have troubled you today, but we've respect for our law enforcement
Maybe you should have a town hall and visit us too? 78702 and not paid, Just Pissed.
.@SylvesterTurner @ArtAcevedo It'd be great to see you too @JohnCornyn! Why are you hiding from constitutes!?
.@JohnCornyn @SylvesterTurner @ArtAcevedo have you discussed defunding their city over immigration policies?? When's your town hall?
Illegal Aliens are NOT immigrants. The US welcomes immigrants.
immigration policy idiot. Read words before replying... immigration policy â‰  immigrants
Think carefully
