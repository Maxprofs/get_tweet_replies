Anything about Flynn, Manafort, Sessions etc retroactively correcting their filings? I looked but I don't see anything.  Make up your mind.
I'd also like to point out this is an Opinion piece
What about the pardon of a federal criminal

Reform Trump while you're at it and stop tweeting bs for browny points.
You have no shame.
Investigate Podesta!
Disaster hitting TX and Sen. Cornyn remains in hiding in DC. No open town halls in YEARS.
What's up with that John? Scared?
Awesome that means the Trumps should have this law too! Contrary to what people think we do want bipartisan  laws!
By pardoning Sheriff Arpaio, President Trump has once again made clear where he stands: on the side of racism and discrimination.
Like Flynn, Manafort, Kushner, Page, and the rest of the Administration did? Shouldn't @SenateMajLdr & @SpeakerRyan have to file for  $ ?
Did I miss your post about this?
Tone deaf timing here, John.
Work on repealing Citizens United...that's the real corrupter.
Yet Johnny boy is totally cool with @realDonaldTrump colluding with Russia, supporting Nazis and pardoning a Racist.
No proof with Trump, plenty of proof with Crooked Hillary
All these people are Seriously Crooked and when will Republican leaders Stand Together instead of being Cowards, Standing with President
Stop diverting. Deal w/Trump before he ruins every democratic institution. Arpaio pardon is outrage & dangerous to rule of law. Take a stand
Sure want to get this Podesta stuff under control. Never mind Trump's racism, bigotry, sexism, taxes, univ., Russia collusion. That's okay.
Are you kidding me? More partisan gaslighting. Stop, Senator. Please.
Tho John Podesta (HRC's campaign guy) founded the company with his brother in 1988, he doesn't appear to be personally involved in this.
Why, in addition to your #HurricanHarvey #posts, is THIS what you chose to comment on?  What are your thoughts on Arpaio, new ban, NK, etc?

Trump knows the walls are closing in on him & Russia collusion. His actions this week are acts of desperation. Ultimately, Congress must act

President Trump's pardon of Joe Arpaio is a presidential endorsement of racism. https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-comment-trump-pardon-joe-arpaio-0 …
https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/view/articles/2017-08-23/arpaio-pardon-would-show-contempt-for-constitution …
will it plug the holes for all the trump campaign Putin agents of only Hillary?
Republican leaders are Cowards letting Swamp tell them high to jump COWARDS and They Jump, Standing with President Trump and Country COWARDS
On your side of the isle as well?
Now she's trying to stay out of prison.
Need to do more to stop the false Trump/Russia hack Mueller investigation,
Where's your outrage on this?? Or is there a blind eye as its Trump not HRC?! #hypocrite
Are you waiting for your buddy McConnell to break with Trump first then? How much does Trump have on y'all? Because this is just stunning.
You have the wrong 2016 candidate in the photo, senator.
And the collision with Russia? The blatant racist in the WH? How about signing the Impeachment articles for abuse of power?

We see you, bless your heart.
Where was the outrage with Flynn? Ridiculous.
how about Flynn, Jared, Manafort and so on. you only remember Podesta? what a shameless person you should be.
Silly old senator.
Pass that bill
Ah yes, back to the emails. #CastroForTexas2020 #GOPisBadForPeople #YourPresidentIsAChump
Then I assume you will begin tweeting with respect to the refilling of Flynn and others on the Republican side?  Wrong is wrong.
Gtfoh.
Then make it happen, John. Grow a damn spine and stop protecting your friend Trump at any cost. DC is broken and your are part of problem.
Kinda like most of Trump's staff retro-updating security clearance forms.
No problem with that though, huh?
https://washingtonjournal.com/2017/08/04/new-report-reveals-mcconnell-ryan-took-millions-russian-oligarch-tied-putin/ … And this? What are you doing about this?
Or when former foreign lobbyists become members of a President's administration.
Make sure it's for all sides
So where was your outrage about Flynn, Manafort or Page?!?!  Spare us your bullshit
Will this affect disclosures by @WhiteHouse staff and Congress too? Do you hold the same criticism for Flynn and Kushner?
Desperate much?
Are you paying attention to what is occurring over about half of your state? Put aside the political bs to care for Texans.
Play to base screw everyone else .
Will your bill apply to Flynn? How about Bannon? And Kushner's multiple refilings? How about Trump???? #Hypocrite #VoteHimOut in 2020
my you are busy now that you are up for reelection, why weren't you this busy the last 7 years instead of voting cloture, obumercare ur falt
my brother says you were great when first elected, too bad I didn't see you then, I have no respect for you, think you a traitor like many
Why don't you reform Trump instead of being a party hack?
Too bad u don't care about th traitor in the WH.  That's bec he's an R.  But my question is when r u gonna have a townhall? Never?
Stop John. Your career is over. No one listens to you anymore. You cannot wash off the trump stench. You let us down. You are toast.
Get over yourself!  Why don't you concern yourself with Trump pardoning a racist criminal?  Got nothing to say about that?
Of course you act like "Podesta Group" is the problem. Your partisanship is disgusting. Party over country is your motto
What a shame. Anyway you can leave politics aside while our state is suffering a natural disaster ? Thanks in advance.
stop acting like you're actually going to do anything for this country
Will the president and all his relatives and cronies have to file? If so, bravo!

#CensureTrump
If @POTUS expresses views inimical to our values, Congress must speak out. I'm cosponsoring a censure resolution in wake of Charlottesville. 

We've been covering Joe Arpaio for more than 20 years. Here's a couple of things you should know about him... 1/many
Elected GOP officials remained silent.
#GorkaResigned #GOPsilent 
Putin likes Nazis. GOP officials like Gorka.
Christoph Hörstel, the leader of the German anti-Semitic party "Deutsche Mitte", visited Russia-annexed Crimea and met with Putin. 

.@HouseGOP - With Trump's record on #Nazis, answer this for your constituents: Would you vote for him at all, in any election, today?

.@SebGorka should never have been an advisor to @POTUS. He should still be investigated for concealing neo-nazi ties. https://twitter.com/SenatorDurbin/status/899737982944411649 …
Do something about the WH. Pardoning the corrupt sheriff should be the last straw. Is it?
#MAGAT

#RestInPower Heather Heyer, who gave her life today in defense of liberty and justice for all. We will not forget you. #Charlottesville 


"No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion..." 
Oh good. You're gonna go after Flynn, Manafort, Trumps, etc?
Is that what you're worried about?  You're a Texas joke who should resign, you're what is wrong with America.
*My?
You jump on this quickly but Putin and Trump invade our country and steal an election and you put a pause on that.  You republicans are sick
Maybe you could put some effort toward removing Putin's current employees from the White House. #ImpeachTrumpNow
Hi! ICYMI:  - perhaps you should focus on that instead. But I dunno - I'm just a constituent who thought America was pretty good already.
Didn't Manafort "forget" to register as a foreign agent after he was paid 17 million from a pro-Putin group?
Your selective promotion of events reminds me of an article someone posted a few days ago....

But the Trump regime can get away with anything and your turn your back. You had no care about Flynn
Cry more
You are a huge disappointment senator. Huge.
Any thoughts on Arpaio pardon?
Dons nut dripping off your chin
Party over country huh? How about the pardon you POS?
It should be too little too late. This corrupt bunch should be held accountable. My God, they get away with everything.
You're insane. Resign now. #CensureTrump #Censure  #HR496

Democratic Senators are asking DHS why the Trump administration repeatedly de-emphasizes domestic terror attacks.
