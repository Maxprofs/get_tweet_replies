so happy right now, over joyed praising the Lord with this man as SCOTUS. God Bless America! Love my Country!
Christianity needs to stay the FUCK out our our laws!
actually the country was founded on Christianity

Creator, sure, Jesus? Fuck that shit! We are meant to worship in freedom. Christianity is a plague..
Wash that nasty mouth of yours while you go read the bible, Your so rude to others
*you're
what was that suppose to mean lol
Great to hear, look forward to his hearing after Merrick Garland is rightfully seated.
That ship has sailed.  He is no longer a nominee.
Could be again, if Sen Dems willing 2 filibuster Gorsuch. Denying Garland 4 nearly a year wrong on every level
The filibuster won't work.  It can be broken with a rule change.
Point will be made. Seat was stolen. Also Sen Republicans will miss filibuster.
The seat was not stolen.  Stolen would lead one to believe it was his in the first place.  There is precedent.
Don't think there was any real precedent to deny nominee based solely on who nominated. Of course, there is NOW. #filibustergorsuch
@jensthoughts_j  Freedom of worship man "trump"
Justice Scalia's widow kept their "Trump 2016" yard sign up all year!
RETWEET if you're happy Trump chose Gorsuch!
no.
I am. Deal with it buddy
I'm not. Deal with it, buddy.
Trust me. I do enjoy watching you delicate snowflakes melt over everything! lol
we will all be melting when he removes climate change rules.
awesome! Can't wait for him to shut that shit down! Lies to part fools from our money
wow I bet you also think vaccines cause autism and the US was founded on Christianity
We hope!
well a commitment to the religious right at least!
Except for his fantasy Hobby Lobby decision not rooted in law.
@warfield_anni @POTUS Anni we got him!!!
@VP @POTUS right on
so great that the US now has an "ardent defender" of muslims, hindus, and wiccans.
@SCOTUSNGorsuch @POTUS Justice Gorsuch do you not remember the American people have been through 2 corrupt  AG. We need you.
does that defending religious liberty thing extend to not banning members of a certain religion? just curious ty!
I would rather he defend HUMAN freedoms, not the "rights" of particular religiouns
like unborn humans?
no, I'm talking about actual human beings.
unborn babies ARE human beings.
I assume you bury your goop every time you jerk off? Unborn humans, there, too.
So when does a fetus become a human being?  Curious where you draw the line.
birth, just like the medical professional
And yet the wraped, backwards/upside down thinking liberals will attack him and call him unfit. F all liberals.... @GorsuchFacts @POTUS
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Great man. Great for our country. Thx  @POTUS
@AltGorsuchFacts @POTUS HAPPY BIRTHDAY  YOUR HONOR
@VP @POTUS Something neither of you know anything about! #TrumpPuppet
I will not give up my rights to my own body, and you will NOT be permitted to take us back to the Dark Ages.#resist

@VP @POTUS halelulah
@VP @POTUS Awesome! Looking forward to know Judge Gorsuch better!
@badov49 @POTUS The Dems don't give a d#mn. Too busy playing partisan politics. GOP could nominate Solomon. Dems wld reject.
@VP @POTUS FYI: Antonin Scalia died Feb 13, 2016. Pres Obama nominated Merrick Garland March 16, 2016.
Welcome judge looking foward to a renewed spirit of JUSTICE  in our great land.
@SCOTUSNGorsuch @POTUS Conversations w opponents of Trump cannot be truthful & nice then pls say nothing & DO NO HARM  to OUR
Great choice! Smart & brilliant is what we need!
sounds almost as good as Garland.
So he would oppose your Muslim ban then correct #Fake45 #RadicalChristianTerrorists have been to blame for most attacks
@SCOTUSNGorsuch @POTUS I am disappointed & disheartened in you Justice Gorsuch for speaking in a derogatory manner about Trump
He prefers the puffy Cheetos, bucking convention.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS seems to be a GREAT pick. Just the judge we need!
#fuckyousocallptesident #kkk #hittlers #cocksuckers
@VP @POTUS @realDonaldTrump fulfillment of his campaign promise comes as no surprise but w/enormous promise for We The People
@WhiteHouse @POTUS isn't it a bit #odd to launch a twitter campaign for a #SCOTUSnominee ? Something seems #wrong here....
@WhiteHouse @POTUS make sure he follows God. Change , no more lifetime position. Make it TERM  LIMITS.
do you not understand church & state separation?!  Follow god.  Jesus Christ! 
that's what wrong with this world! Put God back at the top of everything you do!includesgovt!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS
The all out MSM Freakout will start as soon as he's done speaking #JusticeGorsuch #SCOTUS #SupremeCourt
On social media the crying started before he even finished speaking.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS now we know what the weekend protest is about
good for Republicans but not all Americans
@VP @POTUS don't care.  We'll fight until @potus is #impeached and a new president can choose the #scotusnominee
it will never happen, suck it up, gonna be a long 8 years for you.
Suck it up sweetheart, just like we did with clown Obama for 8 yrs.
don't call me sweetheart. I'm not that to you.  You may call me "sir" "flyboy80498" "Chris" or "snowflake"
you guys will regret it after the first year when he fucks everyone over. just wait.
I think thats backwards. You will vote for him after he fixes it all in 4 years. Till then deal with it.
no, I won't, because I don't vote for hateful people that ride on others people's fears.
@SCOTUSNGorsuch @POTUS Our Pres gave us best conservative Judge. Trump speaks what he believes.  We prefer truth over niceties
lol STERLING 
Pence lied for Flynn now he can't be trusted either CAUGHT ... Why why why ... 
@WhiteHouse @POTUS OMG I LOVE THESE #ALTERNATIVEFACTS ABOUT GORSUCH!
liberals you lost obama picked his 2 now our turn
One's religion of choice or Gorsuch's religion of choice?
how can I get the job to bill the wall I want that job info please
@SCOTUSNGorsuch @POTUS The people voted Pres.Trump  b/c it will take a man of Steel to forge through the Greed & Corruption
FUCK NO! Another white collar criminal! Like the rest of the criminal s i the WH
@shariclark1 @POTUS ~ I'm so proud to call Donald Trump my president!! His choices for his cabinet and now Judge is spot on!!
OMG you have to be kidding me, so you are for all the un-Constitutional orders & thoughts.
~ Exactly!! He has the qualities and integrity that I want in a Supreme Court Justice!
so he will be able to stand up to Trump on issues, uphold the constitution and the laws
yrs i believe he will
good luck and hope you can keep your small business, it will be very hard you
her business will become more profitable.only problem is ppl like u will have 2 find a job.be a good boy &set ur alarm clock
don't have set alarm I'm already successful now you might have to set the alarm Profitable I hope so you can pay the tax increase
@SCOTUSNGorsuch @POTUS Trump has had everything thrown at him.The rage over loss of power & $$ has  brought out the CRIMINALS
Great choice! Hope the Dems in Congress don't try to slow this confirmation! They are idiots anyway. Congrats Judge!
@SCOTUSNGorsuch @POTUS Trump has put together an impeccable cabinet he can't get passed to help him in these few weeks.
AND RIGHT  WING CRAZY ANTI WOMEN, ANTI UNION, ANTI EVERYONE BUT WHITE RICH MEN
GREAT AND ACHIEVED OUR LORD'S BLESSINGS.
#MerrickGarland
@VP @POTUS you mean like Merrill garland ?
Since you don't know Obama's nominee's name I am not putting any validity in your argument
@SCOTUSNGorsuch @POTUS Your path comes from a point of view of high laurels & lofty ideals.God has DJT on different road.
is this true? This is all factual right? Because it says facts beside your name.
@SCOTUSNGorsuch @POTUS Justice Gorsuch Pres.Trump picked  you & will most likely still support you even though you called his
Is blocking catizens legal @GorsuchFacts @POTUS
Do we really want a President who can't handle criticism to the point he blocked a cat on Twitter? #Trump2016 
YES WHEN ITS WARRANTED BECAUSE OF ROGUE DISRESPECTFUL AMERICANS YES!! NO1HAS TO PUTUP WITH HARRASSMENT
Suck it up Snowflake. Don't be a crybaby. (did I get it right?) @BitchestheCat
what does snowflake mean?
Apparently Trump supporters think it is an insult.  @harleygrl3465 @BitchestheCat
oh it sounded kind of nice. Snowflakes are pretty.
They are & unique & can cause avalanches when disturbed. I don't get it as an insult.  @harleygrl3465 @BitchestheCat
@WhiteHouse @POTUS GREAT PICK!! Super excited!!
What exactly are you so excited about?
Duh!! The fact that we got ANOTHER #SCOTUSnominee in the image of #Scalia ... #Constitution 
Great, another old white dude that wants 2 control woman's uterus'
@SCOTUSNGorsuch @POTUS comments:" demoralizing &disheartening" on 9th Circuit as Justices that legislate vs. interpret. Truth.
STOP SAYING TRUMP EARNED THE RIGHT TO APPOINT!  OBAMA/us EARNED THAT RIGHT A YEAR AGO. Trump has never EARNED anything
BUT WOMEN'S FREEDOM 2 CHOOSE - UR A HYPOCRITE MR "CHRISTIAN"...SHAME ON U - GOD IS WATCHING U -  RIGHT?
choose to kill another human is what you're worried about? Wow, innocent babies murdered is not a "choice"
didn't write PRO KILL THE BABIES.bless ur little heart/mind. ur a man.stay out of women's business
@SCOTUSNGorsuch @POTUS The man who became President through toil fire & arrows ONLY WITH THE GUIDANCE & GRACE OF GOD.
@SCOTUSNGorsuch @POTUS If the most diverse group of people in history VOTED 4 Trump to SAVE OUR COUNTRY CAN YOU AT LEAST IN
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Thanks for reminding me to unfollow you!! I wish you the same treatment that Garland received!!
good riddance!!! Hope many more follow you out the door!!
@VP How about a champion of personal liberty & equality - race, gender, sexual orientation
you already have the same rights as everyone. No one will take them away. Relax. God is in charge.
too bad he won't be a Supreme Court justice.
One way or other he will, remember the nuclear option? It can always be extended to scotus nominees
not in Merrick Garland's seat
Of course not! Because the Dems were in the minority! Apparently you need a civics lesson....
which is why obama nominated a moderate liked by members of both parties to Merrick Garland's seat.
Not a moderate! A moderate lib doesn't equal a bipartisan moderate. Especially when replacing
I'm muting you now, you're either a foreign troll or truly ignorant.
By !
@WhiteHouse @POTUS you mean #PresidentBanon chose him
The same way President Jarrett made his pick.
what do you base that on?
Were you not paying attention.  BHO was the puppet, Jarrett was the master.
But really my comment was to show how idiotic your comment was.  Mission accomplished.
not in the least but you go ahead and think so
So you thinking that of current POTUS is OK but my thinking it of previous isn't.   Typical liberal hypocrisy.
the real guy running the show is #bannon, #trump is his puppet & #putinspuppet
how would POTUS know since he's never read the constitution
WRONG
@SCOTUSNGorsuch @POTUS OURS &YOUR PRESIDENT THE MAN WHO HONORED YOU. ACT HONORABLE even if you can't think honorable about
defender of religious liberty , to all? I have a feeling the answers no.
WRONG
ok, how so? What are you going to say to change my opinion?
Ethically moribund. @GorsuchFacts @POTUS
How so? Please explain!
If you don't care about women's rights, how about draining the swamp.
#NeilGorsuch is a no on:

Abortion
LGBTQ+ rights/protections…
that's fantastic!!
you did a great job! Great pick! So proud of my president again!!!!
3 (a) But supports ban on Muslims.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS  Stolen Seat
Awesome!
Money is speech and corporations are people.
"Ardent defender of religious liberty"... as long as that religion is Christianity.
MORE PROPAGANDA FROM THE X RIGHT!!
everything that liberals hate. Confirm him asap.
good job sir
this seat was stolen by the GOP, it should have gone to @BarackObama's choice last year. sad.
sir I applaud your choice
ALTERNATIVE FACTS, which is to say LIES
Wall Street owns him, like all Republicans and most Democrats. More of #Trump's #DraintheSwamp lies.
bad dday vision. Bad dude. Good luck with that.
Great pick Mr. President Trump!! Thank you sir. Keep it coming sir.
@realDonaldTrump #POTUS #WeThePeople #DrainTheSwamp #LockHerUp #CommanderInChief #Flamingos4Trump #Breaking
he is a great man for justice
Jen Christianity formed our laws.
to note 3.  Does that mean he will lift your racist Muslim ban and let Christian have a priority?
Opinions are not facts.  Stop 'producing' the presidency.  shameful.
@VP @POTUS what's his excuse for denying  equal education for autistic children
ask him 2?  is the 2nd amendment a natural right?..  can a president be impeached for incompetence ?
Hey @mike_pence , The only religious freedom is freedom FROM religion. The other is called religious persecution.
Good job Mr. President. You are Making America Great Again.
is he giving you lessons on the constitution? You need them.
returning to the constitution!!!!!!!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS merrick garland
Religion should not even be mentioned! I've just about had it with these christian extremists and fundamentalists!
the putsch continues
He has the credentials, he went school for 40 years give him a chance...
Congratulations sir!
#MAGA 
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Religious liberty also means freedom to not have anyone's  religion forced on us.
Let see what reasons the Leftists drum up-besides being President Trump's nominee-to try to stifle the nomination.
When is Bannon getting fitted for his Darth Vader outfit. Dark side he is.
The last thing we need is another religious extremist pushing their beliefs on our country. This is tyranny.
Glad he was pick
Awesome pick.
in other words a racist misogynist. Got it.
Does he believe in the amendments? Because those are really important to the Constitution too. Civil rights and equality, etc.
Great choice
the us was founded on the notion of God, not Christianity. The founders knew that state and Church can't be same.
If he's going to follow the constitution to the letter, then here's hoping he knows what emoluments means, as Trump doesn't.
justice trivago fascist
Am I the only one upon seeing @GorsuchFacts flashes back to Sifl and Olly's ROCK FACTS ROCK FACTS ROCK FACTS?
stick to air guitar dude.
is he a judge or a so-called judge?
So proud of my country. I went 8 yrs being embarrassed and ashamed of the frauds in WH
@Blotus has chosen a #SCOTUS great let's start the filibuster!!yeah payback time @womensmarch @wiselatinaslink @UniteWomenOrg
Congratulations on the nomination.
and adoration of yours truly!
those of Islamic faith, as well! And he 'follows closely to statutory text and the Constitution's original meaning?" He
and yes God is the head of this nation and the entire world. Believe what you want but God placed Trump in office
flashback to when Obama selected Merrick Garland. Man this deja vu is crazy.
good job Mr President, We the people need strong and tough leaders in the white house. Good Job.......
and is a misogynist and a racist. Yeah. Excellent choice.
just fired a brilliant legal mind, sterling academic credentials, & a commitment to constitutional principles
your embarrassing president nutwack
praise God for President Trump!
And a dedication to upholding the rights of straight, white men. If you're a woman, better luck with the next nominee.
@clrson5 @POTUS I have a feeling that he is going to be great.
Remember when GOP said appointing SC justice wasn't right while campaigning? You've already put in your bid for 2020!
Excellent choice !!
lies

ARDENT FOLLOWER OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY FOR ALL? OUR PRESIDENT DOESN'T THINK THAT MUSLIMS SHOULD HAVE THAT RIGHT!
absolutely this man is brilliant no better choice
My bad Sir.  I knew it was the End of the World, so I left LA and started watching Anime's http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3756343/?ref_=nv_sr_2 …
I hope the Senate shows him the same respect as they showed Judge Garland.
@RyanGosling I had a Fracture in Venice Beach in California, by 8 black thugs.  1 vs 8.  That's how they fight in LA.
What merit does it have that he is like Scalia? We don't have to replace Scalia, and he was no brilliant mind either.
Facts don't contain such flowery language. #AlternativeFacs could, I guess.
Are just alternative facts.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS So shall we see  
unfortunately this man is illegitimate. This seat on the supreme Court rightfully belongs to Judge Garland. Resist!
Nah, this freak has outdated attitudes that are as old as the hills.
Hmm. This seems like a handle that might be slightly biased. Just a hunch.
praising God for this appointment.  Thank you for following the Constitution

He must never get involved with a case where the Clinton's are involved, or he could end up dead in a hotel room.
Christian law is no better than sharia law!
f.u.
Merrick Garland had a brilliant legal mind, sterling academic credentials and a commitment to constitutional principles
great choice
I hope Trump appoint another judge as soon as Gingsburg retires.
Dems worst nightmare
Mr.President, Media is corrupt, we all know this. why don't you support impartial and fair media like PBS news?
PRAYING FOR YOU TOO YOUR HONOR.
You can hope that the democrats don't treat him the way republicans did Obama's pick, but I wouldn't count on it.
@Rockprincess818 @POTUS Pelosi already whining about pick. These Democrats whine,boycot demonstrate & riot like Marxists .
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;"
LOVE HIM!
@POTUSust fine with millionaires donated LARGE sums of money. I'm not.
Congratulation to nominee Mr. Neil Gorsuch. Americans approves! Thanks to POTUS for keeping his promise to us. #MAGA 
@WhiteHouse @POTUS 
Left hated Scalia they will hate Gorsuch
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Away w/your #alternativefacts. He sets rulings based on personal bias against women, LGBTQ, non-Christians.
I expect nothing less from the new POTUS! 
# real leadership 2017
