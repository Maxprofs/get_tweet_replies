Smart move mayor. You must have figured out that you will be voted out so now you are trying to save your PUBLIC SERVANT position
laws for made for a reason inter blately disobey is wrong
I would hope the other mayors will do the same
Maybe big bird Deblasio will learn what's right

That is amazing. Finally someone that adheres to the law. US first.
and the collapse begins
GREAT
Yes

1 down 6 to go
looks like trump loves American consumer money to pay for wall
works for me if we weren't lied to
especially to build a wall in areas which are already difficult to cross...(sup guys)
oh yeah and maintenance costs.  If he were serious & not pandering, he would use other ways.
smart man, keep CA money
I'm glad I voted for you mayor Jimenez
SMART  MAN  YOU GONNA GET PAYED !
hats the way it sold be
No only an immigrant but most likely a former refugee fleeing Cuba looking for a better future 4 his family!
excellent
Indeed a wise man who's sights are on #Americans not #illegals.
Take a lesson #EricGarcetti & #ChiefCharlieBeck
$ talks lib BS walks
We applaud this Mayor for complying with Fed law. Sounds bizarre to say.
Another win for MY President!! And tax payers
kissing ass! (Excuse my language!). He is an immigrant himself!
while this is going on in Miami, lets not let this news cover up the fact that FSU has beaten the Canes 7x in a row
Great News

The Houston mayor refused to really say
The first to bow to federal law! More will follow
Knows what the Fed Law is and will enforce
Cities will comply with US Immigration Law when they know there's muscle behind it! (and a strong POTUS)
God bless you Mr Mayor!
NICE JOB MIAMI!!!  It's good to be first...
The Trump Train... rolling through a sanctuary city near you. Hop on board or get run over its going to happen!
Funny how fast the mind changes with lack of funds. #SanctuaryShowdown
#MAGA!!
STRAIGHT OUT COWARD OF AN AMERICAN POLITICIAN

it's also the smart ones see the change in voter attitude. Some polls (accurate or not)indicate majority oppose "SANTUARY" actions
thank you I live in Florida
The jig is definitely up.  Liberals are starting to realize.  SWAT action in Oregon helped.
1. Its the law and  2nd he knew he was going to loose a lot of   
This mayor said something very different the night before (in Spanish)

He must have felt it since he couldn't hear it.

@coolrager @FoxNewsInsider THAT'S the way you do it!

I personally think that the crooked press and we all know who they are should be replaced by the cartoon channel I like it
cuck
@MayorGimenez is smart to cooperate with @POTUS in effort to end sanctuary cities. @coralbabe2
Time to vote his ass out !!
he's afraid of little hands?  Wow... welcome to Nazi America

me, and my neighbors have to follow laws or else pay the price, glad to see others do too.

The McCarran-Walter Act, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 allows for the "suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions.
RT WAY TO GO !!!
Awesome job, Trump!!!

Others will follow his lead, it is the right thing to keep people safe.
He figured out that it would better overall for the people of his city.
