Lol guess the Maddow show moved FEMAS butts
Many will never give FEMA credit for its outstanding and lifesaving responses to Puerto Rico. I do!!
They have done/are doing a phenomenal job in the most unforgiving of circumstances. Decimated island, isolated communities,  fried _>
Where??? How come barely anyone has seen FEMA???
I seen a live video of them all inside a resort drinking g gambling eating hot meal and they get to shower
#FEMA @fema 
PLEASE BRING DRINKING WATER TO #LEVITTOWN #PUERTORICO
#FOOD #HELP
Y la del COTO LAUREL en Ponce donde esta
Until you heed the pleas of the San Juan mayor, you are a sack of shit.
#PuertoRico NEEDS more help. Pence blows taxpayer $ on NFL political stunt. Mainland PR Relatives/Voters, remember this
@HouseGOP @SenateGOP
Nowhere near Vega Baja!! You aren’t doing enough. Speak out against this lackluster attempt or RESIGN! Puerto Ricans are Americans!!
Aibonito needs food & water
Nice how fema and Trump have turned there back on Puerto Rico
Caimito needs water. Please help people in that God forsaken mountain.
Brock needs to be arrested for his ignorance and racism or acting like Cornyn. He is a disgrace & embarrassment to America for his racism.
#RenewJonesActWaiver
What right does Brock Long, an appointed govt official, have to diss and ignore the elected Mayor of San Juan. Trump needs to fire this jerk
You would think that FEMA Director would have measure of compassion for Puerto Rico and its leaders, rather than overt assholeness.
Why aren't supplies getting to western PR? https://www.facebook.com/jason.maddy.7/posts/1635371743202043 …
@FEMA_Brock you are the noise that needs to go @fema shut up and do your job or let someone who care do it
Can't better containers be provided for the water??
Not enough. #FEMA and #DonaldTrump are not doing what they need to do. https://m.facebook.com/jason.maddy.7/posts/1635371743202043 …
Look how Cornyn treated this family.
Wade has #CerebralPalsy. His story inspires me to fight for every American to have the healthcare they need. https://youtu.be/DzA83Jj_wcA 

VERY IMPORTANT: Water in Puerto Rico should be boiled, per U.S Defense Dept. & Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Authority. Spread the word
How many WEEKS did it take to provide this water?

I’m not sure who created this but whoever you are...it made me weep. 

 
Brock will never be lokjef at the same when Trump goes down. People are without food and water and he calls it political nonsense.  Like 45, he has no shame or humanity-another FAKE.
Oops-looked
It's only been 3 weeks.

'I am begging...we are dying' — San Juan's mayor is stepping up for Puerto Rico since Trump won't  #FireBrock
You Should Be FIRED IMMEDIATELY Ignoring The Mayor Bc your Boss the #Manbaby #Bully Can't Handle The TRUTH Shame on you M"Fers
Brock: you are incompetent, insensitive, bi partisan designee.  Resign now.
I wish you were bi partisan, but we know that's not true. This is  a public service job. Heartless people like you can't be running FEMA
Whom to believe...45, his FEMA appointee n Gov kissing ass as he should do to not piss off 45 or my family w/o water
50% without water, 90% without electricity and this administration actively hiding information about the situation. Putin sends his regards.
Only because they were shamed once again.
Can you give us a list of PR communities "filtered out" because they're not bootlicking King Cheeto and @FEMA_Brock ?
Does it hurt your back to kiss your own ass @fema_brock? Instead of playing political games, Brock should get off his lazy ass! #PuertoRico

Gee, it's only been how long?
After how many weeks and deaths? Useless agency! Should delete @DHSgov . It turned decent agencies into American Gestapo.
Yet 90% of the people still have no electricity or tap able water...  3 weeks senator,  3 weeks.
Rappers and reality tv show stars (not Trump) are doing more than you are.
WHY EDIT FEMA WEB PAGE?  Something to hide???
What's taking you so long to respond? If PR was a foreign country with OIL, we would've established water, electrical and shelter.... SAD.
Then they can quit laying blame on every else. God bless you for all you and Our Armed Forces do.  
R these ppl taught to be prepared for storms?Do the hosp have good generators?Shouldnt they KNOW 2 get gas prior?How bout a teaching class?
Hey Brock has that water been filtered out?
"We filtered out the mayor a long time ago?"
Jesus.
Resign.
Thanks to many independent groups stepping up to help, because Brock seems very defensive, and acts like helping PR is such a pain.
Please listen to the Mayor of San Juan when she begs for assistance! "Tuning her out" is shameful.
Now we are talking! Por fin, they had to drive to rhe metro area to ger some drinking water!
Resign now
Puerto Rico status today
43% lack water access
88% lack electricity
88% w/o power, and the FEMA Dir bragging about ignoring the San Juan mayor. This is Trump's Katrina, but you don't care at all. Shame!
.@FEMA_Brock You need to resign.
.@VP @POTUS @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi 

FEMA brings “oasis” to PR, therefore admitting there is NO WATER.  Please help.  #PuertoRicoCrisis
Can y'all tell the mayor? She thinks the sky is falling
The sky has fallen for the mayor! Wow, just WOW! She has been begging for people's lives!
