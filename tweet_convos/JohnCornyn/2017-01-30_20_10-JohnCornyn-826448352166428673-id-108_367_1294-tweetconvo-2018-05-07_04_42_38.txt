Her job is to protect the Constitution. Not the President.
But, she is not the determining factor of which laws are constitutional. The the responsibility of SCOTUS
He fired her for disagreeing with him. Anyone who disagrees with him, he just degrades and shuts down. Look up tyrant.
He fired her for sedition. Only liberals degrade w/personal insults and shut down logical reasoning. Look up #libtard
Except, you just just threw out the insult. Very mature of you. Thanks for insulting Veterans.
No, I didn't insult you. I merely suggested looking up a word. If you didn't try to spin words your comprehension would improve.
Look up a made up hateful word? I don't need to. I comprehend pefectly. But continue to condescend. You do it well.
Thank you. It's just one of the things I excel at.
YOU MEAN SHE DID DO HER JOB!!!!! YOU FUCKING ASSHOLES. be loyal to this administration, history will remember.
@JohnCornyn more alternative facts......
No, he fired her for doing her job.
@JohnCornyn she did her job. Trump overstepped "bigly" #RESIST #impeachtrump
Shameful, following the laws of the nation instead of Donald's orders, Sessions agreed during conf. hearing.
She understands the Constitution. Trump does not.
The important thing is not that Hillary understands the Constitution, IT'S YOUR UNDERSTANDING of it. Be smart.
- what, pray tell, causes you to bring up Hillary in a discussion about acting AG?
@JohnCornyn - AG is supposed to follow the rule of law, not the rule of 1 man
How dare she follow the laws of the land.   Last I checked, that was her job.   HMMMMM
The AG isn't meant to be a rubber stamp for the President. @MattWalshBlog
Yeah, she put aside careerism and partisanship and went with citizenship and principle. Unlike you, obviously.
what is her job, exactly? From what I can see, most attorneys don't agree with you.
Love you and your work!!!!
I posted the same video showing what a hypocrite she is. By the way Liberals commenting here, nice classy use of English
I'm amazed that anyone is defending Trump's actions. The odds of him being impeached are 11/10 worth a bet
here are some current stats.
How many people in USA where killed by the banned countries?
How many Americans shot each other
IS MURDER THEIR ONLY OPTION? Other crimes don't matter?
@JohnCornyn when it comes to the Constitution of America we all should be concerned, are TXSenators protecting us fromBannon?
Or maybe she was protecting Constitution like Sessions asked her to do two years ago?
@JohnCornyn sometimes a retweet is all we need. #weseeyou
So can @POTUS be fired for not doing his job? Pretty logical.  No big deal. Calm down.
@JohnCornyn her job is to defend the constitution which she did. Kind of a big deal.
What job?  Upholding the constitution, or...?
Can't NBD this. If you aren't concerned you aren't paying attention.
@JohnCornyn AG's job is stand for constitution and rule of law, not take orders from the Pres. How quickly your values fade!
Somehow I doubt @MattWalshBlog had the same thought about Kim Davis in Kentucky.
No, she was fired because she DID her job! Her allegiance is to the consititution, NOT to POTUS!
We Texans are voting you out soon, @JohnCornyn! You are worse than a traitor to our country.
seriously
@JohnCornyn  her job isn't to agree with the president.   Her job is to defend the constitution &  to protect the people
Don't do your job. You get fired. Simple!

.@MattWalshBlog @JohnCornyn Maybe a Republican can explain to you why this is important.
Jeff Sessions grilled Sally Yates on her duty to follow the law during a 2015 hearing http://cnn.it/2jR1uLW  
this is called DOING her job. You must misunderstand what that criteria is. Lucky for you she outlined it here.
Can you please ask AG Nominee Jeff Sessions this question - the one you asked of Sally Yates? Thank you!
@JohnCornyn her job is not to be a puppet for the Prez.
Trump fired predictably fired Yates because he is a thin-skinned narcissist.
@JohnCornyn AG swears to uphold the Constitution not be the President's toady
@JohnCornyn her job is to follow the law and the constitution- not represent the president
Trump fired Yates because he cannot tolerate anyone saying "No" to him
@JohnCornyn Yates stood her ground for the rule of law.
@JohnCornyn her job is to uphold the law not placate the president.
Trump fired the AG because she told HIM no. Her job was to stand for the Constitution and the American people.
The AG was engaging in fundamental civil disobedience. Kudos for her. But not a crisis, true.
@JohnCornyn She did her job.
@JohnCornyn she was fired for doing her job.  I wish the GOP would stand up to him.  -signed a voting Texan
@JohnCornyn Obviously the big deal is that her job was to enforce the law, not illegal executive orders.
@JohnCornyn took an oath to defend the constitution something the @POTUS needs to learn how to do. #Education  is failing us.
has it been proven unconstitutional? If so please post it here. Thanks
@JohnCornyn thanks for being level headed.
@JohnCornyn actually- she was fired for DOING her job.
@JohnCornyn she was defending the constitution.  That's her job! #resistance
@JohnCornyn WRONG. it's a crisis when constitutional rights are being violated by executive orders. fire DJT's hacks in 2018!
@JohnCornyn Her 'job' is to uphold the law.  YOU are the ones not doing your jobs! Stop being a sheep. Voters are watching
She was protecting us
@JohnCornyn and yes everything is a civilization crisis when trump is causing all this with EO #VoteHimOut2020 #impeachtrump
@JohnCornyn she did her job, trump is just a big cry baby if not everyone sides with him. He is worst than my 3 yr old
No, he fired her because she wouldn't illegally tow the line and opposed him. Def a big deal, Senator.
The AG's job is to uphold the constitution! Not bow down to a little tin god! #ImpeachTrump #StopPresidentBannon #resist
@JohnCornyn During Watergate Nixon fired Cox for refusing to compromise on a subpoena for the tapes. Saturday night massacre
@JohnCornyn this EO is how neofascists in Greece treated our blond American family. Glad I can vote against supporters here
@JohnCornyn he fired her because she wouldn't do what he wanted. Even if it was unconstitutional. Kind of a big deal.
Except, according to @SenatorSessions, she was doing her job, if it's unlawful/unjust.
@JohnCornyn He fired her because she wldn't defend UNCONSTITUTIONAL order. Good to know Cornyn is ready to "follow orders".
You guys have no credibility when it comes to what is unconstitutional. Obamacare, 2nd amend, etc
what? did they program you with buzzwords? Reporting you for spam and blocking.
@JohnCornyn the AG's job is to protect us not bow down to a dictator. I respect fired AG!
Thank you
check out General Stanley McCrystal
Yep. A President who wants an AG to enforce the law instead of their political opinion.
@JohnCornyn what's a crisis is no politician upholding the constitution including these weak tea asides
.@MattWalshBlog @JohnCornyn Okay but what about this then
Boom! Nice find! @davelevitan @MattWalshBlog @JohnCornyn
She was faithful to the Constitution, not to the President. That's what *ALL* AGs should do, regardless of party.
The AG changes relatively frequently, especially with incoming administrations. This isn't news.
@realDonaldTrump fired a @BarackObama appointee, oh the horror
isn't it what the left wanted when Kim Davis wouldn't uphold the law?
good for him.
I recall when the left wanted a clerk fired for not doing her job issuing marriage licenses.
because the clerk refused to follow the law.
Here, someone else picked this up also. Follow @seanmdav http://thefederalist.com/2015/09/03/kim-davis-shows-that-breaking-the-law-is-only-okay-when-progressives-do-it/ …
Again she refused to follow the law. Not saying right or wrong.
The liberals are too accustomed to the AG not defending the law under attack.
there is no calm.. There is only zuul
@xoxoAnnalisa714   Trump is killing the American dream. You have no idea what his plans are. And when it's over, you will cry
fire doom brimstone meteors
And she's effectively a Temp
What was the job she refused to do? Agree with @POTUS every decision? That's NOT the AG's job description.
"I won't quit, you'll have to fire me" is a perfectly honorable position to take. Kim Davis told me so.
anyone know the odds to his impeachment? I'm in NV
.....and Matt Said this. So, believe him. He hates Trump 
Yep, it's called the real world.
"Catastrophic thinking can be defined as ruminating about irrational worst-case outcomes."  - Psychology Today
I'm sure she would be gone when Sessions got there Matt.
.@MattWalshBlog Same ppl angry that AG was fired 4 not doing her job r the 1s that called 4 Kim Davis 2b fired 4 not doin hers.Both should b
kinda like how people said the lady who wouldn't issue same sex marriage licenses should be fired. That's different though...
Yea and she went public with it. Big no no. She left Trump no choice.
You'll soon be on the wrong side of history.

He took the bait.  Getting set up for Impeachment. All he had to do was wait a few days for Sessions.  Obama outplayed him
100% agree! People are acting like a bunch of drama queens or kings or in this day and age, quings!
Her job is to uphold the Constitution.  She was fired for doing her job.  Make America white again, right?
It seems it's impossible for them to calm down. They've been in an almost 3 month long tantrum since Trump was elected. ATWTW
...an acting AG who was a Dem holdover from a hostile former administration, no less.
*originally appointed by GWB*
*“a Dem holdover“*
Riiiight.
They can't calm down. They are totally unhinged.
but they won't. Bannon warned them but they just can't do it.
pretty clear insubordination. Try that at any job, see what happens.
nope libs will make it a big deal just like the hissy fits they've been throwing since Nov
