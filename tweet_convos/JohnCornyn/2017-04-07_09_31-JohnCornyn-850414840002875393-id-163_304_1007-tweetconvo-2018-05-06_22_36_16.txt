TREASON #trumprussia
Stolen Seat. Let's cut to the chase: Gorsuch only has one job, to defend Citizens United. Only reason you guys hired him. Enjoy your $$.
The way he was confirmed is a shame and the R's should be ashamed of being so selfish they would rob posterity of a noble Senate.
They have no shame. They are disgusting.
I know. It literally makes me sick.
Great news for preserving Constitution of US. Keep going Reps, let's put in 3 more SCOTUS over the next 8 years.
Actually the Constitution does not say that you can stonewall one nominee for 11 months until you get the nominee you want. I checked. Liars

Gorsuch cast deciding vote to execute death row inmate. All Clinton and Obama appointees voted no. Elections matter. https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/gorsuch-casts-death-penalty-vote-in-one-of-his-first-supreme-court-cases/2017/04/21/2d9bc5dc-26a8-11e7-a1b3-faff0034e2de_story.html â€¦
Congratulations on your #stolenseat and changing 2 centuries' rules to suit your agenda. #iwillrememberin2018
The next seat needs to go to a left-wing justice to balance the books and heal the country after the @POTUS/@VP/@SpeakerRyan trials.
Love! Love! Love! +++
This is exactly what the country needs to help us get back on course!
Who do you guys think you are kidding? Your all on the deep $$ payroll. It's not like you're even trying to hide it.
The forever Pretender in the SCOTUS robe.
That "Pretender" is the highest Justice in the land. 
Associate Justice... and it doesn't make his appointment any less disreputable.
Shameful treatment of Garland, but more importantly a shameful treatment of our rule of law.  Mitch McConnell is a horrible person.  Period.
Mitch McConnell is evil dressed up as someone's sweet grandpa.
So much for integrity.
Heard you accepted money from Big Tobacco.
Wonder what the Morman Church will think about THAT.
#SellsSoulforCigMoney
Well, all the pieces are falling right into place...for the burgeoning American kleptocracy!
I just wish I could like this twice!
I HOPE HE'S READ THE "ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE" IN THE U S CONSTITUTION.  A STRICT CONSTRUCTIONIST WOULD CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE MEANNG OF IT!
It was wonderful to watch!!!  So happy to have a man with Judge Gorsuch's credentials!
Looking for terrorist wanting to do harm to this country, look no further than GOP.  See you in '18, traitors.
You people could not be more disgusting.
@OrrinHatch
One of my 1st comments was whether 45 owned STOCK in missile mfr's company. Sure enough he DOES. Follow the money (and his approval ratings)
Very Happy congratulations

Deaf you all are!!  Blowing up the Senate for a nominee of an admin being investigated for treason. Such a waste and disgust for Americans!
Stop trying to put lipstick on a pig, it's transparent and insulting.
Finally some justice on our court.
Shameful!
Plagiarist, new writer for Melania?
Why won't trump release his taxes? Release Trump's taxes to an independent investigation of Russia's influence on this administration
You have cheated & politicized the Court. Gorsuch isn't legit.
More like Stolen. We will see how your party feels if the role is reversed because it will happen.
You have destroyed our democracy for your own satisfaction, a "win" and our forefathers are rolling in their graves. You will pay next vote
YES you confirmed plagiarized who REFUSED 2meet with female senators WOW!U call this "extremely" qualified? We say qualified like all judges
STOLEN and a damn disgrace to democracy.
The thieving Republicans prove cheating still works. #thievingrepublicans #unqualifiedgorsuch #unamerican
- SECOND JOBS REPORT ON TRUMP TODAY, NOT GOOD.!! JUST 98T? .SHORT OF WHAT CLAIMED.? 2ND LIE TODAY GORSUCH, JOBS!
You do know that your NUCLEAR option is a rallying cry for the opposing forces. The good guys always win in America.
#Stolen #Idiots #Shameful
#SupremeCourtThieves #Idiots #Liars
Sad day 100% of all 5-4 decisiona are forever tainted by corruption and partisan BS
I can't wait until you're up for reelection. #You'reOut
This is not a win. Pathetic show of weakness to change rules to get your way. #midtermsarecoming #FlipCongress2018
OBAMA +SYRIA PLAN+CONSTITUTIONALLY ASK CONGRESS=@SenateGOP @HouseGOP SAID NOPE. TRUMP DOES IT ILLEGALLY+NO PLAN=GOP SAY AWESOME!!!
We needed and still need more centrists!
Yea! We said F U to the Dems and founding fathers!  We are so great! We are great! #resist
Great news! 
Good job
Godspeed Justice Gorsuch
You all suck
Just like the election, the GOP has to cheat to get their way.
What a sneaky way to slither into office. Ugh. Sad day for America.
Only a man with no self-respect would accept a stolen seat. #MerrickGarland
Disgusted.
GREAT JOB  @POTUS,  GREAT JOB GOP, WELL DONE
@realDonaldTrump remember this date as the day democracy died at the hands of thieving republicans #MerrickGarland #LockTrumpup #nevergop
He'll forever be known as the illegitimate justice thanks to the games @SenateGOP played undermining our democracy
Sad,sad,sad.
All of you guys are lower mind monkeys that think you're better than everyone else. What goes around comes around.
Idiots.
It is a bad day when two parties cannot put politics aside and be bipartisan for the good of the country. Sad day for democracy for future
Confirmed: Justice Stolen #SCOTUS
CONFIRMED ! HOUSE OF THIEVES,  TA DAH!
GOP traitors. You sold us to corporate interests and this will not be forgotten.  #2018
How you could even consider this unqualified candidate while trump is under investigation is a disgrace. You have no moral ethics
A sad day in America history when the @GOP ignores our democracy and sets a deplorable precedent. YOU WILL PAY in the next election.
thank y'all for screwing with our democracy so y'all can get your own way.  what a bunch of bullies. note.this snowflake is tough as nails!
A stolen seat done by racists - Election Day we won't forget what you all have done.
And it only cost the integrity of the party to do it!
Too chicken to try and get 60 votes, so you just simply change the rules. Typical
One promise of Trumps has been met. Yay. Keep going.
So so sad! A stolen nomination! The GOP SHOULD be so ashamed!
And the GOP pretends they did nothing wrong the past year. One less reason for any attempt at bipartisanship.
Thanks for securing America's future, the US Constitution lives and will live into the future!
congratulations!
Congratulations. Justice Neil Gorsuch...Your An Asset To Our Supreme Court Branch..A Welcome Addition..God Bless You..God Bless America
Proud?  History will remember Gorsuch as the occupier of a stolen seat.
Not gonna win me over with some dumb little video
Shame on you all. Hope you feel it at the next election. This is nothing to be proud of.
Stolen seat. Shameful no decency.
Sad day in America. I'm sorry for all those hurt during this partisan hack job. This cannot continue. Look at other's with divided democracy
WE are proud you came through & PUT an END 2 #OBSTRUCTIONIST_DEMS holding America HOSTAGE for TOO long! @POTUS we NEED 2FREE & REBUILD USA!
@Protrump45 2/ them playing a game with THEIR OWN RULES!Liberals wanna use "rule changes" & etiquette when it's n their favor!SMH
Senate Republicans can't lead and ZERO credibility!
@SenThomTillis #StolenSeat Dark Day for SCOTUS
At what cost to American democracy?
@Protrump45 1/ funny, I haven't heard anybody whine like this since I was 10 y/o & the other team would get mad cause you beat
Ya got your man but lost your cred
Praise the Lord!
You are a gang of thieves. The notions that Republicans adhere to the Constitution has been decimated. I will not vote R again.
Praise God! May our new justice be one of the best ever. May God gift him with wisdom.
Awesome!
What you all have done is disgusting and unAmerican. #shame For people who claim to love the Constitution, you ignore it. A lot.
@SenThomTillis we won't forget how you accomplished it either.  Come on back home and face your constituents Thom. It's time
You all suck!
congratulation Judge Neil Gorsuch and now our Constitution will be protected.
The last time a select group of aristocrats sought to rule and tax us without representation: we shot them all dead.
Boo 
@Protrump45 Good! Gentleman & Ladies, we know what happened w/Schrewmers & the filibuster, we "don't believe the hype"
Great day welcome aboard
#PurchasedParty confirm Gorsuch for the #GreedyOnePercent #HABITUALLIERS #SHAMELESSSHYTERS
Finally!! Congratulations to a fine man.
Stolen seat, good luck with your next election
Good luck with your reelections. You all suck. #complicit
Way to go @SenateGOP, you just screwed America..again
VOTE THEM OUT ?
Congrats!!! Glad its over so congress can no go on a huge vacation!! Waste of money
NOT "confirmed". Placed by a power hungry Senate majority. Perverting the Constitution to further their agenda. #DISGRACE
Disgrace: Republicans. All of you need to go. Liars and cheats.
I'd say you must be proud that you destroyed democracy but you feel no shame soo...
Justice Scalia is smiling ! #JusticeGorsuch
Your grandchildren will know justice was sold.
Yes he got a stolen seat with a #NuclearOption The Congress rules forever changed. @SenateMajLdr #Mitch needs to go.
Thankyou @potus, @SenateMajLdr , and all @realDonaldTrump voters! #WINNING
Confirmed: Justice Neil Gorsuch*  #SCOTUS

*Seat was stolen from Merrick Garland and STILL needed rule change to win

Fixed it for you.
Ummm. No. The constitution allows for the senate to not approve by simply not voting. They didn't approve. That's not stealing. Civics 101
2018

Careful there, Brian. Some Lib may sue you for a seizure.
Lies
Merick Garland, Merick Garland, Merick Garland, Merick Garland, Merick Garland, Merick Garland, Merick Garland, Merick Garland
Oh, by the way, Merick Garland
VOTE THEM OUT! #votethemout
CHEATERS! Double standard.
But at what cost? #NuclearOption
To all Senators who twisted rules to confirm the nominee of @POTUS being investigated for treason: #historyiswatchingyou #countryoverparty
Obama and his minions did the same thing in 2013..paybacks a bitch ain't it
Were you in favor of it then? Or just now? I think both are wrong. Aren't we supposed to be working together for the good of the country?
About time the gop grew a set..keep it up
CONFIRMED: @GOP has got to go. Anybody who would change rules rather than follow them has forevermore weakened our system. DISGUSTING.
Not to worry, the Mercers are done with the Trump family now so it will be a one-term deal. NEXT!
Congrats #SCOTUS Gorsuch!
Correct spelling for eternity will now be *Gorsuch
