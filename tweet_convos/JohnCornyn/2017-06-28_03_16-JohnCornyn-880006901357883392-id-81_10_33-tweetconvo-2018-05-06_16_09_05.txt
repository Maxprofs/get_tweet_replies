What about the millions of additional victims you want to add to the new bill's passage?
Victims? You know who will actually be victims? The 23 million who won't be covered under your senate bill!
Obamacare's "victims" disagree. It's literally saving lives.
And your lies aren't sticking. Millions who need health insurance will lose it on your plan bc of Medicaid cuts.
As a disabled Texan college student with insurance through her mother's ObamaCare plan, the GOP bill would make insurance unaffordable.
If so fix ACA- don't just rob the poor and give it to the rich.
Now that you'll have more time to discuss the bill with folks from TX, please come to the Texas Medical Center and meet with leadership
LIAR
DO NOT pass the bill. We, your constituents, demand better from you, demand better than ObamaCare, and THIS IS NOT IT.
Quit lying about healthcare. The 22 million you want to kick off healthcare are the victims you doosh!
"Obama care victims" live in Republican run states that haven't expanded Medicaid! Just look at this map @VP shared!

POINT 7: CBO lays blame for the insurer exit largely with Trump.   In fact... 12 
No argument ObamaCare needs fixed, are you saying current BCRA is your effort and you believe it to be best solution for America? Do own it?
'Victims.' Ridiculous. Americans are victimized by a shockingly overpriced healthcare system, not a law that gave us consumer protections.
Price's has one care http://only.How  much the 1 precent tax cut puts in his pocket He has showed his greed with his stock tricks
We are the victims of rampant Republican greed.
You are a disgrace to this Great Nation
We want bipartisan repair of A C A.
Insurers need to knew on a longer term basis than weekly whether they get CSR.
Tell the administration to stop dilly dallying on CSR payments, its causing your consitutuents premiums to rise.
