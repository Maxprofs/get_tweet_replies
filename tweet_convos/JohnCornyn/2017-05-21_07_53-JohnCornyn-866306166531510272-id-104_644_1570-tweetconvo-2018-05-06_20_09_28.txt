He has no credibility, you know. How can he talk about refugees from Syria when he won't welcome any to the US?
Why should we ? Create safe zones in their own country if we want to help ! Keep our culture , history,  @American citizens @USA PROTECTED !
Our country is at far greater risk from angry white men with unfettered access to weapons than it is from a traumatized refugee.
Yeah, well go to Dearborn Mich.and then tell me how we are safe.Or to Lansing Mich.Go to those towns and start preaching about Jesus.
@knotperfkt What is happening here that you feel is not safe? And we have quite a few Christian churches so free free to attend.
Then you are no better than the muslims that are in your city counsel, to let Islamic prayer to be allowed in pulic schools there.
Are Christian prayers allowed in the public schools in Dearborn?
No
Is there such a thing as Rose colored earmuffs?
Are you saying that when Obama gave similar speech you too thought it was strong and no nonsense?
Oh that's rich
Blah blah blah socialist falsehoods. Your ignorance bores & belies lack of ability for true discourse. Good luck *polishing* trumpsbigballs
Well, I'm sure he did after they gave 100M to his daughter's "foundation". #PayToPlay
Well, no mention of “radical islamic terrorism” so there’s that.
Well at least he will take all their oil. No? Wait, what?
We don’t even need it anymore.
Who is?
President Trump was AWESOME !!!!!
Trump says what ppl want to hear, he really don't give a shit! I, personally don't believe a "Got Damn Thing He Says"!
Great speech
OUTSTANDING! God bless POTUS Trump!
Funny how he mentioned Iran's meddling in Syria but not Russia's
His audience looks like prisoners in the yard listening to the Warden speak
Not "radical Islamic terrorism"?
I heard Prez is wearing a shock collar to keep him from going off script during his overseas trip.
Oh J.D., I liked you better when you were spinning tracks at Much Music, than spinning lies for Faux News. See what I did there?
Thank you JR for positive clip
Trusting in forming partnerships united in the eradication of a global evil will predicate a future of global peace throughout the world.
The Middle East greets the return of common sense to the US Presidency.
WOW Israel-UAE deal significant breakthrough. Israel given UAE  overflight, Israeli businesses can open branches, telephone service  open.
That's all it is ..  WORDS! Actions of selling arms to Saudis whom supply those same terrorists make us complicit in every way.
You address extremism and terrorism by advocating for human rights not by ignoring a country that treats people like chattel.
I'm liking the new JR
Powerful, direct and unifying speech! Proud of our @POTUS
Extending a hand of friendship, while expressing your honest feelings respectfully, goes a long way to building a relationship of trust.
Thank you John for being fair and balanced.
Thank u John f review
You know this POTUS is going down and you are clinging on to the ship. The lifeboats are not coming for you.
Oh u mean Israel's occupation of the Palestinian people? REALLY.? WOW How did that go?
Great job John! We need more journalists like you!
He's smoking out the terrorist sympathisers
@EyeCandyTMGayle @realDonaldTrump John Roberts is one of the best Journalists out there! We trust his reports!
That's what @BarackObama lacked. Leadership and respect by the outside world especially Arabs.
I have news for u. Check out BBC, France, Australia, Canada, Mexico, and sev other country's news. They all think trump is an idiot. #read
@Carol38553 @realDonaldTrump There's the hat, I'll be waiting for the cattle. #Moo
He read his speech from a TelePrompTer. He's done that b4, then tanked it with a tweet. Wait 4 it 
Donald Trump just walked back every word he uttered on Middle East during his campaign, is not honoring his own words, & Ivanka gets $100mil
He's all nonsense. He has tough talk here at home but gets scared abroad. Not so tough anymore. All smoke and mirrors.
Your doing a great job and so are POTUS and SOS.  Thank you for the coverage
@JohnCornyn only watches/reads Fox and the Washington Examiner.  That's both ignorant and terrifying for a "representative". #complicit
Yikes! R they buying the crap he's spewing cuz we know he doesn't believe it. He doesn't believe in anything but himself!
Ask your Boss why they flipped to Comegate? Should've aired all day long!  @realDonaldTrump
Lets don't give full points for reading someone else's viewpoint
Why does he talk one way to Muslim people, respectfully and another crude  way to Americans?
@JohnCornyn @realDonaldTrump When its to his advantage
and some how you all magically forget he wants Muslims out of the US. This is a con at work and y'all are dumb enough to fall for it!
A very proud moment for Americans. A president that LOVES AMERICA!! FINALLY
Celebrity Apprentice 6 (season 13) cast members Gary Busey and Marilu Henner might just be able to help!
Lol. Irony. It is such a tragic joke
Well said, bravo for being independent
alliance with Saudi and Israel will eliminate radical Islam...Saudis have power to eliminate radical Islam.
You do realise that 9 of the 9/11 bombers were from Saudi
@johnrobertsFox  The Saudi Arabian probably wrote that shit for him
Fawning over the Saudis that 9 of the 911 Hijackers came from ,Collecting 100 million for Ivanka little group .Pay to Play
I can get behind this. Let Saudi king eradicate ISIS. He funds majority of terrorism anywya
GREAT SPEECH!!
Wow. The first truth from you
HE doesn't know the roots of terrorism. He is just a turnip
Absolutely ! @realDonaldTrump a real World Leader in @American White House ! Working for @USA ! No fake red lines leading with strength !
@benshapiro doesn't think so. He thinks it was pointless. 
Awesome reporting! President Trump gave a fabulous speech too!
@JohnCornyn You can't make a pig's ear into a silk purse. #Trumplackey
Sounds like a good idea so why the blatantly discriminatory #MuslimBan ?
Um hypocrisy much? Reminder to the world: he's a liar and will say or do anything to personally profit. A CON!
Then why do I have to hear immediately after speech RUSSIA COMEY?? Embarrassing - ppl are running away from msm - fed up
Fox News immediately went to pretaped show. Media Buzz. No live discussion if speech. What fool made that decision?
So @JohnCornyn you're all about sucking up to a monarchy where the 9/11 hijackers came from, while hating a democracy because reasons?
Understand and appreciate this opportunity you have been given,once in a lifetime this happens and you were there!
Well done President! Arabic world is against syria and Iran for their extreme terrorism!
Has he apologized for his hateful comments about Islam?  Trump is corrupt as fuck and it's no news that the Saudis are as well.
Bravo Mr. President. Outstanding speech!!
Are you a journalist or opinion commentator? Very blurred lines on Fox.
Trump is a terrible orator. His audience appears bored and they already knew his disdain for Islam & his "ban" held up in court. Hypocrite!
It will go to the Supreme Court. Illegal immigrants of Muslim decent are coming thru southern borders & changing their surnames to Hispanic
Outstanding speech
I really wish this admin would figure out if they're anti-Muslim or not. https://twitter.com/jacktweets11/status/866304859246657537 …
Kudos! Well done!
@JohnCornyn @johnrobertsFox @realDonaldTrump & this would've WONERFUL if this had been his INAUGURAL ADDRESS. 
A vote of confidence for the peaceful people of this world . I'm thankful!
He's reading something someone else wrote & has no idea what it means. Seems to be sedated, & gonna put the audience to sleep with monotone
Taking his time for translators
Are Syria and Iran in the room?
I would think no since he said some pretty negative things about iran

.@POTUS: "America is a sovereign nation, and our first priority is always the safety and security of our citizens." 
Thank you President @realDonaldTrump !  @usmarines @USVeteransCorps  @Conservative_VW  @Onelifetogive  @LindaHogan  @DennisCarothers @NRA
Very strong, sober speech. Impressive #RiyadhSummit
A good example of normalizing an abnormal, corrupt president.
Thanks for name calling. Very persuasive.
You deserve it. So you're welcome.
Said nothing about the election.
"Just as long as you don't try to enter the US..." There. Fixed that for ya.
I'm sorry you hope for terrorism to come into our country. #maga
Your soul FULLY CONDEMNED @johnrobertsFox @BretBaier @seanhannity @ShannonBream @newtgingrich @IngrahamAngle
And doing it Hugely
