And what's your point 
6. YEARS. /cough
Maybe ICE is just letting them in?
Hey Cornyn ILLEGAL is not a NOUN. Your racism comes loud & clear in this tweet. #darkmoneymonkey
Things R not looking good for U w/ #treason running through UR party so U want to pick on vulnerable people. #Shame #DarkMoney
It's been declining since Bush...and Obama had the record for deportations. He just wasn't a racist dbag when discussing it like the POTUS.
And Obama implemented common sense policies like DACA. Whereas Trump has ideas that are obvious pandering BS like Mexico paying. 
Thanks Obama!
Hey, great. That means there's no reason to spend billions $$$ on a wall. #NoWall
Of course trump is President ain't nobody from anywhere wanting to come here.


I just don't understand WHY you won't STOP Russia - when those at the border have done less harm to USA... WHY???
Awesome.

I can't wait for the 53% price hike in the cost of fresh vegetables and chicken.
-but think of the huge savings of not supporting illegals
John's ego has grown past his capabilities. Whether he runs or not depends on where the most $ is. He could be indicted and jail Trumpgate.
The #invisible #BorderWall is already working. Thank you @realDonaldTrump for #MakeAmericaSafeAgain
Not so fast big guy -> Illegal immigration spikes along U.S.-Mexico border - Washington Times
Maybe they figure out our tyrant leader is decimating our nation. Nice try douche canoe.
Please stop referring to people as "illegals." They are human beings.
"illegal" is an adjective, not a noun, @JohnCornyn
When does impeachment begin?
Why would anyone want to come to the dumpster fire that you, Donald, and Putin have turned America into? Of course it's dropping
Ppl aren't illegal. R some undocumented? Yes; illegal, no. Also, when is ur next town hall? I'm road tripping 2 OH 4 school, I can stop by
That's a function of economics south of the border, nothing you can take credit for. Sorry.


That's what happens when you promise to actually punish lawbreakers. It get's even lower when you follow through.
Who wants to be in this country running by idiots
Oh YAY means we can spend wall money on healthcare!!
It's MY money you're spending!  Tax money isn't free healthcare it's legalized theft.
Curious about that argument? And what makes it solely YOUR money? Legalized theft but not if building a wall... very curious
You vote for people that increase taxes from employers and workers. I vote for people that lower taxes.  Taxes are theft by fiat.
Interesting that you make two assumptions... first that you know who I voted for...haha... just b/c I care about people and second..
Hard to not make assumptions inside 140.  But you should know a wall IS caring, government taking over healthcare isn't caring it's death.
That sir is your opinion and I completely disagree! Hope you have a blessed day!
I respect your willingness for thoughtful debate.  Have a good day as well.
Why would anyone want to come here?  Corruption, fraud, grifters in control?  Get a grip, John.
You support the idiot in the WH, your words mean ZILCH.
-so you think a wall isn't needed- don't even go there-we don't want a decrease/ if they want in, they do it LEGALLY-is that asking too much
When are you going to protect America?
How much damage are you going to let this charlatan do to our country?
What are you waiting for?
100% increase in Presidents wanting Russia to help with our cyber security (codename Fox&Friends Guard the Henhouse)
Nobody cares. Collusion with Russia is what everybody is talking about. Healthcare which @GOP is failing the people should be your concern.
Dude, come on, no human being is "illegal." Try to conduct yourself as if you represent all Texans and not just your rich, white friends
"Illegals," sir? Really? Can you not use that dehumanizing language?
Because?  Less coming over or more being ignored and allowed to live here without deportation?
I wouldn't want to come here either. And another link to this news site? 
Yeah. You have lots to answer for . #votedem2018 #catholicsocialjustice
That number has been going down since the W crash. Don't think it has anything w/ 45 or his #45sBootlickers
Maybe more are coming through without being caught?  Can you Prove why or are you trying to mislead with a quick tweet?
Explains why there are crops rotting in the fields and such a shortage of labor in construction and food service.
Just change the spelling of your last name to KKKornyn and be done with it
How much has tourism dropped since Trump took office? Have a town hall and let's talk about it.
Every country has better healthcare than the US.
and as this happens who are people building houses n working in fields? bc developers don't hav the people.

We get rid of dreamer laws it would drop even more. You have no right to citizenship if your parents are here illegally in my opinion.
"Two wrongs don't make a right."
Build the wall so we don't ever have a new influx of illegals again. Talk is cheap, another liberal will open the border again.
Where have you been or is this the excuse 45 will use when there is no wall because the numbers were falling falling falling during Obama
That is why employers cannot find workers.
Probably means that the economy in Mexico is doing better - which is the usual forward indicator for immigration from anywhere. @POTUS @GOP
you sound like @SteveKingIA
Good so we don't need a wall! Now, go focus on healthcare that is actually good for the American people
Price of produce is going up because you & trumps policy
U need 2 join forces w @LindseyGrahamSC @marcorubio @SenJohnMcCain & stop this crazy cyber/Russia idea of POTUS!  what the hell is going on?

And we can thank DJT for this and NOT our Congress!  And you wonder why We the People don't have any trust in Govt! God bless our POTUS!
And you want a wall why?
Yet this idiot atill cries for a wall. GREAT JOHN.. Our country is in decline So bad that mexicans and el salvadorians dont want to be here
This country is unhinged. The fact refugees do not see it as a safe place any longer is not limited to refugees.

but Trump is still president and still a criminal, so John we are still losing! Do your job!
They're PEOPLE, Senator. NOT "illegals". You should be ashamed of yourself.
Trump loans, Russian money laundering eyed in Congressional query http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/trump-loans-russian-money-laundering-eyed-in-congressional-query-952937027733 … … via @msnbc
So you are saying we no longer need a  wall? Can we put that money towards botanical gardens and parks now?
Mr.tRump lover/supporter/diaper changer,
Please tweet good things that will support & inspire hard working middle class Texans.
And rising produce prices because there is no one to work the fields.
They're scared to death of us. US no longer gives refuge
54% drop in @JohnCornyn's credibility, as the #SoCalledSenator turns to #FakeNews sources like Breitbart and Washington Examiner
#shame
Cool. Now deploy more resources to round up the ones already here.
Can you comment on our president ignoring the NSA findings on Russian interference in our elections, accepting Putins explanation instead?

So have foreign students- especially to Texas schools. They know we have a culture of hate
John.why would anyone want to come into our country?If I didn't live here. I wouldn't want to visit with nutcases like you & trump in charge

About @realDonaldTrump’s purposely misleading Medicaid tweet... https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/28/15890750/trump-medicaid-chart-fix … 
Trump's making us a 3rd-world country so they figure why bother?
No one wants to come to America ,Nowgive your praise for  working with Putin with on cyber security cause you wil cause your all with Putin
This is unacceptable... #TrumpRussia https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/884012097805406208 … #25thAmendmentNow #25thAmendment
I strongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election. He vehemently denied it. I've already given my opinion.....
They also haven't done anything that would lead to decline, except elect a man who makes Mexicans feels unsafe living here. Congrats on that
Why are you so evil #NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare #BCRA #AHCA #SinglePayer #Medicaid
To be clear, Obamacare isn't failing. @realdonaldtrump is sabotaging it. 
That's because we have been at a negative immigration percentage for YEARS!  If your going to tell a story, tell the whole story 
Look at @realDonaldTrump tweets this morning.  How much longer can republicans defend this for the sake of an agenda????
Your president wants to form a cyber security task force with Putin.  He tweeted that this morning.  Do you or any republican agree w/him?
No need to build the wall then, right? The workers went to Canada or stayed home to harvest exportable crops & boost neighbor's economies.
You should check this one out. It's from one of your own.
Putin 1, Trump 0. An embarrassing and consequential diplomatic failure on Russia.
http://www.weeklystandard.com/trump-caves-to-putin/article/2008751 …
@POTUS No need for a wall.
Well now the US isnt an appealing country to go to!
John tell us your thoughts on working w Russia on cyber security....
