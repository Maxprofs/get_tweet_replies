The @GOP rarely gives the working citizen anything, & I doubt you'll start now.
Raising the minimum wage would also help. #RaiseMinimumWage #NoTaxCutForRich
Oh boy, we getting that Kansas economic collapse but Nationwide!
RETWEETING SOMEONE ELSE"S LIE IS STILL A LIE.  QUIT LYING TO TEXANS.  THIS IS WEALTH REDISTRIBUTION TO THE WEALTHY....MAYBE THAT 1%F WILL VOTE FOR YOU.....THE REST OF US WON'T IF THIS PASSES.  PRAY FOR INTEGRITY AND A BACKBONE.
Is that the only line you got #rethist this muthafuka
Can you guys do anything to help this country? All you have done is tried to push policies that help no one except your major donors.
And right now you can't even get that done when you control most of the government. Seriously asking... what do you do all day?
MANUFACTURING WILL NOT COME BACK! BECAUSE OF PROFITS! THEY WILL NOT GIVE EXTRAS TO EMPLOYEES! US AGAINST THEM! ((NO TO 1%))
In this Tax Reform let cut the reckless @DeptofDefense and @USNavy @USMC Budget.
@reperikpaulsen Please elaborate.  B/c the way I see it, the CEO's get to keep more $$.  Lies, Everyone  knows this. @IndivisibleMN03 #740
Yeah. Right. Those of us not in 1% know better

Get rid of Jones Act for #HelpPuertoRico.  If you want to let Americans die let other countries help them. #Shame #TaxCut #Swamp #Deficit ??
Liars
Two things will rise stocks and productivity.  Neither have raised wages over the last 40 years. We will go back to status quo pre 2009
Utter baloney. You always leave out the part how you are going to pay for this. Astronomical cuts in medicare and medicaid.
Some good idea's here JC, can we expect any action?
This seems...inaccurate. As one of your constituents I expect better. You know...actual facts.
In who's world? Yours or the real one? And what is that going to do to the deficit?
Senate will do anything except obstruct. Replace all incumbents.  We the people STANDUP.
$4,000 over 8 years is $500/year. This does not account for losing the state income tax deduction, which equates to HIGHER taxes for middle
So, you will require workers get a raise of 3.2% each year. In the form of unavoidable legislation with SEVERE penalties. Or is this theory?
At what cost? Social Security? Medicare? Medicaid? EPA? CHIP? National Parks? ACA? How much will tax reform really cost us?
Cornyn you are a follower supporting a dictatorial president  and legislation harmful to Americans.
Someone explain the meaning of raise to the American' it‘s taking a new definition according to the senate Republicans.
How about you prevent the man-child in the oval office from starting nuclear holocaust.
Then get back to rigging the tax code for the rich.
@JohnCornyn @WSJ and pad the pockets of wealthy help UR constituents John @MSNBC @texasdemocrats @TxBlackDemocrat @DFWIndivisible
The .@GOP plan will give tax breaks to wealthiest Americans and corporations at the expense of middle class. Also raises deficit by 1.5T!
No one shud get tax cuts right now. We're not only in debt, but need Trillions just to get back to par
We have ZERO reason to believe you.
You big problem is not tax reform but the guy you nominated into office.  I wish you would work at straighten out the person in our WH
Why does NFL deserve tax money for ungrateful elites. Use that money for medical research, hospitals, & community centers! 
Help the people!
In the same thought than senate Republicans if you want to earn quick money don't send your kids to college. you just earned their tuition.
Stop the disinformation and propaganda!  This proposal severely hurts the middle class, our country and is a huge transfer of wealth to the likes of Robert  Mercer, the Koch’s.  Those last tax cuts contributed to the debt along with military expenditure and Fed policy.
@JohnCornyn can't lie for shit. #KochHead

Today, @realDonaldTrump will come to Pennsylvania to push tax plan that gives 80% of benefits to the top 1% of the county.
Moron dotard is attacking the very idea of a free press, the new @gop standard. Puerto Rico relief is being hung on you. People are dying.
BS you people can’t even stand up to a disgusting human being Forget your legislature and be leaders not scared little boys afraid for jobs
GOP plan will raise taxes to middle and lower class by as much as 25%. Corporations and top1% will see tax relief.
It happened in the 60's because unions were strong and demanded such.  You (w/ dem help) have broken those; so likely won't happen the same.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  Great Cartoon!  Fits your tax Reform Bill For the Rich!
No it won’t, it’s trickle down economics and it has never worked, it raises the tax burden from the rich and leaves it on the rest of us
Lies, lies and more lies. That's the GOP never stop lying our voters will never check the facts. #dumpthegop
This WSJ article claims tax policy of 1960's created #jobs. That's when taxes were high and progressive! Tax cuts and #TaxReform of the '80s began the decline of the middle class and growth of the wealth divide. Tax cuts do not create jobs and good wages. #TickleDown
As long as these "workers" are CEOs
 seriously 
This #TaxReform will be a failure just like what happened in KS now the state is broke
GOOD Tax Reform. Not that shit you are proposing !!
Fake news on tax reform is BIGLY COVFEFE and as you can see Melina  knows its coming from the head white house moron. Trump taxes for RICH
What an utter lie. 30% will see a hike.
If anyone of you Republicans do not pass this tax cut you will be replaced. We the people are watching and taking names.
What Workers? #FeeltheHoodwink
The poor will pay 2% more and middle class 5% more under your plan...
QUIT LYING! This is all for the rich!
I just peed my pants 
Rich one yes Everybody else screw's
This is not true, per early analysis. Growth can't possibly be that strong. Only the rich are guaranteed breaks. Be honest.
Right. You mean it will give Senators a raise because it will encourage corporations to make huge donations to influence legislation.

Lies and the liars that tell these lies to rob Americans of the security of retirement by stealing their Medicare for corporate tax breaks
More Repugnican lies and B.S.!
GOP GAMEPLAN
Step 1: Cut taxes for 1%
Step 2: Dig huge $1.5T deficit hole
Step 3: Pay for it with benefit cuts to middle class
#TAXSCAM

The Top 1% get nearly 80% of the Trump tax cuts.  Top .1% get nearly 40% of the cuts. This is absurd. 
#TaxReform as proposed only gifts the billionaires

Reagan cut corporate taxes by 14% in '86. Here's what that did to avg. weekly wages:

1986—$285…
You've lost sight of the bigger picture, all of you.. your having the wrong conversations. @realDonaldTrump @EPAScottPruitt
SENATE REPUBLICANS : TAX CUTS, TAX REFORM : GET IT DONE, OR GET OUT.

The FY18 Budget gives $1.5TRIL in tax cuts to the richest Americans. It cuts about the same from Medicaid & Medicare. Whose side are you on? 
What will you do about this: Why you should be terrified about Trump and nukes http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/10/why-you-should-be-scared-about-trump-and-nuclear-weapons/ … via @MotherJones

A raise in what way exactly? You need to spell it out for us. We dont speak in forked tongue.
Spend your time impeaching trump or get ready to find new jobs
Your constituents are saying no to this tax scam that only benefits your rich campaign donors. Spend your time impeaching trump
I'm sure you would love that but my employer is the one who can raise my wages
This tax plan is dead
Also please see this historical chart showing how it really works

NO reform under a #puppetPOTUS. FIRST remove the traitors from power and the donor cash from politics. THEN reform appropriately.
an extra 1k a year for middle and low income families is not enough, while 80% of the tax cuts go to the wealthy. #TrickleDownDoesNotWork
LMOA. 99.9% of the savings from the @GOP & Trump's tax 'reform' will go to the wealthy!
How do we know that? You're not sharing your whole plan. Share all details including income brackets or go pound sand! Enough already!
