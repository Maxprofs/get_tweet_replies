the spy ship has 2 listen 2 something
Hah.  The spy ship left months ago.
if they were good spies I never would have known about it from hoosier land (: Sadly, fakenews, not Orangalago, informed us. Like usual.
The spy ship doesn't actually have spies; Fox got the first Pentagon leak, beating out the Free Beacon that covered the ship last time(2015)
Hoosier land? Indiana? You lost me
yes sir, Indiana.
Indiana notified you of the Russian ship?
The Spy Ship is a Russian Navy Auxiliary General Intelligence vessel, an AGI; it's "spying" in regards to doing military intelligence; recon
and? Is that OK with you? How about express an opinion about this fact you decided to post.
Will you be tuning in? Or are you already on their frequency?
What is wrong with you? You strip Americans of their rights, clean water & air, but you play host to Russian interference & corruption.
U disgust me and we will hold the Republican Party culpable for $elling our democracy! Russia only has pro Russian propaganda on their radio
Russian government takes over local DC Pennsylvania Avenue residence...and you are more concerned about the radio station?
#TownHallDodger
Russian KGB takes over republican party. National traitors.
This is NOT NORMAL!  Do something!
Why do you care? That's right, you don't 'cause they assisted the @GOP getting the White House & the Supreme Court.
If you think turning over your private voting data to this corrupt administration is a problem call the TX Sec of State now! 512-463-5770
If that mailbox is full, contact Keith Ingram, Director of Elections: (512) 463-9871
If that mailbox is full, contact anybody else in the Elections division. https://www.txdirectory.com/online/office/?id=6 …
They should be stopped.
Traitors
I'm sure this is fine with you.  Complicit.
And...? You're promoting this as a good thing?
Vote  @BetoORourke for Sen. 2018 in TX against Ted Cruz!!
Texans Deserve Better!
For Millions, Life Without Medicaid Services Is No Option
Blame Trump.
Do you favor, is this a show of solidarity with the President you appear to serve, serve over the needs of our nation?
Not a good thing nutjob John
Turnabout is fair play, as the saying goes.

You should be talking about California and Virginia not releasing voting records.I don't think Washington wants to see if illegals voting.
And the Presidency
Russian government takes over U.S. Election. Cornyn does jack shit.
That's nice. Now what are you going to do about it .@JohnCornyn? Or are you going to argue Putin has the same US freedoms as a USCitizen?
What's the difference? You are acting complicit w/all the strange connections to Russia and the WH. Kushner, Flynn, Page, Stone, Et al.
And everything else in DC

US Senators are pushing active measures to destroy our free press. 

Happy "Independence" Day, America. 

…
- Russia connections finally getting your attention? When will GOP take a stand on all this?
Where's your statement condemning the latest insane tweets from #CrookedLyingDonald? Oh, w/your head up his ass, you might have missed them
What is the GOP doing to ensure that the Russians do not meddle with our elections again? The Trump Admin is not doing anything. You need to
Should make the Trump administration feel at home. Maybe GOP congressional leaders will fainally take action against POTUS.
Your're ok with this?
I am more worried about Russian politicians taking over the Presidency, but you be you
russians own America due to you traitors, you dont even take senate intel cmte seriously - why you so worried now ? @Evan_McMullin @tedlieu
So, are u going to do something about it? U won't be judged 4 admitting u made a mistake. Get that orange shitgibbon out of our White House!
When will u man up (I know that's a difficult thing 4 u to do with yr lips attached to trump's ass) & realize Russia is taking over the USA
.@JohnCornyn And in other news Texas turns over voter info to the Feds http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/politics/texas/article/Texas-will-turnover-voter-data-to-Trump-commission-11259933.php …
Russian radio takes over local DC station http://thehill.com/homenews/media/340292-russian-radio-takes-over-local-dc-station#.WVefz59PSuI.twitter …
Fake News!  This is a CNN plot!  Hillary's emails!
Now @realDonaldTrump & Putin can both be whiny little bitches together.
Well that sounds appropriate given the situation! This is SO not right!!
And yet the House refuses to sign tough er sanctions against RU!!  GOP has no regard for country just lining pockets with lobbyists  Sad!
And I have yet to hear you publicly call on Trump to defend us against another attack in 18. Country before party!
How long before Trump hands over this data to Kislyac? Will they be in the oval office with Russian media?
And what are your views on this? #WeAreWatching
You know what would be really scary is if they did something in an election & some senator only asked about emails.
So when's the town hall John. And why aren't you doing something about all these russian takeovers and attacks? Why complicit in trumps crap
Please tell me you are NOT promoting this. You DO reallize that Russia is NOT our friend, right?
Are you happy with this, Senator?
What kind of tax breaks do you get by cutting care for people? Republicans own deaths panels. Creating and enforcing.
You and fellow republicans stop enabling Trump. This is also your fault as a party.
Why is this happening? Another gift from Trump.
Wonderful
They're taking over Washington so why not have their own radio station - as long as you stay in power. That's all you care about.
I am so tired of propaganda, yours and theirs.
Can't say I am surprised you knew that before the rest of us.
Congress ought write rules on foreign ownership of stations. or  apply some rules regarding sanctiond entities.
I can't tell by your tweet if this is acceptable to you. Will you side with the President and choose to ignore Russia's influence?
Yes, we all read that in our newsfeeds.  So what is your response to this? Just putting it out there w/ no respose is cowardly.
Figures.
Well, at least you'll have something to listen to while not doing your job.

Taunting your constituents again? Stay classy.
Are we supposed to cheer or fear? It's difficult to know what team you're on. TrumpCare is a tax cut. Nothing more. #worstsenatorinusa
you let this happen. and is tx giving voter info? or have we?I dont want mine given. I never give confidential info to people I don't trust
I thought, "Surely this is a headline from The Onion." Can't tell whether you're okay with this, though. Are you?
And also our White House and you don't seem to give a damn
What's your stance on this change? 
Jesus @POTUS do something about Russia!
lol
We can read headlines, thank you.
Your twitter feed is becoming more and more useless every day.
The Russian Whitehouse need a Russian radio station! Now trump won't have to go so far to chat with his friends!
Oh, now you're concerned about what the Russians take over?!
How did that happen, anyone in WH have stock in station @MSNBC @indivisibletxjc @PoliticalDiscor @IndivisibleTeam @nytimes
What is your opinion on this?  Hold a town hall and tell us.
Check out Trump's morning tweets.  Not one mention of this patriotic weekend.  He's insane. 25 amendment time!
And you're okay with this?
The Russians are now here to influence the American people in their favor... No need to hack anymore
have you talked to any of the 22,000,000 citizens that you propose to throw off health care?
This is dangerous for the American people
And??? You, yes you, are the government official with the supposed power & authority to do something about it. So, John, do something.

Trump is Making Russia Great Again
After being on the Trump train all this time, you are finally going to go the other way. Too late. We know where your loyalties have been.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT THIS?????????
This should not be allowed!   They're a hostile country that has attacked our democracy.  This is Russian state run broadcast of propaganda!
My God. You're announcing this as though you're celebrating it. What does that mean?
Whatcha gonna do about it??
And this upsets you.....why? Russia took over our govt before the last election......tweeted anything about that?
Whats ur point?
: unsure what your reaction is--is this good or bad?  Relative to Rusa visiting/influence in WH, is it better/worse?
Did DT suggest it?
So, when do you start working there?
And what are you doing about it?
So, do you think this is a good thing or a bad thing? We could discuss this at a town hall.
Russian puppet @realDonaldTrump president takes over United States, DC GOP eunuchs unwilling to act
Does that bother you Mr. Cornyn?  Sputnik = Putin propaganda
So are you saying you are also upset the Russians have hijacked the Republican party?
Ah! A new place to get your news @JohnCornyn.. How excited you must be.
Is this a statement?! I mean, you can't be shocked, surely!
Apparently we are supposed to give Russian state media a platform in the US? Reagan would be ashamed of this GOP.
Do not let them give our private information out! Secretary of state does not have my permission!
Sputnik. Donald's weekly address or however often he does them will be done from that radio station.     Trump radio
Is that what you are listening to on your drive in to "work"?  The Russia voting interference is a BIG deal!  Find a way to fix it!
Yes, disturbing isn't it? Also disturbing polls show R's now beginning to see Russia as an ally. This worries me a lot. You too?
Help me out, is this a good or a bad thing for you?

What are you doing to stop the Russian take over of your corrupt party?
It's almost as if they have friends in high places.
Are you bragging? It would make sense bc you've been doing your best to subvert the Russia investigation. You party over country disgrace.
Stop with the ignorant posts already. What is the point? You wanted them here, deal with it!
russians took over the white house, why is this so newsworthy to you? #PartyOverCountry #enabler

And I'm pretty sure WSJ is even one of Cornyn's preferred news sources. Maybe he'll tweet this one for us soon.
I'm surprised you care.  You back DJT on every issue!  You will regret that one day.

This is wild. The tax cuts 400 families get from the BCRA equals the Medicaid expansion for 700,000+ people. https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/26/15862002/tax-cuts-ahca-republican-health-plan …
