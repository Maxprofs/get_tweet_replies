So basically what you're saying is everyone should just roll over and accept dictats from on high without dissent @MediaKristina
no, I think he's saying you should pick the battles you can win instead of fighting everything.
See there's the problem - when you start using that logic, you start avoiding every battle @JohnCornyn @MediaKristina
Better than losing credibility and respect which will lose you everything...
In the grand scheme of things, the right is gonna be losing that far faster than the left @JohnCornyn @MediaKristina
You haven't been paying attention much have you?  The DNCs had there largest loss in decades...
You haven't been paying attention have you - right is scared the allegations abt Putinia are true @JohnCornyn @MediaKristina
No one even believes that propoganda.  No evidence. Innocent until proven, sorry.  Too many lies..
come on Senator most of us remember your record on delay and knuckle-dragging
Cassandra Butts died while you delayed. Hopefully millions won't when you delay on Healthcare.
Let's not exaggerate here. How many died because they couldn't afford the care that's affordable?
that's a great question! How many Americans have. Dies over the decades without insurance?
Obamacare can Never fix that! Thats why it won't work! Healthcare cost & knowone wants to pay.
Blame that one. REPS, AND DEMS  playing to big Pharma.and insurance companies that lobbied and lined their pockets
There were no republicans who voted on that bill, it was a party line vote.

I didn't know obsequious cowering to the inevitable was a Texan trait. Curious. @MediaKristina
neither is fighting a fight you know you can't win.
I'll just take this opportunity to remind you: SCOTUS seat. You forgot sauce for the goose. Welcome to the world you created
maybe Cornyn should remember that when he thinks of Repub. obstruction during Obama years. hypocrite!!
OK, just show respect for the democratic process.  The campaign is over.  Pompeo is great and democracy is also!
Whats the deal here?  Rep own the majority so a vote doesn't mean anything
IT WASN'T DELAY AND FOOT-DRAGGING.  IT WAS THE PROPER DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURE FOR CONFIRMING CABINET MEMBERS.
@KellyannePolls again false facts = lies more than a 1/3 of Trumps cabinet haven't even submitted proper docs. Unprepared pres
Senator Cornyn, please approve 100% of POTUS' Cabinet Nominees next week. Stop the DEMS from delaying..please.
We're going to impeach Trump. Then will be coming for 4 u & the rest of the gerrymanderer's. We know.
are you implying that expressing the wishes of your constituents is a waste of time if they are against the majority?
- John - It's called "advice and consent" Delay and foot dragging is when you just refuse to do your job.
John, the obstructionists can't stop Trump but they can temporarily hobble him. Thank God we have a majority.
@KellyannePolls um, so you think no one should ever question any thing Dear Leader does?
@RanaeMayle He just waited them out. Patience is a virtue after all remember that my fellow Americans.
How can you complain about delay when you refused to vote on Merrick Garland for the empty SCOTUS seat?!?!
Because it was HIS right & duty! No MORE COMMIES ON SCOTUS! @JohnCornyn
we can make an exception for uncle Putie right?
Gadget perfect name 4 one who believes LYING #CNN! #ByeFelicia @JohnCornyn
@KellyannePolls 
We just love to see you whine about nothing to Chuck Todd. You don't stand a chance with the media
Terrific! Time to expand the security state, reopen black sites, and torture people. I- for one- am just PSYCHED
@KellyannePolls it's also duly noted for the next elections 2018
in other words, "naa naa a boo boo?"
Agree 100%
Air time and dirt. Noting different than the last 6 years. Pay back. More coming.
January 5, 2009, Obama nominated Panetta.  February 12, 2009, Panetta confirmed.  Seems Pompeo was on fast track
Merrick Garland?@KellyannePolls
@KellyannePolls Don't know either but maybe we should ask Judge Garland about his nomination. Nevermind it already expired.
@KellyannePolls ethics and paperwork. Rules and regulations for a reason.
@KellyannePolls Just liberals showing their supporters that they will be nasty and divisive which gets them elected. .
@KellyannePolls Why do you show such disdain for following the rights of an officials questioning appointees?
They are still waking up one by one  from deep slumber to a new GOP world  of action by Trump.
@KellyannePolls liar
it's called vetting. I know you aren't familiar with that concept
@KellyannePolls You don't understand government process and requirements of nominees..WH waited far too long to provide docs
Hum. What are the purposes of delay Republican Senator?
Soon we must entertain the serious question, "Just who are these people, claiming to be democrats?" Our Nation depends on it.
Right.  Vetting people is SUCH a waste of time.  Europe is laughing at you.

Waiting for Jeff Sessions

DOJ is a very SICK department

Needs radical PURGING
@KellyannePolls at least we tried
My SENATOR, Please get the rest of President Trumps Cabinet approved. What's the holdup?
It's called due diligence! What u r talking about is what Repubs did to our SC pick, Garland! #HypocrisyGoneWild
Changed nothing but it made them feel like they have some sort of power which they do not! Kindergarten play!
posturing and nitpicking by lost swamp organisms
yep, these unhinged leftists can't cope, can't deal w/ the real world as it actually exists. Temper tantrums feel good, do nada.
called Schumer
It showed us that the Dems are petty obstructionists.
wish we could say the same about your refusal to move forward with a Supreme Court Justice.
Pompeo says "Please Ignore the earth quacks in Oklahoma that I have caused"
way to heal the division Kellyanne. You complain about it nonstop yet perpetrate it more than anyone else
It's called democracy. Stop your whining and start respecting all of your constituents.
Why are you and @SenateMajLdr delaying Sessions, Tilleson, Perry?  We Texans know how sneaky you Tom Donohue loyalists are.
Maybe it gave everyone the chance to ask their questions, listen to the answers, then cast an informed vote
It allows American citizens to know what these nominees' records look like. Isn't that what Republicans did to Obama's nominees.
Then why are you delaying Sessions, Tilleson, Perry?  Yes you and @SenateMajLdr expediting ONLY GOPe cabinet?
way to call out the bs by the loser dems
except notifying the Am. People that we need to watch our backs with this man.
@KellyannePolls Alternative facts are the new republican way so I'm guessing......hummm yeah that !
@RanaeMayle Maybe if had been at CIA on Sat Trump wouldn't have embarrassed himself. Move on Dems.
He may not have had the proper clearance to be at the CIA. I'm thinking anyway.  Many nominees don't have clearances
They r ignoring the county's safety.Trump moves at warp speed and they are on the manana schedule.  Perhaps they can't keep up!
#ISmellARat
Lemme tell ya...  I think there is something going on behind the scenes.  Like tying up loose ends.  Obama just dumped Bunch of moneytoo.
I think it's just a lot of democrats acting like children.  Like skipping the inauguration.
@KellyannePolls Another BIG #WIN to ##MAGA
there is a reason no tax returns will ever be seen....
so welcome back torture, add to it no freedom of the press, $$$$$for big companies, Trump in putins pocket....
@KellyannePolls 32 no about is pretty significant John
@KellyannePolls #ItsTheProcessStupid
Get the TV cameras out of the hearings and the time will be cut by 90%
.@JohnCornyn  Your words are not befitting the office you hold. Childish.
It showed us who sold us all out. Thanks for making your allegiance very clear.
Schumer's dragging because his diaper is loaded.
Time for @Potus to visit the @TheJusticeDept kick it up a bit n see what these folks can spill. Sounds like a great idea @Reince
it may have allowed some of the weasel scum to slip away we will have to redouble our efforts is all. this stall is 4 a reason$$
my Daddy said "It's always wise to look before you leap"
Made the #democrates feel relevant #Trump
Are you Gloating, or Shaming, or just Rude? All of above, You didn't learn anything in Kindergarten either. ICKY
It's called democracy
stay off Native American Land! That is a sovereign nation and the fight will be even larger this time!!
Hey Mr.Cornyn, when do we get a chance to learn "pussy grabbing"? Is your church doing it now? Pls let us know..
it is called confirmation hearings has been done forever we have democracy still dont we
Wow gracious much?  How about how nice to see Pompeo confirmed. #dontaskquestionsjustdoit
well it changed my opinion of the GOP down a notch.
It showed Schumer and his merry band are wasting everyones time.
@KellyannePolls What a shock "man" from Texas doesn't get how America works.
Agreed, the Naysayers will continue to drag feet & have their meltdowns because eating crow for 19 months is making them sick!
thank John for ur service as always we have ur back here in Texas.
putting things on the record? #Obvious
Don't forget, employees hired last 8 yrs. have loyalty to outgoing Admin. which hired them & not to Pres. Trump.
I still think employees hired last 8 yrs. will have to be dismissed to get rid of intel leakers & create loyalty
If your nominees had finished their ethics reports it wouldn't have been necessary.  Shame on you for not caring more.
@TheDemocrats were able soil themselves & spout bullshit to soothe their hypocritical delicate psyches...
Republicans don't care about us. They only care about them and what they can gain. Republicans have no hearts.
@KellyannePolls Good news! He will kick some extremist ass! We can save money by unleashing our prison population on isis!
just getting all the information to make informed decision is all
@KellyannePolls I suggest you both try it for once.
Dems have every right to delay. It is how democracy works. And the nominees are DEPLORABLES. Remember the repugnicans did the same to Obama.
@KellyannePolls Well, it worked for you guys. Expect more of the same. It's nice to see obstruction on the side of Good finally.
Demos still want to pout about Hillary.They need to work w/Trump so we can make USA better. That is their job.
@KellyannePolls Pissed a lot of sane people off.
Now Tillerson needs to be confirmed!
@KellyannePolls I'm one of your constituents and wonder how u have the nerve to talk about "foot dragging." Cong. 15% approval?
@KellyannePolls 1st time some1 in the WH that's not controlled by special interest or the establishment! Trump is for the people
Many nominees have BIG ethical issues and/orr refuse to answer questions-not foot dragging
If these nominees had arrived prepared with documents needed - he wouldn't have a problem.
Should have gotten all your ducks in a row before going to committee. Paper work, ethics questions too tough?
Delay & foot-dragging gave the people who wanted more information time to get the info. It showed respect 2 them
@curtismuddog I wouldn't say it didn't change anything; it lowered our National Security Readiness.
@KellyannePolls it alerted the public what his agenda is. We kniw what to watch for. What to hold him accountable for.
Sir, the Democratic socialistic "progressive" party is out to destroy USA. Obama will be back soon as the leader
come on.. somebody got something over the weekend. We just don't know what it was.
Well of course they had to crawl out of their safe spaces first and put on a safety pin..
Delay and foot-dragging gave time for Americans to see awful nominations from failing @realDonaldTrump
And what did it cost us? Nothing. I thought y'all were going to be all about winning, not whining. #GOPSnowflake
@KellyannePolls Hold @chuckschumer accountable for his little games.
I am surprised by hypocrisy in this statement. Ur constituents are urging u 2 do better and u r ignoring us. This will backfire.
.@JohnCornyn Not much, since Senate doesn't care about proper vetting and disclosure of conflicts of interest.
Some Representatives and Senators consciences were bothering them not yours though! You are happy to #putspecialinterestsfirst
Foot dragging? I'd call it in depth investigation and vetting of a man who is being installed in an extremely powerful job.
@KellyannePolls Absolutely right. It doesn't seem to matter how many questions or concerns are raised about any of these picks
#childlikepetulance
Voters will remember next time these sore losers are up for re-election.  They STILL haven't learned!
it was @ChuckSchumer's political stunt and it failed!
Mazel Tov!
wrong... it was another demonstration that the Democrats are the obstructionist, as was Harry Reid holding up bills!
, 7 confirmed on Obama 1st day,all w/n the week. Demmos r spoilt children, that need Pompeo's hand of discipline & redirecting!
32 #Communists voted against him. #UniteAndFight
#SupremeCourt
@KellyannePolls It's called democracy, you traitors.
HOPE IT TAKES AS LONG AS IT DID FOR REPUBLICANS TO VOTE ON OBAMA SUPREME COURT PICK!!!
@KellyannePolls  By asking the right questions it allowed the public to see the kind of ppl republicans would push through.
.@JohnCornyn What a hypocrite your are? Forget you failed your duty and didn't even have hearings on Garland? Stop being an arrogant fool.
You mean like the last 4 years?  Your boss is a fool.
didn't change a thing just let a few left wing liberals throw their fits and think they were important for a minute
@KellyannePolls The delay and foot dragging is letting the American people see the hugely dubious character of these nominees.
and the rest?
More Republican voters! We see what the democrats are doing! Remind them next election!
@KellyannePolls
define "change": Raising awareness that the CIA chief supports torture, violations of international law is important, no?
Slow confirmation to derail 100 day goals?
I guess you have it figured out then. What matter what's right or what the people want, if you know you'll win the vote. Fuckem?
@KellyannePolls Schumer picked on the wrong man!
It was just another nail in the Democrat's coffin
@joyceblake then why all the whining
@SenSchumer  the drag your feet strategy is hurting America and the democratic party
I'd call it proper vetting and questioning, not delay and knuckle dragging. Americans deserve fully vetted cabinet.
I guess the GOP is now opposed to delay and foot dragging? @JohnCornyn This need for speed noticeably absent during Obama's administration.
@KellyannePolls It got his answers to critical questions on record so he can be held accountable by we the people. Longer confir
Exposed Pompeo's agenda. Always good, Svetlana CONway.
@KellyannePolls - at least someone is trying to stop the shitstorm you fool.
.....and what did 8 years of "obstruction and footdragging" do for America when the GOP did it to President Obama....NOTHING
@Rockprincess818 The way for the jack asses 2 get noticed, remember they are fragile/sick human beings very needy self doubters.
just showed that Schumer is a hack...
It's the democratic process that Makes America Great NOW!
???  Seems like the lying bully ass kissers did this for 8 years
@KellyannePolls When are we going to get that oil out of the Middle East? I paid way too much for gas yesterday.
Senator, I beg you, don't let them hold us up. Vote Tillerson and others soon! We cannot tolerate this crap from @TheDemocrats
@KellyannePolls Gave the Dems "appearance" to their base, that they were fighting and had actual power. COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!!
They delayed to do their job and due dilligence, it was the same thing republicans did when Obama entered...
office. As members of congress it is their job to vet each candidate...
Wouldn't be so sure, but next to impossible to prove (because of cloak of secrecy on almost everything)!
Don't you support  due diligence in decision-making John? Your constituents expect it.
@veteranstake it changed nothing but confirmed the dems are the party of destruction and hate! Didn't work for obama wont wk now
Why are you shutting down to go on a retreat? You have work to do in DC that is important.
@KellyannePolls Let's hope for these numbers with SCOTUS picks (note plural)
Isn't that what you guys did to Merrick Garland?
@KellyannePolls Democrats dragging that ass
@KellyannePolls the establishment playing games.
@KellyannePolls Actually it caused a national security risk!
Trump lowest an incoming presidential approval 45% first time a pres received approval rating under 50%
@KellyannePolls abstruct abstruct abstruct says the left!
Proper due diligence = deliberate & ethical process & not "good ole boy" process that u r used to. #RednecksBS
Actually, once again, the foot dragging informed us of exactly who the Democrats are.  Never Forget.
@NewEra17Michael Liberals = Misery

Really disgraceful by @SenSchumer

@suzydymna it's just the stupid and pathetic left putting our countries safety at risk delaying these confirmations #morons
@KellyannePolls How many lives could have been saved if we dragged our feet instead of running into Iraq? #makeamericatrumpless
Just more grandstanding
@KellyannePolls
The crazy left and fake news Will be disappearing hopefully soon
What else do Democrats have? Well, caterwauling and teeth gnashing, of course
@RobertTGarrett Hardly a big delay. And it's important to give time for vetting and public understanding.
It made known that we won't sit by idly and kiss your ass!
He was confirmed as fast as any other CIA Director. Maybe if he didn't lie about waterboarding?
Dems are just using the GOP play book.
