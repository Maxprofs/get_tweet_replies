We have radically different definitions of 'bailout.' To me, allowing insurance companies to deny any coverage they want is a bailout.
Funding CSRs is a temporary measure till markets are stabilized... not a bailout.
How can that happen when we control the senate?
John. You and your senate colleagues are a disappointment. Nothing but talk. I pray that you are defeated when you run again.
He means continuing CSR payments, IE faithfully executing the laws of the land.

Why not a GOP attempt to fix ACA
No bailout of Ins Cos.....
Rescue Needy Americans and their Wellbeing
Wouldn't the Democrats need the Republicans to get anything passed? So, you are afraid of your own party, not the dems.
Oh mother tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun
John Cornyn demonstrates with every passing day how out of touch with, and indifferent to, the needs and wishes of his constituents he is.
On ACA @JohnCornyn is simply repeating the establishment GOP's message. He thinks we're too stupid to understand. He'll lie to us later.
Like McConnell, #1 russian supporter, you too can lie and keep a straight face. You go there as fast for lying as you do for stealing.
bleh!  YOU FAILED!!!!  enough with the inane propaganda already Johnny!
Can Comrade Cornyn read?
If you call #MedicareForAll bailing out insurance companies...
John's had nearly a decade to figure out something, but he's perfectly content ignoring his constituents to give his buddies Medicaid money.
Apparently Republicans still haven't learned that the democrats in congress are their coworkers, NOT THEIR ENEMIES. Stop subverting them!
OMG we not baling out the Koch Brothers
Even if he votes for it, if repeal fails @JohnCornyn as a member of GOP "leadership" is responsible for failing to do as they have promised!
No bailouts!!!! These companies have too much money and power as is! No taxpayer dollars should pad their wallets! #FullRepeal
-I'd love to see Ds and Rs work together for the good of the American people. Novel concept?
Why aren't you furious with your president for putting you in this mess in the first place? He makes all y'all look like fools.

You could compile an amazing list of all the times Cornyn was obviously, publicly out of the loop. McConnell doesn't trust anyone. 24/
Senator, I guess you mean the Democrats will actually try to do something for the American people, instead of throwing us under the bus
Cornyn is really reaching now...
Here is input from former insurance executive:

It's worth reading.
Texas deserves better

that's BS, it would be the REPUG MAFIA wanting to bail them out! they don't need bailing out, they need to not pay millions to their CEO's!!
Part of y he lost my vote. He puts wealthy donors above the poor and sick of this great state. Jesus would be sad.
Or...the Republicans could actually work to FIX it to where we have a good system.
Nope.  We want single pyr. How is that a corp bailout?  Quit lying to people.   You guys have no plan other than erase Obama.  “Sad!”
Cornyn is souless. I don't know how you sleep. You are causing many restless nights for everyone else. 2020 is coming.
Damn John, you and your slacker friends had 7 years to do something, how does it feel to be caught with your pants down?
Proof of republicans refusal to work to make ACA better because #cowardcornyn and his #PartyOfLiars wants to kill Medicare and SS #TRAITORS
#cowardcornyn works for corporate lobbyists not the people. He like his party doesn't give a damn about Americans. He won't work with Dems

No deal
Hey john! Looks the only real nothing-burger this week was your heath care plan! Bon appetit!!!
Adhering to ACA is not "bailing out". It is stabilizing the market that was promised to people. Quit lying!!!
Oh, dear, @JohnCornyn.You had one job. As Senate Majority Leader, you have to herd your party to vote the way you, @SenMcConnell and @POTUS
want a vote to go. You have the ability, but, apparently, lack the competence to count to 51. (And don't give us any bs about McCain being
unable to vote- you were screwed to get past 48 without him. Keep on keeping on, @JohnCornyn. You and @KenPaxton are prime examples of why
we need to keep Texas Attorneys General out of Federal public office. Hugs & kisses, Jay.
Define wealthy by income level. Otherwise it's just a sound bite
#NeverRepeal
The senior Senator could team up with Democrats and improves/stabilize the ACA right now. Let us count the ways: http://acasignups.net/17/07/18/updated-if-i-ran-zoo-20-repairsimprovements-obamacare-20 …
It's like the Republicans are running out of "Obama sucks" soundbites and are grasping at straws at this point.
Why would Democrats bail out insurance companies that are currently experiencing record stock prices?
If Cornyn wasn't such an ineffective whip they wouldn't be in this mess. He's got only himself to blame.
@JohnCornyn then get it done
If John or Ted and the rest of GOP had any integrity, they would ask 45 for HIS plan. But no, they'll just take the insults.
No bail out . The GOP will lose bad on 2018
Maj ur constituents hav been askg you to work w/Demos to improve ACA.Amer are tired of http://partisanship.Work  together
No, that's the GOP bill, but I understand your confusion.
The fault is all republicans for always putting party over country. You don't care who gets hurt as long as you get a "win." Shameful.

The same way Obama had to bailout Republican banks, insurance companies, and auto makers?  Johnny just doesn't want to give the $180K back!!

Patients & families rightly expect Republican leaders to clean up their mess & Dems are at the table when they are ready to actually govern. https://twitter.com/PattyMurray/status/887382133991501824 …

Why did he vote for repeal in 15?! #RINO #NotConservative

Proud to join Democratic & Republican governors from across the country to call for a new, bipartisan approach to fix our healthcare system. 

Now is not the time to double-down on the same failed tactics that got us here—@SenateGOP should finally give bipartisan solutions a chance
7 years and @JohnCornyn couldn't come up with anything?  SEVEN YEARS! 

Mitch McConnell now wants a straight ACA repeal. Here's what that would do (RT widely) 
Oh God...bipartisanship. #countryfirst

Text RESIST to 50409 for fast easy way to fax Senators & Reps to VOTE NO TO #BCRA. Time is running out to stop this genocidal bill. PLS RT!
Right, he's addicted to Koch. Bad addiction, like free basing Koch all day addiction.
Single payor bails the public out from the profits of the defunct insurance companies.
