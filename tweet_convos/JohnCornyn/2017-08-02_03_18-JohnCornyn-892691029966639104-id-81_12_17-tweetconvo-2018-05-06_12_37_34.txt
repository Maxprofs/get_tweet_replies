You are supporting the systematic destruction of our democracy. Anything you have to say is irrelevant noise. Delete your account. #2020
John Cornyn continues to fund planned parenthood but talks of abortion - not a conservative. His buddies Jeff Flake and McCain
Worry about your own party. What have Reps done for Americans in last 8 years? What have you done for Texans? #peoplenotparty
Please don't do this. I'm trying to hang onto being a Republican. You are making it hard for me.
John, can't you use your own words rather than plagiarizing others? Who writes your tweets?
How's your healthcare bill coming?
Abortion shouldn't even be a political issue.
Why the F would you care about this? Supporting abortion now?
Just the opposite:  Republicans' litmus test is anti choice. Dems aren't for abortion. Who wants to have one?  Not one woman I know.
Yes not a question of pro-abortion. Need to chge the conversation. Need to be Pro Birth Control and sex ed to reduce need for abortion.
Men have no busines making decisions about our body. Just try to oppress womn.U don't even want us to have birthcontrol
Lindsey West's article in @nytimes states BOGUS STATISTIC:70% of people are OK w/abortion...maybe in her state but NOT IN middle America!!
When will men realize they don't have a say about what happens in a uterus? I don't have a say about what happens in a prostate.
Your campaigning ? You should be voted out
Getting government & other people's religion out of people's businezz should be the gop litmus but it's not. No one is pro-abortio John.
"I will continue to prostate myself to get big-money donations from corporate & religious donors." How's that for a litmus test for Rs?
You tweeted any article based on its title alone. As I would say to a child, read the book before you judge the cover.
I agree. Access to safe abortion & Supreme Court were my two highest priorities in '16, followed by climate change.
Just as failure to repeal ACA is litmus test for you/Senate. You failed.We will http://remember.How  can we not?Paying$1796/mo & no care

POINT 7: CBO lays blame for the insurer exit largely with Trump.   In fact... 12 
Glad you think that Dem should run on body autonomy promises! #AreYouUnderstandingIt #BroDoYouEvenRead #turnTexasBlue #resist
As it should be because it is about more. Women and their doctors should make their own decisions without government interference. Period.
Abortion shouldn't be a political test at all. SCOTUS made it *legal* - quit trying to make it illegal! Women an choose for themselves.
Yes, it should. No one should run for office who believes that there are no human beings, only cows.
How's that maternity mortality rate going in Texas?
One issue to divide
Actually, politicians should get out of the abortions.  It is a religious question not a political question. Women need to figure this out.

We find no evidence of the individual market collapsing. Rather, insurers on track to have best year since ACA began http://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/individual-insurance-market-performance-in-early-2017/ … 
Of course denying healthcare to millions of Americans and suppressing women's right to choice should be a Litmus Test for Republicans.
Did you read the article? Bless your heart.
you should talk to women who've had an abortion to understand why...as opposed to judging from the sidelines. Tick tock
There should also be a litmus test for having a brain to be POTUS
One party has to give a shit about the rights and self governance of women.  It ain't going to be yours.
Reproductive rights are human rights. Republicans don't care about life, just control.
john, you tweet articles that you think prove your point. They don't. Are you really an undercover liberal?
I am a dem and do not believe in abortions but believe that women have the right to choose for themselves.
Great job whip
Your view of the Commandments is simple minded. Read the Catechism of the Catholic Church or something else that explains them to adults
Right! Bc bodily autonomy & support for maternal health, sensible sex education, & family policies like paid leave r core Democratic values.
Of course your litmus test should be...death for your healthcare coverage. The just die already mantra. #cornygoals
Of course cluster bombing Yemen should be a litmus test for... everyone
yes that type of killing is wrong; but killing by taking away healthcare and benefits from poor, poisoning our air/water is perfectly fine.
I think it's time to ask: "can John cornyn read?"
Time to work with the democrats on healthcare.  Fix it. Don't let the rich rob everyone else.  The silent majority vote in numbers!
So, I totally disagree, John. You should really get to know your co stituents instead of firing off tweets from your bully pulpit.
If we had our way, it would be to pour money into research for a male form of birth control, John. Not ED, like you men so love.
And we're an open and willing nonprofit that can identify good research to fund. Just sayin'.
Single issue voting is bad for the country.
It is the woman who should be able to make these decisions, unencumbered. And I guarantee you-abortion is not the first on the list.
Makes it inevitable that young women get pregnant.    Who wants to have a rapists' baby?  Why are men making these decisions?
But, Republican fake Christians' refusal to teach about birth control, pay for birth control, give out free birth control to poor areas
It sure as shit wasn't for your President and his party.
"...the abattoir of clown meat whose top policy priority seems to be “poor people deserve to die of preventable diseases”?" Hey, that's you!
Aren't you embarrassed with the so-called leader we have right now? If you are not and there's something wrong. A damn psycho Circus. SAD
The best way to rebuild the Democratic Party is on a Cruise Ship leaving America with no Port of Calls!
It SHOULDNT be a POLITICAL issue! It's fundamentally a personal choice which has been tainted by nonsensical religion. church /= state
I don't think Cornyn read the article.
The Litmus test should be compassion. Something you know nothing about.
Replutocrats have strayed so far from conservative values that they couldn't win a seat if not for wedge issues. That's why you want them.
Dems will not win by courting your staunchest voters.
Your litmus test? Blatant propaganda, extreme partisan biases, cherry picked facts..& when cornered...cheats & lies #TrumpRussiaCollusion
Your litmus test? Blatant propaganda, cherry picked facts, partisan extremism...& when that fails.. lie & cheat #TrumpRussiaCollusion
Your party is more than happy to insert itself into a stranger's uterus. Explain why YOU don't believe in body autonomy.
says john cornyn. well, shoot, i'll just have to take your word as gospel. NO! of course it isn't. speaking in absolutes is...well...you.
Can be peronally anti-abortion&still be pro-choice policy-wise As long as u don't LEGISLATE your opinion Remember Republs r against big Govt
YES
Of course John Cornyn tries to deflect from his own party"s shortcomings.
Now the White House is not good enough for your president Its a real dump cause a black family lived there
Guard the unborn fetus a when they are born with health  issues rage they are takers and try to take healthcare away
Dems will run on anti-abortion stance to get elected then once in office do the opposite. Kinda like Republicans on Obamacare
New flash you religious nut bag, STAY OUT FROM BETWEEN WOMENS LEGS. #WOMENSRIGHTS
Litmus  tests,  really? These are people's lives.  When will Congress realize their decisions affect lives????
