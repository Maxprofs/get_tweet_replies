Giving credit where credit is due, giving tax credits to Americans under 100%FPL to buy insurance is a good thing about #BCRA
It gives poor Americans the freedom to choose between Medicaid and subsidies private coverage (except in Texas & 18 other states)
But the @SenateGOP & @HouseGOP should nix the repeal of ACA's Net Investment Tax. It would save $172B to use for better purposes.
Like restoring CSRs for moderate income Americans - which cost $105B - and help patients pay for copays & deductibles.
And adding CSRs for low income Americans who you now have given tax credits to buy private coverage. Without it, how do you think...
...people under the poverty level can pay for their deductibles? Use the remaining $67B on that please.
Now, there is no reason to decimate #Medicaid unnecessarily. Block grants are just too austere. Per capita caps are a better option.
I could live with per capita caps if pegged to CPI-M (not CPI-U) if you want to put #Medicaid on a predictable budget.
Define good
hope they shared with you how destabilizing this uncertainty is to patient care
Who are your damn constituents  cornyn?
When do your constituents get to talk to you?  You next town hall meeting is scheduled for...???
I sincerely pray u r considering a fix 2 the ACA so we don't lose rural healthcare

Too bad you couldn't meet with the people who NEED healthcare. Instead, you meet with those who profit from it. #profitTrumps
Like your constituents Texans. Please help us. How rich enough is rich enough?
Did you listen? Because I don't feel like you've been listening to our concerns at all.
I don't he listened because @texashospitals is opposed to Medicaid cuts and less insurance coverage. http://www.tha.org/Public-Policy/Newsroom/THA-Statement-on-US-Senates-ACA-Repeal-Bill …
*I don't think he listened
At this point it's just like talking at a brick wall. Pretty sure any hospital-based system won't have good things to say about BCRA.
Pls choose human life over greed- disabled kids rely on an optional state #Medicaid program to keep them alive & cared for at home

Senate health bill puts many moms and babies at risk, says March of Dimes president. http://to.pbs.org/2tdF0f4 
Heard McAllen gave Cruz a rude awakening about healthcare from GOP. Texas can do better than Cornyn and Cruz.
Town hall?
Your actions in Washington prove you're a corrupt politician, @JohnCornyn !
And I'm sure the hospital mentioned how horrible the senate's bill is
I do not believe your lies. 1,218 days until I can vote against you.
These are lobbyists for groups of people who help a lot of us but also profit off health care. Did you talk to any families w/ sick kids?
O please! you don't now, nor have you ever, cared about the health of your Texas constituents #stop #noTrumpcare
Did they tell you what garbage your plan is?
Hope you listened when they told you the Medicaid cuts would be a disaster. http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/17/520266060/texas-braces-for-medicaid-cuts-under-gop-health-plan …
Not sure how tax cuts for the wealthy will improve healthcare for most Texans, but okay!  #SinglePayerNow
Does improving mean affordable for low income Texans? Women? Preexisting conditions? What does it mean?
I'm guessing they didn't support the latest push to end Medicaid entirely.
When r you having some real town hall meetings with your constituents
@JoeNBC @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @GOP @RepKevinBrady @POTUS @realDonaldTrump   I can't wait to see the roadshow coming to a town hall meeting!
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/01/health/for-millions-life-without-medicaid-services-is-no-option.html?_r=0 … This is who you are killing with your dishonestly and cruelly named "better" care. #WorthlessSycophant
...and they said?
Could you explain it us? How about holding a town hall?
Why won't you visit Victor?
Cornyn and Cruz refuse to meet with Victor and his mom Laura. #SaveMedicaid @ProtectingAmer1 @indivisibleATX @MSNBC  https://youtu.be/ZgNg0hiCYqQ 
As a member of the TMA, I know @texmed doesn't support BCRA. Did you LISTEN to docs on the ground or only the industries lining your pocket?
Can you actually talk to the patients? When will you hold a town hall?
Still no town halls to hear from your constituents, remember, the people you're supposed to be serving?
Great! When's your town hall being held?
More horse shit from out of touch Senator. GOP promise #FullRepeal , hopefully your better healthcare horse shit will get filibustered. 
hospital associations oppose BCRA, but u keep spinning! causes rural hospitals to close, costs jobs!!
what a crock! Only 12% of Americans believe you & that doesn't seem to matter! Insurance company $ wins!
So when are you holding a town hall in Austin so you can meet with your constituents.  You work for us.  Time to listen to our concerns.
John Cornyn is hiding in plain sight again.
Yes, and the AHA & FAH along with over 50 major patient advocacy groups OPPOSE your GOP wealthcare bill. What does that say?
I'm not a Democrat.  But the GOP has done such an amazing job of pissing off America that I'm going to be stuck with Democrats forever.
Trumpcare is the GOP's signed confession that the poor & elderly are irrelevant to them.  Did you have to apologize for POTUS again?
Why didn't you just talk to the billionaires who are getting the $1 Trillion tax cut so they can buy an extra yacht?
Didn't know that you were a priest with authority to give the last rites.
Why don't you share with the rest of us at #townhall How long will you continue to ignore your constituents? #TownHallDodger
What happened to buying insurance across state lines?
When and where will you hold town hall meetings during the fourth?
How abt stealing the voters information  have you talked abt that ?
Why are you not doing a town hall meeting on healthcare with your constituents before you vote on the bill?  I think we know the answer why!
Bahahaha the only #Texan that liked it was the one who did not read it! Must be your story as well. #colludingcornyn
How very @GOP of you to speak with the lobbyists protecting their interests! Now let us speak with you so we can tell you what we need!

Research has found that #Medicaid expansions for adults were associated with reductions in mortality. http://kaiserf.am/2tiGdQF  
Bull
Were any of them 50-65 year olds that are about to be charged FIVE times more?  Just curious. #TrumpcareKills
Funny you are doing that while pushing to destroy our healthcare. Try listening to us with a town hall.
Did you listen, or just GOPsplain to them how your bill is great?
Want better healthcare? Get Government out of it!
(the ones who have the money...)
But you u still want to take away their health insurancrooked.....hypocrite
Expand Medicare?
How do you call yourself a #CompassionateConservative or #ProLife and defend such a callous bill intended to #PaybackYourDonors?
Stop pandering to the rich and do what's right for the people you represent.
Christians don't take health care away from 22 million of Americans
"Good visit" - you're even sounding like Trump now. Throw in "free market insurance" you can sound like Pence. Their stench will last.
How does doing away with #subsidies and taking away #protections allow single income homes get "access" to HC when they have low wages??
How does allowing @GovAbbott to limit #EssentialBenefits and bring back #CatastrophicPlans help #WorkingPoor with a #cancer diagnosis?
How do #TaxCuts for #InsuranceExecutives & companies help average Texans with premiums?
What about #BCRA helps #RuralTexans? #Women? #Elderly? #WorkingPoor?
How will you improve healthcare and reduce premiums without raising deductibles for those of us over 50?
#Townhall 

Why do I get charged more simply for being born female? 

When is it ok to cap my son's insurance due 2 #PreExistingCondition?
So are you going to vote that all Texans are provided healthcare or are you going to insure your constituents are at risk?
But no townhall! Maj Whip in Senate afraid to be whipped in a townhall performance & GOP policy review.
How many actual patients did you speak with? And since you are in Houston, why not have a town hall?  I'll bring snacks.
We want a town hall.
You just don't get it
you do realize that NOT ONE medical group supports the GOP proposal ? that ACA is against it as it breaks the Hippocratic Oath  @TXDemWomen
@texashospitals opposes #BCRA. What did @texmed have to say? Visiting and listening are two different processes. You don't seem to listen.
Still no townhall and the bill you crafted in secret will not give #BetterCare
more meetings??? why...pass legislation to repeal and replace....gop governance is in question if cant pass hcare legislation.
Which part did they like most, John? The one where you want to kick 22 million off insurance or gutting support for Medicaid?
Did you discuss how you and the TX R government have worked to destroy Obamacare for politics.  Have a town hall and hear how much we care
As we hope they told you directly, neither @texashospitals nor @texmed support the Senate bill. See attached and see http://www.tha.org/Public-Policy/Newsroom/THA-Statement-on-US-Senates-ACA-Repeal-Bill …
...and from @texmed:
Let's be sure to include #mentalhealth in the discussions!  Texas has a pathetic track record ranked 49th in the USA!!!
"Better Care"? lol Don't piss on my boot and tell me it's raining.#WorthlessSycophant #Liar
Would rural Texas be any different under Cornyn"Care"?
I cannot imagine that they support this disgrace of a bill but I have stopped expecting empathy from our politicians and big medicine in TX
Dude my comment to a comment has a better ratio then your original tweet. Maybe get the message everyone hates this tax cut for the wealthy
You know how devastating #trumpcare would be to rural TX hospitals and nursing homes, right? #BCRA helps millionaires, hurts everyone else.
These guys? They don't like your plan. #SavetheACA #MedicareForAll #SaveMedicaid
Like not taking away health insurance? And treating women like people? You should maybe do those things.
Daily reminder @johncornyn + @tedcruz #RESIGN u r doing NOTHING for the AMERICAN PEOPLE Only for YOUR POCKETBOOK don't vote for #wealthcare
Senators If you value our nation and its people please take action to #ImpeachTrump now Trump is #UnfitToServe  #25thAmendmentNOW
Johnny, how's it going for scheduling a townhall meeting with your constituents? I double-dog dare you!! #TrumpcareSucks
Don't forget to let them know the American Medical Association is against this bill #trickyJohnny #protectourcare 
https://searchlf.ama-assn.org/undefined/documentDownload?uri=%2Funstructured%2Fbinary%2Fletter%2FLETTERS%2FBCRA-Letter.pdf …
senator, any comments youd like to make about POTUS behavior? still think he is good for America just bc he agrees w your policies?
Get government out of our lives! #REPEAL Obamacare, every last word. Don't replace it, ever!
Oh Iris. BOT BOT Iris...
Mr Resist Parrot: no bot here. Gov has NO role in health insurance.
By #BetterCare are you touting the end of Medicaid which covers 49% of all US births or the ending of rural care in this bill? For tax cuts
Did you visit the Hosp[ital here?  Oh wait, we don't have one.  My town doesn't have a hospital.  And Urgent care doesn't take gov insurance
RIGHT...keep telling yourself that.  Any PUBLIC town halls??
Did you tell them how many Texans would lose their healthcare so wealthy people can get an extra $50K a year? Texas deserves better thn you.
better healthcare would coverage for essential benefits and affordability 4 ALL @indivisibletxjc @MSNBC
#SinglePayer
And while ur at it #25thAmendment  
Don't you want all this crazy to end, John?
Impeach now& u have a shot at saving reelection
Did they happen to ask you how much you will personally benefit from this tax cut legislation? #BCRA
Did they tell you what the rest of #texas has told you? #VoteNoBCRA
Babies will die under BRCA.

When was the last time, if at all, you visited Veterans at any VA facility in Texas?
Maybe you should drop this ACA reform and just repeal.
And then what @txgho1911?
What respected medical organization or patient advocacy group supports this terrible bill? None of them. This bill puts patients last.
Did you get a chance to tip soon to be uninsured inpatients out of their bed? Or just fantasize about it?
Liar
I hope they were brutally honest with you and told you just how awful BRCA will be for their patients! You need to listen and understand!
Absolutely positively NO SINGLE PAYER! REPEAL the disastrous OC and let the FREE MARKET WORK!
Health care is not a commodity.
Johnnie Boy, we want something that is usable. No pre existing conditions & no caps - single payer is cheaper 4 gov. BTW #25thAmendmentNow
And no charging baby boomers FIVE times more!
Trumpcare is not healthcare. Why do the super rich need tax cuts @ the expense of our nation's most vulnerable?
Hospitals just want to get paid. $10 bandaids, anyone?
Great. Now take care of your constituents. Stop the secrecy and perks for the wealthy.
You are a fraud, you are slashing Medicaid and health care so you can cut taxes for wealthy. Shameful and immoral.
#trumpcare is HORRIBLE
Why?? To let them know you're about to give their most vulnerable patients one way tickets to your death panel?!! How sad ... & disgusting.
So what happened? Did they talk you out of the BCRA?
#Sad You put party over country and don't even have the balls to hold townhalls.
ACA isn't failing- GOP is sabotaging it. BRCA is just a big tax break for the rich
What a worthless liar you are Cornyn.

That is nice. Clearly you put the interests of corporations ahead of your constituents. Please hold a town hall and face us.
No John, No, bad John!!!
The senate bill has a 17% approval rating and you keep trying to shove it down our throats. We know what you're about: $$$$
did you talk with any actual doctors and patients or just insurance lobby lickspittles?
Insurance companies are LEAVING government imposed ACA, so why would they want more government??? You aren't making sense.
2.4 million Texans kicked off coverage so you can give rich folks a tax cut. Immoral and disgusting.
That's just not factual.  It's not the government's job to buy you insurance.  Get government OUT of it and watch what happens to costs.
So that you can then continue to ignore them?
Retire old man! You are #insignificant and #brownnoser
No arrest. No felony prosecution, as dictated by law. Politicians shouldn't even pretend to care! What's the point? You don't.
Republican visiting hospitals is = to Grim Reaper coming. BCRA means $ for wealthy & death for 1000's. You're not fooling anyone. #NoBCRA
What in your bill will cause people to get better care? Please don't tell me the simplistic answer of better competition and choice.
What is the result of your on line poll 4 TX voters support of R h/care bill?  Publish results & be transparent! Have townhall!
I'm sure that nurses could do a better job, if they weren't in fear of getting stomped, while doing their jobs!

*bing* those for-profit health ins plans dropped them like hot-potatoes onto taxpayers. @JohnCornyn  http://www.kbtx.com/content/news/Senate-Republicans-amend-health-care-plan-to-fight-opioid-epidemic-health-experts-skeptical--431909363.html …
Can you give us the bullet points of how BCRA will improve health care for TX patients?
Here are some practical ways that ACA could be improved. Are you interested in any of them? Any at all?
We lost our healthcare insurance, Thanks Obama.
Might want to have a talk in Greenville, TX, where they (PD and City Attorney) refuse to do anything about those who assault nurses.
When medicade is dead and buried those institutions  will out of business .
Did you tell them you are taking all the money for the old, poor, disabled and putting it in your pocket??  If not...you lied!
The only thing I want is PROMISED FULL REPEAL OF OBAMACARE! Keep your promise! Cruz seems to be only one in tune w/Texans!
Bot

Shame one you kid.
Texans want #SinglePayerNow. NO #BCRA.
The stop trying to take care from millions with#TrumpCare disaster. Fix the flaws in #ACA and work for American people.  #CountryOVERparty
Do some research on the average income of Republican donors vs Democrat.  I think you'll find it enlightening.
Single payor is the only thing that can improve on Obamacare
In Port -A, town hall?
Did you tell them you were planning on letting millions die with BCRA? #SaveOurCare #SaveMedicaid #YourYesTodayIsOurNoTomorrow
It's a wealthcare bill not a healthcare bill. You have zero interest in improving healthcare. #worstsenatorinusa
Abso-freaking-lutely!
When will you hold a town hall??
As soon as Trump releases his tax returns and the moment a Republican actually tries to help those in need instead of billionaires
Tell me when ANY politician has 'helped' anyone?  Quit looking East for answers.  Government is the problem not the solution.
