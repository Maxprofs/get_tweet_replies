@kamrananwar1973 Also privatization of government to increase their personal wealth please don't let that happen to us
Too bad your sitting back idle.
or complicit
everything we accuse other countries of we r as guilty if not more, we r an arrogant stiffnecked people, myself included
@Bonnieinchgo
Senator
Will you be remembered with cowards who bowed tryanny or honorable few who gave all for the Republic?
- A Congressman who actually GETS IT!  I'm with you Lindsey Graham, even though I am a Dem.
To be strictly fair, so have you and your party been doing at home for a long time. @raulita
yeah Lindsay the obstructionism is what made us vulnerable 2 this kind of foreign propaganda.
Trump is GOP FRANKENSTEIN and you need to rectify this horror. #putin #hacking
He's not Frankenstein. He's Caligula. Just older.
.@LindseyGrahamSC So the question now is do you, sir, have the integrity to condemn the President Elect for collaborating with them in this?
& @SenJohnMcCain have been very outspoken against Trump. They need the support of us all. God speed Sirs. @MitchBenn

If you're worried about this, and millions of people are, what do YOU personally intend to do about it?
@suicide_romance so do something about it
So what are you going to do about it? We're watching as both Tillerson & McMaster told us that we've done little to stop it here.
.  Yeah--like US has been doing forever.  Hypocrite.  If true, he did USA a great service.  Stop with the vagina rhetoric.
Senate can block the Putin bromancers. Just saying.
Small problem: Senate decisions are made by Mitch McConnell who is in Trumps camp
@SenateMajLdr wife on Cabinet #conflictsofinterest at minimum, potentially bribe. @ReliFrend @marybschneider @LindseyGrahamSC
McConnell himself opposed pubicizn of Russia hacking report b 4 the elections, 2 help Trump
He's near the top of my traitor list. His wife as Labor Sec is at minimum a COI, maximum bribe @ReliFrend @marybschneider @LindseyGrahamSC
Thank you Sen. Graham I have unfairly ridiculed you in the past. I am sorry. You are a voice of reason this cycle.
We can argue and debate about issues later, now is the time to save the Republic.
<--Doesn't GAF about the Republic or would've denounced Trump's ENTIRE "candidacy".
He did... But he was the only one.
When? That  *one* time? I don't recall him being al over the place calling Trump out. 
As rare as it is for me to side with him, Graham was rather outspoken in his condemnation of Trump
Seems he stopped talking @ some point. Did he get gulag'd w/Colin Powell? Shut out by the MSM?
Perhaps it fell under radar amongst all the other scandals. He has been steady voice @TallGrrl @harrisdustin7 @aadyaroshan @LindseyGrahamSC

Agree, now @GOP -- do your job!!
And YOU sit there doing nothing because YOU believe party over justice my friend. You will be retired soon. Sure changed since the days when you were a rabid dog going after Clinton.
Did you notice how the second Trump won the election, WikiLeaks started dumping stolen files on Angela Merkel? @LindseyGrahamSC
I'm sure it's totally a coincidence that Merkel is one of the only remaining Western leaders standing up to Putin, right? @LindseyGrahamSC
Backing LePin as well. @fawfulfan @LindseyGrahamSC
@LindaHaleRCSD trump is in on it #PutinTrump2016
you seem to be one of the few Republicans with both integrity and a spine left.
you lack the discernment to know what Lindsey is really up to.
but sadly, we did it to ourselves.
And they are currently assisted in these efforts by THE US PRESIDENT-ELECT. What are you doing about that?????? @Truman206
thank you for standing up. But why are you and McCain the only ones in the GOP outraged about this?
WOW never thought that I would agree with anything you say I hope it's more than lip service
thank you for saying this. Please keep standing up for democracy.
So it was the Russians responsible for 70yr old in-laws, in Midwest, to stand in line for hours to vote for Trump
@Eykis And Using @realDonaldTrump as their puppet.
@KORANISBURNING dude. Progressives...and sharia, muslims and refugees are doing quite well, without Russian assistance. 
wow that's quite a list you put together, it's always obvious the stupidity of the Trump voter
Why Thank you!  But I regret it is only a partial list-limited by the number 140-Add democrats
But they are helping ours. #HAPPYNEWYEAR and a BIGLY New Year Sherlock Graham!
I am Sherlock Holmes and I say you're wrong
You sound more like Moriarty to me. He knows  a lot too, but he uses his knowledge the wrong way.
I have never before been owned this hard. My hat is off to you, Chuck.
thanks, I think.  Just because we disagree doesn't mean we have to be disagreeable.
I couldn't agree more.
Don't forget we've been doing it for decades. We have no standing to call FOUL!
Election tampering is a reality, by whichever state is capable of it. Sorry u can't be civil.
I refuse to be civil to anyone rationalizing the undermining of our democracy.
How much Russian money did your campaign accept? 
Have you done an investigation?
@deanbarker Please Sen Graham this election cannot be legitimate. It was rigged & most Repubs won't come out and say that.
: Wikileaks proved it was rigged... Hillary cheated & still lost...it's legit...
Oh honey she didn't cheat The real person that cheated was TRUMP who was n contact with RUSSIA his whole campaign UR clules
@SoulFlyTry Ikr.
It's obvious and has been for awhile. #ComradeTrump must be investigated and held accountable.
Ikr.
BIGLY
@TBrianMalone This has all the hallmarks of a very Russian Coup d'Etat? What is the USA going to do about it?
With Trumps appointments and attitude toward Russia, is the US controlled now by a Russian Puppet?
No the US is not but Trump His investors are
America is sleepwalking into a form of fascism and is in effect in danger of a takeover
Lindsay you are one of those who destroyed democracy during Obama administration
, thank you. Can you get your fellow @GOP, including @SpeakerRyan and @SenateMajLdr, onboard? @BarackObama @JoeBiden
Don't have to be Sherlock to know that @LindseyGrahamSC is not a Republican, only pretends to get elected. Really a Democrat
Sen Graham is very involved with military. Look up his record before you criticize.
there was talk of this before the election but no one thought that Hillary would lose now it is a big concern lets move on
He has committed treason .. and Comey violated Hatch Act ...
Accusing ANY country of interfering in US internal affairs is very definition of pot calling the kettle black.
erm, citing Wikileaks in a pot-kettle-black argument is prettttyy funny...
How so....Wikileaks has a pretty good record (100%) of publishing the truth.  The CIA--not so much.
see http://time.com/4450282/wikileaks-julian-assange-dnc-hack-criticism/ … - https://www.wired.com/2016/07/wikileaks-officially-lost-moral-high-ground/ … & https://theintercept.com/2016/08/06/accusing-wikileaks-bias-beside-point/ …, from Intercept of all places
https://theintercept.com/2016/12/10/anonymous-leaks-to-the-washpost-about-the-cias-russia-beliefs-are-no-substitute-for-evidence/ …
cozying to Putin, lying about Putin, picking people who like Putin, praising Putin, & the discrepancies and
And Dems can't bring themselves to believe that SHE is the reason she lost.  Not Putin, not the Russians
The establishment loss because the people are tired of being screwed by their government.
They have 3 bases outside their borders; we have 100s. They spend 11% what we do on "Defense"- They R ringed by Nato bases.
"The right?" International spying's a fact of life. How many times did we try to assassinate Castro?
What U R calling 'direct intervention' apparently amounts to SOMEbody saying SOMEbody else said something. LOL
Curious: how angered were U in re: the revealed hard evidence of DNC rigging against Sanders that caused DW Shultz to resign?
.@LindseyGrahamSC And Trump is complicit. And so is any political leader who doesn't resist this.
: Do you mean the Current POTUS... Or the SOS that sold Russia uranium would be the ones responsible?
I mean any and all.
:This hacking has been an ongoing problem...nothing to do with Trump...plenty to do with our current politicians
Trump *is* one of our current politicians.
:Trump can't be held responsible for events happening long before he held any office...
Sure, he can. He asked Russia to meddle in the election. We all heard him do so.
: True...if it can be proved they did on his behalf that's a huge issue.
@DeniseGabbard So why is YOUR party on board with letting it happen here? Prove to US you're not INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION
@LuvAmerica2016 Thank you for fighting for us!
like Obama administration lobbying in Israel against Netanyahu?? Who's in favor of sanctions on ourselves?
when you lay with dogs you get fleas. So take a flea dip Trump
@blaclives so do what u r supposed to do #ImpeachTrump
..don't remember this? #IvotedforCIAmcmullin #NoClintonCIAcoup  Shell Game: A Whistleblowing Report
do is our CIA
what does #crookedhillary have on you?
Get something done even if it is just a start-This man/child won't be able to stand the heat in the kitchen
Thank you Sir you are UPSTANDING! @DearAuntCrabby
@kerryav5 From the great book...WELL DUH
and they already did ours, all you have to do is listen to Trump's admiration for Putin, this election cannot stand
Russian-elect Trumptinkov is unconstitutional and a red menace
@JoeNBC you been knowing that! What else is news
@VanJones68 we have a guy in SC that could not make the first cut running for POTUS. We should listen to him? Certainly not
Nope You and your like did all that by yourself. Now drowning in your own swamp
"400 pound Russian" good one. You're at bat to work for #AmericaFirst! Be THE statesman we need. #ivote
that job is being done by Democrats like you
►Shop at Best ►  http://ebay.to/1RMBEFs  
Sherlock Holmes Cape Coat
W/ confirmation of Russian interference wouldn't new election vote be best to penalize Putin's actions?!Otherwise he wins.
you're talking nonsense
how many coups has US effected in history? How many puppet regimes has US set up. How many US [CIA] NGOs operate globally?
oh PLEASE.....show us the proof.
Thnx. America needs help
@jdibb is exposing corruption undermining or strengthening democracy?
@JoeMyGod too little too late Miss Lindsey. Where were you MONTHS ago?!?!?
@chucktodd Russia took advantage of America's weakness which is racism. They used fueled hatred 2 install their candidate
@AndyRichter Thank you Senator for a sane and reasonable comment. Nice to know we can count on you to stand up to Trump
@matbo2 Sen. I may not agree with u on everything but fate of democracy is really in your hand!
@AndyRichter well gosh, maybe you should do something about it. Just a thought.
I guess the DNC & Media aren't as bad since they were just trying to do it in the U.S.
WE SHOULD KEEP A LIST OF THESE RUSSIAN AGITATORS ALONG WITH PROOF THEY DID WHAT YOU SAY. @LindseyGrahamSC @hotoynoodle
@AndyRichter 

And, we're No.1 on his "hit" parade!
@AndyRichter Lindsey when are you going to come out of the closet?
@ViewFromWise &I appreciate real patriots like he& McCain arent becoming bootlicks 2 the disaster #Trump
@ViewFromWise I don't always w/graham but hes a fellow veteran & i appreciate his willingness to work across the aisle
no shit, Sherlock 
@AndyRichter okay. Show some backbone and do something about it. If ever America beds you, it's now.
I agree with Lindsey Graham on something. Things have gone completely off the rails in this country.
@AndyRichter just not enough to do something about it, like standing up to Drump, politics over country Repubs
pretty much their MO forever? And you stupid simple SOB'[s are pretty much telling us what we already know???
Don’t have to be Sherlock to know GOP put party over safety and reason. Thanks!
@AndyRichter trying? I'd say they did.
@AndyRichter but Sherlock Holmes found evidence. Maybe they should be more like him.
Sherlock also knows Trump is dangerous. Tell me with a straight face that a mediocre prez  (HC) would be worse than Trump.
Lindsey, Show them Sumbitches in Washington some good ol' Southern Fight!!!  Don't let them get away with it!
PLEASE block Tillerson!
Hello dumbshit... they've been doing it with your grace for ever.
if he is sworn in we will look to you to lead the impeachment proceedings. God bless u senator
@AndyRichter There goes Lindsay Graham again, with the usual Liberal agenda. Right, Sherlock Hannity? @seanhannity
@AndyRichter And it seems to be working, despite the scoffing of this by so many in the GOP right now. 
@VeeVee America's worst fears coming true.A KGB implant nurtured over decades with East European wife has become president
@AndyRichter So.....what are we gonna do about it, Senator?
@AndyRichter you can even be Lindsey fucking Graham and still figure this one out
@BellaLibelle
You mean Russia is bombing countries until they submit to democracy? Oh wait, that is us.
his picks are way better than anything you could do Graham!
@chucktodd Sebator Trump belives the constitution means nothing all that matters is making money for his family.
how can we stop them here senator
@MommaJude1 we need a REAL patriot right now. #notrump #taintedelection
1 #FollowTheMoney Russians financing Trump  #TrumpOwnedByRussia but #RussiaNeedsTrump #ConflictOfInterest #taintedelection
@PeoplesVuePoint http://the-Donald.com/Bernie.html  START OVER! Lead, damnit!
Here are the sources of the American people! P.S. All Democrats!
@BillyT_202 please sir  convince your party before it becomes a reality
Ha! That is an assertion. Where is the proof?
@Lonestarmomcom 

I don't agree with much you say - but we agree on this point.
Generic- thank you for that. Wish more would see the big picture. 
Yes and Bill's foundation got money from Russian co who bought 20% of American uranium with Hillary's approval. Real Danger
@MiaFarrow Y DON'T ALL OF YA'LL N BOTH HOUSES PUT UR HEADS TOGETHER & FIGURE OUT HOW 2 STOP THE BS! YA'LL CAN DO IT!
Then hopefully you and your more rational colleagues will prevent the Russification of almost the entire WH cabinet.
But you don't care much cuz it helped you steal a supreme Court appointment right?
You sir, are DEFINITELY SHERLOCK HOLMES. More like Fritz the Cat or Bullwinkle. Maybe Mickey Mouse. Who knows?
I am a lifelong Democrat, but I you have beenthe only Republican to show consistent strength of character this cycle
@szwest1 
But Ronald Rump is smart
@szwest1 and you suggest what Mr. Senator?
As longtime Democrat I want 2 go on record as saying, thank u 4 putting our country before your party. Sincerely thankful.
Don't have to be Sherlock to know you are on the side of DC establishment instead of the American voters.
we are not a democracy. Read some US history, would you!
Russia once stated,"they would conquer us from within".

@LisaToddSutton feels awful having to retweet him but the Maverick & him are making a lot of sense
Don't feel too bad, they knew of this in Sept and kept quiet....
he's just the worst & to have to root for this coward right now is terrible
@kate_vaughn Nope, you just have to have some semblance of know how in world affairs. Unfortunately the PEOTUS has none.
Totally agree Senator Graham. This was obvious during the campaign. Trump or the people around him know something. 
Please support a full investigation into this as soon as possible.
@maggieNYT McC is trying to blame POTUS for keeping hackvquiet MC threat POTUS w sa it ws pol MC=kpT Fm impeach MC fm tresn
Rich coming from a guy who is completely clueness about most things
@chucktodd Lindsay Graham hates DJT so he is joining the conspiracy to label Russia as electing Trump. Low down it it!
@chucktodd  Soros known for bringing down democracies working with Clintons U fools @LouDobbs @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle
@JohnCornyn huh?? Aren't you in a position to STOP this
Proof of specific action on presidential election and you have my attention Lindsey. Done with mouthing with no backup.
@VanJones68 Fix it and stop whining.  Trump  is a product of  electoral  college.
Facts please, anything else you have to offer is allegations & fake news.
THANK YOU For speaking UP  putting #CountryOverParty disagree with you and @SenateGOP over many things  agree we  #USA
A known hater who has no proof of anything
@SenSchumer I am a liberal old lady+ I  u. U will not allowccoverup likevMC wl he = prt T frm impeach +MC 'm treason
Senator are you going to call on the Electoral College to stop this? #resist #theresistance
Yet you looked the other way for years. What are you going to do about it now? We can't fight alone.
Simple request:  please share your views with the #PEOTUS, and suggest that he actually pay attention to intelligence experts?  Please?
STOP RUSSOPHOBIA it affected on Russian Americans kids

We are NOT a DEMOCRACY, we are a REPUBLIC !! Get it right !!!!!  #StupidMan
It's just what americans liked to do all over the world, when it suited them in their ideology.
What's going to happen to FBI & Comey? Something is VERY wrong FBI. What happened to their neutrality? Integrity? Ethics?
@chucktodd Thank you very much Senator!  We desperately need your voice fighting for the truth.
@JohnCornyn Graham has a back bone, while Cornyn is busy putting his knee pads on for Russian Elect POTUS Trump.
Awesome @LindseyGrahamSC! Now get some teeth & take action! If true, this administration cannot take power. Their objectives are obvious.
your Tweet was quoted in an article by @washingtonpost
@Daniell30653742 They're called Russia now but should truthfully be renamed back to the USSR.
I thought that too- US is now part of a new USSR. We're just another Ukraine to them.
i feel a large scale #RedDawn coming. #WOLVERINES!
@JohnCornyn clinton brought up the Russian hacking violations in debate. Need a reminder?
@JohnCornyn please do not brush off these allegations. It's been known for many months.
@SenSchumer Our democracy has already been undermined. Russia, Assange, Comey conspired to install Trump In office.
@VanJones68 and they've got their puppet in DC So very sad.
You are one of the only Americans that can save Our Democracy. Give the Electoral voters a choice. Dec 19 is the deadline
Feels very weird to agree with you sir. But these are very weird times. Please keep up this fight. This is not normal.
@ZaibatsuNews Sen. Graham , America needs a hero to stand against Trump and Russia.  Please be that hero!
@FriendEden100 Thank you Sen Graham for your integrity.
@ZaibatsuNews Isn't that the same the US used to do? Maybe Putin studied Kissinger.
@SenSchumer THANK YOU BOTH for putting #CountryOverParty. Admired!
WOW! So there is one republican with a moral conscience!
@ZaibatsuNews
we need you now.
Thank you Lindsey from a human rights activist!

who knew that I wld be agreeing with both Graham and walsh I'm the span of a day?
So Putin hacks the Democrats, and he's rewarded by Trump? That's the worry. Is the GOP compromised?
it's kind of concerning when the head of the GOP is quite openly trying to collude with the Russians
Nor 2 determine Russia was influencing Election in favor of Trump. Don't snow us! Was outcome influenced-hand recounts!
@chucktodd not any worse than USA has done by destabilizing Iraq, Libya or 1/2 of the Middle East! Your policy have failed!
I strongly disagree. Russia does not give a dime for neither democracy nor fascism. It is about divide and rule
That's correct. Russia went silent and has worked for 6-8 year to infiltrate and control the politicians, trump
Sherloc delt with evidence wheres urs. Listen u know Russia had nothing to do with it that was  Democrats smoke screen evil
show me proof didn't Hillary ok the sale of uranium to the russians looks to me as Putin owed Hillary a favor
I hope you do the right thing for our country and reach out to the elector college and urge them to go with the qualified
Where is your evidence? Where is the proof Russia did anything. CIA also said WMD's in Iraq and there wasn't any.
Coming from a senator who helped 2fund ISIS. McCain appears to have been involved as well. Careful where you tread sir.
How will this be rectified?
thank you Lindsey...our democracy is under attack+u know Putin OWNS lil b*tch Trump..u and GOP need 2 stop him!!!
hey South Carolina- Please stop electing this whiny, illegal immigration loving, neocon, Democrat into office.
Grahamnesty fell all over himself 2vote2 confirm John Kerry. But he'll betray his party yet again to deny Rex. #Sourgrapes
@AhmedBaba_ -And they are succeeding! Without firing a shot! America wake up! Our Freedoms are threatened!
Doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that you're trying to undermine our President-elect either. #Sourgrapes
Kudos sir. A republican who grew a pair. Perhaps there's still hope the US doesn't go up in flame.
ur no Sherlock, putin tried to humiliate Clinton for interfering in the Russian elections in 2011, thats y the emails.
