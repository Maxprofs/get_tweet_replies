Wow.  He would probably weep if he saw our country today and what has become of the Presidency.  RIP.
and he is still sucks
the only president worse than Trump . He dealt arms to Iran .. making sure the Iranians didn't release hostages
Reagan is rolling in his grave right now. #USA #THESHAME
@samkrone not always bad to look backwards. Bring back our Big Tent
HOW DARE YOU MENTION REAGAN WHILE YOU SUPPORT @realDonaldTrump. Reagan would be ashamed of the GOP...and U.
@SenatorLankford You would call Reagan libtard! I was RNC delegate nominated him, you faux GOP poseurs.
Too bad the GOP of today doesn't listen to what Reagan had to say about borders, walls, and the undocumented
You republicans don't get to claim Reagan anymore. He's a liberal by your backwards standards.
@SenateGOP Let's go back to the fun money spent on Past @GOP robbing the Pigism. Its still the same:
https://pigism.wordpress.com/about/ 
and it has more high levels of lead as before..can we say it didn't happen?
My goodness I miss that man! #BestPresidentEver
We're you even born then? Terrible President! Great show, bad policy. Iran Contra.
U DO REALIZE THAT REAGAN IGNORED AIDS Crisis KILLING MILLIONS - U DO REALIZE He Cut Funding for #veterans
@SenatorLankford that's the new Repubs favorite actor-pols. Y? Installed scotus to yesvote lobbies in demcy = GOP rainmaker.
@SenatorLankford Reagan was the fifth most dangerous president. George W. Bush was #4. Trump is numbers 1, 2 and 3.
Mr. Reagan would be appalled with the state of our union under Bannon.
@SenatorLankford on this day let us pause and wonder what he would think of Trumps Putin crush.
oh not much of an idol for Social Security.  His legend is tarnished and best not to idolize or emulate.
He raised taxes, his economic policy was a failure, and today's GOP would be an embarrassment to him.
@SenateGOP currently California is generating the clean power of him rolling over in his grave
@SenateGOP President Reagan would be ashamed to be mentioned with republicans of today
Happy Birthday to the Gipper
@SenatorLankford FYI: Reagan did expand Federal Government.
@SenateGOP He's probably rolling in his grave.
Pres Reagan would have been so disappointed in you
@SenRubioPress no -fault divorce along with Title IV-D has bullied American citizens to death.  RIP my brother Jon.
President Reagan set on the direction to 20 Trillion dollar in national debt.
@SenatorLankford I'm glad Reagan dead.
Congratulations on writing a great gov tweet! http://shiningsea.measuredvoice.com/Reagan_Library/status/828640712816259072 â€¦ (Ranked 3rd for Feb 6.)

At least you can do simple math unlike unqualified DeVos. Vote no.
He would be appalled and deeply saddened at what Trump and the Republicans are doing to America.
@JohnCornyn he would be ashamed that you are supporting #Devos !
Currently rolling over in his grave
A truly great man! He was the right leader at the right time. #patriot
@SenateGOP  He would say no to DeVos!!

At least Reagan believed in public education. Your last name should be CRAVEN. Your political career is over.
@SenRubioPress Regan would be disgusted by @GOPoversight @jasoninthehouse refusal to hold hearings on Trump's ties to Putin.
Ronald Reagan synopsised his excellent presidency "All in all, not bad, not bad at all".
miss his leadership, he was the reason I joined the Army at 17
Reagan would be ASHAMED of you if you vote for DEVOS. VOTE NO!!!!!
he protected us against the Russians, he didn't strive to be like them, unlike @realDonaldTrump
Trump is no Reagan! Get into present times, you old fogey- 2017! (from a contemporary, if you know what that means!)
@SenateGOP Time to stand up to Trump for education equality for all No DeVos
How many years is that in Grizzly lives? #dumpdevos
@JohnCornyn Vote NO on Devos! We know we only need one more person to stand up for our children and future. We will remember
You don't have that problem either Mr. President.  #RIP
...Happy Birthday Mr. President 
You are truly missed!!!
@HeyTammyBruce How can it be a "happy birthday?" He's deceased!
@SenateGOP, Happy Birthday President Reagan, this day should be honored as a national holiday.  Enjoy Heaven Mr. President.
...would have been a better Pres than Obama if he was put back in WH as is... RIP Mr. President.
@JustCrum79 Happy Birthday Mr President.
I miss his leadership and his optimism
@JohnCornyn Reagan would have NEVER supported or nominated DeVos to run our schools. #coward #noDevos
Those were the days..... I can here the All in the Fsmily theme song now
OUR KIDS might not know that 106 years ago after Betsy Devos takes over
Reagan rolling over in his grave hearing praise of Putin. Speak up! let your Emperor know he has no clothes.
@SenateGOP he would APPALLED at the Russian stooge in the White House. UNREAL!!!!
@SenateGOP Thanks for the math lesson! But if you care so much about education the public #NotoDeVos The people have spoken!
Plz vote NO on DeVos - our kids deserve somebody qualified
He TWINKLED so BRIGHT!!!
I live near Reagan Library. He's rolling in his grave at sellout Repubs who sold their souls.
@LaurenBarker28 hahah it was on my timehop today! I always wish him happy birthday

@SenateGOP Regan would be man enough to #impeach a puppet of the enemy! You better get this fixed NOW!

@SenateGOP he set back Civil Rights by @ least 25 yrs. by only targeting blacks for his war on drugs but white pple luv him.
