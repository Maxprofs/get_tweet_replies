We were promised REPEAL, Cornhole!!!
I don't mind it doesn't EXPAND Medicaid  as fast, keeping parts of ACA that make insurance cos beneficiaries of tax payer is wrong. REPEAL!
Premiums will skyrocket for people with preexisting conditions.
If you have an argument then make it to American public.  Don't keep it secret. Should be an open debate. Congress = failed leadership
Rewrite the medical CPT codes as part of opening to cross state lines for insurance. Medical records follow with social # .Thus no duplicate
4 days ago you said there was no Senate bill...
As we seek to save Americans from failures of Obamacare, reports of polls fail to acknowledge that no Senate bill yet exists #workingonit
Ben, he has a different answer depending upon who he is talking to.
From a Texas constituent... stop lying Senator
From another Texas constituent, we are so sick of your insulting lies!!
From another Texas constituent and veteran: vote No on this Senator. It's a bad bill that's going to hurt Texans.
Yet another Texan Constituent, that USA Today opinion article was written by a GOP Senator & the author of Bush 43's tax cuts
WE WANT A CLEAN REPEAL OF ACA!! We put GOP in majority to do this!!  DO YOUR JOB! We don't want Govt HC. Look at baby Charlie in U.K. NO WAY
- And how would TX poor fare under Austin's greater "flexibility" to administer Medicaid? Judging by history, not good
Preserves medicaid's original purpose, not expansion right? Medicaid for sick, destitute, widowed, orphaned - not able bodied, childless.
Have NO confidence that this is true
opinion column by @SenToomey -No thanks! I'll go w/ facts & continue to fight against #BCRA & cuts to #Medicaid. My child's life at risk
As a former Republican, I can say that John has lost his love for America and democracy. He was, past tense, a man of honor. He lost path.
This is an opinion piece. Let's wait to see the newest CBO score with real math.
CBO is a static model that never takes into acct the effects and resulting savings.  CBO is misleading.
Static vs dynamic CBO scoring - I will leave that to the finance experts to look at and debate.
Cornyn's afraid of hearings, town halls , CBO. Why?  It's an awful bill hurting people.
Obamacare is hurting people!!!!  Every government attempt at 'helping' only ends up in hurting people.
I respectfully disagree.
Not so.  Why do you support this tax cut for the wealthy?  This bill hurts the ordinary Texans you pledged to work for.
Medicaid expansion? Not so much. Essential Health Benefits? Not so much. Premium stabilization for older Americans? Not so much.
This is an opinion piece. A partisan one at that. More #shady politics from Senator Cornyn
Not according to the CBO.
Mayh that also shows tax cuts for top 400 households? Fun stuff.
1 like per hour... 27 million Texans are obviously buying what you're selling, Senator
GOP Health care is a Wealth Transfer nothing more

Please stop, Sen Cornyn. You guys have allowed Putin to take over the White House. Please fix that first- then we'll talk healthcare.
Agreed. No vote on healthcare until you determine if we have a traitor in the WH!

Money bomb Cornhole's opponent.
Repeal ACA, that was the promise to the people!  Seems Senate republicans are worried about someone else.
This is not a true statement. Show me the proof!
The gang of 13 learned nothing. We are non competitive in the world. Our market healthcare costs 7% more in GDP than global competitors
- Why is Medicaid growing so fast? Toomey doesn't address. More poor - Widening inequality of wealth gap. Start over.
Yes, go ahead make pharma, insurance, Tom Price, and yourself richer. You don't fool us. We know what you are doing. For once, #DOYOURJOB
That's an opinion piece not supported by facts. But R's don't care about facts (or the health of Americans).
AARP DOES NOT AGREE
Lies, lies , lies! Stop with the 1984 doublespeak! You work for us John and your are not doing your job!
We all know you are pushing an agenda because you are in somebody's pocket.  It sucks, we see it and are tired of you lying and blaming dems
It needs an audit for fraud!!
This is an OPINION piece.
Liar
Nice try Senator. We're on to you and your tweeting of lies.
No it does not. We've done the math. Your bill will kill people
I am a doctor who you represent.  You are hurting the children of Texas. The CBO says $800 BILLION dollar cut. Tell.The.Truth.
U advocate staying on line 1?
We fixed Donald Trump’s misleading chart that claims Republicans are increasing Medicaid funding http://bit.ly/2tsCTFl  
Really? Do you think we are idiots? We can read Johnny boy. A link to an article written by Toomey? Just stop your bull. #killthebill
Sorry Sen. I don't trust GOP math for $hit! How about some hearings? Revised CBO report? Have you talked to any experts? #worstsenatorinusa
You are lying. Using an editorial written by one of your cronies is not independent proof.  #SaveACA #SaveOurCare
You know if this bill wouldn't actually lead to ppl dying your constant attempt to spin this particular lie might be entertaining.
Nope. U R lying again. Not surprised since treason is ok by U. Have U no morals? R U in @DonaldJTrumpJr pocket too?
Where's the CBO report? You're credibility is subzero
@tedcruz Really? You R the best Representation for Texas citizens? Both of you need term limitation! #TurnTexasBlue @wendydavis
I wish this were true, but Texas turned down Federal $$$ before to avoid expanding Medicaid. You R speaking FAKE NEWS
It's not a math question Senator.  Its whether the budget meets the need.  Vast majority of Americans don't think it does.
Like the fuzzy math W used to talk about??? @JohnCornyn
Republicans don't do math very well.
Why would any intelligent person believe you, one of dumbest in Senate?
Your constituents want you to fix Obamacare.  Listen to them!  Oh, and we also care about treason and Russia, despite what Cruz says.
But you said that you are still #workingonit, regarding the bill. How could Toomey & Lindsey know if it preserves Medicaid?
Lying again John!!  You want it cut. You did not work with state to expand ACA. Disabled, poor and seniors death on your head!!
if you vote for trumpcare..we will vote you out of office..fast and furious.
Only 12% approve of Senate bill, which you're making meaner. There's math for you.
So you dump administration on the states and cut funding with block grants. Where's the so-called flexibility?
Stop the madness @JohnCornyn.  It is a LIE by any measurement.
Capping and block granting Medicaid has always been a bad idea. Council on Disability report: https://ncd.gov/publications/2013/05222013 …
Your are a liar until proved otherwise.
And to think he was a judge.
Somebody's lying here! Cornyn? Barrasso?
"What we had in the original bill has not changed with regard to Medicaid,” Sen. Barrasso (R-WY)
Almost 75 million Americans receive Medicaid. That drives you nuts, doesn't it?

So we still pay for free loaders while those of us that work and produce get 5k deductible and trillion in debt???
Only if you went trump university, quit lying senator.
you just proved you are a stupid idiot
Hey John, where's your commentary on Trumps collusion with Russia during the election?  You seem to spout other BS but have no opinion. lol!
Trust me, John benefits greatly from the perks he receives from congress.  From healthcare to retirement, he has nothing to worry about.
It sure an hell preserves the 1% outrageous and obscene tax cut, the last 20 years proves it. The GOP is for the rich not the common man !!!
John Cornyn u should resign from t/senate. Aren't u tired of being Mitch's little puppy? Uhave nerve 2show up for MLK march in San Antonio.
We get it John.  Your post IS AN OPINION NOT BUILT ON FACT.  We know your war toys are more important than your constituency's health.
Trump U or DeVos?
I wish you could be honest for once in your life.

Also, you might want to look into this Russian collusion thing. Could be big.
What the math proves is that 15 million lose Medicaid coverage, 7 million more lose healthcare all thanks to you and your callous GOP allies
Senator, you need to go back and take a mathematics class.
Are interns posting your tweets?  Amateur hour . . .
Pat Toomey is your Republican colleague. The two of you must have gone to the same math schools.
I'll wait for CBO score
How about a fraction of a percent tax on those Wall Street derivatives that provide nothing of value (beyond multi-million exec bonuses)?
Please stop making people dumber

How dare you. I had a split second of relief, only to find you'd tweeted a ridiculous opinion piece. This is my child's *life* Senator.
1) The flaw in the thinking is Medicaid is growing faster than GDP, when it is healthcare costs that are growing faster. Capping Medicaid
2) won't stop healthcare from growing faster than GDP, in fact as uncompensated care comes into the system HC costs will escalate. As stated
3) it is simple math... there is NO FREE healthcare, so the costs at highest billable rate for the uncompensated care gets spread against
Then let the proposed bill be made public and have the integrity to allow for questions and debate, Senator. Why should we believe you?
Is this the one we will see Thursday and then the CBO next week?
Why do you keep spreading this lie?  What say you about Trump and Russia after Don Jr's emails, always the emails...
Let's see hearings to prove it. Why are you being secretive?
Medicaid & Medicare R being secured only DEMOCRATS R causing great uproar about this BECAUSE it profits them. GOP R 4 all American Citizens.
Math can be manipulated, as can people.
Lol. Thanks John. Your bill still sucks.
Doesn't fix ACA problems, insures 22 million less people. https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2017/06/26/budget-office-paints-republican-health-plan-as-an-insurance-dystopia/#418a2c87599c … It's a tax kickback, it's not a health care plan.
Trying to scale back Medicaid will only empower the Dems. Better to require Americans to fully pay for Medicaid using Federal payroll tax.
You are naive.
Liar.
would be more credible if written by an economist instead of Senator Pat Toomey. Almost like quoting yourself, isn't it?
STOP THE NONSENSE! No matter how many tweets you send it doesn't change FACT OBAMACARE WORKS & will work better when YOU FIX WHAT GOP BROKE!
Your math skills are off
Wake up, Sir!  These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot (U, if ur silent)
You guys are so used to lying:
You lie as bad as Trump
Wait, I thought there was no bill?
If I wasn't disabled, I would run against you. Republican = Liar
Donald Trump jr. Email chain
Tell HELLER....he is afraid of Dem Lies in NV MEDIA 24/7!!!!
Texan,here. 75006 zip.  Is anybody defending the Const?  Put off healthcare til we habpve read it, til Russ resolved.
Well I am in Troy, Illinois and I am on disability and Medicaid, I can't believe you have my back w ur tweets. 1/2
But with states having the ability to opt out it really doesn't make a difference
Please stop. U r making urself look worse w/each asinine Tweet. We went to school before the age of DeVos, we r smarter than u would like.
You too John, RR not good for your re-election. How can u look at urself in the mirror while you take away health insurance from 22 mil
You shouldn't be worried about healthcare at this point since the bill can't be signed by the current POTUS
Reader Note: USAToday opinion piece written by @PatToomey & Lawrence Lindsey, fired by Pres. Geo. W. Bush for underestimated Iraq War cost.
It says "Opinion contributors" right at the top! Of course, they're a couple of folks who'll be benefiting from that tax cut. Like you.
you are no better than the White House and the Press briefings you do nothing but lie.800 billion cut makes H/C BETTER
I have access to cigarettes every day some are $5  and $4 take $3 from me where am I going to find some for $1 or $2
Huh? 
IT LITERALLY SAYS "OPINION" AT THE TOP JOHN. STOP TWEETING OUT MISLEADING BULLSHIT JOHN
Oh shit, we are back to voodoo math. Texas, where football counts and kids can't.
No one wants your terrible TrumpCare bill, John. Old, young, poor -- everyone but millionaires and crooked GOP senators hate it. Try again.
If "preserve" means hanging by it's fingernails, I guess your are right. CBO is a much better source than USA today.

Keep in mind, that's an opinion piece.
Senator, describe how Texas would interpret that "flexibility" that Toomey and Lindsey call for.  Which of your constituents deserve care?
Wrong, Bad, Selfish, Greedy only benefits your rich friends
Your focus on health care is misguided. Step Up! Time to handle WH and russia. The lies regarding trump/Russia. #work4TEXANS #Disgrace
Math and honesty are obviously not your strong suits
Why are you afraid of hearings and town halls?  You don't want public scrutiny
Today I think we should be talking about treason, don't you?
Yes, and you can use math to prove 1=2 when you divide by 0
1. You know this isn't true. 2. Why are you still pushing major legislation in light of today's revelations? Secure the homeland, John!
Hmm. My calculations show you're a liar and a doodoo head.
Clueless in Texas #FakeSenator
Who isn't in the dark
 It appears he wants us to believe his tweets. I voted for the jackass.  <---- hanging head in shame!!!!
