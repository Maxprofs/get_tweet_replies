good lord. No telling what kind of disease you might get from wearing them. I recommend burning.
ugh. You are treading on dangerous ground and these ridiculous socks won't save you. #ivote
LOL, bet they're made in China!
Maybe instead of tweeting socks you could answer the 3 letters I've sent you and all the other ppl trying to get in touch with u
Figures...another example of your passive-aggressive bullshit, "john"
WTF you are tweeting about Trump socks as your constituents are angryYou seriously need to go!
something you can teehee and giggle at with your swamp buddies.
Please wear them to remind you of who he really is. A loud bully with no idea how to run a nation.
Wow. Who knew a pair of socks could make one's feet stink even more? #resist
Cool, John.. I recommend you keep them in the bathroom.. never know when you'll run out of toilet paper.. #IllegitimatePresidency
I wouldn't put my feet in those if i were you.
I want to see President Trump's taxes #TrumpTaxReturns
@realDonaldTrump probably hates them. I'd be be careful.
Look kind of loud. Matching tie, though.
Trump is selling sox now too? lol
and pimping senators like our John coryn to advertise for him. How's the swamp Johnny?
Those are not becoming. Who gave them to you, Russia?
The socks really capture his rage filled personality. Wish you wouldn't attach your star to someone so dishonest & destructive.
just what you need, more Trump.
