Dont forget! November 6, 2018

PRE-MEDITATED MURDER IF U VOTE YES!
wants to gut the Endangered Species Act... He does NOT CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT AT ALL!
Photo ops meaningless- We live w/consequences of your donor beholden agenda...BUILD THE WALL ASAP- 2018 losses
Why didn't you hold a TOWN HALL MEETING while you were there?  Chicken?  Gallina?
still waiting on a town hall - I see you're still in TX 
#KILLTrumpCare #KILLTrumpCare #KILLTrumpCare #KILLTrumpCare #KILLTrumpCare #KILLTrumpCare #KILLTrumpCare #KILLTrumpCare #KILLTrumpCare
Build a wall and deport all Senators who refuse to listen to constituents.
@Indivisibletx02 But no Town Hall??? #Sissy #GOPCoward
When are you coming to North Texas to visit with constituents?  You represent all Texans #DoYourJob
Your constituents would also like a visit. Man up and have a town hall meeting!
When can you come see your constituents? 78216 here.
But still no #TownHall ? I'm starting to get the feeling you don't actually like your constituents. SAD!
@MonsterMarcia @JohnCornyn @JudgeCarter doesn't like them, and is afraid of them. Thinks job is secure.
glad u have a friend #showmethereplacementplan
While I respect the judiciary, it is clear you support someone who does not. Why? Do you disagree? Show it.
Carter town hall in round rock 2.22.17.  Guess Mr. Carter won't be able to make it.   That's too bad.
you could visit with lots of friends if you would visit with your constituents and represent them in Congress.
All Texans are your constituents. That'S democracy Equal access to elected leaders. NONE OF YOU WERE ELECTED KING.
Constituents in Austin #ATX want a #TownHall Instead of you Drinking in Laredo after you cashed your welfare check.
did you visit boys town, should visit town hall
GREAT. What a worker!! You're out playing bookie instead of working. Town Hall?
is he a real judge or a so called judge as your buddy, Trump would say. Pursue truth and justice. we're waiting.
How about a great visit with your constituents in Houston?
@MonsterMarcia @JohnCornyn He's too big of a pussy. Maybe trumpy will grab him.
What about going after the employers of illegals? How abt 1 day in jail for each man day worked by an illegal?
Come visit us in a Town Hall.  Remember us, your constituents?
John, meeting constituents is part of your role as a US Senator - it's not just about taking trips, looking busy.
Really glad ya'll have time to meet up. So happy for you. Could we get a townhall soon please?
how about comprehensive immigration reform, not just deportation and denying entry.
says two old white guys...
Zip Code 77388 (Tax-paying constituent) wondering why you can do this but not hold a Town Hall.
shame on you. Go earn your damn paycheck and speak with your constituents. #resist
77096 here, AGAIN.  When are you visiting your constituents here in Houston?  We are so eager to hear from you.
Nice that you'll visit him, but not the rest of us.  #TownHall
Thank you for working with local people on this. A town hall would include more people, too!
working on your next Town Hall with constituents, right?
I think the reason you can hold a town hall meeting is because you cannot enter the people
Can't you see your friend in Washington? You should be listening to your constituents, or are you afraid to hear what we'll say?
Stop going on field trips and meet your constituents
CORNYN = TRUMP. We won't forget that.
#WilcoTownHall listen to your constituents not the cheeto!!
since youre in Texas you surely have some time set aside to meet with your constituents. ie the people you work for
do you job, man! Stop preening for the cameras and hold a Town Hall with YOUR CONSTITUENTS.
Both of you. Go back to Congress, and do your jobs instead of grandstanding on a false immigration issue..
Just checking to make sure you represent ALL Texans, including the ones you disagree and ignore.
That's great but you should meet more than just your friend on you trip to Texas. Throw a Town Hall. It'll be fun.
Coward, answer your phone.
you both remember those people that vote and you presumably work for???
You need to meet with your constituents in town meetings.
TOWN HALLS!!!
might you have a chance to visit with your other friend, your constituents? #TownHall
terrific topic to share with the 20 million constituents who elected you & pay your salary +3 pensions! Town hall?
John, leave your echo chamber! Constituents want to talk to you about ACA, Trump/Russia, etc
People who are organizing town halls are your constituents
so the only people you meet with are government employees or big $$ donors. Got it. #wearewatchingyou
Oh, cool. A human echo chamber.
Please hold a town hall meeting in San AntonioTX
I'm thrilled that youre visiting you buddies on our dime. now  do your job and have a town hall in Dallas!
how will you protect farmers from Trump's trade wars and border property owners from Trump's eminent domain 4 wall
good question from his base voters that he can't see!
Talk about immigration, the wall, taking away AHC. Sticky issues but no more ignoring what important 2 TXn's, plz.
Neat! That is a town in Texas! Please talk to your constituents not just your buddies. Thanks
how's that working?? Bad very bad
You don't have to hide together. You could just hold a town hall, and actually answer to your constituents.
They're desparados hiding on the border
Desperate desperados... Butch Cowardly and the Sundance Wimp.
In case you didn't know, there is more to Texas than the valley. When will you visit rest of state for townhalls?
How about you discuss this and other policies at a #TXTownhall #WheresCornyn #UNPaidConstituent #WhyHide
. when you going to have a town hall meeting?  I have questions for you.
is a smart guy, but
 @JudgeCarter has nothing intelligent to say.  His job is to do what #GOP says.
I'm happy you were able to meet with your friend. Will you please hold a #TownHall to meet with your constituents?
how about we have a town hall to discuss?
town hall anytime soon?
your constituents in dallas missed you at the march supporting immigrants and refugees last saturday. we also missed a town hall
reminder that the senator thinks any pushback to his or trump's policies is a conspiracy. senate whip: conspiracy theorist
says raids focused on threats: homicide, aggravated sexual abuse, sexual assault. This is false. http://buff.ly/2m3KXF3https://goo.gl/Vp7IkB â€¦
