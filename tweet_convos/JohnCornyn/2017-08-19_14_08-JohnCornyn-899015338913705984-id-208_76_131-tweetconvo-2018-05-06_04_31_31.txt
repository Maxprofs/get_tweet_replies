You are ridiculous. Do something about the clown show in the WH. Do something about gerrymandering in Tx. #VoteHimOut
The clown left president trump is trying to fix. Jobs are back the future was looking pretty good until they had to lie somemore.
#ThanksObama for  jobs. Do research, don't parrot the Mango Mussolini. Stop spreading propaganda. Shame on you for helping him spread hate
Have them work their asses off.  So I can take from them. Homeless foster kids seniors. Instead spent on another country. Shame on u
What in the hell do you think is going to gaooen when all of the tax cuts go to the rich. My middle class ass will be paying for them.
Don't act like a fucking victim. O had to clean up the financial crisis caused by the GOP under Bush. Then, he was able to work for us.
U justify murders. Besides it was in response to someone calling jihad against America. I'm sure u support that too
What has Justice Thomas done except get APPOINTED? He doesn't give opinions or ask questions from the bench. He's embarrassing to AA's
@lawbarrett55 @dcexaminer 
There's a new POTUS in town!
i guess wr could build a statue of a coke can with a couple of pubic hairs.
He is mentioned! How he harassed Anita Hill.
Total bullshit. Plus, Clinton spunked on an intern in the Oval Office. I bet he's in the Smithsonian.
Clinton Clinton Clinton all you think about is Clinton!
Yes in 1998 , he was found not guilty.What does that have to do with anything?
This is a humiliation to the black people who really deserve it.
Are you prepping for a career in standup comedy? You whine about people criticizing Trump but your Twitter acct is nothing BUT complaints.
Here goes the divisive Sr. Senator from Texas. He divides us any way he can to distract us from his utter lack of policy ideas. @statesman
Because the majority of Americans believed Anita Hill and he has asked one question his entire tenure from the bench.  He is not worthy!
More idiots everyday!
Remind me again what Justice Thomas has done for blacks?
I don't think white people get to pick.
You are welcome to set up your own museum and feature all your favorite all-star sexual predators Corny but no thanks from the rest of us.
Bill Clinton and Ted Kennedy?
I don't know about Ted, but Bill's affair was between two consenting adults. It doesn't qualify for #CornynsSexPredatorEmporium
She was a subordinate. He was also accused of harassment and rape.
She consented, she's always maintained that. I don't know about the other stuff.
Thomas shouldn't be a justice in the first place. Anita Hill, ring any bells?
Old white men of the @SenateGOP need to go!
Anita Hill called. She said .....well I guess you know.
Disgusting-
Liberal agendas are attempting to destroy America

Justice Thomas is an artifact. Old. Silent.
A few people are using the museum as a political arm and destroying it's authenticity as a teaching and uplifting mechanism.
Replace the leadership. The director needs to resign.
Stop the demagoguery! It's beneath you Senator. Didn't Clarence Thomas voted against his grand parents eventhough he was raised by them?
Clarence Thomas is a pariah in the Black community. His career is based on his success & limiting the success of other blacks.
What is your point/position?
A man that publicly took a knee for what is right unlike you, that can't stop babbling stupidity to stay n 45s grace
I guess Justice Thomas never did anything Afro Americans appreciate.
Dude. STAY IN YOUR LANE.
I guess Judge Thomas could be included as a participation trophy. He came to all the meetings, just never did anything of note.
Maybe don't start career off with people knowing you are a sexual predator.
Justice Thomas has never made any contribution to the Africa American race It not about being Black it is about making a effort
For us it is Justice Justice Thomas thinks he is White- HE has not done anything to help African American as a whole HE stands for nothing
Just say what's really inside your dark, slimey heart. You're itching to beat down statue protesters...it's obvious what you're getting at
You mean the Justice that lawyer Anita Hill accused of sexually harrassing her when she worked for him? Not my choice for museum material.
Uncle Tom, I mean Clarence Thomas, can go to the Smithsonian Museum of American Hysteria.
That needs to go
Senator, you're complaining like a whiner.  As Senator you can call/write them & tell us how it went.  Seriously.
Did you know that his parents are White? Really !!
Like you care about blacks? Just trying to stir the pot
That's ridiculous
Umm, no sexual harrassers allowed
Impeach Trump and he will start standing.  Justice Thomas was not the first Africn American as chief justice.
What has Thomas ever done to dismantle racism?
Yup. Sounds right to me. Unless Smithsonian can dig up a VHS of "Long Dong Silver".
What? Did Thomas wake up and say something? Kaepernick sacrificed his career for what he believes in. Thomas has done nothing for anyone.
Old white racist questions African Americans choices for what goes in their own museum. Since when did they need your validation?

He's standing up for something bigger than u will ever understand.
Oooo Corndog...this tweet was a baaaaaad idea.
I see your tweets daily and all I can think is how excited I will be when you are out of office.
What are you going to do to impeach Trump? Texas deserves better than Cornyn and Cruz.
You do realize Trump has pretty much castrated the Republican Party, don't you?
Justice Thomas needs to transcend his reputation as a womanizer, sex addict, and serial harasser. Sorry. Might take some time. A lot of time
But hey - I'll support a monument to Anita Hill!
Stop. It.
Who's Thomas?
Oh, John. This is something you really, really should keep your mouth shut about.
Can you just stop it. U stoke the fires of hate when you tweet crap this.  Grow up Senator.  Are you 8? #stupidshitgopsays
The most innefectual president. Until now.
Wow how embarrassing for the Smithsonian African American Museum.
Your clumsy efforts to divide this base cheapens you further. Clarence Thomas is a lackluster justice appointed by an ineffectual president
We can't all be genius librarians.
Grow up.
Oh sure. The sexual harassment is fine to turn the cheek. I forgot that's the new Republican creed.
Indeed
You are seriously out of touch.
Wow. That joker has done absolutely nothing regarding civil rights. Screw him
What BS...this scum but NOT a SCOTUS Justice?  This kind of decision making keeps minorities down!
The Coke can with the Judges pube is in the Smithonian
and a disgrace to all Americans.
sickening.
Clarence Thomas is a sexual predator...so, your point?
Kaepernick stands for justice & Thomas is a liar & a sexual predator. You know. Anita Hill. She told the truth & St Ronald ignored her
You are a Senator.  The Smithsonian is a gov't institution.  Surely there is some way you can influence it rather than just whining about it
Dont like Kapernick...has rt 2 do whtever,  he must live W conseq of actions.  Cant stand my tax being spent on anything BLM unless its jail
WTF? Why not artifacts of Super Bowl champ #DougWilliams, HOF #WarrenMoon and not a despicable individual like #ColinKapernick
Yes I do know that he beat his wife which is inexcusable. Not model citizen, but amazing on the field, hence #HOF.
Not saying I disagree with u but we don't make those decisions. So it is what it is unfortunately
Pepaw Cornyn, you're woefully out of touch. And clueless. Thomas sexually assaulted a woman. Maybe in your day that would be overlooked.
Racism and narratives!
Boycott
Cornyn upset that someone who sexually harassed women will not be honored.  Cornyn hates anyone would protest the hate he works to spread
Sad but far more Americans can answer, "Who's the qb who kneeled during anthem?" than "Who's the African American Supreme Court Justice?"
Also sad is why he felt the need to kneel. What has our Senator done to heal this division? Be wishy-washy on NeoNazis. Not very helpful.
This PC Political COERCION must be stopped!!!!
Justice Thomas voted for Citizens United Colin K is true patriot & speak up for BML You are white supremacist!
Since you like to tweet articles so much about what is important to you. Under your watch. Care to comment?
When school’s out, rural Texas towns are struggling to feed their hungry kids. Fighting hunger takes a village. http://trib.it/2w9XkW0  

He's a better American than Clarence Thomas.  Never accused of sexual assault.
Maybe they could display Clarence Thomas wife's $686k worth of cashed checks from the GD Koch Brothers that bought his Citizens United vote
Why would you think it's a good idea to say something negative about this. You are truly a fool
They could put in a Coke can for Thomas...
Oh please calm down John!
Quit changing the subject. When are you going to denounce white supremacy?
https://www.texastribune.org/2017/08/15/federal-court-invalidates-part-texas-congressional-map/ ….     After the election. WTF
There you go with the right wing political correctness again.

His crying voice echoes in our ears till this day. 
Our hearts were with him every single moment until he got to the hospital. 

"No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion..."

#RestInPower Heather Heyer, who gave her life today in defense of liberty and justice for all. We will not forget you. #Charlottesville 

.@JohnCornyn - With Trump's record on Nazis, answer this for your constituents: Would you vote for him at all, in any election, today?
Whataboutism at it's finest
Anita Hill.
Silent Thomas? Maybe we should ask Anita Hill.
It's for African Americans only.
They don't have a famous Uncle Tom section.
thomas sexually harassed women in the workplace.  so yeah no.
Bc of his relevance in the #BlackLivesMatter movement (which article clearly states). Pls stop trying to spread misinformed rhetoric
We used to honor people who stood up. Now we are honoring blatant disrespect to our own country? Football is a game. #findarealjob
Ah, @JohnCornyn is showing his white sheet again.   Maybe posting up a picture collage with all your minority friends will help.
Really??? #sad #integtity
Pitiful
 Kaperdick's Caucasian Mother birth mother will find this odd, his black daddy is AWOL. His Caucasian adopted parents will also be dismayed
I think they were looking for his can of Coke with the infamous pubic hair.
For many of us who have put our uniformed lives on the line, there's a significant disparity in fairness with regard to what/whom is honored
Does everything have to be politicized the socialist fascist progressive way? Any public funds in Smithsonian? Any oversight other than BLM?
Wow. You're not really going there are you?  Say her name. Anita Hill
@smithsonian may have archived some information from Anita Hill Could be one answer
A lazy ass who was mad cuz he wasn't starting anymore - makes sense
He chose the wrong side of those many sides.
NOW you choose to speak out on race-related issues? But you couldn't bring yourself to censure .@POTUS for supporting #NeoNazis? 
#TooLate
Justice Thomas has backed decisions adversely affecting African Americans.  Why would he be in museum?
Have you always been this petty? I would say it's beneath a US senator but after our nazi sympathizer @POTUS I expect nothing more from @GOP
This is a travesty. Thomas is a hero, and the most important living defender of our constitution- which is the soul of our country.
Thomas has barely made a sound on the bench since he got there under highly questionable circumstances.
What do you have in mind? An exhibit with a Coke can?
Better a coke can than Bill Clinton's used cigars or altoids.
Your right, this isn't right. Now do something about it. Defunding would be an option. Many taxpayers would appreciate it
You're a sad sad man.
Ridiculous.
One more reason why many of US see govt & its related institutions as corrupt & inept.
MADNESS IN AMERICA
UFB!
Justice Thomas is certainly deserving in the Museum. I'm shocked not already.
NOT TO HARD TO I.D. WHO ARE IMBEDDED IN THE FED GOV!!! RADICAL SOCIALISTS WHO ARE PART OF THE DEMOCRAT PARTY!!!TERM LIMITS NOW!!! DRAIN DC!!
Defund it.
You are a Senator do something about it.
Geez Louise, keep clutching those pearls, dude.
Senator, where is Nat Turner’s Monument in the Capital Building? A Changing Legacy and a Memorial.
Senator, there are 19 Smithsonian Museums. You have publically objected to & or recommended the content of how many? ONE?
Please, can we get some unselfish, mature, statesman-like ADULTS in Washington D.C.? Americans need jobs, health, housing; not gossip!
Are you referring to Justice Thomas the sexual harasser?
This is your priority? Texas is ranked in the top 20 states with the highest poverty rate.  And one of the highest rates of child poverty.
That's why we need a wall
Is there a point here?
Senator John Cornyn Argues That High Minority Turnout Is Reason To Support Photo Voter ID
GOP Sen. John Cornyn says racial tensions are merely 'phony narratives'
You are petty. Please do your job.
Kaepernick is horrible example for children. He should be banned from football. If you don't like this country get out, we don't want you !
Best you remain quite on this subject. I don't recall you publicly condemning POTUS...on anything, Senator. Why's that, John?
You're pathetic
So, tell me, how is this tweet uniting America? How is it anything but PURPOSEFULLY sowing division? #gfy
you just do NOT get it, do you? #racist
I have Nov 2020 marked!  Can't wait to vote you out.
For what? He didn't say a word for 10 years
this talking point?
oral arguments are merely theater
he writes decisions all the time
which is what counts
John . John. John, stop
Justice Who?  He went 10 yr without even asking a question.  Has written only three opinions, and none in 15 yrs. A non-entity on the court
Opinions by Thomas. 3 in 26 years, plus a few concurring and dissenting. What does he do all day @tribelaw 

https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cases/judges/toj_thomas.html …
How about not whitesplaining what they should or shouldn't put in their museum?
Whitesplaining doesn't exist. Liberals frequently call Clarence Thomas an Uncle Tom. That's bigotry.
He was featured only briefly regarding his confirmation
Remember fam.. The senator been telling Black ppl and women what to do with their culture/bodies on daily basis. Old white men need control
I'm a fellow white person and even I know not to tell black Americans who and what they're supposed to honor.
You can criticize black people.
Clarence Thomas lied about Anita hill.
How about Anita Hill first.
Omg the constant whining from the right.. Your not an African American John.. And when was the last time Justice Thomas stood up for Blacks?
I'm sure he has a cabin they could put somewhere.
He has a bit of a point for once. It could go next to the Cosby exhibit. Sexual assault, sexual harassment, close enough.
This is a travesty! African American museum choices did not satisfy White Trump-Loving Senator John Cornyn from Texas!
One's a scholar and Supreme Court Justice who deserves honor. The other a mediocre NFL quarterback entertainer who pouts. No equivalence.
Will we need to kneel to see them?
Please tell me why you believe Justice Thomas should be included? Go ahead...I'm waiting. Can't wait to read your response on this!
He never responds to comments. He just tweets stupid shit and then goes quiet. What a coward. #WaitingForTheTownHall
You think a black Suprem Court Justice can't think for himself because you are a bigot.
Last I checked Colin Kaepernick has never been accused of putting his pubes on anything. Unlike Clarence Thomas.
So you are against the Clinton Presidential Library.
Didn't know u are the arbiter of all things African-American history with an emphasis on the BLM movement. Gonna trust the museum on this.
this is what our country has come to. WTH don't you & other GOP stand up &  SPEAK UP!  You and GOP  are chicken . Time to fight back!
Reward that Ahole for being disrespectful!
Justice Thomas has done nothing on SCOTUS except vote in concert with Scalia.
Thank goodness!
Race doesn't really matter, it's all a lie. The only thing that matters to liberals is that you are liberal. That's it, it's all bullshit.
What do you have against someone standing up for justice?
Let's ask Anita Hill what she thinks.
Funny enough, the museum has already focused on Anita Hill, while ignoring Clarence Thomas.
I've never been to the Smithsonian. When I can go to D.C., the weather is hot and muggy. On my bucket list.
All this mess going on because Republican leaders are Running Cowards don't Stand Together with President Trump, letting Swamp Run Them SAD
We've been over this before. There is no Uncle Tom wing of the museum.
And, theres that Liberal, Progressive Democrat racism that just can't be hidden.
That was my first and only thought about this "news," too.  Justice Thomas is one of the greatest defenders of the U.S. Constitution ever.
Thanks, Botty McBotBot.
You're welcome Betty McBotBot.
It's like you are concerned with everything except your own job
No, justice Thomas is a part of the GOP hateful agenda, plus he's a sexual predator
Prove that statement!!!!! U can't can u. Your so full of hate.Clinton is a Rapist and u condone it. Hypocrite!!!!
Finally something I can agree with you on.
Kaepernick is advancing the cause of black equality; Thomas hinders it.

Speaking of which, you and the Nazi-supporting @POTUS still buds?
Kaepernick called all police officers pigs in the weeks after multiple police assasinations.
He wore pig socks.
And then he said they specifically represented *bad cops.* Pedantic, but not what you posted, and his protest was an important statement.
Why are you base baiting? What does this have to do with Your constituents in Texas?
Do you walk to work or do you take your lunch?
Town Hall tomorrow ? Matts El Rancho would be a great place.
Grow up. Clarence Thomas isn't diminished when another black man is given his due. Kaepernick is being punished for protesting oppression.
He's getting punished because he's fucking awful
Good job letting your racist flag fly.
How about they send Kapernick stuff to Cuba & Include Justice Thomas rightfully int @smithsonian #justice
You're just the worst.
Sucks pretty dang bad.
Good point Senator! Why not discuss that with the curator and let us know?
They're probably trying to exclude sexual harassers.
You're so embarrassing.
