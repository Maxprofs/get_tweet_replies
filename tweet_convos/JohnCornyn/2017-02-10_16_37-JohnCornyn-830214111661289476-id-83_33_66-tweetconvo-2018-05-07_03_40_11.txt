Restoring some semblance of "balance" in federal court system will require an uninterrupted 12-16 yrs of full Republican rule. 
dems have had uninterrupted rule in fed courts since 1990..bushes were rhinos on fed judges....they believe in globalist policy
The only vacancy we want to see is the one you leave behind.
Oh, I want to see more than just his seat vacant.
Shh! Imma tryin scare him.
looking forward to your next town hall. When will that be exactly?
Well at least your characterizing your movement accurately. It is a "Republican rule". It's not a democracy that's 4 sure.
are these the same vacancies you blocked under Obama? I am a constituent - you'd be well advised to listen to us ALL.
24/7/365 appts on the fed courts...
it's not how fast you appoint them having the right person for the American people
.@JohnCornyn Do you really want to talk about vacancies and why they aren't filled? #SCOTUS #MerrickGarland #ShouldaDoneYourJob #2020
oh please God no.
In the dead of night? Crook Cornyn.
We're eager to see your vacancy soon too
gonna screenshot this for when you try to back away from him.
Not gonna happen
afraid to talk to largest city in Texas-- what happened to your integrity---too many pensions maybe
excellent John
yes, when is your next town hall?  And how do we schedule a face to face meeting?
, investigate Russia's involvement in this administration first!
that's a terrifying thought
.@JohnCornyn admits Republican goal is to politicize judiciary
You are not doing your job and neither are the other Repubs.  You will be held accountable for this dereliction of duty.
well you have the House and Senate. And the Executive. Some branch needs to look out for the rest of us.
we can discuss this at a #TownHall. When will you be in Montgomery County?
when will you be in Dallas?
Do it
Apocalypse in waiting.
@VRWCTexan John, split the 9th. PLEASE.
you keep holding your breath, fella. By God we intend to repeal and replace you asap. #LBJwouldRaiseHell
is this why we're not punishing Russia for hacking our election?
Maybe you should have gone to public school. This graphic clearly shows 12. #makeAmericaSmartAgain
these vacancies were left because of Republican obstructionism during Obama's terms.
I pray for an obstructive Democratic Congress. ~a constituent
America's judges should be just, fair, non-biased and apolitical.  Checks and balances. Did you take Civics in school?
stop the Keystone and Dakota pipelines!  Only 50 permanent jobs Invest in alternative energy for truly permanent jobs.
I'm working to defeat you.  I'm tired of you ignoring your constituents. #2020
@VRWCTexan U are insane if U think mentioning his name does anything but sicken us. U may have bought his lies but we haven't.
stop hiding from your constituents. Schedule town hall meetings & face your constituents. Coward.
ha
We The People need a true representative. Not someone motivated by greed or promoting Putin, Bannon & Trump's agenda.
I'm more interested in seeing inpendents filling those seats. Tired of Repub vs dem
you've let your constituents down. No way way to re-electing you or any @GOP. How about a town hall meeting to hear our words.
because he's done such a great job picking his cabinet? No thanks! Texas will remember your vote on DeVos and Sessions.
That's quite a challenge. How will he be able to find enough attorneys who worked at Goldman Sachs?
#draintheswamp
great move on this!
partisan hack? #2020 Shanahan Shanna hey hey hey goodbye john.
fill seats......lose yours. Bye John. #2020
How does 12 become 100+?
hey, maybe he will appoint you when we vote you out.
What in 45's actions makes you think you won't be sitting on a jury in the Senate long before he can nominate "so called judges"
When is your next town hall?
@VRWCTexan keep politics out of the courts
thought he was going to downsize Fed, which campaign promise is he failing at with Your support against what's best for Texas?
lol I'm betting "Trump Administration " were two words you never dreamed you'd have to say with feigned respect to keep your job
Republican Rule!? We have leaders, not rulers. Nation of laws, not men. A true conservative should not make that mistake.
@VRWCTexan because they were left open by your suddenly amnesiac obstructionist party
do you even feel a bit of shame for collaborating with this administration #youownthismess #notamericanvalues
at the rate this Republican administration is burning down the house, will we have a country in 16yrs? #NotHopeful
by "balance" do you really mean #RubberStamp ?
That doesn't sound balanced to me. esp w  Trump administration & its lemmings
> You're a patriot Senator.
so, more opportunities for unqualified, ethically challenged zealots to find employment? #WhatANightmare
And this is supposed to evoke what type of reaction?  #MyPresidentScaresMe #SaveMyCountry #ShipGoingDown #NotGood
Article I, Section 8; Article III, Section 1 allows congress to create 'inferior courts. Congress can disband them!
Just as well y'all ain't gonna last more than 4 years then...When's your next Town Hall?
Because of #RepublicanObstruction thru the last 8yrs those seats are empty.  Republicans have not shown concern for justice
We are going to oppose every one we can. How many judges want to hitch their wagon to his falling star?
oh, can i buy one?
Why don't you focus on qualified candidates instead of just republican ones? #CorruptCornyn
what is your secret that is so bad you are backing a man who sold out to a murderer years ago? We will wreck you, John.
if the choices were competent, qualified people might see different results.  Get us out of the tyranny of trump
U mean #Nazi #PresidentBannon?  That's so special.  Ruin the future.  #CleanAir #CleanWater #RoevWade #NoAuthoritairanRule
Vacancies due to 8 years of Republican obstruction.
Cry us a river; Your worthless party didn't even hold a vote on Garland; completely unprecedented.
#ElectionsHaveConsequences Billy-boy! #RespectTheResult #draintheswamp #MAGA  #ProgressivesAreTheProblem #Trump
wow. You're a really twisted SOB, aren't you. 

This isn't your country, John. You will never last 12-16 years.
No one wants to go near that filth - except maybe ppl like u that enjoy being a mob wife. Disgrace.
unless Senate Dems do to Trump what they did to Bush, and what Senate Repubs did to Obama and Clinton
