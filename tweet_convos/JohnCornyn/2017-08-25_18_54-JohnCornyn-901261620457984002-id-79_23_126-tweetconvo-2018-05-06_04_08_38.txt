.@JohnCornyn & @tedcruz urge @POTUS to grant @GovAbbott’s request for an expedited major disaster declaration in advance of #HurricaneHarvey 
Shame on you Senator John Cornyn.
About time, but he was busy pardoning and educating military commands and just forgetting hurricanes, lost sailors. What carelessness.
@WardDPatrick @tedcruz @POTUS @GovAbbott Where was your help to Sandy victims?
Not quite:
Why are you asking for this relief but was a vocal opponent of relief for other states? Genuine question....would like a genuine answer.
You've got a lot of nerve after letting Superstorm Sandy victims suffer while you play politics with people's lives. You are VILE.
After we recover from this terrible event, could you fulfill all of your responsibilities by meeting with your constiuents & announcing it?
But didn't you & @tedcruz vote AGAINST FEDERAL aid relief $$ after Hurricane Sandy for the NE?? A little hypocritically ironic???
The good Senator asks for what he voted to deny fellow Americans after Hurricane Sandy.
Great that you got this done! Now, how about, working to disempower the lunatic in the White House?  We all know he is an unstable disgrace!
@WardDPatrick @tedcruz @POTUS @GovAbbott remember both Ted & John voted against hurricane Sandy relief.
Good for Texans. Remember this when another state needs it
Ah, didn't you vote against aid for Sandy, you POS?
Yep...vote against it for other states but take it for Texas. Hypocrite.
Maybe next time this happens somewhere else, you will vote yes on funding for their state @JohnCornyn
How dare you. How dare you stand by and watch Arpaio pardon, trans ban, wall nonsense. How dare you.
Hurricane Sandy? “A man reaps what he sows.”  2 Corinthians 9:6, Galatians 6:7 #hypocrite
Amazing how quickly you asked for this & yet dragged your feet on Sandy! Thanks for showing your rank hypocrisy yet again.
Gee Johnny. That's actually a no brained for Donny. Think of the photo ops. What's your opinion on the transgender ban & the Arpaio pardon?
@GregAbbott_TX When you take money from the Feds who you supposedly despise remember @JohnCornyn & @SenTedCruz voted against Sandy relief.
Great, now get on with #ImpeachTrump before it's too late. We're becoming a white supremacist nation. Stop them, please!
Umm He just pardoned a racist who violated the constitution. #ImpeachTrumpNow
Remember #HurricaneSandy
Excuse me , but what do you have to say about Trump pardoning Arpaio ?
Remind me how you voted when E Coast hit by Sandy. Why is their hurricane less worthy than ours?
What was your position on Hurricane Sandy? Hypocrite much??
Remember when you said not to auth. Gov money for NJ after Sandy? Gave a to NJ? Don't be a hypocrite and handle this without Gov. handouts"
This is the one time I will not donate to a natural disaster to your previous positions with other parts of the country.
Amazing given you wouldn't support help after Sandy.
If you and that slime bag Murkowski only had the same urgency on Obamacare as you do grandstanding...
Why did you oppose the same for victims of Hurricane Sandy?
Y'all need to pull yerselves up by ur bootstraps&stop asking Feds for $$.  You told NJ&NY that during Sandy.That's what rainy day funds r 4.
Thank you for doing your job and announcing it.
While we're doing things, stand up for all members of our military #notransban and denounce the president's birther/racist #ArpaioPardon
Yes, yes you are. #2020
You are no one's friend but your own. HURRICANE SANDY remembers.
Great job! Thank you!!!
Why isn't your name on this letter?! Do you support white supremacists?!??  #HR496

#Censure #CensureTrump
Democratic Senators are asking DHS why the Trump administration repeatedly de-emphasizes domestic terror attacks. 
Why do you support this??! #Censure #CensureTrump #HR496
Hey, remember when Trump cut funding from the DHS's anti-extremist program, and specifically ended investigation of white supremacists? 
but first a Pardon.

What does @JohnCornyn care about Sheriff Joe, he's a racist too
May you and yours be safe.
You're a hypocrite.
he already said long ago he had their back
While I agree the federal government should help, you and Cruz asking is rich!
Next, keep on Trump to find a work-around to protect Santa Ana Wildlife Reserve in the RGV. That would be above and beyond.
@WardDPatrick @tedcruz @POTUS @GovAbbott Obama withheld disaster funds from Perry as political punishment, remember?

Texas senators who voted against aid for Hurricane Sandy ask for federal assistance ahead of Hurricane Harvey http://hill.cm/xHJJk36  
Surprised he found time between pardoning racist Arpaio, banning transgender troops & golfing. Let's drop POTUS in Corpus & see if he floats
Now do something really meaningful and urge @POTUS to resign.
I see why Trump signed #HurricaneHarvey declaration. Looking at request he probably thought he won all of them. Direct path was his.
Trump is a mobster, married to a former nude model. They are totally unfit to represent this country as the First Family. And you know it.
It's time for republicans to act...
don't pat yourself on the back too hard there, bud.
Well well
Both Senators John Cornyn and Cruz both voted against Hurricane Sandy relief. #p2 #tcot

Any thoughts on the pardon of Sheriff Joe or the trans ban? Or a public #TownHall ?
I hope your constituents get the compassion and  support  you failed to give to Sandy victims. But don't you dare take credit.
Whoa!
How abt standing up against the cowards pardon if a criminal in Arizona how abt that weak follower !
Just doing what should be done.
Brother John,
When #Assad's horde visibly guns for the #Golan, send me a tweet confirming you have #EyesToSee. I'll tell you the next part.

Cool!! Now tell him to resign - you have magic touch
As someone who thinks Texas should have immediate relief and assistance for this huricane, I must ask, why is this different than Sandy?
You certainly are Done. You let him loose. He will not help Texas and you know it. You are done.
If lying @tedcruz is looking in a mirror right now, he is seeing a hypocrite.
After he pardoned sheriff joe and signed the trans ban. And after you had to ask. But do go on.
Can you also encourage him to take this more seriously than he has the rest of his presidency so far?
That's fantastic. Hold millions of people responsible for two asshat senators. Two wrongs make a right here?
And? The people that needed funding for Superstorm Sandy were denied help by them, so... fair is fair, right?
Not to those people. THEY didn't deny Sandy victims anything. I guarantee you a lot of them donated their own money to help.
But do keep up there on your high horse. 
Please... my horse is a pony and it's dressage is awesome!
At least be funny.
At least be amusing.
Bullshit. When he wakes up tomorrow, he won't remember.
