The American Health Care Act Could Cause Loss of Nearly a Million Jobs
How many PEOPLE will John Cornyn kill with his odious bill and peddling lie that people don't want healthcare and will happily give it up.

We need #HealthCare 
Not #WealthCare$
how many jobs are lost due to the 22mil your kicking off of ACA for you AHCA, your plan is worse than Obamacare, so why downplay ACA?
it makes your own plan look that much worse when you attack ACA, when your CBO score is based on ACA vs AHCA and you lose more
I work in healthcare, we had to take over 3 other rural hospitals in the last 3 years, and your plan will definitely close down 2 of them.
then there's your job losses from loss of PP because you all defund it and women lose healthcare access in the millions there.
I don't think I've ever seen a more incompetent illinformed baseless statement in my life, russell are you related to FAKE cnn?? 
Tim is pushing the "fake CNN" stuff b/c he knows WaPo and CNN are sitting on a story at the behest of Mueller. The truth will come out!
EXACTLY unfortunately 4U LIBTARD'SL TRUTH has already come out so go back to your LIBTARD SAFE SPACE with LYING @CNN as your HW BOTTLE
Texans are quite clear that #BCRA is a massive transfer of wealth to the rich. You don't care if we live or die as long as Obama is erased.
You liberal never trumpers are the most hatefilled incompetent illinformed POMPOUS ASS'S ive ever had the displeasure of reading tweets from
Climb out from under your rock, and read a newspaper. Russia hacked our elections to install him in the WH. Have a shred of patriotism.
News paper? REALLY??? You are obviously one of the incompetent FRAUDULENT FAKE media MEMES LMFAO@U LYNYY BABY
With an additional 22 million w/o healthcare that won't be the biggest issue you will face. Baby boomers life savings will vanish in mos.
funny because unemployment went from 9% to 4.5% under Obama & Obamacare. Sorry liar.
Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs predicts bigger job losses if ACA is repealed:
That estimate pales in comparison to health related jobs lost under your current plan. https://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/2017/06/14/health-bill-stifle-texas-job-growth-report-says …
How many people will you kill with #WealthCare?!
How many people will trumpcare kill?
Really, John? You're going there? Placing job creation over American lives? Shameful, even for you. And that's saying a lot.
I've ceased to be amazed at the swampy depths @JohnCornyn is willing to stoop to. At least he's not pretending anymore. #hack
Kills maybe 250K jobs.  How many jobs will Trump/Ryan/McConnell/CornynCare kill?  Maybe 3M.  Can @JohnCornyn guess which number is higher?
If you truly believe this why don't you hold a town hall over the recess and answer the hard questions from your constituents?
States that didn't expand like TX are hurting hospitals with higher rates of uncompensated care; it affects EVERYONE
You're on the wrong side of history here, Bud.
Thank you @JohnCornyn , for showing us again, what a disgrace & embarrassment you are to our state
Probably none, rather more people with Health Insurance increase employment in health services.
When's the last time anyone here defended @JohnCornyn ???  what a 
That is more partisan bull.  Does hurting several million people not cause you spiritual pain?  Are you oblivious to their pain?
Utter garbage. Goldman Sachs counts the number of healthcare jobs alone added by the ACA at 500k
Obamacare coverage in MA: 96%
Unemployment in MA: < 4%
Job killing?  Nope!
BULL 
Such a well thought out and reasoned rebuttal.
Yea just like the FAKE numbers that said @realDonaldTrump had NO path to be @POTUS why don't you libtards step out in TRUTH stop WHINING
And by the way, they said it was a narrow path. In case you missed it, more ppl voted against him than for him.
Awe look another inept effort to spew FAKE numbers 
It's even funnier considering you used "awe" incorrectly in your tweet while you had the correct spelling right in front of you.
Awwwwwwweyou incompetent LIBTARD'S R obviously focused on irrelevant issues

NEW: From researchers at George Washington University: Senate Trumpcare would cost 1.45 million jobs by 2026.

How many PEOPLE will #BCRA kill?
You want to kill my brother. I love my brother. What did he do to you John?
#savemedicaid
How callous; People's health/lives be damned? You, and your Republicans have lost your place; I'm a Texan, born and raised; we're watching.
BCRA costs Texas 26200 jobs in 2026 per commonwealth study.
Okay. You have got to stop. We know, okay? We know who and what gop supports.  You are only digging a deeper hole.
How many jobs does it kill? None. We had 75 months of job growth under Obama.
How many lives will DumpsterCare cost?
None... How many people will GOP/Trumpcare bill kill?
How many will die thanks to your #deathpanel deciding they don't need healthcare?  Why do you hate America?
So single payer then. Great, glad to have you on board.
How many jobs will your GOP plan kill?
How many #lives does it save? How many millions of #Americans does it #cover? Does your bill do that? The #CBOSCORE doesn't suggest so
how many jobs will bcra kill when hospitals close? How many ppl does bcra kill? 217000 by 2026!
Wages kill jobs to? We should reintroduce slavery since many more people would be employed and the free loaders would get off back side
Ahem.

And about 100,000 would be Texas jobs. We get hit hard by the Republican plans.
How many jobs will your "health" "care" bill (aka tax cut for yourself) kill?
Rural hospitals depend on the ACA.
How many people does Trumpcare kill in the first year alone? 18,000+ per @washingtonpost 

More than all terrorist attacks on US soil.
How many PEOPLE would @GOP #Trumpcare kill?
@JohnCornyn please stop beating a dead horse here and do something meaningful
Not as many people as you will with your stupid last minute Republican plan. 8 years you have had to make a master plan.
"...ACA repeal would result in 1.2 million fewer jobs by 2019 than would have been created otherwise."
How many did it create?
0=Zero. GOP voters are the only idiots that believe that. The rest of us access the truth. TX economy fueled by growth in healthcare jobs.
How many jobs does it create? Ask rural hospitals how much $ and many jobs they will lose under the ACA repeal. For tax cuts for the rich?
You have an F- on http://numbersusa.com   the only people you care about are illegals, Chamber of Commerce and lobbyists. Put America 1st
So @JohnCornyn is pushing a "survey" bereft of statistical significance to advocate stripping 20+ million Americans of healthcare?  @WSJ
But I guess unemployed people did *lose* their jobs they are *choosing* to be unemployed, right John?
Your health bill would slow job growth by 409,000 in 2019, by 1.1 million in 2020, by 1.6 million in 2021, and by 1.8 million in 2022 (EPI)

How many jobs does the AHCA kill?

22 million.

According to the CBO.
Now, how many jobs did it create? I know multiple ppl who started small businesses b/c they were no longer tethered to corps d/t benefits.

So 250,000 jobs & a tax cut for millionaires is worth 22 mill not having HC. That's what I love about you Republicans. One sided as always.
Vs. How many people can #BCRA kill? Come on!! #SaveACA #countrybeforeparty #resist
Lying comes easy to you people, because I've seen nothing, but jobs created.
Do Republicans ever not lie or mislead Americans?! Kicking 22M off insurance is going to hurt jobs of actual Americans!! #GOPFail #GOPLies
Not as many as your HC bill will
It's not about jobs Senator, it's about health care.
How many health industry jobs will be lost if you can get the vote through? A fees days early, weren't you? #25thAmendmentNow #Shitgibbon
How many humans does Trumpcare kill?
The #AHCA &#BCRA is a sham, and nobody wants it. Look at the numbers, at the lives, & lack of support. #LegislationWithoutRepresentation
This must explain the sky-high unemployment that occurred after the HCA was enacted
How many jobs will your bill kill when rural hospitals and NHs shit down?
*Shut down. But honestly, your bill is a shit down too. 
How many jobs are lost if ACA is killed?
You are making good argument for single payer.  What burden employers with health care role at all?
Yeah, tell all that to the healthcare workers who  lose their jobs when their local hospital goes under.
How many people will Trumpcare kill? Might be a bigger question
How many rural hospitals will shut down with your plan? That helps retain jobs how?
So you're saying your bill CREATES jobs? How exactly? I don't see that in the CBO report.
You guys control every branch of government yet can't pass anything better.  Be a leader for Texas and not a puppet for @realDonaldTrump
How many lives will be affected when you give them "Freedom" from their healthcare?
Come on John, your song is getting old.  Short of giving a tax cut for your wealthy friends come up with some fresh ideas.
Hopefully just yours.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/policy-and-politics/2017/7/5/15873438/senate-health-bill-job-losses … Please stop misinforming your constituency. It's dishonest and disheartening.
When AHCA is implemented # of hospitals, JOBS and care will be lost in rural areas? Not surprised...but not honest! Let's talk..townhall?
- And yet still only 12% of Americans want BCRA instead. BCRA is a disaster. Scrap it & start over. Have "fulsome" debates
That will never happen. It would require them to act like adults, and do their job. They want unilateral legislation to benefit their agenda
I believe GOP is killing Obamacare.  Not supporting the Act in place currently is wrong
A reason for single payer so avoid hurting small business, shutting down hospitals, healthcare workers keep jobs. Win-win. Find better way.
Ocare has let me work for a small bus who can't afford to provide insurance. What's your plan for those like me, Senator?

-Your Constituent
@JoeNBC @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @GOP @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @RepKevinBrady   How many people will the AHCA hurt or kill Senator Cornyn? 2020!

Fewer than were projected for BCRA.
How many PEOPLE does #BCRA kill?
Let me guess...so you're going to repeal without replacing?  You've had 7 years, Senator. And you have nothing. Let 'em die?? Loser.
And how many PEOPLE does Trumpcare kill? But who cares if people die, right?
Not surprising. Here's an interview I did with a business owner about a year ago on how Obamacare impacted his biz.
U were on the BCRA committee what R U doing to FIX @MSNBC @indivisibletxjc @CNN @indtx36 @DFWIndivisible @IndivisibleTeam
And how many PEOPLE will Trumpcare kill? Which is more important?
Liar! #NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare #BCRA  #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
To be clear, Obamacare isn't failing. @realdonaldtrump is sabotaging it. 
Trumpcare losing 3 mil jobs, $1.5T in gross state products, & $2.6T in total business activity
What's sad is that it is rather obvious no one but you and 12% of the population support the train wreck of a bill you are proposing.
and never mind the hospital closures that help the poor, never mind the burden on ERs, never mind the lost productivity of sick
Isn't this because business owners value profits over their employees?
Cook county noted that b/c of expansion, revenue has helped hospitals hire extra staff that help work with patients change behaviors
You have no care how many jobs are lost with AHCA. As long as you deliver tax breaks to The Koch Brothers and you collet your check
He has me blocked. Pls tell him if medicaid shifted to TX we will end up w income tax & lots of dead ppl.
How many veterans did dictator Obama murder?
and never mind rural hospitals, which will likely be forced to shut down because of not being funded....
How many lives does the GOP want to get rid of?  Koch Bros pushing you and the others pretty hard?
and never mind the loss of jobs for those who will be too sick to work  because of no health care coverage...
"experts at G.Wash.Uni. estimate that 912,000 health care workers in the US could lose...jobs [under the Senate bill]."
More propaganda. It's getting old John. No one wants your plan. Go by and be bipartisan for once
How many lies must Cornyn speak? 99.99% of everything from his mouth. His focus on destroying healthcare is disgusting. A Trump puppet
Think of another angle: you kill ACA & its coverage of average Texans, and your job is on the chopping block.
Covfefe?
