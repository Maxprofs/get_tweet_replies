Great Flag & State
If you love Texas then stop trying to help Russia via Putin's puppet, Donald J. Trump.
The 1980's called. It wants it's foreign policy back.
Hope to visit Texas for longer than to change planes.
Awesome Texas
@geolandman 

Down with All Flags.
To begin with the Texas flag.
STUPID.
@GovAbbott
Each bar is to be twice as long as it is wide. Texas flag makers need to be reminded, they aren't correct.
maybe you'd like to add a cross or something religous to our flag, since you're so insistent on forcing your religion on us
.@GregAbbott_TX is this the TX you support as a state of the US or as its separate country because we get confused.
:We have the BEST flag in the whole country!!!
Mr. Governor.  We are blessed that you are running our great state!
@GovAbbott Did you threaten to remove our elected Sheriff Hernandez? Not American, not Texan of you!!
@GovAbbott power to the people #wewillfight the Nazis emboldened by oppressive Trump's #putinspuppetregime
