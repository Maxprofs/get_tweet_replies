@stevenmnuchin1  WITH ECONOMICS, OK BOY TELL THEM TRUTH WHETHER
.@JohnCornyn @transition2017
Cornyn is my Rep and he blocked me.
@GOPSenFinance Talk to him about foreclosure on 90-yr olds for 27 cent error!!
@MMFlint
Wait for it little southern girl. Wrong side HX again
Community banks have suffered. Cannot even make a loan to a small business without going through hurdles
thanks partner, and NO NEED to read this about foreclosures, seniors, and #Texas, okay?! https://www.google.com/amp/dfw.cbslocal.com/2014/11/21/103-year-old-north-texas-woman-fights-to-keep-her-house/amp/?client=safari â€¦ #AARP #Houston
you are kidding right? RELIEF TO banks? You aren't there for the banks you are there for "we the people".
At this stage, the job of Sec Treas seems to consist of sitting in ugly, high backed chairs chatting with #OWM.
Great job on FSB sanctions, cyber unit purged, usher in new GOLDEN (shower) Age for CCCP. Go Sub-prime Munchkin!
@stevenmnuchin1  and how many times did he lie?
@stevenmnuchin1 you must NOT confirm this banker. You will damage Texas republican votes in 2018 and 2020. This is your warning.
This man does not know about community assistance, he destroyed people's lives for his own wealth!
Steve Will U reinstate Glass Steagall like Trump promised? Yes or no?
@stevenmnuchin1
@GOPSenFinance so, not foreclosure fraud? Did you talk about his historic foreclosure fraud? I don't see "foreclosure fraud"
@stevenmnuchin1 A HEBREW SERVANT TO ROME BETTER THAN ANY OTHER TRUMP WILL OBEY TRUTH AS ALL HICKS IN HERE ESP REPS

@stevenmnuchin1 ok you've taken your victory lap Mr Mnuchin: now get to work because talk even on WS is cheap.
Criticism for aggressive foreclosure practices
 OneWest was criticized for aggressively foreclosing on homeowners.
Great job Senator CORNHOLE!
make sure @realDonaldTrump  doesn't grab ur wife by the pu$$y
@stevenmnuchin1 two very disconnected people. Come see the real world. You wouldn't survive. #crooks
how about the 90 year old woman he foreclosed over 27 cent mistake? Is your idea of relief tossing elderly into street if they make mistake?
@stevenmnuchin1 OF COURSE THEY RECOGNISED ME
@stevenmnuchin1 ASK NATO ARTILLERY OBSERVATION POST IN DALMATIA
@stevenmnuchin1 BLONDIE IN ANY ENCOUNTER WITH ROME IN DARK HALLWAYS OF PURE POWER AMERICA BECOMES BITCH OF ROME
@stevenmnuchin1  THE BONEHEADS LIKE IT OR NOT CHURCHILL WRECKED
@stevenmnuchin1  BRITAIN WHEN HE CAVED IN STRONG POUND CONSRERVATIVE GOLD FREAKS N BALDWIN. NO PROMISES PLEASE
@stevenmnuchin1 We must have #GlassSteagall to #maga, not a bandaid of "TaxRelief" @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle @howtodoit1
happy days for wall street
He was hammered at 11am btw. 
#Deplorables r NOT fans of #Trump's treasury pick-Mnuchin has previous close ties to Soros!

@transition2017 I hear the democrats decimated small banks.
@howtodoit1 #Glass-Seagall ONLY way to fix & Executive order saying banks cant repo cars, homes in collapse
We don't want the Swamp Trash in the treasury.
... Relief for "Community Banks" sure sounds like your normal liberal tendencies.. "Bailout" .. Let the free market work!
Trump promised #GlassSteagall Let's unite in THAT and hold @stevenmnuchin1 to it...for our children's and God's sake!
how about relief to the working class in Texas who shoulder so much burden to simply eek by?
#Fanniegate
I'm sure you did!  Lining your pocket while us "peasants" suffer.
I'm poor, but I'm no peasant!
Just referring to the way the GOP treats people. Nothing personal.
Where is "relief for community banks" found in the Constitution?
Over-regulation always hurts small business, even banks.
If @JohnCornyn is speaking of regulation then I agree; I was interpreting "relief" as financial relief... informed by history...
did you speak to the nominee about potential conflict of interests in his background and potential position?  #watching
Perhaps a climate scientist for Treasury?
Rocking it!!
@stevenmnuchin1 Hopefully, relief will come for community banks and GSE investors who have both been wronged by prev US Treasury
Glad to $ee where your value$ are.
hey chief, instead of ensuring bankers get taken care of, how about you focus on schools and vets?
Why don't you let him take the oath of office first. Chief
cornyn has been a senator for several years already slick 
Did you talk about the widespread misconduct found at a bank he headed?
Trump promised #GlassSteagall Let's unite in THAT and hold @stevenmnuchin1 to it...for our children's and God's sake!
did that conversation include the repeal of the Dodds act by chance?
did you ask about relief for the common folks & small business owners like myself???
don't count on it
all talk, no action!
@PatrickSvitek Seriously?!?! That's not good. #WeDeserveBetter
This is the guy that went on a vicious foreclosure spree and exploited the public's vulnerabilities to push them down more.
You realize people don't get foreclosed on if they pay their mortgages, right?
also next time u try 2defend a bank,might check it out first. OneWest already taken out amid stacks of violations
Did OneWest's foreclosure mill come up in that discussion? Or Goldman's involvement in the 2008 Financial Crisis?
he left Goldman in 2002
