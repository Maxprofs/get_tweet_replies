Thanks for ruining the Texas horse industry with your casino lobbyist money. You will get no votes from horse owners.
Praise be. Under His eye.
Then you must be part of those we need to vote OUT....
Top three reasons to vote for whoever is running against you.
Check out @smilder He’s running in the primary.
Where is his campaign page? I can't find it. I want to donate. I'd elect a potato over Dan.
@smilder will have his page up soon. I’ll drop the link here when he does. :)

Hell no- why aren't you in jail? Aren't you under investigation?
I am so proud to announce I'm going to help your opposition.
I’ve been a GOP State delegate the past several years, & I’m casting my vote for @smilder for Lt. Gov. & @SpeakerStraus if he runs 4 Gov
I could get behind those two
I’m with Dan! @TXlege
#ReElectDanPatrick @DanPatrick @TeamDanPatrick #LieutenantGovernor #2018Election #KeepTexasRed Working tirelessly for Texas! 
You forgot to mention you are endorsed by casino money. I am a die hard Republican, you won't get my vote.
An endorsement from Abbott and Cruz is great. An endorsement from Cornyn? Not so much. Congrats anyway.
What a proud moment for bigots everywhere.
Crazy knows crazy.
Yeah no thanks
Remember HB 2190? You helped gut HFD's Pension. Don't expect support from Fire Fighters.
or teachers!
Thank you, Dan Patrick, for making an especially confirmed, dedicated, check-writing Democrat outta me. Appreciate ya.
Lotta good your money is doing. Why not just cut to the chase and flush it down the toilet?
Thanks so much for your insightful comment. It's remarks like these that make Twitter what it is. Best always.
The 3 stooges 
That's nothing to brag about ... you all need to be voted out!
Do you all have matching t-shirts that say, I'm with bigots?
I'm glad but wouldn't brag about Cornyn's endorsement! He is a Communist pond scum. He has put a hold on Russ Voight's nomination!
#ReElectDanPatrick @DanPatrick @TeamDanPatrick #LieutenantGovernor #2018Election #KeepTexasRed Working tirelessly for Texas! 
In a normal world that would have been the kiss of death!
From the bathroom guy.
No vote from me because you don't understand the part about Separation of church and state
Kewl, kewl..... so I’ll be voting for your opponent then.
Really?  Those are 3 guys I'd go a long way to avoid!
3 more reasons to vote against you!
When the hateful left is unhappy, that means good things are happening for Texas.
Not much of an endorsement...
Impressive. #DanPatrickResign
Hard to understand why u r proud to b endorsed by hate and ignorance!
Endorsement or not, teachers have a different plan. #BlockVote @smilder
That’s 3 good reasons to vote for someone else.
I'm with @GovAbbot & @Ted Cruz, but @JohnCornyn's days are numbered so you should disavow his endorsement. Sinking ship!
None of you will have my vote
BTW, you're going to cost Tx the new Amazon HQ because of your bizarre pissing fantasies.
Nope. Enough of the wild-eyed carpetbagging radio host w/ the fake name. Go back to wherever you came from, because it sure as hell isn't TX
@whitneychagnon doesn’t like you I don’t like you
Those might be the only 3 votes you get.
You are the most narrowminded, women hater negative POS and I can’t wait to vote you out!! Ty for alerting me!!
JFC these guys are the four horsemen of the apocalypse.
Make a venn diagram of the worst three politicians in Texas and you have Dan Patrick in the juicy juicy middle
Three good reasons to bid you adieu at the polls
Then you definitely need to go, like out of Texas!
Dude, that's not really something to be proud of....
Don't be.
You don’t get my endorsement. I’m voting for anyone on the ballot who is not you.
Pride goeth before a fall.
Whoa. Nice line up.
Party-over-country. And state. SSDD
2 good reasons to vote for your opponent
But not by any teacher groups. We plan to #blockvote for @smilder
No thank you
3 idiots endorsing a 4th Idiot  to suck on taxpayer tit and do nothing for another session....wow didn't see that one coming .....Shocker
@JohnCornyn Wow!  Unbelievable that anyone would endorse Dan Patrick after his "bathroom bill" fiasco!  You all need to #Doyourjob
Three very good reasons to vote against you! (As if there weren’t enough already)
Bigots, liars, and cowards.
This makes me ill
Sad day for Texas.
When teachers unite to vote, you are gonzo.
That's nothing to be proud of.
Gross

Gross.
The party of treason, bigotry & hate. No thanks.
Last I checked he's not a Democrat.
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no nope!
Wow, all three stooges. Nyuk nyuk nyuk for you. #TurnTexasBlue #Beto2018
You’ve been endorsed by literally everyone I will be voting against. Congrats!
#TXneedsnewblood
Slim pickings I see
Well, Dan, as a republican Texas voter, I'll make you a deal.  Support any challenger to Ted Cruz, R, D or Other, and I'll vote for you.
Sucks to be you. Cruz and Cornyn are partisan hacks.
Vomit. You’re a disgrace to the office.
I truly hope #MikeCollier wins
Three stooges
Kind of of disappointed in the Cornyn endorsement, figured you'd want to support a conservative like @DwayneStovall? @NotOnThisWatch
I support @CollierForTexas for Lieutenant Governor of Texas!
Me too!
I support @smilder
You’re all awful. Perfect endorsement for you John. #PeasInAPod
Wow. I’m kind of appalled by the lot of you. PS: I live in Texas, I vote and lots of people feel as I do.
Congrats for also picking up the endorsements of Bigotry and Hate!
Oh Jesus. I’d kind of rather you just go away and find a job harassing another state.
Helluva job on that Bathroom Bill, helluva job. 
It's too bad you can't keep better company than Abbott, Cruz, and Cornyn. I AM A TEXAS VOTER.
Oh god fucking no!
good luck with getting reelected....need to find a running mate to replace Strauss.

Yes, take a bow Congrats!
Proud? Every one of that trio is a jack ass.
But not from your constituents.
Is @GregAbbott_TX going to give you some of his #bots?
And this surprises you why? Our great Governor knows who the BEST is!!  You have my vote!!'
Remember your promises.......   LOWER MY PROPERTY TAXES!!!!

But not by me!
God help us!
Four fuckin cowards. No wonder you run in packs
That's a great team, if you like corrupt cowards and bigotry.
