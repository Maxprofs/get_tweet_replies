Too bad the aforementioned agenda is a LIE.  Prevarication pure and simple.
many of us would prefer having the wall over having you as our senator.
We want an actual wall and to be clear, we will vote you out if we don't get it.
Who's "we?" Do you have a mouse in your pocket?

If ever a US senator wore the long face of the "GOP #Establishment"--it's Cornyn!
Then get with the program Hypocrite Cornyn -BUILD THAT WALL the Americans have spoken

I'm from Texas and I voted for a border wall when I voted for Trump Sen. Cornyn.
NOBODY SAID IT WAS JUST A WALL AND TRUMP SAID THAT FROM DAY ONE, LIAR.

Cornyn: important trade deals w Mexico - re wall??
He huddled w Schumer, McConnell+Ryan? Uh-oh, we need new whip
 @FoxNews
Yes, Senator, we wanted a wall. Really, we did.
Let's not forget Cornyn voted 4 the Secure Fence Act of 2006 but now he's against finishing it?
Put lying @JohnCornyn in the RINO basket with mccain & graham & send them packing! #MAGA @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews
I listened to him on your show. I did NOT gather from his words that he supports pres.
WALL. WE WANT A WALL. TO BE CLEAR, A WALL. A BIG, BEAUTIFUL WALL. CHANTED #BuildTheWall SO, WALL

Yes, Senator we wanted and want THE WALL. Ask us, the Americans next time, don't assume
Cornyn- You can't  support President if decision- "up to u & ur best jdgment" WTH? @notmysenator
All these TXN R's in State & US Capitol are agst REAL BORDER! Abbott, Perry & Bush too. #awake
A Texan that voted for a WALL! I voted straight ticket (R) to help Trump get it DONE!
John thinks the people voted for his judgment instead of a wall.  Cornyn wanted amnesty
Cornyn is a liberal liar! TEXANS want a WALL! We hate Cornyn and will replace him. RINO
Flynn's 40k from Russia. How much 45 give U 1-19-17 CNN on live air? Or did U have $ from Russia too?

WOW-liar @JohnCornyn what you said FOX tonight-"U would use "ur best jdgment" re: Trump's wall. WTH
Cornyn is full of shit. He says people don't want a wall. Ignoring voters AGAIN.
he doesn't want a wall because that fixes the problem he wants the status quo PRIMARY!
Cornyn is the swamp wish you told him for us !
I'm a Texan and I want Senator Cornyn to know majority of Texans want a wall?
.@TuckerCarlson And that agenda includes BUILDING A WALL. Senator you are out of touch to think otherwise. @JohnCornyn @realDonaldTrump
@POTUS 
His 'we haven't confirmed cabinet cuz he hasn't nominated sub-cabinet' defense was a riot!
sorry wrong John cornyn we want a wall anywhere it can go. Everybody legal wants it.
John Cornyn is not on board with the wall or @POTUS.  Drain him!
Next time ask "You've had 8 yrs. to put together a health care plan, where is it?"
Is the GOP deliberately jeopardizing  our President's campaign promises?
John, part of the problem is that you guys hardly work but you party on others dime
JohnCornyn and his GOP good ole boys are gonna screw us again.
No they won't! Pay attention & get out to vote when its time.Never stop!
TX does want a big beautiful wall!
Right....that's why they are on a constant vacation.  These people have got to go.
If #Cornyn supported ALL of the #POTUS agenda,he would not say no to a WALL on live TV!
Senator, you seemed to be waffling a bit during the interview.
Judging by all these tweets from just a few minutes on TV, an awful lot of people saw what I did. #snakeoil

"Working" is a relative term for Congress!
I & My Big FAMILIA voted for THE WALL & PRES TRUMP. Texas will be saying Adios to John.
That better be 100%!
nice to know you're being honest about your racist agenda

@ChristieC733 @TuckerCarlson @JohnCornyn @realDonaldTrump I can't agree with you more@FoxNews
his agenda is bs and you know it
We voted for a wall.

Sen Cornyn see you on a recall ballot.  By the way weren't you part of the gang of 8?

Tucker, this is what Real Texans want..The RINO JC to follow President Trump's orders..
.  I'm from Texas everyone I know wants a wall
@djtmaga2017 @TuckerCarlson @JohnCornyn @realDonaldTrump @ss @FoxNews
of course John does. Just another lapdog ignoring constituents.
need a physical wall so future Dems can't just easily decide to have an open border.
Well..part of the agenda is the Wall.
I'm in South Texas. Cornyn lost my support. Out of touch & lazy. TxGOP start looking!
This guy basically said his constituents in Texas are stupid. We want a Great Wall!! 
Built in the 1400s over mountains

Mongols breached and went around the wall to conquer china. Nice try
Then YOU @JohnCornyn and those like you ARE the problem.

The border wall is one likely reason for the obvious slow-walk in Congress.  Sad!
RECALL @JohnCornyn
As a Texan, We Want the Wall!!!!
I live in Texas. No to wall!!
Trump Cucks have no choice
I want names of dems who skipped Trump speech
maybe Cronyn needs to be on the other side of the wall when it's built
This Texan voted for the wall, NOT some Senator's "better" judgement. Great job Tucker!
BTW what's your response to your #deepstate staff who voted for #hillary???
Walls DO work Senator.  Ask our Israeli friends if you need a reminder.

glad you showed the people of Texas your true colors. Good luck being reelected.
Cornyn, you dolt, we voted for a BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL- not more political nonsense.
Go Tucker! Cornyn better watch his rhetoric. Build the damn wall!
Houston wants a wall!
What the hell do they do all day? He sucks
This Texan doesn't support this RINO!
Recall this SOB @johncornyn
Cornyn spouting the old mantra. The wall won't work???
WE WANT A WALL, WHAT DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND.. WE VOTED FOR IT NOT UP FOR INTERPRETATION
I am not buying @JohnCornyn & he clearly was trying to throw @POTUS under bus !
Let's RECALL @JohnCornyn NOW (get started while he vacations)!
Cornyn is worthless...vote him out !What part of build the wall do you not understand?

<<< 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China â€¦

Built circa 1400 AD

You just don't want to build it!
Sen Cornyn with all due respect that was BS. You R why we voted for Trump. DO YOUR JOB
thank you John Cornyn!
Thanks for holding his feet to the fire, but I don't believe anything the hack said.
You represent the people of Texas. We voted for Pres. Trump,we want the wall!
Technically, he represents the STATE of Texas. Not the people.
Fine. He is still wrong.
That wasn't my point. Just his job title.
the Dems r ass hurt 4 their beating during the election. They seek 2 uproot our nation
Senate works 10 days in a month!? He needs time to show people cliffs on border-try google maps!
China built this in 1400s. Don't tell me we can't, too!
@jsull123 @HollyHillio @TuckerCarlson @JohnCornyn and it goes over EVERY type of terrain except water
I live in San Antonio, TX and we voted for President Trump's WALL. We want the wall!!!
Cornyn wouldn't use the word Wall, instead a physical barrier. Why politicians are scum
U aren't working hard enough.  No time off, work OT.  4% bill approval unacceptable.
You lie. Get off your butt and get the job done.Conservatives are watching you.
##MAGA
Also Corynyn is afraid of losing his job!
term limits!!!
It was hard to watch Cornyn and not throw something at the TV. Is he for real? Idiot.
is so out of touch with Texans. We Voted to #BuildTheWall so #BuildTheWall John dumb
Personally, as a Texan, I can't say I expected a literal wall but I expect lots of enhancements.
Many border towns already have a wall, check Google Maps, you can see it's shadow.
I voted for a wall, not for you @johncornyn or anyone else to use your best judgement!!
TEXAS voter here! Yes, we DID vote for a physical barrier!! Have you lost your mind?!
Don't even think about Dem co-op. Just handle it. Really give them a reason to cry.
Texas res here. To build a wall you have to take private land! Harder than taking guns from us.
All pipelines are built on private land. Every heard of right of way?
