I'm less of a Cornyn fan now. Sure, get well...but we don't need JM who ran a 9 mo Russian hoax, causing war. #Texas #Republican #Vote2018

#FusionGPS #McCain #Russiahoax The start of a fake conspiracy that is leading to war with Russia.
Another #PutinBot @TeaPainUSA has plans for them.
@ToniTagliarino @JohnCornyn @YouTube
Dems blame Russia for last fail. Once #NewRepublicans win '18, who you think will be to blame? Old Republican. No party distinction here.
Muting every #PutinBot
Too early on a Sunday to read negative, divisive Tweets. @TeaPainUSA @ToniTagliarino
If your going to be negative and call real people bots while you hide behind a flower, it's too early for you to be online.
Sen. McCain should just retire!  A detriment to everything we voted for in 2016!!

JUST IN: Insurance industry says Cruz amendment will unleash a death spiral for people with pre-existing conditions. 

@JeffFlake Our patients say #ProtectOurCare! 73,000 children gained coverage due to Medicaid exp, Don't take it away. #KeepKidsCovered 
What insurance plan is John McCain using? It better not be a public healthcare plan.
Thank U 4 your service. We need your leadership now more than ever. Grateful U have excellent care. Lots of  prayers
Cornyn please!!!

The ACA repeal bill threatens the wellbeing of our families & communities. Call your Senator: http://bit.ly/2tlqr7n   #ProtectOurCare 

"I'm begging, Senator Heller" - This woman is battling stage 4 cancer and Trumpcare at the same time 
put McCain onTrump Care, the  same plan public will receive when you screwup the ACA.  Fix the ACA, make it work.
Aren't you glad that he had high quality preventative care? Shouldn't all of have access to this? #FixACA #NoRepeal
I'm sure glad he has great health insurance-convenient that you all remove your insurance from your proposal for ours.

"Somebody needs to listen to us." Activists are bitter that they're not able to take videos. Staffer says it's an office policy. 

This is seven-year-old Myka, who was born with a congenital heart defect. I’m fighting for children like Myka each and every day. #SaveACA 
You must know you have his vote in your pocket to say. We need you more than ever John. What a shame to think people can't see the message.
Voting to keep your insurance but take it away from Texans is a disgrace. You and @tedcruz are an embarrassment to Texas.

Children’s hospitals agree: the Republican health care bill would be devastating & have life-or-death consequences.

32 #cancer orgs, representing pts & providers, ask Senate to vote NO on #BCRA. Add your voice, call Senators. (844) 257-6227 #ProtectOurCare 
Ain't it great to have good healthcare? Please don't take ours away!!!!!
What we need is for him to RETIRE!!! He DOES NOT work for   GOP but the Dems. And if you think otherwise you are the same and need to go too

Cancer survivor shares with staffers of GOP Rep. Lamar Smith a powerful story about how Obamacare helped extend the life of a friend. 
Please help those of us without insurance to get the same care you did..witb the same deductible
Mayo Clinic... meanwhile our Veterans die on waiting lists... 
That's rich! You are Trussian.

Fixing healthcare takes putting us, we the people, before your party! Either fix the #ACA or give us #MedicareForAll. 

RM: @MartinHeinrich: Republicans' latest health care scheme threatens to throw our entire health care system into chaos. 
Hoping Senator McCain has a speedy recovery as he enjoys the high quality healthcare the GOP would deny the rest of us.
Perfectly said!!!
vote NO!
You mean so you can take people's healthcare away?
Saw @JohnCornyn on MTP this morning. John is sounding old and senile. I doubt he makes it to 2020.
He'll be fine, has great health insurance.

Protect your future! Medicare will be next on the chopping block!
#SaveACA
#VoteNoBRCA…
All Americans want access to healthcare as you and Mr. MCCain.
You need a good health care bill.  I vote in TX
I feel for John McCain, has so much stress on him defending our Country over Russia. Maybe you need to look at that Cornyn. Put Country1st
@JWGOP You blocked John Weaver so he couldn't see stuff like this? And you claim liberals hate free speech. You're not a serious person
Wishing McCain well after he had taxpayer funded surgery so you can vote to strip millions of their healthcare is beyond ironic. #2020Adios

DIRECTIVE 

Action Call…

The amazing Pamela Westerman of talking to a reporter from Fayetteville 40/29 news in front of @SenTomCotton office! #protectourcare 

Hi @SenToomey

#Trumpcare is class war
By the rich against the poor

…

 

.@SenDeanHeller This woman with Stage 4 cancer is begging you to do the right thing. Be a hero and stop #Trumpcare https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/886073611231965184 …
so you can destroy health care in America? such a great get well gesture!
Would the Mayo Clinic he had his surgery at accept Trumpcare?
McCain sucks! He's a liberal Trumo bashing rino that leaks to the liberal media. He needs to retire!
Americans need @GOP to stop propagating their own self interests and focus on what's best for all of US Not just the top 1%. #ProtectOurCare
Total embarrassment to the Great State of Texas. We'll vote you out soon.
I'm running around in circles 
Still I can't understand 
But w/ my 3rd eye open
I can see:
That you treat me like a fool
Your "alternatives" stink. The failure is all yours and when people start dying we can all blame you and your cronies
I bet McCain is happy he has health insurance right now. Don't threaten everyone else's. #MedicareForAll
U want him well so he can help u screw over millions of Americans? Nice sentiment u heartless bastar*!
SHAMELESS. You only want him so you can get a vote on a healthcare bill hated and UNWANTED  BY MILLIONS OF AMERICANS!
Right, get well wishes for republicans and the wealthy. Otherwise, all other Americans die as soon as possible, including children and vets.
Put up. Or shut up. That's my life's motto. #SaveACA 
#VoteNoBCRA
You couldn't just wish him well, could you. Had to make this about you. Sheesh!
IF BCRA is so fab, why aren't you holding rallies in support? If it's good, people will come to support. Invite @POTUS--he lives for rallies
81 y.o. Vet has emergency surgery; puts hold on Senate vote to take away health insurance from other 81 y.o. men, their grand kids, Veterans
Happy for McCain to have healthcare. Do not take it away from millions of Americans.  From Texans.
.@SenatorCollins to @ThisWeekABC: GOP health care bill "would make sweeping and deep cuts in the Medicaid program." http://abcn.ws/2tfyJkR  
@SenJohnMcCain If you all are going to kill ACA, then just allow me to deduct medical 100 percent from my taxes.
Blah! Ppl were hurt with Ocare, but millions were helped. Fix what hurt ppl and stop blaming Dems for your partisanship.

Blocked by my own Sen @JohnCornyn Guess he's not too proud of his constant fake news on health care, etc. #SamHoustonwouldnotbeimpressed
Your constituents need health insurance.  Don't you care about them?
Good thing you have insurance!
Have you seen your approval rating this morning John?  28% of Texans approve of you John!  That is lower than Ted Cruz.  LOL!!
Yeah we need him to retire
Get better @SenJohnMcCain and get well soon and then go ahead and retire. Bring it on home sir
Yes. Enjoy the tax funded healthcare before you take it away from the rest of the country
Do U get overwhelming #hypocrisy of #McCain getting surgery with #TaxpayerFunded #Healthcare delaying a vote to take HC away from millions?
I'm sure it would be easy for McCain to vote yes while recovering.

Collins: "These changes would be made without the Senate having held a single hearing to evaluate their impact." 
It's funny that you don't see the irony of this tweet.
Hi Texas tell Cornyn that a healthcare plan he designs with your interests @ heart MUST be his plan too. After all, he is pushing it on you!
Make him declare that he will also use this healthcare plan & get him on record!!
