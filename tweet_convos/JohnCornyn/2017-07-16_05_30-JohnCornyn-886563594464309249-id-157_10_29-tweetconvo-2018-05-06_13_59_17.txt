Will not watch fake news MSM; @cnn. Suggest all @GOP stop giving MSM an audience. WeThePpl know the liberal spin. Support @realDonaldTrump
1- Healthcare, single-payer / 2 - Russia, Impeach & Prosecute / 3 - @GOP marches across the USA stopping at every house to beg forgiveness
It would be nice if you could discuss either issue without lies, misstatements and spin.
"Access" is meaningless. I have ACCESS to a Maserati dealership. You're going down with Trump.
How can you say Dems refuse to help when you locked them out day one in Senate? Sen. McCaskill begged Sen. Hatch to even SEE the bill.
Your loosing the battle of lies,running yo head about a great man ,@BarackObama didn't see one @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence sign in Texas.
Where I was raised you could get a ass whipping , parents or teacher for lying and talking shit about a good man @BarackObama is a great one
And you say?

you are an alternate WOW fact buffoon. Twisting a 100% partisan carve out to REDNECK States, health bill - your title FOOBAR man
Just quit, Senator. You're embarrassing Texas.
Sam Houston would beat the sh*t out of @JohnCornyn.

Disgusting traitor.
Sen. Hatch had to ask an aide if there would be a hearing and told Sen. McCaskill "NO". Dems are begging to fix the ACA in a bipartisan way.
Saw it.  Pure Cornyn "yes man" and "Jump?  How high?"   We need Senate leadership, not followship.
I just wonder how long Texas voters can stand this bull S#!t?
The GOP has the hands on the wheel and are driving your current health care into a ditch and trying to blame Obama - http://read.bi/2tiBSLL 
Here is that video of their exchange!

Just watched it. Dismal, John. So much doublespeak and lying in 7 minutes. You clearly have no respect for the people you represent.
Have fun! Try to throw a little fact-based truth in there to mix it up a bit. Maybe a little spine to stand for American sovereignty, too.
you know good and well they cannot add truth
Trumpcare is DEAD - kudos to the Resistance! Start over. (But you had 7 yrs .. just saying) SINGLE. PAYER.
DANGER,DANGER,WILL ROBINSON!!
How many meetings have you had with the Democrats to fix Obamacare? It sounds like you came up with a plan without asking them. Loser

If Texas had accepted the Medicaid Expansion 600,000 people wouldn't need access to Healthcare, they'd already have had it years ago.
Shame on you.  History will not be kind to those in power who turn their back to those in need #VoteNo
About that^: "Dem's have not lifted a finger" ? Shame on Sen. Cornyn.
Oh wait, I thought you deemed him part of the "fake news" contingent. I guess he's not "fake news" when you want to use him? @MeetThePress
Senator, I don't believe a word you said on his segment.
After seeing you on Meet the Press,I get why you are perfectly aligned with an incompetent,corrupt thug Russian puppet,who stole White House
This is a question I'm very eager to know YOUR answer to:
Why isn’t every GOP intel & foreign affairs committee chair House & Senate demanding removal of proven security risks from White House?
I hear you are blocking your own constituents from seeing your public statements on twitter. Is this true?

2. The Administration claims that Medicaid is "not being cut."

Here's what governors were shown. 
Deflect and divert. Stick to the script Johnny.
You keep saying there's no approved bill yet, but all versions so far gut protections for pre-existing conditions. What's your fix?
How can you say the dems are doing nothing when Mitch himself said he ABSOLUTELY  would not work with them.
Try not to be an embarrassment to your constituents, please.
Remember when being a "commie" was a bad thing?
Cry Me a River!. Insurance companies are Raking in the Profits in the Billions!
False narrative on working with the democrats on health care. Schumer offered to work with GOP but you restricted it to 12 white men.
Quit pissing on us & telling us it's raining.
You're such disappointment. Poor Texans will have crappy TrumpCare insurance, seniors and disabled thrown out of Nursing homes.
ACA is not a failure. #trumpcare sux.  Quit the lies.
At which time you will side with horrible healthcare and Putin.

I will get prepared to hear your lies
Please don't say insurance companies r losing money, profits maybe less,but they DO NOT lose money  rates & provide less. Don't insult us
reform really? by killing MEDICAID, harming infants, seniors, disabled FIX FIX
DO YOUR JOB
Wasting your time with this Trump Agenda hating POS. Record interview and see how much lying Chuckie cuts out to make  Trump look bad.
You cut Democrats out of the process and then accuse them of not being willing to work on the bill? Pretty dishonest talking point.
Y'all wont let Democrats discuss their ideas about healthcare, stop playing the blame game and be roll models.
Just watched. Same evasive bs answers by never answering the questions on healthcare.  Nothing but rhetoric and double talk.
Are you listening? 50% of the people want you to know what you are doing before you change Obama care!!!
TV screen says you are back in Texas. When can we plan on you scheduling a townhall? The people of TX would LOVE to speak with you!

Why. Waste of time.
@MeetThePress Sir, how dare you say Dem are lifting a finger. 13 Sen drew up this bill wiping out Medicaid and removing IRS taxes for Trump.
Why do you not care about Americans? Please stop lying. This is just a tax cut for rich. You don't want Dems input? STOP lying.
You can't sell me your junk healthcare bill, your plan will increase my rates much more than ACA did. Bringing back junk insurance, thanks
.@chucktodd Killing ppl is not rescuing them. Yes, there is a better way: Medicare for all. Conscienceless reps need to & will be voted out.
Why is it you never acknowledge the millions of people (like me) who have been helped by Obamacare?
Oooooh! How exciting for you to be Trump's apologist.
Tax cuts for the rich, increase of healthcare costs for the poor, and no accountability for @POTUS
Dems not doing anything on Healthcare?U Reps sat on your hands for 8+yrs. You LIE!!   U just want to fill your pockets w/our Money.  Thiefs
Senator, what about the fake news crisis?  Should we believe anything that you discuss on the show as real?
@realDonaldTrump 
@MeetThePress
Looking forward to hearing your lies
No more softballs from pags.
keep whipping gop hcare..

The uncertainty is the rank & file know their amendments will be stripped during reconciliation
Your promise was to repeal Obamacare
And you'll lie as usual...because that's what you do.
Listen to your constituents. #NOREPEAL
Please explain why ur pushing a bill so cruel, so unnecessary & so unpopular it'll flip the House in 2018 but ur pushing it anyway. WHY?
The @SenateGOP #BCRA bill exempts @JohnCornyn and puts a $6,000 deductible on a person making $12,000
Tax cuts and treason!
Repeal "ACA" !
Explain to the American people why you have exempted yourselves from your healthcare bill.
Talk about an exercise in futility.
Popping popcorn now in anticipation of your crazy showing. You truly live in an alternate reality.
good to know you will be lying again
Are you going to explain why senate, congress and Supreme Court are exempt?
this will help you prepare your talking points!
I don't watch or listen to anything pussyface todd has to say. He's nothing short of a fake wannabe journalists who acts as a henchmen
Bot
Please tell us why #BCRA eliminates presumptive eligibility filed by hospitals filing and retroactivity of medicaid. #HandsOff #savetheACA
Truth. We demand it.
Ignorance and incompetence of the law is not a defense for Jr or Jared. Revoke Jared's clearance. #DoNothingGOP
What lives and half-truths will you speak?
Will you be talking about the fact that Trump’s presidential campaign has been caught colluding with Russia?
Watch out for the pitchfork.
#Texas doesn't want your disastrous #Healthcare, er, tax break for 1% bill! #VoteNo or #VoteOutCornyn #Vote2020 #TimeToRetire
Hopefully you can tell the truth @JohnCornyn and not be so damned #Complicit?
Try stating fact the election wasn't hacked the corrupt colluding cheating D.N.C, podesta and clinton opreatives were
So u can lie about it? No thanks
Remember: you are supposed to be working for US, not Russia. I know it's been confusing for you lately.
You'll have to seriously contort yourself if you plan to defend this administration. Lies and collusion everywhere. Tax cuts for the 1%!
A reputable media outlet. Good for you.
Tell chuck you are sending my mom in S. Texas to an early grave with GOP version of healthcare bill. Gutting Medicaid is a sad thing to do.
Save your breath. "We need to kick 22 million off insurance and OMG, her emails!". There, did it for you, John. You're welcome.

Just combine the two & talk about the undue influence of $ in politics. & your personal experience.
By granting stamp of acceptability, you make a Devil's pact with the White House. You become spiritually complicit. Your soul has been sold.
And continue spewing all of ur lies? No thanks.....

32 #cancer orgs, representing pts & providers, ask Senate to vote NO on #BCRA. Add your voice, call Senators. (844) 257-6227 #ProtectOurCare 
This should be entertaining

Fixing healthcare takes putting us, we the people, before your party! Either fix the #ACA or give us #MedicareForAll. 

"I'm begging, Senator Heller" - This woman is battling stage 4 cancer and Trumpcare at the same time 

Families in Texas will be worse off under #Trumpcare. Health insurers could cut benefits and weaken protections. #ProtectOurCare 
Chuck please ask him tough questions

Senate health care bill wouldn't fix opioid epidemic, experts say http://on.msnbc.com/2uqceJc  
The Senate doesn't really care about "fixing" the epidemic...they just want to pretend they care by throwing $$$ at it.
They are NOT throwing money at anything apart from their pockets.
@chucktodd is fake news

JUST IN: Insurance industry says Cruz amendment will unleash a death spiral for people with pre-existing conditions. 
Kushner's security clearance must be revoked!
be sure to let them know how they can appropriately address u: as Captain Hypocrite.
