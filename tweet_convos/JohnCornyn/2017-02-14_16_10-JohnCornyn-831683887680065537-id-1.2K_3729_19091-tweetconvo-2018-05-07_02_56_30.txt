How is he the best man for the job?  He had served no military experience
just like admiral bonespur @POTUS
what was Obama's military experience? Clinton's?
dodging a draft is different than choosing not 2 serve.  It's indefensible no matter who does it (gw bush, Clinton, trump)
He didn't dodge anything.  Got a college deferral like Every other college student.  Them THE ARMY DOCTOR noticed the bone spurs.
1-y med defer for bone spurs is draft dodging. 5 defers is draft dodging. my dad didn't take a college deferral, he served.
Was your  dad in college at the time?
Take t when ppl dedend draft dodgers from either side of the aisle. Just as despicable when bill Clinton did it.
This is 1 reason why Senators don't have kids fighting in our #Military for regime change against #Russianfakeaggression
As a matter of fact I don't think 1 Senators kids are even in the #ArmedServices fighting their bogus Wars!
lots of senators have kids in military serving
who?
Crickets.
you are correct if you are talking about the democrates
Tim Kaine is a dem & his son is in the military
So far up to 2 out of 100, sure there are a couple others but by no means "lots"
What Did Trump sacrifice for Trump?
Great! Letâ€™s raise those taxes on wealthy people  and treat our vets properly!
Yes Trump & Repubs will raise taxes on themselves & wealthy friends and backers.
I was being a little facetious.
that's a very pretty purple egg you've got there
You like that? I'm not so vain I need to post photos
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs thank you VP Pence! Keep up the great work!
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs Thank you for trying to fix the VA.  The Vets deserve better.  The last 8yrs have been an embarrassment.
it's been an embarrassment since Vietnam.
Waitin 5 years for phys therapy as a cat 1, yay gov't healthcare!

Shulkin better fix it!

So you're expanding benefits for veterans? Great news for them, I'm sure!
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs Trump you are a loser, three broken arms agreements since you have been in, get tough Iran, Korea now Russia
you suck
Please call for investigation of Flynn & Trump's income taxes to protect our freedom.
And let's investigate Hillary.
the FBI already did... Twice
Check today's news. We need those income tax returns. Congress, hurry!!!
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs  #Russia #Russia #Russia #Russia #Russia #Russia #Russia #Russia #Russia #Russia #Russia #Russia #Russia #Russia
and, by taking care of our military, does that include when your admin cut childcare for military??? Effective 2/28
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs I'm glad you're VP.  Pres Trump needs people he can trust.  Be cautious with Obama miles in Admn. Clean house!
The media&politcal opponents insult the citizens with assumption&lies trying make true by repetition
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs VA workers in general need a complete ATTITUDE change. Selfish Slackers that rnt good and don't care. HELP! THANX
I agree 100%. It's about time we recognize our Military for their Honorable sacrifice to protect &serve @POTUS @DeptVetAffairs
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs Except for their kids...
Save our military from the Anthrax Vaccine! https://youtu.be/5sKvmL9YR2w 

Could not hope for a better #VP. God bless you, our veterans, and the USA! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Trump lied to Veterans,insulted POWs,Gold Star Families,Generals,US Intelligence Community,& our military. #Unfit
Why is Jon McCain's veterans hospitals the worst in the nation? He needs to do his job. What's his connection to Soros?
Senator McCain is a patriot. He wants what trustworthy Americans want..the TRUTH.
McCain is not a republican..He is a RINO and needs to be replaced with somebody that can make intelligent decisions..
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs U realize U need to finance good care for our vets, right?
"All these protests against Trump are not spontaneous, manufactured by @OFA and OFA is Obama."
So many vets against yr admin bc they recognize they sacrificed to protect Constit & u all subvert it! Go @votevets!
So many vets were against Obama. Should he have changed course based on that?
Nope, but @realDonaldTrump assumes he has most vets in his corner.
@Theresa_Cali @DeptVetAffairs maybe ill get the surgery I've been waiting for almost 3 years for
i pray that you do! My daddy has had the same problems. Disgraceful
Thank you! Thanks to your dad for serving.
thank you!
people like you make it an honor
just wish the world could get it's priorities staight. They forget the sacrifice so quickly
I am beginning to think this is by design.
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs hopefully we can see a better outcome than the previous leaders.  I know of Dr. Shulkin, God's speed ahead.
3 John 1:2
Dear friend, I pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well with you, even as your soul [1/2]
I'm afraid that you're praying for the wrong thing. #ImpeachTrump #FireThemAll #2018isComing
@daniel345273 @DeptVetAffairs Keep our minds on missing & Indiana Killer
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs MISINFORMATION management of assumptions &lies in the part of the media are creating dangerous divisions&chaos.

lol you were played like a stooge dude. ur buddies not telling u important info for 15 whole days?? wow

Follow the money.
The VA only wants us disabled vets to die off, soon.
Not going to hold my breath till he does.
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs Show respect for these and quit wasting our money for your damned luxury. You're a government employee now.
So important that no veteran should ever be homeless or wanting for anything.We owe them so much.
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs Yes Sir To that,100% and then some!!!
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs Will U Fulfill UR Promise 2 This VERY FORGOTTEN LEFT 2 DIE
BY MY OWN COUNTRY I was in Germany I was Treated WELL
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs @realDonaldTrump please look into @WtrGpsy claim of torture malpractice and severe negligence I'M SEEKING JUSTICE
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs I'll bet Putin is quaking in his boots over your tough words!
hope so ,BUT,the @POTUS and WH have terrible credibility problems that comes with daily lies from @realDonaldTrump
IF YOUR admin wants to #maga then give US Contractors Military Status for Benefits when it comes to employment
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs How exactly?  This administration needs to give its citizens actual factual statements that have merit.
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs grateful to see veterans being thought of!
I shall speak on behalf of those I mentor and served with. Bullshit.
@WERStanford @DeptVetAffairs Congrats! VP Pence, keep Up the good work & God Bless!
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs wt abt the widows of #vets who hv bn forgotten? My dad served in #Vietnam & my mom has been forgotten by the #VA.
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs Americans will be watching!
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs The world would be in a lot better place if Trump could be dumped and Pense took over
I hope you truly make this happen!
@KazmierskiR @DeptVetAffairs is going to fire the AZ VA hospital director? She needs to go. Totally incompetent.
@GasOperated300 @DeptVetAffairs God Bless Our Vets. It's Time Their Needs Come First
we will hold him to that.
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs I took oxychloride now I am deathlike!!!
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs See how easy this EXPERIENCED candidate passed. Could ya keep that in mind on the go forward. ~ America
turn the place upside down vets on top and CEO on the bottom. Ask the employees how to do job better.
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs How does it feel to be shut out by the Pres. Left in the dark for weeks. I'm sure your bond is stronger now
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs Sacrificed for our freedom, everyone but Trump he had an heel spur and could not go. I think it hurt , he CRIED.
Seems everyone promises change, but no one does. We vets don't count.
Haven't seen any changes yet???
Use the 25th Amendment to protect and care for our veterans, and the American people.
As a US ArmyDisabled Veteran & DVA Police Officer I reported corruption at VA as a result my career was destroyed.
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs I HOPE HE CLEANS HOUSE AND GETS RID OF THE PPL THAT LET OUR VETERANS DOWN FROM THE TOP DOWN. CHANGE RULES TO FIRE
@POTUS then why the freeze that doesn't allow the VA to hire much needed doctors, nurses, mental health workers, etc? Making waits long!
I think personly _ou doing a great job but wonder a bout res/ of the white house voter for62 yrs
As someone who has/had many members in service of our country.  Thank you
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs Idiot.
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs What about Those in Gov who tell lies about relationship with Russia?? Your allied wonder!!
This pick seems to be solid. Bet he doesn't "love" draft dodgers, Donald.

@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs  support the veterans.  Ditch tRUMP
Really. I've a friend who's father is a veteran and dying with no care. Let's see you get on that.

Thank you.
- Yes! Thank you, POTUS Trump. Our military are also ambassadors for the nation, God bless them.
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs from the British or the Native tribes?
The Phoenix VA Hospital has only gotten worse since the Scandal the employees are very abusive to Veterans
I doubt that David Shulkin will take care of Veterans with the shoddy way he has run Veterans Choice Program
I aslo have the oldest open claim for disabality , it dated 5 july 69???
The VAMC Clevelaand, Ohio still hasn't paid medical bills on me and I ahve credit collectors on my back>
When is he going to put in the complaint line you promised in your campaign?
. LOVE !
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs Fight back, reinstate Flinn.. go after those traitors, we need flint with us Sir
No more homeless VETS. Wise Choice !!
hope the GOP lives up to the promises it made over the past generation about caring for our veterans.
Release your tax returns. What are you hiding?
.@VP @DeptVetAffairs nice words. Let's see some action.
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs Hey Pence..What did YOU know & when did you know it? VP is also a LIAR. Must be a prerequisite for Trump admin.
God Bless him as he works to care for our veterans in a decent and honorable way. We owe our veterans so much!
Is he going to take care of all those who will suffer from an admin that colludes with America's enemy to get elected??
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs oh us this for the Jewish, black, female and gay veterans too?
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs I pray that he does. 
Lets hope. It worries me that" all the dimwits" voted for him!! If you're a dimwit, I have my doubts!!!!
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs very white an no women
@POTUS mr pence how much crazy are you going to tolerate and even support from the WH? Trump lies to you just like he lies to us.
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs what about the people in banned countries who helped US forces overseas? Who's caring for them?
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs Start in New Orleans. So many veterans with out homes. Couldn't even get breakfast with out felling like shit.
@POTUS @DeptVetAffairs I hope so, I've been waiting for my claim 17 years.  Enough!

Was it okay that Trump and Flynn threw you under the bus and sent you out to lie on the TV talk shows? So embarrassing for you.
Does that mean the "free" healthcare for life I was promised when I enlisted in the '80s will become free again?
