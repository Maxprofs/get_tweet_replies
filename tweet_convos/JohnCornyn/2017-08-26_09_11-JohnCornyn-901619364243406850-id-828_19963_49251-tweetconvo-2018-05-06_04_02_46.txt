@CarlyDooley
@realDonaldTrump will revel in the fact @BarackObama never organised anything like that after Katrina...
Because he wasn't president then
Are you sure? Where have I been all thee years...?
In Steve Bannon's Acid Hot Tub Time Machine?
Hi - I work for NBC 5 in DFW. May we have permission to use your photo on all NBC platforms please?
Yes, you have permission to use the photo I took
thank you! Do you have any info about the dog or what happened to him?
His name is Otis and he was traveling back to his house with the full unopened bag of dog food when I spotted him down the street.
did he get home safely?
Yes! He just got out and apparently came home with an unopened bag of dogfood!
That's one prepared pooch 
Isn't that looting.  Bad dog! 
Smart dog. Packs a lunch. 
Glad u sit the record straight.  We are quick to judge even a poor dog who was trying to get home with his OWN bag of dog food.
Pup-praring for being in a shelter
Smart dog!
Hopefully they didn't give him the boot!
I love  this picture!!
Me too Cindy...sad though
@itsLABOYmaria
"I am prepared"
He was!
A Forward Thinker.
@Brianibarra3237 cry
He's stocking up for the apocalypse ya have to be ready
we treat animals like they are dumb when they are not.

#ProudVegan
He's going to feed his displaced friends!
@ericvazquez99 if this was B I'd cry my eyes out
Wow! So glad owner found him.
Me on my way to Texas to save all the dogs from hurricane Harvey
Smart dog.
WOW!!
@weRtroydavis
Looters will be shot.
god I love this
Otis was just taking food to all the dogs that were left with out a home, after the flood hit.
That is a great photo. Can WFAA and it’s partners use it on air and online?
Yes, you can use the photo I took
@dog_rates Check it out.
But was it looted? #DogsCanLootToo #Harvey #ArrestHim #NoExceptions
This made me laugh harder than anything in the last week. Ty!! 
Great to hear! 
someone give him a home please.
Read through the comments. His name is Otis, he was out on walkabout. He's back home where he belongs
Awesome.  Ty
He was headed to the Butter Churn hoping they made that pecan cobbler a day early.
Pecan cobbler??? We don't have that in California. In fact, we don't have much cobbler at all in California. 
It's the real deal...only made on Sunday.
Butter Churn I've heard is fantastic
I've never heard of it but it has to be good by virtue of its name.

That dog can come to my house any time. Well prepared puppy...lol
Looting
Adopt him for our farm id say @JordanBrg1
@candaceleigh06 
Phewww..
That dog like "hunger is for the birds"
@ChristianG7777
He saw everyone else carrying stuff....  ;)
#HaveFoodWillTravel Glad to hear he's safe and sound.
This dog has done more for Texas than any celebrity has.
@maritzah027
@ashleysurette broke my heart
Breaks my heart that some dogs are probably lost wondering where there family is
:((((((((((
Awww!!! That's so sad!!
God Bless this refugee ..may he be warm dry w a full belly tonight
@nancyIicona loook
@Mikayy_Rashae @megan_clawson_

Thanks for sharing Otis' pic and happy to know he's not a #RefugeeDog! Thoughts and prayers with TX!
That dog doesn't mind a sack lunch!
Omg I wanna pet him & give him more food 
I hope he's safe♡♡♡
@ohsnapits_greta
Bring him to Gayle Street, he's mine now
Aw...poor baby.
10/10 would recommend good doggo
Did he get home, is he safe?
I hope somebody helped him instead of just taking a fucking picture
I hope there are groups rescuing the animals. They are also in distress.
I even think you might my 4 legs

.
Smart dog...
My heart almost broke
He's living his life man
#priorities

Sad but he look like he's prepared
I can't blame Otis I would be getting the hell out of there to trying to find Higher Ground 
Score.  Somebody is happy with the flood.
LOOOOTER!!!!! Haha jk
@alomejorandrea  I CANT
Poor thing 
He probably would start crying
"I ain't dying in no god*** flood I'm out"
this dog is living in 2030
INSTEAD OF TAKING PICTURES YALL GOTTA START HELPING THEM
I hope @FoxNews will not say, "Dogs start looting Texas" like what they falsely accused those blacks who were trying to escape Katrina.
Smart dog
Thats it, this hurricane got to go
Looters are starting to run rampant it parts of Texas ! LMAO! Where's the dog catcher to stop this lawlessness? At least it wasn't a TV!
Awwww bless him xxxx
According to Fox News he's a looter
Dog is more self sufficient than most liberals.
@EmyKoller @ruddockr  smart pup

Laura, I've been thinking about this #dog all day. I #pray it, and others made it through to high ground.

Smart dog, smarter than most humans.
Glad he's ok! Smart Otis! - Otis for President!!!! 
Please rescue this dog. PLEASE!!

Smart dog, 
This doesn't get old, such a resourceful fella!
So sad
he seems to be smarter than some people- taking his food and getting out, rather than staying.
He smart.  RT @SoulSistaNokc: RT @LHuffmanPowell:
