Here's a review of who gets Medicaid in Texas. It's kids, people w/disabilities, low-income elderly & pregnant women. 
Prove it.
That 13 year waitlist for Medicaid services will get longer. Less people will get fewer services and more fragile people will die.
Did you hear Elizabeth Warren's impassioned speech regarding healthcare
That $2.3 billion is so you can pay for tax cuts. Y'all keep forgetting to say that. Kids, disabled folks lose care for tax cuts. #txlege
Does @JohnCornyn run his own Twitter, or are taxpayers footing the bill for someone else to churn out all his lies?
A staffer told us he does his own tweets.
Bless his heart.
This is a flat-out, pants-on-fire, 4 Pinnochios, lie.

If you cut $77B/yr on average from Medicaid funding over he next decade, millions WILL lose coverage, period. There's no way around that. https://twitter.com/bijans/status/883639870484344832 …
#BCRAP will change Medicaid for TX forever- 1.89mill lose medicaid(46% total enrolled; min. 1/3 enrolled # kids if all adults lost coverage)
The Republican Party, led by you want to bring back Jim Crow, segregation, lynching, this bill is a big step towards That!
How do u know? According to u it isn't written yet? So quit telling people crap!
Lying again. Have the courage to meet with us in person. We're ready anytime. Just have your scheduler get in touch.
Liar!  Your healthcare bill will hurt your constituents. How do you call yourself a Christian?  I think you have sold your soul to the devil
You are tweeting a lot about a bill that doesn't exist yet. I'm thinking the reports r right and y'all are ramping up to push thru. Don't.
Senate GOP & WH plan final, urgent blitz to pass health-care law - The Washington Post
Isn't this the bill that you are still #workingonit ?
https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/07/07/us/politics/republicans-health-care-bill.html …
you are a slithery, lying sack of you know what, buddy. and you have the stones to lie like this in public, on record? shame.
@JohnCornyn is the #worstsenatorinusa
I thought the Senate didn't have a bill yet. Are you trying to confuse us or just making stuff up?

Senate GOP & WH plan final, urgent blitz to pass health-care law - The Washington Post
But I thought... how could you know this if it's true... keep your story straight John.
They'll just get less of it.
your credibility senator is not what it used to be, you would say anything today to get this criminal bill passed
How much from the kochs, evangelicals, hobby lobby, wynn to ram this piece of crap down our throats? Enough of the Republican Confederacy.
You think 6000K deductibles is a choice. You think it's "access" you bought and paid for fraud. You lying sack. You Republican "christian"
Per capita caps roll back far more than just ACA expansion...
Meaning they will still be eligible, but will receive much less? Texas has high uninsured and maternal mortality rates.
An estimated  2.4 million Texans will lose insurance. An estimated 26,000 Texans will lose jobs. What is in your heart?
FALSE
A cut is a cut, and it's a cut to our most vulnerable citizens to benefit our most well-off citizens
How do you sleep at night? Ambien?
There is a crazy person in the White House.
In Cornyn, Cruz, & Abbott's Texas...Medicaid, now capped (for some/all?). BO/Perrry, no cap. GWB/Perry, cap. Fd Stamps, some/most new=$16 mo
Making Medicaid a block grant will reduce what funds states get and how they're distributed. You know this
Stop the lying and give us what you promised #FullRepeal of Obamacare just like the GOP promised the last 7 years. 
Show me where it says that we will have enough $ to add participants and cover everyone already enrolled.
will you offer an amendment to BCRA to hold children and people with disabilities harmless from the bill's funding cuts?
We didn't expand Medicaid. However, it will cap what we spend. Less people will be covered or less services.
So you admit it's already achieving the goal but still call for reform? It's ok, just repeat after me: "I'm wrong and I'm sorry and I quit."
@indivisibleATX @CPPP_TX @CDFTexas @covertexasnow Liar. Maybe right now. But later???
There would, however, be a lot less to serve the needs of these people if the disaster if a plan you keep pushing actually gets passed.
How stupid do you think we are? The CBO begs to differ. And this before the amendment that would allow states to permanently quit Medicaid.
Want to make TX blue again?  Go ahead and pass it!  AM radio Texans must experience GOP policy 1st hand to separate reality from rhetoric.
you really do have no shame
Have you always been a liar or only since you went into politics?
Except it'll cap payments without actually lowering healthcare costs. There will be less money to go around, so people will have to be cut.
The people of Texas are not going to forget how hard you pushed & lied about the BCRA when you run for re-election. Get a better plan, John.
Prove that statement. By my reading of BCRA, many will lose coverage. You seem to be saying it is so, because I say so  which is ridiculous
A Timeline: Russia and President Trump http://bit.ly/2tyiPBq   via @BillMoyersHQ
2/2 Obamacare expanded Medicaid in the states with decent governors. Those are the states you'll really hurt when you make these huge cuts.
1/2 The states w/ GOP governors that crapped out on Medicaid expansion will be hurt less, by percentage, because they had less to lose.
@indivisibleATX @CPPP_TX @CDFTexas @covertexasnow Medicaid will be reduced over time hurting those very groups @indivisibletxjc
Liar lying
Please do explain how. Funding cuts mean fewer folks covered or less coverage for those folks.
Have an online townhall.Go through some real scenarios that are posted by real people not the ones you hand pick for horror stories.Prove it
Instead you just keep saying "trust me" when the only thing everyone agrees on Rs and Ds is that the rich are getting a tax break.
On paper but we have a couple of haters in the Tx govt right now that will work to deny these funds.  Amazing the lies that come out of you
We don't want BCRA
@indivisibleATX @CPPP_TX @CDFTexas @covertexasnow people are NOT buying this lie! BCRA Has 12% approval rate & you have 28%!
@indivisibleATX @CPPP_TX @CDFTexas @covertexasnow that is a LIE and you know it!
Here's the thing, John. Your own caucus is abandoning this bill like a sinking ship. Planning to be the last rat on board?
Ok, liar. Explain how exactly that is going to work. Or not, since you're a liar.
Stop the lies John...
BCRA projected to blow $2.3 BN hole in TX budget in 2022. That's a pretty big change for 4.5 million Texans. @covertexasnow #txlege
If you can't be honest about it, why support it? If you support it, why hide what it is?
Hi John. Just one of your constituents here. Why do feel like you can lie to us? Do you think we're all just ignorant hillbillies?
Red hot lies!! Get your lies here!!!!
which just means that Texas politicians gutted Medicaid in Texas before BCRA.  So.... yay for you?
Please hold a town hall at a school for children with autism. Tell their parents that nothing will change. God forbid things get better.
town hall town hall town hall

NEW via @AARPpolicy: Impact of the #BCRA on total #Medicaid funding for AK, CO, NV, ND, OH & WV. See here: http://spr.ly/60188UaDK 

Over 1.4M people in #Louisiana are covered by #Medicaid, including 201,600 who also are covered by #Medicare
http://kaiserf.am/2sMTnDL  
Perhaps. Things that do change  - the level of funding they will get and the tax bill of your donors. Both go down significantly.

#Medicaid covers 6 in 10 #nursinghome residents. Learn more about Medicaid's role in nursing home care http://kaiserf.am/2tvJ09i 
More lies from #cowardcornyn and the #PartyOfLiars
except 2 million Texans will lose insurance. Oh nothing changes.
Except that pop. in Texas is dramatically increasing and funding will be stagnant.  Math says in the future, similar ppl wont be covered.

Really? Nothing?
So which the fuck is it john? Is medicaid good or bad. Make up your mind or stop lying
Now you're just lying. #ProtectOurCare #SaveACA
The CBO disagress with you. Who to believe? The partisan hack (you)? Or the nonpartisan congressional budget office?
@indivisibleATX Block grants will certainly cause States to begin cutting care. To deny that is to deny reality of state budgets

#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare #BCRA #AHCA #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
To be clear, Obamacare isn't failing. @realdonaldtrump is sabotaging it. 
Except that the FNBCRA will cut 800 billion from Medicare and GIVE it to a few persons. Liar.
Yes, the % of needy recipients may stay the same but the assistance they get will drop relative to the tax breaks of your contributors.
So quick ??: do you believe the lies you tell about this bill? Because if so I hear you have great insurance & you may want to use it.
Everything John has done in the Senate to enrich corporations and the wealthy has led to
You & rest of GOP need to stop trying to get Democrats to like you.  We elected YOU to execute a fiscally conservative agenda.
Also, if you don't get that damn wall up, the "forgotten" voters are not going to bother going to the polls in 2018.
Medicaid Must Be Reformed To Help Truly Needy & Claims of Spike in Uninsured
You are supposed to be representing Texans not trolling them on Twitter.  You disingenuous spin is disgusting.
LOL the same people will be covered, just a few Million less,, but Big Pharma and Insurance Co's will make bank so it's all good, right?
Are you sure we're all reading the same bill? Because I am pretty sure that's exactly what it says
Citation needed pls. "Scales back federal funding for Medicaid... That would leave states ... with fewer resources"
Hurting children and seniors really makes the GOP happy doesnt it
No, of course not; you're just going to DECREASE the amount of money allotted for each program. Oh... wait...
You say you're  going to give MORE money to the programs, but fail to mention the reason for the increase will be due to expenses NOT due
Up is down and down is up, right senator?

This is blatantly false.
Really? The CBO score is pretty terrible: 20+mil lose hc over a decade buys nice tax cut for your Koch bro friends. Explain this tweet.
There are no cuts to medicaid for the first 5 years by then we will have had 2 congresses that may add more funds(definitely if dem).
Yes this is how it stands Now. Let's see what new horrors they've added when the S is back in session.
You are complicit and we see right through your lies. #replacecornyn2020
hmmmmmm
There are no cuts to medicaid for the first 5 years by then we will have had 2 congresses that may add more funds(definitely if dem).
That's disingenuous Senator.  BRCA will drastically reduce the pool of money available to cover people who rely on Medicaid.
Are you really sticking to that false story? Give us some credit.

Capitol Police are arresting about 8 people outside Rubio's DC office. They keep chanting "Vote no Rubio" 

Protesters now outside of Republican Sen. Cory Gardner's Senate office. Chanting "shame on you." 

Blood on the floor outside of Leader Mcconnell's office as protestors are physically being removed. 
So we're just supposed to ignore all the professionals who've come out against the bill and take your word for it? No thanks
