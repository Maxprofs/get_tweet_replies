Good decision. I don't like Trump, but this is good for American jobs and energy, and relationship w/ Canada
This is NOT good news for America. Go read  up on Standing Rock and climate change. Please!!!
Also, solar is clean energy and provides more jobs than oil. Basic research, friend.
We can transition, and this in particular is about more than just the oil.
Or do you approve of the continual trampling of Native American rights?
I disagree with you on this, which is fine. I have my views you have yours. Lets not argue...
No sir. This is something that affects ALL of us. You're crazy if you think we'll stand down.
I will argue and I will protest and I will work to make sure this admin doesn't destroy what matters most.
Dismssng the Standing Rock Sioux Nation protests question was a mistake. There are sacred burial & water issues.
What about KeystoneXL?  It was previously approved by Congress & Senate before Obama vetoed it.
If Americans build the pipes then they're liable 4 environmental disasters should they break. No Canadian liability.
So you actually oppose ALL energy pipelines.  Why not be honest?  Your statement isn't true.  The owner operator is responsible.
Actually I don't. Your battle to be had is not with me. If American pipes break due to poor quality then we won't be liable.
A brand new pipeline made in America will be state of the art.  There is no pleasing those that oppose N.A. energy independence.
I don't oppose it but it makes it easier for people to lay blame at America's feet & not Canada's.
Okay.  Sure.
Oh!
do republicans know that he is going to destroy the environment ..

. Very supportive of the 1000 veterans who showed up to protest. Helping vets? Right?
you are Hitler!!!! We will fight to protect our Native American Brothers and sisters!!  land is sovereign nation
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Not sure this was a good idea. President should of talked to the American Indian to here their complaint
We must take care of the environment too.  We only have 1 country & it must help us survive.
Booooo
Those jobs are temp jobs only to build the pipeline!Then lay offs will follow!Then they can build your wall!!
Are you happy now @BernieSanders @DrJillStein VOTERS?!?!!!  SHAME ON YOU!
Fixed inaccuracies in your headline, @politico. #NoDAPL Dakota Pipelines #KeystoneXL. For you, @realDonaldTrump.
King Cyrus making the degenerate Babylonians mad. Hahaha
get on board the Trump Train snowflakes #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
saw a bunch of  doing this at the inauguration.
we"ll be out in force ,there will be blood , a private gig on public land ,ain"t gonna happen.
@JohnCornyn @realDonaldTrump did you ask Trump how much stock he had before signing guess ok with corruption
@JohnCornyn @realDonaldTrump again making more money for your oil comp. cronies while destroying our land! #NoDAPL #WaterIsLife
@JohnCornyn @realDonaldTrump - Don't be fooled - This oil will not stay in USA.  Has zero impact on US price of gas
@Trump_Supporter @realDonaldTrump His renegotiation is going to be stellar. ALL American made gives USA the chance to do it RIGHT!
. Rot Trump.
Money Money Money for business. I think Native Americans land and water is more important.
No originality, rebranding is the name of your game, infrastructure spending is Obama's idea an you rebranded!
another broken treaty to the American Indians
Pipelines are job killers. Lot more jobs driving oil-haul trucks.
..this evil moron can blast a school and his supporters will still justify him.
, kill the Earth, it's part of ISIS. #fakePresident
More coverage of DAPL with this single article than years under Obama.
.@politico please be accurate it's #KXL North, KXL South is already built in #Texas #Oklahoma & it was done by #Obama Executive Order!!!!!
Trump assaults our land. Its only the beginning.
When are we just going to accept the facts that he is concerned with big business, hates brown ppl, and cares nothing abt enviro.
Keystone was never about the environment.That oil has been transported in by Obama's "buddy"Warren Buffet's trains.They do crash & spill.
I think @justinbeiber asked the question recently. "Is it too late now to say sorry"? Yes it is America. Yes it is! U wanted this?
Next on deck:
Repeal sanctions on Russia so @exxonmobil can drill again.
Thanks! @TheDemocrats @DNC @DWStweets
Goodbye clean water! Goodbye environment!

BREAKING: US sent $221 million to Palestinians in Obama's last hours - AP

I'm not surprised at all that the POS did this .
Don, don't you have some $$ interest in the pipeline company? Can you say conflict of interest? Lawsuit
has an interest in these pipelines. Clear conflict of interest. Chaffetz @jasoninthehouse should be investigating
Proof?
And more.  Trump has done more to help the ordinary working American man/woman in 8 wks than Obama did in 8 yrs.
@MaureenFrench @realDonaldTrump Of course he did. He stands to profit from this. He couldn't care less about the American people.
I know, but we still need to get the info out. #NoDAPL #NoKXL #OurRevolution
@BretBaier @realDonaldTrump Let's get them built and tell the ragheads to screw off with their Muslim oil.
Hope you didn't except anything less.  It's all about the MONEY not the land and certainly not the people!
There will be backlash against this. Remember veterans coming to defend?
looks like the woman are going to the pipelines next
Trump can't be for all American's? His Alt-Right people will not stand for it. He's cornered and can't piss off.
Boooooo
@BretBaier @realDonaldTrump      Thank you President Trump for working so hard to make our country great again! GO USA 
A POTUS who works and puts Americans to work! #heismypresident #MAGA
Pro-Trump Dems & Independents in Rust Belt states are standing on their chairs and cheering.
Wounded Knee 2.0
make no mistake, while this is something they want, is a major smokescreen for gutting and killing the EPA.
booo!
Could you be any more one sided with your reporting? Real journalists report both sides.
that's funny, @GOP was angered when Obama used EOs for common sense reasons yet @realDonaldTrump uses them for personal gains
@BretBaier @realDonaldTrump  maybe we can get a pipeline from Moscow filled with the finest urine.
Excellent news #keystone #MAGA
I wish media in general would stop showing Trump signing anything.  It offers nothing interesting..
next up: Smallpox blankets for Indians.
what the incredible f**k!?
Alternative Fact check: The pipeline is good for the economy, and we don't care if it polluted water or goes thru sacred land af.
"pen and phone"
Watching him can't help noticing how bored he looks! 
so much for #NoDAPL!
@politico: @realDonaldTrump signs executive actions to advance the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines
No no no no no!!!   This is horrible!!!
Boooooooooooo 
Trump at work in the Oval Office.   Embrace the Suck, Politico.
big surprise. EVERYONE know he loves laying pipe.....
