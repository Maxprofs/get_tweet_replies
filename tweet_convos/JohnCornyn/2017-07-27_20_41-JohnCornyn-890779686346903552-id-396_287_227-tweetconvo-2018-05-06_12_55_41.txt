surprised? I'm not!
HERE YOU ARE COWARD!!!  YOU DON'T COME TO TOWN HALLS, YOU SHUT COMMENTS OFF ON FACE BOOK....SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE HIDING FROM TEXANS.  MAN UP
I dont get this he flip flops more than a fish out of water!!! Comeon Lindsay do the right thing from here on in!!!!
Love this move! Eels, snakes and jellyfish appreciate having an invertebrate to represent their needs in the White House!
It does not make sense to vote for a bill you do not support or agree with. #CA22
Why not the dems do it
Had a little weakening of the knees, Lindsey. Try to be more like your buddy, the Maverick McCain.
he got the message
Whatever is the matter with Lindsey? Not his best moment, no profile in courage there.
I said this earlier @LindseyGrahamSC talks like he's a maverick but then gets whipped into line by the GOP leadership. Sad\. #SkinnyRepeal
All talk, no action. Just likes the attention. @LindseyGrahamSC It's a shame what they are doing to our HC.
he does shit like this all the time,
I'll bet he wishes he voted no, now.
Thank God John McCain was our hero again
Lets say it together, like a dull knife just ain't cutting just talking loud and saying nothing.
True republican " for the party , hell with my So  Carolina people ?
Graham loves to play both sides of the fence. He can't be trusted to do what's right for the people.
Same ol same old ,a yapping fool!
#neverTrustArepublican
This is outrageous ! Only a couple of hours ago he called this bill a fraud. The disregard for the American people is extraordinary.
I thought he said that..,thanks for confirming
Graham, why did you believe in Ryan and McConnell and not you long friend John McCain! I will never believe in you again!
Work on the ACA!
Vote this spineless ass out of office
It is a fraud, but he voted yes. Enough said.
Fake Graham... time to replace him...
Graham is the buddy of McCain - traitor friend
At least his best friend had the guts to actually say no.
Shameful establishment elitists like drunk Gomer @LindseyGrahamSC are why Republican base shrinks. The greed and stupid continues...
@LindseyGrahamSC 
You lost my respect today. I can't believe you would vote for this undemocratic bill.
#shame
He never had mine.  But yeah, I think way less of him after that BS
Another partisan weakling.  How about the Americans who count on ObamaCare provisions - like no discrim 4 preexisting cond?
Talks out both sides of his mouth, he just said it was a bad bill but votes for it....SPINELESS
He got cover from McCain
This ass hat RINO needs to get the hell out of the party.
Focus groups can always reset your moral compass
Loooooooser
Because he's as slimy as the rest of them.
He is "joined at the hip" w/McCain. He voted yes because he is up for election in 2018, but Graham knew McCain's vote would STOP the bill.
In 2018 when Graham is up for re-election, voters need to remember that Graham joined forces with McCain to stop the bill.
Graham is a dumbass with no real regard for people.
His vote was never in doubt. He will always say he is against then vote the party line. We are on to him.
Coward!
Flip flop man

#partyoverpolicy
get rid of him and McCain
get lost Lindsey!!!
Wimp.
Big talk!
@LindseyGrahamSC  You knew JM was voting no so U could vote yes to save your ass & move forward w bill support to protect Mueller invest. 
All talk...but still a party boy...
Conviction turns tail and runs ... leave it to the women to have the "xxxxxx" to fight.
That's why you'll never be president.
He's letting McCain take the bullet in order to save his SC seat -since McCain near done- need Trey Gordy to run for Senate in SC!
So when it comes down to it, Graham didn't grow a conscience. Same ol' same ol'. Is there NO honor left in politics?
Lindsey caved again.
Just when I thought you had a backbone, you caved.
Graham proves once again that he speaks out of two sides of his mouth.He's a liar and a hypocrite while pretending to be honorable & ethical
Well, Johnny, no smiling faces from you, Teddy, or Mitch today-your sellout of millions failed
He could learn a thing or 2 from his buddy McCain
After he knew it would not pass. Coward!
Of course he will, it's  never what Graham says that's important,  it's what he does and we know his priority is party over country
Hypocrite Graham! Vote him OUT!
Expected more from Senator Graham. Disappointed that he was willing to play a dangerous game with our healthcare
i knew he would
Shame!
Mousy hypocrite coward.
Flip floppers go away
typical turncoat!
McCain did the right thing by voting no!
he Just likes dem teeVee shows he ons.. #pathetic #NotAPatriot
No backbone has joined the trump club
I'm on the left and I was hoping Graham would keep his word this time. Wrong! What a douchbag. Praising McCain tonight. And praying for him.
What happened Graham?..... lost your balls?
@LindseyGrahamSC He has always been a coward... he need a wife
Count on Graham to go Party over PPL. Every time. All talk no action. One of trump's bitches.
@LindseyGrahamSC God is watching you boy!
What lie did you tell him John.
You could join the side working on behalf of the American people to improve access to HC & lower costs? Or you could work on Ryan's plan...
Of course he will.
Single-Payer is inevitable.
Party over country. The Repub mantra
Weak.
@LindseyGrahamSC  heartless
@LindseyGrahamSC shame on you!  I thought you were a logical human?
Shame on @LindseyGrahamSC No heart.
Raise ur hand if ur surprised. Even just a little bit.
@LindseyGrahamSC such a gutless weasel. Party over People yet again
Do any of these republicans have a backbone. Do they all fold up in front of trump and his minions.Perhaps they are scared of Moochs mouth
Selling out Americans for nothing more than politics.
REALLY @LindseyGrahamSC ?  How about having the courage of your convictions? #SkinnyRepeal VOTE NO!
@JohnCornyn u dissing @LindseyGrahamSC's grandstanding? @SenateGOP u own this mess now #Shame on you all. U 2 @SenTedCruz @SenJohnMcCain
John McCain @SenateGOP sending sick folks to the grave TAXPAYERS pay THEIR insurance 100% #RiseUp #Sickos #cnn #msnbc #FoxNews Vote2018
@SenJohnMcCain you know in your gut @SenateMajLdr  @POTUS Trump @SenateGOP LYING to million of ppl for political gain #Sick #cnn #msnbc
NO NO NO!!!!!
17% approval for the skinny bill.  The Republican Party will dissolve with this bill.
Was there any doubt? Not I
In the end, @sengraham2016 , like his hero, @SenJohnMcCain, is just one more GOP hack; party before country is the GOP mantra #skinnyrepeal
Anyone voting for it is voting against the American people.   They are our REPRESENTATIVES, not our kings.
Lindsay Graham has no integrity his words are meaningless.
All mouth no action!
Most of the GOP is comprised of nothing but spineless POS that despite all their big talk still lockstep in place with party lines.
He and McCain are one and the same. Party over country.
So what changed @LindseyGrahamSC? What made u decide to vote this HORRIBLE DISASTER BILL? OH WELL, IT'S ON YOU BUT UR HC WILL B FINE, RIGHT?
They trust Paul Ryan or trust that the House won't pass the bill even if Ryan lies about conferencing. 

Bad bets I'm afraid....
@LindseyGrahamSC SHAME ON YOU!!!!!
You're a coward Lindsey!
Wow what a chicken shit'
Graham is a follower and not a leader, he knows its a bad bill but will vote for it anyway. Party over people. We got thrown under bus again
Shift accountability publicly, then vote the party line in the middle of the night. What a piece of Republican trash.
Just try to go  further in politics - you are losing this 2nd amendment supporter. Watch the base vanish #aca #acarepeal
Spineless.
Isn't that a pre-existing condition to becoming a GOP senator/representative?
Yes.  Winning is more important than constituents' welfare. I hope voters remember these dark days.
What'd you expect? @LindseyGrahamSC is famous for puffing out his chest, then falling in line when it counts. Your words mean nothing, sir.
@LindseyGraham Stop spouting off at the mouth and DO YOUR JOB, traitor.
Party of liars.
He is a loser. He just likes to say things too get publicity. At the end of the day he falls in line with the lemmings.
No, no, no. Don't do this to the people. Work together for something better. Skinny repeal my great aunt fanny. D@mnit! Where're your balls?
.@LindseyGrahamSC Shame on you!
Ah, a check must have finally cleared the bank
Sad
C'mon grow some #balls people are hurting due to a lack of support of Americans.Tired of the #corporate #bullshit We Are People not entities
So, they got to you huh? Keep in mind that when people have nothing, they will look at you and know what you and others have done to them.
Koch man!
Graham  always is... Graham!
another spineless, gutless man
Don't do it. Courage
@LindseyGrahamSC WHAT???
Treason corruption lies greed UnAmerican senator
You have no decency. You have no morality. You have no integrity. You don't serve anything but your own greed. That will be your legacy.
Coward. All talk!
So in the on going shell game, the holdouts will pass bill if house guarantees they won't vote on that bill, what a bunch of hocus pocus
@LindseyGrahamSC
Didn't take long to fold. No balls...no spine.  #TrumpcareSucks


So disappointing that you don't really care what happens to the American people.
WTF?
This guy is a Traitor he voted against us to hopefully get a sexual relationship with TRUMP or some one in the administration
Their words mean nothing-until they are used against them in the attack ads. 2018! 2020!
If that bill passes the GOP will own the huge fallout that will follow, had 7 years to do something and this is all they got? Pathetic
@LindseyGrahamSC is so easy and transparent in his motives to hurt America
@LindseyGrahamSC you must for NO for this bill. Any other vote is shameful.
How much was he paid
@LindseyGrahamSC you spineless, gutless man. I hope you're ashamed of yourself
I never had a doubt. All posturing & empty talk .@LindseyGrahamSC
I feel we have only 1 party It is frightening & scares me 2 death My meds arent cheap. How can they do this to us. I could 
Disgusting
@GOP thinks if they resist for 5 minutes & then remit they're being strong. It's more cowardly because they knew all along how they'd vote.
@HoneyDemForce  The senator is a liar as well as a chump.
Threats and posture, Graham is the fraud, the bill dtinks and he knows it. Back to emergency room care for your constituents.
Please don't do it Sir!
Please vote against it Sir.
@LindseyGrahamSC  is a coward and no better than the rest of the @GOP #traitor #murder #immoral #
How much was he given? I read Port man was offered $$ for his vote. I bet they're buying every vote they can!!!
@LindseyGrahamSC & @SenMcCain will prove to the biggest hypocrites in the history of Senate. They voted 180 deg opposite of what they spoke.
You @JohnCornyn and all the GOP have lost your way. Just a sad, shameful day for the democratic process you claim to cherish.
remember this is who graham is and has always need. he uses isssues to try and formulate balanced persona. it is fundamentally untrue
The guy waffles more than a Rotarian breakfast.
Proving what he says and what he does are two different things. Another asshat.
Sounds like John McCain

@ChristineParini POS grandstander.BlackmailedOr just needs attention.SAD
