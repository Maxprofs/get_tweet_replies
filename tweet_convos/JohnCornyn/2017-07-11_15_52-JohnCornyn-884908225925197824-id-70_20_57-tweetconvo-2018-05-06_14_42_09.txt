Fellow constituents, shall we form a bureau so John will meet with us?
I'm in...
@JohnCornyn is this a new farm bill a reauthorization or a completely new one? Plz explain 
What did you learn?
Thank you for meeting with @TexasFarmBureau President Russell Boening today Senator. Trade, taxes and the farm bill are important to Ag.
By continuing to support the Trump presidency, you are aiding and abetting a hostile foreign power intent on our destruction
I bet you are! When are you going to meet with your constituents to discuss all the bullshit dealings you have going on in Washington?
I know cows are more on your intellectual level but maybe do something about the infestation of Russian stooges in the WH first?
Happy to take the check from Russell Boening today for doing what I should do as a Texas senator.
When do you plan to discuss trade, taxes and the upcoming farm bill with your constituents?  #TownHall #DoYourJob

Is there a transcript of the meeting for your constituents to read?
Curious how you feel abt giving Texan vote data over to admin that was just outed for colluding with foreign entity that hacked the vote?
Why aren't you doing anything about a foreign government throwing our election???
Would be happy to see you acknowledge the news of treason by your buddy's @POTUS son @DonaldJTrumpJr
The Senator reminds Texans whom he works for by showing them whom he'll speak with. To the rest of you: More convenient to tweet than meet.
Thats it, nothing about the House of Trump, stop covering for the 
Anything to avoid those pesky town halls
Ready to lock them up yet? I mean, a President was impeached for a blow job, surely this is worthy? Or do rules not apply to @GOP? #treason
I'd be happy if you'd #DoYourJob & call out tRump's #Collusion & put #CountryOverParty #2020iscoming
Was @TXFBinsurance there for another payoff Johnny?? #180K
You are so cute with your ..WHATEVER!  Avoid the news, avoid America, avoid Texas, avoid patriotism, avoid what's right, avoid common sense!

Love the boots, Senator!
Deafening silence and random tweeting.  Exactly what we expect from you.
You really have no shame at all, do you?
You've been on twitter a lot today! Weird that you haven't commented on today's biggest story?  complicit? #TrumpTreason
Still waiting on your thoughts about this whole Russia deal with @realDonaldTrump. I'm sure you stand w/the #traitor.

Did you discuss Russian interference and traitors in the White House? USA flames U do nothing #traitor
So sick to see you continue supporting tax breaks for the rich.
When are you going to start defending our country from foreign interference and doing your damn job? Your legacy will be horrendous
"Grifters of Putin" @GOP
I bet he has great health care coverage
You're still a putz for supporting Treasonous @realDonaldTrump.
Do you have ANYTHING to say about the bombshell revelations about colluding with Russia during the election? Asking for America.
Yes, we would all like your thoughts on Trump selling our election to the Russians. Would you happen to know what the going price is?
you cross your legs like you’ve been castrated, John.
good idea not to speak about your disgusting health care proposal
That mustache makes him look a little fruity. Anyway, get lost, Senator.
Republicare will murder more Americans than all terrorist acts combined.

This is wild. The tax cuts 400 families get from the BCRA equals the Medicaid expansion for 700,000+ people. https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/26/15862002/tax-cuts-ahca-republican-health-plan …
