.@JohnCornyn As my senator I want to know what you're doing to protect our national security?  See letter I faxed to your office. #Kushner
The country is very secure
Not with all the Russian agents sitting in the White House
I meant the southern border . But Russia is huge problem to security
Rex Tillerson is a horrible Secretary of State.  Looked bad at the G19.  What's your current thoughts on Russia?
https://www.facebook.com/TheRawStory/posts/10155565137592235.Shaub … has the inside story. You are teaming with the most corrupt Fool In WH this country has ever had! You will be Toast!
Could you please respond to my question?
.@JohnCornyn As my senator I want to know what you're doing to protect our national security?  See letter I faxed to your office. #Kushner 
He won't .  He's a coward and on the take from our government.  He and Mitch McConnell are spineless-but they make sure they have good HC!
Bribed w/20 million dollars to be spineless traitors!   Follow @funder for documentation proving that.  #TrumpLeaks #TrumpRussia

Trump's alliance with Russia on cybersecurity is a laughable offense.. except it threatens the privacy & national security of Americans
Who in their right mind thinks Breitbart is a reliable and credible source for information?  You're scraping bottom of barrel there, John.
Breitbart?  You couldn't find a si how reputable news source to quote out of the vast independent news outlets?
Has that been cleared through Putin?

You follow Breitbart?? Who are you???
Do you even read the articles or just the headlines? Scary that you're the one making policy for this country. #GetASocialMediaIntern

Y'all need to get this concept through your heads: Trump does not represent the US. He strips and destroys it for himself and benefactors.
What will the GOP do about #45's newest collusion...erm...I mean collaboration with the Russians? CYBER-SECURITY?!? #wegotyournumber

So now our Senator is quoting Breitbart?  Where the town hall meeting?  Why does Trump profit from your fear?
Breibart? Really?  What's next? National Enquirer?  Has the space  landed yet?
Guess you and your RINO buddies need to get behind #FULLrepeal  of Obamacare 
Breitbart?! BREITBART?! Come on @JohnCornyn at least pretend to be unbiased!
You use fake news to site policy impacting the world.
Ok, basically the same framework for Syria, implentation is the hard part, of course.
Please stop reading Breitbart. Please notice that it is propaganda filled with hate.
You're sharing breitbart articles. Good god, man.
Are you seriously pushing Breitbart? Unbelievable
The fact that YOU are sharing Breitbart news tells me everything I need to know about your bigotry and ignorance. You're going down.
Breitbart?
The indoctrination is complete.
Sheep.

#TheResistance
Non-reliable source.
and what about the Trump family who thinks it is ok to destroy our country?
for the love of god stop reading and tweeting breitbart!!!!!
Sir, I am your constituent and I'm embarrassed that you posted something from a propaganda site like Breitbart "News". #URPartOfTheProblem
Every American needs to listen to this. What the   rest of the developed world thinks about our POTUS is critical.
What did we learn about @realDonaldTrump at this #G20? @CUhlmann explains. #Insiders 
Breitbart you got to be kidding me.   You've got to go.  #fakenews.
A bit of prognostication from our Head of State??
Are you seriously citing Breitbart?  You have officially given up all credibility.

are you f***king kidding me? You're quoting Breitbart and calling it news ???? Are you seriously trying to legitimize that rag?

You should be more concerned by this than sharing/spreading @GOP #Breitbart propaganda  @JohnCornyn  #Texas https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/world/national-security/us-officials-say-russian-government-hackers-have-penetrated-energy-and-nuclear-company-business-networks/2017/07/08/bbfde9a2-638b-11e7-8adc-fea80e32bf47_story.html …
Mortifying that a US Senator portrays @BreitbartNews as a credible source.
This is what people around the world think. Only the GOP and part of our media pretend like Trump isn't a complete catastrophe. https://twitter.com/buzzfeednews/status/883888246152765445 …

Hey Trump fans: When Russia wipes out your power grid & your entire city goes dark, are you still going to call this a liberal conspiracy? https://twitter.com/RVAwonk/status/883894790739435520 …
All you do everyday is lie to your constituents
Great...btw...Russia just hacked our grid. But let's get Putin's opinion first right John?
BREAKING: US officials say Russian government hackers have penetrated energy and nuclear company business networks http://wapo.st/2sC3Pi7?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.580a45674eb4 …
Even if true you need to be more discerning when choosing a source of news.  Really Breitbart?

Putin says Trump was 'satisfied' with his election meddling denials http://reut.rs/2sCEtQU  
Luv Trump, distrust most politicians on both sides of isle! Let's take care of American problems & let the rest of World do the Same!
U know just sent a post about Assad , didn't read other posts! So u guys r worried about Bre. News? Worried ur teams Lies will b exposed?
As a long time Rep. conserv. I am wondering why we have Any Right 2 tell Assad anything?? It is His Counyry & None of Our Business!!
White supremacists everywhere are proud of your support for Breitbart.
Breitbart is not real news
Really? I'll believe it when I see it! In meantime WHY NO MENTION OF RUSSIAN GOVT HACKING US NUCLEAR SYSTEMS? WHY???
Bless your heart.
No long term role for @POTUS either.  @POTUS and the @GOP have succeeded in moving the world in a post-US future. where the US not a leader.
Please don't quote breitbart. Please. It's a news outlet for the alt right. Look at Milo, look at who they promote. Just don't.
Unless Putin wants trump to let Assad stay in power then he is in long term. You aren't learning. Or maybe Putin wants him out?
Breitbart again?  Find something with a bit more journalistic integrity.  Like maybe the Enquirer?
Every time you cite Breitbart, I lose a little respect for you.

Currently I'm at -1437.
How much lower senator? You've gone further than I thought you might. Please stop.
You're going insane! Reading this material will get your campaign funds from the Russians.
Breitbart???? Really???? Pathetic.
Shouldn't your concern start with POTUS blatant disrespect of U.S. press, IC & lack of plan to protect us against Russia? Why so quiet John?
Now I get why you haven't spoken out against Russ connex, etc. You like that perfume SNL mentioned. What was its name??... oh yeah.Complicit
Breitbart is crap.  This is ur source of info?  U keep proving over and over again how unfit u r for a job of such import and magnitude.
You're quoting Breitbart?  Ye gads, Senator. And I thought snark was unbecoming . You have reached an impressive new low . I am appalled.
@RexTilllerson why do you still have Obamas people working for you? Are you an Obamas team. Get rid of them or resign
Here's a legit source that can be clicked w/o lining Steve Bannon's pockets. And BTW, he said this back in April:
I cannot believe that my Senator just endorsed Breitbart. Shameful! Sir, you are not representing us very well.
Please do not EVER mention ANYTHING relating to breitbart! You might as well talk about the headlines of the national enquirer!!!!
where have we heard that before?...

Breitbart? Are you kidding me. Who the hell writes your tweets for you? Baby Skinhead Bannon Jr?
Cornyn posting Breitbart? A new low. Why not post National Enquirer too? Geez, John. Have you no sense of self worth?
#FakeNews
Breitbart?!? Cite real news only
Breitbart? WTH
Seriously? Quoting breibart? Now that's the definition of fake news
We, your constituents, are critical thinkers who trust thoughtful journalism, not sketchy blogs. Please cite legitimate news sources.
Oh FFS. Here, read something of value-

Says a lot when you quote Breitbart! WE MUST VOTE THIS FAKE NEWS PUSHER TRAITOR OUT OF OFFICE! It is our duty as Americans!
Breitbart eh? Racist roots out in the open now.
FFS.... Breitbart, senator? You've gone over the edge.

Sad!
I, too, am startled, Senator Cornyn--Breitbart. Explains a lot.
Oh goody, Breitbart. I always believe what they say.
Who do you propose to replace him with, an Islamist regime? What happens to the Christians if Assad falls? Neocon line.
You are grossly underestimating the intelligence of the American voter. Do better.
And Putin quickly agreed? Doubtful.
Tillerson stated that the US would follow Russia's policy as it was "more right than the US" you seem unaware of the administrations' policy
...and there it is. Quoting Breitbart news. This is what you, my Senator, thinks is NEWS? CNN has issues but it isn't a white power front.
Just throwing that out there? Just future regime change and war plans? You must know more than the generals. The @GOP must go ...
OMG!! Quit sharing Breitbart articles!! What the hell is wrong with you?!
Breitbart. You couldn't find the same quote from a reputable source?
Not a fan of Bretbart either but
http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/08/politics/us-russia-leaders-syrian-conflict-analysis/index.html …
Come on now, you're referencing Breibart?
Exactly.
It's only been 1000 years.
