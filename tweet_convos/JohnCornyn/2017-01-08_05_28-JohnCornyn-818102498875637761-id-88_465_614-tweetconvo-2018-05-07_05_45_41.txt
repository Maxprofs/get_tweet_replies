.@Heritage can't stop lying about Obamacare. Its success despite GOP obstructionism shows GOP lies for what they are.
You're kidding!  My policy, for myself and my husband,  went up 60% this yr, 33% last year. Rise was $1000/mo.
An anecdote is no substitute for actual facts/ stats showing millions benefit from ACA. Or that insurers raise prices @masuruha2 @Heritage
Just as they did before the ACA. ACA didn't change fact that premiums ultimately imposed by insurers who set rates. @masuruha2 @Heritage
Aca gave insurers incentives to provide policies but GOP continues undermining it, keeping premiums inflated. @masuruha2 @Heritage
Scaring insurers off marketplaces and ppl without insurance lose out bc GOP controlled states didn't expand Medicaid @masuruha2 @Heritage
Yet we have stats from ACA policies and costs because of transparency. That's missing on employer based insurance. @masuruha2 @Heritage
But please go on telling us how 20 million with insurance is worse off or that hospital solvency is bad thing @masuruha2 @Heritage
so sorry, my mom still in ICU,, she started bad too
Thank you neighbor!
@tedcruz @DailySignal 
NO one knows better then the middle class, who don't qualify for subsidies and can't afford the rate hikes
@tedcruz @DailySignal True. My policy is $1549 with no subsidy. I do not even use it. High deductible.
Exactly! Nuts isn't it.
@tedcruz ...while others who were uninsurable before now have coverage.
y r they @ER?  Use ins 4 Drs urgent care so we don't have 2cover costs!my deduct $2500 now scale SUCKS
After threats and fines, a mere 20 million enrolled. That is only 6%. #FullRepeal
@tedcruz what a crock ! C'mon Charles Koch , you can lie better than that.
@JohnCornyn @tedcruz So what's the plan, Republicans???
FALSE! Lier! #TREASON
@LindaSuhler @DailySignal 56 yr old single woman, premium $1,150 per month; very high deductible & out-of-pocket
Or maybe it's just insurance companies are getting out of insurance?  Nothing to do with the ACA (except politics)?
.@JohnCornyn @DailySignal @Heritage it is still sad to see you're still in office. It shoud have been @DwayneStovall #RINO
not according to your fellow Texas Republicans
>18 mill spent during the last election cycle = weak.
@tedcruz @DailySignal after obamacare my insurance more than doubled and coverage went down
@tedcruz @DailySignal I really do not think Mr Cruz has ever had to struggle getting health insurance. Gives us an alternative.
why is health care working in other countries but not here? DRUG LOBBYISTS/trump Are GOING SKYROCKET Ur HEALTHCARE!
@tedcruz @DailySignal if so many more ppl have ins y was ER packed w/ppl w/ the flu & not at urgent care or drs office????
We figured out how to pay for health care.  Don't pay $3K/mo premiums & join a co'op for catastrophic protection.
@RepShimkus @DailySignal 
Didn't Heritage anticipate this when they drafted the white paper on it?
#SinglePayer
Heritage has fallen on hard times, has become idealogues rather than credible researchers.
what is passed by budget recon can be #FullRepeal by budget recon
@JohnCornyn Whatever. You're gonna take ACA away. I'm gonna die. Then I can't vote against you. I lost. You won.
Many Americans have affordable insurance that they couldn't get before. What is your plan?
Republicans Fabricating BS daily
ALL Americans w/ ins., tho, fully assured 85% of premiums spent on care w/ no lifetime cap or pre-ex. cond. penalty. Winning!
2017 we opted out of health insurance. Using @CMFCURO for medical sharing.
Can't afford $13k yr, + $13k out pocket
@veganvecoh It's time the insurance companies were audited for fraud.
Mandatory participation did not cause Market competition word. Insurance Companies had us hostage to pay whatever price they want.
We must find a way to get complete price transparency into every facet of medical   services.
@LindaSuhler @DailySignal and medicaid has expanded til it's ready to burst
@tedcruz @DailySignal was this not a Heritage Foundation idea ?
is in favor of preventable death of thousands of Americans.
#ACA #acaworks #ACARepealDebate #MakeAmericaSickAgain #killerGOP
Obama care is bankrupting the middle class, crashing the health care system. It is Unaffordable!! Repeal it!!
Dont let fake think tanks fool you. @Heritage @DailySignal
THE IMPORTANT THING IS -- NOT TO LET YOU FOOL US !! BAH- HUMBUG!
LMAO preconditions? death panels? drop insurance when claims filled, all your butt buddies desires for profits 2UR cash pockets
And 30 million gained coverage. No denial for pre-existing conditions, ins. to 26, no lifetime caps #heritagefoundationkillspeople
For the first time in my life, I don't have health insurance.
And @barackobama lied his ass off, again, on #thisweek re Ocare.

@Heritage @Coondawg68 @AlyeneSenger
Many Americans face fewer insurer options, higher insurance deductibles, and higher premiums than before Obamacare. http://bit.ly/2hSrV6X 
Obamacare will be replaced by a hybrid of private insurance & a government subsidized program for those who can't afford it
to those loving this tweet, they have no understanding or care to understand what the Heritage Foundation represent!
we were deceived.
Propaganda from the pit of hell. Enough already.
@JohnCornyn @DailySignal
@tedcruz @DailySignal if it's a success why are insurance companies bailing out of it. Has the MSM changed the meaning of success.
@tedcruz @DailySignal Not fooled by you. Premiums rose because Congress bailed on their risk mitigation obligations to insurers.
this is the real truth. Republicans don't want to admit the truth.
@JohnCornyn @tedcruz  @DailySignal still waiting to hear the details of your replacement plan
@tedcruz @AlyeneSenger what is the hold up?
and BCBS in Alabama just announced they dropped CVS from their pharmacy list...also dropped my psoriasis medication
Get insurance out of healthcare. Provide care directly. Insurance is a third party that doesn't get you care and adds cost, delay
@tedcruz @DailySignal But exactly how many more people actually have coverage than before Obamacare?  Was it 30 million?
@JohnCornyn @DailySignal false
wrong. Sad.
@tedcruz it was designed for the designers to become filthy rich at the purchasers expense
that's because people who newly have insurance are using it.  Repeal will only hurt those with health issues
It's tough to control the insurance companies who want to make  huge profits. Obamacare cuts into their profits  so they raise the premiums
@tedcruz @DailySignal it's a copy of the plan you proposed. Originally on your website and pushed by you for years.
You mean Health Care plan, the ACA, that originated in the Heritage Foundation? But Repub's suddenly were against? Oh, OK
You wrote romneycare and thus obamacare. So you who wrote the failed policy are going to fix it?
@tedcruz  Will it be replaced? My daughter is self employed with auto-immune disorders. What are her options?
@tedcruz @AlyeneSenger : Lol read Dark Money by Jane Mayer if you want a heads up on the Heritage Foundation. Koch & others.
Lawhawk: Tell us about your obama care plan. The folks that love it generally aren't on it.
@tedcruz I read the article! To paraphrase: "repeal the law and we have no idea or plan what we'll do after that." Great solution!
@tedcruz @DailySignal keep plugging away, Ted. Repeal this unlawful tax and redistribution of the meager wealth middleclass has.
@tedcruz @AlyeneSenger @heritage is propaganda crafted by special interest rich assholes who hate America
Rich I am far from. Hard working born in USA I am. When will lay down sword?
@tedcruz @DailySignal I know for a fact that Obamacare has failed. Let pelosi and schumer sign up for it if they love it so much
@tedcruz So get it done!!!
@tedcruz no people can get insurance now who couldn't in the past with pre-existing conditions
@tedcruz @DailySignal Who is fooling who, Ted? Can we see the better plan that the GOP has? Where is it, Ted? Let us see it now.
you must get it free or subsidies, talk to the millions who pay    over thousand a mth.
@tedcruz @DailySignal agree
My Neighbor pars the same for their health care as I do for my house a month How is that affordable??
Premiums so high you never get to use your insurance, just pay for it. Obama Care sucks
Millions more now covered. You know of course that the PPACA IS A HERITAGE PLAN.
my higher premiums & deductibles started long before the ACA
@tedcruz @Heritage DON'T MESS WITH SOCIAL SECURITY
"Many". LOL.
EVERYONE needs to reach out to Congressional leadership & their state's members of Congress. ACA MUST be fixed ASAP!
thanks to Heritage Foundation's Romneycare model for Obamacare adaptation...take ownership!
That's laughable.
