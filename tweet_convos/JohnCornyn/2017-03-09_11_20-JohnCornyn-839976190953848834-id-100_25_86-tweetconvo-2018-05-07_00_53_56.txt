highest bidder, corporations big business owns them and his lips/tongue.
confirm right after Garland!! #DoYourJob
Wow.  Talk about a rubber stamp.  Party line all the way.  Do you even think at all any more?
you Gus hardly get there and it's time for another vacation
@JohnCornyn Why dies it need to wait until Gorsuch confirmation? Do us a favor and go on vacation & never return!
why? You didn't do you job for president   Obama ' s nominee. Are you racist?
#Gorsuch hearings start same day as #TrumpRussia investigation. Let @GOP  know we're paying attention!
#StopGorsuch
apparently your recess started already.  You don't care about Iowans. You care only about kissing Trump's ass
Then you all better get on that special prosecutor for Russiagate. Also, since Trump is out campaigning, that's a problem.
Will there be public town hall in Polk then? U ignore all of my correspondence. Have a few thoughts to share. #DoYourJob
NO. NO. NO!!! NO TO GORSUCH!
2022 is a long way away. But your constituents have long memories.
Still think Gorsuch will be confirmed Senator? I'm betting on at least 2 defections that will nuke the nuclear option.
Do you all ever work?  It's one recess after another !!
Merrick Garland. Is there any other reason you blocked him besides #racism?
hey Chuck we Iowans don't want Trumpnocare health care plan!
You guys work so hard, you need some more time off.
- shouldn't there be a sarcasm font for this??
Comic sans?
- Ha Ha, yep, it's comic alright!
@JohnCornyn So the twelfth of Never?  I'm okay with that.
You have to be kidding. #DoYourJob
@JohnCornyn , another vacation?  Do you guys ever actually work?
So if you can't get him confirmed by 4/8 will you be staying in DC?
Your partisanship on the judicial nominations is contemptible.
RESIGN.
trump is campaigning for 2020. We should delay this confirmation for the next president to pick since it's campaign season.
@JohnCornyn ha ha.  No recess for you I'm betting.
GREAT!!!!!!!!
@JohnCornyn gee do these guys ever work???
Boooooo!!!!! MERRICK GARLAND
it is so sad how you have manipulated this country. It makes me cry
that might be awhile as your committee has not had a hearing on Garland yet.
@JohnCornyn We don't consider anyone but Garland legit.
no rush chuckles
Sure, when is the independent investigation into Trump colluding with Russia before and after the election.
@JohnCornyn but no nominee can be considered during election campaign. Trump filed for re-election 5 hrs after inauguration

My god---you guys headed out on your paid vacations AGAIN?  How about town halls?
@JohnCornyn good I hope he is not confirmed til April 15. I want you to work more so I get my $$'s worth.I pay your Insurance
@JohnCornyn Interesting excuse to avoid meeting constituents during recess..
@JohnCornyn why are you goofing off at all? Will potus be? Much important work! 
@JohnCornyn hope it goes well
@JohnCornyn Goodness gracious, you are all so hypocritical it's truly breathtaking.
You misspelled Garland.
Stand up!  Flynn, Russia & Turkey.  EPA Director going against what educated scientist say!  When is ENOUGH, ENOUGH?!
@JohnCornyn You just got back from a vacation! #DOYOURJOB #YOUWORKFORUS
@JohnCornyn U MF owe  Merrick Garland an apology for disrespecting him!
@JohnCornyn With all the unconfirmed Trump appointees, why are you not working in session six days per week.
.
what a job, do nothing, sell US down the river, make great money and go vacation ... your voters are such fools!
@JohnCornyn Recess for what? You're not holding town hall meetings. Get to work!!
That's a shame you won't be getting home for Easter.
you have destroyed scotus legitimacy
Probably no vacation for you, then. Sad!
no recess or rest for the wicked.
It's almost as if Chuck has made up his mind before the hearings.

#nothappening
that was President Obama's seat to fill. The GOP is shady and the voters  will not forget.
Hey Chuck! When is Christmas break?
Hope Gorsuch never gets confirmed bc Congress might be n town long enuf 2 get something done. Wishful thinking I'm afraid.
Baptists worship a false god, Chuck. I can surmise this by reviewing your voting record.
and as a better practical matter, FOCUS on Russia.
as a practical matter, Merrick Garlands confirmation hearings should have been held a year ago.
Right after the Merrick Garland confirmation hearing.
By the way, I believe Christ loved us all, but that we shouldn't impose some people's religious beliefs on everyone.
but if we pick one state religion I vote we go back to Episcopal Church. Reasonable thoughtful group, tolerant of others
Sorry; Merrick Garland
#MerrickGarland hearing should come as soon as Trump stops campaigning. Which apparently will be after he is impeached.
Merrick Garland.
Trump is campaigning in Nashville nxt week. Repubs said no confirm during campaign when it came to Garland. Trump is STILL
campaigning and fundraising. So no confirmations according to @MitchMcConell. Right, Mr Ethics? #resist #russia
I thought the precedent was no hearings in the last year of a presidency?
you misunderestimated, that was the president. No wait...Damn. #russiagate has me distracted.
NO Senate Recess until SCOTUS confirmation of Gorsuch
Boom! Goes the dynamite! Nobody is going home till the work gets done! #GrassleyWorks
Respectfully, did your campaign accept Russian money? Just curious.
so you are cool with no recess then? Because this is how you get no recess.
maybe it should start after you all #ImpeachTrump and help your constituents
hopefully never
you mean after Garland confirmed. Public open forum in populous city large venue at 7pm so working people can attend?
You people take too much time off. To meet with constituents my arse. Get to work.
maybe if you started working as hard as you expect your constituents to something would actually get done in congress.
Good to hear that something huge will happen before you guys go on recess!
Did a second seat open up on #SCOTUS? The first one is already spoken for. #MerrickGarland
no, you're mistaken, Garland wasn't ever confirmed
I'm aware, and still waiting for the Senate to do its fucking job instead of trying to skip the line.
....what?
