Killing poor Americans by the millions
So disappointing, @kaybaileyhutch
@JohnCornyn isn't trying to reform healthcare, he's trying to kick millions off of healthcare.  Another Republican selling out Americans.
"Reform healthcare coverage"? You mean "remove healthcare coverage".
we want full repeal and i want to full repeal him in his next election he is as much of the swamp as you where
You will NEVER get full repeal of law that benefits millions.  You were lied to for 7 years.  Not enough GOP votes to repeal the ACA, sucker
You can't call it 'reform' when you're just ripping the rug out from under millions of people.
Like Ocare did to 6 mil right?
Actually, it helped more than it harmed and frankly universal healthcare works. The majority of the developed nations prove it.
6.5 million Americans are paying the fine to the IRS if im correct.. that's not small or good!
Still better than 22 Million w/o coverage. If GOP hadn't been trying to sabotage this every step of the way, it would be better for America.
I still have not mentioned the millions who lost their plans and the millions who lost their doctors or millions who's hours were cut 
And that's why we need to make healthcare coverage universal & stop with the rest of the nonsense. Calling healthcare a business is immoral
I'm not paying for it if I can help.. the countries in Europe are not even remotely close to our population size please see cbo on cost 
I have to say as much as I respect you both it is difficult to understand how a photo op helps any of us.
PLEASE just work w/Ds 2 fix the ACA flaws. ACA is 4 AMERICANS-not a party-and much is good about it. OWN it & b the heros who make it work
As hard as it is to believe, John is a worse senator than you were.
Ha!
No. No you are not. J "luxury" Cornyn won't even read it. Typical Texan LoInfo voter.
I like that, "Lolnfo." Nice.
Hey thanks, but I am only a vessel.
indeed, but credit given, where credit due

Sen.  For the love of all that is holy TAKE THE RED PILL! #RealityCheck
I don't think reform means what you think it means
Don't repeal until we like the replacement!  Bipartisan efforts.  Countrymen over Party. Take care of constituents!
The gov needs to mind their own business and let the free market take over. Health ins is not a right, it's a responsibility. #fullrepeal
You aren't working hard2do anything except take a deeply partisan&unpopular move to take HealthCare frm millions.  All Bcuz of yr Obama Hate
That's a great horse you've hitched yourself to there Kay..a guy who thinks reading a bill b4 voting on it is an unaffordable luxury, genius
No, he's not. He's working hard to give u and every other millionaire swamp creature a huge tax cut, while killing millions of sick people.
The hell he is. Shame on both of you.
.@JohnCornyn says he hasn't read the bill. #Shame
Taking healthcare from millions so that 400 billionaires get a tax cut isn't reform.
You're evil.
Oh God, here comes another bailout
Got a lot more than you thought to fix.
get over this party mentality of who "wins" and actually work for the American public for all of us. PS don't exempt yourselves from it.
Really? he says actually reviewing the bill "is a luxury they can't afford" but he screamed that Dems rammed ACA in after months of review.

Things like THIS are why Obamacare might "fail".

Dinosaurs out of step with your current and former constituents.
Great to see you back. Missed you! #hookem
"Coverage'? This is joke right. cutting taxes for rich donors has nothing to do w/coverage #DarkMoney
Anxious 2 see what It's going 2 look like It has 2 be good for all Americans poor Republicans or Democrats The rich can afford medical care
#FullRepealNow
Bless your heart.
Please stop helping this man destroy our entire healthcare system.

Just stop.
You mean he's working hard to KILL middle and poor Americans. And you are proud of that? GOP has no common decency. #ShameOnGOP

Hi Kay. Happy to see you back in politics as you were always one of my favorites
Actually, he's working to gut it. Think carefully about entangling yourself in this mess of an administration.

The @SenateGOP health care bill released today is the worst one yet: 
You misspelled "working hard for a tax cut for the 1% by taking away healthcare from 32 million people."

BREAKING: In rare joint letter, insurers say Cruz amendment "unworkable in any form" and will lead to "widespread terminations of coverage."

To be clear, Obamacare isn't failing. @realdonaldtrump is sabotaging it.

We find no evidence of the individual market collapsing. Rather, insurers on track to have best year since ACA began http://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/individual-insurance-market-performance-in-early-2017/ …

.@SenatorCollins to @ThisWeekABC: GOP health care bill "would make sweeping and deep cuts in the Medicaid program." http://abcn.ws/2tfyJkR  
You're absolutely deceiving yourself if you think he's working hard to reform healthcare. He's actively trying to kick people off insurance.
reform or sabotage
Texans Do Not Want Horse Slaughter Plants Opened again In Texas Dirty Sleazy business worst then Drug dealersNo Bioterrorism in Texas
Looking forward to both of you being former senators
In secret. With 12 other old white men. Against the wishes of the American people.
LOL he won't include current female senate colleagues in discussions but needs a hand from the past. #cornygoals
Remind Cornyn that TX is in the top 20 ranking of states with highest poverty. Poor people matter and need health care.
I used to respect you Kay...
Seven years later and now you're starting to "work hard" on health care reform? What the hell have you been doing?
Oh just stop! Praising this vile person is beneath you! And the HC plan is awful....everyone knows it! Including repubs!
I think you misspoke. He's working hard to line his pockets.
@JoeNBC @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @GOP @tedcruz  @RepKevinBrady @POTUS  @SenateDems   You mean working hard to screw the American People 2018
no, he's working hard to give tax breaks disguised as Health Care reform, 1/5 of US economy blown up in a backroom deal, disgraceful !

Don't let him give you his Russian cooties.
It is wealthcare and are you also 1 of the wealthy who will get a huge tax break as the result of screwing the most vulnerable?
Don't you mean revoke health care coverage for over 30 million Americans?
Let's see a workable health care plan. And some real town halls. All he does is posture for the cameras. And tweet anti-Dem snark.
In which another highly regarded former Senator and/or Representative sells her credibility to Trump.
Whose working hard? #Cornyn is doing nothing to reform HC. He's placating 45 & doing nothing for TX. Can't wait to kick 
his lazy ass out.
A photo op with you does not change who he is or how he operates.  We are not swayed. He does not represent women.
Is operating in secrecy, undermining the non-partisan CBO score, and no public hearings how you remember the Senate?
KBH, ask Jeff Sessions about "friends" in this political climate. Be careful you don't lose your reputation and honor. Good luck.
He did not include current women Senators in drafting health care legislation.  He worked secretly, no hearings?
John is busy selling out our country. #GOPlyingTraitors.
We want it REPEALED!
Not the majority of Americans.
I smell bot....
Working hard to deprive 32 million of health insurance and to eliminate protections for pre-existing conditions.
You and your party of frauds have undermined democracy and betrayed the United States
#CornynMustGo
Reform means taking away HC from 32mil per the CBO. Both of you should be ashamed of yourselves. #TurnTXBlue
#CornynMustGo
The only thing that will improve ACA is single payor. DO NOT ROLLBACK MEDICAID
#CornynMustGo
Single payor is the only thing that will improve ACA. DO NOT ROLLBACK MEDICAID

you are not listening your constituency that wants #FullRepeal #FullRepealNow not reform and not replace. Not a core function of government.
You're beating a dead horse. Repeal is not going to happen. Republicans are in full control & are completely impotent.
#brokencampaignpromises unfortunately most Repubs are for big govt - might as well be Dems if they vote against Republican party platform
Represent well, those of us who elected you! Counting on you!
What he is doing is not healthcare reform, it is a tax bill offering savings from the suffering and deaths of the disabled & poor.
Nice picture! Together again. Congrats on your appointment, Sen. Hutchinson. #Texas Shines.
Nope... Cornyn hasn't worked hard on anything in his life. And certainly not something that benefits others... #worthless
#CornynMustGo
Can’t wait for your nomination hearing. Grateful for your willingness to continue serving Senator Hutchison.
