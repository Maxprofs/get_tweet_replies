And they say there are no good conservative comedians…
I guess this crap BS you've posted here is supposed to be a distraction from the latest Don Jr stuff tonight.  It's not working.
YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT?? Why are you putting @GOP before the American people?? #russiagate
@larry_kudlow praises our current strong energy position while failing to mention it happened after 8 years of Obama, not 6 months of Trump.
A US Senator tweeted this... words escape
Seriously, you are MY Senator!!!?? You are an embarrassment.
I'll always remember how @SallyQYates exposed you for literally not understanding how the law works. #credibilitydeficit
That was awesome! 
Her schooling both Cornyn and @tedcruz was glorious. A little disturbing just how clueless Cornyn was though. He needs a new job.
That fuck was attorney general of TX. #johncornyn
That is very sad. I did not know that and am kind of stunned now that I do.
Then you don't want to know who the current AG is! 
I am a little afraid of the answer.

No one else has seen this metaphorical "barrel". Hallucinations like this are a sign of mental illness. You should get help.
I suppose you also support the Trump/Putin Cyber Security venture too?   Come on..admit it!!  YOU'VE SOLD US ALL OUT!

John Cornyn, We need Russia to help our Economy to grow we need trade in Natural Resources.  We need Russia for World Security
OH Don Jr is FAKE NEWS too right??  Aren't those your escape words when you don't want your constituents to know the truth?  #TRAITOR
WHAT????
The USA is very quickly becoming a gas station also. Why does congress allow oil companies to export our children's future energy supply?
Well now, two days later do you still think Trump has Putin over a barrel? Not very likely. Where do you stand with the latest developments?
What is wrong with you, @TeamCornyn?
Trump Jr met Kremlin-linked lawyer after being told it was part of Russian Gov't effort to collude and help Trump.  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/us/politics/donald-trump-jr-russia-email-candidacy.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&smid=nytcore-iphone-share …

Looks like the National Review and Cornyn's Twitter have been hacked, too
.......... are you high, John?
when they #impeach #Trump after they get (may already have)his #taxes #Barrel will be least of worries #BARS
I thought CNBC was fake news? You are Larry are as only interested making the rich richer. $$$$$$$$$$$$$$
LOL!!!!

The email I saw to Don Jr. communicated Putin strongly supports Trump and was happy to do anything he could to undermine American democracy.
Do you still support this 'hot take', Big Bad John?
@texasdemocrats @TexasGOP 
#CountryOverParty
So where's your comment about Don Jr admitting he met with a Russian lawyer who said she might have information helpful to the campaign?
I still can't believe you have this tweet up. It's like you're not even trying to sound credible anymore. SMH #CorruptGOP
WHAT A JOKE, and you are a failure.
John, in my book you are complicit to the administrations connection to Russia in the run up to the election. You've sat and DONE NOTHING.
I don't think so President Vladimir Putin is Brilliant and very strong,  he will never be pushed around by anyone.  We should respect him.
Troll
John what a fool you have become. A joint cybersecurity team as key takeaway. Then Trump says it will never happen. Do you take Russian oppo
I'm sorry but tonight I'm fed up with the BULLSHIT from you guys.  Signed a FORMER REPUBLICAN.  TIME TO PUT COUNTRY BEFORE PARTY!!
Exactly!   
It amazes me to see how many Republicans especially GOP politicians are still sticking with @realDonaldTrump.
The only reason why they stick with him is the distraction he makes so they can shove their agendas through.  Thus Party over Country.
I get that but it is still very unpatriotic, unethical and outright wrong. They represent the minority of voters in presidency and senate!
Case and point: we're all talking about Don jr today while Repubs like @JohnCornyn R loving the distraction to cut Medicaid.  Sick
Senator please stand up for the state of Texas and for US Constitution!! #youmessdwithtexas #midterms
Wrong again pal.
Your support for Trump makes me sick. You are one of the reasons why I left your pathetic party that puts PARTY BEFORE COUNTRY.
holy shit, a state elected you to public office?
Sadly, he and Cruz are "my" Senators.  Corrupt to the core.
talk about a double whammy
Oh John. What does Russia have on you?
Truth is that you're the one over a barrel. Where is your statement regarding the undeniable proof of Trump colluding with foreign hostile?
Please do not get distracted from caring about the health of your beloved Texans.
Lol!  Was this a funny post??  I vote in TX
Do you believe this BS? If so, you need to go. Actually, you need to go no matter what. #corrupt #drainTheGOPswamp
Dear lord, you can't be serious. That's the dumbest statement I've read all day. Considering what a day it's been, quite an accomplishment.
Um,  over a barrell. You're pants down over a barrel.@RoyBluntMO @SpeakerRyan @thehill @CNN about to file to have you trumptards out #russia
I scrolled the comments for 5 min and saw not 1 response agreeing with you. You are completely ineffective and an absolute incompetent.
Oh, good, another dementia-riddled old man in a position of power. THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
I need what you are smoking!  Or drinking.
It appears your mental faculties are in serious need of rehabilitation. Perhaps retirement & some time back in Russia will help.
Back-Assward
If by "over a Barrel" you mean tRump is bending over it with Putin standing behind him!
Putin owns Trump.......Trump is his puppet. BIGLY!
You're more screwy than Trump if you truly believe that...
Ha ha ha another joke. You're so cool
How much Russian money laundering have you been personally involved in .@JohnCornyn ? What are you doing to protect our national security?
I believe you are delusional & brainwashed by your own propaganda.  Putin has #TraitorTrump over a Barrel T is #PutinsPuppet You KNOW IT
How many $$$ from Russia did you get ? 
#Traitor 
#GOPthenewpartyofRussia
What are you smoking?
Little John, I am assuming this is a joke.  Right?
Ohmigod you are the most corrupt man in the Senate. Tell us again how the sky is green!
Putin has Trump IN a barrell
I don't know what you've been reading
It's the other way around, john. How far are you repubics going to allow this treason to continue? What does tRump have over you, john?
Or do the Russians have the Trumps, USA and EXXON oil over a barrel? #ImpeachTrump
Senator, you've got to be kidding.
That's gaslighting at its finest. Totally off the wall insane.  
Oh, Lawd, you Republicans are truly cult members!!! Putin is playing chess, and poor Donny the Traitor is playing Pick up Sticks. Sad!
