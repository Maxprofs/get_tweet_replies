Yes we already apologized for the mistake, a typo, it's Medicaid that's reduced to pay for ending ACA taxes. https://twitter.com/JohnCornyn/status/880916056726003715 …
But what makes the state's part in your estimate? The part depending on States is a cut since they're broke.
Yep -- not that you've done anything to talk our Governor into opening up Medicaid subsidies for Texas -- part of why it's so high.
Liar.
Do you even know what you're arguing for? I mean, I know it's to win one for trump, but what is the root of why you keep selling this?
As a former Republican, I can say that John has lost his love for America and democracy. He was, past tense, a man of honor. He lost path.
Yes, I do remember that. Unfortunateky, we must look at how and what he is now.
we are so tired of your twisting the truth about ACA ... You will say anything to put it down because of your hatred
Why don't you show the country TX cares & work with Dems? Would go a long way to healing divide.
It was before ACA. ACA bent the curve downwards.
Only until 2026. Nice try Senator.
Baloney. Unless you truly are of below average intelligence, you know that it's "going up" means nothing. You essentially lie to Americans
Do your job and fix the ACA. Otherwise you are wasting time and not representing Texans. Texas deserves better than Cornyn and Cruz.
#shame
Loud, angry chants of SHAME as Trump's motorcade arrives @ Trump Hotel for fundraiser 
I love those peeps, thank you!!!
But less than inflation resulting in a a 35% cut by 2026
Oh oh oh, look! Another lie!
You are lying through your false teeth!  It will be disbanded by 2026!! IN NINE (9) YEARS!!!  $180K  FOR YOU JOHNNY!

Tax breaks for @JohnCornyn's billionaire donors.
When @realDonaldTrump is removed from office, we can never forget how long and hard @JohnCornyn fought for his corrupt administration.
Yes it goes up. People get sick tax the rich more
At the same rate? If not, then it's a cut. You might not be good at math, but I am.
And congress does nothing to curb increased healthcare costs by unscrupulous pharmaceuticals
Keep Standing Together with President Trump, get the bill passed, Great Job Senator Cornyn
So does fraud, waste & out of control inflation within delivery of medical services and big pharma. Your solution? Screw the most vulnerable
It's a 35% cut over time, John. Quit lying to us.
@govtrack Medicaid is WORKING. Fix ACA marketplaces & lower costs & ACA will b stable. Give up ur stupid tax cuts for rich ppl!
TX 2026-1.89m lose medicaid =46% total enrolled; if all >21 lost, 1/3 enrolled kids wld still lose. No room pop  or 130k on waiver WL.
Not looking good here crony boy
This texan demands ACA improved with single payer option. A lot of old ranchers feel just like me. Your plan will break me
This is a great topic for a town hall. Please post your schedule.
BWAHAHAHA A typo and ur doing a happy dance! U foolish foolish man!
You mean like the population? Ha.., go figure...!
BullShit! John, because YOU sabotaged it. Get with the program. Healthcare is not a "Market". It is a Human Right!
It's going to do that regardless of what is done or who does it.
Which you'd know if you read the emails I sent your staffers. It's the Brookings Inst pdf.

After a $772 billion cut, yes? Doesn't matter if it keeps going up if you slash 26% of the budget immediately beforehand.
@govtrack you're cutting it by 800 billion dollars.
They were talking about Medicaid, not your bank account.
Bribed senator.  You are the worst kind of American
23,000,000+
Just not nearly enough.

Of course it does. Prices for most things go up each year. It's called inflation.
It would have gone up any way because all of u refuse to do the right thing for the American people. It's all about politics & party favors

Medicaid spending would be 26 percent lower in 2026 ... the gap would widen to about 35 percent in 2036
Hmmm. Maybe it's time for a bill making it a Federal offense for an elected official to deliberately lie to/mislead American citizens.
Better yet, Just don't touch it all. Leave it as is and remove tax savings from the bill. Easy!
Just like the cost of healthcare in general. Under Obamacare the rate of increase actually fell.
Another win.
Of course it goes up every year. The POPULATION goes up every year. And your trickle-down plans will continue to increase income inequality.
Please don't pretend total numbers out of context are meaningful. I know you're not that stupid.
U forgot the 2nd half of the sentence: "but not enough to keep up with inflation, etc, which is how we pay for the big tax cut for the rich"
Yes! #MAGA Let an unconscious patient shop around for the best prices on life-saving treatments! Brilliant!
But the increase rate's1.6%/yr under BCRA while conservative estimate of medical cost+population growth is 4.7% in ACA. U cut 3%/yr frm ACA!
@govtrack town hall?
That's not honest.  It goes up year after year because costs go up, but with each year you cover less people.  #GOPDeathCarePlan
What is IRS and Interstate Commerce People doing in this healthcare act.  Repeal the Damn thing.

1.9% increase. You want to tell Texans what healthcare costs were rising before ACA (and even after though slower)? People will be hurt.
DUH! WE KEEP GETTING MORE POOR, SICK PEOPLE YEAR AFTER YEAR!

CONNECT. THE. DOTS.
Why do you support taking healthcare away from vulnerable Texans?
How come you can't look at the rest of the world and take the very best from each country with univ healtcare to implement for us?
Single Payer. Costs will plummet.

Shameless.

Does your conscience sting at all? Ever?
It's a tax cut for the Koch's. Period. The end. #worstsenatorinusa
Medicaid is significantly reduced. And that means the coverage for elderly and young is significantly reduced. Scrap the 250+ tax cut.

This chart from the CBO report really says it all: low income Americans are asked to pay higher premiums for less generous coverage.

This is wild. The tax cuts 400 families get from the BCRA equals the Medicaid expansion for 700,000+ people. https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/26/15862002/tax-cuts-ahca-republican-health-plan …
John, are you contractually obligated with the Kochs to be a partisan hack?
#shame
"Just vote no!" protesters chant outside of GOP Sen. Cory Gardner's office. Demonstrators have sprawled out across Republican offices.. 
Are you trying to Cornyn us again?
#AHCA WILL BE MURDER. #LIAR
Protesters with disabilities stage a "die-in" over cuts to Medicaid outside of Sen. Mitch McConnell's office.
