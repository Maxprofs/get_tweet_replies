So sad...
Why did congress let CHIP expire and senator Graham is retweeting this while ignoring that?
Because leftists LIKE those nations
Get off your high horse of "Whataboutism"
Hey... Late term is usually met by someone who wanted baby but something went terribly wrong. Double punishing them is evil
how many times have we seen this bullshit. Only the GOP
Abortions should only be for Republican elected officials, their families and their mistresses.  http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/03/politics/tim-murphy-abortion/index.html?sr=twCNNp100317tim-murphy-abortion0634PMStory&CNNPolitics=Tw …
Again, sometimes abortions after 5 months are medically needed
Katelynn, could you provide an example of a situation in which it would be medically needed? I know giving birth can be life threatening.
You won't get an answer. At the most, rage.
It appears you were correct Buzzard. No answer it is. 
And what about the fact that we’re the only major country that doesn’t guarantee healthcare for all, Lindsey? GOP is full of hypocrites.
Carlin's comment:
Lol. RT'd by Lindsey Graham. He ain't gettin' NO ONE pregnant. Not that there's anything wrong with that...
@LindseyGrahamSC, you realize that except for North America, the rest are backwards, third-world countries full of idiots in charge...right?
Loser Graham, shut up.

Research: Bans on abortion after 20 weeks disproportionately affect young people & poor people #NoAbortionBan http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1363/4521013/full … https://twitter.com/ReproRights/status/914897770560888833 …
https://twitter.com/usageb170/status/915340815408537600 … Because it is our right as women to do with our bodies what we want. No MAN has the right to tell us what to do.
Call your Senators now! #HR36 passed. GOP again wants to tell women what they can/can't do with their bodies. So annoying #NoAbortionBan https://twitter.com/NationalNOW/status/915338259651276800 …
The baby after 5 months he or she is alive, so the baby has rights too.
Late-term abortions occur bc of catastrophic birth defects or bc of risk to a woman's health. #StopLying #RightWingPropaganda
If this is how we’re going to judge what we do, we should also have universal healthcare, major gun controls, and believe in global warming.
What a dumb arguement
If you're pro-life you shld be demanding #gunlegislation & healthcare coverage, instead of supporting no gun control & repealing healthcare
You forgot to mention Canada and the Netherlands.
Because the #idiots @BarackObama @JustinTrudeau wanted to do this >>> https://twitter.com/KnowJesusKnow/status/674336092825456641 …

I'm sure that @realDonaldTrump will take #USA out of this list soon.
@FLOTUS should be more active in doing so.
@GaetaSusan @Juliet777777 
Why are we in the club with them condoning killing homosexuals?
60,000,000 babies killed and counting. Over 3,000 will die today.
Is there an exception for elected official's mistresses? Just wondering if any law applies to you guys or is it just the people who elect u?
The western world allows abortions after 5 mo due to fetal anomalies. The new draconian house bill allows no such exception. #probirth
This list isn't correct. In UK it's 24 weeks which is more than 5 months & they'll even do it on a 12 yr child.
#FakeChristians
Hi Rep. Trent Franks. I’m a researcher and abortion provider. This isn’t actual science. I’d be happy to educate you about it if you’d like. https://twitter.com/RepTrentFranks/status/914889566825385985 …
So we wanna be in the club with Sierra Leone and the Congo?
The weaponless invasion of America via Islam fits. We are killing our young and Islam is growing at a faster rate. Wake up America.
Im Canadian thanks
Shameful and abominable that the USA allows the slaughter of the unborn.
So you're using the hashtag #TheyFeelPain? Have a source for that, or is it made up bullshit for an arbitrary date? http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/local/scisoc/brownbag/brownbag0506/fetalpain.pdf …
What does "elective" mean in this context? The UK abortion laws effectively (if not officially) allow elective abortion up to 24 weeks.
The United States Senate, where good bills go to die!! Election day 2018 cometh!! @SenateMajLdr  @realDonaldTrump
You care about fetuses, but not children (CHIP), you’re in bed with the NRA and pro death penalty. This is not pro life! #GOPIsBadForPeople
Not your decision to make!!! When will we start regulating sperm? All that lost potential life with every ejaculation. #GOPIsBadForPeople
And then there's Israel:
@JohnCornyn have you looked at infant mortality rates in the US as compared to other countries?
Why did we leave the Paris Accord?
USA voted No alongside ...Bangladash, China, India, Iraq, Japan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia on UN resolution against death penalty. Not pro life
And think. Hillary Clinton wanted to pass a law making it legal for a full term abortion.
Yea right
This a sin
GOD is watching
Someday all will know what GOD thought of abortion 
This breaks my heart.  America in the same category as these???
Why do you allow the NRA to continue with this madness?
Leave the medical decisions to actual doctors.
Some patients need an abortion post-20-weeks due to the fetus having a lethal anomaly. HR 36 means they’ll have to carry the fetus to term.
I agree all life is precious.  So why don’t we have reasonable control on weapons to protect life?  We seem to be all alone in the gun club.
Surely you dont believe guns kill people.. oh wait u also believe spoons make people fat too.
Because Science. Most 20 week abortions are due to conditions incompatible with life. They were wanted pregnancies.
If you are going to base your bill on science, we should be using the best evidence, which indicates 26 weeks. http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/201429?hc_location=ufi …
Put up a graphic about countries whose ruling party does not believe in human-induced global warming.
Let's talk about the clubs we're in re:access to firearms
@Liz_Wheeler Because alls know their own kind, even liberals democrats,establishment republicanspoliticiansabout everything
Because there was is a lack of leadership in the Senate & Congress to put forth a Constitutional Amendment to make abortion illegal
Because FREEDOM!?
population control please
Because bodily autonomy is protected?
You hypocrite. Let's make women have babies, don't give them insurance to care for them, and then put guns in their hands to kill at will.
Because we have lost our moral compass
Unfortunately selling Baby parts is BIG MONEY and most people still don't know it.

Because for the most part, women of poor moral character can't keep their legs closed. From promiscuity to murder, it's all ok with them.
because liberals want us to be just like canada
Why not?
@KassyDillon is this true?
Dems still on control!!
Cause we have a stupid house and senate
Why do we allow elective abortions at all!?
Thank the dems for that 1.
You're welcome.
Cause democrats have been ruling for 8 years
Not sure about this. For example, UK has de facto abortion on demand up to 24 wks. That's their cut off pt. Disability abortions up to birth
because our cultural dialogue on this issue is grossly erroneous

as is the "substantive due process" caselaw of the Supreme Court
You put Vietnam on both lists
Sad .
Barak Hussein Obama had it right when he said we were no longer a Christian Nation. We still need to speak up and not be afraid !
He also supported the killing of babies...yes, babies...when they survived an abortion. He called them "botched medical procedures".
3-1/2-month-early Preemies have a 98% Survival Rate, after 6+ months on Life Support (abt $2,000 / day)! Abortion is MURDER!
Many women have been mislead to believe they're protecting themselves by protecting this "right". Punish doctors instead. They're educated.
Why do you want to be in a cub with Saudi, Congo and Pakistan?
Because otherwise you'd be in a club with Russia. Ew.
You won't see Kimmel crying over this murder!
Because our liberal politicians just love planned parenthood, no other reason.
It is utterly barbaric and uncivilized. So many pro choicers seem to think it is the "enlightened" position without slightest research.
That's because China and N. Korea are "Progressive!"
Just wish you all were as concerned with the starving and homeless children that are already here
A commonly retweeted myth. I worked as child advocate & big part of job was to find benefits/funding for poor families. Many sources.

Wow!  Shameful!
ABOLISH ABORTION
Don't want to be in this club, then fxxk off
Fair question.
Still not clear: You'd support abortions up to 4 months?  Or 3? And what punishments would you apply to doctors/patients that violate it?
Death penalty would be pretty ok.  
and don't forget Saudi Arabia for maternal deaths
