tax cuts for middle class, great healthcare for all with lower premiums, free ice cream at lunch, let me cast my vote right now for Rs.
Don't lie. You're giving pennies to the middle class- offset by gutting healthcare & public services- but millions for the Mnuchins & Kochs.
@stevenmnuchin1 got thrown under the bus yesterday, You're not keeping up Comrade Cornyn !! @txlege @tedcruz @JudgeJohnCarter @TXDemWomen 
That's what this guy does? Thought he had morphed into Rexxon/Fredo type promoting the Russian Cyber Security Unit. But that's so yesterday!
I can't believe I'm saying this, but @JohnCornyn is so much worse than even hot tub of feces @SenTedCruz
You don't have to repeat the headline, we can read it in the post. Try to have an original thought. #IfCornynOnlyHadABrain
and of course you realize thats the only promise keeping the stock market up-  You're gonna love the reaction when it crashes@TXDemWomen
Yeh, if it goes anything like your healthcare bill, we won't get real tax reform until we put the Democrats back in control of Congress.
Mr Corning are you helping get our President's agenda done?
@JoeMSNBC @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @GOP @RepKevinBrady @POTUS @realDonaldTrump  You mean those tax cuts to the top 1% !  2018 & 2020
And @realDonaldTrump still expects to go to Chuck E. Cheese's for his birthday. So what's your point?
How large will the accompanying cuts for the rich be and which services will you cut to fund them?
Nobody can trust you or any of the complicit ones enabling a Russian stooge. No shit.
Well Mnuchin is wrong
you need to define middle class. what about the wealthy? u are changing the brackets as well. Wt about SALT deduction?
Which middle class would that be? The over $200,000 a year class? Those of us in the 30,000 to 200,000 range are just effing out of luck.
What will be interesting is how much more of a tax cut the wealthy get?  4% for you, 10% for me. They are the "job creators" right?
John's ego has grown past his capabilities. Whether he runs or not depends on where the most $ is. He could be indicted and jail Trumpgate.
Yeah and yesterday @stevenmnuchin1 told us that the US-Russia cyber partnership was a great idea. Died about 6 hours later. #ZeroCredibility
I will let u keep my taxes w/o complaint. Just make single-payer healthcare available for all. And all reps have same HC as constituents.
John,for today's government lesson the Secretary of the Treasury can't do any legislation. We are at the mercy of Replutocrats like yourself
Let's just say that I, a middle-class taxpayer, am not holding my breath for any tax cuts that would benefit me.
And I expect a unicorn on my birthday.
I still expect my wife to satisfy me nightly. I also expect a in person town hall from my representatives . #cowardcornyn
Ya he also expected the Russian/US cyber security task force to be a thing too this morning soooo
You are still not KEEPING YOUR PROMISE, #FullRepeal of Obamacare we don't want your Better care shit. 

This morning, Steve Mnuchin told @ThisWeekABC US-Russia cybersecurity partnership was a "very significant accomplishment" for Pres. Trump. 
Idiot.
Thanks for moving the President's MAGA agenda forward. Texas will be proud of you and Ted if Obamacare is repealed and tax cuts passed!
No tax cuts for rich please. They don't pay their share anyway. To many exemptions!
You are responsible for gay marriage. You passed laws that taxed ppl differently based on whether they were married.. & ignored civil unions
Fact.  The overwhelming majority of any tax cuts will go to the wealthy.
The middle class has been eroded to a handful of people so this is an easy one to work out...
Not sure what u call middle class.
So #taxReform is just tax cuts? That's not reforming anything! The working man BETTER see relief! Flat taxes now! Payment based. Simple! 
Hey John. The leaders of your party are busy giving America to Putin. You think that Americans want to talk about your damn tax cuts? RESIGN
And what has historically happened after every tax cut, or trickle down economic attempt?  Do you not learn anything or blinded by hubris?
And he thought his most recent Tarzan movie was good.
Not if you can help it, eh John?
Mnuchin is not in Congress. You are. Do *you* expect tax cuts in 2017? How will you pay for them?
Aww, look at him. Bless his heart. Today he also said this b4 Trump stabbed him in the back w/a change of heart.
Sec. Mnuchin: Proposed US-Russia cybersecurity partnership a "very significant accomplishment" for Pres. Trump. http://abcn.ws/2sTTYbs  
Means u need to get it done, Senator.
Bahahaha.
We expect a repeal of Obamacare
Sure because he cares about us a much as you do Senator
Hidden behind massive business cuts that the 1% will leverage.

The GOP only care is the 1 % and Big business
On July 16 at 2PM, please join me at 1300 Lavaca St in Austin for a town hall meeting on proposed GOP cuts to Medicaid and health coverage
Yeah and a Democrat will come in again and clean up the Repubs financial mess again!  You guys never learn. Some old playbook.
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare #BCRA #AHCA #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
To be clear, Obamacare isn't failing. @realdonaldtrump is sabotaging it. 
Stop lying. Do you believe our IC community or Putin? #TrumpRussia #25thAmendmentNow #25thAmendment
Putin: We didn't meddle, ask Trump.
Reporter: But WH hasn't released any info.
Putin laughs: We'll talk to the WH and tell them to fix that. 
BullShit!Â© John. You will do ANYTHING to bleed the middle class to enrich your 0.1% buddies
NHL shut, Cornyn! You know what will be proposed is tax cut for wealthy like you who have no regard for the middle class, you're pathetic
More lies
