@netanyahu is charting a course for Israel as a Republican cause and not an American ally.
@nopretensehere @netanyahu Israel is the only country in the entire MENA where people actually love America. Why treat them this way?
.@friendsofbibi @nopretensehere @netanyahu We're not going to war b/c #Isreal wants us to. They don't like it? Send back our aid $$.
@SouthernRock3 @nopretensehere @netanyahu Israel is trying to prevent war. You don't avoid war with maniac mullahs through appeasement
@netanyahu Thank you for telling Congress and the rest of us what our leader can't seen to do on his own!
@netanyahu @ShackGeneral The only way to stop Iran is to bomb the hell out if them
@netanyahu you are interfering with our foreign policy, trying to bring us to war.  Israel is becoming a Republican cause instead of US ally
@nopretensehere @netanyahu Bet you drink four glass at least of pink lemonade kool aid a day.
@ReporterGreen @netanyahu Huh?  Did you experience a stroke in the middle of typing that.
@netanyahu @_HankRearden Your Nation is exposed & believe you must attack Iran for your survival Nukes in the hands of Iran is insanity

Anyone who announces pride over skipping @netanyahu's Iran speech is wallowing in hubris and willful ignorance. "I don't wanna hear truth!"
@botticellicream Let's be real. They're skipping @netanyahu's speech because loyalty to their bigoted president trumps hearing the truth.
