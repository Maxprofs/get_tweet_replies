Exaggerate much?
Can't wait to see her private schools teaching religion with my tax money.

Breitbarts answer, a white supremist group, fake news ! Embarrassing
Except @realDonaldTrump didn't win the popular vote so you're wrong. FAKE NEWS! Sad. Just sad.
He hasn't been paying attention.
I have

In My 70 YEARS I HaveNEVER SEEN THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS ATTACKED SO BLATANTLY.I FEEL LIKE HITLER HAS JUST TAKEN REIGNS

Question, has Inhofe had his Eyes Sight & Glasses Checked n the last 30yrs?
Yeah, but that guy's a bonehead!  Where'd his snowball go?
PENiCE!!!
Zieg heil!
Big Problem!
Remember you're attached to the "press" when he comes for you....
We are so happy with this powerhouse Administration!
Inhofe just got lasik, of course you would conveniently omit this.
Throwing reporters out of a press conference for trying to ask questions!!??? You are NO American! Disgusting! 
Oh Look a circle jerk of Imbeciles Say Hi to Sen. Snowball . Like the snowball #FakePresident

back off Inhofe! She's spoken for!
.@seanspicer oh sure.  Her family gives millions to reelect that damn traitor turtle again and again and again while Kentucky starves.
I doubt he can remember 10 minutes ago considering how much of a reckless moron he is.
Aww. Two sweethearts licking each other's butts.
what a pile of bs.
Jim Inhofe also doesn't believe in climate change, so he clearly hasn't paid much attention in the last 30 years.
didn't a ship owned by her father get caught with crazy mounts of cocaine? Crooks!!!
inhofe is an idiot!
did you threaten to kick out a reporter for asking questions at a press conference ?
He has the lowest approval ratings of any president elect in the history of polling, but sure, OK Sean.
Guess you didn't ask those that worked under her at Labor. They feel otherwise. Just saying.
Freedom of press!!!!!! How dare you violate our constitution!
- at least disclose that Elaine Chao is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
- your actions were very dictatoresque today. I thought you supported liberty and freedom as opposed to tyranny.
(and banning reporters)
you looked like you were about to shit yourself up there.
Sorry for unfollowing, @seanspicer
Don't be sorry.
Only tyrants threaten to throw a free press out. Mark Twain said it: "Don't pick a fight with people who buy ink by the barrel.
McConnell's wife. Why didn't McConell tell us about Trump's being compromised AND Golden Showers??
Is this true?
UPDATE: @CNN's Jim @Acosta says Donald Trump's incoming press secretary told him he'd be thrown out if he tried again to ask a question.
Have you seen his approval ratings, cowarddumbfuck?
Threatening to throw out reporter, comrade?  We will leave another cookie on your pillow -  Love, Moscow
you are a meanie 
Please, DM this to Mr. PE Trump

#urinesane
The people DO care about #TrumpTaxes
"Only ones who care about my tax returns are the reporters."

Retweet this if you're not a reporter, but you care about Trump's tax returns.
I think that particular rude CNN reporter should be barred from future news conferences.
I think you should be thrown out of the window.
You're a coward.
saw you today at whatever you want to call it. You angry, bro?
Disgusting that a reporter would have been thrown out of press conference. Free press is important to our country.
The people pity her for who she has to sleep with.
#FillingTheSwamp
Hilarious!!!
That wasn't a "news conference" it was a PR Campaign! @realDonaldTrump didn't really "answer the questions" put 2 him! #Corrupt
You may want to ask the Sago Miners about that.. Oh wait. Remember she cut 1/2 of the miner regulations right before then
Finally proud of my president and proud to be an American 
Wow, how sad. He's mentally ill, hates the Constitution, disrespects all Americans...but you're proud?
You're convictions are strong and I can appreciate them. As an American we're the fabric of what makes us so awesome and free to live in USA
.@seanspicer unlike @realDonaldTrump who has the abysmal approval rating of 37%  Terribly Sad!
Sucking up to boss' wife.
