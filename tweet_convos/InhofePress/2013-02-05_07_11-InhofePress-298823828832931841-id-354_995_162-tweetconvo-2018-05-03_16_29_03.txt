@brithume oh, i didn't realize the president was a lawmaker? did you graduate high school?
What do you mean? You know POTUS is required by law to submit a budget, yes? What does high school have to do here? @billiegirltoo @brithume
@WRogersM IS THAT arguable?
Is what arguable? @billiegirltoo
@WRogersM okay, if ppl are actually questioning SKEET SHOOTING, how will a budget in any way satisfy? congress is BROKEN
POTUS who can't get their way frequently blame Congress. A sign of weakness, btw. Effective POTUSs get as much as they can. @billiegirltoo
@WRogersM okay, that's just delusional
Facts please. Otherwise, that's an ad hominem attack. @billiegirltoo
@brithume @marthamaccallum can't do it all by himself!  Don't even get me started on the stubborn non compromising GOP (I'm an independent)
@dwgat2011 @marthamaccallum Submitting a budget is a legal requirement which previous presidents have routinely done.
@brithume @marthamaccallum yaBut usually cong and sen actually do something Brit.This cong/sen should be ashamed.How can any1 call that work
Trick question: it's not. When leaders obey the law only when convenient, we are no longer ruled by law. Impeachable?  @brithume
@brithume It is NOT ok.
Great minds think alike, @HarrietBaldwin. My response begins: "Trick question: it's not." :-) @brithume
@brithume Why Is Prez OBama not required to uphold the Constitution of the United States
@brithume the rules are changing daily right before our very eyes! And the masses don't care!
@brithume Good for you Mr. Hume! I don't feel the President cares what he is really suppose to do. More important he has a Socialist Agenda.
@brithume President Obama is the media darling and he also counted to infinity 4x's and back! No accountability anymore!
@brithume There has not been a budget since Obama took office in 2008. This way he and the Dems can continue their irresponsible spending!
@brithume because no one will hold him accountable. How is it possible he was not around while 4 died in #Benghazi?
@brithume R you saying a President should be faithfully executed for missing the legal deadline. Conflict: Between execution and dead line?
@brithume @rmack2x  Times four!
@brithume  can he b impeached 4 lack of leadership,more concerned 4 people that aren't Americans,(immigration)and phony gun laws?skeet &golf
@brithume PRIDE!
@brithume Why aren't you guys talking about all the ammo the government is buying up? We need answers
@brithume  He is counting on us Tax PAYERS to Give more of OUR HARD EARNED MONEY to Blow it. A budget would show where he plans to Blow it
@brithume Obama firmly believes that the law only applies to others.
@brithume #Bushfault
@brithume Since when has legality ever mattered to this President?
@brithume Well Brit we all know he is not presidential material, and after he has lived under a rock so long he do not know his figers 2well
@brithume 3 words - LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY! #tcot #RedNationRising #tlot #UniteBlue
@brithume Because he's a law onto himself until the GOP starts telling him no & backing it up with actions not compromises
@brithume Or run guns, or ignore immigration laws, voter intimidation laws, et al.
@brithume
@brithume A Presidents job: Uphold the Constitution.  Why is Obama so intent on dismantling the 2nd Amendment?
@brithume Or for no one to enforce the law?
@brithume Because Obama is an Illegal President that Supreme Court and Congress has Not Impeached an Continues mock Constitution
@brithume Because he's "eye candy" and not much else.
@brithume Who says it is?  Why hasn't the House started legal proceedings againt the Administration? None of them r doing their job.
@brithume WHY do we allow the SENATE to not approve/submit a budget in 4 yrs?? WHAT IS BEHIND SENATOR REID'S NOT PROVIDING a BUDGET'? WHY?
@brithume - he is re-writing the constitution into his vision of a "communist manifesto" abolish due process, abolish 1 and 2nd amendment...
@brithume Why is ok 4 a pres 2b sworn-in when U know he is ineligible,why is it ok not 2 make BHO prove he is eligible 2b pres..never vetted
@brithume It isn't ok but just in case u missed it it is ok for obama to do what he damn well pleases ie Benghazi!
@brithume Come On Brit, since when does OBAMA gives a Rat'sASS, he likes to Rule like Castro, Chavez, and all other Dictators via EXECorders
@brithume Obama will keep getting away with murder, literally; while nobody actually sees enforcing the law instead of just mentioning it
@brithume US royalty is exempt from US law
@brithume didn't you get the memo, Brit? Obama is above he law! Laws and the constitution were discarded on January 20, 2009!
@brithume It is not o.k....he expects us to pay our taxes on time or he comes after us through the IRS.  Why is he exempt for any deadlines.
@brithume Didn't someone tell you the "rules" don't apply to all sides equally? This Pres believes he's exempt. Doing it for our own good.
@brithume etc, etc. and that's only a start!
@brithume Because he 's the King Brit! America gave up its Republic 5yrs ago & we won't get it back until he's gone
@brithume Because laws are only for the people. He is a MUCH higher authority and, like a God, knows when man's laws are just folly.
@brithume Whatabout immigration laws? Obama demands the Police not carry out the law. So, he violates the law. #tcot
@brithume Sir,I`ve always seen you as a"fair&bal." reporter.But don`t you think it`s time to take a side?right now America needs Patriots!
@brithume Because this president doesn't think rules apply to him. He is the King.
@brithume Because Brit if you disagree with him you could be labelled, and  we are talking drones baby! My guess people get nervous!
@brithume shat, pass the paper (clue... it's printed on parchment) so he uses his left hand like a goodson of Ishmael
@brithume Not for the last 4 years!  we all have to live or die with his decisions economically!  Pass a budget NOW not another declaration
@brithume because he thinks he is King.
@brithume Because his slobbering toadies in the "news" media, along with his GOP enablers, let him skate by.

@brithume It's just one more example of his thinking that he's above the law.
.@brithume  bigger question is why is POTUS distancing himself frm #Benghazi 
@gretawire @foxnewspolitics 
FOXONTHERUN
@michellemalkin
@brithume It might B argued that a timely budget is a duty of the office thus failure 2 provide one violates the oath 2 faithfully execute.
@brithume Talk is cheap!
@brithume Obama's deceptions R many. However, his oath was 2 faithfully execute "the office" not "the laws".
@brithume Kind of a softball question for a socialist/marxist president, don't you think Brit?
@brithume We have learned 1 thing from the Revenge King....He thinks he is Above the Law
@brithume Answer: It is not OK, but this is a lawless president.
@TamaraBatesRhod @brithume And a lawless Senate (Dems). I say the House, too, because they just roll over every time. Lily-livered rats.
@BatesBE @brithume The only answer I see is passing amendments to term limit them. They are more concerned about holding onto power.
@TamaraBatesRhod @brithume Also repeal the 17th, no chance in the Senate. Too many citizens are brain-dead. For now. Until #HitRockBottom
@brithume What president?  he is the democrat's king............We are mere peons
@brithume it's not OK! so what can be done about it? How about not letting him get away with it like a spoiled kid?
@brithume @FiestaBuckeye It is not ok. Sociopaths know right from wrong. However, they don't believe it applies to them.
@brithume it isn't ok and there is where accountability for Rule of Law should begin.#rosies4usa
@brithume 
Ahhhhh, after 4 years of seeing who this terrorist is, do you consider that a serious query?
@brithume  Because Muslims take pride in Taqqiya.  In other words, Owebama is the terrorist in the WH. Laws and constitution don't apply
@brithume Why does he & Congress/Senate refuse to uphold the Constitution as they have taken an oath to do, under God? #Impeachthemall #tcot
@brithume there should be a late penalty like when i don't file my taxes on time
@brithume Why is he doing ne thng that doesn't make sense.  He's doing e'thing he can to c'fuse our original beliefs about our country.
@brithume @treasure_pug1 he set the tone in his first year, ignore enforcing laws he doesn't like, write EO's for laws he wants etc.
@brithume It's not okay for the President to break the laws he swore to uphold...I call for the #Impeachment process to begin..
@brithume @dividendmaster why is the Fed allowed to counterfeit our currency and allow/finance budget deficits ad infinitum?
@st0cksniper @brithume Because thats what the EBT/foodstamps/Obamaphones public demands and politicians need to give away to buy votes
@brithume why are entitlements "untouchable" by law?  What binds the Congress to obey laws given the President's example?
@brithume He quickly learned that no matter what he does or does not do, nothing happens. I've never seen anything like it, or him. Lawless.
@brithume. DONT forget HE CAN WALK ON WATER & Is above the laws. HE MAKES HIS OWN RULES.
@brithume Since BO's broken law if budget submission 4 times.  What us his penalty?
@brithume It isn't OK.
@brithume America does not have a spending problem, it has a president problem. #amabozo
@brithume It's unpatriotic and arrogant.  He assumes the Constitution etc.. don't apply to him and that's scary.
@brithume Sssh! He IS black you know.
@brithume Why does that man get away with everything he does? He breaks the law & lies everyday he breathes.
@brithume That's the Change part.
@brithume Making a mockery of the rule of law is an all consuming endeavor. So, the President is extremely busy.
@brithume he is above the law like past dictators
@brithume because he's a human being, and nobodys perfect? I bet its hard to draft a budget. Lots of parties want their say.
@brithume Exactly!!  Why isn't anyone (House?) trying to charge Obama and Reid for breaking laws re budgets???
@brithume or to tell the law officers not to enforce illegal immigration laws.
@brithume He tried to blame it on Barney, GW Bush's dog.
@brithume Because he's above the law, of course!
@brithume He THINKS that he's above the law! His arrogance flows like his narcissism.
@brithume It isn't OK but he has his own agenda & running the country isn't it.He is globalist empty suit & not businessman, statesman,
@brithume not just once but 4 times in 5 years. That's just a slap in the face. We should charge him penalties, just like the IRS does to us
@brithume Obama thinks he's above the law and his reelection confirmed that in his mind. He violates constitution, gets away with it.
@brithume It is an outright embarrassment to honest Dems who want to see the deficeit fixed. It also makes it harder to blame GOP.
@brithume Because he is above the law, dontcha know? #FailedPOTUS
@brithume It isn't, but we do not have ANYONE to step up and do the right thing..They dont want to be called "racist" PATHETIC .
@brithume Some1 ought 2 remind Barry tht post $500B in Miltary Budget cuts has cause everything he stated in his Presser Slowed economy…Jobs
@brithume Barry's too smart to keep within confides of Law…? is Wheres the media on this & His license 2 kill & isn't X Media stop Madness ?
@brithume Because The Republican RINO Control Congress are busy handing out voter registration cards to illegal alien & asking for donations
@brithume there is no end to the things he gets away with.america is to GREAT to let one person escape our laws.
@brithume do we have a bully in the bully pulpit? does the sun shine?  Dare we call government overspending the spade (not just spending)?
.@brithume Whay aren't people of influence like yourself recommending Congress hold this president accountable to our laws? That's their job
@brithume If President Obana  submitted budgets, they would have to disclose what they woud intend ro spend the tapayrs money on,
@brithume Obama views the law as something to be bent, twisted and an obstacle to get around, instead of the foundation for a society.
@brithume He did not take the oath to support the constitution!  read between the lines, Mr. Hume. Get your rino b out of the DC cesspool.
@brithume communism has no need to budget because in #FairyTaleLand all the wonderful, fair minded people share everything equally.
@brithume OH R PRES is a STAR? in the eyes of the TAKERS He can DO NO WRONG? BAD THOUGHT SHOWS NO GOVERNING POWER WE R THE LOSERS I C DO U?
@brithume Because the Vox Populi (press) has summarily let us down and allows it. Simple.
@brithume You know how you tell a 3 year old to stop talking & go to sleep? That's pretty much it.
@brithume Because he can.  Congress doesn't care. Press doesn't care. People don't care. What's next.
@brithume Congress hasn't acted either i.e, Fulfilling constitutionally sworn & legally binding duties as C.I.C. & P.O.T.U.S. #USMCJ #SCOTUS
@brithume Obama is getting away with murder & congress does nothing to stop this fake INELIGIBLE POTUS!
@brithume Why is it OK for the Opposition to dick around and NOT face the same obligation?
@brithume It isn't OK. In fact, it's not even legal but O is protected by the media. Were he a Republican, he'd be impeached by now!
@brithume Why does he make up rules as he sees fit,and ignore laws he doesn't like? Exempting cronies from obamacare,no protection of rights
"@brithume" Because he has not been accountable to anyone, and Congress has not been accountable to us, the people who elected them!
@brithume Not OK, but heard Reagan had done it b4, not sure about extenuating circumstances at that time... #budget
Because King O runs this country like an emperor. Hello. Wake up America. @brithume @brithume @LeaDannewitz
Because his Justice Dept is trying to skirt laws to faithfully execute American citizens with drones. @brithume
@brithume Because the media doesn't call him on it. Thankful for Fox News.
because Obama considers our laws only a suggestion! @brithume @jojoaruba52
@brithume 
Mr. Hume,
Who said it so ok?
It is not ok.
@brithume: 'Cause The #Budget is supposed to originate in The House of Reps; said law un-Constitutional,  violates "Separation of Powers"!
@brithume cuz he's a Democrat #noaccountability
@brithume Hes killing people. It puts lack of budget into perspective for me.
@brithume Too busy running an extrajudicial drone assassination program, clearly.
@brithume 4 year precedent that's why. How about some accountability.
@brithume It's not OK. But the Dems control the Senate and are not calling him out on it, and the media largely ignores lack of Obama budget
@brithume because he's the HNIC.  DM me if you don't know what that is.
@brithume OBAMA IGNORES LAES BC NO1 will call him on it! MSM is criminally corrupt, GOP's been castrated &dems have no regard 4constitution!
@brithume When you are an Excellency, you can take your time. Doesn't matter that he is not wearing any clothes. History will overtake him.
@brithume 

Probably became ok when he began not following immigration laws and went from there
.@brithume I hope ur not so naive to think he gives a shit about our laws or what's right for America. He's V.I.Lenin!
#TGDN #tcot #LNYHBT
@brithume Obama and the law? LOL!!! Good one, Brit!!
@brithume Don't worry. It's imminent.
@brithume because NO ONE is stopping him!
@brithume Because the MSM doesn't consider it newsworthy, Politicians r 2 divided, & the public has no voice
@brithume And he has done this how many times now?  Five?!
@brithume Ultimately the Supreme Court will wind up determining if Obama's actions and inactions are illegal. The House must be forceful!
@brithume I give up...WHY?
@brithume Obama has ignored letter of the law (unless it fits his needs) since his 1st day in office! Why is he allowed 2 get away with it?
.@brithume He was too busy skeet droning.
@brithume Silly conservative! Meaning is for kids! In Progland its Humpty Dumpty Time "Words mean what I say they mean."
@maxnrgmike @brithume Orwell: hx of intentional destruction of language,societies accepted method of communication as primary control agent
@brithume because there are never any repercussions to these irresponsible actions.
@brithume Because he's black & whites are wimps
@brithume   @deblessings   he's a failure of epic proportions  someone needs to put his ass in a corner on a major time out #ActsLikeAChild
@brithume He was not CREATED to OBEY laws!   His duty was to fulfill THEIR Agenda even when it meant circumventing/ignoring/by-passing them!
@brithume Where ya been, Brit? He's above the law in his mind
@brithume IMPEACH HIM. The House has the power but no BALLS.
@brithume same reason it's ok he gets away with everything he's doing, there are no longer 3 branches of govt
@brithume /He misses deadline cause it doesn't fit in his agenda. It's clear, with BO it's all about spending. This president is pathetic.
@brithume AMEN!
Because our POS POTUS is a liar and he had no intentions of keeping his oath.  @brithume
@brithume because while it's against the law, the law provides no penalty.
@brithume Because he's Special!!
@brithume Simple!  It's not!!!
@brithume because all of DC think they r above the law taxing w/o representing us again
@brithume He is prez doesn't apply to him Have you read the Bible on which he swore? Only had pages he edited
@brithume His neglect only affects three hundred million americans
@brithume He's not the president, Mr. Hume. He's the King.
@brithume Brit, I watch you every day. I'm finally excited that you are trying to be more Conservative. Take notes from @JudgeJeanine
.@brithume definition of epic fail... has BO ever met a single deadline since in office? He is beyond incompetent
Sovereigns held accountable by no one needent bother with competence. MT He is beyond incompetent @suscitate @brithume
@brithume OBAMA sets a bad example for our children? HE'S A DISGRACE, breaking laws, snubbing & overriding OUR Constitution. IMPEACH
@brithume it's not
@brithume Because he's too busy givin away free stuff for votes to his party. A budget would put a kink in that chain.
@brithume It's not. But there is no adult supervision in Washington. Rarely has been in Congress, but 1600 is unusually cavalier
#GolfPants
@brithume He's a Democrat.  Duh.  Laws don't apply to them.
@brithume it is only when good men stand with all they have against the wrong makes it not ok! House needs to cut off monies until budget!
@brithume good question. now as a good reporter, dig that answer up for us please. @ClearLakeTP @PearlandTEA #foxnewsisfallingdownonjob
@brithume Because he's a pathological LIAR, silly!
