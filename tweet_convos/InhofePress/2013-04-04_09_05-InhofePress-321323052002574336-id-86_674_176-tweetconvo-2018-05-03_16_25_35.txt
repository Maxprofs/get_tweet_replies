@SenMikeLee amen Senator!!! #mikelee
@SenMikeLee God bless you sir for being one of a handful in that moral cesspool, Congress, that still reveres our Constituiton.
@SenMikeLee Looking forward to the Filibuster Thursday. I hope I have power :)
@SenMikeLee The line in the Sand has been drawn on this 2ndAmendment attack #StandWithRand + #PrimaryAllRinos who vote Dem. on #GunGrab #NRA
Can we trade for Sen. Lee? MT @SenMikeLee: ...The right to bear arms isn't about the arms, it's about the right:
@SenMikeLee EVERY Amend has limits! People hunted deer with bows/arrows for centuries. No one needs dozens of guns+thousands of bullets
MT @SenMikeLee: #Guncontrol isn't about guns, it's about control.
@SenMikeLee Constitutional Amendment is the only LEGAL way to pass gun restrictions. So why is the senate breaking the law and their oath?
@SenMikeLee No is not about the right its about reasonable restrictions already in every state NO FILIBUSTER http://acardworld.psend.com/cgi/polit.cgi?6 
@SenMikeLee  Kiss children, not guns.
How dare people think gun nuts can't have children for target practice, @SenMikeLee says. Tyrants demand we kiss guns; where are patriots?
@SenMikeLee thank you 4 speaking truth.Our rights are to be protected. Only a constitutional convention can change these rights
NOT CONGRESS
SANITY.. TY @SenMikeLee #Guncontrol isn't about guns, it's about control. The right to bear arms isn't about the arms, it's about the right.
@SenMikeLee there needs 2 be control & enforce the laws on the books. Parole shouldn't be an option for some criminals
@SenMikeLee I stand with you @SenTedCruz & @SenRandPaul and anyone else that stands for the #2A and our #Constitution
@SenMikeLee it's getting out of control senator. DHS,TSA,ATF all agencies. Nothing left in 4yrs if u don't start bringing this to forefront
@SenMikeLee God bless you Mike Lee
.@SenMikeLee So what r your thoughts on @SenToomey proposal?
@SenMikeLee Thank you for being a Principled Conservative. Tomorrow will again show us if there are any others. #tcot #nra #haction #2ndA
@SenMikeLee Amen!
@SenMikeLee dead bang on. No pun intended
@SenMikeLee Amen!
@SenMikeLee No Guns for Jews, Part One: http://youtu.be/4H-qOUmCrIU  via @youtube Please view Part One thru Five. More reasons to keep 2A intact.
@SenMikeLee Uh?
@SenMikeLee Thank you, Sen. Lee!
@SenMikeLee Yes, controlling the mentally unstable from getting guns. Remember, it's people who kill people. #DEMANDACTION VOTE!
@SenMikeLee It is violence control and gun safety.  We must put a stop to the slaughter.
@SenMikeLee Only if your a jerk taking gun lobby money or listening to a bunch of rednecks who are building bunkers in the back yard.
@SenMikeLee quit distracting, no one wants to get rid of the 2nd amendment. 90% of America does want universal background checks though.
! @SenMikeLee 700 Retired Military Special Ops Tell Congress 2 Form Select Committee on Benghazi http://shar.es/dUNAs  via @BreitbartNews
@SenMikeLee justify "the right to bear arms" in today's society. Justify fillibustering a bill you haven't even read. Real answers please.
@SenMikeLee Yep! Shouldn't take long for thinking ppl to figure this out.
@SenMikeLee We have a government that can't control itself, yet wants to control us. The constitution says it's to be the opposite.
@SenMikeLee You say it so well!  Thanks. Go Mike Lee!
@SenMikeLee #Guns are about how they make the owners feel about themselves. It doesnt justify the mayhem anymore http://nyr.kr/17htVr2 
@SenMikeLee And the new info about the Colorado Shooter and how the mental health system failed to inform the police is the problem. !!
@SenMikeLee Tell that to the parents of the Newtown massacre
@SenMikeLee Good luck with the filibuster! P.S. The Scalia reference just means that he wasn't declaring ALL gun laws unconstititutional.
@SenMikeLee -#Guncontrol isn't about guns, it's about control,<< Right on target... Obamacare wasn't abt healthcare but was abt CONTROL too
@SenMikeLee --every dictator in history started registry then confiscation--saying BO won't is plain stupid-never give anyone the authority
@SenMikeLee Amen to that #P_C_L
@SenMikeLee Hooah!  Thank you! http://youtu.be/arr2vJdKHlU   A Utah Cowboy thoughts from the Drop Zone
@SenMikeLee couldnt have said it better my self #2ndammendment
@SenMikeLee California is planning to register bullets and demand a fee to own them. How do we stop this? Think *their* Voter ID arguments
@SenMikeLee Please Hold  to your Honor. To many Senators have sold theirs.Thanks for being Constitutional Friendly. #IsatandWithRandLeeCruz
@SenMikeLee Saw a great bumper sticker today in WI: "The only gun control I believe in is my trigger finger"
@SenMikeLee agreeded an expanded back ground checks r really expanded invasion of r privacy
@SenMikeLee Well said!
@SenMikeLee D of Homeland Security uses national database 2 verify identity 4 drivers license, use same for guns! Database already reality.
It's about people being murdered & you needing to get off your ass & do something. Are you really pro-life? Then regulate guns.
@SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee Our complaints aren't about semantics, they're about people dying.
@SenMikeLee thank you Senator
@SenMikeLee #demandaction Ultimately, you are more concerned about the right of felons to get guns easily than the lives of constituents.
@SenMikeLee #demandaction 40% of gun sales are completely unregulated, we don't even know how many felons and other ineligibles are buying.
@SenMikeLee #demandaction The same old tired arguments.  Universal background checks and post-conviction follow-up have worked well in CA.
@SenMikeLee its about commies in power taking our freedoms.
@SenMikeLee I have yet to know of a gun, all alone, spontaneously fire. Intent is issue. Not guns. Hard for them to understand? #dumbDems
@SenMikeLee Finally Someone in D.C. that Speaks the Truth rather than Political Correctness!
@SenMikeLee
Bravo.
.@SenMikeLee and your op-ed isn't about solving a problem. It's a poorly written, fear-mongering, appeal to the far-right, re obstructionism
@SenMikeLee So true.
@SenMikeLee Background Checks are about checking.  It's the person not the gun.  Background checks check the person...not the gun.
@SenMikeLee Anyone who thinks GUNS don't require any measure of CONTROL is deluding themselves.
@SenMikeLee - AMEN Senator! Keep up the good work and thank you for supporting our rights!
@SenMikeLee Total gun registration will lead down a road to total gun confiscation by those keepimg the records. 2nd am't is to protect us .
@SenMikeLee Right on. Seems like just about every policy or rule being thrown out there these days is ONLY about control.
