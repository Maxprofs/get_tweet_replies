Integrity and politics can not continue to be polar opposites!
God is Good Trump needs to get it together we must keep Praying
Tell them only Dems should act that way.
We woken up
Exactly.We feel helpless unable to do anything.Electoral college needs be abolished. We did not vote for this. Gerrymandering,voter suppress
Lol Ibanacare was done in secret too! Not one Repub vote rammed down our throats Told to pass to find out what's in it!! Trump asked Dems>
2work with Repub but they're just interested in agenda failing even if fails in process! #MAGA FYIFinallydoing great economically again
We already have 'The Alinsky Care Act,' what more could you ask for?
I was wide awake and PRAYING it wouldn't pass.

"Trumpcare"a misnomer, "trump doesn't care" would be more appropriate!
Thank you for caring and helping.
Yes, we were awake and actively tweeting. Thank you!

Why shouldn't we be asleep. Dems have been for 8 yrs, only thing they managed to accomplish will probably bankrupt this country in a few yrs

@SenateMajLdr @SenJohnMcCain   @LindseyGrahamSC  We are awake and watching for vote in Senate. Do not vote yes unless House will go to conf.
Ryan is untrustworthy. They know it's wrong, they need to vote NO and take it on again w hearings and committee meetings. Not this way!
Are they completely insane??
#wideawake Google rep on radio reported BLUE STATES searches related to politics - RED STATES? Usual: entertainment and ... Not news.
I wasn't, but my Senators, Warner and Kaine, were. Job done.
I did not love my time in NM, but I appreciate you.
Been UP all night! The anxiety of watching this is only going to cause a spiral effect and make the sick even sicker! Their goal is to KILL!
I am WIDE AWAKE ANDI will remember this in 2018 and 2020

We are WIDE awake and will remember their names if this passes, so we can bring them down in 2018 and 2020.
For something this important, everyone needs time to read it carefully. Not a surprise rushed blind vote.
The dirtiest group of backdoor thieves!! They are literally thieves in the night!
I know people that will die because of that law they just past. I feel like America has become a concentration camp.
@SenateGOP I'm glued to the TV watching a bunch of uncaring hateful so-called GOP politicians bound & determined to hurt their constituents.
The Motion to send the "Skinny" bill to Health, Education, Pension & Labor committees just failed 52-48. A loss for McConnell.
@CrypticPhilDz These motherfuckers are shameless. #GOPDeathMachine #ShameShameShame
We are SO awake and angry as hell.

So you can't read 8 pages quickly? Probably because your a politician, ya know, los intelligence, professional liar. That sort of thing.

Awake. Watching.
We are very much awake and watching and hoping this bill does not pass. This will kill me.
Remember when the Senate passed the ACA on Christmas Eve?

Funny you say that...I remember a time when a bill called The affordable Care act was voted on in the middle of the night! #hypocrite
Give us the same plan congress has! Or have congress get on the plan they r trying to force on us!!!
Tonight is the beginning of the end of the GOP party.  You can't heartlessly and deliberately hurt people and expect to remain standing.
We r all awake and ready to jump on GOP
I'm half awake and dwindling. Wish I hadn't binge watched Ozark already.

Repubs spent a lot of time thinking up ways to try to fool everyone but not time to make a decent health care bill7. 7 yrs planning tax cuts
Have they directly replaced it with Obamacare or what improvement have they done to Trump care?
Been here all day, Tom, since 7am

DEMOCRAT PLAYBOOK lovin' it
#Trumpcare  Please disrupt this process in any way possible. Don't play by their rules - peacefully, of course.  The most vulnerable need u.
We want Obamacare repealed and replaced... you seem to forget that your party lost in 10, 14 and 16 on the promise to repeal and replace.
It's okay, the west coast can watch this one for the rest of the country.
Please retweet
I'm finding it difficult to look away from this massive train wreck in progress. What a nightmare for all Americans.
You think they care?
No no no no!!  This is not ok!!!!  Cowards!!!
Yep, good thing they had over a year of debate. 

50 million Trumpsters are up and watching this great Trump accomplishment. The Obamacare nightmare is going to B over & single payer is gone
Thanks for working so hard to defeat this crap. As a recent addition to New Mexico, makes me feel good about being here.
Man, I haven't slept since November.
I cannot sleep anymore
I won't be in bed for a while, Senator. I think I'm safe.
They want you to "Pass it to see whats in it"
How dare they use a democrat tactic.
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain @SenRonJohnson presser was Ruse to jam this thru. @HouseGOP made it auto vote. @POTUS will sign this in AM.
I am awake. And want the ACA repealed ASAP
Fixing the ACA is doable with bipartisan work. But congress would have to act like grownups for a change.
How is mandating citizens buy a private good fixable?
Light fire to your desk. Pull a fire alarm.  Kick over the podium. FUCKING SOMETHING. YOU ARE IN THE ROOM.
Wide a awake .
filibustering act in an obstructive manner in a legislature, especially by speaking at inordinate length.
I am wide awake and terrified about what you are callously doing to simple American lives @SenateGOP
VOTE no @senateGOP #ResistTrumpcare #SkinnyRepeal #trumpcare 16 million off insurance is too many

@catvalente And refreshing Twitter every few minutes, waiting to find out if I'll have health care coverage come morning
I would call you but you are against it.
Thank you for everything you have done to stop this.
@SenateGOP We ARE awaleWe ARE watching you
You need to tell people how to specifically react what can I do to show them were not asleep we more than a tweet directions guidance
REPUBLICANS TRYING TO KILL 181 THOUSAND VIETNAM VETERANS  Cowards
