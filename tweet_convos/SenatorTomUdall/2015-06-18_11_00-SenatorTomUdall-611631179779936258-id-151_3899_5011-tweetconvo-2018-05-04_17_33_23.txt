@Pontifex Yes. To become aware of our footstep in the world is to evaluate our actions much like we evaluate our conscience.
@Pontifex Pope Francis, I am sorry for the Rick Santorum statement. He is in denial
@Pontifex There won’t be many future generations unless you start telling people birth control is necessary.

@Pontifex @Juanjo3800
@Pontifex. What a remarkable Pope.  Never has my church been led with such charisma and open mindedness.  Pleased to be a catholic.
@Pontifex No disrespect meant but if humans are the cause of climate change/pollution why do you still oppose birth control?
@Pontifex Is telling as the antichrist head of that kind of Church which has killed 50 000 000 human at its life time.
