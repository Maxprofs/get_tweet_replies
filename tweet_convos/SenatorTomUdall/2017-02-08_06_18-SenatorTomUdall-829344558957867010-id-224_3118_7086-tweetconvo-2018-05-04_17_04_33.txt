@DebraMessing  SO!!!!! Like a spoiled baby.
we see the sexism
It's great to see them stand up, but we all knew Sessions would be voted in, just like Devos and the rest. 2018 will be a big vote
BO - RING!!! WE WANT TRUMP!!!
You've GOT Trump.  THAT is the problem!
@akeleven McConnell  did not want to challenge him.
perfect example of why America hates politicians. All they do is argue and get nothing done. We want Trumps cabinet to be filled!
I'll fix it for you... "filled with QUALIFIED, non racist, non sexist, misogynists". Is that too much to ask? #resist
HW and Clinton had their cabinets filled after this date. What's the rush?
ThAts incorrect. This is the slowest approval since George Washington.
Don't bash an ally for using their privilege to elevate the voices of women that were silenced.
no one is bashing! We're just not letting it slide that a female was silenced and a male wasn't.
My family is all different race.  Stop using the race card.  Get legal.  Muslims put down the guns.
Who give a damn other than the dumbacraps and lazy stay out of session. WHAT IS THE SORRY JOB, DO IT.
@educatorsresist @SenatorTomUdall you are a hero!!! Keep it up!!! #ResistFromDay1
thank goodness this was put into the record
So HE CAN USE SESSION's,NAME, BUT WARREN COULDN'T ? What a boatload of misogyny in the US Senate! #BULLSHIT
Mitch mcconnell and Diosdado Cabello different Ideologies same motives, equal methods
@SenatorTomUdall Thank you for reading the letter but it is very clear @SenWarren was silenced by @SenateMajLdr on her gender!
that's ok! It just proves our case further!
how many proves do you need before you take REAL action? @womensmarch ACT NOW
I am! I marched! I'm writing postcards! I'm on the school board, I'll vote. I'm on your side!!
I feel you...same as well & frustration to the masses is building and before we reach the brink WE need to find a bigger voice.
millions are awaiting on a leader to emerge to connect the will of the majority. We can't wait for elections. The movement NOW
we need @SenSanders @BarackObama to be that leader or Identify and placed in the spotlight.
They would have never silenced a man!
Where is your coverage of Sen. Tim Scotts response?
Why?????
Yes!!
Sessions was a racist pig then and now. That's why Trump, I mean Bannon, picked him. Make America white again.
BRAVO Senator Udall!
@MoElleithee surely you know it's not about the letter..Pocahontas continued her slander of Sessions.Dems using race/woman card
it's not a card, women and people of color exist! Respect existence or expect resistance!
You lose again.
enough already US senate if he is so bad convince your colleagues and vote!
Lost respect for the GOP. They are now acting like; 'monkey see, monkey do' and that is an insult to monkeys.
For years I felt bad because I stereo-typed, thought they were all mean-spirited. Don't feel bad anymore, they are
@SenatorTomUdall well done sir.

#StillShePersisted #LetTheImpeachmentBegin
Thank you Senator udall from nm. Our great blue state  for reading Coretta Scott king's letter
Thank you @SenatorTomUdall  Someone with courage to ensure Sessions's reputation as a racist is known!
@DebraMessing every democrat senator should read this on the senate floor. Drive McConnell bat shit crazy!
Were her name Edward Warren, McConnell would never have even tried to silence her.
Pick up your swords, shield maidens. It's time to kick some ass.
But not a woman, oh no how dare she.
Trumpanzees don't want healthcare jobs or education clean water they want to be ENTERTAINED are u not listening!!!
ATTA BOY UDALL  #NewMexicoTRUE
Perfect example why the Electoral College needs to be abolished.  Dems have the popular vote!  He speaks for the majority!
We will not be silenced Senator Mitch McConnell. PS: Steve Bannon is the actual president.
FAKE NEWS!!!!
Trump's cabinet should be confirmed already!
#everyDemSenShouldDoThis#ShePersisted#
Thank you so much for doing this. How did you get by without being silenced like @SenWarren?
@SenatorTomUdall thank you  #LetHerSpeak #letlizspeak
Whatever. LOLOL
we resist because we care about our democracy#stoptheRepublicans#whyImarch
yes! Thank you!! Thank you!! Thank you!!
Well the NAACP disagrees with Warren
Represent Mr.Udall!  Thank you for standing up to GOP Disgrace
I'm glad someone is finally doing their job, a job " We the people" elected them to do.....hats off to you Senator!!!
@TheDemocrats is this what Real Americans want? Childish, stubborn bullshit is not going 2B forgotten in 2018. Vote 4 Republicans.
great job I'm glad someone is doing a job that we elected you to do!!!! my hats off to you!!
way to go!!!
@StevenReyCristo 
@Translation_Is Every Single Democrat needs to #ReadTheFuckingLetter !
Thank you! @cbsnews @senatortomudall
@Tajalithaca WTF is this what legislative branch is now? #fireall535
| Yes!
@DeleHaynes I don't understand, the New Mexico Center can read the letter for Sen Warren can't because she was breaking the rules?
I reckon @SenateMajLdr violated #Rule19 when he impunged @SenWarren! She spoke truth, he prefers the Lie.
#SegregationNow
@SenatorCollins @SenAngusKing please oppose confirmation of Jeff Sessions.
lets skip to the. It's. sessions is in.
If a senator cannot question the fitness of another in confirmation process is impossible to have adequate hearing
in 2009, the NAACP awarded Sessions their “Governmental Award of Excellence.”  So quick they change their tune for political points
I am disgusted by this Trump regime in the White House, along with every other civilized human being in this country and the world.
@SenatorTomUdall proud to be a New Mexican, thank you Senator Udall!
@BonnieD87703006 So FINALLY we see some men growing balls trying to match ladies who've had courage to #Resist #Trump. Need more!!!
bravo Tom my senator
#letlizspeak Sexist Republicans' racism even has double standard! Male Sens can read King ltr but Warren can't. #WomensMarch
here goes the circus of Democrats, diversion professionals. Silence of Warren was due to her disdain for Jeff Sessions not King
@SenatorTomUdall Thank You Senator Udall for speaking for those of us who have had our voices silenced. #ShePersisted
Thank you, Senator Udall. You are standing up to the racism and proving the sexism that exists in our govt.
hell yes
You only tell women to shut up and sit down @SenateMajLdr #SenateVagLdr
@SenatorSessions @potus vote no on Sessions!!
democrats look stupid and bitter, not the way to win over a popularity contest. 2018 will purge the rest of these idiots.
so it is ok for a man to read a women's letter but @SenWarren gets punished for it. God this country just keeps showing itself
Good for him. But I noticed the Senate didn't cut him off or ban him from the rest of this debate.
@GreatDismal YES! Every dem senator should do this... let mitch rule 19 them all if he's got the stones
Thank you for reading the King letter on the senate floor.
why was he allowed Ellen @SenWarren wasn't?
GOP:  Let the white supremacist, Milo, speak!
GOP:  Be quiet #CorettaScottKing !
@SenWarren @SenJeffMerkley I'm reading her letter to all my classes today.#BlackHistoryMonth  #resist #ShePersisted
GO DEMOCRATS 2018..WERE TURNING OUT VOTE STRONG.IT WONT BE RIGGED THIS TIME
@blogdiva its a war on women. Shameful & disgust doesn't cover it.
Why weren't the men silenced?
Thank you for picking up the gauntlet, @SenatorTomUdall.
thank you Sen Tom Udall
#WomensRights threatened again.  was Udall allowed to speak and #ShePersisted wasn't? #sexistGOO
congratulations Senator Udall for standing tall and congratulations for senator Warren for trying to fo the same thing
@JulieMartinSVU Yeah New Mexico
not only was Warren "silenced", she was silenced "with prejudice". I haven't appreciated Elizabeth Warren nearly enough.
she like trump she breaks rules. Whats wrong with breaking some rules.
what's wrong with male senators reading same letter and no McConnell put-down?
I don't think there is anything g wrong with it.  They said she broke a rule. I'm saying just like trump breaking rules
3. "Cotton called a Senator "a cancer,"  no violation. But quote Coretta Scott King? GOP shut It down.
they said that there are rules about the floor and she broke them that's why she was told to g. Just stating what they said
I've never been crazy about Elizabeth Warren. But I think we need all the help we can get. So that shades my opinion.
but it's too much fun. Her and trump are a lot alike they like attention and lie
@SenatorTomUdall Thank you from Pennsylvsnia! #letlizspeak
Why does HE get to do it when #LetLizSpeak wasn't allowed to? Because he has a penis?
@TheSavvyDSTGyal Sexism is alive & well in the US Senate!
Contents of letter did not change. No rebuke. They aren't even TRYING to hide their game anymore. I'm sickened by what I see
Was he rebuked and censured like @SenWarren? If not, wonder why? Interesting. . .
Thank you @tomudall
Thank you for doing what is right.
@ShaunKing Well only one thing has changed since E. Warren tried to read it. I wonder what that could be? Hmmmm...
thank you great follow up to silencing @SenWarren #NoTrumpNWay!
wow #ShePersisted
Ok, so instead of letting HER proceed they let a MAN do it.  I AM DISGUSTED BEYOND REASON. SHAME ON THE SENATE FLOOR.
Way to go @SenatorTomUdall ! All @TheDemocrats should read it
wait-why is he allowed to read it?
@SenatorTomUdall @JoyAnnReid @elizabethforma @SenatorShaheen I want to know why Senator Warren was silenced and not Senator Udall.
Just curious how Udall can read this letter and Warren is silenced? McConnel needs 2 apologize 2 Warren. #misogyny
thank you for not being Trump puppets!
So can somebody explain it to me why it was OK for a man to read it, @MitchMcConell? #ShePersisted
this is awesome, every single Dem Senator should read King's letter  Bravo @SenatorTomUdall #TheResistance #BlueCongress2018
if one gets stopped, the next take up where they got silenced
they're busy burning Eliz Warren at the stake
@tomudall proud to have you as my senator! Thank you. #letlizspeak #Sessionshearing
at this point, I'm more concerned with sessions not being confirmed. We'll get retribution for the treatment of senator Warren soon
Thank you, Sen. Udall!!
my senator. So proud of him to stand up to errant GOP
Guess they #LetHIMSpeak #SheWasWarned #ShePersisted #StopSessions #letlizspeak

http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/08/dr-martin-luther-kings-niece-endorses-donald-trump-believe-many-things-hes-saying/ …
@educatorsresist it's amazing how the @GOP only thinks you're legit if you have a p....y chromosome.
YAS!
just being an ass.
Thank you Sen Udall for continuing to speak for us and for being an ally.
@SenateMajLdr your move mitch.

#ReadTheLetter
@SenatorTomUdall thank you Senator!
Tom Udall, that's my senator!
Glad he read it, but it should have been a black Senator.
@SenatorTomUdall Good for you, Senator! Proud you represent Me in NM. The #GOP is finding shoe on the other foot after past 8 yrs.
Excellent. Let all Dems do it.
And they're letting *him* speak? Yeah, okay, now I'll believe it was sexism.
whatever makes  @SenatorTomUdall guilt feel better.
they break the rules to put GOP in catch 22. Everyone knows this.
@ShaunKing so glad there was a man around to read it. #letlizspeak
@ShaunKing @tomudall kudos!
@krqe good for him!
@mimizelman #letlizspeak

thank You, Senator Udall, for taking up the fight where Senator Warren left off
#Fightforall
@neeratanden Has @SenateMajLdr fallen asleep? #LetLizSpeak #CorettaScottKing #VoteNoSessions
Bless you sir for having the courage to read it dispite the hard hearts of the @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr and @SpeakerRyan
he is a wonderful man! His father&uncle fought 4 civil rights
Thank you for picking up where @SenWarren left off #letlizspeak
liberals and Dems are #hypocrites #Sessions #warren
The @NAACP, which opposes @SenatorSessions for AG, gave him its Governmental Award of Excellence in 2009. http://politi.co/2jZjAPG  
damn right
Its amazing when people say "Democrats still don't know they lost." That didn't stop the GOP from obstructing for the last 8 years
Because they could.....
Keep at it. The foolish Trump supporters are tweeting like mad over this. The truth is stinging their ears. Love it. Speek slower!
What a #CircleJerk  
*
It's so cute, seeing DEMs express their feelings about have NO POSITIVE ROLE in America or its government.
@Lataine16  Corrtta Scott Kings niece supports Donald J. Trump and his choices 
yeah, it is supposed to be hereditary.
"New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall begins reading "   He can READ?
except they fail to say MLKs niece is pro Sessions for prosecuting the KKK
@kgbt race baiting idiots
Go Senator Udall!
glad you are reporting on the "facts, nothing but the facts"
@kgbt but where are @HillaryClinton "lost" emails? Where's the demorats outrage? Zero, nada. Hypocrites.
Get a new argument- also your orange cheeto is using a private server. Outrage?
Seriously, a 30 yr old letter from a dead women. Dems just can't help themselves. Just another desperate ploy to waste more time.
seriously, you want us to follow an old parchment written by dead men? /s
Let's all start writing letters about senators we don't like.  Will ours get read on senate floor?  The new normal.  #MAGA
bye bye. No matter how many times decide to read letter
