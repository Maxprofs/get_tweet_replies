The ofc. of President has too much power. It is now illustrated how checks & balances don't prevent this if not followed. We have a Dictator
Thank you for supporting a special prosecutor for the Russian Links
What Hillary did was illegal and Comey failed to prosecute, he deserved to go. You & @MartinHeinrich drink same Kool-Aid? NO TIES W/ RUSSIA!
He should have been fired when he did the press release on Hillary and her crimes.
Now we know how stupid @realDonaldTrump thinks we are, that we would believe he fired Comey for mis-handling @HillaryClinton emails.
I'm disgusted by the complacency of the @TheJusticeDept & @FBI as Trump's actions are clearly a COVER UP!! More needs to be done & quick!
#1 Ground for impeachment is deliberated obstruction of Justice! Right?
Thank you, Senator & know that everyone is worried & watching what happens next. This firing was blatant obstruction and abuse of power.
Thank you for this clear statement.
Yes! It is time to start the impeachment process. This is obstruction of justice!
Well written. Thank you. We need to stop all Senate activity till the independent investigation is underway. @SenBennetCO @ProgressNowCO
You guys are all such idiots, Russia didn't change our minds, get to the business of protecting America creating jobs and paying down debt
Are you kidding me? You think POTUS thought he fires Comey and the investigation get sidetracked? It will only gain steam. And UR a Senator?
I hope Americans are smart enough to listen to the candidates platform and what they stand for and make an informed decision
The train went off the track for Comey when he suggested Hillary not be indicted. It's not his place as FBI Dir.
As long as Hillary is honestly investigated finally.
OMG!!! Finally, someone with the courage to call it for what it is. Excellent job Senator, & TY..now go show the others how to do it plz. :)
Thank you, Senator! I support your call for an independent investigation.
You partisan hacks loved him, then hated him, then loved him, then hated him. You're just grandstanding. Again.
You should look into what #Sessions has to hide while you are at it. #SessionsRUSSIAinvestigation #trumpRUSSIAinvestigation
Really? There are a lot of people in your state w security clearances that know "intent" has nothing to do w violating security, you don't?
just days ago Schumer said he had lost confidence in Comey. Why the change??
Thank you for your leadership! We must have an independent investigation  #MWEG @mormonweg
Russia did not make people vote for trump, Americans listened to what came directly out of their mouths and voted, you lost and can't get it
Your sir are truly amazing with your drama. Shame on you! You're no leader.
Thank you.
It is so obvious.
TY !
#CountryFirst
You're a paranoid cry baby.
The Presidency has been stolen by a hostile foreign power, and that foreign power is pulling levers to protect itself and keep control.
Thank you, Senator Udall.
Thank you Senator. It is imperative that #TrumpRussiaInvestigation go forward with an #IndependentInvestigation
Thank you Senator I believe you could help save America .
Thank you Senator. You have my support.
Kaithxbai.  Now, actually go DO something about it.
This is obstruction and a pattern Yates, PreetB niw Comey ..what's  in common investigating  Trump/Russia ties
Not ONLY obstruction of justice, but nepotism, business conflicts, lies, abuse of power/office for financial gain! Do your job!
Thank you @SenatorTomUdall NM and the country is behind you. I trust you will do everything in your power to bring truth to the people.
If Sessi9ns had any integrity,  he would have said  "no."
Thank you
Where is Mattis and McMaster during this nightmare? @POTUS is UNFIT 2 LEAD AND A CLEAR & PRESENT DANGER. @RepAdamSchiff @tedlieu
"are" duh
Thank you--keep fighting for our democracy.
twitler has got to go.
Don't back down! 45 is worried...investigators closing in. Save our country from tyranny. We are approaching a constitutional crisis!
Please keep fighting!!
Now you just have to convince republicans of that.
Thank you, @SenatorTomUdall. I hope your courage serves as an example to @SenCoryGardner & @SenBennetCO.
"This decision is chilling."
Please promote the March for Truth scheduled in 32 cities on June 3rd. We need a special prosecutor!
absolutely true !!!!
Why'd he wait so long? Playing a little Russian Roulette??
Thank you Senator! Not from your state but clearly from the same country that you love!
Yeah can name that tune in two words COVER UP
Stop being such a partisan hack, Tom. Comey misled the administration, ignored US Code to protect Hillary and you're all outraged?   Go away
This is clear we need people in power to stand up against the forming dictatorship #trumprussia
Now is the time to act! Have courage and know that you will be on the right side of history. We need a special prosecutor now!
Lock him up for cover-up! Lock him up for cover-up!
You have all strung this matter on long enough! Either you get HIM AND HIS ADMIN OUT NOW, OR WE SHALL ASSUME YOU ARE COMPLICIT
You all need to do more, there is an infiltration of foreign power and you should have the military effectively rectify this #DomesticEnemy!
Yeah, I'm done. No fucking confidence in the current administration. Any new laws are null and void going forward.
can you folks do something?
Now, get rid of McCabe.  #DrainingTheSwamp
@SenatorTomUdall Trump firing FBI Dir Comey compares to Putin killing  opposition!  Need independent council to investigate this dictator!
He was a boy scout, after Hillary comments, he was Trump aid, now he has the goods on Trump..make up,your mind, Dimms.
There is no evidence, ask Feinstine, Clapper and stop being a liar. BTW, he dosent take invest files with him..like @HillaryClinton did.
It is time for all of Congress to call for a resignation of trump. For the good of the country you must act immediately.
Yeah, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see thru Trump's story.
He's an idiot.
Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia.
Thanks Tom! I'm behind ya
We are with you
Thank you Senator! I agree completely! #modernwatergate
We stand behind you - let's get this done. #TrumpRussia #IndependentInvestigation
Thursday's scheduled open and closed testimony by Comey must proceed.
Thank you, Senator. Fight for the people, and our beautiful nation.
Let's demand an #independentInvestigation

Flynn timelineâ€“what is the White House hiding? #TheResistance #trumpRussia #flynn #lockHimUp 
It's time to call out your Repub brethren to move away from Trump starting with my two senators in Arizona. Actions speak louder than words
You give our president too much credit.  He is not above pettiness.
start working on your GOP buddies, Tom.
