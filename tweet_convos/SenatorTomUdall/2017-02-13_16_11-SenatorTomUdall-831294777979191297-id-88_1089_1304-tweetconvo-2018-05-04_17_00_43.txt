On Saturday Mar-a-Lago guests watched @POTUS deliberate w/ foreign leaders w/sensitive documents on the dinner table
This is US foreign policy, not this weekâ€™s Saturday Night Live. GOP should take @POTUS' conduct seriously before we regret the consequences.
The White House may be closed for public tours, but you can get into the Winter White House if you pay $200,000
@badgirl_loony @washingtonpost  good reporting, corruption rampant.  But you couldn't pay many of us to tour DTs WH? Sick!
maybe if you would confirm cabinet instead of being obstructionists they could get the Whit House tours running again.
@debilu2 @washingtonpost That's just to join..add $14,000 a month members fee. Note: B4 becoming POTUS it was $100,000
@JeffersonObama @emilyaheil For $1M @realDonaldTrump will personally guide you through @WhiteHouse in his bathrobe.
stop calling it the winter WH tax payers have not agreed to pay membership for this private resort!
Gee, I could have sworn the WH was owned and paid for by taxpayers. And Trump said he was too smart to pay taxes.
Please don't call it Winter White House
I might be willing to pay that if I knew Trump wasn't going to steal it.
So great that Trump FINALLY returned the government to us, the people.
wouldn't want to go there. Tried last July and no luck!!!
they're covering everything in gold leaf. Takes time.
Putin has the winter palace; 45 has winter white house. Hummmmm
.@SenatorTomUdall @washingtonpost If closing WH tours is what it takes to get GOP leaders off their dead asses, keep them closed.
@hillmanjudy1 @washingtonpost America's Peyton Place Open For Business Only If You #PayToPlay!  #Ethics #Unethical #Resist
Pathetic.  People got who they wanted and must be prepared for what may happen.  It's far from over.
You know, I don't want to go there anymore anyway  I mean what's the point. It's the outhouse now
This is just wrong!!!!
Governing w an audience aside, US tax payers have already paid $9mil for Trump's last 3 weekends-disgrace!
. Is this what you voted for? Because he's going to stand up for the little guy.
we feel very safe knowing this. #FiretheFool
Sir, Please look into what role Tillerson played since he was closest to Putin. Its obvious they all knew whats happening
@judesterworld @washingtonpost Those bastards. That's not his house. It's the people's house.
@DeniseMMurray @washingtonpost This is the Peoples House.. it belongs to every single citizen of the United States..
Russia Hacked Our Election! Please help us! #Impeach!
@sobernhappy @washingtonpost They're just making sure all Russians are hid behind curtains before they allow tours in WH
If you're a foreign spy just get a job there. No background checks, security clearance, or allegiance to US
MOST TRANSPARENT PRESIDENT EVER -  I give you Mr CONald Trump
Should be called "The Winter Whitehouse".
You mean Trump Castle,so drunk on power.Puts whole country in danger.Sick man
SICK!  It belongs to US ....
@ezlusztig @washingtonpost Special photo ops included at no extra charge.
@ezlusztig @washingtonpost CNN, FOX, etc. had coverage regarding same thing in 2013. History repeats itself on both sides.
A lot easier than going through SSBI  @Kragar_LGF
@ezlusztig @washingtonpost You mean you can get into "Czar-a-lago" for $200k!
Why is the White House closed for tours? Anyone ask yet? Is this typical or unusual in a new administration?
which is pocket change for alot  of creeps. "screening" is a bankroll--just think who might come to dinner
ya  mean the Florida WH ????  dont ya
@mmwlawtaos @washingtonpost Heck for $250K you can set foreign policy!
.@SenatorTomUdall But you might get to see classified materials.  What a bargain!
Please don't call it that! Refusing to adopt #45's ridiculous propaganda and language is one small way to keep our sanity
and those who put up 200k R prob vetted unlike illegals and sharia law loving refugees #LiberalLiesMatter
because Melania didn't care enough2find out what traditionally were FLOTUS duties. More interested in her lawsuit
don't get all butt hurt because you weren't invited
I think I'm going to start a GoFundMe page for membership into the Winter White House.  Any takers?
@Karoli But wait, there's more! You get to be part of real-life National Security discussions with Foreign Dignitaries!!!
@Karoli @washingtonpost And pay $14k annually.
@FalconGrrrl @washingtonpost Is looking at classified info an extra charge or included in the price?
@babsben @washingtonpost some rich celebrities should crash it with a protest. @Rosie @Beyonce buy me a spot I'll come with
Respect 4 all you're doing, but please don't refer to Trump's private business as "WWH", only advertises that garbage more.
Isn't it time to figure out another office to handle tour requests besides through #FLOTUS ?
WTF, it's not his house, he can't close it to the public. It's OUR house!!!!
@Monaca6 @washingtonpost perfect place for Russian oligarchs to go
@Submarine_Guy @washingtonpost where the who's who Russian overlords are
@areyou0 @washingtonpost WTF are they doing in there that no one can see? Sinister.
there's no winter WH, only profit for evil corrupt trump on taxpayers $'s.
too many lies, too much deception for public eye. Liars run amuck in corrupt WH ADMIN.
They're fixing it White House as a haunted house for Halloween
Scariest haunted house EVER!
Oh no no no no the white House is not going to become 45's to make $ off of. He WILL divest from it!
@Politics_PR @washingtonpost wouldn't pay 20 cents.
@Politics_PR @washingtonpost let's NOT call it the WWH
Um...this is the Winter White House.  Let's call Mar-a-Lago what it is:  Trump's business.
Why is this ok with the Republicans??  #shame
@kellyg1160 @washingtonpost lmao
please stop calling it that. There is only one White House.
Congress cares more about tours than the monster kleptocratic overlord running amok? Priorities. 2018.
Big names worship at Mar-A-Largo; regular people can't see the "people's house." Legit concern.
@POTUS The White House is the People's House. Tours should resume ASAP.
LOLOLOLOLOL Hard PASS.
For that price you also get to attend unsecured international crisis calls with Don & Steve, and a selfie
@Insurgent_Storm @washingtonpost maybe he's trying to sell off the WH too
@NatalieSuther20 @emilyaheil JHC!
Don't call it Winter WH; it legitimizes.  It's a Trump business location; he's making $$.  Should have used Camp David.
Good point~There's NO "winter White House"~45's for-profit hotel~I cant stand this being normalized #Profit
@debilu2 @SenatorTomUdall @washingtonpost Can you imagine how much more he'll be able to charge to rent "winter White House"!
#HesBroke so needs to stay Trump properties so he can #Profit from taxpayers #resist
His wife already has that covered! 
exactly!
What would R's be doing if this s**t was happening in the Clinton white house? forget resistance. think relentless.
Yep bigley. They'd bring a rope
That is where I plan to make all my calls to when I want to talk to the WH... Here's the number, (561)832-2600
don't call if that! He's profiting off it while costing tax payers millions   Every time he goes
If Obama had done just one of these things, they would have asked for his head on a platter.
Quit whining and take real action. Instead keep us up to date on your actual work to put a stop to this.
this is all so sad. Enough is enough.
.@SenatorTomUdall @washingtonpost It's the King's palace. He doesn't want ordinary people around him. His ppl pay for access.
Trying to help you fight this Senator. The sooner we can end this, the better. Tell #WeThePeople how we can best help you.
It's only closed because Melania isn't doing her job. She's in NYC costing taxpayers $30million/month.
And after all isnt that what @realDonaldTrump is all about. $$ greenbacks look good on his orangeback ;)
