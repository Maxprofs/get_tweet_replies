@SenateDems @POTUS Thank you for standing up for America Mr. McCain!

this dude is a closet democrat all he does is go against trump he's relevant and old school he still don't get it also
Where it's good you're firm on this, you should be saying no to everything he's been signing since the 20th. We have to depend on you.
McCain, where were you when Obama was a loose cannon. MIA. Your personal issues, you need to remember are personal.
Do something about it. Please oppose this lunatic we have in office.
@willkennedynews @POTUS Thank u for being a vocal critic to the lunacy that is Trump. I hope others join u soon.
thank you Sen. McCain.
Thanks for going after Obama all those years, wait you didn't.
You sure about that Mav? You're voting for a lot of rich folks that don't see it that way... Trump AND his cabinet...
THANK YOU4 this!Torture is immoral even in war & it damages us in worldview and imperils safety US citizens internationally
help us obi-wan.  You're our only hope
right on, John! Use ur experience to minimize the damage @POTUS does to our democracy. @TheDemocrats @RepSusanDavis
thank you John McCain! You're an honorable man!
Gang rapes, beheadings, mass executions & simple murder & America refrains from torture. That's what's wrong with us!
@SenSchumer @POTUS Senators, PLEASE, somebody STOP THIS MADNESS!!!
Thank you Senator McCain - you are an amazing man and hero.

@POTUS #ReleaseYourDamnTaxReturns
you might want to tell that to Paul Ryan...
It pained me to place a Dr in front of their names.
Please Act and do something
it's against the Geneva accords
you have shown yourself to be cowardly blowhard when it comes to standing up to #notarealpresident   Whatevs, McCain
It is a damn shame that the GOP are permitting the establishment of a tinpot dictator. All for political power. #AntiScience
@SenJohnMcCain
Thank you but PLEASE protect our lands and parks too! #NoDAPL #ProtectOurPublicLands #resist
many of the decent men and women in the GOP are standing up to @realDonaldTrump. That's gotta get under ur orange skin
He only mentioned waterboarding ONE time during an interview a year ago.  Why not ASK HIM DIRECTLY what he thinks.
then where were u last 8 years when Obama walked over our constitution and had weaken our military?
I saw you speak at WFU almost 15 yrs ago, & always had a great respect for you. STAND UP TO TRUMP. Don't just say it, DO IT.
you must stand up against this @POTUS who's systematically stripping away the freedoms you and others bravely fought for.
Trump thinks he is an all powerful dictator like Putin - the more you give in to him the more he will believe it.
@sabo_brett @POTUS hold the line, Sen. McCain. Thank you!
.@SenJohnMcCain @AdamSerwer Somehow I don't think @POTUS  @realDonaldTrump really gives a damn about the law. Sued twice for discrimination
@USforFreedom @POTUS How's the investigation into their ties to Russia going, Senator?
What if Trump just calls it "enhanced interrogation"? Then it's legal
Grandstanding as usual
haven't seen any EOs bringing back torture, just that he would leave in the capable hands of his people. #Whyurnotpres
_If Flynn was vulnerable to Russian blackmail, Trump is vulnerable to Russian 'compromat'. He must resign now.
U AND YOUR FRIEND LINDSEY NEEDS TO JOIN DNC AND RUN WITH THE RATS WHERE U BELONG
Torture does not work, is cruel and inhumane, is illegal, is immoral, is unethical. Who would want to bring it back?
I love you! Please keep being a voice of reason
@IrvineWelsh @POTUS Respect due.
it's apparent President Trump owns shares in companies directly involved in the pipeline executive order. This is impeachable
I & others published reports on @realDonaldTrump's Investments in KeystoneXL @rbp77 @VLVANCE @SenJohnMcCain https://twitter.com/rbp77/status/824284587274764288 … #NoDAPL

#reclineintheswamp ?
just drone them and the family goat, make it a non issue.
One wonders how much collateral damage (people) Obama killed with his drone strikes.Not a word
I know if I had a choice between faux drowning and being blown to bits with my family which I would choose.
It's amazing these barbarian's kill in the most horrific way and we have bleeding hearts, unreal.
YOU NED TO REMEMBER WHO'S PRESIDENT ITS NOT PRES. MCCAIN ITS PRES. TRUMP SO JEALOUS MCCAIN
TORTURE IS ALSO EVERYDAY GOP KEEPS TRUMP MONSTER IN OFFICE! ITS INEXCUSABLE SEN MCCAIN! MANYGOPS GOING DOWN NEXT VOTE!
@AllbrightNFL @POTUS right torture is reserved for independent contractors. And detainees not classified "pow"
Torture goes against everything The US stands for. Period. Anyone telling you its ok should lose their citizenship.
so... @realDonaldTrump should lose his citizenship?
Anyone who employs torture. Anyone.
anyone who didn't vote for trump should lose their citizenship
NOW WE ALL NO TYPO DID NOT DIDNT!
Really, have you seen the fun and games Isis and the rest of terrier have perpetrated on the captured and our military
you're right...you should know
Then DO something.
If it uses the word "enemies",we should be afraid.Since potus called Americans who speak against him enemies. @SenJohnMcCain
I understand. But he also says he's relying on their word. So we wait and see the order, I guess. @SenJohnMcCain
the head of the CIA said he is open to bringing it back. @suzanne_young @AlcoxtheGreat @SenJohnMcCain
just make them read one of ur op eds. That is torture! Poster. CHild for term limits
U AND LINDSEY GRAHAM DID SUPPORTING HILLARY CLINTON TO GET HER ELECTED SHAME ON U
Yet YOU have no problem taking money from George Soros who worked with Nazis to turn in Jews
#Traitors stick together
U SHOULD RESIGN FROM THE SENATE AND THE GOP AND JOIN THE DNC, ITS SHAMEFUL WHAT U
hey no worries you can teach our troops how to sellout like you did songbird! Shut up!
Don't we Water board navy seals during their training? IF SO.. We can do it on our own, but not to the bad guys?
why not you have torturing me for years!!!
FUCKING DO SOMETHING.
@SenJohnMcCainvthis is the start. Welcome those who resist
@MalcolmNance @POTUS but you will vote Tillerson and hand us to Russia. Makes no sense.
didn't he vote Yes to Pompeo? That's who would do the torture.
welcome resistance. We ask folks to awaken everyday. He did
Thank you. Now please vote against the unqualified #BetsyDeVos . Our children deserve better. #DumpDevos
It seems to me that having him as president is a form of psychological torture for us all.
That's a very very real thing BTW and it's all part of the plan
What is?
His constant lies and deception is a form of psychological torture, at least to me
I think I'm safe in saying it's torture for any sane person
Less talk, sir and more actually standing your ground.  @POTUS thinks he's king.
what the heck does "actually stand your ground" mean? And Drumpf has only been prez a week, sheesh
Five days, and he's already done massive damage, while others posture but don't refuse to endorse.  You can wait. We'll resist.
McCain publicly resisting all over
What are you doing to stop this TRAITOR? We need you & @LindseyGrahamSC 2 stand up for America!
The 2 of them are ALL talk, and in the end $$$Talks for them! #GOPTraitors
Maybe BUT I pray not!
All you have to do is look at voting records! #McCain should be more defiant, he'll retire.
Sad!
sorry John, but you lost all Constitutional credibility with your “only Republicans can nominate SCOTUS” baloney
we welcome all into the light when they are ready. That is the point of it all
Still voted for Tillerson, McCain's not in the light yet.
I agree with you. But being against torture is a low bar.
loving your profile pic : )
aww shucks
Go get 'em!
Thank you Senator McCain.

You have an unfortunate history of speaking up, then eventually capitulating. Do you mean it this time?
Much respect for Sen John McCain. His principles are rock solid. I don't always agree but I always respect him.#AmericanHero#Courage#Patriot
Thankfully not all Republicans are mad and reckless.
please don't cave on this!
Mentally unstable tyrant is @potus. Fucking impeach!!
I never thought I would agree with you, Senator. Thank you for standing up for what is right.
@Rhymestyle @POTUS And yet you gave Obama shit for "over stepping" on using executive orders you two faced hypocrite.
Never thought I'd write it, but bigging up the Senator!
The American people will take you by the word, Sen.
Yes! Thank you! Please help us continue to be the example in the world.
McCain - retire please!  You are nothing more than a RINO obstructionist.
thank you so much for standing up for what is right.
doesn't matter what executive order Putin's bitch signs if the Congress doesn't act on it! Midterms will be of the
utmost importance. VOTE!!!
@mikd33 @POTUS He is the President. Reflects will of majority. You could not achieve this. Respect majority rule
@richeisen I’ve always thought Chinese water torture was the humane way to go if you’re going to torture people
how long until you walk this one back?
It would be nice if @SenJohnMcCain wasn't so prone to caving every time McConnell sneezes at him.
I appreciate your confidence, but I don't share it with our current leaders, ie @potus @realDonaldTrump.
@briankoppelman @POTUS  Thank you Sen McCain.
thank you John McCain #notorture
Is it illegal for the President to order government employees to break the law?
Thank you, John.
.@SenJohnMcCain .@POTUS another obstructionist,  investigate his financial dealings - RICO law
@alisonbuckley @POTUS Coool....where you been John?
What happened to you? Should have stood up a long time ago.
pampered Donald has never felt pain or suffering. Now advocating torture from his throne room. Shameless scoundrel
Then please hold @POTUS accountable. Where are the conservative values of fair play and transparency here?
I too wore a uniform and swore to protect this nation against all enemies, foreign and domestic.  Stand and fight.
We were compelled to disobey illegal or immoral orders.  Failing to do so was a crime in itself.
Millions of Americans have your 6.  Engage!

How about showing a little spine and lead the Republicans in the Senate and Congress against the fascist Trump. He is NOT the GOP.
YES!  You are a true american hero!  #libsformccain
@thomloverro @POTUS did you listen to interview?  He's not going to torture
the law only matters if the House and Senate hold him accountable to it. So far I've seen no evidence that they will.
DO something
12 executive orders in 5 days? Why?  Congress has Republican majority.

http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/01/all-trump-executive-actions-000288 …
Senator, I wish your actions lived up to your statements.
then grow a set and defend us from him
The President said he would leave, enhanced interigation 'water boarding to the Secretary defense, Congress.
Exactly, make ISIS stop beheading their prisoners and forcing them to be sex slaves.
@jfreewright @POTUS You say that, but you sure caved when it came to the confirmation hearings.
McCain, You are a neocon.  When Eisenhower warned of the military industrial complex, he was talking about you.
why do I not believe you?
The American people need your strong opposition and we have your back. Trump is crazy.
@MichaelSkolnik @POTUS  Wake up loon.
first time I've agreed with you in quite awhile, glad to hear it
What are you waiting for?!? Step up. Be a man for God's sake. He mocked you and you're rolling over.

Thank you, Senator McCain.
that's awfully idealistic of you, and thus far the evidence shows he will do whatever he wants.
@MariaESalinas  Finally, Someone talked! We thought we've been alone shocked.
Senator McCain, I thank you for standing fast on this issue.
if the law is the law sir  how can we dismantle aca? Looks like a law to me
sanity is appreciated!
Thanks John. Do you think you can round up maybe ALL of the @GOP and take a stand with the Dems against Trump? Wreckless and un-American
If Grumpy gets it, why doesn't Dopey?
unbelievable that Trump gets support for whatever he does and says. Republicans even lie for him.  mental torture?
would you please run again?
you voted for Pompeo. You support torture.
.@SenJohnMcCain @POTUS Thanks, Sen. McCain for holding firm on the torture issue. Trump  acting like a #Dictator his first week on the job.
thank you
Thank you @SenJohnMcCain for your principled stand on @POTUS disturbing action. And your #GOP colleagues?
Then get to work man. This shit is out of control and you are one of the last heroes.
Thank you. Trump was so disrespectful to you during the campaign. I'll never forget that
this country is going to self implode while the world watches. Some dangerous level of stupidity coming to the surface
Sir, I hope that you're right.
Ty @SenJohnMcCain for standing up to @POTUS  on torture.
Time for you to go Senator McCain. I stand with the President.
@kairyssdal @POTUS but keep supporting his nominees. Show some spine senator McCain. America needs you.
Guess us Dems had better admire @SenJohnMcCain since our own @SenateDems haven't the juice to do a SINGLE F***ING THING for themselves.

@CynthiaDelmar @POTUS Are you not repealing the Affordable Care Act as well?
good for you
demonstrate that you're a man of participles and stand up to this tyrant! I once believed you were different, prove it!
is tearing families apart and treating a whole group of people as second class citizens considered torture?
TRUMP is not concerned with rules or convention.   we need his taxes to know who owns him!Legislate it NOW
Of all the ppl that could've notified you what Russia was doing with Drumpf, it was Palin. #thankstotrump
Resist.
@IvoHDaalder WHAT ABOUT ALL HIS OTHER EXECUTIVE ORDERS?! U CANT STAND BY & LET THIS FASCIST RUIN OUR COUNTRY!
@briankoppelman maybe if U stop confirming his cabinet picks, that would be a start to stopping this maniac
@vanevazquez130 @POTUS I'D BE DAMMED TO LET my kids fight a WAR4this fool wanting2STEAL & TORTURE People from other countries
Senator we are counting on you as a voice of sanity in this administration! #speaktruthtopower
Well Sen. McCain, it's up to you and the few sane Republicans left to block action by your mentally ill leader.
Look who you are talking about, the man is one step away from wearing the brown shirt, missile parades?
.@SenJohnMcCain @POTUS let's see if this is another bark vs bite sitch.
the minute you sided with @realDonaldTrump you backed Torture sir. You may claim to be against it, but you backed it.
The GOP needs to stop Trump.  American people deserve the truth, not alternative facts.
You are such a has been. Why don't you just go to pasture where you belong. ( From a Proud Arizonain )
You sir, have no BACKBONE
glad to see you are on the side of the American people Mr McCain thank you.
Then why did you vote to confirm Pompeo. He said he was open to water boarding. You have to stand up to Trump.
@lindseyhilsum @POTUS McCain the liberal! Don't make me throw up!
you're wrong, he'll steam roll this through.
we'll just have Blackwater/Academi do it for us.
@dagnificent @POTUS 
Thank you! Illegal, immoral and ineffective.
Thank God for a voice of reason.  And from someone who has served well!
Senator, you know what i mean when I say this president is NOT a real Republican. He's a traitor. STOP HIM.
.@SenJohnMcCain @POTUS The maverick is back?
@jfreewright @POTUS  Then please Sir, DO SOMETHING!  Help us!
@ANNELAMOTT @POTUS Then stand up to him and take him down. He's in violation of the constitution. Start the impeachment now!
do not believe you, your all tslk
we should tho.
I think @realDonaldTrump wants to golden-showerboard is prisoners. Not waterboard. Alternative water. Easy mistake.
This is just the beginning. You and your fellow Repugs have to stand up to his agenda, or be traitors.
you lost your credibility when you confirmed Tillerson after they promised you smth. Same this time? Smth to accept torture?
finally someone who SPEAKS the Truth !!
I believe the law is that he's your superior, and you are being insubordinate.
#POTUS 
@POTUS
He's not above the law. As we saw this evening, federal judge overturned his EO on Muslim ban. He goin down
Judge did not overturn,cannot do that to executive order.Only allowed people with visas into country
@Cindyg1948Cindy @mgcrich @jandekr @SenJohnMcCain @POTUS judge was just making a political statement, were doing the right thing
Give @POTUS a copy of http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/160893.A_Question_of_Torture …
thank you Sen McCain! Take a stand for truth integrity & humanity against a delusional narcissist #WeAreThePopularVote
You are correct, Sir!
you haven't stood up to this man & either has your party.
The GOP is awfully quiet as you watch Trump take down this country one executive order at a time.
But you'll sell out for just about any other thing he brings up your tired dried out hack! 
#Human #BeefJerky
Thank you, Senator John McCain
