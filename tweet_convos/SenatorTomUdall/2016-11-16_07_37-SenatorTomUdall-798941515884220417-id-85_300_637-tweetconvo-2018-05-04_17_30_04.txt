If you ve been in Congress more than 12 yrs. It's not about serving the country.It's self service to your wallet.
Says you who supports a man who uses tax payer money to advertise his & his family's products. Smdh @SenateDems @SenSchumer
Provide proof of your claim, not political talking points!
Best part? He'll be impeached within a year for numerous ethics and legal violations #CannotWait @SenateDems @SenSchumer
Remember those riots in 2008 & 2012? I don't, why Liberals have to act foolish when there candidate lost?
Protests, sweetie, not riots SenateDems @SenSchumer
Riots in Portland is a protest? Really? Get a grip on reality, get a job, go to work, be productive in society
You think you can bully a woman? Think again, Mr. Misogynist. http://You.Do.Not.Want.To.Fuck.With.Me . @SenSchumer
Yep everyone with Liberal views, apparently you must have already forgotten how badly beaten. More of the same? LOL
seems the study that shows how public opinion has no effect on Congress's decisions will continue to be true.
too bad you spent a year not supporting the one that fucking mattered.
You must be getting comfortable with the status of minority party
@SenateDems @SenSchumer

Bernie Sanders is a independent why you give him a leadership positions in our party democrats it's not fair to other democrats
Why he won't change parties he always talk bad bout the democrats not going to accept him or Nina Turner come on Schumer
No democrat has ever fought for the middle class. Quit lying to the American ppl. We r not stupid.
...
No. Most of them haven't. They only come around when they need votes then climb back into bed with big $$ donors.
is Bernie all of the sudden a Democrat. We can thank him for Trump
THANK YOU.  Stand tall, stand for the people. Save medi-care, so many depend on it.
Hillary Clinton and the Democrats lost the middle and working class
#Thank you
Bahahaha! How can you say this with straight face? This is the most stacked special interest group of Senators ever.
Keep fighting. Stop Ryan on Medicare/Medicaid and social security.
please don't let Ryan gut our Medicare and cut our SS our very lives depend on it!  It's our money we paid into
The people DON'T want corporate wall st libs leading the Senate! You can't straddle the line any more. In or out!?
and all their efforts have done NOTHING for the middle class but have increased THEIR wealth by triple digit %
@SenatorTomUdall @SenSchumer Obstruct and deny! That's your mandate. #2018 #2020
@TheDemocrats YOU AREN'T DEMOCRATS, THERE'S NOTHING DEMOCRATIC ABOUT ANY OF YOU!

YOU'RE INFILTRATORS & WE KNOW IT!

one would think you would have made a little more progress by now...did help special interests though #truth
then why are we worse off now after the last 8years and you are better off
Now that's settled. Now make Trump show you his taxes. Did his campaign operate illegally? Is he Putin's puppet?
you just lost every election from now on. Congrats.
shouldn't be minority leader. We need new ideas and a fresh face. Not business as usual.
You that keep criticizing these leaders, remember a lot of the fault falls to the Republicans who paralyzed congress
And blame you for what doesn't. Democrats never learn
File this away. If U work with Trump, Ryan, McConnell after 8 yrs of  saying NO, they will take credit 4 what works
Who are you going to blame for the disappearing middle class...Russia?
Make Trump get rid of Bannon.  That'd be a good start.
congratulations @SenSanders and @SenWarren glad to see real progressives in party leadership
.@SenateDems @SenSchumer POTBELLY-ASS HAS 100 YEARS OF PROGRESSIVE ADVANCEMENT TO OBLITERATE IN 4 YEARS
you #Democrats will never learn
.@SenateDems @SenSchumer Wait! Bernie, an Independent, is the "Dem Outreach" chair? DEM outreach? Yeah, that makes perfect sense.
DEMS PC CULTURE THATS WHY AMERICA HATES US  CROOKED HILLERY LYING DEB W AND DONNA B TO MANY CROOKS IN OUR PARTY DUMP PELOSE!!!!!
#DemExit #DemExit #DemExit
Schumer Wall St/Banks best bud, Durbin Chicago pol, Murray dumb as a brick, Warren - dishonest.  SAD
Where is  @SenFranken b/c I trust him more than most on that list.
& the middle class has suffered the most these past years, go figure
@DaleF3 No, those of us who used to be the middle class suffered the most!
these Dems have been stealing from America for a life time Drain the swamp
Bernie Sanders is not a Democrat. Why is he on there???
Dear @SenateDems if -3% economic growth & Obamacare is ur idea of "fighting for the middle class"... #EpicFail @MichaelMcGuire_ @SenSchumer
So is BS going to Join the Democratic Party? Or just Use us again?
Suuure! You mean you have fought to line your pockets and thosr of your special interest groups!
Too liberal is why she lost. Sanders is not even a Democrat.
So, someone who isn't a Democrat got named chair of outreach?? That's not going to cause any division.........
But the middle class is now in poverty.
@DaleF3 @SenateDems @SenSchumer No. Those of us who used to be the middle class are in poverty!
.@SenateDems as they continue to strengthen Dem exit with these HORRIBLE choices @SenSchumer
Please tell me how do you know what "those" need if you don't speak to them directly? You need to meet with Cmty Ldr
it would be nice if you fought drug companies instead of taking their money #Teva #MSisforever
Excellent batting order! Now, let's knock the cover off the ball! (Sorry for the baseball analogy after the season.)
keep up the good work!  Your time and efforts are appreciated!
The @ElectoralCollge & The @TheDemocrats must work 2gether in blocking Trump & rightfully appointing Hillary as Pres
Do want us to believe this lol
Bernie's not a democrat and he ran a negative primary campaign that hurt the party in the general.
He ran a campaign about the issues & HRC had overflowing closet of skeletons. Not his fault she sucks

Democrats don't even know who the middle class is anymore
