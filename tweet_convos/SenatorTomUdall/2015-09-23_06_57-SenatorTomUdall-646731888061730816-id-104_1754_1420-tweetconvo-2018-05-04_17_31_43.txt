@WhiteHouse @Pontifex Didn't the Pope just fly here on an airplane and he's talking about climate change!? I'm confused!
@BigJeffNYC @WhiteHouse @Pontifex Oh & btw, the new $1.4 billion #AirForceOne (Boeing 747-8) flies around on unicorn farts.
#GHG scammers
.@WhiteHouse @Pontifex @POTUS Why are there soldiers & marines behind His Holiness while he tries to promote peace throughout the world?
@WhiteHouse @Pontifex What about Debt? Is that ok to be left to next generations?
Thats why US Constitution article 1 sec 8&10 mandates ONLY precious metals legal tender TO SAVE THE TREES @rguezcheca @WhiteHouse @Pontifex
Most Bishops don't have a problem cooperating with the evil of Fiat Specie or it's banker politicians @rguezcheca @WhiteHouse @Pontifex

@WhiteHouse @CarolineKennedy @Pontifex answer is don't do bad amen. Our lord jesus christ is great amen. TRUE freedom is don't do bad amen.
@WhiteHouse @Pontifex Wrong! It's a political hoax that makes everyone poorer and government more controlling. Climate changes naturally.
@WhiteHouse @Pontifex Gr8 to hear Pope talk about #ClimateChange It is important to have one more world leader talk about its importance
.@WhiteHouse .@StateDept .@Pontifex what about #KeystoneXL South approved by .@POTUS Exec Order same as north except 4 border crossing
@WhiteHouse @Pontifex Truly.....
@WhiteHouse @terri_georgia @Pontifex Listen to  Pope and we can save Earth. Listen to GOP and we'll ruin it,
@POTUS @WhiteHouse @Pontifex What about the emissions from the pope-plane because #Obama was #LateForThePope?
@WhiteHouse @adamsvisuals @Pontifex I suppose a religious priest, Rabbi etc can speak politics only if its leftist tinfoil hat junk.
@WhiteHouse @RepLowenthal @Pontifex By all means fight war in climate, Dems. Russia taking care of Mid East important.
@WhiteHouse @CarolineKennedy @Pontifex ベトナム戦争の時代、AmericaはPope Paul Ⅵを仲介とした北ベトナムとの交渉を行った。交渉に当たったのはヘンリー・キッシンジャーでした。ヘンリー・キッシンジャーは多数来日している。

@WhiteHouse @CarolineKennedy @Pontifex I don't think so, You mean disastrous administration. JFK rocks!!
@WhiteHouse @CarolineKennedy @Pontifex 
Anybody with good heart agreed with Pope, but GOP front runner didn't never give him WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse @Pontifex #savetheplanet and stop #climatechange! Use #cleanenergy and #renewables!  #recycle what you can!
@WhiteHouse @Pontifex isn't repentance and salvation more important?!
@WhiteHouse @Pontifex Which is probably the STUPIDEST thing a Pope has EVER said.  Warming, cooling cycles:  ALL NATURAL, ALL GOD = NOT man
@WhiteHouse @fwdcrocblu @Pontifex Rotten politicians paid by fossil industries must be investigated like tobacco execs lying about cancer
@WhiteHouse @politikelle @Pontifex geesh, if only all these clappers wld have a heart soul & morals - our #World cld look PEACEFUL #War
With all due respect, @Pontifex, #ActOnClimate is a hoax & has NO impact on the worlds's population #PopeInDC @WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse @USEmbRu @Pontifex Ты кого из себя мнишь.......встань , когда говорит ПАПА
@WhiteHouse @USEmbRu @Pontifex Забота о будущих поколениях? Лицемерие.., когда люди сейчас умирают от воин США.
@WhiteHouse @Pontifex Climate changes all the time. Eat less meat which production makes large amount of methane
@WhiteHouse 
日本の安部政権が原発再稼働で、御迷惑をお掛けした事を法王にもお伝え頂けますようお願いいたします。
@WhiteHouse @Pontifex 
@WhiteHouse God sent man.  Bless him lord. Bless this Pope.
@WhiteHouse Such a nice speech.  God Bless.
@WhiteHouse @Pontifex Man made climate change is about as real as unicorn farts. Only the truly ignorant believe this crap. Like the Pope.
@WhiteHouse @Pontifex climate change  formerly "global warming " is garbage  science.  More regulations  would hurt the middle class & poor.
@WhiteHouse @Women4Bernie @Pontifex Or the Republican party!
@WhiteHouse @Pontifex i ma now online it has started hahaha
@WhiteHouse @Pontifex So dark the attitudes of a few, so disrespectful toward promise. I pitty your souls.
@WhiteHouse @usembassyottawa @Pontifex  Thank You Pope Francis for arriving in the USA.  I AM A BELIVER and love your message. #iLoveJesus
@WhiteHouse @tram_mai @Pontifex Nor can persecution of Christians, child sex abuse by church clergy and 2nd class status of women
@WhiteHouse @SenatorTomUdall @Pontifex Yup. Open up markets and let abundant energy supply continue human innovation 2 deal w/climate.
@WhiteHouse @mary_swilling @Pontifex #PopeInDC
@WhiteHouse @Pontifex we need a whole lotta less talking, and waaay more action.  Most of it is easy, if we can dilute the greed a bit.
Climate Pope Francis is just as hypocritical as Climate Pope Al. He charters an Airbus A330 for one and pontificates about CO2! @WhiteHouse
@NormalCommunity @WhiteHouse Not all CO2 is the same. His is exempt from any negative effects.
@SurferObserver @WhiteHouse Oh, it's like the Commie millionaires of Labour? I shouldn't rush to judgement so quickly.
@NormalCommunity @WhiteHouse Commie millionaires shouldn't pay tax. We should pay them to live among us on planet Earth.
@SurferObserver @WhiteHouse We are especially bless right now. It's a good time to be alive.
@NormalCommunity @WhiteHouse It's Die Happy 4.0!
@WhiteHouse @Pontifex so many problems of faith you think you stay out of the climate change#BS
@WhiteHouse When the damage provoked can,t be repaired, is not enough to say: I,m sorry. Catholic church supported Pinochett or Argentina,s
RT @WhiteHouse “Climate change is a problem that can no longer be lft to a future generation." @Pontifex #PopeInDC
@JohnDigles @WhiteHouse @Pontifex you go lefty you no matter what the scientists say you keep pushing the agenda
@WhiteHouse Complicity with genocide -PioXIIth and Hitler- more than 20.000 sexual crimes recorded in the last 50 years, corruption
@WhiteHouse @Pontifex It,s not a good idea at all. The vatican holds plenty of criminal records on its recent background

@WhiteHouse @MariaTeresa1 @Pontifex but, if USA invests in green energy, romney might only have millions, not billions, to hide off shore???
@WhiteHouse @Pontifex Been deceived by lies.
@WhiteHouse @EPA @Pontifex  he's just another person trying to claim he's an expert.
@WhiteHouse @EPA @Pontifex We won't have a future generation if we don't stop murdering them before they are born.
@WhiteHouse @Pontifex enough I f the bull craps climate change. Just a liberal tactic to take more money from tax payers

Thank you very much!!

@WhiteHouse @Pontifex
@WhiteHouse @Pontifex this is a lie
@WhiteHouse @Pontifex Hope with Pope!
What future generation? @WhiteHouse @pontifex 
#BadIranDeal will fix that 
@WhiteHouse @Pontifex he has a warm and kind voice.
@WhiteHouse @Pontifex  a real pope preaches Christ alone.  Climatism is the religion used to bring down the wealthy and subjugate the poor.
@WhiteHouse @Pontifex you have to love the Pope!  It's sad how, like @BarackObama.. He gets a lot of criticism for making the world better
@ravenwings0205 @WhiteHouse @CutestBabyInUSA @Pontifex geez, there really are stupid people. Blocked for being especially that way.
@WhiteHouse @Pontifex historical!
@WhiteHouse @Pontifex No one listened to the hippies in the '60s or did they? Seems like many waited to do something until it was for profit
@WhiteHouse @Pontifex great tuning between Mr Obama and Pope Francis!
