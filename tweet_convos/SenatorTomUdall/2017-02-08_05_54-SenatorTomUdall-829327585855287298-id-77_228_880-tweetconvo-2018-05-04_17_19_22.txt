Glad you were able to read Mrs. King's letter aloud
thanks for your support--but please tell me why @SenWarren was silenced & you were not. Another shame for @McConnellPress
That's easy. He's a man.
Keep up the good work!
Get'r done cowboy! Lmao!
Thank you for your integrity to stand up for what you believe.
Too bad it didn't help! He is now AG! Republicans win again. Win win win.

Thank you, Senator Udall, for standing strong against repression w/ Senator Warren & liberty lovers.
Personal attacks are job one for you!
Republicans can silence the reader but not the letter. Republicans vote the RNC plank w/o question.
It appears to be that DEMS call out racism so much that perhaps they are the real racists themselves
Bless you, Senator! 
@SenatorTomUdall @SenateDems @SenWarren
@MartinHeinrich THANK YOU!
Please vote NO on sessions. Thanks for the hard work!

And being racist. There's that.
