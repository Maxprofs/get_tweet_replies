Thank you for saying what @POTUS will not say.  It is past time for impeachment.
This is a lie. @realDonaldTrump clearly did condemn the hate in all its forms.
Because you do not condemn @realDonaldTrump's words and actions, you are complicit. You should also have to suffer the same consequences.
Not good enough! The voters are waiting for you to take a stronger stand, join the @GOP and REMOVE @realDonaldTrump from White House!
Why didn't you call out the vigilantes who might have started the violence ? Favoritism causes racism . Condemn all
What about Antifa?  BLM? Are you even aware of all the groups involved? We are too great for hate, but hate is coming from all sides!
This statement is perfect - but it needs to be followed with action - what specific steps are you going to take to combat this hatred?
I guess you do not believe in free speech? The most vile hate speech is protected free speech.
Now please condemn @POTUS' blaming violence on "both sides" and urge House to impeach/invoke 25th amend. He is a Nazi sympathizer. Is GOP?
I wonder why you still support this racist administration then. And racist voter suppression laws. You helped create this climate.
He has no backbone. Mike Crapo will never speak I'll of a GOP President. He's one of the good ole boys. #Resist
@MikeCrapo thank you sir. All I wanted to hear. I promise it's okay to stand up to @realDonaldTrump. Your constituents should come first.
What happened to standing for what is right and let the chips fall where they may. Partisan politics got in the way I guess.
But YOUR president supports white supremacy. It's time to #ImpeachNow or #25thAmendmentTime
You're a RINO in Dem clothing Senator. Both sides should be condemned. You're a perfect example why we need term limits. Dems got to you.
Please, do not compare the counter protesters to the White Supremacist, Nazi, Scum. Trying to displace blame shows you are complicit.
I agree with and support your statement. Do you also condemn violent hatred from the left in the form of #BlackLivesMatter & #Antifa?
Thank you for speaking out when many in your party won't.  Please continue to stand up to Trump against his dangerous agenda.
This is not good enough. You must call out the president for not denouncing KKK and Nazis. #SayHisName #impeach
Good start. Now vote for censure of The Donald.
pathetic response...keep supporting that treason man in the WH
Idaho had to take a hard stance on Nazis to end their  violence. @POTUS aligns himself w/Nazis. Please call for resignation.
What do you think, Trump?
Are there some "fine people in this group?
Your words mean nothing without action. Do something. Call out @realDonaldTrump for supporting white supremacists.
Senator, the leader of your party just sided w domestic terrorists officially today. Its now time to take back ur party or lose it to them
And now what's your reply to @realDonaldTrump who's totally clinical?  Please take a stand for the US 
@GOP is like an echo chamber of hollow cowardice. #Impeach
you forgot to mention that they are christian terrorists
IMPEACH NOW. You know it's the right thing to do. Be a leader!
As my Senator, disgusted this is all you would say. President Lincoln stood for values & fought to stop racism.
The head of YOUR party.. just went off the rails again. Still support this madman?
When do you step up and get him out of office. Him or you!!!!
Do you accept support from white supremacists, or do you reject it? Do you think Trump should reject support from white supremacists?
@MikeCrapo proves Idaho has a senator that can take a humanist, moral stand. Now what will you do with Bannon/Miller/Gorky/Brietbart crew
How about a statement on judge Navarros tyrannical reign in the courthouse of NV.
Trump doesn't get it-  says may pardon Arizona ex-sheriff Arpaio: Fox News http://reut.rs/2wYccWN .
Thanks. Your pal "Russian Risch" seems tacitly supportive of Nazis unfortunately.

Thank you, @MikeCrapo What is @SenatorRisch waiting for?
@SenetorRisch finally posts 3 tweets after DJT makes 3rd weak attempt but still didn't say DOMESTIC TERRORISM. Was Risch taking DJT que
That's all well and good, but you need to tell the President.  Words do matter.
3 tweets @SenetorRisch still no DOMESTIC TERRORISM from the "party line" droneAre you still taking campaignfrom NoIdaho supremacists
You must denounce Trump. He is not too great for hate. Do your job. Represent us.
Great, now start standing up to groups right here, like America's Promise Ministries, the American Redoubt, Aryan Nations remnants, etc.
Took you a little too long, but thank you. Now time to stand up to #treasonweasel @realDonaldTrump. #countrybeforeparty
Change needs to happen and it start with you, me, us and them.
THANK YOU for calling the event what it is!
I am not fooled by detractors from the real issues.
Thank you, Senator Crapo. We would love to have a face-to-face discussion with you. We will be civil.
So what are you going to do about it?
Thank you for your statement. What are you doing as a Senator to help keep fascists and Nazis out of our streets -- and our White House?

Sorry, previous comments and actions or lack of them tell me you sympathize with white supremacist views.
Please work to impeach him so I can get some sleep #TerrifiedInIdaho
not so fast on credits here. it like looking at a house on fire and we praise them for saying a house is on fire. what are u doing to fix it
you boys have courted these types of fringe folks for years,now the  consequences of the desire to win at any cost is raising it's ugly head
The GOP must do more to stand up for humanity before it's too late.
What about  Antifa and BLM??? Nothing to say about them Crapo?? No big surprise you do nothing disgrace to the Republic. We won't forget!

Then why must you speak so hatefully about your Democratic counterparts. You fail to realize the problems which you have created. #idpol
thank you.
Do what's right Mike! As a constituent of yours it is time to remove the dung heap occupying the White House and make Idaho & America SAFE
Thank you, Senator @MikeCrapo
Glad u finally came around to denouncing them. We may be small, but the POC in #idaho deserve a rep that cares about our welfare!
Thank you, next up address it with #POTUS
ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS.
Thank you for calling it what it is!  @realDonaldTrump
Please tell POTUS and Sen Risch.
Thank you for representing true patriots in Idaho by condemning this terrorist action.
At least You called it Domestic Terrorism. @NBCNews @ABC  @CBSNews @FoxNews @CNN @RT_America @BBCNorthAmerica Pay attention to Sen. Crapo
Thank you. Your the only rep from idaho who denounced racism and hate.
83805 appreciates your statement on this tragedy.With thanks.
The next step is to disavow the man in the White House who foments this kind of racism and hate. It's time for him to go.
well said. As your constituent I have been disgusted by the flirting with the alt right that has been happening.
Better late than never, senator. Now call upon Trump to do more and we will know you are taking this seriously.
Agreed. Senator Crapo, Idahoans urge you to start showing some leadership and do something about this defunct administration.

A day late, Senator, but at least you called it what it was/is! Unlike your friend in the White House
Premeditated 
Your "breaking news" had to do with Charlotte, NC not Charlottesville. But details are often confusing aren't they?  #mensa
Thank you for responding and for calling this what it was.
You are my senator. Condem All Violence.
And thank you for your statement.
There will be a vigil tonight at 7 pm at the Ann Frank Memorial.  You are more than welcome to join us.
Oh were they driving cars into American citizens walking on the street? Oh right. That was the hater.
A little late but thank you.
Thank you for issuing a strong statement with accurate terminology. We must not abandon our values in the face of terror.
tell these two
Now condemn the inaction of @realDonaldTrump, and we'll be talkin.
Nice statement, thank you Mr.Crapo.
