He must take full responsibility for this unacceptable disrespect of women, renounce it and apologize, no excuses.
Don't kill any kids and we'll be fine with a foul mouth! By the way, do you engage in the same activities as HRC and Bill!?
It was your co-conspirators who made a private male posturing bonding convo public. Maybe you should apologize
#Trump did apologize. I will not be voting for you! You have abandoned the people by by pulling your support from the GOP nominee
I guess those comments are fine now,you 'Christian", hypocritical coward.I hope u & the GOP suffer immensely, as u don't luv USA.
.@MikeCrapo Not remotely as outrageous as your lying & lack of actual principles. Hopefully you'll pay 4 this big time..excuse me.BIG LEAGUE

How about that #DUI
Clintons are going to destroy this country I could less what that he said in private. I do care that a rapist will be in WH again
thank you for disavowing Trump. Now, please take the next bold step and endorse the best man @Evan_McMullin
Grow UP! It's gonna be a bumpy ride. The Clinton's thrive in the gutter. Trump is the only choice! Grow a pair!
Comments made By @realDonaldTrump have not Cost good American life , stop the wavering GOP, don't quit the fight!
Trump has been disrespectful to all except his buds Putin and rich white men right from the gate. Were you outraged then?
OH CRAP
do like his joss lahyuagq
Do the right thing...pull your support. He is vile. He is not fit to run our country. #SickandWrong
.@MikeCrapo You're right, of course, but please, explain how you didn't reach this conclusion a year ago?
apologies are too little too late
what good is an apology when it really isn't meant, we know when a person is sincere and heartfelt you accept an apology Trump no
so sad u think rape is ok but comments said in private arent. u havent said something about a women to a man, u deny, u lie.
Heard that you said some pretty ripe stuff when you were drunk and getting your DUI - el Crapola!
More vulgar words used on Twitter & any on any given Sat Sun on golf course. #Trump supporter's don't re-elect this RINO. #MAGA
Demeaning? So it's not true that many women LET celebrities grab/do anything they want? On which planet? @MikeCrapo
Apologizing does not change his BASIC character. He is a rat!
he apologized --- so you pull your support ? Liar --- #RECALLCRAPO #NeverHillary
you support Hillary and how she treats both men and women that protect her? https://shar.es/1EWLhD 
Yes they were but actions by Hillary r far worse remember when she made fun of a CHILD who had beenRaped by someone she defended
Senator, with all due respect, Mr Trump is admitting to and bragging about sexual assault. These are not just "comments".
your last name says it all CRAPO, and you're full of it... how did anyone even want to elect you.
NOT nearly as outrageous as U and UR colleague have been in allowing Obama to eviscerate America
HYPOCRITE is thy name
he did. As a woman, I accept. As a woman, I've heard women say the same lewd things and worse about men AND women.
he doesn't know how!
when are you guys gonna apologize to US the people for the lousy job you are doing ?
the issue is not language he bragged about assaulting women.
it's not the COMMENTS that are outrageous per se, but the CONDUCT he describes,which many women have testified to. Sexual assault
not enough Senator! That condemnation is not enough!
he describes how he sexually assaults women. An apology isn't enough. I don't support that and you shouldn't either
Not enough. It's too little too late for him. Please disavow him and stand behind a principled conservative.
Withdraw your endorsement. Follow Utah GOP's lead. Demonstrate that Idahoans stand for respect and can do better than Trump.
and the status of your endorsement???
I'm from your district in ID. Be carful how you talk, I haven't seen any tweets about Bill getting oral sex in the WH. Or emails!
His apology will mean nothing. America deserves better.
How about you withdraw your support of @realDonaldTrump. It's the right thing to do.
that's a great idea Dawn. Are you reading this, Mike?
unless you're no longer endorsing him, kindly SHUSHHH!
@IdahoStatesman Where's Crapo on voting for Trump?
NOT good enough!
an apology is insufficient. Dropping out of the race is the only recompense for such an appalling man.
.@MikeCrapo But are you still supporting him?
Your problem is his word choice?!?
you're full of crap-o
Will a professionally written insincere apology have any value though? Not to this woman.
No, he needs to step down. Period.
@IdahoStatesman why is it the g.o.p eats it's own . Just run with him or get out of the race
And what if he refuses? Donald's counting on you to have zero integrity
@IdahoStatesman my god hillary has said worse about woman that that
So what exactly would it take for you to recind your endorsement?  Are we back to shooting someone on 5th Ave?
so it wasn't enough that he disparaged a Hispanic beauty queen.  #trumptrasheswomen
he admitted to sexual assault! He is currently charged with tape of a young girl! What part of unfit don't U get? U R a coward
This doesn't count if you are still supporting Trump. It's basically just crap. Pardon the pun.
Sir an apology will not change who he is & allow him to be POTUS
@sapienist Meaningless apologies don't fool anyone. He's sorry he got caught. GOP didn't care abt women BEFORE.
no apology will erase the fact he assaulted women! RAPE IS RAPE, if you are touched, kissed without consent is assault
@politicalwire why start now when y'all are on a roll.
the Foxnewsians created the Trumpians and the GOP fell apart @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @SarahPalinUSA
not far enough, mike #unendorse
.@MikeCrapo but you are still keeping your endorsement of him? Will you vote for him? How ill you explain that to your wife?
Can we assume you are still endorsing the "grab them by the crotch" shitbag for president?
Shame @MikeCrapo shame. How can you not state this man is unsuited to be President
@politicalwire do you still back @realDonaldTrump for president?
you are a coward in not withdrawing your endorsement. This man is a threat to our Nation-shame on you for party over country!
did you just wake up from a long nap?
It's more than just "language," mister. He is confessing to and bragging about SEXUAL ASSAULT.
@IdahoStatesman #enough
But will you continue to support him? The women and people of Idaho deserve better.
.@MikeCrapo is an apology really enough? He needs to drop out of race, you need to apologize for not expecting more.
@aravosis any apology HE makes is disingenuous, insincere. He is unacceptable as a candidate for president.
And then what?
@BeatDonaldTrump An apology doesn't matter. He is who he is and will always be. The man said 70, he's not going to change now.
but you still support him, right? Weak.
@IdahoStatesman Sir, I heard his apology & I was satisfied. He seemed ashamed an embarrassed.As a woman & Christian, I let it go
.@MikeCrapo @politicalwire yet you STILL SUPPORT HIM!
But you're still voting for and endorsing him, right? If so, please spare us your crocodile tweets.
@MaggieJordanACN But I'm still happy to be supporting this sexist racist all the way to Election Day!
@politicalwire Until you withdraw your endorsement, you continue to own Trump.
But you will still be voting for him, right?
@politicalwire - Save your apologies
Do you withdraw support for him?
do you still endorse him?
Still endorsing him?  Grow a backbone, Senator!
But u still endorse him & will vote for him? Do you have a wife or daughters?
@IdahoStatesman And step down.
@politicalwire ...but I will still vote for him.
@politicalwire lol. Oh bill
But you're unmoved with that endorsement, huh? Figures.
@MaggieJordanACN Senator those aren't just comments. Forcibly kissing & grabbing a women's pussy is assault. #LockHimUp
@politicalwire she should pull out of the race. #NeverPredatorTrump
@aravosis And then what?
but you still endorse him, so you can take a seat
You guys better start distancing yourselves/taking an actual stance, we're not going to forget this shit for YEARS of elections.
@sunnyright  Well Bill Clinton likely raped a woman. So there's that.
And that, my friends, is why his friends call him Crapo. Weasel words.
@aravosis Wouldn't "immediately" have been like 10 years ago?
But Steve Yates @IdahoGOP is asking politicos not to take the bait.
Politicos stop taking bait. This isn't about what someone said 5, 10, 20yrs ago. It's about breaking country free from DC/media elites.
Apologize for the rape of the Constitution and US citizens.
@aravosis Mike, youâ€™re just saying this now? Where have you been for the past year?
You all are alike. No statement on the sexual assault he bragged about committing. His words are just the worst though, huh?
Its about time someone stood up to #Rus #Putin and his mistreatment of #PussyRiot. @MikeCrapo @DavidPepper
.@MikeCrapo Or what? You're gonna unendorse him? You actually going to grow the spine to do so? Spare me your phony late-found moralism.
cc: @kennethc1689
and you'll vote for him regardless
and he must drop out. Period. Why aren't you saying this?
@politicalwire and then after his heart-felt apology they can all go back to endorsing and voting for him. Hypocrite much?
So what's it say about you if you still endorse this scum as party nominee?
Who are you voting for?
@aravosis Do you still endorse him for president?
@DonLDay And you must withdraw your endorsement.
Also should apologize to the women he assaulted, according to his brag.
@aravosis we won't hold our breath
are you still endorsing him?
News flash,dipshit. @realDonaldTrump was caught admitting 2 sexually assaulting women...raping them.No apology can fix RAPE #dick
Trump should do what every Democrat has done since Janet Reno. Just say I take full responsibility, and leave it at that
how could you endorse and vote for a man who admits laughingly to being a serial sexual predator?!?!
will you withdraw endorsement?
Who do you endorse for POTUS?
Follow the Utah leadership.
.@MikeCrapo Take the next step. Pull your support. Say he is unfit
You are right. Denounce him. I cannot vote for politics over morality and common decency. Please.
And if you really believe what you say you need to unendorse him, Senator!
