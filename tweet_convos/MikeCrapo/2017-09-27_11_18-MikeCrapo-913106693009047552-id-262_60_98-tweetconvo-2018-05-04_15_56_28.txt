How about instead we watch 'live' efforts of @realDonaldTrump and #GOP do more to help #PuertoRico? Should've had aid ready before Maria.

To bad they’ll get it done only to watch it died in your senate
@SenateGOP get it done before you get replaced!!!
Are you kidding us? Unified with whom? Certainly not @POTUS ! Pass the bills! Stop stabbing we the people in the back once and for all!!!!
Because .@realDonaldTrump has no idea what's happening from day to day and can't explain anything congress is working on.
You sure are not unified with me. BTW a 20% tax rate still keeps countries like Ireland at a competitive advantage.  Bet you negotiate to 30% too.  You are failing us.
What's the effective corp tax rate in the US? IR is also attractive because the US Tres. subsidizing investment in IR with our tax law.
Oh, Mitch, some golden oldies for your tax reform. They are still INACCURATE and you forgot to mention that it gives more money to wealthy Republican donors. 
POTUS I think its time to sit down with Mitch & change the voting rules in the senate so we can get the agenda passed. please read this
You love the filibuster when .@BarackObama was in the White House?
How you going to do that? You couldn't even Repeal Obamacare
@SenateGOP grandstanding, now get something done, you guys need to get this done!
Flat Tax
Can u say horse 
ANOTHER AWFUL PLAN BY GOP!
I don't see any black people or women in that video. Shouldn't they have some say in the "unified GOP" tax bill?

You guys are in fear for your jobs. You should be, & do the people right or The People will vote your asses out
#Kochtapus
tax breaks for the rich... and some cake for the masses. next.
Sure hope 5hey get off center and at least get this done
REPUBLS ARE LYING! THEY KNOW THEY'RE LYING! UNLESS BY LYING SO MUCH YOU START BELIEVING YOUR OWN LIES WHICH MEANS YOU'RE UNFIT 4 OFFICE!
I can't wait to watch this legislative effort implode, just like the rest of your attempts to pass legislation since taking "control".
And undo Jones Act to release gas shipments to Puerto Rico 
Screw the framework. I want details.
BullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshit! 
Repugnantcons are thieves & liars! #UGH
How do U justify an 1.6trillion increase to deficit over 10yrs. to give 1% a tax break?
Just a unified GOP? No bipartisan support? Sounds about right.
Your #TaxReform is a sham, Mitch. @gop cutting taxes for the rich so they can keep getting welfare $ from #KochBros
Trump plan appears to raise taxes by >$900 on married couples w/2 children in lower-middle class (~$45k in income) 1/6
No #TaxReform until @potus @realDonaldTrump releases his taxes. #notonepenny 
We must see how much @Trump personally benefits. #TrumpTaxes
Really?! So far pretty out of touch and ineffective.
Watching you do nothing in Puerto Rico first
here again the operative words are GOP #taxreform. WhEn will you get bipartisan?
How bout getting @realDonaldTrump to release his taxes so we see exactly how this benefits him and his biz.
you couldn't even get 51 for healthcare....you look like a beaten man in that photo!!
Raising the rates on the lowest bracket and double standard deduction? When you live paycheck to paycheck more $ later DOES NOT HELP. F off.
Your tax reform plan seems greedy and morally deficient. Please don't pass it. Please collaborate with Democrats.
I have a sinking feeling that when the math comes out, my tax bracket in the 3 will be higher than where I'm at... so I get to fund your cut
Must miss!  I don't tune in to #liars trying to spin screwing middle class while helping rich!
So we have seen the messes a unified GOP makes. How about getting a bi-partisan unification. WE TRUST NOTHING,IT IS ALWAYS FOR BIG BUSINESS
"Unified GOP". HAHAHAHAHAHA
Right til you guys vote. No Leadership in the Senate.
You misspelled unraveling.
What a joke, Mitch. Unified GOP! Prove it!
Got the Senate, House, and the WH and still can't accomplish healthcare and tax reform...perhaps time for a new leader.
sickening you could not get healthcare done for those of us,suffering
*** R E T I R E ***
#disgusting #TaxFairness #TaxReform
Tax Cuts for the rich. That's all. Screw the middle class and poor. bottom line will I pay more next year then this? Answer of course
are you tired of hearing the same thing over and over  IMAGIN THAT
Most people will not believe Republican Senate is unified until they pass some major legislation
What are you doing Mitch putting on another show for us to think you're doing something when you're not. Please resign ASAP
I don't need to watch. It was put together in private in a backroom with a lot of deals for companies and the rich. We need bipartisanship
Don't need 2 watch white men pat each other's backs because they want 2 give rich donors tax breaks. Increase taxes on rich then we'll talk.
s...all of u
So you morons sit at the Confessional dining table and opine "I think we should spend 8 mil to defeat a fellow Republican and lose"! Bravo!
I hope it goes as well as your healthcare reform.
Where was all this excitement abaout repealing Obamacare!

Full of be. You are not a republican you are a dollar sign
You are the enemy of real conservatives McConnell.  We will not forget how you and that rat Ryan treated our wonderful President.  #MAGA
Good luck
I don't see the idiot McCain standing up there! Is he going to ruin this for us too! Better get him in line quickly! WE WANT TAX CUTS NOW!
All the numbers look very familiar
We just want and demand TAX CUTS! We don't care about "reform"...WE WANT TAX CUTS! Please do not let these 3 or 4 idiot mess this up! MAGA!
Framework minus http://details.you  guys never ever learn.its comical


Don't even think about it, Paulie.  DON'T!
Furst can you make sure we get to see @realDonaldTrump's taxes? I'd like to see which loopholes to close.
.@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan  Sorry, watching unraveling of American Democracy by you & and a rabid, brain damaged orangutan. #PUERTORICO
Reform the tax code because billionaires need more money.
Really, can we believe you? You have not supported @POTUS at all! #RepealAndReplace Obamacare #BuildTheWall #RespectTheFlagAndAthem.

Let's all watch Mitch and the Republicans lie again!!!
Yep, tax cut for the wealthy, screw the rest of us...
I watch knowing something much better that could have been....
Not even a triple digit live audience. After healthcare debacle 3,  maybe we're a little jaded.
You won't be able to pass that either. You have zero leadership skills
God help you if you don't get your shit together Mitch.  I don't hate you, but I sure as hell hate your lack of leadership with #MAGA.
HELP PUERTO RICO 
You must be giving each other, your rich donors and crooked lobbyists a but load of juicy tax cuts. How will the middle class benefit?
Lies, lies & more lies. More cuts to the Middle Class and a huge tax break to the wealthiest. Typical, rich get richer poor get poorer.  Sad
CANT WAIT UNTIL @MooreSenate GETS IN THERE TO KICK YOUR ASS @TeamMoore
This caucus better not bring up any bill proposed by @SenJohnMcCain . I'm not sure why you're not demanding he resign now for lying.
Doesn't sound like tax reform, sounds like Elite BS double speak to me!
The ACA REPEAL is all that matters!
If we can't kill the poor with our healthcare bill we will make sure they stay poor with our tax bill.
Your tax plan is GARBAGE.
Can't even believe you said united!  This group can't agree on when to use the bathroom.  we will get another watered down BS bill
You should resign and retire.
Non-stop lies flowing from that chumps mouth. #Repeal&ReplaceRyan
Looks like a real circle jerk there.  Is gonna be you or Ryan who takes a shit on the stage?  #VoteOutRyan #VoteOutMcConnell #NAZItrump
End imperialistic #FATCA! End cap. "gains" #tax on #constitutional #Money/#Tender (ie, gold & silver Coin)! True #TaxReform #Taxes
Nope. No extra revenue for rich white men
You wouldn't know 'unified' if it but you in the ass

In June, Price took a Learjet 55 from DC to Nashville—a $17,760 roundtrip flight.

Commercial airline tix would have cost $102-$333/person. …
Screw your tax reform! Where are your priorities?? People are dying in Puerto Rico. Help them!!!
Yep screwing us for your rich friends again.
I can hardly wait until Mueller starts unveiling his indictments.
FYI .. You sir are going to prison ..
Why are there no women working on this?
You're not gonna get laid on Twitter dude. Try Snapchat.
Senator McConnell, can we attach a defunding measure as well? @realDonaldTrump #MAGA
Is it called “The Wonderful Ways We Can Screw Over Working Class People?”
Yay, big tax cuts for corporations and the 1% said no regular person ever.
If standard deduction is 30k, more money in my mothball wallet. Perhaps I can pay the ACA increase 4 next year. Inflation is real.
Shucks. Busy at the moment. 

#notthemainevent
Isn't one beating from Trump enough -why look for more!

Terrible
We will believe when we see it
Most ineffective Congress in history 
Bought& Sold by lobbyists,Big Pharma, Soros etc.
Exit RINOs #2018
Looks about right - no Women, no people of color. Typical
Hey Mitch! What are you doing to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns and killing 49 people?
Where is Robbin Hood we need him to help us out. The USA people and Veterans
You and your rich wife get tax cuts yay!!! Can we get YOUR insurance at least?
GOP sadly revealed what America can expect, with their health plan proposal. The callousness & greed displayed before all America. Snakes
Look at Kansas, trickle down doesn't work
Where has Mitch been (Unified GOP) ?Mitch is in outer space  or drugged
I hope it's as successful as your healthcare plan.
Just like Replace and Repeal Obama’s Care, everyone of you MUST be replaced and that will happen. You have no shame and  your a shame.
 #2018
Ill bred, low class, lying, thieving, Conservative trash trying to steal money from the working class and calling it "tax reform".
@dacullington. Tax cuts for the rich!
Unified.  You guys are a hoot.

You mean the solidification if the oligarchy v. Serf's mentality
What happened to regular order?
Resign
And I have title to my property why.I have to pay taxes to i die? ??
Tax the poor and give it to the rich? We the USA people under 250th a yr need it to. Do away with the death taxes
VA people pay over 200taxes a day9.5b on tobacco 8.5b on food 100B on gas taxes I can go on Follow the dollar Money talks and Bullshit Walks
Total bullshit!
Inteligent people are not buy your shit!
The Republican party is failing.
Your economic policy is a proven failure (Kansas)
There no proof that tax cuts increase GDP..
Where exactly are the DEMS? Did you bother to even invite them to talks? If so why isn't that invitation public? @realDonaldTrump
Are you all really unified
What an enormous turd in the punchbowl. Why don't you have a big glug, Mitch?
We'll believe it when we see it.
Here we go again. #resist
Yeah pat yourself on the back you bunch of slackers won't even be able to pass this as long as McCain is on your side, Drain The Swamp Mitch
I wanna watch our citizens in Puerto Rico STAY ALIVE... do something
All citizens get to vote but only 51% pay taxes, there should be a flat tax for everyone,
Unified GOP - don't believe. No faith in passing POTUS' tax reform. Can leadership approval ratings get any lower??
Ryan and Micky delusional  obstructionist Corporation writing this 15% for 6 corporations and 25 to 38% for working people. NonObjective
@SpeakerRyan YOU LIAR! Whenever Mitch is standing behind you DROOLING!!!  It's not good for the American People only the RICH!  
Not a good plan Mitch we the middle class are getting screwed over again
NO TAX REFORM UNTIL WE SEE TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS. #GOPCOVERUP #DIRTYGOP
You did he paid more talk to Rachel
Bye Bot.
Your constitution is Citizens United. ALEC 6 corps writes for profit legislation and bark sedition and obstruction
@SenateGOP Note -it takes 1400 sm biz to add 10 jobs ea -to equal 1 big 24-7 mfg
More lies from the liars. You ALL had 7 years of campaigning on repeal Obamacare and when the chance came, you had to admit your lies.

Congress is getting ready to do….nothing, Tell them you want #taxreform #FAIRtax #MTFA http://FAIRtax.org/petition  then call then 202-224-3121 
You have nothing again bcuz you don't work for people

Stop the lies! This is not reform it's transfer of wealth to your pocket. I prefer static cling and herpes to anything you propose.
Gross.
