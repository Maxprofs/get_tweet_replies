.@SenJohnMcCain Go fuck yourself and your fanatical fake filibusters! (27 of 45)
@SenJohnMcCain @jonzies 
Kick his ass, John!
@SenJohnMcCain you mean like the GOP did in the House? Govt shutdown. Changed the rules so only Cantor could bring a vote to the floor.
.@SenJohnMcCain Now will you "moderates" wake up and fight an obvious enemy? #ColdCivilWar
@Melvin_Udall_ @SenJohnMcCain Why do you assume McCain views dems as enemy? They are more alike than different.
@bstevewhite I don't. @SenJohnMcCain is the enemy. "build the dang fence" He's a lying oligarch dinosaur.
@SenJohnMcCain
E.g., If a class rule is that you can go to the bathroom whenever you want, and you do it every 5 min...the rule will change
@SenJohnMcCain that must stink knowing your good buddies on the left did that to you
he also opposed the New Deal MT @SenJohnMcCain Arthur Vandenberg said if majority of Senate can change the rules, "there are no rules"
@SenJohnMcCain @font4842 
Democrat playbook 
Rule #1: no rules. Power is the Only objective
Rule#2: blame Bush
@SenJohnMcCain there isn't any difference between you and any of the dens.  You're all in it for yourselves.  Loser!
@SenJohnMcCain Senator, if the GOP had particip[ated in governing instead of preventing it, none of this would have happened. #Blameyourself
@SenJohnMcCain One Republican threaten to elect more Judges like Thomas, that was a bully threat , he sound like a bully to me , bring it on
@SenJohnMcCain @Melvin_Udall_ you didn't help when you fought against @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul
@mng2mala @Melvin_Udall_ @SenJohnMcCain @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul  @SenJohnMcCain says nothing I want to hear - he doesn't speak conservative
@AVerebely I agree. John McCain is no Conservative. He is something between moderate & liberal Democrat
@SenJohnMcCain Well said friend
@SenJohnMcCain See what Truman's generals warned about in 1948 re: your traitorous support of Israel. Prophetic! http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article24624.htm …
@SenJohnMcCain sorry, but more filibusters have been used against this potus than any other. #Enoughisenough
So what did they say in 75? MT @SenJohnMcCain As Sen Vandenberg said in 49: If a majority can change rules at any time, "there are no rules"
@SenJohnMcCain @clearfieldking how does it feel that knife in your back from across the isle ?
@SenJohnMcCain The minority already changed the rules! Your stupidity is painful to watch. #RetireGramps
@SenJohnMcCain @MikeCrapo Has the ability to stand and speak a filibuster been removed? Or the ability to sit/secret instead of standing?
@SenJohnMcCain it is 2013, not 1949.  Senate needs to work not grandstand.
@SenJohnMcCain that's ridiculous. It's the GOP's actions that forced this to even be an issue.
@SenJohnMcCain @jonzies S'matter senator, the Gang of Eight turn their back on you?  You been played: again.
@SenJohnMcCain So how is your good buddy, Harry Reid.  Giving him a slap on the back for his audacity?
@SenJohnMcCain @jonzies So where the hell where you?
@SenJohnMcCain @jonzies You have your head so far up the dems asses that you make no sense criticizing them. We see right through you
@SenJohnMcCain If a minority just filibusters EVERYTHING, we get nothing done. #NuclearProgress
@SenJohnMcCain How is that bipartisanship working out for you?
@SenJohnMcCain No their are rules , but the Republicans doesn't know how to follow them.
@SenJohnMcCain thanks for vacillating that along. You & your cross the aisle and give up on principle thing. Thanks for helping destroy USA
@SenJohnMcCain @LaurieBailey Look for the best, double-talking Fascist and Marxist Judges for confirmation; it’s a done deal now!
@SenJohnMcCain @LaurieBailey Oh.  Now, after kissing Fascist Party glute for years, Juan McCainez is telling us how it is.  Get lost, John.
@SenJohnMcCain @dannowicki Because, clearly, majority rule is anti-American. #ifthepresidentisaDemocrat
@SenJohnMcCain I guess you no longer believe in your Gang of 14 agreement to filibuster only under extraordinary circumstances
.@SenJohnMcCain It's unfortunate you could not work with your Democrat "good friends" to stop this #nuclearoption. One-way friendship?
So reaching across the aisle isn't working after all? I thought they were your friends! http://archive.redstate.com/blogs/spiral/2008/jan/17/mccain_praises_democrats_while_bashing_republicans … @SenJohnMcCain
@SenJohnMcCain @RJCHQ You're a little late, Senator. What did you think would happen when you gave O political cover? He'd waste it?
@SenJohnMcCain You're part of the probllem, Weakness & spinless political behavior for the thugs you're dealing is too much. Please retire
@SenJohnMcCain You helped build this. Are they Still "Your Friends". But Yet You will Bash Conservatives. Keep Crossing that Aisle.
@SenJohnMcCain the #nuclearoption is a real problem. I appreciate that you've been on the correct side of this debate w/ Dem & GOP majs.
@SenJohnMcCain Dictator Obama has now taken his throne. I am still in shock.
@SenJohnMcCain If Republicans could have gotten on the same page this might not have never come about. Obama has complete control now.
@SenJohnMcCain You willing to call Harry Reid a "wacko-bird" or is that just reserved for conservatives?
@SenJohnMcCain All your cozying up and cover you provided to your friends across the aisle sure paid off.
@SenJohnMcCain STFU McCain
@SenJohnMcCain and if you continually filibuster almost everything, there is no senate...
@SenJohnMcCain You are a coward for not standing up to this. You Republicans deserve exactly what you get. Go ahead...blame the Tea Party.
@SenJohnMcCain A super majority assumes a bi-partisan will to act 4 nation.Today's GOP looks like it wants to whip an uppity black Pres.
@SenJohnMcCain The dysfunction has gone beyond the pale. It is now a question of self-inflicted harm to whole nation.Where arethe statesmen?
@SenJohnMcCain From GOP view,nothing BO does or could do can be good enough.The malice is too extreme.This hate is perhaps unique.
@SenJohnMcCain oh get to work John now you only need 51 Votes to Repeal Obamacare...you all can do this. Make Sen Reid see his mistake!
@SenJohnMcCain @Red__Rover As I understand it, any Senator can put an indefinite hold on any nominee,right?
@SenJohnMcCain And you are aware that the extremists tried to blow up a refinery in Russia ? http://news.progorodchelny.ru/news/view/72168 
.@SenJohnMcCain Filibusters are for bullies with nothing to say, only taxpayers' money to waste. Shut up and create some damn jobs. #Fail
@SenJohnMcCain Sure there is, called 'majority rules', tempered by reasonable opposition,- signed, on of YOUR supporters (but GOP no longer)
Majority changing to majority-rule rule. MT @SenJohnMcCain If a majority of the Senate can change the rules at any time, there are no rules.
Save it a**hole...you live to aid tyranny.@SenJohnMcCain @CherylRenetteBa
@SenJohnMcCain Get off your high horse and at least TRY to save what is left of this country.
@SenJohnMcCain what up with the bottled water in the cover photo... lmao
@SenJohnMcCain they need to vote on term limits! Go retire
@SenJohnMcCain we can only hope to gain the senate
@SenJohnMcCain 

Funny.  You would do the same thing if rules were reversed.  You totally abused the Filibuster.  You get what you deserve.
@SenJohnMcCain You have no right to complain. Senate GOP brought it upon themselves by requiring 60 votes to debate ANYTHING.
@SenJohnMcCain, y'all should have seen this coming, being the so-called "party of no" these past several years.  You reap what you sow.
@senjohnmccain Tell your Connecticut pals to NOT use CT probate lawyer Frank Leone if they don't want to stalked, lied 2 & discriminated
@SenJohnMcCain at least the majority rules.
@SenJohnMcCain yeah, gotta be careful once you are not in the majority anymore!
@SenJohnMcCain and what do you do about it? Go kiss Harry's ass?  Not surprised, u old RINO has-been traitor! We Love Cruz & you're envious
@SenJohnMcCain Flat-ass stupid. You jokers brought this on yourselves through five years of intransigence. #overplayedhands
@SenJohnMcCain 

Is there a clause in @SenatorReid "Nuclear Option" rule change that make it null & void if (when) Republicans take over?
@SenJohnMcCain Watch, now Senate Democrats will vote down filibuster rule before 2016 elections so if GOP wins they can't have same power.
@SenJohnMcCain Hey the House did it to keep from voting on opening the gov back in August. Changed the rules.
@SenJohnMcCain I'm amused by all the response which seem to forget the period between 2001 and 2007...
.@SenJohnMcCain Maybe you'll learn all this "statesman" talk is crap. Working with Harry Reid is dealing with the devil.
#tcot
@SenJohnMcCain I guess its OK to abuse the rules. Under LBJ 1 filibuster.  Under Obama over 600. But thats OK, right?
@SenJohnMcCain totally agree. Not a good move.
@SenJohnMcCain you should have stopped your party from going over the edge. The GOP is earning its 9% approval.
@SenJohnMcCain Unfortunately, you weren't there with a gang of 14 stopping filibuster abuse this time #nuclearoption
@SenJohnMcCain Wow John, I found something I agree with you on...
.@SenJohnMcCain @StarzandStrypz So quit being a RINO and fight the tyrannic rule of #Obama and the #Democrats.
@SenJohnMcCain then majority rule. Win an election.
@SenJohnMcCain "YOU BETRAYED THE WHITE RACE, YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR COUNTRY IN FAVOR OF PARASITES FROM AFRICA....Nice going Mac." :Duke
@SenJohnMcCain" 759,000 WHITES KILLED BY BLACKS IN THE US EVERY YR AND MC CAIN WANTS TO SHOWER THESE KILLERS WITH BILLIONS!!"said Dr Manning
@SenJohnMcCain and if republican senators would govern instead of being nothing more then obstructionists, then this wouldnt have happened!
.@SenJohnMcCain "Nuclear option: < of a change, > of a restoration of how Senate used 2 - and was designed 2 - work http://on.msnbc.com/1bUUvsC "
@SenJohnMcCain and if a minority of the senate can stop all business there is no senate.
@SenJohnMcCain Very disappointing and an illustration of a broken system.
@SenJohnMcCain This is about your party blocking every single bloody nomination because you hate this President.
@SenJohnMcCain If the Republicans can obstruct on everything there is no governing.
@SenJohnMcCain you're all the absolute worst
