.@MikeCrapo Stand up to the NRA. Automatic weapons are made for military use only! #GunControlNow
Exactly! That's why they are already illegal to the public. NRA doesn't fight for right to have automatic weapons...
The real concern is, how are these automatic weapons in the public? And if it's a military only gun, who in the military is selling them?!
They're legal to sell to civilians but shouldn't be.
Legal to sell to who? You in USA ? Automatic weapons are not legal anywhere here to civilians
Semi auto's are sold in USA with background check
Yes semi auto is ..and always will be. But never will an insane psychopath be able to trot into a gun store and buy that machine gun he used
Here’s a great way to fight evil: give back the $ the @NRA gave you and work for #GunControlNow
Is this true? Idaho Senator Mike Crapo received $4,950 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle?
One way to unify Americans. Stop taking money from the NRA, it's disgusting how purchased you GOP members are.
bloody money
Too bad you're  beholden to the NRA #emptythoughtsfullpockets
You made your statement when you took $4,950 from the NRA last election cycle. No further comment needed.
You voted against the assault weapons ban. 
Your words mean nothing.
AWB is meaningless at this point.
What does this even mean? Translation: I will do nothing of substance to prevent this from happening again because I am beholden to the NRA.
Hollow words after your H.J. Res 40 vote. You have no honor.
you took $5K from NRA! Spare us the bullshit! YOU ARE COMPLICIT IN THIS! There is blood on your hands.
Nice response. Now do something about it! You’re in a position to make a change. Start by pulling back S.59.
Now, get off your 'duff' and do something about it!
Sir, we've been mourning and remembering since Columbine. How about legislating and protecting? #NRA #LasVegas
You know what else "threatens our sense of security?" The GUN SILENCERS YOU'RE TRYING TO NORMALIZE, you DICK
Idaho Senator Mike Crapo received $4,950 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
Please fight to ban automatic weapons. Do something about this or are we going to continue to do nothing.. Again!
Please fight for increased gun control.
Responsible #GunContolNow !
"May we unite..." blah, blah, blah. You know another GREAT idea? How about NOT accepting $4,950 from the NRA, as you did in 2016? You have blood on YOUR hands.
I have a good way to fight evil. Stop sucking the #NRA's dick and pass legislation to prevent this.
Love it
I like to get drunk off wine and troll politicians on Twitter. I'm pretty sure I'm using it right!
How about some gun control legislation. That would be better than tweeting platitudes. #GunControlNow
None of this ends unless you do something to stop it!!!!!!
let's start uniting by not taking NRA $ and by coming together to enact reasonable gun control laws
Stop taking NRA Lobby money- no automatic weapons

your "solidarity" with the victims would be much better spent resisting the NRA 's money & taking action now!
Idaho Senator Mike Crapo received $4,950 from the #NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
It is time for you to step up and DO something! #GunContolNow
What is the evil in this Las Vegas case, that you will fight against, Hon. Mike Crapo?
may you please also send the NRA their money back. or better yet donate it to save lives. thank you.
Idaho Senator Mike Crapo received $4,950 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
You can best honor those who lost their lives in Las Vegas by showing leadership and sponsoring common-sense gun laws. Be a hero.

And some sensible gun laws.
their blood is on your hands. You took $from the NRA in 2016. WE NEED MORE GUN CONTROL... do your job.
Idaho Senator Mike Crapo received $4,950 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
El Crapo .... $4,950 from the NRA and counting
Vote NO on the #shareact. If you don't, I'll donate to your opponent in your next campaign.
Well, they would all rather that you send $4950 back to the NRA.
Yo how much money have you taken from the NRA? Let’s see some actually action. Hi
Stand up to the NRA, Senator. Guns are killing innocent civilians every day in the US.
Cars Are Killing People Everyday ..Do You Want Laws Against People Driving Also ??
We need sensible gun control. Semi and fully automatic weapons do not need to be in the hands of civilians! CDA, ID resident

may you unite with the American people in changing the laws that lead to this. #enough
Your next payment is coming! Big thumbs up from @NRA. The expect to get what they paid for. Don't forget who owns you.
How did you spend your NRA blood money, @MikeCrapo? A nice vacation? I hope it was worth all those innocent lives. #BloodOnYourHands
Idaho Senator Mike Crapo received $4,950 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
$4,950
$4,950 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
Vote this blood money taking fool out!!!!! Should be a special place in hell for the #GOP they are the going to kill us all!
You are in a position to make real change.  Stop mourning and lead.
Your statement is accurate, except for the part leaving out a call for an assault weapons ban. Give NRA $ back, hypocrite.
You sponsored a silencer bill.  I am not anti-gun, I am anti-stupidity. I moved out of Idaho because of the politics.
You speak of peace and condolences but your actions say otherwise. $4950 @NRA contribution smear your words Senator. #Shame #bloodmoney
Senator Mike Crapo received $4,950 from the NRA
You're a fraud
Saw you on Jimmy Kimmel last night as one of 56 senators who voted against closing gun loopholes. https://youtu.be/ruYeBXudsdss  shame!
We need laws protecting us, #GunRegulations
what your vote to weaken gun laws and support the NRA are the reality.. this fluff piece has nothing to do with reality
Idaho $enator Mike Crapo received $4,950 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle. $0 MUCH FOR HI$ PRAYER$
Cool story, why don't you explain the $4,950 you got from the @NRA for you reelection? Your actions speak louder than words Senator.
Maybe we should start with people who are bribed by the NRA to ignore regulations that make it harder to purchase guns???
Please do something, this has to stop.
You don't get to say that after accepting $4,950 from the NRA in the 2016 election cycle.
Vote NO to HR3668 and HR38. Eliminating silencers to protect hunters ears and banning conceal and carry laws is NOT the way to go.
Stop taking NRA money. Stand up to them and we won’t have to grieve so much. Get it?
You received $4,950 fr @NRA last yr. R U donating that $$ to #LasVagasShooting families? Or help @GLOCKInc @SmithWessonCorp @sigsauerinc
https://www.facebook.com/colbertlateshow/videos/1237791963032219/ …
You dirty, naughty boy. NRA pimp will turn u out if you cross them. Bend over. Like that!  Like that! Like that! Oh yeah, like that!!!
Idaho Senator Mike Crapo received $4,950 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
I see you were on @JimmyKimmelLive last night. https://youtu.be/ruYeBXudsds  If word at the best you can do, we need a new Senator #VegasStrong
If words are the best you can do, then we need a new Senator*
Idaho Senator Mike Crapo received $4,950 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
Will you support common sense legislation or did the NRA buy you with 4950 pieces of silver? Your constituents are watching what you sponsor
Idaho Senator Mike Crapo received $4,950 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.

Mike, does that fight include banning automatic weapons?
Now is not the time to talk about silencers.
Fucking pathetic response. Time to man up, El Crapo.
Was it a selfless act when you accepted $4,950 from the NRA? YOU sought to destroy our sense of security when you voted AGAINST gun laws.
Long-time Idahoan w/outdoorsman father would like to see monitoring of large ammunition purchases. That is a huge red flag.
You are full of crapo. You took money from the NRA. Your votes helped this happen. You have blood on your hands.
Let me fix this tweet for u: I will help pass #GunControl to save lives because one dead American due to gun violence is too many. #LasVegas
I hope you enjoy your $5k in #BloodMoney from the NRA! #LasVegasShooting #GunControlNow
Close gun buying loop holes- period.
Why did u accept NRA $? Is this apology crap or do u support automatic guns & silencers? Pls do what's right & pass safer gun laws.
You could start by refusing gun lobby money and supporting legislation that would prevent these atrocities. #bloodmoney #GunControlNow
Why are citizens allowed to purchase weapons, where the sole intent is to kill a human being?
I'm pretty sure people are not hunting deer with those things...
Next time try not taking $4, 950 from the NRA to support your campaign. #BloodOnYourHands #LasVegasShooting #guncontrol #NRAKills #NRA
BLOOD IS ON UR HANDS.
So, what's your solution to making the US a safer place?
POLICY helps. Tweeting "thoughts & prayers" and accepting $4,950 from NRA does not. Enough is enough! NOW is the time to talk about change.
Bought and paid for by the NRA....thoughts and prayers are empty platitudes. Time for actual common sense gun control legislation
I will commend you if you don't accept $4950 from the NRA like you did last year. Make THAT statement.
James 2:20
You took $4,950 of blood money from the NRA.  Your soul was really cheap.
How much money did you accept from the NRA? Almost $5k in 2016?
Sir, you are in the position to make a difference. No military weapons...hunting fine... but no assault weapons
Nobody gives a Crapo about your empty statement. You value NRA money over human lives. You're a human toilet. #LasVegasMassacre
Your prayers won't bring anyone back. Time to do your job and pass meaningful gun control

So was the $4,950 you got from the NRA last election cycle worth it?
I too mourn it would be helpful if you did not take $4,950 from the NRA as you did in 2016 #guncontrol
Save your lousy and hollow prayers. The majority of Americans want  sensible gun laws but  you sold us out for a $5,000 donation from the  @NRA. That's less than  $100 per human life lost in Vegas.
Hollow platitudes. Return the NRA blood money you accepted. Promote gun control legislation.
Really? Like you didn't know something like this would happen as you took money from the NRA for your campaign. #LasVegasStrong
Save your thoughts. Stop taking blood money from the @NRA start fighting for stricter gun laws!
Maybe you should take the $4,950 you got from the NRA and clean your #BloodStainedHands by paying for someone's medical bills. #GFY
You know what destroys our sense of security? LACK OF SENSIBLE GUN CONTROL!!! #DoSomething!
You took $ from the @NRA, so YOU are complicit in these murders.
Idaho Senator Mike Crapo received $4,950 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
Cliches on thoughts and prayers as GOP set to favor NRA-backed legislation on gun silencers. Then accuse others of "politicizing" the issue.
How @ instead of your empty prayers u send that $4950 you received in 2016 from the NRA to a fund 4 the victim's families #LasVegasShooting
I don't see how you can drive for peace when the NRA donated 4950 to your 16 campaign and you want everyone to have silencers.
Blood is on your hands for taking money and supporting terrorist @NRA
Being nice and praying isnt going to solve this. But hey, we haven't tried #GunControl Maybe ditch that $4k NRA donation & try something new

Your statement is meaningless as long as you keep taking NRA money and voting in their interest. Try DOING SOMETHING, Mike.
Please use this to ban assault rifles from civilian sale - I know you  the NRA but civilians don’t EVER need assault rifles!!
