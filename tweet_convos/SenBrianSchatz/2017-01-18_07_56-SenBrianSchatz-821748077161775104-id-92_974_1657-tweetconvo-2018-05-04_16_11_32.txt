Trump is a spoiled brat w/no sense! NO to all his cabinet picks!!NO TO TRUMP!
#ImpeachTrump
Senator as someone who voted for you and who you represent I'm asking for you to impeach Trump for unconstitutional acts
Your twitter profile says you wish to ban Islam and Muslims, right @jd_Constitution?  Makes it pretty easy to ignore your "opinions".
You voted for every one of Trump appointees- I am scheduling a meeting with your office-get ready.
Donald didn't pick a cabinet he picked a criminal syndicate. 
maybe tell Senate Democrats while you're at it...
Very odd rationalization of why you voted 'yes' for someone who's OK with torture. Needing 3 GOP has nothing to do with it.
Thank you for looking out for your constituency!
BRAVO!
thank you for your commitment to #VoteNoDevos !

THANK YOU! STAND STRONG WE ARE WITH YOU!
Thank you for your late nights and for fighting for civil rights!
Follow your conscience on DeVos like @SenatorCollins and @lisamurkowski

Mahalo @SenBrianSchatz for your leadership on this matter.
Yes.  The vote is GREEN.  And we HOPE that our grandchildren will be able to ask how we stood!
Thank you thank you thank you!
PLEASE! This is the least of it at the moment.
Please stop wasting the money we pay you by being such an obstructionist.
We have enough disturbed ppl in this cab do not allow more EPA very imp dept
#ScottPruitt FILIBUSTER
Heard your "explanation" for Pompeo vote. Are seriously using "sanity" NOT qualifications for approval? Seriously flawed !
After your performance on All In tonight, I cant' trust you. You think you're helping by voting to confirm? LOLOLOL. Sucker.
Saw you on @allinwithchris list the Trump cabinet picks necessary to reject..please add 1 who should be denied> #Sessions
Thank you Senator!! Of all Trump's cabinet picks #ScottPruitt is the most crucial to reject. Earth First! #ClimateChange
Thank you Senator. Please continue to bring injustice to task. We must resist this America
I respectfully ask that you boycott the Trump inauguration, Kapu
Don't you worry about who I vote for
@SenSchumer ***Why not, the rest of us don't believe in that crap. Climate is cyclical, it's just that simple.
Too bad there is so much proof that Man is not controlling the weather. You just want another way to extort money from us.
@ClimateReality might be a bit late with this call out
Thank you
trump is a  Pyschopathic Personality Disorder with 7 MORE disorder traits than Hitler. LOOK IT Up!!Dysfuctional sick conman!
Thank you Senator Schatz for standing up against EPA nominee Scott Pruitt. #PollutingPruitt #RejectPruitt

#DemHypocrisy
@SenateGOP We want someone leading the Environmental Protection Agency who actually believes in environmental protection.
Great! Hope you feel as strongly about the inauguration and join House colleagues!
40 years we were worrying about global cooling
40 years ago, SCIENCE wanted to melt the Arctic to save us from global cooling  @Newsweek http://denisdutton.com/newsweek_coolingworld.pdf … 
Ty for being my voice & poignant bullet points of why @RepTomPrice should NOT be confirmed! Horrible for healthcare. Scary.
@SenateDems when you get China and India to do as much as America for global warming then you can come talk to me
Don't Elect natural climate cycle deniers.  Sun cycles 24-27 end brief mild thaw out of coldest era of past 8K yrs
your missing something big: @ScottPruitt used taxpayer $ to further his political ambitions
watched you BLATANTLY LIE on @MSNBC. RNC will NOT Cut medicare or Soc Sec. U & the Dems LIE #YULOST U need to be VOTED OUT
ummmm pencil neck.. @TheDemocrats lost
stop Pruitt! Climate cannot take another climate change de denier
@SenateDems Don't voye for Climate Change Denier! In Yorkville, Illinois,  having warmest winter ever!!
I appreciate the sentiment, but shouldn't it be climate CHANGE denier?
@SenSchumer global warming is part of the globalists agenda which was voted out Nov. 8!
@SenateDems right let's vote for a idiot who admits it
@DSenFloor @EPA @EPAblog @EPAwater @EPAresearch @EPAregion2 @EPAregion3 @EPAlive @EPAgreenbldg @TheDemocrats @Local4News H2O
@SenSchumer the @gop hates the enviroment.They rather give taxcuts to rich & have no checks on corp. than protect our planet

thank you, Senator.
Go ride a tsunami, fool
@SenateDems exactly!!
He does not support animal welfare either. Pls vote no! #RiggedCabinet #notmypresident #boycotttheinauguration
"climate change is not all man made" - Climate Change Denial, Stage 2.

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/sep/16/climate-change-contrarians-5-stages-denial …
Yep, Climate Change Denial Stage 2 diagnosis confirmed.
The great Dan Rather who ran that false report on Bush 43 #fakenews
Thank you sir 
@SenateDems He owns stock in fossil fuel companies, how the hell does this pass as right?
You up for re-election 2018? Hopefully.
The GOP are all deniers, whether climate, racism, or economic disparity. They'll vote for a denier every time
who cares what your message is we do not even know you
Thank you Senator Schatz
Must be a need for all the Climate Change Rhetoric from Democrats against Trump's pick.
@SenSchumer My message to the American people . How can you vote for an Idiot that believes humans can control the climate ?
Climate Change is a total Hoax!

Reject Chuckie !
its a sad sad thing to point out, but look at all the empty seats behind him.
That is sad.. some people refuse to act or do anything uncomfortable until they are forced to.
