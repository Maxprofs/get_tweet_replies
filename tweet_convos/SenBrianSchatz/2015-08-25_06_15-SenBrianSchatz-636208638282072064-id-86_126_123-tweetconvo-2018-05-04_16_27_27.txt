@CNN @SenBrianSchatz " Anchor Babies Away "
@CNN Just give a Republican a microphone and watch them hang themselves!

@CNN china, birth is at conception. usa birth is a delivery. so they anchor are two citizens bye law!!!  revolution coming...
@CNN This is happening left and right out here in California! They lie on their visas about being pregnant.have their babies and go home!
@CNN When you look at investigative reports on TV they show this massive production line of Asian in hotels delivering in the usa as anchors

@CNN WHAT A DOPE
@CNN I thought it impossible that Rs would do worse with Asians in 2016 (they went D more than Latinos in 2012), but maybe not?
@CNN time for him to exit stage left..
@CNN who are these political aspirants ?? Like how do they make these comments ? Are they really politicians ? I now think Biden should run.
“@CNN: Jeb Bush ignited a firestorm with his “anchor babies” comment, saying it’s related to Asians.

@CNN The term Anchor baby is objective w/o any racial reference. The left media insists adding "color" to it. They're the true racists.
@CNN don't need another bush
@CNN Jeb is a chump
@CNN These types of comment's are said by a few Republicans but believed by all of them and their Red State citizens love them for it.
@CNN He's an alien send him back to the planet he came from.
@CNN soo? The term "anchor babies"isn't referring to wolfs kids?
@CNN  That makes it better (sarcasm). He's only saying that now because there are few enough Asians to not cost him an election.
@CNN #Election2016 just keeps getting better and better....
@CNN @lishaarino So much for the Asian vote.
@CNN  check out the Asian American response at #MyAsianAmericanStory
When you are a shameless pander-pants, these are the troubles you run into. @CNN
@CNN how dare you!!!! Monster!!!!!!!
@CNN he's sounding more like George everyday! I wonder how good he is @ ducking from flying boots?!?
@CNN this story and immigration so much talk just like refried beans
@CNN @realDonaldTrump @JebBush  sad but the the time has come to accept that your candidacy has gone from anchor babies to just anchored.
@CNN 
Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt ~ Abraham Lincoln
@CNN Jeb needs to stop trying so hard. His efforts are looking unnatural & desperate, like he's trying to be one of the cool kids in school.
@CNN Illegals use children as a sympathy card hoping to get a free pass.
@CNN Open mouth - insert foot - repeatedly
@CNN So everyone crossing the Mexican border will be exempt? #NoMoreBush
@CNN this is getting so good. So many SNL moments to come!
@CNN not ready for prime time
@CNN nuovo Bush nuova guerra ...gira la ruota
@CNN Po'Reds. Jeb Their Only Hope...
@CNN The country is getting more stupider listening to these idiots...
@LangeB1 @CNN Those Idiots Brought All The Crazies Out From Under The Doublewides They Were 1864 Living Under. Reds, WANT Extremists...
