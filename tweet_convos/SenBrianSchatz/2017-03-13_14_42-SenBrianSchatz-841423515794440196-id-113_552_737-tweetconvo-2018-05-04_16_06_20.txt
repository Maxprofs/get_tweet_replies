/ but as long as they are in power they will continue to push regime change in Washington

@JudyJones1990 when Trump promised healthcare at a fraction of the cost he meant coverage for a fraction of the people
/ funny 
@RepGoodlatte  Republicans think Americans are stupid.  This plan is a train wreck.
@markwarner trump is right on target, lie,lie, lie. say if often enough and his low intellect followers bow and kiss ass. UGH
Same old boring Demo hysterical attack on Trump before the final version is released.
/ what final version ???  Rump has not offered any version of healthcare because "it very complicated "
@MarkWarner hahahaha wait when did Shroomer and Piglisi become credible?
omg! He lied!?! No!?! Surely not!?!  sadly his voters will keep believing his lies. Until they, friends, family start dying
Think so?  I'm waiting
according to facts, yes, I do think so. Good luck.
Janice Wolf is probably a bot.
And everyone who will probably be in that 24 million voted for him.

original source location?
your mom
@mediccaptfm just because everyone has access doesn't mean they will be able to afford it.
@realDonaldTrump Trump is a pathological liar. He never tells the truth-why would we expect truth on healthcare? TrumpcareKills
Did we expect any less from the Liar in Chief?
@potus just one question - why in the world is uninsuring so many Americans even on the table? I am ashamed, angry &embarrassed
trump is a Liar, Liar pants on fire, as always. Said it just to get votes. 4th political theory. EAT THE ELEPHANT
"Trumpcare" is misleading.  Perhaps it should be called "TrumpDoesn'tCare."
@MarkWarner And people wondered why I cried when I saw the election results.
not all are covered now, to costly, fines are cheaper.  Our insurance has more then doubled
Illegals will no longer have a free ride. Throw them out.
they don't have one now. Facts are your friend.
@MarkWarner
If that is the case you people need to meet and do your job for all the people. What we have now seems to be wanting.
@MarkWarner how many of 24 million are simply those who choose not to buy it?
/ really the only reason P Ryan wants this is because he will look  stupid if he doesn't do something..he's going to look worse
He probably thinks it's everyone who matters
most hurt by trumpcare could be children - disabled - elderly & voter base
@MarkWarner He was joking you silly ppl! Can't you tell when @POTUS makes a funny? You know, like when he said Obama tapped him
@MarkWarner No one can believe ANYTHING Donald J Trump speaks. He is a CON. He compulsively lies through his teeth #LIARINCHIEF
@MarkWarner In what circumstance can anyone believe anything that comes from Trump administration? Dangerous.
@reDQlus doing what he does best, lie lie lie! Wake up america, the donald is the worst thing that has ever happened to america!
@RepNewhouse 
How is this better?  I demand you come home and hold a town hall to explain to us why this is better?
and only idiots believed and voted for him.
@realDonaldTrump @VP @GOP @SenateDems @CNN @FoxNews @AP @politico @PressSec WH-So which is it, everyone will be covered or have access only
Someone should have said "You lie!" when he addressed Congress & said that. Will you say it the next time he addresses Congress?

Whadda ya mean uninsured? God insures all us believers.
THANKS Trump, Ryan, GOP.. Even 10 Million Without is to many

This is AMERICA, I Realize U Don't Care if  SUFFER or DIE.
Instead of pissing and moaning, why don't you guys work with the rest of congress to get something passed that would benefit the people?
Of course ya'll didn't do anything to improve AHCA, so why would you worry about a new system? Just piss and moan!!  #worthlesspoliticians
are those the same 24million that weren't covered until Obamacare forced us to pay for it?
@SpeakerRyan is a Writer of Republican Health Plan Bill. Call Your Congress and Senator to Vote No On Republican Health Bill.
@SenMarkey Yeah those who opt out that didn't want it to begin with. And medicaid needs to get rolled back big league.
not if they pay for it like everyone else!
@realDonaldTrump is a pathological liar! #Resistance
@lajacks13 looks like mr.negotiator isn't so great. Can't stand up to Ryan and back voters.
He is aware and is still pushing it--now lets see if congress has a backbone or not!
Dumbasses there are two phases that were not scored!
health care is not a right. Government should not be in the health care business!!
@CNN @SenateDems Many Trump voters will get it the kisser on their insurance and FINALLY realize what they did.
What a lie... everyone will have access to affordable health care... people choose to buy or not buy... stop hating Americans
#trumpsaliar #trumpcare
thanks for calling it #Trumpcare   Showing all it does not care for those in most need
#trumptruth
@SpeakerRyan your bill sucks and it terrible
Just another lie! We need Medicare for all With basic plan or Advantage plans through ins co as seniors buy now. Drug plan opt.
He probably was using "air quotes" when he said it, so it didn't have to be the truth.
How do Americans know when the @POTUS is lying? When his lips are moving. #TrumpDontCare #TrumpRussiaCollusion #TheResistance
Stand from against #Trumpcare & #DonTheCon
more lies,  more lies
this is just evil!
Surprise! Trump is a pathological liar! I for one am shocked. Shocked, I tell you! 
oh, @realDonaldTrump lied? Shocking.
#Wealthcare
@realDonaldTrump and @SpeakerRyan @speaker will call this "fake news" too. You must #resist them and #ProtectOurCare, @SenateDems!
@Lawrence Trump"s health plan: cut 337 billion from health care give himself & big business unregulated tax cuts.
"Everyone" to .@realDonaldTrump does not include real people. You know, the rich. He doesn't realize/care "other" people exist.
it will be nice to see a fraction of these 24 million Americans in Washington DC haunting the walls of the congress.
Trump said,he "Loves The Non Educated" The not only deny "Science"in Climate change,now they add Math to the mix on healthcare!
Might want to explain how the CBO can see into the future so everyone can get that Crystal Ball?
isn't the objective to get everyone health care??? @HouseGOP Republican
REPEAL & don't replace. No place for government! @TheDemocrats @DemGovs @HouseDemocrats @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan @CNN
and do many people were idiotic to believe him. How do you believe a liar?
Lie lie lie...quit lying...ppl who don't want it won't have to buy it...be honest u hacks.
This is utter #communism. When are you commies going to learn that communism WILL NOT work?#BringBackCapitalism
@SpeakerRyan 
Pathetic leadership..
It's appalling  the richestmost advanced country in the world cares so little forhealth of it's sick,elderly  and poor.
you should be glad Trumps been doin all the work for you.
Is that true? Only 11million even have obamacare to lose. #FakeNewsAlert #FactCheck #demslie #liars #propaganda #lies #lying
11 million on ACA but then Medicaid expansion (also in ACA) is rolled back and capped after 2019 so figures right
@realDonaldTrump trump promised everyone would have health coverage, great coverage and cheaper-&taxes he lied

LOL and what did dems promise with ObamaCare that isn't happening? You guys are so hypocritical!
- thank you once again Trump 4 SCREWING over the LITTLE GUY & rewarding your cronies & swamp creature friends
GOD   HELP   YOU
everyone will be free to go get whatever they want. #repealObamaCare
where  are these crazy Dems! getting this figure? I want proof! Because Dems always Lie!!!
Many uncovered as they can not afford to buy insurance and now will lose tax returns as fines.
"24 million 'MORE' Americans uninsured"...not 24 million...24 million MORE.
he's probably never going to leave town either! #grifterinchief
and now America's learning the value of @POTUS 's word = ZERO
@realDonaldTrump he is a liar promised his taxes and everyone health insurance- liar
that's being unkind to decent hard-working liars....
whatever you Do to the least of me you Done in the rest


Obamacare vs. Trumpcare 
- am sure Trump will say the photos were photoshopped
