@whitehouse How about the climate of fear you've created by your unconstitutional government spying program(s)?
"@JustinRaimondo @whitehouse   They r looking for patterns of people calling terrorists, not what I think of my ex mother in law or my dogs
@Leslieannscott @whitehouse Yes, they say they're after "terrorists" -- but who are they really after? You. Me. All of us.
@JustinRaimondo @whitehouse   They have intercepted terrorists b4 they killed again. They want to know who is talking to terrorists.
@Leslieannscott Nope Leslies, they want to know EVERYTHING. Now take a rest from trolling & your check is in the mail.
@JustinRaimondo cell phone companies thank God have kept our phone records for police use to trace pings & prove if someone was at a murder
@Leslieannscott @JustinRaimondo "prove if someone was at a murder"-you're watching too much TV, multiple pings only prove what area youre in
@MommyVenting @JustinRaimondo 
I don't get it from TV.  I get it in the newspaper and the news. Computer searches & camera surveillance too

@whitehouse Dear Mr President, Close to 1/3 U.S. grain now going to ethanol to feed cars instead of people, we need solar, not biofuels
Your last tweet was 6/22! About Children&the environment! Lets start w/ allowing all to be born first, then enjoy! @whitehouse @BarackObama

@whitehouse Dear Mr President We don't need to design new fuels & new sources of energy, we need to make solar power accessible to everyone.
@WhiteHouse I am going to just go start my car....let it sit and pollute.

@whitehouse Yeah, we owe to them to stop pretending computer models can predict the climate 100 years from now.. 26 hurricanes under Grover!
@whitehouse @BarackObama What we owe to our kids is to stop showing them that we are a nation of takers.
@whitehouse So global warming is now climate change? The climate is always changing so the agenda is always correct? You are thieves.
@whitehouse Global warming threatens food security & our very existence on this planet, but the Sun that heats our planet can be our savior
@whitehouse We need 2 focus on solar! Per the Earth Policy Institute, the sunlight hitting Earth in 1 hr could power global economy for 1 yr
@whitehouse We owe it to our kids to leave them a country that is free and not broke/weak/under surveillance. This makes Bush look great...

@whitehouse the keystone pipeline is part of the problem.  Hope you're taking that into account.  This week, not sure what you're thinking.
@whitehouse Thank you. Looking forward to it. #RISK
@whitehouse  Is that the same climate with no temperature increases for over 15 years or that went through LIA, MWP, RWP, saw an ice age...
@whitehouse 90% of them probably dnt care or don't know

@whitehouse @AtlanticCanuck Odd how we absolutely must not pass on a deficit to our kids, but hey, give them a crappy planet.
@whitehouse @BarackObama it's odd how EVERY issue you put forward is meant to divide. MEANT to foment discontent and civil disobedience
@whitehouse @BarackObama what about the NEXT batch of 10 million illegals?
@whitehouse @BarackObama medical and charitable resources? Won't your proposal create a housing, employment and public services nightmare?
@whitehouse @BarackObama will it be my brothers job? My neighbors job? And what about the public liability for such amnesty in welfare
@whitehouse @BarackObama to support the privileges and burdens of citizenship? Will it be my job taken to accommodate these illegals?
@whitehouse @BarackObama revenues...really? Are Americans THAT stupid? And just where are these magically delicious jobs they'll get
@whitehouse @BarackObama you claim that the very act of granting blanket amnesty and citizenship to these will add half trillion $ in tax
@whitehouse @BarackObama you owe it to Americans to stop being too gutless to dragnet these illegals and deport them back to Mexico.

Our kids are going to owe a lot of people a lot of money, so technically we don't owe them shit. #amirite? @barackobama @whitehouse

@whitehouse @greenforall  I hope that President Obama have asked Al Gore  about climate change, ne did something on this question.
@whitehouse Before your announcement on #climate change @BarackObama read this letter. http://youtu.be/2r2Rx8VRq48  #hoping4change  No #fracking
@whitehouse @janekleeb We owe it to our kids to make sure they have jobs.  Nice "laser beam focus" on the economy.
The GOP jobs vs environment argument is outdated much like their party leadership @JonBlumenthal @whitehouse
@janekleeb @whitehouse I was just quoting the President.  I'm just waiting for this laser beam focus he spoke of before the "next" thing.

@whitehouse so then it's #NoKXL ? #climatechange
@whitehouse @seekerwisdom8 Then it would be best not to approve the Keystone pipeline. Put money where mouth is
@whitehouse We absolutely owe it to the PLANET to do something about #climatechange - so, say NO to #KeystoneXL for a start! @JackDeTate
@alikat747 I want the President to wait until the most politically advantageous moment to reject the #KXL pipeline to disaster. @whitehouse
@JackDeTate I have to say he worries me. I see NO convictions re our #environment or #wildlife He needs to come out strong! @whitehouse
@alikat747 Tuesday you will see direct action on carbon emissions. The EPA is a tool, used against GOP opposition, cuts out the middleman.
@JackDeTate Hope so, Jack! Hope so....
@whitehouse @BarackObama I will!!!!
@whitehouse Agreed. If our kids are gonna be broke & hopelessy in debt ....it might as well be nice beach weather #stopplayinggod #hubris
@whitehouse  Climate change is a natural and perpetual occurrence, not man made.  What is man made is creating and covering up events.
@whitehouse what about the IRS you whack job
@whitehouse We owe it to our kids to STOP the Keystone XL Pipeline! Not healthy for people or the planet!!
@whitehouse Please don't ok Keystone XL Pipeline. Definitely NOT good for our kids!

@whitehouse @WildlifeMag 

#Obama is pretty good at #rhetoric, lets reserve the applause until we see how things really pan out.
@kevinandseri BO is a Very Important Person: any climate change speech better than none? Especially as USA has high CO2 emissions per capita
@WildlifeMag speeches don't reduce carbon, actions do - we'll applaude action, not words.....
