Not my senator
Just as many do not recognize trump as the president for better reasons than you have.
#Please help Seniors, by voting against Trumps budget and ins. Pres. Executive Order, for it really harms Americans. https://action.aarp.org/site/Advocacy;jsessionid=00000000.app261b?cmd=display&page=UserAction&id=6774&cmp=EMC-ADV-NLC-null-MEDICARE-null-null-101617&autologin=true&NONCE_TOKEN=AA6612E20CD8FACE95E437E2BB3771D5 …
Nothing but propaganda from a left winger progressive, who wants to lead America into a socialist system.
Thank you sen for all u do. 45 isn't my president either. As an American and a Jew he has failed me and all of us. We pray tonight 4 us.
Hey #SenBrianSchatz haven't seen your tweet on what happened in #Charolettesville
Awesome  that leaving America, and taking your Maoist identity  politics to China.  Yea
Just called @SenBillNelson, office said they're getting a lot of calls. Told him I thought 'skinny bill' is crazy.
Call him back and tell him to demand trumps removal under amendment 25 section 4. We can't keep letting these people do this to us.
First of all, Leroy, you need a lesson.
Then there's this little matter of the Constitution & the @GOP lawsuit against Obama for legislating ...  while in the Executive branch
I said pay attn Leroy... @HouseGOP filed suit against Obama for legislating... as President
You'd look cute in prison with the harden criminals surrounding you...
Ohhh, U deserve an Oscar. Best BS-er!!!
A true leader is one who will gather a few of his or her associates & work side by side with the RNC to find a solution on everything.
They R up to no good Again! Let's stop this once and for or all of us will be hurting over this!
Amen!  Keep fighting!  Vote NO to #GrahamCassidy! 
Healthcare = life
Irresponsible to incite ppl apparently I have joined ranks of antifa BLM all Soros grps Hawaii deserves more
Don't you get ever get constipated from listening to your own bullshit? Or has it become just a part of who you really are?

So @SenBrianSchatz is on the #AltLeft payroll as well, it appears. Patriots take note. Schatz supports Left-caused hatred violence & facism.
You belong in a mental. A sitting senator no less who doesn't recognize his president. In short you are a Putz!
....mental institution.

you should be sent to GITMO, for a extended stay along with the other fake female that lies to get a free ride, wow. Pocahontas
We want it gone I'm not going to keep supporting illegals n welfare queens who refuse to work our premuims are sky high thanks Dems
All you seem to be concerned about is giving people free healthcare free college free but who gets to pay for it hard-working Americans
I'm a union guy that was a Democrat that this ridiculous Behavior has made me and all my friends go Republican.
ACA TRIPPED HEALTHCARE $$$$
The Democratic party wants to control the poor and control illegal immigrants to take care of the super-rich doners
It's absolutely amazing you still don't get it Obamacare  is strangling the families of 70% of Americans that make less than $75,000 a year
Thank you Sen Schatz for fighting passionately. It is an important crossroads. Stay vigilant til Sept 30 when Reconciliation isn't possible
Guess we stop paying, pay the fine and not participate. I am out of this. Period.
Every DEM Senator who spoke and/or voted for WtP also gets BIG kudos. Please find those who will work together and work with them. THANKS
#UniversalHealthCare for all.  Even those who think they don't want it.  That's how much @TheDemocrats love our country.
Americans r sick of ur resisting. Why don't u pick up the phone &  #WorkTOGETHER with @GOP & improve #ACA ? @CNNPolitics @HouseDemocrats
Resist what! It was Dems. That violated the COTUS and passed this pile of excrement in the first place. Stop being part of the problem!

Brian, please let us know which Obamacare plan you use. Or is it the special plan only Senators get
Thank you @brianschatz
Thank you for continuing to fight for your constituents!
Get rid of it.
Why don't you sign up for Obama care? Because it sucks.
This won't stop with healthcare. We are already on the road to hell. TRUMP is carrying the handbasket and Putin is driving the bus. Fire him
Watching Cspan! Thank you so much for your service. I  so proud to be a Democrat!
Democrats need to work with the Republicans to improve the disastrous Obamacare. Dems need to have more than a single strategy of resist!
Act like children, scream & holler and pretend we'll save you, but, it's a secret... we're BROKE! (we'll give you ACA+)...  Won't be pretty

Why would 15 million opt out of ObamaCare, per CBO, if it's so darn good? Why are you exempt, if it's so darn good? Repeal! Free Market!

How much in campaign contributions to you get from insurance companies?  Care to post the amount?
Why did you post this insult?
You're a goof #obstructionist
Your resistance is a real turn off. We are not paying for your resistance but your work. So, get to it!
You certainly aren't a Party for all Americans or else you'd want to help all those who lost HC because of Obamacare, get rid of it.
Stand Strong. Vote no American lives are at stake
#resist ...also when your health care fails at least you can still have your back scratched
total of 468 seats in the U.S. Congress (33 Senate seats and all 435 House seats) are up for election on November 6, 2018.
@TheDemocrats keep up the good work.
& whatever you do dont ask what this means...
Keep 202-224-3121, Don't Hold, Follow Prompts! Skinny Bill allows THEM TO TAKE MEDICAID/CARE LATER•BE PREPARED TO PEACEFULLY MARCH!4
Why is it Congress and the Senate don't have the same healthcare you screwed the American people with? Oh ya. Because it SUCKS.
Resist what? Passing something? You got that down.
Idiot
Quit letting insurance companies/healthcare providers/ pharmaceuticals merely profit. Healthcare must be a fiduciary system.
We will resist fascist like you Schatz.
What a strange person
that’s my senator!! thank you @SenBrianSchatz !!
The fight for health care isn’t over. Do whatever you can today. Stand up. Speak out. Resist. 
Thank you!

You have made a mess of healthcare in this country! The rich & poor can afford it the working class are paying for it & we are dying bc of u
I wish I was there!
Skinnt bill is a setup for conference where they'll add more medicaid cuts, age, tax, etc. more than 16M will lose coverage
Democrats should just start a healthcare collective for party members.
