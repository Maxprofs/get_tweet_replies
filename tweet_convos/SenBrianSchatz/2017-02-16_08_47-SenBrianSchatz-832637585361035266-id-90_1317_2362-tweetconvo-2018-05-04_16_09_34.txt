@Rosie @EPA  what are we fighting for?
- for climate change deniers to NOT run the EPA #RESIST
we need a miracle here. The Republican Congress backs him up that means Law and order is outnumbered.
Thank you, from a Dem.
- how is it that Republicans don't get this???
Hawai'i sets the bar. Again. #resist #Aloha #science
We all need to speak out, and as stupid as TRUMP is, he needs to shut the HELL up!! OMG!! HE is embarrassing...
THANK YOU! Climate Change should not be a partisan issue. It is real and effects us all.
thank you! I hope others will stand up for our planet, our children and their future!!!!
Thank you sir, keep fighting them. We all live on the same earth, Republicans must reproduce, save earth.
I have found nothing on which my views do not precisely align with yours!
@MrJamesonNeat @EPA Thank you, Senator Schatz
you're talking to sheep.
@SierraClub @EPA thank you for standing up for the well being of our planet!
PREACH IT !! THIS IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOO IMPORTANT!
Well said, @SenBrianSchatz [& thank u for RTing so I saw this, @GreatDismal] @EPA
thank you for rejecting Pruitt and saving the EPA.
@GreatDismal @EPA Looking forward to Pruitt running EPA. Refreshing change.
thank you for having integrity and doing the right thing!
.@SenBrianSchatz @GreatDismal @EPA #ClimateChange & #GlobalWarming are already here. the consequences will get worse
@Rosie @EPA BRAVO 
@Rosie @EPA I'm not a climate denier. There is definitely a climate! It is changing...It's called "the seasons!" :-P
Pruitt is unfit to serve if he cannot accept basic science. #RejectPruitt
@SenateDems @EPA How about we put someone in charge who actually understands the problem instead of you guys? How'd that be?
@Rosie @EPA 
Thanks for your effort Senator Schatz. You represent our state well.
the EPA needs a MAJOR overhaul. Making America great again
Thank you Senator Schatz.  You wouldn't think clean air, ground and water would succumb to partisanship
America is winning again
global warming is a hoax
@SenateDems @EPA thank you
You would think that was a no brainer.
#TruePatriots Bravo to this GOP Senator gets it. "Ask not, what your country can do for you" few on Rt seem to...
Thank you!
Thank you Senator Schatz - #RejectPruitt
That is scary for sure but Trump thinks nukes are toys that is worse.
you lost...get over it already...
thank you
@SierraClub @EPA Thank you, Senator Schatz! Amazing there are still climate deniers. Proof is in the ice shelf meltdown.
.@SenBrianSchatz Ur speech of this am on Senate floor was exceptional!If @SenateGOP wasnt convinced nor act true 2 themselves shame on them.
.@SenBrianSchatz @SenateGOP #RejectPruitt #StopPruitt #protectcleanwater #CleanAirAct @EPA At least wait after @AGScottPruitt emails relesd.
MISPRISION OF TREASON, knowingly allowing Treason without acting. Let the GOP hear the phrase! #resistance
@SierraClub @EPA Lindsay  Graham is the only one and his track record is poor.
suggests republicans ask their kids about the climate before voting for #Pruitt !

@SierraClub @EPA can you find any? #paidbybigoil
Thank you Senator Schatz!
@SierraClub @EPA thank you!!
It no difference if you don't believe in Climate Change or commit too few resources to prevent it
206 scientists say: â€œThat all taxes, regulations, and other interventions intended to reduce emissions of CO2 be abandoned."
Your "denier" comments slander and liable Scott Pruitt.  He can prove CO2 benefits citizens.  You cannot prove harm.
Continue fighting this man. Don't let him be nominated.
Yes! NO! NO! NO, to ogre Pruitt! It's panic time!
Thank you!  To those who are climate deniers, please read science not blogs.  Science is real facts.
Thank you.  You will never truly know how much your efforts are appreciated.
THANK YOU, Senator Schatz.  I am proud to call you my Senator.  #RejectPruitt
Thank you! Someone who understands it is about the future and our planet, not just jobs.
Bravo Senator! Thank you for standing up!
amazing. Thank you sir. Hopefully they'll listen.
@SenWhitehouse  go Brian go truth trumps politics
Thank you.
@AltSmithsonian @EPA omg THANK YOU for being a Republican with some common sense AND a backbone. #AmericaThanksYou
thank you Senator!
Why does this even need to be said. Greedy people wanting to line their pockets over the health of the planet!
@SenateDems @EPA then why did you vote for all the wrong things in this cabinet Pruitt is no different than you
Time to shut down the EPA
@Tumbletron why appoint an @EPA chief when the agency will be dismantled in 2018? 
The bill is already signed, isn't it?
There have been many times in earth's history there was no ice anywhere on planet...You ppl are #fakenews.
@SenateDems @EPA how many times do you have to be shown that scientists have either made-up or faked data?
@SenateDems @EPA I don't believe climate change is man made. I believe it's man made to make big money.
Save God's earth....we almost lost it in Noah's time, don't do it again or we will loose it for good.
@SenateDems @EPA !! You lose
Wow! So proud to see someone stand up for people and not just policy!
Thank you @SenBrianSchatz - @SenateGOP , take heed. The time is now. @350 @SenateDems @EPA
@SenateDems @EPA Well said senator! #pollutingPruitt #stopthemadness
@SenateDems @EPA Do your your job congress!
@SenateDems @EPA That's right Brian. Protect Hawaii and all Mother Earth.
Your false religion of climate change will crumble.
Yes! Thank you Senator!
