@jimmykimmel So, if Sarah Palin refutes gorebal warming, it must be wrong? See "Ad Hominem Argument" Jimmy. This is fallacy 101 stuff.
For that to happen, she'd have to study in the field, co-author a paper, have it peer reviewed & published @Thorson_Viking @jimmykimmel
@PascalLeroux @jimmykimmel No, I'm talking about a person just making a statement. Just because _ _ _ _ says it , it isn't true?
It's like a child crawling up to NASA with mentos and diet soda telling them they've been doing it wrong. @Thorson_Viking @jimmykimmel
@PascalLeroux @jimmykimmel If Hitler made the statement "The earth is round." it would be invalid because of the person saying it?
Same reason you don't have Sarah Palin designing buildings. If she builds something, people will get hurt. @Thorson_Viking @jimmykimmel
@PascalLeroux @jimmykimmel Palin was a Governor. Everyone who isn't or wasn't a governor holds no legitimate gubernatorial opinions?
Fields of expertise that require evidence based, peer reviewed study to progress aren't subject to opinion @Thorson_Viking @jimmykimmel
No, but it does have myriad branches within that do require a degree and then specialization chucklenuts. @NickCiparro @jimmykimmel
Actually AGW's the accepted norm https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KLGqDSAjo&list=PL82yk73N8eoX-Xobr_TfHsWPfAIyI7VAP&index=1&ab_channel=potholer54 … @NickCiparro @jimmykimmel
Uh, that's not how science works. You need to be published in a peer reviewed journal and disprove current models @NickCiparro @jimmykimmel
They have moron. That's why there's myriad papers in science journals that have survived the peer review process. @NickCiparro @jimmykimmel
@jimmykimmel Using your station to promote and advance Obama's agenda. You are a mouthpiece.
It's not. It's peer reviewed & takes a lot of work and effort to publish a paper, unlike denialist tripe.. @Gregory__Adams @jimmykimmel
@PascalLeroux @jimmykimmel Keep using words like tripe to make yourself feel superior. The moral high ground is lost on lies to the citizens
You can't. Unless you're smart enough to earn a degree, co-author a paper, get peer reviewed and publish. @Gregory__Adams @jimmykimmel
@PascalLeroux @jimmykimmel Proven that advocates enter into degree programs just to advance the narrative.
You can't advance a narrative with science. That's the point. That's what peer reviewed means. @Gregory__Adams @jimmykimmel
@PascalLeroux @jimmykimmel The evidence has been shown that altering of records was used to advance those narratives.
Wrong. Again, this information is verified fucko. @Gregory__Adams @jimmykimmel
@jimmykimmel lol
@jimmykimmel One volcanic eruption puts more CO2 into the atmosphere than all of the SUV's ever built in America. #ClimateChangeCoolaide
.@WBHallows maybe learn to spell Kool-Aid and we'll evaluate your thoughts on science from there
.@jimmykimmel @WBHallows actually it's a pretty good play on words #derp
@jimmykimmel the worst problem is that REAL people TODAY are being hurt by politicians using this idea to take over economies and kill jobs
@jimmykimmel Sure, you believe every scientist on earth, I defer to Louis Gohmert and Michelle Bachmann for my science info.
@JoshLymen @jimmykimmel throw in a little Palin and you have got the greatest thinkers of our generation.
Sarah Palin is smarter than Jimmy Kimmel that is for sure. Kimmel has 20 writers and still sounds stupid
@merehut @JoshLymen @jimmykimmel
@casetwin @GideonGutenburg @JoshLymen @jimmykimmel trolls gotta troll.
@casetwin I am pretty sure your political choices or opinions have little interest to me, but thanks for sharing.
@jimmykimmel Do scientific research the rainforests do control the climate their trees do. trees are our oxygen!
Actually, a large amount of the Earth's oxygen comes from the ocean, & it's dying at unprecedented rates. @JaniceKeough @jimmykimmel
@PascalLeroux @jimmykimmel. its trees. theyve been killing the ocean for ages. with oil spills and all kind of stuff
@PascalLeroux @jimmykimmel hypdadermic needles. and trash etc
That's part of it, but CO2 is far more detrimental. It changes the ocean's chemistry. It's called acidification @JaniceKeough @jimmykimmel
@PascalLeroux @JaniceKeough @jimmykimmel CO2 doesn't cause warmth - warmth causes more CO2
Please... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52KLGqDSAjo&list=PL82yk73N8eoX-Xobr_TfHsWPfAIyI7VAP&index=1&ab_channel=potholer54 … Try following an actual scientist. @rtoberl @JaniceKeough @jimmykimmel
@jimmykimmel Using curse words doesn't change the facts...there is no warming...has not been for over 16 years...in fact it's cooling!
@CapitanBilly @jimmykimmel Its getting cooler cuz your getting very old. Old farts get cold easily
@OtisTwaddell @jimmykimmel Really? Socrates: "You can survive wars but survive from human meaness is another tuffer challenge."
Have you seen this?
@jimmykimmel Climate is always changing...so how does paying for carbon credits, which allows companies to pollute, improve that situation?
@WBHallows @jimmykimmel Without CO2 there's no life. Now at 400ppm, 66 million years ago it was 1700ppm & planet was greener & more diverse.
@jimmykimmel @JackDaly34 show this to dad!
@jimmykimmel Do a little more research & a little less bashing
.@jimmykimmel
Unverified junk science like this is why the peer review system is in place. Try publishing that in science fucko. @ElectedMob @jimmykimmel
@PascalLeroux @jimmykimmel your pleasantries explain your anemic following and need for PayPal donations.
Oh look, you followed up your verbal diarrhoea with a non sequitur. Science isn't a popularity contest snowflake. @ElectedMob @jimmykimmel
@PascalLeroux @jimmykimmel my verbal diarrhea? Hahaha! #YouAreProjecting
@jimmykimmel It is narrow minded2blame CO2 to the exclusion of everything else. Get educated:
@tan123 @AlexEpstein @ClimateOfGavin  Some very good points raised by former warmist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FuKSK7kP0s … 
@jimmykimmel Yeah, because, like, you know, the earth's temps have never fluctuated before.
@jimmykimmel Maybe you should look up what % of carbon emissions are created by humans. Global warming is bullshit.
@Rockhead29 @jimmykimmel Uhhhhhhhhh
.@jimmykimmel Who is the moron now? Besides you & your viewers? Leftist hacks who promote junk science.
McExperts like you are and everyone who buys into this bullshit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnVQ2fROOg&index=6&list=PL82yk73N8eoX-Xobr_TfHsWPfAIyI7VAP&ab_channel=potholer54 … @ElectedMob @jimmykimmel
@PascalLeroux @jimmykimmel you are really bad at this...  Have any of your 100 followers given you money via your PayPal scam?
@jimmykimmel @MikeHudema Mike I thought you would love this video Kimmel put together. :D have a fab day.
. @jimmykimmel not just rising oceans - look at Ft McMurray.  This could be CA. Thnx for taking on #ClimateSkeptics
@jimmykimmel Thank for the best climate change science communication I have seen!  Can we hire you?
.@jimmykimmel Fun fact for you: Of the 50 USA state maximum temperature records, 36 were set prior to freakin' 1940 http://ggweather.com/climate/extremes_us.htm …
@tan123 @jimmykimmel  Record heat is #GlobalWarming , record cold is #climatechange  #LeapManifesto @ElizabethMay
@jimmykimmel @ClimateDepot Swearing is the last resort of the ignorant and stupid
@jimmykimmel Superb!
@jimmykimmel Brilliant Jimmy!!
@jimmykimmel what's the temp supposed to be? Scientist don't know either.
And Jimmy flies off in his jet burning more fuel than all of us.
@jimmykimmel If you believe in climate change why are you promoting it? Be smart about choices. #Cowspiracy #GoVegan
@jimmykimmel why not scientist si talking about a scinetific theory, you can't understand this.
@jimmykimmel beliving is not science you nead proves, and you can't vote for one or another option
@jimmykimmel Love it!!!#NotFingWithYou
@jimmykimmel #nicefuckingmouth
@jimmykimmel @DrOz  Yes you are Fing with us! Cause you treat your body worse than mother earth, but no comedic rant on that one! #nopudding
Hell. If I wanted to fuck with y'all using math and science, I would have put up a casino. Oh but then I'd be @realDonaldTrump. @jimmykimmel
@jimmykimmel shut up Kimmel. Just shut up. Keep politics OUT!!!
@jimmykimmel merci
@jimmykimmel @nikolajcw so wish I could share this with my 7th graders! Love this clip, thanks! #NotFingWithYou
@jimmykimmel heartfelt thanks.
@jimmykimmel ... now back to your regularly scheduled sheep show.
.@jimmykimmel these tweets won't make your show because they are too educated. Your viewers won't understand them. Slate loved your act.

.@jimmykimmel
.@jimmykimmel I guess you never heard of #ClimateGate & it's sequel? You know, UN climate scientists manipulated data to fit their narrative
@jimmykimmel Real Scientists disagree on the subject, and morons like yourself should keep your mouth shut. Pull you head out of your butt
@jimmykimmel view this on climate change
@jimmykimmel Why would you piss off 1/2 of your audience who don't agree with you. You will go by the wayside like Stephen Colbert.
If it is 1/2 his audience, which I doubt, they're colossal morons. Science isn't a matter of opinion/debate. @CindyBr15464234 @jimmykimmel

@jimmykimmel Thank you, Jimmy! I love you for doing this
@jimmykimmel  Your "real scientists" are pulling the wool over ur eyes. There is no global temperature.
He's not a real climate scientist moron. http://www.desmogblog.com/christopher-essex … Nor has he been publised in the field. @4TimesAYear @jimmykimmel
@PascalLeroux @jimmykimmel I know he's not a climate scientist. It doesn't take a climate scientist to know there is no freakin global temp
@jimmykimmel "I believe in a magic man in the sky that has no scientific proof.. Global warming that's horse shit" LOL 'Murica.
@jimmykimmel is super butthurt EricTheMidget never got 2 take that balloon chair ride so now he's building a weather machine in his memory.
@jimmykimmel Please educate urself before telling millions of viewer the wrong facts..http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/05/03/jimmy-kimmel-totally-ing-wrong-on-climate-change/ …
@jimmykimmel went full retard. Tell me wise weather wizard how to control the climate. Even AceMan knows this is BS.
@jimmykimmel U should get ur facts right before going on air. http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/04/28/icegate-now-nsidc-caught-tampering-with-climate-records/ …

@jimmykimmel @ClimateDepot #sealevelrise #ExxonKnew #disinformation #ClimateDeniers #
@jimmykimmel Have2be blind2blame our emissions to the exclusion of all else; that's not science. Jim Steele's YT videos show how wrong u are
@jimmykimmel @OliviaThor23
@baylajigs @jimmykimmel Who does Sarah Palin think she is? 
@jimmykimmel The real elephant in the room is the fact that these 97% that you tout are not all actual scientists, they are clowns like Gore
@jimmykimmel Kimmel advocating for climte change is like an arsonist advocating for fire prevention. The jokes write themselves ;-)
@jimmykimmel Sarah WAS a BIT on the "wrong side of the clock" for reproduction BUT she is RIGHT about "climate change" AKA summer, winterETC
Bold move @jimmykimmel THANK YOU for this!
@jimmykimmel JIMMY it is NOT "scientific" it is a TAX EXCUSE based on "polution credits" based on "rice allotments".
@jimmykimmel Call me when your CO2 emissions are zero and I'll stop laughing at you.
@jimmykimmel great piece! That's why I put out the song #saveme from all this insane crazy shit https://youtu.be/TE_vuiWM3-s  #climatechange
@jimmykimmel love it!
.@jimmykimmel .@SarahPalinUSA Thank you, Jimmy for exposing the coward deniers  #PutSolarOn #climatechange #Trump
@jimmykimmel you have a kids cussingZ. Really done with your show
@jimmykimmel No electric bills, no gas with electric cars, no coal for heating all free provide by the sun. Who loses that money?
@jimmykimmel Who loses if climate change real? Our country would go solar and wind energy instead of oil and coal.
@jimmykimmel yes let's not believe scientists..Let's all believe a cuckoo crazy lady  I'll let everyone here in Europe know that we're good
. @jimmykimmel dropping F-Bombs and using a little kid to do same really makes these scientists credible #NOT  #climatechangeISahoax
@jimmykimmel ha ha ha ha haha

@jimmykimmel so.......
@jimmykimmel scientist are so ridiculous it makes me sick
@jimmykimmel conservatives are fucking idiots. Thanks Jimmy.
@jimmykimmel The real problem is overpopulation is causing the change. 2.5B people need to die. But no one will say that. Inconvenient Truth
@jimmykimmel well done brother well done

@tan123 @jimmykimmel He picked up the thug life from Leo King of the World DiCaprio
@shubclimate @tan123 @jimmykimmel just another Hollywood hypocrite telling the "little" people what to do while living the life of Riley....
@jimmykimmel do you know how much CO2 you breathe out with each breath?
@jimmykimmel thank you, Jimmy! Too bad for all the ignorant haters. But I will say meat production is a huge contributor to climate change!
@jimmykimmel Carbon pollution! hahaha. So how come NONE the "apocolyptic" predictions re climate made over recent decades have materialised?
.@jimmykimmel claims warmist scientists on his video are "just a smarter version of us" 4:40
They use the f-bomb for the same reason they want their betters put in jail: "Man did it" liars don't have legit science. @jimmykimmel
.@jimmykimmel on his climate cult rant: "I know I'll get beaten over the head by every wacko web site" 4:20
@jimmykimmel saw an article where it says you live longer when curse lol
@jimmykimmel go jimmy!! #sarahpalinisajoke
@jimmykimmel you can't ridicule the opposition to the point where nobody debates it anymore. Theory should hold up to scrutiny.
@jimmykimmel  that ending 
@jimmykimmel the "action on climate" will be a tax; The end goal of this scam is a carbon tax. It's a tax worth trillions and world control.
@jimmykimmel these scientists  would bullshit us TO KEEP THEIR JOBS and those employing them would bullshit u to rule the earth through tax!
@jimmykimmel Free Downloads!!!!!
@jimmykimmel I buy that climate is changing & that we have acute air & H2O pollution problems in developing countries. Don't buy causality
@jimmykimmel climate change has always been going on.  I’ve got a problem when someone says the debate is over.  #control #whatwouldadamsay
@jimmykimmel fact:  40 years ago scientists were saying if nothing was done at that time, we'd be in a 2nd ice age by now.  How did that go?
@jimmykimmel great piece! I love the idea that scientists are being bribed but there's clearly no oil money supporting their interests.
@jimmykimmel Why would they make it up? I don't know...how much does a Ph.D. in climate science cost? Yeah, go <BLEEP> yourselves.
who would've thought back in 2003 when @jimmykimmel was the last late show you'd flip to on commercials that he'd become such a voice 
@jimmykimmel Without higher levels of CO2 the rainforests would have died out by now and you would have REAL climate change!
@WBHallows @jimmykimmel wtf?  This is just idiotic.  so now u think humans are affecting c02 but it saved the rain forests?  Dude.
@jimmykimmel ..Very true lol
@jimmykimmel the kid at the end 
@jimmykimmel qualifies for diatribe of the year.
@jimmykimmel I believe you all aren't F#*king with me. :) spectacular informative video. Thanks.
@jimmykimmel you's crazy. the world is flat.  How else would I be able to see Russia from my home? I'm Christian, I don't lie. Go Palin!
@jimmykimmel science 
@jimmykimmel I always turn to late night comedians for "science" and other neat stuff!
#ClimateHustle
@jimmykimmel Funny and clever as always. Hoping the same level of analysis is applied to Dr Oz tonight.
Best hair in late night....@jimmykimmel
@jimmykimmel They are desperate to be believed if they came to you. Are you still looking for that "right to privacy" in the Constitution?
@jimmykimmel A hundred times thank you! Next on that list of issues to be discussed is money in politics.....right? ;)
@PJillIrwin: @jimmykimmel Thanks forAwesome segment on climate change! #ClimateChangeTheFacts #NotFingWithYou
Hey @jimmykimmel, research shows removing your nasty hot earwax in public and wiping it on seat is a major contributor to global warming
@jimmykimmel They help give vent to your frustrations.
@jimmykimmel Thanks forAwesome segment on climate change! #ClimateChangeTheFacts #NotFingWithYou
@jimmykimmel Always look to your show for answers to incredibly complex scientific issues...actually SOME of them MAY be f'ing with you...
@jimmykimmel joann demarco is the prank. .. thats my prank to hollywood. and martha ;)
@jimmykimmel k well martha was rain phoenixs prank lol. but you know she thought she was the real talent :).. so you know she pranked la
