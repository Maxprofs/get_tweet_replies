@POTUS no, they deserve low cost health care and not being unconstitutionally forced to buy something to be alive
@YoungbloodJoe @POTUS I've read the constitution and did not see the prohibition you refer to.
@RandyWestfahl @POTUS The constitution must GRANT the government rights to do things. It does not GRANT that right anywhere.
@YoungbloodJoe @POTUS where did it grant them the right to post speed limits, require car insurance, madate teachers to report crimes. Silly
@YoungbloodJoe @POTUS The constitution also does not mandate I pay for uninsured visitors to emergency rooms.
@RandyWestfahl @POTUS I'm not sure how that validates forcing people to pay money to a private corporation?
@YoungbloodJoe @POTUS Yeah I get that you aren't sure. You don't like it because this particular president did it. Hide behind constitution.
@POTUS @WhiteHouse  I got coverage before your healthcare act went into effect.   As of yesterday, my premium has DOUBLED.  DOUBLED.  Thanks
@briarswt You don't have to keep it.
@BdwayDiva1 With the health issues I have? Yes, I do.   I have yet to find one that works for me that is cheaper.
@briarswt No I mean the one offered from your employer. If it's unaffordable, by law, you can drop it & get in on the marketplace
@BdwayDiva1 it’s not via an employer.
@briarswt You have marketplace insurance? Then just switch your plan. The signups are open now
@BdwayDiva1 And I thought premiums weren’t supposed to rise?
@briarswt Most employer based insurance premiums went WAY down, because they had to, by law. They were overcharging
@POTUS trouble with Aetna documentation. Called state and fed but no help.
@kimchee413 Sure, follow @AetnaHelp & I'll DM you. ^LL

@POTUS  ROTF, half your co-ops have FAILED...Obamacare is a FAILURE!!  YOU are a failure.
every American deserves health care but not every American deserves to have to pay higher prices for Better Health Care.
@POTUS So why did you pass SCOTUSCare which only made it LESS affordable? Higher premiums and deductibles doesn't help....
@POTUS  your healthcare sucks too expensive please resign now you doing nothing good for american people
@POTUS wouldn't it also be a nice thing if every person across the globe had that same inalienable right.
@POTUS my daughter works two jobs and makes a combined total 12k but she was told she would have to pay 6k for health care. Why?

@POTUS every American also has the right to bear arms and free speech, the right to worship,
@POTUS This issue is not going well. My son as many others can't get the help they need. Can't get their meds or even appts with some of it
@POTUS Health care is not a right. Read the Declaration of Independence for a proper understand of "rights."

@POTUS Every year since you've been in office my healthcare care has gone UP! Affordable for who? Ones who never paid to begin with? #Gruber
@POTUS 

Every American also deserves to have clean and reliable drinking water. I hope to this attached to the new climate bill 
#Water
@POTUS fuck American.  Ever human needs it, at varions unexpected moments in their lives.  & maybe our #CanadianSystemIsBetterThanYours ? ;)

@POTUS It will cost the taxpayer more money to take care of people who do not have healthcare.
@POTUS it is not affordable!
@POTUS #Luthersays & you shat on that
@POTUS the words quality and affordable never go together in Obamacare.
@POTUS i checked. It is ten times more than what I already pay. Insane!
@POTUS anybody that signs up will regret it, lousy medical care
@POTUS PLEASE please please get rid of Chuck Rosenberg. He is making your administration sound foolish re: MMJ.
@POTUS Americans have not bought into your health plan even at the expense of a tax. Shouldn't that tell you something?
@POTUS define affordable? Cuz mine has doubled and continues to rise with a decrease in benefits...when will it get "affordable"?
@POTUS My brother is paying $800 month for health coverage, THANK U!
@POTUS it's not affordable at all!
@POTUS GUESS WHAT? cant afford your so called affordable heath care so I, a law abiding tax paing citizen gets punished, NO REFUND FU
@POTUS Show me in the constitution where healthcare is a right?
@POTUS My monthly #premium significantly increased with my renewal. A big blow to a #married couple one recently with #cancer & not able 2wk
@POTUS If it's so affordable, they why does the tax payer have to pay half of it?
@POTUS it's not affordable for everyone
@POTUS astounding how you continue to tell people this lie! What world are you living in???
And VOTE for Bernie Sanders if you want Single payer at cheaper value than ACA that Blue dogs and GOP voted down in @POTUS Adm.
@POTUS I did the math and came up with this, it's cheaper to not have the insurance and just pay the penalty at the 1st of the year.
@POTUS screw Obamacare, it is worthless and more expensive.
@POTUS You need mental health care
@POTUS I looked at your plans. They were completely unaffordable to me.
@POTUS is that why my parents health care cost has doubled?
@POTUS Every American deserves better leadership than yours. The Founding Fathers would have you digging latrines.
@AngieDrue @POTUS especially not when we have homeless men, women and children, plus thousands of veterans living on the streets!
@POTUS i wouldnt call $335.00 a month for a non smoker in the worst bracket affordable.  #EpicFail #obamacare

@POTUS Media & Social Media Response To Paris Attack Raises Questions – Are We BIASED?
http://voiceornoice.com/media-social-media-response-to-paris-attack-raises-questions-are-we-biased/ …
@POTUS Have you looked at the prices of this "affordable " health care? I can't afford it...
@POTUS Sorry Sir, by patronizing ISIS directly or indirectly you Cabot do any thing.
@POTUS holy wow have the premiums gone up this year, for worse insurance. Not very affordable at all.
@POTUS But you said AFFORDABLE???
@POTUS just FYI this didn't work for me. I was denied antibiotics and compression stockings. But can get pan meds for $1.
@POTUS *pain
@POTUS Yes we will all need a lot health care with your foreign policy #ISIS
@POTUS Absolutely! Great job!
@POTUS Our premiums and expenses have gone up 60%+ since 2012. We are spending over $9000 more per year. Affordable?

@POTUS what a wonderful idea. How I wish Nigeria can imitate your government. Just thinking. Kudos!
@POTUS In the long term, only a Medicare for all has any chance of success.
@POTUS 
My premiums didnt go down $2500 - they're up hundreds of %
My deductibles are up
My flex spending limit is cut in half
Its a failure
@POTUS as long as they pay taxes!!!!
@POTUS Friends say their payments are over $600 a month for themselves alone and they have NO deduction...
@POTUS Every American, except anyone from a governmental standpoint. Because you all voted to exempt yourselves from this AWESOME healthcare
@POTUS but not everyone is getting it. You simply took it from hard working white folks and gave it to non working blacks.
@POTUS Imagine Having the ability To (in effect) chg World. Knowing Need/Pain/Sorrow. Imagine B'n Among Those. (Make List possibilities ea)
@POTUS Every teacher deserved to not have their pay based on performance unless everything is equal.  Not possible!
@POTUS The ACA is a disaster! I can't wait till 1/20/17!!!! You should be impeached immediately!!
@POTUS too expensive. Thanks Obama.
@POTUS didn't you say ISIS was shrinking hours before the Paris attack?  Do you have a clue about anything?

@POTUS With respect Mr. President, I've had a lot of problems with this program. Costs have steadily risen. It's becoming untenable.
@POTUS no one can afford the high premiums and deductibles?  Your taking money from ppl so that can't afford care
@POTUS just this AM #POTUS declares #ISIS contained! Ask people of #ParisAttacks #ParisShooting if IDIS contained http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/11/13/obama-isis-is-not-getting-stronger-we-have-contained-them/ …

@POTUS When are we, as a country, going to address the failure of "Dental Insurance"? It has not increased annual  coverage in >30 years!
@POTUS Yeah, but affordable healthcare need NOT line the pockets of the insurance industry. Let's look at other possible solutions!
@POTUS our premiums have doubled in two years- small business owners that are trying to keep our doors open and working long hours to do it
@POTUS healthcare is neither quality or affordable? $1100 per month for family of 3 with $5000 deductible. Is that really affordable?
@POTUS And they deserve to be punished with fines if they can't afford it, right?
@POTUS Yes sign up because its only cost Twice as Much as the free Market before gov interference!!!!

Unfortunately @POTUS it's not so affordable for many. It does need an overhaul to better coverage for affordable rates.
