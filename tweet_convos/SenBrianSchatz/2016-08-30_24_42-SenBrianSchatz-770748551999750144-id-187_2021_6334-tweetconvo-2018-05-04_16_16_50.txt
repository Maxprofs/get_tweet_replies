Excellent news but detracts from more endangered local waters sadly.
.@LeoDiCaprio @climatemessages @POTUS @SenBrianSchatz The thing about #GlobalWarming is we can't protect it very long. #CarbonTax far better
Sickening. All this does is deliver resources into the sole, greedy hands of corrupt politicians.

One night you told me that you can't live a moment without me, and i never talked again because in my hands i had you, only you
One night you we told me that i must have been born for you, only for you. And i hug you and got lost at your enchanted eyes
scared. 
You not to be alone and me to nothing. I stayed here for you not to fennel.
my light, don 't leave, my light '
And i stayed here for you not to miss anything,
i stayed here for you not to get
One night i 've told you that i want to fly like a bird above the world. And you painted wings at a white paper and told me
One night i 've told you that i want to  go arround the whole world and you smiled sweetly and told me that my kiss smells mint
If he hadn t stayed i wouldn 't do half of the things i 've done in my life. I chose to run away from the problem. It says:
This song somehow describes the relationship my brother had with my sister. The one that had schizophrenia
