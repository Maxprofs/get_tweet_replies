@DMRegister why haven't you come out against last week's exec order?
if you REALLY felt that way and weren't just pandering to your base then you have to speak out now!
@ChuckGrassley shouldn't you be at a green acres reunion instead of pretending to care about the constitution and destroying our politics?
@ChuckGrassley @sahilkapur you broke the US Government to win elections, refusing to govern. Stop your whining and do your job.
@SoSezAdrienne @corvetteBeth @ChuckGrassley @sahilkapur
Funny, I don't recall Chuck calling Shrub or Daddy Bush or Reagan a king. #Hypocrite
Do you still think it's unconstitutional????
@timhansonjr lets see u do something about current dud! Strap on a new Depends and get to work!
.@ChuckGrassley Please publicly oppose Trump's unconstitutional Muslim ban.

@ChuckGrassley @sahilkapur The EO will expand the parameters of an existing Immigration Law.
@ChuckGrassley @Ronc99 It's just that there is Absolutely NOTHING in the Republican party for:
-Women.          
-Immigrants 
-Veterans
@ChuckGrassley @Ronc99 Go retire Chucky a constitutional professor may be more tlented & skillful than a bunch of Rs dinosaurs liars.
@ChuckGrassley What is Congress doing to stop him from acting like a king? Why haven't you IMPEACHED & REMOVED him from office? LEADERSHIP?
I'll wait for your updated impeachment tweet....
@ChuckGrassley I think he has shown the answer to that question in the last 6 years. Yes he wants to be King.
hi....
@IowaGOP SHAME! SHAME! SHAME! SHAME!  #GOPhypocrisy #noMuslimBan
@ChuckGrassley @Ronc99 If your party could just figure out how to make them ALL vote republican- U would have Opened the floodgates already!
.@ChuckGrassley oops, forgot the hashtags! #resist #stopsessions #StopPresidentBannon #ResistTrumpTuesdays
.@ChuckGrassley *confused*
what say you now?
I am calling on you, as your constituent: Now that the Constitution is being flagrantly violated, daily--stand up, speak out.
@ChuckGrassley @sahilkapur they also wanted a functioning congress and not u. So well, live with it..
@ChuckGrassley @Ronc99 As unconstitutional as owing SS 2 trillion? Put the money back and we can talk.
.@ChuckGrassley But you said, “It's quite a victory to get it done by executive” when Bush signed an E-Verify order. http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0806/14/ldtw.01.html …
@mhildreth @ChuckGrassley. Yup, it's politics folks. P-O-L-I-T-X-M-O-U-S-E !  And where is the REAL birth certificate, HUH?!   #GrassHats !
But you don't feel the same about Trump doing the same thing?
@ChuckGrassley Alot of comments senator looks like the american people have spoken now go to boehner to pass the bill Monday or else
@ChuckGrassley @sahilkapur I hope he puts the veto pen in overdrive
@ChuckGrassley @Ronc99 Well, if we waited for Republicans to actually DO something, we'd be waiting forever, wouldn't we?
@ChuckGrassley @MaxCUA Wait for the Lynch pen!
@ChuckGrassley Reid is going to try to Rush Bills through in the Senate to have Obama sign.  Tea Party watching you Reid!!
@ChuckGrassley He can do whatever he wants if it includes deporting you.
@chuckgrassley @tinapayson chuckie boi doesnt mind if your children sick & die for lack of health care- he's pimped by insurance companies
@chuckgrassley @tinapayson imagine, you pay chuckie grissley for doing nothing. excuse me, i mean, SITTING ON HIS ASS.
@ChuckGrassley #Obama can do #ExecutiveOrder as #POTUS. LiE: It is not unconstitutional! PRESIDENTS, REPUB & Dems, use #EO to get stuff done
@ChuckGrassley @corvetteBeth now who duz Grassfedly thinks he is ? some kinder politician
@PiperDewn Chuckie G. is never Kind!!!
@ChuckGrassley @corvetteBeth The people saying keep off the grass are running and dancing on the fucking stuff.
@AlJShort  Chuckie G. is full of GrassAss lunacy!
@ChuckGrassley @corvetteBeth I think he should. If we wait in you guys we'll be long in our graves. Party of Uselessness @GOP
@Marypop987 @ChuckGrassley Senator GrassAss is totally useless!!!
@ChuckGrassley The fine senator forgets that his party in the House is ignoring an up/down vote on Senate bipartisan immigration legislation
@ChuckGrassley And they didn't expect assholes in congress either..
@ChuckGrassley has anyone ever even read the constitution to you?
@ChuckGrassley You well know that Executive Orders have been used since Washington's time. Don't be evil.
@ChuckGrassley THE CONSTITUTIONAL WRITERS ALSO WANTED A CONGRESS THAT DIDNT SUCK
@ChuckGrassley @Atrios man, English 101.
@ChuckGrassley @Atrios Republicans are the Unamerican party of do nothing.  Obama should do whatever the Const allows, which includes CIR.
@ChuckGrassley then do your fucking job. Pretty sure he was elected twice by large margins not just from 1 state or district but entire USA
.@ChuckGrassley I WAMT TO IMICRATION BY BOAT OR PLANE NOT EXECUTOR
.@ChuckGrassley Instead, they got you and your ilk.
.@ChuckGrassley No,Chuck, the Constitution Writers wanted a Congress of thoughtful, intelligent people who would work to improve the country
@ChuckGrassley My wife waited her turn for 10 years to do things legally. She voted for the first time this year. Thank you!
@ChuckGrassley My point, was Lincoln a king when he signed the Emancipation Proclamation...by executive order
@ChuckGrassley if he does that-better start proceedings to impeach him.#enoughisenough
@ChuckGrassley Be a leader. Push your cohorts to pass long overdue immigration reform. #grassley #donothingcongress
@ChuckGrassley no, they wanted a loyal opposition. Instead they got the Republican Party.
@ChuckGrassley @JoeMande this is terrible English. what are you trying to say?
@chuckgrassley @americasvoice Did the Constitution Writers wanted a GOP party that blocks everything? Hastert rule is undemocratic!
@ChuckGrassley is the dementia setting in already?
@ChuckGrassley @JoeMande you are A Fckng moron
@ChuckGrassley no, they wanted legislators who actually worked together and compromised for the good of ALL Americans.
@ChuckGrassley are u high on drug? I think its high time for u to head to nursing home. What about Bush and Reagan administration
.@ChuckGrassley You said “it's quite a victory to get it done by executive” re: this #immigration order http://bit.ly/BushImmigrationOrder … @elisefoley
@mhildreth @ChuckGrassley NO JUSTICE! NO LatinoVOTES! come Nov.2016 Like Nov2014 BOYCOTT Deport ObamaDems from @WhiteHouse #brokenpromises
@ChuckGrassley I would really appreciate it if Congress would tackle that topic and head him off.
@ChuckGrassley Bruce Braley was 100% correct about you only he was too polite
@ChuckGrassley Pretty sure the Constitution Writers wanted a DAIRY QUEEN
@ChuckGrassley A "King" wouldn't be serving the last two years in his duly-elected office, you idiot. There would be no next election.
@ChuckGrassley for sure keep tweeting.  Obviously keep tweeting.
@ChuckGrassley Only if this statement applies to Reagan?.?.?
.@chuckgrassley Pres first priority is to run country. Not kiss your ass. Constitution demands executive action when important.
@ChuckGrassley I'm begging you. Learn basic grammar and punctuation. YOU ARE A UNITED STATES SENATOR.
@ChuckGrassley I also want to immigration, to immigration is good.
@ChuckGrassley I thought you were a fan of history? Either u aren't, or ur misleading the public for political gain. http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/orders.php 
.@ChuckGrassley has decided to copy the Twitter style of 13 year olds talking to their guild mates in World of Warcraft.
@MichaelClear You'd be surprised at the complexity and sophistication of some 13 year old wowheads.
@ChuckGrassley Do you think Constitution Writers wanted to ban hemp ? Leary vs US 1969 old fool cannabis prohibition is ending #smokethevote
@ChuckGrassley  Problem is the process to stop him is too cumbersome and takes too much time. Damage already done.
@ChuckGrassley more like Suck Assley, haha that just happened dog.
@pnuts_mama @ChuckGrassley 

Why would it be unconstitutional?
@pnuts_mama @ChuckGrassley 

J. Carter 320
R. Reagan 381
G.H.W. Bush 166
Bill Clinton 364
G.W. Bush 291
P.B.O. 182 seems quite restrained?
@ChuckGrassley @toddneeleyDTN THEN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AS A CONGRESS YOU USELESS BUNCH OF FUCKS
@ChuckGrassley you.are such an idiot.
@ChuckGrassley no they wanted a grand wizard that quacks.
@ChuckGrassley no ... they wanted slaves
@ChuckGrassley @Atrios How dare he want to immigration?!  Next he want to healthcare!
@ChuckGrassley This King nonsense is really starting to get old...why don't you all zip it and get to work like the rest of us...period!
@ChuckGrassley are you an idiot?
@ChuckGrassley @elisefoley So Chuck Grassley took to twitter to complain about something Obama can't legally do and won't do?  What a dope.
@ChuckGrassley No he doesn't. He wants YOU to do it, and if YOU woin't do your job, he will LEGALLY do his.
@ChuckGrassley @Atrios maybe you should have worked to convince the House to pass the bill the "Do Nothing Senate" passed.
@ChuckGrassley guessing the founders would be more surprised that the president is of a race they considered 3/5 of a human.
@ChuckGrassley why won't you tell your house colleagues to pass the bipartisan Senate immigration bill? He can't wait forever
Just like slavery by ExecOrder shld be up to ppl not King Lincln @ChuckGrassley
@ChuckGrassley he can't grant them permanent residency but he can delay deportations because of prosecutorial discretion
@ChuckGrassley @Atrios How many of GWB's 291 executive orders did you think were unconstitutional?  How many of Reagan's 381?
.@ChuckGrassley The Constitution Writers were a bunch of idiots.
@ChuckGrassley @JSmoothMV13 ooohhhh kill 'em
@ChuckGrassley @Atrios I thought this was a parody account. #FacePalm
@ChuckGrassley @elisefoley Nice soundbyte, Chuck. Try again.
.@chuckgrassley
@ChuckGrassley I think constitutional writers probably hoped for a Senator to be able to use punctuation and proper grammar
@ChuckGrassley I think he does.
@ChuckGrassley Zip it, Chuck. Being in the majority didn't make you any smarter.
@PreserveTheUSA @ChuckGrassley Yeah, and? Your family's okay and you want to pull up the ladder for everyone else? Got it.
@ChuckGrassley was Truman a king when he ended the segregated military by executive order?
@memefan2000 @ChuckGrassley To your point, was Lincoln a king when he signed the Emancipation Proclamation...by executive order
