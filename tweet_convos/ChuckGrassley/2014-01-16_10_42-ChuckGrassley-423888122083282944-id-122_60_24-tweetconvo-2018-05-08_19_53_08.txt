@ChuckGrassley Didn't know anyone in the Obama administration killed those 4 people. Have some decency!
@ChuckGrassley @anamariecox Neither case helps AMERICANS have safe water. Focus on the important stuff at home. #WVchemleak #WV
@ChuckGrassley @anamariecox For starters how about looking at who cut the funding for our embassies???
Jesus H. Christ, @ChuckGrassley can you really be that clueless? Good thing you don't have an important job or anything.
@ToddPM Bengahzi stuff, or the farm bill?
@hidama Benghazi--the absurd comparison. Also, NOBODY believes the people actually responsible for the bridge shutdown were fired.
@ToddPM Agreed - be interested to hear what else comes out of the investiagation of bridgegate in the next weeks.
@ChuckGrassley Who was fired after the '02 attack on US Consulate in Calcutta? Or the '02 attack in Karachi? Or 11 other attacks under Bush?
@jlerwin @ChuckGrassley Who showed such incompetence or lack of interest like under Obama? AT THIS POINT WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?
@FlatruckerFrank @ChuckGrassley so if an American dies, just wait five years? Despicable.
@jlerwin @ChuckGrassley  ?? What does that even mean? Wait for Hillary to run? Hold her responsible now. Would be the first time.
well, the whole 'consulate' was lost... @ChuckGrassley @GOPBlackChick only a few lanes of bridge were closed ?
@MartyLeft  CLOSED a #BRIDGE for a STUDY #OK ,@SenatorReid @SenateDems Closed #Parks #Memorials FOR NOTHING  It's the #DEMOCRATS at fault
and not even the whole bridge @tommy4usa @SenatorReid @SenateDems
@ChuckGrassley @AaronBlakeWP or to those that sent our soldiers to Iraq to die based on bad information.
@ChuckGrassley @AaronBlakeWP Because the the media is dishonest and partisan.
@ChuckGrassley @anamariecox State Dept isn't responsible for Benghazi, the terrorists are. Christie adm. actually planned/carried out bridge
@ChuckGrassley I was born/raised in CR. you are an embarrassment to all Iowans. I suggest you get therapy, learn self introspection, honesty
@ChuckGrassley More people resigned or took early retirement after Benghazi than the zero who did the same 9/11 or the Iraq fiasco.
@ChuckGrassley @brianbeutler He d/n fire anyone for shutdown, he d/n even ask that Q of them. Fired 1 for lying to him other for bad words
@ChuckGrassley Because Chris Christie is trying to cover up his involvement. WH has no such nefarious motive re Benghazi @anamariecox
@ChuckGrassley @anamariecox Governor Christie fired people for lying to him.
@ChuckGrassley Since Congress is ultimately responsible because of slashed security funding, you go first. @anamariecox
@ChuckGrassley @anamariecox Like the Congress? For cutting the State Dept.'s budget?
@ChuckGrassley Quit 
And go back to the 1800's
You have No ideas
@ChuckGrassley How many Senators were fired for the preventable deaths in Iraq? #grassley #glasshouses
@ChuckGrassley @anamariecox Benghazi, Benghazi, Benghazi, blah, blah, blah. Chuck, that train has already left the station.
@ChuckGrassley @anamariecox Can u spell-Change the subject, diversion & spin?
@ChuckGrassley because the closing of a bridge was deliberate retaliation by malicious aides & Benghazi was hostile attack by foreigners?
@ChuckGrassley One was an intentional abuse of power. The other was tragic event. The fact you're a US senator boggles the mind.
@ChuckGrassley @anamariecox seriously, you said that - seriously?
@ChuckGrassley @anamariecox Benghazi was mostly a CIA fuckup but the Republicans will never go after them.
@ChuckGrassley @anamariecox the same reason no one got punished when the same shit happened under Bush.
@ChuckGrassley @anamariecox State can't afford to fire them? Did you cut those funds from their budget TOO?
@ChuckGrassley @anamariecox How about the people who cut $100 million from State Dept budget the year before?
@ChuckGrassley Uh, because GWB shutdown was intentional? Go cash one of your bribe checks, Chuck, and buy yourself a brain.
@ChuckGrassley @anamariecox a Because that didn't happen last month. Let's revisit Beirut now, Senator.
@ChuckGrassley @anamariecox 
Benghazi, Benghazi. Republicans are destroying themselves with their obsession. Republicans, please proceed.
@ChuckGrassley Does that mean we can fire u 4 voting against extra funding 4 Embassy security? You're Fired!  @anamariecox
@ChuckGrassley Because the press has fact-check.
@ChuckGrassley @anamariecox that just isn't true. state dept jobs were taken and demoted. much tougher to fire bureaucrats under govt system
@ChuckGrassley @anamariecox Hey Grassley, why not pay attention to doing better job in Congress & forget about the press? #immigration
@ChuckGrassley people did resign u liar
@ChuckGrassley @anamariecox Because nobody in our government ordered the attack on Benghazi you dumb fuck. Christie ordered the closure.
Stop watching so much Faux News. You idiots are starting to believe your own lies. @ChuckGrassley
@ChuckGrassley because you can't fire congressppl or senators that cut the security budgets w/o elections then ppl forget @anamariecox
@ChuckGrassley @anamariecox Wouldn't they have to fire Congress for cutting embassy security budgets?
@ChuckGrassley @anamariecox Grassley your an idiot, and I mean that in the nicest way!
@ChuckGrassley @anamariecox Christies' firings was just posturing.
@ChuckGrassley @anamariecox How many people were fired over 9/11?
@ChuckGrassley @anamariecox How like Repubs, just fire anybody.Someone must be punished!!!
@ChuckGrassley @anamariecox So you're equating 4 dead with a traffic jam? Are you out of your mind???
I can never tell if @ChuckGrassley is a parody account or not... @AdamSerwer
@ChuckGrassley  Watching Fox again? Bad for the brain. #grassley
@ChuckGrassley AMEN!
@ChuckGrassley I'm pretty sure the attackers weren't employed by the State Department, soo...
@ChuckGrassley is it Opposite Day?
@ChuckGrassley that deer is dead,chuck.stop running it over.
@ChuckGrassley Hilary stepped down. We get to exact retribution on her w/ 2016 ballotbox. Also, Benghazi, like 9-11 was tragedy, not scandal
@ChuckGrassley why we're no Bush officials fired for 9/11?
@ChuckGrassley @AdamSerwer Because we can't "FIRE" Legislators for cutting funding for embassy security. Too bad, I would love to.
@ChuckGrassley Because the State Department doesn't have the power to fire Congress.
@ChuckGrassley Uh, senator? No one from the State Dept. attacked the Benghaz consulate. Christie's ppl actually closed the bridge lanes.
@ChuckGrassley @brianbeutler Why isn't anyone paying attention 2 Congresscritters who callously cut funding 4 embassy security? 
Oh, wait...
@ChuckGrassley @sahilkapur  Of course, like Christie's top staff, State Dept planned this attack on Amb Stevens, right Senator?
.@ChuckGrassley Welcome to the #DinosaurMedia Thunderdome. You have to speak fluent Coelacanth. #Benghazi #IRSabuse
@ChuckGrassley SHUT UP with your selective FAKE outrage. How many did Bush fire for many more embassy attacks AND 9/11!?
@ChuckGrassley @brianbeutler if someone planned the attack on Benghazi you might have a point. Since thats not the case and you dont, STFU.
@ChuckGrassley dipshit
.@ChuckGrassley And precisely how many State Department ppl did you demand be fired in the 13 embassy attacks (91 dead) during the Bush yrs?
.@ChuckGrassley Because the people *responsible* for Benghazi are Lybians, and obviously cannot be "fired" by the State Dept.
#idiot
@ChuckGrassley @brianbeutler I hope to God these come from low-level staffers. Surely a senator could not be this stupid.
@ChuckGrassley are you saying terrorists work for the State Department?
@ChuckGrassley give it a rest!
@ChuckGrassley that's b/c those responsible for #Benghazi were Libyans that don't work for the US government. @AaronBlakeWP
@ChuckGrassley @GOPBlackChick R U naïve? Media supports socialists and dictators .Remember 1938, Times Man Of Year was Hitler. That says all
@ChuckGrassley Excuse me? Does AQ work for the state department? You do understand that Christie fired people responsible don't you? Do you?
@ChuckGrassley @brianbeutler senility is a terrible thing, especially in a US Senator.
@ChuckGrassley Why can't you find anything else to talk about? Haven't you figured out yet that there are more important issues?
.@ChuckGrassley And it's Gov. *Christie*, you ass. If you're going to be snide, at least have the courtesy to get people's names correct.
.@ChuckGrassley @sahilkapur I’m guessing you were equally as vocal about 0 firings after 9/11. Oh, wait. You voted to promote Rice to State!
@ChuckGrassley where was all this outrage during any one of Bush's 11 Benghazis??
@ChuckGrassley Are you implying the attackers work for the state dept?
@ChuckGrassley How can you relate an attack on our embassy with a political move to keep people in New Jersey from work and school? Dopey.
@ChuckGrassley Because MOST Of the press are nothing more than Propaganda machines for @BarackObama and they don't care about this country.
.@ChuckGrassley The real scandal is the lack of firings amongst your staff that actually let you near your Twitter account.
@ChuckGrassley Are you suggesting State Dept people intentionally allowed the deaths in retribution for something vs. Ambassador?
@ChuckGrassley So, the terrorists haven't fired any members of their group? Huh.
@ChuckGrassley Because it's a ridiculous comparison - perhaps if that's so hard to grasp you are due to retire.
@ChuckGrassley People at State didn't actually carry out the attack. You do see the difference, don't you?
.@ChuckGrassley bridge was shut down to gain political advantage. Where's political advantage in what happened at Benghazi?
@ChuckGrassley Give it a rest.
@ChuckGrassley Gov Christie fired "people?" When is he going to fire HIMSELF for a deliberate federal crime? #bridgegate
.@ChuckGrassley Why are you cutting the diplomatic defense budget?
@ChuckGrassley Do you honestly think they are the same? No wonder Congress gets nothing done.
@ChuckGrassley bipartisan report puts to rest conspiracy theories re: #Benghazi http://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=f7a12d96-a314-40ba-9007-f7eac1313fcb … … …
@ChuckGrassley @GOPBlackChick Libs do not see evil of Libs, Intelack condition of Lib is permanent for this lifetime.
@chuckgrassley @brianbeutler Senator, did you vote increase, or decrease security funding for consulates before Benghazi?
@ChuckGrassley you're too dumb to be a Senator. Really.
@ChuckGrassley Benghazi was totally snubbed this year.
@ChuckGrassley Your #PantsBurnLegWound is flaring up, fogie.
@ChuckGrassley that would be like firing people for 911. It was a terrorist attack. Or do you think the state dept ordered the attack
@ChuckGrassley Ppl in NJ intentionally caused harm to NJ residents.
.@ChuckGrassley And heaven knows, Benghazi is too good a scandal to waste! #Amirite
@ChuckGrassley Incorrect. http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/20/us/politics/3-state-dept-officials-resign-following-benghazi-report.html …
@ChuckGrassley How many people got fired for 9/11 again?
@ChuckGrassley @AdamSerwer You can't tell the difference?  And you're in Congress???
@ChuckGrassley trafficfirelegmedia
@ChuckGrassley @AdamSerwer Rice already took political fall for it silly
@rabsafari @ChuckGrassley @AdamSerwer by getting promoted to National Security Advisor. What a joke.
@ChuckGrassley @GOPBlackChick Sadly WH doesn't hold anyone accountable for anything. They are very heartless in so many ways. #SlapInTheFace
@ChuckGrassley no one at state department ordered benghazi attack for political vengeance. very different situations
@ChuckGrassley  CLOSED a #BRIDGE for a STUDY #OK ,@SenatorReid @SenateDems Closed #Parks #Memorials FOR #NOTHING  It's the #DEMOCRATS fault
@ChuckGrassley @AdamSerwer derp
@ChuckGrassley ......because Benghazi wasn't done on purpose
.@ChuckGrassley You weren't this tenacious with regard to the failures of the Bush Administration. #hypocrite
@ChuckGrassley @GOPBlackChick Christie isn't a Dem yet. Media owned by DNC
@chuckgrassley Poor Ben.
