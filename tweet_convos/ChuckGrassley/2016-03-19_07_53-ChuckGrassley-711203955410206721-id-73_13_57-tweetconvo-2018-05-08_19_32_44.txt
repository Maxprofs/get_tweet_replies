@ChuckGrassley Do your job.  Help select a new Supreme Court Justice.  Forget about tweeting trivia.
@ChuckGrassley Nothing wrong with sharing Iowa sports news if you are also remembering to #DoYourJob on  #SCOTUSnominee Hold hearings & vote
@ChuckGrassley You're gonna have so much time for sports channels when you lose your senate campaign. #DoYourJob
@zachbraff so you're saying @ChuckGrassley winning his senate seat again is a longer shot than the one he watched last night? #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley Good evening Senator! I know you have been watching bball. FYI your VM is full. #DoYourJob #SCOTUSnominee #WeNeedNine 
@ChuckGrassley Your job is obstruction?
@ChuckGrassley Hey, how about you #doyourjob? Remember.. the one OUR taxes pay you with..?
@ChuckGrassley  #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley nice try at covering your glaring faults. "Sports! I'm just like you guys!" YOU CLOWN. DO YOUR DAMN JOB!!!
@ChuckGrassley no thanks, I work for a living.  Do you? #doyourjob
@ChuckGrassley Sports are entertaining, but lets review your income and net worth numbers. Somethings don't add up and you could clarify.
@ChuckGrassley You should be more concerned with doing your job. Hold the SCOTUS hearing and stop this obstructionism.
@ChuckGrassley  Forget that. #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley Nice you're trying to be a man of the people, Senator, but men of the people do their jobs.
@ChuckGrassley Please no Supreme Court appointment until after the election.
@ChuckGrassley Got nothing to do today, huh?  Could you make some time, perhaps, for your constitutional duty? #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley how about you hold off wasting time on TV until you do your job? We shouldn't have to beg you to work. #SCOTUSnominee
@ChuckGrassley if you missed Bush v Gore crisis, maybe we can get a repeat in 2016, except this one ends in a tie. #DoYourJob

@ChuckGrassley  Are you going to watch sports, or fiddle while America burns? #DoYourJob
