Even the esteemed judiciary committee isn't privy to everything classified or not.
You old traitor fence sitter
Big Ag poisoner
Iowa is a gangsta hideout
Pack your bags

Civil/Race War

huh?
Exactly. Is Trump the businessman?  Is Grassley the tool? Isn't Trump a tool, also? 
they we both tools, the Grassley tool doesn't have the balls to speak to the orange took directly
You mean nuts. He's all bolts, no nuts.
The mystery continues to unfold.
-Retire, you are the reason we need term limits!  I stand with our Pres. Donald Trump!
You are the swamp. We NEED term limits.
yeah he gets away way to much
Who took over YOUR twitter account? You're worse than @potus!  btw plse cancel H1B and L1
Are you getting nervous about your upcoming Town Hall meetings? Is that what these tweets are about? Your votes speak louder.
that was my guess. He sees how it went for @jasoninthehouse and now he is scared to come home
he won't  have any where he'll get tough questions. Just friendly rural. Scared
nah there are plenty of pissed people. I can be polite & still ask tough questions

@POTUS WITH you Senator !
Mr.  Grassley, can you stop from terrting?, is a SHAME to have a person in the WH acting like a child. So sad, heis not my pr
You realize YOU are part of the swamp, right? Old, establishment guard needs to go!
@realDonaldTrump How disrespectful! Typical from the swamp

Can you shut up about the businessman stuff.  He is your President.  Show some respect.
@ChuckGrassleyShutUp Whoever monitors Chuck Grassly please tell him to shut up.
Drain the swamp? He IS the swamp
@POTUS @FLOTUS @StephenBannon @realDonaldTrump @DanScavino
Do you ever see President Trump?  Does he have an open door policy? Make a list and go ask him your questions!
ChuckGrassley you need to.go home for sure.   Too old to be doing this stop now and go home.
Regards from one not educated beyond their intelligence.
Remember Henry Hyde. I know you do. Too bad there isn't a serious look here in North Carolina Another pass for the Clintons?
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @KellyannePolls  WHY IS NO ONE ANSWERING CHUCK? He pretended to Tweet the WH all weekend
Maybe if you ask the #NRA to give Trump a big donation .. it works for you and the rest your shills #PayToPlay
Seriously? Why don't you start using power of your office to get his attention? Hold up his nominees!Do something!Constituent
I think he has been hacked, man. Are you okay Chuck?
I wish you were so vigilant about transparency during the dark period known as the Obama WH. so proud of your friendly fire
has your account been hacked?
Hire all whistle blowers drain the swamp in seconds
@jaketapper Who is the businessman here, and who is the tool?
@realdonaldtrump He's attacking 1st amendment has GAG ORDER to Gov. employees.  USES SECRECY TO CLOAK ATTACKS ON OUR FREEDOMS
You're barking up the wrong tree if you think Team Trump will respond to these arcane tweets.
now you care? Didn't u vote to fill the swamp with big monsters
Where is our constitution in this cass
I don't think the guy notorious for not even paying workers is concerned with whistle-blowers' wellbeing.
Has your account been hacked? Or are you seriously asking this string of odd questions? Should we be concerned about you?
I hear Trump responds faster on Facebook than twitter. Maybe try that for your official communication?
DAN SCAVINO HANDLES SOCIAL MEDIA FOR POTUS @Scavino45
.@ChuckGrassley Empty rhetoric. You could help drain the swamp with YOUR VOTE. You used it to confirm swamp dwellers DeVos, Sessions, et al.
Speaking of accountability, remember when @ChuckGrassley voted to confirm Betsy DeVos to education secretary despite zero qualification $$$$
or when he failed to follow historic precedent and DO HIS JOB as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 2016?
I don't want to see Senators making the same tweets that I would make. Get your ass to Washington and change things right way
hey @spicysean1971 @realLordBannon @miketwopence Did we find out who monitors swamp whistles at @WhiteHouse for this guy yet?
.@ChuckGrassley Whoever monitors Twitter for Sen Grassley get on subject of listening to all constituents in Iowa. Tell him open 99 mtgs.
@rjmaclean Does anyone "really" care about those us who blow the whistle and get beat for it?  Fire the top 5 layers at TSA
You have him a Supreme Court pick and now you're tweeting to get his attention? Not buying it.
Whoever monitors Grassleys twitter tell him actions speak a hell of a lot louder than words.
Ask @melissamccarthy to ask @alecbaldwin  to ask #PresidentBannon
What the hell is going on over there, Chuck?
A little early to be hitting the sauce?? Will that be your excuse for DeVos vote? Your party better man up Reign in Trump
For crying out loud. You are chair of judiciary committee. Put on your big pants and get an appointment w Pres Bannon
How about releasing Trump's tax returns? The American people have a right to know if Russia owns him or not!
Hey President Bannon and Donald: LOOK AT ME!!! I CAN TWEET LIKE A BUFFOON too! 
#DonnieTalks2Russia
i think your account was hacked?
I gather @realDonaldTrump monitors Twitter. Do you support whistleblower reforms in US #opengov plan? https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/final_us_open_government_national_action_plan_3_0.pdf …
this sounds like a good plan to me
Maybe Sen. Grassley has been hacked?
#doyourjob #merrickgarland
To @ChuckGrassley - Should't we be very concerned about POTUS attacks on the judiciary and Constitution ? 
This isn't like you. Have you been hacked?
.@ChuckGrassley this tweet is A+ vintage Grassley! Well done! 
Trump is the businessman & major tool in the shed.
 yes !!!
???
@jaketapper maybe chuck can tell America why our state is trying to get rid of chapter 20 bargaining??
@jaketapper    @realDonaldTrump doesn't call them "Whistleblowers", he calls them "Leaks"
Huh?
this can't be chuck. Lol
Pretty safe to say trump thinks whistleblowers are fake news.
Instead of watching basketball, do your job and answer to your constituents.
This sentence is utterly incoherent. People vote for you??
This infuriates me. You were given power by the people who voted for you & this is how you represent them. You tweet? 1/
.@ChuckGrassley Bad enough we have an authoritarian demagogue who thinks he can run the country by a tweet but no more. Act or shut up. /2
Agree, sir, but has even Reince stopped taking your calls?
he will not listen to you, need to find tools that will force him, use courts, lawyers.
Sounds like Drunk Tweeting
The issue is that I don't think he has any intention to protect whistleblowers
what r u doing to stop this Chaos? Investigating hack, looking in to trump/Russian ties, subpoena taxes, Ethics charges?
ANYTHING! We are fed up, we are angry, we want these things done NOW! No gaslighting, no canned responses, protests continue
hmm why not tweet POTUS instead of grandstanding on your TL?
you reap what you helped sow Chuck. Can you look people in the eye and say you are proud??
@jaketapper whatever
Silence = corruption. Investigate trmp/Russia connections or you are corrupt.
you can't play nice with BLOTUS Senator #doyourjob
Why didn't you stand up for @SenWarren when @realDonaldTrump impugned her name? Hypocrite
you could just call your Congressman.
twitter lesson: instead of "Whoever monitors twitter at the WH 4PresTrump" type @realDonaldTrump #getwithit
lol
Just a FYI - Your tweets r going no where. Use @POTUS or @realDonaldTrump. perhaps @SeanSpicerWH @seanspicer @KellyannePolls
I don't understand. Are you calling @realDonaldTrump a tool, or yourself?
.@ChuckGrassley Why don't you tell him that yourself?
@jaketapper Thus can't be Grassley the tweeter has too much integrity. FAKE TWEETS
WH So. Needs registry Rybolovev golfing w/POTUS today study @LouiseMensch @Khanoisseur Country b 4 party
can we talk about Flynn? What are you going to do to investigate treason?
Did you lose your phone? This sequence of tweets is pretty weird!
go on TV, you have a better chance of #RussianAsset @POTUS getting you message, or you could just call Putin
@jaketapper What does this even mean? Is the Sen referring to himself as a "tool"?
The President nor the White House follows you, so they aren't seeing your tweets or is that how you want it? Is this for show
@jaketapper
CNN boots Bernie off air after he jokingly calls them "fake news". 
just coving ur behind or r u really gonna do something
What?
Are you having some sort of breakdown???
@jaketapper Good Lord sir, what are you on? Incomprehensible.
it might help visibility at the WH twitter if you used the @ of who you're trying to get attention from.
sir have you been hacked
Whoever monitors Twitter at Chuck Grassley's office, please explain Twitter to Chuck & check his meds
Imma need a translation. WUT?
we will be at your Northern Iowa town hall! ACA DeVos. Planned Parenthood Sessions. Can't wait to see 
@jaketapper did the Senator just call the President a "tool"?
Don't see where you actually tweeted POTUS or the white house, but would welcome your speaking publicly on this matter.
we can now confirm you are unable to have a face to face with the president, correct? That is fairly worrisome.
.@ChuckGrassley Can't argue with that one!
I am an Iowa voter. I didn't vote for you last time. But will next time if you keep this up.
Next time?? Good God, the guy is nearing 90!
@jaketapper uh try copying the President??? @realDonaldTrump
@jaketapper Mr. Grassley you are an embarrassment to Iowa.
This is one of @POTUS R supporters, right? Hey @jasoninthehouse might be time for you to #DoYourJob
Maybe you should... tell him yourself? You're a fairly powerful Senator from the same party...
right?! Pretty sure he bragged about being 4th in seniority @ inauguration
have you scheduled Merrick Garland's hearing yet? Democracy matters
If we want to drain the swamp you are one of the first that needs to go.
@jaketapper Pride of Iowa right here
I really think chuck is drunk again. Quite the drinker old chuck is!
This is so sad and pathetic. Begging "whoever"
What? This is slightly incoherent. And: do you think his Twitter monitor is reading your tweets? Try that '@' thing, bro.
@jaketapper @jasoninthehouse  #DoYourJob #investigatetrump #russianhacking #conflictsofinterest pick a topic, and #justdoit
@jaketapper grassley is a piece of garbage that takes dirty money to imprison poor people for cannabis possession. Get rid of
.@ChuckGrassley It's about time you say something. What took so long?
go home Chuck, you are drunk
was Obamas administration transparent?
Hacked?
Did Russia hack your account, Chuck?
Grassley for whistleblowers? Refreshing words.
kick his ass, man. you know if you don't, he's gonna take you down with him. do the right thing. why i got to tell you this?
Stand by for the "I was hacked" press release...
exactly
Either your account or your brain has been hacked
Friends don't let friends drink & tweet
@jaketapper I hope your days are numbered as they should be.
Time to air the dirty laundry and get honest people in power
Too little, too late. Good grief. Not many of us actually believe you work for Iowans or care about our needs.
drain the swamp? You helped help it full and added more shit to it! #StandUpToTrump
He does watch a lot of TV, maybe he'd listen if you got on TV? Just a suggestion...
if only you had a job that granted you personal access to the president of the united states!!!
Anyone check on this guy yet? Hope he's ok.
WH is not interested in draining swamp or protection of whistleblowers. WILL scapegoat them. DO UR JOB INVESTIGATE TRUMP
and you are in charge of who does what job at WH?
have you been drinking again? Or just new to the twitter?
This is incomprehensible word salad.  Please rephrase for coherence.
.@ChuckGrassley Trump is the swamp!
Pence and Flynn lie about talks with Russia prior to inauguration and u say/do nothing.  How do u sleep at night
He's nearly 90. How does he stay awake during the day?
Are you saying protect Snowden and more governance via tweet?  Or have you just been drinking??
This is some classic Grassley shit right here...
There's no swamp draining. You and others in the GOP helped him set up a metaphorical EPA to protect the swamp!
It is also used to organize small towns as a tool, but that is beyond your imagination.
scavino is golfing with him now dude
can someone say #retirement? You have already damaged the nation and wiped your ass with the #USConstitution enough. #GOP
It's YOUR job as a sitting senator, member of Congress, to hold the president accountable! Stop making nice and DO YOUR JOB!
@Bencjacobs Sounds like someone is not returning Chuck's phone calls
i think a Senator in R party would have more influence than Tweets. U cant talk to him obviously.
What are you trying to say?  Sounds confused! Why are you yelling?
What makes you think Trump is interested in transparency or accountability?
thank you! #kingtrump @POTUS can even be transparent w/ his companies or taxes. The swamp is now only murkier!
@RaulieGonzo WUT
= @realDonaldTrump   You're falling in line and not standing up for IA. So stop pretending; getting old.
you're pathetic
$21k to say yes is not exactly draining the swamp. Regardless of politics no position should be bought.
dude, go home, you're drunk.  I can't even make fun of you today when you make it no fun for me.  #sad
his process of bringing in rich business people, not necessarily qualified people, makes it feel like that's not his plan now
How about starting a custom logo for your business? Check our website here!
What?
??? Please rewrite in understandable English.
He's no longer a businessman. He's now your President. BTW, how was BHO on whistleblowers? http://m.huffpost.com/us/news/obama-whistleblowers …    #twit
I'm guessing this isn't him tweeting....
It is. His twitter has some amazing garbled messages.

Confusing also cuz it doesn't seem pro- 45 ? But who knows what he's saying
Total agree. Very confusing message.
God bless you Chuck!
