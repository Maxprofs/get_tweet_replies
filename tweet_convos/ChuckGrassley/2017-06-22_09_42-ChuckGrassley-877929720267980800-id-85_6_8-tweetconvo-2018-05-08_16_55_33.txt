Shifting dollars from the poor to the rich is a key part of the Senate health bill. http://nyti.ms/2t0X6BD 
Funny that you aren't proud to talk about the #AHCA https://twitter.com/topherspiro/status/877994824779022336 …

For working class in WV, AR, NV & AK, is it more important to be able to go to the doctor or to cut taxes on top 400? For their Senators?

You're a coward Chuck
must be nice to know you have health care. Your all less than human and all your money won't buy forgiveness
You don't care, do you Chuck? As long as you get your tax break right? #DeathByGOP
He doesn't care. We pay for his insurance.
Coward.

Not exactly "Profiles in Courage," Senator. What a disgrace.
Shame on you!
Being heartless and supporting a bill that hurts so many people is NOT the moral thing to do. Do the right thing and help the people!!
3 million children will lose coverage under your plan. Millions more will suffer from annual/lifetime caps.What if this was your grandchild?
@chuckgrasley doesn't care. All he cares about is cutting taxes for his rich friends and screwing over the poor. He is not a real Christian.
shameful human being. Money is your God. Go like cancer kids in eye and tell them you don't give a damn.
Why don't you care that Russia was 1 step away from changing votes in the last presidential election? Perhaps they did change some votes.
Coward
What are you doing? Posting pics of people whose healthcare you're going to take away to enrich your friends?
it's clear you don't have a care in the world for people less fortunate than you-at least own it #shame #GOP #AHCA
You realize the reason why you feel it's necessary to walk away from the public when they ask you about ACA is because you know your wrong

My dad would have said that you are as useless as teats on a boar hog, for all of the care you show low income seniors, if you vote for this
#Health"Care"Cowards
Stop posting photos of you fake smiling while behind the scenes you're destroying people's lives.
you should be ashamed and pray for forgiveness for maybe killing thousands of people. Your old your time is coming.
Coward https://twitter.com/TopherSpiro/status/877994824779022336 …
nothing wrong for standing up for what your heart knows is right. we are all Americans. and we care for you. stand up to whats right

So this is 'Death Squad' they claimed in ACA - but wasn't. GOP made sure it's included in AHCA. Well, trump duznt have use for 'poor' ppl. https://twitter.com/grant_wiant/status/878071114425028608 …
Senator... crickets all day. You have followers here. We want to know your position on BCRA. ASAP. Thanks in advance.
Approached by constituents about health care, "Iowa Senator immediately walked away." Craven, pathetic excuse for a "leader" given power.
In the twilight of your career, you can afford to do the nobel and ethical things that you didn't do in your youth.  No to AHCA.
I see that your "death panel" remark is finally true, 8 years later.
It screws the poorest Americans by allowing caps on lifetime coverage. So basically let's insurance companies pull the plug on patients 3/ 
Why you running and hiding? You know what you're doing is wrong and not what humans, taxpayers and children need. You must be heartless.
If this health care bill is passed I see lots of senators retiring in 2018.
please have some courage and vote against wealthcare.  don't betray the american people.
You should be deeply ashamed of your support for the #AHCA
Sen. PLEASE DON'T BETRAY IOWANS WHO NEED MEDICARE!!!
You're a coward for dodging questions about AHCA. Either vote against it or take a hike!
#VoteThemOut
Please listen to your constituents like @shriver_amy & me about the AHCA. Medicaid cuts are a disaster for IA kids.
Here's my video to #KeepKidsCovered 
You can't even answer basic questions about your healthcare bill.
You are a servant of the people. You should be ashamed of yourself.
The ACA is the ONLY reason that this small EMPLOYER of 19 years can offer HEALTH CARE to my EMPLOYEES.  Too much $$ before!
I urge you to take action against your party's healthcare bill, both for your electoral interests and the interests of the Iowa's people.
No one cares. Please stop spewing lies about ACA "failing" when you know repubs are doing everything in their power to sabotage it. FIX IT!!
Please don't support the #TrumpCare bill. My premium would be >45% of my income. My disabled son will lose his coverage. Please help.
Who cares? Vote no on #AHCA
Governance by instagram links? Please do better. What issues are you motivated to tackle? What are your positions? How about health care?
Yep. If Viagra is covered, they DAMN WELL BETTER COVER BIRTH CONTROL TOO!
Chances are you are voting to strip healthcare coverage away from at least one of them. Nice work Chuck.
Thank you, senator for exposing Mr. Comey.
Slobbering idiot.
Stop harassing Comey
Let Mueller do his job
Don't care. Vote "No" on #AHCA. #ImpeachTrumpNOW
Do you hate children and the disabled? If not, oppose the Senate horrible version of the AHCA.
