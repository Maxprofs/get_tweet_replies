@ChuckGrassley That's the first time I understood and agreed with you sir.
@140elect @ChuckGrassley Scary when that happens, isn't it?
@ChuckGrassley @chrislhayes Did he miss-speak? Is he ill? Who's blackmailing him in2 saying that?
@ChuckGrassley Wow a Republican with a brain
@ChuckGrassley @chrislhayes wait a minute, is Grassley just punking us lefties now?
@ChuckGrassley WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH CHUCK GRASSLEY? @LindaLacey8
@ChuckGrassley Whats new? You politicians been screwin us forever. See S.S. where does all the money go when people die before collecting?
@ChuckGrassley @chrislhayes What about closing a loophole allowing congressmen to take subsidies while still in office
@ChuckGrassley Wasn't this a Republican bill. Pushed by Republicans. Pass by all and mostly Republicans? #GovernmentWaste #farmbill @msnbc
@ChuckGrassley @StopTheCrazies1 Raise the minimum wage.. you helped write the farm bill.. stop pretending it's a foreign language to you..
@ChuckGrassley Wow Senator. I agree Sir. But if U truly believe this, then actions speak louder than words! Restore SNAP!
@ChuckGrassley Wow this actually made sense for once.
Umm. @ChuckGrassley just said something (re:farm bill) that I wholeheartedly agree with. Quick! Take his temperature!
@ChuckGrassley a tweet senator Kennedy would've appreciated for sure @emkinstitute
@ChuckGrassley
@ChuckGrassley
@ChuckGrassley @chrislhayes Is he up for election? This don't even look write as a tweet from the Senator
@ChuckGrassley @140elect So what, exactly will you do about it?
@ChuckGrassley @chrislhayes what loopholes for food stamps?
.@ChuckGrassley @chrislhayes Yes. But #SNAP cuts are not "closing loopholes." They are severe hunger & nutrition program cuts. @fractweets
@ChuckGrassley close both.
.@ChuckGrassley this seems like a good thing to bring up on the floor of the Senate instead of on Twitter?
@ChuckGrassley I don't often agree with you, Senator, but this seems like an appropriate time. #p2 #UniteBlue #tcot
@ChuckGrassley whoa!!! Way to go Chuck! The 1st thing you've said since 2010 this Iowan hasnt been embarrassed of.
@ChuckGrassley holy shit I agree with a Republican farmer!
@ChuckGrassley  Right. Fight tea party.
@ChuckGrassley Just another example of corporate welfare and wealth redistribution upward of the last 34 yes.
@ChuckGrassley   u answer to the highest bidder just like the rest of congress. #corruption
@ChuckGrassley aren't we in a time when farmers don't need subsidies?  By in a time I mean the country has no money.
What are food stamp loopholes?   Do you have a link to credible information that explains them? @ChuckGrassley
@ChuckGrassley @140elect Wow. Something you said is sensible,
@ChuckGrassley: Stop pointing out problems and fix things! If you're saying that you don't think you have the competence, then resign.
@ChuckGrassley Announcement he is retiring in  ...3...2...1!
@ChuckGrassley @chrislhayes my jaw just hit the floor.
@ChuckGrassley @chrislhayes   too little to late still going to vote you out

@chrislhayes @ChuckGrassley are you taking about ethanol subsidies?
@ChuckGrassley @chrislhayes Wow! Look who finally got a visit from the common sense fairy!
@ChuckGrassley @chrislhayes It's been business as usual with the #FarmBill too long. Now you do this to my homeland.
@ChuckGrassley @chrislhayes And aren't there members of Congress (!) who are farmers and are still getting paid AS farmers? That's nuts.
@ChuckGrassley @chrislhayes Chuck, I had to read this 3 times to make sure that wasn't some hidden right wing message.
Wonder what affect this will have on Steve King's cantaloupe calves? @ChuckGrassley @chrislhayes
@ChuckGrassley @chrislhayes Your evil old ass is a bad way to do government. Go the hell home, demon!
@ChuckGrassley GOVT IS NOT A BIZ, DON'T INSULT US TALKING ABT THE WRONG WAY TO DO BIZ! IT'S WRONG TO KILL UR NATIONS KIDS FOR BIZ GOPROFIT!
@ChuckGrassley for once I sgree with you.
@ChuckGrassley REPUBLICANS EXPLOIT TAXPAYERS & KILL THEIR KIDS FOR GOPROFIT! THEY DUMP HUGE DEBT ON AMERICANS THAT DEMS PAY & GOP DENIES! BS
@ChuckGrassley Careful Chuck. That sounds kinda Liberal for you! Don't want the tea party to turn on you. #takers
@ChuckGrassley ARROGANT IGNORANT REPUBLICANS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TRAITORS. THRU HISTORY THEY RACKED UP HUGE DEBT THEY DIDN'T PAY A FKG DIME OF!
@ChuckGrassley HOW DARE YOU PRETEND TO SUPPORT ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE FASCIST R/W CHRISTIAN FRAUD USED TO LOOT TAXPAYERS & KILL THEIR KIDS!
@ChuckGrassley SAID THE REPUBLICAN THAT VOTED FOR THE FARM BILLS BUT NOT FOR JOBS OR VETS OR SENIORS OR CHILDREN OR ANY OF THE AMERICAN PPL!
@ChuckGrassley @beacongal Senator, take the lead in Congress.
@ChuckGrassley We agree on that for sure, fix it.
.@ChuckGrassley I disagree with you on many, many things, but on this I agree. Good job. Still ain't gonna vote for you though. ;-)
@ChuckGrassley OK, who hacked this account & what you do w/ the Senator?
@ChuckGrassley Wow, I agree. Hell has frozen over.
Interesting @ChuckGrassley tweet. Would be interested in hearing @RepHartzler's thoughts. https://twitter.com/chuckgrassley/status/419955765060055040 … #farmbill
To close loopholes in FarmBill for food stamps & leave open loopholes for the biggest farmers to exploit taxpayers=wrong way to do business
@ChuckGrassley so stop doing business that way. Stop all subsidies.  Pass Fair Tax.
@ChuckGrassley Holy shit, for once I think I agree with something you said.
@ChuckGrassley: Chuck you are absolutely correct,  but since this is clearly commie talk expect to be primary-ed if you ever run again. #GOP
@ChuckGrassley Separate True Farm Bill from Welfare Wealth Redistribution bill should not be combined into one bill. . Food stamps & Farmers
