@ChuckGrassley Thanks for your leadership Sen Grassley and letting the people have a voice this Nov on replacing Scalia #SCOTUS
@Garymarx @ChuckGrassley Didn't we have a voice in 2012? You just disagree with that voice so you dismiss it.
@buffsblg @Garymarx @ChuckGrassley Our voice in 2014 gave Republicans the Senate and put Sen.Grassley in charge of the judiciary committee.
@IamTheSherm @buffsblg @Garymarx @ChuckGrassley great, he's head of the committee. Now, actually #DoYourJob.
@Kwyjibo68 @buffsblg @Garymarx @ChuckGrassley He is doing his job. SCOTUS has 8 other justices, and the Senate has other business.
@IamTheSherm @Kwyjibo68 @Garymarx @ChuckGrassley even Grassley isn't silly enough to claim that it's the press of business.
@buffsblg @Kwyjibo68 @Garymarx @ChuckGrassley Nope. It's the fact that the Constitution gives the Senate the power to block appointments.
@IamTheSherm @Kwyjibo68 @Garymarx @ChuckGrassley Sure. But don't claim it's based on anything but pure partisan politics.
@ChuckGrassley All of these #DoYourJob ppl would be singing a different tune if a Republican were in office. You're doing your job. Thanks!
@RLeePip @ChuckGrassley Nope. I don’t care which party is in which role, we don’t pay the government to be obstructive.
@DukeOfVinings If legislation in the Senate called for the immediate deportation of all here illegally, would you want the Dems to obstruct?
@RLeePip participate is inappropriate.
@DukeOfVinings Your opinion does not equal fact. Republican judicial app'ts have been turned away by Democrats without a vote. Estrada was 1
@RLeePip As I said to begin with, I don’t care about partisan bs-refusing to consider a presidential appointment is a dereliction of duty
@DukeOfVinings But it's OK when Democrats do it, right?
@RLeePip Yes despite my saying the opposite several times, what I really meant was Dems can do whatever. Please learn reading comprehension
@ChuckGrassley We made our voice heard in 2012 when we easily elected Obama to a FOUR year term. Not 3, FOUR. #doyourjob
@philedgrif We made our voice heard when we gave the Senate to the Republican party, and @ChuckGrassley the chairman of the Judiciary comm.
@IamTheSherm Totally agree, so have a hearing and vote him down. Not even considering him is pathetically partisan.
@philedgrif Voting him down would just get someone else nominated. They want no appointments until after the election, which is fine by me.
@IamTheSherm nominating the next Justice. You may wish they'd have confirmed Garland if Clinton nominates someone to the left of him....
@philedgrif Obviously. But that's a risk they are willing to take. The Supreme Court is not a major concern of mine. 5-4 decisions are rare.
@ChuckGrassley Our Supreme Court is doing a great job, however #WeNeedNine
@ChuckGrassley I support your position with the Supreme Court justice
@ChuckGrassley @senjudiciary Stop playing politics and give Judge Garland a Hearing.  THAT IS YOUR JOB SENATOR!
@ChuckGrassley was the explanation: "I'm a coward and I refuse to work"? #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley Outrageous that you won't give Judge Garland a hearing and vote in the Senate.  UnAmerican and just plain wrong!
@ChuckGrassley Impressed you met with him, and that you had the guts to look him in the eye and tell him you wouldn't be doing your job.
@ChuckGrassley thank you. He's not right for our country. Hold to your guns. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
@ChuckGrassley President.
@ChuckGrassley time to go chucky born in 1933 that was before light was invented . Stop milking us #DoYourJob . Off t pasture now
@ChuckGrassley The Constitution comes before party. You are paid by the taxpayer to uphold your Oath. #Garland
@ChuckGrassley why don't you explain it to the American people?#DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley The ppl had a voice twice in 2008 and 2012, do your job, You all are going to regret this in Nov.
@ChuckGrassley Wow, it takes guts to tell someone you refuse to do your job,
I'm glad you're a decent person, @ChuckGrassley, but now it's time to be a decent politician. #DoYourJob #SCOTUS
@ChuckGrassley as an Iowa voter, I'm ashamed of what Sen. Grassley is doing.
People decided in 2012. I hope ppl  are heard in 2016 and vote out obstructionists like you. Unite blue vote @pattyforiowa
@ChuckGrassley because you’re a chamber of lazy hypocrites? Embarrassing conversation I’m sure.
@07Kevin11
@ChuckGrassley You and you colleagues earn $173,000.00 per year.  Please #DoYourJob, then vote yes or no.
@ChuckGrassley  ....so you explained that GOP is not moving forward  because they're still upset a black man was elected president?
@ChuckGrassley #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley lame duck Senator
@ChuckGrassley So how did Judge Garland react when you told him you won't move forward because you're a partisan tittybaby?
.@ChuckGrassley Iowans had breakfast too, with a message for you: #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley Constituion does not mandate obstruction. Hold hearings and reject nominee is more honorable than this game you're playing.
@ChuckGrassley Nothing has changed. DO YOUR DAMN JOB. Have a hearing. Stop making this appointment political. You should be recalled.
@ChuckGrassley Grassley is a idiot, he doesn't even know what his job is, he is he racist bigot, we voted for Obama and he still the
.@ChuckGrassley #DoYourJob That is what #WeThePeople  pay you for
@ChuckGrassley because you refuse to do your job. #grassleyforretirement2016
@ChuckGrassley you're treating President Obama as if he is only 3/5 of a president.
@ChuckGrassley Wait...I didn't have a voice when I voted for President in 2012?
@ChuckGrassley The people had their say when they elected President Obama for two terms!  Get with the American people and do your job!!!!!
@ChuckGrassley you should give Garland his hearing, quit holding up progress
@ChuckGrassley People are too kind here. Follow the constitution you sniveling piece of shit.
@ChuckGrassley people had their voice in 2012. #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley Where's the compromise? Work together. You still have 3/4 of a year to select someone for #SCOTUS . Listen to the people.
@ChuckGrassley There is no WHY. There is only DO. THIS is why the people don't like politics. It should be FIGURE IT OUT. #SCOTUS
@ChuckGrassley another example of republicans shooting themselves in the foot. Imagine if the shoe was on the other foot.
@ChuckGrassley embarrassing Iowans on a global level.
@ChuckGrassley because you've become a political hack. Doddering to the partisan end - retire Chuck.
@ChuckGrassley Do your job. Just pathetic.
@ChuckGrassley #DoYourJob-it's your sworn Constitutional duty.
@ChuckGrassley no one has ever had a pleasant breakfast with you in attendance. #pantsburnlegwound
@ChuckGrassley Ppl had a voice in 2008. Do your job! He deserves a hearing. #SCOTUSnominee
@ChuckGrassley Do your fucking job, asshole.
@ChuckGrassley Can you explain to us, your IA voters, why you think you know better than the Constitution? Pres did his job, now #DoYourJob.
@ChuckGrassley the people made their voice in 2012. Quit being a racist and disrespecting our president. hope you lose in Nov #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley You're setting a dangerous precedent with this #SCOTUSnominee. You're also alienating a generation of voters. #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley Have you been lying?????@cnn@fox@nbc
@ChuckGrassley #DoYourJob or step down. Stop trashing the Constitution.
@ChuckGrassley #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley will not be voting for you again this term.  #stubborn GOP #tooold
@ChuckGrassley Playing politics is hindering the court from doing its job. Real cases are being delayed. Justice delayed is justice denied.
@ChuckGrassley You obstructionists are too much. Give him a hearing and up/down vote. If you don't want him vote no but #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley there is no moral or rational justification for your hyper-partisan obstruction. #DoYourJob #SCOTUS #GRASSLEY
@ChuckGrassley It's time for you to go. You're an embarrassment to Iowa. #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley the entire GOP is going to be taught a severe lesson once the voters have their say. We've had ENOUGH of GOP obstructionism!
@ChuckGrassley And an inaccurate, stupid, unconstitutional explanation it was. #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley Do your job.
@ChuckGrassley #doyourjob I hope Iowans do their job when your turn is up and vote your lazy butt out of office.
@ChuckGrassley What kind of pusillanimous stunt is this?!
@ChuckGrassley US Senate Judiciary Chm. Grassley tells Garland no hearings. Dusgraceful! Vote him out of office for refusal to do his job.
@jimj02155 @ChuckGrassley  TYPICAL REPUBLICAN DO NOTHING SCREW THE PEOPLE , GRASSLEY THE ASSLEY !!!!!!!! DO YOUR JOB FAKE FARMER .
@ChuckGrassley I am an Iowa voter, and I am extremely disappointed in you because of your handling of the Garland nomination. #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley sticks thumb in your eye and posts picture of it. Chutzpa squared.
@ChuckGrassley Thanks for meeting with Pat Hall and me last week.  Iowa HSEMD appreciates the great work you do!
@ChuckGrassley  you explained not doing your job? Saying the next Prez and the people should have a voice is total BS. People voted twice.
@ChuckGrassley #DoYourJob Grassley, or we'll find someone else who will
.@ChuckGrassley What's it feel like to trash your oath to uphold US Constitution? #DoYourJob #SCOTUS #SCOTUSnominee @SCOTUSnom @pattyforiowa
@ChuckGrassley Constitution empowers President to appoint whether or not you abdicate your duty to advise and consent. Proceed, Senator.
@ChuckGrassley the constitution is the constitution irrespective of which party is in office.  #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley You used to be one of the moderates. Sad that you moved. But tell me why it's appropriate? #doyourjob
@ChuckGrassley if I was Mr Garland I would've gave this guy a knuckle sandwich.
@ChuckGrassley As a voter in Iowa, please #DoYourJob, or in November, we'll vote for someone who will.
@ChuckGrassley you're the laughingstock of the country. #DoYourJob or retire.
@ChuckGrassley scum. Way to circumvent the constitution for political nonsense. Ensuring I vote democratic in Nov even if Hillary wins
@ChuckGrassley you are waiving your right to advise and consent.
@ChuckGrassley Nice posturing.  You can't have your cake and eat it too.  You are being obstructionist.  That is all. #doyourjob
@ChuckGrassley Was there a polite way to say "you're qualified but we can't let Obama have anything because we're complete tools,"?
@ChuckGrassley The people *have* spoken, we elected Obama for 4 years. What will your excuse be when another dem wins the White House?
@ChuckGrassley #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley the people had a voice. That voice elected Barack Obama. HE did the job we elected him to do. How 'bout YOU do YOURS?!
@ChuckGrassley Senator you are a traitor to the constitution same as the rest of the GOP that will not give Judge Garland a vote #Pathetic
@ChuckGrassley Do the job we elected you to do.  I'm ashamed for our state. #DoYourJob
.@ChuckGrassley You explained that the GOP Senate is too busy throwing tantrums to #DoYourJob ?
.@ChuckGrassley doesn't speak for me Judge @GarlandMerrick. He won Iowa with 718K votes. Obama got 65 million votes.
@ChuckGrassley I choose to be a registered independent so I may consider all sides. You sir are not leaving me any choice for my vote
@ChuckGrassley You know this action is further endangering your party, right? Your obstruction based on personal bias is unbecoming.
@ChuckGrassley and why is that sir? What super valid, carved in stone, and legally pertinent reason did you give for obstruction?
Hi Judge Garland,
We aren't moving forward because we're sore losers who don't respect the People or Constitution. @ChuckGrassley #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley  You think the American people are chumps.
@ChuckGrassley #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley Meanwhile we will enjoy all the conservative side losses due to 4-4 ties when #scotus unable to reverse lower cts #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley Disgraceful! #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley do your GD job. Your racism and disrespect towards our President is just alarming. #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley Are you really that stupid? Or do you just think the American people are? #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley #DoYourJob  it's the least u can do ... Earn your pay!
.@ChuckGrassley w/ bogus rhetoric about Garland nom. The ppl elected @BarackObama and Congress in 2010, 12, and 14 #CommonSense #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley having breakfast with Judge Garland is a start. Now please #DoYourJob and Call the hearing that he and America deserve.
@ChuckGrassley #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley What a jerk! What are you afraid of? Do your constitutional job. Dereliction of duty
@ChuckGrassley You're right. The next president will decide. And Hillary will be picking someone more liberal than Garland.
.@ChuckGrassley Please indicate section of Constitution where it says Democratic Presidents have no right to fulfill duties, only GOP ones.
@ChuckGrassley: Good job. It's sad that so many are unconcerned with threats to our liberties. if we lose 2A, the rest fall like dominoes.
@ChuckGrassley you should be ashamed. We did use our voice in the last election. #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley Good plan, I bet Hillary will nominate a judge you will love!  #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley Get ready for Senator Patty Judge in November. She'll crush you in the election.
@ChuckGrassley Skip breakfast and #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley is the reason because you have a small wee-wee?
@ChuckGrassley #doyourjob or get voted out with the rest of your party come November
@ChuckGrassley People already had a voice &reelected President Obama.. his job was to nominate.. yours is to hold hearings with up/down vote
@ChuckGrassley that is not the way the system works Senator.. stop shirking your job!
@ChuckGrassley do your JOB!
@ChuckGrassley do your job!!!
@ChuckGrassley This is completely wrong and contrary to the Constitution. And an insult to a highly respected jurist
@ChuckGrassley Eats breakfast on tax payor $$$today . But does NO work the entire fiscal yearvand gets paid taxpayer $$$$$$$$$&$&$$$
@ChuckGrassley the people's voice was heard when they re-elected @POTUS #DoYourJob #advice&consent.It's in the Constitution. Art 2 section 2
@ChuckGrassley Do Your Job! Trife
@ChuckGrassley I hope the people's voice deprives you of your seat to punish your refusal to #ConfirmGarland.
@ChuckGrassley DO YOUR JOB
@ChuckGrassley How *does* one explain crass partisan hackery & blatant constitutional obstruction over a "pleasant breakfast"? Just curious.
@ChuckGrassley Because Obama. Period. #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley Who paid? #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley what did you have for breakfast, sour grapes? Your state voted for Pres Obama. Twice! #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley I'd like an explanation why he can't even be considered.  Want to vote him down?  Fine.
@ChuckGrassley #ChunkChuck. If you can't so the job you need to go.
@ChuckGrassley Stay firm.  We don't want unbalanced & slanted gov't. Obama has had 2 appointments & he should feel humble & not wanting MORE
@ChuckGrassley wish I lived in Iowa so I could vote against you. #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley - #DoYourJob you lazy old man. If you're taking the people's dollars you should do the people's work. #GOP #fail
@ChuckGrassley But the voters will be moving forward to vote you OUT
@ChuckGrassley Pleasant for who, you jackass?
@ChuckGrassley DO YOUR JOB OR RESIGN!  How can you cash a paycheck from the taxpayers and refuse to work? #WelfareQueen
@ChuckGrassley do your job or quit !!
@ChuckGrassley believe OUR president, Obama should put a time limit on your obstruction. If you don't, silence means consent, you passed.
@ChuckGrassley Can you perhaps explain it to your constituents? #doyourjob
@ChuckGrassley please do your job, Senator
@ChuckGrassley #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley Now that you favor it, but where was your support of Joe Biden's idea back in 1992?
@ChuckGrassley Why?  Because he's a democrat nominee.  Nothing more/nothing less.  A GOP pres and this this FLIES through.  Last year or not
.@ChuckGrassley  please either do your job ir forfeit your salary to someone who will.

Shame on you.
@ChuckGrassley Maybe you still want to see Obama's birth certificate? Your treatment of this president is outrageous. History will remember.
@ChuckGrassley it's an unfortunate you are being paid tax dollars to do nothing.
@ChuckGrassley You're a fraud. Obama's been elected TWICE by the people. Voters have spoken. Grow a spine and do your job pal.
@ChuckGrassley Does it take a full meal to say "I'm a petulant child"
@ChuckGrassley A sad commentary on your "leadership" of your state. Only eating breakfast but not doing your job is pitiful. Resign now.
@ChuckGrassley I'm embarrassed that you represent Iowa.
@ChuckGrassley Senator, #DoYourJob Please.
@ChuckGrassley There was a time when I held you up as the rational Republican office holder with whom I disagreed but would take a meeting.
@ChuckGrassley 4 thoughts #DoYourJob #termlimits, Classy Harkin retired on a high note, you won't; and it's going to be Garland either way!
@ChuckGrassley If the founders wanted directly elected Supreme Court they could have required that. Spoiler alert: they didn't.
@ChuckGrassley At 83 years old is it time to put old Chuck out to pasture? Vote and retweet
@ChuckGrassley Your explanation is not good enough! Do your job!
@ChuckGrassley  come on enough do what you were elected for. Have the hearing
@ChuckGrassley guarantee you won't like HRC's nominees any more than you like Obama's #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley how about explaining that to the rest of us #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley the law states the there should be nine Justices, why are you disregarding the law?
https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1 …
@ChuckGrassley Do your job.
@ChuckGrassley I guess you will let Hillary choose the next justice.
@ChuckGrassley Was the reason "we just straight up don't like Pres Obama?"  Because I'm not sure what else it would be.
@ChuckGrassley do your job. C'mon. You should be better than this.
@ChuckGrassley So you told him you don't want to #DoYourJob?
@ChuckGrassley The people have a voice, in the form of the democratically elected president. It's you who's disenfranchising the electorate.
@ChuckGrassley Do your job and vote and stop being a coward.
@ChuckGrassley Chairman Grassley, please hold the hearings and vote! GOP can be and was better than this embarrassing stunt.
@ChuckGrassley lol you know this shit has comments, right?
@ChuckGrassley by your logic 34 Senator's shouldn't vote on this nation either including you
. @ChuckGrassley Thanks for meeting with #SCOTUSnominee. Now #DoYourJob and hold a confirmation hearing.
@ChuckGrassley You mean, why you're putting partisan politics above the Constitution? #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley #doyourgoddamnjob
@ChuckGrassley I am a 69 year old, white, midwestern born gun owning American patriot and,Chuck,you are an embarrassment to our demographic
