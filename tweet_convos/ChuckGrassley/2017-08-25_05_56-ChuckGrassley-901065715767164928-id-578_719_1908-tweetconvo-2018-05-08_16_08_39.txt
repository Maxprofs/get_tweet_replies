Sen Grassley, George W Bush didnt make mistakes with Katrina, Gov Blanco did. Pls stop spreading Liberal propaganda. Trump is on top of it.
Thanks, I needed a good laugh!
I'm on it, friend! Already coordinating state and federal response teams.
Sigh. If only, Nice Donald Trump, if only...
That was an aide tweeting. There was no grandstanding. Might be in the next tweet.
Yeah, he forgot to mention that he won Texas by "eleventy billion" popular votes and that he "owes" Texas.  Had to be an aide.
Eleventy billion
Haw it's a parody account of a "what if there was a nice Trump?", it's a funny and sad thing all at once.
yes.
Yes it was pretty embarrassing when the Canadian rescue ships made it to Katrina first.
What? Fake NEWS! I was here in New Orleans and local boat owners, NOPD, NOFD, and Wildlife and Fisheries was first on scene. Stop lying
Google it. Even Faux News reported it. Bill O'Reilly accused the Canadian Ambassador of trying to purposely embarrass the US.
I lived it in New Orleans. Sorry BS. They probably helped but were not 1st on scene.

Tell me again who's a liar and fake news?! Americans don't have a clue what other nations do because your news is so self centered.
Read the article I sent genius. They landed in Lafayette on Aug 31 and arrived in NO on Sept 3. Rescues had been going on since Aug 30.
That Canadian search and rescue made it anywhere first should be a complete embarrassment. Your name calling & insults don't change that.
He sure did keep on top of it, signing for aid to help before everything hit , thanks Mr. President, we in Houston love you!!!
Utter Vermin who care more about their wealth creation vehicles than saving or supporting lives!
Common Myth. I hated Bush but the story that stated it took 3 weeks is a lie by the usual fake news pushers
#houstonflood
are you people completely incapable of compassion? These are real people in harms way. Fellow Americans.
.
Based on the rhetoric that comes out of Texas, surely Texas won't expect any help whatsover from the federal government.
I understand your tweet; pls remember TX officials past policies didn't reflect all Texans, same as Trump doesn't for all of our country.
Oh, I live in NC, so I certainly understand. But the point needs to be made as a reminder of how ridiculous the anti-fed govt folks are.
Oh, ferchrissake. Senile much? How was having crappy, incompetent governance in NOLA & LA Bush's fault?
Texas is on this.
Or what obama did with sandy
Bribery is commonplace in this administration...
How can he stay on top of situation without someone heading up FEMA? How is he going to achieve that?
that we Americans, supposedly independent wonder people, have to rely on some idiot in an office in D.C. is truly pathetic.
Pathetic tweet.
He already made the mistake. His tweets this morning were attack someone then praise himself as usual. Tired of this.
Chuckie, President Bush was faced with an incompetent mayo and a bunch of baffoon during Katrina who contributed to the storms wrath.
Oops two spelling errors.  So, report me to the spelling police.
From the top down...
Have him removed already. #TrumpRussia #ImpeachTrumpPence
Trump doesn't care about the #HurricaneHarvery victims. All he cares about is his stupid golf and Fox News. He's a cruel hearted SOB.
Republicans bring up Obama to try to defend Trump.  What are you going to do, Grassley, to help America through its ordeal with Trump?
Grow up Senator Grassley. Not necessary to air your memory of President Bush's response to Katrina.  Living in the past ...not cool
I made cuts at FEMA and still running it better than Obama! If hundreds or thousands die, it is HIS fault #ShariaLaw
President Trump, please do something about SOROS and these EVIL ASS PROTESTORS!
Trump did not repeat the same mistakes.  He invented new ones.
Corruption is rife with the GOP!!
And GOP should not make same mistake as reps voted after SANDY
Have you or Trump considered global warming?
Ahem.....he doesn't listen well.
The Obama crew knew what to do
He won't make the same mistakes as Bush, he will make worse ones. At least Bush didn't leave for vacation.
Yeah, pretend you have a golf course here. #HurricaneHarvey
He wasn't planning to golf in Texas so the hurricane won't be a problem for him.
He cannot stop his self adoration long enough to give a crap about this. All of u should freaking do something to remove the incompetent 45.
didnt Pres Bush offer assist before cane came, and dumbocRAT gov declined? dont think is correct at all to say Bush's mistake. Spine matters
Dude, Trump just pardoned a bigot, and signed a bill banning Transgenders from the military, all during #HurricanHarvey. GOP is repulsive.
I truly enjoyed that giant whopper you told your constituents about how much golf Trump played vs. Obama!
Let history remember you as compatriot and sympathizer with our racist, above-the-law dictator. We need braver men than you.
nice that you're trying to teach the toddler to behave, but #RacistPresident needed to pardon Arpaio first.
I detested Bush. I left when he was elected. Now that Trump is a so called POTUS I'm considering becoming a British citizen. #Impeach45
Well imagine that !!
Don't worry..My President KNOWS what he's doing!
What part of ALL HATE NEEDS 2STOP do u ppl not understand including u Grassley u ppl bad mouth POTUS ur no better u lost get over it
Dont u make same mistak mayor Nagin new Orleans &embezzle millions n federal funds what mistake did Bush make POTUS cant control everything
You people are so hateful and #UnAmerican!
Really Chuck? Iowans are looking for u to keep on top of Trump's racism, destruction of democracy, lying ...

"Good luck" here is a 
And where is his FEMA Director?  Oh yeah, there isn't one is there?
What's Trump going to do? He doesnt have a clue how to lead in this situation.
Mr. Grassley, IA's Grandpa, this is a reminder that UR a part of a corrupt clan responsible for keeping ths destructive menace in the WH. 
The gall you have to tweet this when POTUS is clearly involved! Where is his new FEMA Director or his other posts? #Useless
He's been on top of Hurricane. Communicating with @GovAbbott since midweek. Offering support Texans need
Don't listen to CNN or Jim Acosta.  President working with Gov Abbott of Texas
@ChuckGrassley oh another thing, NEVER compare our @POTUS to Bush, NEVER!
Hey @ChuckGrassley you don't even have to say anything, unlike the PAST presidents @POTUS loves and cares about the American people!
His tweet keyboard is ready, banality will follow, followed by finger pointing
So u have to tell the president how to act....thats scary....
Wow. Preemptively reminding people that another @GOP Prez failed to insulate the dear leader when he fails in his leadership. Slick.
He really took your advice. Not.

You must be joking. Trump makes Bush look smart
He is very busy creating havoc.....hope he has the energy to pay attention to important things like a hurricane.
Yeah don't do anything like pardon a Sheriff or denounce your transgender troops right before it hits while ppl like this support you!
Setting up the narrative eh?  You are a political hack.  #MAGA
"Don't forget to pardon a racist bigot like joe Arpaio
Don't worry @ChuckGrassley, @realDonaldTrump tweeted that he's watching "the doings" of the hurricane.  Hope you feel better knowing that.
Too late. No director at FEMA, no director at NOAA, no ERP. Soon: no Trump base in Texas.
First off Trump won't have an ignorant mayor and a cocky feminist governor that refuse help until it's too late .
Trump doesn't give a shit about this storm since he's not in the midst of it. He's lost total interest in presidency since he can't be king!
unfair that bush got blamed when the gov. didn't work with him
Do you realize it's really bad that a POTUS needs this advice? Like maybe REALLY GD BAD? #draftthearticleschuck
You mean Dem mayor & governor. Don't forget abysmal handling of Sandy by @BarackObama , largely ignored by media. You're just as bad!
you were quoted in an article by @washingtonpost
Naw, he decided to pardon the racist convict instead
Oops, he was too preoccupied w/ that pardon burning a hole in his pocket. He wanted to be Pontius Pilot in AZ, but had 2 settle for Harvey 
Please. Why adopt leftist propaganda version? Katrina was bad due to ZERO planning or competence of LA democrats in charge. Feds aren't 1st.
DUH and what exactly was either suppose to do, stand up and blow at the hurricane and blow it back to sea?
Oh he will. And he'll do worse.
Hey chuck! You really think trump is concerned.Then you have been trumped by the sociopath. Uses hurricane as smoke screen for horrific acts
Sen, he is pardoning a racist today. He was not focused
@JoeNBC @morningmika @amjoyshow @Lawrence Trump pardons a bigoted racist in AZ while TX citizens are facing disaster while Trump eats BORSCH
#dickmove Senator
Too late. #Arpaio
Hahaha hahaha, you have no head of NOAA, no head of FEMA, Hurricane now at Cat 4. Yeah.. Ok
You mean NOLA Mayor Nagin,he refused to evacuate the city for political reasons,and he's still in prison for corruption
I'd like to see his failed administration on top of the thing.  Or in front of it.  Or under it.  Let'er go.
Don't fret Chuck, Donny will drop the ball on this one. It's what he does best.
Stay focused---
RussiaRussiaRussiaRussiaRussiaRussiaRussiaRussiaRussiaRussiaRussiaRussiaRussiaRussiaRussiaRussiaRussiaRussiaRussiaRussia
Too late, he's gone golfing. It's after 5 on a Friday. #ImpeachTrump #TrumpResign #TrumpRussia #25thAmendmentNow
Good luck, Chuck.
Hey Up #Chuck: I Got Your Keep On Top; You 2 #TRump & #Bush Boy!

#BREAKING #America #USA #WorldNews #Atlanta #Macon #Texas #CorpusChristi
Trump is on top of nothing and you know it.  If Congress doesn't get this clown out, what happens to this country is on them.
Trump's too busy pardoning Arpaio. 
#ImpeachTrump
Sorry Chuck, but Donnie's busy pardoning an abusive, racist hater. No time for #Harvey. #Birdsofafeather
Instead of being concerned about the disaster unfolding in Texas, Trump just issued his pardon of #SheriffJoeArpaio #GOPFail #ImpeachTrump
What's the over/under on Trump actually heeding this advice?
#TheLastAmericanDream is now a Russian #KKK #transmilitaryban #HurricanHarvey Nightmare with #NazisInTheWhiteHouse
Category 4 hurricane is hitting Texas and he is off again and pardoned a bigot before he left #ImpeachTrump
It's almost endearing you think he can even do anything at this point
He wished them good luck what else do expet from him it's not like he's a real leader or even a real decent human being. #Resist
If he doesn't it will be the first mistake he hadn't made!!
He is too busy pardoning racists and kicking patriots out of the armed forces.  #ImpeachTrump #donthecon #HurricaneHarvey #goodlucktexas
Yea while he is on vacation!!! #hurricaneharvey2017
Oh, DJT won't make the same mistake.
He will make the most tremendous disaster out of this actual disaster, like the world has never seen.
@PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump So immigrants working hard in Texas might be in harms way IMPOTUS would not be concerned
Well shit he said good luck everybody and threw a thumbs up what the hell do u expect from a lazy sob
Thinking that YOU were a party to that "mistake" that Bush made with Katrina. Probably should do YOUR job!
Wow chuck
Only golf courses will be helped...
@realDonaldTrump LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR
Trump has zero leadership qualities - the victims of hurricane Harvey better not get their hopes up
LOL haven't you realized that unless he can profit off something he doesn't GAF?!?
You’re doing a heck of a job Brownie!!!
pretty sure he will say it's #fakenews and blame @CNN
We have no director of #NOAA b/c Trump didn't nominate anyone to fill the position.  Smaller #govt has consequences. #HurricaneHarvey2017
No red state bailouts! You want freedom? Pay for the repairs yourself!
hahaha, yes, I'm sure he's paying close attention, listening closely to advisors who actually know things, and thinking REALLY HARD about it
Republicans will probably call Trump    presidential if the WH does NOT botch its response to Harvey. Such a low benchmark.
Support @Potus  DO the work of the People  ...Repeal & Replace ...BUILD THE WALL!
Gonna release some info next week? #TrumpDossier
You Senators make Me laugh, @POTUS is doing his Job Why dont YOU WORRY ABOUT DOING YOUR JOB; Healthcare, Tax Reform, Debt Ceiling etc.etc 
.@ChuckGrassley Huh? Did you forget senate confirmed the best: @Fema_Brock 95-4 I think #texas in good hands #harvey
You Cowards don't Stand Together with President Trump and Country now your telling the President what to do, Republican leaders are Cowards
Really? Gov Blanco was a bigger issue for us and right behind her incompetence was Mayor Nagin. Try to keep up Chuck
Was that really necessary?  If you wanted to tell @realDonaldTrump something like this, why not PM him?  #NotCool
By supporting that traitor, you too are complicit.
Chuck,please don't become a Trump wannabe by blaming other presidents. It is so unbecoming!!
Isn't it sad you had to say something?
Isn't everything that happens someone's fault except his? Even natural disasters?
He'll do it from the golf course. Actually, if he passes this test, I won't think so poorly of him.
Well Chuck don't worry DJT can do it all better than anyone else. surprised he isn't telling the hurricane to leave our country in a rweet
Bush made? I seem to recall NONE of the local plans were enacted by local "leadership".
FEMA and the national hurricane center are probably understaffed. At least the Republican President will stay abreast of the news on CNN.
Bush made a mistake because he's clueless. Trump is a narcissistic dolt.
I'm sure this helped 

release the transcripts
Good luck with that. Unless some of his klansmen call him up. Or he tweets about some irrelevant polls about it and him.


, find #RussiaHoax perpetrators and #Leakers -- #MSM going to lie about @POTUS anyway
In other words Donald, just study what President Obama did with super storm Sandy! #TrumpFailure
Trump got ur message & may visit Texas! Also Remind him, Mexico was supposed to pay for Border Wall &to denounce Domestic Terrorism/Violence
He's off to Cape David but he did wish all those in harms way "good luck". 
Oops too late Chuck....Trump left for the weekend!  He thinks his work week is Mon thru Fri@and he can watch tv & tweet all day long!!
Oh my. IJN.
Hes off afgain the weekend   probably golfing  or watching fox fake news   we have a crisis and hes away from the office AGAIN
Time to retire Chuck. 
Time to limit Senators to two terms going forward.
It's so cute that you think Trump has any idea what he's doing.
@potus he doesnt believe in the hurricane because it's on the 'fake news'!!
People are about to lose everything they own and this genius stands smiling on tv making some insane political comment? God Help OUR Pres.
I survived Katrina. The problems with Katrina were not Pres Bush. It was a total failure of the Army Core of engineers 1 of 2
And a incompetency of the New Orleans city government and the emotional breakdown of Governor Blanco 2 of 2
I'm waiting for CNN to blam this on you lol.
Hey! He makes his own fuckin' mistakes. The best mistakes.
And I thought the blame was on the local government not being prepared
Couldn't you call him? I mean, seriously?
#HurricaneHarvey... Your idiot, #ManBaby Pres:  "Watch this drive!"
We see how you Koch-GOPs act...we know why...ALEC $$...keep cutting...you'll get cut..next..!
All of a sudden trusting science.? Gonna cut more from NOAA..how about the satelites that photo these things..? Cutting them too..? Assholes
Good luck with that, Senator
Too late Chuck!
To stage is set for his epic failure!
Chuck, the Bush Bashers have a new whipping boy now. Clouds during the eclipse? Trump's fault. Hurricane? Sun spots? Gas prices?
Are You kidding me ?? What about Obama????
Is this something you should have to say?  That "says" it all.  Worry about your own state.
This is the first crisis that hasn't been self-inflicted.
If you say this it is already to late. We know he doesnt give a rats ass.
#FireGorka #FireMiller
If they don't like comparisons to Nazis they should stop talking like them and stop supporting them. Never again.
somehow I don't believe he will listen or step up to the plate. Sad!

Sorry to bother you with this photos fot a children killed in #Raqqa by the #INTcollation and #SDF artillery
SDF #ISIS #sameshit
@Raqqa_SL 
@ananavarro   The man's an idiot...he cant hold a thought or an opinion one day to the next. Unless he has property there he wont care.

Campaign to get @billbrowder 1M followers. Piss off Putin. Spread his word. Honor Magnitsky. Great book "Red Notice."
Putin likes Nazis. Do you like Mr. Gorka, Sen. Grassley? #fireGorka
Christoph Hörstel, the leader of the German anti-Semitic party "Deutsche Mitte", visited Russia-annexed Crimea and met with Putin. 

Trump Adviser Gorka wearing nazi ally uniform-the nazi group says he swore lifetime oath-so a nazi's LITERALLY in the WH!
