Don't start acting like the other 'Chuckie'. You know, the other one seeking attention (hint: from NY). Help MAGA!
@NormEisen Put down pitchforks for a second. This is a great development. Give him credit for speaking up.
bahahahaha.
you were paid by Betsy Devos to put her in office and now our children will pay the price
Yes, they will pay the price of getting a real education with homework and projects and parent involvement. #RUREADY
I think he understands just fine.
.@ChuckGrassley Glad to see you join the #TrumpImpeachmentParty and demanding an independent investigation - The people of IA applaud you
If you are going to press true accountability on the White House, this Iowan will have your back. Qapla!

@NormEisen This seems a bizarre strategy by Sen Grassley.  He has been doing this for several days. I don't get it
@Kris_Sacrebleu POTUS understands transparency =accountability. That is why he isn't transparent. Duh.
Senator Assley how about you find out why GOP dnt seem to be in a hurry to do their job . President has done more than GOP .
@cscstars you act as if you are someone important. #DoYouJob!!!!
SOOO you'll be countering Trump's efforts to remove transparency requirements from the oil industry, right??
#distraughtIowan
@StephenBannon
please keep this up; we need some accountability.
Accountability means vetting the president's nominee for Court:  Garland Merrick.
Maybe include him in your tweet so he would see this @realDonaldTrump @POTUS 
Washington protects him from anything negative
ChuckGrassley you need to.go home for sure.   Too old to be doing this stop now and go home.
you can't possibly think Trump's twitter is monitored lol
It would start with releasing Trump's tax return
If only you cared as much about your constituents' concerns regarding this administration's actions and ties. #DoYourJob
Pls if you think this.
What is your true aim?????????
More importantly: will @HouseGOP @SenateGOP wake up and expel Nazis from the White House before it's too late? #Bannon #Gorka
Obama's administration was not transparent Trump's is.  The #Democratic party has failed #Americans
This seems positive. Better than the other options being bandied about. @POTUS
thank you
might help.if you send msgs to @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
Good for you! Now please get @jasoninthehouse to INVESTIGATE! @RepCummings @amjoyshow @PeteDominick @JohnWDean @BruceBartlett
hmmm,says a man who is one of the leaders of the GOP cult!
Bannon to CEG: "We think of ourselves as virulently anti-establishment, particularly 'anti-' the permanent political class."
How about just setting up a meeting with the president - like a grown up congressman, rather than middle-school twittering?
respectfully disagree. Transparency is a necessary but not sufficient condition for accountability.
Dt don't care about that! He thinks he above all branches of gov. No accountability for senate or judges he thinks he's king.
POTUS needs your support not MORE HYSTERICS.  Call him! Call Dan Scavino!  YOU R A UNITED STATES SENATOR - USE YOUR POSITION!
- nice try Chuckles but you've already shown your true colors. You're bought and paid for. Coward!
transparency? Like having your office release the number of calls you received for vs against Betsy DeVos?
accountability? Like holding a public town hall in Polk county at night or on a weekend?
.@ChuckGrassley Whoever monitors Twitter for Sen Grassley get on subject of listening to all constituents in Iowa. Tell him open 99 mtgs.
dude your so phony bruh, it's easy to point one guy out everyone gang up and bully him and his family keep up work u got 8yrs
Clinton emails???
have you lost your mind?! Trump is most transparent Pres in history!He's doing what he promised more than I can say for you!
speaking of accountability, the people of Iowa will hold you accountable for tying up the Supreme Court seat for 1 year
@jaketapper You can't get him on the phone? You could be like Bill in Nightshift..the"idea man"
Would it not be better if you actually tweeted to @WhiteHouse ?
@jaketapper Voted Yes for all cabinet Noms. Not draining the swamp or interested in transparency. Time to say bye, Chuck.
What?  The Great Charles Grassley finally speaking out against his, "boy," President?  About time; and, good for Grassley.
who is monitoring your twitter so that you know that Iowans do not want a wall. We want clean air and water, parks, schools.
Grassley = political hack!
where is your accountability for giving Garland a SCOTUS hearing?
whoever monitors twitter at Wendy's, can I get some free food please ?!
I'm not falling for your fake outrage. You've voted for all his noms 100% of time with no vetting.
Chuck,  quit pretending to care. If you really wanted to get his attention you would have added:  @realDonaldTrump
does this mean you will push for Trump to release his taxes?
party actually believed him.
that's what happens when you elect a businessman who claims he "ALONE" can solve the country's problem.And idiots in your
Your town halls are going to be stressful.
@jaketapper as an Iowan I'm shamed that you find Trumps cabinet of Robber Barons acceptable! Things are gonna go to Hell!
Transparency = HOW MUCH $$$ YOU TOOK FROM DEVOS.
@jaketapper Was this account hacked?
please keep demanding transparency from @realDonaldTrump
but you need to send this to him so they'll read it...I'll do it -->

@realDonaldTrump and @POTUS
can you provide transparency about devos decision? Why? Besides simply saying it won't be damaging because it is up to states
I've asked him the same question. Left messages, sent e-mails. 3 kids in a great public school, I'm terrified.
@jaketapper Hence why folks are concerned about rampant sex crimes in The District. Meta accountability arguably comes 1st.:)
At very least an explanation by @johnpodesta concerning content of his 'Pizza' related emails. What's the deal?:)
Right minded Fathers in monogamous marriages are frightened by the lack of concern yall are exuding.
If I had emails w'aforementioned content I'd be investigated & subsequently face an indictment. Why?
@jaketapper THANK YOU Mr. Grassley. Maybe P. Trump will listen.  ðŸ–’  EJ
You give Iowa a bad name step down and delete your account. #BoycottCNN
@jaketapper Finally figured out when the White House is lying. It's when their lips move!
You're a senior senator; you have to resort to tweet-begging someone else to talk to @potus of your own party??
@jaketapper Careful - this sounds somewhat principled. Now stop rubber-stamping the least qualified nominees in history.
Oh look journalists! President goes to Mar a Lago for "golf" and Dimitry Rybolovev's MKATE flies to West Palm Beach! Look
@jaketapper The Chuck Grassley; not the Chuck Grassley; go sling get along Chuck ?
Can't wait to return "home" to Iowa & resume voting against you at every opportunity.  Please don't retire until then.
,  nice.
Have you not seen his tweets??? YOU REALLY THINK SOMEONE MONITORS THAT MESS????
Trump told staff to use outside emails & phone for communicating with each other. He doesn't care about security
DT not able or willing 2 understand. All abt propaganda, gaslighting, fear. Nothing but lies. GOP is colluding.
go on @FoxNews and say this. DJT will hear you there!! Go get 'em Chuck!
#DoYourJob
Senator, your party has placed a disturbed con man in the White House.  It needs to address that problem.
@jaketapper Mr. Grassley, would be great and earn respect if you stand up to this prez more. Country/Iowa over party, please!
What's the over/under on how long it takes before he realizes he's been hacked? I'm taking the over.
@jaketapper Sen you should read your tweets to. Investigate DT Russian ties and vote fraud. Stop lying for DT
.@ChuckGrassley @jaketapper assume accountability dead
@jaketapper Yes, his business dealings need 2 be as transparent as he is! This Admin is the epitome of garbage in garbage out
@jaketapper Trying to get out in front of your next encounter w/constituents Senator? Won't work!
they are not going to cut you in on their deal.  And if they told you (the details of the deal), as the saying goes...
@jaketapper never did for Obama...you did nothing!
@jaketapper QUIT tweeting and hold this "businessman" accountable. He is ruining your party and my country. Tic tic tic tic
@jaketapper   So what has gotten into Chuck?  There must be more to this story.  But you go, Chuck!
Not sure who is writing these tweets but they're unintelligible.
Do your job and check Nazi coup! Collaborators will be punished!
Sir...your Iowa constituents DEMAND that you push aggressively to get answers about @realDonaldTrump and Russia. DO IT!!!
Ill help. DNC server was not hack was a leak. They didnt even have security on it. Highschooler could of hacked
More worried abt that than knowing what was in emails, huh? We know that's why H started the Russian scare
pipeline that H's pal wanted through Syria. Assad said no. We pushed forward & BO & H aided by arming rebels
Assad asked Putin to help; Russia blocks the pipeline. Hillary blames Russian whilst giving our Nuclear
Time in the same Debate.She also said she would use military force for cyber ie WW3 On top of that Soros
Actions speak louder than words, Chuck.
Why did you vote for Devos? $$$$$
PPS - remember that you CHOSE to tie yourself to his legacy. His chaos is yours.
PS - at least tag @POTUS @VP @WhiteHouse
Wait - are you unable to get in contact with @POTUS any way but tweet??  Frustrating, ain't it? 
Chuck why not give someone a private phone call?
your constituents are monitoring you De Vos$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
If you don't take action with @POTUS we'll know u r pretending to care so u can say at town halls that its been addressed.
bruh. You didn't even @ them. @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump
Thank you for finally speaking out. Please follow with action not just words so we know you're serious,
Just stop; stop pretending you're "independent".  Your votes fall in line with trump; anything #trump does u support.
don't you have some sort of ability to access the POTUS besides via Twitter? Try calling Putin, he may have his direct line.
You're brainwashed by media. 
clearly you missed the sarcasm
I hate when that happens. My bad.
Chuck is gonna be pissed when he sees what you did with his twitter, kid.
yeah, I hope the intern that did this is going to be  okay
When will you start understanding he is only looking out for @realDonaldTrump
Sen =  Pro Tip â€“ WE watch what you do, NOT what you say !
also it may help if you @ the president's Twitter with @POTUS. Just saying
has your account been hacked or are you finally going to investigate Trump #confused
I'm guessing acct hacked
Chuck, c'mon, @POTUS is far too busy making America great with his wall and travel ban fake terrorist attacks to notice you.
yeah!
Does this mean you're supporting investigation into conflicts of interest & foreign interference?
It may be extortion to continue the farmer welfare queen program; or, the windmill tax credits to Warren Buffett
Accountability= listening to your constituents and not hiding behind voice mail.
and not turning off the phones!
partial transparency = 
zero accountability

Trump is the most opaque faker in the history of politics.
