@OliviaKelly_ Yeah. My boys didn’t understand why it bothered me.
@brianlynn :( I'm sure.
@OliviaKelly_ How’re you doing these days? I’ve been so busy I’ve been out of touch with my tweeps.
@brianlynn Okay. Not as much pain, tho no resolution yet on WHY. Meh.

@SonarJose @ChuckGrassley well said? How fucking high are both of you?
@indented @ChuckGrassley please refrain from your vulgarian language with the Senator of the United states. I think he knows how to "speak".
@ChuckGrassley Look up @alonzolerone on Youtube, Senator.
@ChuckGrassley this is why good grammar is so important.
@ChuckGrassley Your fear-mongering jingoistic rhetoric is disgusting. You, sir, are a disgrace to the people of Iowa.
@ChuckGrassley Wow. Bad grammar combined with bad politics and fear mongering of the worst ilk. Starting a presidential run, Senator?
@ChuckGrassley @morninggloria so...you're still mad at the Japanese?
@ChuckGrassley 14 years ago jihadists killed 3,000 of us. 9/11"lives in infamy" just as 12/7/41. Japan is a friend; will jihadists ever be?
@ChuckGrassley are you drunk?

@ChuckGrassley @Lowenaffchen and thank god, Senator, that we spent the following decades in an interminable war with the Japanese
@ChuckGrassley But if the jihadists are friendly, why do they want to kill us? WHY, CHUCK?!
@ChuckGrassley what are you even talking about?
@ChuckGrassley 
I think what he's saying is if we Nuke Jihadists like we dropped the bomb on the Japanese they will b our friends?  Insane!
@ChuckGrassley you sir are not making sense
@ChuckGrassley so are you saying we should drop two atomic bombs on the terrorists' country?
@ChuckGrassley You okay, Chuck? You sound like you're having a stroke, man.
@ChuckGrassley Are you having a fever dream?
@ChuckGrassley don't try blaming an intern or staffer for this example of bad grammar, even by Twitter standards.
@ChuckGrassley Well on the bright side, I'm glad the Jihadists are at least "Japanese friendly" or are Jihadists friendly, Japanese folks?
@ChuckGrassley
@ChuckGrassley @BaseballPundit Goodness gracious do I love when politicians use social media.
@YinZSTORE @ChuckGrassley No way Chuck tweeted this himself because it failed to blame Obama. Amateur hour. #firetheintern
@ChuckGrassley that's actually one of the dumbest things I have ever read in my life quit your job

@ChuckGrassley seriously hire a proof reader or something
@ChuckGrassley wow ... #idiot
@ChuckGrassley Little early to be hitting the hard stuff. Glue is bad, don't sniff glue.
@ChuckGrassley LMAO!
USA - the land where you can become senator with no brain, intellect or common sense. No wonder you make no sense.
@ChuckGrassley how to be incomprehensible, ignorant, racist and possibly slightly crazy in 140 characters or less. Bravo. #facepalm
@ChuckGrassley I thought I was up on current events but this has me confused.  Can you please draw a diagram?
@ChuckGrassley but why do the Japanese jihadists want to kill us?? They're so friendly!! 
@ChuckGrassley Wow, your a person who persuades people to vote for you with nonsense like this rhetoric.

Looks like @ChuckGrassley is having a stroke.
@ChuckGrassley I think he means the Jihadist like sushi or Sudoku. Al-Baghdadi loves Sudoku.
@ChuckGrassley can I ask you to propose a law to the Senate stating that none of you should have a twitter?
@ChuckGrassley eloquent
@ChuckGrassley Do we have to pay you for the use of "Japanese-Friendly Jihadist" in any future character we may or may not create?

@ChuckGrassley huh? Maybe read before you hit Tweet
@ChuckGrassley Someone got a cheat to crack this?
@ChuckGrassley Is this a parody account or should Grassley's children be stepping in to remove him from the public. #RockingChair #Porch
@ChuckGrassley - I assume this is the inscription on the plaque at the "Chuck Grassley Whites Only Library," right? @LOLGOP @TeaPartyCat
