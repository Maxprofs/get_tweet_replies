195 countries in the world, and Mexico has a monopoly on US Ag?
Mexico is one of the world top consumers of corn with since all of their food are based on it
And then again, maybe they are re-selling the corn for a higher price.  Who knows?  I'm not watching them, RU?
Farms take take take! Pathetic
maybe we shouldn't build a STUPID WALL we can't afford!
Still think we should build the wall?
your eyes & ears should always be wide open. Listen to your constituents. Disgusted with all republicans
Mexican products would be met with a response in kind, jeopardizing U.S. exports to Mexico.
TM @EPN @ChuckGrassley @LideresMexicano senator intro bill US Ag Must enter Mexico negotiations w eyes WIDE OPEN Consequences hurt farmers
Only by experiencing the pain & shame you & #45 inflict on others will you learn the lesson. Hitting you in the bank account
your party's big talk has consequences, nobody wins in a trade war, and farmers will be the first to get 
shot.#TrumpsAJoke
All cause your Pres tRump has Mexico scared & lots of us as well. Threats of walls & taxes equals strain.
backing Trump's immigration plan will hurt US Ag more! #unfit
- what did you expect when you elected a bad businessman with no political experience? You're eyes have been closed for yrs!
Okay. You need to have a mini-mental completed. I think you are senile. Didn't this occur to you before???? #alzheimersunit
Renegotiating trade would threaten six million U.S. jobs, mainly in states that voted for Trump.
Seriously, what did u expect? 45 is doing same thing to them. #tradewars #wall #WakeUpIowa #TermLimits #BringBackDems
that's what happens when you treat an entire country like garbage!! Good for  for standing up for themselves!
With 120 million consumers, Mexico is a key consumer market for U.S. companies, particularly agricultural producers.
TM @EPN @ChuckGrassley Senador Mexicano paso ley que danara Agri de EUA. Se debe entrar las negoc.con ojos abiertos, consecuencias a Agric
This is a direct result of the wall and the proposed 20% tariff on Mexican goods and produce. Talk to your GOP cronies.
maybe worry about what your own senate is doing. Like moving stolen justice appointments forward.  Thief in chief.
who's gonna pay for the f* wall now?
You really don't get it.
<<== HE did this!
what did you expect? Farmers who voted Trump will suffer.  Irony.
Retaliation for Trump's intention of building a fence. Trump's Tariffs will also hurt Agriculture.
finally figured that out?  Better late than never!  9B in food trade alone w/ Mexico. Wall sure is lookin pretty stupid!
it's called diplomacy. The GOP could use a refresher course.
maybe you should have a chat w/ @realDonaldTrump about this? There will be consequences 4 wall/trade talk by 45.
We told you so. What did you think @realDonaldTrump wall and trade tariffs were going to do? Please please #impeach45 soon.
How about put pressure on Brown (GovCA). To provide water conservation to help Central Valley
Elections have consequences.
If you were doing your job things like this wouldn't happen. Your legacy will be the destruction Trump causes the next 4 yrs
because of Trump! Senator when is your town meeting in Burlington,Iowa? We need to talk!
Open your eyes and investigate FBI impropriety, Russian involvement, and conflicts of interest.  Iowans do not want a wall!
you support trump and this is what happens. Shame on you.
oh so NOW you're not so sure about the wall. Of course.
forget the farmers. I'm from IA too and it's just another form of welfare. Compete in the open market,get a job w/o subsidies
Your ability to ignore your constituents and hide behind these tweets like you care is truly astounding.
@JACM0313 This was started by our #SOCALLEDPRESIDENT by THREATENING to drop out of NAFTA and building the wall, etc.
according to Farm Bureau back in the day NAFTA was going to be disastrous for us but nobody listens to "farmers"
Would it hurt to use some punctuation?
with @realDonaldTrump stance, why should Mexico go to bat for us in any economic sense? They need cash for $20BB wall right?
- the @GOP controls congress & WH, so you should have no problem legislating laws that are in Iowans interest, right?
nobody cares about ur farmer friends!! We care about the Traitor in office that u refuse to do anything about!
I love Iowa! - Votes against farmers, education, equality...hmmm....
If only there were someway we could have prevented this. Elections have consequences.
Um, this is your party's fault, not Mexico. That bed you made is full of nails, starting to get nervous?
remember senator. You supported POTUS any repercussions for his actions are partly in your lap
you are surprised that another country reacts like this after being treated with disrespect and threatened with tariffs?
The state is trying to take out 180k public employees. Good to know you are worried about SOMEONE in Iowa. #saveiaworkers
he is a disgrace to the state!
Where are you on Russia, sir?
then you need to oppose Trump's wall, the ban and the majority of his policies.
according to the Farm Bureau that is only 5% of the Iowa population. Concentrate on the 95% would you senator

Your support of a WH that has a deportation force is already hurting American farmers
This is important, but don't let it distract you from the real story today #investigateflynn #investigateTrump
"senator" @ChuckGrassley trump promised a trade war. You promised to help.  Will this hurt Grassley Farms' Federal Money? #MAGA
Mexican senator?
I assume in the Mexican legislature? Hard to tell with Grassley.
What did you expect when you backed a candidate that threatened a trade war? Can't wait to flip Iowa back to Dems.
What of the Flynn resignation? We need to hear from you on this.
Why don't we just drop a nuclear bomb on them and get it over with already ? ...    
I will miss the avocados .. but oh well ..
Flynn is why you take the time to actually vet nominees. You& rest of Senate are complicit in this for failure to do your job
Is anyone surprised about this? Treat our neighbors with disrespect, why wouldn't they decide to trade with someone else?
glad to see you are ignoring elephant in room. Shameful! #flynnresigns
Just another traitor that doesn't give a F about the country, just power.  In bed w Russians, Reagan would vomit.
maybe the farmers should plant less corn, how about a shift to switch grass ethanol, much more efficient, more eco-friendly
blasphemy!! Although it would be cool to have edible corn.
Also - stop protecting and supporting a POTUS that picks fights with our neighbors and is itching for a global trade war!!!
Do your job, Impeach Trump!!
