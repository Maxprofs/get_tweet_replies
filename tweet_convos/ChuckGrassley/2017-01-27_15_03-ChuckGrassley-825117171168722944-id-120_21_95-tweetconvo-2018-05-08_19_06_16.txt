if you want to honor the memories, then take a stance against #MuslimBan and prevent something similar from happening again.
And yet u can't see the poss of history repeating itself as we punish an entire religion for the actions of a tiny fraction?
Pay attention to the lives lost in the Holocaust remember and Trump is headed that way
@GrassleyPress Hey, is Grassley going to make any statements or does he not care about what's happening? Not a great look.
.@ChuckGrassley How about honoring the real, living breathing Muslims and immigrants who are being barred access to the USA? #NoBanNoWall
@GrassleyPress The millions of Jews, Senator.
If you're serious about this, where is your condemnation of Trump's actions?
can you please reconcile this tweet with the current ban on Syrian refugees?
Seriously? You tweet #NeverForget & then tweet abt sports while the US is turning away refugees fleeing violence? You should be ashamed
@GrassleyPress Where you at, Chuck? Lost ur voice?
Seems like you've already forgotThe silence from our Iowa senators is shameful.
putting Bannon in a right wing nationalist but job does not make this Jew feel good! No mention of Jews in speech. Get a grip
then why didn't you opposed the Muslim ban?
unless they are refugees from the Middle East in 2017??
@potus silence means you are complicit
Don't forget about the evil you're supporting when you support and align yourself with Trump & his administration. nvr4get
you mean the evil that sought to vilify immigrants, minorities, homosexuality, and other vulnerable populations?  That evil?
@GrassleyPress "never forget" means never letting it happen again. WHERE DO YOU STAND ON THE #MuslimBan ?!! Be an American.
You need to take a stand against the Muslim ban. You need to stand up for our country over party.
you are the evil. Are you fighting inside your brain? #RESIST
I assume you do not support Trump's use of an executive order to impose an immigration ban?  As you said in 2014?
Please listen to your constituents and represent us, as you were elected to do!
If you do not stand up against the Muslim ban and oppose Jeff Sessions then you have already forgotten!
Say No. to Sessions. The Ban. All cabinet Trump choices. stand up vote NO !!!!!!!Country before Party!@SenJohnMcCain
Too bad Trump doesn't feel that way. He admitted to deliberately leaving Jewish people in his statement.
I agree #neverforget Please represent Iowans and speak out against @POTUS executive order barring refugees.
Wasn't Anne Frank a refugee that America refused to take in? Your words ring especially hollow today #youforgotalready
@GrassleyPress never forget but stay silent on #MuslimBan? Speak up against xenophobia & racism!! #NoBanNoWall
Walk the Walk. #Resist the racism in the #muslimban.
"The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference." 
-Elie Wiesel, holocaust survivor. Silence is endorsement. #NeverAgain
really?????  This tweet on the same day as the muslim ban? #dobetter #bebetter
How about we show honor by standing about against The Executive Actions on Muslim countries and The wall #NoBanNoWall
if you truly want to honor those millions, what are YOU doing to keep @realDonaldTrump & his puppet master Brannon in check?
@GrassleyPress WHAT ABOUT #MuslimBan?This office will be closed 2018. ADDED TO NO-VOTE 2018 LIST. #MuslimBan #StopGOP
@realDonaldTrump seems to be forgetting who, in fact, were overwhelmingly victimized during the Holocaust. Thoughts?
oppose the immigration ban, Your silence about this shows your support. Stand up do the right thing, we are counting on you!
.@ChuckGrassley As an Iowa voter I expect you to express opposition to the ban of refugees. To not do so makes this statement hypocritical.
you must have forgotten already. Take another look at your admin. Gas lighting, demonizing specific races & religions. Fix it
Iowa is community of immigrants and refugees. What are you doing to protect our most vulnerable neighbors in light of Trumps's Muslim ban?
@GrassleyPress You seem to have forgotten #NeverForget. Otherwise you would speak out against the refugee ban. #hypocrisy
No mention of Jews.  Little memory issues creeping up?
@GrassleyPress and you honor holocaust remembrance day be staying silent about Muslim ban?
So, you will be opposing @POTUS on the Muslim ban? It seems to be in line with NEVER FORGET lives lost to evil
tweeting abt sporting events while refugees & legal residents banned from US? Are you forgetting? Or ignoring?
@GrassleyPress And maybe not enact bigoted policies that fly in the face of our stated values.
Let's not forget what @POTUS did today.  what are you going to do to preserve American values, Chucky?
This just happened in America by America with #MuslimBan
@GrassleyPress *say Jewish
You have already forgotten if you do not speak out against Trump's EO on immigration/refugees
It looks like you've forgot one day later...Where's your outrage on the #muslimban?
is that why we currently aren't letting refugees into the country?
@GrassleyPress Your hypocrisy is yet another reason why you're the poster boy for term limits.
@GrassleyPress Your hypocrisy is horrible and won't be forgotten.
DO YOU NOT SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW!!!
Yet you have no problem with a discriminatory ban of human beings? Do the right thing for once. #NoBanNoWall
please oppose the Muslim ban...this is getting scary
your silence on the #muslimban is appalling. Have you lost your Midwestern values?
He has no values. He is scum and his goal is to destroy American values. Resign.
My senator @ChuckGrassley WAS part of the GOP plan to not mention Jews on Holocaust Remembrance Day after all! Was yours?
by not mentioning Jews??? Good job.
@GrassleyPress learning from history is more important than just remembering. Listen to the people. #NoBanNoWall #MuslimBan
.@ChuckGrassley OPPOSE THE IMMIGRANT BAN. This is insanity.
NO not evil. U really don't know shit about this. It's fascism- people just like us who did nothing until it was 2 late.
then what are you gonna do about Trump's Muslim ban? also answer your phone.
@GrassleyPress Honor them by standing up against the immigrant ban from @POTUS
Hard to forget when you're working so hard on a repeat. As an IA voter, I find your silence on the muslim ban appalling.
@GrassleyPress Please tell us your position on the president's EO.  Can we assume you oppose given this statement?
@GrassleyPress 
Thank you for not forgetting-but mass genocide is happening every day in our world. Protect refugees.
Meanwhile, we repeat the processes of Nazi Germany. #dumptrump Return us to a compassionate country w freedom of speech.
please honor their memories by learning a lesson from history!  Support refugees, regardless of their religion!!
@GrassleyPress so what are you doing about the evil coming down in exec order?
How does white supremecist and nazi apologist @SteveKingIA feel about you saying this Chuck?
....plus the GOP has it's own new policy of hatred to enact am I right Chuck?
While you continue to support a president that is more similar to Hitler than any president in history.
1 day your great-grandchildren will learn of the Holocaust. Then u becoming a senator. Turns page- Syria & u didn't help them
say no to bans.
you mean to include the millions that will die as a result of repealing ACA. 
#resist #theresistance #unpresidented
@IsraelNewsNow Unless you oppose #Trump you are just another hypocrite. #RefugeeBan
You forgot already.
if you REALLY mean this, how can you support Trumps ban? "SEND ME YOUR POOR, HUDDLED MASSES..."
You fell asleep in front of president evil.
Good sound bite. "Make _____ Great Again" Hitlers exact words. 2 men with same intentions. Do SOMETHING!
PGOTUS timely exec order defining elements of new dictatorship, targeting innocent refugees fleeing for their lives.
Please do not support the ban on Muslims. We can not repeat history. This a stain on our country
Remember the SS St. Louis? It was a ship full of refugee Jews the US sent back to Germany in 1939. Learn from history, Chuck
Our new pres is doing the same thing in our nation.
you should honor the memories of those who were murdered by the Nazis by NOT SUPPORTING & LETTING IT HAPPEN AGAIN WITH TRUMP.
cmon. Tone deaf indeed
You had still had 16 characters left. There was no need to shorten any of this.
perhaps you could remind #FearlessLeader that he has made US the "Center Of the Universe" not in a good way. #neverforget
Follow @Stl_Manifest
So you are going to speak out against banning refugees? REFUGEES! We turned away Jews at our shores & they were murdered.
What kind of lives were they? Potus wouldn't say it.
And then support the refugee ban signed the same day?  Really?
Man, if only there was a system where our country could allow persecuted individuals to enter & live lives of freedom oh well
unbelievable tone deaf. @POTUS signs exec order banning Syrians on Holocaust Remembrance Day.
LMAOOOOO. Look at what your president has done today!
If you support the order @POTUS signed today barring refugees, then you've already forgotten.
https://twitter.com/Ali_H_Soufan/status/825105876767891456 … And to honor  those who died because of a lack of compassion, we will show a lack of  compassion.
We already vet people! This does'nt have any practical counterterrorism purpose. Will likely strain ongoing effective local CT partnerships. https://twitter.com/bbcworld/status/825100186930335745 …
So you'll oppose Trump's new Muslim ban, right? Seems like the beginning of a repeat to me
