U wot m8?
This tweet is really weird and pathetic coming from a US Senator. Why aren't more Iowans ashamed of you?
This is a crazy tweet. Can't understand a word.
He is praising Trump for a good tweet. 
:)
Dude! R we try 2 look hip!! Dude!
Huh?
I love this! A good team calls eachother out when they disagree or want something done, but praise when necessary. 
Healthy!

Curious timeline:
Wed—Trump calls Grassley to talk 'ethanol'
Thurs—Grassley raises Qs about Comey-Clinton 
Fri—Trump tweets Grassley news https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/903587428488839170 …

Can someone on Sen Grassley's staff teach him how to thread tweets please?
Because Grassley is pretending to be stupid - here you go sir!
A few thoughts in response to the latest slime-job by the President against Comey. I will keep this very brief. /1/ https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/903587428488839170 …

You suck Chuck.
There is nothing admirable about this administration.
Chuck what have you been smoking!?? You need to go to twitter school
Never thought I'd ever be cheering generals 4 usurping the role of elected president but these are strange times.
Are you giving the  child some candy?

Agreed!! We have a couple good Marines to keep things in order. Both respectable men. Semper Fi
English. Do you speak it MF?
Twitter is just not your thing, Chuck.
Chuck - tweets are free. Try breaking them up.
You grubby outreached hands are showing! Do your job, #ImpeachTrump, #Traitor45
Complicit.

Will you bring vote for release of 10-hour transcript for Steele Dossier....or have you been BOUGHT by Trump/ethanol????
fair question
Did you at least make him wear a condom? He did say STDs were his Vietnam you know.
Hey Senator, awful fishy Trump called you about ethanol before you interview his son and then magically a memo about Comey turns up.

Awww, don't mock the senile...
Do you ever say which of Mr Trump's tweets are inappropriate Mr Grassley?
On a side note, it is hard to envision Sen. @ChuckGrassley typing "Gr8" on any device.
Wow Sen. Grassley. You really got the haters in a tizzy. Ignore them and continue your awesome work for Iowa and the USA.
When abbreviations go too far: a cautionary tale.
GET TO A HOSPITAL YOU ARE HAVING A STROKE
Get a room guys
Where's a google "translate from WTF" option when you need it.
@StevenTDennis @realDonaldTrump shut up traitor Chuck. Are you drunk this early?
You're not making any sense...  you're losing it Chuckie!
Ok kiss ass
You, unfortunately are a racist. To Iowa's shame.
chuck what does this mean
Please stop. You are embarrassing yourself. It is troubling that we need these two to protect us from POTUS' impulses. Sad.
Bet he fires him soon. Way he operates. Let's help the Amer people Chuck. Harvey, healthcare, tax cuts for bottom 98%.Vaca all summer?
Chuck: are you thinking there's a Cabinet position with your name on it? Drunk tweeting is no way to impress.
You Need To Speak Up about inappropriate tweets #backbone

Yes, and as Mattis says... It's TIME TO INSPIRE
Thank you for your honesty Senator. Keep fighting the fight. We need to end DC corruption
This is the guy that we expecting to do an honest investigation of the #TrumpCrimeFamily & check the lunatic @potus. Not gonna happen folks
Ethanol conversation yesterday needs to be investigated...

Quid Pro Quo? Pay to play? Let's see the entire transcript.

Smells fishy.
They will be fired in the next few days. Can't you follow a pattern?
Hey Grassley: Despite Trump "ethanol" convo, do the right thing! 
History is watching. Trump has his place. What's yours?
Slurp...

Says the guy lying about Comey to cover Trump. The GOP is just AWFUL.
Have you discussed junior testifying with 45?

@ChuckGrassley has a new BFF. Guess what Chuck? @realDonaldTrump only wants your committee to go easy on him & his people re: #TrumpRussia
The Senator from Iowa does not get the credit he deserves for his contextually dense tweets. Bravo. 
You are proven criminal Traitor to USA Fraud Chuck Grassley,NETFLIX $60B Fraud loot racket Whistleblower screams
The generals are left to hold Trump accountable since the GOP Senate refuses.
Hey, tweet the President to let him know we will be protesting DACA actions at YOUR offices, Chuck.
You want to try tweeting in English, maybe?
.@ChuckGrassley = "Sycophant-in-Chief"
@ChuckGrassley @BobGoodlatte6 @TheJusticeDept @FBI @JEFF @jeffsessions @POTUS @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump @FinancialCmte
