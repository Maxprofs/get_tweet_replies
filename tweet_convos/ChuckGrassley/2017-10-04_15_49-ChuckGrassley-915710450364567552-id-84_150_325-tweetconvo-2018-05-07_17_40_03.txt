Chuck you still haven’t received a response from @TheJusticeDept in regards to #FANNIEGATE keep pushing for the docs https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/wp/2015/04/08/justice-department-gives-sen-grassley-a-lesson-on-how-to-do-his-job/ …
Now he does not want a response because his party is doing the final kill
Ah, nepotism.
Chuck Grassley seeking to expose US Intel sources & methods is ALL abt protecting Trump & Russia.  Grassley needs to register under FARA.
Speaking of 'Transparency': How about Trump's Tax Returns?! You Don't Seem Concerned about THAT or Obvious Trump/Russia Collusion!
Please stop the theft. #fanniegate. The shareholders are expecting reimbursement for the funds lost in the illegal sweep by Government
HOW ABOUT THE TRANSPARENCY OF YOUR INVESTIGATION OR LACK THERE OF ,INTO THE COLLLUSION BY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH RUSSIA! PAGE, MANAFORT
resign
State flexibility?
Trump told Health Department to deny Iowa's request to fix ObamaCare market: report http://hill.cm/yERRfkG  
Why are you trying to suppress/discredit the Steele dossier? Where's your sense of duty? Why are you @realDonaldTrump's lapdog? SHAME ON YOU

It starts with the Judges - everyone keeps ignoring the Corruption

Grassley staffer says the Judiciary Cmte isn't running a full Trump-Russia probe, just routine oversight of DOJ. https://www.thedailybeast.com/senate-russia-probe-is-not-really-investigating-russia-staffers-say …
Did Chuck know Trump would not allow your state to fix its healthcare system?  Shame.
Iowa wanted to fix its health insurance marketplace. Trump found out and personally said no. By @Eilperin http://wapo.st/2xXYqFw?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.9266c7a9d8c4 …
wtf is with Kushner still having a security clearance????
You tweeted more about this than what you’re going to do to curb gun violence #fubar priorities. Congrats on your cowardice.

Clearly they didn't do enough & too many Dems caved to NRA. But you've completed missed the specific pt  about Mr. Grassley's priorities.
Real problem in govt is people like you who put party before country!#TrumpRussia
There's absolutely nothing transparent about you, Chuck.
#JFKassassination,  
9/11 = #InsideJob
You do town hall meetings with your microphone purposely turned off so no one can hold you accountable to your words.
WTF...
You pledged to release the transcripts of the recent interview regarding the Steele memorandum. What happened?
Do something about the deep state, establishment go after lynch, coney and Clinton foundation your chairman
Full transparency: how about how much ur at beck & call of @NRA and its campaign $$$? https://twitter.com/essenviews/status/915986454517387264 … #AssaultWeaponsBan
GOP senator who received $50,000 from NRA slams any efforts for gun safety https://shareblue.com/gop-senator-who-received-50000-from-nra-slams-any-efforts-for-gun-safety/#.WdZmeRaXNtI.twitter … via @shareblue
Really appreciate  you insight and keeping us informed Senator. Keep up the good work.

"classification" aka, covering up criminal activity
That why you Protect Sessions getting executive privilege that wasn’t given. Don’t be a Hippocrate!  Transparency = answering questions
Grassley is NOT about protecting America frm a treasonous White House & Hostile Foreign State.  He's abt a Cover-up 2help them EVADE Mueller
All you are doing is attempting to discredit the Steele Dossier. You do not appear to be neutral, give up your Judiciary chair.
LMAO!! WHAT TRANSPARENCY! YOU'RE ALL A BUNCH OF LYING REPUGS!!! TAX CUTS ONLY BENEFIT THE RICH! DON'T CUT OUR MEDICARE/SS!!! WE PAID FOR IT!

Hey Chuck. I heard you RINO's are looking at new Anti-Firearms Legislation... The Queen of England would be proud of you.
Your normal gibberish, I see!
Please do not subsidize insurance companies 2 prop up Ocare. Country cannot afford it. We will never b rid of socialized healthcare if u do!
Ha ha ha, transparency in government.
It's horrifying Lola 
Term limits would be great.
***Call Trump & ask him.
How about some common senses gun laws?  How about renewing CHIP?
Transparency?! . GOOD ONE HYPOCRIT.
 Are you saying Comey  lied  ?Well digging for a crime  is evil & disgusting  - why didn't  you do that to obama's  crimes ?
 I'm sorry but there was supposed  to be a crime first so hiring him WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL  - Comey ws not investigating him
Sometime Senator I think it's too good to be true that you fight for the things you fight for. Thank you.
You’re right, transparency brings accountability.  When are you going to introduce a bill to let us see Trump’s tax returns?
What about transparency in our elections? Why do you continue to try and hamper the investigation into trump and Russia? Hmm?
#MerrickGarland
RIP Justice Scalia cause "wet works" doesn't mean pool parties in the vineyard.
Tbh if you don't release the records you will be met with pitchforks and torches!
It would be nice if we had more transparency in the current Russia investigation instead of beating up Hillary Clinton who isn't president.
So does punctuation, Senator.
Anyway, yes, they should be released.
Thank you Senatpr
i real problem in government is party hacks that toe a line without a thought to history, legacy, right or wrong... #gorsuch
Didn't they just release more?
I own a car and have to buy insurance, do gun owners?
This is your big priority? An assassination 54 years ago? Truly, please do Iowans a favor and resign.
is this a joke??
How about we get your buddy trump to release his tax returns then we can read about jfk later. Deal?
When we see Obama's college records. Good trade off?
A real problem is that you & the GOP are shills of the NRA - not to mention that you all condone Trump's recklessness & corruption.
How about a Resolution establishing real gun control like Australia? Anything less is a travesty. Don’t sell your integrity/honor to the NRA
Chicago has gun control and it's not working out too well.
Transparency after 25 years?How foolish. FOCUS on shitstorm trump & his transgressions NOW! #DoSomething for the nation... NOW! #TrumpRussia
Sigh. FOCUS! Children’s health insurance, a terrible tax plan, an increasingly obviously corrupt White House, natural disasters, shootings..
WE  BEG  YOU   - TELL ROSENSTEIN  TO  GIVE MUELLER  2 MORE MONTHS & THAT'S  IT --  ENOUGH --HE wants  to coup our  POTUS- we know
Agree with you on this one, Chuck.
AMERICANS   know there is no collusion - so  STOP THE CHARADE -- DEAR  JESUS  - deliver us from the  DEEP-EVIL-STATE-FIRE THEM TOO
Speak for yourself, fool.
AMERICANS   are sick of putting up  with Mueller  who peeks his nasty head out &  tries to intimidate everyone --FIRE HIM  PLEASE - PLEASE
We are sick  of paying them instead legislation  they spend everyday  spying out a needle in a haystack - Rosenstein - what in the world ?
SNAKE in the GRASSley...is part of a 400 mil Koch bribed & NRA funded GOP
Well   NOT  ONE PERSON  HAS OVERSITE  ON Mueller  who has  had time to do his job-he was to be hired to prove a CRIME - NOT LOOK FOR ONE
Bout that transparency bullshit. #TrumpRussia
Where’s @realDonaldTrump tax returns?

The Top 1% get nearly 80% of the Trump tax cuts.  Top .1% get nearly 40% of the cuts. This is absurd. 
Try being transparent about Gun, Insurance & Big Pharma donations to @GOP

Some things experts think could prevent mass shootings.
