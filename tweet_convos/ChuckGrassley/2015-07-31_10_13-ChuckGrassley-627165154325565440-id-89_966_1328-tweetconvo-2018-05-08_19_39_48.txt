@ChuckGrassley I'm not even a Republican, but I'll give credit where credit is due. Well done, sir! Ingenuity at its finest!

Try it this way. Even less work!
@ChuckGrassley Senator you're a genius, maybe you can put this problem-solving ability to work fixin' that clown show in DC amirite
@justinsreedy @ChuckGrassley Pretty sure he has already been there for 40 years. If he was fixing anything, you'd think it'd be done by now.
@ntlarue (I was being facetious, I don't think Chuck is actually capable of helping)
@justinsreedy It is hard to judge sarcasm in text form.Also, there are people who actually would say that and believe in what they're saying
@ntlarue Fair!
Lots of air emissions though 
these RTs are the absolute best
hmm. well I guess we grassley underestimated you then @ChuckGrassley @jonnysun
