USA no longer a full democracy! #resist #impeach http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/25/us-is-no-longer-a-full-democracy-eiu-warns.html … @luckyginnie3
show me the word "democracy" anywhere in our Constitution we should shut up about democracy
because we're not one. We're an oligarchic republic end route to fascism
We're supposed to be a constitutional republic, which is a form of representive democracy
a representative republic is not necessarily a democracy. The USA case is an example

the Constitution makes no mention of democracy, the founders despised it
You can't just make shit up, we are a form of a democracy
SenGrassley pls begin the impeachment process. This is not normal. #ImpeachmentSoon +if you want to talk to Trump use @potus
#TeachingTwitterToSenators #WeAreScrewed
Ask Merrick Garland to do it for you
Hey Chuck, try @POTUS or @realDonaldTrump it might work better for you  
not POTUS,itsUNSECURE PERSONAL ANDROID2access hisUNSECURED PERSONALacct ONLY for DJT!
you didn't under stand my tweet at all.
@charlesornstein also as long as we're asking for stuff can he make the Monday after the super bowl a federal holiday?
The NFL should just move the stupid game to Saturday.
And this is our President, sir all the years you've logged in politics and it has come to this moment. Reflection hurts.
You broke it, you bought it. You support a man (DT) with NO moral center, no ethical center, & he will get rich off us
They won't comply. Deep down you know you helped unleash a monster. Use the leverage you have. DO NOT CONFIRM SESSIONS
What happened to this @ChuckGrassley Suggest you find him & support #investigatetrump #impeachandconvicttrump #resist #MarchForTruth #aclu
Spare is this BS tweet abt getting docs. You're a GD US senator - as if you have no other option. Have your staff call 
.@ChuckGrassley Please allow Judiciary Com to question Sen Sessions about his work w/Trump on Exec Orders & Muslim Ban. Voters right to know
Here is how you can reach your president:
@mf_buckley Could you get his tax returns while you are at it?
How's that Trump Treason investigation coming?
This is pitiful. Your president is pitiful.
@PresTrump Iowa NICE. Where's the Love? Thanks for amusing us and wasting time and money. #AlternateReality #AlternateFacts
Grow  a pair and begin impeachment proceedings NOW. This is insanity and you KNOW IT. Show some integrity.the
.@ChuckGrassley Try @-ing him, and add a veiled insult, I think that's the only way to get his attention.
make sure you mention "crowd size" too!
Did he ever reply?  Lol.
How unprofessional  #EmbarrassingPOTUS what's next? CANDY CRUSH??
Just like calls for his income taxes? You see how well that worked.
You don't seem to see the absolute danger to the constitution that the man represents. Don't bow to the cult of Trump.
If he doesn't want fed. agencies to communicate facts or appreciate them in the news why in the hell would he do it for you?
Yeah he's not going to do that, Senator. He's going to do the opposite of that. You guys better realize that quickly.
Great idea Chuck, while we're at it, can you start releasing Senator's records to the public, so we can have some oversight ?
ThankGODthat qualified,experiencedSMART lady who was CLEARED of every bogus thing thrown her way didn't win,huh?Am I right!?
You are the law. Don't beg, Subpoena. Show up with the FBI if that's what it takes. You and Trump work for the people!
@sahilkapur you're pathetic   Go run over a deer.  You're only skill.  #DeersDead
prez doesn't know what this "oversight" is  U might need to impeach him soon #ImpeachmentSoon #MrMinority
Have your grandkids show you how  to work the Twitter. In the meantime, try adding @POTUS or @realDonaldTrump to your tweet.
did you ever ask the same of Obama??
Yeah Chucky I'm sure he'll get right around to letting you oversee him and the West Wing... Right after he's done watching tv
Please make sure you use the @ sign and his Twitter handle so he might actually see this. #twitterbasics
that's kinda a "wow" moment
yes, interesting to see.  Oversight is more important now than it ever has been.
well, yeah, but shocking that a Republican would dare say anything about it.
indeed it is.
.@ChuckGrassley You sure didn't care about oversight when it came to Merrick Garland. Your abdication and partisanship was disgraceful.
yeah good luck dealing with that fascist while your constituents die
Should we trust any of you ? Seems after Ryan's interview w/Greta you are afraid of DT.We now have state control radio ?????
Uh, @ChuckGrassley, you've been around a while. You've heard of ability to subpoena and, since 1857, hold in contempt of Congress, right?
@PekingMike come on chuck baby you know no congessional oversight is needed. Trust me signed @#donthecon
Do you need us to forward this to @realDonaldTrump @POTUS and @WhiteHouse? That's what you pay your staff to do.
@JoshRosner Are you saying OB denied this request or did you merely not request the records from FHFA and Treasury reg  GSEs
wow, you woke up?
get his@tax returns while you're at it. Thanks.
Pls Demand an Independent Commission to investigate Russian espionage- get it out of Congress so WH can't sabotage it.
@divemate I hope he drains the swamp and out you go! #draintheswamp why not question your criminal friends @SenBobCorker
you should try and at him, bro.
You forgot the "@" thingy. He'll never see it now.
hold your head up and do the right thing!!
chuck, you need to tweet @realDonaldTrump for him to get your official request.   Don't worry, just took care of it 4 u.
does that include a certain someone's tax returns?
Senator Grassley, our country is in very serious trouble. Please defend our constitution.
trying to get Merrick Garland's information???!
This is how our elected officials communicate now?
Have you tried contacting him at @realDonaldTrump? DJT might hear you. @RepUnderwoodSC says it's #1 rule.
If a GOP Senator has to tweet to get the fraudulent four's attention, where does that leave the American people?
he doesn't need to issue an order, it's the law: 5 USC 7211 Employees' right to petition congress
oversight? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Betsy Devos $$$=cabinet position...hahahahahahahah oversight, you slay me.
Don't vote on them until they do! Time for some spine.
Could you also ask about senior WH staff's private email server?
That's funny from the party that tried to choose the ethics committee.
let the hose job begin.
He's your guy now. We tried to tell you he was a con man. Obsfucating trick shot artist. No plan?
Welcome to our world!
lol he's not following you on twitter
@sahilkapur u must b joking
R u finally bothered by DT doing whatever he wants?  At what point does he make u all vote yourselves out of a job?
Haha. Hahaha! As if you give a shit. Actions count. Tweets don't.
this is what you get for supporting incompetent "leader" w/ fascist tendencies. It's time you retire anyway.
Good luck on that one Chuck. You've created a monster.
exactly how @POTUS @realDonaldTrump should get your tweets... agree w others looks like a show than a request @mike_pence @VP
Starting to rethink your support yet?
@hotcoffeeandpie hahaha - you'll get only docs Trump is willing to give you buttercup. #alternativefacts
Please impeach @realDonaldTrump if he doesn't! The president must respect separation of powers and checks balances.
"Blackout of info and culling of scientific data is equivalent of a digital era book burning". #Resist #ScienceMarch
Then what? Say you get records saying they did what is in any newspaper? It don't mean shit unless you start locking them up.
Merrick Garland. We didn't forget. Your fascism is showing up more and more. Hubris then nemesis that's how it'll go.
Chuck, stop your embarassment. Now.
You let this guy become Party Leader w/o getting tax returns! TRUMP™ not following his own poor plan.
Trump Hotels will triple locations in US expansion, CEO says http://bloom.bg/2ktkBzE  
Sir, you have to @realDonaldTrump
why do you think this is actually going to happen. The man is a liar
Will you be requesting the president to release his tax returns so we, and theoretically you lol, can do oversight
Yeah I'll bet he'll get right on that, Senator.
@TheBradBlog senator, what did you expect?  He will never fully disclose information to Congress.  He refused tax returns
@thebradblog It's Sad State, When A U.S. Senator Has To Tweet Out To The President To Communicate With.
Chuck just needs to stay awake when he does meet with Trump
These POS desecrating the White House. I can't even look at this photo
He showed you who he was for the past 40 years. You voted in a kleptocrat who plays by his rules. He's not Iowa nice is he?
Or else what?  Your Conference has the backbone of a jellyfish.  Stand up to Trump now or forever hold your peace. #hypocrisy
YOU  VOTED  FOR  HIM!!
The @WhiteHouse is suppressing newly created petitions! Sign this one before it's too late. 16,000 strong https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/donald-trump-resign-president-united-states-violation-emoluments-clause-release-your-tax-returns … 
perhaps if you use @POTUS or @realDonaldTrump he might read it. Otherwise it's a facade
How about oversight of his ethical conflicts?  Oversight of his gag orders on public information? It's the WH you need review
you are fooling nobody with this little bit of theater. You not only helped put him there, you handed him a SUPCO seat. Sad.
.@ChuckGrassley you have to tweet at him so he hears you here I'll do it HEY @realDonaldTrump A REPUBLICAN SENATOR (that's ur team) HAS A Q
@sahilkapur he won't chief. Congress had already failed the American people in this regard
not what you expected chris?
only interesting in that it was a Republican that was literally in his office day before. Wanted public request
now?
@sahilkapur quit staling!!!  There's a country to run.
as if.  And you'll do WHAT when he doesn't?  Roll over and play dead?
more of this please Senator.  Thank you for this.
shocking this would come from you I thought you only complained about Democrats
While we’re grandstanding, Senator, please do all you can to get the corn out of my gasoline.
lord, this is SAD
Good luck with that.  (Hey, while you're at it do you think you could also ask him for his tax returns?)
you forgot to @realDonaldTrump @POTUS or he'll never fucking see it.
did you forget to mention this when you met yesterday? Maybe you need his supporters to tell cause he listens to us. @potus
you have the credibility of a chocolate coin in a poker game. YOu created this with vengeful partisan hacks. #Untrustable
Thank you, Senator.
He cant' hear you, he's watching TV
NETFLIX $60B loot Encyclopedia debate with Fraud Congress now http://variety.com/2016/biz/news/reed-hastings-slams-donald-trump-1201802091/ … … … … … … DRAIN THE SWAMP
Stay on him, Senator.  Senate GOP one of the strongest bulwarks against him potentially.
at least TRY to get in his mentions. Christ.
Hmmm. Tell us exactly what information they're not giving you. American public is interested!
got to tag him my man, but otherwise excellent way to get in touch
im still waiting for the congress to vote on garland for supreme court. Republicans dont do shit-why should their fake pres?
are you out of your mind? Do you not yet understand who and what you're dealing with?
@ZekeJMiller @HouseGOP @SenateRepCaucus ICYMI No Daily Schedule #Advance?
good luck with that.  YOUR president is a fruitcake
Geez, Is this where we are? Begging the Leader to follow the principles of our democracy thru tweets?  Terrifying.
maybe next you can tweet him about seeing a psychiatrist
@ZekeJMiller LOL nice try Chuckie, we know you don't do oversight of Republicans
Or else what?
No one is fooled. If you believed in proper oversight you wouldn't be in the Benghazi/Emails party. Place a hold on a nominee & I'll rethink
Pro tip. You might want to actually address @POTUS. Just a hint.
lol!!
I don't think I've had the honor of RT'ing the senior Senator from IA up to now

Felt good
oh quit being silly Chuck. Your so old skool.
Pick up the phone. It's your staffers who say that's the best way to reach a gov't official. Tweeting is for show.
What do you want, Senator? NIST's Cryptographic Technology group is at your service.
Oversight starts with proper vetting of nominees - NO RUBBER STAMPS! Next investigate the gag orders.
"Oversight" you mean.... IF you care, you will block @POTUS and any further requests.
