@ChuckGrassley It's so nice to see someone politicizing the attack rather than expressing sympathy.
@ChuckGrassley You couldn't type "says"? Why is "Crime" capitalized? This is embarrassing. (Note I was able to squeeze in a period.)
“@ChuckGrassley: Pres Obama sez no more war.. Is Grassley an idiot?
@ChuckGrassley why must you harvest misguided conflict from tragedy? It's unfortunate you consider yourself a leader. #pleaseresign
.@ChuckGrassley Did you have another aneurysm?
@ChuckGrassley It's c0ld outside. Iz o'Bama 2 blame?
@ChuckGrassley what about the attack on the #NAACPBombing? Any thoughts on that? Or do we not care about Black Lives?
@CoFemale @ChuckGrassley Ohhh so if no one dies it doesn't count as intent to terrorize? mmkay. #hypocritical
@CoFemale @ChuckGrassley fair point- however the lack of any coverage speaks to the values of the nation. Spoiler- not good.
@ChuckGrassley weakness is shown by disunity
@ChuckGrassley You are a liar and fool, Senator. I do not even believe 'you' believe what you tweet. Just playin' to your audience. #tcot

@ChuckGrassley Really? You bring Obama into this tragedy? You are a sad, sad man.
