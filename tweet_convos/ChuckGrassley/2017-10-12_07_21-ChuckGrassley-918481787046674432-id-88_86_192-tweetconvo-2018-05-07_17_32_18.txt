By supporting a huge tax cut for the 1% at the expense of middle class and fed deficit, u r the BIGGEST SOB a IA momma has ever produced.
Pray that the Republicans Don’t Get Anything Done! They just make thing Worse! & Chucky’s Brain Does Not Work so you Don’t want Him Doing it
How about the CBO instead of your "own self Fact Checker" Chuck. Your numbers have been a little sketchy the past few decades.
The GOP got in bed with Trump and woke up with fleas. 
Worse than fleas...
I would say an incurable virus is more accurate metaphor.
Woke up with a decapitated Russian hooker
And the FSB has tapes...

In fact, the 1%ers are the ones who will benefit the most.
1, Chuck Grassley is a LIAR who refuses to do his job as a senator. He is complicit in the coverup of Trump’s Russian Collusion, Sessions -
PERJURY, and attempt at normalizing @realDonaldTrump ‘s CONSTANT and obvious lies! Resign, CHUCK! Russian tool!
Russian KGB/GRU AGENT AND TREASONOUS TRAITOR Grassley and @RepGoodlatte trying to help Russians STEAL 2020 for Trump/Pence @DMRegister
Checking His Fact Checker
Someone who both work and disagree with POTUS... Solid tweets congressman!

Has your GOP pervert in chief resigned yet? And by the way, Chuck, I am not paying for his moronic wall!
*reads*

*re-reads*

Are you drunk?
And those of us that itemize deductions will get a tax INCREASE
cc @realDonaldTrump
are you satisfied with yourself? you have irredeemably committed premeditated genocide against your fellow man. You helped helped him.
He only means for the 1%! He is not interested in helping the needy.
Just when are you guys going to be done stealing from the working class?
You guys need to wake up and get this disaster out of the White House. Do your job ! @GOP @SenateDems
@realDonaldTrump there fixed @ChuckGrassley....you bunch if greedy mofos
Chuck, not afraid anymore? The Emperor has no clothes? Thank you &. welcome to the Resistance !!!!
Your own fact checker?! Do you use the same one as our liar in chief @realDonaldTrump ?! 
#Complicit
Dont believe anything he says!
No facts from gassley just nothing....he is too busy ruining America for everyone but the ultra rich. No morals, no ethics, no truth.
You voted for him to be president
How do you know what he did in the voting booth?! @Ariuszme @ChuckGrassley
For Christ’s sake Chuck. You’re as big a bonehead as Trump. Retire already. You sure as hell aren’t doing any service to Iowa, or the US. In fact, you were the initial crack at destroying the Justice department. You’re done.
Not the first time he's overstated the size of something of his @realDonaldTrump
How'd that work out for the country Chuck? Based on the results, should we do it again? Just say NO
@realDonaldTrump 
Just making sure this gets where it was aimed as well. I love backing up the backed up back ups. ;-)
Just curious if he will be known as Widdle Chuck or something else @realDonaldTrump
thanks for correcting his baldfaced lies
Retweet
This from the maggot who helped steal Obama's SCOTUS nomination
it's a swindle!
Your “self fact checker” has no credibility at all. You’re lack of integrity has burned any credibility you may have once had
Wrong account Senator Grassley, we will tag blotus for you.
I think Chuck is on the list for Alzheimer’s med delivery that goes to Congress

You mean @realDonaldTrump
and who will benefit most?  ...
Are you on board or not? Seems to me the voters sent you the clearest-of-all-clear messages last Nov, Sen Grassley - #getwiththeprogram
WTF are you doing?
You feeble old man. No wonder you let Russia take over our White House.
It will be a disaster like every thing he does
you're barely literate
Come home Chuck, you need a nap.
Being a self checker leads to a 69% decrease in terminal testicular cancer diagnoses.
Your fact checker isn't working very well because @realDonaldTrump didn't get this.
Does your "fact checker" work on #TrumpLies? Is the @GOP to allow #Trump to keep deceiving America daily?
@ChuckGrassley staffer make sure Chuck gets the right account next time and teach Chuck how to thread tweets.
How about if you turn all of your "investigation" work over to Mueller, & remove .@realDonaldTrump.  .@GOP can still push agenda afterwards
What is this Senator, a competition between male egos? 
So what is giving you courage now?  His approval numbers being this low?
Who’s this @reslDonaldTrump poseur?  Lol Twitter is hard
Typo
@realDonaldTrump 

Cmon Grassley
Chuck you're the problem with Washington, just shut it down, you're a clown and a lifer.  You'd not make it in the private sector.
I'll believe the @POTUS before I believe anything u say senator. The entire Senate chambers are filled with nothing but liars like you.
Cc @realDonaldTrump
Trump's history of false, racist, misogynistic, hateful statements
all met with silence from Chuck.
But size of tax cut gets Chuck ruffled?
NO,NONE,..understanding wat tax-cuts did to the state of Kansas Chuck?...come on,be http://real.Healthcare  is a bigger issue than tax cuts!
Can you please hurry and remove Trump from office? Asking for America!
Don't petty argue w a good sales pitch, Senator, especially since Trump's seemingly the only Republican who gives a damn.
Grassley: how about you have an investigation instead of a cover up into Russia
try again Chuck. RePost. Hey we all do that. I do that too. Go for it. Call him out @realdonaldtrump Hey you're lying again DON.
Hey Chuck! You may want to check your spelling on your POTUS tag. @realDonaldTrump won't get that truth bomb you're trying to drop.
Don't tweet and it is bigger than the one u backed and got passed,OH
Why are federal judges being held up?
U may not be talking to who U think U R. Also, learn to type like a person who was educated in Iowa.
Fact: wrong acct for POTUS
lol
Please REMIND of the OATH he took to DEFEND the 1st Amendment.  He seems to think he can SILENCE THE PRESS.
The press silenced themselves

The FY18 Budget gives $1.5TRIL in tax cuts to the richest Americans. It cuts about the same from Medicaid & Medicare. Whose side are you on?
