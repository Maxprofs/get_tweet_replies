all these whiners in here don't get that you WON the election Senator. They're just crybabies
You're a cry baby! Come on! Whatever!!!
I mean I have to give him credit for once
Exactly!  And no arts or entertainment on A&E!  What happened?
have you tried the Smithsonian channel?
Do you even read History books? The Dictionary or Wiki? BLAH is what you sound like.
And i am A REPBULICAN
@daveweigel history channel won't show how you stole a scotus seat from a sitting president
if you want to confirm a Supreme Court Justice, win the Senate.
do you want a list of Bush circuit court nominees never considered?
Future HISTORY CHANNEL show: 'Grassley: Putting Politics Ahead of Country' 
(as a former Iowan, I'm ashamed of you)
@ChuckGrassley
You are of low character. Refusing to hold hearings on Garland damaged our country. And you know it.
Just curious. why is a TV station a priority & Russian intrusion into the sovereignty of the USA not a priority?
OMG!!! AMEN!!! :)
Dont you think you should be concentrating on learning Russian? I understand #ComradeTrumpov will test you by 2018 #CCPutin
how are you my senator?
Soon they will have you and the rest of the corrupt senate for sale to the 1%.

@kasie dufus
That's what happens when u privatize everything. Some things shouldn't be for profit:prisons, VA, SS, healthcare,publicschool
what if you are doomed to repeat history because selfish Republican Senators pawned a SCOTUS seat to Donald Trump?
or gutted #VRA and guaranteed a fascist to takeover a major party.
was it really a takeover or is Trump just more open about where the GOP has been for awhile now?
Takeover. Recall #NeverTrump?
there's always a group that rejects their party's nominee. Recall PUMAs in '08
they came around.
@Chris___Cote
lol @austinfrank

"Press Secretary to handle my Twitter? Nah, I got this" - Chuck Grassley probably
press secretary? Grassley don't do press secretary!
When you're in a senate hearing and remember the deer you hit back in 2012 while driving on highway 136 south of Dyersville.
Lol
LOVE IT
@JasonLouMiller how about the history show where they tell about #scotus obstructionists? #DoYourJob
Since nothing good is on TV, maybe you can get off your butt, do your job, and approve Obama's Supreme Court Justice nominee
You probably were hoping for Porn Stars ... RETIRE!!!
WTF Chuck? #DoYourJob
SO SO tired of non-History on that channel. "HISTORY". #showmehistorynotcrap
Don't you have something better to do?
I've told you before Senator. History being educational, isn't profitable television. You'll find what you want on PBS.
Beaut.
Or just watch PEOTUS DJT PORN STAR
@shannonwoodward Sad.
Hey @ChuckGrassley looks like you got some free time today...
Nothing to apologize for. Maybe he should go golfing with his free time. 
Jesus on a pogo stick w/ an ice cream cone, u have more important things 2 focus on than tweeting re: History Channel!!!
It's the worst! There is no history on The History Channel anymore, and no Supreme Court confirmation hearings on CSPAN!
Really? This is where you spend your time and energy? As a Xmas gift, someone should give you a clue.
I guess @ChuckGrassley sees no irony in complaining about a lack of educational TV while helping elect a reality TV star. #spoileralert
thanks Chuck
you fill me with deep sadness.
@Olivianuzzi usually reruns, thats technically history. Right?
If you want history on television, watch what I watch: ESPN Classic!
#doyourjob
At least now we know why you don't understand the constitution.
Trump has a friend in the Senate who also writes like a child @ChuckGrassley
@geoffreyvs Best twitter account in Congress
Srsly there are so many great things they could cover; formation of pol parties, Gilded Age, Antebellum era etc.
@lachlan I am so bothered by the lack of history on history channel. Lack of music on music television...death on lifetime...
this is why it's important to fund PBS!
I'd take your complaint more seriously if the GOP believed in science.
Your History Channel rage is the only good thing about you
History Channel, NatGeo, and like ilk all rewriting history to fit Left's view, for last several years.
hour after hour after hour after hour
Is this supposed to be a diversion while you guys in the GOP steal our Social Security and Medicare?
@woodruffbets If you knew anything about history you'd know you have no time to watch TV. Get off that La-Z-Boy. Do your job!
cc @byrdinator
You are the Chumlee of the Senate.
You can go to the Senate and watch Grassley Oh he is Never there! Only in Office watching History Ch! & Tweeting !
Is it any wonder that Congress hasn't done anything to help Veterans? Yet you still act surprised at every suicide.
.@ChuckGrassley maybe u can get some of ur donor friends at major cable companies and superpacs to get it canned b
Take Chuck's phone.
Iowa, please, I'm begging you, chuck Grassley!
I suspect that you & most of your fellow senators were honorable civil servants at one time, you work for us Sir. #RESISTANCE
You have got to be kidding me! Time to retire Chuck.  You have completely sold your soul and become an embarrassment to Iowa.
@RLTPD 
great to know you're learning about "history" 
Organizing for the inauguration?
Get 'em, Senator
This is the circuses part of Bread and Circuses, folks. #GOP #SCOTUS @ChuckGrassley
@Boydie02 @molonlabe1988  
What?
@daveweigel Didn't some company buy History channel? Fox?
dude maybe if you #DoYourJob you wouldn't have to worry about what's on the History channel
I am glad this is the hill you have chosen to die on.
@_lillyyu did you show me this forever ago?? he's AMAZING
there is more history on PBS. Please support funding of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting!
dude your campaign against "history in the making" history channel has gone on for long enough. It's fruitless
History will judge you and your unprecedented obstruction. It will not be kind. #doyourjob
@fart but they have motherfucking #VIKINGS!

Does he know that "Pawn Stars" viewership skews overwhelmingly Republican?
you are still alive?  #whoknew
2016 not over yet...
I see you're working on the Trump Twitter Starter Course. Do something else.
Happy to see you are over that whole stealing a Supreme Court seat thing.
@kasie Pretty soon you will see the Federal government doing the same thing!
Anyone who watches Pawn Stars likes fake reality.
.@ChuckGrassley actually, Rick always provides history lessons on the articles being offered for purchase.
@TheChrisSuprun ugh
- I wish you & the @GOP were history. What an effing nightmare this country has become
#Regression
Maybe if HC showed more history you'd understand what #fascism was before you backed @realDonaldTrump.
how is this a real tweet from a US senator?
I'm an Iowan and I vote. #DoYourJob #SCOTUS
Do your job old man!
@kasie we just don't like revisionist history.
QUIT YOUR JOB
what about this fraud financial terrorist take over of USA in 1913?https://thegreattranceformation.wordpress.com/2015/09/21/federal-reserve-crime-scene/ … 99% WEALTH STOLEN BY 1% in usa
Economic sabotage is Treason. Fraud congress/senate https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMFR3HhOZfI … netflxi $60b loot ponzi from 99% and above law
Pawn Stars, American Picker, Ancient Aliens... when do they ever air a show about history? They're misnamed...
Do not like your failure to hold hearings for Judge Garland. #Pathetic
@torriangray
Time to put down the remote and look up "narcissistic personality disorder".
@daveweigel 
lol, @HISTORY doesn't do actual history if they can help it. @Disney owns it.
Where's Giorgio?
No kidding. History Channel hasn't been about actual history for a long, long time. Pathetic.
didn't you take a snowball onto the senate floor to disprove climate change?
no that was @jiminhofe who doesn't understand science and climate
my bad... sorry.. thank you! @republicansrbad @ChuckGrassley @jiminhofe
Pawn Stars is like if you took Antiques Roadshow, but dumbed it down so the only items were guitars and guns
this is a good tweet. you stole a Supreme Court seat
good tweet sir good tweet
If I recall, we argued about the History Channel when I was at WMT . HA maybe they lured you back
@sambills94
but Chuck what if I don't like history or PAWN STARS?
Jesus Chrisdt! This what you spend your time doing, you putz!
Your Moby Dick, Sir. Rage forever against this great injustice.
Who does @ChuckGrassley hate more? The History Channel or Deer?
Your recent tweets suggest you watch a lot of History Channel, but I can't tell if you enjoy it.
