@POTUS is too buy pimping his golf courses to read the TrumpCare bill.  Could you send him a picture book that explains it to him?
though ppl are telling u to vote no.when u leave office all of u should lose ur health care and money too
Less than 30% of Iowans support your plan to gut health care. Who do you represent? https://uw-media.desmoinesregister.com/amp/479841001 
Comrade Obstruchuck
Thank you Senator for staying in touch with your constituents. Most Iowans support you and the job you are doing.
Did you speak out for family values you can't claim for your own conduct. Your conduct as chair of Judiciary is prime example.
Approving Gorsuch for SCOTUS does not absolve your sins against Garland. This did not demonstrate integrity or honesty.
As an Iowan I am appalled that you have thrown a career of integrity away for the likes of Trump and McConnell.
Your GOP is not the GOP Iowa Republicans support.  It may not be too late to recover your reputation but time is running out.
Pls vote no on AHCA! It's bad for Iowans. For once listen to your constituents & not the People who bought you.

Few noticed when Sessions' DOJ settled Russia money laundering case in May. It is key to the Russia collusion probe? http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/attytood/ag-sessions-the-russian-lawyer-and-the-money-laundering-case-that-went-away-20170717.html …
- cut spending in GOV.take cap off social security get to COMEY&LYNCH felony laws broken gov records act unmasking etc
Deeply ashamed of our country's leadership failing to speak out against incessant lies and attempted collusion. http://www.businessinsider.com/trumps-lawyer-jay-sekulow-russia-meeting-2017-7 … @gop
Another violation of Sessions' recusal?

SUPPORT the bill. I have administered ACA as employer and suffered it as a consumer. It is a diaster.  Ins market now dead. NOT AFFORDABLE.

Trump defenders:
Two weeks ago: Was no collusion.
Last week: Collusion not illegal.
Now: Collusion perfectly reasonable.…
With Bob Vander Plaats there I wouldn't consider this a Leadership Summit
- democrats are being disruptive to USA dreams - cut death tax no insurance subsidies repeal give open insurance to USA !
YOU ARE A TRAITOR!
Get Pres Trump's nominations thru!!
sad part of all this is ur keeping Obama care for urself and family and taking it away like Medicaid do u think the ppl are
nothing to him.time for a replacement he is backing dump trump if iowans are smart like i think time for change new blood
mr.grassley is not listen to the ppl of ia he only cares about himself and his family he has pently of money ppl of ia mean
So you come to DSM for the Grassley faithful but you serve all. No on AHCA.
Did you stand up for honesty and integrity in government?  No?  Because you aren't being honest or performing your job with integrity?
We need to see justice of Hillary corruption. Please!

This corruption is something the GOP Congress could relatively easily rein in—probably with just a few subpoenas and hearings—if they cared. https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/886407549096009730 …
You do not need to be re-elected, nor protect what you built. Now is the time to cleanse your soul.  Now is the time to right your wrongs.
#TrumpRussia
Perhaps the Russians know your sins.  Perhaps they hold many secrets.  Do not let them betray your soul or our founding fathers.
Jesus believes in forgiveness, but first you must repent. You  know POTUS is not a man of God. Theocracy by force is not his will. Repent!
How about sending out some subpoenas!! Instead of kowtowing to the DEMS and letting them lead these investigations.YOUR THE MAJORITY! COWARD
Has your GOP pervert in chief resigned yet?
https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/886294701892145152 …
still pandering to the radical right?
As long as no one in your family is gay, Muslim, POC... amirite? This is a hate group.
What IS NOT going to be a pleasure is the number of Iowans who will suffer if you vote for TRUMPCARE! #NoRepealNoReplace #VoteNo
Dear Mr. Grassley, you're doing a great job on the Russia investigation. Keep up the good work!
And the families deserve decent insurance - meaning a no vote on the bill!  I assume you told them that!!

Mr. Grassley.
Why did you make members of Congress exempt from #ACHA and retain all benefits of #Obamacare ?  
#TrumpCrimeFamily #Trumpcare
I missed that
I suppose you reminded everyone the #Trump saga is nothing more than a #witch hunt. A #hoax 

#TrumpCrimeFamily  #TrumpRussia
Senator, vote against the healthcare bill in the senate!
Family leadership Summit? That's rich coming from a party that wants to take from poor & middle class & give to the rich. Greed. No values!
In the support of family, please vote no on the GOP healthcare bill, which benefits virtually no one in Iowa.
Did you talk about Russia and the Trumps?
Thank you for your leadership. Wish the #RINO WOULD work as hard and legitimate
Vote no on taking health care away!
Were you getting advice from those fake christians on how to cut healthcare for the old and poor? The GOP coup won't work by the way.
Gonna show them your Merrick Garland butt plug?
Thank you for this public tweet after your private meeting.
Now, please do your job and fully repeal the Johnson Amendment. Trump's exec order was a great start... now we need YOU to do your part!
Keep your religious horseshit to yourself.
These guys just love to tell people how to live their lives.  Health care.  You intend to exempt yourself from healthcare bill?  Why?
The theme is Principle over Politics". Really? Since when? #DoNothingGOP #PenceMetWithRussians #FireIvanka #RussianCollusion #TrumpsATraitor
TRAITOR
U should be the #PatriotNotPartisan leader I know u can b. #DoYourJob & what is #Right4Iowa Make sure all have available/affordable HC.
You should go check out #revolutioniowa next door to find a bunch of ppl who actually want to provide for families
How many of those families will lose their health insurance when you vote for the devastating AHCA?
Does this include your Russian family?
Please tell truth healthcare bill not good & how we have probable cause to investigate Trump team. Truth your grandkids will respect later.
Why is .@GOP complicit in allowing Jared security clearance?! Our democracy deserves more than this! #unethical #unamerican
Vote against the healthcare bill! Show that you actually have a conscience and care about Americans.
How can you be blind if the problem with ObamaCare.

Did you hang out with Russians as at the National Prayer Breakfast?
Even insurance companies think your bill is unworkable junk. You will make things worse.
Reject this bill.

This veteran is doing whatever she can to protect her son from the Republican health care bill 
That takes balls for you to speak at this meeting when you want to kill millions of family members by voting for this latest HC catastrophe.
Not really. It's a "conference" of people who believe the only legitimate families are those of straight cis Christians. So...hypocrites.
Families require health care to thrive. Did you mention that you plan to take it away from millions?
Please vote NO to AHCA!! Iowans and the Country need you to step up and vote NO!! #SaveTheACA #HowTheACASavedMe #VoteNO @SenJoniErnst PLEASE
Why did you want Akhmetshin gone from the country earlier this summer, Senator Grassley?
Must be all rich, white men. Sadly, there are a lot of families lead by struggling single mothers.
