5.5M IT jobs offshored since 2000.  $385B in wages and $96B in Gov revenue lost annually. Cancel #H1Bs & you kill offshoring!
Cancel #H1Bs and the jobs will actually go to offshore.. like .. OFF the US shores..
Nice try!  Jobs won't go offshore without #H1Bs working onsite to gather customer requirements. #Ban #H1Bs
True story 2010: 30 workers in a US Office working on tech. 2017: 6 in US office with 50 in India.
.. and you cant blame H1Bs for this one...
#H1Bs are an economic disaster for American workers and families. #H1B program doesn't need reform it needs to be cancelled!
2/2 ..the gap with H1Bs. Honestly find me the US citizens to fill it, and we will hire them ...like yesterday..
$110 is lowball offer to justify #H1B.  U bid on MSA, can't pay mkt rate salary, make margin & pass it 2 customer.
91% of US households earn below 110Kpa.  Thats 91% of US population who will be happy .. if the qualify.
This should be a bipartisan issue. Yes, the President should intervene with a call to Congress to end this program!
When will the House, Senate and @POTUS act to end the job and wage killing #H1B visa program?  Americans are sick of #H1Bs
Citibank uses 100s of First Derivatives contractors on E2 investor visas @$30000 2 replace Americans @$100,000
Perhaps if more $ was spent on education not the military, we wouldn't need H1B workers that have the skills Americans don't
add training. Have 5 jobs - cant find americans to do it.. will pay $110Kpa..those who apply are no skilled enough
Completely!  Most higher ed schools now need to focus on teaching applicable skills as much/more than theory.
It's a shame that lawmakers don't understand challenges facing the modern workforce so propose 19th cent solutions
The #H1B ripoff has been going on for 23+ years.  Why does it take a 60 minutes story to get Congress to wakeup?    #NoH1Bs
Monday another 65,000 H-1B visas will go out and 65,000 US-born tech workers will be displaced or skipped over for jobs @POTUS
what's the wage floor in your bill?
Thank you Chuck!  Please check out the IT Awan Bothers hired by Dem's that fled to Pakistan!
Make sure we get info from Dem's like Humas server.  Don't let them hide from Benghazi and other leaks
Already debunked as Russian propaganda, spread by colluding GOP. Great profile identifier. Blocking.
Senator, #H1B visa program is a DISASTER!!! Please help American Workers and Graduates buried in debt with no jobs prospects.
Degrees in History, Psychology don't get you engineering jobs. Americans need Science, Math, and Engineering.
The issue is about abuse by corps.There is no shortage in the segment that corps are mainly filling with #H1B
Corporations are looking for Engineers and Scientists. Today's manufacturing jobs require math and engineers.
The issue is a bit more complex. #H1B workers should be given a Green Card and not be attached to the employer.Abuse will stop.
doesn't the president use this for Mar-A-Lago employees?
Trump uses H2B visas at Mar-a-Lago which are seasonal work visas. They're much different than #H1B visas.
They're still taking American's jobs and Trump is personally guilty of using these H2B foreign workers.
@POTUS   During his campaign Trump promised to cancel #H1Bs!  Did Trump lie? We'll know soon.
DT screwed over illegal immigrants from Poland to build Trump Tower cheaply & now has foreigners on H-2B Visas working cheaply at Mar-a-Lago
Why not just pass the bill and ask him to sign it? Isn't that how Congress works?
Chuck we need #BanH1B and EB2.  Put America back to work!!! Fine Companies hiring greencard holders and make $$
What about the injustice to Merrick Garland? How do you look in the mirror?
Make sure we don't have any of those College Professors and Doctors at Vets admin terrorizing us. Thank you
#HireAmerican
not enough US trained new doctors to fill the needed positions here...
Med school is 4 years long, and need 8-9000 more grads to fill all available slots.
FYI 

 PwC is laying off hundreds of people in Tampa Florida to move those positions to Offshore TATA Consulting Services
Indian Minister says
US has told us no major change in H1B regime
I am glad to say that as regards the H1B visa for 2018.
Abasing yourself like a teen-ager stalking Justin Bieber is just sad. Sad and desperate.
Thank u for that. My sister had to train her replacement, then lost her job. Disgraceful
Eric Trump has applied for that Visa for Trump Winery
@trump4pres13 And Chuck where has this voice been for the last 10 years, do your job
thank you for bringing the 60 min story to Twitter attn.  This is currently happening in my fam
@DianaFry18 why does everyone think americans are educated enough to fill these jobs?not all are junk low wage jobs.
I hope so. Saw 1st hand how a friend employed by a tech co. trained his own replacement from India, then laid off. outrageous
@bwv_1001 Michelle Malkins broke this story! Thanks Michelle! You got this on the books!
u f'in joking? Trump uses nothing but, u think he's gonna let you change that? Work on something that matters,  impeach trump
and it only took you a couple of decades!
the moment you said Durbin, ya lost me
A year or two ago I recall Bill Gates pleading b4 congress 4 more H1b1 Visas. Requested. Microsoft laid off 17k US employees!
Unfortunately, foreigners will take less pay, which is why H1B1 Visas are so popular...less jobs for Americans, though! Sad.
We have seen this in the tech industry time and time again. My husband trained his replacement fr India then got laid off!!
Sir your bill s. 180 which prioritises Intl grads in US for h-1 makes the f-1 visa process a mockery without f-1 dual intent.
HIB workers are created by Congress to provide cheaper labor, they control the complete program
and make it illegal for employers to force laid-off US workers to train their Indian replacements or lose severance.
@BarbMuenchen I should hope so because this is wrong. Will any one bring up that Russia did Ukraine under Obama not Trump
Should have been done LONG AGO!!!!!!
@SenatorReid was SELLING THEM for $1/2 MILLION ,How Much did @HillaryClinton Receive , she had Harry BEAT UP not to TELL
it needs to stop today.
Start with Trump Organization.  They seem to LOVE using H1B Visa.
How can we 'fix' when Congress does not know how many H1B are already here? 100sof 1000sH1Bs here indef not6yrs via EB2I/EB3I
@realDonaldTrump Issue a moratorium for1yr. Direct USCIS to count H1B currently here.Only then can we determine best policy.
Fix loophole in AC21 Section 106a that allows USCIS/DOL to continue to put
Indian-born H1B (&F1) in line for EB2I/EB3I when no visa available for 15-50 yrs ( no one knows)
The loophole in your AC21 law allows 100s of 1000s H1B to stay indefinitely, not just 6yrs.
85k/yr NEW H1B # is disinformation put out to distract Americans fr reality of H1B.Tell us how many r here.
Before you allow any more H1B workers to come to US to work.
Drumpf uses them at his winery.
trump campaigned on this.  hold his feet to the fire & get this fixed, please
Why pick on and bully the H1B ? Have you even heard of L1, J1, O1 ?
Cmon, @ChuckGrassley - All we care about is Russia. #Russia #Russiagate #RussiaHearings
what will the trumps do for their employees then?
that is great news hopefully it passes without politic bias this needs to be done now. Thank you!
why r u talking like a teen? Brly udstnd u!
@PrincessBravato No one trust you!!!!!
which oligarch controls CBS?  How did this make it on the air?  For shame 60 minutes.  Go back to stories about whiskey.  Sad
Were you tweeting Trump to call you so you can leak info from Comey meeting? Asking for a friend.
60 Minutes report was flawed.  India companies/workers are stealing U.S. IT jobs, but they are working remote from India.
You have my support from CA. Perhaps the real question is why it took this long for someone to propose a fix. Lobbyists, no?
45 uses them for own businesses! Eric trump too for the vineyard!
I would suggest preserving #PellGrant funding as well. Industry will no doubt concur, we are not producing what they need.
you are still protecting illegitimate president. why do you ?
#WeThePeople Want @realDonaldTrump Impeached for Treasonous #TrumpRussia Businesses Span 4 Decades & #TrumpRussiaCollusion
CBS is fake news I was told
Tech companies ready to move jobs to country who want skilled workers like Canada. Where r US STEM Grad students 2 keep jobs?
Perhaps you should find farmers who can afford to pay the deplorable minimum wage?  Headcount now, who will work for farmers?
If I lived in Iowa, I would vote for you for fighting H1B abuse. Keep it going!
You're a little late - almost all my IT friends got shipped out in 2008
The program provides many of our doctors in rural areas.
Would your law apply to the current president's businesses, too? @ChuckGrassley
uh oh =Wow: Quinnipiac finds 64/30 for #Medicare55, 56/38 for #PublicOption
Your bill w/ Durbin doesn't go far enough. Min salary is too low & Indian companies will game the req to hire Americans 1st.
You probably lost your job because of incompetence.
that'll save meals on wheels? With u Pugs, we don't know OR TRUST anything anymore!
it offshore ! If you really care you should start fixing it ! Real talented people are waiting in line to start companies
force them to work for low wages ! They will fight for their right and will force employers to hire more American than send 3
There's no justification for sending 5.5MM American IT jobs offshore other than corp. greed.  $96B in Gov rev. lost per yr!
..chance by blocking the per country quotas bill ! If people waiting on GC line more than 10 years gets their GC no one can 2
Not enough.  We have to remove the loophole written into overseas sales requiring "offsets'.  Worse than H1B since we lose IP
what have you done to solve the problem till now ? Anyone can propose a bill or stop a bill ! You stopped the once chance 1
companies cannot survive without getting talent from all over the world ! Cut through BS if you actually wanted to fix it !
@POTUS $395B in wages & $96B of Gov tax revenue are lost annually from #H1Bs b/c they steer jobs offshore to India. #NoH1Bs
@JadedByPolitics well what took you so long
@Nordic_Saab95  Why was there a loophole in the law in the first place Senator? Now you're anxious to change it?
@Jhamaras2 Trump uses this program?????
@realDonaldTrump #MAGA #ImmigrationReform Hope 45 saw this tweet ment for him
Good!  Penalize the hell out of companies like DISNEY that pull this.
#stopH1Babuse Where have you been on this for the last 15 years?
It really sucks when your elected officials don't get back to you, doesn't it?  Oh well, get used to it. @ChuckGrassley
The best way to reform the #H1B visa program is to cancel it. US corporations should hire and train STEM grads not #H1Bs!
proposed loss of/increased premiums for health insurance, and loss of EPA/clean water and air.  Who are you representing?
How is it a "ripoff"? Maybe if more Americans became educated, there wouldn't be a need for skilled foreign workers.
so interesting how incensed you are by this and not by perjury of Attorney General, unethical Executive branch behavior,
Yes, the entire program need be shuttered. Stop them all CEO of India comp said plenty of US workers, dont need outsourced
^5 Get it done..American Workers...First
You are bad at twitter. This is illegible.
Thanx, but why did we have to wait since the 90's to fix this?
Shouldn't have  been passed in the 1st place
#HireAmericans... #AmericaFirst. America has more than enough QUALIFIED without having to go outside. #GiveItARest
@4US_Workers Will be watching! The companies fighting Trump's immigration EO are biggest abusers in WA State
really? b/c this isn't new. https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/us/last-task-after-layoff-at-disney-train-foreign-replacements.html …
How abt punishing the corps 4 exploiting?
H1B get a Lot of Highly Educated People who Help the Country and Work unlike You!
What is Wrong is You getting Paid to Do Nothing but go on Vacation Like Trump!
Say less
cool did you see the one about hundreds of thousands of people starving?
you do realize how many rural hospitals and clinics would and will be short of doctors without H1b don't you?
only 5% come as doctors in a year on h1b we can still have then come in a new visa only meant for medical
ok get that passed how about physicists and engineers and other grad students?
h1b reform is needed . Right now we have cheap labor replacing labor . Not skilled labor replacin non-skilled
Why isn't it getting passed rather than taking healthcare away from 24 million + Americans. #h1bvisa #Trumpcare
Where have you been the last 10 years?  Not a new issue.
The Russian ties don't mean amything. Have him release those tax returns
Injustice just last week @Manpower $MAN, 150 IT workers losing jobs to unethical Tata Consultancy H1B
here is the company @manpower is replacing its employees with. $MAN http://archive.jsonline.com/business/jury-awards-940-million-to-epic-systems-corp-in-trade-secrets-lawsuit-against-tat-consultancy-b99709-376114761.html …
Well, American tech workers have been waiting for years for this to happen. What's the hold up? #Shame
@POTUS Trump uses the H1B by the thousands. What kind of BS are you spreading?
Don't forget his shitty wineries. http://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/2016/12/23/trump-winery-under-fire-after-applying-for-visas-seeking-foreign-workers.html … Trump/GOP voters are such suckers.
@Sara_Tonyn @grandma_mickey @ChuckGrassley @POTUS Hires foreign workers & clothing lines outsourced but 45 says MAGA - lies
it's been going on for decades. It's about time!
Yes it has been going on for years
.@ChuckGrassley @All100Senators you want to kill the h1b visa program AND pell grants to prevent Americans frm qualifying 4 those jobs? Ace!
Good, because America come FIRST!
don't let Bill clinton get away with his Epstein island human trafficking crimes
???? You honestly didn't know this was going on? wow. It's about time Senator!
are you going to question why Nunes spoke about the witetap on Fox? U going to ask for a recusal? #TrumpRussia #TrumpProtest
You watch the news to learn this? then retweeted it? SERIOUSLY? You honestly didn't know this was going on? This is old news
This cannot happen quick enough!!! Starts with Pres who uses H1b for his business!
Our whole Immigration System needs a Major Overhaul.
It's happening in every Iowa Meat Packing Town. Refugees replace American workers. What are your thoughts?
Good.
