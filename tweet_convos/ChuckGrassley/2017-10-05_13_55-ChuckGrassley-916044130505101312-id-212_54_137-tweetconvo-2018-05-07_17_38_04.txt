Really disappointed in you.   You need to resign.

Someone needs to stand up to this President
And that is NOT going away.
Horrible tax deal, total lottery ticket for the rich...Ask Iowans they will tell you...also #steeleDossier shows what Sicko lil don is #Perv
cut healthcare and give your corporate masters a tax break? That's not how is should work.
You’re doing a Budget?  Why couldn’t you do something like that when you, instead, decided to cripple the Supreme Court?
You mean setting stage 2 gut Medicare/Medicaid and give tax cuts to the rich. Liar.
This budget is heartless and evil shame on you Senator.
Your hands are dirty in the Trump/Russis scandal.
Hey Chuck- could youB anymore obvious you are carrying water for Trump? A la Devin Nunes.  The Dossier has in LARGE parts bn proven Accurate
Iowa - did you know Trump personally intervened to make sure your health insurance was not repaired?
Iowa wanted to fix its health insurance marketplace. Trump found out and personally said no. By @Eilperin http://wapo.st/2xXYqFw?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.9266c7a9d8c4 …
Yep...cut the illegal funds to all obummer care
Nice work
you want to take away healthcare from the poor, give $$ for the rich, God hates you.
Does this sound like a judiciary committee matter to you? I, like you, have no law degree, but it does to me.

BS Trump haters McCain Collins Murkawski will vote no
So Putin wants to create chaos in the U.S. and is running cyber ops against us... have you even noticed?  Want details?
$100Billion for a Wall???.................No Healthcare for Usa Citizens!.............terrible,a sin!
That Steele Dossier is a beautiful thing :) #GOPcomplicit
And who is this tax bill/ cuts benefitting,@ChuckGrassley ? Your rich donars or those who actually need it?
TAX REFORM = TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY ONLY!!
Much of the Steele dossier is 100% VERIFIED! Possibly false salacious elements doesn’t mean throw it all out. #ImpeachTrump
Shameful, history is going to be very hard on you.
As before, GOP cuts taxes,federal debt spirals up until a Dem is elected. Clinton almost eliminated debt. Obama was lowering Bush debt. STOP

What are you doing about our 25th amendment issue?
When a US Senator namedGrassley is seeking2expose sources&methods byFBI 2PROTECT RUSSIA- it's time for Grassley to register under FARA
Why are you Obstructing Justice and trying to cover for corrupt Trump?
U R my Senator and I do not want a trade of Amnesty for Border Control. NO WAY !!!
Here is another example of the moron-in-chief is undercutting the ACA personally. Iowa waiver denied.
Tax cuts for the wealthy. We'll see if it's approved. And you may want to packing your office toys to take home for your imminent retirement
Chuck, plz lay off your objections about the  pee pee tape. 
If the dossier is true it will bear out. 
If not true then you have no worries.
Hey Chuck! What's ya worried about? Kinda soon to be worried about evidentiary issues, Komrade? Tic Toc
41 paid for the Dossier and it’s going to get used regardless if it takes down other Kremlin dipshits, hope you’re clean Chuckie.
WTF?!!! Your own staff says you're not even investigating RUSSIA?!!!  What have you been doing then?
Yeap....Trump's Tax Plan
#TrumpRussia

WTF, @GOP ???!!

Our PRESIDENCY was HIJACKED!!!

Senate ‘Russia Probe’ Is Not Investigating Russia
@GOP #TrumpRussia 

Oy!!
Hey corrupt old buzzard, when will you stop trying to cover for this egregious administration?
Patriotic Millionaires Don't Want Tax Cuts.  https://youtu.be/pYSRZ8fnKnw 
I paid in to Medicare since I was 15 years old.  Now when the baby boomers get to start using it, you want to cut it?  #BS
It sounds as if your work is merely oversight of the FBI in the Trump Investigation meanwhile we discover Kaspersky is FSB.
Can you request a breakdown of where Kaspersky is utilized in our Government so the United States can understand what we were up against in the 2016 election?
If they had kaspersky..they can crash trains..blow up power plants etc.
Are you guilty or is it just over and trump is guilty?
If Kaspersky was FSB...I want to know where and how it was used.
Which ELECTION Machinery was secured with this spyware?
and was cross check voter verification software hacked too chuck?
400 million computers zombie FSB machines
Bet you and your buddies are slobbering over the great tax breaks your giving the rich while sticking it to the poor.
Thanks for fighting for all Iowans 
Question: on Sept 7th debt ceiling was raised, on Sept 8th national debt increased by $318 billion. How did this happen in one day ?
Budgets?
By all means, Chuck, line your pockets, while hurting your constituents. Continue to do the bidding of your donors, and ignore our needs.
You are one of the FEW senators I respect.

And helps lobbyists and industry?
And the rich

Grassley staffer says the Judiciary Cmte isn't running a full Trump-Russia probe, just routine oversight of DOJ. https://www.thedailybeast.com/senate-russia-probe-is-not-really-investigating-russia-staffers-say …
This bill is the most IMMORAL piece of legislation that truly shows the GOP think hard working Americans are illiterate trash
Seriously?! I don't understand how you can gut healthcare for the poor to pay your rich buddies in form of tax relief
#shameful
benefit from. Millions of hard working Americans will end up paying MORE taxes while the richest & corps get TRILLIONS of $
TRILLIONS in CUTS to healthcare, Medicare, Medicaid ( which POTUS promised not to touch) &programs that hard working citizens
You're right!! It's ALL about huge tax cuts for the richest Americans & Corps at the expense of hard working Americans.
tax cuts for the exceedingly weathy you mean, right? #TaxTheRich never the middle class.
Didn’t u also include millions/billions? For the wall?  Just think how u could help many people instead of satisfying only trump.
Grassley is despicable! Budget approval that takes millions from Medicare and Medicaid. Allows Trump to let IA ACA fail. So shameful !
What are you going to do about this?
#checksandbalances
You work for Putin. You disrespect America and the FBI. We the people can't wait to see you voted out. 

#NoTraitors

FBI needs to be investigated for abuse of power, too! Fusion GPS was a KNOWN Democrat opposition slander firm, used to spy on Trump.

You're ok with Trump destroying people's health care in your state on purpose? Are your constituents ok with that?
And decimating Medicaid?
You need to research how many will be helped by the tax bill and how many hurt. The middle and lower class can't subsidize the wealthy.
Disappointed that you didn’t remove the tax cuts for the wealthy class.  Reagan did the same thing and the debt skyrocketed.
Chuck explain not germane and out of order!
History repeats! R’s vote down all D amendments! Just like D’s voted down all R amendments when their were in charge. childish behavior
We need true unity in Congress not gridlock.

Don't bet on it - you @GOP morons underestimate the power of @SenateDems, the few GOP senators that do care about people & #TheResistance
This is a wicked and cruel budget
The GOP “tax plan” is really increasing taxes on the poor and middle class, while making the rich richer - paid for by cutting healthcare!
Outrageous
....and the RICH get RICHER... @ChuckGrassley
This will be the final nail in GOP coffin! #Dems2018&2020
That's it.  Give tax cuts to the 1%.  #Kochsucker  #Mercernary
Explain this to your constituents
#BREAKING: Trump told top Health Department official to deny Iowa's request to fix ObamaCare market: report http://hill.cm/18XOQxC  
Grassley has dementia. He doesn't give a shit about his constituents.

These republican senators are complicit in treason & the American people will gladly see them spend the rest of their lives in prison
What is your tax reform going to do to the deficit, let alone working Iowans? You’re not so much of a deficit hawk anymore.
Brother Grassley do not fall into this budget trap that will ruin America
TaxCuts for Billionaires & Big Corp.'s on the backs of middle class/poor Tax Payers. Lies about it helping middle class. Russian collusion-Trump Jr.,Jared meetings.
Gotta kill off that expensive healthcare in order to free up the big bucks needed for tax "reform". It's not aimless cruelty. It's money.

This is what the 2018 budget/TaxReform proposals look like. 
More money for the 1%! Thanks for looking out for the mega rich, Chuckles! 
Code for tax cuts for rich tax hikes for middle class. #chucktaxley
You represent Iowa, correct? Release a statement concerning the impact of this on Iowans. http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/354170-trump-told-hhs-to-deny-request-to-fix-iowa-obamacare-market-report … @OttumwaCourier @NHTribune

Bipartisan was it?
Smile Senator, smile... Hell is fueling up for you.
“There’s money for HHS to fly around on private jets, but there’s not money and resources to do outreach in Mississippi.”
Trump and family and body guards over 500 million have been spent this year

So are you going to fight for IA health care,do you want it to explode like Trump. Your big $ donors want that, how bout people elected you
Great. Now stop discrediting Steele dossier, you know @FBI and @CIA corroborated it
You're just letting him do this? Or do you approve? Party over constituents, right? Party over country.

Trump/Russian sycophant
@FBI we can not let the Russian supporting racist misogynistic evil hypocritical hateful old men be in charge any longer. PLEASE bring them to their knees Mr Mueller!
My son is losing his health insurance Dec. 31.  Republicans have defunded ACA for years.  Do you have ideas how he will get insurance?
I hope all the rich people getting the cuts can afford their grey poupon.  You are embarrassing Iowa and yourself.
Senator Grassley - I want you to explain to your constituents about the cuts to Medicaid and Medicare and how that will impact Iowa.
Is this how President Trump helps Iowa?  http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/354170-trump-told-hhs-to-deny-request-to-fix-iowa-obamacare-market-report …  Do you people have a conscience?
.@ChuckGrassley You've been in Congress nearly my entire life (less ~8 months). But I'm certain you were an asshole long before I was born.
Hope you don’t take away Medicare or Medicaid and let the rich have the spoils of your war with average Americans.
Eventually people will catch on to the cruelty that is Republicanism.  Keep hurting us with your unfair bills and 2018 may be the end.
Loaded up with social cuts to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. Call for Trumps taxes Senator otherwise he's a liar. Circumventing regular order and 60 votes. Smarmy people swimming in the swamp occasionally coming out to sting working people.
Mueller Investigate this

Obama Spying on Trump

How will the country afford this tax exemption for the rich? SOB

Grassely really really wanted to talk with Steele and wanted to discredit dossier b4 it blows up in his face He's compromised
What is wrong with you?  This is America, NOT Russia.  You would have us starve and die with no health insurance-you are a wicked old man
DO NOT ATTEMPT ANY KOND OF TAX REFORM UNTIL WE SEE DONALD TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS FOR AT LEAST THE PAST 10 YEARS.
*KIND
DO NOT LOWER THE CORPORATE TAX RATE. WE DO NOT HAVE THE HIGHEST TAXES IN THE WORLD - NOWHERE CLOSE WHEN DEDUCTIONS ARE CONSIDERED.
DO NOT LOWER THE TOP TAX BRACKET TO 35%. IT BENEFITS PRIMARILY THE TOP 1%, WHO DON'T NEED TAX BREAKS AND MOST OF WHOM DON'T CREATE JOBS.
DO NOT RAISE THE LOWEST TAX BRACKET TO 12% - THAT HURTS WORKING CLASS.
DO NOT GET RID OF THE ESTATE TAX. IT DOES NOT HURT FAMILY FARMERS.
Robbing from the poor and our health care to pay for tax breaks for the rich. Bravo, Chuck.
What a JOKE you and the rest of your PARTY are! Some of the most ignorant people vote for you! Not all but a lot!
Oh, goody.   The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
I am sure it is real fair to the middle & poor in this country.  especially seniors & children & women.
Excellent. 
If your budget is anything like healthcare, tax reform or supporting the prez who has no concept of truth or the constitution it's a fail.
I’m good with it
Great work - thank you

We Do Not Need a Republican Tax Cut for the Rich!
So you are going to give your wealthy donors a big tax cut.  Surprise!  Shame on you.
We heard   headed out to sell plasma now so i can afford to help the rich   gop outbin 18
Senator, I noticed that your budget makes cuts to Medicare and Medicaid! You aren't going to support this? That would not be good for Iowa!
Monsters

The Top 1% get nearly 80% of the Trump tax cuts.  Top .1% get nearly 40% of the cuts. This is absurd. 
#MerrickGarland
#MAGA agenda Finally!
Not goodtaking billions from Medicare, Medicaid, education, social programs for poor!  Politicians once more not giving a shit!!!!
FANTASTIC, GOOD JOB, THANK YOU
Satan's copilot, Grassley, lies again and again about the damaging effects of this tax code, the NRA, healthcare and Citizens United.
Chuck speaks the truth and you claim he lies. You need to research the truth not opinions.
I do lots of research. Grassley does not tell the truth and I have repeatedly called him out on that. Get your info somewhere besides fox.
Hidden cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. What's next cutting Social Security so old can starve? You are a disgrace.
Stealing from the poor to give tax cuts to the rich. You think you'll get away with this? You won't.
Are you sure 80% of tax breaks to 1% is really supportable? What abt other 99%? You represent them too.
Medicare and Medicaid decimated and you celebrate this? Despicable.
Wealth inequality is out of control. We know your plan is to enrich the rich and enslave us further. The people see what you are doing.
Will the supposed savings go to pay down our $20 Trillion DEBT?????
What? You never heard of trickle down pee on the peons?
....and there's money in there for a wall that Mexico was paying for?
They want to cut medicaid, medicare and. Social Security all to pay for tax cuts.  GOP are greedy old men.
You are not right on your thinking.
Yes she is right

Biggest thing: first the GOP came for health care to pay for tax cut for the rich. Now it's tax cuts for rich, paid for by health care cuts.
Your legacy is in the toilet, Senator.
Oh boy, more money for people who don't need it.   What about Russia?
Well, I guess thanks for nothing! Please, please, please start thinking about the average citizen & their needs. #DoTheRightThing #IowaCries
Please don't.
Senator, the tax cuts will hurt the middle class. I can't pay more for health care and higher taxes at the same time.
Stealing medicare I worked and paid into Is there any thing you will not steal for your donors or Trump
Crook!!!
Does it rob from the poor & give to the rich?
It cuts Medicare and Medicaid!
First real numbers on Trump's tax plan: Multi-millionaires get more than $700,000 back. The poorest fifth gets $60.
And cuts Medicare and Medicaid so $60 isn't going far
Congress needs to get something done.
Will there ne hearings or do we take it on blind faith?
Hush!! Don't  let Chuck know I still have a dime in my pocket!!! #hefindsoutIwont
“Who cares about deficits now that we are in charge?”
“Those billionaires need a break. They’ve been working so hard”
That's great. Thanks for fucking over Americans not in top 1%. Good job. Give yourself a pat on the back. Resign.

This cuts Medicare and Medicaid 
Noooo, Chuck!
Repeal the dickie amendment. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickey_Amendment_(1996) …
