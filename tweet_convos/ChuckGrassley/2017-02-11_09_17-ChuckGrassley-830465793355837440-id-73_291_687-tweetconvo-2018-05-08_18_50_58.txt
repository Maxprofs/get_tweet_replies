Chuck thinks the WH monitors their Twitter.  LOL
45 fired the WH  under security guy, he was escorted out of WH and has disappeared
I did see that the other day. Waiting on them to blame all of the (ongoing) leaks on him.
Yes I agree. More disconcerting is the fact he's vanished. No tweets no FB post. Nothing
Well thats a little concerning.
Right?  I think maybe trumps private security are Putins thugs. And they "dealt" with him when he found out the truth
come on now don't go all "birther" probably something contractual
Really?  Contractual. He was escorted out of the WH. No one has heard from him since. No birthed BS. Just stating
Seriously, try the golf course at ML or cell phone as it is not protected. REleased his taxes yet. and Why not.
If you really want to get through to the White House you need to go through Putin.
They fired cyber security guy middle of the night. You GOP idiots are watching this authoritarian regime on brad day light
I think he was hacked
You're a dreamer Chuck, Secrets are Power
@jaketapper Donald Trump fired White House cybersecurity chief last week, hasn’t replaced him, and he’s vanished:
@ChuckGrassleyRude Whoever monitors Chuck Grassley tell him to get sober.
@StephenBannon
ChuckGrassley you need to.go home for sure.   Too old to be doing this stop now and go home.
STOP trying 2 save face all Iowans have seen where your allegiance lies, with the @GOP 45 is YOURS OWN HIM you wanted you got
.@ChuckGrassley you fired your aide on the Committee on Finance Chris Armstrong https://s3.amazonaws.com/khudes/Twitter9.15.15.pdf …
you were quoted in an article by @washingtonpost
@jaketapper hold hearings for Garland.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @KellyannePolls  WHY IS NO ONE ANSWERING CHUCK? He pretended to Tweet the WH all weekend
Cut the crap. Get off Twitter and do your job. You remind me of the orange one.
They sould take Your Twitter away at the Nursing Home!
obsess much senator?
Twitter is all that @realdonaldtrump knows, no one is monitoring. He's too dumb to be president so he plays propagandist.
Your Redmap gerrymandering is getting turning our country into corporatocracy/fascism. I was once republican - never again! @ChuckGrassley
have you been hacked? Or are you drunk tweeting?
Thanks Senator for standing up to Trump. A dangerous man
for our democracy.
#America doesn't follow your pathetic #Twitter account.
Are you delusional? @realDonaldTrump is a tyrant and needs to be fought at every turn, not sweet talked. #impeach
Again, not to be critical but you need to address a tweet ie @POTUS or only you and your followers see it. #amateurnight
.@ChuckGrassley Whoever monitors Twitter for Sen Grassley get on subject of listening to all constituents in Iowa. Tell him open 99 mtgs.
As an Iowa taxpayer I demand #TrumpTaxes and you request for review. # DoYourJob
@jaketapper and get his Tax Forms the Dog is trying to hide his Bones. Dig em up!!!
Maybe you could respond to the messages I left with YOUR staff instead of this embarrassing rant. Show Iowans some respect!
ok, this is weird lol wtf?!
you've made me angry lately. Get Trump to release his taxes and investigate Russia, we might be good again
Maybe this is proof that *45 should not be allowed to use Twitter. Maybe now @jack will remove @realDonaldTrump Danger to US

@jaketapper Senator, you expect a guy who has plastic cover windows to block press to declassify?
@jaketapper Are you saying @POTUS is ignoring you calls and letters? Or just a vague tweet?
@jaketapper Now I know you're drunk.
@jaketapper Os this the so-called Senator or actually a man serving the nation?
@jaketapper done with your daily #DairyQueen ?
@jaketapper obviously hacked. The senator is too busy cowering under his desk to take on his Obama roll-back gravy train.
since we now know Flynn was talking business to the Russians beforehand, and of course Trump knew, ?impeach
Are you referring to the guy you endorsed who won't honor his promise to release his tax returns?
And DeVos , Sessions, Wouldn't give a hearing for obamas Supreme Court pick? You're past being  believed.
T et al will go down. History unfolding now. WP, CNN, all over this HUGE story. Keep up pressure, Sir.
Oversite committee and Shiff on it to. Watching closely from VT
I like you, @ChuckGrassley, but you should learn how twitter works.
Pretty sure the Twitter guy isn't the guy you need to check this out. Maybe contact your senator?
I'm thinking this is why we must save the #ACA
What are you talking about Senator. Why don't you just call President Trump. Rather odd tweet for you <?>
Hey Chuck - sucks when you are reduced to tweeting at someone who should be engaging in convo with you, doesn't it??
Ding! One person awake at the helm. @SenateGOP Do. Your. Job.
why don't you reply to him directly in a tweet so that he sees it? @realDonaldTrump
Twitter, how does it work?
Thanks for addressing but the cow is already out of the barn. Need to see action.
when will you be in Iowa to talk to your constituents?
DECLASSIFY THE RUSSIAN PEE PEE TAPES!
The typical CNN viewer.
If only you were part of a gov't branch that could oversee the executive
Sounds like a great way to hide abuse.
3 weeks into the new administration & it's not 100% perfect -- goodness gracious.
Has your account been hacked? I can't figure out what your last two tweets mean.
His tweets me he can't get in touch with @POTUS and has decided to take it to twitter
oh my. This is a US Senator.
are you? better question
more of this, Senator! Iowans want you to keep @realDonaldTrump accountable #iapolitics
he IS drunk tweeting.
