ummmm...
Now I know why y'all in your committees are saying you don't have the tech knowledge to thoroughly investigate #russiagate 
Uh, we want you to investigate trump-Russia ties. Nothing else until we know if we have been sold out.
@LouiseMensch @POTUS Yea, there's another message here for sure
poor Chuck....
Call Rebekah Mercer, she'll help put you in touch with the president.
Maybe you should ask Fox and Friends to read your tweet on the air? Then @realDonaldTrump may respond.
Why don't we see the same enthusiasm in investigating Russian connection?
This seems like the kind of thing that you maybe shouldnâ€™t be tweeting publicly about? But what the fuck do I know?
@LouiseMensch @POTUS really weird to put "who she is" in all caps. Why?
@LouiseMensch @POTUS WHO IS SHE Chuckie?  #trumprussia #trumpdossier #russiagate #resist #trumpleaks @SenFeinstein
why the caps, senator?
Because it's a SHE.  This is called "luring the president".  That poor staffer is bait!
is this the usual manner in which you communicate with potus? Where's the love?
@LouiseMensch @POTUS wth
@LouiseMensch @POTUS Are U sending signals again Chuckie? U trying to obstruct justice? Can go to JAIL for that ya? #resist
@LouiseMensch @POTUS Our government is a comedy! I'm actually almost in tears from laughter
@hannahyeggy @POTUS this is NOT real
oh but it IS
Senators being reduced to publicly tweeting the president on private business nowadays?
first stop fuming venom on h1bs n their families on daily basis, u think all jobs are gone coz of h1b program?
@LouiseMensch @POTUS What? I do appreciate transparency so thanks. (I think)
Sir; might I suggest you try the President by using his @realDonaldTrump account on his ancient cell phone?
Chuck, I suggest you approach @POTUS in his milieu so he doesn't have to leave his comfort zone. Do you play golf?
Why is Trump using foreign labor at his FL resort?
Chuckles, how can anyone who droned thru ur off. be deemed expert on anything bt party line drooling?
@thegarance @POTUS Can't get him on the phone Chuck? Or do they keep putting you through to President Bannon?
@LouiseMensch Iowa, former bastion of sane moderate midwesterners, now the Arizona of the region. Not a compliment. Sad!
Chuck, you know what has to be done. He has to go. Pence will sign all of the legislation you want.
I hear Hillary's available. I think #DonTheCon is busy picking up random women & taking them 2 Mar a Lago. True story
If there's a god, yelling "WHO SHE IS" will become a meme. 

It's only Chuck Grassley tho so prob not.
not quite, but close enough:
Another play for pay by a Senator???
@LouiseMensch @POTUS Sounds like an important position no womend allowed Chuckles.
Wut
@LouiseMensch @POTUS wtf
Hey Don, I think Chuck's trying to out-buffoon you. Tall order - you gonna take this sitting down?
@LouiseMensch @POTUS Key words: mine, moved, homeland security, SHE
please notice me senpai
what's the secret that you have to tell traitor trump ...
how much money is trump got g to steal from US to pay for his Russian debt
Is this some sort of code 2 give him a heads up about what you learned in Comey mtg that turned U ashen?
Holy batcave, is this for real? Doesn't anyone help this guy out.  You are on twitter, you are not sending an IM
did someone get hacked? Or do you not know how to use twitter?
#H1Bs r used by corps. to lower their cost of labor but they devastate US workers, cause lower wages & hurt families!
H1B program is easy to fix, cancel it. US corps. should hire & train STEM grads and not rely on #H1Bs.
It's a DISASTER. Please suspend it!!! That would be a great achievement and help for Americans!
@KateNocera @POTUS chuck? You cray cray?
Was he so shaken by the Comey briefing that he's thinking nothing he does matters anymore?
@crushingbort @POTUS TELL US WHO SHE IS
Please don't give the names of unsuspecting female staffers to the Rapist-in-chief, Chuck.
Mr. President, my balls are experts in providing therapeutic healthcare. I invite you to suck on them.
you really should retire @POTUS
Sen Grassley is making very public point, and it isn't good for Trump. As McLuhan said: "The medium is the message."
Hmmm. Maybe he knows something....

Is this the beginnings of retreat?
If she didn't work at Goldman Sachs, it's a no go.
Chuck dont read this..

..former staffer, hello
Seasoned senator reduced to tweeting @POTUS. Jesus, you've fallen a long way. Won't the Orange One take your calls?
@thegarance @POTUS If she's not on Fox & Friends he's not interested
@thegarance @POTUS He's probably still golfing.
Seasoned senator reduced to tweeting @POTUS. Jesus, you've fallen a long way. Won't the Orange One take your calls?
@KateNocera @POTUS is this really happening???
@OwenColby this is a real senator's real twitter feed
@MaryHartmanx2 @POTUS while investigating Russian and Trump I'm not sure offering him staff is a good idea js
u mad chuck?
@JoePerticone @POTUS sounds like you're tired of WH staffing unfilled positions with their lackeys instead of  professionals!
You can tell me Chuck I'll keep it a secret
this seems like something you should've emailed about
@JoePerticone @POTUS Senator, I am pretty sure Bannon or Kushner would take your call.
@libbycwatson @POTUS are y'all gonna go to dairy queen for u know what?
PUTS POS
@libbycwatson lmao this is such a good tweet
