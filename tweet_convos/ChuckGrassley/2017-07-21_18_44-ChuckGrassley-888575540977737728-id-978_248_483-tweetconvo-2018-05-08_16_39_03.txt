You are arrogant and condescending. Power has paid you a visit and you've embraced it.
I think you might want to start listening to WE THE PEOPLE. FYI...there is no #loyalty to the President its loyalty to your country #Traitor
How do you sleep at night ??? The people will not forget your betrayal to this country.
What part of Iowa do you live in Mary?
Which corner of your mom's basement do you live in?
And as I told someone else, since Mr. Grassley actually IS my senator, who is the real troll here?
I actually called Mary out. If she isn't from Iowa, how do you threaten Iowa's senator?
Should be public.  We are the people and we want to here.  Shame on you and the committee for not making it public.
On a record only Congressional committee members will have access to, right?! Appears you haven't noticed folks are losing all faith in /1/
those elected to serve the people. Constant lies and 1/2 truths! Ignore Jr & Manafort's attorneys, subpeona them under oath in public /2/
if they refuse - then contempt of Congress against all with full penalities enforced. Enough games & shade of gray political 'drug deals'.
I don't understand why it isn't going to be public.
they are all Republicans! They drug Hillary in there for 17 hours to testify. Little more lenient when it seems to be one of their own
Why are you impeding the investigation of traitors?
Why are you so sure the real traitors aren't being investigated too?
Not holding a public hearing under oath makes you & the rest of the committee look like sell outs. What did they promise you?
Heard Gowdy was ~ acting as Don Jr's lawyer. Nice touch.Why are you screwing around canceling his testimony? Running INTERFERENCE for Trump?
You sir are damaging faith in our democratic institutions . Wheres your spine to stand up vs Trump administration abuse of power ?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTdrDsDhl-U â€¦ But we let Obamas Admin. Get away with everything.
Untrue
Stop acting like you don't understand. Show that you are there to represent the people of Iowa. Show some integrity.
The one thing that is transparent with you is your disregard for the citizens of this country.
America deserves the truth in a public setting. If he can go on television and lie to the world then he can testify in a public hearing.
Then we need to get Obama, Clinton and Rice on the stand first, wouldn't you say?
Troll.
Considering Mr. Grassley actually IS my senator, who is the real troll here?
Sen Grassley is making decisions and arranging hearings that effect all Americans.This discussion has nothing to do with Obama, Clinton,Rice
It has everything to do with them. Russia tampered with our election, yes.
To get Hillary elected because she was beneficial to them
You would have to be smoking crack to believe that or drinking the kool-aid. Putin hates Hillary. The emails to Jr prove you wrong on that.
Why does he hate the woman who gave him control of 20% of our uranium, again?
When I look at you I see someone not to be trusted in any way. You are a hypocrite and have been bought.
On record somewhere, closed to the public, not under oath. Trust us he says, we'll get to the bottom of this.
Anyone else would have been put under oath. Who are you protecting @ChuckGrassley?
You are as fixated on what CNN is reporting instead of fixating on what Trump, his family, & his cronies have done & doing to this country
Wow! Junior hires Karina Lynch who worked for @ChuckGrassley and magically, Public Hearing is cancelled. #CoverUp
Make it public! Stop protecting them!
Soooooooo many traitors. Don't worry Charles you will be voted out. #DumpTrump
So put it on the record. No confusion then.
Where's the record if Rice's testimony??? Republicans are so weak.
Really....that is convenient. We want more details..do tell...
.@ChuckGrassley we not only wants to hear directly from Manafort, Trump Jr, & Kushner-we also want to see & hear questioners. #2018 #2020
SHAME!!! #complicit
We want to watch him! We want to watch him! Where is the transparency
The public deserves to see and hear the testimony! If they have nothing to hide they shouldn't mind public testimony.
Great point! Why is Susan rice and others from Obama administration all closed doors!
I don't know PROBABLY because they spoke with Rice & Burr said Nunes made the entire thing up. The @GOP will be exposed.
Let's hope the eventually will be exposed!
Under oath? Why do he & Manafort get to decide what they will do /which docs they'll give? You subpoenaed Fusion & let them do differently.
If you followed the news a bit more closely, you would know that Fusion GPS was invited to testify and refused. Trump camp are cooperating.
If you followed the news more closely, you'd know M & Jr replied today, right before subpoena deadline.

Cooperating is testifying publicly.
Doubt they set their own parameters. But it all out in the open 100%. None s/be closed. Btw, Simpson said he'd take the 5th. Why do u think?
I'm not defending him, I'm asking why dbl standard. Private meet doesn't=in the open. They were told X or subpoena & now, ok, do Y instead.
Why Trumps being investigated at all?  Clapper, Brennan, Fienstein, all stated NO EVIDENCE of collusion.  No US Intel looked at DNC server.
Brennan:"I saw interaction that in my mind raised questions of whether it was collusion."
Clapper:
& DNC server is *far* from the only piece. Furthermore, per Comey, they got everything they needed from the IT company that saw the server.
What happened to Susan Rice testimony? Dossier testimony? Why is that taking so long and @DonaldJTrumpJr is instant?
When u have nothing to hide u shout it...when u do like Rice Clinton Fusion et. Al. You stall. These ppl didn't say shit about rice today
As someone in his area I can honestly say that he has no spine whatsoever. This was all a false display to cover for them.
Same here. I'm also a constituent of his. He's shameless and cares not a whit for the average American.
Run against him!! Work towards getting him out. He's hurting our country.
My closets are overflowing with skeletons--I'm not a good candidate. lol
Is the record available to the public? Stop covering up for this Mafioso family!
Well....
You buckled and let us all down- thanks for nothing Chuck- we'll remember this
Chuck you are replacing the traditions of America with those of North Korea - put country before the Trumps you dishonest immoral politician
Are "CLOSED" session records open for scrutiny? Or only by SPINELESS Attendees? Only by sweeping Re-Elections Can This Be CURED.
But why go to such lengths to protect these people?

We see right through your dishonest immoral games Chuck - you should be ashamed 
By keeping this behind closed doors you may as well admit that every election from here on is compromised. That it's okay for China to hack.
Oh, now you are the attack dog for http://DT.Wow ,McCain would not agree with your actions.Why Pick on CNN,another attack dog.
On the record...under oath?
Why not leak testimony about Susan Rice & her 50+ "pleads the Fifth" don't listen to all the peps that did not vote in Ur stateI DID
Investigate Special Procecutors conflict of interests.V/ Comey & V/ Clinton.Why SP's office is 98.3% contribs to #hillarywhy only .7% else
PUT THEM UNDER OATH otherwise what's the point?
The sec of state hilliary clinton testifed for 11 hours public hearing kushner behind close doors not under oath outragous!
Why are you protecting kushner? And not under oath but fusion gps public hearing remember country over party right?
That's what worries you?
What's really not clear is this tweet and the one preceding it. Jesus Christ get your info straight
They were very clear that's what they said
And what is the reason that you can't demand public testimony?
What are you trying to hide, Chuck?
It needs to be in public! Why isn't? What are you guys hiding????
Why can't we watch them squirm? Please don't aid and abet #RussiaGate
Public record? Shady af
Why not public? Why did you give in? Who are you protecting? Why don't you work for us like you're supposed to?
There's nothing clear about it. You take a deal with them so that they won't be under oath. You start Tweeting how that's totally fine...
What is he reason it is not public?
It was completely clear! Jr. Trump said he would testify UNDER OATH. So why isn't he?  Stand up now or you will be remembered as a traitor.
GEE!!!  WHEN IS CNN EVER CLEAR ON A POINT INVOLVING PRESIDENT TRUMP OR HIS FAMILY!!
encouraging to see a prominent senator call them out for bs
Yep!
Why isn't it under oath? What's the point?
Why don't u watch CNN a little less and go your damn job . Why has FBI not answers for dossier , lynch Comey leak not investigated?rhino
This is a joke. I wish the GOP would take our national security seriously. Ridiculous. Why provide him cover? He said he would go under oath
Let's call it what it is, a casual lunch date because you will do nothing but throw softball questions & divert attention to HRC.
Bull! You're allowing @DonaldJTrumpJr to lie straight to your face because he knows you will not nor do you intend to defend America
Whose record.  Do it publicly.  You craven sycophantic slime ball.   Benghazi was done publicly and this is many times worse.
It would have been more enlightening to the people if it was public...like YOU said it would be.
Why did you cancel the other 2 interviews you had scheduled? Looks like you're trying to delay and undermine the Trump/Russia investigation.
How does DT Jr' attorney get away with making him available for testimony for only 2 hours?  Is it normal?
Retire. You @GOP sellout. 
#TrumpRussia #conspiracy #trumptanic
Will you release transcripts? #transparency
But now you trust them to be honest behind closed doors??
The bullshittery with these Republicans is astounding.
Confirms CNN reporting that Manafort and Trump Jr will not be under oath when they testify behind closed doors....Disgraceful!
Maybe someone will leak details? Enquiring minds want to know!!  Russia you will be greatly rewarded by our American press oops already said
You are protecting them!
You have chosen them over the country you took an oath to serve.

You
Are
Part
Of
The
Problem

Change that. 
Grassley, you're lying. You've been paid to advance the agenda of the billionaires who bought your party, and to protect the Trump cartel.
But not under oath...why not?
To be clear, you won't put him under oath, so it won't actually be "testimony," right?
@terib3294 Uh Chuck, when exactly has @CNN been clear on much of anything?
Was this your unilateral decision? Public wants a open hearing under oath.
Oh good, and we can look forward to you doing exactly what you did when at least two people have lied to you so far: NOTHING.
Your behavior indicates a need to investigate your Russia connections. #Makarov #dirtyrussianmoney
RETIRE!!!!!
ChuckGrassley is showing his true colors. Blind devotion to a Manchurian president and self interest over country. A disgrace to the #USA.
These men have conspired with a foreign power to undermine our democracy. What the fuck is wrong with you?!
On the record and under oath are totally different...not sure @DonaldJTrumpJr knows how to tell the truth until it is pushed in his face.
So it's like a Fox News interview?
If it's a crime to lie to Congress w/o an oath, why do we get folks to take one, & is Jr & Manafort's closed door testimony ltd to 2 hrs?
Why not make it public? What are you all trying to hide? We deserve transparency. Too many unanswered questions, you all can't be trusted.
Why the flip? I just read your tweet of open session @CNN @jaketapper
@DonaldJTrumpJr WILL NOT B TESTIFYING UNDER OATH?!  You DO know he's a Trump, right?  @realDonaldTrump  #TrumpCrimeFamily
Chuck - hold their feet to the fire.  No special favors or expect to see We the People at your door with torches and pitchforks.
Stop lying Jr won't be under oath  and no transcripts will become public
Does on the record mean under oath?
Not exactly   If it is on the record  yu can be questioned about it under oath
But not under oath?  Why not under oath?  That's wrong!!!
Not public and not under oath as far as I've heard. Weak!
Manafort and Donald Jr. were going to testify under oath in a public hearing. I'm losing faith in your committee. US people demand this.
trump & manafort won't testify under oath? Seriously? Then why bother? You duplicitous trump collaborator. You're colluding!
Senator, Don Jr. And Manafort MUST be under oath, why not?  What are you hiding from American people? .@ChuckGrassley
This testimony is useless unless Under Oath. You sir are obstructing the investigation#Treasonweasel
Why @ChuckGrassley not under oath? Why not in public? We deserve an explanation!
Why won't it be public? Are you complicit in covering up treasonous acts and behavior? The we deserve to know the truth from him, publicly.
Im disgusted by you- America is disgusted by you! Be ashamed Chuck because your days are numbered!!
You're another one who will go down badly in the history books. They will say that when our republic faced it's greatest test you failed.
They should be under oath, questioned in a public hearing.
Not clear because you are not being honest or forthcoming- too busy trying to spin blame away from guilty trumps.  Get the crooks out!
This does nothing to restore public confidence in our democratic system. Why a private hearing? #Accountability
Or, perhaps, you don't have the mental capacity to understand.
Quit protecting the Thugs in WH. Our democracy is at stake. Think the people not the party. Testify to the public.
Call every one from traitorous Obama administration in to find out how they screwed America
We need to start investigating GRASSLEY, I am not sure he actually works for the people anymore- he forgets WE write his paycheck
Why hide it? Why are you being soft on these 2 fools? Are you in on this as well? If so, you're a #Traitor, nothing more
It's shameful @ChuckGrassley if evil whispers influenced you constitutional duties.
Why did u once again cave in 2 pressure from @POTUS 2 protect the lying kid of a traitor. What r u covering up? Be an American, do ur job.
So disappointed that you have been wound around Manafort's finger. I had faith in some R conscience and courage, sad it was obv misplaced.
I WAS a Republican! No more! I am so so embarrassed & DISGUSTED with the Republican party. I hope & pray God punishes u 4 ur EVIL deeds! SAD
So now colluding with Trump and Russia.  Makes you just as much a traitor as Trump. What are they paying you ?!!
http://www.worldpress.org/article.cfm/senate-seats-up-for-reelection-in-2018 â€¦

What a joke! How much more hidden abuse r u & the republicans going 2 put the country through. The republicans has disgraced our country.SAD
Too who a bunch of partisan hacks , your no better then trump party over people is all u reptards care about
When are ya all gonna bring in DNC, Hillary, Obama administration on corruption, treason and real collusion with Russia?
Ridiculous! Trump Jr. & Manafort should be testifying under oath in an open session. Who are u protecting @ChuckGrassley? Not Americans.
Country before party 
Or did you forget?
Loyalty to the "president" is NOT patriotism to your country.
Could you please explain why Trump would need to pardon himself if he is innocent?
You are a sell out and a traitor to the American people.
So then we'll be able to get a transcript of "the record"?
Why isn't it in public Chuck? What are you hiding or afraid of? I  smell something fishy about the whole deal. Come clean. America deserves
better from you and the rest of Congress. This is no time for hide and seek. We will find out, better to come clean now.
You better smarten up Chuck. Anyone believing the Trumps at all are going to be treated like a fool when the dust settles.
Public! Full transparency.
The weak Comrade Grassley is severely compromised by #Trump regime....  Investigation underway..

@ChuckGrassley #Iowa #TrumpRussia #Impeach
Grassley is so non tech savvy he thinks Trump still has a lot of supporters based upon his Paid Russian Twitter accts liking his tweets.
Let Manafort and Jr. testify under oath in PUBLIC and take the 5th Amendment should they choose to. Anything less is an insult to Americans.
You are a traitor!  I was a Republilcan all my voting  life until Trump!  You people will NOT get away witlh your cover-ups!
WE DESERVE TO KNOW AND WATCH!  THIS IS SICK, AND OBSRUCTION BY THE REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS!!!!!
How did @CNN @CBSNews @ABCWorldNews @MSNBC @NBCNews @NPR @CNBC @abcnews Bypass Clinton and Obama Murders of Americans for this BS??!!!
Let's be clear on it all. The American people(remember us?) deserve the truth. Most already know that this corrupt family colluded. #truth
Even the FBI Director nominee says such contacts should be reported to FBI not encouraged
You are doing a great disservice to the American people. This should be public and transparent.
Another case of "watch what they do, not what they say". Am I right Senator?
What are you up to? Remember your in your position to work for the country! Not your party or this criminal president! Do your damn job!
muller cleared mana & jr to testify in public. neither held security clearances, kushner has. no logical reason not see mana & jr in public.
Sham!! You need to lose your job. Why bother if not under oath? All Americans know their all a bunch of liars and you're enabling them.!
Why not public???? Who made that decision?
It is disgusting that the testimony will be closed.
Will it be on oath?
Why not public? Who is the GOP protecting?
Under oath?
And under oath?
This is unfortunate in that us Americans really need to know/see what these people are doing
Why did you pre-empt their testimony with a witch hunt for the dossier? You're more transparent than Jello-Obstruction of Justice in senate!
Why private ? What's he got to hide?
STOP PROMOTING CONSPIRACY THEORIES! STICK TO THE FACTS! DONALD JR AND MANAFORT SHOULD TESTIFY IN PUBLIC UNDER OATH!!
What are you afraid of?  Why not make it public so that Americans learn the truth?
And if they lie under oath?  What then?  Does anyone prosecute that kind of stuff anymore?
And if not, does this set a precedent for us little folk should we ever find ourselves required to give testimony?
#Putin #PROPAGANDIST @ChuckGrassley subverts democracy to mislead America. Do Ur job! Make @PaulManafort @DonaldJTrumpJr testimony public!
So, what you're saying is that it is a step up from hanging out at Trump steakhouse and shooting the breeze. Good to know.
You literally said in your previous Tweet that they "also will appear openly". You were the one who was not clear on that point.
You are as complicit as the Trump family.
On the record isn't good enough. We have a RIGHT to watch their expressions & manner to judge veracity and context for ourselves. #PUBLIC
The rules the media has been forgotten. It has gotten crazy with all the fake news. Why doesn't the FCC step in like they used to?
Why not public? They were campaign members not apart of government. Nothing classified!
The public likes to start w/ PUBLIC testimony, then tell us WHY certain Qs need to be answered under oath but in private.

Got it?
democracy
Public hearing, under oath. Anything less is crap.
You mean @CNN gave false narrative again?
Right? We're shocked! 
Will you subpoena Jeb Bush?
America deserves to see these traitors publicly questioned. Enough of this behind closed door crap.
Stop making excuses! We want to see them testify so we the public can know what was said exactly. We don't trust you!
We were expecting a public hearing as Don Jr said he would! You're eroding public trust & democracy! Shame on you!
Why behind closed doors? You're complicit to their cover-up!

How many horses have kicked you in the head?
Are you serious?!?!?!!!!? The American ppl DESERVE to have an open hearing! Disgusting.

He doesn't need to say anything. That should be your counsel
Letting man who hijacked ur party bring GOP to its knees. Stand up and b the party u used to b. Show America U stand 4 them not Russia!
How many $$$ did it take for you to obstruct the Traitor Trials?
