I never understand your tweets
Haha you actually think he's going to do something constructive instead of golf and leer at women like a sleazy stalking creep?
Pay no heed to the trolls sir. Please push the fusion gps investigation. Something is amiss with this co
36%. That's what you got on your side of the fence. I would pay heed to the 64% on the other side.
Is that from your abc poll that over sampled Dems by 12% and cherry picks the 'independents' they call? Get lost troll
And if you have proof on "over-sampling Dems by 12% I'd love to see it (you don't)
Posted the link to senator grassley gov website and u can read the doc itself. It's coming soon. Fusion is dirty and framed trump jr
Framed? He released his own emails on twitter showing exactly how he was involved.
Frame job false claim of info to get mtg and make him look bad for fisa warrant
Right. Sounds complicated. Did Alex Jones tell you that?
Well since nothing's gotten done before Labor Day why should we think it will get done after.
How can u defend this prez?  Dint vote for the healthcare bill. It's a disaster. Your vote condones throwing 23 mill people off rolls.
retire, both of you.
Relax, Chuck-@realDonaldTrump will be in the Oval Office completing detailed policy work & building bipartisan coalitions...
Failed Predidency. No leguslative accomplishments. No wall, no heakthcare, no tax reform. Trump is mr empty pants
How dare u insinuate you're acting on behalf of people. This country is a mess becuz of republicans in power. Iowans have been too nice 2 u
He's made so many mistakes already, Russia, Health care, he the biggest loser of a POTUS in history
Why aren't you questioning the Russia meeting? My father's GOP would never have stood for such dangerous, unAmerican behavior.
He has golf and fire trucks to play with. He's clearly swamped.
Tax reform, repeal ObamaDeath, build the freaking wall -- rinse,repeat
I'm not blaming you but all of u stay there and work for the people.
I don't believe POTUS ever takes a vacation! Unlike Obama and his 3 week luxury vacations. Obama never really worked!
I agree, but I don't think taking off anytime is in his DNA!
He has no policy.
Sorry, Chuck. No Trump golf course in your state. See you in September.
America 1st Trump lies again.  Trump administration adds more foreign guest worker visas http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-worker-visas_us_596cd174e4b03389bb1938c6?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004 … via @HuffPostPol
What & give up golfing? But dont worry 1 of your lackeys will likely have a pen on hand if u ineffective, incompetent self serving pols vote
You must be thinking of Bush (& @GOP congress). Obama did not take August off.
@ChuckGrassley Stand w/ @POTUS he wants to do so much 4 ppl. Economy jobs enforce laws. We know Dems Soros twist stories 2 make worst. #MAGA
If I were you I'd focus on impeachment. Trump is killing ur party. Did you dedicate your life to serving ur country for Trump to destroy it?
Not gonna happen, Chuck, unless it's a campaign rally. He'd also have to develop some policies first.
Plus @POTUS works harder then any other president for sure
Sure Chuck. As if their are any priorities other than pleasing Russia, removing sanctions, enriching themselves & staying out of prison.
I hope you ask HRC and the former president To testify about R collusion as well as others instead of making a big deal about DTJR  let's go
Pretty sure the wheels have come off this POTUS
Get gov't out of healthcare, they are making everything worse. Nothing but higher taxes, worse care, & needless regulation driving up costs!
Who would notice? He never works anyway. Go golfing donald
Current GOP policies are demonstrably unpopular with most of the country. Get with the program. Holding Cong and WH is not a mandate.
Maybe you should take the month of august and try being a US Senator.
I agree. But you don't make same mistake and delay getting conservative judges in while you have a President and Congress majority.
Treasonous!
Maybe month if August should be when they finally admit what is going on woth the trasinous family in the White House.
So NO to repealing ACA healthcare
Do these idiots not know you speak regularly with @realDonaldTrump? This post is to hammer your point home.
Timeline Of Trump And Russia In Mid-2016: A Series Of Coincidences Or Something More?
Love the trolls
Resign.
Grassley you and the rest of the Republicans  need replacing, U do nothing but bend to the Dems. who are playing you guy's  like a fiddle
The wusses in both houses should stop these stupid time consuming hearings and do what the people put U there to do! Trump' s agenda is ours

Great advice @realDonaldTrump
he going to do what he wants
Whoa haooo! Mr President!! Look at me! I tried to call! Is your phone off? You didn't change your number? I must of lost it!
The fallacy here is --- Trump has yet to START working
Trumps presidency - more tweets than policy, more golf than legislation. All fizz no gin
Three words Chuck: Russia, Russia and Russia. That's your summer itinerary. Run. Run fast. Run NOW.
Wrong advice,  go golfing.
 when @realDonaldTrump stops taking your calls
Golf.
May be he should barnstorm with his lawyers. He is gonna need them
He'll be golfing full time, instead of just half of the time.
Lots of angry commenters, get over the fact you lost and move on. Unhealthy to keep throwing conspiracy theories all day everyday.
He's too stupid to understand these policies let alone explain them.
Thank you presidential historian and farmer Mr. Grassley, who are indeed wise and correct but it won't happen
My 2 year old Granddaughter can wright a Better Tweet!
And she does not get Paid Big $ to sit in 
Office and Tweet & watch TV to see what is on History Channel!
He's a traitor
There's no Trump golf courses in America's heartland though, so uh, not gonna happen
Yes, @POTUS should hold townhalls 
Which priorities Chuck? The plan to collapse our government or handing Putin the nuclear codes or destroying all that makes our country good
By barnstorm I assume you mean (a) golf regularly at a gold-plated resort and (b) rage ag cable news on twitter? That's all we will get.
How about telling him to not lie abt colluding with #Russia to steal an election? Or to stop promoting his businesses on Twitter? #DoYourJob
won't happen, golf is much more important
@jmartNYT @realDonaldTrump DJT is incapable of talking policy much less selling it.
Oh, don't worry Chuck. Trump isn't taking any time off. 100% dedication to his golf courses and misc properties. #grifter

No vacation for Pres. Trump. He'll be busy spending quality time with his lawyers.
Kinda pathetic u have to resort to twitter to communicate w/the POTUS, but I'm sure everything is normal & nothing to see here. 
It's pathetic. Not the first time Grassley has had to try to get POTUS attention on Twitter. Trump's presidency serves Trump only.
Praying Mr Grassley and rest of Congress take own sound advice. Praying same also choose to punt filibuster rules for sake of saving USA @VP
You mean go on a lying marathon? Chuckles, your peeps are hiding from their constituents. The GOP is dying on your watch. #hijackedbyfools
How about he just resign and let a more competent person run things, like Pence?
Yes! Definitely!

Healthcare Priority - 23 million LOSE their healthcare! Yay!

Tax "Priority" - MASSIVE tax cuts for top 1%! Awesome!
chuck you forget he doesn't work much? your idea would interfere with his tv-watching schedule and self-promotional golf outings. pass.
Good luck with that. Lots of golf to play in August. Plus , he's tired.
He's too busy watching cable TV and playing golf.

Priorities.
I'm pretty sure being president is trump's retirement hobby
So you mean golf more?
Don't have to tell Trump.  Tell your colleagues.  #Sad

1/ I haven’t tweeted much about healthcare because it’s a painful subject for me. But it’s important, so let me tell you my story
