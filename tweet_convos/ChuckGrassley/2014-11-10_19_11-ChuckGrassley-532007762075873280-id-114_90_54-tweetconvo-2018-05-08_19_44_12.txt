@ChuckGrassley @nsaidian .close?
@ChuckGrassley GOP Congress has abdicated all responsibility for six years, putting Obama-hatred above the good of the country. #grassley
@TennIowa @MR_PRIME69 @ChuckGrassley Now whining bef even seated in Jan=prove you can govern GOP instead whine,sue,blk,shutdown,do nothings
@TennIowa @MR_PRIME69 @ChuckGrassley :Stop behind scenes efforts strip PPL's rights=alter Electoral Coll=get voter rights restored instead
@ChuckGrassley @MarkHalperin  Show respect, President Obama holds a title you will never have.
@ChuckGrassley @MarkHalperin Really? Obama just hired some plumbers. Chuck, you are bats*** crazy
@ChuckGrassley Is Nixonian posture the "you know what" that's sold at Dairy Queen?
@ChuckGrassley Yeah that'd be a shame if someone had to do your job for you. Again.
@ChuckGrassley @SteveKingIA
@ChuckGrassley Did you wake up this stupid?
.@ChuckGrassley You supported Bush’s #immigration executive action. Your dangerous close to assuming a hypocritical posture #IAPolitics
Dude, this president left Nixon in the rear view mirror a long time ago.. @ChuckGrassley @instapundit
What nonsense. President has executive powers and SHOULD use them to help our country when Congress won't. @ChuckGrassley @SteveKingIA
@ChuckGrassley Sir, he's already passed dangerous. Now we find out he lied to get Obama care passed. When are you and GOP going to impeach?
@ChuckGrassley assume Nixon dead
“@ChuckGrassley: Pres Obama...getting dangerous close to assuming a Nixonian posture” @ClaraLiving best yet
.@ChuckGrassley @HomerWhite We should be so lucky. Obama has traveled far beyond anything Nixon did.
@chuckgrassley At least he is trying to solve the problem. Congress won't.
@ChuckGrassley @NewCongress4NE Well past Nixon.
@ChuckGrassley @NewCongress4NE way past Nixon. More like Mao or Hitler. Yes I said it
@ChuckGrassley @SteveKingIA how come when Bush and Reagan acted alone on imiigration there wasnt a big fuss!??!?!?! U guys are racist!
@ChuckGrassley @SteveKingIA Radio talk show conservative, Mark Levin, predicted that O would be in 'full Mussolini mode' after the midterm!!
@ChuckGrassley well at least we will have a farmer as head of the judiciary committee, which is a wtf moment if there ever was one!
I don't know what's more fascinating, @ChuckGrassley tweet here, or the comments reacting to it. It's a Nixonian fiat ...
@ChuckGrassley @AJSpiker yes, Barry Soetero is determined to be on the right side of Nixonian history
@ChuckGrassley 
Hang on...
OK, so why don't you answer 1 question 
Why do hate Americans with black heritage?
@ChuckGrassley @SteveKingIA Com'n from the guy that gave the 1%ers the10% tax rate!!! the one who went to Sen with 40acs & mule now millnair
@ChuckGrassley @MarkHalperin Grassley must have a problem with immigrants from Kenya. THEY ARE GOOD MARATHON RUNNERS AND PRESIDENTS.
@ChuckGrassley Really? In truth, Obama's executive orders are fewer than those of G.W. Bush's

@ChuckGrassley lulz
@ChuckGrassley you forgot to add #Benghazi
@ChuckGrassley Hopefully President Biden will assume a Fordian posture and pardon Obama.
@ChuckGrassley LOLOL.
So you're saying Nixonian is bad now?
U so funny!
@ChuckGrassley go get him Chuck, hold him accountable.
@ChuckGrassley why no impeachment?? #dosomething
@ChuckGrassley please don't insult prez nixon
@ChuckGrassley @MarkHalperin Chuck Grassley needs to either stop taking drugs or start taking them.
@ChuckGrassley Thanks for sticking up for Iowa Chuck.
@ChuckGrassley @SteveKingIA  Obama embodies exactly what our Founding Fathers tried to prevent when drafting the Constitution
@ChuckGrassley @MarkHalperin Well ,then do something. You'd rather blame Obama for everything but do nothing yourselves.
@ChuckGrassley I wish Obama would stop issuing EOs & start acting like a Chief Executive. #whatsayu
@ChuckGrassley This is why we are glad to have people like you, Mr. Chuck Grassley, in the positions that you are. Thank you!
@ChuckGrassley you were a Nixon supporter
@ChuckGrassley @SteveKingIA priorities are Our vets, seniors, disabled, truly poor, and our children!
@ChuckGrassley CLOSE?! Get your colleagues in the house to start impeachment proceedings NOW!
@ChuckGrassley the Senate passed a bill, but the GOP house wld not take it up. U LIE!
@ChuckGrassley @SteveKingIA exits polling wants no amnesty!!!
@ChuckGrassley sen u hv been around long enough to not say such garbage, u hv sunk far below wat ur office demands of u, plz stop ur madness
Not really. And where were your objections to all Prez Bush's executive orders? @ChuckGrassley
.@ChuckGrassley Way past Nixon by now. Consider the lies about Watergate, IRS scandal, NSA spying, & Benghazi cover-up. @SenTedCruz
@ChuckGrassley @SteveKingIA Hey r u at Dairy Queen? Order me a Blizzard.
@ChuckGrassley Too bad your capacity for legislating is so far behind your ability to post moronic "thoughts."
@ChuckGrassley @instapundit Dude, he's wearing Nixon's shoes + the NYT and WaPo have tailored Nixon's suits into a Cloak Of Invisibility.
@ChuckGrassley and it's up to you and the rest of Congress to stop his narcissistic ass.
@ChuckGrassley assume oath dead
Oy @ChuckGrassley, don't you have a volleyball game to attend?
@ChuckGrassley @MarkHalperin Grassley knows better. It's sad a distinguished man would become nutjob mouthpiece.
@ChuckGrassley Please explain your theory, Senator Grassley.
@ChuckGrassley  With all due respect Senator.  That is an idiotic statement you just made.  Why don't you LEAD for once!
@ChuckGrassley Obama is the President, not a king. The Constitution was created for a reason.
.@ChuckGrassley fiats are small, so I don't think they can add much to an influx of immigrants.
@ChuckGrassley @instapundit You been asleep the last six years, Chuck? #fastandfurious #irs #benghazi #nsa #etc...
Assume deer dead @ChuckGrassley
@ChuckGrassley @MarkHalperin Rage machine. Do you feel dirty? Or did you get past all that?
@ChuckGrassley nice. Obstruct any semblance of action for years & then criticize prez for acting within his authority. Jackass.
@ChuckGrassley @instapundit Ceasarian
Meaning: he's getting dangerously close to DOING something. Seems more #Reaganesque or #Johnsonian though. @ChuckGrassley @MarkHalperin
.@ChuckGrassley @VikingSeatLic :More accurate to call it, 'Obamian'. Nixon is history, & the only folks who  invoke him are lefty writers.
@ChuckGrassley @instapundit He surpassed Nixon years ago. Why you allow him to usurp your own power is beyond me.
@ChuckGrassley this tweet has verbs AND adjectives THIS IS WHAT PROGRESS LOOKS LIKE
@ChuckGrassley @MarkHalperin his oath?How about yr oath to protect and defend that you've ignored for partisan politics
@ChuckGrassley If so, what are YOU going to do about it? You have the MAJORITY!... IMPEACH or SUE!...   Do Something!
@ChuckGrassley @attachyderm Who typed this tweet? http://gawker.com/5971006/the-15-most-powerful-chuck-grassley-tweets-of-2012 …
@DogmaKinja @ChuckGrassley When you assume deer dead you make an ass out of you, dear.
@ChuckGrassley @MarkHalperin @zerohedge  Close?
@ChuckGrassley @attachyderm This is a Chuck Grassley parody account, right?
@chrittertwit @ChuckGrassley nah there's way too many Iowa volleyball scores for it to be fake.
@attachyderm @ChuckGrassley Check. Drunk intern, then.
@ChuckGrassley go back to tweeting about Dairy Queen and you know what.
@ChuckGrassley Bahahaha, you just accused @BarackObama of acting like a Republican...
@ChuckGrassley @MarkHalperin That wouldn't be necessary if you'd do your fucking job
@ChuckGrassley @MarkHalperin no violation yet, Chuckie. Get off your a$$ and get comprehensive immigration bill passed. @clairecmc
@ChuckGrassley @MarkHalperin The President is within his rights and Mark Halperin shouldn't be retweeting Bull! Problem with the media ...
@ChuckGrassley shut the fuck up.
@ChuckGrassley Hunched over with his arms crossed while scowling and ranting about the Jews and the Irish?
@ChuckGrassley @MarkHalperin BS GOP obstructionists
@ChuckGrassley @instapundit he passed Nixon years ago... fast and furious, bengazi, irs... etc
.@ChuckGrassley If Congress would do a damn thing to address the issues in this country an executive order would be unnecessary. Lead dammit
@Eagle_Vision @ChuckGrassley close??  I would say he arrived quite some time ago.
@ChuckGrassley shut up
@ChuckGrassley GOP has had decades to deal with issues. Seem to prefer DO NOTHING.  Thank goodness O has other options
@ChuckGrassley @MattMackowiak 
Passed the ‘Nixonian posture’ years ago.
@ChuckGrassley Bullshit, Chuck.
@ChuckGrassley He's going to use a small Italian car?
@ChuckGrassley @MarkHalperin ClownsRus..why would retweet slop like this Halperin? Spending little too much time w Joe apparently
@ChuckGrassley @instapundit ...whom also has an enemies list.
@ChuckGrassley I always thought Obama was more like Carter, but you may be right.  I wonder if he has a tape machine.
I would say he has surpassed that point Sen. @ChuckGrassley
@ChuckGrassley do you feel dirty at all when you stoke anger with such disingenuous and intellectually dishonest statements?
@ChuckGrassley That seems dangerously close to a threat, Senator.
@ChuckGrassley Are you saying Obama is turning into a republican President?
@ChuckGrassley ha!  If congress won't act, POTUS will. That's why executive orders exist.
@ChuckGrassley Welp. With a do- nothing senate AND congress now, what else can he do? #neversatisfied #firethegop
@tmkrause the senate is PART of congress and the POTUS cannot legislate. #LowInformationVoter
@RealTadGhostal ;)
@ChuckGrassley just when I thought @SenTedCruz would win the dumbest comment of the day running away, you tie the score Chuck! Well done.
@ChuckGrassley I got fiat and nixonian, do another tweet because I'm close to the bingo here
So what is @ChuckGrassley and the GOP going to so to stop him?  @MarkHalperin
@ChuckGrassley you guys and your buzzwords
@ChuckGrassley oh
@ChuckGrassley What's the score of the N Iowa volleyball game?
@ChuckGrassley wife & i use that 1 sometimes tho we call it "v for victry"
@ChuckGrassley It is not unconstitutional to give executive orders to the executive branch of the government. Civics, man.
@Perkunas687 Who gives executive orders to the executive branch? #justcurious @ChuckGrassley
@jakersmom What does that have to do with the price of eggs? @ChuckGrassley
@Perkunas687 Read your tweet, explain. @ChuckGrassley
@jakersmom Explain the eggs, or the executive orders? Both are fairly easy to understand, so I'm not sure what's holding you up.
@Perkunas687 OK, you have comprehension issues which means you have no idea what you're talking about.
@jakersmom I comprehended every word of "Read your tweet, explain", and asked for clarification. I sent you *two* tweets, not one.
