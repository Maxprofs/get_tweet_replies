@ChuckGrassley @peenerad
@ChuckGrassley Do your job. Represent your people; don't just block everything.
@judg210  His party doesn't control Senate. Reid didn't pass budget for years, violating the Constitution.
@DickInman @judg210 there is no constitutional requirement to pass a budget. Appropriations, yes, budget, no.
@DickInman @judg210 got to stop getting constitution lessons from Palin.
@giantcu92  I stand corrected and you should read a history book abt. Roosevelt and the Supreme Court.
@ChuckGrassley senator were you drunk when you wrote this tweet?
@giantcu92  Tried to pack the Supreme Court. Of course, Wilson did worse.
@DickInman who? POTUS? POTUS is supposed to "pack" SCOTUS.
@giantcu92 This refers to FDR attempt to subvert the Supreme Court bc. He didn't like their authority, like the Preezy.
@ChuckGrassley You're off your rocker.
welcome to #PayolaPoliticians
.@ChuckGrassley ignoring that you lack the communication skills of koko the gorilla, good point, the roosevelts were HORRIBLE for the US
@johnfreiler @ChuckGrassley   The Constitution isn't nearly as big a nuisance as that dumb old Geneva Convention.
@StrasiUnit  The Geneva Convention was ratified for soldiers, not jihadists.
- @DickInman   And it is followed in order to protect our soldiers. And because "we" are not jihadists. Or are we.
@StrasiUnit Yes. I was just pointing out that terrorists aren't soldiers.
@DickInman   Civilian citizens aren't soldiers either. Everyone is protected.
@ChuckGrassley How do the numbers of EO's signed by Obama compare to previous presidents? #grassley #iknowtheanswer
How do they compare to the number of EOs signed by his successor? Some tweets ripen well.
True.
.@ChuckGrassley Jesus Christ Chuck....
Not FDR!? MT “@ChuckGrassley: When Pres Obama says...if Congress won't I will he's like the Roosevelts he considers Constitution a nuisance”
@ChuckGrassley #ChuckJackassley - When Cong votes if it won't I says homey if you got a blow whistle they be like a Churchill or somebody.
@ChuckGrassley ...and as we all know the Roosevelts were terrible presidents.
@ChuckGrassley @corvetteBeth Do you choke your chicken in the Senate chambers? I think lack of blood flow to the brain has affected you! 
@ChuckGrassley @JDaugherty1081 was that english?
@ChuckGrassley  Just do the job you're paid by US to do. Enough slamming Pres. Obama. It's pathetic.
.@ChuckGrassley @corvetteBeth "Constitution just a goddamned piece of paper" - George W Bush.
huffs  paint -------> @ChuckGrassley
@ChuckGrassley  The congress stinks!  Shit or get off the pot!
@ChuckGrassley @DcLincoln761 Mr Grassley, pls repeat after me: there are 3 co-equal branches of OUR govt. thx I knew that u could.
@ChuckGrassley George W. Bush said the Constitution was nothing but a G. D. piece of paoer!
Hey @ChuckGrassley #RooseveltsPBS saved #democracy & got #jobs for 99% of USa while #GOP opposed both. #POTUS #Obama doing same for #USA
@ChuckGrassley  If you used the time & effort you spend making up BS to do your fricking JOB, maybe we'd have the laws PBO's trying to pass
@ChuckGrassley It's not the Constitution that's a nuisance - it's you. You've achieved nothing for Iowans, whose electors twice favored BO.
@ChuckGrassley Heaven yeah Chuck!
@ChuckGrassley Chuck. Everything you say is pure gold. Please don't stop.
@ChuckGrassley really? Comparing Obama to Teddy and Franklin Roosevelt like it's a BAD thing? Go home Senator, you're drunk.
.@ChuckGrassley Do I need a decoder ring for these tweets? How many box tops for one?
@ChuckGrassley @jwlaczniak He's doing nothing unconstitutional and you know it. I'm ashamed to have you as a Senator.
@ChuckGrassley You may recall a President Bush who found the constitution a nuisance.  And Presidents Bush, Reagan, Nixon.
@ChuckGrassley 
You Sir, are a national treasure.
@ChuckGrassley Not to mention that TR was a Republican. Apparently not crazy enough for you.
@ChuckGrassley Yes
@ChuckGrassley If only he were like the Roosevelts. He's acting more like W.
@ChuckGrassley You DO know that the Roosevelts were great presidents, right?
@ChuckGrassley what does this even mean Chuck
@ChuckGrassley thinks comparing Obama to either Roosevelt is an insult. Hello? Mt. Rushmore. WWII.
When Pres Obama says I hv pen and ph if Congress won't I will he's like the Roosevelts he considers Constitution a nuisance
@ChuckGrassley It
@ChuckGrassley He wouldn't have to go to extraordinary lengths if the Republicans hadn't wasted 6 yrs in obstruction.
@ChuckGrassley try doing what the people want instead of what big money wants
@ChuckGrassley Try passing a bill once in a whole. Try compromise. Then I might find your complaint legit.
@ChuckGrassley Watching Ken Burns on PBS, were you?
@ChuckGrassley @asimplesean hahahahaha what the hell
@ChuckGrassley Faced with the worst Congress ever, what would a President Grassley do? #grassley
@ChuckGrassley @meredithshiner so two of the most popular and best presidents of all time? Not sure that’s who you want to compare him to
@ChuckGrassley does ph stand for "phaper", or for "phower"?
@ChuckGrassley You should issue everyone who follows you on Twitter a decoder ring.
.@ChuckGrassley Teddy and Franklin Roosevelt are far better company than Boehner and Co.
@ChuckGrassley I'm not sure what your trying to say chuck...
@ChuckGrassley if only he had gone the overwhelming Signing Statement route like your buddy Dubya.
@ChuckGrassley My God, your head would have exploded if any Dem talked about Bush w/such immature disrespect. Shame on all of you.
@ChuckGrassley Remember, W had made many more executive orders even more questionable than Obama.
@ChuckGrassley no: he considers u & rest of GOP obstructionist & dishonest.
@ChuckGrassley Isn't public broadcasting great?
@ChuckGrassley chuck what are you doing....
@ChuckGrassley pretty great presidents you're talking about, Senator.
@ChuckGrassley Get some sleep Chuck.
@ChuckGrassley We could use a man like Theodore or Franklin again.
@DoremusJ @ChuckGrassley everybody pulled his weight
@ChuckGrassley makes sense 2me
.@ChuckGrassley won't let anything get in his way including twitters character limit and excluding deer.
@ChuckGrassley and he has death panels. Right?
translation, please? @ChuckGrassley
@ChuckGrassley
.@ChuckGrassley Well then why don’t you & the rest of Congress actually DO something? You’re the nuisance, not the Constitution.
@CorinneAM  Harry Reid doesn't let them pash budgets.
@ChuckGrassley Do I get some sort of prize for being able to decipher this?
This man is a Senator, which means he helps decide what is and isn't a law. @ChuckGrassley
@ChuckGrassley do you smell burning toast?  Get to a hospital.
@dpleasant  Did he publish much ?
@jtv818 @ChuckGrassley coud u flw his twt? Very Bcomng of a sentr. 'merica fo sho
