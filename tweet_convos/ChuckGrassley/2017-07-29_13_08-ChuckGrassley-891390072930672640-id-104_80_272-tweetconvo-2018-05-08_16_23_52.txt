I wish you were the Senate majority leader. You'd get good things done with reasonable bipartisan support.The Democrats also represent #USA!
Chuck Grassley does not get anything done.  He obstructs - and distracts - under the GUISE of "pretending to do his job."

Grassley is a Trump HACK who cares nothing about Voters & Democracy & TRUTH- only Party over Country -even if that means kissingVladsRing
How are you saving our tax payer money by flying Trump to his properties and the golf course every weekend? Huge waste right there..
When Trump visits his personal businesses,  it should be entirely on HIS dime, not ours!
 Here is True Pundit blowing the whistle on David Montoya.
You friggin weasel... you are the cover-up and we WONT forget!! TRAITOR

Aren't you targeting whistleblowers who are exposing Trump's collusion & corruption?
You are a big part of the collusion to obstruct justice Grassly, and if indictment time comes, I hope you're next in line to get slapped !
Hey, Chuck, I want to blow the whistle on some enormously fraudulent spending: apparently there are billions slated for a pointless wall.
You are the absolute worst butcher of the English language on this website.
I tried blowing the whistle on you for not listening to Iowans. Got a nice email from you blocking me.
The country has awaken & we need to restore the principles of democracy. Every Act by @GOP must. be reviewed with the Constitution in mind.
YOU sir, are STEALING from the American people,  and then stand up there and act like we don't know about it..you're a crook just like Trump
That's what Iowans are doing to you and Ernst! We're blowing the whistle on your BS and your lack of duty to Iowans!
You're welcome!
If you're concerned about wasteful spending and abuse (which you aren't), you'd better look at @realDonaldTrump's trips to his properties.
Senator Grassley, Thank you for your support in whistleblower protections. Whistleblowers protections must not and cannot be a tiered system
Thanks to @ChuckGrassley - The Godfather of Whistleblowers! He saved my career and got me back to work @DeptVetAffairs helping vets
DANG IT, WHY CAN'T YOU WRITE SO WE DON'T HAVE TO FIGURES OUT YOU DANG PUZZLES!!  YOU WERE A MOCKERY ON COLBERT LAST NIGHT - AND DESERVED IT!

Hey chuck now that you lost the fight to take away peoples Healthcare what idiocy are you gonna try next??
Have the courage to audit the Pentagon & all Branches of the Military.  You will be shocked at what you find in Waste!  Audit everything!
Do folks know that a complete Audit of the Military has never been done? Why is that? Suspect waste & misappropriations. GOP won't touch it!
Tax revolt - I'm not paying for a damn wall - Unless it encloses Steve King's 4th district - then I'll chip in a little.
It's not efficient to allow corrupt bosses to bankrupt us whistleblowers while they stay in govt + keep getting bonuses. Fix the system!
Waste, fraud, interesting words coming from you. Irony anyone?
Shame on you for not having the guts to stand up for what is right. Disappointed beyond words. Thank goodness for whistleblowers.
Don't feel bad about these mean tweets. It will all be over soon and you can retire in disgrace. Traitors going down!

@potus is spending more on vacations in 1 yr than Obama in 8 yrs.  Maybe he should reduce spending so we can afford trans soldiers.
Does that include you Old Man? U R choking the life out of IOWANS ACA so you can save money by killing them? @IowaReview
Why didnt Republican leadership inform  about  as our IC communities confidence grew? #TrumpRussia
NEVER FORGET that in September, McConnell reportedly rejected calls for a unified front against Russia & cast doubt on the intelligence. 5/ 
Biggest waste is paying Trump's businesses & travel expenses. Total so far $29+million. Stop flushing  down drain.
See @realDonaldTrump is going after the @GOP.  How does the story end?
Makes me proud of my Iowa heritage to know we have elected Americans like you. I'll continue to vote for you in every election to come.  SPJ
Get rid of McCain Waste,fraud,traitor. Savings$$$$
