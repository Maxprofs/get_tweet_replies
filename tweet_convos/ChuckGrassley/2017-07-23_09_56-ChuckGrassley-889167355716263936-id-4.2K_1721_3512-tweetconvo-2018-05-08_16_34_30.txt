Sir, if there's no real difference then why not just make them testify under oath? Was not doing so a condition of their cooperation?
You are all missing the real issue.  Will it be transcribed?  Can't prove a falsehood to Congress easily without a formal transcript.
Every hearing is on audio and video tape and everything is recorded by stenographers including classified hearings.
Unless, it's Hillary and gang. Then, the FBI destroys the laptops that contain all the evidence that would have convicted she and her troop.
Yep, and then they gave they destroyed laptops to Martians to keep the evidence away from the real 'Muricans. Go back to cooking ur meth
You're a freak if you don't know that the laptops that Cheryl Mills turned over to the FBI were destroyed and Mills was given immunity.

Uh huh
Tell us how you used documents provided by Russian Intelligence & Natalia Veselnitskaya to open an investigation against Loretta Lynch
But wait....he is now gobe all "Patrioty" and urgently trying to get a bill passed to protect Robert Mueller correct? Seems legit.
*gone*
@DonaldJTrumpJr is trouble already #MuellerInvestigation , don't matter if he's under oath 
That didn't stop Sessions or Kushner (how many do-overs does one get on a security clearance)You know they'll lie = perjury
Then why did you confirm perjurers @USAGSessions @EPAScottPruitt @stevenmnuchin1 @SecPriceMD @BetsyDeVosED ? Why have no charges been made?
Tell Chuck Grassley the Trumps lie all the time & if you can put them under oath, you do it or look like a damn fool
WaPo A1: Trump overruled his team  and personally dictated Don Jr.'s statement on his meeting with a Russian lawyer. https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-dictated-sons-misleading-statement-on-meeting-with-russian-lawyer/2017/07/31/04c94f96-73ae-11e7-8f39-eeb7d3a2d304_story.html?utm_term=.15e4f35e02a2 …
Before this is done, Senator, you will look no better than Devin Nunez.
Deplorables know that liberal lie-yers intend to dismantle the electoral college, re-litigate the 2nd amendment through carefully hand selected judicial appointees, and
to cover up the fact that the only collusion was the committed by Hillary. MAGA
Gotcha, I'll let him know.
Grass key is correct. Calm down.
Jeff Sessions and Scott Pruitt both lied to congress during confirmation hearings and yet you still voted to approve both
Sessions liked the KKK until he found out they smoked weed.“I thought those guys [the Ku Klux Klan] were OK until I learned they smoked pot
You have become a sad embarrassing representative of the United States Of America Congress. And that's how we will remember you.
But not so much with @jeffsessions amiright?
UNDER OATH! No wiggle room
Serve the USA not the party
You sir,r shameful!How can u betray ur own country?That is my opinion after watching ur ACTIONS.
So where are charges against Sessions? Pruitt? Known liars. You are proving cover. What do Russians have on you? #CompromisedGOP
Grassley = traitor
PUT THEM UNDER OATH.

Do your job.
Then why did y'all swear Hillary???
So, why not have them testify under oath?  If there's no difference.  How dumb do you think we are?
And the penalty is????
Why not make them testify under oath?
COVER UP. WHY ARE YOU NOT PROSECUTING SESSIONS AND KUSH FOR PERJURY??
Why won't he be under oath? Americans fed-up w/ Trump & his crime family. They lie, forget, ignore constitution, GOP complicit
@SenFeinstein
What happened to Trump Jr's testimony IN PUBLIC? As you know, he told the nation he'd be glad to testify in public session. Why the secrecy?
Because the crime family rank & file are protecting the little Don!
Chuck, I don't think the message you try sharing with this tweet went how you expected (which makes no sense anyway), try again.
Also, you have had ppl lie while being interviewed and you still voted to confirm.
Why did Sessions have to recuse himself? Oh that's right-he didn't disclose he communicated w/Russians. Under oath 
But yet you did nothing to prosecute Sessions for lying- the American people should call for your prosecution for shamelessly lying to us
18 US Code 2381  treason punishable by death.
Catch him in the act of lying Chuck!
You need to spend your time protecting our democracy.  Get rid of the dangerous menace posing as our POTUS.  GOP = Tribal Psychosis.
I'll just hold my breath then on charges against sessions.
So why not just have them be under oath?
Why wasn't Hillary questioned under oath? Seems a pattern of incompetence or utter disregard for the law where D.C. elite are concerned.
HAHAHAHAHAHA
That's funny to you? 
Never mind. I see you're just a lemming. 
I'm not the one following Trump off a cliff.
Of course, you're also the one cheering for socialism. Nothing more needs to be said.
I know, right? Socialism or barbarism, comrade.
You are a horror of a human & I would assume you are involved in Russia like the Trumps
These should be done in public, Senator. The American people deserve to hear this testimony!
But, @jaredkushner @PaulManafort are liars! Put them under oath
@ChuckGrassley
Why would anyone in this admin believe lying's a crime? They've lied for 2 yrs straight. The punishment: the PRESIDENCY+unwavering R support
telling @jaketapper now, but you're the fool ASSley. and it'll be behind closed doors, wow lack of transparency  never stops with you repugs
Name one person you have held accountable for lying to Congress? There have been many opportunities to do so in the past few years yet...
Sir you are old enough to know better than this...shame on your partisanship. I thought you would stand for more than this
Then why not put him under oath? Why bother to put anyone under oath? #treason
We want transparency...public hearing under oath.  I have trust issues with this administration, because of the constant lying.
Nothing about this is standard.
Lying to congress is a standard way for the Trump administration to conduct themselves. You don't seem to mind.
What are you people so afraid of?
The truth.
Amen! But it's BS! They work for Americans
A little fact that they have seemed to forget...We'll remind them in 2018 & 2020
Because @ChuckGrassley would rather focus on #FusionGPS and divert attention from @GOP to @DNC #NYET
#Complicit
Why were you palling around w/Russian lawmaker at Prayer Bfast same time Kellyanne w/pro-Russian Ukraine rep?
LOL "Kelli Konvey" must be #KellyanneConway's secret Russian spy name. Ask her hubby George about Russian bribes:
"#KellyanneConway’s husband represented firm accused of Russia bribe" http://bit.ly/2kE0pq0  #GeorgeConway #TrumpRussia #FollowTheMoney
KellyAnne’s husband is NO Trump fan! Probably not a #KellyAnne fan either but maybe that’s an #Altfact What is FACT #USA is goin thru #Rtwingnut crazy times & if citizens don’t like this #extremelydangerous corrupt perverted path...Take a page from #Resisters & #ParklandStudents
so why not make the testimony public? why are you protecting KGB colluders? do your job: country over party now, @GOP! #resist #TrumpRussia
history will not be kind, @ChuckGrassley, @GOP
Not to either side
Pit him under oath because it makes it legit.  Country over party is the right way
You are actively engaged in Treason for Trump and Russia, are you taking money from the RUSSIAN KGB? @DMRegister
Then can you look at quite a few of those confirmation hearings of late? Isn't that lying to congress?
It may be a crime but it's not perjury which is punishable by jail time. Put them under oath.  They should not receive special treatment.


Donald Jr. has hired Sen. Chuck Grassley's former staffer to represent him in Russia probe by Grassley's committee. Drain the swamp, indeed. https://twitter.com/levinecarrie/status/889543331222573057 …
@Voix_Of_Reason Why don't you have some one on your staff leak it to him.
What are you going to do about @jaredkushner lying to your committee???
Hey Chuck!  I file single and make $65000. I pay into retirement and state fed and property taxes. I pay health insurance. What u saving me?
Then Kushner lied and should be prosecuted but under the republican regime I’m sure you’ll do your usual nothing and talk about Democrats. You are a disgrace to your country, you have let trump get away with murder and you are just as guilty as they are. Shame on you!
You need to put this serious investigation of the hack of our election over political parties....do your job....we pay you good money..cm on
Anything goes in the @GOP ,,, Lies, corruption, party over country! Nothing has changed in the party for 50 yrs!!  Take that white hood off & start working for the people!
Congress is lying at such a fast rate that this crap is lost in the mess! Why not get a SPINE and do your job instead of witch hunting HC?

Thank you MR.Grassley 4 doing the right thing. We are a law & order country. Government has been corrupt for too long. We voted for change.

@Voix_Of_Reason Hey Chuck remember when Eric Holder lied to congress and got away with it ? I do.
If it makes no difference, then the rest of the country would like to see the trump clan testify openly and under oath. Why shield them?
Russia is not our friend. But they seem to be yours. https://www.c-span.org/video/?322853-1/hearing-cybersecurity-threats …
You mean Hillary right ?The Clintons raked in millions of Russia cash. No investigation.
Then explain why the oath is given?
@DonaldJTrumpJr will lie whether or not he's under oath. It's what the entire family, administration & #GOP does best. #TrumpRussia
@Lawrence @JoeNBC Someone should tell you that trying to cover for Trump in the end will destroy you and anyone who stands by him. Doomed
If what you're saying is true then please explain why an oath would make an appearance to Congress? Well?
Why are @senategop so determined to protect #trumptraitors & defend #Putin ? What will it take for @GOP to put #Countrybeforeparty ?
So put them under oath! And let US hear what they say.
What about lying to the America people?
Think you just did, Chuck. Lotsa snark going round, huh?
Sure...if Clinton was testifying you would demand an oath...you are a hypocrite and traitor
If Kushner is not going to be under oath, then your meeting with him is a window dressing meant to hoodwink  and bamboozle the American pple
More lies from republicans
Trump is closing ACA call centers!  And...I bet that's okey dokey with you, comrade Grassley.
I will thank Jake Tapper for going after the truth. Instead of aiding liars as you are.
You cheated and lied to get your scotus choice and the RESISTANCE knows it.  Back away from the Russian's, sir, before it's too late!
Why r #Kushner & #DonaldTrumpJr not testifying in public under oath? The activities they're accused of do NOT warrant kid gloves treatment!
Perhaps you have already let so many lie to you and get away with it your credibility is lacking. Got it?
Sounds like ole Chuck doesn't have the testicular fortitude to stand up to Agent Orange. Sad! #TrumpRussia #Treasonweasel
Then he shouldn't have a problem testifying under oath. You're protecting the Trump family and their associates. You should be ashamed.
junior continues to lie.....  And you dont want to put him under oath?  Wow  #politicalincompetence
Senator.have them testify under oath. If nothing to hide no prob.  Their testimony shd be the same and the it is perjury
Us intel says Jared asked for back channel for nefarious reason Believe Jared or believe US Intel agencies Believe trump or US intel CSA\USA
Kushner's testimony behind closed doors is a joke. Better start thinking about how history will remember you Republicans
Anybody bother to ask to see the email J sent to his secretary to get "sprung" from the worthless meeting with the Russians
Give us a break, Chuck. You know damn well it would have more legal weight if it was under oath.
Then why not just put them under oath??
Put them under oath and make it public. Anything less looks like a cover up.
It's an even bigger moral crime that you lie us.
I call BS!!
Tell Chuck Grassley that WE THE PEOPLE want them under oath to God BEFORE they lie. True evil has invaded our White House & the Senate GOP.
Do your job hold Sessions accountable for HIS lies! Y not an OPEN session in front of the hill and everyone? What R U afraid  of?
But it's not perjury if not under oath, a felony that carries a potential 5-year term in prison.
You are an embarrassment to Iowa and your abetting a traitor time to retire
Yes, you guys just keep getting it right! Blame everyone else while you keep making America and Americans look like fools! Russia is smiling
So U lie knowing that we know your lying & then you just keep lying more & UR totally fine with it. Do U think your parents would be proud?
DO YOUR JOB

The American people are watching you. You're betraying your oath.
Wondering if Karina Lynch joining Jr.'s lawyer team has anything to do w. closed door & not under oath. She was your investigative counsel
You need to quit acting so oldschool and have some ba*ls.  You: spineless,gutless and NOT WINNING. You are backing a money launderer putin
Have you told Kushner & Manafort? Oh that's right Kushner lied on his security clearance & you did nothing. Sessions lied & you did nothing.
We are depending on YOU a Senator not a REP to get to the truth. Can YOU put COUNTRY before PARTY? Or will you sell out & allow the lies
Your treason will not be forgotten. #TrumpMustGo
Tell grassley he works for the American people, NOT trump...so fvcking act like it!!!
Then why is anybody ever placed under oath? For show?
This needs to be under oath. The whole crew has proven they have a problem with being truthful and forthright.
Then why having you done something about Jeff Sessions!? He lied to congress! Do your damn job!

Let's keep an eye on Grassley he is not on the Americans side. He wants to blame Hillary for Russiagate @birdieglad #STAYWOKE.
Grassley, you're just a Trump/Russia stooge. What do they have on you, comrade?? Put these clowns under oath. Your seat depends on it.
What about Spicer Preibus Investigation. Rence told Sean to steel Bannons Dental Bridge.  Sean stole refridge. Incompetence 4ever
If it's the same, why not put him under oath? It takes less than 10 seconds. You've stopped making sense, Mr Grassley.
Seriously this is just pathetic. Not that I would expect anything else out of you.
The American people want a public hearing, under oath. Nothing else will remain above skepticism.
Why aren't they testifying under oath? Do whats best for America not what Fox News Wants.
Worthless
@ChuckGrassley nothing is standard about @GOP sellouts to Russia- where do you stand? Firmly behind one of them #traitor in the making
Tapper knows this. Do you? What have you done about Sessions' lies to congress? You have actual power.

Like Duh-bya Bush and Dick Cheney would only testify about the 9/11 attacks if they appeared together and not under oath? What was that?
Tell chuck grassley its time for him to retire.
Great, SO it will be under oath then, if either way works.
If they admit guilt will you be saying that they are innocent?
Why not just put them under oath?
It not when it was Mrs Clinton in open court for hours under oath. We the ppl see through you bs sir
You and your Repub buddies don't seem too concerned about crimes threatening our republic, so what's an oath matter to you?
Seems like lies have been told already, false documents filed,  will you hold all to responsible to the rule of law. You took an oath.
Why not under oath? Anyone else would have to swear to the truth. You Repubs are aiding and abetting these criminals. Russia has you too!
That's what I was thinking.  Thanks for clearing that up, Sen. Grassley.
Why would you not want the testimony under oath? Because you know they will just lie thru their teeth anyhow?
So make the testimony public for all 3 of these known liars. How many instances of lying were on their "disclosures"? Why tell truth now?
its obvious the republicans are full of shit regarding rule of law being applied to trump b/c he gets to call in loyalty pledges via twitter
If it the same thing let them do it under oath.  Otherwise you are the suspect collaborator.
All you care about is getting the leakers in trouble (just like djt), even though THEY are the REAL PATRIOTS who are serving their country 
HE SHOULD BE UNDER OAT U KNOW THAT WHY ARE YOU LETTING HIM GET AWAY WITH IT WHAT R U HIDING OR PROTECTING
Why think you're serious bout that? He has lied before and when caught changes them and receives no repercussions. GOP likes liars
You'd have a democrat under oath in a heartbeat though! We see you! YOU lie! Shame! COMPLICIT!!!!!!
Why are Kushner and Manafort not under oath, Senator?
didn't stop numerous in the drumpf admin. from doing it
Well,Chuck, today JARED was "interviewed" by "staffers"-not Senators. So he wasn't talking to "Congress"-and he wasn't UNDER OATH. #Bullshit
You are not a patriot or for America!  You are an old white man that needs to retire!
All Trump's are Pathological Liars. This *Hearing* is a Fricking Joke & REAL American's KNOW it!
Jr. Will lie no matter what. He could be talking to Jesus himself and he would lie
Sooooo, AG Sessions is criminal?? He is a criminal. An illegal AG? Criminal. Sessions lied & he's a criminal. What ur saying is: criminal.
WE THE PEOPLE are telling YOU, elected to SERVE US, that we want him publicly speaking, UNDER OATH.
Cancel it!!! Wasting your time and our taxpayer dollars if not under oath.
“The Trump administration has taken no public steps to punish Russia for its interference in the 2016 election.
Then why not put them under oath?
You don't care about this country..SOwe can help you pack your bags and we will even put you on a boat to RUSSIA!
If he lies without oath he is just breaking false statements law If he lies after taking oath he is also breaking perjury law
You are all going to be covered in the stink of this sleazy business
Then put Junior and Jared under oath and have them testify in public. If it's no big deal? This pussyfooting around   loses you credibility!
So sad and absolutely pathetic what you've become, are you happy with yourself... better get right with your indecencies, your old... 
Why? Are you scared to do it yourself? Afraid   to get bested on record? P*ssy
#DisgracefulGrassley
What will you do Chuck if they lied?
Didn't Comey take an oath? So guess it's only standard with some?
Oh really??  Comey under oath but his "accusers" not??  That SUCKS CHUCK
Senator, what's the difference between an interview with Congress and testimony under oath? Honestly, I hope you can help us understand.
Why did Sessions get away with lying to Congress?
Nothing std about anything these days. How about putting some accountability in place?
This is a truth-challenged family as it is.
Stop covering for these crooks. We're all getting tired of the GOP cowering down to this aristocratic dictator. Enough is enough!
This should be public AND under oath.  You know what else is a crime...Treason.  Have fun sitting on the side of Kid Rock 
grassley, Why u blocking investigation?  Russian criminal!  Are you compromat or just greed driven by oil and oligarchy.
Senator, u will all b voted out 4 allowing traitors 2 dictate 2 Congress "What they r willing 2 do"

They will lie anyway, oath or not!
You are a liar and a traitor to our democracy. You made a deal &covering their asses. If it does not matter either way have them under oath.

Then why won't they be under oath if it is the same thing?
Do they own you 2  Chuck? We  do NOT accept traitors as our leaders. In any capacity. Do the right thing - under oath & public testimony!
At least be honest as to why they aren't under oath.
@jaketapper     What about Mr. Sessions lying to Congress? under oath I believe.  If lying is a crime, why is Sessions not prosecuted?
Serial liars should be put under oath. Not standard witnesses. Shameful dereliction of leadership. Handing Iowa's power grid to Putin.
The last "accomplishment" of a long and distinguished senatorial career will be that Grassley was asleep when his nation needed him
Then why not under oath??
GET REAL #TrumpRussia
Why are those two NOT under oath ??? You are a traitor too??? #TrumpRussiaCollusion
Then why NOT have them under oath?  What's the point, & what r u ppl trying to hide? U & the rest of @GOP are beyond disgraceful.
Ball's in  your court Chuck.  You up to the task of putting out the Constitutional fire trump & his spawn have lit?
Why are you letting them slide? They should answer for their TREASON before the American people! Patriot before party. Man up chucky #Resist
If this satisfies you, Grassley, then YOU are not taking YOUR OATH seriously! Don Jr already said publicly that he WOULD testify under oath.
This was during a lie publicly stated on Fox that "This is everything." Then we found MORE.
YOUR OATH of office is now under question...
RT RT RT RT RT RT
Please tell us which parts, IF ANY, of YOUR oath of office that you actually SWEAR to America that you will honor...
