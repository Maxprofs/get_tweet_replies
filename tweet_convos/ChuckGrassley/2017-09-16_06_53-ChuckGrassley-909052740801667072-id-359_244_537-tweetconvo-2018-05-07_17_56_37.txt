You are a liar! I guess GOP never did the same. Some appointments are absolute scum and you know it. Country over party!
Maybe Trump should stop nominating flat earthers and bigots.
Your hypocrisy is disgusting. You refused to hold hearings on 79 #Obama nominees.
They are filibustering due to the fact Trump makes poor choices when left to his own devices. Iowa is a swing state can you feel the swing.
Is this why you are now spending all your time actively trying to discredit the Russia Probe? Trump didn't just offer you corn did he?
Please oppose this:
People with pre-existing conditions, pregnant women among those who lose out in GOP's latest health care bill. http://apne.ws/iP7et7Z 
Senator Chuck Grassley: "Repealing ObamaCare Is More Important Than Whatever Replaces It". .... did you say this?
Why are you supporting trump who is a traitor & belongs in jail? Why R you taking healthcare away from millions & giving a tax break to 1%?
Wow! Deja vue!! Karmas a bitch, ain't it!?! You reap what you sow
http://verifiedpolitics.com/mccain-just-exposed-republican-colleagues-shady-scheme-undermine-russia-probe/ … Talk about obstruction chucky!
Nominees are an embarrassment to all. No qualifications, no experience, worst choices imaginable.
Tell @realDonaldTrump to stop choosing the worst, most unqualified and most destructive person for the job and the filibusters might stop.
I agree w/ U on  nominees. Ditch Mitch doesn't want POTUS to succeed.Need leadership that can lead! NBC poll MM= 17% approval
because they are not worthy of positions for which nominated Unlike GOP not putting party above all else.
Merrick Garland. And @realDonaldTrump picks unqualified corrupt uneducated traitors
Remember Merrick Garland?  Grassley, you are a beady eyed weasel elected by morons.  "Unplug gramma!" #trumpcuck
You mean so they can put cabana workers and a trucker in charge at the USDA?
G - gaslight
O - obstruct 
P - project

Did you hold a single hearing for Merrick Garland?
I thought it stood for 
Grand 
Old
Propagandists
Ummmm. Merrick Garland?!?!?!
Thank you Mr Grassley. Do it, our Nation needs these positions filled.
Embarrassing you continue to support this president. Do you NOT love this country? Represent your constituency!
Quit putting thugs in the WH and do your job!
If you had a leader he could end this BS since you don't Schumer will continue to control the senate
JUST LIKE THE GOP DID TWO PRESIDENT OBAMA WHO WAS A MUCH BETTER PRESIDENT THE 45! PRESIDENT OBAMA DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE HEALTH CARE AWAY!? FU!
Wait. Cloture for nominations requires 51 votes. Your party has 52 votes. How are the Dems stopping you?
Some votes still require 60 people.
Wow, a trump supporter not understanding the process! What are the odds?!?
Hypocrisy from Chuck- remember Merrick Garland!!
Remember the Joe Biden rule?
Never a "rule"! Never invoked until Garland! Stop spreading dishonesty! Sen. Grassley is reaping what HE has sewn.
Dems just don't like being treated like they treat others!
Lol, whatever you say, #fakechristian
This is pathetic!
You are voting to blow up healthcare for Americans and this is what you whine about? What a pathetic example of Congressional leadership.
The GOP used blue slips to block Obama’s nominations or did you forget  https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2017/05/25/blue-slips-and-judicial-nominees-in-senate/ … #DumpGrassley #ThisMansOnKoch #KochAddict
Dems are doing their jobs. It's called checks and balances. It's a shame your side allowed many of them through. DeVos, Sessions..etc
Dems are most certainly not doing their job unless you consider calling people racist, bigot, Nazi doing your job.
If the racist, bigoted Nazi shoe fits...!

The GOP deserves as much stonewalling as possible. Incompetent candidates for almost all positions chosen exclusively to screw Americans.
if you had a leader in the Senate this wouldn't be a problem

Amazing quote from @ChuckGrassley here: Despite many reasons to oppose Graham-Cassidy, GOP must support it to uphold campaign promises. 
#inners Your comment that you must fulfill promises. You promised to repeal & replace NOT to Repeal & kill citizens & babies
Not enough nominees to filibuster sir
Fake news
Yea. So do you regret setting that precedent when you did it to @BarackObama ?
Stop destroying this country! Trump is a treason weasel and YOU KNOW IT!!!
Aren't you playing world's smallest violin. GOP did it w/last administration.Threatened to do it to Hillary Clinton. GOP made the rules.
Because his nominees are unqualified!
It would really help if the nominees were at all qualified for their positions but most are not.
First of all your nominees deserve to be filibustered and second- how does it feel @ChuckGrassley ? Sucks, doesn't it?

You are a joke you owe it to your people in your state to not gut there health care period
U republicans are working with democrats to investigate him and try to throw him from office time to replace these republican senators
The GOP stole a supreme court member .   You stonewalled Obama 8 years.   The Dems are protecting the country from your party.
Nuclear Option
How ABT trying to put in a full work yr like the ppl do
Works for me, Chuck. Congress needs to get to work legislating, not sitting on their entitled rear ends. Your help is appreciated.
Chuck,  Read my tweet "END the FILIBUSTER" no more excuses for doing nothing and accomplishing less
Dang, even Chuck has his own "Media Matters Troll Patrol".......man they must be scared.
But.....but.....they want the best for our country. I hope y'all get to the bottom of al the corruption and start perp-walking folks soon.
Cause you never filibustered anyone when Dems were in charge. Hypocrite, party over country, donations over healthcare. #shameful.
You should be devoted to representing the people.
Most positions Trump need filling HAVE NO NOMINEES. The ones being objected to ARE HORRIFICALLY UNQUALIFIED AND SHOULD BE REJECTED.
How about GOP & Trump nominate someone who believes in America, not just big money and killing the constitution
You're seriously pushing a blame the Dems narrative after stealing the Garland seat? Resign now
Remember when you all wouldn't even give Obama's Supreme Court nominee a vote?  Sucks, doesn't it?
Perhaps Trump should actually nominate people who are competent.
Quit your whining, a-hole.  You reap what you sow.
Tough choking your own medicine down, ain't it?
noun: hypocrisy
the practice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs to which one's own behavior does not conform; pretense.
a dad makes $90k a Mom makes $90k YET a gov Funded Paycheck pays 1/2  of #SS medicare Tax than a #Gov #Employee that makes $180K, its #THEFT
REMEMBER:  Democrats choose illegal aliens over American citizens.  Election Day is Tuesday, November 6th, 2018.  Dems will lose big.
They learned this from McConnell over the last 8 years. Vote NO for ACA repeal. Killing civilians is not the answer. #MtVernonVoter
you mean like republicans did for all of Obama's nominations
Remember when you wouldn't give Merrick Garland a hearing? Stop holding double standards.
Tell your  to stop nominating completely unqualified people. 
Tough shit Chuck,you stalled for over a year on Obamas pick.
Senator Grassley why not 10or20 nominees and don't forget Mon Tue We'd Thur instead of just Fri
Need to put up nominees that are competent
Chuck, the sad thing is, I'm sure you believe this. How can you stand on such hypocrisy?
How about devoting some time to saving health insurance for your constituents?    Vote no on Cassidy Graham bill.
Under the latest GOP #Trumpcare bill, Cassidy-Graham, Iowa would lose $525 Million in federal funding. #ProtectOurCare
But they aren't really filibustering. Why let the threat of a filibuster be so powerful? Let a filibuster happen, then move on
Come on, Senator. Knock it off. You used to be better than this.
Yes, Garland anyone?  Up yours.
Where were you Senator for Iowa Veteran Honor Flight? This is your State and your Veterans
Says the guy who blocked Obama's SC nominee. #PotMeetKettle
Merrick Garland says hi.
Maybe the Senate could just change the Senate Rules, but seems they want to play old time politics i.e. @SenateMajLdr
Specifically, which nominees have the @SenateDems filibustered? Please provide a list of names and the nominees intended positions. @AP @BBC
You and your colleagues must subpoena Trump records relevant to Russia, emoluments, lobbying, financial conflicts etc. @SenateDem
You gotta be kidding.
Maybe you should examine WHY. Trump nominees are profoundly unqualified & most are against the very positions they've been nominated for.
GREAT IDEA,does #DITCHMITCH agree or is he still in bed resting? Lord knows he doesn't work! Holds up 208 BILLs?! SHAMEFUL!!! #DrainTheSwamp
Only 12 Days of Working is Sad - Should work like Regular Americans 40+ hours a Week. If Project isn't Complete then stay until Completed!
#MerrickGarland
Merrick Garland.  Shame on you.

I did not realize that your tweet attracted every liberal in Iowa.  Keep the faith and ignore the looney left.
I agree and you should also stop the blue slip practice.  I don't ever agree with McConnell but on Blue Slips, he is absolutely right.
Your memory is short. You should retire. Please!
Pot meet kettle.  Hypocrisy of GOP is breathtaking.  What GOP did to Obama & Merrick Garland was despicable .  GOP has won w RU help.
Dear Chuck: 
Retire.
These idiot Dems forgot about schumer blocking Janice Rogers Brown nomination by bush 43. Proof schumer is a racists as are most dems
Or maybe you should listen to the message. We don't want his nominees. He is a horror, & we won't forget your support of him.
Why aren't you doing your job & looking at Facebook,Trump,Kushner. Too partisan to lead.
Can't filibuster what Agent Orange doesn't nominate. Oh and Merrick Garland too.
You used to be Iowan. Now you're just a GOP tool. RESIGN
Merrick Garland??
Cheetoh man needs to pick non-losers!!
How about this? Since you stole a supreme court seat you just zip your lips....
U literally were the obstructionist party for 8 years
You are absolutely shameless.  Unbelievable.
Hypocrite. Retire. Now.
Nominees need to be qualified for their positions! Not just pushed through b/c trump put them up. Our nation deserves better
Thank you, Senator Grassley! My Dad would have liked you! He was a farmer in Illinois.
Yet another incompetent! Please stop destroying our Country. We love America and want to keep it.
Please don't let the Russian Plant, #Trump destroy our Country! Please do not. Please do not.
Ps public servants are key not politicians   Hope D.C. Knows we care
Maga
Grass  stain? I wonder how Obama felt.
POS

Merrick Garland. You old fool.
Merrick Garland. You hypocrite
This is a diversion and scape goat tactic. This dude isn't making noms. Ur a snake Grassley.
Isn't that what you did to them? Sounds like the pot calling the kettle black. Stop pointing fingers at each other & get to work. DSM mom 
Yes! Need about 50 more just like U!
Can't filibuster what's not been nominated. You suggested watching real news not fake, why push fake information?
With all due respect senator, did you forget you guys wouldn't give Merrill Garland a hearing??
Why are you protecting the obvious lying Traitor Trump? He is a disgrace to our country and the GOP ought to put country before party.
Mike Pence knew about Michael Flynn taking money from foreign governments too.  Are you keeping democracy safe?
There is a Russian traitor in the White House, Jared still has a security clearance and you do nothing.  Reprehensible
Hypocrisy does not become you especially given your role blocking hundreds of Obama judiciary appointments for years. #MerrickGarland # Fail
Setting aside Merrick Garland, how long did you sit on the other appointments.
Yeah right. YOU have the majority.

The Republicans filibustered for eight years! Even shut our government down, and stole a justice seat. All to bring us to this hate n chaos!
Would think you'd be happy not having to push another incompetent raving idiot into our democracy. Is it your love for Trump or hate for US?
Get busy! Stop the obstruction! Geez, pathetic what you are allowing them to do. Change the rules as Pres says! Get SOMETHING DONE !!!!!!
Don't be jealous you're no longer in the minority and can throw a fit whenever politically expedient.
Merrick Garland
Too bad you didn't feel the same way the previous 8yrs!
Turnabout is fair play. Some of us don't forget.
Are they just trying to run the clock until the next election. Maybe if Republicans were less busy investigating Trump...
His nominees are bad. They are grifting. Pull your head out and pay attention.
Do you think it is good that they are using public office to profit privately?
Maybe Trump should put forth nominees that aren't racist assholes. Someone like Merrick Garland, for instance.
Never forget.
Did it ever occur to you that many of Trump's nominees, like Sam Clovis, are awful and you should be voting against them too?
Merrick Garland, enough said.
Guess the Dems took #GOP & @SenateMajLdr lessons from obstructing President Obama to heart. Karma is a bitch.
Maybe the 60 vote rule should disappear permanently.
Merrick Garland. Remember him?
Yeah. Because the nominees have been so amazing this far.
Or if not, maybe they could devote Fridays to strategy sessions, to figure out how to get their approval rating up to double digits.
Because the nominees are subpar. U should be supporting country over party, not this corrupt administration.  #DumpTrump
Friday's should be devoted to impeachment and working on Russia probe that you have been slacking in.
.@ChuckGrassley Your hypocrisy knows no bounds. You support someone who openly joked about sexual assault. Classy. #IA01
Does the name Merrick Garland ring a bell?
I'd just like to say where you can go and what you can do there.
Excellent idea!
Chuck tell the truth for once. Trump has not named any nominees
Excellent idea.  Nominee Friday's.  We can't let the Left control our country.  #nomineefriday.
Right!!! The Left might drag us out of a depression again, I mean, er, nevermind
says the man who wouldn't let an Obama nominee even have a hearing. oh the irony and the balls to call out dems.
Like you did with Obama.
This sounds like a DT tweet.  Is this a flip/flop? Thought calendar was "full".  Can't wait to see the promised transcipts, though.
Remember when the Republicans went out of their way to block Obama's nominations, including the all-important SCOTUS? The People remember.
The North remembers!!!
just like the days of Obama eh ole boy?
Tell Mitch to get his shit together! Work a full schedule!!! We waited 8 years to make thing Right...the GOP US Senate has failed !
There's no real reason for filibustering -- the Dems just want to keep @POTUS from promoting his agenda. There's got to be another way.
Decent Americans should be doing everything possible to halt the nominations of degenerate bigots like Sam Clovis. Shame on you.
SHAMEFUL
MERRICK GARLAND MERRICK GARLAND MERRICK GARLAND MERRICK GARLAND MERRICK GARLAND MERRICK GARLAND MERRICK GARLAND MERRICK GARLAND
Robert Bork (repeat 8 times) or however many you did +1
Bork got a hearing.
If that's the litmus test then Garlands family should be glad he did not.
Stop the filibustering. The democrats would go around Y'all. This nonsense. You have the majority. Do something.
Chuck, you do whatever it takes to get your Grandson that Iowa Ag job! This is America where the chosen and your families only prosper!
How about you guys look into whether or not the president is a traitor, or gave more foreign agents security clearances?
All talk & no action! Another Republican Establishment who does NOTHING 2 help POTUS~How much r u being paid 2 keep silent on surveillance?
Betsy Devos...  seriously. You should be thanking them.
Gorsuch.
And Saturday's until you guys get it done. And, Monday repeal Obamacare
Garland is different than passing nominees for the executive. Article II Sec 2 says he didn't deserve a vote. HRC was heavily fav to fill it
Hey, Chuck, what about Merrick Garland? Such a hypocrite! How do you say this shit with a straight face?
So Sen @ChuckGrassley you object to the same tactics you used on President Obama's nominations. #hypocrit
Or maybe we are reaping what we sowed by using the exact same tactics over the last 8 years
@Stonewall_77 this is ridiculous, why hasn't trumps nominees been approved. Get to work
Oh, come now. It's not like they're obstructing a qualified Supreme Court nominee for no other reason than a black president nominated them.
No, it wasn't because Obama was black. It was because Garland was liberal.

Just like you Republicans filerbusted Obama's? Hypocrisy much. Hate you representing my state
Stop letting the Dems control everything still...
You and the entire GOP are stale. We are ready for a progressive and inclusive democracy.
And what did you do last year with Garland? #Resign, Chuck.  You are a hypocrite!
Did you try bribing them with your rubles?
Better nominees would be good. In many cases any nominee at all would be a start.
The real answer is qualified nominees.BTW do we need to dredge the wks & mo of Repub obstruction for Obama nominations?
