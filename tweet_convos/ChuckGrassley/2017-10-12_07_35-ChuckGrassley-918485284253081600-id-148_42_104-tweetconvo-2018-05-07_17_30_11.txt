Yep, grandson is heir apparent. Us plebians have no say in govt anymore.

I vote but it honestly doesn't feel like it matters anymore.
Get up, dust off and get after it. I'm ready to die on this hill.
If under-funding the government was going to work miracles, wouldn't it have worked already?
Massive Tax Cuts for VICIOUS RICH REPUBLICANS, Merciless Mercers, Cruel Kochs,  Brutal Adelson, only Crucifixion for US @DMRegister
Tried to read your word salad about tax cuts. Impossible. Short version: the proposed framework primarily benefits top 1%, hurts all others
Evidence-based science please which shows how tax cuts will DIRECTLY  lead to jobs and not robot/automation jobs that benefit only owners.
Screw Americans so GOP can have tax cuts for the wealthy. That's the only thing you care about.  It's time we get new young people in office
We need term limits so all these old men trying to take rights away from women will be out of office. Your to damn old to do your job right.
Americans want to progress. All these old men want to take things back so women won't have any rights.We need young people that bring energy
Paula, bless your heart, you suck up all that propaganda & amazingly believe it.
I Quess you believe everything Trump says. He lies everyday of his life. U believe the liar in Chief w/ severe mental instability. I'm not!
Was stagnation an auto-correct slip?
>Use of capital letters with wild abandon
>OBAMA[noun]!!!

Chuck, I expected better from you.
Kansas tried this and it failed.  This is only about tax cuts for the rich.
Hell, it's happening in Iowa too, after Branstand cut taxes on businesses here.

The economy @realDonaldTrump is taking credit for is thanks to @POTUS44
It only helps people over a certain tax bracket. Under that, it may only raise taxes which most Iowans can't deal with. Look into this.
Laughable, I am always amazed at the talent some have to distort the truth! Oh yes, truth is at an all time low.
@LindseyGrahamSC Puerto Rico is Congress GOP’s and trump’s concentration camp.

So thankful for our new administration!!  #MAGA
Drop this delusion.  The Trump tax plan is a way to make the rich richer and everyone else poorer.  Your credibility is gone.
I would trade tax cuts for a greatly simplified tax code.  Complication leads to confusion leads to stagnation.  #smartregulation
Obama did not stagnate, U lie like trump, trickle down has been disproven, it is a cover for rich getting richer like you multimillionaire!
Trickle down never works. Search productivity v wages. And now Senator deficits don't matter? Tattoo that on your MAGA hat too!
You told the truth about not being the biggest, why lie about the good they do? They Benefit the rich only.

8 years of Obama Failures Thank God for POTUS and good Senators like you Senator Grassley
You’re yet another lying gop crook. The rich don’t need another break. Trickle-down is a #lie.
Liar.
Stagnation results from Republicans continued embrace of failed policy known as Trickle Down.   All that has accomplished is NOTHING.
It does not help the middle class,but it does help u & ur rich friends.

You have a Different History got Obama You must Be Thinking The Republican W Administration! We Know your Mind I’d Not Working old Age !m
Wish U were less partisan and better researched than you are.  Bush's 10 year tax cut for the rich in 2002; produced no net new BW Jobs!
Uninformed & Partisan Charlie: Bush's Tax Cut cost Treasur $6.6 Trillion in much needed Revenue over 10 years; & added to Nation's Debt!
What About Russia & the Traitor Trump! You have Enough Proof to Impeach! Do Your Job!
Stagnation? He led us out of the Bush recession , no thanks to you...
Hey Chuck you still working to protect comrade Trump from the Russia investigation?  #russianpuppet
Yeah, how'd that work in Kansas, Senator?
And Grassley lies again.  Tax plan is a horror to everyone but the top 5%. Obama saved us from the brink of disaster and you know it.
if OBAMA was STAGnation? what was 2007-09?
Smlification might save a few federal dollars, but will do nothing for the folks that aren't your rich donors
Has your GOP pervert in chief resigned yet? Screw your subcontractors with a bogus bankruptcy. Not a good plan for the government Chuck!
Chuck you and your HOLE IN THE WALL GANG OF THUGS, is the only thing stagnet around here.
Obama Stagnation?  He had to fix the mess you made with Bush. You're going to get us right back there. You're an ungrateful fool.
You need to RESIGN Grassley. You are a crooked self serving politician and you DONT stand for the American people. You need removed now
What about the DEFICIT Chuck? Why does this mostly help the rich? Already way too much income inequality
Liar
 asshole
Stagnation?  Check your facts chuck
you're a traitor .. we see you Mr. Trade Your Soul For Bio-fuel
“Obama stagnation?!” 

The irony is it was you & your do-nothing congressional colleagues who ran interference on everything. #resign
2/2 millions of jobs have been created since the "bush tax cuts" put us in recession, because of @BarackObama economy that Trump enjoys taking credit for
Trickle down supply side deficit busting tax cuts? (oops, reform)
You need to look up “stagnation” in the dictionary, I don’t think it means what you think it means since the economy improved under Obama
It doesn’t create jobs, never has and never will. Stop using that line to fool people that don’t know better.
Did the Bush tax cuts create growth? Did the Obama tax cuts create sufficient growth and well-paying jobs? How much more evidence is needed that tax cuts =\= growth?
Move beyond GRASSLEYstagnation!  Are you one of the congressman on Alzheimer medication?  Appears so!
Obama created jobs!!!  Don't release fake news!!!
Trash talk
Please retire
Obama stagnation caused by a republican congress who swore from say 1 to oppose anything Obama wanted to do!!!
Simplify, but increase revenue overall.  85 months in a row of job gains was stagnation?!
Confirm Trump's judges! Congress: Investigate Democrat's Pakistani IT staff's criminal enterprise ran out of the House of Rep! Oversight?
Dear Mr Grassley,
Please find the nearest dictionary and look up the word “stagnation”.
Sincerely,
A Concerned Iowan
I really thought you were better than this, apparently you think the American people are stupid I am here to assure your we're not.
"Now, for truth on tax cuts we go to our Kansas corrs., Laffer Curve. Laffer, tell us what you've found."

"It's bullshit. Chuck's lying."
BS
You are running out of Obama's coattails
Have you not learned from Kansas?
Do you realize if you let this continue there will be no reason for tax reform
Gads, watching this show is more disgusting than House of Cards. Try the KISS option- simplicity always works.
Why are you letting these people continually lie and make a mockery of our country, is it really just for this tax reform... DISGUSTING
Right now I don't give a crap about tax reform, I want to know why is Jared Kushner is making millions in the tech biz... Have you no morals
Did you really just tweet Obama  Stagnation? Despite it never working before, you actually believe "trickle down" stimulates? Unbelievable!
72 straight months of job growth & near-full employment is "stagnation"? If you have to lie to get support for policies change the policies.
as a Republican, will you publicly commit to only voting for a deficit neutral tax bill? Seems reasonable
Wow do you always need to be negative at first can't you just get something done and be supportive
As millions die from Trumps Healthcare EO and Trump pulling FEMA from PR, who will be left to pay taxes?
All the drama
So for 30 years you chose to be a wasteful use of my tax money? Why did you stay, sucking in all my tax money?
acknowledge CHUCK:between 2008-2016,stock market went from 9000 to 18,000.a financial fact.coming off the worse fin.crisis,since depression.

These tax cuts for the rich aren't free, we have to cut Medicare by 473 billion and Medicaid by 1 trillion.  It will also increase the debt.
No one believes you guys anymore. Sit down, shut up and get some real work done for #WeThePeople and not just for we the rich people
Trump says the economy is doing well and unemployment is low.   So why are we cutting taxes on the rich?
The very rich will do well under this plan but many middle class will see a tax increase.
What the president needs is support, not a member of the party questioning him in public.  Let the libs attack, but we should support.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @jeffsessions @TheJusticeDept @FinancialCmte @SpeakerRyan @GOPoversight
What I have seen of tax plan only real beneficiaries r people like Mercers.Do not let Trump eliminate Unesco & aid 2 Puerto Rico
"Stagnation" is due to Republican OBSTRUCTIONISM, minimum-wage rejection, and anti-worker/union laws which led to layoffs in recent decades.
Obama/Dems had bills that would have created jobs; GOP refused to consider them for political purposes.
It will raise rates on nearly all middle class families while dramatically increasing the debt.  Simple shouldn't destroy our children's future, Chuck.
Companies will buy back stock or buy other companies and lay off their workforces with the extra capital.  Get real, Chuck.  Let's stop fibbing in Iowa.
If you really cared about jobs you would force companies to hire based on a targeted tax cut.  That's not what this plan is.  It's a giveaway to the wealthy while we hand our kids a bleak future because we are dead beats and refuse to pay our debt.
There is no ObamaSTAGNATION, Liar.
USA ruled & looted by Home grown Financial Terrorists led by Fraud Wall St Banksters & Fraud Congress/senate puppets


FRAUD JEB HENSARLING & MAXINE WATERS ARE TWO DANGEROUS FINANCIAL TERRORIST AT FSC IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OBAMA/EHOLDER

UR tweets r the best, Chuck.

Chuck, much as you'd like to think we're still in the 1980s, we're not. People understand that this is factually inaccurate. Tax cuts don't drive growth - much less reduce inequity - but they sure do drive deficits. So, as I usually say: #stoplying
Let's all just simmer down guys, this is tinkle down economics. Don't pee on my leg & tell me it's raining.
USA ruled & looted by Home grown Financial Terrorists led by Fraud Wall St Banksters & Fraud Congress/senate puppets
Chuck Grassley (in GWB era) screwed things up so badly that it took YEARS for Obama era policies to get us out of recession. No going back!
DJIA 2009-2017. Stagnation?
Grassley, your lies will come back to trouble you very soon.
UR #Liar friend of #MoronTrump
There is no direct empirical evidence between tax cuts & job growth. Always many external factors involved.

.@ChuckGrassley 4/4 YOU = OBAMA STAGNATION
Thank you for all you do Senator Grassley!!!
all he does??..where U been?...no plan,none for iowa citizens being kicked off aetna Healthcare ins....NO PLAN FROM CHUCKLES!
Tax cuts do not create jobs. Period. There is no empirical evidence for this.
Pres @BarackObama didn't have job stagnation, but u know that. What has been stagnate is wages for decades! Cost of living soured, not wages
Stagnation? You think Americans are morons don’t you?
CHUCK your giving aid and comfort to a traitor and we see you doing it.
Obama created 11.3 million jobs (compared to W's 2.1 million) & 75 months of straight job growth.
#Facts
Wow. Taking the Prez to school. Now if you could impeach him before he gets us nuked by North Korea, that would be peachy
Playing chicken with our national security so you can payoff your high end donors? You should be ashamed @ChuckGrassley  #DonTheCon #USA
stagnation? He took office w/ your 'big indicator' stock market at 8000. And left office with it at ~17k.
Highest rate of employment in years? Stagnation? Business profits at record highs, but tax cuts?
Stagnation?  Obama grew the Dow by 250% - 8k to nearly 20k. Unemployment cut by 75%. Call us when Trump even comes close to that.
Chuck is off his meds
How is Trump Treasonous let me count the ways
No less then 16 people in his administration lied about meetings with RUSSIANS including Trump & Pence. 2 perjured themselves
Two people in the Trump administration had to register as Foreign Agents including the National Security Advisor. Let that sink in
His campaign actively sought illegally obtained Intelligence from RUSSIA to usurp a Presidential Election.
Trumps own son meet with the RUSSIANS to coordinate the release.  He even told us "I love it especially later in the summer"
Trump fired Comey to get the "Pressure Off" He even told the RUSSIANS that in the Oval Office wile sharing code level Intelligence
Mr Grassley. After all the information even in the public domain your inaction is a failure of your oath. Are you a Russian or American
WoW...ALL of your points are slanted #FakeNews versions of the truth. You auditioning for a job at #FakenewsCNN?

Wealthy people don't need tax cuts. You guys are already comfortable.
#removeGrassley #removeGrassley #removeGrassley #removeGrassley #removeGrassley #removeGrassley #removeGrassley #removeGrassley
Really Chuck? You in a dementia race with @POTUS?  Keep cutting while the deficit raises.

The taxcuts will help the people that are already doing better than ever before

Would the GOP tax plan generate a temporary growth spurt, or permanently lift the U.S. economy's trajectory? https://www.wsj.com/articles/economists-see-gop-tax-plan-producing-growth-spurt-but-split-over-long-term-effect-1507816801 …

Please REPAIR the ACA. Yes - unneeded bureaucracy & can use existing insurance industry instead. But repealing will cost lives AND $$$
@ChuckGrassley you really don't have a grasp of economics do you? Maybe read a book?
