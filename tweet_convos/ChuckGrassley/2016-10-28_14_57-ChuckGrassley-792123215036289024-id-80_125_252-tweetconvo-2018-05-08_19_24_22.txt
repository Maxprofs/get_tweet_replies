.@ChuckGrassley George Bush lost 22 million emails
ask @LinkedIn who is running their "Public Safety Team" & psychologically torturing everyone involved in this. @SecretService
it could be @Google that is issue / related "Content Selection Engine" / not @LinkedIn that needs prison time @SecretService
or a "PR / Marketing Firm" or "Police" abusing all of the tools to harass / torture people @google @LinkedIn @SecretService
politicians should do their jobs and let the FBI do theirs and bring out any wrong doings by either presidential candidate
RETIRE!! Give someone else a chance to change Iowa!
You do your job and let them do theirs. Outside of looking like a blowhard there is no net gain in you carrying on like this.
WHY WLD U SAY COMEY HAS BROKE THE LAW HE IS DOING HIS JOB HE HAD NO CHOICE NYC FBI FOUND THESE EMAILS
...@ChuckGrassley when you so readily compromise your morals for blind partisanship.
Pretty much Comey is goosestepping behind your lead. 
Your Confederate Agenda is not lost on All Americans.
Senator Grassley, We the voters, really do need transparency. Don't we? If Trump is involved with Russia - we need to know. Don't you think?
It is not "new" or "reopened", it was never closed. FBI should immediately inform the public, to hell with your briefing!

VIDEO: This is Erdogan's security goons in DC near Turkish Emb - kickin the shit out of AMERICAN protestors. Today > http://bit.ly/2pIx31a 
Sen Grassley, read your letter. Asked for update on all CLINTON @HillaryClinton. Did you forget to ask FBI info on Trump Camp link to Putin?
serious question, why do we need transparency and honesty from everyone except the GOP candidate for President?
Twenty months of investigation on Hillary's emails and what? Nothing! I want my money back!
We need Senators emails to be part of public record. Why not release your emails as a goodwill gesture.
. @ChuckGrassley is a liar. THERE IS NO NEW INVESTIGATION. Despicable. @YDanasmithdutra
---> always been a turd, but since 2008, an extremely sticky and cant get off the shoe turd
first thing you've done that I agree with. Now approve #SCOTUS
No, Chuck, what you need is a way to put the screws to #Clinton. You're not fooling anyone. #ImChuck #PutMeOnTV #ComeyMustGo
but can Iowans get some transparency as to why you won't do your job?
to busy annoucing sports
Comrade Grassley; please resign.
RU kidding me Chuckie boy!Did Ucontact Comey when he had enough 2indict corrupt Hillary?Answer,HELL no!Sk
Glad to hear someone is finally holding Comey/the Bureau to a higher level of accountability. 
#peoplewannaknow #Nov4th
Why are you piling on with the Dems? What is wrong with you? Comey IS being transparent. He wrote what he knows. Do you enjoy losing?
But no transparency on Trump and GOP working in concert with Putin's KGB to impact this election?
thank you for being a voice of reason, not taking advantage of FBIs vague  disclosure.  #DemIowan
It's been suggested that you knew about Dennis Hastert's abuse & possibly withheld info.
you should ask about FBI investigation of Trump's ties to Russia.
It makes it really hard for an honest hardworking independent Iowan like me to ever believe anything you say again....
very sad I ever voted for you. Look at your own candidate, you should be ashamed. Stop wasting tax dollars.
you're really disappointing. I wish Iowa had found someone other than Judge to run against you. #ReplaceGrassley
and from DOJ
the FBI isn't the only one we need transparency from
Who investigates the House Judiciary, which investigates the FBI?
it's not a new investigation, but a continuation of the previous one. 

Can you look into a new SCOTUS judge instead? Thanks
Can they disclose information "During" an investigation? It seems that would be worse? Things may need to be verified? #trump
oh, so you DO do stuff? I was confused for a second.
its hard to believe anything they say anymore
- All talk, no action.   A year and a half later, no answer for #FannieGate

can you ask him to be bipartisan and tell us if he's investigating Trump for the Russia hack?
Did you ask them to investigate the Senate's obstruction of the SCOTUS vacancy?
maybe they should hold a briefing when you perform your Constitutional duty and hold and up or down vote for Merrick Garland
Really Chuck? Those words are hollow coming from the democrats.
They need to have a briefing about you Grassley
Improper for you to ask for release of information prior to investigation being ready. #SCOTUSnominee could explain @ChuckGrassley @kasie
@SchreckReports Maybe you should do your job first, "senator", and after that get involved in politics. #DoYourJob
@JessicaLubien Thank you. The optics are terrible all the way around.
@1401bonniek One of the rare times I agree with the Senator. Comey has handled this poorly from the beginning.
you should schedule a hearing for the Supreme Court nominee considering ITS YOUR JOB
sounds like pics of Wiener's wiener.
SUPPORT TRUMP!VOTE TRUMP! #wikileaks #podestaemails21 #weiner #comey #email #indians #cubs #monstervote #huma #ohare #clinton
.@ChuckGrassley @SchreckReports Just another @GOP old white man using Nixon like .@FBI dirty tricks to keep power
.....Comey May Be Trying To Seal The Next #Assange Leaks !
@GOP costly #WitchHunt  Don't BULLY @HillaryClinton Bring us @realDonaldTrump IRS records #SmokeAndMirrors @BBCWorld
@kasie the FBI will get more info out when ready all the dems panties r twisted right now.
Yhoughts on @TheJusticeDept stonewalling Fed Judge Margaret Sweeney's Order  @USTreasury @FHFA Motion to Compel? #fanniegate
.@ChuckGrassley .@kasie Kasie Hunt retweeting obvious attempt to characterize this as a “new” investigation / Leads to false implications
@kasie seems like both sides finally agree on something
#Cannabull says bull
@kasie did you ask for transparency during the Primary when she competed against sanders? She called it a security review?
