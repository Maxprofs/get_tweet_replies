@ChuckGrassley Up for re-election in Nov, will you and your 23 Rep. colleagues abstain from voting for the rest of the term? Or #DoYourJob ?
@justjebus @ChuckGrassley It's not up to all of them, you really should read up on Article I, Section V of the Constitution.
@dahat 24 Rep. Sen up for election in Nov. By the logic profferred, the people should decide their fate before they vote on anything else?
@justjebus Except we've had a Senate election more recently than a Presidential election, to quote Obama: #ElectionsHaveConsequences
@dahat Right. So Grassley, Toomey and the other 22 senators were elected in '10. If Obama doesn't have a mandate, they don't. #flawedlogic
@justjebus The rotating elections make the US Senate the longest continual legislative body in history... you argument doesn't have merit.
@dahat Individuals are elected. Not the body as a whole. If pres term expires during an election year, senators up for election should too.
@justjebus The individuals are elected to the existing body, 2014 strengthened that body. As Dems in 09 said: #ElectionsHaveConsequences
@ChuckGrassley #DoYourJob. We didn't elect @POTUS for a 3 year term!
@ChuckGrassley no  you are not #DoYourJob until you act on #SCOTUS
@ChuckGrassley Your job: uphold Constitution & fill Supreme Court vacancy. You're making a mockery of your position and Iowans. #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley
@ChuckGrassley Did any of them ask you to #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley At best, you are doing part of your job.  Just not the constitutionally-mandated parts you don't like.
@ChuckGrassley do your JOB man. GOP always taughting the constitution and doing the obstruction all at the same time.
@ChuckGrassley that's nice. Now #DoYourJob and stop obstructing the President's nominee.
.@ChuckGrassley You're only doing the parts of your job you feel like doing. The rest of us would be fired for that by lunch.
@ChuckGrassley only if obstructionism is your job could you be considered doing anything.  #doyourjob or step down.
@ChuckGrassley please do the constitutionally mandated part of your job. The first draft of this tweet had much stronger language.
@ChuckGrassley No no no. #doingmyjob is to troll you until you #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley please you only work on things you want to, that's not for the people who voted for you. You are disgrace
@ChuckGrassley Obstruction is not a job. Neither is tweeting about basketball games when you're a U.S. Senator.
@ChuckGrassley a shame you're not doing all of your job. But hey, deflecting from that and hiding is more important.
.@ChuckGrassley no you are not.  #doyourjob
@ChuckGrassley No sir you are not and I can not wait for @pattyforiowa get's u voted out. ALL of Iowa & Country know you're NOT doing ur job
@ChuckGrassley if you were indeed doing your job, you wouldn't need a hash tag
@ChuckGrassley #DoYourJob and schedule hearings! Quit being a judicial obstructionist and put those judges at those benches!
@ChuckGrassley Since you are too busy handling things in the home state, resign from SCOTUS  comm so someone can #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley Throw rock Hide Hand Jokesters. I am paying $$$ to replace U
@ChuckGrassley You're a US Senator. You shouldn't need to use a hashtag to assure people you're doing your job, you silly child.
@ChuckGrassley You are paid to do ALL of You Job.
@ChuckGrassley Give us a break Grassley.  Just more Republican *!@?
If you were doing your job U wouldn't have to remind people. Do your JOB
@ChuckGrassley #really?  I have long learned to judge people by their actions, not their words.  Retract your letter, and I will believe you
@ChuckGrassley do your job fill the vacancy
@ChuckGrassley is this an example of you doing your job?
@ChuckGrassley this is an example of when you were actually doing your job #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley No you aren't.  If you did things would actually get fixed in this country.  What you are doing is #FuckAll
@ChuckGrassley saying that you're doing your job is not the same as actually doing you job. #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley That's not doing your job that's just pretending to be productive. #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley Your response is that you worked for one hour?  #DoYourJob Senator.  Stop embarrassing us Iowans.
@ChuckGrassley I'd get fired if I didn't do what is required of me. Confirm a new SCOTUS asap, because my vote still counts! #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley No one works harder then you do to support and represent the people of Iowa! #99counties
@ChuckGrassley Do YOUR JOB and open the committer for a SC nominee.  No pay until you do should be the rule.
@ChuckGrassley  When the shit hits the fan here, chuck you will be held accountable, we will not forget.
@ChuckGrassley stumping for re-election is not "doing your job." You've become a disgrace to the state of Iowa.
@ChuckGrassley #doyourjob
@ChuckGrassley Not doing your Job Chuck.
@ChuckGrassley it's funny, because I'll be #doingmyjob to get you that retirement package in November. You don't represent me.
@Anomaly100 @ChuckGrassley Probably stuck in the dream of being a loyal minion to Dear Supreme Leader Trump
@ChuckGrassley What have you done to raise the min wage today?? What have you done to get $$$ out of politics today? #DoYourJob
#obstructionist @ChuckGrassley
@ChuckGrassley must have a shiny new constitution, because in the one I've read a "tele town hall" isn't mentioned anywhere. #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley no you're not hold hearings on the new Supreme Court Justice the people of Iowa have voted on you to do that. Or quit !!
@ChuckGrassley <<== if you won't #DoYourJob then #Iowans should take the job away from you
@ChuckGrassley Then fill the vacancy douche bag.
@ChuckGrassley how many of them were under 80?
Chuck please put a space in your Twitter handle. My family is dying @ChuckGrassley
@ChuckGrassley isn't your job the head of the Judiciary Committee?  I hear that committee is dysfunctional #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley this sounds more like campaigning than the actual job #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley You sir, are defiantly NOT doing your job.
@ChuckGrassley The Constitution protects us from  tyrannical politicians who put their respective agendas before the good of the nation.
@ChuckGrassley that's called "trying to keep my job, but not doing any work."
@ChuckGrassley  Keep selling it Senator.  Iowans will let you know what we think in November.  #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley #noyou'renot
@ChuckGrassley please don't let this moron incumbent nominate anyone
@ChuckGrassley Do your job on the Judiciary Committee too.
Go @ChuckGrassley ! Next time try some Qs that aren't planted!! #DoYourJob--SCOTUS for this POTUS now!
@ChuckGrassley don't understand the logic of refusing do your job when history of others in the same situation doing theirs #doyourjob
@ChuckGrassley like the new hashtag.  I bet it's driving some folks nuts! :-)
Hope you'll come around to support Trump soon. I thnk he cares
@ChuckGrassley isn't your job to also hold Scotus confirmation hearings?
@ChuckGrassley 
#DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley #DoALLofyourjob
@DemoFacts @Thom_Hartmann @ChuckGrassley That's okay. If the Republicans hold it up, Hillary can nominate Michelle Obama.
@ChuckGrassley next up I assume you'll stop stalling judicial appointments. #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley #doingmyjob? No you're not. Your job is to uphold the constitution.
@ChuckGrassley Fill the vacancy
@ChuckGrassley #DOYOURJOB
