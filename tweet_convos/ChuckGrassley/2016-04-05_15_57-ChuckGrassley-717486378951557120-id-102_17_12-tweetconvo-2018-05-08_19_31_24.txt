@ChuckGrassley Today: Old worn out senator pisses away taxpayer money while managing to avoid doing his job of hearing a new SCOTUS nominee.
@ChuckGrassley legalize it. That's what we (your voters) want.
@ChuckGrassley Weed? Not the biggest prob. Broken political system is. #DoYourJob
. @ChuckGrassley You make it a problem by clinging to outdated racist drug laws. What damage has it caused other than $ spent on enforcement
@ChuckGrassley What special funding and tax increase have you proposed to execute increased DOJ investigations of said MJ leaving?
@ChuckGrassley You Iowans are just jealous that you are not making all the $ CO is making Pot legal not filling up jails with regular people
@ChuckGrassley Politicians sucking on the taxpayers teat for 6 decades and denying sick people their medication are a big problem in IA.
Dear @ChuckGrassley please allow a #cannabis educator open your eyes to the wonders of #medical #cannabis + #safe  #recreational usage
@ChuckGrassley I remember him saying Feds will stay out. That's what republicans say they want. Go do your job. You got elected & get paid
@ChuckGrassley Get on board w/ MJ legalization before the revenue tapers it's 100% a non-issue. - Iowan and current Denver resident
@ChuckGrassley Just made another donation to Patty Judge. #DoYourJob
Today: @ChuckGrassley still refuses to do his job. Biggest problem we have in the state. #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley it's only a big problem because you're too close minded to realize this is a plant that helps people. Period.
@ChuckGrassley do your job. Hold a SCOTUS hearing and vote. Yea or Nay I don't care just hold the hearing and do your job by casting a vote.
@ChuckGrassley "We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee"
@DoremusJ @ChuckGrassley too soon
@That_Fing_Cat I thought of that tweet I sent yesterday when I heard the news today #synchronicity
@ChuckGrassley Now is not the time to talk about marijuana.
@ChuckGrassley haha. It super isn't also #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley I say legalize and tax it at 100% as a luxury, and while your at it increase the tax on alchohol too. Pay down the deficit.
@ChuckGrassley Obama intends to replace Americans with foreigners.  Drugging Americans with marijuana, heroin, etc. speeds up that process!
@ChuckGrassley as soon as the lobbyists from the industry start paying you. You'll be all for it. Do your job!
@ChuckGrassley who are you to perpetuate the incarnation of 35,000 peaceful people each year?
@ChuckGrassley judicial committee not doing its duty by giving nominee for SCOTUS a hearing. #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley any chance of having a FAIR & balanced hearing? One-sided rhetoric is one reason congress is regarded as a joke
@ChuckGrassley You're behind the times.  Problem in Iowa are Gov B's broken medical cannabis law and not making #naloxone  available 4 OD's
@ChuckGrassley funny you jab obama about promises as you refuse to #doyourjob. Your stance on weed is out of touch with voters. #termlimits
@ChuckGrassley haha
@ChuckGrassley you're losing me Chuck. Pot should be decriminalized. It's a crop so really to follow suit it should also be subsidized.
@ChuckGrassley But is it a big problem in Iowa? Is it a problem at all?
@ChuckGrassley thanx chuck im Gettin ready 
To make your sheriff posse into my insane 
Clown posse. #doggystyle resistance is futile
#Ripone
@ChuckGrassley @POTUS did you make
Chuck a secret promise.....this is a lame
Duck year wow man all my money went
Up in smoke #scapegoat bock
@ChuckGrassley Funny that you tweet about POTUS not doing his job when you're not doing yours #DoYourJob #firegrassley
@ChuckGrassley have a drink and drive home with all the other Iowa drunks who think booze is safer than marijuana.
@ChuckGrassley Pot will be less of a 'problem' in IA when it's inevitably legalized. Do you support putting people in jail for that?
@ChuckGrassley "No talent Assclown", #doyourjob
@ChuckGrassley the biggest problem in Iowa is reefer mad fools like you playing God #SaferThanAlcohol #SaferThanFDAdope #FireLukan
@ChuckGrassley hold a hearing for SCOTUS nominee. #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley Falling for "reefer madness" chuck? Heroin & opioids much bigger problem in Iowa. You have no clue...
@ChuckGrassley good
@ChuckGrassley you hosted a taxpayer-funded scam job.
@ChuckGrassley nothing new with that
@ChuckGrassley   It's a plant. BTW #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley the pot or you?
@ChuckGrassley Stop wasting time and #DoYourJob.
@ChuckGrassley Your not doing your job Chuck! Bring people to the table and talk about #SCOTUS
@ChuckGrassley you will be fondly remembered as the Biggest Obstructionist Doing more harm to Not only the State But the Country. Period
@ChuckGrassley - Speaking of "not doing what they promised," how's that SCOTUS nomination hearing coming?
@ChuckGrassley Why, is their weed better Chuck?
@ChuckGrassley The gate way drugs in order; sugar, nicotine, liquor. Bigger fish to fry.
@ChuckGrassley its only a big problem for people living in the past. Just legalize it.
@ChuckGrassley The Obama DOJ should be prosecuting you for being bought at the expense of America's kidney function.  #UESWLFraud
@ChuckGrassley you're the big problem in Iowa here in muscatine @Deanofcomedy @MSNBCRachel
@ChuckGrassley When you figure out how to make more $ off of legalization than the War on Drugs I bet you'll change your song.
@ChuckGrassley you won't give consent to appoint a SCJ but you're worried about weed.
@ChuckGrassley but the state legalized it. Shouldn't we respect?
@ChuckGrassley Sure way not to get re-elected!
@ChuckGrassley retire
@ChuckGrassley How about you leave your sham hearings to whoever the people vote in this fall.  #grassleyisondrugs
“@ChuckGrassley: Drug caucus, prosecute marijuana leaving CO. problem in Iowa??? ”#DoYourJob Are you high, leave Colorado alone #SCOTUS nom
@ChuckGrassley such a whiner #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley and you Mr. Grassley are not doing what you "promised" to do. Do your job. #SCOTUSnominee
@ChuckGrassley Go back to Iowa and farm some families.
@jayjohncos @chuckgrassley Chuck, you are unfit to serve. I will be voting for anyone but you this November in Iowa. #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley YOU'RE THE ONE HOLDING UP THE BILL IN COMMITTEE THAT WOULD FIX THIS PROBLEM, IDIOT. Srsly, stop complaining at ur own mess
@ChuckGrassley What have YOU done about Grassley????
Just blaming on others won't help your credibility, Grassley!!!
@ChuckGrassley Your "hot button" argument was a mess. You are a mess. You should resign your chair until voters decide. #DoYourJob #Resign
@ChuckGrassley Too funny that you're upset about Government not doing its job. SCOTUS #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley  DO YOUR JOB FAKE FARMER .
@ChuckGrassley nobody from Colorado ever wants to go to Iowa, chuck
@ChuckGrassley this may be a self regulating problem you have on your hands
@ChuckGrassley <<== Not doing his job as a Senator #DoYourJob
@ChuckGrassley you're a disgusting human. Please resign and then eat  and die
@ChuckGrassley yea screw states rights
@ChuckGrassley ;  Teenage girls are having kids with their drug dealers or pimps. Epidemic problem across the country.
@CDaeda @ChuckGrassley I agree! If we legalize they will shop @ licensed regulated stores instead of fallin for their weed man! Legalize it!
@ChuckGrassley Believe me, I'm no Obama supporter but he has this one half right.  Leave it be or decriminalize it.  Don't step backwards.
@ChuckGrassley Stop catering to big pharma and actually listen to what your constituents have to say.
@ChuckGrassley FFS Chuck, even alcohol is more harmful than MJ but we have no problems with that being legal.  It's 2016, wake up.
@ChuckGrassley okay daddy
@ChuckGrassley Why the problem with mj but the fed approves oxy for kids?  NVM the meth issues we have.  MJ is the least of the worries.
@ChuckGrassley 52 opioid deaths in IA in 2014, JAMA article suggests that could have been 25% lower w/medical cannabis. #TimeForCARERS
@ChuckGrassley Marijuana is not a problem. Read sometime and get some facts not born out of the Reefer Madness propaganda.
@ChuckGrassley you are so out of touch with reality it's sad. Prohibition has never worked. Time will prove you wrong sooner than later
@ChuckGrassley half your state is on Heroin/Oxy/Meth and you're crying about a little Marijuana leaving Colorado. Go watch some volleyball
@ChuckGrassley u like weed dont u
@ChuckGrassley @suckONdeezRUTZ translate please
@chadlowman @ChuckGrassley lol chuck maybe say pot or marijuana less so people can understand what you mean
@ChuckGrassley chuck grass ley
@ChuckGrassley A better solution, than locking people up or otherwise giving them criminal records, would be to adopt the CO, WA model.
@ChuckGrassley it's a waste of money and resources to prosecute.
@ChuckGrassley nobody likes a narc chuck
