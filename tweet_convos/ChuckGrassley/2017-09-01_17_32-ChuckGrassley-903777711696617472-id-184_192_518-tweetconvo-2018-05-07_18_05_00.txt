Wonder how much Russian money he took? There goes the Senate Investigation...

Do you realize how many people in Iowa will be impacted if Trump ends DACA- Chuck, you need to grow a spine.
We are watching you Grassley. We seen 45's bribe to you. Do what is right & stop trying to squash/interfere with investigation. #TrumpRussia
Wish Iowans had a voice for healthcare and against tax cuts for the rich
@GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @HouseJudiciary @senjudiciary @HouseIntelComm @WhiteHouse @Cabinet
If you need help with Awans prosecutors- Please get in contact with this Marine
Perhaps you should listen to CEO of Cargill about the impact on Iowa Agriculture with the dismantling of all of our trade agreements.
Yes, POTUS will pardon U for your part in obstructing justice, but remember, a pardon is an admission of guilt! Is that the legacy you want?
Question To US Citizens
Do US Citizen's Children Come Before Illegals
Should DACA/Illegals Pay Less For College Our-Of State Tuition Fees
And the other: this one has already rallied opposition. 1/
I want all transcripts public or public testimony. Iowa favors for undermining justice. 2/2
US dividing Mexican families  Came here 4 freebies leaving families behind-send them $ Now we can let them go home
See Chuck it is time to do the right thing and get rid of Trump. It is Move for #Impeachment - Nothing else matters. He is dangerous

POTUS bribes you and you go softball with his kid. Wow. Be proud, Iowa.
Nice!!! Northey rocks
Thank you for accepting & loving our President the way millions of Americans do! You & he are the BEST! #MAGA
Everybody had a price!! You seemed to come pretty cheap!
We see how you're trying to get cozy with trump...poor move.

Grassley refuses to comment about his phone call with Trump, won't say if it was appropriate for president to call him amid investigation
Have you and Trump made a dirty bargain--ethanol subsidies for going easy on Don Jr? Beware. Trump defiles everyone
Legal expert: Timing of Trump-Grassley call raises concerns, esp. considering Trump's behavior with investigators.

Please do not sell your soul for trump . He will not be in office for long . Choose representation over corruption 
I had never seen this picture! These are vile creatures!!


Your allegiance is to this Country, not crazy POTUS or GOP--gonna vote you out of office...
Did you take any more bribes 2 say this or was this part of the first bribe deal 2 botch the Senate investigation?
Where r transcripts?
Pretty awful
Hey tweeps, some @GOP are standing up for #DACA. Not @ChuckGrassley. Let him know how you feel about that. https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/as-gop-rallies-around-daca-grassley-sows-doubts-about-its-integrity/2017/09/01/1c97b23a-8f55-11e7-91d5-ab4e4bb76a3a_story.html …
So we can working to improve sustainable agriculture with his departure? Awesome.
Nobody of conscience would work under Trump.

This is what makes some Republican senators look so bad. Any attempts to aid Trump's coverup efforts will forever tarnish their legacies. https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/903725509430870016 …
Grassley talks from both sides of his mounth.  We all know Grassley is a Huge Trump supporter
How many more gifts is @realDonaldTrump going to give you so you go easy on his son & the rest of the Russia conspiracy investigation? 1.
First out of the blue support for ethanol and now this. He's bribing you in plain sight. 2.
You appear to think we're too dumb to see it, or don't care that we can. If you're not deplorable, you're sure deplorable-adjacent. 3/3
Hey, Chuck, one of your relatives was my high school teacher in Houston, TX. Support DACA, please! Also, stop helping Trump's legal team.
See below re: your tax cuts for the rich and corporations.
As corporate profits surge, wages of American workers have stalled for the fifth consecutive month. No more of this trickle down nonsense. https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/903599306615246848 …
What are you doing for Trump to "repay" him for favors to you and your state??? Watch out. Consequences could be damaging.
You seem to be cheering for Trump a lot. That ethanol promise/call he made is working. Let's see how u handle his son if u sold your soul
While an iowa education may not be what it once was, we are not yet so stupid we don't know quid pro quo when it smacks us in the face.
Yup, Trump bought you.
Yeah, we see what's going on. This opens up an opportunity for your grandson. You are as crooked as Trump.
I wonder why you don’t like DREAMers
So that's the pay off. Chuck be careful of your bedfellows
Curious timeline Trump called abt Ethanol You made up Comey/Clinton Trump yapping Comey/Clinton.  REally how you want 2b rememered Paid for?
BTW do you know the punishment for treason?
You're a crook. Why would you cover for treason. Hope you go down too
How is it possible to tweet when your head is up Trump's ass?

It appears that Comey was letting Hillary off the hook months before the investigation was even finished. He should have been fired then.
Awww congrats @BNorthey !!!
Sad
You're a POS for not doing your job, Chucky!
Taking bribes from tRUmp?
Mueller gonna be knocking at your door.
Time to retire?
I think yes!
I duntoi undersTand yOuv
So trump calls you to support ethanol and you switch your focus from the Russia investigation back to Clinton..shame #CorruptionGOP
.Senator I see that trumps bribe (support for ethanol) worked. Shame on you
Make sure you don't get carried with that and destroy the LEGACY you have built all this years.
I'd say he already has.
Is that because you're a total sellout? Yay you!
Say "Ag" one more time...
Dirty Politician. In JUDICIAL Committee! We don't need no stinkin' laws anymore....or ethics. We'll follow our leaders in lawlessness.
Wow, Google your name and all you see are reports / questions about the phone call and intent to influence Jud. Comm. re: Donald Jr.. 1/
This sweetens the deal. I did appraise Ethics Comm. members & others ... sure they can't have missed all this. Another obstruction effort. 2
we are on to u sir. Do what is right for this country. I see you
Care to commitment on the timing? Stop playing politics with trump and begin to serve the people or find a new job!
Why would anyone with half a brain join the Trumptanic sh*t show? Career killer for sure!
Have you reported that phone call about ethanol to the FBI and Mueller yet?  We are watching.
Wont be AG if he has to go thru the confirm process in disgraceful Senate! How many of Trumps nominees are waiting while Senate stalls!!!SAD
Trump is kissing Grassley's ass.   Why?  Hmmmmmm.  Russia?
trump has been wearing that sweet hat everywhere. is it for sale? what about his steaks and water? does he market his own tanning lotion?
congratz!
Both pathetic and transparent, watching corrupt potus play you like a fiddle.
This is what makes some Republican senators look so bad. Any attempts to aid Trump's coverup efforts will forever tarnish their legacies. https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/903725509430870016 …
And you don't see you are being bought off? So sad.
Yeah, the big get bigger. Nothing like having a yes man in there. You should have retired years ago Chuck.  You do absolutely nothing for IA
Another traitor? Seems like whoever joins @realDonaldTrump  team forgets who they are supposed to be looking out for.
And what does @realDonaldTrump get in return? Is the racist Sam Clovis still up for a job he's not remotely qualified for?
What about Sam Clovis? He's another stand up guy.

Is this what he said he would give you when he called the other day to get you to back off of #TrumPutin investigation?..?

U have no idea how dangerous the Awan brothers R to this country they have all your info including yours&Wasserman Schultz&Podesta did it.
Jeez that must be some ethanol deal.
Well that is the quo for Grassley speaking out about Comey. We knew something was in the works.
Not a bit obvious. 
John Podesta& Wasserman Schultz let the Awan brothers take a lot of classified info to give to Muslim brotherhood in exchange 4 Wet Work!
We love Bill!!! Got our turkey  leg from him this year at #iowastatefair He's a straight shooter.
Another buy out from Trump, Sen?  So now will grandson Pat get Northy's job on his own way up the ladder?  How was Don Jr's testimony?
What are you doing about the Awan Case with the US Attorney Spy ring in Congress.#Awan Comey, @DWStweets @jeffsessions
Trump slowly making you obliging to him.
Was that part of the ethanol deal?  Collude much?  #Complicit
You need to be in DC working on Trump's Impeachment! Trump is a Traitor Russia did Cyber War against the USA With Trump's Help!

Another senator bought by the #POTUS
I'm sure there's a lot of BS involved in this deal
Mexico will boycott US corn if Congress doesn't stand up to Trump about his wall.
America will boycott Iowa corn... but you grow feed don't you?
I know so many people who are getting to sue congress for allowing Robert Mueller to frame the POTUS over a lie the last admin made up!Watch
"IT appears" You made your statement to deflect from Comey/Trump letter. FAILED. Pick your cherry tree. Traitor.
Russia never hacked the DNC&Mueller must be fired at once&Arrested 4 treason against a sitting POTUS along with Clinton,Obama&Team!
Do U have any idea how many Americans R going to bring lawsuits against Congress 4 allowing Mueller to waste millions of our tax$ over a lie
I'm worried about DACA Chuck. It needs to go.
Wow. All it took for Donald Trump to buy your support to obstruct the Mueller investigation was to float some ethanol promises? Pathetic.
As fuel is 10%ethanol, so too this deal, took 10% of a soul
Trump has the evidence that Russia never hacked the DNC&Clinton&Obama had everyone go along with the lie.Mueller needs to be fired at once!
Americans are outraged that Clinton,Comey,lynch,Podesta,Obama,Brennan,Clapper,Rice,McCabe,McCain are not in prison 4 treason against POTUS!
J. Comey was paid millions to let Clinton off email case&To frame Trump w/Fake Russia hacking&After being fired brought in Mueller 2 finish!
Crooked Grassley loves jerking Trump Off
But does he wash his hands after he is finished?
after you let #dontheconjr off, maybe potus will get you a job and we can get someone who supports Iowa in D.C. whattayathink?
O gawd what horrible thing has this guy done. Trump has a tendency to pick people to spite America
Sad that trump will boondoggle our farmers and ruin the economy
James Comey covered 4 Clinton,obama&Team 4 years including the murder of Seth Rich&Going along with the fake Russia hacking lie!
Well at least IA will have a chance for a better Sec of AG.
That's great Chuck. Can you now please help @realDonaldTrump  drain the swamp??
Sold out big time, didn't you @ChuckGrassley
Remember not to give favors in your committee. We r all watching
POTUS piles on the bribes of @ChuckGrassley 

@wsj @DMRegister @washingtonpost @nytimes @maddow @CBSNews @ABC

Good choice Senator Grassley! Thank you. #MAGA
What are you gonna do to Comey for letting off Hillary before investigation was through he lied to Congress
Are you seriously not seeing the underbelly of this?!
Iowa should be ashamed to send any of its citizens to this corrupt administration
Corruption Obama administration
in exchange for  softball questioning of Jr?
Chuck, did Mueller give Comey immunity already?
You are soooooo gullible. He is protecting his kid and you are falling for it. Wow, that's SAD!
