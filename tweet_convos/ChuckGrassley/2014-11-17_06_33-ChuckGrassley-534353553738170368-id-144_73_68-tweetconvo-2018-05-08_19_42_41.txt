@ChuckGrassley Washington also advised the US to stay out of foreign entanglements so as to preserve the Republic. How about that, Senator?
@Kut_s_chera Washington would likely be displeased by the undeclared war the US is currently waging, as it's not in the national interest
@Kut_s_chera Yes -- it is both illegal *and* outside the national interest. There is no national interest in waging war against ISIS.
@Kut_s_chera I agree that they're separate arguments. I think that waging war against ISIS is bad policy, and undermines US interests.
.@ChuckGrassley Typical GOP leader appealing to emotion, hoping his constituency are complete morons to buy his agenda. Have you #NoShame?
@ChuckGrassley So if you follow God like GW, you have to own slaves like GW?  Are you fucking high?
@ChuckGrassley Washington never said that.
http://www.mountvernon.org/research-collections/digital-encyclopedia/article/spurious-quotations/ …
@ChuckGrassley Sorry but Washington never said that.
@ChuckGrassley It is impossible to rightly govern the world w/o checking your sources and studying your history
@ChuckGrassley This is not even true, he did not say this. Glad to see that you've already been busted lying about this quote by others.
@ChuckGrassley bruh bruh, that quote is fake. sorry to burst your bubble
@ChuckGrassley lets try anyway
@ChuckGrassley It's been up for two days -- and the fool hasn't taken it down yet?  Yer a joke.  Count on being heckled over this.
@ChuckGrassley You realize you represent people who don't participate in your religion right? Shame on you for isolating them.
@ChuckGrassley I love this country, but #GeorgeWashingtonNeverSaidThat.
@ChuckGrassley Nice dog whistle. Facts don't matter when you have a dog whistle do they?
@ChuckGrassley @AnthraxJones I think that's a Craig T. Nelson quote.
@ChuckGrassley stop trolling senator , have some respect for yourself.
@ChuckGrassley I really would like to see this from your point of view, but I can't get my head that far up my own ass.
@ChuckGrassley George Washington never said that http://www.mountvernon.org/research-collections/digital-encyclopedia/article/spurious-quotations/ …
@ChuckGrassley Chuck, what's your take on Interstellar?
@ChuckGrassley no he didn't
.@ChuckGrassley no he didn't. also, god is not real.
Reply to @ChuckGrassley No he didn't
@ChuckGrassley Iowans: heed Sen Grassley and Pres Washington! We need biblical principles!
@lindaschmidt12 @ChuckGrassley except Washington never said that.
@ChuckGrassley Does that have anything to do with why the current Republican slugs in office haven't done anything worthwhile in years? No!
@chuckgrassley Also, are you insinuating that we should own slaves because GeoWashington did? Our world is different than his.
@ChuckGrassley Any plans to walk back spurious quote?  After all, Lincoln said, "If u love America u hv 2 appreciate historical accuracy."
@ChuckGrassley "never believe anything you read on the internet" ~abraham lincoln
@ChuckGrassley @Jacob_Pharaoh Chuck Grassley should be in the Library of Congress as an example of unintentional hilariousness
@ChuckGrassley man up and admit you were wrong. GW never said that.
@ChuckGrassley Actually he did not say that.  http://www.mountvernon.org/research-collections/digital-encyclopedia/article/spurious-quotations/ …
@chuckgrassley Sorry Chuck. It's a false quote.. http://www.mountvernon.org/research-collections/digital-encyclopedia/article/spurious-quotations/ …
Ha! And they say Republicans don't lie. Add another to the list. @ChuckGrassley
@ChuckGrassley Please don't misquote our first POTUS to further your twisted agenda
@ChuckGrassley  "Always drink your Ovaltine." - Geo. Washington
@ChuckGrassley GeoWash never averred that, Chuck.  http://www.amazon.com/They-Never-Said-Misleading-Attributions/dp/0195064690 …
@ChuckGrassley you could be the poster-boy for term limits.
@ChuckGrassley You have to appreciate Ben Franklin who said "It's easier to represent assholes when you have your head firmly up your ass."
@ChuckGrassley even @MountVernon has shown this to be spurious. Please stick to truth when governing, if it's not too much to ask.
@ChuckGrassley What happened to the guy who fought against 200 dollar hammers?  I've seen bags of nails brighter than you.  You're pathetic.
@ChuckGrassley @AdamSerwer What part of the bible did he use to justify his slave ownership?
@ChuckGrassley Google is your friend. A US Senator choosing to purposely misquote the founding fathers is unseemly and embarrassing. Stop.
@ChuckGrassley looking at your responses I'm guessing you got this one wrong
@ChuckGrassley Your staff needs someone who is more skilled at Googling.
Um, no: http://www.mountvernon.org/research-collections/digital-encyclopedia/article/spurious-quotations/ … MT @ChuckGrassley: Washington averred that"It's impossible to rightly govern the world w/o God and the Bible"
@YAppelbaum Remarkably, I heard Governor McDonnell use that very same misquote at a speech that he gave...at Mount Vernon.
.@ChuckGrassley @AdamSerwer Washington also viciously yanked his slaves' teeth to insert in his own mouth.  #GodAndBible
@ChuckGrassley "Don't believe everything you read on the internet" - Abraham Lincoln #getrealdude
@ChuckGrassley "The internet is srs bsns" -Abraham Lincoln
@ChuckGrassley Nope; he never said that: http://www.mountvernon.org/research-collections/digital-encyclopedia/article/spurious-quotations/ … So, do you have enough Christian integrity to issue a retraction?
@ChuckGrassley As usual u don't kno wat ur talkin bout cuz u don't take time2 research ur info. Ur callous towards low income peeps. Hypocri
.@ChuckGrassley   Source, please?
@ChuckGrassley And some Muslims say it's impossible to rightly govern the world without Allah and the Quran. Both statements bullshit.
@ChuckGrassley if you love America, just ignore #chuckgrassley
@ChuckGrassley Chuckie, perhaps you should hire some better researchers. Hire some atheists. We love research and truth.
@ChuckGrassley There is no proof he said this. Founding Fathers were deists, not Christians. USA is not a theocracy like Islam.
@ChuckGrassley My BS meter is off the scale (again).
@ChuckGrassley George Washington would slap you from grave for putting ignorant words in his mouth... Who votes for these jokers?
"I hate the First Amendment, its supporters, and correctly attributed quotations." -@ChuckGrassley
@ChuckGrassley It's fun to just make things up and pretend they are facts.
@ChuckGrassley takeapage from your own fantasy book.A false witness will not go unpunished, And he who speaks lies shall perish"Proverbs19:9
@ChuckGrassley That quote is as much of a fraud as you are Senator...please retire not only for yourself, but for those you "represent."
.@ChuckGrassley Washington never said that.
@ChuckGrassley he never said that. He helped create a secular government. So I do appreciate him.
@ChuckGrassley Ummmm, what? 42 people are clearly as dumb as you are. Either that or as dishonest. Conservatives just love to hate facts.
@ChuckGrassley Thank you for underscoring exactly why you aren't qualified to govern in any capacity in this nation. You're a disgrace.
@ChuckGrassley Except that he never averred that: http://www.mountvernon.org/research-collections/digital-encyclopedia/article/spurious-quotations/ … #factcheck #deistfoundingfathers @hemantmehta
@ChuckGrassley He never said that. Please do some research and issue a retraction. http://www.mountvernon.org/research-collections/digital-encyclopedia/article/spurious-quotations/ …
@ChuckGrassley He never said that. Fool !
@ChuckGrassley At least we don't have to appreciate GOP senators who tweet fictitious quotes. http://www.mountvernon.org/research-collections/digital-encyclopedia/article/spurious-quotations/ …
@ChuckGrassley Except that he never said anything of the sort. Facts are inconvenient, aren't they?
@ChuckGrassley You know Washington didn't say that, yet you continue to repeat it. What does that make you?
@ChuckGrassley 

Nope - your assertion is false, and probably intentionally so.

Damn the truth, eh???

@corvetteBeth
@ChuckGrassley Jesus, kind of an important thing to be perfectly wrong about, innit?
@ChuckGrassley  Ever heard of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson??? 
Leave George Washington alone, Big-Boy!!!  Take your MEDS everyday...
.@ChuckGrassley Chuck didn't start the fire. It was always burning since his #PantsBURNLegWound'in'.
@ChuckGrassley @corvetteBeth No he didn’t. http://www.religioustolerance.org/badquotes.htm 
@ChuckGrassley chuck....this goes against the very first amendment, chuck. Chuck. Hello, chuck? You dead man? CHUUUUUUUUUUCK
@ChuckGrassley NICE FAKE QUOTE YOU DRUNKEN ASSHOLE
@ChuckGrassley is this a parody account?
@ChuckGrassley Oh it turns out that you're wrong anyway. How strange, that never happens!
@ChuckGrassley And yet he didn't make any official state religion. Huh.
R u real @ChuckGrassley
Oh he's all-too-real, @And_truuuuuu
@ChuckGrassley you silly silly man
@ChuckGrassley Abraham Lincoln wrote that people who over-abbreviate on Twitter should be denied the franchise, or possibly euthanized.
@ChuckGrassley 

"80% of the quotes you see on the Internet are made up." 

- George Washington
@ChuckGrassley cool. Just make shit up. Have fun you crazy old idiot
.@ChuckGrassley no, he never said that.
@ChuckGrassley @MattBinder I love America, but at least I don't make up George Washington quotes. #respectsisearn
@ChuckGrassley @MattBinder even if he said it or something like it, doesn't make it true. Stop appealing to have religion in govt, please.
@ChuckGrassley this quote is True and Real, like God. thank you, Senator
LOL @virgiltexas
@ChuckGrassley I heard he said that as he rode his Tauntaun into battle against the Death Star.Or was it during the battle of Mount Doom?
@beccaali "MtDm is a gr8 plase to vst and Tawntawns were nvr on 
noahes ark please read ur bbl."
@ChuckGrassley next time check with me before you tweet out a fake George Washington Quote
@ChuckGrassley Your attributed quote is about as real as the "George Washington Chopped Down A Cherry Tree" tale... #HatchetJob #False
@ChuckGrassley George Washington never said that. And you're a disgrace to your office.
@ChuckGrassley @MattBinder except for how he didn't. Except for how this country was founded on SEPARATION of church and state. But okay.
@ChuckGrassley How you continue to get re elected blows my mind.
to be fair, it's not senator @chuckgrassley's fault he doesn't know his historical facts. they rarely show History on the History Channel.
@mattbinder @chuckgrassley History Channel is the new MTV
@ChuckGrassley @MattBinder so glad someone so horribly misinformed is in a position of power. yay america!
Dont listn to hatrs Chuck! Gge Washingtn said that in Bible and thts a Fact  everything in is Fact @ChuckGrassley
@ChuckGrassley @MattBinder No he didn't say that. http://www.mountvernon.org/research-collections/digital-encyclopedia/article/spurious-quotations/ …
@ChuckGrassley You, sir, are batshit crazy.
@inhouseradio @corvetteBeth @ChuckGrassley Don’t call Chuckie a sir.  He is a redneck who has been the senate far too long.
@ChuckGrassley @MattBinder Well, I guess that leaves out a lot of people.
.@ChuckGrassley @MattBinder if you love America, tell @ChuckGrassley to learn his fucking history before he opens his mouth.
@JBogeman2 @ChuckGrassley @MattBinder Agreed. I love USA n apprec comment (if real) as reminder how stupid our society was back then.
@ChuckGrassley And you prove that it is impossible to rightly govern when you're fooled by fictitious "quotes."
it is good that a U.S. senator is citing a fake quote falsely attributed to the nation's first president @chuckgrassley
@MattBinder ilu matt ijs.
@ChuckGrassley how about a dictionary
@ChuckGrassley ALL HAIL GEO-WASHINGTON
@ChuckGrassley Which is worse... your child - like abbreviations or your blatant disregard for facts?
.@ChuckGrassley just trolling us all at this point:
If u love America u hv to appreciate GeoWashington He once averred that"It is impossible to rightly govern the world w/o God and the Bible".
@ChuckGrassley His best quote was "don't believe everything you read on the internet"...
@KWierso @ChuckGrassley Don't fabricate more quotes. Everyone knows Abe Lincoln was the one who said that.
@ChuckGrassley Good people can exist without religion as much as they can with it.
@ChuckGrassley I also love separation of church and state. Dude... Cmon
@ChuckGrassley Perhaps we need to remind the USSC of that. They have also forgotten that the CONSTITUTION (not case law) is basis of our law
@ChuckGrassley Face, meet palm.
If u love America u hv to appreciate GeoWashington He once averred that"It is impossible to rightly govern the world w/o God and the Bible".
@ChuckGrassley What about the separation of church and state? Why should I be forced to follow laws shaped by your religious beliefs?
@ChuckGrassley That is a made up quote. If you love america, you don't make up quotes by the founding fathers.
@ChuckGrassley Keep your Bible and others out of our government!  Why do you need it, you care nothing for humanity, just use it to control.
@politicsunspun @corvetteBeth @ChuckGrassley Grassley shares his Bible with the idiot Joni Ernst who also carries a gun in her purse.
@ChuckGrassley if u lv America u will either resign or start typing cogent tweets.
@ChuckGrassley Good to appreciate GW, but not for false quote. You may want to research this one.  #grassley http://www.mountvernon.org/research-collections/digital-encyclopedia/article/spurious-quotations/ …
PantsBurnLegWound @ChuckGrassley
I love how you butcher English to get to 140 characters but still use words like 'averred' instead of 'said' @ChuckGrassley
@ChuckGrassley Historic 1st use of "u" as a word & "averred" in the same sentence. Congratulations.
Literally took me 12 seconds to Google this not being true http://www.mountvernon.org/research-collections/digital-encyclopedia/article/spurious-quotations/ … @ChuckGrassley
@ericmichel @ChuckGrassley We don'1 need ur fancy goolges in IOWA!
@ChuckGrassley he never said that tho chuck
@ChuckGrassley why does GOP love misquoting the founding fathers so much? To justify their un-American policies?
@ChuckGrassley also, compromised on slavery
No, @ChuckGrassley, George Washington never said that. Stop spreading falsehoods. http://www.religioustolerance.org/badquotes.htm  #p2 #topprog #DEM #tlot #GOP
@ChuckGrassley Bad quote that is not true. Also, he owned slaves. Does that make it OK today too?
@chuckgrassley He actually didn't say that, Chuck.
Assume deer dead @ChuckGrassley
