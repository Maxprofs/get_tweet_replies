@SenatorReid how about you work on getting people jobs instead of benefits. Jobs grow the economy, welfare does not. #uniteblue #tyranny
@BilliTheGoat @SenatorReid UI is not welfare. It is insurance paid into during employment to cover a period of unemployment. #RenewUI
@dorriecoon @SenatorReid so why is Harry trying to increase benefits if it's a private insurance policy?
@BilliTheGoat @SenatorReid he is not trying to increase them. He is trying to get them up and running again. Kinda like flood ins. #RenewUI
@dorriecoon @SenatorReid what does the government have to "get up and running"? It sounds like UI is just private funds put away
@BilliTheGoat  just like flood ins. the gov't backs payouts beyond 26 wks. It was deducted from every one of my paychecks. #RenewUI
@dorriecoon so when you say they're trying to reinstate them, when did the government stop paying? And where did all that money go?
@BilliTheGoat the gov't stopped paying Dec 31st. Just like farm bill & flood ins they are battling over politics. #RenewUI is overdue.
.@SenatorReid: How about you work on getting Americans #JOBS! 

#tgdn #tcot
@DorothyGrissom @SenatorReid That's a new one for Reid. I don't think he's thought of that one yet!
@ph4um: At some point we need to ask whether .@SenatorReid is mentally capable of being Senate Leader.
@DorothyGrissom @ph4um @SenatorReid no, we already know he isn't. He's gone senile! Thinks this country is a dictatorship now lol #tyranny
@BilliTheGoat: I fear you're right. @ph4um .@SenatorReid
@SenatorReid Millions more are waiting for you to retire Harry.
@Calle_Elefante @SenatorReid  Call you on that, I can show you millions of name of those that want him right where he is, Democratic Party

@SenatorReid @j363j 
...oh, but isn't #Benghazi more important to the nation rather than caring for its citizens...
#RenewUI RT @Cajytarn: @SenatorReid @j363j  ...oh, but isn't #Benghazi more important to the nation rather than caring for its citizens...
@SenatorReid How about attaching #renewUI to the tax cuts bill? People are watching, Harry. What you do now will be remembered in November.
@worldwider1 Agreed. I do not predict I will forgive inaction on #RenewUI. Buck stops here and now. @rachelc13388066 @SenatorReid
@SenatorReid do you attach any job bill, to RenewUi ?
@SenatorReid
@SenatorReid 6 months since Senator Murray caved in to that piss-ant Paul Ryan?!?! (Austerity for the poor...massive deficits for the rich?)

@SenatorReid
@SenatorReid Maybe they should try working like the rest of us. They could also go back to the land of their citizenship.
@SenatorReid and @NancyPelosi r terrified that much smarter and honest @TGowdySC is getting in the ring. The Dems r  bracing for humiliation
@SenatorReid @SenateDems someone should go back in time and show ur mom and dad what a rubber is.
@SenatorReid @SenateDems and even pay terms. No one should make over 50k to run our country. And give them obamacare.
@SenatorReid @SenateDems lets just fire you all.
@SenatorReid @purplehullpea The House GOP heads are filled of Visions of #Benghazi and #IRS  to care about The American People
@garak99 @SenatorReid It's one fake outrage after another.

@SenatorReid Hey Harry, we've been demanding an investigation in2 Benghazi, Extortion 17, IRS scandal; when are we going 2 have some action?
@SenatorReid I  do not understand why people in this country have no compassion . extending UI affects you in no way unless u r unemployed

@SenatorReid @SenateDems
@SenatorReid  it's just coincidental that this issue is heating up with you and Nancy and other Dem leaders just as Benghazi is getting hot.
@SenatorReid Call me crazy Harry..but why are you and @BarackObama letting @SpeakerBoehner @GOPLeader destroy 3M ppl by not allowing a vote?
@SenatorReid Harry...the House is playing your game. How many bills are YOU sitting on...refuse to put on floor for vote..PAYBACK IS A BITCH
@SenatorReid 2/3 clean the house! Today should B that day! 133 Days  Insubordination, Disorderly, We ask for task force/committee for review
@SenatorReid  Why are the Democrats afraid for the truth about the death of 4 Americans at Benghazi to be exposed to the people?
@SenatorReid #Benghazi FOUR #AMERICANS DIED
@SenatorReid Maybe the 2.6 million job seekers should be out seeking jobs rather than waiting for your next handout? #socialist #Hypocrite
