that's funny, exactly what Obama and the Dems did...
and all that worked out great.
It would be hard to cut taxes of the 47% who pay $0.
hmmm but Obama did it with ACA and you were OK with it! Work with @POTUS ! We are sick of gridlock!
Sick of gridlock?! What did repubs do in congress last 6 years?
same as the Dems, zero!  I know, you thought I would praise them. Try again libby
#hypocrisy
Where were you when Obamacare was signed in the middle of the night with no @SenateGOP input? 1200 Pages, no doubt!
@Marina_Sirtis Is this one of the Senators who rushed through ObamaCare without reading it?
@SenateDems no this should be reviewed very closely and take in consideration all Americans.
Like the Obama care disaster ?
ACA CBO:
- H.R. 3762 would decrease deficits by about $474 billion over the 2016–2025 period

well there you go!!!
@TheDemocrats  business as usual for repubs. Rush it thru before anyone can see how bad it is. #Trumpcare
@kathyprojo pretty similar to how Obamacare was rolled out. Noone read the bill!
But it did go through the CBO.
@TheDemocrats democrats if you help to pass the bill to dump Obama care so the tax money goes to pay the taxes of the rich. dOA
@TheDemocrats there is no such Trumpcare where did you get this idea more BS from Senator's and Pelosi.
@TheDemocrats LOL, rush it through?  At least it is being read. Unlike @NancyPelosi saying pass it to find out what's in it
And #GOP and @realDonaldTrump have started saying the CBO score is fake. Bring truth back to governance, please.
not gonna happen! #Trumpcare
hmm. Pot meet kettle? Isn't this what they accused Democrats of during ACA?
@TheDemocrats what would Democrats know about rushing a healthcare bill through WITHOUT READING IT FIRST?
@TheDemocrats  govt don't care about poor
Absolutely. No CBO score, No Vote.  I might add, terrible bill as most know by now.
@SenateDems  they wrote it so now you can read it & discuss it & adapt it, only libs would think that as that is what u all did
@SenateDems Really it wasn't that hard
U All
@TheDemocrats U
@TheDemocrats Look who's talking. "Pass it so we can see what's in it". Dems - Party of misdirection
@TheDemocrats finally the answer as to why BigE trying so hard after 7 yrs of doing nothing they get a con man in office
<LYing Jack.  It's there for everyone to read.  Republicans do not work in secret as the DemoRats.  Participate or shut up.
@TheDemocrats WRONG AGAIN, LIBERALS!! Russia helped me write #AHCA. Assured me it was the best medicine for US health care!!
@TheDemocrats Another Republican comedy routine - see how crazy we can make everybody by doing shit upside down and backwards.
@TheDemocrats Once again, Dems accuse others of doing exactly what they did eight years ago. Everyone knows you lie for power!
@TheDemocrats why does everyone keep talking about CBO SCORE??!! Are they in the tournament?? Can't find it on WH cable!! BAD!!
Obama spent 6/7 months touring the country to promote the health bill. @realDonaldTrump zero explanation on this bill
@TheDemocrats  American's are sick of this crap with.. Get together and do your jobs for us American's.. Or we will vote u out
@TheDemocrats "TRYANCARE" is the fastest GOP has moved in 9 years.6 years 2 plan, zero planning. The rush is 2 pass it B4 truth
@TheDemocrats Dems did the SAME THING with Obummercare! #DemsAreHypocrites
We should believe the CBO report WHY? Remember OBamacare and CBO - why shld we expect this one to be right?
@TheDemocrats I don't believe any of it; I'm a "wait&see" person  ppl, MSM, parties have little credibility.
hell no!
@TheDemocrats #NoScoreNoVote
I bet the Dems would never do that, right? Oh wait..you did. Now we all suffer. This really diminishes you. @POTUS #Obamagate
The GOP bill is posted on the internet for anyone to read. Pelosi told us we had to pass your bill to see what's in it
I like the Ryan Plan. Puts ppl w/preexisting on state run high risk plans letting healthy ppl buy their own brand.
it matters #noscorenovote
Senator. Is this your idea of a *stirring message to the voters*? If so, I think I see why we're out of power everywhere.
Government shouldn’t be in the business of Healthcare period!!!
really makes you wish you'd done the correct thing and instituted single payer instead of capitulating to corporate donors huh?
you and the rest of the corporate democrats, including Gina "Goldman Sachs" Raimondo, are horrible people, just like the GOP.
@SenateDems so ah snowflake, how do it feel to be snuffed?
how about you oppose because it strips healthcare from millions, not because it hasn't met some wonky bureaucratic requirement
Honestly I don't care about the CBO score. The bill is bad on the face of it. Just reject a bad bill ok?
Would you dummies just counter with Medicare for all instead of these interminable appeals to procedural propriety?
Where was this attitude when ACA was first passed? Read the bill and passed under reconciliation!
don't call it Trumpcare, this is #GOPCARE. It needs to be hung on all their necks. Don't let His Orangeness be the scapegoat
@PoliticalShort Pist markup is already scheduled for CBO review, but I thought no one trusted CBO
Didn't the Republicans recently pass a measure making it illegal for the CBO to review & rate this?
@Marina_Sirtis And how was Obama care passed again. Oh yes rushed by dems and shoved through. The current plan doesn't work.
It forces all hard working citizens to cover medical for illegals. There needs to be a plan to help all.
instead of completely screwing the middle class with premiums that are unaffordable and coverage
that we do not need. The new plan is being demonized but if you actually looked at it
you would see it helps all. The author of the ACA admitted they counted on American stupidity.
@SenateDems they will do it anyhow like their doing everything else
@LilleyDennese cause it sucks
#why #aren't #you #spending #time #investigating and #prosecuting #Trumprussia #anyone #working with #russia should be #hung
if this piece of crap passes, repunklicans lose Congress and Whitehouse forever after we pass Medicare for all.
Don't call it #trumpcare -allows blaming one man. Use #Republicare & make the GOP own this disaster.
They also will defund Planned Parenthood , which is a health care provider. The government does not pay for abortions.
it's a bit tempting to let @GOP pass this mess with no dem support. Should @POTUS supporters face the music?
we are with you , please keep up the fight !
We are with @RepLloydDoggett too
Stay strong. Too many stand to lose so much!
the Obamacare Cbo score was accurate?  Funny!!!!
'We need to pass it to find out what's in it' Nancy Pelosi.
Like you hacks rammed obamacare through? #Vault7
Hearing this saves me a phone call to your office.  You're on the job! Thanks!
@SenateDems @jaketapper @ananavarro @marcorubio: I believe Price said they're going to get a CBO score during the press conf.
@SenateDems F us all
Give the @SenateDems a billion dollars and they can't even create a website. Ha!
aren't you the smart one? Sounds like something @SenWhitehouse would say.
you're kidding me right? Obamacare was in dark backroom w unions and senators no gop input lol good god you libs
Hello? ACA, No Republican votes. Must pass it to see what's in it - Pelosi #liberalhypocrisy
#SwampCare
@SenateDems R's know Dems will vote against it anyway, they R rushing it through so that Conservatives have no chance to read.
@SenateDems If Obamacare is so wonderful why don't you have it?????
They're not going to have the Republican plan either lol.
@Marina_Sirtis everyone listening, #call your reps. #House and #senate. Give them hell about this horrible rush job. #notok
the ACa was analyzed by the cbo.
It's out for review! We never saw #obamacare
@SenateDems love how you accuse the rep of something your party did.. always the same bs from libs..
according 2 p. ryan 10 min.ago(live feed), everything was done out in the open & honorably & ACA was done in secret
