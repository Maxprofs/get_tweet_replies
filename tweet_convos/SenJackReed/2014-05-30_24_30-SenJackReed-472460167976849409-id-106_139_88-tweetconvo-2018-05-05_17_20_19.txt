@SenJackReed Thank you.  Why don't you try a 12 month retro #RenewUI bill with a bipartisan #jobs bill attached.  Maybe that would work...
@buckeyemimi27 @beaachgirl5 @SenJackReed #RenewUI - And make sure it covers the 99ers who are still out of work.
@olimassociates Huh?
@beaachgirl5 @SenJackReed
@olimassociates @beaachgirl5 @SenJackReed < I would be happy with Tier 1.  Many have not received the benefit of even 1 extension.  #RenewUI
@buckeyemimi27 @beaachgirl5 @SenJackReed And many on #renewui have been fighting for that for you, while living without income for 5 months.
@olimassociates @beaachgirl5 @SenJackReed Yes..I've been here..but #RenewUI isn't about asking 4 more than 99wks. It can't last 4ever... :-/
@buckeyemimi27 @beaachgirl5 @SenJackReed They've created the problem for many middle class professionals now transitioning into poverty.
@olimassociates @beaachgirl5 @SenJackReed I agree..need to stop shipping jobs overseas but s'times you have to try to go where the flow is..
@SenJackReed Please draft a 12mo retro #RenewUI bill w/training & job creation measures included. Get a vote & get it done.  
@SenDeanHeller
.@SenJackReed Where is Senate support for you & @SenDeanHeller? #RenewUI

.@SenJackReed That'll pay the bills. How about getting .@BarackObama to actually put forth an effort? #RenewUI
@SenJackReed We appreciate your sentiments, but we are desperate for $ help after 5 months. 3mill #taxpayers ignored. #RenewUI @usrdxzdz

@SenJackReed @SenateDems  reinstate extended unemployment and increase budget for the VA
@SenJackReed @BJ28851036 Don't you think it's time to tell 3M families they've been abandoned by their gov't? No #RenewUI no #HelpVets
@SenJackReed @SenateDems I'm disappointed that so many are taking money from lobbyists as a form of #Legal-Bribery against #NetNeutrality
@SenJackReed WHY wasn't #RenewUI in the BUDGET?
@jlea317 @SenJackReed I think the story is. Warren forgot to put it in. Dems fault.
@SenJackReed if these people put the same effort into finding work than they do bitching about politicians then they'd have jobs.
@SenJackReed thank you Mr. Reed it needs to be done people are losing everything. Please help our fight to renew unemployment
@SenJackReed Disappointed that you couldn't do something simply, i.e. include JOB-creating measures in the bill. #SNAFU #failure #tcot
@SenJackReed need better push than this to help LTU! 3 million need help NOW!! #RenewUI
@SenJackReed Please continue to fight for us. Nothing has changed, we need your help. #RenewUI  #Hope4Jobs
@SenJackReed please tell us what you are going to do about this ? @SpeakerBoehner must have someone on his team willing to discuss this?
@SenJackReed you always address it right before a let down. And then silence.. So please share what's the plan? #renewui
@Daughterofnine @Thermz understand that @SenJackReed plan is to let long term unemployed lose everything & then blame Obama! #RenewUI
@LilBitsTheFirst @Thermz @SenJackReed starting to feel that way
TY! @SenJackReed: Disappointed @HouseGOP HasBlockedBipartisan #RenewUI fix. Help'g job seekers is still the right thg2do&soWeWILLkeepTRYING.
@SenJackReed & @SenDeanHeller are rare congressional members that are doing something with #RenewUI  so any anger towards them is misplaced.
@SenJackReed what else is left senator the speaker is firmly entrenched in his stance for fear of losing ctrl of caucus his caucus
@SenJackReed - Haha, that’s cute. It’s apparent both sides do not care.
@SenJackReed @SenateDems   After two years still seeking jobs - pass a lot of help wanted signs.Members of congress should start collecting
@SenJackReed Stop trying and DO something EUI has always passed even when unemployment numbers were lower This is CRIMINAL #RenewUI
