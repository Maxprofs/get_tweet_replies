@glee_fanDL @alittlejelee Yes, please.
A Boston Globe New Hampshire journalist, now columnist, and L'Engle obsessive (Madeleine was a mentor) would love to interview Jennifer about Wrinkle coming up March 9. Please contact Quincy Whitney, quincy@quincywhitney.com http://www.quincywhitney.com

@alittlejelee Friendlier villains perhaps, I think @JeremyClarkson is available? :)
@hijproductions @alittlejelee @JeremyClarkson Friendlier Villain? What would be the point? We need an ever badder villain. maybe with powers
@MicahHirsh @alittlejelee @JeremyClarkson Because friendlier villains are more successful & have pals that will bail them out all the time.
@hijproductions @alittlejelee @JeremyClarkson Maybe have a bad villain and a nice henchman comedic duo. Those are great.
@MicahHirsh @alittlejelee @JeremyClarkson I'm sure it will be another hit whichever direction they decide to go. :)
@hijproductions @alittlejelee @JeremyClarkson  they should just put Yzma and Kronk in it. It would be an instant success.
Please don’t give Elsa a Love Interest I look at her as a strong independent women who can rule her kingdom on her own. Make it about Why she was born with her powers or something !!!
i love you !!!! thank you soooo much for this movie...........
It's time for Elsa being a hero in FROZEN 2!!!!
YAY!!!!!!Frozen 2 at last !!! Really can't wait...I LOVE the first movie sooo imagine what will happen with the 2nd!!! 
@alittlejelee  Ooooh when will it be released? Sooo exciting!

@alittlejelee Congrats on your 1000★ tweet! http://favstar.fm/t/576078755015200769 …
@alittlejelee Please take the time to craft a good, emotional story. :-) Frozen was fantastic because it was a non-traditional fairy tale.
@alittlejelee ...with great characters and great music.
I think it will perpetuate a stereotype that strong women leaders are inherently lesbian.
I'm crying
@alittlejelee oh Frozen changed my life my direction
@alittlejelee maybe Nickelodeon will beat you Disney. I am sick of Frozen's Let It Go. Please produce it now. Please.
@alittlejelee Is it going to be released direct-to-DVD or theatrical?
@alittlejelee Oki
