So basically nothing has changed. Aca is a shit show of increasing premiums
Only because it's being white-anted by GOP. Make it better and it WILL work.
How specifically do you "make it better"? No one wants it.  either get subsidized, or you you forced to pay way too much w a high deductible
@salemstate
HEROS are FOREVER! Presidents come and go & most of them are forgotten! CONGRATULATION Senator John McCain! https://twitter.com/sarrata/status/888045693318942720 …
Unfortunately when used by Republican hacks "freedom" is code & a warning that they're trying to screw you.
Gotta love the Common Core math the left loves to use.
God almighty.  The gits have no soul.
@realDonaldTrump you call this a better bill?  Can you add and subtract? #TheResistance @jodomeow
CBO is rarely correct. Premiums and especially deductibles under Ocare already skyrocketed. It's still law of the land if you didn't hear.
I believe the number of folks that won't have health  ins is going to higher than predicted  - seniors - children - unemployed/employed
It's the freedom to pay more for less. Republican style freedom.
Downloaded. We are paying attn. Time to correct it. ;)
And yet the minimum wage increase is ignored because cause & effect...meh
But at least it won't have Obama in the name amirite
In case anyone thought it was a good idea to pass that bill last night
See what Trump followers want for their fellow Americans, these people have no God and no shame, especially that troll Pence
Fuuuuuuuuu
#Shame @PatTiberi @senrobportman you should both be very ashamed.  Fix the ACA 700k people in Ohio now have coverage.
The Freedom to pay more and get less... that's Trump #MAGA
At $7.30 an hour for work it would take everybody in the family to work just so I can afford Health Insurance !! .
Freedom Bill? Freedom from having access to health care?
@joeljanse this is worse
At least I wouldn't be forced to buy the garbage. Plus the CBO said the ACA would lower premiums and they have gone up well over 20%
Thank you Andy and @USCBO for working so hard to let us know what's going on.
Wow
Like I said FcK @MitchMcConell
Shouldn't that have been known as the "Freedom from Healthcare" bill?
So now time to join rest of world & opt for single payer healthcare?
#failOmatic45 for the un-win
freedom from tax for billionaires!
For those few who will be able to afford it. 36 million more will be without insurance
This is horrible. Why don't they like the people who PAYS them their salaries & buys them their health care???! We deserve good health care!
Maybe Trump supporters SHOULD lose their coverage. Might make them think twice before casting a vote for a moron. Would serve them right!
This just in, Trump now thinks CBO is fake news
Thank god I am a disabled veteran and I got VA benefits....Gonna be laughing at all those trump supporters
That is absolutely criminal!!
@GOP @SenatorBurr @ThomTillis vote no. I know you don't give a damn about actual humans, but we are who you are supposed to represent.
Lost ins. and cut to partime after ocare. Cry me a river
But do R's care?
That's a damned good cost reduction. Yes, I'm using liberal math. How's that compare to prior years?
GOP NEEDS TO BE BEAT DOWN IN 2018...this shit is ridiculous. Party over Country...even if people die.
What does the CBO think of global warming?
Thanks CBO for the red flag. Kill this bill.
that's a 515% increase on Americans' premiums by 2026, vastly more than what's "saved"
Because the CBO is always accurate??
2018: 120%
2019: 144%
2020: 173%
2021: 207%
2022: 249%
2023: 299% 
2024: 359%, 
2025: 430%
2026: 516%
2027: 619%
Murder is easy when  you don't know faces and names
To all who voted for a GOP Senator...this is your Senate...
Due to compounding, that translates to premium more than 6 folds higher in 10 years.
The CBO has no fans among those who are familiar w them. Their forecasts are right only 10% of the time.  #MAGA
So roughly $21.60 according to crooked donny drump
Its like old fashioned health care, where families can go bankrupt because of a car accident.
Now where's the freedom in that?
Freedom to take your money. @SenateGOP
It's hard to believe we are still living in #America anymore.
it truly is. I can't believe no one is brave enough to take a stance against this!
No it's the #mmmmma. Mitch McConnell Memorial Medical Murder Act
Where in the cbo pdf does it say "Premiums will be 20% higher in EVERY year 2018-2026"
Time for every American that cares for thei neighbor to vote GOP out! Need Universal Healthcare right= 30 countries save $ and lives!
Do you know if this is above the historical increase? I'm trying to figure this out, but hope someone else knows quicker...
What the fuck kind of "freedom" is this for people who are disabled and cannot afford the medications they need to survive?
Insurers just lost their government handout & their customers. Hell, if I can't get adequate coverage, I won't pay for inadequate coverage.
I can't find the info about premiums in that report. If it is saying annual increases of 20% for 9 years, that's a compounded 416%.
Which would mean that a premium of $500 a month today would increase to $2580 a month in 2026.
But I'm sure all those billionaires won't want us to be bankrupt or dead, so they would give generously to the middle income medical fund. 
Maybe everyone other than elderly and veterans should pay for their own insurance. I do. And my premiums are considerably more than in 2010
Mine is more as well but w/ACA more of my fellow Americans have coverage I am Ok with extra $ as a am a Christian.
Religion has nothing to do with expecting all citizens to work and pay their own way.
Small children born with terrible diseases cannot pay there own way at 3 or 5 years old .  Veterans with PTSD may (1)
Not be able to pay.  People who hit a hard patch after divorce or multiple deaths in their family might not be able (2)
Good job @GOP
Yes it's truly liberating to be enslaved financially to an oligarchy because that is a symbol of democracy, right?
They don't care.
The freedom to raise rates every year that's freedom. Knowing your stock will go up every yr w/o the CEO doing any thing, freedom.


@SenatorEnzi 20% increase every year! Less coverage, more expensive. Where's your compassion? @PattyMurray
Note to Bernie or Busters: this is what Bust looks like. 16M lose insurance next year

Stop calling if "Freedom Bill"!!!!!
"nailed it"
What exactly are you fixing in Obamacare?  2018!  @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan
And the 2nd Obamacare CBO score showed how it would raise the debt! You want O care, start cutting programs and agencies that overlap
Wait I thought premiums were the problem...
Freedom never felt so cruel.  #shameful
It's going up faster than that now, dicknose
BREAKING:  CBO scores are typically way off and hence forth considered garbage.
.@ASlavitt "Freedom" from taxes if one is wealthy.
End Medicaid and Medicare NOW.
That's impossible.
Why? It would align back with the Constitution.
Andy call it #TrumpCare,please
I will NEVER call it the Freedom Act
But everyone is going to be winning with JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! So details like this don't matter, right?
That's cool mine will go down. Because they went up 120% under #ACA
Freedom from healthcare
Please vote no @SenJohnMcCain!
#RegularOrder
Please vote no @SenBobCorker and @SenAlexander! 
20% increase in premiums?!
whatever
How did they get a CBO that fast?!?
20% increases to premiums compounded for the next 9 years will be devastating to the American people. Please do not vote for this bill.
What's with the "Freedom" moniker? Free to DIE because we can't afford it anymore? I guess so.
@SenatorEnzi @LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain @SenMikeLee @SenCapito Do the Math!
@Deemoney521 Oh he'll no. We're calling this the GOP FREEDOM BILL. Not Senate Freedom Bill. They own this piece of garbage. Y

Freedom for whom??????
