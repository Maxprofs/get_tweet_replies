Thank you, Senator. Now please work with @SenSanders, @SenWarren to get Goldman Sachs out of community colleges. #Enough
@SenWarren Thank you for having her back. Stand strong for New England values. #letLizspeak
She believes Sessions a danger to black America she must be heard. She worked along side Sessions must know
Warren slanders while she took homes from the poor & resold at profit then lied about ethnicity 4 professional gain
@mitchellreports shut her down
thank you
@SenateDems You voted wrong!
If u believe senators should b allowed 2impugn their colleagues, then vote 2have rule changed instead of signaling to ur base.
read the King letter on the floor!
@SenateDems turning into the party of No, Hastags, and no ideas. Where the Dems I remember that actually stood for ideals?
More Dems showing true inferior character & inability to proceed with the business of our country-disgraceful!
Thank you Senator Reed. #letlizspeak #RESISTANCE
@SenateDems need to wake up that WE THE PEOPLE are sick of your bullshit. We demand you work with @POTUS @realDonaldTrump #MAGA
how often did the GOP do that under Obama?
What does THAT have to do with anything?? We need to move forward. #MAGA
If you can't see it you obviously are part of the problem.
No actually I'm just repeating the same SHIT we had to hear from @SenJackReed @SenateDems for 8 yrs. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
Proud of you, Senator!
@SenateDems U put yourself in her category. WOW!
Thank you!
Thank you!
This is quickly reaching insanity! They vote without both parties present. They put gags on Dems. The truth is barred, illegal!
she is a disgrace to the senate and this nation
Geez Jack, really?  Haven't you and all of us heard enough for a lifetime?
thank you
thank you!
thank you
Thank you. I hope your opposition extends beyond voting once and you will continue to speak out against this harmful agenda.
shut her up!! She is an obstructionist running her own agenda.hahaha she thinks she has a chance at president..LOL
shut her up!!

Thank you for continuing the fight for freedom of speech in the Senate -- never thought I'd see days like these.
@mitchellreports That's too bad.
read the letter!
Thanks Jack! Always appreciate you voting your conscience - Dylan Teague 02893
you'll be voted out like most of your cohorts lol
@SenateDems  Let her speak, if not everyone read the letter!
here's a thought how about following the rules or do they not apply to her
thank you!
Fake news is like the Fake Indian! She's a blabber mouth elitist!
thank you for voting to #letlizspeak
@PaulBegala Thank senator. Keep up the resistance!
but that wouldn't be fair to all the dogs who feel like their heads will explode when Liz speaks
@mitchellreports Proud of your courage and support.
I was appalled when she was silenced on the floor.
Democracy is under attack so thank you Sir, for fighting for what is right
@mitchellreports bravo
Thank you, Senator.
@SenateDems anyone that believes #fauxahontas @SenWarren is honest has to have their head examined. @GOP @HouseGOP @Reince
Thank you Senator!
Thank you for trying to #letlizspeak

your Tweet was quoted in a story by @mashable
@mitchellreports 
Thank you for standing up for what's right!
Letlizspeak!
how is this helping anything? People are getting frustrated
Get to fucking work instead of playing political games.
She is a shining example of what ordinary Americans are sick of. You should stay away from her
@mitchellreports Thank you!!
and then all of u and the media would pounce on the Repubs for breaking decorum and shameless attack on fellow colleague.
do you think you are exempt from rules too? Your pal Harry would've done the same thing to Repubs had roles been reversed
it is Repubes
@mitchellreports All these geldings scared of a women with balls. Pathetic. Let free speech ring out!
@mitchellreports-her re-election is in jeopardy.46% want her out.Only 44% want her to stay! Keep digging your grave Lizzard!!!
@PaulBegala  I VOTE TO #LetLizSpeak #WeThePeople STAND BY LIZ!! WE OPPOSE JEFF SESSIONS"! THIS IS NOT NAZI !! SHAME ON GOP!!
@mitchellreports well good for you! How courageous! On the other hand, I would have walked over and punched out McConnell. 
That's great. Now, ask Liz why she voted for Ben Carson. Why is she supporting this circus cabinet?

@mitchellreports u mean lying pocahontas....who makes 400 grand teaching but is gonna lower college costs LMAO
will she admit finally that she's not actually Native American?
Thank you!
Thanks for standing with our senator!
What the Hell Happened to StrongerTogether, cant keep Up.MorePosters to make.Really?Whydidn'tUjerks visit Wisconsin
Thank you! @SenJackReed #LetLizSpeak
glad that worked eh? You schmendrick
@SenateDems That is how it should be. It is not like she was personally attacking him. E.W. read a historic primary source.
she insulted sessions multiple timed  was warned, she did it again then finally stopped. It's out there
OK thanks I'll check it out. I will review full transcript or try to find it. 
she had the chance when it could have mattered: Supporting @SenSanders
@SenateDems Thank you! For standing up for what's right.
I don't know, I mean we all know what her voice sounds like...It is not pleasant.
keep up your antics little jackie. the country knows you are a traitor and coward. CRY LITTLE JACKIE CRY
socialism lost.  Deal with it
@SenateDems thank you. Now let's get together and win some more seats for you. #whatCanIDo
spare us all and keep her mute.  No one should be subjected to her idiocy.
Thank you, Jack! Wish I was still represented by you!
please spare everyone she's a crackpot.
Thank you. #LetLizSpeak
@SenateDems stay the course and follow @SenWarren's lead!  #ReadTheLetter #GoodTrouble
@SenateDems I support you!
senate democrats appealing to their base by virtue signaling. Elections for them are this year. GL with that.
please tell all your Democrat pals to read the letter on the floor.  Can't 19 everyone!
We True Americans have heard ENOUGH of big mouth Liz SPEAK. You libs are dividing our country. TRUMP WAS VOTED IN. DEAL WITH IT
...and ya lost
We did not lose ....YOU won! Now go do your job n hold your president"s feet to the fire if yu love our country! SMH
I won? You take this too personal.
Every male democrat should read Coretta Scott King's letter. Or at least try to.
they can't read!
from a fellow Rhode Islander - thanks for the vote, but go up there and read the letter!
@SenateDems now read the King letter on the floor. Make them shut you all down!
@whitehouserogue someone NEEDS to read 'The Sneetches!' All 4 stories over & over!
thank you

good. You can stay.
we saw. we are watching
"In society under which the stronger faction can ... oppress the weaker, anarchy may...be said to reign" - James Madison
Thank you for the hard work you're doing. Vote no on every single remaining nominee. @SenateGOP needs to hear us.
@SenateDems You mean screech?!
.@SenJackReed not enough to vote #LetLizSpeak. Take to the Senate floor and read the letter from CSK. Every Dem Senator should be doing it.
@SenateDems She is a NATIVE American....!!!!!  Let her speak because she is a minority.  
Who lines your pockets? Put America's best interests above your commitment to your puppetmasters.  We love @jeffsessions !
@jeffsessionsAfraid to read into record an historical primary source. That is sad.  Made MTN out of a molehill.
What is wrong with you?  Oh wait, you're a Dem.
Thank you Senator Reed!
Get up there and read the letter, too! #ReadTheLetter
Read her letter!
