#Our49 #MiguelAngelHonorato #ForeverMyCity #ForeverOurCity #OnePulse #CityBeautiful #OrlandoUnitedDay #OrlandoUnited #OrlandoStrong
I recalled a year ago and the ONLY ONE who responded with love and it wasn't any of the Democrats.  Prayers for the family & survivors.
Until Islam is removed from the US, I'm afraid we'll have more of this. 
Look at you trying to get attention
How is he trying to get attention by stating the obvious that these poor people were killed by a murderous Muslim thug?
Look at you trying to steal his attention
Look at your weak af reply
Can we remember Omar Mateen? He is as much a victim of hate as the people whose lives he took. He needs our prayers too.
If I was a fat terrorist sympathizer with that ugly of a wife id probably just off myself tbh.
Don't forget too that it was a RADICAL MUSLIM that killed the 49, NOT a Christian. Don't be stupid, call it out for what it was.
A Christian priest rape many deaf boys in Wisconsin and is now a fugitive from justice in Vatican City. Religion poisons everything
It's impossible to have life without religion, actually. Unless you want to play semantics. Which harmful religion are you talking about?
With love..
i yeah real love Nana
Absolutely.. Love is love always..
i like that for a beautiful lady like you
In our haerts always  
Please please please Retweet my trans poetry video fb Victoria Chanel Santos IG _victoriachanel_ #thishastostop!
@WFLAMelanie In
interviews with Pulse club patrons,
on Univision,it was clear Mateen 
frequented & partook of happenings.


On order for us to have peace. There must be war... Islam is hate.. There is nothing good about it...
if every muslim in the world hated gays and other lgbtq+, then that'd mean well over 2 bil people despise them, which is an erroneous number
Go educate yourself.. Take a trip to these Muslim country's and find out for yourself.. Take that trip too chop chop square and see yourself
DEMAND DEMOCRACY AMERICA #VOTE Republicans out of Local State and Federal Government END THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
What do Republicans have to do with an anti-gay Islamic extremist?
You can thank Obama and the Democrats for allowing these terrorists into our Country!!!
John 1:12
But as many as received Him, to them He gave the #right to become #children of #God, to those who [1/2]
That's nonsense. God doesn't exist
If you keep voting in Democrats, you will always remember many many more Orlandos ... Sen. Schumer cried when Pres. tried to vet refugees.
#onepulse
What is the darkness, pray tell, Islam?
@WFLAMelanie It's
truly Shameful that the local Tampa
TV news stations,who trip over 
themselves,can provide legitimate
news.
What about ALL the human lives lost in every other shooting?

#Orlando
Amen on that.  A sad day
My thoughts are with the victims and the survivors of this horrific tragedy 1 year ago. #LoveConquersHate

#PulseNightclub Caused by an Islamic terrorist. The left has abandoned the LGBT and aligned itself with radical islam. Never forget that!
Amen
And all the survivors, family, friends and first responders 
You are so right! Do you have to be right about everything? - Christopher Graham
What  irony you support the Islamofascist that demand gays be murdered! Tell the truth. You do not care about the gay community!
Bull. Your to busy playing games in your office to care about the people massacred in Orlando!
How can light defeat darkness it can't see and how can love defeat the hatred it has not met
Thank you from Orlando metro for ur words. Amazing 45 is silent 15 hours into the anniversary! SMH
Also ron and nicole..yup..the oj thing...same date ..cruelty is where you find it...lite many candles tonight. March on!
Never met you but you were family.  Miss you
So sorry for the victims and the friends and families that mourn for them. I pray friends and family find peace in their fondest memories.
Hoy y Siempre serán recordados
Also never forget that this was a terrorist attack by an individual that pledged allegiance to ISIS. Orlando & America hurts! Praying!
Funny they are blocking the ban and extreme vetting ,Minnesota mosque wants to ship gays to Iran to be killed
 sending thoughts & prayers 4 all
Will never forget this day. Lost someone so dear to me. May he Rest In Peace 
HAS POTUS OR HIS FAMILY OR WH REMEMBERED? TOO SHALLOW TO SHOW RESPECT!

How pathetic to try and gain from a tragedy

Schumer i see you forgot to mention who killer The 49.  Here I'll remind you it was a " radical islamic terrorist " !
Peace - Hope - and Love
#OrlandoUnitedDay #RememberThe49
Remember them for what? A gay night club with minors drinking with Adults at all hours of the night?
Ummmm.... You do realize that the travel ban is to stop, in part, Islamic terrorism of the gay community? Weird position you have guys.
Banning people who advocate throwing gays off rooftops might help.
So sad that all of these people are gone - we will not forget them!
No you don't remember @SenSchumer. Not while you want to bring more of them here. Faker.
Crying Chuck is crooked like his nose. Soros is your puppet master.
I pray for the victims and their families. However, no amount of hastags will solve this.
HOPE PEACE AND LOVE
BEAUTIFUL!  and thank you for sharing art to ease the pain
Thanks.  God bless us all! HOPE PEACE AND LOVE
How about remembering 911 Schumer and get to work protecting the USA
Vote your criminals home #wethepeople vote your clowns to a dead party
And Schumer is one of the Dems wanting to bring over more unvetted Muslims who WILL KILL as many LGBT's as possible
LOL Glad I'm in Maryland!!!

We sure will. With heavy hearts we'll remember. And with unyielding pride in a city and people that showed us all that's good about USA.
