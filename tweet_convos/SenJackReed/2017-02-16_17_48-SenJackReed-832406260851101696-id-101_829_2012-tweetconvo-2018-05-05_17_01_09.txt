Thank you Senator!
Obama's EPA destroyed the Colorado River! Dems actually hate the environment! Look at women's march too!
The fake scientists paid by liberals to lie.  The real scientists say, "we have no global warming".  Get over it!

Weather you think climate change is real or not, all should treat the plant with respect, keep it beautiful for life to thrive.
Who doesn't want to treat it right?
Just saying we all should take care of our plant weather you're a believer of climate change or not.
