My plan was to drive to Boston this week @mdhiggs. Awful weather all the way - all week long! I'm flying today instead.  @NWSBoston
Approx. 7 hours @mdhiggs. I don't mind the drive. I entertain myself quite well. :)
@mdhiggs Yup. I usually leave about 5am and can make there or home by mid-late afternoon. Depends on my 'retail therapy' stops in Maine.
Moving to CA: epic win.
