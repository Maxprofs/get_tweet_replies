.@SenJackReed @SenWhitehouse It is not too late to save yourselves from the ignominy that will attach if you cast a vote pro-#IranDeal.
@BeladonnaRogers @DrMartyFox @SenJackReed @SenWhitehouse Those two never think for themselves and don't have to. They tow the party line.
@SenJackReed @SenWhitehouse I just read the statement. Pretty weak, hope and change. Oh well, thanks for your consideration.
@SenJackReed @WhiteHouse @SenWhitehouse Hey Jack. explain how Iran inspecting itself is good for America.
@SenJackReed @SenWhitehouse These cowards support helping Iran Kill our Service Men.   They have to go.
@SenJackReed @SenWhitehouse Why are you guys anti Jew for Obama?
@SenJackReed @SenWhitehouse So u decided giving Iran $150 Billion to fund their activities to kill American Military Men & Women is good?
@SenJackReed @SenWhitehouse They have killed over 1000 of our military Men & Women & u will help them kill more????
@SenJackReed Result of Neville Chamberlain's deal w/Nazis caused WWII Obama's IranDeal will lead 2 war in Middle East & likely nuclear WWIII

Thank you very much!!

@SenJackReed @WhiteHouse @SenWhitehouse
@SenJackReed @WhiteHouse @SenWhitehouse I find it disturbing that you come to this conclusion. I guess the media is full of bad info
@SenJackReed @SenWhitehouse Thank U for giving diplomacy a chance.
@SenJackReed @WhiteHouse @SenWhitehouse Baaa!!
@SenJackReed @SenWhitehouse Thank you both for adding your voices to support nonproliferation and peaceful diplomacy.  #IranDeal
@SenJackReed @SenWhitehouse The @usma should revoke your diploma. Duty, Honor, Country, Bullshit
@SenJackReed @WhiteHouse @SenWhitehouse Beware what you wish for. Our children/grandchildren will bare the burden of war if you are wrong.
@SenJackReed @SenWhitehouse They are already buying missles with the 150 Billon to shoot down our jets.
@SenJackReed @SenWhitehouse Blood will be on your hands for every American killed by this terrorist nation.
@SenJackReed @SenWhitehouse What the heck is the matter with our politicians that they can even consider submitting to terrorists?
@SenJackReed @WhiteHouse @SenWhitehouse You are cowards to make such a deal with terrorists and murderers who won't live up to it
@SenJackReed @SenWhitehouse thank you choosing peace over war #IranDeal
@SenJackReed @WhiteHouse @SenWhitehouse Traitors! Both of you will be known for your support of terrorism! It is your legacy!
@angelathomas22 @SenJackReed @WhiteHouse @SenWhitehouse thank you Senators!! #forward #nonukes #diplomacy
@SenJackReed @WhiteHouse @SenWhitehouse I wonder sometimes if this agreement is way too complicated for the average person to understand.
@SenJackReed @WhiteHouse @SenWhitehouse I know there are classified issues and facts that the public won't know. War is always last resort.
@SenJackReed @WhiteHouse @SenWhitehouse thank you
@SenJackReed @WhiteHouse @SenWhitehouse trust Iran! Is like trusting a child molester in a daycare.
