@KlisKlasst @SenJackReed wtf are you talking about u look like an idiot
@SenJackReed You would have to wonder why House democrats didn't attach an amendment to the doc fix that re-instated EUI.
@SenJackReed @cerista Yes, we know the timeline. Foreclosures have a timeline too. #renewUI #HelpVets #OutInTheCold #EmergencyMeasures
@galeharrier @SenJackReed Some ppl missed it so I retweeted. I think foreclosures should be halted pending #RenewUI Evictions too.
@SenJackReed @SenateDems Someone needs to get work on house republicans, there not going to let this pass, HEARTLESS REPUBLICANS!!!
@SenJackReed Thank you for continuing to fight with us to #RenewUI  This chart helps make sense out of a somewhat confusing process. Bless u
@SenJackReed 4/3 vote? House won't pass B4 April recess. EUC delays cost me my lease. Homeless May 1st if no EUC $ IN ACCT by then #RENEWUI
@SenJackReed speaker B, will send it back empty!!! Stupid drunk republican!
It's not a matter of if, but when #RenewUI will pass the Senate. Here’s a primer on the process:  via @SenJackReed
This is the procedural road to #RenewUI in the Senate RT @SenJackReed: ”
@SenJackReed #RenewUI #ExtendUI read the very last line. *The house rules. States can pass without a vote if @SpeakerBoehner works w dems
@SenJackReed keep hope, shouldn't have to, were american citizens!!! Did the people of Ukraine! No, but they got there money!! F U!!
@SenJackReed Thank you for your support to #RenewUI For us facing eviction or foreclosure, and repossessions, the 'when' is today.
@SenJackReed I take it your office has been overwhelmed with calls of this important matter! Nice Tweet and a help to many! 

#RenewUI
@Lomawny @SenJackReed Why not us? Everyday, all day until it is done. This is your country. What will you do without it?
@SenJackReed if or when? we cant eat now. some will be living in boxes if its not passed by both houses by last week.
“@SenJackReed: It's not a matter of if, but when #RenewUI will pass Sen. Here’s a primer on process. - Keep everyone on the govt welfare tit
@SenJackReed this should really be something the president can executive order and bypass all of this. Our Gov't process is too slow
@SenJackReed you democrats have stalled on this for two weeks while taking vacations!!!! YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES!!!
@SenJackReed You're yet to work through a weekend to accomplish this much needed purpose. Ukraine, Malaysian flt, OB care all get attention.
@SenJackReed  Please do anything and everything to help us. The unemployed are not lazy.  We have children to feed and shelter. begging you
@senjackreed I understand the EUC bill is being added to the fireman's bill. What is the logic of this??? Can Boehner deny bringing it?
@SenJackReed @renewui does this mean senate working this weekend?
@SenJackReed Thank you for the info. Most of us are just starting to learn the process. Hoping for #RenewUI to House soon.
@SenJackReed @AlisonDoyle thanks for keeping us updated the 2 million+ looking to #RenewUI
@SenJackReed Repubs will find out in next election you can't play games with people's lives for 3 mos. I'll never vote repub again in life.
@SenJackReed @TuxcedoCat  It's a first step and well deserved. But what about the "Tan Man" and his inability to get a bill passed? #screwed

@SenJackReed thank you this helps give us some kind of actual timeline to look at
@SenJackReed where's the jobs Bills? Signed,
16 Million w/o jobs...
@SenJackReed well I truly hope so cuz we have heard one more day, be patient, this week, next week. Your recess petrifies millions #RenewUI
@SenJackReed Why? What you all are doing to over 2 million Americans & counting is heartless. More useless info. Just get off your asses.
@SenJackReed it just seems to me that there is an inherent problem with a government that hinges on one person-not even the POTUS #RenewUI
@SenJackReed @SenateDems Difficult to be hopeful in face of Boehner's obstinate unwillingness to lift a finger. #RenewUI
“@SenJackReed: It's not a matter of if, but #RenewUI will pass ” @NY_Patricia @missmagoo2513 @lalola28 @daisytalbot
@Iambjp @SenJackReed @NY_Patricia @missmagoo2513 @lalola28 we need 50 votes then 60 right
@SenJackReed Thank you very much for everything! You're a great leader! #RenewUI
@SenJackReed Although I support #RenewUI to me it does not look like it will happen. Need to start focus on making changes in DC.
@SenJackReed Thank you
@SenJackReed  There IS NO HOPE as long as Boehner is there.  Maybe we should riot and loot!!!
@SenJackReed My story was on MSNBC, I really don't want to live in my car, but I have NO CHOICE since Boehner said "It's too late"now april?
@SenJackReed You know Boehner will  shoot it down AGAIN.  I don't understand how 1 man has that much power even with the needed votes!!
@SenJackReed @SenateDems thank you, for me and the rest of the people cut off from extended benefits.  Thank you.
@SenJackReed @SenateDems how about a few jobs in between unemployment thanks
@SenJackReed @Lomawny @NY_Patricia @daisytalbot @missmagoo2513 @algreyson82 @bobpat361 @ScottWelk here's the process forward #RenewUI
