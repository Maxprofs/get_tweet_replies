@SenatorReid when will there be another vote to #ExtendUI? We are struggling to eat, to stay warm, to survive.
@twenty8divine @SenatorReid no time this week. It's vacation time for congress. Not kidding either
@NoWayHosea1 @SenatorReid does congress vacation every other week? GOP works 50% of the year & call the longterm UI lazy. IRONIC! #RenewUI
@twenty8divine @NoWayHosea1 @SenatorReid In fairness to Congress, those aren't vacations. They split time w/ their state offices. #RenewUI
@cerista @twenty8divine @NoWayHosea1 @SenatorReid Sorry but time away from Washington with no #renewUI vote is a frivolous vacation to me.
@Rsilver212 @twenty8divine @NoWayHosea1 @SenatorReid I agree they shouldn't leave without #RenewUI. I'm sure their constituents are pissed.
@SenatorReid #RenewUI good way to pay for UI. Take it away from congress salaries. Doing without might just make them realize.
@SunJanitorial @oobavpolitics @SenatorReid or maybe fire them all! These people forget who they're working for! #RenewUI
@SenatorReid Please help #RenewUI asap. Many families are in great need this winter. P.S. Yay for snow!
@SenatorReid How many times will you vote? No is no. This is an emergency program for unemployed. Find them jobs instead.
@SenatorReid This is, after all is said, a struggle for majority rule.
Republicans are all in on "it's my way, or I'll break it."
@MystcJim @SenatorReid @repsandylevin @GOP agreed! When? I'm a family suffering with three children. Something needs to be done now!

@opusx324 Is this fact or conjecture?
@galeharrier this is fact
@SenatorReid @WhiteHouse why should any Republican support anything you ask for? You have unilaterally decided to make them irelevant
@SenatorReid Don't they understand how devastating this is? We paid into the system for this,It'starting to look like a dog chasing its tail
@SenatorReid @WhiteHouse@FCC@SENATEFLOOR@HOUSEFLOOR@TREASURY IM NOT CERTAIN WHAT YOUR DEBATEING.

@senatorreid Reublicans demanded a delay for part of the ACA then accused The President of selective enforcement. What's the point?
@senatorreid We want Americans to know how a Democratic House and Senate will benefit the middle class, immigrants, women and jobs.
@senatorreid If they want to continue alienating voters let them. Who cares? We don't! Stop advising the GOP! It's time to change the focus.

@SenatorReid WHEN? The #unemployed need hope.
Bitter weather is causing more suffering to ppl thrown off UI

@SenatorReid Tell @SenatorKirk he can right his wrong of turning his back on those that got him elected. #RenewUI
@SenatorReid @MythicalStig AND AGAIN.
@SenatorReid @WhiteHouse  I hope Sen Reid will think long and hard how his recalcitrance and partisanship caused him to lose the Senate.
@SenatorReid @WhiteHouse We need Democrats and Republicans to figure out how to pay for benefits, check everything-even Addendums
@SenatorReid  Just keep bringing it up for a vote. I'm pretty sure there are plenty of unemployed people in red states who are PO'd.
@SenatorReid @WhiteHouse 3 friend on UI, until it ran out. All three college grads were employed within a month after the last check arrived
@SenatorReid @WhiteHouse If you're not going to be more brazen to call them out in a seriously blunt manner, then what's the point?
@SenatorReid thank you sir
@SenatorReid your position is unsustainable! how about passing incentives for ppl to find a job rather than taking my tax dollars 2 not work
.@SenatorReid and you think spending tax $ and incurring more debt is sustainable? #Idiot The best solution to unemployment is a job.
@SenatorReid @WhiteHouse no they should not because you and Obummer are nothing but Liars ! Come on midterms because miss Mary is fired !
@SenatorReid @WhiteHouse Don't think they are gonna think any longer or harder than you did.
@SenatorReid @WhiteHouse WHEN?
“@SenatorReid: I hope my colleagues across the aisle will think long and hard  about their unsustainable position on UI. CREATE JOBS NOW
