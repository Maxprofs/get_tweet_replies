Thank you, we need more people in the government to say something.
Now would be a good time for the Legislative Branch to take real action to remove that man. If THIS isn't the line, I weep for my country.
Enough. Impeach or invoke the 25th.
Congress needs to act now to protect this country
Senator, he has to defend them.  We call them racists, he calls them his base.  See the problem?
I haven't seen the President call "them" his base.
Just look at what they are saying in relation to what he is saying.  Don't be intellectually dishonest.
I haven't seen the President call "them" his base. That's a re-tweet.
Please point to when ANY President has ever point to a group or sub-group and said "They are my base."  You are intellectually dishonest.
Whare is your outrage over ANTIFA and BLM violence @SenJackReed ? #outragewhenitsuitsyou
Too late. He has shown the world who and what he is. He's not going to change, so don't wait for that to happen.  Deal with what he is.
AltLeft leaders pushing a lie. Senator please stop dividing the country as this is the poison that is killing our country.
Senator Reed, I differ on your statement! Two wrongs don't make a right! To much hatred!
When is enough enough?? When is he going to be removed from office???
About 7 1/2 years
Regardless of what DT thinks, Twitter isnt a platform for actual political declarations. You need to denounce him on the senate floor.
Thank you! #impeach #25thAmendment
TY for your moral clarity! @SenJackReed #StrongerTogether #LoveTrumpsHate #HeatherHeyer  
Senator Reed, for the good of the country, could you also condemn Antifa and BLM for their violent actions?
Our RI hypocrites! Lifelong pols.
Can you provide the quote where he actually defended them?
Actually he didn't. Read NYT today. The alt left were paid to fight that day.
in case you haven't been watching his conferences,,,, he didn't defend them, or the actions of the counter protesters.
@SenateDems Why are Democrats so scared to condemn the violence from this weekend, acknowledge the bigger problem and fix it.
You are deaf he condemned many including white supremist, stop obstructing and be a leader you say you are and work together! words matter
You defend antifa and BLM who conduct violence against others merely for having an opposing thought. Hypocrite. @RealJamesWoods
Why aren't you screaming when black lives matter burn flags and kill police?
#Really? What about da #whites aka #violentprotesters in da other side?
How about both sides of the aisle stop defending any violence that occurred in Charlottesville.... Violence is violence regardless of
If someone dies......
Impeach him, force his resignation, we are a country without leadership
@DanYorkeShow Senator, for the good of #RI and the country please resign.
He needs to be removed from office. Please impeach @realDonaldTrump
You people are idiots. All ready to jump on some damn band wagon. Trump responded at the proper time unlike Mr O who never responded
Did you NOT hear him today???
Funny how some things are ignored.
Calling out Antifa is not defending another group.
Senator. Enough is enough with Trump! He is a madman with the the Nuclear button in his hand!
For the good of the country, resign.
You lost me at "Mr. President"
Do you not believe they had a right to be there?  They had court ordered permit.  We're not condoning them, we're calling out the fascists.
With all due respect, @SenJackReed , for the good of the country, this unfit, disgraceful con artist needs to be impeached - immediately!
White supremicists not the problem or blame! You liberals are ruining this country! I will request Mitch to give me Senate voting pwr of 10!
Not a strong enough statement. Trump must go.
This man is not representing my America. He is not true American President
Trump doesn't care about this country. He is actively working to divide it with his Russian Masters.
It's not about the kkk or antifa it's that the president cannot denounce fundamentally unAmerican behavior whether it's Russia Putin or VA
Thank you 
He is a filthy excuse for a human being. Is it at all possible that we can get him out of the White House?
He has too......he cannot condemn the people who helped vote him into power....Trump will never isolate the far right they're his supporters
For the good of the country #ImpeachNow
#ImpeachTrumpNow 
Start hearings NOW
Start #ImpeachTrumpAndPence now!!!
You need to be much stronger in your rebuke of this man & what he stands for. I plead you condemn him & his statements. I beg of you.
He's like "I strongly condemn Hitler actions, but..."
Not good enough any more @SenJackReed! You must condemn this repulsive man, not just ask for an apology. @Impeach_D_Trump
For he good of the country? If you cared you would back up our @POTUS !
Senator Reed, for the good of the country, stop defending the vigilante terrorism of fascist #ANTIFA and cop-killing #BlackLivesMatter!
No! For the good of  Mr. President RESIGN now!
What makes you a good senator .Is your seat more important than standing up for what is right for the country
Your a senator use your voice for good. A tweet is admirable but use your voice to help get this man out of office what's right is what
What actions are those?
STRONGER WORDS!! #Trump is a domestic threat. DO SOMETHING.
How does he look his daughter in the eyes as a proud Jewish convert?
#ImpeachTrump
For the good of the country he should just quit.
TRAMP IS A RACIEST WHAT PART DONT YOU GET ! IMPEACH HIM ALREADY !
karma
Get behind we American people and get this guy out of office. Only the congress,can do that.
Senator, TY 4 stating Amer. values. This discord will not end 'til every MofC makes clear no President can unravel our nation with prejudice
:I have always wished America Trump for wishing Nigeria Buhari,even though I know Trump is far better than Buhari.
It's too late for that, Senator. He needs to be removed from office -- he's demonstrated time & again that he is dangerously unfit. #IMPEACH
It's too late!!! He's shown us who he is, we MUST believe him!!! #ImpeachTrumpAndPence
Get the facts first and you'll see why they do #senators @SenateGOP @HouseGOP learn the #Truth  of #Charlottesville @NCONTOMPASIS @POTUS
He has no idea what is good for this country or haven't you noticed that yet.
Sorry, Senator, but after THAT press conference, your words are not even remotely strong enough.
@GOP in action...those in support of removing the offensive monuments "should be LYNCHED!" -#Republican Rep. #KarlOliver of #Mississippi
Do something with this guy!
This is the best condemnation you can muster? Shame on you. This is completely inadequate.
He condemned both sides! Try the truth and condemn the bad on the left! Many of us were there and saw the bad of both
Not going to happen. Has to keep his base happy.
Donald Trump is a turd in the gold toilet that is the American Presidency.
It's too late for him to stop. He's shown who he is. The only thing he can do now is resign. That's it.
he should resign.
For the good of the country...resign!! #Trumpnazi
@SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenWarren  your voices are unbearably quiet.  The time to DENOUNCE this "President" is NOW, don't miss this moment
He's a lost cause. Even if he did say the right thing, he will do the wrong thing for our country every time. Get him OUT!
Senator Reed for the good of the country and the future of humanity, start the impeachment process #25amendmentnow
He can't. He is one.
Trump isn't making a series of dozens of mistakes here, Senator.  He is doing exactly what he intends with the messages he intends.
That's morally reprehensible and so are his supporters. They are acting as if they want to destroy this country
That is exactly what they want to do. They see the country as being "broken" and are actively trying to remake it in their image.
Are you delusional? Have you not been following this dangerous man?! #GOPownsMess
Never heard him defend them... Another lying DemocRats who knows he's lying but needs to incite his voters.
For good of country, impeach the racist.
Please please be the voice we cannot be!! Someone has to stop him.
Please, please, we have to get rid of this perpetrator of hate and evil pretending to be a president!  Help us!
The radical left is no better than the radical right.We need to come together as a nation.Trump is President and we all need to accept that.
And the actions of the left are not mentioned. Crap stirrer.
......and get the white supremacists out of the White House!! #FireBannon #FireMiller #FireGorka
For the good of our country RESIGN!!!!!!!
Jack is the Real White Supremacist!!! We need to look at his Investments and we know he votes with his lovely leaders like Maxine Waters!
This is welcome, but you'll have to be much, much stronger than this, Senator. You all will.
Yep. So much stronger!! #ImpeachTrumpNow #removehimfromoffice
Remove him, force him to resign, or this will not stop. Ever
Senator, the president's remarks deserve the censure of the Senate. #censuretrump
Impeach him.
Again using political cover in RI to make such a false statement!
Yes. That's right. As if RI politicians are one of the best politicians in the country.
That ship has sailed, Senator. When someone shows you who they are, believe them. Donald Trump is a racist.
You're so #brainwashed by #LiberalLogic  learn the. #Truth  first
Noticed only 1 pro alt-right reaction here... seems like most people support you!
Next he'll unleash them.
For the good of the country, he should resign.
Our damn country is in CRISIS! What are you doing? As a nation, we will not SURVIVE this @POTUS! Your silence, inaction is UNACCEPTABLE!
He is condemning actions on both sides.
Senator, this so-called President doesn't care a bit for the Good of the country. Only the good of his pockets.
He needs to resign or be impeached, period. Start working on it, Senator.
Trump just killed the Republican Party. Now please help us with voter suppression work so we can take the WH back.
Why did Trump aide, Katharine Gorka, advocate for removal of a $400,000 grant awarded to a group working to de-radicalize neo-nazis?
#whataboutism is a deflection not an answer.
For the good of our country, the Senate should remove this stain from the White House.
Don't waste your breath Senator. Do something about the man in the Oval Office who is disgracing our nation.
Senator, for the good of the country, YOU need to do everything in your power to remove this goddam lunatic from office.
