@SenJackReed I am tryin to believe you COMPROMISE IS ESSENTIAL either S2077 or S2097  how do we have $ for gas food? STOP STALLING #RenewUI
@beaachgirl5 @SenJackReed ummm 73 days now and 30 of those days senate was on vacation with no results!- Com'on! Non stop? #RenewUI
@LifeFighters4u @SenJackReed Doubting the sincerity of my own party thinkin their using this as a Nov election issue #renewui stop stalling,
@beaachgirl5 @SenJackReed I have no party- I vote where I see results. For the people? You have my vote! For self- by yourself #RenewUI
@LifeFighters4u @SenJackReed @micheleylang I have no party mostly voted Dem, however I sure as heck would love to run I am so for the PPL <3
@SenJackReed @SenatorReid "soon" is NOW! Vote #RenewUI before you go home. It is the least you could do. Waiting another week is just cruel.
@SenJackReed @SenatorReid how about giving them a boost by eliminating millions of illegal aliens working in the USA - will free up jobs
@SenJackReed @NY_Patricia guess u didn't work hard enough. My family gives u thanks for nothing. Broken promises just admit u gave up on us
@SenJackReed @SenatorReid Praying for all unemployed people in America. Please, PLEASE get this done this week. 1 more week is too long!
@SenJackReed#RenewUIAnd how is that working out?Yesterday this one & that one were tweetin'they signed.So big deal.Ukraine gets aid?Diseased
@SenJackReed  If you are truly workin hard to #renewui COMPROMISE!  S2097 is reasonable it is not about what party wins, saving lives 2M+
@SenJackReed give it up Reid ur a liar and a piece of shit like the rest of them go help the other countries before americans
@SenJackReed @OverAndAround thank you for all your support to help the unemployed all over this country. We will remember in nov. Thank you
@SenJackReed  You guys need to pull an all nighter and renew the UI extensions.
@SenJackReed @NY_Patricia working hard at not SNAPPING but its coming SOON, might be ONE more day. KEEP TALKING myself out of it #RenewUI
@SenJackReed I am so at the end of my rope with empty promises & false hope. never thought you'd leave us hanging on for dear life. #RenewUI
@seekdivinetruth @SenJackReed Cheryl, Jack is our ally. I've met him personally. He's working for us, just has an uphill battle. #RenewUI
@PleaseRenewUI @SenJackReed yes I know he is. but it's beyond frustrating at this point. talk is cheap. we can't afford to wait any longer.
@seekdivinetruth @SenJackReed I'm frustrated, too. But, I'll bet he's equally frustrated. RI has been devastated by this economy. #RenewUI
@SenJackReed @SenatorReid 1) THANK YOU WITH TEARS IN MY EYES THANK YOU.... 2) Whats next when can it pass congress please let us kmow
@SenJackReed @SenatorReid  @SenatorReid   it doesn't seem like u really want to #extendui.   Vote with the Republican extension today .
@SenJackReed Let's get this rolling...we aren't seeing any progress!
@SenJackReed both sides need to compromise and stop putting the long term unemployed in the middle of a political he said she said...
@SenJackReed Last chance to renew federal unemployment benefits at end of March http://upi.com/2898263 
@SenJackReed trying is always the excuse soon is always the answer this is very un-American #Renewui
@31merk @SenJackReed What's un-American is to expect to sit on your ass collecting perpetual unemployment benefits.  Get off your duff!
@SenJackReed  when we can't afford another week while you guys go in vacation this is disgusting.
@SenJackReed @SenatorReid Thank You
@SenJackReed @SenatorReid UI is NOT A WAY OF LIFE!! THESE PEOPLE AFTER 27 WEEKS OF UI NEED TO GO FIND A DAMN JOB!! ANYTHING AT ALL!! NO UI!!

@SenJackReed @SenateDems just for you http://www.mocospace.com/link/blog/blog_topic-view.jsp?topicid=678442&u=39090673 …
@SenJackReed @SenatorReid Unemployment insurance doesn't help our economy. Giving a fish isn't teaching TO fish. TRAIN ADULTS! Backwards!
@SenJackReed we need @SenatorReid to open vote S.2097 we urge the @SenateDems to do the right thing! #RenewUI #vets
@SenJackReed screw it I'm done physically mentally you jackasses have destroyed this nation Peace MAY GOD BE WITH YOU
@SenJackReed @SenatorReid thank you for helping us!
@SenJackReed @SenatorReid just read that nothing is going to happen till the end of March. YOU GUYS Fucking suck
@SenJackReed @SenatorReid Harry wants people to sit on their asses for as long as possible to maximize their dependence on government...
@SenJackReed @SenatorReid  this must be passed too many Americans are losing everything that they have worked for. This must be passed now!
@SenJackReed @SenatorReid please move quickly millions of Americans are suffering we feel abandoned by our country
@SenJackReed   
By the time you all do anything it's to late.  Losing our homes and everything else.  U all think climate change important.
@SenJackReed @SenateDems an expiration date. If he was working on creating jobs and you got one they sky would be the limit.
@SenJackReed @SenateDems this whole thread is pathetic and frustrating. Why aren't you all asking him to work on creating jobs?! UI has...
@SenJackReed @SenatorReid This needs to be settled before next weeks recess.
@SenJackReed @SenateDems if UI were going to boost the economy, it would have done it already. People with jobs boost the economy.
@SenJackReed Thanks to obstructions in Congress/Senate 3 million adults lost jobless aid supporting more than 1 million children! #RenewUI
@SenJackReed @SenatorReid non-stop huh better not see you in vacation next week man you guys are so full of shit!!!
@SenJackReed @SenateDems been watching the senate all day no talk of #RenewUI  yet today, comon please get it done
@SenJackReed @SenatorReid Working hard to try to #RenewUI & will continue non-stop ! but first, Eskimo child care ,fish hatcheries, etc..lol
@SenJackReed @SenatorReid It's Not gonna happen, Harry Reid thinks it's hurting Reps in the election. BUT! It's now hurt'n Dems too!

More like working hard to use the over #2million as a pawn! RT @SenJackReed @SenatorReid Working hard to try to #RenewU
@SenJackReed @SenatorReid Cut regulations, taxes, borrowing & spending huge grows Free Mkt jobs & help people so there is little need for UI
@SenJackReed @SenatorReid how is the first order of business on climate or nominations that can wait Americans who are losing homes cannot!!
@SenJackReed We rush to fund confrontations in other countries, but we do not put Americans first in relation to unemployment. Why?
@SenJackReed @SenatorReid terrible worked my whole life pay my taxes served my country and many other families have gave lives#renew now!!
@SenJackReed @SenatorReid it’s literally impossible to help an economy by paying people not go work. FYI. #economics

@SenJackReed How long do families have to go without? At this rate a three month extension will be entirely retro active. #RenewUI #failure
@SenJackReed we need to compromise with GOP. If dems are sincere any solution that gets #RenewUI done is a good solution!
@SenJackReed Thanks Senatorbut the only thing holding up this #renewUI is YOU, collectively, as politicians who are suppose to represent us.
@SenJackReed Sir please support S 2097. This is an emergency we are facing eviction #RenewUI
@SenJackReed BULLSHIT! Your all freaking talk and nothing but another CALLOUS Politician. So where you going on next weeks vacation Senator?
