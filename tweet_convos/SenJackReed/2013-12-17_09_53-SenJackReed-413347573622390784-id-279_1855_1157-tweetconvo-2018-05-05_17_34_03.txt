@HillaryClinton The GOP doesn't care anything about these kids Hillary-  And most call themselves Christians. Knowing full well all through
@HillaryClinton the bible it tells of our responsibility to help the unfortunate. They are pro birth not pro life.

@HillaryClinton @youngdems I didn't hear Hillary say a thing when Bill passed Welfare Reform. But your running for president, what timing.
@ScoutDerden @HillaryClinton @youngdems Bill did what he had to do its called Triangulation. He was a great president.
@ScoutDerden @HillaryClinton @youngdems  Hillary will be even better! It's ok to meet in the middle, be fair, use common sense.
@ScoutDerden @HillaryClinton @youngdems Hillary is for the US as a whole, for the people and not for her own political party's agenda.
@ScoutDerden @HillaryClinton @youngdems well, maybe I didn't word this part just right. She will be for her political party's agenda ...
@ScoutDerden @HillaryClinton @youngdems however, She will make intelligent common sense decisions and won't let her ego get in the way.
..@HillaryClinton if you cared about kids, maybe you would not be borrowing so much on their dime, Mrs. President
@BarbarianCap @HillaryClinton she's not president, not a senator & not Sec'y of State. So WHO is she borrowing from? #UNeedAHistoryLesson

@HillaryClinton @Wanderer19  Republicans want then2 work for food.
@HillaryClinton @Wanderer19 #GOP and @newtgingrich think they should get a job and stop mooching. Malnutrition builds character. #ToughLove
@HillaryClinton so Snap supports six total sectors of transaction for each and every sale. Value added returns.
@HillaryClinton Krugman notes studies showing 180% return on SNAP because food is grown, harvested, processed, shipped, retailed.
@MrMurder37 @Patsy1207 @HillaryClinton Food stamps are administered by USDA because was originally a farm program. Sells more food.
@HillaryClinton in terms of scale economy food stamps insure top sales returns on retail groceries.On average here 45% of total business.
@HillaryClinton @kylehillman #2SmallToFail So you have a lot to do in the US ! But at the same time, you are messing up anywhere else !
@HillaryClinton @CalebMK5

@HillaryClinton Hair Salon (Aveda) and a taxi. Yes you are right it isn't fair.
@HillaryClinton Hey, My fam was upper middle class. and my mom wanted to start a textile biz in Upstate NY. we already own 2 biz also.
@HillaryClinton @HILLARY45POTUS Why wd anyone vote for a pol who slashes food stamps and increases Big Ag subsidies for the rich--incl self?
@HILLARY45POTUS @HillaryClinton A former fundamentalist, I think most of the misinformed CHOOSE to be misinformed.

@HillaryClinton @SenJackReed get it done Hillary.  The Unemployed need your help.
@HillaryClinton Good luck finding money in the budget to feed them while coddling your friends at @GoldmanSachs $400,000 hypocrisy #ClassWar
@HillaryClinton she continues the same Obama talk..I believe she was the worst secretary of state..tell me one good think she has done.
@HillaryClinton the Clintons are smart.they always have an initiative and the money goes into their foundations & to campaigning.
@HillaryClinton  The sentiment expressed makes it unnecessary to look for the author.  Hillary Clinton is the #REAL DEAL for us 99%ers.
“@HillaryClinton: What happens to kids in families cut from unemployment insurance & food stamps? They deserve an equal chance to succeed.”
@HillaryClinton @rcooley123 GOP rather give Welfare to wealthy Oil Cos & Corprations than to needy mothers & children & ppl who are in need.
@HillaryClinton Thats to fund what the American people lost during the mean spirited Republican Govt. shut down.
@HillaryClinton @ProgressiveMass Crocodile tears. Those who rule us won't be happy until we're killing each other over crusts of bread.
@HillaryClinton @PSkipperEL  Wow! That almost sounds like Danish social-policy. :) Will the Campaign-slogan in 2016 be #2SmallToFail  ?? ;)
@HillaryClinton  I'm all in with you for 2016!!!
.@HillaryClinton @josheidelson so how about those time limits? or how total benefit receipt has to meet minimum wage?

@josheidelson NYT piece on Hillary's fight w/ teachers union, backing Iraq, gutting welfare, expanding death penatly
@HillaryClinton The kids get set up for failure. How can they concentrate in school if their tummies hurt? Shame on heartless legislators.
@HillaryClinton #2SmallToFail amazing How Hilary Clinton never condemned publicly the unbearable rapes and murder of Congolese women!
@HillaryClinton Your an intelligent woman so do tell me about equality, I want to hear all about it. I dare you to set up a meeting with me.
@HillaryClinton That conf before my mom died never discussed helping kids with disabilities Hillary & Jeb says IDEA is an unfunded Mandate
@HillaryClinton We had the Dyslexia conf. in Orlando on my birthday Nov. 13, friday the 13th which only discussed Immigrant failing NCLB
@HillaryClinton As a mother of an autistic son, Billy who is failing who had to advocate for him while others got two languages was total bs
@HillaryClinton So you championed IDEA, so why did Mr. Kennedy write into a bill that IDEA funds would be used to fund pers in a recession?
@HillaryClinton So you want some reality lets do lunch. I have a book coming out soon, and we do need to chat.
@HillaryClinton One of the people killed on Eugenics was my Scorpio Puerto Rican mother who was on disability and on medicaid.
@HillaryClinton My question to you what happens to America when asshole run the show? People die its called eugenics, and its for real too.
@HillaryClinton The playing field will never be level Hillary, and insurance and food is only a temporary fix as the problem is global honey
@HillaryClinton Ever watch the movie trading places with Eddie Murphy classic example of pricks who run the show. They are bigoted A-holes!
@HillaryClinton This country is bankrupt and Barry was put in place to fail and they used a black guy of color to take the heat of them.
@HillaryClinton Illegal aliens are not longer our problem we outsource tech to illegal people from India now, and everything is outsourced.
@HillaryClinton We cut out services for IDEA to fund Pers, while cutting all the technology to cater to migrant kids, while outsourcing tech
@HillaryClinton Second we scapegoat groups, people and even women who speak out on this topic like yours truly.
@HillaryClinton First off no one ever was given an equal chance, because those at top earn a living off screwing us over.
@HillaryClinton It will never happen, and I will explain to you why. when you get done talking to me you'll be dumb founded by my insights.
@HillaryClinton 
Great concern is being addressed! Thank you dear H.C.

@HillaryClinton @SenGillibrand If the economy had gotten better and there were jobs, it wouldn't be an issue.
@HillaryClinton food stamps should not be used as a way of life handed down from generation to generation. trust me were i work i see it
@HillaryClinton @SenGillibrand: They STARVE, regardless of whether they were welfare recipients or not.
@HillaryClinton @SenGillibrand Struggling dad's too. #2SmallToFail
@HillaryClinton  LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND NAFTA THEN!
@HillaryClinton  You and Bill should buy food, and toys for them. Let's say 3 million dollars worth. You got money.
@HillaryClinton Why weren't you speaking up for families receiving food stamps in 1996 when your husband backed Republican welfare cuts? O_o
@LeftSentThis @HillaryClinton Because "bi-partisanship" is more important than feeding the poor, decrease the surplus population, ya know?
@HillaryClinton @LOLGOP Better ask members of your party voting for the budget.   Clinton Foundation can start donating its wealth, right?
@HillaryClinton UI, SNAP, should be temporary, and these programs are one of many costing us billions. Turning into way of life for many
@HillaryClinton Ppl should not be collecting UI for 3 yrs,they don't want to work.Too many ppl are milking the system Hil, quit encouraging
@HillaryClinton here we go again with the scroogonomics on the backs and pockets of the poor and working middle class #keepingthepoordown
@hillaryclinton - #theDemocrats' social programs have created unbelievably bloated & inefficient bureaucracy of federal government
