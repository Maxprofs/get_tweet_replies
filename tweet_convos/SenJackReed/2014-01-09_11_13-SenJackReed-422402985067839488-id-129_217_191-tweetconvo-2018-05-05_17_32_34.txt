@SenatorReid There would be no pain if you dirtbags would actually work for the people.
@SenatorReid @BarackObama Thought you'd never take the gloves off, Senator. The art of negotiating is lost on these political thugs.
@SenatorReid @BarackObama Vote for Reid and become poor.  Vote for me and become rich.  100% pension and free health insurance.
@SenatorReid @BarackObama More implementation of the Cloward-Piven strategy.  Put more people on welfare so they have to vote for you.
@SenatorReid . You suck
@SenatorReid @BarackObama Please renew it asap.
@SenatorReid @BarackObama I am living it. I am a single mom, and I need UI to pay for the costs of finding a new job. Transportation is one.
@SenatorReid @BarackObama It is the fault of the Democrats that there is no job growth. Harry Reid WILL NOT GET ANOTHER TERM.
@SenatorReid @BarackObama do you two morons believe the thing you say that unemployment benefit creates jobs really tell us how
@SenatorReid Thank you! 6 months is not enough time to find work. I can't force a company to hire me. #RenewUI
@SenatorReid @saftil3322 How about the pain of not bringing stability to the jobs market? Then you wouldn't need UI.
@SenatorReid

@SenatorReid @BarackObama Why can't I get Insurance for my Wife who is my caregiver.  Our application still says (pending) ???
@SenatorReid bullshit. Get a job. Be underemployed instead of unemployed. Take pride. Don't depend on the government. You're just a slave.
@SenatorReid @BarackObama How could anyone even propose a further cut of EUC. Most of us will not even have two weeks worth of income left!
@SenatorReid @BarackObama If this extension doesn't go through or if reduced to the 31 really 21 weeks for NJ, I will literally have NOTHING
@SenatorReid @BarackObama UI have been around for years, why the controversy over it now? Find something else to cut, UI mean someone worked
@SenatorReid @BarackObama There are 339 million legal Am citizens. With .000001 of them long term unemployed I'd think of alternatives 1st.
@SenatorReid @BarackObama -focus on fraud and things like free cell phones. You need creditability to sell ideas. U don't have it
@SenatorReid @BarackObama - 5 million abortions demos say are ok are also painful
@SenatorReid @BarackObama If your ENDLESS spending would ever stop there would be JOBS for these ppl to go to! Pay them from your own $$$'s!
@SenatorReid Haven't had FT job 4 1/2yrs. Econo not supposed be propt-up by UI. America nds jobs&robust econo so ppl can be free of gov!
@SenatorReid @BarackObama UI process = epic fail. It limits what you can do to find work when you are fired unexpectedly and lose ur means
@SenatorReid @BarackObama how bout sticking w what you agreed to in October?? Oh yeah I forgot u ppl are not men of ur words
@SenatorReid @BarackObama Dinghy Harry, obstructionist cooperative schmuck in the Senate w/the perfect imitation of Piglet from Winnie Pooh

@SenatorReid @BarackObama SHUT the hell up how you going to pay for it asshole
@SenatorReid Instant karma for those making such ugly and ignorant comments. May you lose your job tomorrow. And be without for 6-8 months.
@SenatorReid @BarackObama #RenewUI
@SenatorReid @BarackObama. Let's just have unlimited lifetime UI and be done with it.
Then make a deal where you cut something useless in government spending Harry. Else you are just all talk. @SenatorReid @BarackObama
@CAAmyO @SenatorReid @BarackObama.  Amen.
@SenatorReid You whine so much that you should check to see if your wambulance is covered by Obamacare. Oh wait, you exempted yourself.
@SenatorReid @BarackObama maybe you guys need to create more jobs instead your disaster obamacare.
@SenatorReid @BarackObama I can understand their pain. UI help me pay my bills when I was unemployed, if not we would of lost everything
@SenatorReid @BarackObama Harry you are more profound talking about the joys of food shopping.

@SenatorReid You realize these people wouldn't be suffering if they had JOBS don't you? Most of them would rather have a GOOD JOB than UI.
.@SenatorReid Why is she wearing a cat on her chest?
@SenatorReid that's a much better idea than cutting the pensions of those who have actually earned it!
@SenatorReid or how about giving up YOUR salary and retirement? Cutting retirement for congress would go a long way.
@SenatorReid there are much better ways to help people than giving them a freebie. Help them help themselves. Find them a job!
@SenatorReid if you really cared about people out of work you'd repeal O'care. But since u shoved it down our throats I know you don't care
@SenatorReid so incorrect. Can @TheDemocrats balance a check book or run a company
@SenatorReid you can't pay house payments on UI unless there's 15 illegals living in the same house. Nevada #8 in home repossessions in USA
@SenatorReid what they need are jobs not hand outs. If they can't find a job they need job training. Stop encouraging laziness
@SenatorReid it's not a safety net it's a hammock
@SenatorReid And who are you blaming? you need to retire along with Obama..
@SenatorReid Only ppl not feeling pain under Admin.'including Congress, is Millionaires (Congress & Obama ).You've created Slaves!Congrats.
@SenatorReid Then do something. Like what Kelly Ayotte suggested.
@SenatorReid No $ for UI,no $ for amnesty,no $ for Obamacare. If you really care about our country&economy, you will control spending.
@SenatorReid you are the pain not the lack of benefits. Let the country breathe without ui @SenRonJohnson @tammybaldwin
