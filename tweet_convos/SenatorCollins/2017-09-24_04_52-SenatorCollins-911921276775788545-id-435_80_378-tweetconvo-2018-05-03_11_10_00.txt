Good for you on health care changes
God bless you Senator Collins. Trump embarrassed our country on his Friday tirade. You have shown class & bravery to vote "no" on Obama care
Don't accept bribe please!
Get over yourself
Bathing in liberal weasel juice miss collins.

@SenatorCollins @SenJohnMcCain @SenRandPauI @lisaMurkowski #NoGrahamCassidy #WeALLdeserveHealthCare #KillTheBill #Seniors #KidS#SaveMedicaid
You simply MUST support change Senator. Americans across this country need this. States making their own decisions is the right thing to do.
American lives are dependent on your Vote. Which way you vote literally decides if I live! Please Vote No!
I hope you plan on joining @SenJohnMcCain in opposing #CassidyGraham!
Yes stick with McCain
Join the weasels Miss Collins
YOU are a traitor to your party and to the POTUS.  
THANK YOU!!!  You're wonderful!
Thanks, Diane. Anything to defeat Mr. T's agenda. He's an embarrassment and I throw up in my mouth just a little every time I see his face.
Counting on you for your principled "no" to the latest incarnation of the dreadful health care bill!
U call UR-self a republican? Supporting a law that makes me purchase something I don't want and taking away from me options that I do want.
Such a wanna be. Think of another way to get attention ?iYou came in as a nobody and thatâ€™s how you will leave, pathetic !
@SenatorCollins needs to experience ObamaCare along with all elite Congressional Team. I'll vote 'yes' on that privilege for them.
Dear Sen. Collins, Please don't forget: the promise was repeal & replace with something better.  Where's the better?
Please Senator Collins, I am man with a several pre-existing conditions and on Medicaid, If you vote yes, i DIE!
Thank you ma'am! I appreciate what you do!
Thank you so much @SenatorCollins -- you are awesome.

Collins doesn't give a crap about the Middle Class!!!!
You / McCain? Mukowski are working for the American citizens - please keep the no votes going - thank you
Please vote no!!!
VOTE NO on GOP HEALTH CARE BILL
Please vote no
All you Senators EVER do is TALK. You don't have the desire or the INTEGRITY to DO YOUR JOB take ACTION. Just protect your jobs - PATHETIC!
Stay Strong! No on this terrible bill! Thank you!
I'll pass.
Do you have Obama Care?
We are so happy you will vote against the harmful ACA appeal which will harm women, children, elders and disabled people!
Please listen to the people of America! Many are imploring you and your fellow senators to keep/fix the ACA. Support us with your vote!
you stand with Senator McCain. VOTE NO on #GrahamCasiddy
Senator, have you scrolled through these responses? Almost every single one is opposed to the Graham/Cassidy bill! What about you?
Doctors, hospitals and insurers release a joint statement condemning Graham-Cassidy. "The Senate should reject it," they say. Vote NO!
I'm a Calif Democrat who always seems to agree with you! :-) You r so no nonsense & smart. Wish u were our President. Thank you.
OCare cut MCareAdvan plans 100% over 12yrs I recall. Poor elderly get noPrem/noDeduc ins w/someAdvan plan. Also huge cut 2MCare funded OCare
Why don't you stand true to your oath of office, and follow the constitution.? You do recall that oath and the constitution?
