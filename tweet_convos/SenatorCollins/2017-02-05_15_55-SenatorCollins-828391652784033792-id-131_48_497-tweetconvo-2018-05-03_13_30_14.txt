Haha No funding 4 traitors-Replacements already in the works./->Say Career Over!<
more wonderful to see ypu resign. How much did teach union pay you traitor?
if u vote against Devos, we vote against YOU when your up for Senate again..
With DeVos in, you have no hope of ever learning the difference between a possessive and a contraction.
Well we all can't always get what we want
You do realize that we know you and @lisamurkowski took money from teachers unions to betray us don't you?
Oh please, stop already.  You really look foolish!
No, I am blocking you so called facts!
We will NOT forget how you voted come 2018. Congratulations Sec.@BetsyDeVos @usedgov Looking forward Our Future Leaders Tku

wait when her constituents vote her out.
President Bush is a Republican why praise him you RINO traitor!
thank you for working across party lines.  will happily vote for you in the next election.
Really? They sought to assassinate Regan and take his presidency. The Bush's are traitors to freedom in my book.
Yes. Wonderful also to see you choose integrity over party. #youareachampionforchildren

It's your job to ensure ONLY qualified noms get out of committee to Sen floor.But you voted DeVos out of committee. Shameful
I used to respect you. But obvious why you voted for DeVos in committee; trying to look good to all sides. We're not fooled.
Please put unions last & country first and vote for Betsy DeVos. You know she is the most qualified candidate for the job!
you need to flip in Jeff Sessions!
Susan, get with the game this week&do the right thing! Establishment gets D- in public education. Vote4DeVos @SenatorDurbin
