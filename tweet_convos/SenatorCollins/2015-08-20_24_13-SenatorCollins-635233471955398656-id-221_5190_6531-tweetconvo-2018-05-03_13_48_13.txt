@WestPoint_USMA @LiberalMmama @USArmy congratulations
@informedblackmn @WestPoint_USMA @USArmy Jim being a vet doesn't mean you're honorable or smart. You are neither and should be ashamed
@WestPoint_USMA @Rachel__Nichols @USArmy @Brittany_Belt will like this.
@Liam_Crooks Ladies, getting it done!
@WestPoint_USMA @paulbrislen @USArmy I just hope that they don't swear.
@HamishMack @WestPoint_USMA @USArmy Anyone who makes it through ranger training gets to do what ever they want in life for ever more.
@paulbrislen @WestPoint_USMA @USArmy Exactly.

@WestPoint_USMA @ohiooldman @USArmy   GREAT
This is America. Be who you want to be
@WestPoint_USMA @PushinWeight @USArmy I thought women weren't allowed to enter combat though? Or something like that
@MichaelGeeDoe_ @WestPoint_USMA @USArmy on 01/24/13 Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta removed the military's ban on women serving in combat.
@PushinWeight @WestPoint_USMA @USArmy oh okay very interesting and good too know thank you
@WestPoint_USMA @USArmy these two women have lived the Soldier's Creed. I am grateful to see this right before I retire from active duty.
@WestPoint_USMA @JRubinBlogger @USArmy Woo Hoo!  Congratulations to ALL!
@WestPoint_USMA @Ali_Davis @USArmy WELL DONE! Is that a Sharpshooter medal I see on one??!
@The_Otter_Queen That I don't know. Dang if so.
@Ali_Davis Okay, I'm such a geek. The top one means she's a parachutist, the middle is a national defense service medal - can't find last!
@The_Otter_Queen Cool!
@WestPoint_USMA @USArmy all women are created equal and some become those ladies
