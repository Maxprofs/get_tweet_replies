Its all a show, Susan is a party girl, she lied about her retirement, She is No better than trump
Help stop CIA from using drugs from drug gangs to assault me physically, & distort my image & reputation please
Many Americans across the aisle commend your efforts right now. Sensible gun legislation should NOT be a partisan issue. TY!
thank you for doing what's right in your heart
good luck with that commie
Please stop limiting our freedom to protect ourselves and our families!
We do not trust.
I read your proposal and it is unworkable.  What about ppl that don;t have money to hire an attorney to be reimbursed.
thank you!
i admire your courage to speak up for the American people who have had enough
How can Americans trust this after #Lois Lerner & #IRS targeted conservatives & got away with it? @SpeakerRyan #NoFlyNoBuy
Why do you have an R by your name. Stop immigrants from entering USA. #buildawall #buyaguntoday #stopimmigration #stopissi
Thank you. #ProudMainer
thanks for the courage to propose this bill! An ad for free duffle bag from NRA popped up as I read the WCSH6 report!
Get a grip, woman. Try focusing on the problem of #mentalillness & radical #Islam. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=W_S-q8zElN4 …
Profile #Muslims!
You're a hero.  Thank you for your service.
@WCSH6 Sen Collins unveiled her unconstitutional proposal to help strip rights from Americans and make individuals less safe
And I wonder why @ABCWorldNews isn't including that in the coverage of the House Dems having a childish tantrum.
A democrat doing the work of democrats. No surprise here.BTW, how many mass shooters were on no fly list again? Zero.
if you want to make this country start venting immigrants and start closing mosques Rinos don't have any interest in that.
Why is D.C.'s answer to crime/terrorism always to come after innocent people?
@SenatorCollins
Is throwing tantrum thru a "sit in" the will of the people? NO "GUN CONTROL" #noguns4dems
Please note the 5th & 14th Amendment Your bill violates both 
 Resign now You have broken Your Otha of Office @theblaze
Since our treasonous gov't refuses to end influx of Muslims into US, American citizens must oppose any and all gun control!
You do not have the power to take away anyone's rights. Go home. @SenatorCollins
Get guns out of the hands of terrorists. Because "dead" is much cooler via pressure cooker bombs & suicide vests. #idiot.
Any #infringement is unconstitutional and your effort will be remembered! #2A
@KatiePavlich We must DEMAND a cooling-off period for any firearm consideration. Bowing to leftist emotion not serving USA.
I am SO SICK of self-serving pronouncements like ‘If We Can’t Pass This, It Truly Is a Broken System’ STOP IT! @KatiePavlich
.@SenatorCollins Why do you want to use BAD Lists to take RIGHTS? >> First FIX THE LIST!!  http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/07/politics/no-fly-mistakes-cat-stevens-ted-kennedy-john-lewis/ …
stop importing 3rd world muslim savages, problem solved!
So, you're ok with stripping Americans of their rights?  What's next?  Internment camps for people on the govt lists?
I'm guilty, till I can at my expense , prove my innocence... Unconstitutional.
the Democrats have taken our government hostage, they are terrorists
obama administration attacks bible toting gun loving Americans as terrorist you cant trust them
due process is a constitutional right that you are over throwing
your a traitor and a undocumented Democrat
There are 109,000 Americans on the no fly list??? #2A
Call @SenatorCollins F Graded RINO Republican for #guncontrol working for  @Everytown anti gun group
Your proposal, Didn't address the issue at all! Omar was not on he NO FLY LIST. 
And, the FBI was told multi times abt Omar
@SenateMajLdr @timkaine How does one get on, or off, a no-fly and "selectee" list Senator?
@WCSH6 what the fuck is your malfunction? #NOMOREGUNLAWS
Why did you vote against Coryn's bill that affords people due process? Why do you hate the constitution?
Innocent Americans should not have to prove their innocence in this country Senator. Shame on you. Very slippery slope.
Thank you, Senator Collins. It's a start. Now get the votes.
Anti2A bill in an election year pushed by @GOP.  
Say, you guys still curious why Trump is a thing?
NO compromise on our Bill of RIGHTS!
#ShallNotInfrige #Protect2A Stop illegal immigration! Deport visa overstays! Vet all immigrants!
no-fly, no-buy = no vote. #GuiltyUntilProvenInnocent
So your going to give up due process to democrats when it comes to our 2nd amendment? who is accountable for this list??
.@SenatorCollins When the threat facing #America is #DomesticTerrorism and #HomegrownRadicals this bill does NOTHING. #YouCanDoMore
So after you dismantle Due Process, will you be making us safer by also ending Habeas?
.@SenatorCollins drop your misguided attempts @ political points by attacking the Constitution; specifically the 2nd & 5th Amendments.
THANK YOU. 
unfortunately she rejected the real reforms needed she doesn't deserve squat. she doesn't care about americans only her seat
focus on terrorists not law abiding Americans the NRA is supported by gun owners they speak what gun owners feel
Maybe you ran out of characters but you are missing the word "Feel" before safer.
Dear @SenatorCollins, the gun debate didn't die in the Senate yesterday. It ended in 1789. Sit down and shut up. And put D after your name.
Thank you!!!!
1789
Your bill forces people to prove their incense if denied the right to buy a gun, violates due process. @Radiomattrick
@WCSH6 STOP ASKING PERMISSION TO THE NRA FOR GOD'S SAKE!!! Your #nrasugardaddy has done enough damage already.
We don't worship guns. We can worship God because we have guns- just like you can yap on twitter- thank guns
FYI people use Twitter and worship God all over the World without having to carry a gun around.
Yep, working great in North Korea and China and Iran and Syria. You anti gun nuts love that way of life
funny how you try to compare US to 3world countries. How about Western countries? Tweeting from 1 right now
RINO -- > @SenatorCollins <-- No compromise on our weapons. Muslim control, not gun control. #2A
Thank You.
@SenAngusKing thank you! #enoughisenough #disarmhate
How do we stop terrorists if you disarm us?  #tyranny #RINO
How do you deny a constitutional right without due process?  #Constitution #RINO
Safer? Stop muslim refugees & start profiling. Susie=Cher 4 pure stupidity. Difi couldn't have done better.
@WCSH6 you & your colleagues were great today gives me hope : )
.@SenatorCollins Thank you, @ChrisMurphyCT and other Senators & Reps working on legislation to promote #GunSafety .
@WCSH6   please primary Susan Collins.She must be replaced by a person that doesn't bow to BO who scrubbs mus off terr lists
Why?  BOMB THEIR ISIS ASS'S!!!
Phil, you're clueless.
So says the "self proclaimed" intellectual
Yes Philip, so say I. 
does your proposal include Internet and gun shows?  Easy go around if it doesn't.
THANK YOU !!!
Thank you for working on both sides of the aisle!
