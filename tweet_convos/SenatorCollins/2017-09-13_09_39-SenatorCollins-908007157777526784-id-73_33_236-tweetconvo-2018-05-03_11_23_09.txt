24%. That's it. And MAJORITY WANT ACA. THIS IS NOT HARD. NO GC, NO R/R, WORK ON ACA!
You are a good woman with a good heart.
 I know you will do the right thing & vote NO graham Cassidy bill. 
 Fix ACA, not sabotage
Thank you @SenatorCollins 
Sending you a hug from Florida! My husband will have his hip replaced next month & it would not be poss w/out ACA
Senator Collins please vote no on trumpcare wjhich does not cover pre-existing condition, please help the American people
SPEND, SPEND, SPEND...YOU LIBERALS ARE ALL THE SAME!
Please remember people like this when you vote on healthcare. We're counting on you to do the right thing again. G/C is a bad bill.
Yet, people currently afflicted with this terrible disease will LOSE needed Medicare Funding with the Graham-Cassidy bill. Please Vote NO.
Senior @SenJohnMcCain a hero is still fighting for all Americans. Thank you, sir. @GOP should follow in his footsteps. #CassidyGrahamNo
Sen. Collins, I saw you chairing Elder Affairs comm. while in DC for Alz Advocacy. @alzassociation is against repealing #ACA. /1
If you support people with Alzheimers getting the care they need & deserve, you need to vote NO on #GrahamCassidy. Don't contradict yourself
with #CassidyGraham Alzheimers patients like my father will die from lack of being able to afford care. Preexisting condition.  VOTE NO.
@SenatorCollins As the granddaughter of Elizabeth Levinson, I urge you to reject the anti-healthcare bill being forced on the American peopl
Please Senator, be the leader with compassion and sense who we know and vote no on #CassidyGraham
If Alzheimer's patients get screwed over by the Cassidy weathcare program, their dignified lives will be disgraced.  Cancer patients doomed.
Please vote No again on #GrahamCassidy repeal! So happy to see your work to strengthen #ACA for families like mine on it & #Medicaid-Thanks!
Please help us all in America, please vote NO on the Graham-Cassidy Healthcare bill! We women worked have to be heard, we need Healthcare!
Maine would lose $1 billion for health care under Graham-Cassidy
Thank you for that. My dad has had Alzheimer's since 2011. It's hard on all.  Can we count on your NO vote on Cassidy-Graham, Senator?
I am so sorry for your dad. My dad had it, too. It's horrible, isn't it???
It's hard. I'm sorry you and your dad went through it as well.
No Comment,,trying hard to be civil,,
That is so awesome! My dad died of Alzheimers. It's a horrific disease :(
Please vote NO on Graham Cassidy! My dad who had ALZ needed Medicaid to pay for nursing home care.
Stop straddling the fence. Do the right thing. VOTE NO GRAHAM CASSIDY .  It is not a good bill. Just vote no
Please let me live Senator Collins. I have cancer. I'm only in my forties. I will die without the ACA. Senator Collins you're my only hope
If we have no insurance we can't benefit. Please continue to put country before party.
Collins: 'Disappointing' that bipartisan health-care effort halted. 

@SenateMajLdr told @SenAlexander to walk away.
A yes vote on Graham Cassidy is a death sentence for your constituents. Their families will never forget. Is that what you went to DC to do?
#MedicareForAll!
phony. Change parties
Graham-Cassidy allows insurers to NOT cover:
-Pregnancy
-Newborn care
-Mental health services
-Prescription drugs
-Rehab
-Birth control
How will GrahamCassidy effect healthcare for those with Alzheimer's
vote no on cassidy-graham

How does Alzheimer's fare under Cassidy-Graham? Vote No.   These conditions - not so well:
Under this bill, pregnancy will cost you an extra 17K. Metastatic cancer 172K. Autism 5K. Asthma 4K. This isn't a healthcare bill.
.Please vote No on Graham/Cassidy. We need a good bill that protects those with pre-existing conditions. We need your vote!
@SenJohnMcCain @LisaForSenate  @lisamurkowski  @SenatorCollins
You saved the lives of SENIORS once before. VOTE NO !! Save the ACA
You are doing good, important work. These are preexisting conditions & those who can't pay lose care. Please vote no  #GrahamCassidy
Thanks for your support to end Alz. Please support Graham/Cassidy giving States determination of health care administration. An American.
JSYK, most people with alzhiemers, won't be able to see a Dr, when you repeal the ACA #NoACARepeal #PleaseDontRepealACA
You are a kind woman. Alzheimer's is a pre-existing condition. Vote no on Graham-Cassidy Bill. Please!

Under the latest GOP #Trumpcare bill, Cassidy-Graham, Maine would lose $115 Million in federal funding.
It's a death bill.
Good work. Protect those suffering & their families by voting no on this healthcare repeal effort. Regular order for healthcare legislation!
Graham-Cassidy will take millions off insurance and do away with protections for pre-existing conditions, including Alzheimer's. Vote NO!
Please stay strong for us and #KILLTHEBILL . Vote NO on the Graham-Cassidy bill that will be devastating for millions.
Thank you Senator Collins fir being a champion for Alzheimer's. We need our first survivor #EndAlz
so many people w/#Alzheimers rely on (#Medicaid) for nursing homes. Please be our hero again by voting No on new #grahamcassidy #ACA repeal!
and I'm self-employed, so family is on #ACA. Please work to stabilize ACA and vote no on #grahamcassidy bill; it would cut #Medicaid which/2
Sen. Collins, thank you for your efforts on Alzheimers! Please vote No again on #ACA repeal effort; husband early Alz in 50s, lost job /1
How about #RepealAndReplace your a ##wolvesinsheepsclothing and a #FakeRepublican #VoteHerOut
You seek the private sector for funding for Alzheimer's. You vote no on the repeal of O'care. What do you believe in Senator?

Should Senate Republicans that vote against tax reform lose their committee assignment? Please retweet. #TaxReform
What percentage of his  actually go for a cure?
Collins you haven't worked a day in your life!
does  he  speak   funny?
You should resign and wait for a cure. #MAGA!
You can't remember you're a Republican. You should resign and hope for a cure!
Get Obamacare off our backs now sick of this and get tax reform done We The People voted for Big Change! Your just like Dems obstructing
