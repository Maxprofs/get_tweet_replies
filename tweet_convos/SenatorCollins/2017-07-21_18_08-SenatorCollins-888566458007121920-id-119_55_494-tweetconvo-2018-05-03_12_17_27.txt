STOP GRANDSTANDING. Either YOU come up with a solution ALL will agree with or go with the MAJORITY. Called compromise and unity. DEMS do it.
Sen, why don't we see you going after the Drug companies & Mds who have made the "Opioid Epidemic" a disgrace for America? Drain the Swamp.
America is thrilled to see Susan Collins delivering so much good to ME while she sentences American doctors and patients to Medicare.
Not that it isn't a good accomplishment, but like the whole of USA is crumbling around u & u secure in personal projects oblivious 2 all!
Repeal and replace repeal repeal repeal even though the government should not be in the healthcare business
Thank you for being courageous & steadfast in demanding better healthcare for American citizens. As a breast cancer survivor, it means the 
Please stay strong and don't let this travesty go forward!
Please vote against either of the current repeal bills. Both are bad bills that don't improve healthcare. We need a bipartisan solution.
Maybe you can find a way to get them some baby parts from Planned Parenthood.
Trump marking X through grants, unAmerican, R&D and ingenuity. What will it take for a vote of NO confidence?? Majority of Am. are there now
Please vote no!! My 26 yr old will have no health ins that supports her needs without ACA
Your honesty and courage is greatly appreciated. Hopefully, your colleagues will be inspired by you to do the right for the American people.
Thank you. We need your voice to help us.
Keep up the good fight. Millions including myself depend on the ACA everyday
Please vote against this bill. Please don't take my insurance.  I can't even afford a cell phone. How will I live if I get sick. :(

Here is Susan Collins asking Obama to Repeal Obama Care -
Your constituents hope you'll continue to stand by them this week. #VoteNo
Sen. We do not want a Single Payer system!!! Work with the POTUS & the American people. Repeal & shrinking the crutch of Medicaid will MAGA.
Please stand against "repeal" as you were elected to. We've loved you so far...please keep being that person.
Thank you for standing strong against repeal of #ACA.

If I ever move to Maine, you'll be my first Republican vote in life.
Thank you for your continued courage in speaking out against those who have no problem kicking fellow Americans off their health insurance.
Thank you for continuing to stand up for affordable and accessible healthcare. You are a true leader and we need more like you. 
Susan Collins: You don't take a safety net program & change it in fundamental ways without having a single hearing. #KillTheBill
Why don't you step down fake Republican and Liar I guess as well
Why doesn't senate GOP support the constitution and the law before the POTUS?  He obviously doesn't care..but someone must.
Why isn't the Senate sharing the proposed healthcare plan with the public? Why is GOP standing behind Trump no matter how bad he becomes?
You need to become a team player instead of a maverick/obstructionist. If not you will own Obamacare! Unconscionable and unacceptable!!!
What's your take Sue? Sounds like Shelley is on the Trump train for dreathcare & Lisa is probably right behind. Are you going down that path
What will you do when Trump has Mueller fired? If you love our country, you will vote for impeachment.
So sad
To GOP Senators: Taxpayers should repeal your salary/benefits/perks for 2 yrs. We will then let u know what u will get. Deal?  Fix ACA!
I am a dedicated independent. I have voted dem and rep =. I am at a loss at what the GOP is doing. Thank you for being a rep I still trust.
hope you care enough about the ppl that are hurting from aca. this needs to be repealed.don't listen to the democrats
Why don't you vote yes on healthcare?  Most Americans can't afford it 
Time would be better spent holding a town hall in Maine where you can listen to real constituents instead of twitter trolls.
Proud to be in Maine this weekend supporting your state as you support the women of this nation.
TY!  We ask @SenAngusKing & you 2 stand firm & #ProtectOurCare. We need leaders to stop the sabotage of ACA and to craft a bipartisan bill.
Hi, Senator, We The People applaud & commend your LEADERSHIP thus far in resisting the mean & cruel 3.0 Tax Cut Bill. NOT a Healthcare Bill!
Wrong! Obamacare is a loser?
She's a shining light for what America stands for..Susan is one great caring human being and i will support anything she does in the future.
This is how democracy dies.
8- There are rumors about virtually every R Senator being lured to vote yes on MTP.

Do not be comforted by statements until the vote.
Thank you for fighting for Planned Parenthood, rural hospitals and seniors in nursing homes and Medicaid!  You are my hero!
Please lobby for a bipartisan effort to fix ACA. To vote for a bettercare plan, which is neither better nor care, or repeal spells disaster
That's nice and all, but your President is having a mental breakdown this morning... @GOP needs to get back to DC. #ImpeachTrumpNow
You promised a repeal. You are the quintessential lying politician
#TrumpcareWill harm millions. Thank you for taking a stand for what is right!
Keep glad handing that's all you do. Smile for the camera and stab your party in the back
I look forward to asking you some questions susie.
Thank you for standing up for the less fortunate across the country. You are a leader. #LetsFixACA
More taxpayer giveaways?!  20 Trillion is clearly not enough DEBT for the career Pol's who bring home the bacon!!!  Right Senator?!
I research 2 cure Cancer or Alzheimer's. But babies not kill them2 save them! U don't want to pass the health bill u  2 keep a promise!

saying people can be moved from Medicaid to Cruz plans without harm. Via @WSJ: 
Still more GOP Lying and Cheating!
Save me sign me up
Repeal Obamacare as you have promised!
Thank you so much for your courage by defending the weakest among us. If we don't take care of those less fortunate, our values are gone.
Do you do anything in the Senate other than whore for cash?
You have impressed a nation who desperately needs sane patriots! Stay strong!
You're done traitor.
Thank you for being a WOMAN of SUBSTANCE & STANDING YOUR GROUND against HORRID TRUMPCARE BILLS & devastating effects Any of them will have.
Senators visiting hospitals - great idea before a major healthcare vote! @SenatorCollins teach your colleagues! #BadAssWomenDC
Senator it is ur moral duty as a human being to ask for impeachment of DJT now or else he will destroy democracy for the future generations
History will judge you kindly and well Senator.
Stay strong in opposing GOP healthcare bill. Thank you for your leadership on this.
Trump cuts will cripple this work across the nation .@SenatorCollins @EllenMorris1222 @MaineMed @NECN
Repeal Obamacare as promised! America does not want Government Subsidized Healthcare!
Thank you Sen Collins, we are counting on you and Sen. King to be the best statesmen women in our Congress.
So now that you have $20m of our tax $, will you finally vote to get repeal OC? Its killing the middle class who can't afford to seek HC!

Six different versions of the GOP health care bill have been scored by @USCBO. Every single one would do great harm to millions of families. 
Yeah and the cbo was right on with Obamacare. They are liberal hacks just like your senator

Oregon's top health insurance regulator was in my office yesterday and said the individual insurance market is stable; DC is the problem.
Thanks for taking the time to care about our Health! We admire you for that. Protect our Healthcare,
Please!

We are ready to improve the healthcare system at any time. But we are not willing to throw tens of millions off their care to fund tax cuts. 


Schumer doubles down on his earlier calls for a bipartisan health care plan
