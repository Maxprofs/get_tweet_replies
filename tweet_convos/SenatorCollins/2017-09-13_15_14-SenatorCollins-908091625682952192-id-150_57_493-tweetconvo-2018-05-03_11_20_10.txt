Under latest Repub 'healthcare' bill if you had an UNCOMPLICATED pregnancy in the past, your premium will go up 425%
Pro-birth, not pro-life https://twitter.com/topherspiro/status/908725686311047168 …

This bill is bad. Removes all patient protections and "block grants" to states - which means cutting literally everything health-related.

Under the latest GOP #Trumpcare bill, Cassidy-Graham, Maine would lose $115 Million in federal funding.
This one is worse.  Vote no.
GOP hopes to ram through repeal vote before CBO figures out how many people will lose their insurance. Immoral—but also malevolently clever.
Please vote NO on graham Cassidy travesty. It will destroy the health care for millions of people.
Please oppose the Graham Cassidy Bill.
Mental illnesses are pre-existing conditions Please vote no on the Graham Cassidy Bill
Vote no on the Graham Cassidy bill if you care about mental http://health.You  saved us before, please do it again. Honor your friend
#NoRepeal please do not vote for yet another healthcare repeal - the American people do not want this. It will only hurt us.
Graham-Cassidy propose to repeal Obamacare by 30th. @LAFG46 @JeffFlake @lisamurkowski @SenSasse @SenatorCollins @SenAlexander @SenJohnMcCain
Huff Post discusses.
Americans are counting on you to once again vote NO w/regards to HC.  This latest bill is even more cruel than the last.  Please stand firm.
Senator, you were a heroine last time on ACA repeal.  I pray you remain a hero.  Lindsay-Graham bill is equally if not more toxic. Unfair!
https://soundcloud.com/user-548478055/mobilize-trumpcare …
Trump care is about the greed of millionaires.  The American people need a guillotine on the national mall, and it needs to be used!
Graham-Cassidy would be devastating to the mentally ill.  Pre-exist conditions discrim and guts to Medicaid and exchanges.  PLEASE vote NO!
Do you oppose the latest merciless ACA Repeal attempt?
Protect the ppl of Maine. Vote no #GrahamCassidy
I think that Senator Collins will step up this time as well. But I don't know about John McCain.
Vote no on Graham Cassidy.
Use your position to support health coverage for *all* Americans. Vote no on Graham Cassidy.
House members are home this week. These members' states would be *devastated* under #GrahamCassidy. You know what to do. Spread far & wide.
Please remain strong and vote No to G/C bill.

Wait:
Graham/Cassidy gives insurance companies the right to raise your premiums the minute you get sick?
If so, monstrous. https://twitter.com/topherspiro/status/909082137311285248 …
A vote for Graham-Cassidy is a vote against the mentally ill. If you actually care, vote no.
You promised to work on a bipartisan solution for health care. Graham-Cassidy is NOT it. Please stay strong for us and VOTE NO!
Please oppose Graham-Cassidy. Be a hero again!
AARP stands ready to work with Congress on commonsense, bipartisan solutions to improve health care.

#GrahamCassidy is not that bill.

This goes far beyond the BCRA, McConnell's bill that failed. It is the complete wiping out of protections for pre-existing conditions. https://twitter.com/TopherSpiro/status/908718687116505090 …
This is what happens with pre-existing conditions. Please vote no. This will price millions of us out of health care.

#GrahamCassidy is just another bad bill that would  costs &  coverage. We urge Congress to reject it & the flawed approach it represents.
Are you still against trumpcare?
Mental illnesses are pre-existing conditions that would cause many to go w/o treatment, including therapy and medication. Please vote no!
No #GrahamCassidy
.@SenatorCollins opposed #TrumpCare the first time, and she should oppose #Graham-Cassidy. #Maine, ready to ?
Please Senator Collins, I implore you to oppose the Cassidy-Graham bill. It's an atrocity & it will hurt people.  Please do the right thing
Please do not vote for Graham/Cassidy ACA Repel.  This is going to hurt so many of us!  I have many pre-existing conditions /1
i.e. no working thyroid, must have regular check-ups and it caused Graves Disease, plus other pre-existing conditions. This plan has no /2
Please vote no on the New bill! Americans want bipartisan solutions
The Graham Cassidy amendment would be worse than a complete repeal.  https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/cassidy-graham-plans-damaging-cuts-to-health-care-funding-would-grow-dramatically-in …
Please honor his memory and vote against this new repeal/replace bill that will make mental healthcare harder to get!
Senator, please oppose Graham Cassidy.  No federal protections on lifetime caps or pre-existing conditions. Premiums will go up for less cov
No on Obamacare repeal! No on Graham Cassidy Kill repeal once and for all. Don't hurt people!
As a Mainer with mental illness I appreciate you noting his support of it and urge you to push for health care that supports it also.
Shillsan, Shillsan, Shillsan.  Just as I have been saying. You are nothing but a shill for the GOP. Who would die w/o constant war.
The Cassidy/graham healthcare bill is not a champion of mental illness; no protections for essential care including mental health #voteno
The Graham Cassidy amendment would be a full repeal without replacement.
They are at it again.  I hope you stand firm.
This.  Support us, not the insurance industry and millionaire CEOs.
I asked people to share what it's like to live in a country with universal health care. The responses that came in were incredible. 
You own Obamacare and you know it's a loser!!! What are you doing to fix it? Nothing!!! Unconscionable! All Americans will be harmed
Hello, funny this is your first tweet. I've just opened a new account w/the intent to tell my side of the story,
+to explain Y I no vote HRC
Everyone needs insurance - for mental and physical conditions.
Vote NO on the Graham proposal.
Do the right thing.
So important to fight for those with mental illness, since hardly anyone does!
Before u bring the gavel down there's always been something missing 
Patricia deserves an opportunity to tell her side +explain Y NoVoteHRC
#DefundPP
Since you screwed so many over with the healthcare repeal can I have your 12000 you get for healthcare I could use healthcare
Since you are a closet dem help you prez ..you can be innocent
Turncoat Susie, did you get lost on the way to Washington? There are a lot of bills to be voted on and you're out playing.Approval rating 8%
She's got a 78% approval rating in Maine.  You're about 70% short.
Over all, maybe in main. Because she never leaves. There is a lot more important items on the table than Maine
Traitor ! We don't believe traitors. We want forget!
Senator Collins, I am aware of his work for mental illness. I have Bipolar Disorder. Thank you for this tweet. You have my highest respect.
But we won't miss you... It was your Senate vote that failed to repeal Obama care... VOTE HER OUT!
Unlike YOU!
So this means you are a no on the new Graham gut Medicaid/HC bill?
Why didn't you tell everyone how you voted against the Constitution, on Rand Paul's war authorization amendment today?
That's a very good question
Thank you from NM
Please spend more time with Tom useless over the hill out of touch politician. RETIRE
