@SenatorCollins - #GrahamCassidy raises premiums for cancer pts by $142,000/year. Please vote no. Without ins or cash, cant receive chemo/tx
Not true, will not increase premiums.  It will put healthcare back to the states.
Linda, it does increase premiums for those with pre-ex conds exponentially. Erases all protections from insurance Co's. Look at orgs against
All liberal organizations that wouldn't agree with the president no matter how good his plan is.  Obamacare is imploding.  Let people get their insurance in a free market, competition, premiums will come down.
VOTE YES ON G/C AND TWEAK IT LATER! Even if it is SLIGHTLY BETTER than ACA you can TWEAK it later!!! Do nothing and be seen as A LIAR!
my grandsons are being adopted to strangers instead of us because I exposed their lies and mistreatment.
ask your DHHS why a grandmother can't use freedom of speech to tell the abuses the family suffered from them.
yet DHHS CPS in good ol Maine prevented us from caring for our grandsons because I spoke with media about case.
One thing grandparents need to raise kids is healthcare for all, not just the wealthy and senators
