As a Canadian living in Maine I know CAN will give me and US wife healthcare.Pathetic that her own country cannot provide this #SinglePayer
Exactly. I love ME but may have to move to CAN and settle with my b/f there because I can't afford healthcare.. and I'm working!!
Ironically I get healthcare through work here, but if my wife were to ever get ill, she has Canadian healthcare.most likely retire in canada
Its sad when I'm a working person that has to consider leaving my family,my job and my home just to stay healthy because my state won't help
how much of my tax dollars  going to go to u Mainers-to create those jobs-that isn't the solution to Maines underemployment-redist wealth?
REPUBLICANS HAVE UNQIUE & HISTORIC CHANCE TO CHANGE AMERICA FORVER BY CREATING A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM WHICH IS THE ENVY OF THE WORLD..GOLDEN
STOP. LYING. There are hours on youtube of the ACA hearings with both parties attending. Hours .. I can post them.
“We should not repeat the mistake that President Obama made in passing major legislation with no support from the other party”
Susan Collins
When are you switching parties to the demorats? Not a shred of conservatism in you or your ideas
She's not a democrat. She feigns concern to hold her seat because Maine is strongly liberal... but she almost always votes party lines
60% is not almost always
As someone who has suffered since LePage did not accept Medicaid expansion please do not sideline our healthcare issues.
For many, the problem is not whether they have a job, it's that they can't sustain a living and afford healthcare even WHILE working
When did the GOP start replacing actual empathetic, responsible people with body slammers, pussy grabbers and beach closers?
Step 1: Prevent economy-stifling personal bankruptcy due to health care expenses.
^this. I've been working on an injury for an entire year now. Using ER as primary care is reality for so many Mainers.
Love the people you are swornto serve. Vote NO on mitch's disreputable killing bill
You are no Republican you are a Democrat!
@POTUS get us another person when she is up for re-election!
You know what treason looks like?

Refugees on the left              ........         Jews on the right 

What are you doing supporting Trump?  Really, what?
Senator time U Republican Dopes wake up & give AMERICA A GOLDEN HEALTH CARE PROGRAM  which will change AMERICA FOR EVER its YOUR LEGACY..
Americans now see GOP as party of TERMINAL weakness - Party who just stands by as our Democracy is taken over by a hostile foreign Dictator
Thank you Mrs. Collins, we need to find out what is going on there's too many meetings with the Russians
Get rid of Obamacare and stop helping the Democrats make life more difficult for the president!
Do your job investigate Obama or you are misrepresenting and a complete embarrassment.  My god how do you look in the mirror? Obstructionist
Susan Collins a Democrat in Republican Clothing!
When will Collins push for investigation Clinton/Lynch collusion. Obama admin unmasking of American Citizens.
Just stopping by to say I admire your stances & hope conservatives of your ilk will rebuild a platform for the true con voice post Trump.
REPUBLICANS WILL WIN IN LANDSLIDES IF THEY CREATE A SUPER HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM. IT NEEDS TO BE LOADED A GOLD STANDARD MAKE AMERICA GREAT
What a great looking group Susan!!
Thanks for calling for Senate Intel to interview Trump Jr, Manafort, & Kushner about meeting with the Kremlin lawyer. We need the truth! 
Great, but how about a town hall so more constituents can talk with you and ask questions?
I am ashamed of the #GOP2017 . 
#TrumpRussia
Nobody can treat people like this and claim to be a government for the people.
you do your job for the Citizens of the United States and  repeal Obama
I wish u could talk little faster...ur accent sometimes works for slow talkers but not for u.. cant listen to u at all..I dont have all day
Sen Collins, it's not true what you said about Pres Obama's AHA--many hearings were held, GOP amended it, & it's a GOP idea, Gov Romney, MA.
You need to run as a Democrat because you are no Republican.

If Congress wants to keep the individual insurance market stable, it may not actually be such a heavy lift.

Save our healthcare- I LOVE my ACA! Vote no
More jobs way to go not expanding Medicaid. Move if ur politicians can't bring jobs, should be embarrassed to be on Medicaid if able bodied
The new healthcare bill will kill thousands of seniors who can't work and won't be able to afford nursing home care w/out Medicaid.
repeal Obamacare & more jobs will be created, Medicaid is not being cut, just the rate of incr, I spprt Cruz/lee amend
Never Collins again !
Please protect our nation's health care - protect poor children, older people, the disabled

Keep the Medicaid extension by charging based on income. Everybody can afford something. In countries with Universal care everybody pays.

Great. But we are losing our country and you won't act. #HistoryWillExcoriateYou
Wow. A searing assessment of the President of the United States by political editor @CUhlmann of Australia's ABC. 
Sen. Collins, you stand apart :  Lieberman/Collins
why is this happening?
So enjoy reading what Senator Collins does for her constituents. SC's not afraid to be out there & talk. Life can look "normal". Tnx! @cnn
Plz fight 4 health care 4 all Mainers! Remove cap gains elim 4 wealthy! We r counting on u! @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse #ACA #ResistTrump
What the heck is Ivanka doing attending G20 meetings?
This is outrageous and is just lowering the bar of the highest office in the land.
I know you say you will fix health care but you know that is not true the U.S.A. has been 50 out of 55 country's baby's dying SIDS 20 of 27
and look at all those women in the room.  Keep using your voice for all of us.
Make me laugh
You are not interested in jobs except for you own. You stand for austerity and permanent war. Please look in a mirror and admit it.
Maine is done
Sen. can you please put more pressure on Trump.  He is doing so many things wrong .  We all know he's unfit for office.  Has no ethics .
I LOVE that you are meeting with engaged constituents...not the norm, at the moment.
Sorry, Sharon, I typed the same thing just now. Didn't see your comment 1st. I enjoy seeing her role-model for republicans :) . That's truth
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare #BCRA #AHCA #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
To be clear, Obamacare isn't failing. @realdonaldtrump is sabotaging it. 
So important. Your willingness to #VoteNo on #BCRA will save many ME jobs, particularly In rural hospitals.
She won't vote for it she has a caddy plan !
Veterans Administration is a government ran retirement/ Healthcare system that has failed! You want this for all Americans? Are you sure?
GOP took decades2admit IraqWar a mistake- awaiting their2027 revelation thatTrump was even bigger one. GOP willB Unelectable for DECADES.
So what ideas did you all come up with?
Americans Rpaying VERY Close attention 2TrumpsTreason, dissing our Intel Comm over his buddy Putin on FOREIGN Soil & GOP utter spinelessness
Hooray Susan!
That's fantastic! Now let's get the crazy man out of the White House before he gets us all killed.
Great to see a Senator meeting with and listening and working on behalf of her constituents. Class act!
Thank you Senator!

This is the seminal image of our battle. She’s being arrested for protesting ACA repeal outside McConnell’s office. https://twitter.com/desiderioDC/status/877914158787842048 … 
Refugees are fleeing for their lives. I am ashamed of this ban.
Thank you for your work. When will you have a town hall?
Stop calling the #refugeeban a "#travelban" ... Refugees are not going on a vacation. Refugees have no homes to return to.
dt is sending people back to nowhere land.Not part of my values & not logical 4 most of us. We keep apologizing 4 dt - he's not who most are
Trumpcare will lose jobs. #MedicareForAll would create jobs.
Medicare is for people who have worked for years and paid into, not a bunch of freeloaders.
