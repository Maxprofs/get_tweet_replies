Politicians stood idly by as #Hitler began chipping away its gov structure just like @realDonaldTrump's doing.
This country is on the same path as Germany was after #WWWI. #Hitler was freely elected like @realDonaldTrump.
This is a pathetic stretch. You should give it up,Space.
Not giving up and will not stand idle while ignorant people like you try to deter me.

Your silence, and reading this tweet after reading about pardon and Arpaio's sadistic behavior, makes me literally sick to my stomach.

Senator, you are one of the brave few. Surely you must see this pardon is a dangerous precedent. Please help to save our country. Please.
Susan too bad u wont last too long in the swamp. Also how disappointing is u won't support POTUS thus HURTING Republican Party
You are silent about the Arpaio pardon. Disappointing. Has your GOP become the party of racism and torture?
Enjoy it, it'll probably be your last one as a sitting senator. After promising to repeal and replace,  and changing ,you won't win again 
Hey forgot about this BS work with tromp and fix this country if you want to see me vote for you again
Please speak out against Trump flouting the law. He is testing the waters. What will you do when he pardons Flynn, Manifort et al?
The highlight was not voting to fix healthcare.
Harvey is a major hurricane and you tweet free lobster photo op . I wonder what your response would be if it was the president doing that ?
the president is on vacation, golfing again.  he is a disgrace.

Heartbroken Senator that potus so abused his power and pardoned that vicious racist. Please speak up senator.
LOBSTER!?!
While the leader of YOUR Republican makes a mockery of the Constitution, Law and Order?
What? No cake "Marie Antoinette?"
How nice. Meanwhile your president  pardoned a racist, is dumping DACA, banned able-bodied patriots from serving, & told Texans good luck!
I'm still hoping to be able to afford healthcare soon.
Oh how sweet susie
Stay where you are and resign!!
Get used to baking because you're gonna get baked in the next election! Then you can feel like the lobster.
OMG that looks like fun how about working on Healthcare repeal-and-replace as promised
Attention Ms. Collins. You must re-register to vote (fill out a   registration form) if you wish to  change your political party affiliation
Sen. Having fun!
.great show!  It was fun to listen to! I still haven't had a lobster this summer!
Rather be in front of the camera then working to fix our Medicare right!
Did your lobby money pay for that?  #RepealAndReplace #FakeRepublican #VoteHerOut
The Democrats have already left you Senator Collins.
You're only hero for a while when you do something for them
Save a few for those folks who don't have Obamacare
We want forget you! Traitor!
How about health care reform?
Try something meaningful like voting Yes to healthcare.
What a joke!!!
Why are you not at work getting all of the president nominee's through! We the people work everyday, every week!!!!!
You have demonstrated = self-serving and part of the Hate Party=Democratic Party-have the decency to resign as a GOP standard-despicable!
Progressive =communist!
Mean while the country still goes to work to feed their family. Struggle every day. Still have O'care. Your not helping the president!!!
U need to be the boiled lobster after that hcare vote. Last term for you.  Win for Maine.
bsing as usual, we have to get you out of the senate
Betrayed the people by not keeping your word to repeal the disaster known as Obamacare. Resign.
I need to visit my cousins in Maine. Those lobsters look yummy.
Democratic Senator Susan Collins is trying to entertain us with her highlight of the summer. Try helping out the Republicans next time.
Meanwhile ur president is....
Last minute news @editorpressnews
Yum! Stay strong Susan, you're one of the few Republicans that I like.
That's not a compliment sue, you are voting with the obstructionist.  Last cycle, maybe run as a democrat. More honest.
Okay, I'm jealous.
You are an excellent representative.
. You blocked Obama care reform Senator Collins what are you going to do about it?
