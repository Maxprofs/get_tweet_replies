You took $41,000 from the #NRA?

41,000?

You should never speak on gun violence again. Your just another greedy legislator.
@HappyOldSoul @SenatorCollins   One can Get a used conscience cheap these days.
Then stop taking #NRA money, pass gun control legislation, & stop making speeches that mean exactly nothing, please.
...
If you take money from the NRA you are uniquely UNQUALIFIED to help this nation move forward with common sense gun control.
I hold you personally responsible for this. The blood is on your hands. #NRApaidforyourtweet
You took $41.5K from the NRA. How much would it take to buy your vote for sensible gun laws? #gunsense
All talk; no action :(
Your statement is worth nothing. Shame on u for voting NO to common sense gun laws. How many more incidents till u vote YES?
How much per life did you get from the @NRA to stop you passing laws that would prevent this? #lawsnotprayers
have a look at the UK gun laws and learn! we had Michael Ryan after that we stock of our laws straight away! look learn
Grow some balls.
because of your inaction on gun laws, you're equally responsible for these & thousands of other murders since Sandy Hook.
guns don't kill , people thoughts and ideas kill.. if it wasn't a gun it would of been something eales.
any comments from you on shooting .... Have no meaning.  Enough is enough. Do something about the guns!!
I’d say something here, but it’s clear you don’t care about people. Enjoy your $41,000. 50+ are dead because of your vote
The FBI has numerous warnings, but this PC culture ties their hands
#Orlando
Corrupt @SenatorCollins has blood on her hands for accepting #GunMoney and enabling terrorism and mass murder! VOTE HER OUT OF OFFICE
please stand up against the gun lobby and vote to enact common sense gun reforms like universal background checks
Then stand with the @SenateDems against gun violence and pass sensible gun laws! #filibuster

@SenatorCollins
@SenatorCollins
You're a fraud - turn down the @NRA money and fight their hate.
so do something.
the @nra spent $41,600 on buying this Senator.
Your donor list shows you do not give a shit about this stop lying
NRA whore!
For $41,600, the @NRA bought your gun against gun sense. Go stuff it..
Suze Baby... return the $41K to the NRA then i might believe you're sincere
Hypocrite!!
stand up to the NRA and support universal background checks and gun safety measures
This tweet funded by the NRA. There's blood on your hands. DO SOMETHING. #GunReformNOW
@SenatorCollins
.@SenatorCollins go wash your bloody hands now
How about sucking up the courage to stand up to the #NRA and take High-Capacity clips away from mass shooters? Restrict AR15
is $41,000 worth the lives of 50 people to you? Stop being a coward and stand up to the NRA. Stand up for human life.
and what, exactly, are you going to DO about it? Other than shill for the NRA?
hypocrite
Seriously? NOTHING about gun control? We elected you to act on our behalf. Do so or we'll replace you with someone who will.
.@SenatorCollins Your silence on gun control means that more violence will be inevitable. Do the right thing. Do your job.
We can stop future acts of terrorism like this by supporting and passing gun control laws. Please. Mainers are sensible.
Disappointed that you took $41,000 from the NRA. That means you're part of the system that allowed this tragedy to happen
Start doing your JOB representing people (who, btw, are vulnerable to bullets) and NOT THE NRA!!!
I bet you feel real good about yourself taking over $40,000 from NRA
.@SenatorCollins took $41,600 from @NRA. Her statement doesn't acknowledge problem of easy gun access for terrorists
Hey Susan, put your (blood) money where your mouth is. Donate the $41,600 the NRA gave you to @equalityfl.
Hypocrite. Abdicate your position.
Taking $40K from the NRA makes you seem like a fool when you make a compassionate statement like this. Get real. Legislate!
as a smart lady please do something about all these war weapons in our society. NRA represents gun makers.
does having $41k in NRA blood $ sooth your soul? Thoughts & prayers is bs. Do your job. #NRApaidforyourtweet
You took over 40,000 from the NRA and refused to vote for a bill making it hard for terrorists to buy weapons. #ownedbyNRA
you took $41,000 from the @NRA don't pray ask yourself Why!!
.@SenatorCollins you voted against high-capacity magazine ban. You hold Margaret Chase Smith's seat. Where's your declaration of conscience?
#Hypocrite
will your heartbreak translate into action on gun control or will you keep taking those @NRA  checks? Do more than pray!
Stop talking, start doing. Stop taking NRA money. Pass legislation so this doesn't happen again. #guncontrol #Orlando
Common sense gun laws, please. Be an example to your fellow moderate Republicans and do something.
your words are hollow, you @NRA shill. YOU and people like you are why guns are still on the street, killing our families.
You have accepted over $40,000 in NRA blood money.
