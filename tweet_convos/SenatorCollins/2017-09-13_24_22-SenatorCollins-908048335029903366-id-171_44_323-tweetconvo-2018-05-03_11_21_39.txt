@Michell_Bocik nice message I'm agree with you to U.S. SENATOR MS. SUSAN COLLINS to vote no to repeal and replace ACA thank you so much
$400 million to GOP campaign from Koch brothers on condition ACA is repealed. Don't cave! VOTE NO on #GrahamCassidy! Please do what's right.
Amen
Please vote no to Graham-Cassidy bill - that bill will take the ability for care away from so many who need it.
I can't find a single plea to vote FOR the cruel Graham-Cassidy healthcare bill. People are scared and begging you to vote NO again. Save us
Imagine if all the people who've helped with your work on addiction couldn't have access to basic medical help.
Likely all gone with Graham-Cassidy...
Did you get the Award from Chuck Schumer or Nancy Pelosi?
Cassidy-Graham #DeathCare will not cover Addiction Treatments. It will not cover even the Essentials No Maternity No Women's Specific needs
Very nice to keep in mind with compassion to vote no to repeal and replace ACA thank you so much U.S. SENATOR MS. SUSAN COLLINS GOD BLESSYOU
Yet, the new Republican HealthCare Bill decreases treatment coverage for addictions. Please Vote No.
Thank you, Senator, for keeping up the fight!
don't let the latest healthcare bill reduce treatment & price out pre existing conditions -- keep it nationwide!
Please vote no on ACA repeal. Ty from Arkansas!!!
thank you!! please keep these resources in mind and vote no on gop bill to repeal and replace aca. We can do so much better to improve aca.
It will go away if you don't vote NO!
Vote no on this bill because it will end coverage for addiction treatment - & maternity, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, mental illness...
I hope you realize #GrahamCassidy would be DISASTROUS for ME. Any gains you've made in fighting the opioid crisis would vanish.
Please don't fall for the Graham Cassidy bill, it doesn't cover pre existing conditions. You are our only hope.
WHAT about expanding health care for all Americans? Graham-Cassidy harms millions and removes pre-existing conditions protections. Vote NO!

REPEAL REPEAL REPEAL!  VOTE YES!!!  Stop forcing American's to be and do things they don't want to do. This feels like Communism. Power?
I have to pay extreme premiums/deductibles while OTHERS get great insurance? I am unable to get prescribed MRI for possible spine cancer.
DEATH PANEL
This is why it's important that we keep Medicaid funded.  Please continue to vote against the ACA repeal.
Remember how proud & honored U were returning 2 Maine after ur heroic NO vote--We need you again 2 B the voice of reason in DC!! PLZ!!
What good is it if we don't have ESSENTIAL BENEFITS PREEXISTING CONDITION PROTECTION CAPS? NO CARE!
PLEASE VOTE NO!#GrahamCassidy
Congratulations and I'm sure you will remember #GrahamCassidyBill will take all that away vote #noGrahamCassidy continue to make us proud

13/ @SenJohnMcCain @lisamurkowski @senrobportman @SenAlexander And that's exactly where we will take it. And @gop WILL LOSE. BADLY.
Please standup against the Graham-Cassidy bill. GOP will own it, please take the  time to come up with a plan that protects Americans
12/ @SenJohnMcCain @lisamurkowski @senrobportman @SenAlexander You will not win a battle over this in a court of law, or public opinion.
11/ @SenJohnMcCain @lisamurkowski @senrobportman @SenAlexander We asked nicely before for No votes. @GOP kept on anyway. DONE asking nicely.
10/ @SenJohnMcCain @lisamurkowski @senrobportman @SenAlexander And yet @GOP keeps up the bs. WE. ARE. DONE. WITH. YOUR. BULLSHIT.

..Even with a FDA-APPROVED APP! I can't believe they wasted the money when they want to dump the FDA, too., **SAD** DON'T let them do it!
Aftercare, then 12 - step programs are very helpful and FREE, and there are 100s of free apps. No addict gets off drugs alone in a room....
I'm NOT surprised, because your @SenateGOP colleagues want to save $$$$. I'm sure you know TREATMENT is almost always needed, plus...
Last thing you can't cure opioid addiction with an APP, but even if it IS FDA-approved!! I can't believe someone decided that - - well...
for reading this far and PLEASE, don't vote to repeal THE ACA!!!
... because it isn't COVERED under the AHCA! Neither is having a baby or ANY hospital care. Pay out-of-pocket or die. Thank you so much...
.... the very wealthy 1%. I guess the rest of the @SenateGOP doesn't care quite as much as they said they did about opioid addiction...
PLEASE stand with us again and vote NO on the ACA repeal! Its replacement will make insurance out of reach for almost everyone, except...
Thank you Senator for courage on ACA repeal! Please vote NO on new bill-cuts addiction treatment- would cause millions to lose coverage!
The new bill will not help those who suffer from addiction. Please vote no.
You won't expand any treatments if you vote for graham-Cassidy.
We love what you've done to protect our healthcare. Please keep it up and oppose #GrahamCassidy .
Please vote against Graham/Cassidy healthcare bill that deprives millions of healthcare & removes protection for pre-existing conditions.
Please stand up for our healthcare. My family needs you to say No to the Cassidy bill
Since you are working to expand access to addiction treatment, can you confirm you are a no on #GrahamCassidy? It does not do that.
Please continue the fight for healthcare that we deserve,  not corporate controlled policies like #GrahamCassidy that puts profit over lives
Support #MedicareForAll so no American has to suffer!
Thanks and please do everything you can to block #GrahamCassidy. It still takes away insurance from millions. Just #SaveACA and improve it.
Senator Collins, please vote no on the Graham-Cassidy healthcare bill. As I am sure you are aware, the bill would be harmful to millions. TY

Congratulations. Remember that the national battle with opioid addiction will be lost if Graham-Cassidy becomes law.
Not insurable according to @SenateGOP. #noGrahamCassidy
Senator Please vote No on GrahamCassidy
Please do not vote yes for the current  Trump care bill.

Under the latest GOP #Trumpcare bill, Cassidy-Graham, Maine would lose $115 Million in federal funding.
It's happening.  Again!!!
GOP hopes to ram through repeal vote before CBO figures out how many people will lose their insurance. Immoralâ€”but also malevolently clever.
Thank you. Now don't let your caucus take healthcare from millions!!!
Sen., pls do everything u can 2 save us from yet another healthcare ramrod loaded w/cruel features.
Here we are again. Another AWFUL healthcare plan. Please #VoteNo
Or are you lining your coffers w/taxpayer dollars supporting rehabs q/95% fail rate and Suboxone w/66% failure rate?
Please visit Fort Snelling to identify deaths by the falsified opioid epidemic. In 2012 the VA began denying PAIN  MEDs & vets DIED! @POTUS
Senate knew in 2008. House knew in 2012. They ignored because it does not generate $$$ for their coffers. Denying pain MEDs = DEATH SENTENCE
We need #Medicare4All . There is literally no future for those that suffer with addiction and can't afford care.

This is a movement!
#TrumpArmy wants @realDonaldTrump agenda passed!  #Congress pay attention or get primaried
We're NOT DNC or GOP ideologs 
Please don't vote for a health bill that takes away our health care.
Senator, addiction treatment coverage will be lessened by #GrahamCassidy . Please VOTE NO

Wait:
Graham/Cassidy gives insurance companies the right to raise your premiums the minute you get sick?
If so, monstrous. https://twitter.com/topherspiro/status/909082137311285248 â€¦
Tell your constituents you will #SaveOurCare

This goes far beyond the BCRA, McConnell's bill that failed. It is the complete wiping out of protections for pre-existing conditions. https://twitter.com/TopherSpiro/status/908718687116505090 â€¦
Flipping on healthcare 2 vote w/Dems, Susan has exposed herself as a Swamp Dweller.  Doesn't work in our best interest.  Vote her out, unite
Even under AHC, congress found a "way around".  They illegally applied for HC under small business status 4 themselves & staff.  Saved 12K.
Single Payer will not B the healthcare of congress, or the wealthy.  They will use doctors in pvt practice, treat only pvt payers.  We wait.
Consider all the savings to Gov, if they cull population of the elderly?  Save social security & Medicare.  Just 1 unfortunate accident?
If we give our healthcare 2 Gov, they can cut out any expensive, unhealthy group, w/unfortunate accident; contaminated vaccines or drugs?
SP/UK lost 2400 Hemophiliacs from AIDS tainted blood.  How does this happen to so many, 20yrs after screening?  Culling population?
If Single Payer healthcare is "free", why do Brits get AIDS test kits from vending?  Y not C a "free" doctor?  No disease or partner control
Susan voting w/Dems on HC, means our future is Single Payer.  Uk has SP HC, they have AIDS epidemic, offer AIDS test kit in vending machimes
Dem Keith Ellison caught on hot mic revealing, Pelosi favors Single Payer HC,  but she's not ready 2 reveal intentions to constituents? 2Bad
Susan joins Dems 2 vote 4 Obamacare.  AHC can't survive unless taxpayers pay pvt insurers 2 insure us & pay high premiums?  Corp. welfare!
You could be the next POTUS please don't let America down. Vote no to the cruel healthcare plan.
Please continue to put people over party the elderly deserve dignity and respect not worry over ending up homeless and alone.
How Trumpcare Will Affect Mental Health https://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2017/03/09/how-trumpcare-will-affect-mental-health/#.Wbzc8c0i_Go.twitter â€¦ With no healthcare addiction will be worse add access to guns to the mix.
please do not vote for the horrible new Graham healthcare bill! We need your help! #VoteNo
We need a bipartisan solution to stabilize the markets and protect the healthcare of vulnerable Americans. Please vote No on Cassidy-Graham.
HELP is doing good work. Graham/Cassidy not. Repeal and replace was wrong before and it's wrong now! Vulnerable Mainards are counting on you
We can't trust congress2o administer our health programs.  They R too crooked.  Universal healthcare, U will get what U pay 4, just like VA
(3) Congress members & staff, filled out inaccurate personal informtn to qualify as small business?  DC Health Benefit Exchange, none denied
(2) They were given a "work around" by Office of Personnel Mgmt.  Allowed them 2 keep FEHB & sign up as small business of 50/less employees.
(1) Under AHC, Congress, no longer allowed 2 use Fed Employee Health Benefits.  When Congress realized they wld lose employer contrbn, 12K
This is what Susan just signed you up 4.  By not voting w/Replcns, she has doomed U 2 HC @ congress discretion.  Vote her out!  Dem not Reln
Wealthy will get best doctors, Universal HC will get Doctors w/bad credentials.  1% of surgeons responsible 4 32% malpractice, claims paid!
When Dems & Susan take U 2 free healthcare, she will not B using.  Doctors R already going 2 pvt practice.  Wealthy will retain like lawyers
UK also lost 2400 Hemophiliacs to AIDS tainted blood?  How does this happen 2 so many, 20yrs after screening?  Culling the population?
(2) Uk has Universal HC.  They also have AIDS epidemic.  Offering AIDS test kit in vending machines?  Y not C "free" doctor?  No control!
(1) Susan voted to keep Obamacare.  As a result, Dems will move Americans into Universal healthcare, "free" HC.  B 4 U get excited, consider
Overdose deaths; 1999-4K, 2010-16K, 2014-33K, 2015-47K & 2016-63K.  This epidemic was foreseeable.  Cost 2 our HC, 45B.  Punish Pharma 300B!
U should B punishing Drug Industry 4 watching obscene profits soar w/o reporting  problem.  Controled substance must start w/Pharma industry
Pharma sold enough opioids 2 medicate "every" American for 3wks, 24 hrs a day! Let's not pretend, doctors didn't know opioids R addictive!
U hypocrites R giving each other awards, while drug industry is killing Americans w/opioids.  Pharma knew about problem & so did doctors.
Congratulations, Senator Collins!
Is that award for lying to the American people #RepealAndReplace #wolvesinsheepsclothing #FakeRepublican #VoteHerOut
TY, Senator, for your stand to #ProtectOurCare including treatment for substance abuse
This bill will cause thousands of premature Deaths & cause Infant deaths from lack of Intensive Care coverage Also guts Women's healthcare
Turncoat Susie, really getting tired of you tweeting out how much fun you're having with Americans do not have health care you voted against

Thank you to @SenatorCollins for her dedication to help those with the disease of addiction. #TreatAddictionSaveLives #ProtectSUDCare
Good job!
This women is a traitor.
Could care less Senator. You voted against repeal & replace. Will never forget or forgive you.
Congratulations there is a opioid epidemic going on killing thousands of Americans  greedy pharmaceutical companies profiting off Opioid
Addiction has touched my family's life, I'm thankful for a loved one's treatment & recovery. Compassion and treatment are needed. Thank you
#IStandWithRand
Have the Pharmaceutical companies pay for all the treatment centers and treatments for opioids since they created the the opioid epidemic
Collins destroyed Healthcare
Resign
Are you for #MedicareForAll? Now would be a good time to come out for it.
