#DumpRyan
#DitchMitch
Do members of Congress deserve better healthcare plans than working Americans?
Of course not
Please be a hero for many more days! Don't let vulnerable Americans lose healthcare—please vote NO to GraCas! We're counting on you. Please!
Yes! This is the way to go. Bipartisan fixes to the ACA. Don't through the healthcare industry into chaos. #KillTheBill
Just fix ACA and rename it. They won't even know.
...now MILLIONS Of US can't AFFORD it due 2 INSANELY HIGH PREMIUMS/DEDUCTIBLES! How can you ALLOW THAT? It was OBAMA'S REDISTRIBUTION PLAN.
Please vote no on graham/Cassidy. Millions of folks cannot survive without it and cannot adjust to the changes.
Please don't murder me. I am disabled and I depend on #Medicaid to keep me alive. Vote NO on #GrahamCassidyBill
Save the unborn! PP is funded in the healthcare bill. Please vote NO! No blood on your hands!  #UnitedForFreedom
@SenatorCollins I for one do not want Oklahoma to control any part of ACA IN Oklahoma, I see fraud, kickbacks, blackmail, etc.,sure u get me
No on Graham-Cassidy deal.
So much misinformation here.  #GrahamCasiddy Does NOT eliminate pre exist conditions Pls vote YES.  Single payer will kill us.
It will for many because prices will rise and many people will be priced out of coverage.
I wouldn't trust you to create anything respectable or truly supportive of THE PEOPLE. Nor would I trust you to care for a dog house.
Don't let them bribe you.  Do the right thing and stick with the bipartisan plan. Talk to your friend @lisamurkowski too please!
Please vote no on #GrahamCassidy bill
Idiot !
$400million to GOP campaign from Koch brothers on condition ACA is repealed. Don't be a sheep. Be a leader. VOTE NO on GrahamCassidy!
@SenatorCollins Please vote NO on the #GrahamCassidyDeathBill
@SenSusanCollins don't be a @SenDeanHeller stand up for the people...
@SenatorCollins has shown genuine leadership and responsibility about impacts on constituents.They all should be showing such diligence.
Senator Collins, Please for Americans, vote NO for repealing the Affordable Care Act. Your bravery and compassion haven't gone unnoticed.
Please vote "no" on the Graham -Cassidy bill.
Work together with Dems, for something that is actually good for humans in America.
Thank you.
Please follow John McCain's lead & vote NO. Bipartisanship is what is needed to put a proper health bill together. This can't be political.
Please Senator Collins vote http://No.Save  us once again.
Please Senator.....begging you to keep being as true to what is decent as u have been and so not vote yes on the new healthcare bill. Please
Fix Obamacare please do not repeal
Just vote NO on GrahamCassidy!!! Be a hero like McCain!!!
McCain stole the spotlight from you again despite you voting NO yourself.
SenCollins- this is a Test of who you are.  Senator McCain is a hero who shows he cares more about Americans than Koch $$$. VoteNO please
OMG NO. We already DID THIS. It cost more than the exchanges. Premiums were $1,000 mo. Why go backward??
Please don't condemn thousands to death
This #GrahamCassidy does not "repeal & replace" ACA w/ anything that resembles health care. Not the right bill, right reason or right time.
What Makes U an Expert on Insurance , Are u Selling Insurance?
I hope you will be able to continue your bipartisan work, hopefully also with Sens Alexander, Murray, and Nelson, to improve the ACA.
Ms Collins you should resign.Also Planned Parenthood Hood should be defunded it supports genocide.
Ms Collins i'm disappointed in you I though you were not for the ACA.Your part of the problem not the solution like King and Pinge.

"Sorry, we have to cut your Medicaid. There's just not enough money" -- guy flying on a Lear Jet charter to Aspen.
Please vote no on the repeal Obamacare vote we need to keep the American healthy you have a golden health care plan American deserve it too
Senator Collins you're the only person that can save our state from Lindsey Graham,please vote No.
74% of Americans do not support #GrahamCassidy  Please #VoteNo - #GiveBipartisanEffortsAChance.
THANK YOU for continuing to work for bipartisan solutions with heart! Still need to convince others to vote NO on G-C!!
Please retire, your not helping people with high health care cost you need to vote for repeal Oboma care ,plaese don't run for Gov
Thank you for trying to find workable solutions for health care instead of fueling partisan fighting.
You are a beacon of public service and decency in an age when those qualities are, unfortunately, not valued highly enough.

Come on Congress!!  Time to pass Obamacare repeal and replace bill NOW!  Then Tax Cuts!!  No More Excuses!! 
We need you. Please vote NO to the current attempt to pass another horribly bungled healthcare bill. Much easier to refine ACA
So, in order 2 protect ABORTIONS you will vote NO on G-C? U will HURT EVERYONE ELSE 2 PROTECT something that can be funded privately? Sad.
Are you gonna save O'Care after 7 years of promise to repeal & replace? We'll appreciates if you join your party and pass this Bill.
YES, stabilize existing ACA insurance markets! #ACARepair
While your at it vote yes for the Health care bill!  Get Obama out of our lives!  Give the power to the states!
Uhm.... ACA gave power to states to create exchanges, they mostly gave it back to the Feds! Except those who refused Medicaid expansion.
Unbelievable how democracts are coming at you. Why? Because they think your a weak republican. 
Republicans voted you in. 
We are watching
Hopefully you’ll vote yes for this new Health Bill from Graham & repeal Obama Care once an for all  Many Americans suffering.
What if one of your 5 kids gets an illness like cancer or MS and has no future because of medical costs? Do you THINK of that??

USA, wealthiest country in history, is 31st in life expectancy-a travesty. Sen. Collins, please vote NO on Graham-Cassidy tax cut bill.
I know there is a way to make sure everyone gets the healthcare they need. Say no to GrahamCassidy bill
Bolster ACA Exchanges, lower Medicare age limit, expansion of Medicaid to all states & keep employer insurance option = Universal Healthcare
Obamacare is making the middle class the new uninsured.  It is unfixable.  KEEP YOUR PROMISE AND REPEAL IT!
Publicly oppose Trumpcare, and when it finally dies continue the bipartisan push toward improving the ACA.

Now we pay over $2000.00 a yr for NO INSURANCE because premiums & deductibles are CRIMINALLY INSANELY HIGH!! Yet others get subsidies...
My family LOST our docs / insurance. Ocare just REDISTRIBUTED insur frm the middle class to pple with less money. Now WE can't AFFORD IT.
Don't take the bribe of keeping the ACA-millions will suffer in other states! Be our hero AGAIN! Vote NO! #noGrahamCassidy
75% of the CRAP libs are posting here is MADE UP! Stop listening to them. They are getting free or cheap healthcare while WE pay 4 it!
You WILL NEVER GET 100% what u want. Vote for G/C and FIX IT LATER. YOU SWAMP MEMBERS *PROMISED* 4 SEVEN YRS! Are YOU going 2 LIE 2 US NOW??
STOP LISTENING TO THE LIBS WHO LOVE O-CARE! ACA was BUILT ON LIES! I lost my doc of 25 YEARS!! Vote 4 this and FIX IT LATER.
Doctors R already refusing Medicare, even w/supplemental Ins.  Wealthy will use doctors in pvt practice.  We will get Drs w/bad credentials.
Collins votes w/Dems on HC.  She ushers you into Single Payer (free) HC.  UK has free HC.  They wait 10 mos for a biopsy?  Get what U pay 4.
If free HC was good 4 vets. Y did Pres Trump have 2 legislate "accountability".  They will cover all today, then remove or cull costly grups
America has free healthcare for vets.  Pres Trump had 2 rescue them from Gov.  Passed the Accountability & Choice Acts.  You're next!
Has Susan jumped 2 the Dem side?  Will they force free HC on Americans.  HC dictated by same Gov who allowed vets to die waiting 4 service?
3/3 many, 20yrs aftr screening?  Did UK cull population?  UK announced, free HC cost prohibitive.  Will deny HC 2 unhealthy; obese & smokers
2/3 use "free" doctors?  No disease or partner control!  UK also lost 2400 Hemophiliacs 2 AIDS tainted blood.  How does this happen to so
1/3  Single Payer & universal HC, Is free HC.  UK has free HC, they have AIDS epidemic.  Offer AIDS test kits from vending machines?  Y not
States refuse to take responsibility for administration of healthcare?  U have stood in the way of Gop plan that would save us from S/P.
Was that real courage or a bait and switch the last time you voted against repeal of O-care? We need your bravery now to vote against repeal
People before party or party before people.  You decided Sen. Collins.
McConnell/DJT's desire to win at all costs in their repeal/replace's a game 2 them bc they r rich. It isn't a game 2 everyone who'll b hurt.
Vote #NOGrahamCassidy. It's  worse than The last bill. Be a leader. Stand for decency. It's not about your state alone. It's everyone.
Senator please don't rush through an ill-conceived Take 2 of R&R. Time and bipartisanship = good bill 4 American people

Senator Collins,I am encouraged to hear U are working on a bipartisan bill 2 stabilize the ACA. Thank you. Say No 2 #GrahamCassidyDeathBill
