Per NYTimes, you "don't think [Trump's sexism] directly affects legislating healthcare" -- w/ draconian cuts to maternity health coverage!?
Senator Collins President Obama is not in office so stop with the Obama bashing and fix what u think is wrong with OC.
TrumpCare which would deprive 23 million people of health insurance causing Americans to suffer & die just so wealthiest can get a tax cut.
Strengthen ACA, screw Trumpcare.  Why r u trying to fix this shitty bill no one supports and that will hurt millions of US citizens?  Why?
this healthcare bill is an abomination
Please vote no. This will hurt your constituents. Respectfully, please say no.
How can you support abortion?  you know its murder!
Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater, literally because Paul Ryan wants to destroy Pres O's legacy!
Why are you basing your decision on Medicaid? Why not on the middle-class that is getting royally robbed by ObamaCare?
Repeal then replace. Get with the program.
Think you need to explain your thought process in supporting pp, really what your voters want? Corruption rampant in this democratic org
Thank you again senator for opposing this poorly designed and disastrous healthcare bill!
Please maintain your opposition to AHCA. Even if they stop the tax cut it has to be a brand new bill, amendments aren't enough
We are depending on you to VOTE NO! Deals being made now are fig leaves and this non- healthcare bill will still do harm! Vote NO!
Susan, a democrat at heart.
So proud of you as an honest republican Senator who is willing to look out for the people you represent & not be a lemming to the Trump sea
Thank you for sticking up for what's right and sticking to your guns that this bill is WRONG!
Don't do us any favors you liberal! You're not talking about Healthcare except government-run Healthcare!
Thanks for the comprehensive interview, Senator.  Your positions as articulated are vital to Mainers. #representME
Please hold firm in your concern for the American people and vote NO.
I guess it's still a no-go on Planned Parenthood.

Leave our healthcare alone vote no the bill and the president is deeply unpopular he has no public support anymore.
Senator, I was one of the ones tweeting at you last week, so it's only fair I thank you for rejecting the healthcare bill.
You can't Republican Democrats. Media has not given Trump a break. They themselves say insulting things.
VOTE NO ON WEALTHCARE!  We need you to stay strong, with the  people.  Find a bipartisan fix, not tax breaks for the rich!
TV appearances w/ preselected questions/talking points do NOT = in person town hall meetings w/ constituents.  Please respect the voters.
Is it true that your vote can be bought by the addition of $45 million for opioid addiction
please stay focused on the important issues, since the POTUS is way off track.
Respectfully, please vote NO, Senator!
Is someone going to primary this dip?  My God...she is barely intelligible.
I think you will be asked to justify this.
CA voter here, insured through #MedicaidExtension, w/ two sons w/ #preexistingconditions. Hoping you'll do the right thing, and #SaveOurCare

Senator the American people have faith in you that you will not cave to this terrible heartless bill
Susan why can't the republicans put together a bill that would pass? It's your job!

Seriously, I'm sure she is looking out for all of her constituents.
She is too stupid to look out for anyone.
You know you are 20 trillion in debt
Never forget how important Planned Parenthood is to women and teens.   De-funding it is a slap in the face and a death sentence for many.
You pay
