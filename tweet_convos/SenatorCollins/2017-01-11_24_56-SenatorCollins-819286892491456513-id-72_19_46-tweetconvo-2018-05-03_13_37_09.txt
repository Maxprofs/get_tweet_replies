Voters are sending you home at your next election. Why should the US be the only major country without healthcare for all
Help us keep the affordable care act.
I used to respect you. Shame on you. #making America sick again
Will you vote for a replacement if preexisting coverage is eliminated? That is what @RandPaul is advocating.
Why isn't it replace and repeal? You've had 8 yrs to make a plan but all you did was complain. Where's the plan?
ACA saved my husband's life and prevented bankruptcy. Please do not repeal this lifeline.  I beg you.
Seems some Mainers are more equal to others when it comes to health care. Thanks, not. #ObamaCare #ACA #MakeAmericaSickAgain
Recycled @GOP ideas aren't good replacements 4 #ACA NO to:highRiskInsPools,InsAcrossStateLines,HCSA
YOU ARE FANTASTIC AT THE HEARING MY FRIEND!! @realDonaldTrump #GodBlessYou and America 
Please insure that Mainers have  health care. The ACA working well for us and our kids. Improve - NO REPEAL
you seem like  a dear sweet lady , a shameless brown noser , but a sweet one
horrible. Just horrible you just murdered many even children
way to go, Susan, voting against keeping health care for millions. I used to like you. Very disappointed.
I am a Veteran and a Educator.  I do not support Betsy Devos as our Sec. of Education.
huge contradiction. You voted to repeal #ACA but say you're for rural health care. You owe Mainers an explanation.
got to see how corrupt u r today u r wench Gop
U care about health care for Maine? U vote to ABOLISH ACA...Shameful hypocrte.
Susan Collins back stabbed Planned Parenthood
Can't believe I ever voted for you. You had this Independent fooled. #Neveragain #traitor to Americans #Shameonyou
@SenatorCollins
To all those #EVIL  #Republicans who voted to repeal #ObamaCare #ACA , WATCH YOUR STEP!!   

#ACARepeal #FridayThe13th #MidtermElections 
u r so wrong on health care if we lose ours u lose urs
We pay 4 ur Gold Standard health ins. You repay by stealing health care from my wife and daughter. SHAMEFUL #healthcare #aca
you aren't getting my vote next term.
Senator Collins, I expected more.
I thought you were against repealing #ACA before a replacement plan was agreed upon? That was a VERY costly vote for you.
Hope ur not gonna allow Repub leadership to throw hardworking Americans off #ACA w/o a gd replacemnt. Many who need it!
Will #Trumpcare cover PreExistingCondit?Students26y?PreventiveCare?NOLifeTimeLimit?CapOnOutOfPocket?
Your fired! In terms you understand
How can you permit millions to be denied adequate health insurance. Thousands will die. Stand up to this outrage
we appreciate your wisdom in slowing repeal until there is a solid plan. Millions need healthcare..Medicaid not enough
I'm glad he understands rural healthcare because you neither know nor care about it and will be out of office soon
Shameful Senator chooses party over American people. Disgusting and heartless.
@SenAngusKing If you plan to take away our #ACA, can you live with the guilt of killing Mainers?
Don't take away our #ACA if you intend to keep your awesome health care.
I dare you to live without the BEST healthcare that WE THE PEOPLE provide for you. @SenAngusKing
How dare you take away health care from Mainers when you enjoy the BEST OF THE BEST healthcare for life. Selfish
Our health is not a pawn in the RNC goal to provide tax breaks for the billionaires.
you just hurt rural health care.  You should be ashamed of yourself!
Sorry, Senator Collins, when you voted to repeal #ACA, you lost all credibility on healthcare. #BloodOnYourHands #SaveACA
If you kick millions of people of their healthcare including me. The people will vote you out.
Understand healthcare enough to take it away from millions. Shame on you for voting to kill people and bankrupt them.
Deeply disappointed in your vote last night rushing to repeal ACA without a viable replacement. Shame on u. Thought u cared
Given U want healthcare for others, I look forward to UR keeping Mainers healthy by voting against repeal of #ACA #ObamaCare

great! Now, you protect the rest of us. Save #ACA protect  #Medicare , protect those on #Medicaid  Help us,#Senator
But last night you voted to reject amendment that would protect funding for rural hospitals. Pls explain.
Do republicans take pleasure from ripping healthcare away from the  poor and sick? Don't you people have a  conscious?
and then voted to take away Veterans health care since most get it from the ACA #TAXCUTSFORTHERICH And at 1:30 AM!!! #WTF
GOP wants to bitch and ditch #ACA . 8 years of whining with no replacement plan, disgraceful waste of $. SAD!
Maine needs #ACA. Do not vote repeal #ACA, it saves lives. Trump has proven to be a Putin stooge. He doesn't care for Maine.
why did you gut benefits for veterans and rural hospitals?
SHAME!
I guess living in Maine means you don't care about racism and racists, which is why you could support a bigot for AG.
- Did You Notice That He Won't Even Look At You?
Most Honorable Senator from Maine, ask him if he is familiar with the "KETO" diet that reverses Diabetes and Heart trouble
