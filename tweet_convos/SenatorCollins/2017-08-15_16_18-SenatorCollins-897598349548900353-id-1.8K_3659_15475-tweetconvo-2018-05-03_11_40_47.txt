Then please help remove this unfit president
But before that, formally leave @GOP . Nothing else will do.
It's time to switch parties @SenatorCollins 
They've left you with no choice
The time is now!
If there's 1 thing that can help slam brakes on @realDonaldTrump train wreck its losing a senator in protest & thus further power 2 inflame
And bring @lisamurkowski  with you
Yes, the nutty Left can have those two spineless Feminists.
Plural-groups. You therefore agree with @POTUS timely and original statement.
Antifa just declared a terror group. Time to denounce them!
@SenatorCollins - you all enabled him for months.  Is this enough now or are you waiting for more?
Lovely remarks, Senator. Do you have the courage to back up these words and call for @potus to #resign right now?
Senator @SenatorCollins make the right choice, he is unfit to lead.
Thanks Obama! I'm exDemocrat2015 because his divisive ways became SO obvious. Y'all can't win in a UNITED USA.
You must IMPEACH this shell of a human.  No one else in your party has the gumption. #ImpeachTrumpNow
You didn't mention the group names specifically....why was your response  better than #POTUS ?
I suppose u blamed that on our President. I hope I loose ur job this next election because u sure r not helping to maga. U r a obstructer
Thank U again 4 setting yourself apart from d silence w/in d Rparty. My heart breaks 2 C a party that once stood 4 d ppl now stomp on d ppl
Isn't that exactly what Trump has said? Yet you fight against him instead of standing with him. Disgusting!
Time to address the real problem. #ImpeachTrump
NO, it was caused by Left Wing ANTIFA & BLM who were vicious. Police stood down after herding the permit holding protestors into them! LIE.
please remove trump, he has lost his mind
Please unite members of your party to take action against this unfit, unstable man.
Most Americans don't give a shit about Charlottesville, how about OBAMACARE Repeal and tax reform? 39.5 % increase for 2018 get to work!!
Please call upon @realDonaldTrump to resign - I do not say this lightly
Sorry Mr. President.
"Good people" don't march with Nazis.
They fight them.
#ImpeachTrump
We the people are vote your ass out of office
25TH AMENDMENT NOW!
Yes ALL hate groups. We shouldn't pick and chose which ones to unite against.
Does it also include uniting against the Republican President who has emboldened these scumbag racists?
You MUST be supporting KKK and White Supremacists! You didn't specifically condemn them, so now they are thanking you for supporting them.
actions, not words, Senator. #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachOrResign
Please take a stand!
Please do all you can to remove Trump. Country too wounded to continue w/ him.
@SenatorCollins what do you  intend to do about the hate coming from the Whitehouse? Fish is rotting from the head #25thAmendmentNow
I think it's time for you to give up being a senator if you can't support the agenda r of your own party. !!
And to do so we must first unite against our president, who so lovingly embraces them. #ImpeachNow
The violence was encouraged by Politicians who divided then ensured Police were not allowed to keep the peace. Pols like you are the problem

73% Say Freedom of Speech Worth Dying For - Rasmussen Reports™ http://m.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/lifestyle/general_lifestyle/august_2017/73_say_freedom_of_speech_worth_dying_for …
They were all hate groups just like Trump said. We're seeing hate from the Dems, Antifa, BLM, Muslim Brotherhood & more. They're intolerant
President Trump is not going to be impeached .President Trump will be here for another 7 1/2 years so get over it snowflakes
And DEFENDED by @realDonaldTrump. You and your party have the power to rid us of this human pestilence. What are you waiting for?
It was caused when a group had a rally violently interrupted by Antifa, police were told to stand down stop the race baiting.
Remove Trump is your only play left.
the "racist hate groups" are the Alt-Left party started out as KKK under Democrats and now the Antifa is the new Alt-Left Hate group of Dems
Thank you, Senator. But it is the time that you denounce the President by name. He is destroying the republic.
IMPEACH TRUMP! He is not fit for the White House!
Tag him.

I agree, the hate and violence on both sides in Charlottesville is shared by all sides and the Pres had it right.
My dad was an officer in the military yet their is no respect, gen neller blocked me instead of contacting me to ask how he could help.
Let's hate the haters, then they'll hate you back, then you'll hate them more and more, and so on...
I think she has taken a stand. Go after the other 49.
Words are nice but it's far too late. Articles of impeachment need to be drawn. Will take a few brave Republicans to do it. Demos on board!
Agree but why aren't you showing courage by calling out trump as a supporter of these terrorists
Get rid of the sick man in our WH!
Why didn't you mention Trump's name?
Tepid rhetoric is better than nothing, I suppose, but not much. Put your money where your mealy mouth is.
Not good enough Senator. Call him out by name.
YOU WORK WITH THEM THE DEMOCRATS U KISS UP TOO
Try adding @realDonaldTrump to your tweets. They might come off as more than whispering into a typhoon that way.
Apparently the president doesn't think so
Agreed.  That means Antifa and Black Lives Matter as well as the Nazis and White Supremacists, right?
True. But you must B willing to name both groups. U name one & not the other. AntiFa is dangerous because it's sponsored by big Soros money
You forgot to add the Antfia & BLM!! Sorry they don't get a pass!!
You must impeach Donald Trump now.
Time to reject all who hate.
Why don't you unite behind your Senate colleagues and repeal ACA...?  Ain't gonna happen with you in the Senate... VOTE HER OUT!
You mean Antifa Alt-Lft Nazi Socialist DINO Party  ?
It was caused by hate groups on BOTH sides colliding.  You are a national embarrassment for undermining the President.  Resign!!
On all sides… Right?!
It was caused by #ANTIFA.. When can we expect You to denounce them?
U r 1 of very few ppl in Congress that can truly bring @realDonaldTrump nightmare 2 grinding halt:by formally leaving @GOP Desperate times..
Please call out Trump as an enabler. You know he is.
Kat I bet you never seen this video about this racist party. It's true in the history book share it with ur friends
Please take action Senator.

Aug 21-Drop @realDonaldTrump from Twitter/Facebook Monday 8/31. In 1 fell swoop, hit him in the only place he cares about! #DumpTrumpMonday! 
Tell the leader of your party. Do you need his Twitter handle?
Yes antifa is definitely a hate group as is blm
Unite and do something. Congress must clean out the WH of these white supremacist suppprters.
We cherish you and your HEALTH, Susan!
Why are you afraid to name @realDonaldTrump in this denunciation?
They don't have a legitimate venue w/o the excuse of statue removal - let's ignore the statues for a bit; they will have to find another way
@jaketapper And as I asked @SpeakerRyan what are you going to do? Surely you witnessed the lunacy on display this afternoon
Please work with your house colleagues to #ImpeachTrump
Get all the info b4 making tweets; local reporter there witnessing peaceful protest by proper licensed attendees and were attacked by antifa
Never Collins again !
call Trump out by NAME. He doesn't belong in office. Yesterday can't happen again.
very pathetic response, why not denounce Trump?
No mention of Trump because, you know, party loyalty. 

#SickOfrepublicanBullshit
appreciate your words, now it is time to step up and ACT,get the GOP together and ACT, stop the mad man in the WH #traitor #ImpeachTrump NOW
That's great Senator. Denounce @realDonaldTrump  for being a hate mongering Nazi lover
He's, antifa is a hate group
I respect you @SenatorCollins and am proud you represent ME. It is time, however, to denounce the President by name.
Thanks Susan.
This is not enough. You must denounce @realDonaldTrump and call on your GOP colleagues to do the same. Now is the moment Senator.
Senator, are you willing to take action & impeach him before the country is deformed beyond recognition??
Time for Trump to go. Get rid of him. He needs to resign..or be impeached
And McMoRo and Reichert.
You have done commendable work but Trump? Go the extra mile!
One of them is the President of the United States. Unite YOUR party, Senator Collins, to remove this filth from office.
Still waiting for Obama to disavow BLM,Black Panther Party for all the Violence, Hate and race rhetoric. Hold antifa responsible as well.
On the left and the right?
You said that already...when r u going to do something about that menace in the WH? That is your job...history will not be kind if u dont
its your #GOP party. What are you going to do? Your #POTUS is goose stepping with his base. SHAME. Will you denounce him? #OUTRAGED american
Sen. Collins you must denounce Donald Trump otherwise you are only enabling him! #ImpeachTrump
Time to censure the president. We're counting on you. #censuretrump
Then denounce @realDonaldTrump
Who is paying you to spew these lies?
Thank you for your leadership Senator @SenatorCollins
He is unfit for office. Time for Repubs to Put America First and remove him from office.
Please do the right thing one more time Senator #ImpeachTrump @realDonaldTrump before our country is destroyed
Does that include ANTIFA?
Thank you!  Please call for a bi-partisan Senate resolution specifically condemning Neo-Nazi and white supremacist hate groups.
Thank You, Senator Collins, for speaking out against this insanity.
Say his name
AND DJT CAME UP WITH THE PLAN, Trump is trying to change news topics from his swaying the stock market 4 profit and Russia Collusion!
Please unite against this unfit "President." Also Steve Bannon and Miller need to be removed from the WH immediately.
Lady you wouldn't come out from behind your desk to stop anything
ON BOTH SIDES
@GOP must call perpetrator by name PRESIDENT TRUMP. He stands w/these people 2 hold on 2 his base. THIS IS HIS BASE!! Say his name chickens.
Stupid white people went to a constitutionally protected rally.  Stupid left wing fascist went to start a fight.
If you truly believe this, then it's time for you to address @realDonaldTrump directly.
Weak
Well say its name - Donald J Trump. I thought you had much bigger gonads than that useless tweet you just posted.
And against Trump...
Plz do not leave the @GOP - invoke 25th amendment & take back the party of Lincoln. Save the party / save the republic Do the right thing!!
The hate is starting at the top. Impeach him!
Remember Anti-fa and #BLM were responsible for much of the violence
You need to call for Trump's resignation, Senator Milquetoast.
Thanks for your deep thoughts on this matter. What's your thoughts on Healthcare
Thank you for being clear @SenatorCollins please stand against the ambiguity of @POTUS and defend this country!
Senator, so many of us appreciate your stances against POTUS on key issues. NOW is the time to call him out and disavow. All else is empty.
Is Trump fit to be President @SenatorCollins ?
The President refused to call the driver a terrorist today because he was white.  You are continuing to support a dangerous man.
#Impeach #LiarInChief
Trump will never stand up to them. he only empowers them. We need to remove him from office.
Yah, thanks for that but it's pretty obvious. The real question is how are we going to unite to remove Trump from office?
Articles of impeachment, post haste!
And you must get to work in the Senate blocking the fruit of his racism, his agenda. Stand up. #TrumpSwamp #Unfitforthepresidency #resist
Stop playing with this nut in the #Whitehouse remove him. 
Senate & Congressional Members better start worrying about their spot in history
Most importantly, the Congress *must* rid our Nation of the @realDonaldTrump IMMEDIATELY! #25thAmendmentNow
We need more than words. We need our reps to REMOVE any government official who doesn't denounce this hate.
You forgot to add 'that the President has enabled, emboldened, and encouraged' in there. Do something about this, Senator. Please.
Thank you. But most people already know this. It's the President who needs convincing, and that's what we need you to act on.
Call him out by name, Senator - say the name of the racist who has stolen our country!
You must #ImpeachTrump and get rid of all the racist in the WH.
Insufficient. Denounce President Trump for condoning Nazis or be counted as a supporter. Choose a side.
What about the alt-right in the WH?  This is weak
Then call out the leader of your party!  @realDonaldTrump supports it, so do you until you take action!
Trump won't listen to Hillary, Barak, Chuck, or Nancy
Yup but please disavow vigilante groups. We will turn into the Wild West otherwise.
As our elected officials,YOU MUST CALL OUT THE @POTUS FOR BEING RACIST.Impeachment must happen. He cannot be racist and represent ALL PEOPLE
Trump, Pelosi, Schumer, Ryan, and McConnell need to make a shoulder to shoulder appearance and reject alt right and alt left
Senator Collins, it is time to demand that @POTUS resign the Presidency. He is unfit to lead.
Senator, you may wish to consider whether you want to be a part of this party anymore.  I mean that with all respect.
Save your political soul & simply call Trump a racist. Because he's a racist. Please think about your legacy. 'Cus your party won't.
We need action. Demand impeachment!
BLM being one of them.
Yes and also pray that they will come to know Jesus as Lord and be filled with the love of God.
Impeach trump
Condemn and disavow this man
Then switch parties or declare yourself an independent. Staying with the @GOP that encouraged this disaster is indefensible.
We must call on this president to resign immediately. The @GOP needs to do that. You Senator need to do that. Words are not enough.
Try again! This won't do it.
@SenateMajLdr @SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC @lisamurkowski 
When we eventually slide into a civil war, remember failure to stop birtherism
#ImpeachTrump
Start by calling out & condemning their chief: Donald Trump
Be more specific. White supremacists, KKK, alt right
Thank you. We cannot have a white supremacist sympathizer in the WH. Please call for 45 to #resign or face #impeachment or #25thamendment.
Not nearly enough, Sen Collins, it's time once again, for you to use the same resolve as you did with healthcare. Thank you
Senator Collins you're absolutely right the violence in Charlottesville was caused by neo-nazis and antifa they're all hate groups
It all starts at the top

Please explain #McCain #Ukraine #Svoboda 
We know this already. This is worthless. What do we do about the racist who heads your party. Condemn BY NAME or QUIT
Here's a novel idea why don't U get behind R Pres in his agendas that include fighting violence across t board? 2 busy lining your pockets?
So, senator, stand up to your party and your president.
Explain how we unite when the republicans don't call him out by name....
What can we do to remove Trump? He's going to ignite a civil war....
if we unite against them, the POTUS will get very angry that we are siding against his base of support.  IT IS CLEAR HE LOVES THE KKK!!!!
Thank you for all that you have done thus far to protect us from this "president", please continue to fight!
I will agree it was Hate groups all not just a 1 sided hate group unite against all of them
Start with the Nazi's in the White House, @realDonaldTrump first and foremost.
#25thAmendment #25thAmendment
There's a racist currently occupying the White House. How do you plan to unite against him? Until you call for impeachment this is hot air
POTUS is one one them. Unite w your colleagues against him. Tweets are nice, actions better. I believe in your strength.
