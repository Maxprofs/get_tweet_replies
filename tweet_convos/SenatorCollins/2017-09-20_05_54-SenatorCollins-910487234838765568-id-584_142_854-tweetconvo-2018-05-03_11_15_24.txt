I am a mother with lupus. PLEASE do not let the GOP kill me with #GrahamCassidyDeathBill
Really Sarah Smith. You really blame GOP for Obama failures? Can you afford premiums of ACA? Deductions? Co-pays? Neither can anyone else!!
Yes, I can and yes the GOP has sabotaged ACA, causing increasing premiums. And #GrahamCassidy will cause 32M to lose insurance
Sarah. Don’t you know that taking almost a trillion bucks from healthcare will make it better? You’ll have more ACCESS. #GrahamCassidy

There are 2 things you can do for elderly. A law calling for evac. of nursing homes when storm approaches, & a NO vote on Cass/Graham bill
You must vote yes or socialize medicine for ever. You are a true American. Changes can be made later. Please, do the right thing!
How about affordable health care for aging Americans. Please, do not let the GOP harm Americans. Vote no. You can do better.
The #GrahamCassidy bill would remove essential benefits and increase premiums.

Ppl would go bankrupt over medical bills.

Please vote no.
