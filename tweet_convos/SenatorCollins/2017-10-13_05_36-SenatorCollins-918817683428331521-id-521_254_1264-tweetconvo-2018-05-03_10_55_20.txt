You are a coalition-builder and we need you in the Senate now more than ever. Thank you for your commitment. So grateful you are staying.
Thank you Sen. Collins for remaining in the Senate. We need you!
Right Sen Collins The reason you are not running is you cannot get elected!The Obama subsides are illegal!Subsides comes from taxpayers!MAGA
Another phony progressive Repub
Another question: How much do you worry about Donald Trump’s mental health?
Lol...  wondering about the mental stability of the top 8 democrat liberals...   add Collins to that liberal list
Yes thank you now you can really screw this country are u kidding me just resign u no morals lying politician!#MAGA
Thank you! @SenatorCollins for your decision to remain in Senate. The people, more than ever, need you there! God bless you!
Senator, we r not tired of bannons words, we r tired of ur inaction, never Trump attitude w/grouchy mcCain, graham, corker & failed promises
I'm hanging on every word.
Please run for governor, please please please
Why are people in Maine so intent on being lead around by a little old lady?She said she isn’t going anywhere?Voters don’t get any say so?
Of course as governor she can only hurt population of her state but as senator she can screw the whole country like she’s been doing
In her speech Collins denounced latest move by @realDonaldTrump to undermine Obamacare subsidies.
As any liberal would....  ur point?
She's not a liberal though.
This pay-for-play has to stop
You wouldn't sign because you wanted deals for your state well as far as I'm concerned that's wrong it shouldn't just be for your state
Damn.
Dear Senator Collins, even though I am not from Maine, I love your decision to stay in the Senate. You are doing a great job there, love it
We need you out of Senate ASAP.
Resign you are a RINO obstructionist
Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! 
Thank you for your service. I don't always agree, but I always respect your thoughtful, balanced leadership.
Thank you for deciding to remain in the Senate...the nation needs your level head and courage to put the country before party!
Do Republicans a favor.....switch parties to make sense of your Senate votes. You are a traitor
Glad you are staying in DC - Maine and country need your moderate & "doing right" voice against this divisive & dangerous administration.
I hope and pray Bannon comes after you when you run again say bye bye to the senate #MAGA
Part of the swamp that needs to be drained n why be republican since she sides with democrats like McCain ?! Time to oust this liar

Stating ur a republican while halting progress towards assisting the people isn't an achievement. Padding that pension?
Thank you for continuing to serve where you have the most influence.
She is hiding in Senate hoping we will forget her horrendous flip flop on ACA.  We won't
keep fighting the good fight Senator.  How does President Collins sound??

You are not supporting the agenda America voted for. Resign now! You sold yourself and betrayed your voters. Shameful!
You're an impostor
Wow look at all the Dems congratulating you.  Will make is easy to remember who to vote out in the future.
It should be for all Americans 25 million are off it paying penaltys 9 million don't have it high premiums and high deductibles can't use it
Oh please you're not doing what the voters want you're doing what the Democrats want Obamacare is hurting millions millions of Americans
How was "Don't Ask Don't Tell" discriminatory? Same for all. Was set in place to avoid discrimination.
Many thanks for ALL your continued hard work and for representing me!
Thank you Senator! This country needs you. Yours truly, a voter from Pennsylvania.
Thank you so much for remaining in the Senate. You are an amazing, strong woman with sincere love for America and its citizens.

TY, Senator. We are grateful for your voice of reason speaking for us.
Thank u Senator! U r the kind of Senator we need in Congress. I am a Democrat who really wants to see a bipartisan Congress. U give me hope!
The no voting and untruthful senator who only divides and steals from the senate, takes a salary and no work, how does that work? just sayn
Thank you @SenatorCollins, the Senate needs more thoughtful, measured and principled leadership like you!

She should’ve run for that. She’s not going to be re elected to Congress.
I'm sure you'd make a fine governor but, as the only #GOP senator with integrity, the nation needs you in congress.
Senator, thank you for staying in the Senate.  We need rational people like you in the senate.
Thank you so much Senator @SenatorCollins
Why can’t she vote with her party?
Thank you, Senator. We need your rational voice on the national level in these perilous times.
Thank you for protecting our country
From PA — a Big thank you!!!

I am not a republican but I believe in what you stand for. Good, common sense and humanitarian values. Be kind, be a Mainer
Thank God, a person with integrity and brains. Grateful for your decision. Thank you.
Thank you for your courage to represent the people.
Not a Republican. Not from Maine. Still, much thanks for staying in Senate. Need a voice of reason in dangerous times.
Senator Collins: Thank you for making the hard choice to continue your work in the Senate, where your courage and conscience give us hope.

Thank you so much Senator Collins for deciding to stay in the Senate. You are one of the few honest Republicans left in the Senate.
I am very disillusioned with the GOP. They don't seem to care about Americans, but YOU DO. All they seem to care is their agenda & ...
care about is their agenda & fulfilling their campaign promises whether they R actually good 4 their constituents or not. We live in ...
troubling times with a President that does represent the ideals of our founding fathers or Constitution.  Thank you for standing up ...
against this oppressive leader. We are better bc of you. Thank u for representing not only Maine, but the rest of the United States.
Wonderful to know you can have work in several places, and can choose. I hope and believe you will work for those who have fewer choices.
Keep up the good fight, Senator Collins!

We have insurance as ret. military however, our adult educated #WorkingPoor use #ACA and it works! They have preexisting med. conditions...
I’m a democrat, but glad to see you sticking around. Nothing wrong with an enlightened republican. If only there were about 50 more like you

Turncoat Susan: this was a great decision not to run for governor. The odds of you winning were about 12% they want to Republican not a dem
Thank you for sticking with it. We need folks like you in Congress.o few have a oral compass anymore
While you would have made a great governor I'm very happy you will stay in the Senate. USA needs you!
God bless you 4 your decision! If U left, you'd be replaced w/ someone very corrupt, & we already have too many political thugs! Thank you!
