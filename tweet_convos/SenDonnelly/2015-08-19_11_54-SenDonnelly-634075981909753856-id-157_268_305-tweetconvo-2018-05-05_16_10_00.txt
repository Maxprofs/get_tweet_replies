@SenDonnelly thanks for give Iran a nuke! We will remember you in 2018!
@SenDonnelly Despite having ?'s of their intentions U r still going to vote for this? Chanting "death to America " isn't  a big enough clue?
@SenDonnelly How many of these secret side deals are we not aware of? How can you support this horrible deal?
@SenDonnelly you have let our country down! If you read this "Deal" you would not in good conscience agree to vote for such a pitiful farce!
@SenDonnelly @WhiteHouse
@SenDonnelly We the people SAY NO to AIDING OUR ENEMY JOE DONNELLY...
@SenDonnelly thanks for standing up with democracy #IranDeal
@aram_shahinfard  ...or laying down for the president 
@SenDonnelly
So 3 or 4 years from now when Iran tests their bomb... you'll do what? 
Say oops?
Or blame it on the Right?
#SecurityFirst

@SenDonnelly @WhiteHouse thank you!
@SenDonnelly https://twitter.com/cerenomri/status/634427949329084417 …
@SenDonnelly So then you are willing to trust Iran's own inspectors to reveal any indiscretion on Iran's part? Got it. #NoIranDeal
@SenDonnelly thank you senator. You are doing the right thing despite what all these idiots are saying about the #IranDeal
@SenDonnelly @WhiteHouse @IntlCrimCourt

Who's gonna stop this enraged cihadi-fascist; named: Erdogan ?!
@MumtazCeltik @SenDonnelly @WhiteHouse @IntlCrimCourt Erdogan is a problem that US is beginning to realize. But M.E. is a mess right now.
@SenDonnelly the Hoosiers I know are with you Joe on your support of the treaty with Iran!
@SenDonnelly Disgusted you are support the Iran Deal! Cowardly & short sighted! As Indy resident-shocked at your corrupted lack of vision.,
Very ashamed of @SenDonnelly my Senator. Can not believe you are following your leader and not the will of Indiana voters that elected you!
@SenDonnelly senator ...supporting even after the self inspection revealed ?  It's ok to back@away from this.  You represent Hoosiers...
@SenDonnelly 
We here in Southern Indiana do not sign contracts that we are not ALLOWED to see.
Can't wait to vote you out.
@SenDonnelly PLEASE VOTE NO TO BAD IRAN DEAL! !!!!!!!!
@SenDonnelly Thank you, Senator! Glad I voted for you!
@SenDonnelly:First you were against the Iran deal & now you are voting for it Thought you had some integrity by not voting along party lines
@SenDonnelly is a fool! This agreement gives Iran the right to use its own inspectors! Anyone who supports this loses my support!
@SenDonnelly

@SenDonnelly @WhiteHouse - sad
@SenDonnelly Thank you!
@SenDonnelly This Iran deal is an act of Treason against America..We the People do not want this deal!!!!!!!!
@SenDonnelly How much did you get for selling out our country?

@SenDonnelly Thank you, Senator, for supporting the #IranDeal and giving the diplomatic solution a chance to succeed.
@SenDonnelly B4 U vote, talk to @SenatorMenendez He knows everything about this 'deal.'
@SenDonnelly Sir, you have just made the biggest mistake of your life.
@SenDonnelly Original idea was to really stop Iran from producing nuclear bomb totally. When did it change to postponement???
@SenDonnelly So, U think OK that Iran inspect its sites?? http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/content/un-allow-iran-inspect-own-nuclear-work-site … 10-15 yrs not long; yr grandkids will deal w/nuke Iran
@SenDonnelly linh
Selling out America & Israel ==> RT “@SenDonnelly: Joe announced he will support the proposed Iran Nuclear Agreement. #IranDeal”
@ProgsToday @SenDonnelly Well then, Joe is a moron. Nice job Joe.
@SenDonnelly you just backed a deal that allows Iran to self inspect one of their major nuclear sites. What are you thinking?
@SenDonnelly thank you Senator! @ChrisMurphyCT
@SenDonnelly Thank you Senator for supporting #IranDeal! Still lawmakers w/ integrity in the #Senate

#DiplomacyOverDonors
@SenDonnelly:Joe announced he ll support t proposed Iran Nuclear Agmnt.#IranDeal http://1.usa.gov/1JiEgTf   v @WhiteHouse
@SenDonnelly @AttyAbdul Z Like a lemming to the sea.  Too bad.
@SenDonnelly @moontartan Wow! What a wonderful surprise. Pundits kept telling us Donnelly was going to be a no on #IranDeal. Thank you Sir
@SenDonnelly @moontartan. Thank You @SenatorJoeDonnelly. #IranDeal. #PeaceNotWar
@SenDonnelly All while Iranian leadership screams #DeathToAmerica at the top of their lungs. If this weren't so stupid, it'd be funny!
@SenDonnelly @WhiteHouse thank you for supporting the Iran deal
@SenDonnelly @AttyAbdul #Dumb Was this decision made BEFORE or AFTER the leak of the secret deal...?
@SenDonnelly @terri_georgia - great, reasoned decision.
@SenDonnelly you cannot be voted out of office soon enough. I also like all of the support from out of state that you received
@SenDonnelly Thank you for supporting this deal and representing the Hoosier State!
@SenDonnelly hope @SenCoonsOffice chooses diplomacy and the POTUS too.
Well said. RT @SenDonnelly: Joe announced he will support the proposed Iran Nuclear Agreement. http://1.usa.gov/1JiEgTf 
@SenDonnelly @AttyAbdul another politician that don't care about this country. Shocking
@SenDonnelly I am an Indiana resident. I don't support this deal. Most Hoosiers don't support this deal. Represent the majority of the state
@SenDonnelly Once again you have made a decision based on a total lack of understanding of the world. do you know about terror
@SenDonnelly @ChrisMurphyCT don't sign a DC lease past 2018, buster
@SenDonnelly @justfp thank you sir for standing up for diplomacy first..not war
@SenDonnelly thank you for supporting all efforts to avoid another war!
@Kelebration @SenDonnelly Why does opposing the deal mean the only other option is war?  Am I missing something?
@SenDonnelly sounds like a crappy dealhttps://twitter.com/sailfishmd/status/634134700446076928
@SenDonnelly time for you to be replaced too. I love how you don't listen to your constituents. Typical politician. Only in it for himself.
@SenDonnelly VOTE DONNELLY OUT OF OFFICE! We need to start now to get rid of him. Watch for the movement to get him out!
@SenDonnelly Good move, Senator. Your earlier statements during this process had me worried.
@SenDonnelly Very well said! Please help your fellow Senators see the common sense of voting for the agreement!
@SenDonnelly What an awful decision. You're going to let Iran police itself? And let corp. off the hook if there are sanction snap backs?
@SenDonnelly politics before country.  Pathetic excuse for a man.
@SenDonnelly  Thank-you Senator Donnelly.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS the must have some good dirt on @SenDonnelly cause NOBODY in their right mind would support this one-sided crooked deal.
@SenDonnelly Thank you so much, Senator. Your explanation for support is eloquent, fact-based and responsible.
@SenDonnelly @TheIranDeal thank you SenDonnelly!
@SenDonnelly @INDems Very happy to see this. Thank you, Senator.
@SenDonnelly @TheIranDeal Which part of the 24 day inspection restriction do you like the most? Giving $150 Billion to terrorists seems bad
@SenDonnelly Strength lies in numbers! Your decision will be rewarded, Senator. Only chickenhawks vote for others to fight unnecessary wars.
@SenDonnelly @johnzody Good news. Thanks.
@SenDonnelly Iran makes us look like fools! We giv them EVRYTHNG wyl getting NOTHNG! We failed, miserably at the table! Did u READ ths deal?
@SenDonnelly How am I supposed to beat back the moderates and take back power for the Iranian hard-liners if the U.S. accepts this deal?
@SenDonnelly http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/08/19/ap-exclusive-un-iran-deal-will-let-tehran-inspect-site-where-it-allegedly/?intcmp=hplnws … A traitor giving comfort to our enemies
@SenDonnelly 
It's disgusting, this #BadDeal ! 100+billion$ to TERROR, no inspections, we pledge 2 help AGAINST sabotage by our allies?
@SenDonnelly @WhiteHouse
@SenDonnelly Give them billions and trust them with self monitoring nuke program. Treasonous!
@SenDonnelly 
It's quite appalling 2 see a pic of u w/military officers while at the same time going along w/this deficient #BadDeal !!!
@SenDonnelly @WhiteHouse 読みづらいわ生保の約款かちゅ〜ん前も書いたやん
Thank you @SenDonnelly for supporting diplomacy and #Irandeal. #NoWarWithIran http://1.usa.gov/1JiEgTf 
@SenDonnelly Thank U for giving diplomacy a chance.
@SenDonnelly you're a fool!! Have you not talked to your constituency?  Apparently not.
@SenDonnelly sad day Donnelly is giving cash and nukes to Iran with this deal. Poor representative for Indiana.
@SenDonnelly what percent of Hoosiers support your position? Over 65% of Hoosiers OPPOSE the Irandeal.
@SenDonnelly really? Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb. Keep that seat warm, we'll Remember this Joe.
@SenDonnelly good that you support this. Am already seeing ads using scare tactics to influence the uninformed.
@sendonnelly thank you  for standing up for Iran nuke deal.
@SenDonnelly Hezbollah thanks you
@SenDonnelly @WhiteHouse Thanks . rest assured about iran! We will never pose a threat toward the US despite the rhetorics.
It's time @CoryBooker, @RonWyden, @PattyMurray, & all @SenateDems joined @SenatorReid in FILIBUSTERING the @GOP #MarchToWar
h/t @SenDonnelly
@SenDonnelly You sound real sure of yourself with all the caveats.  But by 2026, you'll be gone, so it will be someone else's problem.
@SenDonnelly @WhiteHouse #yea...not willing to be bullied 
@SenDonnelly thank you!
@sendonnelly @theirandeal Best way to help US, Europe, and allies in the region is to stop the deal and keep their $150B arms budget frozen
@SenDonnelly SMART!!!  LOOK @globalzero @GlblCtzn @NatGat2014 @InterOcc @99rise @cityattorneyla #GlobalPoliceStateStanddown sooner
@SenDonnelly @WhiteHouse

.@SenDonnelly Thank you for making the right call and supporting the #IranDeal.
@globalzero @SenDonnelly right on!
@SenDonnelly @WhiteHouse Another delusional Democrat
@SenDonnelly @WhiteHouse what's not to like for Iran, they can monitor their own sites. Did you by any chance check with your constituents.
@SenDonnelly @WhiteHouse thank you for your wisdom!
@SenDonnelly Way to go!  Glad you support peace which makes sense given your focus on veterans.
So, you're not running for re-election in 2018? @SenDonnelly
@SenDonnelly @WhiteHouse AP: UN to let Iran inspect alleged nuke work site.
Senator Donnelly, You're okay with Iran to inspecting it's own?
@TheIranDeal @SenDonnelly
@SenDonnelly @WhiteHouse what will he do when they kill thousands with their new bank roll
@SenDonnelly @WhiteHouse very smart sir. Peace 1st and War as last resort
@SenDonnelly @WhiteHouse no good is coming from that. We as U.S. general population need that money first
@SenDonnelly @WhiteHouse "I cannot...shift the potential risks of 2026...to 2016." The point of ANY policy is to weigh and shift risk.
@SenDonnelly @WhiteHouse c'est formidable de lire cela, il faut beaucoup de soutiens c'est une situation vraiment délicate et anxieuse
@SenDonnelly @WhiteHouse so vote to give them the bomb then vote for military action hummm i was for it before i was against  it
@SenDonnelly @WhiteHouse bekliyom !!!
@SenDonnelly @WhiteHouse

 .
@SenDonnelly @WhiteHouse notice how the politicians exclude u from their deals, and secrets. Think about it People.
