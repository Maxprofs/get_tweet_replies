...and next year it will be my turn to Vote No to Joe
another terrible decision to not support Rex Tillerson for SOS. #indianaiswatching
Good job, Joe! #Resist
Thank you
Thank you for your integrity and courage on behalf of all that is just.
bad mic joe

Thank you for representing me and for voting NO to Rex Tillerson as Sec. of State.

thank you Joe!!!
Thank you for your opposition to Tillerson!
good!
Thank you for your "No" vote on Tillerson.
Acceptable.
Remember the people who elected you, not the party you're in.
thank you! You made this Hoosier proud today. #resist
Yes! Thank you, senator!!
thank you for your words and "no" vote, Joe!
Shane on you.   Your opposition is based on which  party the Sec state is from.
Always on the wrong side of history as usual. Start voting on merit and not on feelings! We Americans are tired of FEELINGS!
VOTE NO ON THIS RIDICULOUS CABINET! Filibuster! We vote for you- not them
GOOD JOB STANDING UP TO TILLERSON, JOE! you get my vote! Keep RESISTING!! We are counting on YOU to be our voice
Thank you, Joe.  Good points and great decision.
Joe forgetting the people who elected him, independents and swing Republicans due to poor Republican candidate.
Thank you!
Thank You Senator....you will have my vote!
You are not serving my interests are the interests of Hoosier's from now on vote to confirm Trump's Cabinet. you work for me
geez Monty-u have Todd to write to- don't be greedy
Your not getting re-electd as Indiana Senator. You care more about Democrats than your own State you are representing.
yeah! Thank you Senator Donnelly. It's gratifying to see a Hoosier in DC actually making sense. Keep it up. We need you!
Thank you for sticking up for us and America against Tillerson! Keep fighting for us!
Thanks, Joe!
once again you let your personal and liberal views get ahead of what is best for America
Thank you and please keep fighting the plutocracy!
thank you

can you get though to @SenToddYoung ?
Bad move Joe
.@SenDonnelly THANK YOU, JOE.

3 strikes and your out in Indiana Joe. Consider voting Hoosier values.

Thank you Senator. 2016 was warmest year in at least 100 millennia. Putting an oil CEO in charge is a bad idea. #climatechange

thank you!
Thank you. This disaster keeps rolling on, but thank you for speaking out.
.@SenDonnelly "Elephants Never Forget". That includes Hoosier "elephants"
Thank you.
TY. I am really concern with his ties with Putin but I guess @Sen_JoeManchin @SenatorHeitkamp @SenatorWarner could care less!
Hoosiers will remember this in 2018!
when you spout the dem talking points it really doesn't play here. That's why the Dems are losing in all but 5 states.
thank you Joe! @INDems @DearbornCtyDems
thank you Sen. Donnelly.

Yay, way to pick a low hanging fruit Donny.  Still in the pockets of big pharma thou.
I look forward to helping your 2018 re-elect in any way I can.
Thank you for your opposition to Tillerson and for providing Indiana Democrats a voice in their government.
being an obstructionist will get you no where. I'll remember your voting record when I vote in 2018 
Are you representing your constituants or your party?
you were in the right on Tillerson, thank you.
Thank you Sen. Donnelly! I wish @SenToddYoung would follow your lead.
Thank you for voting "no".  @SenDonnelly
large base of union that believes the same way I do you will have a wake up call 2018
I am one of your constituents and am one of the forgotten. Believe the union vote has turned because of the games being played!
thank you Sen Donnelly
did you not see how the last election turned out? If you continue these obstructionist games, you WILL be fired!
THANK YOU FOR TAKING A STAND. I will remember this in 2018. #DonnellySupporter
Thanks Joe!
As a constituent, I thank you for standing up for America and American excellence. You will be remembered for this.
Joe voted in favor of big pharmaceutical companies over Americans thanks Joe.
I'm right there with you. Weak democrats are the problem with the party.
thank you, both for your vote and for speaking out.
Thank you, Senator Donnelly. Keep up the good fight. We support you.
keep standing up to Trump's Billionaire Swamp Cabinet!!
Rex Tillerson is unqualified and will not serve our nation's interests. Good for you.
Thank you. But can't you talk some sense into @SenToddYoung?
Time to go Joe
Thank you Sir! Good to see you supporting your base. Our government has become very corrupt. #TheResistance #standingunited
