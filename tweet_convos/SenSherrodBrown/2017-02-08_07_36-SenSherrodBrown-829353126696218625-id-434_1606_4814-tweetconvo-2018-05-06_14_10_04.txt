.@SenSherrodBrown: "It's a sad day for our democracy...when the words of #CorettaScottKing are not allowed on the floor of the U.S. Senate." 
thank you for speaking up & not backing down thank you for representing us so well
what representation, nothing but obstruction.. foolish behavior
your opinion, not mine. I respect your opinion, please respect mine & that of others...
how is obstructing our President (overwhelmingly in OHIO) , respecting an opinion. Causing harm
the President works forbus If he is doing something he shouldn't needs to be stopped
Preventing his cabinet from being implemented ? Jeff Sessions is an honorable man being slandered.
No. Sessions being an honorable man is YOUR opinion. A lot of people don't think like that and you will have to respect it.
You "opinion" extends to a block, get out of our way, Alice
Thank you both and please keep fighting this fascist regime. We CANNOT lose our democracy.
You are harming our country and embarrassing yourself please stop calling everyone a racist/facidt
Truth hurts don't it?
Your in the same mental league with Mad Maxine Waters, scary you can drive, much less vote
@cspan MY SENATOR!
not for long
THANK YOU BOTH. THAT'S THE WINNING 2020 DEMOCRATIC TICKET RIGHT THERE!!!
Their conduct, along with their/your masked, blackhooded arsonists will lead to civil war if continued
Way to go, Senator Brown! This Ohio constituent is proud to have you fighting for us!
Are you loving the fact dems have no ideas other than constant complaints?
Senator Brown is one of Ohio's biggest heroes
nonsense
@patriot1077 @SenWarren So proud of both Sen Brown & Sen Warren! Thank you, we stand with you!!
Another proud constituent of Senator Brown. Thank you for speaking for those who were silenced.
She deserved to be silenced! We're SICK of the division! Watch Dr Alveda King's response! #timetoworktogether
you are the reason the left is losing. Mainstream USA can't stand it anymore.
Are you hiding millions in credit like Warren as well?

TY 4 the info
Warren-Brown 2020 I'll quit my job to work for that ticket

You forgot her letter warning about the threat of liberal immigration laws to blacks https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/1502287/coretta1991.pdf …

@senrobportman Sen Brown is way ahead on Twitter we hope YOU Portman get the message
.@SenWarren @SenSherrodBrown @SenSanders Thank you for re-reading #CorettaScottKing's words into our public record.
#TruthBearsNoShame
Where has @robportman been? We appreciate that you are doing your job Sherrod.
saw list, he voted to shut her up;seems obvious, part of reason she was silenced by Rethugs is that pesky extra X chromosome

Thank you Sen Brown from a proud Buckeye ! We must keep up the resistance against the racist & bigoted GOP !!
tell me again how republican's are racists and bigots? Do you even know your history?
2) Well - that title now belongs solely to the Returdlikkkans!You& no one else can dispute the fact!
and you still avoided my question. Typical liberal.
I don't believe in Alternative facts!The facts are this- Trumputin is screwing me, you&the entire country-& his cult doesn't care
read your history oh ignorant liberal.

you have rules to go by in the Senate, right? Then obey them!

#StillShePersisted #LetTheImpeachmentBegin

Digging your own grave with all of this obstructionism bullshit. Didn't get the message last three elections?
