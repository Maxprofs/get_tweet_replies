@WhiteHouse @POTUS Upwards of 20 million illegals are running around the country, and you dare say this?
@_donaldson @WhiteHouse @POTUS 1) theyre not "illegals", they're " undocumented Americans." 2) Obama deported more ppl than Bush wtf u sayin
@taylorrkenneth @WhiteHouse @POTUS 1) They're illegals, who get special rights while legal immigrants,like my spouse, do not.
@_donaldson @WhiteHouse @POTUS You're gonna have to prove to me that "illegal immigrants have more rights than legal immigrants..."
@taylorrkenneth @WhiteHouse @POTUS Now, what illegal has to do that? Obama is giving them free, what I spent tens of thousands on.
@_donaldson @taylorrkenneth @WhiteHouse @POTUS most undocumented Americans pay taxes, yet can't vote either...
@MooreDylan @taylorrkenneth @WhiteHouse @POTUS Lies.

@WhiteHouse @POTUS you've pissed on the Constitution for 7 years and should be in Jail
@keck1157 @WhiteHouse @POTUS eaaaat a diiiick teabagger

@WhiteHouse @TheDemocrats Please stop the charade of @POTUS pretending to give 2 shits about the constitution.

@WhiteHouse @POTUS let's hope like hell they do and send that unconstitutional judge home !
@WhiteHouse @POTUS The Senate is doing their Constitutional duty. They represent the people, not the Executive Branch. The people say, "No!"
@TheChappedHide @WhiteHouse @POTUS they represent the constitution.  Do your job Senate
@thunderstrck1 @WhiteHouse @POTUS Has the Constitution changed since 2005?
@SenatorReid on that Constitutional Duty.
@TheChappedHide @WhiteHouse @POTUS @SenatorReid @YouTube Re I'd is an IDIOT
@thunderstrck1 @WhiteHouse @POTUS @SenatorReid @YouTube And yet we play by his rules. Take your bitch up with him.
@TheChappedHide @WhiteHouse @POTUS @SenatorReid @YouTube Constitution
@thunderstrck1 @WhiteHouse @POTUS Here's @SenatorReid's instruction on the Constitutional duty of the Senate.
@TheChappedHide @WhiteHouse @POTUS @SenatorReid @YouTube one crazy man's interpretation
@WhiteHouse @POTUS
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Obama 4 live

@WhiteHouse @POTUS you have stepped all over the constitution!
@WhiteHouse @SenSherrodBrown @POTUS   Absolutely. POTUS couldn't have made a more fair, accommodating selection for this 4/4   Supreme Ct
@WhiteHouse The one and only time You decided to follow the Constitution of this country
@WhiteHouse @POTUS you have continued to stomp the constitution you are a complete and utter failure to this once great nation.
@WhiteHouse I agree!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS 
The most pointless act of your entire 8 years.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS This should be tattooed on Mitch McConnell's behind
@WhiteHouse @POTUS choosing only the duties you want to fulfill makes it easy. #SCOTUSnominee
@WhiteHouse @POTUS so now you want to follow the Constitution? Too late #nohearingnovotes
@WhiteHouse @SenSherrodBrown @POTUS  what a joke.  You are embarrassing.
@WhiteHouse @SCOTUSnom @POTUS Founders gave Senate Constitutional right not to act.
@WhiteHouse @zuzi_64 @POTUS Time2consider new rules in Senate.If they don't confirm a nom N 30 days,nom stands.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS and the Senate will be the check and balance.  Can't wait until your out of the White House.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Which includes deciding to not hold a vote on your nominee.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS The Senate has no duty in this matter, they have the power to act or not act.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS # POTUS, u can't spell CONSTITUTION !
@WhiteHouse @TheDemocrats @POTUS and Rep Senate will hold America hostage ..AGAIN
@WhiteHouse @POTUS First time for everything.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Yes, you have.
#blackpride
@WhiteHouse @POTUS I despise trolls...... Time to clean them out of my Twitter feed....
@WhiteHouse @POTUS exactly do it or look for another job hell u cant do this job u know jazzy
@WhiteHouse @POTUS  great choice didn't no who he was but he seems like a very fair man
.@WhiteHouse @SCOTUSnom @POTUS The current Senators should do as obama did as a Senator and NOT confirm.
#PaybackTime
@WhiteHouse @Senate_GOPs congress has been absent in their duties from the beginning, we will not vote for any incumbent seeking re-election
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Blah blah blah Cowards
@WhiteHouse @SenSherrodBrown @POTUS Like not enforcing immigration laws?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Since when do you care about the Constitution?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS 
Translation....I did what I was told by my handlers
Now vote this cracker down so I can go golf
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Their constitutional duty is to make their own rules for the senate and to confirm or block.  It is working just fine!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Their duty is to put it off till after new congress is seated.
@WhiteHouse @SenSherrodBrown @POTUS President Obama contradicts Senator Obama
@WhiteHouse @POTUS This highly qualified judge was available when you nominated nutcases Kagan & Sotomayor. Why NOW is he your choice?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS This is all about YOU! You just want to win.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS well let's follow the resolution passed in 1960. All presidents have followed that,what makes you so special to ignore
@WhiteHouse 
Now Obama hides his pride behind the Constitution...after unprecedented use of executive orders. Not a constitutionalist.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS
Time for GOP to vote like
Obama,Biden,Clinton,Kerry,Reid,Schumer,Durbin,
Leahy,Boxer,Feinstein,etc. did: http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=2&vote=00001 …
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse @SCOTUSnom @POTUS Wonderful nomination speech! Of course they'll hack it to pieces & accuse POTUS of being unconstitutional.
@WhiteHouse @FoxNews Picking yet another old white man as #SCOTUSnominee is SO disappointing, esp during #WomensHistoryMonth. Thx 4 nothing!
Shorter @WhiteHouse @POTUS
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Its nice to attack those that could nominate your judge. You should play nicer Obama.
@jakeshelton39 @potus @whitehouse All his nominees will be his choice. They have to pick one. As petty as ppl are,they have no choice now
@AFan_ofTruth @POTUS @WhiteHouse Actually they do have a say. At least the senators that elect them.
@jakeshelton39 @potus @whitehouse Ur missing the point. If you choose all the candy ur child gets 2 eat,doesn't matter which one they pick.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS it is their constitutional duty to block it! And I hope they fulfill it.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS
So much I, Me and My in that announcement, it felt like I was reviewing elementary schooler's self written biography
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Yay, POTUS did his job. Ok, Obama, take the rest of the week off. You deserve it, man.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS blocking the nominee is their duty.
.@WhiteHouse .@POTUS  #POTUS mic drop!!!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS to block it.
@ltruthhurtsl @WhiteHouse @POTUS that part is missing from this thing called "The Constitution"
@WhiteHouse @POTUS #Fact
@WhiteHouse @POTUS hahhhahahahah
@WhiteHouse @POTUS for once...
