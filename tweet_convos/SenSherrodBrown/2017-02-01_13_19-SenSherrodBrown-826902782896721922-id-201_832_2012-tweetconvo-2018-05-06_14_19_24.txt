GOP leaders move to shore up shaky DeVos nomination http://bit.ly/2kTh6iH  
Thank you for your good work, your good conscience, your voice for the people of Ohio!
hey if DeVos gave @robportman $51k in campaign funds can we pull together $52k to swing his vote?
These two women Collins & Murkowski,are The only Rep. senators showing some balls,  I mean courage-the rest are spineless
most of the Dems are clueless political hacks that are only good at being obstructionist.
I think someone has their parties confused!
I don't think so. The republicans didn't behave like idiots with Obamas nominations.
UR they didnt. Bc Obama had sound choices. Dems are only trying to check him on his bad choices
meant to say "ur right, they didn't"
thank you for fighting for our kids.  Public schools are worth it.
not fair comparisons, these other countries don't aim to educate all their children.
please vote NO
@senrobportman Am I wrong that there is a GOP Doners Meet&Greet in PlamBeach today?We want answers!VOTE NO DeVos!Kids loose
Thank you!  Proud to have you as my Senator!  #holdthefloor

what does that have to do w devos? I get it, you hate us. Don't punish all the children because you hate dem's

What more can we do to convince Sen. Portman to vote NO on DeVos? (in Cincinnati) We continue to call, email, tweet, picket
please oppose this nomination.
stay strong no to DeVos!
would be nice if @senrobportman felt the same
Thank you Sen Brown. Voters will remember your courageous opposition to a bad choice for education secretary. Not qualified
unions oppose her, educators support her.
LOL no they don't. What planet do you live on? Speak Russian much?
Say  NO to Devos!  We don't.want  her ignorant self in any department. No!
Thank you for listening to us! I hope @senrobportman does the same.
You ranked 74 out of 98 on 2015 The Lugar Center - McCourt School Bipartisan Index.  Could you do better?
She will be a disaster for public education..
@SenRobPortman are you with @SenSherrodBrown in protecting Ohio education??
"Shaky" is being polite. Completely unqualified! #NotoDeVos
Partisanship has destroyed us. Congress has had a pass for too long.   We must confront this issue and demand change
Thank you for your opposition!
Oppose!!
As a registered republican (who always looks to both sides) I thank you for a no vote.
Thank you!!! Please get @senrobportman to do the same.
#resist
I don't want her approved BUT I want you and the rest if the Democratics to get to WORK!!
thank you for voting no on DeVos.
@SenateDems Why? None of you are. You've attempted to undermine EVERY Cabinet pick & policy to date. #partisanhacks
students parrot teachers, teachers don't want change, and parents want our vouchers!!! Bring it on!!!
ohio schools cheat and cant compete let her through
.@SenSherrodBrown I am so thankful and proud to have @senrobportman as my Senator.
The Dems should never t say anything.. they have failed miserably on the education front.. fact!
@rollcall It is unacceptable to hear Republican leadership so out of touch with the people's real fears w/her. Vote no!
@SenateDems the teachers union opposes her and you are bought and paid for by the teachers union you're a disgrace
@SenateDems  we want education that leads to the ever tolerant UC BERK.why do dems love violence?why do they hate gays?
You only want to listen to the left wing nuts in Calf. & New York.  This is OHIO and we don't want you!
oh, if only you truly understood us Ohioans.
thought u we're tougher then u seemed to be this could end of violent and if he starts nucing country let be prepared
@rollcall Thank u! DeVos=Bad 4 pub sch, 4 kids w/ disablty, 4 title IX/sex asslt vctms. Plz join Sen Brown #noDeVos
I REALLY appreciate this. Please get @senrobportman to vote NO too. Thank you.
Not true.Do support her. Linda Sarsour's movement supporting Sharia Law, is encouraging opposition. Definitely appoint her.
@rollcall thank you for listening! I have called & tweeted @robportman I pray he follows what the people want. #DumpDevos
this woman must be stopped...the USGov just cannot cave to trumps molls. esp one who has never participated in public ED
I left voicemails for @senrobportman. Now I'm trying to e-mail his chief of staff. Maybe that will work better.
please speak W/ Sen. Portman re: being bold for OH, she is not good for us, failed us W/ charters. Be hero
Thank you, Senator Brown for speaking up for our kids!
now you want to listen. Listen to this i not voting for you unless you stop acting like a baby
@rollcall Thank you, Sen. Brown for opposing #devos Hope @marcorubio  and @SenBillNelson will vote NO also.
Tell Portman, that, please.
ugh, I've been calling Portman twice a day this week. He's not listening to anyone. His fb page is blowing up.
THANK YOU for thinking of those in Ohio! For listening to YOUR people.
Thank you for fighting the good fight
unbelievably scary how incompetent she is. Thank you for no vote!
As a public school teacher- THANK YOU for your support!!
Outstanding, Loveland is behind you.
@robportman please vote NO on #DeVos. A yes vote puts our children at risk.
Oh, shut up and get out your coloring book in a safe space you wacko liberal!!
this kid thanks you! Diversity rules! All kids deserve to learn! #notodevos
Keep up the pressure senator.
#Devos Thanks for saving me a call to your office tomorrow.

@SenateDems   Every other nominee has been rubber stamped and pushed through.  Stand firm on NO on DeVos.
Unqualified!!
Thank you for listening to your constituents and their opposition of #Devos. #educationmatters
@senrobportman I am a parent and a teacher. I oppose #Devos she is not good for our education system in this country.
@rollcall @senrobportman Please oppose DeVos. She is unqualified and a poor choice. Please listen to the people.
#DeVos She is a train wreck. She should not be in that position.
Right, DO NOT cram her through like Tillerson (bad). She is NOT appropriate.
.@SenSherrodBrown Thank you for being the sane voice amidst the chaos. Stay strong!!
@rollcall we need your help to get through to @senrobportman !!!! He will not respond to constituents!
@SenateDems @SenateGOP Please @GOP you've filled cabinets with conflicts/ethics problems. Please do note confirm DeVos
DeVos is an imperious plutocrat who thinks her wealth entitles her to power b/c she knows what's best for the peasants
thank you for opposing #Devos. @senrobportman please join your Ohio colleague in voting no.
