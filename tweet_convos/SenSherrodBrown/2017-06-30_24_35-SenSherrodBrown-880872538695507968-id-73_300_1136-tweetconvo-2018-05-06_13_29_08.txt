Breaking: Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted Reported to FBI & DoJ for Fraud #SolidarityIs #thursdaythoughts #Election2016 #imwithher #obama 
I would still keep an eye on him about voter suppression. Also I do not want my info handed to a administration that's involved in treason.
This is great news!
It's time to look at article 25 in the constitution.  Enough is enough.. Mr. Trump is #UnfitToServe
Thank you Mr. Brown & Mr. Husted. Please continue to keep our voting records private.
Why mislead OH voters by compliment'g @jonhusted? 
He partly complied send'g our vot'g 'public' info w/o consent to multi-convictd Kobach.
Thank you! This was a ridiculous request
Glad he did too. Glad your my senator

Thank you Mr Secretary and Senator Brown for your courage and convictions.
Stop watching Fux News & listening to Breitbart & Alex Jones moron !!
Voter fraud is an affront to democracy, what is there to hide? All info requested is public info. Privacy Strawman.
So does Husted, he's just doing it at the state level. Republicons in Ohio have a tradition of voter suppression and gerrymandering.
Why is Washington Post reporting we partially complied??
That's RIGHT! #UnhacktheVote #VoterSupression #StopGerrymandering 
#SavetheRepublic #25th
Good for @JonHusted! With this executive order the Trump Administration went full Hugo Chavez: https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/chang-tai.hsieh/research/maisanta_april%202009_final.pdf …
How is that standing up for legal voters? We have dead people voting and still on the rolls.
Thank you so much for this I tweeted Gov Kasich about this.Thank the AG for me.
Thank goodness!
Agreed. This must stop. Voting should not be partisan. It's a right of every US citizen and all should be educated and encouraged.
Thank you!
No info should be given, public or not. Let them come get it.
The state of Ohio shouldn't turn our private information over to an administration that is in cahoots with Russia!! I don't trust Trumputin!
Since when have democrats ever been concerned about wasting taxpayer dollars? I call bullsh!t on that.
Because the Returdlikkkans have never wasted taxpayer money right ? Trumps golf trips, Melania in NYC, the Trumputin clan vacations !!
Please make sure my information is keep private! @senrobportman @RepSteveChabot DO NOT GIVE OUT MY IMFORMATION! #OhioVoter
Thank you
You are always on right side
Excellent.  Thank you @SenSherrodBrown for tweeting this. I was wondering what Ohio was going to do.
Again, thank you sir! Also, thank you Mr. Husted!
Thank you Secretary Husted!
Of course you Democrats want to protect voter fraud, that's how you win elections.
This is great news, thank you both!
Thank u again, Senator Brown, for standing up for Ohioans best interests. Ur courage in today's political climate is rare and we r grateful.
Very happy to hear this! I was worried @JohnKasich would be all for it.
Duh you're a @TheDemocrats YOU really don't want the fraud broadcasted @SenSherrodBrown is ok with voter fraud..let US down @WCPO @700 @WLWT
Thanks for everything you do for Ohio and our country!
I will admit that I was very concerned about @OhioSOSHusted @JonHusted not doing right for OH voters.
And when will we be seeing the official statement from his office?
If Reporters, SoS, Governors, Senators, Reps, Real News, WH Staff all stand together and say ENOUGH IS ENOUGH perhaps @POTUS will notice
Marylanders: Call the MD Board of Elections TODAY & tell them not to cooperate with Trump's request for MD voter data. No #VoterSuppression!
Wasn't it Husted who tried to,or did, keep 17 yr.olds from voting in primaries for pres. candidates when they would be 18 b4 general?
The Secretary of State shouldn't know who I voted for. So how could he pass that info on anyhow?
@rolandopablos Is selling us out here in Texas, degrading American values and societal norms. Disgusted and motivated to change things here.
So good to hear, I just called his office this afternoon on this issue.
It says "some but not all" in the article I read.....not a pleasant thought to caring voters.  Trump will be adding it to his huge data base
My sincerest thanks to you Sen. Brown & @jonhusted for protecting Ohioans' privacy. This is how republicans & Dems should work together.
I am so glad our calls were heard!
Voting is a right and it is private. Thank you, Senator Brown.
Thank you and Mr Husted
I'll give Secretary Husted kudos for that.
Thank you Jon Husted. @JonHusted
I agree that Federalism is a good thing. Could've used your support for Federalism last 8 years though too.
Stop trying to cover up #VoterFraud DEMOCRATS! Rolls requested. Not details of for whom people voted.
The federal government has no right to those data.
Why wouldn't they?Repub run States don't seem to have a problem cooperating with #VoterFraud investigation of NATIONAL Presidential election
Been hammering Kasich and Husted about this on social media. Is there an official statement online?
Well said, Senator!  Thanks for your hard work.
Whooo hooo. Strong statement from Ohio! Wonder what RP will say?
I very glad my personal  voter info will not be given to Kobach
Thank you @SenSherrodBrown and Secretary Husted for protecting our voter privacy from this witch hunt!
Thanks to you and Secretary Husted for doing the undoubtedly right and justified thing.
Thank you Secretary Husted! I was waiting to see what he would do. Kudos!
