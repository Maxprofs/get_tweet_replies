JUST IN: In one of first Trump admin. orders, Dept of Housing & Urban Dev. suspends reduction of FHA annual mortgage insurance premium rates
@CNBCnow can't keep saving rates at 0% forever Retirees counted on savings interest in their old age for decades!
what??!!
No More Obama, Abortions and males showering with females in schools 
Great day for America!
Instead - dirty old man who likes hookers; E. European nude model: and no rate cut for your kid who wants to buy 1st home.
I'm sorry Melania's Elegance and Beauty threatens you sweetheart 
God Bless @POTUS @FLOTUS and their family 
Keep on being a dumbshit because she 'looks' good in a designer dress. Facial muscles that actually work, sooo overrated.
the devil always speaks angrily out from those who who lost their souls 
God and Country returned to America
You're pitiful and weak, easily led by the nose. Now I know why you fell victim to a man like Donald Trump. Pathetic.
rolling my eyes at sherrod, America voted your ideas dowwwwwwwnnnnnnn.....
not so. America's vote wasn't honored, remember?
Yes it was, fair and square.  Denial doesn't look good on you all. So funny!!
actually, the pop vote reflects people's will. Electoral college does not. Look it up. He won- w Russian help.
ROTFLMAO!!!
that's what I'm saying. Legitimate president 
it's okay, go to your safe space, hide from the facts, poor little democrat, boo hoo
ummm, I don't need ur fake pity or ur patronizing. U r the one who bought n2 a false narrative and voted 4 a con
FHA MIP premium reduction does not cause a housing bubble. Wall Street financial engineering does.
Wrong! homeowners will be stuck paying higher insurance premiums on FHA-insured mortgages.
if can't pay $29 more a month on $200,000 mtg, don't ned to buy!
avg. savings after reduction was $900/year and the reduction affected over 2mil loans.
He should have stopped it! Had already been reduced 1/2%! How you fig average?
referring to first cut. New cut projected savings at $500/yr/loan. My bad
@CNBCnow Does lying Democrat think internet doesn't exist? This HUD move was made w/o consultation. That's why repealed.
We know that you're not surprised Sherrod.  What we don't know is WTF you intend to do about this?!?!?!
Loved the irony on FB with my fellow realtors who voted trump now bitchin' because their deals just died.
if $50 killed your FHA purchase then it was bad from the start.
It's called debt to income ratio.
@CNBCnow will you support the Syrian refugees?  Will you please speak out on this?  I am a constituent. Please do right!
Interest rate cuts are artificial means of making the economy appear healthier than it really is.No more smoke & mirrors.
And you Vote to put Carson in charge of it. Shame on you Senator
@SenateDems @CNBCnow Now how are trump supporters going to spin this? Their life will be better if they pay more???
Maybe the government should buy everyone their first home?
You're an idiot. Obama implemented that policy days before he left office. If it was such a great policy, why now?
As usual, the Left is uninformed and got it wrong....AGAIN...
@CNBCnow Why is that so important that it needs to be one of his 1st acts?
Hadn't gone into effect yet. People won't miss it. Rs didn't like it.
agree. Why is the new administration targeting new home owners?
, as a liberal Ohio voter I'm very disappointed with the democrats ultimate support of Trump's unqualified cabinet picks
@CNBCnow 
Thank you and we don't want to pay for the wall either. Bridges, roads needed more.
@CNBCnow why is Congress getting the word out to all Americans. This is helping Corporate and Big Banks and Trump Ego.
its not that he made it more expensive, he just made it so its not so easy & denied the reduction for FHA
Yeah, that predatory lending and the housing collapse under Barry really worked out so well...........
please explain your backing of Ben Carson as HUD secretary.
@CNBCnow yet you approved crazy Ben Carson. Shame on you!! Can't wait for prayer to be a precondition for HUD housing.
@SenateDems @CNBCnow Need 2 qualify first 4 a mortgage,I remember paying 12% 4 a 15 yr. Fixed rate 1985 & bit the bullet.
@SenateDems @CNBCnow This is one of the many bullshit deals created by the Dems,remember Barney Frank,not everyone can own!
@SenateDems @CNBCnow No but it will eliminate another mortgage default with u Dems.pushing 4 borrowers not qualified 2 buy!
you have the wrong numbers-  $500/ year increase = $1.39/DAY.  It's not a huge deal, just a little FU to the working class.
tax payers bailed out FHA last time Barney Frank got all free houses for everyone on us.
@2020pleasehurry @CNBC FHA loans are for people with lower incomes.Way to go Trump helping lower income families get homes.
first time homebuyers, not necessarily low income. Still an obnoxious opening move.
wrong
@CNBCnow
@SenateDems @CNBCnow no American dream for some 
#FAKENEWS good try. Not fooling people anymore. https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1674369419243571&set=a.1543743402306174.1073741827.100000115886576&type=3&theater …
Leftist gov interference caused the housing bubble and 08 crash. Sit down.
Cut the crap. Wall Street greed is what caused it. Stop with the lies.
Wall Street donated most to Hillary. Why? Dems help them.
Doesn't excuse your filthy lie. Banks selling toxic mortgages knowing they will fail
Banks were FORCED to make bad loans by Dems. As a rule they don'y make $ from foreclosures. @SenSherrodBrown @SenSchumer
Lie! Banks were not forces to do anything. They made money by selling these risky loans
You're a sockpuppet propaganda account. bye @SenSherrodBrown @SenSchumer
More name calling. Very republican of you.

-majority who take these loans lose home
I have it but got pt job&pension kicked in-
@MegMurrayMusic
Have you been on Long Island lately? No one can afford the taxes.!
You need to confirm Scott Pruitt immediately. Get on it right away. Obama had 7 Cabinet members early @SenSherrodBrown @SenSchumer @CNBCnow
As someone who works in the mortgage industry, this really upset me. This will not help the economy.
Nor does making it easier for people to get homes they can't afford.
strated to read it got busy throught it wasn't a good thing not good way to strat  your first day in office
@SenateDems FHA needs a 2% capital reserve ratio. Now @ 2.32%. PMI cut would cost $5 B in 1st yr. and put reserve below 2%.
@SenSchumer Poor get poorer because you help them do stupid things and don't protect the rest of the county from mistakes
How abt preventing another housing bubble like #Dem's created 2007 & devastated middle class. Another lie by D
didn't the financial crisis occur mainly due to mortgages provided to people that simply could not afford it?
@CNBCnow remember when the democrats gave Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae low rates and the housing market collapsed the economy
it'll stop housing bubbles like the one the democrats created in the 90's and early 2000's @SenateDems @CNBCnow oh
@phebert48 @CNBCnow is someone keeping a list of all the shit we have to re-do in 4 years?
@SenSchumer @CNBCnow it won't be more expensive for Americans to buy their first homes... it will be the same as it is now.
@SenSchumer @CNBCnow that so buyers have more equity less interest and when bubble breaks they keep the home. No repro
@CNBCnow stop spinning! Obama had alreadydropped it 1/2% in 2015! http://www.housingwire.com/articles/32533-its-official-obama-to-direct-fha-to-cut-mortgage-insurance-premiums … we are not all idiots!
FHA brought on the last housing recession made loans citizens could not afford
TRUMPmaking more jobs available to citizens  Dems brought the last recession made loans people could not repay
@SenateDems @CNBCnow maybe now the democrats can't create a credit bubble and collapse the housing market
@SenateDems @CNBCnow finally doing something to keep democrats away from the housing market this time. Good fix
@SenSchumer @CNBCnow if they can't pay $29.00/mo on $200,000 mtg. they don't need to be buying!
@SenateDems o really??? Maybe when those Americans default on their mortgages the Democrat Party can pay them??? Sound good
@SenSchumer Schumer practices fear tactics.  Example: Repeal of ACA millions will lose insurance - replacement?
... you have a chance to change this.  Our future is in your hands
@CNBCnow Do the people who voted for him know this?
tell the truth. The cur never went into play yet. Barry should not gave done that on his way out. #tellthetruth
@SenSchumer $200k home, saves $29.00 month. My ACA, 1200 mth,6k ea ded, fam 4, 20yrs self empl,no subsidy. Get the picture?
@SenSchumer He couldn't wait to start screwing Americans. Sad!
Already bailed FHA out once Their reserves are dangerously low fiscally responsible thing was done Or do u want collapse
It's okay thanks to gentrification and increasing wealth disparity we can't afford homes anyway :-D! :(
@SenSchumer How is it more expensive? You just won't get to reduced mortgage insurance rate.
@CNBCnow #MAGA  conman
@SenateDems @CNBCnow Home purchases down under #Obama because of stagnant incomes and regulations!
dems want to give pay outs thru housing scams to stay in office & keep living richest citiy in U.S. @CNN @oann
paying off ur buddies and causing banking crisis w/badi loans is what dems are all about - DRAIN THE SWAMP!
hey democratic congress protesting inauguration - voters won't forget. say goodbye in 2018!
@denajo @CNBCnow it's gonna be cool, because we're all about to get rich, right? Isn't that the promise? #smgdh
They're starting already! Whatever Trump says, you can expect the exact opposite!
This cost my daughter $190/mo on mortgage for her first home in Northern Virginia.  This is helping working families Trump style.
@CNBCnow it was the democrats that wanted people to have a house but couldn't afford it. Easy credit led to the collapse!
fha needs an overhaul. The foreclosures are wrecking the real estate markets in low income areas.
Sir, you can't even fix the broken, unjustified gun laws in our state. So, I don't see where you have any room to talk!
@SenSchumer @CNBCnow I think the facts speak to why he signed it. Do you guys ever try telling the truth?
You are terribly misguided.  You do not have any common sense,neither one of you.  And we are tired of lies.
@SenateDems @CNBCnow - why did he act, think through the facts
@CNBCnow I stand by Sherrod Brown! You are an honest man of integrity that I trust
