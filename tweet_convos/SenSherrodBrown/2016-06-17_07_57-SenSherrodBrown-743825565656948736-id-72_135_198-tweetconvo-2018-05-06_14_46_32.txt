If we ban these assault weapons their will be no fear of tipping off suspected terrorist because they are banned.
Ban weapons that are already banned. Good plan. @mssnowwhitty @ChrisMurphyCT @twitter
they are not or they would not be giving one away today in TN. The bill that banned them was not renewed
Idk I'm not trying to buy one.
AR15 is an assault weapon
How do we know these minimal gun sale laws are we not actually encouraging terrorist to come to our country?
not just talking guns. Nobody wants to take your guns. No assault weapons
actually this is incorrect. There have been several total confiscation bills proposed throughout the country.
Why can't we be responsible w our gun ownership and not be afraid of safety & some restrictions
Why do these people who buy these AR15s? Is there a war here in honeland that the rest of us are not aware of?? Tks
#AskMurphy Next time we #filibuster can we talk about a national fracking ban?
FRACKING is bad news - for people and places - research h the topic people that are for it
what does the CEO drinking what ever have to do with it?
again do we need to ask 2020 or some tv show to look at the fracking Dangers ? Lets be real
UR just a NRAbot, "Sally". and bots don't matter! #AskMurphy
Why do you keep lying about guns?
#AskMurphy are there other Constitutional rights you'd like to abolish, after you kill the #2ndAmendment?

oh for Christ's sake "Scott", grow up. & stop sucking NRA dick! U don't know where it's been #AskMurphy
can you answer his question? How many amendments would you repeal? @ScottInSC
hate to tell y'all but an AR15 is Not an assault rifle. It is just a simi automatic rifle.
From filibustering the #CivilRightsAct to filibustering #DueProcess …how proud are you @ChrisMurphyCT? #AskMurphy
#AskMurphy is your disingenuity and aversion to truth born, or learned?
UR amazing! Is there a way to include lifting ban on CDC gun stats & Drs talking guns to patients?
#AskMurphy why did you mislead people about their 2nd amendment rights and tell so many lies during your filibuster?
#AskMurphy I guess you don't have an answer as to why you want to circumvent the 2nd and 5th amendments? I didn't think so...
#AskMurphy wouldn't you be more comfortable in China?
#AskMurphy Aren't many that are on the no fly list on there in error? It's not reliable
Is your problem dishonesty or stupidity?
Why do you hate the Constitution? #AskMurphy
You swore an oath to defend the Constitution. Keep your oath and stop assaulting our rights. @ChrisMurphyCT @twitter
Having taken oath to defend and uphold constitution, are you ashamed to push unconstitutional laws? #AskMurphy
are any of the amendments in the bill of rights more or less important than the others?  #AskMurphy
which civil right are you more excited about shredding? The 2nd or 5th Amendment?
If your argument is so compelling, why did you lie so frequently?
Say you get additional gun restrictions passed.. Now what? What's your plan to stop terrorists from attacking?
what laws are you proposing that would have actually stopped the Orlando shooting?  #AskMurphy
.@ChrisMurphyCT Your profile picture is your Snapcode. Why should we take you seriously? #AskMurphy
#AskMurphy @ChrisMurphyCT @twitter
My question is, “Why did you lie so much during your filibuster?” https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/06/17/fact-checking-three-democratic-claims-on-assault-rifles-and-guns/ … https://twitter.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/743819820681039872 …
Ppl on campuses w/open carry are being told to be careful of what they say. Why is what allowed? #AskMurphy
#AskMurphy Why do you continue to lie so much that @washingtonpost had to Fact Check you?
#AskMurphy @ChrisMurphyCT 

Did you know about the @codepink vigil at the NRA Monday night?  Will you join us?
Is Islamism an existential threat to life in America? @ChrisMurphyCT #AskMurphy
Campus carry puts campuses as risk - how can that be stopped? #AskMurphy
#AskMurphy @ChrisMurphyCT What is the actual reason why we can't pass #NoFlyNoBuy?
#AskMurphy @ChrisMurphyCT what do you say to @SpeakerRyan when you see him at the gym ?  #filibuster

#AskMurphy @ChrisMurphyCT what do you say to Ted when you see him in the halls of the Senate?

#askMurphy As a victim of gun violence, thank you! Are you optimistic any bills will pass?
//thank you for being there in a time of need senator murphy :-) thanks for shaking them loose from StateOfLethargy
#AskMurphy I ask because the pro gun rhetoric online has gotten scary
Are there any plans to influence FBI procedures & how long people stay on the watch list? #AskMurphy
Do you support John Cornyns idea?
Amen!
#askmurphy I do not have a question. I just want to thank you for your bravery.
that was fabulous,  thank you Senator!
Thank you Senator for defining what a Statesman is.
If we tax tobacco & soda to cover healthcare costs they cause & influence behavior can't we do same with bullets?
a good idea and increase back ground checks - stop corner stores from selling them -stop mail orders
Can we get healthcare pros in on this? They must be tired of treating gun shot victims?
I'm rooting for you but doubt the GOP House will pass. Will you try again after the election, should be better?
fantastic!
#askmurphy @ChrisMurphyCT what is the criteria to get on a no fly list and how do you get off if added by mistake?
