I share your concern. Sessions fought racial equality, women’s rights, and voting rights. He shouldn't be AG.
@PeterCorless Thank you for being on the right side of history Senator Brown:)
thank you - I hope both @SenBillNelson  & @senmarcorubio vote the same. This shouldn't be a blue vs red vote-
I have my doubts about Marc. He is too wishy washy. I hope he has balls tho
.@SenSherrodBrown Thank you for standing up for your beliefs and not supporting @SenatorSessions for AG. I grew up in Ohio. Keep fighting!
KKK Byrd was considered an icon in in your party and now you want to act righteous. Give me a break!
Steve try and get a clue about Byrd
.@HEINSLERJAN .@SenSherrodBrown Janet; not only did he establish & lead the KKK in WV, he filibustered against the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
I guess you want to set the bar as low as Eric & Loretta. You're "concerned" w Sen Sessions? I would describe it more as spiteful
Thank you for your vote against Jeff Sessions whom we think would be a great setback in the progression of our equality!
the best you can do is embarrass and discredit him. The GOP is a rubber stamp. @kharyp
Am grateful for your stand. Hope you will also honor constituents and supporters by not attending the inauguration.
The good people of Ohio need to really focus on removing this Democrat fool @SenSherrodBrown from office.
Thank you for refusing to support Sen. Sessions.
Dear Senator Brown Congratulations on your stand.
You are making this Ohio voter proud to be an Ohioan once again.
bravo Senator!
But that unborn baby can be ripped from mothers womb and you have no problem with that! Sen Sessions better man that you.

Thank you, Senator Brown, for standing up for all of us.
and your mailbox is full can one of your aides please clear messages or answer the phone thank-you
I am concerned that these appointees have not been properly vetted. Missing background checks and ethical checks.
Thank you.
Thanks for opposing him! Justice not supremacy must prevail or we can descend into anarchy!
@VeraHiggs That's putting it lightly.
Thank you, Senator! Sessions is a bad choice for AG. He would send civil rights & women's rights to the graveyard of history.
.@SenSherrodBrown Contd: Wealth limits would protct dmocracy by harnessng th rich's power & control over polticians, the world, & our lives!
.@SenSherrodBrown We MUST set a $ LIMIT on wealth that any 1 person may hold. $ above that goes 2 pay services/benfits 4 th people. Cont'd.
Peopl of conscience, & 2 that I add of morals & ethics, MUST reject @SenatorSessions .His racist views r h8ful & poisonous.
thank you.
is there a sliver of reason in government? Now how about calling trump #unfit to be our pres?
It's a dangerous place we go
Thank you Senator.  I support that decision.
Are you upset he destroyed the Klan? 
Bravo! Thank you for standing up and being a patriot
Thank you for speaking out senator! Please continue to stand your ground and Do NØthing For Trump!
Thank you, Senator.
