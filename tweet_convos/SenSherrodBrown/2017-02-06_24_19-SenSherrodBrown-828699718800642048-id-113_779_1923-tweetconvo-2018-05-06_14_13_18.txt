Union butt boy. Dems can't afford to loss any more voters. Need NEA $ and foot soldiers. Man of the people please
@ungaggedEPA Thank you, from a former Ohioan and current federal employee.
As a citizen of Ohio and frequent hiker in the NPs, thank you.
Haha, big surprise... @SenSherrodBrown announces opposition... #justnoise
Thank you from the bottom of my heart! He didn't even know there is no safe lead level in a child's blood.
My 3 year old has #leadpoisoning from our home. We need the head of EPA to know the damage it causes families like mine.
@SenCapito @Sen_JoeManchin "Pruitt's record speaks for itself..." His nomination is fundamentally wrong!! TY Senator Brown
Have we completely forgotten about trump's tax return or his russian connection.
Thank you for your integrity.  If only our other Senator would represent the people's interests.

I AM FRIGHTENED!!!. This is our ground water in Copley, Ohio - caused by coal industry.  Who is going to help protect us?
I agree. Only nominee I'm impressed with so far is Sec. of Defense, and that's contingent on how much he stands up to Trump
you are absolutely right!! Please resist Scott Pruitt at every turn!! Dem constituent in Dayton O
