@NASA whose fault was that? Shouldn't have launched as it was too cold. The seal didn't function at that temperature.
@guntle @NASA way to dredge up pointless information. This is a tweet of remembrance, not of outdated finger pointing. RIP explorers.
@WoodyWouldntHe we certainly wouldn't want to learn from our mistakes!
@guntle @WoodyWouldntHe You're about 12.5 and 29.5 years behind the curve Thomas. That's when the accident reports were issued.
@WoodyWouldntHe What curve is that? We aren't talking about geometry. We are talking about how bureaucracys can kill people.
@guntle The learning curve, as in you're behind it not knowing about the Columbia and Challenger accident boards.
@WoodyWouldntHe Just wondering why people use meaningless buzz words like "learning curve" instead of just simple clear words.
@guntle 'learning curve' isn't clear to you? OK. Now I understand. Thanks for your time.
@NASA @Astro_Ron The Challenger tragedy really made me reflect  . . .  so I became a teacher for the second time .
@NASA @Astro_Ron that was not a good year for me

@NASA we will always remember #Challenger crew, made a mark on our honeymoon! #sad #USA
@NASA @allisunrae It's hard to believe it's been 30 years.  I remember it like it was yesterday.  I still cringe when I hear/see about it.
@KSukEDUC @NASA Always gets me emotional & I wasn't even born yet! Very heartbreaking.

@NASA My father worked on every one of these launches.He and his division tracked the trajectory of the flights.Passed away last year.
@NASA Those who were old enough at the time can remember exactly where we were when we leaned of the tragedy. God Bless those brave souls.

@NASA we must remember to reach for the stars and never give up. The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave.
