Cleveland Indians and Hillary Clinton both have in common, you can't win all of the time. Losing builds character.

If only you had cried to the baseball commissioner and gotten some Cubs suspended! It's the only way a Cleveland team can win.

, no more Billy the Goat and Steve Bartman Curses  ! Congratulations to the MLB Champions Chicago Cubies ! Great 3-1 comeback !
I was at game 2 years ago when my @royals lost by 1! @Indians have a good team and could do exactly what Royals did in 2015! !
I said the same thing.
I was at gm 1 in kc when they lost to S.F. pence hit HR under my signs
Yeh cause of bum ass James Shields

Cleveland Indians logo:ugly racist caricature http://nyti.ms/2e2SvDA    by @DLeonhardt  Please do what you can to push for change
You're a great representative for Cleveland- please help push for positive change & respect for all people in our community.
Hi Lebron- love Cavs, don't like Indians. Racist logo HAS to go! Disgraceful for Cleveland and players who have to wear it.
CUBS ALL DAY!!! SORRY LJ. THAT WAS BEAST GAME THOUGH. THEY BOTH DESERVED IT.
Instead of living in the moment, in order to become a champ, why not just create a super team like your home town hero does?!  Ha
Yankees played last night?
the cubs 3-1 comeback was better then yours #FlyTheW #WorldSeries
golden state says karma is a bitch
