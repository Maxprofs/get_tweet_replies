We cannot let politicians in Washington, with taxpayer funded healthcare, pull the rug out from under Ohio families and communities.
Can you please have a talk with your fellow Ohio Junior @senrobportman?
OPERS 2018 prices for insurance for 1 $1,159.61 per month! The #ACA has not helped my family.  @@POTUS44
CongressionalDeathSquads if you will.
#GrahamCassidy is just another name for "fuck the American people."
Thank you Senator, for being the voice of reason here in Ohio! If only @robportman had some guts!
Thank you for fighting against this bill. Your hard work is appreciated in #Ohio.
Which is another name for murdering people. I know that sounds pretty harsh, but the truth must be acknowledged.
Wouldn't be an issue under single payer. So much of the world has single payer. If u don't support S1804 I will not support u #supportS1804
Medicare for all.
Medicaid for all. Medicare doesn't cover crap.
Ready for @JoshMandelOhio to take your seat and represent Ohio. #RepealAndReplace #GrahamCassidy #ObamacareIsDead
We know that. Governor Kasich knows that. Please attempt to explain it to @senrobportman
facilitating Ohio to become a welfare state.   26% of Ohioans receiving Medicaid.
I heartily agree. Keep fighting and we will too.
I only wish you had cosponsored the Medicare For All plan.
DO SOMETHING BIG! I've called. emailed. tweeted. Do something! Organize on the steps, on the floor. Be LOUD!
PLEADE HELP US DEFEAT THIS BILL.We CANT FIGHT OLIGARCHS WITHOLDING $ from GOP til they pass it.
Think I know your vote, but just reminding you to vote no on Graham-Cassidy.
I am ready to see our Ohio representatives step up. I don't care if you are Republican or Democrat. Vote no, please.
#GrahamCassidy death care.

Tell me, Senator, why can we always afford corporate welfare/bail outs & perpetual war?
@Cripipper Shame on Dr @BillCassidy. A physician who is charged with "Do not harm". We WILL remember at the polls. #Evil
What smart electable woman is running against old Lindsay ne t time??
CBO score , we would be able to fact check  how many ppl would lose w this deathcare bill. Repubs don't want us to know .Pass it then verify
You have great insurance, So give it up and take the pounding like the rest of us
Thank you, Senator. Now, if you could support Single Payer we can be free of this madness once and for all.
But @LindseyGrahamSC & @BillCassidy will get their dirty #KochBucks so all good, right?
Convince your colleague @robportman to stand with the citizens of Ohio who say NO to #GrahamCassidy .
Absolutely Senator Brown we know we can trust you to have our backs on this healthcare&many more bills to come thank you
In order to give a massive tax cut to their donors to keep the money flowing in. How swampy.
Please please  talk to @senrobportman about this...

I am so grateful for you.
And, It's a death sentence for those with pre-existing conditions. #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
So true.
Its an ethnic cleansing of poor people.
Nuts
Stop them !!
I'm viscerally disgusted by this sick attempt for the GOP to gain political capital by this baffling behavior based on corporate nepotism.
It's again גואל נפש
Sherrie Brown just another name for a lying cheating stealing politician
@FinalFenwayFict #GrahamCassidy will murder millions of US citizens, including me. Stop it! Cut deals! Twist arms!
It's time for single-payer if you're not on board you're going to be left behind
GOP doesn't care about the policy; they just want a "win" on deadline to show the base they did something.
It is about reducing the burdens of ocare, do you care more about constituents or preserving bho's "legacy". if latter then let ocare fail
Senator please support Sanders health care Bill
Can you talk to your fellow Ohio senator & convince him to save his constituents?
And for causing them pain and death after losing their insurance.  It's nothing short of endangering lives.
Keep up the good work Senator!
Prediction
'17- #GrahamCassidy sends med coverage to the states
'18-Rep. Senate zeroes funding
'19-Reps. blame "failed governors"
People die
Sen Portman will support the bill because he's cowardly man who hates poor people.  He needs conversation therapy to Christian values.
I'm going to start using this as a metaphor. "it was a regular GrahamCassidy shitshow."
You go to the refrigerator at work --your lunch is missing: "I've just been GrahamCassidied!!"
Someone breaks up with you: "I've just been GrahamCassidied!!!"
Please talk to @senrobportman about this. Maybe @JohnKasich can help convince him.
Continued racist posturing/ call it what it is.. regressed, devolved heartless .. no thing wrong with care for all.. Rep the people !
Push for single player please
#GrahamCassidyِ and the You're Going to Die Kid.  #ACASavesLives
What can I do to help? I am a cancer survivor/activist but I have so many peeps I love who will die with the repeal.
Yea so u alright makin the american people pay into private insurance  companies or be fined. why the government adds money to hold them up
Thank you for standing up for our right to #healthcare @SenSherrodBrown - Ohioans need you now more than ever!
Or 'subjugation of the 99%'
Anyway you can get Portman to vote no? Huh huh huh?? 
@Lee_in_Iowa With the Russian sword hanging over Trump's head. GOP figures this may be their only chance at a tax cut.
Every GOP plan is nothing more than that. We need a strong bi-partisan reform of ACA, not another desperate GOP plan
Thank you! Med Mutual did  job with covering pre-existing. Can u offer Fed $ to cover that group again?
And it will pass. People will die. @GOP doesn't care about anything except lining their pockets and being hypocrites.
Like the 'Affordable' Care Act?
I am disappointed that YOU block #singlepayer and therefore doom 28  million people uninsured and millions more underinsured by the ACA.
Just another Republican trying to kill families
No matter how they name it, we won't be fooled by a bunch of fools!
As a self proclaimed progressive, It's curious you haven't thought jumped on the #Medicare4All train yet, Senator. What's up with that?
Thank you for opposing any and every attempt at ACA Repeal!
How
We are SO tired of fighting for our lives...against our OWN government. Please help us. #GrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidyBill #grahmcassidyNO
Please don't watch sens vote YES, then go play golf or party w them later.Please show them it's not just politics. It's heart.#GrahamCassidy
Affordable health care is a oxymoron
Better tell that weasel Portman that!!!!!
Keep fighting the good fight for your constituents. It's appreciated. #NOonGrahamCassidy
And the status quo is non sustainable.
Can you stop it?? Please??

Watch this Dad say what every other American is feeling. Stop trying to take our healthcare away & start helping us! 
Liar...just like Nancy Pelosi
Thank you!
no one who votes for this bill should ever be able to label themselves "pro-life"
I'm glad we have you on our side.
Talk to Portman and explain it to him. Thank you.
Call your Senator 855-976-0757 call your house rep. 844-514-7166 numbers good for all USA
I thought it was to give money to states to deal with their state needs.  It means you have to do your job
@senrobportman @PatTiberi What say you? Yet another simple question. (that you will not answer)
Should use the Federal Employee system to insure everyone with more competition and consumer freedom.
Hopefully the Dems can work to block!
Could you have a convo with @senrobportman ???
This Ohioan thanks you for working so hard against this!  @senrobportman will you do the same?
Spoiler Alert: he won't.
"If you like your plan, you can keep your plan," ACA promised, while kicking millions of people off their plans.
I hope you're working hard to convince your Republican colleagues of the same.
Yes, yes, it is. #HealthForAll should be the Dem mantra. That is, if we survive #Trump and his stupid, stupid speeches!
If you don't support #MedicareForAll you are just as bad Senator
Calm down Sherrod. Trump will have the answers you need. Don't believe me? Just ask @JKraus4USsenate . I know he agrees with me!!
Neither you nor the twit know as Sherrod have any answers.  I'm surprised Brown can even get out of bed. That is one sickly looking human

I hope you can convince @senrobportman of this.
I called him twice today. @senrobportman only listens if it touches him personally. See:marriage equality. He lacks human empathy otherwise
How does that POS get reelected?
Please don't let them do it! Please.  #SaveACA.  #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
If states get diminishing block grants they will have to resort to #HealthCareRationing using #DeathPanels
Rather than engaging in hyperbole as your priority like a partisan why not give substantive reasons or links to help those you represent
The only people that ever caused anyone to lose their health insurance were the democrats that passed the ACA. Ever.
Please Senator, do whatever you can to run out the clock!
Lets just be clear the GOP doesn't give a DAMN about people and their insurance they want entitlement reform no matter what the cost
Need our taxes so they can give tax cuts to big donors! States are not going to get funding to match need.
Not all of the people in your district share this view
The majority if his constituents do share the same view with regards to healthcare.

Never going to please all.
Please do something..I hv called and emailed 14 R senator's...do you all even listen to, or get reports of calls and emails?

Please fight this, and fight hard Sen. Brown
#GrahamCassidy is a form of institutionalized murder. @LindseyGrahamSC What are you thinking?
They're thinking "f'k Americans", we need our #KochBucks contributions.
Thank you senator.
