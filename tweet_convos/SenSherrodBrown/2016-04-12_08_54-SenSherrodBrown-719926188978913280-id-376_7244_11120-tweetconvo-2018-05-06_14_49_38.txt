@WhiteHouse @LaurenJauregui @POTUS it should definitely be equal. It always should've been. We deserve it. We work our ass off #EqualPayDay
@dinahjauregxi  @LaurenJauregui @POTUS  You don't get STEM degrees,  and your always taking maternity leave.  #EqualPayDay #myth
@Isa268100001 @LaurenJauregui @POTUS maternity leave? I'm 17, in full time education, single and gay lmao. I work as a cleaner after school
@dinahjauregxi @Isa268100001 @LaurenJauregui @POTUS so how much less per hour do you get paid than your male coworkers?
@schley_guy @Isa268100001 @LaurenJauregui @POTUS I'm lucky because my school are fair and I get equal pay, but not everywhere is equal
@dinahjauregxi show me one place that pays women less for the same job.  This #EqualPayDay #myth is based on LIFETIME earnings, dumb bitch.
@Isa268100001 call me a dumb bitch when you're actually correct next time :)
@dinahjauregxi ok first pic.  Men work 27% harder and longer therefore get paid 27% more.
Just because you (@WhiteHouse @POTUS ) keep repeating it doesn't make it real. If women were cheaper than men no one would hire men!
@bashpr0mpt @WhiteHouse @POTUS they typically are, but men still get hired more often, how do you explain that?
@MoonHarvest1 @bashpr0mpt @WhiteHouse @POTUS well it explains that the gap is fake.
@schley_guy @MoonHarvest1 I was addressing that @WhiteHouse @POTUS are repeating a debunked lie / misinfo that's been thoroughly exposed.
@bashpr0mpt @MoonHarvest1 @WhiteHouse @POTUS well in politics if you repeat a lie enough it becomes truth. Sadly.
@WhiteHouse @LaurenJauregui @POTUS it almost sounds stupid how this isn't a thing already
@dimplesregui @WhiteHouse @LaurenJauregui @POTUS equal pay is a thing. And has been for 40 years.

@RealEmmaGoldman @POTUS thank goodness that this is already the case! Human rights tribunal in RARE cases it's not
@scooterjudy @POTUS And jobs that are historically held by #women should not be devalued in our economy.
@WhiteHouse the Koran is evil and so are all Muslims - haters will never coexist with Christians-they should all live on other side of earth

@WhiteHouse @patagonia @POTUS it has been since the law was passed in the 70's morons
@Sportsaholic27 Thanks for your feedback.

@WhiteHouse @TheEllenShow @POTUS Yes equal pay for equal work.....shame still debating it -21st century- yet not implementing it!
@WhiteHouse @TheEllenShow @POTUS agree with you Sir
@WhiteHouse @POTUS people just want to be paid for just showing up and not doing any work. WORRK is the operative word.
@WhiteHouse @LaurenJauregui @POTUS my humble opinion is -presidents aren't taken seriously like they used to be.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS I support that idea sir, and you are right about immigration the twelve tribes are here sir! Thank you! Awesome!
@WhiteHouse Equal pay should be a top priority.
@WhiteHouse @LaurenJauregui @POTUS YESSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
@WhiteHouse @ouyangmx @POTUS It already is

@WhiteHouse @POTUS Women don't have equal status w/men. An Article V amendment of Article II. Section 1. "He shall hold his Office...." reqd
@WhiteHouse @POTUS too bad it can't be retroactive
@WhiteHouse @POTUS it is ILLEGAL to pay women less. They EARN less because they dont work the same hours. Who pays women less? Be specific
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Mcdonald emoyees should get 50$ hour. More just.
