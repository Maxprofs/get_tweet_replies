Have you ever posted a comment like this concerning Democrats? "Democrats undercut coal miners" for example.
Democrats are frank. Coal-mining is moribund due to market forces, advances in technology in oil and gas. @allinwithchris
Arbitrary government regulations are not market forces.
Coal miners are suffering from deadly black lung disease in numbers more than 10x reported https://n.pr/2hG2Tr9  #coal
Did you even read the link? The "reported" number is meaningless.
Of course I read what I link in my Tweets. Did you get the point? Human & health costs of coal mining should be factored-in
The workers don't follow existing safety precautions b/c they fear losing their jobs due to the oversupply of unskilled labor
Why is there an oversupply if unskilled labor that drives down wages and encourages risk taking among workers? #HumanCost
#GeneralFlynn is a hypocritical lying jingoistic alt right puppet
what about the treason and espionage when Russia hack the DNC in July what about that
thanks GOP. Can't wait for 2018. Let the clean up begin DEM style
. Same old Republican party. They sure figured out how to get the peoples votes...sort of...Electoral College pay attn
in case any Trump voters didn’t notice, all Trump policies and appointments so far favor capital and not labor.
A lot of union folks from the rust belt who voted for Trump are about to get steamrolled.
Guess you are going to skip Iowa speech last night when DT said "Buy American"
@SenSherrodBrown @MSNBC I thought GOP was all about "America First!"
When do you think average Americans will start noticing Republicans are a bunch of baldfaced liars.? Just sayin
BUY AMERICAN isTHE subject to wake up working class& union Trump support.Stay on this, HELP USA& Dem's
Hey, remember when Walmart only sold American made goods. Seems a long time ago
@ecclesias @MSNBC both Trump fails workers with "Buy American" by not speaking out and Ryan drops landuage from Bill.
Hay Steal Workers That Voted For Trump & The GOP You Were Conned & Lied To. Now Your Screwed & No One Can Help You!
PAY- BACKS R A BITCH TRUMPKINS ARENT THEY??
you can't force individuals and businesses to make efficient cost choices. if so that would be communist...
@DavidOAtkins @MSNBC roflmao. Will be so sad when white men in heartland get fucked same way women and POC got fucked.
@SenSherrodBrown <-- help us survive the next 4 years

@_BVM @MSNBC How the hell can anyone even watch or take msnbc and cnn seriously after wikileaks exposed them?
#GOP #Trump #Economic #Fascism = privitize profit for 1% while socializing losses to 99%. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_of_fascism …
@puppymnkey @MSNBC Can they PLEASE call it what it is" THE nana nana boo boo GLOAT TOUR"
yes but will their alternate reality fake news GOP voters believe it or blame Hillary / Obama.
Do we have to be subjected to every one of these ego tours? Screams the same lies.
@NoGOPNo but all the white guys voted for Trump.  Hard to understand the willful lack of self preservation
such a fool
~ @SpeakerRyan IS A TRAITOR AND HAS TO GO ~
Jeez
.@allinwithchris BUY AMERICAN! http://www.cafepress.com/sunshinecollage.2020162792 …
Trump is a hypocrite. he uses foreign materials for his steel & iron.
Good leaders lead by example. NOT TRUMP
and you expected?
@wendydavis @MSNBC @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan Americans KNOW GOP does not care @ work. men/women #ActionsMatter #SRS VOTE
They cant buy american steel because its too expensive. Raise tax to make up the difference. So more jobs or higher tax?
.@allinwithchris @jensuths @MSNBC Good going Trumpers. You got totally scammed.
Hey Pennsylvania; you want to rethink your vote now? Looks like he's not bringing your jobs back. Shocked. 
Are they giving a reason for taking it out?
@RolandSMartin1    pay attention  America
@Maggyw519 Thanks for posting this. I posted the @dcexaminer article so my conservative friends can't accuse me of bias.
Trump lies about everything
@realDonaldTrump What happened to "Make AMERICA" great again? Just another lie from the con artist-elect.
#Trump blew his1st test,he didn't lift a finger to keep"Buy American" materials for US water & sewer projects
@SenSherrodBrown @MSNBC I feel like I'm watching a slow coup.
So hold the bill until Trump is in? What else is in bill that Obama would not want to veto? Not enough Information.
Trump base will now hopefully realize how their President elect has zero class and credibility...
They don't care about class! It's only ever been about white nationalism disguised as economic insecurity
BUY AMERICAN provision is the subject to challenge Trump and GOP. Stay on this. Like Rachel on Flint
We can't focus on Sherrod with Trump wavng his arms alongside. What purposes does it serve to show it? PLEASE, PLEASE STOP.
I didn't watch  your show last night. I refuse to normalize this man. A split screen of a narcissist saying NOTHING.
@wendydavis Trump and GOP screws American workers and refuse American Iron & steel.??
@barbaraJean1980 Water bill stripped Buy American
@WendySunshine1
That's amazing, @allinwithchris actually covered a story relevant to American job losses. Too bad it's 35yrs too late
@wendydavis @MSNBC  https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10154789502447128&id=87777747127 …
So, business as usual.  To those of you who thought you got something radically different...yaaawwwnnn.

US STEEL COULD REHIRE 10,000 AFTER TRUMP WIN... http://drudge.tw/2gWUHkX 
@DavidJardine7 @MSNBC Republicans against plot against working Americans & have for years It's shameful #GOPCorruption
@JoyAnnReid Repubs never fail to disappoint. If only their constituents would wake up and see them for what they are
NOBODY, GIVES, A, FUCK. NO ONE...
OF COURSE NOT.. TRUMP SUPPORTERS DON'T EVEN GIVE A FUCK ABOUT BEING BAMBOOZLED BY TRUMP THEY JUST LOVE HIS XENOPHOBIC ATTITUDE
And those same legislatiors will tell you they are patriotic. Patronizing to citizens, for sale to corps.
Is this how DJT thinks "we" can "make America great again" by killing American Steel?
@JoyAnnReid All union workers need to hear this!
Why do you keep airing DonaldTrump 24/7.  Don't put him on the same screen with SenSherrodBrown.
@realDonaldTrump - too busy tooting
@JoyAnnReid Nothing to see.  That's  what chant when this comes on.
@allanbrauer @MSNBC If FOX News doesn't tell them, they won't know. And would they even care? I don't think so.
All together we see your true colors shining thru.SMH.They still won't get it.We're liars,Trump cares for them
@JoyAnnReid @MSNBC GOP doesn't care about the middle class workers.
#liarliarpantsonfire DJT  &
Speaker  Ryan
Where is @realDonaldTrump to save these jobs ??
all fracking,oil plunder,pipelines to export it overseas so they can make their sh** over there cheap and push it back on us
U wonder why I have this DEEPHATRED of un-American republican politicians? Their core values SO DIFFERENT from mine!
@AFLCIO @MSNBC 

AmerIcans Buyin only foreign Goods provision, allows us to get everybody's good & just grow the $booty Here
REPUBLICANS ARE THIEVES AND OBSTRUCTIONISTS,  WHEN WILL PEOPLE LEARN ?.
Wish he'd stop by the men's penitentiary and stay there.
Paul Ryan takes "Made in America" out of legislation for new water & sewer projects, and Trump wouldn't help. WHAT???
Trump illegally imported Chinese steel. So much for 35% tariff.
Whatever happened to the findings that Trump purchased Chinese steel?
@JoyAnnReid How can @SpeakerRyan & @realDonaldTrump say they care about #AmericanJobs & not support this. #Ohio take notice!
Remember when all the homes in Florida was deem no good because of China installation.
@JoyAnnReid @MSNBC it happened under Obama so next year Trump can get credit for undoing it.
Keep pumping that information  Chris.  You, Rachel, Lawrence and Joy are best informationalist.
THANKS for getting the word out that it is DEMS WHO ARE TRYING TO SAVE AMERICAN JOBS.  GOP has lied. JUST WANT CUTS & $$$$
Trump and the GOP are bringing back steel, it's just not American steel.
- Trump buys China's steel!
How do steel workers control what happens to them when Ryan deletes provision to buy American steel without consulting them

. Wow these are the jobs comming back. Making America Great Again.  Good job fellas.
Ryan removed requirement to use American steel on infastructure jobs Trump concured- American jobs?
Okay, who is behind this, as Donny isn't, he doesn't have this depth of cunning.
so sad they feel so entitled they can pick and choose what US workers they help!
@JoyAnnReid @MSNBC How U like that, rust belt DRUMPF supporter's. OMG  Y'all being PUNKED like I've not seen B4
The man was buying Steel from China- now the burr under the saddle is gone-Americans are Screwed
too bad the unions aren't being more vocal. I guess they're scared & still remember PATCO.
Hey Trump voters! No more using US steel. Costs too much. Gonna be a very long & painful 4 years.
#LyingFraudTrump #LyingFraud @GOP
This is the same person that the Nevada gaming commission won't give a gambling license to!
@JoyAnnReid @MSNBC To the readers,"Bury MyHeart At Wounded Knee " by Dee Brown.Steel workers,unions need to stand
oh yeah @GOP are sooi for the working class..uhuh and ill fart magical flying reindeer out of my butt
@jtkirklin @allinwithchris @MSNBC @GOP 

You talking about Gen Flynn or Sessions...?
Pixie ears out yer ass lil guys...
the @GOP undermining American Steel, likely pushed by Trump so he can use more chinese garbage
Chinese steel is probably better but...by virtue of fact that Trump buys is BULLSHIT
actually no chinese recycle scrap steel and don't refine it properly weakens it and rusts
@JoyAnnReid @MSNBC A little bit .
American steel workers undercut American consumers and taxpayers, forcing them to pay inflated prices.
He probably has no stock so it's irrelevant to him
so who is making them explain what they did?
Ha! Trump came to Pittsburgh, among other cities, & said "we're bringing back coal, we're bringing back steel." Right
Ha. Coal is used to make steel. What a quandary.
How patriotic. Republicans sucker punch American steel workers, scrapping "Buy America" provision:
The beauty of this screw job is no one cares until they have no work no food
#BendOverAmerica
Preach ! That is coming sooner than we all know but noone listening! sooo Sad
@SenSherrodBrown senator you came out in opposition on day 1 against him and now you cry wolf. Sad!
@leokiminardo @jeremiahcha1997
@SenSherrodBrown why didn't u call him?  Doesn't seem like Gore, Emmanuel, Heitkamp, Manchin have any issue with meetings.
