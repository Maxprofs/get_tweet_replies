ur not with the Ohio people u gave the banks all that money not one loan paid off. So u let them skate.
like u did corporation that left this country
why the Democratic coffers filled with cash. A billion on a presidential election. And lose . Lol
elections have consequences.
They're having a meltdown!!

What happens now that they've changed the rules? How do we stop them?
It's a whole new world where the rules get changed when they don't suit someone's needs. It's like #ToddlerLand
It's completely ridiculous! I'm blown away. Proud of those standing up against it but sad it even needs to happen.
I'm an Ohioan and proud of Sen Brown & #Cincinnati for standing up for the morals of the America I was born in.
Agreed! I wish I could say the same about Portman. But I'm also not surprised by him either.
How is Portman confused about #Cincinnati #SanctuaryCity announcement? We've been quietly there for 2 years!
I don't even know...
barry was a pimp but the gop did their job, why can't you?  communists are perpetual liars and thugs.
lol--go and cry in your bathroom as th epeople dont want to listen to your whinning
Typical Dem failure. It's time for a change in our party. #OHNASTYWOMEN
thank you Sen. Brown!
not there to vote 2 bad- do u have written note from your doc? That's what I need 2 not b @ work
Time will be on the side of those that oppose the trump regime of power hungry faux leaders like Hatch.
you are NOT standing with the people from Ohio.  Shame on you. We voted for trump!
I sure as hell didn't vote for Trump
Well children he's the POTUS and that's that. Time to grow up. #Democracy
.  Hi hitler , yes sir , hi hitler
U can say all u like about him or otherwise but at the end of the day & after all the sniveling & whining....he's ur POTUS
Thank you, Senator Brown. We have your back! Please continue to stand up for the American people!
& now GOP changes rules to vote w/out Dems. GOP dismantling our Democracy. I fear for our nation
Rural Ohio doesn't like all the boycotting, hatred, and lack of appointments, absences of Democrats. Dems lost,pure&simple
Thank you Senator!  You will be rewarded with the loyal votes of the millions of brave Ohioans you represent
don't think so!
Voter turn out will be HIGH in 2018. What do you think is more likely, that people who stayed home in 2016 are Dem or Rep?
could be. However, there is a difference between "obstruction" and objection on sound, well-articulated grounds.
the man is shamless
show real leadership heal this country! Go to work dissent, vote, and get on with the peoples work!
B S. Get back to work & do your jobs. We The People are paying you to do your jobs. Not to cower in halls
@SenSchumer @SenateFinance & creating & promoting divide & discord... It's what you do. Are we paying you to work or what??
do you job and listen to nominee
This Ohioan opposed to your obstruction.Voters have spoken 80 of 88 counties voted for Trump.
Off throwing a fit and keeping our President from having the team needed to work for the people
@SenSchumer @SenateFinance  Ha, what a joke! You 'standup' by not 'showing up'! Wow! New concept of doing your job!
very very immature and disrespectful to those of us who good the bill!
Top 7 partisan leaders in the house. Please confront this issue. Hoyer McCarthy Trent Russell Hensarling Duncan Loudermilk
wow don't support a guy your party wrote checks for . What gives u don't control them anymore
I support the Dems action today. I'm proud to be your constituent!  #Fightback
and the despicable repubs made step one to kill democracy
Thank you!
Yeah, but it didn't work. Playing hooky is NOT resistance; "The bad GOP tricked us again" is a weak excuse.
You're a good man, Sen. Brown, but when will you challenge fellow Democrats to grow a backbone and fight?
@SenSchumer @SenateFinance I would have done this at work I would have been fired.
just more evidence of Democrats not doing their job. These antics are so childish.
Holding a REAL JOB should be a requirement b4 entering Congress. We'll talk with your state
I am so disgusted by this action by Republicans and @senrobportman. Remember 2008?
No there are getting paid by the American people and they arenot doing their jobs. #MAGA
: That's why Party is in trouble. No guts, no fight!
they are not standing for the people of Ohio. This state voted for Pres. Trump. Did you forget that?
You did Ohio Proud!  Stand strong. We are with you.
Thanks
Thank you Senator Brown!
remember this >>

@SenSchumer caused IndyMac Bank Failure
Good! Thank you!
democrats are beginning to piss me off
#DisTrumpia demands unprecedented Dem fortitude.
dems have no forward direction. All sitting at home on our dime .  Forget your re -election
Give 'em hell, Senator Brown. A bought senator is a bought senator & betrayer of voters.
Great! Now keep your eyes on the world because trump is banking on you missing what is happening Ukraine.
Not at work for sure.  I only hope that this picture stands out in the minds of voters at election time.
your toast Brown!!
re-scribbling  history covering Dems tracks Keep looking backward over Dem donkey's ass
We will #MAGA  @SenateFinance
I guess the hearing ended sooner then. Good to see you've embraced efficient government.
I love it! Keep it up!
That would be the CRA and forcing banks to give loans to people who had no hope of repaying it.
Good for you!
WTG, Dems! We're with you all the way!
@SenSchumer @SenateFinance Thank you! It will ALL be on them..they broke it...they bought it..& we will never let them 4get
@SenSchumer @SenateFinance Enjoy your last term. You're betraying Ohio voters, trust me, I'm one of them. #Shameful
Thank you, now give the SCOTUS in exchange for a no on Sessions
Thank you! U give me hope.
You do not represent the poor, the rusted, the no jobs area of Ohio I live in...  Drive South Sherrod
Good for you!  the hypocrisy on the right is staggering!  this will be amo for the fight ahead!
2018 is JUST around the corner
Hatch has always been a partisan devoid of principle.  The last republican I voted for was Bob Dole.
Brown, U abdicated your responsibility as the opposition galvanizing your core

Independents? Not so much
I am a voter from Ohio. Please do your job. You do not represent me or my fellow Buckeyes from the hallway.
@JustWhatNowWhy @SenateFinance #StopPresidentBannon
how is this not illegal #youremployer demands an answer
This will payout in the end.  We are #TheMajority and we stand against Prez Bannon.  #NoBanNoWall #resist
More like sleeping late after protesting. Ignoring their work in Congress.
funny... based on the last election you are NOT standing w/ us. You are playing more of your divisive games
that didn't work out to well for you did it? You are further damaging the Democratic Party and have no clue.
Shameful and juvenile. This is why I voted for Trump. You are proving that the swamp needs to be drained. Do your job.
YES
So your ok with the previous FED manipulation of Rates
Thank you Senator Brown. This is what leadership looks like.
That's fine but how did your "yes" vote on four other Trump nominees improve things in Ohio?
@SenSchumer @SenateFinance born and raised in Ohio the government there is so pathetic that's what happened
Aren't you up for re election in  2018?
Dems just keep losing in disarray,2018 brings super majority,will really have empty seats then
You Guys got outfoxed again.  I am ashamed! No vote for SCOUS nominee for 12 mo. OK for Repubs.
Why is it the GOP makes these power grabs and when the Dems are in control they don't ??
@Rosie @SenateFinance did u forget your state voted for Trump!  Time to vote u out next time
Thank You ! U must stand up to the bully GOP and NEVER SURRENDER.We Libs no longer will put up with wimps.
It's an admin. that has forced the childish out of touch left to grow up or get out. Adults in charge now
Keep it up, and we freedom loving Ohioans will finally be rid of you next year. Also, Mnunchin is a Democrat
@SenSchumer @SenateFinance Do your job-go to work like the rest of us.I would love to stay home when things get difficult.
Senators we r putting you on notice!  You will be voted OUT!! 202-224-3121

Thank you, Senator.
stand tall for Ohio!!
standing with? Kinda looks like you abandoned your post.
Good move @SenSherrodBrown - your #GOP @SenateFinance friends seem to be lacking in similar principles.
Thank you! 
They really SHOULD BE looking for jobs.
This is really ugly.  These noms- it wasn't 0 votes. The Dems weren't even in the room. #FIGHTEVERYTHING

Please continue to fight.  Thank you.
senator, can you explain why you voted yes on 4/5 potus nominees? Disappointing you didn't vote w/values
Out in corridor pouting! Not enough backbone to participate in Constitutional duty!  Grow up!
Where were you when Dems used Mack and May mortgage fraud?
@jcbdraco @SenateFinance you mean, not doing their jobs and gallivanting. That's why they keep losing.
Thank you for your stance in the Senate. We need more like minded Dems now more than ever.
@OnlyRayMisner @SenateFinance 
thank you!
#WeThePeople WILL remember your acquiescence to tyranny

GOP changes rules to approve Trump cabinet nominees without Dems http://hill.cm/9LdN8to  
I want 2 be represented as a tax payer- get back to those Committee's and vote- even if its no.
Folks, if all the rules are suspended, where does that leave us?
not the majority if people! MAGA!
thank you!!!
Disgraceful!!! Do the jobs that you were elected to do!!!!

GOP @SenateFinance became Bannon fascists! Backing both corrupt big $ guys who LIED 2 them! These GOP Sens gone 2018/2020
NOW they want to stand up to banks after they gutted the middle class of THEIR WATCH #HubrisSqd
So you are playing hooky today? Not a very good look for someone running for reelection.
