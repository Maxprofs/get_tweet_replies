If senators canâ€™t answer tough questions about their healthcare bill, they should change the bill, not restrict reporters.
Maybe they should just keep it secret and tell people they can read it after they pass it. Sound familar. Resign if you dont want to work.
Keep talking! Thank you
Hello LINDA
Amazing that Trump is trying to completely destroy our press
What is really amazing is that Trump is destroying the country.
Amazing? He basically said he would when he was running for Pres. Ppl need to stop thinking he will ever do normal things. He loves chaos...
Mostly he loves himself above all others
This describes a classic case of a narcissistic sociopath enamored with power & disregards America's core values in favor of self interests.
I could not have said it better!
Thank you. I'm very concerned for our country's sanity. This negativity is not good. Praying for swift reforms starting with Trump's exit.
Way to go, SHERROD!!!  Let the sun shine in.
Now he is destroying himself perfect 
I love it.
Where's today's  statement on today's shooting at the baseball field?
Keep up the good work Senator Brown!!
You go Senator !!!!  You are Ohio's Best.
Yes! Thank you Senator Brown!
Speak!
From the Senator who blocks members of #15th when they ask why you put illegal aliens before citizens.
Proud to call you MY Senator!
Thank you so much Sen Brown! I respect you immensely! Thanks for fighting for us & our democracy! Show traitorous @GOP how it's done!
Thank you, sir. I am grateful for your representation. 43206
You're my hero ...& the only reason I don't hyperventilate daily over the news. #journalism
Thank you Senator Brown!
You are one senator who would be asked no questions.
People should be able to question you guys anywhere!!  even though you usually dont answer!!
Thanks again

I think reporters should just film them and make "bad lip reading" clips.
You are a hero! Thank you for standing up for our constitution and the free press. You are a bright light in the midst of darkness.
Thank you, I'm proud that you're my Senator.
You  rock Sherrod Brown!!!
Go Sherrod.  They have so much to hide when in GOP
Thank you Senator Brown, for standing up for our democracy and protecting our constitutional rights!
Thank you Senator for upholding the first amendment!
Do it!!
God knows how awful the world would be if everybody had to follow rules that were set by (wait for it) 'A Rules Committee' #Classless
is that @HallieJackson?
Unless you're on your way to the crapper. And the less we hear from lifers like you the better. Get some courage and push for terms limits.
Free the Free Press!!
yes! Thank you!
Thank you!
Good grief! Restrict press access and then call them the fake media. This is NOT democratic.
Proud to have you as my senator and that you stand up for what is right!  Thank you for what you do for Ohioans and all Americans!
Would  like to see a self ban  by MSN for  3 days of all things Trump & Congress. Then see what they all would  do.
Thank you!! Proud you are my Senator.
Glad at least one of our senators is standing up for Ohio while @senrobportman is drafting the GOP bill in secret. Let's have hearings!
Thanks Senator Brown!  You are the best.
Outstanding!
good for you! thanks!
Thank you! @CoryBooker @SenatorMenendez I expect no less
I'm an unrepresented DC voter who feels you've got my back.  Give 'em hell.
Why aren't all Dems out there giving interviews?
Thank you, @SenSherrodBrown
Thank you Senator Brown!
And not a single ATM in sight! #resist #FreedomOfThePress #OpenGovernment
Bravo Senator!  Thank you for representing our true Republic!
Thank you!
Good for you, Senator Brown!
COWARDS.

Senate has been weighed. Senate has been measured. Senate has been found wanting.

We, the People, will hold you ACCOUNTABLE!
Thank you Senator!
You rock!
DRAG THEM!!!!! Good on you Senator!!!
Thank you senator. @senrobportman Neither you not your office has commented yet. Thoughts?
I called Senator Portman's office. They knew nothing about this.
Exactly! Because @SenSherrodBrown is the only Ohio Senator left with a spine!
Go Sherrod go! You represent the will of the people. Ohio is proud to call you ours!
I would hope all Democrats would follow your leadership
Thank you, Senator Brown.
And for that bit of Americanism, you got a new follower! Please try to contain your excitement -- and thank you for this.
Thanks Senator! Please make site nothing gets through the Senate until we see the health care bill!
I am a RN. Imagine for a moment that I could tell a patient's family, "Sorry, I'm not answering questions!" And I'm not even elected!!!
Thank you for respecting the Constitution
Thank you! There are far too many elected officials unwilling to answer questions these days. Are they hiding something? Ashamed?
So you advocate breaking rules?  No wonder we have so many investigations and nothing getting done.
You have all the answers on what's right and wrong? Better for you to make these decisions as opposed to the senator? Utilizing what basis?
more dem senators should use the opportunity to get their word out
The press needs to ignore this unconstitutional assault on free speech. #ACLU will gladly fight #GOP censorship #resist
Those are MY HALLWAYS!!!! Those are OUR REPRESENTATIVES!! The only thing I'm not paying for is YOU! You're good.
Thank you, Senator! We rely on reporters to see, hear, and speak for us and we need people like you to stand up for our rights!
What do you think about withholding consent....? What you don't oppose, you endorse! #TrumpCare #2018
Thank you, Senator, for standing up for a free press, openness, and transparency.

Use #resistbot to find, format & fax your msgs to congress. Text 'resist' to 50409.
Thank you Senator! Appreciate your leadership while @SenateMajLdr abandons all sense of American values.
Yay @SenSherrodBrown!
Thank you Sen Brown!  All Dem Senators should be out giving interviews!
Proud to call you my senator.
Thank you @SenSherrodBrown.
Thank you sir...now about the other 47 senators...
I've not read the new guidance nor researched it's basis, but wouldn't senators have a speech right to ignore restrictions?
Thank you!!!
Democracy dies in the darkness! Shine a light Sherrod!
If you want to use 'Shine-a-light Sherrod' as a 2020 presidential campaign slogan, feel free.
Can't lose sight of 2018. Let's get him re-elected to the Senate, first!
Your awesome Sherrod Brown, and proud to have you as an Ohio senator. Oh, and I was not bribed or made to say that.
Do you approve this message? 
Democracy requires participation. We count on the press to be our ears and eyes. Senate must remember they represent the people.
Right on @SenSherrodBrown!
Thanks for doing your job for the people!
@SenKamalaHarris @SenFranken @RepJerryNadler @CoryBooker any chance you all could call in the press & answer #Trumpcare questions on camera?
Badass!!
