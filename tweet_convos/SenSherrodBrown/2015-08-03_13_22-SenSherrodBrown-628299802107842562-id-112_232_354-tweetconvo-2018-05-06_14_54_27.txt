Senator, no disrespect but those same men and women would still have access to care w/out ties to abortion. #DefundPP @SenSherrodBrown
@PolitiBunny @SenSherrodBrown Senator, your comments hold absolutely no water. We all know those services are covered elsewhere.
@jhewitt1280 @SenSherrodBrown And I'd the senator read the bill he's have known the money would go to real health clinics.
@SenSherrodBrown county board of Health provides the same Health Checks. Send the money to them and #DefundPP
@AndChristenson @SenSherrodBrown Summit County Board of Health's website does not say it provides contraception, which prevents abortion.
@LutraWinterSky @SenSherrodBrown as long as Summit County Health Department is a Title X provider it has to provide contraception services.
@AndChristenson @SenSherrodBrown It appears that Stark county has the nearest non PP location that receives Title X.
@SenSherrodBrown   They have not provided one mammogram.  Let's give the money to other providers for women's health issues.
@SenSherrodBrown you can put your head in the sand. it's still butchery
@SenSherrodBrown Defending the murder of children in the womb is exceedingly wicked, and you know it very well.
@SenSherrodBrown You support dissecting baby eyes, legs and whole "cadavers? For profit?You support corrupt accounting?! Gruesome!
@SenSherrodBrown What sort of society allows @PPFA to kill children, sell their body parts, and you, sir call that “healthcare?” #DefundPP
@SenSherrodBrown Selling Baby parts is not healthcare.  Not a choice. Look at the videos and say these aren't babies
@SenSherrodBrown that money could go to actual healthcare

@SenSherrodBrown You are disgusting! Any health services besides abortion can be done at a local health clinic. #thankgodforkasich
@LastChance2016 @SenSherrodBrown And what if PP is the only local clinic for miles? Not everyone lives in a big city, or has easy transport.
@MewMew34 @SenSherrodBrown There is always a dr or an urgent care. PP is predominantly in urban areas. BTW, I grew up in a town of 800 ppl
@LastChance2016 @MewMew34 @SenSherrodBrown When I had no insurance, PP were the only ones who would help me. Dr's offices would not see me.
@LutraWinterSky @MewMew34 @SenSherrodBrown I'm not against the concept, I'm against the brutality.PP fed. funds should go to help ppl like u
@SenSherrodBrown Some of those dissected babies were "special needs children" some African-American Jewish Nuremberg again!
@SenSherrodBrown Respectfully, Sen. Brown, what #PlannedParenthood has become is not about "care" either for women or unborn children.
@Conservatveone Thanks for your retweet.
@SenSherrodBrown No wonder they refuse to watch the videos. They must worry they could be persuaded. http://liveactionnews.org/breaking-obama-admin-contracted-fetal-organ-supplier-tied-planned-parenthood/ …
With all due respect, there are multiple places (e.g. in Dayton) that provide the same services. Who are you kidding?
@SenSherrodBrown
@SenSherrodBrown I'm perfectly fine with people having access to PP.  I just don't want to be stuck with having to pay for it.
@SenSherrodBrown @SenateDems Liar, you defend their right mutilate babies.  How many late term abortions does PP sponsor?
@SenSherrodBrown shocking.
@SenSherrodBrown lost a voter here
@SenSherrodBrown PP is making war on women. Fund real healthcare for women.
@SenSherrodBrown I'm disappointed. Watch the unedited videos. Stand with the defenseless.
@SenSherrodBrown One day, you will stand before God. Try explaining to him that you were defending women's access to healthcare.
@SenSherrodBrown I won't be voting for you again next term then. Better free health care for women in Ohio cities than PP if you looked.
@SenSherrodBrown Nice vote, derp.
@SenSherrodBrown - a friend, 17 weeks pregnant, just called all PP locations in Columbus seeking prenatal care. She was told, we have none??
@SenSherrodBrown any comment?
@SenSherrodBrown shame on u for allowing young child to be SOLD for parts!
@SenSherrodBrown
Thank You @SenSherrodBrown ! So proud to be an Ohioan and have you as a senator. #StandwithPP
@Flyakight379 @SenSherrodBrown Planned parenthood has not provided one mammogram.  Other providers for women's health should get the money.
@SenSherrodBrown And the murder of viable infants to buy employees Lamborghinis
@SenSherrodBrown Sen Brown does NOT protect & serve ALL Ohioans. #unbornlivesmatter #prolifewevote
@SenSherrodBrown I am a woman and you are NOT on my side.
@SenSherrodBrown No! There are alternatives & you ALL full well know it. Your vote & stance are unconscionable!! What an embarrassment u r!
@SenSherrodBrown you don't give a shit about the people of Ohio. You care about their votes. #DefundPPOrGTFO of the Senate. #DefundPP
@SenSherrodBrown aaaaaand you receive campaign contributions from them.  Am I right?
@SenSherrodBrown that is fine, just don't use tax $ for the abortion part
.@SenSherrodBrown Intact Fetal Cadavers At 20-Weeks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egGUEvY7CEg … … #PPSellsBabyParts U NEED TO WATCH!
.@SenSherrodBrown Butchering dead babies for their parts is not a women’s health care issue. #PPSellsBabyParts. #WomenBetrayed, #DefundPP
@SenSherrodBrown you are a coward, no PP office has mammogram capability. They don't provide reliable contraceptive help according to worker
@SenSherrodBrown really?
@SenSherrodBrown no...not kidding..REALLY... It's the BIG LIE!! PP offers only death and suffering to woman & young girls.#AbortionIsMurder
@SenSherrodBrown YOU MEAN YOU DEFEND MURDER AND DISSECTING OF HUMANS! DIDN'T OCARE PROVIDE MILLIONS WITH HEALTHCARE, NO NEED FOR PP!!!!!!!!!
@SenSherrodBrown I thought obamacare was going to provide healthcare to everyone? If so, why do we need PP? #DefundPP
@SenSherrodBrown thank you for standing up for women
@SenSherrodBrown Why won't you defend the 50+ million lives that have been murdered through abortion? #DefundPP
@SenSherrodBrown -extremely disappointed. You talk of helping 1000's. The infanticide of PP is in the millions
@SenSherrodBrown @Will_J_Bryan Well, I'm worried re. "Standing with" a corporation. I mean, PP is partly bad. I get your point but ... !
@SenSherrodBrown and after you discount that number for abortions and contraceptives (available for free under ACA) what's left?
@SenSherrodBrown Please rethink your stance on defunding PP.  I do not want my tax dollars being used to fund murder.
@SenSherrodBrown Good job, Senator. There is an alarming difference between your efforts & the eternally near-sightedness across the aisle.
@SenSherrodBrown Even men?
You mean indirectly, by preventing spread/circulation of STDs to/among them by interrupting the epidemics?
@SenSherrodBrown Why do you consider babies second class citizens?
@SenSherrodBrown Great! When will you also defend babies equal rights?
@SenSherrodBrown What kind of health care does Planned Parenthood provide to babies?
@SenSherrodBrown So are you saying groups are more important than individuals?
@SenSherrodBrown Helping people is subjective, isn't it?  So where does the truth lie?
.@SenSherrodBrown Do you also support the ripping apart of babies & selling their organs? Shame on you! #PPSellsBabyParts
@SenSherrodBrown A rise by any other name is still a rose?
@SenSherrodBrown How am I helped by them if my girlfriend wants to abort my baby?  Why are her rights above mine or the babies?
@SenSherrodBrown Why can you look at an ultra sound and say that's not a human being?
@SenSherrodBrown Why are you for women rights and civil rights, but not babies rights?
@SenSherrodBrown So if someone does something good, does that trump them doing anything bad?  We done do that with others who break the law.
@SenSherrodBrown Why aren't babies protected under the constitution to Life, Liberty and Property?
@SenSherrodBrown Wheare babies rights equal to women's rights? Isn't this discrimination?
@SenSherrodBrown Time For Real Men Too Step Up & Step Toi The Side & Be There
@SenSherrodBrown @OHDems  @PPact And Too The Republican Party..This Too Shall Pass...YOU..As Men..What Effects Are Women.. EFFECTS US TOO
@SenSherrodBrown Can any of these Brown haters tell me how much they donate to the Clown Bus (GOP) or Koch Brothers?
.@TinkhamChuck Congratulations! Excellent use of Alinksy’s rule #5: “Ridicule is man’s most potent weapon”. Saul would have been proud.
@SenSherrodBrown Your speaking to under educated aliens (GOP).  All they know is what Rev. Billy Bob tells them at Indoctrination Classes 
@SenSherrodBrown Thank you for not giving into lies and fear mongering. As a poor university student, I would have been lost without PP.
@SenSherrodBrown Not all of your constituents do...
@SenSherrodBrown then get rid of their option to murder babies
.@SenSherrodBrown So you're A-OK with the sale of baby body parts?  Good to know.
@SenSherrodBrown #DefundPlannedParenthood. This is not a healthcare organization. I refuse to pay for butchering dead babies.
@SenSherrodBrown Thank you for supporting women's healthcare!
@SenSherrodBrown There's other places for them to get healthcare...you've lost my vote
@SenSherrodBrown #DefundPlannedParenthood abortion is not synonymous w/health care-Stand 4 women and against govt spt of selling baby parts
@SenSherrodBrown Proud you are our Senator. You represent us well in D.C.!
@SenSherrodBrown @SenateDems You left out Infanticide+profit margins..intentionly..of course! We know where you stand. Don't bother t\2 deny
@SenSherrodBrown please get your facts right Senator. If you truly stand for women's health, you would #DefundPP
@SenSherrodBrown @SenateDems  thank you.
@SenSherrodBrown @SenateDems start a new healthcare provider for women then. Because PP is disgusting. You should be ashamed sir.
@SenSherrodBrown @SenateDems Access won't be limited, just extended to real healthcare professionals.
.@SenSherrodBrown and @PPact thanks those 100K women for paying for their Lamborghinis
Can @SenSherrodBrown please tell us how much per year he donates to PP out of his own pocket?
@Carl_Stawicki @SenSherrodBrown or can he tell us how much @PPact donates to his & every other dems' campaign?
@SenSherrodBrown selling your soul for a few pieces of silver....#PPSellsBabyParts #DefundPlannedParenthood
@SenSherrodBrown @PPact you are missing the point.  Can you address the substance?
@SenSherrodBrown you obviously didn't read the bill or watch the videos. And you must really need those @PPact campaign contributions.
@SenSherrodBrown Thank you!
@SenSherrodBrown I support you sir!
@SenSherrodBrown @SenateDems ... You're on your own. #DefundPlannedParenthood
@SenSherrodBrown So you defend abortion and selling body parts?
@SenSherrodBrown Stop the attempted monopoly of Planned Parenthood, provide competition in healthcare. #DefundPP
@SenSherrodBrown so what you are saying is "Go Infanticide!" @SenateDems.  #DefundPP #StandwithPP
@SenSherrodBrown @SenateDems auschwitz provided healthcare too.
@ManBearPig486 @SenSherrodBrown @SenateDems You win tweet of the year!
@SenSherrodBrown Thanks 4 defending PP but why can't govt stay out of a womans body?
@SenSherrodBrown Thank you!
