Send Davidson article to Senate IC and Foreign Relations, and FBI. Garner support for investigation.
Thank you for investigating this. It sounds like a shady deal. Release the #TaxReturns @adamdavidson @maddow #Russiagate
thanks for making Ohio proud of you
and btw.. Maddow? Didn't she cry on election night? Yeah. She's unbiased.
@adamdavidson@maddow MADDOW may not LIKE DT but she reports the TRUTH. It didn't come from her ass! #CROOKEDPREZ
mainstream and TRUTH do not even belong in the same sentence.
Not even going to bother. Conspiracy theories are what DJT LeDOUCHE believes in. And unicorns! Lol #CLUELESSPPL!
I know, evidence is hard, especially when it's imaginary or implicates your own party.
We LOVE how everything the GOP does they turn it around and blame it on us, the decent, civilized population!!!!
lol lol lol
We have the best Senator in Congress doing great work #sherrodforpresident
We sure do. Rob Portman is his name!
Some many political hacks on one tweet!  Where was Sherri when clapper lied, IRS, foundation?
Where are checks & balances? Nothing is more important than getting that man out of office. All in harm's way.
thank you for looking into this. So much potential corruption with this horrifying administration.
Maddow and Brown....putz'!  My President is your President.Get over it and stop hating!Babies!
Wow. What a great rebuttal. I would suggest investigating for yourself. Lots to see
thx senator brown.we must get to the bottom of potus biz ties to Russia/illegal deals.hes nuts
How can he be nuts and prez? Like Reagen? Alzheimer's, dementia, maybe but not nuts! Greedy, arrogant, rude, crude, dude, yes!
so why vote for Wilbur Ross?  Why?  Why did you? #resist
thank you for seeing the storm on the horizon @SenSherrodBrown and supporting the media!
My children. Your children. All at real risk. Surely some Senators can be trusted with the well being of the USA?  Who?
Will this be investigated? Or will it be covered up?
Need to keep following the money and get #TrumpTaxReturns
Thx 4 investigating-kleptocracy's dirty/illegal dealings @SenFeinstein @KamalaHarris @RepAdamSchiff
Thank you for standing up for the truth. Ohio is proud.
Thank you!
Proud of you Senator. Proud to be an Ohioan! We seem to be the voice of sanity. And senSanders

TY, sirs & Rachel. I think the ltr you sent to WH re this is what caused DT's twitter rage TY!
did you investigate Obama?
Senator Sherrod Brown, you rock
Yes he is hard-headed and dumber than a box of rocks!
WHO **TRUMP?
When are you going to subpenoa Trump's taxes? He lied that he would provide them after the election.Not to mention lies about jobs, ins, etc
Excellent segment on TRMS 
Unless @realDonaldTrump can tell the public where he got the info, do not investigate.  #fakenews
LOCK THEM UP!
Thank you for looking into this it seems off. Can we see his taxes too. Thanks
thank you. At least one of our senators in Ohio is concerned.  @senrobportman #Trumprussia
That's correct Rob Portman is the only senator concerned!
Rachel Maddow ROCKS THE HOUSE. GO GIRL....
please look into this, also don't let them destroy health care. We know it needs work.
We need more than talk, but an execution of this independent investigation.
Keep Hammerin' Away Sen Brown!!   Great Work!
Thank you Senator Brown, keep up the fight! #RESISTANCE #Trumprussia  We are @CbusIndivisible
The only fight Sherrod has is to keep his pocket fat!
Thank you for not getting distracted by the chaos.
we love you, senator brown
No we don't!  You do!
Thank u so much for all the great investigatory work bringing the corruption to the forefront.
Brown typical of corrupt DNC. Ellison represents FARRAKAN, Brown on board with malfeasance
Thanks Sherrod! We appreciate u! #ThankYouSherrod #Ohio #IndependentInvestigation #yaySherrod
No we don't....you do!
Good luck, Senator 
No thank you from West Central Ohio!
Please keep pushing for an independent investigation!
Thank you, Senator! Appreciate you pushing forward with this. Great job, Rachel & Adam!
Let's just find out the Truth. Americans and our democracy demand the Truth. #ShowUsYourTaxes
@LarryWilson @adamdavidson @POTUS @maddow Ohio is fortunate. I'm stuck with Thune and Rounds a buffoon and a crook.
My thought was if this deal violated US laws, then why wasn't Trump vetted during t/primary?
Didn't admit it?
Thank you Senator for your leadership in this. I'm a proud constituent.
Stay on the Russia story. Trump's connections to Russia are the main story in this sad saga.
@NonnaSJF @adamdavidson @POTUS @maddow  im glad you are paying attention to Rachel Senator !
You r 1 of the rare few Senators that "go to work ea day." This means so much 2 So Many. Ty!!
love Rachel
Excellent reporting! FCPA must investigate b/c Politicians bogged down with Party B4 USA! 
Are you listening @GOP @MitchMcConell @SpeakerRyan? #StandUpToTrump w @SenSherrodBrown @adamdavidson @maddow or go down w #TrumpSinkingShip
Thank you! #INVESTIGATETRUMPNOW #Trumprussia #TrumpTaxReturns @SenSherrodBrown @adamdavidson @POTUS @maddow
Thank you, Senator.
Thanks Sen .Please looked into this
Thank you, Senator, for leading the charge! You make me proud to be from #Ohio.
She put it out there, now it needs to get done.
Really, all of Congress and Justices should be included in the independent investigation.
THANK YOU.
Thank you for speaking up! 
your a good man mr brown
Brown hasn't got ONE constructive thought, just another PC dem hack. Wasting time
Do the right thing
You need to look at the world outside your incestuous frustration with the election loss.
Into what? Trump's world of incestuous behavior towards his daughter?!
keep up the good work!
you are a joke. Obama hasn't uncovered anything with the help of the CIA and NSA. Seat lost!
thank you Senator Brown for having the decency to care about democracy it is becoming rare
Democrats and democracy. That's a laugh! Founders of the KKK and racism maybe.
