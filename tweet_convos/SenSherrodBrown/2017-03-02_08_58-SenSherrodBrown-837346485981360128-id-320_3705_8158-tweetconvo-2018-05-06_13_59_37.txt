a senator spoke to a foreign official. in other news water is wet. prove wrongdoing. otherwise this is a witch hunt.
He lied under oath, that's bigger issue at the moment. Plus speaking to russians when known hacking is bad
The question was in regards to the campaign; not in his other duties. It isn't perjury.
was no direct question 2 Sessions communications specifically.He offered it up al on his own LOL
You can look at the question and his answer online. It's public record. Good try.
I have several times. You apparently cant see what is in front of your own eyes and ears #gaslit
It isn't perjury. Should he recuse himself from the DOJ Russia probe, I'd agree with that.
@SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @SpeakerRyan He lied under oath. He should resign.We cant have AG who lies under oath!
@lskurrus Gop will clarify sessions lie and let it go! Sad
thank you! @senrobportman doesn't see all perjury as equal e.g.Clinton-Sessions. Thx 4 representing us not your friends,SB!
you mean like Hillary or Loretta Lynch etc
oh are they in office? I missed that...
umm they were so you kind of did miss that...did you speak up when Miss Lynch spoke wirh Bill on the tarmac.
yeah I was about 10 then. Stay on topic. Sessions perjured himself-deal with the here and now. 2 wrongs don't make a right
im sorry so your 12 now? And Clinton perjured herself about the servers..always selective memory
*you're. Make a note of it. You're is for you are. Your is for your.
Thank you teacher. . Ill be sure to correct it on my next test
@ArgoJournal Do all Senators that talked to the Russian ambassador also resign
Dems aren't nor is their outrage as Gabbard for meeting with Assad weeks ago..a war criminal
.@SenSherrodBrown Thank you!
Resignation is not enough. Prosecute him on the perjury, or you open up every future Senate hearing to lies.
@Liberal_Lisa @SenSherrodBrown @gaughran444 I'd be fine with resignation 
Wow. That's pretty narrow-minded. Way to attack those who agree with you.
Thank you for your kind response. I detest Sessions. How am I a "whiny jerk?"
THANKS! Someone with a backbone!
.@SenSherrodBrown  Sessions lied in his written responses to .@alfranken Yet .@SenateGOP confirmed him .@GOP is like Nero Keep fiddling
.@SenSherrodBrown Investigate Russian connection but don't let it distract u frm the systematic deconstruction of admin st going on around u
follow this example @senrobportman Country over party. Thanks Sen. Brown for standing w/the people.
.@SenSherrodBrown .@TheDemocrats .@HouseDemocrats .@SenateDems .@GOP .@HouseGOP .@SenateGOP Time 4 some Profiles in Courage Sessions must go
did you also meet with the Russians?
@OHDems while he's resigning, have @robportman do the same for selling out our children @OhioBATs @BadassTeachersA #Tbats
hahahahaha hahahaha
I'm ashamed to see you playing politics so shamelessly. I thought you were a better man. My mistake. Recusal is appropriate
I wholeheartedly agree. Then he should be questioned in person in the Senate to explain his lies. #LockHimUp
Obstruct and investigate everything. Partisan politics will not serve you or the public. Democrats will regret their action
But, come what may, they will have our thanks and the respect of History for standing for America.
#impeachsessions
You are out of your mind. Stop this BS...
pick it up Senator- let's go.  Light fires.
With all do respect Senator you are a Democrat & Democrats have no power due to failing to understand your constitutes.
Eric Holder didn't resign did he; and his sins were more egregious than Sessions'
what about the last AG meeting with Clinton,  that's ok because she was a democrat?
Yes ..why is he still there? He needs to go!
You hit the nail on the head The lie is worse than the deed. The deed is bad. America deserves integrity & ethics in our AG
prosecute for perjury. Not above the law
The question was in regards to campaign; not Senatorial duties. It isn't perjury unless that is proven.
I'd call but in at work. Thank you so much Senator. This is a big step in the right direction. Ohio thanks you
// Yes.
you are correct sir !
Thank you, as always, Senator Brown. You always have our backs and you never disappoint. We believe in you.
@Kris_Sacrebleu the Russians are killing Their stakeholders in this. Trump Cant (yet).lock
 Him in
My thoughts exactly.
I agree please fight for our health care in Ohio
...and as you request resignation, Rep @DevinNunes threatens reporters with investigations: http://www.rawstory.com/2017/03/be-careful-gop-intel-chair-threatens-to-investigate-reporters-for-persisting-on-sessions/ â€¦
how can he remain in office after lying under oath. He knew he had lied when he was sworn in.  It was with intent
.@SenSherrodBrown And be charged.
rather see you resign.
God bless America thank you Senator Brown
that was ALWAYS the only option....or @realDonaldTrump should relieve him of his duties
Coming forward after your exposed. Then wanting to explain by letter only? Not exactly an altruistic effort.
and that is not enough either, Charge him with Perjury! Ask President Clinton what happens when you lie under oath!
@ourwhim keep pushing resignation @realDonaldTrump should fire #Sessions due to #russiagate but 45 won't fire crony
i am watching your votes. You are a 2 faces representative. Talking is cheap
1st crooked @SpeakerRyan & @SenMajLeader @senmajneed to go The corruption goes deep & we all know it Let's clean up #resist

I completely agree but I also feel that charges of treason should be placed against him
@ndylan1 this would be best for Trump administration. One less distraction.
Thank you for being one of the few sane voices we are hearing in Ohio leadership.
#danaboente is no better. Follow @LouiseMensch
Thank you Senator. I'm very proud to be one of your constituents.
@LynneElmira The sooner, the better....
AG Sessions didn't lie.. By spreading false story you have lied to American people. I call on you to resign immediately.
nothing less is exceptable.
@ChrisCuomo Can somebody tell me how many Democrat Senators had meeting with the Russian Ambassador?  Should they resign?
fake news...
starting with @POTUS n @VP . This government is planting the seed of hate in general . We r going backwards in everything
thank you senator, you make Ohio proud!
I think YOU should resign, sir. I have no faith in you, and you have revealed yourself as a political hack!
You just lost my vote - sincerely Ohio Independent Voter
for what.  Telling the truth. Then u take a question and generalize it. U will be voted out in 19 months.
An Attorney General who commits perjury very MUST be fired.
The people have not forgotten Holder and fast and furious.
thank you, Senator Brown!
Senator Brown. I hereby call for your resignation.
.@SenSherrodBrown   I am so thankful and proud to have @senrobportman as my Senator and @JoshMandelOhio as my future Senator.
Remember when you were outraged when B Clinton met L Lynch on tarmac. That's right, you weren't
ok
GOP gave you recuse, that's a lot for the GOP to give, they can give anymore ok?
Keep fighting for us.
_Jeff Sessions, Flynn, Kushner be interrogated to unearth the anti-U.S. secret deals they made with  vicious enemy, Russia.
total bs and u. Know it
@deejay90192 Especially in light of the newest @WSJ story. Follow the money.
@hill55willie  get over yourself. Damn Libtards were ok with Clintons crap and Obamas but oh now you have issues.
not gonna happen
Thank you for standing strong for us.
Yes, because he is compromised!
@evan7257 Attention Ohio Republicans! Opening for Senate Seat! Sherrod Brown lost his IQ &EQ: too stupid to stay in office!
Whew! I just read an article and your name wasn't listed among those asking for resignation or recusal. I knew better!
have you ever met the Russian ambassador or anyone from the embassy?
@realDonaldTrump DO SOMETHING !
I agree, I called the number and I also tweeted he must resign!
Eric Holder ran guns to Mexico, lied to Congress about it, was found in contempt & never prosecuted. And YOU were silent
NO HONOR AMONG THIEVES! Sessions used political funds for Russian envoy
You must resign
you must resign
did you say the same thing when Loretta Lynch met with Bill Clinton?
add on. Misusing campaign funds to meet with russians.
Absolutely!
Why are you voting for ANY Trump appointees? They are all #swamp creatures.
Dems are just witch hunting, They couldnt win election even w all of mainstream media, intel agencies, and $$ on their side
You are a stooge, and I am an Ohio Voter. Sessions didn't speak to Russia as a Trump surrogate but a senator
true, anyone else would go to jail!
Thank you!
demand it. Yes.
Please, point us to the crime because according to the FBI there wasn't one
How about finding a way to precipitate that!
Thank you for your leadership!  We must get to the bottom of the Russian connection!!
Wish I believed it will happen. He should never have been approved in the first place.
thanks you
yes. Thank you for standing up for decency.
Stay Loud Senator!!
