@Lawrence Sherrod a big asshat.  And WTF is a Sherrod?
@SenSchumer @YouTube named Sanford. He's jailed 4yrs ago in TX on fraud trying 2 build bank on St Croix. Mnchen & he pals?
thank you Senator Brown. I know you're listening. It means everything to this voter.
Let's show these Fascists what a couple of hillbillies can do!

Then don't vote for him Sherrod  Ur my senator
Carson did poorly and yet was approved unanimously. WILL ANYONE EVER SAY NO TO TRUMP?
Who is researching your fortune? Who is crucifying you? What enemy would you have choose your minions?
--We lost our home to one of these dirty loans, our interest went from 4.45% to 17.99% they forced us to leave.
@puppymnkey He said it was "unfortunate".
why did you sell us out and vote in favor of Carson? I counted on you as a voice of reason..#Disillusioned&angry
you let him off. I'm very disappointed in the way the Democratic senators let this man skate by.
I'm sure you'll give him the benefit of the doubt turncoat.
@AFLCIO Now it's up to dems, unions, & reporters to highlight the impact on people when policies become active
@SenSchumer you mean because of the lousy economy they lost their jobs, couldn't pay their bills and went into foreclosure?
@SenSchumer @YouTube reach out 2 the Brits Anguilla is their territory. Some of their rich hides $ there. Ck on a person
He paid $1billion more than the next bidder.  Should gov't have taken the lower bid or worse just let IndyMac go bankrupt?
Real villains were TBTF banks making predatory loans & using IndyMac to service the TBTF crappy loans Mnuchin inherited
Saw your mention of Rita Lewis at hearing for Mnuchin. Thank You Senator. Michigan Retired Teamsters applauds you Sir.
Thank you for voting NO to these horrible selections for cabinet posts.  We have to push back constantly next 4 yrs
@SenSchumer Its obvious you idiots have no idea how banks operate or the impact your rediculous rules have on them.
@SenSchumer @YouTube 
They were offered modifications! A bank is not a welfare agency.
every single cabinet pick is deplorable, unqualified and corrupt. Perfect for Trump to surround himself with like.
trumps now president ...impeach his ass
Thank You Sen for your Questioning & for standing up against that ass chairman!  Keep it up. We are behind 110%
We need our Democratic Senators to be strong now more than ever.... thank you!
please vote no against all the dangerously unqualified cabinet nominees.
@realDonaldTrump why would you nominate this person if your real interest is the American people?
you have an agenda and you hate the majority of Americans just like your party.  Keep up the good work
Thank you Senator Brown for asking the hard questions and not backing down on such important issues!
masterful, senator...watching you expose this depraved monster. Well done and thank you!
he is very disrespectful. Rich doesn't make you right. Ethics do matter
Even you know that's not true.
This is what happens when someone like you lives off taxpayer money cloistered in Washington - no sense of the real world.
Thank you for being so blunt and on point with Mnuchin @SenSherrodBrown I appreciate it!
where's the petition to block him? Can't find on your site.
Oooh. Let's talk about Bill & Hillary scamming people in Haiti. & Bill raping women. Keep on.
you did an amazing job today!
please confirm Jeff sessions.  I am From Toledo.
HAMMER THEM MERCILESSLY!  Thank you!!!
What about your own Democratic boy:
Keep up the fight. Ohio is proud of you!
95 million n we want him for Dept of treasury...seriously
If you ain’t got the cash, you’re not worth the trash. At least to guys who forget to mention little things like $100 mill.
Thank you for defending the home owners!
you didn't give him a chance to answer your questions! That is a very poor performance on your part. You acted like a baby
You were quite right today about the totally inappropriate "joke" about Valium. Hardly in the spirit of sincerity.
Got a little heated in there today.
I appreciate your principled service, @SenSherrodBrown
Charade should be the proper spelling of your name sir. you are as big a crook as anyone
Mnuchin is repulsively sociopahic w no morals just like many for-profit entities Govt is NOT for profit NO to Mnuchin
Thx for good questioning of this repulsive man
There is still comments about all those that lost their homes in a blog.They all tried to stop them but they took the homes
No mercy,not humble,greedy.
As required by Fed law & regulations
How does he forget about 100 million worth of assets?
we're proud of the work  you did today.
Just say NO
@Lawrence Senator. We, the people, are counting on lawmakers on The Hill to prevent this (& other) disastrous appointments
Thank you Senator.   So proud that you were my representative today.  Keep up the good fight.
Keep up the good work Senator.  Proud to have you as my Senator.
Thank you for taking your stand! <3 #Mnuchin  body language was horrible!
I hope you fail to vote for his confirmation.
@TheDemocrats @SenSchumer Mnuchin.Ppl still trying to recover from foreclosures,ruined credit. Predatory Lending.
American citizenry should be concerned & alarmed by lack of credibility, ethics &/or exp of many of Trump's noms.
Thank you.  And for the remark to Roberts,  it was out of like
you need to be honest - the government agencies control how these were done... HARP
IT includes Hamp too.The people had the papers thrown in the trash but checks were cashed! They knew what they did
Say no to Swamp Lips!
why not bring up it was all made possible by Clinton removing Glass-Steagall? He made very smart business calls
funny you blame smart ppl that see what is happening and not the people that actually caused the problem in 1st place. @CNN
Get over yourselves. All of the Trump appointees are the most highly qualified for the job in decades. USA 1st!
you obviously didn't watch the DeVos hearing. She's far from qualified
thank you for voting no!
so proud that you are our senator! Keep fighting for us!
@SenSchumer @YouTube Wow. This is not grilling someone, this is just hopping on a pulpit and being obnoxious.
most of us are truly concern that his sight is on privatizing @FreddieMac & @FannieMae . He must be blocked!
I am so grateful and so very proud to call you my Senator. I truly appreciate the work that you do.  
@SenSchumer @YouTube He has a coop at 740 Park and a house in Bel-Air. That alone is about 100 million.
ACA costs me enormous $. I was in USMC during recession and paid my mortgage. u punished me with socialized medicine
50% of hearing was about past mortgage deals, 0 ? on fed, bal budget, spending cuts or any relevant topic.
We're counting you Sherrod to vote NO!
Thank you for fighting for homeowners, and thank you for voting NO on #Mnuchin nomination
The Republicans think if they let him get through with all of his cabinet that he will go easy on them are so wrong they are  the swamp
@SenSchumer @YouTube why would he answer gotcha questions from a hack who made up his mind before the hearing. Ur the joke.
Thank you!
you weren't interested in hearing his responses. Very disappointing
@SenSchumer these conformation have been turned into a travesty by these republicans.
Thank you for pushing him.
You failed to listen to his answer.  You were too busy looking for a sound bite.
@SenSchumer @YouTube Dude can't even settle on a smug expression, just constantly switches between them.
Growing the economy with "rent-seeking" sought by Trump and Mnuchin will also bring us feudalism.  Enough!
@Lawrence Yet he will get confirmed right? The republicans are beyond despicable and have NO moral compass 
@SenSchumer @YouTube how many of you who didn't vote for last POTUS looted?
Read the Guardian 1/19/17  Congress moves to give away Federal lands ... MAGA - SAD   This is an outrage!!
don't approve the #SwampCabinet
@SenSchumer it was them dems that started the housing crisis you forget that ?????????
The man's clearly not used to being asked difficult questions and gets defensive. How will he be accountable to the people?
And he will be confirmed anyway.
but he "is looking forward to discussing that with you in the future" wasn't that his go to statement. Thank youSB
@SenSchumer @SenSherrodBrown He's a US Wall Street trained banker. What do you expect? The real targets should be GOP Congressional enablers
absolutely unconscionable.  This sickens me.  How does he even begin to relate to or understand the common man?
@SenSchumer Thank You for being the voice for All Americans not just the filthy rich
How can these people even be considered for these positions when they IN FACT helped to destroy people's lives!!!
these corrupt crooks should never be allowed in our government. This includes @realDonaldTrump
There's always a story behind those folks you address but don't explain. Pursuit of happiness, not guarantee of.
@trulyguide @YouTube Sickening its the chabad lubavitch mafia son in law look no further
@Lawrence please please give it a rest. This record is so old and so broken. Tome deaf Dems still don't get it.
@SenSchumer There is probably a perfectly good reason! You don't know what the seniors, servicemen, workers did to him!
@Lawrence @YouTube then make damn sure you stop him !
@Lawrence @YouTube You mean kicking ppl out that didn't PAY their mortgages. That's part of the loan you make idiot.
@SenSchumer @YouTube I think the term is 'hell no'
@Lawrence @YouTube He should be in prison
if @BarackObama was doing his job, they would not need decrepit homes with all the bounty to be made killing
From a man from Tn. Luv ya man. Wish we could have Sen and reps like U. Due to gerrymandering here, my vote makes no diff.
Thank You sir for fighting for us- we will never accept this traitor 2 WH &his incompetent scum he is put forward
@Lawrence @YouTube don't banks lose money on foreclosures (selling property for less than face value of debt)
In all fairness he didn't fail, he wasn't given the opportunity to defend himself @SenSherrodBrown @SenSchumer @YouTube
@SenSchumer brown failed at doing his entire job just a big mouth leftist
Did anyone ask about his Bernie Madoff $$$?
@SenSchumer @YouTube "Munchkin" is such a douche. Take him down, nail him to the wall. Not deserving confirmation.
Stop your whining and be American and help the more you resist the more of you will not be elected in 2018
@SenSchumer @YouTube stay on these people. I'm telli you it's a total mess getting old even when you do your due diligence
@SenSchumer @YouTube 
You are part of the law making body.
Own it
@SenSchumer he should not be confirmed. Why reward bad behavior?
keep up the good fight !
Thank you for asking him.
thank you, now don't forget to vote against @BetsyDeVos
Thank you for trying to slow down the rubber stamp process. Your questions were insightful. I'm behind you all the way!
is the wittle mangina snowflake that can't take a joke about valium
#OhioWeepsHavingThisMentalMidgetRepresentingOhioans
You are fighting for our Nation.  Know we support you.  DO NOT LET UP. Thank you!
We appreciate you Senator. Please vote NO!
Thank you for standing up for working  Americans!
Did the press or some senators fail to hold him accountable for answering that question?
I guess he didn't like the sound of "I'm a shitty human being" coming out of his mouth. Thanks for pressing him Senator!
The mentioned of foreclosure on military families got to him and he tried addressing it.. but failed....
you do realize foreclosure is a legal procedure, even in Ohio, don't you?  Anyone who runs a bank must foreclose at times
He also may have lied about the $100 million he "forgot" to disclose.
@DavidYankovich @YouTube Dear Sen Brown, JUST SAY NO, Please.
Thank you for all that you do for Ohio.  History will be on your side.
Thank you for standing up and voting against Mnuchin!!
Very proud to have you as my senator.
yeah they ask these questions but they themselves set up the procedure
as a citizen what can I do??? Feel helpless..I am sure many feel the same as I do
Nothing. This didnt happen today, it happened in November when the United States became a one party state.
there is something we can do..we can protest LOUDLY...
