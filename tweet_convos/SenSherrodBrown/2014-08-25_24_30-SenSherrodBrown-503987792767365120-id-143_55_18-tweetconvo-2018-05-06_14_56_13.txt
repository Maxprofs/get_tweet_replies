@SenSherrodBrown @0103lrl @BurgerKing Either you guys fix this or we will! #BoycottBK is in full swing and we will ruin their business!
@SenSherrodBrown @0103lrl @BurgerKing Once we are done their effective Tax Rate will be 0%! Can't pay taxes if your business is gone!
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing I will eat at Burger King. Grow up!
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing Thank you Senator Brown. I think Wendy's or White Castle r very good alternatives if BK follows thru in moving.
@CarolYBenson @SenSherrodBrown how about lowering the corporate tax rate and keep more countries here?
@HeacockMark @SenSherrodBrown Corporations already have it pretty sweet, they're just being greedy.
My agenda for today: Walk to @TimHortons's for some Timbits and swing by @BurgerKing for a Whopper Jr for dinner. @SenSherrodBrown

It's a free country & if they want to move, so be it! Dem gov can't stand it if they can't control everyone! @SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing    The Fair Tax would eliminate Corp. Tax and stop Politicians from playing favorites.
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing   How dumb are you when Canada has 46% lower taxes than America.
.@SenSherrodBrown I agree. This is a big problem. These companies are traitorous scum. But the term "inversion" 's gotta go.

"..the ignorance of a crass demogague" #SherrodBrown- #BurgerKing (owned by Brazil) http://thefederalist.com/2014/08/26/the-lefts-ridiculous-burger-king-freakout/ …
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing - actually, our screwed up tax system and the nazi-like #IRS is a whopper for us taxpayers, idiot.
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing I would think a US Senator would be smart enough to pull up a map and notice Canada is not overseas
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing TOOL & CRONIES don't do their homework! #bk run by 3G Capital of Brazil NOT USA http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/5715697 …
@SenSherrodBrown yet u we're ALL SILENT as Obama Bud jeff immelt (GE) kept $108billion out of US 2 avoid taxes.
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing Hey, asshat. Just a year or so ago, you lefties claimed corps don't pay ENOUGH taxes, pick a side.
@obamaphone2 @SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing no don't you dare lower their taxes, they don't get to rape us and move to canada!
@TeddyKis You are an obvious economic ignoramus! @obamaphone2 @SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing
@BuckeyeDave93 @obamaphone2 @SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing Obvious, really dies it show .. I know taxes are the lowest they have ever been
@TeddyKis The US has the HIGHEST corp tax rate in the developed world, 35%. Canada's is 15%! @obamaphone2 @SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing
@BuckeyeDave93 @obamaphone2 @SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing history is hard, but bush cut the tax rate for corp
@TeddyKis Actually history is one oy favorite subjects. BTW, you're facts or not quite correct! @obamaphone2 @SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing
@BuckeyeDave93 @obamaphone2 @SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing when you factor in tax credits and offshore tax havens. What did they pay?
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing @BryceCrawford If I owned a global biz I'd LOVE to pay punitive US taxes on profits earned in other countries.
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing 
And if they stayed and went out of business because of your tax and spending ways is that better ???? Idiots !
HERES THOUGHT....> @SenSherrodBrown << WHY don't U Senators spend less & LOWER TAX RATES 4 ALL AND THEN YOU would be Patriotic! @BurgerKing
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing I'm going to Burger King 4 breakfast! Maybe if u money hogging liberals would reduce corp tax rates they'd stay
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing Lower the corporate tax rate more will stay.  Even JFK understood tax principles.
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing Especially disgusting since Obamacare gets them cheaper, better employee healthcare coverage!
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing maybe our taxes shouldn't be so flippin' high. #leftieslogic
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing we poor Canucks are so-o-o lucky to have you next door. #TimHortons is the better part of the deal. Say thanks!
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing been boycotting BK since fave Double Whopper w/cheese approached $6. If they get it back under $5 I'm on board
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing Another one of many whoppers spewed by a disgraceful politician.  Ridiculous tax rates are to blame Senator
@WrobStv @SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing actually going to BK now.  Support BK boycott jackass Sherrod Brown
@WrobStv @SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing Nice intelligent response there.  So predictable from extremists like yourself.
@WrobStv @SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing Never said it was 40% did I?
@SenSherrodBrown U duplicitous jerk, why don't u propose lowering the US Corp tax rate from 35%, highest in developed world?! @BurgerKing
@BuckeyeDave93 @brianpirlo @SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing Lower taxes? They don't know how. Raise taxes? Oh they know how to do that.
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing How about we boycott every company/institution that employees SEIU workers Sherrod?
Wow, Dim Bulb @SenSherrodBrown thinks @BurgerKing Horton deal (in Canada) is an "overseas" deal! He's such a Geography Whiz..NOT. #OH #tcot
@AskYnow @SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing-Thank his Ohio voters.
Oh, & BTW @SenSherrodBrown your @BurgerKing "Whopper" tweet isn't even clever, it is just plain #Lame. #tcot #OH #TaxpayersWantItTheirWay

@SenSherrodBrown You are a whole lot of stupid aren't you. Scares me that you are on any committee that deals with money. #yayBK #moron
Canada is now overseas? Well I guess Lake Erie counts. MT @SenSherrodBrown: .@BurgerKing’s  plan to move profits overseas...
@SenSherrodBrown How about a boycott of Hollywood? Movies are shot in Canada save on labor costs and taxes.Oh right-Hollywood big Dem donor
Demonize royalty you chased away. MT @SenSherrodBrown .@BurgerKing’s plan to move profits overseas would be a Whopper for American taxpayers
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing check out whos a BIG WIG at BK sen feinstein Husband the elite rich get RICHER!!
@SenSherrodBrown Also, you do realize that corporations don't pay taxes. Companies like @BurgerKing pass that along to consumers. #myrmidon
@SenSherrodBrown I applaud @BurgerKing for moving to Canada to avoid the punitive tax structure that you and your ilk champion.
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing  Warren Buffett is helping to fund the deal by committing $3 billion for this move...tax loving Obama supporter
@SenSherrodBrown well warren buffets financing it, he's the democrats poster boy billionaire that preaches taxing rich more...
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing Go buy a comb
@SenSherrodBrown it's your bad corp. tax rate that is sending @BurgerKing to Canada! I will not #BoycottBurgerKing I will #BoycottDemacrates
@JamesAnjanette Wow, James.  You can't even spell "Democrats"?  #Republicansarestupid
@tlsmith1963 wow! Thanks for the correction,I'm sure your 173 followers will appreciate it!
@SenSherrodBrown #BurgerKing When did #Canada become "overseas"? I did'nt think Lake Erie was all that big. #PeaBrain
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing Dems and Reps should get together to lower the corp tax rate before we lose more businesses. #WakeUpCall
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing Already boycotting thanks to the rainbow wrapper, but nice try, lib.
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing We should organize a boycott. Vote against politicians that take profits from companies to fund pet projects
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing If you don't like it, fix the tax code. Don't tax foreign profits a second time.
.@SenSherrodBrown You only have yourselves 2 blame in the Congress and Senate for outrageous tax rates & no incentive to stay in the USA.
@SenSherrodBrown haha funny how "I don't pay enuf in taxes " @WarrenBuffett is leading the takeover #iwasforhighertaxesb4iwasagainstit
@SenSherrodBrown But then, you love to stick it to business with taxes, so of course you wouldn't understand. @BurgerKing
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing name a tax % that would be right...it's at a ridiculous 40%. You're making this a big issue so just name the %.
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing it's bc of #DNC #tax & #spend they leave. Better solution is to vote folks like you out of office. #jobs #gop
@SenSherrodBrown Try the Unfathomable Brown Whopper! Makes you dumb enough to believe the highest corp tax rate won't cause biz to flee USA.
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing and when all the burger joints in America leave b/c their taxes r too high, u can turn to sushi. wake up, fool.
@SenSherrodBrown Yeah, Democrat policies suck!
.@SenSherrodBrown you & your party's policies are why @BurgerKing is leaving. Everyone who works & is honest w/themselves understands this.
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing I support Burger King on their decision. I'll be sure to stop there more often.
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing As for you, Senator, have never had my support. I live in Ohio and can't wait for you to be voted out.
@SenSherrodBrown seriously?  are you that big of a piece of crap?  quit taxing the hell out of corporations!!!!
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing Oh I'll b going to Burger King today and tomorrow and the next day. Corps r'nt funding vehcls for govt. DA!
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing BTW, Canada is not "overseas".
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing Who blames them? BK may be "abandoning" the US, but your congress has abandoned logic and reasonable governing.
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing ill be eating at BK everyday for lunch.
@SenSherrodBrown You Senator, are an example of a Bloated Greedy Government that refuses to live within its means. cc:@BurgerKing #tcot
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing God Bless America. I'll eat six for every oneburger boycotted. Get out of our lives and pocket books Dem
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing We should boycott idiot politicians like you who drive businesses out of the US with your thieving tax schemes.
.@SenSherrodBrown maybe you & President Obama can meet with his economic advisor & Medal of Freedom winner Warren Buffet?
@SenSherrodBrown Where is your call to boycott companies owned by Warren Buffett (Big DEM Donor) as he is financing??? I can hear pin drop!
@SenSherrodBrown are you going to learn that businesses are in business to make money. To stop this, make it more profitable to stay.
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing  I'll be eating at Burger King for lunch for the rest of the week in your honor today.
@SenSherrodBrown You gotta hate it when there is less loot for you to confiscate, eh? Sometimes you just can't #haveityourway
When "Senators" publicly call for a boycott of American Co's -@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing and Libs like you keep raising taxes thinking the problem is the corporation. Time to vote out #BigGov senators
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing Dem moron Sherrod Brown makes case for corp tax reform by calling for idiotic boycott of the King  #BurgerKing
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing Maybe congress should implement term limits so you'll actually do your job while you're in office!
@SenSherrodBrown consumers should turn to organic non-GMO produce, not BK, White Castle or Wendys. reform tax code and end #bigAg subsidies
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing Boycotting is your answer? Maybe the govt should make the our country more business friendly.
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing You are the problem, I hope the voters " boycott" you.
@SenSherrodBrown So we should be mad at @BurgerKing because you fools have driven them away w/ high tax rates? Get a job dude.
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing Fix the fact that US charges the highest effective tax rate! Your solution is to boycott? Really! Get to work!
@SenSherrodBrown @BurgerKing Lower taxes.  Flat tax of 10 percent everyone pays including welfare
