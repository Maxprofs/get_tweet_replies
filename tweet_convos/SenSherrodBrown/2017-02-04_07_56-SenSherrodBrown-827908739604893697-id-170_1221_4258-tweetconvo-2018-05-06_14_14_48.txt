Sorry, in this case it just puts American lives at risk. If there's another terror attack in the US your party is at fault!
Actually, radicalization experts agree that it is anti-Muslim rhetoric that aids extremist recruitment.
Rhetoric?? Haven't all acts of modern terror been performed by Muslims?Not all Muslims are terrorists but...
What about Dylann Roof? Timothy McVeigh? Shall I continue? Or are you only into revisionist history?
Single acts of mental disorders and not religion based. Radical Islamic Terror. This is our terror.
P.S. You would fail high school debate with that argument, just FYI.
Guess I'm glad I'm not in high school. I'm a member of the Old Skool when people loved their country and God!
how is this unconstitutional?  Please don't quote the Statue of Liberty poem.
It violates Equal Protection, First Amendment, Habeus Corpus... shall I continue?
Non citizens are not covered by our constitution.
Actually, they do.  That's what the Equal Protections clause is.
Violation of the 1st is a stretch. Equal protection and Habeus would have more ground if...
If there weren't grounds for constitutional argument re: the ban, fed judges wouldn't be issuing TROs.
You certainly have a great deal of misplaced faith.
Faith in the Constitution and in the power of the judicial branch is not misplaced. It is a strength.
Thank you for your tireless work on behalf of Ohioans and our Constitution. Please don't let up on this Administration.
President Trump has one goal in mind on this. Keep America Safe. The Dems could care less and it shows.He will serve 8yrs.
When will the idiot in the White House be impeached?
We did that already. President Clinton...remember??!!  He was surely an idiot!
shut up douchebag
u mean the corrupt judge who violated US law on the books he violated the american constitution needs to be disbarred
how was this decision unconstitutional?? The judge or DR? Clearly DT over reached and went against our values
I guess if the Constitution is a flexible document that means whatever you want it to mean you can uphold anything you want
thanks for your compassionate and principled leadership. Proud to have you as my senator.
Absolutely. Call out Trump for discrediting the judiciary (and any office/person who disagrees with him).
Executive has plenary power over who gets in.  This is overreach.
I'm really glad that both our Democrat and Republican (@robportman ) senators oppose the #MuslimBan. Not a partisan issue.
Proud of Senators Portman and Brown!!
Tell me where the Constitution says anything about non-citizens.
I'm so glad you and your party are out of power.
LOL...Independent meaning left wing judges like Ruthie.  No thanks.
@SenSchumer Praise the founders intellect for protecting the political system from tyrannical misfits like this one-smart.
@SenSchumer it's not a Muslim ban. Can't wait to vote against you soon. Yep I live in Ohio.#SuperMajority2018
I am in Ohio as well!  It is time for a Republican landslide!
Thanks to Judge Robart and also to you, Sherrod Brown of OHIO!  Proud of you!
agreed! Can we please do something about @BetsyDeVos and   Steve Bannon?
You know nothing about democracy!  We voted AGAINST the obama communist agenda and we reject you denying free.
you sir are supporting an action that puts Americans at risk. Nit unconstitutional read it maybe you'll learn something
who is saving these christian children from there acid bath?
Schumer called for extreme vetting in 2015, now he protests because DONALD TRUMP is @potus
is it constitutional for a President to issue such a ban?
Why is it important to block this temporary travel restriction when the last several Presidents have restricted the same?
You are so right! The checks and balances are there for reasons such as this.
Hurray! Judge Robarts has none of the traits that Trump can easily use to attack: Robarts is male & white & Bush appointee.
@SenSchumer
@SenSchumer We will remember your name the next time a refugee kills inside the USA. you should be held responsible .
Robart doesn't understand a basic legal principle called "standing". He must've missed the question on Bar Exam
you can't be that dumd
Don't let up! Right is right and Yes, WRONG IS ACTUALLY WRONG! Keep fight against DEVOS, Kasich & Portman took $$ from her!
it's the radical elements that I don't think you understand!
2018!
bull shit
Balance of Power part of our Democracy. Don't start a Constitutional crisis.
do we get to hold that judge accountable if a terrorist comes in because the ban was lifted?
see pick of what Sr Christine Pratt, me and my students were doing today.  At Open Houses at Islamic Center, Cincy
Oh, that's ok...Supremes will hold up EO.
Scared the Kochs n Repubs will buy them just like they bought Congress!
Property records indicate his address is 1846 East Shelby Street, Seattle, 97122. Thanks for the platform, Sherrod.
If it is a muslim ban, why is egypt, the country with the highest muslim percentage, not included?
Courts are the only salvation in this madness now!
@SenSchumer Thank you both.
@senrobportman
Critical is opinion our Vets sacrificing lives! Steven Gern,U.S. Marine in Iraq on ban https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piPex1CrTmU â€¦
It's #NotAMuslimBan Obama picked countries on the list. Feel free to keep lying to Ohioans by saying it is, 2018 is coming.
YES. U R my senator. With repubs in Congress in their Koch haze it's gonna be up to judiciary I'm afraid. Donating to ACLU.
Get ready sherrod you will be out soon
you two may be sucking on those words when @Scotus upholds @potus order. Such a pair of assess. Ashamed in Ohio
you're a great American thank you
Not a #muslimban simpleton! #fakenews
You're next to go. #politicalhack #givingdopesavoice #noclue
@SenSchumer He is not upholding our Constitution. Judge Robart should be removed from the bench.
@GerberKawasaki wrong
@SenSchumer it is not a "Muslim ban" you bold faced liar!
are constitution is not for illegals its for the american people
@SenSchumer President Trump has a constitutional right to secure our nation with a temp halt to some immigration.
thank you for your hard work. Keep it up!
is a TEMPORARY ruling, President Trump will prevail as he has the right to control immigration
UR my hope 2 defeat DJT & his white supremacist  world domination ideals. We need white men 2help fight 4the rights of all.
@SenSchumer what Muslim ban? The one that ignores the biggest Muslim countries, that one?
Vote against all of Trump's cabinet nominees
we will remember your spreading of lies Brown. See you for the last time at the polls in 18.
please don't call it a Muslim ban - if an actual ban is later put in place this episode will be seen as crying wolf
@SenSchumer He should be held as an accomplice to anything that happens because of his ruling.
he meant "criminal" to democracy. Ban muslims!
im sure Bannon is scheming to take over the Judicial branch.  Remove him !
@SenSchumer : MAGA
dumb!

Its #ExtremeVetting
still promoting the fake #muslimban I see! Can't wait for @JoshMandelOhio beat you in 2018.
@POTUS Robart's ruling orders unlimited visas. Why have visas? Just fly millions of refugees to Robart's court.
thank you for speaking out!

@SenSchumer Not a BAN
Is that what happened?  I think Trump was in compliance with the constitution and the judge was a political hack.
the end of your party is on the edge of extinction one major incident in a major city would cause that to happen. Wake up
so your socialist communist party is willing to let islamic terrorist refugees to roam freely in our country uncheck?Thanks
#roar
if a major city in the USA gets nuke by one of these islamic refugees well you feel the same way or is that what it takes?
@SenSchumer @JACM0313 @realDonaldTrump No one is above the law. Not even our #SOCALLEDPRESIDENT
Good JOB Judge Robart!
@SenSchumer now more than ever
@SenSchumer plain old fact people can't be racist even more when they are behind their computer or typing on their phone
finally balance of powers to uphold our democracy. Sessions will rubber stamp like W.'s AG did for torture , approve .
@SenSchumer this isn't a Muslim ban only in your eyes. May the blood of Americans be on your hands!
ALL Dems have to vote NO, on principle. They changed the rules; compromise at this point makes us weak. Be strong!
Dick! There is nothing unconstitutional about it. U need to get educated. He is within his power to do it.
@SenSchumer Sad that it was necessary & doesn't resolve the prob TODAY for those who's visas were stamped & need new ones.
Don't let someone who doesn't respect the Court nominate a judge.  Hold firm and resist!
@SenSchumer you guys and the "Muslim ban" you are doing nothing more than pandering to your delusional followers.
unfortunately for you most of them don't vote. We do and will remember all of this at election time
@SenSchumer keep resisting don't stop
@SenSchumer
@SenSchumer Just like the previous unprecedented cases such as Roe v Wade, Everson v BOE & DRED Scott
@SenSchumer Thank you Senator for explaining the constitution to the president
Exactly.  Go find some extra votes to get rid of DeVos nomination!
let us hope the democrats will regroup and win elections again!
@SenSchumer How about to give honesty a chance?
agree
What Muslim ban? Only certain countries are on list, vast majority of larger ones aren't. Stop the propaganda.

Nice try. It is a temporary travel restriction but it's on countries, not Muslims.
@SenSchumer it also emphasize how many checks and balances failed in order to reach this situation
@SenSchumer.  Also, what does Robart's ruling have to do with democracy.  IT IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE!!
BY conferring Constitutional rights to non citizens, and it not being a muslim ban, you guys make more #fakenews. #Democrat
Because what the framers of the Constitution clearly wanted was America transformed into a Third World jihadi shithole.
Do any of you really care who comes into our countries? Your liberal actions make us less safe every day.
As opposed to the "conservatives" who just voted to let mentally unstable people buy guns?
@realDonaldTrump are you going to do a blanket ban to combat this judges decision and call for immediate impeachment?
@SenSchumer.  WHAT DOES THAT RULING HAVE ANYTHING 2 DO W/ THE CONSTITUTION??!!  There's no place that says we can't do this
@SenSchumer yes, next the courts are going us make peace treaty with North Korea
@SenSchumer  stop misleading people. It's not on Muslim band
This is an outrageous display of liberal activism. POTUS order is legal per 1182(f) section in Constitution.
@SenSchumer The constitution is our and you nor Fake Tears fight for us. Its not for illegals, refugees nor other countries
@SenSchumer That time when our Russian elected so called president whines about a republican appointed fed Judge. Lol
