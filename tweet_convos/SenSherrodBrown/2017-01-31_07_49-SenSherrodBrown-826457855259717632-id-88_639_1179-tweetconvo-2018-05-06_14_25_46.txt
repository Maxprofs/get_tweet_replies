I starting to love all my #democrats #senators and #house - they start to have backbone !
Agree: Sherrod  Brown seems like a strong, intelligent voice!
Thank you Sen. Brown. Please remember that those who will attack you are only being strategic.
Enough of Democrats slowing down our country! Why when Obama set the same van none of you cried about it?
Please watchhttps://twitter.com/ajplus/status/826503341219852288
None of our leaders acted before 9/11 many signs no one acted, now someone cares to protect us
Agree 9/11 disaster. If Prez Trump really cared Saudis would be on list -15 hijackers Saudi
This is just step 1! He might have inside information, the FBi and CIA are really close to him!
No. He said this on campaign b4 he had security briefings. this is about tearing other people down to build yourself up.
He will break more because of what? The media bought by the 1% owners of everything told you that?
No. He will break more in economy than fix. Break more in foreign policy. Goodnight very late here in east.
LOVE IT!  Go Get EM Sherrod!
Rave at close of day; rejoice for dying incoherent democrats; go into that good night; Go Gentle Into That Good Night!
@NationalNurses @SenSherrodBrown @MSNBC it's a job interview. If you lie you can't get the job!
Thank you @SenSherrodBrown for standing up for Ohioans. @senrobportman, please emulate this example in the future.
@AndrewNBCNews @MSNBC
BULLCRAP
thank you Sen Brown, we're with you!
S. Brown is foolish & I will oppose him!
THANK YOU,
Why not just vote no and move onto the next candidate? This is unethical.
 plan on losing your seat in 2018. Ohio voters are tired of this BS. You chose poorly.
Only the dumb ones

#ObstructionistParty
Unconscionable.  You are wrong.
I'm glad Dems are standing up on their hind legs and fighting back in the face of banal evil.
I'm glad Dems are standing up on their hind legs in the face of what looks a lot like evil.
@SenateDems They are LYING & it should not excused or forgiven!!
Relieve the Democrats of duty Mr. President.
now that's what I call #messaging !
someone should remind Brown that OH went for Trump...bigly
Thank you Senator Brown.  As an Ohioan, I'm with you.
Finally! A backbone
The Democrats are going in a downward spiral and they can't see that so once again we will prevail.
Dems are some crooked corrupt lying cock-suckers AND here's Proof
children @ play
.@AndrewNBCNews Kudos to @SenSherrodBrown @MSNBC
What a moron democrats are slowing down the production of our government and they will pay
Boycotting by Senate is simply a cop out! Buck stops there. Temper tantrums don't supersede the law.
Apologize? If you lie when questioned you should be out.
Exactly!! No apology accepted. Don't give them a chance to lie & then turn on us!
I assume their answers are given under oath...
I do believe they are all questioned under oath. So if they lie, it's perjury.
we won't either 
It will not matter.
Can you say, "nuclear option"!
ROFLALM 
Rolling On Floor Laughing @Libtard Morons
thank you! @SenatorDurbin @SenDuckworth
Taking orders from the Head Clown!
So proud of my #Ohio senator @SenSherrodBrown I would gladly vote for him again!
Resistance is futile. American people are being played for fools!
Senate Dems boycotting votes because their children...
Dems lost credibilty with OBAMA.
yes finally. Stand up and fight!
@neeratanden @SenSherrodBrown Honorable public serpents refuse to participate in perpetuating LIES.
