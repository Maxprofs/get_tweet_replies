.@SenatorIsakson .@SenatorSessions .@TheJusticeDept God Bless him 4 serving our Country & what a good man he really is
Bless your little heart

Not surprised by your decision. You refuse to listen to you constituents. When's your next town hall mtg?
Friday, 2/10 in Greensboro. 10am
should have clarified... in Atlanta.
Greensboro is 1.5 hrs from ATL & it's a Friday at 10 am. Not practical for metro Atl to attend. On purpose?
You care with such passion...  up until til it's a mild inconvenience.
Not looking for a debate, but isn't 50% of state pop in metro ATL? Why not meet in ATL too?
That's a decent question. Have you tried starting a petition and sending it to your local news?
It doesn't matter which side of the fence you're on, we all deserve to be heard.
2 senators from the South supported the KKK with their votes. #NotMySenators #ResignNow
no surprise. But now is the time to show them we won't have it.#Indivisible
they're only thinking in the moment. Remind them election time
we need to remind them all the time.  #standindivisible
They're not listening right now. Blinded by the evil light
we keep telling them anyway. Everytime it gets in the papers we win
Republicans go high, dems go low with the triggered name calling 
Trigger your ass! Repugs sold out to a con man and you dopes fell for it!!!
Terrible
@POTUS @TheJusticeDept did you look at his record???!!!!
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept I can't wait until all this madness hits the fan. You will all regret your actions!
@POTUS @TheJusticeDept @jeffsessions ticket to harm minorities.  Lied thru teeth for confirmation.  EVIL TO CORE!!!
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept You sicken your constituents! Kiss your seat goodbye in the next reelection! #resist
@Ladydiann2 @TheJusticeDept LOCK HER UP AND LET JUSTICE PREVAIL!!!!!
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept Thank you
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept hail hail, the klan's all there
Sessions is a racist who does not respect law. Jim Crow was his law; now nation's!
I have a wait and see attitude on that one. I and other GA voters will hold you responsible
Wow. Did you even listen to any of your constituents Senator? Oh right, the voicemail box is still full.
How about showing some respect for GA constituents and represent us ALL!
Sessions is racist even by Alabama standards. Shame on you for supporting him.
The law applies to all, yes?
you just confirmed a Confederate throwback. Congratulations.
I am a shame of you- you need to retire and go on back to the farm
He is the Wrong choice as he is racist. I am a very upset Georgia resident!!!
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept  Who dropped You on your head?
look it's the Wong girl, Dumb as a rock, and talking in rhetoric..
voting to support a known racist and someone who will not support/protect equal rights  is nothing to be proud of
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept congrats love and blessings
Racist
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept Isakson- You sicken your constituents. Kiss your seat goodbye in the next election!
@realDonaldTrump Praying for you @realDonaldTrump #MadeInTheUSA
I'm surprised their hand didn't go up in flames
congratulations on Senator Sessions becoming the Attorney General
So you're not even pretending to care how your constituents feel now, huh? @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept
no they are not.  When's he next in town, we should go and have a talk
yeah, you should.  Lemme know how that works out.
I will if he ever has the guts to show up.
guaranteed you will do nothing.  Better get your mind right.  We r running it

@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept #Shame You continually ignore the wishes of GA voters.
you will regret all these party line decisions. Just watch and see what you did
are you trying to rub this in people of colors faces??@SenatorSessions openly said the KKK were ok.... and you support that.
The Dems were lead by a leader of the KKK, so there's that...
key word here: WERE. They're led by republicans now... so there's that.
And @SenatorIsakson @SenatorSessions are shining examples of that.
Sessions did as much for race relations as any black person other than MLK himself.
please, please for the love of all things holy explain to me why you think that? I'm curious?
Do you read? Do a bit of research and expand your mind. You might learn a few things.
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept You didn't listen to the majority of your constituents.
when is your townhall meeting in atl so u can hear ur own constituents?Time to lead &not be trumps puppet
It would be unfair to call Trump the biggest loser in America if it weren't true
Hope the law has such respect for him as well after such a track record. #SAD!
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept I'm sure his skills will be handy for suppresing civil rights per So Called Pres. 
you should be ashamed of supporting this racist. You will not be reelected in GA.  #shameonyou
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept Sad selection for America
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept wouldn't even show up at Town Hall. Balless wonder.
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept Johnny I did not vote for you this is why. Hurry God is waiting to judge you.
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept He's racist just like Trump. This can't be just & fair. Especially as AG.
you're delusional.
cool
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept You are an embarrassment to the people of Georgia.
Might want to get some chapstick for those ass kissing lips.
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept You starting to get the hang of the new working pace? Let's get this done! #MAGA
you need to start listening to us. We the people not we the party.
I've about had my fill of punks like you.
Just like Fab laundry detergent of the 50's, it makes whites whiter than white.
shame on you for voting to confirm an AG who doesn't believe in civil or voting rights.
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept We suspect Sessions will be a Trump/Putin puppet and set about destroying the USA
Senator Isakson - Can you please tell Mr. Sessions not to lie about crime statistics?
disappointed you did not listen to the people who elected you. Sessions NOT a good choice.
You sir will be voted out at the next election. You voted for a racist.
"Years" don't own dept. No apostrophe. Education is a great asset.  Ask @BetsyDeVos?
U mean the same law he blatantly abused before? OH!forgot, we don't talk about that
You are all nuts
Very happy Sen. Sessions is A. G.! America finally has someone who will enforce our laws.
too bad you once again refused to listen to your constituents. You backed a racist.
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept Bannon is the brains and 45 is the puppet #bannonspuppet #BannonIsPresident
yes that way you can suppress minorities for the  next four years
It's a good thing this one has some experience, unlike our #FakePresident
His rascist background should have excluded him. I question your ethics sir.
Total clown shown
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept thanks for supporting @jeffsessions    great pic so excited 4America
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept He appears that he is everything BUT respectable.  A bigot is unable 2 follow law.
Sen. Isakson when ate you going to have a town hall in Atlanta? Greensboro is FAR away!
@Way to go traitor, self-serving and racist.  You will be voted out next election for this and more.
Yes, he will be a fine AG! Congrats!
Yes Sr. He is the man...!!
Now I know who I am not going to vote for...
He's a disgrace to the office and @SenatorIsakson I'll remember your vote on Election Day.
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept  more like Great Asses!!!
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept Bigot says what?
His record with race relations, not so much.
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept 

Finally a men with guts to impose respect with not fear...!!
Opposition means we are doing great..!! Write?
You cannot denigrate the law and claim to have respect for it. Get out of here.
Thnx 4 supporting a regressive bigot for AG & making America a 3rd world autocracy.
Does his respect for law extend to the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act?
do you think Sessions will be able uphold the 14th Amendment even if it is own home state?
Since Alabama required driver's licenses and then shut down so many of its DMVs.
GREAT job, gentlemen! â€ 
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept your s disgrace to the great state of Georgia
Thanks you sir! You have done a good thing
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept can't wait to vote you out of office.

I hope you don't want to be re-elected.  I know about you now, and my memory is long.
Now if only #scalawags like isakson could have someone run against them for office.
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept  Great job!  Ensures the bigotry and racism of the GOP in perpetuity. Yay, 'Murica!
Bullshit.
I can't wait for the midterm elections I will never vote Republican again
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept Kleptocracy Klan Koronation.  KKK rally is alive & well #TheResistance
Another idiot speaks about @realDonaldTrump's success destroying USA. He loves it!
asking the public to buy Ivanka products is a clear violation of ethics rules
Let's pray that Sessions has learned tolerance and acceptance of ALL people.
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept Disgrace to all Scandinavians.
@POTUS @SenatorSessions As the trump White House crumbles remember Isakson's vote. Hold him responsible. Withhold support!
.@SenatorIsakson @Rowdy123Theresa @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept We LOVE Sessions. Trump is assembling a stellar cabinet. Thx for support.
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept - Respect as in "Separate, but equal?" Get those white robes dusted off gents!
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept big difference between respect for the law and respect for justice
Did you listen to your constituents and how they felt about Sessions before you voted?
So constituents mean nothing to you. Got it. Got it. 
Thanks for selling my special needs son's education & future to the highest bidder!
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept if you endorse a racist, you endorse racism.  Then you are a racist.
I'm disappointed and angry as someone who you are supposed to be representing. Take a stand for what is right.
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept @SenThadCochran racist USA emerges. Democrats 2018. Start now turn red states blue.
#Winning
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept old angry white guy!
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept Yeah way to go!
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept assets for racism and discrimination!
Thank you from Atlanta!
He is a racist, a sexist, and a practitioner of voter suppression. Your vote is shameful.
Fuck anything Trump wants done.
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept this is laughable.
30% increase in women dying in childbirth in Texas last year due to clinic closings!
Johnny Please hold a town hall meeting to discuss.
YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER THE OPPRESSION CAUSED BY SESSIONS SHAMEFUL! #midtermelections
Congrats indeed, and thank you!
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept You mean "ASS"??
You should be grateful you face no political risk until 2022 b/c the storm is coming that will wash away your backward ways
don't you think there's enough racism in the administration??  Open your eyes and hear your constituents!!
Another disappointment. Another name to reject at the ballot box.
@POTUS @SenatorSessions @TheJusticeDept pigs
what a shame.  Welcome to 1950
what about for Americans? He wants to take away civil rights for many! That's his "respect" for the law.
thanks for taking us back to the 1950s. But I guess since you're rich and white, the 1950s reference wouldn't mean much 2 U
his respect for the law?? Seriously?! This nom is a disgrace.
Shame on you Johnny. #ShePersisted
Put down the pipe please.
