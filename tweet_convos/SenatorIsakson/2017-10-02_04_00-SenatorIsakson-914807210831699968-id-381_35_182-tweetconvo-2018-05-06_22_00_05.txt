pass common sense gun control- no automatic weapons
Is the $3,500 NRA contribution you received in 2016 worth the lives of these individuals?

"Nearly half of all middle-class families would pay more in taxes in 2026."
 
Families can't afford the #GOPtaxbill. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/business/republican-plan-would-raise-taxes-on-millions.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news …

Are you going to vote yes on the silencer issue? Please respond here Senator, we that follow you want to know your position and reasoning
We need regulations on guns NOW! Please create them!!
is tainted.  They promise freedom ( already given) so that no 1 will see their unchecked power and profit. U r smarter than this.
Do your part for meaningful gun control NOW!!!
hypocrite!!!!
Please give back the $3500 you received from the NRA in the 2016 election cycle. And then stand up for sensible gun laws
Conservative President, Supreme Court, GOP Congress should all join together for practical gun control solutions
Your "prayers" for the horrific shooting are meaningless. YOU accepted $3,500 from the NRA in 2016. There is blood on YOUR hands.
No sane reason for semi- & automatic weapons. You need to be on the right side of history on this issue or deaths are on you & colleagues.
Is today a good day to talk about sensible gun control?
"First of all, you never accept the fact that you can [prevent mass shootings"  NO, WE can't because we have idiots like you in charge!
I've heard you speak, even met you once.  I think you are a good man and a leader.  I pray that you see that the NRA"s money
Enough is enough!We need sensible gun laws now!
Instead of praying, why don't you act by crafting common sense gun legislation??
The last round of thoughts and prayers haven't averted another horrific shooting / massacre. Learn from past mistakes or get voted out.
You, too,  can work to save lives if you stop taking NRA money and start taking a common sense approach to guns in this country.
DONOT  JUST talk about praying when YOU-are in a job where you CAN DO SOMETHING . LEGISLATE TO STOP GUN VIOLENCE NOW!!!!!!
$10,000 is what the NRA contributed to your re-election. Stop the hypocrisy and start supporting sensible gun control legislation.
What did you do to save others? Oh right, you accepted $3,500 from the NRA. YOU caused this. YOU'RE responsible for this senseless violence.
Georgia Senator Johnny Isakson received $3,500 from the #NRA during the 2016 election cycle. #thoughtsandprayers
America needs "saving" from you when you continue to take money from the NRA. Stop and take action now! Be a hero.
Prayers are nice but we need better GUN CONTROL NOW
One World One Nation One People under God and his Son Jesus unites us for eternity. That’s the Love we share...
Georgia Senator Johnny Isakson received $3,500 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle. #Hypocrite
I am praying that you & your colleagues stop taking NRA money & support gun control!
Every day, 91 Americans are killed by gun violence. @SenatorIsakson, we constituents demand common-sense gun laws. Vote NO on Bill 446!
How many more times do U have to pray for victims before U help prevent the shootings in the 1st place? We need #CommonSenseGunLaws
Can you tell us if you have received donations from the NRA and if so how much they donated? We need Senators for us not for the NRA.
Georgia Senator Johnny Isakson received $3,500 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
may you please also send the NRA their money back. thank you.
or better yet, donate it to save lives and support those affected.

I’m sure all that praying is gonna help prevent this from happening again Senator
Georgia Senator Johnny Isakson received $3,500 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
Pray for all the families, friends and loved ones affected by these tragedies. We are standing in love with you all...
Thoughts and prayers mean more if you follow through and vote for sensible gun laws and perhaps stopped accepting gifts from the NRA
And we are praying for all of you who are going to Hell for taking money from the NRA.
Love saved lives, so proud of the many that helped and risked their own lives to save others they didn’t know. United
Vote NO on #shareact
Don't make this another post Sandy Hook or post Orlando vote. CHANGE YOURSELF. You are in the Senate Majority. We are ALL your constituents.
I am a constituent.  Please use some courage and common sense and immediately bring forth strict gun control legislation. #GunContolNow
Our guns may protect your loved ones someday! Guns don’t kill people hate does. Need more good people with guns.
Faith and prayer without action is nothing but a thought. Keep this from happening again. Act through policy. Give the NRA back their $.
You took money from the NRA. Shame. Shame. Shame.
If you really cared for them, you would stop taking blood money from the NRA and work on gun reform.
My FREEDOM is in jeopardy when I can't safely be in public. I want the freedom to go to concerts, school, 2B in a crowd. #LasVegasShooting
Your prayers are not enough! We need #GunControlNow .  #howmanymore ??? Please DO something. I'm begging. #LasVegasShooting #gunreform
Your prayers won't help the victims of this or any future tragedy brought on by guns. Maybe bring forth legislation to fix the problem?
Maybe instead of praying you might try to enact laws that prevent this sort of thing. #BloodMoney #NRAsBitch
This shooting is on you. Grow a spine and do something for somone other than the NRA. 

Better yet, just resign.  You are a joke.
U have no right 2 pray 2 God in regards 2 those that lost their lives in Vegas! U have been paid by NRA 2 to ignore the massacres U created
$3,500
We see how hollow your prayers are, when your actions enable gun violence in this country. You are wasting your power to effect change.
What are you doing to enable sensible gun control? Nobody needs the weapons for personal use #GunControl
yet based on your own website, you clearly don't want to hear from anyone in regards to #GunControlNow
You accepted $3,500 from the NRA in the 2016 election cycle.
After 20 children were shot to death, you voted against regulation on assault rifles. Your prayers don't stand against your voting record.
You took $3500 from the NRA in blood money last year. That's roughly $55 per person that died in L.V. Sunday Think about that.
How about you pray with us that the GOP will stop putting the NRA first and will enact REAL laws that will protect Americans from guns?
Senator Johnny Isakson received $3,500 from the NRA
You should have thought about that before taking funds from the NRA during the last election cycle.
Your prayers are not enough.  Take action. Do something.
Your prayers and thoughts mean nothing. Ban assault weapons enact stricter gun laws.
Do something this time!
Action is what we need. Senator do your job and introduce gun restrictions that will prevent the next mass shooting.
Look @SenatorIsakson - you were on Jimmy Kimmel! Too bad it was for doing nothing after the last mass shooting. https://twitter.com/SenatorIsakson/status/914807210831699968 …
It's time to stop praying for the latest victims of another mass shooting, Stop taking money from the NRA and do something productive.
you owe more than your prayers. close gun loopholes. make it impossible for the mentally ill to access guns. this is on you.
Congerss should be prosecuted for MURDER for your inaction! Bought by the NRA
These deaths are on you.  You have repeatedly prioritized money over morals and couched it in "freedom".  Save your "thoughts and prayers"
pray for forgiveness from god as you assisted in the murder of 50 us citizens by taking money from the NRA. How do you sleep at night?
Horrific is YOU accepting $3500 from the NRA last year - that's about $6 per shooting victim this time, right?
Keep your prayers. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!
Those who can do something to prevent horrifying tragedies like this from happening again should act.  Children, music lovers, churches...
When you're done praying, get up and do something. Talk about #gunviolence. Make store owners to do the same.
You literally voted to give more guns to crazy people... What are you praying for? Another #MassShooting ? #HjRes40
NRA money? "Though you offer many prayers, I will not listen, for your hands are covered with the blood of innocent victims." Isaiah 1:15
Stop sadly wagging your head, taking money from lobbyists and making this worse. Fix it. (We know you're far too craven for that).
Prayers are nice, but if you won't do anything for gun control then don't repeal obamacare since future victims will need it. #GaPol
We’ll do the praying. You do something about the laws that enabled the killer. But you won’t because NRA pays your salary.
Enough prayers. Do something about gun control NOW!!!
Please we need electronic record tracking throughout US.  Ban on semi auto and automatic type guns.
But are you able to look yourself in the mirror and understand that YOU are part of the problem. The 2nd amendment is not in the Bible.
If all we do is prayer, there is blood on our hands.
You received $3500 from the NRA. You are part of the problem. Prayers are not enough, we need action.
Are you also praying no one notices you helped make this happen by accepting blood money from the NRA last year?  Talk is cheap, hypocrite.
Johnny Isakson received $3,500 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
What ACTIONS are you going to take to help prevent more of this in the future??? Huh???? #guncontrol

Every Member of Congress Who Took Money From the NRA and Tweeted 'Thoughts and Prayers' to Las Vegas @splinter_news http://ow.ly/9SsB30fAAVY 
Georgia Senator Johnny Isakson received $3,500 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.

As you can see anyone is capable of doing this horrific act now everyones a target.Change our gun laws before it happens here #LasVegas 
Yet you took $3,500 from NRA during 2016 for campaign contribution.  :'(
You bear responsibility in this and every shooting. Do something to protect those of us still alive and unharmed. You were too late for LV.
Let me fix this tweet for u: I will help pass #GunControl to save lives because one dead American due to gun violence is too many. #LasVegas
Back up your prayers with action on #guncontrol and refusal of NRA #bloodmoney. 270+ mass shootings this year. Lots of useless prayer.
You are complicit in voting not to extend the assault weapons ban. Return your NRA money, John. Show some integrity.
Maybe you can donate the $10,000 the NRA gave you to some shooting victims. Now how about voting AGAINST deregulating silencers?
So heartbreaking
BLOOD IS ON UR HANDS.
Pray for God's forgiveness when he judges you for you love of NRA money over people's lives.
POLICY helps. Tweeting "thoughts & prayers" and accepting $3,500 from NRA does not. Enough is enough! NOW is the time to talk about change.
The NRA bought your votes for $3,500; wonder if you see this as an appropriate cost for the death of 50+ American today. You are complicit.
You received $3500 from @NRA last year. How about a personal donation of $3500 to Red Cross?
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
#GunControlNow
#LasVegas
Their blood is on your hands.

time to pass strict gun laws. 2nd Amendment = right to own make and model available at time of constitution adoption.
Our nation does not need your prayers. They need your COURAGE to go AGAINST the gun lobby. Do you have what it takes or not?
Maybe you should take the $3,500 you got from the NRA and clean your #BloodStainedHands by paying for someone's medical bills. #GFY
Save your hollow prayers. The majority of Americans want  sensible gun    laws  but  you sold us out for a lousy $3,500 donation from the @NRA.  That's  less than $61 per human life lost in Vegas.
We're good with the prayers how about doing something constructive? #DoYourJob #guncontrol #SandyHook #LasVagas
So was the $3,500 you got from the NRA last election cycle worth it?
#prayersarenotenough! #dotherightthing - return #NRA $ and join the fight for #CommonSenseGunControl #LasVegasShooting
Georgia Senator Johnny Isakson received $3,500 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
Who voted against gun control? Joe and Mika read their names http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/who-voted-against-gun-control … #BloodOnYourHands
SMDH
How about let’s do more than pray for them.. you are in a unique position to effect change...

GUN CONTROL NOW.
Blood is on your hands for taking money and supporting terrorist @NRA
exactly what is NRA paying you for? Shame
Please use this to ban assault rifles from civilian sale - I know you  the NRA but civilians don’t EVER need assault rifles!!
We pray every time this happens. Prayers aren't working! WORK for sensible gun legislation!
House Poised to Pass Law Easing Sale of Gun Silencers After Las Vegas Shooting | Politics | US News
I am embarrassed that a Senator from the great state of Georgia took blood money  from the @NRA to advance his campaign.
horrific shooting, yet you still won't refuse @NRA money, will you? is $3500 worth the #bloodonyourhands?
