#FullRepeal of Obamacare, please.  That was the promise.  "Land of the free" does not mean subsidies. #KeepThePromise
The tweaks to Obamacare in the House are not even close to #FullRepeal. Stop this outrageous government overreach. #UnitedForFreedom
Senator, please remember your job is to protect and defend the Constitution and nothing less.

#FullRepeal not #FakeRepeal

Please change Trumpcare the biggest change it needs to the trash can. #fullrepeal #unitedforfreedom
Common sense=don't spend what we don't have & keep 7 year promise of #FullRepeal! Revert back to plans pre-ACA & get govt out of healthcare!
Federal gov't has no legitimate power to provide healthcare - will fail like VA

Yuck! Can not stand reading McKee's nonsense!
Can you please listen to your constituents about not repealing the  ACA?
Really Johnny? What part of common sense is this? #DoYourJob
Common sense spending like separate homes for Trump, and multiple golf dates? Security for wealthy adult kids?
Apparently you don't post your own tweets.  Do you read the responses?  Do you ask your staff about what your constituents say?  Lummox!
# Isakson has a pre-existing illness that he receives the best medical care offered. We pay 4 it. He will vote for letting us suffer & die.
@SenatorIsakson thinks that getting rid of the 3.8 Medicare surcharge is an across the board tax cut for everyone. That's just ignorant.
common sense budget:  You alignin w "leader" & "mob" who rep. 1% of USA. Reality: Your CONSTITUENTS who VOTE are 99% #TownHall
Common sense would be listening to your constituents whom u supposedly work for - Ind Comm to investigate Trump/RU!
Common sense? Must include cutting 45's vacays and not building the wall...
