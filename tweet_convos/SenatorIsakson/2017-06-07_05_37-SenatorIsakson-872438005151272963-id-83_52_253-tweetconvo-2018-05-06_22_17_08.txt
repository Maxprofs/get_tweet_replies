Vets are responsible for the destruction in the middle cesspool? Surely you jest?
Lol. Wonder how the world would've been had we The USA, not beat Hitler? Can you say "white fascist supremacy?"
AMERICA MILITARY RULES!
Federal gov't not authorized or capable of providing good health care
Free enterprise!

How about protecting whistleblowers @WhiteHouse? How can whistleblowers be guilty and the truth they uncover on @potus ignored by you, @GOP?
.@SenatorIsakson RT'd, so I'll park this here. He is blocking people who request a town hall. This is unacceptable.
Since you and other GOP refuse to move on any of Trumps corruption then all leakers are whistle blowers. You all are accomplices. Frauds.
Do tell, what corruptions?
Open your eyes sweetie, there I told you

Thank God Trump finally got the ball rolling after all these LOOOONNG years of vets suffering. Why didn't all of you do something sooner ???
You've been in Senate for 30+ yrs and never legislated much for VA. Thank God for @POTUS who led the way within first 100 days.
That's bull shit. McCain used to be great until he become so old now that he gets confused easily. Trump is a con artist and a crook.
Veterans cld benefit a lot if they could go to the doctors & hospitals of their choice. #FullRepeal of ACA & No to AHCA! #UnitedForFreedom!
#NoRinoTrumpcare! #RepealObamacareCompletely! #UnitedForFreedom!
You're an embarrassment to vets everywhere. You've ridden the 'POW' vet card long enough. We're over you. Resign. Today.
AHCA does NOTHING to make health care affordable, because  government not competent to do FREE MARKET'S job. #Full Repeal #UnitedForFreedom
#FullRepeal #KeepThePromise or we will send you home! Get govt out of our healthcare & stop acting like the left! No ACA & No Obamacare 2.0
The above Tweet is by you! So, I'd have to agree.
STAY OUT OF OUR HEALTHCARE OR YOU WILL BE FIRED!!!!
Try goin after obama 4 takin VA funds & givin them 2 the refugees
193000 collection notices to DISABLED Veterans, taking their ENTIRE INCOME, due to va mistakes. DO SOMETHING.
Soooo...MAKE THE VA QUIT BEING A COLLECTION AGENCY.
The American people want more whistle blowers. Someone needs to tell us what you guys in DC are doing.
We say this again @SenJohnMcCain is a coward and a traitor to our country. He is complicit and defends the interest of Vladimir Putin.
Where were you the last 8yrs while vets were dying? Just like the funeral for your shipmates on the Forrestal after the fire, Mccain Absent!
@Vets_Vs_Trump Now get Warren Davidson 2 pull his bill HR307 demanding Congress/Staff be covered under DeptVetAff.Only 18% served.HYPOCRISY!
Leave our VA. Health care alone you have screwed over us enough
PLEASE SEE YOUR INBOX! US AIRMAN ANDREW CARTER HAS 2 DAYS!!!! MAKE A CALL FOR HIM!
thank you Pres Trump
A pity we can't have a #Senateaccountability billâ€¦so we could hold corrupt actors accountable and protect America's integrity at home&abroad
Declare yourself as a Democrat b/c you are currently a traitorous Republican.

The Do Nothing Republicans NEED to stand by our President and do what the people have been voting for! #MAGA
Idiots that say that always crack me up.ha ha ha ha. Thanks for the belly laugh.
Don't take credit for something you had nothing to do with.
You did nothing for years and years and years! All the credit goes to @POTUS 
LMAO. Can you even chew gum and walk at the same time with that brain.
Senator McCain. When did we start using the Wash Post for intel.
The only one your after and trying to destroy is the POTUS.
Because he is the top con artist and crook. Get RID of him, the rest disperse.
@SenatorIsakson so there's no reason you can't hold a #TownHall or #DoYourJob & #ImpeachTrumpNow
What has taken so long? Also must make sure there's no misuse.
How about investigating Clinton Lynch since you're all so interested in who's influencing who !?!
This is a good step. It's too bad we can't just "fire" politicians on the spot when they are unethical. Not a dig on you @SenJohnMcCain
As a veteran I am proud of the Senate for doing this
Seems like something useful for a change from an #Obstructionist !
Sharon Helman is still there.  The culture is still about bonuses.  Depraved indifference to life for pursuit of wealth unaddressed.
Only took 20 plus years for you to get to it.
FIRE TO PPL WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE DEATH WAITLIST. QUIT BEING A  with @SecShulkin
When are you retiring? You home and buddy in Russia is waiting for you. Get out of Washington DC
Speaking of holding bad actors accountable some wonder Y the PPL of Az continue to give U a pass. U & @SenSchumer can cry #faketears 4 this.
I'm still waiting to see the hero here? what are you standing by and let Trump start a war with Qatar. To busy .
Kind of like you've done nothing to help them! You want money for weapons, not injured servicemen and women!
That's great @SenJohnMcCain 
Now, how about saving the rest of us? When will you decide it's enough?
I beg you Sir, stand up & speak out!!
He can't. Unfortunately his reasoning abilities are a thing of the past.
Sadly, nothing being done now, right here and now, to fulfill our obligation to care for Vets today, nothing
We hear from time to time US citizens don't have an appetite for war. Imagine how the people who have been bombed for the last 50yrs feel.
Good Wednesday Morning, Sen. John McCain of ARIZONA
Glad your happy John what a relief
Finally done something don't stop now this is a drop in the bucket of what you could and should be done
How about holding Trump accountable? Outrage and complicity isn't action John.  Do the Russians have dirt on you too?  Where's the-maverick?
Are you going to hold our president accountable?
Yes,
For saving this country. 
I respect McCain and appreciate his service. Your profile says drain the swamp. Ignorance is a correctable condition but stupid is forever.
Hold 45 accountable. Please.
Prouder that Trump initiated it. Your leadership sucks
This business will get out of control. It will get out of control and we'll be lucky to live through it.
#HuntForRedOctober
Thank you, Senator. Go big. Encourage the 25th Amendment to save us all the frightening days ahead with a madman in chg.
You're the bad actor

Senator, will you unequivocally condemn today's apparent terrorist attacks in #Tehran? Will the leader of your party? #GOP #IranAttacks
He did and iran scoffed @ him. Y do u ppl put me in a position 2 defend trump? U only hurt urselves. I didn't even vote 4 the guy.
I am worried about the 10,000 America troops in Oatar and Trump throwing them under the bus for Saudi .Any one care
Good job. Now it's time to get the crazy man out of the White House before he gets us all killed.
Did that in November hun
