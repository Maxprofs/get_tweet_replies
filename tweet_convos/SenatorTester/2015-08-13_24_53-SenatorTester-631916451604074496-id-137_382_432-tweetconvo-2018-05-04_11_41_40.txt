@SenatorTester Diplomatic deference to belligerents still leads to war. http://shoebat.com/2015/04/05/you-were-given-the-choice-between-war-and-dishonor-you-chose-dishonor-and-you-will-have-war/ … #IranDeal
@SenatorTester Willfully ignoring that @TheIranDeal is all too similar to the #MunichAgreement.
@SenatorTester @owillis @TheIranDeal  Thank you Senator.
@SenatorTester @TheIranDeal @SenatorJoe Donnelly Listen to a senior senator who is not afraid to lead.
@SenatorTester @owillis @TheIranDeal exactly correct, senator.

@SenatorTester @PrettyFootWoman @TheIranDeal THANK YOU SIR! There should  be no debate #LetDiplomacyWork
@SenatorTester @TheIranDeal its unreal that an educated person like yourself can truly believe that this deal will stop Iran #nodeal
@SenatorTester Thank you, Senator for choosing peace over war. @TheIranDeal
@SenatorTester Thank you for supporting #IranDeal #LetDiplomacyWork #IBackObama
@SenatorTester Thank you. Now please convince @SenSchumer how wrong he is on this issue.
@SenatorTester @WhiteHouse @TheIranDeal:When we look back 50 years from now,the world will recognize Obama as one of the greatest Presidents
@SenatorTester @WhiteHouse @TheIranDeal
@SenatorTester @WhiteHouse I currently disagree. Can you spell out how in an article?
@SenatorTester @TheIranDeal
Another Congressional Democrat Will Vote No on the #IranDeal: Congressman @BradSherman  http://www.jewishpress.com/uncategorized/another-congressional-democrat-will-vote-no-on-the-iran-deal/2015/08/09/ …
@SenatorTester @TheIranDeal Another puppet to your Master Obama! Coward!
@SenatorTester @ChrisMurphyCT @TheIranDeal Well said, Senator Tester. That other option won't get many volunteers for combat.
@SenatorTester @TheIranDeal Good for you Senator
@SenatorTester @TheIranDeal You are a stand up guy. Thanks for choosing peace by supporting the Iran Deal.
@SenatorTester @TheIranDeal 
Thanks Senator. All of the world including we Iranians will appreciate your decision. You helped making history
@SenatorTester @TheIranDeal If it were me I would want as many inspectors as I could get in Iran. I support deal.
.@POTUS Kudos to @SenatorTester for supporting @TheIranDeal. cc @VP  @marieharf @JohnKerry @vj44
@ManUpUAll @POTUS @SenatorTester @TheIranDeal @VP @marieharf @JohnKerry @vj44 Smart decision senator....thank you!
@SenatorTester @ChrisMurphyCT @TheIranDeal YOUR NOTHING BUT RUBBER STAMP FOR OBAMA. YOU HAVE LESS BALLS THAN HILLARY
@Dymodon @SenatorTester @ChrisMurphyCT @TheIranDeal and that's what retards say.  Thank you for your intelligence!
@SenatorTester @WhiteHouse @TheIranDeal thank you for your thoughtful deliberation on this @senatortester
@SenatorTester @marieharf @TheIranDeal Good to see the MT people continue to be Mis-represented by Tester. How much did the DNC kick in?
@SenatorTester @billingsgazette @TheIranDeal Are you nuts?
@SenatorTester @TheIranDeal Thank you for your courage, Senator!
@SenatorTester @WhiteHouse @TheIranDeal..if there is any, what is your logic?
@SenatorTester @TheIranDeal thanks thanks thanks! #NoWarWithIran
@senatortester @theirandeal "thoughtful deliberation" probably means a twisted arm by a big guy with a baseball bat and the cry "uncle"
@SenatorTester @WhiteHouse @TheIranDeal Doesn't stop, only slows but nice try. And is worthless since Iran's President is not the final say
@SenatorTester @WhiteHouse affirmative.
Nobody logrolls @SenatorTester; This is reassuring. @TheIranDeal
After thoughtful deliberation, it’s clear @TheIranDeal is the only option right now to stop #Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.
Thank you @SenatorTester for your hindsight and the courage to follow through. @TheIranDeal. #IranDeal
@SenatorTester @WhiteHouse @TheIranDeal well tester it's final.  Your a damn idiot.
@SenatorTester @WhiteHouse @TheIranDeal Thank you senator. #courage #intelligence
@SenatorTester @WhiteHouse @TheIranDeal Thoughtful deliberations (followed by action) are essential to the healthy functioning of US Gov. :)
@SenatorTester @WhiteHouse @TheIranDeal If ever Iran does get nukes and uses them, we still have the option to wipe them off the Earth.
@SenatorTester @WhiteHouse @TheIranDeal thank you, Sen Tester, for putting America's interests first.
@SenatorTester @WhiteHouse @TheIranDeal Without it, they could get nukes anyway. At least we get some access now.
@SenatorTester @WhiteHouse @TheIranDeal   Well, that makes sense.  We do whatever we can to prevent war and the loss of life.
@SenatorTester @WhiteHouse @TheIranDeal. This must be a joke, you can't be serious.
@SenatorTester @WhiteHouse @TheIranDeal Of course it is. @POTUS says if we don't take deal, they will be bombing places in 6 months or less.
@SenatorTester @WhiteHouse @TheIranDeal Party over intelligence. You go guy.
@SenatorTester @WhiteHouse @TheIranDeal I'm just a mom, but even *I* can see that's insane. Shame on you.
@SenatorTester @WhiteHouse @TheIranDeal the lessons of history are obviously lost on the Democrats.
@senatortester @theirandeal I strongly agree with you.The truth is that we can't predict with accuracy the end of such a war.
@SenatorTester @TheIranDeal @WhiteHouse right on...what else can we do?
@SenatorTester @WhiteHouse @TheIranDeal good choice senator. Thx 4 ignoring all d noise frm doz who want wars. @SenSchumer u wrong man...
@SenatorTester @WhiteHouse @TheIranDeal It's foolish to negotiate/deal with those who repeatedly state they want to destroy you.
@SenatorTester @WhiteHouse @TheIranDeal there's no real chance of ever stopping them just slow them down for awhile
@SenatorTester @TheIranDeal Thank you Senator Tester.  Don't follow the neocon charge into endless war and enmity.
@SenatorTester @WhiteHouse @TheIranDeal We will remember what u said when Iran has a nuke #Tool
@SenatorTester @TheIranDeal Sit, Ubu. Sit.

Good dog.
@SenatorTester @TheIranDeal Iran deal has been worldwide accepted except warmongers. World wants peace.
@SenatorTester @WhiteHouse @TheIranDeal cuz if we don't as Kerry said, the US currency will no longer be the reserve currency of the world
Have another drink.... @SenatorTester @theirandeal
@SenatorTester @clrson5 @TheIranDeal please tell me this is a parody account of some sort.
@SenatorTester @TheIranDeal Only dweebs run out of options. What is this? 4th grade?
@SenatorTester @WhiteHouse Thank you
.@SenatorTester .@WinWithoutWar .@TheIranDeal Thank You senator!
@SenatorTester @WhiteHouse @TheIranDeal THOSE BİGGOT RACE&RLGN ENEMY USGOV WHO UNİTED WİTH THE BİGGOT CALİFORNİA,AUTHORS&RAPED ALL MYRIGHTS
@SenatorTester @TheIranDeal if its not accepted then even war can't be possible
@iamrahulaus @SenatorTester @TheIranDeal what?
@SenatorTester @TheIranDeal You had the choice between war and dishonor. You chose dishonor- so you shall have war. #Leadership
@ballGame89 @SenatorTester @TheIranDeal unnecessary war is the most dishonorable
@supremeSeldinho @SenatorTester @TheIranDeal War is coming either way. Better it to not be a nuclear one, agree?
@ballGame89 @SenatorTester @TheIranDeal there won't be a war if this deal is enforced
@supremeSeldinho @SenatorTester @TheIranDeal Israel will act as soon as they cheat (which is a guarantee) and it will be military force
@ballGame89 @SenatorTester @TheIranDeal Israel won't act against Iran.  If Israel was going to act, they would've done it already.
@supremeSeldinho @SenatorTester @TheIranDeal oh they'll act. As soon as Iran is on the verge. They're not pussies, unlike Obama.
@ballGame89 @SenatorTester @TheIranDeal they're also not reckless. They know they can't win every fight
@SenatorTester Dupe.

 @marieharf @TheIranDeal
@JohnBurtner @SenatorTester @marieharf @TheIranDeal We thank you Senator. The people are behind you, but not traitors at AIPAC.
@SenatorTester @TheIranDeal I am agree with you
@SenatorTester @marieharf @TheIranDeal Way to go Senator. You choose party over country, and we will all pay dearly. #Leadership
@ballGame89 @SenatorTester @marieharf @TheIranDeal We all paid dearly for George W Bush lying about WMDs and the Iraq war.
@SenatorTester @marieharf @TheIranDeal after careful deliberation it's clear that @SenatorTester is a idiot obama zombie
@SenatorTester @marieharf @TheIranDeal so naive 2 trust that Iran will honor anything. It just befuddles me. This is what a comm orgzer does
