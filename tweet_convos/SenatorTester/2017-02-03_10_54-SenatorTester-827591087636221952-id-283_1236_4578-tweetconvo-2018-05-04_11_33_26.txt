#DeVosvote #devos #DeVosFacts
Thank you. Sadly @SteveDaines will stand with his 3 primary constituencies. Abject loyalty to party, to power and to money.
Thank you!!
we have a constitutional republic--not democracy which is mob rule--you ppl have kept ppl undereducated just for votes
Thank you for speaking up for public education and opposing DeVos.
Do you know if @SenatorTester is scheduled to speak again during #holdthefloor?
I don't know. Maybe his website still posts his daily schedule ?
Good idea to check. I see the last update was yesterday w/ nothing scheduled.
Jon she's not taking away public education - she's improving it. It's a failure. Not something to be proud of. Your adorable.
Thank you Sen.Tester.
thank you Jon! 
Thank you!!
THANK YOU.
Thank you You truly represent Montana values
I am pro de vos!
thank for standing up. It is so disheartening to think Steve Daines is abandoning Montana's children for party loyalty
Thank you for standing up for the American people. Our kids deserve better! America deserves better! Thank You!! #noDevos
@BetsyDeVos @VP @GovernorBullock 
.
Show Betsy and other States the Montana education successes. 
.
@BetsyDeVos @GovernorBullock
.
Now Senator Tester, visit & show DeVos how well Montana education works! GHS,FHS,FairmontEgan
@TinaLiebling You lost.  Get ready to Drain the Public Education Union Swamp
thank you!
as former teacher,  Betsy Devos is desperately needed to break pattern of failing schools. Please support her nomination.
You r my constituent.  Thank you for  #HoldTheFloor against DeVos.   Let's fight 4 what right
.
Why not disband Fed Dept Education and revert all those regs, funds, control to the States? Then increase teacher pay!
.
But that isn't what DeVos is gonna do. She wants full privatization
.
Maybe. Or, better she give all control to States, Counties, Communities and Parents
.  Thank you, Jon! Hopefully you & the other good guys can stop DeVos from being confirmed!
Thank you for voting no on DeVos.
thank you from a fellow Montanan, special education teacher, & mom!!!
Reply to @SenatorTester thank you Senator. Please sway others. DeVos not qualified. Her prospective policies will harm MT rural schools
Thank you for protecting our public schools w/NO vote for DeVos! You can not find one educator who is for her.
thank you
Thank you, Sir!
thank you, I hope @SteveDaines joins you in our fight for montanas children

@SenateDems Thank you from North Carolina

Education must be freed from people in power who have never worked in a classroom. Children have paid the price.
thank you
Thank you for your courage.  Put a person (senator?) with first hand knowledge of what goes on in schools in that position.
Thank you

(4 a shameless profiteer. Don't let our country be dependent on other countries for well educated researchers + workforce.
Thank you. We see you. We see your commitment to education and to children! Thank you!
(3 companies will profit off of the destruction of our kids future. Put money into the schools, invest in our children, not
(2 in our country. You don't throw something away that you can never get back. DeVos doesn't care about our kids, her

Thank you!!
@p_staatz  Great!!
Thank you Senator. I hope your message reaches across the aisle to a couple of your @GOP colleagues.
You are right of course, but looking at the way they are going, I wonder if Trump's team might be doing that on purpose.
@TheNotoriousNME Thank you Senator! Now how about Portman? We The People are Demanding a No on DeVos!

Thank you Senator for standing up for Public Education and getting it funded properly.

I disagree! Private Catholic Education is the best!
So can the rest of us get by w/out relevant experience/education? Maybe do away w/applications for work period?

Dolores Umbridge in the flesh.

@SenateDems DOWN WITH BETSY DEVOS. It's against the law to BUY a cabinet seat.

good!
, as a native Montanan, I admire your genuineness. Keep making us proud. Country over partisanship!
thank you, sir. I look forward to hosting you sometime at the Billings Public Library.
Ask Joh Tester why 45.3% of Americans will pay no Fed income tax for 2016! Is it because they have great educations & jobs?
Perhaps because some are tax cheats like POTUS?
Think about what a *privatized* system looks like: profit & the best interest in the shareholder
Thank You Sen.Teser we appreciate your conviciton for Public Schools! @BadassTeachersA @NYSAPE @garfield_paula
Jon Tester has just lied to the American People! America ranks 17th in reading & science & 25 in math in developed countries!
It's not like he's known for telling the truth, well only if it suits his interests.
