but wait....isn't this what rural america voted for? NOBODY wants a repeal without a LEGITIMATE, WORKING replacement.
the replacement won't be worth the paper it's written on! They'll gut the crap out of it.
how do you know that? Have you seen it?
well Cindy as a matter of fact your right! The replacement doesn't exist.
they have 70 similar versions that they are currently trying to agree on the best.At least they r working togter to find the best
@SenSchumer I am rural America.What we can't afford r high prem which quadrupled since 2012 as well as high deductibles
if you don't mind me asking how much do you pay per week? I would like to compare.
my wife$myself monthly prem is now 1,998.00 our deductable is 7500.00 each will pay 32k b4 ins kicks in
That is a lot. We only pay $600. Month and pay $50 each visit/ $1000 each hospital visit. Thank you.
the big problem is, is that prices vary so much depending on where you live.
I'm learning that. Crazy high prices.
you are absolutely wrong.

but you voted against Bernie's thingy because you take big Pharma $. #shill #corrupt #demexit #progressives
So $2000+ a month for 3 people is okay with you?
your right two grand a month is to much. But when millionaires and billionaires make the rules that's peanuts.
@LizDean8 Yet they voted against their own self-interest! This city dweller who has lots of medical options has no sympathy.
stupid people do stupid things.
well they effn voted for it... wtf!!
Right? Not w/o Dems fighting 'em on it. Gotta keep fighting!
Doctors and Nurses provide health care, not insurance companies. #ACA mandate is like mafia demanding $ for "protection".
#ACA mandates we buy overpriced insurance with high deductibles or be at the mercy of IRS benevolence come tax time.
wevwre so proud of you for standing up for Montanas and all of our citizens who rely on susidized health care.
@SenSchumer Since apparently the only people we're supposed to have any empathy for are rural whites, maybe this will stick
pretends like people who needed care were dying and piling up outside emergency room doors before the #ACA. 
It's fantasy.
So sick of the lot of you.Meds made in Canada are 100% safe & u know it.Enjoy your taxpyr funded hlthcare & pharma $.For now.
Beautiful!  Thank you!
Thank you
Thank u for fighting for the ACA!
but you voted no on the Klobuchar amendment. Why?
Sir, it is no longer a dangerous path. ACA saved 1000s of lives ea yr, they are now murdering 1000s & applauding it
Thank you for sharing. So sad you were not heard 
I herd that ?
Last night you voted against us.
with you in Superior, MT. Thank you Senator Tester
We also can't afford many of the prescription drugs we need, but you don't seem to care about that. Hypocrite.
but you can vote against importing cheaper drugs from Canada?
You rock
then why did you vote against @SenSanders Rx legislation?
So you are willing to let people die for this? So sad and we will make it a mission to stop any of you from being elected.
thank you!!! I appreciate you speaking up for the good of our country!
has marched in lock step with the worst president in American history. What do the Dems have on you? Maybe big pharma gotcha
Amen Senator Tester, to ROLLING UP the SLEEVES and gettting to work on ALL of your long overdue requests for action!!!!
All talk. When it comes to action, your #BigPharma vote speaks louder than words. WE WILL REMEMBER! #Cowards #FAIL
I cannot afford my medication ,or to go to a doctor,can I have your health plan?that what I thought
d'you know RAND PAUL even voted for the cheaper drug import plan? 12 Repubs did, and you & 13 FAKE DEMOCRATS ruined it all
You are going to get primary challenged for this and you are going to lose. Montanans don't want a pharma sellout loser.
then why the fuck did you vote against importing cheaper pharma drugs?! so disgusted by your turncoat vote. sold Montana out!
I can't afford to pay it. So my family goes without. Plus I'm going to get fined cause I can't afford it.
@SenSchumer That's a lie, they don't even have the coverage due to cost. Stop lying
Could you please explain why you voted against Senator @BernieSanders amendment, then?
Why did you sell us out and vote against the @BernieSanders amendment to lower drug prices? Do you have no backbone?
@SenSchumer well done Senator Tester! Don't repeal!! We need health care!!
why did you vote against cheaper drugs from canada? shameful.
So last night you vote for high drug prices. We could have had our drug prices drop to Canadian prices.
@whitewatercrew Which is what they should have done in the 1st place. Instead Dems gave Corn Husker kickback & we got ACA.
Thank you! Glad we have one senator we can count on.
Thank you for supporting health care for all.
Go get them http://Senator.You  tell tell them STUPID Idiots where it's at. I know you can rally more DEM's behind you.Thank you.
If you actually believe this, then why did you vote against @SenSanders Pharmaceutical bill?
, thank you!
.@SenatorTester So you're concerned about affordable healthcare? Why did you vote against @BernieSanders amendment to control drug prices?
@SenSchumer Healthcare should be our right! The people want it on both sides! Fight for our rights!
why did you vote against Bernie's prescription drug amendment??
thank you! Please keep up this fight!
Supported you since start. We've chatted often in Missoula. With this vote, you lose that support.
We can't afford our medications. Please explain your outrageous vote with GOP AGAINST affordable Rx!
obviously you do not  pay for your health plan-costs have tripled deduct huge lost plan and DOC how good is that!
Me too! I'm paying way  too much for insurance & I still don't go to the doc when I should due to bad coverage & deductibles!
Wow! Your honesty is refreshing!
@SenSchumer so now that you're the minority, you want input? You've done nothing to improve. Now you employ scare tactics
@SenSchumer it's a no brainer(but not easy) take control away from ins and pharm companies, they control it all
@SenSchumer Nuclear option hurts when it used to ram legislation down your throats eh?
@SenSchumer thank you. If only the GOP would listen. This is going to be a very rough time for most Americans.
- No one can. @vickscan
If you care about real people, you should have voted for Senator Sander's prescription drug price amendment.
@SenSchumer Now you want to work with Republicans on healthcare. Too late, We The People have spoken.
thank you for speaking out against leave us out in the cold without anyway to pay for health care- #WhatsAtRisk
Thank you, Senator Tester.
Please keep fighting, @SenatorTester. Montana is counting on you. #ACA #mtpol
Thank you.
Thank you.
thank you Senator, from a rural http://westerner.you  are correct.our rural hospitals and clinics can't either.
@SenSchumer my daughter got charge 90$ for a 3 min phone call to the doc to ask about medication
@SenSchumer i seen a neurologist for 10 mins for 500 cash and he just said i doubt theres any thing wrong
@SenSchumer   Doctors high rates are the cause of Ins and Hospitals outrageous rates
@SenSchumer anyone making less than 50,000 a yr doesnt want to pay premiums for insurance. They like to pay elec bill 1st
ALL America can not afford health care repeal.  Thank you for standing with all of US.
thank you, Senator! City folks can't afford repeal either!
@SenSchumer No they cant afford ACA in its current state.. a state you on the left caused!
@SenSchumer wow you are quite the liberal.
its a dead horse/sinking ship!!!
Unfortunately only dems and independents want to work to make things better. Republicans want to trash things.
@SenSchumer Cannot afford ACA either.
@SenSchumer Rural America can't afford what your selling. High premiums for high deductible policy is not health care.
@SenSchumer i agree with you
@SenSchumer we can't afford this half assed system you put in place
Thank you!!
@SenSchumer Thanks Senator Tester.  Love you for your honesty.
when Obamacare kicked in the cost of my health care more than tripled. We absolutely can afford to repeal and rethink.
thank you Senator!!
dooesn't need to be repealed...needs tweeking...as with SS, medicare, medicare, etc.
Thank you Senator Tester
@SenSchumer Bravo
Nice crops. Be a shame if a cow kicked over a lantern 
@SenSchumer is your party more important than people.  Learn to read facts & #wk4theppl
no they cannot. Thank you.
@SenSchumer then why did they choose the candidate who ran on taking it away from them? They chose this outcome..
Thanks for trying
@SenSchumer Exactly!!! Stop the partisan crap and do the right thing.  Thank you senator.
Folks all across America care. They need to know that Obamacare and ACA are the same. Sadly, too many don't know.
@SenSchumer and NOW UR ASKING FOR BIPARTISANSHIP? In 09 u did what? U treat ppl the way u want 2 B treated...
@SenSchumer the plan should be better not worse. Medicare works add healthy people, powerful buying power!
@BadASSSery Aren't they the idiots that want to repeal it in the 1st place? And stuck us with the orange pig?
Thank you...real people rely on the many parts of the ACA.
Thank you Senator!
Rural Americans need a case of Pabst Blue Ribbon, not healthcare. Maybe a little education, too. But that costs too much.
@Raizakolia Many people could get off several drugs simply by making simple exercise and lifestyle choices...
