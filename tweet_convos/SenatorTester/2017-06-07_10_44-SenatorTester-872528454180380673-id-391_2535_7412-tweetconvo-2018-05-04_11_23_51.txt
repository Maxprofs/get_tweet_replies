Senate passed the VA Accountability Act. The House should get this bill to my desk ASAP! We can’t tolerate substandard care for our vets.
Exact! #MAGA #DoTheRightThingGopOrElse #NeverDemAgain
Even the Captain of the Titanic had a loyal  crew!!
Yes. Applied to modern times, Obama & Hillary were the captain & 1st mate. Their crew is lost without them (and becoming delusional to boot)
Hey Sharon,  I guess that's what artists do - they make shit up.  LOL
Who are you talking to? See...delusional.
Thank you, Sir
Thank you Mr. McCarthy and to your colleagues for working with this VA Accountability Act. #MAGA
You guys need to start racking up some victories. Even if they are trivial low hanging fruit. A bunch of noncontroversial things would help
Thank you for getting on that right away.We need more men like you
Imagine. We have to fight for Vets, but illegal criminals get it all. Sad. #MAGAforAllTheHonorableCitizens
We don't trust you.  When we see it we will believe it if youndknt give it to Saudi, Russia or diverted the to a Trump org @POTUS
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Thank You!
This McCarthy guy has a bright future
The American people are paying attention..some of us are taking notes...
getting things done...yeah
Thank you @GOPLeader 
Signed sealed delivered then you can get vacation ' do it ! Get to work !
Have all the bills the house has passed sent to senate!  GET THEM DONE!!
Passing a Bill is a mere token gesture to We the People. Funding a bill and having ACCOUNTABILITY for failures & to Vets, that's real.
An did u serve....we know our idiot in chief did not
Better sent it King Putin first, since Republicans decided they will support whoever has the bucks
The veterans choice program is still slow as ever'
Great! Now start defending @realDonaldTrump
except when we are social security age and you want to take necessary benefits away from us. hypocrite!!
After this is done which I applaud ! Can you get tax cuts and Healthcare please and no August break if you can't ! We need this and we are
Increased funding, increased staffing, increased access?
But Trump can tolerate stealing from vets, cheating them, lying to them.
Sitting here waiting patiently we are fed up with slow moving GOP you want vacation give us what meets our needs and that's POTUS agenda
Waiting and waiting 8 years too long ! You all need roller skates or cases of Red Bull so you can keep up with the POTUS but we aren't
Get the Healthcare & Tax Cuts Done GODDAMIT!!!!!
Thank you Mr Potus.
Amen.#MAGA
@stephenkruiser @realDonaldTrump I can support this move!!! #Veterans
THANK YOU
I agree Rep McCarthy, they have Waiting long Enough!
fire them all and start over
Thank you sir!
 Let's get this DONE! 
We Vets only ask for what we earned. The BEST would definitely be icing on the cake, and appreciated.
Liars, traitors, thieves!!
Now THAT is efficient  & fast work from the legislature !
Congrats !
You don't mind substandard care for the rest of your fellow citizens!
Congrats on writing a great house tweet! http://greathousetweets.measuredvoice.com/GOPLeader/status/872509478469500931 … (Ranked 28th for Jun 7.)
Does it apply to vets who were captured???  @realDonaldTrump doesn't like those vets....he SAID so.
This is great!! However we need more results on everything !!!  I need healthcare , taxes done not Russia or comey all day long
good because we expect out elected officials to get Trumps agenda done  #CongressDoYourJob
From the wife of a Veteran: You are awesome!
Except, according to Trump, POW's because they are cowards for getting caught.
Finally some action time all this hands tying by obstructionist Dems of our President was stopped!
Plz fix the retirement pkg RE: Tricare.   Way too expensive for NCO and under on their retirement pay.
Good job, Mr. McCarthy!  MAGA!
That is AWESOME!!! Let's continue to move forward. We, the people are waiting for good things to happen!! Go Congress! 
But if we fail to reform the courts, liberal judges will just mandate that we keep poorly performing VA workers
Surprisingly U use the term #MAGA!? I remembered u rn't 4 Trump. A message 2ur colleague Steve Knight: Standing w/@POTUS otherwis

Whatever happened to the idea that vets should have a VA card they could take to a private healthcare provider? Instantly solves VA issues..
The REPUBLICANS ignore Traitor Trump leaking Classified Information which ENDANGERS our active duty military. Leaked location of our subs.
"Our vets deserve the best." -- Yet it took until Trump elected that anythig is being done.
Love the conversation you denied having about Putin paying Traitor Trump. But oopsy, there's a tape. It's pretty clear you weren't joking.
The two of you have a way to communicate other than Twitter, right?
Nice job and 20 years past due. But better late than never..
Arrest Comey for his admitted crimes. What a scum bag! Confused, seriously Jim? How convenient, pathetic!
Lets go & protect our Vets, fulfill promises to them @potus @realDonaldTrump #MAGA #MASA #TrumpTrain #DTS #BuildTheWall
Get your butts working on Healthcare & Taxes!!!
This is exactly what we want to see! GOP action that reflect our values, not the liberal tripe pushed by the dems. #SenateGOP #MAGA
Please repeal the Obama Sequestering it is harming Vets AND their children and spouses.
@realDonaldTrump How long have you held office? Next Tuesday? Too little too late. Our Vets do deserve the best.
What's the delay? Why next week? Why not today, Friday, or Monday? #NoAugustRecess @realDonaldTrump make them stay. Shame them!
This message was brought to you by Twitter.  No TV, no newspaper or talking head required!
Excellent example of bipartisanship. Way to stand up a steal the accolades. Won't see that again.
This is called being about the people's business.
No desk, budget cuts due to high softwood prices.
Great now help the prez build the wall and cut taxes....
Aren't you on VACATION next week?  Not happy with the INACTION....
Thanks!
The reason that the VA is substandard is because the GOP keeps screwing with it because the GOP is greedy.
thank you Kevin and thank you @potus!
So why are you limiting their healthcare options??
Thank you
Thank you for your reply @GOPLeader America needed that. We need more public replies to @POTUS . Truth.
Our President knows what priorities are. Congress are Dopes. And that ugly Al Green was embarrassed on TV. Couldn't look up at camera.Liar
THANK YOU  KEVIN MCCARTHY!!!!       Let's #MAGA       I  HOPE YOU CAN ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO BE A LETS GET THINGS DONE CONGRESS
Knowing that there has never been a Republican Bill that didn't favor the rich and/or hurt the poor - what's the BS Factor on this VA ACCT?
Love these kinds of tweets from our elected officials and especially our CD-R in Chief!
Yes they do so hurry up the endless vacation is coming up
I have no respect for you @GOPLeader. Get behind our POTUS and stay there !
Now How Bout Getting a Move on Supporting the @Potus 100%,  TAXES And the Wall !!!
Great news Congressman McCarthy!Thanks for the update!
Thank you!!
@realDonaldTrump  so this is how the new government works, you tweet the president about what you are going to do in congress? SAD
But I suppose the only way to get him to read it is in 140 characters or less! If he wants pictures then he can watch Fox News
@realDonaldTrump thank you
How but getting a move on Healtcare, Taxes and the Wall!!!!
@GreatAmericaPAC #ComeyDay #ComeyHearing #ComeyTestimony
You would be surprised how easy you get reelected when you actually get something done!
Thank you Kevin for supporting our President. He is great, God bless him and all that help him.
@PressSec agree our Vets deserve the best& so do all US, so please get HEALTHCARE Done NOW.Do it for US people not your re-elect!
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump   EXCELLENT!
TRUMP ASKED COMEY FOR LOYALTY TO HIS POLICIES IMMIGRATION ETC
Please address the Veterans who have been struggling to get their Service Connected disabilitiy claims appeals approved. Veterans deserve it
@realDonaldTrump thank you sir 
Dragging our feet are we?  You should be on this today and have it to @POTUS by Friday!  Slackers!

This is insane, what show boating my God what has happened to our government, everyone needs stroking, OMG McCarthy!  You suck up

Suck up.
 how gov of the people, for the people and by the people should work
Give our wonderful VETS choice. Shut down the VA!
Page 151 takes benefits away from Veterans.  What will be done about that?
Since you and the Republicans support this bill. I am positive it hurts veterans.

Let's all remember what Comey said about Hillary there was no intent so intense is the key word here I would think
Right On!
So they get single payer healthcare. And America get the we are working on it! U guys told us what u wanted and we voted. 2018 is coming.
You have no idea how grateful I am. My husband & I & 2 sons are Veterans. My husband is ill with lupus, kidney failure & aplastic anemia. 

Good God, did Congress actually do something?
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump  We The People voted for Trumps AgendaPaul Ryan needs to get on board. #Wall it was Passed in 2006

Bravo!  They deserve more than we can give! But this is a great start
Now get busy with health care. Tx reform.infastructure. and jobs, also immigration
Have a lot to do &short time to do them#MAGA
u probably need a Veteran panel 2 overlook your work & go after DAV, VA, & WEED OUT SHITBAGS!!!
MAGA!!!
Josh Earnest said that everyday he understood the gratitude he had to serve the American People. I have NEVER seen your gratitude.
Ass-kisser.
We the People are expecting ALL of the GOP House & Senate to do their jobs. Get behind our President & move his agenda forward.
Amen
Thank you!!! #MAGA

See what happens when you do things the right way and follow the Constitution...
Thank you to @POTUS @realDonaldTrump and @GOPLeader!

This is great news Leader McCarthy!

Amen-oldest son VA Administrator-must clean up Islamists working within VA-is terrible & particulars extremely troubling-cannot be let go!
Cancel August Recess
What? You expect them to actually work on something besides filling their own coffers?

Nice teamwork, gentleman! Thank you
