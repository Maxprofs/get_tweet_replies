bc republicans have been systematically destroying it from the inside for decades. #nevertrump
Those statements are all true, she has no background in public education on any level.Also troubling to me is the attached:
don't post memes w/o sources sited. @realDonaldTrump gave u that respect during campaign, u should show the same.
This info isn't a secret....just Google it yourself.
BUT I understand the fear or backlash she's getting for unsuitability
@j_smithcameron FWIW, she's not familiar with problems of primarily urban education settings, either.
She had no clue about IDEA.  Very unqualified.  #Inauguration
@SenSchumer she is NOT qualified! She donated millions to the campaign the only damn reason he nominated her!
I live in Columbia Falls, and have the same concerns. Vote no!
@SenSchumer DeVos is not being installed to FIX public education but to BREAK it. Speak plainly. This ain't about fairness.
@SenSchumer she is terrible
New post, Hurt Feeling at http://www.mended-chi.com 
@SenSchumer. Sure hope that you are concerned as well. Aren't you?
Vote no! She's dangerously unqualified!
#NoDeVos
our current education system is failing.
Them grizzlies tho.
DeVos like the rest of Trumps appointments is totally unqualified. I worked in public school for 26 years.
@SenSchumer If this  was a real job interview wouldn't the applicant have to be qualified for the position? DeVos is NOT
@ItsMeCathi Women's safety on campus is vital to women's access to education.   Vital.
@SenSchumer let me guess! Another Democrat!
she is grotesque! there is no other word to describe her! this is a relentless nightmare. #werefucked
Yeah, there are a few un-American people in Montana, but what do the pro-American people of Montana say?
20%, one in five children are not achieving growth. Both gifted and holistic learners will suffer.
I work extensively with underserved families in MT. i20% dyslexics, no teacher training in MT. We can do better. NO on DeVos.
please protect our public education. Do not divert funds to non-government institutions.
Not since Harriet Miers has so woefully unprepared a candidate for federal office appeared for confirmation.
i really don't want her confirmed.
Our liberal indoctrination system doesn't provide an education.  We are declining in all areas due to political correctness.
Ms DeVos is a serious threat to our public education system. I vehemently oppose her confirmation.
She also does not support the federal special education law.
how will you address this?
Obviously during the past 8 years nobody was familiar with how to teach the 3 R's. Basis for being educated!!
with these be Republican Montanans or democratic Montanans
just confirm her. The DOE needs to be abolished anyway. Get the fed out of our schools.
@SenSchumer please DO NOT let her be confirmed! My child with disabilities deserves better, all kids do! It's on us!
Catch phrases of Unity & Encouragement promised in Election has denigrated to strategy of Ridicule and Turmoil
These are Montana values.  So Jon, whats your take?  Will you vote to confirm her nomination or not?
@SenSchumer Seems she has the Grizzly bear attacks in the classroom covered.  #NomoreK12Griz
@SenSchumer please do confirm her. She is not qualified.
If someone moved to Big Sandy to farm w/ no experience, they'd fail. Devos is that farmer to public ed. Pls vote against her
please Senator Tester, vote no to Betsy DeVos. She's completely unqualified. We need a champion for PUBLIC schools & students
@SenSchumer USA kids are not where they need to be academic wise. She will bring that back. #forthekids
@SenSchumer I agree!  Vote NO
@SenSchumer Watched the hearing on TV. She has a lot of nasty conflicts of int - for profit schools & loan collection
please vote no on this nomination. Privatizing education with public dollars is not OK for kids or our country!
@SenSchumer mostly union teachers wanting to keep choice away from the disadvantaged. You both know this. Misleading.
@SenSchumer She gave no committment to help/address public schools concerns Nothing on Common Core Does she know what it is
@SenSchumer I'm in Louisiana and have those same concerns. Plus she seems to ignore that there ARE charter schools w/problems
@SenSchumer Michigan's feelings
@SenSchumer No degree in education should disqualify her off the bat. No everyone has  $$$ for private schooling. DAH!
@SenSchumer dump her
@SenSchumer She made millions off MI charter schools while public schools failed. Huge DJT donor. Not qualified to serve.
@SenSchumer On the plus side, she's keenly aware of the rampant grizzly bear problem in schools. #devos #grizzlies
@SenSchumer how does plan to protect poor children  in states with little money our rural areas.
Please vote NO on this nomination!
@SenSchumer pub schools, teachers & poor lose w for-profit schools (a type of segregation); vote down for this &other reasons
@SenSchumer She wants to arm the schools to shoot invading bears though so...
@SenSchumer NO to DeVoss!!
@SenSchumer she's a puppet.  No deprh
@SenSchumer She has no interest in supporting public education.
Please continue to question! Our children's education is too important to put in the hands of someone like this!

@SenSchumer why doesn't anyone else in the GOP see this????????
@SenSchumer here's my concern. SHES NOT FUCKING QUALIFIED FOR THIS POSITION!!!! I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!!!
You're a mean tweeter-
zero experience in education, has disdain for public schools. Vote NO on #BetsyDeVos
I agree with all of those comments.  Scary.  Public education should be our priority.  We need a leader with experience!
