So you want to control their minds your way.  Peachy.  More mind-numb robotic jesus people.
Bcause they have a much more important agenda n they arent sharing it with u. they will destroy u

Go for it!! Please keep her away from anything that has to do with education!

Honestly, I could live with a dog as president at this point. As long as it was a smart one.
if trumps a dog at least hes a purebred Clinton just a plain mut.
Student loan borrowers need a @usedgov secretary that is qualified to solve the student debt crisis.#1moreround, @SenAlexander
stop going to expensive private schools on a student loan for an English or Art degree #solved
Oh? What about a business or medical degree at a nonprofit?? #notsolved
if you become an MD and take out loans knowing you can't pay back...we shouldn't bail you out
Very smart, common sense thinking.....clearly too difficult for some to understand 
Not sure whom you are addressing. The only ppl who can afford a $300k med degree are the 1%
Sorry but that's not correct, many take out loans & come from modest means
then you and I are simply not understanding each other. 140 char is a bit limiting.
@SenSchumer @usedgov @SenAlexander Liz, your treatment of DeVos-shameful. She was classy,  & you behaved like a low-life leftist.
@BlueMark55 @usedgov @SenAlexander No to DeVos please!!!
HOW ABOUT... WHAT ON EARTH IS SHE THINKING, SHE HAS NO BUSINESS BEING ANYWHERE NEAR EDUCATION!?!? SHE AND HER GUNS CAN GO HUNT GRIZZLIES
I sincerely wish you had gotten those rounds of questions.
@ceanews Murphy: "I look forward to working with you". What's the point of hearings? She's already confirmed. The worst ever.
she does not even believe in punch education. Please stop her
Ask her to step aside!
you got any question that involve our children's education .Didn't think so
all of us public school teachers WITH WAY MORE EXPERIENCE THAN HER have a lot more questions too...#unfit
@usgov Consider yourself a criminal lawyer at this point, these mooks won't '$nitch' #Untouchables #Capone #usGangsters
so crazy and wrong. I was infuriated watching you all get denied a second round of questioning
@SenSchumer @usedgov @SenAlexander we need more
@SenSchumer @usedgov @SenAlexander Crazee incompentent parasites vetting our leaders? They let criminal Kenyen w/ fake ID be pres
@BlueMark55 @usedgov @SenAlexander She cannot hold office of education of any sort; imbeciles cannot run institutions of learning
Looking forward to it.  Right now, she fails every test.
Wish you would've been there for Bernie. We wouldn't be in this mess right now if you had.
@SenSchumer @usedgov @SenAlexander Can you please ask her why she even calls herself American?
the only question you need to ask is why a totally unqualified personike her should even be considered.
@SenSchumer @usedgov @SenAlexander ***The next question shud be "why am I here, I'm inconsequential and unimportant. I'm a fool".
@Fired_Up_2016 @usedgov @SenAlexander c
Warren, please go back to sleep. You are a has been corrupt political HACK.
She's disgraceful, grandstanding & petty not even shaking the nominees hand. #riseabove
Well done Sen Warren you demonstrated #BetsyDeVos incompentence! She is completely unfit for the job!!
@SenSchumer @usedgov @SenAlexander also let Trump know we want his tax returns. #showyourtaxes
VERY disappointed in lack of substantive questions. Petty behavior not even shaking the nominees hand!  
She & her family have systematically ruined schools here in MI.  All they care about is $!  #DeVosHearing
won't she just be swept through when this is completed? Yeah she is unqualified but will be voted in.
We The People Say VOTE NO on Betty DeVois! #TheResistance
@maddow @MaddowBlog @amjoyshow @MSNBC
can't even shake her hand;shows an amazing amount of pettiness, lack of class and professionalism by you
Thanks for standing strong on this issue so eloquently!!
Great job of questioning today.  Thank you.
@mtaeckens @usedgov @SenAlexander Incompetence is incredibly dangerous. Put our country & our children before party politics pls
I live in Michigan.  Out system is all messed up.
I think you've had enough time at the mic. Let others have a turn. No one is listening to you anyway.
Thank you!!
--- I guess a multimillionaire like Warren can ask lots of questions
luv you Elizabeth you rock
@heartrocksrock @usedgov @SenAlexander keep at it girlfriend
Thank you Senator Warren
please please senator Warren, do your duty and derail devos for SofE. She is a train wreck waiting to happen. ADVOCATE LOUDLY!
let @SenWarren ask her questions. I as a voter want to hear the answers. #DoYourJob
Those were excellent questions but poor answers. I'm afraid of my future years as a college student.
why are these phonies coming to Washington I thought the swamp was getting drained!? #confused #urawesome!
@BetsyDeVos Sadly, SHE doesn't have 3 more rounds of ANSWERS 4 you senator.   
#DeVosNotQualified
thank you so much senatri Warren for standing up for your people 
@BetsyDeVos  Why are Qs limited? Those who have nothing 2 hide, hide nothing. #DeVosNotQualified #shady
I'm so grateful for your thorough, thoughtful, relevant questioning. DeVor is bad for children.
more rounds are necessary! What are they afraid of?
Educators dedicate lives to serving ctry's children.This appointment slap in face.Disgraceful.
I glad he shut your pie hole your constant whining it tiresome . BTW, a person with some class would have shaken hands.
you would only have a few questions if you limited them to intelligent questions
Unusually short list for you. Most independent voter like myself have only one for you. Are you sane?
please save the future generation from this unfit nominie @BetsyDeVos and from #potentialgrizzlies
thank you for representing
.@SenWarren  give her hell @usedgov @SenAlexander
some say over the top with attitude not always a good thing
how can u grill on fraud when that's all u have done Pocahontas.ur a fraud& I think we need to impeach u
@SenSchumer  you need to investigate yourself
I am beginning to think that transparency in American democracy is a practice of the past; is American democracy far behind1
cant wait!!!! #Trump r u fucking kidding me???? She's more lost than u r!!!!
#GODHELPUS
one more ROUND! !
money is not only a qualification, it's mandatory.  Money, can in fact, buy anything.
America needs a strong public education system.  For profit schools don't always prove to be better.
the problem is that no one in the GOP cares that the nominees are corrupt or incompetent
Maybe you should have asked them instead of your long diatribe in advance.
STICK EM your 5 minutes of fame is over. BULLY
thank you for asking the tough questions
There are about 100 patriots with 3 more rounds..............................
DeVos cannot be trusted to enforce IDEA, Title IX, ADA, gun safety laws, civil rights. Not. Our. Kids!
DeVos is totally about getting money back for her donations she wants billions for her Millions
it's like I'm living in Idiocracy
mop the floor w the oligarchs hag
I'm making popcorn.
They're not interested in hearing reason. The GOP has a self-serving agenda of failure to push.
should be able to ask as many questions as possible. This is job interview of sorts
why have these hearings when it seems all will get confirmed no matter what comes out
You can spend the time shoring up your "native" creds #Fauxcahontas
Thank you.  DeVos must not be confirmed.
get we done!  #FakePresident
let the senators do their job and give them more time for questions, & she needs to finish paperwork
Again... no one cares what you think... you are a harpie an embarrassment to women!
Yawn.....Yawn.....the daily witch hunt- must be exhausting in your head
@mark_lyre @usedgov @SenAlexander and I'm waiting to see you quit your job because you simply aren't good for it
She's fighting for you right now whether you believe it or not, keeping the rich and powerful in check. Bless her.
This regular person & voting citizen would like to hear those questions & answers in a public forum.
@kmusheno @usedgov @SenAlexander thanks for pointing out the Disability issues with her appointment.
get that pale face. WOOO WOOO WOOOO!!!!!!
you Dems don't care about children, most of your questions were about her finances
Keep up the fight. Our children deserve a true advocate and leader.
please keep this woman away from children's education. Michigan schools are a mess because of her.
You are a fraud, senator! You are only out for your name in a headline. Disgusting!

Not going to happen.  You were way to long winded already.
WE are asking WHY the US is installing Putin puppet w/o investigation #StayTheInaug NOW
No paperwork, 1 rd of Qs, no prep.

It's as if GOP thought $200M in donations would green light her? 
Reasonable people could care less about your questions

Mean spirited and unproductive

@SenateDems
gonna be waiting a long time. If you were at least slightly kind, you might get more time.
@barackobama Had ZERO EXPERIENCE AND YOU LET HIM BE PRESIDENT! No basis for anything, anymore! @TheDemocrats
Ask her how2handle ppl who misrep diversity e.g. Native American statusOncollege applications @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls
Glad she will be confirmed.
Ask her how2handle ppl who misrep diversity e.g. Native American statusOncollege applications @SenWarren @SenSchumer @usedgov @SenAlexander
#DeVosHearing. Please continue grilling. She's not qualified.
de Voss will destroy public education. Fight against her.
I'm from Michigan - DeVos has wrecked large parts of Michigan Public Education system. No to DeVos
Vouchers weaken Public Education - No to DeVos
Save our Public Education system - No to DeVos
Give them hell.
.Iron lady@SenWarrendon't let the bully bully no one
We want her! American Citizens.
@SenSchumer @usedgov @SenAlexander 

5min: Ask her questions, especially of facts, and have her commit to answer them in writing.
@SenSchumer @usedgov @SenAlexander ANYONE, Rep or Dem, who cares at ALL about education, should be concerned by #DeVosHearing
keep it up!  Go get her!,
Senator Warren could be a wonderful contributor if she stopped partisan Grandstanding.
keep up the fight Elizabeth Mr Alexander get out of the way. You will pay for your partisan obstructionism. U R killing education
Thank God for you Senator Warren. #2020POTUS
do they include anything about how you supported school choice until it became a political liability to u?
the picks are a travesty!
I would really like it if you would just retire and disappear!
It's a travesty, not to be forgotten, the majority won't allow real inquiry into these nominees.
please keep them coming!!!
Thank you! Keep pushing. DeVos is NOT what is best for ALL our children!
Make sure to ask about the Grizzly Bear threat level today. Parents keeping children home because of it.
THANK GOD for Alexander
thank you for your doggedness! We need you!
Love you're work senator warren . 
Thank you. Please save us.
You go, girl!  :)
I have two kids in public school. I am proud to see you are protecting them senator.
great job. Please do not let DeVoss fleece our education system under the false guise of better education
Post your questions for us to see. Thank you for all you do.
You are not asking questions but pontificating. The bias is so thick it's suffocating.
I'm still IRKED about MI using TANF funds for exp priv col scholarships instead of for real needy families
Go get the ignoramus! With you all the way, kick her out.
And here is how Betsy's Blackwater brother helped steal the election
betsey, girl. you got an F for that. fail. you failed miserably hun. #EducationSecretary #BetsyDeVos
how about a Phd candidate with k-12 education and private/public college experience passion for community?
Sen. Warren's condescending tone makes her look petulant.
@SadSadGayle @usedgov @SenAlexander Please no confirmation of DeVos, she will privitize our public ed system. Please for the kids
@meoww1313 I think of all the candidates she is the best at ring around the posey.Go get her..
Yep 
U can bloviate & brow beat DeVos.Stomp on her integrity, until Ur moccasins wear out.Harry Reed's rule still gets her appointed!
How is it legal for politicians DeVos has backed to be on the committee? That is a major conflict correct?
Thank you Thank you!!
A replay of today's hearing:
-- @BetsyDeVos only paid him for 1 round, she demands a bang for her buck.
Thank you @SenWarren!!! This nominee is completely unqualified to serve. She gave non-answers to most questions. @usedgov @SenAlexander
Thank you for fighting for us Senator Warren! Thank you for asking the important questions!
tell us more about "free" education
@SenSchumer @usedgov @SenAlexander stick it to her!
ask her what benefit she believes public schools share with our nation's society. bad answer? she's fired!
i beleive that Russian president hacking...was in motion in 2013 when trump visited ussr. keep digging
.@SenWarren @s88d293 @usedgov @SenAlexander Time to pull the plug on Betsy DeVos - http://go.shr.lc/2gajbXA  #RepublicanParentsAgainstDevos
The only thing anyone in MI has learned from Devos is if someone is trying to reconnect w/ u, they r selling Amway
Can your first question be, "Do you understand the meaning of a yes or no question?"
(you were awesome) 
 
Must see TV: Senate hearing of #BetsyDeVille

Tough times soon: LGBT, special needs students (& puppies)
keep it up Senator!
BRILLIANT! Get her.
Thank you for doing all you do. Do you think you'll have a chance to re-interview? #NoPlutocracy
Thank you for standing up to take down this unquestionably unqualified person!!
thank you for posing the tough, but appropriate questions. #NoDeVos #publicschools #educationforall
@yodaquoter @usedgov @SenAlexander Keep up the good work Senator. 
Hasn't #BetsyDeVos adequately disqualified herself already? What more do the @GOP need to hear?
you would be assuming that @GOP listens to what we say 
what are they so scared about unless she doesn't know the answers
@NoStress2Blessd @usedgov @SenAlexander Trump needs to grow up & find actually qualified people to help run OUR country.
qualifications need to trump donations.
Go away please.
who is this sen. Alexander? this educ woman should be barred from all schools. can nominees be denied?
you're "waiting"? Hope you're comfortable going to be a long wait! #LMAO @SenAlexander #Trumpwon #PEOTUS #MAGA #DTS
great job!!! She is not qualified at all!!!
This process is a sham.  BTW: can I interest you in Amway products?
please keep asking questions! DeVos is not qualified! Does not even know what IDEA is, guns in schools-no way; please help!
@BellwetherLV @usedgov @SenAlexander 
She is so not prepared for this position.
And she has the support of millions of Americans to do so.
1 more round! Our children are too important.
