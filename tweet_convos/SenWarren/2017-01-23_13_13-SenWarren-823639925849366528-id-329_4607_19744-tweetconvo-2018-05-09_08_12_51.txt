can you introduce a bill that requires men who lose control of their sperm and impregnat a woman w/o permission go to jail?
So now you want to control the men that live in other Countries
no, this is separate from the global gag rule, not an addition to. I should have been more clear.
That your confused about issue being discussed on thread. No got it
I just think if we are making all women responsible for their choices, we should ask American men to as well
if you let a mans dick between your legs, expect it to come with sperm.. #ohgeez
I believe the whole "without permission" bit implied that you didn't let them....
you can agree to have sex and not agree to be impregnated.
How about being the first in line to stop obstructing Cabinet appointees,Oh wait that would fit YOUR Agenda!$$
does verifying qualifications count as obstructing?
So which appointees would you say have not been vetted enough for there position?
Anybody that hasn't yet passed investegations from the OGE.
Thats an easy way out. You seem to know whats going on Please tell me 1 nominee that has not?
Looks like all the nominees I care about have reports now. Thank you for making me look that up!
I'm curious to learn more about Senator Warren's obstruction -- any links to share on that?
Why are you voting, at all, let alone in favor if, any Trump noms? @SenWarren America is disappointed in you.
Ben Carson? Really? Do you think our fearless leader will stop referring to you as Pocahontas?
Thank you for standing up against this. Please help with the EPA info gag rule, too. #TinyHands #Truthosity
thanks for your hard work
Thank you for standing up.
Yes please do!!!!!!!
Thank you!
@WomenNMedia @SenatorShaheen Quit voting to confirm stupid people.
Plz @SenWarren put forward a Bill to protect SCIENCE & Federal employees as #Trump @POTUS is putting GAG RULES on Gov as he did B4 w/#NDAs
Please protect us from these men trying to legislate our bodies
why are you supporting Carson?
@jboogie_pdx @SenatorShaheen Block all of his ppl
I guess you weren't listening to Pres Trump's inaugural speech.. time Americans come FIRST!!
Yes, but Trump's "Americans" MUST include ALL Americans. Sick ones with cancer and LGBT's & minorties
Of course!  He mentioned all Americans in speech, he is not excluding anyone
He may say "all Americans" but look at his Executive Orders. Actions say more than words.
Plz @SenWarren go on T.V. & challenge Trump on Gag Rule for Federal employees, No GAG Rule for Fed EMPLOYEES, as #Trump employees w/#NDAs!
trouble
Thank you! And remember, we've got your back. #WomenUnitedAgainstTrump
nope, providing funds for family planning and contraception will decrease the need for them
Thank you both!
yet u are voting for #BenCarson who thinks abortions should be illegal instead of #resisting you caved no wonder demos lost #DSA
why vote for BenCarson? Disappointed
Why did you vote yes 4 Carson 4 HUD?
You are also cosponsoring Ben Carsons confirmation. Can't take you seriously anymore.
 to you, my Senator!
glad to hear. Women around the world need clear information not ideology.
thank you. Millions of women around the world depend on this executive order being overturned.
why not do it on your own
keep fighting for us.
ok but BEN CARSON? REALLY?
The only reason it was reactivated was as revenge for the march last wknd. It needs to be abolished. PERIOD!
Thank you.
@LoriSums @SenatorShaheen
What about the Dakota pipeline? ??
Is Trump going to authorize killing the Sioux?
Democrats have no power. They abandoned us to underemployment & abused anyone that spoke up. To hell with you.

please continue to fight for us. <3
So, why did @SenatorShaheen vote to confirm a torture fan to be CIA chief???
Great Job Senator Warren! Keep fighting for us!!!

The global gag rule kills women. It is dangerous. I'm with you!
.@SenWarren @SenatorShaheen Will you also be acting to obstruct his unqualified cabinet appointees or are you going to keep voting yes?
Thank you for your continued #LEADERSHIP! Something other Senators (esp @GOP) can learn from your example!
You won't be elected again. Pl know it was a mistake. You're looney tunes.
