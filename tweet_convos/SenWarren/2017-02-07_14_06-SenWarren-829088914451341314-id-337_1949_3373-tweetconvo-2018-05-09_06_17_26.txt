let's talk about how you teachers are more worried about your bloated pensions than children's best interest
Not sure what country u are talking about, my teacher friends in The Nederland's have amazing pensions, my American ones do not.
Teachers here pay for a large budget of their teaching supplies out-of-pocket! Even in private schools(my son; k-8)
I know, i have seen it, incredible how little they are paid for the hard work. I have many teacher friends,sad!
Teachers Union is very powerful in America while letting the teachers go by the wayside
teachers union are the biggest lobbyists in Washington!
what r u talking about?! My state doesn't even have teachers union
It was obvious in my tweet that I wasn't referring to any/all particular teachers
Boycott his restaurants: I am:
Which chain is his? I'll boycott ANYTHING ANY trump NOMINEE OWNS!
he's CEO of CKE Restaurants Holdings, parent company of Carl's Jr., Hardee's, & Green Burrito chains.
there's also Red Burrito, which is Green Burrito for states that have Hardee's instead of Carl's Jr.
the Hardee's / Carl's Jr. split is a bit like Best Foods / Hellmann's mayo: owned by the same company.
as with the mayonnaise, they started as two separate companies that merged. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CKE_Restaurants …
Thank you! Let's get the message out!

Meanwhile, You and Obama drained the middle class, crushed business and destroyed our healthcare. Fools!
This Nut job got $400K to teach 1 class, yet screams about College costs? The 1/100000000th Indian is Nuts
@Tatterhood54 @USDOL @washingtonpost He was hand picked to dismantle DOL.

GO AWAY!!! America doesn't want you in government any more!
you don't think they all squeeze the illegal immigrants? Not to mention avoid labor laws. You're sad
you realize that your side lost, right?
how long have the dems squeezed the American worker OUT of the workforce &forced onto perpetual welfare? 
#resistDemocrats
as former @CKE mgr: w/out doubt #Pudzer as #LaborSec will be step backward for our workforce, including #PWD. #CripTheVote
How?
can we read all of the employees' stories instead? That'd be way more accurate.
No? Then don't post.
How are your book sales going, #Fauxcahontas?
How's that book deal coming? Fraud

#politicalwhore #fulltimehypocrite


Is that anything like being a slum tenant? #politicalwhore
hey grannie elections have consequences if you wanted to make your mark you should run against the old witch
Hey, He is PERFECT for this POTUS's Cabinet. The POTUS spent a career squeezing pussy.
The Obama admin squeezed the middle class and minority communities dry.
is #fakenews. Nothing but democrat party BS and propaganda. Only dumb people (democrats) believe them.
- The only disaster is Fauxcahontis there..
At least he employs people. All you do is try to hand out money to get votes and keep people down.
One employee??
And you have made a career out of lying!
You're STILL whining +#agitating?
WHY haven't you #DNC+#GOP #Criminals+#FakeNewsaccomplices been arrested yet?@SenWarren@USDOL #Puzder

#persist,Lady Warren,u r not Alone
@SenSchumer @USDOL @washingtonpost  Can you vote him out?
ONE Employee, that's all you have? One employee don't make it the truth! How about sold FACTS.
@SenSchumer @USDOL @washingtonpost  and what has Sen Warren and Sen Schumer done about it nothing its 2017 and they done nothing
@girlsreallyrule @USDOL @washingtonpost sewage continues to flow,and the Trump youth continue to salute the Tanning Booth Zero.
@SenSchumer @USDOL @washingtonpost this don't seem to make a difference in Trump's America. They are all getting confirmed.
@SenSchumer @USDOL @washingtonpost Really? Aren't you tired of LOSING? Unless T removes his nomination you will lose again
@SenSchumer I must have missed the part of the story where it said he forced her to work there for 21 years.
And don't forget that he employs undocumented immigrants in his house to save money. #ShePersisted
Is he also a racist, misogynist, bigot, woman hating Nazi facist like all the other Cabinet picks?
Silence!

Scenes from the battlefield: #Truth at war with #AlternativeFacts -
#Trump's mouthpiece of the incredible sniffs his finger for inspiration. 
@SenSchumer @SenateGOP Going to have to convince some GOP  Senators. Good luck with that! 
@SenSchumer @USDOL @washingtonpost
@SenSchumer @USDOL @washingtonpost u are the worst. Confirm the cabinet already y'all can actually work.
@SenSchumer lol keep wasting your time and our money.  He'll be confirmed and there's nothing you can do about it! Bwahahahaha
Maybe your friend Bill Clinton had been hanging around the restaurants
@SenSchumer @USDOL @washingtonpost Vote No on this ridiculous nomination. He is wrong for American workers and LIES!
I won't stand too close to Elizabeth Warren for fear her craziness is contagious
Watch out POCAHONTAS, THEY'LL BRING OUT YOUR DIRTY DEALS U LIAR!!!
@SenSchumer @USDOL @washingtonpost all it will take is a nice donation to a few Republicans and he's in. Swamp is greedy
@SenSchumer @USDOL @washingtonpost Senator Hypocrite Warren forgot to mention 1.5 million extra income? Who is calling who bad ?
Warren real PHONY FRAUD
@SenSchumer @USDOL @washingtonpost Liz I think you need to be better informed! Have you had a stroke ? Retire & be senile at home
@SenSchumer @USDOL @washingtonpost it's got to suck to wake up for nothing!! You built your house on sand.
@SenSchumer @USDOL @washingtonpost you lied about your heritage you try to use race to achieve your agenda.#grow up
@SenSchumer @USDOL @washingtonpost don't blame hardees for someone that did just enough to keep his job.
@SenSchumer @USDOL @washingtonpost 4 everyone of ur stories there is 1 that counters it. All companies incl gov Squeeze employees
so far batting average  zero.going forward looks even worse. dems the party of slavery is never for the people
Trump and his Cabinet of Deplorables!
Start with "right to work" laws and proceed to lower min wage, no protections eventually no jobs.
so true.  1 out of 4 fast food workers are immigrants.
James 4:8-10
Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify [1/3]
your hearts, you double-minded. Be wretched and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning [2/3]
shame  we cant find good americans to hold these positions I believe the crazy train will crash soon!
We know your prejudicial  back ground. Is this the way you will continue to raise $s for your future presidential run?
@JohnEKutinac @USDOL @washingtonpost The guy in the WH is upset fewer people are buying sweatshop shoes
Pokey. R U ever a positive person?
Always hate, anger and negativity.
Glad U were told 2 sit and shut up.
this man is the devil!
and the clintons made 100 million dollars in ten years money from foreign donors paid for chelsea wedding
I went to a Hardee's recently & workers seemed unhappy & harried.
No one told her not to set up a Roth. That was an unfortunate choice. You made sure you have a retirement, mee too.
Anyone who is making $8n per hour after 21 years needs to make themselves more valuable to earn more. You did, I did
No one is supposed to work at Hardees for 21 years. maybe 2 or 3 until you graduate, unless you move into management.
Yes, you did work 4 the biggest CROOK #CorruptHillary KNOWING she was crooked! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOHqLScuz-4 …
Hardees is supposed to be part time; try concentrating on building the real economy; see Trump for help.
U rock # vet this people
What's with these appointees? These Billionaires all hate the little guy! He's all about the buck$$$$$.
husband has a PhD, it took 43 years to salary  $100, 000 . daughter is M.D.  5years she makes 500,000.
- the economy in late 80s & 90s was good- could this person really not find better paying job?
Trump has the innate ability of picking the very worse people for the job! It is down right scary!
Liz do you really want to go down that road.... We won't talk about the money you have....
Puzder hates employees. He's a terrible employer.
He and Sessions together protects NOONE, DISCRIMINATION IS MORE AT RISK AND NOW ACCEPTABLE? #TRUTHTOPOWER
cheap employers such as cracker barrel will not open in higher wage states. They know where criminal wages are allowed
@therealzanetta @USDOL @washingtonpost he should not be confirmed, but where is her state for allowing this to happen?
boycott Carl's Jr. and Hardee's
Listen up America
Greed is vanity and immensely irritating to those who witness it.
Because after 21 years as a fast food cashier he ought to be rich as a multi-millionaire Senator like you?
and the thousands of people who owe him and his company their livelihoods are of course ignored. LET THE ADULTS GET TO WRK
. Someone needs to tell the American people how to start impeachment on this president
Vote No! He is not for the working man and will only work to increase his own wealth
Is the President a Communist? Is the Repub Congress communist? Have we been sold to Russia? Who will protect us?
@CChristineFair the working class that got suckered into this will realize too late that they got skewered raw by this all
@MAHAMOSA @USDOL @washingtonpost #WorstCabinetEver What example are we setting for our children? Will any @GOP fight for ethics?
No. GOP is not going to change. Remember and vote them out.
FIGHT TILL YOUR LIL WRINKLY FACE CANT FIGHT NO MORE. GOD HAS HIS MAN IN THE LEADERS SEAT. YOU WONT WIN
@gklaurent @USDOL @washingtonpost @marcorubio Can anyone speel #BRIBE? 100,000$ That's sounds like way bigger than a misdemeaner!
Words can't even begin...This is awful for workers. What will be the final straw for trump supporters?
I don't know.
how much did Harvard pay you for one class???  Check out her net worth folks
Such a shame, the employees of America will be treated very poorly by TRUMP's nominee for Labor. Such a poor choice.
plus mob lawyer, "borrowed" from workers pensions. Nothing in this guys life was EVER best 4 the workers
Thank you for fighting for our Country! You must be exhausted? Please keep up the great work. We've got your back #TheResistance
realistically the only possible candidate LESS qualified would be the head of the Walton empire.
that story confirms one must be responsible for oneself.  A victim of one's bad decisions.
don't need to. If trump wants he must be good. And he will have them.
There's a pattern here: many Trump picks are enemies of agencies they'll lead and want to tear them down. No coincidence!
So Puzder,did you have your employees clean the walls off after you squeezed that employee to hard?
terribly troubling
represent your constituents stop this crusade
sweet Jebus stop this disaster
I would but it will make me cry  Seeing how cold this winter is. Puts me in bed for days. God is trying to hurt us tree huggers
.@SenWarren @USDOL @washingtonpost thank you for that but of misinformation Tonto
we can BOYCOTT all his business State wide; hit these people where it HURTS in their wallets he's INSANE
SOOOOO SAD.....legislators please, listen !
And didn't he accidentally have an "illegal" working in his home?

Really? You could only find one out of thousands? Take a week off & rethink the situation. 
you all know that is not the real Donald trump right. Yup, fake account!
Refusing living wage because they he knows the taxpayers will subsidize employees.
work is a funny thing. Not all jobs are equal.
Friends, who were teachers, had to give up the profession they loved because they couldn't make a living.
all I see you do is attack people do you ever do any legislating we need term limits waste of money
Democrats can't do anything?
Success Sucks!
Well there you have it. If you use one person's story to vote "NO", you wouldn't have a career either.
One more unacceptable nominee. Can this one be stopped?
trump supporters will say, "Never intended to be a career at Hardees." Or "Shouldn't have had kids."
Quote a #45 supporter: "Nobody forced u to stay 20 years at a dead end entry level job."
we are in a hopeless situation. There is no opposing The Orangemen.  They have the power.
#PuzderisaPutz
DeVos was a fail so on to Andy Puzder. Right, #lyingliz? #givingdopesavoice #crazyladyprobs #politicalhack
it would have helped if this person acted like a grown up
Seems like he appoints worst person possible and Dems confirm. SAY NO TO ALL OF THEM.
Dems too busy Supporting Convicted Domestic Terrorist's See Obama clemency 1/17/17
please and thank you
I need a favor  for the people of New Orleans
