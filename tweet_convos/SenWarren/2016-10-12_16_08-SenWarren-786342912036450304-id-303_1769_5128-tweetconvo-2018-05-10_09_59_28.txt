DOJ? thats a laugh.
SHOULD @HillaryClinton DO THE SAME
Everyone agrees. Everyone also realizes we should  all listen to @SenWarren about everything. —@elizabethforma, too 
Sorry, your tweet sounds sarcastic, I will erase
that investigation can get in line beyond the clinton foundation scandal!
Now I here California is investigating low level employees. Why do the grunts always take the the hit?
you supported @HillaryClinton go home warren your drunk!
Lucky he isn't in prison.
It's disgraceful.
you should look into smaller scams like $EEGI. Lead on shareholders then tried to say we knew what we were invested in
hw about all the bankers obama bailed out and they with their millions
Stay out of private business
and shame on you for stumping for HC a women that is involved with many criminal acts and had sold out many women
Why aren't you demanding the same from #Hillary,Bill,Chelsea,Foundation?C'mon Warren,stop being fakey!
@KellyannePolls if he is 1 for 3 - you're 0 for 5! HYPOCRITE WARREN AND SANDERS! NO SHAME!! Both Liars and cheats
His resignation is 1/3 of the resolution. He still walks away with millions he swindled from customers and employees
he did nothing to swindle anyone! Get the story straight or close pie hole!
Who gets prosecuted, only bad check writters? Owners should pay for this.
Prosecute WellsFargo. How can they get away with this crime? No trust in Justice Department now.
Did DOJ/SEC Prosecute, it was fraud? He retired made $120 million Is the #Dem paid for, it's 2017 but Old West villain makes law.
I wish I understood why he and his cohort were not fired. Instead Wells Fargo paid them huge amt for bad behavior.
he needs to face a Federal Prison Charge
you should resign and I hope Trump kicks you to the curb!
DOJ is a corrupted puppet of the Democrats. No Justice in this country.The crooks are running the gov & stuffing their pockets
Face DOJ investigation? Kinda like Hillary? LOL You are such a joke and hypocrite.
how'd that work out architech of scam resigned with $125M & Stumpf $137M
#hillary should return every dime she received from dictator countries that demonize women.
well atleast he never pretended to be an indian for his own personal benefit
So should Hillary Clinton. You're a massive hypocrite
and your buddy @HillaryClinton should return the donations from Wells Fargo. Right Liz?
boycott Trump Whine
@KellyannePolls YOU SHOULD RESIGN!! REASON: YOUR CRAVEN SELFISH NEED 4 POWER HAS U WORKING FOR HRC U HYPOCRITE!!!
send them 2 jail if #Iceland can do it any other job they'd B fired & jailed #shutthemdown http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/10/24/if-iceland-can-jail-bankers-for-the-crash-then-why-cant-america/&refURL=https://www.google.com/&referrer=https://www.google.com/ …
it's sad. You try to be Carville but you just don't have the cells for it.
so should some other high profile people. We need the same rules for everyone
;  1 for 3 is .333 and in MLB that's a $20mm a year payout! Stumph should pay it all back!!
A complete failure of #leadership in a bank too big to fail https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/too-little-late-barry-conchie …
All talk no action!! If you & @SenSanders feel so strongly about it where is the prosecution?? #AllTalkNoAction
he retired, does that mean he keeps the money?
good idea, Elizabeth, u should return every nickel that you received through your fraud Native American scholarship
@GeneMcVay @WellsFargo if @HillaryClinton wasn't indicted by @TheJusticeDept @FBI , WF won't be.
#FBImWithHer #HillarysEmails
all the more reason NOT to do business with Wells Fargo since they are basically rewarding bad and illegal behavior.
@GeneMcVay @WellsFargo Why should they do that?  If their friend and yours HRC gets elected, they'll just get a pat on the back.
maybe investigate, Senator, before rendering judgment.
He shd go 2 prison 4 his efforts. Wht hppns 2ppl w damaged credit? R they on their own?
Just like HRC should return every nickel that ended up in the Clinton Fund while she was SOS..
Not business since. He had to pay the employees more in bonus they didn't earn than money gain for the accounts.
Veterans has to wait over a year for healthcare. Congress get healthcare quick. Why not wait a year.
Go get Trump next for all of his fraudulent business dealings
so should you
lol elizabeth warren should be in jail...he upset her? good, hope she has a stroke
Why is he going home like nothing happened, he has my money . Stop right there, you need to pay by going 2 jail
He has our money, wait a minute he needs to go to jail.
Thank you for grilling Mr. Stumpf,however, the problem of unrealistic sales goals is not limited to Wells Fargo. 
so should Hillary
Great JOB!!!
Pocohontas should scalp pale face.
And make him spend his retirement attending #trump rallies.
I sent your office a message, they are still doing it, I have proof!
speaking of resigning, tell Hlary to resign!
; @WellsFargo CEO would make a perfect Democrat @POTUS nominee. @seanhannity @luvGodncountry @KevinJacksonTBS @nypost @Forbes @WSJ
yes indeed, who's next on the 'bankster kill list'?
Seriously, you're a Hillary shill, you have no credibility when it comes to ethics. Pot meet kettle.
You should do the same along with @HillaryClinton & @billclinton You are all perpetrating ur own scam!! #TRUMP2016
so you're obviously one of the ones who are NOT profiting from this scam. I wonder which politicians are. for shame..
Don't worry Warren. You are still richer than him even though you did manage to cut his net-worth by half.
.@SenWarren @WellsFargo It's your job to do the other 2!  Go get him!  #lockhimup
Elizabeth, isn't your job to make sure these things do not happen in the first place?
is refusing to clear the accounts and balances of phony accounts. Is there an number to call?
Rep.Kline is trying to rob Multiemployer retirees pensions,He's for Big Bus.over the little guy.Composite Legacy bill
Hillary should resign, return every nickel she's made while bilking America, and face prosecution for her crimes. 0 for 3
At least this is a good start.
Weird how quickly EW jumps on bad actors in banking industry but ignores Hillary's indiscretions.
#shill
Good luck with that when Hillary is president.  How many bankster CEO's did Obama send to jail again?  Oh wait...
The irony is he probably would be if you had supported @BernieSanders instead of selling out to $Hillary.
-- why do i sense the other two will follow shortly? amen.
ok let's not overdo it
#obama has power thru executive order to end CEOs criminal activity & golden parachutes but he doesn't do anything??!
/ So glad you showed his true colors, most CEO's are rich cowards that hide behind innocent people, great Job
@ranman09 @WellsFargo 
Is he related to Donald Drumpf, or do they just share the same scam gene?
there's a first for everything, I agree with senator Warren.
dismantle good ole boy's clubs that tout 'boys will be boys' so that those BOYS can become MEN! #ethical #leadership
I agree and the same for HRC. Executives and politicians will keep frauding when both are not held accountable
His groomed successor taking the helm??? As the old Southern saying goes, "That dog don't hunt."
Contact Attorney Gary Dubin in Honolulu, HI on 808-537-2300 for all the details.  He is an expert on how the big banks operate.
I would also settle for him being forced to live in a basement Chicago apt living only on his wages from the corner pizza joint.
The Quants worked under the leadership and direction of @WellsFargo CEO Stumpf-get real where the problems are modeled
the last thing you would do if you were about to lose your job is give money back to the people firing you. #fact
How is it that you don't know this isn't within the purview of the SEC?
was it the high cheekbone giveaway that tipped u off??!!
Go stumpf.   Go figure
He should be prosecuted. Go after these criminals. Do your job.
need more details regarding the 'return' and the precedent it sets for banks and other businesses...
warren go back to the reservation.
"FOLLOW THE MONEY"!..you call back all the execs. who left over a year and you will have at least 2, who will tell everything.
maybe you should get off ur bully pulpit, and charge him and stop hiding behind ur title and flapping ur gums
SO ARE YOU POW WOW POW WOW DOJ NEEDS TO CHECK YOU OUT.OR DEPT. OF I.N.T. SOMEONE. YOU MADE IT. SCAM.TO INDIANS.
I'm not optimistic about the other two. Where's @POTUS?
Amounts like 173 mln dollar for a CEO are an insult to normal workers, USA is f**ked up when it comes to this.
you're a hater fr
Why after all these years of bank irregularities and fraud nobody is in jail.
POW WOW POW WOW AND DID NOT START MY COMPANY YOU DID.BUT DID NOT SE YOU BUSTING YOUR ASS.
Election year BS...how come this didn't happen following Global Financial Crisis and Obama's election... already in office is why
#AMEN https://youtu.be/AyeTqyOe3lE  @SenWarren @perrro2 @WellsFargo

@Ask_WellsFargo I'm ready for some Grace. Please forgive the balance of my mortgage. You could save my marriage and my life.
As soon as @HillaryClinton returns the millions she was paid  for private speeches to the same Wall St banks! @billclinton too.
At least he has the humility to step down. You still don't have the guts to admit your lie of being Indian!
YOU ARE SO ME POW WOW POW WOW. BUT IF I WAS SO RICH I WOULD GET THE HELL OUT OF DODGE TOO F HUMILITY. LET OTHERS!!
now the scam is already extended to 2005, this way Stumf will have to pay back every nickel he ever made! #WellsFargo
get out of office please
Stumf riding into the sunset like MacKenna'sGold, gold made of sweat & tears of millions of nameless hourly workers #WellsFargo
Nothing will change until these criminals start going to jail.
Why did you wait 7+ years? What about the massive control fraud the FBI warned about at the root of the Financial Crisis? LATE!
Senator you are supported to do what is right and just to hold financial executives accountable.
@ajthompson13 @WellsFargo DOJ lost credibility with Clinton investigation fiasco. US has become a corrupt corporate oligarchy.
You are about to be blocked. This is disgusting.
it feels like this retirement was planned
Keep going Senator! Thank you for your diligence thus far!!!! #1for3notenoughforme #accountability
, I am totally fed up with their B S.  Go after them!
He's going to spend the rest of his days handing out multiple piggy banks to his grandchildren.
are you and the rest of the democrats going to do the same with all of your ILL gotten gains???HELL NO!!! So shove it
Another Q: While you're on your Senate perch awaiting low-hanging fruit like Stumpf, we've awaited more from you.
Upon conviction be sent to Guantanamo and force feed his stock certificates!
FINE .KILLERS LETS WATER B.O.R.D. I DO NOT LIKE WELLS FARGO YOU WANT KILL THEM?BUT NOT KILLERS?FUNNY DUD.
Agree. This is a felony. Please bring this issue to justice. We can't let this Thief get away from this.
he'll get off easy. Shareholders (Pensions) will take the pain like always.
@WarrenBuffet After you get the $219 million back & that's just from Stumpf's pocket he goes to jail Right!?
@SenatorEWarren DOn't Mess with Senator Elizabeth Warren SHe' wonder woman! Get that money back from him!
not the only one
NO SHIT. HILLARY GET HER MONEY FROM.DA.
We should hold politicians like Warren to this standard as well
You're our champ, the voice of voiceless. We love you.
can we also then investigate your pal @HillaryClinton and Eric holder? You claim to be about justice.Please & thanks.
Very misguided and myopic. How about putting the same screws to the cable companies for "negative option billing".
Good startNOT ENOUGH. Send him to prison w/o a golden parachute #JailTheBankers to demand #Consequences4Corruption
First, why don't you get your colleague @GregoryMeeks to repay this taxpayer money? http://gothamist.com/2009/03/31/taxpayers_still_paying_for_fancy_co.php …
@InformedFed @WellsFargo You're going to return the salary you made faking being an Indian right?
why just give him immunity, he supports Hillary, you support hillary
notice that by "retiring" he took the option that lets him keep his money. Won't hold my breath on the other two.
I thought you hated lawless dictatorship Pocahontas!
F you Warren, gutless Senator. If he could have actually responded to you, you would still be in tears.
i don't think we should hold our breath on the whole return the money thing. Guys like him don't do that!
@realDonaldTrump shouldn't Hillary also face her day in court
like to see more on this on your facebook page
he dominated you fauxcahontas
, so I assume in return you will give back all money made off your abuse of FALSELY claiming "minority" status? #politicaldblstnd
It will be another shameful mark in history if these criminals  CEOs dont do jail time for fraud&theft!!!Time4justice
He didn't do it alone. Stormtroopers Carrie Tolstedt, Pete Jones, Lucia Gibbons, Mike Wilkerson, Bob Marshall, the list goes on.
Once again, it should b a business course cause they are leaving with cushy rewards. I can hear it, so long suckers!
Ahaha Gutless leadershi^p
very disingenuous... where was your ire for @HillaryClinton @ClintonFdn #WallStreet and all the bullshit?
Hillary should have resigned many times.
You should demand the same of Hillary!!!
keep fighting senator. Maybe someday some of your colleagues will join you
Again, you failed completely. Wells Fargo CEO Stumpf retires with $134M
This thief doesn't get to go live happily ever after does he? It's stolen money!
sure and also believe HRC should be elected president #Hypocrite
guess what'll happen, Elizabeth, with you and your lousy unaccountable DOJ? Nothing.
damn I would really hate to be heads of  @WellsFargo because your guilty and you know it.
Should he be held to a higher standard than Hillary?
LOW LOW LOW BAR.
as well as all those employees involved the training program!
let's see!
Congratulations! Better than nothing.
I luv ya but you really can't be serious. This didn't start with him and is not his fault. You've made him your #scapegoat
Done. Pls look into the multistate industry behind the redlight cameras? I got 2 tickets in NY, call ctr  in CO, mail goes to MA.
So should Hillary Senator Warren. @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton The DOJ is crooked
if this man walk away free it truly shows to the American people justice is not for all but for some.
remember when you scammed a university ?
Oh it would do no good if our DOJ investigates that would not be a crime if Hillary hasn't committed a crime.
Or just donate heavily to the DNC and all is forgiven.  #crookedhillary
Cheers, Elizabeth - keep fighting the good fight!
what a vengeful inhuman heartless monster
yes it's #Shameful
warren should resign too for supporting a corrupt Clinton
Can't we just print more money ? #endthefed @SenWarren @WellsFargo
