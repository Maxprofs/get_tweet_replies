good my wife got her masters from @devryuniv and is still struggling to find work and can't dent her loan hope they're next.
next step is to maintain a list of these “bad actors” that prospective students can find online.
College debt is the bane of my existance. Denver Tech took me for a ride.
dishonest Trump.
put @UOPX on the block next! Even worse, preying on our service members!
My daughter may be one. How can I find more information?
But what about private university's that are not for profit but do the same things as for profit schools?
, #DeVry University should be next.
.@SenWarren #ITTTech should also be investigated for staff low pay and long hours.
@realDonaldTrump Here's hoping phony-ass Trump University (the name alone is idiotic) gets the proper treatment too!
Tonto!
heap big private college only hire Indians!
$300,000 wampum to teach 1 course

@SenWarren @ITTTech
Loser Troll
Bill Clinton is the spokesman for the largest company in privatized education.
Go get 'em Elizabeth!
is that the one the Cilintons are in bed with?
Everybody knows that ITT Tech is a huge scam.
Shocker
We had a guy with "30 years experience" and a "degree" from ITT. He was incompetent & had no clue what he was doing.
He got ripped off in the 80s. Clearly never learned a thing.   Sad, really.  ITT needs to be shut down. #TrumpUniversity
Yeah, they probably had teachers who were paid $360,000 to teach one class. Imagine that! Go gettum' grannie!
I hate the slippery media;  noone's done a thing about it;  what do you care about consequences worse? than torture.
Is just a large version of Trump University!
if only you were this angry about Benghazi.
Why do you think Ann Koulter and others insist upon illegal aliens being deported ?  THEY ARE FUTURE VOTERS FOR DEMOCRATS
WHY is college in the USA the most expensive on the planet? We need to follow the western Europe model for our citizens.
@JoaniSparkles @ITTTech Comments?
is it Laureate?   The one bill clinton was the head of?
thank you for paying attention to the hidden corruption - you are a champion Ms. warren
Oooh Oooh, put @ClintonFdn on the block next..oh, #YOU are part of #ThatScam..you #WontAttack your #FRIEND's #RICOFraudCharity?
love to see these scams shut down & perps jailed #TrumpUniversity
that school has been around for 20 years, why is if only getting scrutiny now???
deflecting from @ClintonFdn #ClintonFraud
Jerry Airola & Silver State Helicopters did it to me and nothing happened to them. These schools need to be held accountable.
thank you!!!
Seems like a lot of non-profit should be held to same standard. Overpriced products that oversell return. Thanks to Dems
.@SenWarren @ITTTech like any school, you get out what you put in.  My ITT degree has kept me employed for last 20 yrs. Reason y I was hired
Why r all your attacks focused on free market? Free enterprise built this country. Not Collectivist policies
While U R @ it, Plz find out which country pays Z fee 4 Rudy demagogue Guiliani's talks @ IranianTerrorist organization

#You are a hack for not #BackingBernie #ShameOnYouHillary #ShameOnYouSenWarren!! #NoMoreWars!!
So are you non profit?
government doesn't like competition when it comes to screwing & cheating people
what is been done about  air tickets and check  bags
@SenWarren @ITTTech
.@SenWarren @ITTTech the real travesty is that it took this long for an investigation to occur. They've been doing this for years.
You mean Lauriat  17 million dollar employer of Bill Clinton?
Any possibility associated with Trump?
Is that one that Bill Clinton took millions from and left students deep in debt?
Why can't organizations that have billions in endowment and serve the rich pay taxes like us little people do?
Why don't you investigate if Ivy League schools should really be "not for profit" and pay no taxes?
what about the Salter school?
Key words: for profit.
Sent my dog to an Edu for Profit; got a massive student loan and an A - in English. Had an A+ but drooled on his paper.
How do you feel about former Senator Robert Byrd senator?
Okay. Should a non-profit have an almost $40 billion endowment fund ?
Better still, they should have their 501c3 status revoked and pay taxes.  The rich finishing schools should pay
Why are US tax payers paying for Free College in Afghanistan while our kids go without?
Go back to sleep Goofy!
Too bad no one investigated Western State University School of Law back in the 90's. For profit law school.
Wow! ITT tech has been around for a long time, u know when u stop seeing their commercials on TV, u know something is up
oh right for profit is a dirty word for Dems - unless they donate to Dems
the federal government needs to be under investigation for allowing incompetent senators like you to steal
They should investigate Keiser career college too.
We need you in this fight. Please continue to be vocal in opposition to Donnie the Taxman. People listen to and respect you.
And I bet the students learned their lesson... @SenWarren @ITTTech
The @HillaryClinton Foundation’s Global Bribery and Crony Access Scam. #Massachusetts
@observer this is what you use as your proof! Laughable.
I am so glad I never went there.
