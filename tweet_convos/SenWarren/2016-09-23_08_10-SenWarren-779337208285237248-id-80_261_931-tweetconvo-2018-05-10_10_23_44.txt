Its time to investigate Lizzy.  Hormones are on the rise.
this story has been around since 2013. Where the heck have you been Senator?
so it's okay for people to defraud others as long as they are lower level employees? Check

I'd like to hear from some of the former employees they claimed were responsible.

Will you personally pay that expense if no significant findings are found?
yup
Law's 4 rich!
RT @SenWarren: Yesterday I led a letter to @USDOL to investigate if @WellsFargo misclassified workers & failed to pay overtime
Thats a good thing
Imagine if everyone could charge a fee for creating something out of nothing. We'd all be gods, or bankers.
Hey @SenWarren maybe you should look at your presidential nominee before calling for the prosecution of others
should we all take our ACCT & leave this "BANK" ?
@NPR @PBS
...said the next Secretary of Labor. ♡
Corporate investigations need to cover every possible loophole because that's exactly what corps will try to manipulate.
Yes, they had a history of doing that from 2000 - 2008.  Which they had to payback after a lawsuit back then.
Oh you are soooo righteous. Please tell us more who you are using this for your own political gain.
What exactly is keeping this from criminal prosecution??
You forgot to mention that Sen Warren was a lot smarter than you & I wish she was in for POTUS
Mark I am glad that you have excepted being DEPLORABLE & you added it to your name
