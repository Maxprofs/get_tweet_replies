.@SenWarren @SenateGOP What R either of U doing 2 help 9M working US families abroad? Fix amoral citizen tax'n ASAP
#donothingGOP must go!!
Meanwhile #Flint still ignored how long now
A national disgrace!
no fresh drinking water in Michigan surrounded by Great Lakes yet we fly to help others like Haiti 
and we know Haitians aren't human and dirt poor.
and we know kids in #Flint are suffering from Lead poisoning in our own country #Priorities
Thanks guys, sure makes us want to reelect you in November so you can take more tax money from us to NOT #DoYourJob
@marcorubio Please explain Marco. I'm a constituent & I ALWAYS vote. #DoYourJob
And the Media still doesn't care Elizabeth @CNN they want Nazi loving trump to win. What can we do
who cares?she isnt flipping burgers. The seeds she has planted over her carrer dont stop growing whilst on vaca. silly
the Senate hasn't  done anything in 8 years. To help the American people. Quit whining and enter some legislation!
since you didn't want to run with Bernie, #Ash4President
Ash already picked his running mate, but would still grab a beer w/ Liz.
Considering the GOP lack of principles, perhaps it is best they remain on break.
I need yer jerb
Funny that @SenateGOP gets at least 7 weeks paid leave while denying the same to the rest of the country!
i agree do your job
I'm fed up with most of these career politicians.
Says Indian Princess Speaking Bull.
; we need legislation to drastically curtail vacation time for congress, and to start with term limits! #DoYourJob
@jimcombs @SenateGOP FOR CHRISTS SAKE GET RID OF THIS CONGRESS
well what did you propose ? Name some things you did ? On the fence with who to Support ?
@flwrpwr1969 Repubs haven't done an honest day's work since W became Pres, Boener & McConnell made it official
Haven't done much when they were there except for being obstructionist.
Time for American people to bring in strikebreakers to get work done?
@SenWarren @SenateGOP
How do we stop this? Add Campaign Finance reform, as much of the time is spent raising funds for next run
don't the senators take off when they are not in session? I'd love to have a month + off.
@m_millsey @SenateGOP You all need to do your jobs. #YouWorkForUs #NotOtherWayAround
@m_millsey @SenateGOP From YOUR web site   It's YOUR schedule.
Who gets a vacation like that, with that kind of salary (plus benefits)??
The only reason I am familiar with at least one of my state's senators is because of the election.
Good god! I want my taxes back! Or at least that portion that pays their salaries!
, can we stopping paying @SenateGOP salaries?
Makes me sick.
, funny to imagine that the average American equates welfare to those that inhabit the inner city, not Nations Capital
so you stayed and worked during the summer break? I didn't think so Pocahontas.
.@SenWarren @SenateGOP Liz-summer break part of Congresses yearly gift no matter who's in power-Congress has quit working for Americans 1st
but you were hard at work trying to create compromise with Senate Republicans, right?
how can we (common people) help? should be a simple way to hold legislators accountable in this age of tech.
this is my 80hr paycheck this is happening in America's backyard, @GovHerbert Tim Dahle shame
As usual, nothing productive from the "party of 'No.'"
yes there are no democrats in Washington. The president is not democrat. Must be he GOP. You are all worthless.
they actually passed Zika funding and dems shot it down. Shame on you for pandering. Your better then that.
Get rid of them
Hey Liz! Don't worry, after Trump takes WH and GOP hold the Hill, you will see lots of work and progress!
7 weeks..... More like 7 years.
@ckkoch3 @SenateGOP vote blue...vote and get America back...
Thanks for the clearest voice in the land. Much admired.
How can senate justify 7 weeks of PAID summer vacation, when most US workers get much less PER YR or none at all?
Best job with the most paid vacation days.
nope. #Senate didn't do their job. Get off it and work together.
blue days 75%are there but there intelligence  isn't
do they work when they're there?
@Senate @Congress @MSNBC @ABC @CBS @NBC @FoxNews Senate & Congress Worked How Many Days? 7 Weeks Off!

Plz @SenWarren let @SenateGOP @GOP @AP go on #Recess as they want; they do more harm than good 2 the American ppl whenever they off #Recess
Did Senate Dem's not get the 7 week break too...???  Didn't see any of you doing anything other than campaign for Hill
The same break Senae Dem's took?? https://democrats.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2016-Senate-Calendar.jpg …
Senate*
http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/senate-zika-bill-democrats-226671 …
"Democratic senators blocked legislation that would provide $1.1 billion to deal with the virus’ rise..."
$1.1 billion primarily for mosquito control, vaccines,diagnostics no funding for condoms nor contraceptives.
What a disgrace!!!
DEPLORABLE
#SenateDaysOff No work gets done there or not-Samma Thinga #Ridiculousness #VoteBernie
...and some won't tell us who they support, or how they will vote on important issues...
Yes Elizabeth, our Congressionals are the US's Royals.  Their better than the rest of us.
what did u do in those 7 weeks to help?
wish I got paid over $150k and got ur vacation time. Instead I struggle to make ends meet.
GOOD, limits damage that the government will do!
It is time for #President to invoke a special session of #Congress & force these elected welfare recipients to work!
you are part of the senate and took the same vacation. In fact you voted for it.
I need to be a Senator @CoryBooker can I get your job when you retire?
Don't you realise how many Senators need to hold down a 2nd job to meet their bills? They need the extra time off. 
Thought I recognised a Senator working in Dunkin' Donuts. Pity they're taking summer jobs from students.
When do you actually do anywork?  Geez
But they need time to work on their golf handicap! & reassure constituents how much they're getting done!
its no wonder the senate isn't interested in paid leave for parents when they can take a 7 week paid vacation.
Young people of child bearing age should be paying attention to how Republican party in Congress won't fund ZIKA
Doesn't this happen every year? I'm sorry your party doesn't have enough votes to do anything. #sillywarren
Bill and Hillary Clinton---are both DEPLORABLE for what they've done to black people

Example  http://s1.zetaboards.com/Express_Yourself/topic/5942296/1/ …
Please vote the obstructionists out .Let's get this country working again for the people,not the corrupt Gop.All of em
The Democrats in the Senate blocked the Zika vote 3x. Nice try at lying again.
like her or not, she's absolutely RIGHT on this issue!
in old days there wasn't a break. Paid well. Now paid to much!
Then they wonder why their stuck with Trump! Worthless! At our expense !
Vote the GOP out of office! They have done nothing since Obama was elected! Vote them out!
please do not use the New England Patriots motivation as a weapon for your stupid tweets. Fake native American
I just assume when they do show up its all Netflix and chill
WHY in the world would they do anything that helps actual Americans #doyourjob
I agree #DoYourJob
DEMS BLOCKED ZIKA over the PP MURDERERS..And SCOTUS will be TRUMPS CHOICE! 
Ah the schedule of an aristocracy, with time to catch summers fleeting glow. Not like having them there is helping.
I bet they still got paid.
government OF the people - not FOR or BY
I wish the dems and repubs would all take a permanent vacation @SenWarren @SenateGOP
Wish that I had a job with that much time off.... And the pay that goes with it!!  #DoYourJob #WePayYourSalary
And they should reimburse the American people for time wasted campaigning. #MoneyOut #GOTV
NO WORK NO PAY
time for taking back the Senate turn it blue and as many as we can in the House as well
What were you going to do for working families?
#DoYourJob
It's September. We got through mosquito season without widespread disaster. #Distractions. #DNCLeak
have you checked with the @Patriots and Belichick about stealing the #DoYourJob meme? :)
Why do they get so much paid time off. Average Americans don't We need to pay them less since they only work part time
That's odd, I remember my senator @PattyMurray voting no on Zika
And they bitch that teachers don't work enough
- I would love a Zika proposal that both the Senate and Puerto Rico can compromise on.
.@SenWarren @SenateGOP LAZIEST GOP SENATE AND CONGRESS ever.   Worked fewest days; DID zip. THROW THEM OUT!
this is what people should be protesting...
Red days = days Hillary was recovering
Women cant even take off 7 FU**ING WEEKS WHEN WE HAVE A BABY!!!!!
Oh Shut up.
speak for yourself.
Where do I sign up for a job that I make 6 figures, and get half the year off..
Yep! 7 weeks! SEVEN!! While people die! Make all that money, pay no Fu**ing TAXES and they take off SEVEN WEEKS!!
Working families would be better off if Obama didn't bring debt to 20 trillion.Do you know how many zero in a trillion
paying for Bush's wars and Recession have been expensive. https://www.thebalance.com/national-debt-under-obama-3306293 …
I'd like a 7 week paid vacation
I remember when GOP had house and senate under Bush, work week was 20 hrs a week tops, long "vacations".
Thank you for this graphic Ms.Warren
no worries Liz, they will pay dearly come #Election2016 . #theamericanpeople will not forget 8 years of obstructionism
Voting BLUE across the board for the first time EVER...Proud as hell to do so!!! #VoteBLUE
Surprise, surprise...
