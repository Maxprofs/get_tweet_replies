And when he doesn’t? And when they don’t? What next?
Impeach when he breaks the Emoluments clause, which is inevitable if he does not divest.
Senator Warren proved the Emoluments clause is not applicable when she introduced a bill to make it so.
If so, I’d love to see House disagree & push it. (Also not sure that rises to the level of “proves.”) @NucularOrms @SenWarren
Actually it does prove one day Warren says one thing and Next the opposite.
Well, since she HASN’T called for impeachment, it proves nothing. :) @NucularOrms @SenWarren
It's sad watching the grasping of straws. Offer alternatives that all Americans can agree.
Man, I wish ANYONE could come up with that! I can’t think of anything “all Americans can agree” on, sadly.
not gonna happen Pocahontas.
wow you're really an idiot
OK I have to admit that is kind of funny
umm no. Hey her lies brought it on herself. Who does that? An unstable person and THAT IS @SenWarren
Can't he be sued for ethical conflicts?  If so, why wouldn't you just keep suing him until he divests?
if you knew the law you wouldn't ask that question. Do some homework
I just did. Congressional law isn't my profession.. You seem to know, so please enlighten me.
The president is not bound by conflict of interest laws. Pretty basic pretty simple
Misspelled memes don't add much to your argument. Just saying. Try harder.
haha that's all you got? Pretty sad.
Please Senator Warren, don't let the vote for approval pass for Donald Trump's inauguration!!! DEMS WALK OUT!!!
The solution is clear.  Obama should balance the Federal budget.  If he won't Congress must require it.
yeah but we know he won't do it so what will you guys do. Rusia owns us now
Yes, Trump has shown a history of not wanting to receive more money. Sure.
@santo_aol @realDonaldTrump Elizabeth please move to impeach him.
Congress MUST start investigations vis a vis the Foreign Gifts Clause. We need to get it in the courts ASAP.
Trumpshould not be President. Multiple ties to Russia.
he has no ties with Russia. The one that's has  ties with Russia is Hillary
Cathy you don't believe the US intelligence agencies but believe Putin???
TRUMP HAS MORE CLASS & LOVE FOR AMERICANS THAN ANY OF YOU LIBERAL DECEIVERS ! YOU USE RACE TO CAUSE CONFLICT
Trump already explained what he is doing and so did the attorney. Your point?
The point is that the plan they outlined doesn't resolve the problems at all.
The attorney explained and it actually does legally.
OGE Director Shaub begs to differ. https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170111_oge_shaub_remarks.pdf …
Not true. Trump is fine. It is done . Get over the dem loss. Go on  your merry way. Get over it
It will not be done until he and his cronies are no longer in power. Trump is a disaster that just keeps growing.
You should have tried getting Killary and Obama. Barking up wrong tree. Keep harping and I will block
How dare I continue pointing out that the President elect has serious financial conflicts! Shame on me!
The American people are completely satisfied with the plan layed out by President Trump! He & R's control gov't!
Land does not vote. Counties don't vote. Humans do, and nearly 3 million more voted for the woman. DT "won" by 350,000 votes in 4 states.
President Trump won 56% of the vote & 30 states-R's control all of gov't! Lastly, Huge mandate!
On what planet? Popular vote: Clinton 48% Trump 46%. See http://cookpolitical.com/story/10174 
: Ms Warren:  Did you not see President Trump's new conference, 1-11-2017? He did.  ~  L
you mean the one where he treated seasoned world class reporters like school children?
If one is world class reporting then that person's reputation is honored. No honors w/lying. ~  L
@drkdhoffman @realDonaldTrump are all your holdings in a blind trust. The country needs to come together and support Mr Trump
Senator Warren is already bound by and complies with government ethics laws. She has nothing more to prove.
WHY?? Why should he possibly destroy his LIFE TIMES work JUST because he wants to serve we the people? He doesn't have to
Keep fighting! #Warren2020
Sen Warren how come that trump is above the law? Why are the GOP leaders protecting him?
The people voted on it already. Trump won. Let it Be Losers. Go to your crying room or pet a puppy or somethilng
Who won has nothing to do with conflicts of interest. It's unacceptable by  any standard
hey Warren you should step down for not knowing Constitution POTUS VPOTUS  exempt. 2 question 5 min max DEMe 
Please Elizabeth. You are such a sellout and lost all cred when you became besties with the corrupt Clintons.
WHY are you not boycotting 1/20???
I'm pessimistic with his spineless @SenateGOP footmen doing his bidding. Thank God for E. Warren #resisttrump
Okay, when?
I don't believe that @SenWarren is a legitimate US Senator. A liar abt her heritage and $350k 2 teach one class!
'@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Trumps ultimate realisation of luxury for the happy few:  #Trump #inequality #Dubai
Warren Buffett lives on $100,000 a year. He manages money he does not spend it.
Glad and grateful you are pushing this. We cannot let our democracy become a kleptocracy! Thank you!
Read the constitution. He is NOT required to. He is being generous by doing it of his own volition.
Tell me again Warren how many millionaires are in congress.. yet you all scream about Trump #draintheswamp
He won't; and so it becomes your duty and that of your colleagues to keep the heat on him!
ur running for president and u said this shit?
Teump Has a responsibility to the brand but you don't understand money just look at your cities
cry baby
singing to the choir
mrs warren your so far out in left field ?when are you going to get something right ?
Lady, u r ridiculous. U R NOT the President-elect, nor will u ever be. U R embarrassing harassing Ben Carson!!
Doesn't Congress already require it?
Like Clintons & Kennedys ?
Congress does give a shit about the people. They just do the minimum to stay in power for the good healthcare
What are you smoking? 
how can Americans make a President divest of business entanglements?
Where was your concern about conflict of interest re:  #ClintonFoundation pay-to-play self-enrichment? @realDonaldTrump
stop fighting and get on board with @realDonaldTrump please. Where are your assest right now? Are they in a blind trust? LINK.
WHY???
you put your assets in a blind trust how un american of you to demand others what to do with there money! #fail
@sashaalexander @realDonaldTrump legally he doesn't have too!
trump did put in trust for his boys their noting wrong with that. Hillary lost get over it
Much respect for you, grateful for your tenacity. Please keep fighting for those with no voice.
go back to your tee pee
>@SenWarren Keep whining. After the 2018 elections your din will lessen. We ain't done yet. #CUN2018 #MAGA  @realDonaldTrump
There is no conflict of interest for presidents. You're disgusting.
#DonaldTheMoralCompass
you are a racist going against a black man for a cabinet position
so I can assume Fauxcahonits sold all her stocks when she took office?
Here u go projecting again @SenWarren. @realDonaldTrump did it anyway despite NOT having 2 do it. What else Pocahontas? @sashaalexander
You should learn what a blind trust is. Trump didn't come close to putting his assets in a blind trust.
BLAH BLAH BLAH.. @realDonaldTrump  has done more than required @torque. He's ur Prez like it or not.  @SenWarren @sashaalexander
Massachusetts resident senator. Proud of you keep up the good work. Keep his feet to the fire.
you people the vote for warren  live in la la land
And we like it that way!
@thinker128 @realDonaldTrump Demand that he releases his taxes!
He's probably going to be inaugurated. Then all of USA will wish he had not been allowed to take office. Watch.
pay what you owe US, or  DIEvest because CIVIL SERVANT salaries are public record, Mr. Selfish-Serve
@MAHAMOSA @realDonaldTrump You can't require it.  The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 precludes your requiring it.  But you knew that.
congress must impeach if he fails to comply how can he trample over our laws with such disdain.
Every member of Congress should be required to do this too then!! What's good for goose is good for gander too!
@gemssim @realDonaldTrump He already said he won't. And we've not seen his taxes. How can this all even be allowed?
@glwoods3377 @realDonaldTrump 
And the American people demand to see his taxes!

so what exactly have you done lately that could even come close to the senator since you criticize
furthermore I want to know what trump is going to do for you? lol
Go find a teepee and a pipe and smoke dope.
Don't go to the inauguration. Or go & wear a big Hillary or Bernie button. Being there you count as a supporter.
- he isn't smart enough. Maybe his cronies can help. God help us all!
there is only one way forward .. Stop his business interest and start acting like a President ! Get real DJT, Putin's Puppet !
We MUST HAVE TERM LIMITS for SENATORS!!!  Do you agree, Senator @SenWarren?  We have term limits for our POTUS!
trump will never release them, do what you gotta do.
Good luck with that...don't see lots of cooperation for that requirement in Congresses future. Thug for majority leader..and blind mice!
@pamMOvotes EMPIRE for foreign investors in RUSSIA and other foreign countries
@pamMOvotes and you sure as hell can't sell companies that you don't own, it's called running and operating a MONEY LAUNDERING
@pamMOvotes WHEN the hell will the AMERICAN people and members of CONGRESS understand ,you can't DIVEST what you don't own and
what he needs to do is reduce the size of government & operate a tight budget like business. Govmt is wasteful
Senator, you are an embarrassment to ALL Americans. Please resign now.
You look pretty stupid making all these demands you can't back up. @realDonaldTrump
The solution is clear: Those Senators who lie about their white heritage to take a minority slot should resign.
ya warren did lie
I am with you, Senator Warren.
give him hell !! Trump we the people loathe you!
Stop posing Pocahontas and give back the native money you stole!! @realDonaldTrump
Love how u criticized him, but look at $ he is already saving the govmt by dealing w/co's on giving btr prices b4 he takes office
The solution is clear: #FireHer Massachusetts voters hired a pathological liar with severe mental issues to run their state.
not required he has already met the law requirements and Congress will not require anymore.
I forget. Which part of the Constitution requires that or empowers congress to so require it?
He does NOT have to. President & VP exempt, look it up
@mercy2you @realDonaldTrump Are we being asked to trust blindly?
@ruckawriter @realDonaldTrump Say "We want Pre-Nup!"
We are about to get a dose when the party of the one tenth of one percent fills the swamp and controls congress

#NOtrump #stopsessions @SenateFloor WE demand 1. Taxes, 2. Birth certificate 3. DIVESTMENT 4. Psych. Exam!, or NO inauguration!!! https://twitter.com/naacp/status/819932671124140032 …
GOP not likely to do anything to anger him. ABSOLUTE POWER
Sen Warren, u have cashed in more on the backs of down-trodden Americans than anyone else in govt. #nastywoman
@mckelvey_patti THERE is NO WAY he can b INAUGURATED LIKE THIS, @SenateDems GET support from Supreme Court & @POTUS!
.@gop are corrupt, it will never happen.
@SenWarren @MikeFitzburg @realDonaldTrump
Was he forced to run? If he didn't do his homework before why must the people pay again? Conflicts abound.
Hey Pocahontas, where were your demands of HRC while she was lining her pockets at State and her crap foundatio
Sen Warren while you are concerned about PEOTUS $$$ perhaps someone should be investigating where you got your $
@MarleneUsaa1 PLS vote NO so WE dont pay for trumps wall. He lied again, let him pay 4 it. Mexico wont reimburse
that is just one of many things
don't recall this type of commotion around Dick Chaney?
B.S., you're done, Elections Have Consequences, Get over yourself! YOU LOST!
Look at whose calling the kettle black the FAKE INDIAN to further her own career #1 liar & got rich frm flipping forclosed homes
The difference between Trump and u LibCreeps, is he earned his money, u stole it from the taxpayers!
No President is required to do any of that. BTW would you give profits of any kind to the Treasury??  I doubt it
cant do it hes done nothing illegal
@mjhawley How likely Congress will have the spine?
please protect and strengthen the office of Ethics!
His followers are definitely in a blind trust. They trust him blindly. Very cultlike.
So the Warren law would specify that no spouse or child or relative of a politician can own a private business?
Are you holding yourself 2 the same standard?
Democrats set the standard. Huma Abedin worked for both the State Department and the Clinton Foundation
I'm not convinced Congress is able to stand up to this bully. #Resist
No Trump doesn't have to act on what you think he should do.
Read the law the president and the Vice President are exempt. He is not taking a Salary to be President
Are you taking a Salary for your job Senator.
you HYPOCRITE!
#draintheswamp
rather funny then sell all of your assets and discontinue your practices of passing law to make your pockets big
he's done everything lawfully required. U r not representing citizens properly.
Sen Warren the American people don't care how much money @realDonaldTrump has or makes, stop the political crap
You had one job with Carson and you can't do that right. Im embarrassed to be a woman with you serving.
Sen Warren why didn't you call for Hillary to put her millions of dollars from foreign Govts in blind trust ????
WE don't care. Creepy IRS would have leaked any wrong doing if there was any
What is your definition of a true blind trust? You don't seem to know very much about anything.Please quit destroying our country
- Read the law.  He doesn't have to do anything.  Why do you want to destroy America?  You are evil.
Thank you Sen Warren you are being heard by the people !
Please present a plan of consequence when he doesn't handle conflicts of interest to hold him accountable.
Want 2 c bill that wld require Warren 2 release employment applications 2 verify claim of Native American status
Not gonna happen! Congress don't dare to loose power and wealth. Congress = Replublicans = Trump.
GOP not in business of ripping off HUD ... they have their OWN $$$$. 
Commies planting seeds to fool Sheeple 

@realDonaldTrump
Guess you missed Mr Trumps lawyer laying out his plans ... oh, wait ... you'll keep your plant seeds going

@realDonaldTrump
...
you are definitely NOT brightest light bulb in the Box. President is excluded by law from conflict of interest
if trump has to then do do you hypocrite give up all your money accept your senate pay @realDonaldTrump
I think Republicans are afraid of him. Feed the dragon whatever he wants and he won't eat US!
good thing you have no power Senator. Because you make no sense. Donate your salary to US debt. Loser.
@MAHAMOSA @realDonaldTrump    Lyin Liz should read the constitution--assuming she can read at all--
agreed
They can't require what the Constitution doesn't. Have you ever read the Constitution? You're not real bright.
and Congress is beholden to the people/history to have this in place before the 21st!
I think impeachment is knocking on @realDonaldTrump door already
@jimmyj48125 @realDonaldTrump keep fighting Ms Warren.  The country needs you to do so.  Elucidate please,  how can we help you?
#UniteBlue
@jimmyj48125 He won't do it.  He thinks being POTUS makes him omnipotent.


Trump shouldn't be president!
Don't think that's the solution

The solution is listening to Americans who rejected leftist American Indian imposters like you!
If he holds RE assets: he knows where they are & to whom the debt. Without divestment, can't b true blind trust
Congress can't require it. And you know that. By spewing garbage you have no credibility when u say these things
his sons can't be in charge of his trust, can they? I'm still waiting for the press conference on Dec 15, 2016.
we love u Sen Warren keep up the pressure
Hello.....He doesn't have to do anything and it all started with the first pres. Washington.
What Pres Elect proposes is sufficient enough I would like all politicians to stop taking cash gifts
lots of luck. Once again u r running ur  about things u know u cannot change To hear ur self When r u going to do something
LOL, the real solution is for you to get a job and stop wasting taxpayer money so you can fantasize your intelligence.
Sen warren, Keep up the fight! Make Trump follow accountable for his actions!!
PROUD OF YOUR WORK!
impeachment hearings
@tkdmike @realDonaldTrump they won't because they're the borg collective and just follow each other lockstep
u r so jealous he got in. Ruined ur plans bc u wld have been a cabinet nominee 4 @HillaryClinton
u can't make law bc he is POTUS 1st bc u r directing it at him & pres & vp were already exempt. Prejudice

impeach him immediately if he breaks any rules
@areyou0 @realDonaldTrump He needs to produce his tax returns too! He is hiding something!!!
