SHUT UP LIER TRUMP IS REPEALING OBAMACARE NOT ACA
lol...the ignorant speak. They are same you twit.
also...the fact you can't spell "liar" is a little concerning as well. smh
Looks who's calling the tea kettle black lol
really...go to Trump U did ya?
if Trump can talk about helping common man after Trump U fraud, Sen Warren can say whatever she wants
Sen Warren aka Fake Pocahontas corruption is coming out
says the supporter of a president-elect to settle a $25M fraud claim! Ironic @pyrmomma @nsfraudbuster @SenWarren
Drinking your liberal tears is wonderful 
there's your mistake. We aren't crying. We're fighting. #TheResistanceIsReal
A day late and a dollar short. 
Keep fighting lol

Mr. Meme typical uneducated Trumpster!
the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing her idiot supporters she wasn't a hypocrite.
Please don't allow her a position.
The state is the only one who can push young kids into loans they can not pay so it can reap the interest and I.O.U.s?
for the love of god and for the sake of our children, do not confirm that dingbat!
Thank you Senator Warren!! You are amazing...keep fighting for our kids!
Her school choice will help more poor kids than your speech ever would.

typical Trumpster. Yawn.
You are an inspiration to me. Please continue fighting for us! Thank you
YOU shouldn't be in office #fraud. #fauxcahontas

#BetsyDeVos as a retired teacher, I am horrified to think about student learning, class size teacher salaries.
is Betsey going to be confirmed?  She's scary
if you don't think she is the right person for the position fine but you should still shake her hand if be respectful #dignity
great job questioning her today.
maybe b/c the tools and rules in place are broken? http://www.wsj.com/articles/whos-afraid-of-betsy-devos-1484352708 … also, all things considered, she has a track record
that are outperforming on public schools by almost a 5x multiplier. It's just a different system.
As was I but I don't base my entire religious experience on how I was educated.. and what I learned from school...
Fraud like...Lying on your law school application saying you're Native American?
@Liberallove1 @SenWarren @usedgov she's as dumb as Loretta Sanchez doing war whoops when meeting with People from India
# Yes!
https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/withdraw-nomination-betsy-devos-secretary-education-0 …
you couldn't even shake her hand!! WOW!!
anyone that doesn't have the HIGHEST LEVEL OF EDUCATION 4 ANY GOV APPOINTED POSITION SHOULD NOT HAVE IT
please fight this appointment with everything you have, the future of our children literally depends on it. 
@LeslieMarshall @usedgov 
She knows you already have it bugged..
we need change in our education system. We are not teaching what we should anymore.

Why don't you as a leader become part of trying to find solutions instead of creating dissection?
Nothing has convinced me more that the new cabinet positions were sold and bought to the highest bidder. #DeVosHearing
@realDonaldTrump  Did she fraudenltly claim a protected class heritage to get into a prestigious University? #publishyourdata
you are about the most ignorant self righteous woman with no respect towards others!You that much of a B you couldn't her hand??

Don't you have a job to do? Like trolling a bridge and not the internet?
the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing her idiot supporters she wasn't a hypocrite.
#ultimatePayToPlay #realDonaldTrump #BetsydeVos just bought herself a Cabinet post
Agree we can do better!
keep up the good work - I am afraid for our public schools with #BetsyDeVos at the helm
and if you are robbing the poor by flipping bankrupt houses with your bro #youshouldntbeinpolitics
Is this why you were rude and unprofessional when refusing to shake her hand?
That's rich, Sen Warren is the only fraud here.
Ok Pocahontas.
You are a liar you lied about being an Indian on your college entrance forms you need to resign
"used gov" is an appropriate twitter handle
thank you Sen. Warren!
.@SenWarren THANK YOU for exposing #BetsyDeVos as completely inexperienced and unequipped to lead @usedgov. We are grateful & proud. #savage
@elizabethforma Here's a glaring example of your arrogance & condescension & why most Americans hate you
@elizabethforma Let's talk about your hypocrisy & corruption     https://www.google.com/amp/www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/judicial-watch-announces-list-of-washingtons-ten-most-wanted-corrupt-politicians-for-2012/amp/?client=safari …
@elizabethforma You can't be serious...https://www.google.com/amp/s/trueliberalnexus.wordpress.com/2012/09/28/elizabeth-warrens-lies-catching-up-with-her/amp/?client=safari …
Why not shake her hand Pocahontas? You are a petty nit wit
thank you, Elizabeth Warren  good job!
#BetsyDeVos  I won't approve her
There are hormones available for your condition.  Look into the bio-identical type.  
#nastywoman
does @usedgov have a tool for people who fraudulently claim a protected status for Admissions? #askingforafriend
pocahontas
her family has done enough damage to education in Michigan. The other 49 states don't need this #StopDeVos
I agree!
Why are you tweeting? Shouldn't you send smoke signals? Hack
R U suggesting that every Ed Secretary leading up to Betsy has stopped ALL fraud and abuse? Give me a break.
Do you do anything to HELP America by reaching across the aisle? Just interested in sound bites. Can't even shake hands. No class
@elizadushku Shouldn’t even have Dept of Education. Education is not one of fed gov’s enumerated powers in Article I, Section 8.
thank you and Sen @alfranken  for your forthright questions which exposed DeVos ignorance.
please stop her and the other Trump puppets for taking positions of leadership in our Whitehouse.
I agree
don't you have something better to do than tweet?
@kevinkcahill @usedgov
From now on when someone is talking to me abt something I'm clueless on, gonna say "thank you, Senator, for asking that question" #DeVos
@elizadushku @usedgov  well should she have not read the cliff notes prior to hearings on idea or educational buzzwords
THANK YOU for everything you've done in DC, and continue to do. You are a nasty woman too!! <3

WHY SHOULD SHE?  You clearly didnt demand the same of @HillaryClinton  using a .gov acct as sec of state! HYPOCRITE
@JustWhatNowWhy @usedgov @#hearingDvos
you shouldn't be in the Senate, but...
amongst a myriad of other reasons.
Real class act refusing to shake the hand of a cabinet nominee. What a role model for young people you are. SMH
our schools suck, why use ANY resources of a failed system??
Always Knew you were a mean person Today you proved your pure evil and in 2018 you will be gone
lets hope so. What a joke. She put a show on for the cameras. Vote them all out.
since you lue when using the tools, we should impeach you for fraud
thank you #lieahontas
did you ?
DeVos probably doesn't even know such resources exist, because grizzly bears or something....
she won't use tools because she has never had to use one in her life. She had servants for that. So beneath her...
Nice to meet you to pokeherinthehants
If you don't have the decency to shake a person's hand than you should just leave. How RUDE.
 You and your party lost. 

#GetOverIt
#ActLikeAnAdult
among all the other reasons! Woefully unqualified
thank you for standing up for students!
thank you for your steadfast no nonsense approach. I have been discouraged since the election. Listening to you gives me hope.
have you seen  this ? https://www.google.com/amp/s/static.theintercept.com/amp/trump-education-nominee-betsy-devos-lied-to-the-senate.html?client=safari …
Agree. This is not, in any way, ok.
THE FRAUD IS THESE LIBERAL COLLEGES WHO OVER-CHARGE. NO DIFFERENT THAN TRUMP U . STUDENTS OUGHT TO SUE THEM AS WELL
Nobody takes Warren seriously, because she's always so rude, and condescending. She goes through life pissed off.
all I can say is THANK U. She wasn't prepared and doesn't have the knowledge required for the job & u proved that!
U are so right about that ELIZABETH WARREN
I understand completely why you split from the Hearing. It's not every day the Senate restaurant serves pemmican and beaver tail.
Yes.  Senator Warren, Ms DeVos shoukd have claimed to be Native American like the honest lying people do.
There are many, many, reasons.
3/3 Pell grants?  Obama gutted the Pell grant program under his administration.   All facts . Stop lying.
2/3 for profit college fraud has run rampant under YOUR'S and Obama's watch.  You can't defend that.
speaking of fraud,  pot calling the kettle black pocahontas?  YOU  fraudulently claimed native American status. 1/3
I heard her string a sentence together, I don't need another reason.

based on her testimony there. Are many reason for her not to be confirmed#stupidisone
Your lack of common decency & respect for another human being was on full display as U refused to shake hands w/Ms Devos
complete low life
She's going to be appointed. Get over yourself.
Only fraud I see is you!!!
Thank you.
Speaking of "FRAUD" Liz YOU'RE the phony "Indian" trying FRAUD of university & US Govt. for tuition "free"Hypocrite
You were amazing today Sen.Warren!!! My hero!!!

Pocahontas, afraid of someone who is going to take on useless teachers unions? Maybe want to help kids so you are against that.
@monicasloves @usedgov she has absolutely no qualifications except her money. Do Not Confirm.
AGREE
deVos will never support public education. Trying to make education a business will never work--that seems to her model
If you don't have the common courtesy and respect to shake Ms. DeVos hand, you shouldn' be a State Senator. I vote.
Your hypocrisy is unbelievable.
please save us. I'm so scared for my kids future!
speaking of education, you ma'am should have some class!maybe @BetsyDeVos can give you a lesson on respect #whysosalty
#BetsyDeVos shouldn't be the Secretary of Education #FixedThatForYou
you madam shouldn't be a senator !
YOU Shouldn't be a Senator, you should be held to the fire for lying FAUXAHANTAS
you have no class. Surprised that "with your Native American upbringing" that you are so classless. #fauxohantas
don't confirm
Thank you for your questioning! From many public school families, teachers, administrators, and staff in NY state cc@usedgov
please talk sense into anyone voting for her
such a fraud u are- your whole life is based on a lie
yea u don't get to talk to anyone about fraud
Among several other objections we could raise!!!
Just because you disagree with her view on prioritizing issues or the proper role of Feds in edu., does not make her unqualified.
You are rude and classless. Even @alfranken shook hands. You are an intolerant person.
you're a fraud tho chief "charges too much to teach one class" you don't care about students just yourself.
@BetsyDeVos lack of IDEA knowledge terrifies me as a special needs parent. She better study up  https://www2.ed.gov/policy/speced/guid/idea/idea2004.html …
what's that say about u who scammed system by exploiting ur HUGELY exaggerated Native American background n got free schooling?
Political differences r 1 thing, but u honestly believe u r better than common folks. That's why u will NEVER b POTUS.
She isn't qualified, however can we please stop vilifying ALL for profit ed? There is a place for #tradeschools
You showed your complete and utter lack of class by not shaking Ms. DeVos' hand. Actions like this r why Trump won.
"say it!"
and you are powerless to stop her thanks to the American voter! #MAGA
Thank you and Dems for outing DeVos for being totally unfit
#DeVos's brother Erik Prince conspired with Trump, Guilliani and the FBI. PLEASE READ IMMEDITAELY
Please don't confirm this nominee!
REASON #13
Please find and work with enough Republican senators to get DeVos NOT confirmed
can the Democrats stop Ryan from taking SS and Medicare
@Daninmich @usedgov 

Says Warren as though she actually knows anything or cares.      So very biased
She's just like all of Trump's clown pics...and Trump himself... Completely unqualified.
ever since that nasty feet speech she is revolting to me
you asked great questions as did @SenFranken and @timkaine and she fumbled and deflected and is unqualified. No to devos

I find it so funny that you actually believe to poop you are spewing ! This is the problem with you people !
she shouldn't be cleaning toilets
there isn't room to describe all the reasons why she shouldn't be Secretary of Education. She was disgraceful yesterday
This person ---> @SenWarren is a fraud. @usedgov
and you should not attend a treasonist inaugural?Really? You and Bernie? Really? DONT DO IT!
Pocahontas twisted words for her own agenda. You are not out for what is best for America--you are out for Pocahontas!
Quess what? She will be confirmed!
.@SenWarren @usedgov What qualifies you to make that assessment? More worried abt Union donations than kids choice for schools/education.
@WSCP1 @SenWarren @usedgov I feel native American studies are still essential, don't you @SenWarren ?
exactly why she should, Warren
not shaking Betsy DeVos's  hand when offered, showed your constituents how pathetic you really are.
Saw you refuse to shake Betsy's hand.  You are the scumbag they say.  A classless, rude liar, Pocahantas Warren.
@Patriotvnvet @7kidchaos @SenWarren @usedgov @rlockrocks
shut up Elizabeth...
Hillary would not use a gov server 
Babs, rather than tearing down DeVos, you better start worrying about your '18 reelection. Mr. Schilling is coming for America!
So sorry the brilliant @BetsyDeVos had to suffer you leftwing fools yesterday. #Sad
Brilliant? I don't think you were watching the same hearing as the rest of us.
Hard 2 answer convoluted ?? not based in fact. Many irrelevant. Besides, doesn't matter what Dems think.
You're right all that matters to you is that they're confirmed, either qualified or not. Thanks for confirming that.
I think it's so awesome that DT has been able to convince a bunch of billionaires to lend us their expertise & serve the US.
And as a fake Indian, you certainly know a lot about "tools", right Fauxcahontas?
