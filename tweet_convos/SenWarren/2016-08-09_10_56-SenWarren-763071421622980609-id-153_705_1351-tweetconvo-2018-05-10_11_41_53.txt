Another liberal who thinks businesses competing is businesses cheating.
@renaemerle I agree with Sen. Warren, if you can't pay your taxes here, you cant sell your product here at a higher $
@renaemerle http://bit.ly/2bqDdZt 
And I imagine @USChamber will vote for HRC, who was one of their best allies when she voted for all those trade deals.
@washingtonpost Pocahontas is a hypocrite. You support #CrookedHillary aka Wallstreet
@renaemerle
Even ostensibly “progressive” think tanks like the Center for American Progress have cozied up to corporate backers. http://buff.ly/2b8fXn6 
only interested in Big-Everyone and minimal for small biz
Communist Red China who else.?  @StateDept @JohnKerry @RichardTrumka @HillaryClinton @POTUS

Be glad Hill Baby is running against that Orange #Chumpanzie , or she Would, be LOOSING.
#LiarsInPoliticsMeans!
And when YOU endorse a KNOWN, PROVEN, LIAR, then your JUDGEMENT must be QUESTIONED! 
U were my hereo, now politican

NOTHING YOU SAY CAN BE BELIEVED! 

That's the Problem with Goverment.
Never Froget, YOU CHOSE GREED OVER OUR NEEDS by Endorsing Hill Baby...

Now we have 2 Liars
If Chump wasn't running, I would say you sound Hypocritical talking about Money Loving People, YET, you endorsed one
@renaemerle delete you account Lizzie. You make women look bad. You are a has been that never made it and never will!
They pay public officials hundreds of thousands over and over again before they are Mark Twain quality speaker or not?
@renaemerle Who funds you Pocahantes?
@washingtonpost keep it up #PocahontasWannabe
@washingtonpost Build a financial wall to keep those funds in USA. Maybe we can make them pay for it too.. Lol
@washingtonpost Wow! That just went right over a few heads. It makes me sick, citizens paying 35% and the rich  0%.
everything you say is weakened by your endorsement of hrc. you lost your integrity cred.
@renaemerle ru inciting violence? With your tomahawk? Go back to your reservation with your kind
your a no class act, back off of Trump why would you back someone who breaks the laws explain that
Just everyday Americans who run businesses and are tired of being screwed because of your failed policies.
@washingtonpost rhetorical question
@renaemerle it breaks my heart to lose another role model but history WILL remember #DemExit
@renaemerle Yet you support Hillary who takes large donations from Wall Street & big businesses. Hypocrite
Sen. Warren your commission CFPB unfittingly is not working# 160531-000016 Leslie Bright/Iowa is lazy ! !
@HillaryClinton work's for the same people. You should've endorsed @SenSanders. #JillNotHill
@washingtonpost WTH!
Like @HillaryClinton and You do.
@realDonaldTrump https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv0HddQPdbM …  OK chamber who do you work for? Snipers chemical WMD? #growup
@renaemerle @realDonaldTrump is working for "we the people" unlike the Senate Democrats who blocked the bill for Zika
@washingtonpost As a small business owner in Illinois, who champions for me. Elizabeth Warren, that's who.
Just everyday american who want to move because you keep screwing them over. Your exit tax plan is a disaster
@renaemerle maybe if we had term limits, REAL budget cuts where needed, and stop piggybacking on bills, good will come
@washingtonpost who does clinton work for..big banks,big pharm,big corps, and big wall street, y would ne1 vote 4 her
@washingtonpost That's a very good question, corporations helping the U.S. or just themselves
They are nothing but a Union for Corporations, better paid thugs working for them in Congress
thats thx to you MF in Washington who raised biz taxes to 35%@USChamber @washingtonpost
- it's just unfair I tells ya!
Why don't you just worry about how to quit spending other people's money instead?
There's a big problem with sm. biz trying to get product thru customs, too. Big biz created laws to prevent it and killed sm. biz
@washingtonpost 
Hey Pocahontas...ask your friend Hillary about her wall street friends and their hiding of funds.
It about time, go get them and make them bring their money back to the United States where they made it.
@renaemerle 
Chamber of commerce works for bottom line lobbyist whom lobby congress stalemate legislation from vote.
@renaemerle Just like your buddy Hillary. Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Secret Service should investigate Trump for making a death threat against Clinton. D.J.Trump suggested someone kill Clinton.
@renaemerle rumor has it you are donating all of your money to charity so everyone will finally believe your motives
@renaemerle    They also work well with @HillaryClinton but hate @realDonaldTrump   That should tell us something.
@washingtonpost that is one scary goblin
@renaemerle This regulation would be gone in a Trump Adm.
They must get Hedge Fund $$ somehow....Don't worry HRC will FIGHT THEM. Look Here ! http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/04/15/hillary-clintons-attack-on-hedge-fund-managers-includes-her-son-in-law-marc-mezvinsky/ …

@washingtonpost So is it a stall until law can change? Hope it works.
@renaemerle If it isn't obvious by now, Donohue will give you a clear answer -- he's been at the helm long enough
@washingtonpost 
When will we discuss this...

http://www.FlipHero.com 
and yet even @USChamber doesn't support @realDonaldTrump because he's too dangerous on trade and too friendly to corporations!
@renaemerle Who in the hell do you work for. It is not the the American public. You live off their tax dollars.
@renaemerle Can't blame companies that follow the law. You can blame & change  #Washington by #voting for #leadership
@renaemerle are there any ideas on to how to fill the skilled labor (trades) job openings?
I agree with @senwarren @uschamber this overseas tax havens non sense needs to stop. Enough is enough.
Question is why the laws are such that big corporations get away with doing that? Is there role of $225K speeches, etc
And yet you support Hillary Clinton. Your political calculations make you lose credibility, and makes you a hack.
@washingtonpost ..still 
How about both of you start working for the people. Drug testing doesn't work!

@SenWarren @USChamber
Hey I know that guy! http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-naiman/chamber-of-commerce-lobby_b_9104096.html …

Ooops?! lol
the work for your open Borders BS @USChamber @renaemerle
@washingtonpost 
Chamber has gone from pro-business to outright crazy. USC needs to get an anus extractus done.
@renaemerle Sounds like the woman you endorsed for president.
@renaemerle But DT wants deregulation
of course it has
@washingtonpost #Hillary Clinton
Actually @HillaryClinton the profits aren't hidden overseas there washed through the #ClintonFoundation but yes we get the taxes.
#ElizabethWarren’s critique of @HillaryClinton’s #HillaryClinton 2001 bankruptcy vote. #Tatiana
As a result of your policies. You work for the people of MA. How much have you done for us?
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugggggghhhhhhhh!
#really
@washingtonpost that's because Obama save this economy he gets no credit for it history will vindicate him
The money that these companies make needs to stay here. Moving headquarters overseas to evade taxes is unpatriotic
What are you going to do? Force them to stay? How about incentives to stay?
just because you give them tax breaks and other incentives does not mean that they will create jobs
The Exit tax will just be paid by other countries. High taxes will be the incentive to leave. Regulation helps big buisness
How corporate America bought H for $21M. #Ohio #Florida #Wisconsin #Virginia #Colorado #Pennsylvania
@nypost corporate America has bought all politicians from pres down to state legislators. Trump is part of corporate A
Wholly-owned subsidiary of the GOP, without even a pretense of bipartisanship.
more hot flashes from the menopause madam
The same that Hillary works 4! lets really see where her money came and comes from.What u say is a joke!

Liz, and you are bought by Wall Street. #Tatiana
so she's fighting wall st. For wall st?
How can these companies make billions off-shore, pay no US Taxes and still contribute to US capaigns?
@washingtonpost This is, coincidentally, also who Congress works for.
@renaemerle this is the WArren we need. Afraid for ur life?  Body count mounting almost daily.
The template was set in the 1970s

#PowellMemo
@renaemerle please propose lowering the capital gains rate for small biz then. I would support that bill. Need it.
Small, not large, biz is the engine of job and economic growth. We must support them!
yup! Flat 12.5% for small biz, before the engine of the economy is crushed
Easy! Tax the rich and off-shore tax evaders fair share, then low taxes for small biz.
actually just lowering small biz rate would increase revenue because less would go out of biz
The increase in tax revenue by reducing taxes has never been substantiated.
has by me. When my rate was lower I spent more on talent. Used that to grow biz, paid more tax
Point was, we did it for big biz and it was a bust. Big biz just consolidates and pockets it.
we care because?
