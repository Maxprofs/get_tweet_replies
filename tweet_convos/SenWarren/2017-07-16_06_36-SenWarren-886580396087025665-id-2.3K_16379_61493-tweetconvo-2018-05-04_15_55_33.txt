Can we get names for the two who voted against this - might be telling who's in Putin's hip pocket as they dare to show their loyalty!
Oh it was def Bernie Sanders and I can't remember the other one.. A republican def but I can't remember
No it wasnt

Who was it then? And please provide a better source than the one I just provided, which is directly off the http://Senate.gov  website.
How's that source?
I'm still researching.
Ok this is just semantics. He DID vote against those sanctions. But for reasons that you stated.
We're you surprised bernie was one who voted against? Those of in the know weren't
This statement is the exact opposite of "in the know". Lol.
Bernie did not vote against this. Come on, people.

https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&session=1&vote=00144 …
He voted NO, to investigate #TrumpRussia . Vote was yes 98-2. Other no vote was Rand Paul. Got $27?
I already corrected my stmt in replies. He heavily endorsed russia sanctions, opposed iranian ones.
Your #singlepayernow gives u away, may as well say:I worship Bernie,while  rest of us live in the now t save #ACA so GOPdont cut 22mill ppl
I strongly support improving the ACA in opposition of Trumpcare.
Your profile says otherwise. What state do you live in?
Not sure, but I may be incorrect. There are 2 different Bills. My apologies if I am speaking to the wrong one. They were passed and 1/
That's the main point, I suppose. But I apologize if I am talking about something different than Senator Warren. 
https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&session=1&vote=00144 …
Wonder why @SenSanders voted against Russian sanctions? Mmmmmm....
Here is the link to the official Senate roll call. Has Sanders as a Yay. The Nays were Paul and Lee.

Thank you! Back at ya! I'm not afraid to apologize if I'm wrong. I know other people in this country who would benefit from that quality!
I swear there must be some coordinated effort to discredit Sanders here.  It's crazy.
He needs to be discredited! He's a divisive person out to assuage his own ego! He's the left's version of #tRump!!!
Oh, please. That was Obama who couldn't stand up to Putin.
Sure. That's why Putin installed Trump
Please tell me how Hillary lost a Russian rigged election.
Senator Warren is a real senator with a real backbone and real integrity.  She and people like her will save us from oligarchs raiding.
Took you long enough! Usually work so fast!?
Thank you so much for representing all Americans
Please do! The person currently in the office of president has been compromised.
No brainer
In which Trump trying 2 water down don't let the House of Representative get away with it stop Paul Ryan b/c he is Trump puppet
Meantime @SpeakerRyan holds up House #Russiansanctions bill at #Trump's request
If @realDonaldTrump will not stand up to Russia, the Senate will. We recently passed sanctions against Russia by a vote of 98-2.
Putin & his cronies wake up every morning and LAUGH at us for electing such FOOL! He's their puppet and they are enjoying every minute of it
Trump wakes up every morning and laughs at you democrats..
Looks like I struck a nerve!! The truth hurts!! Get used to it... much more to come to supporters of DT.. #NotMyPresident
She's a bot.
Who's a bot?
That Lisa chick.
I think you're right! Didn't hear from her after she was called out!
Yes but what is the house & Ryan doing now?
Please please run for POTUS
Not sure she can win. Has to be someone so far beyond reproach or someone so low ...... the high road has collapsed.
And respectfully, the smear tactic of those who are in any way socialist or left liberal past a certain point are booby trapped.
I just wanted to state for the twitter record, I find this disgusting.
That is such a relief to hear Senator Warren! Thanks 2 every last one of u. , America
And wasn't Bernie Sanders one of the 2? What's up with that.
Who are the 2 that voted against?
No, not Sanders. Paul and Lee. 
https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&session=1&vote=00144 …
https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&session=1&vote=00147 …
Who were the 2 Russia supporters?
Bernie Sanders and Rand Paul
Thank you- not the answer I was expecting.
And the 2 are traitors and need to leave the senate. Who were the 2?
Mike lee and rand paul
Actually it waw Bernie Sanders and Rand Paul
Liar.
Look it up.
https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&session=1&vote=00144 …
Thanks - i must be thinking of Russia Sanctions
think about, @realDonaldTrump knew of his sons meeting at Trump Tower & he had already begun putting in his
You act like it's a big deal that you finally did something. It's not special. It's your job. You're too old for a participation trophy. 
Means nothing.  House hasn't passed anything, and Trump won't sign an anti-Putin bill.
Bravo!!!
Paul Ryan is trying very hard to water down new U.S. sanctions on Russia.(608)752-4050 (202)225-0600 press *6.
:
supporters that the election was rigged. Ppl this is not a party problem this all our problem! It has hit HOME.
But if needs president loco signature then is dead.
@SpeakerRyan Are you, in the immortal words of Warren Zevon, "with the Russians too?" #SendLawyersGunsandMoney
@SenWarren Are we talking about the same senate that is made of 50 heartless, coward, Putin lover, WASP promoter republicans?
Thx!
Who were the two?
Thank you Senator Warren.  It's good to know some checks and balances are still alive in our country.

What is the status of this bill?  The @gop will kill it...they get too much $$ from Putin!
You do understand that the majority held in Senate is a slim margin and they overwhelmingly voted for it? Take a deep breath first.
Who were the 2 who voted against???
Rand Paul and Bernie
Wtf bernie!!
Well done!  Now would impeach these nefarious ba@@ards already so we can get back to taking care of the American ppl?!?! #IMPEACHTHEMALL
No one believes impeachment is possible...House GOP and Senate are not going to impeach their orange human signator
Eventually they will.  When they see 2018 looming & know they are going to lose.  But FIRST must ram thru all nefarious shit they can.
Who knows if our elections will even be secure by then? The orange despot is making things so bad we may have 2 call in UN election monitors
Which needed to come from the house first for it to really mean something. Tell the truth
Haha, just like you tell the truth, right Donnie? #CrookedDon
Please lay down and play dead....you're done in the next vote!!

But why is house sitting on it?
Obviously there are other Russian players in our government, not just in the executive branch...
, Love you!!
Stand up to Russia for what? Unfaithful & ungrateful mail-order brides? 
Trump is doing a great job
Why so worried about Russia and not about the crimes right here and do nothing about it
Hoping this is TRUE & when Team Mueller completes their investigations we will see 
INDICTMENTS IMPEACHMENTS IMPRISONMENTS
for all TRAITORS!
Curious if you are aware of this story,.. http://shareblue.com/house-intel-dem-warns-trump-could-issue-private-prospective-blanket-pardon-on-russia/ …
I've been questioning and posting this too! Disturbing! Is it possible?
Issue first raised by @RepDennyHeck on @CNN Think we should be focused on every worst case scenario #trump is capable of.
Agreed! America deserves better than blanket pardons. The possibility of this angers me.
why did Obama let that Russian lawyer into America when he knew she had ties to the Kremlin
Because she was the defense lawyer for Prevezon. She was in court hours before she met with DonJr.
her visa was denied then doj letter in under Obama!
Nothing you're saying is a defense for DonJr.
I don't follow politics...because you are all idiots. But exactly when did Trump not stand up to Russia?
Thank you. What happens in Vegas Moscow stays in Vegas Moscow.
Why didn't you stand up to Russia prior to Trump being elected and when it was obvious they meddled in the recent election? Why? plz answer?
Warren will have to look for a real job when her term is up
Way to go Pocahontas... Now repeal that loser Obamacare and start over with something that makes sense...
Does it matter what the Senate does if the house just keeps it under wraps? It's the same as being a dead bill.
Am I the only one in this boat? I can't trust a Democrat, I can't trust a Republican, I can't trust the Senate, and I can't trust the house.
Keep reading, there a few real ethical people. Bernie is one of them. He could have been massively rich from payouts like most of them.
Who were the two that voted against this? We need them out. They are not patriots.
Bernie Sanders 
Mike Lee
https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&session=1&vote=00144 …
Why did he vote no on this one? https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&session=1&vote=00147 …
He voted no on the one that was for sanctions on Iran AND Russia and voted yes for sanctions against Russia only
Then CNN got it wrong:

Cult followers of Fat-ass orange shit gibbon with the fake hair shouldn't make fun of anybody's looks...

When you run for PRESIDENT next time you will get all 50 states at 100% Every single vote WILL BE YOURS. #ImpeachTrump
impeach for what? Because you don't like him? It doesn't work like that! 
Thank you Senator. When do you think the house will pass it? @SpeakerRyan
This was an Iran sanctions bill with Russia tacked on. @SenSanders voted no to prevent damage to O's nuclear deal.
You are mistaken. Sanders voted Yay. The Nays were Paul and Lee. 
https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&session=1&vote=00144 …
I believe this is the vote with the Russian sanctions (98-2) and B Sanders was Nay. https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&session=1&vote=00147 …
Hmmm, interesting. The Statement of Purpose in the one I cited says "to impose Sanctions with respect to Russian Federation".
Like Killary did giving away our Uran for CF donations? You're a joke.
Research. Get the facts. If Hillary actually had *that* much individual power, do you think she would have lost? 9 departments signed off.
Just do it.
Unfortunately Trump has a veto pen.  But still, thank you.
Well look at the Chief,  actually doing her job. Goodie for you. #AmazingEvenYourself
"Stand up to Russia". You mean like Obama did? Until after the election anyway. Isn't that what he said? Where was the Senate on that one?
There's a start.  Now, if you could separate from Endless war, Big Oil, Ag, & Pharma & support Single Payer health, I'd vote Dem again.
hot damn!
Where was the @BarackObama  administration during the Russian interference? Have you just woken up...
Yea that is now being watered down by the GOP in the house so
TY! #Russia terrorized my childhood. Always ready for the Nukes in the 80's. I HATE Russia. Keep pushing them out!
Held up by.....wait for it..Paul Ryan
Where is that bill in the House?!
Yes agreed our free world needs to send this message - Russia in Crimea is not acceptable, this is where Russia's communism is problematic
Do not boast yet. See if sanctions get all votes in House & whether they get enforced by this sleazy administration. It's not over.
Stop acting like Trump isn't standing up to Russia! He's implementing a wise old phrase of "keep your friends close and your ENEMIES CLOSER"
Who are the 2? They need new jobs.
With all respect Ms. Warren but can you please run for president in 2020? I would vote and feel at ease knowing you will run things in usa 
Thats right no more Uranium for u russia! Take that!
Love you @SenWarren. Thank you for all that you do. You're an inspiration.
The problem is that it will never pass the House, they are all Trump lackeys and do not have the cojones to go against Der Fuhrer
I wanna know why 2 were against it
The need to shut down this Kleptocracy , is getting stronger and stronger , @GOP can step up or stand aside #TheResistance
He has stood up to more world leaders than your serial apologist, Obama. You are pathetic.
Who were the 2?
And now, .@davereichert , it's your turn. Your constituents in WA-8 expect you to do the right thing & protect US from attacks on democracy
Thank you Senator Warren!!!
some sense prevails!
YAY!!!!!
Makes Better Sense, Makes a Better Vote @DiehlForSenate @newtgingrich @DailyCaller
Spasibo, Lizzy!
Thank you Senator Warren. The true patriots like you stand between us and disaster. We are behind you, please save our country. 
Keep up the good work!
If they didn't you should condemn the compounds as inhabitable.
I want to know why @GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy is holding up the sanctions bill in the House!? Does Putin have pics of his supposed affair?
@GatesKeith @realDonaldTrump
if the truth does not work.  Just make stuff up.  Right?
Update: the wall is going to begin in the spring of 2018 so that 1 was kept too. & the stock market has hit a record high 27 times since Jan
someone vote her out of office
Remind me why we have sanctions against Russia again? Oh yeah, epic sulking over Ukraine by the last administration
But not The House republicans
#corrupt Elizabeth Warren
Glad to see SOME things can get past party politics.
How long will trump family members be black balled in business after this unfolds more?
Of. Course Trump won't Russia is holding all his debit in loans.

I don't think if the Democrats wants to do what they are supposed to do rather than fighting against Republicans & Donald Trump it's silly
Who are the 2?
The Senate is going to stand up against Russia??? You really are delusional.
who were the 2? smh.
When will it pass the House and be instated! 
I guess Putin is in the right place at the right time. Ditto Assad of Syria. Both men get to be America's enemies & both admired at home. 
We need to rid ourselves of the 2 that voted against sanctions
Who are these 2 ?
Bernie Sanders and Rand Paul, as far as I know
Heard the guy from Utah was in these.
Let's see the Senate stand up to Mass Murder. @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @GOP need to keep their greedy incompetent paws off ACA. Fire them.
Paul Ryan and crew seem to hidden that bill somewhere.#VoteThemOut

It is opposite Putin look at the Americans fool themselves.The elected leaders are not elected to saw their energy.Right now nothing is done
And who were the two holdouts?
Stand for America not Trump, good move senate.
#hangdonaldtrump #revokekushnersecurity
He doesn't stand up to Russia. He bends over for Russia.
Big deal Senator. trump can grease skids for Russian interference and the Senate alone is powerless to stop him. Powerless. Weak. Cowardly.


Mrs.Warren u guys got to find a way to remove power from trump very reckless and cannot be trusted hes trying to ruin our country for profit
Don't he still have to sign tho? Please elaborate.
But where' is the House??
Who were there two?
When does sanction take effect?
How lost are you Warren? Sanctions are an act of war. Sad!
House will tell us if it was a stunt or serious
Please don't let it be a stunt. Action needs to be taken, not lip service.
AND WHAT'S ARE THEY GOING TO DO?????
I cannot find a statement by you on @SenSanders vote against Russian sanctions. Can you tweet a link, please? Or state your opinion? TY.
PLEASE KEEP ON FIGHTING FOR TNTE WORKING POOR 
How about taking action against DNC for rigging the primary?
Thank you, however do they have any teeth or are the sanctions more symbolic so as to calm the angry mob?
Senator Warren, please explain the details of your family's Native  American history. My daughter's class is anxious to learn.

.@ericbolling: "Why is it that conservatives are always told to unite behind the liberals like Obama and Clinton, but not vice versa?" 
Thank you, Senator. 
What rationale did two nay votes have?
Very nice, a ray of hope in the dark
And did you force Obama to stand up against them??? They did this hacking under his watch
U must STOP DJT @ all costs because he is evil, greedy slime mobster.
Excellent! Please also STOP the return of their KGB safe houses. The Trump administration is making a mistake striking a deal with them...
And the House?
That's a bad idea
#WTF happen to #paulryan still holding out HOPING he can SCREW everyone's GRANDMA out of #MEDICAID toss 23M from #ACA give #filthyrich #T$$$
But what are those sanctions?
He cannot stand up to someone he has been working hand in hand with for over a year senator.
Why is Ryan holding it up
That's great. But spineless @SpeakerRyan the @GOP & @HouseGOP will kill it!! Implore the House to pass! Get them out of Trump's pocket!
What can you do about the Royal Family working in our WH & Lying on their FS86? #removeKushners
Yet you won't stand up to the Israeli lobby, AIPAC  who interfere in all your elections by "buying " congress.
Please make sure the sanctions are enforced.
Thank you Senator Warren. I'm glad some of you have a backbone to stand up for us, since Trump is Russia's puppet.
are they in effect? cuz if they're not, you didn't get it done
You're still never going to be President. Except maybe of some tribal casino some where.
Foolish comment from a foolish Trumptard. Nothing to take seriously. Someday you'll realize that you've been conned. Dems will save you.
Putin will be releasing more dirt on Trump since he is not getting their compounds back. I cannot wait! 


Paul Ryan nor the White House want to touch anything with bipartisan support.  #idiots
who were the 2 senators?
Wonder what 2 voted against sanctions?
479 days til Midterms.45millions didn't Vote n 2016. Ga &SC loss n 2017.Pls guide the conversation2 Voters voting2chg the Senate.
Thank you, senator!
Kid Rock will be squashing you!! Please don't cheat again!No
Thank you!
Once again try and keep up with the news - DNC and Russia is the real news.
However, the GOP in the House of Representatives is blocking advancement of the Sanctions Bill and the WH is trying to water it down.
Thank you!!!!
Friends & I have discussed that the lack of standing up may reflect the # of those blackmailed in the party who don't want 2 bare the result
But the House hasn't and the WH is stalling it.  That's,where you should focus. The Senate bill is useless w/o House.
How about pass sanctions on the the crap countries that we give money to then wish death on us and our values.  Cut the cash off!!!
Yes, but will the House follow suit?
But comrade Ryan stands in the way
Yippee somebody's doing something! Can't he veto it?
Too bad @BernieSanders was one of two dissenting votes
NO!!! Two dissents on FINAL bill were Paul and Lee. Sanders voted FOR Russian Sanctions.
Thank you 
Pocahontas you just need a drum to beat because you're afraid Trump is winning at everything.
This is a joke in itself. The sanctions worked so well against Iran. Not to mention sanctions on North Korea that already exist. What a joke
"Stand up"? What does that mean genius?
thank you ma'am 
Too bad the gutless House won't do the same. Shameful.
What's being done to counter this?
yes except paul ryan is holding them hostage in the house.  What can the Senators do about it. Shameful not u Ryan
Good job chief make your tribe proud.
Thank you for putting our country and the American people first
Way to go Elizabeth !We need the investigations to get all the criminal filth and treason out that has been committed by Drump et al..karma
Lee and Paul (UT and KS) nay, van Hollen not voting.. But why has House stalled since 6/14. 2:08 PM? .https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&session=1&vote=00144 …
