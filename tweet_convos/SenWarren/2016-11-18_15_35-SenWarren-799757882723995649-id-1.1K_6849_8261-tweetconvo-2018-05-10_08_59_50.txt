Where's your proof beside "because I said so"?  We would all like to see it.
look at any news site? It's not hidden...
Sorry.  There aren't any newsites lol!
yes, yes there are. Educate yourself.
I have. It's all lies and propaganda.
everything that comes out of DJTs mouth is a lie. He's a fraud, proven time and time again.
Everything?  So he lied about bringing companies back to US and Ford said OK and it's a lie?
YES! Ford was never planning on leaving the US, at least not until contract was up in 2019...
.@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Now please get some forensic accountants on the Trump Foundation "charity" case.
Not any.  They're all busy with the Clinton Foundation and pedophile sex ring and child trafficking.
oh I don't think they're looking into Trump's child rape case & his pal's already jailed
There is no child rape case against Trump.
Says the mysoginist who voted for orange Hitler
Just because I called out your lie it doesn't make me a mysoginist.  You're a racist.
you didn't call me out stop getting news from Britbart & join the real world
I didn't have to read any news to know that.  Maybe you should read more.
guilty, start impeachment now.
Can't.  Case is settled with no wrongdoing.
Because you always pay $25 million when you've done nothing wrong.
He has better things to do than drag it out.  $25 mil is like a buck to you and me.
So you would admit to guilt over $1?
This isn't about me so it's none of your business.
Bill Clinton pd  Paula Jones $850k. Why isn't he in jail?
It's a settlement. Didn't say Trump should go to jail but is still guilty.
as apposed to Hitllary and treason? Shut up bitch
"HE SAID HE DID NOTHING WRONG. THEN WHY PAY 25MIL?!" #LIAR #FRAUD #GUILTYAcrossTheBOARD! #AUDITNOW!
I thought citizens were innocent until proven guilty and you call yourself a lawmaker y'r pathetic!
Trying to make money off Benghazi hypocrite?
there is no admittance of fault, hypocrite. Read about it, if you care to actually know what's happening here.
yet the government does it everyday and gets away with it!
are we just giving up on Senate seats now?
Your opinion. Never went to trial. Case not proven. Get over your hate! Fake Indian!
They pd 4 a Real Estate course and didn't do what it takes 2 get the same results. Only handful of people.
Did he actually PAY the judgement? If not, does he have the legal right to take office? Serious question.
/ Good! Now How much will give #Hillary back to #Haiti?  
Africans and those bad #HIV vaccines.?
his biz and family are gonna make more than that as they monetize the Presidency
I wished they would have refused to settle. It would have been great to see him in court.
just because there were some unhappy students doesn't mean he ripped them off, maybe they just got bad grades
You do not know the story if U can say that. Learn your facts. U mislead people just like Hillary. #MAGA
Just wait until all the #corruption comes out of the @realDonaldTrump Presidency.
Started with @IvankaTrump and Japan.
#More2Come
@tahino1 @realDonaldTrump @BostonGlobe What a wonderful president we have.
How many schools did you scam? CLAIMING INDIAN HERITAGE WHEN NOT A DROP OF INDIAN BLOOD!!
what's up Pocahontas you ain't been on the scene in a while
Love you Elizabeth! T conflicts of interest scary!
Shame on you Warren! The hate you spew doesn't become your office nor does it become us women! Do something nice
Hypocrite @SenWarren What about you trying to make money off Benghazi? Check YOUR blogpost on your site 5/9/2014 @realDonaldTrump
The uneducated DEPLORABLES still cannot mention TRUMP without adding Hillary's name in the convo
Trump is simple too crooked, bringing family against anti-nepotism not keeping business separate
.@Hinasil2013 @easynan2 @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump after years of lawsuits & personal/financial pain to the victims!Trump is a depraved ass

So you're saying #Trump was found guilty as part of settlement?
when do you pay for ripping off all legit minorities with false claims?  How many did you rip off?
are you the real Micheal Murdock
I think this should disqualify Trump and Sanders be put in the White House  #DemExit #Jill2016 #NeverHillary
How much will you pay for lying about your heritage to make millions? Nothing.
The funny part is where he admits no wrongdoing and continues to deny liability in the agreement.
that's Way all cases are when you're settled out of court.
I know. I've settled many.  Denying liability while paying $25M is pure legal fiction.
No he paid to get it off the table. He did not break the law and he did not rip off anyone. more hate from you
why isn't he Jailed and fined?
Donald paid the bounty and is free to go.
the laws need to change
I know, we shouldn't just be able to let someone who was "careless with classified information" be able to walk free.
oh please! Go somewhere and read. Do something useful instead of repeating old talking points
please read something
EMAILS! - Trump supporters

Or Trump Tower, Trump DC,  Trump Turnberry, or NJ,  the list goes on and on.  It's called SUCCESS

The point of this is that Trump is a crook and lies bigly
Oh deluded one. No! 
History will reveal a different story
I'm curious Elizabeth, what did #HillaryClinton pay for leaving 4 Americans to DIE?
Oh yea 

Trump University
@realDonaldTrump
The election is over and you folks still can't defend what he does without pointing at her. Weak.
Weak?
You lecture me for giving @SenWarren back a taste of her own medicine?
Would you say this to Warren?
 
@realDonaldTrump
I'd just like to see anyone defend Trump ONCE without evoking Hillary. Do you really think that works? PEOTUS committed FRAUD!
Pretty cheap for a seasoned CON MAN, if you ask me. 

Now wait and see when he gets his paws on America's money.
you just proved everyone's point. His private business, not the US citizens. We the people...
Everyone's point is that Trump is a CON MAN. A swindler. A  dishonest clown now in charge. @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
have you had your head in the sand? You just described most politicians. Dif is Trump wasnt in public office during that.
You keep telling yourself that. You are gonna need the self-assurance when that asshole breaks the country apart. Good bye.
the country was breaking apart before he announced his candidacy. That is reason he won.
heh NYwanker blocked me. Good. He won't see his next failer coming.
Private email server vs con artist ????
He is the next president. Proud not to have voted for him. Saddened for what could have been
too much...coldnes..
She's on the warpath again! Old news, move on!
Clinton Foundation has paid what? talk to those burning the flag\rioting. Dems like more division.
- So in your mind settling a lawsuit means breaking the law???
Was not enough!
And,... Your point? The man's at work getting great again! JOBS!
when will @HillaryClinton pay Haiti the millions her foundation stole?
and chalking it up to not having time to deal with the winning court case he would have had just so much BS spew
Quit your childish heckling&try to find some common ground, Senator.
He's a bully, a fraud and a crook. Hopefully these combined qualities will lead to an early impeachment....
thats more penalty than HRC paid for her crimes. Like how you think the law only applies to Repubs
- I wonder what else he'll buy his way out of... Trump supporters are silent on this... Go figure.
I seriously hope PEDT boots your lying ass out of the country. He's far too kind. If it were me, I would send you to Mars. BTFO
you going to tweet about DAPL or just tweet about Donald Trump 24/7?
LOL Enough With The Comedic Rhetoric Of Crying Wolf? No One Cares Or Is Much Less Listening Out!!!
HEY POCHANTIAS HILLARY TOOK 25 MILLION FROM SAUDI ARABIA, A COUNTRY THAT KILLS GAY PEOPLE!!!!!!!

@lizzzyk66 @realDonaldTrump @Nordstrom - how could you continue to stock Trump brands? #GrabYourWallet #BoycottTrumpBrand
@wilytone @realDonaldTrump @BostonGlobe Thr buried lede being that the fraud was intentionally baked in b4 launch.
No accident.
how is that slander, it's indisputable fact
... it was a scam which is why there was a settlement. Get your head of the sand.
I sadly agree with you that facts have no merit anymore.
@Can_ada @realDonaldTrump @Boston And here's me thinking that the POTUS isn't supposed to be a crook. Who knew eh?
Net profit $150Million....

@cysfilm @realDonaldTrump @BostonGlobe please make sure the kids get full refunds Mr President
Bill Clinton settled rape cases and you supported him going to the WH. I think you need to take a step back!
I believe it was a settlement not a judgement perhaps u learned that in law school?
Let's investigate the Clinton Foundation, wonder what we will find?
It's a sad America when we have someone as incompetent as this at the helm who hates all of us.
National Review: Elizabeth Warren Made Over $240K Flipping Foreclosed Homes



Do you buy this art also?
Watch this carefully. No reason to believe this $25M will be paid quickly. I predict big league foot-dragging by you-know-who.
I believe there was no admsission to guilt, settled to focus on running the country. Spin spin
let'$ $ee if he pay$ the $ettlement money, $hall we?
What! I already RT this? Well, it deserves more attention.
No he settled because he wanted to clear the air before inauguration to escape the constant bullshit from u
@democracyloses @realDonaldTrump @BostonGlobe Please keep talking about this and the  million dollar NY fine. #fraudelect
How many students are getting ripped off by government universities???  Far too many...

She will be irrelevant by the next round of elections...
maybe all the unemployed should sue their universities
a college course or even a full college degree does not guarantee of anything...
he settled to wipe the slate clean. No one ripped anyone off -these ppl are opportunists!
and that's your boss

EW you ripped off Native Amer students stealing their college/job opportunities by claiming to be Indian. PAY IT BACK FRAUD
Do @GOP and @KellyannePolls have  @realDonaldTrump on a leash so his old SOP won't fly now? Time for his victims to sue!
Impeachment won't be long in coming.
Trump ripped off unsuspecting students because he's a caring man of character #NOT #PEOTUS #ConMan

he settled so he can focus on making America great again
@MAHAMOSA @realDonaldTrump @BostonGlobe instead of licking HRCs boots you should have been supporting Sanders!
neutral for most of the primary until it was all but over...Liz' heart in right place
In the End, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends
What is Dem leadership DOING about:

1. Comey/FBI?
2. Russian infiltration/Trump/Wiki?
3.Trump's biz non-transparency?
4. Etc
But don't worry, that's just a small fraction of the damage he actually did!

- Incredible, what's happening America?
look at how much you were paid for teaching one class highway robbery
No law was broken   No charges by the  "attorney general"   Because there was  NO CAUSE @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @BostonGlobe
Justice the American way. Just pay your way out. Pay your fine and be President of the USA.
Hillary Clinton lied to Congress, FBI, destroyed evidence under subpoena, felonies, yet you supported her.

.@senwarren @realdonaldtrump @oceanshaman unbelievable! Is there anything they won't do? I'm sick!
so he paid! He is not masquerading as half native Indian! The only thing you are is half A$$
can u say #CORRUPTION how's that draining the swamp working out for ya?
Very sad
And still spent less than Hillary who ripped off America for Billions.
because he wants to move on to fix the plunder that Osama made you beast
He paid that to get us moving on, he would have fought it tooth and nail and won otherwise.  #Fauxcohontas
Okay, Fauxcahontas.
So 98% approval, wow, business must be booming?  Oh wait it is shuttered...things that make you go "hmm"

I wonder if he used his foundation slush fund. We're about to have the most corrupt govt if he's not impeached.
@Maggyw519 @realDonaldTrump @BostonGlobe Some going bankrupt, some losing their homes and they will be lucky to get $2,000 Fair?!
many people settle does not mean guilt so keep your lying mouth shut Warren
@lachristygreen @realDonaldTrump @BostonGlobe he could care less, he is a self serving misogynistic despicable excuse for a human
- As Trump said, he could kill a person in 5th avenue and his followers would keep following him. Nobody was able to stop him.
lock him up now
and you pretended you were an Indian. Also; Laureate U and Clinton Foundation pay4play. #LyinDems
  A drop in the bucket for the profits he made with the Scam.
This election was fraudulent and we need to get injunction on EC so it can be investigated!
Can we please get Hillary to WH and then take care of all these other things. NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT than this!
#AudittheVote Things are not right here!

ELIZABETH WARREN IS A TOTAL MISTAKE TO BE IN POLITICS.SHE SHOULD CONSIDER RETIRING IN A NICE  FARM
No. The accusation is retracted for $. No guilt is assigned. Just extortion.
It's called accountability. You Dems should look into it...
