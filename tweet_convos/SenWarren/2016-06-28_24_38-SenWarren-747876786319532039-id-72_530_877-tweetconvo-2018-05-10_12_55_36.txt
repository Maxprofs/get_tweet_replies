Which Gun Law would have prevented a Terrorist shooting?
the ones against assault rifles. Lot less fatalities.
Exactly how many gun deaths are from "assault rifles" each year?
49 at the Orlando shooting...(just 1 instance).
ar-15 isn't an assault rifle
He didn't use an AR15...just 2 other semi-automatics.

@TheRework @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP I might be a foreigner..but HouseGOP sounds as bad as Putin.
@SenWarren @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP
Wow - the Democrats would NEVER pass a bill in the dead of night unless it is to raise their own pay.
@SenWarren @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP
Liz, am I clear? Tell your F girlfriend @HillaryClinton pack her bags and withdraw for #Benghazi #emails. Period. #Tatiana
when bumpkin @TGowdySC says she's not guilty, you should hush.
@normangoldman @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP The Republican Party has never done a darn thing for the average American. Ever.
Get off your Zika high horse.
You say it Pocahontas
@riromtz @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP Dang Republicans.
@SenWarren @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP
@SenWarren @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP
what does it feel like to become what you've fought against all of your life? Was the fall sudden or incremental?
If you Democrats weren't sitting around on your a.. maybe you could do something.
how about the "Indian" senator and Democrats do something about illegal immi and radical Islam and enormous debt.
#NoBillNoBreak is without a doubt the most pathetic adolescent attempt at anything ever.  #crybullies
@SenWarren @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP
Damn! They must have slipped in while u all were taking those selfies & eating the catering in the back
@TruthBlooms1 @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP #assholes
@SenWarren @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP
HOUSE democrats LYING CORRUPT CROOKED November America VOTING TRUMP PRESIDENT economy balance budget
House Dems made fools of themselves and YOU brought doughnuts! DISGRACEFUL old fools.
that's what you get for sitting on your...
I wouldn't really call napping and eating, "fighting for". Also, that bill would have solved nothing...
it was a TRAP BILL!!!
thank you for working for us Senator Warren.
It's a terrible bill. It's terrible for Puerto Rico. But if it was for a GOP lead state.....
Cutting birth control funding in Puerto Rico helps women in Puerto Rico? How GOP?
Get off guns. We're NEVER giving up our guns. Guns save lives every day. Its just never talked about.
It's too bad the GOP didn't join your stupid sitin, they should have protested for Kate's Law!
. And this is why.
Maybe you guys should do your job and keep your eye on the ball.
@SenWarren @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP
2009..Democrat president and Democrats in the majority. Nothing was done then.
Quit laying blame. You all just talk, but in reality you all are just freeloaders on the economy.
Just be quiet and go do something other than being a selfserving sellout
Never have so many dem lawmakers worked so hard to restrict law abiding citizens civil rights. Evil socialism at work.
over 100,000 people die every year from FDA approved drugs. Deaths over doubled under Obama.
according to Harry, the worst piece of legislation he's ever seen. #disgraceful
Including provisions to fly confederate flag, limit @PPact funding. @HouseGOP most concerned with discriminating
I watched that undemocratic farce the @HouseGOP pulled in the dead of night. They don't care about #Zika
They do lots of stuff under the covers! Why not a clean bill just for Zika hmmmm?
3am wow
r stuck in pre-operational stage of dev. Egocentric and unwilling to listen to other viewpoints
Maybe if the democrats were actually doing your job instead of protesting you could have stopped it.
Maybe they drinkum fire water.
while you backstabbed everyone who supported you before you endorsed Hillary. #ScrewYou
EW never said she backed one over the other. Relax, it will be a bumpy ride.
