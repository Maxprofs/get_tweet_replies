Those are just some of the dozens of constituents – including servicemembers & seniors – who have gotten money back or other help from @CFPB
Prog playbook: regulate the hell out of an industry, then create a bureaucracy to monitor perverse incentives they created.
Keep at it Senator Elizabeth Warren. You are my hero.
@SenSchumer @RepMickMulvaney @CFPB Predatory banks r the rule not the exception-taking away CFPB is anti-American
this should ALL be done at the state level!
Warren Presses Cabinet Picks To Follow Ethics Skirts Same Guidelines Hiding $1.3 Million
Give it up, it's obvious whole system is corrupt all nominated will pass. Even Dems have no balls
thank you EW.  we are with you.. we will march, call, resist,
@linoki @RepMickMulvaney @CFPB why should we vote more Dems into office when they've rolled over & shown their bellies to trump?
WHY? you ask? because you do not represent American ideals or a goodness of heart at ALL!
Elizabeth if you knew the complaints we the people have about you the list would drown DC!
maybe you should take a look at your comments section. capitulation not a good look
@pannlewis44 @co_rapunzel4 @ForQ2 #IRS #Veterans GOP: The Party that says End of Times are coming, They get elected & prove it
Then why are you voting for all his cabinet noms.?
It is time to wrangle our country back from banksters. #JustUs #StillBernie http://jmcam80.wixsite.com/jmcussenate 
Just go away, feauxcahontas
Maybe you shouldn’t have voted for Ben Carson.
Hopefully @SenWarren runs for President!
Maybe @RepMickMulvaney should take a look at some of the complaints his constituents have filed with the @CFPB: 
That'd be choice. Then there would be 4 more years of @realDonaldTrump
Warren pitiful vote. You owe Supporters explanation N0W. Give appearance of brown noser. Nudging out Ryan

It's like an avalanche! We need a plan
.@SenWarren @RepMickMulvaney @CFPB 
WATCH & RETWEET
GREAT... RETWEET https://twitter.com/TimRunsHisMouth/status/823922489780817920 …
Carson? Are you serious? Remember the year of no vote on Merrick? What gives with the cave in? Damn, Democrats get a backbone!
maybe you should take a look at your own constituents, many of who are disappointed on your vote to confirm Ben Carson
If you have been paying attention to anything going on, then confirming any of Trump's nominees is a huge slap in the face
to your supporters. I'm truly truly disappointed in you Senator.
Maybe YOU should listen to YOUR constituents & not voted for unqualified Carson! You need to fight for us not roll over for GOP!
.@SenWarren We're gonna have a hard time caring what you say about anything until you explain why you're not blocking Carson's confirmation.
Why are Senate Dems voting for Trump-GOP nominees? @cfpb @repmickmulvaney @whitfordbradley
blah blah blah Ben Carson.
Truly beginning to believe that Sen Warren is every bit as off the rail as the one she obsesses over..DT
Someone should look at your hate speech and bigotry Pokey.  You R anti average American.
U just voted to approve Ben Carson he is unqualified
stop whining and confirm already..
interesting. A lot of these banks are bankrolling the DAPL. Ethics problems all over the place.
As a MA constituent, I'd really like you to give a plausible explanation for your vote to confirm Carson
but but how can we believe you we believe you to be a liar races and a fascist
@KaraDemocrat @RepMickMulvaney @CFPB Those are the LAST people he wants to hear from
Have U forgotten who this man Trump is? No Trump, no GOP, no compromise. Reminder:we're taking names.
love hard facts supported by documentation
I & millions other voters find it disgusting 
 this man in office. 4 yr. we all b homeless/dying/disease
if his head wasn't jammed up Donald Trump's ass he'd have an opportunity to look at some of that info
he doesn't care it's all about their agenda
Quite a list.
Ben Carson, seriously?  You lose points on that one.
Knox the facts - feel the pain. Of course bankisters don't like the Commission - what criminal loved cops?
List of what insurers can choose nt 2 cover in #TrumpCare passed #MNLeg (R) @stevedraz cancer, diabetes..
Facts don't seem to matter - you must go "Tea Party" at every turn - take no quarter, none.
ummm those are almost 3 years old???
Maybe you should look at your constituents in state where every county went blue and explain why you confirmed Ben Carson.
@SenSchumer @RepMickMulvaney @CFPB CFPB is a good START. Financial industry as admitted they can't regulate themselves.
Why did you approve Ben Carson?
He probably has. He doesn't care.
GOP = Greedy One Percent @RepMickMulvaney

Wow! Look at all these SC complaints! Does SC even care this consumer help may be taken away???
@SenSchumer @RepMickMulvaney @CFPB You votes yes on Carson??? I'm from Baltimore. There is something wrong with him. Smh.
@SenSchumer @RepMickMulvaney @CFPB can we see yours too. Js

  @SenWarren @Michael_S_Barr @RepMickMulvaney @CFPB
.@SenWarren @RepMickMulvaney @CFPB He doesn't care about oridnary constituents. CFPB affects of his donors' profits. https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cid=N00031412 …

@cnnbrk How about IBM/Seterus received Tarp Funds are they exempt Senator's. https://www.bbb.org/oregon/business-reviews/mortgage-bankers/seterus-inc-in-beaverton-or-22542531/Alerts-and-Actions …
I am gonna hope you was talkin to @RepMickMulvaney. 
Oh please @SenWarren!! People stopped listening to you once they found out you weren't a real #Pocahontas!  @RepMickMulvaney @CFPB
 "should"  'mandate'

how could anyone be against consumer financial protection?  ONLY someone in the pocket of the industry.
have you done anything as a senator Beth?  seems to me you're all hot air. serve the people would you.
No they will ignore! Look @SpeakerRyan turned off his phones! This is a huge Grift! DT/Bannon don't care
-from  2014???
To bad; there is a whole new attitude. What makes BIG MONEY is ok with trump even if immoral.
; Right see what good it does for the people that can't afford 2 have an attorney on the payroll unlike 45 & all his cabinet picks
maybe yours should remember your vote for Carson for HUD. Shame on you!
Never in a million years thought this would happen. Wow! So sad.
He represents money, not people.
well...money & Satan
Well citi bank suggesting I could pay my bill by selling my hair when it feel out from chemo. So mean
HELP!!  We are witnessing a dictator installing his oligarchy govt in USA.  SOMEONE in power should stop this before a coup..
That's nice, but BEN CARSON?
It's nice that our senators took from Saturday's march a desire to give Trump a rubber stamp of approval.
I fully expect the Marco Rubios of the senate to lack backbone. But, COME ON, no on all these clowns. #resist
#spinless E. Warren = Team Trump
Dear Senator Warren, How soon will The Don Man and his administration be impeached? #ResistTrump
power to the people
Maybe you should look at some filed by your home state people that want you out of office!  
I have a sneaking suspicion that anything you tweet right now is going to get lost in a chorus of "Ben Carson?!" responses. 
maybe you should worry about representing Mass and let his constituents worry about him?  Sound fair!
Maybe you can take a stand against Trump and oppose all his nominees instead of lip service. I marched. Do your fucking job.
THANK YOU! HAVE MY TOTAL SUPPORT! I BELIEVE TRUMP TAXES WILL B  ISSUE THAT TAKES TRUMP DOWN! PLEASE HELP!
and 3million votes illegal??? Are we really puttin up with this??
Rep Mulvaney hates consumers.  Rep Mulvaney, why do you hate your people including vets and the elderly?
Well said! @RepMickMulvaney  could also read this about @CFPB
How do you keep your chin up when these horrible news days just keep coming? I need some pointers!
please explain why you voted to confim Carson? You're someone I respect very much and I'd really like to know why, please.
Legal bribery. Our gov is bought and sold.
