Donald said he was going to use bossiness men because politicians cannot be trusted  they are bought
police are corrupt every field has good and bad. Obama collected sewage to fill his cabinets
do you acknowledge that a global Econ hurts the US?
and people who don't even live in this country.
illegal immigration hurts our economy. I have no problem with people coming here legally.
@Maggyw519 @realDonaldTrump Technically, the sterility of Trump's insertion into the system begs question of Justice Sen. Warren
Both parties allowed for it. By internet bliss, a sterile solution to actually voting
Fixed? No, ignored votes because computers were trusted
Comey letter was an eruption of internal nature unavoidable in that we live in a virtual continuum now. Undeniable

lol what are you gonna do? Go back to your safe space.
name 1 lobbyist.
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump Because he owes Goldman Sachs so much money he's trying to kill 2 birds with one stone.
Did we really expect anything else?
@SarahKSilverman @realDonaldTrump Should we be surprised? The man doesn't give a shit abt the little ppl! It'll only get worse
Thank God he didn't hire you, @SenWarren .  That would have been truly deplorable.
And so much for unity as stated election night when Bannon is selected as senior White House staff.
How can someone with as corrupt a moral compass as Don the Con be expected to keep a promise?
The words promise and Trump do not belong together
& racists. You forgot racists.
@NikkiIalreadyno @realDonaldTrump Can the United States act now on the Gambian dictator president jammeh just cut international
Amen! And thank you for being relentless @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
Bernie and Liz....sellouts....#howsthenewlakehouse   #fliphousesmuch

#WednesdayWisdom Hillary Clinton is corrupt-to-the-core. #WakeUp #DemExit
.@DimitriNosarev the cost for drugs for will cost hundreds of thousands with the plans Trump has for us. #bigpharma
That's called Moore's Law. It has about as much to do with Trump as Al Gore does the Internet.
@SarahKSilverman Not to mention bigots.
@sensanders Fauxchoantas dems receive money and orders from their Nazi money man George Soros
Those folks with economic anxiety have to be feeling REALLY distressed right now.
#Liz2020
Thank you, Senator! Thank you for your your unrelenting barrage against him. #resist
Unfortunately, his voters don't give a shit: they still expect to get their preferential access to his scraps.
@SenSanders @realDonaldTrump wait what? Politician breaking a promise? NO freaking way
you watch and see in next few hours the protection of our nations leaders beyond our technology but
And it is shameful that Americans refused to know who was that guy! @SenWarren
@SenSanders @realDonaldTrump 

Transition aint Cabinet...
Hmmm, the very people that propped clinton up-think again.
You supported Hilary who said that  a wall st  denizen would do the best regulating the st. You broke it first.
To say nothing of selecting a white nationalist anti-Semite as a top adviser.
Trump's son in law is Jewish
.@DeplorableTLB @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump I cannot explain why the Trump family is comfortable with white nationalism and the KKK.
Proof? You do realize Hillary's campaign did a lot to smear him and the DNC screwed Sanders over.
I'm not going to debate with you. Bannon is an open white nationalist. Sorry you like him.
I said I like Bannon? No, how typical.
If you're not outraged by the situation, we simply have no common ground.
Nope, I'm enraged about the last few years & everything about The Clintons.
@BethR_27516 @realDonaldTrump And swamp creatures 
Exactly! He said he'd drain the swamp, but never said what he'd replace it with... more swamp creatures!! Duh!
@BethR_27516 @realDonaldTrump they will listen in the end like they did after Bush.
Hope so... but they're pretty incapable of seeing what's happening right in front if them.
he's a fake @realDonaldTrump
@SenSanders @realDonaldTrump And hes still adding more. America got it wrong. Hes doing what he campaignd against. N.M.P...
Sadly those who will be hurt the most are those that voted overwhelmingly for him. What a world we have wrought.
#reaping&sowing
Come on, Sen. Warren, you can't be surprised by this, can you? Just the beginning of the sleaze.
The one (tiny) silver lining in this mighy be watching Trump supporters while he breaks every one of his promises
And he will. He will hang all of them out to dry, his wealthy buds excepted.
TRUMP IS A CANCER. HE AND HIS NAZI BUDDIES WILL DESTROY DEMOCRACY.  A LIAR WHO KNOWS NO EQUAL.  9/11 = 11/9.
I wish we have people like Warren and Sanders @SenWarren and senator Sanders @SenSanders
and don't forget Nazis
more like hiring the swamp
Please help us find a way to reach those who were fooled by him w/this message.
that would be an exercise in futility. They will follow this dumpster fire to their bitter end.
Ms Warren you're irrelevant and pathetic. Accept the reality that you're disconnected from working US citizens !
He's your BOSS now Pocahontas! You're the unofficial latrine cleaner of Washington now! Get scrubbin
I do believe you lost now get over it
@MeatballMom2 Elizabeth, you have no idea what's going on in society. Trump is right, you are goofy.
true!!!!
looks like it autocorrected when you tried to type "white supremacists".
And worse. @SenWarren @hammpo @realDonaldTrump
The fake Indian has spoken. 
God help us
@DonnaDee479 @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @TheLastWord @maddow @CNN
I'm watching! Go get him @SenWarren! We are behind you!
Lol
And of course Putin puppets & other Fascists!
what a baby Dove is. LOL
@TSal58 @realDonaldTrump also began coruption by advertising family jewelry on government website. Profiteering for family.
don't you see Elizabeth, he has to fill the swamp in order that he might drain it
....that's serious delusion...wow.
btw it's 'empower' not 'impower' women
Thank you for the unnecessary spelling lesson. It has to do with a trademarked coaching model we created.
made up words for a made up pseudo science - snake oil
says the person hidden behind the biggest snake oil salesman in US history.
we may be at cross purposes here - do you think I am a Trump supporter?
@johnalogue @realDonaldTrump odd, I don't feel he has
just goes to show the uneducated favored trump
UNEDUCATED ?   Oh, like LeBron, Beyonce, Pharrell, JayZ, Katy Perry, etc.  #Losers
Oh, you're from Alabama.
you nailed me there....boy, how'd,you figure that out....by reading my bio?
I just guessed based on your wit to anger ratio and the slope of your brow.
guess that'll work since reading gives you difficulties since your brother is your father
you're cute when you're angry.

Exit polls were correct, Hillary Clinton won — #Crosscheck & the other 9 methods to steal votes flipped the election http://www.thelondoneconomic.com/uncategorised/donald-trump-was-right-the-election-was-rigged-in-his-favour/15/11/ … 
@SenSanders @realDonaldTrump Bernie retweeted this to liz. Tweedle dee. Tweedle dum.
trump s word has no value.
. hypocrite, you were very quiet when Hillary was receiving millions from Wall Street.
then we need you more than ever and the other democrats need to stand up to this!

again that is totally false and has bee debunked by Harvard you brain dead moron
She checked the boxes at other schools too.
there were no boxes your making shit up like your boy who lied about everything  he said build a wall  ROFLMAO
@SenSanders  if you can't help then at least Do no harm. These kind of postings are not helpful. Ego constipation.
You backed Clinton @SenWarren, can't take you seriously anymore.
@SarahKSilverman @realDonaldTrump
didn't expect anything different from someone who likens himself one of those elite. #talkischeap
let's keep a list of broken promises shall we
filled? Elizabeth? Can you count?
hey Pocahontas, you already proved yourself a LIAR! What you say to us now falls right off!!
@SarahKSilverman @realDonaldTrump you aligned yourself with a criminal. And lost. Sour grapes.
@chelseaperetti @realDonaldTrump I hope his supporters feel properly duped.
yougotnothing
Go Senator Warren!  I'm a big fan!
what was his promise for his transition team? hire street thugs? i don't think he promised anything
just like Obama
either would have been a bad choice  i just voted  for vice  cause in the end the vice is going to rule
He didn't take money from them; but U did.  Dodd-Frank gives big banks advantages over smaller banks.  U own it.
Ironic @SenWarren. You happily joined team @Citibank for "Her Turn". Your credibility is shot.
how would HRC's have been ANY different?
the last time I checked, Senator Warren's candidate lost - nobody cares what she says
While u destroyed ur raison d'etre? Hope shedding ALL credibility to bump & grind with a filthy lying felon was worth it.
He IS a POLITICIAN!!!!
What did U expect? UR watching overthrow of govt in real time .. not sure what tweeting is going to do
@DebraMessing @realDonaldTrump BTW. We still don't care about u or HRC opinions
@DebraMessing @realDonaldTrump he lied to everyone be ready Trump will take over like Putin and destroy America with his puppets
NETFLIX $60B LOOT PONZI SCHEME BY MARY JO WHITE GANG@SEC
Sen Warren, this man has one priority - himself. Americans are just in his way. #ImpeachTrump
@meanwhilefl @realDonaldTrump Please support Dyslexic student Senator Warren. End the school to prison pipeline.
First you complain he's not one of you- now you complain they are.  TRUMP won get over it.
Sanders Warren/ Warren Sanders2020. But I have a feeling 2016 was the last election in USA. We just elected King

you endorsed Hilliary
He's keeping his word by clearly stating that he would have the Best from Wall St. working on trade and finance
Rules only apply to Democrats. Political Correctness, and Respect don't apply to Trump or the GOP!
DONT FORGET THE WHITE NATIONALIST!!!!
@mch7576 What's sad is his followers don't care
shocked, shocked.
Gee, sounds like a Dem !!
when your supporters use FB as a resource they won't ever know
tell the People how you and others met with Soros for 3 day conference to undermine Trump.   You're a disgrace
He should have picked u n Bernie Than he could cover the stupid contingent
wonder when his voters will figure this out.....he is out for his own agenda.....
@Dcd_cynthia @realDonaldTrump wait what ? But he tells it like it is ! What happened???
Do you really think all of us need your advocacy?  You're one of the reasons I support @realDonaldTrump.  You are disappointing.
Temper Tantrums dont work with this administration. Find your safe space, pat a puppy, wear your safety pin& FO.
He didn't take their money fauxahontess -but you sure did.
and now he is looking at two chicken hawks for secretary of state. both doctor shopping during Vietnam war
AND THIS IS WHY WE WANT TRUMP, #DRAINTHESWAMP OF people like you and Reid!
go Liz go
@60bourbon @realDonaldTrump didn't you hear in his 60 minute interview? That's all there is...makes me sick
he's an idiot
A blatant lie from fauxcahontas Soros puppet. Stick a sock in it already

#MAGA
Yeah totally! You should instead fill your team with the lobbyists that give to Warren.
I am sure he will break some more promises. He called HRC crooked.  Hello pot, met kettle!
Just like Barry did. Funny, I don't remember you crying about that. Time to pretend to be the conscientious watchdog  now? Sad.
@SarahKSilverman he claimed on 60 mins. "Thats all he had to choose from. Lobbyists are everywhere!"
@breezee98 @realDonaldTrump And You Lost!!! Nice Try!
@SarahKSilverman @realDonaldTrump keeping promises will hurt his bottom line. He don't know what he speaks.
You're dumber than I thought #fauxcahontis. #Transition needs experience. #swampdraining will happen. @mcuban
and had a lobbyist representing a foreign government ( Turkey) attend your first full daily security briefing
Trump linked to Kremlin who hacked DNC to sway election. FBI Interference.Voter suppression. 2m+ fewer votes.Where's the outrage?
no disappointment in here with his supporters, only bitterness from the left.
@MsSarahPaulson @realDonaldTrump Oh&his son in law that's scary,Father was convicted on tax evasion by none other @ChrisChristie
who are you to talk? WE TRUSTED YOU!!! We have you to thank for @realDonaldTrump
No surprise. His "GOBs" (Good Ol' Boys) Club.
@AndyRichter @realDonaldTrump YAAAWN...
hey, fauxahountus, you are part of the problem with D.C.
And the KKK.
otherwise, you'd complain how unqualified they are.
Just in time for your 2020 campaign everyone in America hopes?
@SenSanders @realDonaldTrump which is what the demonCrats   Would do - so chill out!
?
gonna be a long 4 years of you complaining.  Can't we at least wait until he's in office?  Geez.
I'm sorry but you have lost any respect for me to even entertain any notion or word out of your mouth! #DrainTheSwamp
@Sashworks_com @realDonaldTrump Beautiful amazing role-models or dank swamp of true death.
AND YOU BETRAYED MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHEN YOU ENDORSED THE MOST CORRUPT CANDIDATE IN HISTORY!
When u brag all the kool kids will be @ ur party but u dont know any so its just ur friends only more awkward @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
Trump's transition team should fight against         populism, nationalism and fascism
because transition works so well when you bring in a bunch of outsiders.   Lol
@_nuotio_ @realDonaldTrump And racists
nice
look @ these trump supporters comments. It's like they don't care that far more of us voted for Hillary over him
Next you'll claim Hillary wouldn't have been hiring insiders. 
Alert - she would've been 10x worse
@HughAcheson @realDonaldTrump With all due respect, the country is aching for a more positive outlook for the future.#INSPIRATION
I wonder if @SenWarren is considering running for President in 2020?
@hotcoffeeandpie hey stupid these people worked with him on the campaign he meant drain the swamp meaning YOU!Glad you're leavjng
And you Senator Warren are one of the sane ones left in Washington. We're counting on you.
you forgot ALT RIGHT
the DNC is anti-Semetic....what is your point?
@MaureenShaw @realDonaldTrump Election audit anyone?
and you endorsed @HillaryClinton instead of @BernieSanders. You are no better than him
#DoNotWorkWithHim
What? No rust belt types?
you're owned by George Soros you nut job @realDonaldTrump
doesn't Senate confirmation of Trump appointees require FBI background check & tax returns? #justasking
@SenSanders @realDonaldTrump the sheeple fell for it as expected #fillingtheswamp
lol this kids face kills me
His "promises" are just nothing but more of his lies!
your just upset because you won't get the job promised to you by hilly!!!! Face reality- you lost.
.Christie was lucky getting 'fired'.I think 'The Professor' got it right saying that Trump may be impeached sooner not later!
Yes, cleaning the Swamp he is not!  Poor fools that put him in office!
The world loves you Senator Warren. Don't give up. From New Zealand.
@LeaBlackMiami @realDonaldTrump ms.warren.keep dividing our country with your useless rhetoric U should work on CNN.u fit in w/bs
Lock Trump Up
What do you expect from a bag of Hot air
how would you know? He hasn't announced them yet lol. Cut your hateful negativity and just wait. Jeesh
@Teamsters @realDonaldTrump You broke your promise to protect consumers.
of course he broke his promise already.  All who voted for him will still stand up for him.  He'll ruin us.
Rhetoric doesn't count for anything...
okay pocahontas.
@Diane_Sheehan @realDonaldTrump isn't that exactly how you got elected senator?
and family.
not surprising trumpers believe every word he says, lies become truth   Fact becomes fiction its called #subliminalpolitics
@SenSanders @realDonaldTrump @Pat_n_STL
He knows no one else!
If @realDonaldTrump is really trying to #draintheswamp why does his cabinet look like the Everglades?
And whit supremacists!!
