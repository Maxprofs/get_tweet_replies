No isn't this just a budget measure. Republicans can't pass real legislation so they use procedural tricks.
Yeah, and Obumass Care had how many insurance cos. pull out??
Because the Reps sabotaged making ins co nervous with the uncertainty.
Rem. N Pel. ? "We have to pass it b4 we can see it"? WTF dbl standard.
Senator take your seat.
Time for the Dems to realize the GOP is HAPPY about taking care away from 22 mil. If any vote no, it's b/c 22 mil isn't good ENOUGH for them
Stop misleading the public. Most who will lose coverage are those who will not BUY it once the law no longer requires them to.
#GOP only cars about their rich donors. They have been conning Americans for decades. STAND UP FIGHT BACK! Time to get dirty and fight!
What energy,  get a real job.
Bot
Butt
60% of Americans were against obummer care! That didn't matter because the democraps are soooo much smarter than us deplorables!!!!
It's not health care, it's deathscare
It's a "death care" bill.
Oh, sad it's not another hand our.

"I mean, it's MOSTLY BULLSH*T right now"- @CNN producer on Russia story. They KNOW it's #FakeNews! #AmericanPravda

So 1 out of 365 African Americans are born with Sickle Cell ! So 1 out of 365 would die ! Unless rich
Truman tried socialized medicine n the 50's but defeated by AMA & lobbyists. Worst mistake ever.
Obamacare hurt millions of people and needs repealed
How many of you people actually read the bill and understand it? Cause all your points are the same ones the MSM are making.
Healthcare is available to all, ins. is not, please tell the truth
It's not!  Its a tax cut bill that masquerades as a health care bill.  Why do the rich need the sweat and tears of the country's poorest?
Perfect solution: Force these same republicans to use this healthcare insurance themselves...fastest way to get best plan!
@AmerMedicalAssn supporting a liberal cause isn't exactly a surprise.
So sad! So heartless!
What harms people is a $5k penalty for not buying insurance. Thank you President Trump for canceling the democrat's oppressive tax
This is "health insurance", not health care.  Until profits are taken out of health, it will never be health care
Yes, lets all go vote for Rs since they love their fellow human beings so much r should I say ppl making over  $250k #GOP #greed #trump spin
It's opposed by AMA because it cuts into their ridiculous profits. Get out of bed with big health, senator.
it is more an "unhealthy" ... kind of proposal 
a very foolish one !!
(regards from El Salvador mademoiselle Warren)
Maybe we should back off health care and let Obama implode. Would that please you.
sounds more like a "health don't care" bill!
And you are not native American what's your point !
R there Republicans who r MDs? 
If so,  forgot Hypocratic Oath:
"FIRST DO NO HARM"
Thank you for toning down your rhetoric.
No more scare tactics.  Please!
for the general public it's a HealthScare bill. For the benefiting rich people it is a #Wealthcare bill.
screw the AMA...part of the problem
And the AMA ain't no liberal bunch o' Doc's.  Gotta be auwfully mean for them to denounce it.
You hurt the na by stealing from them! Pay them back fraud! #impeachwarren
If that is the case why do you support obamacare? no 'health care' bill in history put health care more out of reach for more people
It's all libtard bullshit
It's a tax cut for the wealthy, funded by reducing health care benefits for those who aren't wealthy.
What's even more amazing is that the AMA is overwhelmingly old, white, rich men. Must be killing their profits, not just people!
Neither is your plan. Very harmful for hard working Americans. Of course you don't anything about hard work. Making videos is not hard.
It is a death sentance for 22 million Americans
Another lie from a woman who does not know the meaning of truth.  Remember,what she said to get her college paid for
but that binds me to believe that if you feel 'fire' at all, this is the fire you feel. LOL @TriciaHolcomb11 #truth
Of course not. It is a health insurance bill. Like in Health Insurance Company! #ACHA
If I couldn't charge $18 for an aspirin anymore,  I'd be upset too. Shame on you for being an #Alarmist
It's Unhealth Care they're offering.MAGA alright! Keep drinking the Kool Aid America!
Fauxcahontas speaks with forked tongue.
Republicans are making healthcare the next big bursting bubble with death..misery and all sorts of crazy villian shit.
No but the one passed in the middle of the night by pelosi and community organizer didn't harm millions?  Come on get real
It's a "wealth care" bill, as in they care about theirs.
...and we foot the "bill."
Senator Warren, I know you were opposed to running in last election, but please reconsider becoming our POTUS. We NEED you. 
Money out of their pockets
It's #Wealthcare
How could you be fighting to keep Obamacare.  It has caused premiums to sky rocket and made insurance unaffordable.
Carolyn, with all respect, some people will not be able to buy it because it will be too costly. Then what happens when they get sick?
It's the American Wallstreet Care Act
Call it what it really is ... #Wealthcare.
And you're not a Senator.
Dear fellow Americans Coward Trump will kill millions of Americans as CBO report shows. Do you know Coward Modi is aka as Butcher of Gujrat

Shaming GOP extremists won't work. Will yr party ever actually act to stop them b4 they AHCA & get this: http://amp.slate.com/articles/life/ …
Does this group have lobbyist?
Interesting that most doctors opposed Obamacare...regardless OC has failed & ppl have already lost their insurance. You did nothing to help.
They need to put the heart back in Health Care, leave profits out!
The AMA is a root cause for much if our service  admin costs that are double what they could be.
It's odd that some of  the same people who say they care so much about fetuses care so little about the lives of  breathing human beings.
Please leave America!!!
THIS IS JUST A TAX BREAK FOR THE TOP 1 %    ALMOST A TRILLION DOLLARS ;NOT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION ;THE PAIN AND SUFFERING OF THE MILLIONS
Obamacare was the largest scam you and your party placed on Americans costing working families billions in high premiums, deductibles and dr
Shut up Pocahontas Obamacare was the largest tax increase in history. It's going to save me a bunch of money and I make less than 125K #MAGA
Dear sweet Lord in heaven, why don't they just repeal ACA and "live with" the consequences.  The GOP "replacement" is ludicrous.

But they will get it through because McConnell has money in the bugdet to bribe the other 6, so we are screwed
and the #ACA wasn't what you all promised either
Hmmmm...lets think about that a minute ole clueless one. They benefit the most from OBAMYCARE!!!!
neither bill is a health care bill. Having insurance doesn't mean you can afford the care.The AMA only represents a small percentage of drs
Yes the only thing this cruel bill will harm us in our pockets, and all the people that depend on health insurance will be left out vote no
It's not a 'healthcare' bill at all - it's a vehicle for those massive tax breaks that the wealthiest have been longing for.
It's death for the middle class and a new yacht for the billionaire class.
Your an idoit if you believe that
Wealth Care
I heard it would kill people.
Trump supporters will just say the AMA is part of the swamp, like everyone who is not a thoughtless Trump minion.
Wrong - I didn't blindly follow Obama, nor did a lot of my friends. The ACA was just a start; fix it, don't kill people with the AHCA.
Oh, so you actually read this one, Don't give me the rhetoric, how does it compare to what you gave us? Obamacare subsidized industry
And your plan is any better? The
No, this is a "protect-our-relationships-with-big-money-donors" bill.
Since Mitch and his minions only listened to CEOs. Kill 'em w/facts. Somebody had a great idea about using Claire McCaskill as a commercial.
I'd like to see some Senators interview Doctors and then go to CEO's of Insurance Co's and interview them. Bring the ppl who matter to floor
I sat in the Hospital all day, husband only has a weak heart, no blockage thank god but do you know how many ppl use medicaid/care? A lot.
Nope, it never was
Always was a tax break for the rich!
It's not about healthcare. It's about lining the pockets of the rich. And taking a shot at Obama
You are literally a LIAR.
I hope they let it alone till it croaks. It was 11,000 pgs. You needed a whole dept just to interpret it. Ridiculous in the extreme
One of the only ways to get costs down is to create competition. I can buy auto ins on line anywhere. We need to be able to shop our ins
Politicians created this mess,
Politicians Exempted themselves from this mess, Politicians will make this mess worse !
 @SenSchumer
AMA is just another lobby group pouring dollars into politicians' pockets.
#deathbill
It's an insurance bill. How about if HC providers were more transparent & lowered costs? How much is an aspirin when you're in the hospital?
AND @acpinternist @aafp @APA @AmerAcadPeds @AmerMedicalAssn @Drsforamerica @AmericanCancer @AmDiabetesAssn @ANANursingWorld
AMA makes money off charting/coding. They don't care about patients, nor physicians.
Like you say tax cut for rich where a transfer of billions of dollars goes to wealthy is not a healthcare bill
Lizzy, you must be referring to obumercare which was not a health bill! Obumcare was a high TAX Bill! It cost poor middle class millions!
It's a death penalty care bill
Well Lizzie how about you step up to the plate and contribute?? Is that asking too much?? Do your job!!!
However Obamacare is hurting millions more people than 22...so it's a score actually
Have no worries senator!  This is only the first phase!!

#BCHA #AHCA

This bill is like the anxiety and stress version of typhoid Mary.
Truth ArrowSo killing babies isn't? - Hypocrite - Politician -
And tell me ...what exactly does the AMA do for me? And who is it run and funded by?  Yeah thanks
It's a sick bill.
What can we do to stop this bill other than sending e mails  and making calls?
#TrumpCare is Not a Health Care bill it's an Insurance bill (we pay) for the wealthy #CBOScore #Resist #AHCA @SenateDems
"WePay for the wealthy" sounds like a socialist rant It's the employed citizens who care for the poor and pay their healthcare housing phone
How many people have you harmed with Obamacare?  Do you know? I am one of many.
Exactly
Looks like the Dems are loosing control if every thing. 9-0 SCOTUS. Keep fighting your way down the toilet Pocahontas. Good job
Only reason A.M.A opposes it is it bite into their profits! Doctor's and hospital's have been over charging for decades!
Now if u thnk logically about it and stop leaving things out, ur wrong.  26 million by 2026 is what they say, but reduce deficit by BILLIONS
Dems need new leadership...pretty sure you're not on the short list
.Either is socialism @SenWarren
Please, Senator. It would be a devastating crime to the nation to not call this out, and not to call out the corruption that is behind it.
What corruption?
How about MD's that refuse to take Medicare pt's What's the AMA's position on this practice .
Not healthcare it's Trumpcare! Trump taking care of the rich & himself
I hope it passes!
wealth care
Shut up Pocahontas. Nobody cares what u say.
Of course it isn't. It's always been "Wealth-care bill": tax cuts for top few % of the rich at expense of the poor, i.e. entire GOP strategy
Also can't forget bill gets rid of tanning salon taxes that caused Orange in Chief to switch to spray tan & likely motivated run for POTUS..
Dear Elizabeth Warren , question - so I get to say " the U.S. Congress is not of , by , for the people because bought and paid " , right ?
Wow such harsh words
Exactly. The #MeanerTrumpcare bill is a #GOPDeathPanel bill.
I don't care about them. They are Lobbyists. #Tatiana
So, the question the dems should ask repub voters is:  "Can you really afford Trump?
Yes
How about government gets out of healthcare????
Yeah, my sentiments exactly. I don't want Govt in my Docs office
The docs I've talked to don't want em in their office either
No, most assuredly not!
My Doctor said at the onset of Obamacare that it would diminish overall quality of health care, and he was right
Absolutely. Not only that, the amount of doctors is decreasing because they're not getting paid as much anymore. Can't repay debt
That's true. It's why you see a Physicians asst. when u visit instead of a Doc.
