When are you going to go after Trump again?? We need you!
she is the number 1 person that gets under Trumps skin...hope she gets on the campaign trail soon
@peaceisactive @HouseGOP
uh, how many attacks have we heard about where the attackers shouted God Bless America?
How can that be hard to believe? Even in the wake of Wells-Fargo. Republicans have sold us out for all that big money.
@topmom100 @HouseGOP Don't forget @GOP House email investigation. More wasted $$$
Vacation or 1%legislation GOPspeak4 trick or treat.
@okie210 @HouseGOP they are trying to help your buddy Hillary everyone knows Wall Street owns her
Umm. These bills are written by GOP not Dems
right, establishment GOP hacks want Clinton to win
if so, it's because they are fearful of what an ADD erratic inexperienced narcissist would do.
.@SenWarren Yet Trump's leading because Hillary was chosen by you corporate Dems - Bring Bernie Back! @HouseGOP #HappyBirthdayBernie
Just stop. Bernie's a unifier, you're a divider. @SenWarren @HouseGOP
Sorry, but hating the 1% is NOT unifying
Oh, but it is unifying those with conscience @vidalexperience @SenWarren @HouseGOP
i hear that dems added planned parenthood funding to the bill. Why not let the bill stand alone
Let's no earn your pay! We would be fired for not working for 8 years, not finding Solutions for Constituents your BOSS
oh; joy. :(
& punish PP by taking away $'s, punish house Dems 4 standing up 2 NRA. GOP wants to break US-they suck
#ISTANDWITHTHENRA #DEFUNDPP
What do you think?
People aren't seeing what their "representatives" are actually doing, passing into law. Don't know how to change that.
YOUR GOP AT YOUR SERVICE.....NOT....THEIRS....YES!!!......FOR THEIR MONEY ...TO HIDE & PROTECT
VOTE THEM OUT
Typical. @techweenie When @HouseGOP isn't attacking ACA or worrying re bathrooms, it's trying to make rich richer at our expense.
how about everyone in congress quit muddying the waters. Let a bill be one thing then quit lying about why itdidnt pass
unbelievable
love it when Govt is working 4 us all- Hope we have enough that care abt their country this election
Typical dysfunctional Republicans sniffing for lobbyist money.
don't forget u have to keep increasing the national debt so u can destroy America to a 3rd world country
They Have To All Go#THUGLICONS
Let's talk about those ransom payments by Hussein Obama in form of cash, lying to Americans not being able to wire...
and investigate/subpoena every1 not in their party. waste tax money on rehashed topics.
it's nice to hear from Senator Warren it's been awhile
Pathetic.
Where was concern for public health during ebola outbreak, dear leader's refusal to ban travel to/from affected region?
and where was your dear leader while LA was flooding? ON MARTHA'S VINEYARD, PLAYING GOLF
Hillary can't wait to help them in this matter.
Typical.
@rulajebreal @HouseGOP You've got to be kidding. Well it will reflect in November
@m_millsey How have them rules been working?  Seems no one in DC is willing to enforce them: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/business/dealbook/prosecution-of-financial-crisis-fraud-ends-with-a-whimper.html?_r=0 …
And you responded how? Besides this tweet.
Well,don't worry,just wait until HRC is elected and you'll be happily working to pass them for her.
Same old special interest policies. GOP answers only to big money Wall Street interests. #ASIB
it's a ridiculous  pissing contest
That's the Republicans we have come to know and hate.
@young_marjorie @HouseGOP Stop them! We the people will vote Democrat to rid US of GOP ignorant obstruction & witch hunts. 
SAME OLD TAKE FROM THE POOR GIVE TO THE RICH theme AS ALWAYS STUPID gop
What a joke. My tax $ not at work.  It seams their are very few that do the work FOR THE PEOPLE.
PEOPLE, Please get out and vote. Straight DEM on the ticket
well, its what hillary would want...
and then theres Syria
#bigdonorsb4country
Posted on Trumps TL last night. Deleted 20 minutes later.
26,000 unreported sexual assults in the military-only 238 convictions. What did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?
What we need is for it to rain for 40 days & nights. This world needs a good flushing!
That's coz they only have to work 17 days between now & Election Day-They don't want to get too sweaty! #NeverTrumpence
none of you people do anything of importance I notice all of a sudden you want to make a difference. Loks like a resume
well they gotta pay their " bills"
Boo, GOP!
#BankrupTrump would want the @HouseGOP  renaming federal buildings after him first...  PAR FOR THE COURSE!
& their fake email scandal/ try to put Hillary down.They're all insecure bullies-want to hide their scandals

Zika is attached to approp. bill for US mil. Blocked by dems, tho some crossed aisle to support.
Well don't agree to any of this garbage.  Do what you can to block it. I support none of that.
PLEASE work FOR the people and NOT corps so much-  Ford Credid with its "cross collateralization" would be a good start
#Sadness
#Greed
#NotServing!!!
I agree 100% that government is not serving their people accurately!!

Harry Reid senate &radical dems socialists(shared poverty)stop blocking money for zika stop playing with lives
not even good word salad
Paul Ryan can't DTs not done whip' the new party N2 shape Paul has a few more months getting fitted
maybe you should be supporting #jillnothill then @SenWarren #nodapl #demexit
keep fighting!!!@uliz
where's #RestoreTheVRA fall on the agenda? Do we have a chance and what support from constituents do you want?
Is that the same Wall Street that is in bed with Hillary? Pocahontas..
I wish I got a 7 week summer recess.....  Must be nice. I'll keep working my 2 jobs so dear leader can send more $$$ to Iran.
How can you point a finger at anybody when you're supporting crooked @HillaryClinton for Pres?
You back Clinton and she backs those bills.
Mayhap you can tend to your cushy Senate gig, and not worry about what the other chamber is doing? Just a thought.#MAGA
ist order should be the border bill with us #Canada
love you Babe. Gawd, they're tiring.
America does run on Dunkin tho
ur a 'public servant', admit the @SenateDems voted against 1.1 billion in Zika research funding
where is funding for #ZikaVirus
- @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan once again pathetic! Have you no shame? Retire.
U expected them or @SenateGOP 2 honestly return 2 work 'for the People'? Sorry, their only concern is @GOP in #LameDuck
Well they can work on lowering SS COLA next year from  .2% to .1% So instead of $2 on a 1000 it will be $1. Thanks
Must drive that message! This election is an opportunity for change. Public needs to get that!
@APhearman @HouseGOP actually 1st order of business was the survivors bill of rights, which just passed yesterday
GOP Senate has been worthless since day 1! Disgraceful! Taxpayers should replace them come Election Day! They got pd 4 nothing!

GOP has the become the party of sleaze bags. No ethics, no courage, no work, just Monkey Business.
Sen. Warren, love U & I'm with U on this, but U had a chance 2 do something bout it. U didn't run & didn't back Bernie!
Ya and... Your new BFF #CrookedHillary would be right in lock step with them. Her Bankster Buddies will love it.
I live in Florida and I cant believe that our Governor Scott is not there lobbying to Protect his citizens of State
Say what....
thx u 4 fighting 4 us #SenWarren
Obscene. Same old thing- protect big business and screw average citizens.
I would argue that if you think dems aren't shilling for rich corps you have not been paying attention
Right... But it's a GOP bill and they have the majority. You are correct tho- Dems deserve blame too
I just have lost all energy defending dems.  The total corruption has made me apathetic.

Let's send them a message in November. Your 'service' is no longer required! @SpeakerRyan your party is Pathetic!

@damkina @HouseGOP - the GOP has got to go - we have a country to run, & they're like a big block of concrete ahead of the bus...
..don't know how the GOP sleeps at night....they all have ice running through their veins...shameful
This is another member of @BarackObama WACKO Squad operating from her WigWam
Only wacko is you dude, go do something useful. Wigwam? Standing against Trump is the right choice-
thx for update
.@SenWarren @HouseGOP their priorities
What were you expecting?  That they suddenly started not liking getting as much money as possible?

Surely you are not surprised?
