We need better leadership, #wentzforcongress
I left WF for the same reason 3 years ago. Criminals like Stumpf,Tisdale should b in jail. 41$mill fine is not enough
This is exactly why good people are afraid of coming forward to report all kinds of violations, from abuse of power
why isn't the CEO in JAIL?  If Joe Commoner did what he authorized we would be in jail for fraud!
where were you for the past 4 years while you knew all this was taking place?
@hiltzikm @WellsFargo
@smsaideman @WellsFargo
Wells Fargo owes them back pay plus interest & pain & suffering if they are still unemployed or are tech homeless.
Dear @SenWarren: Let's talk when you and @TheDemocrats make a #bankster do the perp walk, OK? @BevDiane @WellsFargo
Thank you Sen Warren!!! So proud someone is going after these slimes and they need to face some jail time!!
they should be forced to hire them back, that is just bull shit.
- Fraud, Waste & Abuse as well as Code of Ethics training did not help these folks.
Wells Fargo took my family home in less than 3 weeks I was raped by my father without a safe place to go Wells Fargo
They should get the bonuses #RealCriminalsAreWhite
. With the $184 mil fine imposed.  How about giving a chunk to the 5300 fired employees?  They deserve some.
hope the employees are suing !
,
I hope they get a ClassActionSuit going & get paid #JustSaying
Hopefully, they will be able to form a class action lawsuit and get some real redress.
There is no accountability! This is getting out of hand!
give me a break they r scum just like him.They knew what they were doing to others They knew people by name basis they screwed
I was fired two years ago and blacklisted by Wells Fargo no bank will offer me employment :(
They should be rewarded by the fines Wells Fargo paid!
ms Warren I love you but how can you stand by and watch this email immunity continue ?? Your the last honest one
i love politicians. Faux outrage over obvious things to seem like they care for average person. Transparent and fake.
they knew about this. They just tried to get away with it as long as possible
Senator R U involved N the review of the Toxic Substance Act of 40 yrs. ago? If not, can U please help against Monsanto?
then do something to help the whistle blowers.
like Hillary's aids have been over her illegal activities
did the Indians ever rob stage coaches?
It was shocking to me when they opened up 3 new accounts in my name that I never even signed paperwork for. Criminal.
Good. See KARMA exist. Stealing from people. They swore up and down they did not enter my property. Lie lie lie.
The solution is making people personally responsible for their actions. See http://of-by-forthepeople.com/LincolnAmend/  It's included.
They should rehire these people & split Mr Stumph's salary among them.
Prosecution time!!!
That life in America
@BrianForde @WellsFargo @CNBC @NPR @HuffingtonPost @FT @WSJ - anybody watch @JimCarrey #FunWithDickAndJane movie? #MakeHimPay 
that's what should happen to you too for the fake Indian thing! Just saying!
Thanks for being one of the few in Congress with the courage and independence to represent the people, not power.
Will they be rehired...watching Yellen& WF's billions in profits 4 last yr alone would easily reinstate them
This is what happens when the rich have control!
disgraceful
NO reporting on Wells Fargo donations to Clinton?
Campaign. Foundation. Speeches.
Warren is a Hypocrite in search of a Sound Bite
The reparations of the bonus money should go to all those people that were forced to do this job, and then fired.
there are many additional corporations driving workers to cheat to meet unrealistic goals. #corporategreed
This should send make anyone with a Wells Fargo account VERY NERVOUS. Thank you Senator.
How can Wells Fargo be allowed to remain in business &how can they retain any account holders w/their awful actions?
a friend quit before the scandal due to the pressures put on him. If one did this there are more. Stumpf's criminal
@Cowboyzion01 @WellsFargo @HillaryClinton Loves #wallstreet & #bigbanks  largest campaign contributions @THExTRUMPxTRAIN
thank you not yielding to the corrupt and telling truth to power.
Trump would consider this another working day of getting wealthy without consequence. Thank you for your hard work.
as usual, whistleblowers punished because corruption at the TOP!
and nobody goes to jail. Imagine if one of the employees stole a few hundred dollars. They'd be in jail.
- Even most of the Dems on the House Fin. Services Committee are corrupt bank shills: Murphy, Himes, Delaney, Sewell, Sinema, Clay
The top executives still gets away
American youth shld work w @SenSanders 2 capture z senat's seats, 2 fight these acts.&select Supreme Court  Justice
did @WellsFargo not donate to the Clinton Foundation or give @HillaryClinton speaking series?
fired for fake emails..hmm...Hillary deletes thousands of emails exposing her and she runs for president
Excellent question but no one who COULD do something about it won't have the guts to do so! @SenWarren @WellsFargo
The logical solution would be to give CEO Stumpf's ill-gotten gains to them and put them on the board of directors.
@stevelackmeyer @WellsFargo yet she's backing the candidate that's taken the most donations from Wallstreet banks?
: THIS IS WRONG!!
Accountability trickle-down.
when do the victims of n short selling get taken care of # 15 yrs
kinda what the McGovern Commission and Clinton's did to Americans, consistently sell us out to the highest bidder! #BUST
Take them down!
the company also supports the #LGBT agenda and look where it got them. #disgusting
Not surprised!
PLEASE support a return of postal banking.
Lovely. Just <bleeping> lovely. Put someone in jail !
This is a crime and literally is stealing. Some executives need to lose their jobs and have criminal records. BS ENDS
So you bought and flipped their houses...????
Laws should be in place and enforced to protect the citizens, not the rich and powerful.
Congress has allowed, and will continue to allow banks to do whatever the fuck they want.. And you won't stop them.
#Strumpf #Drumpf They're all the same
While execs earned tens of millions of dollars each year. It's criminal any way you look at it.
shut up Pocahontas
What is wrong with people?  #karmaisreal
great job senator!
