Sellout!
Congrats on the Stalinist show trials reenactment.
Yes and between two of you angry nasty people there is not one class in finance or accounting!
Saw it, great interview. @SenWarren, if congress was full of you we would have a great country
Here it is & it's a masterpiece performance on a Senate Steinway:

u are AWESOME!! Just sad ALL Congressmen & women r not more like u!
you 2 are amazing ! Keep doing the good work you do !
..you going to be discussing what kind of criminal charges are to be filed? If not, worthless.

I was hoping U would be VOCAL about #Trump's misuse of charitable funds & payoffs 2 Bondi!
Senator may I say that you were a total badass.  #ironovaries. #yougogirl
the answer is yes, they are required to follow the law BECAUSE IT IS THE LAW!!!!!!!
I watched today, when it was asked if banks are obligated by law to self comply I was shocked
give 'em hell Liz!
Am closing my Wells Acct. Will move to a community bank,will reconsider if 5300 hired back and Stump resigns
Ask the oversight committee to investigate the emails of bill sponsors destroying dodd-frank
thank you Senator Warren for looking out for the common people...you ROCK!
So why can nothing else be done to @WellsFargo than what we saw?
you inspire me! Thank you for all your work on behalf of the everyday hard working populace.
love you two!!!
Barney Frank is the mother of the 2008 financial housing bubble, you don't know that ?
I've worked in the financial industry for 2 decades. You are my spirit animal! Thank you for your voice and for the fight!
As a WF customer of YEARS I agree with Elizabeth--FBI and SEC investigations & PUBLIC!!
such a tremendous fraud you are... HRC is this century's biggest criminal.
not a chance u sell out back knifing sellout ... & that goes 4 rachel too!!!
Sen Warren you should check into Barney Frank. That's where the housing crisis started!
two thuggers oh my
Great interview on Rachel Maddow tonight everything u say is right on
Our next POTUS Senator Warren Hillary needs u in her Cabinet for sure
do you actually care or is it just an act to get elected and grab more power and money?
More bs from Warren.
@kittyFitz50 @maddow @SenateBanking @WellsFargo That was great!
I can't stand her after the way to screwed @BernieSanders @DWStweets @HillaryClinton
finally someone holds one of these POS's feet to the fire! Bravo, Senator!
Stump Trum..Uh..Stumpf.
Missed it.
Love your energy Senator Warren. #IamWithHer #LoveTrumpsHate #NeverTrump #TrumpTaxReturns
good job today, senator. Thanks for standing up for the otherwise voiceless.
They have my 401k!!!! It's all I have!!! So scary :-(
Awesome job Today, Senator!!
I support HRC, but I hope you decide to run for in 8years HRC will be serving 2 terms.
can Trump be prosecuted for inappropriate use of foundation monies??
is Tumpf and Trump just a coincidence?
And yet U say nothing about candidates who take endless $$ from Wall St. @SenWarren @maddow @SenateBanking @WellsFargo
My children's late dad was a victim. I helped fight with them. They won. Stumps is a total ass. $187m is pocket change.
"Wall St wont change til we make it change".. & Hillary is the one 2 make it happen? Nice show @maddow @SenateBanking @WellsFargo
Sen. Warren, you were awesome today. Thank you for your service to this country.
why don't you talk about Killery Clinton and all the lies she has told to the American people
this is financial terrorism must be given toughest punishment
I'll be watching!

have you forgotten about corrupt schools ripping off student left with thousands of debt and a useless degree?
Just what a wanted to watch..two lesbian pseudo intellectuals spewing hate!
go get em
I saw it Cspan. It was nauseating. I was foremost impressed by your line of questioning. TYSM
Can't wait to watch.  Loved the video of you grilling the Wells Fargo exec
funny how last names similar with trump
Will you hold Hillary to the same standard as bankers and ask her to drop out of race? #Hypo
just make sure to point out the lack of fair legal review that HRC has received over and over
You fraud Obama hasn't arrested one banker! How about grifter Warren Buffet he controls WF.
@Always_Trump 
It's so unusual for you to working so much today! Must have had a red bull!
I will be tuning in
You ROCK Senator!
You detest bankers because your people have never used banks, only the White Man has them..
How much have Wells Fargo execs donated to the Clinton campaign & Foundation?
you SLAYED that ass hole!
Why don't you go after Clinton Foundation like you did Wells Fargo?
you are the Wo-Man
That hearing reminded me of why we need you exactly where you are - for now.  
You schooled him well!! #shameful
, @SenWarren U Talk Pretty,like David Sedaris! BTWtThat IS aCompliment!
http://tinyurl.com/jlsgnnj  #5YearsOGP
Go Senator Warren!!
his name is so close to Drumpf
Corrupt GOP will continue giving banks free rein without restrictions to loot/pillage
TY Sen.Warren for your service. We love you....
I hope she asks why you avoided Bernie to back the big bank candidate

Senator Warren, fantastic job today. Scam is spot on. CEO and senior mgmt should be fired.
If they arent going to jail, literally no one cares.
YGG!!
yeah they need to be in jail how are you planning on putting them there?
why did the Obama/Admin & his AG's let Wall Street and Big Banks off the hook with sub-par investigations over last 8 yrs
Sen Warren....you're so cool, you piss ice cubes! Keep up the fight!!! @SenWarren @maddow @SenateBanking @WellsFargo
Ahhhh, MSNBC, the bestest fake news this side of Fox. For "Progressives"
mentioning anything about police shootings? Cause u need to.
I worked hard to beat the democrats& establishment. Would u have voted for me?
you're my hero!
.@SenWarren @maddow @SenateBanking @WellsFargo Sen Warren, You destroyed John Stumpf today! Thank you!
