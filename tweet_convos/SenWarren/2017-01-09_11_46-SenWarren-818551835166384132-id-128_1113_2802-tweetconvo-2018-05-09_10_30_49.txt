Yes is sad how much hypocrisy they roll around, threating peoples health care while theirs 'REMAINS SAFE' .
No ethics, no hearings.
and yet we typically look for consensus. No more!
#Rosie #MerylStreep stop feeling sorry for #HillaryClinton. She is a liar, she is corrupt. She was not qualified. #Tatiana
I don't follow your logic. Streep should stop feeling sorry for HRC?
It's just typical response hon from Trumps paid whores. No worries they will see
Hope Dems remain strong and resolute and do not cede any ground to Republicans as they often seem to do.
need to oppose overreaching but need to try and get something done. Gridlock helps no one
@SenWarren @POTUS @SenateDems Please don't let them sneak these people in, they are ALL bad actors
thank you for standing up for ethics in government #NoEthicsNoHearing #TheResistance
RESIST
@SenWarren @POTUS @SenateDems my god what took you guys so long. I hope the Democratic keep the pressure up.
Keep at it. Don't give up
You and the rest of the democrats in congress have got to stand up to Trump and the republicans. Please.
Yes, merely saying they're unfair won't do
U must fight darkness for us. There is no honor in defeat here. Don't go quietly into the night. Rage on!

Thank You!!
@SenWarren thank you Senator Schumer!  Please keep at it! We are depending on you and all other Democrats to fight for us!!
Don't waste taxpayer money delaying the confirmations for self-serving grandstanding. You're pissing us off

Please be a strong group and stand up to this man.  Please protect the people of our country from him!

Reasonable care in the evaluation and selection of our trusted servants is all I ask for, and expect. How about it @SenateGOP ?

@SenWarren @POTUS @SenateDems is relieved that Marxism proponents are on the decline 
In 2013 @SenateDems nuked the filibuster to silence opposition from the minority party.
...
Was that not a good thing?
Hold them accountable.
@SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer @POTUS @SenateDems hypocrite, corrupt, liar. Hypocrite, corrupt, liar. Hypocrite, corrupt, liar.
@SenWarren @POTUS @SenateDems 
Fabulous!
The letter came after the Senate passed Obama's cabinet. Do the same now for PE Trump. We demand it.
DT, R's want extreme vetting for immigrants, but violate vetting process for DT's Nominees. Unacceptable!
Please send to the VP Pence - Christian, Conservative Republican. Maybe he can be an American too

Stand up to GOP Leadership.
@SenWarren @POTUS @SenateDems Hypocrisy 101
Chuck, Obama cabinet nominees had ethics reviews completed before senate hearings.
Do whatever your want stomp cry whine it doesn't matter Reid changed the rules no live with it
@SenWarren @POTUS @SenateDems #McConnell has a short memory. The last six years. Can't rewrite history
That was in the days of the filibuster
You made your bed
Sleep in it
except they are trying to push all their nominees through without background checks.  
#notmypresident

@SenWarren @POTUS @SenateDems McConnell letter dated 2/12/2009...AFTER multiple hearings and confirmations including Clinton.
@SenWarren @POTUS @SenateDems #HugelyHugelyHypocrites
@saraturner19 @POTUS @SenateDems You lie Chucky !
Source?
@SenWarren @POTUS @SenateDems Remember the @GOP r a bunch of hypocrites. Nothing new.
Thanks for staying on this. The people can see the hypocrisy. It's clear as day. The question is, what do we do about it?
@SenWarren @POTUS @SenateDems this should be standard operating procedure for vetting Cabinet members (and President Elects too)
Please Read Senator Schumer and share our Concern
And these pre-recs need to be met!
.@SenSchumer @SenWarren @POTUS @SenateDems This is AWESOME.Dems are showing people everything we know..Dems are Party of NO, NOTHING FOR US
I grew up in MA, took crap all my life for being born in NY. @SenSchumer just made me proud.
@SenWarren McConnell 2 Reid in 09:"financial disclosurs must b complete prior 2hearing being scheduled!"
@SenWarren @POTUS @SenateDems Do not confirm one person that isn't properly vetted. Ds quit capitulating.
keep calling out the hypocrisy.
Or a filibuster; like the one they nuked in 2013?
Would be handy now.
the difference is Democrats are pussies and Mitch plays Hardball
Are Dems on tv like Rep? They r everywhere!  Make news. Do something like Meryl Streep did.
@SenWarren @POTUS @SenateDems You must stand up to Trump.  You must!!  Please.
so why didn't you do this two weeks ago, three weeks ago????? Now we're up against the wall.
@SenWarren @POTUS @SenateDems But they Stalled Blocked and did nothing for 8 years
It's obvious that @SenateMajLdr believes in the "Do as I say...& not as I Do" rule of governing.

@SenWarren @POTUS @SenateDems the question is are you going to let them get away with this. Better not.
#resist #obstruct @realDonaldTrump cabinet nominees
except the request was completely ignored
Your phone has been busy all day - must follow the rules - no ethics disclosure, no hearing! Plus - no nepotism (son-in-law)!!
Love this! Hold the line on #confirmationhearings

#liberalprivilege
Mitch doesn't want anyone looking too deeply into his wife's background.  They might find something on him.

But we all know they play by different standards for Dems
But that won't matter now because the shoe is on the other foot. Keep them accountable, sir. We appreciate it
No reason why Trump nominees should undergo any less scrutiny that any other nominees in past.
don't let them get away with this. Fight, fight, fight!
what's your point here?
@SenateMajLdr what's up with this Mitch? I can't coach a little league team without a background check
To quote President Obama "We won". Enjoy Chuck!
Please deliver a copy of @SenateMajLdr letter from 2009 back to him. Ask for same rules for Trump nominees.

hold him accountable Senator
YOU CANNOT LET THIS HAPPEN, #STOPGOPHYPOCRISY
