New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall begins reading Coretta Scott King's letter on the Senate floor http://cbsn.ws/2k2WwLh  
@CBSNews glad you are accomplishing big things. Keep wasting tax $
He was able to because he had the requisite penis.
, Thank You!
.@SenWarren @aleesohnn WAIT. So it's okay for a man to read this but not a woman? Am i missing something?
What the actual hell? I know i shouldn't be surprised by this kind of thing anymore, but OMG.
KAREN! YOU SAID A NAUGHTY WORD!!!
I KNOW! THAT'S HOW UPSETTING THIS IS!
(Ali, I've been friends with Karen since 2006 & I've NEVER heard her swear. THIS IS SERIOUS.)
By the end of this presidency, I'll be straight-up swearing!
If you say the F word, let me know! 
lol always telling people they are victims, might want to try a different mantra to get some votes
@Plantflowes @SenatorTomUdall @CBSNews and THANK YOU @SenWarren for all you do. #Warrior
love the quote Mrs.King ....let me knowwhenur campaigning againis love to canvasforvolunteerinthecall center
Keep Speaking out! Dems should move to impeach Trump repeatedly Americans need to b safe #LetHerSpeak
@Dr_of_Nursing @SenatorTomUdall kudos Warren 4 taking a stand, ironic this is black history month&we r paying lip service no2Jeff
disgusted that sexism reigns over this Congress but thank you for trying and reading
nothing likes hurting Dr Kings legacy with your political nonsense!
yes thank you from all of in the Senator's state of Massachusetts. 4evaBrave! Sen Warren! Showin' some Backbone!
Thanks to all of you!
MLK's niece A. King, just said Sen. Warren played the 'race card'
Love you, Senator. Keep speaking the truth – America is with you!
Amazing! The National Democrat Socialist Party in action on the US Senate floor in its "putsch" action. FAILED
I believe it wan't the message. It was the messenger. Perhaps a little less contentious would suite you better.
#DorothyParker said doing well is the best revenge--and @senwarren got on the @Dailyshow, McConnell got xxxx!
grateful to Senator Tom Udall. Interesting though that it took a man to be able to read it on the senate floor!
There have been at least two others who also read the letter, including my Sen. Merkley.
both with penises, no?
All four senators were male, which is a strong message of sexism by Republicans
This antagonist position the Dems are taking will only continue to destroy democracy #civilsociety
why are male Senators reading letter but not Senator Warren? Asking so I can explain double standard to daughter
.@SenWarren @SenatorTomUdall Do you have video of all the Republican Senators sticking their fingers in their ears & yelling "LALALALA!!!"?
...#Childish
What is the big big deal about a letter written a citizen. Why is it being read and re-read. Making zero points
Becase it highlights how unfit Sessions is for D of J. Unfit, unacceptable and offensive
@SenSanders is reading it too!
would love to see all Dem senators read it. Shame shame shame on McConnell!
and all Dem senators to read what Liz would say on the floor while red carded too
That's my senator! Go New Mexico!
 yes!
well done. Please don't stop being our voices.
At least there are some people who care greatly about America and will defend it's integrity to a great degree!
True!! They are called Republicans.
lol.
All this grandstanding is for nothing. Warren will lose her 2018 Senate seat.
LOL in your dreams. Her popularity is off the charts in Mass
I live in Ma. Don't believe everything you read. We got Charlie Baker in.
Got kicked out did you Lizzie?

there's the maturity of the trash that supports democrats. Do you have one of those giant vagina costumes too, loser?
If you are insinuating the vagina outfit was worn at the Women's March, you are very wrong. @justpowers @SenWarren
John (don't) C Dick, 
Melania started pussy attire trend.
Why was @SenatorTomUdall allowed to and you not?
because he's a man and he's white.
it's all right if it's all white. Men, that is. Better a madman for Pres than woman
sounds legitimate. To them women should be home making babies and cooking
#FreeSenatorWarren
how many times are you going to read it ?
fight Trump
Many thanks to you, Senator Warren!
#AmericanPatriarchy still has a big problem with its #Matriarchs. #RespectWomen Respect #CorettaScottLegacy
Thank you for everything! 
@CBSNews way to represent New Mexico Senator Udall.
When the hell do we impeach. I can't take another day. Do we need to literally storm the castle?
I'm ready with my pitchfork. Every day is worse than the last...
Yay, thank you Senator Udall!
Thanks you for standing up to this administration, but yet it starting to sound a bit too much whining
Did you also show the video of King thanking Sessions? #Warrendrama
keep fighting Eliz. We are supporting you with resistance.
Very proud of our Congressman.
Mitch McConnell is a woman hater.
the is BS. - what are you going to do about it?
that's my Senator!  So proud of our delegation.  Keep it up!
@CBSNews 
Thank you for speaking up
You make me proud, your efforts may not yield intended results but thanks for standing up
Stop!!!! Focus on what is important! Live N the now! Session is a good appointee.Quit assasinating his character
New Mexico should be proud of their Senator. Too bad Colorado can only be ashamed of theirs! @SenCoryGardner
good work. Hmmm why wasnt he stopped sen McConnell???
#Neverthelessshepersisted
Senator Seasions has enough votes. Not only did you not get your way. Get ready to loose all your power 
courage!
keep it up you guys are awesome
how they treated u was disgusting!!
thank you, Sir
you guys ROCK!!!
@CBSThisMorning Why do men get to read this & she doesn't? Seriously?!? 
.....proud of Senator Warren- your voice matters.... keep defending our rights, if you don't no one else would.
If not for the rampant misogyny in @GOP, you would've been allowed to read it. Unacceptable.
Sick of the bs you are killing America.  Using the King name to dishonor another Senator. Shameful both of you
thank you for persisting!
Your race-baiting nonsense has been exposed as a fraud.
@womensmarch Thank you Senators Udall and Warren!!!! Vote no on Sessions!
thanks to you, but why not for Udall and not for you?
Playing the race card.that's all u have.
You are also such a model citizen Pochahontas!
They let a man do it?
@Freethoughtkaty @SenatorTomUdall they can read it all they want he still will get confirmed 
Good for Sen Udall, but why did McConnell silence Warren from ALL debate on Sessions but allow Udall to speak?
funny how a man was allowed to read it! #ShePersisted #elizabethwarren #LetLizSpeak #PowerofthePeople #Resist
I guess it is important to read it out loud for all your illiterate followers.
Thank you both. And they wonder why women march??
was he asked to stop and take his seat?
indeed
@JONWBRID @SenatorTomUdall  @SenWarren @SenateMajLdr   @elizabethforma #ShutLizUp #LetLizSpeak #WoofWoof   Sit Liz SIT! SDSTFU

Thank you Sen. Udall.
Yes.  But it took a white man to read it.  #LetLizSpeak.
thank you both! Now get every Dem to read it out loud. That will show McConnell he's the worst.
thank you for fighting for us every day 
love you both so much
Yes!
All the senators need to read it one by one..dems anyway!
So they'll listen to a man.
Yes! Thank you to Senator Udall and thanks also to you. #ShePersisted #letlizspeak
So only the WOMAN was silenced. Oh, I see. #WeWillNotBeSilenced
@CBSNews Wait WHAT????
Great, but why wasn't he sidelined? This double standard is so obvious.
Can you appeal your red card now that the same words were spoken by another senator?
Many thanks to you for your strength and persistence.
thanks Tom -- making NM proud.
Yep, that'll show 'em. Will make ZERO difference. Countdown to Sessions confirmation in 5...4...3
do not stay silent
@SenJeffMerkley thank you all; especially @SenWarren for persisting!
Yes, unfortunately people with penises *aren't* being disrespectful when they read it.
They're afraid of a powerful woman. Keep the pressure up.
RESPECT
Thank you for all you do. Keep fighting, don't give up or we all lose!
Thank you for fighting the fight.
GOP is afraid of you Sen. Warren! 
great job! Resistance, Persistance.
@mtnsoccerfan @SenatorTomUdall I'm so proud of my senator frm NM Tom Udall for standing up to the sexist action of Senate Rs!
WTG
Go New Mexico Land of Enchantment & my ancestors Senator Chavez Sen Montoya
thank you both for challenging the Senate to acknowledge these picks. "Like a bad movie"
you are such an inspiration THANK YOU for persisting 
thank you
@CBSNews Yet you were reprimanded. #doublestandards
Why could he read it but you were silenced? What "procedure" allowed that?
@CBSNews I STAND WITH YOU, SENATOR! #letlizspeak #Resistance
@CBSNews as long as they shut you up Pocahontas
Thank you!
Just a shame a woman was not allowed to share another woman's words.  So tired of the old boys club in Congress.
Thank you both for your courage and integrity. You are giving us hope!
Confused as to why he was not stopped and you were??!!
Thank you from New Mexico.  #letlizspeak
Ridiculous a woman was silenced but a white man wasn't.
Why was a male senator allowed to recite this letter without being silenced?
#LetLizSpeak
Thank you for #NoSessions #Ivote #whyIMarch #resist
thank you for leading the charge. I wish _my_ elected senators represented their constituents :(
it's not the letter they didn't want to hear it was your voice
Thank you so much for being strong and respectful and for standing up for what is right. We are behind you.
Long live the abhorrent SEXISM in our government. McConnell violated the first rule of 19 Rule interrupting her.
Warren for President 2020
Oh yes, just more of the Administration of Trumps so-called Offices, more bigotry.
and why wasn't HE stopped?  THE WORLD OF MAN IS WHY WE ARE IN THIS STATE OF CRAZY/BIGOTRY/WOMEN HATERS!
Hey MITCH you only try to silence women?  What a sexist racist hateful bigot mitch is!
Thank you both for representing millions of us who cannot speak.
Thank you! We need to #StandStrong to #stopSessions
@resistnow we will not be silenced we will not go quietly there WILL be consequences enjoy your jobs now,unemployment in GOP!!!
Sen McConnell, is Yertle the Turtle and a coward with a guilty conscience. Not fit for leading. Sad!
Thank you Mam! WeThePeople will replace @SenateMajLdr , for obtsruction, racism & now sexism. He must go. @SenatorTomUdall ty!
He wasn't silenced....hmmmmm....
Funny how he got to read it but not you. Either way the word is out, you are awesome! We look up to you. 
perfect our senators are now playing children's games on our dime $, looks like Trump wins again
you are heros in a sea of embarrassment in this country right now!!
keep up the good fight for the American  people. God bless.
just shows the GOPis afraid of your influence SenWarren, keep it up, proud of you
