I know why you say that ! Dream act all your democrap friends  take out loans sign Pedro Sanchez  then default them yes it's a dr
for you to
Think that trump even thinks that way shows your very poor judgement skills
Not everyone can parlay a lie into wealth and success like your claim to NAI heritage; if U can't prove your lineage it's lack of integrity.
And let's talk about those scam loans u had gotten. U should stay away from that subject!
_ Yeahhhhhh buddy!!! I bet Trump is dying to get into the HUD housing projects business.
what the hell are you talking about  ok well so why don't I qualify and why do you give them to illegal aliens ?

There's only on sector of the American people Trump is interested in helping: The have & the have more!
"@SenWarren: @HUDgov grants & loans must be about helping the American people ONLY – not @realDonaldTrump's personal fortune."
Where is the $120 trillion in worthless Bonds you sold to Social Security & Medicare. Let's talk about accountability shall we...!
They've never helped the people on friends of corrupt Congress.....
I can see it! Donald Trumps ribbon cutting in Lowell MA.. the Trump brand reaches the armpit of America.

DJT deals in high end property, not HUD property. He's no slumlord , are you Fauxahontas?
Really Fauxahontas? U can't be serious(?) Trump built 5-star properties around  NOT low-income housing
@MarleneUsaa1  WE ABSOLUTELY SHOULD NOT BE PAYING FOR THE WALL. He made the promise, let him pay for it.
You should talk after pretending to be native American- Pocahontas!! @HUDgov @realDonaldTrump
like the one's millennials missed out on that Non U.S. Muslim  Students got via democrats? Qatar speech
I guess I'm a @realDonaldTrump #BasketofDeplorables because I'm bothered by "hundreds of millions" NOT spent on 's 
AND affirmative action hiring should only consider minorities, not lairs claiming to be American Indian

For America's sake STFU!!
Commend Sen.Warren
She's intelligent, experienced, educated, knowledgeable,hard working, fearless.
@nikkipack1 @HUDgov @realDonaldTrump My hero!  My fellow Oklahoman, Elizabeth Warren!
Are you insane? You think DR Carson is going to funnel HUD money to Trump? Truly insane!
you didn't care when your bestie Hillary was doing it!
ridiculous. Now you are just making yourself look foolish.
this is probably one of the most incoherent things out of this woman's mouth.
grabbing at straws aren't you ? Would you have demanded Hillary put all CF money in blind trust ?? No
Will anyone in press ask Warren about $ going to, as she says 'American people,' and not illegal aliens?
This woman is not to bright  the last thing Donald Trump needs is money.
This woman is totally ignorant
I have never been as embarrassed 4 theas watching hearings. Accusations Absurd
Wow - Senator Warren prefers HUD recipients to be homeless.
- but that is what he does. My God woman, he is talking no pay to save America, do you want him homeless
Haters gonna hate! #youaremakingAmericaweaker
Hey Elizabeth you didn't mind making yourself rich on @HUDgov money .
Ben Carson is UNQUALIFIED!
Like Warren Buffet?
Like Dodd,Frank?
. Where were you when dodd frank was screwing over Americans
Is there anything you don't complain about. Maybe someone should look into your real estate deals.
Sorry @SenWarren, the elected have had known/unknown interests in properties that benefit from fed prgms. Clean it for all not just Trump
- stop stuffing your own pockets, do you think no one knows? Your pissy because you LOST. No one is crooked or thieving but u
Isn't Trump the guy who bought prime real estate in Cambridge for dirt cheap then flipped immediately.....oh wait that was you
Do you work or just tweet all day
But that's why Donald became president - to make money and pay off debts.
Thank you-PEOTUS comes from an unknown world. Dangerous. We will never see an inaugeration like this one
Republican GOP=GREED OVER PEOPLE .  Shamefully abusing their elected positions over constituents
Claims he's billionaire but this gambit will help boost the huge amount he's in debt.  Showca$ing manipu
Loans must not be allowed increasing interest nor changing agreements after contracts are agreed fair.
Trump only flits about while his businesses expand.  We are expendable.  Goal: too-big-to-fail planted
A FAKE INDIAN, PHONY "ANTI-WALL ST" STUNT. U ABANDONED IT DURING PRIMARY 2SUPPORT PRO-WALLST HRC. What exp u had b4 run 4senate?
U still have 5 days to get the problem solved. I suggest u lazy lying Pocahontas delusional Dumbass Start moving your nasty ass.
Is being this dumb you dumbass the norm for you?
Did you really believe by questioning DBC they way u did was going to pass over our ears and brain and not call u out.
Well Pocahontas I am am concerned. Some of the monies that he took was some of my tax dollars.
Exactly what department did he get 4 billion in cash that he gave to Iran. Where exactly did he get it? And you r not concerned!
R U always this stupid? Donald Trump is going to rob HUD.
What in the hell is this current secretary doing that he is so busy he cannot remove lead out of public housing? Inept!
8 Yrs under the obama administration and they still done anything to remedy this problem.
where has obama been the last 8 yrs. Instead he was helping illegals and refugees, not Americans
Why is it if U R concerned about led poisoning, why hasn't the current Secretary of HUS done anything about this issue.
True who has been helping the last 10 years POLITICS IS NOT SUPPOSE 2 B A life long gig

But DOE grants and loans are different?  America is fine with Mr Trump as he is or we would not have elected him. Stop it

@MAHAMOSA @HUDgov @realDonaldTrump sooo...Donnie isn't American enough? I'm embarrassed for you, Elizabeth.
@MAHAMOSA @HUDgov @realDonaldTrump but his monthly loan payment is 15million $$$, how is he supposed to support his lifestyle?
What about the growth of your personal wealth since you have been in office, senator?
WoW...he's making out like a bandit. & the 19% cut he gets after he gets rid of sanctions...4getBoutIt!
how does it help trump? I think Trumps lawyers know more than you!
your delusional Pocahontas. Do you really think Trump deals with HUD properties? Term limits! #DTW
Liz you are a crockpot with a serious case of lying whining bully!
Just say NO to Ben Carson! Lacks stamina and knowledge. Thank you Senator!
Claimed 2 b a Native American n scored $350,000 2 teach 1 class.Tell us how u Iives in a 5.4M mansion?

ya cause Dems never give those things to their cronies or favor their own interests.
how about scholarships?
You lost, we won. Go away.
You are a bitter warrior. Ugh... Your post makes no sense. Suprise!!!!
Pocahontas you have no clue how HUD works! Trump doesn't need money! He loves this country.
Funny you don't worry about American money when it hits to illegal immigrants.  How typical.
This is rich coming from Hillary's buddy who got rich "working for the people".
Carson had a fabulous response and YOU are absurd!!!
isn't Donald trump one of the American people?
How come U didn't question "red diaper baby" Julian Castro about continuing to impoverish minorities in HUD property? You agreed with him!
Warren who lied & said she was Native American now wants you to believe she smarter than a brain surgeon ! @realDonaldTrump
thank you Senator for your pointed questions.
So no person has or will ever made a profit with HUD money? Really!!!???
This needs to be stopped post haste!!!!
Career politicians increased debt, waste, fraud 20trillion, not honest business man elected. He'll fix
ok so just bc it's a Trump dev, all of the people in those buildings shld suffer bc of ur Pochapolitics?
it was a fair question that was answered clearly.  Keep to the facts and not manipulating info for party
that's the only reason he was maneuvered into office to turn America into an ATM for the rich

Im thinking4years would be good4the country. Bad for spec int, lobbyists, career pols, corps
Witch Warren, go after HILLARY for the 6 BILLION DOLLARS she lost.
like all those Clinton fun. Donations went to help Hatians right?
#Irony 
You made your fortune flipping houses
owned by poor people
#Irony 
the white Liberal who's made her mark 
pretending to be an Indian 
Finds moral high ground 
and scholarships for natives should go to REAL natives. Pay back what u STOLE!
#BarronMustMove did not deny that he would not help them make money on any deal. #DishonestCarson
No worries there.  Carson said he would make sure HUD helped NO american.
You r so incredibly arrogant. All. You've done since becoming a Sen. is so burdensome to consumers!
Regulations to try to stop another crash are so damn burdensome.
Why do you suspect Dr. Carson will help Trump make money? Is it because of your own money gain while in office?
C'mon Pocahontas you made money flipping houses and i bet you had inside info and padded you pockets
E.Warren get over yourself. D.Trump has enough money without having to "steal" from Americas unlike you
Mrs. Warren you will be accountable to your creator. Your actions reveal you don't care for the people!!
clarify for me how is ok HRC can accept $ from foreign governments? Your a hypocrite! Shame on you!
Mrs. Warren you're an embarrassment to our country. You lack moral integrity & frankly should step down!
YOU ARE A JERK. What a hateful tone you took with an honorable man @RealBenCarson -this is why Dems LOST
can not believe any branch of government believes it proper to line there pockets on programs 4  poor.
just wait til you see what Don has in mind for the deficit!
BS
but you and Obama spent billions bringing refugees in while our own people and vets starve and die.
You should NOT have attacked @RealBenCarson this morning!He is an HONEST American!Grandstanding was wrong! This was more about your agenda!
@mccraw_birkie5 @HUDgov @realDonaldTrump Ms. Warren you should rent your house out for Sec. 8 beneficiaries.
I encourage YOU to vote Yes for @RealBenCarson You will find that that He will be very helpful to finding amazing solutions to YUGE problems
when the nation's debt is eliminated, the Trump family deserves 20% of anything in the black. MAGA
Warren was that the best you could come up with?
Should only be used to subsidize teepee's and wigwam's
What grants are you refering to loser? Tell us! Let's see your pitiful tax returns Liz! I need to laugh!
You help Hillary, Reid, Obama bilk americans with a tax disguised as ACA now you want accountability WOW
You loon. Far left tirade directed at B Carson claiming BS accusations of Trump family. A billionaire doesn't need HUD $.
Because billionaires are satisfied with what they have, and don't grasp for more?
I didn't ask a question. It was preposterous disrespectful moment by Warren. Your cynical. DEMs grandstanding
Your statement that a billionaire wouldn't need HUD is correct. But when is greed restricted by need?
Not every wealthy person is 'greedy'. Warren shouldn't be persistent touting erroneous nonsense.
. It's always dooms day and hate from Warren.
yea trump will profit from section 8 housing. What's the matter with you
Exactly! Sect.8 construction contracts dnt mean anything 2 some1 who builds hotels & golf courses.
Keep up the hard questions... You're doing a Great job! Thank you!
fake news
Big Bank penned @HUDgov grants & loans @SenWarren must be about helping the American people ONLY - not @realDonaldTrump US Gov't Fortune
@RealBenCarson Seriously, he can't even answer a simple Q.
are you saying no more illegals can move in. Finally you get it or is it another lie Poco?
When will Congress do what's right for us the People. We citizens have been nothing but pawn in this..
Wait, didn't U endorse "dead broke 2 $Millions" Hillary?
Yes, we certainly don't want a replay of the Clinton corruption.
Hypocritical Elizabeth Warren Turned Profit Flipping Foreclosed Houses
UnIike his daddy. None shouId buiId a forture off the backs of some and excIuding minorities.
Obama got rich & came from his well to do family, that didn't make you rich.
What? President Obama did not come from a weaIthy famiIy to my knowIedge. Do you know otherwise?
his only motivation for being president is his personal fortune. Am I the only person who sees this?
I've saying this since day one. It's to bad we can't see how much money he made from before and after election
shouldn't he be exempt from bidding on projects?  Too late to pass a rule or law.
Agreed, @SenWarren, however, based on Dr. Carson's senate hearing, he's Trump's "boy."
Oh my goodness, Sweetie. What planet do u live on?
i have the solution...GET RID OF HUD!!

Lizzy u prove every time you open your mouth that u r lacking in brain function
