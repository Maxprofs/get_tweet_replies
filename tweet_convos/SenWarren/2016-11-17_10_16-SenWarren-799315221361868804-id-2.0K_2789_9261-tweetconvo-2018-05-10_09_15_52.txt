Atta girl! STOP TRUMP STOP BANNON
Trump took a total of $20,000 from Wall Street. Hillary took over $70 million. So what exactly are you talking about?? #fearstroker
racism, xenophobia, con artist... Take your pick! That swamp he talks about.. He's filling it up
then how do you know you are hearing the truth from your media?
good to hear
You rolled over like a pig in the mud for Hillary
THE ONLY PIG IN THIS SCENARIO IS TRUMP!
why because he said "grab her by he pussy" ha come up with some new catchphrases
no, not at all just the over all douchbaggery of everything he said
all of the things that were blown out of proportion by the #msm trying to make him look
So what I saw him say on TV and in person was not real?
ohhh did the #robot fry out his memory chip and can't answer specific questions ?
no I have a life- you should get one- you'd like it
@kathys_garden
And if you would have endorsed #BernieSanders in the primary we probably wouldn't be in this situation.
We'd b facing complete economic/societal collapse if Bernie & Elizabeth implemented their Marxist vision
Enjoying the Kool-Aid?
Haha! I believe in free enterprise that built this country, not the koolaid redistributed b Progressives
Very original comeback.
Saw your profile. Not sure how much u read. I read alot. I find the real friend of freedom 4 all 2 b the Buckley conservative
Well then you're reading the wrong things, because the things that you're reading are obviously bullshit.
Dissapointing.Did not think u would resort 2 foul language. 4 a moment I thought we'd have cordial disagreement. Should have known
way to stop the country's divisiveness!
tell that to @SenSchumer who is already giving in. Worst pick ever
coming from the woman who lied about being Indian to get certain advantages in life
your corruption DNC blocking Bernie you all get what you deserve ..the DNC and you are as dirty as the clintons
u need to roll over & get your lying tongue out of the ass of @HillaryClinton and give #Potus @realDonaldTrump a fair chance.
Hilary seemed very close with Wall Street but you didn't have a problem then?
.@SenWarren .@realDonaldTrump Pocahontas, why are you still talking? Everything you ever said is wrong, quit already.
@Plantflowes @realDonaldTrump Im dubbing my part if NJ the show me state . Sue me
Thank You Senator Warren...one of the very few hopes we have left. 
@SenWarren and @CoryBooker our winning ticket for 2020
Ummmm, Are you insane? that was Obamas doing the last 8 years . Have you been drug tested lately? No seriously?
I hope you are correct, but I have a feeling that Amerika is more interested in their cell phone service. So sad
Wall Street voted with their money on the chick you endorsed. Heap big lie! @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
Wall St prefers stability in DC. Trump is a destabilizing force. The economy will tank under DT
please. Take a deep breath. Stocks skyrocketing since Trump won. Highest EVER. #MAGA
They've been doing that for years. Trump hasn't even been inaugurated.
Trump speaks for all of us ...your lil world that everything is OK the democrats called the divide in the US
Please, Delete your account and get to work!!
Yet the Dimmycrats prepare to do what they do best -- CAVE IN.

@MatherDf15eagle @realDonaldTrump How can this be a viable election?? It's been influenced by Russia,Fake News,Comey, fake emails
 your diaper smells - put down the play doh 
u realize that selections were flipped to HRC - never 1 story flipping to DT
Republicans didn't crash economy. Bad loans mandated by CRA did. U know it. Stop lying.
#AuditTheVote Russia is confirmed to have rigged the election in so far 5 states.
lol!!! Keep trying moron!! Your free loading followers who got loans they could never pay are the guilty party!
Wall Street was for Hillary. Follow the money. All of their campaign donations went to her.
What the hell is Miss Jane here talking about?  Her party's been in power for 8 years!
Warren you are dumber than a box of rocks. Ignorance is NOT becoming #MAGA
Give em hell Elizabeth! 
you're a terrible role model for young women. Stop spreading lies. Educate yourself. And grow up.
you are a hypocrite and a NASTY woman! YOU cannot be trusted!!
He took $20k. Your girl took $70 mill. She was in bed with them. You can't even keep your lies straight.
the only crashing was done by your side. Bill Clinton's Dodd Frank did it all. YOU ARE SO AWFUL! TRULY!
But senator don't you think you & #DNC are best served by finding out how to win back 68 admin posts you lost?
Many people don't remember that it was under Republicans that the economy crashed. They can do it again
But it was result of bad loans mandated by CRA. R u familiar with CRA? It caused the "Great Recession"
Thank you!
: Pocahontas are you REALLY that ignorant? You were 100% behind Hillary the biggest thief of all time
Hey there, Pocahontas. Wall St bankrolled @HillaryClinton, not @realDonaldTrump. Cancelling TPP against Wall St.
and what the fuck do you think Shillary was going to do?
So, how is your rude awakening going, dear? We have chosen our new President and are very happy! Get a life!
y'all (DNC) rolled over for HRC, & now y'all wanna pay attention?Focus on #election2020 and bring integrity back to the (D) party
Dem party has not had integrity since JFK
thanks!  I mean it, but let's tackle the bigotry too.
The fake injun @SenWarren opens her trap once again.
You mean like when Obama did that?
u take money from @MoveOn which gets a lot of money from @georgesoros  a wall Street insider
If you think you can govern without the congress, the White House, and the approval of the people, you are too.
I didn't thing there could be greater hate and evil than Harry Reid but HERE YOU ARE! a female Harry Reid.
I guess you got a rude awakening. Your economy was disastrous.20 Trill in debt. Nothing to show for it. 40+% real unemployment.
LOVE @SenWarren.
If @realDonaldTrump thinks we’re going to just roll over while his Wall St buddies crash our economy again, they're in for a rude awakening.
Hey genius. Trump took 20k from Wal Street whilst Hillary received over 70million. You're a complete joke 
Uh, as we learned when you backed wall street/clinton-yes, liz -you'll roll over.
great for you. Be tenacious.
What Wall Street buddies? Again the lies flow so readily from your mouth! Incredible you can sleep at night.
.@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Your continuous phony outrage is exhausting and it doesn't work. Try being part of the solution, not screaming.

Do you realize that Hillary was funded by Wall St and Sen. Warren endorsed her?. Trump only got 20K from Wall St/Hillary 70Mil
so you... don't know anything about the guy you voted for. Great stuff.
I'm talking about Wall St. donations. So, what are you taking about?.
oh I see, you believe Trump didn't take Wall Street donations?
I feel like you aren't working with a full deck. I spoke on how much he has taken. It doesn't come close to Clinton.
so it's about relative quantities? Do you believe Trump *didn't* take every penny he was offered at every opportunity?
No? Nothing?
If you really cared you would have supported Bernie in the primary. You know the real financial reform candidate
The Marxist! Have u ever heard of the USSR,Cuba,Venezuela? These failed states reflect Bernies vision
Not really. Bernie's vision is closer to Denmark or Canada, pretty successful countries.
Both countries support their citizens more than we do, & their people are much healthier.
Dont know that 2 b true
I do know that to be true. If you're interested in reading: http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2016/jan/international-profiles-2015 …
Healthcare costs are much lower in both Denmark and Canada and and outcomes are much better than the US.
Those countries don't let the pharma industry suck money from the system. And people don't go bankrupt for healthcare.
Warrior #Warren Fighting For #WeThePeople! I Doubt @SenWarren That #Trump Would Ever Believe That You'll Roll Over For His #WallSt CRIMINALS
#AuditTheVote NOW
There were NO criminal acts by Hillary. It was a witch hunt, she was set up. You were lied to & now you have 2 live with a fraud.
Tell us again, how much Wall St money Trump took vs Hillary. 
YOU'RE in for the rude awakening
you Democrats are in the minority good luck with that
it was your corrupt candidate who took $70 million from Wall St while Pres elect Trump took $20 thousand!
you are a sore loser and a liar.
well these Bernie kids just rolled over for him so yeah....get used to it.
That is the most moronic statements I heve ever read. You are part of the cancerous thinking destroying the USA.
Who are you kidding. You have undermined my family and friends. Get ready for real life at your next election!
are you even aware of wtf is actually happening in the real world?
FRAUD WARREN SCREAMING WHAT?NETFLIX $60B+ LOOT PONZI SCHEME BY GOLDMAN SACHS/MARY JO WHITE/OBAMA GANG AT DOJ/FBI
Illinois Pension Funding Ratio Sinks To 37.6% As Unfunded Liabilities Surge To $130 Billion
Hay Pochahontass go back to your libtard teepee  #Trump2016

Shaddup fake injun!
And yet Elizabeth, you didn't seem to have a problem with #Hillary doing even worse!
stock market seems to like him. NEWSFLASH Hillary LOST!
Umm, it was Hillary giving speeches to wall st.
Actually you're the one that got the rude awakening. Silent majority ain't silent no more. habitually miserable @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
Lie-a-Watha, chief Spreading Bull, delete your account you lying self-interested, pearl clutching phony! #Trump

warren is trash & her hypocrisy is noticeable ,Just quit destroying this country and leave president trump alone
Where's your money senator. Ha ha ha ha
shut up Fauxcahontas what's your great Injun name? Dances With Donors?
Whole thing was nothing but bait and switch
U r fear mongering
Hey @SenWarren ... he won. Give up. @realDonaldTrump is going to be your commander in chief. He'll be your boss soon. Enough poison already
no one has ever done this whenever someone won or lost! Its freaking rediculious!
It's not Trump who hollowed out the economy with $20 trillion debt, that's on you folks!
#DrainTheSwamp
#HilaryClinton took $70 MILLION from WallStreet while #PresidentTrump took $20k. Go get tested for Alzheimer's
that is laughable! don't you remember Hillary's speeches to Goldman Sachs
@Kita71 @realDonaldTrump you wont be rolling over you will be rolling out.
next 4-8 years plus next 30 scotus  , put that in your peace pipe and smoke it
Are you out of your mind? The Dems are the party of Wall Street. Trump got virtually no support from them.
advocated for a candidate backed by ~$70,000,000 from Wall St interests; @realDonaldTrump ~$20,000.
Pocahontas are you smoking the wacky weed again? HRC took over 70 million from Wall Street! #idiot
Nut job.  You need to resign and find a reservation to live on.. wait they can't happen how about a campground
You rolled over for Clinton, whose middle name may as well be Wall Street. You're a sellout
But, the economic signs are UP since the election.
why are you trying to destroy American auto dealers?
SenWarren... you are #fakenews
ur stupid  Sen HRC and left taking all the WS cash stop ur lies hope u get voted out of office for good
.@SenWarren A good start would have been endorsing Sanders. The fact you didn't shows what kind of spine you bring. Bupkes.
Hey dummy..Clinton is the Queen of WallStreet
FWIW....I think most independents associate Wall Street cronies with the Democratic Party. #JustSayin
Please help us Senator Warren!!!! We need you more than ever!!  #doomed

U need mental help.Hillary was Wall Streets go to girl they gave her campaign 70 million dollars. Gave Trump 0
don't take this personally but you're insane.  I think you're confusing  @realDonaldTrump with candidate you backed. Nice try.
we might even try some anti-trust enforcement since monopolies are still illegal, right?
.@SenWarren how much did your candidate rake in from Wallstreet speeches & campaign contributions?  #draintheswamp @realDonaldTrump
Wall Street has been running up 8 years on the teat of Obama, World bank $ and  promise of HRC corruption.
Hilary Clinton, your candidate, took over $70 million from Wall Street. Trump almost nothing. Hypocrite.
Wall Street funded @TheDemocrats candidate for President.
are you delusional?  How many tens of millions did your candidate take again?  You're a fraud.
Democrats pulled economy out of near depression,guess in another 4 yrs the people will vote for Democrats again?
if only there was some measure where a simple majority couldn't confirm appointments. Good job!!!
Hey Lizzie…YOU and your Democrat buddies are PROVEN to be the cause of the crash. Want evidence?
you're going to be under investigation for pay-for-play very soon you better worry you are corrupt and Hillary
SEN WARREN... YOU WERE A SURROGATE FOR THE GOLDMAN SACHS POSTER CHILD....
You've been so effective to date I'm sure you mean business this time?
so fight everything?? Not going your way, so lie cheat and steel, that is the Lefts way of doing things.
Like #CrookedHillary you're a #nastywoman w/ so much anger/hate in your heart, #Fauxcohontas 
#PresidentTrump
you're crazy and live in a pretend world-please check into the nervous hospital
funny you supported @HillaryClinton who got way more money from Wall Street you're a fucking hypocrite
trump got 20000 ....he can probably return it. Can you?
hey goofy your candidate took 70 million from Wall Street and they owned her just do us a favor and shut up
we really have to let him do it. Remember, there are 60 mil people who brought him to power because they believe in his ideas.
Good lord, your psychotic is showing!

@realDonaldTrump
@rawideasinc @realDonaldTrump preach
Hey @SenWarren you are part of the problem. Wake up.  @realDonaldTrump
Ah shut up!
Hillary was the wall street candidate not Trump..
so why don't you run to be the head of your party? Oh wait! Maybe cause they don't care about u or ur opinions.
People just don't seem to understand
Wow the regulator in chief speaks! Can he be sworn in even before you start accusing people of not building it?
You can criticize him for a lot of things, but being owned by wall street isn't one. Considering they own you.
Trump took a total of $20,000 from Wall Street. Ur candidate took over $70 million. So exactly WTF ru talking about Fauxcahontas?
Ummm...you actively supported Hillary, right? Wall Street's Chosen One? Kinda nullifies your outrage.
.  Liz, project much. The Dem has the bankers and WS crowd on a tight leash, you included.
This is exactly why you LOST!  Because you still think we don't know that Wall St OWNS you!  Thanks for playing!
Do all people a great favor and resign. Ignorance isn't an excuse for the damage U do.
good for you Liz
With all due respect, ma'am, it appears there is action you can take on our behalf and we'd be obliged if you did. #TheResistance
@RichardPeppas @realDonaldTrump Wallstreet is the LEAST of our problems now.
Quit squawking.

#Trump #MAGA
Excuse me Sen #hillary took hundred of millions @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
Except that federal housing policy caused the crash, but that doesn't fit in your narrative, does it?
you can't blame one agency or even the govt for the collapse. Greed from bankers. Speculators too.
#WallStreet has only yours and your #LiarBuddies friends. #Trump owes them nothing! YOU and ALL dems #Liars
Took no money
YOU KNOW WHO DIDHILLARYCLINTON!
GLOBALISTGO HOME
YOU'RE HRC's PUPPET

if anything it will be @POTUS crashing the economy before January 20 to bring in your so desired nwo
- What Have You Accomplished In Life That Gives You Any Credibility On This Issue? What Have You Done In Senate?
I truly hope so!
