shame on you Senator Hatch
what about stealing and benefitting from a native American heritage???
can you prove she doesn't have native background? You obviously know nothing about native life
Gimme a break, it was proven years ago!
Proof? Otherwise we call this baseless claims.
Spoke like a true home flipper! Well done fake Indian!
Tomahawk Betty flipped at least five properties for profit on her "OK reservation".
- For "fake" in the dictionary, see pic of @SenWarren. Stole Cherokee heritage for career advancement.
I know, really, right? I wish I selected Native American on Holy Cross application

You talk about the Republicans, right? In that case, you are correct.
nope! Talking about Pocochanas the democrat
Sad the Democrats have to lie, explains why the White House went Republican in 2017
She's the only senator who seems to fight for us Democratic
if I'm not mistaken, you and your brother were quick to buy foreclosures. HYPOCRITE  OH...you forgot about that, I didn't
Senator Warren take a Valium and get over it
@HillaryClinton @donnabrazile @SenatorReid
The issue is men choosing their own $$ with NO regard for people they are choosing to destroy. #SenateHearings
True @POTUS didn’t, but neither did he make 1 move 2 end ANY these tactics
@BUSHADEMOCRAT @SenOrrinHatch
Actually,I'm not so sure you could be 100% positive about that. Something's gotta pay for Obama's NBA team
The swamp water gets thicker everyday!!
whatever
@carm2158 @SenOrrinHatch @POTUS Good 'ol whiney Hatch, voice twin for Pat Robertson, has to be a quadruple diamond  Lamanite
When you have liars loans makes lying debt collection occur. Happened to me http://criminalforeclosure.webs.com/apps/photos/ 
need structured, ongoing LOUD facts campaign in response to reps & resolutions to fix issues discussed, leadin '18 & '20
ALSO need to separate campaign from dem party AND from media. & run dirty '20 presdn'l campaign. go high doesn't work.
only been closely following repubs for a few days. mindblown @ the # of blatant dishonest crooks. swamp?
How dare you suggest a sitting Sen take a Valium, with all the prescription drug abuse. #SelectiveStupidity
Republicans supporting Mnuchin appointment make me sick.
@Auzzielvr @SenOrrinHatch  even listening to menuchin readin his openin was an embarrassment. He didn't even write it.
#dems women always remind me of that divorced crazy dog lady neighbor that is always yelling at everyone
Hatch is 4 the foreclosure of millions of seniors? We will let his voters know he puts Wall st over them
WOW. The Republicans just keep proving they don't care about the people of this country
Sen, Warren, are you capable of truth telling?
Maybe tone down on the POTUS mentions? Prior tweets will be amazingly awkward when the acct changes hands.
There is something quite wrong w this man. Have you seen how his mouth works? This man knows he is lying.
@TheBaxterBean @SenOrrinHatch @POTUS He bought mortgages from banks,had Ppl immediately evicted.They protested at his home f days
all gabinet is a dum ass
@ShaunKing I'd like to see some1 question him abt. the Peteo dollar. If trade is hurt nations will pull out of petro$ hurting US$
@ShaunKing @SenOrrinHatch @POTUS Why didn't Kamala Harris prosecute him while she was Cal's AG? Oh Right, he donated $ to her.
Oh Of Course!!!  THANKS OBAMA...That is going to be the escape goat!!! It all went wrong because of OBAMA!
@jo_revelette @SenOrrinHatch @POTUS. U, R right @SenWarren they R giving him no questions &the1's they R giving don't make sence.
unconscionable. Don't let these things go unchallenged
#WhiteSupremacy blames Pres. Obama 4 everything. Don't let them get away with #WhiteLies. @realDonaldTrump
More unadulterated poppycock from @SenOrrinHatch. This person apparently has no guiding ethics or principles. #ResistHypocrisy
this site: https://maketwittergreatagain.io  it is like Thunderclap but just for Trump.
also Russia didnt force DNC to rig elections in favor of HRC and against Bernie
Thank you, Senator Warren! Please keep calling these thieves out.
another set of Lies. This time we have the president involved.
tell them Liz
@SenSanders 
 You bet on & backed a corrupt& Corporate Whore We could be celebrating POTUS Sanders.But you & Dem. party sold out
Slick Liz was one of the gov. regulator that made the rules that the ppl had to live by
question:  Who orders Orrin Hatch to lie?
liz you are full of it
Sen. Hatch, that is shameless. And I am unsurprised. #partybeforetruth
The American Way 
After Me You Come First
Whaaaaaaa.  Guess what?  It doesn't matter what you think Pocahontas. :-)  He's in.  Anything we want is in.
Oh, that old "Barney Frank made the banks loan money to poor people" trope. No! Housing bubble was driven by Petrodollar & Chinese liquidity
Some lawmakers should retire; others are working hard to explore nominee views. Thanks Senator Warren.
I'm baffled why you don't go after John Lewis for tax evasion. http://theamericanfirst.com/john-lewis-paid-zero-property-taxes-on-million-dollar-d-c-townhouse/ …
Hey Lizzy, why do you waste your time. Your voice has no meaning since the Republicans own you

 @SenOrrinHatch @POTUS
Thank you Elizabeth, we will have to forgive those  talking about fake news and save them too.
His record is truly disgraceful.  Any senator with a conscience should vote no on Mnuchin.
I traveled throughout the state helping homeowners fight foreclosure. The banks were cold, uncaring.

I sincerely hope some of these cabinet picks WILL be released. Especially DeVos.
Lying is in you and all democrats DNA.
your hateful tweets will not stop Trump from being OUR next POTUS.

. I imagine most cringe and roll their eyes when you speak during meetings.
Chairman Hatch feels he must defend Nominee Mnuchin after every question. Hatch, you are not the nominee.
He foreclosed on 38K seniors in CA that were duped into the reverse mortgage scam.  @BernieDoesIt @SenOrrinHatch @POTUS
Sen.Warren made a bunch of money by flipping homes lost by poor owners. Give 'em back/ send them checks 
Deny nominees- all unfit
U R so dishonest & don't care. Will never B #POTUS. Incapable of working w/ anyone who disagrees w/ U. Ur an embarrassment.
didn't you buy many of those homes at the diminished price and flip them for a profit
I believe you need to look at your selves
Bef crash she blamed on speculators, Sen Warren made a bundle by flipping houses she bought in foreclosure.
U R the most illegitimate Sen in Congress. Lied abt heritage. Condecsending & rude. Unable 2 work w/ other side. Filled w/ hatred
No heart, or Mnuchin would have made it right when advised...like DJT said,"it's good business"..no soul.
Warren is one of the biggest scams in the nation!
ONG!
Scary that U R a Senator and know less about financing than me.And I'm just a little person with a mortgage
and congress shouldn't write laws without ensuring all legal boundaries or loopholes are addressed!
Wow - you're outraged again. What a surprise  Impossible to take you seriously when outrage is 24/7
Wasn't it the law that made banks steal homes. Who law was it? No one cares about you except Mass.
Didn't you buy some of these homes and flipped them to make a profit?
@DarHuddleston I see you as a racist and a fascist and a bad loser
so Beth, your admitting to buying stolen property and selling it for a huge profit.   No credibility!
keep asking the tough questions!
you bought foreclosure homes and resold. Unbelievable ur stupidity. You will loose ur next election
ok ms home flipper
why does #Mnuchin keep mention his 100 million in real estate? He is such scum.
Trump is our President on Friday!!! Yes!!!! 
Jobs for US,TrumpPres for All; Divider is gone!!!
did u return your fraudulent donation from Thornton Law Firm,no right? Please!!!
Even if the POTUS would be responsible, wouldn't it be Bush's not Obama's?
Read more here http://dollarjob.online/?ref=127844 
you lie as Saul Alinsky taught. So sad.
a simplified tax system & simplified gov would solve a lot of these complicated issues.#Mnuchin
Your hatred for Conservative Americans is glaring and has no place in our UNITED States Gov.
TY! Following GOP Civil War Era nullification of President Obama -- Don't let GOP get away W/more #BigLies
Mnuchin is like looking into the mouth of one of the largest gators in the swamp
if only you'd realized hillary wasn't the one to stop the beast and backed bernie
legalized robbery of the American people.  Also, can we stop his Soliloquies....
How could ANY reasonable person foreclose on the elderly for a whole 87 cents? #NOtoMinuchin
ppl don't get how disgusting that is. How can you foreclose anyone for 87 cents?
You must have hated Bill Clinton then? he pushed through the CRA which let anyone get a home #MortCrisis
you r just so ridiculous with your over the top rhetoric! How did you get elected! Good luck next election
meh, facts. Don't try and confuse them Senator, they don't care. They're all #PartyBeforeCountry
Don't let these snakes off the hook.
@SenOrrinHatchwarren, ur lack of class & integrity is disgusting.  Sectreas nominee deserves better than ur defamatory comments.
Problem: Spontaneous trait inference& #SleeperEffect Over time, ppl forget which was myth & which was fact.
Isn't this a bit like hiring the burglar to head your security firm? GROSS!!
if they did steal homes, why aren't they in jail pocahontas?
Orrin is Party over country! He thinks these are all great choices? What the hell is he smoking?
That's how its done here in Utah, home of the Morally Superior.
HUD rules forced him to foreclose on elderly who owed $1? Just another Trumplican who says it so it's true
Why did you flip foreclosed houses? Are you no better than an Indian giv ...     Never mind.
@GOPSenFinance AMERICANS WILL NOT TOLERATEMTHESE CROOKS!
@discjocke52 @SenOrrinHatch @POTUS idiotic tweet of day nominee
Your hapless demagoguery squanders what political capital you have. Mnuchin played by YOUR rules, Lady.
Truth doesn't matter anymore.  Even confronted with it doesn't matter.
The neighborhood where I lived was decimated by these crooks!  Get em! They are predators!
where is your proof?  We are waiting.  Will you resign if you can't show any?
IF republicans think the American people will accept these CROOKS in the cbnt they are out of their minds
wasn't even in office!!!
- Mnunchin foreclosed on widow for $0.46! He is heartless, greedy and despicable 
http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-onewest-redlining-20161115-story.html …
Orrin is losing it.
low blow. God, I feel so helpless!!!
@realDonaldTrump Giv'im Hell Sen Warren! Proud of you!
Gosh darn it Sen. Warren, stop destroying Conservative fantasies!
When dispelling a myth, better not to repeat the myth. Just state fact: "Hatch LYING trying to blame POTUS"
What? Is Hatch claiming this idiocy? Does he think we're as stupid as the people who voted for Trump?
We had to file bankruptcy to save our home.  Then had to pay all of the interest for a 30 loan in a Mod.
Senator Orrin Snatch?
Please be CONSISTENT with your greetings
@SenOrrinHatch @POTUS
Elizabeth Warren did NOT snub Betsy DeVos. You're being ridiculous & historically ignorant. My latest @heatstreet http://heatst.com/politics/warren-devos-handshake/ …
Sen. Warren... GO GIRL, Don't back down!
This guy has no credibility whatsoever
You aren't too familiar w/ finances. He has been brilliant & articulate. What do you do?
