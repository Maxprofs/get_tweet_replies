im sure the 400 million #POTUS gave to #Iran would have been a good start to fund #ZikaVirus, idiots
- They really do fear women. @ViewFromWise @SenateGOP
@SpeakerRyan will fund zika fight so long as he can smash other women's health stories
@Krystenritter @SenateGOP after all, the DNC never plays silly partisan games 
Republicans being petty, selfish and greedy.
So much for #Republicans caring about the unborn... Disgraceful
the bill is clean- funding planned parenthood has nothing to do with #Zika 
@SenWarren stop lying!
Stop blocking the zika bill and the defense bill with your ignorant filibusters. You democrat stooges are to blame.
it was the democrats that voted against the funding.
You're one to talk. By the blocking the bill you're only the same game of chicken.
LIAR, Repubs have voted twice to approve Zika funding but Dems blocked it. STOP lying to Americans
@AskTheNP @SenateGOP horseshit! Don't use the damn chemicals used...#ZikaVirus has been around for decades. @SenateMajLdr
Democrats politicized the Confederate Flag now have butt hurt because #gop politicized the Confederate flag.  
what does a god damn flag have to do with zika??!
What did a flag have to do with Charleston?
Thank you! It's ridiculous. Hold up is GOP seeing how they can line their pockets with $$ on this. Obvious. Humanity?
To hell with confederate flag. It's a piece of cloth! Zika is a disease. Repub is racist.
@puppymnkey @SenateGOP
GOP strategies like linking Zika funding bill to defunding Planned Parenthood gave us Trump's rise from the ashes @SenWarren @SenateGOP
@TurnVinyl @SenateGOP the idea is to attack zika NOT #pp and #aca
when did humanity stop mattering to GOP? To them $$$ for the few matters..not lives. Pathetic..
Clean Bill!! Clean Bill! Clean Bill! Warren is right! No time for partisan games! Lives are at stake!
Warren has got it all backwards. 

The ball is in the Democrat's court & they are shirking their responsibilities.
no, gop is adding in partisan restrictions. Dems aren't the one stopping a clean bill
maybe you should try living by your own rules before demanding the @SenateGOP do so.
MAKE a law preventing some creep from pretending to be Native American to steal minority slot at universities- NOW
Approving Zika funding while defunding the access people need for care is the worst idea Republicans have ever had.
@gjlos24 @SenateGOP The  GOP run on a Pro-fetus  platform, if this is true, they need to pass Zika funding

Fight over planned parent hood later. Zika is a disease. Stop playing games Repub. vote 4 solo bill on Zika
#zika #naled #miamibeach
- I actually agree with you on ZIKA alone.  Repubs are holding other things hostage...not right!  @bigmouthpol
completely agree...you're talking about how the Dems threw in funds for Planned Parenthood right? #hypocrite
dems obstructing
GOP knows zika created in lab and let go by dems to scare public.  Stealing more gov. funds.
please start development of artificial wombs. #ZikaVirus  isn't our only threat to healthy human babies. #healthcare
tell me you would NEVER put ZIKA Funding in jeopardy for political reasons.I don't care abt Y-I care abt Dead Babies
I guess defunding low cost preventative healthcare for women and keeping monuments to hate alive are more important.
When a Dem Congress voted in, one thing they can do is change policy for bills: one issue for each bill. #NOAddOns
Even MORE ppls lives r in eminent threat of being destroyed thanx 2 UR candidate! #DropOutHillary #BernieWon
Would you sponsor a bill to make mandatory that all future bills be clean?
Vote them all out of office! How dare they put our future at risk! #votethemout
You would let a child  be born with defects just to not offend somebody over a piece of cloth. How do you live with yourself?
You are a joke. Both sides playing politics over public health concerns. Act like a leader. You are such a disappointment.
who owns the Zika patent? We have known about Zika since 1947.Why did it become a problem suddenly? Care to enlighten?
Dirty politics, sigh

- Koch Kongress is bad for America. Kick the Kochs out of WE THE PEOPLE's GOVERNMENT.

it's on both democrats and republicans to get this done senator.  Finger pointing isn't getting anything done.
We need to vote them out or inject every single one of them with the Zika virus..hmmmm..let's do Ryan first...
I believe tho GoP wants specifically Latino communities to catch Zika that why they do nothing
Find funding from else where? Like the $50 billion oil companies received?
Oh like the Dem's don't due partisan, hmm ObamaCare, 2006-08 Dems blocked everything sitting on their thumbs! Pfffft
Better present the cost of funding a lifetime of care for a brain injured baby. And it doesn't end at age 18.
please  weigh in on #NoDAPL
Senate Democrats kill legislation to fund fight against Zika virus becuz it doesn't include their sacred cows; blame GOP. #Zika
@dremmelqueen @SenateGOP Don't let the Democrats be blamed for their need to put poison pill into the funding Zika bill.
Didn't senate Democrats block the last Zika funding legislation passed by the house?
The Republicans / Gary Cooper should stick to their guns...
It's High Noon in the US Congress over the Zika issue.

Different worldviews. Huge stakes. Stay tuned...
if Obama didn't give a random to Iran, that could have helped with funding. Dems play with people's lives.
US House debate in May about Vector Control for the Zika+ outbreak. See the video:

http://www.c-span.org/video/?410102-2/us-house-debates-energy-water-appropriations-bill&live&vod …
US Majority Whip Scalise "New bill will hit back against EPA regulations that make it harder to spray for mosquitoes".
Top Three Priorities for the Zika+ Pandemic Now: 

1- Mosquito Control

2- Diagnostics

3- Public Education
The Democrats should stop obstructing the H.R. 2577, MilCon/VA/Zika Bill.

It should pass as it is !
Republicans and science don't play together
@jamesmpope @SenateGOP People have died because GOP have tried to leverage their politics against people's lives.
Don't allow this #kratom ban to happen. #kratomsaveslives
we don't want a Confederate flag bill with Zika attached. That's what GOP is trying.
REPUBLICANS ARE VERMIN.
If you want change in America today, have China make it, have Walmart sell it, and use a debit card
@Krystenritter @SenateGOP Come on. Zika has been around forever. Why don't we figure out Lyme Disease? 6M people infected! #Money
.@SenWarren @SenateGOP Yes SenGOP U wrk & answer2 us the citizens of America.A national health hazard isnt something U dont give priority 2.
During the years of Reagan and HW Bush, I never thought the GOP could get this bad.
Republicans don't care about people
Not exactly a "pro-life" stance by the hypocrites in the @SenateGOP
neither is TPP, which ur pal Killary supports. Both parties don't serve the American ppl. Ur words mean zip, sellout!
We need a ZIKA bill. Help the folks in Fla. They don't need YOUR RIDERS. We're tired of Part Time reps - DO YOUR JOBS!
Americans voted for you to represent our interests, not your funders. Please:
NO RIDERS!
PASS A CLEAN BILL ON ZIKA!
do your job!
we the people tell you there's plenty of funding available now,reallocate funding from other programs first
When is there ever a "clean" bill?  Can you ever just do the right thing w/o looking for payback?
listen to her you good old boys, and clean up the defense spending bill as well #GOPDoYouJobs
They are not capable of being non partisan. Even when lives are at risk.
wow Lizzie ur r getting balls Too bad u did not have them when HC picked someone who's got  them U could be VPOTUS but for them
This is the most effective zika vaccine
Start handing them out
I agree Elizabeth.  Mitch McConnell has built a career on obstruction and partisanship.
PP shouldn't need tax payer money. They turn a pretty profit before they get the peoples money.
I believe it was the dems who voted no
Republicans only care about what happens to their immediate family, and even that's a crap shoot.
just no more bee killing plz
doesn't know how to pass a clean bill.
@grgken @SenateGOP  The GOP majority house is obstructing Veterans Benefits says Sec Veterans Affairs:
No riders,have a clean bill and it will pass.
The GOP will get voted out for sure with these games.
Dem Health Plan is a Socialist scam to gain control over the Peoples Med! Give us choice, Not force payments!
this Congress does nothing.
They don't care because #Zika doesn't affect them. They were already born small-minded.
they have a bill that funds it.  Vote for it or shut up.
Single issue, up or down!
@Planelady1 @SenateGOP and the GOP is blaming the Democratic stating it was the Democrats who didn't past the bill, how hypocrite
Tell that to the Democratic Senators who voted against Zika funding. Hypocrite
@khankiso @SenateGOP ICYMI what Republicans r trying to pull.
@maddow @JoyAnnReid why is the MSM not reporting this....we just want a bil to fund Zika that is not attached to pp
We insist we need a bill just about ZIKA....@SpeakerRyan do it now!
Write to Ryan re that. We need tell Reps diectly!
clean up the Zika funding bill, pass it!  Help the unborn! GOP men are vigilant about protecting the unborn, right??!?
They need a reminder of who they are working for...US!!
Yeah. Now would be a good time to pretend you work for your constituents.
just bee careful to keep it bee-friendly, pleese!
@Specneedsmom4 @SenateGOP Well neither is gun regulation but they went on vacation . Not holding my breath and all out of hope .
you're the biggest partisan that ever lived
Zika is not the problem.  Human-made larvicides are.
.@SenWarren @SenateGOP America needs to know where 1st 600 $million went & other Funds that were available-both parties guilty of doing 0
@ScottLos @SenateGOP if the dems r partisan then why didnt they vote for the GOP bill?  @SenWarren can't u put a bill both parties support?
The GOP bill is packed with hidden provisions for their agenda!
a duh, that is what partisan is, give a little, take a little, 8 votes short in june, 8 votes short today!
The constant GOP is maintaining is this: medically/economically harming the vulnerable for life; gut-punching preg girls & women.
🖒
PP makes enough $$$$ to be self supporting , get off the government teat
amen.
Didn't they go on vacation, abandoning job by ignoring  ZIKA crisis?
But let's focus on hillary's cough
PLEASE STOP the Dakota Access pipeline and the destruction of Indian sacred ground!! This MUST STOP NOW!!!!
- vote in a democratic senate ASAP...GOP OUT
Wouldn't that be nice. Republicans it could be your child or grandchildren born after their mother was bitten.
Your talking to the choir. Elizabeth i'm thinking Dems have no mediator to speak to republicans? LBJ type is needed.
Do your service!  Shame on you, you were elected to serve, not your own selfish interests.
Fighting to stop this BS
these people need to GO in this election; vote BLUE!!
Republican's playing games again

so only your party gets its way or you spoiled children pout & nothing is done. Like Obama said you lost get over it @SenateGOP
We all KNOW it was the DEMS that blocked it! You're really NOT fooling anyone!
Silly Senator, we need more sick, uneducated and poor people to "Make America Great (4 the elite) Again"
Gee I hope the prissy @SenateGOP doesnt cave to #zika like they did for 9/11 first responder health benefits.  Pansies.
Dems wouldn't recognize a 'clean' bill if it bite them on the ass!
Vengeance Belongs to the Lord they will get what they are asking for
What about her disrespect of the 'Gold-Star' families of Benghazi's valor?  They deserved more than they got !!  She's dishonest!
you bring a clean bill. All talk no substance OLE high cheek bones.
Will never happen- too many pointing too many fingers. You would rather have the issue than the funding
dems just blocked funding Liz,  might want to get your shit together and stop dressing lies
Just #dosomething I mean anything! Unless you don't care about babies? 
this is the reason we need to get rid of the GOP! This has gone on too long!!!!!
Come check out our #Zika diagnostic tool at the @wyssinstitute here in Boston!
It's inexpensive & rapid (& can be used for emerging pandemics) – http://wyss.harvard.edu/viewpressrelease/256/finding-zika-one-paper-disc-at-a-time …
Again, they are waiting for their rich backers to start up a spraying business, then the funds will be there.
I miss " Goofy Pocohontas". She is always a great source of humor and her, Tiny Tim, and Lying Hillary make a unique trio of clowns
@eflind Jeez. I thought this was something @onlxn made up.
Thank goodness Democrats never put riders on bills.
What about the heavy spraying of pesticides? Early on I heard that mentioned as a possible problem.
please vote to eliminate ALL riders on all future bills.
@SpeakerRyan Shame! Republicans are dragging their feet for partisan politics! BTW, it's the DEMOCRATIC Party. Babies!
You r playing games w/the funding! Planned Parenthood needs to be audited but not defunded. Lets unlink these issues.
Thank you @SenWarren! @SenateGOP probably believe #Zika is a hoax too! Absolutely worthless!!
Republican senators are imbeciles. #VoteThemOutNow
good idea ,, your a smart woman,, stupid to be backing Hillary though, nobody's perfect I guess
GOP DO YOUR JOB 
NONE OF YOUR FOOLISHNESS
CLEAN BILL
.@SenWarren .@SenateGOP  JohnHopkins-FSU-NIH identified inexpensivecommercially available Zika cure already exists

Well where have you been?  Get back in the game!  We need you!
the Republicans are playing games with people lives...the World needs to know the truth about this... go on @CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews
@SenateGOP generally speaking non of the above
GOP #DoYourJob
How about we stop the partisan crap & govern.
what else is in the bill since the Dems blocked it?
When we told them to read about Ebola virus, they refused, now #Zika is here

@amazon they couldn't hear with all the sand in their ears.
Do a Clean Bill stop the BS
not a plan I would advocate 4 sure but yeah that would change their focus
Why do Democrats LIE so much and TWIST the Truth.
Again Dems using any opportunity to make Repubs look bad even if ppl die. Then they blame Repubs twice.
the nation needs to hear more from you!
you haven't heard the war whoops and seen the tomahawk chop?


Pleading for republicans to engage empathy instead of politics is trying to get blood from a turnip. #noshame
Does this mean you regret your support for the Clinton White Collar Mafia?
She  has  a  black heart  but   has  a  point  Vote
