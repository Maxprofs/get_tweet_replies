hmmm?
Why did you vote for Ben Carson?
did millions of people marching around the world against trump mean nothing to you, senator?
.@supership79 @SenWarren There are Park Rangers putting up more of a fight than you, Senator. Why are you rolling over for this guy?
I wish our new administration was a sad, sick joke. Please don't stop fighting.
Disappointed.
I'm sure he looks forward to your vote confirming him.
How craven.  But par for this bunch sadly.
Let's See...THE DEMOCRATS HAVE NEVER HAD A BUDGET!!!  THEY LOVE SPENDING AND WASTING TAXPAYER DOLLARS !!!
Offensive only to people who sell snake oil and life insurance.
Are we entering the penalty phase? For four % of the population using 25% diabolical Fossil Fuels?
What the hell is going on in the GOP? THey are all acting like Nazism is fine with them, destroying USA
is he aware the protection part is for consumers? Aka registered voters? Banks don't vote sir, people do.
But voters don't make him money
you just introduced the nail to the head.
So, let me guess.  Like with Carson you're gonna fold? Grow a spine the base is angry.
Just like the "sad, sick joke" of #FATCA U peddle destroying 9M lives, U know, the "collateral damage".
Triggered! Sounds like he must be a thief or conman since he's scared of it.
speaking of wtf's with voting for Carson?
Carson is LEAST of our worries. DT is going to pollute us out of existence. Pay attention 2 the important stuff
Housing for he poor IS important.
So craven.  Why is he so afraid of accountability?
you gotta do more than talk, girl. you gotta just say NO re:DT picks. ur gonna lose all ur support.
@JohnPar54229334 @RepMickMulvaney @CFPB does this mean you'll vote "no" THIS time? 
@SenSchumer @RepMickMulvaney @CFPB don't vote for him, grow a pair, stand for something
Just 2 of the worst nominees among many - T***p Team scores again. Bet y'all do NOT object. Faith dims
So? You will roll over and vote for him anyway, like you did Ben Carson. Some Dem revolution. Useless.
She's not part of the political revolution, her and corporate dems NEED to be primaried. #choppingblock


@SenateDems Withhold consent in the Senate! Every time it is warranted, which these days is EVERY TIME! Lives depend!
@cavegirljones @RepMickMulvaney @CFPB  So in other words, "I vote Aye!"
@SenateDems @RepMickMulvaney @CFPB you will vote him thru just like the others. Get tough or shut up.
isn't that an agency that is supposed to help US as consumers?  Oh right why would he care?
His elitism is so funny! I never knew elitists could be so hilarious! He's a riot! What? Oh.
why did you vote for Ben Carson?
Well compared to the rest of his cabinet Carson is not that bad. I would hate to see who the 2nd choice would be
this is the only marginally compelling argument I've heard and it's moot
I tried lol. But really you can't reject everyone and trump still gets to pick replacement. We also have to face that they could all pass

Why did you vote yes on Carson Nomination? WE WANT TO KNOW WHY
a sad sick joke is you voting to advance Ben Carson to lead Hud. Totally unqualified. What were you thinking?
The communists leftist are all the same....Schumer, Warren, etc...
I agree with him. Thank you Rep Mulvaney.
@SenateDems I call like 50 times a day and get voice mails that are full both D.C and local offices
@SenateDems we need the Dems to step up their game. I am calling to urge Senators to oppose appointments & then Dems approve them
Ben Carson said he was unqualified and you still voted for him?
The CFPB is important for protecting consumer from predatory loans & other ripoffs.
STOP TRUMP!  I CAN'T DO IT!  YOU CAN!
.@SenWarren Ben Carson?!?! WTF? Learn from your defeats to the Tea Party - block everything! No compromises! No Ben fucking Carsons!
every time you open your mouth you are wrong... try keeping it shut! You'll be less of an embarrassment to Massachusetts!
Most native Americans find you offensive
And, you will just roll over & vote yes, anyway. Carson? Seriously?
With your help, we'd have had a president who supports CFPB-#BernieWouldaWon #CowardlySenators
Mulvaney may be sick in the head
Talk about tyrannical?
One guy, no accountability.
Fire Cordray now!!
All of Trump's picks are so sad.
you are a fraud, step down!
the elected officials have long voted freewill increases self observed gains denying their responsibility to their public
please help us.
@ceburns2003 @RepMickMulvaney @CFPB when you want to steal everything from everybody of course
Who among you (the @SenateDems) is going to vote for him regardless of these statements?
ote to block ALL! Why are you confirming these people?!
@slytwain @RepMickMulvaney @CFPB Stop voting for @realDonaldTrump appointees
I support the CFPB
BUT what's up with voting to nominate Ben Carson, Senator Warren?!?
I knew this agency would be one of the first to be attacked because it helps the little guy fight back.
keep up the good fight please we must oppose the psycho in the White House at every turn!
you'll vote for him anyway, so what does yr bloviating matter
I'm so thankful 4 u & all u do. Just reading the news exhausts me. I march, vote, donate. But what u do, wow! 
I doubt he finds it quite as offensive as any intelligent well-balanced person finds you, Madam.
Suuurrre, why protect consumers from unscrupulous company deals? Mulvaney is a sad, sick joke.
Carson is palatable. He does have morals and I think he may try to do a decent job. There are others that are much important to see go down
offensive is as offensive does.
doing the right thing by consumers & poor people has always been offensive 2 GOP/Rep!
and who will protect the consumers???? Not the republican congress.
will you vote for him when the time comes after a sincere change of heart? @RepMickMulvaney @CFPB
Good for him.
don't forget UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
Stunningly vile group of swamp things they've lined up.
Why were you "soft" on Mad Dog?
this is a lot like playing "whack-a-mole" if the moles are all rabid!
Millions of Americans think @SenWarren is a “sad, sick joke” and find her “offensive” for backing a loser and givng us @realDonaldTrump 
Sounds like the agency is doing exactly what it is supposed to do.
just as the average American finds you. Offensive.
Warren has issues with Mulvaney, he must be a good guy
we find him offense.
stop whining fake indian, and confirm. Do what your people told you to do
Great! Makes me happy.
I find that disgusting. However, I also find you voting to confirm Ben Carson as HUD equally disgusting...
OMG!!
What are democrats doing to be the checks and balances at this time?
remember 2018
Is anyone listening. These are not the words of a populist cab member. 
@CNNPolitics 
@andersoncooper
No he did NOT! Say that this is a LIE! Men have taken away all hope, join the Women Movement! @500womensci
@SenateDems @RepMickMulvaney @CFPB Progressives, republicans and the media won when HRC lost! Trump=a cause!
everything is offensive to the democrats. That's disturbing. Lock of healthy convictions.
we consumers don't feel the same way as you Representative Mulvaney....
#FreeSouthernCameroons president biya is killing English Cameroonians
nice they care so much for the little people!
Elizabeth Waren is offensive
Begging, praying you have America's back! We need you & congressional leaders to protect us!
omg
It is scary.
Having followed the history of the #CFPB I know it is not a joke. It protects consumers from bad banks.
If you vote for DeVos like you did Carson, you might as well resign because you're useless.
no to this nominee!!!
Because everybody knows sharks and mega bankers are the kindest, nicest, most caring ppl in the world.
WOW! No consumer protection! This is NOT ok. #SenateHearings
what facts is this opinion based on. Wells Fargo customers don't feel that way.
@nansmith61 @RepMickMulvaney @CFPB Lord have Mercy. #mobilize #theresistance #dumptrump
he's a tool
@SenateDems @RepMickMulvaney @CFPB It's because Republicans protect business only NOT consumers.
o but approving Ben Carson is ok?! Wtf is wrong with you! I thought you had balls but I was wrong
Mulvaney U better get it thru your thick head @CFPB is important to U.S. citizens. Your JOB is a sad, sick joke.
What are you doing to reverse trump's Gag order on Federal agencies. Do U.S. citizens have to take up arms? #War
Well, obviously its time the Dems started arming themselves against the fascist regime. We can finally agree on the need for personal arms
These are unprecedented times & require different measures. #Filibuster #Block #Impeachment #ExtendVote
@nickconfessore @RepMickMulvaney @CFPB I find him offensive
@vela_mary @RepMickMulvaney @CFPB 
You have lost much respect and 
All trust VOTING W REPUGS
The CFPB is crucial to ensure that American citizens are not financially de-frauded by banks.
#TrumpSwamp
He's awesome isn't he??
@AFSCME I find @RepMickMulvaney to be completely offensive. @CFPB is the only thing protecting us.  #jailthebankers
Good, he's right!
Wow. Go ahead and toss him down the capital steps now. Less regulation does not mean not protecting us
we are in so much trouble. Thank you for fighting the good fight. We have your back, need you badly,
why did you vote to approve Carson?
I would also like to know.
@SenSchumer @RepMickMulvaney @CFPB these pics could say anything they Will still get in  republicans have no shame !!!
Has he thought about the "little guy" recently?
Offensive? Like other kinds of law enforcement? Hello?
I agree 1000 percent. Thank you, Mr Mulvaney.
that's what you would expect from someone who wants to get rid of Social Security and Medicare.
Then, let's get him out ! Not for our country ! @SenBernie
. Another tyrant!
I'm scared Senator Warren! This whole admin is dangerous to the planet let alone the country #itsstarted
This is heartbreaking news.
Stops the Greed mongers from raping public
I find Mulvaney offensive!
We shall find Rep Mulvaney more offensive . . . #ForecloseMulvaney
White House comment line won't answer now. Instead, Send by mail poem Nasty Woman by Nina Donovan to Dictator Don. Communicate!
Go "Tea Party" on these people would steal our future and hand it to the 1%,
I know several it has helped. Not sure what drives the Reps feeling. Let me study his donor list.
Another Trump mistake. Does he even take a look at these folks? Or does he pull a name out of his hat.
@SenSchumer @RepMickMulvaney @CFPB   
This woman lied to get her position. She talks about income inequality from million$ home
Actually, his choice of words say he really has no defense to back him up.  What goes around comes around.
.@SenWarren .@RepMickMulvaney .@CFPB What is he thinking?  Every man, women and child for themselves?  What is his purpose?  CFPB Rules! TY!
We now have dozens of little robo trumps blowing things up. Don't let them reproduce
Yeah consumer protections-the horror! 
-TRUMP PICK TO LEAD AGENCY-GET IT YET? TRUMP VOTERS-FILLING GOVERN WITH BILLIONAIRES & WALL ST!
we have to fight this dictatorship, tooth and nail, we can't give an inch. you're a warrior..
 please, stay that way...
Warrior, as in 'on the warpath'?
Mulvaney is an idiot
Horrible, sad sick statement, on a cultural organization that brings pleasure and education to so many.
thought you were one of the strongest Democrats we have. Little disappointed maybe more than a little bit.
they probably promised Pocahontas Liz a new headress!!!
another soulless crook sent to fleece every last dime from the american people. We cant let them succeed
i live in Mulvaney's district and am not surprised. Your disdain for protecting your constituents is offensive
So nice to hear that Mulvaney thinks allowing banks to prey on customers is just fine.
@BarackObama rejected @SenWarren  agency's first director!!! lol

may be offensive to #predatorylending & #baitandswitch creditors. But not to consumers #Truthinlending
@SenSchumer @RepMickMulvaney @CFPB you as senator is a sad sick joke too
The man thought the great pyramids were grain silos and you still let Carson pass?
an agency that has saved a lot of good people a lot of money.
the GOP is the sad, sick joke. Dangerous and a disgrace to this country.
WTF. Seriously?  This all feels like a horrible nightmare.
@SenSherrodBrown if u can vote yes that Ben Carson is qualified for HUD I officially give up on the Democratic Party #disgusted
the Dem party won't miss you. They are loaded w I'll jackasses. R does not want u either
Sounds like Micky really likes looking at himself in the mirror.
I wonder if Rep. Mick Mulvaney owns a debt collection company?
What is @RepMickMulvaney suggesting to provide Consumer Financial Protection w/o @CFPB
why did you vote for Ben Carson? #Unqualified
A bad sick joke, like voting for Ben Carson.
this is crazy! Some independent group must watch these crooks!
.@SenWarren I think @RepMickMulvaney doesn't understand what the word "offensive" means. @CFPB
These kinds of counter agency viewpoints are pretty much getting to be job requirements to get appointed
helping consumers is sick?
@SenSchumer @RepMickMulvaney @CFPB Glad you agree. First smart thing you've said in a while.
funny enough, I find mick sad, sick and offensive like all trump repubs.
So I guess you'll vote to confirm him, right? Makes as much sense as voting to confirm Carson at HUD.
