Personnel is policy. Hiring Mnuchin & all these @GoldmanSachs execs shows @realDonaldTrump has no interest in reducing Wall St’s influence.
If Wall Street threatens to blow up the economy again, does anyone seriously expect Steve Mnuchin to tell his buddies to knock it off?
I will be voting NO on Steve Mnuchin’s confirmation for @USTreasury tonight. I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.
love that woman.  She has balls! I will be with her to the end!
believe me.  Happy I don't have ur kids w ur upbringing.  SMH
Really?? My husband served  over 30 years in the USN so you could express ur ideas.  Don't preach !
These hypocrites who voted for 45 said they couldn't trust HRC's Wall St. connections
please try not to speak as your abecedarian intellectual depth is an indictment of our edu system from you to your supporters.
he needs to be impeached
Because why?  Can any of you speak with substance?  Hey, Hillary lost. Time to move on.
No room for a branch bank.  1st loor knee deep in swamp water; 2d floor is a KGB ofc
Please don't give him any ideas.

Liar
@JJohnson2u He's in it for the power and what he can get out of being President $$. What will he have when he is Impeached? NADA
Speaking of Wall Street #fauxcahontas  ur 175,000 salary & ur net worth 15 Mil. How?
Your avatar looks depressed. Are you okay, dude?

Funny...but so sad

Feinstein is married to a billionaire wall street slum lord. Not as though your party is sitting in the cheap seats.
You are my hero. You encourage me to fight the good fight.
she's their hero?
How much $ have you accepted from big banks?
So WHAT ARE YOU DOING besides tweeting?
have you not been watching her speeches on the Senate floor? Is she not allowed any personal time?
I absolutely have been watching, & I've let @SenWarren know how much I appreciate her efforts, but we do need more action.
Agreed, but she is doing as much as she can, we need more citizen action before it's too late!
too many people have let too few people do too much of the work for too long. That's how we got Trumped
that's ok I don't care about his money he had that before he became president MAGA!!!
- or a branch ad mar-a-lago
stick it Liz! At least he's not taking bribes from them like your candidate did
This is truly "sad"
Trump can't be trusted. Impeach him!!
Maybe hopes someone will put in a good word so they'll start loaning him money again.

Still as 'nasty a woman' as before-using your words that is?

Don the Con is the SWAMP!
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, you are just another lying hypocrite liberal millionaire
You realize Trump is a lying, hypocritical conservative billionaire, right? Warren at least pretends to have standards.
Bob, isn't "pretending to have standards" another way of saying lying hypocrite.  As for Trump, he's doing what he promised.

.@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs @WhiteHouse Cool. Is that retail banking, discount window, or the WH FOMC branch (long overdue)?
no candidate in history received more Wall St. money than Hillary cankles Clinton.
Ouch, you go Senator Warren! The White House has become Trump's personal ATM machine.
but was ok when Hillary was talking to them bashing us behind closed doors
it's already open for business.
Who works for who here?
Hillary took millions from the same people, you didnt whine about that?  #shutupliz
And your 15 million. Could you explain this on your salary
#45 is the swamp
He's doing what we elected him to do. Libs are obstructing! STOP!

How about Trump dealing with national security in a public dining room?!??
Flynn is gone, now Trump should make his total tax returns public! What is hiding?
