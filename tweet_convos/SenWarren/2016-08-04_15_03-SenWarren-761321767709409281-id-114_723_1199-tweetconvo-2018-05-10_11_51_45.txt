Yeah, I miss the days when people in the GOP could talk about "global warming" as bad.
actually @HillaryClinton is helping but taking their donations and promising them tax breaks
LOL.!  @GOP Science LOL.!  Republicans don't Do Science.!  @SpeakerRyan They do Tax Cuts
Would that be, lets see..., in the pocket of Big Oil???
@bellatrova @HouseScience @exxonmobil Ask insurance companies paying out billions dealing w/its disastrous effects if it's "real"
Well, yeah, it's all about money. Truth and people's health be damned.
@tsachgilboa @HouseScience @exxonmobil Science denier Chair #lamarsmith is responsible! #christianscience
all o called credible evidence about climate change has been debunked
Where is the Science in @HouseScience ?
@SenWarren @KimAcheson @exxonmobil
How can this prevail when the DoD says that #climatechange is a threat multiplier to nat security? @CNN
- EW all that you're doing is trying to overburden, regulate and destroy Exxon Mobil -NOT on my watch!!
You can't use the terms "GOP" and "Science" in the same sentence!
the phrase "GOP-led House Science Committee" is laughable at best
Climate change is real, but part of cycle.CANNOT control cycles of planets. This myth been disproved.
and in the 70s u guys were scared to death of man made global cooling.
I guess I just can't accept the  reality of a GOP-led "House Science Committee."
We must deny what can't be proven.
I love you, Senator Warren.
The GOP is all-in on for-profit education; rewriting history, math, and now science...
-- @exxonmobil should be completely put out of business and all their executives jailed. -- @housescience @thom_hartmann
Yeah, we know. You could've helped Bernie get the message out cuz Hil don't care.
that's what happens when you let ratfckers chair committees.  Oh wait that's the Senate. Still...
Endorsing Clinton is to deny the prospect of nuclear war. Which is more dangerous?
Do you really have so much time on your hands for tweeting nonsense, Senator? Is that why we pay you?
We get it their assholes and crooks thank you for calling them out. What are we going to do now.
@Thom_Hartmann @HouseScience @exxonmobil the same ExxonMobil that Hillary takes $$ from?
Well of course they are. Sigh. What is wrong with them???
And Liz Warren is denying race/ethnicity change.
again is it not their job to help all constituents even if they are dirty stinking low lying Democraps?
climate change is a religion of liberals with no common sense but blind faith in junk science,no facts
Denial is not just a river in Egypt. It's profit motivated.
Shut up Warren you are a traitor to those who once supported you #NeverWarren
For the Love of Science when have climate change prophets ever created real jobs similar to energy ind?
It's the solutions by govt that many of us think are bonkers.
Exxon Mobile board meeting records from grandmother 1970 would you want released?
Principle of trust
GOP-led @HouseScience is an oxymoron. Those people hate or refuse to learn tons of science. #Bible
wow! People actually believe it's not true!
Typical republican BS!
That's the great thing about scientific facts, we get to choose what we believe, and we are all right.
@LOLGOP @HouseScience @exxonmobil I think it's house "science " committee
climate change is real it happened at catastrophic levels but has never & will never be "man made"
THEY ARE ALL PAID WELL TO LIE , THAT'S WHAT THEY DO BEST .
@LKrauss1 the HouseScience Committee? Isn't that an oxymoron?
but you endorsed the mother of fracking...
Senator, can u help us w Spectra pipeline? New taxes paying for fracked gas to go thru MA communities? Dangerous & short-sighted.
What's your solution Warren? Be specific.
there is climate change but I don't believe it's man made. Ever hear of ice age? Heck even kids know
and your funding terroists with 400,000,000.00
And Clinton is free both of them
That'll change when Miami is under water.
is actually one of the few oil companies that actually admits climate change is real
I worked Exxon  Exploration 81-94. Position was don't ask, don't tell - don't investigate, won't know.
Jesus Fucking Christ. How are you not vomiting from the #hypocrasy of pushing @HillaryClinton? #GoGreen
When they stop breathing I am Sure the will wake up  they can't be that stupid, really?
Anti-Science Committee
That's almost as bad as helping a candidate who has made racist comments become President. Oh wait... #SuperPredators
@LOLGOP @HouseScience @exxonmobil
Hey Genius, Show us a period when the earth's climate DID NOT change? @HouseScience @exxonmobil
They have to be stopped. Hope we see a major changes in Nov.
So much for the scientific method which drives research to uncover the facts. Hockey sticks be damned.
@AP @Salon @MariaTeresa1 @WSJ  Nice if @HBO & @Showtime together telecast “climate change doc's one night/weekend
people need to stop cutting all the trees down, thats a huge contributor to global warming
@LOLGOP @HouseScience @exxonmobil You can't call yourself a House Science Committee and be led by the GOP. #conflictofinterest
Exxon denied nothing an you know it. https://wattsupwiththat.com/2016/04/20/the-exxon-climate-papers-show-what-exxon-and-climate-science-knew-and-shared/ …  @HouseScience @exxonmobil
@TheDemocrats With @GOP & @HouseScience in the pocket of @exxonmobil & big oil, they simply can't put the American voters first.
HRCs private high tix fundraiser at the estate of a FRACKING mogul last night is denying  climate crisis too,  no?
didn't the head of that committee call science "lies from the pit of hell?" What do we expect?
GOP and science? Oxymoron.
need leaders who will move fossil fuel jobs to renewable energy & get big special interest $ out of it
Keep the pressure on Trump. Sooner, better than later, the asylum.
#nevertrump
@SenWarren @HouseScience @exxonmobil
How much of this did #DennisHastert support?
They're the faith-based @HouseScience Committee, and their faith is in @exxonmobil $$$$$$.
There obstructionism continues 2threaten the well being of current & future generations! 
Republican House is unconscionable
Try to distract from Obama paying Iran ransom.. wont work.Climate change wont kill us as fast as nukes
shut up Warren you endorsed #Fracking Hillary the #DisgustingWarPig
Climate Change is Bullsht. #Science
Please tweet to @realDonaldTrump. HIs tweets are getting boring!  
Absolutely, renewable energy takes our profits away from our big oil business. @senwarren @exxonmobil @housescience
It's my understanding that the "science" committee is run by a bunch of non-scientists. Is this true?
Shouldn't you have to believe in science to run that committee?
good employees
if we end party control of the legislature these senseless & expensive exploratory committees will end.
Keep healthy & the good work you are doing esteemed Senator Warren :)
last time I check there where Senators. Stupidity at its best
@SenWarren @HouseScience @exxonmobil
oh man do ww
So, in other words, just a normal Thursday on Capitol Hill
when u have inhofe on the comm. he knows nothing bout scrence
Why the fuck does the GOP head that committee?
Because they control the House.
