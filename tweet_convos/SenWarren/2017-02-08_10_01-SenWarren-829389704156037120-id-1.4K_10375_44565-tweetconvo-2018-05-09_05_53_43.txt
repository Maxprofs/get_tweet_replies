Republican senators silencing @SenWarren because she quoted a letter from Coretta Scott King in opposition to Jeff Sessions is outrageous.
What do you call a misogynistic racist in a suit?

@SenateMajLdr
WHY??  Because he held her accountable to the rules?  False narrative!
Warren and Sanders are heros.
They are "Heroes" to the Anti American socialist Left and to the Globalist
proud to be a member of both groups. He's not my president.
Hate to break it to you...in the real world he's your President. Get over it!
nope and he never will be. He is a racist criminal hate monger.
All Intolerant Liberal talking points. Provide evidence not just what CNN told you to think
What was it about.It would be helpful to know!
explain what she was doing to defy XIX...reading from a letter her male colleagues did too
explain...because you cant
I'm OUTRAGED @McConnellPress shut down @SenWarren reading #CorrettaScottKing's letter. Thank you @SenSanders and Sen. Warren!
if she broke a rule she needs held accountable.  #fauxchahontas
suddenly, the repubs are about enforcing archaic rules that they don't follow themselves? #hypocrisy
please explain how having that rule is archaic??  It archaic to those that feel their entitled not to follow them
CONGRATS Mr. Attorney General Sessions. Keep reading hearsay u closteted fool.
Liz, u mispeak, u could have read without ur openin commentary thatvwas 'impugning' ... nice job Bernie, plz run 2020
You are my hero. Fight on sister. Fight on.
please stop breathing so america can be better
Thank YOU, Sen. Warren, for reminding the GOP of just how unqualified Jeff Sessions is for USAG. WE SUPPORT YOU!
I watched the entire 14 hrs of his hearing. Did you? Bc all I saw were liberals politically posturing.
Sad that trolls like you miss the point.
Disgusting, actually.

@strong_sue @SenSanders  Warren tried to be clever by defaming a fellow Senator (against Senate rules) w someone else's words.
defaming or history? I oppose Sessions as his stance on civil asset forfeiture is against us.
Pls make sense if you reply to me.  Thx!
just got a little history on King's letter, wasn't a racist issue. Sorry for misunderstanding.
pocahontas!
Are going senile? It was about protocol and you know it
Fight on the good fight, Senator Warren!
Why can Udall and Sanders readCoretta Scott King's letter but Warren is silenced? Don't get it.
@SYOAKAMTAMPA

3/4 standing up for justice and democracy and #WeThePeople . I'm doing what I can, please let me know what else I
Obama should have been impeached but you couldn't do that George Soros would have outed you and your party
Why could he but not she?
BULLY !

OH PLEASE BERNIE IT WAS BECAUSE SHE WAS RUDE
U are a hater communist of all individual freedom and a big enemy of the Rule of Law in USA
2/3 Sen. Sanders, I speak for myself when I say I stand with you both. You're both heroes to me. Thank you for
McConnell is trying to gain praise from president. Remember he told him to go nuclear. Maybe shouldn't listen to DJT
Thank you all @SenateDems for Looking out for us #RESISTANCE
thanks to both of you. Could @McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr be any more childish? Muzzle a Senate colleague? Wow!
No disrespect but the letter was from long ago. Mrs. King has passed on. Please bring your own words to the meeting.
A thirty year old letter full of hateful false allegation, no facts, just political sleaze mongering at it's best.
Jeff Seasions has the votes. Get ready to loose all power 
luv it sen E W...keep on!
so now we the people count wow I thought you voted the way you wanted to after all that's how you been voting
Thank you Bernie and Elizabeth for standing strong for us!  We love you and need you!
why was Berrnie aloud to read it? Great job@Sen@Sanders
Glad you were allowed to finish but Liz, persist persist persist!!
Why wasn't rule 19 used to stop Senator Sanders from reading Coretta Scott King's letter?
Thank you both! You saved me from a dismal day following DC and TRUMP Bullshit!
WOOPS you forgot about this letter from her warning of liberal immigration policy on blacks https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/1502287/coretta1991.pdf …
you all did it to Republicans when Obama was president you passed obamacare when we clearly told you not to

TOO bad the King family doesn't agree with either of you. Alveda doesn't appreciate the RACE CARD or the EXPLOITING
why did it take a man to read it for them to listen?
No. U were silenced because u impugned a fellow Senator.
RANTS/RAVES  but never anything for veterans and military.  We are the forgotten.
Tim Scott read it too
Thank you, both!     
#thetrueamerica
Thank you @SenSanders for reading Coretta Scott King's letter on the Senate floor. It is powerfully important. https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/829357794063171584 …
True America...
THIS IS GREAT!@AlvedaCKing, niece of Dr Martin Luther King Jr, reacts to @SenWarren using Coretta Scott King letter to race-bait Sessions. 
squad goals
@LucySullivan888 @SenWarren @SenSanders Democrats  not only lost the White House, they destroyed their own party..thank you 

VIDEO: Trump Has Always Been A Racist, As This 1993 Video Shows...along with his BS "a lot of people are saying..."  
just another sound bite taken out of context. Play the entire hearing
Outrageous is US senators and @TheDemocrats who will not help @potus secure our borders. 
will you both please retire. The vast majority of us Americans don't like neither of you
Sod off Pocahontas
Isn't that known as Disparate treatment by the turtleface majldr? #ImpeachDonaldTrump  #p2 #DEMS #GOP #tpot #tlot
Keep persisting Senator Warren, right to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in 2021. You'll have my vote.
*shut!
Thank you both, for standing up for what's right.
how's the fundraising? Coretta Scott King said you used the msg wrong, it's suppose to unite. You're a disgrace!
imagine a republican using that same letter to attack obama or hillary? Liberal riots in the streets of America
take your seat
.@SenWarren @SenSanders I still don't understand why male Senators can read something that Warren got silenced for, can you please explain?
Can you vote Absentee, by proxy or by any other means? Maybe U Fake (haha) Sick & go to hospital? Call in vote?
SHUT UP Elizabeth. You shame women everywhere. Phony, liar, sham.
@GrahamBlog It's amazing that sexist Lindsay Graham was never snapped up. Wonder why he's single? Not persistent enough?
There's only one democrat more annoying than Hillary Clinton and it's Elizabeth Warren.

Thank you for all your efforts. Take care of your health. This is a marathon not a sprint!
From the Amer public...THANK YOU, Sen. Sanders, as the letter is evidence ref Session's character...
Thank you, Senator Warren, for making a stand against an unqualified nominee. I admire your courage.
Thank you both for your tireless work for us and democracy. 
#ShePersisted 
#SoMustWeAll
Don't be discouraged I stand with you.
thanks for reading it and sen sanders don't take this wrong. By why is ok for you to read and not senator warren??
I suppose you have both read this? @SenWarren @SenSanders http://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/443511/albert-turner-jr-endorses-sessions …

So you are not a fool,have a great day Senator!dora

You have Milo of @BreitbartNews saying your right to speech should not have been silenced! #LetHerSpeak
you two deserve each other!!  Two of the biggest political scum bags in a long time
I remain with you. We shall prevail
pesky award hu
As leaders you must organize this crowd & make a movement of them that will say no to racism & #makeAmericaGreatAgain
Thank you Elizabeth Warren for having the courage to stand up!  Thank you Bernie Sanders for following in her lead!
this idiot should have been silenced a Long time ago, along with other Commies like Crazy Bernie
If McConnell plans to invoke Rule 19, he should have done so last week when Senators impugned 'fake tears' Schumer
Why is he allowed?
I totally admire you.
Why Bernie, the traitor to his followers.  You are no better.  Half a dozen folks read it into the Senate record.
You are the definition of "autistic screeching"
do you thank you Pocahontas
@AnnabellSciorra @SenSanders Sen. SANDERS can show the plaque the NAACP gave Sen. Sessions as well.
not really. #WasteofTime.
and more outrageous that Senate let MEN read it! R u kidding me??? McConnell must go!!!
Thank you for standing up to Mitch Mcconnell and the completely shameless republicans in the senate!
thank you both for your continued action and standing with the majority of us that are being shafted more every day
Rule # 19 - not imposed on men. #ShePersisted Sen. Warren you are the peoples senator.
blah, blah, blah
what's outrageous is fauxcahontas trying to demonize the man who destroyed the kkk in Alabama #oldumbassbitch
you realize this is political drama. Your approval rating in your state is 44%. Maybe work on that
you are the reason we need term limits
Trump is the new Commander inchief

Please let's have a Sanders/Warren ticket in 2020!
With you both. #ShePersisted
Thank you Senator
And this just shows that women are still being discriminated against. So glad Senator Sanders was allowed to read it.
that was 30 years ago! Assuming she was correct, even KKK member, Robert Byrd, got a pass!
they are cowards.
thank you Sen. Warren for your continued bravery. Thank you for exposing the cowards for whst they are.
stay strong. America is behind you. We will take back our country from these racist, bigoted, Nazi thugs.
I guess it wouldn't have been so bad if there wasn't a bunch of DEM resistance...pretty lame...just like GOP in '08
The @GOP party isBecoming whatThey despiseThe most..an IslamicState; where women & those thatRdifferent R chastised
you can read these words from her too 
And, come 2020, let's make @SenateMajLdr a used car salesman!!
GAG HER!
how about Cornyn calling Sen Warren Little Lady!  Rude.
the GOP is fearful of powerful women. Thank you both for your dedication and service.
So when exactly do the rules apply to you @SenWarren @SenSanders
True irony.  The party of the Klan reading a letter written by the widow of a civil rights leader they had killed.
I don't get it. Why weren't Senators Udall, Brown & Sanders silenced under Rule 19?  Is there a chromosome clause?
I cant help but wonder why you were silenced and @SenSanders was allowed to read it though... #stillworktodo...
So relevant in many ways. The balance of power in being blind/impartial, rather than crony #Corruption #Stillsanders
you're the country's only way forward
weren't you warned about this behavior before?
we shall persist and we will not be silenced.
- I guess you never got to Ms. King's speech thanking Senator Sessions for the Coretta Scott King library & museum?
The Commie was just trying to distract from that smackdown Patriot Cruz gave him on OdumboCare!
#ShePersisted and so shall we all!!
it makes me sad in 2017 a man has to help a woman speak on the senate floor thank you both for standing up for us all
she just needs to be quite!
keep up the good work. We need you both
Why wasn't SS 19'd as well?
Making such accusations is not to be done in the senate.  Save that for elsewhere.
Silence ANYONE after Sleepless shat a faux-massacre hither and yon?! We smelleth thy bullshit, Repubs. #ShePersisted
You are a national treasure. Thank you for having our backs.
While I'm glad the DEMs stood together, that men had to defend a silenced woman in the first place  just burns...
You both ROCK.  We're behind you 100%
