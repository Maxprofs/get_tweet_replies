Thanks for doing a such a great job as a senator.  You make me wanna move to Massachusetts #FeelTheBern
@YouTube way to go Elizabeth!!
I saw every bit of it, and it was a masterful cross examination -- great!
Buffett owns 10% Wells Fargo n is a @hillaryclinton  superfan. pressure on him to drop Stumpf helps
Thank you @senwarren! pillaging by @wellsfargo et.al. w/no consequences fuels citizens' ire of double standard in how laws are enforced
@andrewrsorkin @gmorgenson Stumpf=2 rich2jail. He epitomizes the reason Trump even got a 2nd look!! Unequal justice.
@YouTube #BernieOrBust
thank you for being a decent person. I wondered why I had so many ghost accounts w/ @WellsFargo. do we get any of the 185mil?
email the lawyer and join the lawsuit
what lawyer? or email
Mike Feuer mike.n.feuer@lacity.org
 thanks
@YouTube yikes! I have to agree the SEC needs to do a deeper dive, wow 200m profit by pumping up the price
Keep fighting the good fight Sen. Warren! Stumpf should be fired. Period.
saw it, loved it and saw he resigned! Great job. Someday, President Warren. Thank you.
@YouTube nice call out E. W. , fuck that tool
@YouTube but what r u going to do for punishment and so this won't happen again.oh wait.u support @HillaryClinton 
thank you, Senator, for being the voice of justice & the voice of the ppl. Run for president?! :) @WellsFargo simply disgusting.
god I love you Senator. Now let's send the CEO to jail
Thank you Elizabeth! You are MY Senator! My SC $ went to your campaign, and will again! THANK YOU!!!!
.Thank you, @SenWarren, for posing tough questions to @WellsFargo CEO. We watched on @CSPAN today.
Man... I want to be in the universe where the primaries went differently. Bernie & Warren would TEAR. IT. UP!!
John Stampf & his ilk prove once again that democracies have legal systems, not justice systems.
GRILL THAT ASS
@HeyCameraguy @WellsFargo Why do political people call tax paying citizens names? You do get paid by his tax money right?
I am a republican,but i like your questions
Senator Warren you are basically my idol. Who is that guy behind you that looks so uncomfortable? Get rid of him!
Even good customers were encouraged to open unneeded products by Employees.  Far exceeds the bogus accounts opened.
I did watch this on TV, you gave him hell which he so deserved and he did resign, good going Lady!
Thank you, Senator Warren! Please keep fighting the good fight!
You were, as Tony the Tiger would say, Terrrrific!!!!!
@Koster4Missouri re My 2013 CP Case in limbo w your office; @FHFA OIG; @HUDgov OIG; "@SenWarren re #WellsFargoScams
Go Senator Warren!
@ksecus I saw it n you rule
@YouTube thank you Senator Warren for representing the people! #wellsfargoScandal
Oh Senator Warren, I love you so much! Thank you for doing your job!!!!! THAT. WAS. AMAZING. YES!!!!!!!!
Thank you Senator Warren. Don't stop!
@elizabethforma put the hammer down on Stumpf. Shame on all of them.
Excellent leadership.
shaming the shameless is pointless. Just makes you feel proud of yourself
great theater but what's the point? Is he going to #jail?  No. Is anyone? Doubt it. #whitecrime

looks like a librarian, fights like a pit bull. Give em hell Senator.
Thank you for asking the tough questions, it's about time someone did.
Senator Warren, you are my hero.
This guy is PATHETIC... and should be in JAIL and give back the MILLIONS of compensation he and his managers took
More then one Exec involved equals conspiracy. That is good enough to bring in the RICO Act.
Thank you @SenWarren I'm sure there are many many people who will be deeply grateful to you for doing what they dearly wish they could do
@YouTube Gotta love her!  Thank you Senator Warren.  One of my favorite heroes.
.@SenWarren @WellsFargo - Your questioning of #JohnStumpf should be required viewing for everyone in financial services management training
.@SenWarren So where are the criminal referrals? With the reams pages of Bank Regs, Sarbanes Oxley and Dodd Frank, no laws were broken?
That was a tour de force. Almost felt pity for the man.
I was fired in retaliation of reporting fraud to WF ethics, I have physical proof of fake accounts in Virginia
@DianeRavitch @WellsFargo Will true accountability for this scammer actually happen? Public humiliation isn't sufficient
You are SILENT about Hillary's $$$ from Wells Fargo. Hypocrite.
This is cosmetic leadership. You are so fake. Tough talk while failing to lead. You had a chance & chose to sell out
So when Bernie was saying the same thing in the primary...where were U? U supported the candidate who is bought by these bankers
It's weird that your so upset with these bankers. Since your fully supporting HRC who is in bed with these same bankers.
Is it appropriate to investigate the CFPB for $600M budget and missing this?
What happened to the  R.I.C.O. act? Why doesn't it apply to the Dons of Wells Fargo? Wall Street Dons?
Magnificent, @senwarren.
In addition the fine was rediculously low for what they did. They make that much in profit in less than a week!
He also needs to be asked why the woman in charge of that division can retire with $125M in blood money.
Elizabeth Warren, you are a champion! I am beyond impressed by the way your did your homework and handled this!
you are a wonderful human
Where were you when the questioning on @HillaryClinton was going on? #Hypocracy
Love this woman
@efgbricklayer SenWarren says it how it is! Makes UK Gov TSCommitte look like amateurs!
@DianeRavitch @WellsFargo @YouTube Keep the pressure on.  Imagine what you can do if the Democrats regain the Senate .
@DianeRavitch @WellsFargo *We need abt 100+ SenatorElizabethWarrens to make a small dent in AmericanGreed & Corruption!
RESPECT
tough love will make you better
If it would have been HRC "loony liz" would have been screaming this exact quote at the questiioners.
He was not gutless he was taking care of his bank account.  low level workers are viewed as fungible items not people
Warren needs to lock this goon up.

just found out who you are, but I'm already a fan
Déjà vu #financialcrisis? @SenWarren questions @WellsFargo CEO John Stumpf on his gutless leadership! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJhkX74D10M …”
How can you condemn Wells Fargo and then turn around and support Hillary with a straight face?
@YouTube best roast ever!!
Shame  on @WellsFargo  and not just for latest behavior. Thanks @SenWarren for taking them to task. Hope ur message gets heard.
Learned by example from the professionals in our corrupt govt.CLEAN YOUR OWN FILTHY, CORRUPT HOUSE FIRST.
GREAT JOB on @WellsFargo @elizabethforma - Now go off on #CRIMINAL @HillaryClinton https://www.facebook.com/DSouzaDinesh/videos/vb.216709768355686/1483769008316416/?type=2&theater …
T Y Sen Warren, you put the blame for defrauding customers directly on Mr Stumpf-who should be criminally prosecuted!
Great work @SenWarren The question still remains: how much will @WellsFargo have to pay back to customers & pay in fines?
- Thank you SenWarren for calling these cheats out!  Everyone with accounts @WellsFargo should move their money elsewhere!
Wells Fargo has been great to me!
A lying crooked senator lecturing a lying crooked CEO.
@YouTube lock him up
Thank you Sen. Warren!
@YouTube You have to run for #POTUS in 2020! This country needs you!
@YouTube

@elizabethforma you soooo ROCK!!!!

THANK YOU!!!!!
I applaud you Senator Warren!  APPLAUD!  We need to prosecute NOW Wells before statute of limitations runs out. 
Thank you! That was amazing!
warren gut the crooked bastards they are horrible have had trouble with them since day one of their owning my loan
They just dont get it, the 96% are angry, hateful, want corporate crooks stopped, 200 M$ are u kidding me ?
agreed it doesn't cost the crooks a penny jail time is the only way to stop future episodes #jailthem
Keep on kicking assets, sister! 
so my bottom line, dont allow another 2008-lets put the bad guys in prison and take back the big money the stole.
if the employees dident know what they were doing, i say they have a bigger problem that will be presented soon.
Not only did we catch it, we're sharing it w/ our girls as an ex of what it sounds like to speak up with strength!
employees fired-what training did they have before opening accounts, know it was fraud? sign anything?
I hear you talking about "leadership" and being held "accountable" yet you dnt hold HRC accntable 4 bengahzi? Wasn't she n charge
GOOD FOR YOU S.W. strong, powerful, articulate, organized, focused, trial-prosecute the SOB,

didnt Wells Fargo give to the Clinton Foundation. Ms Warren y r u going after them when u support Hillary? @senwarren @wellsfargo
Dodd Frank has to be put in force and tweeked to make officers give up their profits from using american tax payers!
Not only should he resign and give up $ but the woman in charge of the division retired taking home $125,000,000. BAD
I saw a lot , you did a great job!!! But... #TRUMP2016
Excellent stuff senator
demand @ClintonFdn return money from WF. Or stop your preaching.
you are my hero. I wish more politicians had the courage to confront these white collared criminals like u did.
@HillaryClinton How does a suspected terrorist who draws a weapon not get killed & 2 blacks get killed
Bravo! Senator we need more of you to speak for us "little peeps". These thieves stole our money & walked away richer
Braak up the banks - all of the Dems and whoever else.  Then we will talk
Did you actually look up the info... OR did you just issue the order to look it up by some intern?  Give credit where it's due!!
That was beautiful! This is what Congress is supposed to do. Stop 200 million $ thieves, not get bribed by them.
@JeffSantosShow Great scolding. No teeth, no force of law. What’s the point? Camera time?
put that white collar criminal in prison.
Thank you for not letting him get away with avoiding the question.
Thank you @SenWarren for demanding #accountability  @WellsFargo #yougogirl
.@SenWarren You are a national treasure. Thank you.
Thank you Senator for your courage and tenacity.
Why aren't these Wells Fargo people in jail? If I made a fraudulent bank account, I'd be arrested. #whiteprivilege
@WellsFargoThx so much 4 all u do How can we give your argument the teeth it needs to MAKE THESE EXECS DO THE TIME 4 THEIR CRIME
Elizabeth for President!!! <3 :)
I, for one, recognize your hard work, dedication and courage to combat this corruption obviously condoned by WF's CEO/COTB!
@YouTube This clown needs to go to prison like today.
what a great a$$ kicking that was, we may not always agree sen Warren but that was beast: why aren't u running?
Great job
Thank you for dropping the hammer. Well done ma'am
Senator Warren, you are my hero. Dropping WF and moving to a local credit union. Go get 'em and hold them accountable
You hit the nail on the head - what penalty has Stumpf & @WellsFargo actually paid to take responsibility? You exposed their BS!!
Way to blast that creep from WF.  Hopefully, something will be done about him.
I love this so much, THANK YOU for being a voice for the average person! Shame on @WellsFargo!
Thx for daring to go where few politicians have gone before & for remembering why you were elected. #warrenSmackdown
A pot calling a kettle black? https://katysexposure.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/16-01-12-final-to-cdc-epa.pdf …
Didn't miss it. You were spectacular!
@YouTube Senator Warren you're my hero. So proud of you having the courage to stand up for what's right. God bless u!
@YouTube Will you be demanding resignation of Sec Jeh Johnson. DHS granted US citizenship to >1800 deportables.
Nice work. "Executives" like him can't be throwing "low level" employees under the bus for what occurred.
not new practices I reported this when I worked there and the people got promoted to manager instead of fired I quit!
What's Not To Love And Respect About A Woman Who Rocks The Boat? Love&Respect! GO!Elizabeth! @WellsFargo @YouTube
@MylanNews @SenWarren @WellsFargo @YouTube would you please go after #MylanCEO #HeatherBresch next
this is why you are my hero. Keep them honest Elizabeth.
Thank you.
Thank you so much, @SenWarren for your great work in the Senate. @WellsFargo needs to be held accountable.
Who made you the god over American business? Your righteous indignation over the issues at Wells comes across as dictatorial.
@YouTube 
The "squaw" speaks. But, who cares?
Love you Senator! You do your homework and then fight! Absolutely amazing!
Nice job, Senator
@YouTube and yes I'm serious about wanting to be interim Wells Fargo CEO , I can start today if required
@pvitha for your viewing pleasure!
You Go! Proud of You!
Incredible. Amazing. Whatever.
I doubt that anything will come of all this but it did entertain me for 10 minutes during lunch. #thanks
Get 'em, Elizabeth!
If what happened there is not illegal, what is? @SenWarren #JailTime for @WellsFargo There must be significant legal consequences this time.
I dream of consulting you for the most effective way to take economic action in protest against racist murders of unarmed Blacks
@YouTube I called for Stumpf's resignation a week ago on Facebook, don't let this guy continue this toxic culture
@YouTube yelling at someone is not a win. when will you pressure @WarrenBuffett to do actually do something?
@YouTube as a 20 year infuriated very knowledgeable part time teller I want to be Wells Fargo's interim CEO for 2017
She sure loves the hedge funds that back Hillary Clinton though. Hypocrite.
@YouTube Unfortunately your true colors came out when you endorced @HillaryClinton and ignored @SenSanders
@YouTube ask about the Solution button that every teller must check for cross selling during nearly every transaction
hahaha loved how you called for CEO to be fired for his actions.Minor in comparison to those of HRC, who YOU support!
You are awesome... :)
nice try, but we all know you're just as "gutless" when it matters.  #TalkIsCheap
I don't see how through all the federal laws that these CEOs / Companies get away with so much and NO jail time 
@YouTube So glad you courageously took him on. So shameful. Should be jailed.
Hoping you can call in Carrie too for her deserved slashing.
Eloquent beadown of a creep.  You spoke for every bank teller and fired employee at WFC that just did as told.
You are a national treasure 
A heart felt "Thank you!"
Where is @WarrenBuffett re: this!?  He is the biggest WFC shareholder & big supporter of @HillaryClinton His silence is deafening
Maybe if any federal worker, ever, was held accountable for failure your grandstanding would be credible.
At least Wells Fargo fired the people who faked sales to make quotas. VA workers who faked records kept jobs.
If Stumpf was to blame for what sales staff did, Obama was to blame for what VA workers did.
The sheer volume of retweets proves INTENSE PUBLIC INTEREST in FBI Comey making public statement on Wall St CEOs 
@WellsFargo
I have INTENSE INTEREST in knowing why FBI made no public statement as it did with Clinton emails. Dir. Comey must come clean.
No one will take you serious since you endorsed @HillaryClinton. Your credibility is gone. #DemExit
Absolutely Brilliant Senator -- The execs at WF need to RESIGN -- this is just the tip of the iceberg!
What is Congress doing to more strongly prosecute these SOB's like Stumpf?  Keep up the good fight!
So as a Wells Fargo customer who has lost 60% of my home's value - guessing Stumpf spent it already - what can I do?
buy a safe and use cash
Is that still legal to use cash?
@SenateBanking @WellsFargo Ask him if the rumors are true that Hillary campaign is charging poor seniors credit cards multiple x
Your questioning of the Wells Fargo CEO was brilliant and one for the history books.  Outstanding job! 
too bad you weren't this tough with your friend Hillary
Thank u sooooo much @SenWarren !
If you missed my questions for @WellsFargo CEO John Stumpf on his gutless leadership earlier today, take a look. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJhkX74D10M …
would take you more seriously if you had actually endorsed the candidate taking on Wall Street not taking $ from Wall Street
Big deal!  More Grand Standing via Warren.
I was very impressed with you and felt like finally somebody is doing something about this problem
