@SenateDems @KamalaHarris counting on you all to fight for sanity, acceptance, love and peace in these terrifying times
Good luck to you both
@SenateDems @KamalaHarris please fight to keep Paul Ryan from gutting our Medicare and cuts to our SS that we paid into

Does our legal system convict someone on the word of someone without corroborating evidence lawmaker Warren?
That quote about Steve Bannon not wanting kids 2go2 school w/Jews. Do you have more than one witness on that?
Yessss! @AmyErikson
@georgesoros 
It is the voice of the people you need to obey! Not the will of what you want! Government upholds our rights!
