@GrapeBelt @WellsFargo and the CEO and  Sec. At Wells Fargo will,once again escape Jail were they belong
Yep. The peons suffer and the big fish swim free. The board should be penalized for allowing this to go on.
like the board and execs didn't c date this culture.  Well how the hell did it start.  Big bonus around
All that hot air from you and you still back HRC.  What about her accountability?
@lheinkel & why again doesn't congress pay social security tax? Why r u exempt from Obamacare?#MAGA #PJNET #Democrats
I thought when one took responsibility then one resigned.
Right on Senator. Grateful for your dedication to leveling the playing field for all Americans.
Be like gov officials and ignore subpoenas and walk free.
Liz, tell the FUCKER @HillaryClinton to stay away from the KIDS! Hear me H? STAY AWAY!
@SuzeOrmanShow @WellsFargo Bonus programs-employees got gold, silver, bronze bonus...Called it "fishing". Employees knew.
#isREALLY @carmax #fraudster tactic... @WarrenBuffett @SEC_News @INATTYGENERAL @SenFeinstein @blackrock @FBI
@Twin1222 @WellsFargo - should punish from TOP.  Buck starts and stops there.
Who is accountable for this...

OR this "700 BILLION" TARP

Isn't that how all of them do? We, the customers, are at the bottom of the heap.
- We the people, customers, stockholders, employees etc. #accountability
This happens @ other large corporations, as well, you are protected above a certain level. Thanks for representing!

Are you talking about Hillary trying to blame the underlings who set up her email account?
RIGHT & @WellsFargo isnt the ONLY COMPNY out there who SQUEEZE their LLEmployees 2 UPSALE, so Mgrs & CEOs REAPED ALL theBonuses!
Charged a fee for an account I didn't open. Minor sav accts open 2 help friend w/ quota. Closed all & reversed fees
I agree 100%
I commend Sen Warren but why so easy on @HillaryClinton? U prob know more of what she is/has done more than us.
Hilldog blaming a video for Benghazi. You are blind
u mean like u do?#Democrats #PJNET #MAGA #TermLimits #TCOT #WakeUpAmerica #COSProject #LibDems #liberaldemocrats
I'm embarrassed to say I've been a customer of Wells Fargo for years.  This offends my sensibilities
what happened to "too big to fail? This is too bigger to fail
I have had great experiences with WellsFargo!!
Pocahontas
Sounds like he should run for a political office. You probably could introduce him show him around if he won.
Senator Warren, I admire you very much--you seem to be the only person holding these greedy CEOs accountable.
Get the execs but stop making excuses for unethical employees!
my thoughts exactly
As a former employee on their brokerage side, I can tell you the problem doesn't stop with the retail bank.
@SuzeOrmanShow 
~ rings familiar )) )) )
The Trump Effect in full view. The great corporate M.O. #FRAUD
sort of like how @POTUS administration operates...
Man That Sounds So Familiar That's What Hillary Has Done With Her Emails Her Server And Her Foundation..Crooked
the supers was the cause of the fraud using/inserting insinuation that it was ok-bonuses paid!
CEO has no answer just says I'll get back to you. Should be ashamed for firing the people at bottom.
because you all in the house and Senate give them a free pass like a permeate monopoly get out of jail free law.
Typical Republican move. Blame someone else
True for so many crappy employers in this country.
this is the wisdom the 99% have learned by being harmed trying2do right, work hard, then stand up only2 b destroyed
@SenateBanking @WellsFargo Ask him if the rumors are true that Hillary campaign is charging poor seniors credit cards multiple x
Sounds like what Hillary does. Lies.
Sadly so true.
Rule 1) for oligarchs/plutocrats: only the poor and powerless should be held accountable/responsible
Rule 2) Oligarchs/Plutocrats are entitled
With RICO & idea one cannot profit frm crime (fraud) shouldn't bonus $s be seized? Civil forfeiture laws don't apply?
: Yup. It's the SCURRILOUS @realDonaldTrump school of escaping accountability. @WellsFargo obviously went to #trumpU!
When a bank gets fined, who gets the money? #gutlessstumpf
I'm ashamed to say I use this bank for my mortgage & credit. #HellYesSen.Warren #SenWarren4POTUS #ImWrittingHerIn
saw you on CSpan today.  Keep up the good work!
Please don't ever get pissed at me.  Holy cow you were amazing.  Stunning how perfect you do this.

well? R we going to see these CEO's in jail or not?!? This is getting to b ridiculous that $$$ means more then ppl.
EXACTLY Wells Fargo cares abt neither...customers or low level employees and they NEVER have
Used fraud, exceptionally pressured"culture" to enrich themselves by 100's of millions; #MakeThemPay #NotTooBigToJail
yep, just like clinton and obama...
@ChrisMurphyCT Kind of the same thing you do to gun owners people with money have armed guards as you try and restrict our rights
A ship's Captain is responsible for going on the rocks, even if asleep when it happens.  Go get 'em, EW!
despicable behavior, but then they see our own government doing the same
Heard the bark but where is the bite?  Did you direct the DOJ, SEC, Fed to prosecute?  Did you call Buffett?,
yours is to be   1% Cherokee
Plus said CEO cannot do your freaking job to save his life.
Well said. Low level employees who can't make ends meet while the CEO takes home 18 millions + perks. Disgrace.
It seems like they follow the same playbook at the US military when it came to torture prosecutions.
So true. No different than Trump. Blame the smaller company's or the employees so you do not have to  pay them. LIARS
Sounds like a Hillary strategy; blame the staff.
Can we go back to the good old days when banking was boring.
That's how American Business operates. They call it Free Enterprise. What it is, is CORRUPT!
either WF hired 5000+ unethical people or the corporate culture forced the people to be unethical. Either way damning
Wells Fargo should be shut down. The trust the public gives these banks demands the utmost in ethical dealings.
Shut Wells Fargo down and put execs in jail.
Sounds a lot like Trump 101.
DM me I didn't work there long because of the abuse but I'd love to tell what I know.
The America people are still waiting for at least ONE prosecution from the 2008-2009 banking debacle.
Just like Hillary Clinton
news flash, bankers blame poor people...
The new American norm
is the biggest game you could ever think of all the banks are involved
