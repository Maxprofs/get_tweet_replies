A good start would be taking career politicians off the public dime, and making you earn your retirement like the rest of us.
will never happen. They are mostly lawyers who can't make it public arena so they screw the ppl from their gov't seat
How about updating the rules so they aren't written to benefit the banks, allowing them to hold your money hostage until ur 59
it's not the Banks that rule is from.  The IRS, is the one who made the rule to 59 1/2.  This is only for Qualified  $
I didn't say the banks wrote the rules. The rules benefit the banks by providing them your cash indefinitely.
it's not indefinite, you don't need to keep money with a bank, there is mutual funds, annuities to guarantee income
oh but let's forget how fucked up social security is!
tell me about it. I would love to hear your thoughts on the topic.
@GladyElizabeth until trump overturns it?
why would I have the government involved in my retirement? I already hate our system now. I can save on my own, greedy liberal!
why dont we hear more about this bill?
Thanknyou for your hard work fighting for millions of American. CA
Dems too busy with recount and hanging with there actor friends and lobbyists, NOT A Party FOR THE PEOPLE feel the Bern
I agree, but right now America has more pressing emergency! Trump is unstable, unhinged & a dire threat to our national security
YUGE threat to NatSec, but he's a threat to much much more. Anything dealing with your individual financial future.
Love you Senator Warren tell me where to sign to help your causes. LOVE from California!!!
never happen
America needs people like you to fight for them trump will not get a pass as long as you're there keep fighting .
Then have the government PAY BACK THE MONEY THEY STOLE OUT OF SOCIAL SECURITY!!! It was our money you stole......WE WANT IT BACK!
Why are you assuming that the republicans in Congress have any common sense? You should know better.
They have more than most liberal Dems. I'm not saying they are a lot better, but it is proven what the dems have none
Please try to not use the term "common sense" with anything connected to the Republican Party.
CONGRESS SHOULD BE ON TRIAL FOR BREAKING OUR COUNTRYS LAWS AGAINST ILLEGALS .THAT GOES FOR YOU TOO READ MY POST AND SEE MY VIEWS
talk is cheap.  Do your job !  Drama don't cut the mustard !
http://gofundme.com/zt-bring-happiness-to-an-angel …. Please read my daughter's story. If you can help I would be so grateful
why, so the Government can steal from that fund as well?
- Can we read this first?
How about you make public your own retirement accts & leave ours alone Go away Indian Lizzy.
yep read a good portion of the bill, which is just another bill to take control of individual rights. Say NO!
why do I feel your trying to steal money?
Cuz she is? They want more money so they can create all their losing minutia. Think about it. They are lawyer?
we need some kind of stability during these scary times.
you should pass the "one subject per bill" also
A commonsense bill to help Anmericans will never be passed by GOPhersm
Thanks, Ms Warren.
I agree
Don'r understand the need for this bill. Are citizens too stupid to manage their own finances?
Are we able to read it in its entirity first?
I'm with you!  Please make it happen.
dignity.... something you lack
She doesn't know the word? She is a mouthpiece for anything bad and she can get on MSM or MSNBC with her pathetic ideas
where is the money. Common sense we all know you don't have any Poco
The 1% that fights for the other 99%. Now it's time for the 99% to help us. Support Disabled Veterans pass H.R. 303 and 333

@SenSchumer @YouGiveMeFever7 we deserve to retire with Medicare & SS! No vouchers! Preserve R right& help those working class!
And Republicans will block euthanasia to gut the middle class making sure the insurance and hospitals can continue to lobby.
Nope the Republican health care plan will be designed to bankrupt anyone who doesn't die a quick death
We don't want your opinion, we want u out of the govt. Democrats - the party of lies, violence, actors, and socialism. NO THANKS!
@YouGiveMeFever7 
Once djt is in All our dignity is gone, anyway. Any idea how we lose him and get #HRC in?
Please, @SenWarren ?
run your two time loser again in 2020
Oh my goodness, bless your heart and  your 5 followers! Now get off my timeline and go away.
This GOP Congress is only interested in lining their own pockets. Just watching to see how many compromise the dems will do
How come there isn't a peep from you about #NoDAPL ???
what? Why don't you do something productive? Did you punch out to spew that nonsense? How about not pissing away tax$$$$
yes!  Thank you Senator Warren.
#DemocraticCoalition Sounds a good idea.  Show us the language!
you going to take a stance to help #WaterProtectors ? Or sit idly by? #NoDAPL #WheresWarren
When are you going to take action on the human rights violations occurring to the indigenous peoples in North Dakota?? #NoDAPL
yes,but also how about Democrats in the Senate stopping the gop.
tell where you stand with #NoDAPL cause right now if it isn't about that then keep quiet Elizabeth! #standingrock #FeelTheBern
Yes, I used mine to pay off my house when Bush got re-elected to avoid devastation of the impending market crash.
Can't afford the next crash Trump will cause.
where can I get a part-time job that pays 700 K any thoughts
you are cray cray
How bout stop taxing the shit out of us !!!
And you should run for President.
Must address Electoral Collage, #gerrymandering, and #voter suppression first in order to achieve progressive goals
. . . um, make that Electoral CollEge. A little ADD word-switch moment there. It gets really embarrassing when it's spoken words
they should also pass a bill that Congress must be part of the SS system with same benefits as the rest of us. Will u start this?
, how about stopping those student loans garnishments from folks social security?
when are you going to Stand with #standingrock
I admire the day light out of you
Got 2 give tax breaks 2 Rich &make working poor pay 4 just that!Will be worse with Mein Kampf Trump!
congress needs to do its job and protect America and its idiots from donald trump. You're all forcing a civil war. Brexit v2.0
hey ms Warren u seem pretty quite when it comes to pipeline protests that Obama's donors r paying 4 smdh!!!
HUMMMM.....

.
ms. Warren stay as far away from my money as possible you & gov. already got your hands  involved more than I care for
now maybe w\Trump I'll get to put more in my own pocket and save my own money without the gov. Just stop it Pocahontas
Thank  you! Big fan since seeing you on @billmaher
I always liked you, told friends and family about you, donated to you, but your silence on the issue of #StandingRock Pains me.
@elizabethforma congress should pass a bill about lying about ethnicity. SCUM BAG
@BernieSanders 
#racist #soros #sorosnazi #liar
Doubtful horrible Congress will pass anything that makes sense to majority of Americans.
These are the monies left unclaimed
Love 
you should acknowledge #NoDAPL
What about #NoDAPL?
We cant change our history were it pertains to the treatment of Native Americans But we don't have to repeat it. #NoDAPL
I don't see congress doing anything for the common man or woman. Only for the rich and powerful. They don't need retirement help.
- I wouldn't pass any bill that had more than 3 words.
Has anyone broken it to Trump that he couldn't just repeal it because he felt like it?
fine. Just tell us how to pay for it.
Please bring to the floor The Social Security Fairness Act 973 Congress Bill
what a joke.  Another agency running on taxpayer money. Thanks but no thanks.
when all of u should have been fighting the TPP! Making US businesses leave our borders. When trump proposes don't get in the way
F--- U
Congress won't do anything to protect consumers at this point. Consider CFPB de-fanged in Trump admin.
why now? Did u just wake up?
What happened to the one time payment to SS recipients?
couldn't that be done when one applies for social security, the administration could run the retiree's SSN and find matches?
Like ERISA of 1974?
Good Idea.  Why didn't the Dems pass such legislation when they controlled Congress? #Nastywomenlose  #shutupandgoaway
you are such a disgrace to our country, if I could leave CA I would because of ppl like u and HRC  don't even know how bad itis
Thanks Elizabeth!
Please speak up on #NoDAPL. With the news refusing to acknowledge its existence, it's up to us.
You should stand up and demand a recount, not work with Trump and demand that no state has the right to impede voters!

Why don't you eliminate taxes on IRAs, 401ks, 403bs, and 457s? Eliminate taxes on interest from savings account.
What will we do for you? You lost your dignity about 18 winters ago somewhere inside a longhouse.

Please advocate for a National Recount of the 2016 Election. The future of our democracy depends on Electoral integrity
Do you have to tell everyone that you have no clue how elections work? Elections are LOCAL. Recounts are LOCAL.
you must feel so proud of yourself trolling Dems, and repeatedly posting the same oppositional rhetoric.
Please make sense. Are you dismissing everything said in opposition or is your mind closed and unwilling to think for yourself?

#NoDAPL is currently a more pressing matter with people rights to the basics of life and human dignity being taken away.
then again, we should've learned by now not to expect our politicians to stick their necks out for us. Jokes on us, right?
Dignity?  They want to end Medicare and anything else they can.
while you let loose corporate thugs like Reed hastings loot 99% Pensions and savings. WHY MARY JO WHITE GANG@SEC NOT ARRESTED?
but the problem is : who are in control of  Congress,  but  keep  the spirit  burning.
pls ask @SpeakerRyan to bring #hres752 to floor to vote. #StopYulin #StopDogCatMeatTrade @RepHastingsFL
