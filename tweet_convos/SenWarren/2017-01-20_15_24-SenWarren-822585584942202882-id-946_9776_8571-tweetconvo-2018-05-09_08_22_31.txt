sorry Elizabeth, home owner ship is not a right. It should not be guaranteed by the state.
then what the fuck is our right?
Don't worry I have my copy..
after all we finance the government with tax dollars
NY state taxes are a killer, 27 years and counting.
so basically, he immediately f*cked over the majority of his voters.
Basically  they voted for him.
aren't these the same type of risky, government backed loans that took down the economy in 2008?
No Usually they go with FHA loans that younger folks use to get into their first house Been there paid that This was a dick move
I remember what happened the last the government meddled housing markets, and started backing mortgages. 

Less gov't = better
Depends. When some people say less government, too much deregulation can lead to a Wells Fargo like outcome
Deregulation under Carter, RR, and BC did great things for growth & the economy as a whole in the 80's and 90's
Based on the article, HUD isn't subsidizing high risk borrowers to lower #bailout risks in future. What's the issue?
@thecarnage07 so, actual people are effected.
Home buying isn't a basic human right in any way. #HUD shouldn't be putting taxpayers at risk.
it's better economically to slightly aid people to be homeowners thanperpetually subsidize them in section 8. It's Math
Someone relying on section 8 subsidy shouldn't be given a riskier mortgage.
that's not what I meant, though I suspect you know that. But I agree.
With interest rates so low already, if home buyers must stretch so much to buy, government shouldn't be encouraging that 2/2
it may be too interventionist for your taste& I understand that. But what do you think we should do about the lack of afford housing?
@talkin2universe @POTUS @latimes you're a liar ms runningofthemouth
it really is true. That adds more miney to banksin the loan.called pmi. Personal mortgage insurance
Trump just took $500/year from the pockets of the poor is this what makes America great again looks like?
i dont ever think i would beable to have a amercain dream of a mortage i only been for others mortgages i told daily about my comfort apt
And his banker friends get richer!
So @SenWarren why did you support Carson and approve him to head HUD? what good can come from it. And from you changing your tune so quick?
And why @SenWarren did you vote to confirm Carson?
@nananesbitt @POTUS but she confirmed his pick anyway. Shame on you Senator
Agree
Little Donald knows how to harm Americans but so far that's all he's managed to in his 1st  week in office.
@RDemoret @POTUS Obama is our greatest President.Traitor Trump is jealous of Obama, and lies to cover up his jealousy.He's small
u didn't have any problem getting secret & undisclosed $1.3 million line of credit against ur home in Mass 
@RDemoret @POTUS Traitor Trump is a small minded monster, who's a bigot and a racist. He's only interested in money for himself.
how i dont want to lose funding of it with them stealing my rights being in my eye sexual assaulting sleep in my bed ans showering all usa
@red13charlie @POTUS it's like we are all trapped in his rotting lower intestines
enjoy lol
No sweetheart he allowed retirees who saved all their LIFE to get some interest on their Savings again to LIVE!
No Sweetheart, he did it 4 HRC

Clap her up! Clap her up! #StillWithHer
President Donald Trump demonstrated a rare moment of humility by honoring the Clintons: 
well im 45 years old the federal goverment made my career victimzation of physical assult and my housing a section 8 apartment low mainteice
- buyers shouldn't pay that insurance in the 1st place! The banks should pay as they benefit. #priorities
Why did you vote Ben Carson in?
you passed this jerk through.  I voted for you but won't make that mistake again.
Breaking it down: a $500 reduction over 30 years = $15,000 per household. Thanks Trump!
problem is working fAm w little down payment Won't b able to get a loan. Many won't want to lend
main point being stuck renters w rents higher than a mortgage in many cities
.@SenWarren Yes.  Let's continue to have the federal govt encourage people to buy #housing they can't afford.  @gaynycdad @POTUS #genius
They could afford them but now they can't.
.@QueTiculate Thanks for the comment.  But is that why they were on the #FHA dole?  #housing #mortgages #RTrump @SenWarren @gaynycdad
Pick on the rich not paying their fair share, then head downwards.
.@gaynycdad Thx 4 comment!  But #Trump-ian changes in #trade & #immigration policy can raise incomes, cut need for subsidies. @QueTiculate
makes a good point. Why punch down when there far more egregious examples of rent extraction among the rich & +
powerful? Hope you're right about changes in trade policy. It would be hard to be any worse than current policy.
FHA said Friday it would roll back a cut announced just days ago under outgoing Housing and Urban Development head Julian Castro
maybe educate yourself first
lol...typical Liberal. Clueless
know what you're talking about before posting. Oh wait, you're a liberal, no clue about politics
Trump cares nothing for familes
@JayAdamsSocial @POTUS @latimes actually he just did poor people a service. Not everyone "deserves" a house. Lots of debt.
ah so the American dream is dead for those who don't "deserve" it? I see.
can't AFFORD IT. what don't you understand. You want another epic fail?
You're just harassing now, pal. You've been suspended already. You claim to be Hispanic and treat minorities like dirt.
You helped do this Senator!  Thanks!
is this what we can expect from Ben Carson!
disgraceful. But what else to expect from a Nazi organization
, & u just helped 2 confirm @RealBenCarson ur a part of the prob just like @marcorubio all posturing no spine  @POTUS @latimes
Dems made it impossible to get a simple checking account or mortgage under #FATCA Clean up your own house first.
yeah and then you support Ben Carson. Brilliant
U approved Carson and every other cabinet member! We the people will not tolerate "Republican lite"politics
But then you voted Carson in charge of the mess. I'm confused.
I really believe she's tolerating him as a concession to ensure Sessions and Devos are less likely to make it through.
I can see that as a reasonable option. In this case, it really is lesser of evil.
then why did you vote to confirm Carson? he's even less qualified for HUD than trump is for potus! 
@latimes
so why did you vote for him -because you trust him to do the right thing??????
Then why did you vote to confirm Ben Carson?
But you just said you'll back Carson.
Senator, please explain to voters why you voted yes on his cabinet appointment.
While you back Ben Carson for HUD. Really? That's the most resistance you can muster? We are disappointed, Senator.
why did you vote for Carson? I think you need to explain that decision to constituents! @POTUS
So why did you vote yes on Ben Carson? This won't fly!
AND YET YOU SOLD US OUT AND VOTED HIM IN..SHAME ON YOU. That's gonna cost you! YOU'RE ALL A SAD EXAMPLE OF OUR VOICES!
Yet you voted for Carson to go to the senate for confirmation....huh?
Then why did you vote for Carson's nomination?
And you voted YES for this clown? Elizabeth! Really?!?!
Then why the hell did you vote in support of Ben Carson?
and yet you, my Senator, voted to confirm Carson and have not spoken a word about the government gag rule on agencies.
.@SenWarren explain your vote to confirm Ben Carson
I'm still with u but very disappointed in ur vote for Carson.
And yet, you, Senator Warren, approved of Carson? WHY ARE YOU FOLDING? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
I've been asking same
If gop/tr*mp goal is to kill all the queers, I'm almost done; GI system collapsing, covered in hives, losing it.
Then stop helping his. Stop approving his nominees. Slow things down. Resist Senator. We can't stop him, you can
So why on earth did you vote for Ben Carson?
@SenWarren @POTUS
.@SenWarren and you supported his nomination. You helped contribute to these 40k people who won't get homes #factsmatter
so why support Carson confirmation?  Will we see more of the same for Trump's SCOTUS picks?  Disappointed.
And yet you support Ben Carson. Talking from both sides of your mouth doesn't suit you. SHAMEFUL.
And today you made things harder for us by voting to confirm Ben Carson to HUD.
You voted to confirm Ben Carson? You just lost credibility with Progressives. What the hell was that all about?
#fakenews ... or #alternativefacts #politicalgain = #citizenloss ya'll make me sick. @potus
Why have you chosen to confirm Ben Carson for HUD? It seems to go against everything for which you have stood. Can you explain?
Is this true? http://thehill.com/regulation/315911-warren-backs-carson-for-hud …
I read a report that you and @SenSherrodBrown voted to approve his appointment...? Is this true?
and yet you voted to confirm Carson to carry out this policy with who knows what to come. @POTUS
and yet you vote to approve Ben Carson for HUD Secretary?
disappointed you approved Ben Carson
Since you voted to confirm @RealBenCarson as HUD Sec, you better make sure he reexamines Trump's rate cut suspension.
But you approve of Carson. Sad!  Bye bye!
You voted to accept Ben Carson?  Why? Why? Why?
and you approved of Ben Carson??!!! @truthglow @POTUS
NOT ME!
no not you
And you voted to confirm CARSON? @TheDemocrats are doomed. The "resistance" has no leaders.
Your support for Carson is disappointing.  This is not what resistance looks like - be bold, take a stand against incompetence!
Can't believe how long it is taking to get the cabinet though-too much politics. #tombrady for US Senate.
Did you not vote just today to approve Ben Carson's nomination to head HUD? Do you feel he will work to fix this issue?
Yet for some inexplicable reason @SenWarren supports @POTUS's nomination of @RealBenCarson to lead HUD. As a constituent, I am disappointed.
And so now you vote to confirm Carson?! WTF?!
wait. Why did you vote to confirm Carson for HUD?
Time for all the people who voted for him to wake up. @POTUS doesn't care about you! Duh!
why did you approve him then? If you won't oppose then who will. #weneedyouonourside
Didn't you approve this guy's appointment? Why are you surprised?
I guess someone forgot their @DunkinDonuts!!
So why did you vote to confirm Carson?
how could you vote for this man as HUD secretary???
lying fake Indian supports Madonna
no actually he protected them. Mtg ins cos lose profits then no more pmi. Then what? Funny how 10 yrs ago
u attack mtg biz with no knowledge, now u attack prez for PROTECTING buyers. If $5/mo PMI is make/break, dont buy
@lmf1649 @POTUS @latimes wss that before or after it was discovered of the 360 recognized tribes in the US Uare not member of any
yes because making it easier has never resulted in a global financial crisis before
No, he made sure people who don't or can't pay a mortgage don't tank the economy again.
spotlight please on all the negetive actions that will impact ordinary americans..
And So It Begins.
Trump isn't for the American people
Trump played everyone
$42 a month? How much do u spend on cable a month? Some of u are covered in tattoos. Priorities people.
I thought @POTUS is supposed to be helping the working-class people. Once they start to piece it together they'll realize
that he was never going to help them, but just him and his cronies at the expense of his "favorite people."
liar
This is no surprise, this admin is staggeringly unqualified and ignorant.
wrong it has to be re-written
So who did that exactly? Carson hasn't been confirmed yet, right?
@maddow @chucktodd Better spend precious Net time on this issue not on the ###...speak FlyOvers language
JUST STOP!!!!
Welcome to the real estate mogul.
Elizabeth did you read the report? It clearly states HUD took this action starting before the innogeration
when is impeachment on the agenda? let's not waste time. ~the majority
I'm sure a $500 savings was the diff to owning a home and not - and if it DID, then maybe really can't afford in 1st place
I don't understand how this helps his agenda. I get how it hurts regular ppl. Is it just revenge for him?
@MichaelColyar @POTUS @latimes These folks are EVIL, GREEDY and Heartless! They're void of Humanity! SMDH
@IAmSteveHarvey@flotus
Thanks for making it extremely difficult for me to have the American Dream
#singleparent 
#WOW
#MJS
Trump knew he could count on "Hankerchief head negro Carson "to do the job!
@oliviawilde @POTUS @latimes which will have a direct effect on real estate, mortgage finance, title insurance, builders...
@klanksterok @POTUS @latimes @deplorables got it Trump supporters. He forgot u already. #suckers
All that was done at that point was 2 suspend Obama executive orders. R U  sure this does not belong to Obama!
Warren you are a homegrown terrorist. Stop robbing the simple minded of their freedom.
Shut up fake news
@jenniferrenaud4  Did ppl expect trump/Carson to work HUD to suspend FHA? Yes or no?
Hell I don't care if he cares about us middle class people as long as he opens up drilling and oil getting pumped I have a job
I believe that the constitution has been amended to allow all Americans equal rights. Men,women,black or white.
& in Philly a family of 4 who drink 3 12 oz soda/tea/juice ea/day now pay $788.40/YR more thanks to the Dem Mayor
let me ask a simple question as you did Dr. Carson. Would you have set up the COI if HRC would have won election?
not true Ben Carson has even been confirmed yet just more lies from pocahontas and her twin bernie
Stupid liar Warren.
@SenSanders why don't you present bills on the floor that trump and republicans have to address jump first you know what we need
i am sad for what Trump is doing. I want to fight for US by joining you and the USA i love
That's a good thing. I got into a loan 80-20 and couldn't afford it. But they gave it to me. We got Bailed out.
didn't Obama had 8 years to do this?!?! But it's PresidentTrump's fault?

why was this done?  This is first strike against many of the hardworking, blue collar families who voted for you?
Lie,lie,lie......you just don't get it.
are u serious!!!
TRUMSPTER DID NOT HAVE AS MANY PEOPLE ATTENDHIS BIG DAY! Boo boo TRUMPSTER!!!!
no speeches no grandstanding Impeach!!
@mcarlingoldberg @POTUS are we surprised?
@kalpenn @POTUS @latimes how about telling the truth, the article tells why!!!
thanks for electing him Liz.
Nonsense, Obama could've enacted this anytime over his 8yrs BUT he waited until he left to make it look like Trump's issue
I am proud of you &I am with you
you have enough money to give them the loan yourself. Why don't you put up or shut up sen warren? You're a fake.
mortgage insurance is a rippoff!
is it possible to overturn that
Setting ppl up for foreclosures--Mnuchin style.
Keep fighting, Senator Warren.  We are with you!
working people are tired of taking care of lazy dems!
LIZZY you TRAITOR.  This is your COUNTRY or NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
UNITED we STAND. DIVIDED we FALL.  Which one are YOU!!!
... it's impossible to teach some people how to care about others...  
@scoopnest is your phonograph needle stuck, enough already.
@Heather07191972 @POTUS @latimes taxpayers just saved money, awsome
but but he is going to make american great again.
@JetSettin101 @POTUS @latimes what happened in 2013 was a pretty good reason as to why
Winning already - not!!
tell whole story not politically motivated tweet. 0.25% rate reduction up to 500 on 200k FHA loan passed last wk
We need to educate those who voted for him. Here are the ways he will hurt the everyman he claimed he'd help!
Elizabeth Warren 2020. She's strong, tough and doesn't back down. #Warren2020
Rest easy Liz; you still have teepee to fall back on.
the true side of him is emerging!!!!
@Gaius_Publius @POTUS To think you had the chance to support Bernie when he needed it and you did nothing!!
I don't think u read it or if u did your so blind to party u can't understand it 200,000 homes r not for the poor
Crazy.  What do the (R's) want Fed Gov't for if they cut out all the assist programs & depts??
@MAHAMOSA @POTUS @latimes there he goes, looking out for the working people. Oh wait, that only benefits bankers.
@MAHAMOSA @POTUS @latimes // No surprise but just as nauseating.
you lied your way to a six figure job and won't admit it. How will you help minorities. HYPOCRITE!
so? Buying a house should be difficult. Building it isn't a cakewalk.
@oliviawilde @POTUS @latimes Bull shit. I applied for a mortgage last year. Nobody helped me.  Stop the BS.
This is so short sighted. New home owners buy stuff and stimulate the economy. Taking this away will hurt the economy.
senator Warren.  Never stop fighting for us.    I applaud you for your fight and I am a " nasty girl " too.   Love you girl.
the liberal rag TIME had cover story rejecting home ownership. Hypocrite & phony progressive speak w/forked tongue#potus45
planning another Housing financial crisis? Or Republican Immigration Policy. Or are you building pipelines? Hmm
hate this being true (he's elected, right?)
beware of cabinet a** kissers
but he protected the program from going bankruptYou are out of touch with reality I'm glad you are not my Senator
Maybe he IS looking out for people with good intention. Some people who cannot afford/poor credit, should not!
