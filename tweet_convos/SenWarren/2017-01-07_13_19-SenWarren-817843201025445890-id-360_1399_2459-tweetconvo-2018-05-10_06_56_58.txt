pot calling the kettle black
You guys need to have press conferences and inform the people about this!
.@SenWarren @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP aww fauxahantis! not desperate, determined to clean up your messes ;) sit down dems are irrelevant;)
@lafloran @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump The @OffGovEthics shouldn't rush thru certifying any  appointees. #Emoluments
that would be wrong on all fronts.
RESIST.
Nominees are invalid bc win is invalid. He's guilty of treason. Prosecute him. Stop carrying on w/process like this is normal.
11 more days, Snowflake...
Don't let them do it!!
These billionaires should work behind the scenes like Soros, eh.
Sad how Reid & @SenateGOP torched the Filibuster to speed nominees for @realDonaldTrump.

Oh, that wasn't GOP?
Hmm.
By the way GOP,  the entire world is watching your shenanigans & sees how very crooked you are. Ashamed
Do you happen to know how many of Obama's were approved on the first day?
Warren, you back Obama and Clinton's Policy of arming IS and AL Qaeda, embrace Iran deal and ransom payment. Traitor !
you guys did it 8yrs ago, so what is the difference? @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump
Investigate! The GOAL=$500 Bil deal for Alaska Oil for TrumpExxonRussia
don't think there's any doubt ....it's all abt oil & money
Elections have consequences madam. Dems can come along but get on the back of the bus
every nominee should be asked, are connections btw Trump and Russia
Stop this travesty!
American people have the right to know business conflicts of the billionaire cabinet
We approved Hillary in January 2009.  If only hindsight was 20/20!!!
You know Trump takes over in like 11 days right?
Do you know what will cure that? #TermLimits @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump
UNACCEPTABLE!
yes and it's disgusting!
Every nominee must go through same process as predecessors held to same standards
Please do your very best to not let them rush the hearings.  This is much too important.
you guys had NO PROBLEM rushing the OBAMACARE crap..DIDNT EVEN READ IT..then OPTED OUT!
Hahaha...democrats actions the past 8 years coming back to bite your asses.
So?
Slow down! You move too fast! Vet these people. #noshortcuts
What are the Democrats doing about it? It's time to get tough and stop being pushed around by the Republicans
Senate confirmation hearings...SLOW-YOUR-ROLL.
Can you imagine that??? GOP acting like Democrats? What's the world coming to? lol
The far right church have stolen the presidency, and now own their Trump puppet. 
stop them. And denounce the electorate votes as many were cast illegally. We need a senator who will
@2020fight do not allow this to happen.
Stay strong!!
This is Trump's same tactic used getting gambling license. as republican I'm disgusted
@MoireGarner @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump Do not let them get by with this. Make them go thru the vetting process!
@Rabbit2426 @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump This is not procedure.Please stop them&make them go through regulations! TY

fight fight fight! Don't back down, tell the other chicken dems too, hopefully someone will fight with you!
@Shanny_resqchi @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump 

Obstruct the bastards!
that's so they can slip something through on the American people.
@KathiNorton1 @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump Well, then stop them, Please. Where's that useless @BernieSanders?
Please dont let that happen!!
Or is your just a little slow Elizabeth
please SenWarren do all you can to stop it!
WHY?? WHAT DOES TRUMP HAVE OR PROMISED THEM? ESPECIALLY MCCONNELL.
just do ur damn job and stop blowing smoke 
They're rushing because your dragging your feet. Our new President takes office in 10 days. Quit stalling & do your job !
I agree. Dems HAVE TO START DOING SOMETHING NOW!!  Someone has to grow a spine!
stop them please!
No more of a rush than Democrats for Obama nominees. Hypocrite!
@Tommy8668 don't rush. .take a yr or 2 & STOP TRUMP
We need all those tax returns before confirmation.
so slimy. If DJT wants to drain the swamp why is he filling it up?
..hold them back senator we are counting on you ppl mak them follow the rules
How can American citizens help with this. Do we need to start flooding Representatives with calls?
, well someone has to turn around this country! Sure wasn't Obama, he made us less safe
De-MOCK-racy. More bullying by Paid-for-Pres..NO,NO & HELL No. Kremlin's kry-baby.
take your time and do not allow anyone to play you!  We know you will do the right thing!
maybe if you or @SenSanders or just ONE Sen had stood up w/House EC objections it wld b different
So what's your point... Get over it. You Lost.. Go home and play with your friends.
Trump already started to pay back Putin for his election by choosing a pro Russia cabinet. No more USA,USA, rather Russia, Russia
As long as Trump's conflicts are not clear, all supporting roles must be 100% clean.
Block every single one w/o full ethics review, or without proven quals.
Go Elizabeth
don't let @SenWarren stop the nomination  process of @realDonaldTrump mom's. We need the country working 4the ppl.
maybe you have heard but Trump is the new President and your boss
Trump shows that he knows little about world affairs and relationships to keep America safe. Why is he championing Putin's agenda
They don't complete process, their nomination hearings should be delayed until complied
When Reagan pulled that, we got Ray Donovan. He was acquitted at trial.
Like the AFA rush?
and they'll get it! Nobody cares anymore...... Country's a joke
no rush boys
keep your strength democrats!  We appreciate you!
No paperwork. No Hearing #TheResistance @IndivisibleTeam @SenSchumer @TimRyan @SenWarren @blaha_b @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump
stop them now. Conflicts of interest must be disclosed and clear to American people
Always party over principle fkr @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump
this is baiting by the GOP so that hey can play the obstruction card
Well I really hope you do your job to stop that from happening! Why don't they have to follow protocol and norm
The D's are doing everything by the book and the R's are burying the book.
Ethics hasn't cleared them yet. It's unconstitutional. Do your job and stop this crap.
.@SenWarren @SenateGOP So what can be done at your end as @SenateMajLdr's in @realDonaldTrump's pocket with his pay-for-play cab sec wife?
It's becuz @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP and @realDonaldTrump all know @OfficeGovEthics won't certify ANY of #Trump nominees
stop them!
Why not do it right??!!  What can ordinary citizens do about this ?  Are they not concerned about the potential dangers this poses?
you mean so he can do his job when he gets into office. Why do you think that's bad
Do not allow Trump to make a mockery of our system. @SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC
SLOW IT DOWN. BE THOROUGH
Read the letter OGE sent. It says Trump's team is twice as far complete as Obama's team
thats because they are all now in bed with Putin
Yeah before someone puts them all in handcuffs! #TrumpLeaks #TheResistance
#ImpeachTrump #lockhimup #treason
If I wanted 2 stay in control longer than 1 term (or to impeachment),I would not act like this. #noose
I read about that; the 11th, while DJT distracts with a press conference.  No!
told my reps No!!! Must pass ethics!
your a total tool!!!! Just loud change in a jar!!!!!
Fight them every step of the way. These people he chose are angst the dept. they are supposed to lead.
do not let them!
Get in the back seat Liawatha Warren. Your only relevant in Massachewshits anyway.
just want to do them like they did for Obama
maybe we should March on this.
Sewage backs up quickly..
If you do nothing now this will be the normal process for any future pres. Challenge
Block them!
Well for God's sake stop them!!!!
well to bad you wasnt just as concerned about hooking up with a criminal like hillary
Where are our party leaders? We feel abandoned!! Will any Dem Leader be willing to present a plan to us? How will you protect us?
Liberals castrated nationwide. Big losses nationwide. Spent 8 years idolizing new God instead of governing. reconing
oh look....fake account Trolls.
I don't understand. It's like the Rs are trying to dismantle our democracy.
this is not right. Why would the Rs want this unless they knew something was wrong.
We hear you and know what a danger he is..NOW WHAT ARE YOU FOLKS GOING TO DO  ???????
Just like no one vetted Sarah Palin and look how that turned out!
Fight Warren Fight!!!!!!
@SenWarren OBSTRUCT ALL YOU CAN! 
#TheResistance
stop this nonesense follow proper procedure
Why didn't you protest the election yesterday?
giving Russia a pass and giving the upper hand to our enemy Putin. So much for USA, USA. Trump is secretly saying Russia,Russia
Well don't let them!
What is very troubling is that Trump will be able to set the information gathering agenda by the intelligence agencies. Thereby
Dont allow.!!!!
what steps are @TheDemocrats taking to ensure @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP & @realDonaldTrump don't get away with this?
Let them and when they are in and ethics committee takes over easier to fire them
Stop them Dems , stand up for what's right !
but they're too busy to vote on Merrick Garland?
democrats did it for Obama what's the big deal why is wrong now when it was right for u
Don't let them rush the process.
we know what you are trying to do. Do not slow down the process, government has to work
Don't let them do it. Filibuster all judges. Don't confirm Sessions.
And nothing can be done to stop them. It will be an ethics-free admin.
@SenSchumer @SenateDems @Lawrence - By LAW can apptees be confirmed w/o complete ethics chk?
Let's see THE TAXES.
i am still eaiting on Trumps tax return and disclosure!
every single democrat should block any and all of Don the Cons nominees
please block the rush. Demand proper ethical scrutiny. @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump
They wouldn't stand for it. Bully politics
They Have Not completed proper paper work. NOT trumps business-this is United States!
please stop them and fight they r corrupt and have no ethics
they have to be stopped. #resist #putinspuppets #UnFit to serve
- DISGUSTINGLY SHAMEFUL
Don't let them get away with this. Resist.
This whole thing is making me sick just thinking about what is happening to our country
why the push ? Everyone is held to these standards dems repubs eveyone
They're trying 2 stuff EXTREMELY objectionable nominees down collective American throat
don't let them slide by, do the right thing
counting on you to keep them honest for all of our sakes.
Mitch will put them through without proper vetting and the Democrats will let him
THAT'S BECAUSE #ORANGEPOTUSCLOWN is a criminal and will rape America.
how is this normal! It's blatant shameless circumvention
tell them no.make sure they have given everything they are suppose to..corrupt trump
Gee, wonder why? this may be the most conflict of interest-laden cabinet in history
NOT A GOOD THING. No vetting no hearings!
not "desperately trying to rush".......it's called being efficient.
Dems need to get their big people panties in & stand their ground! Don't be bullied

Please stop them.
Then stall & stall again. Enough of shady deals in dark corners, we are tired of being pushed around. Dems must DO Something now.
The ethics reviews must be completed.We know u don't have maj. but u must get your objections on record!
stop them
corruption has a deadline to begin.  Then they're scared when they're bout 2lose seats
What can be done to stop this?
What the fuck is anybody going to do about it?!?
@LaCina52 @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump Just say no. Every Democrat needs to stand up to them, not roll over
Castrated Democrats lost right/ability to govern. Worshiped 1st Negro instead, now being punished. Fact. 
Gee, you'd almost think they had something to hide, wouldn't you?
please help us. File a law suit.
I hope not 2 years start voting these guys out. I hope he is a one term president
They shouldn't be able to
SEnd them copies of "Downfall" so they will know where this leads.
isn't that the dems playbook?
THE DEMOCRATS IN THE CONGRESS HAVE TO STAND UP & FIGHT AGAINST EVERYTHING GOP ARE DIONG WRONG ENOUGH OF BEING PUSHED AROUND FIGHT
well then fucking stop them!
scary!
Americans demand they all go through ethics before they are confirmed
@mmpadellan @Fleurdelisazure @CaptainsLog2017
Please slow it down! put a hold on these till don reveals his Tax returns!
Please Senator Warren stop them
...could there possibly be something to hide...like Trumps tax returns
.@SenWarren @fangpusskins @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump It is a very unpleasant thing to examine a turd for too long.
.@NotThreeGuns Speaking of turds.
But you just did it...now you're confusing me.
.@NotThreeGuns "Annoying delays".  To what, gutting ethics oversight watchdogs and rolling back healthcare and benefits for 10s of millions?
They are also playing diversion so Senate stops worrying about Trump emollients clause.
