Proud to read the words of #CorettaScottKing on the floor for Sens & the American people to hear. We will not be silenced. cc: @SenWarren https://twitter.com/cspan/status/829350465779417088 …
Martin would be SO proud 
Yeah, We got a showman POTUS. Back at his TV self. Fight fire with fire. Sit down,
Erudite  impressive response. You think Coretta King would want the azzole on SCOTUS?
Oooh you found a mistake. 10 points.
why did he let others read it and not stop them but stopped you? These guys are evil crazy people in the control
Mrs. Kings voice wasn't silenced, Sen Warrens pathetic attempt at using them for hateful reason's was!
sure bc every other word that comes out of don trump isn't hateful..#hypocracy
thank you for representing all of us, even those of us from states whose senators refuse to represent us.

Elizabeth Warren 2020
She's my pick!  And let's cut out the BS with the fake nominees Democrats.
@BetaDog2 @SenSherrodBrown 
She wasn't-you read the letter before they shut you down-
Who are you trying to fool?
She wasn't. You were.
Too bad you have to dig back 30 years for that letter.Firing up race relations AGAIN. DESPICABLE DEMS. Anti-US.

Neither will ALVEDA KING who finds your actions unacceptable.
#POCOCOMPLAINER
shut up
Saying it over and over and over again doesn't change the fact that you are a liar, Pocahontas.
.  #letlizspeak
Check with her relatives before you do it.  They don't agree with your interpretation.
You DO KNOW Sherrod Brown had an extramarital affair with his Secretary in the same year as Coretta's letter?
There's a right way and an arrogant way E. Which award did you win.
Thanking you for fighting for us!
like your ethnicity about 1/16th of the people wanted to hear your BS on the Senate floor...lol lol lol lol lol
yeah you will....dont worry in due time, in due time
, King WASN'T ever silenced in her letter, it was @SenWarren  MOUTH that WAS SILENCED like in elementary school! Bahaha!
we have your back, I called Bi re gards office yesterday to tell him we are awake, involved, have memory and we are watching him
All lives matter.
Our former President allowed his hometown of Chicago to become a killing field. President Trump won't!!!
You must have known that what you were doing was wicked. Shame on you. #liberalfascism is going down.
The fact others read the letter and you couldn't proves King wasn't silenced, YOU WERE.  And rightfully so.
@realDonaldTrump , Thank You for Not Being Silenced! #CorettaScottKing !!!
No you will spread every lie and half truth you can invent!!!!
she wasn't silenced in 2000 when she thanked Sen Sessions for the Rosa Parks library was she?
Sen Brown, The Dr. ML King I knew would be ashamed of you. He was a man of justice and never approved of this!
The New POTUS hopefully before 2020, may be 2018 #ElizabethWarrenForPOTUS
@SenSanders are the new hope of the american people & nightmare for #Dumb
#WHITEMALEPRIVILEGE...men have silenced women forever...#LETLIZSPEAK
her niece told you to shut up!

Nope...she won't.
Stop using the black folks as a pawn in your political games.  Even Mrs. King said stop it.
Nope and Elizabeth please keep talking that's how we won this election

coretta scott king was not silenced. Anyone can read her words. Only you were silenced.

I really wish you would silence yourself. Please realize when to stop. You're making yourself look childish.
Disgusted by what happened to u yesterday.#resist
We will read it more often to more people!
no just you
Sen Warren thank you for standing strong. Sen Brown, I knew you were a "good egg". Thank you!
Sen Warren has been silenced because first she is a woman and second she was saying the truth, GOP hates both!
No, but you were.  Grow up.
I've admired you for years, but yesterday you became my hero!
Graham: Silencing Warren was "long overdue"
Thank YOU Senator Warren. Those men fear you. I am so proud of you!
Start following the rules of the Senate.
Shameful EW is using King to further her own political agenda.
We are watching, we are behind you and we appreciate your courage!
Like our girl Michelle says, "when they go low, we go high"
I'm so proud of you! Keep up the excellent work. We stand with you every step of the way!  #Resist #LetLizSpeak
Sherrod is an ASS! People of Ohio will retire him shortly!
How come the boys got to do so?
But she was. or did i miss something?
The more they want to silence,   the more your voice will be multiplied by other people. They can't control that! Never!
You make me so proud
You did the right thing. I support you and Coretta Scott King. The truth will never be silenced.
so the women aren't allowed to read in congress?
this was not about silencing Mrs. King..  it is about you (Warren) grandstanding and not getting away with it

it's so nice to see colleagues smear other respected colleagues. Do us proud
Thank *You*!
What am I missing? Why are male Senators allowed to read but Senator Warren is not allowed. Please explain.
you are 1/32nd Cherokee embarrassment.
He wasn't trying to silence Ms. King.  He wanted to shut you up Pocahontas.  And, he did!!!  Loved it!!!

glad they shut you up. #CRAZYBITCH
#letlizspeak #ShePersists Thanks for standing up! #Resist

In the 70's the Trump organization blocked minorities from public housing he controlled what has changed?
Thank-you Senator Warren for not be silent. I stand with you, Coretta Scott and all Americans who will #resist
the beauty of it all, by now EVERYONE has heard or read CorettaScotKings letter AND @SenWarren will be next Prez
bunch of clueless nitwits whose only real private and lifelong desire is to perpetuate black serfdom Fauxahonta.
I found another 30 year old letter.  It reads, "Liz Warren is a liar and will someday fake her ancestry"
MA voters (certainly not all) sent you to Capital Hill to take on big banks not to be a civil rights champion!
@Lorileereed @SenSherrodBrown good dog
thank you Senator Warren for being an American Hero and a woman my daughter can aspire to be like
go trump
Yes  play the race  card. Am sure your  liberal terrorist  will  support you. TROLLING  FOR VOTES AND DONATIONS
Thank you!
Sit Down And Shut-Up
And thank you for looking hateful and foolish. We appreciate your help in keeping your party in the minority.
great job! THANK YOU
I want a "she persisted" t shirt on every thinking woman around the globe #ShePersisted

Thanks...you made me Stronger
You have the support of millions and our day will come.
thank you Senators
Excuse me, she WAS SILENCED! Only the beginning.
not impressed with you guys Too much hot air.
Coretta is only one individual out of 325 million with a voice too. Her right isnt major than mine.
Does @SenateMajLdr agree about #nastywomen or is this a personal vendetta?
Thank you for your courage and integrity.
@SenSanders @SenateMajLdr Happy letter was read, but why are male senators & not you allowed to read it?
you displayed "unity". Let's remind the President of his words "When America is united, America is unstoppable"
Fake Indians are not to be believed. We know who the racists ACTUALLY are. They all have a D after their name.
While I thank each man...I resent that the men are applauded, the woman silenced. Shame on the Senate. Shame!
ACLU is going to work serious overtime in this Admin. Go get em & Thank You
