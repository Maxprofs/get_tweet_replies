YOU HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING YET REPUGNANT REPUBLICANS ARE SET TO DESTROY
what are you afraid of?? The free ride is over???
@grandpa_jimbo @MikeRumbo66 @SenWarren @USTreasury
I have never had a free ride in Life so I have no clue what your saying!
-U R right!  Nothing is free no matter who tries 2 convince you otherwise!
Please stand by Rep. Lewis and boycott the inauguration! March with us instead! Trump is NOT FIT to be our president
BUT HE IS THE PRESIDENT AND YOU CAN'T CHANGE THAT, NO WAY NO HOW,
Here is the real reason for Indy Macs failure and it wasnt the nominee!

IndyMac stressed by highly leveraged mortgages and a run caused by Schumer:  https://www.occ.gov/static/news-issuances/ots/press-releases/ots-pr-2008-29.pdf …
Keep up the good work for ALL Americans Senator. You are a national treasure!! Thanks
Shame on Warren 4 picking off a dying womans house to profit 383%
Hatch is a joke
But it looks like you r the foreclosure - house flipping Queen:
The right question is to focus on TBTF banks that caused 08 crisis http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-should-deutsche-bank-repay-consumers-for-its-toxic-mortgage-mess-2017-01-17?link=MW_latest_news …
Warren yet again shows her hypocrisy
Could one of the prominent democRATS explain why #crookedhillary took the debate questions
Can U find out how many EXXON stocks are owned by Sens on the Tillerson Committee?
So proud that you're my senator! Keep up the good fight!
Tell her to boycott the inauguration and stand by Rep Lewis!
The real crooks r the TBTF banks that actually "caused" the crisis
Thank You
hoping You stand behind Rep. J Lewis to not attend #PEOPUTIN @realDonaldTrump inauguration. This was a coup!
God Bless you! I'm so proud of you. Protect our Constitution tooth and nail!
Save your BS. For years you did NOTHING to stop the outsourcing of American jobs/wealth.
Irresponsible home buyers chance to blame others.  Great government.  Are you a bonehead?
$1 bet @stevenmnuchin1 gets confirmed! or if he gets confirmed say you're not any Indian!!
warren should be concerned about sanctuary cities in Ma and federal funding they will lose

god speed
Please hold his feet to the fire.

I love that you hold people accountable.  Keep fighting the good fight!
Thank you Senator Warren for all you do. Your a real rockstar 
Yes!
the signature of @KamalaHarris is notably absent from the letter... maybe because she let OneWest off the hook for criminality?
"But @KamalaHarris 's  office, without any explanation, declined to prosecute the case"
This nominee sounds unsuitable for this position. Reminds me of Marley and Scrooge.
Senator Warren, didn't you profit personally from the real estate downturn in OK? @SenWarren @SenateDems @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury
TARP sounds like we bailed out bad investments by bankers? Who the hell do U work for?
What the hell is the Troubled Asset Relief Program?  U guys did not offer relief 2 me?
@KamalaHarris Did Ms. Harris sign? Her DA office worked on One West case? #StillSanders

please find a way to bring some sanity back to this process.
thank you senator Warren for all you do and have done for us!  #TRUMPISILLEGITIMATE

How in God's name did U ever get elected? You're the most goofy annoying loon in congress!

I have asked you to produce DNA testing to prove your an American Indian
Fight for us Sen Warren
Thank you!
if you and Bernie were the ticket we wouldn't be having this conversation.
ask him how he spent the 27 cents he got when foreclosed on that woman
These bad loans were made b4 he took office-Go after TBTF bank chiefs who actually caused '08 crisis!
Is this grounds for impeachment? If so, the process should start immediately.
WARREN, YOU WILL NEVER BE POTUS. FORGET IT. YOU ARE CORRUPT AS HILLARY.
Hillary can make millions, have 100's of conflicts of interests,etc. Corrupt hypocrites!
Let the people speak!
Good for you keep up the accountability of fraud that is happening
Please don't allow him in! Don't allow anyone of Trumps picks in except for Matis.
#getafterit
Would repubs 'ask'?  You are being too soft.
You are a basket case @SenWarren @SenateDems @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury -
keep asking for trumps taxes and the emoluments clause he needs to sell his business
thank you for being a politician who actually cares about the American people, Sen. Warren
Pick someone else! Bad Seed!

No disrespect intended Senator but this is a paperwork exercise. Sen Hatch cares less...
I have aske the good people of Massachusetts to elect a better Senator.
I sure hope some witnesses are called. This guy is a sham.
TY TY
My advice? Hold his hearing in a foreclosed home - and invite those who lost their homes!
Those who were unjustly foreclosed upon deserve to be heard!  Thank you, Sen. Warren!
you're grandstanding, highly disappointed when you voted against General Mattis' waiver!  U put party of ahead of what's right
Thank you for fighting for the people.
shall I show the Cherokee genealogist who says you have NO Cherokee ancestry? PAY BACK $$!
President Elect Trump repeatedly games the American people saying he will release his taxes. I say postpone the Inauguration until he does.

Please run for president in 2020! Give America 20/20 vision instead of tunnel vision, nearsightedness & hysterical blindness.
Warren says look at me I am causing issues so you don not look at mine! How much do you give up of your salary?
