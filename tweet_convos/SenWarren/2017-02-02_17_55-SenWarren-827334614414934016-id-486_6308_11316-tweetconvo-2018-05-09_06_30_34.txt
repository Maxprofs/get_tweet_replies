Greed. Mega billions aren't enough, need mega mega billions, the ppl #GOP works for and are Paid by.

The Time Elizabeth Warren Used Loophole to Avoid Disclosing $1.3M Line of Credit https://www.google.com/amp/freebeacon.com/politics/time-elizabeth-warren-used-loophole-avoid-disclosing-line-credit/amp/?client=safari â€¦
Not making me feel better Senator Warren. Why are you guys not blocking any of these appointees?
You lost #stopwhining America is not buying what you're trying to sell for a reason.  You are the reason!
The MOST annoying person in congress. Where do I donate to your challenger in 2018?
working against Americans best interests
Please dont let them sweep the investigation under the rug! since Trump and Comey are buddies. It smells.
exxonmobil now owns Sec of State. no stopping that train wreck.
"my business first" new philosophy and strategy in Washington. Disgraceful, shameless swamp. So much for draining.
Senator, did you know that the U.S. currently has NO ambassadors around the globe? #RESIST

United States of corruption
@iamchrisjudge @exxonmobil obviously the majority of the US Senate didn't have an issue with that! #StopWhining
