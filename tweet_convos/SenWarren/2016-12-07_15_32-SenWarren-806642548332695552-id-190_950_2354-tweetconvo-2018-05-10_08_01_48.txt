if Fed had not played w/ interest rates--we'd have NO national debt & 30yrs of growth &-no recessions from 1981
How do you figure? And where would you like them to set the interest rate?
Fed should obey the law & the law says they need to look at market rates, and keep in line with reality.
But if you think about it, there is no market rate. Or rather, without gov interfering to prop rates up, they would be zero.
Think about it: the gov has no need to sell bonds other than pushing up interest rates to FF target. W/out bond sales,
or IOER, reserve adds from deficits would push overnight rate down to zero permanently. So, zero is the "market" rate.
Fed always raises rates too high then cuts them too low trying to control an economy it cannot.
I've a lot of respect for -->>@SenWarren She's not afraid to take on big Corp'n or Majority MALE Republican @realDonaldTrump
if Fed he just let the economy grow fast at times & left funds rate between 3% % 5% all along......
why do welfare programs such as disability & survivor benefits come from 1st $1 tax with low cap?
Please link me the source of your statistics, information. Thanks! @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
every time the Fed raises rates they cause crashes & recession. rates/prices end up lower than before rate hike
Fed raised to 19% in 1980..Fed raised to 10%, cut to 3%. raised to 6.5%, cut to 1%. raised to 5.25%, cut to zero
Fed raised key rate to 9.75% in late 80s, to 6.5% before Nasdaq crash,5.25% before housing crash
Fed Reserve has a record of allowing prices to rise in bad economy but holding wages down in good
If Elizabeth Warren looked hard at the Fed Reserve prediction's & policy, she might earn respect
Trump promised that growth would pay the cost...but Warren needs to make sure the Fed doesn't cause recession
Democrats should admit that bonds possessed by "trust funds" are DEBT to the Treasury unaccounted 4
Why don't you give him a chance talk to him go to Trump Tower to work with him Wait you hate him FAKE Senator
you.must be kidding malignant narcissists don't work with others
of course he will maybe it's time for u to retire u are a do nothing Dem
MEDICARE & Medicaid help those who need it the most. Easy for rich people to cut programs that don't affect them
Oh yes, only the "rich" pay for Medicaid and Medicare...
we all pay into both; Medicare is the $ we paid already, through our paycheck a
For those of us who are lower middle class, put kids thru college, have low savings, SocSec & (1)
MEDICARE are vital to quality of life. I would be homeless without it. (2)
fat chance
Time for a strongly worded memo Senator. That'll teach those republicans not to be mendacious.
Why haven't Dems gone against the Onmibus bill that made more cuts to Medicare? They won't cover Epi pen in ER!
of course he won't  he is a malignant narcissist
Ya, and just look at how he's behaving so far... Still trust him to drain the swamp?
Trump doesn't keep any promise unless it's good for him. He is focused on profit and power competion.
ms Warren, you need to STAND DOWN
your unfounded, Illconcieved attack on PEOTUS only serve to further divide USA
There are saying in facebook that your going to make cutts in social security and Medicare from the disabled
You havent delivered on any of your promises, even if Trump does 1 thing, thats still more than you.
protect Medicare when congress has to use it. 2nd only for the peasants huh?
promised! We are going to hold him to that! STRONGER TOGETHER 
All apptmts point to destruction/control of everything and making people pay $$ they don't have. #Medicare
He's screaming he doesn't want this job. He's not wkg for the interests of Ams, but only to destroy everything.
Thank you Senator Warren got holding Tico (Toxic Comb-Over) accountable. So grateful you're my senator.
please save it for us!  Trump you promised not to touch it!  We are counting on that promise!
cutting and gutting SS and Medicare will put mammy seniors into poverty
live in fear of repubs taking it from us!  It's not an entitlement it's our money that went into it
we shouldn't have to live in fear!  We paid into SS all our working lives because we had no choice and now
seniors need it to survive and live!  We don't want to ho@back into the work force or lose our homes
please keep our SS and Medicare as promised!  Paul Ryan collected it when his dad died & saved it for collage
@SangyeH @realDonaldTrump His promises are absolutely meaningless.
Which colleagues? Fake Dem Schumer only talks abt Medicare & middle class, never the poor #p2
he doesn't keep promise senator you know that 2 things he does well lies and cons
Liz, the man is not even in office yet and you are making such accusations! You libs did not do anything like this to obama!
@Nowhere68 @realDonaldTrump His pick wants to Loot #SocialSecurity please help
@CMSeeberger @realDonaldTrump  You do not want Ms Warren after you because you're against consumers,Medicare,ACA, & SSI.
@kimmie8264 @realDonaldTrump 
Only if Putin and white supremacists say he can.
True he's got to ask his boss.
@kimmie8264 @realDonaldTrump Well Let's Look at the Evidence Elizabeth Warren he Lied 70% of the Time During Debates u know ans!

Dare u to ever 1x be *actually* unpredictable
So far-we imagine the worst thing u cld do, then U do it
Sad
@ricphd @JoyAnnReid  NO, he's not going 2 keep promises. The majority expects the Ds 2 risk everything   2 protect the country.
I'll take that as a NO. Another T'Rump the liar, lie.
we have to pass the bill first to find out what's in it.
@TheEmerald_Lady @realDonaldTrump Why don't you help those kids, instead of charging $400k for a course to listen to emptiness
No. He will not keep medicare, medicaid, Obamacare, etc. It will all become Trumpcare.
really?
she just needs to get laid
Poco we want to know when will you stop nagging? Ask your pres NOBAMA, who only gave us debt and NOBAMACare.
Good God, please go away. Trump spanked you like a yard dog and you keep trying to show relevance. #epicfail
get off of twitter and do ur job. We the people pay u to work.  Not tweet all dam day
STFU U HAG!
If he does, make sure he doesn't have his crooked fingers crossed.
Pocahontas 
And so do a lot of seniors!
HERE YOU GO HUSSEIN!  YOU GOT YOUR CONSOLATION PRIZE FROM...

WELL, YOU GUESSED IT !!!!

BRAVO !!!
.
my parents worked to hard not to get Medicare just cuz you were born with a silver spoon
I would like to know to as a taxpayer and a senior.
He also promised to protect social security. Maybe by protect he meant hand everything over to Wallstreet!!
I don't recall the Don saying he would GUT Medicare & Medicare. Maybe flushing the 95% who really don't qualify
This creep doesn't know what "promise" means 
Shut up Pocahontas!!!!
do yur colleagues want to know when u will repay the scholarship u stole from the Cherokee?
Senator you will never get a straight answer from the Great Imposter.
Shocking making sure Government programs stay strong
No, hon..he won't, his buddies won't be able to monetize it personally if he does..
, @realDonaldTrump ,sign of a civilized society is efforts made to take care of those less fortunate, elders and children. #resist
I want to know too!  I'm on Medicare and receive Social Security benefits.
lol.  It's painfully obvious where his loyalties lie... and it's not with any "promise" he made.
They are toast in tRump's administration.  May cause a war they cannot win.
he's too busy filling the swamp with the worst of the worst appointees to answer your questions.
Senator Warren, I'm pretty sure he will flip flop on this. It's his pattern, you know.
why wouldn't he keep programs that work Senator. It's your party that lies. Obama said we can keep our doctors
YES,  @realDonaldTrump , we want to know.
Please stop #ScottPruit !! We here in #Wellfleet #CapeCod are big environmental advocates..THIS GUY MUST BE STOPPED!! Thank you
he's just not that into you.
seniors receiving social security and Medicare want to know too. Will there be a living COLA in our future?
He also promised to address massive & widespread government waste, fraud and abuse. Remind your colleagues.
We all want to know!
WELL I WANT TO KNOW WHEN YOUR LIBERAL SELF SERVING ASS IS GOING TO RETIRE
I highly doubt it
Ponzi schemes go broke Senator Warren. The people to blame are those who put their faith in them to last 4ever.
i will send letters & email & call. Im in so calif so dont know who but ill call someone
@DanRodricks #FlipFlopDonny
like he's going to take care of vets, jobs, the economy, and then NOT take care of the needy? Logic people!
DT too busy worrying about SNL this Sat. DT Sad very sad and grossly incompetent #12accusersandfraudster
of course they will, how do you not already know that ?
Why don't you wait until he gets into office before you ask questions like that.
So does the people that depend on Medicare.
yes inquiring minds would like to know?
Yes, Americans want to know Donald are you going to protect Medicare and Medicaid?
Medicare and social security are self funded. Stop borrowing & invest to get bank interest = increased benefits
bring back the Fairness Doctrine or a modern version of it.... GIVE holders of broadcast licenses REWARDS FOR FACTS
do you actually expect @realDonaldTrump to honor ANY commitment hat does not benefit his family, friends or himself?
@Roberta1836 @realDonaldTrump Lady it is way past  time for you to give it up. You are NOT going to be a big deal; ever.
Trumps promises are as worthless as stock in his bankrupt casinos @realDonaldTrump
no - satan doesn't keep promises
Of course he won't. He is only in this for himself. We are all screwed!! Not A TRUMP CHUMP!!!!
"aka the great divider" only tweets at 3am check back later for tweet rant of the day he may say something then.
Lizzy yourColleagues andYou are unimportant and have become Obscure and IrrelevantYou all are done in by Hillary
MAKE ELECTION DAY "NATIONAL HOLIDAY" if you do not do it, DT will do it & look real good doing it, please listen 2 us little ones
If Trump wants to build the military and infrastructure he has to rob social programs and environmental funding
He also wants to cut taxes and we are 20 trillion in debt. How does that work out?
And so does America
that's it Senator! We need people like you! Help! We have an @&$@ going to Washington! I just don't think wllwrk
PLEASE CREATE A USA SOVEREIGNTY PROTECTION BILL if you Dem boss can't permanently protect VOTING, VOTING FAIRNESS nothing matters
Go get em. America needs a political tiger confidently addressing critical issues. Go get em! Your wonderful.
He speaks without thinking. He says whatever comes into his head. Send him a daily email with his promises.
no because he's a psychopath. Not joking or poking fun. It's scary
No that money going missing like the pentagon no medicaid or medicare republicans prefer you to die quietly
Wait and see Warren You and your colleagues LOST
I HOPE YOU DEMS ARE INVESTIGATING DT's DEEP CRIMES... you know he is a crime boss right?
Hopefully he'll gut them POCAHONTAS

Thank you 4 calling attn 2 this @SenWarren . It's too important to drop, ignore, or pretend that the changes won't happen. @realDonaldTrump
He's never going to tell you until after he creates the news bite  himself and delivers before anyone else.
Why don't you ask him face to face? As my Sen, I sent you an email and you've ignored me!!!
Calm down...geez
He hasn't even been sworn in yet !
*Shakes Magic 8 Ball*

"All signs point to no."
How will Trump play both sides of the street? Raving crazy AltRight? and moderate middle America?
No. He'll just block you on twitter
and his little midget Ryan too.
I presume that's a rhetorical question, Senator Warren. We all know the answer.
Absolutely keep your promise President Elect Trump and don't destroy Medicare please.
So do your constituents.
what about YOUR promise to #raredisease patients. Denying the OPEN Act is a death sentence for millions.  @realDonaldTrump
NO. Why bother asking.
SENATOR WARREN GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.....
OMG @realDonaldTrump never said he was getting rid of Medicare or Medicade only Obamacare, and he is keeping a few items from it
doesn't anyone or you listen. How did you get your position surely not from listening @realDonaldTrump
He will do what he is told by those around him. He does not care otherwise.
These changes would devastate seniors and low-income Americans. Republicans only want to look at bottom line and their pockets
Well done Senate Dems!  Making us proud & bringing our fight!  #WillTheRealTrumpPleaseStandUp
Please don't forget about healthcare...my life depends on it.
Trump has told so many lies that it doesn't matter what he says.  No one will believe him anyway.  Sad :-( @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
Promise? What promise?
Him? Promise? lol. All he can do is lie
Simple answer? NO. Sociopaths feel no compunction to honor promises.
we need to be saved from his insanity!!
I'd like to think that but he's such a liar, so I won't hold my breath.
didn't this Administration dig into Medicare to pay for illegals or refugees ? @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls
Did you know that before MaoCare collapsed
underpaid doctors were called
"The Barefoot Doctors"
No high school...
Can't understand how anyone still takes this fake progressive seriously, she has no spine.
how is this for not having a spine?
Simple, he did not have the spina to support Bernie, a progressive.
zip it Pocahontas
Don't hold your breathe Mrs. Warren
He is a liar so don't hold your breath
I don't think he cares what you and your colleagues want.
like how you can keep your doctor?
so U admit @realDonaldTrump lied about Medicare & Medicaid! At least that's an honest confession!
how do you conjure a lie out of what I asked? I am very curious.
Obama lied by saying u can keep ur doctor & u said Trump did the same thing with his Medicare comment!
Wrong. She implied that Medicare & Medicaid are vulnerable. I asked in reference to Obamacare
Like everyone else..... You'll have to wait.
I can answer that question: No.
I'll be auctioning a piece of art soon...I'm also choosing my cabinet...highest bid...gets the piece of art.
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
He lied about draining the swamp, so doubt it. @realDonaldTrump
Had Bernie won, he too would have worked with marginalized prog insiders who align more strongly with his views. [6]
