,Everyone shold know that they should never resist a police inquiry.
Oh, great. So where, specifically, did #PhilandoCastile resist an inquiry?
And you have independent evidence that the officer told him not to do anything prior to the video starting?
Look, you're a cop defender, I get it. For me, bc cops are given exceptional authority, I hold them to an exceptional standard
Where did I paint him or any cop with a racist brush? I'm a middle class white man and I want nothing to do with the police
@Bensvoice yeah bc liberal policies have worked so well in Chicago
It's a mental disconnect to blame the gun violence problem in Chicago on "liberal policies." That's simpleton territory.
My city has strong firearms regulations, and we keep getting safer. So it's just nonsense to say "liberal policies."
that's bc Giulani and Bloomberg cleaned up the gang violence
It's just not that simple.
are you saying if he was Asian or Hispanic he would be alive? Some cops just make dumb decisions
Who knows what might have happened? There is clearly a specific issue at hand.
when have you seen liberals tweet an Asian or Hispanic death by a cop? Where is the empirical evidence?
So, what can we do about it? Where’s the bipartisan support for body cameras and better de-escalation training?
or training for parents to teach kids when cops tell you to stop - it ain't a "choice"
Have you talked to a black parent about how they talk to their children about the police? Try that. It’s chilling.
Have black parents in Chicago talked to their children about black on black violence there as well? They should try that.
I don’t live there but I know they do here. You can criticize all you want, but you’re not helping anyone. What’s your goal?
there was no criticism - facts are facts.  The goal is respect for all - and especially for society and the police who protect us
I respect law enforcement, but I also want reforms. Those two things can coexist.
#BlacklivesMatter Black Parents just need teach kids to RESPECT THE LAW - DONT DO ANY CRIME and you will be respected BY the law
Funny my Black children are not a drain if police but are afraid of criminals who don't care for laws like Clintons
And yesterday I spoke with a white MA State Trooper, and his 7 year old said to him "Daddy please don't go get killed today."
Teach kids not to resist arrest.
Stop your ranting!
Too many blacks resent authority and bring police to conflicts; they get arrested for "resisting arrest."  Respect gets respect.
Houston is the armed robbery capital of the  USA. 98%n of USA robberys are black males. #EndBlackTerrorism
- Easy fix.  Stop race-baiting, and let's get together in a formal session to see what each side needs to do to get along!
@RealDonaldTrump @SeanHannity
#GoofyElizabethWarren:  We cant ignore ugly kids
http://www.RalphCorbett.com 
@Monishe1She Who damn cares. Don't commit a crime and there won't be any problems.
what"s your message to white folks who are afraid to go to a mall shopping who fear they may be attacked by black punks in gangs?
Has that been your personal experience, you're afraid to go to the mall? #SillyThingsToBeMadAbout #DemsInPhilly
Not afraid to go to mall, nervous. I am licenced to carry. I will shoot anyone who puts me or my family in danger! Not what i want
@SenWarren
Are you out of your mind? I'm surprised Harvard gave you a spot. How about the parents teach their snowflakes to follow the law.
we can't ignore the ugly truth that many black parents aren't teaching their kids how to obey the laws and work towards success!
Black Lives Murder --- Don't they?  They kill cops.  They chant things like "Pigs in blanket frying like bacon".
Here is an example, please, please watch and RT heavily. This is on Pence's watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQgphFafMCk … #blacklivesmatter
yet this prog ignores  black professor at her univ just completed  massive study shows whites 20% more likely 2 be shot in a stop
bullshit
Parents should not be teaching disrespect for authority.
What black parents need to do is teach their children not to resist arrest.
If they didn't break the law, they wouldn't have to be terrified.
Obama Dems don't want to discuss the carnage in Chicago black on black crime and gangs.
then stop making more laws with govt, giving them an opportunity to pull the over/arrest
black parents?  Patents?  For 70% of blacks its singular...Parent.  Fix the family problem and the crime part fixes itself
at least the parents of black children are teaching them something
@pmurph321 What about Latino parents? #LatinoLivesMatter
well if they keep showing disrespect and not work together we won't have any police what's wrong with that picture hypocrite
What do they teach them about servicing inner city violence #Chiraq
Black people are afraid of water and dogs too but that doesn't mean every irrational fear should be coddled.
I don't know what black parents you know, but the ones I know simply teach their kids to be responsible citizens like we all do
they should teach their kids to not break the law and to follow orders when given. Try that.
how about they teach their children to respect the Police???
True. Undeniable most American blacks, being leftists, are taught racism & hatred of local authority there to protect
Right. Because cops treat blacks with respect
Collectivist generalizing of completely different individuals in 50 different states & countless municipalities.  @SenWarren
it should be called "black lives matter, too"
@SholaOlatoye delete your account with this race baiting BS

We CAN ignore plastic rebels and #Sellout politicians https://goo.gl/nIOG7I  #ZeroSec #ZeroSellOuts
Ugly reality is the DNC are Republicans with a big unity smile. #ZeroSec #ZeroRepublic
Karma is coming to them and to your sellout doublespeak. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFhAUeGgLmM&feature=youtu.be … #ZeroSec #ZeroSellOuts
We hunt ugly realities. Like Zionistic murderous corporate politicans. #ZeroSec #ZeroRepresentation
Absolutely right
you could help with the drafting of the "new" "super predator" bill.
16 Police Officers have been shot by black people in the last 2 days.
@Catballou It's  real reality. We are just trying to keep our Sons and Daughters a live.
Perhaps they can teach them to drop their guns and be polite
Teach the little shits to be courteous and compliant when approached by officers. Then there will be no reason to be afraid.
ass
Stop dividing the country into your neat little boxes. It's not helping. Work on unifying the country!
Parents of gay kids are afraid that teaching kids to survive Muslims won't be enough!!
Shut up. You wouldn't be caught dead walking around a black neighborhood at night. You are the worst hypocrite in public life.
@HillaryClinton said to stop vilifying the police
So are white parents.
Most people still can't get over the fact you lied about ancestry to get ahead & steal a college applicant spot from a true PoC.
youre just a pandering hack it's pathetic
hmm *likely* does that seem ok. *Likely*
How did you get elected?? What planet are you from?
hi Iam @SenWarren I know what black people want and how they think. I saw the Cosby show. And I watched roots. #ShutUp
you and @HillaryClinton are the problem. Put ur $ were you mouth is. Give all ur $ to blacks. Then open ur trap. #traitor #crook
You seem pretty good at ignoring this reality  http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/07/08/black-lives-matter-supporters-celebrate-police-deaths-twitter/ …
How far from the 'hood do you live anyway? You're truly clueless. Cops r terrified to go to work dingbat
As a Native American, do you really have the background to speak for 'black parents'?
that's not reality - that's delusion and full scale pandering. Black parents I know don't think that way.
you are just pandering for votes, which is disgusting
Unfortunately, pandering ALWAYS WORKS!!!!
Democrats have controlled & are responsible for conditions in Detroit, Chicago, St Louis. Wherever there's poverty there are Dems
Here's what Alton Sterling was teaching his children.#ThinBlueLine #LEOLivesMATTER
@littelilydo What's really sick is that it is 2016 & this crap is still going on! It is terrifying people have 2 live this way!
@MariusLecter Part of the prblm is black teach kids to be scared. Then they don't listen when stopped and gets them killed
I think you mean "parent," not "parents." Many of them have mothers but are without fathers.
@oshua_5 @SurlyPoet CHEESE & RICE! Pocahontas doesn't understand that you need to teach your children to be honest & obey the law
@jorgeramosnews start with respect
Why don't black parents just teach their kids to be honest and law abiding? No need to 'survive' police then. #moron
Frankly, so am I
Thank you, Senator Warren! I can only appreciate you at least shining light on an issue we deal with everyday .
My son, Eagle Scout and College Student is afraid.  This is NOT as it should be.
then do something! @FeelHood
What would you suggest for her..?
she can start with making it part of the daily national conversation
It isn't already...?
why teach to survive? Teach to listen, respect, appreciate, and watch how things change. Survival school is the military.
and as an elected offices what are you doing. Composing a tweet
what planet were you an Indian on ?
If you have to teach your kid how to survive encounters with the police, what kind of a state do we live in? #blacklivesmatter
get your head out of your ass!!
That's why Trump has to win so we have real change, blue lives matter.
all lives matter
right now, white parents are terrified and worry about their kids surviving world war 3 of president Killary
You encouraged them Warren, what do you have to say now? Your enticing Blacks to be afraid of Police helped kill 5 last night!
Attitude Reflect Leadership. Everyone of u Liberal Hacks have the Blood of these DEAD Officers on ur hands
this tweet is racist. We should be teaching all children respect and maybe this world would straighten out. But you want to label
Waiting patiently for your thoughts on #DallasPoliceShooting. Waiting.
#Fear the #Police, #fear the #taxMan, #fear the #news, #fear tomorrow. any other mind control to throw in #FakeNews? #IsReal
Respectfully, shouldn't the families of law enforcement be given the same consideration?
oh shut up.  You are the problem
how about teaching all kids to obey the police. U r part of the problem with your divisiveness
5 officers dead, many injuried. You incited this. You are responsible
@marcel_tapia79 Non-issue. Don't break the law and don't resist arrest and you will be fine. Common sense goes a long way, folks.
You do know that millions of us have lost all respect for you, don't you?
@SenWarren
@jorgeramosnews I am not a democrat nor a lefty. I have supported police officers. But I am angry about what happened in MN.
@saragoldrickrab maybe to YOU.. not your new racist partner in crime HRC
I am sure you will be just as passionate about the brutal murder of a Dallas police officer. #bluelivesmatter #alllivesmatter
if you watched the video
because there was no pistol on the person that got shot
so the police officer reacted maybe over reacted.
I bet this is what happened. The person that got pulled over had his wallet and pistol in the glove box.
Hey, remember when your new buddy @HillaryClinton called black kids "super-predators"? You disappoint me, @SenWarren. #NeverHillary
@etanthomas36 right now there are attempted murders of cops going on. You've got great points but... Timing of this isn't good
Bernie has the correct history to combat these problems with a much higher degree of integrity than your endorsee. Just sayin.
I drive my children to work and school and pick them up for fear they may become a target.#SAVEOURCHILDREN
absolutely. Thank you for pointing a reality that solely applies to a certain segment of american society.
So get serious about an alternative policing model - that includes unarmed cops!
you want unarmed cops? Did you notice the brutal slaying of a Dallas police officer tonight? Criminal with a rifle
Guns guns and more guns continues the stupid. Tech protects and serves the community.
how in the world does technology remove guns from the hands of criminals #fantasyland
By replacing the need for guns with community policing networks. Pushing guns away from both sides.
sir, I appreciate the thought. But you are not taking human nature and poverty and greed into account.
Just factoring change, and gun ugliness in. Something big has to happen to take guns out. Period.
@jorgeramosnews We can start by teaching kids 2 respect the law..do what they R told..& avoid police contact in the 1st place
@AlisaJass For generations, we Black Americans have lived with terrorism our whole lives. 1. Prison 2. Crack 3. Guns 4. Police
Bless you. Politicos have done nothing but divide. It is by design & too many hear that instead of
@masg66 Cops r above the law & get away w MURDER! Enough is Enough! Ugly society we live in. Crying my heart out
you need to shut your, white, privileged, mouth.
not just black parents, but white parents of adopted black kids are very scared. How do we tell our kids anything?
quit trying to incite more riots. I don't see you out on street without protection. Until you walk mile in their shoes, hush!
@4lisaguerrero I have 4 mixed(Latino/Black)grandsons It has hit me that I'll need to discuss with them issues.Heartbreaking
@JoyAnnReid  The same police that protect you? A little balance please. Aren't you smarter than this?
@ccollinsjr it's #alllivesmatter its racist to only think black lives matter
then fucking do something about it instead of tweeting
LIke ENDORSE the candidate who supports militarization of police and private prisons! YAY Elizabeth.
2x as many whites, compared to blacks, are killed by cops--even though whites commit only 10% of violent crime.
What can we say?
What can we say,?
Also can't ignore a House of Representatives member Cummings playing judge, jury, and.Inciting riots.
New policy: Police pass psych test 1/qtr. if racist can't be police #FBI OVERSIGHT sadly. no trust. can't police selves 
Choked back tear as I talked to my son today. Chkd in to see how he was processing these senseless killings
unfortunately it is not enough, but we continue to teach
When I look back on 8 years of Obama, I think improving race relations is his biggest accomplishment
Why are we spending money on questioning the FBI about @HillaryClinton .  She has been cleared.  #HearingPoliceShootings
Cleared? Hah. This is a centipede - a lot more shoes to drop.
So true, I now had to call my grown adult sons to make sure everything is in perfect working order in your car.
you should do that always.  What kind of mother are you?
@randyprine Real terrorist wear police uniforms. They killed more Americans than ISIS & we are bombing them!
- So all police are racist? Well, you're a liar; therefore, all politicians, law school profs, and women, are liars. Right?
"survive" the police means obey the police instead of giving them the fuck-you attitude!
Speaking of, @realDonaldTrump are you going to speak on ANYTHING that's gone on today besides your disastrous mtg in DC? @SenWarren
you are so on it today!!! Thank you for your actions. You're more of a leader than @realDonaldTrump would ever be.
it already isn't enough
There are more brown people than black. Let's protect brown & black rights. Black Lives Matter & Brown Lives Matter!!!!
@carolscho We need federal level citizen panels to investigate. Locals are influenced or afraid. I'd like to #DisarmThePolice.
it seems like #PhilandoCastile #AltonSterling could not have survived their police encounters no matter what they did.
I find what combats excessive police force is 1) don't break the law 2) don't resist arrest if you do. #workseverytime
So where are all our people in Congress today? Are they meeting to work on this?   No more talk, no more tweets. DO something.
true. You know what else I can't ignore? You support someone who is crooked and thinks she is above the law of the land.
@ADRIAN_KAL_EL time 2let African American officers patrol these neighborhoods 4awhile. Were any near these 2 incidents? #Solution
will you stand against police unions that systemically diminish the value of Black lives?
another criminal liar Hillary!
Yes!! Stop Trump Hate !
#GoToHell Fakeahontas #BlueIsMatter
it's terrifying teaching my kids that the gov't is worse than criminals and to never ever be trusted.
Pocahontas...all you seem do is pander to what will garner you the most publicity...once again shameful.
I Agree!
Someone  is going to have to wake up These black children are being killed by bad cops that need to go to prison
@DAnthonyHiggins we also need to realize there is more black on black crime as well
@TheReal_Db
@MakeItPlain yes and ignore Chicago! #AlllivesMatter
sadly, we shouldn't have to be taught to "survive" the police.#Alton Sterling #BlackLivesMatter #PhilandoCastile
