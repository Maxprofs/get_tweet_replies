How are the taxes collected being spent by those in the position of power. Straight to their pocket? Foodstamps?
Tex elected nimrod #2 (RIck Perry) for 12 yrs due to oil and GOP - obscene - nimrod #1 is DT of course :)
When did Hillary Clinton join the GOP? Didn't Bill sign the deal leading to the demise of the Glass-Steagall ?
Whatever the AGs decide to do, they probably aren't going to go around pretending to be Indians.
@LamarSmithTX2 unfortunately, we will get no help from the AG in Florida.

How bout @HillaryClinton 's big oil buddies? My god, you made the most monumental blunder of your life endorsing her. #dncleak
how about deportation of illegal immigrants #doyourjob
.@SenWarren @LamarSmithTX21 How did you drive to work lady? Your car runs on hot air? Or if electric, 37% of electricity is coal Got It?

But state AGs should be impartial. They are not.
You're looking at oil while Trump undermines democracy. Why aren't you taking him on? Lots of fodder daily.
so when are you going to complain about all this pay to play corruption in your own party? #Guccifer
The creator gives power to the unwealthy. They just have to be brave enough to use that power. #StrongerTogether!
Welllll  that may depend on what state you live in. Case in point FL vs NY on Trump University.
Billionaires manipulating Democracy for their own means.
Sen Warren will be POTUS someday.
please boast about what you have accomplished in the Senate.
O guess when Dems can't get something thru congress they just move on to abuse justice system.
Stand tall
Sen Warren, I think this would be great! It will provide a public forum for articulating ExxonMobile's excesses.
If TX numbnut won't haul in Exxon for malfeasance, IMO the next best thing is a forum for AGs who have
: And Hillary cowers to Wall Street and her Middle East cronies where women are treated as sub-servants.
Entire GOP r try'g to undermine every aspect of govt. 
Why elect people into power who don't believe in govt?
Right OUR gov only cowers to KILLARY & allow her to RISK NATIONAL SECURITY..
I wish that were true in Texas :(.
They cower in Oklahoma day after day, year after year. Shameful state of politics in our apathetic state.
keep up the good work Elizabeth! The bible warned about people like Lamar!
- So much for "States Rights."

As a Texan.... *Sigh*
Pocahontas on the warpath #WackJob @SenWarren @LamarSmithTX21

Thanks to you and @RepKClark for standing up strong and fighting back!
Sen Warren: maybe time to campaign for Hillary in NH?
Wanna bet?
if the AG's didn't have anything to hide, Congress wouldn't need subpoenas now would they?
how much you pay the DNC for your next gig after Hillary steals the election ?
stealing what?  Do you even know what you're talking about?
yes you fucking egg do
No one cares what you think!
No, they just rub their hands waiting for the next big donation.
Do you regret not endorsing Bernie yet?
No cause she got to stand next to the anointed one! So all's good with Liz! @Old_Bern_Kenobi @SenWarren @LamarSmithTX21
