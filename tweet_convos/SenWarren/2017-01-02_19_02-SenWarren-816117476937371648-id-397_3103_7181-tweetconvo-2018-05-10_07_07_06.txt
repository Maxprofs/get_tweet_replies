Never thought I wud C the day when-legal honor patriotism were exchanged 4 treason fraud dishonest referring 2 U.S.
well those idiots have been given the keys but no car and it's not a good start. Hold on it's gonna be a bumpy ride!
-Soon they will have the car,and drive America over the cliff.They MUST B watched
Am I the only one that thinks Trump works 4 the mob-organized crime-racketeeringhttp://usuncut.com/politics/media-silent-trump-seen-partying-mob-associate/ …
But Hillary was a stand up politician, right? 
Get back in the flock with the other sheep!
Yea she is.
You can always move like Rosie! (I would avoid Canada though,,,)
Y would I move-the majority thinks the same-Trump's going down-even Pence is better
So your saying Trump won't be POTUS on the 21st?
I'm not saying when-just that's inevitable

And we need #30RforUSA to #ImpeachTrump
We need to ask all 247 R's if they will uphold the US Constitution & their oath if office.
@2kranch 
@Trumpnado2016 @2kranch -R there not even 30 Repubs that will put country before party?
.@RepWebster This is an opportunity for you Daniel Webster. Your constituents are watching in central Florida
Phone calls are the most effective way.

got off plane.  Call even if not State constituent!
--calling to #impeachtrump #loganlaw #constitution
Where were your concerns with the Clinton Foundation?
Dances with Lies @SenWarren you can't possibly have been a professor, your statements reek of logical fallacies.  @realDonaldTrump
@freeandclear1 @realDonaldTrump Where were u yesterday when @MaxineWaters called for 1 senator to sign? #TheResistance
Let us talk about ethics and lies and conflicts.  Remember when you claimed to be of Indian ancestry?  BLahaha
if he wanted he could get extra money from us instead like obama did would you prefer that?!

@macmommamary @realDonaldTrump So what are your plans to stop him?
correct  @ABC @CBSNews @NBCNews @CNN reporters must ask substantive question at press conf. Wed. And demand coherent answers.
trumps better than you. Go lie about being an Indian somewhere else and stop obstructing the will of the people
Drag him, Warren! We are behind you 100%!
Stop whining, you let Obama get away with almost ruining America. Finally can have comfort when Trump is POTUS.
At least Americans know that Trump won't try to get rich by selling out America-you can't say the same.
He will never announce plans. His plan was to always get rich off the Backs of American's . #Dumptrump2020
Only a #libtard would want someone to sell all they made with hard work. You love #LazyAss people. As you are.
it didn't work in the primary it didn't work in the general and it's not going to work now Elizabeth Warren
SU you are the scum we want out of OUR HOUSE! GET OUT!!
scary that you ever taught young people your dangerous ideology.
@farandwee @realDonaldTrump were counting on you Senator
False claims?  You're the expert Liarwatha.
My god will you shut up. You lost all credibility when you lied about being an Native American.
Please go away !
whatever you say Pocahontas ..... your opinion is irrelevant.
you jealous cause you cant bully him?
SHUT IT
You & Congressional Dems are going to have to sue @SpeakerRyan to force impeachment proceedings. You know he won't otherwise.
This worries me!!!!
a protest at all City Halls Nationwide on inauguration day would send a message to Trump. We don't want him.
Eric Trump forced to shut down his Foundation which helps children. Corrupt Clinton Foundation not investigated.
@LAangel49 @realDonaldTrump Trump will never be honest & transparent unless the force of law is applied. #FireDon #PresElectPutin
@peacemsw @realDonaldTrump -He has tried 2 conceal his MANY business interests with Russia&still hides taxes.#TheResistance
speaking of conflicts of interest, so glad warren will push devos this Monday via HELP committee!!
Please tell us how we can impeach Trump, He is going to cause all kind of wars and fighting in the USA. A menace
@Garage_Floor Please demand production of tax returns as condition of confirmation hearings.Might ball up works & U should have.
Need a tissue?    Your bullshits done!    Resign!!!!!! Choochooo .  @realDonaldTrump
he never released his tax returns so what do you expect.  I only wonder if he can defraud us 4 the all 4 years.
What about the tax returns? This man is a genius at deflecting people from what he is hiding!!!
Please let us know the status of the following (see link). Will there be a bill? Thank you! http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/elizabeth-warren-donald-trump-business-conflicts-of-interest-bill-legislation-a7478656.html …

Just called @timkaine & @MarkWarner to urge co-sponsorship of your bill on Trump's Conflict of Interests.
I agree w/u on dis one. fight 2 let everyone know of trumps #conflictsofinterests

@JimKilbane @realDonaldTrump Hey Lizzy, remember when u looked the other way on all Clinton conflict of interests? #bernieorbust
Is that all you got!   Quit dividing America!
This indicates that he's completely ineffective which may actually save our planet and keep us from WWIII.

@realDonaldTrump
Yeah... All the plans,strategies, and reveals are always down the road.
we can go ahead an prep impeachment for double dealing now #notmypresident #impeachtrump #stillwithher
https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=UE_H_xeXIAY …
from an objective business (and politically neutral ) standpoint, this is done to keep all options open
STAY on donnie's ass! He should put it all in a true blind trust, but he thinks he can do anything he wants
He is the walking definition of conflict. Emoluments, anyone?
And we need those tax returns too!
say something good about what he got ford to do, u are so negative. Worst politician of all time
Is it feasible to decide what to do with 10 billion dollars in 60 days, that took years to acquire.
let's remind him he lost the popular vote
@Republican4Hil @realDonaldTrump He is trying to find a way to do another con job. Isn't he impeachable the minute he takes oath?
Not clear on that issue.
I know.We've never been here before so it's hard to know what can happen.Will it happen is the ?
Who knows...it's 2016-2017 in America. Anything goes apparently.
and when is he going to RELEASE HIS TAXES? #trumplethinskin
dems need to demand divestment every day and watch him like a hawk.
@KarenSkeens2 @realDonaldTrump Do elected leaders plan to take any actions about the Trump conflicts of interests? I call & call.
creating problems nagging lying Poco?
this is how much he cares for others. 2014 #TrumpLeaks
Do you think he cares? He's attained the most important position to help out himself, his business & those like him. #TrumpLeaks
how did clinton become so wealthy after 30 years of public service?? Clean up ur own first
he is excutive producer of Celebrity Apprentice saw on credits last night.
You lost love,, he's done more in 4 weeks than youve done in a lifetime in politics,, Walmart are hireing btw,,
"when the president does it it's not illegal"
https://theintercept.com/2017/01/03/treasury-nominee-steve-mnuchins-bank-accused-of-widespread-misconduct-in-leaked-memo/ …
He's still formulating the lie
really? Don't blame him.
Liz Warren.. Is it time for you to tell America that you live on sleeping pills? You are hysteric. BE Quiet..
ALL Democrats shold #BoycottTrump and his inaugeration.
Make him quit and admit the Russians stole 4 him.
@RubyCodpiece @realDonaldTrump Maybe Kerry should give up Hunts ketchup? obama couldn't give anything up-he destroys not produces
words from propagandists vs facts
The more we learn the more conflicts and potential FCPA violations we see.  DOJ needs to investigate
can't help but wonder if he'll end up mpeached b4 end of 2nd yr & the term "treason" won't leave my mind re  Russia/Putin 
But it was OK for Clinton to use the office of SOS to enrich her foundation????
Where's your tax returns? What are you hiding? Russian connections, corruption, and conflicts of interest
Can the Republican Congress change the Logan Act or abolish it? Are they planning on gerrymandering as well?
And THAT'S why you should have supported Bernie. It WASN't "her turn"!
and....there's that tax returns thing.  #unfit
warren! Who cares!! He is saving jobs, he is working for the American people, stop being a divider
President can't have conflicts . . . now where have I heard that before. Oh! Yes! "If president does it it isn't illegal." Nixon!
You know you're gonna have to run in four, right?
Liz please stay on it his cabinet is busy making money off future Bussiness deals! Tax Cuts for the Rich taking!
He truly plans impeachment, get $$$,leave leftovers to others: more 'bankrupcty'.Shame about nukes
I just  how everyone has so easily transitioned to saying sons will run business, when it was his 3 eldest b4
Because Ivanka&Jared decided to move to DC... Daddy just couldn't handle being so far away from his prescious
stay on it he cannot get away with everything!!
really though, is it any surprise from the man with tiny hands?
donnie have your lawyers read up on Logan Act and #conflictofinterest you can be #ImpeachTrump #LiarInChief
@tpowers6pack @realDonaldTrump What is going to be done about this????? This should be ILLEGAL!!!
he's a crook con man should be behind bars #NotMyPresident #ImpeachTrump TAXES?
thinks he's going to get away with this. He isn't
#realpressconference This can't be how we communicate- Pres Elect stop hiding. Press conference now!
because he won't without ethics already. I am sad for my beautiful country. Sad.
why would anyone sell off their private assets to take public office , silly .
if he waits long enough, he wont have to answer at all.  all the sheep are falling in line w/ethics changes.
@mikeofmuth @realDonaldTrump That tells all. He has no intention of separating business from office
Not to mention his tax returns!!!

This guy is like "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and he is PEOTUS!?!
So glad you are fighting for us.
"Drain the swamp", has turned into "gut ethics committee", show some leadership Trump!
Getting tired of tweets and tweeting, when is the judicial branch of government going to indict this crook!
where's his taxes.
Oh he will when he is ready.And unlike Hillary he's in office for the people,not to enrich himself like Hillary
I bet this is 3/4 of the reason the Ethics Department has been gutted.  #noaccountability
@summerbrennan @realDonaldTrump Or releasing his tax returns, without which we don't know enough about his potential conflicts.
We can refer that to the Independent Ethics Office. Oops, no we can't. It disappeared in the swamp.
@GeorgeryGreg @realDonaldTrump Investigate Indonesian connections please.ASAP, we need all Truth seekers to unite.3mil &growing
@djmincey11 @realDonaldTrump go get 'em  Senator! Don't let up. U got a long 4 yrs ahead of u-keeping Benedict Donald in line.
He still hasn't released his tax returns!
And what is to be done about it?  How will Congress force him to comply with the Constitution?
@josh_emerson @realDonaldTrump he is taking appropriate steps unlike Hillary Criminal Cartel
@barbaraward235 @realDonaldTrump This will never happen. Americans need to resist in the masses.
https://twitter.com/kattykissem/status/816253912504221696 … @SenWarren
@Elise_Jordan just laid out classism of @realDonaldTrump #Vets lose legs in service of yet he about his  @Morning_Joe  @DeptVetAffairs
instead of constantly bashing him, why not try to find ways to work WITH him?  The election is over.
we the people insist that he does! This is not a game . This is peoples lives. He  creates mis trust.
He announced his plans for his biz at New Year's party by gushing about his biz partner Hussain Sajwani
New video shows Trump praising Hussain Sajwani, a business partner in Dubai, at a New Year's Eve party in Palm Beach http://cnn.it/2j3Hzwu  
it's clear that the republicans intend to abandon all investigations into ethics violations, even from POTUS
quit tweeting about Trump and start tweets about what is impeachable. Be specific. Break down DT policies and why they won't work
@summerbrennan He's sole-owner of 500 separate companies-that's a lot of conflict https://twitter.com/trumpnado2016/status/808666484838952960 … https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trumps-u.s.-federal-income-tax-returns …
is making Nixon look like a choirboy.
Clearly he means it in the Nixonian sense that if a President has conflicts they don't count.
nor release his taxes.
@JustAGurLnSwedn @realDonaldTrump As we all know: an office requires professionalism. An incumbent President must be true.
Call him. I'm sure he will put you in touch with his legal team.
he won't need to now, ethics are for losers
Don't worry about it. U r gone anyways
Trump has no intention of relinquishing control of his  businesses. The man is a living conflict of interest.
trump is busy learning how to iron his kkk hood. Steve bannon is teaching him.
.@SenWarren the GOP are going to appease demented Trump and it will be corrupt business as usual, there is no morality just opportunity
@OfficeGovEthics @ConstitutionCtr- he problem will TRY 2 change the ancient rules so it can accomodate him.
@PortiaChalifoux @realDonaldTrump Yes. So what are you going to DO about it, Senator Warren? #StopTrump
give it a rest. You and your party have failed. Time to give the other party a chance.
He was a business man before the election. Built an empire. He didn't collude with foreign governments & buy an election. Give it a rest
Go away @SenWarren you could've been VP #BernieWouldHaveWon @occupyhr_ @realDonaldTrump
Warren is a fraud and a puppet for the Oligarchy Regime. #BernieWouldHaveWon #NoDAPL
poor child hit her head and is rambling garbage. Deplorable at its best
cheating the loser of primary through to then lose General elected Trump

yes you are. hello!!!
Don't worry, for Trump will make America great, and you will enjoy the fruit of his hard labor.
According to @RachelMaddowSho Trump made $$ doing business with Speaker of the House of Indonesia Hotel& GClub.
will make a general audit of democrat works, we'll see how ethic it is... Btw about the recount money? Any left?
Show us your taxes for God's sake.   What's your plan man?
USA is now Trump's cash cow. How do we say "moo" in Russian?  His taxes would likely reveal a swamp of conflicts
Lizzy you must have eaten too much Chinese food, you are speaking gibberish. You fool only yourself.
everything he says is false, so no surprise there. #DrowningInHisOwnSwamp
How is making money a conflict of interest?  He's only getting a dollar a year being President.  Gotta eat.
of course he hasn't, he's too busy w/ Putin. What will it take for his followers to realize he's all about $$$$
we're going to have to fight him on that one, apparently
Lieawatha Warren: what about your conflicts (Indian, really?) please shut up.
@cnnbrk @nytimes @CNBC  Drumpf has yet to sell and divest and place 500 businesses in blind trust that lying pig
shit haha ffs, do you literally just wake up once every two months to collect fresh low hanging fruit?
he doesn't get that just because a POTUS can't be charged doesn't mean it isn't unethical
He thinks we're all stupid. We r not! U r a public servant. U work for us! Tweeting like ur 15 is so unbecoming!
Put it on the list with the rest of his lies. #horrorshow
IMPEACH THIS MAN..HE MUST GO! He is killing our democracy!!
that press conf. will never be held! Haven't U learned his strategy yet? Deny, Deny, Deny, Divert. Repeat!
will pledge all profits to charity. Are you satisfied?
#habitual liar
Trump hs done nothing to untangle his bs conflicts & GOP has gutted ethics oversight.Does no 1 care abt America
do something about it
@thomtweet23 @realDonaldTrump perhaps he is collecting food stamps 2 purchase ur failing business!
Trump is an Enemy of Freedom and an Enemy of America, along with the GOP. #disgusting

patients lizzy! He's not President for another 19 days! Go back to your knitting or baking crap!
ma'am what are you doing about this? You have power. Use it.
@Caddyweese Please stop him, Senator. He cannot be inaugurated while he's in business. Use the 25thAmendment. B4he has Cabinet.
you've got millions behind you backing you up. Pls guide us, we want to help.
Well he did decide to not work on his current businesses while in the office of President .
He's got to choose something as his primary focus , though , of course .
isn't there anything we can do to keep out these swamp creatures filling the WH and Congress? I think I'm drowning in GOP sludge
Liz its time to retire ur oblivious to the laws of being POTUS
we know need pres elect laws since trump is first to ignore the traditions and integrity required tax returns business conflicts
.@SenWarren @TarotofDeath .@realDonaldTrump   Trumps Tax Returns?  Can we now see them please?
he will use his power to get richer and take from the poor.
. Granny has been hitting the jug again.
This is what he has planned!!
No, didn't show taxes.  He is going to tell us tomorrow what only he knows about the Russian hacking.   Right...
we are counting on checks and balances. How can concerned citizens help?
@rolandsmartin @realDonaldTrump Doom!!. Ethics closed down? Nuts! No more democracy. Trump is N control. HELP!
