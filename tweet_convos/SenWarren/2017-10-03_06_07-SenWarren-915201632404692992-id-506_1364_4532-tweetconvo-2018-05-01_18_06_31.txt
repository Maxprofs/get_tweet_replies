The federal government cannot turn its back on our fellow US citizens who are stranded without food, water, electricity & medicine.
Representatives. PC is out the door, so give it to him he likes direct, let’s give him direct!
Of his own medication. But don’t hide behind a social media account. If you’re going to do something like that be a man with balls and do it
Apparently that’s the only way to get through to him. He wants stubborn let’s show him stubborn. He has no idea the shit he is stepped into. And he has no idea of the power of the people. So you think what you want to, but I think he needs a clear big dose of his own medication.
I don’t know what universe you’re living in, but I live in the real universe.
Senator Warren, according to 45’s tweet which is an official White House statement, PC is out the door. Time to step up and give him a taste
She couldn't go toe to toe with POTUS on her best day. She is a weak leader.
Yeah, wait till he takes Medicaid away and you either have to go and take your mom or dad or relative out of the nursing home, what then?
The answer is, you were screwed.
Thank you
The total lack of compassion & inhumanity yet more evidence DT is 100% inept & MUST be removed from office. to rescue, relief workers.
Don't worry! Trump had it all under control with their Governor and FEMA. Your hand wringing wasn't necessary! But then, you knew that!
Quit talking. Go help them. Your words are verbal paper towels. They do nothing. Act! Go help.
It's The #RESPONSIBILITY Of The #People of #PUERTO RICO #NOT The #Government ! You Got #EVERYTHING  Backwards #Warren. Dam Your So #STUIPID
Then send someone to tell the corrupt mayor & Unions about that
It is nothing but third world experience in so called first class country. USA failed to take care of its citizens very badly.
The only support Trump is Willing to offer is  throwing paper towels and 2 bags of ice.
yourimplication that relief for puerto rico an virgin slands was not prompt enough is so outrgeouever heard of fema your a cheap politician
What are YOU doing to help? How about you go down there and drive a big rig to deliver the supplies ?
SO take some of your millions... go there, roll your nasty woman sleeves up and GET BUSY!!!  Funny thing about libs... fast to squeeze the taxpayers while they sit back and GET RICH!!!
I am a procurement expert.  I studied PR contracts.  Looks like they are competing them: a very slow process. Why wasn't J&A signed.
Tell the soldiers, sailors and Marines who are there working 20 hours a day we are NOT acting.
There are people in America, mainland, that have no food, water, jobs, medical but never a word. Only trying to exploit a tragedy.
Why are you Tweeting? Politicians aren't suppose to Tweet & talk directly to the public, remember?
So, give them freedom and independence. End colonialism and imperialism now. They deserve it.
More liberal lies!
Guarantee that you could not even find Puerto Rico on a map. Now your fake concern is pathetic
Too late Elizabeth, Pres Trump already took care if it
All you seem to do is give speeches and complain
Why dont you get on down there then Sen Warren?  Can you drive a truck by any chance?
Write a personal check @SenWarren 
No one is stopping you!
#PuertoRicoRelief
Hello we know your completly dishonest but nice try
If you can do more than our President. Shut up and do it. Otherwise stand down
How come u guys think government is  only way to help-what about the hundreds of charities like  Samaritan Purse, Salvation Army, Red Cross
WOW: Cop in PR says San Juan Mayor won’t let supplies be distributed. Intentionally trying to sabotage Trump.
You're not even thinking about them..you never have....its all politics for you..next time tell the truth
Warren, Pelosi & Schumer apparently not too worried about our citizens in Puerto Rico they are tweeting more abt saving the DACA illegals!
Go help them miss Warren and stop talking about it,go,go, go please
You only care about yourself and power.
We have already acted pochahontas get your head out of your ars
Well hell why don't you go down there and help them . I mean they have been SOL since Obama was in office so where the hell have you been
So now you are PR?
Where are you hiding? There has been help all along. Move on.
You are Puerto Rican? I thought you were an Injun!
If I ever decide to become a liar would you give me lessons? You're one of the best.
We are acting now. It's an island.
So Senator..stop talking and start doing! Best thing you can do is impeach 45!
Let’s do more than worry Elizabeth. As Marty Taplin would say, tell me what you need me to do!
Plain and simple, @GOP and DT supporters, NOT speaking truth to power, this suffering, pain and death is on you GOP & inept DT. Period.
Lizzy, if your so worried, then why aren't you down there in PR helping @POTUS ? Just askin'.
You're worried sick about losing your spot at the Congressional feeding trough.
More Progressive Drivel.
Then go help, mushroom head
First you lie & claim you're Native American Indian & now you're Puerto Rican? Which is it?
Nobody's stopping you. Go there and help. Our President has already been there. Have you?
Please! when hve u ever come up 4 air 2 actually DO SOMETHIMG-Proof pls-All u do scream lies abt Reps..ur typical Elitisrs TALK NO ACTION-

Big Chief Warren brings lots of buffaloes for peace offering to the liberal tribe
The MAYOR of San Juan should have been doing her job!!!!!
Warren, A REAL PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS IT UNDER CONTROL. YOU CAN GO TO THE TEEPEE TO TAKE A NAP NOW.
Stop it already. I can't believe the way the DNC blatantly lies and lies. All the corruption investigations lead to the DNC
Well Lieawatha is true to form with the vial attacks on the Prez. Major road block is the dufas Mayor and Hillary supporter. Goods are there
Pocahontas's! Please keep up! President Trump took care of this last week! You Warren are just so ignorant!
Actblue is a political fundraising site for the Alt Left. Be careful who u donate to
While u pontificate thousands of volunteers and first responders r there assist.Why r u redirecting people to donate to actblue ? U scam.
Why are you asking for PR relief donations to be sent to http://ActBlue.org  a liberal fundraising site. Sounds like deceit and #Scam 
Is Pocahontas Puerto Rican now too?
So now you're Puerto Rican? 

@POTUS has been acting on it for weeks.
@GeraldoRivera look at this she's spreading fake news about president trump 
Why don't you go there and help?
HABLADORA
You wouldn't know the first thing about helping people you've preyed upon 4 years. Why not ask Larry Mizel to get a private plane & donate?
The Puerto Rican docks are filled with U.S supplies why no concern for the genocide commited on the unborn ?
Why aren't you there then?  Zip it fraud
Are you serious?! @realDonaldTrump @fema @StateDept @DHSgov
Who you kidding there Pocahontas the only person you care about is yourself. Just like your gal pal killary.
Did you get on a plane to go help them?  I didn’t see you there?
US supplies everything for PR..  And you dnt have a truck to supply them.What can US do?? Stupid liberals.We saw all the foods US provides.
Oh yeah Mayor was to busy partying with a terrorist . If she cared why the h@ll did she let parts of PR get run down? Money to her pocket?
If u r that worries tell that crazy mayor to tell the truth. But u won't because u love lies.
They had run done electrical grid before the hurricane but now thanks to the @POTUS they will have new one so what did Mayor do with money?
Take your lazy @ss down there and drive a truck instead of running your mouth.
Disquieting liar
Go ahead and puke you will feel better it relieves that sickness feeling
Nobody wants to hear from you... Now sit down and read your book that cannot sell so #BarnesandNoble  reduced
Loooony Lizzie, you are going to start working?? WOW. How many years have you been in DC now?
airports are open. Or you could sit there and just tweet shit. I guess it's the same.
Can you build a few teepees for them? #fauxcahontas
In terms of wicked Warren sick is the causal noun
Never mind cost she'll steal that from the middle class later so easy to make such pronouncements not her money nor does she even care
Then by all means Ms Warren. feel free to write a check. Then you will have "done something"
Whe is ms Warren going to send help
Progressives love to  spend OTHER people's money. Never their own.
Never the millions they make
you turned your back on them by not going and help get the food and water to the poor ones on the island.Military doing all the work
Then get off ur lazy pochantus and go down there and help. PUT UR MONEY WHERE UR MOUTH IS
Get your Head out of your ass Warren. More than enough help down there. Why don't you go there!!!
Lizzy you would fit right in there a mismanaged corrupt government
When will you stop your hateful rhetoric
Angry Liz is such a sincere soul. Why is she bashing the Federal Gov she and Democrats created? Oh yeah - hurricane disinformation politics.
Sorry Liawatha, they are getting help.  Why do you always have to lie?  You are embarrassment to Mass.  I was born here and you were not.
I thought Native Americans and Spaniards did not get along
Been living in a cave? Abundance of help in PR. 

Unique circumstances cannot always be instantaneously solved by throwing people at them.
Wouldn't it be great if our politicians actually cared about more than their agenda and adding to the hot air?  Talk is cheap.
The world watching Puerto Rico, & Democrats be like…

#TuesdayThoughts Oh myThat's a lot of love for our @POTUS Trump in Puerto Rico!Now fake news CNN has a lot of explaining to do 
Does that mean you are going to run in and buy properties for pennies on the dollar?
Any fellow native American’s there?
Maybe get off your ass Devil Warren go there and help them stop complaining DO SOMETHING 
LIAR
"Brothers and sisters?" Is Pocahontas claiming to be Puerto Rican now?
Worry doesn't fix anything. Get some of your people together and go help. No #Jawbones. #Backbones get it done.
Warren is nothing but bottom feeder  for attention. She needs 2 crawl back in hole she came from, Pres Trump has got things under control
Then go your ass over there and go to work instead of running your mouth
KEEP ACTING POCAHAUNTICE.  MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD ACTING. YOU ARE A GOOD ACTOR. CHECK THE OTHER BOX NEXT TIME. NO SOLUTIONS JUST ANGER
Sen. Warren, thank you. We have an expert Recon Aide Team leaving for P.R. #noredtape #BostonStrong to #PRproud http://Humanrightsfest.com 
@SenWarren when she's out of a job
Trump is but the Dems will not publish the fact. They will lie about Puerto Rico, Trump, & Tillison. Dems will wring their hands & cry foul.
He is doing better than any democratic has
Wake up. They are being helped now. Maybe you just want to take advantage of tragedy for you advancement politically.
well, Liz, it's the corruption on the islands at the gov't level that is the problem. These are Dems. what are YOU going to do about it?

Such a Lyin Evil Nasty woman!Pres Trump has pulled all the stops out!STOP actin as if he's doing nothin!Remember bimbo 2 hurr in short time
Yeah, they can't afford to give the democrats more money now
You are pathetic. My office in Mass is sending shipments to PR. 10 more boxes FedEx today! What are you doing you lazy Senator?
Instead of whining how about a solution to speed things up? Shut up Pocahontas and do something useful.
if you're worried then GO to PR
Oh my gosh seriously. NOW. Congress can fix anything!!! Unless it's important,  then congress will fail, again.
Stop saying it and start doing something then....
They will be fine Pocahontas. Being "worried sick" doesn't help. Why didn't you join POTUS down there for a visit? FEMA, military gr8 job
I thought you were an indian; are you Puerto Rican as well. Phony
You must help lead the way and kick #Trump’s butt on the way.
Helping with h2O and electric is more important than phone service.
Watch news other than, CNN. you would know help IS there and has been. PR had junk infrastructure b4 storm. Nothing to fix- need all new.
Are you still having delusions about the President holding back aid from them ? You really should go to PR as soon as possible
Well, act. No one is stopping you from doing anything. Go. Now hurry along.
you are a  joke.

No worries I believe our president is flying back (NOW) from Peurto Rico. 
Can some of "our brothers and sisters" move in to your house ??
The #potus has already acted, you just keep acting like an Indian Pocahantas
You are only worried sick about yourself let’s face it
AID ALREADY POURING IN ,MAYOR WILL NOT RELEASE, STOP SPREADING LIES
Then get the idiot in the WH out!  If you’re not screaming for that every minute every day YOU ARE COMPLICIT. #EmbarrassedAmerican
HEY... YOU AND BERNIE WIN... MOST HORNET NEST STIRRED UP IN THE LAST DAY. THANK GOD IT'S GETTING COLDER... WE CAN JUST STOMP OUT NEGATIVITY.
You and Bernie always talk like you are not part of our government. Why is that?
Your crazy lady. Do you not watch the News?  They are getting a lot if help. Oh that's right you watch MSM that doesn't show any good news
Pocahontas heep big a-hole speak with fork tongue
GO and act yourself show how worried you are!
We rescued victims of #Harvey & #Irma & have been in PR - we need a way to get more help there. Can you help? http://Crowdsourcerescue.com 
Senator! Small CHEAP solar charging units no bigger than a roll of toilet paper can charge cell phones, lamps, asthma & diabetes devices.
You haven't been paying aention we have been acting since day one no thanks to you
You are a shrill neurotic granny. American needs a strong leader. But please try. Will make a good foil
so act. Your rich and in the govt do something
As a puerrorican according to Pres. Trump I am a burden to the government and we did not suffer a real catastrophe.
We are
Start worrying about the bevy of lies you foster for your own agenda.
But you're indian, you hate Puerto Ricans!
#POCAHONTAS are you still on this... your narrative has been debunked for days. Must not be any TV in teepee   #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
Oh please. You are the problem here along with your liberal two faced cohorts
@USVInews  That sounds GREAT! Let's see YOU actually do something, anything at this point is more than YOU have done.
16 people have died in PR.that's horrible for the families but really16 people.....WE R DYING.really????that whore totally disgusts me..
Sure she is!
Trump has it taken care of
Ok Liz road is blocked so u walk out there to give them water. Yeah I thought so.
Then fly down there and help 
Then get off your arse and go to PR, Pocahontas
Cat 2 hurricane Irma caused outages for more than a week. It's going to take more than 3 weeks to fix damage from Cat 5 Maria. #dumb
Talk is Cheap
AND.........??? What are YOU doing to help?
We have.!! Don't play the drama queen.
Man shut up.
Typical left always trying to pollute twitter with #propaganda.
@realDonaldTrump who just did condescendingly to Porto Rico people way down island which he would not see. Then he calls this leadership. ?
You've been in contact with your #counterpart the Mayor the of SJ -PR not to help but to instigate #propaganda against all the great help.
SENATOR MAYBE HE WAS LOOKING IF WE SUSPECTED WHAT WAS IN LAS VEGAS!
SENATOR IS THIS A COINCIDENCE THAT THEY MENTIONED HIM ON RUSSIA TODAY!
SENATOR IF YOU LOOK AT MY FOLLOWING !AND THE TIME FRAME FROM TWITTER! HE POPPED UP ABOUT A WEEK AGO!
