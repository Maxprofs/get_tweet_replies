Apparently the DNC gives less than a shit about Democracy. #DemExitIsUnity #JillNotHill
Trump/Pence coming for you Hillary... Indictment/Prison for you witch of the west.. ha ha ha
and you can always look the other way when the CGI boosts millions
You defend only the amendments that help your vagina or votes
.@SenWarren @LamarSmithTX21 We all know Elizabeth Warren cares deeply about the Tenth Amendment.
What about all the lawless criminals coming across our southern border ? Why isn't the LAW enforced there ?
APPARENTLY YOU DONT DEFEND ANY AMENDMENT THAT DOESNT SUIT YOU LIKE THE FIRST AND SECOND ADMENDMENTS. HYPOCRITE
that's an interesting observation considering the Democrats ignore the Constitution regularly.
And you don't support the first or second amendment. Who's worse?
Democrats have trampled the 10th amendment for decades
Lamar Smith has never seen oil slush political funds or dark money he doesn't love more than laws or regulations
:WHAAZAT?
Awesome
Native American lol

@genovese_steve @LamarSmithTX21 While you ignore that our basic right to a free and fair election was denied during the primary!
@SenWarren @LamarSmithTX21
The constitution in Ayer Ma. Cops wife my nurse with holds information of head trauma,no food,water-pinned to bed
has no right to talk to @LamarSmithTX21 or any one else about defending the Constitution which she supports shredding as needed.
Senator Warren probably sucks Hillary's pussy.

The Democans & Republicrats abhor the Constitution.The majority are OWNED & CONTROLLED by special interests

You campaign against 2A and 4A so who are you to judge? #hypocrite
They only uphold the ones that suit them
Warren govt overrides 10th Amendment to suit it when it wants to all AMERICANS know this
like you support the 2nd 5th and 14th amendment #termlimitsnow
Lizzy you are indeed acting like quite the fool.
How dare you! You wouldn't know the #10A if it hit you over the head. 
@LamarSmithTX21 @TenthAmendment
@LamarSmithTX21Also, congress has forgotten it when it comes to states like Colorado legalizing marijuana and the ability to bank
@MattMurph24 @LamarSmithTX21 No, but Trump swears he'll protect article XVII Hahaha!
Or Congress obligation to vote on Supreme Court Justices
loser
@SenWarren @LamarSmithTX21
@SenWarren @LamarSmithTX21
wait you mean that amendment that forbids Obama care? Forbids any federal gun laws? You & retards et al ignore it
Rep. Smith, do the people's business not that of your overlord lobbying special interests. Stop bullying State AG
But let's be real, the 10th has been trampled on any time the Fed Gov wants to. And they get away with it.
With Liz Warren, everything is an attack and a character smear. Such a divisive figure.
and you don't support the 2nd ammendment
MassAG is actively voiding the 2nd Amendment! Nothing should keep her in office!
lol. so #now she's a #constitutionalist. Ok- lets have states determine healthcare/education/retirement/energy
#WTF. Sen Warren invokes the #10th Amendment? Cryptonite to Demokrats.
Note that this is the only time @SenWarren shows ANY interest in the 10th Amendment.
CLUELESS IN CLEVELAND, following an angry bull who will lead them all over a political cliff! RIP-GOP!
Typically craven; get the geniuses  @LouisGohmert & @farenthold to help
lamar is a bought and paid for oil/gas servile shill. Reality, facts, data mean nothing to his pathetic self.
he doesn't care much for the 1st amendment either. Most of the GOP fan base are only familiar with the 2nd.
Where the Dems miss it is we vote for President in droves and forget to lock the congressional door.
Lamar, the fact you're even head of that cmte is a disgrace to this nation. Corrupt and beholden to big oil.
Hillary says she upholds the law but not 4 herself Hillary is #AboveTheLaw #DoubleStandards #DropOutHillary #BernieOrBust
they don't like the 1st clause of the 1st amendment either, and the 2nd amendment they and Scalia kidnapped
how would one kidnap an #Amendment?
read the majority opinion in United States v Cruikshank, kidnapped
Are we going to vacillate btwn  incorporating the Const. And #not incorporating the Const?
@SenWarren @LamarSmithTX21
how is it okay to have someone with no education as the Chair of a Science, Space, & Intelligence Committee?
I always thought you would be a great president, after horrible judgment endorsing clinton.. I don't trust you.. #JillNotHill
@SenWarren @LamarSmithTX21
Hey Pocahontas who interfered with the Clinton investigation? Do support both the 2nd & 10th. Pocahontas Heap big phony!!!!!
people like @LamarSmithTX21 are why folks don't vote - b/c they know their vote doesn't count
What about the 2nd... Or are you more open to negotiations on that one?
@SenWarren
This why we need to clean house if all of you. We are now starting to!
@SenWarren
Whoa, that's getting into double digits.
@SenWarren
stop acting like you suddenly give a shit after endorsing clinton... #NeverHillary #JillNotHill #FeelTheBern
States rights also mean the freedom to restrict freedoms.
Politicians needs to start being prosecuted also. We say no one is above the law, but we allow no collar crime.
release your records.
Kinda like the Dems and the 2nd amendment..  #pocahontas
Oh like SCOTUS  violated the 10th when it got involved in marriage @LamarSmithTX21
Like Roe V Wade, this was case of interpretation of the Constitution.
who gives a fuck
