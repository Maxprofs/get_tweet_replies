- They want to re-write them all because they FAILED miserably, whnich is why Trump will be Prez. @bigmouthpol
Are the 50+ in that bill? I can't find work but not due to lack of education/experience. Requesting your help.
Looks like you have a troll infestation.
@AndreaHolsomba2 Repubs have been writing bills 2help benefactors, &hurt ordinary Americans for much of the last 40yrs.
@HillaryClinton 120 Foundation Donors Gave $13.4 Million To Gov of #Virginia @TerryMcAuliffe campaigns.
what does your unrelated comment have to do with the bill or helping protect us from sickness?
@deejay90192 I want Warren for VPOTUS
I didn't think you would toss out your morals and side with HRC either, but here we are.
Divide & Conquer. Why didn't they address when they had control of house & senate? So they can blame other party!
@HillaryClinton  Charity Aided Clinton Friends.
so I guess you just troll @SenWarren by posting unrelated content?
GOP can do a lot of damage!
I didn't think anyone could shame the Native American . But you did.
and what have you done???
@SenWarren
@Bvweir ~ It's a gift!
@GeeSungee sadly warren sold out and now is the buffer for hillary to hide her criminal actions-was warren a straw dog?
Never underestimate GOP capacity to ignore US Constitution Art 1, § 8 general welfare clause obligation as often as possible @SenWarren
The GOP waves the US Constitution like a flag when it's  beneficial, but trashes it when they want 2violate it.
why the hell are you in the senate for - are you the #1 blame queen princess high cheek bones?
You guys did a stellar job w/ Vets when you had control of house & senate. We aren't stupid. Divide & conquer!
NEW WORD : Urban Dictionary: trump-castro-phe http://trump-castro-phe.urbanup.com/9479884#.V3zuAx3fUy4.twitter …
Your previous tweet said we need competition but ACA did nothing but create monopolies. Why???
More BS-see USA Today' 50 worst US  cities to live in and we want 4 more years of same with HRC--no thanks!
I'm starting to think they're kinda dishonest.
Indeed!  Repubs r VERY dishonest.
Democrat politicians and voters need to step it up. It's not OK to remain powerless against the GOP House and then cry foul.
a CLINTON-WARREN ticket sounds better and better!!  Down ballot wins for Democrats will eliminate the threat!
@LindaCollins11 GOP appear to hate Americans. Love their money but hate American citizens.
So...where's the $6BIL #HILLARY LOST in the State Depart.?
Obamacare is a joke. You take mine if it's so great.
try to blame it on the GOP, turncoat Democrats are same primordial Soup-the Greeks call it Pathos. Without Ethos no directive
@GetWisdomDude GOP unfit to govern!
#TPP will hurt all of us! What say you about Hill's surrogates who essentially greenlighted it in the DNC platform committee?
And what about this?
Physics does not negotiate. It's time for the DNC to stop giving our planet to the fossil fuel companies. 
@babyspittle And people say the GOP can't accomplish anything!
@Normsmusic Never under estimate  the power of  stupid They just don't seem to quit
you are a piece of work, democrats have destroyed the economy with a bunch of people who never created a job or balanced a budget
@BeverlyFolkers Words of a woman endorsing another under criminal investigations are of little worth, #FeelTheBern
Will #Socialist @SenWarren ever care about hard-working taxpayers? Or about public school students.  Those are groups her policies hurt.#GOP
It looks like #Socialist @SenWarren forget to add grandmas, pets, men, and baseball players to her list of groups #GOP wants to hurt?
Pocohontus!!
spend your own money! US is broke from your spend spend spend handouts.
you support #HRC and she gets paid by big #fracking corporations and takes illegal donations in the millions #ClintonFoundation
Loved watching lying MARCO on television say Democrats wouldn't pass Zika not a word about what the GOP added to that bill!
@sherrilee7 @SenWarren Guilty by omission.
the GOP aren't the only ones who cup the balls of the establishment & kill people, Elizabeth. Enjoy hanging out w/ Hillary. BYE
Hey! The #GOP didn't accept millions of $$ from countries that kill gays for being gay and doesn't recognize women rights.
I thought you would be happy! Now women can have their abortions.
thats because the entire GOP has lost its damn mind.  Need proof?  Trump is the republican nominee.. #VoteDem
please become the VP.
they have outdone themselves
Veterans and clean water, hmm  That's one of those new weird combo things they have these days. Like strawberries in a salad.
OMG!
Like Avis, they try hard.
really?  Obamacare isn't anything near what the public was told it would be.  It needs to be dismantled and replaced.
I didn't think DNC could write 1 stmt & vote against environmnt, health care, peace, etc. #DemPlatform
since all the dems do is hurt our vets... and steal our rights... You should know first hand about hurting vets!!
Top Three Priorities for the Zika+ Pandemic Now for all Nations : 

1- Mosquito Control 
2- Diagnostics 
3- Public Education
The Democrats should stop obstructing the H.R. 2577, MilCon/VA/Zika Bill

It should pass as it is.

Time is of an essence...
@deirdrecee don't forget babies!
that's all they're good at - hurting people. shame on @SenateGOP and @HouseGOP - partisan to the last.
#GOPYouOwnTrump
@IngaHansen16 yep, they are some multitasking mofos when they want to be.
@rmasher2 We hear you fake Indian. Let's see your DNA report!
so GOP says anyone needing Obama care.vets,housing Asst.any low income does not deserve help!well I do not agree.
Of course.  We will be heard. If Trump is elected we are in trouble. A haven for racists. No global interaction. Isolationist.
I'm  sure that is a lie.
Once a liar always a liar.
Indian my ass.
Worthless human being

@WrapNik75 You seriously underestimate the GOP's desire to hurt women.
@ManMet80 @SenWarren @WrapNik75 GOP has been attacking women bec they r easy targets & big distraction fro their negligence.
You r not going to help Clinton - you said guys many times in your speech. You must hate guys. Trump loves all people.
That's miraculous & 2think they CAN'T design/create/write a bill 2REGULATE automatic weapons which on average kill 35,000 a year
35K in the US?!?
never underestimate stupidity. Just look at Trump supporters.
Didn't think a person could ruin a lifetime's work in public service, klout, and trustworthiness in one endorsement, but you did.
I won't denigrate babies by saying the GOP acts as a baby would however they are so full of crap crying when needing a changing
The GOP values and strategy are narrow minded they are of one single thought and cry and whine when they don't get their way...
@DebraMessing Can't we vote these idiots out already?????
And by the way, it is Planned Baby Butchers. Talk about anti-woman! How do you live with yourself?
And Obama and Hillary hurt us all with the importation of these Islamic monsters, be another war to get the scum out #bodybags
@pianogirl126 Would an Amendment to force each bill to be about ONE topic at a time help? Both sides have been guilty of this.
@TYTNetwork I didn't think you would sell your soul either but you did, Judas. #BernieOrBust
Crapo, McCaskill support #NPDES fix.  http://ow.ly/ErTw301FB6g   .  Bipartisan proposal that protects public health & environment.

I didn't think you would sell out and endorse Clinton, but here we are...
@TYTNetwork And your presidential candidate will gladly sign it once she's sworn in. Hope you're ok with that as Veep.
@TYTNetwork I didn't think a progressive like you could sellout and endorse Clinton - but you did it.
@TYTNetwork we didn't think you could betray every progressive value in one fell swoop either - but you did it

#NeverHillary
didn't think you would ever let us down but you did #NeverHillary
@TYTNetwork Maybe you should endorse one of them for President.
, but giving up on single payer comes close, right?
I knew they could & would. I also know #Hillary is a #Sociopath just like many #GOPers. So what the hell r u doing with the enemy
Your credibility is shot ever since you tied your wagon to Clintons.Thought you were exceptional..turns out you're just typical.
The @GOP is the party who hates people. We must vote them out. #VoteBlue #Clinton/Warren @SenWarren
and yet, you are campaigning for someone that takes money from the same special interests that they do & inspires these bs bills
did you think @HillaryClinton could laugh about a 12year old rape victim listen》 https://youtu.be/jJ03Nw7ohww 
@GarrettRuby y okay with so many GOP voters; experts write books about it, most of us scratch our heads? why GOP voters, why?
Shame on them!

and that's why you didn't get more money.
Bill Clinton raped women?how can u look at urself in the mirror?
Seriously,ur an oligarchy puppet like Clinton.Bernie or bust.
Could you link to these bill when you talk about them please.
I didn't think Elizabeth Warren would ever join forces with Wallstreet.  
whatever hillary
SenWarren in other words you thought they would not stoop slow low?
With all do respect when will your eyes open?
@Thom_Hartmann There needs to be a bill that restricts all bill to ONE SET CAUSE
@Thom_Hartmann and I can't believe you sold out so hard for the corporate candidate but here we are.
why should we even listen to you? you're with that criminal Hillary. @SenWarren @Thom_Hartmann
The GOP isn't happy unless they are hurting someone.
@journalschism you missed the confederate flag! So. Much.Ugly!
@iRhysTay the GOP are the consummate overachievers aren't they? It takes some skill to write a bill that's tantamount to evil
LYING CROOKED Warren democrats the cause of OBAMCARE recession printing money 21trillion DEBT unsecured borders November TRUMP
@ImaFreespeaker I didn't think a Senator could lie about being an American Indian but she did.
@QueenKika never think never when it comes to this bunch. Look they are nominating Trump #iamwithher
@ImaFreespeaker I think Liz is there to step in case Hillary is indicted
.@SenWarren .@Plantflowes Trump is a con man, fake billionaire & total loser. #DumpTrump
@AnOldLefty Never underestimate the stupidity or greed of this GOP.   They have the range.
First U.S. Zika-related defect birth occurred in my state today. Help! http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2016/06/062816-zika-update.html …
they only write hate legislation
The quarrel, I believe, is over provisions the GOP added, not Democrats: http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/zika-virus-outbreak/senate-democrats-block-gop-s-zika-funding-bill-n600606 …
@TheRework Can Lizzie be trusted to tell the truth about ANYTHING?

 #INCOMPETANTCONGRESS
 #neverGOP 
WE HAVE TO GET RID OF 2nd grade entrance test 4 congress
Upon reading some tweets some miss vets, who they claim to care about. Same, I'm guessing, don't care about women, clean water..
2 bills that will NEVER pass: line item veto, cuz that's how you play your game & term limits 4 obv reasons. Solves most DC BS.
@BeachPeanuts GOP doesn't like anyone.
I think you are talking about Hillary.
Then pass a line item veto bill which will prevent you useless hacks (D&R) from adding non-zika items in a zika bill. Enough BS!
Cutting funding is not hurting, it is helping less.
Thanks Senator...that kind of rhetoric will definitely heal the divisive climate we have today.  Thanks for bringing us together
very proud of you and @HillaryClinton and @POTUS
They are who they've always been - snakes
what are your thoughts on US workplace fatality rate increasing for the first time since 2010? http://bit.ly/25MmXaT 
Enough about zika. People are dying in Turkey due to terrorism our leaders have left unchecked.

@SenWarren
Talented, aren't they?
@KarenRegis That's your club now, Liz

Can we get rid of Republicans in Nov, please?
RT @VFW_Vet: RT @SenWarren: I didn’t think the GOP could write 1 bill to hurt women, vets, Obamacare, ... http://tmi.me/1feFWZ 
Damn they had that many #PoisonPills in the #Zika bill LOL American Ppl are on to them!  They will be out in November.. UGH

Where there's a will there's a way.

I think you put you cart before the horse warren
How did the GOP become so evil? Are they the spawn of the Devil? Bad code? What should we do about these wicked,noxious demons?
At least you don't have to pass it to see what's in it. You forgot Mental Health. Mama we're all crazy now.
Speaking of...I think I went PP in my Tena's.
@The_Trump_Train illegal getting more tax $$ than Vets soooo shut up
They are incompetent like Donald Trump nothing important to say
how do I buy a teepee I'm getting sick of these mortgage payments
impressive and pathetic all at once.
Worse than I thought,why do they hate us so much?We are all Americans &this will hurt All of Us!
Thank you for fighting the good fight, Sen. Warren!
Don't act like the Democrats haven't done it many times.
@SenWarren
said by the women who is for Hilary and her sexual predator husband. Scary .
what is this crap . Is this what happens when someone runs out of stuff to say .
Any Kentucky Kickbacks stapled to that bill?
call it a cluster bill. Like the bomb, it covers a wide impact area, and hurts many more by components activated later.
Because info is needed to get out, we must all put out.
never underestimate these bastards Liz
They are under the mentality to do as I say not as I actually do.They can quote a Bible but don't understand it
Pres Clinton took multiple bills to destroy welfare and financial regulation and to incarcerate thousands but he got it done!
