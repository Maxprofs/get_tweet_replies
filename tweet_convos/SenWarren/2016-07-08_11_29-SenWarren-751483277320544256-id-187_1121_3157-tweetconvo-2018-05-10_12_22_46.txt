you aren't a Uniter, you are a divider. Why would you lament division? You love division.
stop war on drugs. Invest in American workers and middle class, make college affordable
MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE? YOURE BARKING UP THE WRONG TREE.  SHES THE REASON ITS EXPENSIVE.  #NOSHOWPROFESSOR
DO NOT SHOUT AT ME....
You can thank Clinton for charging a quarter million to speak at a university.
Tuition isn't used for speaker fees.
Where does the money come from then? I wouldn't think from the football program either,
people like you Senator Warren are making the divide even wider. You have no regard for the millions who disagree with you!
So are we Liz, so are we.  You can do something about the massive election fraud, just do it.  Stand for something again!
So sick of it you are actively participating in it on Twitter.... 
Hypocrite.
Warren you are a phony!!
That would be U Ms. Warren. Every time u get into your grade school name calling of #Trump U insult millions of Americans too.
Then stop doing it please. You either have too much time on your hands or have many staffers tweeting for you. It's negative.
BHM wouldn't be happy to hear you talk about him like that,
YOU ARE THAT PERSON.
you lead the way with your divisive and hateful rhetoric directed at conservatives

Look in the mirror, paleface
You deserve a prize for that reply. Awesome.

Well then you need to join us at the convention or join us with @DrJillStein after the convention.
Senator you are as guilty as anyone on pulling us apart. You completely ignore 48% of the population. They do not exist to you!
if you were correct people wouldn't fell the need to cuss the democrats  pull me off Liz.
like. BLM?
the whole world over. Wtf is happening in this world. Going to hell in a handbasket.
Then be a part of the solution!
That is because we have a Divider in Chief who spent more time as a Community Activist then he did in the US Senate
@realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton I'm sick at heart that all of you act like children while our world is on fire.
- COme on Elizabeth. YOU are puling the country apart with every word out of your mouth on behalf of H.  @bigmouthpol
Do think the rhetoric "pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon" is NOT hate speech? So why are Dems supporting this hate group?
:  Looked in the mirror lately?
Dems the most divisive party! Keep pushing the plantation mentality!
Let's have all the flower children have a 60's flower power love-in.
you should look in the mirror.  You are smart.  Why can't you argue in respectful ways that inspire not divide.
We'll all cum together wen $hitlery is out o the race n in PRISON! Bernie is the legit Nominee without vote fraud! Ur a sell out!
You feel sick at heart yet quickly pour salt in a wound. You are spreading hate and discontent as well Ms. Senator. #RNC2016
I know Hillary has caused a huge divide with all of her shenanigans!!!
you seem really unhinged. Have you become detached from reality?
please, spare us. Dems weaponized the politics of division decades ago. Hypocrite. Liar. You sow division with every breath.
You spew venom..!!!! What are you talking about?  You are very guilty of this.
you,obama, Hillary and liberals have been causing division for almost 8 years now!
Reading your stupid tweets, its obvious YOU are who you rail against - from your indian heritage to your party, you are a FRAUD
Repugs will divide your country worse than Ukraine!On right paths in doing just that!
You mean Obama?
you must be talking about yourself then.
wow, all I see from her is decisive tweets, and then she posts this.
It made me sick when you endorsed Hillary. #StillSanders #NeverHillary
@sabela13 Ah, but this is where we can clearly separate the leaders from the opportunists.
@YouGiveMeFever7 Hillary is Republican lite- won't ever vote for her 
Like the potus?
I'm sick of looking at unattractive people. I have a right to say this because I re(pre)sent them.
You are pulling us apart. We trusted you. I would have voted for you over Sanders... you destroyed my trust and hope in you.
HILLARY is pulling us apart.  If you wanted unity you would have endorsed Bernie.  It must be very foggy up there at the top.
and who wants the advice from another thief , you need to fix your heart and stop preaching you are the least qualified
that would be @POTUS that is stoking the fire!
I hope u feel called. Wikileaks=Putin who trashed @HillaryClinton Our onlyHope withstand Putin #massdistraction #Evotes Putin's 2
how can we come together when this is the norm?lost generation...
The cops had to do all this to detain a woman?
#BatonRouge
are you speaking ill of our POTUS?
I'm sick at heart about those who would pull us apart 
Perhaps it's time for a bit of self reflection on your part...
Quotes from alot of people:HRC &Obama onlyangry at conservatives & Republicans, butNOT at terrorists! America needsprotection
you've got a lot of nerve calling for unity you are a left-wing version of Trump and garbage like you are what is destroying us.
like Clinton and Obama?  Be quiet
I'm sick of pedophiles hired by correct the record. #ZeroSec #ZeroRepresentation
You should be sick of joining the ranks of David Brock. #ZeroLiars #ZeroSec
You mean TPP opposition and universal healthcare not in the #DemPlatform? Unless you weren't watching...
I'm sick of sellout progressives. https://youtu.be/wPK-uaD8ZE8  http://anonhq.com  #ZeroSec #ZeroHead
I am sick of no representation from mutimillionaires like you Sellout.
I am sick of the plastic progressives in the DNC. Gone to the Green  leaving nothing but a calling card. https://www.minds.com/archive/view/594405579972161542 …

I still believe in the work you do, your ethics and standard. Uncompromising on those grounds
I believe you are talking about @POTUS Obama.
is this condemning BLM and their hateful rhetoric on #Dallas killings? I don't see hateful tweets from police so that must be it @SenWarren
it's ok to be BOTH pro police and pro black lives matter. We just need change.
@HillaryClinton 2 coo coo birds sitting in a tree. @realDonaldTrump is Americas only hope 4 greatness #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
how can u support a lying crook @HillaryClinton ? U 2 will never get in the White House @realDonaldTrump will be next president
is Native American  @HillaryClinton tells the truth. Both lies! @realDonaldTrump is honest strong & will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
why are you sick about it when Bill Clinton enacted 'super predator' laws to disadvantage the black community?  Are you awake?
t.

YOU ROCK! Thank you !
"I invented occupy Wall Street," when things go bad she says "I had nothing to do with that" awful lier
sounds good-together is a party not different communities culture just giving lip-snap service.
u're a soulless crone. U incited the assassination of five brave officers to engage in race-baiting of incidents u had no facts.
Meet with & apologize to Native people. Stop dismissing us.
Tell us what "come together" means. Thanks.
Ironic that it's you and the left doing it. LMAO #Pocahontas ⛇black snowman white snowman
@feistybunnygirl Whatever lady. How about introducing a bill with stronger Civil Rights protections of my people against police?
ask hillary the day befor she sed police should stop killing
people like you fan these flames of racial division and so you should apologize to us
met any conservatives lately?
is this too Trump's fault?
Amazing how after almost every  political scandal a tragedy happens, and all of a sudden the news change and no more politics.
We must never give up hope that love will win.
.@SenWarren Does .@POTUS know you are criticizing his divisive speech from yesterday? There goes your political future.
talk to the boss, please. Get him to stop
The sickest part about it is that they don't even know they are pulling us apart!
left has to stop dividing us by using race constantly always labeling everyone,never blind,always see us as groups,name calling
@janetika1 Clinton should do the dignified thing and stand down, she is a fraud, as are you.
nasty guy
reading re-tweets RE condolences from bothsides people should be ashamed the amount of HATE i see is HORRIBLE find a better way
this is what it has come to anyone in the political arena on BOTHSIDES sends condolences the HATE comes out SHAME ON ALL OF YOU
Eg, @DanPatrick Shame one you, LtGovPatrick. Ever divisive, hateful and simply wrong.
So you're also sick at heart about Obama and his inflammatory rhetoric? So are millions of Americans.
didn't hear from you or Clinton at all yesterday or the day before.
Corruption at the top is responsible for the stresses felt at the bottom, by public servants such as the police.
So tell us, how long have you been in politics again? What have you done to improve things? Just asking! @CNN
you divide us. Go away
I'm sick at heart at your betrayal of progressives ideals.
You have been fragmenting the Nation for the months! You do not defend the Constitution, but blather on about others, SENATOR.
lWe need to remember you can support police and still know it's wrong for someone sitting in his car to be shot on a traffic stop
The first responsible for the divisions are the politicians who are on the payroll of special interests.
Of course #UnitedWeStandDividedWeFall American people are better than hatred and hateful people.
ask majority reps if they really want to come together...reeaaalllly come together...ur living in dreamland if u think so!!!
Why do the @GOP use death as a political football?
There'll never be shortage of footballs the way they're acting!
& it's an act.
much easier to blame guns than rotten, anti cop, black ghetto culture right before an election, right? #BlackLivesMatter
Betyer talk to the one you endorsed about that. #democracyorbust #BernieOrBust
"We must love each other as brothers and live, or we will all die as fools."  from a pastor during the Dallas noontime vigil.
exactly. DONALD TRUMP needs to stand tell for treason for trying to destroy our REPUBLIC. He should be charged with these acts!
Dallas murders result of inflammatory statements by BLM, B Panthers & supporters: Hillary / Obama / Dems pushing false narratives
;  Veterans are in need of mental health treatment for life. Mandatory.
your party and globalism is tearing our country apart
#ShesWithCareless
um, are you abandoning #hillary and @TheDemocrats? They've been promoting false narratives and racial tensions to get votes.
Like when you were gaining traction with disenfranchised voters and then decided to go with the same old same old with HRC? #booo
but that's what u did when u endorsed a #PathologicalLiar who #CantBeTrusted #DropOutHillary before it's too late & Trump wins
you are ALL complicit what have any of you in DC been doing for the last 8 years other than collecting paychecks you didn't earn?
So you'll be waiting a few moments before resuming pulling us apart again?
Projection!
Identity politics and accommodating radical community organizers has bred this cesspool. Take bow!
1 Law for ALL! Nation is dividing & will fall! Name One Corrupt Gov with Separate Laws that survived self destruction! Just 1!
I SENT A TWITTER TO THE FBI IN REGARDS TO FORMER REPUBLICAN REP. JOE WALSH CALLING FOR VIOLENCE AGAINST POTUS. MAKE IT HAPPEN
Hillary Clinton so far is as dumb as what-she can't hear what Trumps issues are. She merely rants stereotypes of 'Billionaires'NO
I didn't know you could say something truthful about Obama.
Language is everything & it is disgraceful how people us it to -to add insult to injury.We need unity! We need lasting equality!
@realDonaldTrump Now that the shooter was NOT a muslim, what does Trump have to say now? ZERO........
Its all of the elected crooks which perpetuate the dividing factor, along with the media.
And it's coming from everywhere. We must remove easy access to guns from the equation. #Enough #NoMoreGuns
then stop
you are one of those doing the pulling
Elizabeth, you're not doing anything to help. Playing Trump's game and barking at him is promoting divisiveness.
The tributes for these officers that is not done when black men are murdered by police is the meat of this conflict. #Dallas
Well be sick at you own party and @BarackObama @POTUS as that is all this party and administration had done is divide since 2006.
you mean like this man http://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/headlines/20160708-texas-lt.-gov.-dan-patrick-calls-dallas-protesters-hypocrites-for-running-from-sniper-s-bullets.ece … how do we shut them up? show them the way? @HillaryClinton will help she gets it
Except you don't have a heart, you opportunist pig. Those dead cops are your handiwork.
@POTUS Rules of Engagement w/ Police: Don't move hands, don't answer loud or aggressive or angry. Stay very calm,request video on
like Rudy Giuliani is doing. Ugh.
The hate preach from Donald Trump's rhetoric is obsolete psychobabble designed to benefit only one person...Donald Trump.
My tweets are not public, but you are certainly welcome to copy & paste!
yes #BlackLivesMatter tends to do that.
Warren u need 2 speak 2 your BFF EVIL HILLARY n tell her 2 call off her BFF EVIL GEORGE SOROS who is PAYING THE THUG PROTESTERS
liberals need to stop inciting
What if we reimagined police as a non-military public assistance force? http://ow.ly/zt4C3023KIB  #AltonSterling #Dallas
@SenWarren
Sen. Warren, this election is very important to all of us. Especially when a delegate does not feel the victims pain. To arrogant
more police shot today
maybe you can work to end 1033 in NDAA then
that would be your party.
Our party doesn't want 2 build walls, our party doesn't want 2 keep Muslims away, our party doesn't insult handicapped
Jesse williams played a good role to be honest!
He wishes!!!
