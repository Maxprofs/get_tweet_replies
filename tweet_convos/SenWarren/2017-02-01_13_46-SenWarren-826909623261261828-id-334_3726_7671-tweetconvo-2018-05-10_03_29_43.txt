Sorry Rep Turing,none of them would be good for business, and worse for democracy
just wanted to thank you for being a stand.  No to all of Trump nominations.
so what are Democrats going to do about this to protect America from all these crooked nominees? Help us
So, why did the #Obama admin do nothing about the #bank crimes?
#Mnuchin
Thanks Sen Warren for speaking out the truth as you see it.  I'm for you   now and 2018...& Pres. Warren?
How would you know? You don't show up.Go spend some more money on @HillaryClinton campaign.be productive
Prie and Mnuchin are crooks who belong in jail, ot in the US government, @GOP. You will be held accountable.
There is no way either of them should be confirmed.
.@SenWarren @HHSGov @USTreasury And, you lied about being an Indian, and failed to disclose 1M.. anything else?  #TomPrice #Mnuchen #winning
@bornsunshine @SenWarren @HHSGov @USTreasury And your out of your FUCKKIN mind!!MAGA 
stop tweeting and start doing
girl I'm constant alert 24/7 and having anxiety over it 24/7 do not tell me I'm not paying attention
me too. Anxiety especially since iran was "put on notice" whatever that means
U Fail to disclose $1M in dark dealings & dare to lecture Dr. Price. Hypocrite U belong in jail #Pocahontas
And you continually lied about being a Native American to further yourself. #Fauxahontas
why is congress tolerating lies and unconstitutional actions? @HHSGov @USTreasury
GOP has no honor and the Dems don't have the numbers.
there is however some evidence a spine might be growing within them. I hope.
Alternative facts! The Donald continues to embrace lies and he's putting liars in powerful positions! Sad!
you lied about being Pocahontas. Move on!
@S3nt13ntB31ng @HHSGov @USTreasury yep, they all lied and would never have been approved b4 Trump.  The good old days of vetting.
BFD
And you lied about being a progressive when you supported warmonger @HillaryClinton against @SenSanders!
he lied? Really? You who got rich at Harvard based in lying?
You know that. I know that. @SenateDems know that. Any responsible @SenateGOP mem knows that.Oh...Aren't any
they open their mouths and lie!
Where is penalty 4 lying to committee? ALL Dems & any patriots left in GOP should vote against. Not normal
prove it! You have lied many times, proven fact you hypocrite
You mean foreclosures on military families like you and your spaded husband did ??? Hypocrite
DeVos plagiarized, and also knows absolutely nothing about education; Sessions will bring US to circa 1967.
illegal foreclosures are pretty serious offense! Why isn't Mnuchin in jail??? Price is not a sweetheart
So put the kibosh on DeVos and Sessions, who also fudged or shaded the truth!
Kibosh would mean that they've already been successful. My attention is paid in cash upfront!
I was trying to be inspirational, not negative. Way to send them out in a positive attitude!
Obama lied about his property in Chicago and how he got it....Ask Hillary about her sweetheart deals !!
Stop calling people liars and start hiring legal people to work at your mansion
You lied about being native american, he makes money you look like an ass....win/win?
@rileysven Our country is falling apart because of this disasterous president and his puppetmasters
@DesignsofWine @HHSGov @USTreasury Bit rich coming from Fakeahontas &her Native American roots. One who speaks with forked tongue
Mnuchin is more provable an alternative fact than Price, who claims 'wink' wink' to have had a Broker 4 deal!
We are assuming that GOP Senators will play by the rules;that assumption is no longer valid;fight fire w fire
Warran's accusations are cheap; Dems defecting to confirm Cabinet appointments, floor of Senate
#LIARS do NOT get a free pass #NOTNORMAL
Sen. Warren, how can we redress the lies told by cabinet nominees?
you mean they presented Alternative Facts.

Crush the LIERS!
Why should Republicans care whether cabinet secretaries lie? They are just following Trump's lead.
doesn't matter anymore I read they pushed them through
calling on every AG in the states where these reside to take action.
so what GOP runs all over democrats. Break rules change rules whatever it takes to steal power
More importantly, what can we do about these lies?
and tRump lies about everything!
You lied about your Indian heritage. So easy to make claims of lying.
everything about this presidency is a nightmare
The GOP is crooked folks, go by stock in K Y jelly, Americans will need it#greaseup
You're a liar.  But we knew that already, didn't we?
Hey, you know who would've been great in the W.H. about now? BERNIE SANDERS! But you decided to support corporate Hillary
We won't ever let you forget HRC & the DNC put Trump in office. You've no credibility. Step down, let real progressives take over
@DennisCardiff @HHSGov @USTreasury GOP knew it hence, changed rules & expedited get them in.
Time to press on and bring them ALL to their feet the knees is NO longer fitting for them.
Pocahontas, do you really want to talk about lying?
Thanks for cutting through the #alternativefacts and summarising what's really happening. You are vital.
and you lie about your Native American heritage. They should do nicely in politics!
More accusations. You have proof Pocahontas?
And you lied about being native and made lotsa money off that lie. Can you say "Harvard?"
Come to the light my children!!
Follow the Bible & law of the land
YOU PEOPLE  FOLLOWER'S OF WARREN & DEMOCRATS! NO WONDER YOU HAVE ANXIETY ! FOLLOWING THE WRONG PEOPLE!
YOU DEMOCRATS ARE CRAZY! AND WERE SITTING BACK WATCHING YOU ALL SELF DESTRUCT!! GOD IS ON OUR SIDE! KEEP UP
and since you lied about being Indian who do we believe
oh no just dragging your feet Party first not country disgraceful
These are lies and slander. Delete Your Account
@SoSofieFatale @HHSGov @USTreasury If tRump can get away with it ..via@GOP..then they can according to tRump.
@Nowsolarwa @HHSGov @USTreasury this seems to be disqualifying, no?
Impeach45 NOW! NO all the way down the Dem line for the Republican SCOTUS. #NationalStrike
@Nowsolarwa @HHSGov @USTreasury Doesn't lying automatically disqualify? And if not, can we get it written into the rules?
We win again Fauxahontas. Can you say Mr. Secretary Price & Mr. Secretary Mnuchin b/c you will 4 years
Isn't that what they call 'alternative facts' - lies? 
Thieves, liars, immoral opportunists, corporate thugs obviously in cahoots. The time is here for heroes!
@fahyhallowell Trump must be hiding something'bigley' on his Fed Taxes..why is he not pressured on releasing them..Our right 2 no
.@SenWarren @HHSGov @USTreasury both of these greedy and dishonest turds aren't fit to be dog catchers let alone high office.
hold their toes to the fire!
stop them all those lies
how do they keep getting rewarded for all their lies ?????
Liars are going to run & ruin this country.  
They have been during the past 8 yrs.
We should indeed scrutinize their past and future shady dealings.
And you lied about being Native American.  What's your point?!!
Quit whining Pocahontas. Hillary lied her entire life and you put your arm around her and tried to pass her off as truthful #MAGA
so the new swamp is the same as the old swamp and us taxpayers get left smelling the stench.
not as bad as Republicans still voting for putting them in office!  Republican sale #adimeadozen
but who lied to get that job at Harvard #pocahantas
This administration setting the example with #alternativefacts
@848d47b1dbf44e2 @HHSGov @USTreasury Dont no law, seems like GOP Senate is doing shady/illegal dealings, & Prez more. Sickening.
...and yet the Dems didn't do anything to block the confirmations. We failed!!
Even with the lies, we, as citizens haven't really been vocal enough. We should all write our congressmen!
How about your failure to disclose your $1.3M line of credit. When can we expect your resignation for that lie, Pocahontus?
What are you going to do about it??  What do you expect the American people to do about it??
@bannerite @HHSGov @USTreasury They need to rename the GOP to the Hypoliarcrats.
sweetheart deal?  Release your @Harvard employment details....NOW!
You lied about being an American Indian.
Thank you, tell us what we can do to help you fix this.
no please not him. Hescwhat nightmares are. Foreclosure machine. Where dies he find these crooks? In jail?
after watching his hearing. Than eating the movie "99 Homes" I'm truly afraid of having a mortgage.
Yes, in fairness, I wasn't pleased about it. But, hey, gotta give latitude. We're trying to uphold #maga
"Pants on Fire" President, "Pants on Fire" Cabinet!
Have you ever not told the truth about anything?????? Don't lie now!!!!!!!!!!!
GREAT!!!! Just who we want in places of trust _ NOT
Terms illegal greed criminal all apply to these two cabinet  noms. Should be prosecuted instead of confirmed
why do you think Trump nominated them? #ShitStormsAComin'
they just took a page out of their new boss's book and lied along with stonewalling disclosure of finances. Are we really toast??
. This swamp monster thing is getting really depressing. Give 'em hell! Elizabeth! We r counting on u.
You claimed to be Native American for personal gain.
is this not against some law?
tell how it is
So you are the designated "lie detector"? Is that because you know so much about it?
stay strong senator
@PattyArquette @HHSGov @USTreasury and where there is one liar in banking, stock certificates, more follow.
Wishing you had come out for Bernie when it would have counted. Hope you are too.
Charge them with lying under oath. Just that simple and just that complicated.
Has documentation of these lies been entered into the record of the committee?
u are misleading ppl.
@Honey17011 @HHSGov @USTreasury / Price omitted a significant part of his income. Should an automatic disqualifier.
@Honey17011 @HHSGov @USTreasury Surprised? Liar nominates liars.
And you lied about your Indian heritage to score a job...how ironic
How about u coming clean on what happened on your 1.5 million line of credit and what happened to it.
lying is the hallmark of this administration
Liars lying because they're liars. More horrible picks.
I suppose the truth doesn't matter anymore.  That changed with the orange one. I can't mention his name
and you voted to confirm Ben Carson?
@suepeac @HHSGov @USTreasury and you lied about Indian biz, being an immigrant,  chiseled on a loan.  So. Please sit down.
Roy!!! You came back! Feeling all fuzzy and warm now
feelings.
you lied about being a indian. Your far worse.
There are consequences for backing the wrong candidate.
Start taking a head count to track and publish on lying under oath to Senate!
meanwhile, U skirt congressional ethics laws by failing to include a $1.3 million.
Dear Senator, @GOP = liar
And now they just get to fly in without any problem. Thanks a lot, @McConnellPress , @SenateGOP COWARDS!!
DRAIN ...
File ethics violation
@drjjr500 @HHSGov @USTreasury.Go after them with scissors. Cut their pockets2find all their lies!!   Cross examine them closely
Remember when Martha Stewart lied. Good Lordy.
@bannerite @HHSGov @USTreasury vote them down
Forget the tweets! Ineffective! Do something !!!!!!
If these ppl can manipulate stock market 2 suit themselves,why would the rest of us want 2 be in the market
isn't this grounds for perjury trials?
Resistance is what you have taught us Senator Warren. We will not go quietly, you have inspired us to shout.
Noone but Garland!!!!!!!!!!
@pldanzis @HHSGov @USTreasury Tell Trump a witch in woods wants him 2 bite a Red apple
@DrLindaShelton @HHSGov Putting aside his lies, Price is either greedy or out of touch w/the science. http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/02/01/512687027/hhs-nominee-tom-price-targeted-panel-that-urged-fewer-cancer-screenings …
Don't confirm!!!!
of course PRICE lied, motivation is in his name,( PRICE), he definitely has A( price) they all lie. Resist!!!
You lied about being an indian...
Price deserves to be tossed out of the Senate. He is a menace. I'm from Georgia. Trust me, I know.
they are all liars. Why is this allowed? #trump #GOP have got to go!
he should be in jail
why do we have a constitution if Gov doesn't up hold it, why do we have laws if our leaders ignore them end result US suffers
I believe this mafia way of governing is to only have all states Red like Russia
Martha Stewart served time for remaking a Post it note so that was a lie..not inside stock trades! Jail HIM!
Sounds Swampy
If U think they lied to the Senate under questioning then bring them up on charges, get on with the trials.
And you lied about being Native American. So what exactly is your point?
these guys should be in jail, not heading a federal agency. Disgusting. Martha Stewart went to jail for less
See here's the thing you really need facts to back up what you're saying & I don't see any
Trump lied more than anyone and got elected. Maybe lies don't matter any more?
Serious question. When Dems take back Senate & House, can they be prosecuted for perjury.
@cykelly1718 @HHSGov @USTreasury where is the 1.3 million
Trump lied about conflicts Taxes Russia Keep those issues BURNING! #ImpeachTrump #TrumpIsMalignantNarcissist
Just prepping for future lies.
again, lying under oath. Isnt there consequences for lying under oath?
& yet @TheDemocrats are utterly inadequate as leaders of the opposition. Get everyone to join unions & prepare for direct action.
@Hannajewel @HHSGov @USTreasury when you lie under oath you do not get confirmed and  of the story
.@SenWarren @HHSGov @USTreasury Can you bring them up on charges? Were they under oath? Is lying on the forms & in hearings a crime?
Are we really expecting anything different?
@GreatDismal Can't any Senator cite someone testifying for Contempt of Congress if they commit perjury?
@Brooke888888 @HHSGov @USTreasury Out Government lineup looks like this 
Warren is the liar, she continuously lies, everybody knows she's a liar
YOU ARE A JOKE!
E. Warren knows all about lying!  Check your record. Are you the pot or the kettle? Fauxcahontas
you didn't seem to care when Hillary was lying...or you about your race. Save your fake outrage. #tcot
Dem party HYPOCRITES
You are a dispicable human!
