what plan? The Fake News kind or the fairy take plan? We lost because angry selfish ppl wanted a change.
We had decent life b4 AltRight Fascist elected by minority now will b gone2make your billionares richer.
How so? How was your life threatened under Obama policy? R U Terrorist?
@SenateDems   @SenateGOP Where does it say in our or GODs LAWS that U can practice your religion to DETRIMENT/Harm2others? ....
they never had a plan.  A cynical, greedy and racist agenda though...
Did u know that POTUS deported more people than any other? I mean if that's what you call racist. Or is it
racist=showing zero respect for a black president over 8 years then to demand respect for TrumPutin!
How's is that racist. I never liked Obama's policies, I am not racist.
Didn't agree with GW Bush still considered him president as did Dems. Not so GOP w O. Obstruction.
And they still don't have brains either. The more they stifle rights, the louder we will be. #Resistance
Are you referring to the rights of people who entered the country illegally???
Any person who has blood flowing,  has rights! But deplorable wouldn't know this, huh?
8 years with luxury of leaving leadership to someone else.  Now that they're in charge, they have no idea how to lead.
Really? You KNOW this. The admin has not even been sworn in yet & has accomplishments already.
don't have a plan because the plan in place works. They know it! A little tweaking and it will be dang near perfect.
for what they don't need & they didn't do it.
@realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP More lies reps had a # of plans,all REJECTED BY OBAMA. he didn't want Reps 2 suceed where he failed
For the Democratic Party, Trump must fail. Their survival depends on it.
its gonna b a long4Yrs,but Trump's tuff!! I didn't care 4Obama,but iGaveHim my supportSad!
Is this the same ACA plan that had to be passed so we could find out what was in it?
take away THEIR healthcare.  Seriously.  WTF!?
I love to read your post, you are honest, you speak Truth, with lots of conviction & no nonsense, I just love it!
100 years of c-r-a-p is the same. No GOP health plan. But they 'must' do away with what IS working. Those clowns. SAD
All the GrOPe has is lies, law-breakers, and love of Russia. @SenWarren @SenateGOP
your funny HOW many lies and laws did HILARY break again .. How many Americans have died BC of her/OB
we all know how much Fox "news" you watch...#BuhBye Trumpkin 
nope it was on other networks also. You cant handle truth.
yaaaaay,  two Trumpkins for the price of one ! #BuhBye 
their PLAN was Russia intervention. #STOPTRUMPNOW B4 jan 20 or we are all screwed. STAND UP NOW
If they Repeal ACA w/o Good replacement then Wash your hands&Tell America GOP Owns ALL consequences&Deaths will cause.
and they never will
not only that but ACA was a republican policy!  They wouldn't pass any of the liberal policies.
They say they have MANY plans, which translates to NO PLANS! @SenWarren @SenateGOP
yeah they have "lots of ideas"
 Ha. Just trying to make rich richer. They don't care about anybody'
Exactly! Because it was Pres. Obama, they want to repeal when all they have to do is tweak it a bit. EGO
it would not have worked if they had a plan and they did it would end up on HReids desk and not let it b voted on.
@Willie_American @SenateGOP So when are Democrats going to stand up to the GOP bullies? Start fighting stop trembling
PLEASE PLEASE examine Rep Tom Price (HHS nominee)!!   ETHICS!!!!!!!
@TheDemocrats @SenateGOP that's what you think!!!
One of the the problems of the Affordable Care Act is that it is a one size fits all solution.
And they'll repeal before they ever create such a plan. Republicans make so much sense.
How's that high deductible working for you? Has your plan paid out yet?
@ScottNevins @SenateGOP on top of that they want to defund planned parenthood so women's healthcare is obliterated. Disgusting
planned abortionhood?.. defund ?..absolutely.. why should we be forced to pay for murder?..
women have a right to choose. Men shouldn't choose for them.
@sactolawyer @SenateGOP will you attend inauguration?
@TheDemocrats @SenateGOP neither did obuma
GOP corrupts the bill but it passes; vow it will fail, their hope; It doesn't, so repeal! Civil servants? I think not!
you lie pocahontas!  the gop have 9 different plans!
@TheDemocrats @SenateGOP the GOP plan is to make slaves of the American people by destroying health care reform. Lying GOP!
that's because the ACA is their plan
@Gov4Sale @SenateGOP ACA. Dems should've done this from the beginning which was too allow the public 2 buy Heath Ins in any state
@Gov4Sale @SenateGOP The GOP sat up on the Insanity Hill with thumbs up asses spinning doing nothing on fixing the problems with
Anything is better than gov't run healthcare. Rising costs, taxing people poor care.
I have a plan but no one will listen to me. I can help save 100's of billions noe without cutting a benfit.
Since when is repealing that slop, not a plan?
That's about right
@JRehling @SenateGOP they dont live in our shoes they dont see or even care to see how the other half lives so why make a new 1.
@JRehling @SenateGOP they loved the old plan theirs that is. As long as their world was fine thats all that mattered .
Lazy hypocrisy
@MeMySylvanEye @SenateGOP you tell them Elizabeth!
Stay true Elizabeth We need that now more than ever.
they never will. Already back peddling. Only repeal part. SCHEISTERS
True !
what health insurance plan do you have Senator Warren?
@ErinMcBride @SenateGOP Urine therapy is the plan. Clearly.
ACA is unsustainable as is. Rushed through by Dems. Fail. Repair begins 1/20/17
the only plan they had was to cut almost everyone off. Then watch chaos for the remainder of their term. #rebellion
.@SenWarren @SenateGOP They don't have a clue either!

Here ya go Liz:
They were never planning on replacing the Affordable Care Act to begin with.
More crap and garbage from Lizzy. She has few followers, and appears to be a failed Politician Hack. She is Irrelevant and Obscure.Go away
repealing #Obamacare is not the answer.
They never will hv a plan. They are just "killing us slowly". Esp the poor who can't afford anything else
literally what I've been saying the last 2 weeks. Great to hear someone in leadership pointing this out.
Make that 30+ years.  They didn't like the Clinton plan either and NEVER came up with anything but The Free Market!
thank you for this. @SenateGOP seriously, you don't have a plan... You've had years to prepare. Unacceptable!
the discussion on the #Senate floor today was disheartening #ReplaceThenRepeal #disintermediation #DoYourJob
Liawatha.. go home. you have zero credibility, and the people have spoken. You are self serving lost soul.
- The "repUGHliCON" party of "No!" is essentially a soulless group of treasonous obstuctionist, corporate shills.
@TheDemocrats  do NOT stop their disaster.    Let them repeal Obamacare.  Give the people what they want.  Then see..
Unfortunately no one is surprised by this and their cobstituants don't seem to care.
ishkie makwayloo tetonka
land of big sky have big problem
Universal health care is the answer...
Perhaps they will go for a single payer system, regulating prices for drugs, and taking hospitals private? @SenateGOP
@LaurenHolly @shepersky @younglivingmm  @realDonaldTrump  senator Warren they still don't have anything, to replace it
They DO have a plan! The @SenateGOP plan was presented on the floor of the House a few years ago by @AlanGrayson  DIE QUICKLY!
Their plan is "they don't care, they've got theirs" plan.
Yes! I both sell and use #Obamacare. Best thing for working families. #CongressFail if #Repubs repeal.
Because they needed to control all three branches! Duh! In 8yrs what work have you done to fix it?
@jrwade1955 @SenateGOP the plan is NOT this SUCKY OBAMACARE, what do u have for insurance
@jrwade1955 @SenateGOP What on EARTH did we DO before King Obamacare?!?!  It's like none of us ever had it before 
@jrwade1955 @SenateGOP just because they were RIGHTFULLY complaining doesn't mean they have been working on replacement.
That's because they know they're going to have to keep developing the AHCA.
.@SenWarren @MattMurph24 @SenateGOP 4 Warren 2 work a Thief n liar she has to be dishonest #Hillary #Trump #love #cute #tbt #me #followme #
They haven't even been at work long enough to work on one. They only work around 111 days a year. Do nothing Congress!
Poco why do you lie so much Obamacare=Financial Death for regular people
Meanwhile in those 8 yrs, how many 18 y.o. kids became 26 w/8 years of healthcare NO GOP PLAN EVER gave them? #ACA
current ACA has many flaws. Should have let insurance co's compete across state lines. Workers premiums up. Incl. Mine
That's because their ONLY plan has been to OBSTRUCT, OBSTRUCT, OBSTRUCT for 96 long MONTHS
surprise!  No plan is their plan.
great point! No plan because it's not priority to ensure ppl but to destroy Dem legacy. Quite callus and evil
how can this woman ever be trusted to tell the truth.
That's because the GOP has is not the party "for" anything. It's easier to scapegoat than actually be constructive.
Called my @SenatorBurr asking to see plan. My sister will lose all chance of cover if ACA repealed. She will die.
Surprise surprise  they do
speak of each part of the constitution as you protest so we can learn the civics.
Aren't you a Senator? No reason for you to get involved. You're only a Senator.
I understand it could take 3 years to come up with a replacement. Talk about being asleep at the wheel.
Thank you for speaking truth to these hypocrites, Senator. #notmypresident
That's because it was quite useful to use as motivation to get their ignorant and uninformed voters to the polls.
Republican healthcare plan: don't get sick. If you do get sick, die quickly.
Haters gonna hate! GO SENATOR SESSIONS!
sure they do. Don't get sick and if you do, die fast.
Because it's hard to develop a decent plan; it's  easier to poke holes, pick & choose areas that are weak; fix it GOP
"THEY" is you now. Not some obscure group of others. We need action from you, not a lecture.
seems to me that that in and of itself is a plan.
Why is it so hard for you to see that ACA is a complete failure?
As a Senator can you co-sponsor a Bill with Senator Sanders to adopt a Medicare system for all? Single payer.
WHINER
20 million supposedly helped by Obamacare but 290 million were definitely hurt. Your support of the disaster in unwelcome.
sounds to jealousy!!!!! #1President!
Who does?
Their plan is only to negate everything Obama did.
and now will spend more time and tax payers money on repeal and replace..well except for Trump since he pays no taxes.
No hearings without proper vetting....please!
, and we all have 0% confidence that @SenateGOP ever will
ammend the damn ACA. What kind of moron builds a new house when all you need is to paint a room. Dbl dog dare @SenWarren
@TheDemocrats @Senate  you are so right all GOP wants to do is disgrace Pres Obama as usual
The Rep will never have a viable plan, they just want to defame President Obama in any way they can. Keep fighting for us!!!!
we got 8 more years to figure it out. RELAX.
.@SenWarren @SenateGOP’s plan is to regress back to healthcare for only the healthy & wealthy, repealing  is the first step #revealb4repeal
Please vote no on Sessions
and you and your colleagues voted for a bill you didn't read and still don't understand! But you exempt yourselves!
Actually, they do.  Maybe you should talk to @RandPaul once in a while.
Warren only Dems voted for the plan that no one read. In Nancy's words We need to pass it to see how it works".
@robdelaney @SenateGOP insurance companies dictate Healthcare, that's the real problem.
Do not let them destroy the ACA.
if Obama care goes, so Does the GOP!!!
Bullshit.
Pocahontas speaks
@EaleyGregory @SenateGOP #AMEN!!!
And you don't have a clue. Your party lost, get over it, get out of the way and let the big boys start the rebuilding
You mean they actually should do some work? Making a difference requires it. I think they just want a paycheck.
@robdelaney @SenateGOP it feels like they planned to complain without a replacement so they could get elected AND keep it.
if the American people smarten up we can change all that into years
well that's typical
Democrats came up with plans to help US citizens: Social Security, Medicare & Plans B & D (with nays from most GOP).
@dmcrane @SenateGOP they know how to win elections but do not know how to govern.
their only plan is destruction and greed.
Do the democrats have a plan yet about losing those 1,000 seats around the country or still being hypocritical?
@TheDemocrats @SenateGOP I believe this is a falsehood. I do believe what I have heard from #GOP that multiple plans are here.
@robdelaney @SenateGOP Senator, you should come out with your plan to improve the ACA. I know it'd be symbolic at this point...
@TheDemocrats @SenateGOP yes, they do
@COLTENISM @SenateGOP 
do unto others. Sue over ex orders protest every bill. Enforce the constitution to every word.Jam foia
their horrible they want to kill it I hope they lose all their seats in 2 yrs
@TheDemocrats @SenateGOP the Democrats have spent 8 years doing nothing but destroying America. Then wonder why they lost.
they never imagined they'd win and actually get to do it 
@TheDemocrats @SenateGOP Yeah well, health care is not governments job.
We KNOW the plan YOU FORCED on us is a FAILURE! Go get your coloring book Pocahontas!
no disrespect,your number should have said "16"yrs,Busch adm had "8"yrs also.no need too go back any further,we get it they don't
I believe they are now getting nervous. I've contacted my representative and Senators. Tried calling Ryan,line's busy.
Liar!!!
@TheDemocrats @SenateGOP Hi Pocahontas's! Maybe you can be African next time! You're a proven liar. Why listen to you! Go away!
What if they plan to rename ACA #Trumpcare.  He'll get 20m new followers.  Good for his ego.  And 20m get healthcare!
-Republican Plan:Repeal Obamacare,Privatize/Voucherize Medicare,VA. Block Grant Medicaid. Reform(cut) Social Security.

And the only plan you have is tell those that will litsen,LOOK AT ME IM TALKING,LOOK AT ME IM COMPLAINING.
I have spent yrs complaining of your theft of scholarship $$ from the Cherokee. RETURN IT
keep fighting!  We're with you.
you do not tell the truth...what about all those amendments they proposed and you wouldn't discuss
How about buy your own insurance? That's what normal people do.
@TheDemocrats @SenateGOP there is no plan the med insurance industry paid for ACA repeal & no plan & they'll get it
The liberal-left is still lying. 6 years to fix Obamacare and nothing done.
It's probably in the same place your plan for sub prime predatory lenders is.
keep after them
because it is hard to replace something that should have never been
The @SenateGOP have spent 8 yrs complaining about hlth care reform. But after 8 yrs of complaining, they still don’t have a plan.
A bad plan (#ACA) is still a plan. Right #lyingliz?
#Warren is the new #Raid. #givingdopesavoice
I like the GOPs chances better compared to the Dems track record for past 8 years !
@reevynap @SenateGOP A Complaint is not a Plan and a Complainer is not a Fixer
@jimmyj48125 @SenateGOP They do. Their plan is to offer nothing and exclude millions of Americans from receiving healthcare..
Planning is hard!
@LoriHannah58 @SenateGOP Elizabeth..you're my hero!
@margaritarr8 @SenateGOP Oh they've got a plan Sen. Warren...KEEP the plan get RID of the Obama Legacy part. 2 many $$$ involved
Nope, and they never will. Repukes are only interested in stuffing their wallets.
Another lie for Warren.  http://www.cnbc.com/id/104209333  http://www.cnbc.com/id/104209333 
They did that with everything the Democrats put forward. Supreme Court? Now they want those Democrats to toe the line
@margaritarr8 Yes we know & just campaign rhetoric for trump.
everyone knew this, if there was better, Obama would have happily implemented it...
@TheDemocrats @SenateGOP Absurd comment! You passed ACA and Obama defended. Trump is not yet President and you claim " no plan "?
good point. The ACA has issues but at least it was a start.
SW we are with you! We are counting on you to fight with all ur heart! We are here to help!
#TheResistance
@ehwilk @SenateGOP because they haven't worked out taxes paid for the GOP being on vacation 
Stop complaining about the GOP.  Use that energy to plan for the future!
@DanScavino Dems must think it's fine as NO plans put forth to improve... oh that's rt U have separate plan...
Incredible. If they'd spent 8 years working instead of grandstanding, they might have something legitimate to unveil.
