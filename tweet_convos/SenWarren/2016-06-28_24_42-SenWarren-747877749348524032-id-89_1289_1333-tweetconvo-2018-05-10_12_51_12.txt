@BverInFL They're always sneaking in their "riders" to undermine voter safety - I guess they don't think pesticides will hurt GOP
.@NightShade10 @SenWarren Yes. I've always said that if their policies r so great, y do they always have 2sneak them into bills!
yep! LoL
Ooh sorry, can't believe a word you say anymore. Next
@WNC4Bernie @SenWarren
This is the backlash of having DT as the frontrunner poison the well for everyone, GOP style. It will take more than a sit in.
@llstudent08 This why they can't be trusted! Vote them out!
#ProDeathGOP!!!
@belledame222 i don't know how pesticides in our drinking water would help kill mosquitos even if its weren't a major carcinogen?
Someone needs to put a stop to these bills having totally unrelated things attached to them.
Well, I never vote GOP, so won't ne a problem for me to not vote for them! :D
what about #Ebola
The crafty GOP is like some creepy secret society writing bills loaded with their selfish pig picking parties, always selfish...

@KarenRegis That's okay, I'm sure the fracking chemicals will overpower the pesticides. #FrackHillary #FrackTheSoldoutDNC

@p447 Republicans said a few years ago they will do NOTHING except take a paycheck from AMERICANS..its the only TRUTH they spoke!
@ruckawriter Even tho those pesticides v. poorly control Zika vector. DDT is compound nearly wiped out female Ae. aegypti in US.
@Archivist1000 Crocodile tears. #Hillary's Campaign Advisor is Jerry Crawford of most evil corp #Monsanto

@fritchee We all know GOP want to do away w/ any http://regulations.GOP  don't care if ur water is poisioned.
hey, hows that dem controlled EPA doing with the Flint michigan water issue??
That is her job. Politicians talk. I suppose Elizabeth could spend time vindicating Hillary on Benghazi AGAIN like Reps!
why do want to poison us @PRyan why do you hate us so? @livenewscloud
too bad you're stuck under Clinton's thumb. Youda might had a shot! But as long as u stand with Clinton, I want no part of you!
do they want to destroy the earth? Such blatant disregard for life, besides their own.
Interestingly, pesticides may actually be the cause of microcephaly, not ZikaV. https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160624150813.htm …
The problem is there is spending on domestic causes for Democrats and never enough spending on the military for republicans.
Sickening: Warren is ok with kill Zika babies in the womb, but not ok with killing Zika mosqitoes w/ pesticides @HeimishCon
The amount of twisting and misinformation Warren propaganda produces is sickening.
once you supported Clinton, who makes GOP look like the JV team, you proved you're fake.
and the vote was still too close. We need to elect more democrats into congress
WHAT?!
Can we get rid of Republicans in Nov, please?
What does keeping industrial poisonous run off out of our waters got 2 do with infected mosquitoes?
shameful...as usual
and it's a scam: that type of mosquito control is damn near useless against Zika. @knittingknots

Why you are creating diversion tactics away from Prez nominees. One with hawkish regime change policies have caused 300K+ death.
Isn't human value across all continents with all ethnic and religious backgrounds same?
this is why our country so desperately needs you!
because who needs clean water, right?
Your critiques carry a lot less weight since you endorsed a pro-fracking, anti-carbon tax neoliberal corporatist.
Me like pesticides in my moonshine. Me republican
the GOP working against Americans
People in Louisiana are still waiting for help from hurricane Katrina that the gov promised.  Put that in your peace pipe.
Republican governors/state legislators also pushed back on the Clean Water Act to placate powerful Ag interests.
Thank you for interjecting depth and insight into the argument. You're a credit to your party.
OBGYNS are now free to practice their love with women all over the country
Of course it does. Shameful.  KEEP ON FIGHTING, SEN. WARREN! Don't listen to the ridiculous insults. I'm totally behind you.
Trump/Farage 2016
GOP poison well. Time to break out stolen recipe from Pow Wow Chow.
@HillaryClinton Foundation donors got @StateDept access. Hey H, how many bribes did you take for access?
What a brilliant point. Fuck the drinking water! Let's focus on what's important, Titiana.
