It's a violation of the First Amendment too.
how exactly is limiting foreigners that have no US constitutional right a violation of 1st amend?
Banning Muslims while increasing the number of Christians is a violation of the1st Amendment. You should check it out some time
you know the 1st amendment is free speech right??? That has literally nothing to do with this
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;"
it's not specific to a religion. It's specific to countries and the immigration from those countries...
It's a Muslim ban. That is a religion. Are you truly that stupid? Never mind, Nazis are that stupid. Meanwhile Piss Off.
I agree in this case, but Warren's stance on second amendment puts her in the same camp as Trump. Check your values, Warren.
Check values? She values people over guns. Not sure of the problem!
So you do not believe in the constitution? What specifically about "shall not infringe" do you struggle with?
I don't believe waiting periods and tighter background checks are infringements.
Neither do I. I support both measures passionately. Warren is a proponent of bans, sir. Documented everywhere.
.@gcarlson582 @mikefridley @OneRogueUnicorn Fake quote,picture from Oprah Winfrey in mid 80s.Nice try! #TruthZone #Trump2020 #QuoteFail 
What is it that you want her to do? It's an executive order& we're minority.
executive orders have to be Constitutional, Senators, idk, are fucking SENATORS
And the majority are red!! How many thousands read that tweet? We r coalition!
and? This isn't fucking farm subsidy legislation, get some perspective
No kidding. Don't change subject. None of you had a sensible answer. Be real.
we are you being obtuse?
Why are you asking? Clearly I understand & support her tweets. How obtuse is that?
he brings shame to this country
Wake up you joker. Obama has shamed this great nation for 8 flipping years. Time to get it back
All Trump's lies about Obama will never destroy his legacy. He hates how great Obama is and Trump will never be that great!
You talk about racism! Obama is the biggest racist! Muslim for that matter! Cared nothing about America and failed America!
A betrayal of (((American Values)))
notice they are not being settled in Mass. Obama sent them out west.
he's also a betrayal of a president.
ABOUT TIME!!
President Obama's record proves how great he was. Its sickening hearing Trump constantly lie about Pres Obama!
It may also be unconstitutional.
like that German leader who banned a specific ethnicity and religion? The best intentions, I'm sure. #Resist
that was temporary (still didn't care for it), not an edict
no. I didn't miss any of the ignorance and bigotry he spewed. That's why I will never support him
were you personally there at his speeches or was it fox propaganda?

finish the quote.."to build a wall to keep our people in." We are not doing that.
notice alt-right can completely ignore facts and Drumpf's own words?
The Dem party of 55 yrs ago is NOT the same as now!
and the Repugnantcans today are nothing like the noble GOP of the past.
what's amusing is Trump is basically trying to undo the Nixon legacy
When Sen Warren returns the $350,000 to Harvard for lying, come talk to me about NOBLE politicians
considering the Chinese exclusion act, I don't think your right. It's a horrible idea, but it's not a surprise
did not read US History, rather he must have read Hitler's "Mein Kampf"!!! #ResistTrump
we keep letting them in and we will have no American values.
Tell that to Angela Merkel Pochantis.
We turned away Jews in 39 & now Muslims. God help us.
Christians are terrorists too- kkk?!? DIVERSITY IS GREAT.
When was the last KKK terrorist attack?   @realDonaldTrump
wow are you defending the kkk?
As bad as the KKK is they aren't blowing people up like Islamic terrorists! @LoveRunandPray @realDonaldTrump
or blowing up Police Stations like Bill Ayers at al Obama buddies
delusional sheep. You've been gaslighted.
I feel helpless. @realDonaldTrump on course to destroy our democracy. A sad time for America. #fightinequality  #SOS #standunited
First lesson..We are a #ConstitutionalRepublic
Not a 
#Democracy.    look it up!
“Government by the people, exercised either directly or through elected representatives” not mincing words. Saidwhatimean
talk is cheap.  I thought you were one of the strong ones.  Not any longer.  Resist with your actions,  not words.
you + the dems voting for all of his nominees is a betrayal of American values
I agree! voting for his henchmen to serve your own agenda is deplorable
@emmykinney @realDonaldTrump Senstor Warren, please, you are a woman of great intelligence and honesty, and power. Help us!
You should protest by continuing to vote for his cabinet picks.
No . . No it isn't and I find you offensive.  We have a right and responsibilty to know who we are letting in.
warren u are nuts
Orlando shooter and San Bernardino shooters were refugees brought in. I guess shooting up the place constitutes US Values? #crazy
The Orlando shooter was US born. San Bernadine make Was US born, wife here on fiancée visa. None were "refugees"
1 out of 3.
I'm not trying to be specific. Radical Islam, sir...say it with me now.
You're backing policy that wouldn't have done a thing to help against those attacks.
Those specific attacks true. Individuals who have been Radicalized can be prevented from legally entering with policy
I assume the #dems are filing a lawsuit tomorrow to stop this EO. @SenWarren @LOLGOP @realDonaldTrump
Thank God someone is trying 2 protect America from enemies abroad who would not only take our jobs but our lives
Then I guess Carter, Clinton and Obama all betrayed those values too.
He has invoked a religious test. Isn't that against the Constitution, Senator?
Read the damn order. It say nothing about Moslems or religious tests. Your a liar
your mission from this day forward should be to impeach him!
You have to be intentionally ignorant to believe Pres Obama did a bad job for 8 years. FACTS PROVE HE SAVED USA!
yeah,he's a shitwig alright @LOLGOP @realDonaldTrump
@emmykinney @realDonaldTrump please find a way to get the money-monger Fake Trump out of our House before he destroys our Nation!
Im all for E Pluribus Unum-Liberty-we are the worlds beacon-im for our values-we need to check ourselves
that's true
Having any sort of religious test is an affront to decent people, and an insult to the founding fathers.
Try reading the 1952 immigration law that Obama violated, its a matter of allegiences
so get him out of there. Call for a full impeachment

Rscist @realDonaldTrump Bigot
Antichrist @POTUS
#trump grow up,behave like a president.Stop lying and cheating American http://people.You  know you lost popular vote.
@VicenteFoxQue When are you dopes going to get over this popular vote BS. You are the racist!
After his investigation proves voter fraud won popular vote
@vote301617 @johnnybgood1959 @Macheter0 @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @VicenteFoxQue
@bherylann @realDonaldTrump - I disagree!!! We need 2 get a handle on these terrorists in country- have you seen dead bodies???
But their parents were and their religious leaders were
If its a muslim ban , then why not include the other 46 muslim countries ?????
were you asleep when he said "America first"?
It's un-American and barbaric. Why don't we just give the Statue of Liberty back to France already?!
no Senator it is great to have a POTUS that cares about the safety of our citizens. People like you disconnected
we continue to thank this Senator for continuing to remind us why we voted for Donald Trump. Keep it up please!
@sydneemcelroy And on Holocaust Remembrance Day.

This isn’t my America.
Not all Muslim countries. Excluded ones @realDonaldTrump has business with; coincidentally ones where 9/11 terrorists came from.
when do we march for them?  I'll b there!!
@russbengtson @realDonaldTrump stop voting to confirm his fucking appointees
No it's not! Please retake a US Government and Civics class.No reason for anyone not to go thru the legal process to enter the US
You don't get to tell us how we feel anymore. We tell you. And we want this. That is why we voted for him.
agreed
But she voted for Ben Carson- who does not believe Muslims have constitutional rights....
Excellent point. @SenWarren must answer for every @realDonaldTrump nominee she supports.
We have a mentally unstable man signing executive orders. Where is the GOP conscience? Are there no sane or decent party members?
@ErinConrad2 @realDonaldTrump as if this wasn't bad enough by itself, doing it on holocaust Remembrance Day is a travesty
Do you still represent MA? How about we focus on poor kids in the United States? Where is the money for Syrians?
you might want to read 8USC1182.
What are you and other #SenateDems going to do? @moonalli @realDonaldTrump
Shall we let every1 know where she lives since she generously WELCOMES them 4 shelter&will feed them all?
with all due respect, US first
then American values must change with the times. Get your heads out of the sand, ISIS forced this, not Trump!
remember 9/11, sanberno, Orlando, Boston, Ohio Remember whom you have sworn to protect and serve
not mine!  @realDonaldTrump has the backs of the American people! #KeepAmericaSafe #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
@DanScavino HORSEFEATHERS
@Busyphilipps25 @realDonaldTrump Thank the geniuses that voted him in!
na it's not
no it's taking care of the US first!Take care of our homeless "refugee" citizens before taking on anyone else's
we can't take care of our own veterans but we're supposed to take in people who would be a burden?
what's wrong with America first and making sure OUR vets and children are fed and sheltered?
Newsflash Ms. Pant Suit....you don't speak for American Values. Get over yourself.
Today is #HolocaustMemorialDay. I am appalled & ashamed. This is how it begins. Zachor, Remember & Never Forget!
Dear senator 
What serious actions are you and fellow Democrats going to do to fix this? #muslimban
@BelkissObadia @realDonaldTrump Well he chose countries that don't fill his pockets. Trump loves the color green
No, it isn't. It is sound policy. You've obviously never served in a combat zone and had to engage Hajj. I have.
Excuse us! Who's fighting to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain U might want to put our country 1st B4 rapugees??
@LOLGOP @realDonaldTrump
#SenatorWarren the problem is drump doesn't have any values When will someone begin #impeachment proceedings
Stopping legal residents at OHare!  Legal residents, not temporary visas, not refugees.  People who live here!!
is it even legal for him to do that?!
Bernie would have won
And furthermore not one of the terrorists since 9/11 including 9/11 us from any of the countries banned?!??
No!! It's a safeguard of those very values!  What kind of intellect is this crap you keep putting out?
Typical liberal - wants to put politics in front of American's safety, then force tax payers to pay for it.
@nycjim Give me your tired, your poor Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free...Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me
Continue in grace and fury my hero!
I'm most terrified to imagine what it will be like, after Trump's SCOTUS nominee is sitting on the bench.
see everyone at Detroit Metro tomorrow. The resistance starts now, in the streets
Elizabeth when each member of congress starts providing them a room in their own homes then we can talk.
It is not, it's the law. Try reading it some time. @realDonaldTrump
Does "The South" care?
you mean like life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for our CITIZENS?
Plus, this discriminative EO  plays right into the hands of ppl who love to hate America.
Isn't it ironic that we're hearing "Right to Life" speeches" same time these orders are going out?
Note that Muslim countries that he has business interests in are A-OK. Life in #Trumplandia #ConflictOfInterest
not properly vetting a possibly allowing pplnin this country to kill us is the real "betrayal". Restrict away!
don't forget he excluded the Muslim-majority countries where he has business ties! #notmypresident
Tell me more about how many terrorists have attacked us from the countries he's banned.
He is protecting us. But lying about your race to gain preferential treatment IS a betrayal of American values.
No it is not  it is necessary at this time, and only temporary
no I think it's brilliant
It is what the majority of Americans want.  That is why Trump won!!!
And so I assume you will be voting against anything & everything (or e/one) that embodies betrayal of USA values, right?? Right??
but not the ones from oil rich countries.   Now that's a double standard 
Letting in a group of people knowing a small percentage are terrorist murderers is UNAMERICAN.
@jackmackenroth @realDonaldTrump @RSizensky Not even you are that stupid, although...
...while excluding countries where he has interests...
those values have been more of a myth for a very long time. People want actions,not words that mean nothing.
Warren you have betrayed the people that out u in office. u don't understand American values. Time for u to go
its sad its come this far-times are extremely 1 bad decision away- a moratorium-we admit clean hands and legally
Fight the good fight and stand for refugees!
Sorry Sen Warren, I disagree.
Still trying to get over you pretending to be an Indian. This is a ban on countries with terrorists Oh Muslims
you support his cabinet, you support him
For realz. Even progressives aren't doing the right thing. We're screwed. Thanks for selling out my country @SenWarren . #resist
#ResistandRebel

Reply to @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump You don't know much about  citizens values, do you??  We don't want terrorists in this nation or Sharia
Remembering YOUR WORDS today:  "If you don't have a seat at the table, then you're on the menu."
to bad she does not value AMERICAN lives over Islamic radical terrorists.
why is it wrong to protect your country, community, and citizens? Why do you choose their interests over USA?
what can I do to help stop this madness!
Pure BS, from a very ugly person.
LIZ this is how Mexico defends its southern. It's the right thing  to build a wall & FREEZE refugee program
@MattMurph24 @realDonaldTrump Notice there is no ban on the COUNTRIES he holds business' in, since being elected? DT's TAXES?
, Your attempt to redefine my values is the height of arrogance. BTW how tall are you??? Asking for a friend @realDonaldTrump
No it's not...keep trying, Fauxahontas.
he is only enforcing the laws Obama put in 2011. Remember that law??  Where was your protest back then? ????
he conveniently left off any Muslim countries where he owns property.
Senator Warren We The People implore you to impeach this mad man before he starts with the nukes.
.@SenWarren @jerichobrown if the order banning refugees were a nominee, you'd vote for it.
And @realDonaldTrump suggesting a variation on the Nürnberger Gesetze for vetting is chilling.
Thank you, Sen. Warren!
NOT
Agreed.  Plus most of the 9/11 hijackers came from Saudi Arabia and he did not restrict immigrants from there!!
Then please DO SOMETHING about it! The Dems are nowhere to be found! Stick up for the people you represent and resist or impeach
Warren needs to get a life, hell she's worse than Hillary & that's "REAL BAD" .
I disagree. She's as good as Hillary. @SenWarren is standing up for what she believes & who support her. @realDonaldTrump
I remember something in the constitution about freedom of religion, or was that a suggestion?
You don't dictate what my American values are, nor did Obama.
- Wow-what have we become in one week?  A nation bolting its doors because it can't face truth? @CNN @nytimes
remember when we were winning the war in iraq and the terrorists were on their heals... then we pulled out. Thank obama.
. @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump America is now a Christian Pence Theocracy! Radical Christian Terrorists!
Your so-called "American values" are YOUR narrow, progressive values that have never governed this country.
Obama started all of this,didn't follow really safe vetting,could be your family killed next
Hmm the 9/11 people were from Saudi. That's not on the list and what abt Afanganistan.. not them either really??
notice not all Muslim countries only certain ones that he doesn't have investments in!
so senWarren has the AMERICAN justice system ever convicted an innocent person? If so should we...........
Go on over and visit the Middle East, and go love you some Muslims. Let us know how that works out for you.
Some values can be auto-destructive.
YOU and all those that share your ideologies have betrayed AMERICANS.
You don't belong here anymore.
Go away.
it's a tragedy and a travesty.
Sadly, you & your 'Democrat' collegues endorsing his #SwampCabinet doesn't help any of those 'American Values' #DoSomething
then y are u & everyone else in our govt letting him do as he pleases? When r u guys going 2 stand up, say no & fight for ur ppl?
it's a great thing! Your a liberal snowflake that's allowing people to come here and destroy our values!
What do you care about "American values"? Dems violate that every day just by existing. @realDonaldTrump
so what are you going to do about it?
it's amazing that a person in ur position can be so ignorant. Get outside some. Enough. @realDonaldTrump
. @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump The plaque at the base of the Statue of Liberty reads: "Give me (cont) http://tl.gd/nnde2p 
so you want what you want and you want it now - won't work  Be patient Be part of the solution- not the problem!
He'll let good people in. He's so compassionate. Please fight hard against him Senator. Don't back down.
@IndivisibleAV
Except no restrictions on countries where he is making money or will soon be making money.
#resist #withholdconsent
so what can we do about it? It's time to act
what do ISIS, Al Qaeda, and the Taliban have in common? Hmmmmmmm......
Sure. EW your a fake and a phony
@TheLeftsRight And WHO is stopping him!? WHO Senator Warren?! This has to stop now, but its You, & Sanders & WHOELSE? #RESIST
you will be replaced in 2018.  @realDonaldTrump keep making America great @SenWarren an enemy of the state that failed Americans.
Up yours, Pocahontas!
@emmykinney @realDonaldTrump waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
God bless you for standing up to the inhumane #MuslimBan and standing up for true American values @schemaly @realDonaldTrump
What Muslim ban
?   See the 1952 immigration law about Conflict of Allegiences.
.what will he do to atheists. We dont do. Well in theocracies
Lizzy, you are WAY out of touch with REAL AMERICAN values! It's why you like libs have lost the election!
