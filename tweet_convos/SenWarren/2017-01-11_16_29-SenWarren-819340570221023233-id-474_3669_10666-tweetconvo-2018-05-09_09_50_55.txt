I'd encourage IMPEACHMENT as soon as he takes the oath!
@stephsanola @SenWarren Then we get Pence.
I don't like that any better than you. We got royally screwed this election.
Yes we did.Pence would screw us domestically, but maybe not internationally as much as Trump.
Pence would be nightmare on SCOTUS. With Trump, he might zig or zag or Ivanka might influence himWISH?
Pence would be a nightmare, agreed. trump is catering to the far right though, conviction or not. Bad news
I believe the whole thing is a nightmare created by the 92.6 Mil who stayed home from the polls,
shame on everyone who allowed this to happen. Especially those who don't care enough to be informed & vote.
The ENTIRETY of Donald Trump puts us all at risk. #STOPTheInauguration Seriously, he's dangerously unfit.
it time to stop !! Obama put our country at risk . Give him a chance to repair 8 yrs
Delusional. Obama brought us BACK. What utter nonsense. Where do these ppl come from? WTF?
ok if that is what u think but it truly shows u and the haters are very small minded . So u are a nobody with a small brain
I think the word you're looking for is...
that is your opinion you know u have another option MOVE!!!! Mexico and Canada are close So get to packing
You first, comrade.
not going any where staying here and helping our President to fight for us You hate him you hate what our country stands for
This man MUST be impeached!!!! Be relentless and use the justice system to accomplish this!!!
you live in a 5 million house your net worth puts you with the 1% maybe that's why you don't want change
how is it that Congress allows DT to get away with all these violations against the Constitution
how is it that Trump's son-in-law is able to be in the WH when the constitution disallows it.
He has no idea what this job is all about & thinks he's been elected KING!
Terror attack on Trump name would be SO tempting to the types who choose high-profile targets.
Risk from what? Afraid he'll cheat us out of the toys in the Cracker Jacks?
Why???
And yet, we are powerless to stop him. #FascismInAmerica
Are we?
What do you propose, luv? Oh, right. Phone calls.
That's just the beginning  Believe me, as an old warrior, we will change things
Your lips to God's ear
yes it does. Why are you going to inauguration pretending this is normal. It's not.
I can't even answer you I have never liked anything you said  No let's make the 1% richer people like u
Does he honestly expect us to believe he won't speak to his sons about his business dealings?
Doesn't even matter whether @realDonaldTrump discusses it, he knows what he owns. His every policy creates a conflict.
@DeanLeh @realDonaldTrump @POTUS and he will get away with it which is far worse then HRC emails!  My goodness GOP is corrupt!
Warren, how does ANY of Prez DJT's financial matters put ur over-inflated ego at risk????
He already is #MAGA. Quit your whining.
what did Kennedy, and FDR do?
Sen. Warren, just bide your time.  Abuse of power is grounds for impeachment.  But you need Republican support, right?
Yea you clowns are so ethical and law abiding! LOL
enough of the delusional BS
Thank U Sen.Warren & others w/backbone! Trump is a threat to R Nat'l Security!
- too bad you Democrats have no clue what it takes to start a business or run a business
How, idiot? Did you push for #Hillary to divest the Clinton Foundation? NO! She funneled $$$ for rigged election
help us sen warren god help us sen sanders god help us all.
Real BILLIONAIRES know the only people who make money on a Mortgage is the BANKERS!!!
By the way real BILLIONAIRES don't have Mortgages on anything they don't pay INTEREST cash only!
Trustee's usual sell.. everything TRUMP owns has a fat Mortgage on it.. Mortgage holder would be paid first..wiping out TRUMP!
*Huge sigh* something we all know. Keep your own house straight.
It will be a GREAT day for America when MA elects new young dynamic person to take your senate seat!
with high quality brandnanme that has already proven safe.. .  these pills are not the way they are now
we have to go back to original way patent protections were with high saftey standards
trump wants to so you have that in common so please workto gether not against him
us sick.. help trump help us that iswhy we elected him. but warren stop these poisons
the risk is in our medicines that corrupt politicians  are paid to by pharma to keep these
you are a nice lady and i admire your go fight at ceo wells fargo step down but the
why don't you work on that threat that has been in affect alreay 8 years.poisoning me.
we need high standard brandname patent patient protection back.. why don't you look
now why don't you make a law to stop pharma payin corrupt politicians keeping us sick?
I don't think he has a problem with that ms warren.. But why do you need to go off on him?
Our country is about to become nothing more than Trump's  next business acquisition.
Don't forget about De Vos & her 600+ corporate ownerships, most in the homeschool industry. It a tangled web they weave...
@Angela2932 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Are you going to help us??
you must not be current with what's going on.
so did Cheney. You voted to give his company the contract in Iraq. You are so hypocritcal
What are you so jealous of... The President should be allowed to protect his life's work. We don't care!
Toubput us at risk because of your extreme weakness. You think your smart! The rest of the world thinks your weakening America
Its unethical to pretend to be native-American Indian to make a profit @SenWarren !
@twinsational @realDonaldTrump @POTUS To take and deny gov assistance to its citizens is shameful. Those who do it need a Dr. ACA
yeah maybe he can have a litle money since he gave up his salary as president! you are sick, sick
we are all massively at risk!! My America has been hijacked!
Lizy don't u think Obama has an ongoing nest egg & what about Clinton foundation nice little gravy train?
He has no moral compass. He will always choose his business and his image over the rest of America. #Divest
@Cnn @AC360
He won, let it go!
@MAHAMOSA @realDonaldTrump @POTUS 
There is nothing to stop them. No conscience to appeal to. Pure unmitigated hate and greed.
Like what the Clintons did?!
// E Warren is a straight crook// So sorry for your hurt feelings & so biased opinions #Karma-IS-Real!!
@skinnyminny1953 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Ms Elizabeth I Hope You're Watching This  HORROR OF A #SpeakerRyanTownHall! It's AWFUL!
you can say that again
@zizii2 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS it's government intervention, republican style.
Make him sell! Make him sell!. If he don't will be a lame duck before inaugaration. Wont be trusted?
a socialist like you puts us all at risk. Saying your native American put us at risk...
he will always do whatever he wants, for his own God. I'm so discouraged.
not real sure what this risk is.
No its not. It's American. There's nowhere cancan put his money that would make you happy.
@thomas3762 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS  Seems to me that you guys can't get used to the idea of a president who actually works!
Don has never done a days work in his life.
Lol, now you're showing your intelligence, dumpy. Hate to break-up this way, via text, but..
Hahahaha...another ass kisser gone! Oh maybe you are just a @goldenshower person!  Sorry didn't mean to give you credit, im sure you r lazy!
Dumbest thing I heard!!
Agree 100%
i agree. Trump is not going to work for the American people when he had outside intrests.
He tests our democracy, Senator. When the Democracts take over in 2018, we'll have laws to TRUMP HIM!
We were put at risk when he got elected. What a diabolical plan his supporters came up with. Trump is just the head of this terrible snake.
Thanks for reading this Now, @SenWarren as you have to clean up the mess from the @realDonaldTrump anyway! Be prouder procrastinater @POTUS
#ItsTrueVeryBigRisk
He doesn't care, Senator. WHEN WILL YOU RUN??? #Warren2020
@caroltpsworld @realDonaldTrump @POTUS quando si fa politica sigra bisogna esser amici solidali
and we are at risk with you in congress.. I'm with trump!!
nice try
So true! Why are so many not troubled by this?  HRC was railed for Clinton Foundation.  Stay strong, EW!
Yeah right Chicken Little. Start acting like an adult.
we demand anew ELECTION PLEASE our government &Russia took advantage of the people & there trust.
@KimberleAllen @realDonaldTrump @POTUS 
Your tenacity is appreciated.
get over your jealousy and GROW UP!!
@KimberleAllen @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
That the same as Hillary's Foundation where she was selling future favors w/"donations?" Too she bad she lost!
No it doesn't. It's better he has his own money.
it is neither unethical it is not risky. He is the only one we have ever had this wealthy so make it work
Stop talking and do something  !!
.@WLD01 @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Trump shouldn't be allowed to swear in!! He is breaking Constitutional Law!! #EmolumentsClause
Get over it.
Cuff him! #unethical #NationAtRisk
Perhaps if we just had a welfare reciepient with no assets as president then would you stop whining? #Stupidity
Being president should be a full time job and we need focus! #NoPartTimePresident
how about treasonous acts by Trump by working with Russia to get elected? Guess that doesn't matter?
Yes, pass the bill AND require nominees to provide tax returns for 10 years. Yes we want to see them!
Shouldn't EW focus on the most important issue with HUD, as in the people, and not so much DJT AND HIS PROFIT?
- Change the law if you don't like! Mr. Trump is not only following law, he's adding to Nat'l Treasury!
@kmledf2 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS since you are a career politician, you wouldn't know that. Maybe #Termlimits are in order for u.
@kmledf2 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS shut up Pocahontas, you are allowed to keep your business so you have it to go back to.
unethical, entitled member of the 1 %
for DT supporters you need more specifics on why.
so impeach him if he breaks the law.
So having an illegal private server with highly classified info on it doesn't puts us all at risk?
Will Trump enforce the laws of the U.S. regarding his own biz? The Take Care Clause
take care of himself oh yeah
What can we the people do besides make phone calls? not all of us live where marches are going on
good ?
@cjdrgg @realDonaldTrump @POTUS  trump just tweeted a promotional  tweet for LL BEAN because of their support
I wish people would also understand that just because something is legal does not mean it is ethical.
the 1% are not at risk
really... You'd prefer he become a billionaire on the backs of American people's taxes like the other politicians have done?!?!
is it against the constitution as well? That the president may make no outside monetary gain while in office.
yes, impeach him!!! ASAP
Dump trump he has his fingers in Russian Pie!
yes and if you supported Bernie that would not have mattered
Senator, you have the power to stop the orange cancer. Tweets will not do much.
AMEN! I am so glad you are in office. It eases my mind because I  know you will protect us!
Where is unethical? You need to stop the empty hot air and now it's time you take your meds.
Your failed policies put us a risk @SenWarren
impeach....
It is publicity for him and that will be $$$$$ for DJT's companies.
Head up ur ass always
so how can he be stopped?
illegal also isn't it?
The Dems and you must look in the mirror,
and this is how the electoral college voters failed.  They have no point.  Time to rid ourselves
to his followers he is god. He makes no mistakes. His words are truth. He is perfect.
djtRUMP is looking to be the richest man in the world and will not settle for any less. Will kill America
Warren you are the last dishonest crooked politician we want to hear from. Go back to sleep. Pathetic.
Aren't these grounds for impeachment?
Your a Loon!!
You are the best!
is it impeachable?  If so, draft the papers and file them the second he's sworn in!
@coton_luver @realDonaldTrump @POTUS how do we stop him? You're  our voice.
Putting self interest above America. Consistent.
@b_antunes @realDonaldTrump @POTUS He had thm prior, so what does it matter? Stupid sht.
Ok. Now what? Dems have been silent on a plan or course of action. How about using this medium to help outline one rather than broad stmts.
BULL!!!
You are sounding and tweeting like Dr Jill. Go away please
Divest now
oh great more noise from another political leech on the taxpayers.
give the man a chance
Quit decrying the rich! Until you demoncrats give up your riches, stop the talking points of the past!
why do the Trump supps always resort to name calling?  Just like their idol.
Because they won't have an adult conversation! Cursing & name calling is a sign of ignorance!
thinks laws don't apply to him. He'll get so arrogant that we'll have ample reason to impeach him. Can't wait.
you lefties are so crazy. I don't know where to start.
What can be done ? This man is the biggest threat to our Country as we know it .
Really? Didn't you hear the press conference? Risk? Doubt it.
@clements_evon @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @cindyrelish@HRC @maddow @cnni @Nunyabizness@KevinDarryl @IMPL0RABLE embarrassed yet?
@Varidienne @realDonaldTrump @POTUS This Is Sheer White Privilege Nonsense!!
How is he getting away with this??
You tell us this BUT what are you going2 do About it? You& our other elected officials can do something?
Not interested, thank you, in anything you have to say.
Elizabeth - you're the only one standing up to Trump - bring up his Child Rape lawsuit (dropped 11/4 death threats)
It has to be written in Law,  otherwise he will not do it.  He is STUBBORN.  Ethics are of no concern
What is the US gov't going 2 do when someone overseas decides to bomb won of his properties?
@thepoliticalcat  @POTUS
Why do cabinet nominees have to provide tax rets & be vetted & there are no requirements 4 presidential candidates? That's crazy.
you're a liar! It is legal for POTUS but he will NOT keep his businesses. Stop spreading lies!
Retire already...
FYI just like the #ClintonFoundation was used as @HillaryClinton was #SoS ? Its ok 2 speak against both parties! #DNCleak #TYT
Emoluments clause will be violated.
never mind potential blackmail material that Russia might have!
WHERE WERE YOU& AL FRANKEN etc WHEN BERNIE NEEDED YOUR HELP? WE'D HAVE Potus Bernie NOT PEDOPHILE HILLARY
& w/o his taxes we don't know if personal debt to foreign interests will drive policy decisions. #ICare
Elizabeth for Christ's sake he's not been sworn in yet. Give him a chance to settle in wtf ¿Clinton FND ?
@PaulBegala @realDonaldTrump @POTUS IS IT ENOUGH TO GET HIM IMPEACHED??? PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
Would he be able to order our military to protect his properties overseas?
But having a shady foundation is ok?
@randyprine @realDonaldTrump @POTUS  I hear you! Apply all laws possible.
at what point can impeachment be discussed due to conflicting interests?
AND SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED! WE NEED TO STAND UP AGAINST HIS ATTEMPTS TO IGNORE THE LAW!
Yeah, his blind trust will still funnel Trump money, probably via his DC hotel.@senwarren @potus @realdonaldtrump @paulrovira1
Be careful 
Trump might buy Massachusetts and put you out of a
job 
Include his family taking positions of power and you have authoritarian rule in the making.  Follow @sarahkendzior Sen Warren.
Thanks for supporting Hillary Clinton... She's being quite the leader for us now. #BernieWouldHaveWon
