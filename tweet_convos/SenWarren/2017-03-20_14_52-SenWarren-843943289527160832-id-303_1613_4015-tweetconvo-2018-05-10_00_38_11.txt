Read my @BostonGlobe op-ed about why I oppose Neil Gorsuch’s nomination for the Supreme Court.
I heard your state is looking for a new senator
we are
Not only will Gorsuch be confirmed. Trump will probably be able to apt 2 more judges during his time in office.
nobody reads the @BostonGlobe anymore, except liberal nutcases like you
Our new Supreme Court Judge #NothingLonneyLeftCanDo
BLOCK HIM. Make em go nuclear
Republicans have not taken nuclear off the table.
They'll do it. Then we use THAT against em, also.
at least she's honest in her financial disclosure.  Unlike the man behind the curtain.....
she didn't disclose her interest free loan from Harvard.
sen warren your a disgrace to our country and to our congress and you should step down from office.
Who gives a rats ass about what you think? Nobody
I can explain your objection in one word.

     CONSTITUTION
read the oath

"I solemnly swear that I will administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich"
the US Constitution gives no preference to anyone by economic or racial standards.
You should do more than oppose.  Now that we know of Russia investigation NO NOMINATIONS SHOULD GO FORWARD.
- because it's Merrick Garland's seat.
but it's not
- It was Obama's seat to fill. The GOP flouted the Constitution and refused to do their duty. #Disgrace
Dems have thwarted nominations too. This is no different.
- Nope. Dems have never refused hearings and a vote, and kept a SC seat vacant for over a year.
then 2006, obama against justice alito
- He simply opposed him, as is every Senator's right.
When exactly did Merrick Garland become "un-nominated"? It doesn't expire.
it does and it did
oppose... better yet, Block his nomination.
you're a hypocrite and if the dems fight him, we will oust all of you. You supported him before. Stab in back now?
Please don't make a deal on Gorsuch! Filibuster him! Show America Dems can fight back even if it's a losing battle!
Neil Gorsuch is a man with impeccable character!! An evil woman like you, would not support him. Seriously,Who cares what u say?
great article, Senator.
@MaxineWaters @NancyPelosi  A STOLEN lifetime Supreme Court seat, by a STOLEN Presidency! HOW IS THIS ALLOWED. Pause til after.
Mrs. Warren you are so full of hate. How do you disenfranchise 63 million Americans voting for Trump? We remember.
We don't need another liberal judge to legislate from the bench either
warren you only are afraid he will uphold the laws that the dems are breaking.
Summary: because he will uphold the law and the constitution.
@mcskinner11 @BostonGlobe he will do a good job,the ones there have been making their own laws,which is not legal //////
Sorry, no longer have a parakeet.  No need for the Globe or you.
I gave the article a try, but you it invluded no sources for it's claims. #abunchofnothing 
Just as soon as I finish Hillary's 'Hard Choices'. IOW, never.
I'm sorry I don't read Cherokee.
Vindictive motives aside, plz tell me you do not really believe a judge should "side" w any1, but apply law fairly.
you are part of the swamp in DC. I can't wait till your out of politics.
because your completely bonkers maybe?
sorry no #Globe is a #Liberal left #fakenews paper, I will wait to get the facts from @Wikileaks
I'm gonna run right out and get that best seller !  NOT!
Short essay:  Because Mr. Soros et al paid me too.
@taylorrixie a good read FYI
I hope you are part of a Filibuster if it comes to that! This decision as you said will affect my grandchildren!
I hate the Donald. But I think you are wrong about Gorsuch. He is a reasonable choice. Don't fight just to fight.
It's a classic case of don't let the perfect become the enemy of the good.  He's reasonable, take what you can get.
Funny how you complain about past situations that you did nothing for the past 8 years
U don't want originalists on the Supreme Court. Because they will give US people back our country! Remember NOV? More of U will B voted out!
"WE THE PEOPLE" R so tired of all the scare tactics and race, cards and every other card U throw at us! That's Y we kicked but in Nov.
we know why U don't support him U won't get your way. The US citizens gave Dems a kick in the teeth in Nov. We don't want U ruining the U.S.
, THANK YOU for representing me.
Thank you @SenWarren & FILIBUSTER to#StopGorsuch! FBI said #RussiaHacked the election So all foreign & domestic policies should be on HOLD!
Whew. Thank you for being strong. Please work on convincing other legislators.
Shut up Pocahontas
I used your article to line the bottom of the bird cage. No one cares what you have to say Pocahontas. #jackass
you dont belong in the Senate yet somehow were stuck with you. But 2018 is coming.
And Pocahontas Warren does not belong in Congress.
100% no thank you.
Hell yes he does
I wouldn't read one single word that you wrote.
your just SCARED to  lose your job... you could care less about anyone else
@WayneAdams1955 @BostonGlobe I oppose just because don the con wants him.They're all critters of the swamp!Not a one is sincere!
because he's Trumps pick?  Or do you expect me to believe you have principles
sum it up. Im a democrat and he was nominated by a republican. Politics expecially democrats are pathetic frauds
.@SenWarren @BostonGlobe Or course, you oppose the nomination of #JudgeGorsuch his conservative views are a liberals worst nightmare.
No. Not interested, Fauxcahontas.
It's even worse, @SenWarren: he is the linchpin in the GOP's budding kleptocracy - a rubber stamp for the puppet in the WH.
@hellmart
thanks for tweeting this article, I've shared it with friends!
@ealight461 @BostonGlobe be prepared to filibuster if necessary
nuclear option, majority wins!
I don't think so #russiagate
@ealight461 @BostonGlobe Thank you, Senator Warren!!! 
BLOCK & FILIBUSTER that monster until he WITHDRAWS!!
@EllenBarkin @BostonGlobe We already know why, you can't fool us with some half hearted excuse. You absolutely hate @POTUS DJT!
you're the best! 
man left co.vehicle2keep from freezing2death,after no pick-up truck comes-gets fired?dont work 4 Corp.Labor is all!
I think he's part Indian, he deserves preferrential treatment. Nobody wants to read YOUR propaganda.
@MAHAMOSA @BostonGlobe you oppose him because he is trump nominee. Two party hypocrisy lives on...and on....and on...
Not holding a hearing should be the response! 
nah I'll pass.
No
Keep wasting everyone's time & money. Your true colors are shining bright.
Neil Gorsuch an outstanding candidate for the court.He has a spotless record and exceeds all qualifications Confirm
You oppose everything.  It's hard to take you seriously
@Boston Globe
 Betsy DeBois does not belong as head of Education. Any educated person knows that.
Bit monry talks and can buy it
Frozen truck driver is the deal-breaker for me!
I would rather watch @CNN but we all know that ain't going to happen, Get Chief 3Nuts to send me a copy @BostonGlobe
...but weren't we told Trump was going to lose and Hillary would win in a massive landslide? 

You oppose him because you're a Democrat hes not liberal enough for you and not willing to violate any federal laws
blah Blah, racist, blah blah misogynistic, blah blah nazi, blah blah Wealthy, blah blah White, blah blah male, blah
LOL why you've been lying and trashing him with smoke signals, not going to waste time reading it.
a stolen seat.  Most not happen.
Sen Warren has certainly lost all her marbles. Boston, I'd be ashamed of her.
@xaws,x5  r7ge?%:
@BillyHallowell
do you agree with anyrhing
I'm with you all the way Senator Warren!  God bless and #FightOn!
God doesn't bless the satanic occult
@meganmckenzie94 @BostonGlobe Well said Elizabeth!  Thank you for fighting for Americans!!
unfortunately he will be confirmed regardless
don't need to read why you oppose him. That's all you do , oppose everything
nothing you can do but whine, the court will swing to the right!
you oppose it because it would set back you and your cronies
blah blah we do not care
every day you sound just like Joseph Goebbles more and more! Total leftist propaganda!
agree!
No one wants to hear what a confirmed liar like you has to say.
Go make a sammich...or some PowWow Chow.....
IT IS MUCH SIMPLER, MERRICK GARLAND NEVER GOT A HEARING OR AN UP OR DOWN VOTE. THIS IS MERRICK GARLAND'S  SEAT !
odd, from here I only count eight Justices
In a court environment, how can you have equal justice for every single one of us?  Ms. Warren, constant ignorance.
.@SenWarren @BostonGlobe @HouseDemocrats @SenateDemocrats DEMS NEED TO BLOCK #GorsuchHearing. Can't go forward with #IllegitimatePOTUS!
Weak arguments. Even weaker coming from someone as disingenuous as you. @BostonGlobe
Liz is the best.  No, ha ha, just kidding.
Because Mr. Soros told you to. @SenWarren @BostonGlobe
Gorsuch does NOT belong in Supreme Court
Please filibuster if you believe that!
Oppose Oppose Oppose!!!
Thank you! One less phone call to make tomorrow 
Senator Warren you are completely right...we need equal justice and not good ole boy justice
i always wonder how people like Warren gets in office then I read comments by her followers ... HATE Is in them
Like Justice-who is BLIND-#gorsuch weighed cases w/o seeing the parties, only the law & Constitution. Your problem?
We get it. You oppose EVERYTHING even remotely associated with @POTUS. So stipulated.
It's getting old, Faux. You and your clowns will steal the "party of no" moniker from GOP if you keep this up.
when's the last time you've had a thorough mental evaluation?  think you're overdue
Why can't u make the stronger case http://www.boomantribune.com/story/2017/3/17/11497/9704 …, Dems won't tolerate our Sup Court seat being stolen?
with Russia hacking probe. No confirmations, no certainty about collusion or coordination. Sooo
no need to read. We all know you oppose everything!  Nothing new to see here
No thanks....I can make up my own mind!   No lies about heritage from HIM!  Can you say the same?
#NoThanksIdRather Give Hillary a bikini wax.
because you are a partisan @BostonGlobe
Did you turn it in via smoke signals?
.@SenWarren @BostonGlobe No surprise.  You're quite ignorant and partisan.
Why would I bother reading your dribble and lies? Truth isn't your forte!
We cannot allow another of Trump's chosen be placed in office while investigation is ongoing. Democrats stolen seat @SenWarren @BostonGlobe
Thank you @SenWarren, we agree Gorsuch does not belong on SCOTUS. @SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris we urge you to filibuster

Are you still around? All you Dems like him a few years ago what made you change your mind now?  @BostonGlobe
Amen sister! Keep up the fight! We, the American people not defined by citizen status, need protection for all!!!
Not defined by American status and need protection for all. How about becoming a citizen first
Our vetting process takes decades. Swap them for redneck no-teeth hillbillies who DON'T pay taxes or work!
I know we should  go high and they go low. They are going really low.
low was the DNC cheating Sanders
How would anyone  know that anyone  cheated  Sanders. What is so funny is that Trump used it to his advantage.
did you miss humas pedo husband, John podestas emails and brazille giving her questions?? Bernie had the millennials.
elections have consequences. Dems could have made this whole thing moot if they would have motivated and won in '16
If you are against him then I pray he is confirmed! Your views are dangerous!
Interesting that Warren knows more than ABA.  #waste
The Stepford Justice. It's like The Breakfast Club, except everyone is the Principle.
He's an Originalist. That should be enough to disqualify him. What outright BS - made of twisted logic. #gorsuch
Also his name is not Merrick Garland, and he was appointed by an apparently illegitimate president.
@SenFeinstein read @SenWarren op-ed. You must do everything to block Gorsuch from being appointed to the Supreme Court! Fight this! #Resist
like your judges in Hawaii and Maryland ? Good judges ah ?? Hahahaha
You are a partisan hack! Showing you care NOTHING for America!
You oppose him because he will follow the law and not your adgenda.
Give me a break! Only one reason you do or say anything: Politics! Some day you will vote on merit! @FoxNews
Looked outside and was amazed the SKY was NOT FALLING! U will fail again as in past!
shouldn't this nomination be placed on hold until full investigation is complete? #Trumprussia
why? What does the fake "Russia connection" have to do with SCOTUS?
