specifically how?
take a deep breath. I know specifics are challenging for you people.
Regulations save lives not tha u folks care about lives u r pro lie not life!
just admit u dont care dont pretend they dont save lives.
should be American families not immigrants
Go back far enough and your family were immigrants.
yes they were immigrants they learned English and american way
Instead of embracing values of original Americans, European settlers committed genocide &
His actions are turning America back into a country again.  You are a hateful, divisive liberal.
Countries and Empires in history have been harsh and even brutal(Roman Empire)  There are extremely harsh consequences ; I am referring...
...to countries today.  Our unique form of gov (which is really experimental) makes it easy for bad guys to take advantage.
@KurtBusiek @POTUS @realDonaldTrump zip it, toots. Your time is over.
Fuck off, dipshit.
Is it really necessary to be so hateful & mean? America doesn't nd that kind of talk We must unite...WE ALL LOVE AMERICA!
some ppl just don't think before open their mouth
Fuck off, dipshit.
you are not better than a dog.
Who are you saying that to?
I was talking to @KurtBusiek. He've got a filthy mouth
So much love from Berlin too you!! Your speech just now had been absolutely amazing!!! <3
Stay in Berlin if u like elizabeth warren. She's a liar and a divider
you and your fascist friends are so scared of her it's hilarious!
why would we be afraid of her? We won't even know her name in 6 months
Oh yes you will.  The truth is getting ready to surface.
. WE ALREADY KNOW THE TRUTH..... TRUMP WON...HILLARY IN HOLE
Of course he did, with the help of Russia.  Shame on you!
I am hoping to harness the energy of rally's and protests here in SLC. #JustUs http://jmcam80.wixsite.com/jmcussenate 
say no to Sanctuary cities
Ben Carson?
WTF???
That's NOT resistance.
That's appeasement!
the American dream has been gone for years families working three jobs to feed their families
Dear @SenWarren Please DO NOT WAIT for any more "actions." @POTUS @realDonaldTrump has told us who he is. #BELIEVEhim @Solutioneer72 IMPEACH
embracing PP abortion policies u r denying the lives of millions from ever having the chance 4 any hope
say no to Sanctuary cities California needs to be part of the US
So then why would you vote to confirm Ben Carson?
Trump's new slogan: Make America Wait Again -- Warren + Clooney 2020

@SpeakerRyan 1st - measure POTUS w/a full psychiatric eval. Stand up for American ppl and ideals b4 he nukes us out of exist.
Please after too long I see a chance out of the snares that I have been caught in. Common sense, use it?
SESSIONS MUST BE CONFIRMED. SESSIONS IS AMERICA'S 1&ONLY HOPE 2SAFEGUARD our US CONSTITUTION/FREEDOM 4MANKIND
IF you consider citizens giving up there jobs to cheap illegal immigrant labor then YES that dream is dead! Thank God
Senator you have to figure out a way to save our country from this tyrant.
.@SenWarren @Sunnysgrl62 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump And this justifies voting for Nikki Halley, how?
So glad you are not the president....
Thanks to YOU!!!!
And yet you support his cabinet choices. #ActionsNotWords, senator Warren
Seriously, Ben Carson?
won't vote you again! You lied to get what you personally want
toasting to you & the #WomensMarch from NYC @melbrennan
A March that REFUSED pro life women.  You're all hypocrites.  Abortion is murder unless medically needed
You don't speak for this female @SenWarren I support @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
but when did she say she speaks for you or all women? 
I don't like the lies she spreads @bethsolomon03 @SenWarren & I am glad she doesn't speak for me! the #AmericanDream is alive and well!
sure the American dream is alive I mean if u consider the fact trump j made it harder four Americans to achieve it within hrs 
BS Lizzy.  Your gig is up.  People will prosper.
@USAaboveparty @POTUS @realDonaldTrump thank you SenWarren for your leadership
@SenSanders Please,People need you 2 bring Dump's gov't 2 screeching halt. BE MITCH MCCONNELL. Vote NO on ALL cabinet/proposals!
@sherrilee7 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump keep confirming the asshats he nominates. Good girl! Have a cookie!
Please vote against all of Trump's nominees Senator Warren! Fight for us! We have no one!
and you rolled over and accepted his nominations with minimal fuss despite it costing you little political capital to resist
Is confirming a man wholly unqualified to be Sec'y of HUD an "action?"  If so, u got some 'splainin' 2 do to your constituents.
You capitulated voted Ben Carson 4 HUD. Dems are jokers. Credibility zero. At least GOP stand on & up 4 their f'd up principles.
why did you vote to confirm Ben Carson? Shame on you.
Wow! And you r a US Senator!? his orders only require that our current laws are enforced.
you voted to confirm Carson
you should be ashamed of yourself. Confirming Carson? We need senators that will stand up to this destructive regime
no he made sure American dream is alive for Americans and not hijacked by those who break our laws
the Dems should be the opposition, not Neville Chamberlain.
Just like the Dems R doing to 9M ppl under #FATCA #FBAR.  Robbed elderly & disabled innocents alike.
: the American dream is for illegal hard working immigrants and citizens
You helped block Bernie who've won. We'd be in a new progressive era not fighting 4 survival. Now your Carson vote?? For shame!!
The American Dream is now dead, it is about survival. Immigration to US won't be a problem @CoryBooker
Why did you vote to confirm Carson?
WTF
You need to represent us, not accommodate the GOP
can we measure you by your votes to confirm @POTUS @realDonaldTrump's nominees? Ben Carson admitted to being unqualified.
same goes for you. You talked a good game against Carson, but you voted to confirm? Your style is chump.
How about you & the other spineless Dems do something about it rather than just jackjawing
Why did you vote for Carson for HUD? He's totally I'll equipped and nuts.
Speaking of actions. Very disappointed about your vote for Carson. #ResistOften #Draincabinetswamp
It's obvious we can't count on establishment Democrats to fight for our freedoms. Warren, you're out!
what the hell are you doing voting to confirm nutcase Carson!?!
Why did you vote to confirm Ben Carson to HUD? We will maeasure you by your actions too, not your words.
STOP. VOTING. YES.
Grow a spine. We are living in a dictatorship and you’re being complicit in it.
you got some s'plaining to-do #idontgetit #bencarson #fr 
@JC_Christian @POTUS @realDonaldTrump so why are you helping him stock his cabinet?
I measure u by the action u took voting yes on Carson for HUD
So did you Dems who vote to approve his unfit nominees.
And how about that vote for Ben Carson? Whatever the reason, maybe bargaining chip, it looks BAD. You're getting trashed on sm.
hoping you could explain your 'action' in voting to confirm the clearly unqualified ben carson to HUD...
You voted to confirm grossly unqualified Ben Carson to run HUD based only on his words. Why should we believe in this advice now?
And you made it harder by voting to confirm Ben Carson. Are you insane? In no way is he qualified to run HUD.
WHY did you vote to confirm #BenCarson? Rolling over is not standing up.
And you voted for Ben Carson.

You are a collaborator.
- thanks for confirming Carson. Appreciate you looking out for your constituents. 
you are disappointing. All talk, talk talk and Twitter, Twitter, Twitter. No backbone. Typical Democrat! So disappointing.
First time I have been disappointed in @SenWarren. Confirmations without a fight.
lack of access to affordable housing makes life harder for families.  Why did you vote to confirm Ben Carson?
why are you voting for him? He's unqualified
Just go away.
but yet you voted for Ben Carson ...#fail
really disappointed with your votes to affirm unqualified and harmful ppl. Where is your fight? You lost me.
And sadly, Senator, I now judge you by your actions:  BEN CARSON???!!!??? Unbelievable and unforgivable
Why are you voting to confirm any of his nominees?  We need to RESIST!!  Don't work with them.  Please!!!
why did you vote to confirm Ben Carson as sec of HUD when he believes LGBT rights are extra not equal?
Ben Carson?  Really, Liz?!?
he's a pathological liar whose only interest is self serving. 
why did you vote for Carson ??
measuring you by yr actions, you don't care for federal housing programs.
Serious question: Why would you vote to confirm ANY Trump appointee? I love you, but too much is at stake here. I don't get it.
why did you believe it was good strategically or for the American people to vote for Ben Carson?
but you hide the fact you took hundreds of thousands to teach one class? #hypocrite #goofy #trumptrain
Why are you and your Dem colleagues voting to confirm his Cabinet of Deplorables?
WTH @SenWarren I thought you were the brave strong one in the face of fascism!
@DNC @TheDemocrats If you cooperate with the racist birther you will find fewer Black people supporting you next time around
So stop voting for his Cabinet picks. #ResistTrump  #TheResistance
Why are you voting to confirm Carson to HUD?
So then why are you voting to approve his appointments?
why the blessed fuck did you vote to confirm Carson
Then do the right thing and vote against every single one of his unqualified nominees.
Why did you vote for Carson? After Saturday? You weren’t brave enough? After 3 million of us showed up? You can’t show up for US?
Strong words! Then you voted to confirm Ben Carson.
yeah your one to talk Pocahantas.
That's a lie Sen Warren~you get the Pinocchio nose today! 
i think he made it harder for politicians to sell out Americans for $$$ from corporations. #ThanksTrump
Donald Trump will make America great again. People like you need to grow up and accept that.
Only his actions.  His words are #alternativefacts.
ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES.  @Reuters @TEGNA @Gannett @MeetThePress @SethAbramovitch
is that anything like your American dream; finer things obtained by lying/cheating. You're pathetic!
@sherrilee7 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump we expect Dems to never work with him. There is no common ground. This is us against them.
please run for president in 2020
No he made it harder for the government to control those dreams.
How exactly did he make it harder???
You do not matter. Your philosophy has destroyed USA. Be quiet
You yell, Barack lied, you are a pot stirrer and are not relevant
Your thoughts on @POTUS ending #TPP  @SenWarren @BernieSanders  ?
the #USA is a World Joke.

Guess denying access is the New Russian Government

 Trump Shuts Down Citizens Access to White House
 Must Use Social Media where it can be DELETED…
it's $500 a year more. Lol. Maybe the former potus didn't simulate the economy like he boasts be did..
shut up Elizabeth, no one cares what you think! If you want change run for POTUS but I doubt you'd win!

.@SenWarren's hardline, counterproductive tactics wear on voters as her popularity takes a big hit #mapoli http://www.wbur.org/politicker/2017/01/23/warren-baker-poll …
wow! Didn't realize how easy it was to buy a home before he did this!.......Jesus Christ, such stupidity!

pls run in 2020 and get this jackass out of there. Latinos with you.
and he's still only warming up.
and he just got started.
Any comment Sen. Warren?
@NBCNews Senator you not call this CEO who is having fun&games on Treasury Funds
I believe in the "American Dream", but if $40/mo. is a deal breaker, they should probably not be buying a house. #dramaqueen
I admire your bravery and boldness,  Ms.  Warren;  the people do what they can,  but keep fighting for those who need you!
Who agrees that it's time for Sen Warren to step aside & for Mass to provide a Senator who represents all
everyone wants you out
then why was the decision/advice made by former President Obama's HUD pick & called a technical decision?
Same goes for u. Who takes the hit on foreclosures if the Mortgage Insurance Fund is underfunded. Answer: middle class families.
you mam are a DISGRACE to the US Senate and a poster child for TERM LIMITS....DRAIN THE SWAMP...DISGRACE
I hope People sees her for who She is and vote her out! Had meeting with Nancy and Soros they his puppets
Folks it's People like this Crazy Woman that our Country is like it is! Where was Her Out cry before now

NO MORE LIES. 

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump #MAGA
Let's get ready to March on Tax Day to support the Presidential Accountability Act HR 6340
And demand Trump release his Taxes and Divest. This bill requires that of the President and V.P.
Just how in the heck did @POTUS @realDonaldTrump do that? 

PLEASE STOP GRANDSTANDING @SenWarren
And, yet again Ms. @CassellBrenda - Thank you dearest! 

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @SenWarren

For the record we didn't put all these republicans in office because we liked what you said.
You fraudulent people can be so comical. #Fake
senator warren is a battle axe faced bitch. She is what's wrong with our country. Vote her GONE.
Here are some images from the Women's March in Houston, TX that I took.
. Life has been hellish and lawless under Democrat rule. You are interested in yourself, not Americans
I can't believe anybody would ever believe one single word out of ur mouth. Straighten up.
Senator Warren, thank you for fighting for us. POTUS-you represent ALL of America, not just the rich.
LIER,LIER Dress on FIRE !
Shame on you DJT. We are watching now more than ever before!
On day one I labeled the Trump administration a FACT manipulator
