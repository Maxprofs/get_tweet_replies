Cutting Medicaid cuts the CHIP program, which hurts sick children.
Repealing ACA,And Cutting Medicaid,Will fill the County Hospitals with sick adults/children
Thank you Senator, for asking the tough questions and not backing down until you get the truth!  
@realDonaldTrump =POS @HHSGov
she was not happy yesterday
Sen Warren was on FIRE yesterday! Leave it to a woman to have the balls! @SenWarren
thats because woman have had 2 fight 4 scraps,while men have had it all handed 2 them
@askmcginty @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov ~~ does the HHS nominee even know where the office is?
Please no cuts to Medicare! That is irresponsible and failing to take care of our elders.
@Solutioneer72 @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov just saying  #NoBanNoWall
You are over your head at these hearings. Shameful. Why does MA elect such a hysterical loon?
Such an obedient little TROLL!  BLOCKED!
 @Researcher_2017 @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov
cut all non citizens off both refugees illegals costing a fortune while not deserving a cent
Trump makes all types of promises and does the opposite or appoints people who will be the bad guys
These cabinet picks are terrifying in and of themselves, but together as a group:
#PeonsIfUAskMe
#yousaidpee... 
@textifyer59 @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov wat does that tell u? Hmmphhh
@HHSGovWhat did you expect?The truth? Now, now, you should have known better.This is Trump we're writing about.
How can we, when people in our state depend on #FoodPantries because not enough as it is now?
He didn't give you the time of day with your trying gotcha questions.
and trump will keep promise.something you would not ynderstand
@MaidMarianT @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov poor little indian girl not happy...HOW!!
protect medicare and social security and ACA thank you senator Warren from America .
unbelievable how his nominee when asked about the cuts, could not answer a simple yes/no question.
@SSWorks @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov 
You did promise s that mr Prez. Don't lie to us.
He should not be allowed to serve.
that wat trump will smile and say he did not make the cuts
Evil begets evil begets evil. GOP keeps on begetting.
@Suma4720 @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Because his pick is amoral.
so what, if trump said it won't happen, it won't happen
Trump made promises but his nominated people  will do the opposite for him so he does not look bad.
look up Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries it looks like you are in for a bumpy ride.
.@Shmarya: "with" & "where", but you knew that. @SenWarren could have made valid arguments undercutting Trump, got tricked by him instead.
Warren rolled in the mud where Trump, right were he likes it. MT @Shmarya RT @SenWarren [I was so dumb Trump tricked me on Medicare]
Did Trump tell Ryan that?  Ryan doesn't seem to know
“@SenWarren: .@realDonaldTrump promised over & over that he wouldn’t cut Medicare & Medicaid, but his @HHSgov nominee won't ?”
I'm Canadian and VERY CONCERNED. Please keep your 'president' accountable for his actions. We can build walls too you know.
Trump promises equal empty promises. Cares little for average Americans struggles.
Once we get rid of the illegals,who zap the system for medical (Axis).$$$ back to medicare/medicad & Americans.
Why don't you tell Americans that Obama took money from Medicare/Medicaid funds for refugees?
senior citizen War! I'll start!!
He'll just "blame" everything on them or President Obama!
My 85 yo Mom lives on tiny SS,has Dementia & needs ALL her Medicare! Sadly, she doesn't mean a thing 2 @realDonaldTrump !
Donald Trump breaking his promise?? Unheard of!!! Keep your word Donald!!!lives depend on it!
but you WONT LISTEN to ideas that could save the failing medicare/Medicaid issue! It's status quo
maybe DT isn't able to control his nominees already?
Where is the accountability?
AW NOT GETTING YOUR WAY POCOHANTAS.?
Trumps a liar!! #TrumpLies
@Bingelish @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov is he letting us keep our insurance and doctors like Obama said
Most of Trump's nominees are set to strip the majority of us of all that benefits us. Repubs also. HELP
Trump never promised that.
You can't believe a liar! He will ruin Democracy and America while lining his pockets!!!!!!!!!!
well, he lied like he always does.
move Congress to Medicare!
the real big cuts should come from the military and Washington (Congress, Govt Depts...).
Elizabeth you are an amazing senator and a fighter for all American people and our best interests! TY
Us old folk will have to go back to work to pay our bills.  America isn't looking so great to me.
And Paul Ryan definitely won't make that promise.So much for draining the swamp - filling it with the 1%
when u sell your cabinet posts to the highest bidder this is what happens.  #cashncarrygov
ridiculous and scary. How did we get to this point. So many people's health in danger.
keep up the fight senator!
Another liberal loser who forgot to take her meds today !
lies...lies...lies ...2 get in door = then back 2 Trump World
Donald is a conman who lied to us all. He is loading the swamp with deplorables like himself.
Keep up the good work Senator... a concerned Medicare recipient.
insubordination?
If Donald Trump & party do not keep his campaign promises, we must say: You're fired! @GeorgeTakei
HILLARY ONLY SAID SHE 
WOULDN'T CUT MEDICARE & MEDICAID BC BERNIE SAID IT.

SHE INTENDED TO CUT THEM TOO
price will do his dirty work, TD will have a Administration that will do his Dirty Work for him. Rip off
He wouldn't even say the numbers. He mumbled his way thru your questioning.
It's late.. Go to bed. Have a drink. No one cares abt your op. You are annoying.....
#4WARN The senior citizens will not be quite!!!

Thank you
Elizabeth! You were spectacular ! Thank you.
Price is a jerk.

Please consider running for president in 2020.

@deejay90192 @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Trump and his appointees are out of step or all are liars. My money is on liars.
That will be his scape goat
thanks for grilling him on this. Gave US pepl clr idea of what destrutn he poses. Good wrk. Thank u!
The people want security not vouchers that are meaningless when prices go up and you have no money!

. @SenWarren @HHSGov @realDonaldTrump #DonTheCon . A fraud.

@GreenPeaches2 @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov what say you?? @JohnCornyn @SenTedCruz
Sen. Warren, Thank you for trying to protect us.
DT talks out of both sides of his mouth
Can't imagine a Republican lying

@halehawk @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov You was good today, keep it up!!!!
he wud have to work extremely hard to steal more money from #medicare than @BarackObama
Sure....trump can say he didn't do....not his fault! Schmuck.
@shaker0309 @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov snake oil salesman
Does this administration agree on anything. The exec doesn't even agree with himself. Aware of issues?
You should really be more respectful when questioning these nominees because they know more than you do. #stoptalking
All you are doing is putting fear in our elderly. Give it up one who speaks with forked tongue.
Sen. Warren is a political terrorist!!
Thank you for showing up ready to ask the questions that matter.
Elizabeth I am so thankful for you! Please keep up the good work!
excellent -hope he pissed you off Pocahontas
they don't needTRUMP-they will run this County and  ramrod- he's a sham! I have swampland for sale!
Donald "The Birther" is not a person you take literally.
hey lady.....wut?
Technically it wont be DJT proposing the cuts but that in no way makes him any less culpable.
This is ridiculous and unacceptable!  Trump ran hard on the promise, hold them to task.
@damonbethea1 @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov WOW #shocking #insertsarcasm
I feel it's the main talking point that got him elected.
As long as they have conflicting views, they will play the blame game. Plausible deniability.
keep at it Girl!
Trump's Communist Lies on Twitter
; Warren, Obama Care is a disaster, something you endorse.
So, do the American People a favor, shut up.
They all lie.They all hate Americans. Why else would they do this. Like stealing an old lady's purse.
Oh please......they're both headed to bankrupting us all. They need reform. Please remove head from rear.
Article stated by repealing ACA, Medicare/ Medicaid will be cut. So far, ACA  added 11 yr.to Medicare
thank you  u do a 
we don't need him.
Do we really believe any of the promises trump made?  He just said what it took to win. He doesn't care!
trump and his gang r going screw everybody but the rich and I hope you stop them
because Trump lied!
Curious, no? Don't subordinates usually follow the boss's lead? Or get shown the exit for failing to?

Please continue your good fight. There is so many of us who need a voice in Washington now.
We don't know what to believe! We are at their mercy.
You're awesome! No one cross examines (I mean...'asks questions') like you.  @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov
Gee, wonder which one might be lying?
don't confirm. Say strong.
go home
WHY DO YOU FEEL THE NEED TO LIE ABOUT EVERYTHING? DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER ABOUT YOURSELF?SHAME ON U
I don't believe anything they say
@HHSGovI'm heartbroken for America and her people. Trump and cabinet care about 3 things: themselves, money, 1%.
u promised u were Indian too
Keep fighting and never give up.
Sen Warren - don't back down. Government is suppose to be for the people, not against.
saw some of that &body language, lier, playing with stock market 2 enrich pocket. Nail him to the wall.
cuz DOB is a con and is lying to us all! Only the fools believe him a face  value.
call an call an call again
D.Trump tells a lot of lies
Trump's promises aren't worth anything; if his lips are flapping, he's lying.
and now @funder is reporting questionable petty cash withdrawal. Plse Investigate!!!

13. A coincidence that Trump- projects financed with dirty foreign money–SoHo, Baja, Tampa, Ft Lauderdale, Toronto–all ended in failure? 
EILAZBETH WARREN FOR PRESIDENT 2020
How you know that Elizabeth because you democrats all lie and steal you think you all thaw same shit and corruption
Bait. Switch. By Proxy.
Well he telling truth then. HE wont do it, the people he appoints WILL.
Whatever we can do Senator, ask. I hate to think you bare the whole weight of holding back the barbarians at the gates.
keep fighting, senator, we're behind you!
thank you for your relentless pursuit of the greater good.  Kaine/Warren 2020?
He is a liar and a cheat. Why be surprised when he continues to lie?
is my hero. Keep grilling those ill-equipped @realDonaldTrump cabinet choices, including  @HHSGov nominee.
People are not metrics.  See you Saturday!  #BosWomensMarch
Another Lie from Corrupt Russian Agenda. ..

the Minority President who got less votes is a lier
he will be the 1st President without a clue or interest in what his gov. secretaries will be up to...
.@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Attack DOG Warren show her Hypocrisy & Ignorance in her unprofessionalism!
http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/01/outrageous-elizabeth-warren-refuses-shake-betsy-devos-hand-video/ …
What's the matter? You got poo poo in the caca pants? Need changing? Mean lady didn't shake hands.
it won't take long before those of us on Medicare make it clear to Donald Trump that that is not a good idea.
Your great work is appreciated.  Please don't let up-this country is in peril with these unqualifieds!
all BS GOP ass kissing to get thought and get a rubber stamp.  Who gets Richer after 20th?
They will ask you over and over to make promises, you will not make any. But be yourself. DT 
thank you for fighting for our rights.
U know as well as anyone that trump & @HouseGOP @SenateGOP don't care abt us. #AllAbtMoney
wait. What is the metric for trading stocks with conflict of interest. Not money, noooooo
Typical politician answer from Trump 'I said I wouldn't, I did not say my HHS appointee would not'.
also his NOMINEES are members of CNP-- WHITE NATIONALISTS!! #NOTRUMPNOKKKNOFASCISTUSA
http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/the-biggest-hypocrite-elizabeth-pocahontas-warren/article/2592680# …!
TRUMP LIES, GOP LIES, HIS NOMINEES LIE.
. Hands off my Medicare & Soc Sec!
His whole cabinet is exactly what he railed against during his campaign. How are his voters not mad?

Elizabeth, thank you so much for taking a stand in today's hearing. I hope he's not confirmed, but I APPLAUD your efforts!
so you were so upset that someone got two more minutes today that you wasted a full 90secs complaining
God forbid. 90 seconds.The horror. Another Petunia broken in breeze. Are you ok or should we call a medic?
more like she wants her 15 minutes far more important issues at hand like #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
No really #AmericaAlreadyGreat
we are all entitled to our opinions and unlike our political leaders I respect yours and wish you will not belittle you
I need to know the name. Please. Who is she or he? In the spirit of cooperation. What's the name? Please. Be cool.
$$ in not the metric...lolololol...please..
Keep letting them have it.   Please.
Do not approve! RESIST! #notmypres
Your work in the hearings has been incredibly inspiring.
Block him. Put a stop to this insanity please
why only woman?
