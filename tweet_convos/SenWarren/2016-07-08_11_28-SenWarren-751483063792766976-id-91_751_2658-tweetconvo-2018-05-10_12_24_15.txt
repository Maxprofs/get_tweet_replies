@CzarofFreedom @SenWarren
no your not
your rhetoric helped cause. Blood is on your hands.
notice how the prog will making morally equivalent the assassination of innocent men and unfortunate deaths during an arrest
Funny! You,HRC&Obama only angry at conservatives, when you liberals are going to be the DEMISE of this planet & country (first)
you dontcare about anyone but your own self promotion .
As long as Repugs sleep with NRA 4 cash cow &campaign funds!Expect only more killings &murders!Guns more important in USA!
@TonyaDiNolfi heart-wrenching honestly.
what of this Elizabeth? https://www.facebook.com/VivaBernie2016/videos/1598635493789274/ …
what about the people in France do you do you think we should have stronger truck controls
@marcylauren I'm sick of this madness too.
thank you
liar! You and your ilk caused this! Its ok, The left is gonna get a great ass whoopin in November! Elections have consequences!
I'm sick at heart because of the incomplete cell fone shown of LA & MN by the irresponsible MSM that caused DALLAS. Outrageous!!!
You are part of the problem that Police are being killed!
then why do u support black lives matter. You are a liar
moral equivalence fallacy
I understand being"sick at heart" for the officers killed by #BlackLivesMatter but you spelled "head"wrong for the criminals shot
wE WILL STOP this as a nation when we change laws on legally protecting COPS...too many racist, corrupt COPS
aren't you a self proclaimed founder of this movement?
sick at heart for BENGAZHI?
liar
I'm sick of Third Way corporate warhound Democrats. #ZeroSec #ZeroRigging
thank you pain is on both sides! Sometimes it takes this 5-officers to feel black pain in white flesh!
u're a soulless crone. U incited the assassination of five brave officers to engage in race-baiting of incidents u had no facts.

then go talk to your friend Obama is horrifying dividing rhetoric is responsible for most of this tragedy
@linseygodfrey liberal bull shit coming out. You don't give a shit about those officers
Can we the people do a sit in in Congress until laws are changed? Will bring snacks.
the man in LA had been arrested 17 time and threatened a lady with a gun. That's why police were called. He resisted arrest. Sad.
you democrats n Obama started this early in his term glorifying criminals death and blaming the officers just to pass gun control
@linseygodfrey don't forget the one shot in Ballwin in Missouri today fighting for his life in surgery right now
get off twitter Warren
And the GOP is not even willing to discuss gun violence which makes it all the more tragic, history repeats itself.
thank you for recognizing both.
actually im surprised this hasnt happened sooner... people get fed up w the hunting of their people!!! Deep societal problem!!!
I am sick at heart this is the history of the U.S. hundreds of years later.Proving we learned nothing.Ignorance is the demise.
Please Don't forget the young unarmed man killed by a cop in Fresno CA last night
And the white unarmed kid in Fresno, shot dead by cops, that nobody heard about. http://www.dailywire.com/news/7274/cops-shoot-white-guy-fresno-nobody-pays-attention-hank-berrien#.V3_1cqr86Ew.twitter …
Vote Trump and vote Republican.
instead of grandstanding, come up w/ real solns to put books in the hands of black inner-city kids instd of gang colors and guns
Americans are sick of fake pols like U & @HillaryClinton trying to profit politically from the blood of the innocent! #Disgusting
Blame @HillaryClinton she supports the NRA and yet you endorsed her
spend a week w/ an officer nd you'll realize how quick a judgement call must be made before your life is taken for doing your job
the difference is, Pocahontas, those cops didn't set out in the morning with the intent to kill a black man.
difference is. The officers did nothing to merit getting shot.
me too I think congress should allocate some our money that they waste on investigations.To help educate our citizens.
You might ADD : TWO murders by cops w/in a mo. n #Tupelo #MS  1 savagely by cop's canine & cop shot 5-6 times! Where's coverage?

All lives are precious. Parents lose their loved ones. Let's do something about the proliferation of senseless killings and hate.
your credibility (after endorsing Clinton) is pretty much nonexistent. Used to be a huge supporter: not any more
and to think. You actually share some of the responsibility. You took part in promoting racial tensions that led to this. #SHAME
and @TheDemocrats push racial strife and division to bolster their sick #getoutthevote agenda. So predictable. So disgusting.
maybe if we didn't have a crappy president they would ACTUALLY do something about this.
what will the Senate do to help stop this from happening?
go away. Stop riding @HillaryClinton coattails and doing her dirty work. let her fight her own battles against T. Lost respect 4u
As we should ALL be.No one has the right to take anyone's life.
with all respect,  we are all sick when you choosed Hillary over Sanders too.  People like Hillary will be a cause of d violence
I am sick at heart for them, for every black or white person, for every Palestinian, Afghani, Yemeni, Syrian killed by US weapons
This is true is there not way of remove officers who have this kind of hate
very sober and compassionate comment. a true stateswoman.
thank you for being you.
#Ghandi
It is getting to be a weekly event!! Time for a change!!
Don't use death of Americans for your political gain
you mean like the shooter
