.@SenWarren @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump women he was planning to interview for cabinet positions, you fraud.
you are no longer relevant Warren! You are about to see a great man show how it's done. Shut mouth, take notes
Warren don't forget to remove the cotton in your ears and blinders from your eyes. You need all your senses to pay attention
said race-stealer Pocahontas
You're such a nasty woman.


As we've seen during election and now since the election you're handy with name calling and smears. U R no longer relevant!
it's only about race or gender if you make it that way. Hey novel idea, how about most qualified.
Love that shitlord in the middle square with the 10 gallon hat. Trumped!

- Romney is the Best in the bunch. He's the only one that brings me an iota of calm. @FemMajority @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump
YESSSSS please do! I hope there are some brown people in there too!

triggered!
<< it's my Guess you have a Black Book like that. @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump
Thats awfully sexist of you Warren, you bobble-headed bigot
It's pretty much a white wash too. Sad!
Oh, lucky us - white, wealthy men making decisions for all the rest of us.
Long as you bring the peace pipe it should be all good
first off shut-up & give the man a chance we put up with Democrats in power now it's our turn
We didn't cheat like DEMOCRATS DID we won fairly the PEOPLE SPOKE Mitt start paying attention
1% @SenWarren sour grapes? You lied about being Indian to get a job live like a queen, criticize others for it
@MittRomney @realDonaldTrump
Ever heard of diversity of ideas?? You aren't in the binders, don't worry. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Read your Bible, If You can't say something Nice,Don't say nothing at all! #TrumpPenceVictory2016
At least he won't be bringing cheese pizzas or hot dogs like the pervy Podestas.  #pizzagate
, You are so short minded. You lost, let this man pick who he thinks is best. You need to shut up!
Your mouth is your worst enemy. Go look inside your house before you mock theirs
is your Indian name "dances with donors"?
As a woman I tell u to shut the hell up! Most qualified ppl need to b picked, not based on sex!
and maybe some people of color, too? This board is entirely too white.
Too white is synonymous with skilled/qualified.
You just supported someone for President who intimidated her husband's RAPE victims. @SenWarren @MittRomney
Gov @MittRomney: when you're meeting with @realDonaldTrump, maybe you could bring your binders full of women with you? 
how was meeting with @georgesoros the other day Did you have to let him lick your soul to get in?
have 2say pretty proud to be  right now!Keep up the good fight Elizabeth
maybe you shouldn't have lied about Romney in such shameless fashion.  @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump
Absurd @SenWarren @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump
and you wonder why you lost lady More comes out of your mouth than my ass!
Go jump in a lake @SenWarren @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump

Typical Trumpy. No taste, decency, ...Very tacky and hateful. @brianknewhouse @SenWarren @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump
ohhhh booooooo hooooooo hooooo. Do you need some play dough &a safe space?
You are disgusting Elizabeth.  Great job helping Killary!
.@SenWarren Keep playing that card, it worked so well for President Hillary Clinton.
another uninformed.
and this is why @HillaryClinton lost. Race/gender does not come before skill/knowledge/trust.
shut up you fake Indian!!#wannabe
Still lobbing insults? Because resumes of qualified, intelligent women is a BAD thing to you? @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump
Here you go Fauxcahontas
https://www.ancestry.com/dna/ 
STFU Pocahontas... No one wants to hear or see you!
Throw out binder hire all men. Happy now Ditzy Lizzy?
When does it stop?  The Donald is in the WH; let's try to mitigate the dmg w/ someone rationale.
Why are you hating so much on him? You are not even trying to give him a chance. It's his cabinet, let him pick who he wants.
if he does, perhaps you can cater the meeting with recipes from 'Pow Wow Chow'

Just a suggestion
Obama's...
Post Election PTSD..Post Trump Selection Disorder.   
Wow, that is pretty childish.  I can't believe you tweeted that. #GrowUp
we need a cabinet which THINKS like America, not necessarily LOOKS like America. Liberalism is such a failure
Love you @SenWarren! Keep up the good fight!
Fun to see Kelly, Jan and Sarah in the picture - all unemployed so we know they are available
Good start.  But can you spot the other glaring problem?
they're all terrible awful people?
Even better, bring your buttplug.
but which qualified, smart and dignified woman would like to work with @realDonaldTrump?
#sassy #ilikeit
Nice try, Pocahontas.
triggered
You're off the list, Liz. Authenticity is a requirement.
@DarHuddleston @SenWarren  @realDonaldTrump They had hundreds of VP selections on their so called list and missed Pence
ride on Elizabeth, God is with you always never forget that for an instance
Obama's female problems: Sebelius, Lerner, Rice, Jackson, Lynch, Clinton.

we can guarantee, your name won't be on it.
@realDonaldTrum
#triggered because no #fake #native #American
So much for working with DJT ?
Need to get that Trump IRS in Jan to take a look at those Warren campaign finances. 
When the Dems weaponized the IRS they had to know it would circle back on them. 
many qualified women who could serve far better than current rights stomping fellas selected
Elizabeth, get a life
Thank You Reid! now all of these picks are in the bag due to the "Nuke" Option
unbelievable this is exactly what @realDonaldTrump and his supporters wanted
Wow, you ridicule someone who wanted to higher qualified women, Tired of you. It's medication time
hey #FAKEINDIAN maybe you should bring all your falsified job applications?? #lethimlead #fakeindian
@scottferson @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump and a co in MA employing thousands he helped start had brilliant women leading it
off subject, but are we really going to require registration for Muslims? So wrong & scary.
What an idiot! I don't like name calling but sometimes there are no other words.
#drainingtheswamp #TermLimits #senwarren soon please
I noticed there's no indian women on the list - I guess that leaves you out elizabeth.
The "binders full of women" thing is about the least substantive political criticism of all time and you know it.
This stupid, unfair line of discourse is beneath you. 
Wait, no. Nothing is. @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump
Gov @MittRomney: when you're meeting with @realDonaldTrump, maybe you could bring your binders full of women with you? 
@maggie15228 @SenWarren @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump WARREN- you are a hack job. I could never follow you ANYWHERE!!RaceBaiter
Not helpful & churlish. Your thinly veiled Prez ambition is a disgrace for US. Mitt is OUR Statesman
calm down goofy. You supported a criminal and lied about your ethnicity to get ahead. Tee hee  @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump
don't denigrate the only nom who isn't obviously evil & insane. Romney sucks next 2 a Dem, but a goddamn saint compared to Trump
<--Are you really still tweeting things like this in 2016? Binders meme is #weaksauce compared to serious issues.
Liz, maybe you can publicly apologize to Native Americans for cultural appropriation. #fauxcahontas
for Pocahontas, the thought of being chosen based on MERIT is unfathomable
Keep it up, you're working on guaranteeing Trumps 2nd term! @SenWarren @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump AGAIN...
your a joke lol

Maybe Sen Warren can return all the money she earned for faking her Indian heritage. #fauxcahintos
Your childish pettiness,creating a non story of "Binders" is one of the reasons we have a Donald Trump presidency.
maybe he could bring binders of qualified people regardless of race or gender. This is why you lost.
Trump supporters continue to dispute the indisputable. Unreal.
Senator, gentlemen, GO THE DISTANCE
Mitt shouldn't even be considered for any office He's a hack and a traitor, lost election on purpose
boo hoo Lizzy
Bravo!!!!
@Visitkarte @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump this country is in deep s***.
race and gender have nothing to do with qualifications.Such ignorance on the left it's reprehensible
@mdcolli @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump Look it's old CrazyClown Warren queen on the Dipshit tribe!
hopefully his women are anti-violence unlike you and your fellow females in congress
Sorry but having a vagina is not automatic QUALIFICATION! Put down the gender card! you are
@_EmilyNorton @MittRomney being snarky with a decent, patriotic man who held out as #NeverTrump is not productive
Do I really need to say how fucking juvenile this is,and if u ever run for national ofc,this is ad.
funny how just a few months ago the left loved Romney for not supporting Trump. Liberals are lost.
can you say 1 positive thing about trump.
@FemMajority @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump
whaaaa
Mrs. Warren my grandmother was a full bloodied Cherokee. You madam are a fraud!
Maybe if your party hadn't vilified Mr. Romney we'd be looking at a totally different USA now
lol look out #despicables Liz is on a roll.
Kathy Shelton treated like crap by Hillary, shut up Liz Warren! Fake feminists both.
...mission...(ary)
and I thought they go low we go high
Jeff Sessions appointed for Attorney General? He has a human-rights score of ZERO! He is racist!
#Fauxcahontas you're such a buttercup. You offer nothing but failure & lunacy.
@jen3vieve @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump the gender gap is bad but white nationalist, racist, alt-right peeps more horrible
Warren has run out of trite material so she's going back to recycle 2012 attacks on Romney ?
@MaryintheMntns @SenWarren @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump She acts like a dude
Warren is always angry, upset & name-calling;same things she criticized @realDonaldTrump 4
We love you elizabeth!!!
get a grip. You call yourself a strong woman??? No one can stop you from living your life, right? @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump
Why don't you give full disclosure of what transpired in your meeting with #GeorgeSoros @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump
hillary and bill probably have some you could barrow
You know; even democrat friends of mine in MA are embarrassed by your lack of ethical behavior.

And maybe you can bring your teepee along with you the next time you see your shrink to deal with your unhealthy Trump fixation.
we're looking for the best people for the job,conservatives don't see color or sex only prog-libs do
Remember when our politicians didnt mock everyone from the other party and didnt fawn over quotas ?
Yea Yea. So tired of the talking point playbook. Your pathetic ideology lost. Deal with it.
your finger wagging cost HRC the election . Mitt is a good man and we would be lucky to have him.
Go smoke a peace pipe with your people Pocahontas ...lol
This is so immature from a woman of your age. Best u got?
And I want to see some people of COLOR
#MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain he is an abomination along with his ignorant minions
Maybe pick a Native American woman like @SenWarren #caring
Sen Warren, you are very unkind at a time when Pres Obama and Sec Clinton have asked for better.
Hey big mouth Warren, go crawl under a rock! Your kind lost. America just rejected you libtards!!!
it will be okay
Sen. Warren sometimes respect 4 others is a more effective tool than sarcasm in persuasive argument.
We can't consider ourselves a democracy until over 50% of the population is minorities. Same here.
Liz. I know you believe that computers have always been around, but back in the day we had binders.
Triggered because Romney didn't have a binder of blonde, white "Native American" women.
.@SenWarren Glass ceiling SHATTERED with @KellyannePolls - but you knew that

@MittRomney @realDonaldTrump
Elizabeth Warren defrauded Asbestos victims while working for Travelers Insurance. She's a peach!
or maybe your should tell all of America how many job applications you put you were American Indian on??  #NOTMYSENATOR
Only after your American Indian birth certificate - start dressing accordingly!
- Oh stop it you hypocrite!  I'm sure he's bringing his basket of deplorables  #StopWhining
.@SenWarren @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump 
Sick burn, Warren.
Maybe you can bring your "I was once a Squaw" photo album with u at next job interview.
lol, that was funny:)
.@SenWarren Of course you would mock and dismiss anyone making an actual effort to hire women #hypocrite
lol
Trump just wants Mitt around to bully and humiliate him?
Appointments will be on Merit, not what "group" you belong to
... Liz, you are savage!  @TheYoungTurks

the are all sick twist minds that should be no where ever never the white house ever.
Warren got wealthy from capitalism NOT redistributing wealth. Romney had  women's resumes for hiring
I want to know more about the Florida numbers mismatch and kremlinites links with the voting machine company...
Meow, Meow
Why Elizabeth? Trump selects on merit, unlike the Democrats!
People who live in #glasshouses. http://www.thepoliticalguide.com/Profiles/Senate/Massachusetts/Elizabeth_Warren/Scandals/ … #hypocrite #democratssosenstitive #DemocratLiesMatter
you had a chance to run and make a difference but you didn't. all you have left are a few soundbites without teeth. It's on you!
oh boo hoo.
- Keep playing the female card and you will keep losing!
ooooh! A bit snarky?
