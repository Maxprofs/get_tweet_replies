You didn't see Donald Trump's statement about Dallas, did you?
Trump has never said anything bad about black people during his campaign. Not sure where you're pulling this from
He wasn't saying to attack him because he was black. He was assaulting Trump supporters. Not racist.
it can't come with Hillary. Maybe you would change thing but she didn't have you be vp when she should of..
At least you admit to having no answers... Why didn't you say so BEFORE you were elected?
Never prouder of having been your student. True empathy is the 1st step. It awakens us to the reality of disparate experiences. @senwarren
" @Only4RM I Gotta Say I'm Kinda Jealous That You Know - @SenWarren I Adore Her!! "
Me too!
what happens to a tk when vp out shines the top of ticket?
solves  Sec.Clinton's honesty problem as well as the pro Bernie folks.HISTORY
Maybe your new buddy Hillary will put forward a new Super predator crime bill?
Confusing former Pres. Clinton with Future Pres. Clinton. It's like saying Trump will pose nude like his wife did.
Did I say she signed that bill? I mightve missed that. Can you point to where I said that so I can retract it.
You implied it. Linking @HillaryClinton to the bill as if she had signed it.
Nope. Words have meanings. I said she'd put forward a new S. Predator crime bill. Didn't imply she did the last
Black Lives Murder, don't they?
this is why people are voting for @realDonaldTrump.
Obama was way more progressive than Hillary was potus for 7 y, here we are- so what´s gonna change with her? Seriously explain
so why did u endorse HRC? True change will only come fron third party.
It'll come when President Trump is elected.
Everyone would feel less pain if you went away.
@c_nephobe Thank You Senator Elizabeth Warren for Really actually Caring about The American People and Our USA!
You are One of The Best Persons that ever Happened to THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I HAVE SEEN YOU FIGHT FOR US ALL!
how about the pain the innocent babies feel slaughtered in the womb that you so vehemently deny any human rights for. Disgust!
you are severely mentally ill and need to be removed from the Senate.
Are you considering resigning? That's a good start.
Change is coming this Nov & your Party is dead!
i thought thats what your boy Obama and left wing nut jobs have been preaching for 8 years. Seems like "change" for the worse
You can!  Bring clinton to justice and have her tried for all of her crime clans screwing of humanity. Start with election fraud
Trump is the answer. Hillary can only win with more lies on DNC.
How about "stopping the pain" of the millions of babies who have felt the pain of abortion?
.@SenWarren So you support Trump?
That's what Obama said, too. He only made it worse. What did YOU do?
More hate, racism & bigotry which Trump represents is the OPPOSITE of what we need.He symbolizes divisiveness & hate #WeMustUnite
and that´s why you endorsed Hillary?!! Come on some honesty please
I might be able to help you with that Liz.....here's the answer #Trump2016
honey, this is the change we've been waiting for. 2008 was so powerful, I can still feel the tingles on my leg.
that's inspiring, not!! #trumpence16
@SenWarren
and one of the changes is not having Clinton as President. Not my commander in chief. Mass resignations from military r coming
stop buying into the black lives movement. It stokes the fire!
#StillSanders #VoteGreen
We tried that. You endorsed the corrupt status quo. You are faker than Clinton. You blew it, liar.

@SenWarren #DemsInPhilly #BernieOrBust
Yes! Resign from office! The best for US!
I have to say I agree with you on this but very little else recently. #SeeYouInPhilly
Your party created the pain. Wreaked the havoc. You're responsible.
Yeah its called get rid of $hitlery!!!!!!!!!! She should be in Prison! Chump wudnt even get close in the polls! U sold out!
you just summed up the utter failure of Barack Hussein Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton perfectly
@SenWarren
I agree things need to change but your rhetoric AND Trump's rhetoric are what's dividing us. Let's up our game towards civility
Yes, and the change is... TRUMP 2016!!!!!
then instead of chastising people start making some changes people are dying and all you guys are doing is waiting for November
failing to mention who has been in charge for the last 8 years.
and it will...... with real honest strong leadership!
To effect change we need to stay away from democrats. The pain you are feeling is Obama and Hillary. TRUMP 2016.Hillary to prison
RESIGN! That will help stop the very real pain many of us feel about the laws you have passed with no support from THE PEOPLE!
I couldn't agree more that the sooner @POTUS is gone the better things will be for everyone!
Agreed.
Its called....End Liberalism
We love you kiddo
Leave the Senate & we'll be happy to get rid of your potty mouth

It was the best feeling that I could hear from someone...
I have the answer, declare Clinton a criminal and boldly declare your support for Sanders. You have lost thousands of fans.
@TYTNetwork #JILLNOTHILL
You certainly are NOT helping the problem by sucking up to her  @cs501
and Bernie IS the change.  NOT Clinton.
was a hero to millions of People, has now been reduced to a caricature by endorsing @HillaryClinton. https://youtu.be/WSEehau09l4 
You should have been at the #CommonBound conference last weekend, put on by @NewEconomics! Very exciting!
seriously! Every struggling kid I know is being hounded by the Ma Dept if revenue. Go after the real culprits. What is up?

Here's Your Answer:
PLEASE become our next VEEP!
https://twitter.com/RedAllOverFilm/status/752250859904307200 …
you and your party have created this divided nation, according to DNC master plan. A real Indian princess would sacrifice herself
>@SenWarren Agreed; we can start by completely rethinking structure and approach to federal and state policing. Guidelines will not work
. Really that's the best answer you can come up with? Real issues make U look like a key stone cop. Your a lime lighting goofball.
Fauxcahontas is on her "Trail of Tears".
Listen to actor Scott Baio! Obama has never used the word Islamic terrorism.He in his small mind, still thinks
Islam is peace
Authors of books paint HRC as a dictator who once threw a bible at a Secret Ser Agent and berated a lot of peoplebehind thescene
Gun control is not the answer! Who has accessto guns is themain question! we have a right to defend ourselves against those??
stop hiding behind tragedies. We know you're ashamed. Talk about why #Shillary
but you can tell your buddy Clinton to go against TPP
Then stop supporting the Clintons
for change to come, we must stick to our principles and fight for them, no matter what seems politically wise at the moment
You've joined the ranks of the false progressives. Go back to your multi millions and spare us. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmB0YSotXJQ&feature=youtu.be … #ZeroSec
You corporate warhungry 'Third Way' false progressives need to stop. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5r_jqBk74 …
https://www.minds.com/blog/view/597601536503193603 … #ZeroSec #ZeroSellouts
why don't you tell the truth
you can start by not promoting the falsehoods that exist regarding police shootings, and inciting violence against police
You have no answers, as you have not figured out what lie to tell next. Are you now black? #All_Lives_Matter
You must be so conflicted right now. Don't abandon your principles. Abandon the crooked establishment. You joined them!
people simply need to make decisions on issues before them, the issues are not that complicated.
Start an honest conversation using facts, science and truth to lead the way. Facts matter.The truth matters more.Hemp 4 industry
so stop tail light stops they're just for revenue anyways. And to fill the prisons with pot smokers
End the war on hemp and create jobs-“Hemp for Industry” video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kybQTtnJjQA …  working together to make things better
@SenWarren
IMHO, we are experiencing the fallout from the war on drugs.Cannabis hemp should be utilized to create jobs and bring us together
RETIRE. You have ovetstayed your usefulness & are no longer needed in the Senate
Shoulder to shoulder with you, Elizabeth! #StrongerTogether @pkdof
all your goals are "losers" now. You had morals. You'll never win. Not now. Damn. Bernie couldn't afford you huh? No integrity.
sorry that it won't come with your warmongering buddy. People loved you. Might as well have chosen Trump.
End military surplus transfers to police departments.
Police departments should not be profit centers for local government.
More rigorous psych evals for police cadets, weed out the bullies.
There are real steps that can be taken. Take them! End civil asset forfeiture, remove local prosecutors from police homicides.
yes finally words of wisdom! Change in the form of @realDonaldTrump! Amen!
you don't want change you support crooked and corrupted Hillary two people are sick of corruption and you are part of it resign
Goofy @SenWarren doesn't know anything about politics and has done nothing for the people of Massachusetts
It starts with unity instead of division.  It starts with accountability and integrity.  In short, a ways off.
how's about ending th he war on drugs and setting free those people in jail for minor offenses?
support @BernieSanders instead of @HillaryClinton for starters. You sold out and now you think Hillary has a plan?
We need changes2 police department U DO have answers-Start fighting for policy changes U r not a victim, u r in govt u have POWER
maybe you should go into a sweatlodge, smoke some peyote and you'll have a vision from the great father telling us what to do.
Change kemosabe, change...
BTW -  love you and what you do, thank you
Ppl like Trump make it WORSE, words matter, he has no idea & no business running for office
Pocohontos!!!!
"The time is out of joint"
@deb3ms This is a situation where everyone feels betrayed. And everyone is right to feel so.

Only thing that comes close to an answer is "The Power of Prayer"!!!!

DemExit July 29th. See ya later fucking sellout.
the pain in the history books living in real life-triple k cops are for real! Masters of slaves in uniforms
.@SenWarren @CarolGo18658081  You are and can be a great help, Sen Warren.
I went from holding your progressive ideas vs wallstreet to seeing your demise backing a criminal...
you're a joke backing Clinton. Documented evidence she helped create ISIS by destabilizing a nation.
your buddy Hussein Obama was slinging change 8yrs ago. No thanks fake-ahontas
POTUS n WH, bigots n Congress voiced neg effects@him that  embedded subconsciously spewing hatred on blks&death as a denial!
@NoGOPNo Senator Warren....please be a Vp.?
u're a soulless crone. U incited the assassination of five brave officers to engage in race-baiting of incidents u had no facts.
Are you trying to be ironic again as you are pushing #Hillary?
If u want to "stop the real pain people are feeling" stop supporting Hillary, she's a criminal & our country w/her'll be worse
.And that change will only come if you are elected President of our nation. You are our Lincoln. There is no one else/we need you
I'm part Cherokee Indian work at Pepsi in Ohio Ur not native American
And Real Soon Because It's Getting Really UGLY Here In AMERICA PEOPLE ARE ACTING LIKE A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY
that's what she said
@NoGOPNo Gun control has to be one.  Eliminating -BANNING-high capacity magazines & semi auto weapons good start.
.@SenWarren Change will only come if we act. Idle wishes are passive beliefs.
love you! Keep fighting!
Hope and change huh? Sounds like the empty promise made 8 years ago.
If Hillary Clinton------was a black person she would be under the prison

VIDEOS http://s1.zetaboards.com/Express_Yourself/topic/6124510/1/#new …
if only you were a leader who could make these proposed changes
You and your colleagues have the power to do something meaningful. We don't need sad feelings. We need action.
Special federal investigators and prosecutors, because nothing says accountability like imprisoning abusive and killer cops.
Fund litigation for victims. Fund training programs for police departments. Make a federal standard for police officer quals.
Get rid of  the awful laws that make it "legal" to steal money and property from citizens. Go all out to restore voting rights.
Create a federal office to help victims of police brutality. We don't need sad feels or thoughts and prayers. We need action.
Here are some BLM policy ideas: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34023751 …
Out of the 56 unwarranted shootings by police in 2015, 2 were black. This its a plan to divide USA & its working.
.@SenWarren Solution: You can wake up Hillary Clinton to see the pain of hard times & offer REAL reform. http://www.agreater.us/billpage.php?id=409 …
why would u think u might have answer for this since u have been in office u have had no ans.
agreed... unfortunately you endorsed the candidate that wont bring us change.
yeah, change BACK to a constitutional republic.
speak up
.@SenWarren Praying doesn't help. Gun control does  #NoBillNoBreak #StopGunViolence #Enough #NRA
I'm praying for us to stand in unity for peace. Praying for open hearted efforts between citizens and law enforcement.
Who has the courage to call out the criminal enterprise known as the #ClintonFoundation ?
Who will arrest the criminals running our government?
stop encouraging domestic terrorists like black lives matter and it will improve
how about your 2nd ammendment? Time to review it?
I'm sick of politicians who claim to fight for us & then endorse a plutocrat for POTUS, who lies and endangers National Security
@SusanNealsusan2
@OfficialShaneG #Warren & race baiting #Democrats just need 2 shut their mouths! Officer's blood is on their hands!
The blood is only on the hands of shooter. The issue of police murdering is just as important as them being murdered.
There is no problem of "police murdering" anyone! The #Left does have blood on its hands 4 stirring race violence
Damn right this was disgusting murder. I apologize for ever considering to vote for you, Terry
apology accepted.
