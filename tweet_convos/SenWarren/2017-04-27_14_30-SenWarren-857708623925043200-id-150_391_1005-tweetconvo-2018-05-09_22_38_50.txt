#TermLimits for all.
you are kidding right.  You didn't play his actual answers & you didn't play your actual questions it's all fabricated BS.
First of all @SenWarren, what book says you cannot accept a fee for speech, and that all Democrats must take a vow of poverty? #Obamaspeech
Would you be defending Obama if he gets $400K from speaking to the NRA or an anti-choice group? Whys there a different standard for Wall St?
Yep if he was speaking to them on why gun reform is a must? He is speaking to them about Obamacare, not tutoring them on robbing people!
Again, Wall St. isn't paying Obama $400K to bash them for 45 min. That never happens. It isn't how our system workds
You don’t know that. He hasn’t exactly been shy about sharing his views on controversial topics in the past.
Yes, but not in front of unfriendly crowds.
No, just the entire damned country including red states that thought he was evil incarnate.
Average people don't pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to hear him speak
Not sure about Chuck but am sure Warren would not win!! Obama is doing nothing wrong by speaking to Wall Street!
You are not at all qualified to judge any person's credentials regarding any office!
@SenWarren was NEVER ELECTED

SHE BOUGHT KERRY'S SENATE SEAT
When he became Sec State.

Even MA would NOT elect this shrew!
Stop it. We need to have an open mind bc we can say that is true with all politicians. (Trump cabinet)Im saying.
GOP's efforts at "union busting" has been painfully effective. With no advocate in the Bureau of Labor, workers must sue to protect rights.
Given Trump's prior appointees, only consideration n needed is loyalty to Trump and his profits.
Yep.   That's the way they like it.   Cash for them is good.  But cash for the rest is not allowed
Did you stand up for @SenSanders when you helped steal the nomination from him?
how many?
this is just more swamp like activity - fabricating something you think we are too stupid to see it 4 what it is
How Lizzie? More mindless shrieking.
Witch
Stop criticizing Obama, Fox is using your words against dems
You disparage President Obama you will lose BLACK PEOPLE we will not be forgiving you ask Bernie enough s*** was done to Present Obama STOP
Bernie Sanders lost a lot of black people when he disparaged President Obama and wanted him primary and he never got them back he lost me
F you Elizabeth Warren. Keep Obama's name out of your mouth, you grandstanding screeching hack. Get off the cross, we could use the wood.
President Obama cannot run for president again so your problem is starting to look like maybe because he's a black man DON'T PAID HIM
Why is it that WHITE PEOPLE always have a problem when it comes to BLACK PEOPLE getting paid what they deserve for the work that they do
If you try to disparage President Obama you will lose if anybody deserves to be paid for speeches he does, he's the best speech giver EVER
I'm a black woman and if you continue with not wanting President Obama to get paid you're going to lose a lot of black people STOP IT
Stop it with not wanting President Obama to get paid, I'm starting to feel you might be a little racist not wanting to black man to get paid
Love her you go girl
If you and Bern are gonna lead Dems than you have to be more careful. Using the wrong words will perpetuate the image of "Dems divided"
Careful calling Obama's payment "troubling". Alot of ppl think the Dems are splintered and "in trouble". They don't need anymore infighting
THANK YOU ! MRS WARREN!
IT WILL BE A PLUS IN EVERYWAY!
AMERICA WILL ONCE AGAIN DOMINATE IN INDUSTRIES!
BUSINESSES WILL FLOURISH  AND OWNERS WILL HAVE BETTER PRODUCTIVE WORKERS!
It WILL PUT MORE MONEY INTO CIRCULATION! PEOPLE WILL SPEND MORE! AND ALSO SAVE MORE#!
IT WILL NAROW THE GAP BETWEEN THE RICH AND THE POOR!
IT WILL HELP STUDENTS WITH THEIR LOANS; BECAUSE MANY WORK PART TIME! AND FOR THE MINIMUM WAGE!
IT WILL INCREASE THE LIFESPAN OF SOCIAL SECURITY!
How dare you open your mouth about anything Pres Obama is doing after office.  You DEMS need to be getting Trump out of office
Very disgusting of you to slam Obama.
Congratulations! Fox News is playing your comments about Obama's speech. Meanwhile, the most corrupt administration in history occupies WH.
Are u still an Indian?
And it is not just The Ex-Presidents it is ALL OF THESE CORRUPT SENATORS THAT MAKE ENOUGH NOISE POINTING FINGERS AT OTHER SENATORS LIKE  's
THEY ALL CASH IN BIG TIME RIGHT "POCAHONTAS" and Now Like Hillary Thought You Believe ITS YOUR TIME, ITS YOUR TURN. RIGHT? I Do Not Think So
ESPECIALLY FOR 30-40 MINUTES FOR IN EXCESS OF $500,000 BECAUSE THEY ARE PAYING PRIVATE JET, HOTEL, SECURITY. SO ITS ACTUALLY $1,000,000+
Except for a Manuscript, HOW DOES IT BENEFIT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO HAVE THIER EX-PRESIDENT SPEAKING TO A GROUP IN DUBAI? IT DOES NOT SO NO
Has Said Like The No Lobbying He Will Make It That Presidents Will No Longer Be Able To Cash In With These Outrageous Speaking Feed Etc..
Like All Ex Presidents Since Reagan Showed You Can Cash In Presidents have Fine tuned it Except GW Bush a Man of Class and President Trump
Of Cash Would Open For Him $260+ Million into "Obama Foundation" in The First 2-4 Years YOU KNEW, NOW DID YOU NOT?  So as always u r CORRUPT
What a Deceitful Liar You are Elizabeth "Pocahontis" Warren, You were Obamas right hand bit@h now U will turn EVERYONE Knows The Floodgates

if you are worried about money in politics why are you still a democrat?
Gf, shut up about Obama, we have to stick together more than ever now! Comments like that are damning and will be shown on faux!
What does your political philosophy get you? Venezuela you traitor to the American people.
And you failed basic math. Yet there you sit.
Please do what you can to keep him from getting confirmed.
Since when does Pocahontas know anything about what a labor secretary should and shouldn't know or do!
150M workers? Are they legal US Cutizens? Here legally? Have a birth certificate from the US, or a green card or a decree from the US!
Vote no
Pocahontas Warren is bad for workers. She has no idea what real people in the real world endure while she mucks around talking about BS.
Senator Elizabeth Warren is fighting for what is right,  not just allowing people in to be a Trumpet.  A person who doesn't do what is rite
Pocahontas Warren is fighting to enrich her wallet. She is a shrill opportunist sucking up Other People's Money like a vacuum cleaner.
That corrupt money grubber is now our POTUS and family.
Who are you talking about? Trump took a pay cut and in this, he's unique. DinakdxTrumo has always been generous.
Well, you failed as an Indigenous person and you're ok so I think Acosta will be too.
Another one for the "Well Duh Report". Hard to keep up with it all!
We need you out! Term limits!
Don't know why you are so troubled  by a black man getting paid for his services girl bye 
Leave the Obamas alone too, you sound like Bernie!
Focus on the Trumps corruption and quit dividing the party like Bernie did to Hillary!
please focus on #Impeach45  fish stinks from the head down. Time for a fish fry #Trumprussia
You mean stand up for your UNION buddies don't U the ones that donate $$$ to your campaign? GO GEOFF!
Bad choice.
Hey @SenWarren he'll stand up for 150 million works plus the millions that will finally JOIN the workforce thanks to @realDonaldTrump
What positive measures are you taking to help solve what you perceive as problems
Sounds like you just prefer insult @POTUS & his team
Sad!
You have no credibility, no accomplishments and hopefully will not be reelected!!!
Come on Warren didnt you get a blockbuster deal 0%interest on your million dollar Mansion hypocrite democrats
Note did you send Trump a letter about his living conditions, and the money the Winter White House in FL no not one d--- word
Will you stand for the miners of MN
Omplaunt. Stop flooding Twitter with tweets. It's so Trump-like. ECONOMY!
Did you really expect him to   Really ?
Too late! We are already following President Trump! You see you had 8 years to help the American workers but u didn't. Too little too late!
M'am.. With all do respect... Obama is not president anymore.. Therefore he should make paid speeches regardless of the price....Just saying
Oh shut up Elizabeth. Do your job or we will vote you out of office.
You act like a petulant child. I don't know how anyone take you seriously.
Go Elizabeth Go
Good, keep focusing on these things and not on Obama getting paid to do a job. That was not for you to judge. The current pres is.
No lizzy, it's a matter of supporting both labor and manufacturing with a proper balance! Guess your view is why you are so screwed up!
We do need people in these positions to stand up for the many not the few 1% profit over safety. Thank you senator.
Liar!
Dizzy Lizzy ,u have failed everything u have ever attempted.At least ur in the right party being the loser you are !
I feel the same way as Senator Warren about silica, overtime and crooked financial advisors. Those were fair questions and Acosta blew it.
You fail every basic test for being an American... quit
if Trump elected Obama for something you would still oppose him, u traitor
You have become a #partisan #shrew who makes decisions based on your hatred of any and all who do not agree with you.
Whine, whine whine. That's all you do...
Term limits please.
I would think the test of a US senator would b 2 stand up for 321mil US citizens. How's that working out for u & those u've deemed unworthy?
What did he say about raising minimum wage? I'll do what executive orders tell me to do? Or U21 youth don't need to put food on the table!
Says the lady who screams about equal pay for women, while not paying her female employees equally. Stand up for your peeps, then speak.
Pres. Trump rec. solid support from working taxpayers to win the election. His appointments to date reinforce that trust. We trust  POTUS.
and now he is going to stab you in t the back unless you make add much as he does and wait till you needed medical coverage
So your paying terrorist families in Palestine ? But we can't help our own? Where are your priorities? Resign
Washington???
U never did! Anything he does is better than that. Y R U objecting to Gov getting smaller? We don't want U controlling our business & lives.
She persisted!
You are so ridiculous, who would think you were educated. If you want to be president,
Sen Warren show us your taxes.
It's probably unrealistic to expect any one agency to defend all workers simultaneously, there will always be conflicting interests.
No they wont
