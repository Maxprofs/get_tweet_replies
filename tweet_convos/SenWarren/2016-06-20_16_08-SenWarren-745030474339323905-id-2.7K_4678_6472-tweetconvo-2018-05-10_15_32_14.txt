Entirely clueless statement. It's not about guns, do your job. Fund law enforcement, full the cracks.
This adm picks & chooses what laws to enforce, right now foreigners are winning.
The Obama Administration, via Hillary, decided to do that years ago. You could ask Chris Stevens, but... @SenWarren
.@ChrisMurphyCT said it right: The @SenateGOP have decided to sell weapons to ISIS.
Please share: @SenWarren just devastated Republicans for killing tonite's gun reform bills: http://occupydemocrats.com/2016/06/21/elizabeth-warren-just-devastated-republicans-killing-tonights-gun-reform-bills-2/ … #DisarmHate
Republicans sure were not devastated in the elections.
another LIAR for the theif,   killary
#DRAINTHESWAMP
Didn't Obama/Hillary, the father/mother, of ISIS arm ISIS enough?
we need dems in the Senate and Congress I can't stand GOP anymore
@MZHemingway Why do we have an open border?   They wouldn't be here at all, if you did YOUR jobs  2/2
BothDems and GOP are guilty. You've endorsed one of the most war hawkish candidates in US history!
Hillary & Obama sent guns to Terrorist in Libya on 911 that murdered 4 heroes!
@senatedems welcome ISIS into the country to murder American citizens. @senatedems should be charged with murder
Oh so true i sure do not want them here for don't trust none of them
The GOP: Doesn't represent the American people but the NRA & gun manufacturers!
is just another demented #democrat sitting at the wrong #terrorism bus stop.
if you had banned Democrats from getting guns, 49 beautiful people in Orlando would still be alive
What ...Who? They are just the JV team, Right?
It has been proven today Obama's redacted transcripts make it ALL ABOUT TERROR NOT GUNS
And you decided to endorse what you 'opposed'. Fraud.
If you see an anti-gun vote as an opportunity to smear @SenWarren you are not a progressive.
these kids don't know what progressive is thanks to Bernie. They have been bamboozled
When you are bamboozled you don't get to judge on who is being bamboozled.
Look up the specifics of #FastandFurious :Eric Holder & Obama have their fingers all over gun activity @SenWarren @ChrisMurphyCT @SenateGOP
or the 2nd, 4th and 14th amendments to the Constitution are still in effect, but whatever.
FUNNY, CLINTON HAS BEEN DOING IT FOR YEARS,  MOST OF ISIS WEAPONS WERE MADE IN THE USA
funny considering track records of who has actually run guns to them and cartels. #FastAndFurious
How funny they caught Hillary doing it. You just can't make this stuff up anymore.
Elizabeth Warren is the lefty version of Sarah Palin. So stupid. Even sounds like her. #LipstickOnAPig
This is 10x more inflammatory than what McCain said about Obama.
@SenWarren @ChrisMurphyCT @SenateGOP
people, people ... the correct moniker for her is FAUXCAHONTAS.  TIA
This " woman" if she is one , is a moron. If anyone is at fault it's odumbo.
you decided to endorse Hillary Clinton, who was involved in multiple weapons deals with dictators.
don't change the subject. Yes or no, should suspected terrorists be allowed to buy an AR-15?  If your answer is yes... Shame
Should they be allowed to own cell phones or use the internet?
let's start w not letting them but AR-15s. Too much to ask?
This is America, @warrenleightTV. We do not subordinate natural rights to the whims of cowards. Got PROOF someone is dangerous? Arrest him.
this may sound kind of stupid, but what about limiting ammo sales kind of like how they limit OTC pseudofed ?
I know people want to do something - but the wrong thing to do is make it harder for the law abiding to fight back.
I know I said "limit" but I meant it like just keep a list of who buys a big bunch of ammo - just trying to be helpful
For U.S. citizens the NRA is a much deeper & darker & deadlier melanoma than ISIS could ever be.
I'm the @NRA (member) so you're accusing me of being a terrorist ... so f* you.
Nothing so horrid as that. Of course you're not a terrorist. You're an enabler of terrorists. And I know u don't mean to be
he's accusing a law-abiding Jew (me) of enabling Islamic terrorists ... somethings you just can't make up
I'm really accusing the NRA leadership. They won't even do what the majority of NRA members want them to do.
What's that, overthrow?
I thought we were racist islamophobes?
Cognitive dissonance: the left calls gun owners racist islamophobes. Then claims we’ll sell guns to terrorists. @NRA @JohnRLottJr @gunpolicy
Once again, you cannot have it both ways. Seek help, woman.
Cognitive dissonance: the left calls gun owners racist islamophobes. Then claims we’ll sell guns to terrorists. @NRA @JohnRLottJr @gunpolicy
.@SenWarren A registered Democrat literally decided to join ISIS and kill 49 people.
.@SenWarren who was it that decided to go into Libya & Syria 2 help create ISIS? Oh yeah, Hillary & Obama
Numbnuts. Operation Iraqi Failure created ISIS. Removing Hussein created the unrest. Bush/Cheney. 2003
BO has no responsibility at all -- and you call others numbness Bwahahaha GFY
Your reply makes no sense. GFY dumbass.
Doesn't make sense to you because you're a moron And what part of GFY did you not understand?
So block me dumbass. Nonsensical twit.
Who do they think they are?That's Obama's job!
Member that time DNC said it was wrong & unpatriotic to link a US politician to ISIS? It was yesterday
That sounds like hate speech. You should be ashamed. Typical liberals.  #2A
Hey Sparky, have you LEARNED to be that stupid, or is it something congenital?
and @NRA is the the broker for the arms deals.
REALLY?? Ha ha that is crap! Sen Warren is a liar!!
Oh Robert that is rude! Your just like ALL LIBERALS BIG MOUTH & NO FACTS!
49 dead!!!
Obesity kills far more people than guns. Why aren't you railing against cheeseburgers
Well there we are,the real problem underlining mass murder
That was sarcasm.The real problem is as absurd. Blaming guns not radical Islam.
Shut don't go up prices do so take my advice and shut-up to.
If you have to ask then off of me & stuck on you.
Like I said off of me and stuck on you.  Can you read?
You just lost any right to complain about Trump's rough discourse.
look another lie by the ever decietful #pocahontas
Pocahontas @SenWarren doesn't have a fucking clue for a wannabe injun Squaw
And the registered Democrat that just slaughtered 49 people? Your thoughts please
Whoa, slow down with the lying there, Hillary Jr.!
so did the Democrats by this reasoning, Obama administration gave them for free!!!!
How do you say that in your native tongue?
oh man, I might have to 'borrow' that one.  Well-played.
yeah, after all, blatant, overt racism is working out SO well for Trump.
Typical liberal always calling someone a racist. You liberals always resort to name calling because you can't carry on an intelligence debate about anything.
Due Process? Innocent until proven guilty? Dems, the party of Fast & Furious.
Very true!!! They did something so I can't tweet about it right now! Give me a few I will figure it out Them scumbags 
@HillaryClinton @POTUS were running guns from Libya to Syria so who armed ISIS?
hehe let us not politicize a tragedy. You're right. It was a crazed Pat Robertson OD'd on Chickfila
@MZHemingway  Do you think ISIS could buy weapons here if we vetted the "Refugees"? 1/2
.@SenWarren How so Cupcake? Where are these sales going on?  First I've heard of them.  SOURCE?  @ChrisMurphyCT @SenateGOP
Fear mongering at its finest. Speaking of arming ISIS, do you realize who you've endorsed?
you are correct. The reason we have ISIS is the failure of Obama and Hillary. Warren is one of the worst of senate.
Wait, didn't @POTUS @TheJusticeDept LITERALLY SELL WEAPONS to drug cartels? Thanks for the BS, Senator.
Why would ISIS pay for weapons when Obama gives them weapons for free?
Murphy and Warren are both FOS as usual
You endorse the woman who did everything in her power to arm them.
Really?
The GOP have just announced to America that they are the real terrorists.
You've made it clear you're too ignorant to comprehend it. @SenWarren @ChrisMurphyCT @SenateGOP
@apricotmamiof2 @ChrisMurphyCT @SenateGOP Yes. And Manchin, Heitkamp too. Horrid.
I'm a Democrat but I say VOTE THEM OUT !!! Gun Safety before party loyalty!
My saying is "Country before Party".  They don't listen.
GunFirst Dems need to be sunk with the GOP.
Bernie Sanders is 1st on that list.  I agree, they need to go.
Bernie Sanders is on a separate list of non-Democrats who need to go.
Bernie voted right today. Devil his due.
So #Isis is here legally buying weapons? @SenWarren you should talk to the @fbi @ChrisMurphyCT @SenateGOP be patriotic and help w illegals
that silly bitch is crazy. Did she mention there were indians who wanted weapons?
Yes, she called a one general Custer. @rjkok2 @SenWarren @FBI @ChrisMurphyCT @SenateGOP
the  squaw is gonna block you dude.
Won't be the first Democrat to block me. @rjkok2 @SenWarren @FBI @ChrisMurphyCT @SenateGOP
Did they donate millions to the Clinton foundation 1st? Luv the kick back!!
TRUTH...Let's hope @CNN 
@MSNBC will Report this tonight instead of 
#TrumptyDumpty
I see you blindly follow Squaw Warren
Idiot...you are blocked..
you are doing a great job.
That is a very hateful thing to say about @ @SenateGOP ChrisMurphyCT so let's #DisarmHate
From Italy, here. I am shocked. Why? Why?
Because we have a Constitution. The gov't cannot strip the rights of citizens without due process.
But was it really a change in your Constitution? Or just a regulation of weapons' use under the law?
It would violate Constitution. The 5th/14th Amends guarantee citizens due process under the law
The GOP thrives on terror. What would they fear monger without it?
Who exactly is fear mongering here?? Also, Warren voted "nay" so she is a fraud
only one party has a record of trafficking weapons. Hint: it's not the GOP
All administrations allow international weapons sales.  Get real!!
um no. This is what happens when people like YOU down play problems and play PC games.
Kris Williams! I Love You for your comment!  From The Silent Majority
she is useless. So tired of her smug BS.
She's tied to those crazy Clinton's!
shes acting insaner than usual (i think in a desperate act for VP) #nothankstimestwo 
Send her a demonologist to exorcise the Clinton Corruption from her soul or a Shaman since she is NativeAmerican.
democrats have sided with ISIS and allowed them move freely in America.
Wampum Warren speak with forked tongue. Need go back to wigwam in hurry.
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! You and Murphy really crack me up, Fauxcohontas!
but it's okay when your buddy Barry does it right?
Pocahontas is a liar.  the dems voted down Republican bills to restrict the sellof weapons to terrorist
While Obama armed Mexican cartel and Syrian Rebels that were a part of ISIS! Stupid phony woman!
Obama and Hillary are way ahead on arming ISIS. What wrong with you liberals?
so you voted for the Cornyn amendment?
U r unbelievable. NO,the Democrats decided 2 enable ISIS by supporting Obama's middle east "policies".
Y'all didn't have a problem arming ISIS before, or sending full auto AK's to Mexico! #shutuppocahontas
the #isis shooter was #democrat
While Obama's folly in Libya, Iraq, and Syria just gives ISIS weapons instead.
Instead of just letting them have them like u did.
Thank you for celebrating your birthday sitting with @HouseDemocrats #NoBillNoBreak #HoldTheFloor @MomsDemand
Justify your actions!!! How are we the public supposed to protect ourselves from these animals?
Yeah! We should have camps and armbands for people on the No Fly List! #StandWithElizabeth
You better get up off that floor before you need to get a hip replacement.
you madam, are a despicable liar. You have no shame. No morals.
she's straight jacket crazy HC thru her back channels sold 1/2 of US uranium supply 2 Russia
You let Iran have nukes.
Pocahontas go away
She's still mad her ancestors sold manhattan to the pilgrims for $24.00
Pocahontas is the original Cherokee Hair Tampon creator #SouthPark
#1.The GOP stopped your Lib. adgenda. #2.Your buddy is who sells weapons to the enemy. #FastAndFurious
Elizabeth I think u got it WRONG, @BarackObama is the One who's selling GUNS TO ISIS,NOT THE GOP
Uhmm... too late @Hillary and @Obama already sold weapons to ISIS - remember Benghazi?
this is outright slander, you should be removed from office. What about selling guns to cartels?
Obama and Hillary founder ISIS
please shut up fauxahontas
read the Consitution. The 5th Amendment. NO Person...shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property w/o due process of the law.
You've now vindicated all the Republicans who've been told it's immoral to compare Democrats to ISIS.
U will never b her VP running mate. @HillaryClinton will never share spotlight w/another woman. Put that in ur pipe & smoke it.
You speak forked tongue. Hillary/BHOzo gunrunners.
u have Crazy rhetoric that's 100% Untrue!
@TheDemocrats @POTUS @HillaryClinton No no Fauxahoness That would be your BFF Hilldabeast & Ovomit that did that
Oh fuck yourself illuminati scum.
utter hyperbole.  Let's not forget fast & furious
yeah. Page from BHO's Fast & Furious playbook. Shame the DNC is hellbent on giving jihadist amnesty.
do you even keep track of what country our state department sells weapons to?
@SherryLuvsAdam @ChrisMurphyCT @SenateGOP And Hillary and Obama  just gave weapons to ISIS
So says the FAKE INDIAN! Princess Lies A Lot!!! Run along clown!!
No no no, that was Obama selling guns to the Mexican Drug Cartels, remember?
The @SenateDems lie and deceive while dancing in #OrlandoTerrorist blood. #ItsAboutTerrorismStupid
#HeyPocahontas...as well as @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton creation of #isis.
Hillary put them in business you crazy old cow.
Ok, so Mateen was ISIS? Got it. Thanks for finally clearing that up!
@POTUS Decided that years ago!!
.@SenWarren @ChrisMurphyCT @SenateGOP really? How so?
That is idiotic.  Dems voted to take away Constitutional rights without due process.  #72Hours
Pesky pesky facts...
Said the supporter of Fast and Furious and that Clinton selling favors to Gay Killing countries. @ChrisMurphyCT @SenateGOP
say the ppl backing the admin that provided high-capacity firearms to Mexican drug cartels!! #FastAndFurious
Go back to your wigwam.
pretty sure the us gov sold them weapons before they were even isis.....
The NRA and GOP do t sell weapons. You want officials to break their oaths, just like you!
ISIS couldn't buy the weapons if Pres #Obama didn't let them in.  Just saying...
You and your lying friends should be held accountable for these lies and fabrications! Tell the truth!
lizzy continues to piss off the wrong people... how the hell does someone like her get elected?..(1of2)

dumbest shit I've heard in a long long time 
Considering that ISIS is a result of democrat policies, you have a lot of gall.
Which Party did this? http://edition.cnn.com/2016/01/21/politics/john-kerry-money-iran-sanctions-terrorism/ …
Fast and Furious ring any bells Lyinwatha??
.@SenWarren .@ChrisMurphyCT @SenateGOP So all this talk about being one (and good) country... just a shrill talk at the opportune moment.
.@SenWarren .@ChrisMurphyCT @SenateGOP "They" were elected by your fellow Americans, just like you were. I DESPISE both sides, by the way.
that was the Democrap known as Hillary Rodham Clinton. #DemocratLies
too late the state department was already doing that.
#PotmeetKettle
Liar. Hillary Clinton did that when she was SOS with your blessing.
Dems can give guns to Mexican drug cartels and Syrians, but want to keep Americans from having them.
@SenWarren @ChrisMurphyCT @SenateGOP
@walterolson @Radioviceonline And then there is Fast and Furious
Didn't the justice dept say we'll never know his motive or allegiances? Christ at least be consistent with your BS
you ma'am, get the golden trophy for all time crazy person. You can't fix stupid, and apparently, you can't fix crazy. GET A GRIP
no, senator, the dems do that already.#Benghazi. And you support the butcher of benghazi. #NeverClinton
Oh shut up.
Don't mess with me you drunken mouse! I am a direct descendant of Hannah Dustan!
@SenateDems  blocked 2 valid measures.
, Indians call this speaking with a forked tongue
Hillary and Obama did that in Syria (with arms redirected from Libya) - armed jihadis in Libya, too. @ChrisMurphyCT @SenateGOP
You are both horrible
but potus AG et al are saying that orlando wasnt isis it was a hate crime????!!!!
Afraid they'll cut into your nominee's business? #Benghazi
Obama & @HillaryClinton armed ISIS http://mobile.nytimes.com/2012/12/06/world/africa/weapons-sent-to-libyan-rebels-with-us-approval-fell-into-islamist-hands.html … @SenateGOP #DemsPartyofTreason #Benghazi
Shameful, inflammatory & innacurate. You're advocating witch hunts under guise of gun control
you must be out of your mind!
Gitmo is bad but watch lists that ban civil rights of actual citizens without due process is tots cool?
, I thought you were elected to represent all of us. Your statement is as truthful as your Cherokee DNA.
No wonder Pocahontas has no respect from Trump!  Know facts before tweeting!    #TRUMPTRAIN  
She sounds like Harry Ried lying about Mitt Romney and his income tax...no difference...just a LIE !
Pocahontas uses Jihad for political gain. A free people should be able to protect themselves.
more like they decided not to let ISIS win by standing up for due process and liberty. #ThePpl #2A #5A
Why, is ISIS a problem?
throw grandma off cliff, killed my wife, didn't pay taxes... Add to the list of idiotic rants
How does that statement even make sense?
I'll put this in my "dumbest tweets ever" file.
the Obama administration literally allowed Iran to expand its nuclear program
The @SenateGOP want to sell guns to ISIS about as much as dems want to help Americans. Completely false. @SenWarren @ChrisMurphyCT
but it's the @TheDemocrats that is letting #isis in to be able to make purchase 
# propaganda
Warren is mearly a plagiarizing , Lying progressive who sucks the gov teet. You guys need to stand up & push back
Republicans are more worried about gun sales than stopping domestic terrorism
Just dems using the dead for personal profit. #demvalues.
Obama has literally been selling to ISIS and "moderate Muslims" since the Arab spring you supported.
L I A R
What good does it do our citizens to lie? Why didn't you support due process and the Cornyn Amendment?
@SenWarren @ChrisMurphyCT @SenateGOP
