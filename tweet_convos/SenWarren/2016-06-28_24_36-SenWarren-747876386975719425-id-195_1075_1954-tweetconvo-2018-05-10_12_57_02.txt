Dishonest? You lied about native blood to steal a Harvard education and job from the First Nation people.
McConnell is an ass. He was one of the guys that sealed some of his records when he got to office. They hide stuff
Hi again Ms. @LynnePatton*Peck* Pls make sure that @CoachKJunior is aware one reason why Harvard hired Sen. Warren.
Actually the chances of her coming from Oklahoma and having no Native American DNA is pretty damn slim
How did she steal from the taxpayers?
It's hard to believe we're trying to have a rational argument with a Trump supporter....
can a mosquito tell the difference between republican women and any other.Native plants deter mosquitoes;toss seeds
@pamcurtis4210 @SenateMajLdr Boil over Senator that's when your at your best !!!! #ImWithHer
The fake NativeAmerican who lives in opulence(while real 1s starve)thinks #Zika-bill's only good if it contains her words re guns
@brighamboi @SenateMajLdr 
Give em shit, Elizabeth!
That is the same way we feel about HRC and her antics.
instead of tweeting,get off twitter and your ass and YOU write a bill
@DevolutionMan @SenateMajLdr When did you stop being upfront and honest with your constituents? We are not your children, you...
...have no right to deceive us. It is time to change the laws surrounding how bills are written!
1 topic 1 bill! Or be replaced... Rise up America, let's put a stop to the children playing politics
Will the @SenateMajLdr rspnd to these tweets? Why be on twitter unless you only care about your popularity #BeAMan
I want farmers, coal mnrs, min. wage workers and REAL fam folks in office! Time for a fresh start
Do the job right and you don't have to worry about where you're polling... #NewPoliticiansPlease
If you looked you'd see people were reading them. Twitter is not a place for the illiterate, sorry you don't like my tweets.
your Cherokee Indian blood or your white blood? Oh that's right, you DON'T have any Cherokee blood do you?
When you said dishonest I thought you were talking about Hillary.
not worried about babies, need more money for planned parenthood is the real dishonesty of Democratic party
1.9 billion? Ludicrous! Ask yours & Hillary's friends the Saudis to  pitch in. Perhaps the Clinton Foundation pitch
My blood is boiling over the fact that you are a pathetic, dishonest & malicious person, just like your pal Clinton.
they are liars and deflectors of the truth.  They don't ever tell what they've done...
It can't be, you are not human and have no blood! You are a cold human being and I feel sorry for you.
Then tried to say it was Dems fault it didn't pass.
@Coeleborn @SenateMajLdr present legislation to eliminate riders on bills.
@RustinAustin @SenateMajLdr 
It's not "terrorism" when Congressmen hold American lives hostage over amendments to hurt others?
Go back to the reservation.
Harvard.

@mtbum63 @SenateMajLdr They're playing politics with children's lives @elizabethforma.  Shameful!

.@SenWarren @SenateMajLdr If we had a WALL and no ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION zika wouldn't be an issue!! #immigration
Are you pissed off that your BFF while SOS lost 6 Billion $? Why haven't you called for an investigation?
Native-American blood?? Fauxahontas should be quiet
When isn't your blood boiling over? You're an angry shrew.  @SenateMajLdr
Get back to your bong Granny
this from the pantsuit that wouldn't take her husbands last name cause it was "Mann". Feminazi 1st class
Why?  Because it was limited to Zika, and not other pork like planned parenthood? Phony lib-prog!
Because you will sit on the floor and tantrum like a petulant child unless you get everything you want?
What does PP have to do with Zika funding? WHO is dishonest? Are you nuts?
is that your Indian blood or your feminist pantsuit blood? Be more specific
how come ur blood doesn't boil about selling baby parts? You're a joke
the weasels known as the GOP must think we are stupid esp women well I believe in Nov we will show them our power!!
@TomLevenson @SenateMajLdr well, make your case clearly, cause GOP madly tweeting Dems are irrationally holding it up
Republican'ts are saving our tax dollars so they can spend them on the next war
@badwebsites @SenateMajLdr
What abt ur #DemocraticSitIn to boost fascist use of lists we can't get wrongly named removed from?!
My blood is boiling also, at the fact that you are supporting HRC... You're a joke, and I'm sure you accepted $$ to endorse her..
Why was it dishonest? What did they try this time?
.@SenWarren .@SenateMajLdr 
Thanks Ms Warren more of US should be getting heated up by now over the scorched earth politricksters in the GOP
You democrats voted #zika bill down  Because you want funds for your baby killing factory, shame your momdidnthave1
AMERICANS blood boils over your lies and Nazi tactics.
So worried about the Zika, you sure your boy didn't have this released to distract from his import of terrorist
Can the GOP explain why it was important to defund the ACA by $500million?  Allow poisons into rivers? #GOPValues
only thing Republicans in congress did was spend 7 million dollars trying to bring Hilllary down. Gangsters pack !
meh, he thinks that wealthy white families won't be affected.
@SenWarren @SenateMajLdr
You have blood running through those veins?
I know what you did last summer
Your party's almost done with @SpeakerRyan Enjoy your hypocracy while you can.
If Mrs warren would quit tweeting and start working she might actually earn her pay. She's trying to distract us.
@LEngelhorn @SenateMajLdr Really?  My blood is boiling that children starve and die each day to protect the wealthy from taxes
What does her stmt. have to do with yours?
Grow a brain and maybe you'll figure it out.  The irony is list on you people
irony is thT wealthy ppl pay vast majority of taxes already. Grow a brain u tool
you do realize that the wealthy pay most of the taxes,..right? Are u willfully ignorant or just a liar?
You're on drugs.  Try looking up some facts.
@Amathyst25 @dmmaster13 I run my own business, I'm pretty well off, I pay huge taxes and I also just fed some children.
so do I. I pay a massive amount. And somehow I need to pay more?
my blood is boiling over you selling out to the American people, being see with Hillary, that ok though I am from MA
Hey @SenateMajLdr do you really think Dems arent paying attention Pack your bags because in Nov we are taking back the Senate
More "I got mine" corruption. Then 2 spend $7 million of our money for their witch hunt!! MAKE ONE VOTE COUNT AGAIN
Are you a Massachusetts Senator or a puppet for Clinton's?
They have a slash and burn mentality. It is going to get very ugly GOP fire sale.
@wrldstrndupside @SenateMajLdr -It is despicable! Partisan provisions should NOT be in the Zika bill! That was a crappy.
and my blood is boiling at the thought of you using the Native Americans as a spring board for your career,
@SheWhoVotes  That just who they are 
agree
But your blood isn't boiling over the dishonest and malicious things HRC has done?! WTF....you are such a sell-out.
is that the native American blood or democratic LYING CORRUPT CROOKED blood November TRUMP PRESIDENT balance budget
too bad you arent outraged at 4 dead American men in Benghazi you hypocrite flake Warren.
Majority of US agrees with you. The bill is a joke as is the Majority Leader.
Promise us you'll explode!
My blood is boiling over this but are you cool with it?
It's a shame to see @TheDemocrats betray their values and vote against policies that help Americans. #DemPlatform 
.@SenWarren @SenateMajLdr Sen. McConnell lies - it wasn't about Zika at all. It was about the Confederate flag & anti-abortion language
@SenWarren @SenateMajLdr
oh you're saying mean things. Racist, bigot, sexist, globalist, anti-Semite.
It will take months after infection for microencefalic Zica neonatals to be born, but Brazil's exp guaranties it.
and Democrats defeated it; good going Pocahontas!
@realDonaldTrump @DanScavino @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle

Goofy nobody cares what you say
@LeChatNoire4 @SenateMajLdr   Mitch McConnell needs to pass term limits and catch Trailways.  Today would be a great time!!
my blood boils over the fact that the GOP refuses to confirm the #SCOTUS nominee. Illegal?
Breathe Sen Warren, we know and were with u. They keep trying to sneak rat poison in our cheese but we smell it.
@MattMurph24 @SenateMajLdr But it's nothing new...
@MattMurph24 @SenateMajLdr It's positively horrendous.  So why can't the GOP just be honest and say they want to screw everyone?
everything you say is weakened by the fact that you endorsed Clinton, knowing what you know.
no Zika crisis,why aren't infected quarantined until it's safe for them to be bitten by our mosquitos,no spending
My blood is boiling over the pathetic, dishonest & malicious neoliberals rejecting progressives, risking a President Trump.
The American public has come to expect the Congressional GOP to do nothing of substance. They are pathetic crooks.
ur repeating ur self and expecting new results...u know what they call that...do it again...n again
calm down it's probably just a hot flash
senator Warren, your blood must be boiling over from trumps job speech.
Did or did you not just vote for a bill that violates due process to gain political pts? Goes both ways, right? @SenWarren @SenateMajLdr
time for a sit-in?
@MWJ1231 @SenateMajLdr And as long as he is in power, he will try to pass it until he does or is out of power.
And Republicans wonder how they got the nominee they did #doyourjob
What are they thinking? They're supposed to protect the public. Such a disgrace.
@The_Trump_Train bloodNot boilingOverPathatic dishonestmalicious coverupof FastFurious1000'sMayanINDIANMex GENOCIDE
how do I build a teepee
We're all sick of your complaining and covering up for @HillaryClinton
but no boiling over #Benghazi? #Pocahontas
is it her "Native American" blood that's boiling? #fraud
just another attempt at redistribution of tax payers funds?
@JeffreyLuscombe @SenateMajLdr GOP are like mosquitoes buzz around and then make a sting opeation
At least republicans can spell operation.
@DevolutionMan @SenateMajLdr If you have a bill you want passed then offer it up on its own merit. How did govt due this to you?
@DevolutionMan @SenateMajLdr ENOUGH!!! Take all verbiage not dealing with zika OUT! Then vote! Push your agendas on your own time
People will literally DIE while the GOP plays with their lives. Not Republican just #Repugnant
keep fighting the good fight senator!!!
@aeneapsych @SenateMajLdr No one cares. You blew it.
now u know how we feel for u not supporting @BernieSanders
It's outrageous. It's to the point they are shoving their blatant, pointless crap in our face and laughing.
what have you done since you got in the Senate just asking
The GOP added a Confederate flag rider. To a public health bill?
keep fighting for us please!
lots of folks' blood is boiling over yr political cowardice #stillsanders #NeverHRC #bernieorbust
The GOP in congress is a bunch of slimeballs. They work best in the dark of night when nobody's watching. Shameful!
@Pat120 @SenateMajLdr As I recall most of the cases are showing up in the south a good time  for Dems to move in
Imagine Afghanistan elected Osama as president after killing 3000. Iraq war killed 270000 Iraqi civilians. @SenWarren @SenateMajLdr
Alas, again we are not surprised. They didn't bat an eye spending money to try and smear Mrs Clinton though
I saved you some characters: "My blood is boiling over the pathetic, dishonest & malicious @SenateMajLdr McConnell & the @GOP."
in a country that is so advanced,progress is being hindered by politicians working for power,not for the people!
I’m guessing your blood isn’t boiling so much over Hilary’s insulting student debt forgiveness program?
mine is boiling over the fact that u endorsed someone as horrible as Hillary
Republicans are out of control.
How much did that LYING MURDERING POS HRC PAY YOU to support her SELL OUT!!! Good I'm glad your blood is boiling!
Be honest.You're upset about the fact that they don't wanna fund Planned Parenthood along with Zika. Playing games.
They are SO sleazy!!
@SenWarren @SenateMajLdr
@archivist1000 AND ALL DEMONS~CRATS, REPUBLICAN ELITES AND GOP WHO ARE JEALOUS OVER @realDonaldTrump.
and that you guys stopped so
They conditioned it on allowing Confederate flags to fly on Fed Property. The Party of Lincoln, wants the Flag
of the (Government that opposed him, whose sympathizers murdered him,) to condition funding for a deadly virus on
keeping a traitorous flag on Federal Government property. You can not be Pro-Confederate & a Patriot
drag them queen!
My blood is boiling over yr embracing Hillary.
stay focused @senwarren   Don't let their malicious acts distract you from the work that needs to be done for us.
Your blood boils and anything Republicans do, even if the wanted to carry an old woman's groceries.
Top Three Priorities for the Zika+ Pandemic Now : 

1- Mosquito Control 
2- Diagnostics 
3- Public Education
They should be worried about @realDonaldTrump and his family values !
GOP goes mum on family values. Oh no. I wanna talk about it. @SenWarren @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump
Of Course. It's not their wives and kids getting bitten by it. They just care about themselves & friends.
Tell your F girlfriend @HillaryClinton pack her bags and withdraw for #Benghazi #emails. Period. #Tatiana
back off Tatiana
left wing lunatic Warren keep trashing Trump, no way you & corrupt Hillary can win Indeps like me
just pass the bill! its better then nothing, DEMs are playing this game right now!
@SenWarren @SenateMajLdr
My blood is boiling over from u endorsing Iraq/Libya Hillary. 200,000 innocent brown folks dead #Benghazi
Mine is boiling over your sellout to Clintonism and neoliberal voodoo!
My blood boils at people that betray their supposed principles.
complete shit trying to take Planned Parenthood money away & not give enough 2 Zika. Millions wasted on Benghazi.
if P. Parenthood is so great I'm sure they'll have no prob self funding instead of forcing taxpayers
well,  folks could just not go to zika infested countries to start.
are they all insane.. we need more dems
And my blood is boiling over your political sellout.
still 98.6F with the failed Audit the Fed bill you voted against though right?
Time to go on the warpath.
