Warren send money. Its not as if you don't have it. Mark ohio
Ask her were the 100K went for the MIA Jewish cemetery fund
Hey Pocahontas. Any room left in your teepees for flood victims or did Syrians fill them all up?
Thank you from all of Houston

antifa = bernis and warren supporters
Why are you not there helping? Give them some of the money you took in bribes over the years!
This is why America is the greatest country in the world. We all help each no matter who those in need are, with or without a real President
President Trump is pledging $1 million of personal money to Harvey victims: WH
Don't have to help Trump is there everything is under control!!

seems so many doing so much to help the people and animals in Texas. So what's lardass blubbermouth #Trump doing?
Much more than Pocahontas
Give them some of your millions
Awh
Poor boy got big chip on shoulder.
Wah,wah,wah.
No, it's the truth. Your answer is that of a drug addict.
And your an *****
You got it wrong.......I'm replying to @WhiteCrowTweets. I'm w u ......she should give some of her millions!
Pres. Trump is on top of it. Donate to Red Cross. Beware of groups stealing money, left PACS Linda Soros
What have you personally done? I bet you don't dare to travel to Texas. They know what to do with a New England liberal like you.
She is sending her tribe.
Maybe the Antifa side of the liberal party should help. Oh wait , they are the resistance . Resist resist.
Other than mouthing off you have not given a dime @SenWarren.
Trump and Houston Gov &. FEMA have it under control. Best to Donate $ if you can.
As long as it's at the "people's" expense.
Sure'd be nice see you in TX comforting victims & helping out, Senator—not only because you care, but also to show King Trump how it's done.

Dear @SenWarren, Join me on Aug. 30 for sumptuous #RealIndian Non-#GMO meal to celebrate 35th Anniversary of #Email. Any food allergies? 
Like what are you Doing  I sent in $25  ande you  a big Zero
Can't you just do a Indian sun dance and stop the madness.
Thank all the people of Texas for coming together. Its the American Thing and Right Thing to do
looking for free press? So far, pocahontas has personally done nothing. Donate your money.
Pathetic how Liz is trying to take some credit when she has done absolutely nothing.
Kudos to you Sen. Warren. Cruz did a photo op in Houston. Haven't heard from or seen Cornyn yet.
The POTUS has come to their aid. He's doing a great job. So don't get your panties in a bunch. #wacko
Open your pocket book instead of sending Federal or State funds
@tjeans70 @BostonGlobe Good idea-DJT supporters've been out wth boats rescu'g frm th get go-best fed/State PrePrep in yrs-mayor
We love this country and want to help & contribute specially in these hard times... 
How much of your own money have you donated??
And I guess you want people to believe that you had something to do with it? You are so narcissistic. It really makes me sick.
Don't forget to thank the President for his quick response
Stop fishing for votes!
So I guess we will see you helping out in Houston.    Oh ya I forgot. Liberals only talk a good game.  Now I know why they call you.  Goffus
I wouldn't trust progressives like you if my life depended on it you should resign.
Why do you talk no one wants to hear your rhetoric, just go away your a two face liar and thief.
Are you Happy Trump is doing the Best Job for Texas as a Great President?

Exactly what are you doing on your own Fake Indian Warren..
Never turning down a photo opportunity, @SenWarren promises to tour the devastated TX Gulf Coast in her own personal birch bark canoe...
Red Cross is all about the money. Find a better charity.
Thank you @SenWarren!
Thank you!
Thank you, Senator
Thank you.
@DrusillaRN @BostonGlobe thank you !!

How's the new book going? Sent any of the advance to Texas?
Thank you @SenWarren we need your help.
Keep up your hardwork Senator Warren! I start at Umass next week studying Political Science and Sociology! My  is in Houston!
The only thing you care about is getting rid of Trump. Stop the facade granny
Sadly, @RedCross has proved to be unreliable in times of crisis (http://gawker.com/dont-donate-to-the-red-cross-1652192522 …). I would encourage here: https://ghcfdisaster.kimbia.com/hurricaneharveyrelieffund …
better get on your bike. It's a long ride to Houston ...
Hmmm calling for help in Texas now but can't tell your thugs Antifa and BLM to back off? Typical Warren!
You sound like you "stand for Trump."  You believe that one person is going to tell angry groups how to behave? You need to check reality.
Pocahontas go back to your Tepee
Shut up fraud
Please, #NoTXCharity ... Let Trumps and Tillerson's FEMA do their job.  Don't provide reason so they neglect FEMA at large
#Harvey
Because you'd rather see Trump fail than see America succeed. Pitiful.
Charity is only good when a Dem. is in the WH?
We hav neither a D or a R in the Wht Hous. Your opinion that tens of 1000s mdl class shld fund charities while Mil & Bil aires defund FEMA?
What have YOU personally done for TX? Or anyone for that matter? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
vote democrat and get real help for Americans... not by supporting the new American Nazi Party formerly the GOP
Trump is on the job.
Butt out
We need to keep in mind, this will be a long term relief effort.  Dallas is hoping to have the Convention Center ready for 5000 by tomorrow.
South Texans and Gulf Coast Thank you Sen. Warren!
Seen a check yet?
Yup.  She represents (allegedly) my state. Please don't hold that against me.
At least we will have a chance. I was afraid she would run unopposed. Trump taught me to never say never
Im sure from you there will be a price tag
So go and help instead of shooting off your mouth  ,can't wait till next election so we can be done with you
Why don't you dig up your alleged Native American Relatives to help! I AM Native American and can prove it...show me or shut up..#realtrump
Thank you MA!
Just imagine Elizabeth, if your buddy @HillaryClinton hadn't subverted Bernie, we have him as president and a response to this crisis by now
Did @LockheedMartin #cyber ops goose Harvey w/ covert #RFDE #cyber #weatherweapon to distract from Trump woes? Jrno http://viclivingston.blogspot.com/2011/12/u.html 
Yep, that's it! Lol. Wtf is that? It's a little far fetched. I like a good conspiracy now and then, but that one is too much bud.
You're a Mason. You're all about conspiracies!
Only the good ones.
It's eyes on YOU now.

Thank you Senator Warren. Sincerely, someone who lives in Houston.
Don't believe her Pocahontas speaks with forked tongue
