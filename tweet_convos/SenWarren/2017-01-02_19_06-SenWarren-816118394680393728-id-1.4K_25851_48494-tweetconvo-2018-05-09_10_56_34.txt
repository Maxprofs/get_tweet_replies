@GavinNewsom @GOP make any money from insider trades lately Senator?
and yet you break them all!!
impeach this man now.
You and @CoryBooker need to start thinking about a POTUS run in 2020  That is a ticket I would love to support.
Oh god no
That any Trump supporter would call on God is laughable.
Dear @SenWarren Due respect, but I think the @GOP has conditioned their base to shriek in agreement the second they hear "too many rules."
Another nut job.
I believe it's the rules Washington imposes on the people that they themselves don't have to follow
Elizabeth Warren Did Not Disclose $1.3 Million Credit Line

@SenWarren
OOOOOOOOPPPPPSSSS!  Pocahontas caught in yet another lie!
@gruber @GOP - whatever We have in place is not working- why not change-
The Office of Congressional Ethics was working. Uncovered this:
- the Democrats are no longer trusted period
@Kyvetteleigh @GOP I fear the answer will make us all the madder and a whole lot sadder.
I think you should start acting more like Joe Manchin. Let's work TOGETHER and make this the beautiful united country we know it can be
apparently none of those rules stopped Hillary Clinton from acting ethically. Oh I get it…ethics applies only to the right
Here's some names: Pelosi, Reid, Obama & YOU @SenWarren w @GOP created beard ethics rule STOCK Act, later gutted it in 14sec unanimously
Rules or not. For the job you are sworn to do, we expect ethical and intelligent conduct. Need to be ethical to start with
@jrojasmd @GOP
these fools are digging there own graves by doing this
I wish that were completely true. Unfortunately, they have a few states that will continually vote them in.
true some will never learn no matter what
I do!
no one on the side of country.  The GOP are and have been a mixed bag of nuts, in effort to further devide the country.
you do have too many rules that no one follows including you. Washington is full of bloviating self-serving idiots
YOU DO NOT ROLL BACK OVERSIGHT UNLESS YOU ARE PLANNING TO DO SOME SERIOUSLY SHADY STUFF!
pretty sure they already have done some super shady stuff
yeah... it didnt have enuf teeth. Can you just imagine how much worse it will all get?!  Kiss democracy goodbye.
It's been kissed for the last 16 years.
So  you don't care if member commits a crime?
As far as I'm concerned, a new system is needed. the original did nothing noteworthy
Well love, it's like this. You just gave them a Black Amex and billed it to your house. Enjoy your 
When Congressional Oversight cannot see valid documents, what does an Independent get to see?
You do realize that #pizzagate is a lie, and by tweeting it, you make yourself sound like a nut.
True, but your own conspiracy theories are pretty amusing too.
EXACTLY - It speaks volumes that the first thing the GOP want to do with the New Year is to muddy the swamp even further.



RIGHTTTT.  The regs are there to make sure Gov't is ETHICAL.  Funny stuff
Trump swooped in & saved the day. He wants dirty Dems held accountable.
Trump doesn't give a shit about Party. He wants dirty politicians OUT!!!
Sad that a fake Tweet is more benign than Chump's real ones!
A fake Indian who scammed Harvard to get a $350K per year teaching position is lecturing us on ethics.......
are you saying she lied?   The GOP is not gutting the ethics committee?
Now you want to get Ethical? Seemed to ignore all rules of ethics when Bernie got Cornholed.

Wasn't a deflection, just facts. Ethics is only good when the finger is pointing away.
What an interesting thing to say. Have to think on that, "Ethics is only good when the finger is pointing away."
Notice Liberals love pointing fingers the moment it fits their narrative while turning a blind eye to their own system abuse.
Now who is pointing his ? You realize I have exactly the same opinion of you? Which one of us has had to believe a lie?
Pocahontas   speaks.
Pocahontas, were you a legislator prior to joining congress?
That would be 1/2 of the country. The ppl you @SenWarren choose to ignore or call stupid. Give back money u saved native!!
@misdaws @GOP Trump
I don't recall (39 times)
#demexit #maga #cnn #msnbc #foxnews
the rules allowed the electoral system to degrade and deny the vote to Americans by those who feel they more capable than voters
I that this was shameful. Who would the independent body 4ward report if the pres & rep r dishonest and they r!
We need you to be our Sam Ervin for the next decade, please!
Under OBAMA, nothing was ethical. And Princess Summer, Fall, Winter, Spring... we elected Donald J Trump.
It's obvious the Republicans don't want the rules.

I do !
.@SenWarren  Would really love to do a quick photo session with you Senator!
Take action!  Email your senators!  Tell them no hearings/no votes on Trump cabinet nominees without full ethics reviews!
Is there an ethics rule about claiming to be a native American when you're not?
there are only rules when you deem them as such..... to aid in implementing your agenda... guess what those days are over
threw the Clinton foundation? There was no call then for an ethics investigation.. that implicates all of you as criminals
what rules were in effect when SOC Clinton was selling off favor threw the state department and taking payment by donation..

@susanbr42259458 @GOP @Gop Making Up Crap So They Can Lower The Bar And Make More Money For Their Payoffs!!Deceitful!
.@SenWarren @pjlowden @GOP Rich, coming from someone who claimed Native American status to get ahead. Where were your ethics then, Lizzy?
Does your ethics include being a fake Indian?
I have the same question!  Why was it the first thing they wanted to vote for is to get rid of ethics?
@beining_re @GOP No one. Is there a way to force Trump to release tax returns?
.@SenWarren @beining_re @GOP the real problem is the requirements that are in place are not being enforced!
Exactly.
THANKS for showing how you and your party really feel about our democracy and who won't except the election.
but please keep this up maybe you'll lose even more seats. And the Reps will win again in 2018 and no more big government
but the more you talk about what the Americans voted for and you still are disconnected from the Voters thank you
thank you for doing what you're doing. You're showing who we need to vote for in 2018 with you disrupting democracy
You promoted yourself as a Native American to steal a job from a real Native American! Please no ethics lectures from you!
That would be Trump and other corrupt people.
@ItMustBeNice1 @GOP Thank you! Breaking 40 years of Govt Ethics protocols to rush through cabinet nominees endangers all.
Exactly.  Additionally, proceeding with nominee confirmation hearings without full vetting will only invite corruption.
there are no ethics or morals in the Democratic Party, haven't been for a long time.
we the people!Didn't Nov08 teach you a lesson? Are u really this thick headed? We want our leaders to care about US 4 change
@RepRubenGallego @GOP When will YOU start caring about ethics?
Dems are fine with rules because they're never expected to live by them. Hypocrisy is their calling card
@Fear_NoScience @GOP shut up Squanto
: D'awwww, a monosyllabic, troglodyte who feels like a big, strong white man posting nazi propaganda on the internet.
@Fear_NoScience @GOP
Have too much special interest never working for average Americans you pounding your soap box wanting liberal agenda!!
@vickipwarren go back to tending to your garden. Your not fit to be representing anyone24 @GOP
the problem with Washington is that they don't know know what ethics are. Will u support ted cruz's term limits?
You have no rules, but you want to stifle the people. Your part of the problem and not a real solution, get real.
