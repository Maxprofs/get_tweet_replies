you lost all credibility, you might as well throw in the towel now!
She's another faux progressive.
That's because we will have jobs, instead of having everyone poor and disabled. Read Republicans' tax reform. #easy_work
will #democrats start blocking nominees? still not over your vote for unqualified carson #questionsarenotaction
liar
Your behavior proves why the Dems need to clean house!!!!!  Being a woman doesn't give you privelege to speak for me.
I'm terrified! My son and I are disabled and survive on government help. What's going to happen to us?!
same here. I have a rare brain disorder w/o Medicaid &ssi I will not survive. No meds,docs surgery. I worked &paid in
I fear for me and my son's safety and life without our meds and shelter. The program I'm in if funded by HUD.
I  need #Medicaid to survive! What can I do to STOP this #Medicaidblock from happening?!!

Thank god he has health insurance
I paid that money into SS all my life Now you want senior citzens to live homeless on the street
We have been told since the 70's we would never see it. Where u been?

Maybe the woman in your picture should go get a job. Crazy idea for libs, I know.
<----When Ur Old Enough We'll Discuss Your Drumpf Inspired Ignorance, For Now........@SenWarren @HHSGov @Kris_Sacrebleu
thank you for standing up for principals.  Republicans have no morals.
sad
who are you fooling? The ACA was financed in part by slashing over $250 billion from Medicare.
u lie and suck
I heard that he got scholarships by pretending to be a minority!  Will they come after him retroactively? Maybe U advise?
Thank you so much for speaking out for us I am very worried about losing Medicare and SSecurity
Cory booker is obviously sold out to #bigpharma #cdcwhistleblower

I Love watching you battle,you never let up on them it makes me proud to be a Massachusetts Resident and a USA citizen!
lol a lot of ol people voted for him. Election results clearly show that. U honestly think he's gonna deny them care?
So what happens now the people who shouldn't be will be in office even though its wrong. Wow! we're dead Dems
Hey EW, are you NOT supposed to be sitting in the back seat? No keys for you! Your own rules!
as a senior, who depends on Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid, I am feeling so unsettled and worried.
Wonderful, Senator Warren.  Keep up trying to protect Medicare and Medicaid.  Someone has to care for us.
you slashed $250 billion from Medicare and used the  money on Medicaid. Democrats to Seniors: Drop Dead #MAGA
Why is that we can't fathom the possibility of giving access to medical care for all people?
Financial cuts are good.  He didn't say he would cut coverage.
we pay double for worse outcomes! Avoidable medical error 3rd leading cause of death in USA
medicaid is worthless no doc takes it, and meicare will be broke in a few years. Funny when clinton did it it was fine. LIES!
Senator, did U ever  hear, If you are not part of a solution, U R part of the problem.  Sore loser, my God stop!
I hear that wall is going up very soon
happ finding

Happpy meeting you
When will you commit to not being a fake indian?
please keep working for us Thank you
thank you so much. Keep fighting for us we new you
will we lose our MassHealth Senator Warren? I'm in treatment for addiction I couldn't afford otherwise #scared
Thank you for standing up for the millions of ppl that need the ACA.
Cutting Medicare severely will kill people...maybe that's what they want
GOP had many years to "fix" healthcare before BO. Why do think they have changed? Start stating the obvious!!!
you're saying he wouldn't commit to leaving taxpayers and young people with an enormous tax liability? Great.
people have spoken. You're fired !
He did not say that He said they will be protected in different ways. Thanks to Obama medicare will run out of money.
@JustWhatNowWhy @HHSGov @YouTube JUST SAY NO!
Tell me lies tell me sweet little lies, u love creating questions so that u can TWEET. Guess ur just like trump
Not one of Trump's Cabinet picks give a straight answer to a direct question. Keep asking, Senator. We're with you.
Sen Warren you've been amazing but the gang of Kich Bros Cruz Ryan etc are $$$$$ to bet every accountability
Koch brothers empire is driving their oil coal Death Star
If Obamacare is so good why aren't you on it?
will you #boycotttheinauguration Senator
He won't
you wouldn't let him explain anything because you just kept talking talking talking
Oppose! Obstruct! Deny SCOTUS!
sad to see the protesters tonight no unity in the USA only anger such a great county from the out side lookin in
@Shari2112 @SenWarren @HHSGov  How are people suppose to live?
I don't know how i will.  I'm on Medicare
Senator: these combined programs spend over a trillion dollars annually. Rep. Price should pursue cuts in waste, fraud, & abuse
He was to busy trying trying to keep his nose above water . Great job at the hearing.
thumbs down on him.
OMG
You wouldn't let him give a full answer.
nicely done, Sen. Warren. Price got schooled.
thank you sen. Warren for the topic, may almighty God continue to help and support you...
Thank you for your tenacity. We need an army of voices and spirits like yours!
Shame on them. Our older generation don't deserve this. Nor do I. We work, pay in, it's OURS.
I would not commit to anything..anytime..forever. so you see. You can't catch thesethey are all smarter than you

So we get to look forward to more mass shootings?
Warren is a rude bitter losing disgusting bitch. Grand standing in congress.
I loved how Sen Sanders called him out on the word "ACCESS". I have access to gold bars.. Doesn't mean I can buy them!
Senator Sanders lives upto his credo - You have 14.5 million and encourage anarchy
Then Republicans should refund our money. If I'm not getting anything when I retire, return what I was taxed.
good

:And maybe Tom Price can on confirm what he knows today since Trump isn't Pres. yet. You knew that - right!?!
@RepTomPrice Only a Harvard professor would claim a $380,000,000,000 #Medicare increase is a $449,000,000,000 "cut"
A"NO" vote is in order for Mr.
Price"..
and so he shouldn't...
Liar @SenWarren @HHSGov @YouTube
he wouldn't rule out making ANY cuts let alone massive cuts. Bring out the hacksaw.:(
conflict of interest! Insider trading Do not confirm!!
that's because he plans to make massive cuts and shift all the money to Wall Street...
Of Course NOT...He Want's To Disable Them!
So impressed with @SenWarren 's  questioning at the hearing.
THANK YOU Senator Warren. Keep shedding light on the total lack of qualifications of these nominees. DO NOT CONFIRM THEM.
Thank you for asking the tough questions and representing the people well! @realDonaldTrump LISTEN to the people!
Try rephrasing your question to reflect the power and authority and limitations of Secretary of HHS.
Elizabeth for prez! @UrbanPolicy @HHSGov @YouTube
his ability2 cause harm along with ACA killers r going 2 cause genocide on the American people tht depend on it.
Thank you for everything you're doing!  Keep it up, gurl!!
do you own that jacket in every color? #angryelizabeth
Tom Price says repeal/replace plan will not have people "lose coverage."  Mark it down. 1/18/17 10:48 a.m.
@BrendaLalonde7 @HHSGov @YouTube These hearings are a set up for people into saying things that are impossible to predict
The health and welfare of we, the people, needs to be paramount.
unacceptable appointment.he's a depraved individual that wants to make people suffer. He has no place in our government
Go get them! ! You @SenWarren are my hero!!!!!!
It's his MISSION to institute massive cuts in medicare and medicaid.
Shut up!
He could care less about those of us who need medicare&its supplemental.He is just another ego lackey.
mr. Price cannot commit to protecting Medicare or Medicaid then he don't need to be in office he'd hurt me
he can tweet it like his soon to be "commander in chief" does.............#2tweetingidiots
Price, tillerson and mnuchin affirmations letting the rats guard the cheese
.

𝐁𝐔𝐓, 𝐁𝐔𝐓...

.
Let them try. Or
touch Social Security. Maybe time to impeach a pres. Trump
almost begging us IMO
Please continue to stand up for Liberty and Justice for all Americans.
If you fact checked Warren, you'd find she's around the same % as Trump.  Except she's aware she's lying.
please save Medicare, Medicaid, ACA and sic security!
And you think calling her name's in a public forum will get people to listen to YOU, Shirley?
All programs need to be evaluated for waste and abuse with the intention of not hurting the participants
Warren you and your fellow corrupt Dems sold American workers short while filling your pockets. Pathetic.
I guess you get your info from fox  I will set back and watch as the reputations destroy America
please keep up the work you are doing. Love will win #notmypresident
Haven't seen anything so disgusting since 13 Democrats blocked cheaper medicine for the American people. Oh wait.

@RepTomPrice is a nightmare to our country's healthcare system! VOTE NO!!
Medicare/Medicaid/Social Security are popular programs w/ support from BOTH sides. But wealthy elite DGAF about us plebs.
CRAZY E. WARREN WILL NEVER STOP!
@SenToomey Protect our access to good healthcare. Protect PA. #NotmyAMA #RESISTANCE #DoctorsforACA
nope.. Fake news. Research yourself don't just regurgitate talking points
.@SenWarren   I thought you asked him about cutting a single dollar, you are as literal about "massive" as you are heritage... #Fauxcohontas
Do you work? Do you pay into SS? If so, you should be concerned. All of us. It's not panic, it's tru.
thank you for what you do.  It's hard not to just give up... You and Sen.  Sanders give me hope.
Nor any of your colleagues came out with a plan to save it without soaking the middle class to oblivion #GlassHouses
