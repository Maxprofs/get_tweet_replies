Senator Warren, you have got to get this man out of the WH. I am going to have a stroke!!!
Sure.  Maybe their number are looking down while students start looking up at their accounts @SenWarren @Navient @washingtonpost @CFPB
Don't give up!! #NotMeUs #TuesdayMotivation #Transparency

: Spineless CEO who will not take responsibility for his actions.
@wdshryock @Navient @washingtonpost @CFPB Why are we not blocking ppl from Carson onto Tillerson. They know nothing of those jobs
No more punching down on working class. Time to punch back #JustUs http://jmcam80.wixsite.com/jmcussenate 
No one believes you senator when you lie about actual borrowing stats.
they didn't allocate a payoff payment as I had instructed and only fixed it when I showed proof 
This is why we need to #DefendCFPB
@Barbie892 @Navient @washingtonpost @CFPB Way 2 go,  having a sense of responsibility.
AES needs an investigation too. Absolutely awful.
nope he actually said they are more interested in making money off him than to create rules to help people
When did he realize this? @bman1126 @SenWarren @Navient @CFPB
idk I don't speak with him daily
They sure take a lot of our money every month with no accounts to apply it to.
We filed a complaint with CFPB. only to have navient respond that we do not have accounts there.
LOAN SHARK!  WONDER HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE SWIMMING WITH FISHES!
Wells Fargo whined too.....keep companies accountable.
The topic is about student loan fraud. Hold Navient accountable #IamNavient  @beachbumparis @SenWarren @Navient @washingtonpost @CFPB

@DaniDougPost Thanks for staying on top of the real government/business agenda, taking the money.
drag them.
Think Obama was told he didn't have a chance? W/  that name and black? DT is white, rich, & a man.
I almost barfed up my breakfast listening to Spicer whine about the bad, bad press DT is getting.

Wow, I cannot believe I am going to say this but...YOU GET EM SEN. WARREN! BITCH SLAP EM!
snowflakes

keep telling the truth Elizabeth. These guys are crux just like trump.
no surprise. They are very good at that. Actually the greatest!
name a CEO who is not a whiner?  Their failure is always someone else's fault. @Navient @washingtonpost @CFPB
Hope this time people at the top get prosecuted, if the evidence is there.
Kick their behinds Elizabeth.. I know lots of people they have screwed over..waaa waaa waa..karma
wish I was able to be part of the state you represent so well. Thank you strong woman for being a leader.
Amen.

all while cutting payments to our doctors and denying testing left and right
thank you @CFPB watch them closely, @Navient it ruining my life!

I have a loan with them from a previous college. They take so much money!
hope the @CFPB comes down hard on @Navient , the stories of Navient's #abuses were eerily similar to my wife's own experiences.
a 6 fig household income should not be choosing between paying the mortgage and paying student loans every month.
. Love u Betsy
Senator, guess your not a fan of "Due Process"
Keep fighting for us, Senator Warren!
Too bad you didn't back Bernie.
