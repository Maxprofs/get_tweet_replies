You should condemn the senseless rioting of Democrats.  Respect the result. #Election2016
Okay.  You stick with that theme. #ElectionResults
Right.  Now you don't respect America's democracy.
Did you fail math?
@MishaMishaps @realDonaldTrump Trump doesnt represent their idiotic values, that's why he is President #MAGA
and yes he does
If he was, someone should tell the Blacks, Women, Muslims, Gays and Hispanics who voted for him
people vote against best interest
America can think for itself and it has spoken
yeah they have and she has over 1 millon more votes.
And they won her what? Popular vote? Who won won the election again
it means more people voted for her overall. So actually more people approve of her and not trump
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump
Yeah! It's from the 2010 Republican gerrymandering, dolt.
no it's not not at all!  You don't lose gov seats or senate seats due to gerrymand
You must not even understand what gerrymandering is. Go back to high school civics, unless you haven't taken it yet.
your attitude is why democrats keep losing!  This better than you attitude!
Have you seen Trump? Progressives need more better than you attitude and less rolling over to the alt-right in this country.
no you needed to not abandoned huge demographics of Americans!  Lost because dem
Also, Hilary got 2 million more votes than Trump, who only won because of the Electoral College. He clearly doesn't have a mandate..
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump Actually Liz, the president, obama to be clear, is a bigot & hates America, you have done nothing!
@HearHereParent @realDonaldTrump 

Here you go:
there is alot of things our president should do.hwever,he hasnt done anything-racial division,cops/backs dying
All everybody sees is you running your mouth and every time you open it makes you look  even more pathetic
You're a bigot--HATE EVERYONE WHO VOTED FOR TRUMP.  LOSER. We laugh at you--you're so stupid.
why would he do that he agrees with them?
YES. Trump team has no care no respect for the american ppl.
and Hillary supporters have no respect for the constitution
Really? Ibhave respect forbthe constitution. So that I hold a license to make decisionsonpplsfty
go smoke your peace pipe Pocahontas.
We need YOU , Senator Sanders and Corey Booker to lead the Dems. We need heroes!! And we need them NOW!
And wall street fighting progressives should NEVER endorse a Clinton!
Except when the alternative is FAR worse!
In this race, the "lesser evil" was NOT the Republican! A sign of the times, no doubt.
I agree, he was the greater evil.
@unbreakablepenn @realDonaldTrump should??? He did already . Question is what r we gonna do about it 65 mill did not vote 4 him
A President with decency &human values, yes, he is neither. Next, the whole KLAN is moving into the west wing.
get a life, get over it , FRAUD!!!
preach it senator Warren..help them find a loophole to end this madness..God knows that angry man did
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump 

Ahhahaa...Warren. such a demented delusional person. TERM LIMITS!
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump
that picture makes me want to vomit
as obama said elections have consequences and the nation threw out the democrats in even
how do you have any "moral authority" after stealing a position based on a racist lie? Go away please.
Also why @POTUS should condemn the Bannon pick.
AND telling people not to believe the mainstream media, the establishment -"we are on the right side of history"
You should be returning Soros MONEY. You failed to start the killery train? How u paid off everything n still 
Clickbait fake news
@Str84NOH8 @realDonaldTrump Trump takes time to tweet about entertainers who offend him but no time to condemn bigotry and hate
He's a joke. President? I wouldn't hire him to cut my grass. Best when pres is smartest in room.
Shame on you @SenWarren !@realDonaldTrump is your leader now, too. Show some respect.
I really think things will come together. We have to give him a chance now. We cant change it
can't wait til things come together via losing my right to marriage and Mike Pence putting me in an electric chair lmfao
I know what you mean lol Its crazy out there!!! I dont think people realize that the things he said, he said to get votes
@SadMeganGirls @realDonaldTrump
this is true for the legal immigrants not the illegals though
You could have prevented it. You didn't. What stopped you from endorsing @BernieSanders during the MA primary?
demand recount,  senator!
@ShaunKing @realDonaldTrump @Oprah All ppl/ platforms need to discuss the dysfunctional relationship between Blacks & whites. Sol
Condemn bigots? Bigots are people. Why would you condemn people? Wouldn't you rather condemn their actions?

@simplethyme @realDonaldTrump Where's Eric Holder when you need someone tonrestore sanity!
I Love you, Elizabeth!!
@Marina_Sirtis It's worth reminding everyone that he won with only 1/4 of eligible voters. That's a weak mandate
and she won slightly over 16/64 of the vote....she killed it eh?
She also won about 25%. My comment applies again.
sounds like a solid Republican mandate.  Ryan never said the alt Left would agree
OK I'm too tired to do math for you. Buhbye.
Tough shit “pontifex”....  daily reminder that trump is still your president—> today, tomorrow and next week as well
@prowan8 your magic spells have stopped working @realDonaldTrump is President now. Try arguing with logic. #LostWithHer
Pocahontas is just as corrupt as the Clinton's and Soros. #lockallyallup
Yes he should. The rioters are demonstrating intolerance and bigotry!

<--When You're Old Enough to vote we can discuss your ignorance regarding history & politics. In The Meantime....@SenWarren
, keep fighting for us. Not all of "us" have our head in the sand.
Thank you
His words would ring hollow even as POTUS. He has been this way his whole life.
@ryanbeckwith @realDonaldTrump Talk with your own people, Liz. They're the bigots.
well said. Step down Trump-you didn't want the position in the first place
@rosenbergerlm  Boom
@truthmashup @realDonaldTrump. Hard to respect u. U keep adding fuel to fire & protesters can't verbalize why they're protesting
bigots, the protesters are protesting against bigots in President Trump's cabinet.
. And Hillary wasn't. Read emails she dislikes catholic, coloured, poor,  etc.
Oh that's rich: "Elizabeth Warren Spotted Rushing ..."
you do know capitalising communist doesn't make it true, right?
You do know that msm lies through their teeth
And truth news doesn't?
No. Where else are you going to see this?
I love it. You criticize me for having a different viewpoint...
YOUR ARE RIGHT WARREN - then GET RID OF DEMOCRATS - biggest bigots, perverts, liars, KKK !
Wow! Yet you supported Obama, most divisive president as well as anti-white himself. Shut up already will ya?
@mrnanovideos @realDonaldTrump yeah the president doesn't decide who the next president is. Sorry pocahontas.
Hey Liz, get back in your Teepee and sew your chief some new moccasins.
speak for yourself
@natural_burney @realDonaldTrump warren is a pathetic politician!She is a very evil woman &only thinks about herself!#TrumpTrain
@hausfraunyc @realDonaldTrump Move on Elizabeth. #moveonelizabeth
just like Obama did with all Sharpton. Right?
They should also keep out people who falsify their family heritage to play a card.
CAN CONDEMN THE VIOLENT PROTESTORS. NEWS FLASH HES Pres-Elect where have you been? OH Yea WASH.  @Nick_Offerman @realDonaldTrump
You should be condemning the Violence of the Democrat riots going right now where is your accountability?
Violent? What about the vast majority of peaceful ones?
Yeah, we have some dumb ass's. But so do conservatives! And many of those ppl r just rioting.
"JUST rioting" - PACK IT UP, BOYS - ITS JUST SOME HARMLESS RIOTING!
"Just rioting" as in they have nothing to do w/ the actual protesters.
@MishaMishaps @realDonaldTrump I don't hear anyone reprimanding Rev. Al Sharpton for his blantant racism. Give me a break liberal
@melissamalamut @realDonaldTrump Tell me lizzy what went on with that meeting with you and Soros and other leftist ?
is "Lizzy" a dig, like calling her "little girl?" Either have some respect or leave me alone.
That's what we in Mass call her ! Even the political pundants here
@WitchBrain @realDonaldTrump the west wing offices have always been filled with those more than willing to kill ppl of colour
Maybe, but not quite on the organised, industrial scale that appears to be supported here.
I'm talking about overseas military intervention & sanctions.
But now you're talking about internment camps and mass deportations.
I love you, thank you for fighting for all of us!
Sure abt that: "Elizabeth Warren Spotted Rushing Into a Meeting ..."
umm..trump...putin..direct call...what point r u trying to make again
Hopefully one day you'll wake up...
aww,we hope same for you♡but guessing u have no reason a cross may end up burning on UR yard
... but the riots/protesting are a result of Trump.
Ah, ok.. and based on your twitter feed, I can see you have a lot of respect for people.
Context is a thing: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/28/reince-priebus/did-hillary-clinton-call-african-american-youth-su/ …
Deflection. Got it.

AMEN! Hillary Clinton is MY President, in or out of the Oval Office! Thank you Senator Warren for all your help!
@HillaryClinton Meant to include my President in my prior tweet...not enough characters to do so!
really are you seriously expecting this? From whom?
This is all part of my "movement" my SS if you will.
#notmypresident
Shut up fraud. Ask Soros, Schwartz  about the Jews he sent to gas chambers.
you are a piece of work. POTUS should condemn the riots. Trumps is not a Bigot. The left just spews hate!
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump Lady go to your Indian reserve! Stop fueling hate! You don't give a damm, about the people! Just you
Yes, but Obama didn't. Keep on him though!
step off fauxcahontis you didn't build that "WE THE PEOPLE " did 
Poca, who are you calling a bigot? No more lawyers tricks to avoid defamation liability.
Senators should endorse candidates that align w/ their values & offer the best chance to win. Not give in to establishment elites
OH YEA THE DEMOCRATS COULD STOP THIS RIOTING BUT U DONT. JUST BE SURE TO KEEP THEM IN LIBERAL CITY'S TEARING SHIT UP @SenWarren
The why hasn't the current @POTUS said anything about the vandalism created in the ongoing anti-Trump protests?
How is it that U R a 1%er?
U have an est. net worth of 10 mill yet U never worked in the private sector...
Please keep fighting the good fight. We need you.
HE DID.
, when are you going to disavow and condemn your meeting with @georgesoros @realDonaldTrump
Elizabeth Warren 2020!!!!!!!
thank you for fighting, senator. We need you to push back.
Sadly, bigots praise bigots. In other words, they like patting themselves on the back.
And WTF w/all the Nepotism. Ur businesses R  conflict of Interest! Can't wait til U F'up again, we're salivating
obviously, this is what the American voters want.
- OK. You're condemned.
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump how about you democrats condemn your violence
thanks for calling me a bigot. Guess you don't know me at all.
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump Finally, it is time for new leadership in the congress. Love Nancy but her voice no longer resonates
george washington was a bigot
I was trying to keep an open mind- but this appointment is terrible and sad for the country.
Old white woman heap big angry at future Great White Father.
🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒 Thank you! Most of all, thank you for ACTUALLY TAGGING him.
Fight the Good fight, I'm with you.
@JasonLaCanfora @realDonaldTrump POTUS should condemn communists
Where,s your party? You looked crazy with liary on stage, big BAFOON. The best is yet to come, we don,t need your advice. Big 
unfortunately he's the biggest bigot of all...
@DebraMessing @realDonaldTrump once again Senator Warren is our hero.!!!!!
We have a new administration that are just heartless.
.@SenWarren You HAVE TO USE LAW to control these bigots - use word of law that republicans love to stop violations of human rights etc
You go Girl ! Hope more have the courage to speak out
Senators should do their research and not believe MSM nonsense.  Didn't you learn anything last Tuesday???
@ShaunKing @realDonaldTrump So if not him, who....., Hillary?!
looking for you in 2020 #RoadToPOTUS
Haven't found a single opinion piece or vid of Bannon where he directly has said anything sexist, racist or bigoted. Have you?
So very true
@Headerop1 @realDonaldTrump We need your leadership! Helps us all to speak up. Thank you!
I belive this is where the 2nd amendment applies. I suggest American start arming militias & wait to engage @realDonaldTrump
http://truthfeed.com/video-elizabeth-warren-spotted-rushing-into-meeting-with-communist-george-soros/35778/ …
i do believe when Obama was elected he made the same promise transparency in government can we say term limits
Then why are you hanging out with George Soros?
then he needs to condemn you! Obummer And Hillary are bigots like you.

@Honey17011 @realDonaldTrump but trump himself is a BIGOT! #notmypresident

@annehedonia13 @realDonaldTrump I agree this racist bigot  is dangerous back the 1800's
@JuddApatow @realDonaldTrump how are we supposed to believe a game show host is going to bring us together after stirring this up
@crimsonboudoir @realDonaldTrump The leaders of this country should not be conspiring with Sleazy Soros!! #FireElizabethWarren
but it's OK for you to take money from @georgesoros and divide our country
Lizzy YOU have no idea what you are spamming Just your old Rhetoric.
@JasonLaCanfora @realDonaldTrump thanks pocahontas
@DrEricStrong @realDonaldTrump Elizabeth    Why aren't you & the dems denouncing the riots. Accept election & show leadership
they should not listen to any of you dems, you all still don't get it, just get out of the way your the problem
seems like they have taken over to end democracy and start dictatorship! Does it sound familiar?Russia ,germany?
It's hard for him to condemn them when he is one himself.
Until he does this you have NO business offering to work with him on ANYTHING else.
@starfirst @realDonaldTrump
@ComicWisdom @realDonaldTrump does the term slander mean anything to you? Or law suit?
can you just SHUTUP ALREADY!!!
.@SenWarren @SenateDems @realDonaldTrump sorry you suggested working with him yet?
As I said to Markey, what action are you taking? Get a group to talk w/him. Action is worth more than words.
The Hunter's first pride in T-Shirt shopping https://teespring.com/stores/mrc  show your Hunter pride now by shopping
@splcenter @realDonaldTrump keep talking about only the ppl that voted for him. Keep your own ppl in check 1st.
I agree. Bigots have been put in charge of the White House. The president elect included.
; You'll fit in well @CNN after your re-election bid . Propaganda comes naturally to you.
You are a fake and have no argument. If you did you wouldn't use sexism and racism to claim you one. In fact you are the Racist.
why  shd he apologize for smthing ur side created? How you are a senator boggles the mind! So dumb!!!
A little biased #Pocahontas tend to ur own rioting before casting stones from your glass house @BryanFuller @realDonaldTrump
Now do you see why you should've run?
.@SenWarren @lajump @realDonaldTrump wait, so Steve Bannon is the first bigot in Washington?    Cool story.
first openly white nationalist and anti white since well Nixon and you know how that ended
@ake11er @realDonaldTrump Maybe we should all be Americans and support our pres-elect.
there's a difference between not giving pres-elect a chance and disagreeing with decisions made. Not binary.
Shoulda, coulda, woulda!

It's all over but the ROLLBACK.
#MAGA
He has. He's condemning liberals who are the most devisive fools on earth.
Sen Warren don't you think you should be trying to unite the country instead of causing more problems!! Shame!!
@Nick_Offerman @realDonaldTrump your feelings don't "Trump" democracy Chief Warren..... Indian of the night
you got some real problems maybe the Indian reservation can help you!! Nut job get a life
You are going to be one busy Senator!
Stop it @SenWarren. Seriously just stop.
This election was lost playing this kind of identity politics, why double down?
@realDonaldTrump
Instead of beating a dead horse, reform the democrats. Kick the corporatists out. Make sure you WIN in 2020.
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
WE LOVE YOU DONALD!
Is this you Pocahontas?

Please help us. Someone has to be able to stop a take over of our United States!

Here's a virtual preview of Trump's Presidency #ShitShow https://m.facebook.com/ManureExpo/ 
not easy when the president himself is a bigot.
and vice pres too! Got a goddamn triumvirate of malice
it's time to stop the political mud slinging and get to work. Do the job you were hired to do Ms Warren
, Obama didnt give @realDonaldTrump the oval. He trounced the DNC machine and won fair and square.
I truly hope that you and the rest of the Senate and Congress fight this before his inauguration .please !
the Breitbart friends in the White House is disturbing
Hillary has over 1 million popular votes. The White House is the people's house all of us.  #draintheswamp
when will you figure out the people just want you to be quiet?
So true
keep on fighting- we need you now more than ever
