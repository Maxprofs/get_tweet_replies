Dumbing down society. Not right! Tobbaco held accountable finally.
That word goes with what your doing Ms. Warren. You are bullying the President Elect instead of working.
You bully your own campaign contributors. That is a fact. You put it in print. Ranting and raving as usual.

@cbsboston Hey maybe you can call a war party of fellow tribe elders and perform a ceremonial dance...
@cbsboston Anti-Business Lying Warren. Are you Native American???

for the record … we wouldn’t have a Trump presidency had the Dem party “allowed” you to run. We need to end this 2 party system.
This voter stands behind the @MassAGO   #climatechange @SenWarren @exxonmobil @MassAGO @cbsboston
A WY voter gets 3.68 times the voting power of a MA voter. Overturn WTA laws. Equal Weight Eqal Dignity.
Oh hell  is the judge in on the Trump fiasco too
You stand in shit.

we must fight for every inch as football players. Never fumble!
TX court needs to listen to the wise words of Hank Hill: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKBGHhc1E5o …
@cbsboston the only bully is you Poco, do something good for the USA instead of nagging all the time
@cbsboston we are going to be counting on you to stand up for all disagreeing with
Trump. #Putinspuppet
Why is "politically motivated" a defense for anything? Shouldn't be able to just cancel because you think so
Wow - tx for passing along.
@cbsboston Senator, can we please stop the crap, like this, that makes you look foolish?  You are important.
Dem party can stand together you all are to busy cheating each other then backing the one that cheated
@cbsboston No we don't.
clarify?!
We don't all "stand with Maura Healey" esp given her gun grab over reach in MA!
Even Mika is tired of your old hippie routine, fake Indian.

@SenWarren @exxonmobil @MassAGO
linage is part of race. Are u a racist?
Don't mess with Massachusetts.
