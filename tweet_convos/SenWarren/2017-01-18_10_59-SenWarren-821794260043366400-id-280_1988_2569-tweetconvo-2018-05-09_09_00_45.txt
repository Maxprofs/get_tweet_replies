reality sucks
@SenWarren @FoodAprecianado @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury
Well, shit. We know that. It's January 18. World ends on Friday.
Become well armed.
@FoodAprecianado @SenWarren @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury
actually studying for my gun test. Figure I'll take a few jackboots with me.
What? I thought Liberals were against guns......
@FoodAprecianado @noplasticshower @SenWarren
you can't assume anything about ppl you don't know.
Okay....now please spread that about Conservatives....
@noplasticshower @SenWarren
I do actually.
did you say foreclosure is this individual the one that lost his house and you purchase it for pennies
I've researched flipping, homes are Not sold for pennies. Not market value, that's a given. Bank wants as much $$ they can
when I mean pennies I mean cheap
Hook me up! Foreclosures Seattle are not cheap by any means. Husband & I want to flip but simply can't. $$$$

Republicans are trying to punish Democrats because they hated Obama.
Reason #546: Why the GOP is evil!   LOL!
@SenWarren @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury
@DianeToucan @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury 1 Republican Senator overrules 25 Democratic Senators. That's life in the swamp.
#2018 baby.
lol. I won't say it's the "new normal" because I don't accept that.
#2018 is a huge election. We need to get to work!
we are in Trumpland. Not one Dem tried to stop this inaug w all the evidence http://www.mcclatchydc.com 
Surprised but not. Old enough 2 remember when some Republicans used to have integrity. No more.
I remember when you could respect some politicians too. When being called a dirty politician was bad
People we respected are toadying 2 Trump out of fear, or to get favors. Party over country. Sad.
not to mention what the people we don't respect are doing! 
shame on Hatch. #sameasiteverwas
@PalmerReport @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury Call 'em out. We will vote again!!!
@Deemoney521 @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasuryI have just read that Republicans voted no hr7 where women will pay more for health care
@GammaRae206 @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury The GOP love their "little people." Keep getting their votes, or at least enough of them.
Protect us Sen. Warren. We need you!
You are one of the few senators we can trust to look out for the interests of average Americans. @SenOrrinHatch doesn't care.
Shameful! Where is the transparency! Keeping asking the tough questions @SenWarren
.@SenWarren @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury How about criticizing Charles Schumer for causing the run on the bank that led to its failure?
@DMiller_357 @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury 

Shame on you, Hatch!!! No decency. No transparency!!!
OUTRAGEOUS!!! #resist
because they don't care about citizens. Just their pocket change.
shut up cheekbones
Shame on you Hatch. I will fight to see you ousted!
These hearings are horrendous, disgusting and so partisan. I hate our government right now.
I'm so disappointed right now, all I see is from the @RNC is greed, greed, and more greed! Oh and how to screw the little ones more! #2018
Cuz they r gonna confirm him no matter what
What a surprise!!
@PalmerReport @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury He can't handle the truth! Disgusting They need to be voted out!
Hatch needs to take his old CORRUPT Ass home, I can't stand to hear him talk
I agree! Me either. We need to vote these ppl out
Trump's Mr. MINORITY president, loser of the popular vote, lowest approval 37% ever for POTUS day 1
Yes
Anyone else appreciate the irony in OneWest Bank and foreclosures?
@Ralfoo7 @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury Hold a separate press conference and bring them in!
@ballardista @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury Treasonous Republicans. Hope the Inauguration is a DISASTER! I hear D.C. is ghost town.
keep fighting for us @SenWarren we appreciate you!!
keep fighting! Load up on the arrows
They want more free stuff!!

and supposedly Hatch is a "man of God". Right. 
@TheBaxterBean @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury why pray I ask r @SenWarren @SenMarkey @joekennedy attending cruel #TrumpInauguration ?
@PalmerReport @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury what's he afraid of?
@oufenix @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury senator hatch has been too long at thefair. He's bought & paid for

Pretty sad when @GOP avoids minimum required due diligence. We will remember in next midterms
are we going to have to go underground ? 
my intuition is saying prepare for the dark night of the soul
@TomPriceMD House budget committee chairman blatant incompetent irresponsible response on own finances
just like @TomPriceMD turned bailarina response on Stocks purchases!
I am listening to Mnuchin's hearing. What a HOLLOW & politically motivated tweet by Sen. Warren. Awful
The ONLY way we can watch the whole hearing is C-SPAN  that is a DAMN SHAME that CORPS give them COVER
Upsetting that @MSNBC  @CNN doesn't cover this grifter who refused 2 tell us Trump family Foreign DEBT
Didn't catch name of other Dem senator who just ripped new one for Munchkin. But you & she should make up 2020 ticket! Keep it up
How about Exon,Mobils exploits in Nigeria,the crews all here.Womens March,they've already given reasons for every age group to be protesting
What's another crook?
Shame on you! I'd the shoe was on the other foot you'd be screaming bloody murder. You're a hypocrite
don't go away mad but definitely go away. Your a LIER just like HilLIERy. Your not Native American (Indian) your a fraud.
rude to say "if you know the answer why are you asking me". Mnuchin's has a tick. It's called lying
U should have @SenSchumer testify as to his role in the foreclosures. #hypocricy
Is deception the only thing you learned in Law school? Doesn't say much for Harvard. REFUSED??
-George Soros is one of the eveil men behind OneWest ?Show your transparency.No Dems should take his blood money
What happened 2 ur JOB BEING ABOUT YOUR CONSTITUENTS? #HereThePeopleYOURepresent You should be FIRED @USTreasury
@Comeridethwhale @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury they don't want the truth. Can't face the harm they've caused
please keep fighting Senator Warren - this man is the epitome of the swamp
maga #theatrics
@Montgomery_bjm @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury 
Absolutely Ridiculously Frickin Schocking! NOT!
@SenOrrinHatch #WhyWeNeedTERMLIMITS! #SENILE!!!
@SenOrrinHatch Great job representing best interests of the PEOPLE!! What weasley pile of shit! @CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews
crooks, all!
Phony @SenWarren @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury #Mnuchin the only 1 to step up & buy this disaster bank. Without him it w have been much worse.
How about telling everyone why he refused. You left that out.
@SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury
NO ON MNUCHIN
warren would have done same thing if roles were reversed.
why did they not ask for that back in 2010 or 2011 or 2012? Political phony.
this is SUCH a lie. If you believe Senator Warren, you are simply politically biased. Read up!
Shame on you Senator Hatch. Shame shame shame.
OneWest Bank was not the ONLY bank that affected Americans & stole their homes! #disgraceful
Orrin Hatch....your time is over...you are a terrible senator....please resign.
Hypocrites.  Once the testimony is out there, they have to explain vote to confirm. But we still know.
Why is our GOP not treating these nominations w/ scrutiny they deserve? Party before country-immoral
not surprised.
@JoeMyGod @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury Orrin Hatch is an embarrassment to his position and a truly reprehensible person.
@LogjamminPete why not Hatch
If you are not with ALL American people,  you're against us Orrin Hatch!  Hope you are ready to lose on 2018.
Whattttttt?
@deejay90192 Orrin Hatch,like Sen McConnell has become a multimillionaire while a Senator,he cares less about middle class
Hatch is big on family values, right? I guess stealing homes from people is a new family value.
Thanks for trying but @SenOrrinHatch doesn't give a shit for the average American only there to protect Wall Street.
@supertaschablue @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury Who were those senators? The senators that did not request need to be primaried.
for shame you are supposed to serve all the American people
unbelievable-how corrupt and self serving our government is
I suppose the reason for this is the same as the ACA Midnight Repeal foolery? Because craven, Orrin?
because orrin hatch doesn't care about the US only about his own wallet. If citizens die, #shrugitoff
Did these victims pay their mortgage payments?
shame on you @SenOrrinHatch
old Orrin is another SWAMPY that needs to get flushed. Always protecting and never looking out for USA
@KevinKlawitter @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury Really Orin? Really? What are you being paid for all these years, may I ask?
ugggg wth?
u actually expected hatch to do his job?  We need to send these ancient white guys to the rest home
So!
Let victims speak.Why is Hatch not in jail?Shamefull, heartless,cruel,greedy sorry excuse for a human.
that's crap
time to protest at his house cuz unless it's personal GOP doesn't seem to care
to the victor goes the spoils.  Suck it up buttercup.
Not being able to pay your mortgage doesn't make you a victim!!
Many years ago #OrrinHatch was a respected man. Now, recent years he's neither.
WHAT? He doesn't want anyone that isn't a billionaire. For regular people....I doubt it.
..@SenOrrinHatch <-- Does the Senator have an explanation or has the transfer from public servant to Royalty been completed?
Snark, snark, snarky, snark.
Is that good or bad?
The foxes definitely are guarding the hen house. GOP cowards!
Any Senators not attending the Inauguration, to stand with their colleagues in House?
such a sad day when a senator won't listen to his constituents, you work for the people senator.
@vickscan @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury wouldn't expect any empathy from Hatch.
Shameful.
Ethics are not optional.
@leapgerbils @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury That's inexcusable Senator Hatch.  History will not look kindly on the GOP/Trump era.
Mnuchin is the worst if the worst of rapacious scum. Are we really going to allow him to be rewarded for it?
.....#badjujuSenOrrinHatch
good for Sen Hatch!
. @SenWarren @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury Fascism 101. Fascism has come to America and it is the #GOP !
Such a shame @SenOrrinHatch didn't want to actually listen to the people.  Why should big banks get all the say?
horrible. You say you're for families, maybe just your own
These hearings are bogus. They are changing the rules in the fly.
please keep on them! we are with you
grill them.
THEY ARE ALL TRAITORS
Senator, please boycott the inauguration!
I'm sure, he doesn't want to be associated with any of you lol.  He'll deal on HIS terms, not yours
@gumboqueen3030 @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury He's a POS!!!! Dirty like the rest of them! Don't give up DEMS!!
well I guess  @SenOrrinHatch has chosen his rightful place in history. #UnfitToLead @USTreasury
I dont pay my bills and Im the Victim...only to a liberal
Trump's alligator farm is busy. What happened to draining the swamp?
Good!
We the people are being hoodwinked and rolled over by these wheeler dealers lining their
of course he did. He already knows the facts - just doesn't want to deal with them.
Senator Hatch you need to listen to ALL the citizens of the country YOU CAN'T PICK & CHOOSE
I used to have respect for you Sen Hatch .  No more
Hatch is an embarrassment to UT, cares nothing about people just his party. Sad.
- make any more screaming YouTube videos lately? (Yawn )
why is that Sen Hatch, seems kinda relevant to the kind of person we are vetting to be in the job
Mnunchin is a greedy  and corrupted Jew!
That's really looking out for the people isn't it. Careful Sen Hatch, your trumpism is showing.
@JasonLaCanfora @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury   Mrs. Warren, Kina like u refusing a handshake.  No class!!
Only qualification these nominees seem to have is being rich. 
#NotMyPresident #IllegitimatePresident
he also took the time yesterday during his question period 2 espouse the virtues of ol'Betsy. Then ended w a fluff question 4 her
Don't blame @SenOrrinHatch at all. The melodrama from Democratic Senators alone has already overpowered all reason in the room.
Just keep going.  Don't give up.  You are our voice. 
Is there a gop senator with empathy or a conscience?
@iamthehare @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury | out government does not have ears for the governed and will regret it one day
naturally. what did you expect?
that is wrong just wrong
Keep fighting @SenWarren !!  I'm appalled at GOP pushback on these hearings!
why orrin? Don't u represent the ppl? Oh, I 4got u've been there 2 long u 4got your job! PATHETIC!
Of course he did. They can't afford to buy Orrin so to him, like most prostitutes, they don't exist.
Need openess & honesty in all hearings. Mr. Hatch, don't obstruct democracy. Many unfair  hearings
of course he did
but if the bank needed to meet he would find time
Oririn Hatch is as corrupt as they come! Republican leaders are amoral traitors
Orrin is a partisan hack.
foreclosure bc u cannot pay. So they shd get free ride while others pay? never buy if barely mak'g it.
Must've missed the victims of your client's banks @ any hearing you've been involved in. Or reps of the Cherokees.
a reality check is not part of the swamp gators repertoire
Disgraceful. Shame on the Republicans for rushing this process without enough information on nominees.
I would say this is disappointing, but it's completely expected.
Repugs protecting their own!  American neefs to hear the real story...press conference, maybe?
Keep fighting @SenWarren. We won the election we support you.
@VetsForObama @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury  On what grounds?
These hearings are a SHAM. The GOP has NO INTENTION of blocking these TOTALLY UNQUALIFIED nominees.
Sen Hatch has been in Congress too long. Time for him to be put out to pasture. Ornery old misogynist!
Keep up the good work Senator Warren!   Thank you for being our voice!
This is disgraceful! The American people deserve to know the truth about Mnuchin's record.
You lose, Betty!
meet them in you office, show people you care.
Dirt Bag

 @fxp123 @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury
@ballardista @SenOrrinHatch @USTreasury My God! I want to ask what is happening but I already know the answer. Democracy is dead.
: @SenOrrinHatch, He's just another mud bog in the big swamp. Keep working as hard as you are Sen Warren. We appreciate it!
As a constituent,I'd like to hear more about your real estate profits.Wisconsin right? #Hypocrite
Of course he refused, he's as awful a human being as Trump!! It will be years before we recover...
I can't believe that my state continuously reelects him. He doesn't speak for me, just himself.
were any of them the foreclosure victims that you preyed upon?
At this point  @SenOrrinHatch is stooge. It will bite him in the ass. Keep up the great Senator Warren.
why are there no Senators boycotting  #InaugurationDay ?????? #InaugurationBoycott
If SenHatch refuses to listen to his colleagues, our country will suffer. We are watching/listening.
Wouldn't hear from them cuz, really, they're just ordinary people hurt by the man
I am so glad I am no longer a Republican.  They once had honesty and sought truth. #LyingDonnie
Watching old white men with saggy asses & dentures deny our kids' futures is rich; God is watching too
Has Hatch ever gone without food in his life? Does he know anyone who has had to struggle every day?
unbelievable. He's a puppet!
More reasons for me to be PO'd at our government.
As your constituent I find your REFUSAL TO LISTEN, very disturbing. #DoYourJob or #Resign! #LameDuck  @USTreasury @SenWarren
Huh. Perhaps your party should have tried to win back the Senate.
