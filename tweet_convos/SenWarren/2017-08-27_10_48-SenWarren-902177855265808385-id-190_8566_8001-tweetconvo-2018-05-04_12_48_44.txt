You were suppose to be at dobie high school on south east side 2 days ago!! Where are y'all???? Need food and essentials!! Hurry!!!!!
I hope they treat everyone better in TX than they did in NY during Sandy...the Red Cross failed NY miserably!!!
Red Cross is the WORST! They lie about where their funds go! They blatantly lied to us as fundraisers after 9/11. We quit making their calls
I remember what they DIDN'T do after 9/11 & it was deplorable how much money they collected! And then their failure during & after Sandy!
If I had more than 140 characters, I could tell a horror tale! They would NEVER get 1 penny of MY money!
Places like the Red Cross, Joel Olsteen and HSUS get so many donations and do absolutely zero...people should donate to that mattress guy!
Even the Salvation Army! When THEY come 2 a disaster, fire, flood, whatever...THEY GIVE food, coffee to victims & emergency workers. Not #RC
They blame it on their regional directorsâ€¦ But I think it's rotten to the core!
Please donate to the @RedCross to help victims of #Harveyflood #Harvey
Don't trust Red cross
Just a QUESTION Barb, WHY NOT TRUST RED CROSS?? I have family in Houston and I KNOW THEY NEED THE HELP!!
Money given for Haiti was not all spent in Haiti they kept some back...Haiti still has problems today..
Yes
you want to donate check out @TzuChiUSA these people were amazing during hurricane sandy. Real help plus they hug everyone
hay
I donated $100 to @RedCross - and just requested corporate matching.  Thank you for taking care of the folks impacted by #Harvey.
$60 of that will go to high ups at Red Cross ðŸ–‘ðŸ–‘ 
At least that means $140 is going to folks in need.  Please share what you are doing
Thought you said you donated  $100? By my math, that means $40 from your $100 is all victims will get! That's ok with you?
I donated $100 and requested company matching funds.  My company just announced that they are matching 2:1.  Math was $200 less the $60
I didn't see about your company matching.. however you're OK with someone taking a 6 figure salary & not giving to victims?
Bon courage !
PRESIDENT TRUMP Helps HARVEY victims https://www.disasterassistance.gov/  obama Ignored SANDY victims
I will give to anyone #But #TheRedCross . They collect but the $ goes where?
In their pocket
No you're not!  YOU DID NOTHING AFTER SANDY!  #frauds
Well please don't blame Trump for Sandy failures.  Obama administration is responsible for that one.
Did I blame Trump?
You are great big and wonderful peopleGOD bless you
Mhm
Wonderful how they built 5 houses w $500M Haiti relief and stole Katrina money
Prayers for all in need. I wish I can come and help!!
I tried to donate $1000.o in diapers to my local #RedCross. In Wichita Falls, TX but they wouldn't take them.
Since @meacuppa blocked me cause she doesn't want truth, here it is others & myself have said
I
Salvation Army - More of the money gets spent on our needy.
Last time I checked the SA was that it took 13 cents to be deposited before ONE cent was given to the needy. Too much over head
And what did you find with the Red Cross?
Why so you can keep 80% like RED CROSS always does, just a little bit goes to those who need it the rest you keep
Never give another dime to you.....
Local church opened doors as shelter but they need help w/ food, supplies, organization. Pecan Grove Baptist Church , Richmond
What about the child? What about the victims? What about your soul?
God won't forgive you #MooreThe BaptistPedophile
Thank you @RedCross
@Red Cross & @UnitedWay
We REMEMBER
They partner with Baptist, Salvation Army and hundreds of disaster relief volunteers who all partner to help.
Gracias por compartir la informaciÃ³n! #LasTicasFansClub #Chayanne #ChayanneFan #QueMeHasHecho #Sonymusiccentroamerica #EnergÃ­adelabuena
The Salvation Army does more
Red Cross is the worst charity to give to and to put here. Only 15% makes it to help, and they are wasteful. 6 figure salaries for leaders.
Please donate to THE RedCross nothing is too small #HoustonStrong
http://www.redcross.org/news/press-release/How-the-American-Red-Cross-Spends-Your-Donations â€¦
Red Cross take six figure paychecks, Salvation Army or some other charity.. Red Cross are all about themselves.. look it up
Thank you, Red Cross for your unwavering help for storm victims across the U.S. Now for helping Texas.
Let's hope so
You going to fuck this up like you did Hurricane Sandy?
hey they gave out amazing paper thin blankets to sandy victims.... oh and a broom from 1974
Have your CEO donate her million dollar salary
How can I volunteer?
One should donate to some local Texas relief agency ensuring more of your money goes to help the needy and not administrative echelon.
Us Texans appreciate every help we get
Just donated 40 dollars feel really good
Please respect my vote for my President Trump and my right to support our Americas success
Thinking of you all! @atdaustin is here for @ATDSanAntonio !
You failed in 2005 w/Katrina, 2010 w/Haiti, 2012 w/Sandy & Isaac & in 2015 in Cali

People should find other organizations to donate to
Find another donation source.
I hvn't donated 2 ARC since wht they did 2 Haiti. Won't until they rectify Haiti AND become 100% transparent abt hw funds raised r applied.

Please change your policy to allow pets at your emergency shelters
There are shelters that allow pets in Houston.

Homeland Security warns of cyber scams appearing to be Harvey relief requests http://hill.cm/PziKjO3  
Your phone's do not work, and held on phone over half hour. Cannot donate by phone or iPad. I need help to help
Dios bendiga tan hermosa labor.  bendiga y extienda su Mano Misericordiosa a cada persona afectada #RedCross #Chayanne #FamiliaUvitaPresente

@lalalouda
THANK YOU
Isn't Haiti still waiting for your help?
Thanks everyone I live hear and its crazy and my nease was one of the survivors bc there house was flooded to there chest and she is only 4
Go to Texas  #RedCross â™¡â™¡â™¡â™¡ people need help after Harvey
God bless you for charities.
Jesus tells what makes us unworthy for rapture.
Hampton Inn at 10505 East Freeway, Houston 77029 has taken in evacuees who flooded Deiday night, but have run out of provisions. Please help
Glad to hear. Evacuating a really big place like Houston is almost impossible.
Your churches have to rebuild and clean up also. They aren't going anywhere. It will be a long time before the effects are resolved.
In the 99 tornado and the other last big tornado the Baptist churches in Moore and Del City were wonderful. It will be along period.  OKC
Don't donate to RED CROSS!! Those $ going straight to the C.E.Os pocket.  No lie..Nola still hasn't been been helped.
Congrats on writing a great tweet! http://nonprofittweets.measuredvoice.com/RedCross/status/901863997074485249 â€¦ (Ranked 4th for Aug 27.)
Thank you for your emergency response - we sent our donation
Congrats on writing a great tweet! http://nonprofittweets.measuredvoice.com/RedCross/status/901863997074485249 â€¦ (Ranked 3rd for Aug 27.)
They never even paid the drivers who brought loads there
Fema is full of shit what about katernia they fucked everyone on that deal they lie so much
Praying for Houston 
If you are a victim, remember, Trump says Mexico will eventually pay for the wall, and David Clarke's new book is somewhat readable.
Shelters were understaffed and not well equipped!
GUYS DONT BOTHER CALLING THEY DONT EVEN ANSWER
I am not seeing this on TV. Can you do this? 
I am concerned about elderly sitting in or near water not knowing what to do.
@uscoastguard 6314 laver love dr spring Texas 77379. Ask anyone. But a boat would be needed. My friend's dad is stuck upstairs. Emergency!
@RedCross 6314 laver love dr spring Texas 77379 Ask anyone.But a boat would be needed. My friend's dad is stuck upstairs. Emergency!
Call KTRK channel 13 or DPS for evacuation 911 only for health emergency!
Thank you, Eric!! I have family there and it is just horrible!
The #RedCross is #HopeInAction. Most of us can't help in #Houston, but they can. Help them to help others!
No. I'll choose a different option.
Will the money donated for #HurricaneHarvey go to the victims!?? Or to 6 figure salaries? Luxury hotels? #RedCross
 
@gentebonitaperu
the Red Cross has run into trouble for spending much less on disaster recovery than they collect,

I would like to donate but live in Canada. Can you post the donation number for Canadians?
Thank you
Use form on their website for specific donation for #Harvey. Any other method goes to greatest need!
Kudos to you, Chayanne, for keeping us informed of the Red Cross & its humanitarian efforts.  I work with those who are in crisis. Thanks!!

How can we volunteer at shelters once water begins to recede, roads clear. We are blessed where we are and already made monetary donation.
.@RedCross is a bureaucratic scam. Donate elsewhere so those who need it can actually get the help they need
Folks I just donated money. It was a tweet by @BarackObama that got me on board to donate $$. 

Please donate! Pls Retweet!  Namaste!

Barb, you obviously know nothing about the #Red Cross
Im on the North side of Houston in the Klein/Tomball area ... if I can be of any assistance in the relief efforts, please let me know
@SamaritansPurse is looking for volunteers
Scammers

Additional phone numbers in Houston
How would they call you if they've lost everything? Where is the army?
Hopefully they can get to a phone? Good question, Dump is busy tweeting crap .
Actually the national guard is there sweaty

Why'd you put this here ?
So reassuring
Might want to think twice though. Read this:
You should think twice before donating to the Red Cross. Consider alternatives. https://www.propublica.org/article/the-red-cross-secret-disaster â€¦
RC received millions 2help Haiti Haitians never received any of that money! the CEO received a huge bonus that year
Scroll down the bottom..
Takes about 5 mins 
How much will you be charging those people for shelter and food? #personalexperience Ya'll would be better off going to the @SalvationArmyUS
Unless you're, uh, not down w Evangelical Christianity
Website: "Salvation Army Exists to Spread the Glory of God"
Ppl need HELP, no strings
When your house burns down one winter night do you want to pay for #RedCross coffee when the #SalvationArmy gives it away for free?
@PolitiBunny Remember folks the Red Cross hates POTUS and Conservatives

I'm praying for u all #Harvey
Stay safe Texas. Thank you @RedCross. We THE NORTH @Canada  have you in our hearts.
Not all funds go to help #Harvey 25% off the top to Red Cross
Consider it a tip.
Save your meals tornado season coming
A tropical storm send ICE check for illegal aliens
Yes please spread this message to everyone in need!!
Gofundme mama needs help
If you text the word HARVEY to 90999 you will make a $10 donation to the Red Cross to help those affected by #HurricaineHarvey
Red Cross collects 10s of millions for Haiti & builts SIX houses - their new number for TX is 1 800-SCAM
Why won't my tweets show up on your home site?
Hope Red Cross changes their mind &supports @realDonaldTrump & his supporters who all love helping Americans & will help victims of Harvey
This isn't a political thing. If we're being political the president hasn't done anything
Some physically &financially help Harvey victims -Others can show we're united Americans w/ POTUS @realDonaldTrump by showing care & prayers
Stay Safe Houston & surrounding area. #Harvey 9-1-1

God Bless the Red Cross. They always come through for those in need after disasters regardless of race, sex, beliefs etc. Heros all.  
Thank you Red Cross. Thank you @Cameron_Gray
Your local chapters in Fl dropped the ball Im FEMA certified PEMT RN.No lines manned for volunteers.And ive worked 12 plus hurricanes.
Who are rescuing the animals?
Samaritan's Purse works fast.
Please use ALL the money donated for rescue efforts and sheltering people affected. Not for anything else.
What about all that haiti cash?
That Haiti money has to stay in Haiti, any money that was given during a specific disaster and it's declared for that disaster has to stay
Why don't we step back and let Mexico bail out the White Republican racist morons or the National Transgender Guards. Got Boat ?
Oh really, I would hate for it to be you that was in that situation, you might be singing a different tune
