How's that swamp drainin' thing workin' fer ya?
This wouldn't have happened if the Democratic Party would've given Bernie a fair chance.
it sure wasn't predicted by your media with all of the Democratic collusion!
I'm still waiting for his big "change". Unless change was even more corruption.
you should see how overjoyed they are at foxnews... but not one mention of emails anymore no wikileaks
They will come when needed
@Neecha04544 @GOP @CFPB Consumer Financial Protection Bureau must continue to stand and pretect mid class families #Trumpprotest
Sorry don't listen to you. You put party over principle when you supported & campaigned for Hillary.
Nevermind that Wall Street futures were high per the prediction that their pal & puppet Hillary was expected to win.
Yep, it's why I honestly think that a lot of what Trump will do is the same as what Hillary would.
I'm with Senator Warren and I'm in the Resistance!!!
Good plan

Elections have consequences. Crooked media
Wall Street didn't get their candidate. She got 23 mil from them.
I feel disappointment, fearful, and helpless what should we do...??

Didn't Wall Street financially back @HillaryClinton? Sour grapes!

the Wall St banks are friends to the Dems as proven with all the $$$ they give to you and @HillaryClinton
@SenWarren If you would have endorsed Bernie and stood up to @TheDemocrats corruption, this could have all been avoided.
#yourfault #ownit
Anyone wanting to remove or reduce the CFPB is admitting that they want to screw over the people and get away with it.
@Lee_in_Iowa @GOP @CFPB ok. Duh,what is cfpb? Thanks!
Travesty!
So tired of idiots saying "he can't be bought" he's one of the buyers U just handed the key to the henhouse to the fox
THANK YOU SENATOR WARREN! YOU ARE TRULY A BEST FRIEND OF THE WORKING CLASS. IM WITH HER!
AND DODD FRANK/tax reductions for corps and 10-% ers  DUMP THE "DUMPSTER" trump
It's like we're sheep, kicking around the pen after shearing  - then, sometime later, we get sheared again . . .
You're seriously calling out the GOP when you supported HRC for President. Better check her campaign donation reports!
@Lee_in_Iowa @GOP @CFPB can you please not cower to this maniac?!? Please stand up FOR US!
So you could care less for 400k 400k to mr. Trump is like $10
Because of his tax cuts and everything will do his business
Why do you think Trump said he won't even take the four hundred thousand a year salary to be president
Nothing you can do about it. It's sad. Get used to it. The poor getting poorer and the rich richer
Sounds like #GOP has not learned anything from #deregulation & the #financial #crisis it caused in 2008-2009.
I can't wait until you're out of that seat
I guess you haven't read Wikileaks's yet have you? Either that or you are just lying. Of course that comes easy 4 you
and this connection needs to keep being made that Rs are bad for working/middle class. 8 yrs of blocking Obama=mess

Using an unsubstantiated claim of Native American heritage to further yourself means you are a racist!!!
don't let them. @GOP only cares about top 1% and donors.
yes!  So freakin smart of them!! Worthless govt. agency-
Prediction; Trump debt so huge with more war, tax cuts & spending the inflation will boost his real estate values YUGE @SenWarren @GOP @CFPB
what that should tell you when Wall Street is happy. Middle class and under are screwed again
Trump is going to set us back 50 years in EVERYTHING!
@talktojhill @GOP @CFPB hey John.. cfpb is a lawless entity that needs more than an undercut.
more liberals should've won then. The country has spoken, they don't want liberals in charge.
"2008?  What happened in 2008?  Sounds familiar ... Anyway, let's eliminate all banking regulations!"
how much are these banks invested in trump? How much debt dies he owe them?
Stay strong Senator Warren. We need you to fight for what's right!
GOP criminals in action like vultures
Save us.

K. Yup. We came u a dollar short and a day late.
And they will. Not sure we can fight them. Nazi America now.
so her loud screechy voice bothers nobody?
Cry me a river...
@WellsFargo will be THRILLED with @realDonaldTrump and his @GOP goons who will deregulate this country to death.
the only ones who are going to end up happy in 4 years are the ones who get deregulated and can rip off people easier
please run in 2020
pick up where killer Clinton left off :selling favors & starting wars! No more #HillarysWars
Are you for real?? Clearly you don't live in the USA or are completely ignorant
Yep. Nothing says "taking care of middle class America" like making it easier for banks to rip you off. True colors!
"Let loose the Dog of War.!"
Dog of War finally leashed on 11/8 - killer Clinton dogged Iraq,Libya,Gaza,etc! no more #HillarysWars

I work in the real estate industry & I know for a fact many lenders were hoping for a Trump win for this very reason.
yeah another crash.....I'm sure we can take it. We recovered fully right.
So stop them.
Start a new Party w/ Sanders, Reich... Red and Blue is dead. Can't get money out of Dems or Rep. Public want new.
is that what you & @georgesoros discussed today?  Why don't you tell him to call off the riots?
bussing people around to riot contributes to global warming
