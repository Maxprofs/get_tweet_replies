They just wanted to see what a lying LOOSERS looks like!
Such a diverse crowd.
Are none of these people aware how big of a snake this woman is? Figuratively of course. Kinda like that "I'm native" thing she tried.
Dang, Sen Warren I see you not scared like the GOP are of crowds
That because there's nobody shooting at Progressives...
So would JFK. How far back do you want to go?
This is what it looks like when senators actually have town halls. In search of Rob Portman.....I know he's got to be around here somewhere!
No ! Martha's vineyard is a hangout for the very rich. 
VERY RICH !
The year rounders here want their voices heard, sir. Not "VERY RICH." You're thinking of tourists and summer residents that don't vote here.
She's there fund raising , plain and simple. The rich are there now. It's all about $$$!
Then why did Trump start  the day after his election & sign up for funds.... Have you heard what's good for the goose is good for the gander
Did I criticize campaign fund raising? Warren raising money is common and has nothing to do with TRUMP.
Just 1300?  And, how many are middle and lower class? 
WOW YOU HAVE NO LIKES!! YOUR DONE ##### GO KID ROCK!!!!
Try that in Texas.

https://youtu.be/m31FE1OVzWw  Sure Does!
Senator Warren, fake Champion of POC. She held a town meeting without one POC attending. Typical hypocritical action by Sen. Warren.
We need those same crowds attending in Ohio, central PA, mountains of WV &the sands of AZ. We need 2 expand. Blue stays blue. Flip the red.
Democracy looks like a bunch of rich ppl hanging out together?
Good time to be a Dem isn't it Senator Warren? Pretty ironic. They have complete power and we have soaring momentum and support. #PERSIST
And no funding because you protestors are too busy calling in to have money to contribute. While @GOP is raising more than ever. #MAGA
Hahahahaha....she said they have "soaring momentum & support" hahaha hahaha!
Looks like I have some of the WH Fake News bots following me.  

Just sign our Bill.
Lmao looks more like you enjoy the #Fakenews
Hey Chris, really came through with that (skinny repeal bill) last night, another big failure for Trump, or "WAIT" that must be Fake News?
I'm so glad you didn't avoid the masses.  You may be the saving grace for our democracy.
This may be the most ironic tweet ever. New slogan for Martha's Vineyard: "Where The Masses Go".
Not even a token minority.
Exactly. You hold a talk for Democrats,  and the Republicans didn't riot and disrupt. Great example.
#politicalgeniusthemomenthillarylost
You rock Senator, these people just want to to know that!
Big deal Trump gets 10000 plus!
That's racist against Mexicans "Holy Guacamole" #xenophobe
That's about 1250 more people that attended a @timkaine rally.
Oh don't be stupid. So not attractive.
Thank you for holding one!
Bunch of elitist Pushing socialism from their beach houses.  Doesn't do anything to turn the country blue.
GOP=RED, communist Russia led by KGB communist dictator=RED.  hmmm, starting to see the pattern now?  GOP=RED=PUTIN=RED=TRUMP=RED= TRAITOR
Yes, nothing screams "main street America" like Martha's Vineyard in the summer!
Staged Photographs 
and you were awesome!
I remain impressed!
Thank you for coming to the Island!!!
A lot of racist white people there.   All paid too$. Soros money
Any Republicans there? Antifa? Native Americans?
Americans need to vote for garbage like you in order to taste reality just like Venezuelans are tasting now.
Congratulations Pocahontas, that's bigger than any Hillary rally.

How many people have you got fooled.
Had it been a Trump Rally it would have been held outside. The building you were in would not accommodate the thousands that go for TRUMP.

Democrats want to hold town halls & hear from their constituents, Republicans are afraid to face their constituents.

I didn't mention Russia. Said Republicans don't want to face their constituents. You're using the wrong talking point here.
I wouldn't want to do a town hall ambushed by a bunch of paid activist actors either
Guacamole. So elitist.
Really? You mean that?
All millionaires making a fortune in the current bull market. All closet TRUMP SUPPORTERS !
Anthony has a problem with strong women. 
No Problem with strong woman. Just liars like Warren.
Where's her lie?
If course you know how she earned the title "Pocahontas" don't you ?
Liberals know nothing about people they vote for,usually not even their names. They've been trained like Pavlov's dogs. Click the D, get fed
You're confusing the Cons who are saying, doing, tweeting, posting and spewing the same garbage over and over like good Russian bots.
You are the one who is unaware that Warren lied about being a minority in order to steal a position and money from real minorities...
Wish #northcarolina had representation like you
Amen! Missing the Michigan senators we moved away from
I bet that felt great! Thank you Sen. Warren!
1300 people ! Wow ! Now multiply that by 20 and it could be a TRUMP rally .
Please be our president one day.
Id give u a loaded gun to shoot me,if that ever happened.Thank God and country IT NEVER WILL !!!
As a white woman I don't think you should be appropriating the term "guacamole," thanks.
Wow the left micro aggression disease is worse than I thought.
It was sarcasm dude.
You never know these days
A quick scan of my twitter would've given you a clue 
to me this looks like a crowd of bespectacled white people with a median age of 55
You would be wrong. That group is 95% Native American.
Fantastic!  Real concerned Americans! And NO NEED To question Crowd Size! Brava Elizabeth!!
Bully!!!  Lmfao
Thanks for your service Sir.  My father & uncle proudly served multiple tours in WW2. A Ft Knox lone bugler played Taps at the services
Much respect for you and them as well.
But @SenWarren wouldn't be good for our military.
Respectfully disagree. I fear Pres Trump could create HUGE military engagement (NK?) And we've had TOO many lost sons & daughters to date.
Clinton had plans drawn up to BOMB NK,but JIMMY FRIGGIN CARTER negotiated with NK,so he didn't. NK broke the deal AS ALWAYS!!
As my profile says, I'll discuss with civility. You leap
out of the gate hyper and going back to J Carter on North Korea. Hope u r right--
Yeah ok lizzy
Lol, Lizzy the lezzy.
Party of the Peopleâ„¢ in action right here. Just talkin' to some regular folks.
You should have seen what democracy looked like on Election Day 2016.  Oh, that's right, you did.
Stop appropriating Mexican culture, Pocahontas.
Wow, look at the diversity 
POCOLOCO you are a liar
The fake Injun speaks.
Where's the other 1000 people?
Warren looks at home amongst the people of her tribe....next a traditional meal of finger foods and chai tea.
yea Lizzy..right there in middle America!!
@foxnews @cnn @BreitbartNews So now Libahontas is making a claim on guacamole because she is now  0.01% Mexican after eating at a taco bell!
Okaaay pochahantis!!!!!
This looks like a white privilege convention to me.
1,300 Rich people who have no idea what it's like to live on middle income budget. Coupons, sales, clearance and almost expired meat. #FCKYU
Where are the Blacks?
We were there to protest you Pocahontas
Elizabeth Warren clearly trying to enhance tourism to the island. What a shameful waste of taxpayer dollars.
Real cross section of America there
There were multiple hues of Nantucket Red worn. Truly diverse crowd.
Did #Republican voters attempt to interrupt your #townhall like #Democrats do to your @GOP colleagues? Probably #Not
There ARE no republicans on M.V.!
No conservatives on @marthasvineyard ? Count me out.
Guacamole? That's cultural appropriation right there! How dare you?!?
You had a town hall at Martha's Vineyard? I'm sure that was a very economically diverse group...
Guacamole? #culturalappropriation
You  probably  are promising  free stuff.
Elizabeth PLEASE PLEASE Run for President in 2020 You are the Voice if the Democratic Party #Resist #obstruct #Oppression #Fraud #Corrupt 
Yes elizabeth run. You wont get my vote. Your a Hillary knock off.
U r a disgrace
nothing says "blue collar everyday america" like a bunch of old rich white folks on posh massachusetts vacation islands
What does holy guacamole mean in Native American
Im offended you are culturally appropriating guacamole. You need to apologize
Isn't Holy guacamole racist?
How many refugees in MV?
Your base is so old it's going to die before you do.
Goes to the whitest part of America to hang out with a bunch of rich people & says this is what "democracy looks like".
Did not let any repubs in
"Holy guacamole"?? Now she's Mexican???!!!! 
Wow Liz taking a page of fund raising out of Clinton hand book , how about trying the south Bronx and see how far your bullshit goes !
You're a joke. Ha ha!  Did you do some hologram majic like Hillary did?
All bussed in thanks to soros for picking up the tab
Had a bunch of elitist liberal sycophants come out to listen to you're drivel. That's what the liberals are all about these days,themselves.
#Culturalappropriation much?  Guacamole?  Seriously?
The working Middle Class is shrinking and living in poverty.While Wall Street gets richer.It's about time we take a stand

.
The Fauxcahontas squaw speaks with forked tongue! Every time she escapes the reservation we have to go get her! Saddle up boys and ride!
Not the first Black Brown or Yellow person in those groups.Typical Double Standards. All very wealthy.And for sure no Indians!
MA Yacht Taxes too much for even John Kerry.

You pack of frauds!
Isn't "holy guacamole" cultural appropriation, fauxcahontas?
Is it? Interesting considering we are a representative republic.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @cnn WOW Liz! We had 4,000 REAL people at a recent concert. Don't misrepresent your relevancy!
Imagine Trump saying "Holy Guacamole". The liberals would jump all over him.
"holy guacamole"??? By Libtard standards, this is racist bullsh*t and you should be turned into a deep-fried burrito.
LOL or Fried Navajo Pita bread
big squaw circle scare braves! limping bull must go to happy bar for 3 or 4 fire waters to stomach raging bull shit
U good injun,,,oops!!  lol
This is all I see!!!!!
Perfect LOL
Heres were to donate @va_shiva
'guacamole'? now you're mexican?
1300 rather small but large for democrats a collapsed hate group with a horrible legacy to overcome
Apparently you are unaware that Martha's Vineyard is a SMALL island with limited access. 1300 is amazing!
Wow you compared a crowd of blathering idiots to guacamole?  Very racist and disrespectful towards latinos
Imagine 1300-plus refugees resettled on MV!!! Now that's what real #democracy looks like. Not this gaggle of the rich white folks
I'm glad I wasn't there kook


Senator Warren took an axe. Gave the Bankers 40 whacks. When the Bankers still stole from the poor, Senator Warren gave them 40 more!!!
Why not show the pics of you with the big banker Robert Wolf at the Vineyard? Hypocrite!
How many of those people did you have to ferry from all over the state
If Trump would have been there; they would have needed triple the space toaccomodate the people
How was the wine and brie at the reception afterwards?
Fake Native American appropriates Mexican culture with tweet about town hall with rich white people
The Democratic party is the party of inclusion.
I believe you misspelled pandering.
Martha's Vineyard Looks like a bunch of white Rich folks You all just don't get it
Don't forget self depraved and guilt ridden.
Now that you've used the word guacamole are you claiming Hispanic heritage? :)
weird, all I see are white people. thought they were evil?
I see zero minorites did u keep them all out of your rally? Also 1300?  Lmfao thats a middle school gym 
Thank God we dont live in a Democracy, Correctly our form of government is a Constitutionally Representative Republic  #MAGA #TermLimits
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Very diverse LOL. Could it have been any whiter and more elitist?
The GOP ain't listening
A benefit for what @SenWarren considers to be the needy people!
Wow, 1300. Trump had 15,000-20,000 and more at his rally's!    What a joke Warren!!!
"Holy Guacamole?" Isn't that being a bit racist Liz?
EW got molested by a Cigar Store Indian
Is Marthas Vineyard taking in their fair share of migrants? I doubt it.
Do they even have Section 8 housing??
They are starting to get S8H and the people of the vineyard are mad..They hire these illegals forgetting they need to live close to work..
How many Indians were there? ...... not counting you?
was Injun Buck Colin Kapernick there??
Bernie Sanders does that everywhere he goes, not just the richest places like Martha's Vinyard!
Point is Bernie isn't a Sen for Maine
Bernie is a Socialist you Communist #maga
Did you remember them that you'll do anything to win, including lie about your fake native American heritage? #fraud
Weak, very weak. Don't you want to get a fake news in there? "I Love It".
This is without meaning.
So many racist white men in attendance.
Were any of the from your tribe?
OMG, was I actually "following" you?! Yikes. Someone pls, hot irons in my eyes!  Ugh
Martha's Vineyard.
All the smug rich you could afford to assemble?  Pity.....
Democracy?  I thought it was a picture of Birkenstock privilege.
That's a lot of stupid people!!
Lol
Please run for president in 2020....
Another hateful democrat
Visit the rich. When are u in Chelsea or Everett or mattapan. How about helping us poor people in MA and stop worrying about other states
Is "Holy Guacamole" a religious term, or old Indian saying? Or is @SenWarren now doing  culture appropriations of South American tribes?
Democracy looks alot more like old rich white ladies than i thought it would..
Democracy is to allow for different views, real debate & coming to agreement with the opposition. Having 1300 yesmen & brown-nosers isn't.
Looks like a mob of the grey-haired lesbian librarians you see on Family Guy episodes.

No, this is what liberal elitism looks like. 'Socialism for thee but not for me.'
"Guacamole"? Why are you culturally appropriating words for a room full of 99.2% elitist, very rich white people? Marx & Lenin are proud!
Tell the Indians how you stole their scholarship.

1300!! Really, 1300!! Wow! Add another 10,000 and you'll catch up to our  POTUS.
Didn't know they were allowing indians on the island now.
No, Lizzie, this is what fraud looks like, but as a constitutional conservative I sincerely hope you win the Democratic nomination. 4 more
Drop in bucket compared to our POTUS! Plus your people most likely were paid.  I also hear you won't be winning again. How lovely for MA!

Martha's  Vinyard  represent " America" sweetie.
I get it but a bunch of rich white ppl? Bernie Sanders the only one besides trump that came to Alabama. Poor ppl that deal with the world
Guess it must have been raining..
We are a republic, not a democracy. Was this your "pow-wow"?
Well I did see one person of color.
I call cultural appropriation on the use of guacamole.
Where did they find the room to park all the limos?
You're in the wrong country, this is a REPRESENTATIVE REPUBLIC. .you obviously didn't take a history course that taught actual history, huh?
Thanks for all you do
Yeah your big among the liberal elites. But you don't give a squat about the working stiff in Springfield
Too bad the US is a Republic, not a Democracy.
Everyone was there 'cept Mary Jo.
I see rich white people ripe for the financial fleecing.
Maybe these 1300 people will send an extra check to the IRS for redistribution.  I'll wait to hear this news.

How many were there to support yoir crazy ass and how many to watch the xlown show?
Out of touch with reality in every sense of the word! #Faucahontas #Elitist #Fraud
The peanut gallery and their comments... SMH...
Woohoo Way to go .
Wow! Palm Beach next? #LimoLiberals
A room full of old, rich, white people is democracy now?
Awesome!!
you're in Martha's Vineyard,think about it,so in touch with the needy you depend on to stay in power with promises of hand outs
Love the diversity there.  Nice to see the Dems are really bringing their message to the poor people who need help.
Holy Guacamole???
^ Holy Moley
Holy Cheese & Crackers
Holy Frijoles
Holy Mother of God

All regional sayings - probably more I'm unaware of or forgetting.
I live in Massachusetts. Holy Guacamole not something many of us say.  Wicked or Go Sawx! But not Holy Guacamole.
No, this is what a bunch a rich people look like.
Part Indian, part Mexican I assume too? 
Was there any GOP violent protesters and interruptors?  I didnt think so.
Isn't Guacamole Mexican?? Should you be more into Succotash? Martha's Vineyard, nice. Sure you used your own $$$$ on that trip.
Liz,  democracy? What were you giving away, the farm? Trip to Disney World? An HRC get out of jail free card?
#democracy is the tool of the #marxist elite used to enforce a tyranny of the majority. That is why America was conceived as a republic.
Awful lot of honkies up in the Vineyard
you are a racist
Were are not a Democracy it's a Representative Republic.
Looks like a bunch of rich, white folks to me.

#fauxcahontas
I'm sure the average farmer or steel worker could afford to vacation in Martha's Vineyard. You're a fraud & cater to the wealthy.

Must have been a free giveaway of some sort.
congratulations!
Not psycho at all.... #peopleofElizabethWarrentownhall
The people who live or get to summer in Martha's Vineyard don't represent the views of 99% of the country. I thought you represented the 1%?
