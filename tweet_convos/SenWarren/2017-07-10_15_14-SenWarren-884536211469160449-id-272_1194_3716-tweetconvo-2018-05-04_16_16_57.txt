Republicans hate poor people.
Do not let them usurp the will of the people any longer, hold #Trump to his promises! HealthCare is a right.
No they love rapping poor people and keeping them down
Did I miss something 8 yrs of dems in the White House and the # of poor in this country increased but hey if they say they are helping they
And that's the most horrible thing you can ever say. Do you want to help poor people are call them us and them? And Bush caused this mess
Honey bush did cause any mess. We had a recession it happens. But if ur interested on who created the housing bubble it was bill Clinton.
It was law that allowed the big banks to make the sub prime loans they shouldn't have with the promise to bail them out when they went belly
Up which they did. All under the guezz of u guessed it helping poor people.
You mean when Bust was President?
OH PS #TrumpTrain just rolled back the Dodd Frank consumer protections to keep that from happening again.
Keep fighting Elizabeth, we need ypu
You are such a putts lis....you need to work for the people, not yourself or get out of politics

I voted NO to keep My Tax $$ Flowing towards Your Paycheck & Pension madam #Pocahontas
& still she got in
Congratulations! You win the prize! Youâ€™re the best liar on Capitol Hill not by outright lying but for totally distorting the truth.
Senator Warren this is getting old. Do something constructive instead of opposing everything POTUS does. Dems are a bunch of cry babies.
Dredd, stay in FL. Massachusetts is pleased with Senator Warren. Opposing a traitor in the WH is duty of all patriotic citizens.
Thank you Joann. I will. I couldn't live in a state represented by her. By the way. I'm enjoying my 18% gains my IRA has had since Trump.
Hey Lizzy ala obummer,  we WON!!!
Cabinet hostile to the agencies they lead, will make sure new regulations are in corp interest. Rao free to focus on @CFPB
How much do you lie in the Senate Liz. Liars are scumbags. Here is an example.
"Senate Democrats are putting [Trump's] nominations through time-consuming parliamentary procedures not seen by the previous admin 0-4 2018
Thats because they are a party of bigots
Pocahontas is on the warpath.
You & ALL Democrats & Independents should #VoteNo on all Trump nominees & Trump/Republican agenda!

I'm a Canadian but If I Could... I would vote NO for Neomi Rao for OIRA!! Im a Canadian angry & frustrated w/Trump!!!
Thank you Senator Warren. You are SO much appreciated by tens of millions of Americans, but we're held hostage by Republicans and Trump.
We're being set free by our great #POTUS !!! #MAGA Senator Warren is a #HACK !!!
#imaginethat #dosomerealwork #lyingliz #obstructionist #politicalhack #peoplewilldie
Business, health, tax cuts important but I can't trust this administration anymore. This should be top-priorty What can we do?

Books. Go to http://FEC.gov . All data there.
Still waiting for an answer as to why we can't have the same healthcare as you Senator?
You always hit the nail on the head. Great job!
Liz, have you ever voted YES? Other than how it benefitted the left! Has there been any bipartisan votes to support the US?
News Flash!!! Big business is where many people have jobs. Less bull---t rules and more jobs is good!
Just admit it you are nothing but an obstructionists.
Submit to the DNA test pocahontis
You vote no on everything Trump tries to do Pocahontas

@realDonaldTrump we Americans hate all your Looney liberals laws that help everyone to get more free stuff on backs of taxpayers
Stop putting everyone to sleep with your tired, sorry dribble.
Alabama, you don't need to listen. You don't understand much anyway, do you?
Not about dishonest, disingenuous liberal propaganda dribble - no. We tend to stick to reality.
Go Lizzy!!! You should just keep fighting everything DJT does, even if it is good for the country.
You really love this Country? You would rather hate than see good people of nation helped.
Obstructionist
Always comes back to your cfpb.  1800 hires in 7 years. Avg salary near 150k for a gov agency. The jig is up

You are a goddess among women, who never never never stops fighting for us!
You're a lying hypocrite.
Lier lier pants on 
Indian giver
Yea making unelected officials (richard cordray) accountable to elected officials (the president / congress) is bad! grrr big banks!
Atleast there was a vote
Thank you Senator Warren.
I'm confused, I read a NY Times article, she seems quite qualified. Besides, cripple business, cripple the counties ability to compete int'l
That is not why you voted against he Pocahontas, you voted against her to obstruct the administration...you did with all of the other votes.
If Pocahontas says it, it must be true. Not!
You bet if she fights against it, you better fight for it!
Shocker! Obstructionist! No re election Lizbeth.
She will be re-elected. Count on it.
Go Democracy!
What do you have against big business?  We have too much regulations now. Trump is doing the right thing, join him.
yeah they don't need regulation follow Trump because he had done absolutely nothing to create jobs.He is an idiot

You vote no for everything goofy Elizabeth.  Don't worry...you don't have to actually do anything to get tenure.
Lizzy warren took your tax, gave her cronies many stax, when she saw what she had done... haha I don't know I know she's crazy though.
@SenWarren , you voted no bcuz instead of looking at facts u just went by ur hate for President Trump, u should be fired!!
Another rat added to the swamp

YAWN!
So glad we have Sen Warren looking out for us. Thank you for your integrity and service.
So what you vote no on everything you're goofy too bad your voters don't vote no on you you're a waste of taxpayers money
So what else is new?
Well, I'm glad to see the democrats are doing something. Not approving Trumps nominations is nothing more than a ploy to handicap presidency
Thank you Senator.
Thank You Senator Warren, much appreciated.
#politicalembarassmentfr ommassachusetts
Big surprise Pocahontas what are you for again? Oh ya obstruction. Great job and you'll leave a great legacy.#maga#termlimits
Thank you for your persistence. Bipartisanship makes American great. Conversations with the senior senator from AZ great example for country
Jesus, Mary & Joseph!! Will is ever end????
Thank you Senator Warren
That's cause you are the party of NO!  Doesn't matter though, you lost!!
Thank you for fighting for us.
Of course you did. No on everyone to slow down the process. Dems first then Americans last


You don't have any credibility

This is what thoughtful, logical lawmakers look like.  Thank you Ma'am, please continue.....
Logical?
You would vote no for any Trump Nominee Pocahontas... your a loud mouth fake joke
What were the rules that were suspended

And HOW!
Thanks for your tireless fight to preserve the sanctity of our democracy. I'd hate to see where we would be if you weren't in the Senate.
Alot further along! More accomplished, when you have all partys working together,not against bc of ones elected party, not the real issues
