I'm telling you, if Wells Fargo was unionized, those employees wouldn't have had to misbehave to keep their job
According to your logic, you should also resign your current position and pay back Harvard. #Fauxcahontas @SenWarren @CFPB @WellsFargo
BINGO!  A Zillion UpTwinkles!
sounds like congress and the clintons. Integrity at the top will set the example
deplorable.
plenty of public "servants" have done the same. Where's the accountability for THEM, you hypocrite?
Hillarious tweet by asswipe @SenWarren confirming EXACTLY what I said
 The @CFPB merely COVERS for banks
A fig leaf
Does NOT prosecute them
when will you be this tough about hillarys emails and the clinton foundation pay for play>?
You were awesome in calling him to account for his self serving fraud; how can we lock them up? Make them pay?$
The same way you lock up Clinton for her abuse of power, taking bribes etc. Oh, wait not so fast
Not so fast bc of smthng clld due process; Totalitarian regimes lock up w out evidence, trials
liz  if u cannot abstain from rash judgements, u should b barred from taking part in interrogaton.
This scam has been going on for several years.  Open your eyes.  Started in North East when rescued Wacovia
Get back to us after the two IRS employees who erased Lerner's emails have been fired. @SenWarren @CFPB @WellsFargo
The selective outrage is noted. 
@SenWarren @CFPB @WellsFargo
how about the head of the IRS or the VA?
Here we see idiotic @SenWarren tweeting HERSELF that the @CFPB is a totally toothless fraud- DOES not, CAN not, WILL not help!
clean up the IRS and show them how its done.
and???? @CFPB @WellsFargo
is he related to Drumpf.... of course in scamming the people, govt and IRS
Who in the federal government got fired over ObamaCare?
sorta like claiming to be "Cherokee" in order to get preferential status at Harvard? #Fauxcahontas.
Sounds like Obama's IRS.  Hillary probably gave them the idea as she's stealing from her poorest doners.
But you defend the discrimination by the IRS?
.@SenWarren @CFPB 
Some (we're looking at you @WellsFargo) consider this a feature, not a bug.
Ask, "how has this affected stock price?"
Is this worse than the VA scandal which your president does nothing about?
Well if anybody should know about fraud it's you. HOW!
But have any been promoted & given bonuses? Oh wait...I'm thinking of the federal government.
Dems recruiting Hillary replacement?
why would they think they should have to pay when Hillary doesn't have to pay for her crimes
Shouldnt resign or be fired. Should follow the O-admin and just be moved to another office in the company.
So who has Obama fired at the IRS, VA, etc.  Be an example before you throw stones.

GOP senators are so outraged by Wells Fargo’s fraud they want to eliminate the agency that uncovered it .#VoteBlue  http://www.vox.com/2016/9/20/12989688/wells-fargo-cfpb …
if a Teller took $20.00 from the drawer would they get fired? Step up to the plate, Some execs should be Fired!
My friend/WF emp complained about the mo. sales quota forced to meet even with drive thur customers.
OMG This has been ongoing since before 2000. My friend & WF's employee opened several accounts under my name
Why would he. It was probably his idea. As long as bankers collect millions for stealing our money why not?
But nobody believes you folks will do anything about it. (And Mr. Fargo, nobody believes that tweet above.)
What crimes can the senior execs be charged with? Fraud culture. They need some jail time
Criminal activity, the top need to go to jail, do not pass go, do not collect $200,000,000!! Go Sen. Warren!!!!
either have u or everyone in congress!#Maga #PJNET #WakeUpAmerica #Democrats #TermLimits #TCOT #WellsFargo
Saw you telling him to resign. Great work. Thanks for telling him what we want to.
Thank you for being our champion to go after these dirty rotten SLIMES!!
ha ha ...you need to just shut up....you lied about being Indian to get free or reduced education..just shut up
jail time!!
Why should he fire someone else? (Haha, where's t rump when you need 'im?) @SenWarren @CFPB @WellsFargo
Sadly this type of sales fraud is part of corporate culture, not limited to banks, experienced it daily
Deplorable!

Oh yeah, so is this...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiWs6Tk2RUM&t=1585 …

AND this...
Heard you good questioning today!
So the DNA is forthcoming then? Ironic that a dishonest ass such as yourself would question the ethics of anyone.
I guess they're operating under the premise that anything is OK as long as you blubber on TV and accept Jesus.
Yes we see the sham put on display of Trump(Clintons controlled opposition-purposeful boogey man) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybPM6I5rCaE …
What about Buffett, Clintons #2 Oligarch supporter who is the largest shareholder in Wells Fargo can't he do anything?
Hmm, sounds like the federal government doesn't it Lizzy?
he seemed insulated from it all. Apparently powerful enough to influence the board, but couldn't answer direct ??'s. Paradoxical
This tweet is hilarious. Pocahontas HERSELF admits that the @CFPB is a toothless entity- a fig leaf for crook banks!
CEO is obviously a thief.In @realDonaldTrump words "Lock him up"!
John S & WF top Executives should be fired and not given any $$$$!  In fact they should return their salary.
you rocked his world, Senator Warren!  Well done.
@realDonaldTrump  Lizzy question Hillary who dropped youWe  get an indictment and you can visit her in Prison.
BIG DEAL!! No one took care of the officials at the CFPB that were part of their whistleblowing scandal 
Semi God. Wait for derivative lawsuits by shareholders
Why would he call out other executives, the culture theft is ingrained in them

I've worked for places like WF who pressure sales staff to meet quotas. Choices- meet the quota or get fired.
What VA?  Why do only hold responsible non govt entities?
When Pocahontas herself tweets that the @CFPB is a lapdog, you know I've been right all along.
 Read her own tweet!
Look, Pocahontas herself tweeting how her own @CFPB has zero teeth!
Just like I've been saying all along!
CFPB = SCAM
could The Senate maybe question the people that charge the cashiers with theft but refuse to charge the banking execs? ;)
cough**VA**cough http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/3/va-still-plagued-by-problems-two-years-after-scand/ …
U Demorats @SenWarren need to do the same to #IRS & VA Chiefs that U suggested for @WellsFargo CEO! #Hypocrite
That is because he approves and has no fear. Bet he is a Republican
.@SenWarren @CFPB @WellsFargo When does this flagrant corruption end? Pass laws that put them in prison. I would be sent to jail 4 taking 1$
It works for the IRS, the VA, and your job.  Or did you think we forgot your faking your heritage? #youfailed
how tragic that you're pushing a candidate that will gut @CFPB & never hold @WellsFargo accountable. #JillNoHill #NeverHillary
TY Sen. Warren for grilling these crooks. Normal Americans would have been jailed for less. #wellsfargoScandal
Has anyone been fired over the IRS scandal?
The @CFPB is being outed as a total scam. A fig leaf to protect banks that donate to @SenWarren by giving appearance of action.
@SenateBanking @WellsFargo Ask him if the rumors are true that Hillary campaign is charging poor seniors credit cards multiple x
Thank you for standing up for the masses Senator! Mr. Stumpf was on CNBC today - he's too crooked to jail
If Stumpf new about and didn't stop it he should be arrested as an accomplice along with all the perpetrators.
look at the scam you ran for years.
Just curious, did the incentive structure for front line staff change at all?
Fuck that. Criminal charges or it's not enough.
Need to make them pay,help the families they hurt, ruined.Why do rich men #Trump & Co's always get away w/it ?
.., Nw guys.., I'm #HillaryClinton will wag her finger at them which should fix everything.
@Cam_Fine @CFPB @WellsFargo CFPB misses a massive scam for years? How many of those execs are you going to fire?
#stumpfforjail
@AnaliFirst @CFPB @WellsFargo Senator, I heard your remarks today. Thank you for calling him out. Only a coward does what he did.
You calling Obama and Clinton cowards? It's their playbook to lie, cheat & steal
Taking a play out of the Obama and Clinton playbooks.
What? Odd pic in ur bio. 84% of NY Jews are liberal. Whatever
I did watch the hearing for a few minutes.  You were really on the war path... shooting arrows... Scary!
Loretta Lynch needs to indict this SOB
I'm closing any Wells accounts I have.  He is a lying cheat!
Your verbal takedown of him was spot on. If he was a teller & took a handful of $20 bills...he WOULD be fired!
- thx Senator- accountability starts at the top, 4 far too long exes have found scapegoats or push the blame.
So right it's the Corp atmosphere-. When employee quotas R impossibly high w/o lying-cheating every1 loses.
This CEO sounds like VA Sec. Robert McDonald.  He hasn't fired any wrongdoers either.  Go figure?
yet another example of a "SIN & A SHAME" if @realDonaldTrump is elected this#crapwillbethenorm
I lost my house and all my money to .@WellsFargo. Still billing me for stuff 4 years later.
I want to fully understand your experience, Kate.  Please share some more details (no account numbers). ^NR
. @SenWarren @bobbiekingsbury @CFPB @WellsFargo well said #Pocohantas
KEEP ROCKIN DON'T GIVE UP YOUR CHAIR
Wells Fargo chump change fine.  Nothing will change. "I am mad as hell and I am not going to take it anymore."
all hot air fake outrage Wells Fargo BIG demoncrat donor you'll condemn,complain then it will disappear
Why did all those employees just get fired and not go to jail? I don't get it.
@yiawda @CFPB @WellsFargo Ugh.
No, but they did fire 5,300 low level employees. Accountability this is not.
Good job @SenWarren Rip into that SOB. Firing, fines and federal charges please And no f'n severance
and he won't over 500 were fired for following orders when all u have to worry about is a fine who cares ?
and he still has the staff working under the program goals until January 2017
#DiningWithSwine. i kept wondering why i was getting notices about an account i allegedly had....
How hard is it to require banking institutions to report closing and opening accounts on Credit reports ?
Let's talk IRS or VA resignations Lizzy #hypocrite @SenWarren @CFPB @WellsFargo
you show remorse for advancement after lying about being an indian? Or getting 350k to teach 1 class?
If u have an account at this bank & you care about cont'd bank fraud, move your account.Only way they listen.
Bravo Sen Warren!!!  I can't convey how much I enjoyed your "questioning" of WF's CEO Stumpf.
and you should see what they're doing w the repo @ the auction major scam
even if they were fired they'd probably get a $20 mil + severance package...
No, but they sure fired all the lower level people that were directed to carry it out, didn't they?
This is the very worst example of the elites failing to hold themselves accountable. Stockholders suffer too.
A criminal investigation should be started
why isn't there a criminal investigation underway?
thank you. Encouraging to hear the right questions asked at last. Good work.
well, @SenWarren was actually in a Senate Banking Committee hearing grilling the CEO of @WellsFargo
http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/20/494738797/you-should-resign-watch-sen-elizabeth-warren-grill-wells-fargo-ceo-john-stumpf …
Where is @PreetBharara when you need him?
This is what happens when capable women dont run for POTUS office
I worked for them unethical behavior is accepted and rewarded company culture, top to bottom.
Wait for him to start talking about "culture change" and how long that will take....

what's up Indian chief?!
what's up deplorable?
