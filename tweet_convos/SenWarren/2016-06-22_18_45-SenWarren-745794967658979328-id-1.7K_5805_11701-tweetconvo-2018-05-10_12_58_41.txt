Oh sure @SenWarren, but where were these Dems when Bernie & workers #FightFor15, $ out of politics, single payer?
$15 an hour? Hey ignorant person, who the hell is going to pay for that? Please never vote!!!!!
Never vote? More of a reason to vote against your neo-con bullshit.
I pay my workers $18/hr.
typical liberal liar. I'm sure you pay everything you should and don't break any laws! LLPOF!!!
How is it a lie? Oh that's right. Neo-Cons don't need proof, because you said so.
it has been proven it will hurt millions and millions! Are you that uninformed? You want to hurt the elder Americans?
Proven where? Show me.
Let me guess. You're gonna tell me to "Google it yourself," cuz you can't come up with the proof to back up your bullshit.
the dept of labor put the fiduciary rule in to protect Americans. The GOP is protecting Wall Street!
How bout protecting time tested truths like DEFEND YOURSELF!! Govt can't save you 99% time
Do you drive on roads?Bridges?Drink Water?Call 911? Yeah, they never do anything for us.
@SenWarren@HouseGOP What do they do for your personal safety? You think 911 is your best chance at safety? #LiberalLies
so if ur having a heart attack how is ur gun going to help you?
why is the 2nd amendment the Right to Bear Arms? In case tyranny strikes and govt forgets to follow the 1st amendment!liberal
that was when we all had muskets. How will your guns fight off drone attacks! Atomic bombs? Tanks? Antiquated rhetoric, bruh. 
PPL #Liberals don't want to battle Ideas/concepts/plans/Visions. All you have is a negative view on Humans/freedom/prosperity
@mr_thurman @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP Wish we saw bipartisan effort from both sides on both issues. Lots of room for improvement.
Eh, they have enough seats to not need CoOp in takedowns of successful legislation…yet nothing on recurrent gun violence.
1-sided legislation is rarely optimal, regardless of party. DOL fiduciary rule will be harmful to low income savers. 1/2
Just don't see how any of it relates. If Rs were remotely interested in doing anything re: gun violence, they've the means.
Both sides have issues they dig in on & refuse to compromise. I'm sick of it. Best case, no one totally happy with final result.
But there's a difference in repeated neglect of public safety and bickering about fiduciary rules (that benefit consumers).
No doubt issues have different levels of impact/severity. I'd love to see all laws require a minimum % of votes from both sides.
I'd rather just see more sides...two-party system is largely antithetical to short-term progress.
you should be ashamed for behaving like a whiny child with a sit in and supporting @HillaryClinton like Benghazi never happened.
"People are watching" as in "Child, stop throwing a tantrum and get up off the floor, people are watching"
Dems = corruption
Yes Lizzie, people ARE watching. Hillary is the most corrupt person to EVER run for POTUS!
I hope senator Warren has some of her own @wikileaks time.
YEAH! WE R WATCHING U FEED UP W UR PC LIES&MANIPULATIONS WON'T FALL 4 IT! C UR @HillaryClinton BULLDOG NOW
when the Dems had Congressional control you were as bad and as inefficient as the GOP! Shameful!
please tell Hillary to not get in the gutter with trump. Does it take a GOP getting shot for them to act?
Has your DNA results came back yet???? 
Don't you have a tribe meeting to go to or something ?
I love seeing you gun-toting idiots tremble in unnecessary fear. "They's taking our guns, Cleetus! Let's call 'em names!"
Why do you hate yourself and your rights so much?
It's more than just about me. That's the problem I see with all of you thinking these bills will take your guns. They won't.
care to comment on how this isn't trying to take the guns? http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/white-house-assault-weapons-ban-224493 …
It's really sad.
Is NBC fake news too?
I really do hope this is real, given the circumstances. I own a gun & believe there's no need for weapons like this.
You should go join them ..without your phone.
Yes, people are watching, & tired of you putting American lives @ risk.
I know, I am from Massachusetts, she is a liar, and ineffective, but the liberal morons voted her in. Next election.
At least they aren't pretending to be Native American to land a plush job like you did. We're watching!
We're watching
YOU should be ashamed of yourself Pocahontas! Disgusting
GOP is for the rich. They have killed the American Dream. VOTE THEM OUT in November.
All politicians are bought by the rich. This is why our Country is no longer great.
We do not have much to choose from for President. We need to vote out Congress and Senate for change.
Our Country cannot take another 4 years of the do nothing Congress. VOTE THE GOP OUT.
DEMS you better stick together this time and fight for the American people.
Congress and Senate politicians need to be FIRED. VOTE THEM OUT in November.
Presidents have no power. The do nothing Congress needs to be voted out to save America.
Congress refuses to pass one bill. The do nothing Congress.  VOTE THEM OUT In November.
at what point does my voice and the voice of my representatives count more than the NRA and Wall Street!?
when they are defending your right to due process under the 5th amendment. Innocent til proven guilty.
@scarlett671 @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP Are they voting on HJ res 88?

@LibertyUSA1776 @SenWarren
Republicans better suit up for a down-ballot battle. Start by getting some heart.
yeah, we are and you people sitting on the floor look pretty juvenile.

.@SenWarren So that explains why @SpeakerRyan turned off the @HouseGOP cameras! #TurnOnTheCameras because I want to watch. #NoBillNoBreak
@MSNBC is using Periscope feeds & is broadcasting live.
The world us watching a bunch of spoiled children throwing a peaceful, loving temper tantrum.
Senator Warren should give up all your armed security&secret service, or are politicians more important
You are a National Embarrassment Lizzy
@ThePerezHilton @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP I'm ready to vote
yea and democrats are no better. Wow you are a complete biased wack job lady
By cutting off access to @cspan press you violate the 1st amendment. #NoBillNoBreak
Remember when Pelosi did the same thing? No?
That was absolutely wrong as well.
So ready to give your own civil libertys away to government hacks. Who are well protected with GUNS!
wow, seems a bit uncalled for.
Ha! The proverbial pot calling the kettle black...
you should be ashamed.It would be nice if you did this for something that had actual merit. Not just a hollow gesture
: You should be ashamed that most of the @HouseDemocrats are comprised of race-baiting thieves.
Look who's calling the kettle black!!
is a Clinton (Wall Street ) prostitute.  pretends to have principles and then sells out to highest bidder
You people are shameful. You sit-in for rights, not to deny them.This is not a college campus, try to #crybully #ISIS.
#NoBillNoBreak #NoFlyNoBuy #Periscope @periscopetv #GameofThrones

Warren you should check your facts before you send smoke signals
.@SenWarren Gun control is for crime prevention and shouldn't be tied to anti-terrorism bills that can violate any citizen's civil liberties
The GOP operates as a solid wall re Right to Choose and LGBT rights, but Dems splinter on our goals, so no changes.
@drhappyknuckles @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP This could lose many down ballot races 4 the Republicans. The people see who is fighting!
my grandpa said we are Indian too so I am;can I get free college?
bill is weak attempt on gun control &allows white radicals access 2 ak47s due 2 racial profiling of terror list. #GoBigorGoHome
Stop whining.
None of you have credibility anymore so stop this nonsense at the cost of the rest of us.
Shame on the GOP!

"Pocahontas impersonator" where are your feathers ?? you should be ashamed to go out in public without them !!
@SenWarren @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP

listen chief, we all like the 5th Amendment and would like to keep it
you can't aways just blame the GOP. You could have at least passed the GOP's Grassley Bill....
Hillary & Bill Clinton are war criminals,a vote for Hillary is a vote for her adulterous husband
Sorry Elizabeth
We r not with you
You r with HRC/Wall St now
Pls look at your priorities
#stillsanders
