Why change now? You never stood up for the Constitution before. As #potus44 said, move to the back of the bus. @MariaBartiromo

@docrocktex26 Say NO to everyone and everything. Republicans r incapable of working with u. Don't work with them until they learn
well, if the gop really cared about our democracy, they would stand up. But they care only about party and power and money! SAD!
no ma'am. It's time for you to do your job and stop wasting taxpayers time and money
300 retweets almost 800 likes do you see my point?
you could try that all you want anti american liberal, but Sessions will be next AG…now you and fellow lying libs can go home
@Sonny762x39 @SenWarren watching then obstruct and drag their feet is just pissing me off.
that's ok , it will get done.
it will with or without them
You were equally outraged over the GOP dragging their feet around Merrick Garland, yeah?
that's completely different. Obama was at the very end, not the beginning
good argument!
please request Senator Toomey to Recuse on DeVos he has taken well over 50,000.00 from her.  He can not sell this vote
Thank you Sen. Warren for standing up for us. Any Democrat who votes "YES" will be primaried.
A Batshit clone of Nancy Pelosi . . . you are ALL crazy freaking loons .
there are no bounds to the left's hysteria
It's time for everyone to see @SenWarren as the get nothing done obstructionist & divisive politician she is. Sen. Sessions defeated the kkk
@GlennF all democrats should oppose all nominees. Why you voted to move Carson out of committee baffles me
No on Sessions, no on Gorsuch, obstruct this insane President and the corrupted Republican party.
you and your cronies are not for the Constitution. You will always be in the flavor of the day
NO ON ANYTHING WHAT DRAGGED A REPTILE IN
@MariaBartiromo Senator, as a resident of MA, you don't represent me at all. Please learn about the constitution. #Ignorant
we need to be saved from Trump. Please help us. We a need a hero in a White House full of heartless power hungry GOP.
@RickKrefft @SenWarren
@SooperStreet 
Jeff Sessions is a GREAT choice. You, Pocahontas, are an embarrassment to the nation!
yes, he is a great choice for racists. Which you have just admitted to being. #sad. What are you scared of?
PooperStreet.  Do me a favor and delete me from your list!
Not quick on the uptake friend. U did this, not me. I'm enjoying my opportunity to enlighten you. Don't be #scared no #racism
last 8 years no defending  constitution  while obama trampled it, no one listens go a lunatic pocahontas
and vote for term limits to get rid of deplorable lawmakers like @SenWarren
you people there gonna keep on till you get voted out of your office..
@MariaBartiromo #Fauxcahontas Please run her for POTUS in 2020. The meltdown will be epic! She's a #Clown
I used to respect the Senate. It was run by true public servants. Now, sadly, there are fewer like you. You're great. The rest. .
@MariaBartiromo everyday I'm more convinced the drug use of the late 60s did more than kill brain cells and common sense
i doubt you’ve even read or understand the constitution.
@MariaBartiromo @SheriffClarke @IngrahamAngle If we stand for the constitution you and you socialist colleagues will be 1st to go
We need to see your "NO" vote as well.
please post that letter that from Mrs.King that got you silenced
@HalSparks this is for you @robportman
You @SenateDems need to have a little sit-down with @JoeManchinWV.
His stance in support of Sessions is simple unacceptable.
: 
AGREE! @JoeManchinWV, you are WRONG! @jeffsessions is a RACIST & unfit to be AG!
it's time to stand up and give the nominees an up or down vote, not run away like rats or cockroaches
WE WILL NOT FORGET YOUR YES VOTES ON ALL THE NOMINEES.IT IS TIME YOU STAND AND ACT AT SAME TIME.
Stop your grandstanding.  Do something positive for our state instead.   Not a good Senator!
i used to support some of your issues.. but youve jumped off the cliff. Your making many people dislike you. Move foward.
She backs Ben Carson's bullshit, then says this??  Yeah...not sure I believe her anymore.
can we vote no on your crap? Oh wait we did!!! You lost  Pocahontas
Thank you!!
@peprulz I vote review process & let the ousting begin! My #liberal w/ #conservative sprinkles values = party! #humanitarians
your just mad you got caught breaking the law
@MariaBartiromo please do the justice
keep up the good work. What is best way for Brits like me to help?
Republicans are spineless and in Trump's  pocket so don't  count on them.
Democrats are criminals. You and all the rest. Spineless? That was Obama. Get your facts straight.
I tell you Trumpets are just too too much.
at least we have respect for others. How many violent riots did you see out of us the last 8 years? Libtards tantrums
lying  hypocrite
That is not a substantive political argument.
Check out  Tweet:
Okay, then...  
VOTE NO to POCAHONTAS & FAKETEARS SCHUMER #TrumpTrain #MAGA #BuildTheWall
@MariaBartiromo hahahahaahahahahahahaha the Constitution hahahaha yeah OK
you didn't stand up for either the past 8 years did you? I think not #Pocahontas
we will not we have our own mind
Delete your account
thank you
Please keep fighting for us, Senator Warren!!! The American people need you!!
AMERICANS won! Not Mexicans, Syrians, Iranians or any1 but AMERICANS!! But AMERICANS won! GET OVER IT!
when do you plan to accomplish something, please stop wasting taxpayer money!!!
Where was this Idea 2,4,6,8,10 ... years ago ... I thought 
Protecting the Constitution is for Sovereign citizens. #lefttheleft
Interesting that this is the thing you want proper to stand up for the Constitution.  Maybe you should read it again.
@SenSanders please urge Senate to vote down Devos my son needs the special help and she is scaring me as a parent
u should look into what she stands for! Instead of just listening to talking heads
seriously! We, the people, are BEGGING YOU! This confirmation CANNOT happen. His allegiance is to Trump, NOT the Constitution.
Sadly I think they all know this. They are trying to decide what's best for their jobs. Look at Sally Yates.
the legislature and judiciary are really our last hopes to stoping this madman. They HAVE to do what's right.
You mean the same CONSTITUTION you, the Dems. and Obama ALL ignored ???? That Constitution ????
you believe in illegals for a vote. Get over yourself. Our President campaign goals are here. You Dems condemn, Trump delivers
I bet he gets confirmed 
Her " tribe Symbol is ( doller'a Signs)
Please Sen Warren stand against this administration's rush to establish a dangerous world view. We demand our Dems fight for USA!
why vote for USA now? Where were they the last eight years? Oh I know destroying and dividing the USA themselves!
thank you! Action!
Umm Nick?? Your hats to small
Keep in mind We All Supporters of @POTUS will Vote NO to You when You try 2 Run again for anything ever again How does that feel?
Shame they dont see what their doing, God is ending the Evilness in World Time for whats Good 2 Come back Strong
lol another way to look at it!
Straight white male GOP senators defending Sessions: 

"How could he be prejudiced when he's always been super sweet to ME?"
HAHAHA, I love you.
That's the real danger of Senate nominees: they had 20+ years to banter with their colleagues in the gym. Even @LindseyGrahamSC can't see it
@MarcosBreton unfortunately Elizabeth, nothing you can do about it. All of  his picks will be confirmed, one way or another
Democrats can go home... We got this..lol
the American people are standing up & #resistingtrump everyday. Lawmakers Please,It's your turn to stand up to #TRUMP & resist!
"I feel blessed & honored to have partnered w Senator Sessions in being the senate sponsors in this important award" @CoryBooker
Stand up for the #Constitution, the American Constitution that is and vote #YES! 
-The American People
yes! Thank you for voicing your conscious and our collective concerns.
sessions is a decent man, you democrats are just so hateful,america is ashamed of you all
Good luck with that plan, as I'm not sure alot of those jokers ever read the Constitution. Maybe you could read it to them?
@MariaBartiromo I hope that crazy lady enjoys her last term abusing the senate officeNo true American will vote for this disgrace
Sorry Senator. @GOP has no moral compass. Go guerilla on them!
@MariaBartiromo Senator UR an obstructionist! You'll regret it in 2018 when Democrats lose Senate seats. I'm sick of ur attitude!
Thank you Sen. Warren! Gloves off, don't let up! #resist
@MariaBartiromo The DEMS don't realize that if they are digging a big hole for themselves. They look weak and childish.
democrats and morals don't even go in the same sentence
and we all know Trump has morals. Morals of a racist,sexist, homophobe. No place in 2017 for morals like that
is it weird to be brainwashed?
I dunno,let me see ur shiny brain and I'll tell you.
@MariaBartiromo it's time for your party to grow some balls and fight the enemy out to destroy our country. It's called ISIS.
after 8 years you finally learned we have a constitution. Where were you when Obama was being over ruled by SCOTUS multiple times
It's way past time for the Senate to stand up for the Const. Thanks for continuing to remind them, useless tho it seems to be.
@MariaBartiromo. That hurts coming from a fraud & lier. It's going to happen so just accept that your a loser. 
some Prozac could do you some good for the next 4 years.
@MariaBartiromo and the people will fire you.
How about no more hearings until Constitutional norms are reinstated!
Thanks for trying.
Stand up and vote "No" like Ben Carson? What a joke! Democrats are history if she is leading. Step aside for Bernie and Keith Ellison.
Get on board or get out of the way. #SoreLoser #EnoughIsEnough #ConfirmSessions
your holding us all back....resign..
@MariaBartiromo Actually , it's time to vote you out of office! Especially when your own state doesn't even like you!
@MariaBartiromo kinda like the moral leadership Pocahontas exhibited in lying about her Native American heritage
GOP senators, time 2 cross the aisle.
NO on Sessions.
@SenJohnMcCain
@LindseyGrahamSC
@senrobportman
@marcorubio
@SenSasse
A line must be drawn.
Trump is out of control.
Help Save USA
@DITUPAC3361 So do all the Senate constituents because WE WILL PRIMARY YOU.
before you call the kettle black on moral issues do we need to recall your law license issues in Massachusetts #Sessionshearing
You're a hypocrite, a disgusting woman who pretends to be #NativeAmerican & is shifty on YOUR taxes. The #DEMS are done 
#PartyOfNo
Not about u ppl! Mad at loss, fine, no right 2 ruin country. bridge gap, ur making ppl hate 4gain Didn't vote 4 DT, so save hate!
Apparently not one of you can stop anything. Just hand them the country and be done with it.
Are you still pretending to be a Native?
Time for you to retire and let someone competent to take your position, stop being an angry woman.....
disgusted that #BetsyDeVos nomination has been passed to the senate 
YOU need to grow up
ya used the "m" word, they've forgotten I think. They should lose the title "honorable" #maga2020
Ms. Mann, you should take a break from the real world
@RepDennyHeck 
@PattyMurray 
@SenatorCantwell 
Thank you!
What is your EXACT reasoning Ms. Warren or are you just being divisive as usual?
I JUST URGE YOUR COLLEGUES TO VOTE!
... The unraveling of our Constitution is my biggest concern. They are cruel & greedy men that DT has assembled.
thank you.
thank you for staying strong and fighting the fight that needs to be fought!
You need Republicans.  Otherwise we just look like a bunch of whiners with fake tears
Why would she vote yes? She's a lie'n lib
Agreed
@TheDemocrats @ @GOP grow a pair seriously, don't destroy America's core beliefs
they were destroyed by Holder and Lynch. Enough said!
@beaglezrock bwahahaha
they lost because they cheated @BernieSanders . And no lies being told about Sessions.
@Eykis And don't even consider Scotus. Remember the voters will decide next election.
really!? You think your fellow GOP will do that!? They don't have enough backbone.stop dreaming; start acting.
@USRealityCheck YES on Jeff Sessions for AG!! Don't you just get it??? We won! You lose!! And keep crying 
Term limits Pocahontas ... Term limits !!! Lol
@HaitiJustice no to them all. Give fascism no quarter.
thank you for having integrity & morals in the midst of your greedy self-serving colleagues. Stand strong for us-we need you!
Iu
GROW UP for God's sake
Is it possible for Democrats to boycott the hearings & deny a quorum? Won't Rep use nuclear option?
you need to do your job and what is right for ALL Americans.    Confirm Sessions.
vote No on Pocahontas...
please! We need you to fight!
@LexuxM wrong!
@fozzybrn Where was your NO vote last week and the week before? You seem to be opportunistic.
you lied about being a Native American, shut up about morals.
it's time for you to retire
until Trump acts like a President hold everything up!!!
GOP has no morals anymore
LET EM KNOW
isnt it time for the Democrats to finally have the backs of the American people?  How many more marches do you guys need? #StepUp
nice start! How bout the rest of the cabinet? Or are y'all just gonna roll over for fascism bc "high road"?
no for sessions
Wait... Are we supposed to repeat what you say?
@MariaBartiromo I think it is time to retire and go collect speaking fees
as usual, NOBODY except your simpleton groupies are even listening to you Poco-Haunt-Us
So grateful for your strength, intelligence, morals & leadership! #History will remember those who stood up 4 law & constitution
like when she never fought for #NoDAPL  until it had been stopped already? #Progressivesstandup
and begin impeachment proceedings. Nownownownow! Please!
dems are going down faster than a trailer park hooker
VOTE NO ON JEFF SESSIONS FOR AG
NO on Sessions, NO on Gorsuch, as a constituent you have my vote and can count on it if you make a 2020 POTUS run too.
@MrsAdrienneBosh Senator as a public school parent please show the same effort against Devos
It is time for the Senate to "exert moral leadership" but they have to get rid of You and your BFF Schumer first
Agreed
thinking they care more about their own political skin than doing what's best for the country. When trump fails, so will they
Vote YES for Sessions!!
@PattyMurray @SenatorCantwell 98002 says no to Jeff Sessions too racist then too racist now!
agree, but Sessions is not enough.
- like you voted no for Carson?
good luck with that
primary any Dem who votes for Devos, Session, minuchin, Price, Tillerson, etc.
It is time for the Dems to start caring about this Great Country! Go Away,,Trouble Maker!
Funny you don't look like American Indian. Maybe an India muslim though.
Thank you Senator!! #resist
do NOT even allow them to have a quorum. It doesn't appear we have enough votes to stop him so for the sake of US #boycott!!!
@MariaBartiromo try adding ethics and integrity to your wish list
@MariaBartiromo Elizebeth Warren is a very sorry excuse for a sent. not fit for a dog catcher
Hold your ground Senator. We are with you!
