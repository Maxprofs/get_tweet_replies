I asked Betsy DeVos why 2 of her key aides are fmr for-profit college execs with massive conflicts of interest.
The same day I wrote to DeVos about her aides’ obvious conflicts, one of them apparently resigned.
The damage has already been done. @usedgov announced it would let student loan companies charge some struggling students outrageous fees.
The DeVos aide who resigned last week? His dad happened to run the student loan company that sued @usedgov about that pro-borrower policy.
Transparency, pressure & activism work. But we’re going to need a whole lot more of it to make @usedgov work for students.
we the people need our voices heard and the appropriate actions taken. The majority do not support Trump.
your wrong.  the majority of legal citizens do.
the majority of legal citizens did not vote for Trump or his agenda
Strange that he had the popular vote til Cal numbers with the sanctuary cities came in.  hmmm
not even close ignorant troll
Stay on her!  Thank you for being a great watchdog for the rest of us.  You're the best!
Is this what a senator does? Troll cabinet members on twitter ?
Somebody needs to be doing this. trump has turned government ethics into a joke.  #conflictsofinterest
It seems a little unprofessional.
because what DeVos did was professional? Hiring people with #conflictsofinterest?
Being unprofessional is not alright because someone else was unprofessional. In fact it's... well... unprofessional.
I didn't agree that Warren was unprofessional. This administration needs to be investigated. So scary.
No? 
Send a critical tweet about your coworkers and see what results!
DeVos is not an elected official. She is an appointee that bought her position and admits it. #conflicts
@rolandsmartin stay on it Senator!!!
I don't think too many want to be a part of trump administration anymore. Keep it up! 
they got what they wanted more money for hire
we just have to keep an eye on all of them
well they didn't fit... you can't have morals!
@mahamosa 
Write more letters!!!!

That's nice and you're still NEVER going to be POTUS. 
@18DianneM  she needs to be out too
Who? What,
Betsy DeVos 
His appts. Wont go til 2020
Unless some criminal charges
Tillerson might be weakest link.
what about a corrupted election?  We've never had this  before.  None of them would be in there without collusion
Even after 2018 if We have 
Senate House takes 2 impeach
Unless proof on Pence 
Some ppl did this 
All pay
Now if only we could get her to resign... #BoughtAndPaidFor
Clarification - get DeVos to Resign, not Warren. #resist
Purely coincidence. You are the laughing stock of the Senate right now. Go back to the reservation.
nevertheless, she persisted! Keep fighting for us @SenWarren! We all need you!
With so many conflicts and scandals to choose from to confront, it's a shame this one will fade into the background most likely.
they all r part of Putins take over, their days r numbered but we need 2 stop his efforts 2 continue 2 destroy the US

So when do you finally get around to the senator stuff like, originating a bill or two? We don't pay you to run for POTUS.
had NOTHING to do with you, Poco. Stop patting your own back.
@MAHAMOSA @business this is legal? Really?
thank you! You're my SHERO!!
.@SenWarren Do you feel in charge?
Go Pochahantas. 
why is Ivanka being set up with west wing office, security clearance and comm device, but no title?
@PatGregg2 Betsy DeVos : Not the sharpest pencil in the pencil box.

don't u have some work to do instead of harassing a sec.
Instead of the American dream I ended up with a monster debt.
I should call you Mad Dog Warren, because you are smart, and tactful. Fighting for whats right!
Everyone conflicts but Democrats. 
Wow! You're bucky bad ass, then, aren't ya?? 
Just how deep dies Trump's admin corruption go. It's mind boggling. Do let them get away with this crap.
Power. You got power, Elizabeth. Now back to your soaps.
@MAHAMOSA you're a bulldog....
Get 'em, Sen.
What does one have to do with the other?
thank you for all you do for us!! Please don't stop fighting for the little ppl 
It's funny that you pretend like she cares what you think. Please Please Plesae run for President in 2020.
please check your spelling. 
Maybe if you write to DeVos' boss about her obvious conflicts, she'd resign too!
@LisaKBromley #justaddzebras
Write some more letter. A lot more letters. A lot more.
@sturgeongal @business I don't use this word often but I HATE these people!!! 
It's WHY All his Cabinet Secs had the Goal of Destroying their Depts~A way to Break the Bank for Billionaire Special Int$
warren how come you have donations from foreign governments?
thank God you are working for the children of America. Trump and his minions certainly aren't
Crap, your desperation showing.
I wish they all resign
Why cant Dems stop this? And why r only billionaires allowed to claim bankrupcy but ppl cant pay STUDENT LOANS CANNOT?
Because ppl would borrow all they could in the name of student loans, graduate w/ a degree then file BR.
Like billionaires do?  My question remains.
Thank you for fighting for our future children!
no surprise this whole #45 administration is corrupt as we witnessed today it is just the beginning #ImpeachTrump NOW!
Those of us with our eyes open are not surprised. Keep pressing Senator.
The letter-and-resignation story cracks me up a bit :-)
http://www.usatoday.com/story/onpolitics/2013/01/08/elizabeth-warren-native-american-senate-directory/1818059/ … ?????????????????????????????????
Odd she didn't bring up WJC association with Laureate Univ when HRC was at DOS or running 4 POTUS.
It's DeVos who needs to go! She's killing public ed & esp HIGHER ed.
And Grizzly Bears.
GOP feels it's made progress when an unqualified corrupt female stands shoulder 2 shoulder with an unqualified corrupt male boss.
??????
WHY do these people pretend to be religious but they're all crooked criminals?! @BetsyDeVos
@DeanLeh @business can you have her resign. She's making harder for me to pay back my student loans.
@Alice00581238 @LifecoachNV16 @Joseph64686625 Lizzy Questions EVERYTHING!  Like,Why does she pee standing up?Why is she not ndn
Just love this one!!!!
Yay, thank you for trying to protect us. DeVos is unethical and in a fugue when she speaks about her love of education.
@birdiealways hopefully she is next
That would be awesome b4 she does anymore damage! These people are fast at destruction! They all need to go! #RESIST
Mrs warren would you please resign? Take Bernie with you!

http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2012/10/15/16-million-of-warren-donations-came-through-websites-lacking-foreign-donor-protections/ … @SenWarren
it's appalling to realize these people actually think they're doing America a favor, or doing a good thing.. are they really that naive?
thank you Senator Warren...Keep fighting the good fight!
@dahlia201 way to go Senator !!!!
you know she hold a higher position that you right? Show some damn respect.
student debt is one of the biggest issues of my generation. It shackles us from growing financially after college.
Please Go Away! You hypocrite! he
The Faux Squaw has spoken
Thanks for keeping an eye on that one. Waiting for he plans for ed but I know what they will be-PRIVATIZE
HOW can we stop this corruption? Rich people in power now making the rich richer. It's a TRAVESTY!
"You got paid $350,000 to teach a single college class" via @KatiePavlich
Healthcare is about tax cuts.  Education is about loan scams.  Financial planners make the investor # 2.  Get it?
Prosecution upon failure to disclose of conflicts.
Persistence pays off!  Thank you for staying on this!
only temporarily, for bear hunting.  Sad.
This entire group is robbing the US blind while they can -kids, friends, & foes taking it all now- cause they can
https://conservativenews247.com/news/30250_warren_sets_record_half_her_donations_from_online_sites_vulnerable_to_fraud_and_foreign_donations … why are most of your donations from foreign govts? @SenWarren
Thank you Sen Warren, As an infectious disease researcher w/ substantial student loans I just want to save lives, very bit helps.
are you bragging?
thank you Ms. Warren. Please fight for us who don't have the clout to be heard. We appreciate you. #standuptohate
she don't want to talk to a lier,fake Indian
How many sub-$0.25 ramen noodle packs some students survive on would equate one meal billionaire @BetsyDeVos enjoys daily?
