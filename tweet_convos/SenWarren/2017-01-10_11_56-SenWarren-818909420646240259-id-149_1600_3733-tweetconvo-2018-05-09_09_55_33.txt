Elizabeth Warren is shocked, SHOCKED, to learn that restaurant staff make minimum wage. Biggest 8yr jobs growth?
repeat.  How about some new material Pocahantis
one of the 1% where are the young people. Enough followed Bernie. dems wake up. It's young people!!!
you're a bit late to this party aren't you Senator Warren? Modern times require INSTANTANEOUS responses.
And who wishes to eliminate federal minimum wage.
The open border proponents.   So you can eat your tofu taco cheaper.
Sure. We took YOU in, didn't we? We take ANYBODY even doofuses. I hate tofu. Eat meat. Bigot.
Bigot really?
Keep up the good work. It is appreciated .
I hear his pic for drug czar is Ozzy Osbourne.
Oh, I thought it was Joaquin Guzman!
what do you expect from someone as unqualified as @realDonaldTrump
LOL!! Woah there, snowflake! GOP for decades. All good.
@XOGOSSIPGIRLDC1 @realDonaldTrump there indian.....
:Is there any other way to win any seats/ election other than talking bad about each other party leadership?
And who values his employees so much that he wants to replace them with robots. So caring.
@maudglib @realDonaldTrump attack Tillerson
stop the hate. We are going to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
I hear the FBI couldn't comment whether Trump is being investigated. I wouldn't load the moving truck just yet
They never affirm or deny any investigations is my understanding. I think will be inaugurated.
They will often deny actually. They can do that and is common if it's true.
sorry he's already confirmed by senate. You lost. Get over it
Warren, if I was Prez, I would definitely make sure U were in the first swamp that is drained!
Wonder if Kentucky Fried Chicken being served at inauguration dinner. #NotMyPresidentElect #Resist
you got to be the dumbest in government 
Dumbest women ever!!!!
Take care of your house before you throw rocks at http://others.You  have lied and profitted from those lies, non native
GREAT! Did you expect anything better from this idiot? And, YES, America IS interested in his tax returns.
please do not confirm these cabinet picks. They like Trump are unfit to serve.
And who wants to replace cashiers with ordering kiosks.
Burger Chains that EMPLOYEE hundreds of thousands of people...
hundreds of thousands..? Your numbers are way off. (Spelling too)
please stick to the facts since Lizzy Borden cannot...she's gonna lose the election!
Don't forget, he hates the idea of a minimum wage, but likes to abuse women, like his ex-wife.  What a guy.
and you lied about being indian to get a teaching gig!
12022243121 tell congress to focus on Tilllerson. We the people can fight the rest of picks
, @realDonaldTrump: YES! Pay workers less, they'll put more into the economy. Simple math that media won't report. UNFAIR! Sad.
@BlueZones I won't patronize chain anyone joining me? Eat Blue Zone oops!! Koch Bros killing bees
Anyone surprised? I'm not. Unqualified bad choices are Orangy's M.O. #unqualifiedBaffoon
That also doesn't pay a living wage.
u have the worst cabinets most are unethical or conflict of interest but no surprise coming from trump
How does any1 operate a business wOUT violations? Pages&pages of regs snuffing out bus.Thx.
omg this is a twilight zone episode
Senator, do not forget education!!!!
Have you checked into the slaughterhouses? Of coarse fucking not! Same as with the Palestinians, you don't care!
...and who has repeatedly approved advertising campaigns objectifying women. I'm guessing equal pay is out.
#THATISTRUMPSTUPID

would you like fries with that?
Goofus how about stealing NYTPierre Franey's crab with mayo recipes for PowWow Chow? Copyright Law Violator?
how can we let a man who shows us every day that he has a psychological disorder be our President!
Noting PEOTUS is not fit to be POTUS! I wouldn't expect DT cabinet picks to be qualified for any appointments!
And his pick will be confirmed because democrats don't have enough votes to prevent it.  That's heap big truth.
Warren go make yourself useful you friggin wanna be Indian !
And who threatened to automate all of his restaurants if Trump lost.
Let's note that numerous Union members voted one of the worst sweat shop operators in the country 4 labor chief!
And @realDonaldTrump said he's hire the "best" people. The best to destroy our people and nation. #ResistTrump

Nothing quite like 'the fox guarding the hen house' right? 
We'll fight Trumps swamp at every level
the question is why do ppl feel like he was a better alternative!! What do the Dems offer - esp 2 low info vote
I find it very interesting that you like to talk about Trump how about bringing something up about Clinton.
Why not. All his other pics are rotten! What's one more? DUMP TRUMP
And once again thank you Senator for your tireless vigilance!!
How many of his employees get their healthcare because of ACA?  Corporate welfare: Walmart, Papa Johns, etc
literally not a problem once @atty_sessions drops the case. Good thinking ahead by @reeljonaldtrunp #checkmate

@PurlLeslie @realDonaldTrump and half naked women eating burgers well right in line with Bill O:Reilly and trump
@Plaid_Undercat @realDonaldTrump 
I hope #TheResistance has already been boycotting his chains. Our family has.
is this fact or your personal perspective?
and the #DNC did what about it over the 8 years #Obama was President??


@MarkDavidAnder9 @realDonaldTrump 

Yeah, but what about those burgers- puke on a bun !
thank you for fighting for this he people Senator Warren! #realsuperhero #Resistance
Yeah he has no respect for anyone who works for him. Jerk
don't forget demeaning women. When I think worker's rights, I think half naked women washing cars eating burgers
My god, every single appointment is trash. I don't actually believe in the devil, but is @realDonaldTrump the FREAKING DEVIL?
union busting and labor violations are the goals of the new labor dept! NOT workers rights!
sen Warren you are such a child
Wrong again, Liz. Dang, are the libs still steaming jealous? Simmer down. It will be GOP for decades.
oh wow that's just awful Elizabeth. He also has given thousands of jobs and promotions.Do something good !
We know. He is nothing but a lying sack of garbage. So now what?
and so it begins,plutocracy in america!!!!!...sadly,one step away from fascism.
Take this attitude into work with you! This is the only way to fight back. Do not let this Dumpster Fire burn us
Trump is such a joke. Please stop him.
well - DUH!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6hsL4Z9yn0 …
And the insanity continues!
He wants to have a workforce of robots.
#pocahontas been hittin the peace pipe a little too heavy, eh?
I'd rather smoke that peace pipe with @SenWarren than mess with that cocaine The Donald is snorting.
And crummy burgers!
@CherylCassel1 @realDonaldTrump could they have elected a bigger idiot ?  I don't think so.
who would you pick? A sub 15/hr worker?

https://www.walgreens.com/topic/promotion/rednoseday.jsp …
Every fast food chain has had such alleged allegations.  BE HONEST FOR ONCE!
Dude is a straight chump.
Social Service Training Institute
he'll do a great job, slave wages for all, putting America back to work, terrific #trumpsserfs
senator, stop trying to thread the needle and speak more forcefully.  Trump cabal are dangerous immoral thieves.
senator these hearings are a farce of polite boys club enabling on both sides. Where is the outrage? Why we lost
Call him out! Give him hell! @realDonaldTrump
Your pick for President was pro-#TPP.
Will there ever be a positive, pro-America, anti-Russian addition to this Admin.?
Lie.a.honas who lied on her resume 2 get a job is UNFIT 2 be a US Senator! She has no right to question anyone about anything! She's a LIAR!
"chains" are generally individual franchises owned by families. 
#WheresTheBeef, Chief?
 @realDonaldTrump
so?
No better man to protect America's workers than one who knows exactly what the violations are!
The foxes are being put in charge of the hen house..that's clear. D's won't bare-knuckle brawl like R's, so they will all pass. 
Maybe some of those laws need to be changed.
yes @realDonaldTrump wants to make us a cheap labor market. He advocates workers as slaves
.@SenWarren Sounds legit. The person to best enforce the violations is the one who broke them repeatedly. Like @realDonaldTrump & his taxes
sure and will probably get worse when he lifts restrictions/ regulations.  I believe that will open doors for lots of lawsuits
hello my favorite thing they do to me is give me less than. 24 hrs a wk keeping me part time and forcing me to work multiple job
Labor law violations?  Have you investigated McDonald's lately? I worked there when I was a kid 40 yrs ago.
Fauxahontas
Who else to keep the minimum wage minimum. #MitchTheBitch #Filibuster #ShutItDown #Resist #Obstruct #rotten
NETFLIX $60B LOOT RACKET WHISTLEBLOWER NEED DEBATE WITH TRAITOR CONGRESS.SENATE R NOW
welcome to the new America Libertarian party Government git America one agency at a time

I think you need to change "days" to "hours", otherwise there's no chance for it to change from 0.
Good point.
no fan of this choice either!  #NoTrumpNWay
AND who would replace every human working for him the second an automation option became available!
let's not mention the caloric intake to make diners walking heartattacks.
And each of these will be aired in his confirmation hearing, I hope.
Do not judge Trump by what he says. judge him by what he does & the people he chooses to surround himself with.
There's a shock. 
omg fry him up and serve him with a side of fries mom!!!!
, I'm confident that if confirmed, his businesses won't be cited for any violations during his term (gratuitous sarcasm intended)
hahaha "trump's pick to protect workers" nope he gives a  about those people
Yeah, but have you seen their TV ads? Positive portrayals of women abound! #NotTrue #SAD

Is that a typo? ...not to protect America's company owners? @eileen_gunn @realDonaldTrump
person sick
Example 105 that trump lied for votes. Draining the swamp by pumping in sewage.
Trump voters just buy into the Russian propaganda with the Clinton email scandal.
Echo Chambers
good right? he should save the government some money! repeal,replace later, build wall, get paid later, no breaks, get it cheaper in china,?
So what's new about his groonies.
So very Trump of him to do this.
A fox in every henhouse
doesn't surprise anyone.  Everyone he picks is a criminal
Or a racist white supremacist.
crybaby snowflake.. we are doing business hear ..go play cowboys and Indians again
i am unimpressed
par for the course and another sad, pathetic, choice
can't we just wake up from this nightmare!  This incoming person and cabinet choices scare the heck out of me
We feel your pain.
Thank you for fighting for the real people in America. Stay strong. We need you. <3
so true
carl's Jr. is nasty
