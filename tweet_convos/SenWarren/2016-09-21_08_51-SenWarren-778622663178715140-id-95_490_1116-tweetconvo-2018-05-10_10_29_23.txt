- Senator Warren YOU are brave and fearless against the no good, lazy, whiney, polluting GOP! Keep it up! 
: Can you give more details?
@MorningConsult Senate holding the country hostage for their own benefit should be grounds for them all to be fired.
Bravo!!! we need more people in the Senate like you.
@MorningConsult 
Yawn.
#DoYourJob Vote the GOP out of office! They have done nothing for 8 Years!! #nevertrump
@MorningConsult wish you were running as the democratic candidate

Wasn't Dodd Frank suppose to handle this?  Guess the Democrats failed again.
Public corporations MUST report their political spending in order to prevent the C-board from acting against sholders
It does Sholders no good to enable fraud and loosen reporting and regulations. ONLY the fraudsters at the top win
@MorningConsult Go Senator we need you. Tell it loke it is thank you very much
Has dem leadership looked in the mirror?
concerning Mr. stupmf Et.al. Senior execs should not face jail time. THEY SHOULD DO JAIL TIME. they are not the same.

God Bless You for Your Voice! Is Right!
You picked the wrong side, Senator.
well....that sounds a lot like what Trump preaches...
but when you play the system to claim you're a Native American that is OK, right?
Consumer banking model: "Identify new ways to rip off customers. Move on when they figure it out and complain."
@MorningConsult none an i mean NONE OF YOU HAVE DONE YOUR JOBS &we pay your salary so maybe York salaries should STOP
"We're" seems too much like "together," under the heel.
it would be foolish to suggest this was limited to GOP- DEMs are just as guilty.

Ready!
I'm a big fan EW (even though you didn't endorse Bernie). Give 'em hell! Thanks for all you do.
YES we are, Sen @elizabethforma ! Thank you!
