Rool up your sleeves and fly on over. Monday quarter backing is your cup of tea.
Why aren't u asking the mayor why 1 of her officers is saying she is the one refusing to give out the relief supplies, Fauxcahontas?

You mean self inflicted bullying by the mayor?
Most PR citizens on welfare and there's mass corruption that has gone unchecked for years. Over $90 BILLION in debt!
PR needs help, not bullying, from its own Mayor.
You are FOS! Period. #GasBagHag
.WARREN YOU ARE THE NASTY BULLY! YOU ARE SO GULLIBLE & IRRESPONSIBLE! Repeating without confirming is so typical for @DNC SUCH A MEAN WOMEN!

You're such a dispicable and unlikable person.
We cannot forget about the Virgin Islands. People suffering there. #Forgotten

Donate to the Red Cross, the people of 9/11 2001 are still in dire assistance, we need to find more reasons to donate to THE RED CROSS
Good thing @POTUS isn’t bullying like you and other democrats. Look at that 1 democratic Mayor. Who refuses to help and then complains. SMH

You're a political monster #MAGA

The New Democrats party and Warren supports these people

What's REALLY going on in Puerto Rico
+a little perspective on the San Juan Mayor
whose description of US efforts contradicts the Governor's 
Please explain why    Congress misses deadline to reauthorize key children's healthcare program No Funds
I've seen plenty of cases of water and other goods sitting on the dock, where are the people to move it?  Stop the FAKE news .... MAGA
Ms @SenWarren please stop being so partisan. It's embarrassing to think you are an American politician! You only represent yourself.
Dems making reference to God always a joke with their ongoing push to make private business owners to abandon their beliefs and be forced to
Participate in gay marriages.
And what have you done besides run your mouth. Can't believe People from Massachusetts are proud of you
We need YOU!!!! WARREN 2020!
She lied about her Native American heritage. She's done ZERO for Massachusetts. She does nothing but obstruct and nothing to help... POTUS?

The mayor of San Juan lied as she stood in front of tons of supplies. She looked so stupid.
the fact that you have a following is behond me

@realDonaldTrump @FEMA
@DeptofDefense @NHC_Atlantic
Mayor SABOTAGING Relief Efforts Out of HATE
4@POTUS
…
Thank you Senator Warren for standing up for the PR people who need help not hateful attacks.
God's work would be a plague on the Democrat party.  Instead, the Democrat party is a plague on America.
PR needs help. Maybe you can look into this:
You're a fool. He sent boatloads of help. Funny how even when the right thing is being done. You democrat whack jobs try and spin the story.
Thanks @SenWarren, please keep us informed of what help we are doing, it's breaking my heart 
What she is doing is spreading lies on,FB. Look up,the Governors comments if you want the truth.
Pres Trump hasn't bullied anyone. We all knew PR was a mess before the hurricanes. He commented on what is true.
Or lies from you and your other liberals

What have you done??? Just  putting out Liberal FAke BS.. thats all you can do, we will vote you out!!!

Yea, everyone there, is on strike, why?
You are a clown @SenWarren . PR's Governor: “The president and the administration, every time we’ve asked them to execute, they’ve executed.
So get down there and help!
Bullying is when you have to lie your way to survive in your life.  Lie lie lie - sensationalize everything.  Gettin old


We don't need to hear from a hard left mayor lying about the help PR is getting because she's a Trump hater.
BOMBSHELL CLAIM: San Juan Mayor SABOTAGING Relief Efforts to Make Trump Look Bad – Truthfeed http://ow.ly/7pIb30fyjl3  #SundayMorning 
Truth is,not welcome here!!!!!


What would you know about God? You need to get on the next plane to PR, stop the concern trolling, and lend a hand.
needs leaders in Congress who can work together, not throw around false unsubstantiated allegations.
Please, check you stats before speaking. Military, first responders, supplies are there-more on the way.
"Mayor of San Juan bravely delivering badly needed truckloads of reporters, to hurricane victims". Off 2 photo op, need that food for props!
Could use some valid reporting. Not a Puerto Rican #Demwho is only doing photo ops for the Dem resistance, instead of her job.
Wow 
I notice you're not there, Liz. They could use your "Native American Know-how".. You could bunk w/Cruz. She has everything you'd need..
you laugh too when the Mayor stood there and laughed when she said - dying like the genocide vitims here in Puerto rico???
Humm
Yes relief workers do a great job but its their work not the work of the God who would be creating these disasters if they existed.
Yes in lieu of an all seeing all compassionate non-violent god we have #ReliefWorkers
It annoys when God is used as if a proven entity, especially in politics where religion doesn't belong.

Keep your political agenda out of PR Elizabeth - it's disingenuous
Bullying?We been there for days helping under US orders so what exactly is your contribution besides your distaste?The US is helpin PR's!

What about the supplies sitting on the docs with your liberal pal said Trump has done nothing, both of you are LIARS
They need help, not politics!  Quit trying to make this political.  You'll fail.
I don't know about "God" statement.  Just get working on fixing and not pointing the finger.  Tired of the finger pointing, just tired!
Not only US citizens, many of them are Vets. A true embarrassment for POTUS!
Look,up the governors comments if you want the truth. I know liberals have a hard time with truth.
Here's that strong blonde woman in front of all the supplies she says she doesn't have.
 @TwitterSupport
WHY NOT SEND FOR   THE CLINTON FOUNDATION?  ha ha ha ha
Partisan Mayor of San Juan=liar who attacked military+POTUS to score votes from tragedy;Her unions refuse2 truck aid:
.@FEMA: search & rescue teams have visited all 78 PR municipalities, saving/assisting 843 individuals (& 5 pets), searching 2600+ structures

You continue to lie to the public abt. the Pres. I ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO READ THE LIST OF WHAT THE PRES. HAS MADE AVAILABLE TO PUERTO RICO!

Bombshell: Alleged Puerto Rican Cop calls radio station claims mayor #CarmenYulinCruz  is sabotaging relief sent by POTUS #SundayMorning 
Liar.  What about the 10,000 relief workers sent to PR?  How about reporting the truth.
Antifa and the Alt-left is good for the democratic party! So is the Muslim religion which alienates the Hispanics! What is a Dem to do?

RETWEET THIS EVERYWHERE #PuertoRicoRelief 
America has a long history of helping those in need.
America is sending help.
Are other countries going to help Puerto Rico?
Until Trump walks in the shoes of the Puerto Rico people, he has no idea what he's yapping about. He should have been their already instead of blaming fake news like he always does. Shameful.
Well Elizabeth if its gods work then he should bring his ass down here and do his job. God has nothing to do with the thousands who above all believe in serving humanity not some god.
All Trump knows how to do BULLY maybe his wife needs to train him
stop politicizing the tragedy in PR.  If you want to help, get on a plane and go down there to help.
A panicked politician is like a panicked swimmer being rescued. They will take anyone down with them. Besides, y'all (Dems) attract her
You’re a waist of air, skin and space. 
Where do people like you come from. The Devil’s spawn.
Oh man, all the dirty nasty ass trolls are weighing in on PR.  More people died in Chicago once again this weekend where there’s no support
You're lying!
How is he bullying Dizzy? Just Asking! Have you increased the pay of your female staff yet? You hypocrite!
Amen.ALL of  AMERICA needs help, not #DonaldTrump.  It is imperative the SOB be removed. He has created total chaos
Pocahontas is an American legend. On otherhand, you don't even qualify as a POS.
Send you to tax payer funded Gulag
And not sure what you mean about them doing Gods work in cleaning up...
Instead of tweeting negatively about @POTUS from your $million home, dig in to your wallet and get your ass out there to help!
Lots of WH lip flapping will not help people w/o power, clean water, food, shelter
POCAHONTAS @SenWarren has no Moral grounds to be outraged... WHAT-IS-SHE-DOING??? #RESIST IS ALL...
Put a Stop to Bullying!

He’s only concerned about his ego. Not people.  He has abused his power and made a mockery of the Office. Commander in chief of hatred

God is a man made constuct to explain unexplainable.  We have a creator but no 'God'
Trump is a phony and fake patriot! He cares not about the Americans or America! Only himself! His ego! His bank account! Shame!
Sen Warren, encourage them to move out on their own and not wait for Tricky Dickey Pres Trump.  W/O orders young soldiers saved lives.

It is all Trump knows, bullying anyone and everyone that does not bow to him. A terrible president, leader and person.
He's NOT a @POTUS he's a #PseudoPOTUS.
you are a hero to the world
Senator Warren what will it take to remove an unfit leader from office?
Shh!!
Oh Liz...
Oh, Liz...

Because of #FakeNews my people are not getting the credit they deserve for doing a great job. As seen here, they are ALL doing a GREAT JOB! 
51 of 69 hospitals taking patients, half of grocery/big box stores  open11 major highways cleared & over 60% of fuel stations open

Even animals help each other when it needed. There are non believers helping as well. Thank you for your voice Senator!
Reality
CNN would hate if these facts about the Trump Admin's extensive Puerto Rico relief efforts went viral 
Bs is what you meant to say
Do you do anything besides tweet?
