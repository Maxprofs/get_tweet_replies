This man is disgrace for legal profession.
he's a white nationalist like all from the south of his age. Believe me Jim Crow is alive in south.
Why believe u? I lived in several states North & South.  I find u wrong! #Blocking
Then you aren't paying attention! Racism is RAMPANT in TX, LA, MS, etc. 
@GaLiberal @LegalKant @SenWarren @SenatorSessions

What the fuck does me showing proof where I've voted have to do with racism in those states?
@NoneYaBeesWax4 @GaLiberal @LegalKant
oooh. Potty mouth word. Lib must be angry. Jump up and down. Cry.
You ppl are ridiculous with your 'lib' insults. Get a new play book, that one's shredded. @NoneYaBeesWax4 @GaLiberal @LegalKant
Hope you read it slowly, those REPUBLICANS don't seem too bright..
attacking intelligence of opposite party just gives credible that Dems r elitists.
I served in Intelligence! Not one of these has the I.Q. to graduate the US Intel. Academy!
You are wrong about that. And Mr. Sessions will be confirmed
Her front looks just like her back. #RobinWilliams
Everybody in the Cabinet and Executive Office is unfit to even walk a dog
Blanket statements equal uneducated morons.
@NearSightedGirl @SenatorSessions @washingtonpost Hmmmm!  Why didn't you read this though?
@chris63414391 @SenWarren @NearSightedGirl @SenatorSessions @washingtonpost Warren shouldn't be pointing any fingers at anyone
Get over it.  Warren is great.
Great  being a liar.
no you're confusing her with Kellyanne Conway.
Nah.
Yaaa Senator Warren! You go get them. What the Rebulicans are doing is so wrong!
bravo Sen Warren
Warren=Idoit
THANK YOU for standing tall.
I was in Oklahoma NOT recovering frm layoffs when she passed

daaaaaaaaaammmmmmnnnnn. Wow. 
@SenateMajLdr that letter was already entered in congressional record & you just said DR MLK's widows words don't matter. #FAIL
it wasn't entered into the record because the racist Strom Thurmond didn't allow it. Read the article.
obviously you're not a racist Mr. But numb so what are you what category do you fall into
I don't explain myself to eggs, sorry.
but you can block them!
Days into Black History Month, @SenateGOP tried to silence words of Coretta Scott King (via @SenWarren @motherjones)
SHE IS PLAYING YOU FOR VOTES. SHE DOESNT CARE ABOUT YOU OR MLK. WAKE UP. SHE IS A POLITICAL HACK.
Thank you @SenWarren I applaud you!
I USED TO BE A DEMOCRAT AFTER LISTEN TO SENATOR WARREN I VOTED FOR TRUMP! Warren IS ANTI AMERICAN !!

Thank You @SenWarren for all your hard work. You are loved and appreciated.
We are screwed by this racist hack and the entire cabinet. Do they hate democracy or working people the most?

Nevertheless, she persisted.
Absofuckinlutely

Truth is always the ultimate defense to accusations of trolling. I have no need.
Bye boy

According @SenateGOP, it's okay to be a racist, you just can't call a racist a racist.
@WritePurpose @SenatorSessions @washingtonpost HEYA HEYA HEYA HEYA
You were told to sit!  Woof woof!  Now go fetch the rules and learn to bring yourself to heel!
don't just sit down TAKE A Nap ...NASTY WOMEN
Keep speaking truth--they must be afraid if your reading of an open letter gets this response.
@emilynussbaum @SenatorSessions @washingtonpost they just showed it on MSNBC
AND YOU WERE RIGHT! @SenateMajLdr was UNAMERICAN in his attempt to silence you!
@MitchMcConell 
What was done to @SenWarren tonight was disgraceful.  Free speech and democracy is in peril
You keep it up; she persists is right! Someone named mom persisted for everyone and good thing they did!
Maybe we should read your fake indian cookbook on the Senate floor as well.
This backfired on McConnell. I have now read and forwarded the letter. Powerful stuff! #TheStreisandEffect
I am neither Dem or Rep, but what's right is right, and what's wrong has to be addressed!

#LetCorettaSpeak
@TerrieWilliams @washingtonpost Keep fighting. When u can't fight any more, stand here & fight any how. Song: "WE Are Soldiers!"
@Tribeca @SenatorSessions @washingtonpost Warren, you are about as legitimate a leader as @HillaryClinton colluding with @CNN
but Cruz can quote Dr. Seuss?
keep fighting the good fight.
You're a Senator, you all know the rules. You knew you were wrong. They did the right thing.
@washingtonpost please read the definition of populism & encourage everyone to come together in small community
@lampsnotjewelry @SenatorSessions @washingtonpost @realDonaldTrump President Trump is a paranoid man with little hands
Tweet the letter-post it on FB-recirculate it!
We Knew Sessions track record. Republicans times up Democracy will not be Silent! #2018Vote
@CoryBooker @SenatorSessions @washingtonpost you knew the consequences of your actions, you rolled the dice, it was calculated
Such disrespect for Sen Warren.
.@SenWarren @SenatorSessions @washingtonpost 1986? Really? Ok... If that is the test. Watch out ...
too bad the GOP infringed on your freedom.of speech to hide the truth.
Because you are phenomenal, Senator Warren. Thank you.
Sessions may try 2 cover up past wrong doings he can't wash them away.Letter frm CSK/witnesses
Thank you for fighting the good fight @SenWarren & speaking on behalf of millions of Americans and #CivilRights
looks like your wanna be a native American ass got tossed out lol.
and I hope that more women seek positions in Congress and the Senate and will not be silenced by
@CoryBooker @SenatorSessions @washingtonpost i hope you remember this when you get majority. #fightfirewithfire
McConnell should be ashamed, stopped her from reading a citizens letter, that's the simple truth
Keep speaking out...we are listening! And we will remember in 2018 & 2020!
NO! This behavior needs to stop and now.
@TheKevinDent @SenatorSessions @washingtonpost It was wrong of them to stop you. Sessions is evil.
embarrassed to have you as my senator. Where are policy's?and why always throw up the race card?
lizzy is a beast I love her
please stop. Mr Sessions from being sworn in.
@CoryBooker @SenatorSessions @washingtonpost Amazing.R's rebuke Warren,but most let DJT's comments outrageous on Russia slide.
#senwarren that was how many years ago??? Was that about the time you claimed to be native Indian!!!!!!
Violation of Free Speech...wrong, wrong, wrong....& Black History Month????
We the people no who stands with us & against us. Keep up the fight & thank you! #TheResistance
@AlvedaCKing MLK’s niece says Elizabeth Warren is improperly taking advantage of King name
Thank you, Sen Warren. Have begged for CSK letter to be read.
#impeachtrump
fauxcohontas has some serious nerve! Thank God they shut her up.
keep fighting for us, Sen. Warren!
@Lawrence @SenatorSessions @washingtonpost The Alt Right or White Supremace are elated they finally will have a racist brother AG
Telling Senator Warren to stop reading a relevant letter about Sessions by Ms. King  is deplorable
Black people do not speak for us , you just need their vote Liberal !
Senate Republicans, will get theirs in 2018.
Shows exactly what Sessions is...against women...radical right...Trumpie puppet!
Thanks so much 4 fighting the good fight! To bad not 1 more repub had the balls to stand with you. #ResistTrump
. I so appreciate you & ur colleagues. Please stay strong for us.
and yet MLKs son and attorney support Trump-believe n his judgement of AG Sessions. #wasteoftime
don't lie, you were warned because of what you read from Ted Kennedy, but you kept going #liar
Because what happened in 1986 is soooo relevant 31 years later.
Hillary praises KKK leader as her mentor and Pocahontas doesn't say a peep.
Sessions used his office to intimidate black voters, Mrs King said. Y wasn't he charged? Jailed?
@Lawrence @SenatorSessions  We believe U should have been able 2 read the letter. We also understand how cantankerous U've become
it's absolutely relevant to this hearing! Shame on you, you old coot @SenateMajLdr
.@SenWarren @SenatorSessions @washingtonpost
you did everything right! Thank you!!

I am disgusted by the behavior of the Senators. You are a warrior and I thank you!

McConnell is a disgrace and a discredit to this country.  Thank you, Senator Warren!
@EvaMcBain09 @SenatorSessions @washingtonpost I fully support you!! #carryon
Mr. Sessions, so excited to see one of Satan's crew in such a calling! Sell your soul Buddy!
Republicans, especially Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan need to be voted out.

#letlizspeak . You better let her speak. She is at the mountain top.
@Your assertiveness,valor and respect are characteristics of a true leader. Thank U for unveiling the truth.
