Glad to see the taxpayer's money going to your salary is being well spent.  Can we get a refund?
Shame on u for standing by while DNC clinton foundation & podesta group get away w stealing democracy #ImWithJILL #PodestaEmails5

LOL

If you were #Hillary you'd ask for their $$$ first, then have a public/private opinion--and then change view (#TPP #IraqWar).
who is the hottie you are with in the cranberries ?
You should have fought for Bernie before Massachusetts primary. He was denied a domino effect because of your spinelessness.
@VP would say this is a pretty bog deal.
#CrazyElizabethWarren
Why do you support Hillary? She takes $$$ from big banks like Wells Fargo & terrorized sexual assault victims.
HYPOCRITE!
Cranberries are the BEST!  :0)
I'm not against cranberries, but can you recommend so.ething where the taste doesn't overwhelm? Oh, and next time run for pres.
hello mom,,how are you to day.?
mummy please have pity on me please you can save me mummy please don't abandon mw I really need your help please mummy
Yes, it is sad, a very sad comment. Why bother?
Go girl, you're a fighter & an inspiration! Glad you're keeping the CEOs accountable too!
As you can see. This is someone who is working on the right things one month before elections
What Trump said was not words - it was an invitation to approve sexual abuse. Debating on a college campus - calling it banter?
by raising taxes and forcing them to pay for people illegally in the country. I'm sure they don't want your help.
we can smell victory.. Keep up the hard work.. We are watching the next big wave.. Hillary our next President
I can’t believe after all your hard work you’re getting bogged down in this… 
BAHAHAHA IS THIS CRANBERRY HERITAGE LIKE YOU FAKE NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE?
- Cranberries?
Fraud, HYPOCRITE, liar are all things describing Sen Elizabeth Warrem
Dear Senator, on behalf of my  kidneys and tastebuds - thank you!

HILLARY 4 PRISON 2016

@jefferson_party stands with America's small farmers!
miss homemade cran-apple jelly since moving from Boston - you are making me homesick!
How?
but hopefully not big sugar
@dogmonologue
Relevant John Oliver (you'll have to watch a minute before it gets cranberry) :
"You didn't grow that!"
me too! At the boggs
Just like you are fighting for #WSDarling #RegimeChangeWarsChampion #TTPGoldStandard #DoubleTalkChampion
How about your Native American heritage? Did you find any family artifacts in the bog? #fraud
queen of cranberries

Hi-ho-the-dairy-o
Activist senator in the bog
Elizabeth Warren backed Hillary from the beginning but didn't make an endorsement out of cowardice. #PodestaEmails2 shame !
I didn't know cranberries could vote!
Keep up the good fight! 
Liz, @HillaryClinton has no shot to win. I will win it all. #Tatiana
You fight when there's no risk to jeopardize your political status. just like when you didn't endorse Bernie in the Primary.
Happy coop month! #nationalcooperativemonth #oceanspray
Fighting for a TPP deal to put them under Lizzy?
guessing those cranberry growers are part of profit making corporations. So it's just taxpayer handouts to big business. Got it
What are you fighting about, exactly?
more TOM TOMs wow!
ok,@SenWarren
