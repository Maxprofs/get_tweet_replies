When are you going to hear the victims of the EPA's poisoning of the Colorado River? Or of the Community Reinvestment Act?
Americans have had enough of the #SchumersClown show @SenWarren @SenSchumer
Still so #SAD that only the victims paid the price for this whole scam/housing bubble/collapse
Regardless of politics, children look up to you. What does it say to them when you won't shake the hand of a political foe? Shame
That she's not a fake F@#$! If you actually care about kids then stop opposing those who fight for them!
Not exactly sure what your point is, but not shaking hands with a political adversary is deplorable behavior.
of course you don't get my point... Deplorable behavior? Omg dude, get a life!
You have no point. A person who accepts 400k to teach 1 class and complains about student loans isn't 'helping' kids. Research Liddy
You're classless.

Please move to Pyongyang; their political system is a better look on you.

Thank you for fighting for us ! The Republican party does not think of all the people they are affecting. Trump is not my President.
Thank you for rising to and exceeding the expectations of the public office you serve and giving citizens a voice in our capitol.
rising is having the ability to make nearly 1/2 a mil to part-time teach? She was very easily corrupted in DC
