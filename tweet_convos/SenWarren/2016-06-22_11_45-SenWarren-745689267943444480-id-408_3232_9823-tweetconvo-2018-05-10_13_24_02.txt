Did you hear the dinner bell?  #Hypocrites
@ChiaLynn @HouseDemocrats Are you going to talk to gun owners or just splain to us?
This isn’t really about “gun owners.” I’ve been a gun owner. I grew up in a family of hunters.
Who gives a shit about your upbringing? Obviously a poor one if you think trampling on my Second Amendement is okay.
They only refer to Constitution when its convenient. So sad.
It's so heroic how you are fighting to replace due process with secret lists. Shame on you.
Thanks Senator Warren - & a Happy Birthday to you! Thanks for spending your day speaking for the people. Brava!
Maybe she'll have a bday cake to further the obstructionism.
Don't let the cobwebs deter you.
Elizabeth Warren is a Goofey dope
At last the penny has dropped on the Hill.  America can no longer put up with the massive cost of gun violence.

@tvaziri @SenWarren @HouseDemocrats HOFOR
Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!! God bless!
I just threw up in my mouth thinking of this fake ass bitch sitting on the floor protesting violence. With hilary
@saraconway @HouseDemocrats it's not just a House thing #itsalegislativething
this is what us powerless consumers have to resort to. you are supposed to be governing, not performing. TOOL
You sit-Indian style?
.@SenWarren @HouseDemocrats Thank you for doing your job!
Don't you mean not doing their job? All they're doing is wasting time. Sad.
Worried about the "no fly" part.
 Where is due process in all of this.
@pilatesandpeace @HouseDemocrats @MomsDemand Thank You Senator Warren!

YES! THANKYOU! #NoBillNoBreak #holdthefloor #goodtrouble
.@SenWarren is a true champion for #Massachusetts. Proud #mapoli is united in saying it's time to #StopGunViolence.
Warren is a phony balogna water moccassin. 

SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED.
And an obstructionist! Another symptom of the problem. Unbelievable.
Two of the most whiny loud mouthed disgusting dishonest old lady bitches on the planet!
Democrats is so stupid! - Bugs Bunny
.@SenWarren .@HouseDemocrats Muster protesters from sea to shining sea. Demand #guncontrolplease #NoFlyNoBuy. America can be safer!
I love John Lewis. Thank you
Thank you for representing us!  We have a voice through you!
Just another distraction used 4 publicity. How about...I know, address the real problem. SMH
Unbelievable-y'all have found another way to obstruct results. Your behavior is appalling.
Pretending to be united is fooling no one.
Go get it done! Stop the killing!
WONT SOMEBODY THINK OF THE CHILDREN! 
Too funny....
Not funny, useless & obstructive. And they draw a salary. Ridiculous.
@mattymonsterz @HouseDemocrats I am dumbfounded  by most lawmakers, what's  it gonna take to reform things, disgusting.
i don't know but it needs to happen soon! We demand it
I don't wish/hope harm on anyone, but wth,what's it gonna take?To hit them personally. I already took it personally, 49 dead
same :/ it's just awful
awful and unacceptable. Thank God for those who are fighting for this cause.
@mjkarasch @HouseDemocrats Grandstanding nonsense. You're stomping your feet like two-year olds.
or boldly trying to affect affect change, however u want to look at it. They're sticking up for the will of the people.
Utter nonsense!  "The people" in that context means you and your anti-2A, anti-5A crowd.  It does not mean majority of Congress.
Is "utter nonsense" really necessary? And yes, I mean the people. The ones they represent.
Yes, it is appropriate. As an attorney you know the importance of all Const protections. But rewriting 2A and ignoring 5A?Shame!
Democrats are a disgrace to this country. I hope all your lies are exposed. You look like idiots on the floor.
Do you not realize you all look stupid? Nice of you to show all Americans they have crazies representing them!
Happy Birthday to my MA senator. I love your choice of celebration tonight
Don't quit! Now people are buying more guns fearing they will be taken away. If you fail you've made it worse!
You really don't understand the threat of terrorism.  Spinning gun control as the cause is just plain stupid.
keep up the good work!!!
Thank you so much for standing up for sensible gun laws. #holdthefloor #NoBillNoBreak
@HowieCarrShow oh, your donuts showed up magically between this pic and when you walked in? Lizdonut

@MoniquePressley @HouseDemocrats Bout time Dems showed back bone.
refreshing to see representatives actually operating with their constituents in mind rather than corporations!
STOP!! I heard they needed some more Jiffy Pop. #demsleepover
