You are my hero! Thank you for fighting the good fight for our Country, especially after what's happened today in Virginia. We need you.
Go ahead and stay there!!! You won't be missed!!!
Why are you not helping your constituents? Is this more money in your pocket?
Kind of like the 6 million it has cost Americans to guard liar on his trips to mara - Lago so far.
Why didn't U meet w/@kredmond_global & discuss US's #Atrocious treatment of 9M US expat population? .@MariaBartiromo 2nd Am Revol brewing.
stay there!
You're a natural diplomat, get comfortable because in 2020 you'll be doing this full time and cleaning up this current mess.
Great-just there.  You can be a big pain in the ass to Estonians.
And what was accomplished to make our lives better may I ask? Hope you enjoyed the taxpayer paid vacation.
Green and blue jackets in heavy rotation #piehole
You should have stayed in Estonia. I think they like Liars there. Did you see any There? I did, look.

Something tells me you didn't shove any of our allies out of your way.
Did  you do your Indian dance for them Pocahontas?  Liar !!!
We wish you would just stay there get the hell out of MA. Tell Estonia your Indian stories
That's great. But you guys in congress can't get anything accomplished except fighting.   If u were a business I would be bankrupt.
Don't come back!
Lizwarren- such a wonderful craze 
Liz warren- such a fake native phase
It means no presidency
For the rest of your dayssssss
Go there and stay there!  You are only wasting taxpayer money!
Get back to work! Stop waisting taxpayer money on fraudulent trips.
Representing the United States : we are so proud of you!
Glad to see you out there doing the things our so-called President should be doing!  I admire you!  I wish my NC senators were like you!
Liz, why did you go and screw with the folks of Estonia? You have to prove you uselessness to other country's?
Oh! I remember her!  She's the one that claimed to be Native American!  Another liar heard from!
Scary, Pocahontas is trying to be a diplomat....."Russia! She doesn't speak for me."
Rise of Another US War Hawk to Invade other Countries in this Evil Elizabeth Warren.
I hope this was on your $$$$
Did you ask them to pay up
Watch out or you may be investigated for no known reason.
You moonbat, you don't represent me..
Maybe you should have stayed there! You could be more effective then here at home! They would deport you for your  remarks against their gov
Please do us a favor. Stay over there. Maybe they can tolerate your lunacy better than we can. #VoteFakeNativeAmericansOut
Uh-oh, looks like the dems have a new bag man.
Do you understand what they tell you?
Stay there #fauxcahontas
Why the hell is a senator in a foreign country ???
They look positively thrilled.
Lordy Lordy still wearing those same black pants  blouse  and red or green jacket?  It must smell!!!! 
Someone has to do Presidential type relations. Represent US well, @SenWarren!
Why don't you stay.
More pics please!
Please stay there
What does it cost to send a senator and staff to Estonia? What about Oblama Care ? Why are senators not working what did you do 4 America??
Please help us
Omg you visited estonia collusion Warren is in cahoots with Estonia
Thank U Lizzy!!! U are the honest adult in the room
Goo has her out doing busy work! 
My mom is a proud Estonian-American--fled the Red army in 1944, arrived in the US in '52--immigrants, such an American story!
By any chance is NOKO your next stop Lizzy?..Oh please Lord let it be so.
must be nice to only have to work part time!
Seems like we could use the Center's experience!
RT @SenWarren: I spent time in Estonia this week meeting with top officials & visiting the NATO Cooperative Potato Defense Center o…
Looks like you forgot your headdress.
So yay or nay or missile defense system for Poland?
I'm sure they enjoyed having a liar visit them. #fakenativeamerican
Elizabeth Warren is what a President looks like!!  #2020
What? In Estonia working on cyber-defense? No golf??
But you came back.
So thanks for telling world where NATO cyber command is ? WTF
Thank you! Estonia is incredible & they can teach the US a lot about cyber security via-a-vis Russia.
You leave DC for a day and Trump goes after Kim. SMDH.
Excellent. Warren 2020. with maybe Bernie on the ticket. DNC will want it more "balanced" with someone in the centre... but anyway.
Two wrongs don't make a right so two unbalanced won't make a balanced either.
Thanks for visiting us! Hope you run in 2020 ;)
@ClaraJCarlson
Hope you didn't screw things up again. Perhaps you should stay home and remain quite.
Did you plant any listening devices?
they all think you suck. You're a fake Indian.
Just a hope: NATO needs to put more NATO troops in NATO bases in the Baltic states. If we are not there, Putin deems it up for grabs.
awesome!
we need reassurance, its important you're there.
Thank you for doing what 45 should be doing!

Hey Liz, can I come join you in Estonia? Don't really wanna be in the USA right now, this crazy cheeto is making me uncomfy. Thx bb girl.
Stop using that inaccurate and racist shit.
Come again, we have the most beautiful swamps :-)

So when are you going to spend some time with American constituents? Or do they not matter to you?
Republicans are the ones that don't want to hold town halls because they are afraid of their constituents
And I remind them of that as well. ANY Congressman, House or Senate, Dem or Rep, that FORGETS WHO PUT THEM IN OFFICE SHOULD GO!
WARREN 2020 I'm ready when u r!!!!
That would be scary!
Oh yeah for the republicans!!! Muhahhaa

Excellent. Thank you Senator Warren
