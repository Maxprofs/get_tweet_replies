@RNephewCGEP @realDonaldTrump No, let's pass a law on not destroying official emails.  Oh wait, we already have a law like that.
And lots of people have not followed it. @FredFleitz @SenWarren @RNephewCGEP @realDonaldTrump
#Trump destroyed emails against #CourtOrder!
Looks like the DNC is working overtime to distract from Hillary email scandal.
Trump campaign is working OT to distract from #TrumpTaxes #bribes #"charity" @FredFleitz @belskie @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
<- how small is your brain? Guess Hillary's Kool Aid  has taken effect @FredFleitz @belskie @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
Who the #Hell are you? A #TrumpTroll that thrives on #Hate? #GoAway @DeniseGabbard @FredFleitz @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
Thanks for the backup. Prob another Russian #trumptroll from #olinka. @belskie @thedominator939 @FredFleitz @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
@Nating3 @realDonaldTrump will that act include charitable foundations and email history?
No. Freedom of Privacy. Let him release them (or not) at his own expense. Stop messing with our Amendments.
The info released to the FEC provides more detail than any tax return.Let's see your returns or Hillary's emails & health records
She's not running, an Hillary has been way more transparent than serial #liarTrump. #TrumpTaxes @thedominator939 @SenWarren
We believe what we want to believe and we're all human. The decision s/b whose lies hurt America and whose don't.
SO U KNOW STD's R on the RISE, KEEP UR MOUTH SHUT TILL ALL CLEARS W/ U/OTHERS!  DICKING BIMBOS@HOME!
And Hildabeast deleted all those thousands of emails. Americans are to the point most don't care about taxes.
Unfortunately for us, new legislation effecting the current elections would amount to an ex post facto law 
Now @DonaldJTrumpJr is telling everyone that looking behind the curtain will be too much of a distraction.
.@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump, Could it be that  @DonaldJTrumpJr, is right & releasing the taxes would divert attention to the fraud?
so there isn't a law to this? Then get over it
GOP won't vote for this, but then we should write to each demanding WHY they vote against transparency.
How about transparency for ALL of Congress?! Health & $$–the crooked politicians would scatter like cockroaches.
How about passing the obama+clinton Act that forces them to show us the missing emails, yeah didn't think so.
meh. Let's have @HillaryClinton #releasethetranscripts as well
yes pl get it done.
what about medical records?
So naïve !  Do you really think a crooked business man would then run for Presidency.  How ridiculous !
hey Liz he emailed them to Hillary. Remember Nixon resigned for 18 min. Hillary deleted 33k lol. Great argument
@lheinkel lets pass the congress special interest $ transparency act.U have to pass it to see what's in it#MAGA
@jonpan54 @realDonaldTrump how about we pass a honesty in ethnicity Act? You lie like #Hillary
you were never transpafent about your ethnicity. Lieing comes naturally to the left.
WHAT ABOUT HILLARY'S HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND $$ SPEECHES OR CLINTON FOUNDATION ACCOUNT????
Or in the alternative let's just all vote for HRC.
We have to vote for @HillaryClinton only smart choice in this election. #StrongerTogether
Liz, show me your tax returns with your real estate gains. #Tatiana #US
she already has
Amazing proposal, Warren! :) We need transparency with taxes.

Amen!!

Say hello To President Donald Trump ! Thought u said it will never happen big mouth Warren. MAGA , go Trump !
You have no credibility until you go after @GregoryMeeks for his $998 Lexus monthly lease payment with taxpayer's money.
and you are a TOTAL TWO FACE
Chief Warren…… the IRS is in your pocket… Like you don't have them…… faux outrage
Where are the transcripts of @HillaryClinton's Wall Street speeches? Where are those?? Oh no one cares now, huh?
Maybe she'll release them when we see #TrumpTaxes. @LuluWalcott1 @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton
Doubt it.
Wall St. paid top $ 4 HRC speeches cuz prestige of having such an important woman speak 2 the firm.
@karindann @realDonaldTrump Every Presidential candidate must be transparent,  incl their taxes. It's too important a job
Ms Waren, Mr Trump IS transparent. He is a con man and he even has a Con-way running his campaign. Imagine that.
Yeah, because laws helped sort out the classified email mess.
Hillary hasn't released her emails. Emails r more important than taxes. Stop the audit then he can release taxes
ask Hillary to do the same about Paul Combetta and his Reddit post
key words..... Presidential Candidate
we need a presidential email transparency act too Pocahontas
RELEASE #Hillary speeches like Sanders repeatedly asked her to do. RELEASE #Hillary emails and make sure she comes clean.
#MAGA
I really want #Hillary to undergo a extensive mental health evaluation.
What with the blood clott in her brain
Arc of political civility since Elizabeth Warren came to the senate? Straight down! What a self serving cancer.
@EricIdle @realDonaldTrump legislation isn't the path to an informed electorate. #nolawneeded
@EricIdle @realDonaldTrump let's pass Presidential Medical Clearance Act and make sure she's clean #Pocahontas
@weezmgk Heck, @realDonaldTrump won't even do anything to prove he is actually being audited. Liar all the way.
@EricIdle @realDonaldTrump the trouble is, it won't be in time. Which is what the evil bastard wants.
@EricIdle @realDonaldTrump Sure. More legislation always works.... Or not.
I agree, I think the Presidential Tax Transparency act is a good idea.
Let's pass a bill so fake Indian lying political hacks cant use their office for political attacks #fauxahontas
You show a lack of integrity when tax releases #Trump Hillary's disqualifications.
Lets get some Goldman Sachs transcripts while we are at it
Independent physicals for all candidates

when Native American question you standing and fraud. Do you really think many care
RT@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump won't release his taxes! Let's pass the Presidential Tax Transparency Act and make sure he comes clean.
how about Hillary releases the deleted emails. Warren your wants wrong in Washington
Could you explain the Clinton Foundation and how that is all clean???????????
What America wants to see is a REAL audit of the Clinton Foundation.

@everbodyBlocksU @realDonaldTrump too little to late
DJT WAS A BUSINESS MAN, NOT A PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN LIKE CLINTON!
SHOULD HAVE PASSED THAT WHILE OBAMA WAS IN OFFICE! HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE WORD MEANS!
Could any court action in NY force the taxes out via evidence disclosure?
@deb3ms @realDonaldTrump Won't pass too many crooked Senate and House Members that might want to run for President.
How about cleaning up the country & stop with the partisan politics
Will the Senate pass this?  Or will the @GOP stone-wall as usual?
can I have a job? I have various skills and can relocate
Also, every nominee must undergo a physical by NIH to asses physical/mental fitness for duty. @menjicm @realDonaldTrump
Right On! @menjicm @realDonaldTrump
you Elizabeth are so wrong and so not in touch.
Seems, what with HRC's history of scandal and lies, Trump's taxes are the least of our concerns.
pointing fingers Eliz?
Come Clean on this you first class derrilick! Where u get all your money? STOLE FROM US!
Media & political class couldn't stop Trump b/c GIST of everything he says is true...little of what U say is
Why would he so you could try to demonize him....Trump'll be elected & new day for ALL Americans!
That's ridiculous and you know it. Try to stay in the real world to be effective.
@nytupelo7 PLEASE come clean. Do u support Oboma completing Congress Record 1963? @rockandledge @LorenceHud
only if Hilary does first.
@intenseCA @realDonaldTrump 
Health records for past 10 yrs too. Add that. W/teeth. Guarantee jail, not like NatlSec failures.
Should pass Act to prohibit corporate & Foundation campaign donations. Eliminate role of pseudo dukes & lords!
And in that "Transparency Act@ can we lost our authentic race?
how many times are you gonna say the samething boring.He could owe multi billions of dollars we would still vote@realDonaldTrump
Ok, how about the candidate DNA transparency act so we know if you're all that you say you are!
I wish someone could hack him to find his taxes
.@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump you won't pass Clinton Foundation Transparency Act & won't condemn Bill Clinton ending Glass-Steagal &meltdown
Retire please @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
- Then pass a Clinton transparency executive order!

#BRILLIANT!
Seven ways the Clinton Foundation failed to meet its transparency promises: http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/293507-seven-ways-the-clinton-foundation-failed-to-meet-its-transparency-promises …  Hyprocrisy?
Are you talking?
you won't pass Clinton Foundation Transparency Act, you won't condemn Bill Clinton ending Glass-Steagal/meltdown
can you also enforce the conflicts of interest among numerous congressmen and senators and all other federal employees!
taxes mean nothing. 4 dead innocent Americans, care to comment?
How about Hillary comes clean? http://www.kare11.com/mb/news/investigations/kare-11-investigates-unauthorized-charges-by-clinton-campaign/229158541 …
TRUMP LIED ABOUT AUDIT, AND NOW  WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT HIS  BUSINESS PRACTICES.
The  refusal to disclose his taxes is in itself  the vivid proof that Trump is hiding  compromising info.
look what happened to#ryanlockte
I really am frightened for the safety of#Hillary some one needs to evaluate @realDonaldTrump  mental status
@Republiicunts @realDonaldTrump great idea!
Great idea!!
.@SenWarren @lesliermyers @realDonaldTrump great idea ! At least for next time ! Health and tax returns shd not be optional .
Mental health history, too. I hope we can get #Trump's mental history.
It takes a lot of time for him to cover all his wrong doings up...
@sandraelleni @realDonaldTrump absolutely
But it's OK to skim $250M to get access to US gov't?  Hillary is a criminal and is no friend to women.
yes let's do that, where do I sign
What are the chances of that happening before 11/8? That's what I thought.
Let's pass a law about lying about your race.
Cos he's a big fat greedy cheating fraudster
this should have already happened
And shame on DT Junior for saying Americans are too stupid to understand their taxes.
Where were you when Obama refused to release his college transcripts? 

COWARD!!!
we don't need a law.  We need to force him.  Get after the media!
DO it NOW!!!
@universe2519 @realDonaldTrump if he continues to refuse, take his name off ballot. He shouldn't be allowed to run 4 POTUS
DT has been a private citizen, why should he
how about you start with cleaning up in your own house first and set the example?
.@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump WE LOVE YOU, SENATOR WARREN, but there's no way it would be retroactive, is there? We ALL need Hil' as #POTUS!!
@EverySavage I'm behind this 100 percent. Should be a law.We have to prove who went to vote!That's the least a Pres. Cand! Can do
We can't vote unless we present an id. Candidates need higher qualifications like tax records to run! Period!
Our with holding tax will pay him so we need to know
You can't decide to change the rules in the middle of an election year so work on your little rule for next term
That would be assuming there's anything 'Presidential' about him!
seriously no ones listening when you continue to endorse someone as corrupt as hillary #wronghorseLiz
ABSOLUTELY
@ErnestLamonica @realDonaldTrump ok Pocahontas
Comes clean. How? No acid that strong enough.
Will it only be 4 presidential candidates? f there is a clause for senators or congress to follow suit, it won't  pass.
Let's see how many @GOP are truly patriotic! I double dare ya!
now now now !!!!!
Need to pass new law: No destroying govt property by elected, aka smashing 13 blackberries/iPhones
DEFINITELY!! Trump is hiding something BIG in his taxes & health records, and I for one want to know what it is.
Imagine how #GOP would jump on #Hillary for not releasing her returns. #Trump operates under different rules.
you said it. To many loop wholes that he doesn't want anyone to see. Now who's the real crook
A bridge too far. 1. We have more important legislative needs. 2. Frivolous policy = bad policy. 3. What's next, medical records?
@Here_ISound_Off @realDonaldTrump kinda disagree.  it should be voluntary if running.  obviously he's hiding something
WAY TO GO..SENATOR WARREN!!!
yes, pass it odsy, must see returns before 8th This is not fair to the people, deplorables don't care but we do
Here Here , as a citizen I can't just say NO if asked about my taxes but billionaires who don't contribute 
lets pass a presidential lie detector test law, we all know Killary won't pass..she would blow up the machine.
Not another Government LAw, thank you.  The PARTIES should demand the returns as prerequisite to running.
@CathyWentzel @realDonaldTrump all fed employees should have to.
@myjojo122 comes clean?  From a democrat?  Bwahaha
@Marilunabeli @realDonaldTrump god plz help us donald trump can't be president he is crazy dangerous for United States
@Marilunabeli @realDonaldTrump yes donald trump no't release taxes because he no't pay tax he is lying false dangerous
nice try Fauxcahontas! Trump knows media will nitpick through 12,000 pages of return and spin. Trump polling big
let us see your tax returns so we could see how much wampum u have Pocahontas
How about a law 2 stop Any1 holding public office from accepting $/gifts even 4 charity cuz we know it's bribe $
Let him twist in the winds of people's speculation.
Lizzy, I'll bet if we looked into your history we could find all kinds of dishonest acts.
please do @realDonaldTrump is hiding something and the American people deserves to know
@TrumpToons @realDonaldTrump YES!!!
it is none of our fucking business!
We need to focus on enacting term limits for political hacks like you first
nobody is listening to you, still
let's do this! How can I help???? I hate Donald Trump. He calls Mexican-Americans 2nd & 3rd generation Mexicans!
Taxpayers deserve to know if Trump is one of them and what conflicts of interest he may have w their interests.
Please do!
Let's get that done!
If given choice of releasing taxes & dropping out of election, I bet he'd drop out.
I disagree on this tactic unless it applies to anyone running for federal office.
You can't do the Press' job in this manner.
release Hillarys MRI
Jon Miller & Jon Baron are doing his taxes   Meridith Mclever is double checking them 
Even the Most Naive of the Public at Large Realize You & Yours Are Full of #BULLSHIT @SenWarren~ Happy Landings @elflein1 @realDonaldTrump
#ChickenTrump
@elflein1 @realDonaldTrump How about making it the Presidential Truth & Transparency Act? Then he'd be royally screwed.
everyone should want this. If not,  suspect
lets just defeat Donald Trump and his deplorable ideas
Love your strength and intelligence Senator Warren. Thank you for your strong voice. @HillaryClinton @TheDemocrats @SenateDems
Yes, lets have some grown ups in the room not this

.@SenWarren 
Elizabeth Warren: Trump Is ‘Too Chicken’ To Release His Tax Returns

Call him a GIRLY MAN, He can't MAN UP on his Taxes-Taunt
There actually might be enough Republicans that would go along with that bill to pass it- #Ryanget2it
@BrettArends @realDonaldTrump Whatever you say Lieawatha.
excellent idea -  congress should act quickly
@CarolGo18658081 @realDonaldTrump - Great idea! #DThateslosingtoagirl
When is HRC going to release her transcripts from Goldman Sachs speeches?
@BrettArends @realDonaldTrump Go back to your reservation
@christine081579  Even his own rotten kid said it would be over for him & his campaign if he released them. He's a fraud.
@WYVeteran how are you going to pass it when the zika bill can't be passed?
@WYVeteran can you pass it this month??
Don't you dems own the IRS??
has been playing 4d chess while U play checkers over a year, u will be embarrassed... Just give up #Pocahontas
What about releasing ancestry, sound good Pocahontas?
@msbellows @realDonaldTrump Ryan said today he should. Does that mean the speaker is on board??????
how about we pass a balanced budget bill so you quit bankrupting my unborn grandchildren. Grow up Liz
