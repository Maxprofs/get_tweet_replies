If you had toned down the dishonest rhetoric in the campaign, you'd be meeting w him + not sending a letter.
Do think he will show leadership and make better choices?
Did you sign it "Sincerely, Pocahontas"?
Do you sign your letters white asshole? LOL it's a stereotype too!
I'm actually a fan. Just popped into my head, so I figured I'd tweet it
So glad. Although Stereotyping people leads to scapegoating and ignoring their rights.
But, we always need to retain our sense of humor.
Thank God you are NOT in charge. You, madam, did not win the Presidency.No one wants your opinion.
...nor did she seek it. Many people care about what Sen. Warren has to say-SHE was elected to the SENATE. How about you?
..Drumpf can't SPELL "transition."
@ArianeBellamar @realDonaldTrump America has rejected your world view.   Your letter will be lining a hamster cage
America overwhelmingly voted for Clinton. By almost 2 million votes
SHE LOST!!! GET OVER IT!!! GET SOME PLAY DOH OR SOMETHING!!!
Always insults. You learned from the best.
My daughter is gay..my brother in law's family is from Syria and Mexico. I tend to get defensive when ppl r bigot
Who the HELL is this Bigot you continually speak of? We ALL have gay friends, have minorities in the family. WTF?
You DemoNcrats are in the minority, we care NOT what you think. Thanks.
I bet this is what he & his team did when they read it -Pocahontas. If they even bothered to read it.  @realDonaldTrump
Tell the people how you got RICH after 2008. WARREN is a carpetbagger evil as hell
- Your party lost; shut up!
I bet you scared the begeezus out of him too.  Maybe if you were a nice person he might listen to you
As Pres Obama said, "elections have consequences ". You lost!!! #draintheswamp
@NikkiIalreadyno @realDonaldTrump The Gambian dictator president jammeh cut off the country from the international community
he won't read your letter. He is not listening to anything he does not want to hear. Example: Hamilton
i hope you wrote it in big block letters and kept the words short.
Liz, I am running the transition. #Tatiana
Perhaps you could explain the racists and insiders who're being brought in, then.
How about a letter to the president about standing rock?@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
Trump Kids getting clearance endangers his life and causes security risk for nation. THAT IS AN ISSUE
YES, AND I APOLOGIZE FOR MISREPORTING. HE DOES WANT KUSHNER TO BE CLEARED THOUGH ..

Hopefully he tore up your letter.
Pocahontas
None of your business, Ms. Warren. Don't you have something productive to do for your constituents?
ha I'm sure he'll take that into consideration  #DemsLost
it's in the trash...kinda like your party!
I am sure Trump cares what you have to say.
You seem to be a bitter, hateful person who is very closed minded!
You think Trump gives a Crap what you think or say? That letter went straight into the porcelain receptacle!
AT LEAST HE DOESN'T HAVE FAKE INDIANS IN HIS CABINET
I'm sure he will take your letter into consideration
and if he is the intelligent FREE thinking man I believe he is, I hope he put it where it belongs, in the trash!
Can almost guarantee you, any advice from YOU will fall on deaf ears. He has no respect for you. I know why.
I'm hoping he wiped his ass with it
Lizzy, I hope Sessions is going after HRC, and you too, if you broke any laws!
@iJesseWilliams @realDonaldTrump #ACCOUNTABILITY
HUH?  Did you complain about Obama's Muslim insiders?
Um, I'm sure he gave your letter and your concerns the proper consideration
Will somebody on his staff please read @SenWarren 's letter to @realDonaldTrump ? I suspect he's functionally illiterate but won't admit it.
Senator Warren please stay on top of these people they are devious, underhanded and crooked. Trump lies every time his lips move!
@citizengatsby @realDonaldTrump What about an audit of the election? Are we going to allow Putin's interference to stand?
When you become President of the United States you can pick your own transition team. Don't sound like a sore loser Ms. Warren.
Clean your own house first, lady, before you start shooting your mouth off! You ran ultimate insider HRC $$$,$$$
they purged the lobbyists but I'm sure Pocahontas will find something else negative to tweet about

LAUGHABLE straight to the round file 
Yet, you campaigned for Hillary #Pay4Play corruption, collusion, & serial perjurer. Just stop trying to act
lol lol the just signed a law that protesters are terrorist lol they are about to kill yall...set upppppp
I'm more concerned about you lying about your heritage to get monies meant for someone else.  Lying scum
How many letters have you sent to Hillary about her exposing classified info and about her influence peddling?
So, no one cares what you think. We won. @realDonaldTrump
The letter is probably tucked safely away in the circular file.
Frankly My Dear It's Noneya'!
I love it @SenWarren "I will oppose you, for the next four years"! YES!
@iJesseWilliams @realDonaldTrump Aww Did you use he's best words? Cuz otherwise it would be useless.
@iJesseWilliams @realDonaldTrump Shut up, you evil, stupid bitch.
Please,his team is exemplary for limiting lobbyists and Washington insiders. Nice try to hit him on a strength.
Excellent letter from a good woman to an evil fool.More power to her.
why because your gal pal Hillary lost and you're not on the team. Hurry to your meeting with Soros!!!
I'm sure he'll jump to appease you when he reads your warped thoughts
Y r u not productive? We no u'll never support. Hope he's filing ur letters where they belong -in big trash can!
what's new! Didn't hear this when OBAMA selected some nasty folks! You need to let someone young take your place
good for you. at least he didnt run for presidency on all THEIR money like clinton
Warren if you dont like Trump; why isn't there legislation being introduced to reign in the imperial presidency?
President Obama intentionally omitted whites/Christians from his "hires" list. You never opposed. Shush now.
well Senator Warren is right in there with George Soros so she's part of the problem
you are amazing and I know that you will watch out for us
Awesome to hear you will be supporting all those that djtRUMP conned into believing he was working for them.
Hopefully he tossed it right into the trash. @realDonaldTrump
hey Pocahontas why did you meet with Soros? Need a loan on that $5.4 million Tee Pee you stole from taxs payers
For all our sakes, I hope he reads it. Thank you @SenWarren! Listen up @realDonaldTrump, take notes.
probably ended up in the trash where it belongs
How's George?
Oh, shut up! They r not!
.   Aren't you the pot calling the kettle black.  #CorruptDNC.  #CorruptDems
That's awesome, Senator. How inclusive of you! Shouldn't you be rioting somewhere? Way to set a positive tone!!!
You're part of the swamp U won't have time to dog anyone else U have been proven to lie to get college tuition as Native American
My favorite part! #Warren2020 @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
butt out Sitting  your side lost so SFU President Trump damn good businessman set his administration his way
You are an exceptional politician and I am so grateful for the work you do. Thank you for putting these issues out there <3
Thank you, @SenWarren. You are the voice for those who would shout from roof tops about what we expect from our president.
P.S. Who do you think you are?You were elected in one state, Trump elected by the nation. Dems were repudiated.
you are a George Soros puppet
get back on your meds asap
congrats on getting @realDonaldTrump to act. Best of luck with CFPB next! #Keepupthegoodfight
Thanks for your fictitious concerns ... However, President Trump is keeping us updated with the TRUTH via TWEET
Thank you, @SenWarren. Keep fighting for us!
did you send that same letter to Obama. Get real
too bad no one gives a  what you think!
My advice, next time simply provide the list of people you feel should be considered part of Trump's transition team.
Are women peacefully protesting in January? Where can I get info? Thank you!
Not to mention the children who seem to think they shd have security clearance. Seriously? #nepotism #trumpkids
it's false idiots see y believe the media
the dream team..in hell' haha we are becoming a version of Germany 1935 we need u go kick ass warren!

CLOWN STATEMENT BRO..HITLER WAS EVIL BUT SMART,,MILITARY GENIUS YOUR MAN IS STUPID AND OBTUSE
Cool @SenWarren. @realDonaldTrump  can Christen the @WhiteHouse fireplace with it.

#DrainTheSwamp 
#ThankYouObama
.@OverOnTheRight @SenWarren He'll smoke the peace pipe with Pocahontas -  Oh forgot, he doesn't smoke.  Tough luck Warren.
.@BarrieNJ 
Just showmanship by underperforming/overpaid @SenWarren who is trying to "unite" more bedwetters.  She's irrelevant.
It appears the Democrats might be feeling the same about Gulfstream Botox Pelosi too.
Pelosi has injected so much botox it's affected her speech. 
@BarrieNJ @SenWarren
Heard Pelosi jumped  off the Golden Gate on election night but survived.  Apparently s**t and Botox float.
Pelosi is like Weekend At Bernies on Botox.
How could the people of Massachusetts  possibly elect someone as hypocritical as you. Hope they wake up
@DrDinD @realDonaldTrump I'm guessing the letter went straight 2 shredder before it was opened. Unless, return addy was D. DUKE
who cares what u did Senator?
Americans calling for Warren's resignation as she displays unstable behavior following Trump's election.
WTF?! Since when does the U.S. President exploit the highest office in the land for his own profit? STOP HIM!
Thank you Senator Warren!
did you send a letter to the DNC about stealing the nomination from Bernie? I think not. We will vote u out.
Big Chief Warren speakum words on values, stole minority reserved faculty job away from real Indian
@GeorgiaDemocrat @realDonaldTrump He can't read!
We've had Democrat insiders for 8 years! What's your beef about people's choice?
I dont prefer the insiders Clinton was going to choose. Bet you would not have bothered with a letter then huh?
Lead those vigilant watchdogs!
@ZephyrTeachout @realDonaldTrump How did you feel about the insiders who were going to run Hillary's transition team?
I know that you care Senator, but just let them bicker. they're meeting our expectations. Trump's a failure.
her passion is stop WallStreet Insiders from ever taking Avg.Americans over t/cliff again & she sees them gathering.
Relax Fauxcohontas, @realDonaldTrump doesn't need your advice.
Save your concerns!  YOUR NASTY WOMAN LOST!  MYOB!
We caught you #elizabethwarren conspiring with riot starter #GeorgeSoros !
http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/democrats-soros-trump-231313 …
thank you for speaking out in your letter denouncing Trump's  transition team. We need you now more than ever!
Warren just spent 3 days with Soros, & she wants ppl to take her serious? Put a pin on and go to ur cry room
#thankyouforstandingup
Thank u for saying something. Sounds like @ChrisChristie did this and @mike_pence  fixing  http://m.townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2016/11/16/pence-drops-lobbyists-from-trump-transition-team-n2246638 … #draintheswamp
You lost two blue wall Big Labor states that means you lost union bosses to Trump. You will likely do so again.
and outside of NY and San Francisco your opinions on his cabinet are meaningless.
being more shrill and finger wagging after you pissed off working class America isn't a good 2020 strategy.
you need to worry about your own party's complete lack of national presence and WHY that's your reality now.
Arrogance doesn't listen or care. Welcome to the new USA government agenda: It's every man for himself.
Well written letter.  It's been a week Senator.  Trump is not even in office.  And you've already started with threats. #awful
Thanks so much for helping us.  Seems like we all registered for a nation-wide Trump University.
shut up and enjoy the ride
Thanks, Pocahontas.
Warren you little Soros puppet.
I'm sure he threw your letter in the circular file where it belongs.
Psst.. Nobody cares what you think.
Get over it cuckoo 
This letter has too many words and facts for DJT to comprehend
I love  u Senator
good for you
Thank you, Senator Warren!! I hope more follow in your footsteps. There are so many things that need looking into.
@unbreakablepenn @realDonaldTrump Mr Trump appoints insider GOP elites to his WH team.  Fooling the voters
I love you.
Ignore the haters. I'm one of your constituents and I love you did this. Keep fighting!
Ms. Warren, many of us are with you and terribly grateful that you are taking this stance. Stay on him!
you don't need to worry about it! You back a loser,
@pameladubsky49 @realDonaldTrump Letters r a joke&no one will readACT NOW 2 STOP HIM BY CALLING NATIONAL SECURITY CRISIS. NOW
AGREED!!!!!!
This sick joke has gone beyond funny.We're in manic hysteria
With all do respect, @SenWarren, but I care far more about the actual nazi as Chief Strategist than insiders on his transition team.
HEY Lizzie! Nothing you say or do is going to matter! As long as WE APPROVE! WE THE PEOPLE! OUR TURN! R PRES!
Who cares about your concerns. You lost your butt!
You have a lot of nerve complaining about "insiders" while living in a 5 MILLION dollar home.
#insiders #danger
looking a little pathetic here Lizzie.  @realDonaldTrump won ~ let it go. You can make a team when YOU win. K? #PresidentTrump
HOW WAS YOUR CLOSED DOOR MEETING WITH SOROS?? #BigDonor #SorosOwnsYou
Senater, isn't there something that can be done legally????
Kudos to Elizabeth Warren! Champion of ordinary Americans.
You think he will listen to you when he's working on a team that runs circles around Obama's lying corrupt term
It's not your team or your party or your White House.. We had to put up with Jarrett.. Rhodes.. criminal Clinton
love this. not sure he can read tho
I'm sure he will jump right on your concerns.  You and Sanders are the frauds.
you have no power anymore,your socialist agenda will never make it,thank God for Trump
Actually, it's really none of your business. He'll build a great team and he,not you,will care about our people!
Thank you for everything you do, from a proud Holyoke resident!
No one cares what you think. Trump is our Pres. Elect. Accept it gracefully and help our country and our people!
Did @georgesoros help you write the letter, you sellout?
go home.
I'm sure he will take your "letter" under consideration....right after you realize YOU LOST the ELECTION.....
He does not give a rat's ass about concerns, people, or the law.  @realDonaldTrump
Wow, a letter.
