We don't need gun control, we need terrorist control, but cowardly Dems won't admit it
What ideology did Roof follow that we could have profiled? Radical Islam?
Nazi Party, White Supremacist, Militia, Confederate Flag carrying
Most you mentioned already profiled by feds. Check DHS reports. Why Not Islam?
Profile Islam as well if threat is known, under FBI investigat 10 yrs
No assault weapon purchase under FBI investig. for 10 years.
Due Process. We need to protect it at all costs. It's the foundation of liberty
, thank you for all your acts of mindful courage. America sees you. #NoBillNoBreak 
@repjohnlewis is a hero. @SpeakerRyan...isn't.
Stripping people of their rights without due process is heroic? Progs are strange animals.
Feel free to join a well-regulated militia. That's your 2nd Amndmnt right. Go on, now.
@SenWarren @repjohnlewis @SpeakerRyan
"The right of the people, to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
That's the 2nd.
After..."A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State..." @SenWarren @repjohnlewis @SpeakerRyan
"because this is necessary, these rights, of the people, shall not be infringed" #defenddueprocess
Agreed. Where's my right to a well-regulated group of gunfondlers? #TeamRampantManslaughter. @DavidSchulte1 @repjohnlewis
#yawn #whocares you progressives are leaders at cutting off people's free speech
Bullshit... show us ONE example. Censorship is the domain of fascists.   @SenWarren @repjohnlewis @SpeakerRyan #holdthefloor
Pelosi shut the cameras off when the GOP was holding the floor in 2008. It was wrong then and it is wrong now.
That was for aa few minutes and the gallery wasn't cleared.http://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-now/2008/08/house-dems-turn-out-the-lights-but-gop-keeps-talking-010724 … @newsguy2005
@politico That's fair, I just want the cameras back on. Neither side should be able to shut out the people.
I want outrage from the left when Dems do it. That has and never will happen.
I agree. We all need to stop judging  action only by the R or the D in front of the name.
So please direct your even-handedness to @SenWarren and her ilk. TIA!
As Hillary says "Whats the difference". You all Blocked out Bernie supporters.
takes a person like you to tear up the constitution
In accordance with the rules of body, when no official business is being conducted the cameras were shut off. Sit-in not official
shameful is you stealing Native identity.
Yeah...well elections have consequences. Besides, you're in the senate.
You are shameful
Don't like Liz in a house don't like Liz with a mouse Don't like Liz here there or anywhere.
go away
this is the kind of finger pointing people are SICK and TIRED OF!l and why Sanders had the following
Um According to rules of body. If not in session cameras are turned off. As a Rep, U should know this @SenWarren
.@SenWarren @repjohnlewis @SpeakerRyan 
I'll help!
MASS MUST VOTE OUT THIS #FRAUDAHONTAS #PRINCESS-LIE-A-WATHA FROM DESTROYING WHATS LEFT OF THIS COUNTRY
Hero?  Lady, you work for the people.  Get back to work!
used to be a hero. he used to risk his life. before he joined the circus.shoulda juggled the donuts...
When are you lawmakers giving up your guns?
Shameful that Goofey Elizabeth Warren is blaming guns for acts of radical Islamic terrorism
Ryan was Right to shut them off  YOU libtards need to Follow the Rules
Ryan is saving tax payer money while you all sit and do nothing...   there are laws ya know!
Cause he knows we don't wanna see yr hypocritical asses!
@PFossil @repjohnlewis @SpeakerRyan Get this poisonous woman offmy radar!
What do you know about shame? Jeep has more Cherokee than you do #shutuppocahontas
No Ma'am, Your LIES to the American people is what is shameful. No shame, no moral compass.
WRONG Ryan shut off camera SO America wouldn't SEE how pathetic senators ARE TRUMP PRESIDENT November
Idiot.
Hero???  I guess we have a different definition of a hero #demclueless
yeah I guess it was ok when Palosi did the same thing in 2008. I'm not GOP but be fair.
except the rules state they go off if biz can't be conducted. #LIAR #termlimitsnow
Banning people from a "list" devalues our Constitution. This could have the potential to destroy due process.
lmao...idiots...who wants to watch a bunch of fat old dems sit on their ass ! Thanks Ryan
shame on @speakerRyan shame on republicans and the dirty NRA.  Good luck
and what year was that written in?  Wake up America
Shutting off the cameras was Stalinesque.  Staging a sit-in to rebrand E.W + J.L.? #DemPandering
Not surprising that Senator Warren lied about U turning off lights. Again speaks with forked tongue.
so you're criticizing the same thing Dems did in 2008 over energy policy?  Cutting cameras? x2standard
- wrong if you could quit lying than you would know the cameras Broadcast  for actual business only.
Is lying an inherent behavior you willfully display consistently?  @repjohnlewis @SpeakerRyan
I shut off the camera to him and his legacy when he endorsed #CrookedHillary
This is a time for @SpeakerRyan to set himself apart from the business as usual crowd. Epic fail #NoBillNoBreak 
- Reid did this all the time when he was speaker!! Taking away "due process" is unconstitutional.
Do you think we can't see through this planned diversion in the day of Trump's speech? HRC #Bloodmoney
Hey Sen Warren..why dont you learn to tell the truth..but bein a Sen.guess you dont know House rules
Mrs. Warren you should be more knowledgeable of the rules/just a politician lying to feed purpose.
Elizabeth - you are an idiot. There are rules - and they were being followed. NOTHING to do with them
Lying warren and lying lewis
Wrong Chief. Rules of body state that cameras be off when no official business conducted.Tantrums aren't official.
Lying as usual. The house rules shut the cameras off when there not any business being conducted.
Back in '08 Pelosi did the same thing - Hard pill 2 swallow 4 U dems. No official biz, no cameras.
its shut off because Congress is not in session i could careless about gun laws
much like your party leader you throw a tantrum when things don't go your way and parade your victories in the people's faces
how about the bills you turned down because your party didn't author them.
just following the rules unlike what dems like to do.
shameful is your lies and they never stop. Congress in recess equals no cameras. Death=Politicizing
Can't even honest about House rules Lizzy. A shame you're a serial liar.
warren, shameful is you who doesn't understand house rules. No business done, cameras shut off. Rules
Pelosi did the same thing in 2008. Learn the rules of the House.
@AZGrobie @repjohnlewis @SpeakerRyan there is a seperation of powers for a reason. #childsplay
No one wants to watch you make a fool of yourself.
@JRL2018 @repjohnlewis @SpeakerRyan Just like Pelosi shut off cameras in 08?  Bet you didn't complain then.  Politicians..SMH
So the House RULES don't apply to  everyone?  If you don't get your way legally, pout about it?
Mr @SpeakerRyan did not turn off the cameras. Gets your facts right before tweeting.
demonrats R like communists they need to get fired they do not support or defend the Constitution!
i am accustomed to Dem impotence, but wallowing in a public display is new low - disgusted former Dem
This is shameful, SenWarren. They should be ashamed of themselves wanting to strip rights away from US Citizens
Thanks for trying to take my rights away...NOT!
Uh no, the sit in is shameful.  Grow up.
#Libs do anything to take minds off ISIS.  Quit worrying bout guns... just give terrorist a hug!
When will you stop trying to force upon the American People what they don't want? #crybabies
The only publicity stunt being pulled is the worthless Republicans who refuse to pass Gun Law Bills that would protect Americans
Except this. http://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-now/2008/08/house-dems-turn-out-the-lights-but-gop-keeps-talking-010724#ixzz4CLWfpAaP …
almost as shameful as your failure to get behind @BernieSanders
Meanwhile men with guns protect @repjohnlewis and other democratic protesters
I seem to remember the democrats doing that and worse a few years ago...
thank you @repjohnlewis and @SenWarren from one of your fiercest supporters.
IMO you all acted like little kids throwing a tantrum
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJ5B4RRicag … Whistle blower Dems do not care, This will piss off the masses
was it shameful when @NancyPelosi shut off the lights & cameras on Republicans in '08
Ms Warren, get a real job ! Do something productive for America.

Heroes don't behave like children when adults tell them they can't violate their Constitutional oath. @repjohnlewis @SpeakerRyan

ha. You guys are out of order. You're lucky capitol police have not hauled you off.
when you control congress, you can do as you like. You don't now, so sit down and shut up.
The Dems may need an orthopedic surgeon considering how much they're patting themselves on the back over a tantrum.
