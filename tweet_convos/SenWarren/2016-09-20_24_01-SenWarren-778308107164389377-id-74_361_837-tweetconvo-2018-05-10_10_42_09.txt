And Wells Fargo is one of @HillaryClinton 's biggest donors... She'll take money from ANYONE. #JusticeForJuanita
@lheinkel & u will retire a multi millionaire while only making a salary of $174,000. How does that work?#PJNET #MAGA
she was probably ruthless! She's no banker!
Bank execs exempt from prosecution. Bet she is a Republican
â€œCarrie Tolstedt has been one of our most valuable Wells Fargo leaders, .....a champion for our customers"  - CEO
@Twin1222 @WellsFargo - this is reason to fire with cause.  No remuneration necessary.  Please people -  WAKE the hell up.
Just doesn't seem right,  right?

...nor Just!  Agreed?

BTW @SenWarren  What's "RIGHT" or "JUST" with #fanniegate
It's sickening.
@SenateBanking @WellsFargo Ask him if the rumors are true that Hillary campaign is charging poor seniors credit cards multiple x
.@SenWarren @WellsFargo  #CLAWBACKTOLSTEDT
@tayari @WellsFargo what about jail time?
lucky her
If it was such an innocent retirement, why didn't they accelerate her un-vested comp?  Maybe because it would look bad?
Just like you. You'll retire with a huge payout as well. Can I get my share back? At least bank users get to switch.
Get these Banksters... Amazing Job!
Dems know about Hilary's Crimes and still support her?
Probably because she was smart enough to make sure she's got incriminating evidence on those above her.
Yes, she gets a $120M payout for presiding over fraudulent/criminal activity. Sums up our corrupt corporate world!
they are all in the club together.  No ethics. No empathy. No patriotism.  Just greed.
No justice!  A systemic problem, perpetrated by those at the top, stealing from their customers and making millions.
Not if you guys put her in jail she won't.
Twitter needs a "that sucks" reaction button!
that crap has to stop. Do wrong and get a big pay out. Wtf
@realDonaldTrump  Lizzy question Hillary who dropped you,  we can get an indictment and you can visit her in Prison.
she needs the $125 million to help feed her kids (key in sarcastic music.)
what an impressive speech as I watched on cnn. Makes better leaders.
@JonBowzerBauman @WellsFargo I find it deplorable the WF execs cook up a scheme the emps  get fired and the execs get goldchute
Dear @SenWarren,  Please see that @WellsFargo, and all other huge corporations destroying America, pay trillions in retribution.
Sen Warren how can the little people get behind you to end this bs in the financial systems? #imsickofthem
We know you lied about your race and are still teaching...
Just like you will when you retire. Living off of the back of USA workers. Cultural appropriator!
Sounds like fraud charges should be leveled.
Thank you for standing up for US Sen Warren!
like Roger Ailes.  Banks and media....
: NO! This is wrong! #wellsfargoScandal #WellFargoStinks @Ask_WellsFargo
Put His Ass In Jail And Take the Money Back
this attitude is not uncommon. let's change the game or we'll all keep paying when they get caught #2big
She knows too much to leave her hanging. Paying her to keep her mouth shut! You need to subpoena her with immunity.
and @HillaryClinton is still running for president! y are u not "TEARING INTO HER" Ur a joke!
How Can You Pull For Hillary? She's Big Business Pay to Play and Hates @Uber & @Airbnb! Hillary Hates a Sharing Econ!
If you and me go rob a bank we go straight to jail, the other way around they get rewarded.
how to hold institutions to the fire when they carry great leverage & free cash? Limited investment instruments for avg American
Boycott All Big Business! Buy Local & Barter!
Currently in the process of leaving Wells Fargo for a local credit union.  Customer loss will show them.
where was the DNC held this year?
What does some arena's naming rights have to do with price of tea in China, pray tell.
just funny she didn't have an issue with it being held at the Wells Fargo arena, but then again she hates big banks and suppers HC
What about those companies which give their ceo's a hefty retirement package and not their workers when bankrupted
Funny u calling her out career politicians like you do the same thing lie cheat get rich in office retire w/benefits
You are poster child for people who vote against their own self interest time after time.
#arrest them Fucken crooks #toomuchtalk
I appreciate the work of the @CFPB but it seems powerless to punish offenders. Frustrating.
Great job exposing CEO/Chairman Stumpf's refusal to own any of this. He takes his orders from the Board???
Looks like the "Pocahontas" name calling crowd approves of Wells Fargo screwing consumers. Very Trumpian.
Support Elizabeth to put more #Feet2theFire #VOTE
.. @WellsFargo = Corporate_Thieves .. Jail Those Responsible .. No Bonuses for Criminal Activity .. They've Done This Before ..
nothing different than government officials they take the country for everything they can n walk off great benefits
Payout is outrGe
Capitalism at it's finest !
. How do you talk about high tuitions after making 350k/ year to teach ONE class at Harvard ?
Bet you aren't so fauxtraged by Trump University stealing people's money. Probably full of excuses for him
As George Carlin said "It's a big club and we poor folk ain't in it"
You know the solution to the problem, deregulation....
Great job today!  Thanks for fighting for the people!
