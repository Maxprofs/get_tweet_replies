happy birthday.. #wellregulated like banks need to be..
"No State shall...emit Bills of Credit" ART I, SEC 10, CL1, which was a term of art for paper money.
regulated meant equipped and stocked. Not for govt to impede. Not regulate like banks.
No, regulated means disciplined, accountable to public office authority.
not govt oversight and control. But individual protection from all tyranny.
There's no "individual", "single" or "one" in the 2nd Admnt. Says "the People"
yes the people. Not a national guard. An armed populace. The people.
So you disregard the Articles of confederation the 13 original colonies agree upon in your analysis?
Proud to share my birthday with @SenWarren
wait one second! Today is your birthday?!? Sonya!! Happy birthday! I owe you a cupcake!
that cupcake place is DANGEROUS!
Happy Birthday, Sonya! I even went to James & the Giant Cupcake to pick up treats for my client today (but I ate yours).
I got a cupcake - snickerdoodle SO GOOD!
Assault weapons ban.
you mean scary ergonomic features ban.  Pistol grips, mags, collapsible stock.
8 bullets/second.
if you have a fast finger. Only 500k American collectors can legally own automatic.
noooo, they cannot. Learn of what you speak. READ THE  FEDERALIST PAPER'S
No one wants to be "controlled"; everyone wants to be safe. #GunSafety
not true progressives.
Thank you so much - thank you for your dedication to us!!! Go @HillaryClinton
WAY TO GO GIRL
@johnlegend Wendy Williams

John Lewis was on no fly list.Makes him a TERRORIST per U.  No guns/NO VOTES. Remove terrorist from office
go back to your wigwam
@rezeski @repjohnlewis 2nd
I demand for @HillaryClinton get her Corrupt $300K per Hour as on Twitter NOW! I demand debates on HER Speeches! -T
She was a civilian & entitled to earn what she feels her talents/skillsets are worth.
Ask George W Bush & Dick Cheney.
@RobertSchwartz_ @repjohnlewis Which of our constitutional rights,for which so many Americans have died, Will you oppose next? f
What year do you live in? There’s not one constitutional right that does not come w/common sense rules & amendments in time.
I agree, Robert. However, as a former gun enthusiast, neither I nor anyone I know has ever harmed anyone with a firearm.
#GunControl or further Wage on #War? #Unconstitutional #RacialProfiling #NoFlyList
@ Yea that's because you get paid well & don't do Anything !
Nothing like revoking Constitutional rights to get a Leftist Democrat to wet her pants.  @SenWarren @repjohnlewis
the 2nd Amendment ONLY gives a " well trained & regulated MILITIA" the Rights to bear arms. NOT CITIZENS
- The only gun control should be that doctors who work with mental patients should tell ATF - "No Permit for J Doe"
why gun control how about crime control
In order to control guns, you have to control people. Control them with a Stalin-esque approach. Appears to be your goal.
Stealthy humblebrag.
cunt
Right where u belong with the trash!
didn't they tell you your a mistake hospital switch babies your parents were RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS
Elizabeth for vp!!
Squaw speak with forked tongue.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!

Happy Birthday!!!
@ReadShould @repjohnlewis
 Yes. That made a great impression, and changed a lot of things
Trump can claim "America First" when he brings Trump Collection jobs from China &Mexico for Americans
He can claim it now.
It's his platform.
I claim it on his behalf.
America First!

#ImWithYou
@babysgramma @SenWarren @repjohnlewis
Oh wow I'm convinced now
Not trying to convince you; I already knew there was no hope. I was here for the entertainment value.
@SenWarren @repjohnlewis
Have a license for your bow and arrow, #Pocahontas?
@dooce @repjohnlewis
really?  you wouldn't rather spend it in your teepee counting your wampum????
Why didn't you do this when they first started blocking POTUS Obama? @SenWarren @repjohnlewis
OMG girl, you and Hilly would make such a devastating "one-two punch"!
.@SenWarren Happy Birthday!  When I acted like a 2 year old, my mom told me to blow out my candles and take a nap.
@SenWarren @repjohnlewis
June 23/16 will godown in Britiain as Independence Day!People blamedBHO for condescending speech to British people!

chicago is awash in murder every week ..why dont you do something abt that instead of grandstanding
shut up lady.. why don't you support @SenSanders if want real change
Then STAY there. And you turned, what, 150, not to mention my stomach? But no Bdays necessary for you to do that.
,Happy Belated Birthday Elizabeth. I unfortunetly did not get chosen as a Neb Delegate 2 Nat'l Con this past wkend.

@ManMet80 @repjohnlewis What an inspiring 24 hours.  Thank you for speaking and sitting for America.  Happy Bday Sen Warren!
Goofy Elizabeth!
Really? Nowhere else?
happy bday Senator ! Proud to have u as our Senator please keep it up!

Embarrassing
Fauxcahontas, you may now return to the reservation!
Yall should've made makeshift wigwams and did a rain dance
remember your "heritage"!      http://freedomoutpost.com/what-happened-when-the-us-government-confiscated-guns-for-safety-protection-in-the-past/ …
@nero She is so #trite.
This disgraceful display by the dems makes you all look like spoiled, special needs children.
no class
You all are a bunch of children.
wait a minute this might be your first accomplishment oops sorry my bad just @TheDemocrats sitting on their Asses #Protect2A @NRA
You lost, there is and won't be a bill. Stop pissing away my tax dollars.
native American not so much. #credibilitylost #LaureateEducation #IAmWithYou
or a casino...
#SmokeSignals would hv been more interesting #DemocraticSitIn #tcot
get the vacuum... Time to sweep up the dirt from the floor.
You continue to be utterly ineffective and throughly disingenuous but for the gullible who wants lies you do well.
And for you Pocahontas, you didn't do anything, so definitely one of your most productive
Senator Fork Tongue heap big traitor.
you sure you wouldn't rather scalping white men?
that's breaking the law, but since when did laws mean anything to the Democraps?
You are both the biggest self serving jokers in government.
pocahontas
get a life
1/16 Native American my ass
wish you old washed up hippies would just go away.
Why didn't you pass the Republican plan? Also, why did you claim to be Native American to get free money? Thanks
Holding your breath until you turned blue might have been more effective, and would've made better TV.
Why do you hate civil rights?
how would no fly no buy prevent someone that was removed from the list after FBI investigation + job background and nice check
You don't seem to like due process. Why are you there anyway?
leave up to the F-tards to blame Radical Islam on guns! Go figure
you use the murder of 49 people as a publicity stunt sit-in & a platform to raise money for your party.Disgraceful
Thanks for fighting to take away my right of due Process. You must be so proud.
So much for your hashtag. Quitters.
Will happily send cake to you both. Thanks for your dedication!
Thank you for doing your job. May you have a happy belated celebration with loved ones. @DeniseFlores @repjohnlewis
Nowhere I'd rather you spend your special day than there either!
@johnlegend @repjohnlewis Yes something must be done.
@johnlegend @repjohnlewis Typical day for Demonazis - sitting on their butts doing nothing but photo ops.

#NoBillNoBreak
@re

Not impressed
Happy Birthday 
Happy Birthday and THANK YOU!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SENATOR WARREN!
#NoBillNoBreak Sen Ryan called this a publicity stunt. 'Bout time Republicans listen to the public not the NRA.
Happy Birthday Warren and thank you ALL for sticking up for us @SenWarren @repjohnlewis #USA
If @TheDemocrats cared about gun violence they'd have a #sitin on the streets of South Chicago....
@johnlegend  Dem/hillary party is owned by Mid east Countries&Banks contribute to her fund&U can also get a piece
=Hope
Thank you for standing up for standing up and sitting in! It renews my hope in the democratic process, so proud!
@johnlegend @repjohnlewis @SenWarren time to Escape the PLANtation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb8Rj5xkDPk … d};-}}
you people need to get it together. Stop with your thoughts and prayers. DO YOUR JOBS. pass better gun laws
@johnlegend @repjohnlewis
@johnlegend @repjohnlewis #goodtrouble
happy bday Liz. Plz adopt me and be my mom.
you guys are geniois for being able to come up with such a great bill in such a short time. Why now & not before?
@donnabrazile @repjohnlewis  and glad to be above ground. Praise the Lord!
#greattrouble. Thank you! Happy Solar Return Continue the fight Act in Love!
Ooooh, you two are creating chaos. How sweet it is.  Thank you so much for fighting for us. Love it.
Why does @SenWarren  want to infringe on our rights, but doesn't mind terrorists walking freely in society? Votes?
Happy belated birthday! Trying to find out who was manning down the phones/cameras on periscope?
so representative of congress, sitting around getting nothing accomplished
@Pie_SocialMedia Happy Birthday from a fellow 6/22'er.  Keep fighting the good fight, it is appreciated
We support your heroic efforts 100% ,and thank you for caring !!!VOTE BLUE!!
@jimmy_dore Where were you when Bernie needed you?!?
Thank you for your support!!! So proud to be a Democrat !!
@trevor_neilson @repjohnlewis More libs giving up liberties. Restricting law abiding citizens to stop criminals...what a shame!
Dave and Busters is fun, too
I wish politicians would do this for getting big money out of elections.  #EndCitizensUnited #Wolfpac #NeverHill
#NeverTrump
happy birthday @SenWarren and thank you for all your doing on the floor today
@raerie @repjohnlewis it's okay.....its just tax dollars being wasted....sit on ass and bills won't pass
bills. Not one. Four. If it takes a protest to get everyone back in to do their jobs and work together, I saw go for it.
the four "laws" are not good laws. This last one is the best of the five and it has some holes that need plugged. Good laws are goal
Exactly! So when should they discuss a good law? Two weeks from now? Or they could not take a break and work on it now.
they need to appoint a special committee to work on it, put a time line on it, and work on other things until that group has plan
@raerie @repjohnlewis so tired of the political grandstanding over a bad piece of legislation. Work and make it better #goodbill?
keep up the good fight,,, Thank You
@raerie @repjohnlewis are the Democrats going to work today or engage in more self-promotion? Use this time to WORK on solution
It's tough to work and make something better if half of the people (and one entire party) isn't there. The senate shot down 4
Thank you for your personal sacrifices for the good of me and my country.  Thank you for being right where you are right now.
Keep up the good fight so no American 6 yr old can recite school lockdown protocols
Evry idiot sitting-in congress for this should resign, if u don't understand the 2nd am, u don't deserve your job @SenWarren #NoBillNoBreak
Fraud Lizawatha
WE ARE GLAD YOU ARE THERE   HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN THERE       HOW LONG WILL YOU STAY
Happy Belated Birthday to you, I am an admirer and am proud to share a birthday with such strong advocate
Thank you for pushing the critical issue of gun control, and all that you do.
Thank you both for being there. THANK YOU!
Democrats, years of experience in sitting around doing nothing
protest radical islam, not legitimate gun owners
Happy Birthday Senator Warren!!!! And THANK YOU! #goodtrouble
Maybe start simply. Why are gun shops open 24/7? Why not limit ammunition sale?  Have a wait period after purchase?
Thank you so much for taking a stand - rather, sit for Americans. For the first time, I am proud of the house!
#goodtrouble #NoBillNoBreak thank you
Sounds good to me.  Stay as long as you want.  No nonsense legislation for a while.  Buffoons...
I'm thankful my children have people like yourselves to look up to & emulate
@RepJoeKennedy @repjohnlewis Good place for you. Now just keep your mouth shut.
Thank you!
Belated Happy Birthday, Senator Warren! Thank you for supporting our @HouseDemocrats
