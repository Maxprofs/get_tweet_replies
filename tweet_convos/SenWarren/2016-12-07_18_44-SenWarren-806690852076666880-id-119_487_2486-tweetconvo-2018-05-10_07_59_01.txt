@SenSanders @SenJeffMerkley Part 2 of reason why voting No to this Bill was the right move: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2CD-EtEYA4 … #CuresAct
@SenSanders @SenJeffMerkley had good reason to vote No to this Bill: Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1s12VfvS2g …  #CuresAct
Elizabeth! Get all those democrats in congress to get off of their dead asses and fight. You've got more balls than most .
sadly you can't fight them, Dems are not fighters Only recourse now is total obstruction of congress START FIGHTING!
please fight for a good FDA head too. Who he's considering is frightening
Sure, is this like HC with public/ private positions?
sorry your two left to extreme too crazy
#Warren2020  One of the few politicians who cares
We should cap the amount of perscriptions a doctor can write for opiods and opiates! This is how the heroin epidemic started!
important stuff. Please throw your weight into some of the other battles that are brewing now too!
:and any good decision Donald Trump makes! What a nasty lady!
that is all you think your ilk needs held accountable for? How truly do any of you sleep at night? #ambienmuch
how about congress living under the same rules as the everyday person.
proud of you!!
work you magic!!
please work on impeachment plan!
If Obama had one tenth of your fight, Clinton would be president.
Thank you Senator. We can not afford to ignore the opioid problem even one day longer. It is a tragedy
You need to start speaking with those electorals or we are doomed.
Thank you please stay on them. And what's up with $500 billion deal with exon/ mobile and Putin...keep an eye on sanctions.
You are useless.
NO REFUNDS!
Are you still talking?  Most people would chill after being exposed to claim a false minority for personal gain. Fake Indian
This is why I was so adamant about your staying in the Senate. We need you there too badly.
proud of u
**Posturing
I hope you do.
**Can you define creditibility for me?
Pass the Miners Protection Act
I appreciate your efforts, I really do. But you've got a constitutional crisis on the horizon. Are you ready?
We need u 2 fight to void this election if there's tangible proof that Russia hacked it!  Dems need a backbone & 2 play hardball!
Repeal it all. Obstruct, obstruct, obstruct. Just like they did. You owe it to democrats
THANK YOU! 
@cnn @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity                           Who is public enemy # 1
Solve problems 4 citizens while holding the powers accountable. The Great senators for Mass were there for its people @CoryBooker
thank you
please protect  Medicare
Thank God for people like Elizabeth Warren She's a leader but she can be a little afraid to voice he opinion
You have no notion of what it means to actually fight for anything.
I hope so. He's such a bully and it does feel reminiscent of Mccarthy.
We hope to see u with us on the 21st at the women's March! Will u be with us Senator Warren??
have you finished tweeting your horn?
Please don't let him intimidate or silence you.  We have your back and love you.
Thank you for fighting the good fight, Senator.
too bad you haven't EVER gotten anything done.  It's funny hearing your old lady screech sometimes though Pocahontas
Senator Warren it would trully be what we need if you would run for President in 2020.
Did You see how TRUMP TREATED A UNION REPRESENTATIVE FROM CARRIER THIS EVENING, DEPLORABLE  !
MY GAWD TRUMP IS A SOB!

let's hold the drug companies accountable and reset their wild prices back 5 years ago. Medicare drug costs have skyrocketed
Thank you Senator Warren.  We need people like you more than ever now.  Your efforts are much needed and appreciated.
have you heard the latest threat of who to give FDA to?  Thinks he is immortal and will stop clinical trials.  Public can test
time to beat the war drums, right?
Thanks for your hard work, Senator, you're awesome! #imwithher
You are my hero Senator!
How can you fight when your party is in clear minority?? Just holding congress accountable wont improve anything.
we love you.  Thanks!
