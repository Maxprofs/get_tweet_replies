Senate Finance Cmtee says it would not schedule a hearing before completion of the bipartisan vetting process.
Why then are @SenateGOP suspiciously rushing nomination? It's Donald who advocates "extreme vetting." 2x std?
Dems: “When you occupy this country’s highest positions of power, you manage trillions of dollars,
enforce more than two centuries of law, control the world’s most powerful military and make decisions
that are literally matters of life & death. Hence nominees need thorough vetting, not a rubber stamp
They ignore the ethics rules because they have no ethics. How do we stop them? Let them ruin USA?
There is more power in numbers. There are more of us than them. We must unite & stay focused.

Wikipedia has been edited to remove Rex Tillerson's "Order of Friendship" medal from Russia but there's still video.
@valentineomine @realDonaldTrump @nytimes I fear the cake is already baked.
Problem solved! Got rid of ethics rules. 
@Justbo314 @realDonaldTrump @nytimes and who is going to stop this trainwreck? We are toast. #byeamerica
The incoming Cabinet is above the law, above ethics and are swamp dwellers. #TrumpSwampParty
They are all corrupt, they don't need Congress giving them extra ingredients for the recipe~
Yea I want him to pick Poor people for his cabinet, so they can use their position for personal gain , like YOU did/do.
But the GOP is corrupt
Filling the swamp...

Serious ?: What do/can you do when (not if) they violate the rules? We know they SHOULDN’T, but they will. What next?
@bend_time @SenWarren the corruption has already started. #PayAttention
and I wasn't talking to you Barry. I think you are paying attention
I like to think so. :)
Thank you for your tireless efforts.  They are sincerely appreciated by Americans for the truth & the facts!
Talk about corruption!  You and Hillary should know all about corruption!  Both of you can give America lessons!
@opposetrump @realDonaldTrump @nytimes Expose the genuine "clowns" for what they are.
What makes you  think that not gonna happen???
Did @realDonaldTrump falsely claim native American heritage? Oh, that was YOU  @SenWarren.
we have been living under corruption for the last 8 yrs. why haven't you done anything Senator?
@JavelinaBlue @nytimes If no one enforces the rules they are meaningless. No one can. Not anymore. We are doomed.
Why would they violate the ethics laws? You throw out so many accusatory assertions. Trump is not even in office
Silent on Corrupt Hillary but she is great at projecting crime by GOP nominees. Amazing.
just like the Obama admin, the most 'transparent' er 'opaque/corrupt' admin in history
they are used to getting anything they want they will take what they can
u nothing but a crook. What's done in the dark will come to light
INTERESTING HE STOP IT FROM GOING THROUGH ,
WHY NOT listen TO YOUR BOSS and GIVE HIM A CHANCE
Get back to us when it actually happens.

Speak out loud & hard & in numbers before all our freedoms are taken away one by one.
Popular leaders don't rig elections, or NOT give press conferences or do nuclear policy deals & rant on twitter. Scared ones do.
YOU are a recipe for corruption. Democrats are on the side of satan. Support clinton=evil.
Well Yeah! Actually, though, his cabinet IS a recipe for corruption--a corruption stew of sorts!
Pocahontas is not qualified even to spell ethics. She's a liar and a fraud. Pathetic individual.
This coming from a woman who lied about having Native American Heritage so she could get access to Uni.
correction. effective 20Jan US will have Tsar Trumpevic
How about HILLARY'S 'recipe for corruption'? You have selective standards, Elizabeth ole girl.
The Clintonista's pay-for-play was extreme corruption. When are you going to demand their imprisonment?
@marcylauren @realDonaldTrump @nytimes Seems they have all had enough practice.
@VAPolitical @realDonaldTrump @nytimes 
Isn't his cabinet corrupt by design. When you appoint leaders who oppose the mission...
Contacted all Dems on twitter.  Found back stories of corrution. How does a fine fix a lack of integrity?Ugotit2
Hve read that nobody has been successful in trimming Gov. Congress is self protecting the status quo. Its over
Don't try 2 paralyze Trumps admn like U have done in the past tired of over spending & Gov shutdown. 20TRILLON!
I was completely hopeless until Mr.Trump won the Presidency. Congress is corrupt! 8 yrs term limits 2-sen, 4rep
Confused?  Clinton fdtn receives donations from half of the countries/leaders she visited as SOS, but no notice
If anybody knows corruption,it's the DEMS! Where were U when Bill visited Lynch? Y is there no cry 4 Clinton Fd
please fight them all being confirmed. More than half the country supports you Senator Warren#resist
To bad you didn't feel that way about the Clintons
If Trump & his billionaire club nominees who think they are above the law violate it, Dems please take ACTION & sue, censure etc
WHO HOLDS HIS FEET TO THE FIRE FOR JUSTICE?
where were you with the Clinton global initiative? Hypocrite Pocahontas.
Corruption is what has been happening in the past 8 years. Stop trying to speak failure on PEOTUS Trump
, you do know that @realDonaldTrump loves corruption. It's up to the remaining sane Politicians, you & @TheDemocrats to stop him.
look around you that's #CORRUPTION where were you???
Details of Trumps business deals & connections with many Russian businessmen/mobsters/money launderers. http://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/12/19/the-curious-world-of-donald-trumps-private-russian-connections/ …
.@SenWarren don't worry. They'd never try to compete with Dems or the Obama admin. Y'all win.  @realDonaldTrump @nytimes
We don't want corruption like the last 8 years of Democrat Rule!!!  impeach Obama!!!
Democrats talking about corruption like their whole party isnt corrupt LOL Pot meet Kettle!!
@luvman33wife @realDonaldTrump @nytimes you think?
http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/12/donald-trump-corruptible-214541 …
That cake is baked, Senator.  Suggest we call the FBI....wait...never mind.
Seems to me as that ship has already sailed.  Can we turn it around?
Go back to endorsing corporatist establishment puppets when it matters, Liz. #Bernie2020 @SenWarren @MAHAMOSA @realDonaldTrump @nytimes
Sen Warren stay vigilant. We need leaders like u to keep toddler trump in his play pen! POTUS 2020!
THE ILLEGITIMATE ELECT IGNORES THE ETHICS RULES. CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS ABOUND. AMERICA IS NOT HIS PIGGY BANK.
@Melacook0515 @realDonaldTrump @nytimes. Do you think Trump cares? He is already neck deep in corruption and getting by with it
nope! That's why we need every American protesting in the street til we bring him down.
. We can protest every day but until the politicians do something we are screwed
you're 100% right. That's why we need every voice, every day, until they do something.
we need more ppl protesting the inauguration than attending it. We must not give up.
the president can just pardon them.
kind of like the CLINTONS right? Such hypocrisy truly is astounding. I would have thought you better than this.
@CatherineHatf19 @realDonaldTrump   Trump and his band of wealthy weasels!  Nazi Bastards!
Ms Warren.  U certainly know of corruption.
Says the woman who supported HRC, one of the most corrupt people ever to take a breath!
-This cabinet is already rife w/corruption.
Unabashed greed. No checks and balances.
this supposed said swamp draining cabinet will be the most corrupt administration in US history. We are depending on ur oversight
Seems like us ordinary Americans just need to insist that they go through proper channels
HEY DRECK. GO BACK TO YOUR TEEPEE AND SHUT UP.
Also gives grounds for impeachment, once senate reachs agreement.
I hope you DEMS stand up to 'this goof
Hilarious coming from @TheDemocrats and #fakenews @nytimes #maga
GOP approves of crooks!
u mean like the clintons who took > $100M fr Wall St, not 2 mention the $s you took as well+lying on ur heritage
All trumps nominee should b required to have MRI. They have hearts of steal. Wipe them out in a nanosecond !
Don't let them get away with it Liz! #idiotelect
just like the Obama's fast and furious, IRS, don't you think ?
How will we know?Tillerson not giving up tax returns! #TrumpIsProfiteering #TrumpHasConflictsOfInterest
I expect someone in Trump's Cabinet will be investigated within 6 months.
You mean like Hillary Clinton
could we look to impeach all of these corrupt candidates? Especially @realDonaldTrump if he takes office? @nytimes
they are ignoring the ethics rule right along with trump. And no one is doing anything to stop it!
what would Liz Warren know about ethnics.
and investigation will lead to removal
@TheBaxterBean @realDonaldTrump @nytimes Do something about it! Filibuster all of his nominations! Don't just tweet distaste!
you should know you r a dem
@TheBaxterBean @realDonaldTrump @nytimes  it's a guarantee if corruption
our elected members of Congress must be vigilant. We are counting on you.
& then for empeachment, hopefully ...!
ya, cause theres no corruption in government now! And Dems are free of corruption!
Vote them down!!!
corruption warnings from a dem? Is this like that time you said you were native American and weren't
Only if they are Republicans. The world knows you Democrats ignore corruption in your own party.
you speak with forked tongue,you looked away from Hillary's conflicts with her foundation. IRS? Hello!!
So how do we stop it?
@mydoggigi @realDonaldTrump @nytimes Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
Keep up the pressure to keep them honest.
@jestei     Sounds funny coming from a Democrat. Ethics!! LOL
:you have enough to worry about your own nasty stuff! Quit diddling and get to work!
THAT'S RIGHT!  TRUMP'S MAFIOSO...
I wish you'd start drawing up impeachment papers.  Trump is a threat to the entire planet and has already committed impeachable
it is flat out corruption
Then do something abt it. The Right gets their way. But all I hear from left  "someone shld stop them"
corruption have always been around, now just open to all...I will b watching to see how many u will help to JAIL or impeach
so what is Congress going to do about it?
Will Trump go to war if his hotels suffer terror attack? Conflict of interest? Government pay global security?
Does no good if the ppl confirming his picks are as corrupt as he is.
It already is
recipe for impeachment too!
Oy! Pigs at the trough! Will they let the rest of us eat cake?
It's not "a recipe" - it IS corruption.
The 1% simply feel the rules do not apply to them. WRONG!!!!!!
corruption in your senate is rampant. We will drain the swamp, no worries.
Democrats need to get after the media!  The are the biggest obstacle.
Who enforces this?
When has the GOP had ethics in the past oh 8 years
Indian Princes Speaking Bull.
and Congress are experts in being corrupt. #MAGA
the corruption is already in play by trump and friends
just like the Dems oppose ALL democratic societies. they are the fascists, no question. watch them carefully.
the Dems will drag their feet, do whatever they can to stop Trump. what a bunch of losers.the People love Trump.
THE REAL CORRUPTION is the NYT, the WP and the democrats. it was all over the news, remember? short memories:)
I don't think producing tax returns and divesting conflicts of interest is too much to ask
Just wait 'til you see my choices for SCOTUS.  Thinking about brave county clerk Kim Davis, but, sad, only a 4.
The people are relying on our elected reps to grow a backbone & #ResistTrump. PLEASE Don't let us down!
Feels as though @GOP has decided to pretend this is not a problem and there's not enough #Dems to stop it.
It is called TRICKLE DOWN GOV CORROSION.
The Democrats and Clintons wrote the recipe .
all of them sold their soul to the Devil!!
Recipe for corruption: see Bill & Hillary
Sorry @SenWarren but 70 year old @Trump already started the #corruption.
When he became president was adv on Gov website.
@realDonaldTrump
I hope you, and your colleagues, are prepared to actually do something about this.
the recipe is impeachment.  We don't have to get along with this naïf, just catch and release
Are you really qualified to spot corruption when it stares you in the face?
Trump has no ethics so...
he will just issue presidential pardons. His corrupt family and friends know there is no risk. 
No Darling, it is the "right" thing to do ":) Merry Christmas  @realDonaldTrump
go march somewhere with your evil little feet  @realDonaldTrump @nytimes
They are already corrupt which is why @realDonaldTrump chose them. Do lambs select wolves or lambs to flock with
SIMPLE : NO RULES FOLLOWED - NO CONFIRMATION
And corruption is a recipe for impeachment.
impeach his dictating ass
It can't be any worse than my recipe for chicken soup: 'take two whole chickens and a bunch of stuff stolen from Safeway'.
maybe we just go with "countdown to corruption".  Saddle up Senator, time to round up the scumbags.
News flash, corruption is displayed everyday on the CNN!!Disgraceful!!
Sounds like the Clinton's &the whole damn Dem Party!!  @KellyannePolls
Ethics, eh? This from an outed  phony American Indian?
You're really going to have to jail ppl to show that this isn't a pay to play govt. #realtalk
and you should be familiar with corruption having been a Hillary Clinton supporter Elizabeth
facts?
really?
“@SenWarren: If President-elect @realDonaldTrump's cabinet nominees ignore the ethics rules, I please look into the Russian hacking
It's more than a recipe, it's an invitation
that should be "when" not "if".
grind this administration to a halt. they will do nothing good. and we should do everything we can to stop them.
Yes it is....they don't understand what corruption is. It's their way of life
And every member of Congress, including you, Fauxcahontas.
And destruction; potentially on a scale we've never seen before in the U.S. @realDonaldTrump
Didn't apply to HRC
, @realDonaldTrump is brazenly ignoring ethics rules. The corruption has already begun. Please fight for us on the hill!!!
I know you can be counted on 2 stand against @realDonaldTrump & his cabinet of crooks @nytimes Dont give one inch #TheResistance
The Tangerine Tyrant's ELECTION is a recipe for corruption the likes of which we've never seen before.
Please explain how @SenatorReid became a multi-millionaire on a congressional salary. @realDonaldTrump @nytimes
They're well on their way! Every move Trump make needs to be seriously investigated!
What was Americas undoing?? Arrogance, ignorance and a lack of ethics's
