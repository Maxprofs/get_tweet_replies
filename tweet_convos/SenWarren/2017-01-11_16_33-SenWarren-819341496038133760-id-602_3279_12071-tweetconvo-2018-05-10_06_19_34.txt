if he really wanted to make it great, he'd recuse himself from taking office immediately b/c he's unfit.
lol. Poor snowflakes
says the tiny dicked troll lol
good comeback. Proves you're a lib, inability to think. And I'm 6'5", 10" isn't tiny (or relevant)
lol if u have to brag (snicker) then it really must be teeny tiny ... like ur buddy @realDonaldTrump #LOSER #NotFooled
responding to your lunacy is bragging ?
10" NOT ur the one who's Lil smokie is dangling limply 4 all to see ... u can't blame me for taking the opp to "poke" fun lol
it's the fact all can see which proves your a lunatic lol
President Trump funded his own election unlike you democrats funding a billion dollar Loser.
We all know he doesn't want to make America great or put America first. We know this. You know this. Fix it. @realDonaldTrump
he's working keeping jobs in US, improving healthcare, securing border, yeah you're right, so dumb!
unemployment lowest in decades...Yeah, he has LOADS to "fix"
@trevdick @realDonaldTrump or give much of his wealth away!
Put yours!
He can't divest, he owes hundreds of millions to Russia. It's the same reason he won't release his tax returns.
Sayeth the clueless cat lady lol
Yes I'm a cat lady. And? Also, seems you're the clueless one. Classic projection.
he's not clueless, he has "his" cocktail out, he's clearly a serious person 
Emma loves a large cocktail in her hand......
urgh! Bye
Actually, he should resign the presidency.

if he truly cares he'll do what's right&resign. Election was a fraud but no one does anything about it, as usual
like Obama &Clinton did?
U probly aren't aware that he doesn't have to nor do we care
Trump has gone over & beyond what is legally required. Why dont YOU practice what u want to legislate?
--must You hate so much that you continue to interfere with America's progress under President Elect Trump-letGO
@mediccaptfm @realDonaldTrump He won't Make America great. He'll make it Trumplandia thanks lying 2 faced #MightyratComey
@APurp3 @realDonaldTrump 
Donald Trump & Mike Pence are illegitimate bc they're fascists! Hitler was elected.
Not everyone can parlay a lie into wealth and success like your claim to NAI heritage; if U can't prove your lineage it's lack of integrity.
Would you be asking @HillaryClinton to divest her assets if she won the election?
yes. Can you call for impeachment when he doesn't ?
Why do you keep saying this? He has no intentions of doing that , and that is the least worrisome thing going on
How long before he's impeached
Warren, are u trying to get your greedy hands on Prez DJT's assets? UR obsessed & jealous of his fortune!
Liz, be a part of the solution, not the problem. What do you have to lose? Liberalism is rejected. Learn/Join.
poor Pocahontas so jealous and such a sore loser. How can YOU question Trumps integrity?? Yeah, you can't 
Trump does not need presidency to become rich. He already is. Unlike Clintons.
Do you remember when Bill Clinton took office and was "poor"?  Donald Trump will not get rich being president.
He'll never do that; he's the most selfish, egocentric Russian stooge in the world.
but he doesn't, so he won't. sad.
and if he doesn't and won't what will Congress do?! Let him skate again?
--stop hating! He has better intentions for America than all the left put together.
Tough when he doesnâ€™t know what that is.
Taking no salary & donating to US Treas, bad.  $100mil vay-cay Pres, good.
You can't expect the man to undo/ignore previous life or beggar himself to be president. What is your before?
What have you done, EW, to MAGA?  You supported Hilliary! SHAME on YOU! Corruption by association! Divest YOUR assets.
How is this even possible, with his name on buildings worldwide? He=his name=his brand.
And he would prove he had nothing to hide by sharing his tax returns. People -do- want to see them.
.@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Since Trump won't divest, Congress must appt committee/commission to #SubpeonaTaxReturns re #Trumprussia
@mediccaptfm @realDonaldTrump Actually he will resign and go back to the businesses he refuses to give up and be our president.
Awhile back I predicted trump has no interest in job! Once fills coffers/unloads debt may resign!
I find it hilarious that all of a sudden Democrats are concerned about the Constitution.
and if you truly want lower college costs you'll take no salary and return every penny you were paid.
mean like how much money u get for speaking at a college don't forget the money that you got claiming you have Native American
And exactly how did you make your fortune Sen Warren? Did you divest ALL your assets? Do U have any conflicts?
How is Trump allowed to do that if illegal? Shouldn't he have legal consequences for ALL Of his actions?
Obviously Trump is aware of her donation as he is telling America to shop at LL Bean. Whennot hold him to laws?
amazing job with Carson yesterday. He can't even say Trump wouldn't get HUD money to develop more land
there's only one way the Orange Pedophile Elect could make America greater
he is his own special interest !
if he truly wants to make America great, he'd crawl back under his rock in trump tower. Thank U, Sen for being U
If @SenWarren wants to make America Great end war w @realDonaldTrump, revamp ACA, confirm Cabinet and provide positive input. End the rift.
your opinion is obviously not the correct opinion or it would be done.
there is no law that requires him to do so. Clinton started his truce while still in office. Look at your family
is there a law that says he has to?
Not Possible or required by law! Why no interest in @ClintonFdn illicit Saudi $ made Clintons Rich$$???
There is not Constitutional requirement that he do so.
he should give his business to you right? Can you see around you? tons of sick and ambitious rats
Its about making him King.. Has nothing to do with America
o just saw earlier, his two sons will be running it. I didn't think that was legal. Most things he does aren't
All of this is theatre to Trump. It is his way of deflecting from his lack of knowledge & substantive comments
@mikcol16 @realDonaldTrump He could also confess to treason
Attack Trump all you like but where's your outrage over this sorry  showing by your colleagues 
If he doesn't divest his Presidency will be mired in scandal and conflicts of interest that may lead to impeachment. #warren2020
@damonbethea1 @SenWarren for gosh sakes let's hopehe gets impeached &takes the GOP withhim!I've never seen the likes of this
you know as well as the rest of us he wont do it unless he is made to! your wasting your breath!

And what  do you have to say about Wall St Shill @CoryBooker & 12 Dem Senators voting w/ GOP against importing cheaper drugs?
@MAHAMOSA @realDonaldTrump Exactly what is the connection, Liz, between America Great Again & a Trump Blind Trust?  Are you high?
@MAHAMOSA @realDonaldTrump so you are admitting that America isn't "great".
@MAHAMOSA @realDonaldTrump Your brain must be in a blind trust. You sold out BERNIE. You are FAKE FAKE FAKE!
@MAHAMOSA @realDonaldTrump Stop the Twitter arguing and do something constructive, Warren.  Earn your keep.
I fully agree.
so where have U put UR $14.5 Mil how much of that fortune was gained while US Senator? At &174,000/yr good job.
I know we can count on u. And Trump, u r the most unpopular PEOTUS to ever take office. Do NOT think otherwise!
Sen Warren, I know u are a true warrior. Please stand up 4 the majority who will be harmed under Trump & Repubs.
@effiedog @realDonaldTrump Silly you....it's Make Trump Great Again.
liz, why?
@kattjenny1  correct and divulge his taxes
why not put your assets and all other in Senate in a blind trust. Your nothing but a bag of hot air.
keep up the great fight Senator I'm proud of you !
Mr Trump, we are watching you.
are you concerned with legislating or being Donald Trump's financial advisor?
I'm satisfied with the plan he has proposed. You should try supporting his plan instead of your irrelevant tweet
there has to be a petition for Trump to release his TAXES!
you continue make yourself look like a fool. What he has done is more than many in the past have done!
unfortunately he don't even know
talk about "Crooked". He epitomizes the word!
how about he just walk away and we never have to hear from the putrid jerk again!!!
But then he wouldn't be able to profit from his "Big Win".
Pocohontus, help make America great again!
1) Retire from Sen.
2) Delete Twitter acct
3) Get needed psych help.
How much uranium did @POTUS just send over to Iran the other day, Liz? What did you do to stop that?
You must have missed yesterday's Press Conference.
And when you and VP pick Bernie Sanders run for President as a team- I will vote for you.
Agreed, blind trust is way the to go. If @SenWarren wants to make America great she'll give up socialism & quit Congress.
MsW, I think u just like to act like u know what the hell is going on. Go flip more foreclosures tomake more $$$
I guess u didn't watch the REAL news yesterday. & asking Dr Carson if he can guarantee PEOTUS won't make a penny blah, blah,.....
@misdaws @realDonaldTrump I think we all know that is NOT what the #FakePresident truly intends to do.
Trump had conflicts of interest. He told people to shop at LL Bean today!
Control corrupt money in your party first please.
And why should we expect such an ethical thing from him? He believes he is untouchable as President and before
We will be forced to fight a second US Civil War because of enemies of the US like E Warren. We have no choice.
Do you know that when I listen to you I believe with all my heart those who say we will be forced to fight
He already is making america Great again in SPITE of scum like you. We all will help him.
He won't do it. He is disrespecting the office.
What he does with his life long work is NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS you twit! He has done as he saw fit by LAW!.
The guy gives up $400K/yr, donates ALL his proceeds to the treasury, divests his biz & ur still bitchin! U Luzer
you're a hypocrite You pretend to hate the big banks but campaigned heavily for HRC who was paid off big by them
just hold onto your pantsuit dear.  He's going to MAGA with or without you.
what about Dem corruption when will that be an bipartisan issue!
The crook @JohnKerry just steered up to $50 million in juicy no-bid contracts to his own daughter @VBKerry
Yes, @JohnKerry abused his position to give no-bid contracts to own daughter @VBKerry 
A crook!
No such thing for him. He isn't going to "forget" he has a tower in Istanbul or a gold course in Scotland.
Did your Kennedy buddies divest of theirs? Lol
Yes Sen are you selling your assets too?
During primary & campaign @realDonaldTrump said he'd use a blind trust. Another broken promise.
As always Liz, you are being unreasonable. No matter what Trump does, you will find a way to criticise it.
he did moron
Princess Buffalo Fart Warren needs to divest her ill-gotten assets. Crook!
if you truly wanted to make America great & not grandstand u would attempt to work w/Pres not bash him in media.
He will not work with her. It would be an exercise in futility for her to go that route.
that shows you know nothing about him.Even his enemies say, u come to him he listens.Doesn't mean agrees
Senator be  diligent to keep Social Security.Medicare. Can't afford to live now! Scarred!
@jimmyj48125 @realDonaldTrump He never will because....HE IS AN EVIL NARCISSISTIC PUNK
@jimmyj48125 @realDonaldTrump he can't sell loans probably on everything how many times has he declared bankruptcy?
@drdoodlie1994 @realDonaldTrump That Press Conf shows he'll never divest unless forced to!
Rep Brooks accusing Democrats of war on whites as basis for accusations of racism against Sessions. Trying to start a race war?
@KyleKulinski @realDonaldTrump  Elizabeth could have made America great if she would have supported Bernie Sanders.
Just like she did
So disingenuous of yourself to claim otherwise- Nepotism has been rife throughout Politics/Government/Monarchy since antiquity;-(
What about th Bush family?Their assets?Kennedy's?Their assets? SaxeCoburgGotha/Windsor? Their assets? They're ALL GuiltyofSame;-(
Agree...Obama put his assets in bonds. Jimmy Carter sold his peanut farm.
It's the Pillory for their latest "hate figure" before he begins- BBC was reporting on his coming "impeachment" this eve!
why don't you do the same?
he doesn't want to make America great, he just wants to sell baseball caps to dumb people.
The truth is that a real blind trust would not work. Trump would always know what assets he owns and that is key
Elders
we should stick with fact and not name calling. Your fact tweets are great. Keep them coming... 
I say no health insurance for Washington until new plan is in check - motivation
we are counting on you all to stop this fiasco. It has gone on far too long!
. @SenWarren @JessikaJayne @realDonaldTrump & should he fail to, proceedings must initiate immediately - already concrete acts vs emoluments
so what can we do to demand that he divest? This is out of control. What is next?
I'm with you 100%!Every day there is another TrumpquakeGod save 
SHUT UP!
he needs to be held accountable on this blind trust,this confusing plan of his smells of corruption and fraud.
@JackieFarnham @realDonaldTrump he won't
Keep up the pressure @SenWarren! Are you listening, @realDonaldTrump????? @lisamurkowski @SenDanSullivan @repdonyoung
anything less then a blind trust is unacceptable, he needs to be held to the same standards as everyone else.
Did you have to divest your assets to be a US senator?
Now pay attention: The Federal Law on conflict of interest exempts the Vice President and the President. You'll be tested later
what can I do as a US citizen to convince Trump to change his plan?
this is old talking points, this ship has sailed, he has all but said  " we have come to rape and pillage "
Owning the companies are not unethical. Why punish him before he does anything wrong?
is this the only thing you have to bitch about?
THANK YOU Senator Warren. Please do NOT let up on this issue. The PEOTUS must be held accountable.
he has already done more than is legally required of him, and is donating profits to America.  Go home Elizabeth
are you jealous of his empire that he built?
Obama care saved my life losing it will kill people with ED in 20s not on parents insurance will end lives

give it up
If Donnie boy wants to make America great again he needs to leave. Thank you sen Warren.
Don't think President @realDonaldTrump will take business advice from a commie.
LOL, yeah, right. Just divest himself of everything but the clothes on his back, right?
and taxes!!
and resigning
should insist his family, advisors, and cabinet should also divest into blind trusts.   #newamendment
was the #payforplay #ClintonFoundation a blind trust? Just asking...#MAGA #PizzaGate
I'm "only" a citizen and I want to see Trumps tax returns. #heishidingsomething
Won't happen and he correctly pointed out that we don't care about it. My question is, Why is it allowed.
if he truly wants to make America great & put America first, he will not take the oath of office.
They are businesses he grew, not like they just investments
D never wanted to make America "great".  Only in it for the personal gain and attention.  Ignorance = suicide.
America was great before he became the President Elect.  Don't fall for his  propaganda.
You made a fool of yourself, senator, by being a cheer leading sycophant for the worst person on earth.
Good luck on that one! Waiting for his tweet, "only reporters care about this issue".
and you'll shut up, eek shut up  @realDonaldTrump
mind ur business warren. He doesn't have to do anything according to the law and he is doing more than his share
but he doesn't. He's just trying to become the billionaire he never was. Too old to earn it, he'll steal from us
so says the faker belong to the party of criminals and hypocrites, @TheDemocrats. #Liberals butt hurt 4ever #TRUMP #MAGA
It is not your money Sen Warren. So let him just be so he can clean up the mess of the last 16 years.
THANKS FOR EXPLAINING THE CLINTON FOUNDATION!
@SummersAnne @realDonaldTrump just like your 'Native American' Trust?
and delete his Twitter.
Oh Lizzie. It must be exhausting to come up with new ways to repeat yourself. Sure hope you don't cook that way.
and delete his tweet account! and grow up
stop worrying about a Trump and go watch #Obamacare crash and burn. Better help come up with a new plan cause it's done !!
and release his taxes!!!
thats none of ur business people put him in the White House bitter pill for u tough live with it
...and then resign and undergo psychiatric observation...
He doesn't and he won't.
No tax returns, no cabinet. That's what I'd like.
AND RELEASE TAXES! It's not just the reporters that want them. What are you hiding? #RESISTANCE
The scary thing about this is that it sets a precedent and "pathway" for nondisclosure. Dangerous unaccountability.
But he said he can run his business & be the president.  He's the ONLY person ALIVE that can do both!!!! <----- sarcasm font
@JuddApatow @realDonaldTrump or stop lying O and maybe show tax returns please. We want to know how much Russia owns you
