and so what are you and your colleagues going to DO to stop this madness?
what can they do
Dunno, but if the tiny Tea Party can blow up the status quo, why can't the sane 68% of the population do it too?
we can and we are. Call your senator and reps and tell them what you want.
I call them every day.
that's insane.
Five or ten minutes a day to make my voice heard? I disagree. I think it's time well spent.
bet you didn't think it wasn't insane when the tea party did it.
Really? I'm investment advisor. Are you calling me a theif? A cheat? #libel I'm a regstrd Dem and vote for HRC. Am I still a bad?
She knows the people who support democrats are stupid and will believe whatever she says.
Sir the people that I have met who support Trump do not know the difference between facts and fiction.
(not sure if I was the Sir in your response) I've met some of them too. Which is why I voted for HRC
what do you think about shutting down the Clinton Global Initiative cuz the donations dried up? Sad?
I was surprised. Keep it open even if it is just for the free coffee and swanky office space.
it doesn't bother you that the foreign donations dried up the minute she lost the election?
investment advisors are already fiduciaries. You're referring to brokers. Lack of destinction by press & gov is part of problem.
Prior to Regs after an employee moved $ out of a 401k due to retirement, the advisor was no longer a fiduciary.
sorry but you're misinformed-only brokers (who are often call themselves and are referred to as advisors) are not fiduciaries
A coworker w/ cancer trusted our fiduciary He put her in an annuity & she passed in 10 months. I begged her to get 2/3 opinions
sorry to hear about your friend's experience. If that person was a fiduciary then enforcement is the action needed not more regs
Again, once $ left a 401k plan they aren't a 'fiduciary'. I asked legal & they confirmed at time this was common. Regs needed
I agree regs are needed but we also need distinction. You called him a fiduciary. Sounds to me like a commissioned broker.
As an SEC registered "advisor" I am a fiduciary no matter what account I advise on and happy to act in client's best interest
Running on a platform, representing the Little person, Obama GAVE 1,000,000,000.00 to WALL STREET. #lefttheleft
yes trumps plan was to drain Americans and save the swamp! It was just an honest mistake #KellyAnnConway
again like the Dems. did to S.S. and SENIORS ????
#WallStreetCronies
Trump removed law
"Investors must work in best interest of clients"
WHOs looking out for US?
I wish the gov't would stop trying to cheat me out of my savings with its entitlement programs!!!
.@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Doesn't seem to be cheating you out of your $14.5M net worth. Who do you invest your $ with? Hypocrite.

@lady_scribbler Poor Donnie wants his friends to get loans!
Trump says will cut "a lot out of Dodd-Frank" because "friends of mine that have nice businesses, they can't borrow" http://cnb.cx/2kZQCzc

Young lady, that is main reason there companies in this World that makes mattresses, cigar boxes and ice trays.

@SanFranMoman @realDonaldTrump We're doomed from every angle

TY for the heads up, Elizabeth!
SenWarren Trump does not care about America. Rich tax cuts,bank fraud. He and Brannon has to go!

#impeachmentsoon
He has made it easier for them because this is what he has been doing for years where is his taxes
let's see, what do you call obomination delivering $150,000,000 tax dollars to the devil in Iran. Hypocrites
No the democratic party taxed us out of our savings
What ever happened to bringing Wall Street back in line, and protecting consumers?
Look who Trump has in his cabinet. He only cares 4 the wealthy. When will his minions get that???
fake news fauxcahantas.
you don't know what you are talking about, i say this as an investment advisor
- Toooo bad he didn't try to make it more difficult for YOU to CHEAT people out of scholarship money and a JOB??
Keep Fighting
Only one cheating here is your twisted agenda and your misrepresentation of facts.
hey dummy, these guys know the system. Why would they rip us off? They already have $$ Unlike many of you.
You should have been on the ticket. Keep up the great work.
@POTUS @FLOTUS As a retired veteran teacher for 40 years I urge you to protect not destroy my retirement savings
I am curious, is claiming to be Native American Indian...is that cheating? Sure sounds like it.
HOW CAN WE EDUCATE the people as to what this corporate takeover of U.S. Government means?
it's time to neuter the stinking fox
We need to stop this maniac, National day of prayer needed, pray for God to stop this mad man! #T fool
@_juliannemoore @realDonaldTrump #maga voters have been had.Voted against own interests because: emails, Benghazi  #RESISTANCE

is this "drain the swamp"?
stop tweeting ma'am and start removing him
Those who can least afford it will get hit, even the ones who voted for that psycho. I hope they're satisfied.
making the rich richer daily while screwing the middle class, that should have been your slogan
what I think the elite are unaware of is that a real revolution is brewing. Be careful for all our sakes.
Voters fell for his lies. Paying price now; will they even realize?!?
@bklynmike3 @realDonaldTrump joke's on them - I have no savings!
Congresional Repubs seem to be out to destroy the middle class. No SS no Medicare, no ACA, no EPA, no protection
of course he did. we expect staunch opposition to everything this lunatic wants. Just say, "no."
@75flyers I'm a CFP. This is a disgrace. We are nothing without our integrity
we all need to be outraged over Trump's disregard for the working class
For all the fuss about Clinton's paid speeches Trump spewed during the primary, his 5 Goldman advisors r a lie!
#IMPEACHTRUMP Trump... liar, cheater, self-serving traitor to America.
@HarperRausch @realDonaldTrump So the rich can get richer.
  lies & dividing USA plz first help @HillaryClinton find missing $6B from state dept
@ChosenLawyers @realDonaldTrump
We need to go back to the popular vote and get rid of the electoral college. Then everyone's vote will count.
That's not news to me! I expected him to  do all that he's done so far and more.
ACA knowledge is proof that insurance agents are needed.Same with Financial Advisors, some good, some bad, need to be repaired.
POTUS the biggest LIAR! We see u, you hypocrite, we see you & your Goldman Sachs buddies
after all the complaining and blaming he did to Hillary Clinton look at him
PLEASE RUN IN 2020 !
: One thing I Know: Respect is Something U Earn..Trump =TRASH ! This is NOT a Pres.that earns it! He's a ConMan
Sen Warren, I thank God for you everyday! Keep up the GREAT work you do for us! Thank you!
@stlouisishome @realDonaldTrump Aren't they just wonderful people Liz?
@NotMyPresNYC @realDonaldTrump oh ok is that why the market is stronger then ever. Crooked Hillary would have ignited a crash.
guess you missed out on that part of ECON 101 but what's good for finance isnt necessary good for the economy
All Americans should watch The Big Short, for a preview of what's coming soon from Wall Street.
instead of saying lock her up he hold have chanted lock THEM up. Instead he's rolled out the red carpet.
As seen by Dems Cheating  u out of ur savings. Really is letting u make a choice.  Dems think people r too stupid to do.  No!
This is NOT making America Great. This is making Trump & his Billionaire cabinet heads Richer.
when are you going to start dispensing your millions to all the poor
.@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
@FaithFortune99 @realDonaldTrump stop approving his nominees. K thx

#resist It makes me I'll to know the taxpayer will pay expenses 4 this man but not fund ACA, EPA, parks, etc.
gov's role = make sure the little guy is not overrun big corporate and big wall st greed. POTUS do your job
.@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; cannot serve God and mammon.
@cdevries1 @realDonaldTrump Again FFS!!!!!!

.@SenWarren @Jacobr @realDonaldTrump Trust Records Show Trump Is Still Closely Tied to His Empire https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/us/politics/donald-trump-business.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur&_r=1&referer= …
Rarely are the FT so forthright in attacking what assists the short term profits of advertisers.
@SenSanders @SenSchumer Please stop preaching to the choir! Emphasize need to vote in 2018 to effectively stop the chaos!
Warren/Schneiderman 2020... or sooner god willing before we have to #calexit

UNACCEPTABLE!
only people that can speak without bad mouthing and lies and respect and kindness for all. And no scamming ppl.
2)any other wannabe Pres. that don't show taxes or will divest or that call being respectful, political. I say
this was his plan from day one and you law makers allowed it to go on. I say get a bill in place now to avoid
fiduciary duty is a foreign concept to a narcissist.
I had mine robbed by a coal company that 2 months earlier donated big money to the Bush campaign in 2004
APPALLING! On this action alone we should IMPEACH T'RUMP!
Easy there Jokahontas, I don't think I'd trust anything coming out of your mouth. #urnotanindian
The new President has an agenda to protect his billionaire cronies. Placing most Americans vulnerable.
Listen here Fauxahontas, this is great news for Americans. Smart people know that profit motives = ethical bhvr

Good job!
CHEAT! 45% payraises for Massachusetts politicians

Any way we can talk Yellen into raising interest rates dramatically? A spike in inflation would send this crew packing.
