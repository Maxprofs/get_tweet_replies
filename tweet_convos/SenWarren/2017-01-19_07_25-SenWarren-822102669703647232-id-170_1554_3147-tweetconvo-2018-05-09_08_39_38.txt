YOU DIDNT WANT TO HEAR FROM US WHO HAVE LOST OUR HEALTH INS CAUSE WE COULDN'T AFFORD IT!
I WORKED AT A FQHC & KNOW WHAT GOES ON. PPL DONT KNOW ILLEGALS ARE BUSED IN FOR HEALTHCARE WHILE S HAVE BEEN TURNED AWAY COULDNT PAY.
IT IS A FRAUD. YOU COMMITTED FRAUD WHEN YOU CLAIMED YOU WERE INDIAN . YOU TALK ABOUT THE RICH WHEN YOU ARE THE RICH. YOUR FAKE
Hey Warren, did you ever check the ages of those you stole houses from to make a profit?
When Repukes praise Reagan this is what they're proud of. Disgusting, EVIL and shameful GOP.
think he overlooks every single banking move? Impossible.
Liberals favorite words: might, may, could, possibly, perhaps
You forgot RACIST
the terms are laid out in plain English this isn't something I'd call a scam. They pay you and then own the house
Of course not! They're not for the people. They've obstructed for 8 years...they've shown that they don't care!
you are a #corrupt #terrorist who should be sent to the same prison as @BarackObama @SenFeinstein and #DougMittelman... @FBI @CIA
I think you do. Another foreclosed house you can get your fingers on.
Your party has been decimated by Obama and Hillary. Time for Democrats to wake up and smell the coffee.
Thank you EW
Damned shame! These hearings are a farce. @GOP not interested in the truth! Even when it's blatant.
Sen Warren time to vote these people out of office
Rem Warren silent in 2009 whn Obama apprvd multi million dollar bonuses to AIG execs as part of taxpayer bailout? #WhyDemsLost
Obama hammered AIG for what they did, and so did Senator Warren.  You are rewriting history.  Use YouTube.  It's informative.
Not exactly.He actually lied,feigned surprise,fake outrage whn it became public until Sec of Treas said Obama apprvd it first
And no, that's not how it works.  The House holds the purse strings.  President approval is LAST.
Warren we don't believe you Trump supporters know the truth your fake new Senator and a Hillary butt kisser
@SenSchumer @GOPSenFinance 
Then pay off her mortgage with all your millions! Put your money where your mouth is!
an evil lying idealogue trying to end American liberty
Everyone in trumps team are crooks.
He's like a bomber pilot they never see the people they kill and don't want to
observing what is happening in US from Sydney, Aus is quite sickening. Marchin tmrw in Sydney!
they should be ashamed of themselves pushing these wolves into cabinet positions they will use to get rich.
u failed to disclose a $1.3 million line of credit provided to you by Bank of America phoney.
you will probably be looking for work next election for your job. listen to the people not just a few groups.
So, did you buy her one?

You are so fake, you will never be a Bernie Sanders..

@SenSchumer @GOPSenFinance got proof Pocahontas?
@dangillmor @GOPSenFinance That would make them real
@SenSchumer @GOPSenFinance As in, she got the benefit of the reverse loan and you wsnted Medicaid to get her house?
He is crook in a suit.
@DeanLeh @GOPSenFinance none of them care about us anymore.
work to be done, no time for the usual dug up sob story BS
thanks @SenWarren for speaking truth for the People
Since they no longer work 4 their. Others but Wall st, we will ensure their voters reject them
Why do Redumlicans hate the country?
don't care about people just themselves and power.
No matter all of Trumps nominee's will get in GOP has no balls to stand up 2 him & they agree with most of them.
Congress approved it just like the affordable care act, you freaking democrats suck, real people want change not your lib crap
@SenSchumer @GOPSenFinance 
Falls under the
"If I don't want to believe it, it's not true"
delusion disorder.
He does not believe on realism.
.@SenWarren @GOPSenFinance if Democrats refused to prosecute bankers for their crimes when they had power why should we trust outrage now?
@Betsy_Manning @GOPSenFinance we are dreaming if we think they are going to stop this national travesty since they are  engineers
@Betsy_Manning @GOPSenFinance let's be realistic GOP  has deserted our country in order to increase their personal wealth
was it a scam or are you lying again. Another indication you can't tell the whole truth.
Emotions are not facts. You are a proven LIAR, we don't trust you anyway.
that would appear on the news and open an@old wound.  They should though
it's funny how republicans don't want to hear anything re trumps nominees Just image for a sec if this was hillary
Didn't you take a old lady's house for 30,000 and flip it for 115,000
thank you Senator Warren for sticking up for us!!
Because the tyranny of anecdotes is a tired democrat tactic that no longer works on adults or the educated
@SenSchumer @GOPSenFinance this stinks
Republican Party leaders are immoral narcissists like their comrade in chief
this is disturbing! He needs to be stopped!!
@realDonaldTrump was NEVER draining the swamp just replenishing it w/ experts & pros of sabotage to We the People
So thankful for you Decency, honesty and bravery Mrs Warren God keep you safe . You give us hope.
Colleen voted for Trump?
1%'s mantra=deny, deny, deny, delay, delay, delay, don't pay, don't pay, don't pay
GOP GETS CONFUSED AND IS ALLERGIC TO FACTS,
Hmmmm. And why not
they do not care about americans! only the morons who support them is what matters! oh and money!
I believe your motto is take from the poor and give to the rich
Irrelevant; haven't u heard? Mnuchin's bringing technology to fix IRS! That will walk everything back.
That's because @stevenmnuchin1 and @realDonaldTrump are #PutinPuppet and trying to committee into one!
Can't wait to buy that one to flip it, eh Liz?
fun of Donald Trump using Twitter what a hypocrite you are
Well you the democrats want everyone to loose their home

Wasn't you family making money by kicking people out of their homes? Please stop your bullshit.
GOP needs to remember that 2.8 million more voted against this administration! We are watching and organizing!
Didn't you hear his answer? Maybe you should take a chill pill.
@SenSchumer  Liz we all know you are a liar... fake news from a fake Indian...
@SenSchumer @GOPSenFinance link
Mnuchin didn't make the loans, loans were made before he took over get your facts straight!
@SenSchumer @GOPSenFinance and u scammed Harvard by saying u are an American Indian to get free beees
Better hold a Pow Wow!
Why aren't you listening to the public Sen. Finance?  You serve personal interest-Not the Ppl.
Pocahontas has no credibility.  We are still waiting on evidence for your Native Am heritage.  This is a "leader?"
@sharitari10 @GOPSenFinance Why would he - Not real if don't hear - administration are thieves. All of them. Joke!
-George Soros was his Partner.So you will take no money from Mr. Soros and denounce his pact during ur elections?
That's heartbreaking and Congress shouldn't approve him and shame on Trump for nominating a crook.
Mnuchin boasted about saving nearly 100k homes to the foreclosure crisis....can he indicate how many he did NOT?
as he clearly glossed over that.
Pocahontas talking about scams, that right there is funny.
#ImpeachDonaldTrump
Please..... looking for excitement try reading "Clinton Cash".  That's exciting!!  Just say'n
I wanna hear why you didn't have the decency to properly greet Betsy DeVos?
Swamp dwellers.
hey miss Indian giver, why u charge 400k for college speech then say stuff like this? Can't have both ways!
That would require some reservoir of compassion to be tapped, which years of chasing a bottom line have depleted.
I'm assuming someone looked into the specifics with Colleen. Taxes & ins. paid? Reasons for losing it. #mortgage
wow given the corruption in @TheDemocrats !!!
Banks Billions$$$$$. Didn't say it had to be legally obtained.
Well this sucks! GOP not doing its job again? Putting their heads in the sand? All cowards.
of course not.  They don't really care.
they don't care. why is this sham of a trump presidency/cabinet being allowed after knowing RUSSIAN interference?
@quixotehamlet @GOPSenFinance Get a life!
#AllAbtMoney 4 GOP. What's ours is their's, and what's their's is their's. Nothing matters but their wallets.
ah but wasn't it you that got rich off old lady foreclosures?
@SenSchumer Shame Vote no and no on Devos! No for 4 years to an extreme Supreme!
guess Obama is to blame for that one!
she took out the loan? Her problem.
if true. Terrible. Probably #fake
all of the reverse mtg are scams rules the democrats forced on banks your fault lizzy
Hmmm. Care to explain that, @GOPSenFinance? I'll bet not.
this is just the beginning
shame on the #GOP. Thoughts with Miss Colleen. We will fight.
Human interest before corporate interest!!!
Cause to them she doesn't matter! I go cares about old poor people? They are crooks
If they listen they can't keep pretending they don't know #StopNeoNazis #TraitorTrump #SoldUsToTheRussians

that's horrific, we must not give up the fight
i hope not to hear for next 4 years...
image hands over ears ninner ninner I can't hear you
The alligators are filling the swamp.  That should drain it.
Most executives, like most politicians, don’t believe they are responsible for what happens on their watch.
It is increasingly difficult to hold them responsible, if at all.
