Yeah @SenWarren... Who wants judges that will uphold constitutional law? Pocahontas wants judges to write law. @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump
: 1) Not repubs 2) If #SpinelessCongress wn't write or writes bad laws, courts rectify
just like Obamacare. Bad law written by dems. Activist judge changed the law. @SenWarren @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump
: Who was the activist judge? Chief Justice Roberts?
@kathy_tkat 
do you really want trump voting in a crooked judge!
like ACA? "It's not a tax" passes. "Oh it has to be a tax to be constitutional, ok, it's a tax then"
- Hahah! Ya think?
kinda like what Obama does
No they just want to stop activist liberal judges w/ doing away w/ the Constitution. Fake heritage
Hardly. They want judges to uphold the constitution.
you mean that interest called our #Constitution , no wonder you didn't get picked as VP
and what do you want the Justices to bend to? Oh yeh.  Your wishes.  @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump
Like Obama hasn't?  He has stacked the federal courts for the Leftist agenda.
NO, just ones who adhere to our Constitution.
I pray he never gets that opportunity.
No you are so silly. D.T. Will appoint Judges who will follow the constitution.
Hurray. That must mean you think Trump will win.
We need laws holding our politicians accountable, and that just won't happen.
That Dems would accuse Repubs of attempting to bend the judiciary is the height of hypocrisy.
wow that's quite an accusation. Liberal tactics
Dallas Morning News: "Donald Trump is not qualified to be President" -has not endorsed a Dem in 75yrs
Oh Bullshit, judges who do their job without letting politics get in the way don't bend
What the devil is it YOU people do???
Just shut up Pocahontas.
Then they're going to be seriously disappointed when he loses in a landslide.
end the law? Ok Cheek Bones, LOL. Lib judges make law out of lib handbooks.
Craven and anti-Constitution.
Hopefully all those Senators will be available for the Bench next year. Or maybe some job back home.
Hillary taught you well, your as good a LIAR as she is.
Warren is a Freak! The Corrupt Dem Supreme Court Judge that gave Hillary Special Protection! Idiot!
this coming from the same folks that gave Hillary a pass for breaking federal law. Your a joke Dems
you are outright LYING Elizabeth. He want to nominate moderate and right judges.
Sounds like the blind leading the blind. Time for real govt. #ASIB
Sorry Liz, but I have to side with the @SenateGOP on this one...
You're the pot calling the kettle there. LOL
w trumpass the usa will cease to exist so judicial appts wont matter!!!
this country has descended into madness, the GOP needs serious therapy
thank you Sen. Warren for your hard work &dedication to the American people
https://1drv.ms/w/s!AuiU8ltTUW4-nVYZrpnJ_ZGNUiZx â€¦
OMGosh! And Billary doesn't???
ladysusane2 #hey  liz endorsement of a liar, thief, makes. U Too corrupt by association
it could be end of religious freedom as we know it & solidification of corporate controlled america.
It's time for Obama to get tough & appoint one using executive order. Enough is enough. Stop the GOP.
Isn't that exactly what the Dems sure doing, come on Pocahontas!
is it me or do u spend most ur time on Twitter & not doing ur job Pocahontas?
and dems want a centrist right?
Not that HRC would do that. I'm sure she would nominate moderate constitutionalists. Not.
Pocahontas prefers to leave law writing to activist judges instead of doing her job. #LazyDem @SenWarren @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump
#DoYourJob
SICK
We need judges 2 interpret actual words of Constitution, as understood by the generation that wrote/ratified it.
But not if the judges are on Mexican heritage
To @SenWarren Liar liar pants on fire. I think the GOP is more concerned with 2nd Amend, illegal immig, terrorists, etc.
Too bad there won't be near enough GOP votes
Relax! This is nothing new!  When Trump gets elected President, then you can vote.
November they won't until after we elect Hillary and Democrats to replace them.  Vote Democrats
He may turn around and NOMINATE BONDI ? OR The demented ONE
and @HillaryClinton won't? I'm voting for @DrJillStein
other than you bending the laws to suit your agenda.
Some of the recent law changes are simply ridiculous!!!
unlike the unconstitutional gun ban you support and enforce. Your a hypocrite and a thief and a poser
#constitution is what makes US great & binds us together!
You mean just like how the Democrats pushed Obamacare down our throats....????
is this not what @SenateDems and @HillaryClinton want as well? #isnthatthepoint
.
Some of the recent law changes have hurt our country and gotten away from the moral values our founding Father's established
They'll do their job when the dems literally whip their asses in November.
I think you made a mistake u meant liberals bend the law! So silly Senator! Be careful when typing!
and the @SenateGOP thinks we cant see the truth behind their lies. @realDonaldTrump should be nowhere near FDR's chair.
@brackster39 They have dropped their pretense of equality. They want us back to pre-civil war laws.
HAHA YOU should listen to yourself so you know how STUPID you sound!! LMAO!!
Like Democrats and immigration? Gay marriage? Pot laws? @SenWarren @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump
Laws against gay marriage violated the 14th Amendment and were irrational.
 like Hillary would elect anyone any better
when will you be out campaigning for HRC?
nothing new here Sen Warren, but keep "spelling it out" until the public pays attention.
.@SenWarren @SenateGOP Why don't Senate Dems start objecting to ending the "quorum calls" until judge nominations are taken up? #DoYourJob
Just like you if you're so anxious to get them appointed in this administration.
HAHA You're ridiculous you know that? And YOU and HRC are NOT going to do that? What a joke! LMAO!
Oh, another rscist.
They have enough of those ALREADY!!!
Cake eaters & crooks...the whole bunch of them.
It's not happening
you boring Pocahontas
Oh, a racist!
