senator warren...DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT PLLLLLLLLLLEEEEEAAAASE!!!!!
he is breaking so many laws and ethics rules. This has to be addressed
Actually....He's not
5 U.S.C. App. 106(b)(3);5 C.F.R. 2634.605(b)(5)(ii). Yes he is
he is exempt from all conflict of interest
false
Dude. You lost. Grow up and stop hyperventilating.
3 million more American disagree with that statement but that's fine
God forbid we would have a president who is successful in his own right.
It's not success it's that he won't divest or show taxes. Blindly trusting him is dangerous
I understand the theory but Trump is losing money by serving our country, not gaining like others.
if u have a multi-international business in the fam you have A LOT to gain financially by being pres
Anybody who becomes pres stands a lot to gain financially.  He doesn't need the office.
I'd like little more transparency. I love our country & want best for it just like you
@KyleKulinski @realDonaldTrump you should have stood up against the primary fraud that sabotaged Bernie instead of rolling over.
Time to move on--she's not the enemy and we have a bigger target now
she is a tool for the Oligarchy Regime. I'll never trust her again.
Agree to disagree. Luckily Bernicrats swept DNC delegate elections all over so hopefully the party will get fixed bottom up.
You Bernie people need to get over that, now. It's over. It sucks, but it's over. Rebuild the Dem party, don't insult it.
I will never be a democrat ever again. Have fun with your Oligarchy ruled party.
gotta unite otherwise we r doomed to be under GOP rule for a while. Suck it up; let's fight 2gethr!
and there will always people who only like the fun parts and will hate on the work of rebuilding xo
didn't hrc keep telling us djt wasn't  as rich as he says....yet now dems call it "trump empire" lol
From what I've seen, liberal types laugh very little. They're always angry.
Trump thinks Americans are stupid! His ethics plans are only fooling his supporters
love profile picture
you need one maybe one from the march?
why's left get mad at a wht playing a Blk but, don't hold you accountable for playing a Native American?
People Outraged Over A White Man Playing Michael Jackson http://trib.al/uZV9RvU  
Can Pocahontas Warren shut up already??
You are supposed to try and unite the country you are the worst example of an American you need to be fired
Goebbels 30s-propaganda unit preached national unity/utopian future/campaign against Jews/others not part of national unity-Trump
@jacobyoung2017 @realDonaldTrump well, I'm laughing. He just can't help himself.
ummm sorry Pocahontas,the tribe called,you're not native American

can you please focus on facts rather than fiction? I mean, ur supposed to be a senator
hard to focus on facts when he's hiding his taxes
spinning but why is that a concern? Don't ya think if he was doing wrong, the IRS wld have gotten hm
u trust the IRS to keep politicians/rich honest? If nothing to hide release them like all other pres
not all other presidents have but Liz is a public servant too. Does she release annually to us?
Trump has the lowest approval rating as PEEOTUS in recorded history (37%):
same polls that had him losing in a landslide.... #fakenews

yea impeach him, you liberals are gonna love pence.
#dumptrump , America, your only choice is to dump this conman loser.
We are laughing at you for playing the B. You need to work on your public image.
nobody cares, his business plans for USA are not a joke. That's what u should be focused on senator warren.
how about plans for women?


you have abused your position long enough...time for the American People to get their Gov't back... #MAGA 
@realDonaldTrump
Why just "trust" him that he has our backs? Divest and show taxes. Country over politics
others 'divested' and 'shown taxes'...and look what they have done...these are NOT related, unless you are political.
Just because others are corrupt is no reason not to hold him to a high ethical standard.
The joke is on you Liz...hope you're planning a career in something other than politics.
I'm laughing...At you. So superficial.
like yours. How many millions have you made from selling your vote
You are a joke @SenWarren!
This is so untrue. Again you are just causing trouble. Can't wait to vote you out.
oh yeah, I am laughing every morning, just after waking. The good guys won and we will MAGA
what do you base this on? Are you more educated in business than President Trump?
USA laughing at you! Pay attention who the nation elected as POTUS, majority of Senate & House! Wake Up!
YOU Warren are a joke, FAKE Indian, do the DNA test, I'll pay for it? Truth only hurts you!
Seriously y'all are complaining about Trumps finances to a woman worth almost $15mil. Public servant?
You're a joke, and everyone is laughing.
No Pocahontas that is where you are wrong as most everybody is laughing, only they are laughing at YOU
right, not laughing but applauding his sacrifice to the country.
no, we're laughing but we're laughing at you @SenWarren .
Btw thank U for all ur rain dances pocahontas..CA is almost out of drought...  @realDonaldTrump
Pretend Indian - what a disgrace
@MAHAMOSA @realDonaldTrump I'm laughing at you, you could've been VP. #BernieWouldHaveWon
I'm laughing at YOU! Ur a joke pocahontas. Ur a thieve. Got thievery on ur brain. Y U asked Dr Carson those questions today.
EW ~ whine on someone else's dime. DO UR DAMN JOB. COUNTRY B4 self.
Went to school, taught school, became a senator. Never had a real business but will "teach" Trump about business
Liz do something useful.,
Hey Liz... You're the joke... Your Indian name shall be.. Laughing Twatwaffle
you are the joke and we are laughing everytime you have the nerve to bash Trump your jealousy shines through
cry cry babie and the rest of you dopes.
Sure, he could claim to be a native american and make hundreds of thousands teaching a course. Please don't stop,2018 winning
prez exempt from such conflct of interest laws.  Crack a book, ya'ii
I'm glad u know more about business plans than Donald Trump...#saduglybitch
He and his spawn are :(
BIG joke, like the orange  one  himself!!!
Will he be arrested on the 20th when he breaks the law?
I believe that the rhetoric he shoveled in his press conference dies not divest him of his business
At least the American people are getting a lesson in Civics 101
The Constitutional Republic. 
Memba??
Can I get that message in Smoke Signal™ ? Didn't quite catch your meaning from the rambling mess you spewed.
Not true.  Our president-elect is laughing at you.  As am I and about 62mm other Americans.  #maga
show us your tax returns!
but tens of millions still think you're a laugh-riot ...
You're just a little ankle biter for a Party that has become irrelevant. Besides being a liar.
He who lost the popular vote and named himself a new Caesar is a bloated, hot air version of a person.
Everything about this buffoon is a joke.  Unfortunately, it's a bad joke.
Oh, were laughing. Not at Mr. Trump but @ liberals as they implode over Hillary getting her ass kicked. 304-227!
Nobody is acting like you either. We watched Obama tear this nation apart. SO did you. You did NOTHING!
I'm terrified of what this unethical,
uneducated, unqualified, undeserving buffoon will do to our country.
@KyleKulinski @realDonaldTrump Elizabeth is a sellout! She made her choice when she backed corrupt HRC.
@Newyorker2212 @realDonaldTrump then it's up to YOU people to do something about this. We demand the rapist fraud be fired!
they are laughing at you Elizabeth.
agree- Trump needs to divest entirely.
I'm certainly not laughing - quite horrified
#NotMyPresident 
@seanspicer @KellyannePolls @SenateMajLdr
@ThomasB00001 @realDonaldTrump Trump had Russian investments, said Don, Jr. But he won't discuss with his son when he's prez?
Yet he never approved the sale of uranium to them after receiving "donations".
but it is kind of funny that @realDonaldTrump likes getting peed on.
all this talk of an Empire.... #notmypresident #AntiTrump #notmyprez #notmypres #ANTITRUMPMVMT
What is going on with health care. This is what everyone should be focused on now!
Yes we are and it at you HaHaHa
and where are his tax returns already???
's business plans aren't the only joke.  He is a joke and unqualified for the job #TraitorTrump #Smallhands
Why did the media let this dangerous Russian puppet dominate the campaign cycle headlines with his #TrumpLies?
plenty are laughing.  It's just that they're laughing at you but you're too delusional to see it.
no one cares what you think. watch while Dodd-Frank goes bye bye also...keep talking though, you're good at that
and we are caught in this nightmare
Trump once said that Obama's CIA is plotting schemes against Russian diplomats. see the tweet below
https://twitter.com/PSJCommunity/status/815876759115677696 …
Drag him Elizabeth
Nobody but the Russians. Trump is so indebted to them, he will truly be Putin's puppet. He has no choice.
Actually, I think TRUMPKING has a plan for the empire: corps plunder commons, Putin gets his $1.4T.
I'm laughing at you. You rail against the next POTUS for using twitter tet you attack him in tweets non stop
yes we are at you and the Democrats u had 8 yrs and u tore the country apart Trump build it back
impeachment for taking monies from foreign governments counts for your businesses too.Do the right thing! Ethics
@DavidKoechner @realDonaldTrump  the people want term limits, let the mandate be recognized #draintheswamp #recallwarren
@DavidKoechner @realDonaldTrump It's true, he's not laughing. To be fair though he works for Senator Warren.
@KyleKulinski @realDonaldTrump 
I don't know about that, the nihilist looks  like they are having a good time from the absurd.
Donald is a joke never saw a president act so disgraceful . And so unloyal to the American people.
@casatino Thankyou Senator Warren. Keep fighting the good fight. We need you!
Please, @SenWarren, fight for all of us. Signed, Mass. resident.
.@realDonaldTrump’s business plans for the Trump empire are a joke. Only nobody is laughing.
No. We're not & pretty soon neither will some of these other morons screaming about Bernie or lib crybabies.
You chicka are the joke. GO home Pochahantas nobody gives two flying arrows what you think
Donald Trump is a joke!! He is not fit to run our Country! I am VERY sad for all of us....
I'm  laughing at U Liz. U CRAZY Socialist Kook
Thus saith the establishment poser
We're laughing at you Pocahontas! 
Nor is anyone doing anything. So he gets away with it
@TinaMorphis @realDonaldTrump ...except the Trumps...
@OolonColluphids @realDonaldTrump and Tillerson? The press conference?
@TinaMorphis @realDonaldTrump then the question is Elizabeth (& I love your style) but what is going to be done about it legally?
Crying and pulling out our hair, alternatingly.
Please do what you can to muzzle this man child. Have the ethics committee investigate his collusion with Putin.
@transition2017 help us out because there are misinformed puppet lawyers who need definition: how do you define emoluments?
here are copies of Trump's divestment plan:
I'm scared.
We were all well aware he had an empire when we elected him and didn't expect him to throw it away!
@lovebscott @realDonaldTrump. How are they a joke? Wise planning brings success!
It's a "peek-a-boo trust". Still not laughing.
We are laughing at YOU and Clinton! Both big LOSERS!
Indeed. Please do not let this go. The conflicts of interest issue is very concerning to the integrity of the US
please stop bringing your children with you everywhere you go and to all govt meetings. They were not elected
You are the joke except you are not funny. You are trying to run for pres already!
What you see is what you get...a child with no moral compass...who fills his own ego with his own compliments. And a traitor. NMP
everyone is laughing at you, @SenWarren
if you selfish bickering politicians would shut up about each other for one minute it would be awesome
@randyprine @realDonaldTrump   But no one questioning
And we count on you to follow through, senator
how would he not know if his kids lost billions in less than 8 years. that would be the lead on every paper.
I'd be less nervous if I saw taxes - now especially. I don't buy the allegations yet, but need proof either way.
What are we waiting for before we take legal action to save our country?


I'm not a reporter and I still want to see his taxes.  He feels he is above the law.  He will abuse the office
AND nobody's DOING anything about it!
is anybody going to actually do anything to stop him?
The Trumps are all laughing - all the way too the bank.  At our nation's expense. #TrumpLies #resist
no1 made bush or Cheney sell their co.no1 made Kennedy sell their holdings I think ur jealous of trump
Oh, some are laughing,but they're laughing at you. Dems haven't been this upset since Lincoln freed the slaves.
I'm not a reporter and I want to see Trump's tax returns to assess how he is compromised & not conflicted
so very unethical but tells me legislators lack guts or teeth
- I'm laughing. I think you're hilarious.
u guys are really waiting for JESUS come &save us Coming from southamerica this look like Venezuela Chavez times.lets divide
We are laughing at his fondness for being peed on, though!
Have you read them??
we hope that you and other Senators will consider impeachment asap
, thank you. It's time to #divestdonald
soldiers sacrifice their lives to serve their country. PEOTUS refuses to sacrifice a few $$ to serve. Sad.#DivestDonald
Are you f'n kidding me? He banished himself from his multi-billion $ organization and will accept $1 salary.
you are kidding yourself (i.e. getting duped). He only stepped away from daily mngemnt. Still getting profits from TO
Stop him I'm sure there is a way to stop him he is a disgrace and embarrassment to this country
I am laughing but I am not Nobody and I see in your picture Elizabeth that you are smiling.
You're jealous aren't you. Flip a few more houses in AZ or NM and you'll be fine
Be honest Sen Warren.
he needs to be stopped before he starts
#TrumpIsTraitor #LockTrumpUp
@SudySAS @realDonaldTrump no I'm not! What about the blind trust? He must put all in blind trust! This admin is already a joke!
 #DoSomething Now!There is a cancer heading for the WH!This is a priority!Everything else on hold!@coton_luver @realDonaldTrump
It's a game of chicken. He's throwing a red line & if he gains an inch, he's going 4 the mile. So lawyers only option. Implement
his supporters are laughing.They believe everything he says.
Seriously, we are counting on you, Senator Warren.
Go get 'em, Liz!
@coton_luver @realDonaldTrump
No, he throws them behind his bully pulpit & with his pen and phone. Nice safety pin
@MermaidJKL @realDonaldTrump I'm sure the laughter is echoing in the halls of Trump Tower!
Ur a joke, along with Pelosi, and Schumer, and we r all laughing at all of u, for acting so childish.

We can only surmise you are pro #podesta pro #pedophile pro #nwo pro #microchipping Right sellout?
@PrincessBravato @realDonaldTrump dt plans reflect him. Afraid. Bully. He who wants to be king. He now needs a Clownbus not car
Sen Warren, challenge him all the way. Breaks all ethical rules.
At least Trump believes only vaccines should be in #vaccines
