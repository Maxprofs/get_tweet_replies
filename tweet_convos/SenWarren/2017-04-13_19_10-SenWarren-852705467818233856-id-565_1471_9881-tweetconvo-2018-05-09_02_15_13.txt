You are just about the only Senator with a happy Town Hall crowd! My Senator!
Yes, she panders to everyone
Not true. You obviously don't know her. You may disagree with her, but she has her own mind and certainly does not pander.
It doesn't take much to figure out she panders
Give me something specific.
Here, a video of her, pretty specific..

This is not normal!
Just took a look at your feed.  Your batshit crazy.  You need help.  You really need to seek assistance.
Have a good night.
I hope you have a blessed life.
Has Warren found proof of her heritage beyond a photo of her grandfather with high cheek bones?
And this is important to you because.......
Just like seeing Trumps tax returns is important to some idiots
More important important things to worry about! Shows their priorities
You paid for a jubilant crowd!  How much did it set you back?  400k?
Soros paid for it

Liz, talk about Unions, please! Having hard time convincing coworkers to vote Dem when Dems don't show support for us.
Daniel, Dems don't support white males anymore. Didn't you see the DNC chair speeches?
Still a better choice when Republicans actively work to destroy unions.
Please explain the good that unions do anymore? They aren't the same as they once were. Most are just political machines, not anything else
That's a great corporate talking point and nothing else.
Not sure why you felt you needed to tell me who are in unions. My point was still valid.
Glad we have people like you fighting for what's right! We need more people like you and Sen Sanders
2020 campaign has come pretty early this time around, huh??
Shouldn't she repay the salary she obtained under false circumstances?
I live in North Carolina.  I would welcome you as my senator.  It would be a welcome change from @SenatorBurr and @Senator Tillett.

Median Annual Salary by Gender for @SenWarren Staff in 2016

Men: $73,750 
Women: $52,750…
stupid ppl if they r happy or they r Dems that create the VIOLENCE @ the GOP meetings! We know u pay them 2 b there Indian girl
You fight for no one but yoursrlf. Which is why you lied about being native American. ... so as to benefit you. You are a sick individual.
Good Job!..If Dems keep up This Momentum! Upper and Lower Chambers of The Congress, Will Be Dominated, By Dems By Mid-Term! Point-blank!
Lol lol lol
You lookem heap big mad!
Your townhalls are not erupting in anger?Funny how if you work for people instead of Corp interest you get support. GOP could learn from you
See the people that do work for the people, they're the ones winning elections.
I bet all those Republican senators who've had contentious town hall meetings of late, are all gnashing their teeth while reading this!
Wow, maybe 200 people. Your friend Hilary will be jealous!
Panderer who lied about her race and just called half of Americans racist. What a loser and whacko
A review of this photo reveals a lack of diversity within the crowd!Hmmm
Great sen Warren did you talk about how Trump only won because his voters are all racist? You are a discrace to America. You are despicable!
100% Hypocrite! Elizabeth Warren is a multimillionaire public parasite on the working class.
We love what you do for us, Senator Warren.So proud of our senator!
If you want an education then u pay 4 it. Not working 4 someone else, and you are a hypocrite, what did u get PD 4 teaching 1 class! Liar 
Your comments show a total lack of knowledge about Senator Warren; look at Wikipedia instead of hate-spewing venom
She lied about being an Indian. And pays female staffers less. She's a hippocrite
Looks like a presidential rally.
Please let her try that!! Guaranteed a republican win!
I love how most of the Dems who have had town halls recently r being greeted with cheers,not jeers, unlike our Repub friends,& THEIR reps.
Even though they are sure trying to pay their way into winning one! Lol how much outside money for ossoff and he still didn't win it
Bring those greedy Republican bastards to their knees, beat the hell out of their knee caps how about that, then take away their healthcare
Where is the peace pipe?  Did you smoke the peace pipe with your followers????
Vote this fraud out!!
Whoever you are, this is a non-issue but it stirs up your venom I see
It should be the issue because she's a liar just like Hillary & if you don't like it why in hell did you comment on it. 
IfUdon'tlikeIt2bad
You go Liz! #FightLikeASquirrel
Thank you for all you do for the American public. Its a welcome change to find a politician who actually CARES! ..AND WHO IS HONEST!
I see how motavated the crowd looks. 7 people on their phones How about an adgenda to further uniting behind open boarders and higher taxs?
What r u going to do abt all these great women losing their jobs? #sallyyates #marymccord
Same thing she always does.  Whine.  Other than that, not a damned thing.
Your town halls are pleasant because Obama, Jarrett, Holder aren't sending the "trained group" of angry voters to them! It's ALL Staged!
Thank you for always listening and fighting for your constituents! @GOP now THIS is how town halls are supposed to be conducted! #RESISTANCE
Too bad I can't be debating you I run you out of town expose your lies
Dam devil....
what a joke! You're fighting for the progressive status quo & your deranged world view that have zero to do w/ what's good for America!
Stay strong and be the leader we need you to be! We need you and more like you now more than ever!
Thankful for Senator Warrens idiotic rhetoric. Keep tearing down the libs every time you speak. Stupid senator squaw warren. THANK YOU!! :)
Warren yo disgust me trying to blame this election on racism, how dare you!
Democrats sent our jobs overseas or to Mexico. Then you want $15 for fast food jobs that is for high school or college students. How dumb
She looks and sounds like Hillary
You are fighting for the destruction of America
I wish you would've gotten boooed like the republicans. But I guess Soros is getting his monies worth with you.
Hope you enjoyed it! Majority of MA no longer feels the need to vote for your re-election!
U r a FRAUD.Did u tell them how much MONEY you charge4 your classes or speeches? That 4 kids could pay off their whole tuitition with that?
Congress must add the words American citizen 2 our constitutional law.  Word used by founding fathers was all, assuming we R all Americans.
Lol. Look at that tiny crowd. You need to learn about TRUMP sized crowds!!
The Democratic party has taken us down a road where we are second to all other countries.  A place where our Constitution is used against us
We are not a country of racists, we are a country of patriots.  We have 2 recognize when our broad shoulders R bent, our values challenged.
You run your mouth. Your a hater. Trump this Trump that. You so weak u deflect. No evidence of Russia, racist. Very sad how you spread  lies
I don't want a country that has so little self control that we are 20 Trillion in debt and still calling "send us your tired, weak and poor"
I don't want a country that is so open, that I have to press two for English.  There has to be a balance between benevolence & sacrifice.
Democratic voters have no more value 2 the Democratic Party than a warm body.  You can B illegal, criminal, or anti-American, just vote Dem
Mexico is soon to have an election. They have openly welcomed back refugees, simply 4 their vote. Same voting mentality used by Democrats.
ICE could have arrested at least 50 at the event. The BS coming out of her mouth disgusting. Embarrassing!
We can't preserve the American dream, unless we preserve America.  Globalism, will not preserve our country nor our values.  Distortion.
America is special, we have special freedoms & space, not common 2 any other country.  We R a world magnet, but America 1st or all is lost.
Democratic resistance 2 the wall, is just the start to "One America".  Attempts tp desensitize Americans to an open border, loss of country
8 years ago, I read that there R "those" who want 2 join North & South 
America, one America.  Imagine, Colombian drugs& Juarez violence?
Democrats continue 2 label Republicans as something ugly, because we want 2 take back ou country from globalism. We can't lose our identity.
So what you're saying is REPUBLICANS WEREN'T PAID BY THE REPUBLICAN ELITE TO DISRUPT YOUR TOWN HALL! Repubs are good, decent ppl! 
By Schumers' standard, interest & a gov guaranteed loan, were not incentive enough?  He also thinks that doctors should receive full fee.
How about fighting for veterans and Americans in every state.
@POTUS pocahontas what the hell are you talking about you have done nothing in massachusetts you are just another dirt bag politician
Racism is why Trump won, guess your running out of facts, lowering yourself to such ignorant comments! Guess educated people arent smart!
NASTY WOMEN WORK IT, ALL THE WAY TO IMPEACHMENT OF TRAITOR TRUMP.
Plz stop legitimizing Trump's campaign rhetoric w/this notion that he spoke the language of the poor. The facts say otherwise. @charlierose
I wish i lived in your district   they are lucky to have you and so are the rest of us!
I am with you, Senator Warren... I am ready to fight!!!
U need to stop whining and do ur dam job that's what we pay u for
Arent you glad Republicans don't show their a** at your meetings like the libs do at republican meetings
Pocahontas!! You need to do better.

You are one of my Heroes Thank you for all that you do 
What have you done for us? But complain
Thanks for coming to NY as well! As a jewelry company that's made in NYC, we are so supportive of your work!
Oh are you on trial as a witch?
I wish you represented Missouri. Lucky Mass.
DID YOU ANSWER WHY YOU LIED ABOUT BEING AN INDIAN AND PAYING LESS FOR YOUR WOMAN WORKERS?????  LIAR
Millions are facing starvation in South Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria and Yemen. Please help. Send aid. #4Famines #UNICEF #OXFAM #FoodInsecurity
Pochahonus u are a liar.  What jobs have u created for the families in ur state?  0 that is 0.  How many jobs did u kill with ur policies
Please don't fight anymore.  U are destroying families.  Just retire and do us a favor.  Us families cant afford you anymore. Liar and loser
Don't you think a senator should be undivided in their attentions to the people ... NOT WRITTING OPPURTINISTIC BOOKS FOR FLOCK COMSUMPTION
This is truly a moron at work.
the only thing you're fighting for is a bigger checking account balance
How about less fighting and more attempts to compromise with your Red colleagues 2 end Obamacare replace it and implement tax cuts & reform
I always wonder when I hear politicians say they are " fighting" for their constituents.
Why not tell the truth.  Only thing your fighting for is to promote yourself.  When things don't go your way, you whine.  Grow up.
You've done more to better yourself & worsen America than you have for any family in MA or elsewhere. Truth Doesn't Matter to Never-Trumpers
and how much did you charge at the door?
Twisting more minds and creating more divisiveness as if you are Satan in a pink vagina hat and we know your also Nasty!!
she doesn't care you're absolutely right she could care less. Meijer Warren
#Poop 

#Berkley
Have any Mass. Homeowners been able to get their homes back or have we forgotten already?
assure folks @SenSanders will do cabinet picks you'd  hv little difficulty w/rank & file @GOP u saw #WVA they'd hv voted 4 #bernie not trump
If the election becomes invalid then @HillaryClinton becomes president, right bc the election is fraudulent. I reckon if u make Clinton prez

You are the real thing, Elizabeth, a.k.a the next President of the U.S.!

Yeah you're a real "fighter"
Just watched your interview.  A truly lovely lady that I would vote for!  MA we need to keep her in Senate.
What's your take on equal pay for woman?  Practice what you preach.
Did anyone ask you about your Native American roots?
You should be fired. Part of draining the swamp
#ElizabethWarrenforPresident
Ever think maybe 67 million people don't want your version of America in their future???
Thank you,Senator Warren.
Nice lookin wigwam you got there Pocahontas.
U R not likeable. Always anti America liberals gone off deep end no common sense.
Oh, that's right, re-election is coming up soon.  gotta hit the campaign trail.  good luck. You'll need it:)
You worth 15 million in senator's salary; only one you are fighting for is you!!!!
Your following of liberal clones will not get you re elected Pocahontas. Let's see your taxes, portfolio and homes you own.
She's REALLY fighting AGAINST @POTUS more But In 2015, yes ,2015  TRUMP Primary  MA Elec...@RepGeoffDiehl fought for us more!
Fighting for what exactly?
This is someone who represents their constituents
God I wish you were my Senator!!!
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
http://www.tmn.today/2017/02/elizabeth-warrens-9-biggest-lies/4/ ….
More people there than at tRump's inauguration.
Not a very diverse crowd?
Amazing so many in Mass so stupid to believe anything a liar like you would say. #dumbmass
Please do.
It's nice how you got ahead by lying
You only fight for trial lawyers and bureaucrats.  What a joke.  From a family of union workers & you don't have a clue.
Cost too high? Rmember when YOU got paid 350 k to teach one class?
You rip off the students , then blame Obama's loan plans .
It went so smoothly because your fellow liberal cheerleaders were there. They show their asses at Republican town halls. Hateful liberals!
MA, the women you underpay, & all of  want you gone!  You are a deceitful person!  3/4 of your likes & replies are fake accts!
PLEASE Mrs. Warren get that so called President... to reveal his taxes, he is a traitor to our country
Thank you for what? @SenWarren has only Sponsored 1 bill--POW Rememberance Act of 2015. How has she made your life better? She's a fraud
Wish you were my Senator!
Be careful  there Know for Witch Hunts.
I wonder how you fight for them, seems like you are always fighting w/your colleagues.
Fight trump.  He is taking us to war!
Did you tell them that you made $500,000 for teaching one class?
Oh stop already lizzy you not fighting for anybody in Massachusetts but yourself are you serious do you think everyone in Ma. Is stupid geez
That's because they don't send out emails for you like they do the Republicans to go and get in the face. no wonder it was a nice town hall
You are fighting for your own agenda surely your people aren't that ignorant??
Filled with liberals.  Wouldn't want to be there.
How does grandstanding against @realDonaldTrump and not doing a damn thing for MA held families?
Now this is a senator who actually serves her constituents. Stuck with "Sell Your Soul Portman" here in Ohio. Zero open town halls for him!
I am working tirelessly to make sure you do not get reelected!! Your all talk no action!! No accomplishments???
small in audience participation, we all know your numbers are falling like yoyr fakeness and lies
You're not fighting for anyone but yourself. Bet people wanted to know why you pay females less money than male counterparts. lol
What I only see 10 people. No one likes Liz anymore.
They pick things to fight for but they don't fix them.  Poor policies insure people need to be fougjht for come election time.  Liars to all
George found us. Can U? Joe & Jo-Ann
I hope the people of Massachusetts are not stupid enough to put you back in office.  Does anyone with a brain want Socialism in the USA?
Are you fighting for equal pay? Just outside of your organization of course
a real Senator who works for the benefit of PEOPLE #ResistTrump #nextPOTUS
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity Yes Lizzy, You Do Indeed belong In Salem. See any Ancestors yet? Did you fly in on a Broom?
Lying some more huh? #FakeBase #LibDems
Thanks for all you do! Loved seeing you with Bernie in Boston talking sense to people! Time for term limits and Public funding of elections!
Equal pay!!! Oh wait... #hypocrite
