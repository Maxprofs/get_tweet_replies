Thank you Senator Warren.  You absolutely rock!!!
Why is no one caring about California's Suicide Expansion to Mentally ill? Started that Way in Netherlands Now even Children...
DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE BUT TO BE MURDERED BY EUPHANASIA WHEN THEY HAVE MENTAL DISORDERS. IT STARTS OUT JUST THE TERMINALLY ILL THEN
THEN THE NETHERLANDS LIE AND SAY NINE YEAR OLD CHILDREN ASK THEM TO DIE BECAUSE HE GOT AUTISM. NOW IT IS NORMAL TO PUT SOMEONE UP
EUTHANASIA NO CHOICE THEY MAKE THEM DIE AND TELL THEM THEIR ORGANS' WILL BE HARVESTED SO DO NOT FEEL BAD WE ARE MAKING YOU DIE!
Affordable healthcare...NO. Keep my Dr......NO. Read it to find out what's in it. Yr a joke
they need to share burdensome costs of ACA?
keep up the awesome work!
I cannot wait until your super hyped bias horse-shit.  How much are you getting from the DNC?  Keep fighting the fake fight......
#SickHillary
You must learn to love Donald J. Trump, but you will respect him once elected. #BasketOfDeplorables
US needs to have system like UK, Canada, Japan, France! Single payer! To hell with  thieving insurance co's!
I'm losing my very, VERY good BCBS health policy (and doctor), each I've had for 12 years, thanks to the OCare disaster, period.
ur irrelevant now!!!! U had ur 15 minutes now go away into the wind Pocahontas
I was hoping for a slow death of these corps, never thought suicide was their plan. $1b bet called by the DOJ. Give'em hell.
Aetna knows what they are doing. They are manipulating this situation. Know ACA needs them, have placed DOJ in tough position!
Read my lips. No Hillary Clinton for president. She's a lying untrustworthy scandalous politician. And your no better!!
when are you going to get back under Trump's skin? I'm waiting impatiently.
"CrookaHontas" @SenWarren is laughing at how gullible Americans are to think her @CFPB protects citizens.
It protects her Bank Donors ONLY!
Your Efforts for Consumer Protection Bureau caught Wells Fargo massive burglary/Fines $184 miilion.

@GovMikeHuckabee @GovernorPerry @GovWalker Hillary & Obama give 150 billion gift to terrorist
thank for all the work you do! This is important and complex, thank you all!
I think all states should have the Medicaid expansion!!!

Thank you, Senator.
Excellent! Aetna's trying to blackmail the Administration.
Thank you. Next step "Medicare for ALL"
Thank you
Had Atena they refused to pay for my treatments gave me the run around no supervisors were available dr said worst ins ever
Why is it the millionaires like Warren, Clinton, and Bernie that scream the loudest re: income inequality?
Have it cover basic meds.
Awesome  Do you think they'll answer? Probably not 
THANK YOU, for pursuing this!  Lots of back door things going on in healthcare now.  They are taking advantage of ACA...
don't forget Anthem/Cigna acquisition :) Maybe we should let them all conglomerate to one then nationalize them. ? Nat'l Health!
Is blackmailing Justice a criminal offense?  AETNA too clever by 100%!  Congrats AETNA, you win the hubris award today!
Copy of the letter below @SenWarren
now that's funny.. I don't care who ya are
This is a big opportunity for a lean competitor to blow these monopoly minded behemoths out of the top spot & inspire American HC @SenWarren
oh they won't be able to sleep at night worrying about you
Screw that, just Institute Single Payer and Allow Medicare to Negotiate Drug Price like in Free Countries.!
@aetna medicare is suddenly not covering a lot of meds and or cutting amount so meds not even enough 4 one full month. 3 x's
Thank you @SenWarren. No Republican is doing this. Senate Dems look out for middle class. Gop looks to fill their pockets
The only solution to #health #insurance co.s holding #Americans hostage, is to put 'em out of business, as #Canada did 60 yrs ago
#ObamaCare sucks A$$ we demand #UniversalHealthCare for all as a #HumanRight-democrats are #DisgustingPigs #JillNotHill
There will be a point when the increases in health insurance costs vs  benefits become impractical to most Am. with static wages
thank you for your leadership!
thanks for the information.
thank you very much
Thank you, Sen. Warren.  Stay on this!!
And @realDonaldTrump & his rich friends want LESS regulations that would allow these transactions against the public good!
greed
Please close loophole that let my ins. change my plan to deny coverage when I go to my long-time doctors. #dangerous #badmedicine
Excellent! @davidsirota has been the ONLY voice on this for too long!  Glad to see one of my favorite lawmakers jumping on board!
thank you Senator Warren!
wildly profitable insurance companies picking and choosing their markets is a sham. Go Universal and put em outta business
LizzyWa, you're ON IT. Don't let those gouging cowards at Aetna get away with it!
is any one surprised an insurance company would do something to hurt consumers? No I. Reference Flood insurance providers if keen
Thank you Senator Warren. Hope to see you in Presidential race one day.
Liz, Write a letter to #Obama #POTUS to #FullRepeal #ObamaCare. #Tatiana
what's going to take the place of ACA.
thank you!! About time somebody got this going. What they did was criminal (or should be)
don't worry about little Mark. He lives in a right wing echo chamber.
Thank you
