That is exactly what he's been doing the last 7 days? Give him atleast a month? You don't speak for all America?
NO WAY waiting a month. @realDonaldTrump is undermining and breaking our Constituiton. He is more unpopular now.
please explain how he's breaking our constitution? Please elaborate! Watch MSNBC lately? Don't
I think you are too young to be so dismissive of those you disagree with. Grow up or shut up.
how was your's any different? It's impossible to agree with you! We won the election. 
pls understand, trump didn't win the popular vote & making independent decisions on > 49%.
Sunshine, please read the Election rules agreed to by all parties! Donald J Trump is your President!
LOL
we will fight E. Warren in New England and in Washington. We will fight E. Warren The anti American fake Indian
.@SenWarren how exactly did our "core values" become the world's refugees r  entitled to come here? don't see that mentioned in Constitution
@laragoza1 @SenWarren she's off her bipolar meds. She's out in 2018 anyway. Her ranting is getting old
she really is crazy u can see it in her eyes
menopause did not treat her well
@kerybinks @realDonaldTrump kindly follow back
Is not National Security one of our core values, Senator?
@PorterLager @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump you better buckle up for non-stop #bitching because we are never going to stop!
If you used common sense & could understand that change from what we had is a great thing, but Liberals lack common sense so keep bitching
"Common sense" is what most people would agree on. Politics is not that.
Oh but Adam common sense are police to everything in life is a win! Even politics
whatever makes you sleep at night.
I am like Trump.... I don't
that explains your neurosis. Sleep can do wonders for your mental health. I recommend it.
as much as Trump is going nuts @SenWarren complaining doesn't help, real change is working together
Oh yeah, he is really working "together" & he is for "all americans". Nothing but standing in BS. @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
I may not agree with him, but screaming/rioting is not the solution. There are better ways
I don't think U realize the more @GOPSenMajority doesn't listen 2 THE majority, it will get worse. I've been here B4
yet you keep supporting his cabinet picks?
zing
is  xenophobic racist who doesn't want to address that America's has #Whiteextremistterrorists  like Dylan Roof
maybe that's because #WhiteExtremistTerrorists are part of his base voters / FBI's list of terrorist
for some reason I don't see #whiteextremistterrorists hashtag catching on.  
They're now called Alt Right.
so Chuck Schumer not to long ago due to Paris talked about a possible refugee ban-his is ok but not Trumps
he won't listen to you.
- No American should listen to liar @SenWarren #Pocahontas
Tweet away dumbass. I won't see your moronics tweets. Loser. Really, you are a loser. Yes you are. LOSER!!
- Hillary Clinton is loser. Pocahontas @senwarren will lose if she runs against @realdonaldtrump in 2020.
what can we do to make this better? How can we help you?
stand behind president Trump that's what America needs to do
he is making poor, scary choices that impact me. So I will not.
: Exactly how is a more rigorous vetting of refugees a scary choice for you?
when someone makes sweeping assumptions about an entire group of people, scary
:The alternative is to be like Germany or Sweden or France...just let anyone in ?
yes and we shouldn't do that
False dilemma. Google it. We're turning away refugees. Women. Children. Families.
He only listens if it's presented to him in a way that shows that he PERSONALLY will benefit from it
please oppose all the nominees! none are qualified or humane enough to lead those agencies. We need your courage to do this.
resist....to get outvoted.
WARREN CLAIMS SHE'S STILL NATIVE AMERICAN SO SHE CAN GET 0% LOANS WHILE YOU SUFFER!
stop complaining and start offering solutions,,,, you cry and argue with no solutions besides cfpb, a failed regulatory board
Fuck this. Impeach him.
did you call out Schumer when he talked about a possible  refugee pause l during Paris attacks
. @SenWarren for president in 2020
what the hell do something.he is a mental case. Get the rest of the demos together IMPEACH HIM
she's a Senator, she can't.  
If you read the order it's clear. He is in violation, he is unconstitutional. #impeachNow!!!
RUN FOR PRESIDENT...please
You are part of the problem. @The_Dudette_5 @realDonaldTrump
hell hea trying to protect us
Why would he care about America's core values?  It's not on his radar
Do not remind this executive order
you can't urge.. you have no real voice, you gave it up when you decided disrupt democracy and the Constitution
NO. You don't speak for Americans. You lost.
Warren's Constitution - Bill Clinton 1995 State of the Union immigration https://youtu.be/m3yesvvYEvs  via @YouTube
You can't condemn the same thing as you defend in the same sentence.
yes, you can dawn. let me put it in terms you will understand: 'love the sinner, hate the sin'
President Trump is defending American citizens
DEMOCRATS abandoned MEMBER BASE still believe in: Family & Creator's given Rights & Values. It's too late.
Yea because we want MORE OF THIS in our country!!
oh my. She's on a "warpath"
Senator Warren, YOU are not who we are. #disgrace
POTUS has American values just right. Protect citizens.  Would you and Hillary go away please.
That's exactly what he's doing. It's 90 days Senator Warren. You should be busy working on immigration policies.
How many dead Americans will it take to satisfy your liberal sensitivity?! #LiberalsAreTerrorists #MAGA
Where were you when Obama did this? You and Sanders are hacks.
LIz Warren: quack quack yack yack blah blah. Give me your money.
Everyone else: no
I urge you to find a new career!
it's ok for Warren when Obama drops 100000 bombs drone strikes people and has Muslim ban 2011. Warren = corript.
What is wrong with trump?  Bannon?
he is beyond be urged to be normal. He's not. He's sick push for him to resign. Or impeach.
@POTUS @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews The rust belt loves you @SenWarren! Thanks for voicing our concerns..sign me up never. #RUSTBELT
With the Repuglicans wimping out, I can get away with anything. Get used to it.
I say protect us Trump from terrorist with the ban. Warren needs to stand by the president instead of illegals.
I urge you Senator..... move to the South Pole.
Thanks @SenWarren, @potus is off his rocker already
That is only your opinion.
Are you completely delusional? Or just plain ignorant?
He is protecting Americans! always up for a protest no matter if it hurts Americans as long as it promotes you
Hate and fear will never dominate.  It may distract for a moment, but love will always win out.
did you URGE President Obama when he did it in 2011 for six months instead of the 4 that Trump is asking for
Our core values as Americans are to ignore threats to Nat'l Security? UnAmerican! @DeptofDefense , @potus, @MadDogMattis
oh my GOD.  GOD HELP AMERICA PLEASE!!!
Rescind or impeach....which shall you choose?
rescind your attacks on legal gun owners in MA!  You're no different than him!
this lady it as crooked as they get!! Don't listen stand your ground. We're tired of your liberal BS.
IMPEACH
This is no longer sufficient @SenWarren, the @realDonaldTrump regime is a clear and present danger to the Constitution. #StopPresidentBannon


Rescinding not enuff. Impeach for high crimes and misdemeanors. Can't ignore courts. Fight like hell or democracy will go down.
smoke screen. Coup by Russians, FBI. Trump give up tax info and divest! Russian coup to implode US from within.
he won't don't you see he's a megalomaniac dictator wannabe he's scum and devises us more each day
- #SteveBannon on  #NationalSecurityCouncil is dangerous! Get him off NOW!
How's he gonna be a despotic fascist dictator if he follows that advice? @SenWarren @NoGOPNo @realDonaldTrump
pay your taxes. #Pocahontas
Why did you vote yes to Tillerson??? Wtf???
@aliciac247 @realDonaldTrump very disappointed you had a chance to vote no confirmation hearing voted to confirm. U are not the 1
real core values? Do you mean like lying about being Native American?

He is protecting our national security. Something your rhetoric and fear-mongering has never done.
is a scared child who wet his pants on a playground because he's scared of other kids.
we just want Trump to #Resign before is too late!
That's what the President did' ! Time to support the People who supported our President!
You can not rationalize to a sociopath. Instead of trying to appeal to morals and compassion he in incapable of. HOW DO WE STOP HIM!!!!!
Ur so ignorant. He is protecting our National Security. U r embracing the attacks on US soil by Radical illegals
Rather than a fake Indian, perhaps you should claim to be a fake Mexican, or Muslim, to further your agenda!
You need to be arrested for inciting a riot. You're not a senator, you're just a liar and a fraud. You lie more than the Clintons
senator warren needs to go.
this is our core values - to protect our citizens from terrorist
Cherry picking , Senator?
won't happen!!
u didn't care Lizzy, that Christians didn't get refugee status, u never protested that fact
she did nothing she sat on her hands & allowed Christian genocide she didn't protest http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2016/november/judge-rebukes-obama-over-lack-of-christian-refugees-nbsp â€¦
HOW ABOUT YOU TRAITORS TO THE CONSTITUTION RESIGN... THE FOUNDERS WARNED AMERICA OF YOU TYPES...
the piece of shit Ted Kennedy reinstated immigration because Democrats had minimal voters and we're losing them
he is dumb butt.  He is putting us first for a change. Liz. You want be elected next time lol
These policies fully support our America's core values of responsible immigration not just open the flood gates. How did u ever get elected?
OUR core values are AMERICA FIRST. The Muslim ban does protect our Natl Security.
He just did, where have you been?
American values call for HONESTY among politicians- something you lack
Our great President IS trying to protect our ntl security,u have no idea who these ppl coming in r w/o vetting
if only he could ban fake native Americans
, this is racism
You don't care about National Security.  Laughable!
@chantalclaret @realDonaldTrump no more urging, demanding.If Dems aren't devising a strike back we'll replacing 2 parties 2018.
well I for one do not condone raping and beating of women, mutilation of little girls and beheadings - ANYWHERE
More leadership than this, please. You have moral authority and courage. Let's see it in action.
American Values are what the forefathers placed and by no means reflect absolute tolerance. Contingencies exist
u want to destroy US from within, dear you are the real Trojan horse of our country
.@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump his title is President of the United States now.
Such disrespect for the Election and The Republic.
.@POTUS
Impeach Trump? Has he committed a crime as POTUS? No.  So much for impeachment.  Try again.
@AGirlHasNoPres @realDonaldTrump you know he doesn't have one rational bone in his body, right?
This EO upholds current legislation, "senator". I'd think you'd be aware of that
it's time trump resigned...i have zero respect for him as a human.  he makes bush 2 look good
Your NUMBER ONE JOB IS TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN CITIZENS NOT SOME Foreign ENEMY SO BE PREPARED FOR AN ARREST YOU COMMITTED TREASON
Protect National Security! That's exactly what he's trying to do!
fight, he does bot listen!!!!!
not..sorry typo:)
he is thinking of our national security!
Cool your bu-s lady and take your Valium before you go into a catatonic fit. Your core values r not our values
this is an OUTRAGE!!! What can average citizens do?
I urge YOU to remember all of the victims of Islamic Terror and support better vetting policies. @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
Lizzy take the gloves off and stop being nice.
he is!!!
I hope you and your fellow legislators can condemn his executive orders.
put Bannon on the National Security Council Impeach him now People will die because of him if he is not removed.
Why did you vote for Ben Carson's appointment ? What are you actually doing to resist Trump besides tweeting?
and I URGE #DonaldTrump #POTUS to investigate your finances
He is! The constitution is being enforced something that democrats don't believe in!
Get a grip. Look at what has happened ..how easy radicalized Muslims show up next-door to u with a bomb strapped to them wake up!
@jmknieriem @realDonaldTrump Too late, his constitutional literacy would require him to be literate, & interested in constitution
i urge @SenWarren to act American and stick to American values that  @POTUS is enforcing. #AMERICA1ST
@Chosen_Elephant @realDonaldTrump Senator Warren, I fear you need to turn this into a Dr Seuss rhyme for POTUS to understand
thank you! 
Are you for real?
He will never do it-so what good does urging him do? His main purpose seems to be to inflict pain on liberals
he only cares about his agenda - no one else!
Uh...NO!!!!
Go back home Pocahontas...
@CloudContact @realDonaldTrump For the love of God, please do more than urge.
shut up Elizabeth Warren, shut up!
Why does a temporary freeze on refugees upset you so? When he can properly vet them, the freeze will be lifted. Safety of Americans is #1.
@Jupitarslight @realDonaldTrump United WE stand.
please ask for a full investigation of Trump's contact with Russians-much of work is already done by @funder @Khanoisseur
@RepJoeKennedy @SenMarkey @SenWarren it's time for Impeachment of @realDonaldTrump.
can you guarantee there will be no more terrorist attacks on American soil? As an accomplished liar don't lecture on core values!
all you do is urge and suggest. How about some fight, senator?
He's been unleashed now that he's elected. He must be impeached.
don't urge. Impeach! The @realDonaldTrump! Impeach pence!
clinton wouldnt have ben any diff only diff issues but just as serious1 would have been just as bad as ta udder
airport security is protecting our security as we speak. Thanks Pocahontas.
Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia.
and while he is at it show his #TaxReturns I wonder how much he is personally benefiting from these moves.
Mrs. Warren, you must do more. Invoke the 25th amendment. Remove him.
