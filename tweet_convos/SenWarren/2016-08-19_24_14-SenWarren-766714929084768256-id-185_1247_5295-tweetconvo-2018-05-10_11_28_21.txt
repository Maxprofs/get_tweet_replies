Am I wrong, or does this only affect about 13 prisons nationwide?
it's affects about 75 and most in Florida it's more like hundreds are private
It's my understanding that of the hundreds of private prisons nationwide, only 13 of those are federal
ok ? What does that have to do with the hundreds of state prisons that are private ?
Nothing. That's my point. The federal government isn't funding private prisons. Does nothing for state
first step ! prohibit judges, lawyers to talk to FBI at all !

why did Trump dress up the secret service to land in Baton Rogue? Did trump think he was landing in Bagdad? Wuss
@elizabethforma @SenSanders America for Sale
Ayer ER.Dr.Brian Lisse refused to speak w/fam or exam for head injury by Ayer PO Richard Krasinskas.His wf my RN
Not being able to go outside is a horrible punishment, but rotting in a dirty cell is like a death sentence.
- I actually think private enterprise would (if not overregulated) so a cheaper, better job!  @bigmouthpol
Speaking of injustice, Liz, I'd like to tell you to stop dissing the name "Pocahontas."
I'll say "shush the fruck up" in advance to Sen. Liz Warren. Nothing wrong w/being called Pocahontas.
take a lesson from @RealSheriffJoe and put up tents!! No early release due to overcrowding. He should run DOJ
This has been a real and growing problem for some time. Now if we can get the states to stop....
Well said Elizabeth Warren! Your  speech at the DNC was wonderful. Here in the UK we support you.
Great how many more businesses can you eliminate?
You lead the charge and see what happens.
@SenWarren @TheJusticeDept
Pocahontas
your incredible, great fight! Now we need to put stat of limitations on background checks.
--- I follow you and value what you value.
Does that mean clinton will finally get a cell that she deserves? #JillNotHill

indeed we need to continue to geanup the base don't BOO vote,  they go low we go high
you want to redistribute the wealth let me get half ur pay check if not why y'all take half of mine
I read that and was overjoyed.  Prisoners the right to expect fair treatment.

Many soldiers are coming home with no jobs to come home to. Why can't you hire them to run the prisons fairly?
idiot
what about faith-based Correctional institutions another way for churches to make money and avoid taxes
next step... Let's find a way that you don't have to stay in jail just because you are poor.
You are  a true role model for all citizens, of all countries.  Love your spirit and determination!
My Dad was a warden in 80s. He would flip in his grave at the idea of private prisons.
because the fed gov has all the answers to all our problems.
Tell your corporate colleagues- especially the crook- to stop taking money from private prison. Hypocrite.
I'm happy to hear it but does this include for-profit prisons and juvees as well?
let the reforms continue
end war on drugs and there won't be anyone to put in prison.
ineffective ???
So glad to hear that. Should have happened a long time ago.
The Justice Dept show end its practice of selective law enforcement i.e.PC law enforcement to prop up Democrats.
release Jeffrey Sterling!
Is your pal Soros mad he got hacked? How many ppl know your daughter runs his foundation
getting rid of you would be step two. Back stabber
what an asshole !!!
shame they don't look into private email server tho.
This is great news.
thanks to Bernie, not you.
Hey, Elizabeth, is it true that you're 1/247th Native American and had to make baskets for food?
Private prisons are effective at making their owners rich... but I guess that's about it.
Our justice Dept is broken, starting with Loretta.  Get real you hypocrite.
Ok, I guess that makes sense? I watch "Orange Is The New Black"! Private prisons BAD! 
#UnlockingTheTruth #mtv
#SayDyslexia and help end school to prison pipeline.
it's only about keeping the govt running everything,would love to take over healthcare,govt is too inefficient
The DOJ needs to investigate the #ClintonFoundation before I vote. Don't want to vote for a criminal.
I'll believe it when I see it
DHS is their biggest client.  #EndFamilyDetention
The JOD is corrupt & protecting the Clintons. Lost all respect 4 our justice Dept. V Trump
your buddy Hillary needs to be in prison
One small step for humankind...one giant step for America
How about ineffective and dangerous "Private Servers"!
I agree on step one but would like to see longer term study for steps two and three.
@SenWarren @kirarose14 @TheJusticeDept
That is great news.
GREAT NEWS indeed! should we thank John Oliver?
because everything the government takes over gets fixed.
DEMS 2016!
yes, because the postal service is so much more efficient than FedEx
finally
Pocahontas  FAKE
the shouldn't be left housing immigrants either
for profit prisons are symptom of over incarceration. #FineFromFar #FarFromFine
politicians making a problem and then fixing the problem they created all on our dime, God what a system
@Kram1x @TheJusticeDept You got some rocking titties
seriously? Prisons & jails r a reactionary systems, they r by no means broken. @TheJusticeDept
Good. That was slavery and corruption.
Step 2 is to keep prisoners from interacting and exacerbating their problems. http://www.gosto.org/#PrisonReform 
One way to fix broken justice system is close loophole Hillary used and Indict her! Lock up the Criminal!
Cause nothing says effective & safe like a government run prison. LOL
: Fabulous news! Privatizing prisons is a terrible stain on America. GREED shd never feed on the misery of others
No, the first step would be to un-politicize the @TheJusticeDept
agree #CriminalJusticereform
And now they're moving on the gravest injustices of the bail system, also a for-profit industry
#Exalent #Sen#Warren.
See about directing tax funds to vulnerable Americans.
Disabled, and elderly.
Please get back on Donald.  He might think you've conceded.
now I want you to take your head out of the rear
Once trump gets in, you may want those prisons back for your crownies
.@SenWarren Does this mean there's going to be ZERO privatized prisons now? @TheJusticeDept
Empower govt at expense of private sector.
dangerous to whom?
Anytime the the left can manipulate data 4 Govt 2 confiscate from private sector, they will
every problem you think you can fix the problem the politicians have already created
Once again you are probably lying. 
I mean, it's  what you do.
#indianmyass
Post-pentation era should see great incarceration reduction! #PentationEndJusticeWin
@SenSanders What about Justice System in World where KSA & Israel can violate international laws with impunity?
What about the States. They are still free to use private prisons as a debtors prison
Getting ready to welcome @HillaryClinton into the system?
it's about time
For the first time in my life, I agree with you.
it's about time!
because government runs things so well and efficiently.
I could not believe it was true, but now seeing you share it I know it must be real.
Austin TX continue to plague young black men with injustices.
Why did we ever think monetizing incarceration is good for society? Focus must be on prevention and correction
don't like the competition?
Excellent beginning... However, this appears to be a %? reduction... States and Cities, must also follow lead...
continue the advocacy @CTDems on prison reform.  Thanks Liz.  You have to get back on the campaign @SenWarren
@NolteNC If Hillary is to have a 2,000 square foot cell, they will have to privatize. @realDonaldTrump 2016
yippie!!!
http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/291882-no-record-of-clinton-aides-taking-required-ethics-courses â€¦
so what then?  Fed'l govt run prisons?  That should be a success!!  Because they never waste money!  #raisetaxes
hmm... What about the States?
Step 2 - Not breaking the law in the first place  #Ignorance  @SenWarren @TheJusticeDept
sellout
@SenWarren @TheJusticeDept
Cease the human experimentation for your PHd's.
Didn't Obama put that in place
will end its use of ineffective & dangerous private prisons - 1 step to fix our broken criminal justice system.
Thought the great Crime bill and more prisons was a Clinton program. Nice to see it change.
We should close all the prisons & let everyone out onto the streets again #LiberalDream
Native American my Ass !!
Then the @TheJusticeDept will have to send #CrookedHillary to a public prison for lying to Congress
Warren ur nothing but Hillary's #LapDog-lucky if #Grandma comes around to pet u or throw u #BillsBone-2 #DisgustingPigs #Jill2016
its great have a friend in chinchilla he is a diabetic he has are real hard time getting shots for it
Finally 
Now if we could just get the corrupt justice dep to do their job and investigate the corrupt clinton foundation
Common sense and justice are starting to emerge-Senator Warren is important for this to continue
GOP paid outsourced penny per tweet troll "BethComes" twaddling trash to feed inbreeding family!
now perhaps sentencing for non violent crimes won't require prisons need 2b filled up. Especially by minorities.
perhaps we can reduce the number of "prison developers" getting rich promoting "attendance."
The risk US citizens can avoid if citizens Hillary Clinton for President Vote Not Trump.#ImWithHer
that's pretty funny
That would be great. I seriously doubt it will happen.
Thank you @POTUS
Pocahontas 
now if only @TheJusticeDept would end mandatory minimum sentencing
great news :-) this has to end it's ruing the society as a whole
yes, we jail more than the world's largest nation by population (China)
China doesn't jail their  criminals they kill most of them... not such a bad idea.
so youre against the death penalty too then? I would agree
. I think the death penalty is fine for murder, rape & pedophiles
