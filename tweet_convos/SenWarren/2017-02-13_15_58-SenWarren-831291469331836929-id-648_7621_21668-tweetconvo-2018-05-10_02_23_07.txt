Personnel is policy. Hiring Mnuchin & all these @GoldmanSachs execs shows @realDonaldTrump has no interest in reducing Wall St’s influence.
If Wall Street threatens to blow up the economy again, does anyone seriously expect Steve Mnuchin to tell his buddies to knock it off?
I will be voting NO on Steve Mnuchin’s confirmation for @USTreasury tonight. I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.
love that woman.  She has balls! I will be with her to the end!
believe me.  Happy I don't have ur kids w ur upbringing.  SMH
Really?? My husband served  over 30 years in the USN so you could express ur ideas.  Don't preach !
he needs to be impeached
Because why?  Can any of you speak with substance?  Hey, Hillary lost. Time to move on.
Please don't give him any ideas.
@roamingrn they already have a bank...in Cyprus. Duetsche bank sent laundered Russian Billions...Wilbur Ross owns the place
first time for everything! How kool would that be? 
you're just amazing- simply amazing 
Yes he really cleaned out the swamp, and startrd a septic system.
Trump can't be trusted. Impeach him!!
This is truly "sad"
that's ok I don't care about his money he had that before he became president MAGA!!!
Am surprised his kids haven't opened a gift shop at WH, selling all things Trump!
Fact: ANYONE who voted for Trump got conned and should apologize for their gullibility
So WHAT ARE YOU DOING besides tweeting?
have you not been watching her speeches on the Senate floor? Is she not allowed any personal time?
I absolutely have been watching, & I've let @SenWarren know how much I appreciate her efforts, but we do need more action.
Agreed, but she is doing as much as she can, we need more citizen action before it's too late!
I am def doing my part w/ #TheResistance. Writing my reps, marching, educating, anything I can do. Ideas r welcome
My suggestion would be this: Grow up, sign on, and see what greatness looks like.
You are truly a complicit  fool. If you support this, then any & all harm to ppl is on your head as much as their's.
But NOT naive....
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, you are just another lying hypocrite liberal millionaire
You realize Trump is a lying, hypocritical conservative billionaire, right? Warren at least pretends to have standards.
Bob, isn't "pretending to have standards" another way of saying lying hypocrite.  As for Trump, he's doing what he promised.
@traebordileau @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs @WhiteHouse Excuse me but I'm tired of the tweets aka gossip I want 2 see RESULTS 
Matthew 21:32
For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you [1/3]
did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even [2/3]

They do care -until birth.
And thats the best idea you've had all year Lizzy...MAGA!
Shut up liar and heritage thief.
Those bankers care about money, not the American people Donald.
Your comment implies having xperts in biz is a bad thing-it's not. This is why U lost.
I thought it was because she acts crazy, but that works too.
u are such a hack.
this is Rich coming from the fake Indian who used Wall Street money to finance her run for office.
Do you ever work Warren good grief.Do something. Leave our President alone Soros lover
but was ok when Hillary was talking to them bashing us behind closed doors
U think he hasn't.  Somebody's gotta bail his ass out. . .
@JuddApatow @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse any intelligent person knew Trumplethinskin was a con-man. Now we all have to suffer.
@GennaSchwanke @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs @WhiteHouse Says a woman who lies about her ethnicity

It was so much nicer when they made you keep your mouth shut on the Senate floor!
the saddest, most chaotic, alarming, dysfunctional first 3 weeks of any new POTUS
His Twitter handle should be POTUS@GoldmanSachs.
Other than Bernie and you, Wall Street are friends  to the GOP and DNC.
Is this the type of New York values @tedcruz was on about? Are all New Yorkers like him & hold the same values?
it's his own interest he's protecting
@trialdoggy @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs @WhiteHouse Umm Russian investigation, Flynn..?
 good one.
yes.  The hypocrisy is astounding.
WAH! WAH! WAH!  LOSER!
He's not "Taking on Wall Street," he's taking IN Wall Street.
And with a drive thru window!!!!
Possibly you could open Branch in your $6 million home! Plenty of room!
Lol. Just a mess, when is enough is enough.
YES HE HAS and Finally someone is speaking out!!!!!
abandoned ship the clown car is on fire! the clown car is on fire!
who cares?
how did you get a $15mil net worth on $174k a year?  Cattle Futures?
Because they understand it.
makes me sick to think you could end up being a career senator.
well, it wouldn't be a public branch since none of them are interested in serving ppl.
I love the taste of liberal tears
i believe that is what he trying to do
I love you girl! Keep talking girl keep talking! I'm listening!
Stop walking through life with blinders on and do your job. Bad female for senator.
no administration in history structured to be more OUT OF TOUCH with working class
watch your mouth . Can't u be nice?
from the high interest of Reagan's death costing us nearly Six Trillion to date
Reagans debt , oops .
explained to Americans senator how Republicans are responsible for 17 trillion in debt
and how that 5 trillion was added to Barack Obama debt more would have been informed
had she explained how 2.5 trillion in quantitative easing 2.5 trillion in Recovery Act
we would not be here now
happy Clinton gone into this and made more people aware of the 22 trillion in losses
I'm betting there are still less than five million Americans who understand the crash.
the funds that led to the second wave of loans it's clear he was right.
when you think back to Reginald Falcon the regulator warning bush not to allocate
in his remarks Bill clearly states without regulation a disaster Looms.
realizing Bill had signed Graham Leach Billlie law but HRC only needed to read remarks
I know that you and Bernie had to be more quiet about the 08 crash then you wanted to
when you once turned off comments on a youtube posts of yours as I fought Sachs folks
we just can not wait to you dismantle this pathetic man Senator. I fell in love with u
No one should be surprised.
Your kidding oh my .
but his supporters double down on their hypocrisy.  That's maddening.
If you would arrest them they wouldn't be available.
shut up, you like attention so much and must of us would never vote for u. #ridiculous
So true Liz...So true.
Financial foxes in charge of Hen House!
that's a great idea Senator! I would call it The Uge Bank of Sachs! Whatcha think? #NewPOTUSNewBranch #POTUS

.@SenWarren .@realDonaldTrump .@GoldmanSachs .@WhiteHouse Sen Warren YOU NEED A CAPE!! YOU ROCK !

Wall street is now running the federal treasury!! Now they can do what they want!
Maybe he could hire Am Indians like you. ROFLMAO
; Warren, a political hack, zero skills to contribute anything but high school bullying
and you have created what, other than a phoney heritage. Be part pf the solution.
Maybe a socialist would make more sense, is that your suggestion?
Not enough room at WH for bank branch. All space used for Trump businesses new corp HQ
time apply more pressure Sen. Warren. Dems need to fight this admin tooth n nail
Dems hijacked by Radicals, Freaks, Communists, American Nazi's, & every odd ball freak show group(Hollywood snowflakes) in the US
Shame on you for lying to us, Donald.

Thank you Senator Warren!
Who works for who here?

warren talks a big game about being progressive but she was mighty silent on the endorsement of bernie. No navaho pride
#trumpskkkabinet
must suck for @TheDemocrats to keep losing, but your fit throwing will get u nowhere.
And military: he's building his own #FortKnox. He's got the gold drapes to match.
the fox and the henhouse comes to mind. 
And he's not in the pocket of any of them, but has them working FOR him
So yeah I'd say that he's done a good job not being in Wall St's pocket
@JonathanPieNews @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs @WhiteHouse Zing.  She's got some material.
@JonathanPieNews @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs @WhiteHouse because if you want to take on banks better take no experience i gues
You can't make this stuff up.
@The_Jonathanian @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs @WhiteHouse Poca-hontas, go get a life, don't get a heart attack from obsession
You too talk a big game and that's it ... talk Amer needs action & unity now!
Flynn is gone, now Trump should make his total tax returns public! What is hiding?
Or likely at the 'winter White House'
as @maureendowd has written on her Time's column "this administration has put us on Defcon I". Let's keep the pressure up!
who cares what you think lady ! You far leftists are a bunch of hypocritcal bigots!
illegal immigrants where is the outrage for all the American people
I have never heard anything about the American people vets you only care about
That is pretty much exactly what has happened.
Trump is trying to make the whole world a swamp. And then he'll bill the survivors for water, sewage, & maintenance. $$ #GOP101
lol c'mon Liz, you know he can hardly fill the current cabinet positions...!
The only thing worse than your lame comedy attempts is your public service record.

Amen Senator.
stick it Liz! At least he's not taking bribes from them like your candidate did
Obamacare don't cover that burn bro. 

Good one Ms Warren. 
Go suck eggs make believe Indian princess!
