His administration is nothing but conflict of interest.Why isn't his fan-base not questioning this
because they are too distracted by his orange glow
HaHa they don't know what Goldman Sachs is.
probably think its some kind of cookie LOL
or a fancy dept store!!! 
LOL YES!!!!!!
Don't you see she hasn't made a bill to stop it.
are they not cabinet members that she's referring to?
#Just thinking who would know best than how to eliminate the loopholes the crooks have us for years???
Took my retirement accounts 6 yrs to gain back losses from Bush admin. W Trump it'll be worse.
#I lost mine too, but think maybe we should wait & see before we condemn - Trump got in because of his Business Background period.
A business background that includes multiple bankruptcies (and would have included more if not for Daddy Trump).
Great point! Not to mention all the contractors he's stiffed!
Butt she is as bad, Warren let it happen, all the Corp they give to Wash DC, nobody ever goes to jail.
False equivalency. Trump claims that one of his major positives is his business acumen.
Warren makes no such claim. Warren has repeatedly pushed for campaign finance reform.
read this Trump followers & make me understand why you don't care he's doing opposite his promises
That is like making the inmates into guards.  It's like a child driving a school bus.
It's like a raving maniac in charge.
A raving maniac on a bad mushroom trip.
hey now, leave the magic fungus alone! DJT is obviously on bath salts
Sorry I was wrong it is krokodil , I redact my alternative fact
.@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs Dodd-Frank was worse piece of legislature ever. Benefitted big banks by destroying small banks.
is the kind of person that you would like to close yr eyes and imagine running US. @realDonaldTrump, bless his heart. He's lost.
Unbelievable! He constantly bashed and trashed Hillary about Goldman Sachs
impeach Warren the big mouth imposter hillarys girl
everyone should empty their 401k's, they are just waiting to rape them for profit , like last time
And what did Obama do to stop  Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac? 
Ill wait. 
Yea, NOTHING. #lefttheleft
You ,mean like the Obama choices who borrowed and screwed S.S. and SENIORS ????
@LeeCamp @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs 
Its like Seinfeld sweat pants. Everything dRUMPf does says "fuck it I stopped trying..."
who would be more qualified?
Take your money out of managed funds and do it yourself if you can.
Go on Senator Warren , let's talk about Dodd Frank ?
none of this should surprise anyone paying attention either. His cabinet is like a Goldman alumni assoc, but do his voters care?
It's up to everyone to NOT forget about 2018. Vote out Republicans.
30yrs of Trump's ties to Russian Oil/Gas who wants sanctions lifted, Goldman Sachs, Russian IPOs & Rupert Murdoch on my page
ewarren has failed to disclose a $1.3 million line of credit provided to her by Bank of Ame
I'm convinced Trump travel ban was smokescreen to draw attn away from his economic EOs. Prey on fears while picking our pockets.
@TheMarkMoses @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs why did the big banks get even bigger while community banks folded?
who is protecting us from you and your lobbyists?  @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs
@LeeCamp I would've thought with all the #banksters #Obama put in jail, we wouldn't need #DoddFrank.
I hope the Senate has some say in this. Has everyone forgot the disasters which followed the last two financial de-regulation regimes?
Has everyone forgot he has bankrupted his businesses why not the country
oh is that why he is a billionaire? Put your big girl panties on and #dealwithit
well I guess you could be one if you were born one too. This man has filed bankruptcy and cheated people to get what he has.
prove it.
now that's funny prove what?
How do we protest this nonsense? How do we fight?
Wolf guarding the hen house
communists use words to hide real intentions protect=control, progressive/dem=communist. we get it
and eliz i mean pocahontas  sat back and did nohing not a ppeep while obama was destroying us,
The goldmanSachs people should be gutted
.@SenWarren It irks me that the @GOP fought the bailout, only to pivot & hand them keys to the White House. @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs
We are going to back to where we were B4 President Obama took office
@mialelanixxx @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs your a fraud Warren your dad wasn't chief iwannacollegeloan4free
Americans want a commission to inv. Russian hacking and we want Trump tax returns
Trust no one
I'm sorry I wasn't reading this as I was looking up my Native American heritage.
Lame. Speak to the issue at hand.
The issue is she is a hypocrite to keep calling out others ethics.  Someone with more credibility would have more credibility.
well goodbye money probably won't see you around soon
@pvandck @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs What could possibly go wrong?
What about your Fraud #quicksand #DNCDONE #DEM'SQUICKSAND
GS connection to HRC was ok you. Her exorbitant speaking fees were fine with you. Hypocrite
This is SO BLATANTLY a scheme to make the RICH richer and the poor pay for it
FOX guards henhouse!
Dangerous times.
don't let go of this ridiculous injustice another rich man scheme.
IMPEACHMENT TIME!
Getting money out of politics has to be the #1 goal.  It compromises everything else.  If ur in politics u need to show finances.
and who did your hero Obama hire, Goldman Sachs, you didn't complain then?
Oh Boy!  The POT calling the Kettle black!  You are sooooooooo corrupt yourself, it is sickening!
NO PROBITY in his administration! As a Sr. Citizen whose family came to US in 1631, I NEVER witnesses this.
And did you care when your buddy lesbo Hillary took all the money she could from them and others?
Thank you @SenWarren We must impeach @realDonaldTrump for pandering to his cronies like @GoldmanSachs 
I'm glad ur in our corner, Senator!
@S3nt13ntB31ng @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs Here we go again.Trump's just keeping his promise to his wealthy friends. 08 repeat
Can anyone talk sense into these R's. Gutting all programs etc, won't matter if we have no country left.
why didn't you run for President, Ms. Warren, when a whole bunch of us begged you to?
Keep fighting. We need you.
@feliciaday @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs only proves that USA is far from ready to govern itself.
There is a new class emerging in America- the working homeless.
But this is okay? Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is worth $26.4 million.  How much are YOU worth - $7.48M as of 2014?
Trump is a financial fraud. Looks like hes an expert at scamming bankruptcy courts.
And in 4 years time a Dem pres can clean up the mess and get blamed and fight GOP obstruction.
I thought he was going to drain the swamp, I had no idea he is planning to refill it
, they committed financial fraud... Trump did this for his own financial gain..
So Proud of You Elizabeth! WE THE MAJORITY are with you
how is he able to undo our protections everyday by a immature lookie what I did when he DOES EXO'S
@sentedcruz fail and screw millions out of life savings. Yet he claims to be a christian, joke!
In this we can agree. never under why gop feel rules hurt us. Then some @SenTedCruz would let them
and you did nothing
O help us PLEASE.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What is the plan to stop this?
Call me a cynic, but the rich helping the rich... I'm hardly surprised!
Hillary Clinton catered to Wall Street, go watch a You Tube video. Hippocrit
he's putting in those that know finance. You're the fraud.
How quickly we forget the lessons of 2007-2008. #Meltdown #Toobigtofail
@scslocum @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs crazy!
All the people involved got cushy jobs. Some for Obama others for Harvard but let us be angry now?
how many super deep pockets Hilary had to paid off? President Trump, horizon looks clear
how much is your salary?what are your benefits again? Tell us how gold is your retirement?
we stand with #trump our @POTUS not the hate the left continue to spill into our streets #Warren
You're a total failure so who cares what you say. @CelestialProLLC @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs
Define total failure.Harvard Law Prof and US Senator is hardly a "total failure"!
I don't believe I asked YOU that question.
But nevertheless, I responded.Elizabeth Warren is hardly a failure.
And I don't need to answer to you. I will answer her if and when she responds.
You don't "need"to answer me or anyone but neither does Sen.Warren.I can't imagine she will even see your tweet.
I doubt she will either, which makes me wonder why you feel the need to answer for her?
I don't.I was just curious about your definition of failure.Being both a Harvard Law Prof and Senator aren't my definition.
@tweet4civicact @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs All of this is just "evil"
why aren't you all putting the wheels in motion to impeach him!!!!
Unacceptable!! There is only so much the people will put up with.
Senator Warren - please keep fighting this! Please help us to educate people on the benefits of Dodd-Frank!
@PaulStewartII @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs  yeah , how's that forking for u Trumpers.,..
@feliciaday @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs and Obama appointed citi bank to dept of Eco take your old ass to bed
boy are we in trouble
Aren't there any rules against that? He said it publicly!
. If you care, make a law they go to jail for fraud, not just pay a fine. Wash DC allows it for $$
Isn't there something wrong with a president saying hes doing this so HIS friends can borrow money
is Ms Warren the only dem trying to stop this?
Fox guarding the henhouse  has never been a more appropos metaphor. #trumpregrets
another instance of the fox guarding the hen house.
Sickening.  Absolutely sickening.
DJT quote, "I Fix things, I'm the Fixer, that's what I do"...Electoral Vote, Hacking?
Perhaps the biggest betrayal of a democracy since Alkibiades
.@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs Insider trading
Nae problem Girl , Am Skint 
the beginning of the fleecing of the United States by the new swamp
Kind of like when Hillary erased her emails....so hypocritical....
he only did that bc it has "gold" in the name.  He has a gold toilet too ya know.  #iseeatheme
isn't that great
They also removed restrictions relating to transparency in the oil and gas industry. #ImpeachTrumpNow
But they're his friends!
you mean the ones that protected us from the GFC?
speaking of fraud-how about u claiming to be Native American for over 10 years to qualify for a job...Pocahontas
Disgusting!! They should all be ashamed of themselves. Will be rewarded with Karma (jail) Protest!
Stop this fraud now! @GOP @FBI 
End it &save some http://dignity.You  may look better after.
He has turned the swamp into a gilded pool of entitlement.  #DEPLORABLE
@billyeichner @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs better them than you.
@CLManussier I don't understand how he gets to sign all of these executive orders with no checks and balances?
Many are for show and will require congressional action to effect. Can only change how existing law is being
yes,  but you voted yes on an unqualified housing secretary-he has good ideas #disappointed
thank you @SenBernie for vilifying HRC because she made a speech to these guys. This is ur fault!
this should have predictable results. So funny how the right slammed Hillary for Goldman.
don't worry. They'll protect their own money though.
consumer financial protection bureau!!! Unconstitutional and a waste of taxpayer money ?
should the protests happen in front of Goldman Sachs? Or in front of banks across the US?
back to predatory lending ,foreclosures then more underwater value. My home is still underwater
@moirafae @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs can we please have a hearing on his dealing
Sounds like he is doing what he accused Sec Clinton of doing and would do.
@POTUS who is surprised Trump is not keeping his promises to help the blue collar working people.
He is a corrupt millionaire.
what did Jack Lew and Tim G due to prevent 2008??? Both very irresponsible
of course he did....gotta keep those country club dues paid for his friends..
Trump isn't draining the swamp; he's enlarging it.
Are we supposed to be surprised the Supreme Chancellor Trump is corrupt? #CrookedTrump
And you seem to be doing nothing.
Insider trading is a punishable offense but anyone in congress gets free pass?
That begs the question in over 8 years why no prosecution for crimes they committed? #SOS
& we wait for the investigation into Russian election hacking. Russia sentences 2 men for treason.
@feliciaday @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs that's hilarious. 8 people have 50% of the wealth. Now your worried about Trump picks?
WTF!!!
STOP THIS MAD MAN...CANT HE BE IMPEACHED YET. What the heck is he doing. He isnt do anything good!
remember flimflammernchief screaming about hrcs relationship w wall st? SAD
November 8, 2016 will go down in history as the day AMERICA LOST THE ELECTION.
@billyeichner @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs I wonder if Senator Sanders would have done this? #YouBackedTheWrongHorse
@paulapaultweets I see we have the foxes guarding the chicken coop.
Weird we all knew he would do this, how come you endorsed the candidate that could not beat him?
Don't Trump supporters remember what happened 9 years ago or cold they be that brainwashed.
@billyeichner @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs one of the very companies responsible for the market crash.
one of the many many reasons trump lost the popular vote so badly.  We are awake.
their financial fraud would have tightened it up a little but luv ya
he's too busy protecting us from frauds like you Pocahontas.
I have been saying the that drain the swamp is a #kleptocracy
@FoxNews Does Fox believe GoldmanSachs a good idea? Do they hold Trump to account? Or Cheerleader?
Impeach! He's causing a constitutional crisis with the courts and violating the emoluments clause
Rules for all except faux Native Americans, aka Warrem
@MrsKellyPierce @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs you're right Pocahontas. He should have picked somebody with PhD in Humanities...
Please continue to fight this outrageous action.
regulations destroyed protecting middle class now unprotected and uncertain of our future
What a DISGRACE this administration is.
Pfft, that's nothing. @HillaryClinton gave speeches to them. Speeches! Can you imagine?
The only thing Dodd-Frank protects is the massive government bureaucracy it spawned
@TitanMen @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs Because Trump is a con artist!
of course America's biggest con artist would!!!!!!
is his plan to gut the Treasury clear yet?
I worry about you @SenWarren and your work at the CFPB. You're bravery is highly valued. @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs
And ignore the $9trillion you and Obama charged to my kids & grandkids. That's fraud, hypocrite!
@feliciaday @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs elections have consciences, i cant remember who said that... hhmm..
Is #45 a totally unstoppable wreaking machine? Can anyone save us before he levels all our values?
And we will see another deep recession and losses for the avg person while they line their pockets
So they want to run our country down to the greatest Depression in History
Help...us....
thank God it's going away.
Ever have a moment when you desperately want to believe something isn't true even though you know it is? That's me every day now.
When is the Impeachment starting? Our country is being sold to the highest bidder. @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs
@Leta_says @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs money completely. Draining the swamp is a great idea and I hope you start the movmnt
@Leta_says @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs interest abound in every administration. We need to separate our govt from big Corp/
@Leta_says @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs like Obama putting a lawyer for Monsanto in charge of the Dept of Agr conflicts of
@Leta_says @realDonaldTrump @GoldmanSachs I mean we should show equal outrage that these ppl are allowed anywhere near our govt
