@ProfBanks @SenStabenow @SenatorMenendez "Paperwork is boring and hard, guys! You should let me run a government agency."
LIKE THE TREASURY. Ugh.
I seriously don't understand how ANYONE could reasonably support any of the nominees.
does that mean someone will foreclose on the $100MM?
who cares! You're fired !
Me, to #WhichLiz:
HAPPY #Inauguration
GOLD DIGGER smh
sign of things to come ... think about it
you are such a gift. And a badass.
#FANNIEGATE
keeping us informed so we can do something about it #RESISTANCE
no way should he be confirmed!
Hypocrite.   Detressed home buyer/flipper
there is no excuse abt it tough on them and keep grilling!
as if he does his own taxes!
at least he corrected it unlike you and your lies and how rich r you?
$100 million??? Just an oversight
So glad that you're investigating the junta's finances. Let's begin with #CrookedDonald! Thank you.
You're in TOP 1% you would know. $14.5M, $5M Home. Okayyyy #Pocahontas Thou LIES 100% of the time.
Oh Great, I thought maybe he forgot, as it was in his other pants pocket.
Yes! Try that one on at the IRS!
Couldn't he his lawyer's lawyer's assistant to fill them in?
No paperwork with foreclosures?!?
block these horrible people!
Boo Hoo you looney!
hmmm isn't @SenatorMenendez under investigation?? Ur awesome at cherry picking politicians u call out  @SenStabenow
Glad to see he benefitted from foreclosing on ALL those Americans.  Travesty! Conflict of interest!
I, too, would like to misplace $100M due to laziness.
And I guess u were mistaken when u said u were of Indian heritage?
"BOO HOO!' & SOUR-GRAPES WHINING is all I hear after we got sick of Leftist BS from @POTUS44 /Dems!
what scary is he got passed scared
--Thank you for getting all this on the record but, WOW these people are scary!  I'm saying, try to not show you hostility.
your questions  came out great during the hearings. Proved many were not qualified for the jobs.
We went through reams of paperwork to refi our home. Bank "lost" it to run out clock on deadline
@NervyBastard @SenStabenow @SenatorMenendez 

She meant boo fucking hoo...
(but as next POTUS .,,
Boo fucking hoo is one of my personal faves Just saying.
So what can be done about it? @loricdesign @SenStabenow @SenatorMenendez
Mnuchin complaining about thorough paperwork, being a banking guy, is chilling. #2008
What a winner! Deplorables are you tired of winning yet? @SenStabenow @SenatorMenendez
boo hoo? Very professional of ya. When are u graduating elementary school?
He should try being a teacher in the age of Common Core assessments and data walls!
oh no, what will he do? PAY SOMEONE TO DO IT FOR HIM??!
Ya, all that pesky paperwork I can see it's pretty easy to overlook $100 million.
Steve Mnuchin should have known that doing the paperwork would be easier than fending off Warren!
@CarverBookCoach @SenStabenow @SenatorMenendez what??? OMG
Sen Warren, make him cry!
"boohoo" is the best description of your performance in these hearings.  Get over it@
Obviously this man has never worked in gov't. Paperwork is life.
sounds like he can't be trusted, if he can't file papers truthfully.
you claimed to be Native American because admissions were too tough. Boo hoo.
it was a meaningless detail, and any fair observer knows that; hysterical ankle-biters go wild
Yeah, let him try that line with the IRS after they slap him with penalties.  Oughtta go over well.
It's not like there will be less paper work. And if the paper work is too hard, step off.
Oppose him!  If he can't find time to do the paperwork we don't need him.
U did not disclosed U are a caucasian-faking being Native American \-to get free benefits-liar!
What will he do if confirmed it he is unable to complete paperwork now
@realDonaldTrump 
To quote the great orange one "SAD"
maybe Sec of Treasury is too tough for him too!!!
Munchin simply a liar
Omg, it gets worse every day. Every sane American will need anti depressants!
Bravo Senators!!!!
damn, you just don't get it, the American people want you to work with the republicans for a better America. Be careful!
If the paperwork is too complex, then maybe the job is as well.
I think we are in big trouble with this group of cabinet nominees, especially Price and De Vos!!
Okay Pocahontas, it was tough for you to get accepted into college so you claimed you were Indian.
POCAHONTUS!!!   
Politicians can't appreciate the burden of reporting. Healthcare >50% paperwork

if Hillary had done that, it would have been Breaking News. OUTRAGEOUS!!! CORRUPT!!!
Well hell what do executives do except "paperwork"? Gee whiz he needs to suck it up buttercup!
Hope his GOP healthcare covers paper-cuts!! Makes you wonder about these cupcakes!!
this baby-time excuse from "One Of America's Strongest & Finest?" Impeach Trump Day On Day One.
.@SenWarren @IcelandicMetis @SenStabenow @SenatorMenendez Just think what #Trump 's tax returns would reveal #uspoli
:he did not say paperwork was not done because it was tough. Stick to TRUTH, lady!
more like they will never care if they do find it, I'll be rigging the system in their favor
Why is it that many rich people think life should be even easier for them than it is?
It's good to be king!
#Wtf & #TickTock? CIA?
Um, I think there's a lot of paperwork involved in running the Treasury Dept.
He did not say that? Did he? Please tell me he did not say that.
on Pensions cause those are going to implode@SenStabenow @SenatorMenendez
Well Liz when are you going to talk about how Reverse mortgages are a scam. Also better drill him @SenStabenow @SenatorMenendez
no he didn't?! Did he?! Really!?
Thank you Sen Warren for being so diligent! This guy is nothing, but fraud.
He's not up to the task. This is not a game, @SteveMnuchin You can always go back to your old job.
I bet my FAFSA forms took longer to fill out (the amount didn't even cover my books).
Please don't weary of keeping these folks in check!! They want zero regulation, zero accountability
How lame is that?  Even I could come up with something better than that.
come on, #Mnuchin has a busy social schedule...
Stick it to him.
(excuse my language but) Fuck Me To Tears!!  That is how ridiculous that statement is!!
awwwwe such problems to have! I have $10 bucks in my checking account! DO YOUR JOB!!
are you kidding me?  The paperwork I have to do for my measly salary is tough too.
Thank you for asking the tough questions!
Give me a break! he's filled out forms before. If he can't handle these, he can't handle job!
make the repubs OWN every choice and decision.  Resist and know, we have your back.
By this logic folks can skip filing taxes because the "forms are complicated" what a joke #Crooked
Perhaps as large as Trump's table full? And blank?
Give us your house, Snidely Whiplash.
Can I use that excuse at tax time?
@Fleurette15236 @SenStabenow @SenatorMenendez Poor guy.... I think this actually disqualifies him...and I'm serious...
yeah, he doesn't know how to work thru paperwork-there was none required w/offshore acts #crooked
if this is acceptable rationale...imagine how many MORE  ppl don't have 2 bother w tax paperwork!
Lizzy lied about being a Native American to beat a real one out of a job.
@JACOBSGinger @SenStabenow @SenatorMenendez There's also a lg amount of paperwork involved in running the USA, so #disqualifying
I bet the man has never had to apply for a mortgage or do is own taxes
Has he completed his ethics forms requirements?

Spreading more lies are we senators? Why can't you tell the whole truth.
know what they say in the Russian marines? toughy shitski!
he is smart paperwork isn't tough he is a Los and thought he could get away with something
what if there is paperwork associated with his job ?
if you have $100M I'm pretty sure you can hire someone to do the paperwork.
Heard that testimony & once again you are not telling the whole truth. Did you pay the college yet?
They need to be replaced if they can not do their jobs, wasting tax payers money.
@music4ever77 @SenStabenow @SenatorMenendez Damn...I have cancer, mom of triplets & I, too forgot about my millions. My bad. NOT!
@AnitaFinlay Perhaps book "Chain of Title" by David Dayen should be mandatory reading for @stevenmnuchin1. Learn what he did.
Jeebus! I guess we can be sure of the government record once he's confirmed...
give me a break!
Bound to be more paperwork than that in new job. Since he can't handle it, vote NO
So, Mnuchin wants 2 work 4 .@realDonaldTrump who was overjoyed when families lost their homes.
how In the hell do people get so much power they must hate the 
The whine of apathetic privilege.
still waiting for you to question Nancy Pelosi about millions she made in insider stock trading
How does one forget that much in assets? I can't forget ten dollar bill I have hidden in car
we are caring about munchkins today. The country is tuned into trump all weekend..
Warren lied about her Heritage and H. Clintons state Dept. Lost 6 billion $s. But they get a pass?
I love you, senator
maybe he should just donate to a good charity instead.
Next up: Oversight paperwork reform
you couldn't make this crap up
You better start looking over your shoulder because Curt Schilling is coming. Like Trump, he wins easily.
Does he want the job or not. Good Lord. @SenWarren @SenStabenow @SenatorMenendez
Just what one would expect from a Trump nominee.  Sad.
I wonder how much paperwork it takes to not lose your house.
If you democrats don't change your ways you all will continue to lose elections. GROW UP SNOWFLAKE
I'm so grateful @TheDemocrats have you to tell the truth about what we stand for. Never change!  @SenStabenow @SenatorMenendez
You are a terrible excuse for an elected official. We all have a new POTUS. That includes you. Put the country first please.
Go http://ELizabeth.You  Bernie,Tim,Al.Kick Butt.
and you bitched about Trump's email?
.  Mrs warren would you please try to act like you work for all people instead of just democrats.
Instant bolt of lighting--where the hell are you?!
that is NOT what he said ,no wonder its a mess there, you only hear what you want then if not make it up
He won't be able to handle the paperwork as Sec Treas.
and so it starts. Too much work to report it but not to much work to make it.
thank you for fighting for what is right!
Mnuchin is right paperwork is hard, not like reverse mortgage pw or being screwed out of your home.
Where is the IRS, this guy should be in jail
Your a little weird Pocahontas!! your questions r way out in left field!!
it is one thing to follow rules then, now you would be making the rules,bad precedent already set.
Ask nominees if unemployment rate is wrong then why would ppl with their means need jobs? @maddow @CNNPolitics
All the boohooing is coming from the libs.  Great stuff!
Pocahontas you Sold out native Americans By saying you were one and received college grants!! liar
The arrogance of the super rich & their total lack of humanity is nauseating.God help this country.
#Mnuchin IS A #CROOK #ClownCabinet #ClownAppointees #CrookedTrump #JailforCheaters
he thi ks hes smarter than u guys. Is smug & arrogant. Stop him!
why don't you go buy some new batteries

How much more paperwork would he have as Secretary? Sounds like he's asking to be rejected.
Certainly there will be paperwork in the job he is trying to get
Good thing he doesn't work in an industry that requires lots of paperwork, right? lol
and the paperwork as the Sec. of Treasury will be so much simpler.
Wasn't that Tim Guitner's excuse??
That's the thing.  Those who don't have loads of $ are forced to toe a line!
That's embarrassing and a cheap excuse from Mnuchin.
@Trumpbits @SenStabenow @SenatorMenendez How many of these guys are going to get confirmed. I havent seen a single good appointee
LOL. You are funny. he did disclose them as part of the amendment. questions was international disc
Warren. 2020. Seriously.
poor baby! welcome to the real world.
An ex Goldman Sachs partner who was confused by basic a financial disclosure form. 

Not credible.
"Warren made a name making empty promises for ppl w student debt?" So what happ? Oh right,...
How can he do this job if he is too lazy to fill out the application properly?
Senator Warren how did you become worth Millions as a Senator?
WOW! WHAT A GOOD EXCUSE. GOT ANY MORE OF THOSE UNDER YOUR HAT.
So pathetic!
@MomRovin @SenStabenow @SenatorMenendez that little amt of paperwork is just ridiculous. Even the very rich notice $100 million
I'd b happy to take over that paperwork in exchange 4 the $100M.
#please stop the hateful trump nominees..
he should work on the 900 page document my team just completed.  Pitiful!
Git'em Lizzie!
