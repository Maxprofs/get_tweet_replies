You should talk you lied about being an Indian to get into college and got knows what insider trading you have done
Chuck Schumer orchestrated a run on that bank that caused it to fail, before Mnuchin bought it. You don't want to hear that story
If it's true, I want to hear it. Link me to those facts, please.
Google "Charles Schumer IndyMac." Many articles. Schumer leaked letter he wrote to OTS asking for investigation. It caused a run.
Thanks. I'll check it out.
.   Thanks senator Warren , wish we had more senators like you and Bernie  but
i believe you and Bernie are giving other Democratic senator a backbone
@PMorris153 @GOPSenFinance sigh. ....
thanks for keeping us updated from the inside.
making profit off others misery and misfortune
FAKE NEWS!!!!!!!!
Elizabeth Waren, Go home & crochet a blanket. You are way off point.
@SenSchumer @GOPSenFinance you don't have the votes Senator. You lost 34 States and it will grow with road blocks.
the Dems bet against Donald Trump & did all to stop him. You need to learn he is not to be bet against
@SenSchumer @GOPSenFinance 
Tides of emotions switch with tides of fortune. The greed factor, of not just banks, caused collapse
never never give up Senator.
@8ervagina @GOPSenFinance Return the money @SenWarren

@SenSchumer @GOPSenFinance

and the poor actually believes your for them. You lady are sick in the head
@SenSchumer @GOPSenFinance 
Coming from the lying Pocahontas!
Only if he was directly responsible or if your claims were even true. otherwise stop the hyper partisan crap
bear witness to the truth.
doesn't want to hear those stories because they are complicit.
GOP is a party with no morals.
the confirmation hearings redefine "kangaroo court " our government doesn't even try to hide it's corruption 
no confirmation for con men and thieves. And Trump is still perpetrating the biggest con job in America history.
will lose my home if my social security is cut. They could divert over sea spending towards social security?
of course they didn't but that's why they have to have it shouted at them every day! They work for US, the ppl
Elizabeth you are so spot on. Listened to entire hearing. #hesnotforthelittlepeople #stophimplease
Keep telling the story Senator, we are paying attention!
Please be careful and don't get hurt!
@SenSchumer @GOPSenFinance i know how it feels, just got through a lying cheating superdelegates dnc influencing primary
@heroesweseek @GOPSenFinance He's a crook!
He's a crook AND finance committee is not doing their job.
don't worry Liz, he will still be approved
You tell 'em @SenWarren !!!
my cousin was a forensic accountant hired when Indy Bank failed. These people were crooks!
THANK YOU for being one of the hardest working senators for the people of our time. Love @GOPSenFinance CORPORATE POLITICAL CON
of course not, truth hurts and we haven't heard any truth!
That's iresponsible .
@ZemanLynnZ @GOPSenFinance-Elizabeth u belong on the pinnacle of integrity, I'm sure the GOP hates it when u exposed their picks.
Oppose!
@PrincessBravato @GOPSenFinance Crooked GOP.Their power for hunger exceeds their love of Country, love for its people.
@PrincessBravato @GOPSenFinance time is now to organize  to demand an end to gerrymandering.
@Newyorker2212 @GOPSenFinance Greed is such a terrible thing
@PrincessBravato @GOPSenFinance pigs  all wallow in the same mud rooting for the same garbage. Cont.
They are Cowards
He was part of the problem & made millions off of it. People lost homes, jobs, pride etc...He's not human, theives
Thank you sen warren...more of our elected officials need to take a stand as you and Bernie do.
There is a pathological liars anonymous right near your office Lizzy. Please attend. You are embarrassing Massachusetts. #WorseThanKerry
@SenSchumer @GOPSenFinance You guys just don't get it do you? You lost because you engage in politics of personal destruction
I don't see the word allegedly in your accusation Senator Warren. Have you convicted Mnuchin already without due pr
@SenSchumer @GOPSenFinance you tell them Pocahontas
Your behavior has been LESS than quality.Are YOU above shaking hands w/reps-I think U believe so BUTno
so what? @BarackObama watched like a #ChickenShit while people were lied and cheated out of their homes also...
hello #1 fear mongerer crazy socialist quack Warren. Did u pretend you were an Indian?
The Foreclosure King caused a colossal affordable housing crisis in California.  One bedroom apartment rent=$3000!
so disappointed in  @GOPSenFinance - who do they think these nominees will be working for? American citizens...and we are awake.

You don't like liars? #Fauxcohontas
You pretended to be one of the original people to get a professorship!

@lisaboike @GOPSenFinance you are wonderful @SenWarren so proud when you apoke
what? Didn't take your meds today? Chasing rabbits and squirrels were you?
They praise the NOM for sitting through "grueling testimony"! Get used to it - it could be YOUR JOB!
But we do. You keep it up Elizabeth. We're with you.
Sounds like a slander lawsuit. Warren slanders An American citizen.
@SenSchumer @GOPSenFinance at the end of the day you should oppose the policies they bring forward.
Why hasn't he been indicted? Why isn't he in jail? How can you sit on the Senate and not correct the problems you blame other for?
@SenSchumer @GOPSenFinance ***Warren, you're a loser. I'm surprised the Indians want to associate with you. Pocahontas is crying.
@SenSchumer @GOPSenFinance @McCollumMike @SenTedCruz @SenJohnMcCain @kevincorke maybe he just followed the rules made by congress
Keep up the fight Elizabeth. Evil doesn't do well in the light.
You backed a candidate beholden to Wall St. The same one you profess to hate now, hypocrite.
. Why do we have all these confirmation if trump is above the law ? And does what he wants...
that don't want to hear your voice, me neither
He was also involved in MADOFF'S PONZI SCHEME!
You dont want to hear anybody's story. Talk about lying you lied about being of Native American Heritage.
Most already are quite well aware of it, and so is much of the American public, Senator, so he still can't hide it.
much but not enough.
I don't see how anyone who is even marginally engaged with our current situation could NOT know it, notwithstanding Trumpov True Believers.
the Bush years were a blur of inhumanity. GOP does not gain from putting a face to the terror
when will GOP SEN FINANCE want to hear those stories?
@b1e56df9ce6549f @GOPSenFinance America does.  Thanks 4 the sunlight SenWarren #draintheswamp
of course they didn't. Their hearts are black. 
@SenSchumer @GOPSenFinance and again you make a mountain out of a molehill
@Amplitude350Lee @GOPSenFinance
@Melacook0515 @GOPSenFinance Sen. Warren, please do not vote to confirm him!
The gas and oil party is not much interested in facts.  All they seem to know are lies and misinformation.
@SenSchumer @GOPSenFinance He followed the laws you put in place. That's why you need him. Just like Healthcare you have no idea!
hearings just show how pathetic politicians are,you wonder why we elected Trump to drain the swamp,Term Limits
why would they? #nocriticismofthisadministrationallowed
And rather than protect the people our gov bailed out the banks. Now you're on their side?
Ms Warren how much have u made while in Congress, I'm a 100% disabled veteran I live on chump change who's going to help me?
So that's why you need to tell them. Contact @GOPSenFinance and remind them that we the people are too big to fail.
@SenSchumer @GOPSenFinance don't let them off the hook
We didn't want to hear ur lie about being an Indian either, and look where it got u, Pocahontas. Pass the nominees
Ppl will find out that business running a govt are far worse than politicians!  #TheResistance
Truth = facts and Republicans don't deal in facts (or truth) it's a waste of time to them. 
@lulu_lemew @GOPSenFinance This man frightens me to death.
lie after lie after lie. How many times do I have to read about your lies
@DoloresWells20 @GOPSenFinance NOT ONE GOP ASKED 1 QUESTION ABOUT ONE WEST MORTGAGE FORECLOSURES THEY ARE A US DISGRACE
@SenSchumer @GOPSenFinance Your party  has strangled the little guys out of everything. We need experts, not fear mongers.
his name pronounced M-nu-khin (kh-like J in spanish)
Trumps kind of guy
@SenSchumer - Thanks for fighting for us, please keep it up! @GOPSenFinance - Do better, you owe it to the American people.
You mean when they didn't make their payments? So, you can lose your home if you don't pay for it? Who knew?
and Barney Frank, Cuomo who tamked the housing market helped people? You are one sick person
We don't want to hear from Dem morons today, too historic & Wonderful
...GOP is the ultimate Hear NO EVIL and SEE NO EVIL promoters!!!!
Unfollowing you, Senator Warren. You are a bitter, divisive person and your rhetoric is making me sick.
Elizabeth Warren lied about her heritage to cheat others from opportunities.
They should be ashamed. Any senator with a conscience should listen to the stories and vote no on Mnuchin.
Thank you for your voice, persistence, and service, Senator Warren
I'm not familiar with the details, but I trust you. GOP didn't want you on Oversight. That says it all for me. (y)
Why is it so hard for Trump's picks to answer a simple question? Don't trust a single one.
@danhomick @GOPSenFinance Dont go tommrow.
they do. It care unless it will hurt them!
These "hearings" just get worse and worse! We want to hear EVERYTHING!!!! No cover ups!!!!
And why would they?  They do not care about our country only their own bank accounts. SAD
They don't even want the hearing, period.
@mmpadellan #TheResistance 1) Sounds like the Trump University scam. @GOPSenFinance remember we the MAJORITY are watching
2) midterms are coming so we hope you choose to do the right thing
Had to apply for a loan modification 6 times while bank delayed & refused to comply with the law.
Fight these inappropriate unqualified appointees!
and you bought foreclosure and flipped them for huge profits!!! Correct?
-Top Dem donator George Soros was part of lieing n cheating people out of homes being a partner of OneWest u say
@Judgenap Judge Napolitano says "you have no credibility" on this issue. You are quite a whiner. Clean your house.

You're the expert. " Harvard Law School in the 1990s touted Warren, then a professor in Cambridge, as being "Native American."
Democrats cannot figure out how they lost a rigged election they rig
He also said by buying indie it saved thousands of mortgages that surely would have foreclosed when bank failed.

@SenSchumer @GOPSenFinance love politicians all kinds statements not a link to back them up.Americans smarter than u credit them
Doesn't matter how smart we are if there's nothing we can do about what's gonna happen.
Senator I see you as a racist and a fascist
He's bringing quite a few from Goldman Sachs.  On campaign trail @realDonaldTrump said Ted Cruz was in their grip.
BY THE WAY SHOW SOME CLASS AND SHAKE HANDS!! Ur DESPICABLE
Despite atrocious action, GOP somehow know how to beat drums so loud that people become totally DEAF.
That was called the 90's
I wonder how many ppl who voted Trump lost homes to this man?
That is right cheating the little people.@#Mnuchin .
LMFAO. LIZ TAKE A VALUM ALL POSITIONS WILL BE APPROVED
Of course not!

How many of those homes did you flip?
Define "cheated."
You mean foreclosed when the buyer did not pay for it? (because non-payment is theft or fraud)

@SenWarren @GOPSenFinance
@cinemaven @GOPSenFinance so great to put our heads in the sand and letting the coup happen. Stand up and demand

@sharitari10 @GOPSenFinance trump's cabinet picks – a bunch of fucking winners
-George Soros was his partner....So you will take no money from Soros and denounce his pact during ur elections
He's a scumbag! Like the rest!
This is becoming increasingly more frightening with the cabinet picks! Finished OGE paperwork would help!
So lying's bad suddenly? I thought after eight years of Obama it was all you knew how to do
So it would be like a person who lied about their heritage to get a job at an Ivy league school
These congress members are the real deplorables! Thank God for Elizabeth, Bernie and Chuck!
Priceless to see Mnuchin hands shaking and body twitching! Lying  to follow.
#ImpeachDonaldTrump
@SenSchumer @GOPSenFinance Say NO to Mnuchin he is not public service minded . He will cash the economy again to make money
Sen Carper Mnuchin cheated our soldiers wow after taxpayers bailout the banks. UnAmerican
Pocahontas: keep up the politics of division.  It will cost you libs more defeats in '18.
they are in it for one thing money greed is destroying this planet they are sucking the life out of it.
