and you promised to have the backs of #raredisease patients. You ignored scientific evidence of life saving repurposing drugs
repurposed drugs are not fully vetted.
how so? They are FDA approved for other conditions, already safe for humans. Takes 2.5bil &20 yrs for new drugs.
Are you a biochemist? Can you tell me about genetic regulation and other points of control? I don't think so.
my disease is not genetic. I was poisoned at work. Which is exactly why repurposed drugs is so critical.
That wasn't the point of my statement. Try reading it again.
I have thousands of patients who used the same drug to treat the same disease. No $ in getting FDA approval. What's your point?
good one drug can cross react. That doesn't mean all drugs can cross react.
what did you expect from a orange chump that is a liar 85% of the time?
Oh!! You were talking about Killary's jumpsuit! I get it now.
what crime was Hillary guilty of? orange chump won't make 30 yrs of intense persecution like Hillary!
Question is what crimes hasn't she committed! 
name one?
wait until your boy is out of the WH. Then we can name a few
the sorry POS chump isn't going after Hillary because he knows he was lying, deplor's bought the BS!
You, lady are now eating crow as they say.
Since when did a REPUBLICAN ever tell the TRUTH?
does #FuckfaceVonClownstick even know what Medicare & Medicaid are or is .@SpeakerRyan going to tell him?
His word isn't worth a single Ruble.
Just another Trump lie.
he's going to get rid of all the frauds who never paid a dime into it!  Give him a chance to get in office.
hopefully he isn't like Obama and lie to everyone about health care. Remember no raise in taxes and keep your doctor?
Oh yeah? Well if you really cared about that you wouldn't have hosed Bernie, you hypocrite!
Hard to believe anyone actually believed anything a narcissistic sociopath said.
Hush up Pocahontas. Proven you're same ilk as #DonnaBrazile ONLY worse! Stole $ from Native Americans!
and you promised he'd never be President cuz you're. Nasty woman
crackahontas, as usual you run off the mouth without the facts.Go back to your teepee, oh yeah that was a lie to
@blackjack13 @realDonaldTrump hes a con man anyone that has to say "believe me" that much is a liar plain and simple
if they think Bush was bad, wait. They are in for an earthquake, he will decimate this country when he's done.
keep that promise!!!'
what a liar you are Donthecon
His promises are worthless and he lies!
Ha, I didn't think you were so naive?
us seniors need it to live and survive!
PAUL RYAN COLLECTED SS WHEN HIS DAD DIED AT AGE 14 And saved every cent and went to collage on it
we didn't have a choice it came out of our paychecks!  It's our money!
Will U fight for the poor, including the severely disabled on SSI living on < $9,000.00 a yr. Sen. Warren? #p2
Wow!!! And hasn't served 1 day in office _, much less vetoed or signed a bill sent by congress.
gasp! He lied???? I'm shocked.  -.-
@JumpTheRework @realDonaldTrump and that he he said that matters?  Nope. Not to him
He lied, he is a perpetual liar.  He cannot tell the truth.  Love you, too, Elizabeth Warren.
@Snewlio @realDonaldTrump yes he did but you had a chance to back a candidate for the people w/Bernie but sold out to corporate
Just like he is protecting high paying factory jobs.
Yes but we are dealing with Don the Con..
He lied. Who's surprised?
member when you said you cared about the American people and didn't have the courage to back @SenSanders #NoDAPL
He is a lier !!!!
he lies so it's hard to know the truth or believe what he says.
if it goes away I'm expecting a refund w/ interest for all I've paid in.  Or class action lawsuit.  You pick.
Where are you NOW!?
Yes be he won't be running things at the Senate. Mike Pence will and he's dangerous
@Fairshare2012 @realDonaldTrump Yes he did, but he is a liar... so, there you go! #notmypresident
he probably doesnt recall too busy bully tweeting against #chuckjones
And during @SenSanders campaign for Pres. You  @SenWarren promi.. oh wait, you were nowhere to be found! And with #NoDAPL you,oh never mind
you are horrible   what are you doing! criminals are at large on wallstreet
He lied then/he's lying now.  He lies.
IT IS OUR MONEY FROM OUR EARNINGS!!!!  Hands OFF.
Neither the first nor the last promise to be broken from his campaign. #ONLY4YEARS
he lied, yet again
you expected him to be honest? It will take much more than he can offer for me to trust him.
Trump has repeatedly shown that you can't believe anything he says!
he is not even president yet. Let him get started before you start your divisive rhetoric
ms Warren. Pls return to your reservation!!!!
I wouldn't believe Trump even if his tongue was notarized - He's a lair, where are his tax returns?? #SDASU
is Not a Entitlement. We the People Pay for it. Unlike Congress who get Free Health an Retirement Hypocrites
So he lied. Shame on him and shame on you for believing a proven pathological liar.
he also said he was the only one who could help the middle class & create jobs. Keeping jobs, albeit not all, isn't creating.
Cant tell your lies from your real promises.Depends on the day, on the TIME of day, the audience? #inconsistent
crawl back into your hole
You told us you were an Indian. So what? @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
*Can't believe I'm still being given the benefit of the doubt that I didn't lie about everything I said.
Where is investigations on Election?  #AuditTheVote, #AuditTheElection, Fair Election WI, MI, PA, & FL!!!
Trump lies. Constantly. Pathologically. Why are Dem leaders being so quiet?
WRONG. I'm sure that would be his response.
As if @realDonaldTrump gives a shit about real Americans. He cares about @realDonaldTrump. Period. Sad. Lame.
he's a liar, a scam, a disgrace to America
Trump promises lots of thing. Suckers believe him
he lied. That is all he does. We are lost as a nation. It is hard to imagine our tomorrows.
he has lied about everything else so this sbe no surprise
he's a liar and doesn't even know it cuz he can't remember what he says
I will remind you and everyone else daily you promised not 2 touch Medicare, Mr Trump. It's on tape.
Most everything he said during campaign was a lie. No reason 4 that 2 change. Ds, the majority needs U to stand up & fight, NOW.
. Sen Warren, you know he lies about everything!!! Not shocking, just another day for him.
He lied to get the job.
He has made so many promises and they are based on his latest whim, never intended to keep.
you can't believe anything that comes out of #Trump's mouth.  He is a chronic #Liar.  #NotMyPresidentElect
liar liar he is a con artist
@teka21bat @realDonaldTrump You're kidding!? He lied??? Stunning
I think he lies 100% of the time. 15% he doesn't know the difference
look at who you're trying to reason with!
People with brains all know Trump is a big fat liar. He can't be trusted other than to serve himself.deplorable
What does one expect. He's a pathological liar. He doesn't even remember his lies. A sure sigh of a PL.
#AlsoheisduetoReleasehisTaxesiftheIRSAuditisEverFinish
@lburbo @realDonaldTrump 
He lied
Repeal of ACA
Nothing will replace
Disabled and those with pre existing conditions are screwed.
Agree!
Want to keep policy, pay in advance by 6 months.
and why believe anything that was said?
hope Mr Trump does protect it. Hope he raises social security benefits since Medicare is going up a month to $121.00 from $104.00
Poco you haven't done anything and nag daily about the one man who will make America Great Again. Go away nag
are you going to keep that promise Mr pres-elect?
Or was it just another lie?
Trump is puppet. Look who shadows in bkground 2 c puppeteers. He will not b impeached by GOP Congress
@carmenvellon @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Once Elite GOP get him to elect all their RW friends, they will turn on him 4 Pence.
A liars words r not dependable. Unfit 2 lead, devoid of character & lacks judgement
but all he does is lie.
@___lorraine__ @realDonaldTrump He lied what else is new
@wonderfullone @realDonaldTrump Liar, liar, pants on fire
is anyone really surprised he's a big fat liar?
Trump will feed us a turd and swear it's a Baby Ruth.
hate feeling this way as we will all suffer but part of me glad his supporters will feel pain of his clear lies
why don't republicans want every citizen to have medical coverage?
Promised a lot of things that are not being done
Bright side: ppl will hate it and vote him out if he doesn't
@llendonmar46 @realDonaldTrump ahh he didn't mean a damn thing then and still doesn't Americans new moral compass 
news flash fauxcahontis, Trump isn't president yet. Obama certainly didn't fulfil his promises.
he promised LOTS of things he has no intentions of actually delivering
He'll protect SS/Medicare as long as Ryan/McConnell allow him to. They'll let him know what he thinks when ready
85% lies is giving him way to much credit. The lie is his default go-to when he speaks.
There are a lot of users in the system. Need to tighten the eligibility rules. No more doctor notes or back prob
he lied again and again and again it's time for him to go
That pretty much means he isn't going to do it.
#goElizabeth!
OH POCAHANTAS (ISN'T THAT HIS TERM OF ENDEARMENT FOR YOU?) JOHN SMITH OWNS WHATEVER LAND HE LANDS ON
why do you even bother wasting the finger taps and data?
just another drumpf lie #Resist
@Rachelanthecity @realDonaldTrump the promises of a professional liar aren't worth the spittle that erupts from the liar's mouth.
Save Medicare, Social Security and the ACA...stop privatization efforts!
So what's your point?
@zannerina @realDonaldTrump - don't you know HE LIED!!!  He Always Lies. The man can't be truthful if his life depended on it.
we must remember .. now we are being told we should have not taken his words literally..he really didn't mean it
He lied, trump will sign whatever paul ryan tells him to.He doesn't care enough to even study for his new job
he lied.
uh well liars,lie senator
He lied.
Senator he's built a life on lying and cheating people out of their earnings. A man who idolizes R Cohen is nuts
don't believe any of his promises.
he talks the talk, now let's see if he'll walk the walk.
.@SenWarren However, @realDonaldTrump has done nothing but lie since his campaign began, and no reason to assume that will change.
Racist bigot!
he lies! Lying Don. Lock him up. Believe me. Believe me.
He says what he wants. Does what he wants. The PEOTUS who is king. I'm disgusted.
And we all know how much his words mean. #AuditTheVote
Sorry senator heard the one about love , war and politics...
We should never believe what comes out of his mouth, believe his actions not what he says
Trump us not good for America
obama said I'd save $2500 annually with the ACA. I figure with premium/ded increases, u owe me $25000. Cash pls
can he be president first?
And you, @SenWarren, promised you would work with Bernie to break up the big banks.
because god knows the Obama administration LOOTED it for refugees
.@tialoca13 @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump because god knows the Obama administration LOOTED it for humans #HumanCrisis
not supposed to be looted AT ALL.
And the test's show That is Was a LIE!!
please be vigilant in protecting our rights to a free press and internet cause he'll be coming after those too
trump will give better quality more affordable and flexible health coverage around the board from rich to poor!
Oh shit he isn't going to protect anything if it doesn't concern his family business
And he will
He is NOT my President and never will be.
And he will not with UNAFFORDABLE OBAMACARE. WHY DONT YOU HAVE OBAMACARE IF IT IS SO GREAT? I KNOW IT SUCKS
How many People expected @realDonaldTrump to keep his word? He LIED HIS WAY to where he is at with no intention
of keeping any promise he made! @SenWarren he bamboozled everyone! The #ElectoralCollege should not pick him on
19th because of his lies & unwillingness to turn over PROOF of his investments. His ties all over put USA @ risk
We need a President who won't cause an international incident before becoming President like he did w/ Taiwan!
#ElectoralCollege should STOP Donald Trump by disqualifying him 4 allowing his daughter 2 sit in on private meet
Ingalls when she wasn't cleared to be there! Already trying to get jobs & making deals on his name without being
President! No transparency on those deals yet! No heads of State 2 look over them! This isn't how WH runs! Bad @
best! @SenWarren is there anything you can do to call Trump out on these deals when he is #NotMyPresident yet?
Trump sits on a throne of lies.
when he said "protect " it was a euphemism  (or a Yugephemism) for privatize.
He lied. Everything he said was a lie. Everything he continues to say is a lie. He's a liar. #notmypresident
and?
can lie his ass off, supporters don't care, so long as what he says fits their narrative, he's a mythical beast
-you forgot, DRUMPF LIES, LIES MORE & then looks you in the eye & LIES again
What the F., this guy is SICK, SICK
He sure said it, so maybe protecting to him means privatizing because he's such the  Capitalist. Post Ofc next!
Trump followers will beleive anything he says they seem to think only those who didn't vote for him will suffer.
- I'm pretty sure you're on Trump's "pay no mind list"
he promised a lot of things he won't deliver on... remember we're going to win so much we'll be tired of winning
@sbaran68 @realDonaldTrump they are both briken beyond repair by our government
he lied, like he lis about everything else
a proffesional liar commenting on someone that's not even a president yet,, the sheeples nodding idiotic heads
And the suckers believe his bull shit!!!  How pathetic...
Oh didn't you know ? He lied. Againn  @realDonaldTrump
surprise surprise , Cheeto was lying.
He promised a lot of things he has no intention of backing up. He is only in it for himself.
@ImpactDemocracy @realDonaldTrump First rule Trump lies & he lies all the time!! Get it in writing because video doesn't work!
@JoyAnnReid @donlemon @hardball @politico @Lawrence  Can't TEACH/ CHANGE  and "OLD DOG/TRUMP" new tricks!! FACT!
Lizzy yourColleagues andYou are unimportant and have become Obscure and IrrelevantYou all are done in by Hillary
he lied.  He lies about everything. #bitchbabyinchief
but u made speeches saying  he will cut.  He is just following ur words
a promise by djt is but one more on his list of lies
@ImpactDemocracy @realDonaldTrump Don the Con is a big liar!!
He lied, but what else did we expect? A complete narcissist, sad really doesn't care! Does he?
you're part of the reason He is prez! Had you have endorsed @BernieSanders, He might have won the primary And stomped Trump out!
the promises of a businessman are only as good as the law requires, the sale demands or in this case, the skeptic believes.
quiet goofus
Go away squaw lady. You have no credibility. All you can do is whine about Republicans.
Elizabeth darling....many things were promised! Never expected any to come true!
We are distracted from the real issues with this daily trump soap opera. Focus on #climatechange #hatecrime #cabinetpicks #resist
all he does is lie lie lie. And his supporters don't care.
"you promised"
Lying liars only know how to lie.
he's a flat out liar
Trump's promises are worth about the same as his cotton candy toupee. Not much.
the Liar in Chief/Don the Con
A lie. Trump not savvy enough to commit, once impeachment? SS, Medicare, educ, labor, housing all gone.
Talk to him Liz!~@SenWarren @Backstorymom1 @realDonaldTrump
No one believed him - his word is worthless
You know he's a pathological liar. Just ask Ted Cruz
Trump isn't really a Republican. He's just playing one for this Reality Show of a Presidency.

Warren cannot do math!
why does anyone try to hold a liar to his word. U know we're all f'd.
he wants to be popular...bet he does
Don't you remember that Lewandowski said that people were wrong for taking Trump literally? #notmypresident
he's not even in office yet and you're attacking him you're so biased@KELLYANNEPOLLS
Bit he loed!
pathological liars only think about what sounds good at the time. He wanted to win, nothing more.
Sen Warren, many of us are counting on you to protect us from PE Trump's worst. Tell us how we can help you.
you have no moral authority even to call out trump
