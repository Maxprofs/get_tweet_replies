Why don't you go flip some more houses for profit and then be a hypocrite about it?
Why do we pay you people?
--  I've been wondering the same thing about GOP Senators who sat on their hands regarding Merrick Garland nomination.
Believe me, me too.

#ReasonsToLoveMeIn4Words as if we cared!
You are writing a comment about it, so apparently you do.
she really can't do a thing about it but it's funny to watch u lefties go hysterical... take a xanax and go home!
We will see. Republicans have done all they can to gum up Obama's 8 years in office. Democrats can do that to Trump.
It's amusing that you say that. It's not gumming up when the majority of the country opposes.  #repealobamacare
Trump lost the popular vote. #FactsMatter
go get em
we need to build a wall and enforcement for our borders. It's been out of control since 1993.

We The People Demand your resignation!!!
No we don't.
Your no vote is not news, you are getting more irrelevant by the day.
Carol who? Oh never mind you're irrelevant! LOL
Not about me. It's about We The People taking back our country
..just curious..who exactly are We the People who are taking back the Country?
"WE THE PEOPLE" MEANS E-V-E-R-Y-O-N-E NOT JUST #DEPLORABLES: a NON #alternativefact that's hard 4 sum 2 accept.
Exactly how, whiner?
Dems are done
Too bad you don't have any power

@thefive another rough day on the job?  not supporting the majority of taxpayers?  #draintheswamp
Your work with financial protection & consumer advocacy is good. Why is it you're not making better decisions now?
so how did that work out for you
a disgusting statist against the constitution and the rule of law a destructive Fabian gradualist Americans should recognize her
You have my support!
Thanks Pocahontas
Thank you!
I agree this ludicrous, impulsive behavior is not presidential
Thank you!  We know the GOP will get him in there anyway but we do not need more support for big oil.  We are with you.

 You are worthless...you lost. AGAIN... Fauxcahontas!!!
We have an incredible country. Why are you so committed to the destruction of our constitutional foundation?
don't forget your bow and arrows
thank you for advocating for us, I still have hope
stop lying to the American people. We have won the election and we will go forward with our agenda. We will not be stopped
you're vote is as useless as that of a Republican voter in NYC. Start cooperating and stop obstructing. Help drain swamp#MAGA2017
Thank you for fighting for us. Tillerson is dangerous, just like trump and Bannon.
Robert Gates Personally Recommended Rex Tillerson. That's good enough for me.
We are counting on you & others to reign in those 4 who voted yes. Unbelievable! Thank u for your example.

WHY? Its a done deal. You lose. Why whine? You are a lot like Hillary...But both: NOT SEEN OR HEARD. STAY HOME
Why not give one speech for all Trump nominees. Save time and fresh air. You will oppose all - we already know your position
it doesn't matter. GOP will push it through anyway. Why do I even vote? It's pointless
give 'em hell Lizzie
do the people a favor and do your job and stop holding up trumps cabinet member. You work for the people not your self..
No one cares why--including your constituents.
Good idea!! Mean while we will confirm him. When are you going to realize you can't stop anything. We the people are in charge!!
IMPEACH! End the American nightmare, please!
ms warren surprise !
What does it matter?? The rules have been changed/suspended!!
Can we vote no on u?
champion of the people! Keep fighting the good fight!we are with you!
It is about time and you should have said no for all nominees just like the rest of the Vichy Democrats.
Thank you Senator Warren - you are a beacon of hope
You are Not respecting the Americans who voted for President Trump!
you opposed God if he were a Republican...no doubt.
You are the voice of reason and key in saving this country. 
#thankyou #why aren't you #POTUS?

Wouldn't expect much more from an America Hater
your hatred is very disturbing check yourself in
Keep playing to your base with propaganda for political gain, ignoring your duty to country This is why Trump elected & dems lost
Is trump in violation of the Constitution re Emoluments, and if so, whats going to be do about it. Can't just sit back and ignore

you will vote no on all because it's Trump
Counting on you to join to fascists obstructing any sort of referendum for free speech, individualism   and personal liberties.
but why did you vote yes for Carson?
we know why! You lost at the ballot box so now you lie, cheat, make up stuff, and make fools of yourselves!
watch you try to remain relevant?
