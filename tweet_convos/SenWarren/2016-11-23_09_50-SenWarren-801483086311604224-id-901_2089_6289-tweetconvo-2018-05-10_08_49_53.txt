Sen.Warren, I'm from MA and I'm wondering why you're wasting your time on this and not taking care of our State?
How can @SenWarren claim to be for the middle class while taking huge money & direction from SOROS & son?? #LockHerUp #pocahontas.
So, you took classes at Trump U (if you say it enough times, ppl will start to believe it)? Lies,that is
You help calm my freak, Dawg! I'll check back in soon. Sweet dreams ...
Ms. Warren, can you please convince the Clinton team to request the recounts in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin? PLEASE.
not sure if you saw but the campaign said it would continue to support Stein's initiative going forward in those states.
so I'm seeing. Well it may come to nothing but I'm glad it's happening.
wait til President Trump calls for recall in Cali and NY ....that will fix her
if he really believes in millions of illegal votes he should have - weeks ago.
@Hale4Hillary @realDonaldTrump 
Too bad we'll never get those answers.
< a bitter liar & hypocrite. Lied about being Native American. Calling others a bigot w/o proof

@realDonaldTrump #PresidentTrump
If @SenWarren is so "concerned" about the middle class why does she take $$ and direction from SOROS & son??? #Pocahontas @FoxNews @OANN
They are very well organized & naming great leaders! Get over it & stop whining.
"Concerns" of Warren is same spill from play descending former Dem party to outskirts of political life.Disaster
it cracks me up every time they mention "conflict of interest" bitch you voted for hillary #NoCred
We the PEOPLE demand to know how much money & directions @SenWarren is receiving from SOROS & son!! @realDonaldTrump

Why don't you provide the grateful masses with your Marxist solutions?
Sore loser, Fauxahontas
the sound of your voice makes my testicles hurt.
Baahahahahaha 8 years ... get used to it ... we dont want to get along.
call on your followers 2 #MuteTrumpNow & look only @ his actions & spoken words/lies.IGNORE his manipulation through @twitter
I wanna know how soros is allowed to walk around free?
Thank you for speaking up Elizabeth, DO NOT STOP and pass this on to your colleagues, please. Thank you.

@coopietickles
Is giving away Taxpayer $ in deals like Carrier & he's not been elected yet. We are paying Carrier to STAY.
seems a bit late for that
It is never too late for a wrong to be made right. If you're sure of the 1st results,a recount should not bother you.
I campaigned for Hillary. Nothing I'd like to see more than her being sworn in on Jan 20
Dream on Mr. Johnson!
no one was talking to you. go guard your bridge
Senator Warren, we, Patriotic Americans are counting on you to keep demanding answers.
WARREN WILL YOU GIVE MR PRES TRUMP A CHANCE TO FIX THINGS YOUR PART OF THE PROBLEM TIME FOR YOU TO GO TOO OMG
YOU R THE PROBLEM WARREN  ..WE R JUST FINE IF WANT  HELP START CLEANING UP THAT CRIMINAL PARTY THAT U CALL  DEMOCRATIC
He is having no disaray but you would like that wouldn't you and loo how you support your fellow American.
Lizzy, stop lying. The Trump transition team is doing quite well. Different points of view is a healthy thing.@realDonaldTrump
Very true! Would you please push this issue?
Haha! Are you serious? Everything you're accusing Trump of are things that hillary did, and you kissed her ass!
can you help challenge the results in the swing states so that we can be assured our election wasn't hacked?
We the PEOPLE have a right to know why @SenWarren is taking money & instructions from SOROS! She is NOT for middle class. @wesleybarrow
Wasn't it a conflict of interest for you to stump for Hillary (aka - Ms. Wall St.)?

chill woman! It's not in disarray. Stop lying!
Pocohontas - you have been WRONG AT EVERY TURN
has audacity to bash @realDonaldTrump, when she protects #Pedophiles https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF8LgvjVEjc …. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TRUMP
The only disarray is within your own party or haven't you been paying attention?
Please investigate!!!! Thank you for standing up for what is right!
And questions that taxpayers will pay for to get answers.
@wikicircus @realDonaldTrump I'm sure you senators will do your job and ask those questions, I hope so anyway 
your silence on #DAPL raises serious question: who you really serve. Shows disarray amongst @TheDemocrats.
#NoDAPL #standingrock
If you read @SenWarren's last tweet and believed it, you're watching fake news. @realDonaldTrump

This is the idiotic woman who thinks that she is native american, xD.
