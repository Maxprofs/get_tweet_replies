Seriously, Senator Warren, are you that ignorant, oblivious, or just an impressive liar? GOP Tax Reform is helping the majority of Americans including middle class families!
Gee, last tweet in June 2017!!!!! Come out of your rat hole and start answering questions.... Represent your people.
Go get em @SenWarren! The health and well being of millions of Americans depends on those willing to stand against #DeathBill
What did you do before the ACA?
Is the dnc approach making the dnc great again by doing this #intolrantleftist #endliberalprivilegehttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=s-F5ecJV2jo …
You have not come up with a single idea to fix ACA, no dem has! You all refused to come to the table, share ideas, then fear monger?
I hear Massachusetts calling you. GO HOME AND SHUT UP

Whatever you do don’t retweet this video I found of Donald Trump Jr saying he’s “been to Russia many times” & saying he “spent a lot of time looking at deals in Moscow in 2005-2006 & 2007.” It could make him absolutely furious & wanna seek “sweet revenge.” pic.twitter.com/VXW2MvGCwE
Sen., after I answered the page disappears & I find you here. Trump wants to fire A.G. Rosenstein, he wants to use the Memo as an excuse to " Clean House " at the DOJ. Trump wants the Memo to be his " Silver Bullet " to stop the investigation, control the FBI.
Sen., Warren, I would like to be in your classroom. I was looking at Tweets, you & Janet Yellen , a PHD in Economics, is stepping down from the Fed Chair. I liked to listen when she was asked about interest rates & so forth. I will MISS her.

@SenWarren thank you for being the fierce defender of your fellow Americans. Thank you & bless you! Keep roaring your Fierceness
“I know who I am because of what my mother and my father told me, what my grandmother and my grandfather told me, what all my aunts and uncles told me, and my brothers,” Warren said. “It’s a part of who I am and no one’s ever going to take that away.” Yes you are a liar.
