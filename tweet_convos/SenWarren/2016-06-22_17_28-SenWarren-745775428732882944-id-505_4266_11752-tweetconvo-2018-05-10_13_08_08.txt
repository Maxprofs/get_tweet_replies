who's making sure your "sit in" is safe? Oh yeah, a man with a gun
Secret Service trained and licensed to carry, #WhatsYourPoint?
exactly. Which can also be said for private citizens being trained and licensed to carry #2a #ColdDeadHands #GOA
Background checks are a form of regulation so what's your problem?
#WhatIsDueProcess #WhatIs2A
Hero vs Zero.
I have no doubt that @TulsiGabbard would condemn your attempt to pit two progressive women against each other.
Yes Warren is so progressive that she endorsed the WS puppet instead of its enemy.
If she doesn't walk lockstep with you she's bought #BotLogic101
can you teach me how to get paid to post about confections
jesus christ i forgot about this
I sincerely never forget that post
woke consumerism
Massachusetts doesn't like you any more. They thought you were a progressive.
Ya of course, everything she's ever done doesn't matter cause she doesn't obey you. #BotLogic101
You sold out. You are now no better than her.
Disagree with you equals sold out? #BotLogic101
Sponsored Tweet? #BoughtByBigDonut :-P
Disagrees with you and you forget everything she's done? #BotLogic101
You keep calling everyone a bot and yet your tweets w/media go back to April of last year and are all Clinton based.
Delete your account! LMAO!
Get rekt, normie.
they didn't hold the floor because it's s distraction
.@SenWarren @DunkinDonuts How obvious are you going to make it that you've become a corporate shill?
this beautiful display just warms my cold New England heart.
not breaking up the conglomerate that is Dunkin donuts? Hypocrite
did Dunkin Donuts give a donation propaganda at its best
Delivers Baby! Pretty sure The Donald "Just Got Served" too;) #ImWithHer #ImWithYou #ImWithThem Vote @TheDemocrats
gr8 watch
Every one of you look like TOTAL IDIOTS!  Pure publicity STUNT to take our eyes OFF YOUR TERRORISTS!
Crazy as a loon!
Best donuts are at #TrumpTowerGrill. Try the Taco Bowl flavored donut. The Mexican love them. And they love me.@DunkinDonuts
If you're not too busy at #HoldTheFloor, how about #UpholdingTheConstitution like you swore to do? #BillOfRights
Taking a stand means not upholding the constitution? #BotLogic101
Downgrading the Bill of Rights does.
"BotLogic"?
you do understand that while no one wants terror suspects to have guns ignoring due process rights isn't the answer.
Is this one of the big corporate companies you hate so much? How much money did you make flipping houses?

@elizabethforma Go away phony.You have caused enough damage. Never stood up for Bernie. Now shaking down the banks
Ya you'd vote for THIS woman until she doesn't walk lockstep. #BotLogic101
January 22nd, 2017: new Trump administration begins dismantling of progressive reform. Senator Warren tweets a corporate slogan.
These dropped donuts not for Congress only rest of us ads don't mention this
Do you really need to tag Dunkin Donuts? This is almost like an advertisement.
protesting gun rights and have armed security #hypocrite
@starstryder @DunkinDonuts so cheesy... I haven't wanted a dislike button this much in a long time 
She buys donuts therefore you must dislike? #BotLogic101
@SenateDems @DunkinDonuts Elizabeth Warren is not a citizen of the Cherokee Nation. Nor could she become one.
oh but her grandfather has high cheek bones!!!!
could any move be more shamelessly self serving politics. what a panderer.  always creating photo ops, not fooled
I can guess how much it costs to get this great advertising for a corporate oligarchy from pseudo-progressive
What is the total cost for tax payers
still a traitor #hypocrite  @MiaFarrow @DunkinDonuts
Doesn't walk lockstep with you so she's a traitor? #BotLogic101
endorsed #hillary #dimwit @MiaFarrow @DunkinDonuts #Sanders #BERNIEorBUST
Shame on you Elizabeth Warren for your spineless ways and killing a dream many of us had since days gone.
Woman doesn't obey so your dream is dead? #BotLogic101
And for your information, I am not sexist and it is offensive to make such a baseless assumption.
This attack on the Bill of Rights brought to by Dunkin Donuts.
Dunkin makes garbage coffee 90% of the time so it's just like your decision making. Perfect match
Warren doesn't walk lockstep with you so DD coffee sucks? #BotLogic101
one has nothing to do with the other I'm just stating facts.
ok well if you're done making no sense I'll see you later. Thanks
YOU #HoldTheFloor; I'LL hold my liberties. So: I won't hand my last line of defense to ppl who built a broken $2billion website.
@SenateDems @DunkinDonuts courtesy of the taxpayers. Get back to work. Where are the grownups? @SenateGOP
Taking a stand she's a child? Snarky on the net you're an adult? #DrumphLogic101
they're sitting on their tax paid fat asses. Snarky it is.
not to mention they're standing against the Bill of Rights. UnAmerican
.@SenWarren .@DunkinDonuts wow you managed to squeeze a non-serious commercial plug into a supposedly serious issue. Audtioning for Hillary?
The woman didn't take time to whip up the donuts herself so she's gone commercial? #BotLogic101
.@DMandicino @SenWarren @DunkinDonuts you seem lite on the thinking, so where does a donut corp plug fit into reducing gun violence victims?
@SenateDems @DunkinDonuts Terrorists and Democrats working together to disarm Americans.
by...stopping the sale of guns to terrorists? That's some bizarre logic, my friend.
You think "An Assault Weapons Ban" would stop the sale of guns to terrorists? That's some bizarre logic, my friend.
ISIL has tanks, rockets, bombs -- they're gonna have guns, too.
sit in destroys civil liberties? #BotLogic101
You basically look like a team of paid trolls sitting on a rather inorganic account.
I'd like to be clever & say delete your account but u should likely just kill yrself for taking this job
No no. Big Brother federal Gov't says donuts are bad for us. Tells us what to eat, drink, how to invest. Commie.
Don't make rules to protect citizens but tell me who I can marry? #DrumphLogic101
That's the problem with Liberals, they don't think people can think for themselves.
when I observe that phenomenon I will.
Don't worry, Gov't will tell you when the phenomenon exists.
But what about the small business you support?
you work in the Senate (I use that phrase loosely) not the House.  #grandstander  #fakeindian
This is cringeworthy. Please stop. You're embarrassing yourself.
so cool
not on Michelle Obama's food list!! Trader!
@AnnWalthour SCALES OF JUSTICEYEAHHHHHH
Give us more ideas on what we can do, here, beyond tweets and posts.
the fund raiser was a bad idea within a good idea.  
See the guy in uniform to her left, He has a gun, know why? Guns are needed for protection.
This is the most New England way to lift spirits ever #congressrunsondunkin #NoBillNoBreak 
you're a #sellout #selloutwarren
Her materialistic instincts would kick in #VeryThoughtfulAndCaring
Protected by a man with a gunAgainst gun rights 4 the rest of us.Pocahontas rides again.
why is this important? Your support of @BernieSanders was necessary.  Not #DUNKINDONUTS!!! #shamonyou
Important to keep your energy up when fighting against stupidity.  Keep Fighting :-)
This is who Wall Street is afraid of? @SenWarren @DunkinDonuts
don't touch our donut investment strategies, says wall street
smh
@AnArtDecoDiva @DunkinDonuts Crappy coffee and even crappier old donuts. Everyone knows go to Kings in Quincy if u really care.
i investigated DD when they proposed opening a store in my hometown in vt. I'm sickened that you advertise for them. for shame.
And to think we believed your BS about banks, etc. Being anti-gun is great, but no one is forgetting your betrayal!
Nothing can reverse our disgust at your hypocrisy for endorsing a flawed human being like Clinton. Shame on you!!
In a land of obesity, sen warren advises us to eat doughnuts.
Dude, this native advertising is getting intense.
Sacagawea sack of donuts... as opposed to Joey Bag of donuts.
@richiemckay
yessss!
@IBexWeBex @DunkinDonuts DUNKIN! 
badass!
yes, we all know the Democrat Party runs on corporations. How much did you get paid to whore out for DD?
@supertina_girl Why did you let the Clintons violate election laws &commit #VoterSuppression in MA?
it's official Warren has sold out to lobbyists, Donut lobbyists egad
Good thing the American people pay for your health care!
product promotion is an insanely good thing for a consumers' rights advocate to do
, brought to you by Carl's Jr. - @SenWarren
Dems Run on Dunkin'! @SenWarren @DunkinDonuts
Wow. Endorsing Dunkin Donuts, your own b-day, and invading the House---when your a senator.  What a trifecta.
#JustlikeSelma
Embarrassing
@SenateDems @DunkinDonuts AND WHO PAID FOR THOSE?!
@SenWarren
@rglacues too gunny
funny is what I meant
oh I see. As suspected, this is nothing more than a photo op. Shame
You are pathetic
I wouldn't want my product celebrating an effort to kill two amendments in the Bill of Rights. @DunkinDonuts fail
#Warren4VP I'd rather have our lawmakers be in the pocket of big donut rather than the stupid NRA
@SenWarren @DunkinDonuts
do your job, you also aren't from Mass. OKC, unless your lying about that too
Thanks and Happy Bday keep up good work,haters prove you are doing good work. #NoBillNoBreak
we want you for our VP !!
@HillaryClinton 
Does he or doesn't he? Only Donald's hairdresser knows for sure!
Can you stop drinking from the #liberal spittoon long enough to enjoy some @DunkinDonuts ?
.@SenWarren .@DunkinDonuts .@Trevornoah .@TheDailyShow more food?! 
@cumberlandfarms she could have saved $1.50/cup if she went to the true Preferred Mass coffee at Cumby's.
would you remove Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's right to own a gun?  He was on a watch list.  #tyranny #DueProcess #nobillnobreak
Fighting to remove due process rights of Americans everywhere.  #tyranny #guncontrol #oath #2A #5A #Democrats #NoBillNoBreak
The struggle is really grandstanding and doughnuts @SenWarren @DunkinDonuts
@SenSchumer @DunkinDonuts is that paid for with my Tax dollars?? Bunch of babies!!
@universe2519 @DunkinDonuts
You're a warrior standing with Dems-sit-in fighting for our Generation whereas @HouseGOP are w @NRA #NoBillNoBreak
I knew we would see you mugging the limelight when it isn't even your own house of Congress involved. #typical #pocahontas
Wrong on so many levels. You'd be going nuts if a Senator made a quip about being sponsored by Smith & Wesson.
You are a shill for #BigDonut @SenWarren. MA has far better options than @DunkinDonuts
was the store all out of Swiss cheese????
Wow pretty insensitive of you to bring the one food most famous for being full of holes to a gun control sit in
are you....are you fucking kidding me?? Shilling for a company owned by Bain Capital and the freakin Carlyle Group?
Thank You Mrs. VP
Thanks for supporting our team!
How much did @DunkinDonuts pay for that tweet?
@sanbarton @DunkinDonuts I think they deserve @dominos too - c'mon @dominos - get delivering!

Progressives all over this country have your back
@SenateDems  Finally the Democrats have found their voice, my voice, the voice of those who are the victims of gun violence.
@SenateDems Finally the Democrats are finding their voice, my voice, the silent voices of all victims of gun violence.
Could you be any more awesome???
WOW how ingenious. Did she think of that all by herself to look good for the cameras. What a coward she is.
Please, Liz, don't taint the Dunks brand! You're not good for business! Dunks is about hard working people

It's worth the trip!

@SpeakerRyan ,@GOP @Thom_Hartmann - No donuts or vacation 4Spkr Ryan/GOP until they sit down & work. Work 4 the constituents
Awesome! 
@HillarysUterus @DunkinDonuts Must be nice to feel secure because of the man there with a gun.  Guess we don't deserve the same.
@SenateDems @DunkinDonuts You are failing to promote American patriotism. It's a Representative problem!!! Not a gun problem.
@TurtleBoySports
Hot Coffee and Donuts just like #Selma
#NoBillNoBreak #WickedProud
@SenateDems @DunkinDonuts You people make over $85 per hour and the 12 that sat today is $1,020 an hour that can go to the poor!
