Heading to the floor to ask: where are the senators who will say no to @SenatorSessions for AG? Watch: http://floor.senate.gov/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=2&event_id=1205 …
Take senior senator @SenFeinstein from California with you.Californians love to see her getting supports from across the aisle.
Meanwhile, bernie's on tv @SenWarren @SenFeinstein
He'll be confirmed regardless, but your actions undermine his position. Thank u
thank you for speaking for us!
it won't work. The GOP hasn't had a moral core for decades. I feel like throwing in the towel now.
don't throw in the towel, Trump is fighting for Morality right now!
You wish. @SenatorSessions
Did your ancestors come over here before 1776? Mine did. This is home for me.
So you're proud your ancestors killed the natives? #originalethniccleansing
THANK YOU
Why don't each senator read the letter you tried to read
McConnell pulled out a rule that fellow Senators-which Sessions still is-are not
If they put that rule on other Senators it will be the end of the Turtle
It's a super specific rule rarely used. The Republicans hold all the power at this point.
the wicked witch from Mass!
Thanks. You are all awesome 
Defeat Sessions. You all are honorable women and men. Unlike the GOP.
Take your pacifiers,  no doz, kleenex, coloring crayons. He he #maga

so proud of ever Senator working in  behalf of all of us
At what point is the Republican Party going to be declared an extremist organization?  I mean, really.
don't know. Maybe when Dems retake a branch of government? Wait. Never mind. We just handed them all to the GOP.
Breaking: Falcons claim the Russians hacked the Super Bowl. Protest march Saturday at 10 am. #NotMySuperBowlChampions
you said that kind of thing to the Tea Party. Right?  RIGHT??
Why would I say that to the Tea Party?
Because BB they were rather unwilling to accept the "scores" of certain "Super Bowls" in 2008 and 2012.
Giants-Patriots? Are you sure?
Don't be dense, you were clearly using a metaphor.
It was a Super Bowl tweet. I get the feeling you're talking about something else.
you're playing games and I don't mean football.  Bye
@RevJJackson @SenateDems @SenatorSessions No new ideas For 2020 just sulking again .....Term Limits 
and just like before republicans will be spineless and pass him anyhow.

Bravo.

Funny how Repubs were silent when it was them doing the "obstruction."
@maddow @SenateDems @SenatorSessions how did this moron-Devos get confirmed?  Our children r more at risk than ever
thank you, Senator Warren for fighting against bigotry, racism, etc.
@maddow @SenateDems @SenatorSessions Amazing the way these elected officials act on both sides! You all need to get real jobs!

Thank you Senator Warren.  Fight this racist nominee.  #resist
@SenJeffSessions THANK YOU!!!
Thank u Dems for doing the rt thing & standing up for the people's will. This will not be forgotten
He is a good man.  Stop screwing with him and grandstanding.  Focus on what is right for usa.
@neeratanden @SenateDems @SenatorSessions Senator Warren, your intent is obstruction bcause Dems lost. Do all a favor and resign
if they voted devos they will vote Sessions. More bigots to run the country
Warren will never get re elected what a shame
we support Elizabeth Warren
This one is important. This man did not earn and does not deserve this. Keep him out.
you are our hero!
thank you!!
Yeah, need another "Great Divider" like Eric Holder.  U R IRRATIONALLY DIVISIVE and USURP.
I WITH the late Ted Kennedy a disgrace to the Justice Dept..@SenWarren applaud you for your Courage
we so appreciate you fighting for all Americans. I'm ashamed of @SenateMajLdr. Trump's picks are the worst of the worst.
and @SenateMajLdr, you sir are a racist, sexist . You offered Obama 0 respect for 8 yrs, and now use power to silence a woman.
they should all read the Correta Scot King letter.
what GOP coalitions can you form to block this? #Sessions block is vital for democracy. Can't have like #DeVos vote.
@alicia_lupercio @SenateDems @SenatorSessions #Filibuster him forever! I am from Alabama. Trust me!
What's the point? *sigh*
doesn't seem like that tactic is working
Gj! Please save our world from Trump, keep up the fight!
Thank you Senator Warren!!
Thank you Senator! I appreciate all your hard work and am proud to call you my Senator!
At this point, I don't feel like a single person should be reelected on either side. None of you !
@maddow @SenateDems @SenatorSessions thank you for continuing the fight.  The American people are disgusted by what is happening.
@maddow @SenateDems @SenatorSessions thank you for you enthusiasm and I hope it works this time. Damn republicans I can say that
@maddow @SenateDems @SenatorSessions keep positioning yourself for a presidential run... you are a fraud.
- just look at Sec of Edu, you gave excellent reasons and didn't change a single GOP vote.
great work!
fantastic but this didn't work before. What are you doing to make sure the midterms are better?
@maddow @SenateDems @SenatorSessions Thank you.
appreciate the stand u & other dems r taking but the resistance is expecting a more militant effort
omg .. Go home Pocahontas .
we so appreciate all your hard work to support Americans
and once again you dumbfucks will lose in the end. #pocacuntus #holdthefloor
@HouseDemocrats @SenateDems lost, and will continue to lose for being such hateful liars.
@maddow @SenateDems @SenatorSessions Go stand STRONGER TOGETHER, I'm with you
Thank you for taking a stand. Repubs will not be moved but they will hear us roar & not be silenced
@maddow @SenateDems @SenatorSessions 
Excellent! We got your Back
