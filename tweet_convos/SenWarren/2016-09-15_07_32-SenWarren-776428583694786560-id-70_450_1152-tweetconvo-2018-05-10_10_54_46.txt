Hypocrite! You'll never be trusted by progressives again.
And yet the U.S. comes after low and middle income expat families like WE"RE assumed criminals. Enough!
change the name of the agency I'm thinking No Justice Agency or we can have the dept sponsored by corporations
- Especially Hillary! I agree with you finally! @bigmouthpol
Larry Summers' new paper argues a tautological defense of banking speculation under the cover of lowering "risk."
justice dept? the same one that's given your criminal buddy a pass.
with this, I stand with you. Sad you endorse HRC. It's seem hypocritical and us citizens know it!
This is Obama Justice Department that is an abysmal failure and Hillary will do the same. Party over country.
-I agree. Just like it didn't criminally prosecute @HillaryClinton. Maybe the execs had a mtg on the tarmac. #MAGA
how many crimes by #Ocwen b4 our gov shuts them down & arrest them! We need ur help now! No1 in gov responds WHY?
have u made mention of the millions members of congress made the next day shorting their bets right @60Minutes
they all should be changed
I'm not being sarcastic, do Republicans genuinely think Americans don't know the banks- big biz hold the cards?!
Myself & 300 million Americans been asking the same thing,also where's my part of these "fines" #StillHoldingBag
Well what about the clinton prosecution that obama derailed because he was complicit in her illegal activity.
The same abysmal failure that allowed #CareerCriminalHillary 2 skate knowing she placed our country in danger
Just like Mrs. Corruption, whom you are endorsing, you big fraud.pic.twitter.com/5SoCTQ9SrE
damn right. Obama loves their $. He took their money, didnt prosecute, then sold ambassador jobs. Dems r assholes
can FCIC be prosecuted for failure to act? Are they above the law?
"Inability" is one thing, "reluctance" is another, "refusal", something else entirely.
No, that's being well connected.
Perhaps DOJ should be prosecuted for malfeasance. Washington Insiders call it "politics as usual".
Which is why we are so glad that you backed fucking @HillaryClinton. She is far worse than @realDonaldTrump
Hey they passed on Hillary. Left it up to Comey which is unheard of.
how about the presidential candidate that the fbi said broke the law and isn't being prosecuted?? Nothing??
stay on them!U r my watchdog of choice.Hill will need Ueven if ur expertise & passion is occasionally problematic
Is this because it's on state level like Walker and John Doe case?
maybe Bill Clinton talked to them on the tarmac?

Corporations don't commit crimes... people do. #NotThatStupid
agree with you there
What? A senator is soooo stupid she is setting quotas for how many should be jailed! We have a system here lady?
@maddow This is why Sen. Warren is the People's Champion.
As is the failure to prosecute your friend Hillary, the system is rigged
It really is. What is DOJ going to do to make it right and make the taxpayers whole?
yes...and as we watch the Wells Fargo mess unfold, it appears management has not learned anything along the way.
It's s Democratic Justice Department!
This action of non prosecution represents what is fundamentally wrong with Rgovernment being manipulated by big money interests
someone in government must do something about it no anyone there?
Looks like street cred rebuild time. Wont work unless you call Her out on TPP and other lies.
. @SenWarren @TheJusticeDept Lock them up!
Lizzy Warren took an axe She gave old Bernie 40Whacks When she saw the job was done She gives Obama some 4 fun
yet you still endorse a Wall St. Stooge like #HillaryClinton
I agree. There has been no justice. They have been busy covering up for Clinton and the establishment.
THAT'S WHY YOUR THERE PUSH THE ISSUE WITH MORE THAN A TWEET YOUR JUST LIKE TRUMP #DOYOURJOB
Or an amazing success, depending on who's counting.
It was an abysmal failure that Hilary wasn't prosecuted by FBI or DOJ. It is a rigged, double standard system.
So Liz why did you wait until now to bring this up? Were u hoping 4 a VP nom? Just found out HRC screws every1 @TheJusticeDept
Lizzy Warren took an axe She gave old Bernie 40Whacks When she saw the job was done She gives Obama some 4 fun

nor has anyone involved with Hillary, true scandal
Probably because #HillaryClinton wasn't involved. She is the only target of interest.
they must be named Clinton to escape justice
Separate set of laws for them
Neither has the criminal you endorsed.
Hush Liz or they'll draw comparisons with me not being charged!!!
.@SenWarren @TheJusticeDept Yes, but also why Holder, Lynch appointed by @POTUS (& in turn Breuer, Caldwell), but he not man enuf 2 admit.
And the banks are as big or bigger than they ever were. The fleecing of America continues..#Epipen
So this was a GOP Justice Department, right?
This is the same justice department that refuses to indict Hillary.... nuff said.
Ms. Warren, do you want to change the disfunctional state of things?
individuals needs to be help responsible not just corporations.
