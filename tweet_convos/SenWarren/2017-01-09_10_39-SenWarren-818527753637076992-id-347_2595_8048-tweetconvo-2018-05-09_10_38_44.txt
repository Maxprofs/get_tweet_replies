his plan is pathetic.
maybe we'll get a tweet if we're lucky.
tell Okeefe not to pay people to cause havoc at the inauguration. If true, he is planning on violent disruptions
None of our business? We shouldn't know about him lining his pockets while screwing the rest of us? @SenWarren

@areyou0 i can't believe it. This fool made it
as much of #obama social policy delivered results it's silly to start over from ground zero! #ACA
What plan?
don't worry, if he cured cancer you'd say he was putting doctors out of business.
don't hold your breath!
you are amazing!
Warren, guess what? Prez DJT isn't even in office yet! DJT has done MORE than Obummer's 8 yrs!
#YouDontKnowTrump?
Thank you Senator Warren for your hard work.  Saying you are going to have a plan & doing nothing is Sad, Sad!  @realDonaldTrump
worry about the country not trump!
@IntrovertRN1975 @realDonaldTrump Really, because I'm still waiting for promised tax returns. 31 mos now!
Just another lie from the King of liars. We need a new term to specifically apply to Trump. working on it.
New term #BLOTUS
Don't you know how much time 'keeping up' with social media takes up? He hasn't slept!
u lost. Keep waiting.
@RickerLA423 @realDonaldTrump He can't plan his next tweet.
I have no doubt Donald will cancel tomorrow's press conference too. He's full of lies and broken promises.
How long has it been since an executive from a large financial institution went to jail?
It's not mandated by law, so stick it in your ear.
The Democrats are going to have to pin Trump to the mat before that happens. I hope there are a few honest GOP
AND OBAMA PROMISED I COULD MY DOCTOR, AND HEALTHPLAN, AND SAVE $2500 INSTEAD AMERICA HAS BEEN SCREWED BY YOU!

#HillaryClinton #Rosie and #MerylStreep have been insulting me all day today. They are pissed  off! Good! 
#Tatiana
Pocahontas, another reason the @TheDemocrats are irrelevant. Keep up the good work
good to admit you're fine with corruption and flouting the rule of law.
Are you talking about the last 8 yrs of Obummer?
Try holding your breath, I understand that helps move things along.
who are you?!
People keep taking Donald Trump literally instead of looking into his heart which is so pure.
Honestly I don't think Trump can or will stay on task, I think he has ADHD.
that's not even a complete sentence..
warren you couldve been a big player with Bernie in the primaries. What happened to you? #twostepsback
& his tax returns, Melania's immigration history, only what HE knows about the hacking, a press conference...
and no doubt will continue waiting.  He thinks promises are merely a collection of meaningless words. #TrumpFail
and is the "audit" over?  May be we need to ask king trumps bff putin to hack it out of him.
I'm going to make it great.
Actually, we see his empire unfolding with the appointment of his cabinet.
He doesn't have to. He's exempt, as is all of Congress. It's in the Code of Federal Regulations... Lie-awatha.
"We'll get to that on Wednesday ". Don't believe it!
LOOSE LIPS SINK SHIPS. You are on your way out....
we are still waiting Trump. Please keep at him Sen Warren
No plans.. Only w will do it. We will do it.. We will Make USSR Great  Again
RELEASE YOUR TAXES!! If I have to pay taxes then release them what r u hiding?!
it's been written. Rhianovskii "A History of the Russian Empire".
please continue to hold  @realDonaldTrump to task.
The master of wait and see.
You are our best hope to corral the power of good to counter DT
several ways-- he is so corrupt and impulsive , clearly he will commit impeachable offenses
There are so many conflicts and already Trump has been making money off the Presidency. Will the R's have enough guts to impeach?
don't hold your breath! deflection, mendacity, prevarication at work
warren, he doesn't own a fucking hotdog stand, u can't do it in 25 days dummy
he already did - try and keep up Liz
We've a complete collapse of government, a coup perpetrated by a foreign power and a demented puppet
and we're still waiting for you to STFU
Why shall waiting for him he refused to released the taxes!! Will he give up the Business??? I don't think so!!!
I am SO damn glad—nay proud!—to have @SenWarren as my senior Senator, raising hell to save my country from @realDonaldTrump. Thank you!
God help us. Im actually afraid of what that man will do to this country. The tweeting is disturbing.
His word doesn't have any Truth or Integrity!
Donald Trump expects to create his own fiefdom....so disappointed...
Still having Senators like Elizabeth Warren, fighting for the people, gives me hope.
We have a year and a half waiting for his tax returns... @realDonaldTrump
no one cares!!

@trump_scamalert @realDonaldTrump we know Putin interfered accept election and move on but bc it was rigged he need 2 do right
@trump_scamalert senator Warren bc Dems r not in control doesn't mean the ppl won popular vote stand on #principles
@trump_scamalert it will never happen and its troubling bc congress is in control and extremism u need the p
#Californians #VOICE
all his ass does is LIE
I suspect that he has a negative net worth. He could be penniless if he has too liquidate his business'.
Let's make sure @realDonaldTrump doesn't weasel out of this promise!! @CNN @FoxNews @MSNBC @NBCNews
What do you think the chances of his promised 1/11 press conference actually happening are?
@darlene913 @realDonaldTrump We're waiting #BLOTUS
That's easy, to increase his wealth and family business by as much as he can. The man has no shame, ethics, or honesty.
there is no plan but to rape working Americans of SS and Medicare. Stop waiting Senator!
We need to give Trump the same treatment republicans gave President Obama trash talk him and no respect,truth.
And how many days since he promised to release his taxes?
no one cares.
@realDonaldTrumpYOU ARE ASKING A LOT OF TRUMP.TO GIVE UP WHAT HE'S WORKED FOR,HE'S NOT GOING TO DO IT,THAT'S TOO MUCH
it's been years since U took $$ from Harvard 4 lying about being Indian.We R still waiting 4 U to give it back
There is no plan. The Emperor has no clothes.
Drump is stringing the MEDIA along like puppets. Drump has no plans for what he is going to do for the america
the plans are in the folder with his taxes. Courier has not arrived. Can't trust computers though.
He's too busy defending himself against negative tweets.
still waiting to see lotsa stuff, like his Tax Returns.
we?   Not me
and STILL waiting on his tax returns...

yes mom! Put his ass on the clock!
We are still waiting 4U Ms. Warren to tell us why DEMS did nothing #TARP #Stimulus #Obamacare #ISIS
we will not forget, nor will we be silenced.
"We will not go quietly" - Don Henley
And my guess is that we'll still be waiting in 2020.
He must have been a student who never got his work done by the due date
I don't believe he has to give you any information if he does he's doing it out of courtesy
@chitownal21 @realDonaldTrump hey lizzy  when he needs to he will do so . Right now nobody gives a fuck what you think
where are his taxes? Criminal fraud
criminal fraud what you reading on tax law.
fraud and a criminal what do you expect
@AlyNotAlly @realDonaldTrump DJT is waiting for inaguaration... afraid any announcement will get him impeached before office.
Poco we are waiting for you to work instead of complaining all day. What have you done for us lately? NOTHING
It's Been 9 Months+ Since T Said He Was Going 2 Show U.S. His Tax Returns!!!
yawn. Give it up.
@knightn2015 @realDonaldTrump Any sign of the tax returns ?
he's already ceded real power to his mafia henchmen @realDonaldTrump
Just be quiet @SenWarren Your Marxist blather is better left unsaid.
what about his tax returns? We are still waiting for those too!
Methinks @realDonaldTrump is planning on January 21st. 2021. With any luck, 2025.
He can't count that far ahead...
thank you for fighting so hard to try to keep @realDonaldTrump accountable for his promises and lies.  You're essential.
He's waiting for instructions from the real president, Putin.
Sen Warren, my husband and I live in MA, voted for you, and con't to support you.  Do not give one inch to the republicans!
@marcylauren @realDonaldTrump I don't know why but I have the feeling there will be no press conference with the horrible media.
I bet Ryan and McConnel Don't care, Sad for our Government to have such self interest at top levels.
@PrincessBravato @realDonaldTrump of course we are, he's getting his band of thieves together first, absolute SHAM!
let the corruption begin!
@MKlave @realDonaldTrump Damn! What's he gotta do to distract you from this issue Senator...Start a nuclear War??????
Trump never followed rules or kept promises during election & still WON! Why should he start now? @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump #cantfixtrump
He's waiting for Putin to tell him the Plans! 
i'm still waiting for @realDonaldTrump presser where he's gonna show the world the "so-called hacking" info "no one else has."
We're still waiting for his tax returns too.
Try near Two Years . But, the cabinet appointments & GOP are clues to the GOP's giddy Coup
Thank you for reminding the Twitter in Chief! !!
TAX RETURNS???
old news. Stop crying.
Also waiting on those tax returns & Melania's immigration papers & presser promises, too. #TheResistance
haha the resistance....no one cares!!
We're waiting for you to announce you're running for President in 2020.  Please do!
I expect that it will become clear when it is too late to oppose. Why didn’t you object to the electoral vote? @realDonaldTrump
and....those taxes??????
He just showed u his plans by hiring his son in law & a judge said it's legal. Will you the dems do anything?
It took good 7 days to make the heavens and the earth, guess God was slow too. Why is your opinion important
25 days is so much better, really the best. People tell me 25 is so great!
my guess is the press conference scheduled for Wednesday will be cancelled as well
And know the son in law is part of govt?  Already setting up his replacement?
The Trump fortune will be first and always first. America will be 2nd fiddle to his greed. He doesn't pay tax.
I doubt that he has any plans, as such.  Maybe he'll just wing-it!
What the hell is wrong with you this is not a president he plans on. Becoming king ! Wake up !!!
Do you people not see a Trump has broken laws ,careless about ethics ,plans to give control of our nuclear and financial systems to friends
.@SenWarren @auntybabs08 @realDonaldTrump what the hell is #Pelosi talking about concerning #obamacare's failure #Hillary #Trump #love #cute
yeah he has no plan he wants you to let that go follow the money 
He needs 25 more days, just be patient
thank you for this! https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2017/01/09/elizabeth-warren-takes-aim-donald-trump-pick-for-education-secretary-betsy-devos/bsPfL1JE2Zun4P2ItobDcO/story.html … #betsydevos stay away from our schools!
And what about his Bank Statements....
You guys have a plan, right? You can't let this severely unbalanced man have access to our defense secrets! Save the world!
.@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Just think, soon it will be 1460 more days
and not one second more
Maybe less. Maybe he'll slip on a banana.
well he's certainly acting like he wants to be impeached by the 12:01 pm on Inauguration Day
get real show us the money and other ties that bind- incl son in law
@thegarance @realDonaldTrump Don't hold your breath. Lying is in his DNA.
were are his tax returns, a fence as a wall, family members as cabinet members?
it has been years since government has borrowed money from Social Security.. when will it be paid back
-still waiting for his "inside info" on why Russia is innocent of hacking.WHY IS NO ONE CALLING HIM ON HIS SHIT!
Sen warren, this employee DT, has committe http://Treason.Tax  evasion America has the right to know truth
If DT would stop time spent in childish tweets,he'd have time to roll out plan( if there is one)
I'm still waiting to see his taxes he promised he's had plenty of time to have them fixed
don't proceed until everything is complete President Obama can stay on
Also waiting on tax returns that will never be produced
good grief just the notion of you makes me want to puke!!
@NealKRed @realDonaldTrump but it takes so long for them all to memorize the same lies! Besides...he has to tweet...24/7.
and he had to squeeze in time for Kanye PR, gloating tours and SNL watching
#liberalprivilege
SENATOR WARREN PLEASE HELP US THE DEMOCRATS AREN'T DOING ANYTHING PLEASE HELP
Is this the (in)famous Press Conference we've all been waiting for?
are his ties to O.C. impeachable?
#realpressconference He's a Russian Spy!
@tx_blue_dot @realDonaldTrump And while your at it Donny, where are your taxes?
look, trump owes dozens of banks a billion dollars. He plans for us to help free him of this debt. Be real.
Please keep up the good fight, Mrs Warren! Thank you!
meanwhile he's picking his fight very wisely...like with the amazing #MerylStreep! please grow up, man kid!
also still waiting for taxes not tweets
#PhoneBankAlert Our future is at stake. Fight back! CALL. Please pass it on. Share.
We're still waiting for the proof of your Native American hood .......
he doesn't have a plan so we will just keep waiting.Same as we r waiting for his tax returns!
and now his son in law as an adviser     good god have they no shame
Be patient pocahontas! Hes not on YOUR timeline. GO SMOKE A PEACE PIPE OR SOMETHING
never was a plan
Please be patient, Liz.  It takes a long time to unwind the total mess you created with #obamacare. This can wait. #lowpriority

and for his tax returns
-keep on waiting the truth want set him free.
@frannie1225 @realDonaldTrump He's tweeting it soon! Or something....
Read between the lines: He's going to enrich his family and friends. Sadly, he seems to be the most uneducated of the bunch.
It's not empire. He makes money letting others slap his stupid name on buildings. @realDonaldTrump
country is more important than Trump's personal empire,liberals always worry about rich more than middle-class
pretty sure it's about how corrupt your boy is @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
sadly he's to busy tweeting about insignificant BS
Elitist, gunhating-well guarded, carbonhating-high carbon usage plane, Wallhating-high wall houses,ouoftouch
Still waiting to find out why you pretended to be a Native to benefit and most likely from taxpayer funds.
#nothappening #keepwaiting #suchanidoit #notmy President!
And while we're at it, where are those tax returns @realDonaldTrump said he'd release AFTER THE ELECTION??
Still repeating his stupid lies? @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
& we will continue to wait. He has no intention of following thru
He's hoping to distract us by  endlessly tweeting about his detractors.
Did we ever hear his amazing hacking revelations promised Tuesday or Wednesday? He's all promises,no follow-up.
In case U haven't noticed he's building it right now w/ the remnants of our Democracy #NotFooled #ImTheAvalanche
it's possible he has #NothingSandwich #Ω
