When is @HillaryClinton going to release the transcripts of her million-dollar Wall Street speeches?
You mean protecting IRA's, and 401 K's.
yeah!!!
@SenWarren @HouseDemocrats @GOP
It's not just the GOP. Wall Street money is an equal-opportunity corrupter.
If money corrupts Rs, it might corrupt Ds too. http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?ind=F07 …
Yes yes yes
Help wallstreet? Are you that stupid?

How about @HillaryClinton's efforts to help Wall Street at the expense of working families? What about that?
What precise policy does @HillaryClinton embrace or promote that does this? Honest question.
Start here, and research from there https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12mJ-U76nfg …
This tells me that in the WH, she acts even better than as a Senator. Not worse.
I can't even comprehend that.
Perhaps I'm wrong. But as far as her current platform goes, I think she's got it right.
Wow.. how rich. Especially,  after you are supporting #Queen of #WallStreetMoney #Hillary. #YourASellOut!
LYING CROOKED Corrupt Warren WALL street partners with CROOKED HILLARY America KNOWS November TRUMP wins
OMG SHUT UP YOU ENDORSED THE 1%'s BEST FRIEND. Liar.
Ummmm you endorse Hillary Clinton who's corrupted by Wallstreet. #nodifference #corruption
Love you. Look into Trump paying his family the "lion share" of campaign payroll from RNC.funds
Hey maybe your old grannie friend Hillary can help you make some Wall Street Money!
umm, your nominee is the epitome of a Wall Street first politician. Just look at where her money came from
man you are embarrassing yourself
And that includes the Wall Street candidate they've apparently selected as their presidential nominee, too!
You speak with forked tongue squaw.
One can reasonably czg aspersions on your sanity!!! @SenWarren @HouseDemocrats @GOP
Umm... by electing Hillary Clinton? Still waiting for an explanation of you endorsing her..  #tytlive
Hillary & her worked together when she was 1st Lady & she knows what she'll be able to do as pres
Yeah, they worked together and then when HRC became Senator she switched positions. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12mJ-U76nfg …
@YouTube It's a different rodeo but EW knows Hillary as pres is a force to be reckon with. & Hillary did more than BS
Seems pretty clear right there she switched positions in favor of Wall St at expense of middle class.
Sorry I forgot I'm dealing with a BS supporter. Have a nice day.
Ok, sorry if my consistency offended you.
And if you took the time to LISTEN to what was on your link U would know that EW herself said she understood.
Lady! You are Wall Street!
How would you know about working families? All you do is take a free ride because you pretend to be NA
do you honestly think clinton will be any different #BernieOrBust #inditeHRC #FBImWithHer
hasnt @HillaryClinton taken more "wall st" money than every other candidate combined?
@SenWarren
I hope you can shake these cowards Democrats.
@Animals4Bernie @HouseDemocrats @GOP u gonna tell that 2 #HillaryClinton madam? #ReleaseTheTranscripts #ClintonCash #BernieOrBust
I'm sure we could read all about it in Hillary's Wall Street speeches; the ones she hides from the voters!
New theory:  We are a #PseudoDemocraticOpenMarketPlutocracy  Thoughts?

All Hillary has done is help Wall Street.

.@SenWarren @HouseDemocrats @GOP Talking more forwarding than working if schmoozing correctly, Hillary's main method
U demonrats pushed fed reserve which is privately owned check your history!
Should've supported bernie instead ot your career.
How?
but  not against Democrats that do the same thing, a convoluted philosophy of opportunism!
did you read @politico article about @HillaryClinton true base = #WallStreet. Let's face reality.
too bad you lost all the #millennials to #BERNIE 
GOP? GOP???  What about HRC???
Stop Killary's love affair with Wall St. 
Stop lying. Stop speaking with forked tongue.
you very good women sen
disappointed
they need to stand up against Hillary too. She's owned by Wall Street.
but when wallstreet supports hillary, thats all well n good, please quit now  and leave politics
Ha!  You endorsed Wall St. darling, HRC.  Have you no shame or sense of irony?
I think you need to tell Hillary that who keeps getting money from Wall Street
if your against wall st, then why did you vote against audit the Fed#hypocrite
You're a disgrace to progressives everywhere for supporting @HillaryClinton ,a flip flopping, lying, center-right corporate shill
you and @HouseDemocrats are a disgrace on this country.  You prefer a totalitarian regime based on fear.  Not today #Pocahontas.
Meanwhile back at the ranch Pocohontas continues to live in her multi million dollar home, right Liz?
You know, this Democrat had his vote stolen in the CA primary. When is the #DNC going to stand strong against #ElectionFraud ?
@SenWarren @HouseDemocrats @GOP
vote republicans out the November!  Can't take this anymore!
you're word mean nothing now. Useless shill.
how about the candidate you endorsed who takes money from wall Street for her speeches? Or voted for the wall Street bailout?
Awww....GFU
please explain how anything is at the expense of families.
Just how much $$ did Hillary make off of WALL STREET?  Hmmm.. She won't release that!  #LyinLiz  #Democrats
Come on Pocahontas you're making shit up!!
Just stop. You've lost all credibility. Real progressives are tired of you.
you were supposed to be one of us
you're all wolves in sheep disguise guiding sheeple.  you have some balls to be talking to us
have long gone stopped being the party of the people. You're slowly becoming something worst than the GOP
you are the problem, you will never be the solution.  Go away.
Elizabeth, please go back into your hole in the ground.
Substitute Hillary for GOP so your tweet will make sense.
That's "rich" coming from a 1%er @SenWarren!

#SheSoFake #ElizabethWarren

#hypocrisy #fraud
can you explain to me how you can support Hillary Clinton who has received donations from wall street?
aaaÀl
tell that to your bitch Corrupt Hillary. She's the one they're giving all their money to.
How about you stand up to the bankers stealing the election? #TheStruggleContinues
stand strong is democrat for gridlock
why are you pretending to be against wall street when you endorsed them? @HouseDemocrats we arent buying it liz.
so that means you are not supporting Hillary?
This coming from Elizabeth Warren who sold out Bernie to back Hillary Clinton
you can't b serious. Wall Street has bought and paid for Hillary  . She will defend them.
You are a hypocrite.
We need Hillary to commit to re-enactment of Glass-Steagall. She separates from Wall Street. Gains trust.
I'm a Democrat, but Hillary is going to do that too. Bernie stands alone.
Then why did you endorse a Candidate who has taken so much money from Wall St.? I really want to know!
What is with your connection to hedge fund manager Michael Masters?
Lol, start with your buddy #CorruptHillary. Biggest supporter of #WallStreet
but democrats  are Wall St. And you are delusional
should have backed Bernie!!
Ironic considering you sold your soul to the face of Wall Street.
@KKK Time to end your party suppression of minorities. Warren do America a favor and step down.
Donald Trump is Clinton foundation donor #OurRevolution #StillSanders
then why endorse Hillary? Wall Street owns her.
you don't get to say stuff like that anymore #sellout #BernieOrBust
THEN WHY DID YOU ENDORSE HRC?  #fraud #sellout
Sen. Warren, you make no sense.  We KNOW who HRC is, and so do you, and yet you endorse her?
It is never too late to do well.
Then why would you endorse Wall Streets own in @HillaryClinton if you are for working families?
the big problem is the unemployed caused by WallStreet - those in work still have something
I can't really trust you anymore. So, no. I no longer support you or your democrats. #BernieOrBust!
Than why are you supporting a wall street puppet for president? #StillSanders #shamewarren
endorse @HillaryClinton & her offerings u sold the American people out #neverhillary
R U kidding? U partner with the #WallStreet queen, #HRC, and now want to fake "Standing strong??"

Go. Away.
- you mean Hillary's friends, right?
if you side with Hillary you're as fake as Obama was. You probably are fake though.
Why don't you have Hillary tell them to cut it out?  #nocredibility
Don't  most working people's 401k's and companies shares plans depend on how strong the stock market is.
Look inside H pocketbook, lots of wall street money.
Your tweet rings hollow now. Trust is damaged
: Elizabeth, I Appreciate the fight you put up 4 we the people.
Come on Pocahontas you got this!  Read @BenjySarlin United States of Trump.  Or else I'm stuck in SouthPark
Blah blah blah
So hard for the elderly. Food or medication? Not everyone has family assistance.
But not so much against DNC efforts to do the same.
Says the senator who lost all respect by endorsing the pro-corporate, pro-bank HRC b/c she's a "fighter."
Don't be having a Pow Wow to be Hillarys VP if you dont like Wall Street. Crooked Hillary takes their Money!
keep doing what you doing. Ignore the haters.
don't listen to the haters.  Keep doing what you doing.
how about instead of standing against lets work with @GOP to get things done. And that goes other way too #tcot
Found a link.  Better information than the silly baiting going back and forth: http://docs.house.gov/floor/ 
.@SenWarren doesn't the news that Wall Street won't let HRC pick you for VP show you that they own her? #NeverHillary #IndictHillary #Bernie
THEN WHY HAVE YOU ENDORSED & SUPPORT THE WALL ST SHILLARY #hypocrite
Hillary endorsement gives you zero credibility
Oh Liz, you don't really think we're buying this, do you?
you can't be serious, look what the Democrats of going to minorities.
How will Wall Street afford @HillaryClinton's speaking fees if you slash them?
So Says...'Lie-Awatha' ....the house flipper!!!
Totally
Somebody needs to tell Warren she's lost her credibility.
Just don't send the same person who told Sanders he lost the election, he didn't get the message!
Neither did honest people who dont like stealing elections,require real votes not fraud & rigging
@SenWarren @HouseDemocrats @GOP
shut up. No one buys it from you anymore you lying anti-American hypocrite
You mean to say that Democratic Party is clean of those who are indebted to Wall Street like its nominee
Liz you endorsed shillary who loves Wall Street
hope you are the VP. then there will be no doubt that this will get handled.
