HA! you only give a shit about the constitution when it advances your agenda hypocrite
what's wrong, trump do S this all the time!
you must be another brainwashed 2 party moron who equates disliking one party with liking the other. try thinking for yourself
expect this from trump supporter
yep 2 party moron. hint: I'm not a trump supporter idiot
you lost me at moron..thought u we're talking to ur self
yeah thinking independently is obviously something you don't do
r u even an US CITIZEN?
i think presidential candidates should be required to submit a minimum of 8 years tax returns, and a law degree would be a good idea, too
Do you really think lawyers make the best politicians? Lawyers are the main reason this country and its laws are so fucked up.
i can see your point & would be inclined to agree
'bad' attorneys are responsible for their bad image
@POTUS has to be educated in usa law
Like JFK, LBJ, Carter? opps none were lawyers. President is enforcing the law, not creating or interpreting it.
so what's the problem? you want a president that doesn't know law? or is a law degree too hard? pesky ethics get in the way for you?
Even this wench you admire is a straight out liar about things as is the wench she supported for President.
oh, you accusing someone of being a liar. isn't that ironic?
Warren has lied, or do you honestly think she is part native American. Clinton lied about her grandparents origins. Both LIED.
He has to be impeached immediately, or the Constitution is just a piece of parchment.
Detail his "treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors" considering that he hasn't even been sworn in yet.
Jan. 20th, the second after he takes his oath.
You still have yet to detail a single "treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors". Just another libtarded parrot.
Did you care abt. Clinton Found. getting donations from ppl while HRC was SoS? Yes? Then you're a total hypocrite.
Did you?
Sure. Read both sides. Do you care about Trump's biz pay-to-play influencing & enriching him @ America's expense?
@MizGee63 @realDonaldTrump There are over 65 million Americans who voted against Illegitimate BLOTUS, Sen. Warren, we r ready 2go
Just toss the cheeto in jail then.
Whatever you say, Pocahontas. Are you gonna give back all that money you stole in pretending to be Native American?
And YOUR experience with following the Constitution is____________?
@jmwrc1 @ChaseCaster @SkMccmr @Shortpixy @Dewbeeone Gee u guys, It must hurt to have your head that far up your butt 

But Hillary totally belongs, right? Nothin like a criminal for pres!  #moron
Who do you think is in the WH now. An accused child molester. Someone that has stolen thousands from working men and women. Someone that could care less about the working man. I can't understand how anyone can believe let alone follow him and still look themselves in a mirror
Somebody told me the you were a child molester.  Easy to  say, but that doesn't make it true.  Think about that  actuallyi I don't believe her
Think about this....Bob....you just popped up here with only 14 followers.  Had to block you.
I believe this is called politics for a political gain .
Why is Trump allowed to enter the Whitehouse without blind trust? Law Logan Act
Not everyone can parlay a lie into wealth and success like your claim to NAI heritage; if U can't prove your lineage it's lack of integrity.
you seriously need to get a treason case together, ASAP.
Warren, it's the DEMOS that don't follow the Constitution (Obummer & Clinton Cartel!)
please check the law Elisabeth the President doesn't have to divest his holdings-he is giving up his salary- r u
Go Liz we love you!!!
@DeanLeh @realDonaldTrump will you stand with @RepBarbaraLee & @repjohnlewis and boycott the inauguration?
PLEASE stop him!! With Putin compromising election & Trump treason, we deserve NEW VOTE!

yes! Hold him accountable! And I want to see your taxes!
, What is the status of the bill?
So now it's suddenly important that #POTUS follows the #Constitution ? Where have you been for the last 8 years #Fauxcahontas ?
Jesus, Chief Lying Water, shut the hell up. You're no better than Trump is.
Like you did when Obama didn't follow the Constitution.  What hypocrisy!
or impeach
@DeanLeh @realDonaldTrump this republican congress could care less what DT does!  They have an agenda against American people
Elizabeth Warren is the biggest LIGHTWIGHT in Washington!
Funny, you never complained about Obama ignoring the Constitution?  @SenWarren=hypocrite.
You never Questioned BHO walking all over the Constitution.
TRUMP WILL STAND UP FOR THE CONSTITUTION ! WE HAVE LAWS THAT OBAMA DOES NOT ENFORCE ! SHOULD I SPELL THEM OUT ?
M    A    S    S    H    O    L    E
NOW you are concerned about the Constitution!?  Please, u don't want to open that door
@Solar_Dancer @realDonaldTrump Thank you for continuing to fight for us. #TheResistance
We need to stop this freak. Before he ruins this ALREADY great nation.
Our best chance 2 do that is by following Indivisible I don't think the inauguration will be stopped
I wish they'd be more aggressive wth the investigation. It seems so real.
Trump may fire those people and replace them with his own. Investigation over. #TheResistance
On Day One DT will be in violation  of Constitution. He is spitting on our democracy.    What will it take to get him impeached?!
Yea because congress did a great job the last 8 years >.> #getgood
yes!
U mean like @POTUS did??! Look in the mirror & have ACCOUNTABILITY why y LOST. Nothing out of ur mouth matters.
If I could offer up some recommended reading for the Senator... https://www.amazon.com/Laymans-United-States-Constitution-Attitudes/dp/1499134746/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&qid=1484408264&sr=8-11&keywords=Imholt â€¦
Where were you when Obama was going unconstitutional every other day with his pen and phone 
I believe you are evil personified. I can't wait for you to shut up and let people do their jobs. You're an embarrassment.
- give me a break -- you make me want to throw up. Please leave Washington with Obama.
like how Barry the Inept followed the Constitution? Did you EVER question any of his moves Fauxcahonits?
Like you did with the outgoing King in his own mind Pocahontas?!
Do not allow @realDonaldTrump to bi-pass the laws, regulations, and ethics already in place!
when does this idiots 15 min of bullshit end?
...when I say??!!
Regarding the campaign donation from LLBean to Donald Trump wasn't the amount in excess of the amount allowed
Since when do democrats follow the law or the Constitution. You all make up the rules as you go along.
Sen. Warren: America needs you now more than ever before!!
ppl that voted 4 him knew he had businesses world wide. He shd not sell them bc he is POTUS. Investigate Clinton
ppl  picked do not need money or the headaches of govmt. They r there 4 ppl. Govmt has squandered our taxes
do u get the msg ppl do not want politicians 2 run country. Politicians have lined their pockets 4 yrs.
disturbing-as American citizen w/ views & values other than Pres-elect I'm considered more an enemy than Putin
so reassuring to have someone like you fighting for what is right in such strange times. Thank you Sen Warren!
I will dig up dirt on u. You are a bad person, your fruit reveals your purpose.
you and your communist dem conrades sat by while Obama shreaded the Constitution. Sit down & shut up. 
 @realDonaldTrump
Lol... its you and your corrupt cronies who are shredding the constitution... what a dummy.
Isnt this something after 8 yrs of corruption by democrats now @SenWarren now worries about Constitution hahaha.

he will. And that day will be your worst day, becuase you won't have anything to fight him
Please Senator Warren Obama needs to call state of emergency ! Seriously Putin is paying Flynn and Trump ! Stop
YAY!! Way to Go Sen. Warren
@JohnCornyn @tedcruz this is good for ALL parties!!  Please support
@POTUS @SenJohnMcCain Is anyone with any power at all going to stop the inauguration? Stop it now before it's too late to save us
Trump doesn't follow rules. Never has. Never will

@MAHAMOSA @realDonaldTrump too bad you didn't fight your Wall Street pals with that same passion.
I love you and your hard work ! Thanks for protecting #America !!
alright!!  I know @SenWarren will keep the donald accountable to the people.  Thank you Sen Warren
so U gonna give up your $5mil House & UR $14.5 million dollar fortune? So Y doesn't this bill effect Senators?
@Yolie_Rios @realDonaldTrump that would be a welcome change
Don't stop the fight, We The People need Congress to uphold the Constitution.
If the Constitution actually mandates what you say, why the need for the bill, Fauxahontas?
Must include Congress then.
LOOOOOL, all the sudden Fauxcahotas is for the constitution as written.
A law is not a part of the Constitution. You do know that right?

But you'll back a democrat pres who doesn't follow the constitution...
.@SenWarren thank you for your bill to hold @realDonaldTrump accountable
thank you Senator Warren
Hope to see you in Washingtonon January 21st Senator Warren.
U BET!
He is committing treason, Senator
Shocked this was never law. So obvious.
Pocahontas it's going to be a long 8 years
Congress is a major problem, this really concerns me.
As you know we are organizing in every major city in the country for January 21.
What would be the most effective thing for us to do?
We are mobilizing and ready to organize and do what needs to be done to push this bill through.
please keep pressing hard for us normal hard working people. Thank you for doing your job!  The rest of congress needs to follow!
a great idea but a snowball's chance in hell. thanks for trying.
Are you serious? Where have you been for the last 8 years demanding that Barack Obama follow the Constitution?
You have my support. Should make mandatory as well as publishing tax returns. No conflicts, high standards.
Bitter Barry's Pen and Phone?...Hypocrite much?
Good luck passing this, you lost the house for this kind of stupidity. You're rigging the system like Dems do.
ashame u r not looking out for the ppl but u r looking at your own personal agenda u sound so uneducated
we The People are waiting on you and the rest of the Dems on a pedastal to do the same
You look like sore losers circumventing what the people voted for. You're a threat to democracy and dangerous.
Elizabeth Warren in on the war path again.
you're going to need help, how can I help?
Thank You, Senator! We need to make TP respect the U.S.A.and Congress. Yesterday he was acting weird!
#congress should follow up just like they did with the current administration and unconstitutional action
let Obama run free, now constitutionalist? Politics #disgusting #bs
so does he need to sell his home? Oh Goody, only homeless ppl can run for office.
WHEN DO YOU STAND UP AND TAKE ON WHAT THE CLINTONS DID? HUH? THAT WAS CORRUPTION!
He did exactly what he has to do. He left himself something to go to when he is done.HE is breaking NO LAWS!
Obama trashed the Constitution again and again and again while you CHEERED HIM ON! so nope. not now lizzy
Hey how many in Congress became millionaires due to their being IN congress?  You're just a HATER you liberal witch
isn't that adorable you thinking you and your tiny group have a say. Your gonna have a long 4 years
you're a total disgrace voting against exception for #GeneralMattis show us your #Harvard application #Fraud !
Every single step without fail!
go home & quit whining Pocahontas.
If Trump doesn't have to follow the Constitution, why should any of us?
The US Congress doesn't know who it works for. Until they care for their constituents vote for #NoIncumbents.
Like Pocahontas cares one crap about following the constitution after Obama has TRASHED it for the last 8 years!
If he is violating the constitution, then DO something!  Supreme Court involvement! Congress needs to stop the real problem.
, and if @SenWarren continues to demagogue EVERYTHING SHE CAN, she needs to be voted out of office.
.@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Put a lid on it Pocahontas
you do not have the votes Lizzie
give 1 dollar to Trump?  r u fuckin serious, BITCH? get a life, & go flip a couple of houses 4 a penny on a buck
you are hilarious thankfully you are irrelevent now
@jimmyj48125 @realDonaldTrump right well controlled by the new Republicans who don't care pass nighttime laws eliminating ethics
Senator, there is a vast array of depts, programs and $ spent that have nothing to do with Constitution. Why?
So glad to see you fighting back against Ben Carson who has no business being put into this job
...if EW truly supported America, she would have supported Gen Mattis.  You are as mad at Baby Booker!
It would be nice if you would have attacked HRC in such ways as our upcoming POTUS. Drain the swamp.
Go, Senator, we are with you all the way!
Congress won't. Nobody is going to do anything. The bigger question is, "Why the hell not?"
no to Ben Carson. Tired of Trump cashing in on American people. Puts Carson in so he can Rubber Stamp funds
you wouldn't have given a care about conflicts of interest if your pal HRC had won. Partisan hack!
Sen. Warren represents the very best characteristics of a U.S. Senator.  Bravo.
@dianaaitchison @realDonaldTrump Hold them to it Senator. We're counting on you.
- I'm amazed that this man can get away with all he has and still be PEOTUS. Where's your backbone USA?
It's time to call the "Democratic Party" "The Party of Progressives" Nothing more, nothing less!
if he won't follow the constitution imagine tbe chaos with his people following suit
AND stop the division, start finding common ground. Stop looking out the window and start looking in the mirror.
Did you actually hear his lawyer speak at the presser yesterday? Maybe a new law 'encouraging' reps divest?
@SenWarren shaddup, #shillforsoros.
@SenWarren I live in mass, and will make sure you are NOT re-elected. Go back to Oklahoma #carpetbagger.
From listening to @SenWarren, on Gen. Mattis confirmation, you don't want a leader, you want a yes man. Ur a #Disgrace @realDonaldTrump
only @POTUS was your concern there darling.
As a senator you understand he is within his constitutional rights, so your LYING!!
Yes Sen Warren keep on fighting dont let the Bully knock you down
Please fight back at this raging disappointment of a presididnt-elect by all means possible.
really? Congress is gonna 'fight back' ? Please, what did the US Senate do last night? @SenWarren @WeAreAlreadyGr1 @realDonaldTrump
Wake up Warren. Go spend your $15M in that $5M home. Where did you get your $$$. Sign me up next Sen. of MA!
I'll get my local OFA chapter on this immediately. Any chance of an Obama EO on this?
You're an embarassment to this gov't. Resign.  Only someone as corrupt as you will malign folks like Dr. Carson
thank you Ms Warren I m not in ur state but would keep u as a career politician for life
About time, I couldnâ€™t work a single a day for a federal judge w/o taking an oath promising to comply w/ the emoluments clause
He wonâ€™t. And they wonâ€™t. @SenWarren
And if @realDonaldTrump wonâ€™t follow the Constitution, Congress must fight back every step of the way. http://www.warren.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=1342 â€¦ 
run in 2020 plz
what are you doing with the riots in your prisons & drug addicts? thousands of dems left your party in Mass.
Get Over yourself Senator, your party Lost, stop with this childish behavior 
so when have you or any democrat been concerned with #Constitution? #shutupsitdown #Fauxcohontas #corruptDNC
We are with you @SenWarren Go get them. Keep them in check.
Thank you!
#ROD - Resist! Obstruct! Deny!
As stated earlier @CNN We are perplexed by Senator's Warren logic.
YES, Senator Warren, yes.  Fight!
maybe you should've sent this to Obama as well 8 yrs ago... 
you are BATSHIT crazy. Obama shat on the #Constitution and you said NOTHING! #Hypocrite #Maga and FIRE #LizardBreathWarren
where are your tax returns?
@Alba_Dawn @realDonaldTrump If he can't comply with the law, he isn't presidential material!!. DICKtator Trumpty Dumbty'!!.
Many this can help!     https://youtu.be/FFroMQlKiag 
Sen. Warren. Obama didn't follow the US Constitution. Where were you when he didn't?  SILENCE! HYPOCRIT!!
The conflict of interest is outrageous! Why are they getting away with this and where are the tax returns?
Yes, everyone must! @ChrisVanHollen @BenCardin @SenSchumer
pull back the curtain on his finances mom!
Keep him honest @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH!!! NOW GET BACK TO WORK!!!!!
DOA, lady....
Funny how this bill doesn't apply to members of CONGRESS and their immediate families. You all line your pockets while in office.
