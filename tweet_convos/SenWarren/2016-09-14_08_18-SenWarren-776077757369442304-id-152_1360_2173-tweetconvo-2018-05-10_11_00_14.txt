Should we Parade all your Travel In Front of the Massachusetts Voters Senator Warren ?
What about the POTUS taking the whole month off to campaign for Hillary! Works both ways!
@dshine2you @SenateGOP they should be 50% of the time doin what they do & the other, doin what we all do.

#originals
But...but.......but......they've got corporate asses to kiss!
this calendar is all wrong.... The red days are actually the days Obama is playing golf #DOYOURJOB
@dwaynecobb @SenateGOP why are we paying these people?!
And the @SenateDEMS are off at the same time your point is pointless get a real job! America is smarter than you!
that's because they know it does not require a vote and it can't be veto by President Obama
Why is the Senate not paid hourly?
because, nobody would want the job, all pay, no hours, however, there are some, such as @SenWarren who do us well
Another reason nothing gets done in the Senate. #HFA
Can I get their schedule if I only bilk the country for 25% of their salary? 
#LazyMoochers
They should be required to be present. Absurdity. Fast food workers sweat harder than a Sen. No work, no pay!
@myjojo122 well the prez is off to yet another country to tell them how stupid and lazy you are...so... Even the dems
@wrap02 @SenateGOP it's not gonna matter about the Senate if Trump gets elected, we're f**ked !
don't they spend time in their home states doing the peoples' business there?  I thought you were smarter than that.
This is absurd !  I guess if i could work half a year and make $174.000 i would be all in . GOP=SOB
#DoYourJob by breaking up Felon Credit Suisse & NTT & abolishing #immunity 4 judges, thanks 2 #Persky & countless more
Availability is a prerequisite to being successful in any occupation. No wonder nothing gets done in Washington.
@BenSasse Sen. Sasse, would you please explain this fact to me? Thank you. Respectfully Liz Johnson
And you will not be taking a break?
to many breaks and get paid to much for they work for themselves and not the people
you're certainly no better
1% sets schedule, paid for house and Senate will continue status quo, no action means wealth flow going up, tyvm...
wow, I can't even take a vacation, they can't even do their job.
I can only wish for that kind of leisure! #realwork
Senator Warren will you please model for your colleagues and prove what you do for us even when out of session?
excuse me but isn't they include you?
But you're one of them too...aren't you?
Pitiful. #DoYourJob #IHaveToDoMine
this is disgusting. I do want my money back!they should not be paid for all this time off. Highway robbery
Fired!!
unbelievable

Ah, yes. Those critics of welfare & other entitlement programs. Entitled, much?
ALONE!!!!!!!
both houses do not to be in session but about twice a year. The rest of the time, go on about your lives and leave us.
You would think Bill would be past his hound dog days by now. #DickinBimbos #DNCleaks
#guncontrol #Zika Etc... DO YOU JOB.. #Flipitdem and lets get some work done!!!!!
Why is this happening! ? How do we change this?? Elizabeth keep up the good fight!
Give US our money back, for day not at work.
Keep em honest Liz! 
When HRC wins what would you like to be involved/chair of?????
Banking or kicking ass?!
wish this was my work schedule (with no reduction in pay)!
Truth is,down-ballots running scared to home to counteract Trump http://loss.How  they'll run on their record?
quick, send in a few Zika mosquitoes before they leave for their rest
Wow, must be nice!!! Get em Liz!!!
#pinkslips
Red days = Not in session. Blue days = "NO." @SenWarren @francie57 @SenateGOP
Calling the kettle black, Senator.
@marcrubio Senators, please help the House pass a clean Zika bill to help Floridians before you take another vacay.
@francie57 @SenateGOP the Republican held Senate and Congress refuse to do their jobs because there is a black president. Face it
We want our $ back there should be rule if they don't work they don't get paid like most of America.
Unbelievable!!!
surprised they don't start following Finland's 6 hour work day model. #workworkwork #doyourjob
Strange that YOU a senator do not know the Senate's job. Shame on you.
this is ridiculous and unacceptable.
sen warren i.m in your state involved with standing rock why why no support from you sen warren
they call her Pocahontas +bully+theirpower$ shes layn low on ndn issues but we need her suport #waterislife
must be that betterway they have been talking about
@WLD01 disgraceful selfish lot
if that was us regular ordinary people we would be fired... like yesterday.
Why can't the #voters see through the "do nothing" #GOP controlled #Senate?
Why do they get all of October? The holidays don't start till late November. What a sham.
Good. Less time for Congress to inflict harm on the American people.
Omg, I need that job, Actually it is shameful with all the work they need to get done, Democrats are willing to work!
Yet another example of government creation of an elite class of public employees. Health Ins, pension, insider trading

Since you are itching to work will you inquire why The President sent billions to a Iran without anyone's knowledge??
They are worthless!
pathetic That is y nothing gets done in DC.Who needs congress let local leaders meet with president.time2streamline
:(  When did being a Senator become a PT job? More recesses than a kindergarten.
What the hell? How much are we paying them in dollars and perks?
they get paid to go on vacation. Wish the American people where so fortunate! Tax $s & greased palms vote them out!
@SpeakerRyan ARE YOU PEOPLE INSANE?  You don't deserve to represent people who work 50 wks, 40+/hrs per week. Shame!
@SenCoryGardner Hey Cory Gardner - what do you do? No zika? No SCOTUS? Just eating fudge and fundraising?
It's almost like the GOP believes the only way to prove the government doesn't work is by refusing to do the job.
term limits.
because they r too busy raising $ and working w lobbyists for their best interests
This is the business of Congress...getting re-elected. This is another thing that campaign finance reform would fix!
You don't understand. When the GOP is in session they fuck over the American people. Let them keep their break.
: #DISGRACEFUL!
I'm #disgusted with @SenateGOP! @SenateMajLdr, #DoYourJob!

Oh forget it! ---> #VoteGopOutOfOffice!
If they got pd for wht they did or time off no pay-lets vote them out time they work 4 living like the rest of us do
What a joke.
Congress of nothing.
our government is an embarrassing lying bunch of idiots
Looks like the same schedule as when the Democrats were in charge. You are a Hypocrite.
sweet gig if you can get it
12 days over October and November? What?
doesn't work re: @marcorubio #rarelyworks except for himself.
#electPatrickMurphyforSenate get a #problemsolver
@PattyMurray and WE the People are getting ready to VOTE!  Time to put end to Congressional Welfare and Food Stamps!
Vote them out of office! This is ridiculous! #voteoutgop
Dock their pay.  Don't show up, don't get paid. Just like the rest of US.
How can Republicans do their job when they support the most dangerous racist man in the world
oh Lizzie..Preparing to again screech that Trump is a money-grubber? Delicious irony as you share the stage w/@HillaryClinton $$
stop all politians pay till Congress does all the work required to balance budget, not kick it down rd.
#Ridiculousness #unacceptablebehaviour
Please get to work and try to find COMMON ground!
they are just following the lead of our president on vacation 24/7/365
whiny warren
The Senate is only in-session for FOUR days in October? WTF???!!! #TaxDollarsNOTAtWork
Elected officials taking breaks instead of working, sounds like business as usual to me. #ProfessionalPoliticalClass
You've already spent way more $ then we have. It's better you don't go to work.
So are you an Indian or not. Did you steal a Harvard faculty position from a minority set aside?
I'd like to get paid for not working. How about instituting a Per Diem? It was good enough for our founding fathers.
Congress should have no benefits if they are not working just like average Americans
quick count: out of session 217 days a year. WTF?
grrr #DoYourJob
As much as I understand this, aren't they also supposed to be in their disctricts? Not just DC?
um, aren't those RED days also for when Democrat Senators are also not in work?
I Say its time to fire them and hire some senators & congressmen who actually work!!
great argument to reduce the size of govt.
#They don't work. #Dems & R's
surey you realize hoidays are also for democrats, and that there was a dem supermajority only 6 years ago, right?
Except it was under the GOP majority they extended the days off
extended holidays by how much? and with what votes? (actual question)
like this http://www.politico.com/blogs/the-gavel/2015/11/house-2016-schedule-215476 …
should be paid only for days they actually work! Oh wait.... that would mean they get $0
lazy corrupt on the take worthless total waste of taxpayer money best Congress money can buy
Hiw about a resolution for Trump to withdraw? #Eichenwald
Aren't you part of the U.S. Senate? Demand change!
absolutely disgusting
The GOP does less damage when they are out of session. They sure do like recess more than a kindergartener though.
Speaks Volumes
yet they keep getting reelected. Go figure?
#Democrats work on Christmas Eve (not lameduck) http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/25/health/policy/25health.html?_r=0 …
Dear Senator, the same question I ponder for why, with your track record, you would support @HillaryClinton over @BernieSanders
Let's see the schedule each year for the past 10 years so we can analyze the truth.
They might as well stay away alltogether
get this. #Pocahontas thinks war party needed
aren't @TheDemocrats also away campaigning at that time?
Miss Warren I wrote you re: student loan bogus practice concern please help me
this is unreal. Do your jobs. Disgrace
Congressmsn and Senators first, people they represent, second.
This is an OUTRAGE #DoYourJob!
the less you clowns in Congress do the better.
Cushy job. Well paid too--good benefits
