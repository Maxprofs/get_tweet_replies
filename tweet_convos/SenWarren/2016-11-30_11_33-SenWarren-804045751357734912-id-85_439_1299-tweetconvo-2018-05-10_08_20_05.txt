.@SenWarren it'sad that the term "cures" is even in the title of the Act as our priority should be "prevention". Congress is idiotic.
Congress is a bunch of ugly corrupt white guys trying to get enough money to get laid through economic force.
says the white woman 
you're a #Nastywoman  my God do you kiss your kids with that mouth!!
If only cussing were the least of your offenses.
stop projecting #deplorable.
Better than being driven insane by these https://www.google.com/patents/US8494641 …. You suppose the covert use of one these is curing anyone?
We treat Farm animals better than this https://www.google.com/patents/US8494641 …
Tell me Senator should I delete my account for saying something about it? Or just accept the continued noise in my ear?
If we feel threatened or angry while being resonated what then?  Prison,  a Park bench?
What do we call those afflicted by this https://www.google.com/patents/US8494641 … Troubled?  A nuisance?  Or Gay and not conforming to conversion?
So far I've been noised out of college 3 times. My bank account is drained and I'm not as nice as I used to be.
How long do you think you would last walking around with resonating https://www.google.com/patents/US8494641 … noise in your ear?
Certainly I never gave consent. I had a tooth extracted
Please reconsider and vote yes. I'm your constituent as is my son with autism. Like so many other disorders, we need research.

Thank you. We’re all refreshed and challenged by your unique point of view.
wHere on earth did u get urviews, not in Teen
this bill sounds more like attempted murder with the excuse of making money.
Please keep talking about HR34 21st Century Cures Act. Encourage people to call their senator.
I agree with you! I hope @SenSchumer ,@SenGillibrand do too!!! Thank you!

@SusanMaylone @YouTube Sorry lost believe & respect for DEM'S party. I don't believe I am alone in this. 
Thank you, Senator Warren. We'll see a lot of drugs that don't work & are unsafe get on the market if this bill passes.
The American people also deserve politicians who dont make closed door deals with SOROS & take huge sums of his money!
@HillaryClinton 
@POTUS 
@HSMChicago 
@BernieSanders 
@MikeBloomberg
@BethWeber1
@MichelleObama
@WarrenBuffett
you're a liar. We want to know how much you take from SOROS & what direction he gave you!! #Pocahontas @YouTube @CNN #sorosagenda

Thank you for your passion. Thank you for your mission and hard work. Thank you for taking care of us!
at one point the Democrats had the house the Senate and the presidency how come you guys didn't do anything
Whats NOT in Cures Bill is "Bipartisan Mine Workers Pension Act" enacted 70yr ago to take care of Health/Welfare of Coal Miners!
Cures Bill added provision to make it easier for drug co's to off label market fraud! 100K signed petition to reject this Bill!
This Cures Bill generated more lobbyists than all 11,000 Bills that have been proposed in this Congress & They want Big favors!
: This Bill is about what Drug Co's & Donors want, not what the American people want.
21st CC Act held common sense bipartisan health proposals HOSTAGE unless Congress agreed to PASS giant giveaways to Drug Co's!
@SenatorShaheen Written by 1400 lobbyists...
Nor on what the DNC did during the primary. The only Dem in congress who spoke out was Tulsi Gabbard.
-- better keep an eye on that Price guy. Seems like he's all about helping dr's, Pharos and insurance co's over patients.
No one cares what you say until you stand up for Standing Rock.  You are increasingly looking like a fraud.
You oppose anything that may make the opposition look competent.
Thank you for fighting. Section 12006 would cause a HUGE problem for the disabled and providers . 
Please keep fighting!
@SenSanders @realDonaldTrump I signed petition:)
what's your plan tax us more get a life the more you rant the dumber you sound
-YES. So what's the solution? Pls explain.
-Awaiting an answer pls 
Nope. The voters get what they deserve.
#NoDAPL
@cykelly1718 @YouTube put a hold on every appointee of Trump please !!
This bill is a blend of good and evil. Pray for those who must suffer the evil.
