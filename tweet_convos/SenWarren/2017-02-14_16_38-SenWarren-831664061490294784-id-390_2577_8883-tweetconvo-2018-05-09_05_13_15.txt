When you shut down ads, fewer people sign up. Now Humana is pulling out of the exchanges. They don’t have enough healthy young ppl enrolled.
.@realDonaldTrump & the @GOP should stop these reckless actions to hurt the ACA before they hurt even more people who need health coverage.
I have a son who received Obamacare for a while--and he couldn't even find a decent doctor--much less care!
Useless pieces of 
Pieces of crap make the soil fertile. Crap is offended, Lexie!
So true! I'm ashamed of being an American since these hypocrites have taken over our country.
I'm saying again! 36 yr RN, Smart, took 7 hrs to eval ACA plans! Survey &you'll find ppl didn't understand
Almost everyone I talked w didn't understand whick plan was best 4 them! Flipped coin & picked bad plans!
Very poor roll out & lack of patience! We KEPT OUR DOCS, 61 y/o PD $161/mo , Deductible $2230!  NOT BAD!!
When you read btw the lines...Obamacare is doing a pretty fair job of sabotaging itself!
and you are working around the clock sabotaging the trump administration.    Step down nasty woman.
tell #45 to STEP DOWN

@potus..oh calm down lizzy before you give yourself a nose bleed.  Obamacare is crapcare-stop blaming
And you've worked around the clock taking hundreds of thousand of dollars from college students. #hypocrisy
Thank God, I work and can't afford the premiums and either can the ex Marine, it's a Joke!!!!
ITS impossible to sabotage obamacare. aca and dems destroyed americans healthcare.
Oh come on, you KNOW companies were pulling out WAY before Trump. Why are you always lying?
ACA is collapsing under its own weight. Better to replace it now rather than to wait for complete failure.
So, Squats with Unions says its the GOPs fault. Maybe they should have included the GOP when they passed it
OBAMACARE WILL ONLY FAIL REALLY QUICKLY WHEN THEY REPEAL ALL/SOME OF IT, WEIRD HOW THAT WORKS
even your constituants have heard of #Obamacare SAVE THE MONEY - no secret, it's going away!
LAME-O
Republicans can never be trusted..
a independent investigation is a must all involved in Russian scandal must be exposed
all of these things are just a large smokescreen to keep protecting his ties with Russia. And businesses
Once again, nothing gets past u.
Thank you for fighting  for us. You are AWESOME! We will PERSIST  with you !
What do you suggest Liz?  Do what Dems do which is nothing and let it die on its own? Can't blame Rs 4 ACA
@GlambertStan @realDonaldTrump @GOP @ the moment, I'm more concerned w/ #comradeTrump & #GOP being fucking #traitors! #russiagate
A vague ACA order?  This from the party of "You have to pass this bill to see what's in it" #MAGA
sometimes you can be smart but most of the time you are the opposite and a waste of tax dollars @realDonaldTrump @GOP will agree
Thank you for fighting, Elizabeth!  We appreciate you so much!  Please get the Russian ties out front too
be quiet Pocahontas!!!
u be quiet Pocahontas.
They have been working on a new plan for 8 years where is it
are you still talking. Sit down
The Unaffordable Not Healthcare is NOT Healthcare!
I have faith President Trump will in do time repeal & replace once all the pieces are in place .
It's really easy to criticize I found that out in the Navy it's a lot harder to provide solutions.
Yes isn't it great the 'nightmare' of Obamacare is almost over...ohh that is so sweet.
omg just go away
so stupid to spend $ on ads
talk to my parents who can no longer afford medication thanks to #Obamacare
YOU KEEP LYING & STEALING  TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU DID ABOUT YOUR HERITAGE...MERKEL WANNABE
I know this is off topic, but has anybody seen Sarah Palin?
The longer this goes on the more I think Obama care isn't going anywhere.
.@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @GOP &
.@seanhannity Just trying to stop U CON artists from shifting the tax BURDEN even further from the GROSSLY OVERPAID http://www.liberalforum.org/index.php?/topic/162455-we-need-more-tax-brackets;-not-fewer/?p=1059718565 … 
Time to retire Warren. TERM LIMITS!!!!
oh my!  Dishonest women
Don't let them destroy healthcare for millions. ACA, Medicare, Medicaid are necessary for the health of all
Exactly and markets do not like instability.   GOP cannot govern whatsoever!
wants a larger pool of sick and poor. This is by design.
he doesn't realize how many people are going to suffer
the @POTUS is waiting for direction from the Kremlin.
the ACA ads & website needed.Some of us will be losing COBRA  mid year, need ability to enroll
the ACA sabotaged itself
I will be soo happy when u r voted out!You do nothing but sew hate among Americans!
.@SenWarren @GOP Speak it Senator. Don't forget what .@marcorubio did to sabotage the #ACA with reconciliation. He's why costs skyrocketed!
Trump/GOP are a cancer to our democracy!  They need to be removed!
.@SenWarren YOU sabotage millions kids w/your lies! Draining swamp of YOU & toxic vaccines http://youtu.be/xijjls2axCM  #VAXXED #CDCwhistleblower

hey #pocahontas, I can see your cheekbones being a clear indication for your Indian heritage. Lol
Thank you @SenWarren & your team for fighting for us. @realDonaldTrump @GOP are out to destroy us w/ their crooked one-sided policies.
@BrandiMorganHa @realDonaldTrump @GOP the healthcare passed, not read and failed? Takes time to create REAL working healthcare
that alone should be considered treason against the American people.
Elizabeth, you are not a good leader.
Something wrong with your legs as you, Clinton, Pelosi only wear pants, that's not feminine.
SENATOR  ........You are so DEVIL.
so I can't afford Obamacare. Fining me $700+ is waaayyy more affordable for NOT having it...PYSCHE!! REPEAL!
Don't back down. We need more people like you. #resist #ShePersisted #Neverthelessshepersisted
@ForgottenProf @realDonaldTrump @GOP This is what happens when you ram legislation. ACA=failure. Stop looking to gov to save u
so is this replacing obama care with "something" better or more" just say something to pacify ? "
Obummercare is about to be Replaced..Put a TAX hike on American people and then leave the Senate out... Nice...
remember fauxcohontas, you have to pass the bill so you can read the bill.
But does either side have a plan to improve ACA? I have yet to hear one and Americans lose in this deadlock
I hope we are concentrating on how to make it Affordable vs just access to medical insurance.TY
@GO. Let's cut out these alternative facts like DJT camp in  bed with Russian before election
Impeach them all!
why can't Repubs and Dems actually work together on this?  That's the solution to the healthcare problme
Democratic tactics..name calling, slander, rioting, protesting , filibustering,  racial slurs, lying , cry
- These people make me sick! Ms. Warren, we need Bernie now.
Pocahontas you have work around the clock trying to take down the legitimate government of this country.
then the Democratic party should run the ads!
why won't you join your coworker Bernie Sanders and help push for a single-payer healthcare system?? Why no
& in Mass our health care is so corrupt w/no investigations that Bermuda is taking Lahey to court. Nice job
well at least they are working hard at something 
If a fraction of effort spent on repealing went into REPAIRING  a solution FOR ALL could be had.
#RepairACA
@nlfisker @realDonaldTrump @GOP Red states are red. Blue states are blue. In 2018 GOP. Were coming for you! Red states  w/ GOP 2
Trump supporters are too stupid grasp how badly they fked the USA by voting him in. Sad!
and sign up for the ACA. We all know you can afford it because the rest of us working people can't!
here's an idea senator warren ....if the ACA is so great then you give up your fully paid govt insurance
Please fight for us to continue to have our health care. Thank you.
Trump promised he would. That's why he won the election. Get over it, your  bad policies are finished.
Obama sabotaged reform when abandoned single payer system. Healthcare Industrial Complex. Sine qua non etc.
what they should be worried about more than the Repeal of ACA is saving our govt from a total collapse!
Donald J. Trump and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence
Let's deal with this after the whole treason, colluding with the russian gov, and the debacle that is trump WH.
#IAM ... #antichrist
http://raginedwards.com/why-ragin  guys!house open in a district we can win! Donate & phone canvas now! Election is in april! Lets #resist!!

I just want to tell you Elizabeth Warren that I predict you'll have a Stroke soon.Calm down lady! Looking scary
Sorry warren my Mom needs Better insurance than Obamacare that she cNt afford let alone the fine!
yeah, he won on that very platform
Someone needed to produce private enrollment ads. Here in CA, we still had our ad. Have to be proactive!
@bbkenn92 @POTUS @GOP Despicable, deplorable, disgusting actions by the political party with no health plan of its own.
does Russia have a national healthcare system?
Please write a bill to IMPEACH TRUMP! And all his cronies for Treason!
it's better than before, but it's just a handout to the insurance companies. Single payer now!
and Elizabeth they have nothing to replace it.. So sad.. The America people r in trouble!!
Do you really believe this???  Folks getting tired of this repetitive disaster rhetoric.
it's like they want to destroy anything and everything before they are STOPPED! Banish them all
They are trying to sabotage the program so they can come to the rescue #UnfitToLead
LOL, Obamacare pretty much sabotaged healthcare. What are YOU talking about.
they are also sabotaging American values and decency. Demand full investigation. Thanks for persistence!
#reTrumplicanCare #tRumpDontCare #GOPFailCare  The GOP says they kill ObamaCare, ok big boys, kill it,OWNit
Introduce withdrawal of the anti trust exemption that had capped insurer profit; constructive start.
You are a liar.
And did you notice ALL the other ads?  Ads for a nonexistent replacement & more & more HC insurance ads
TERM LIMITS
EVERY FIBER OF UR BEING SHOULD BE USED 2 GET RID OF TRUMP. EVERY WAKING MOMENT, THAT'S ALL U NEED TO DO
HERE'S THE SITUATION & I LUV U BUT U NEED TO GET RID OF TRUMP, FOCUS ON THAT. STOP GETTING DISTRACTED...
Oh that's right it's the GOP's fault! It does not work Elizabeth!
when you accomplish something as a senator let it be known. Otherwise shut your mouth
Outrageous.
they have worked to defraud the US. Repeal and replace ALL Republicans, i.e. Traitors to our country!
please get that lying traitor out of OUR White House!!!
Dems need to face charges of sedition. ENOUGH of this
Just as important is Humana very concern that the Trump admin has no plan!
let all of trump and the Republican actions not exhaust you, let each violation be the power that drives the left further onward.
How about protect and strengthen instead of repeal and replace, @realDonaldTrump @GOP? That goes for ACA, Medicare, Medicaid
ACA saved my life. @GOP doesn't care ppl will lose homes & lifetime savings to make BigPharma & Insurance richer
They "won't know what they lost til it's gone" then there will be a real #revolt #vote2018
#Godhelpus
you Alt Left liberals passed obamacare without reading,left the mess for Trump to fix,he'll get r done
you are a racist and a sexist lizzy.
it's not right having to pay a private company just to be a law abiding citizen
please repeal the fine for not having insurance.
I love you @SenWarren
Humana was already pulling out!! QUIT LYING!! Go back to your teepee!!
@MAHAMOSA @realDonaldTrump @GOP  we have the free media that works wonders. So whomever don't have ACA you can still enroll.
NO Senator Obama ruined healthcare
shame !
Treason #LockHimUp @GOP #LockThemUp ! And accessories to the Fact!
So much winning...
Is there a Russia spy ship off the East coast?  Ask the pres To tell his boy he's alright day can go home
so wrong!  Obamma Care is killing too many of us...not you senators and representatives!
sad many need good health care.  We will remember at election time
as a young black conservative I see through your lies Mrs.Warren
The ACA has helped me.  I don't understand why it' so unpopular.
Repeal and Run. Incompetent.  PT dishonest abt having a plan ready. Of course, his word is not good anyway.
OBAMA & DNC LIED FOR YEARS ABOUT OBAMACARE!  BACK OFF!
DNC should run ads for ACA if Trumpf and Republicants sabotage ad program. They can't stop enrollment.
Prayer aint gonna fix momma's diabetes...
