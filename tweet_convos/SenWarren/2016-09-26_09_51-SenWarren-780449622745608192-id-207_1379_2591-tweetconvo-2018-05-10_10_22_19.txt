@CNBC ask obama why he didnt indict a single banker. U endorse hillary who would never hurt a banker. Ever. They give her millons
what all hardworking people  should do is crowd fund #anonymous to redistribute the 1% 's wealth to every person equally on  
stumpf Will walk and Congress and the Senate will do Zip he should be in jail Wells Fargo should be close down
Should Obama step down when low-level employees in fed govt agencies are involved in corruption?  @SenWarren
Hillary Clinton did the same...and it was OK. Why not him ?
Someone give this lady the power to send people like this to prison!  You think @realDonaldTrump could prosecute like this?
Wells Fargo has been doing bad stuff to us for 18 months re:our mortgage so we had to hire an attorney.They need 2b investigated!
@CNBC there is no accountable for these people, he belongs in jail.
@CNBC Pay ratio now? CEO's made 30 times wh average worker made in 1970's.. Now CEO's make 300 times what average work is paid
@CNBC  what about senators who don't pass a budget bill as required by the Constitution for several years; they also resign.
Gee, can you live on that?  What a joke - but nobody's laughing.
@CNBC He is the  personification of crony capitalism. He should resign & face charges by the DOJ. $WFC @WellsFargo
WHAT ABOUT CLINTON, THE IRS, THE VA ETC...
You're supporting a criminal for President who FBI director let off the hook even tho he stated the reasons why she was guilty.
Are you really doing your job? This is an issue for directors and shareholders unless a crime was committed; @realDonaldTrump
same gourd for Hillary!
@CNBC Because you allow this to happen by supporting sell out @HillaryClinton , you are all talk,Turned you back on @SenSanders
that money ought to be split with extra for the whistleblowers and then to the 5000 fired who had no recourse
well,  do something about it.  I think you have the power.
I think John Stumpf should get ZERO - in fact should pay back everything since he was named CEO.

@CNBC as Trump puts it, "I am a business man, just using the laws to protect my business" #WhiteCollarMafia
@CNBC where is Warren Buffett on this mess ?
Investigate their whole company! Their all frauds. Trust me! We were going to be homeless because of them! WF doesn't work w/any1
@universe2519 @CNBC @realdonaldTrump was hoping you wouldn't ask THAT question,
why isn't he in jail
Uh, because #BillClinton can have sex with an intern in the White House and keep his job, because #Hillary can lie and keep going
OMG...no!
@CNBC   And I should have to repay my wells Fargo loan????
if the company he overseas broke the law, he is responsible for their actions and he needs to be in jail!
@CNBC if a person can lie about their Heritage to get elected why should we trust any politician?
Fake Indian Lady
@CNBC that's not fair.  If the average person did what strumf not only will they get fired.  More importantly, criminal charges.
@CNBC if Donald Trump can sell US Public Brooklyn Bridge, why should be expect the Republican Party to care about middle America
stand strong. Honesty at all levels, critical to democracy
@CNBC Don't you have better things to do than to tweet for a week about this guy??? Aren't you like a Senator or something...
You're such a grandstander. Why don't u do something about the illegal Gov takeover of FannieFreddie? #Fanniegate bigger than WF.
@CNBC BC SOS Clinton & her staff can  get away with lawlessness why can't he??
@CNBC if he broke the law, why can't he be prosecuted?
@CNBC he's walking away with a golden parachute BECAUSE OF YOU. You've failed the middle class.
Yuk and where is the information to consumers about what to do with their multiple WF accounts?
aren't you the kettle calling the pot black??Washington DC is full of criminals who DONT think they have to follow the law.right?
that's disgusting
#ThatsBullshit!
One of the many reasons that people do not respect the star spangled banner
@TeslaTrip @CNBC Because you've committed massive fraud and walked away with a lot more than that.
@CNBC damn, Wigwam Warren is on a warpath
This is outrageous. The CEO pay is just out of line with reality.
Yeah y would they when @HillaryClinton does the same things?
@CNBC if a person can be a fraud her whole life & become senator, how can we expect a Democrat to ever be honest?  #Fauxcahontas
@CNBC instead of saying, "you should go to jail," maybe charge him and put him there.
@CNBC same thing for a former Secretary of State and presidential candidate.
@CNBC we don't that is why you expect to support and provide funding to make him comply. Please get off the campaign trail
@CNBC Good point. If  @HillaryClinton can break the law as Sec of State why should we expect anyone to follow the law?
@CNBC he shouldn't get a dime!
@CNBC Golden parachute. Responsibility is a bitch.
hold Hillary accountable for her misdeeds and I might entertain your righteous indignation.
@CNBC  Duh!
Ms. SELLOUT HYPOCRITE you're backing HRC THE LAST PERSON ON EARTH WHO WOULD PROSECUTE WALL $T. #Jill2016
disgusting
Why did the CFPB not impose individual fines?
@CNBC 
This is what we should be concerned about why is nobody paying attention to this!!!!
they need that money to contribute to @HillaryClinton. For real change vote @realDonaldTrump #votetrump2016 #NeverHillary
What about #CrookedHillary and the massive #Corruption she is responsible for ? #DOinJ #TrumpTrain
@CNBC disgusting.
@CNBC if you don't agree with it, don't do business with them!
Go get him & lock him up.  That phrase should used for the all CEO's who commit corporate fraud/greed against the US tax payer
@CNBC $ 126.6 million if he walks ?!? My fellow Americans this is a "SIN & A SHAME" #therichgetsricher
.@SenWarren sadly, there is little evidence we expect any CEO to follow the law today. People are saying they hope you can change that.
KKKlinton has my back and shes defrauded Americans 4 YEARS DOJ BEST BUY OUT IN HISTORY
@AlderLaneeggs You are a Dem senator. We have a Dem president. A Dem Attorney General. Why can't YOU do something?
@CNBC Sounds like Hillary Clinton.
No wonder the country is messed up,we the people just sit back and let people like Strumpf, Rick Scott,Trump etc walk all over us
PUT A LEAN ON ALL HIS FINANCES UNTIL THIS IS COMPLETELY RECTIFIED!
@CNBC 
Didn't you know that all those in the top 1% are above the law?
Our own government has shown us that!
@CNBC this is the way this country operates.
You're right, Liz!! What can we do about it?
@CNBC  Corporate greed has invaded every aspect of American life condoned and assisted by the government that s/b protecting US
Because Warren Buffett, not Eliz Warren calls the shots. All a bunch of hypocrites & the public is fed up. Show us you're not BS.
: The perks of being a CEO in a financial institution. Depressing.
@CNBC ...just wrong..
@CNBC ...what then is the point of the law's existence? Thank you, @SenWarren for your tenacious dedication to justice for US.
@CNBC why is he getting anything beside handcuffs and a very long prison sentence?
@CNBC He should delete his emails.
@CNBC
Unbelievable.  Unconscionable.
- go get'em Elizabeth 
Sen Warren John Stumpf must be prosecuted under federal fraud laws,Justice Dept must pursue case Its important to set a precedent
@CNBC Must be nice to break the law and get a payday for it.
@CNBC and tell us how u are filling your pockets with lobbyists perks.
@CNBC 
They don't
Unfortunately, he'd be the second person to walk FROM THE SAME FRAUD with over $100 million.
@CNBC   Or Fake Indian Senators.....
@CNBC we can't. that is why they own congress. (with a few exceptions).
We don't, and will continue to see this kind of perversion of justice under Wall St. darling HRC, whom you endorsed, btw. Ooops.
change the law: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2783067 â€¦
We live with an insane corporate culture where CEOs do better by screwing up than by performing well. Boards are a club.
so what the fuck is he waiting for?
@CNBC what do we care what a private corp pays an outgoing CEO? Prosecute him anyway.
@CNBC that's how most criminal enterprises run
@CNBC jail!!When there held to the same penalties i encounter for driving with a damn suspended license i didnt even know about.
@CNBC are #trump and stumf long lost cousins?? Would make sense they steal from the poor and are proud of it hand holding thieves
Sen.Warren you are an extremely knowledgeable and capable force in truly representing the people of this nation. Thank you 
@CNBC or govt official, or presidential candidate
@CNBC 
Trump walks away with millions from everything. Stealing from Chairty, lust goes on.
There's something definitely wrong w/ this. CEOs who R crooks or failures don't deserve golden parachutes.
@CNBC CHARGE HIM WITH FRAUD  !!And the Employees with IDENTITY THEFT  !! Found Guilty he should not be able to leave with nothing
So is it your damn money "Warren"
We have seen that they are above our laws.
@CNBC Until CEO start paying the price for their companies misdeeds this problem will ever go away
@CNBC Same holds true for Trumps illegal activities. Rich whites get away w crimes.
@CNBC what did he know and when did he know it? Apparently a system wide problem.WF pushed tellers to produce new accounts
- Indeed. But that's your fault - you're the government - stop pretending to be a protester - that's our role, not yours.
A criminal enterprise.
This would be a great question for both cnadidates tonight. What should be done with CEO's like John Stumpf?
@CNBC When accountability to the law ends accountability to the violent mob begins. Let's not go there. We may not come back.
CEO? This is why Billy steals . Teach three children well. 30 years of greed is good.sigh
@CNBC Absolutely right Senator Warren! Not the 1st, nor the last, I'm sure.
@CNBC Outrageous! Disgusting. Handcuff time.
@CNBC 

Why would we expect Washington Politicians to obey #ruleoflaw with this...
TIP OF THE ICEBERG , THESE PEOPLE ARE THE REAL ENEMIES OF AMERICA ,AND THE WORLD .NUFF SAID .
Thats like a researcher faking data yet getting a Nobel prize for science ... w/out consequences selfish ppl will always do wrong
YES! please become a republican!
@CNBC yeah CEOs are usually such law-abiding citizens otherwiseâ€¦
@CNBC what strikes me is the fact this question has been raised for decades and Congress has done nothing.
@CNBC Probably same reason Jane Saunders received a large payout after destroying Burlington College.
@CNBC How did you become a multimillionaire? I'm sure it was through hard work & honesty. (rolling my eyes)
@CNBC What is Congress Doing about This? American Consumers are alone out There.
women you know howl?????? hard he 11 tooooooooo, you respect dat!!!!!
We need to demand more from these CRIMINALS.  What is Congress doing about it? Where's the legislation & enforcement?
#Congress is the criminal!
Really?! They aren't illegally opening bank accounts w/out your permission!
@CNBC I just assume they all break the law
did the 5,300 slave class workers get any severance?
: because in 2008 we bailed everyone out for free...that's where they got their "training". Great job Senator Warren ! Thank you.
@CNBC and you will cave once again. The do absolutely nothing congress
that's the problem in our society today. we have taken our rights too far. he should be fired and prosecuted!
@CNBC if trump wins he could become head of conumer protection agency and screw millions, and not just has bank customers.
b/c @thedemocrats are nothing more than neolibs cum neocons...you don't have insider influence
As a man of modest wants, I'd be happy do do a spot of jay walking for ten grand or so. For another ten Gs I'll drop some litter.
you're attacking his compensation without stating how much fraud % contributed to it. Asking the wrong questions senator
@CNBC So crime does pay after all.
.@SenWarren @CNBC individual criminal & civil responsibility is only answer. Corporations are NOT people my friend.
Is this the going rate for WFC execs?  Pay them $125M to leave after trashing the company and cheating customers.
@CNBC did he break the law?
.@SenWarren it's so frustrating that white collar criminals roam free with millions while we incarcerate poor people for petty theft
.@SenWarren @elizabethforma @Shelby4Senate If bank reform is your sole issue and scams keep happening YOU SHOULD RESIGN FIRST!
@AnnPettifor
I support you & your work to keep raising awareness - holding these millionaire crooks & shareholders responsible #ImWithHer
she's not. Wake up
Wide awake sir and her actions show she is working for this cause-all day, every day.
it's not enough
Let's do our part until it is enough!
he'll probably go into politics
@CNBC Sen Warren - just think what Trump is hiding in taxes, pay to play (FL & NJ), pending rape cases, Trump U, misogyny...
@CNBC yet u endorsed a cand that is backed by these ceos who doesn't want to reinstate glass steagall. #BringBernieBack
This is a powerful argument for why HR departments should be independent of the board.
It started way before Stumpf, and I don't think we do trust CEOs. @FrankChow
Sept 2008! CEOs and banks walked away with the #US Treasury !!
@CNBC  exactly !!
@CNBC  if FBI can't convict @HillaryClinton they have no right convicting anyone or punishing anyone!! @FoxNews
@CNBC @WellsFargo #lockhimup
@CNBC If WARREN BUFFET is the biggest private shareholder, isn't this biting the hand that feeds you?
@CNBC
@CNBC http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/minder-law_executive-pay-rises-despite-law-change/42045966 â€¦ still..
No one does and NOTHING has changed since 2008. Why hasn't it ?
So how did Hillary "LOSE" $ 6 BILLION during her time at the State Dept?...oh that's right...you are in HER pocket and its all ok
Citizens United et al better named Citizens Innoculated
Never think that crime doesn't pay. And BIG crime pays BIG $$
money rules everything, the unfortunate reality of how the world works
@CNBC Right EW, and if Trump gets in it's gonna be open season on the American people for sure. The wealthy are counting on it.
@CNBC 

CEOs are above the law. Except in Mr. Robot.
@CNBC you must learning a bout law in hell world
But you never demonstrated he did anything illegal. Do progressives believe in the #RuleofLaw anymore? #RegressiveLeft

@senwarren
@CNBC Stump shld walk away with a 10 year prison term. I'm sick of these criminals just walking away with all the money
@CNBC or a, God forbid, prez djt
@CNBC 
So what are YOU going to do about it?
sick
@CNBC Or politician!
How is this POSSIBLE?? Where is the DOJ?
