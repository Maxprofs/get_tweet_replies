Hold nothing back. Annihilate her. Her nomination is a slap in the face to all who've dedicated lives to improving ed 4 kids.
Yep! U nailed it as an Educator in a public school I feel the same way % agree! ur comment!
We need people who understand the hard work you do! Who understand that public schools can and do WORK.
Absolutely! I work hard each day for my kiddos would not change it!
What evidence supports this meme?
that's not evidence. Show me some proof that kids got more educated when teachers were on strike. I'll wait.
new precident is Dumpf: in the kingdom of the blind the one-eyed billionaires are kings @alexisgoldstein @usedgov
The Majority voted for President Obama twice. You seem to ignore that.
nearly 3 million more voted for HRC, yet here we are considering Devos as EdSec for Dumpf
No more people  (almost 3 million) voted for Hilary. Lowest approval EVER = Trump
but he won the electoral college and is President, get over it
We'll see what we get. To me, America has ALWAYS been great...
.@SenWarren We're counting on you, Senator. We care, and we're watching these horrible nominees.
Sadly,I suspect you've right.
They need three Republicans with a conscience.
@themanfronUNCLE @SenWarren
"Dealing with it" includes obstructing fascism with every fiber of my being.
That's how one deals with fascism.
So apparently @SenWarren believes you must have worked for the government before in order to be qualified to be successful at  @usedgov
not surprising from that relic of yesteryear and big government socialism
Ur pretty chatty lately. Pls explain y u turned ur back on Bernie n why u didn't take a stand at #NoDAPL ??
@IndivisibleMIA @usedgov Devos practically destroyed pub schools in Michigan, she is the last person who should run DeptEdu.
Such antique options.    Quit it's pass your time
isn't buying a position a violation of US law? Donating 2m to get a job, it's not right. #investigateHer
Spare a thought for UK Educators. Don't think many Edu Secretaries have much teaching experience
you are good Elizabeth Warren
well

Other than the president-elect

#Peeotus
Every last one of you need an education in civility.
Ignorant fools.
We're fighting right along with you Sen. This madness has GOT to come to an end.
@draiochta14 @usedgov Doesn't matter: Common core-gone. Teacher accountability-check. State control-check., School voucher,check.
how would you rate someone like Arne Duncan who had a wealth of experience? #youstayclassy
Even two senior, female GOP Senators say they'll vote against DeVos.
you are a tiger!  #womenleaders #powerful #democratsunite #democracy
I am an educator and we need a secretary of education that will support public education and all students. 
#DumpDeVos
if she is confirmed then what is the point of even having the hearings.  I'm so disappointed. One idiot after another
But let us put a R.O.o.M.V. person in charges of Dept. of Social Services?
All educators should feel this way & must do their homework on De Vos! Agree%
We had a POTUS for 8 years who had no leadership experience, you backed him consistently. #Hypocrite
And just look where all that "experience" has gotten us. Smh
@repmarkpocan @usedgov Is there anyone you support or are you just a sore loser?  I've watched Cspan hearings. You are nasty!
so much for crony capitalism, right @realDonaldTrump?
@zbleumoon @usedgov stop the madness ... don't confirm his nominees... Palin clones.
Agree 100%!!! Thanks Ann Louisa 
Betsy DeVos will be the decline of our public school system. She has lobbied for privatization of our schools for years.
Betsy #DeVos's lack of experience speaks for itself: http://ow.ly/omiI3080kaz  @SenWarren @usedgov #DumpDeVos #DeVosHearing #Questions4Betsy
Betsy doesn't even have an advanced degree. Disgraceful nomination!
We should abolish the @usedgov  and that should be Betsy DeVos' mission.  #NoValueAdded #StatesRights
find something not 150 years ago.  All the living racists are on your side.
lmao afterr working in a Detroit school, I'll take an outsider any day!  Welcome Betsy!
Those who disrespect public education will have a bad future. You've earned it.
That's why we PAY 4 charter education 4 r kids, we went through public education; experience gave us knowledge
Charter schools are scams.
Not all, I've seen excellent charter schools, parents need to be involved
Your anecdotal evidence does not override the norm.
Lizawatha's on another planet, Fred. I just don't know which one...
We don't need a Sunday School lesson plan, Betsy, we don't need vouchers. We need education for ALL, equally.
please do not vote for her. Keep fighting on behalf of our children.
agree. Pls keep fighting.
@MonsterMarcia @babsiemay #FBI #IRS #Veterans #Law Chaos & Distractions = Profit OVER People https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJquRp5__oY â€¦
thank you for your merciless grilling of this dangerously unqualified nominee.
There is no precedent for a #POTUS with the lack of experience in politics/leadership that @realDonaldTrump has.
what life experience do you have? You've been a political hack forever.
not to mention a DOE nomination who knows not what the department does! Nuclear physicist to a general BA/BS degree. Smh
My President Trump will be investigating Jill Stein and her new found wealth....@realDonaldTrump
have you pocahontas any exp b4 running and sitting 1st time as senator?
e warren is a fraud & a liar. What has she done for America during her time in office? It's time to drain the swamp.
sure is a precedent for someone who lied about their ethnicity to got a Harvard gig becoming a senator tho. Isn't there?
after electing Obama twice there is no such thing as anyone being unqualified for any office.
Much respect for you! You were direct and fierce
With a failing educ system +pple like me miss teaching we've lost thousands of teachers + students. Now this?! Very Sad.
anyone opposing DeVos is in opposition to students and is fighting for teachers unions. Not a BAD thing, but be honest.
Precedent: @SenWarren blocked the release of HER school records to prevent the public from seeing her lies regarding her ethnicity 
@usedgov
@JOHNGIDDING @usedgov Elizabeth. On this we totally agree.
don't confirm her.
Kinda like you being an "Indian?" @SenWarren @usedgov
From the woman who lied about her heritage to get a job teaching one class for $400 grand at Harvard.
Trump picked her...that's good enough for us
But by all means show her no civility whatsoever.
@MichPolticsEd @usedgov Sadly, Mrs. DeVos lacks any experience other than spending money. She is not a business woman or leader.
Please block her! I have 6 grandkids in public school.
Let's get someone with experience since it has been working so well. Abolish the DOE. Get the Feds out of education!
Thank u for getting all of your questions and concerns on the record.This is more than policy difference-it's complete ignorance of the job.
shut up & quit whining. Your BFF lost to a guy that has no business being president.  What does that say about Hillary?
Block her!  #neverbetsy
There's also no precedent for being a bitch and failing to acknowledge the nominee with a simple handshake.
You did a fantastic job interviewing those Brainless candidates. God help our children if DeVos gets confirmed. 
There's no precedent for one that stole others affirmative action placements by lying about their heritage being elected Senator
Absolutely agree.
, aren't you tried of saying that basic idea by now? I mean, it's gotta be seriously exhausting.
https://goo.gl/YzFrA5  via @yidwithlid @SenWarren u owe @BetsyDeVos an #apology 4 ur #classlessbehavior #UNAcceptable 4 any "Senator"
The PARCC test to pass third grade in Chicago takes more than 3 hours. Another hearing @SenAlexander
So the Indian princess who has disgraced herself won't even shake hands with presidential nominee! Great example!!!!
and there isn't a requirement for there to be one you sub-genius
Well the experts have done such a FABULOUS job, you know. @SenWarren @usedgov
DeVos's school choice program in DC is strongly supported by the low-income families it serves:
and not only her. the future terrifies me. I fear damage will be done that I will not live to see fixed in my lifetime.
@Tony_Zardoz @usedgov Is there even a MARKET for used govt secretaries?
Wow.  One of the most embrassing things I have seen.  Betsy should have said she was an Indian like you.
Vote No
Please tell me that the GOP has more sense than to confirm DeVos!!
Congress cannot let DeVos be in DC. My retired wife, former teacher could do better than her...and would cost less.
There is no excuse for Trump either, unfortunately we get 4 years of him.
@jerhende @usedgov boo yah
Poor #Pochahantas. Didn't get her way.
I am a democrat but am embarrassed by your rude, disrespectful and condescending attitude at hearing , show some respect
It took me about seven readings to not see that as "used gov."
Already?
didn't you refuse to release your law school records to hide the fact you lied about being a native American?
same could be said for Pres Obama's executive experience before he became potus.  You seem to think he did fine.
The ones WITH experience have brought standards down.
at least she didn't lie about being a native American for her own benefit fauxcahantis.
your shrill voice is worse than fingernails on a chalkboard. 
@usedgov
I SAID THAT WHEN YOU RAN YOU KNOW NOTHING YOUR STYLE IS EMBARRASSING I AM A CHOCTAW YOU HAVE A TRUST ISSUE WITH PEOPLE
how's what we have been working senator! Why not change! What's wrong with you! Time for you to open your eyes!
Why do you treat people like idiots?
She wants to only support christian schools & charter schools. Many charter schools are religious.
I live in her city & she has been trying to take funding from public shools to give to charter schools.
so $400,000 to teach one class is the experience you recommend? That is the reason for default student loans #URAfraud
PLEASE VOTE AGAINST SCOTT PRUITT!Oklahomans are horrified that he would head EPA. Oklahoma is shaking to the ground.
Hey Lizzy, you are very nasty witch. Can't even be considerate of Mrs. Devos and shake her hand like the rest.Witch
So "freedom of choice" is ok when it comes to the fetus, but not about freedom of choice when it comes to educating those fetuses
With all due disrespect only 2 of the 11 Secretaries of @usedgov worked in public schools. Get off your high horse.
This is wrong. 4/ 11 F/T, Other served in other capacities or taught college.
1924 picture of democrats marching at democrat national convention.  Is this true?
you have no class. Then again, you're a millionaire socialist.
Thank you for forcing these people to own up to their ignorance! You are a force to be reckoned with...EW=WonderWoman 
@DmDennishga @usedgov Maybe that's why the education system is in such bad shape and we're like 33rd in the world in education?
what is the precedent 4 dems 2 act like petulant children?U lost. #HRC is corrupt & #Horrible. Bad choice. #GrowUP DEAL!
Was their precedent for fake Indians at Harvard?
it's horrible.
what is the precedent 4 a Senator 2 act like a #classless human being not capable of showing simple respect 2 another?
She wants to gut U.S. education while her company makes millions on charter schools.
what a disaster for education she would be!
- she should not be appointed. Severely under qualified!
I've nvr understood taking a teacher's views on a subject over a do'ers..
4% of 8th grade kids in Detriot R reading/math at an 8th grade level.  What? She gonna take it down to 3%.
thank you Sen, Warren, for keeping DeVos's feet to the fire, where are her ethics forms? why cheating on taxes in Mi.
Pound sand Lie-A-Watha
You are the epitome of classlessness.
There is no precedent for a US Sen with the lack of professionalism in public service that @SenWarren has.

@usedgov
@suejohnston56 @usedgov She wouldn't even qualify to be an entry-level public school teacher!
You showed how classless you are by not shaking that Mrs. Devos' hand. Such foul "leadership"
Well...she could always lie, and cheat like you do,
"experience" makes the difference?Our education system sucks.Billions of $ wasted.Time for a change.Bye unions.Charters!
Show us your college records Senator.  What have you got to hide?  @usedgov
what a classless child Warren is. Stop your whining and get to work. And shake hands with the nominee. Looser.
Where has experience gotten us so far?  Time for a determined novice to take the reigns.@usedgov
Liawatha Warren had to go through life facing the derision claiming  Native rights & affirmative action brings to a liar
you are another useless millionaire who has helped the Democrats screw over the middle class. Good job you, you lump!
here is what I found of one of our progressive leaders.

why don't your repub senate colleagues understand this? @usedgov
:DeVos+Billionaires$ used MI as test ground=failure MI PubSchools now plight of avg Am's in MI+pirvitizedSch=0 acc'ty
It seems you are confused about Ms. DeVos because she is willing to work for $1 per year and wants good edu. for all.
please ban Senators together. Ensure she is not confirmed. Our children deserve better. How is she even a consideration?
This is an unhinged girl! So much hatred in her! @usedgov
Considering the mess our education system is in perhaps we need someone with a new approach! U had your chance!
Says the women who bragged about being an Indian and wasn't.
arenâ€™t you the same elizabeth warren who charges $400,000 for one course?
No excuse for someone so unqualified
@katherinefugate we are in big trouble
what about every other trump nominee?
@MaureenRoble @usedgov It's harder to become a substitute teacher.
@BoobsRadley @usedgov I can't wait for charter schools 
@BoobsRadley public schools did such a good job that all the children grew up and voted for Trump. And you want more of same?
@lakeshow73 @usedgov Who said time travel was impossible-Trump&Co are ready to take us back to the 60's!
@BoobsRadley @usedgov is there a precedent for wasting taxpayer money and donations for a recount since dems can't handle losing?
@argillic @usedgov the bears tho. http://onehotmessalaska.blogspot.com/2017/01/open-letter-to-grizzly-bear-trying-to.html â€¦
read: major labor union expects me to try to kill this nomination
Wow same can be said 4 certain Senator who lied about ethnicity & got special treatment from Harvard #LiberalHypocrisy
unpresidented
since you've decided public experience is necessary to be govt official, explain your position as senator.
PresidentO lacked  experience of being a chief executive,failed us all,divided us, opened borders w crime/drugs #MAGA
You had no experience when freshman senator & sat on one of the most important chairs in Congress. #Hypocrite
So, is this kinda a "smoke signal" confirming you don't have the votes to stop it,.#pocahontas
Yah, and look what results we got from having "experienced" public education folks in there before-lousy and non-competitive in todays world
Such a same you all could not ask all you wanted.  Good Ol boys network at work.
You had no experience as an Indian either but wrote a cookbook.
Lack of knowledge re: IDEA alone is grounds to disqualify. Access to education denied at state/local level can't stand.
Simmer down injun ..Lol..How's Hillary doing.
called my representatives and voiced my opposition to her nomination as well as Jeff Sessions and Rex Tillerson
Like a senator who blocked release of her own law school records because she lied about her ethnicity?
#noDeVos
why did you block release of your records? Could it be that you LIED?
let's talk about your nationality .... Unlock you records, LIAR
She is not in education to make sure our kids get rich with knowledge, but to make herself rich from education.
You are just the bitter old lady that hates kids playing in your yard. Dem's had their chance and failed.  Go away!
I'm starting to become convinced that there's an invisible "no experience necessary" sign hanging from the White House.
Watching @SenWarren question HHS  nominee reminds me how dishonest she is
you are wrong too many times.   And you are rude.  Are you leading an unhappy life? She has more qualifications than you
There is no precedent for someone as deluded as you being elected Senator either
you couldn't have the common courtesy to shake her hand! How senatorial! No wonder the democrats lost and have been
so much stupid here. Do any of you people live on earth, watch real news or read stats? #libtards
only a wall streeter would have the kind of bank / loan management experience you seek.....
I just dropped out of my PhD program in special ed yet I'm still more qualified to lead the department than her
agreed. Use all your resources to stop this appointment in its tracks.
there's also no precedent for the lack of experience our upcoming president has or for his Russian connection
