Brown Mackie College does the same thing.
when you indoctrinate children with perpetual white guilt dogma you are "cheating" students #altrightrising
since you asked me, I will ask you, why are you prejudiced against blacks and others?
-I'm not.The empirical and forensic evidence unequivocably shows that multiracial societies are inherently
What about the students like me that have already been hosed for the full amount
students are making a choice to invest in their futures consciously. Buyers remorse is not the school's fault.
Now what about the families that are hurting from this shady school? Struggling to make ends meet.
Hi Sandra. Are you by chance a former employee of ITT Tech?
No My husband went to the school and has over 100K debt from the place.
He went to the Arnold MO location.

julie take your craziness back to Fox News hun.
, you also put a lot of @ITTTech educators out of a job. Brilliant foresight, acting so hastily in your personal vendetta.
You could've had mandate in place for other schools to accept @ITTTech credits. You didn't help those students at all.
, my wife had 1 quarter for nursing degree at @ITTTech. Now what about her? What's she to do now? All that time wasted.
not smart enough to see down the road for current students of @ITTTech. She had a personal vendetta, was all.
what about students about to grad @ITTTech ? You really screwed them. You wasted their time & taxpayer dollars.
Good job losing Dem Prez election. @ITTTech students won't vote for you or Dems now. Brilliant.
about time! Never attended but I have friends in debt thanks to @ITTTech.

Half of your State's colleges under perform compared to ITT. What are you doing about them?
this a step towards sensibility.the more I find out about us govt and student loan structures, I want to cry

Like YOU cheated HARVARD by saying you were Indian and bullied them into a cushy 400K salary
Good job!  More than 8,000 out of work and triple that students who are unable to finish with no recourse. #FuckNut
They took me for nearly $20,000 in 2006 by rolling over loans without other options for Financial Aide. Still under it
Mrs Liz Should DOE directors and chiefs to be fired asap for negligence and failing to monitor?
@WSJ  AIG other WS banks cheated taxpayers billions of dollars, Fed bailed them out. All politicians are same Righteous.
if you invalidate the school, do you invalidate the degrees?  But previous students still have to pay... Doesn't help
Elizabeth go get Trump and show him what real policy is....
as an instructor there I was never trying to cheat my students just trying to help them.
Good so sick of theme scamming people out of thousand$ For a unaccredited degree 
Which is not transferable. Such a scam
how's that different than what elected politicians like yourself do with my tax $$$ be glad when ur free ride is done
but you do it everyday dear still have that mole
Thank you Liz, I am hoping Hillary wins to make community college free for my daughter, she graduates  HS in 2 years
Be sure to remind people who was for the taxpayer funding of private colleges that rip students off! #Election2016
ruined my life. $62000+ in debt at 20% interest and no credits or degree to show for it. They win while I struggle
what do you think of Trumps latest racist tweet?
what happened to lizzie she got lock jaw I don't hear her running her mouth about trump!!!!!better she don't!VOTE TRUMP!
I have no idea where they get these polls but not one time have o been ask. So no no I ido not believe in polls
Stein is no spoiler. If you Endorsed Bernie instead of a Warmonger Queen there would not be a demand for Jill. #JillNotHill

I'm going to enjoy watching you take a MACHETE to RED TAPE for the next 8+ years
UOP should be next!
thank you miss warren.
How about the one that Bill & Hillary made millions off of?
Now if only the Clinton Foundation, Al Sharpton and the rest of the "Do as I say" Dems would stop cheating on taxes.
I was a victim of University of Phoenix a few years ago. Glad others being caught up to also.
What does this mean for former students stuck with ITT loan debt?
But it's OK for you to make $400K as a minority?
"minority"
and it only took 30 years. No wonder you never get anything accomplished.
Death to charter schools!
You want to know who rules over you? Look to who you're not allowed to criticize, ergo, Warren is Hillary's property
here is @HillaryClinton s pickle Check out @RealJasonPappas's Tweet:
here is @HillaryClinton s pickle and my kids don't want it.  https://youtu.be/zWIKNAL6EIs  
Massive defaults & keeping predatory schools open is much worse than using taxpayer $ to fix a wrong & give justice
Don't forget the for profit school that paid @billclinton $17 million you hack!!
It's official the Dems want a MONOPOLY on cheating the tax payers.
Yeah, cheating ppl out of $ is government's job! They don't like it when folks cut in on their action!!
how about going after public schools that take more government funding then for profit.
what about community college that produce poor results than for profit school
Thanks for putting me out of work! Hopefully I can bounce back. What programs help out with that?
You are advocate of @HillaryClinton who sold public positions for cash
it's past time!  Please, let's end predatory lending of all types!
Let's just stop government tuition loans for students at the for-profit schools.
now if we can just get DTJ's supporters to see they are being fleeced as if they were TrumpU students.
.@SenWarren @ITTTech @CNN Would guess Clintons school is next, taking $millions as salary to do nothing?
why, did they not except 1/32nd native Americans for there diversity classes.
Then go after the drug companies. Can't afford to pay for healthcare that I am required to have bc of obamacare
I started to enroll years ago-thank God I didn't!
Good!!!
Coleman College should be next. They owe me a few bucks
Why support shady, cheating politicians then?
#ShutItDown
Do something about the #ArtInstitues and then we'll talk.
I have seen hundreds of students change their lives here! How dare you. There are real lives being affected negatively by this.
Her Alma Mater
is there an article I can read more about this? My kid when there.
We'll only support Ivy League schools who hire fake minority professors......
it's about damn time
FU Warren!
Trump U is Next!
This from the woman who lies about her ancestors.
Was tlkd n2 student loan (diff  school) when I could've  $in full. Impacted current ed xpns 2 6fig debt #predatory 
?recourse
Did some of the teachers unfairly claim minority status in order to raise tuition through higher pay? @SenWarren @ITTTech
ITT fills more jobs in electronics and info security than any other school. Bill Clinton made $17mm from a for profit??
Shame on Congress for not acting sooner in the students' and taxypayers' best interest.  Thank you, Elizabeth, for the tweet.
Shirley Chisholm would be proud of Jill Stein. Green Party is the party of the smart future!
they took a lot of money from my nephew. I'm glad I didn't send my son there.
#ITTTech Thank you senator Warren.
There are many for-profit Tech Schools ripping off students. It's time to stop them & force them to reimburse students.

How about this is reason we are in this fix? http://hotair.com/archives/2015/02/05/obamas-student-loan-program-22-billion-in-the-hole-for-fy2015/ …
@SenWarren @ITTTech
The american people should wake up. Obama in 2010 put us in this fix with all tuition when he took over student loans.
POTUS "took over student loans"? Are you nuts? @SenWarren
They did. And they lowered standards for who got them and what could spend on.
At that time schools saw a free ride and increased tuition. And people who shouldn’t get used money for wrong things.
from 2015. we are now paying for it.
They need to this with many more schools, maybe all of them.
And Trump "U".   Don't all adults know the proper use of the term university?
as an alum, I never felt cheated. Been told by bosses that's why I was hired. BTW, under investigation is not convicted
amen!  Can't wait for justice from EDMC/Art Institutes. For-profit school must pay
yet you endorsed Clintons who took 17mil in 2015 from for profit colleges
maybe Bill Clinton can give back the $15m of money he got from students at for profit scam Laurette
and what about your FREE ride?
dared to raise your head up today, huh?
Time to tease you know who!
were students forced to attend? They had choices right? Free market means something?
@LaureateIntlU still going strong, though.
@HillaryClinton #youTwoCheated #TheAmericanCitizenry #BlueIsTheNewRed #DemWarMongers #DemCheaters #DemocratsShitOnVoters
in other words, they've outlived their usefulness to you.
How about shady politicians like you!
say goodbye to charter schools. They are a poison to our future and society
I would look at Berklee College of Music right in your own backyard. Post-grad employment figures includes waitressing jobs.
Well, better late than never I guess! Especially for a make -believe Native to call out FRAUD!
thank you for standing up to these crooked! You are the kind of person who truly makes America great, everyday.
@SenWarren @ITTTech
these 4 profit colleges&schools r supported by congress with huge cash donations and govt backed loans.congress loves it
As long as we can still blame Republicans for it, you mean? #StillSanders
Does it feel good to know everyone thinks you're a hillary shill? And that you sold out because you wanted vp ohhh so bad?
But you were happy to "stand by" as the shady DNC cheated voters & taxpayers in the Primary. #Hypocrite #Fraud
....Like Trump University????? @realDonaldTrump Hopefully, this is a harbinger of things to come.
but yes I can say I am a native American
I agree, and we should look at the other public and private universities that have students obtaining worthless degrees!
I hope ITTTECH will be forced to refund or pay the balance of the student loans
you gonna let her take you down like that, @ITTTech?
cus the bright schools are not cheating their students...
bout time...they been fooling people for years n years!!!
GOOD!
@HillaryClinton @MarlonDMarshall People call Hillary a bitch.
