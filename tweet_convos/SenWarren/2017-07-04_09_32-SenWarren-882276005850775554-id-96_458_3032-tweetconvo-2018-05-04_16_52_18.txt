Thank you for your service. We wouldn't be where we are today without your dedication and perseverance! Happy 4th!
Just keep your troops at home.
Great. Do us all a favor and voice support 4 @RepBarbaraLee ammendment to repeal GWOT AUMF and force vote on new more narrowly scoped one
Meanwhile General Bone Spurs honored the military by going golfing again for the 36th time- taxpayer $ isn't going to embezzle itself.
Keep crying online, only 7 more years of tears.
Good
Tell McCain to take it easy with tough talk to N. Korea.  Some of us have years to go (in the double digits) unlike ...well you know.
What have you done for our troops over the past eight years? Nothing!
Using our troops as props is pretty incredible. What happened to pulling our troops out of Afghanistan?
I would love to know when u Dems r going to stop ur lies about Mr Trump and start doing your jobs
I want to thank you & the other Senators for visiting our troops. Our President should have done that.
Thank you for representing our country in a dignified and honorable manner! 
Warren for POTUS
Her campaign slogan could be: 'I'm with Pocahontas'
Ahhh.  The low intelligence level of an Elizabeth Warren supporter revealed itself rather early this time.  #highcheekbones
Thank u to all of our elected leaders 4 going to Afghanistan to spend time with soldiers with little fanfare! So great
You go shyann
thanks for being present & Presidential! We need a leader, who isn't too busy golfing, gossiping & stirring controversy
BTW HAPPY 4th
Yeah... I agree. Good thing Trump is in there and was doing stuff before he was even in there. Obama and his constant golfing was ridiculous
Figures fellow RINO's & @POTUS haters  @SenJohnMcCain  @LindseyGrahamSC would align themselves w/ Warren. I wonder if they burned any flags?
Coming from you is laughable
We owe them our gratitude
What lies did you tell them about yourself?
You and Mac should be running this country and notwhats his name
Our military is incredible even when they reduce their benefits, give them Third World Healthcare and refuse them the same rights as illegal
Wow that looks like Democrat @SenJohnMcCain  weres the other three
Thank you Senator Warren.
Hardly the inspirational civilian leadership I'd look to if I was still in the service.
Great series of photos you shared with us. Thank you all for spending the holiday with out troops.
There would be more prospect of peace in this world if the US did not deploy its troops everywhere & just stopped interfering.
God bless our troops, and the people in our communities who protect us, teach us, doctor us, and make our lives better every day.
Why are you there? I know you don't believe in war?
What a Hypocrite.
I adore you
Glad to see you with @SenJohnMcCain !  2 strong patriotic minds working together across party lines --- more please!!
OMG is that actually Democrats and Republicans cooperating in the same pic? MORE OF THIS PLEASE.

For those wishing for a genuinely sincere, heartfelt #FourthofJuly  from a REAL #POTUS
... Here you go 

â€¦
uR nOthIng bUt aN OpPoRTunIsT-  sAd!
Why are we still there? Didnt we achieve our objectives with killing OBL?  This is a waste of money and terrible strategy @DeptofDefense
Very nice.
How many times have you gone and paid respects to the plane loads of caskets coming home? Typical politician on photo op using the troops
Do you support the improvements @POTUS has implemented for our Vets?
I'd like to participate in @SenWarren 's next promotion ceremony!   

Nice to see you all standing together
Going to take time for you to re-earn mmy trust. Keep working on that. Stand up to Trump in order to protect our Troops every where..
If Elisabeth Warren really cares about military. Find out why dems let the people die in Benghazi and then lied about it.
Start congress investigation into the over 560 POW's left behind in Viet Nam.
Perfect picture of future globalist government all traders . Warren, Graham, McCain, Globalist democrats and traders
Traders do love globalization. It's how trade works. It's also how places that get snow in the winter still get fresh fruit. And Coffee.
That picture best describes #TermLimits
if you give a hoot about our  #troops,  keep them home.
Don't let them fight for nothing.
It's that Senator Graham? I lov him!
Remember that when he takes away your healthcare.
@MuharremErkek17 @KremlinRussia_E @EUDelegationTur I think not religion persons are'nt terrorist :) WHO is have these ideas?
Funny a "libtard" is out with the troops while @realDonaldTrump is golfing yet again
A bi-partisan participation,  no less!
Bipartisan with McCain?? Ask McCain about the over 560 POW's left behind in Viet Nam. Ask them to investigate it. Believe me they won't
Thanks to the men & woman who protect r democracy Keep wrking 4 US Sen Warren Ignore  the bots we appreciate yr service & wrk
Lizzy you have never supported our military and our troops! You must be running for reelection already!

At least you care now... I guess? 
#berniewouldawon #bernie2020 @justicedems
Thank you @SenWarren  #Happy4thofJuly
There families should have been able to participate.  Not you!
You would send their families in a war zone?  That's very loving of you.  Smh!
Not playing golf ?
Yo, Liz. How about we undeploy them. Ultimate reward for dying needlessly: Bring. Then. Home. Then celebrate. #IndependenceDay
Them* eff you, Twitter. Edit option. Seriously. 
McCain is a disgrace and should retire.  It should be rmemebered how he acted during those hearings a few weeks back.  Use the 25th on him
And 45 is golfing!
Thank you for visiting them and thank them for their service! 
#ClassAct #SupoortOurTroops Thank you to all!
Always easy to voice our support. May we SHOW it more often and DO more to avoid conflict putting them in harm's way.
All I see is an #establishment government photo
When we close our eyes we see what we want.
^ Meaningless rhetoric. Come at me with a REAL argument one day.
I don't argue. Arguments are just projections of our own insecurities as attacks by others.
You and your plunger seemed really enlightened. Try to have a nice day.
America has always been great.

yeah ok
You make me proud!
