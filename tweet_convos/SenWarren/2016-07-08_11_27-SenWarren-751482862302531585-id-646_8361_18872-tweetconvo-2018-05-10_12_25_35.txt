@Gabbiedrice78K We need Elizabeth Warren on the Democratic ticket as VP.She would call out Trump, & bring Bernie supporters along
I just think if #Sanders supporters are willing to vote for a racist, fascist, xenophobe, they can #FuckOff.
You have such charming language. I'm sure Bernie would be proud and impressed!
Why would I ever want to impress #Sanders?Unlike his supporters I'm loyal to #DemBrand to say what I think of him
If loyal to #DemBrand you're a failure as an American. 
Vote for policies, not teams #FeelTheBern
@PlowPlot
Hahahaha! Can't handle the truth? Clinton is a loser. #FeelTheBern #NewHillaryConspiracyTheories
.@PlowPlot @Gabbiedrice78K 

Can't handle the fact Bernie Sanders is dropping out and endorsing @HillaryClinton?
You can blame Obama for all this mess. Which is normal for him.
educate yourself Lizzie! It wasn't a routine traffic stop!
blks also shouldn't shoot other blks bc they are from a different neighborhood.  Cough cough let's talk about Chicago
put on a uniform and walk the streets, then speak about it.The policies the democrats have put on police have caused this mess!
Yes, and @BlackLivesMatter shouldn't be calling for the killing of police officers.
and you shouldn't have betrayed the voters but it's a shitty world and you're backing someone who made it that way. #neverhillary
If a police officer's life is threatened he/she should defend himself/herself despite the circumstance.
but if a police officer threatens a civilian's life, what's the correct response
Carefully follows the orders of the police officer. Most certainly do not resist.
Hey @turfpunter this man carefully followed orders of a police officer & did not resist. Got shot anyway. 
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/21/florida-police-shoot-black-man-lying-down-with-arms-in-air …
.@turfpunter When he asked the officer why he shot him, the officer said "I don't know"
I watched the video and read the shooting victim's story. The video does not show shooting. Why the rush to judgement?
@NotFlashGordon then maybe they should be stealing shit concealing a weapon while under investigation.
- And blacks should not be killing 3000 in Detroit.  Where's the outrage?  Where is the black lives matter crowd?  Wy only Cops?
White & Black people need to show RESPECT 4 the Law. They think they can argue their way out of a ticket when caught.
ROFL!!I'm waiting for her to announce a relative that have features of blacks, or Muslims.I'm sure it's coming!USER
@amyschumer she rock
@SenWarren
I agree.  DT can't be President either for what he does to women.  Look into this Jill Harth story please.  She needs an apology
They shouldn't be killed over crack, heroin, meth, sneakers, cars,lack of education home environment... thank you Progressives
most people agree, but it is really class ware fare and political issues in play. Officers are not paid to think, just act....
Really stepping out on a limb there, Senator.
Think her crotch hurts from straddling the fence.
honestly. it's like, pick a side already
They are against cops, blm side picked..
How about addressing the whites killed by cops too? Many times more. Or the black on black violence. Or blk on white violence?
White women shouldn't claim native heritage to get a leg up and You should come clean. Louis Gates can confirm for you. TRY IT!!!
Please give one example of a black life lost to police that was "routine"? #clueless #blackpanderer
neither should anyone not just blacks. You need to represent all Americans
Hello Chief Obvious
see that's why your in charge you're paid alot of money to state the obvious.
https://youtu.be/fafHPuHO4A8 
What about Chicago? Dems don't want to discuss the carnage in Obama's old stomping grounds.
Not Rocket science - if police will police themselves & report officers who have racial issues it ends #NotGonnaHappen
if your truly sick why aren't you doing something?
more whites have been killed by police than blacks have . its a fact. So stop posting false propaganda
@sophiiejoones 
Well said..
ROUTINE Traffic stop? I'm gonna guess You've never had to conduct a traffic stop... Just a guess.
you'll never know what it's like to be a real minority !!! STHU!!
the only thing you've ever said in your entire life I agree with
Everyone should not resist police during routine traffic stops.
Shouldn't that apply to all Americans?  ahh the politics of division used by democrats wanting votes.  Shame on you racist.
probably the one thing we angry on. Still a trump supporter! #trumpence16
Did Y talk to Obama & H. about Chicago  2,395+ murders this year blk/blk crime no.1 in the us.What are y going to do?
So true
Please read the Harvard professors report on police shootings. Whites & Latinos are 12 times more likely to be shot by police.
yet here we go again? And what is Obama doing about it? #BatonRougePD
that traffic stop was proven to not be "routine" so shut your race baiting trap with your racist narrative
Change Police training and up the levels of who can join the police! Rather than gun toting ex military who r a bunch of pussies!
you left out one important word and added a word that makesyour post racist  INNOCENT AMERICANS shouldn't be killed.
again the prog makes the two morally equivalent
There is no such thing as a "routine" traffic stop.  Goes to show what you know about law enforcement!
It was not a routine traffic stop.  Why don't you hush your big mouth until the investigation is over.  You love to incite!!
And officers who shoot people should go through the justice system...Not you or Black lives matter.
killer cops need to be prosecuted immediately for murder etc with swift and sure justice.
@SenWarren
no American should be killed. Stop making this racial please
that's the problem...fear and racism IS "taught"!
U don't even know the facts. The cop was not at fault Race Baiter.
If blacks didnt resist arrest they wouldnt chose their faith to die. The criminals are just to stupid. Only Hillary is above law.
Despite cameras, we weren't there and the officers may not have done any such thing.  Wait til the investigation first.
God forbid you wait for the evidence. Isn't that how our justice system works??? You ARE the problem!!!!!
what????
You think black people are getting shot because they resist arrest? Did they just defrost you?
guns kill. Start at the beginning. Hate armed with a rock is survivable.
@334_1761  Perhaps if only the NRA didn't encourage 300M Americans to have guns the police wouldn't be afraid at a traffic stop.
change it to "blacks shouldn't pull guns on police".
Racebaiting democrat party-I've been dem since Kennedy-Switch after continuous racist calls from dems to everyone that disagrees
@Heather79Rogers OK captain obvious
@iamrashidajones so no killing BLACKS, whites totally cool. Check. Got it.
This problem will not be solved by the level of thinking that created it.  (Paraphrase of Einstein.)
we need Trump for 2017
the two are not mutually exclusive. They may be linked. The more the police are viewed as a calm force for good, the safer we are
ya think ?
Profound insight.
; Really,  you think. Warren a highschool Senator. Yikes, a political hack, zero solutions, just talk. Embarrassing ---
@KimGrahamCSA *any Americans, not just black
and you shouldn't have backed Hillary. You are backing everything you claim to be against and as a long time fan it makes me sad
duh,ya think?
you are absolutely correct. What can we do to change what's going on in USA?
- It didn't have to come to this. If we had listened to Sanders! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXoI11T8JDA …
@amyschumer  Looks like Captain Obvious, has struck again.
Way to stay neutral.
@amyschumer #cunt
Vote Repugs out on rail!Then can create proper gun control laws!Stop them from sleeping with NRA &Corps &Rich 4changes!
And get PAID by THEIR tax dollars; like like paying them 2 KILL them.
when people are confronted by the police do what they say
Not all Black Americans are bad/criminals just like not all Police are bad/abuse their authority.
This is a good start Pam
>He claimed he looked like 1 they were looking 4. Looking at pictures, that seems patently false.
a monster is devouring ur neighbors 1 by 1 over generations how many more & how long before all strike back collectively
Hadn't the attack on police happened Anglo majority wouldn't be talking about the latest Afri-Americans murdered by cops
However, cause and effect all things are relative generations of one finally brought on one occurrence of the other.
OMG YOU'RE SUCH AN F'ING GENIUS! You should be running a think tank for the obvious.

, those traffic stops are only routine if you're black.
and politicians shouldn't jump to conclusions, how about waiting for the damn facts before doing your rain dance Fauxcahantas !
Thank you. No one should be using excessive force on anyone! Shame on anyone who uses a gun to kill innocent people.
(1) Amen on both counts. (2) Please run for Vice-President. (3) Please?
how many white guys have been killed at traffic stops?
ya think? Wow - thanks for weighing in dummy.
easier said than done with such easy access to guns.
@AbeyAdams u r example of problem convincing the easily led of falsehood. Man shot wasn't innocent & neither r u. Shame on u
.@SenWarren you need to pick a side! There's no room for logic in politics!
Black Americans instead of physically attacking police should follow police instructions and they won't be shot. Easy peasy!
#HeAintHeavyHesMyBrother #AllLivesMatter #BlackLivesMatter #PoliceLivesMatter #CommonSenseGunLawsForUsAll
we all know that.. How about making a statement to everyone plotting to kill police officers..
WTH are babbling about? Officer pulled Castile over because he met desc. of armed robbery suspect. Hardly routine. #Payattention
#SundayMorning, @SenWarren☭« @iamrashidajones☭« If I did NOTHING WRONG, I'd rather take cop 2 court than invite cop 2 MY FUNERAL. OBEY LAWS.
.@SenWarren see I can put out non sequitors with implied, self serving, dispersion on institutions and people.
.@SenWarren politicians shouldn't inflame an already tense situation & people shouldn't believe politicians put other's first
so white Americans should?
.@SenWarren Incredible viewpoint there, Senator. Wow. Shines a whole new light on things. Very introspective.
Routine traffic stop? The man was an armed criminal !!  Do you read ??
Sadly, Trump would only agree with half of your statement.
No shit Liz
except it DOES happen. Start coming up with solutions and not statements that were all know to be true.
and you shouldn't have waited for @HillaryClinton to pull ahead of @SenSanders before you jumped on to the winning team.

Please stop exploiting these tragedies for your political benefit.
true and Liberal activists should not go on @CNN @AC360 @donlemon and say police hunt young Black men for sport
the statistics do not correlate with the inflammatory rhetoric
guess you missed a 911 call was made about #AltonSterling pointing a gun
@amyschumer wow, so profound. What a bold statement. How about passing legislation to actually do something.
How Police Forces Can Rebuild Public Trust and Safer Communities Sustainably http://goo.gl/KtFYQ0 
false equivalence. Police/firefighters/soldiers may die in line of duty. Part of job description. Not true for civilians
... and gays shouldn't be killed while enjoying a night out with friends.
also brown people shouldnt be killed with drones and American invasion, but I know you disagree being a @HillaryClinton supporter

@Niplahr why don't just say Americans?  Keep dividing!
Please be Vice-President, then President.
and American's retirement dreams shouldn't be killed by your DOL rulings!
@amyschumer water is wet
@SenWarren
And u shouldn't have allowed yourself to be bought by the Clintons. So, what's your solution?
Truer words are rarely spoken.  Thank you for your voice of reason.
deep thinking Liz, real deep. Smh!
your opinion isnt important. Go back to your office & do some work Warren
Stunning that 15,800 people liked this pandering, say nothing, crap. No wonder these awful people win elections.
@_erock
#IMAGINE ♡♡♡
@amyschumer the only statement Sen. Warren has made  that makes sense...
so right,
@amyschumer You have a marvelous grasp of the obvious, @SenWarren ...
And White people should not pretend to be Native American to get the benefits. http://directory.libsyn.com/episode/index/id/4487856 … #LIAR #Trump2016
@amyschumer and you shouldn't wear shorts in a blizzard! WTF do u even mean idiot
if our progressive politicians stop bowing down to the establishment, maybe we could get actually something meaningful done!
No such thing as a "routine traffic stop".
&tell me how great Clinton is when her people just refused 2support seniors living in poverty? sad  #DemPlatform
@iamrashidajones was it a routine traffic stop? No! State the facts! Media causing deaths by stating one sided stories.
@amyschumer that's profound!Where's your solution #DallasPoliceShootings
"Black Americans shouldn't be killed in routine traffic stops" Prove this flat out lie! @SenWarren
African Americans shouldn't be killed at ANY traffic stops.
why you pushing division by pushing false narratives ?
https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2016/07/08/confirmed-philando-castile-was-an-armed-robbery-suspect-false-media-narrative-now-driving-cop-killings/ …
Don't you feel ashamed of yourself yet?
aren't you supposed to be smarter than this. You perpetuate racism:NOT ROUTINE TRAFFIC STOPS!
Then more training needs to for officers ESPECIALLY when All Americans have a right to bare arms.....and this is what we face!
go back to your lying world Pocahontas
@amyschumer I have to unfollow you Amy. You're funny, but your so ignorant that it's not funny.
Common denominator- the gun.....
And corporations shldnt $profit$ as cops and poc battle it out for fair/equal justice to prevail.
@nashvilleatty Captain Obvious...don't you think 99.8% of people agree with this. Mama's should love their husbands and children
on this day - and every day - ten minutes of essential listening for every american. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhANTymDIYk …
Maybe we should have all the facts before commenting! Just like Ferguson! Amazingly didn't see U post after the DOJ report.
@amyschumer the black community need to pull it together.committing too much crime,problem students in school etc.. That is it
