I hope you are cultivating your reasonable republican colleagues to reject racist appointments.
your white = your racist
no, YOU are white and racist.  I am white and not racist.
not according to the people in the riots. Sorry but if your white your racist according to them. The left has gone insane
If you endorse and support racists...you are complicit in their racism. Trump's swamp of cronyism is all racist.
the term "racist" means nothing. It's been so over used it has no meaning
and if you think ppl believing in racism and saying racist things is ok - then you too are racist.
you don't have a clue
.@SenWarren @SenatorSessions You aren't at all concerned about Keith Ellison's past statements object to Jeff Sessions' past statements...
do you have a clue about Ellison? He's as radical as the come. So far left can't call him left
Yes , so familiar he's blocked me.. ;)
good job!!!
My concern is the GOP members will just let it happen!
why is this a concern?
because this man is a known racist - who would be in charge of the justice department of the country. -
You people need a new talking point. Calling all Rep's Racists didn't work before the Election & won't work now.
simply don't care?? Or you have whole administration that shares your racist views? your pick.
As I said, your pick sweetie - you've finally got your voice, go get your white hood.
What makes you think I am a white woman ? My previous photo. https://melaniannews.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/tuskegee-airmen-at-attention.jpg …
Reading isn't your strong suit, eh?? I'm sorry.
- And you don't hold at majority in the Senate.  Don't you have better things to do than Tweet?
Is there an option for a recall election?  Trump is out of control and destroying the nation. @SenWarren
voice of Soros, #BlackLivesMatter, New Black Panthers, Black Nationalism, Sharia law!  Trump destroying nation?
:you like the Clintons you need to smoke one of Bill's cigars soaked in Monica Lewitzky
Elizabeth Warren moral? Give me a http://break.Show  where u got your money
@SenBrianSchatz I hope you and @maziehirono will follow @SenWarren ’s lead on this. /via @summerbrennan
If @realDonaldTrump refuses to reverse on @SenatorSessions, it falls on the Senate to exercise fundamental moral leadership for our nation.
You don't believe in unity do you?? Keep stomping your feet @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @SenatorSessions
@sharie_kaye - SO DO IT - MAKE IT HAPPEN - NOW OR NEVER KIDS ... #Focus
did someone say kids???
What do you know about morals, Fauxcahontas?
This is what he wants people to do focus on one thing so he can focus on his business.
you are awesome. Thank you so much for everything you do for our country.
@OhioDemocracy @realDonaldTrump @SenatorSessions @TheDemocrats party that operates by creating anarchy.  Never again Democrat
Sadly, "moral leadership" and anything in Washington are oxymoronic these days.
Please stop with the "libtards." The word has lost its impact.
:you mean something insignificant like the right to life as a moral obligation,
you had yrs to do that and did zero, time to put you out to pasture.  Your a liar and cheat
you lied about your heritage for votes, beat it
you love to LIE like a DOG. Senator Sessions even fought the KKK in his own state. STOP LYING!
Yes! I hope the Senate fights against Sessions' appointment with all its might!
you & your racist radical libs caused U to lose it all, Trump & GOP running the show now, so suck on the big one U have no power
Problem with liberals is they feel that they're important.
Senator Sessions is a VERY good man and Great American. But here you are with your HATE SPEECH
So your crying now, go back to mama and get your baba, liar.  Your NOT NATIVE AMERICAN, LIAR
pretty sure any moral leadership for the next 4 years will fall on the senate.
There's absolutely nothing wrong with Sessions. You supported H. Clinton, who mocks Christians!
that's rich coming from someone that embraces infanticide.
Do U listen to what comes out of your mouyh? I want someone as AG THAT WILL ACTUALLY DO HIS JOB
Get over yourself Pocahontas!
you need to check your facts. Hate for the opposition shouldnt be what drives you
sure am glad that the Dems broke out the "nuclear option", eh Pocohauntis?
- Lead the charge, Beth!
#Warren2020
Please ... you refuse to acknowledge God; you can't even DISCUSS "fundamental morals."
that same senate Sessions has been in and you've said nothing about
@DanielWhiteson @realDonaldTrump @SenatorSessions To quote Jefferson from @HamiltonMusical, you don't have the votes.
A word that doesn't apply to the incoming administration: moral. They're not. We must be.

Fake Native American refuses to meet with real one.
Go cry to your pal Reid Go nuclear option Karma catches up with DEMONCRAPS
"Fundamental moral leadership"? Really? Clinton Foundation?? We shall see.
You sound like a five year old, Senator Warren #FakeSenators
coming from the women that claims she Indian.
@maddow   @SenatorSessions  Truly concerned for our Nation.  Nepotism, blind trust, Is Trump not accountable to anyone? Help us
.@SenWarren  @pastormarkburns  
Congratulations to my friend & brother Sessions for being offered Attorney General  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CxkSQt8XUAE1QAn.jpg …
.@SenWarren Crying Wolf on Race: Top Sessions Critic Gerry Hebert Has History of Making it Up--

Dems lost @SenWarren Elections have consequences. Take a few puffs on your peace pipe & calm down. @realDonaldTrump @SenatorSessions

TOXIC NOISE YOU CACKLING CROW

Hey Pocahontas step away from the fire water you're drunk
