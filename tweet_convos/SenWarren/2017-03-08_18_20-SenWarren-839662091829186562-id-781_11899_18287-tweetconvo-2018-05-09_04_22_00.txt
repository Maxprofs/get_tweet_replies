Watch GOP lawyers admit that repeal plan will cut off coverage to millions  suffering from mental illness & addiction. #ProtectOurCare #ACA 
Thank you @SenWarren. #Persist #ProtectOurCare
How FAT are your salaries and comp plan Joe & Warren...time to give it back to us...resign now!
I think Trump should do that too
Trump takes a $1 salary a year as our President! something Liberal Leeches don't understand#MAGA #2a
where's the proof? WH won't release any to back up the claim.
Proof of what? Proof we have is Libs & Dems could careless for our Health & Steal our $$$
and speaking of caring less about our health, have you read trumpcare !?!?
Not sure about you, but this Trump nightmare is driving me to need mental health care.
And for those of us who already have mental health issues, it's making them worse.
209 roubles to you, comrade! How is the weather in Единая Россия?
; what is this administration doing to us?? Why?? It feels like they want to kill us off so only elite survive.
and not the elite either if they have to breathe the air, drink water
Specially those Hollywood Elites that Warren & Joe constantly hang out with...#2a
I would choose either him or Tulsi Gabbard as the House minority/majority leader for 2018.
Mental health is just as important to society as physical health.
if you were smart you would realize mentally ill people are already covered under ALL Medicaid/Medicare programs

GOP to the 42.5 million Americans who suffer from some form of mental illness every year: YOU MEAN NOTHING TO US.
he is going to help you ANYWAYS.
When will you tell your minions that you want to fuse OBAMACARE with Universal Care? When? Coward to tell the true
. Gop needs to get thier stuff together!  2018 democrats taking back congress !
stupid if someone is mentally ill they are already covered under Social Security Medicaid Medicare. Scare tactics
You seem like you don't know anything about the proposed changes
So they give the mentally ill guns and take away their coverage for treatment I'm starting to believe this admin is mentally ill. #ACA
Mentally ill people are already covered under Social Security and have Medicaid/Medicare coverage
turn on @maddow !!!
she finally show the envelope?!!?!?
...THAT was a BEAUTIFUL THING...To watch and hear....YOU GO JOE KENNEDY!!!!
I STAND WITH YOU
hey, if they want me without my antipsychotics...
@MartiCannon @RepJoeKennedy Senator Warren gets free mental healthcare.. needs it, and doesn't use it.
@comictonypowell @RepJoeKennedy Wonder if they will exact revenge now that @realDonaldTrump makes it easy for them to buy guns!
One Hard Act to follow this young man. He is ready for prime time. Proven Convictions Loyalty and A Pedegree.Go4it
It's absolutely brilliant. Way to press that lawyer, who thought he could just push his mic away. I love it!
keep the faith!!! #ResistTrump
They brag about what Ronald Reagan did with health care...reduced mental health care.  We're in trouble!
This will not end well. Except for the 4 profit prisons. A illness is a illness. No matter where in your body.
pathetic. Ryan's spent years coming up with this?
E Warren could use the mental health benefits asap.
why should govt or insurance companies pay for this, people should pay for their own treatment/mistakes
Please keep sounding off.  Thank you both.
don't worry. You can get it from your real insurance.
And they cut him off just like they did you. Truth hurts.They call themselves Christian, Don't think so.
What do you think a Christian is?
always proud of the way Kennedys fight for all people Thank you
I agree. Pls bring in Kennedy's. I value them so much
Kennedy's began their long career by breaking the law & will keep being Corrupt#2a
shame on U.The Kennedys have given more 2this country&helped people. We all make mistakes! Corrupt=Trump
Please help us. You are a Kennedy. Mental health needs you
. I think about this all the time senator and still wonder why you insist on leaving veterans like me behind. Shame
SHE isn't doing it. She is against the plan 2 get rid of mental health programs. Ask the Republicans
@Marc_Brownstein @RepJoeKennedy brownie, what happened to the biscuits playing the bay? How can we make this happen?
seriously! Maybe sen warren can help expedite. She makes things happen!
Marc...you mean she makes Corruption happen...Yes, I could not agree more...she isJOKE
YOU should b concerned about THAT one...except ur not affected by Obamacare or "Trumpcare" with best insurance available.
I like what Joe Kennedy asked. When will he run for President???  I like him!
"You can keep your doctor"."You have to pass it to find out what's in it". Dems,like good Communists,crammed O'care on all 2 die!
please Mr Kennedy keep fighting this
Next time the Dems want someone to give an opposition response speech, have @RepJoeKennedy do it instead of Kentucky Gov. Who?
Their plan is a repeal without replacement since 10 or more million people won't be able to afford it.
this new health plan should be the only health care option for all elected government officials.
that is just sickening. How do we grow as a nation when we refuse to help ourselves?
@FarmBoy_NE @RepJoeKennedy need to pay my poor dear brother 3/3
@FarmBoy_NE @RepJoeKennedy as it stands I have a brother who likes trump, I take it all out on him but eventually 2/3
@FarmBoy_NE @RepJoeKennedy what is she kidding?  After this everyone in America will need mental health care, 1/2
@EspeOppenheimer @RepJoeKennedy not 2 mention seniors trying to exist on retirement and 18,000 a yr for insurance. Many will die!
Thank you for forcing him to answer a second time after he shoved his microphone off to the side.

I guess you will need to go somewhere else for that coverage then
@rolandsmartin @maddow @MaxineWaters @CoryBooker @ldforry @RepYvetteClarke @davidaxelrod @ShaunKingBro @ava 
since most (many?) people who will get the shaft voted for Trump, why not let them suffer?
We need to eliminate healthcare benefits for congress because these millionaires can afford their own insurance.
Need TX 4 mental health,addiction,PTSD instead of incarceration.  More cost effective than jail,loss of productivity
@WeNeededHillary @RepJoeKennedy Alot of concern that health mandates would eliminate pre-natal care. How about no Mental Care
@WeNeededHillary @RepJoeKennedy Please keep at it! Thank you!
@sharonstone 
@mcspocky @RepJoeKennedy How do they sleep at night? People with addictions & especially MH issues needs coverage badly.
their plan is to sit & watch society collapse, then move in with arrests, jail time for protestors= less voters.
does it cover people who get tenured jobs in a field they pretend to be a part of racially?
Dems did nothing for 8 yrs to increase coverage for mental health care. All Dems talked about was gun control.
please keep up the fight to protects people!
Every day I wake as if I am in a nightmare. Then I find out that it is true :(
typical scare tactics
We have the perfect ANTIDOTE for Liberalism...Decided to give LIBS a Tour of Guantánamo..Free stay w-ISIS #2a
It seems that this healthcare bill says NO to women's health, mental health, the Old, & the Poor. So sad!
more demo crap lies
.@SpeakerRyan claims he finds the opiate epidemic "heartbreaking"
@SenWarren @RepJoeKennedy
#ProtectOurCare #ACA
1/
This is heartbreaking. A national epidemic like this needs a national response to protect newborns and others. http://spkrryan.us/2lbG2ok  https://twitter.com/News_Republic/status/830934658372104192 …
Maybe @SpeakerRyan can explain what a "national response" looks like…
@SenWarren @RepJoeKennedy

Watch GOP lawyers admit that repeal plan will cut off coverage to millions  suffering from mental illness & addiction. #ProtectOurCare #ACA 
w/Medicaid cuts &EHBs (incl mental health/addictn) cut from Medicaid plans?
@SpeakerRyan @SenWarren @RepJoeKennedy
#ProtectOurCare #ACA
3/3
@WhitfordBradley @RepJoeKennedy Our #socalledpresident is a pathetic coward. #baku Joe Kennedy rocks! #joekennedy2020
Liberalism is a mental disorder. What will they do without proper treatment?
what can we do?
@bleighto @RepJoeKennedy  this is unacceptable
@GeyserAngie @RepJoeKennedy unbelievable.
I guess we all better get our duckies in a row before this idiot bill gets passed.
ever since JFK listening to a Kennedy is like listening to a socialist trying to destroy America
You really need to pay attention!
@hallnoates37 @RepJoeKennedy So they have given firearms back to the SPMI population and now cut funding for MH TX?  Smart move!
what could go wrong!?
Thanks for fighting the dismantling of Healthcare.
As a prosecutor; 99% of people in court there bc of untreated/self-treated mental health issues
@KimDeaBueno @RepJoeKennedy u need to use your coverage!
what happens to those on the spectrum?
@CommonSenseSoc @RepJoeKennedy elizabeth your crediability lost when u backed clinton.
@Carolyny1948 @RepJoeKennedy this is soooo scary
Go Joe!!
we have an addiction CRISIS in our state-Ohio and In the USA so what kind of nonsense is this?!
everyone should care because many of these people will likely be in private prison  if they don't get treatment!
please stop this flawed plan! My son would lose his mental health care.
So short sighted...mental health resources help our society as a whole.
@billyeichner @RepJoeKennedy @ananavarro POTUS IS POSTER BOY FOR MENTAL INSTABILITY..and now HE won't be covered for it. #CRAZY
@billyeichner @RepJoeKennedy GOP Ok'd guns to Americans suffering from mental health with no access to mental healthcare 
Do you suppose we could get some mental care for the president?
Thank you for opening a window of understanding the proposed #Trumpcare. So important to understand repercussions.
Is it not obvious that we have no mental health care? It is not like they will add it in now.
We are Americans and our brains can automatically detect what a free person looks like.
Well, of course. Since they're obviously in need of a mental health assessment themselves, cut it off!
-when trying 2 protect "gun" rights Repubs believe&blame "a lot" on mental illness?! But don't want 2 offer help!!
why aren't Dems coming up with a plan to fix ACA?   Show Americans who is on their side
big shout out to Joe making his gpa, pa uncle proud

@billyeichner @RepJoeKennedy supremely idiotic move @GOP truly. Shame on you.
ties in nicely with mentally ill having greater access to fire arms, don't you think?  #trumpcareisnotcare
Tweet Tweet! It also doesn't help that those who are mentally ill are now able to own firearms...food for thought.
Thank you both for continuing to fight for ALL! The only thing Important to Trump crew is $$$$$$$$

Understandable why mental healthcare is important to Pelosi+Warren @SenWarren  @NancyPelosi @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan
the GOP's "most amazing best big healthcare plan" is blatant crap.
What? That is not right, my daughter has multiple mental health issues.
benefits for mentally ill r already too little. Crisis is being created n Congress doesn't care
@billyeichner @RepJoeKennedy Didnt Trump promote increased access to mental health care as an alternative to more gun regulation?
better yet Obama EO to prevent some mentally ill from gun access.
Give us the exact same health coverage congress gets.
That is the only thing you can do to make it right.
- fuck me. How many fucking kennedys are there?
What is the link to the video?
45 doesn't care about people: poor, mentally ill, elderly, cancer pts like me. if goes thru, lose all hope in gov
RECKLESS
It is a difficult issue, but one we HAVE to deal with. Severe depression and PTSD are Real.
Especially disturbing because this Administration is driving us crazy!
STOP BULLSHIT Lying tactics California Doctors wont Dont take OCARE plus IRS fine $496 is corrupt 4Forced Gvmt ins
Y do they care? Mental illness or addiction does not happen in GOP families. NO 1 EVERY SAID!!!!!!!!!!
Fear mongering again? Shame on you !!!
why.  By 2018 ACA will have no insurance coverage anyway, only state support health care.
do is all a favor and quit! Your views on anything is unexplainable you gave me a reason to switch!!! Shut up already!
The USA government should hang its head. A people are judged by how they treat their needy, poor, ill and elderly. Fail!!
u are so right
It used to be "He's got the whole world in his hands" w/ referring to God. Now,it feels more like its ref. to djt.
excellent piece and thank you, Reps Kennedy and Warren!
this terrifies me!
just what I want to hear. Mental health lecturing from a kook whose whole family is bat shit crazy
Expose this plan for what it is more tax cuts for the wealthy and little else fight for our Healthcare make them improve not destroy
this is very bad
I do hope #Trumps plan has mental health benefits.
Watching Ryan sell his HCB. Insurance is simple. Pay a little over time in case you ever need a lot, most won't. House always wins the bet..
@karenhunter #KarenRebels
Elizabeth Warren needs access to mental health cuz she one crazy lunatic
...So they have allowed mentally ill people to own guns while taking away their health care? #pretzellogic
disaster!
but the mentally ill can legally get a gun! Let's make American crazy again! #pray4USA
no one cares about what you think. Your a joke. Americans and your state are losing money because of you.
@billyeichner with the opioid epidemic out of control this seems like perfect timing. 
#bizarroworldorder
UNACCEPTABLE
@monteiro @RepJoeKennedy. This is an essential part of our homeless problem and removing mental health will obviously impact it.
2. I have access to the Tulsa international airport, but that doesn't mean that I can afford to go anywhere. Access ≠ affordable
your all head cases and should be concerned
1. I'm behind you 100% Ms Warren, but I wish people would not use the phrase "assess to". Access ≠ affordable
what an awful idea. #Trumpcare #theresistance #notmypresident #incompetentpotus @POTUS
We must fight to make mental health care a required element of insurance plans. Not a luxury.
This is synergetic with the other news that GOP has made it easier for folks with mental illness to purchase guns
but yet they will have more access to guns
go after @ExpressScripts for driving up drug costs. We need to consolidate the supply chain and rid it of thieves.
- stunning that some consider treatment of mental health issues as unnecessary.
Eloquent and right on target!
these programs aren't sufficient now. They should be enhanced and not cut.
YESSSSSS!!
DUH to providing monies to this cause!!!
(You are already doing this, Sen. Warren!)
his speech was mindful of the struggles
It seems like Republican lawmakers wake up and say "Which Americans can we screw over today?"
@makeawiesch @RepJoeKennedy this is coming from the same camp that insists gun violence is a mental health issue.
Another Republican completely out of touch with the needs of Americans! Not surprising!!
Bad news for Trump. He won't get the mental health services he desperately needs.
Very upsetting but true, we need more mental health care, not less
So take away mental health care support but you can use that money to go buy a gun. #GOPLogic
#ACA FACTS! Majority voted Hillary=pro ACA. Pres of ALL. TeaPartyPresCandidates rejected.KEEP ACA!! NOT doomed- no insur?UnivHC
I'm concerned about your mental deficiencies expressed with venom and anger in the US senate @SenTedCruz @POTUS
Make them admit who's making money from this plan!
so let's get rid of treatment but allow them to access guns?
as a social@worker committed to this population it already difficult enough to get services
that's not good at all!
yes we all know mental health is something you and @NancyPelosi suffer from and it should be addressed, so get out
..I've been a caregiver 4 husband w/ many Mntl Illnesses since 2005. Cutting funds 4 MI is HORRIFYING. Living HELL.
Thank you
Warren and Kennedy you aren't required to have this lousy Obamacare insurance why not improve it for those who do?
So is Caroline's son Jack also coming into politics? More Kennedy's the USA may survive
Mental illness can lead to bell tower shootings, radicalization and compromise safety for the general population.
Senator are you and your family willing to forgo your senate health care for Obamacare?
then they can hand out guns at the door
