I am old enough to remember when Orrin Hatch was respected as a rational voice.
@BarbaraClayton @SenWarren @SenOrrinHatch Me Too!  He went to the dark side when TP beat out Bennett!  Tail between legs!
could have retired with dignity
Perhaps Fauxahauntus, you should tell folks  about lying about your heritage 
Enjoying your ill gotten gains?
@SenSchumer @SenOrrinHatch Leaving the Democratic Party;;; Sen. Warren, you are a disgrace; Sen. Schumer; you were great, no more
Sen Ted Kennedy is rolling in his grave. Sen Hatch I no longer respect you.
said Dems walkout of hearings was most pathetic treatment he's seen in his 40years Were u watching #MerrickGarland
Warren is a totally illegitimate Sen. Lied abt heritage to get where she is. Rude & condescending.
You're morally bankrupt , Fauxahontas. You have many victims in your past FO!
Hey Warren, why didn't you tell everyone in that room about your profiting from foreclosures?
This is never going to end. #trump is going to destroy America
WTF!!!  Orrin Hatch's Brain Must Be Officially FRIED!!!  You Sir Are An Embarrassment To UTAH!
@SenSchumer @SenOrrinHatch
http://www.operationveracity.com/trump-scam/trumpinc.html â€¦
Whatever happens to 'personal responsibility' for rich people's decisions? He IS to blame!
@SenSchumer @SenOrrinHatch stand strong Sen Warren. We are behind you.
bullshit
he's stupid!!
@SenSchumer @SenOrrinHatch Liz the house flipper. Watch out the Cherokees are after you
@SenSchumer Pocahontas and bozo

Hand him a baby wipe so he can clean off his nose.
People should be judged not only by their qualifications but by their character as well.
This is the new secretary of the treasury,, the fox guarding the henhouse ,,wise up congress and do your job.-2018
Thank you Senator Warren for your representation and you fearless questioning.
@Marina_Sirtis @SenOrrinHatch lol ditz
ok shit lips!
how could we possibly benefit from hiring Mnuchin, one of the architects of the housing crisis?@SenOrrinHatch
@SenSchumer @SenOrrinHatch 
Let's talk about the chain of victims you have left behind! Take out the plank in your own eye!
these old guys seem far more isolated were years ago...My kids R 45y still homeless wo help #SocialSecurity
@GardDeborah @SenOrrinHatch where's the "tone at the top"?
Warren has a lot to say about the other party when the Dem have been proven corrupt over and over and over.......
that behaviour was cultural and ingrained in employees one and all ... leopards don't change their spots
@CookieCatsGame foreclosed on military families, the very people he depends on to protect him. Nice Payback. No confirmation!!!
wasn't there a .97 (or pennies) cent typo or mistake from a 90 year old. Figures may be off.
Exactly. And that is the point. People should matter.
@SenSchumer @SenOrrinHatch GOP don't care if regular people, the uneducated white voters will soon realize what they done
@SenSchumer How's it feel to have no power at all "Elections have consequences" Now you get a taste of what you did last 8 years
Oh, Liz, get real. Let's talk about Bill Clinton's RAPE victims.
Of course not @SenOrrinHatch ! You & your kind are will pay! @SenWarren Oppose! Obstruct! Deny SCOTUS!
Cclearly Hatch is a sham, cares nothing for the proceedings or facts. He only responds to the Trump and GOP lashs!
Democrats BETTER NOT FAIL THIS COUNTRY STAND UP & FIGHT TOOTH & NAIL!!! #NotMyPresident #boycotttrump
what about your victims with all the money you are paid,and also embezzle all you have to do is criticize folks we voted in
@SenSchumer @SenOrrinHatch remember that night ? All the parties planned ? She had it on the bag ? Corrupt media polls. No trust
@SenSchumer @SenOrrinHatch Dems just so sour & devastated they got crushed in election. Fake news polls. Thought they had it won
that response reveals a frighteningly callous attitude. US has govt w/o empathy, horrifying
Shame on  the heartless Orrin Hatch! SHAME!
@SenSchumer @SenOrrinHatch Pocahontas
I doubt the victims are thanking the Obama administration, incl YOU, for bailing out the banks and refusing to prosecute WallStreet Execs
Did you remember to add in your disclaimer? the little old lady you screwed out of her house?
@SenSchumer @SenOrrinHatch can we have 1 day tomorrow free of you Democrats vile, ludicrous divisive crap. Just 1 you lost!
@SenSchumer @SenOrrinHatch They were similar to your actions after the housing collapse. I recall you also  made a pile of money

Let's only cherry-pick someone's career and hope we don't get blamed down the road for creating an inept govt.
You disappoint me Sen. Hatch.
you are an angry, vicious and spiritually dried up, all because we didn't vote for hate
@SenSchumer @SenOrrinHatch Shame on you Hatch it is time for you to retire. You are so out of touch!!
He saved the bank & inherited bad loans made by others.  OneWest "serviced" shitty loans written by the TBTF banks
Fault successful Americans who follow the law for being successful? Been in a long time, why haven't you corrected the problem? He wants to?
How about your victims? You know, those houses you flipped from those who were foreclosed on?
@SenSchumer @SenOrrinHatch  these pics of trumps are the swamp pack
I am watching the hearings I could give better answers their Swamp Picks
@SenSchumer @SenOrrinHatch, Republicans turn the other Cheek! @realDonaldTrump is endangering America with Republican help!
@SenSchumer @SenOrrinHatch  Annoying
I'm sure if Ted Kennedy were around he'd yank a knot in his good friend Hatch's ass about now
are you serious @SenOrrinHatch?  You were elected to protect and serve the people.
@SenSchumer @SenOrrinHatch Elizabeth Warren is a complete idiot. Just a showman w/no real intentions to do good for the people
Warren's lying is so disgraceful a 10 year old asked me why she was rude & lying. Unsuitable for kids
Obama's appointees/nominees had little or NO experience. Who do you think you are kidding?NO victims
.@SenWarren @SenSchumer @SenOrrinHatch 

Do you think you could tone down on your histrionics? It's insufferable.
His "disgraceful" actions refin'd under the best integrity &ratings from oversight agencies/ LIAR
tell the victims to BLAME FANNY & FREDDIE the real culprits
@SenSchumer OMG Liz you are such a liar and everyone knows it... Obamacare is a disaster more fake news from a fake Indian!!!
I stand with you @SenWarren . Keep up the good work.
Mnuchin's 83 yr old dad is sitting behind him. Wonder how he feels abt his son foreclosing on countless elders?
Mnuchin says his dad is his mentor. That's really tragic. Either he's failing his dad, or his dad is a jerk.
@JasonLaCanfora @SenOrrinHatch good one!
@SenSchumer @SenOrrinHatch 

Silly me for thinking INTEGRITY a required trait for both banking and Sec of Treasury

@TeaPainUSA
You & @SenSchumer are a disgrace to the nation.
it's amazing how he dismisses the crime committed against our citizens.
your full of it
After the government you work for was complicit in housing crisis on why they lost their homes,hypocrite
Hey Liz what about the house flipping of foreclosed homes you made money off after people couldnt pay mortgage in Oklahoma
@dangillmor @SenOrrinHatch Funny the party that threw $millions$ at semen stains now sees integrity and morals as unimportant.
Like saying a pedophile's crimes are unrelated to his working in childcare
What about the victims of US govt policy throughout history? They outnumber Wall Street's victims 10,000 to 1. What of them?

@SenSchumer @SenOrrinHatch 
Sen Pocahontas, 
Please make yourself the face of the Party!
That will make Dems continue Losing! THX
@PrincessBravato @SenOrrinHatch amazing. Nothing to do with it? Guess his offshore accounts mean nothing as well.
Sen Hatch guess it's ok when rich people display reprehensible behavior that devastates so many people? Elitism
DEMONcrat vileness, and the sliced and diced Black humans MURDERED by UNplanned MURDERhood? Shut up.
@SenSchumer @SenOrrinHatch hey pocahontas, get out of the way so we can make America Great Again
And hers.
what an incredible hypocrisy from @SenOrrinHatch! This is ALL related to Mnuchin's quals. He doesn't care about Main Street.
Senator you have been in office so long you are part of the problem.
Sen Hatch That's BS and you know it. why are you defending this guy? Oh, that's right..you'll profit too.
@SenHatch doesn't want to see the relationship between qualifications and shady business
can you prove you are of native american decent? Didnt think so.  Lied to harvard and who else?!
@markl280 @SenOrrinHatch keep it up!
Could the lame Democrats figure out a more effective way to DELAY conformations?
WTF about YOUR 'victims'? How many cheap houses did you buy & flip after bankers foreclosed on the home owners? #LyingHypocriticalWench 
@LeslieMarshall @SenOrrinHatch How is that unrelated! The OCC falls under @USTreasury
@JasonLaCanfora @SenOrrinHatch #warren's a boob!
that's like saying because he's a rapist doesn't disqualify him from being a policeman
Tell America how  DISGRACEFUL Liz Warren lied about many things. Least of which her being NA to get $
@SenSchumer @SenOrrinHatch And Who among you enabled banks to sell unserialized mortgage securities
@SenSchumer @SenOrrinHatch Who among you voted to repeal Glass-Steagle letting investment banks run amok
@LeslieMarshall @SenOrrinHatch Wise. And we can fight back as soon as we stop taking big Donor and Lobbyist money.
@SenSchumer you both are the Swamp. You better not be purposely trying to delay these picks.
@SenSchumer @SenOrrinHatch woo woo woo woo
@SenSchumer @SenOrrinHatch Who among you voted to effectively double credit card payments with no help with exorbitant interest
Or are you referring to DEM & GOP failed tax policies?
Or do you mean the VICTIMS of Obama's HAMP refinancing policies?
@SenSchumer @SenOrrinHatch Who among Congress voted to make bankruptcy more difficult for ordinary folks
You mean the VICTIMS of Frank & Dodd's LOSE mortgage policies to promote unqualified buyers??
Unrelated?  Senator Hatch should be ashamed of himself for not seeing how relevant it is.  Vote no on Mnuchin.
@LeslieMarshall @SenOrrinHatch Bull Shit! What about the problems, You Democrats have caused? Kettle calling the pot Black!
@joncoopertweets @SenOrrinHatch stop heinous GOP
.@SenWarren .@SenOrrinHatch In my own experience the only thing that stands between me & other's greed are laws and regs introduced by DEMS.
.@SenWarren .@SenOrrinHatch I would like an explanation of Orrin's comment.  Why not?  Is he superior?  Please explain.
@TeeTweetsHere Applebees is offering 'Buy A Riblet Basket Dinner, Get Free Tickets To Trump's Inauguration' special!
@jkarsh Hatch says: Dems can't prevent GOPnominations. America can replace a lot of you in 2yrs. and Dems show why we should.
.@SenWarren .@SenSchumer .@SenOrrinHatch Coming from such an out of touch place, I doubt reason can reach him. I say let's watch greed FAIL.
Hatch in his old age seems to have drank the Kool Aid.
Unrelated? His motives should be questioned at every turn. The man should be in jail, not in the Cabinet. #StopMnuchin #TrumpCabinetShitShow
=politicians response 2 poverty stricken, disabled, unemployed, high crime, uninsured society
@SenSchumer @SenOrrinHatch #Dumbfucks like Orrin R what fails #Murka
Who is this monster Hatch? Who put him in charge??? Boy does he have an agenda to propagate greed!
Sen. Warren has no integrity
@SenSchumer @SenOrrinHatch Goes to character
Because having the fox guard the henhouse is a good thing.  
Can all Americans have an offshore account to avoid paying taxes or is that just reserved for the rich
Your a hack, if ever there was one. Couldn't even shake hands with DeVos. No class.
once again the dems show their total lack of intellagence with financial matters
if this were Demacrat you'd Deny in a NY min. Bipartisan issue. He will raid America.Deny all!
The senate will still confirm him. All a silly show .....
@RBReich Americans need to ask themselves is a bank's purpose to make the bank rich, or to serve customers.
Didn't u cash in on some ppl losing their homes so you could flip for profit? Yes u did. UR hysteria is ignorant
'Crooked is as crooked does...'
stop hurting Americans! Stop letting the rich fill their pockets!
if you are not going to live up to Utah's ethics, you might as well retire now. @SenWarren
We should judge him by what's in his heart, not his actions, right? Thank you for Sen Warren for fighting for us!
perhaps unrelated to qualifications but a direct window into his core principles. Or lack of principles.
so Mnunchin should not be held responsible for anything.
=> @SenatorMenendez  nailed the crux of one of the key issues. Tax avoidance for the Rich, foreclose on the poor & uninformed
What about the victims of the @federalreserve #Bank + #IRS #targeting+ #Congress does nothing.
someone steals your tv, they go to jail. They steal your house and they get a cabinet post #SenateHearings
Mnuchin 's past Hedge Fund biz sounds like a Pro-Tax avoider too, just like his new boss. We Serfs pay the taxes
what did you tell the victims, Sen. Warren, whose homes were foreclosed and the buys you made to enhance your pocket?
. Watch as these rich CEOs bring their cold corporate attitudes in how they deal with us common folk. Beware!
Tell #OrrinHatch to grow an inch or two. #boycotttherepublicans
Umm..yeah, no. He has to be accountable. Like we all have to be accountable for what we do
Are your disgraceful actions related to your qualifications? You embarrass our country madam.
just image if this candidate was a HRC candidate the repugs would b all over him. PARTY B4 COUNTRY NO MATTER WHAT
@RonWyden is my senator and I support and applaud his efforts on my behalf.
He's acquitting himself very nicely during the confirmation hearing.
-George Soros was his partner.So you will take no money from Mr.Soros and denounce his pact during your elections?
Mnuchin's action demonstrate greed, lack of character & a great whack of racism
#I believe Mr. Mnuchin was following the law put in place by the Obama administration
