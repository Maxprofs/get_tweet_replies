It's nice to see you fools at work this late.
Idiot!!
Sometimes you should just be quiet and listen.
That is because you don't know when to shut up.
She was silenced for reading Corretta Scott King.
She died in 2006. Are you insane?
How am I insane? She was reading this letter and was silenced for impugning a Senator.
That is just BS grandstanding and doesn't belong on the Senate floor. All citizens have the right to vote. Follow directions.
.@GBLynden Did you say the same when Cruz read Green Eggs and Ham to his daughters from the floor of the Senate?
Yes, fuck grandstanding and do work.
.@GBLynden Well at least you're consistent but speaking from the floor is part of their job.
Good, listening to you makes the skin of my ears peel off.
.@SenWarren Hopefully voters will silence you in 2018 when you run for reelection.
Amen friend!
@InSpiteOfTrump @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr @YouTube Why is McConnell there? Surely he's a relic of some distant past.
Nevertheless, you persisted and became a hero. Thank you.
That was the very best moment of the entire Session. Pun intended
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan and @RNC Chairs All Betrayed The United States During the Republican National Convention, Dealing DIRECTLY. with Putins Spys They CLOSED THE DEAL FOR THE TRUMP HACK. HACK!.  ILLEGALLY SEATED OVAL OFFICE RESIDENT OF THE U.S. !!
Nevertheless, Senator, keep persisting!! So will we
KEEP SPEAKING OUT SENATOR WARREN
Really? Silence a strong feminist like you, Pocahontas?  Boy! That was easy!
He had to, because you never shut your yap. You just keep endlessly screeching idiocy that makes no sense & wasting everyone's valuable time
Shame on @SenateMajLdr for cutting off @SenWarren. Sadly I’m not surprised since he and Sen. Sessions work to silence voters. #StopSessions
I spoke out about @SenatorSessions – until @SenateMajLdr McConnell decided to silence me. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVyq6kAN6u4 …
that is the 'hidden' agenda- voter suppression!
I hope you being silenced is permanent
It was an admirable war whoop
GO GET THOSE RACIST POWER MONGERS!!!
You are a crook.
So, the young lady who was just arrested for leaking top secret docs, she sure likes to retweet your junk.
Hopefully, the voters of Massachusetts will silence you forever!
Reality Winner used you in her twitter account Elizabeth Warren.
Thanks Mitch
Tired of these Dems wasting our tax dollars
thank you @SenWarren 4 being a true heroine!!!
@SenWarren IS ON HEROIN, SHE ISN'T ONE!
Not surprisingBUT VERY INFURIATINGI copied
this from a nasty trumptroll.
No way it was a woman's
acct-they just 2 pretend
but this one is SO MUCH better
Yeah he did, and it was AWSOME!  #BURN
Warren should never speak. she's a dumb ass like Sara
Hey fakahontis, you silenced yourself with your rhetoric Exactly how does one like you speak so much and never say anyrhing of substance.
STFU Pocahontas!
It's good...you should be silent pochantas...the garbage that spews from your mouth is wretched
unconscionable.
Mr. McConnell, you are a shame to this nation. You have been bought and paid for ten times over
What will it take to bring this evil man down!!!
hope that our nation's people are better than this. Boycotts of corps and people who support this. And all of us speaking up.
I hope so too but I must confess I am worried
I am too, but we must stay together and work as a whole. This is going to be a long fight
It's going to be a long 8 yrs.
8???? Diana, bite your tongue
The truth!
because you couldn't keep to the issues, had to pull out some ancient letter
Because showing history of racism & voter suppression isn't an issue to consider... Sure
wasn't an issue in 2006 when all those dems were voting for him.
Wtf are you talking about? The letter is from the 80's. Always been an issue.
#liar #hypocrisy
Deal with it
know your history, proven LIE, blacks asking to investigate blacks?
Idk wtf you're trying to say & I probably don't care anyway
 @godlessVG @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr You were silenced because you cannot keep your hole shut!
Please share your remarks and we can all re-share them on @SenateMajLdr's timeline. You will be heard.
If by personal soapbox you mean daring to speak the words of the widow of Dr. King.
I would call this a personal obstructionist soapbox:
Shes losing in her own polls daily....we will pick up her senate seat in 2018!
You can look yourself in the mirror daily supporting pussy-grabber-in-chief?
we have your back! #letlizspeak sent Kings letter to McConnell today!
THANK YOU @SenWarren for standing agnst @POTUS' terrible AG pick! Wish my KY sen. @SenateMajLdr wasn't on the wrong side today. Keep it up!
thank you for your courage in the face of repression! SenateMajLdr should be ashamed!
@votolatino @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr @YouTube Women of America we don't need to be mansplained too
This is not normal times We have been in crisis for a while and continue to be
Mitch McConnell is Pathetic. All he did was elevate your platform #imwithyou
funny thing about rules. You break them you suffer the consequences. You commies are powerless to stop anything the GOP does. 
THANK GOODNESS SOMEONE DID!!
please stop talking and vote!
Thank you for speaking out vs @SenatorSessions whose record is troubling @SenateMajLdr cares more for GOP than US principles
If so many Americans are outraged by Sen. McConnell's refusal to allow you to impugn another senator, where's the outcry?
hmm didn't  he silence release of RussianInvestigation during Elec?And wife has a cabinet post now?
Keep fighting, @SenWarren. We are with you. #StopSessions
this government is going in a direction that the world has witnessed before. #FascismUSA
#SADSTATEOFAFFAIRS. I would not have left. Carry me out!!!!

God bless Sen McConnell
I am proud of you Senator Warren. Keep persisting!
'45' AND ALL of his GANG are NOT QUALIFIED. McConnell MUST GO!
Why not talk about the 1.3million line of credit?
a racist will always defend racist...majority leader is a racist! Simply put!
Give them hell!
Thank you. We'll fight to relieve the power hungry of their power in 2018. #resist
Instead of working with Republicans to fix our country you rather throw tantrums.
The Republicans stifling free speech & being dictatorial again -- stand up to them, Elizabeth! 
thank you for finally silencing this hate spewing woman! She is an embarrassment! I thank u!
Senator Warren, thank you.  McConnell can silence you in the Senate, but he cannot silence us.
Hang tough @SenWarren this is BS!!!

Great Work!

: A woman silenced reading the words of a black civil rights activist against the nomination of a racist. The symbolism is thick.
Teddy Kennedy Kills women by drowning them to cover his DWI.
We are with you, shoulder to shoulder. We. Shall. Not. Be. Moved. @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr @YouTube
old racists have to look out for one another!
how can he even look at himself in the mirror? What a pathetic joke of a human being MM
Why does that rule even apply to nominees? Shouldn't.
Senator Warren is a Shero! Thank you! #ShePersisted
If this goes on, we ordinary citizens will soon find our right to free speech taken away.
To me this is the biggest disgrace ever. McConnell should step down.
silly #Pocahontas, you broke the rules #civility
The more power these gop nazis have, the more we lose for generations
somebody needed to do it...@SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr @YouTube

Senator McConnell and the presiding officer should apologize.  Without dissent, no democracy
This just builds the momentum of the Resistance. Thank you Senator Warren.

@swbrohoney @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr @YouTube His face makes me want to be sick 
That turkey necked fraud can't silence us all Senator. Please remain vigilant as will we all.
Glad to see it. Your tongue is loose at both ends.

@MrGeorgeWallace @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr @YouTube Keep speaking. We are with you.
@ggpepperdash @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr Eek. Warren, we hear you, we stand with you, now the WORLD has read the letter!
McConnell's act worthy of Cirque de Soleil: putting own head up his own KY  derrière.
Thank God the Majority Leader had the good sense to do so.
#fauxmustgo #GetRightBayState
Pocahontis, Take Your Seat and Shut Up BWAHAHAHAHA 
at some point near the end every Senator should read this letter on the floor. Let him get the crisis he seeks.
The silencing was deafening! Shame on the #SenateRepublicans
the idealism of Sessions is dangerous clearly he is unfit even as a senator his state is proof
I'm ashamed McConnell is my senator. Crooked senators make a career out of robbing us.
@Trumpnado2016 @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr  When you're reading from something already in the record & it's Blk Hist Mo.

Ive never really cared for him. Always felt like he's looking out for #1. Hidden agenda
@AndyRichter @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr @YouTube what a pig. So anti American. A modern day Tory.
Nice!. Sen Warren ordered 2 sit down & forbidden from speaking during the remainder of the debate on the nomination of Sessions
Thank you @SenWarren
Let's have all Dem Senators read letter through #Sessions hearings
#silencehervitriol
