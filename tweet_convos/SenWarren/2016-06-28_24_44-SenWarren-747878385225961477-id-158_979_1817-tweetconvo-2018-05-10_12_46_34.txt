@HealHealthcare @SenateGOP There is no epidemic. Show me microcephaly outside of NE Brazil. Follow the science not BS
It s the pesticides they spray that causes microcephaly!
Which may be the real behind GOP failure to fund #Zika research - protect Monsanto the poisoner @queenofunseen @realtruthkings @SenateGOP
Puerto Rico no increase in MC same with Colombia. Epidemic seems to have already passed.
the Dems voted against a zika bill that the GOP introduced.
Because it sucks. (duh)
Let's be honest, both bills suck!
Nope. The bi-partisan Senate bill was fine. The damned GOP House changed it to make it bad.
What is done by both sides and than when the bill is voted down, you can cry wolf!
The Republican bill was good to go until the Dems insisted on money going to PP.
Duh. yeah-for a sexually born disease affecting newborns--can't imagine why.
HOW! DNA result is back. Part frog part tadpole & part French poodle! Let's Pow Wow! @realDonaldTrump
agreed yet what about #Ebola
It's just a game to Dems, zika came here with illegals. No illegals no zika.
Was stopping corruption and Wall Street just a game to you?!
Oh boo hoo. Supporting a criminal (Clinton) for president shows just how little you care about this country, so stop whining!
Fact: @HillaryClinton - you are the only one candidate, out 20 who was running is under FBI investigation! You are Unfit to run!
fact: if you're running against a hollow orange facsimile of a human, you're fit if you have a pulse.
Is our justice system just a game to you???  Will you pretend we don't have one set of rules for governed and one for governing
when @realDonaldTrump is elected, your going to jail for all your hate speech so prepare to sell your house u lunatic
@ti@SenateGOP YES!! Marco was on television saying Democrats didn't pass ZIKA not a word about all they added to kill the bill!
@SenWarren @SenateGOP
I am not a Repiblican, but if you worked toward unity instead of bashing, it would help heal our country.  Sick of it
hey Liz,  are you familiar with the term "cucking?"
@SenWarren @SenateGOP
This is a real threat to women's health. If you care, vote yes on #Zika funding bill
@SpeakerRyan
Do-Nothing GOP Modus Operandi: bill on vital legislation; load w/ poison pill clauses, ask why not pass
you seriously think anybody believes you Pocahontas Warren? New Indian name for you is: Whines with Pantsuit
like camping on the congress floor accomplishes anything you fraud. Bring back DDT, problem solved.
@DayJojo771980 @SenateGOP Everything is a game to them, it's infuriating
I conclude @SenateGOP would PREFER a Zika epidemic, much as they PREFER mass gun death over not having that. @allanbrauer
Yes there a sick joke period. Along with Do Nothing GOP Congress. If they had to punch a time clock pay would = $ 0.00
This needs to be talked about more.Have seen posts saying Dems won't pass funding.This is GOP MO & why they need to go
People with divergent opinions need to compromise to get things done. Lead the way and do something!
until one f their daughters has a problem fetus.
You know in chess, same as GOP real life, pawns, aka poor people, especially dems/POC, are expendable.
Republican'ts are saving our money so they can spend it on the next war.
seems like a political game to you Senator, the buck stops with you and your dem cronies.  PASS THE BILL GET TO WORK
You really should get a brain transplant Lizzie.
actions speak louder than words...gop leadership ryan  mcconnell trying to take down democracy for fascist koch regime
actions speak louder than words nra gop koch agenda screws democracy ... koch driven rep agenda is the new fascism
actions speak louder than words...while ryan budget throws granny off cliff...he protects koch dirty $ foreign donors
@marcylauren @SenateGOP actions speak louder than words...gop playing around w/ zika funding and flint funding
@marcylauren @SenateGOP actions speaker louder than words...ryan protecting the due process rights of terrorists
@marcylauren @SenateGOP action speaks louder than words...gop does care about 30000 dead a yr from gun violence
#HillaryWarrentoWin So true..it seems this incarnation of the GOP know no shame ,nothing seems sacred to them..?
You are delusional. The Dems are blocking funding NOT THE REPUBLICANS.
Is it a game to you? You refused to pass it. Deaths are on YOUR NAZI HANDS!
Hysteria? @SenWarren @SenateGOP Zika,Microcephaly &Pesticides: Half-Truths, Hysteria& Vested Interests http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/03/03/zika-microcephaly-and-pesticides-half-truths-hysteria-and-vested-interests/ … #StillSanders
You're a sick joke- is there a vaccine against you?!?

.@SenWarren 
You and your colleagues must continue to fight for all of us We understand what is at stake Don't give up  #WeveGotYourBack !
Benghazi was a joke to you.
@masg66 ...Of course it is Senator! Everything is just a gotcha game to them!!
#PrincessHighCheekBones
it's goofy lyin liz!
@DebraMessing @SenateGOP add a killer virus to no him control.  They need to be voted out or in other words do your job
@DebraMessing @SenateGOP 
A) yes
B) it's treasonous
@Syndeess @SenateGOP looks like it!
@DebraMessing EVERY DEM & REP should be voted out. Start over with @realDonaldTrump and replace ALL of them
@DebraMessing @SenateGOP Perhaps they just want as many people dead as possible. #GOPterrorism
GOP played their game. Put up a bill, attach things they know won't fly , then blame everyone else.
@barnabas1998 @SenateGOP I don't think @GOP cares how many Americans die
Delete your account Warren. BENGHAZI
Call 'em out for the hypocrites that they are.
Great Obstructionist Party your days are numbered.
why not a clean bill this is more important than political ideology . Think about others that is your job
You need to be on medication Elizabeth! Your tweets are wacky!
Lyme disease and Tick borne illnesses have been ignored so why not Zika? We've been battling for years to get answers.
maybe if they were affected personally they would get. Show them a pic of a newborn that has the defect and ask the ?
The G.O.P. must want pinhead babies.  They think it will add to their base.  Look at Cruz.
Zero contracted in the US per CDC. What emergency. More slush funds for progressives.
@sherrilee7 @SenateGOP It's all just campaign maneuvering for the Republicans.
.@SenWarren, give 'em hell! 
@SenateGOP deserves it; they ARE a sick joke!
But the joke will be on the #Republicans come this November!
Senator These evil obstructionist toads #PaulRyan etal are ruining us & bare responsibility for ZIKA & #Trump scourge!
@MattMurph24 @SenateGOP It's a game.
maybe if you democrats weren't sitting on your asses literally but what you are saying is lies anyway
no Zika crisis,why aren't infected quarantined until it's safe for them to be bitten by our mosquitos,no more spending
@doodlebug0 @SenateGOP  Yes. And you know it since the President called for funding long ago. They wanted to load it with crap
@AmazingSOP1 @SenateGOP How can they put the lives of the newborns so important to the Pro-Life movement in danger? Dastardly!
Now we see Pro-Life stance of GOP is really about controlling women. Game is deadly to babies & families.
@SenWarren @SenateGOP
Warren strategy: Tie an important bill to an outrageous Dem proposition. Refuse the more reasonable one. Call R's evil
it is up to the Senate to PASS THE BILL, don't politicalize this Sen Warren, vote yes!  Just do it.
Can we get rid of Republicans in Nov, please?
sick joke is that you are not talking about your party...https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cl_cLt6VYAAB9Qo.jpg:large …  how long are you going to lie?
@realDonaldTrump I think Elizabeth is bleeding today
@FoL2009 @SenateGOP Yes.  Like gunsense, rebuilding infrastructure, social security, medicare, education #allajoke
Yes after hearing the response of the GOP leadership and the cowardly @MitchMcConnell Zika is just a game.
Elizabeth "I'm with the Oligarchy, Not You" Warren #SELLOUT #Hypocrisy #HillaryForPrison
Economically disadvantaged pregnant women aren't really a big part of their donor base,  so.....
stop fear mongering
so basically because of a pro choice gov funded organization wasn't getting $ and chems that do the job. You say no.
The GOP is only concerned about themselves.The pregnant woman who is living in fear from ZIKA is real. She is US ALL
then also because they wanted to have a temp release from EPA to spray pesticides to kill the mosquitoes
The Dems block it because none of the money was going to planned parenthood but instead other health care centers
YOUR THE JOKE!! REAL PEOPLE WHO ARE HEALTHY THINK YOU PYCOTIC. DO YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT OR HOWL AT THE MOON SO SAD FOR U
the only ones affected are women, the Senate thinks we're not really people worthy of respect or healthcare.
Warren is Hillary Pitt Bull full of Bull!
.@SenWarren @SenateGOP It's no joke to voters here in Florida.
Trump would get Mexico to pay for it. Quit wasting money
Are you some sort of sick joke? GOP put up a bill, Dems blocked.
GOP tried to defund PPH & Obamacare in #zikabill  Can't we just pass a clean zika bill 4 the kids?
where were you when white men brought disease to the native Americans?
The joke is you and Hillarity running for office. What a slaughter for Trump that's going to be. Lol. Ridiculous.
Take all your meds Chief.
#ElizabethWarren is a hypocrite who lies about her heritage, profiting of housing crisis & is #WallStreet newest BFF
is the country's future a joke to you ? is it all for political gain? is that why you're kissing up to Hilary?
yes
no ur the joke Goofy.
Jeb would be a better VP he brings Republican donor money and will help win swing states
Should have thought about that while you were setting in the floor sending out selfies. Dems blocked important debates
But damn I looked good playing Rock Paper Scissors...
lol 
you are the most useless loud mouth lying hypocrite
I resemble that remark!
But.... BENGHAZI!?!?!?
@SenWarren @SenateGOP
thank you senator warren for fighting for us. You are one of my heroes!
Meh...you could find better
get a better hobby.
Yes, Senator Warren. It's a game called money.
@POTUS takes money from CDC for #obamacare that coulda went to #Zika Why you and @SpeakerRyan need ousted #MAGA
save the outrage and drama.  #traitor
it shows their scorn for unborn children
Is working for working class and poor people just a game for you?
Just like everything else the @SenateGOP does, unfortunately.
Yeah right, and Democrats a squeaky clean! If they didn't pad the bill with their own selfish agendas, maybe it would have passed!
They're GOP Rebs They can't help themselves
This is as bad as pretending you're a minority to makeum big bucks teaching one class at Harvard.
I think all the Republicans with any sense of decency were forced out of the party. This is what that looks like.
Everything's a game to @SenateGOP.
One stop shopping in a  bill to kill as much as they can. No shame!
Very deceptive.
Said the guy who calls himself homeboy shitty
Do your parents know you're on Twitter?
... Said Shitty
