We the people r outraged over the pathetic attacks from u dems against the nominees.. SHAME ON U!!
all nominees are unqualified cronies.
Why r they unqualified?
If you don't know by now, it's hopeless to educate you, Richard.  It's cronyism.
So, u don't have a clue? That's ok.
Carson's appointed because he lived in an apartment once?  FFS, dude, read some facts!

and not for long - someone will kill him, or he'll be impeached.
Arrest him. He offered Valium to him. Against law to offer a sched drug to someone. This is a crime.
Seriously, this is a crime. If student offered another person a scheduled drug, cops would be called.
Roberts, if I offered your adult child a Valium, I would be arrested. This is illegal.
 The Humorless Libtard.
Trump trolls & bots are really out today. Yes, I am liberal and proud of it! Bye Troll
You're nuts, lady, I'm a dem, and even I will admit this is a joke.
Sad you feel that way. But Senators should be held to highest standards.
thank you Senators Warren and Wyden! This isn't a joke to people. Shame on Roberts. Disgraceful.
clearly you've never seen Al Franken - that dude's hands down the funniest guy in the Senate! 
He's never been funny. And Fauxcahontis is just as guilty. Buying foreclosed homes with insider knowledge.
he's hilarious. But anyway not sure why Trump fans are excited about a hedge fund Goldman Sachs nominee.
He's never been funny. That's why he ran for office. He couldn't cut it as a " comedian."
How about politicians that steal people's nationality? @SenPatRoberts @RonWyden
@SenWarrenBut it's Exceptable for you to flip homes and do this .Wow! We keep forgetting Your exempt!
Hey I think it's what got them the white vote for Trump!
dems love handing out #rx since most of their pockets are greased with #bigpharma payouts #bought
, it's Sen Roberts that needs to take valium to help him speak coherently.  Roberts needs to resign asap!
but maybe people shouldn't wear their feelings on their sleeves.
Senator Roberts is an asshole.  Of course, he is a Republican so it comes with territory.
Appears @SenWarren forgot her OWN record of purchasing foreclosed homes for personal gain! Laws passed by Congress & Fed policies R 2 blame!
What hypocrisy! Elizabeth Warren is a political hack! Lied about her ethnicity to get a job at Harvard, too!
she meets with Soros regularly. Always in contact with the boss of the Dem Party.
u failed to disclose a $1.3 million line of credit provided to you by Bank of America phoney.
pretty sure you did too
He said he would GIVE him a Valium which is a schedule IV controlled substance and is a federal crime. 
That joke would have been hilarious in the 1960s in an alternate universe.


we shouldn't bail the banks out. When they start taking home and can't sell them and lose money.
These communists are crazy. If they get control we can all kiss it all goodbye forever.
Horrified by my Senator's behavior #embarrassedkansan

 PLEASE do not let the GOP get way with this. Their ethical standards vanished on 11/9/16. FIGHT STRONG
offer a "valium" to "lightenup"?(Roberts). Americas battling w/opiates, Repubs slacking agn. Shameful
it is also a felony to share prescription meds.
yes, and stop further stigmatizing people with Mental Illness who require medication. @NAMICommunicate
Sen Roberts YOU should be ashamed for offering a Valium to Him. Disgusting!
showed a lack of proper decorum @RonWyden
Problem was Bill Clinton. HE FORCED banks to give mortgages to people who couldn't pay it back THEN sued banks who wouldn't do it
We have Republican  Senators dealing drugs now?  Lock him up!
Our chief purveyor of nonsense.
would that be Trump. Or Kelly Anne C word?
He's NOT stealing if THEY don't PAY their loan Have you EVER heard of "Secured Loans" #Fauxcahontas
love when brainless trolls ask established lawyers questions as if they know what they are talking about
.@SenWarren @SenPatRoberts @RonWyden Banks don't "steal homes" moron! They're security for the dam loan! Pay the dam loan! #DemHousingBubble
goes to show you the man is on drugs while on the job. Wyden been voting for you since you first ran!
@AntarianRani @SenPatRoberts @RonWyden Ironic that Sec. who made $100M mistake took home of woman who made 27 cent mistake.
will take two good years from Trunp to end Warren's political career. She's all in which i respect but couldnt be married to her
Maybe you should stop stealing from students with your fake education agenda. We take on debt while you live like a queen. #Fake
Rude and very inappropriate of you Senator Roberts...not something to be taken so lightly!
Sen Roberts' vulgar mouth & crass statements have been an embarrassment to ppl in in KS for yrs.
Remember, it was Dem that took the Ppl money and gave to Banks to operate & foreclose on the Ppl homes!
how much $ did you make flipping houses?
And maybe more voters should be outraged that a Senator falsely claims Native heritage. Just sayin'.
@JackieFarnham @SenPatRoberts @RonWyden Sen. Roberts comedy routine was definitely not worth the 2 drink minimum
your paid by stolen dollars as well. Let's end it now.
;Maybe more Senators should explain why the debt is $20 Trillion with nothing to show for it, Warren!
so we shouldn't be upset that drugs were illegally offered between politicians? Great example we set
Foreclosure isn't theft. We can agree that it should be avoided, but if you borrow money, pay it back.
NOT2 mention, pushing unprescribed phych drugs right before the public. R they "ALL" on valium? SMH
Maybe more voters too.
It's not too late,we can still stop impending constitutional crisis that's DJT.  http://nomorebroken.com/?page_id=2 
Senator Wyden, I am one of your voters, and I am very glad that you are not taking valium!
Or finance your nominee in HRC...?
GOP drained the swamp to put what they found in Trump's cabinet. They're all on drugs.
They stole my home. I even had insurance.
Time to drain the real swamp. You guys are going great. Oregon is behind you.
and isn't it illegal to offer your prescription drugs to someone else? And why does he have Valium ??
And, he had one in his pocket?? Ok, psycho. Your day job too stressful, @PatRoberts ? Need mental health day for lack of #ethics ?
 @SenPatRoberts @RonWyden
Thank you Senator Warren for being a voice of reason
@Buddhist68 @SenPatRoberts @RonWyden Completely outrageous comment by Senator Roberts!
particularly when Repubs claim to be looking out for the "forgotten working people" of the USA.
@msvictoria53 @SenPatRoberts @RonWyden Need questions about Glass-Steagall. Would Mnuchin concede it would have averted meltdown?
@msvictoria53 @SenPatRoberts @RonWyden Roberts needs an oral enema. Chairman should have excluded Roberts. Incivility.
@msvictoria53 @SenPatRoberts @RonWyden Tonerts needs an oral enema.
Agree w/all said, but parasites still here being PROMOTED! Talk apparently does not STOP them!
Congrats, I've never seen anyone trigger ao many trolls.
@SenPatRoberts, just say no to illegal Valium
You endorsed clinton for shits sake! C'mon lady.

Don't hear democrats crying when they took donations from wall street
Liz is a complete buffoon whn she thinks a bank actually wants the burden of the collateral over payment
Those kind of statements don't belong in Senate hearings. The voters may hear them.
Typical Republican
Like you Lizzy?
thank you @SenWarren @senfor calling out my Senator- nothing "honorable" about him
The American people were outraged.  Congress didn't hear us.  Now we are outraged again.  Listening yet?
No Ms. Warren, they are outraged at your mendacity, arrogance and disrespect of our PEOTUS.
you need to take a chill pill @SenWarren. Did you vote to let those who can't afford a home get a mtg?
Tomorrow will be a dark day in the history of United STATES #BlackFriday #NotMyPresident #boycotttrump
Senators are NOT outraged. We learned that when zero bankers faced charges for the bank-caused recession
@jjinmi @SenPatRoberts @RonWyden it is always someone else's fault with this lady.  Never will accept personal responsibility
Maybe the Senators should be concerned about serving with a showboating dingbat!
Just shows Wyden is above the norm, if they have to carry Valium to do their work
Seemed to me that Roberts had been taking too many Valium for far too long.
Have some peyote and relax, #Fauxcahontas

SenPatRoberts @RonWyden
mean woman
sounds like a good idea for you
not surprised @SenPatRoberts is on Valium.  Should drug test the whole lot.
isn't distributing a controlled substance illegal?
I thought that comment was way out of line. He had no right to try and stifle him .
maybe SeRoberts shouldn't drink the cool aid
Maybe the GOP should be required to say what they find appealing about utterly unqualified nominees?
Who the hell can afford vicadin now?!
How much Valium does @SenPatRoberts have? How much does he usually take? Is he constantly high? Prescription?
I think you have taken to many valium,Or took to much crack!
@gabino_58 @SenPatRoberts @RonWyden so should you tale a valium
I'm sorry that Pat Roberts represents my state.
This is why dems lost. Insread of talking about his Wall Street creds, they are pretend-mad over a joke
clam down Pocahontas
Tell Pat: CA wants its tax dollars back. Perhaps red states should swallow that pill & pay fair share!
The nominees facial palsy, in response to simple questions, signals his own need for anti-anxiety meds.
the vast majority of us will need Valium to survive the next 4 years #Resist
Yes, but that was an unprofessional remark. Also, now we know he's on downers. I'm furious at the adults
The #GOP could care less about their human constituents.  #SoSad
your going to lecture me about Wall St, when in fact you have many personal gains from Wall St? #hypocrite #ignorant
Give the faux outrage a rest Fauxcahontas!
yes same to me cuz lost home since Sept. 1st, 2015! From Eastern Savings Bank in Maryland!!! It kills me
The mortgage system might need tweaks, but theft is not the right allegation here.
Well the democrats set up the opportunity for financial shenanigans by forcing banks to grant mortgages to people who did not qualify!!
- Senator Warren, I've seen you talk and I'm always of the opinion that YOU need a valium.
Yet you enthusiastically endorsed the candidate of Wall St. Shame on you. You're no progressive.
is addicted to Valium. Thats what I took from this story. This was a cry for help. Like Limbaugh,hes drug addled
Maybe you should sit down and smoke some Peyote while the grown ups work
Wanna bet you have many, many skeletons in your closet? @gehrig38 will expose you fraud. #Fraudwillneverrespond
Do you still bring down that salary ALONG with your salary out of my pocket too? #Fraudwillneverrespond
&@RonWyden thank you for your service to our nation, and for standing up in this ridiculous sideshow of a transition.
What about so-called Indian Americans that get to take $400,000 a year from Harvard for? One class? #Fraud
How about those who are widely suspected of flipping house for profit in their day?...#Fraud
Warren is the epitome of INSULT to American Indians and American WOMEN!
It's a federal offense to give narcotics to other than named on a prescription.  Where's the arrest?
Maybe we should be more outraged at people who steal heritage and identities
like you did Poco?
Jesus it was a joke. Making a huge deal over nothing: this is why dems lost.
Maybe you should learn meaning of word STEAL & stop abusing language. @SenPatRoberts @RonWyden
@NickelNope @SenPatRoberts @RonWyden wow lots of constipated conservative crybabies below
As a Kansan I am very embarrassed that Roberts represents our state. Roberts has wrong priorities
AGREED! Keep fighting Our nation needs you more than ever!
maybe senators should have helped the majority voters make their votes count!
#valiumworks
Go, Senator Warren! Many of us are following you, in your corner. You are brave, strong, clear, correct!
THAT'S ALL WRONG...cyanide!
Some of the Senators and Representatives need to take SMART pills if there were such a thing. I wonder about their IQs.
Elizabeth Warren- sanctimonious hack.
How do you steal a house? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1igbdaDhq4 …
perhaps the government shouldn't have eliminated Gkass Stegal and allowed the disaster..
How many foreclosed homes have you bought and flipped? @SenPatRoberts @RonWyden
.@SenWarren @SadBeth1 @SenPatRoberts  
REWARDING a man like that with high office will only get Trump DISLIKED by MORE of his own supporters
Or Senators that claimed to be Native Americans and probably does not give a damn about home owners.
@DMiller_357 @SenPatRoberts @RonWyden 

Wyden-beyond rude & disrespectful, ignoring long standing senate norm to act like adult.
There is a reason I don't live in Kansas even though I am, by birth, 4th generation.

Extremely unprofessional. How dare you, Pat? We voters have long memories.
Sen, Warren please please ,look at what's going on Trumps team ,kill public radio , humanities and arts public TV..this is not normal at all
- it's xanax now a days - shows how out of touch @SenPatRoberts is with health care ...
We will not forget who stood up for us and who didn't
@2020fight @SenPatRoberts @RonWyden They didn't pay for their homes. They weren't stolen, the people failed to pay for them.
I Agree with you!
Don't take out a mortgage YOU CAN'T AFFORD!  PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY! More Left FAKE news!


Livin the life..hey

A US Senator defends bankster Steven Mnuchin, & disrespects colleagues in process
Pls b #TheResistance
Warren you and the corrupt Dems stole all the American worker's jobs. You are the thief. Get real
Pat Roberts forgets he represents citizens not Wall st Or Koch brothers
@girlsreallyrule Senator Roberts needs to live in the real world and embrace humanity.
The Republicans are completely out of control. Don't care about our country. Just their agenda
The distinguished Senator from Mass can Kiss My Ass!
the Repub Senators have no credibility after these hearings.Great material 4 http://campaigns.Party  1st
I don't understand why you're having these hearings. Your focus should be on proving trump committed treason. Ashamed to be dem.
It's the new Trumpcare: ''Take a valium'' @SenPatRoberts N'est-ce pas, Mr. Roberts? @RonWyden https://twitter.com/SenWarren/status/822110502625169408 … #USPoli
.@SenPatRoberts says @RonWyden should take a valium? Maybe more Senators should be outraged by Wall St bankers that steal people's homes.
Or, possibly, b outraged over ppl who sign note/mortgage .. then default on loan n refuse to leave home
GOP keeps proving ALL THE RULES JUST DON'T APPLY TO THEM!!
Funny how he can casually suggest some1 take a abused prescription drug. Is he a pill peddler 4 Valium?
And maybe they should feel outraged about prescription drug addiction instead of encouraging it.
Is that like dems stealing social security trust funds. Or stealing people's healthcare via ObamaCare
PLEASE, Dems, KEEP PUSHING BACK HARD when Repugs try2 deflect from issues&control narrative/sound bites!
@bannerite @SenPatRoberts @RonWyden But it would never happen to those senators.
stick a feather in your faux bonnet Lizzie
do you listen to what comes out of your mouth
You, Madam, are an #obnoxious#grandstanding#hypocrite.
@StageYaneu @SenPatRoberts @RonWyden Obama has kissed the posterior of wall St for 8 years! Where is glass Steagall ?
pretty sure #Mnuchin was hogtied to follow rules invented by an Obama program. Just reminding you of that #InconvenientTruth
I think I hate u more than Hillary Clinton and that is a lot of hate....
