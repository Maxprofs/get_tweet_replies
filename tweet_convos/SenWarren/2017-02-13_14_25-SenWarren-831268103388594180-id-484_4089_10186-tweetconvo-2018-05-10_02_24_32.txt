Our #MondayMotivation to keep up the fight is exposing #TrumpsBrokenPromises. Let's recap the ones on #WallStreet: 
No one is tough on Wall St. Obama didn't prosecute any of them & filled his cabinet with them as well.
All politicians are liars.
oh please!  He's broken no promises but you've sure tried to stop progress so he does. Lady you need to vacate.
lady YOU need to educate...yourself. Perhaps do a little research yourself instead of relying on FOX
why don't you open your eyes and see what is really going on with #SoCalledPresident
my eyes are very open and I'm very excited what this President is doing.
are you excited about the Russian ship 30 miles off of Connecticut.  You are as sick as him
why thank you!
yes, yes she is. Should take that troll of a #POTUS and crawl under the bridge, not me 
The kept  promises are even more disturbing and diabolical .
you said you were intelligent. That's a lie. #shutupLiz
Elizabeth do you have any grand kids. u need a life sweetie. U are not told but Democrats n women are sick of u
oh no, it's not Senator Warren we are sick of... keep resisting and persisting!
liar that's just one part if his psychosis
What else is new?
liar in chief
REALLY? A month into his Presidency, u dare 2 pass on yr judgement?Hypocrites!8 years of devastation by Obama!

the dumbest president we have ever had. Donald yr fired
Corrupt Trump makes many promises most are broken .
Sounds like Hillary the candidate you backed
Pocahontas is such a FOOL. It is an embarrassment to the US, and its party. Stinking fool.
@SenateDems how can dems get the fbi to act on the behavior of the djt admin? Why does Comey look the other way when it's repubs?
That's because #LiarTrump only cares about enriching himself and his #evilfamily. GOP are silent
Always have trouble understanding why people vote against their interests. Promises were lies.
I said I would build a #wall and alt-drain the swamp. Sad!
@MarleneUsaa1 If that wall gets built, we, ppl of the USA will be paying for it, and thats a given.
FAKE NEWS @StephenBannon said so. Sad and mean!
Trump lost the popular vote by 2.8m
please quit living in "Bliss"
@SenateDems  they (wall streeters) will soon have everything deregulated so we can go back to '08
Remember Barry Mcguire,  "Eve of Destruction" 1965. There'll be no one to save with the world in a grave....
Please focus. We are being targeted by Russian and North Korea RIGHT THIS VERY MINUTE !!!!!!!!!!! SOS!!!!
he's been POTUS for like 5 minutes. You on the other hand are an obstructionist.
@MarleneUsaa1 Liz, wait a sec. trump, flynn, russia, espionage.  trump'll do nothing.  somethings gotta be done.
It's a guarantee that if he promises it, it'll be broken. #LyingDonnie #45FAIL
Except for, you know, keeping half of his promises in just 3 weeks. Google is your best friend.
We're still waiting for your answer. Maybe you should Google it.
travel ban, until terror loving liberals blocked it, all in 3 weeks. Lib tears a plenty
What else was to be expected?
That he'd knock out half of his promises in 3 weeks... Oh wait, he actually did that. Cry more plz.
What about the promise to show his taxes? So we can see how much richer he will be
1. Those were leaked already. 2. Don't care, his policies matter and he's spitting them out rapid fire and it's beautiful.
Show me the leaked taxes
What about the promise of well paying jobs?
Or the promise to drain the swamp
@SenateDems I'm sure he'll just blame sore losing Dems for breaking his promises, doesn't wall st work in DC now
@SenateDems 
Liz can you name one accomplishment since you took office or is your only attribute to piss & moan?
and honestly did you expect someone like that to uphold honesty?
who made you judge and jury?  I guess you're  just tooo perfect!!
Boy did you come up with that all on your own?
You will not be silenced! We will not be silenced! 

#ResistTrump
Don't resist inpeach
Way better, thanks. #ImpeachTrump
Well we've had 8yrs of strangled regulation & #DoddFrank Under Obama, Markets are now excelling & SME's moving forward #Winning
yeah winning like Chsrlie Sheen was, that is hysterical
, Charlie Sheen was at his most relevant in his winning phase, since the first season of Two & a half men 
not when he was running around telling everyone he was winning. All messed up on drugs, he was st his lowest
He looked pretty happy to me sandwiched between two of the hottest adult stars man has ever seen.
He meant he would HIRE WALL STREET; sorry supporters he was just kidding!!
Are we WINNING YET!!!!!
the only wall being built is WALL STREET and we the taxpayers will pay for it is guarantee that!!!
tough on Wall Street? He hired wall Street, so much for "Draining the swamp"# Main Street is getting drained!!!
wtf, he's been in less than a month.
@SenateDems Wall St is so worried about his programs, stock markets are taking off like rockets.
how did you make $45 million working for the government?
hhmm ! He's been in office for 3 wks ! How much did you expect him to do already )
how many promises have you kept Warren all of your years in office ? Not counting for illegals
Liar Wants to line his pockets along with his friends. Blows my mind he's was elected. They will soon realize.
if you are tough on Wall Street why did you support Clinton?
Donald is a great liar and con man. We can't believe anything. Release taxes. Impeach him n Pence 4 treason
Traitorous trump. Broken promises and lies!
Sheep voted for him.
#TheResistance
#resist
and you are a liar ms Lizzie.
Your party's "hope and change" was an 8 yr broken promise and you condemn @POTUS three weeks in??? No class!!
He also called China motherf*ckers when campaigning and then cowered in a corner when he had to deal with them.
and that's what democratic said in 2008 then Wells Fargo happened?!
GOVERNMENT IS THE PROBLEM--#EndGovernment @Theproblemshow @mikebranc @ComicDaveSmith @MAHAMOSA @realDonaldTrump
why are you not talking about Trump and his loyalty to Putin? Much bigger issue. All you politicians care about is MONEY!
Calling out 45's broken promises is a good start - how do we get a full investigation by congress? T/Y in advance!
are you campaigning or governing?  we all know he's a liar. do something for us!
@GoodGreenGuru @realDonaldTrump hahaha. He's 1/48th into his term.....
Why do we feel like ex-wives of Trump?
@SenateDems  PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE  use this as a TV ad.  Show this to a bigger audience.
you said you work for the American people, so far you have vote NO on everything we voted on in November
@SenateDems you are funny. 1 month. At least it hasn't been a constant drone of blaming the previous admin.
Pocahontas the RACIST...stop barking about Goldman Sachs executives they "contributed" to your personal wealth.
Elizabeth Warren = Chicken Little....the sky is falling
recall the election
Delusional and a liar. Ugh.
Working harder for less pay in more complicated and dangerous jobs...seems like workingslavery #workingclasshero
resign now and save yourself and your party further embarrassment. There's already a petition calling for your resignation go now
article 2 section 4 of the constitution  impeachment for treason
clearly one of many broken promises.
@BernPress @realDonaldTrump Nobody seen Elizabeth Warren near #NoDAPL peaceful protest it's insulting.
True, but obsession over purity leaves us with no allies to fight back.
Hold them accountable & steer them to our track.
We are angry at her inaction and lack of courage. IMHO the solution should be reversing those two.
it's all about money during and after the White House.
how?
No, it was a lie!
#TrumpsBrokenPromises
a little patience always helps @realDonaldTrump @SenateDems
More lies/broken promises...
1. Tough on China
2. Whose paying for the wall now?
3. Hires only the best!
.@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump  Stop your lying, Lizzie! Trump took no Wall St. money, unlike Hillary.  Grow up!
What about your broken promises, Obama and Clinton's broken promises. Look in the mirror.
Has it already been THREE WEEKS, Pocahontas? He hasn't been ANYTHING on wall street yet.
People, just be vigilant! Watch what is going on as an American,not party. There is chaos, lies, etc
He just hires the guys from Wall Street for his cabinet
he has broken his oath to protect the constitution.  Never trusted him never will.
good job draining the swamp
Get him girl!!!  This American stands with Liz! #resist #fight #americansforamerica #checksandbalances
help us.
@SenateDems 
ma'am could you point out what Obama left so undone & incomplete that #Trump needs to fix? He'll get right on it, unlike ya'll.
@SenateDems . first you must figure out who will pay for the wall, then you build it. Taxpayers do no pay for it
Fauxcohontas drink much firewater and she no say she make big wampum with foreclosed teepees. She no good.
@ShamanSamantha @realDonaldTrump keep after it Liz. We're working with you!
Lizzy you took an oath not to LIE to Congress about your personal $1.4 million dollar loan, but YOU LIED ANYWAY!
you backed Hillary you freaking hypocrite. Pocahontas, you lost all credibility.
Bigly broken
@politico @POLITICOMag Did you miss this?
has one of the most popular tweets to @realDonaldTrump today - via http://PolitiTrends.com 
bingo! this resonates!
@SenateDems Elizabeth Warren for President of the United States!
@garlandgates @realDonaldTrump he's been POTUS for a shorter period than you claimed to be Indian. #potmeetkettle
along with that other "promise" to release his taxes after the election  #TrumpsBrokenPromises
- yep! DT needs to be impeached already! Beyond ridiculous! #WeWontGoBack
We need his tax returns!!
Maybe he meant sexually. He sure invited a lot of them over.
technically he is stopping Wall Street influence. Now it's just Wall Street control.
drain the swamp he said
we're choking on the stench and muck of this swamp trump created
Considering his record, RU surprised?  Says what people want to hear, then does whatever profits himself.
Warren needs to quit holding up our country. Dems lost. Get over it and move on
Matt...not about who won..who lost.  He is unqualified...lies...Look at his choices!
Remember when he called you Pocahontas?
That was awesome...
hahahahahahahahahaha, oh man these are the tweets that keep comedy alive.
you expected him to act like a real person-he is an orange alien!
For @SenWarren the only thing worse than a @realDonaldTrump broken promise, is a kept promise
broken promise, after another, after another, after another......
- Hahahaha! Let him get in the door, Lizzie?
I'm not as concerned about the broken promises as I am about the integrity of this administration
That is right Toni...that alone will create chaos and hidden truth. Keeps us distracted
we don't know what to protest and resist! So much! I need to buy stock in poster boards
How would you know? Give us examples that prove your point!!!
.@SenWarren @SenSanders @realDonaldTrump @CNN DEMs nothing in 8 yrs & slow to confirm shows Hypocrisy not to allow Americans FIRST, egos
We thought YOU WERE THE GOLDEN HAIRED GIRL TO DERAIL WALL STREET WTF HAPPENED? Trump basing is a waste of skill.
HilLIARy took millions from Wall Street. How much has been contributed to you?
u said u were a native American. That was a lie.
@SenateDems and why aren't you talking about the women's leadership meeting that took place today??
No.  It's a LIE
@SenSanders please keep running this with more Democratic  Senators
@SenateDems Betty you're girl Hillary got paid to speak to wall st! Trump isn't in bed like she was get over it
The dems, Obama and corrupt Justice Dept W/ Loretta Lynch refused to prosecute Wall St.
Can't trust anything he says #UnfitToLead
he thinks we are busy making lots of money in our new jobs he created
he lied- yet again!
the first of many broken promises....this month
@SenateDems @potus I am beyond disgusted and disheartened #TrumpsBrokenPromises
@SenateDems There's probably an avenue in Chicago named Wall Street. He did threaten to send in Nat'l Guard. 
Because he has people from wall street, who better to use them to be tough on what they know
like you full of 
Trump has been in for 25 days. It'll take a few more to fix 8 years of " hood wink" Obama politics. Delusional!!
why did u say you were Native American??
@Roxy4080 @realDonaldTrump
yeah, he was tough. Gave them jobs working for him 
SO FAR THE SWAMP IS DISGUSTING AND IT KEEPS GROWING  MAYBE IT WILL COLLAPSE UNDER ITS  OWN WEIGHT
he didn’t take as much money as Hillary did from Wall Street; what does that tell you talking two faced
you no speakem truth. Forked tongue give bad words. Can it please Senator.
Shut Up #PsychoHontas. We are 100% against anything you want!!!!! We can resist too!! I hope Trump keeps it up!!
and more to come!!
@SenateDems demagoguery out of the desperate mouths of senate democrats who can feel their power waning.
I am sure other broken promise was telling Ivanka she was going to raise her sales with him as president
Yes !!!
@john_vanacker @realDonaldTrump @SenateDems He said he'd take on Wall Street. And his cabinet shows he's true to his word.
nice line. Hope some of my followers are taking notes.
absolutely !
so tough that he's hiring them all to hang out in Florida every weekend w/him on the taxpayers' dime! #trumpgret
One of many....
Trumpettes, are you listening???
One really NASTY Woman. Total Hypocrite
not like he took money from them. Unlike your pal @HillaryClinton. Americans are done with you #clowns
It was never a promise, just rhetoric and lies to get elected.
@SenateDems Where are all those coal miners jobs? Where are all the jobs for vets? #TrumpsBrokenPromises
@SenateDems I just assumed he meant that Great Depression II was coming this autumn.
He's a pathological liar. We get it. Pointing that out doesn't help the cause.
What Dems need to hammer home is how this admin.'s deceit and incompetence makes us less safe and prosperous
He lies constantly.
move on...this guy is doing so many other things that he should be slapped on!! Republicans would be on a Democrat like   butter!
I quit counting those over a year ago. Face it, he LIES about everything. Now get him OUT OF THERE!!!!!!!!
@LeslieMarshall @realDonaldTrump I never seen before one Pearson with very bad feelings how @senWarren shame on you Pocahontas's
You were chastising Hillary for being to close to Wall Street and then campaigned for her. Little Hypocritical
