u r delusional! We want that swamp drained!  We want corruption gone!


All I can say is this, "Because of you, @DebbieGT18 @BAM4AU @SenWarren, we are in a heap of trouble. 

 @realDonaldTrump #MAGA

The country Republicans want is a country where the poor dying in the gutters is a regular occurrence.
Utterly wrong. It is a country based off of individualism rather than free hand outs
We the people for the people make a more perfect union.
you realize that Hillary supports those millionaires, right? Trump is indifferent.
Give it a rest, Pocahontas. Liberals don't work anyways, why are they so worked up? The contributors have spoken

All you liberals ever want is more. Your taxes and freeloading kill small businesses.
We think the 1% are destroying this country
are you serious, those things don't exist in his world. They are tossed out already.

I agree
we don't need a higher minimum wage

the CEOs deserve that salary and more. You need to take an economics class and call me back
Yep, this guy too
states set minimum wages...

your policy ideas on min wage increase is misleading the poor. Trump bringing in more higher paying jobs better
So as a civil rights attorney you support Sessions??
Weak argument. His extensive record of bigotry and voter suppression would suggest otherwise.
You can't "mitigated" hate. The facts are he is a racist and isn't qualified to be our AG.
@Solutioneer72 @realDonaldTrump how do we get him out????
how did you get your teaching position by lying on the application
econ is higher then it's ever been. All you dems do is tell lies, and miss info.
shouldnt he move his and Ivanka trumps manufacturing back to US. I mean, other companies have to so should she

what is COULD. Means you know nothing and are just trying to stir. Quit it.
BS. Personal responsibility.  How you love victims, Liz.
What is with all the hate Liz .. Let's give the man a chance.
Andrew, we've given him 60 days to pull his shit together. How many more do you propose?
4 years. Took Obama 8 yrs to destroy the country. He should be able to make changes in 4
Ok u looney toon.
Hey KitKat

I hate stupid women. Thanks for noticing! 
oh,  you're mean too! Why are you trolls so hateful? Your boy won!  I'd think you'd be happy!

your comment makes no sense? Why am I not surprised? Enjoy the next 4 years! 
Good!!  Government receives 2 much $$ & bennies now.  How did U get so rich, Sen Warren??  Lobbyists & Soros??
Senator Warren, you should donate your paycheck back to the tax payers! Put your money where your mouth is!
Sen Warren keep speaking for the people.  Wish more #senators had your passion
Funny. You want higher min wage BUT do not want to crack down on illegal immigration taking the lower wage jobs cheaper!
you are the biggest baby I've ever seen...stop whining
Liz, you know you're telling lies! And where do liars go?
what can we do??!!!!
Could?  Doesn't your crystal ball tell you?  More of the same as during primaries from you.  Bias, hypocrisy!
already has #NorthCarolina fired my friend when he took vacation time so his wife could have a c-section. #wrong
Why are you stirring the pot with ignorant talk? It's unjustified at this point. Just let things be for awhile!
What do you know about the Secretary of Labor nominee, do your homework
Apparently that is what his voters want, that is till they find they werkin for slave wages with no job security.
werkin?
Yes you know how to werk?
So many things could go out the window. Health care for millions is another.  We need to see the plan.
Elections have consequences ! U lost and besides losing..... all of u Libs r FOS!
COULD is the definitive word. Americans aren't stupid!
No shit, so remind me why you're legitimizing him by attending tomorrow?
very offensive to keep hearing Pence say how he's going to make America great again it's already great

how about we lower your salary and benefits
Damn straight, Pocahontas #MAGA
@ read a book on manners and be respectful to cabinet candidates...classless move not shaking hands with Ms Betsy Devos...
Come on, Beth. Now you're just making stuff up. You disgust me on a personal level. Please resign.

Let's see some serious consideration of a #basicincome.
About time all federal pay rates where checked
please keep fighting for us Sen Warren!
...you should go out the window.  Why don't you do something productive for a change?
Elizabeth.,  just saw Beacon Hill raises  are more than some MA workers yrly wage. Health insurance? not Ocare
He's Draining the Swamp !
Good.  Means workers may have to actually work harder to EARN their pay.
Thank you, Sen. Warren, for being the voice for things that matter.
More lies and pathetic attempts to discredit anyone she hates

Who pays for all this crap Madam!
Liar. You fear monger the low information morons (democrats) with lies and that's why they riot.
workers' benefits is the 'enemy' of businessmen, who, ultimate are about extracting as much profit as possible.
take Hillary's advice. Watch more cat videos. You are nuts!
This is what happens when you sleep on election day.  2018, set your alarms, folks!
@givemepie360 @realDonaldTrump yeah, you get what you vote...
you're wild annoying....but at the same time you madd real that's probably why you're so annoying.
trump should not allow his uber rich buddies to exploit the American workers
Paid work days too, as I understand his record
@lanah03 @realDonaldTrump do not attend inauguration. It's time to Act Up. Voters are watching
Wow gonna set us back before I was even born in 1951. Pretty demoralizing. Give em #hell, Ma'am. USAF Retired.

TRUMP is anti-American
Let's NOT LET THIS HAPPEN!

Odd way to stick it to the man.

Let's face it. Everything not nailed down is being tossed out the window except the kitchen sink..maybe that too
instead of tweeting, you should use #smokesignals to tell us #fauxcahontas
We've stopped listening Sen Warren. Go home.
since there is so much hate here I will try to negate by saying millions more of us share your philosophy.
way to kick ass today!
what can we do beside sign petitions and donate?

needs to go out the window for federal contractors   Need to go private
he thinks he can negotiate federal contracts that were the subject of public bidding.
You forgot lying sniveling fake beaurcrats too, funny, that suits you best, Fake-a-hontas. Resign and let the adults be in charge
.   Cabinet hearings PROVE the narracistic personality of trump and his cronies.  Thank God for you and Bernie.
Fauxcahontas paid $400K to teach one class #Dingbat @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
who gets paid sick days? #Disconnected
.  Ms. Warren, PLEASE continue fighting for us.  We need you more than ever.
Why don't we work on putting them to work before we start thinking of ways to pay them for nothing!
Don't complain - they need an extra Lexus in their driveway.
you get paid sick days the best health care and a pension who do you think pays for that Dizzy? We do why?
1/2 R u going 2 pay 4 it?! Y should the hard working middle class who spent time & $'s educating themselves, pay
should've supported Bernie in the primary instead of status-quo Clinton! You could've helped avoid this!
HEY!! You think PREVALING WAGES in MA are good for MA tax payers? Rip for the people of MA. LOOK INTO IT
the sky might fall also. Lady you complain about PE TRUMP tweeting but you seem to be on here more than him.
Notorious EW!! YOU ARE DOING AN AMAZING JOB! Thanks and appreciation from MA!
none of that helps bring jobs back to America. Listen to his message. Jobs jobs jobs jobs security security jobs
We're counting on you to keep up the great work trying to stop this insanity & get country back on track! Thank you! #ResistTrump
- how did a public parasite like @SenWarren become a multi-millionaire? Why did she vote against AUDIT THE FED? Hypocrite!
oh well if it has to go because we can't pay for it then so be It
he may have power but never a mandate. Illegitimate rigged election for Donthecon.
Thank u Senator Warren! One of the few actually doing ur job!
We are watching the horrid cabinet hearings, but it looks like they will all pass through. Don't let it happen!

You really should learn about the philosophy shifts that happened to the parties in the early 60s.  History.
more fake news from Warren
Billionaires r the victim in his world
not to mention Transgender protections.... Forget benes, no job
and that's just the beginning no living wage no Union no OSHA no human rights, it's take it or leave it.
Billionaire cabinet OK if invested in working families,Public Ed, lowcost Rx, quality health care&environment
Elections have consequences. Those are your issues.
FEAR MONGER
Great!! They don't deserve it
If only he'd go out the window as well!
Wait til he meets Theresa Maybe. She's wrecking britain in the same ways. Peas in a pod. Or is it pees? @ndylan1 @realDonaldTrump
The sky is falling too!! You better go and change your diaper LIARWARTHA!! @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
so could corruption pay to play and bills back loaded with pork
When min wage workers are replaced with Kiosks and they get paid $0.00 per hour, will u consider this a victory?
you wouldn't be fighting the President-elect right now if you had endorsed Bernie the moment he entered the nomination race
Hitting twitter hard Betsy. Hard to believe someone who faked being NA & earns $400K to teach a single class.
Blah, blah, blah

.@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Warren in MELTDOWN..This statement has NO FACTS & is misleading information.. #fakenews or just plain LYING
.@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Look, its the Indian, Pocahontas. Goofy Elizabeth Warren!
You know what else COULD happen? You losing your seat.
I thought ppl voted for T b/c he was going to help the working class. THIS IS WHAT SHE'S FIGHTING FOR.
ah hem... CONTRACTORS! as in contracted to do a task... as in have them negotiate a CONTRACT.
You know nothing on what a contractor is. they don't get employee benefits, they are CONTRACTORS
#WikepediaOfReality When a person feels good about there job, they're more productive.
BS, poco.
like your self respect when you backed Hillary..??
Making a statement like that shows your true idiocy. Lots of things COULD go out the window. Speak facts.
the self-dealing Left may continue to turn itself into a spent husk under Trump! 
baseless subjective comment;  Finally @realDonaldTrump is going to get the FOX OUT OF THE HENHOUSE!!
could? I think will. Not happy.
And they will. Elections have consequences.
Maybe if you'd been valued more as a kid, Mike, your hate level wouldn't be so detrimental.
Not "could" but rather "you bet yer arse it will".
This daft woman wants a huge gov controlling everything...because we all know how well government manages things
ALL Our American Values are at stake!
if Washington DC doesn't stop dicking us around there will eventually be serious consequences. Do ur jobs!
It's been my experience that when workers are treated bad, many bad things happen to that company behind scene.
WELL, we might have had a chance to have all that if "YOU" had supported @SenSanders as "YOU" should have. GET IT??? Hypocrisy 101.
Fight the fight Senator! Trump & staff MUST be investigated thoroughly! Must divest all business conflicts!
"hate" mongering --nonsense, you're subversive, a threat to our democracy .. @realDonaldTrump #MAGA
Bring it on. #ShopsatWholeFoods
He will be a runaway train, where he stops no one knows.
I think it might be a little more complex than that
Thank you for your dedication
Are we creating a working poor, an indentured servant class?
does this mean that you and the other hacks in congress have to WORK 365 days a year! freaking criminal
no jobs no hiring in free sector under socialist democrats like you!
Could but you have no proof they will so quit fear baiting and start working to make this country come together not apart
Unfortunately Sen. that is what his followers voted for without understanding exactly what they were getting!
What does a billionaire care?
The employers will suffer if that happens - no one will work for them.

That was his whole idea......don't ya know??
Don't poison EOs with your gender identity agenda next time.
