Ah, Karl, you do know he hasn't taken office yet right? That means he can't pull the plug.....yet
Don't need help. I survived the last 4yrs. of Obama's hate America term & his race baiting rhetoric
the fact is he is Pres. Elect and doesn't have to like for such minimal things. He did not admit any wrongdoing
U don't settle if ur case has merit. Trump U: scammer, just like his signed hats--done by machine!
he hasn't settled b4 now? Bcuz he believes he did nothing wrong. But he pd...at least he can own what
I've been in legal industry for years.U don't settle if case precedent on ur side.U settle to avoid admitting guilt
Total bull. Biggest example- insurance companies. Settle all the time because it's cheaper than trial
In March said he would NOT settle...but settled in November-- a major victory for plaintiffs. #conman
that #conman is ur pres elect u should show some respect.Really u should be thanking God it wasn't her
You're right!   I shall show him same respect that was shown to Obama after he was elected. Thanks!
.@SenWarren As you are aware, settlement is a way to make it go away w/o admission of guilt, right? #GreatMove btw
@realDonaldTrump
You're incredibly naive
tell her she supports killer Clinton's deaths in Iraq,Libya,Gaza,etc! stop #HillarysWars
@SSscoop475 @realDonaldTrump a world in unity we Americans come in all race of people we are united under God all race of people
#FakeNews
THATS NOTHING WHAT YOU HAVE DONE SUPPORTING ILLEGALS THEY ARE BREAKING THE LAW YOU  NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE
Walks, quacks, & pays $25 mil #TrumpHushMoney like the guilty Fraudulent duck he is! MSM will never cover - PLS RT
Bill pays 850 00 because he didnt rape right?
$25 mil to 6K victims is only around $4K each. How is that fair? #TrumpUniversity  #amjoy #maddow
of COURSE it's UNFAIR but then isn't EVERYTHING involving$ interactions between DJT&"working class"/poorer people?
You sound bitter
@MoniqueAziza @realDonaldTrump Tronald Dump
What's a "fact" is that @billclinton brutally raped @atensnut & @HillaryClinton tried to shut her up.@Deveshk1 @realDonaldTrump
and THE CLINTONS SWINDLED MILLIONS FROM THE HAITIANS AND THE AMERICANS WHEN THEY GAVE AWAY OUR URANIUM U DUMMY
You really need to find more reliable sources.  @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
YOU'RE A LIAR & A CHEAT POCAHONTAS. U STOLE NATIVE AMERICAN SCHOLARSHIPS AND JOBS #kanye #mars #blm #black #aclu
Watch the Cherokee People call Elizabeth Warren a liar 
https://youtu.be/lm3MYBDyNyQ 
what about President Barack Obama swindling the American people. #MAGA #TrumpTrain
@DavidKnopfler @realDonaldTrump that's so egregious 
NY Attorney General wins $25M settlement from Trump suggests massive evidence of #TrumpFraud. #AuditTheVote
Here is a fact. You swindled your constituents by claiming to be Pocahontas. #WorstSenatorEVER
@MelanieLieberm1 @realDonaldTrump How many people were killed under Hillary. Yep, that's what I thought.

Americans have a right to see the settlement & evidence...along w/ Trump taxes. #AuditTheVote
we also deserve to see ALL of hilliars emails and her foundations REAL taxes not the fake ones they showed
As if students don't have enough college debt
You see, a settlement, with no admission of guilt, does not establish responsibility.

Did you forget that?
ELIZABETH,WE THE THINKING,ARE BEHIND YOU,TARE HIM UP.
. I'm just LMAO that all his #Crooked stuff is coming out when he kept calling Hillary crooked, BAHAHA!!
Actually, it's not a 'fact'. As an attorney, you should understand that.
She knows that. Just more spin. DJT is bad and Castro is good. Blah blah
He is not above the law. He needs to accountable like everyone re: criminal activities. #CrookedDT
just like HRC was accountable??? Please! Oops my bad...she's still under investigation 
No she's not. She was cleared. Move on and stop pestering me.
stay tuned! 

No he did not and it is not fact. Fact is only that he settled He is the President like it or not. WE CHOSE HIM!
Yet, you backed a candidate that couldn't beat him. The victory Trump rests squarely on the weak & corrupt Dems.
it never was up for debate--it's ALWAYS been a fact--just like all his other scams & swindles
And all Hillary did was rip off the devastated people of Haiti. Can't understand how Mrs. Compassion lost Nov. 8
So now we have a swindler, proven liar, obvious sexual predator who's in bed with KKK & Putin > White House.
wait....Bill ran again?
So the president-elect is a fraud.... #NeverTrump
@tinalorentz @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Surprise surprise!!
he saved 1100 jobs @Carrier and hasn't even been sworn in yet...What did Barry do?
@MRbelzer @realDonaldTrump yes, paying a $ settlement of any size is an admission of guilt.
so by that logic...BILL IS A RAPIST
you swindled millions with your Fauxcahontas claim... and made millions flipping houses - you're a fraud.
. @SenWarren: @realDonaldTrump was merely expediting his court case. A wise move considering his upcoming job change.
Check Bills chair job at his university.He hauled
in about 17 million. Fraud
Bill who moron?
Do you not know how to use google?
is there  a point to your question troll with six followers.
I am sorry I did not realize I was talking to someone with 100 followers. You are crazy popular!
goofy name,  goofier picture,  no followers  dumb assed comments.  I never claimed to be crazy popular but I don't hide like an ass
I was doxed by alt:right. Pretty sure I will protect my family from racists.
: miss lawmaker a settlement not an admission of guilt you if anybody should know that! Isn't that slander
Uuumm..no, no it's not. Insisting that it is is tantamount to libel. You are lying, simply put.
But But But at this point Senator Warren....       What difference does it make?
@Toure @realDonaldTrump 
Fact check um.
@MRbelzer @realDonaldTrump #DonTheCon
@HillaryClinton stole money fr poor Haitians who need relief. Not up for debate! Fact! Hypocrisy #MAGA #Trump
@MRbelzer What's not up for debate-Hillary requesting a recount. She won the electoral vote 
and believe it can be proven.
Lock him up.
@DemFromCT @realDonaldTrump a settlement isn't an admission of guilt.  You know this very well Senator.
@Toure @realDonaldTrump facts mean nothing anymore.
but GOP/MSM pretending settlement no big deal. No principles for either.
you swindled America by claiming native american status for a free education, your not trustworthy.
Settling a lawsuit is NOT an admission of guilt. Shut your pie hole Elizabeth Warren.
Investigate Pocahontas's claim of being Native American
Clintons went from "being broke" to $150 million dollars rich. Pay http://for.play . where were u then
get over it!  Can't compare to corrupt Hillary!!!
Sen. Warren pretended to be Indian to take advantage of minority programs. Fact!
That's not a fact, that's your opinion. Liar! In America one is innocent till proven guilty. Or did you forget?
settled doesn't mean guilty. Even someone as ignorant as you should know that
No it's a manufactured class action suit . Dems voted against tort reform, and its abuses
I guess in next prz election, will hear a lot "crooked donald" from his democratic opponent
@SuZeeQP @realDonaldTrump now taking millions from the US to protect his family and a residence.
And People if Flint still don't have clean safe water!!!
the way the story is told to swing voters, not your base, matters.
.@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @gruber  next up, trump electoral college. it will be the greatest college!
At least Trump didn't lie about healthcare like Obama. Obama said if people their healthcare, they could keep it. Didn't happen!
#donthecon Give the students ALL their money back!
I REGECT YOU ! But who will listen ? KEEP QUIET !!

Time to move forward stop the crap Lizzie!
when it comes time to drain the swamp you will be part of it
if only facts made a difference to the people who voted Trump into office...
but he still turned a profit because I think he made about 14 million more. He should pay more.
Your friends Barack and Hillary have made lots of juicy arms deals to brutal leaders of foreign countries $$$$$$
What have you said about clintons millions from a failed university?  Selective critisism, non native american
And u let Obama steal Fnma and Fmcc. What a Hypocrite u are.
you swindeked millions of americans with your galf truths and outright lies, explain why we should listen to you
You would know nothing about swindling a college right? Like putting native american as your race on a job app?
Hi goofy let it go your re-election depends on it I hear a pitcher is running in 18! Strike 1 another lost vote
how about the job u swindled by pretending to b a minority to get a job. #pocahontas
@BoldProgressive @realDonaldTrump im glad to see it.
the history professor that predicted his win predicts he will be impeached. My belief is validated.
clinton foundation? Quit the hate mongering. You cant sanction one and feign disgust of the other
Trump belongs in prison. Let's stop pretending he's not a doubling-dealing, traitorous, tax-cheating, crook.

@realDonaldTrump
It's not a "fact" sweetheart; it's the civil suit version of "nolo contendere." FACT would be you're no Indian.
settlement has no admission of wrong doing what fact do you speak of ?
much like someone we know who pretended to be a Native American so she could benefit financially.
YOU swindled Americans with your fraudulent claim of being Native American. U embarrass ALL woman. #neveragainEW
wish people would see that. They are delusional and won't care
HRC accepted donations from many countries and pocketed them all. THATS A FACT!
Settlement does not mean guilt, It means less costly than fighting blood sucking lawyers like @SenWarren
when are we suing universities for not ensuring 100% of the student body has a high paying job after graduation?
we need thousands more like you!
Bill Clinton’s  nearly $18 million job as ‘honorary chancellor’ of a for-profit college was a real scam
@Suzyque1971 @realDonaldTrump time to move on and fix our issues
@gruber The election is over. So is time for rhetoric. Action and not words please.
Crazy that our president elect is a part of all this.  Where do you stand in regarding this: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podesta_emails …
oh, it's a "fact" but HRC was TOTALLY innocent with the whole email scandal, huh!?
Heap big fraud.
@gruber @realDonaldTrump Speaking of swindles: https://www.yahoo.com/news/m/185b2c6e-edef-3966-9fad-2996ef5de5be/ss_shocker%3A-in-wake-of.html?.tsrc=fauxdal …
unfortunately but not surprisingly, the media didn't seem to take much interest in this story
How did he escape paying $90M more to settle? Their lawyers should have got $300M.
Next up, he'll sindle the nation. We won't be able to sue him for that.
Sad fact is that a person without shame cannot easily be shamed.
Indeed so. As I see it, there's NOTHING good that that man has ever done. Half electorate has been hoodwinked.
Very true. Please don't be so willing to "work" with him. He must earn respect. FIGHT!
impeach and convict
this is a pretty dangerous line of thinking that undermines our legal process. Without a guilty verdict, he’s not guilty.
someone call her a wambulance...quick...#maga #draintheswamp
http://normanhooben.blogspot.com/2016/08/elizabeth-warren-is-not-problem.html …
. @SenWarren Is @realDonaldTrump guilty? Perhaps, but it's not a fact and you should refrain from calling it so.
. @SenWarren As much as I dislike @realDonaldTrump, this was a settlement without admission of guilt. That's the fact.
paying $25M is a tacit admission of guilt to most observers though. You don’t drop that kind of cash unless you’re worried.
Or you're someone who can't afford to be tied up in court once you're president. Makes sense.
yeah, he’ll need all the time he can get to focus on whining about SNL on Twitter.
Or running back and forth from Trump Tower. I do feel sorry for you guys.
me too. But to be honest, we kind of had it coming.
I don't think the reality will be quite as bad as feared, and certainly not the Armageddon some are wailing about.
my optimistic side believes he’ll simply be historically+hilariously bad at the job and Pence&cabinet will pick up the slack.
What IS up for debate is the intelligence of people who don't know the difference between a college and a correspondence course
@POPPER722 @realDonaldTrump and like with all his other law suits against him, settles without admission of guilt. That is unfair
and the university systems in 50 states do the same thing and you fund it.

, just a thief. Doesn't care how he gets his money
, trump is all about money. I do wish you would have run.

are you upset because he wouldn't give you a scholarship as a Native American? #SoreLoser #DemocratsForTrump
and you're not a Native American
Aren't you forgetting your real estate swindles?
Elizabeth Warren is a RACIST!!
what are YOU doing for your country atm?
.
What a truly disgusting and perfect example of a socialist "Professor" you are. You just have NO SHAME.
.
.
Is that unproven slander worse than taking a job from Native Americans, Lie-A-Watha? Are socialists liars?
.
killer Clinton slayed thousands of students-&countless others-in Iraq,Libya,Gaza,etc-a fact! stop #HillarysWars
when the liberals go low we will go high.#youlost #getoverit
Can you help American's understand how Trump's lack of ethics, no a blindtrust, will be stopped? What agency polices Pres ethics?
Bullshit.   Its all crooked media made up fiction.   Pocohauntus you need help getting in touch with reality.
These sort of 'pulling the wool over ppls eyes' has become a way of life that cannot easily be changed.
@HillaryClinton swindled children out of food &homes! vote for her because she's for women&children. Biggest lie of campaign2016!
Jail time for Republican club president???
A settlement does not admit fault. Any friend of the Clintons should know that. #soreloser #getoverit #zipit
But it's okay to scam a university falsely claiming to be an Indian?
You are irrelevant!!
said by the tenured professor who swindled her way into said job as an American Indian. #fauxcahantus
shut up you old bag of wind!!!
Get your head examined. You created a plantation of an agency in CFPB. Zero accomplishments in public life.

Elizabeth what Hillary did was worse than what Trump has done but you supported her
Given what comes out of Harvard Law these days, you've got no room to talk, Lieawatha. @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
.@realDonaldTrump swindled thousands of students at his sham “Trump University.” That’s not up for debate anymore – that’s a fact.
. Another fact is you are an extremist, arrogant communist... and a TINY, IGNORED absurdity. FACTS!
You mean like your Indian heritage. How that's 100 percent true.
Elizabeth Warren still angry& crying like a  spreading more lies on Twitter. Quit Warren! Nobody falling 4 BS!
But the piece of paper may have been authentic enough. Though imported cheaply, no doubt.
HA!  And he's going to be your President.  Just be happy.
says pocahontas, the great sham artist of the high cheekbone tribe
http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/04/17/elizabeth-warren-repeats-her-false-claims-of-native-american-ancestry-in-new-book/ …
look at the people & countries the clintons swiddled with pay for http://play.you  used to be intelligent what happened
How's that a fact? Because he decided to cut bait & focus on the country? Does anyone believe you?
quit exaggerating it makes you look bad get over it we're sick of it
< you !! Should be immediately investigated for your native  American fraud for without youd be nothing @realDonaldTrump
You don't know a fact from a hole in the ground.  Your track record on truth is oddly missing
Love Trumped True Hate-          We won
HRC swindled millions from the poor people of Haiti leaving them to die. YOU supported HRC You are a hypocrite
Shameful. He should publicly apologize to the families involved.
That's a false and misleading statement.  The sham is anyone believing you have something substantive to say.
is Harvard swindling students if they graduate and can't find jobs?  You make this way too easy.
sore loser pocahontas crying will be her for 8 years.
They got paid on their 'investment'. quit complaining so damn much and go to work for America
Shut your pie hole, dumbass! You're a liar and a fraud.
future ex senator Warren is a loud mouth cry baby. You should stop tweeting about trump. Election is over lost
"High crimes and misdemeanours". 

@realDonaldTrump
@tripgore @realDonaldTrump You are a complete Dod and I can't wait to see u go! The most obnoxious ugly woman I know

unfortunately those that voted for him don't care. Are there any ethical people left in the US
It's as much of a "fact" as your Native American heritage.
Dreamt into fact seems to be her theme. I bet she's fun to be married to. By fun I mean dramatic
BTFO
and? YOUR nominee was under criminal investigation by the FBI, TWICE. Not up for debate, THAT'S A FACT
