We need a different president.

not yet. He is so going to trip and get impeached. The funny thing about it is, the GOP will requested it
dream on lib. Get lost
The Fed Gov't should have NOTHING to do with student loans in the first place.  Return it to private lenders.
we need strong DMC leaders, don't give an inch. We're counting on you, Bernie, Schumer, & the rest, to stay strong

Indeed we do! Young people are struggling!

college has become another money maker used by
Michelle Obama 2020
please fight like hell to NOT confirm @BetsyDeVos she is totally unqualified Thank You Senator Warren!
I got an idea don't borrow fucking money from them that you can't pay back with your art degree.
Pay your own loans back some of us out here actually paid for college on our own. realworld
if u had a chance to do it sen warrens way would u take advantage of it?
what way is that?making people who made good decisions pay for people that makes bad decisions?

No way forget we shall over come
When did Germany realize they'd elected a Monster?  Let's NOT WAIT!  IMPEACH TRAITOR TRUMP!
Unfortunately Pence is a different kind of hell
True, but a more Manageable hell?
Yes! I leaned Republican. Trump needs to step down and let Pence drive. Dumb Trump
Government student loan program is a train wreck.  Blaming the servicers is avoiding the real problem.
college needs not to be so costly then students dont need so much in loans
I love creating new agencies to complete jobs that Washington cant
How about accounting for your terrible vote for an incompetent for HUD today?
We need term limits to get fraud #DEMocRATS the hell out of office. @SenWarren #Pocahontas #fauxcahontas #draintheswamp #MAGA
De Voe is involved in collection of student loans no to her please
PLEASE STOP THE DAKOTA PIPELINE 》>•<《
why did you vote yes for Carson???
what percentage Native American are you again? I forgot.
@JoyAnnReid Sen Warren you just voted to confirm Carson?! WTF are you doin. ALL lip service from Dems. You're in the swamp too!!
Why are you surrendering to Trump regime by supporting appointment of people like Ben Carson? You're failing your constituents.
did you seriously vote in favour of Carsons?
please impeach Trump! He only won because of Russia!!!

Will you be our first Native American President  in 2020? Pocahontas!!
Recent polling has found that  Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is far less popular than the Republican Gov. Charlie Baker
are you ever happy? all you do is spread hate, so sad! Always angry & yelling...  Chill out!
@OutFrontCNN So @IBM @GinniRometty gets a free pass from Richard Cordray and yourself.
@IBM  Senator how about IBM/Seterus who is really hurting the consumers and you allow this.
WHAT ABOUT REPEAL & REPLACE.? TRUMP HAS TAKEN 1 LEG OUT OF ACA " MANDATES ". ..WHAT ABOUT THE REPLACEMENT! !!!!!!!
or maybe people not changing 400 thousand plus dollars for teaching one class
yet you charge $400,000 to teach one course?
What about Trump passing DAPL ? Stop it. @CFPB @Navient
what happens to the IBR program that was part of the ACA if it is repealed in its entirety? I can't afford $750/mo
No we need good paying jobs! Most everyone wants to pay off student loans. Need to have the resources!
@ziskacomm @CFPB @Navient can you work on passing #ITC so @senschumer doesn't lose #NewYorkJobs @plugpowerinc
WRONG! All politics with the other 2 collection companies!  Dig a little Senator, quit relying on the press.
Nice  job, Senator.
why can't the federal government reduce the interest rate for college loans? Make it 2 or 3%
@facebook #discriminating against US Citizens for opinions blocking,requiring  they prove their complete identity!
well done!
Time to get fraud out of student loan. Sound of #IamNavient to support the cause @No42024787Karen @SenWarren @CFPB @Navient
Agreed, esp for people who lie about their ethnicity to get special privileges...
OMG Student loan law suit is the topic not division #IamNavient & student deserves better @MAGA_Yall @SenWarren @CFPB @Navient
And this time #studentloanrelief MUST be a part of the solution #IamNavient @SenWarren @CFPB @Navient
Is that so you can charge them 1000s dollars for giving a speech you hypocrite #putherdownthedrain #killarycrook
Heaven forbid that anyone has to pay back a loan.  What is this world coming to?
we need these organizations held accountable! Please stand strong for us, no one else is.
U destroys lives..$1400 a month until I am 73.. persuing higher ed has been a life sentence w/o parole
My interest rate tripled under Navient!
we want answers not rhetoric and excuses we were defrauded yet STILL we pay please explain the fairness in that
you know @DOJPH @LorettaLynch tried the accountability thing sued for 11bil settled for 95mil gave students 0 help
@w_fightback @CFPB @Navient Elizabeth did you mean Navajo
by the way WHY are u STILL allowing for profit schools access to title 4 funding &allowing fraud to be committed
would love a true response to this thats favorable to students/victims of the rampant fraud committed & abuse
dont 4get education &accountability were key issues in @HillaryClinton &@SenSanders campaign. Do ehats right by us
if you really want to show accountability and not just talk about decisions of accountability cancel the loans
ANY STUDENTS of EDMC etc or borrowers of loans held by SALLIE MAE &NAVIENT shld be cancelled. That wld be FAIR
Id like to know what you are going 2 do 4 us students/victims of their wrongdoing honesty,fairness &= 4 all right?
in any business you need customers it makes no sense to cite wrongdoing but allow customers to foot the bill
holding Navient accountable means nothing if you still have the students paying the loans. W/O us theres no them
What would be fair is for EVERY loan held by or acquired by NAVIENT to be canned  Its not fair we still pay
in addition  those loans started at SALLIE MAE then went to NAVIENT with inflated rates,penalties &still we pay.Y?
we STILL have not been afforded relief and EVERY doc the DOJ lawsuit PROVED we were defrauded yet STILL we pay. Y?
Please consider the THOUSANDS of former students/victims  like myself of FRAUD by EDMC/4 PROFIT SCHOOLS
And a strong Secretary of Education. NOT Besmtsy DeVos.
Thank you Senator.  Keep up the good fight!
You make laws about everything except college Tuition prices, maybe that will help students

warren, your a f•••ing joke, just another clinton-obama puppet
Go get them by the balls...

Yes my daughter has a big student loan to pay off.
can you please get back to the business that we sent you to the senate to do, like "Free Tibet"an hockey players!
go away Elizabeth
Why not hold students accountable? They signed a contract, received services, now time to pay up. They new the bill would come.
You made a FORTUNE as a teacher why don't you pay their loans. Not with your money huh? You screwed the system now want them to.
im a Navient student loan client and the interest alone will make sure i will NEVER BE ABLE to pay loans off .
i ve been tryin to pay loans off for more than ten years. what was a $8000. student loan has ballooned to $16,000.
lip service will not help former students straddled in NAVIENTS web of GREED. DO SOMETHING TO HELP US SEN WARREN
Navient is  denying TLFA (Direct Loan &FFEL) for FRIVOLOUS reasons e.g. using (/) on dates instead of (-). 5 denied so far.
@realDonaldTrump this is an example of government FOR the people. Mr. Trump - work with @SenWarren! She's great!
She's a fraud. Ripped of my Cherokee Nation. Charged $400k at a school. Wake up!
The @CFPB helped our family when our former mortgage company tried to cheat us. Thank you for fighting for us.

How can Navient raise monthly student loan payment from $410 to $1100??
What we NEED is a student loan BAILOUT for an entire generation of us that was sold a bill of goods! #bailout
Thank you @SenWarren & @CFPB @Navient is nefarious at best
just watch your back with @POTUS, @CFPB is against what he & wall Street want
you running for president in 2020? I want to see a woman there before I die. 
you are far is it means it's a racist fascist
Once a lier is always a lier. Give the people back the scholarship money you received by lying your were indinan.
: Yes!
Trump will straighten them out, Elizabeth.
Thank you for standing up to for the middle class!
Senator Warren, I have loans through navient, how will this effect them?
I have a story. Graduated college in 1994. Still paying loans because Navient told me to defer $70k added to debt
you shouldn't even be involved with your history of deception in this area. I am frankly surprised & disappointed
I'm aware of someone currently having trouble with Navient, they have been caught in lies. But not on telephone, so no proof
the critical function of government is insurance
Among so many other reasons.
Agencies eventually serve only themselves. Less government, please.
what's wrong with the student loan problem? I have some with @Navient and have no problems
I hope the @CFPB remains and is allowed to go after companies that prey on American consumer.
@RhondaRrusse @CFPB @Navient
you go girl! #warren2020
Yes!!!
don't let them destroy our country
Please run for POTUS in 2020! We need a fierce lady like you in charge!!!
Baaahaaa! You think Fauxahontas can win? Baaahaaa Baaahaaa Baaahaaa Baaahaaa Baaahaaa Baaahaaa!
strong president MORON
and regulations
are u proud of your women dressed up like vaginas and other things making fools of themselves? Nice constituency.@CFPB @Navient
.@SenWarren @CFPB FedLoan Servicing has been improperly shorting payments to PSLF enrollees by $.01 or $.02  causing payment disqualifs
good job.
I doubt we'll a strong protection agency from Trumps administration
No that's why we need you, Senator Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and Bernie Sanders!
Thank you:)

Been repaying loan w/them 20+ years, still owe more than original loan
This is a good first step in dealing with the student loan crisis.
You inspire me every day to keep up the fight. I am so proud to live in a time where my daughters can see your leadership.
. She is a racist and a fascist she believed in keeping the poor poor so she can control the masses
will DT get rid of the @@CFPB?
That's right! @CFPB @Navient
agreed.
We're with you, Elizabeth.  Keep fighting for us.

why arent you outraged that the CDC just cancelled their conference on climate change and health? dems asleep
Yet U lied about being Native American to get a teaching job 4 hundreds of thousands so you're why students R poor
they haven't done jack squat.  Turn the page.
what's the word on student loan forgiveness, Elizabeth?
why do you charge 400k for college a talk
