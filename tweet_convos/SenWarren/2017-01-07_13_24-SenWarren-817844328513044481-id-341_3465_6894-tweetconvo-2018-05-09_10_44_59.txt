Ethics seems to have absolutely no place in the GOP now a days.   Mafia, KKK, and Nazi is how they roll! #traitors
yawn.  So pathetic.  Absolutely no proof of any of this.

again, yawn.  Try thinking on your own.  So name one Nazi in the GOP.  Name one KKK member.
Republican senators Thom Tills (NC), Dan Coates (IN), John Cornyn (TX) and Johnny Isakson (GA) have How's4
it's a shame people come to this. I'm not even a Trump guy, I even accepted Obama. Guess I'm grown up
There is a difference between being grown up and accepting a liar, racist, thief, mafia, Russian loving traitor,big difference!
so not much difference from who we have now. Liar, racist, terrorist sympathizer, Israel hater.
Exemplary public service! But shouldn't the C in the first instance of "cabinet" be capitalized?
@maddow @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics be part of the solution not the Problem!
The Senate Sessions for #Trump picks start tomorrow so even if u have to leave a msg on ur Sen phone it's still counts
I absolutely love this woman!
@maddow @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics stay strong miss Warren we're praying for you
we need you please fight! !
Thank you Senator's Warren & Schumer.
I'm angry @SenWarren and every Dem Sen out there too but all we can do now is call our Sen and tell them we oppose all Trump's picks and why
Don't give an inch. Fight them tooth and nail.
@tlchimes @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics asking schumer about ethics may be a problem
@maddow @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics this eacko needs to just dry up
@Visitkarte @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics  No confirmations without proper vetting from Ethics Office and full investigations.
They must go through the same process they would demand of Dems. Are the Russians blackmailing them?
If Hillary had done this the Republicans would have set up an investigations not a letter. Time to get tough Senator Warren
Don't let up!

Can this be verified? https://www.buzzfeed.com/kenbensinger/these-reports-allege-trump-has-deep-ties-to-russia?utm_term=.nvq1w5oAN#.ud3WrNep7 …
@abuhena0044 @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics No confirm until all ethics & background checks completed. Stand firm Dems. #Backbone
- Go gettum Liz!! #Trumpfraudjoke
thank you!
At least her tweets are factual and not based on a bunch of lies and racist comments
Trump is still rscist. That hasn't changed.
what's your proof of trump being a racist? He reached out to many black communities and also he has many minorities on his team
so basically...what, Trump & staff get to bypass rules? How is this possible?
But the media are again trnsfxd with tweet to MERYL STREEP.  When they learn .
@maddow @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics just let it go
http://soquelbythecreek.blogspot.com/2011/10/everyone-knows-that-elizabeth-warren-is.html …
send in the clowns
Keep up the pressure. We watched for 8 years GOP stop good things from getting done, U can stop this
@maddow how ethical is it to claim and benefit from being Native American when you're not? Not so ethical Pocahontis!
@realDonaldTrump Has anyone ever seen a more BS letter from 2 BS Sens going to Dem employee in Dem controlled office
Very glad to see you're also concerned that  @OfficeGovEthics has proper time to vet nominees. Was just going to write you re: it
.@SenWarren @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics will you hold @realDonaldTrump to provide evidence of no conflicts of interest and releasing taxes?
Do not confirm without proper background checks and financial reviews, please!
Who are you to talk about ethics, Fauxcahontas? @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics
Is there a direct link to this letter?  Want to post it elsewhere.
@nastiestwoman @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics Pls probe on Trump's tax returns? https://www.google.com/amp/www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-businesses-owe-debt-18-billion-150-institutions-study-source-of-study-president-elect-a7512586.html%3Famp?client=safari …
Haha the facts. Wait your gonna believe someone who lied about being Native American for personal gain? Typical politician.
the rules are different for the Republicans
thank you senators!
the hearings MUST be delayed until these questions are answered

just do ur damn job or step down
Yeah right!
You should know; "We expect you too do nothing."
I knew you had to be involved. Disgusted. 25 Dem seats up for grabs in 2018. Don't push your luck.
and what was the reply??
@Tommy8668 DON'T CONFIRM ANY OF TRUMPS NOMS..the r all racist & part of the problem not the solution
Please continue to stand on your convictions. Don't let Trump divide and destroy the country.
hold the ass wipe to the fire they are a bunch of liars
@LaVerneWright13 @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics 
Good luck.  You two are the perfect example of how politicians should act
@maddow @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics sensing payback for Supreme Court nomination games. #politicsasusual #nothingchanges
@maddow @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics
These are the standards Sen. McConnell demanded in 2009 for Obama nominees to move forward... https://twitter.com/normeisen/status/818068447716409345 …
Don't let up! Don't give in!
Thank you
@realDonaldTrump   Pocahontas and ethics? That's rich! Hihowrya Hihowrya Hihowrya ! @DailyCaller
Thank you! We need a thorough vetting process.  What is wrong with the @GOP that they don't insist?

@ELLENRgtbabe @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics Jeff Sessions should be outright Banned from any position in the public trust. #resist
Don't let ANY appointee off the hook. Financial disclosures and ethics paperwork, or NO vote!
@SadBeth1 @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics So #McConnell wanted the POTUS picks vetted but rushing Trump's picks. So #anti-American.
No confirmation hearings until we know cabinet officials will put our interests before theirs.
Are you on the radar screen too? Nasty women every where want to know.
Thanks for pushing them to follow the rules of law. If they don't do this what is next?
wow... I like this..
@ClancyReports @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics
Mitch McConnell to Reid in 2009: nominee "financial disclosures must be complete... prior 2hearing being scheduled." 
@maddow @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics Check Jan 6 CNN Giuliani and Blackberry coupled with Trump team comment same day re cybersec
@metaquest @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics Great. Now, when they ignore you and push it anyway, you guys have to DO something. Ok?
keep the pressure on.  These people have massive potential conflicts of interest
SO NOW YOU ARE ONE OF THE SCHUMER CLOWNS.
Elizabeth Warren and ethics in the same sentence is enough to warrant suspicion anywhere on earth
blah blah blah blah blah!
Say.. @SenWarren are we looking into Indian Relations as well.. Tell us Liz, who's ur relatives again? @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics
@realDonaldTrump Why don't you clean your own backyard first?
thanks for your time and attention to this most important matter
2 fast - 2 slow - dammed if  U do & dammed if U don't! Get off your #Globalist BS & fight 4 USA#MAGA
Another mindless drone towing the DNC party line reading off a prepared script. Communist much.
how are things at the reservation
Liz has a feather up her butt.
didn't your party say you have to pass it to see what's in it?  Progressive hypocrites make me laugh!  Haha!!!
Thank you for putting pressure on them to fulfill their duty. We the people are worried.
Your a fake
shit stirrers hard at work.
@maddow @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics hold their Russian feet to the fire senator
@Glinner @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics Please don't let them get away with this.

@SenWarren
@CharlesMBlow

YES!
please keep up  pressure & use every available tactic 2 stop hearings until all docs rec'd & reviewd
someone can misplace the key to the room where the hearings are held, yes? For weeks. Even months.
@FemmesUnafraid @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics Might be using that filibuster sooner than expected?
But will they reply or brush you off? That is the question.
@dhfull50 @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics the party of can't get chit done strikes again.  Get a life!
noticing all those who oppose this are just throwing ad hominems into a tweet. no substance. SOP for GOP. thanks EW!
TRUMP or any of his picks could ever pass an ethics review..they are all CRIMINALS!!
@maddow @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics get'm pocahontas... Trump owned you.
How far down/back are we as a nation going to fall? who are your serving? the constituents or ?
Thank you Senator Warren!
what is the recourse!!?!
The hearings must be delayed.
tRUMP and his cronies don't care about the citizens protection.
thank you, Senator, should be a red flag for every American, including all our members of Congress.
@AnnTruwe @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics please resist Senator Warren our democracy is at stake. Please please please RESIST
-Hardly a bipartisan authority, he also has a personal beef w/ Trump ... so stop being an obstructionist
What DEFCON are we at?
@Jean_ie @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics Please do so. America is watching you as well as the GOP
we are counting on you and Bernie to keep the cheeto at bay
How ARE the "ethics" going down there?
About as expected.

grill nominees, if not enough time, withhold ur vote #conflictofinterest #GrabYourWallet #cut50
@Ike_Saul @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics Appreciate  the share but would prefer to hear your resolve to this lunacy.

Senator Chuck Schumer being a democrat has never had to answer for his racist treatment of poor blacks. https://spectator.org/47532_race-top/ 
Thank you for looking out for the American people.
If they don't respond mount a gigantic protest publicly and shot down government work!
@maddow @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics You better not certify any rich guys bc we 'know' you cant do your job quickly ethically
The bar is set pretty low:
Thank you! please stay on it and @realDonaldTrump We, the most of the people, did not vote for him.
Please do not allow these nominees to get away with not being vetted properly!
What are they hiding? Please resist holding hearings until all requested info has been assessed.
Please fight the good fight on this! Betsy Devos, Jeff Sessions= appalling!!
Keep on them, Senator Warren!
@CharlesMBlow @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics good for you Senator and thank you for your diligence!
@maddow @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics SC Looking for a position with http://Trump.Lol 
@CharlesMBlow @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics 
The hearings should wait.  Why allow any if this?
@CharlesMBlow @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics PLEASE hold these people at least to same standards as previous cabinets.
the Republicans have no integrity. we are dealing with the worst of the worst
We demand you follow the law! Hold their feet to the fire! Thank you for this.
@TheDesignerd @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics
@TheDesignerd @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics
No one should be considered for confirmation without the Ethics review!
@maddow @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics thank you for every effort you are both taking to maintain our democracy. Rough road ahead
@TheDesignerd @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics
@CharlesMBlow @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics ethics reviews must be completed before hearings begin
@TheDesignerd @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics
@maddow @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics 
Wishful words of wisdom... Let it be!.... HEE!
If only transition team would pick up the phone. PLEASE DON'T LET THEM GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING!!
Senators, Glad to have you in our corner. Thanks for looking out for us! 
Hypothetically, what happens to the hearings if information isn't forthcoming from noms?
If they're not done, no hearings; 6 in a day is batshit crazy anyway. Don't let them drive this.
@CharlesMBlow @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics In all honesty, Senators, do ethics apply in any way at all? The USA is being seized.
@CharlesMBlow @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics Keep up the pressure! #VetVetVet
@blindmellojelly @SenSchumer @OfficeGovEthics 
Why didn't you run for Prez?
Vigilance!
