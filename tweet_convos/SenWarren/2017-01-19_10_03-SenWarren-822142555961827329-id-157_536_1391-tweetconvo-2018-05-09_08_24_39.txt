Anyone with a human body will be hurt by pre existing conditions not being protected.
Sen Warren Koch Bros $$$ running that pony show
You do not have the intelligence or the information needed to have a clue
Midwest Oklahoma and Missouri about to have earthquake of the oil sucking century

Did you do this to Obama's cabinet? This is pure politics. Shame on you who is supposed to be an American.

: I care. Am in D.C. Got so sad & discouraged when they played "Hail to the Chief" for the MADMAN.
Why did you vote in support of Ben Carson?
stop funding stupidity such as #zika get the 2 billion back
listening to your questions during the hearings.  Very impressed & loved it. You should run for President 2020. 
Too bad didn't do this for Barry care. 30 mill lost ins. All Americans paying much more. Deductibles sky rocketed. Pass then read
Please stand up for us! Vote no on MNUCHIN . Do not let this man anywhere NEAR the treasury. Pass this on!
You Dems need a leader, why are you puffing another communist????
I suppose, when you have no qualities of your own you have to make up inferiorities in others...
Freeloaders unite
what do you call 68 democrats not participating in the process of governance! A great start! No integrity or honor! Cowards
Trump laughed TONIGHT "the other side is going crazy!" He's apparently going to be pres of only 1 side of the country
Every American will be hurt @SenateDems @YouTube
where was your concern for healthcare when we were told all those lies from obama about keeping doctor etc? Pathetic!
why did you and @SenateDems line your pockets instead of providing health insurance to families? #CORRUPTGOVERNMENT
Liar Warren.
liberals are going nuts because Trumps cabinet is so qualified, democrats are out, yea!
they should include those of us who are too sick to make it because some states did not expand Medicaid
NO ONE CAN TRUST WHAT @ElizabethWarren SAYS! SHE IS CORRUPT! #HYPOCRISY!
How about you host a forum of people who lost jobs, had hours cut, and pay more due to #Obamacare #caring


Warren shouldn't attend inauguration. She's mentally unstable and may try to commit violence. She's a threat.
are you kidding?   I just got health ins under ACA Jan 01.
why didn't care about people like me hurt by Obama care? Probably because you're a dueche bag.
Brilliant lines of questioning to Trumps picks. Are you busy 4 years from now?
How about those you already hurt with ACA?
@realDonaldTrump U R about to be considered obsolete! U look crazy and like an angry Democrat! We are tired of it
when is the forum for people hurt by Obama's health care policies... the ones that actually pay for coverage
Hopefully not all of them. That press conference would literally last more than the next four years...
The way she conducts a meeting and fights for the people,   #SenatorElizabethWarrenisbae
We now have a $6000 per year deductible. More  medical bankruptcies now than prior to passing of ACA.  Thanks @SenateDems
You are no longer recognized as a US Senator - see - it's that easy - pooofff!!!!

there's a meeting? Such to be you. We are all watching trump take over.

I was hurt by Obamacare, I can't afford it! Thanks democrats! I lost my insurance coverage & family doctor!
Fake
Next time Liz, attack me from your real account! Spineless
nobody cares,we're all paying too much to support the others, socialism doesn't work anywhere
have you completely gone off your rocker? Suck it up and deal with fact u had your turn, now it's ours
Typical democrats luring people into this crap. What they should know is that they don't have the vote...
Here is the most important moment from today's Mnuchin hearing:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc2o8ywKqos&sns=tw … via @youtube
I wish you would worry about the people.My health care costs have gone thru the room from the ACA
oh no need to talk about the price of the healthcare now we told you but eight years ago what would happen
Keep at them @SenWarren. You are doing a great service to your constituents  and our nation.
No thanks.
you have no clue who would be hurt as the policy isn't out there yet.  How about me with Obamacare -$12k/yr
Care to explain why my premiums were as much as my mortgage under ObamaCare? The UNaffordable care act scam. LIARS.
How about my family with kids - NO insurance because we can't afford it since you destroyed it. Thanks ObamaCare!
"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing."
It's a shame Democrats have become to weak to do anything these days.  We need a stronger resistance to evil men.
Excellent job on the forum today! I hope the Republicans can dig deep & find some compassion. Cut costs elsewhere!
keep lying for your divide and conquer;) your minions will eat it up!DB
NO go away @SenWarren @SenateDems @YouTube
We r about to enter a new world "Trexit" where a minority of Americans took collective leave of their senses
Trexit is Brexit x 10. @UKIPNFKN
Oh yeah here is a good one! Look at the KICKBACKS DEMOCRATS GET FROM BIG PHARMA. And u idiots believe the democrats are for the people..
Warren you have no class. If people were not FORCED into buying your crappy insurance no sane person would buy into your garbage.
another waste of taxpayer money!
what about people that were already hurt by Obamacare?
Thank you for your tireless work on my behalf
wouldn't that be all Americans that would be harmed someway or another?
ACA is better than the GOP health plan, which is when you get sick die quickly
keep fighting for us! Keep speaking up! We need you to stand up for us!!
@kaystowe62 @SenWarren @SenateDems I second that!
I'd love to attend and call u liars to your face. Lost my dr. Lost my plan.  But u won't admit it. Smh in disgust
500K for teaching 1 class ?

Uattack @realDonaldTrump Cabinet picks like an Indian on the War Path

Just keep UR tomahawk comments 2UR self 

 @SenateDems
Warren - you are nothing but a shrill harpy who has gone completely off the rails!
You make me ill!!!

maybe I could tell my story how my group plan got cancelled under http://ACA.Now  Premium $1,500 with $7,150 deductible.
Thank you for standing up for truth
I'm listening to @OnPointRadio I cried when I heard #russia is throwing parity & miniting coins in honor of #Trump

Sen Warren stop the hate! Time to get with it & work w the Rep. Ur making the Dems look bad. We lost help us all WIN!
You don't have a room big enough for all the people hurt by the ACA.
-it's a human right to live healthy! So I agree with you.
another make it up as you go session... lol
.
u r a petulant child
and so are you...
here's being a petulant child
Thank you
you are nothing more than a sellout fraud!! You care zero about the people, u sold your sole to Soros
Why don't you host a forum for those that had insurance that skyrocketed?
She won't...she doesn't want the truth about the ACA!

Do you plan to vote to confirm anyone or will you continue being nothing more than a loud mouth partisan shill?
why do you do that you don't know him and he don't know you. This is why Mr. Trump can't bring the country back together.
I think Trump can undo the divisive damage Obama has done, despite people like Elizabeth Warren.

I was hurt by the Democrats Healthcare policies . #ACARepeal
really? How? Explain how u were hurt by healthcare?
PS I had self funded insurance for 20 years until ObamaCare came to Arizona

Elizabeth Warren made $400k teaching one class at Harvard but complains about expensive college?  #wednesdaywisdom #Liberallogic 
call me for info on legislation for over the counter hearing aids !! Hearing loss is not well understood and isn't easily fixed
Warren you and your fellow corrupt Dems sold American workers short while filling your own pockets. Pathetic.
and your President got your vote to get more rich and leave your ass behind
Time to get real and explain why your pushing a program that only affects the middle class in a negative way? #LiesTheDemsTell
Why wasn't I contacted when ACA bankrupted my family? Should I wait by the phone or naw?
why are you using ACA. You out of 29 million is happy leave...but your on private insurance
I envision a Cesarean scene: Price ringed by the aged who are dying from loss of benefits, w/nothing left to lose.
requirement R? Bet U don't want your ppl to know! I have to make under 59k per year-that means ALL 20mill R covered in their home states.
What about about people who were hurt by corporate Democrats voting against cheaper medicine?
Did you know that in EVERY state-their is a state funded insurance? Also, to benifit from said insurance in AZ, guess what the salary...
It's not just the 20 million w/ins from exchanges. Over 150 million with emp ins will also be impacted by ACA repeal
went to the hospital last night with kidney stones no insurance bc of Obamacare and learned some really interesting things...
what hospital?
and so are you
what about the middle class who have been burdened with high deductibles and higher monthly payments.?  U ignore us!
of course they do. They deny we even exist.
count me in. ACA saved my life
I was hurt by 0bama's trademark legislation. You never asked me my opinion as a small bus. owner. #repealobamacare
Thank you, Sen Warren, for keeping up the good fight!!!
Trump said this in 2012 after he incorrectly thought Romney won the popular vote:
I defend my families healthcare by paying my bills. What's your plan?
