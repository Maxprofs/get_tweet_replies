Where was your "great concern" when Hillary was arming Isis and selling uranium to Russia? @SenWarren @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP
omg this uranium lie still
Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium Deal
however HRC never had power to sell uranium on her own...smh
how about kingdom of bahrain hosting parties at trump hotels after he won?
glad she lost, go protest, take lots of videos so i can laugh at you.
poor malynda couldnt face facts and blocked me ...shucks
Why did no senator join the objection from House members at the certification?
Yes. I want an answer to this too. WHERE WERE THE SENATORS?
wouldn't have made difference. Contested votes = 50 & even if 39 were thrown out DT has 270
even if contested EC votes out (highly unlikely) vote goes 2 GOP-controlled House & DT wins
So, it's hopeless in other words.
*jumps out window*
You're right, but it's a helluva battle without anyone inside Washington to help
@maddow PPL concern your delusional your a us senator..memo went OUT NOV8 LOST ELECTION FLUNKY
@javiermgonzales @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP Gov Ethics Office get to work! Do your job, stop excuses.
What excuses were those exactly? As is widely reported, Trump failed to turn over the paperwork for his nominees.
@jenscorpio83 @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP Read the letter.
seems more n more like a hostile take over of the US Government.  Are my reps helpless to stop this?
I've been watching, it's disgraceful the way republicans are treating democrats
@maddow @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP 
Your women's March  where milfs from hollywierd hang with feminists  
Oxymorons Much 
Would this be upheld in the Supreme Court?
@Jean_ie @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP America needs action, not concerns.
I want to know what is happening to the elders & retired if they take SSaway
Me too!
Can you explain why you lied about your heritage,Are you ashamed of Birth,heritage,parents?What?
@maddow @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP Haha! The Obama Offce of Gov Ethics? I'm sure they DO have great "concerns", & I'm delighted!
@maddow @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP
@maddow @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP someone needs to tell trump he's no God.  He is a crook and we are not afraid of him.
Just because he passed OGR doesn't make him OK. Climate change denier representing as everywhere? NO.
@javiermgonzales @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP Dems making it impossible to continue support DNC agenda.  Shame on DNC obstructrs
Would LOVE to see Dems band together and take a stand. This election is unacceptable in SO many ways.
What Kool-Aid have you been drinking? They did and they lost thank God!
@LeslieMarshall @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP
@LeslieMarshall @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP what can I say about this woman?
Thank you
I would like to see Presidential candidates fill out resume'. Maybe we could illuminate 6th graders.
people fear him. He buys them off. I wish he would pull so e thing on me. I will go 2 ct
I am NOT AFRAID of him, the orange pumpkin head.
Your entire feed is a deliciously cold drink in a sweltering desert. Save us!
Simple: you do not get a hearing if you have yet to provide requisite info.  #DoYouWantTheJoborNot?
.@SenWarren @CudBlay @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP
If Congress can't stop lies & lawbreaking by #Trump, US is in deep trouble.
#TheResistance
Pocahontas the obstructionist
Too bad. The clock is ticking. U LOST BIG TIME
Then push them with great vigor!  @SenWarren @redmcgraw1 @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP
@realdonaldtrump Seriously, @SenWarren We the People voted and would like if you would support our choice.
the only conclusion can be is that there is something to hide. We need to assure they have been properly vetted
so what can we do?
Deepest fear is that IF one slips through, it could be disastrous, especially with RUS involvement!!!
@maddow @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP Please represent me and my family by taking enough time to do a complete job! Don't push thur
Fauxcohontas, here's an ethical prob: HReid spent thousands on pic of himself
@emilylhauser. @OfficeGovEthics no certification should be given if ethics review not completed or rushed thru @SenateGOP
With the selection of these cabinet members they will destroy the office they are to uphold!
@DailyGrabBack @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP Do not allow these cabinet choices!
Do not proceed until ethics filings are complete @KamalaHarris
@maddow You need to make a plea to GOP voters to contact their senators. Go direct where it counts.
@ImNatZS @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP y do dems keep allowing themselves to b pushed around,R's are ramming  through cabinet picks
they can't allow that!
@SenSchumer dems r so weak and just keep getting pushed around
noms.arent giving back round info,then no hearing!!
@maddow @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP you go Liz make them follow the rules  we no how shady they are

so are Dems firm with NO aye votes on ANY confirmation?  It needs to be across the board.
Hahahahaha . Still calling the kettle black when your stench remains in the plumes of burning flesh over Iraq. #SoulessTrash
This is a requirement. Why is Trump & co. allowed to ignore all the rules? What if HRC had done same?
Obama's Speedy Transition "On Pace To Break All Records" http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/12/21/obamas-speedy-transition_n_152739.html?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004 … Remember this? 
Great. Do something about it.
We saw what you coordinated with Director Shaub in OGE. The ethics of that will soon be discussed.
please don't let them rush you!! You are our only line of defense left and we will have your back.
@javiermgonzales @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP "put on your big girl pants", obstructionism mks Dems irrelevant.
@tlchimes @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP as any obstructionist would. She lied to get to where she is now and is our ethics champ?
soros funds this fraud http://soquelbythecreek.blogspot.com/2011/10/everyone-knows-that-elizabeth-warren-is.html …
thank you thank you thank you.  Keep working with fidelity and integrity. 
says honorable Elizabeth Warren .... must be fake
@Trump is making a mockery of our Gov. and people like @SenateMajLdr and @SpeakerRyan are right in it
Don't confirm anyone until the ethics background investigation is complete and passed.
They bitched and whined about Dems confirmations, but not their own. 2faced
Hearings must be postponed until all checks & disclosures complete. NO EXCEPTIONS

I hope all vetting is complete before confirmation of Trump's appointees.
Please keep pressing for ethics. We cannot allow this maneuvering to be normalized!
Thank you for making this important issue public.
It is important to complete the ethics review before confirmation hearings.
@nytimes @Lawrence @DavidCornDC  We should all be Alarmed at lack of ETHICS GOP.  America UNITE
I'm pretty sure the Director will be replaced very soon. Thank you for your service to our county.
so ur damn job or step down
@askmcginty @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP YES! I'm including @SenateMajLdr to ensure his office has received the letter from OGE.
If they couldn't be bothered to submit necessary documentation, it seems they don't wan't the job
Please back Director Schaub and do not allow these hearings to take place until all docs are in order
is there no such ethics process for the president elect? Is there now American law? What a country
how about we look into your affairs, lets see where you lied and stole money for personal gain.
@maddow @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP This speaks entire volumes as 2 what the decent law-abiding citizens r being fed by this man.
65million voted against trump.  This is why.
@FoxNews @cnnbrk worthily of your report and extra media attention?
The people are watching, do your jobs correctly or we will retire you GOP
@Eykis @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP I have great concerns over election fraud! Do you?
@SenSchumer The American People who want to find out just how badly we are being snookered follow @Khanoisseur
@ Looks to me like you jumped the gun.  Not nominees until He takes office.  * refer/ read footnotes.
Great job looking out for all of us @SenWarren @OfficeGovEthics 
@SenSchumer @SenSanders what specific steps should citizens request to change schedule/process #Confirmation
@realDonaldTrump @SenWarren @StopBigMoney @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP What shameful secrets are Trump & his nominees so anxious to conceal?
I can't wait till Curt Shilling takes your job. The world is a better place with you out of the Sen.
@CaptainsLog2017 @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP The hearings must NOT go forward unless and until the OGE can complete its work!
is there any teeth behind this statement? Will anything be done?
Lighten up, Liz!
#gloom
- Who cares.  What are @SenateDems going to do to delay hearings.
@CaptainsLog2017 @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP Amazed that GOP leaders do not require PEOTUS to conform with these requirements?!
@CaptainsLog2017 @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP and the Trump camp's response was pure propaganda from Goebbles 101.
please also investigate Trump's allegiance to Russia. Ultimate corruption. #Illegitimatepresident
Apparently SpongeBob & Patrick are taking office. ITS OPPOSITE DAY!! Of course these swamp things don't want to be vetted.
@Michelle9647 @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP RESIST Fascism and Radical Zionism. http://ln.is/org/imzHJ 
Stop this Mad Man!!!
This is nightmare!
they wrote a letter that you asked Obama's minion to write. What abt Obama's nom tax cheeter?
@SarahPeas @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP but when Obama did this very thing you said nothing. This is why Americans voted this way.
should have been a concern about you getting in office. Hopefully things change during your election.
Big whoop, like Americans care about your little hissy fits?
The Dems know a thing or two about running out the clock
Gov Ethics Office FULL of HACKS afraid of downsized SWAMP just getting in the way!!!!
didn't your party say you have to pass it to see what's in it?  Progressive hypocrites make me laugh!  Haha!!!
taxes return for all of them include President elect Donald  Trump's taxes return.
The American people want to see Trump Taxes&returns.
amazing how warren copycats trump by getting on social media and then bad mouths trump. Hypocrite
THANK U SO MUCH
Senator Warren,I'm So Grateful 4 U
 everyday.I'm sure it must feel so frustrating!
@maddow @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP GOP tried to dismantle Ethics Comm & now are unethically pushing noms thru before vet finish
That's good news, please make sure your/our party doesn't let us down as you did on Friday. #TheResistance
Maybe the democrats shouldn't have changed the rules. Good luck stopping this, Pocahontas.
the American people do not think it is too much to ask for a routine process to take place.
@realDonaldTrump

Let's be honest: ethics work should be fully complete prior to nominee announcement
We are n waters that rough fails 2 adequately describe. The GOP believes it is having a dream but itsa nightmare
no wonder the GOP tried to dismantle the OGE!!
#lockthemallup
- Anything about lying about your native American heritage? All good there?
@PattyMurray @mariacantwell You all need to support Elizabeth
Please continue this kind of transparency. Thank you
I dont think anybody cares ...... msybe a couple.
@SenateDems
Everyone should read the letter. 
Confirm w/o OGE Certification  violates federal law.
Mr Trump's conflict of interest as President and business man may wip up the sea, goodluck to Jona
How do we stop this illegal and reckless behavior?
very concerned.
If there was a more imperative time 4 them 2 be extremely vigilant, I've never seen it in my lifetime
@Varidienne @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP Fix this GOP shit or I quit!
@Varidienne @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP Stop!  I'm not voting unless there are liberal candidates!!

I'm sure you are scheming away to block Trump's  cabinet picks! I hope you go far, far away lady!
Trump response was a giant FU.
This is Trumps giant "Fuck You" response to the Office  of Government Ethics. https://twitter.com/reenajf/status/817844396074958848 …
if they don't follow the rules, they don't get into offices!!!
Can't you put a secret hold on nominees?
But what grounds to stop it!
thank you senator Warren...we need transparency
You're just playing politics and trying to slow down Trump. You are what's wrong with Washington
Are American citizens helpless to limit powers of incoming POTUS until ethical questions resolved?
The people that run our country should have to pass more stringent evals than we do in our jobs x100
2/2 Tax disc, ethics pledge, paper ballot only, auto voter reg, indy health/mental eval drug test
who do I need to voice my concerns to? Mr. Trump & his proposed cabinet have so many ethics issues.
1/2 We need complete reform, no dirty $, no EC, laws require extreme vetting of all politicians, 5 yr
@1099rock @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP @HillaryClinton some candidates have not submitted anything to OGE. @seanspicer
please review very carefully it is vital we put the best/honest people in office
@1099rock @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump tries to rush hearings before ethics committee reviews candidates @Reince
Let's hope something actually comes of this.
@LouiseMensch @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP Is there any way to stop the hearings Sen Warren?
Liz Warren, spare  me. "Great concern" is our Country. Get over it! Trump is PRESIDENT!
and what line does trump and GOP have to cross where one should not get over it? My god your brainwashed or ignorant.
keep fighting for ethics review before confirmation hearings.
Eight years ago OGE was less than halfway thru where they are now but ... oh that's right, they're GOP.
@maddow @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP  I've emailed both of my Senators and my congressman about this.  Everyone should!
So, can the confirmation hearings be stopped, or postponed?
Hearings MUST be postponed. Billionaires with murky (and that's being overly kind) ties...c'mon man.
kEEP GOING WARREN. DIG THAT GRAVE.
WTF are they going to DO about it??
@bayshoremary @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP Pushing these ppl, to get around the system, "great concern" not enough to stop a coup
Sen. Warren, will you sign http://Change.org  petition @realDonaldTrump 2B psych eval'd y 1/19
Filibusterer until all the information is avalaible.
@dperry913 @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP letters are great. What's the action plan?
@LindaLawrey @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP GOP is un-American
so if there is "great concern" what can & will you/they do 2 hold off hearings until checks r done?
We have got to stop DT. Impeach, conflicts of interest. likes putin more than ppl in us, traitor.sick
Why didn't one senator oppose the EC vote yesterday? Americans are losing faith in the USA.
integrity & Democrats is something I thought I'd never seen in same sentence.
they MUST follow the rules..like all Americans are supposed to do. Our right to know nominees!
Hope China hacks Trump'-s tax returns. Whatever Trump is hiding will no doubt be grounds to impeach
What will be done abt this? How will the hearings be delayed until the proper paperwork is approved?
how can conf hearings begin without completed background checks.  Employees must complete!
@maddow @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP couldn't President Obama sign an Executive Order 2 delay hearings of the nominees until 1-20
Where was this concern yesterday at the Electoral College confirmation? We needed you #NotMyPresident
@maddow @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP Buncha crybabies.  Elections have consequences. #trump
@SenSchumer @SenSanders this means hit em with the hardest 1st; no time for niceties..stay firm
Please don't let this go. Someone has to have some integrity & uphold our laws. It won't be GOP.
@DebraMessing They will have to address this quickly-office w/be closed or led by Tiffany Trump on Jan 21st!
@maddow @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP What are they trying to hide? Dems MUST BE STRONG on this! Our very Republic depends on it.
@WiseWmn4Clinton @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP what can we do to ensure that our country won't be run into the ground by greed?
what is this all about? There is something very wrong here.
@CharlesMBlow @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP Do the job well. Don't cut corners, Mr. Shaub. Stay true to the work.
Stop this clown now..
MAYBE if you'd stood with 7 @HouseDemocrats to oppose EC Votes, you'd have had more time...
@HillYes1 @OfficeGovEthics @SenateGOP What are you and the other a Dems going to do about it??!! Enough with this!!
great question. Lots of reason to take action but no one is doing anything. Just talk.
what can I do to protest this crap?
We are trusting our elected leaders to ensure ALL nominees are fully vetted & will serve ALL citizens
It is very concerning that nominee announcements have been made before ethics reviews by the OGE.
This is not normal procedure. Americans deserve better.
