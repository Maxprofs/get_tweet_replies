Senator Tom Carper, Trump said he was "the law and order" of the campaign, but it's just words...
A blind trust is inadequate, as @realDonaldTrump knows the interests of his business. Full divestment only option.
ACTUALLY NO..Trump will let his kids control the Billion  $ business while Pres
The kids of @realDonaldTrump have conflicts of interest of their own. They should divest as well.
the anti-nepotism law says the children cannot serve in any capacity
Would love to see that enforced. I say that seriously. It should be.
damn straight it flippin should be!  And I say that adamantly!
@SenWarren did John Kerry and his wife divest themselves from Heinz ?
John Kerry was not Pres so what is your point
so SoS shouldn't divest themselves?
.@DonQuixte @RockABilly112 Kerry DID"divest holdings in dozens of companies in his family's vast financial portfolio"
Trump said he would so no big deal.
"trump said he would" - what a joke! "This man is a pathological liar"-Ted Cruz
Sanders,Forbes&many more have called him a pathological liar...cuz he is.http://www.forbes.com/sites/emilywillingham/2016/09/27/why-does-donald-trump-lie-so-much/#17557d536d24 …
Slimy political/publicity stunt, Tommie. DT already in the process of determining what he must do legally...& U know that!!
@SenWarren I THINK YOU A JEALOUS ISN'T TIME TO GIVE YOU SELF A RAISE
.@SenatorCarper @SenWarren WHY is This OK?

Urge is too weak a word for Trump and his swamp. Ppl better get prepared for the onslaught in coming days
They hafta tweet courteously. It helps to reduce hostile escalation. I wish trumpkins were that well-educated.
Sadly, d Dems are way too nice 4this man &his rowdy followers.May b it's time 4tit for tat.Time's running out
I agree with you but professionals gotta show courtesy.
@SenWarren Yes, because he has turned the White House into a trashy yard sale. WE THE PEOPLE ARE INCENSED AT THE CORRUPTION.
I am tired of hearing about this. if you had Clinton foundation no one would say anything. give up
@SenWarren  Well Trumps NOT heeding your ADVICE! So now WHAT???!!!
@realDonaldTrump Obama's office of Government ethics????  ROFLMAO....omg that is to funny
Government Ethics is an oxymoron.  I urge u to worry about Making America Great Again and u might save your lackluster career
So how did Obama and Hillary get so rich in office?
How was Hillary to repay the  the foreign money vested with her? Paid to play and lost,  3 times. Thank God.
How about you clean up your own house/senate first? #StopGovernmentCorruption
Did you follow Clinton and the Clinton Foundation? Have you pushed for full investigation of her criminal activity?
If you want this, then every member of Congress should divest everything. Then maybe we will have statesmen.
Say, Carpe, doesn't one of your sons work for Morgan Stanley? Guess he'll have to quit.
What a joke!!!
While Hillary got rich off of Foreign Govs while SOS & pres. candidate. HYPOCRITES
When will you urge DOJ to investigate H. Reids $2 million scam.
People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones, he's smarter than all of you put together.
where we're the board of ethics while hillary was soo crooked
pass the bill to force trump!
HE JUST MET WITH APPLE CEO. IMPEACH
#NODEMOCRATS2018.  KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK, AND YOU WILL BE A REAL MINORITY AFTER THE NEXT VOTE
@SenWarren 
So why did you not ask bush, or Obama to do this ?
@SenWarren Trump's not going to run his businesses, his kids are. That's better than Hillary's pay for play scheme!
@SenWarren Where were your balls when Hillary compromised us with her pay for play scheme with her non profit?
@SenWarren Presidential salary isn't worth what Trump would lose financially be divesting his businesses.
@SenWarren You know it would be impossible to divest all the businesses Trump owns in a timely manner. He would go bankrupt.
again.
How about you set the example Sen Warren? Or is that too much to expect from someone who lied to get her degree?
@SenWarren Ms. Warren, it would have done you better to give one to Ms. Hillary but you didn't have a vendetta against her.
NAH...NO NEED. HES GETTING RID OF ALL CORRUPTION BROUGHT IN BY THE DEMS, NOT BRINGING IT.
lol.. he won't do that.. and doesn't care what you do, he'll do what he did on revealing his taxes. wait til everyone forgets
Thank you. Please continue to hold Mr. Trump accountable for his actions. A Pres. cannot just do whatever he wants
@nutcrackermom if it involves the word ethics it may not be understood. Send it in Russian
This is critical!
Don't hold your breath waiting for *that* to happen!
@SenWarren keep pushing him by law he does not have to do anything. If I was him I wld not do any transfer just 2 piss u off.
I urge Trump to get the hell out of Washington
sad that none of your GOP colleagues are willing to put country over party and join in the call!
But he won't take anyone's advice let's force the issue u mean a President is above the law ???
@SenWarren isn't there a reservation you should be leading into bankruptcy somewhere? You know, helping your people and all?
stop urging, help your party get a spine & DEMAND action. You know dang well  the GOP would b!
@SenWarren Don't worry Trumps businesses will not be an issue.He will sit back and collect  $$$ .leaving someone else n chrge
@SenWarren You old fools should have been monitoring #crookedhillary who could be bought.trump rich enough he won't be. #MAGA
@SenWarren shut up
@GetBZLiving you can ask, or urge, but I doubt he will.
@Wendy_knows1 still haven't seen @realDonaldTrump TAX RETURNS nor any definitive answers re conflicts of interest in business
Why are you actually taking this baffoon seriously. Put all your energy into getting him out. #NotFitforPresident
thank you
@SenWarren I wonder why he is been cajoled to do the right thing? Let him be ready to face the music of disobedience!
@SenWarren ,rt
@SenWarren @SenatorCollins @SenAngusKing 

Without question!
I urge our electors to divest us of Benedict Donald.
and guess what F*&K YOU HE DIDN"T ASK your advice.
@SenWarren Trump couldn't care less about ethics....
YOU weren't urging #CrookedHillary
This is more worrying... your Aide and his radical Mosque https://creepingsharia.wordpress.com/2016/12/14/terror-experts-very-concerned-about-sen-elizabeth-warren-aide-and-his-radical-mosque … …
@SenWarren were you demanding HRC divest herself from CGI?
@SenWarren hammer him make him do it
@SenWarren
Why does it have to come to this? This person is dishonest with the American people and unfit for office.
too bad he's probably not able to due to poor business management and owing more than he's worth
Don't urge. Force it. You are dealing with a strong man. Be stronger. Right is on your side.
@SenWarren YOU SUCK! LIAR!
@SenWarren talk to the #hamiltonelectors  and convince them to vote against trump/pence!
@SenWarren # TRUMP is already rich!He's declined his paycheck while Prez and has paid his own way. Hmm..all you guys jealous?
@SenWarren , why not reducing student loan to principle & split it 4 ways, fed, bank, state, & student & let state law apply.
@SenWarren Maybe he could set up a phony charitable foundation.
LOL. Take off your fake headress. Delete your account.
As if Trump cares what you urge him to do.
Hush the grownups are in charge now Elizabeth
@SenWarren @AC360 he's had 2 yrs to wrk on transition of companies. Never intended to transfer. #GrabYourWallet #StopTheBans
Thank you, Senators! This should concern all Americans regardless of party.
@lisaemond1 I urge Traitor Trump to resign
@SenWarren we will hound him every day on this
@SenWarren thank you.
A 70-year-old man should be able to pass his legacy and biz to his children. Part of American dream.  @SenateDems. #MAGA
Trump knows more than the Office of Government Ethics. He has a really good brain. He's really smart.
@SenWarren please stop him entering the White House  too much conflict of interest corrupt fraud
Thank you, sir.
He won't.
@SenWarren Why? You take money and put it where?
#thankyou #Delawareproud
hope there is going to be more fight then being "pen pals" with trump. No offense sir but this needs more fight than letters
I guess only the Democrats are concerned since not one member of @SenateGOP signed the letter.
I urge you to get us a new election. Otherwise there is no longer even an illusion of freedom in this nation.
@SenWarren Signatures are a dime a dozen. Why should Trump divest his business holdings. Sounds like a double standard
on top of all, he acts like he's doing something magnanimous by doing something unethical. Idiot. #NoNewDealsBS
https://twitter.com/StefanMolyneux/status/808525039821799424 …
Right. Im sure he will get right on that.
*dripping in sarcasm*
All these letters do nothing!
Zilch.
Zero.
Nada.
Take action
@TeaPainUSA
@SenWarren Day late and a dollar short! DJT has already addressed this matter without your unnecessary dog and pony show.
@SenWarren Ain't gonna happen Senator. Ain't gonna happen and shouldn't
Thank you to the Gentleman from Delaware.
@SenWarren There are 8 previous Presidents that have had businesses that didn't have to sell off! Get real.
@rlockrocks @SenatorCarper @SenWarren she's a nasty women just like Hillary. Two of the same. Do as I say not as I do
@1tiffanyl @VickiMrsbi @SenatorCarper @SenWarren @rlockrocks
@1tiffanyl @VickiMrsbi @SenatorCarper @SenWarren @rlockrocks
@TeaPainUSA That should go well. Trump has to learn cursive writing first though.
I take that back. He probably thinks 'cursive' means 'Aramaic'.!
When you Senate and House Members stop making money while in office of laws you  deny or pass you can Judge
@SenWarren You should be rallying EC not to cast vote for him if he doesn't.
Good Job!
You're a mayor? Please tell me your town is just you and a donkey?
Just illustrates a skills shortage in local politics. I expected more professionalism from an official.
You're supposed to be better than that. It's disappointing.
You need to back down pal. You had your chance to fix things and didn't do anything.
Putin Installed American president could careless,you" ll knew he was a Snake and still let him in!
Why doesn't Congress take the lead on this ethics issue and pass a specific law that REQUIRES him to do so!!
@SenWarren stupid idea
Thank you for asking the P-E to divest his holdings and avoid the appearance of impropriety

@SenWarren I think not he doesn't have to and if I were him I would not do it just to drive the dems and Libs crazy
Impeach, find guilty, then kick this traitor to the curb! (2/2)
meh, DT won't care, as far as he's concerned he's in and can do what he wants (1/2)
@SenWarren I'm afraid he's playing the stall game hoping people will forget
@SenWarren pocahontas hired a known terrorist as her aid. You can't make this shit up
And yet you did. Frank Gaffney, really?
Hamza Abdelgany
@DanRodricks Trump has great ethics, the best. They're fantastic. He's so ethical he doesn't need ethics. Just ask him!
@kenobikathy   STOP begging Corrupt Liar Trump, START pressure on Electoral College to do it's DUTY & Elect Hillary-She WON
@SenWarren You're Democrats, nobody cares what you think.
@SenWarren nothing will happen.  This country lost its moral ground!
@SenWarren Well, try harder.  The guy is going to do whatever he wants and everyone is just going to talk about why he can't.
urge?
The guy hasn't (& won't) release his taxes. Do u honestly think he is going to completely divest himself from his Biz?
@SenWarren Dreamers! Do you honestly think @realDonaldTrump is going to take advice from anyone? LOL DJT is #NotMyPresident
You live in the US right? Sorry to say he is very much your president.
@SenWarren  you should urge him  to step down
@SenWarren  trump does not  care
I suggest you stop suggesting and start working for the people, not for the Alt-Left special interests.
Working for the people is exactly what they are doing.
working for the 1% you mean and the Alt-Left ?
Wow that would require a split personality. Not here dude.
he won't . get it yet? no presser bc he will NOT do it. Stop him from office NOW.
@ScoobyLady27 without seeing his tax returns how will you know?
@SenWarren ...This Is ALL Over The #Twitter Feeds!!!
@SenWarren Trump doesn't have enough $$ to divest. His whole empire is a Ponzi Scheme. Entity inside entity inside entity etc
@SenWarren FYI DT Can't Divest Or His #Ponzi Scheme/Scam Will IMPLODE! Please READ The Breaking News On This! U Tweet, ...
you guys are funny.....#goflipahouse
you aren't
I wasn't trying to be.....
ethics???why is NOBODY talking about the fact that The Donald has molested women & 13 y/o girls his whole life. Disgusting.
@SenateMajLdr Will GOP do sworn constitutional duty re: emoluments?Or R their oaths empty 2?No shame at long last?
@TeaPainUSA Thank you, Senator. Thank you.
@SenWarren  whole Dem party r hypocrites
another GOP phony posting. Where do they get the pictures and do they think no one notices?
Ha Ha.  Autocrats take advice from no one!
time to get this moving bc he thinks he can do what he want and has to be stopped time for manchild to grow up
Come now, u must know this isn't going to happen! Trump has shown NO indication that he will take the role of POTUS seriously
@SenWarren  Please Sen Carper, give & urge colleagues to give Trumps picks all the scrutiny they deserve. Scary!
@SenWarren Need more than just this. He has had at least 18 months and hasn't done it yet. Hasn't even released his tax info
Awww you think he listens to something other that the voices in his head... How cute...

#DonTheCon
#JustImpeachHimNow
@SenWarren @SenatorCarper like that will happen. He keeps promising, never delivers and people believe him.
.@SenatorCarper @SenWarren Same likelihood as imploring Big Foot to show his face.
you must not have been watching Trump's campaign.
please list the lies. Also list those told by Trump.
I think there is a 'group' possibly paid,to post here to deflect, obscure and obstruct clear view.
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump makes perfect sense I think.  What do you think?  @TeaPainUSA
Tea kissed it!
@SenWarren Terrorists probably planning right now which one to blow up first, any/all Trump holdings at risk.
He and family would have a few billion, not to mention the hundreds or thousands of lives NOT LOST.
after attack Trump will use as excuse 2 invade,war is on. Guess u like death,destruction.
An urging. This is pathetic. Thanks for the usual nothing, Dems.
.@SenatorCarper @SenWarren DEMS GRANDSTANDING**WHERE WERE THEY WHEN HILLARY WAS PAY-FOR-PLAYING AT STATE???  HYPOCRISY OF THE LIBERALS!!!
Deflection will no longer work.  Trump is the issue.
.@jane4rd @SenatorCarper @SenWarren Good luck with that but you may want to get out of the way
.That sounds like a threat.
Thank you Senators
Considering he always does what is in his own interest, I think we know the answer to that.
like the message but sadly, it's too late to save us from Chancellor Trump, maybe in 4 years, if we make it
Hopefully, he will have enriched himself enough to leave us alone
He will never do it. He is balls deep into a power grab and nothing will deter this moron.
He is going to wait until after the electoral. Then he is going to say he is not going to do it.
@CommonCause BUT NOT TO HIS CHILDREN. INDEPENDENT TRUST IS THE ONLY/LEGAL WAY.
So true, but he'll dig his heels in.
We're going to need action way beyond a letter.... the guy ignores security briefings... you think he cares about a letter?
Where are other #Senators on this? @alfranken @amyklobuchar I'd like to see them making similar statements.
meanwhile congressman Sam Johnson a Republican from TX has introduced bill raising the retirement age/slash benefits.
In a couple of years, we're going to look back and say "Remember when we had an Office of Government Ethics?"
YES....remember acting ethically in office was expected, or you got shit canned?
