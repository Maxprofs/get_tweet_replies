.@SenWarren Thank you for speaking out against this. You've just saved me a call to your office about it tomorrow ;)
YUP. Now both our senators (and my rep) have condemned this. GOOD.
I hope so. I was impressed with NYC's willingness to shred records if they had to.

I am not classy, I keep it real. class has to do with trying to say something nice all the time
It also keeps you from unloading your emotions on strangers.
I dont take meds. I try to NOT be like every other druggie in this country thanks
Bless your heart. Untreated mental illness may be causing your emotional outbursts.
thanks for the thoughts guys./gals. I voted for you Donald. remember that.
Your such a bigoted person Elizabeth
it is not bigoted to point out a bigot. A bigot bigots according to race/orientation. What's her basis?
You should look up the definition of a bigot
I don't have to. I live around enough of them. You fit the definition.
a person who is intolerant toward those holding different opinions. Apparently your the bigot.
y are you still harping? Be a professional & hope for the best & support your president like GOP did for Obama

He is a President for all.... but you Liz! Congrats @realDonaldTrump i havent laughed that hard AT a politician since “cause you’d be in jail.”  Choo-choo baby!
@MDBlanchfield @realDonaldTrump because he is a russian agent and if his coup is allowed to continue america is dead jan 20
You lost your once considerable credibility among the PEOPLE when you pimped for Hillary &Wall Street. RETIRE!!!
Why do democrats praise former KKK leader Senator Robert Byrd as a paragon of virtue?
Hmmm.
You lost Liz. You ran a terrible candidate and got crushed. If Trump is so bad, what does it say that he won?
It says many got conned! Don the Con
It worse than that, His kids want top secret clearance? shut that down, Where is the electoral college now?
So where did Killarys MAID get a Top Secret Clearance from?? She printed lots of our Class Info!
.@elizabethforma @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump-To fend off politicians like u. Why did u back @HillaryClinton who profited from Wall St? #MAGA
@JackieSabulsky @realDonaldTrump Everyone means EVERYONE
Stop tweeting @SenWarren & get to work! Or, WE WILL REMEMBER!
AGREED!!! @SenWarren hasn't said a word about the theft of Hillary's election, and she's hanging out with Sanders again.
Indeed! She's not acting all that NASTY now, and WE WILL REMEMBER
Easy...We went so far left for a long time, time to come right a little to bring to Center!
embracing how? He is not and you know he isn't. Soros is behind all the "ugliness"
@_juliannemoore @realDonaldTrump why r we more divided now than ever?Maybe the current administration had something to do w/ it?
Can't wait to see a clip of you having to call him Mr President! Don't forget to switch to "@potus" in 60 days 
Obama said the same thing and ignored or punished half of us thereby creating Pres Trump. Way to go
Go finish drying up. You are an embarrassment to women everywhere.
Obama has been the divider.  How has Trump embraced ugly?  He hasn't embraced you has he?
BECAUSE Hillary and u r still arounf
the dems are the ones showing their true bigoted violence because they lost & will not getWH again as a result
@KingKing3107 @realDonaldTrump he lies he lies he lies

If you want to be included Liszt, jump on the Trump train
Trump has far exceeded his predecessors in assembling a transition team. Close mouth, Ms. Do-Nothing senator.
LYING FAKE INDAIN OBAMA HAS DEVIDE THE COUNTRY AND YOUR TERM IS SOON TO EXPIRE SO YOU AHTE US AND TRUMP
Maybe he wanted you to feel more comfortable with his administration

That's  already  has happened , it happened  under Obama . Get facts  right.
Your party was just as bad or even worse. Stop the hypocritical comments, Sen. Warren.
you and the DNC trolls are the ones who divided and still dividing this country stop drinking lady!
PLEASE do something about Russia hacking our votes!
#AuditTheVote @KamalaHarris @SenatorReid @dickdurbin @SenSchumer @PattyMurray
Trump never wanted to be president. He just wanted to win and have people adore him Tell him to speak not tweet
Trump never intended to have any plan. His only plan was to win, at all costs. He duped the GOP while endangering US
Join @LindseyGrahamSC in calling for hearings into the Russian cyberattacks. Follow the money. #TrumpTaxReturns
@Solutioneer72 behind you Elizabeth! Keep up the battle!
It would help if you lefties stopped using the media to lie about @realDonaldTrump with your "white nationalist" garbage.
see the James OKeefe videos and see who's campaign was being decisive and crooked. Sore looser!!!
worry about cleaning up your own house 1st! Getting SorosRiots OUT!
u r the problem! DT has met w/Dems! He wants to bring ppl together u & #SorosRiots continue to divide! used to vote Dem but NEVER
You need serious help.  Has Soros sent you a check lately?
You mean the DNC funded protesters? #hypocrisy #TrumpWon
You're confused. That was Hillary.
So perfect!
you think OBAMA or Hillary was president for all? LMAO..my insurance for my family of 5 went up 400 bucks

@CFraase @realDonaldTrump Trump meant the president of all Deplorables, no one else.
Why are progressive liberals against & scaring to death 50% of the country?
u have some nerve.u pretended u r for people but u bent over backward to the bloodsucking monster. get lost
There was and still is ugliness from your side @SenWarren, beginning with you and all the bought protesters!

@PMorris153 @realDonaldTrump Tell us Liz why the hell aren't you the Minority Leader instead of that Wall St shill Chuck?

@temasls @realDonaldTrump I never heard him say all.
Someone tell @SenWarren aka #Pocahontas to go get LOST.  @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence @Reince #cnn #OANN #foxnews #TheFive #NYTimes
yes, Obama and Clinton now ripping each other. Fun to watch liberals turn on each other. Divisive
Stop the riots Sen Warren
Seems like Dems are lacking any moral compass or integrity or ethics. .time to clean house Warren
whatever, just get out of the way, flicking criminal dems, and cheaters trying to rig the system. Just shut up
Steve Bannon a Veteran Military Officer, daughter just graduated from West Point, he's a Christian Conservative
Steve Bannon is a professional with as much education, experience that one could want in their administration
we could say same for u. Why are u embracing the destruction of property and violence against those who voted trump. U Demon.
He's a liar
All talk Warren! 90% of racism and non inclusive rhetoric is on the left.
I love you Sen. Warren
we are going to keep the pressure on you Donald we aren't going away
I cant believe she was elected maybe selected
let his term start
At SenWarren why are you meeting with Nazi Sympathizer&AntiAmericanGeorge Soros TRADER
@AnastasiaSomoza @realDonaldTrump
"A conscious effort by a nation-state to attempt to achieve a specific effect" NSA chief on WikiLeaks http://on.wsj.com/2geEat1  #WSJCEOCouncil 
You told the truth about @hillaryclinton being a war-mongering psychopath. What changed your mind? Money or Power or Both?
Please tell us little people how @realDonaldTrump embraces ugliness & divisiveness? We are waiting
Why do you meet with Nazi @georgesoros to try to divide & overthrow our country? What's in it for you?
@Bernie_Facts @realDonaldTrump tell us Elizabeth, you called yourself progressive. Why did you endorse  warmonger fracker Hillary
tell us Elizabeth how gracious the Dems were after they lost & how well they took that before you criticise any1
-/ You are mentally ill.
@carriekline go Elizabeth Warren!
Well said, Senator! I salute you!
Methinks that .@realDonaldTrump was lying again when he said that.
because he's a con and Putin's patsy
watch the 60 minutes interview. Maybe you will learn something.  #fakeindian #closedmind
if collusion/treason bet.Trump &Putin is proven, will the election results be null & Hillary, winner of popular vote, president?
why are the liberals Rioting and Obama is silent?
it is what got him elected. u brought Krispy Kremes to the 2nd roast & support Libya Lady. do understand 'base'?
It's beautiful that Mr.Trump is not a lying, cheating, corrupt, user of the people, traitor like @HillaryClinton
Shut up Goofy Elizabeth.
Thanks for continuing to prove you are not the "Senator for all". Looking forward to 2018.
he won and gets to hire who he wants! You're opinion is irrelevant!!
Senator Warren trump has always been a liar
You calling Bannon a bigot is a joke. Casting the first stone
Why do you display such an extreme level of misandry.
Liz... What exactly have you done in the Senate? What bills have you passed? Why does anyone listen to you?
Why don't you go back to your hole. You saw what I people thought of your put down of our President elect.
You said it profoundly with truth
TELL US WHAY WE WANT TO HEAR.
Let the man govern.Stop all your divisiveness and ugliness, Liz. Don't be mad.
Looks like @SenWarren didn't get the American people's message that name-calling isn't a winning strategy.
looking forward to the day you'll be wearing black & white stripes picking up trash on the side of the road
Thank you for standing up  and upholding the idea of a non bias government that makes USA stay free and great for all people!
because the leader of this country are so afraid to speak up!
"I say things, okay? I say A LOT OF THINGS!"
Thanks Senator, you are appreciated.
Why are you enticing kids to riot? Can we consider that divisiveness as well?
Because he's a *liar!*
Call out the Anti-Trump protesting liberals for what they are.. then you can make your case..
the people want a conflict of interest investigation!  No tax returns, shady deals! And the swamp is looking BAD
I am still waiting for the tax returns! He just keeps changing his tune
Great f'n question. #TheResistance
can this bitch change her name?
President for All? Trump is a con man-You can't believe anything he says. He just wants to get over
. We are not a part of all.
Thank you Senator Warren.  I have some comfort knowing you and Senator Sanders are on the hill.
Where's Hope and change for ALL Americans during Obama's 8 years? Where's the inclusive msg for Trump supporters
Maybe somebody isnt telling truth.
He's like a deer in a headlight.  Totally without substance and clarity to what this really means.  #NeverPence
Because he's unable to do anything without his children or anyone else tell him what to do.  Possible Alzhiemer?
he NEEDS his children to help him because he can't make any decision without them.  Pathetic and puny man
Worst part is that FACTS get lost on facebook & twitter repeats the idiocy unchecked. No facts for Americans
@ManMet80 @realDonaldTrump He meant "For all time."
Elections have consequences. Crooked media
.@SenWarren more importantly why are you pretending that's not exactly what people voted for? This is not the time for make believe. #racism
This is the " for all" that Trump was referring to.
and this too
Didn't you align w Clinton campaign? Isn't calling people deplorable racists etc. divisive?typical left.
DUH.  HE LIED.   It's what he does.  

We're fucked, my senator.  We're FUCKED.  It's all serfs and lords now.
that would be the hired hit men of hillary starting all these protests, shut the hell up, @realDonaldTrump won
just got a nasty response from Kelly Conway. Not acceptable. We all need to feel safe and comfortable!!!
You are confusing the Rodham campaign with the Trump campaign.
U should try find a real job,u cant make money any other way but being a career politician-typical left, useless
Unfortunately he is what we said he is all along. A racist, misogynist, bigot..
Warren, what about your demonstraters, you know, the ones destroying property and dragging citizens from cars
Lying Lizabeth....u Soros monkey.  Just cuz you say it doesn't make it truth
Please stay on it Senator Warren.  We need your voice now more than ever.
BECAUSE HE IS FOR ALL NOT LEFTS NOT RIGHTS... LOOK IN MIRROR
We have heard enough of this crazy woman. Cut all funds to her State if she don't shut up
Today in Ask A Silly Question: @SenWarren wonders why @realDonaldTrump is doing what he said he would.
Tell us, @realDonaldTrump: You said you'd be a "President for all." Then why are you embracing the ugliness & divisiveness of your campaign?
Painful to watch.
@arembooks @realDonaldTrump
You are characterizing this as divisive to promote your own agenda. Sad.  American's not fooled by your antics.
Did the Ugly and Divisive George Soros pay you to say that? @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
What are you... 5 yrs old?
I'm starting to think tweets like this are just echoes. You need a more general channel than an echo chamber.
Because he was just trying to convince stupid, angry, hateful people to make him president. It worked.
We aren't you speaking out against the ugliness and divisiveness of the violent liberals rioting?
@frankhowell7911 @realDonaldTrump Exactly. Tax cuts for the very wealthy. Racists in top positions. Questionable role of family.
Speaking as a Queer person, what did you expect from a man with Pence as his Veep?
@You "can't stand the rain" can you? I don't expect you to know who sang this song....hint: a person of color.
again you should have run.
@MiaFarrow @realDonaldTrump what are you even talking about? Seriously?
@Anomaly100 @realDonaldTrump 

How many Pocahontas tweets will you get for telling the truth?

I stand with Elizabeth Warren.
Why are you Embracing George Soros Warren? Those back room deals, then you get caught lying again and again.
zzzz zzzz zzzz
3.1: so u @SenWarren better #ShutUpAndDance w/ President @realDonaldTrump or better packed ur lamey aXX & go 2 syria! @MiaFarrow
3.2: u r perfect 2 become the queen of #goats cause u've been MBAAAAAAAAing like them: yEp! @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @MiaFarrow
Yes, let's talk about Ugliness. The Liberal Riots have now taken a life. #tuesdaymotivation
INDIAN FRAUDSTER 
Surely, Elizabeth, Donald Trump can only embrace ugliness and divisiveness. It is all he knows.
tellem lizzy love you bunches
He is NOT POTUS yet!! Why are you harranging him like he is? Protests, riots? Start them on Jan 22!!
Liawatha your relevance left many moon ago
DNC rioters. We know youre crooks #strawdonor
Sen Warren get over yourself. Look at the US, it is way more Center Right than Progressive Secular
He showed us who he is. A tiger can't change his stripes. A person so flawed should not be President
For @realDonaldTrump words are mere rhetoric designed to alienate or appease based on agenda.
and just what role are you filling !
POCAHONTAS this is why you will continue losing 2the Republicans! WE are the party of ideas& solutions!
You? False accusations!
