do you even know the definition of assault rifle?
@BostonGlobe define "assault weapons "
you could look it up yourself but http://goal.org/masslawpages/awfacts.html …
I know what the definition is...obviously a lot on the left do not.
well you asked this is MA defintion so your point is?
#JillNotHill #Demexit #BernieOrGreen #TrumpTrain #NeverHillary #MAGA @realDonaldTrump
The ruling class loves it. The people, and are State Constitution: not so much.
I think this is why you may be called Massholes
and all the rational thinking, common sense conservative Americans support banning YOU!
Too bad you didn't support honest elections.  Cost you your reputation, was it worth it? #JillNotHill #DemExit #HillNO
what's an assault weapon ?
@BostonGlobe and taking people's constitutional rights from them without due process, good job liberal dirtbag
You and Healy keep your hands off our guns!  I shutter thinking of what you would do to our second amendment rights!
SHUT UP FAUXCAHONTES
@SenWarren @MassAGO
Love to see all those who think gun control laws work walk the streets of Chicago for 1 night
@scribeofsolomon @SenWarren @MassAGO
Thank you. Proud to be from MA.
And that's a damn lie!  Not ALL of them supports this crap and you know it.  Who are you trying to kid?  Hands off!
Good for you what % of murders in MA where rifles used!?
Ban truck and knives while you're at it.
You're both completely ignorant. These "solutions" are nothing more than a hinderance on law-abiding civilians.
just a bunch of Leftist Marxist morons
you're off your rocker.
what 
and we will see the entire MA delegation replaced.
its all just political bullshit !!
lawless and clueless to the one. Since I can own one of these, but not buy one, please show me the law that says so?
Thanks for letting us know exactly who to vote out next term.
your not enforcing law You're making your own 2A is equally as important as the 1st. Respect the constitution.
@BostonGlobe if you don't understand the 2A, please get out of your office. You  shouldn't served the peoples n Ma.
What do the people support? Just another photo op @GOALupdate
put it to vote then!
YOU ADVANCE ONLY LAWLESSNESS
@BostonGlobe who really runs the NRA?
@BostonGlobe no surprise there, thanks for protecting my rights. I hope this backfires on all of you come election day.

@BostonGlobe Leave gun laws alone!
@BostonGlobe @GOALupdate Want to make our communities safer? Ban heroin..... oh wait...
She has offered no clarity, the law changes on her whim, you'll find out that a firearm is illegal when they charge you
the "definition" of an assault weapon is whatever Maura Healey feels  like it means.
anybody who supports this illegal action or even looks the other way deserves to be voted right out of office.
You violate the constitution and trample on the rights of law abiding citizens. Gun owners vote.
ur WRONG try focusing on the criminals not law abiding citizens!!!  No one voted EW!!!
@SenWarren @MassAGO
.@SenWarren @MassAGO One reason I dont live there. Just b/c you freedom-taking intellectuals think it's right. https://youtu.be/P4zE0K22zH8 
@BostonGlobe what do you expect of a commi democraper.
Too bad the useless GOP congress won't do the same thing. They just stuff their pockets with gun lobby dough.
DISAPPEAR! http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/elizabeth-warren-donald-trump-disappear-226334 …
are you planning on having another "sit-in" to show your stance on our #secondamendment? #crybabysenator
this is horrible.. Not banning assault weapons but changing the definition to include rifles as assault rifles.
I'd hate to enforce that law if I had to abide by it.
the HiklsazHillary believes in Satan,not God?
@BostonGlobe from my cold, dead, hands.  Blow smoke signals up someone else's backside.
@BostonGlobe but your voting constituents do not
Massachusetts #PhonyGovernment State & Fed ask #Hines aka @SenWarren @craftyguy2 @MassAGO & #PhonyCourts for class above rest #Racketeering
people like you make me ashamed to live in mass. You are the biggest hypocrite out there!!!
"If I can't have a folding stock then I guess I won't murder those people" - said by no one ever
@BostonGlobe Why are you giving military equipment to Saudi Arabia for sale?
@BostonGlobe MaryJane users used weapons.
..lead on Senator!
@lildg54 @MassAGO @BostonGlobe 

BAN ALL  !!!!!!
Slow down on assault weapons Liz. I luv u, but this is a useless move. Ban the wackos, not AWs.
is a millionaire demonizing millionaires towing party lines everyday of the week. #Pantsuit #hypocrisy
oh ya, take our guns away so we cannot protect ourselves from the corrupt government and thugs. Just the way u want it
My home state impresses me beyond all other states. Kudos to everyone 
ITS TIME  !!!!!! .
that's because you all violate the #Constitution on a regular basis. Try keeping your Oath for a while.
thank you for doing the right thing to help protect us all.
@BostonGlobe let's get the whole country behind this
@BostonGlobe Does the ban prohibit ownership or does it mean these weapons simply can't be purchased within MA?
that's why all of you need to be removed from office
the bill of rights protects the state militia's right to muskets. Not ordinary people's right to assault weapons.
@BostonGlobe How about banning Clintons from government?
@BostonGlobe Good move.
@SDCGO2A 
Even a fake Indian should know it’s not wise to keep poking the bear. Just sayin

#DNCleak 
#SethRich
@Bradybuzz @MassAGO or if the state congress wants this why not amend the ban and make it legitimate law?
@Bradybuzz @MassAGO why stop there? If you're making up laws why not ban guns completely?
@BostonGlobe Ass dick Republicans won't vote against cash cow donors. Despite 97% Americans favor some reform.
I am sure that the Criminal culture supports this idea fully Make sure the good people have less chance of life You Fool
The 2nd amendment is their to protect us from a criminal gov or do you believe they are Gods they are never wrong
yeah... "We aren't coming for your guns!" about that
haha, I thought it said Hillary's leadership for a minute there.
I support you on everything, except this.
of course you do, b/c it's an overreach of legal authority, vague in substance. Law abiding gun owning constits disagree
the first recorded weapon of assault was a rock, u gonna ban rocks too?
try taking our guns.
- This is like abortion. Strategically, you go for birth control first - you know - "stay out of my bedroom", etc.
Sad day, our rights have to be infringed. Go after guns owned illegally or is that too much to ask
@BostonGlobe Deception: lawlessness championed by Corrupt on display. Lynch denied request of FBI2investigate corruption
@BostonGlobe Banning them from LE also? No? Nothing to see here... #PoliceState
Clowns all.....
I guess you have no vocabulary either.
What next? huh banning guns....that would go to the black markets if that happens.
@BostonGlobe You can't touch the 2A witch
so she's an Indian giver?
@BostonGlobe illegal,  a AG does not get to make laws.
I STIL cannot see why people are making rocket science over such sensible regulations !   WTF am I missing
Perhaps you should care a bit about opiate overdoses.  In Colorado, this rate went down when MMJ was legalized.
who the fuck falls for this anyway?
