Sen. Markey writes to Comcast about possible loss of NBC signal for customers http://whdh.com/news/sen-markey-writes-to-comcast-about-possible-loss-of-nbc-signal-for-customers … via @7News
@7News so would you be as concerned if FOX had a signal loss?
My question is still relevant as these people have NO concern other than for everyday people to see biased TV channels!
that's fine! If I didn't LIKE IT , then I would not WRITE It!
@7News Wonderful free antenna TV can be tricky; you have to adjust for it/free advice http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/sks/5904644923.html …
You can't indoctrinate the ignorant masses without the support of your liberal accomplice at NBC. #USUCK
we can't get any local channels unless we pay for a box frm Comcast in Wash where I live. 65 trying to retire they wouldn't help
Why so SILENT about #DAPL ? R u not of Indian heritage? I'm quite taken back by this.
thought Comcast replacing with ch 10?
I am a disable widow! ! I live in Rual NY. I depend on free TV !!
Would you waste your time if it were @FoxNews ?
@7News Do you have any idea how happy I am to have Markey as a Senator?
@7News #nodapl make it happen

@7News Comcast isn't free. An antenna is free. Still going  to be there right?
Why arent you investigating the porn that cnn aired for a full 30 minutes? I dont hear you spewing on that
Nobody watches broadcast TV anymore. It's filled with liberal bias. R.I.P. fake media
@7News GO BACK TO THE RESERVATION POCAHONTAS!
we are losing our democracy. Please do something.
@7News  Beginning to get really concerned that mainstream media/news is now accelerating to its end
@7News do what you do best in MA give subsidies, or get XFinity yes available in MA
the poetical loss of the nbc signal has been in the news for months. Why is thus just being discussed now?
@7News SolarFlare* 
@7News get DISHnetwork and get COMCAST out.
Fauxcahontis,It's MSM anyway. Who want to see the biased news. Tell them to watch ABC or CBS on free air.
I agree with u They should have dropped CNN We all know how u feel about CNN n u r right They r scum
@7News You could just actually call them.
fight Comcast and replace it with @google fiber. Faster,  more reliable,  better in every way.
@7News - it's starting, suppressing the media, if we look you will find Trump behind it.
@7News taking over the media is the first step and that happened long ago!
Not sure what the issue is, since. Comcast owns NBC it seems strange. Comcast, the company we love to hate
@7News First lesson of economics. There is no such thing as free. It's just stuff paid for by others.
Good God! The American people are not paying you to worry about cable TV outages! Do something to justify your ridiculous salary!
@7News Elizabeth please. Cant you Team with Bernie and quit stalling? We need a United Front
@7News I fear I will soon be in this situation
Comcast answers to nobody.
It must be a vast right wing conspiracy!  Bwahahahaha!
@7News :and a fools lips shall swallow her up!
Always wanting something for free, even fake news
@7News they shouldn't count on it. It isn't free to produce it shouldn't be free to consume
@7News Lol. Can't you just Nationalize the industry and run it yourself? Didnt that work for healthcare?
Fwd: http://gofundme.com/electoral-college-to-stop-trump …
I'm not sure that is a loss to the public.  They have a lot of explaining to do about the news coverage.
Racist!!
creeping Fascist Propaganda targets the heart of Progressive politics!
the can get their NBC free just not on PAID cable service @SenMarkey @comcast @7News
No big loss as far as I'm concerned.  Buh bye, Matt Lauer #LaueringTheBar
@7News 
If you had Supported @BernieSanders the Senate, House & EPA wouldn't be in the ENEMIES hands!
BadGirl
@7News micro manage much? How about the fraud u committed to steal a scholarship from the Cherokee?
@7News thank you. I am not a cable user and I can't believe this has happened in Boston.
@7News I think it's great that fake news is being removed from the cable lineup.
you haven't got any idea what you're talking about.
@7News Thank you Warren. Need broadcast networks to stay broadcast networks.
@7News this is a great start at putting an end to fake news
@7News Monopolies get 2 do this...that's why they do....
reflects communists countries..govt,run &controlled  by wealthiest exclude poor= collateral fallout
Defense Depart/police uses same term 2 defend continuously kill innocent ppl while persuing a target
Important to remember people that rely on free TV ,see mostly conservative news& religious broadcasting
good I hope abc nbc msnbc Cnn other fake news channels go off the air,people are sick of there bullshit news
add foxnews to that list
Who needs corporate mainstream media when you have actual journalism with @TYTNetwork http://tytnetwork.com/join 
@7News Cable greed continuing to rip off customers
@7News Wow, from Dodd-Frank to demanding answers about a loss of TV signal. How the mighty have fallen.
how do people rely on TV?
@7News  where were you when ObamaTook 500mil frmMedicare 2 pay 4 a failed Obamacare @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls
The answer is making the internet a public utility! Web has become to important to be controlled by corps.
@7News the same is in Maine but @SenatorCollins does NOTHING about it. @TimeWarnerJobs is a JOKE #criminals
Comcast (Comcrap) is the worst! Our wonderful government let this merger happen with NBC now they could care less !!
@7News if it were fox news signal then we should b concerned. since  Nbc,We s/bhappy @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls
Where are those new TV top type boxes that allow anyone to provide programming as approved by the FCC?
If the Fox signal was lost, we wouldn't hear a peep from either of you.
This is very curious, indeed, as NBC is owned by Comcast, a cable TV provider not at all popular with customers.
@7News TV is obsolete- move forward with tech resources, tech jobs, discernment to filter. Pick your battles.
I wonder if you would apply the same level of vigor if it was a Fox Station on the blink?
ugh...that is cable and paid for so your point is what??? She said 'free' broadcasting
Fox is also terrestrial.  Get your facts straight before sounding off
hah!  I am sure she would be just a mad for free broadcast just not paid false advertisement
Question is, why are public, FCC licensenced, public stations holding cable companies and viewers ransom?
@GeorgeWill @GStephanopoulos are enjoying F @MarthaRaddatz ! #transition #Tatiana
Hey George(S) who is first in line to F Martha?
Not to worry. it's ok. Right Side Broadcast Network is coming soon. Motto: Full Spectrum Disinformation.
.@SenWarren @SenMarkey @comcast LEAVE IT ALONE...NO LOSS
