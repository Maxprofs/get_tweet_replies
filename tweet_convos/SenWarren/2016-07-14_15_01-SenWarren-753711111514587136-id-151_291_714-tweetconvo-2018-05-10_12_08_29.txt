Do you have a comment on the tweet topic?
Thank you. Sorry if my first tweet seemed anything other than inquiry.
Please see my pinned tweet! We are going to TERMINATE the fraud scam @CFPB that targets Black & Veterans. End it!
Exactly. Democrats must ban the Republican owned frame "regulation" & replace it w/the Progressive frame "Protection"
.@dacullington,I spoke to u two years ago con. Ocwen trying to foreclose.  Ms. Boxer did 0, Gov. Brown and CFPB did 0, WTD?
disgusting officials do NOTHING to help us w/these criminals guess #Ocwen is paying them off #RICO @POTUS
Another bloated gov. program like energy department.
looking out for yourself is not communism. just ask the corporatados.
@SenWarren @CFPB
@SenWarren @CFPB
I commend you for CFPB; it is your signature accomplishment.  But @realDonaldTrump really will win, not Crooked Hillary.
Hillary has stolen?
You said a couple of years ago, Hillary will say what Americans want to hear to be elected. How much money did you say
@SenWarren @CFPB
that is just bullshit
wow, 100's of govt programs trudge along and it took 'til NOW to find one that can prove it's useful … #WeakSauce
@SenWarren @CFPB
Show it by resigning.
actually you guys, made it worse.  Just like health-care
no it's not, it's destroying Amerika
your all kinds of crazy !
@SenWarren @CFPB
You lost credibility the day you chose crooked hiliary over Bernie. Shame on u 4 being a coward.
Do you know any Liars?
Do you know the 2 people running for POTUS?
Yep, you know at least " 2 Huge Liars. "
CFPB is a disaster. No oversight. they write their own checks.
@SenWarren @CFPB
Why didn't BHM give this job to you?
Hillary made tens of millions from WallStreet while they foreclosed on millions of homes
First degree rape of 12 year old girl Watch story of how Hillary happily sets guilty man free
yeah works great for employees. Non managers make over $200k per year
.@SenWarren @timmbarton123 And Trump, other right wingers & hedge fund mgrs HATE the @CFPB. Just like bank robbers hate cops.
YOU'RE A JOKE! TOTAL LIAR!

20 Trillion in debt. Great job.
I think i have indian in me what can i get.
seems natural that one woman that would lie and take advantage of minorities would support someone who lies to minorities.
I hope this is for real. It is great if you really did this to help everyone than it is appreciated. @CFPB
@SenWarren @CFPB
@SenWarren @CFPB
Liz, spinning lies is obvious on your face. Take a break!
what an f'g witch!
You tweet more than Donald!
@HillaryClinton Trump touts that he represents a "movement." Couldn't think of a more appropriate use for a "TP" ticket...
you blister, u talk about weak? U had gov patrick answer for u at Pocahontas  gate #warrentheliar #crookedHillary
Welcome to the real world! Gird your overgrown loins.As HRC's new "insulted-in-chief" expect I pretty things to emerge about you.
woo woo woo. What am I doing?? Woo woo woo
I see u deleted your tweet that called a Gov Pence insecure after u found out he was a US Marine
Why isn't anyone talking about Trumps sons killing spree in Africa...They killed an elephant and a leapord for fun...
@SenWarren @CFPB
.. you live in a $5.4 mil. home & have the nerve to act a warrior for the lil people..multi-level fraud.
you should go back to the Indian Reservation and leave us alone
@SenWarren @CFPB
"Bull schtye".  Lawyers, lenders and realtors despise the CFPB except that it has increased costs for  consumers. 
your a joke
Of course with Trump & Pence taking over in November they will straighten out the Obama mess & take ISIS OUT!
I cannot think of one government program where the government does ANYTHING better than the private sector.  Not one.
Goofy Elizabeth Warren
your wrong they don't help, I guess you never had to use their services like I did
Govt hasn't worked for the people since 2008. Govt proved that many times! They are for THEMSELVES 1st, the people 2nd!
. You are the #1 goofyest individual this country will ever know there Pocahontas. Anyone that listens 2U is brainless.
@SenWarren @CFPB
U r not in touch with middle class Amer. no more than HC is!
thanks for sharing Elizabeth, have a great Friday :) (Want this ? >> http://bit.ly/tweet_thanks_ )

better than nothing!
U lied, you are not Native American.  #Hillary and you should go to a compulsive liars help group. You need it bad. #liar
Economy always does better with a Democratic President.
Hopefully the PHH case doesn't upset the structure on constitutional grounds.
@SenWarren @CFPB
@SenWarren @CFPB
On the warpath again?
government has NEVER been able to run any program efficiently or without corruption
no tweets on the attack in Nice? Can't blame guns or hate so your quiet? I know, let's blame trucks and call for a ban on them.
Looks like you had to look pretty hard for some "proof"
sen Warren.  You are pitiful!! Go back yr multi $$million mansion and your Mercedes and your boondoggle at Harvard.
hey, Pochacuntus! Look to the sky! Read the smoke signals from France! Maybe we should worry about that
you've never been able to get a private sector job in your entire life. Why would anyone care what you say?
old Harry Potter
the CFPB is one of the best things to come out of Congress in years! Thank you!
"...government works FOR the people..." there I fixed it for you. Remember who you answer to.
pocahontas
that's not true you but they have answered me in anyway I have called and written you many many times !!
when are you and hill gonna release your scissoring video?
CFPB is last line of defense for consumers!
The biggest Mafia organization out of a bad bill..Dodd Frank. GOP will outlaw them for good reason.
@DanScavino give it a break fubar
The agency that reports neither to congress or President. That's not what USA about. They extort to stop access to lending.
After they extort money it doesn't go to people deserve it...goes to progressive activists. Socialism Won't help it hurts
I love that you are always fighting the good fight.
make sure to tune into @WCVB for The Boston Foundation's  co-hosted town hall about #RaceinBoston at 9pm after @POTUS
We must make absolutely sure nominations to Supreme Court are rational!!!
VP-Sanders is the only way we can mobilize all support!
. @SenWarren @CFPB And the #GOP 's resistance to it proves they hate people not in the 1%!
you know this agency doesn't give money won to the people but activists
. @winojanet @SenWarren @CFPB You've had too much wine to be coherent, Janet. Bye Felicia!
When Ms Warren speaks…one can’t have too much wine.
@SenWarren @CFPB
Thanks. For the billions of ways the gov't negatively infiltrates our lives, you find perhaps ONE positive example? Wow.
Then why wasn't Hillary indicted?? Corrupt government failure...
Have you run away from press questions again lately, @SenWarren?  What are you afraid of?
it got me a great settlement with my student loan company.
Someone paid for you...taxpayers. wouldn't brag that promised to pay then reneged. Your credit suffers
your an idiot. Tax payers like myself who actually pay my student loan payments every month were being overcharged interest.
Overcharged…did you get the rate lowered? Then I get it…but if you had principle chg off..that is not good.
you have no idea what your talking about. The company was charging to much interest. Thus they were defrauding customers.
As a banker…your original document would state the rate after graduation or leaving school. So maybe didn’t read?
you can keep trying to make me look stupid but I did read. That is why they ended up under investigation. I kept reporting.
So did you readjust the interest rate?
Thank you @SenWarren for @CFPB. I wish you were running the joint... or running for VP.

I love you senator
THEN WHY DIDN'T HELP US STOP THE BANKSTERS?
You should be our nominee. We'd take back both the House and Senate.
1 cylinder firing in a 16 cylinder engine doesn't make for much of a ride.
Keep it going Liz. @senwarren @cfpb
