Poor POCAHONTAS. Still so distraught.
solid rebuttal by a hardcore Trump fan.  Still have that #draintheswamp t-shirt?  It's funnier now
Swamp is drained as soon as Hussein O leaves. Ethics problems end with that communist.
call the outgoing prez a communist while your boy pals around with the Kremlin?  That's rich
didn't @HillaryClinton broker the deal to sell them our uranium for contributions
maybe I'm a bit confused.  Isn't Trump PEOTUS?  Why talk about HRC?
your referral to his boy brought a comment referring to your girl that had real contact
lol she ain't nothing to me but nice try. Don't assume pointing out his flaws means I like her
.@SenWarren @HouseGOP buncha indian givers ammirite Pocahontas?
you're not a good person. I feel sorry for you.
yeah ur leading alright right into that Swamp 
so instead of draining its include and add to the swamp, from walls to fences y'all doing it

yeah as you now worship your billionaire prez that sold you bs on how hes for the working man #gullible

Bitmoji's and memes. Trumpers are simple folk.
must hurt to lose and worship a fraud like Sen Warren
lol fraud?  #maga while assuming the position for Russia.  #gullible
#MAGA
when that's your comeback it let's me know you ain't got much

Keep them honest up there #SenWarren #2020.
Why don't you retract this post?  you know that was cancelled.

wow!  YOU complaining that others are unethical!  #giveupyourseat
5pm is NOT middle of the night & you stupid Democrats have no room to talk about middle of the night & closed doors
*here*
Snakes in the grass!
my heart is breaking for our country.  I wish ppl would read a history book this isn't a good idea. 
Good punctuation is not a bad thing.  Just saying.
I know that, it's just hard when you are tweeting sometimes. :)
just like what you did with aca
Pls hold them accountable! Their goal is 2 bob & weave until we forget & their shenanigans become normalized!   #USA1st
Right after you explain why the Senate has no comparable office.  @HouseGOP
We won't forget this attempt.
Trump already weighed in on this but U people keep the negative narrative going.that is why Dems lost. you will lose 2
THE REPUB'S /GOPERS : JUST LIKE THE THEIVES IN THE NIGHT THAT THEY ARE, DESTROYING AMERICANS RIGHTS FOR THEIR OWN GAINS

Pence was one of 10 Republican governors to expand Medicaid under Obamacare. http://khn.org/Njc3NjY5  
Better retweet this, it was scraped by pres. Trump before it got any traction. How about you speaking the truth
This must be terribly offensive to the members of your tribe.
saved by Donald J.Trump! not by you! &not by killer Clinton! #DTS #NoAmnesty4Hillary
very utilitarian of the GOP...

Aparently you spoke too soon. Trump put a stop to that
Don't ever stop fighting for us
You are a pathetic liar!! Stop spewing your venomous hatred & trying to further divide ppl. You are supposed to unite!
How did they go from the party of family values to the "Axis of Evil"?
trump did one thing good I guess republicans and few deems do bad things for money
... You?  Preaching to others about ethics?  THAT IS HILARIOUS Pocahontas !!!
U are yesterday's news. U can't think 4 self. Have 2 be parrot 4 Dumpster. Brainless wonder the second.
... ?
#Republicans & #PaulRyan  remember #Trump did not win the popular vote (41% approval) & #Congress (18% approval) OUCH.
We the MAJORITY of the people need to work now to vote out the GOP in 2018.
We have Democratic leaders. We are not doomed. Suggest: @IndivisibleTeam
the fact they thought this was important enough to be the first thing they do should sound alarms in all Americans
HELLO!!! They elected DONALD TRUMP, they are not hearing alarms...
Some more alarms for you. Read this and my pinned tweet:
point is some people don't need an "alarm" to sound to know a knife is in their face...
can they gut you too?
Please continue to take a stand and fight! It's why I voted for you.
We were never under the impression Republicans had ethics. Fight like hell, Senator.
Gain is the GOP's only ethic.

gotta do it now before people are watching. Donald said it isn't a priority now anyhow , just "stop it" .who remembers?
I am so hoping that Dems are organized enough to watch 24/7 during this Congress.  One on duty all the time!
Aren't they also violating some standing rules?  Notice, and meeting as a "Committee of the Whole"?
Thanks for vigilance.  Yes, the GOP is only backing down because it was too obvious.  They will try again.  be on guard
they learned from NC
well that didn't work, but they slipped through fines for protesting on House floor. Civil rights.
Who's watching over the ethics committees' ethics?
I'd like to believe the voice of the resistance played a rolein the walk back of the attempt to close watchdog office
@Robrt_M_Goldste @HouseGOP
It's ok for the entire world to know what our party is up to.  Hypocrisy and corruption at its finest
Yup because only us Dems should be held accountable for our crimes.
#ImpeachTrump  that is what you need to do @SenWarren @HouseGOP #resist #nevermypresident
lying again Poco
ya, cause middle of the night, no one is looking laws neber happen at the hands of democrats, right!
Like Obamacare was , ?
Stupidity on your part.
The people have spoken
funny that office opened early in Obama admin. How many Democrats were nailed?  I'm betting zero
Trump and the GOP are terrible #notmypresident
dirty pool.
LOL all of a sudden Dems pretend to care about ethics. You guys are a joke,
Tawdry little charade by GOP and Trump, One GOP! Reminds me of third world politicians playing to illiterate masses.
please run in 2020 and set this country to right!!
Classic democrat move. They've been watching and learning
1984 was not read by the reading challenged majority of the nation. Watch the RNC crooks in action henceforth
- This is how a democracy ends and a dictatorship begins.  Trump & the GOP are living up to our worst fears.
I suggested Obama should not leave the WH until everything clarified
we are toasted since no one have the guts to rebel
How ethical
This is so Awesome !!!
good!  Now tell us about your grand pappy's cheekbones.  I love that story!
They had an ethics office?
ZERO Senators held accountable last year by Ethics Committee
Only five members expelled in the history of the House Ethics- U.S. Rep James A. Traficant Jr. of Ohio in July of 2002.
#BullyBoyTrump is at it again.  Is there no person or company this guy won't try to bully.  @HouseGOP = wimps
Oh, Lizzy, your loyalty to HRC pretty much wrecked your creds on ethics issues.
you do a great job! Keep on, we're counting on you.
Shutup lizzy
sneaky sneaky lil repubs. Guarantee the fall of the American people.
the only thing that makes ANY sense, "go home @HouseGOP...you're drunk!".
well it's obvious they have no ethics
TY for keeping us informed.  Please don't be discouraged by the nay-sayers - we need your leadership
WAIT FOR THE FINAL RESULT LIZ. DON'T JUMP THE GUN.

GOP & ethics are at opposite ends of the stick. Gerrymeandering, stopping people of color from voting...not ethical.
All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men (& women) to do nothing. -Edmund Burke #RESIST
please keep fighting. Senator Warren, you're our only hope against the fascists
uhm... not anymore with Trump getting on them.
@jess_weixler @HouseGOP With that level of corruption Whywould theynot eliminate ethics office. It's a joke to dirty politicians
.. Please begin a Senate investigation of the Trump / Kremlin collusion.
it's up to folks like you now to stand strong against the tide!
This should be illegal.
This vile behavior will not be forgotten by history. GOP you can no longer ever claim to be "morality" party.
Similar to Carolina's voting to weaken the new Gov! What are they afraid of pre 2011?
please fight this gutting of the ethics comitte with every ounce of energy you have... now more than ever
This is pathetic. Disappointing.
We CANNOT allow this to happen!!! Soon we will be like North Korea or Drumpfs favorite place, Russia. #trumpforprison
why are you so silent on Israel's blatant disrespect for international law? What is your position on the illegal settlements?
- Yeah,  ethics is a bad word for Congress - it might expose them for who they really are! Even Trump objected. 
What about insider trading that congress is not subject to? What happened to the outrage for that? Sen EW remind ppl
.@SenWarren<-YOU endorsed corrupt @HillaryClinton...you know NOTHING of "ethics"...@HouseGOP
We must NEVER allow the Republican party to have control of the Government EVER again!!
A little late.
TOTALLY "expectable
@YellaDogTexan @HouseGOP Really just as ethical as those congressional 2am votes for their own raises...
The raises you talk about are automatic for anyone who works in the gvmt. Usually, 1%.
If they are automatic for all gov personnel why suspicious very late hr vote for only them?
oh great, what is going on, its sickening!
Oh, Ms. Warren. I wish you had run for Pres in 2016. I'd have broken my wrist pulling that lever so hard.
Thank you for keeping us informed.  We need more like you.
Showing their true colors.
Sounds suspicious Pocahontas! Sounds like something the Dems would do.
Sen Warren your job has never been more important. Thank you for your strong clear voice in DC. Voters know #ethicsmatter
'draing the swamp' = more room for toxic scum.  So UN- ethical!!
please lecture us on ethics?  By the way, what percentage of Native American are you this month? @housegop
. @SenWarren @HouseGOP dishonest Liz. There is still an ethics committee so b careful, u may be next up to b investigated. #Foolonthehill
greasing the skids?
All pretense at reform is gone, now pigs heading for trough w/o constraint.
This makes me mad. The GOP is a bunch of crooks!  Only interested in helping their rich friends and screwing the poor.
In 16 days darkness will fall on the American way of life and Evil rules the land, Ethics are dead
why do we have the criminals in charge of the cops in the first place?
@ABWashBureau @HouseGOP Yeah Liz not like @POTUS doing anything g under the cloak of darkness either #YouArePartOfTheProblem
- A sure sign they're preparing for ethical complaints that will be swept out the door.    BAD GOP KONGRESS, SHAME!
@RobinHoodTax @HouseGOP 

And how soon before the dems roll over for them?
@smille5884 @HouseGOP we are all noting Dem and GOP reps alike who do nothing to oppose Trump's criminal cronies destroying U.S.
Did the proposal end with "Hail Satan" or "Seig Heil" ?
@LisaMoraitis1 @HouseGOP tell us @SenWarren what can we do? How do we stop these criminals that are supposed to work 4 us? GOP= deplorables
our new president hates ethics so I can see why he would get rid of this office. Something to hide?
it's very VERY scary to me. Not a happy civilian AT ALL!!
This move makes GOP involvement in the Gr8 POTUS SCAM very possible!  At best cowards, at worst criminals.
Curious how GOP wants 2 remove due process from citizens via unions  it votes to extend more protections to themselves!
YOU asked for it when u ENDORSED @HillaryClinton !
And so it begins. I pray that all that this country has gained will not be lost in the next for years!
this surprises who exactly?
Great job @HouseGOP How is having 5 lib/dems & 1 Lib/repub on this committee fair? They are a joke & waste of tax dollars!!!
What do .@TheDemocrats intend to do about it?
How is everyone's Russian? 1/20/17 we become United States of Russia.
@realDonaldTrump says a lot about ethics moving forward... SICKENING!!!
Is there an Office of Senate Ethics? If not, both chambers now appear to have the same internal oversight bodies.
Is there any way to obstruct this from passing?
let's stay honest folks. That's why u r in office. Control your people, GOP.
You should've endorsed Bernie when it counted so we could've at least had a progressive POTUS to fight back
By the very ppl who have the least commendable ethics. Third world--here we come.
That's how criminals operate...
We need our Dem leaders to unite & step up. Resist. Don't normalize any of this
Evidently "Drain the Swamp" is code for "Make sure all levels of government are corrupt"- and GOP is happy to oblige
mishandling vacation funds . FBI , CIA should be handling crime investigations, otherwise what's the point . Cupcakes
ethics office is a waste of money . Last year they that whole department managed to recommend inquiry of one guy for
#MAGA = 
#MakeAmericanGreedAlmighty

Complain to yur rep I did. Here is where to find your Congressman http://www.house.gov/htbin/findrep 
Apparently they took some lessons from the NC legislature.
What did you expect from a bunch of over paid losers??
What can be done about this?
because they have no ethics!
Oh, THIS Dem in OKLA is screaming! I've used the words Jimmy and Swaggart at least five times and it's not 9AM!
You need to stop with your self serving mess and do what needs to be done-Call for a new election-otherwise just Hush!
terrifying. Where are the ethics? #resist
can you explain the ethical move @BarackObama just made with Israel? You are a joke
YOUR party tried to do the same thing in 2011 you faux outraged douchecanoe!
liberty can be lost in such small steps. We must be vigilant and take an active part in our government.
