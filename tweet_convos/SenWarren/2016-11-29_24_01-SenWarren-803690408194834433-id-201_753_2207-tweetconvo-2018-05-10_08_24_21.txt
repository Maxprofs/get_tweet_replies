Where I live (Pittsburgh) $15.00/hour is not a living wage for an adult wishing to have his/her own apt & car.
Some people work 60-80 hour weeks for less. $90-120k not a living wage?
Less than $15.00/hour?  That could be poverty or near poverty.  $90K is living wage but lots of hours.
Where's your pride in #StandingRock?  You and @POTUS are really fucking over the people who put you in office, Liz.  #Legacy
yep that's dems for ya
that will teach the Libs to fuck with businesses!!!
Exactly! Raising the minimum wage will raise prices & workers out of a job! Employers are not dumb.@markmasseygca4 @SenWarren
$15 is not a living wage.  no one can add to the economy on that wage.
true $15 is not a living wage in Oregon right now it's $9.50 I think so 15 is a whole heck of a lot better than that
Can you cite a source for that figure?  I'd like to see.  Also, could you live on that?
Federal minimum wage is a terrible idea!Wages should be by county as living wages are different everywhere! @USuckDT @SenWarren
you should have taken economics while pretending to be Native American in college. You have no clue how it works.
Is everyone going to see their wages increase with comparable percentages? Or is this simply another redistribution of wealth?!
she is a horrible person, yes she's part of the rich, don't let her sway u
what union can these fast food employees join?

#fightfor15 suffers a setback in fast food industry

Never saw that coming huh?
haha yep your on the money
#NoDAPL your silence is deafening
right on
: Me too, but a lot of them voted for trump so it's hard to raise enthusiasm.
Because its a terrible idea. You fall for the inequality trap! Raising min wages makes poor MORE reliant on welfare. @SenWarren
And U will fight to get them food stamps when they are replaced by other people are by machines #Fightfor15
yep
Why stop at $15/hr? Make it $300/hr so everyone can afford a multi-million $$$ Cambridge house like you!
I'd think that a millionaire like you Liz would be Fightingfor75 for these people.  Why $15 an hour?  Why not $75 an hour?
what a surprise
Who will pay for this added cost? What will they pay for the added cost ?
Of course you are...
@jayfermin 

Tell T that and settle his Union issues with good wages and benefits. T bring back his jobs from overseas.

I am not opposed. I am concerned about the rising prices of everything that would occur if the minimum wage would be raised.
You should be opposed. Raising min wage does not help reduce poverty & like you said it will raise prices 4 everyone @SenWarren
Elizabeth, could you please do something to convince the men haters of our party that we need their votes too.42℅of women r repub

You're well suited for dems in MA. They all yearn for Marxism and all it's beneficial effects.
what about #dapl?
I beg you read, and absorb, this socialism antidote before you rear your head from the Marxist basket again. 
what about unemployment? does that fly?
Raising min wage will not end poverty. 2/3 of MW workers aren't in poverty& it makes things worse w/ raising prices! @SenWarren
I'm with you all the way. Proud of you  Sen Warren. You should run for president someday.
Raising min wage only makes it harder to get entry level jobs. Socialized wages don't work when nobody works hard.. @SenWarren
We have areas of $15, just voted to raise min wage statewide, not enough but a start. All deserve honest pay for honest work.
I'd undo that. Raising min wage only superficially works. Eventually the economy catches up w/ those inflated prices @SenWarren
Thanks from all of us. We heart you.
Minimum wages are already taken care of by companies & local min wages. Raising federal min wage just raises prices @SenWarren
Where is the money going to come from? When individual states are voting on these measures why the need for a national change?
From the employers.  Who pays your wages?
Its a bad idea. Min wage jobs have very little excess profit. Min wage only makes prices rise 4 everyone @SladeHG @SenWarren
Exactly. Raising the min wage causes more HS dropouts and less going to college too. Why work hard when you get it free? @SenWarren
Helping protect but this will b slow death for American business. Get smart!!! Think like a business growth
did you ever take a basic economics class in college? Raise minimum to 15, everything else goes up. Hours go down, who wins?
@MarleyHay_Progr This is the chief moron who promotes Victimhood not economic freedom
but not proud to support the American Flag in your State! #DumpWarrenNow @gehrig38 @CurtForMA Curt for Senate 2018!
get the he'll out of here, your replacing people with machines
there you go raise cost of living and make them pay taxes that they don't do now. They will still b in poverty
Exactly most people in poverty do not make the min wage. Raising it only hurts them more by increasing prices! @SenWarren
Unions gave us the rise of the middle class and the weekend.  Donald says workers make too much.  #notmypresident
#Trump is fighting 4 Freedom of Contract, raising federal min wages is bad for the USA & free stuff = no hard work! @SenWarren
go get a job!
you have zero idea of supply demand! I've watched local MCD advertise 4 help 4 5 years! Advertising $15 hr & still can't fill job
.@SenWarren @AC360 Elizabeth spoke Bernie's message not that of HRC. @SenSanders @GreenPartyUS @DrJillStein @ajamubaraka @ninaturner @MSNBC
@SenSanders a 16 y.o. making $15/hr in rural US is just stupid. This is delegitimizing you with Dems and small biz owners like me

Plz take a stance on Standing rock.
@SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @OfficialCBC 
- I'm with her
You got rich flipping poor peoples houses.
sure you are. You don't have to live in an economy that's forced on others.
I respect you a lot.I would like to see you at North Dakota pipeline protest.Big oil, corrupt Wall Street, human rights, environm
union rights are so important and under siege. Proud member of American nurses union. Keep fighting for us!!
easy to be proud when you have multi-millions and keeping them all to yourself
we should help people with training, so they can get promotions and raises.
yes the past 8 years have been an utter failure
ARE YOU KIDING MRS MOUTH YOU DID NOTHING BUT SUPPORT ILLEGALS YOU SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUTABLE FOR BREAKING OUR NATIONS LAWS ON THIS
weren't you a professor at Harvard Law? Must be somewhat educated? You do understand that this won't work right?
MT: @SenWarren is proud to #Fightfor15 alongside workers in Massachusetts & nationwide to make most of you unemployable #AutomatedWorkers
.      U R a hybrid, part energizer bunny and
part scarecrow!
cannot be a progressive and not stand with standing rock. Your silence is deafening #NoDAPL
Thanks for the acknowledgement of the Mass Firefighters of the year award recipients!
Horrible economics but fantastic politics. Isn't that right, Lizzy?
Too bad you aren't standing with the #WaterProtectors at #StandingRock who are having their civil rights trampled on. Coward.
@CNN @ABC @CBS @NBC @BBCNews @HillaryClinton @MomsThoughts @AlecBaldwin @RT_com
PETITION ELECTORS!
Remember when you endorsed $12 is enough $Hillary over Bernie who always stood for $15 minimum wage?  #demexit
My 17 yr old lives at home and I buy him food - why should he be making $15/hr?! He'll lose his job if minimum is raised!
It's past time to outlaw ALL public #unions especially the money laundering, racketeering @SEIU thugs. #FightFor15 is unAmerican
Public service unions have an unfair bargining advantage. The boss can tax everyone else for the workers.
Why still no stance on #DAPL ?
This tweet was brought to you by George Soros
How about fighting for the people of Standing Rock?  Where are you on this?  Are you not pround to fight along side them?
yet mexicans farm workers not included in this raise
We elected Trump. He will fix this the right way.
Job killing legislation is what the democrats offer.Reject @TheDemocrats at all levels of gov.
FIGHT FOR THE MILITARY A YOUNG COMBAT SOLDIER DOESNT MAKE $15 AN HOUR BUT YOU DONT CARE PANDERING FOR VOTES ON THE LIBERAL COASTS
Hooray! Union thugs! Corruption! Violence! And jobs DISAPPEAR at an alarming rate while you ride in your limo.
Please keep up your good work we need you and senBernie .
you are the best. Please keep up the good work.
ELIZABETH. WARREN. IT'S HAPPENING. WE'RE ENTERING KLEPTOCACY LAND
What about the people on a fixed income like social security who don't get a raise but must deal with the higher cost of living.
$15 hurts the lower middle class.  http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2014/11/26/the-facts-on-the-minimum-wage-increase/#748873c952ad …
You have to pick  one - higher relative wages for American workers - or infinite workers coming into the country (incl. illegals)
Start with your buddy that sat on the board of Wal-Mart. HRC must still know ppl there. Or are you just talking to hear yourself?
OUCH... !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank you for your unwavering support!
Driving more businesses to Right to Work states. We thank you in Florida!
no you're not. All any of you #Senators do is show up 4-5 months a year then collect high wages&benefits. #CrawlBackUnderYourRock
Whatever, you are a proud ass for sure!
Union Marxist stooges
retire warren, nobody likes you.
Your silence on Standing Rock doesn't fly either. #StandWithStandingRock
#NoDAPL Please use your voice for the people suffering for their rights in ND.
Don't ever stop fighting Liz!
When will you speak out for Native Americans fighting for clean water at #standingrock? #NoDAPL
double down on your horrible policies
While I agree with most everything you say, I do NOT support $15 as a minimum wage!!!
Sure you are.
can you imagine a burger flipper making more that skilled carpenter, because that what will happen. Some jobs get paid in cash.
https://www.gofundme.com/fightforfreestuff …
min wage should be adjusted for regional cost of living per state. One size fits all screws all.
all you are doing is push technology to replace unskilled worker faster.
can you Democratic's call @POTUS to save Stading people being attacked and losing food now

why won't you fight for #NoDAPL
Your a day short and a dollar short, what trust u no way
@OurRevolution Thank you for supporting#Fightfor15! Please help by lending your support to Standing Rock too. We need more voices
pls make conversation about the "legalized" voter suppression & cross-check 
violates civil rights it needs 2 B a focus right now
.
nice lie pocahontas you dont care and they know it
I would really appreciate it if you showed more concern about the constitutional crisis we're in. :-(
nurses aides, EMTs, childcare workers, receptionists, pharmacy technicians...
Where's your statement on Standing Rock?
but you still ignore Standing Rock #NoDAPL
fight to deport illegals, keep good jobs in US and make America Great Again.
keep pushing about putting this into law and u will start seeing more a more self service that u are already seeing in mostStores
I got a $350,000 Teaching job @ Harvard claiming I was Native American.
It is not incumbent upon employers to pay you what you think you should be paid. You agreed to the wage. So shut up.
Also called, "Fighting to be replaced by a kiosk."
you should #Fightfor15 for gov representatives. Then tax payers wouldn't need such a high minimum wage.
You've been a progressive idol of mine, but your hesitancy to vocally support the #NoDAPL is confounding, to say the least.  Why?
yes, but still nothing for #StandingRock...
Also need to fight for investigation of Trump's taxes and COIs. His foreign entanglements may compromise America's interests.
#Fightfor15
Why don't you go stand beside #standingrock where you are really needed.  #NoDAPL I lost all respect for you & many others.
yep, glad you see them for what they are
&worldwide?! why don't you fight to free Palestine! end blockade of Gaza! support BDS! #povertydoesntfly no more #HillarysWars
It takes no courage to say you want to #fightfor15 with GOP congress. How's about you #StandWithStandingRock instead?
please speak up about the Dakota access pipeline
Why won't you fight alongside the water warriors at Standing Rock, Senator Warren?! Where is your progressive leadership?!?!
she has none
Care to prove us wrong, Senator? We will not let this issue go. Believe me. #StandWithStandingRock #WaterProtectors
