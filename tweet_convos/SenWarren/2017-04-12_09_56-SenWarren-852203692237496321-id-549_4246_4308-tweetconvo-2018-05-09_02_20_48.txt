DeVos rolled back protections that make it harder for student loan companies that cheat borrowers to keep raking in gov contracts.
Is she getting a kickbacks from the loan companies? I may never get mine paid off. Now they take it from my SSA now that I am 65.
@co_rapunzel4 @CitizensFedUp #Veterans #Law Report: Trump gave $10 Million to Chaffetz when he leaked FBI letter http://www.palmerreport.com/opinion/10-million-chaffetz-trump-russia/2392/ â€¦
30 years behind bars for Chaffetz if he cooperates.If not give him LWOTPOP. TREASON is the reason 4 the end of your season.O so very Pleasin

Its about that GREED!
Disgusting greed!
Yes, Greed at any cost.
#BetsyDeVos has no soul.
Why?
Another Trump selection poops the bed
Poop the bed?? She shit the house...
Of course she did. She probably has skin in that game too.
We can't protect our students, let them go to military or jail to get education
Brother Blackwell...........stunning that this just continues to happen when it is right in front of our noses.
These people like to overthrow governments
Seems like there's a big conflict of interest here.  (Yet another one for this woeful admin).
Only qualification is that there is a conflict
My grandson says if you know you can't pay back the loan, then why get It? Smart kid. He does not want a debt he can't pay back.
Sure, makes sense to me, make a law allowing them to not payback borrowed money, before they borrow it, and then act SURPRISED if they don't
Keeping the populace uneducated works for DeVos. But she forgets we need them to get the next Big Thing.
#Devos
The military has an obligation to stop the overthrow of the government
Yes it does. I have faith in IC. I think #TrumpRussia #IllegitimateTrump will be removed via them.
@AylaKessler @usedgov @washingtonpost WHY?
Drama queen! Lol, you are embarrassing yourself, no worries, you will never be prez!
from PREDATOR schools hiding cash and raising tuition....good for her
You are a liar. You need help. You are a pathological liar.
How about this Warren, how about you try to do your job and let others do their job! What is your purpose? Is your job to bash the GOP?
Disgusting witch...
My daughter paid back her 350,000 by hard work and determination.  Millennials need to learn responsibility and accomplishment on their own.
These people running our country, there are no words for how vile they are. All I can say is love and help everyone!
They're not running the country they're overthrowing the government
The entire administration seems to be a pit of vipers!
That's because @BetsyDeVos doesn't care about students. She cares about corporations and banks
Money. She seeks to be with MONEY, bigly!
What is wrong with these people? They claim to want to "Make America Great Again" but for who? The wealthy who already have enough money!
"...if you think the wealthy already have enough money, you've obviously never been wealthy...geesh!"
Lol
All Trump appointee's are lining their pockets through conflict of interest policies
Well, you know, she does need to add to her millions. Since they've thrown ethics out the window.)
Warren you have a perverted crush on DeVos so sick
Who is your controller! Who has their hook in you! It will surface, won't be long!

Betsy has no knowledge about education, no past experience yet her money made her head of EDUCATION. Yes we are making US great (dumb)again
Yes & how are you going to get @BetsyDeVosED out of there she owns million in student loan debt recovery machine & charter schools! #resist
No one in Ms DeVos' billionaire family has ever needed to take loan to attain a college degree. She's never been on the sticky side of life!
DeVos is ONE HORRIBLE PERSON! Selfish and Greedy!
Another scumbag without a heart. Thank you, Elizabeth, for being our voice.
But, hey, middle class.  Keep voting Republican.  They're looking out for your interests!
Well considering this is an easily provable lie then yes
Conflict of interest!
So are you saying that the students shouldn't be responsible for their debt? Amazing you ARE part of the participation group.
outraged!
I guess Rich people have no respect for those that are not as well off. Thank you, Betsy, for showing your true colors.
Heartless Trump puppet. Elizabeth stay strong. Please save our children.
Anything Obama put into policy needs to be ripped up! Every appointment he made needs to be removed! Be an American and support President!
Go away bot!!! Stop foreign interference!!!
I suppose giving free college to all is a better idea? You and your pal Hilary would bankrupt this country.
Thank God for DeVos
The entire Cabinet reflects self interest and making money from their contacts. Lock them up! Trump too
Using "fake news" that often comes from the Washington Post says nothing.
Like you really care! You are such a phony! DEFEAT WARREN 2018!
Gosh... I guess those Bernie or Bust cronies have to admit maybe there is a difference between @HillaryClinton and Trumpy.
Let students eat cake...
DeVos is not only unqualified, she's incompetent, a narrow minded, heartless sociopath. Student debt will destroy the economy.
@elizabethforma going after Betsy Devos like Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction pursuing Michael Douglas. Scary creepy. Girlfight!
She makes children drink poisoned water too.
Students need to pay off their loans just like anyone else who borrows money.  I understand you want tax payers to pay it for them.  BS
Anything done by you or Osama was not done for anything but political gain.  Too bad 4 you everyone sees that and is fixing your mess
Anything and anyone is second to the almighty dollar
Who actually believes billionaires would do anything other than grease the skids for other billionaires? Trump supporters that's who.
How good were they or just a bandaid on your way out?
Thank God for Betty DeVos who is doing the right thing. You would never say anything good about a Republican if they solved all our problems
and you're a rich not too aren't you Elizabeth Warren
GO Betsy DeVos!
@BetsyDeVos What a shocker .. NOT! Billionaires make crappy bedfellows for the 99%
This woman is clueless on education, & Trump should be ashamed of himself of nominating her for the head of the department! #feelsorry4kids
Well do something to stop this. Kids are in serious debt with rising school costs and mounting debt
Cuz she has a vested financial reason.
She is now known as "Evil DeVos"
GOOD,GOOD,GOOD. Thank you Betsy Devos
DeVos is sick. They all are.
@a35362 @usedgov @washingtonpost please get her out of that office. She's dangerous.
Betsy DeVos spells education eduKKKation
@MAHAMOSA @usedgov @DaniDougPost she would be in her position were this ANY other administration. This is all a dangerous joke.
This woman has no business being in cabinet.
#nofreelunch4starvingkids
in your mind no one can do good in office if they're a  Republican what the hell the matter with you?
can't you say something other than a b**** b**** b**** what the hell's the matter with you?
Good for Betsy! She's doing her job.
Well hopefully other states will follow NYS example and make the need for college loans obsolete - I know that is an oversimplification ;)
Retire please, ur a fool
Yep Devos sucks--thats what we get allowing in a fascist regime.
She's a disaster. But she's a billionaire and that's why Trump nominated her and the Republicans confirmed her. You know money talks.
Trump & Goldman Sachs monsters with cult nuts will drain US treasury & has declared war on Working class, poor &  preexisting period Unreal
Not  qualify  for  the  job
Wonder how many members of Congress have kids who needed #studentloans Guessing none who voted to confirm #devos #Unacceptable
Grrrrrr!
Another anti-american policy from this brainless GOP operative. Devos, prove to us how this helps tax payers.  Show us FACTS and data.
Please run with @SenSanders #Sanders/Warren2020
Rest of the world (rich & poor) provide quality education for free or for little cost.  Why can't we?
Because she wants to rip them off
Incredibly NUTS!
This bimbo married into the Amway fortune. She's a dumb as a box of rocks. Could care less about anyone but herself. Truly ignorant.
DeVos is evil. . .
It took me 6 years to complete my Associates of Science because I paid out of pocket myself. I'm finally getting loans for my BA. Tired.
Cannot like this. DeVos is evil.
Everyday something new and horrific from this administration
Correct they have to be overhauled, only protected ones were non citizens
@timkaine did you vote against her ?
Good for her. That needed to be done.
Back 2 the altar of commercialisation. What a surprise but how stupid and shallow. she is hurting the next generation so watch out!
As a special ed teacher and someone paying off student loans for my masters, DeVos is the worst thing for education.
How can we continue to let this happen?! HELP!
Conflict of interest for her to even have her position.  Remember the Repubs put her there over concerns.  Vote them out!
So now the American will see that she is not good for America
She is the worst idea ever.
What would you expect from a whole WH full of corporate shills.
Secretary of education shows us all once again she doesn't know shit
She's so despicable. It's pathetic when I know I could do her job better than her, but she could never do mine. #iamapublicschoolteacher
#yourefiredCruellaDeVos
She an ass. She has no damn business running ed plus she just got appointed because she gave a lot of money. She never dealt with loans read
Suppose this means Qusay and Uday can re-open #TrumpU while Daddy & gang literally & figuratively send the world spinning off its axis?

and all 45's appts r requesting huge amts in security ....whats the worry???
The corruption in this Administration is staggering. #resist
She even looks greedy... Trump's problem is that he is so in love with himself...
@BetsyDevos - what is your problem?!? Was this your agenda all along? To rip off people who just want to have a higher education? #integrity
#Devosnotworthamillionaday
She is truly a menace to education
The whole damned Trump administration, has money in their veins instead of blood.
#EvilWitchDeVos #EvilWitchDeVos
I have nothing nice to say about this privileged ______! She wakes up every day trying to find a new way to screw people who don't have$$$$!
Cannot believe anything you say after that fake Indian stuff to get preferential treatment and more money. Fauxcahantas
3rdworldifying the USA
Conflict of interest. She & her family make $$$ on these loans. Costs $$ to buy cushy apt's from Trump
she's another one of those that committed perjury & bought the job. what would we expect - something good?
You @BetsyDeVos are NO friend to education. It's clear that your friends are big banks. #disgusting
Betsy DeVos will be a disaster for all education in U.S.
@BetsyDeVosED betsy, can you do us all a favor and quit already? Thanks so much!
This b**** is going to destroy our entire educational system from kindergarten through college single-handedly
Of course. She owns one. Why don't Dems look to get her thrown out!!
What is wrong with that hateful woman??
WTF???
Hopefully she'll go down when the DeVos Spectrum Health / Trump Tower / Alfa Bank connection warrants are issued
She has a mission - destroy public ed, impoverish all but the 1%, dismantle her department. BUT, she's dumb enough to fail here, too.
good...you borrow from the taxpayers you should pay it back with interest
Whose watching the Fox in the hen house Sen Warren? DeVos owns holdings in debt collection firms w contracts w the Dept of Ed worth $20m +
YOU let her get confirmed. Tired of you guys acting like there is nothing u can do! Pruitt, Price, Sessions perjured! Bet she did 2!
She bought her position now to tell with everyone else.
DeVos ripped up policies that weren't doing any good. Put ur pussy hat away & act like a reasonable adult instead of scaring ppl.
would you mind asking our junior senator from MT @SteveDaines if Betsy has ethics problem here?  After all he did vote to confirm #mtpol
She is another ditz....wealthy donor who has no experience for this position!!  This administration is absolutely pathetic... A disaster!!
While making the company she is invested in money. NOT OK
Absolutely, NOT OKAY
When it is FINALLY proven that Trump is not the legitimate president we can also throw out his rotten picks!
Not surprising!  I knew she'd be trouble.  Heaven help us!
Policies to promote irresponsibility on people's finance you mean? Well removed. Now get to work and pay it back
@DavidKoechner @usedgov @washingtonpost That's because she'll make a boatload of money now that the policies are gone #dirtball
blah, blah  blahdeblahblah
Starts with a C. Ends with a T.
BETSY STEPDOWN U HAVEN'T A CLUE HOW THE MIDDLECLASS LIVES BREATHS & STRUGGLES 2 PUT OUR CHILDREN THRU COLLEGE POWER 2 THE PEOPLE RESIST GOPS
What? Fight back Liz!
Sec. DeVos has no respect for Americans who have to work for living.
Government by the plutocrats and zealots. Who the f**k wants this?!
What does she even know about paying for education she is q disaster....!
