The only sincerity I believe is Bernie's u senator Warren are just doing pr for yourself
ISDS is not the only bad thing about TPP.... #NoTPP period! Read Bernie.

Such trade deals, TPP are an attack on democracy itself.
If you & Sherrod truly cared abt trade deals, you would've backed Sanders for president.
@ChrisDHamby too little too late. You should have joined @BernieSanders during primary
You are nut's. I question your competency.
But u r  behind a candidate that want the TPP
And where was Hillary???????
@BuzzFeedNews stop the global crap...be concerned for your country
- thank you & #maytheforcebewithyou!! #globalsupercourt #TPP
never care about renegotiating b4,why start now?when did positions that favor US matter?
since when do politicians ever renegotiated r positions 2 favor the people?never
if the elites were getting hurt as much as the commoners, it woulda changed 8 yrs ago
if the elites wernt getting rich, they would have changed this long ago. common-sense
they wont change, china is paying the dems 2 well 2 change. get rich from our suffering
had 20 yrs 2 reverse our tradedeals,DON TRUST U. CHINAGATE CONTINUES BY SELLING OUR JOBS
@SenateDemsa -mill jobs and -a trill in trade, u wanna change now?now?dont think so,trump will do it
The broader public needs further education on this issue.....
@BuzzFeedNews I will address this subject this Thursday at
What about the copyright laws and patent laws aimed at censoring the net ? #TPP
Junk TTP completely, the middle class has already been well screwed by NAFTA.
Pennsylvania mayor posts racist meme about lynching  Obama
@BuzzFeedNews Chelsea Clinton takes private jet to 'clean energy' roundtable
Thank you for opposing TPP
No #TPP, No #ISDS @SenWarren @SenSherrodBrown @SenSanders @SenateDems tell @POTUS @BarackObama
@BuzzFeedNews https://twitter.com/neilturner_/status/779371485693616128 …
Yet you're endorsing Clinton - a candidate who supported NAFTA-WTO & KORUS, & will push for #TPP. No credibility. @AFLCIO #NoTPP
Love It
Are you aware they are using your photos?
@crazytimes73 @SenSherrodBrown @SenSanders @SenateDems @BuzzFeedNews shame u never endorsed @SenSanders
What sell outs you are.  No supporter of working people would back the TPP.
Lizzy u have been on fire Same of ur ideas r not so bad I will put a good word to Pres Trump so u can get on the Trump Train
.@SenWarren You'll have better luck getting @TheDemocrats to #DumpHillary 
#BernieOrJill
@SenSanders @SenateDems @DrJillStein @ChrisDHamby
You are a rockstar.
Just remove TPP.
@BuzzFeedNews Just say NO!
.@SenWarren Turn traitors like @TimKaine and @SenBennetCO or you're just Grandstanding. @SenateDems @ChrisDHamby
This is unworthy of you!! Full opposition....no compromise!
This is alarming. Before: NO to TPP. Now: TPP ok without ISDS. Next "modify" ISDS
.@SenWarren Pulling just #ISDS from #TPP is insufficient. The whole thing's got to go. Start from scratch. Open. No cronyism. @ChrisDHamby
.@SenWarren Pulling just #ISDS from #TPP so @HillaryClinton can say "Now I support it" is insufficient. @ChrisDHamby
Let us know when you've turned Obama and these traitors like @SenBennetCO 
@SenSherrodBrown @SenSanders
@atlanta4bernie blah, blah, blah. No respect for you. Stop pandering to us!
This is just to give cover to many other parts of detrimental provisions of TTP.
@BuzzFeedNews hilary said she didn't care about America& shimmied& giggled at the debate
@BuzzFeedNews while your at it Warren stop that Monsanto/Bayer merger. National security
the corporate lawyers who benefit most are democrats! You're biting the hand that feeds you!
...and in Europe we are afraid of US companies sueing whole countries (as Uruguay)
That's the Holy Trinity right there! (No offense, Bernie).
Think it would be possible to make negotiating trade deals in secret illegal?
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THIS FRAUD !!!  http://www.newsweek.com/2016/10/14/donald-trump-cuban-embargo-castro-violated-florida-504059.html …
@BuzzFeedNews Just stop the whole thing! We need smarter trade agreements that work.
Dont know if we can,Obama,Dems, and Repubs all pushing for it
As long as you are there I don't worry about TPP! Thank You!
@BuzzFeedNews Good start, but what else should come out?
,@SenWarren @SenSherrodBrown @SenSanders @SenateDems 
Don't you mean, "No to TPP"?
As in.. No.. to the entire mess. You all get that, right?
@BuzzFeedNews Good job! We cannot allow foreign courts to decide laws for our country.
