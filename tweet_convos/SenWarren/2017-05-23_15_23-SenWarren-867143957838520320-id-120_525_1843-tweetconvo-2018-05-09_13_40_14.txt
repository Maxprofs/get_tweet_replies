Good news: We put a stop to the predatory conflicts of interest that cost Americans saving for retirement $17B/yr.
We canâ€™t let our guard down. The Trump Admin & giant financial firms made it clear: they'll try to roll back this rule as soon as they can.

has the first lawsuit been filed by your slip and fall lawyers yet. the entire purpose of this law, raising costs and enriching your buddies
And Trump takes away yet another way to help Middle and lower classes! This guy has absolutely no conscious!
Repubs always campaign they will help the middle class but screw them over. Why do they keep falling for it?  Is it "willful" stupidity?
I've never understood why anyone but the rich would vote for Repubs!

He is not our President anymore, understand? Entiende? Capische?
Thank you @SenWarren for all you do
Thank you for supporting the middle class.
When we talk about the Olligarchs who buy our politicians, we must remember @realDonaldTrump is an #Olligarch
We're you also with Barry when he violated the Constitution & spied on Americans?
We need you back more than ever.
Interesting jacket Liz...is that new?
Shut the Schumer up!
It was dumb then...why not create a fiduciary standard for all accounts not just IRAs?  Typical gov't inefficiency and ineffectiveness.
That's because its a horrible rule. Complying with BICE as an independent would be hell. Stop supporting issues you know nothing about..
Hay left blank hay rite blank whom do u say the blank in the middle is
Senator Warren, please run in 2020. You'll have my vote for sure.
Interesting how all of the bad grammar, childish insults and inane "political thought" comes from poor folks on the right. Sad for them.
Funny how the left just can't get over its mental illness masquerading as intellectual & moral superiority. Keep sippin' the Dems Koolaid
So much dumb in one pic.
Some with power focus on numbers and $ - but the great in power focus on people - and how they can help people!
Please keep up the fight some people don't get it yet
Obama just won't shut up and let Trump fix what he screw up!!
If obummer made something it's not good  for the people

Lizzy the Pocahontas of the east! So what tribe are you from? Oh you just lied about being Indian to get a job! Sounds disrespectful to me!
thanks elizabeth for looking out for us
Lizzy, Looks like Three losers to me! Obumer was a loser! You are a loser! Move on Lizzy, the US is sick of you!
Senator, you keep making the mistake of attaching yourself to establishment Wall St. cronies like Obama and Perez. Cut loose now. Win.
Obama is a true President whether he's in office or not.
So what's your point?
Not sure  what this is. Is this where u n BO got those large Swiss bank accounts? Or was it when u 2 took Indian land for big WS backers.
Wer you there when he set his records? 2018!
These people got their power from some Dems too, this didn't just happen over night #$outofpoliticsnow #DoYourJob
As a compliance professional in the financial industry, I wholeheartedly support the DOL rule.
#SethRich
The question is will it work as well as ObamaCare?
Crook and crookette, no class and no credibility
You sat behind him like a good lap dog.
You were with Obama when all this government spending went rogue.
Then you know exactly how the rest of us feel
Repeal/do away @USDOL. It's a burden on tax payers.
I wish you would lead the Democratic Party
Nice Photoshop immage POCAHONTAS
Hillary is alive and well in your dumb add speculation. No concern for working America. Jeep the welfare rolling for Islamic immigrant. 98%
We don't want big government.
That photo is stunning, Larry, Curly n Mo
It's a stupid rule. It will hurt investors not help
Great Job
I have an idea lets get some cash like 2 or 3 million and lets load it on a plane and give it to n-Korea. That's a Dem classic move.
That can't be good for anyone if Obama show was involved!
3 people nobody wants to see or listen to...
The thought of a financial advisor robbing you blind warms the cockles of my heart
We can see the brown circle on your nose
Keep fighting....we the people first, predators must be contained.  Good business is our business.
U supported every Obama initiative. From support Muslim brotherhood to creation of ISIS. #complicit #traitor to constitutional republic
Sounds like you're just parroting Trumps BS, figure out what fiduciary duty is before jump cowboy
Not all of us. Some of us have always been fee-only and have always voluntarily acted as a fiduciary. We oppose removing these protections.
Curly Larry and Moe
I was actually stunned that this wasn't ALREADY a rule.

Indian princess speaks with forked tongue
Losers!
Was this when Obama called isis a JV team?
Senator Warren Thank you for watching our Country's Back we need you!
This country has gotten to be so sad PROFITS OVER HUMANITY.
Investigation is on going
@POTUS44 has presidential hands.  Hey boo!!
Trump's hands?  Men wish their doctor had those size hands for their prostate exam!
Are you native American? @BarackObama @USDOL
I am ..
ObamaGate investigation is ongoing
You guys are so fucking delusional

Nobody cares

But we didn't lose the popularity contest, you're a wanna be prom queen that 45 wouldn't even walk in on
Hey Snowflake- get a job and work for a living - pay taxes - then get back to me. I'll take it easy on you because you don't know any better
I have no clue what this is. But if Obama was pushing it, its shit and needs turned back. Every single thing he did was poisonous.
The rule forces retirement financial advisors to work in their client's interests not to line their pockets, called fiduciary responsibility


You have zero accomplishments as a senator.
Geoff Diehl has the back of Mass taxpayers.
nobody wants to hear from you.keep quite!
Keep quite?
Some people's kids....Haha. I'll never be quiet..oh I think that's a Bot...02685303.' Ha,ha the # gives them away..lol
