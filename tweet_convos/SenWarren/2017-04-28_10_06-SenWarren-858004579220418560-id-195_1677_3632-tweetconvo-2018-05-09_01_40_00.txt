Thank you Senator Warren!!
So you attack the black man for speaking fees, but you're mute on Jane Sanders Bank Fraud FBI investigation? Really, wow, to be a black man!
I think what we're saying is that it reeks of income inequality, and a lazy crawl to easy$$. But I'm all for stealing from Wall St!!
Your @POTUS44 was happy to accept a significant sum of money to speak to on Wall Street.
So what? He is worth it. And you might not have noticed, but he is no longer president, having been replaced by a pretender.
He is worth the world
Have U noticed the dangers left in the Middle East from the lack of US leadership over the last 8 years?
North Korean's face hardships U cant fathom
Crazy dictator willing to fire a nuke when he gets it...yes preventative measures necessary...
...before we are all forced to live under tyranny.
Are you really in denial? THEY are trying to do a whole lot more than any of this crap you are fighting daily! Stop this NOW! #Impeach
We can't let history repeat itself!
we do not want a repeat of 1930's germany
CA is poised to pass SINGLE PAYER thru BOTH parties.
How much u making off ur book? Serious question thx

And since Bernie is NOT POTUS - thank you Elizabeth - here we sit.
You handed them the gift.
NOW THEY'RE SPENDING A MILLION AN "HOUR", TO LISTEN TO OBAMA SPEAK. CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT TREASON HE HAS TO SAY, WORTH THAT KIND OF MONEY.
But Obama...mirite
Trump & corrupt GOP is hell bent on dismantling any safeguards for the American people. It is blatantly obvious what they are doing.
Correct. Time to focus on local politics, like CA bipart passing of single payer.
Stop it somehow pls I'm still trying to coup with all the reverses on everything that protects our planet
I hear you, Diana. Depression hovers, but active resistance helps. Write, call, text, march, join Indivisibles about things you believe in.
I'm a 60's child great then now the body doesn't want to let the "joining" part work anymore. Now all I can do is Twitter & that's ok
Diana, you can do more. Look at apps Countable, 5 Calls. Find & go to Indivisible meetings near you! You'll meet the amazing, good-hearted
“DNC Shatters The Illusion Of American Democracy In Order To Keep People’s 27 Bucks” by Caitlin Johnstone
Ask obama to donate his $400k speaking fee back then
Another perfect example that Republicans are not the representatives of We the People, but the slaves of Corporation's & their big money.
Make Primaries Ethical Again
And Obama gets paid half a million for a 15 minute speech. What a f'ing hypocrite. Woooow!! #Greed
Hey Liz - how about some outrage over your buddy Obama getting paid $400k for A speech by Wall Street?
Stop them PLEASE
Let your voice be heard!
Disgraceful!!!! #resist
That's just great.
They want our economy to crash so they can blame it on Obama and Dems. But their fingerprints will be all over it. Lowest of the low
And Obama is now their Spokesman making $400,000 for a single Speech! Just like the Clintons only care about themselves and their wealth
2300 pages of regulations? You talk predatory lenders. Where is Payday Loans and Cash Advance in this?
Your buddy @POTUS44 is profiting pretty well off Wall Street.
Take on the fight you can win not harm the party.
Wall st does love to gamble with tax payer money and no accountability ...if American's lets them do it again were fools
They are bent on enslaving the American people
Stay strong Sen. Warren.  America needs you.
Unbelievable!
It's hard for me to believe sometimes that we are in this mess It's up to congress press and us to not let up TAX RET RUSS CONN ELECT DEMS
Yep and they spent $400,000 on Obama for an hour!!!! Crazy huh?
All of U people defending her and vilifying GOP and election forget you had the last 8 years and half the country wants a change.Tolerance?
Lets not forget that your hero obama is giving speeches to wall  street for 400 k , bribe ?
No!
@bmambwe2001 Shame upon @POTUS 
Keep your mind on the important things, the crap Trump and his cronies are trying to do and accomplishing. Never mind FORMER POTUS OBAMA!!
You didn't pass it, you made a mess and loads of buracracies
guess thats why obama gets 400 thousand an hr speaking for them something more is there
They will kill it Senator. Human decency, foresight, kindness..it's all dead. Trump is destroying the very core of any morality we had left.
I Bought Your Book Today To Let you know TRUMP is A National Disgrace ! We Must Stand Up Against Bigoted Misogynistic Republicans
You did say you were upset over Obama's speech for Wall Street Right? Just making sure I saw that and didn't make it up
Fight them, for the sake of every retirement fund and college fund in America. We Are With You!
Maybe your BFF Obama could step in and help out considering they are paying him 400K and hour now.
Reforms did nothing but cost Americans their hard earned cash which went to Hillary & Dems to fund election campaign
Keep fighting the good fight @SenWarren
Excuse me, don't U mean Ur famous BAIL OUT BILLS? Such Hypocrites!
yes you passed it and growth never topped 2.5% since. Good job.
And they are back to paying Obama. What is he doing behind the scenes?
Well criminals will always seek to repeal the laws
Good get rid of bad legislation.
Now Wall St is paying Obama $400K.
and we had a communist running this country
She didn't say anything to @HillaryClinton...Maybe she trying to T her book up or something..
Yet no one went to jail, not the rate fixers, not the people that sold one thing while betting on it to fail, not the mortgage companies..
How much did Wall Street pay Clinton for his and her speeches and now Obama
Thank you, Senator Warren, for your leadership. Keep after them! #WallStreet
And then you gave them billions of dollars.
Next thing ya know SEC will impose Congressional oversight upon themselves....without the ability to filibuster..exposure is a bee-otch...
And guess what @BarackObama got paid $400k x2- backpayments for never indicting a single person on Wall St. What good are toothless reforms?
How much did they pay limp wristed Obama this week!
It's killing the industry and putting the millions of middle class families who rely on the jobs and returns at grave risk. Or don't u care?
you got donations from Wall Street lawyers who represent the banks! You are part of the problem.
Ridiculously foolish kid
We need term limits for people like you
Apologise for what you said about Obama. I'm so disappointed in you.
If Democrats did it probably needs reversed
There going to give half of that to Obama!
Your such a liar just like Obama and Hilary.
y aren't u and the dems speaking out against the thugs silencing freedom of speech 
They are part of the pack? Behind the scenes?
With a money hungry president and republicans in control of congress, Probably will happen
And they gave Barry O $400k. Little upset Pocahontas? Or not because a fellow lib? Prob not, wondering how you can get that?
Didn't meet your min payoff huh Liz? How much will you take to change your votes?
IMPEACH INCARCERATE ILLEGITIMATE PENCE CABINET ADMINISTRATION GOP REP GUILANI GINSBURG ALL I MENTIONED TRAITORS
Outrageous.

Obama $400,000 speeches. Must have done a few favors?
I love you Liz, but I you were wrong to criticize Obama for taking $ from Wall Street. He is a great speaker and clearly ethical.
Of course. Goldman Sachs owns the nation, de-frauded nation and yet WHERE ARE THE PEOPLE, LIKE BLANKFEIN IN JAIL?
It will not cost nearly that much to kill it this time.
Keep fighting for us
'08 crisis was because democrats forced risky loans.
DO you ever work, or only tweet?
We need #trumprussia investigation. It is not business as usual until that is done with independent prosecutor
They have no shame or care but the real issue is the constituents that keep electing these .  How do we change their view??
Keep up good work Elizabeth
Your reform, left fewer bigger banks creating a larger risk of failure.
OBAMA on board now that hes a wall street fat cat, you probably next after your next election
Would that be the wall street that just gave Obama 400,000 $ for a one hour speech?
I actually dont think Obama should take all that money. Then again, I dont think we should be paying for 45 to golf every weekend either
@SenWarren I know your voice will remain strong in addressing financial reform as @HouseGOP attack the reforms. Thank you.
Haha that's a quarter of what you got "teaching " speaking Bullshit a class. Clown
Never crossed you mind that it might have hurt more than it helped I suppose?
the how  come wall st is doing so well you marxist thug
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump We also miss him having his old life: Someone PLEASE give him his old life back already!
Keep persisting @SenWarren never give up the fight!
Bad democrat policies of everyone regardless of income or credit should be able to buy a luxury home was the problem
Keep fighting Liz!
Building a house of cards for quick gain with no regard for the long term impact. GOP doesn't care about America, only their party!!
Back your President while your at it!
Garbage.Obama had ban on derivitives which caused the financial meltdown removed frm the bill as favor to Wall St,Warren/Dems went along
We are also spending 1 mil a day to house the president and his mail order bride. So he can play golf
Sounds like Wall Street is opting to pay Obama $400k for a speech instead! You must be so proud Lizzie!
It was only one president ago that those Wall Street crazies almost destroyed this country, and now Trump wants to give them carte blanche.
@BarackObama is now being paid by them. Your such a DA
@SenWarren...THANK U 4 EVERYTHING U DO ON A DAILY BASIS 2 TRY & RID US OF THIS EMBARRASSMENT! #NULLIFYTHEELECTION #INDEPENDENTINVESTIGATION
And even more trying to get you buddy Hillary elected
Ya, it has to be SMART reform. That's the thing.
So how did you get that $5 Million in donations?
Who are you turning tricks for now?
Let them give obama his 400k first
To line their pockets &favors 4 WH mob. Not America first with them.Taxpayers last Congress &WH mob first as usual.Make ourselves rich first
because banks stocks and investors didn't syphon enough of the  public's money. Second round - be prudent, the banks are predatory
Don't let them...keep up the good fight
You guys are such hypocrites! obama is a snake!
Cheetos tainted face moron was right! He was going to b "unpresidented"!...most incompetent admin in history of wold! What sad, sad loser! 
Is that what obama is speaking on? Hahahaha
What a total dunce ignorant about finance economics and of course common sense
I wonder how many @BarackObama speeches to Wall Street that would be?  He was the one who hired you!
So Y do us DEMs fail so badly at getting that message out to the masses. Faux fiscal conservatives destroy the Economy.
They probably only spent $600,000 the other $400,000 went to Barack Obama remember
Guess it's nice to have money to burn.
Wall Street needs some speeches from you @senwarren to understand how we get capitalism back on track working 4 the Middle Class
Until the mid-90ies Senator Warren was a registered Republican, then she figured out they are fiscally irresponsible in practice
After decades of mostly Repub Governors CA finally has a surplus in the budget under Dem Jerry Brown's fiscally responsible budgets
Thank god!
The hypocrisy is staggering. Please keep fighting the good fight, Senator! #resist
Wall St. is spending some BIG bucks for your hero Obummer...Killary is 2nd fiddle now.. comical....
Please run in 2020. You'll get squashed like a bug. 
Pocohantas
And all you did was kill off community banking.  What should be killed now is Dodd-Frank and bring back Glass–Steagall.  #BrainlessInDC
And we spent billions bailing out the mess they made. Now they want to roll back the rules put in place to prevent from doing it again #maga
It is so sad they just can't leave things alone.  Can they work on the serious issues facing this country right now.  Treason possible war
They should have spent more and done whatever it takes to keep the bankrupt federal government from managing their industry
Stop them
They are stubbornly cutting off their own noses to spite their faces.... Rule #1..don't defecate where you eat.  We the People matter..
Keep fighting the thieves.
Hurts small borrowing and small community banks and credit unions.
Keep fighting Senator. We have your back. More letters and phone calls. Thanks!
We can't let history repeat itself. Saying that you should step down. Just another senator  getting richer in office
And probably collecting at least a million a day #Kleptocracy #TheResistance
Obama just got a 400,000 payday from Wall Street!
It's all about the money.
Bingo ! Play the game to succeed, don't resist.
GOP trying to kill it then I'm all for it much more than you've ever done but b**** b**** b****
Sell your bill props instead of loser mentality blabs. Criticsm will attract flies not honey bees. LEARN!
We need glass steagall back. Removing it was one of the many mistakes from the Clinton era.
Could some one make a simple graph that shows what happens every time they do this. Increasing debt, screwing the people.
And you all voted to bail them out with our money.
Thanks to you,staying on top of the fools in DC, we can hopefully avoid sliding all the way back.Thank you for your tenacity and good heart.
So is the GOP goal to go back to the 08 financial crisis?
No, the new crisis will be much better. Many people say so. Believe me! It's gonna be the BIGLIEST crisis. Better than the Great Depression!
His taxes and investments tell the story of who trump really represents. Investigate and impeach.
The middle class
Keep up the good work
No matter how many billions they have it will never be enough. What would or could they do with it all?
money has time, while poverty is impatient . . .
Maybe if we had never bailed them out to begin with we wouldn't be here now?
It would have been a nasty crash, but if we enable them again the next one will be much worse. And we are dissolving the social safety net 
I know it would have been nasty, but it would have at least made an impression on the banks. Golden parachutes didn't help.
I'm not sure what the answer is. Every time they blow the economy up, the next implosion is bigger. I was hopeful Dodd Frnk would help prvnt
Dodd Frank is nothing but buracracies, it does nothing to fix. Liabilities need to be restored that df put in to remove
Bailout would have been better served by issuing every American between 21 and 65 a debit card with 1k to only be spent on American products
Maybe. I'm not sure that would have unfrozen credit markets though.
A massive circulation of a government issued credit through the banking organizations via debit cards? It would have lit a fire
The @Gop Are not even HUMAN
Pass a law to law speeches at a much higher rate. Obama $400k a speech?  Tax him
That cuz Trump & top 1% will benefit
Obama is now part of the 1% how does that make you feel
Tbh I believe they should & can afford to pay more taxes than the wrkin middle class & poor. WHY rob Peter 2 pay Paul? How dose that #MAGA
Whatever happened to getting off your ass and making your own fortune that's what used to make this country so great
My question exactly. But how many ppl u see willing 2 do back breaking 12-16hrs of work every single day.
I do every day I live in one of the small farm communities where they're taking over
lol that's less than half what hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer gave to Trump inauguration
Now they're paying Obama $400k for speaking
lol that's less than half what hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer gave to Trump inauguration
Barry is just getting started he'll beat Trump on funds received..
Trump  is on track, yup..
Obama spent 8 yrs condemning wall street, now he is getting paid to endorse it
Those guys are truly lap dogs for the wealthy
No pressure, but us reasonable people are counting on our voices in D.C., like yours!
#resist
#Obamacare is dying, and you know it!
They spent 400k on Barry Obama too
