will the Republicans ever be willing to put this country before thier party?
Hmmm, the irony. I'm guessing you want some form a socialism instead of individualism.
SHUT UP Elizabeth! Trump administration is leading this nation back to prosperity. You want poverty.
Crazy how Hillary Clinton managed to arrange the sell of uranium to Russia. Be consistent and FAIR
this tells you something about Trump & all of his nominees He wants to be a dictator & learn from Putin
Hillary had close ties to Russia. Podesta had closer ties. Obama had ties with Russia.What's the problem?
. Team up with Rep. Marci Kaptur (Ohio). You two are unstoppable.
Thank you for the updates and for standing up for our rights and what's right!
When will this investigation start? Close ties w. Putin https://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html …
And you have ties to someone who broke the law and destroyed the evidence!
@CNNPolitics why hasn't anyone asked trump about Russian missile launch yesterday?? @realDonaldTrump

Alveda King accuses Sen. Warren of 'playing the race card'  http://video.foxnews.com/v/5318411712001/ …

Team up
Publish proof please. We need to see absolute proof because we don't trust your word anymore.
He's secretary of state... he's supposed to have close ties with a number of foreign officials...
Will improved relations w/Russia lead to war? If so will you shoulder a rifle? Or will any elite?
Ross is a crook and should never have been considered for post, much less confirmed.
What's your point? Y r u demonizing Russia? There is no more Cold War.

where did you find that list? I want to read it.
I assembled the list from several articles from the WSJ, NYT, and Wash Post.
okay I will check it out
If I have time later, I'll try to find the articles again. Fascinating reading.
okay thanks
Not articles I read, but good summary of some on list.
Lots of articles on Tillerson. Here's one.
Hillary Clinton while Secretary of State had an illegal unsecured email server and lied about it under oath
your McCarthyism is amusing. #VoteOutDemocrats
follow the OIL...to TREASON Tillerson makes deal w/Russia..sanctions are lifted...Crimea..Ukrainian oil?
please save our government
please do something. Tweeting to the people does nothing. As the election showed, we the people have no power. #popularvote
we must investigate 45 and administration
Prosecute them all!
It's time for an independent investigation! @StateDept @CommerceGov
will steps be taken for a total investigation?
Wow, the trolls really don't like strong women who speak up, but apparently don't mind Russia undermining US democracy. Curious.
rex got rusk award..go rex go vlad go T
@Sharmisha14 @StateDept @CommerceGov at this point if Tillerson offers Putin a tissue after he sneezes I'll be suspicious
Rex isn't a Russian stooge. He was just trying to do business in a stable part of the world. I'd trust him over Trump.
keep fighting - get hacked election tossed out!
how about Sessions? He's also compromised.
in all the madness/distraction this is really important thanks
pulled dodd frank provision to report money signed hr res 41 After Trump sign SEC not enforce or reissue?
We demand more information!  We demand transparency!  We demand taxes to be released! Who is this pres?
Can Congress or anyone or anything make him show his taxes to us?!
What is this love for Putin? Strictly oil?

.@SenWarren THANK YOU for talking about this!
It's become clear that our executive is in partnership with Russia. No one planned for this, did they?
- and what are your plans to get to the bottom of these claims?? And what will be done? #NOINACTION
Putin no longer needs his operative Flynn in the White House, now he has Tillerson.
yea I'm done caring call me whatever

The GOP enabled
Trump to pursue his Russian fantasy...They knew damn well what they were
doing
Tillerson should have to resign or at least he also should be investigated along with Trump.
Everyone that Trump put in his cabinet that has ties to Putin/Russia like Tillerson should have to resign
NEWS Flash: You know who has close ties to Russia financially, The Clinton's. Spend time cleaning ur hous
the reason all the anti-corruption measures are being erased. Snakes in the grass.
--- @HillaryClinton sold uranium to Putin. What's your point.
Putin! Putin! Putin! Putin! Putin! Putin! Get some damn Gas-Ex!
They should be investigated too.
Trump is dirty beyond dirty
And I bet if we saw Trumps tax returns he'd be connected also, must ask for tax returns now.
Yep! Pretty obvious Putin's put his pawns in place. Go get 'em Queen! Checkmate time!
i must read up on that I'm in the dark
As long as you are not one of them, I would be okay if Massachusetts has three Senators.
So take this info and DO SOMETHING with it!
Whenever Tillerson & Putin are together, affinity for one another isn't contained/hidden. $$$
@Lee_in_Iowa @StateDept @CommerceGov if one GOP try to confirm another Trump pick have them arrested! Immediately
@Lee_in_Iowa @StateDept @CommerceGov And our GOPers just let it all happen. Why is that?
Most effective massive infiltration by one country of another. Trump right. Putin clever.
Jared Kushner, Paul manafort, Flynn, all the Trump family. The list is long. The ties are deep
Putin’s yacht is coming by to pick them up… http://www.cbsnews.com/news/russian-spy-ship-patrolling-off-u-s-east-coast/# …
These TRAITORS are linked together like a merry-go-round dance!!
.@SenWarren common factoreverwhere: Russia
why dont you tell us about you "close ties" to banking and your little mortgage scheme?
This administration is corrupt Drain the swamp #ImpeachTrump
So obvious to ave citizen. Anyone stopping investigation looks suspect.
are Syrian refugees or Russian Government. The greatest threat?
Washington has become Moscow West
.  I am worried about Tillerson.

@senrobportman @senrobportman We know this so why are we letting this happen?
WIth your, HRC and Obama's tacit approval, the leftist protestors & anarchists against Trump will lead to a Revolution!
And the LIST gets bigger!!! I'm beginning 2 believe the Bible - someone will rise up...PUTIN
And yet, R's will try to quash any investigation. Party over Country.
yup.
First domino down...... #russiagate #BigOil
@TokyoRosa @StateDept @CommerceGov We knew, but they got in anyway! Organize better, Dems!
Voters were decimated by CrossCheck and other republican-led voter disenfranchisement efforts. Also fraud in WI et al
@CameronLloyd02 @StateDept @CommerceGov yeah this president has filled his cabinet with the creatures of the black lagoon. SAD !
Jealous. You thought all of the marxists were YOUR friends. Self-righteous and wrong.
@Fydsy @StateDept @CommerceGov agree Hillary was just best buddies with Saudi's. Who believe in killing innocent ppl.
She's hardly alone in that - almost every politician bar Corbyn & Hamon are.
that's correct.
I hate west politicians sucking up to them. They created wahabi terrorism.
Yes they did. The best way to deal with them is for the world to wean itself off oil.
Yup. This Russia thing is ludicrous considering how many elections CIA hv rigged world over. 
Ludicrous in some sense, but still important.
information is new age weapon. Russians r using it as do US. They must focus on main issue. China.
Hmm - dodgy thinking in my book.
@CommerceGovand you have close ties to a corrupt politician who used her influenceto gain money from foreign countries
check obama and clinton ties to ISIS. or do not care?
oh look now they r all mad about the Ukraine.
Trump so proud of his Drain The Swamp slogan. HIS CABINET IS THE REAL SWAMP! We need  to DRAIN IT NOW!
What about Donald Trump? Anyone seen his tax returns yet?
What are y'all doing about it? You KNOW that they are ALL GUILTY!
@menjicm @StateDept @CommerceGov INVESTIGATION sounds appropriate!
why is there not an investigation going on? Hire a pi
This whole Admin, including Pence and Ryan, needs to be investigated. It's almost treason NOT to.
The KGB is da house!
Senator:As a fellow progressive please don't allow personal animus to lead US into new McCarthyarism
Proof of these accusations is forthcoming. Don't hold your breath.
Trump adores Putin, think there's a common thread here?
It  needs that spotlight at all times, you are the one to do it. You get under his skin like no one else
TY for all you do in this regard senator @SenWarren .
Republicans in congress are obstructing investigations, america wants answers abt Trump n Putin
So let's get rid of them.
Thank you for publicizing this.
@connie_bergman @StateDept @CommerceGov so where's the investigation. If it was Hillary they would have had 5 already
Chaffetz won't do his job and needs to be replaced for not doing his job.
he's a joke
Indeed!  the entire Trump staff & cabinet are dirty. Time to do some laundry!  Use bleach!


FACTS of #TrumpRussia in #DworkinReport on @funder & Trump,Putin,Russia on @Khanoisseur & @LouiseMensch
@SpeakerRyan - Republicans should be ashamed - you have colluded in this pro-Russia agenda!
yes, Trump and his whole cesspool need to be investigated and brought to justice!
People who are more interested in defeating the other party more than they work to defeat ISIS, are morally bankrupt.
Uh huh, and what else @SenWarren? @StateDept @CommerceGov
Why did the Senate approve them?
Because a bunch of amoral greedheads calling themselves the GOP control the chamber.
Very true, but what goes around comes around.
Also globally known trumps have Russian business interest including J. kushner. The REP.corruptions thick
Lock them up.
They all do. Follow the money 
Rex T still has Exxon stock Doesn't take a genius 2 figure stuff out here impeach DT now
The draining of the swamp has officially begun!!!
@mehrddad_88 Sen Warren has close ties to idiots.
she supported #HillaryClinton, so is a good woman
@NoShock @StateDept @CommerceGov Get him gone.
Keep digging, more garbage to be revealed!!!
What are you doing to flush out the rest of these jokers?
these people will as well be exposed and will have to resign as well.   To God be the Glory
If they are all tied to Putin he might as well be sitting in the White House.
Flynn. Tillerson. Trump. Birds of feather, flock together...around Putin. #RESISTANCE #VoteOutGOP
stifle, you sow
Sanctions can't be removed w/o Ryan and McConnell, they are guilty too. Complicit in Rump election, etc..
They all do. Rosneft 19.5% to DT & friends. That's a lot of incentive to remove sanctions, Ryan McConnell
investigate! Keep up the pressure
All getting wealthy from 19.5% Rosneft deal, shell Co owned by Rump longtime friend Schwartzman @maddow
The Russians are Coming, The Russians are Coming !!!!
all of them! The country must be returned to control of Democratic party. Repub complicit in treason

#DJTYoudirtybird stop the cacka doody tweets #notfitforoffice #resist

So who leads an investigation and is one being conducted?  Serious question.
demand a review. Bust these thugs
Trump knew who he needed to put in his cabinet with ties to Putin. This was planned from day one.
Trump administration is badly tainted! We need full investigation and speedy impeachments!
@crhousel @StateDept @CommerceGov what's the hold up????? They are all obviously guilty of committing treason!
#WhosNext

You go Girl, Senator. #GetEmAll #DonaldTrumpShowUsYourTaxes
@GetBZLiving @StateDept @CommerceGov They are all guilty. They were trying 2 turn this country into a depressed USSR Steal & Rule

It seems we have elected a Russian takeover of our democracy.
The WH has become an extension of the Kremlin.
Just sayin'...
No surprise here!
