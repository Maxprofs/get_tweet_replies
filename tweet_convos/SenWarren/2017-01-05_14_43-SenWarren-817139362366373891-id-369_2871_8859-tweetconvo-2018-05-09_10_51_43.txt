Well how about the rest of us, we don't count?
BS- every American is and every American has 4th amendment rights that need protecting
True immigrants should be protected, not repeat illegals. Period
Good. She can also include gun rights groups, conservatives, IRS targeting other 'deplorables'...
but it's ok to spy on the general American public.
please explain Norway deportation of Syrians as many were connected to jihad and the clueless approach is scary
@PortiaABoulger @CoryBooker Integrity abounds
For fuck's sake, just shut up.  Stop being triggered and go have a beer.
here ye here ye, we the people will not tolerate these verbal or acted upon translations of justice!
oh so they can only do it to law abiding U.S. citizens?  What Hypocrisy!!
tell Cory to BLOCK TILLERSON!!!! thank you
how about the same law for legal law abiding citizens ?
agree, but enforce the laws, rules, etc., of this land. Both parties fall well short.
NO spying on a potential threat is necessary get real get out of your safe place bubble maybe you should bein britain
No one cares,  go away  Pochantas. 
doesn't have a chance in hell of going anywhere!!!
Thank you for cosponsoring this bill.  My immigrant parents have experienced "registration" already. It went badly.
Thank you, dear good and responsible senators.
citizens are being killed/raped by those being brought in, use commonsense in the citizens' favor, U R representing
Thank you!
Can't imagine any negative consequences flowing from THIS.
1) So no Surveillance. But  yes 2 Big Pharma Corporate Greed 4 Mr. Booker, who voted "Nay" to Amend on lowering cost
Hood luck with that sunshine
You mean old racist Cory Booker? The dude who hates white America, but loves minorities, Indians too?
@scootercla68 @CoryBooker @washingtonpost Oh..FFS...Go away. Lunatic.

FABULOUS!
@84stillcounting @CoryBooker @washingtonpost thank you! Want to see more if this young man
You mean the way they signed the petitions from the House? Please refund my donations.

@ThePlumLineGS Once you endorsed Clinton, not Sanders, you revealed your true colors! #Loser
wasting your time Pocohontis! Indians aren't illegal immigrants!
@ThePlumLineGS what about US citizens?
are you just plain nuts, we need to vent all immigrants, unlike democrats, need to keep safe.
that's what I'm talking about somebody in Washington it's really working, not just repeating slogans
more Warren bull shit
Where were you when the water cannons fired Lizzy?
Another moronic bill sponsored by our faux Indian senator
you are a coward. Thanks for nothing yesterday. Unfollowed
or maybe you could all work together because there is a clear problem with islam's view of society
Especially Native Americans. Right.... E.....
As one of your constituents, I appreciate and support this action!
so we can't vet them and can't follow them to see if they are subversive... why are we risking this?
How about vetting them better.  We taxpayers are telling you no money for them, you listening yet?
you will not be re elected.
@ThePlumLineGS for real will you and Cory booker co take responsibility when people get killed by terrorists?
Go Senator Warren#CoryBookerBill. We need it. Good luck  on passage.
@ThePlumLineGS protects terrorists while people get killed by them
@ThePlumLineGS no tweet to console the people that got killed yesterday because of weak politicians not protecting us
@ThePlumLineGS how many people have to die before you stop politicizing things your your own personal benefit
@ThePlumLineGS several hours after this tweet 5 dead in Isis attack
TERM LIMITS  TERM LIMITS  TERM LIMITS  TERM LIMITS  TERM LIMITS  TERM LIMITS   TERM LIMITS  TERM LIMITS
@ThePlumLineGS will you co take responsibility when people get killed by Islamic terrorists?
Everybody on both sides, should B outraged that Congress threatens SS & Medicare, but find money 4 illegals defense,
Taxpyers demand term limits in congress.n  We will B watching your vote.  Career politicians have made a mess. Enough
Senator, not thrilled that U waste taxes 2 protect illegals. Where in your oath did U pledge 2 protect  invaders?
Yes we must not fall asleep  now. Boil your eggs the way you like them, but prez elect cant fly on his own words.
@ThePlumLineGS Isis would cosponsor too. Because they take advantage of your good intentions/political opportunism
@ThePlumLineGS those people that got killed yesterday is because of you and bills like this
@ThePlumLineGS great that you announce this and a terrorist goes and kills people in Florida isiot
@ThePlumLineGS oh good idea because Muslims aren't killing Americans every day
@ThePlumLineGS if you think refugees are so great let them live in your house
Why don't you do something for the country instead of the DNC?  For that matter, whats been done at all?  HACKS
WHO is investigating whether pres-elect KNEW about Rus interference. Aid and comfort = treason
@kegley_andy @CoryBooker @washingtonpost Good luck with that! #RedNationRising
Russia hacking. Trump's conflicts of interest. The PEOTUS has the stink of collusion - and it will overlay everything
Then why didn't you stand with the reps against 50 illegal electors that made him prez?
Sen. stop Session or we'll be back in Jim Crow era!!

Thank you.
#AMEN--THE #CORRECT #POSITION!!
the silence today was not okay.  Not at all.
First thing we must reject his being sworn-in as president
PUTINs Russian plant -not even a good liar
Same .@SenWarren who said it's morally wrong obscene to profit from student loans, charged $400,000.00 to teach one course at Harvard .@cnn
object to electoral college votes! They are corrupt and anti American. Vote against EC votes.
Way to go Senator.We MUST believe that there is a scientific truth that there's ONE #HUMANRACE in the world.
How about the rest of the populace?
RESIST
Thank you Elizabeth. Everything you do for us is so tight on.
Is that Legal or ILLEGAL immigrant groups,  Senator?  Knowing you? Probably ILLEGALS.
@braaaaiiinnns @CoryBooker @washingtonpost Your honey do list will be long for next 4 years. #StayVigilant #StayStrong. Thank you
are you sure you are an American. Move to n.Korea. you belong there
that's really important. No wonder gov is so screwed up
The reason why the Russians were celebrating the win of trumo is because they got it done
I think you should open a bill to investigate this
This seems like a bad idea.  A really really bad idea
THE ONLY HARASSMENT IS COMING FROM LEFT-WING HATE TRUMP CRIMES
@citizenjo @MoveOn STOP Anti-Hate Trump CRIMES
https://twitter.com/PrisonPlanet/status/816256938077982720 …

WARREN SAID," DIDN'T SEND HER TO WH TO PLAY DEAD. SHE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT 2020. Pocahontas thinks she's an Indian.  not that desperate 

@elizabethforma  NOT THIS desperate. Pocahontas has high cheekbones. She thinks she a Indian. Can you say cuckoo https://twitter.com/Allthatjewelry/status/817482743756058624 …
@realDonaldTrump 

LETS VOTE WARREN OUT OF OFFICE... SHE'S A NUT CASE!
you and the rest of the democraps failed at the working class
@MaxineWaters asked for one just one Senator to stand up and defend the integrity of our elections. Where were you @SenWarren ??? #NoLeader
Nothing but a loser....why can't you go away Hiawatha and leave all of us the hell alone?  Sickening just like Hill
Destined for failure.
LOL. That's going nowhere.
not a good idea Ms. Warren
So proud of our Senator Warren
Rep Maxine Waters needed ONE senator today to object re EC vote...where were you both??
Why didn't you block the Electoral College vote? 50 illegal! Democrats get tougher!
just tell me what you need me to do!
Good Luck Booker has NO follow through
why did they harass your Indian ass?
WHY DID YOU NOT STAND WITH HOUSE DEMS TODAY????
why would you not second the objections to electoral college certification?  Waste of your time?
Fraud 1 and 2.
for the love of God please sign the objection. They are on N!!!
time to show @GOP who's boss. How dare they mess with the rights of the U.S. People!
Thank you, Senator, for all you're doing. America is lucky to have you!
You already do and the NSA and CIA and FBI will never stop no matter the law
You are my heroes!

thank you both
THANK YOU for fighting for equality and justice. I'm proud to be represented by you, @SenWarren.
Great - now what can we do besides introduce legislation that will just die on the chamber floor?
How about Native Americans? Democrats import immigrants to steal more land from Americans and destroy the environment
Too bad Mr. booker doesn't find Israel's Ethnic Cleansing of Palestinians disturbing too!
if they "could" be a threat (radical islaam) then u must do it, that's putting Americans first!!
thank you!
Elizabeth Warren Goes to Senate Floor, Asks Americans to RESIST, PLEASE SUPPORT http://www.learnprogress.org/elizabeth-warren-resist-republicans/?bt_alias=eyJ1c2VySWQiOiAiNjg1Y2NjOGItYzZhZS00NTNhLTgzMDctOGY2YTMxYzhkZDI3In0%3D …

@suefulton @CoryBooker @washingtonpost bravo

ah, I think that is already law in the USA!!!
go get Fauxcahontas! Oh, Dems are so irrelevant.
funny how those democrats scream loud wanting to help illegals but not one wants to live near them!
why don't u gather up illegals and moved them all to warren's mansions!
It's a waste of time and energy. Trump will veto
.@SenWarren @CoryBooker @washingtonpost Glad to hear it! I am surprised @RandPaul is not also a sponsor. We need to curtail surveillance.
You currently watch every American right now via satellite, computers, phones and smart devices?
what can I do to help?
@babsiemay #IRS #Veterans #Education #Law 99% Message to NRA TeaParty Drumpf/Pence/Ryan BS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q-ZyW9bz5c …

In time of war or at least when safety is at risk there has yo be measures.
Thank you @SenWarren @CoryBooker !
how about everybody else in America or Russia
HOPELESS POLITITIONS
thank you Elizabeth Warren
.@SenWarren Dem policies led to destruction of black community in Detroit + others. The resentment Dems cause led to Chicago torture video.
and those suspected of traitorous activity.
illegal immigrants.  Get your facts straight.
And this is why we love Senator Warren.
why blind eye to crosscheck . Russian hacking smokescreen for crosscheck the real voter fraud .
@SenSanders Bernie this is a Senator taking action! Learn from her and help your country!
Thank you.
Warren-Booker 2020!!! (Or Booker-Warren, either way works)
Donald Trump has a phone and a pen as well...Does this ever cross your mind?
what about Americans safety.  You need to be voted out.
GOP better STOP this madness. American Disgrace 2 target specific religions. GOP proving they R radical white racists
The anti-surveillance piece is great!  Can you work to apply to this to American citizens as well?
Bill is called "AMERICA"! We R not Nazi Germany. What's next 4 GOP&Trump Hitler salute, tattooed arms, gas chambers?
ok
surveillance is ok for all people within USA
A nation is grateful for your standing against this threat to all Americans!
I thought the IRS was already going after conservative groups
