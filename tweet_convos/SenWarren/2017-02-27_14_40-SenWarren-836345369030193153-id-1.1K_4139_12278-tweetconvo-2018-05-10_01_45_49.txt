Wilbur Ross has shady ties to Russia, serious business conflicts, & a history of cheating people out of their homes.
For any and all these reasons, today I urged my colleagues to vote NO on Wilbur Ross for @CommerceGov.
Thank you Senator Warren.
how many millionaires working for you consumer protection agency scam? Making 250k a year , blackmailing companies
precisely!!!!
Bank of Cyprus- Donald Trump house sale in Fla to owner of Bank etc. Etc.
LOL this says zero about anything.... is this drivel supposed to be evidence of some sort? Lol
Perhaps this drivel will mean something to you if you look into it a bit instead.
LOL no you haven't looked into it enough!
You are assuming, therefore you perhaps are not aware of the owner's of the bank ties
to the current Commerce Secretary and all his Russian oligarch pals that lead to Trump
Every iPhone in Russia is a CIA mic, but Russian ties&hacking is the problem? #vault7
why are you changing the subject, deflecting?
And @SenWarren you are practically a cartoon of a self righteous know nothing  @morningmika @CommerceGov
and you are a bobble head similar to all the other Democrats in Congress. Agreeing with all the lobbyists
Senator Warren, what have you done? All you do is bobble your head and screechingly complain.
I worked for ISG, He saved our jobs, and he treated us very well.He actually had Union and company working together
brilliant ... thank you
@OccupyWallStNYC @CommerceGov why did u say u was Indian? U ain't from India! U ain't even got no damn qualications anyway!
really, I could use some help, can you help me?
Wall Street supported Hillary and that's needing an investigation
is this your best shot??
72-27 suggests your colleagues were in favor. How much were they paid to go along with it? #InvestigatePlease
He sounds and looks like a Dysney Elmer Fudd
@morningmika @CommerceGov What tribe was it you belong to again? You haven't any credibility.
and who's interest did you have in kind when claiming to be Native American? Haven't apology or reparations.
r u talking about urself again pocohantas, FAKE one
Keep on persisting Senator!  #TheResistance
I wonder whether Wilbur Ross or you will draw more from federal government. my bet is you
@morningmika @CommerceGov even your retweets reveal your influence bias.
So says the person who lied about being an Indian to get a job.  You suck at this.  Delete your acct
@funder @CommerceGov He's also got questionable ties to Russia as the largest share holder of Bank of Cypress
Me name is Gina and I speek good Anglish...
@morningmika @CommerceGov
And Obam as,  Soros, Bill Ayers, and probably Hillary too in the housing fall.  Set it up the whole thing, follow $$

Another Democrat with sand in his vagina.....LoL....

More alligators to fill the swamp.
. That's why he was selected, silly girl.
Well you think you're in Indian, so...
U are a cartoon of an #indian.  #russia? I think an investigation needs to be done on the #dems real Russia story
A LOT SMARTER THAN YOU.
Like you and every democrat right?
welcome back Senator! I miss you. Thanks for all you do
glad you are able to describe yourself perfectly
Here's another 
if wealth is a disqualifier why is Warren so crediable.
One more:
who know how to incur commerce and help spur economic growth and jobs! You are clueless Senator! #defeatwarren2018
@morningmika @CommerceGov I cannot believe this guy was confirmed. Sigh. Big sigh.
Speaking of cartoons 
don't confirm him.
You're a broken record @SenWarren. Six months of accusations and not the first damn reciept! Not even a lil kremlin 7-11  @CommerceGov
But he’ll still be confirmed. You’re such a loser, Liz.
@ShellyKennisto1 @SenWarren Pocahontas is crooked as hell
Warren you falsified papers to get into Harvard! You helped pass Obama Care a Disaster & Fraud..Who is the Fat Cat?
To be clear Sen Warren falsified papers to get into George Washington U. a double WhammyTaxpayers Cost $$$! Ret$$$
Pretty Sick that Warren is in the Senate taking our hard earned $$$$$.Fire her now@JudgeJeanine @AmyMek @Dbargen
Pass the borscht comrades TrumpRussia
#OverflowTheSwamp
no one in his cabinet cares about anyone but themselves.. So self serving..
You should watch Maddow's report from last night. It's worse than that. #Trumprussia #treason #resist
you speak with partisan forked tongue.
you should talk what's your net worth?
hers is nothing compared to Wilbur Ross & the rest of the cabinet. Do you have problems with theirs?
Isn't it hypocrisy that you're worth MUCH more than ave American on a Senator's salary of $174k? Self-interest, narcissist much?
is worth every penny. She shows up, speaks up, and works tirelessly day & night for her constituents.
@morningmika @CommerceGov lov u Sen Warren I wish u would come to central Florida and speak. Keep up the good work for us.
Wall Street finances who they think will win. They were with Hillary first! Did you forget?? The mind is the first.
Democrats confirmed him. what the fuck. @SenWarren @CommerceGov #WilburRoss #ResistTrump
I love this honest commentary
Can't you do something productive to earn your paycheck?
Would this be like accusing Pocahontas of doing what needed to be done to land the university job?
I expect better from my US Senator than juvenile name calling.  Very disappointed.
from a cartoon indian.
And another!
you want some cheese to go with whine, Pocahontas??
why are all of orange-clown's his picks rich af and old as hell??
Shouldn't people have the right to defend what then believe in? That's the American way.
How do you feel about Warren being worth $15m on a 700k salary? charging $400k to teach 1 class in 'over priced schooling'?
Pow Wow
Goodness you are such a hysterical senior citizen!
deconstruction of the administrative state.
@TrialHumor2 @CommerceGov Practically? He IS a loathsome fat cat interested only in self enrichment.
Ask him about his little connection to Russia via Cyprus.
If GOP cuts the top tax rates again, shrinks social income supports > nose dive 2 Pre Obama recession w/i 90 days
And you Warren are a lier!  You have not one ounce of American Indian blood in your body ! I am offended !
He'll fit right in with Trump and friends.
you have some bad hombres on the blue side
and PRINCESS POCA LIZ  is also a cartoon stereotype.....big mouth no brains
Do not confirm Wilbur Ross!
How did you become a millionaire?
That tweet reminds me of you!
So what's new in this administration? We need to get rid of them all.
Russian connection another traitor in the White House investigate, impeach
Hey Lizzy...do you know ANY republicans who DONT have shady ties to Russia?
He'll fit right in w/the other deplorable's in Trump cabinet. Wonder if trump supporters know they've been screwed
Sounds very similar to you, Lizzy Warren, only a fat cat Senator.  BTW what's your net worth?
how much did Harvard pay you again?
How bout trumps taxes before we care about that?
You just described most of #45's Cabinet nominees.
but of course. The cabinet of evil zillionaires.
You use weird choice of words being in the position you are in. "Fat cat"? Words used in Ramsey case. WTH.
I agree but he does have #russian interests with the #bankofcyprus and his ownership.  See @maddow  from tonight.
@23_dross @CommerceGov KNOW MAN 40 YRS WONDERFUL MAN HUSBAND DAD KIDS 12 14 15 DEVASTATED WANT TO SEE HIM EVEN PRISON
Gee..that actually DESCRIBES YOU!!
@morningmika @CommerceGov #AncestryDNA will clear up your cartoon stereotype of a Native American impersonator
Are you kidding? What is your net worth? What are your interests...Lying & using the system to advance your career.
How much are you worth? How much were you worth before you became an elected official ??
More gators in the swamp. Good thing we got rid of the "elites" 
And of course no Russian ties to see here!...
well then, what a perfect choice to help round out the Reich
if he was self absorbed and only cared about himself he wouldn't take a job as a public servant and lower his pay.
and Hillary was owned by who -Saudi and multi millionaire and billionaire globalist -same who would enslave mid clas
With Russian ties as well... Not shocked but am outraged. This is no time for politics as usual.
well he'll fit right in! #resist #theswamp #TheResistance
@SenateDems no bottom to the depth of my contempt for Dems who voted with corrupt Repubs to confirm the Ross JOKE.
Do caricatures govern the country now? You grasped a cultural costume yourself for personal gains.
. Even as a Canadian I really admire you and your stance
@23_dross @CommerceGov BERNIE SANDERS TALKS SHIT ALL MAKE REAL REVOLUTION LEAD MARCH PROTEST AGAINST ALL STOP THEM.

@Lee_in_Iowa @CommerceGov No wonder @realDonaldTrump nominated him. He'll fit right in. 
President trump. warren will be history soon. YES
So stereotypes are OK now?  You liberals need to make up your minds.
U r our last chance.Keep up the good work.
Same as the president himself.  What a joke they r for working class people! Sad that working class believe them!
Why go practically when you can have actually...Hillary. You supported her and so Wall Street n Big Banks. Shame!!
Well then, he fits into Bannon's nefarious government-dissembling plan perfectly. Isn't that special.
sounds just like you with a big mouth. And nothing to say
A Fat Cat with a direct line to Putin, Cyprus bank & Russian Dirty Money laundering. #trumpRussia
and Democrats are political FatCats with no interest in anyone but their party?
He's worse than that.  Ties to Russia and Trump from the old days.  An indictment just waiting to happen.
Sounds like @realDonaldTrump
Liz Warren is a Looney Tunes cartoon of a Senator!
That's totally not bulling a man who has never done anything to you
plzzzzzz investigate Russia !!!!! Do not let this go !!!!!!
ohhhhh, another one confirmed
what would you call yourself?  A skinny rich cat?
Looney, rich, crazy ass Indian wannabe. .
Sounds like the perfect fit this administration, which isn't good for us!
for a person who does not like calling people names, you do it quite a bit yourself...
how did you amass $15 million net worth as a cartoon character
Keep fighting @SenWarren we need you!
but did he lie about his ethnicity to get a job?
You ra cartoon of a  wanna be north american indian. Stop your drivel and get out of Trump's way. Go play with Hil
You fabricate your nationality to get a position at Harvard and proceed to accomplish nothing in the Senate? Sad
so basically he's like 45?
heya heya heya heya
so explain to us again how your worth over 15 million on a salary of under 200k a year Liz? Hypocrisy
in line with our current president's character. Or lack there of.
That will make him a good fit for POTUS & most of his staff & other dep't picks then! 
He will fit right in unfortunately.
How did we get here? The 99% needs protections not exploitation. #shameful #Trumprussia
your correct you and Ross are the same let's all say No Fat Cat rich people
Confirmed!!
i agree miss warren vote no
you got that right!
hmmm...did the Clinton's have a class??  Kinda sounds like them huh?
just like Trump!
@realDonaldTrump Deutsche Bank money launderer/robber baron not unlike rest of Don's swamp cabinet
That statement helps.....
Listen to those vets who complained about your stupid endles rallies for refugees. Vets are priority!
Birds of a feather and all that
Funny, we think the same about u Pocohontus
You are SO hypocritical! I am embarrassed you represent Massachusetts 
okay can't help myself and this is different from Steve Bannon Rex Tillerson Betsy DeVos how?
Is he as big of a scammer as you spitting bull?
seems to fit the theme of WH Administration under Trump
what u politicians have done for middle class ? Wells Fargo CEO walked away with millions & U just kept talking.
I love what you say and how you say it!
Geezzz Liz how did your ranting speech go? Oh, LOST AGAIN! Back to your mansion!
Russia player in charge now. Way to go @GOP @SenateGOP
EXACTLY! As well as helping trumptaduduh purchase/sell $60M  on Florida MANSION from to Russian Trillionaire!
thanks for that Hiawatha!
has a $15 million net worth on a $174,000 senator's salary. You're a phony and a hypocrite.
that's Trump & his whole cabinet. Absolutely no regards for the poor and middle class. Only what's best for them.
@maddow Maybe more than that-maybe even lead in global blackmail & money laundering scheme with Russia?
#SWAMPSquid
so basically another tRump
You are practically a cartoon stereotype of a Native American. You made 400k to teach 1 college class, give me a break. #FakeNews
You've passed nothing viable in the senate, Baker has made you look incompetent while he gets things done. Don't run in 2018.
@morningmika @CommerceGov lol, YOU are the cartoon NUTCASE!!
