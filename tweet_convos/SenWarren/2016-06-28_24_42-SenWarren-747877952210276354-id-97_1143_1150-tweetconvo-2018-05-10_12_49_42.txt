@my_observation @DeptVetAffairs GOP has a special hate for veterans!
I agree, Bush starts a war and GOP follows it up with a cut to Vet Benefits, Aghh
GOP making a statement to veterans with every cut the make in our benefits! HATE
Why does the #GOP hate American vets, so?@SenWarren @DeptVetAffairs looking at you @AyotteNH
why do you not tell the truth and admit when the Dems had Congress they did little of nothing on this!
The GOP supports our troops... UNTIL they are no longer needed, apparently.  Just. Shameful. #supportourvets
And what do plan to do to help the vets who've served our country and have been injured? Nothing?
"Destroy"? Never mind, you're not serious.
@my_observation @DeptVetAffairs the GOP should look at what happen to the VA hospital in Maryland b/c of no maintenance funds S/D
@BeautyofDamon @DeptVetAffairs Thank you, Senator, for keeping it real and keeping us informed. That is real government! 
H, @HillaryClinton Vagina is Not a qualification. You are Corrupt! You are a Liar! I demand you OUT! Period. #Tatiana
how does a bill about healthcare cut finding for one of the most at risk groups in our society? #gNOp say no #GOP
#GOP ALLEGIANCE is to #KochBros & #NRA ONLY. FIRE These Asses #VOTE #BLUE in NOVEMBER w @HillaryClinton 
you have no clue what just came out of your Native American mouth! Insult to all healthcare providers
Keep your chin up Sen Warren. Many of us support your efforts!
Kinda like they cut money that would have paid for more US Embassy Security then attacks us(Dems) for it..?
As a Vet, I can assure you that not one cent of that would have benefited us. Raises and payoffs for senior mgmt put in by Dems.
increase taxes on rich and make Wall Street pay not only immediate restitution,  but fines. Use that then.
disgraceful!
As a veteran i have suspected the GOP actually resents VA benefits as just another burdensome entitlement.?
surely not the GOP that says how much they support the Vets... That GOP?? Of course!

I remember when Bush and Cheney cut VA funding after they caused a war. They even fooled with the disability.
the @HouseGOP don't givea damnabout our #vets this so-called #Zika is smokeandmirrors for #gop gov's to embezzle
That's ok, Trump will fix that.
what about #Ebola
@ZaibatsuNews @DeptVetAffairs repubs love active military, but vets don't give them any bang for their tax dollars...
@RonSupportsYou @DeptVetAffairs Once again defund the VA and blame everyone else! Pass clean bills GOP
may be they want to win an election!
OMG - Thank you for informing voters of this yet another underhanded move by the Pubs.
The GOP is busy breaking everything so they can privatize everything. The VA is top on the list. No Troop support
 For them. VA has a budget if over 150 billion. If you were so smart you'd find some fat to trim somehow
And Sen Blunt () of Mo brags as a Shepherd for the soldier..A major hypocritical Neanderthal
@SheWhoVotes  That's what Republicans do 
excellent work GOP support OUR veterans November America VOTING TRUMP PRESIDENT raising VETERANS hopes
@siracusa I don’t care what party you’re from, but the VA has nothing to do with zika. Stop it congress.
@ImaFreespeaker @DeptVetAffairs Sure..but even if true, $500 mil more for abject failure? They're killing more than they cure
why do you have our vets @PRyan @grouperpro why when all they do is give us freedom? @livenewscloud
you are a mini me of Hillary lying just a much projecting democrats faults onto the republicans
Maybe that is a right thing to do. Tax money is not unlimited.
GOP don't have the guts to make VA funds an issue. They have to hide it a higher profile bill. Gutless liars
Can we get rid of Republicans in Nov, please?
Too bad GOPhers didn't have a mindset to pay for stuff BEFORE they went into Iraq. Dems have to pay 1st , not GOP
@b_cogman @DeptVetAffairs But they blame Dems for not acting on Zika #Hypocrites
GOP funds War but does little for the Vets!!!
anti-vet
~ continue 2 empower & educate what's a stake whenever a bill is blocked & why not to believe the GOP propaganda!
good why give raises to doctors and nurses who have been killing vets.
@SenWarren @DeptVetAffairs
U want to help vets? Don't back a candidate who advocates war.  Then we wouldn't have to care for injured vets
The party of @realDonaldTrump
@Educ8tusAll @DeptVetAffairs I am a #USNavy veteran, and a VA Hospital employee. Who is looking out for us against the #GOP?
can I put a teepee up in your front yard and cook hot dogs
Unforgivable dereliction of duty. The care of our veterans, to whom we are indebted, is not optional.
.@SenWarren Sold her soul to Hillary @OccuCorporatism @DeptVetAffairs
GOP loves the military....until they're injured!  Repulsive.
u have lost your message, with progressive don't you get it! you can't be that tone deaf?
but they are the patriotic ones. Ugh!!!!
That is the reason, the SUPER SMART, DEMOCRATS, REJECTED THE BILL, GO FIGURE....DUHHHHHHH
@ what does vet get ?
@SenWarren @DeptVetAffairs
I thought trump and the GOP loved vets
And Republicans have the audacity to attack Obama for the VA's problems.
#KillaryClinton got blood on her hands.Leader of the pack who killed 4 Americans.She didn't even send help4 them.
SO much wrong with this.
Pocahontas
Are you kidding me? These people, yes these representatives of the people, all the people, are pond scum.
@GOP is hurting vets
get used to it when @realDonaldTrump is @POTUS expect the @DeptVetAffairs to close doors altogether
But the #GOP loves veterans! (Sarcasm) Thank you for pointing out that it is they who are defunding our Vets.
■■GOP WOULDN'T DO THAT ! ??)■■
AGAIN? $500 MILLION!!!
"But, we LOVE our VETS" !!
(We just DON'T PAY)
@picola1922 @SenWarren @DeptVetAffairs
Sounds like they're trying to trade one epidemic for several more.
Them sound like Indian givers.
