your a fraud!
@VanJones68 @SenSanders @CNN @AC360 There is no reason that a Montessori nutritionist would reach for a gun 4 a broken taillight!
really? She sure was ready with the camera? Prob didn't think  it would  go THAT bad
It doesn't pass mustard that a Montessori nutritionist with girlfriend&child would reach4agun
So what will Congress do to stop this unwarranted murder of black Americans?
Lets see pretend that it is not hate and that the murder is due to the guns. Because guns kill people
BTW people do kill people, with guns. Not knives, not cars, not swimming pools. Guns. Take them away, save lives.
You are not very bright people kill people w/knives cars, explosives, and drown..quick search
Man goes into elementary school in US with a gun. Kids dead. Man goes into elementary school in China with a knife. All live
just this week a man killed 19 in Japan with a knife... Are you serious?
Besides, if knives were actually a threat, why aren't we carrying knives? Why aren't we sleeping with knives? why only guns?
please keep talking to me. That's less time you'll spend polluting the minds of others.
@VanJones68 @AC360 @donlemon Just mention on CNN that no Montessori nutritionist with his girlfriend&child would reach for a gun!
- See how you are always race-baiting? It's an easy problem to solve.
@bigmouthpol
What about the 3400+ blk kids killed in Chicago alone since Obama took office. Why is it that D's never talk about those lives?
you know nothing of sandra bland. She hung herself. No one killed her. Her family wouldnt pick up the phone
@Fairshare2012 My message 2 #BlackLivesMatter movement, u can judge a person by the company they keep. #voteHillaryKaine
you are pandering to a racist  hate group and stirring up anarchy. Stop doing that bc it doesnt help.
Sandra Bland hung herself in her cell. Why are police to blame?
@SenWarren
what about the Caucasian guy? He doesn't count? #NativesCount #NativesAgainstWarre
How many of these people had a criminal record? Micheal Brown was shown on video robbing a store.
IF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THOSE NAMES YOU CAN'T PART OF THE SOLUTION ,YOUR PART OF THE PROBLEM !
Read the facts of all these cases and then put yourself in the officers place! "All lives matter"!!!
When you defy the law, thing such as this will happen #alllivesmatter when you obey the law
this is why you should hide your face. No support for the people that protect us is a shameful place for a sitting U.S. Senator!
and they were all crackpot thugs abusing the system and disrespectful of authority.
..You missed a few names..66 already this year to be exact. Dissapointing. #onesided
Name one that was unjustified or direct cause of police? Obey orders & respect authority!!!!!! #libtard
There are thousand killing each other in Chicago. Where is that list?
SAD that such an esteemed Senator stoops to stoke the fires of hate with her rhetoric!
And don't forget teenager Kalief Browder, who was profiled for being black, locked at Rikers & tortured. Killed himself in 2015.
your dad to day posts r so conflicting. Both sides of your mouth, dont quit ur day job. Honestly, best advice of the day..shhhhhj
Someone is still trying to defend thug Michael Brown after he attacked the cops?  And she is is Congress....that is messed up.
Alton Sterling was a career crimminal  Raped a girl,why wasn't he in prision?
Alton was a registered sex offender and a prohibited possessor in possession of a gun. Do you think that had any part?
You're fanning hatred of the police & ignoring the facts of those cases, specifically Michael Brown. You really should stop.
Felons
Off@the top of my head, I think Ofc Wilson was cleared in the shooting of the 18 year old man in Ferguson!
All of these guys were criminals! Stop your race baiting! Obama caused all of it, and Hillary will do even worse. PUT HER in JAIL
Last time I checked Michael Brown was attempting to kill a Police Officer?  Do u support that Ms. Warren?
Ur such a pandering #Liar MB was fighting with a police officer in his own patrol car lunged in the window tried2take Wilsons gun
shall we list the names of the officers murdered in cold blood? Of course not that doesn't fit your agenda. Pathetic.
Criminal lives don't matter.
looking for votes!!!
they are criminals its simple
i would love lunch and talk over coffee my good lady
Thank you Senator! You the best politician I have ever come to know during my lifetime of 50. Your the REAL DEAL!
Defending the actions of a few thugs make you "feel like somebody"? The facts negate your pandering for votes, and you are SICK.
you folks are the worst kind of racists..you expect less from all minorities
mike brown.....he went for a cops gun!!!!!!
michael brown? He strong-armed a store clerk and then went after a cop's gun what should the officer have done let him have it
- disgraceful! Videos r not cut and dry..Officers r due justice too, you should know this..think before u tweet.
do you know the names of any Blacks killed by Blacks in Chicago in the same time frame? Blacks I know fear young black men most.
fake indian @Kkane1978
actually #blacklivesmurder
it's nonsense comments like this that will put the blood of an innocent police officer on your hands!
Dear @SenWarren, these Black men were killed by a militarized police that are a product of the Clinton's system of mass incarceration.
how about supporting 99.9% of police that do their jobs without issue every single day? U and Hillary are peas in a pod #blue
a tweet like that just made up my mind that I'm voting #republican. Irresponsible race baiting.Not all those victims are innocent
Alton Strrling was an armed career criminal trying to access his firearm... How would you have handled that ma'am???
pandering at the lowest level. Why don't you get something done. All you do is talk.
you are one of the players causing the racial divide. You make all of us sick.
you have blood on your hands #BlueLivesMatter
Ofc Brent Thompson. Ofc Michael Krol. Ofc Patrick Zamarripa. Sgt. Michael Smith. Senior Cpl. Lorne Ahrens.  #BlueLivesMatter
yeah pretty sure brown was trying to get a cops gun...does the cop have to let him get hit before he does anything?@cdr419
are you kidding?  Stop victimizing the criminals.  These guys didn't get in trouble for being black, they got in it for being AHs
Who are the names of the 100+ Americans killed by illegal immigrants in 2015?!!!
why are you being racist?
Hey Fauxcahontas you have some proof Sandra Bland DIDN'T kill herself? If so contact authorities ASAP. No one else has it.
We done with your BS go back to your multimillions #sellout https://www.minds.com/archive/view/594961954343235594 …
You're a bad actor #Sellout https://www.minds.com/archive/view/594776912413335553 …

#All_Lives_Matter Bland: Suicide, others refused to stop assaults & trying  to kill officers Cops have to protect themselves.
@missb62 Anquon McDonald

Are you going to list the names of the police officers that died senselessly in the line of duty because of your race baiting?
omg she is CRAZY! She is so delusional, she doesn't realize SHE IS THE PROBLEM! Spreading lying #RhetoricKills #StopWithStupid
Senator Warren all lives matter.  Pushing a Soros terrorist organization is wrong. You madam are part of the problem #goofywarren
As much as I luv @SenWarren, sandra bland was a suicide and not all police shootings are unjustified. #alllivesmatter
Like anything you have to say means anything. You don't care anything about the black community except for their votes. #pander
Anyone w/your resources that doesn't reveal accurate information is lying.

In case you didn't know it, BLM groups are calling to kill white cops. Hopefully they're protecting you at the time.
Your statement is hate baiting and is very very sad Watch trump to see how to unify the country and state how you will fix issues
Sandra Bland hung herself. Michael Brown charged a police officer & tried to take his service revolver. Tamir Rice brandished gun
why let facts get in the way though?
seems to be everywhere nowadays. Take it easy. Aren't you 1/128 Apache? Take a puff on that peace pipe you inherited or stole.
really. I'm so embarrassed i live in MA. M Brown ATTACKED a police officer. what kind of elected official are you?
Not very BRIGHT are you STOP INCITING RACISM & BIGOTRY. Apparently U didn't LEARN much from COLLEGE WASTED STOLEN EDUCATION
Lyin' Liz u know many more whites r killed than blacks. Y incite a race war & assassination of police with fake stats? Soulless.
And, how many more? This is senseless! I'm sick of hearing "moment of silence"! We're supposed 2 b a great country! Do something!
Thank u Warren for being connected.
@shawnacismall lol @ Mike Brown. His hands were never up. He was a violent criminal who got what he deserved.  Let it go
So are you going to bother introducing some sort of legislation - or is a hashtag enough?
Is that all? BFD. How many blacks are shot by blacks in Chicago every day? #moron #blacklivesdontmattertoblacks
.@SenWarren Where are the names of the white people who've been shot? I'll wait .... @VanJones68

I wouldn't blame any police officer or secret service person if they refuse to guard you! I wouldn't take a bullet for you!
super predators - @HillaryClinton
To bad none of them obeyed police orders & shown respect they would all still be alive today. Place blame where it belongs. #PUKE
 you wouldn't know compassion if it bit you in the a$$, stop pandering to the #BLM they'd shoot you in a heartbeat #Pocahontas
I do believe those in BLUE protects your ass when you go out. and yet you just now spit on them.
you left off many names. That's the point.2 many 2 list.
Until racist cops are eliminated from law enforcement we'll continue this antagonism. Once they stop killing us the violence end
Elizabeth Warren, calling on BLM to Act!
way to contribute to ignorance & hysteria that fuels violence & racial tension. Keep making martyrs of criminals & vilifying cops

Sandra Bland killed herself. If you possess proof otherwise please tell. Until then u are part of the problem with the propaganda
@LeslieMarshall The cop with the gun is the face of the big government you want.  All law is backed by the gun.
@LeslieMarshall Please, don't tell America U went from Native American to Black,there's no benefits for U

@VanJones68 
2x as many whites, compared to blacks, are killed by cops--even though whites commit only 10% of violent crime.
I wish you and Hillary could run on the same ticket.
ugh
we all need to stand up and say ENOUGH. People who look the other way are guilty of this plague continuing decade after decade
All diobeyed police orders and were responsible for the results. OBEY POLICE ORDERS!
if u can enforce fed sanctions aga NC for not having transgender bathrooms you can do it for towns w #policeshootings. $$ talks!

Just a few of 100s @SenWarren
@tinkerbelledc PLEASE Sen. DO NOT let them blame these murders on "lack of training".. PLEASE PLEASE DONT LET THAT HAPPEN

What about Dylan Noble? Oh, wait, he doesn't fit the narrative
