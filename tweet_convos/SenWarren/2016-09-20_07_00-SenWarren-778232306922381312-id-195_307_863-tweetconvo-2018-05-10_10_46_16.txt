It is not just the banks, but many industries. I know  cause I went to them
.@SenWarren @SenateBanking  How do I add my complaint??
 @WellsFargo changed my account without my knowledge...
We're here to help. For a list of your accts, go online, call the number on your statement or visit a banking location. ^TL
In addition to corp fraud, he took more $ than any other banking CEO in US & should be prosecuted.
.@CampbellHarper how much $$ were coustomers wrongfully charged?  @SenWarren @SenateBanking @WellsFargo
No one knows yet-we do know 2M phony accounts, 5300 fired, $124M payday for unit exec
I was certain it was reported. Wells was already fined. @SenWarren @SenateBanking @WellsFargo
@ChrisNagusKMOV @Koster4Missouri , Guess you seen this? @SenWarren #WellsFargo
Ms.Bresch has NEVER witnessed a seizure(A.shock)that she's paid $19million yrly4, I suggest she does
PS. People, Paul Ryan & Mitch McConnell spend all their time trying to deregulate banks. Scum! @SenWarren @SenateBanking @SpeakerRyan @MSNBC
banks are over regulated. This was to help big bankers get rid of competition.  @SenWarren @SenateBanking @SpeakerRyan @MSNBC
Ok Crazy person, smell the coffee, or..drink the koolaid, whatever. @CaseyParksIt @SenWarren @SenateBanking @SpeakerRyan @MSNBC
been unemployed for over 10 yrs now, but God has been my stay.
Now is this one of the banks #Obama #Hillary bailed out?Yet you turn your back now?
Let him have both barrels. @SenateBanking @WellsFargo
god that was a thing of beauty
oh great the Senate is on it. Can't wait to watch again as nothing fucking gets done
You gave the usual left wing speech against free enterprise typical of a socialist.
Good job senator!
At the end of the day, "TALK" is cheap...
#UnitedStatesOfShame #WellsFargo 
@timervolina @SenateBanking @WellsFargo
@timervolina @SenateBanking @WellsFargo This is why NO ONE trusts our judicial system, separate rules for rich and poor. 
@timervolina @SenateBanking @WellsFargo If the average citizen committed such a crime, they would get a life sentence.
@timervolina @SenateBanking @WellsFargo Questions & prison are two different things... There's no excuse for Wall St. criminals.
senator Warren you're my hero #rolemodel 
<= @SenateBanking @WellsFargo Gutless leadership eh! You would know Pocahontas! #PJNET #TCOT #CCOT #TP4A
good for your tough questions but what's going to happen? Nothing as usual??
I have been living in the shadows of life for yrs. This is not the only company!
It is time legislators get these employers to treat employees fair.
I lost many jobs by this same type of antic/employers who make their own rules
My heart goes out to all those 5000 people who tried to play by the rules & lost jobs
People say get a job, but don't think about what is going on at the job. I know.
this is not the only company making life hard for employees.
Sen Warren, get em!
GREAT JOB ELIZABETH! VERY REFRESHING!!!
Easy for execs to'take full responsibility'then make a golden parachute exit. Not accountability!
OMG I love you.. You did a amazing job today
If Stumpf should resign, how about Jeh Johnson and @POTUS resign for this? http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/19/dhs-granted-citizenship-illegals-terrorist-nations/ â€¦ @jamestaranto
okay, Pocahontas... You're a fraud calling others on fraud?  You're as pathetic as Wells Fargo.  Fraud
Why? You're with Hillary, a known criminal. U let her crimes go. If Hillary can, so can Wells Fargo
And you call Trump a Bully!  Didn't even let the man speak..like a rabid dog who's lost it's brain.
Thank You once again!
The same thing happened at Time Waner Cable maybe worse . I can tell some stories....
.  to complain or cancel accounts employees had to try and sell something . "hate us, can I get you a credit card?"
-  the practice has been going on at Wells Fargo for over 15 years.   They had a rqmt that even if a cust call to ...
will you hold federal agencies to the same level how about IRS
Hypocrisy in all your action shows your existence is a failure
@ Wasting your time Hillary if elected will let Wells Fargo go Free & Clear
liz your not 4 real why is this a crime but crooked Hillary is a god sent . Really LOL clown
@ Yea How about holding Hillary Clinton Responsible   Just like Wells Fargo
good job! I worked at Wells Fargo till this past May. We need to keep these big banks in control.
Senator Warren, thank you for calling out John Stumpf!
U GO GIRL! Listening to u is as always inspirational.
You did a great job grilling John Stumpf today on Capital Hill!
You have to feel sorry for Wells if Warren is asking the questions. She's like a dog with a bone. Yuk
Great, another dog and pony show.
Congratulations great job !!!!  We need people like you in our in our Congress thank you
probably need to question the hill too for her fraudulent foundation
Make them pay dearly
Thank you, Senator Warren. We need more senators like you.
Yeah while you praise the POTUS who obviously has made no difference at all in fact made worse
If the Executives use loopholes in regulations is it surprising that Employee's do the same with their quotas?
loved wells Fargo comments-when there are 6000 "rogue" employees-the real problem is rogue management!
dismiss him & get 2next panel..he's Not allowed 2 b passive..not a massive fraud..he'll accept prison
I've watched this from beg today..unacceptable 4him 2pretend this ignorance..not gonna opine..
THANK YOU for being you. Oh how I wish you'd be our next president.  A total admirer of yours.
it's criminal what they've done. I'm one of the ones they stole from.
Its amazing that #Stumpf says he's fully accountable but blames low level employees. #FIRESTUMPF
You were fabulous - thank you a thousand times!
.@SenWarren should treat @WellsFargo like a Muslim who just slaughtered #LGBT, and start running interference for other bankers!
.@ProgsToday @SenWarren @WellsFargo She can't; she's a hypocrite.  It's one of the sacred mores of her tribe.
ms warren u want changes but u insist on playing with the same players in DC by supporting Hilary
great job senator. You are one of the few fighting for the little guy
Or how bout some tough questions re Hillary selling access to State Dept. You're a hypocrite!
I want to thank you Mrs. Warren for giving Mr. Stumpf what he deserves.
Hey Lizzy, how bout some tough questions re Hillary's outrageous fees for speeches to Goldman Sachs!
Great job Senator Warren. This practice started many years ago. First it was 2 accounts then 3 then 4.
big drilling but have to understand he isn't really in charge, look at who is biggest shareholder
Almost every govt program wrought w/ billions in fraud and Pocahontas call $2.5 million in false fees!! Grandstand much!!!
I find it very slanted that you  question Stumpf and cut him off at every reply he try's to make.
..Excellent questioning, Elizabeth Warren!  You put him in his place!
Thank you for doing your job on the Senate Banking Committee!  Thank you for exposing Stumpf!
Careful, those are @HillaryClinton friends you are messing with. Id hate for you to have 1 of those Clinton accidents
you should resign Elizabeth! You're a fraud and a liar! Your representation is disgusting!
nothing will happen to him. The hearing is a joke. He will keep his $200MM and never smell a jail.
Not a Democrat and do not agree with Sen. Warren on much, but re: hammering JStumpf..priceless
Justice Dept should certainly file criminal charges. NO WAY Wells Fargo CEO aren't jailed
isn't this rich, why don't any of you in government hold yourselves to the same standard? Fraud in every agency in gov. Nothing
Thank you Sen. Warren for go after that weasel.
incredibly effective! Best job ever.
Ask him if the rumors are true that Hillary campaign is charging poor seniors credit cards multiple x
how deep the fraud...the tellers should b rehired & their lives restored
only ones held accountable r those w/out $$ 4 best legal defense/woman overseeing=paid cause she knows
No one should miss this incredibly effective finding of the truth
his earnings should b clawed back&pay additional mortgage $$$ 2 all ppl affected
So you excuse the fraud perpetrated by the employees because their salaries weren't sufficient. Wow.
compliance my eye...
.@SenWarren .@SenateBanking @WellsFargo Government fines WF $185M & keeps all but $2.5M to throw wronged customers a bone NOW THAT'S CORRUPT
'i have confidence we've fixed this issue' = he couldn't possibly know thus because he knows Nothing
Senator, u make me proud. I wish others in Congress had the temerity to call these leach's out
1% of your company is fired 4 fraud & u know nothing about it(Vitter)
any chance you can ask him why they subsidize hillary camp. by reimbursing $$ Her campaign steals from small donors?
.@SenWarren .@SenateBanking @WellsFargo Lying Lizzie  SANCTIMONIOUS BULLSHIT $2.5M out of $185M for ppl whose lives & credit were ruined
executives' feet should be held accountable = J A I L them
I think your buddy Hillary would have issues with you trying to jail a banker. Just sayin. @caulkthewagon
Seeing your ferocity towards Wells CEO, and wonder why you support a candidate who owns the biggest laundromat in the world.
claw back his stock/multimillion $$ bonuses
Hallelujah...fact based evidence using his own words...2 prove his scams/cross selling...he's a felon
You are amazing!  I shudder to think what banks will do to customers w/o committed people like you to hold them accountable.
Thank you for your tough questioning of CEO John Stumpf, which was supported by fact. Punity needed!
thank you for making the case for prosecution, these people need to be held accountable
Thank you Senator for your intrepid questions today.
when will you question Obama on his 8 year scam to steal GSE's from shareholders? #fanniegate
Are you going to do anything about it?
Did they contribute to @HillaryClinton campaign?
if you're going to be a BULLDOG you'd better prosecute HILLARY CLINTON too
Brilliant interrogation of CEO, extremely well executed!
Massachusetts should be proud
Clinton Fam Foundation contributes to Clinton Foundation
Khan families r big contributors to Clinton Foundation
will you be resigning the Senate for lying about your heritage?
you just crushed @wellsfargo CEO John    Stumpf. Thank you Senator Warren
You've ruined your career supporting @HillaryClinton .
At most we see questioning & maybe a few & in fine but never punishment of their leaders.
@SenWarren @SenateBanking @WellsFargo @SalamMorcos
You were so Excellent! Thanks for looking out for those $12 hour workers #crossselling
Great work Elizabeth..Gutless leadership was to kind of a description!
WAY  to Go our Greatest Senator Warren.  You demonstrated how Capitol Hill should fight for us.
Planned Parenthood sells human baby parts
Are you asking questions or just making statements You support a crooked Hillary 
#HillaryClinton
great job.  You came prepared.
WF is forcing home loan applicants to open an acct b4 they'll fund the loan. So Calif
E. Warren showboating again.  Fire incompetent gov't employees - never!  What a self serving cancer!
you are a scam
Lizahontas you are a hypocrite
did you pay back anyone for lying about your heritage
I look forward to this woman becoming president in 2020.It'll be nice to have political representation
Oh dang. Now Stumpf and Drumpf would make quite a ticket, wouldn't it?
Most of these committees seem like showboating. Often, seems that nothing is done to fix the problem. @SenateBanking @WellsFargo
he is protected. No jail time here. Why don't you start protecting the non wealthy from these degenerate criminals
Ask them why they charge me $20 just to deposit CASH into my account.
Mr. Stumpf says he takes full responsibility for what happened. So he'll go to jail for fraud, right?
Thought we had agencies that oversaw this industry. Post 2008 you would have thought.......
Explain to them about your Native American scam while your there!
Please remind #JohnStumpf that the @WellsFargo enabling culture is of his design and  making. #ShowHimOut.
Even worse is the reward that exec got for resigning!! Sickening. #ShutDownWellsFargo
how about @HillaryClinton scams
seeing some bank dude plea the 5th over and over seems like a waste of time. Why even do this?
to make it look like she is doing something.   @SenWarren and  @SenateBanking are corrupt. Looking for pay offs. @WellsFargo
go easy on him, he is a @HillaryClinton supporter. For real change vote @realDonaldTrump
Students should be required to vote to get their free college !
What, employees making fake accounts to meet quotas?
Let me know when he's in jail.
Desperate ppl cheat to keep jobs; execs still get bonuses?
If "lock him up" was ever appropriate.
A dog and pony show.  No one will go to jail.  The politicians are owned by Wall St.
yup. They fined the bank which only hurts customers,  @SenWarren and  @SenateBanking are corrupt. @WellsFargo
Hey @Millennials4Her w/ @HillaryClinton & Dem Sen wins, @SenWarren will have more leverage to take on scammers
Jail him pour encourager les autres. C-level execs need to feel personal pain, or they'll do it again
demoncrat big donor watch they will be to big to jail just like Hillary political protection 4 friends
.@SenWarren @SenateBanking @WellsFargo Sleeping at wheel again @elizabethforma ? How many thousand people over how many yrs before u notice?
more bankers committing felonies and walking away! Super. Meanwhile a joint gets you a record. #farse
Bankers need some serious JAIL-TIME! Time to ACT! Congress/Senate how long must we suffer? @SenWarren @SenateBanking @WellsFargo @MSNBC
US gov is so corruot, they fine the banks instead of prosecuting the law.  @SenWarren  is corrupt. @SenateBanking
Nail him to the wall.
Good. BUT...will ANYthing REAL be done about it? Will the criminals face punishment for their CRIMES?

President Trump to disband the Senate just to get to you.
Just like Emperor Palpatine did in Star Wars?
