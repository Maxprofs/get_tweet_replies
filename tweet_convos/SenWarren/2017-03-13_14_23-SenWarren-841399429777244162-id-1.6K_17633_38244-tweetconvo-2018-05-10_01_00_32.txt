dude.... just get a better job with better benefits.
that's easier said then done for many ppl
I agree. but Repubs love to tell ppl with a min wage job to get a better job! What's the dif?
Min-wage job wasn't created 2 support the 3-4-5 person fam, created to earn$ 2get btr job
,@SenWarren 'we' control nothing, at least until 2018. Are you waiting for conscientious repubs to step-up? That's not their vibe.
will lose even more seats in 2018
,@newyear420 @SenWarren maybe in methed up flyover country, but nowhere where people actually *wanna* live.
lol. never been able to think for yourself. keep dual citizenship on the coasts. I'm good with watching you fly on over.
,@newyear420 I'm not good with you ruining our country, but it'll affect you and yours more than us 'coastal elites.' Which is truly sad.
not ruining, just getting it back to normal, didn't vote for Trump. do you some good to get educated on the flyovers you loathe
,@newyear420 um, what era do you consider 'normal' in US history? Serious question.
I have no problem going back to right before I was forced to buy anything in my life. Seriously I'm not even forced to buy water
#trumpcare is only for the rich @realDonaldTrump - FOR SHAME
#trumpDOESNOTcare This is a new low point for the country.
the low point was actually electing him president....the bad thing is that we haven't hit rock bottom yet
*you're and no I did not vote for trump therefore I did not elect a racist crook, liar maybe u shld read b4 speaking
lol I"M a racist Nazi and fascist??  I DIDN'T vote for trump? What alternate reality do u live in??
KICK HIM OUT!
good luck lmao
and you have ten followers bot
sore loser
Lady,2 give people an insurance card that no Doctor will take is even worse!Especially when those people pay 4 them!Ur Dems R racking it in!
not sure there are 24 million on the ACA.
#trumpcare will mean death to many. I guess this is GOP population control #GOPnazis
Where are their "Christian values" now?
Where are their so-called "Christian values" ever?
oh shut up!!  You and all the other senators don't even use the same insurance that you push on the people
Not if they don't want it. We HAVE to #RepealAndReplace #Obamacare the best way we know how.
I worry that my son will lose his healthcare. Can we please call it #trumpdoesntcare instead of #trumpcare ? It seems accurate.
More like #ObamaDoesntCare instead of #Obamacare. That is exactly what I thought of Obamacare.
Why do you assume all 24 million are getting "thrown off"? How about the millions that willingly won't buy what they don't want?
the middle class is tired of supporting the worthless class
@KevinDarryl um butt isn't that's what the zombie trumpturds wanted
#SinglePayer
Universal health care. Try it America, you'll love it. Love your friends from #Canada
big issue with universal health care is cost control, who control the cost & innovation w/o competition
Healthcare isn't something you leave to the free market. Why not give $ incentives R&D for cures?
Then Medicaid for All would pay X amount for contract on cure (not just symptom reliver) for X many yrs.
Thank you - even AARP is asking everyone to contact congress - no on Trumpcare.
you guys had your chance and all you did was fuck the working class
#trumpcare is simply a large death panel. Dooming poor, sick, elderly while giving rich a fat tax break. Read CBO report, folks.
Obamacare makes working people BUY overpriced junk insurance for our families to provide good insurance for other families.
call it #Republicare. Don't let them inevitably just blame it on Trump alone.
been calling it #GOPcare. I think the entire party should get credit.
another good alternative.
.@SenWarren Let's cut straight to the chase-> #Medicare4All #FeelTheBern #Healthcare #Health #StPaul #Baltimore #NYC #LA #SF #Chicago #ATL
are you just going to vote no like always or are you going to suggest changes or offer something else
It's time for everybody in Washington to get together and try to come up with a plan that will work for the people
more like #trumpcareLESS
please don't stop fighting. I will be a drain on the state if I'm so poor I can't pay my bills.
it's #donTcare
it's about time everybody pay something. Nothing should be for free. Even if it is only $20 a month, everybody should pay.
