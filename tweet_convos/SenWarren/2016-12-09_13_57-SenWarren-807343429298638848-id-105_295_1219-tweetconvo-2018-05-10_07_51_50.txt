nothing about the hacking
fight 4 the people we remember!!
PLEASE HELP KEEP TRUMP OUT OF THE WH!!!
to late
he was elected, to try to stop it is a threat to democracy.
It's a threat to our democracy to sit back and let Russia try to sway election!!
never happened, that's just a Clinton deflection. Her crimes were revealed.
democrats dont give a flying phuk about coal miners. obamas policies are putting them out of jobs.
That doesn't mean Dems don't care about people. Democrats also care about the planet. @CrowbarCat @SenWarren @Sen_JoeManchin @SenCapito
peak oil used to be settled science.
The scientists settled on climate change depend on grants to stay afloat.
Typical Fox News analysis. 97% of the scientists believe climate change is real and man-made. Pretty big conspiracy, huh? @CrowbarCat
Typical lefty response. You could look into the Holocene optimum,
the Roman Warm Period,
The LIA
MWP. Also, proxy data is crap.
from a right wing nut who first believe in science 97% of the scientists disagree with you, I'll go with the smart ppl.
go with deception then http://www.nationalreview.com/article/425232/climate-change-no-its-not-97-percent-consensus-ian-tuttle …
the deception is on the right denying the science.
senator Warren why help Joe when he didn't help us !!
didn't you put them out of business
go get em!
Hope you got their promise to stand by you when it comes to the medicaid and social security votes!
@Republiicunts @Sen_JoeManchin @SenCapito What about the repugs that covered up Russian-Gate like Mitch Pig McConnell?
One of your rare good moments!
@sandee0802 @Sen_JoeManchin @SenCapito You mean the very coal miners HRC vowed to put out of work?
Bahahahaha! You mean the miners that you and Hillary were happy to see lose their jobs?! Liar! Liar!
If DT doesn't believe in climate change, Why is Ivana's platform global warming?

oh, and now you're for them?
AHEM, Russia hacks?? @Sen_JoeManchin @SenCapito
not much on reading comprehension here! For: coal miners earned pensions and ret. benefits Not forcoal
Why?  Seriously, why pick this fight?  For people who vote for the R's screwing them?
Retired miners who consistently vote against their own interests.  Zero sympathy.
did you mention closures in Pennsylvania West Virginia and Ohio. Obama and EPA shut them down
"go for it!" 
You should run, president 2020
you dork warren
help them by getting them better jobs in renewable energy. #climatechange #savescience
You have class beyond measure.  Merry Christmas!
coal is done move on to modern energy clean sources.
1) Coal miners need to hear hard truth not sugary lies: coal jobs imperiled by cheap gas, not EPA. And
..HRC on right track, BUT miners need job opps realistic for them-not vague promises of "retraining".
Been doing any tee-pee crawling lately?
@HuddlestonR @Sen_JoeManchin @SenCapito the irony is Dems are trying to protect their rights and they voted for Trump !
How nice, now you want to fight for somebody instead of fighting with everybody. We will be watching!
handing out lolly pops at the bank.
He's been PUNKED DRUMPF played his supporters like a $3 $$ bill.
Keep fighting the good fight, even if many of those you're fighting for have no idea.
You're sending mixed messages here.
@twchristi @Sen_JoeManchin @SenCapito Where's the fight for green energy? Cause you lowered your expectations doesn't mean we did
would be interesting to see the profits pulled out of these mines in the last 70 y
Wow that surprised me you support the coal industry. Thanks
You're a joke. #democrats have destroyed the coal industry. #givingdopesavoice #lyingliz
...THE COAL COMPANIES FILED BANKRUPTCIES 2 STEAL #CoalMinersFamilies EARNED PENSIONS & BENEFITS! EVIL!
Seems like Mr. Trump gave up on the coal miners right after he was elected.
#CoalMiningFamilies R AMERICAN FAMILIES WHO HAVE WORKED 4 U.S. THEY DESEVE THEIR PENSIONS & HCare & SS
Thank you
like fighting for horse carriage drivers by banning cars. Retrain miners for 21st C jobs, don't pander

I just have a really hard time caring about people that have shown they only care about what they get.
Why don't you go 2 #StandingRock?Why don't you go to #Flint where ppl R forgotten.
OMG, I usually don't agree with you ma'am, but sometimes...SOMETIMES...I see your humanity...ty
Give them hell Senators
:didn't your buddy Obama want to put them out of business? Wish your voters would put you out of business!
Bring Hillary with you to remind the people of WV how much you care about the miners...
People have Died. Some of us Survived. I put 2 & 2 together. Obama wouldn't help me. Neither will you.
reps proved there are no consequences to shutdowns!
hollow threats are bad precedent and a loosing strategy.  If you're gonna bluff go all in!
The MOGB destroyed paperwork showing oil spills. I was told by a worker not allowed to keep them.
we also need clean energy please don't hesitate to use your position to help with that
Oil Fields & Wells so close to homes started 40's thru 1980.Caused so many Cancers in 1 county.US owes

Coal miners and Buy American. Republicans just jammed that theme down @SenateDems throats, turn tables
Then you know exactly where you need to start. Here, let me assist you:

...senators - but hold it you might check your platform on the coal issue.
Anything for a photo ok. No shame...
wtf
@realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP @SenateGOP Look who is fighting for the coal miners now Donald-Not the GOP
this is the reason American minorities don't need these phonies, it's WWC and we don't count.
Americans will need to term limit the senate and congress want these co enablers out of our offices
Just give them Ocare. Like rest of us.Why treat some more special than others? Why we distrust govt
remember ur gun violence quote about 8 kids?  It DOES happen every day w/cancer kids. Support #STARAct
@Sen_JoeManchi How do you plan on supporting coal when we need to move to renewable resources? #climatechange  = #sacrifice
Why? Dems r usually not standing for anything . This bill didn't hv to pass.
Ma has nothing to do with coal mining. Can you close pilgrim nuclear power plant. It's old&dangerous
did u think no one was going to notice this hypocrisy, u have a un-embarrassability @realDonaldTrump
Standing with each other & uniting together is how we can make change
Good grief ...
Now your in favor of.coal
They supported Trump & Republican candidates.They'll blame Dems & blacks for lossed benefits not Trump
Elizabeth: Speak with courage. You're our animating spirit. Pres Truman would say: "give 'em hell!"
Give 'em Hell EW! C'mon Senators do the right thing. Coal Miners / Health Insurance -- No Brainer!
the coal miners yr bff Hillary tried  terminating their jobs LMFAO @realDonaldTrump @KELLYANNEPOLLS
how bout y'all support them by creating jobs that don't kill them and the environment. Crazy, right?
Why? Coal miners wanted Trump to help them ... Let them see the results since facts don't matter. Maybe real life will show them
can you run for president, please?
I hope they appreciate your loyalty since most voted for Trump! #irony
For the sake of the planet we must leave fossil fuels in the ground. @charlesmarks22 @SenWarren @Sen_JoeManchin @SenCapito
How do you square support for coal miners with global warming?
#notmypresident #resist #UniteBlue
You suddenly support coal miners???
most coal miners voted trump but it is the dem party that will protect their healthcare
You're a joke. A big MESS.
Go get them, Senator Warren!
