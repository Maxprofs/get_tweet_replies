Why don't you support charter schools? Oh. I know Teachers Union. Shame on you.
Charter schools have not proven effective or efficient. Do some research.
Do some research!

Racist to want the worst union teachers in poor city schools when charters perform well there:
Nobody is making you live here so do the country a favor & move to Canada. Taxpayers will buy your train ticket.

PETITION ELECTORS!
worried about profit colleges. Radical profs pose National Security threat. Maybe @realDonaldTrump can fix it through Fed $ rules
You mean shady State Universities...?
- agreed.  Should also check diversity claims of cheating profs who get paid so much college costs go thru roof
is too shady to even qualify as Title IV. We can expect wholesale open fraud everywhere now
Please keep fighting. Hopefully all Dems will join in and speak up with clarity and strength. Repubs should, too! Thank you.
So tell US.@SenWarren  isn't it ILLEGAL to sell something as a UNIVERSITY, when it is NOT?  What are the requirements to be a University?
Uner the current administration students are being ripped off.  Public schools ripping us off too.
@xxopxe  Like a pack mule with blinders you wallow in minor issues (tuition), never making substantial points.
Oh I give up. Just his being nominated by the GOP shows that we're a country of a22ho!es. Great work, America.
killer Clinton being nominated shows US nation of imperialists!no more #HillarysWars
You allowed students to be ripped off for eight years with the government loan student Ponzi scheme! You lie!

I take it from your grammar that you are a Trump U. professor

YOU @SenWarren claim to be for the middle class, however you take money & direction from SOROS?! @realDonaldTrump @GOP @KellyannePolls #MAGA

#jesus #Pocahontas why don't you? for profit student loan defaults=44% of all SL defaults and you own their shares #thatsfuckedup

Elizabeth Warren, is a very sore loser! Good riddance pocahontas!
they became political indoctrination centers for the left

- What have you been doing about it since you've been in Congress; why is it @realDonaldTrump's problem?

GREAT thing about DJT, he's going to bring back much needed tech schools. Lazy kids sit in "art" degree sch

We should be more worried about a Woman who would lie about being a Native America to further her career #Liar
@angie7575 @realDonaldTrump maybe he'll open a new university on running for president
Or a new book "F U. How I mastered the art of  #Bullshit" by Donald J Trump
maybe the last chapter will have hints on how to avoid bar hotel trumps way
- We should be worried that in the 21st century, there are idiots that believe the crap you tell them.
At least Trump doesn't talk like a preschooler like you. Seriously, a four-year-old would make a better senator than you. #Trump
You supported Hillary which tells me your outrage of big TBTF is phony. U will be an obstructionist to Trump.
Anything like your free education while claiming native american status? You have no room to talk
I'm worried that you are a George Soros puppet.
I don't think we are being tough enough on this low life that is now going to be our president.

what was all that talk about working with Trump? Trying to keep your cooky base happy?
Maybe you should look inside DEM party before lashing out?! HYPOCRISY x3 = https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-bill-clintons-nearly-18-million-job-as-honorary-chancellor-of-a-for-profit-college/2016/09/05/8496db42-655b-11e6-be4e-23fc4d4d12b4_story.html …

 U R SO RIGHT!!
Who's being ripped off? I'd say the parents of this student: http://video.foxnews.com/v/5219854806001/?#sp=show-clips …
where were you or any other politicians before this? How convenient to worry now.
Stop fear mongering Chief Breaks Wind. President @realDonaldTrump is going to be the best President this county's ever had. BTFO!

Sign the petition to end Superdelegates
Tulsi Gabbard launches petition to end Democratic Party superdelegate process http://fb.me/XTRpGH3H 
Maybe they will stand up to people like you who falsely claim to be Aboriginal in order to receive grants.
Yes - we should be ripped off by Harvard charging $250,000 tuition and paying fake natives $475,000 to teach.
@RafifJ @realDonaldTrump I owe $270k for my education!!
I don't regret it, but geez,
that's over a 1/4 million dollars!

- soo tired of listening the DNC rabble rousers whine about Trump. God bless you, but S.T.F.U
you have no idea how much I and many of my friends are looking to you for your leadership against this mad man! HELP We support u
If those shady for-profits didn't have to pay "professors" $250,000 to "teach" a class, maybe tuition comes down
we are worried. But what are we supposed to do about it? We voted. We lost. It's in your hands now.
it's not her or Hillary being the 7 headed beast, it's old guy that has the ass to house a lot of 7 headed beasts #indictsoros
Liz, we all know that the Dept of Education is unConstitutional so put up a bill to remove it.  Ok?
And you Lied saying you are Native American. Loony Liz.
we should be worried about your meeting with George Soros.
we should also be worried when native american senators ignore native american needs. #nodapl #silenceisconsent we are watching.
hey @SenWarren where are you while native americans are being attacked in North Dakota? are you not native american anymore?
We should disband the #TeachersUnions that worry more about their pay & benefits than our children.
@wilytone @realDonaldTrump crossed the line from
shady for-profit college to
shady-for-profit college. If I may.
what are you doing about the insurance/annuity rip offs in 403b accts? @nytimes article has details. Where r u on this issue?
We should all be worried if the Trump administration doesn't END the Dept. of "Education" . . .
...fight on, Elizabeth the LionHearted!
stop throwing dirt and get a life.
Lets talk about getting ripped off. You ripped off the American taxpayers w/your education claiming you were an American Indian..

we should be worried about the overall education our kids are getting! Not one knows our countries constitution
Whose spot did you steal Fauxcahontas?

You libs are for keeping these horrible state run schools. You guys keep black people down with the schooling you give them.
