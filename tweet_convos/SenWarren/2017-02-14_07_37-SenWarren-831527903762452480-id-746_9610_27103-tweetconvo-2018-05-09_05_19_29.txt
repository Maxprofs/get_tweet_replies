No one cares. Get a real party platform. You'll never win attacking Trump.
you don't care. Trump supporters don't care. Others do care.
It's not that they don't care. They know it would be impeachment material.
The president is not subject to conflict of interest laws, You know that, right?
I'm talking Russia ties...
just left wing desperation. There is nothing there. It's like 1950 Joseph McCarthy.
What specifically are you alleging? Do you even know? What do you think Trump did illegal
get a senate investigation he needs to be vetted
needs to be voted out.
I say it's an easy bet @realDonaldTrump is in Putin's pocket.
I find this difficult to believe. Provide link? I'd love it to be true but...
But not a link?
Well, if you saw this why didn't you RT?Or have you only been told it was there?
Doing my best!
@alallbutt @realDonaldTrump I'm at a loss why the fat orange one hasn't been impeached.
there's time yet. Not a month in yet
Will he make the famous first 100 days?
I just hope he will have the embarrassment of being removed from office for ineptitude
Ineptitude is one of many faults. Traitor?
why is the GOP protecting him? Are they selling us out to Russia?
I'm marching April 15th. If he's still in power...hopefully not.
good for him! I hope he doesn't release them just to irritate you. Seriously.
Pocohontis is smoking the peace pipe WAY TOO much,, find Running bear and close the tent flap for a week or 2 !!
no one really cares you don't get it keep working harder in the illegals and refugees than true americans
like you said you dont know dont run your pie hole on info you dont have! Just proof democrats like you lie!
if nobody knows Lizzy y r u sayin he does? U r #VeryFakeNews try harder right now @DrJillStein beatin ya badly
I believe a full accounting is in order. With nothing to hide, why not? The American people deserve transparency
Start the impeachment process before the invasion of Ukraine!
Then do something about it please & stop grandstanding. Preaching to your choir isn't changing anything. Thank you.
Republicans blocked this. We need better coalition from Democrats and bipartisan ethics
Guess what , WHO CARES!
@PMorris153 @realDonaldTrump if a black president must show his birth certificate, a white billionaire must show his tax returns
Why don't we focus on how you have millions in net worth on a Senate salary? Where is all that coming from?
cause he's hiding a lot of shit
If he can get emails and get Russia to hack into our systems, surely it should not be difficult to get tax info.
goofy e. Warren. Just stop talking already. You look like a fool.
where are his taxes?
sure seems like there's a way to force that one! We need to see his taxes
@Barbie892 MAKING PERSONAL BUSINESS DEALS ENRICHING THEMSELVES MORE TRAITORS THIEVES LIARS CORRUPT CRIMINALS IMPEACH ALL
and Hillary still won't release her emails uhmmm
why isn't anyone on the hill submitting to have them seen?
Absolutely!  not to mention US paying for children as counselors and their world trips for business / vacations?
lieawatha do you have proof he is making money overseas if so lets see it! Show proof  show proof you cant
So if nobody knows because he won't release his tax returns than how is he "still making money overseas"..LMAO
@Barbie892 @realDonaldTrump WAKE UP! U DONT NEED TAXES NEED HIM TO PAY OVER BILLON HE OWES. EXPLOITING PRESIDENCY
Until he releases his tax returns he should be considered a traitor.
@Luv_trumps_hate @realDonaldTrump Perhaps congress can   hold votes hostage until he does.
Didn't seem to bother you that Hillary was accepting Foreign countries donations after she said she would not
We know he will continue to make money, that breaks no rules or laws as he is not in control of his business
and GOP votes to make sure that continues.
Tell us about your Suze Orman debit card fraud connections! You won't get away with it! FRAUD
trumpies are so lame. You have to idea what you're talking about.
@HeyThatsMyPen @realDonaldTrump you know what Elizabeth, we know, now do something about it. We elected you, help us!
@Magdalena0113 @realDonaldTrump Ms. Warren SAVE US

keep the faith. we love you. we need you. you are one of our strongest voices, please stay with us.
@BernieSanders keep 'em honest.  Watch how the cookie crumbles around the Liar-In-Chief & his Team Of Liars !
@TGowdySC  don't you have better things to do like, ummm pass bills that will really help our country?
and you make money teaching 1 class because u lied and said u were a Fckn indian, also flipped houses 4 profit
1924 law gives congressional committees that set tax policy the power to examine tax returns.
this is prime reason why @POTUS must be forced by #congress to #release all #tax #returns. #CongressActNow
U know that 4 a fact?
Such indignation.
@WideReceiverMen  Follow @Khanoisseur  there is all kinds of leads there.
@xdelmar59 Maybe everyone needs to point out that the Republicans in the Ways & Means Committee voted against getting Trump taxes
wait until you have to release yours and then Americans will see how rich you are for being a fake Native American
Give it up. We have a Republican House and Senate. This might takes years. Bengazzi did.
Exactly. What are you hiding @potus??
Electoral Majority has SPOKEN. We see by the post reaction (that borders on Manic) that right decision was made
He has stepped away from his company. Grow up. Your lunacy is showing.
Nowhere does the US Constitution say the POTUS can't own assets overseas. Show me the law.
oh hell yes, he is!
@AlasscanIsBack U guys have the power appoint a prosecutor and subpoena them
you are a senator! If you can't find a way then who can. Dirt is to be found but you need a shovel first!
MAKE IT HAPPEN!!! Make it required by ALL future Presidents.
it shows he's a phony!
@EllenPompeo release your taxes
The House Ways & Means committee could have gotten his tax returns but failed the people.
?s of mental fitness, financial entanglements, knowledge of the law & foreign interests should be resolved B4 someone can run!
can you guys work with the house to get some bills on the floor that will prevent this kind of nonsense in future elections?
I thought Wikileaks was working on this. Is it possible they are also lying liars?
we need to see his taxes and our elected officials should be doing their jobs!!
the left doesn't stop just shows how immature you really are. How sad grow up
@mikeofmuth @realDonaldTrump you need attys looking up ousting procedure for unwilling and derelict GOP members or file suits
get over it already you crazy ole coo! The American ppl dont care about his tax return.#snowflake 
Because your Republican colleagues will not allow it. Why? What are THEY hiding? Push House for impeachment!
if nobody knows, why are you spreading disinformation? Propaganda? Stop being a sore loser .
also there is NO LAW that enforces the president to share his taxes... I wouldn't either! Don't have to
@HenryBLowery @realDonaldTrump Honest question. Why can't Congress demand Tr**p's tax returns? #IllegitimatePresident
@vjf6122 @SenWarren @HenryBLowery @realDonaldTrump its not profitable to them
Is 45 charging the govt for him and his guests to stay at his resort?  Please investigate if he is profiting
If nobody knows, then your tweet is a lie.  Liar.
Goddamn - then DO something about it! DEMs these days r like headless chicken.
Where the heck are the grown-ups?
Stop Congress from legislating until this traitor is out of office!! Oil industry is on a tear!!
and business conflicts of interest...all important.
As long as he's making money, nothing else matters! Not my president. Crooked!! Lock him up!
Investigate!
#Dig
#Impeach

..
And I read where Senate Republicans could have made him release to committee, but wouldn't. WHY???
when are you going to tackle the real problems in this country get over it Trump is president #MAGA
Beth, you have nothing of value to contribute to our country. Please resign.
Ties like facilitating US Uranium to Russia?  Darn where is that reset button when you need it. #Liz4Pres #MAGA8
so beating a dead horse get over it you lost #hillaryslapdog
you wouldn't understand his complicated return. And you would explain it incorrectly #shutupLiz
@MarkRuffalo @realDonaldTrump Go get him, Sen. Warren! We are 100% behind you!
Get a grip pocohontas, you had your 15 minutes of fame now go away, go shake elsewhere.
And you still wont release a sane thought!
follow the money to corruption. Vlad's been yanking his "string" for a WHILE.
what are going to do about allowing the mentally ill yo own guns?
@EllenPompeo @realDonaldTrump great laugh at 3am! Support the country,stand behind your President. Stop feeding hatred and crime.
how can you say "nobody knows" yet still make such an accusation?
@funder @realDonaldTrump if he has on going business transaction how would we know???
its obvious he is hiding his financials .   He is a traitor.
apparently KellyAnne the con says no one cares about 45's taxes.   Lies!
we will never know the extent because he was allowed to take office without revealing his taxes.
@SpeakerRyan I want DJT taxes. 3 team Trump members departed due to Russian ties. DJT ties need investigation
@funder @realDonaldTrump 45 getting rich off of US citizens. Why do WE bear the brunt of Mar a Lago trips. The corruption boggles
@funder @realDonaldTrump can't we get them from IRS?
@TheKevinAllison @realDonaldTrump Here are the names/numbers of the 23 @WaysandMeansGOP members who voted NO on releasing them.
@HillaryClinton please strong women. We need an election do over!!! Make this happen! Rid the WH of these dangerous people
and ways and means committee deny asking trump for tax returns!
.@SenWarren @belalunaetsy @realDonaldTrump But you're tied to pizzagate Liz eeeeeeew!

W00T!
No one should even be able to run if they don't turn in taxes.  Working for the people, not self.
@taxmarch LET'S DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
Let's hope they're subpoenaed during an independent investigation.
help me understand dear lady. is it your mission to impeach Trump or is it your mission that republicans fail
... how do we make this mistake go away?
If NOBODY knows then how do YOU know? Again, bad karma coming your way.
It's time to stop asking politely. Time to demand that he #Resign. Or else. #ImpeachTrump. @SenWarren @mercedesfduran @realDonaldTrump
Lets see what trump is hiding....SHOW ME THE TAXES!
Republicans need to grow a pair and act before its truly to late
@cnn Kevin Brady (GOP) won't request Trump's tax returns. Here's his number if you want to call (202) 225-4901.
IF he declared it on his taxes
love you so much Sen. Warren. Your will to fight for us means the world.
@MansurGidfar @realDonaldTrump AND the GOP just voted not to demand he show them.
I got an idea. Allow Milo, Shapiro, Carlson, McKinnis, and Lauren Southern speak at Berkeley than he releases
what about using his own club to entertain Abe?  He couldn't make a local golf course the location? No $ in it
That's what I keep saying. If Trump didn't have something 2 hide, he would release his tax returns.
- And @RepKevinBrady won't do his job and compel a review of POTUS tax returns. Playing partisan politics over country.
you are a freakin nut case
NO LONGER his call. IT IS a matter of national security!
Trump is a Russian Spy, just like Evelyn Salt.
speculation based on subjective opinion, apparently not familar w 1040s, when does witch hunts begin?
Are we doing enough to stop this dangerous situation?How is it possible that we had no power to stop this!We want to sleep again!
Warren, you are a joke, a hater, a divider. Put your country first.
Sen. Warren-I hope you read the document showing how DT has been compromised by Russia.
What ASHAME!!! ABSOLUTELY ASHAME.
are you still a native American...Are or you making that up?  You have no credibility Warren
You are an inspiration; thank you for being such a strong voice for so many Americans.
@JesseLaGreca Which is WHY WE AMERICAN PEOPLE ask other nations NOT TO SUPPORT Trump Brands! The name stands for hate & disgust!
@rugratfarm and the GOP won't let us go after them? What's next option to try?
I would say a million people class action, asking a NEUTRAL judge to demand his tax returns-We suspect tresson
@sesharps 
"Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets ... money pouring in . . ."  DT Jr
I do beleive Congress can request his taxes.  And then hve them entered into the Congressional Record.
what are the chances Russia 1099'd him?
.@SenWarren WHY did Repubs on the Ways & Means Committee vote down getting a copy of Trump's taxes to review? They did that TODAY.
@1CrazyBeach @realDonaldTrump
are his companies billing the country of the leader that he entertains at Mar A Lago?
I was wondering why he hasn't released them. It is all starting to make sense now.
dt unacceptable!
wasn't there a vote today for his tax returns but it was voted NO?
#stopHIM
when/how does someone "with standing" raise the question in the courts? In Congress?
and Congress let it slide.....
@DrJamesPeterson @realDonaldTrump @GOP @SenateDems   If he's not guilty, what is there to hide. Americans deserve/demand answers.
will you be using the 1924 law that the senator from NJ found to release his taxes?
@1_mo_please @realDonaldTrump an you are still acting like you are an American Indian with ties to tax free money.
@chrislhayes @realDonaldTrump AND the republicans just voted down to have them released.
Agreed, @SenWarren - but why would anyone think his tax returns are in any way truthful?
.@realDonaldTrump is still making money overseas & may have financial ties to Russia. Nobody knows since he STILL won’t release his taxes.
since when is delivering sketchy and unproved allegations in public ok for senators? #shameful
but you were happy to push Hillary who absolutely does have proven financial ties to Russia? lol such a hypocrite Liz
Will Congress force release of taxes?We need to see them MoreThanEver.Not 4 curiosity;4 nat'l security
are you still worried about his taxes? Do me a favor, put yours on here so we can all see them
