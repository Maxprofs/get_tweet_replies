This was something he knew before he ran. This is not a surprise requirement. It's in the Constitution.
It is NOT in the constitution.Washington, and many others had big businesses and wealth
Trump s/b Req'd 2 comply 100% w/ethics off. or NO inaug. GOP lettng tump think he can do/not do whatever
Only a totally classless lib would post something like this. TRUE colors,disgusting
You're a TOTAL LIGHTWEIGHT!
and eealDonaldTrump is an impersonator of a predator, a slug, a moron.
Can't u get few GOP on board? The spin that criticism of Trump is "partisan" is effective smear campaign.
so what brought about the profit that Obummer walks with? You protest too much - heard of that before?
Trump should have thought about this before running. This or that. Choose one only.
And Trump and co can walk out if they don't like the terms.
why would he walk out? It's not one or the other...he can do one, the other, both, neither

"from a king, prince or foreign state. "
So as long as he's not doing business with kings and countries, he's good
I'm not a trump supporter, but if this were Clinton...would the spin be different? I think maybe
So Dems have a problem with @realDonaldTrump and business but never talked about @HillaryClinton /CGI?
because you never talk bad about the home team.
Russia is conflict
Someone needs to petition SCOTUS to overturn the election
have you not understood why the Dems lost over 1000 seats across states, House, & Senate. Learn!
If you have more debt than wealth you can't divest
This moron better understand Trump doesn't have a lot of debt. So sick of lib MORONS

he wants his cake and to eat it too
@rm1268 @OfficeGovEthics @POTUS @YouTube WHY ARE U ALLOWING HIM TO STEAL PRESIDENCY SHE WON.  PROTEST
. I agree, but trump will keep doing whatever he wants.
No one cares what you think as a hyper-partisan. You have lost credibility. The People respect efforts of @realDonaldTrump
You don't want to play by the rules of the game, don't play the game. Can't rewrite rules as you go along
tell that to the Dems who can't seem to grasp we have the Elect College. They lost! DEAL
Geez! Get over it! You lost the election because the people are tired of the libtards giving away America
How long before Shaub is fired? Evn w/Divestiture, Trump is NOT President.
The problem is Liz Warren DOESN"T think she just runs on the fuel of Hatred.NOT for America. Personal
how long politicians with money power will play with people's lives?
drumpf thinks he is above reproach. We don't buy his damn audit excuse, or any if other ones he gives us. 
#NotMyPresidentElect
There's no letter of audit.He can't produce a fake one or, IRS can legally get involved and call him liar.#FakeAudit!
. Even if there IS an audit, IRS says he can still show us his returns.
How come Carter never sold his peanut farm? #MAGA #TRUMP2020
Trust is not a control. And @realDonaldTrump has not earned ANYONE's trust...ever. I'm with Walter.
Stay on him Senator Warren!!  We LOVE you!!!
Yes @Heritage I explain to @SenWarren @OfficeGovEthics @POTUS we do not recognize the immigrant JPK agenda as US
JPK create @SEC_News to control NYSE.  What gov backs him? I literally do not know. @JebBush @nypost @SenWarren http://www.sechistorical.org/museum/galleries/kennedy/ …
..please get over the fact the Dems lost. Move on:let the country begin to heal
#ImpeachTrump #lockhimup
He wanted this position Let him pay for it. Donald just wants to better his bottom line.
Again what he does with what he worked his WHOLE Life for is NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS
3/ he does as a mattr of course in his busness & Court dealings. We don't WANT him in. IMPEACH!
2/ But if u don't IMMEDIATELY IMPEACH him,  he'll have gotten away w/o following the law just as
1/ If Trump wasn't willing 2 make REQUIRED sacrifice 2 become POTUS, he had no business running.
Must be retroactive.. Clintons, Kennedys, Bushes all must sell
my guess every asset highly leveraged and selling will give him no equity
if ONLY we cared in the slightest what you thought about anything!!!
@realDonaldTrump hey king trump, let's make a deal, u don't have to show your taxes if u divest your assets.  Deal?
We all have to make choices, and he made his. It had a high price tag he's now unwilling to pay.
See u in Wash. Beware.
Trump has not resolved his conflict of interest. He's just arranged for POTUS to be his FT day job instead of his side gig. 
Thank you.
@BrunoTheBridge @OfficeGovEthics What Shaub & u think are irrelevant. The law that covers this puts President #Trump above it.
Which politicians is contradicting himself most..,
Yet a totally corrupt Clinton #PayForPlay criminal emterprise was just fine & dandy w/you. Give us a break.

Trump money laundering. Please investigate.
10. Here is the smoking gun: US Treasury fined Trump's casinos $10 million for "significant, long standing anti-money laundering violations" 
He doesn't care about the Constitution- Giving companies to his sons will still be influential
I stand by Elizabeth Warren
@senDeanHeller voted w/ Dems.Hotels in Vegas conflict of interests? @federalreserve still doesn't have diversity
he's the one that chose to run
Not if the reason you're running is to get richer!
I'm with you Liz. If he wants to he POTUS he must divest.
please run for office in 2020 @SenWarren
so selling a  family owned biz worth billions at a loss not to high a price? #hysterical you 1st
Trump keeps thinking the Emoluments clause doesn’t affect him. Huge conflicts of interest.
@realDonaldTrump this is not serious for Trump -- this is a game -- "I won"!
Keep at it Elizabeth. A nation is depending on you.
Thank-you for your service! America strong!
wht is our liberal senators & ethics office saying.. fuggit?!! we demand he b held accountable!!
I was held to a higher standard as a US Contracting Officer.
But @realDonaldTrump son said the Office of the Executive was a step down for his father.
the problem is that our US Gov't is not holding him accountable. Watching America self-destruct
You are our only hope obi Warren Kanobe
He wants his cake and to eat it too
if he does he should just quit
@ProvaxShill @OfficeGovEthics @POTUS @YouTube he can step down....don't wanna put him out
B/c you dong have any money
keep fighting for America....no oath for trump.....russia will use puppet against US
This situation proves that he is incapable of planning ahead. He can't do the job!

@realDonaldTrump  Lizzy Here is my take on you. "Never underestimate the importance of a stupid person in a large  crowd" get the idea, pal?
it doesn't matter what you think it's what the law states
when Hillary Clinton is arrested then America can discuss ETHICS
#trump is writing his own laws already and he isn't even in office yet.
Hey @SenWarren, how about introducing a new Independent Prosecutor statute? There will be lots of law breaking in the next 1-2 years ...

A-men
Trump must decide the Country of his golden palace but not both. We're are the taxes
I concur! TOTAL divestment!
#Go away Liawatha
U woun't have worry about that because U will NEVER be POTUS unless the country wants a subversive!!!
Trump wants only to make money off the Office, he's already making money off of it. Divest or Impeach.
Liarwatha, put your money where your mouth is....and work for free.
shouldn't this have been considered prior to his running? Shows he never intended to win
Remember, Jimmy Carter gave up his beloved peanut farm when he became president.
Liz- no doubt you would claim to be something you're not - ethical?
what do u know about it u never earned anything
Liz, other than piss & moan what have you accomplished since taking office?
62,000,000 of us don't care about your idiotic point of view.
damn good idea for Senators too. Publish proof.
PLS Do your Jobs Uphold American Law & Values
@SenWarren @OfficeGovEthics @GrahamBlog @marcorubio
@JohnMcCain @SenatorCardin @CoryBooker
Wat are U ready to divest? Net worth $15M. McCaskill $30M? Hell i want to be a Sen. where do i sign-up?
Our County was bought by Billionaires Trump and his friends...

It's the LEAST that should happen. Especially with his obvious ties to foreign countries.
HE wanted to be PRESIDENT, HE should DO what is EXPECTED for the JOB!
. HYPOCRITE LIAR
hearings! We do not trust him and so he cannot lead!
if inaug he may purge ic, press access, lose others' trust/intel & he may use military fans
Yes! He ran for office, he knew the price that would be asked.
Understand-what you think doesn't matter. Work on stealing more cookbook recipes #realDonaldTrump #Read
This is going to be a true test of our inner strength
I've been held so workplace ethical tenets as a very small fish. This guy is apparently above it
Why did CGI stay in business?
I'm with u @OfficeGovEthics @POTUS @YouTube @realDonaldTrump divest and disclose your tax returns crooked donald!
we are talking about a man who thought his business success was an example of "sacrifice"
That is not what they said. And "I" doesn't belong in here. You serve at the pleasure of the people.
Trump is a train wreck.
Absolutely
I do. He's done more than required. I knew that you sore losers wouldn't be satisfied. Hillary would've kept Fdn
He hasn't done anything. What are you even talking about
Did you not see his press conference this morning? He's even donating all foreign profits to US Treasury!
He said he would donate the profits from foreign governments staying at his hotels. Thats not even close to "all foreign profits".
You people are never satisfied and I didn't hear that distinction.
You seem real clever
then hold this ego maniac accountable for something.
He is a national embarrassment and a threat to democracy
True
