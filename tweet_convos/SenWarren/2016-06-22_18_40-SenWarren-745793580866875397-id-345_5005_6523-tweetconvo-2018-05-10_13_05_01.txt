Nah. You should have one.
I'm sure Hillary would approve!  Nice work Liz!
Ypu mean the same people @HillaryClinton has taken millions from!?
I need to know, do you love her?  Why please why did you leave us?  My heart is broken.
No bill-no break?? MY RIGHTS ARE NOT TO BE INFRINGED!  BAN TERRORISTS!! Not guns!
My nephews father was born on a reservation, had no birth certificate, he has to prove his heritage, you refuse to.
Nothing like a liberal to use a tragedy for their own agenda..
really Ms. Native American
so far warren has never said an honest word -- generally what she says is opposite of facts
While Senate does absolutely nothing to stop Tyrant Obama, lock up HRC and deport your Bud SOROS!
@Twinny_RBLX @HouseGOP feigning those principles is all very nice, Warren, but if you were sincere, you would've supported Bernie
You speak as if her motives are false because of her inaction. Personally I think it is respectable that...
it's useful to remember to old adage is: "Actions speak louder than words."……
Therein lies the hypocrisy! If she were to endorse, she would be feeding into superdelegate corruption.
GOP last stop gap between Pharoah Obama lunacy of tyranny economic policies HYPOCRITE LYING STUPID senator
#NoBillNoBreak except for high end catering...
BS we all know the democrats are the ones more interested in cheating, you are the perfect example.
@SenWarren @HouseGOP
And you might be VP? I'd rather be dead.
Everything you say is a lie, so the opposite is true. #Democrats want to make it easier to cheat people
So I see you got that already.
Reid sat on over 300 bills without sending them forward, he FAILED AS YOU DO TOO
You really make liberal politicians look really bad.
I guess helping keep people alive isn't as important as ripping them off.
GOP gave up on ordinary Americans long time back to work as puppets of NRA, Rich 1%, CorruptCapitalists & RightWingNuts
@JHand4 @HouseGOP morons #goofy
yea the gop are a bunch of morons 
The legislation was flawed and even opposed by the ACLU for violating due process. A legal expert like yourself should know that.
dried up old crow
I've been sharing this great segement from @LastWeekTonight that talks about it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvZSpET11ZY … Worth a watch!
@YouTube yassss!! A brilliant piece. #Fiduciary
Any chance Obama (only branch with a sane party in power) could veto EVERY bill until a gun bill arrives on his desk?
look whose talking about cheating.. Disgraceful u r in Congress! @CNN @nytimes @FoxNews @latimes @veteranstoday
you are a liar!
You no longer have any credibility Warren.
#FunnyHow
I Voted for Donald Trump. So Why Am I in Elizabeth Warren’s Trump-Bashing Video? http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/06/elizabeth-warren-donald-trump-video-move-on-213987 …

Worth reading.
U WANT MCCARTHYISM BACK TO MAKE LISTS TO CONTROL US....IT DIDNT WORK THEN AND WON'T WORK NOW. #FRAUDOHONTAS DEMAND DNA!
If a Bill was not passed, why aren't you still in there? That is what #NoBillNoBreak meant didn't it? Dog 'n' pony show
people already have a choice to use a fiduciary or not #BigGovernment #Wampum
I'm a cop in my car paralyzed that my entire retirement just disappeared. Was leaving soon, disabled son to care for...
Don't Worry B Happy 
See predatory lenders and Debbie Wasserman Schultz. 
See DNC who endorses this. See both parties. Vote for Jill Stein!
thanks for all you do.
REALLY? With CATERED FOOD? How nice for your... sit in.
@SenWarren @HouseGOP
Typical. We can vote them OUT!
Your a typical demtwit
you rock!
They cheat us already. Thanks for trying to keep them honest Senator Warren! U R Great!
why not just call yourselves Party of Death - then list ur core values of how 2 annihilate ppl w variety of methods?
par for the course for them
Let us not confuse a bill aimed at the further surveilling Muslim Americans with real, meaningful gun control.
@robcrowe00 @HouseGOP since overwhelming people on watch list are Muslim...are the dems anti-Muslim?
if the House and its fan are so worried about civil liberties, why not get rid of that bu(ll)sh(it) list?
you know if the ACLU sides with GOP... It's a bridge too far
@robcrowe00 @HouseGOP the sponsors of all 4 bills admit it wouldn't have prevented Orlando #donothingdems
Oh really, the worst congress and weakest speaker thinks they know about legislating! #holdthefloor
I agree we could do better than Ryan... But Nancy(we have to pass it to find out what's in it)Pelosi. WHAT A TOOL!
@robcrowe00 @HouseGOP a do nothing bill fails in the senate & they do a sit-in (stunt) to strip people of due process....STUPID!
So good of you to support Sen Sanders long fought battle.
--This is why we need people like you in Legislature. You'll be toothless in Exec branch.
Would a good compromise be a bill that included both an assault weapons ban and a late term abortion ban? Too fanciful?
that's one more for Prudential selling shares in old airplanes to senior citizens at a swanky hotel with free food.
@fakedansavage @HouseGOP thank you...keep fighting for us...its you few you happy few who give us hope for good government
the GOP think humans are things to make money off of, their sense of humanity is governed by profit.
why can't the American people vote for this like the Brits are voting for Brexit?
@Tawanda46 @HouseGOP .@SenWarren YOU ARE A SELLOUT
WOULD FIGURE!!
You have NO right to preach, hypocrite! https://www.yahoo.com/news/harsh-foreclosure-critic-elizabeth-warren-reportedly-made-fortune-050708111.html …
@randyprine @HouseGOP that's because House #Republitards are only thinking of their lobbyist friends lining THEIR pockets
@randyprine @HouseGOP and leave me to starve
@SenWarren @HouseGOP
@jahimes @HouseGOP Well, #GOP that;s just what I want...
#nobillnobreak
dirt bags 4 sure ah believe there's Special Place 4 thoz who deliberately hurt humanity GOP RWNJS will b there
@fakedansavage @HouseGOP The Republican contempt for their fellow citizens is palpable.
Last Week Tonight did an excellent piece on this. John Oliver exposes it for what it is.  Profit driven exploitation.
Typical.  GOP moves to help out thieves.
Grandstanding, and standing for nothing. You democrats have hit a new  low. You are so transparent it's sickening.
Those nasty Rs-put ur belly on table n walk the talk vs nah nah nah-n y'all get paid 4 this bullying talk. How pathetic
Disgusting as usual
I wish every single American could grasp what the #GOP is pushing here. Beyond shameful. #partyoftrump
telling isn't it?
Truly awful day to be a Democrat. Was never this embarrassed of my party when I was a Republican between 2002-06! #StopTheStunt
Sadly I agree more w/ @HouseGOP o/ gun laws when #Senate can't do job and pass a good bill. #GOPNotAlwaysWrong SMH!
@GailSimone @HouseGOP pls, don't support unconstitutional watch lists. There are better ways to restrict guns, w/out xenophobia
Thank u 4 being there today to help #HouseDemocrats. #GunControlNow #SitInShutDownCongress #Enough #DisarmHate
#nomoresilence we can not be controlled by the NRA they have more power than we do. #demand the vote
@DrPizza @HouseGOP Why didn't the Dems handle guns in '09 when you controlled the WH, Senate & House. It mattered then, too...
@TheYoungTurks @HouseGOP Elizabeth, everything you say falls on deaf ears now.You proved w/ your HRC endorsement, youre insincere
Wow! Ur a real bernie bro. U arent fit to tie Warrens shoe laces. Sore losers make me sick.
hypocrites make me sick, so we're even. It's one thing to preach, it's another to pretend.
U mean like @BernieSanders pretending to his supporters that he was winning when he knew he wasnt.
Funny, Im pretty sure thats what Hillary was doing. Why cheat if she was winning.
Stop listening to #Republican propaganda. Even @BernieSanders knows she won fair and square.
Youre delusion should be marketed & sold OTC. Exit polls & collusion prove otherwise.
-  @HouseGOP never ceases to disgust me. They deserve the Cheeto-dusted fraudster that's ruining their party.
,thank you Elisabeth Warren, for all you do for are country.You are amazing.
@foreverbeach @HouseGOP oh might i suggest the dem hold your breaths till your faces turn blue and scream and stomp your feet
@foreverbeach @HouseGOP i doubt very seriously its any different then things the dems shoved down americans throats.#obamacare
just another day being a #gopsenator #forsale
@kharyp @HouseGOP Thank u Sen Liz.
You're the one who endorsed Wall Street's golden girl. If we can't count on you, why should the GOP strategy shock us?
Oh God another bernie bro sore loser. "Im mad cause my bernie lost". Waa waa! @BernieSanders lost..deal.
no surprise there.
crazy pocahontas... Sad you are taking advantage of the Orlando tragedy.
@matunos @HouseGOP Requiring a fiduciary relationship on all advisors is expensive & hard to enforce.
the only thing more expensive than an advisor with a fiduciary responsibility is an advisor without one
as for enforcement, I assume that comes mainly in the form of tort and certification
Certification goes speaks to ability, not behavior.  Just what we need more torts.
I mean losing certification, as say lawyers being disbarred
Oh boy, more lawsuits.  How about less regulation & buyer beware?
well don't just sit there STOP THEM
typical.   Criminals. How can you look in the mirror?  #Republicans #shameful
Sen.It won't go anywhere. It was a failed business model. I work within the fiduciary rule since January.
@OLCVTA @HouseGOP Anddd, still sit in or given up?
@AdamSessler @HouseGOP A whole day?  It ought only take 15 minutes to get a nation of 300 million to cast aside due process!
if they are redefining Fiduciary, DEMS can redefine LEADERSHIP. #DemsLeadTheWay
@AaronABCP @HouseGOP It's as if they've been dared to come off as cartoonishly villainous as possible. Unreal. #ShamefulGOP
You won't be any Addition to former-FLOTUS' Ticket.
thank you.
Oh, so they're prepping for Trump?
http://theemeraldmagazine.com/2015/11/my-bust-2/ …

you're an inspiration to outsiders wondering if the usa can be saved!
They have NO conscience They have NO sympathy. I wonder @ times if we R the same species; have we evolved differently?
ikr what a wuss
#StopTheStunt
.@SenWarren You're trying to make it easier for criminals to victimize people in their homes. Even if you aren't lying (HAHA), that's worse.
They don't care about the American people, only themselves. The rest of us can die off for all they care.
but at least that won't water down civil it's protections and due process.
Indeed they ought to be ashamed, and retirees ought to tell the House GOP. Thanks,Senator for all you do.You rock!
@VoteSanders2K16 @HouseGOP a whole day? Lots of people dont get breaks ANY day at work.
...by the people, for the people. No wonder that when ppl abroad ask me if I miss the States my answer is, "Not really"
@TheYoungTurks 
 you go girl. Why do we hold these GOP as equal minded when their opins are clearly batshit and harmful to citzns
we're tired of the tail wagging the dog,you're the tail,@realDonaldTrump is new big dog with no tail for you to grab
@Davidlaz @HouseGOP #RepublicanSenatorsRanAway
That's  a lie..
Does everything that comes out of your mouth a lie.
why don't you ever talk about things that matter, like cutting waste, fraud, spending and taxes?
@AdamSessler @HouseGOP so why don't you just scalp them?
@heysyd @HouseGOP yes, really. You have no right to take away my 2A, 1stA, 4thA or any constitutional rights. Get real.
Your rights aren't being taken away, @bduckss. ours are 
@SenWarren @HouseGOP #NoBillNoBreak #holdthefloor
no gun control measure since 2A written have stopped any mass shooting. Dems are emotional representatives.
#NoBillNoBreak glad you're representing the people Elizabeth Warren. Shame on the GOP. Do your job!
But of course they are...apropos for them. #poorpeople don't deserve nice things!!!
democrats have to keep some kind of conflict going to seem relevant democrats party of slavery,control,oppression
my response to their current disregard of the people's will? Have you no shame ladies and gentlemen? Have you no shame?
@texyellowdogdem @HouseGOP #Republicans are evil
Really RT @SenWarren: After whole day of #NoBillNoBreak, @HouseGOP is moving on vote to make it easier for retirement advisers to cheat ppl.
really? You are a one way street... Always bashing Wall Street blah blah..zero credibility. Delete your account already
@LisaToddSutton @HillaryClinton I use the @realDonaldTrump as my retirement adviser. He was highly recommended by Bernie Madoff.
can you believe this. Thanks Sen Warren for your message.
Give them hell #NoBillNoBreak
you tell it! @SenWarren
#Republicans have lost touch w/the Will of the People
#NoBillNoBreak #HoldTheFloor @SpeakerRyan

medical providers killed 4,000,000 americans in 16 years congress likes dead americans and those who kill
#ShameOnYouPaulRyan  letting the NRA rule over common sense gun control. #NoBillNoBreak #NoFlyNoBuy
ASSHOLES! BS behavior is why I am now  Democrat! I'm with President Obama and with Hilary!
@artist4ever @HouseGOP Luckily, the Override vote failed to carry which is why the House went right back into recess.
This from a woman who cheated her way into Harvard?
To quote the Church Lady, their own mascot: Well, isn't that special? #typical #ofcoursetheyare
When are the American people going to wake up to how the #Republicans are destroying this once great country..
Proud of you Senator Warren. Taking a stand for the real people in this country.  Your colleagues are disappointments
@jonnyysandmann @HouseGOP Epic hypocrisy of "sit-in" because the @NRA hasn't bribed neoDems equally, like the #ClusterBomb lobby
#DumpTrump 
#DumpRyan #DumpGOP
#CommonSenseGunLaws #UnitedStates
you have no right to talk about these things.
so disgusted!
We are ashamed of you @elizabethforma @SenWarren 
#Independents and #progressives didn't rally for decisiveness! 
@bravenewfilms @HouseGOP
Yes, because all retirement advisors, every single one, are out to cheat people. Socialist. How's your fat pension Liz?
Come on #Democrats! Don't just sit in! Go on a hunger strike!
I am so proud of you all! Hang in there!!!
@MrBudSmith What's wrong w the @HouseGOP ? Have they lost their moral compass? Do they have individual conscience? Use it.
@ManMet80 @SenWarren @MrBudSmith @HouseDemocrats  THE @HouseGOP and @SpeakerRyan have 4gotten this is the #PeoplesHouse
.@SenWarren
You're just pushing to make the cartels richer instead of "retirement advisers".
LIz, how far from your house is the nearest crack dealer? How far is the nearest illegal alien?
Political theater is  seldom useful.Look what is happening in Senate with McCain amendment!!!! You are losing focus!
you have no idea what your talking about. But keep shoveling it to your followers they eat it up.
#UniteBlue - we got this.
#Sikovit! @SenWarren @HouseGOP
