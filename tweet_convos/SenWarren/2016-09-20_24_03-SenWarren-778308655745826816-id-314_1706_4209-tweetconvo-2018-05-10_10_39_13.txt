The employees should also be jailed and forced to return the money they fraudulently took.
They were following direction by the company. Yes, they should lose their jobs (they did), but no jail. @SenWarren @WellsFargo
An employee knowingly committs a crime-they're guilty. They had a choice, get another job, report crime
I'm not sure they knew it was a crime. I would much rather JD/SEC go after those who set the policy.
Not certain you fully appreciate what the fraud entails.  
Read:
I do. But thanks for your concern. I just don't want the authorities to be sidetracked w/ the little fish.
Average salary was $300k, bonus $800k. Anyone making that kind of $ isn't a small fish. Customers are.
$12/hr employees are small fish, as Sen Warren referenced. Those are the ones I'm talking about.
How much money did you make at Harvard while lying about your background while we are on the subject. @SenWarren @WellsFargo
oh yeah great correlation. (Read sarcasm)
You have decimated the  @WellsFargo stock with your efforts. That's the way to do it because that's the language banks understand
So other shareholder, pensioners, employee stock option holders don't matter?! Her approach is shameful!
No they don't matter. Share price boosted on cross selling was faulty anyway. @WellsFargo
fake cross selling isnt  real value, but x selling per se can be.
Exactly. Fake cross selling is what she is going after. Acquaint urself on the subject before becoming a twitter warrior
I am aware , u snob. NOT what she kept saying! She called x selling per se a "scam" over and o VER! I watched the hearing!
Angry white loud mouth women . . . the new Nancy Pelosi. You and your failed liberal policies should resign .
We heard you scream and yell about Hillary, then turn around and endorse her. No one believes you anymore. #DemExit
@HillaryLostMe @SenWarren Warren wrote Hillary asking her TO RUN 4 PRES & you think she wasn't going to support her? Fool
1) Like as if she wasn't going to run anyway, 2)http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/07/hillary-clinton-elizabeth-warren-vice-president-tpp … 3) She signed a letter 1/2
2/2 written by other female dem's.Kinda like putting her feet 2 fire. 4) Whats w dems and name calling?
She started by supporting her. She also praised HRC Wall St plan. Your imagination got better of you
She also praised Climate Plan but that was gutted as soon as Sanders endorsed.. sooooooo......
Yes give it to house homeless  ppl

Thank you for your efforts with WF hearings.  I am a lifelong banker that resigned from WF because of ethics. WF= Evil Empire
. Agreed. Wells Fargo did a car loan for me and gave it to my father-in-law without my knowledge.
Amen.What despicable behavior
#WellsFargo for your sake best hope dirt doesn't start being dug up on u. How is support #HRC not supporting the same u chastise?
lesser of 2 bad eggs in your mind?
Interesting how T***p has remained silent throughout this debacle. If elected, will he call Stumpf "a fine CEO"?
that's not enuf, senator. U should run after bank CEOs & ratings agencies responsible 4 the 2008 financial crisis
You are the hammer! Way to hold this criminal to fire. More people like you are needed.
Can he just pay my mortgage off? We're straight after that. Corruption in big companies like this needs to STOP!
why can't he be forced to!?
thank you Elizabeth for doing your job. CEO Stumpf should not resign, he should be fired and criminally investigated.
If Stumpf doens't resign, the people should send a message by closing their accounts. #holdWFaccountable #closeyouraccount
Thank you Senator Warren!
It's time the real crooks and scam artists pay for their crimes against humanity. No more theft! No more liars!
I saw it on CSPAN EW. Great job! But, I hope there's more to be done!!
lock him up!
if there's anything we learned after the 2008 Bush bailout, it's that these guys never answer for their crimes.
thank you @WellsFargo shame on you!
Hillary Clinton Campaign Systematically Overcharging Poorest Donors
and rehire the workers that followed his orders and were fired.
w back pay
SenWarren good/what she does~FinWorldCritique;FAIL2seeSocJustice~HCcutsJFK/LBJ Progs+Elig>Inequal&ElimRFKconstnSppts
even if he resigns he'll receive $123.6M in severance, while everyday Americans struggle to make ends meet.
Watching a politician chastise a banker is like watching Bill Cosby reprimand Brock Turner.
John Stumpf IS GUTLESS AND A CRIMINAL. 
THOSE 5300 @WELLSFARGO employees and their managers should be in jail.
.@SenWarren @PoliticalBee @WellsFargo @lorax58 U did give a compelling "Stumpf" speech!!! Please FOLLOW THRU!!!
. . . and so should @HillaryClinton! How'd she get all that money? Being a politician?
so should you Senator for lying about your Native American heritage!
Agreed! Way to go Senator Warren; #bullshit on Stumpf!
thank you Warren !
I sent an internal email to stumpf yesterday asking for his resignation and offered myself as temporary CEO replacement
John Stumpf has the kind of garbage mentality that is ruining this country. He is not worth his weight in dirt.
Instead of waiting in vain for bankers to "hold themselves accountable" why not put a few in jail. Works wonders.
Senator, you were right to rip Stumpf a new one.
The spineless POS needs to hire back all those low level employees that were shamelessly fired.
@ClintonFdn should close down and return WF cash!
Can you also go after Jon Corzine, who ripped off his customers to the tune of $1 billion? What? Suddenly silent?
he's an amateur. The Clintons manage to get one quarter of that with only two people!
If he was truly sorry he would have returned my home at 1080 Noble Lane, SJ. CA, 95132. Six years homeless.
not only should he resign, he should be forced to return what he earned through bonus and shares and also be charged
St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported Wells Fargo Foundation had given between $100,000 and $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation
CRIMINALLY PROSECUTED is more of the  TERMINOLOGY
In honor #internationaldayofpeace unfriends of #ComradeTrump
 Posted a meme
The Dons of money laundering: Don King used boxing/gambling, Don Trump used real estate/gambling/charities @WellsFargo
Donald John Trump's original family name is Drumpf. Is @WellsFargo CEO John Jumpf a conman cousin? Putting the umpf in fraud.
6.5 million lost their homes. Now my Mom is losing hers. Help us help her. #foreclosuremanual #CultureofFraud
Call for the same in the IRS, EPA VA and OPM or you're a flaming hypocrite.   @SenWarren @WellsFargo
@rsheridan9 @WellsFargo They have back every cent plus millions more and fired those responsible.
he made over $200 million on his personal stock shares during this scam. Why doesn't he give it back?
@tkdmike @WellsFargo I'm long time customer and stockholder but not for long if he doesn't resign.
 Now can u make this happen?
Let's Get Started. Thank You Senator!
glass houses are not sturdy. Run a business then judge others
Agreed, if someone/people/company steals millions from others, that's a crime.
We both know shit won't happen to him @SenWarren @WellsFargo
CEO earned 19.3 million. Likely +30Xs the employees he incentivized to commit fraud. Claw back$!
As should you and the rest of the traitors in our government! Soon enough...
YES!!! Not only resign and give back the money he ripped off from workers that got tossed aside but tarred&feathered!
Wells Fargo should relocate to Mexico...
only after Warren resigns for putting our nation so far in debt... while demanding more of my money to spend.
@normangoldman @WellsFargo Preach!!
closing all my 8 bank accounts today!
#Jail4WFCexecutives
Hearing "performance" was a joke! UR an ignorant, hateful bigot! A hypocritical clown! Scolding WF as Clintons helped create 2008
Yes and our senators should work on that "too big to fail" thing. Remember?
Why isn't he being criminally investigated?
Forget  $$ penalties. ..Executives FEAR AND HAVE EARNED JAIL TIME!!!
He doesn't care who got fired! He can't even answer a simple yes or no question!!!
~ You  nailed Senator!  Now don't let up!  Also, I think we learned what fraud means in 6th grade. #ridiculous
Wells Fargo being judged by this Liar?? Haha how can such a liar judge anyone, go away Warren you snake!!
Clinton should resign and be in prison! Elizabeth is NOT native and should resign for outrageous lies!
based on what?

GOP senators are so outraged by Wells Fargo’s fraud they want to eliminate the agency that uncovered it .#VoteBlue  http://www.vox.com/2016/9/20/12989688/wells-fargo-cfpb …

Just words. Let's see you follow up.
The Board, too. Based on what I heard yesterday, there's no way they weren't culpable.
You first    #snakeknowsasnake
Shareholders should sell, and customers find another financial institution
Screw You Warren.  What have u EVER done to create a single job?
John Stumpf lacks integrity, decency, honesty, and empathy.  He should resign.
I was one of those who paid fees on an account that I did not authorize.  Senator Warren...thank you!
Which is why we need a complete Democratic Congress.
These Republican cowards like thieves.
One executive perp walk would put an end to this once and for all.
Maybe we should worry about gov't officials caught red-handed before we worry about companies, i.e. @HillaryClinton
.@SenWarren .@WellsFargo  SO true! People that are dishonest should resign. IE - lying about being native american and not being rich.
and you should resign your senate seat for being a liar. and Hillary should end her career for the same reason.
Thank you Elizabeth! The guts to tell the truth!
Quite frankly, I think you should BOTH resign for being deceptive. Yeah, Warren...the Indian of the senate. Sure.
your Tweet was quoted in an article by @washingtonpost
Can't the individual states revoke the charters for these banks?
Agreed, well done Senator.
: you should be ashamed of yourself. You are all corrupted and being corrupted can't clean up corruption!
Dear Wells Fargo...I would take credit for success when the economy is good and blame the economy when not successful
Dear Wells Fargo...I could perform equally as well as Mr. Stumpf for 1/2 the salary.  Golden parachute required.
Good to see you have the American publics back and jail time sounds good...
you back HRC-uncharged criminal and yet you call out someone else?  Step down form congress or hold HRC accountable.
how about we fire IRS and VA administration employees who failed or colluded? Hmmmmm
The 'government' already decided that in his case fraud is not a crime. Those campaign contributions are paying off.
you should too
finally something i can agree with you on......it is UNREAL what this company did....total rip off
Agreed on Stumpf but Ms. Warren, I believe the same should happen to Carrie Tolstedt. She was not fired for a reason.
Until you admit that you lied regarding your ethnicity NO ONE IS TAKING YOU SERIOUSLY
colloquial truth-pot meet kettle #irandeal
They were investigating themselves and had already fired over 4000 before Feds stepped in. This is just a shakedown
this is but one scam this company has perpetuated, nobody wants to hear about the others.
If the government is unwilling to prosecute @WellsFargo's lawbreaking, the people MUST BOYCOTT - starve bad companies of cash.
I agree but the Govt has to step in. CEO won't say sorry
#Agreed
Senator, you did a great job today!  Bravo! I admire your tenacity &  diligence to nail John Stumpf & WF
But he won't be @SenWarren and @WellsFargo and the other banks will continue to do whatever they want until they collapse the economy again
As a comparison, China routinely applies capital punishment for similar crimes... No justification for EITHER extreme
bankers should be banned from lobbying just like the GSEs.
Thank you. It was great to see Senators on both sides of the aisle criticize the obscene fashion in which Wells Fargo has behaved
@de0anima @WellsFargo Silly Funny...It's raining Stumpfs and Drumpfs Greed #StrongerTogether
interesting
we know that's not going to happen because Wall Street still owns the govt
Thumbs up Senator!
maybe he should be charged just like Hillary!
you should give the American people back all the money the DNC has taken from donors for a set up primary!
@lheinkel so when r u going to give back the $ u took from all your special interest?#Democrats #PJNET #MAGA #TCOT
Ms. Warren I applaud you! Not a dem, but I would back you! You should be running, not Hillary.
Maybe you should worry about the FBI missing terrorists instead of a private company @WellsFargo
Yes he should.
WF CEO should be criminally indicted. Your example of a worker stealing a fist full of $20s  vs  stealing billions was riveting..
is looking 4 new biz, exam @HillaryClinton @genebsperling and @POTUS 4 stealing FNMA wealth.
you are the pot calling the kettle black.....with your lies and I'll gotten education your ass should be in prison..
I agree Senator. Thank you for constantly fighting for the American people. How do we help you bring him to justice ?
No, you resign first, then the rest of the criminals! Come on, set the example!
Including the $$ WellsFargo took via higher interest rates on loans to people whose credit they ruined.
@theTonyGee Maybe you could, I don't know, FIGHT for more funding for DOJ?
I am old enough to remember when Bush prosecuted enrol execs and tyco.  Ohh and Martha Stewart.  Your turn Obama.
Sounds like a relative of Donald Drumph #Maddow #TheCloserGQ #lastword #Dipshit #AMJoy #hardball #RealTime
I have #IntensePublicInterest in what happens now!!??
I agree. Disgraceful. But If you can’t make it happen, Senator, who the hell will???
and go to jail without collecting two hundred dollars! Hell yeah!
I have #intensepublicintetest
Under that proviso the entire Congress should be replaced for ineffectiveness and lying to the American public.
- @WellsFargo #8isGreat #8isGr8 
.@SenWarren @WellsFargo also all the employees fired should file a big law suite!
shouldn't the same thing be done to someone who lied to get into college??????
So let's make it happen !  What can we do?  Now???
Get the head of the VA Koskinen to quit THEN u  done sumthin.
@onderick_onder3 @WellsFargo Elizabeth Warren is obsess with Wall Street&because of that she will never get anywhere too far.
@onderick_onder3 @WellsFargo what a stupid accusation.She wants to connect everyone to Wall street&she is seeking for presidency.
yes, he "should." If only there was some governmental agency, or agent, that could make it happen.  #talkischeap
@Saberghoff @WellsFargo absolutely this is why folks are sick of big banks doing things that ultimately hurt us 
you rock EW
Amen! Ditto for Hillary Clinton.
you oughta check out the IRS and EPA.
Lied to get Harvard job that pays $350,000, & lives in a 5 million dollar mansion.  #fraud
so should you
https://www.facebook.com/senatorelizabethwarren/videos/648853398610490/ …
Does this not fall under the Sorbanes Oxley Act that would hold him criminally responsible for this fraud?
5300 @WellsFargo employees who committed the actual fraud should be charged. Why haven't you called for that?
@Nating3 @WellsFargo same rhetoric as 2008 election.  Who went to jail? Post that link
you spelled Hillary Clinton wrong
Did you say the same thing about the people in charge of the IRS and VA scandals?
Why don’t you demand the members of the IRS that screwed conservatives because of their opinions resign?
I fully agree.
hey CHIEF, r u going to give the $$ back to Harvard that you took when U lied about being Native American!
Too bad ..You should feel the exact same way about Hillary!!!
what about your buddy hilldawg?
*yawn*
Too bad you wasn't this concerned during your failed tenure as TARP oversight committee chairman....
Fauxcahontis complaining about someone scamming... Oh my sides, I'm laffin.
SHOULD.....SHOULD... but what is actually going to happen? Not a goddamn thing.
I need to change mortgage carriers!
I still support you, but you should have sided with @SenSanders and things would have been fixed
You mean actually take responsibility and pay the consequences??  Not sure CEOs ever do that, LOL
What's WFargo doing for victims?  Do fired mgrs & employees have personal info (SSNs, DOB, etc) to steal identities?
That's all good and well, but what laws will you pass to stop it?
YOU SHOULD GIVE THE JOB YOU STOLE FROM A REAL MINORITY BACK TO A NATIVE AMERICAN
BUT YOU ENDORSE WALL ST OWNED GLOBALIST HILLARY CLINTON. POCAHONTAS SPEAKUM WITH FORKED TONGUE
#maga #trumptrain
@bridgettlthomp @SenWarren @WellsFargo 
Warren should give back all the benefits she got from claiming she's native American Indian.
Sounds exactly like what should happen to @HillaryClinton
Please make sure hilLIARy does the same #PayToPlay  Why you are at it Pocahontas pay your grant $ back too #integrity
truth
not going to happen mean while we continue to get a 2% raise, won't even throw employees a Christmas party.
