As Hillary's side kick, you have tossed progress down the toilet. No hillary no way.
@SenWarren @amprog
WOW 4 a progressive who spoke out against wallstreet&money in gov you have now endorsed their preferred candidate
Yes Amerika we need more Progressives. The last 8 years will prove how well they have fixed the broken system.
The dems have had eight years of failure. We don't need any more of your "progressive" Policies.
Are you aware @amprog runs biggest corp #revolvingdoor in DC? They push school privatization under guise of "civil rights" #noway
Hows it feel to be a lyin thief Liz? How can you live with yourself?
everyone hates you #warren, please resign
I feel sick. I knew it was bad but this is EGREGIOUS!
shut up and go home. You're nothing more than a Hillary stooge at this point
Too bad your not progressive #Sellout #ZeroSec #ZeroSellOuts
I know that you couldn't POSSIBLY see HRC as Progressive. Ms. Warren...we ALL know that you're more intelligent than this
Where have we heard increase competition & enforce anti trust laws? It wasn't Hillary.
Not sure why @SenWarren tweeted this when @BernieSanders REPEATEDLY provided progressive competition policIES...more than once!
@mphoenixempire Anybody who supports Killary is NOT a progressive. @DrJillStein @BernieSanders @TulsiGabbard @ninaturner
@SenWarren @amprog
@SenWarren @amprog
Why are you backing Clinton if you are a Progressive.
Great!  Only Donald Trump has a clue to make America competitive.  HILLARY DOES NOT HAVE A CLUE.  WAKE UP, PLEASE.
You are not progressive #Sellout
progressives don't know how to compete
You talk a good game but that's all you are. Talk talk talk. You're not progressive but you are a sellout. Judas Warren!
It will never happen too much money in politics, you are on the wrong side.
@SenWarren @amprog
@SenWarren @amprog
why arent you talking about elections fraud
our country needs a government/leaders that actually understand how fiscal and monetary policy actually work.
@kharyp @amprog Sell Out!! #hillaryforprison
Another argument is that competition is what drives differential advantage to the point where government is bought.
get off twitter Warren. Go do your job. Twitter isnt your job.
#StillSanders
You sold yourself out for nothing. Hillary will not be the next prez. What a waste.
you back the wrong person.SELLOUT
well OUR COUNTRY doesn't need you
It's a Free Market you psycho..
because there has to be an opposition to common sense!
#sellout
You really ought to pull a DWS & stay out of sight You are now adding to our reasons not to vote Hillary
@DanScavino progressive n competition ... Oxymoron for Ds.
Love it that you share in depth information about complex economic issues. Heavy read but oh so worth it. #ImWithHer
you sure let me down I thought you're a good person now you are with Hilary
you're a nut job!  And you should switch to decaf.  Oh, and ... shut up and go away.
@CAPAction @amprog How do you think we got here? We don't need MORE progressivism; we need a lot less!
Future VP Warren, based on number of Trump & Bernie haters,  you're doing a great job. Let's show them true greatness!
Too bad you have nothing to show for it..
@SenWarren @amprog
progressive policy is not backing bought corporatist candidates like @HillaryClinton
mnimmmm
pig
@SenWarren @amprog
you went from top shelf to the dollar store in one move. That was very sad to watch.
I'm not sure anyone likes Elizabeth Warren. More negative tweets then Donald Trump. Guess she's not fooling anyone
@SenWarren @amprog
let's rebuild this country. need jobs? no better way then to fix what's broken. never ever Trump. never that desperate
Bernie Sanders------supporters don't have anything in common with Hillary Clinton

real #Progressive while #PushingAndPandering for #Hillary she is non progressive even u thought so but she paid u #BernieOrBust
Bring back GlassSteagall, replace Free trade with Fair trade, & 4 yrs from now I may believe they're not using you, Sen.
@SenWarren
blah blah blah...you so hillary.
Trump's policies are more trickle-down econ &  adds $30 trillion to deficit. Dems cut yearly deficits GOP recklessly adds
Trump has some GREAT PLANS!! AMERICA FIRST!
I voted for you to be in the senate. And now you sold your sole to the devil and the corporate funded candidate #sellout #traitor
(1/2) @Absolutely47 @SenWarren HRC voted for DOMA, voted for the Iraq war, voted for NAFTA, she voted for 2001 bankruptcy bill
(2/2) @SenWarren she voted in 2006 4 the continue cluster bombing in civilian areas, she is 4 for profit prison, 4 the death penalty. +more
that's why you should have supported the real progressive candidate @BernieSanders.
lol as if Clinton democrats did not cut welfare and housing in the 1990's
There is nothing progressive about it. It is regressive bank run communism you advocate
- "progressive competition" - more esoteric gobbledigook.
We also need Bernie Sanders as our president.
you go for VP @HillaryClinton
You used to be pretty damned progressive yourself. What happened?
can't believe you sold out
vice president
