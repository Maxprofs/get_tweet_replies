Congress needs to be paid by the hrs actually worked & like all p/t workers not get paid benifits either. :(
unproductive workers get fired as do absentee workers.  Why have we not reduced compensation 4 these do-nothings?
hey poco, didn't the democrats sit on the floor protesting? Get a grip, and continue to lie. Dems are best at lies

And funny how GOP'ers endlessly complain nothin ever gets done in D.C. Yet they have become master obstructionists
sen Warren wants to talk about last min blow offs when her homie @MassAGO pulled the same stunt on her own people.
Amazing how fast they act if it serves their interest, or how slow to serve the people!
Hookers & blow?
repeal the bottle bill.  Illegal immigrants are making money tax free and using our services.  Stores turn us away.

It seems there's always enough time to screw over the electorate!

Is there a list of attendance? Who can we vote out? Who should we keep?
Congress hasn't moved this fast since the â€™13 bill to end Sequester flight delays (because they hated being in line)
sickening
how do you feel about Bill raping and abusing women for so long and Hillary shaming them.

if you had to work a real job most of you would fail!  Let's switch jobs for a week and see who works harder
Republicans have been just about the most useless bunch of cake-eating oxygen soakers to ever hit Washington.
They voted to give tax breaks to the wealthiest 1% of child abducting forest clowns
It's amazing that people cry for change, but they don't want to change Congress.
true congress should have term limits sick of seeing carrer politics "who know what's best for us"
hopefully little Paulies Do Nothing Congress will get voted out in Nov!
why do these jokers even have jobs?  Their lack of decency is disgusting.
