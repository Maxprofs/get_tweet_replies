You must mean Hillary's advisers.

The same shady financial advisers that paid Hillary speaking fees? Hypocrites both of you.
and this is why WE need you Elizabeth. Seniors rely on you.
@Mother_Rell @SpeakerRyan @USDOL You endorsed a shady financial corrupt crook Liz happy now that GOP crooks are all endorsing her
Hillary would steal the workers retirement! When did she help workers and champion women?
like Hillary
What can we do to investigate people like @SpeakerRyan if we believe he is taking bribes from the NRA?
if you're a member of the GOP, if you're Republican you will do nothing at all, answer; nothing at all
@HarperRausch Caveat Emptor.
Some things never change. .
You mean he is killing a bill that limits choice? Terrible. Please protect us Elizabeth, change my diapers
ok let's get back to your native Indian claim
Apparently Lizzie wants shady governmental bureaucrats to be the only ones with access to workers' money
.@SenWarren @SpeakerRyan @USDOL Clinton's best bud in the DNC, DWS, has no problem with supporting shady financial advisers.
I remember your interview w/ bill Moyers. Now u r stumping 4 wall st candidate who's under FBI criminal investigation ? 
@bigkuntry57 @SpeakerRyan @USDOL You have like maybe One Non Shady Financial Advisor.  He's poor and miserable.
@bigkuntry57 @SpeakerRyan @USDOL we go Forward in universe sharing Narcotics and intruding them to new species.
@bigkuntry57 @SpeakerRyan @USDOL Potential actually sensible fixes, "Mass Probings, Lemmingside©®™, My way.
@bigkuntry57 @SpeakerRyan @USDOL in the dying words of MLK, "Wake up, eat sh!t, work hard, for nothin!" Not ML King.
@bigkuntry57 @SpeakerRyan @USDOL Everyone run into the ocean and play with the Dolphins.  Oh they "love" to play.
@bigkuntry57 @SpeakerRyan @USDOL current agendas followed the best thing USA Citizens could do is "Lemmingside."
@bigkuntry57 @SpeakerRyan @USDOL Fighting for Healthcare for vets when the vets being cared for "Want to Die?"
@bigkuntry57 @SpeakerRyan @USDOL Attacking children whom put the square block in the square hole.  That's real.
@bigkuntry57 @SpeakerRyan @USDOL Basing a system on trust and giving it those who consistently prove they are not?
+Trustworthy.
@bigkuntry57 @SpeakerRyan @USDOL Not one Sensible Fix for any Crisis or Issue.  Two Wrong Fixes argued over?
ryan is crazy
#FunnyHow
I Voted for Donald Trump. So Why Am I in Elizabeth Warren’s Trump-Bashing Video? http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/06/elizabeth-warren-donald-trump-video-move-on-213987 …

Worth reading.
anything that'll continue to feed their greed is what they'll approve for themselves
No problem. Have #Trump brand him a Muslim and banish him from the squalid kingdom he may preside over. @CNN
Funny ur worried about their retirement when ur helping bankrupt social security and Medicare.
Politicians are the problem!
also, @SpeakerRyan: if you wanted to not look like a total jerk, pick a different bill while the whole country is watching cspan
luckily, @POTUS already vetoed it, and @HouseGOP couldn't do anything about it. Fools. Thank you, Pres Obama!
AZ state teacher retirement annuity got in trouble when ENron happened. Extra $$ out of our chks for loss
how about a bill protecting us from shady politicians?  Got one of those to vote on? Of course not!!
@TheYoungTurks @SpeakerRyan @USDOL #FallowTheMoney #corruption is at play
Ya, wouldn't want what happened to #SocialSecurity to happen to 401k's
So nice to see where the GOP's alliances are....not with us that is for sure.  Vote out the GOP.
@sweetbay @SpeakerRyan @USDOL All the while your sitting on your bums, cutting lights, killing mics, & singing our rights away...
<<< he has NO SOUL IN fact he's evil @USDOL
thank you for consistently calling out the GOP on their inaction on important issues and their concern for only their own $$$$
@Margoandhow @HunterHRC2016 I believe Sen Warren 100%. Repubs have never thought of little people - just $$$
@TamiMcKnight12 @SpeakerRyan @USDOL 
...sad...
Im getting all misty!
and you endorsed @HillaryClinton your clearly daft
Did he watch HBO's #LastWeekTonight with #JohnOliver. I certainly learned how much we're losing. @SpeakerRyan @USDOL
Ryan allowing Wall St to say tell them anything just get their money and they do...you need to be a fiduciary
@jedbettman @SpeakerRyan @USDOL 
You have created over a hundred trillion dollars in unfunded liabilities and you're the expert??
how can @SpeakerRyan turn off lights&cameras? That's the People's House not His House
@MikeJUofA @SpeakerRyan @USDOL He wants us broken!  He hates our voices! #NoBillNoBreak #NRAmoneyIsBloodMoney #doyourjobcongress
Yes he did, because his personal mission is to further degrade the working class, protect NRA & elect Trump
@xdelmar59 @SpeakerRyan @USDOL GOP. they are all assholes
oh yes, more wisdom from #fauxcahontas
He is the snake in the basket she is his charmer.
A hateful and disgusting bill. What kind of people would vote yay?
Maybe you should come to order and vote.
, and Rs slither off into night, after shameful day. Not much new here. They have their goals too
@POTUS will veto if necessary. All theatre of the absurd, final act.
Thank u, Senator Warren.
Ms Warren, we need to vote these people out of office.
happy birthday XOXOXO <3 @UncommonJose @SpeakerRyan @USDOL
as an american living abroad,i have to say,im disgusted with the way Ryan's carrying himself,to me hes nothing more than a P.O.S.
@BobbyVanD22 disarm plan source and FWA
@PopRockSpaceboi @SpeakerRyan @USDOL He is the devil...I hope he burns in Hell
@bannerite @SpeakerRyan @USDOL mercy sticking it to the working citizens of the u.s.
It was the night before Christmas...2009.  Never forget.
Alternative tweet from @SenWarren could've said: GOP votes down rule by unelected bureaucrats in @USDOL that would send more jobs to Mexico
For all the world to see...the GOP voted to allow financial advisors to manipulate investors.
@JasonLaCanfora @SpeakerRyan @USDOL can we have a bill on fake Indian con artists?
@Amy_Siskind @SpeakerRyan @USDOL #Gilligan
some who refuse to see- think everyone else is blind...
@ninatypewriter @SpeakerRyan @USDOL that seems important 
@SenWarren @SpeakerRyan @USDOL
@JasonLaCanfora @SpeakerRyan @USDOL You need to shut that SOB down...union buster, pension stealer..he's a prick
Maybe the protections needed but RULE, not law, may be flawed. Most financial advisors are not crooks #dol
He's so out of touch it's sad.
SHAME ON SPEAKER RYAN. HE IS A DISGRACE TO HIS OFFICE AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE ENTIRE GOP IS CORRUPT.
@Dudette9t9 he is a traitor to anything decent
The CORRUPT GOP is FOR SALE and PAID FOR by the special interests against the people that elect them.
@JasonLaCanfora @SpeakerRyan @USDOL gotta love the @GOP always lining their pockets and screwing the middle and lower classes
@JasonLaCanfora @SpeakerRyan @USDOL wow a Warren retweet. The faux Indian. Finally pushed me to an unfollow
@JasonLaCanfora @SpeakerRyan @USDOL Speaker Ryan is a pathetic little man. Sold out America to the #NRA
@dmatkins137 @SpeakerRyan @USDOL makes me so mad I am off the reservation!
@JasonLaCanfora @SpeakerRyan @USDOL that doesn't sound like Speaker Rgan too me  You must be confused as usual
@JasonLaCanfora @SpeakerRyan @USDOL and your party is trying to kill due process
@JasonLaCanfora @SpeakerRyan @USDOL You are all crooks. Why people support any of you is beyond belief.
Shame on Repubs for that vote and for blocking any gun control leg vote. How do they sleep at night?
I'm sure the $40k @SpeakerRyan got from Bershire over the last couple months had nothing to do with it.
@JasonLaCanfora @SpeakerRyan @USDOL Who determines how much is too much shadiness? What is too much shadiness?
@ohuhbubb @SpeakerRyan @USDOL oh does that include @HillaryClinton too?
@JasonLaCanfora @SpeakerRyan @USDOL okay Pocahontas
@TheYoungTurks @SpeakerRyan @USDOL "Shady financial advisors" aka "My new patrons"
Your silence on @Citibank+Hillary = complicity
Thank God the Democrats are shining a light on the corrupt callousness if the GOP.
@MiaFarrow @SpeakerRyan  Ryan doesn't care if we get shot or our savings stolen.
@adamisalamb @SpeakerRyan @USDOL Probably got advice from his buddy Scott Act 10 Walker...
No, it's more government intrusion. We can think for ourselves. Don't need Big Brother Barry & co.'s help.
@ballerinaX @SpeakerRyan @USDOL cote the bums out. #GOP must go.
.@SenWarren @SpeakerRyan @USDOL This is preposterous. I hope it fails.
#HouseDems, Pls #NoBillNoBreak #NoFLyNoBuy #backgroundchecks THANKS!.
GOP not doing their jobs AGAIN
of course. He's a gutless coward
2016 is going to be a referendum on nonsense and bullsh*t. #NoBillNoBreak #holdthefloor @SenWarren @SpeakerRyan @USDOL
paul is gutless. But untill someone kills a member of his family he cares less about anyone elses. Get himout
@Eykis @SpeakerRyan @USDOL not surprising
@upuouo @SpeakerRyan @USDOL this is unamerican to cut works future. More for rich?
Outraged!
another one of those half-truths
@DLoIndustries @SpeakerRyan @USDOL He is an embarrassment to Wisconsin voters
You would be surprised how many of us are watching. The GOP is so owned by money and the NRA.
the only time the GOP and Speaker Ryan work, is to pass legislation that further decimates the middle class!
Of course he did. #cowardlyryan
still trying to figure out how to get gov't hands on these accounts?
oh the things they've leaned from....China govt.?
@MaggieJordanACN @SpeakerRyan @USDOL pretty hard to have that vote tonight thanks to Democrats. Just saying. Both sides suck
@Genosworld @SpeakerRyan @USDOL can you attach some #CommonSenseGunLaws to it?
We need to retire Paul Ryan!
@retiredfirstsgt @SpeakerRyan @USDOL hope it fails big time
Repubs-yuk 
When do they vote you out? Next election, or will they oust you first? You are irrelevant. Kindly fade away with Obama.
no shame
, because they are increasing Funding to Extend the NDAA.
are the republicans stupid or just so Intrenched in obstruction that they only know how to say No?
The Republicans want something they can vote FOR, not AGAINST. No matter how inconsequential.
Hope it fails.
is this the fiduciary one that @LastWeekTonight talked about? Insane, @SpeakerRyan
GOP Representatives are turning off their office phones & blocking online messaging. Completely un-American.
Last week @SpeakerRyan phones: Press 1-4 to lv msg abt A,B,C,D. 5 to hear Ryan's msg on 2A. Clearly says not listening 2U
Wow I didn't think it was possible to be as ineffective as Boehner but @SpeakerRyan proves me wrong!
something is seriously wrong with some of our elected officials!
expect nothing less from spineless Ryan.  Do-nothing govt, should be ashamed
he should know the people r watching this and r not on his side #NoBillNoBreak
yes how dare he schedule votes?  What, does he think thats his JOB or something?
@GOP to protect their bosses, our day will come, we'll rewrite the Constitution and laws of injustice
@brandi_e_hudson @SpeakerRyan @USDOL are those the ones that fund the Clinton campaign?
If you were to tell the truth your face would fall off. Wait, that might be a good thing.
The GOP doesn't care about Americans living or dead as long as they get their money from lobbyists.
Because he's for Wall Street and shady people. #SpeakerRyanTryingToScrewLittleGuy
@SarahKSilverman OMG!~ Gun down, rape, pilfer, steal, deny civil rights - but must protect the terrorists!!
that's bull 
there is something very wrong with Mr.Ryan. At this point I am afraid to ask what it is.
He's done kissing the NRA's ring for the day, time to kiss Wall Street's ring
of course there next nominee does that
Sounds like he has something in common with HRC. Who's the financial director of her campaign again?
If Ryan gets his way to stop gun control, less will live to retirement age. #holdthefloor
typical Republicans would expect nothing less from them #NoBillNoBreak
damn them for doing their jobs and not molindlessly strip innocent people of their rights
Ryan doesn't have the middle class intrests at heart!
capital of Mammon
He's trying to distract people from his non-plan for healthcare and gun control by screwing over more people.
no link to the proposed text, no file number. I assume that's to make it harder to call you out on bullshit
let us vote. You guys represent the US. A government by the people for the people. 80% of us want gun control
Is beholden to big money, not American Lives
thanks for that info keepem coming! $$$$$ lol
@bjcrochet @SpeakerRyan @USDOL Strategy to divert attention from  demand for vote on gun regulations.
It's like all they care about is appeasing corporations not people.
