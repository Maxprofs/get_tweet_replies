the Koch bros are a cancer to America they own the GOP and there is no end in sight we have to pass legislation to control them
like Soros or Buffet? PHONYS
@WSJ : the KOCHS they are Public Enemy Number One

- American Crossroads,Ready for Hillary,Restore our Future,Priorities for http://America.Top  super pacs
you know an awful lot about losing don't you.
@WSJ Like the ones you say about Trump ? Or the ones you said about being an Indian to get a cushy 400K salary ?
@JaniceGW criminals
Why aren't you harping about the debates the pantsuit ducked out of? Why lie and endorse her now? #WhichWarren
-You're going after all the top donors not just Mr.Koch I hope.2 of those are Democratic super pacs
I could say the same about your support for abusing the law to shake down companies and restrict their free speech.
Oh. please......Multi billionaire Soros far out does Koch...who by the way hosted Chelsea Clinton's wedding.
HAVE HRC AND THE CLINTON FOUNDATION DO THE SAME HRC IS AN AVALANCHE OF LIES THAT YOU SUPPORT
#HEXIT>@SenWarren
please include the down spread of Trump in your tweets... We need you
I would also like to read the speeches hillary made to bankers in order to receive the millions of dollars paid to her
what the hell r u blabbing about, Elizabeth? The #KochCandidate is #FrackingHillary, your master. U r a #LapDog not attack dog.
George Soros is the Democrat financier. He also has several media outlets,think tanks&he is even invested in the voting process.
@WSJ
Did you ask George Soros this also?  #goofy
let's have Soros (who funds you & your causes) do the same thing, then.
@WSJ kind of like the lie of how your part Cherokee that you used to advance your career
Thank You for the truth.  http://Ucclove.org 
@firstlastsecond
It's time to tweak Donald some
@kardamylaxios @WSJ invite little weael #LyinRyan who just spoke at private fundraiser hosted by Kochs
@kardamylaxios Gather your thoughts sir we will wait.
@WSJ you first. where are @HillaryClinton 's transcripts?
So you're against #OpenDebates now? BTW, you lost credibility on the campaign $$$ issue when you endorsed #Hillary over #Bernie.
@WSJ They are funding the destruction of the middle class by crushing unions nationwide.
let’s talk about lying with your candidate @HillaryClinton
Your 15 minutes is up. You didn't get the VP nod. You suck, #fauxcahontas
you spelled Soros wrong.
Isn't he backing Hillary now??
@SenSchumer Difficult to believe this guy, hiding behind all his money and lawyers, is decrying the absence of open debate.
1 voter 1 vote. take the money out of politics. tax all pro DEM & GOP packs 99%. allow 0% deductions. free elections
calling out a Koch, ballsy...I like it!
@SenSchumer @WSJ Clinton's know about lying.
@SenSchumer How do you people sleep at night? Pathetic!
@SenSchumer how about y'all release Soros's spending to wreak literal havoc on the GOP for the DNC...
uhh, Soros?
@SenSchumer seriously.
@WSJ @realDonaldTrump
KOCH is not the problem @e3
I think both parties could use a little less slinging and a lot more cleaning.
attack dog? No, u r nothing but lap dog & lucky if #HRC comes to pet u, or maybe lets #PervBill give u a bone(r).

#JillNotHill
koch must have his stick in your brownie too @SenWarren the disgraced shameful liar fraud of a public servant #RiggedElection #JillStein
.@SenWarren @FoxNews HRC-reveal speeches to Wall Street for $$millions; Liz is afraid to ask, Bernie dumped, dishonest HRC still at it
how about the super pac money driving Dem candidate campaigns? "Be the change"
Why is @MMFlint allowed to produce his crapumentaries filled with audacious lies?  Why don't you threaten him, @SenWarren
Evidence? 

A person in your position shouldn't make such slanderous statements. 

Back it up, coward.

.
“They're all bought and paid for" our song is America's new National Anthem
yes, much like how others spent millions to lie about Hillary for decades and now the Bernie  people have bought into it!
Want to protect open debate? Get rid of the Commission and the 15% requirement
why is it you never post about issues concerning the commonwealth ? Massachusetts is your number one concern but hard to tell
It should be a Wonderful Life for all of us, Mr. Potter (Koch)
Dem supporters do it to. Lets stop pretending the Dems are morally superior to Repubs.
Where are you when George Soros does the same? Complete fraud and hypocrite. Go home Pocahantes.
@WSJ Pocahontas and false college application you should be talking
Will u support the same for Soros?
@WSJ 
Pocahontas...you are just upset the Koch brothers are not supporting your left wing agenda...phoney.
Just saw "Warren". Automatically rt. Am I a robot? :-D
KOCH BROS ARE TRAITORS LOOKING TO CONTROL AMERICA ,
@WSJ  Senator, I feel like people are over looking the obvious.  Donald TRUMP is America's HITLER.
EVERYONE, please remember that WSJ is OWNED by Rupert Murdoch, the man who gave us Roger Ailes.
we stopped using Angel Soft toilet paper because they own the company
Me too. Seems silly to boycott toilet paper, but they don't deserve to wipe my ass.
This link sucks. I was unable to access the article. Waste of time.
Liz - disclose how you took advantage of those that lost their homes to foreclosure and turned a tidy profit doing so. U r awful
Why are you supporting Hillary who gets soooo much money from Wall Street and rich donors. You are a hypocrite.
@WSJ Koch brothers paid for us to have the congressional mess of ineffectiveness we have now.
Although, Maddow did report on John Birch Society, maybe time to show Koch brothers ties, father & Wisconsin.

Keep at those two fools.
@WSJ lets protect open debate by having a DNC that is not biased towards the most unfavorable candidate in the party, COME ON
has he contributed to your funds or Hillary's?
@WSJ shut up
just doing what the left does, only not as well
isn't that the paper of dreaded Wall Street fat cats rigging our economy? (Also donating 100s of millions to your gal Hillary)
Want to protect open debate SenWarren? Insist and fight for 2 top 3rd party candidates to be included in debates
@WSJ you go girl!!! Thx 4 being on the common folks side!!! Kochs were born w silver spoon cant relate to the masses!!! Pathetic!
@WSJ Typical Elizabeth Warren. Trained at the knee of The Queen of Lies and her husband "I didn't have sex with that woman".
Want to resurrect openness and fairness? Focus on your own party and their donors. Deflecting this way is just typical politics.
I love that your our bulldog in the Senate... It's been a void for far too long. Keep up the fight for the voiceless
Speaking of open debate, can you ask HRC to #ReleaseTheTranscripts please?
@WSJ i have one question whos giving Hillary her founding?
will you demand the same from Soros?
I still don't understand why you would not endorse Bernie back in the midst of the primary season. What were you afraid of?
@WSJ Thank you, Senator. I hope everyone reads this.  Please continue to make a difference in American & the campaign.
Hear Hear
@WSJ Koch brothers doom and gloom propaganda of last +7 years has created @realDonaldTrump
coming from a shrew who endorses Hillary Clinton, this is laughable. Dems again shown 2 be the evil party.
Even the money he's given to Hillary?
@WSJ Behind mind manip hard core criminal org Clinton Inc._shut staffer Seth Rich before to testify on stolen elec.fr Bernie
@WSJ Keep big money out of politics
@WSJ Liz, I thought you got the memo that our Party no longer supports campaign disclosure or finance reform?
Spot on as always!
@WSJ funny if he did that he would ruin #HillaryRottenClinton 
So keep talking #bigmouth
Right. Like we all don't have brains to filter out the lies. They backed Romney, didn't get him anywhere tho
#LibertarianParty #JohnsonWeld2016  By protecting #BernieOrBust #VoteStein by a SERIOUS 3rd party choice
@WSJ great job Senator Warren, you represent us all so well
Like donations to Hillary.
please go back to baiting Trump
you have no soul, you sellout
At least try to make sense.
Fauxcahontas @SenWarren @WSJ
