HRC and her wall street minders OWN YOU. Look U were REJECTED for VP slot Won't call HRC on it because U chicken
#LyingDonald Don the Con
He's a broke ass chicken!
Do you have any ideal of how incompetent IRS auditors are ? All tax lawyers advise, Don't release under audit
can't stand in HRC's shadow when it comes to courage. He'd disappear!
I would be curious to even see the official letter from the IRS stating he's even under audit.
regardless, Nixon released his tax returns even though he was under audit himself
Donald is a con man. His supporters know this as well.
and ur 2 chken 2 call urself white.instead u "claim" 2 b native american..ur a fool 
W/blonde hair and blue eyes
Hey, AH, don't make a fool of yourself. Check out a book on genetics and ask someone to help u w/the big words.
We need Trump's tax returns which conceal criminal activity.
Tax returns are just the first step. Starts the journos digging.
how many flips did you buy when real estate crashed?
He's definitely trying to hide something.
like what..the #IRS would be all over him in a heartbeat if he is doing something wrong..
Not illegal to do business with foreign countries; however, problematic if you owe them as Pres.
the only way if we owe them would be by the current #POTUS we have now
@HillaryClinton Release your @GoldmanSachs Transcripts. #Tatiana #US
not standard and you know it. And she released her taxes. Where are his? Or any of his audit letters?
Trump's more like a Rooster. Besides,in debate w Hillary, he shared he been audited "for YEARS". NOT a good sign
yes liz they all do - but at different times which u should know, but u too enthused about disparaging comments
@bannerite @realDonaldTrump
Escaped Billions of dollars in taxes.Then went through 2 bankruptcies shortly afterThis ahole expects the rest to pay FOR HIM
is hiding his taxes because if we see his returns everyone will know how crooked he is.
.@CarrieRobinson6 @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Carrie he isn't hiding them! He deleted them, 30,000 times! U should b ok with that? Right?
I could care less, it's his connections with Russia and Putin and HIS lies I'm worried about.
ummm... ???? Ok???? Good luck! ???
With all terrible things hes said of "politicians" how does  ingrate think anyone in Washington would help him get anything done?
you are my hero for holding the feet of @realDonaldTrump to the fire. Keep it going!
Once again, show us the bleached bitten emails that would put clinton in prison.
Nasty Warren has gone quiet.... Hard to defend Crooked Hillary and the email scandal. Probably blame FBI instead of content. Pay to play....
Isn't that like you and Ms. Hillary calling the kettle black?
@reesworld1 @realDonaldTrump 
Not chicken. TOAST.
I'll give you this. You've got gall; you Indian princess. Yuk, yuk, yuk. 
NO BODY REALLY CARES!  HILLARY IS  SO CROOKED WITH ALL HER DEALINGS!   SAD SHE MUST KISS BILLS ASS 4 HER GAIN.
@larryfd @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump is a chicken! No doubt! Did you see him duck at podium like a scared baby rabbit? Sad!
@ElizabethForMA @realDonaldTrump probably has Kim Jong-Un or Vladimir Putin on the take, Senator.
@xdelmar59 @realDonaldTrump he has a lot to hide. And if he releases them, they should be certified. Easy to make fake returns.
@bannerite @realDonaldTrump   
Follow the debt and follow the money. https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3110611/Letter-Trump-Business.pdf â€¦

hey didn't you lie about being native American. Where's your credibility
i dont care about his taxes. Media will use against him because he takes advantage of congresses bad tax laws
Liz, personal put downs like that should b below the dignity of a senator. grow up.
People should not vote for him as he is not transparent & he is a Conman.He wants USA 2 default its deficit.Poor
Very mature, Senator.
senator, what the hell do you think will happen if hillary wins? She is head over heels for wall st. U r nuts
He's a con man playing three card monte with tourists in Times Square.
Shouldn't you be busy doing Senate work?
"There would be too many questions." Oddly, in Trump land, that's justification for not releasing them.
As your candidate has a major health issue in front of thousands.  Priorities #HillaryCollapses
lol who's talkin
@EricShapiro3 go get him, Elizabeth. Get under his skin with your finger nails!!
Oh you are GOOD @SenWarren - this lady knows exactly how to get his goat. Love it
Do you mean foul? He's hiding his wealth and being a Sociopath, he thinks he doesn't have to release anything.
I think he should hold on to them...just to drive all the libtards crazy. It's working so far!!
sen who proposes ssira bill should contact person who has a petition with 2,945 signatures jasonlhm@yahoo.com
- He's not falling for Twitter bait anymore....have you noticed? @bigmouthpol
nobody cares about tax returns we care about the safety of this country &jobs and Hillary can't do either for us
why aren't you pushing to see record's of Hillary's transcripts from Wallstreet &Goldman sakes stop being fake
What Is He Hiding? He's Just Too Chicken.
1,000% Agreed!!!!
@gooch_elizabeth @realDonaldTrump no one asked you
Say what? No one asked YOU! #Deplorable
@cnn @bbc Trump is hiding a while lot of info that can be used against him thats why he wont release. Fraudster
Like Hillary hid information from the FBI and Congress?  Or do you mean something else? No class at all. Sad.
Fauxcahontas is soooo brave. Why didn't Obama release his college transcripts?

You are a COWARD!!!
when you have things to hide, the chicken game is played.
Too chicken, and believes the rules apply to everyone but him!
This so true so what wrong with him
fauxcohontas, go back under your rock
anyone in gov't supporting hilLIARy is part of the corruption
agree ! Kikiri, piopio.
What do Presidential candidates tax returns prove?  Nobody pays attention to this or cares.  #fakeindian
He's too corrupt.
@realDonaldDrumpf #wallstreet #transcripts are irrelevant though?
what qualifications does he even have no public office no military just Brankrupcy not smart just knows how to cheat
Time is slipping away. Don't support a #PigInAPoke!
I'm not sure if Trump is being a chicken but I do agree that he should release them.
picking a fight with the Donald, he isn't obligated to release his taxes, but it is kind of a tradition.
You have to suspect he has paid no taxes and has given very little to charity.
every elected official should.
He's afraid we will know who he really is #RedDawnald
we need more surrogates like you to step up the game. Trumps Russia connections  could be of dire consequence to US security
can u please speak like a senator or at least an adult! chicken... What's next pick on his mother?
@brycehardimanwv @realDonaldTrump Every presidential candidate should release their emails. Oh wait, Hillary's are deleted 
But we're in for one exciting election - Polls are getting close. @ChaseSansom @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump
. @SenWarren Yes! 

Please put that up on a billboard outside his NY airport so he has to see it even damn day!!!
Trump is a Huge Coward..It's a well known fact that Trump is  a coward #NEverTrump #p2
Damn it, what happened to all my #ChickenTrump memes??
that's the real face of Donald trump cheating and hiding
We need a federal election law that sets a minimum standard for disclosure of tax records, health records for party nominees.
good one..he is chicken. That will work! Delete your account minion.
When are you going to hit the campaign trail?  WE NEED YOU!!!  Desperately!!!
release Tax returns
It is past time for trump to release his tax returns. What is he hiding ???
goofy
All sensible American voters feel Trump tax returns should be disclosed. Thanks for pressing the matter.
IT'S NOT REQUIRED! I WOULDN'T DO IT EITHER!!
Trump will release his tax returns when that felon #CrookedHillary turns herself in for obstruction of justice.
or much much worse!
Trump dont want Americans 2 C his shady deals & how he does so much business with rogue nations.not trustworthy
Boasted he could shoot someone in Times Sq. & not lose a vote. But taxes - might cost him election.
@NCfarmer321 @realDonaldTrump reporters don't say that SUCK TODD said "he doesn't want the scrutiny" WRF? Isn't that the point?AH
@JoughSi @realDonaldTrump politicians shouldn't lie about being an American Indian, but that didn't stop you. Disgusting
Chicken Shit is a better way of wording it. IMHO
Sen warren calling it like it is. Chicken Trump.
He knows it would be all over! Can we rush a bill requiring presidential candidates to release tax returns?
@andrewgbubemi @realDonaldTrump You tell him, Sen Warren ! 
That's an insult to chickens everywhere.
see this is all u dems have to talk about, I wouldn't release them either, that's all u have on him....go djt
The Press is letting HIM off!!!!
@JimArmstronger @realDonaldTrump listen to the ambassador of the middle class... $300+ grand to teach one class. Help MA!!
not worse than what she said about americans
Russian gangsters won't accept 10 cent on a dollar, like American sub contractors did, gold or lead
you would be chicken to if u owed Russian gangsters $650 million and needed to get elected to repay the debt
the Eric may as well said daddy was crooked today doesn't want public deplorable to look at taxes
Donald Trump coward king of corruption a disaster as an American and a human being
is ask you if you're 12 years old but your pic suggests otherwise
.@SenWarren .@stephenmatlock .@realDonaldTrump Trump voters don't care.#TrueBelievers.

@BillyT_202 @realDonaldTrump

but @HillaryClinton is untrustworthy?I don't get it.He's a bigoted,racist,fear mongering liar. #nationaldisgrace

Donald is taking his chance. He's a gambler.
and paid speeches!! @HillaryClinton #BringBackBernie
he's a con artist and a liar. I dare him to be honest with his Klan, see how much they like him then.
the #DeplorablesParty is not a major party.
said on OZ wouldn't release med report if bad.  Same must be true on tax release. #trumpCONolitics@Lawrence
@Deemoney521 @realDonaldTrump Maybe he could find a reality show to release them on, like the Real Housewives of New York.
Drag him, Senator! @AnneRiceAuthor @realDonaldTrump
Theyll divulge he's not as Rich, invests offshore, Russian tried, he's cheap/doesn't donate to charities! @realDonaldTrump
Now clear #DonaldTrump forged 1st MD letter onto old letterhead.  And no lab dates on new one. Chicken & fraud!

How about a cowardly Chicken
It's not if he's hiding something it's how much. Deplorable Donnie thinks rules aren't for him.
he can't get it up,bust a chub,pop a boner,get a stiffieLOL!It's why he won't release his Med records fear wuss
not too chicken ... he's too dishonest
I want to see Hillary's wallstreet speeches release those.
That's the pot calling the kettle black.
And then there's Haiti.
Bring Back Bernie 
+ be on the side of right
@CNBC really spun your time on-air today as nearly pro-Trump, over and over again, despite ' the wrong direction' comment..Bias
Because he know he will not recover from what they will reveal:  income, donations, parternships
@Zoraida12098036 @realDonaldTrump He thinks he's above the law
What's this, a schoolyard challenge? Why didn't you support #BernieSanders, Liz? That's what a grown up would do
What about the Clintons releasing financial statements on the on the fake Clinton Foundation?
In Mexico he's a new menu item El Orange Pollo loco #NeverTrump #DonTheCon
Is there a Republican agenda against non-Christians in this country? Do Republicans understand the purpose of the Constitution?
Deplorable Donald is a con artist. Sad!
....he sure is!!!!! Brooooockbockbock....release those taxes DJT!!!! WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE???......
he's arrogant, thinks it's nobody's business what's in the returns, skeletons!!!
the CONald is a COWARD.
IF TRUMP CAN DIOBEY THE RULES OF THE GAME...WHY WILL ANY OF US SHOULD? RELEASE THE DAMN TAX RETURNS DONALD TRUMP
Baiting Trump with a tweet this lame will no longer work.
it's because he's not nearly as rich as he pretends.
Only Donald Trump has the nerve to violate the rules of election....NOT QUALIFIED FOR ANY ELECTED OFFICE!!!
Sen Warren tweets and the racist dinner bell is rung #basketofDeplorables
Gee, now don't start a fight with him!
@AmyLBanamy @realDonaldTrump Disgualify him Elizabeth WTF don't understand it 
Trump = no transparency.  What is he hiding ?
@bagglo @realDonaldTrump #Trump is not a Chicken. He's an Ox. If it's necessary Trump will show u everything. He's a smart dealer
@BarbaraHershey8 @realDonaldTrump that is very true he is
How will government prevent conflicts of interest w/Trump's business partners if he's elected? It's time to be proactive!!
A Chicken" w/no egg$ in his coup. LIke his Mexico trip, he showed NO huevos. Probably pays no taxes & no charity
no it would require a greater work of fiction than his last tax return and his script writer can't wing it 4 him
They should also release the transcripts of the Wall St speaking engagements
every progressive senator should support candidates who oppose Wall Street crimes. They all do except chicken @SenWarren
Amen!  He's a con man too!
Nobody gives a hoot..Do something constructive and pass legislation. Until then he's not required to show taxes.
When you call him chicken and i see the post on twitter just below your tweet.
Should happen before they get security clearances????  Someone should know if there are foreign interests??
Please give us your verified heritage.  When you come clean then you can throw stones at others.
@JimArmstronger Keep On Him Senator Warren! Don't Let Up!!!
Agreed, but let's add to it anyone running for a federal office or appointed to lead a federal agency.
