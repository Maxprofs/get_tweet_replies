@spooney35 @WellsFargo @SenateBanking You were FAB!
See, ANYONE BUT HRC better watch out for loopy liz.
H @HillaryClinton is sucking on Dicks at @UN #UNGA
@VisualizeChange @WellsFargo @SenateBanking
this is incredible, encompassed what every customer has ever felt their politician should do.

you are a hero of mine!!!
nope.so far, so good!
hero?  you have low standards considering she did this..
@YouTube it was the BEST! Thank You for standing up!
I'm starting to think that you're a Narcissist; promoting yourself and what you're doing. Sad 
Gutless?  That describes Warren's decision to stiff Bernie and progressive movement.
and u fortubately. Ur gutless folleagues who are complicit @WellsFargo @SenateBanking @YouTube
@YouTube what a brutal tongue lashing. Great job.
 excellent!!!!
Thanks for asking the hard questions @SenWarren. #accountability
Thank You Sen Warren
You are the best leader ever. I wish you would run for president.
Bravo on the rhetoric but we need more. Jail them &/or fine them a billion!
@HardRockinGirl @WellsFargo @SenateBanking 
Now she's grandstanding. What he did was wrong but don't gloat  Be a professional
Thank you, Senator Warren, for holding big banks and their unscrupulous practices accountable.
Except for HRC.
THANK YOU for being strong enough to take on @WellsFargo CEO. THANK YOU for being an amazing #rolemodel for women everywhere.
Pretty funny. He's being fiduciary. Anyone can question. Congress is gutless, a.k.a. on the take.
BRAVO @SenWarren !!  WHEN IS THIS GUY BEING TRIED FOR FRAUD?
This makes up for when you STOLE a minority college slot by claiming to be Native American?
@YouTube OMG John Stumpf gets fucking REKT
It gets harder to tell Warren from Trump every day with her crass speech. What next? He's a big pussy?
I think miss warren has got some hot sauce in her bag. Put it on em girl! Make em squirm!
. Wow! Way to go!!! You are right, this is of high public interest & they need to be held accountable!
meh ur verbal rants seem pointless since u endorsed Wall Street  Hillary @WellsFargo @SenateBanking @YouTube
if anyone knows gutless..its Mrs. Captain John Smith
@YouTube I love u...thank u for all u do
@YouTube What do we do to push BIG Banks & CEO accountability for theft perpitrated. Signed robbed
Fantastic questioning 
@SenWarren
@YouTube Warren and Wells Fargo support the same candidate for president. Derp.
@YouTube Waiting for you to confront fellow Dems in the same way 
@Grape_JM getting a little political here, but worth a look since Wells Fargo is so big in Philly
"Gutless leadership"? Like waiting to see who wins, then endorsing the corrupt corporatist? Hypocrite!
@YouTube 2 bad you only talk the talk when it came down to sticking with progressives youre with her
If 2-large 2-fail& #PoliceBrutality R Not Held #Accountable, WERE GOING 2 HAVE A #CivilWarII IN #USA.
@YouTube pffft, please. You want to improve humanity? Do make than spout hot air
great job.
@YouTube well done Senator Warren. Enough of looking the other way. Prison for mr. stumpf.
sellout
slay 
Amen.
Where were you when @BernieSanders and we needed u
HRC doesnt care about bringing any justice on this
his gutless leadership?Don't you support Clinton?Haha this is comical, how can you be taken seriously
Call me when actual action is taken against these crooks @WellsFargo @SenateBanking
I have watched it and you were kind in your assessment of this sociopath.
What about the trillions of $$$ you and your follow Senators have wasted?
Senator Warren, I appreciate your actions yesterday , but good grief, you received enough praise  in the NYT.
You have always talked a good talk but the walk is something altogether different #NeverHillary
where was this tenacity in standing up to @HillaryClinton for being in pockets of the banks you regulate? @SenateBanking
you might as well have just copied Hillary and said "Cut it out"
speaking of gutless leadership remember when you didn't have courage to fight when it mattered in the primary?
Bernie could have won MA. You talk, but no action toward progressive gov't for change.
@YouTube 100,000,000 HRC, KNOWN wealth. Female Boss Tweed. Sells uranium to Russia. We next Venezuela
Love you Senator! Jail for execs NOW! Cuffed on the spot. Not too late to round up the 2008 criminals!
You are awesome - that is all.
Have you seen this, @TaylorPutz? Your lady is in boss mode here.
~ you rock @WellsFargo ~ you suck @SenateBanking
\ she is outraged by this but is in bed with  Hillary, and didnt get angry about the irs or the va
You are gutless.  In the pocket of HRC???? you know as well as I do she is guilty and yet you back her
From now on whenever a banker pretends they don't know they are stealing we should call it "Strumph'd". Coined it.
@YourBarrioFL @WellsFargo @SenateBanking @YouTube I loved it!!! 
guy must be on drugs to stay calm and  calmly say surprised. Any human who really cared would be beside themselves
@YouTube just political posturing or will there be real accountability?
time for criminal prosecution. It's fraud! Make example of #WellsFargo,  the rest will fall into line
You kicked ass! How do Stumpf, wfc exec Tolstedt (w/$124 mil. payout), etc., sleep @ night? (Prob. on luxury sheets!)
We have seen countless stripping down there and here in UK; but nothing transpires; revolving door, Y
you are amazing
So proud of @SenWarren during the hearing today, the only one with a backbone, easy to see who the rest of them are working for
Your condemnation of those "Executives" who take advantage of Frontline workers was spot on! Sl√°inte !
@YouTube Madam, you are truly a force of nature, and I salute you.
@YouTube just watched it, @SenWarren, and you are a BAD-ASS!! THAT'S what we pay politicians to do!! Protect us!!
Thank You 4 your hard work !! Keep up the good fight- we need you!! #good vs evil
you acted like you were his boss.  LOL!  He only reports to the board you fool
Girl you are good. Thanks for all your hard work.
STANDING OVATION
focus your time on Trump's con jobs. It also benefit us all
Honest question. Will anyone actually make any of this happen? Agree with you, but will anyone go to jail? Pay back $? Sad...
.     please do not let them get away with this. They are thieves and liars!
. ... Stumpf rhymes with Drumpf.  #MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain #AmericanExceptionalism #LOL
Little people everywhere thank you for publicly calling out that slimy thug. It was exquisite!
this video should be mandatory in all HS government classes and every law school in the USA. Thank you @SenWarren
@YouTube Bravo MAKE THEM PAY We R so sick of this shit! The pitchforks R coming #wellsfargoScandal
@YouTube you Nailed it...you are the one who can make America great again..  Thumbs Up...
@YouTube #yougogirl
. @SenWarren thank you, @WellsFargo @SenateBanking Criminal prosecution of CEO Stumpf. Jail time. Claw back.
What have you said to her? Why is she above the law? You support her. You should know.  @WellsFargo @SenateBanking
. @SenWarren @politicques @WellsFargo @SenateBanking The Global Impact You've Had on Personal Finances...does D.C. even have any authority?
I know it terrifies the elite to put one of their own in Jail.. but it's past time.
@YouTube stop patting yourself on the back.  You lied on your job app
I love you for this Elizabeth Warren. I'm one of the people affected by cross selling. I will never get $$ back
Thank you for exposing the malfeasance and insincerity of @WellsFargo execs

I hope the Justice Dept & SEC go after them
This woman is an inspiration and really does her homework ! 
Fantastic!
@YouTube if u have a account take your $ to a local bank or credit union.
@YouTube thank you Sen Warren. Calling these crooks out. Your doing your job.
I love the work you do. But post something up beat for once or maybe just a picture of a puppy.
MAGNIFICENTY DONE I KNOW OF SEVERAL OTHER COMPANIES THAT HAS DONE SIMILAR ACTIVITIES
Re Wells Fargo: Thank you for being a voice for the people today
paid Bill Clinton 200k for a speech in 2011 @HillaryClinton was sos will  ask her to release it
Speaking of gutless, how do you give the Clinton Crime Family a pass so easily?
#CommerceWithoutMorality
Thank YOU Sen Warren for all that you do!! CEO and other execs should go to jail for this scam!
@YouTube 
Why isn't this woman running for President?
Amazing interrogation! We need more Elizabeth Warrens in our govt! What's the next step for him? @SenWarren @WellsFargo @SenateBanking
@YouTube Bravo Senator!
As a Veteran I want to thank you for giving me hope in political figures. We need more like you. Cheers to you
Great work LIZ!
not a good look for @senwarren as she asks what he has done and doesn't allow a for a response.
Absolutely a brilliant effort Elizabeth. As an "oldie" in NZ I swear I felt the Earth move. Magic !
Proud to see my favorite Senator skewer the malignant CEO at Wells Fargo
@YouTube - Hillary likes to give paid speeches to them.
thanks for holding them accountable
and this comes from an ethically challenged politician who claims she's an Indian and made money flipping foreclosures. #WOW
hmm lizzie
Do you feel proud about lying about being native American in order to get a job?
And what will you do about it @SenWarren? Nothing as usual. Lots of words & no action. Try walking the walk.
Have you returned one nickel of the $ you earned at Harvard, which u lied to get?
of all pple 2 accuse someone of fraud.#Fauxcahontas shouldn't you return salary from Native Amer lie?
You sound like a raging hormone hurricane. You are out of control!!
ya you sure were on the war path huh?  You are also a liar like crooked Hillary!
Get 'em, @SenWarren!  (Also, "Stumpf" sounds like the name of a villain in a Dickens novel. Apt, methinks.) | @WellsFargo @SenateBanking
Thank you, Senator Warren!!  Please NEVER stop speaking truth to power!!
The swish of the lovely word "eviscerate" is being heard a lot here.
Wells Fargo CEO should of pleaded the 5th just like Hillary's cronies did #CrookedHillary #LyingAboutLying #HillarysEmails

That was the most intensive truthful articulate poignant relevant questioning I have ever seen: 
A+++
Great Job Senator Warren!
Thank you for reminding us how are representatives are supposed to behave.
that was fun but you're all talk. Good for you but what difference did your little speech make?
Senator, that was absolutely beyond brilliant.  Thank you.
Hey Elizabeth Warren ..
 Talk to me when you don't support the candidate who takes the most money from big banks.
"Now let's get behind Hillary so we can bail them out" Illusion of opposition http://www.forbes.com/sites/traceygreenstein/2011/09/20/the-feds-16-trillion-bailouts-under-reported ‚Ä¶ @WellsFargo @SenateBanking
.@SenWarren @WellsFargo @SenateBanking Amazing, vital and true. Thank you @SenWarren for personifying LEADERSHIP. 
Grad standing on cap hill while vets die! How many people have been held accountable for killing our vets Pocahontas?!
Great leadership by you Senator Warren.
please tell me you'll run for POTUS someday! @SenWarren
is he going to jail?
you rock!
You are AMAZING!!! We need more like you in office!!!
Why didn't you run for President? So grateful you are a Sen but frustrated I can't vote for you. 1st time I won't vote for a Pres
You rock, Take no prisoners! @WellsFargo @SenateBanking
you might want to go after this too...
. Thank you for your work. Be safe. We need senators like you.
Thank-you for this @SenWarren. Thanks for holding @WellsFargo and Stumpf's feet to the fire. Keep up the good work.
thank you for working so hard for US with Wells Fargo Bank today !
Your the best !
Fantastic job today!
WF leaders culpable but couldn't get past your righteous indignation & sanctimonious attitude.
lets apply the same standard of responsibility to our federal employees, for example IRS commissioner
@YouTube please do investigate and prosecute these greedy corporate executives at Wells Fargo.
So much integrity, at this point @SenWarren thank you, this is about Congress. You did madam.
To bad U can`t B as passionate @ HRC Clinton Foundation & her corruption while she was SOS.U Hipocrite
Thank you, Senator. You're a truly great American.
thank you for voicing what all Americans feel.  @WellsFargo @SenateBanking
YOU...ma'am, are just as much a bloodsucker.  FATCA = scam, selling lies to Americans about fake tax$.
Problem will go way beyond bogus accounts & fees-Wells Fargo trying to hide extent of the fraud.
Goofy "Native American" Elizabeth Warren..good job grilling him . He probably was a Clinton donor 
you asked him to resign; will you be resigning for lying about you heritage?
@YouTube it was lame @HillaryClinton is corrupt and Wallstreet friend
...Ouch!!! Like a hot knife through butter.  Be accountable and resign John Stumpf!
you are my hero!
@YouTube did you notice the other senators seemed more afraid of him than he was of them?
I think you should call on the branch staff to tell their side. Pressure caused this 100%!
REAL laws need to stop this from happening again. Jail criminals on top who approve this.
I think thats exactly what 
Warren wants.
@YouTube the compliance officer was bought off to keep quiet.
@YouTube he is complacent and is covering up the full extent of the scam.  Keep digging.
Thank you Senator Warren for standing up for ECONOMIC FREEDOM for ALL Americans.
Bravo Senator Warren!
I bet the GOP & their corporate bosses chuckled when they made sure you wouldn't head that agency.
U are a Goddess Incarnate! I loved how u handled him,and hope the other Senators learn from your example. Come b our Sen in CA.
watched it. girl crush intensified. 

.  Mr Stumpf has not displayed an iota of leadership during this hearing. #sad
You, Senator Warren, are AWESOME!  Keep up the great work.
@YouTube you should be ashamed EW.
you should be ashamed, glad your happy about this,but there's @HillaryClinton she's a girl scout ?
you should grill @HillaryClinton over email @ClintonFdn and other lies and law breaks
#Narcissist
So U want justice from this corruption but not the murders lies and rapes of the Clinton's?
@YouTube you go girl, kick some butt today!  #myheroes
@YouTube remind me not to tick you off E.W. ....LOL
