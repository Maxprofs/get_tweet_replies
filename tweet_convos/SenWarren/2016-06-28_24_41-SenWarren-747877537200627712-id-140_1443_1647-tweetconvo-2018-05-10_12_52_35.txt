@interpretingall @PPFA And lets NOT forget that the GOP has a confederate Flag requirement in the Zika bill..for real...just 'coz
And the mosquitoes get tiny little assault rifles.  God I hate this GOP Congress!
Women can pay for their own medicine to have sex. Less than $20.00 at Walmart stooge.
Crocodile tears. #Hillary's Campaign Advisor is Jerry Crawford of most evil corp #Monsanto #Roundup
good point she might be frm ISIS ask for BC and built a wall around her house and make her pay it
Why dont they pay for their abortions. Planned Parenthood should do them free since they sell the body parts.
@AugustLady241 @PPFA Says so much about the Pro-Life movemt. Hypocrites all
why don't we go after Oxitec, the biotech co who released in Brazil genetically modified mosquitos carrying it
should have gotten the Billions Obama gave to Iran so they can Nuke us. Ask that question
@SenWarren @PPFA
when is this madness going to stop!
@HillaryClinton I DEMAND you OUT from the race for #Benghazi! Benghazi is Disqualifying you to Run for Any office. #TatianaWright
Well there you have it @twright55 has DEMANDED it. IT WILL BE SO!
The GOP in Congress are the most shameful collection of assholes in America. They need to be voted out. #PlannedParenthood
I thought that Obamacare took care of birth ccontrol. Why does Zika bill need to contain $$ for duplicate services?
So Planned Parenthood, the racist organization it is is the only place for women to get birth control? Don't tell phamacies
And also abortions for poor pregnant *insert race here*__________ women.....stop practicing eugenics Democrats!!!
Use the $$ given Planned Parenthood to KILL unborn babies & use 4 birth control~murder should not be considered 'birth control"
But how else will they punish women for having sex?
@rinkydnk2 @PPFA - No one with a brain has any respect for you anymore. Go grovel to your queen.
RT@food_democracy Breaking #Monsanto, Whole Foods & Corrupt Corp Organic try 2 kill GMO labeling http://bit.ly/291CG0N 
Keeping their panties pulled up would do the same and cost nothing... 19 TRILLION in debt and counting!
unfortunately your candidates HC platform doesn't cover this ideas. Bernie's does.
Give back the money they donated to you. @SenWarren @PPFA
how can we stop these vile creeps??
shouldn't the y just be aborted/
MISSOR MRS WARREN DO YOU REALLY THINK THE REPUBLICAN PARTY REALLY CARE I DON'T THINK SO
- Zika is patented and owned by Rockefalla   Your a useless piece.  When you get a chance say something with substance.
Back to the woman thing again.  Boy are you a Feminazi?
Why am I not surprised?  Leave it to the GOP to make a tragic situation for a woman worse.
Shame on them! Can't wait to see how fast bill passes when one of their own is born deformed. @SenWarren @SOUTHERNjamespb @PPFA
@jtkirklin @PPFA>If the @SenateMajLdr put a clean bill through it would have 100% vote & he knows it. CDC &NIH need funds now.
Thank you, Sen. Warren. @PPFA
How these poor women get off their back & maybe get a job & quit procreating like roaches. Not many mosquitos in workplace
hey, liz, or i mean "how"  you want my money to murder babies again? Injun giver
@GiGicmka @PPFA and they will not want to provide $ for services for the potential special needs of children #iamwithherandher
the #GOP is a hate group
@charliegus2 @PPFA Thank you for standing up for what's right (again)!
just what we need! Centralized government providing citizen's birth control! That's the role of government nowadays.
@Bettyjwo @PPFA Shameful
#fearSales ! Get ya #fearSales here!
@PinkIguana11 @PPFA they are terrorists in their own way.
I'm glad you are standing up for women's rights
Deformed? Is that really how you want to refer to possibility of disability? Lets not let this open a new eugenics movement
Ignore some of the dumb comments to this post.  GOP cares nothing about women's health.
Fake Indian.
Those "deformed" babies have perfect hearts, and are perfect examples of Jesus' love. You wouldn't understand .
because bill is loaded with a bunch of other crap, thanks to misleading democrats
@yodaquoter @PPFA Pathetic. They'd rather have a child born that requires thousands of dollar in care. #GOPshortsighted
Coming from someone staunchly pro-choice, I can't take you seriously.
all of #America should take action and revolt against forcing women with #zika to remain pregnant. Women should have rights
I support your position but saying that atypically developed infants are "deformed babies" is an offensive choice of words.
Efforts must be made to fight Zika but physical disabled people, including infants, are not deformed. Thank you for your time.
@HappyChichester @PPFA I honestly believe these "riders" undermine the republic & are tantamount to treason. Harsh? Nope.
because people with disabilities and limitations don't deserve to live? Hope my autistic child never has to listen to you.
@SenWarren @PPFA
@rcarr57 @PPFA The GOP only cares ab controlling the money in US and nothing ab its people.
@rcarr57 @PPFA Shameful!!!!!!!
And #GOP claims to be the family values party. All they value is harming women and children.
why do you hate our unborn babies @PRyan aren't you supposed to be pro-life but I guess not healthy life? @livenewscloud
and what about the babies themselves? Is women all you think about?
@lucydog93 @PPFA ReTHUGlicans always intruding on others people's health & reproductive rights like the Taliban.
@Statistar30 @PPFA They're planning ahead, they need future GOP politicians.
Alinsky-speak not believable get real do job or r u un qualified to walk the Talk?  Get funding from Clinton foundation
Yes this will kill people, and the gop doesn't care, but onetime you said something you thought was true but couldn't prove
"avoid having deformed babies" is Liz Warrens euphemism for killing the baby in the womb. @HeimishCon
maybe if the deformed babies donate millions to Hillary she would give a shit
Now we're at the bottom of it. This is all about funding Planned Parenthood for you, not really about Zika.
Ironic that the work of @PPFA helps to stem the risk of Zika by preventing unplanned pregnancy. The GOP out of touch with reality
pass the bill so women will be protected from this virus.  If you don't pass the bill, blood is on your hands Sen. Warren
what should you care Warren, you're for planned parenthood and abortion and women's rights. You want to blame mosquitos?
How about you underhanded assholes add an amendment to the constitution stating plainly: 1 bill 1 law. #stopthegamesDC
This the worst news ever! Those poor women! I'm just so sick of Repubs!
Can we get rid of Republicans in Nov, please?
Maybe you should be giving free condoms so they don't get pregnant in the first place!
Normally I hate the idea of eugenics, but I'm on the fence on this one.
Maybe they would care if more White babies were infected.
Hey save money and just do what you so strongly pushed for...abort them!! He'll has a special place for you, Crack head
~ continue 2 empower & educate what's a stake whenever a bill is blocked by Dems & why not to believe the GOP propaganda!
As a Brit in the US, it confuses me why unpopular bills are allowed to be bundled w/ more popular bills to get them passed?

Birth control? Is that when the man drinks 6 beers and passes out? @SenWarren @CandaceTX @PPFA
See a psychiatrist.  This is really a stretch of fear mongering.  Bull.
Of course it does, GOP argue for less gov involvement unless it has to do with pregnancy, then they want move gov involved
The #Republican RW cares nothing about women, we are chattel to them, disrespected, and should be at home for our master
you're putting lots of effort in tweeting about the #Zika bill yet not one effort given to help Bernie during primary in MA.
if I was an American Indian can I get welfare in Massachusetts
@grlwhomarriedtv @PPFA so sad.
you are shameless POCOHANTAS  pandering to women! Go find some foreclosures to buy!!
Why does the @gop have to be so sneaky? Probably because not many Americans agree with their twisted world view!
And remember cutting family planning $ is stupid when zika is sexually transmitted
What about all the blocking Clinton delegates did in St. Louis? When we leave, this is why. #Bernie
@SenWarren @PPFA
And avoid abortion by using birth control!
Unbelievable disgusting of GOP. Unfortunately, it fits their normal profile - hurting the people, favoring the rich.
It is clear the @GOP is not interested in protecting women from Zika.
GOP hates the poor
can we just do something? Like just 1 thing? Maybe? Please? Anything? Like just one tiny thing, let's aim to do one tiny thing.
if you endorsed @BernieSanders from the start, we would have an easier time getting @PPFA funding in @WhiteHouse.
Brilliant!
Details matter. Thank you for sharing the subterfuge.
I love you keep pushing I hope and pray you VP
Makes no sense.  Why?
if you really cared you wouldn't be supporting the reckless immigration practices spreading this disease in the USA.
Actually the Democratic party wants
Immigration laws and the GOP don't..
Trump hires them=100% FACT
You're grossly misinformed. Fact is, the Democrats and Obama have been fighting the laws we ALREADY have!
Fact: Obama has deported more illegal immigrants than any other President ever...
Just Google.
You are old & crazy. Left wing nutjob
