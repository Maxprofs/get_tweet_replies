There is no break for victims families except there hearts
you are all #jackasses for trying to tie terror watch list to gun control
Democrats are the #1 gun salesman. Keep it up.
The more you push for more gun laws. The more firearms are sold.
@nickylibs @RepMcGovern @RepKClark @RepJoeKennedy @sethmoulton THANK YOU ALL
. Show me a law that a criminal or a terrorist will follow.
unfollow
Happy birthday, Senator. Thank you for standing up for what's right.

Continue to snap pics and vids! This is not being televised! @SenWarren @RepMcGovern @RepKClark @RepJoeKennedy @sethmoulton
need reform now anything I can do I will
These people should be arrested for holding our government hostage
this is the behavior of our leaders. Disgusting.
sell out. #NeverHillary
Proud of these fine civil rights fighters
Fascists, each of you. Due process cannot be suspended, for any reason
keep the floor shut for at least a year
A political stunt. The D's had the chance when they passed Obamacare.
do something more useful than the terrorist watch list ban, which would NOT have prevented #Pulse
maybe you could go get some other Senators and go be supportive sitters :)
stand strong
Your not taking anyones rights here you PMSing socialist.
so this is your idea of rule of law in America? Your parents must be proud
License/register/insure - just like cars - is that so hard?
I hope you all join the #CleanSport movement: tell @usatf, no drug cheats!
@SpeakerRyan cannot speak 4 all voters!  We have voted Demo candidates too! @RepMcGovern @RepKClark @RepJoeKennedy @sethmoulton
I'm sitting right here in solidarity.  I urge all of America to do the same.
don't you have someone's freedom rights to violate somewhere?
No, but really-- do you need some food??? #thankyou #pizza #NoBillNoBreak
How can supporters send food and drinks? What do you need?
Yeah!! and Porta-Potties!! or..Depends...
#holdthefloor
and yet continue to imagine that you can stop a radical after they become radical
#WeWillBeSilentNoMore #TurnOnTheCameras #NoBillNoBreak
@KatCapps Massachusetts - we get the job done.
will you be joining??
America is proud of everyone.  Wonder if we'll be addressing EW as Madam VP?
support Biafra freedom and free KANU whose life is at stake
you guys are much too chicken to call out the gaming industry and Hollywood for promoting gun violence
we are here with you! Ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines!
LIAR! Gun control would NOT have stopped Orlando you crook!
How much do you make as a psychic?
It already happened! Please tell me what gun control would have stopped Orlando so I can debunk you
No assault weapons to regular citizens would have, w/gun he would've had to reload, and could have been stopped. I own gun
Criminals don't follow the law. As a gun owner you should know the same shooting could be committed with pistols
I know there are a lot of stupid gun owners, I just had not met one, nice to meet you, now f*ck off!
Note 2 self: add @AlbaMarina2016 to list titled "People who spell fuck as f*ck, thinking it makes them appear classy"
she blocked me lol. Facts beat democrats every time
We are all with you!
