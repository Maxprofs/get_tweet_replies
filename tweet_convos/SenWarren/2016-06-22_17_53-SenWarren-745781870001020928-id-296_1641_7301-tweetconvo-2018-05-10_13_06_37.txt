Sorry but your sister was murdered by a person. #PeoplekillPeople not guns.

Is your friend a Native American?

: old but memorable footage.#Resist #MerylStreepForPresident #StopSessions. we need good honest leaders.
This is diversion WHILE Obama releases criminal frm Gitmo. Oh, that's right, I 4got! Liberals don't care when Muslims beat women!
@repjohnlewis so proud of all of you!! Democrats fighting for the will of the people! #NoBillNoBreak 
You just think it's the people's will. It's not.
Yes it is. If you are fine with terrorist killing Americans, cool. I am not.
You know what? If a terrorist starts shooting at me, I'm going to shoot at him. Not wait 5 hours for the police to show up.
Great to see you too, @SenWarren! Thanks4joining #sitin demanding a #gunviolence vote. #NoBillNoBreak #NoMoreSilence
@RepDuckworth @SenWarren

.@SenWarren @RepDuckworth Hey - behind Pocahontas - isn't Cummings under investigation for using confidential #IRS records? A felony?
you're a sellout. Endorsing a woman who embodies WallStreet!!! You're a joke. BTW are you a gun owner too???
@SenWarren @RepDuckworth
You are a "Cheap Trick"!
You ALL need to RESIGN. You took oath to UPHOLD the Constitution. You want more refugees = TERRORISTS! RESIGN!
Thank you for your leadership on this important issue!
@SenWarren @RepDuckworth
I respect Ms Duckworth 4 her service. But YOU, Pocahontas, should be ashamed 4 ur socialist power grab attempt.
Fauxahontas!
Pocahontas with her one friend ..how sad 
Look at John Lewis, he looks lost 
Photo-op with a handicap person!  Shameful Pocahontas
@SenWarren @RepDuckworth
Right on guys. KEEP YOUR HEAD UP HIGH.   GUN REGULATION IS IMPORTIANT.  GOP IS NOT. #VoteGopOut
you should stand with Bernie.  You blew it.  Disappointed in you.
sit-in gives voter a strong reason to avoid voting for any R in November. Great PR strategy that money cannot buy
This doesn't change the fact that they should be protesting unvetted Muslim refugees.
PROTEST FOR THE LIFE OF GOD'S PEOPLE!!

why does the shooter not represent all muslims but does represent all gun owners
are you looking to pass more laws that law enforcement can't enforce like the laws in place that they can't enforce
Thanks so much for your efforts! You're an inspiration. #NoBillNoBreak
thank you!!!!! Incredibly grateful to all of you and so proud to see this happening finally. #NoBillNoBreak

I have incredible respect for you, Senator, but please reconsider this motion.

Ban assault rifles and dump the racist list.
Thanks for your support!

Go put your arm around Bernie, but careful not to hit that knife you put in his back.
Keep sitting #StopTheStunt

Funny moment. History being made live!
