I know VP is important, but you could affect the next generation. Hope you might be newest member of #SCOTUS and make RBG proud.
@HaitiJustice @mikecapuano @RepRichardNeal @USRepKeating Thrilled at action, but concerned no fly list uses racial profiling.
Ethnic profiling. Concerns noted, but safety first.
And where was Hillary with her moral support? Having dinner with an NRA lobbyist?
Publicity stunt did not work Goofy!! Gun sales rise after stunt!! One might be yours??
Thank you for working for the American people! Don't stop!
look at it this way: Millions of tweeters&U only garner 2400 likesTime to re-evaluate?

The only Solidarity there is the Solidarity to sit around, not work, and take selfies.
In New Zealand right now. The world is watching and CHEERING! #finallysomesense
I am so proud of my MA representatives and everyone taking part of #NoBillNoBreak

@SenWarren @mikecapuano @RepRichardNeal @USRepKeating
any GOP there? #letfreedomring
We're with you. Keep fighting the good fight. #NoBillNoBreak
Getting down on the floor and having to get up is the most work you've done all year
more proof the DEMS have no idea the problem. It like doing away with cars so we can eliminate drunk drivers. Guns are objects.
Hey, Fauxahontas, how goes the pow-wow? #FakeIndian
Such a sad day for MA.
Grandstands in solidarity!!!!
When do you cut CSPAN so 'the people' can't watch? When you're wrong and you know it.
We love Liz. No Liz, no vote.

Its going to be a long night they are stubborn.
Shame on Ryan for turning off House cameras during sit-in! No assault weapons! #noGOP
sitting on the floor like fucking monkeys..lol.. #MAGA
You should know!
We the PEOPLE appreciate what your doing!!!!
thank you.
after you disarm the citizenry and pass on to eternity will one day the government feel more apt to barrel bomb your children?
This is government action! Enough with moments of silence and hoping things work out.
Americans thank you. How sad that you have to demand reps do THEIR JOBS and govern.
stay strong
Y'all are doing God's work. Y'all need some pizza delivered to keep going?
Don't give up guys!!! Thank you 
thank you for your leadership!  #EndGunViolence #NoBillNoBreak
