Thank you, Senator Warren!  So proud to have you as our Senator here in Massachusetts.  Your courage is inspiring.
so jealous! In Oklahoma we have Inhoff and Langford! Embarrassing!!
We are spoiled in Massachusetts.
great state, can't afford to live there! :)
Depends where...
it is a great state, but it's still expensive in the middle of nowhere. Not just boston
I understand.  Central and north not bad. Great values.
I love my area, Pioneer Valley/CT river/great arts community. But 90% my income to rent!
Vote no all you want. You, along with your so-called party, has no power.
we might surprise you Mr Bannon
thank you for voting #NOonMulvaney! The disability community can barely survive on SSDI at poverty level now, as it is!
Mad men fall. Women catch the people and lead the future. Ivet Putnam
Elizabeth you are a winner.
give it to them! You are a hero for every young woman in America. And some of us old ones too.
Your only reason for voting no is that they are Repubs.
just keep doing what you are good at wasting American tax dollars by stalling our new government
looks like all your ranting and raving has not paid off. How about you start doing some real work for the American people
GOOD GOING!
hurray.  Success

obstructionists..
Liz Warren is foot draging every nomination of PRESIDENT TRUMP. Don't complain when it's happens to you guy's
good luck! Unfortunately I don't have a lot of confidence in the other Dems!
you're like a broken record  shut UP, jeeeeeZUS
Have a nice Day, it must be fun playing at Democracy, when will we ever get it for real?
they were wrong trying to shut you up..now everyone who was involved with Russia will be exposed
You also need to oppose Pruitt.  Your grandchildren need clean water and fresh air, too.
Thank you Senator Warren for fighting for us, The People.
Pocahontas, can you explain to the people what CFPB consumer financial protection bureau is and how disgustingly corrupt it is 
lol you will lose. Get used to it
Thank you for standing up.

be careful speaking against Mulvaney. Apparently only the President gets to speak against Senators.
you vote no for anything @Trump does. #shutupLiz
you do nothing positive for Americans, you need to get out of politics.

You are too late!
When he does it will have nothing to do with your request, but everything to do with your bullying party.
Warren needs to go home and talk to her mirror.
Love your tenaciousness Elizabeth! (And persistence ;-)
.@SenWarren Thank you for continuing 2 fight the good fights and not bowing down 2 @SenateMajLdr bullying. He must not sleep as well as you!
like rats from a sinking ship, they will all want to escape before the indictments start coming.

PERSIST You are OUR hero!!!~
You go Girl!
maybe you can try to read a letter from Corretta Scott King, Pocahontas?
can we please impeach the whole cabinet for treason?
please support endangered species act. humans are not the only ones worth saving. act stands in way of powerful making more money
you ultimately have to be the most morally bankrupt individual in politics...2nd only to Pelosi! Please, sit and shutup..please!
You would vote NO on Jesus Christ if he was nominated you are just a bitter angry woman and you need to go
term limits...
Thank you for persisting!
must not realize that her party has lost 1000 seats across America. It can't have to do with their agenda. Hers will be next.
.

you are an obstructionist with no thought for the American people or our duly elected president; it's your leftist agenda only
mission accomplished on #puzder...thank you for ALL your hard work during all these hearings from a fellow #bknerd #shepersisted
I hope you think you are making a difference. You aren't. Dems don't have message for working Americans and 8 years to overcome

Impeach Trump!
give up,  unless you change you will never be president.  The silent majority has awoken and is here to stay
Partisan politics in full force.  You have no credibility with moderates
you guys will never win over any votes by putting the country at risk by not filling the cabinet
You gotta love strong woman!
