They changed the name from Global Warming to "climate change".  it's a bunch of nonsense.

Becka needs to just stay on his knees sucking Putins tiny finger while giving him a lick-around
Call for Warren to work with the people as she does y appreciate that you have a dedicated smart woman TY!
Come on Republicans! "Exxon Mobil dropped its public arguments denying climate change in 2007."
Because is cheaper & easier to go w/the phony flow. Same reason lawsuits settled out of court.
Republicans, think quality and rising to the challenge. US can not compete with cheap and easy.
Isn't handing out cash, free phones, paid utilities, etc. the cheap & easy way as opposed to helping poor w/a hand up?
@SenWarren @exxonmobil @MassAGO The article and this thread are about climate change deniers (republicans) and the oil industry
Granted but you're the one who stooped to GOP bashing. Just returned favor. And thread more about global warming hoax.
@SenWarren @exxonmobil @MassAGO GOP bashing? I've only provided more evidence to prove GOP climate change deniers are wrong.
About this? https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/ …
BECAUSE IT'S EASIER 2 OIL DRILL IN FROZEN CLIMATES LIKE NORTHERN RUSSIA WHEN THE ICE IS MELTED!
Why were they never asked why they wanted the appoinment? Corporate take over of US.
rich get richer and the poor still live on $1 a day. Time to distribute the oil money to those who need it.
Can I post how many repubs on T-REX Committe own EXXON stock...and profits generated from sanctions lifting
climate change is just about MORE government control over the population....CONTROL....CORUPT!
@Hopeful_America @exxonmobil @MassAGO @BostonGlobe thank you @SenWarren for your strength and leadership
Hope we are about to get some climate change realists in the White House. Con has gone on too long
Being oblivious and in abject denial if reality...must be a wussy EXXON pro-Putin anus licker
Living in denial of reality & truth:  the mental illness of wussy conservatism on full display
.
Please continue to fight for us (not you @exxonmobil--you've done enough already)
before you talk silly, perhaps you should check your 401k & see if you've any oil stocks in there..hahaha
thanks for your advice but I already make sure my investments & my ethics line up. You should try it.
And I thank you for your concern as well & trust me, my ethics are right in line with my profit seeking.
Good for you then.

Like many a climate change issue "warrior," Warren doesn't behave as if climate change is that big a deal.

Climate change is a fabricated lie. Just ask mother nature
