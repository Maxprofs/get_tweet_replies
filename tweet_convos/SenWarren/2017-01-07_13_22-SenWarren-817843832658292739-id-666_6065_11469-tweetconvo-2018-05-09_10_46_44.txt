now we know why they tried to shut down that office
Respectfully, I think you're confusing OCE and OGE. @SenWarren @OfficeGovEthics
To the best of my knowledge, no, because he hasn't released them or given them to OGE. @therapyworksBC @SenWarren @OfficeGovEthics
I thought the IRS had implicitly confirmed that, but I could be wrong. @therapyworksBC @SenWarren @OfficeGovEthics
Right; thus, "implicitly." @therapyworksBC @SenWarren @OfficeGovEthics
@lizsalandar @OfficeGovEthics so why can't @SenateDems do something about it. @SenateGOP are as dirty as the orange creep.
fantastic let's not have the hearings until that's done make sure of it please
obstruct obstruct obstruct
When House Protesters tried to disrupt certification of electoral college win they needed 1 senator.
I'd like to see Dems Start acting like this is not normal & step out of line. #TheResistance #Resist
I bet the @OfficeGovEthics is a little rusty having nothing to do the last 8 years.
hows the student loan thing coming?
Can you force these hearings to be postponed until the work is complete? Do u need people to call? Let us know.
@olerunkbitch @SenWarren @OfficeGovEthics It boggles my mind that we have to call them SO that they do there fuqing jobs!
and get so many signatures on petitions. It defies logic.
Why don't we do this with our new POTUS???
You're not exactly one who should be talking about ethics. @SenWarren @OfficeGovEthics
Trump team not interested in ethics more obvious each day
.@SenWarren @OfficeGovEthics We're doing everything we can, and we're relying on you to do everything you can!
Crying may help!!
STHU Lizzie! Your friend lost fair & square. Time to back our POTUS for the good of the country.
FIGHT IT SENATOR!!
@PrincessBravato @SenWarren @OfficeGovEthics 
I keep waiting and watching. NOONE is doing anything except tweeting
Hello? Is anybody listening? It's time 2 recruit fighters #2018
Do you really think we will make it to 2018? I'm not sure
You still don't get it. He's going to take us all down.
Only if you let him. He's a tool for the GOP/PUTIN he knows zero
we put up with Ovomit for 8 years. Now shut up and back R Potus. America first!
critical - we need to ensure that any conflicts are addressed
then don't let them happen! Just do your jobs.
Historically you'd filibuster and minority party could meaningfully object.

How do you feel about ending that?
that's why they tried to dismantle the ethics comm. #RATS
Listen up cupcake. You NEVER, EVER get to complain about #Ethics when you endorsed Hillary. The end. @OfficeGovEthics
Can Potus Place an Executive Order to deny them?
@SteveRattner @OfficeGovEthics  Will hearings start tomorrow? Are OGE evals in progress? Voters demand full Ethics, FBI reviews!
why aren't dems and limbs going to the people! Bully them the way they do us.his nominees should be BLOCKED!
how can we stop this?
@BoffleSpoffle More power to you! Hope the Dems have some tricks up their sleeves to put a spoke in Trump's wheel this week.
- Where was your concern when PP used taxpayers dollars for the DNC super pac?
How can we help you?  Should we call Mitch McConnell.
I love how you are helping @realDonaldTrump win again in 4 years. You just don't get why you  lost. #Pocahontas
how do we challenge or stop this? #veryworried
Historically, you'd filibuster.
Before the Dems nuked it to silence the minority party, that is...
Then shut the hearings down until OGE can do its job.
Yes, filibuster!
Oh, Dems nuked that in 2013 to silence minority party objections?

Well, sorry.
So? Their own problem they drag their asses. Anymore whining?
Can you please advise why no Senator stood up and signed at least one complaint for the challenge to the electoral college vote?
so what are the GOP and Dems doing about it? #notmypres #TrumpleThinSkin #resist
thank you
Should some things become codified process so they can't be flouted?
To add insult to injury, most of Trump's nominees are as unqualified as he is. Majority are just as ignorant too
Who should we call?
dems should not participate.  stand up for right...  unlike JComey
that all went out the window around the time Obama decided to write laws himself.  No respect
Your egregious conflict is trying to fight Wall Street, while simultaneously supporting Wall Street's own hag.
Thank all your DNC pals 4 these pass it to find out what's in it laws..
@TracyCh25475625 @OfficeGovEthics Why not apply to presidential candidates? #TrumpTaxReturns #TrumpInvestments #TrumpDebts
@vooda1 @OfficeGovEthics Call your Representatives.  Rise Up!
@RevJJackson @OfficeGovEthics Hold them to it!
the candidates must be vetted. We need confidence in our government.
Don't worry Liz, they will all make America great again!..but keep playing ur games n shaming ur party
why is this 'historically' and not LAW... #makeitmandatory We the PEOPLE demand it!

Take all the time needed. Follow procedures. No exceptions.
@Myke_Reid @OfficeGovEthics 

No tax returns-Trump. No disclosures from nominees. Trump against our Intel. Rs siding w/Putin.
@Myke_Reid @OfficeGovEthics 

I fear NO ONE can or will stop Trump & his cronies. Every standard has been ignored. 1/X
I think Senators have right to place a 'hold' on a nomination. Maybe they can slow the train.
Make it stick! Vet ALL nominees before confirmation hearings! NO EXCEPTIONS!
This crew thinks they can make up their own rules. Scary.
Is there any way to make this administration follow protocol?
seems like you could delay a vote on each Cabinet member that hasn't been vetted. #McConnell-It !
A must Now and always and in writing, certified.  We deserve it as citizens acrossour great country.
But we don't do that for the President. Sad.
I believe Righteous Mitch M. demanded this after Obama got elected.
@realDonaldTrump The swamp got drained straight in to the cabinet. Hold their slimy feet to the fire.#USSRUSA
@IDyllicDump @OfficeGovEthics No hearings until they comply! Period!
McConnell insisted that all Pres Obama's appointees were fully vetted before hearings. We must stand up!
How do we make them stop?
This should be done THIS time since so many appointees clearly have serious conflicts.
Thanks for the info, but we little folks  would like to hear what you are going to do about this?
@zuessgirasoleme @OfficeGovEthics Not in Trump's Republican Party
but nothing under @realDonaldTrump is happening the way it should. It's frightening.
especially needed with this particular cabinet
everything's different in the year of @realDonaldTrump. Maybe they were vetted by Putin? 
you are a puppet of a nazi collaberator. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqw2-TlaWMk … http://soquelbythecreek.blogspot.com/2011/10/everyone-knows-that-elizabeth-warren-is.html …
Please No vet no vote...please help us...#novetnovote
starting with the President Elect!
Not this administration. 
have you come clean about the money you took from Harvard because U said U were Indian
Why are they starting now? Is this so GOP can waste more taxpayer $$?
Historically?  That means nothing anymore.
The gloves are OFF! Fight to win! Fight dirtier than they do! FIGHT!
we visited @SenSchumer today. we need pressure like this on Dems nationwide. #notoneinch on dangerous Trump/GOP agenda. #Obstruct
,@SenSchumer-is there no way to slow the rush to confirm?  For many of us there are so many conflict & qualifications questions!
I mean, presidents aren't usually elected without having their conflicts of interest explored as well.
But then the conflicts were known. Unheard of to schedule hearings without full disclosure!
then hold them accountable.
@OfficeGovEthicsGOP @co_rapunzel4 #CIA #Veterans #Education #Law 2012: "I'm not a scientist." GOP 2016: "I'm not an ethicist."
who is making sure our laws and rules are followed? Trump is not king. PUSH BACK!!! No appt is confirmed.
Unhappily, "historically" is the operative word. We need to figure out how to deal with our new dystopian world.
None of Tramp's picks are ethical.
this new administration.
. @SenWarren @moderate2severe @OfficeGovEthics How can this b happening? Corrupt @MitchMcConell
This is the first time in my life I can't sleep because of the clear danger I see we are heading towards with
this injustice. This is our lives and they are playing fast & lose with our healthcare, education, safety...
treat GOP like they treat DEMS.... its the only way they learn. On the floor call them out everyday..
to the docs so dems will not have enough time to review before the hirings. What can we The people do to help...
are hiring postponed? This should be written into the rules. It's obvious they are all hiding info & holding on
what procedures are in place when noms haven't given the basic documents before hiring are they disqualified or
Well how would that work with the Guy from Exxon? Has he no clonflicts of interest? I don't get it.
@BethShepard @OfficeGovEthics so what are Dems doing to make sure this happens?
please do not move forward with confirmation hearings until all candidates are fully vetted! @OfficeGovEthics
other than delaying the inevitable for 30 hours, what can you do?
TRUMP WILL LEAVE IT TO THE LAST MINUTE THINKING HE CAN PUSH THOSE IDIOTS THROUGH! DRAIN THE SWAMP START W TRUMP
lol how can they everyone of his team has something they are hiding! Trump is going to destroy America!
it has become way to easy in everyday conversation to openly say i am no longer proud to be an American.
our country needs an INTERVENTION. Some how, some way, someone needs to step out and #saveourdemocracy
tell that to someone who has never held political office @realDonaldTrump
Supposedly Mcconnell stated no confirmations til ethics investigation finished this morning, don't trust him tho
screw history just do ur damn job
@ranman09 @OfficeGovEthics That's a little weaker then last tweet soon u will forget all about it TURNCOAT ur all in it together
yeah this is the equivalent to a shotgun wedding.
@finbarvano @OfficeGovEthics I passed ethics test when I won. My nominees passed ethics test because I  picked them. So honest.
don't show up until they have completed questionnaires and supplied all info
call aarch on Washington, demands delaying appointments, demand Russia hacking investigation.
what can we do to stop hearings?
not going to let this administrations collective corrupt government stop doing what the people have demanded!
.@SenWarren @OfficeGovEthics To be fair, historically the PEOTUS is never a Russian spy. #NoMandate #illegitimatePresident
We need to do away with OfficeGovEthics and you need to go too! Both are a waste of tax payers money! CRYBABY!!!
Where have you been? Maxine called out for your help, as Paul Ryan laughed at her. Where were you?
What are you doing about it besides tweeting?  Let's see some public outrage! Press conferences! Injunctions!
why are you tweeting this? Don't we pay you to interact with the responsible party to ensure protocol followed?
According to The McConnell Rule of 2009 the @OfficeGovEthics letter must be complete and submitted to committee on time!
DO NOT let the man who lost OUR vote by 2.5+ million get away with crookery. Stop him! Vote NO 2 all
This should not change!  Reschedule these confirmations!
@Eykis @OfficeGovEthics Historically the US hasn't inaugurated a Russian spy either.
@DemAwakening @OfficeGovEthics yes you're right. Now let's find those Conflicts, fix them and get to running the country.
Fight the good fight Senator
@rmasher2 @OfficeGovEthics senator warren
ASST.FEURER MCCONNEL STEADFAST ON NOT WAITING
WHAT WILL YOU DO???
true Sen Warren. but we're living in a dictatorship right now, democracy thrown out #theResistance
Incoming Admin setting a new low standard for $ Conflicts. Hard to hold DJT feet to the fire as he govs by Twitter @BateNSwitch
The real DJT master of the Bate N Smith. Trump college@BateNSwitch, Mexico to pay for wall@BateNSwitch, America first@BateNSwitch
what should we do as citizens to object to this?
@RaceForTheWH @OfficeGovEthics
@deray @OfficeGovEthics KEEP IT THAT WAY
the POTUS doesn't normally commit #treason or act like Hitler what's the plan 2 deal with that?
We haven't really checked to see if Trump committed Treason by plotting with Putin to get elected @OfficeGovEthics
@SusanMaylone @SenWarren @OfficeGovEthics 
You haven't??? 
Dems shouldn't vote to confirm ANY nominee who hasn't been cleared
senator, u are aware that NO laws OR regulations OR constitution apply to TRUMP and his gestapo
so @realDonaldTrump cab picks have NOT been vetted? @AP @BBCWorld @cnni @DerSPIEGEL @Le_Figaro @AlJazeera RT
People who agree should call Republican senators to demand ethics reviews are completed before hearings begin
Don't be fooled by claims of "politicization". The facts do not support it. Dems were held to same standard.
.@SenWarren @SenMarkey Please affirm that you intend to vote against any cabinet nominees that have not passed a background check.
Was Geithner's tax avoidance OK'd by the @OfficeGovEthics?
I don't think it's a coincidence that the choice has been made to go against that tradition this year.
@CornellWBrooks @OfficeGovEthics Fight Senator. GOP doesn't respond to civility. It's time to fight against impending fascism
Is this a racketeering enterprise that is being organized by Trump?
well,  is that being done? or is it they will continue to do nothing as in the past?
No cabinet confirmation hearings UNTIL all ethics paperwork is complete.  U.S. Capitol switchboard: 202-224-3121
@stylistkavin @OfficeGovEthics so can you refuse to have them? What are dems going to do about this dismantling of our system ?!
don't let them get away with it
As you may know, Trump's AG nominee Jeff Sessions omitted decades of records from the required filings for his confirmation hearing... 1/ 
@ClancyReports @OfficeGovEthics
Mitch McConnell to Reid in 2009: nominee "financial disclosures must be complete... prior 2hearing being scheduled." 
@NormEisen The McConnell Rule!
like owing back taxes? Hmm who was that?
this administration is setting up to be free of ethics
really getting tired of DJT and his minions breaking both historical and legal precedence!
historically? Thats hysterical. You just don't understand why the democrats lost. Same ol same ol is done.
@Betterw05759703 @OfficeGovEthics Certifying this group has no conflicts of interest could take years.
what about Trump's mountain of conflicts?
@chestnut_daniel @OfficeGovEthics   .   The why is it allowed to happen NOW!
and why are there 5 or 6 on the same day that Trump has DE idea to make 1st press conf in 300+days
What are you and the rest of the Dems going to do to fight it!? Fight loud and hard! The people DEMAND it!!!
@pahstock @OfficeGovEthics PLEASE MAKE SURE IT REMAINS THIS WAY!!!
Q: What's the rush? A: GOP resents full disclosure/democracy. +Still awaiting T's tax returns. USA, Putin-style.
Trump nominee Jeff Sessions was previously denied a Fed judgeship by RONALD REAGAN (reverred by Republicans) ...
@deray @OfficeGovEthics So #MakeDemocracyWork & do your part to halt these hearings!
You go! Hold their feet to the fire!
Trump should NEVER be sworn into office.  He's done so much damage before his full ascent.  #SellingAccess
I support this  lets make sure you do same w Democrats
https://twitter.com/senwarren/status/817843832658292739 …
@SenWarren @samswey @OfficeGovEthics
Confirmation hearings historically aren’t conducted until the @OfficeGovEthics certifies that each nominee has no unresolved conflicts.
#Trumps whole cabinet has conflicts but the #GOP since they r majority with their corrupted ways will push them through,that's it
We the AMERICANS hired Yu.Yu will be fired just what DEMOCRATS did to AMERICAN MIDDLE-CLASS.Part time sucks
When the Dems get back in power,  start making some of these customs damn LAWS! Tax returns, too.
it might be easier to find out who DOES NOT have a conflict 
@deray @OfficeGovEthics Trump and the @GOP have no ethics. Ever heard of The Seven Signs of Ethical Collapse by Marianne Jennings
GOP would find a way to stall, stop tweeting and start using Senate rules to force compliance.
@deray @OfficeGovEthics “public office is private graft.”
File a suit or do something! Don't just tell us why u r helpless. This is our democracy
this is a lie it goes on before,during, and after. We are on to you so shut up!
except if nominee is democrat
Now now Liz that was the old way. This way will Make Us Great Again! NOT!
@Patience_Miles @OfficeGovEthics   We can help. Check this out. We can help.
One small step in the right direction.
So how are they getting away with this BS?
And for good reason.
Then no exceptions.  What was done in the past and historically stands as the gold standard #theresistance
You think maybe a few (or a lot!) of Trump's picks wouldn't bear close examination?
please make the senate delay the hearings until all ethic concerns are put to rest even if it takes 4 years!
@HatticusFinch @OfficeGovEthics  Then that's the way the hearings should proceed! Why is he allowed to step all over everybody?
who controls the Senate? Not You.
We need you to be STEADFAST in your review of each nominee. We support you!  74 MILLION people are on your side.
"unpresidented"
@carolebobarrel @OfficeGovEthics : and Sen. Warren, as citizens we have no voice to object?
Unconscionable.
@mayatcontreras @OfficeGovEthics NO WONDER REPUBLICANS TRIED TO CAN THE ETHICS COMMITTEE IN A SECRET OVERNIGHT MEETING! SHAMEFUL
we're counting on you!
GOP is trying to ram these awful choices down our throats in effort to maintain the Trump constituency.
@longshipdriver @OfficeGovEthics Can you NOT hold them so soon? What can B done?
@rjcaliente @OfficeGovEthics Fight him. He is not qualified to be President. He is a bad man.
