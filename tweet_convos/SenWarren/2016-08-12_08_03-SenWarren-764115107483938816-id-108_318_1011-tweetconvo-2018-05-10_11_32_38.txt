We know Elizabeth; you & the Democratic Party support FASCISM! After all, you have a long history of it! @FoxNews
Facism: "authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing system of government" That's Trump, sorry.
You have no idea of your Party's history! Therefore, tht makes you the ignorant sheep! You trade your
Just because you watched a movie about Hillary Clinton doesn't make you an expert on a political party
My statements aren't from a movie! My FACTS are based on documented US History! It's all in the annual
don't allow any for-profit schools to get federal funding!  We need student loan debt forgiveness or retroactive reform
You pretend to be an Indian to scam teaching 1 course for $300,000
Lame trick

@usedgov
@FoxNews @CNN @gesafaris @USAneedsTRUMP Her Indian name is: She Who Bumps Into Shit!
I prefer 'Chief Spreading Bull'

@No_2_PC @SenWarren @usedgov @FoxNews @CNN @gesafaris @USAneedsTRUMP

My blood is boiling over the pathetic, dishonest & malicious #Zika funding bill that @SenateMajLdr McConnell & the GOP just tried to pass.
bout as lame as claiming Cherokee to get a job. #fauxcahontas
Did you quit that fake crooked rotten Hillary bitch who loves Satan?
Bill Clinton netted $1.6 million last year from a pair of for-profit education companies. Thoughts? #hypocrite
Do you really write your own tweets? Your vocabulary is weaker than my 4 yr old nephews. No. Really. 
Sounds as phony as you are.
So talk about buying votes. Pay for college. OMG Why would a man who is a miner want to pay taxes for someone's college?
@SenWarren @usedgov
@jimmy_tallboy @SenWarren @usedgov
Oh, they successfully did it two times! Heneger college today, something else tomorrow!
they read it in the TrumpU how to manual
.@SenWarren if you really believe in this education plan you and Crooked Hillary keep babbling about, why didn't you teach for free?
It must be frustrating to have EVERY one of your post responded to by 95% negative realities of your own problems, SAD
here is another lame trick, pretending to be an Indian to get a job at Harvard
and you lied about being a Indian to get job at ha are loser and your gay husband
brought to you by your Rat-publican users, &3 time loosers.  All related to WHITE BIGGOTRY
You would know all about lame tricks wouldn't you!
Wow Senator, you have a lot of trolls! You must be doing something right. Keep up the GREAT work!!!
Laureate Education paid Bill Clinton nearly $1.1 million in 2015, according to tax returns. You're thoughts? #hypocrite
you pretended to be a bogus Native American to get a job at Harvard
THE PUBLIC EDUCATION HAS FAILED.  IT MUST BE REPLACED.
VOTE TRUMP!
sounds like Harvard
.@SenWarren @usedgov "bogus nonprofit" is mostly a redundancy in terms
this school is operated by the Clinton Foundation what's up
keep up the fight strong woman I believe in you
You're not impressing anyone Elizabeth.. SELL_OUT
@PPact 

Interesting that "non-profit" Planned P'hood is using my tax dollars for political advocacy and you are silent. Why?
thanks for ur detailed dissection of the filthy character called Trump
they learned their tricks from how the our government works. Congress needs to set the example please
meanwhile ignore Clinton Foundation tricks,you're so dishonest and goofy
like the one bill clinton works for. Hipocrit
no different  than Clinton pushing for profit schools  & making 16M. Talk about him too.
that is worst then Donald Trump has done well it is the same
but the #ClintonFdn is OK????? Selective outrage here! Ashamed!
Another reason the IRS must be well funded & allowed to do its job-with sample oversight audits
just like the lane trick you pulled to get into Ivy League schools
:Yes. Every parent should ask"What %of my child's tuition goes to the athletic Dept" when your kid isn't in sports.
Investigate every "college" of this or that out there. They all exist on govt $$$, cheating students. #ImWithHer
were they claiming to be American Indian???
Is Harvard non profit? Heck, none of them are non profit anymore. Endowment profits should be taxed.
I might actually consider moving to #massachussetts just to be your constituent. #loveyou, sister.
Hey @SenWarren how does a so called charity ( Clinton Foundation) keep 90% of the money raised for themselves & donate only 10% to charity?
Was it Trump U? Glad whoever did it was caught
Why don't you speak out against Laureate University and the $16 mil they gave Bill Clinton? Too close to home? #Demexit
- kinds like the Clinton Foundation "helping " Haiti.
worry about your own 400K speaking job
What rules would they be skirting? Aren't the rules for nonprofit schools more vigorous?
Been done 4 years. Mills Collages so of you colleagues went to them. ABC University in Guadalajara.
lame trick ! - just like u saying u are part Native American!
yeah BUT do they give AMERICAN NATIVES priority like you got Chief Warren @The_Trump_Train
please don't say "lame" on Twitter!!! It's Trumpian and its beneath you!
know what else is a lame trick-you not addressing Bill Clinton & Laureate 4 profit=16.5 million in #DirtyMoney 4 Clintons #Unfit
kinda like pretending to be Native American to score a plum teaching gig.
looks like people have figured you out redskin.
Fuck you, you cancerous cunt traitor.
Lame but effective.  Wait for the fraud when gov't offers free tuition
Laureate Education paid Bill Clinton $16.5 million to serve part-time as "honorary chancellor" in 2010 #Hypocrite @SenWarren @usedgov
another lame trick, throwing more  after bad  bloating the dept of Ed & allowing teachers unions 2 call the shots!
@SenWarren @usedgov
- Pence's INGOPSupers boosted *voucher* system to divert public-edu $ to private/religious schools --almost all relig
las trasnacionales se unen trasversalmente en el mundo para oprimirnos, debemos hacer lo mismo para intentar liberarnos
online univ's do this and MANY two year colleges do as well.   We once said students quitting after 2 yrs were dropouts
Wish you could do something to get @EliotSpitzer back into gov service to work w you to bring down all the white collar criminals
lets just make it all free, That way I can quit working, yeahh I want to be entitled dead beat
The @usedgov should not let any 'for profit' be involved with FFELP loans. Largest % of defaults.
Amateurs. We all know the best way to skirt government rules and oversight is to donate to the Clinton Foundation.
because we only want the ultra liberal staff at state universities to profit
Which one? Does it operate nationally?
using words like "lame" is offensive to differently abled people
goofy Pocahontas
Goofy racist
