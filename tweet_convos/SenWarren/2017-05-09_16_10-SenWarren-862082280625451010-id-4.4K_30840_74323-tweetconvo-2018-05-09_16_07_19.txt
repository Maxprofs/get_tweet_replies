You are the worst kind of liar! Investigations do not end because the director changes.
THERE ARE NO TIES TO RUSSIA!! Stop making things up with no evidence. POTUS has every right to fire Comey for incompetence.
Yours in May, and here it is beginning Sept, and Mueller still has nothing.  Please make that Nothingburger with pickleslettucetomatoonion
Ok but its still the same end result isn't it? think when a hunter shoots a deer "now i ask ya do you think the deer cares what ur wearing"?
I predict Trump will resign via Twitter!  That would be the ultimate!
I don't think he'll finish this term the way things are going.  Every day its a new catastrophe.  It's exhausting!
Yet here we are at the beginning of Sept.  and NOTHING has changed.  Remarkable
I try very hard to stay neutral.  Political views cause arguments
No, it's because he sucks, you know it , Trump knows it the American people know it.  Stop! #boywhocriedwolf
Yet it's Sept 1, and he's still POTUS.  Hows that workin for ya?
Good.
WE DEMAND AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION, PROSECUTOR NOW!  VERY  dangerous times we live in. This man is out of control blatant abuse of power
It's either that BIG MOUTH LITTERLY WATERS OR POCAHONTAS. IMPEACH IMPEACH. What about your boy Odummy? Impeach him.
Nope, he fired Comey because he gave Hillary a free pass and he didn't do his job! Hopefully you'll be gone soon too Fauxahontas...
No no one thinks that.he fired him cuz he was ineffective and not doing a good job. See,hes the president of the United States of America
Enough with the sarcastic tweets. Get the impeachment done or an arrest for treasonous activities, or tax evasion. Tweeting is not your job.
And here it is beginning Sept.  And still nothing.  Ever think there might be nothing?  Grandstanding isn't her job either, try to stop her.
Nope
@frankhowell7911 @realDonaldTrump 
Nope.
No way!
So he interfered with his investigation, isn't that unlawful!!!
Total abuse of power
It is his right to do it. Bill Clinton did the same thing. No abuse of power
It is when he fires someone who is investigating his administration
Did he fire the entire FBI or do you believe only 1 person is investigating?
I love how no matter how ridiculous and treasonous trump's actions get, his loyal supporters STILL swallow all that BS! It's pretty scary.
I feel I'm on the constant verge of having a stoke every time I feud w/ one-Their incoherent ramblings that all end w/ name calling are sick
Scarey times everyday!
I think Comey fell on his sword. But why?
Roflmao!  We need a hostile take over of this dictator and his regime!  45 and his minions and acolytes have quietly taken over the US!
45 should recuse himself  because he has demonstrated that he is not able to effectively lead the nation ... unless it's on a golf trip.
HELL NO WE ARE NOT THAT NIAVE, #Obstruction #Treason #RussiaGate #IndependentInvestigation #Got2Close 2Truth #StayTheCourse #SmokeAndFire
Worse than DICK NIXON. Call for #impeachment  @VP @BetsyDeVosED @MichaelCohen212 #Russiagate #SpecialProsecutor #LockThemUp #ImpeachTrump
Flynn and Manafort were not caught doing anything but talking to Russians and they lied about it. So please with your bullshit.
WRONG! Flynn pled guilty to lying to the FBI in a plea deal. They certainly have much more on him to have made him flip! If he stops working with the special counsel, those more serious charges will come out (and on his son). 
Manafort is charged with MUCH more than lying to FBI!
And my point was that neither of their charges had a thing to do with Trump colluding with Russians. 
He didn't FLIP. That is news BS. If he flipped there would be charges on Trump.
The White House cannot be trusted to investigate the White House. Period. We need a Special Prosecutor / Independent investigation. Now!
No!
Only #tRumPublicans who are loyal to the #traitorNcheeto that 45 is #ImpeachTrump #TrumpRussiaInvestigation #maGAAGAAGOOGOOGAAGAA
Um, no.
No. No one believes it. Can the US government stop bickering on @Twitter and put a stop to this madness?  @washingtonpost @nytimes #weneedu
If stopping a psychotic desperate old crook is only going to be up to the US government then we are F*cked. #WeThePeople
When draining a swamp there is always a lot of stink!
Especially when draining the swamp involves replacing the muck with Trump's leech infested family & his close personal friends looking for $
Grow up. What did you expect? Angels?
@DianeSweezerDav @realDonaldTrump And tomorrow this Dunce in Chief will claim "fake news" tomorrow. He's getting scared.
#hellno
Duh!
Haha
No ma'am!
America has had enough of his bull shit.
Impeach him now!
TrumpTaxes will be subpoenaed as a result. 

@SenDanSullivan  @lisamurkowski
@GOP will pay the price for this. You can't justify this as anything other than obstruction. You will be remembered as cowards and colluders
About 35% believe, Elizabeth.

They wear red baseball caps.
So the FBI can't continue running without him? However anyone feels about DT still zero evidence with lots of energy/time already invested.
Just a time sink listening to inanity on behind both sides
No
Hell No only a toothless illiterate backwoods slow would believe Ok we r outraged now what Nothing  Impeach DJT and all his minions
Nope
So what are you going to DO about it, Senator?

L
Only Trashy Trump supporters, who believe anything that liar says.  @RealDonaldTrump-please leave office
The question is..what do we do now?
SOMETHING, one hopes.
Hire Antifa would be my guess... but thats none of my business
Not even the people who are paid to believe it believe it.
Does anyone really believe that you are an Indian. You were asked to take a DNA test, but still haven't. Why?
It would be hilarious if it wasn't our country that the Trump family & admin are trying to turn into a dictatorship. #illegitimatePresident
You prefer Islam and Sharia?
Oh come on you wanted Comey out don't be a hypocrite Pocahontas.
What will be his excuse if he fires Bob Mueller?
Comey knew too much/refused to be Trumps slave no more. Trump is demented/to be feared.Dangerous, nut job. Time for Congress to act. impeach
No way. It is totally for his own self serving benefit.
##notabot
*I* do. He's a very compassionate man, always concerned with helping others and supporting...oh wait i this isn't the Bizarro universe?
Firing the person investigating you is an admission of guilt #TrumpTreason #IMPEACH
It's obvious to my 10 yr old who actively pays attention to this whole administration and what is happening in the country he's inheriting
I hope by the time he's grown up there's something resembling what our country is (or used to be before trump) still here for him to inherit
What rock did you crawl out from?
@6string_machine @realDonaldTrump Yes! Jeff Sessions, Bannon, Conway and most disturbing Rod Rosenstein. Does anyone else matter?
Employees fired by Trump:
Sally Yates
Preet Bharara
James Comey

Employees investigating Trump:
Sally Yates
Preet Bharara
James Comey
Preet wasn't investigating Trump. Comey was investigating people below Trump. Not Trump directly. Yates wasn't investigating Anyone.
Right on. The Snowflakes are blinded by the blizzard.
Does anyone seriously believe the way to avoid an investigation would be to fire a figurehead?   #CommieLogic #LockHerUp
Wish I'd seen this closer to the date posted.  One of the best replies I've seen to date
Lizzie, please sit down before u get embarrassed again.
Those Comey FBI FISA sharing of intelligence 2 unauthorized third parties is coming at ya kinda hard right about now isnt it.Loss 4 words?

I'd call this slanted logic.  01010001110101
So he fired the entire FBI?
Impeach his lying criminal butt time for senate & Congress to take this country back from a fascist lying president
Hey, guess what, it's the beginning of Sept, and Mueller still has nothing.  Hows that workin for ya?
It had nothing to do with either one of these reasons, Comey is an idiot, plain and simple
Ah, nope not one little iota.
#liars #fakenews #NoPCFACHISTS
But seriously senator pochahantas, does anyone really believe you are part Native American?
WaPo headline tomorrow seems to think that is more important than Russia.
Tomorrow's front page. The rare-ish six-column headline. 
Old news...zzzzzzzz crickets. New: dem congress is doing....here's where YOU fill in the blank. Stop pandering. We've been telling u 4 weeks
No fucking way. He's guilty.
Please tell us what we can do about it?
Does anyone really think he would fire the one person who can take him down , IF HE WAS GUILTY ? Nothing to see here. Move along
As a matter of fact, there would not be President Trump if you did not push your own agenda ..if you cared for America,more than self,
apparently only Fox News addicts.
No Fauxahontas we don't believe that.  We also don't buy that russia and Trunk fixed the election.  #norussianconnection
No one believes anything that comes out of your "native" mouth, let alone your strawman tweets.
Not even Trump supporters would believe that!
Stop dividing the nation w/ this false narrative, it's dangerous & irresponsible. He was fired was bc he mishandled the email investigation
Hell no one  will believe such a lied from hell
Only if they've had their heads up their asses or stuck in sand...
You blamed him for Hillay's loss...you called for him to resign! I hate politicians all hypocrites!

By the lack of outcry, it appears most of #gop thinks #trump's firing of #comey is acceptable & nothing to do with #trumprussia cover-up.
One of his dumbest lies ever. It's becoming far too corrupt to keep up with. Fire or impeach them ALL. Yes, you and your cohorts Trump.
Youre sick! This Russia propaganda your spouting is Pathetic! Youll never get it! Your party has been LOOSING get use 2 it! Dems are DONE!
Hell yes we do...funny how U libetards wanted him gone but now its collusion....crazy!!!
Excuse given 4 firing was Comey's handling of HC emails. Sessions RECUSED self from anything to do w/this (in addition to #TrumpRussia)
He fired Comey because the noose was tightening around his neck & he could feel the devil fight his ass.
Rrrrriiiight. And your proof is where?  Oh, that's right. No proof at all. Just pure speculation. And you used the word "noose" RACIST! Haha
Not for a minute. Please, do something to stop this madness!
No Senatorr Warren.  It was that Comey was to close for comfort for uncovering the Russia scandal.  Comey would not step back
Only idiots believe that.
Only some of his ignorant followers who blamed Obama for 9/11 &  said they voted for DT because at least he tells the truth. #Unbelievable
ABSOLUTELY NOT!!
You politicians look for any excuse to confirm your biases.
Hell no. NOBODY believes him. His zombies defend him by choosing to live in their sad bubble.
Not when he has shown a blatant disdain for her. Everyone knows the truth whether they accept it or not. Trump must be Impeached ASAP!
If such a person exists, they're delusional.
No he fired him for doing a piss poor job. Just like the American public will do to you when your up for reelection.#draintheswamp #MAGA
is trump admitting that he won  unfairly????????????
Not for one damned minute.
No one in right mind will believe that!
Let's think here. So a director got fired. That means that "all" investigations stop? Give me a break. Use some logic.
I don't.
Sen Waren just becaue Comey was fired does not mean the investation will not go on. And, we also know that Sen Clinton would have fired him
Who cares?  Don't you have some important work to do?
President with 3 million less votes moves to dictator stage -abusive aggro incompetent - can't cope with any who question or disagree-danger
Oh hell no!  Only his ignorant followers!
He does
Nope
He thinks it helps his ratings.  Please, save us @SenWarren
No! Impeach @realDonaldTrump now!!!
I reported #TrumpTreason FBI 2014  was threatened by him with"being ruined"if did.#DespotDon guilty of fedl witness tampering
No!!
No.  Hillary is probably laughing her ass off at that one.
People believe the weirdest things like U having Indian heritage & voted 4 U, 2 made U their senator! Heck, some believe Obama walk on H2O!
No! He was fired for violating the FBI's Rules, and trying to subvert the office of the Attorney General. Integrity is back at the FBI!
Of course not, but what in the world does that have to do with the Russia tampering
Absolutely not.
Yeah it went from lock her up to don't lock me up.
Nope. Don't believe that at all.
Hell no you better block every thing that he trying to do.
No
Lol... Absolutely not.
Please continue to work hard for us. It's a scary time in our country.
No way!
Not all all... Special Prosecutor needed now @SenatorBurr
Not even for a minute. But see Donnie, you fired him. That means he knows what you are up to & now he is pissed & a private citizen. 
No one takes seriously anything from a Disney character

Does anyone seriously believe Hillary didn't delete 30K emails and funnel money to Clinton Foundation and was let off by Comey? You HARPY!!!
No. It's another revenge tactic. When he's afraid of being investigated he fires whoever gets too close. He warns others to be loyal or else
Nope #impeachment
People think some Unfathomable crap, in the interests of their own confirmation bias
As surely as I believe John Wilkes Booth felt bad for ruining the Lincoln's night out.
Nobody believes anything #SoCalledPresident @realDonaldTrump says.He's proven himself totally untrustworthy. He's ridiculed around the world
How much longer do we need to take the torture from this blooming orange lying idiot? Bottom crawler 
Vladimir Putin
No way! Not buying it. Nonsensical.
"He wasn't do a good job" ....
No. I think he is getting scared
