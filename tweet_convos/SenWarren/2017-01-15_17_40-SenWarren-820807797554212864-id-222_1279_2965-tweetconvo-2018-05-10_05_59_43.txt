It's the American People that want ACA repealed, not just the GOP.
nope polls show majority want to keep it
same polls that had Hillary winning easy right?
she won by 2%..most polls said about 4%..but typical of pres polls
Don't worry about it Lizzy! The republicans will develop a much better medical program than you liberals.
uh huh. Suuure they will.

that ISN'T a marketplace plan. That's insurance screwing you not the ACA.
you like obama care???
I am very blessed to not have to use it, however I have many friends for whom it has been a godsend.
apparently it has some problems though and does need to be fixed well making sure everyone's OK
Then, I can once again afford health insurance !!!
The mandatory ACA is offensive because we are being FORCED into buying insurance we may not want.
nope.. U don't have 2 buy insurance however u do pay  fee to help offset emergency room freeloaders
Do illegals get free medical care or do they need to purchase this as we do? How does that work?
per Fed law ANYONE w/o ins can get free care at emergency room.. Nothing 2 do w ACA.. not new
So if immigrant lands here they receive resettlement checks1700 a month, medical, ebt benefits?
My family lost our health care under ACA, went from $428 a month to $6000 a month. Can't pay that!! #ACAsucks
you need to stop the Destruction of Dodd-Frank.  Don't let us down!
Will you stand with women striking from all the work we do Jan 20-21? #Womenstrike
Yes they do, stopping lying and fear mongering.
@alitaleader nobody would grab her or your pussy ! Yuck
I suspect that if they gave a viable alternative, you'd vote against it simply because the GOP came up with it
Er ACA was GOP plan including mandate
And now the shoe is on the other foot. Both sides of the aisle are partisan hacks
INVESTIGATE NOW! Read #DworkinReport AND follow @Khanoisseur! SMOKING GUN FOUND
Spot on! I live in NE & terrified of losing ins. Feel like I have no voice: I'm blue person living in red state.
your not going to loose your insurance it's going to be replaced stop believing the LIES
I sincerely hope you are right.
STOP lying & saying GOP doesn't have a replacement We've talked about our healthcare wants for decades" including keeping ur dr
Senator, just want to thank you. I am deeply saddened by Trump. How can we help? Wish I was 20 again.
Get use to losing 1030+ Democrat loses since 2008 Idiotic LIBERAL policies soundly rejected #MAGA2017-2024
THERE YOU GO LYING AGAIN !! YOU LIBS NEED TO GET A GRIP & STOP THIS CHILDISHNESS !!
@SenSchumer @BostonGlobe @GOP #KeepAmericaSick
you aren't going to the inauguration right? Please come out and say it. And the women's march will u be there with us?
GOP always wanted health savings account SO you can buy your own plan & if you don't use all the money you'll get the remaining
@SenSanders @GOP I have rheumatoid arthritis and would have hit a lifetime cap without ACA. Anyone can get sick, even the GOP!
@SenSchumer they have already started making cuts they started the first day of December we are becoming a group now
Gottit Liz. Now U consider wat wuz @ stake if DemEstab support Hil over Bernie. #TrumpLosesToBernie
@SenSchumer @BostonGlobe @GOP Stop Trump!
Not a Chance
@SenSchumer @BostonGlobe @GOP Ma would be better with your sorry ass
@SenSchumer @BostonGlobe @GOP Not a lot of support, Lizzy.
How about you go on the ACA plan and pay for it?
Princess, you're washed up.
The real question is what will happen if it isn't repealed & replaced. It is BROKEN & killing us!
chuck are u sure u want to be linked with her ? she’s out of favor forever
STOP the lies those of us working in HC have watched ACA take from elderly
Even Bill Clinton said it stinks. Only works 4 people getting it for free or heavy subsides. Rest pay big $$$
a great barometer in life is if Elizabeth Warren is for it you should be against it and vice versa
Pocahontas is delusional
It's more like repeal & budget transfer from fed to state. Mass. will have 2 spend more on ACA eventually.
Senator,

Please join lawmakers and representatives in boycotting the Trump inauguration.

Save our republic.

Warren will be in trouble next year. We in Massachusetts are going to protest and fight for her to lose.
All we have is nurses assitants and they are killing us. Bring back our doctors get repeal and replace.
Doctors are leaving.We do not have quality health care. These people are illegals, why should we support them.
ACA Higher cost, middle class is going broke. Repeal and Replace the law. Clinton said it was bad
We do not want the ACA.Middle class have to pay for all these illegals. We lost are doctors&we have higher cost
Back at you Lizzie!
You are one of the most useless irrelevant Senators All sound & fury but do nothing, add nothing & bring nothing to the table
if the states want to pay for obama care let them pay!!! We are tired of paying for others. Not working!!
Repeal Bama care now. Don't work. Ma health works. On.. By the way  you're catching up to Trumps tweet count.
@ManMet80 Senator Warren PLEASE RUN FOR PRESIDENT!  Hopefully you will b able to fix what DJT did from 2017-2020! 
What the hell is wrong with you Ms Warren? You're an embarassment to our State. What, were you not loved as a child?
Did the citizens of Boston elect you to spend all your time fundraising and going after Trump?

haha, you guys LOST, it's OVER... take all the stands you want, hahahaha!!!
Mass Health?
No one reads the Globe.  Fake news.  Try sending up some smoke signals or beating the tom tom.

please help write a bill that helps the tech world wake up to unfair hiring practices ...!...
Repeal and Run IS for cowards..
"Not Trump" wasn't a viable campaign strategy; "Don't Repeal" isn't a viable ACA strategy. Dems need a "Keep & Improve" movement.
Afraid like I am to lose ACA  like me. We need to be heard. Plz share your story http://FacesoftheACA.com .
How come the people who have a 5% approval rating think they have all the answers?
You are a hero your constituents in Massachusetts and tens of millions of citizens in the rest of the country.
Dump Obama care fast it's useless insurance. We increase premiums so we could give poor & illegals 5k deducts
you support a republic that sues nuns to violate their religious beliefs because yours is more important!
we asked the Feds for waivers since it would hurt small business! You and your fellow dems did NOTHING to help
boycott the inauguration!
are u still pretending to be a Native American?
How can we believe u when ur a political hack? Politics over people=DT. You made your bed. Now sleep in it.
@dnc Please call on your colleagues “There comes a time when silence is betrayal.”Martin Luther King Jr. real quite from the Dems
Give us the same health care that you have for the same price.  I am your employer yet get nothing NOT RIGHT!!!
@susanb2658 @BostonGlobe @GOP  the hashtag is #SaveObamacare
thanks for taking a stand to#savehealthcare
Reduce healthcare cost!

Elizabeth Warren is spinmeister. Listen closely. Her rhetoric is a lesson in speciousness.
Dems implemented the ACA. Millions lost policies/doctors they liked. But who cares? Not Democrats, not Warren.
THE GOVERNMENT HAS ABSOLUTELY NO RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT MY BODY AND MY HEALTHCARE.WHY WOULD ANYBODY WANT THAT
Squaw Lady has no credibility.
Healthcare dashboard needed.  To baseline ACA accomplishments, versus GOP [no content yet].
ACA is going away and you are shameless fraud. You've accomplished nothing in your career

is a liar! Even that other disgusting democRAT #SLICKWILLY Clinton said it was a bad law & hurts people! @BostonGlobe @GOP @OANN
I was hoping she would "Champion" a bill to put all our political "leaders" in Obamacare.. not likely!
so will u apologize if they have a better plan?
The @GOP never intended to replace #ACA. They've long preferred the poor be limited to charity or nothing.
do you really want us to believe you wrote it. Your ghostwriters name is????.the person you take credit for
even Globe Op Ed said you were an ideologue and nothing has changed! You lied the day u took office and go on
Considering MA has its own mandatory healthcare laws, nothing will happen to MA residents with ACA repeal.
the Senate Democrats need to expose their scam.
Cry my beloved country (borrowed from Alan Paton)
considering every democrat voted for a 2700 page law that no one read it understood and u exempted yourselves
@TheOriginalTKO   The GOP has no plan, no strategy, no anything.  Why the repeal?  Trump does not care!!!
omg you are unbelievable! Embarrassing!
Thank you @SenWarren! Great to hear you  today & lucky to have you to fight for us! #savehealthcare
Well, Republicans forced Dems to bail out corporations!!! Next time, we're bailing out people!!!
Obvious that ACA was dying on its own.  Now we have a chance to put in a real program that won't be another tax payer subsidized foible
STFU Pocahontas
Illness doesn't stop CAPS!
2011:DX w/#kidneycancer; 2013:DX w/#Lupus(Daily Meds/Mthly Infusion); 2014:DX w/#pituitarytumor+#brainsurgery. CAPS don't stop illness! #ACA https://twitter.com/ajbraywrites/status/819788311950598145 …
Stop the fear mongering sitting bull and watch the TRUTH!
this is what it seems like they are saying to us.
Keep fighting ELizabeth !
Well said, Senator Warren.  I worry for myself and many family and friends who will loose if ACA is repealed.
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Thank You
bull shit, it's s redistribution freeloaders bill that screwed hard working Americans
SS and Medicare are plans paid for by employees and employers. Another moronic comment
Plus, who will be forced to pay for all of our baby killings if the ACA is repealed?

There will be a revolution if they repeal ACA . ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!!
you just need to learn to shut that trap of yours your a lunatic Pocahontas!
did you get paid 4 hundred k to teach a class at Harvard no wonder why tuition is so much #phony
@DanScavino Horsefeathers
so you admit that ACA is riddled w/ ridiculously high Premiums & a shoddy network? Finally! Left Admitting failure!
because it is free market and government does not control prices or insurance premiums.. Should it?
the second paragraph of the article says ACA premiums are high and the network is minimal.

unimpressive, Senator. Trumpcare, whatever it is, has a 90% chance to be better for those in need, sight unseen



#saveourhealthcare #OurFirstStand #OurRevolution Why does #GOP #hate #humanity so fucking much?! #punkasstwats
I'm with you senator
Citizens are forced to buy insurance that is unaffordable, if you don't buy it you pay extortion penalty.
Which part? You're so dumb or that its unaffordable & extortion, which are all true.
michael step off you are speaking to a US Senator! Paid troll go back to Russia! @USATODAY
freshdoeboy silly troll name  @USATrollWatch
You work so hard, we know how dedicated you are. You really are thank you for your service and integrity. 
they're going to repeal it so suck it up

here you are lying again. MA and IN are the only 2 states where prem are going down, screw the rest of the USA
Lizzy you remain Irrelevant and Obscure. Hillary dropped you, and we dont want to hear you. Just take your pandering crap and get lost
new plan by Republicans "WEDON'TCARE" healthplan
thank you for working so hard for MA and our country. You are one of the good ones, I tell my kids.
Well done 

1000s turn out in Hollywood to #saveourhealthcare!!! #SaveACA #OurFirstStand 
OCARE is a complete failure if you cared you work to repeal and replace it with something that works 
2018 BYE
Problem is the GOP care about $$$ not humans!  #impeachmentcountdown
Why weren't you this motivated two yrs ago? Prior to cost spiking, major carriers leaving.
.@SenWarren @BostonGlobe @GOP Dems in MELTDOWN saving their failing ACA..STUPID CAUSE EVERYONE KNOW HOW MUCH IT COST..WHY have DEMs lost big
What a scare tactic. USA had best health system in the world before obama messed it up. Will have again!
and what exactly was that "best healthcare" you are referring to? Smh.. another moron
 @SenWarren @BostonGlobe @GOP
Can't explain the obvious to the oblivious. Save any elephants lately. Hahahaha!
sorry  you are not legitimate
you're one of the iconic figures of current democracy. I love you so much.

What a pain you are @realDonaldTrump. It's the anxiety in your antacid routine. I respect @SenWarren @JohnLewis #ACA work  it
nothing. We have insurance either way

please make sure you represent the other side of the equation and the downside for keeping it. #fairness
Exactly. They could shoot a person down main street and still repeal the act.

trump announced in wapo plan for low deducts coverage for all drug negotiations and affordable? Universal?
Bwahahaha @lspreack you actually believe him? Trump is a pathological liargood luck with that
no just seems like a total reversal of what the GOP wants he is calling for universal care
problem? From start of ACA--GOP BEEN JEALOUSY of  it as it showed them as inept/unable to create Healthcare.
Meh....nahhhhh @SenWarren
now we know the joke is on us I have been hurt #Obamacare
Go Elizabeth Warren. Last hope for the USA?
big surprise that is why they are called the Wrecking Crew, destroy not build @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan
I will say that H lost the election because white men were disgusted by you, even more than by H.
look in the mirror my friend
very democratic of you. People, disregard this liar. She is full of sh*t. Sen Rand Paul has a plan in motion.
