Right, he is on the side of mid-tier banks being able to open/operate so consumers have more choices, @SenWarren @dahkotaC
and you are drinking kool-aid. And again, off point. Trump's "swamp" is quickly becoming quicksand. Hope you have a rope.
Oh, please keep up your shallow assessments. We keep winning when you do this, @dahkotaC. It is fantastic!!
keep believing. You will get exactly what you deserve. Hahahahahahaha!
.@dahkotaC which is what exactly? Name what I deserve. Go ahead. I can't wait to hear this.
We know whose side Trump is on: the banksters, billionaires, big oil, Wall Street, & foreign dictators. @SenWarren
.@realDonaldTrump talked a big game about Wall St during his campaign – but as @POTUS, we're finding out whose side he's really on.
@willow__baby 
Not only is Trump NOT draining the swamp, he's making it his own.
I knew all along. He cast his hate for #hillary to win the election. #NoBanNoWall #noDevos

To prove a politician isn't in it 4 money/power...Americans should see all their personal money+assets + for 25 yrs after office.
I wonder if wall street's gonna love the way Trump keeps instability as his norm? Guess they only care about 1 day at a time.
and you backed Wall streets puppet@HillaryClinton. #TheNerveYouHave
I don't get why his followers are OUTRAGED nominating, deregulating so they can start 2008 all over again

OMG... can we please stop "but the emails" or Benghazi. 4This woman was investigated and attacked for 25years! No Charges. DONE!
What about Trump's phone? His taxes? His ties with Russia? The Congressional investigation now? Trump needs to answer now.
I'm sure the CIA is working on it 
Hopefully, they're working on Russia and DJT collusion.
I'm more concerned with institutionalized racism and mass incarceration in the US. No evidence of Russian election interference
I don't really feel protected by the "checks & balances" of the gov't right now, is there a line that can't be crossed?
Nope. Let's face it, money talks, Big Money talks BIGLY
That makes me Tremendously nervous, the system failed Bigly.
Dear Spreading Bull Please retire to your "Reservation"
Funny you should mention drain the swamp... Fucking moron. Fuck off.
Do you wear the large #DEMocRAT vagina costume or just the one that goes over your face??
.@SenWarren The Democrats are consumed by hate.  They are so blinded by the hate and their loss of power. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
.@SenWarren <- You need to get God in your life, maybe then you won't be so hateful ALL the time. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS

O help us PLEASE.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The American people and America. Some one has to care about us.

"TeePee makers MUST be regulated more"
Your attitude toward Wall Street is like a jockey saying, "Il'l hobble my horse and win the race". Won't
Why is this a shock to anyone?He bragged that he"worked the system for his co." People thought he was going to change& work 4them
.@SenWarren Call it what it is! Another @realDonaldTrump LIE! Filled Cabinet with Wall St. and MM BB! Now out to kill #DoddFrank @POTUS
@barbls23 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS most of us already knew
he's such a dick
.@SenWarren .@realDonaldTrump .@POTUS Pocahontas!!!
You count on the average American not knowing that Dodd Frank hurt the little community banks.
He's still nothing but a Puppet for the Bankers. Can't think on his own. Needs help coloring in his book.
you talked a big game about being Native American. #Fauxcahontas
Business is not the problem. stop trying to use class warfare.The prob is govt punishment of biz owners
Yes we have. He's on the side of the American people.

he is a liar and a flip-flopper after criticizing President Obama and Hillary now look at him
You talked a big game & then shilled for Hillary instead of backing Bernie. Whose side r u on?
.@AnthroGirl73 @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @POTUS agreed w what she said but she played a big part in giving us all Trump! Congrats Warren
he is on the constitution's side.
@Patriotsartist @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You are a loathsome #SelfServingPOS, Warren!
some of us already knew
Steve Schwartzman,Larry Fink,Jamie Dimon! Gimme a break! He drained nothing!!
you would have won handily.  Only Hillary could have lost to trump.
.   Why o why did you not run senator warren ?
why don't people see through this fraud ?
I was never surprised about that
@llstudent08 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS   ENOUGH OF THE TALK LIZZY AND OVERTHROW/IMPEACH GOP/TRUMP
You talked a big game about change and hope and a better country. But all we got was 0. America is 14 in education. Such change.
@TheRealAprilK @realDonaldTrump @POTUS We knew.

tRump is a Grifter, whomever believes him is just doomed!.
I can't believe people bought those lies during campaign.
pocahontas please shut up.
@lackland50 @realDonaldTrump   The schmuck doesn't even bother hiding it!!
We always knew who's side he was on, his side. The rich get richer, the poor get poorer. #falsepresident
No president has EVER stuck so closely to election promises post inauguration, as a matter of fact. You work for us, do your job
same side as you, apparently. #41milli
President Stephen K. Bannon and his puppet trump are big friends of the 1% but not of you or me.
what about you,Granny? Make $$ off the backs of college students? Phony
You stood UP to support demonic Hillary and her admin, including Podesta. #spiritcooking
Forget about your straw man argument, explain THIS.
How can you justify being
critical before any change is proposed? You should Resign!
can't congress do anything about this??  We can't this maniac just DO This?
yes #WeThePeople #getusedtoit #ChiefTalkingBull
You cheated to get into college. Zero credibility
So what's the plan to stop him? So many words. So little action. I am on your side but man y'all have no plan.
as if we didn't  already know...Who's sorry now?
look in the mirror LIAR, you stole money.  How about your 1.3 million line of credit you didnt report.
@jscherretz @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Pocahontas go back to lying about you being a Native American and taking $$ from Wallstreet
Burn! You told her! Great comeback! I think it's the first time she's ever heard that. I bet she's crushed. You sure bring it!
You do realize the irony in this statement, right?
some.. but still she is a liar and took millions from Wallstreet she is a hypocrite and a race baiting bitch
What's that make Trump, Conway, Spicer and all the other fascists? Wait, I know...the exact same thing. Name calling=useless
we have always known he was going to be on the bridge span side. The middle class was just being misguide
guilty of everything he accused Hillary of.
. One talks to GS and is "crooked" - the other hires two GS and says he's making us Great Again...save us!
Please refer to himin the thruth #BLOTUS Biggest Liar of the United States and/or #MinorityPresident #MercerPuppet #PutinPuppet

Trump's true colors
*keep Trump/R's actions that hurt the people/planet and benefit the Rich/Corps. Not MAGA!

@markburgerenerg @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
His "Friends"...can't get loans... the middle class can't continue to suffer...

"@damiranz: DonaldTrump: Pls don't run for president. If you do and win, the rest of the world would be screwed" So true, (except friends)!
We knew all along whose side he is really on - anyone who thought differently was fooled. Now, what are you going to do about it?
Lots of opinionated pussies in here.  I wonder if there's any correlation? 
We need all Americans to pull together, help Trump make this a great Nation. Wish Dem would stop the BS!
Yeah - the same side as HRC.  That's why it didn't matter.  The Dems lost this campaign in the primary.  Where were you then?
Who's surprised? Not me!
He is on his side. Nobody's side but his own.
pretending to b an Indian: free ride to Harvard. Staying relevant off Donald Trump's name: priceless
I think that's obvious #SwampCabinet #SwampRegime #ConflictsOfInterest #ReleaseYourTaxes
always stirring the pot why don't you run in four years
TRUMPS ONLY ALLEGIANCE IS TO MONEY! TRUMPS VISION OF EDUCATION!!??? IS BETSY DEVOS! I REST MY CASE! Ugh!!
We are finding full #Transparency revealing tht Cabinet doesn't hold POTUS positions #StillSanders
So glad we have a Successful businessman to straight this mess out. Instead of some idiot professor.
Preach #notmypresident

Why @SenWarren  did Dems screw up and not prosecute WallSt? @realDonaldTrump @POTUS

good lord girl grow up!
He's only ever been on his own side.
& the People think they took their Government back   stacked with Exxon/oil & Goldman Sach crooks the only 1 winning is Putin $$
Mr. Trump is on the side of all Americans. You, are disposable, and I hope you're disposed of soon.
#notmypresident trump will bankrupt this country
I'm not surprised. Is anybody surprised? No? I didn't think so.
: #Fascism #ReleaseYourTaxes #GoldmanSachs #WellsFargo #Resistance #BanBannon #StopTrump
Bannon subterfuge, deluge the media with lies and misdirect while aiming to destroy middle class obviously , great lie
the senator who lied to get a job at Harvard.  Your a thief who stole a job from a true Native American
Never a doubt of whose side he was on. We now have proof.
Yep, Donald is in it for Donald. There is not one person more disconnected from needs of working class.
top of the swamp, such a roadshow of gypsies making their own rules, sad!
Trump has never been on any ones side but his own.
y r u constantly attacking and undermining @POTUS?  You had your chance, how about some support for @realDonaldTrump??

why are taxpayers footing the bill for Trump Jr's business trip to Uruguay ?
Such a liar!
the SWAMP IS OOZING.
wait, isn't he on the side of the ppl who elected him? #outoftouch @realDonaldTrump @ellet50 @PhlLegalCenter @DishingItBlunt
he's on his side. Plain and simple
has one of the most popular tweets to @realDonaldTrump today - via http://PolitiTrends.com 
please don't give into him and his disgusting minions.
not same as Killarney who took millions to finance campaign. But you don't want to talk about that!
trump's base will figure it out when they get NOTHING from him!  He's making it easier for#LKQ
I'm just as surprised as you, Senator. 

#sarcasm #fuckTrump
Yes Trump is on America's side unlike you Elizabeth
we sure are . Himself and billionaire friends!!
you are and always been a looser
yes Elizabeth Warren we know whose side you are on, the obamas and clintons. you traitor to America
never lied about his origin like you.
And it's not on the side of the American people. Drain the swamp has turned into restocking with slime.
and we're not remotely surprised.
trump is in it for his friends. He made no bones about it.
Pls keep up the good work & get another R to vote aga Devos. My ADA child deserves needed assistance.
#MRPresidentDonaldTrump is ON #AMERICA's  & #Americans SIDE... unlike you!!!!!!!!!
well of course he is they are the ones who hire the people that voted for him
I had assumed this was his entire motive for running. More profitable business environ for him. Conflict!
Read the actual EO. It's designed to help small banks while keeping restrictions on big Wall St banks.
why does this shock anyone? He made his money scamming and cheating everyone he could. Look at his lawsiuts. He won't show taxes
Trump is not on the side of Americans, he is about Trump & only Trunp...sad
why did all the dopes who will be duped vote for him ?
because all of us dopes wanted something new tired of getting duped by the likes of warren
I think we already knew whose side he was REALLY on. Not ours.
populism a la Goldman Sachs
I've never been hired by a poor person.  Quit it Pocohontas.  The people see through your lies.
you know that's false, less regs and smaller banks can loan money your party took that away so now your mad no kickbacks for you
because talk is cheap he says what's was good for  moment actions are what's telling
