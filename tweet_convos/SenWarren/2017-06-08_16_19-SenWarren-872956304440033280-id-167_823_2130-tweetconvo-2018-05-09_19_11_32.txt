There is absolutely nothing more corrupt and dishonest than the GOP at this point in time. That wasn't always the norm. Shameful. Disgusting
@RepChrisSmith GOP used to stand for the rule of law. Now it is all about Money = god. Try standing up for real values and real people.
How much did you charge to teach that course again?
Like you get no money from companies
You know who TAKES most of that money? You guessed it. The DEMOCRAT party.
Warren/Sanders 2020
Copper u need help.
Because you don't agree with my politics I must be crazy... Lol I mean give me something... An issue, another option... Something... Lol
You take their money too. #partisanhack #shutupLiz
and your the 1st person with a hand out for your share
They always have
And mostly DemoKraks get the money...
RUN FOR PRESIDENT
Isn't the acceptance of bribes by GOP a crime?
Get cnn to have town halls on this subject, you and some experts to explain to citizens.
Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell are something else, aren't they?  The people who voted for the republicans want this???
Is it just me, or does our government look pretty Swampy right about now?!
Clinton Foundation ring a bell Liz? They can tell you all about outside money.
And you get more than your fair share
Get ready. Every 10 yrs the market "corrects".  Banks will use this fact 2 further rip mortgagees, scam us (gov't) & get richer! BEWARE
Do U mean former the Senators/House members w/ lifetime access to the floor of their respective Chambers? Those lobbyists? #Fauxchohontas
How can lobbyists be banned from Congress?
Are you going to tell us that you've NEVER accepted anything from a lobbyist during your entire political career? #hardtobelieve
Some of you are ridiculous, she is talking about our finance that may not be managing well by wall street and we get into our fatism stand
How about you point your fake vitriol at big pharma to help with opiod club crisis instead of forcing taxpayers to bear the burden
Their lobbyists receive ethics waivers galore from the White House
Of course you are holier than thou....
You are watching millions lose coverage&you have the nerve to slander the GOP that is trying to clean up the mess you all made?!SHUT UP
and you side with hillary @randyprine @HouseGOP
You want to drive small banks out of business.
Democrats get contributions from big NY banks.
Thus, you hate Choice.
if that's illegal, then put them in jail!
Wouldn't we need lobbyists to fight lobbyists?... goddamit . How do we beat them?
#theswampisoverflowing Mainly because Trump has given ethics waivers to his whole staff.
Yep, right in your Democratic pockets!
If you actually did something in the Senate we might take you seriously..just another political hack

We the ppl seriously need HELP. Is an 'American spring' possible?
both sides benefit from lobbyists- u r in a position to stop it- BUT U DONT!! #warrenispartoftheproblem
Satisfactory
And continue to fill the swamp
If you want to do something more than just mouth off, try making lobbying in Washington and while the House and Senate are in, ILLEGAL.
We need to get out and vote 2018
Don't worry most of them are democrats.
While Dems pocket the cash from behind their backs.. and the American people pay the price for 'both'  of your party's malfeasance
In Dallas Texas. There Are Bad People's in Dallas Texas
Wonder what #GOP will say when #financial #institutions rape & #pillage the #American Consumer.
You speak of lobbyists & wall street fat cats but where the heck were you when 44 was given BILLIONS to Iran? We taxpayers pay 4 that!
It is a corrupt place. Vote them out
You didn't complain about crooked Hillary
Lets see whats in Your Wallet @SenWarren ! You're a Proven Liar!

#fauxcahantis
haven't you take money from corporate america?
We all know the Dem suck $ out of Wall Street during election. The flow continues. Dem suck the $. Dem just suck!
Is that like the Clinton foundation?
Disgraceful!!!

Wait, who's the Secretary of the Treasury?    
Opening the swamp for business
How much do you take annually from lobbyists?
Hillary certainly got rich of WS
News flash-Hillary isn't POTUS currently. And the swamp has more and more swamp monsters invited by current admin.
You take that DNA test yet?
It's so painfully obvious I don't get everyone doesn't see it.
Trump's daughter with the 1$ an hr workers for her clothing line?
Hope so need the bank stocks to go up  Xlf kre!!
where was your concern about foreign countries pouring money into Hillary's slush fund for Future favors
she dun no nuthin bout no money.
The tsunami of influence is coming. Stay vigilant #Resistance the fight for democracy is on. #TrumpRussia
So tRump is loading the swamp with more gators
Didn't like Comeys testimony huh?
You never even stood up for yourself
DO SOMETHING!!!
And you want a piece of it
#WrongChoiceAct And - DC allows lobbyists to exist. Get rid of them.
Have u ever had any meetings with lobbyists from any industry?
Do the universities you take so much money from that gauge students on tuition and drive up student loans also have lobbyists?
IF BOTH THE DNC & RNC ARE LIARS IT'S TIME TO HAVE A THIRD STRONG PARTY
This sounds pretty swampy.  @SpeakerRyan Why are you doing this?
I'm sure you've taken your share money from lobbyists. Don't be all high and mighty
You are so transparent #TermLimits #TermLimits #TermLimits
Be ready for the next financial meltdown.
Yup!  And it ends up in your pocket!  Do your job and stop with the finger pointing...you are as guilty as the rest of them!
Well, we're doomed. :(
Interesting that the Russian Ambassador only went to the Rep National Convention.
Cause Dems don't take money from banks, right? Who got more money from Wall Street and the big banks? Oh yeah, it was Hillary.
Chief strategist is former Goldman Sachs guy. His treasury sec was Goldman partner. Chief financial advisor is CURRENT CEO. See a pattern?
Difference between having former bankers work for you and you taking money and working for them.
It's worse. Instead of cash, they got paid with an insider job. They now help make the rules that regulate how they make money.
I don't know. I think paying someone who is a mediocre speaker on a good day, $400,000 for 20 minutes. Something not right there.
Tillerson got $180mil when he left Exxon, for whom he got huge drilling deal with Russia. Which they can't touch now with US sanctions .??
The swamp just got darker today!
This is why President Trump has banned  his cabinet members from becoming lobbyists. Trump is a good man.
You realize Bill Clinton signed repeal Glass/Steagal w/o line item veto & Dodd is best we got but no protection f/small banks.#FightBack
Correct. But enough breast-beating. The question is, what is to be / can be done?
Nope. They swarm and love Democrats like you
What the hell do you want us to do? Voter suppression, gerrymandering, rigged voting in Ohio. Where have YOU been? @alfranken
Well isn't that the pot calling the kettle black...
#Apologize for wasting millions of tax payer $$ on trump/russia BS!

Could have helped THOUSANDS of #Veterans and #Veteran families!
And when the economy crashes, taxpayers will bail out the banks again.
That's where we'll end up.
You're not seriously accusing anyone else of taking big money are you you're the queen of that b**** right behind Hillary
Ur just a working girl right. Well one worth 7 million dollars right?
Without lobbyist, I imagine the center would be a much larger group. Money as a polarizing agent is wrong.
They hiring?
It's not Hillary's pocket?
You should really get some of us "poors" in Kansas to talk publicly about life under the rule of these assholes. Food for thought.
it's a corrupt system
