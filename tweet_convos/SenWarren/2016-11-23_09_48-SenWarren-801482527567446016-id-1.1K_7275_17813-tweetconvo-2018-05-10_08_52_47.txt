They're not looking for a quick buck. I'm afraid it is a life long commitment ... from u the US of the USA .
All $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$.....$$$$$$$$$.....text this......
Who's gonna stop him, Senator?
Thank you, Ma'am!  We've been asking this all along!!! We didn't vote him in...we shouldnt be exposed to his #Autocratic Agenda!
all you do is tweet why don't you do the job you were elected to do?
hahaha but it's fine when the pres does it yeah?
The purpose of the presidency is not to glorify the president.
All that advice is perfect for you! Such hypocrisy!
@asheen that is why we soundly rejected Hillary Clinton.
Soundly? Read up sweetheart. Far fewer Americans voted for Trump than his opponent. Sorry, but no mandate.
Hillary lost for saying that the President works for the people?
shouldn't you be at #StandingRock with "your people", Pocahontas?
We will not sit this one out. We will press his conflicts at every turn.  No free passes for the Corrupter in Chief.
Now Grandma, you know that if you and your GOP Cong hacks had anything on Obama, they'd have tried 2 impeach...
I could use a good laugh. Tell me, what is this "plenty" you speak of?
Try spelling - it helps with communicating with intelligent people - it's "know", not "no".
Exactly. The President and Congress are supposed to work for us!!!
Keep on that Traitor tRump, Senator. Thank you!
Thank you for just being you.
when have you ever worked for me?
and yet...
why do all the leftist want to destroy the economy?
we demand to know how much SOROS & son give YOU @SenWarren - you work for US!! And what direction is he giving you in your secret meetings??
we need a recount in certain states see Jill Stein please. No wonder he was so smug
Well, I don't feel safe with this man in office.
Practice what you Preach Dearie!
Harvard is a private institution that has a billion-dollar endowment. State schools need tuition relief, not Harvard.
is she using her Political influence to extort the system Answer is yes it's called 
Pay to play
Like isn't even in office yet and is already engaging in quid pro quo politics. Were you dropped on your head as a child?
So much for #draintheswamp... Betsy Devos
Your Right! We are in total Agreement and that's why we Voted for TRUMP.
Yes, but he's already going against everything he said he was going to do, so what you liked about him he's not going to do.
Is not "draining the swamp" but using the swamp as his cabinet. I could go on, just watch the news, it's happening every day.
That IS specific. Well we will wait and see.But that is what he is saying NOW that he is going to  do, from his own mouth
@doctorow Please make him release his taxes now!
he did .... he emailed them to hilliar
He's working hard getting deals done as quickly as possible. Probably expectsbto be impeached. Meanwhile, Pence will do the job.
John Adams is rolling in his grave. @SenWarren @coy325ic
@stacy_friday to bad the oversight committees will be to busy helping him
YOU know how to help... #NOPALINVA. Ima #combatVet and #triggered that Palin may KILL #Vets in VA post. #NOPALINVA?
little reminder for people what we were founded on! And never go toe to toe on politics with a woman from where America started
Which world leader hasn't exploited their office to make a quick buck in recent history!? @Forthleft2
the American People are nervous that our new President is compromised. Disrespecting our intel is a disgrace. #TheResistance
he's not compromised he's OWNED!
@stacy_friday @PrincessBravato @SenWarren That is why we have no tax returns
Or to take countless vacations on taxpayer monies
that isvwhy wevdid nit ekect her.
Sen Warren, why isn't Congress SCREAMING for a delay of the electoral vote in light of russian interference?
how much money does he need? At some point aren't you rich enough?
why then did you let Obama do just that for 8 years... huh. Why? You love to scream with zero substance. Your embarrassing.
Foster Campbell agrees with this. Please support his election 12/10.
now appears that you already have —> http://goo.gl/j8MQLm 
Like the current POTUS is doing...and what the Clinton's have done to us for years...you POV is flawed maam! You are an elitist!!
Can we PLEASE find ways to impeach Him.
I'm just grateful that Marxist ideologues like you; Bernie & HRC will never succeed. ppl love bill of rights & freedom more.
or get paid $365,000 for teaching one course and getting preferential treatment by checking off the right box! Hypocrisy for 1
Like Bill Clinton and Hitllary?
believe me liawatha, Trump will do more in 30 days than Ogolferincheif has done in 8 years, take that to the bank.
the Democrats hold the least power in all public offices since 1928. Let that sink in your sanctimonious head.
Like the Clintons have done.
How does the President make a quick buck ?
Haha, he saved Carrier, all talk no walk
wait to see the end of the mandate some people will get much much richer
@FilthyDonald Expect little else. What a colossal mistake America had made. Corruption will be unprecedented (unpresidented)!
Oh #Faux Soon youll see
#America will become the land of Hope&Prosperity Again
GovtBabies&VictimStrat w/b just a bad memory
#MAGA
say’s the woman who charged 430k to teach one class at Harvard :(
like Obama did?
Yes Ma'am..
It only works when people vote, half the country couldn't be bothered.  Do they even know there was an election?
@xemu applies to last 4 Presidents..defo time to stop it!
YOUR TALKING ABOUT OBAMA RIGHT THE ONE WHO SAID LIVE FOR ILLEGALS TO VOTE YOU REALLY DO NEED A EVUATION FOR DISORDERS HELP IS OK
please help here and keep DT OUT
1/ Please read full thread and RT. As opposed 2 Trumps baseless claim of illegal voting, there is much evidence of voter suppression by GOP
@jsc1835 too late
please read this thread and help us
1/ Please read full thread and RT. As opposed 2 Trumps baseless claim of illegal voting, there is much evidence of voter suppression by GOP
@VividConfusion $30m was a cheap investment on DT's part. He'll make it back in first year extorting foreign governments.
And ripping off the AmTax Payers.  Millions for leases @ properties paid to HIM so his extended family has security.
Stop you crazy rants. Those of us that voted for Trump know you and you're party turned on us. Listen to your RANTS.
@CNN @ABC @CBS @NBC @BBCNews @HillaryClinton @MomsThoughts @AlecBaldwin @RT_com
PETITION ELECTORS!
fully agree Senator but it's not just that, he's manifestly, profoundly and dangerously unbalanced. existential threat to world
like HRC did with the State Dept????
yeah, that's why we elected Trump! Get over it, accept it move on or retire! So sick of your attacks & hateful actions!
@Dr_of_Nursing 
Republicans have no heart to stop trump
Dems must obstruct and filibuster
Not give an inch
You really should have explained that to Hillary, & the office of Secretary of State! Also to both houses!
The people will find their feet when Republicans eliminate the filibuster and start dismantling SS and Medicare.
like @HillaryClinton did at the State Department?
and it's proven with the pay to play that's what Hillary did. Think you even once called her out on it. Now you're a hypocrite
So why don't you try something for a change. My dad said if you can't say something nice say nothing at all.
STOP!! he isn't even in office yet or had time to do all these things but the law says that does not apply to prez or vp either!
I presume you are referring to President Obama?
Nothing like the Oligarchy we have with President Obama. Just look at the waste in our government now:  https://www.lankford.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Federal_Fumbles_2016.pdf …
hey, you are the  one  to tell what the prez should  be  doing
@BellaLibelle 64+ million of us understood that but 62 million not-so-brights & non-voters didn't get it & now it may be too late
Trump's disgusting remarks making fun of American Native Indian population & you totally inappropriate, but he tweets all lies.
a very good reason not to vote for @HillaryClinton who ran a pay for play scheme!  I agree with you on that!
@JohnCzer1 like the 10 before him ?
lol #Hypocrisy
Yes which is why I give thanks every day for keeping that criminal low life Liar Hillary out of the White House. Go Trump!
You mean like OBAMA does?
I think that very thing was reason #13 for why HRC lost the Presidential Race.
@liamack like obama ?
Election reform should be Democrats' #1 priority for 2016 unless they are prepared for Trump's stay to become permanent.
Like Obama?
@reddgirl56 agreed!!!
Precisely why we voted for Trump!
get ready to start your campaign for 2020!
And a SENATOR shouldn't LIE & be a COMPLETE FRAUD!
Native Americans slam @SenWarren as the FRAUD she is. 
so why should Hillary and the Clinton Foundation's ties (pay-for-play) occupy the Oval Office. Glad they won't be!
US senators should work for us-- & speak out to protect Native Americans/water protectors from violent corporate police #NoDAPL
thank god we didnt elect hillary clinton.. Am i right?!
Really? How about taking a stand at Standing Rock? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPySqqMNVNw …
@TheDailySchmuck umm hey senator I didn't see you complaining about Hillary using her office to get rich.
Tell that to President Obama. I predict that he will become very rich in the first 2 years after leaving office.
wow I'm sure Potus Mr. Obama appreciates you saying that about him
don't tell me you're not doing the exact same thing as a senator
That's why we must demand->amyloid β (Aβ) PET scan 2 see if there's Alzheimer's disease or frontotemporal dementia-B-4-EC votes!
SHOULD IT CLAIM TO BE NATIVE AMERICAN TO GET COLLEGE FUNDING?  You make yourself look like the fool you are!
Big Love . . .
Keep up the good work!
What???.... why would run for the office then??... "to serve the American people".....
Agreed. How I he lowed to get away with this?
What about Trump Org transactions with USA's GSA for properties in NYC?   He's making money on govt already.
exactly and that is why WE the People elected @realDonaldTrump as the president for us ALL. @HillaryClinton is DONE
STAND UP AGAINST #DAPL WRITE A LETTER TO OBAMA! Stop they violence you claim your Native but cant stand up for them
@SoniaKatiMota - It seems like so many of Trumps critics are all jumping on hill circus train.  I hope you won't be one. Resist.
Ask Haitians about the Clintons, Lizzy. They made millions of fast bucks and you stood silent.
Did you just learn that? or did you already know during Obamas weak a$$ help..
Hillary is a shyster, dummy.. 
shyster vs buffoon
oh you mean how hillary does pocahontas?????
you mean how you politicians  do it for your own personal gain???
Too bad, many people have no problem to have a President who will steal from them.
@DebraMessing Thank God we didn't vote #crookedhillary in right? RIGHT? #MAGA
, had YOU supported @SenSanders , as you should have, we might not be in such a pickle now! You're a traitor. #ElizabethLostMe
although I agree with your tweet I question its veracity bc the same was never said about HRC and the millions raised for the CF
@DebraMessing the Dems have been exploiting my tax dollars for years! Your point? #independants for the middle class
#resist
More like millions of quick bucks.
agreed get Obama out!! You can't be talking about Trump right? he isn't in office yet...or are you now a psychic?
Socialism numbs the brain
See Clinton Foundation
are you talking about Obama? does the same apply to the SOS...  you can't be referring to Trump since he isn't in yet
Shhhhhhhh......
@MAHAMOSA like...Standing Rock?
LOL why did you think I ran? Keep talking about race while I steal everything not nailed down. Too late to stop me! #thiefinchief
please follow this closely. Trump supporters pushing for registry and now some mention of internment camps. Alarmed!
Senators should work for the folks and stop exploiting the innocent. Every member of the Senate is a millionaire.
glad you're on my side and I hope you keep pushing the orange clouduntil the truth comes out!
hopefully next election both you and Jennifer Granholm will be inaugurated instead of the orange puffer fish.
@annenahm Uhm...not only should POTUS work for us....He is literally hired by us to do so. Trump loves his public servant status
what a stupid comment.
make sure you tell that to Hillary
he shouldn't. But he already is. So who's going to fix this? Who's going to hold him accountable?
you are sooo correct. Thank god @HillaryClinton didn't win or she'd have been a billionaire by the time she got out of office
Repubs have certainly showed what hypocrites they are! None of them standing up against trump and his conflicts/appointees!!
@rudnicker Thank you. Your spunk,your liveliness is heartening. You have enriched hope. You have cast despair aside.
With all due respect Senator, There's no Quick buck. He may have 4 years to scam businesses and taxpayers.
Why do we not get a stake in helping re-launch globally the tired Trump brand?

Is it legal for him to charge the secret service rent in HIS building when they are there to keep HIM safe? This seems so wrong.
Pls forgive our Whinny-@realDonaldTrump he suffers from Cognitive dissonance. he thinks he is in the Apprentice.
get 'em Senator!!! 
Does King Trump and his Trumpets know that?
I guess "you" doesn't include Native Americans. Treaty violations don't count, right? #StandWithStandingRock
@esneet4113 Thank you!
and what will you do in the senate to ensure @realDonaldTrump doesn't profit from the presidency?
where were you when Bill was renting the Lincoln bedroom???
but that is exactly what he's going to do..
@Kathy_Scheidel #RaiseSassyGirls
Do you mean like #Trump selling #Tumblers for $25? Leaving no stone unturned.
What legal action is being taken against this horrific fraud? People want to know. Tired of silence from top Dems #NOLEADERSHIP
The Clinton's have paved the way w/ CF - 
& you  @SenWarren endorsed CF practices.
@BeautyBind Please force him to comply or make his life hell if he doesn't!!
show me one President who hasn't done that!!!
@DebraMessing warren makes me sick, she's a cross between a frustrated nun and a bull dyke 
sort of like how the Clintons and Obama have done for their entire political career?
Have you read all these horrifying #conflictsofinterest ? http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/11/26/us/politics/donald-trump-international-business.html?referer= …
The US is now a division of Trump, Inc. He'll stiff the American people just like he does his contractors.
@capt_tripps66 you never heard of Bill Clinton I suppose
Nope
he made a few bucks exploiting the fact he was President
I don't think he exploited anything as the Prez-Elect or Prez. Nothing illegal after.
Monica disagrees...and exploiting something doesn't have to be illegal
I'm pretty sure she was at the age of consent. Could care less about people's sex lives. GOP "Exploited" them.
sex lives...literally  in the office? ...my tax money pays to clean that room
Hahahaha!!! C'mon man. Your reaching.
@caroljdavy U PHONY!! U sidew/Clinton, Wall St minion,won't reinstate G-S,war mongering grifter raking in $100s millions w/CGI!
If the Dems in congress just lie back and let this happen, you'll hear from us.
whoa!  So tell me who should Senators work for? Stop bitching and moaning and get something done for us in MA grandma!
Too bad you didn't feel this strongly when Obama was allowing Hillary to do the same thing with #ClintonFoundation #Hypocrite
Well DUH! Why do you think we voted TRUMP? Clinton sold out as SOS, we weren't letting her near Lincoln's bedroom again.
@S3nt13ntB31ng as he plays magnanimous + renounces the $400k prez salary  capitalizing on "good guy" points w/ "disenfranchised"
this coming from a non 'Native American' claiming benefits? Why are the Clinton's getting $10,000 taxpayer dollars rent for SS?!
will President trump's Tweets be screened so he won't embarrass us or put us in danger?
Well, it's a good thing HRC didn't get voted in as President then...
@samswey agreed.  For the current and future administration.  #NoDAPL
True; and it has been going on for quite a while. Curios, was that partly under your watch? I hope things change positively.
I sense a complete knowledge of the fuck up Trump by @SenWarren She just destroys Trump while doing other things.
let's see his taxes. Connections to Russia. Investigate and impeach!
@DebraMessing he will work for us. No one has for 8 years. So ready for Trump to #maga. It's been too long!
good luck with that.
is that not the point of all free government? Why are they all looked at to lead? They serve us...they need a reminder..a big one
@DebraMessing Great things happen, when people listen to EW!
@DebraMessing he should, but judging by PE trumps actions to date, he's not going to be that kind of President.
@DebraMessing  Thank you Senator for calling out the Clinton Foundation for what it was and is. Courage.
I feel very hopeful that you will put up a fight to make the elected potus 4 years in the White House pure hell
And citizen police should work for citizens that actually pay taxes instead of oil barons that dont. #NoDAPL
@biloxichoctaw tell that to @billclinton @HillaryClinton & @ChelseaClinton
No, I'll tell that to you.
I don't nd to hear, I'm not a power-hungry, money-grubbing whore that exploits the masses
A wise man once told me that whores have a strong moral code. Trump has none. Enjoy the ride, big boy.
you're claiming that @realDonaldTrump has no moral code yet you'd support the Clintons?  Lol
He has 0 moral code.But he has an extra dose of paranoia, a soupcon of meglamania, delusions of grandeur&a bad weave
Well the bad weave gives him an edge over the Clintons then
Evidently not. He had to cheat to beat the Clintons. #Wisconsin #votersuppression #Comey #Putin #KKK
