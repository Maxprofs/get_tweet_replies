Please start calling them "lie tanks" or "spin tanks" or "fib tanks" or "truthiness tanks" or anything equally honest. @SenWarren @nytimes
@AugustLady241 @nytimes This has been one of their worst kept secrets for decades: no surprise here!
and what about YOUR EVIL agenda? To destroy Christian faith!

no shit Liz, but you are on the wrong team, have not heard you speak against #TPP ...
The NYT article shows how Fedex used a think tank to push TTIP. Also:
thanks I should apologize I have been largely ignoring her..
The video is several months old, but a couple days ago she said TPP is dead in Congress. Poor POTUS
What were her exact words? Sen Franken said it was DOA *as written*. Maybe they'll add a comma and try to pass it.
You may be right. We have to be vigilant.
yep the "think tanks" of the big money puppetMasters. Blame the invisible demon NOT the #Sellout
I don't get why you're attacking Think Tanks. Hillary  is in bed with them.
Ny time. They have not written a far piece about republicans since...,, NEVET
I did and I wonder why Congress kept inviting @AEI Peter Wallison & Ed Pinto when their agenda was so obvy #GSEKillSquad
good book on research being co-opted for corporates to muddy the science on tobacco and climate change "Merchants of Doubt"
Sounds a lot like how the Clinton Foundation operates. Hmmm seems you may be hypocritical!!!
#Demexit. #ExposeHillary.
Same thing is going on in science/Pharma/academic research. Fake "journals" and "institutes" that publish garbage.
Don't forget the 2 million astroturf sites for curative info...
I like to call them "Stink Tanks"
That was known, revealed in 60s by G. William Domhoff in "Who Rules America/" NOT news at all.
Hillary did this? Or was it you? Cuz you're not too bright. Weak.
nytimes? Then it must be true. No bias there
tell your senior citizen best friend Clinton! Two old women lying to get ahead! We are not as stupid as your generation
you actually want us to believe this is not done for corporate interests that have nothing to do with people's interest
GEEZ YOU AND HRC PUSH YOUR INTEREST ON A DAILY BASIS SO YOU HAVE NO ROOM TO TALK
#BreakingNews Terrorist's Father's endorsement of @HillaryClinton #Fact does the Democratic party support Terrorism?
@girlziplocked @nytimes are you back now, Senator? Was it all just a bad dream? had nightmare that you endorsed 1 of most corrupt
Democrat regs&taxes are favorable to Corporations,International Business&Wall Street,not small business&entrepenuers.
#Trump visited us lefties on #capecod yesterday +was met with 100s of protesters in #Osterville. Can u go to Ptown Aug 21st?
Strange how conveniently the word "often" has been left out of your tweet. Innocent until proven guilty please.
what did she give you to switch sides?  A bottle of whiskey?  Nobody cares, make smoke signals elsewhere
When a person doesn't have the courage of their convictions I lose respect & move on.
corporate executives write policy. That's why regulations usually help big business, and limit competition.
Koch is the worst they find institutes to come on pundit shows and lie.... Soc security bankrupt
I'm sorry.You have lost all credibility to most #BernieSanders supporters.I hope u can earn our trust back #JillNotHill
@SenWarren @nytimes
Yeah you know all about this hormone hurricane.
I was with you, until you left me... #DemExit
Does it mention the exorbitant and disproportionate $$$ they pay for speeches?
wow Ms Warren u must be kidding Co do things to make themselves look good U are a genius I thought u were just a drunken Indian
So why do you support Ed Reforms? Gates does the same thing?
.@SenWarren reform = privatization, inaccurate accountability, social darwinism, influence peddling, defunded public, war on Ts @carolburris
They are Hiding behind Think Tanks and This Burns me up. We need to make New Laws once our Democrats get in.
When We start correcting some of These Shoddy Fronts+Make things Better for The American People They will love Democrats
They will stay Blue and will not want to go Red Again!  This Should be against The Laws.
no worries, I'm sure Shillary will tell them to "cut it out".  Once you endorsed that corporate lap dog u lost all cred
Nah!  I'm waiting on their story on Fake Indians in the US Senate.......
Imagine if #Trumpsparency took over.
WTF needs to read about this? Been done since Roman times... Accept it as process and move on.
@YoniFreedhoff @nytimes kinda hypocritical given Senator recd grants at Univ and funding for her campaigns.
#sellout
Think tanks founded to support business interests. Heritage started in response to Powell Memo in 1973. No mystery here.
both sides
How can you let trump off hook
He's close to meltdown
can you tell Jill Stein to go away she's a communist traitor
and often pushing incomplete economic narratives that fail to acknowledge societal costs due to monopolistic practices
who needs an article when we have #CrookedHillary the queen of personal enrichment for government favors, who I endorsed
Follow the money.
Think Tank means they are figuring a way to make a lie digestible not that they are looking for real answers.
your adgendas Warren...you and Hillary and Obama & the Dems  @nytimes
You want us to read an article from the NY TIMES? The rag of journalism. The most untrustworthy so called newspaper. No!
Govt donates and give grants to Universities to push whose interests?
like Open Society Foundations?
pocahontas is goofy
Sen Warren pls advocate for the public re the FCC ignoring Toxicology reports showing dna damage from wireless fields
millions already hurt, 4 and 5G a nightmare health issue-no child should ever use a cell phone or tablet accd to Doctors
Have you read Dark Money by Jane Mayer?
this is not news. You should always ask who funds research. I always do.
pocohontas laughs. hillary cackles.
the congress has allowed this to happen. Repubs and dems are guilty of policies that hurt americans
that is why I am going Green. #Jill2016
@itzme2 Trump has already shown everyone just how crooked "businessmen" can be. Many eyes have been opened.
Isn't this the same point anti man caused climate change groups say? No raw data. Climate change is real.
Surprised, really?
Are these the tanks @HillaryClinton gets her awful ideas from? #NeverHillary
@VernaPolitics @nytimes Oh what a pain it is to live in a free country with a free market.
@randyprine @nytimes Yes like the ACA was an Heritage Foundation idea. Now Obama care is terrible.
.@SenWarren @nytimes Great pc. Now pls do one on Koch bros phony academic centers:

keep at it Senator.
I read that and wish the #nytimes would do analysis of a lot more #thinktanks to see which ones are corrupted by money.
sure would like to see those Trump tax returns! #TrumpTaxReturns
can't.  I have too many subscriptions already which concludes me to say I'm not subscribing to the NYTIMES.
Brookings promotes brands like $JPM $66 whose $15.5M contribution is their largest private donation in history.
tell it to Tonto!!
..so what?  Put all opinions and opinion makers out of business?  Thenvwhat?
you must not actually like the Clintons then
Oh,you mean GOVERNMENT RESEARCH GRANTS,that PROMOTE global warming&all the OTHER CRAP the Globalists&special interests want.MAGA
Hillary Clinton, often referred to as the lesser of two evils, should read this, SAD!
Elizabeth, Elizabeth....really?  No kidding?  The Liberal Party is also a large  business pushing it's own interest
add this: @HillaryClinton fundraises from #DC think tanks, K st lobbyists, Wall St, non-profits, law firms. #Tatiana
Tick-tock!!! Cicada 3301 LEAK: #Huma #Hillary videos for Saudi Royals https://youtu.be/lqf1EXD0_nM 
@Bernlennials @People4Bernie @Bill_Cimbrelo @RBReich @rosariodawson Great! Now watch CLINTON CASH! Then choice it's easy
folllow the money.. it's a no brainer
Helloooo is anyone home in Warrenland? It's an insult to our intelligence that she keeps masquerading as a progressive.
I think academic papers should also have to list all funding and donors by name b/c we know big corp $ is there too.
Great contribution, Senator. What's the solution? Take away tax-exemption? Would disclosure of donors be at all helpful?
Where are the democratic think tanks?
The story is a collaboration between @nytimes and Massachusetts-based @TheEye_NECIR
Is this where the "OMG WE NEED MORE STEM WORKERS!!" idiocy comes from. Because we don't. -signed, laid off from STEM
Yes. Bingo. #randcorp
Goofy wakes up!
@FoxNews Pay attention Senator Warren these are Clinton's Cronies! Your platform is based on lies deception! So Clinton!
Networks use them as part of their phoney balancing act. Also perpetrate the illusion that Hillary is "dishonest."
Tell me how to tax a Corp? Don't they just to pass it on to the consumer! DUH!!!
can't get past all the WALL ST donations to Hillary & Dems The EU all about big money also Dems support EU @bellatrova @nytimes
reminds me of how communist radicals get paid $300,000 to teach one university course

@SenWarren @nytimes
@pRESIDENT_ALIEN @FLMENFORTRUMP @SenWarren @nytimes
How do you plan to fight corporate interests w/HRC as your president?
Says the Senator who supports Wall Street's favorite candidate @Honest_Hillary !
Hillary supports the council on foreign relations. Same thing.
Trump has his staff in Trump Tower using everything Trump so all the $ comes back to him! Lie/Rip Off!!
@SenWarren @nytimes
Here is a trump "not a hero"  the supporters of trump is the GOP https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLaNIZEHpu8 … how can gop justify support?
