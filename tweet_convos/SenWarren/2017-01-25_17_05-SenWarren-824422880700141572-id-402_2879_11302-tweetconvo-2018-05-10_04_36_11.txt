He is dangerously unstable. He needs psychiatric intervention,  and should be considered unfit to serve.
He is so obviously crazy it bothers me that he gets away with so much without being challenged more by sane people watching.
2. Fantasy conspiracies. In other words, he can not distinguish between reality and fantasy. So, he is either insane,
or a pathological lying con man, which also signals serious mental health issues.
Why do you have such a problem with that particular black man? Are you racist?
my only issue w ben is he's admitted in his hearing that he'll work 4 prez personal interests aka corruption
all of us need to let our representatives know we care #weoutnumbertrumpsupporters
Please don't allow my tax dollars to go to his stupid wall.
. Unfortunately, they'll prob go up to allow for the tax cuts 4 the rich. See vlogbrothers video
@KevinDarryl and yet your supporting his HUD NOMINATED POS. 
Sounds hypocritical. Lost my support
They are Losing My Support as Well!
SO WILL  BEN CARSON. And YOU voted for him. 
Under. Statement. @SenWarren @Solutioneer72
Ten trillion to build a wall vs one hundred and twenty trillion in welfare and freebees every year, do the math.
paying for THIS women's abortions is NOT a waste of taxpayers money? She needs TO GET A JOB and pay for her own
MA legislature gets an $18 million a year pay increase this last week...where's that money come from? TAXPAYERS
so Elizabeth warren gets a raise so she and her girls can walk around Boston with vagina hats on... DISGRACE!
Trump's there. Now DO SOMETHING!!! We know he's a nut job, but we expected better of you. Get with it.
@LindaCollins11 @realDonaldTrump try Napoleon complex projects
And have leftist actions ever wasted any tax dollars? Look in the mirror if you can stomach it.
Why did you vote to approve Ben Carson?
WE have been wasting dollars for many decades on government corrupt projects, illegal aliens, useless congress
'Pet projects'?  ideology, goals, mission statement of neo-nazis and kkk - those are the pet projects
your resistence will cost you more votes in the future
Proof? Examples?
.@SenWarren Too bad you haven't rejected his proposed cabinet members, then.
Look if just one person votes no, what to prove a point that won't matter? She still has to work w/ the trolls
To "pick your battles" you have to assume that the other side is going to ALLOW you that choice. What indicates that GOP will?
Nothing but as I said,1 vote wouldn't even prove a point, she has to still work with them. Hence pick choose battles
As I said: the Dems need to form the same kind of cohesive oppositional voting block that the R's used for 8 years.
@toshea66 @realDonaldTrump With all due respect, if u don't yank him out-tax payer dollars will seem irrelevant to # of deaths.
YOU ARE THE WASTEFUL ADDITION TO THE SOCIALIST AGENDA.  LOOK IN THE MIRROR..WHO IS THE UGLIEST PERSON OF ALL?
Just a reminder, Obama ran the debt up ten trillion dollars and we never heard a peep out of you about it.
@LindaCollins11 @realDonaldTrump So why did u vote for one of T'Rumps nominees.Didn't you get the message from the Women's March?
Ba ha ha ha...the waste of the last 8 years taught you Dimms NOTHING!
is the biggest single threat America has faced in a long time, maybe ever. And yet many Dems are silent.
not all. Have u seen the senate cabinet hearings & #Indivisible  protests @ reps offices?
Organize resistance in Congress to "Investigation."  Bogus. How much will it cost?  Tax payers won't pay for T's vanity.
#Veterans If the GOP had something better than the Affordable Care Act, they wouldn't have to sabotage the Affordable Care Act
& his kids secret companies will "win" the contracts like he did the elections, by foolish & regretful decisions
As opposed to welfare, ebt, etc... Stop drinking the firewater...
@MAHAMOSA @realDonaldTrump Please Senator Warren say NO to DEVOS our children deserve a real educator, they are the futures
@ourburninghouse No tax payer alive would willingly pay for a wall. Berlin? Hello walls don't work!
lol. So now Warren is against frivolous spending. Okay.
tell Texas build your own wall. The majority of people don't want there taxes to pay for it
#TrumpsWalmartTax
Of course. So how are you all going to stop this attack on decency
take military budget & gut it 80%. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain by helping #farmers #trades #schools #healthcare #vets
U and the other democrats wasted a LOT of tax payer money helping illegals..these criminals DONT BELONG here!!!
Oh you're worried about WASTE and FRAUD now??After U  lied about being Native American so you could get FREE ed.
ssdwwss
so not only do you want me to pay for these illegal immigrants.. You want me to pay for your 45k raise..
@msreese59 @realDonaldTrump When is it ever right to appt. someone to a job who doesn't have the right resume for the work?
How about a good ole Impeachment, follow by a
what was waste of money is what Obama send to Palestinians 221M
@Hapjamlaw @realDonaldTrump It's NOT HIS $$.  It's the taxpayers of which HE IS NOT ONE!
#make him use that $$for infrastructure projects in Midwest when internet can drive or fly in jobs follow
You mean like $1.5 billion to Iran and $220 million to Palestinians?
@GreekGoddessATL @realDonaldTrump your party wasted 9 Trillion that didn't benefit USA!watch a true leader fix our country #MAGA
Including the many Ben Carson now has the opportunity to blow billions on...
like dancing shoes for cats, and doggy drones.  Can you be more specific or do you prefer sweeping generalities?
At least his construction friends can live the high life for a while
Thank God for a voice of reason in the tidal wave of un-American ideals being put forth by the president.
@SaraRadle @realDonaldTrump how upset are you that it isn't the 60s? Go rob the poor somewhere else, lady
@SaraRadle @realDonaldTrump at least you political "reporters" will still get paid, isn't that the point of this tweet, sweetie
We have no say on spending money on a wall? How about health care for elderly and poor
A socialist who is finally worried about tax dollars????
Then why are you voting for all his cabinet noms.?
It will be known in history as Donald the Denier presidency.
the president appears emotionally and psychologically unstable. God save the USA.
STOP voting for his nominations and fight for us!!
Billions for a wall. Taking property to do it. Ugh!
do something about it
The democratic people are hoping our democratic representative can stop this CROOKED JACKASS TRUMP.
exactly he doesn't care. What's he doing for the tornado victims? Didn't have any semi of Play-Doh to hand out?
He is stuck in an #augmentedreality, surrounded by #alternativefacts! We are doomed. 
So will Ben Carson's!
Like Ben Carson using HUD money to build pyramids for grain storage?
for sure. But you're voting YES to confirm Ben Carson. How sad. Revolt or don't. Pick one.
his actions will secure our border which is something democrats never planned to do so get used to it
it never fails to amaze how intolerant all of you all inclusive tolerant progressives are
like making sure that people who apply for grants actually deserve them?
he's such a punk
How's he going to build is wall if he deports the immigrant labor?
if you want to help the American people cut your pay and use the same health insurance the rest of must have to keep the cost dn
there was just a story last week about so much money wasted on stupid pet projects? God you make me sick! Liar
what about the Millions of dollars wasted on Obama's watch? Hypocrites
I'm patiently waiting for the Dems to stop this at every turn....not enough numbers to stop Trump in his tracks #trumptakesover
;he'll do whatever to benefit himself & family.where's his tax returns?
you Pocahontas are the problem we are  waiting tax payer dollars having you in the Senate.....DB
says fight fire w fire stop playing nice w GOP #minorityPresident
You're kidding right, what about the millions the obama's spent on their vacations we paid for?
use the courts to stop Trump, just like the GOP use the court to try to stop President Obama's Executive.Actions. #UseTheCourts
good to see you so vocal on Twitter, but how about elected Democrat band together and are vocal in DC #resist #beheardbyall
VOTE AGAINST HIS NOMINEES!!!! @SenWarren @papacarl1956 @realDonaldTrump
Does anyone agree that the regression of the USA is now in motion. SAD
I agree Sen Warren;  the wall will cost 12 to  15 billion dollars, that could provide health care for Americans
;On Warren's watch, Dems doubled the debt to $20 Trillion, with nothing to show for it. Total fiscal incompetence
You are losing the faith of your supporters by voting to back the Trump agenda and his unqualified nominees.
Do you mean the Trump Wall.Trump said it would be http://beautiful.Jobs  @SenWarren Make America Great Again!!!
Like Dems irresponsible & misguided #FATCA legislation? Like US immoral tax'n based citizenship Dems support?
.@wisecroneknows @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump the #Democrats sure know how to kiss up to their #compliance industry donors. Ka-Ching! #FATCA
Block him at every turn.
Elizabeth Warren is an idiot
waste tax dollars ???? Are you kidding??? The last 8 years have been a waste of tax dollars
and so are you
A lot of money to spend on symbolism! #NorthSideOfTrumpWallMadeOfMirrors #TrumpHasNarcissisticPersonalityDisord
Like Obama's one trillion dollar shovel ready project that created 12 jobs?  You are so hypocritical.
You don't know that you're speculating on that. @BostonGlobe @masslivenews Don't Reelect
WTF does he care? He DOESN'T PAY TAXES!  BTW where are his tax returns?  That's one long ass audit! #lyingTrump
No you are Wrong. The ppl have tolerated that for 8 long grueling years. It's over.
Like illegal Imigration?
Kinda like what the last guy did for 8 years. #givingdopesavoice #crazyladyprobs #lyingliz
Will this be Trump's "never ending hearings" of the Benghazi waste of taxpayer dollars?
he is wasting tax $ on the wall, Could be helping out Homeless Vets, Planned parenthood and more
Like Holder & Obama running guns to Mexican gangs to undermine gun rights in US? @realDonaldTrump
he doesn't care
this man is insane so mentally unstable he being allowed to walk around w nuclear codes!!
Thank you. I'm sad & scared that republicans aren't fighting back. Poor djt's ego is hurt & we r paying the bill
https://soundcloud.com/prince-augustine/jehovah-omegamasterd … free BIAFRA
Which actions? Like forcing bosses to keep jobs in America?
When will u make peace with the Sioux nation?
@PatriciaRGilbr1 @realDonaldTrump he will do anything at any cost for his ego it's absolutely disgusting #unfit #ImpeachTrump
meanwhile failing infrastructure will be put on backburner once again.
That sounds just like you and your ilk! Y'all beasties now?
#thuglife
And on his narcesistic paranoid delusions.  More waste down rabbit holes.
I'm still having a hard time with your Ben Carson approval
I can tell u were in academia u blow alot of bs
@AngelaKrebs444 @realDonaldTrump Ms. Warren, he has to be stopped as he is going to use this for voter suppression. HE WILL LIE
it will actually save ur country billions. Guess what? The far left is OVER. Ur fading so fast. Race cards, scare tactics, OVER
bring back the Military draft clean up the streets. Get these young people a purpose in life. No job, then bye!
you're a waste, resign now!
and as we all know, he's not a taxpayer.
It's far worse, @SenWarren: the fraud investigation is a precursor 2 police state; mandatory registration is next.
#TheResistance
@farandwee
Just like Ben Carson. Come on Sen Warren, this isn't politics as usual.
We are not going to pay for the F.. wall. It is waste of money
Please stand up for us and vote no to Session and Devos
then reject his cabinet members.
I trust you!!
no building a ridiculous wall with my tax dollars! Spend your own $$$ @realDonaldTrump. Senator Warren, keep telling the truth!
Merrick Garland fiasco means Dems should vote no on ALL TRUMP PICKS.  PLEASE.  Lifelong ties to S. Yarmouth, MA.
so says the queen of pet political projects.  Typical tax and spend dem philosophy
he wants to erase Obama's legacy. If Americans are not in a more secure place when he leaves it'll reinforce it
republicans want to turn nation into Kansas that's irresponsible & misguided. But that will be Trumps legacy.
#truth! We need your help!
you're wrong, that's what YOUR party does
Esp. that RIDICULOUS wall! do NOT waste a single dime of our tax $ (that trump has never paid) on that crap!
trump wants a wall? he can pay for it himself with his "billions", mr.(pathetic) tax dodger.
Mexico ain't paying for it. #FuckTheWall; in case you hadn't heard.
correction: #FuckingWall
I thought @POTUS froze all the EPA Grants to pet projects?
is there nothing that can be done senator about someone who is mentally unfit
- Nag, nag nag.
is out of control is there anything that can be done?
u waist our tax $ on illegals and lazy Americans that don't want to work bc they know gov't will give free $$
stand up for us!
Please motivate Congress to stand against him! We need checks and balances.
What are we doing for the people in Southern Disaster area?
Couldn't agree w/ you more Senator Warren!
@JackSmartWrites @realDonaldTrump.  Tump is saving. This country something nobody else has been able to do
buddy are you ok? Sending u a virtual hug bro
Nothing wastes tax payer dollars more than a corrupt politician...and you would have a masters degree...
Going to fix our finances... NOT.  Please keep fighting.
@skyclad_dancer Very disappointed you voted for Carson. He is very unqualified.
.@SenWarren Why would you confirm Ben Carson? He is unqualified, addled & likely an opium addict. Women didn't march for this.
tough shit Trump is in charge now And Dems have no chance of stopping anything he does!!! GO TRUMP!!!
Wrong! No more Soros Globalist agendas and watching his anarchist groups closely. Your boss Soros is a Nazi!
Keep an account of all the money he wastes. It will come in useful.
Kinda like paying a professor $400,000 to teach 1 class?
When have you ever cared about tax dollars being wasted? 
Endorsing the law on immigration is the law
How's that?  You seem to make a lot of inflammatory and unsubstantiated statements.  Do tell
like Solyndra?
YOU, YOUR PARTY AND OBAMA HAVE ROBBED THE MIDDLE CLASS FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS WHERE DO YOU GET OF ?LIES!
the sad part of this is: so-called, self-professed conservatives are all in. Punish poor people! Screw the cost!
like the $500million Obama gave to Solyndra? Which is now bankrupt BTW!
Would be nice if taxpayers could have option 2 rank & direct where they want our tax $ 2 fund. Truly democratic.
why people don't see the way you see?
And what are Democrats going to do about it? Just how much can he do without it going through the budget process?
I think he's doing GREAT!
He sure can't do worse than OBAMA/CLINTON! Or..YOU
he is an empty vessel being filled by the GOP.
just like that bullshit raise you voted for today
like paying you..that's is a total waste..get a life
-I still don't get why Democrats are sitting on their asses, & hear nothing of them blocking or obstructing Trump
and you would know about that
so will his cabinet members. Why didn't you vote no on ALL OF THEM
He's a loony. History shows us walls are just there to climb over, dig under, or go around.
@MSignorile @joyannreid and sadly, Sen. how many of his pets did u confirm?
Where is the outrage about the Executive orders from Trump from the Democratic party...WHERE IS IT!!!
Blech. Urophilia and Bestiality. Sick dude.
he's an angry little child with a temper. Some Hollywood loser coming to run a country.
I have read & attempted 2 understand all of ur tweets this eve. Ty 4 building the strongest Rep party ever. cc @realDonaldTrump
yay like Obama sending millions of dollars as you going out the back door right
stop being polite! call a liar a liar, a fraud a fraud. Orange fraud cannot be treated as legit or sane. IS NOT
you tell them congress people to get a spine!
- @realDonaldTrump does not have pet political projects as he is not a politician. Shift your thinking, his ego drives him.
how much of his cabinet do you think you will vote yes on with the second choice argument???
just like funding abortions  in other countries or obama trying to give a huge payment before he left
