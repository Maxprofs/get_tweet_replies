Yes! Fiduciaries protect investors. The GOP seems to care about Wall Street more than investors.
Hilary Clinton  is Wall streets puppet. She needs to go.
this has nothing to do with Hillary.Stop deflecting & face the facts; GOP doesn't care about investors
I'm not, I just want the entire truth out there,both parties are in the pocket of special interest
the issue at hand is about the fiduciary rule & how the GOP doesn't want to protect investors.
The nice native american is talking about Wall Street, stop deflecting I am on point.
no, ur not. Why would you support overriding the fiduciary rule??
The conflict of interest rule? I dont have an opinion on it.
What a deplorable sellout you turned out to be. @SenWarren @BroMark13 @HouseDemocrats
what's wrong with trying to fix this? :https://youtu.be/5NOvbdgnwc8

#FunnyHow
I Voted for Donald Trump. So Why Am I in Elizabeth Warren’s Trump-Bashing Video? http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/06/elizabeth-warren-donald-trump-video-move-on-213987 …

Worth reading.
You & your partner are the problem!
coming from a phony Indian who shook down Harvard $400k is rich.
..Men will straighten out the mess women like Hillary have made. It's truly a Mans world!
How ds Hillary fail all
Hillary represents Wall Street.
You and Warren are sick people with a criminal leader who will set terrible example for our kids!
But you aligned yourself with someone whom epitomizes doing their dirty work. Make up UR mind, Senator
The @HouseDemocrats may not have been sent to do their dirty work. Thats been @HillaryClinton 's job & she's paid well 4 it #tcot
wow wall Street armies?  And you've endorsed the Wall streets General Hillary. #Hypocrite
Sellout #NeverHillary
You are a part of Wall St's armies and backed by their lobbyists. You are certainly backing corrupt Hillary.
Bashing Trump with money from Wall Street doesn't take courage. Criticising Hillary Clinton for taking them does.
lol. Says the person backing Hillary and her high dollar wall street speeches. Seriously, just stop.
Better tell that to your mentor Hillary. That's right u got rich committing fraud to get ahead of real minorities
Yet you endorsed Wall Streets greatest advocate Hillary! You are the 1%!
