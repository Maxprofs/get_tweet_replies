We need to fund stuff like this and education, not the muthereffin wall!
People don't want the war because they need the drugs to come over. Cartel pay Warren to fight the war Hollywood junkie going crazy

Therefore, according...
To every eighth grade teacher ever, you proooooobably can't trust it

Yes, there is division within the Democratic Party. Your point?
How about build the wall and stop the doctors and pain clinics! Band aid, making middle class pay for someone else's addiction! F em and U
No post about how you wanna stay at war for life?

She talks about everything but never completes anything.  She is a showboat
#addiction does not have to be a life sentence with appropriate mental health and medical treatment. Let's fight for effective #treatment!
Number one factor to opioid crisis is radical extremist democrat policies putting millions of American in economic prison @realDonaldTrump
Medical Cannabis can lower Opioid Overdose Rates by up to 50.9% and average 24.8%:

Depend on us to don't you think so 
Well pochahontas, just BAN ALL OPIOIDS in your state!! No Drugs No problem!! It's not that hard of a problem to fix!!!
Here's innovative PREVENTION- Opioids don't work for chronic pain. PHYSICIANS, STOP PRESCRIBING THEM! & TAKING $$$ FROM PHARM COMPANIES!
Why don't we take that 40,000 it takes to incarcerate someone in prison for being an addict and use it to get them treatment instead
YES, it seems that the for-profit prison system has a more effective lobby than the for-people treatment system.
IN NEED THANKS FOR BE AWARE OF DOES PEOPLES A BATTELS I'M workaholic  nathing alse  . Hope you success senator warren 
Build the wall and have better border security. Stop the flow of drugs coming in from China and Mexico.
Decriminalize all drugs. Step one. All other talk is just posturing
Why don't you do what libs do with everything else, legalize and tax it to raise revenue that you will spend faster than you get it.

Thanks senator for helping people I need .you have warm heart 
I thank you @SenWarren for your constant work to help all Americans in so Many ways, & You so it W/out any Golfing breaks! You Rule Ma'am
Careful America citizens. They are working with pharmaceutical companies. It is ALL ABOUT THE MONEY NOT THE PEOPLE.Democratic's are corrupt
Rehab is bullshit. It takes willpower and you have to want to change. This is just a liberal money grab that will raise the price of meds.
Hey Squaw why don't you give the program some of your money?
Let Massachusetts taxpayers pay the bill!
How sad and how sick. Anger because their choice did not win People are spreading such hate towards our President and his supporters.
And how thin do you think they'll be stretched under universal health care that you keep peddling becomes reality? Socialism doesn't work!!

Phony
Legalize marijuana.
Met with...Talk with...Done nothing.
As long as these people running the government let Pharma lobbyists decide policies, nothing will happen.

How about we #BuildThatWall to stem the influx of drugs and human trafficking into the country, na that's #POTUS idea let's bash it Instead
If you were serious about this issue, you would be demanding a border wall and enforcement.
Thank you for your work. I'm in California. My son has been sober for almost five years. Anything you do helps, as a mom, I appreciate it.
Don't do drugs Pocahontas!!
The country will go broke taking care of the crack heads.
PHARMA has DEEP POCKETS - Tgey Organize & Fund to prevent the inevitable State AG & Class Action?!
Build the wall.  Halting drugs flowing from Mexico would be the best "treatment" to cure this epidemic.
@rex_rexchapman Indian outlaw half Cherokee,  well, we know the rest.
Let's give ALL of our money to the drug addicts. They deserve it. Poor dears
Your right we need to cut the flow of drugs #BuildTheWall
Citizens should flood not with water but comments of concerns to @realDonaldTrump We need to improve him if staying in office
Do u really think he gives a damn?? No, he doesnt! Hes all talk & we all know how much of a hipocrit & liar he is, since day 1. Pathetic
I agree with you but something has to be triggered within him to place him in a corrective course
So we pray sir, sooner or later something has 2 happen.
No one's talking about the dark web as a source of illegal drugs. They're even on regular old websites (China).
#67stopthebullshit
Death penalty for dealers in opioids crack heroin meth crocodile fentanol cocaine et a. Marujuana legal. Problem solved
The manufacture of these opiates that Floridians smoke are also the same manufactures who create the testing agent.
what % of opioid deaths are from Rx given out by Drs??  wth is going on??  how many in govt are now addicted but refuse to accept that??
in Florida all the junkies smoke a combination of meth opiate synthetic cocaine & they think its cocaine...
maybe the provider & dr that write the scripts should be funding these clinics.. time for big pharma to pay up
So stop supporting illegal aliens and use that money to help opioid addicted instead but you won't
All talk
No action
Without Healthcare, treatment is only a dream. People R screwed. Drug COs get richer
As long as the supply of drugs goes unregulated stretching will continue. Big Pharma need to help pay 4 treatment like Cigg Cos
Why don't you do something about this Senator? Harm reduction & safe injection sites are NOT the solution. http://salem-news.com/articles/september112017/purdue-pharma-killer-children-msp.php …
Bla, bla, bla.
Free drugs to the addics.
No building nessary.
Cheep high.
Then let them die.
Is opioid treatment in MediCare for All?
@lettyazar
Maybe it's time that you quit resting the POTUS, and come up with solutions to help!
Please run in 2020. You'd make an incredible first female POTUS, and I'd love to have the chance vote for you in my first election of age.
Aren't we all!!
Russia/Afghanistan/Taliban/Opium/Heroin Smuggling/US ports/Russian mob/money laundering/American real estate.
Maybe you need their care.
What do they do in the tribe?
Squaw Running Mouth does nothing but run her mouth! No ideas, just Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
The biggest drug dealers live in your neighborhood. You create these drug help you centers because there is big money to be make. Get yo 
So why did Obama have Billions $ left over he didn't spend on Opioid treatment and addiction. You must have been sleeping at the wheel.
Hey Larry? I think YOU were asleep at the wheel. This took 5 seconds on Google: https://www.drugrehab.com/2016/12/09/senate-approves-21st-century-cures-and-opioid-funding/ …

Was it all spent??????
Yes, HHS issued the grants. He signed the act: https://www.drugrehab.com/2016/12/09/senate-approves-21st-century-cures-and-opioid-funding/ …
In contrast, here's Trump: http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/the-best-part-of-trumps-budget-was-a-sham.html …
Just Google.
Hard to figure why we must pay for those who are suicidal, weak and foolish.
That moving the goalposts, because you mouthed off and were factually, totally wrong, and I caught it.
Weren't good in English, I see.
Of course they are. If you don't want to quit, you won't. My son is an addict. Talk about a futile fight. We need the wall!
Better start printing money. Texas, Florida r in serious life threatening need of money too. By the way, most Americans r strapped for 
They sure do stretch it too thin! All we are doing is throwing money down the drain! Personally have spent $$$ trying to save the children
If you want to scare yourself Senator visit New Bedford. The opioid epidemic is staggering and crippling our youth. HELP!!!

Who governs Big Parma -if Duty of care is public responsibility/duty/law http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2017/07/27/opioid-prescriptions-depression-anxiety.aspx?utm_source=twitter.com&utm_medium=referral&ut … …  USA has opiate crisis. @dutyholder care
weather modification has a patent, It is illegal to patent nature. Do No harm is the principle law and the reason we are jailed for murder.
So the gov't makes $ by importing the drugs from Afghanistan, then charge us to treat the problem they created. Great business model!
duty of care is supreme law. The duty holder is the Gov - The Gov represents law - who governs Big Pharma when health is a public duty. ?
Word on the street is that you are gone when you are up for re-election. You are not a champion of the people, just your Wash life style.
I'm in Ohio lost 2 nephew's we're losing a whole generation of young men&Women here the thing they need treatment then jail
Good
What isn't stretched too thin. The whole country and the people in it are stretched to thin "OH" except the politicians
Thanks for your work! We need to solve the opioid crisis.
So how do you plan to get all these extra dollars? Taxing the people that are smart enough not to become addicts?
When money is what truly matters, people will always be secondary. #ImLessValuableThanPaper
Perhaps you could write a check, instead of constantly trying to convince the taxpayers they need to do more
Pocahontas heep big a-hole speak with fork tongue
So which is it? Too thin or affordable??
Wasn't Donny supposed to fix all this, or Jared? What happened @realDonaldTrump. Where is the help u promised all these ppl? All BS as usual
We dont care why should you
Sitting squaw   Where were you before.  At the wine and cheese shop.  Phony
Legalize marijuana at the federal level. Problem solved. Easy.
Steve buddy. We don't need anymore stoned idiots running around. Get a grip.  You will after you settle down
alcohol does more damage 2 the individual & society than cannabis. a herb in its natural state.  eating is best, no lung damage that way.
So young people walking around stoned all day. At work?  At school. The  future for them is bleak. Sorry
cannabis dried naturally or very low temperature=negligible THC.  you dont get high.  helps cope w/pain & other health issues=medicinal use.

Watch: @LauraLoomer asks #HillaryClinton and #HumaAbedin  the right questions. #MAGA #WhatHappened #TrumpHappened 
#Deplorables 
Then... What is the solution, Senator?..
Rock on @SenWarren ! US needs more #harmreduction & some #safeinjection centres!
