Do YOUR job and investigate the #ELectionFraud #WhichWarren
the really interesting thing about her tweets is only the people that are already liberal read them. No one else does!
This is so pathetic how low Republicans will stoop!
You are clearly passionate about this. Please explain what you believe is happening in this bill today.
Take a hike you Moron!
Do you not get it? I am a neighbor of yours and yet you come out with insults and are unwilling to discuss issues.
Why?
Your a Republican and that's sad enough as it is! Sorry for you!
@verucasalt10 @Bywatergal @nhdogmom I'm not joking either, today's GOP is nothing short of hate-ridden.
The psycho is out. When did she get out her cage?
You endorsed Hillary Clinton who is getting paid bythe corporations leading those efforts. You really oughta be ashamed
You are joking.  Not true.
Goofy Liz Warren using extreme hyperbole as usual
No your not joking>your “Lying”>>@SenWarren, the @HouseGOP &Republican’s aren’t Anti LGBT..we want equality for all American Citizens.
the GOP is nothing but a bunch of obstructionist I wouldn't put nothing past them.
don't worry muslims will take care of all the LGBT & liberals & Atheist, they don't have use for U all
You support a law that "discriminates" against the life of a living human being. What's worse?
There should be religions legal protection. You rights trump no one else's. There are places that will service lgbt.
WELL good thing TRUMP supports the LGBT community!
Way to keep the partisan fighting alive Senator....

Not joking? You ARE a joke... but not the least bit funny.
- Trump welcomes the LBGT community into the Republican tent.  FIrst time in history!  @bigmouthpol
Too bad you post a tweet with no factual details, just like Crooked Hillary.  Why do you support this criminal?
you think we are stupid who is going to pay for all this free stuff the working class
What can I as a Transgender in TN do to help
Its a good thing Jesus isn't around who condemned Homosexuality as an abomination unto God.
Because "right now" Hilary supports LGBT... even though she didn't used to https://youtu.be/BH7D5XMKjiA 
Democrats have spent decades meeting about making it easier to discriminate against straight people, white people, males, etc.
liar!
.@SenWarren @HouseGOP what ever bull she isn't sitting on.... comes out her forked tongue
:(
it is so shameful that gop is creating more division in this country.  So SHAMEFUL
@sheenA_8886 @HouseGOP They just can't b decent, no matter what. These r the haters folks! Send them all packing in Nov 2016
You're not joking, you're lying
Have you ever lied?
what the hell are you talking about? Stop making up stories
And why are these criminals not up to their ears in ethics charges and other hot water?
I don't agree with LGBT lifestyle. That is my right to have my own opinion. Just like you have yours old lady.
They are doing this because they are against DOMA.
good
you are always inciting hate with lgbt community? Why
this is sad, warren lies like water flows
Whose rights are more important? My dtr shouldn't have to be in a locker room with someone with a penis. Disgusting!!!!
Such a worthwhile way to WASTE YOUR TAX $$$$
GOOD! Sick of being treated bad as a white woman & my husband is a white male. No faith left in DEMS. #TrumpTrain
Please keep fighting for #LGBT rights
@HouseDemocrats #WeThePeople disagree w/ @SenWarren
If successful, GOP will expand its "freedom to discriminate" laws to other groups.
@ManMet80 @HouseGOP #VOTE Republicans out of local state and federal government #ENOUGH #HiLLYeS #WOMANCARD #GUNSENSE #LGBT
That's how they roll Senator..   @SpeakerRyan
@No_Idteaots @HouseGOP I believe it. Im starting to wonder who is really running the GoP?? #ditchmitch #dumptrump #ImWithHer
Same ppl running Bernie
ARE you sure that is the language of the bill
I'm not kidding. 5 of 11 NC Dems that supported #HB2 endorsed Hillary Clinton.
@Clarknt67 @HouseGOP the GOP is full of bigots who hide behind Christ
the Republican Party has lost their mind. The party is done & time for a reboot. #Hillary2016 #lgbt
I REALLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT
.@SenWarren @HouseGOP this is ridiculous
.@SenWarren @sarahcuda @HouseGOP wait wat?
@Benioff @HouseGOP ? Please explain
@Benioff @HouseGOP Your credibility is shot! Only a fool would believe your twisting of facts!
No shock, they need faux-Christian $ to add to their NRA taxpayer subsidized paychecks.
Besides yourself Elizabeth is there anyone in Washington that is not bought and paid for?
Liz, don't you have some fire water you should be drinking now.
Come on, now. You can't relax on a historically long vacation from doing nothing w/out sticking it to the homos first!
Not again!
they need diversionary tactics to keep people's minds off the other F'd up things they're plotting. #GOPScumbags
this is why we need a Vice President like Senator Warren. She is our go getter and wont back down. LGBT will prosper
es terrible
disappointed but not surprised
Please stay focus on the reality of #BlackLivesMatter fatal discrimination in Baton Rouge, Minnesota, Dallas & USA
talking about  a race under attack for 400yrs+ & cops killing A/A men; not one gay man killed by cops
UNFRICKIN BELIEVABLE!!!
VOTE THEM ALL OUT NOVEMBER 8th!!!
@universe2519 @HouseGOP They are Going on Vacation, essentially saying to Americans,'I dont Care that You Americans are Grieving!
'I do not Care That Some Americans are Counting on GOP, they dont care, THEY ARE NEGLIGENT IN MY OPINION!
GOP DOES NOT HOLD THEMSELVES ACCOUNTABLE BUT THEY CAN SURE FABRICATE EVIDENCE ON OTHERS! DAMN CRIMINAL!
@SenWarren @HouseGOP
well it may be challenged by the separation clause.
@SenWarren @HouseGOP
@SenWarren @HouseGOP
insanity!
@SaraBethSimon @HouseGOP and the I as in LGBTI are we are we excluded.
Did they mention Monica Lewinsky yet?
Not surprised @HouseGOP is spreading more hate.
Why can gay people have all equal rights in South Africa (even in churches) but not in the USA? The mind boggles.
and they wonder why people don't take them seriously. They'll lose anyone under 30 for a generation
I don't mind that at all. But still, is there any adult supervision? Common sense?
Corporate paid political theatre. look, look this hand right here, as other hand takes wallet or life
perfect. It's a magic trick - and we pay the price.
and we pay it over and over and over again
I RT everything Sen Warren sends out.  No, she's not joking.
How did we get to democracy for some?
Their priorities are mixed up. How can they respect themselves and their jobs? They obviously don't respect the People!
-Go away, you fraud. Cherokee 
da fuq
Must expose do-nothing GOP as the elitists they & Trump truly are. Where's his tax reports?
@stutteringjohnm @HouseGOP I forget, which tribe are you from? My full blooded Apache grandmother and I hear your forked tongue
Oy... I voted for you, but I feel like I need to be doing more. What else can I do to help?
As a citizen I am sickened by this display of hatred. discrimination has no place in our constitution #VoteBlueDem
Its called not given up even when you know that you have lost. Bad losers.
I hope you set up a soap box right in front of GOP Convention & simply blast their whole decrepit program
@EdDarrell @HouseGOP Ya, you are kidding. Put the blunt down.
Hey, Elizabeth, I'm 1/247th Cherokee. You and me, we're people of color.
The only reason why I would vote for Hillary is if she picks you as V President. You can do much good for our country.
well Senator those LBGT people aren't going to discriminate against themselves now are they?
I like your moxy and thought you were good for the discussion.Just another out of touch radical with a closed mind.
you are only posting this so people don't pay attention to rigged loretta lynch who wouldn't answer 74 questions.
@Arianna8927 @HouseGOP how are they doing this?
We live in a land of morons. Does GOP mean Gluttonous Oligarchs Party? I hate GOP.
@FilthyDonald @HouseGOP Disgusting excuse of a political party!
Unbelievable. The GOP has destroyed their own party with their obstructionist, anti female, anti gay politics. #DieGOP
only in America can we have a separation of church and state... yet allow church to permeate our legislative process.
Like brainstorming in TX about how to make (Supreme Court ordered) legal abortions hard/impossible to get.
why not you and this admin let hundreds of thousands of refugees who kill and execute gays @LGBTfdn @LGBT @lgb
yes they r, they r consumed wth trying to stigmatize or deny us.
Following Pence's lead.
@Jdgbert @HouseGOP Let me fake my surprise! Oh can't! Sorry
@GOP Donald is their man - they are who you think they are.
so desperate they are a train wreck.
don't let them legislate hate with FADA.  Keep fighting, Sen. Warren!
is there a stream or sooner somewhere we can watch this or is it closed doors?
Easy to understand considering they think porn is far more dangerous than weapons of war in hands of reckless @HouseGOP
@CathInman @HouseGOP ,who is surprised ! The GOP to date has spent $100M of tax money &d got zip , lets run  it up
angry
RIP #GOP.
shut up and back to your teepee!
Despicable...
This is absurd! It's 2016. SHAME on the GOP! Ding, ding, ding. SHAME. SHAME. SHAME! #shame #shamenun
If Congress reflected the American people, then it'd be ~42% independent, ~29% Dem & ~26% Republican.
But this is what happens when we allow a minority party to gain a majority of power. #OurRevolution is about fixing that.
@DebraMessing @HouseGOP we have to stop the hate. We must protect all citizens!
I wake each day blessing hearts.   It seems today will be no different.
They all are so precious.
@DebraMessing @HouseGOP
theyr SPITTING ON THE CONSTITUTION/SCOTUS! No doubt they try 2 force THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ON ALL OF US
Not Scotus yet??
@Gabbiedrice78K @HouseGOP Because Christ would discriminate against people. No? Of course not. Love your neighbor
not suprised at the #stupidparty tactics
I I feel less safe and more disrespect & hate than I did a year ago. Focus on the real problems effing GOP
One step forward with same sex marriage 10 step backwards with things like this :(
The #GOPHypocrites claim to be Party to unify America, how can they when they do not believe in equality? This divides.
Can we get a thumbs down icon? It's law GOP, give it up! We need love, not this crap!
The GOP hasn't had true compassion since Lincoln and I don't see them rectifying that anytime soon; unfortunately.
How about an original thought from that band-wagon you always seem to be on!
Your lies and hyperbole are the source of hate. Try having an honest debate for once in your life Pocahontas.

.
@anunlikelybrit @HouseGOP of course they are, not not guns, selling off public lands, not doing their jobs
How many meetings did the DNC have to oppress #Bernie & suppress his voting base?
It's rather humorous to see people here suggesting that "progress" means giving total control to the government. Sad!
#BlackLivesMatter
Can Somebody..Anybody.. Hold Hearing on the Senseless  Murders by Cops designed to look like enforcement of the law!
- we must never let our guard down
Ummmm. No. Liar. Like your Pocahontas background. You need to be removed from Congress for your continuous lies.

.
Why do people have to attack the tweeter instead of addressing the issue? She is stating a fact, that's all.
that is just pure hate to do that to another group of people that is different from them.

@jamieLcowan @HouseGOP Congress needs to end divisive and polarizing behavior, model for the country!
Throwing red meat to the base. It's all they do.
When will this end? This is a religious stand, which shld NOT be in politics.
@ManMet80 @HouseGOP #VoteOutRepublicans
Let me put on my shocked face... hateful terrorists.
GOP, party of discrimination and hate.
that is so awful in this time we need 2 unite makes me so sad America first must unite
@sisboombahbah @HouseGOP Tell me again how much #ElectionFraud in Repub primaries? #ExitPolls #DNCfraud 8 failed years #GoFish

@AuntLulie @HouseGOP Continued demonstration of their insecurities regarding change. Custer's Last Conservative Stand!?
and they wonder why the "gays" hate them.
No they are not.
Liar......
@ranman09 @HouseGOP they just don't like anyone. Will never be upheld by the Supreme Court.
~ it's that type of action and example that leads people to believe we're unworthy, including many lgbt's...STOP IT!!!
@DebraMessing @HouseGOP our fight is never over just leave us alone
Waste of time. SCOTUS will overturn.
@JeremyDeeSelden @HouseGOP shame on them!!!!
@SenWarren @mms5048 @HouseGOP
This is so typical the BSers who  refuse to give @JudgeGarland a hearing.We have to #UniteBlue to clean up this mess.
Disgusting! Un-American!
Self centered holier than thou
self proclaimed Kings!
@ThePerezHilton @HouseGOP NOT OK. We the people do not agree!
