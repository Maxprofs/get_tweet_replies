@keithellison @NancyPelosi Right...You say that while you take their benefits away. What a hypocritical evil person you are
@Red_Sox_Fan777 @keithellison By NOT letting #Veterans die at #VA hospitals while the bureaucrats get bonuses!!!!
@Powerfactor1 @Red_Sox_Fan777 @keithellison Artific'ly forcing wage incrses -->incrs prices/cut staff--&DEAD vets can't earn ANY wage. #tcot
@keithellison @carmenvellon income inequality must change coarse, raise the wage is a good first step. Rich is wealthy enough.

#1010Means incompetent people and teenagers will get more undeserved $.  If you earn MW, there's a reason!  @keithellison @Sharp2018
@ParisParamus @keithellison If it is going to right we need to do this! #RaiseTheWage
#1010Means The demagogic morons are in charge. @Sharp2018 @keithellison
@keithellison @MaxineWaters you can thank hundreds of thousands of vets and 3.4Million Americans if you raise the roof to #RenewUI
@keithellison: #1010means 1 million vets will see pay increase. Let's thank our soldiers and #RaiseTheWage
@keithellison Bullshit! You want to "thank Veterans", do so by revamping Veteran's Affairs.  40 died at one hosp waiting to get appointments
@keithellison please keep the fight for MW increase going. We the American people are solidly with u.  We shall prevail. Thanks 4 ur efforts
@keithellison #1010means #RaiseTheWage let's thank vets by raising minimum wage thus killing jobs? Makes no sense
@tgnoble @keithellison Are u now saying that whenever ur employers gave u a pay raise it always led to job loss? What a dumb theory!
@DansAdorable @keithellison When you force a company to pay more than they can afford to pay, they fire people or cut hours
@tgnoble @keithellison How do u expect a single-mom working 40 hours a week to care for her kids with less than $15,000 a year? Where's ur
@DansAdorable @keithellison if the pay is not good enough, don't take the job, get a different one with more pay.
@keithellison @ChrisVanHollen @BabsLakey1 Proud Keith Ellison is from Minnesota! Rep Ellison works very hard for ALL people! ~babs #VOTEBLUE
@keithellison @Clyburn U #use #veterans 2 increase #effectiveness of your #rhetoric while #KingObama lets them #die slowly on a #list
@keithellison @NancyPelosi NO Keith! You can make sure the vets get proper health care instead of death warrants at the VA!
@keithellison I'm a veteran and I don't get ANY pay you idiot! Who is going to pay for this? I'm betting NOT you, but consumers!

@keithellison No offense, but I encourage veterans to bypass minimum wage and head to college. Active or Veteran, Think college!
@keithellison This will increase the desire for more inmigrante indocumentado workers in the corporations.
@keithellison @NancyPelosi Are you fucking kidding me. You people have lost all touch with reality.
@keithellison @NancyPelosi Once again, vets and military are props Democrats. NONE of them care about military or vets. #disconnect
@keithellison @MaxineWaters Shut Up and quit using us to promote you bullshit lies! We, the Vets DO NOT WANT NOR NEED YOUR HELP!
@keithellison  how about giving our troop a good country to support
@keithellison #1010means #RaiseTheWage because #ObamaCare didn't kill enough jobs, let's continue job killing by raising the minimum wage
@keithellison @NancyPelosi Using veterans shocker to push a bogus agenda. Wipe the drool from ur lips 1010 1010 duh
@keithellison @NancyPelosi trying to tie in American heroes to your dream of a high minimum wage is disgraceful.
@keithellison I am a veteran  and couldn't agree with you more.ean forward.
@keithellison @NancyPelosi Let's thank them as well by not starting more stupid wars for oil.
@keithellison @NancyPelosi  no
@keithellison Let's cut your pay then raise minimum wage You get paid for doing nothing
@keithellison We thank you for your fight!!! #Vet  #UniteBlue
@keithellison @NancyPelosi That is the most ignorant statement. You don't have to raise the minimum wage to help the veterans. Idiot!
. @keithellison @NancyPelosi If you want to help veterans STOP CUTTING THEIR BENEFITS and giving it to illegals!
@keithellison @NancyPelosi U DIRTY OLD BAT STOP USING MY VETS
@keithellison @NancyPelosi galation6chapter7versesaysbenotdeceivegodisnotmockedwhateveryousowthatwillyouallsoreapwearegodschildrenforsure
@keithellison are u kidding me?? How about a raise to the minimum wage for real
@keithellison @NancyPelosi GLAD to see the Bill went through...I've been following over @USHouse....
@keithellison @MaxineWaters But we just cut your pension!
.@keithellison Why so worried about the minimum wage, take care of our vets the way they should be, the wage will care for itself.
@keithellison if we get a 5.00 increase in pay we make 12.00 less in pay from the year before because of your spending and Pres tax increase
@keithellison well so far since Obama been elected the increase isn't one because he offsets it with a tax increace now we make < then befor
@keithellison @KingAbrahm Also might help to increase their veteran benefits and expand the va. Stop cutting food stamps, they need them!
@keithellison @WhipHoyer thank you for setting up veterans to only have skills for these jobs that this bill is needed...
@keithellison @WhipHoyer YOU CLOWNS SHOULD INCREASE DAV COLAS AND BENEFITS FOR WAR WOUNDS. @SpeakerBoehner
How about not cutting the Military Salaries and increasing that so Millions more see something. @keithellison @NancyPelosi #military #TCOT
@keithellison the BEST way to thank vets is to create jobs for the un/underemployed vets.  Also to cut Gov spending to lower their taxes.
@keithellison @NancyPelosi STOP USING OUR VETS
@keithellison @MsRock4Ever Keith, don't let the bastards get you down.
@keithellison is one of the BEST men in Congress, he's worked hard for working class Americans and Common Sense laws. @leftypatriot
@MsRock4Ever @keithellison Amen, sister.
@keithellison @NancyPelosi YOU SHOULD #ImpeachObama FOR #IRS #Benghazi #fastandfurious #funding MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD
@keithellison @NancyPelosi Oh yeah leave it to Dems to make their lives better #VA
@keithellison @ChrisVanHollen isn't the bigger issue that our veterans have no choice but to take minimum wage jobs?
@keithellison @ChrisVanHollen #Veterans need jobs not a raise. Start there. President #Obama has failed veterans.
@keithellison Thank You #Soldiers #Marines #Sailors #Airmen #CoastGuard #CongressmanEllison #RepresentativeGovernment #RaiseTheWage #1010
@keithellison @NancyPelosi could thank 270K if Congress would vote #RenewUI We are not a disease thats going away we are AMERICANS TOO!
@keithellison @NancyPelosi Start with keeping our promises to them. #FixVAHealthCare. And stop skimping on AD health care, as well.
@keithellison @NancyPelosi According to the government, only 2.1% of the work force is on min. wage. 97.9% are not. http://goo.gl/6NRlvw 
@keithellison @NancyPelosi By the way maybe if you dinks didn't overregulate & overtax everything and everyone this problem would be moot
@keithellison @NancyPelosi Raising the wage creates higher employment = more welfare = Dem voters tell the truth you morons #jobbasedwage
@keithellison @NancyPelosi pardon me unemployment .. a job based wage system creates incentive to grow skill level but you don't want that
@keithellison @RepEliotEngel #renewui thanks for helping the vets -how about the 4 milln long term unemplyed ask spkr to bring bill to vote
@keithellison ANOTHER LIBERAL LIE...LIBERAL LOGIC MAKES NO SINCE FOR AMERICA
@keithellison WITH FUEL AND FOOD PRICES SKY ROCKETING DEMOCRATS SOLUTION IS TO RAISE PRICES MORE FOR THE 300 MILLION WHO WOULDN'T GET RAISE
@keithellison @NancyPelosi Pelosi you disgust me to the point I want to vomit.
@keithellison @NancyPelosi Clearly these #Dumbocrats are severely out of touch with reality. Using #Vets to further destroy our economy?
@keithellison @HouseDemocrats Why do you insist on using our troops and vets as a pawn in your political games you should be ashamed
@keithellison @NancyPelosi Passing HR:25 Fair Tax Bill HR:25 will give 300+ million Citizens & all Vets areal raise!
@keithellison @NancyPelosi THEY don't make minimum wage FOOL! Yet, u cut defense budgets. U want it both ways #Liberal BS #Doublespeak
@keithellison #1010means #RaiseTheWage linking minimum wage to "thanking veterans" is the most absurd, dishonest & dumbest thing I've heard
@tgnoble @keithellison brilliant statement.  I'm a Veteran and worked my ass off..don't need to be lumped w/ unmotivated #libdouches
