@repjoecrowley @HouseDemocrats Is this a parody account?

@repjoecrowley Why are you part of spreading this garbage.
@repjoecrowley @WhipHoyer We have been hearing about "your plan" for more than six years. What's taking so long to implement?
@repjoecrowley @HouseDemocrats the plan is not worth the paper it is printed on.  Study some macro economics and get out of the way.
But much like the right just yapping bitchn and moaning, AZ & US Democrats... 
 @repjoecrowley @KennettDems
@repjoecrowley @HouseDemocrats congratulations.....as it only took you 6 yrs. to create an economic growth plan...amazing to boast about it
