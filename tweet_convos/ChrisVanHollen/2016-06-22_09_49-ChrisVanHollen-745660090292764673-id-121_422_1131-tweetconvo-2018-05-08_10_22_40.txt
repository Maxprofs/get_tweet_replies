@HouseDemocrats So the 14th Amendment no longer applies to U.S. citizens? How about pass a bill to ban HATE mosques?
Libs open borders to illegals & terrorists, give them our benefits and voting rights. Now you want to disarm us? FU
There is nothing worse than a sanctimonious liberal jerk who favors #illegals & #terrorists over its citizens. #Guncontrol

@HouseDemocrats Plan on retiring. You hide behind armed security and demand gun control vote to disarm law-abiding citizens.
