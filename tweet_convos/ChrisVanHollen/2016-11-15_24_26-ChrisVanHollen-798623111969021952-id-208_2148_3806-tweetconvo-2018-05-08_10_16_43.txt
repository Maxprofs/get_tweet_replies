@realDonaldTrump will not now or ever be my president, I will never utter those words together "president" and "Trump"
And rescinding his offers to all his other white supremacist appointees since!
What American People don't get is that"Bannon" is Trump Top Hitler on his "Brown People Massive Deportation FORCE"
Horrifying
ALL Puerto Ricans USA Citizens had to OBTAIN a "Homeland Sec. BirthCertificate under Obama.  Now Trump GAS ovens forBrown?
Ugh just Ugh!
AmericanWhites&BlacksHAVE NOTHING To WORRY aboutUnder TrumpUSA! Trump WON on "Cleansing of "Brown People" AkA "Hitler:Jews"
Sadly true
, who are YOU to determine nominees for next cabinet? Obama associated with hate monger Rev. Wright, Hillary w/ Saul Alinsky!

@AurisPerez3 thank you #Trumpprotest
@MVYRD You resign FIRST!!!!
#lockhimup #AmericaIsNot4Sale https://www.facebook.com/exposingtrumpsdirtysecret/ …
add Jeff Sessions
I whole wholeheartedly agree, thank you for saying so.
that sounds like a passive aggressive threat.
Thank you for speaking up about Bannon. So glad to have you representing us.
washington has to shove him out
Dear Chris, Please tweet a picture of yourself with your @Sojourners wrist band. We - the women of Maryland -  need you!
Thank you so much for all your work on behalf of Marylanders.
thank you
I voted for the right candidate. TY 4 speaking up.
I voted for you. I'd advise you engage your constituents. Disappearing from Twitter for days @ a time not wise. Be brave.
@HouseBudgetDems I beg ur pardon Chris; he's a Navy Veteran & served his country well...
Will you lead the way for @SenateDems? #WithholdConsent till (1) Bannon is out of the WH and (2) #TrumpTaxes are released?
& now he is in the innermost circle of national security, top military & intelligence advisers out! #withholdconsent #resist
he's not the only one that shouldn't be there
Please fight against repeal of affordable care act!
This kind of unfounded, slanderous commentary intended to mislead & stir hatred in our community is sick. UN2334. yourself
AGREED! The entire proposed cabinet is terrifying all of us. Each new day, new tweet, new appt is never-ending nightmare.
Senator @ChrisVanHollen heavily courts Cameroonians in Maryland for BlackVoters, & refuses to acknowledge marginalized NW/SW Cameroon people
yes, #firebannon and #ImpeachTrump!
@rugratfarm he meant only "all non-brown Americans"
What about van jones? U didn't squawk about a commie. Bastard
except it was Trump who pledged to unify and be President for "all Americans." Bannon is not a promising start.
@ChrisVanHollen
THANK YOU for representing our interests in Maryland.
please support Senator Warren's bill that addresses Trump's ongoing and unconstitutional conflicts of interest.  Thank You!
Love you Maryland miss the crabs.
Please be sure congress maintains their oversight of this Pres. he is dangerous
Agree 100% Bannon, and, also the 2 Flynn's. BOTH, not just the son. Thank U. Gen Mattis is acceptable I believe.
Congrat on your win
@pmm526 right
That is none of your damned business.
one more reason when you say Senator, we say Chris. So glad Maryland sent a strong voice for all people.
Thank you. I just sent a letter to your office with the exact same sentiment.
can you provide a single shred of evidence to back this claim that Bannon is a racist?
but because Trump never admits he's wrong he will never rescind
thank you.
thank you to my senator elect and current congressman.
Thank you for your statements against Bannon. So proud to have you representing Maryland.
Also last hope for Senate and not seeing much on this! Please support/donate RT #FosterCampbell http://www.fostercampbell2016.com 
why not
WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE??  HE IS POTUS ELECT, ITS HIS CHOICE, HIS TEAM. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?? THIS IS WHY DEMS LOSE.
thank you for standing up and opposing Bannon's appointment!
absolutely
@greathousetweet step back in time and recall Rev Sharpton saying "kill whites and police" stupid fucks. #MAGA #keepbannon
Congrats on writing a great house tweet! http://greathousetweets.measuredvoice.com/ChrisVanHollen/status/798623111969021952 … (Ranked 1st for Nov 15.)
Thank you for speaking out against Bannon! We need more voices like yours in the US Senate.
so glad I voted for you! #onegoodthing from #Election2016
thank you!
constituent here. Keep the pressure on.
i fear Mr. Trump only meant all white racist right-wing Americans.. the rest are all the enemy according to his rhetoric
, I so appreciate that you responded immediately to this highly disturbing appointment. We must not normalize hate speech.
@1DancingCrane Please insist on this! Thank you for your service to our country~
thank you for taking a stand!
I don't agree with Bannon being in there but if you live in America you're under 'All Americans' and he is the president lol
Lifer politician gets no respect
Stop drinking the Koolaid, Chris.
Neither did Valarie Jarrett.
Shouldn't even be aloud on the grounds. Maybe this is the part where he intentionally gets fired?
for all Americans except for people who don't think exactly like you do, like Bannon. Such hypocrisy
Either does the Muslim Brotherhood but you were ok with that! So quit whining! You all were crooked for the last 8 years!
And now Gaffney?  Saints preserve us.
Thank you,Senator.The Southern Poverty Law Center has a petition out as well.
Didn't care that Obama governed as an anti-American racist for 8 yrs so you can shut up and get in the back of the bus Chris
Tell us about your opposition to the muslim brotherhood connections to the Obama WH...
Thank you! This is why I voted for you! I am looking forward to all the great things you will do.
, thank you for being a thought leader! Proud to be a Marylander.
What are Dems going to do about it?  Nothing!  Stop grandstanding and fight for your non White base!
And by releasing his taxes, so we know that he's not in bed with Russia, China, or Iran. @ChrisVanHollen
Thank you!
Thank you for speaking out against hate! Your staff was v responsive when I called.
@JackieC1989 I Agree!
Neither does Ben Carson, Sarah Palin or Mike Pence. :( @awestover
Really? Where you when all radicals in Obama's admin were getting appointed, and how about Huma??? #Hypocrite
THANK YOU
@MaggieJordanACN  Thank you for stepping up.
Thank you. You had my vote and I'm grateful to see you standing up against hate.
so glad I voted for you!
Thank you for speaking for us! @ellembee
@bannerite Neither does Trump
Thank you for speaking out. We need your voices to stay steady and loud.
Thank you. So proud to have voted for you.
@SupermanHotMale  @realDonaldTrump is your president. No changes for now, no matter what crazy idea you have in your mind.
Elections have consequences! Discount working class concerns @ own peril.
Obama invited the black panthers to the White House and you are complaining about Brannon? You have no room to talk.
*Bannon
@jdf0325 Hold your ground, tell other democrats to hold theirs too!!!
@marcylauren he is good at firing people right?
And so who elected you to be in charge of Donald Trumps decisions? ......thought so.
Thank you for taking a stand!
Thankful I can count on you to truly represent my values. This is a fight we must not back down from.
Lol lol lol
Will huff & puff stomp & snort be your next trick
Don't count on it. The KLAN is in town. You white folks watched silently as the klan rolled in. R u alarmed now?
They will soon go on a 'murder' spree. What will you say then?
He can start by resigning and urging Electoral College to elect @HillaryClinton on Dec. 19.
Thank you! Please encourage other members of congress to speak out. Do not normalize Alt Right/White Nationalism #stopbannon
- news alert! This is not your job to offer.   Nobody cares to hear you squawk
You know, even if he does fire Bannon the symbolism will stick. Damage done, taint permanent, no takebacks.
And Valerie Jarrett did?
yea BLM and Muslim brotherhood fit in well in the White House huh
@JustWhatNowWhy

@POTUS

@realDonaldTrump (scumbag)

@HillaryClinton
@elizabethforma
thank you for this truth
Trump won. You go sit in the corner.
Bannon must be a near demigod awesome for all the concern he's getting.
Trump proves once again he IS a racist, anti-Semitic bigot by appointing Bannon, an avowed white supremacist
thank you friend
THANK YOU. I wish my reps showed your courage and values. Still time to speak out, @SenPatRoberts @JerryMoran @TimHuelskamp
your party has no say. this is what we want
Elections have consequences, sound familiar? Get over it.
Thank you.
@hbarkey He is just going to be president for the winners. Losers got it all wrong.
My Senator-elect! I'm proud of you!
Did TheGerman PEOPLE "Fire Hitler" why would White America Fire Bannon?Hitler made Jews"illegals"Trump BrownPeople
hes not a white supremacist. he was T's camp manager and is the standing ceo of Breitbart News
EVERY Dem Senator should put filibuster this freak!
please continue to speak out. Bannon has no place in the White House.
So only Dems are speaking out about Bannon.. just more proof Repulicans support white nationalism
I am waiting for my congressman @RepBrady to step forward and not lurk in the sidelines
NO, I think the sexual predator dropping dead is the only way Americans can come together.
Thank you so much for your statement. Proud to have you as a fellow Swat alum!
Thank you for standing firm on principle!
thank you!!!
I suggest creating & propagating a hashtag like #BanBannon to draw attention to the issue.
you have no power. bannon is our choice and we won
@thinker128 He could also just step aside.
thank you for representing Marylanders and justice
swapping him out for someone else isn't likely to make it any different you know @bubbadeloach
I know. He'd just replace him with another bigot.
thank you Senator!
Where are the checks and balances going to come from when he controls all three branches of government?  What's the plan?
You forgot to mention that it's because he's a WHITE SUPREMACIST so I'll go ahead and say it for you.
@NavKaz 
During campaign, Hillary stated she wld  work with DJT to unite us, regardless of who won. He shld reach out to her
I'm liking Maryland
Thank you!!!!
Who the fuck are you to tell the President what to do?
@JJohnsonLaw And the Senate can start by confirming Merrick Garland.
PROVE that he has no place. Besides, libs lose the moral high ground every time because of baby killing.
Thank you! I've been calling my @SenSchumer but he won't condemn. Please don't support him as minority leader if he won't!
I hate that you are my guy.
really?  Fire the guy who just led him to victory. You don't have anything better to do?
He won=his choice, suck it up
that is horrible logic
how so? Is it not Trump's choice?
he should have America's best interest in mind
he needs someone he can trust, he trusts bannon, he doesn't need our approval or disapproval on staff in my opinion
take off the blinders
ok keep drinking the liberal kool aid
it's called common sense
What upsets Ryan: Americans receiving stable Medicare. What doesn't: Trump making a white nationalist his CHIEF strategist!
If there's a @GOP sleeze with lesser core values than @realDonaldTrump it is @SpeakerRyan. 
SPINELESS DOLT
@LOLGOP @amyklobuchar Amy, @SenFranken is in agreement now it's your turn to deny Bannon WH access, please!
Go Chris.
you have no power on the #Presidential selections! #TrumpTrain
Thank you.
@LOLGOP He certainly doesn't represent me.
@LOLGOP thank you Sir
.@ChrisVanHollen @kwicrkd How to look foolish before you are re sworn in
Get rid of Bannon, do you even know who will be running the country, it will be Stevie Bannon. Trump will be a figure head
Bannon is not a white supremacist. Stop falling for the media lies.
@LOLGOP hey, he won, he'll decide who is "American" around here
Bannon is great you should resign
@realDonaldTrump will fire Bannon at his own risk, right Steve and @DeplorableTrain and @DrDavidDuke
thank you
thank you.
why aren't we investigating the election itself for fraud and hacking from the Russians?!
#DumpBannon
thank you for standing up to this!
Thank you.
thanks for standing up to this!! Anything else we can do?
But neither does Trump. Is no one taking election fraud seriously?!
, thank you for representing our interests!
thank you and @SenatorCardin for your attention to this issue.
what can your constituents do?
Trump has already proven that he is NOT president for all, by giving Bannon the job in 1st place
I'm so proud that you are the voice for my district!
was literally just about to call your office about this! thank you!!
good stuff @ChrisVanHollen 
If Trump wants to be "president for all Americans," he can start by rescinding his job offer to Bannon. He has no place in the White House.
