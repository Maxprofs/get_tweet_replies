@FluidAttack @ChrisVanHollen you're missing the point. Assault weapons ban, not a complete gun ban!
"assault weapon" is a meaningless not-word designed to scare you into demanding the surrender of Constitutional rights. @IMMDFH @FluidAttack
@CplSoletrain @FluidAttack tell that 2 some1 who didn't grow up N WV with a family that loves guns. I know the difference. Fool some1 else!
If you knew anything about guns, you'd know that "assault weapon" isn't a thing. So I call bullshit.@IMMDFH @FluidAttack
@CplSoletrain ASSume elsewhere! I grew up n WV with a family that loves guns. Have seen the tragedies 1st hand!
But you don't know the first thing about guns. So growing up and learning are clearly different. So there's that. @IMMDFH
@CplSoletrain AGAIN! ASSume elsewhere! I got my first deer when I was 9. We are still avid hunters!
@ChrisVanHollen @Made0fHonor 
Rednecks need 30 rounds,
to shoot a deer?

Wouldn't glasses be cheaper?
@bjennings812 @ChrisVanHollen 
@Made0fHonor
Military-style? Please define. AR-15 uses a .223, which makes it a varmint gun. Military uses 5.56. @ChrisVanHollen
@CplSoletrain I’m on your side of this, but you know .223 inches and 5.56 mm are the same caliber, right ;~)?
Give it a shot. 3-12 5.56 through a .223 destroys your varmint gun. Stovepipe if you're lucky, total blowout if not. @PrestonCalvert
@CplSoletrain I’ve done it without any problems.  Mainly a theoretical concern:
I have an obliterated AR from back in the day that doesn't think it's theory. Also, how many .223 AP's you find?@PrestonCalvert
@ChrisVanHollen The ones that are painted black and have the shoulder go-up thingies are the worst, right?  Gawd, the ignorance.
Don't forget that bayonet stud. @FormerlyFormer @ChrisVanHollen
You want to disarm innocent Americans while arming ISIS. You should be arrested and tried for treason. @ChrisVanHollen
@ChrisVanHollen 2A was for organized military service in the states, subject to command by POTUS. Now its a joke
@ChrisVanHollen Maybe not your community, but that doesn't give you the right to take it from my community.
@ChrisVanHollen Notice how you have to add "Style" on the end there? That's like saying "Juice Drink". It's not real juice, its a trick.
@ChrisVanHollen "Juice Drink" isn't real juice. Military "Style" Weapons are not designed for the military. 

If so, they'd have full auto.
.@ChrisVanHollen Are you really this insane? NO firearms are designed for mass shootings you despicable hoplophobe #AssaultWeaponsBan
@Conservativeind @ChrisVanHollen all rifles combined account for .0703% of homicides. It's not about the gun. They want control.
@ChrisVanHollen true assault weapons are NOT available to the general public zippy. Do yr research on what constitutes REAL assault weapons.
@ChrisVanHollen "Military Style" is to Semi-Auto Firearms as "Juice Drink" is to real juice. As in the term doesn't apply.
We need to disarm government. The USDA doesn't need .40S&W MACHINE GUNS for beef inspectors. @ChrisVanHollen
@MomsDement @AaronWorthing It's going to be fun when asshats like @ChrisVanHollen show up at American homes and try to take our guns!
Nah. @ChrisVanHollen is too chickenshit to be first through the doors & into the funnel. @gary4205 @AaronWorthing
@ChrisVanHollen no weapon is designed for mass shootings. You're a #hoplophobe.
@ChrisVanHollen Keep demonizing inanimate objects and more will be aquired by law abiding citizens. Good job!
@ChrisVanHollen I have a Natural God given right to self protection using the means I deem necessary. Shut up & stay off MY RIGHTS!
@ChrisVanHollen Wtf is an "assault weapon"?  Any tool can be used to assault someone.  Even words.  Can you at least count to potato? See?
@ChrisVanHollen Congrats on writing a great house tweet! http://greathousetweets.measuredvoice.com/ChrisVanHollen/status/677221986041503744 … (Ranked 3rd for Dec 16.)
.@ChrisVanHollen American gun culture has become sick, extreme & dangerous. Thank U for restoring sanity & decency.
.@ChrisVanHollen ban any plate larger then 6" because that's large enough for a meal! Obesity kills and costs more then guns!!!
@ChrisVanHollen apparently you think this country is populated by serfs, and not citizens. you'd be wrong about that.
@ChrisVanHollen What is a "military-style weapon?" Why do they have no place in our community? http://www.propublica.org/article/fact-checking-feinstein-on-the-assault-weapons-ban …
@ChrisVanHollen Let's make pipe style bombs illegal too.  Then no one will have them.
@ChrisVanHollen Using the phrase "military style assault weapon" is for people who don't understand the mechanics of the weapons. (3)
@ChrisVanHollen It operates no differently than a semi auto made to look like a "military style assault weapon". (2)
@ChrisVanHollen Fully auto is already banned.  Semi auto, one pull one shot, come in many different looks. My squirrel gun is semi.  (1)
@ChrisVanHollen Dunno, Chris....its pretty dangerous on the mean streets of Bethesda, Rockville, and Chevy Chase.....scary white people..
@ChrisVanHollen all your bluster along about terrorism and gun control has resulted in lowest support for ban ever. Congrats!
@ChrisVanHollen What's military-style? It's either military or not.
@MemphisGrits @ChrisVanHollen  So how do you plan to get rid of us?
@ChrisVanHollen
@ChrisVanHollen 
For a rifle to be an "Assault Rifle", it has to be fully automatic capable. They are already banned
@Dwarfclone @ChrisVanHollen <-- wants to be a Senator, clueless about existing law. #incompetent #pandering
@c_cgottlieb @ChrisVanHollen 
With examples of stupidity like this, he may not even be elected dog catcher.....or poop scooper.  #JustSaying
@Dwarfclone @ChrisVanHollen Sadly, he's already held office in the People's Republic of Maryland.
@ChrisVanHollen an opinion steeped in fear and ignorance. You do you....stay out of other peoples choices
@RuncibleSpoun "Military-style", "livable wage", "climate change"...malleable terms tossed around for consumption by idiots. @ChrisVanHollen
. @ChrisVanHollen Paint them pink. Definitely not any military's style.
@ChrisVanHollen The RIGHT to keep & bear arms SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED ~ #2ndAmendment to the United States Constitution #tcot #ComeAndTakeIt
@ChrisVanHollen American people have the ABSOLUTE RIGHT to have the same weapons as the government has That's the POINT of the #2ndAmendment
@gary4205 @maggiebeauchamp @ChrisVanHollen suggest cvh read the federalist # 46
@ChrisVanHollen Congratulations Mr. Van Hollen. This little political stunt will single handily sell 1000s of guns. #gunsense #guncontrol
@ChrisVanHollen Why the @CapitolPolice and @SecretService carry them? Have you introduced a bill to prevent them from carrying them?
@ChrisVanHollen Are you aware that you swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution ?
@ChrisVanHollen

Care to define 'assault weapon' ?
@ChrisVanHollen Militaries adopt weapons from civilian markets traditionally. ARs was a civilian product before being adopted for service.
@ChrisVanHollen I’m one of your constituents, and a 15 year Army veteran.  Your ignorance of firearms is breathtaking.  Please hush.
@ChrisVanHollen your ignorance is astounding.
Please tell me more about how the previous ban helped.
@ChrisVanHollen Every weapon is designed for assault. I will be acquiring an AR-15 as soon as possible, thank you.   #AssaultWeaponsBan
@Doobydoobydo @PrisonerNo24601 @ChrisVanHollen Check out the Colt 6721, has 1/9 twist barrel so you can shoot variety of ammo
& Its a colt
@BlueFalcon3P @PrisonerNo24601 @ChrisVanHollen Thank you for the suggestion. I will.
@ChrisVanHollen  you work for the taxpayers of America. if you want the taxpayers to continue signing ur paycheck leave R guns alone. #2A
@ChrisVanHollen Good luck with that. #2A Liberals always trying to create more victims. #WeWontBeVictims
@ChrisVanHollen FAKE NARRATIVE. #illegals have no place in our communities.
@ChrisVanHollen Are you aware that you are nothing more than a government employee? You don't seem to be.
@ChrisVanHollen I only ask because you seem to think that you get to decide the terms of your employment. You don't.
@ChrisVanHollen I'd recommend reading Locke. If you need any help, I'm here.
@ChrisVanHollen finally some sense
@chrisvanhollen @kenkircher1 used2B rule for military:no mil tech/mi l hardware exits military into non-military society;Mfrs ~>violating
@ChrisVanHollen they are for sport and a very small round. Deer rifles have a much larger round you should look at the difference
@ChrisVanHollen Then I guess you'll need to take them all back from the police before they do. Since you're not deploying them to Iraq.
@ChrisVanHollen @thepoliticalcat Let's take a strong stand to get them banned again! #StopGunViolence #terrorismhasnoreligion
@ChrisVanHollen @thepoliticalcat  And time we and the markets get a GRIP on this! http://could-should-would.blogspot.com/2015/12/coming-to-grips-with-ioft-of-americas.html?m=1 …
