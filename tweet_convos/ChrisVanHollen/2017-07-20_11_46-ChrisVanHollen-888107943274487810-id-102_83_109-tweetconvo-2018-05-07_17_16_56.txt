My sister, in Frederick, got health care under Obamacare first time in 10 years; premiums rose too much and she had to drop it.
I had one of those pre-ACA annual catastrophic-only plans in my 20s. I started having seizures before I could get real insurance again.
I had to pay for everything epilepsy-related out of pocket, which meant that I had to take older-generation drugs that I could afford.
I also had to go to a neurologist I could afford to pay out of pocket. He was not a very good neurologist.
I took an unsafe seizure medication for years because I couldn't afford the safe medications.
Two weeks before I turned 26, the ACA went into effect and I was able to get back on to my parents' insurance.
I was able to go to the hospital for the video EEG testing I needed and had never been able to afford before.
Even being briefly re-added to my parents' plan meant I became eligible for COBRA insurance that covered my medical conditions.
With real insurance, I could afford to see an epilepsy specialist with experience working with women.
I have an insurance story. I'm paying $1777/mo on the MD exchange for a BRONZE policy with a $13k deduct for 2 ppl. #ACAHorrors
OMG --- that's horrible! And that's under the so-called "Affordable" Care Act !! #bankruptcy
Yup. #ThanksObama
I have 4 chronic pain disorders, depression and anxiety,  plus aging issues (70 next b'day). Medicare cuts are TERRIFYING! Help!
Retain and repair the ACA is a national issue, but I live in Maryland, so I'm counting on you to help!

#RetainAndRepairACA
9. Please feel free to contact me at any time for more details, like secondary Dx due to cEDS. my hand is numb & painful now. I must be done
5. I have depression due to my disability. If we lose ins, then lose our home to pay my medical expenses, what is the point of me living?
My 60-yr-old wife has had ovarian cancer, IV, for 20 mos. My 26-yr-old daughter has had global dev. delays since birth; Turner syndrome also
8. I know ACA is not working well for everyone, but I think fixing it is the answer. Thank you for everything you're doing to fight this  
Survived acute ulcerative colitis & breast cancer 15 yrs ago. Shouldn't be punished for surviving by paying extra in ACA premiums.
My mom and pops, also in Frederick, rely on Medicare; both have issues, inc. diabetes, depression, anxiety.
I cannot afford health insurance because of the ACA. What are you doing about that. Your Facebook page has lots of stories like that, ideas?
He is looking for more anecdotes from the echo chamber.
Son has MS, spinal stroke and Transverse Mylelitis. 40 yr old with 2 young boys. On medicare and Medicaid. Draws $700 per month.
7. Lyme bacteria kicked it into high gear, since the borrelia bacteria bury themselves into the same connective tissue effected by EDS...
2. I am partially disabled and my seld-employed husband works hard to support our family & pay for our home. We are struggling financially.
1. I'm a late lyme survivor & Dx w cEDS last Sept. Before medicaid expansion I had no access to the Drs or treatments that saved my life.
Would you like calls as well? Some of the ppl I know don't want their stories shared on the internet, but would like to share #aca impact
You want me to fit that in a tweet? Let's start with my wish to be treated w *some* respect when I call the county about my kid's benefits.
6. cEDS is Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, classical type. it's a multi-systemic connective tissue disorder. It is degenerative & I'm only 40...
4. If we lose our home, we lose our organic gardens, which provide a lot of our food. This would also negatively effect health & finances.
3. We now have excellent coverage through the ACA, w/ subsidy towards our premium. If any of this changes we could very well lose our home,
I have a good paying job with employer healthcare but spend 10% of gross pay on premiums for my healthy family, never mind the deductible
health care has allowed me to stay on my Parent's health insurance plan.
I'm a rabbi in Maryland serving the Jewish disability community nationally, and I'm terrified. People I serve will die if this passes.
If this bill passes, many people who survive this will will lose access to Jewish community. And we've already lost so many of our people.
My son has congenital issues and meds would be $3K/m OOP. They keep him alive. Covered under my plan so far. When he turns 26? Don't know.

My niece in Baltimore was born with Down Syndrome, a pre-existing condition, and was diagnosed at age 3 with leukemia. 1/2
Luckily all post-ACA, so her preexisting conditions are not haunting her family financially, and she hasn't met lifetime/annual caps. 2/2

My son aspirated on Sat eve and his  Medicaid nurse worked 4 hrs to clear his lungs. Our hospital stays can cost over $100K. We avoided one.
Sometimes little things can set you back for months, even years... My son broke his arm... it will end up costing us a couple thousand...
This means we have to chose between what we pay until we pay off what we owe... it is ridiculous  & sad... and he only broke and arm

I have a 45 yr old son with diabetes, couldn't get coverage before Obamacare, this is the first time as an adult he's had coverage.
I am so glad he has coverage now. We need to keep this part of the ACA.

Yea, my gov is forcing me to have healthcare. It will equal out to a 768 monthly "bill". Can't afford it. Used to be able to get for 350
Bot
Constiuent here! High risk for breast cancer. ACA's essential health screenings allowed me to get insurance covered mammograms at age 30.
My husband diag. stage IV cancer in 2004. He was a sm. bus owner w/o ins. Can't go back to those days where diag. is delayed 4 uninsured.
The cost of our healthcare with the crappy bill that you forced on us has gone from $7000 per year to $ 17,000 per year. No claims for us.
My son has insurance through work but he has kidney disease & treatments are 14k per week. If insurance gives him a yearly max he is doomed.

Maryland only? My Arkansas Senators don't seem to share these kinds of stories (not listening to MINE)
My son had cancer as an infant he's 25. He won't be able to afford health care in a sick pool
A pretty mundane oneâ€”denied health care for preexisting conditions until ACA. Finally got ins and got to become a mom (x2)!
I am a veteran with an 80% disability rating, in pain all day, found work after struggling post mil, got married, realized we needed ACA.
Covers my multiple RX's and my spouse, my chronic pain treatments & routine check-ups. Prior, we had no insurance and wasn't able to afford
Yes my friend stage 4 breast cancer she's winning her fight because of the ACA if she losing the ACA no more treatments & she dies
My sister, @bakerGG, depends on #Obamacare for her health coverage. I'm outraged that anyone would take it away. #ProtectOurCare
Currently waiting at my monthly appointment to monitor and treat myopic macular degeneration. Received 11 injections in 3 years, $4K each.
Without the injections I'll become legally blind, without my insurance, can't afford the injections. No cure, so treatment always required.
My 8yr old son is disabled. He has many Dr appts every week. He struggles daily to do normal things like school, play dates, & even sitting
Down for a meal at a restaurant. Aidan is a loving and fun little boy, but he needs help daily with even small things. He is on Medicaid bc
Of this and his school uses Medicaid to pay for aides and iep programs. My beautiful boy would not be able to attend public school if he did
Not have this help. There simply would be no way to help him learn meaningfully. I'm so scared for him. He's so vulnerable and all we want
Is for him to have a full life with some independence in his future. Without Medicaid this will be next to impossible as well cannot afford
To pay cash prices for any of the therapies that he needs to be successful in life. Thank you for fighting for Aidan and others like him
I needed a few more characters than 140. I hope that's okay. #SaveTheACA
I sent a story to your office in 2010 - never heard back.
"I need anecdotes".  How about a plan instead?
My deductible went up 300%
