@ChrisVanHollen Corporations have already received their breaks.  Common people are waiting for theirs.  No deals with the GOP on this!
@ChrisVanHollen @RichCarbajal Means testing for CEOs. Throw out the Free Fail contracts.
@badwolf303 @ChrisVanHollen I say, if a CEO kills a company He/She gets nothing. NO Golden parachutes. 

*In my humble opinion.
@RichCarbajal @ChrisVanHollen  Agreed !
@ChrisVanHollen glad u r not s ceo..because so many ppl would be w/out a job for ur incompetence of how economics & business workd
So, Rep. @ChrisVanHollen, what is the plan to make sure that turnout is not 36.6% again in '16?  AND '18? @stphil

@stphil @ChrisVanHollen With all #GOPInc did to women, students, ethnic minorities .... I have no idea what it takes to motivate ppl to vote
@tyjohn47 better organized dncc.. better candidates like @ChrisVanHollen , e warren, b sanders, h dean, etc , registration (and id)drives..
@stphil @ChrisVanHollen How about scaring the heck out of the public with the idea that #GOPInc is so close to being able to rewrite it.
You just don't understand how businesses work do you? If demand employee raise do not be shocked hiring stops! @ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi
@ChrisVanHollen @repsandylevin 
And,some people don't see a problem with this!!
YOU work in Govt where U think money falls off trees. It's why U spend it on "Shrimp on treadmill!" CLUELESS! @ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi
Well that didn't take long @ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi Back to the tried and true "War On Capitalism" strategy we see.
@PJimmy18 @ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi Only morons are for unregulated capitalism. RWers want pollution from coast to coast. Idiots.
@fullofbalogna @PJimmy18 @ChrisVanHollen Impossible to be more correct. This is the face of unchecked markets:
.@ChrisVanHollen FASCIST.
“@bloodless_coup: .@ChrisVanHollen FASCIST.” You don't even know what the word means just like every other moronic RWer. Dolt.
@fullofbalogna @ChrisVanHollen Are workers chained to their desks? Don't like your job? Get a new one. Want CEO salary? BE A CEO. Grow up.
@bloodless_coup You're not very smart are you? Dumb RWer. https://twitter.com/bloodless_coup/status/530820097095770112 …
@ChrisVanHollen @RepSpeier the minimum wage should stay where it is. People who earn minimum wage usually deserve that type of pay.
@ChrisVanHollen @HouseDemocrats CEO pay is institutionalized embezzlement. @TeaPartyExpress should save taxpayers from subsidizing
@ChrisVanHollen Nor should they get tax breaks for legal settlements.
.@ChrisVanHollen Since WHEN do YOU decide how a private corporation spends it money? WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? Wanna decide? OPEN A BIZ.
@bloodless_coup @ChrisVanHollen They're free to spend THEIR money anyway they want. He's saying they just shouldn't get a tax break for it.
@bk5137 @ChrisVanHollen It's not a "break" to KEEP YOUR OWN F*CKING MONEY.  Hello?
@bloodless_coup @bk5137 @ChrisVanHollen The poor, slaves & middle class built 100% of the US. The 1% built NOTHING. #richparasites
@fullofbalogna @bk5137 @ChrisVanHollen You have a sick view of the world.
@bloodless_coup @bk5137 @ChrisVanHollen No, it's called justice & fairness. You want sociopaths to have the fruits of other's labors.
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi Too bad all the liberal Billionaires couldn't help the dems win their elections.  All $ in world can't help u.
.@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi perhaps without tax breaks, there would be no jobs.@FoxNews
@ChrisVanHollen corporations shouldn't get tax breaks PERIOD!
@ChrisVanHollen @mterry337 Golden parachutes for failed companies is no reward. Sounds more like a a bribe for the company to fail.
@ChrisVanHollen Whenever a corporation commits a crime ALL executives should pay huge fines. Now they're insulated from all accountability.
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi WARNING! Chris Van Hollen is back on Twitter. Everyone immediately take their anti-DUMB pill
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi That's None of My Business cause for Being BusinessMan, I Have Gave Mandates for Him.

@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi crony politicians and crony capitalists have created the large corps that overpay executives,you're the problem

@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi - u and nancy need to take some economic classes too know how business and the economy work
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi politicians shouldn't be able to vote themselves a raise either.

@ChrisVanHollen I have sent msg to Sen Sanders and tried to talk to various Free Speech talk shows and never even received a reply re: this
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi And congressmen shouldn't fly around in empty jets.
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi Explain why incompetent govt workers get raises when people who have successful businesses shouldn't.
@ChrisVanHollen @rosadelauro So the whole time Obama was in office, google, microsoft, facebook all paid an average of 2.4% in taxes.
@ChrisVanHollen A little pandering and class warfare there Chris?  nice
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi Hey dopes-the "break" is a business expense, and the bonus is taxed at a high rate.Nanc, what's your net worth?
@ChrisVanHollen @HouseDemocrats They shouldn't get tax breaks for that PERIOD! The taxpayers end up footing the bill for lost revenue!
@ChrisVanHollen @RepBarbaraLee Have either of you signed the FRONT of a payroll check? Bullshit politics..
@ChrisVanHollen @RepBarbaraLee Enough with divisive politics.. You're out next. #p2 #tcot
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi Keep going!! Eventually you will all be out of office. We don't want this socialist B.S.
@ChrisVanHollen Amen to that!
@ChrisVanHollen Congress shouldn't get all the tax funded perks like:lobbyists on payroll, healthcare for life, or 1st class flights
@NancyPelosi @ChrisVanHollen and Congress shouldn't get raises until the American people are back to work.
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi // does that apply to govt bonuses? Sadly you show you don't know how business works. Study on it & tweet again
@NancyPelosi @ChrisVanHollen NANCY your this is the PROBLEM! IT'S NOT GOVT POSITION TO TELL PRIVATE BUSINESS HOW TO USE IT ASSETS.
@ChrisVanHollen Give me one reason any INCOME TAX is MORAL?
Tax consumption...not income.
@ChrisVanHollen @Petapup1 oops a Teapottie is on the scene. see see see

@ChrisVanHollen hey liberal assholes why not tell us what we cando in our homes? Itching to ban smoking in homes eh you fascist shits?
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi So the House minority loser wants to determine corporate saleries when she does not even deserve minimum wage !
@ChrisVanHollen @LarryOConnor @ChrisPlanteShow @MichaelSteele a bit of marxism from libs who don't understand what business expenses are
@meanbits @ChrisVanHollen   It's called a tax deduction for a business expense.
@ChrisVanHollen @HouseDemocrats corporations are free 2 pay whatever they like-it doesn't mean we have to give them a tax break-Tax Reform!!
@ChrisVanHollen @HouseDemocrats How many members of cong. benefitted from VISA IPO?  We know @NancyPelosi did.
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi move to North Korea if you have a problem with that
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi who the hell are you decide what a business expense is? Pay is deductible bc it is a business expense
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi True. But it will not happen.
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi Why double taxation? CEO pay tax on bonuses!  Theft by Washington, DC, VanHollen and Pelosi.
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi I agree. If there is a minimum wage. Why is there not a maximum wage?
@ChrisVanHollen @HouseDemocrats That kind of mindless drivel is why your pathetic party LOST Tuesday!
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi, True, let us think of each other and be fair. It's not about being socialist but considerate.
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi Besides that who are the MORONs that voted and let these breaks happen in the first place. You idiots in #DC
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi And since when do clowns like oyu get to decide how corp function & pay ppl
@ChrisVanHollen @HouseDemocrats maybe, but we should stop the tax loopholes and use a simple flat tax. What say you?
@ChrisVanHollen @HouseDemocrats you should take control of dccc
@ChrisVanHollen Ironic advice from a guy who was part of a Gov't that spent over a TRILLION taxpayer dollars on a website that doesn't work.
@ChrisVanHollen
Founders didn't tax WORKERS.
TheirPlan:
1. Tax COMMERCE
2. Spend on Debt
3. Spend of Defense
4. Spend on Welfare
Let's do it
@ChrisVanHollen Democrats are driving businesses from Maryland. Voters elected a GOP guv for a reason. Lower taxes, fewer BS regs, rain tax?
@c_cgottlieb That is a stupid comment. Of course you have zero proof. Blue states are donor states. Red states are moochers. Stupid RWers.
@ChrisVanHollen this is written as if the Dems will have a majority in 2015; unfortunately the Repubs expanded their lead; USA is screwed
@Spazaru @ChrisVanHollen USA has been screwed for 6 years under Dems.  Republicans will fix it
