@WhiteHouse Chris Mintz asked is people were Christians before he shot them!
@DWLuttrell @WhiteHouse He asked them all what they believed in, then shot them. But you have to make it just a Christian thing. Ignorant!
@_whooty_ @DWLuttrell @WhiteHouse he did ask them if they were Christian!  Evil doers hate Jesus and those who love him!
@_whooty_ @highin_love316 @WhiteHouse Gunman Targeted Christians http://www.christianheadlines.com/blog/oregon-college-shooter-specifically-targeted-christians.html …
@DWLuttrell @highin_love316 @WhiteHouse He also identified as a conservative republican.
@_whooty_ @DWLuttrell @WhiteHouse Show me where Jesus taught to harm other's?  History proves godless sinners do sinful thing's
@highin_love316 @DWLuttrell @WhiteHouse Convert or die was their motto.
@WhiteHouse the last theater shooter was a member of the Westboro Baptist church founded by a Democrat!
@DWLuttrell @WhiteHouse yes stats show violent people vote Democrat.  ISIS would vote for the anti Jesus party.
@WhiteHouse Um..background checks? Sounds like y'all need better computer systems.
@MaryStewart01 @WhiteHouse Private sales are legal in some states. Woman in Maine killed recently, during a gun sale. No background needed.
@WhiteHouse Republicans enable criminals!
@WhiteHouse despicable using Islamic terrorism to attack people's constitutional rights.  God knows you turn a blind eye to evil!
@WhiteHouse the Tsarnaev brother's family were classified as refugees and were seeking asylum in the US. They were two Chechnyan Moslums.
@WhiteHouse Most if not all of the people doing the mass shootings are gun control advocates!
@DWLuttrell @WhiteHouse no, it's mostly people who don't trust the govt.
@WhiteHouse @moriartydg 

Because "current law" says U can't deprive someone of their rights based on suspicion. Sure U want to change that?
@rathernotsay @WhiteHouse I don't want fools with guns shooting others..PISSED OFF FORMER AUTOWEAPONS SPEC
@moriartydg 

Agree. Firearm permit s/b like drivers lic.: written test & skill test. Probably more gun deaths from incompetence than evil.
@WhiteHouse @wolfiemouse it's time
@WhiteHouse the democrats want the terrorists to come here, talk to the democrats
@WhiteHouse What a load of BS. A large percentage of people (Ted Kennedy, toddlers, etc) on the No-Fly List have no connection to terrorism.
@WhiteHouse @MsRock4Ever only part of the problem..we have allowed over 300000000 guns many in the hands of irresponsible people..STUPIDITY
@WhiteHouse shame on you for pushing this blatant lie me president.
@WhiteHouse. I
@WhiteHouse how do you determine who is a possible terrorist?  That's the main problem.
@WhiteHouse there is no possible way unless u r Donald Trump
@WhiteHouse @Texans4Bernie sorry, I do not trust who 'they' choose to put on this list - you cannot trust the congress
@WhiteHouse We should require them to register as terrorist. They are not terrorist until AFTER they kill someone.
@WhiteHouse @CynIscep not subscribed to partisan legislation tho tbch
@WhiteHouse 

38% of a 105 record sample contained inaccuracies.
Of course, that's actually pretty good by your standards, huh?
.
@WhiteHouse @NancyPelosi to all, pls note they are already expanding from 'no fly' to a much broader list.
@WhiteHouse the NRA opposes this law because it violates the 4th amendment. No person may be deprived of life, liberty, or Property
.@WhiteHouse @NancyPelosi
So ur Guilty Until Proven Innocent terrorist list prevents gun ownership then u believe right to vote's also void?
@WhiteHouse @NancyPelosi it's time for u dumbass #libtards to stop letting them in here in the 1st place! Don't blame GOP, it's YOUR fault!
@WhiteHouse

 Who's gonna stop
this enraged jihadi-fascist;
named: Erdogan ?!
►►http://nyti.ms/1Hls8GH

@WhiteHouse 

"Erdogan—has become
a significant part of the problem,
rather than part of the solution"
►►
@MumtazCeltik @WhiteHouse 'has become' - more like Putin shed the light on that rat
Wouldn't the NRA get angry if congress did try to protect take guns away from the crazies?
@WhiteHouse Checking gun buyers against the no-fly list is regressive and wrong. Even the ACLU wants the no-fly list terminated. #dueprocess
@WhiteHouse @ChrisVanHollen offer a clean bill pertaining to this problem instead of tacking on additional gun control, & it will pass.
@WhiteHouse @oonasez. This should not even come up for debate. Common sense says you dont help arm potential terrorists by selling them guns
@judydchandler you're right, unbelievable that it's not a done deal
@WhiteHouse I can't RT this defeatist stuff. What upside-down world are we in where we have to beg to not arm terrorists? Gun control NOW.
@etamny @WhiteHouse you realize that's literally what the American government does? Yet you support disarming citizens? Sheesh
@Einherion @WhiteHouse Yes I completely and totally support disarming citizens. Let your guns go.
@etamny @WhiteHouse Well 1. Nice blocking of alt opinions. Echo chambers are healthy. /s 2. I take it you are not American.
@WhiteHouse that statement could have been worded in a manner so as not to appear so partisan. Disappointing.
@WhiteHouse absolutely agree
@WhiteHouse it's time for #POTUS to be honest about terrorism. I will not surrender 2A to terrorists.
@WhiteHouse so they were on the terror watchlist and it never was workplace violence?!
@WhiteHouse omg, sotp this already.  The republicans are your fellow americans, not the enemy, that's ISIS dudes. what a bunch of idiots u r
@WhiteHouse they are terrorists, criminals. They don't buy Firearms at gun stores, they steal them or get them from obama and Holder
@WhiteHouse @mightyones1968 Problem is Obama is using list also as a Political hit list.  He put republicans on just because he could.
@WhiteHouse @gabaldon_a No!
@WhiteHouse @MiceeMouse It's time for concerned citizens 2 responsibly arm themselves.  No more soft targets.  God given right 2 self defend
@WhiteHouse @NancyPelosi here's a better question - why the HELL are terror suspects even here!!????
@WhiteHouse @NancyPelosi The problem is you will label us all terrorists #NDAA2012
.@WhiteHouse This legal? What due process safeguards are in place for people who are put on the list erroneously? #guncontrol is needed.
@WhiteHouse what happens if someone is mistakenly on list. Where is due process of citizens.
@WhiteHouse they weren't even terror suspects. That is admitted in the LA Times. We need Radical Islam control not gun control.
@WhiteHouse It's not a "loophole." It's called Due Process and is codified in the Constitution. You know, the thing you never read...
@WhiteHouse @NancyPelosi But what about those who don't show up on any list.  Like this muslim jackass, in San Bernardino??
@WhiteHouse If they're terror suspects what are they doing free?  Oh that's right, silly due process.
@WhiteHouse were the San Bernardino shooters on the terror watch list?
@WhiteHouse @JDodd59 Yea, but half of the people on the terror watch lists aren't terrorists.
@WhiteHouse If they are on the list I don't even want the them here
@WhiteHouse San Bernardino attackers were not on Terror Watch List.
@WhiteHouse @driverminnie I have a CHL & firearms & I agree that a license involving a background check should be mandatory 4 gun purchase's
@WhiteHouse @evanwhitney this is too funny, there are ways to get guns without buying them - any criminal can get a gun
@WhiteHouse @RiggLori Is this the same WhiteHouse headed by the guy who refuses to say "Islamic Terrorist" & considers white Xtians suspect?
@WhiteHouse terror watch list includes many Americans who aren't terrorists, but true Americans. America fails because government fails us.
@WhiteHouse @cberrl I also agree that the lazy Dems need to get off their butts and vote in the primaries and get & them out of office.
@WhiteHouse 3006 days waiting the dept of state & INL pay me 5 millions reward & the s visa offered by one of 10 most wanted  by the FBI
@WhiteHouse Time to stop your damn politics and get the Islamic terrorists out of America.
@WhiteHouse @arctichamster They Won't because Almost All Of Them R N The Pockets Of The NRA!! Gun Manufacturers!!
@WhiteHouse @southerntalker I like that gun nuts want their most feared enemies to have guns too; seems fair.
@PatriciaRaye If you're in a movie theatre and a crazed gunman starts shooting you'd be appreciative if a civilian with a gun defended you
@WhiteHouse @driverminnie innocent until proven guilty
@WhiteHouse @Politics_PR a lot of people on the lists are activists, tho, who have nothing to do with terrorism.
@WhiteHouse @Politics_PR lol.. #WorldPeace #2ndAmendment
@WhiteHouse it's time to prevent #republicansincongress from being able to buy a gun #realdangers
@WhiteHouse  Don't let Unknown refugees in and admit we have a problem with radical Islamic terrorism.
.@WhiteHouse @warrenleightTV Maybe the NRA and government should prevent everyone from buying a firearm. Maybe that would be a nice start.
@WhiteHouse @driverminnie well... it's a baby step, a premature baby step but let's call it SOMETHING... now lets see them not even do this!
@WhiteHouse The real terrorism will happen when all the refugees show up from the middle east, courtesy of Obama and the left wing nuts.
@WhiteHouse How about putting a stop to Obama's agenda, that's allowing terrorist into the United States via his immigration policy.
@WhiteHouse some people on the watch list are on there by accident. Their name is the same as a terrorist suspect. Be real ffs!
@WhiteHouse @driverminnie I understand the sentiment but there are people on the Terror Watch list simply because they have clearances
@WhiteHouse @driverminnie i.e. if Joe Smith has a Top Security Clearance because he's a contractor he's on the list
@WhiteHouse @socueme What is the criteria for being on a Watch List?
@_ROTE_ @WhiteHouse good question
@WhiteHouse @KatEdmiston it's time to incarcerate Republicans
@WhiteHouse GOP senate & House should return all the moneys the NRA gifted you them. Sit down, Pass a Gun control bill. Make America SAFE.
@WhiteHouse  come on.
@WhiteHouse Only if they are convicted of being a terrorist by a jury - u could put anyone you don't agree with on the watch list - too easy
@WhiteHouse @AQ1Miller horrible tone deaf tweet
@billeniumbeach if I understand what you are responding to you think it is tone deaf to call for closing gun loopholes today. I disagree.
@AQ1Miller No I am for 2A repeal by any means. The WH makes sympathetic noises and does nothing -all that was missing was email sign up form
@WhiteHouse 

STOP  INCENDIARY RHETORIC!!!

No wonder these things happen when the president and his sheep consistently preach this hate.
@WhiteHouse 

RT if you agree Barack Obama should stop allowing terrorists into our country.
@WhiteHouse again, you choose to single out republican as a problem rather than a solution. Let's continue the isolation.
@WhiteHouse it's time to stop letting terror suspects into the United States
Nothing makes sense anymore. And you're all making all that money..SMH...@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse it's time for the so called President to protect the people!!!
@WhiteHouse Better idea: It's time for the Democrat in the White House to stop letting terrorists into the country!
@WhiteHouse exactly how do you qualify who is on the terror watch list? Rights require due process.
@WhiteHouse what other inalienable rights should we give up without being convicted of anything? If they are being watched what's the risk?
@WhiteHouse @Everytown  Time for #gunsense laws. #ThisIsHome
@WhiteHouse U have armed #ISIS & #ISISinAmerica. You're worse.
@WhiteHouse of course the democrats want to completely disarm all citizens
@WhiteHouse NO! Government can put ANYONE on the list & not tell us why. No trial, no charges, Unconstitutional! We are not fools!
@WhiteHouse Is it true? People on the terror watch list are allowed to buy guns?  Is that protecting Americans?
@WhiteHouse What are the standards for the watch list?
@WhiteHouse Telling. Those at the White House believe in removing rights w/out due process of law. 5th & 14th Amendment anyone?
@WhiteHouse yes we should prevent terror suspects from being able to own/purchase gun.
@WhiteHouse stupid if true
@WhiteHouse Yes, I can see where due process can be a real inconvenience for aspiring totalitarians.
@WhiteHouse we talking about a terror list or no fly list? There are many law abiding citizens on no fly list. Already illegal 4 terrorist
@WhiteHouse agree !!!!!
@WhiteHouse if you had your way about no one would be able to buy guns
@WhiteHouse rather stop immigrants from voting but you wont budge on that so NO to any new laws on guns
@WhiteHouse suddenly this is an issue?  Was it an issue when the Democrats controlled both houses of Congress?
@WhiteHouse How about stopping #Obama from importing his #jihadi buddies?
@WhiteHouse It's time for Repubs to stand up to #tyranny.  Hands off the #constitution!
@WhiteHouse @NancyPelosi We need punishment for illegal alien criminals and penalties for sanctuary cities.
@WhiteHouse And how these terror suspects got into this country to begin with?
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse RT if you agree: it's time to tell democrats in congress to stop importing terrorists.
@WhiteHouse  Time for Americans to get real in ever so many arenas, In my view, we're verging on the Ding Bat cliff in far too many ways.
@WhiteHouse I agree with this post.
@WhiteHouse @TimFullerton Pardon my French, but WTF?!
@purrcat1 crazy isn't it?!?!
@WhiteHouse ... because enough anti-self-defense Democrats can get elected to take away all guns
@WhiteHouse 'not enough'
@WhiteHouse it's also time for some due process on that list then. How and why are folks sentence me to it without trial or appeal?
@WhiteHouse It's time for @POTUS to quit exploiting mentally challenged people's actions to promote his anti-gun bigotry
If they are terror suspects, @WhiteHouse, they should be in GITMO where weapons aren't allowed.
Is there research that shows firearms used in crimes were legally purchased by terror suspects along the way?

@WhiteHouse
It's hard to get serious #GunControl taken seriously w/so many unserious proposals by Democrats. 

@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse should provide link to law in order to validate the cited short coming, improving validity of intention.
@WhiteHouse only 1 year left of this bullshit.
@WhiteHouse I guess the 5th and 14th amendments no longer apply...
@WhiteHouse That's the other thing! WHY will GOP NOT chg gun laws so TERRORISTS CAN'T have guns? WHY? You preach guns provide guns ppl die!
.@WhiteHouse haha excellent. Slippery slope @NRA. What do you do with this one?
@WhiteHouse wtf
@WhiteHouse $689 billion defense budget +black money. Obscene. Melt all the weapons and make farm implements
@PaulRigas @WhiteHouse Including those weapons used to protect the president and his family?
@WhiteHouse 
its a big loophole to anti socials....
@WhiteHouse it would just end up being a loop hole for the government to grab guns, we'd all me terrorist eventually. Idiots.
@WhiteHouse Terrorists don't care about gun control laws. Just ask France. 
#WakeUpAmerica Gun control doesn't prevent crime.
@WhiteHouse that is the stupidest thing I've heard in a while. People get put on a watch list "accidently" all the time.
@WhiteHouse Why is it always someone else' s fault, not yours and party's controlled both houses for many years.  Pathetic
@WhiteHouse @J_Friendly despite not having broken any laws, committing any civil offenses, or probable cause to act, deprive rights. GG
@ToddMDavid @WhiteHouse I'll figure out how to respond to this after some more info on today's mass shooting…
@J_Friendly @WhiteHouse any response that is pre-crime based need not be uttered.
@WhiteHouse hmh no sir. Watch list or not crazy gets a gun  when it wants. Look at you one job to do. And you can't pull that off.
@WhiteHouse - time for demos to follow the law and get rid of sanctuary cities
@WhiteHouse https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfP427nPSsE&feature=youtu.be …
@WhiteHouse it depends on what the criteria will be to be put on the list
@WhiteHouse how many liberals are on that Watchlist?
@WhiteHouse not if Americans, Veterans, Conservatives, and Patriots are populating said "Terror Watchlist"
@WhiteHouse Stupid! If criminals want guns, they will get guns. No gun control law is ever going to change that. Gun control: use 2 hands.
@WhiteHouse @DaveSiegler Innocent until proven guilty, just like non-citizen refugees. RT if you agree. #2A #NRA #tcot #PJNET #military
@WhiteHouse It's time for the government to leave us the fuck alone.
@Whitehouse it is called Due Process Rights. How many on the list got their day in court?
@whitehouse @chrisvanhollen Retweet if you agree that Democrats need to keep criminals in jail. #NRA #Guns
@WhiteHouse I'm confused: a background check reveals on the watch list, but the gov't wasn't doing anything to fix that? Seems bigger issue.
@WhiteHouse if there's full disclosure and vetting for that list, then yes. I doubt that's the plan though
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse not true, if the background ck shows your on a terror watch list, tell me who the next knock on their door will be!
@WhiteHouse NO TO TAKING AWAY ANY MORE RIGHTS!!!!
@WhiteHouse not suspects those with a hearing and opportunity to defend found guilty of inciting hatred
@WhiteHouse @NancyPelosi -Time for you to get rid of sanctuary cities
@WhiteHouse -how about you getting rid of sanctuary cities
@WhiteHouse @NancyPelosi RT if you think that people who are here illegally shouldnt be able to get government benefits get on it Democrats!
@WhiteHouse impossible ... Just don't be easy with the trigger finger...we all have our likes n dislike ppl#
@WhiteHouse Absolute nonsense. Restrict access to nothing. Ever.
@WhiteHouse THAT IS INSANE, OF COURSE THEY SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TOO BUY WEAPONS!!! IS THIS SOMETHING YOU NEED TOO THINK ABOUT?????
@WhiteHouse can't stop it laws don't apply to criminals.
@whitehouse @ctdems The fact we must convince them of this speaks volumes. #NoLogic #NoCommonSense
@WhiteHouse @Everytown Can anyone in the C O N - gress tell me what to do or who to call in the event of a terrorist attack?
@whitehouse it's time 4 #Democrats&#Republicans 2 stop being #corporatist,#statist,#zionist #NATO #terrorists#StopNATO #StandWithRand
@WhiteHouse @CTDems I think it is time to secure our borders keep terrorist out of the country; start with that
@WhiteHouse @rosadelauro Why mislead? Watch list triggers red flag in NICS. Background check MUST be passed to buy gun?
@WhiteHouse @rosadelauro It’s time for Dems to stop trying to violate right to due process of innocent people on your bloated list #ACLU
@WhiteHouse
  اسمعو شوفولنا حل مع #سهيله_بن_لشهب والله يا سطاراك دارو فيهاالباطل ايماجين راهم حابسينها في سبيطار علابالي نتوم كونطر لعنصرية
