This @USCBO report should be the final nail in the coffin for Trumpcare.
It’s nothing more than a Trojan Horse for tax cuts to rich, while stripping affordable care from millions.
It’s not a plan to improve health care in America—it’s a way to game the system in favor of the wealthy.
.@POTUS and @SenateGOP's attempt to discredit the @USCBO analysis is a desperate attempt to hide the truth from the American people.
let add a column for # of those strong armed into buying insurance or paying fine.
Time for pushing #singlepayer
you have my support as you vote today!
please don't let their travesty of a 'healthcare' pass!
do U have any idea how many, other than Medicaid, can no longer afford premiums OR R U so dense....????
standing firmly behind you
2 things needed; let Medicare & VA work together to negotiate drug prices & let seniors use drug co. savings programs.
You have no evidence that that those figures are accurate. Another liberal fortuneteller.
Had a great HealthCare system b4 ACA/ObamaCare that destroyed it & inflated Medicaid figures:FedUp with your & Democrat LIES
as long as we're able to cut taxes for people making $10 million dollars a year I think it's worth it.
People perish for lack of knowledge. Thank you.
Please make sure all Democrats coming up for re-election understand. Americans don't want dysfunctional Trumpcare. Thanks.
how many of those were forced to buy insurance they did not want in the first place.
sad state of affairs!!! Walk over the dead and sick?
Ty Sir! Keep fighting for America! 
2030  Daddy, tell me again what insurance was like.
U r a very deceitful Progressive Marxist Democrat hellbent on destroying the USA-Eviscerating US constitution & oathofoffice
You are foolish!
Unacceptable!! 24k thrown off is a death sentence for many.
Nobody is being thrown off! This is the number of people who were forced to buy OCare and who will now opt out.
No one should have to "opt out" because they can't afford health care. Health care should be a right not a choice.
Many people, esp young, healthy people want to opt out. They should have that right w/o paying a huge penalty.
I understand.  But u need young healthy people to keep premiums low.  If it's only old sick people, it won't work
1) So you think the gov should *force* people to buy something they don't want?
It would be interesting to see how many of those who "don't want health care" would sign up if it were free. Illness has no as age or gender
I'm sure they all would if it were free. But the young blissfully take their health and fitness for granted.
VOTE for Repeal of Obamacare! It stinks! We need change &choice! Don't vote partisan-vote for better health care4Americans!
its called TrumpDoesntCare
follow federal law vanHollen women are getting raped
Scare tactics. Stop listening to Chuck Schumer.
FREE single payer=gas/$6gal-caseBud/$50-Stoli$40-18%tax on food& groceries&services.SLOW care U DECIDE
your wrong about Trump supporters as a former Democrat I support him100% ,Your obstruction

@ProgressiveXX why cant US understand if u keep every one healty and rich People Pay more tax u get teamwork and rich USA
Why are we ignoring Ryan's involvment? We should call it TRyAn Care
@realDonaldTrump #trumpcare
For what it's worth, Politico has reported the WH has an internal estimate of 26M, though the WH is disputing that.
@BrianFrosh where were you when obama violated constitutional rights ?! #hypocrite
@SenateDems What about #trumprussia #traitortrump? What is this new deadline?  #persist #resist #win
@SPeitsch         Nazicare: 
1933 → ZERO uninsured
Castrocare: 
1967 → ZERO uninsured
SovietUnionCare: 
1972 → ZERO uninsured
@NormEisen Trumpcare. Oxymoron.
24 million MORE...so over 55 million
how many of those are uninsured by choice? You only support choice when it is killing the innocent.
Please go on record opposing Trump care.  And stop Pruitt from destroying EPA and the US.  #unbelievable
Yep, MILLIONS don't want govt insurance rammed down their throats by ACA
@SenatorCardin @TheDemocrats @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats What will u do 2 stop #Trumpcare? Seeing outrage & not much action.
@SenateDems as a foreigner not an American, I always hoped Americans continue saving their future. Now they should balance.
thank you for being present.
Fix ACA. Dont rob the health of the less fortunate to put more $$$ in the pockets of the rich and greedy.  Disgraceful
Its amazing how willing the GOP is to sacrifice other people's health but never their own.  Shameless.
@NormEisen you're ignoring increased access to #thoughtandprayers for those facing this attack on America by @gop agents ;)
2018 is in nine months

@cdelbrocco And it just doesn't matter to the GOP.

@BrianFrosh This is bogus. You have no way of calculating these figures.
@NormEisen so right back to where we started in 09 essentially, but with some tax cuts
Are you counting the increased death rate in that?
@NormEisen Repub's don't care. Why? Because health ins will be available. Not affordable, just available.
NOT "winning"
Then will you support a Senate version of HR676 then? #everyoneinnobodyout
@NormEisen inhumane.
@NormEisen Trumpcare-LESS
aka DonTCare
@NormEisen america first in people dying without insurance.
USA.USA.USA. 
@GOP slogan, tax breaks for the rich.
@NormEisen killing of the lower and middle class one American at a time. Mass genocide with one stroke of a pen.
Because they choose not to buy insurance. That is how a Republic works. In a Democracy the Gov dictates what people should buy.
No, because they can't afford to buy it. (I'll skip your ignorance about Republic vs Democracy.)
Instead of 'Making America Great Again,' #Trumpcare will make America uninsured again.
I turn 60 this year and would be among the first to lose my healthcare from cuts to Medicaid. #TrumpCareKills
@SenateDems Health insurance is a benefit not a right.
@jentaub news media: "this is hard headline for Republicans to combat" no shit, Sherlock!
except that by 2026, many of those will already be dead
@JoeTrippi U fail 2 disclose lrg % drop in insured is people who NEVER wanted insurance but were req'd  2 purchase w/Ocare
how many were uninsured before the ACA?
@JoeTrippi why have insurance if you CAN'T keep your doctor!?!?!
That can't be a serious question.
Hard to like these numbers #TrumpDon'tCare
and neither do I ... too many people milking the system. Rather contribute to the people that really deserve it.
@JoeTrippi all voluntarily as they sign up for other coverage... you guys are real liars.
@SenateDems tell everyone why uninsured! Not forced to buy ins! Will drop out and spend HC tax credit on pot and cell phones
@SenateDems Not knowing the end GOP healthcare result and making projections out to 2026 priceless. #realDonaldTrump
@SenateDems ACA said 24000000 would b insur by 2016. Only 10,500,000 r. Some by FORCE because of ACA. Not by will.
@SenateDems That's because we won't be FORCED anymore to have it like u did to us.
@SenateDems tell those 24 million to get a JOBBBBBBB and pay for their OWNNNNNN
it's morally wrong. I can hear my dad now.
.@stephenro88
24 MILLION   THAT NUMBER WILL DROP WHEN WE ARE DONE DEPORTING THE 22 MILLION   THIS WAS 10 YEARS AGO
@mcolfer7
That's 52 million uninsured in 2026
@SenateDems Making up the news? Only 11 million on obamacare, how could 24 million lose it? #FactCheck #FakeNewsAlert
What does "being on Obamacare" mean?
@SenateDems not much of a replacement.
@SenateDems your attempt at taking over 18% of GDP is losing
.@The_Bull_1
can this be reversed in 2018 if Trump is gone and Dems do well in Elections
@SenateDems WE ALREADY LOST OUR INSURANCE IN ARIZONA.....UNDER OBAMACARE
Rep voting for trumpcare needs to decline Gov health insurance & sign up for their party's shitty trump care plan! @ChrisVanHollen @Gop
Numbers are likely too high. You're failing to factor in how many will die beforehand because of substandard coverage.
So you're really admitting Republican changes would only risk 10mil new uninsured (via gov't), not 24M as libs trending?
You pushed Obamacare thru and destroyed the system. That's why you lost! Try working with President Trump to fix your mess!
If you have insurance and cannot aford the co-pay that equals no insurance
Probably all the immigrants that dont pay into the system.  Send them home
2030 ----- 38 million unalive
Why are you worring? Will you be one?

the American tax payer can't afford welfare system anymore.
This is a prime example of why I didn't vote for you. This is the most imbecilic projection by a novice government employee I have ever seen
The numbers are from the CBO.
it's their choice it says it in the report that for ppl it won't make economic sense
14 million? how bout tell the truth most of them won't receive insurance by choice. They pay the fine bc they don't want it.
I live/work in . The most expensive thing you'll ever encounter is FREE healthcare
ACA is like the Titanic, sinking, yet you are claiming everyone will benefit by staying onboard. Career pol's resist change.
thank Marco Rubio for undermining it. Perfect? No. Fixable? Yes. Trumpcare isn't the fix
And what about Obamacare stats, @ChrisVanHollen? How many are paying outrageous premiums but w/HUGE deductibles, can't afford to use it?
And what about those on Obamacare that HAVE lost & are losing their insurance? And those with only 1 insurance provider?
Fight Senator!!! Proud of my elected officials!
keep your doctor and plan and save $2500 a year.. remember that whopper?
but they'll have *access* to it.
