When you Trumpites have no health insurance who will you vote for? The GOP Congress is working to give the corporations & rich tax breaks!
lies. BTW WHEN  they start handing out punishment for this campaign BS then Obama MUST charged  as he interfered on Israel election
You guys completely screwed up healthcare and now it's YOU who refuse to negotiate at all, except more bailouts,  GROW UP
Trump EPA Administrator Promises to Clean Up Toxic Waste Sites Obama Left Behind

We should take these billboards back to D.C. & hang them all over the beltway to Rte 95 
Obama intentionally set up ACA knowing it would fail so he could convert to single payer system.
Most of the insurers dropped out BEFORE Congress did anything! Obama sat on his ass for 8 yrs. letting it fail intentionally!

Put the blame where it belongs @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump has read nothing abt the health care bill
Put the blame where it belongs Obama Care
GOP=101 Amendments to ACA
It's GOP care

So yes I blame it
Because of how the GOP
ruined Americans' access
to healthcare
Blame it on the GOP
Why did Obama sign it then?
America is a Democratic Republic with checks and balances. Read your history and try and keep up.

Believe The Lie.
hahaha what affordable plans! The market dictates  cost and its collapsing. You passed Obamacare knowing it would collapse!

MORE FAKE NEWS... WHEN DO YOU STOP. WE LOOK LIKE FOOLS OVERSEAS AND IT YOU AND ALL LIBERALS CAUSING THIS  BS. STOP NONSENSE
Protect children from sex offenders like #Democrat Anthony Weiner and racists like @RobertGBeckel
We who elected President Trump, will remember his opposition when we vote.
Trump and his cronies "making it fail". 
Breaking the LAW!
Its been slowly dying for years and you have done nothing about it. It didn't just start failing because of trump
The Republican Party is America's death panel.
2. Affordable plans like AETNA HAVE BEEN DRIVEN OUT OF THE MARKET ALREADY BY FAILED OBAMA CARE. IT IS FRANKLY TOO EXPENSIVE FOR HC INSURERS!
4. There are NO PLANS which will remain under OCARE/ACA under existing trends. It has been a failure since its inception!Only needy sign up
This is another example of democratic lies: 
1. ACA IS FIXED BY ACHA.
2. Bipartisan support was sought by reps but demwits are oppositional!
Maybe YOU should have thought about that bipartisanship when you crammed that piece of crap law on the country
Dear Dems...America just wants to let you know..Your attempted ooup of our @POTUS WILL BE IN VAIN..YOU HAVE TO COME THRU ALL OF US..
They want ACA dead. Don't care who suffers because of their vengeance.
You put out false crap and expect 
people to buy it.
At least they ARE doing something.......Democrats not doing a damned thing to help the legal citizens!!!!!
ACA already drove affordable plans and insurers out of the market. Where have u Dems been for the last 8 years?
& You lollygaggin libtard freaks are clueless frigging commys who hate private sector profit & are out to grow gov for total control 
lies your health care that you were counting on failing so you could hand us single payer plan did not work so move on
Ha! Dems are crying and doing nothing! You're hurting America way more by doing nothing. Practice what you preach and go back to the table!
Dems locked GOP out of construction. Dems designed ACA to fail to get single payer system. Now ur work is imploding and u want GOP help?
You shoved a POS down our throats! Simple why not try to work with them stop complaining and do something slugs

Stop sabotaging & fix #Obamacare. #trumpcare is a Russian smart bomb and you know it. @FBI knows bad policies are being launched to hurt USA 
Yeah, why can't they work in a bi partisan way like you did?  Elections have consequences. Remember???  Cut the crap!
America.
Who said, you said.
You keep saying bipartisanship but you only want it your way. 
Nothing new here. Repubs have been undermining ACA/Obamacare since it passed and was enacted into law. Make them stop. Elect Dems.
ACA is dead. Move on.
This could use an apostrophe in "Americans".  "Lower Americans" sounds descriptive.  Try "lower American's"
What insurers are left?
What a REVOLUTIONARY IDEA! Work together to provide to constituents what they need, instead of pointing fingers and blame elsewhere.PROFOUND
HUGE lies.

#lies #RealReform
Dems passed ACA without a single Republican vote.
Not quite sure why R's are on a trajectory to ruin their chances to EVER be reelected. Every constituency of  America is being affected.
Stop lying to us. 18 of 23 insurers left before Trump was even elected. GOP is not doing anything. ACA is imploding on its own.
Not with you stupid democratic, no, no, and hell no!
I can't afford your kind of care nor the deductible. We haven't had insurance since obamacare started, & don't qualify for medicaid! So NO!
Not so simple - ACA is dying if not dead.  Democrat crafted a crappy solution taking from some and giving to others - no one benefitted
Why not single payer? Better than #obamacare #aca. Super simple stuff
Instead of working in a bipartisan way to achieve Single Payer HC, Senate Dems spent 1/4-1/2 of their time courting re-election funds.
