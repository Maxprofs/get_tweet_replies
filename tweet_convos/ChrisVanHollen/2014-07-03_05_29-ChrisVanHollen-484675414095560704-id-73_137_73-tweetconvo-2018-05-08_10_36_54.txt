@ChrisVanHollen I totally agree.
@KMAllmond Why? All this does is increase cost of goods produced, which means that u pay their taxes.
@DMH_FZ As opposed to paying for their food stamps because their employers are too greedy?
@KMAllmond Who defines greed? Have you ever owned a business?
@DMH_FZ Seriously? Are you a Walton?
@KMAllmond Dead serious. Are you an American? Have you ever worked for a private company?
@DMH_FZ What does that have to do with my being an American? We all know corporations don't pay what their tax rate is. End of conversation.
@KMAllmond Because it is obvious u don't understand a thing about business and if u live in this country it is a critical vein of freedom.
@ChrisVanHollen just another burden on citizens. Economics 101.
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi whats a fair share 50%? While your friends at GE pay nothing, lib dems need frontal lobe surgery
.@ChrisVanHollen .@NancyPelosi More taxes eh? Why not cut the spending to foreign countries that want to kill Americans? #DOOFUS
@ChrisVanHollen what do YOU think a fair share is when it comes to a business tax? @nancypelosi
@Cowboy__Country @ChrisVanHollen That would be whatever @NancyPelosi believes necessary to subsidize Paul Pelosi success in green energy.
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi Let's drive businesses out of California to states where they don't have to pay taxes. Nicely done twat.

@ChrisVanHollen @Sanddragger Corporations don't pay taxes, their customers do... Are you really that stupid?
@ChrisVanHollen Not enough people realize their tax dollars go to large corporations to subsidize the low wage, no benefit jobs "created."
@ChrisVanHollen Chris, let's start cutting spending in other areas.  Washington does not have a revenue problem, it has a spending problem.
@ChrisVanHollen Border agent:‘We’re not catching criminals,rapists,murderers, terrorists b/c we’re busy w child surge
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi

@ChrisVanHollen How does a corporation pay taxes? Does it grow arms & hand out money? Or do stock holders, customers & employees pay? Hmm..
@ChrisVanHollen Make corporate tax competitive and stop double taxation on foreign profits so they can bring that money home, cut deficit!
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi Okay,as long as we do the same for all the illegals  allowed to enter our country by the WH and get benefits
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi "And when you ask them, 'How much should we give,' they'll only answer 'More! More! More!'"
@ChrisVanHollen If only such common sense abided amongst your Republican /Tea Party brethren/sisters
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi #FAIRTAX NOW NO LOOPHOLES!

By implication, you suggest they are not. Would this include Democrat donor/lobbying big corporations? @ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi
@ChrisVanHollen @RepDennyHeck 

Define fair share.

@ChrisVanHollen @HouseDemocrats How are you going to do that when Governor Como has programs for new business tax free 10 years forget Texas
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi ...if corporations are so bad why have you been giving them tax breaks & subsidies for generations. ..
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi 
USA currently has the highest Corp Income Taxes on Earth
why push more businesses away?
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi   What about the shovel ready jobs? How well did that work? 18,000,000.000,000
@ChrisVanHollen Huge!
@ChrisVanHollen US economy adds 288,000 jobs, pushes Dow Jones above 17,000. The prez has made tremendous progress despite GOP obstruction.
US.corporate tax burden is among highest in the world. What is their "fair share"? What morons: @ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi
@ChrisVanHollen How about starting with a Financial Transaction Tax (FTT) and raising Capital Gains to 30%! #Inequality #FTT
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi They are already paying more than there fair share, so think you need to kick in 95% of your income
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi You mean like you who doesn't pay your fair share. Just keep the #Lies coming No one belives anything you say.
@ChrisVanHollen @RepJoseSerrano THEN YOU'LL COLLECT LESS-WALGREENS IS ALREADY MOVING TO EUROPE.
@ChrisVanHollen You must mean "spend more". That's not working too well but like insanity keep trying. you will get the same results
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi Let's invest in our future by turning both chambers of congress over to the GOP.
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi Corp doesn't pay taxes peeps who buy products do,just another tax on consumers,stop wasteful spending,cronyism
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi every time these Dems raise our taxes the more we lose in economic growth. Where does it go? Aren't better off
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi our corp tax rate 2nd highest in world. We lose business growth by over taxing. why companies don't come here
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi corps pay more than fair share. Look at recent companies buying Irish businesses...so they can pay their rate
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi Cost of everything will go up: Corporations don't pay taxes, consumers do.
@ChrisVanHollen @kharyp I'm thinking a whole lot of ppl skipped literacy class. Hollen says to make sure corps pay taxes, not increase taxes
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi 35% (the highest among industrialized nations) isn't enough?! Is there no limit to Dems' tax mania?
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi if corps are not people then don't tax them at all.
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi Chris Van Hollen would be good house speaker don't ya think??
@ChrisVanHollen @UniteBlueWI and even refuse to send the police or other emergency services when they require them.
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi sad that there won't be anything to invest since you've spent the next three generations money!!!
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi Nancy you idiot, corporations already pay the highest rates. They are fleeing the US for other Country's.
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi because if companies are discouraged from hiring people then more handouts will be needed. Buying votes
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi fair share is socialist for 'until I say enough'. If you think corps are not people then don't tax them at all
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi The key to that goal is to dust off the Presidents Bills and fuckin pass them. All of them!
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi yeah lets tax more corps out of this country,  Walgreens is considering leaving how many more can we tax out
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi All you have to do is raise the highest rate in the world. That should chase more jobs overseas.
@ChrisVanHollen how about making everyone pay! It's not just corporations, 1/2 of Americans don't pay taxes either! #FixIt @NancyPelosi
@ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi That is an incredibly stupid statement.
@ChrisVanHollen We already have highest corp tax rate on the planet... Let's just spend what we have & not a penny more.
@ChrisVanHollen Can you discuss, specifically, what amount is "fair," without populist platitudes? Thanks.
@ChrisVanHollen RT a zillion times! US Constitution Budget: #1) TAX COMMERCE! #2) Fund Debt, Defense & Welfare
