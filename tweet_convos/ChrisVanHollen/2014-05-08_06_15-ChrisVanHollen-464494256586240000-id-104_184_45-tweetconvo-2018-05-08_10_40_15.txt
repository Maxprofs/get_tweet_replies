.@QuidProQuoTwo No. I don't like #LIARS no matter their gender, race or political party. EVERY American should be outraged by #Benghazi
@HouseDemocrats @Clyburn @SpeakerBoehner until @WhiteHouse had to release a clean copy of Rhodes e-mail #Benghazi #foia
@HouseDemocrats @RepLindaSanchez @SpeakerBoehner   Issa  out of line. Honor murdered Americans w decency. #Benghazi  not 4 fund raising.
@HouseDemocrats @Clyburn @SpeakerBoehner Because it was discovered that the WH suppressed evidence.
@HouseDemocrats @RepBecerra @SpeakerBoehner new evidence brings new action. BHO, HILLARY & RICE only need to come clean. Dems protect 'em
@HouseDemocrats Why do you suppose it took a court order to release the Rhodes email? Why wasn't it released with the other emails? Curious.
@Clyburn @HouseDemocrats You know very well why Boehner choose to form a S committee. That email shows Obama was complicit in a cover-up
@HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi  Boy you all have a poor memory. New emails remember and they weren't given to congress. You guys love to spin
Many thanks to FOIA for the change of heart. #ImpeachObama

@HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SpeakerBoehner Unless I am wrong, this was prior to finding the email that had been hidden by you fucks.
@Clyburn @HouseDemocrats  Did you NOT see the NEW email the WH had to release proving Obama& Hillary knew #Benghazi was not a YouTube video?
@HouseDemocrats @Clyburn @SpeakerBoehner After seeing Rhodes email & Vietor interview showing the WH has been lying. We need select comm
@HouseDemocrats @ChrisVanHollen @SpeakerBoehner that was b4 it was revealed that docs were withheld from subpoena.
@HouseDemocrats @Clyburn @SpeakerBoehner Perhaps the FACT that court forced release of previously hidden documents show WH lies matter-4died
@HouseDemocrats @Clyburn @SpeakerBoehner Never heard #term "New #evidence has come 2 #light"? Or would U rather continue 2 #ignore #truth?
.@HouseDemocrats You neglected to mention 'until the emails proved they all #LIED ' #Benghazi @NancyPelosi @SpeakerBoehner

@HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SpeakerBoehner until evidence showed WH blocking emails to cover up.  What are u so scared of??

@HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SpeakerBoehner    No more committees ! Stop beating this horse !
@HouseDemocrats @ChrisVanHollen @SpeakerBoehner Chris missed email jusdge ordered administration to turnover. Another dumocrat?
@HouseDemocrats @ChrisVanHollen @SpeakerBoehner GOP Benghazi watchdogs organized a gold-diggers funding team to go to the victims gravesites
@ChrisVanHollen @SpeakerBoehner  The Ghostbuster's  soundtrack. You want money from the dead? Who you gonna call? The GOP gold-diggers!
@ChrisVanHollen @SpeakerBoehner  Send the GOP money. Have your name added as a supporting member of the Benghazi gold-diggers fan club.

@HouseDemocrats @SpeakerBoehner #BitchinBoutBenghazi and #BashinObamacare are hard work and a full-time job for GOP
@HouseDemocrats @SpeakerBoehner he's afraid of Hillary and the ACA is working.
@HouseDemocrats @janschakowsky Public pressure on Boehner forced him to form a select committee. You are an embarrassment
@HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SpeakerBoehner most transparent Adm. ever. Not so much.!! #GOPMajorities
@HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SpeakerBoehner democrats acting mature would really b refreshing change, but  don't see that climate changing.
@HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SpeakerBoehner  and if you can't get your way u are going to take your ball and go home
@HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SpeakerBoehner  now that a committee is forming u want equal representation which goes against the public will
@HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SpeakerBoehner  let me explain something.  In the house American voters decided u 2 b the minority.
@HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SpeakerBoehner   He was foolish enough to think you would be forth coming enough that he wouldn't need one
@HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SpeakerBoehner yeah, it's amazing what a new, leaked document will do.
@HouseDemocrats @UniteBlueWI @SpeakerBoehner b/c groundswell & their donors are commanding a special committee...boehner & issa involved
@HouseDemocrats @UniteBlueWI @SpeakerBoehner
@HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SpeakerBoehner if you have nothing to hide then hand ALL e mails and documents. Your suppose to be transparent
@HouseDemocrats @SpeakerBoehner Could you please do something for the American people for a change? You accomplish NOTHING !!!!!!!
@HouseDemocrats @WhipHoyer Thank you for working so hard for the long term unemployed! It's not over until its passed though! Keep at it!!!!
@HouseDemocrats @SpeakerBoehner because now we have an email proving WH manipulated #Benghazi talking points #DUH !
@HouseDemocrats @Clyburn @SpeakerBoehner Because a email surfaced from the WH after Judicial Watch filed a FOIA request. Watch MSNBC!
@HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi Thank you for working so hard for the 3 mil unemployed. The suffering is getting worse. I lost my car today.
@HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SpeakerBoehner Because it is anything but the UI bill- so stop his bills and we are backing you!
@HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SpeakerBoehner That was before every1 realized libs were covering something up. Now we know u r.
@HouseDemocrats @SpeakerBoehner This quote was BEFORE  the BEN  Rhoades email,proving the WH added the video to shape the lying narrative.
@HouseDemocrats @WhipHoyer I am sure the new evidence the @WhiteHouse was hiding is the reason @SpeakerBoehner "evolved" in his position
@HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SpeakerBoehner The real question is, what are you trying to cover up? Gun running to terrorist? Zero footprint
@HouseDemocrats @SpeakerBoehner Americans still deserve a full investigation into those lies told to invade Iraq. How about backing that?
@HouseDemocrats @SpeakerBoehner Let 's see some strong reactions from House Dems. You all should be making some noise, not just complaining.
@HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SpeakerBoehner That was before the smoking gun White House emails.
@HouseDemocrats @SpeakerBoehner elections
@HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SpeakerBoehner Why is Nancy Pelosy and the bandwagon rattled by the Select Committee? Afraid of truth?
@HouseDemocrats @SpeakerBoehner He's only now finding a reason for the panel due to the fact he's no leader. He's being led by the Wing nuts
@HouseDemocrats @SpeakerBoehner @NancyPelosi #TBT to today when House Dems forgot about new #Benghazi emails
@HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SpeakerBoehner It is a shame to be under the control of men that use money as strings connected to puppets.
@HouseDemocrats @SpeakerBoehner:How much taxpayers money have the GOP wasted on this non-issue? Should Dems have hearings on the Iraq issue?
@HouseDemocrats @owillis @SpeakerBoehner Clinton'16
@HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SpeakerBoehner So What Do Democrats Fear About A Select Committee? Possibly The REAL TRUTH!
@HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SpeakerBoehner Maybe he thought one of U #Democrats would actually tell the #truth without being forced.
@HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SpeakerBoehner: Okay, Boehner said this, so why is he wasting taxpayers money on forming ANOTHER COMMITTEE?!
@HouseDemocrats @SpeakerBoehner but wouldn't let #Renewui in the house its our capitol we the ppl pay for
@31merk @HouseDemocrats The democrats didn't file the proper forms to secure the room as a hearing room They screwed up they know the rules
@scottfrantz2 @HouseDemocrats they could've LET em use it #Renewui
@31merk @HouseDemocrats not really due to rules they all have to follow when it comes to members only meetings
@scottfrantz2 O ok so they didnt no they were having guest?
@31merk read this story it kind of explains it
@scottfrantz2 ok I read it

@HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SpeakerBoehner Because the WH is lying! Shame on them! 4 People Died! #POTUSFAIL
@HouseDemocrats @SpeakerBoehner  That's because he's lacking principles and a spine.
@HouseDemocrats @SpeakerBoehner Obamacare is working, so it's not a credible taking point anymore....Benghazi is all they've got now.
@HouseDemocrats @SpeakerBoehner Don't be discouraged by unfair criticism. it should just make you determined to try even harder. sparkypath
@HouseDemocrats @SpeakerBoehner @adbridgeforth The speaker is too intoxicated 2 remember anything he says - he's a complete failure
@HouseDemocrats @SpeakerBoehner He saw no reason until he finally realized Obamacare was working & wouldn't help them in Nov.
@HouseDemocrats @SpeakerBoehner Never think your individual ideas don't matter. You may have one that will change the world. sparkypath
@HouseDemocrats @SpeakerBoehner Because he leans whichever way the flatulence blows! #leadersthatREFUSEtolead
@HouseDemocrats @SpeakerBoehne you're right on your decision against forming committees on Benghazi.Speak up more on  issues. sparkypath
@HouseDemocrats He still doesn't. Boehner's no leader; he just blows wherever teabag GOP and FOX news tells him to #COWARD @SpeakerBoehner
@HouseDemocrats @SpeakerBoehner Now their is a reason.
@PeterdiPierro @HouseDemocrats @SpeakerBoehner what is your involvement w/ groundswell  & their donors mr speaker & ISSA?
