@NancyPelosi how do you plan to force employers to not cut jobs and hours as a result of this?
@XRDSQT Why would employment budgets remain static? If a business can not succeed without exploitation, it has already failed.  @NancyPelosi
@DorianPlum @NancyPelosi ah yes! Exploitation. There it is. Spend a lot of time in the private sector? #obviouslynot
.@XRDSQT you assume that ignorance is the only reason for advocacy of a living wage?
@DorianPlum Raising the min wage WILL force job cuts. You can't legislate that it won't. Employers don't take risks to not earn a profit.
Yes, raising the minimum wage will always mean future job cuts. Odd how those cuts never seem to arrive with the future they occupy. @XRDSQT
@DorianPlum I support hard work and want to protect the real risk takers from oppressive govt. Libs don't understand cause & effect.
@XRDSQT of course we do The science is in The cognitive difference is cons can't cope with uncertainty or care about people in other groups.
@NancyPelosi #1010Means you get to change the subject on #Obamacare failures temporarily #RedHerring
@Keenerthanyou1 @NancyPelosi What failures? ACA is right in line with projections and is reducing costs. You are spreading propaganda
@Wooflepup u saying it's bringing down cost is the only propaganda. But we expect it from tools like you
@Keenerthanyou1 That's what serious economists have been saying for years. The stimulus effect balances the cost effects. Net wash.  Link:
@Wooflepup "serious economists?" You mean the Obama administration. Go Troll elsewhere. You're a lying tool.
@Keenerthanyou1 So you lost an argument. Boo hoo.
@Keenerthanyou1 Arguments require facts, evidence, reason. You are apparently incapable of bringing ANY of these things to the table.
@NancyPelosi #clueless
@NancyPelosi Economic Policy Institute is about as left wing as they come. Obama's OWN LABOR Department says this graphic is a lie.
@_donaldson @NancyPelosi what part of it is lie ? ive seen that world with my own eyes, thats most of the job market around here
@aliencackle @NancyPelosi All of it. 3% of the workforce makes minimum wage according to Department of Labor
@_donaldson @aliencackle @NancyPelosi their 3% is wrong, its a lot higher
@NancyPelosi @careerdiva Nancy, why not raise it to $25?
@NancyPelosi How many US workers earn the minimum age? And what's that as a % of the total work force?
@WolmacPartners @NancyPelosi most retail work at least, plus farming help, etc. , all lot of temp labor,
@NancyPelosi and millions of women would go on the dole as their employers automate or close. let the FREE market decide correct wages.
@moshek258 @NancyPelosi free market already failing that for too long
@aliencackle @NancyPelosi that's because the markets arn't free. Ever heard of the fed? or massive government regulation?
@moshek258 @aliencackle @NancyPelosi regs is doing next to nothing, they should have gotten rid of those artificial sweeteners by now
At the WH, women are paid less RT @NancyPelosi: #1010Means mill of Ams would see higher wageparticularly women work full time #RaiseTheWage
@NancyPelosi @Sanddragger Millions of teens will lose their ENTRY level jobs with government interference in wages.
@NancyPelosi @HouseDemocrats YOU ARE OFFENDING WOMEN EVERYWHERE we are not a weakling who needs the govt to hold our hands GO AWAY
@adampboyd @NancyPelosi @HouseDemocrats LOL whats the matter the truth hurts typical lib when they dont like the facts they attack grow up
@NancyPelosi When the prices of all goods are raised to meet the new wage what will you do to rescue these loafers again?
@NancyPelosi hey, how about u and rest of politicians take a pay cut and help fix the economy instead of killing job growth. #disgustingHAG
@NancyPelosi @Sanddragger You are a danger to the very fabric of this Country with your Economic illeteracy.
@NancyPelosi starter jobs are not careers.  ppl need to expand skill sets and promote. onsite daycare srvcs will help..
@NancyPelosi if ur 35 & still mak'n #minimumwage thats on u, not the peoplee u work 4 #RaiseTheWage #obamacaresucks #Congress made u wealthy
@NancyPelosi a jobs plan would be better...#1010Means  more layoffs and a worse economy
@NancyPelosi More money means less jobs or they increase the sale prices by like 100000% you don't have this youth vote .
@NancyPelosi @goconstance so it sounds like the women on here don't more $!!!!! glad  Im not a woman!!!!!!
@NancyPelosi   I have one for you, it is called cutbacks cause companies can't afford it Idiot
@NancyPelosi - mock Benghazi but feel for the soldiers u put as risk for political gains u scumbag
@NancyPelosi ...keep people employed.  better loan repayment and easier access to higher ed will help, not handing out$
@NancyPelosi and yet in the long term no one is helped outside of middle class kids who work at McDonald’s, cause this will raise the col.
@NancyPelosi people think it will help teens but actually it will cost all teens their jobs making their parent cover for that extra money
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse How about job creation instead of higher pay for flipping burgers? More jobs would do better than higher minimum.
$10 to start and move it up to $15 w/in 3 years. @NancyPelosi
.@NancyPelosi Go home. You're drunk.
@NancyPelosi Nacy needs to learn you get paid for the job you work. Not the life you live.
@NancyPelosi Nancy, how much do we the people pay you for your pension? You don't know? That would be over 200,000 dollars per year for ever
@NancyPelosi and how much do you pay your interns, Nancy?
@NancyPelosi these companies go public to help ppl make money you guys wanting to put salary caps is ludicris.
@NancyPelosi MS SPEAKER, I am from the bay area silicon valley to be precise. these companies started in garages, kitchens one being Intel
@NancyPelosi The real reality is people would watch their jobs get cut while consumers watch prices sky rocket.
@NancyPelosi Yes, if the 1 percent put their money back into circulation the economy would rebound.
@NancyPelosi that would be great for employees of companies that horde their profits, since we cant afford to pay rent on minimum wage.
So the women in the White house will suddenly get the same pay as men if #1010Means s passed? @NancyPelosi #LibHypocrisy #Economics101 #ccot
$10.10 is the very least we should do to #RaisetheWage for hardworking Americans & their families:  @NancyPelosi
@STrimel @UniteWomenPA @NancyPelosi I believe all politicians know this. They simply repeat the teenager fable in hopes voters will fall 4it
@somalirosek @UniteWomenPA @NancyPelosi: exactly right. Reality is people try to support families on poverty wages.
@STrimel I'm really sick of the trope of low wage workers being something other than hard working pillars of our nation. @UniteWomenPA
If they like their job, they can keep their job? Not gonna happen. Payroll budget stays the same in the real world .@NancyPelosi
Because @NancyPelosi doesn't know #Economics101 ... http://www.moneynews.com/NealAsbury/minimum-wage-increase-unemployment-middle-class/2013/03/14/id/494620/ … Proof #1010Means FEWER JOBS 4 the middle Class #JobKillers #ccot

@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse   Very good illustration shedding light on who really is earning minimum wage:  MAJORITY WORKING MOTHERS .
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse it's time for change
@NancyPelosi as a politician, why RU content in maintaining the current situation by keeping them @ minimum wage? What RU afraid of?
@NancyPelosi As a politician, what are you doing to create the environment so people can STRIVE to make MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE???
@NancyPelosi #RaiseTheWage it's already dead in the water, Nancy. Give it up.
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse RazeTheWage,. People without skills or access to min. wage jobs are put out of work. Working is a RIGHT!
@NancyPelosi @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats Economy slows drastically - grows only 0.1%.  Obama Dems policies are an utter failure. #1010Means
Hey @NancyPelosi how about championing more people dropping out of school, So Govt can take care of EVERYONE? #tcot
#tcot #UniteBlue, Can we really trust @NancyPelosi 4 ANYTHING Coming out of her MOUTH? #RaiseTheWage is a #SCAM.
@NancyPelosi thank you for the information people just refused to love anymore  that's the whole problem
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse Most of the preceding comments are from people who hate the poor and middle class,  would not be averse to slavery
@NancyPelosi In macroecon and whether you are liberal or conservative Says law still applies
supply creates its own demand
don't kill supply
@NancyPelosi   It would be nice to even have a job. Thank you very much!
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse hi
@NancyPelosi @ChrisVanHollen 0.1% growth ?   No wonder your going to lose.
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse You raise the wages, then the price of every day food goes up to 8 to 10$ a gallon. Then what?
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse i'm offended by the teen's acne and assumptious gaming controller.
“@NancyPelosi: #1010Means millions of Americans would see higher wages—particularly women who work full time. #RaiseTheWage" #SingleMothers
@NancyPelosi   What planet do you live on? You make up a bunch of numbers & think it must be true! You are just getting away from obamacare!
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse let me say it again! Increased wages= increased cost of living. No one gets ahead! Decrease the cost if living!
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse Please pass the Unemployment benefits bill and wait on the minimum wage bill it's important this gets passed .
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse You'd think the focus would be getting the demographic to change so that high paying jobs would be available.
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse THAT is a complete lie.  Please apologize or perhaps you didn't read what you put out, you know like how you vote.
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse so college would be considered 'extra spending money' because it's not as expensive as it is, right?
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse higher prices too #dumbass
@NancyPelosi. love you Nancy!
@NancyPelosi you're clueless.
Raising the wage will HURT bussiness. Less hours and more struggles! Get ready to pay for a 10 dollar big mac!
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse : STOP TAXING us to the poor house!   Help families by stopping illegal immigration.
@NancyPelosi I understand the problem I also understand that everyone elseW/HSor higher deserves&needs similar raises&inflation will result
@NancyPelosi THIS $10.10 only increases cost 2 bus.  Ds only know how to make bus pay more for everything WHILE COSTING PEOPLE THEIR JOBS
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse will you stop with the woman thing and raising wages will cut work force and put small businesses out of business
@NancyPelosi @HouseDemocrats Raising the FEDERAL minimum wage will help only a small MINORITY, help EVERYONE and bring fuel prices down!
@NancyPelosi here again Ds INCREASE COSTS 2 bus W/OUT making a sellable product to pay for it LET BUS CREAT JOBS THAT EMPLOY MORE PEOPLE
@NancyPelosi When I was working for MW back in high school, like the kid on the left, I recall it being good $ :
@NancyPelosi how about the millions not getting, or losing their jobs because of it?
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse 4get damn pay hike....WHERE ARE THE JOBS 4 THOSE WHO HAVE NONE!!!!! @BarackObama @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems
@NancyPelosi #liar #obama #minimumwage #ImpeachObama
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse ...and yet, regardless, it is going to raise the cost of living for everyone/will be worse for the whole.
@NancyPelosi @HouseDemocrats How about concentrating Jobs, instead of pushing something that will destroy them? Your working BACKWARDS!
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse making the dollar so inflated it's obsolete will not solve the problem, just create more for small business owners
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse In her ridiculous Utopian world.
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse I'd call you ma'am but, you've not earned respect. From America- you can go fuck yourself, along with the rest.
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse how's that communist education, or lack thereof working? Americans, aren't bought. Sold yourself short
@NancyPelosi If you want to get ahead, learn a trade, go to school, invest in your own future. Simply raising the wage is a band-aide.
@NancyPelosi fine raise the wages. But make sure everything else doesn't go up in price. Groceries. Gas. Key essentials.
@NancyPelosi So sad your fighting for fast food job careers,instead of High paying jobs.Oh yah you ruined that too.Living in bubble always.
@NancyPelosi I agree! Citizens need real wage increase, pas HR:25 Fair Tax Bill & Citizens keep all THEIR earnings!
EEUU 
@NancyPelosi: #1010Means millions of Americans would see higher wages—particularly women who work full time. ”
@NancyPelosi WRONG ole nancy. many would become unemployed due to new min wage. check it our via true economists not ADM FOLKS.
@NancyPelosi What does the goat say?
@NancyPelosi You have ruined kids part time jobs.Fast food Jobs were always a beginning job,not a career.This is what you created.YOUR PARTY
@NancyPelosi bring back jobs from overseas and leave the #fastfood jobs to teens and convicts. Tax imports our predecessors did @Bobbyzzzz
@Baker4lfe @NancyPelosi @Bobbyzzzz isn't that what @BarackObama is fighting 4? Just wondering.
@Baronium @NancyPelosi @Bobbyzzzz @BarackObama wel thanks to @SpeakerBoehner balls held by #tparty he can only sign what's in front of him
@NancyPelosi we would like you to make less money and stop outsourcing and stop spending our money. How does that sound.
@NancyPelosi #1010means #Inflation #unemployment
@NancyPelosi Say, do you have any unpaid interns?
@NancyPelosi Where is the money? Who will pay for it? You Or @BarackObama or @SenatorReid out of your own packets?
@NancyPelosi you refuse to answer: who pays for the increase?
Really? Don't act like you care. It's really embarrassing. @NancyPelosi
