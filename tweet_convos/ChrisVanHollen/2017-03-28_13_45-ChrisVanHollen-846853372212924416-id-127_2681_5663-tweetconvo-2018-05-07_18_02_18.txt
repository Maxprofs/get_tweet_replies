Devin Nunes just said he will never reveal his intel source to other members of the intel committee: "Nope, never."

h/t @SZilberstein
Who is "we"?
his sources. they're standing right next to him. can't you see them too? :P
Harvey, is that you?
We should tweet our support of him on this issue to combat the sure fire shit storm that he's going to face from Trump nuts
@StlGal_36 One Republican trying to hold onto his job! #Election2018
Sometimes I wonder if @RepWalterJones is really a Republican.
You mean coz maybe he's a half decent person? Not many of them in GOP for sure.
I don't agree w all his views but he stood against Iraq War & met w Gold Star fams in DC office.
@DeborahSine nunes = criminal
@JoshuaBrown95 Walter Jones.  . Could u not find a less influential member?
@Mon9lem does he have any GOP congress friends???
@_tonyaspencer http://youtu.be/x4yRdsDFRps 
 why are you still talking about Hillary? Move on, Cathy.
@JessicaHuseman @DevinNunes has zero credibility as impartial investigator & Rep. Props @RepWalterJones. More @GOP must follow.
Nunes should step aside. His days in the House are numbered
@RepWalterJones Thank you for putting your Country above your party. You Sir are a true Patriot.   #FireNunes
@freespeechtv They need an ind intel cmte.Idc if he recuses.Hasnt he behaved badly enough to have his decision disregarded?
You are a Patriot Walter Jones! Now if your colleagues could stand for People the way you did!
nunes should resign
Nah, nothing crooked abt that. Nothing to see here folks. 
Where are the rest of them?
@BovarysComplnt thank god somebody wit balls
@RepWalterJones thank you for being the only Patriot of the GOP. You are the future of party. The others are dead men walking.
hear that @SpeakerRyan ???
@Dalton642 thank you @RepWalterJones! reassuring to for someone in ur party to speak up against blatant wrongdoing. NEXT?? @GOP
Wow, 1 less #Comrade #CongrASShole redeeming his American citizenship??? #WeWillSee @RepWalterJones @BraddJaffy @sandraclunie
He also supports HR 356 calling for an independent commission & it only needs one more Republican! @RepWalterJones @ericswalwell
reading through @RepWalterJones ' stand on AHCA & bills he wrote, looks like he's one of the GOPs to put country over party.
@ChrisVanHollen  Nunes shouldn't have to bow out for doing his job.
perhaps because the isn't one to reveal?
@conniewhitehome good...country over party
.@BraddJaffy .@WillMcAvoyACN .@RepWalterJones Thank you for showing courage in the defense of our nation!
I hope there are more.
@antibigotry123 Hurray for this decent human! Walter Jones
@RepWalterJones Thank you! Good man ! The right call !
thank you! The right call ! Good man !
thank you @RepWalterJones for putting country before party. You're a true American Patriot.
@crankybecky He doesn't need to recuse himself.  He did what he did to keep it from getting covered up
@jonathanvswan 

Walter Jones is now is prime to be primaried in 2018.

I'll donate to his primary challenger. Who will step up?
slowly GOP will realize they can't support this corrupt party.. they need to fix this mess.  and they all know .
Thats a good step.  The GOP should dump Trump rather than side with a coverup of Russia scandal. Voters will remember.
@AJentleson @RepWalterJones is a great patriot.  America over party
@MaggieJordanACN omg finally a republican that puts country first. Cheers to you sir.
@nhdogmom r there any other patriots in the GOP
A few, not many.
See Magic @RepMikeBishop it's actually possible to do the right thing.
@RepWalterJones That's what a patriotic public servant does. Thank you
thank you @RepWalterJones for holding @DevinNunes accountable and holding ethics and principle above partisanship.
thank you @RepWalterJones 
#theresistance
#Trumprussia 
#NunesMustRecuse
Does he count as GOP if he started his political life as a Democrat? If you raise them in the way they should go...
Jones senile hell b voted out NUNES GREAT AMERICAN HERO
@emzorbit Out of 435 members in the House, millions of Americans now recognize & appreciate Rep. Walter Jones of North Carolina.
@TerryCanales40 FINALLY! At least 1 of them is starting to think with their head!
@ealight461 about time but too little too late seems like Jones only did this because of 2018 election to save his seat
@LindseyGrahamSC what say you Senator Graham????  Step up to the plate, your voice is needed
thank you @RepWalterJones for working toward getting to the truth! Now if the other @GOP members would do the same!
Nunes has no sources, just a big lie to justify cancelling hearing and allowing Sally Yates to testify the real truth.
I have instructed my staff @TeamIssa to let me know the most politically opportune moment to call for Nunes to recuse himself
thank you @RepWalterJones for your patriotism
@ChrisVanHollen There's one! Sickening cowards how they're fine with this total betrayal of their oath to country & American ppl
So proud of you Jones. 
@hanseldee Thank you for your patriotism 
@RepWalterJones Thank you for calling for Nunes to recuse himself. You have done the patriotic thing. We are grateful.
he is one if the few GOP's with compassion and sense.  Seems like a good guy.
@ChrisVanHollen THE PEOPLE ARE ASKING TO RECLUSE YOURSELF!
If he doesn't than he's reputation will be destroyed. Pick one?
@MoElleithee Wow, so there is such a thing as a GOPer who puts his country over party!
We don't give a shit what a #NeverTrump-er thinks.
Did you hear?  He is John McCain's protege.
@secohig Thank you @RepWalterJones @HouseGOP @GOP Appreciate your patriotism!
Thank you @RepWalterJones !
Thank you @RepWalterJones for putting country before party. Hopefully your integrity is contagious for the rest of the @GOP
4...3...2...1....
just takes he first one
when he says our and we he certainly isn't talking about the rest of Intel comm. it will come out it always does
THANK YOU! Country over party.
Then they cannot expect that any "leaks" or whistleblowers identities should be revealed to them, tit for tat I say.
Wait.... are there still Republicans who care about the safety & security of America from foreign attacks & interference?! SWEET
Not good enough.  Time to call independent counsel to investigate.  Entire process tainted by Nunes and GOP.
Bout fucking time we start getting some brave takers here.
another gop wuss
@GlennKesslerWP oh noooo a republican with a conscience
@GlennKesslerWP @RepWalterJones Nunes has done nothing wrong! Why should he? #lynchingagainamongGOP
I imagine the "WIDELY DECIMINATED" evidence Nunes has might be quit frightning for some
Walters is probably on Soros payroll! I want Schiff to recuse himself he's leaked just as much info as Nunes has!
@RepWalterJones Thank you!
@DemFromCT Thank you, @RepWalterJones!!!
First and only Repub. so far with some integrity....and maybe some balls.
@ealight461 NUNESMUSTGO
ONE voice of reason! @GOP @SpeakerRyan have u no shame! What a disgrace when your families read abt this part of history!
The first domino!
@crampell Yay for little Walter! @virginiafoxx
thank you Mr. Jones!
Walter Jones, even though from my home state-NC, is &always has been in idiot.
@crampell Yes!
VERY RARE , REPUBLICAN WITH BALLS
Good. We need more of you, @GOP ER's, to join in. We need u 2  stop obstructing and 2 start doing the job we're paying you for.
@thegarance oh well you can't always get what you want 
Good for @RepWalterJones
it shouldn't be an option! If he doesn't recuse willingly, he should be forced and GOP must support.
only takes a small crack for others to quack.
If WH trying to use Nunes to prevent Sally Yates from testifying, why doesn't she just go to the media with her info?
@Wacipi That is good to see. It's also smart thinking. Who wants to go down with this sinking ship?
this just in. Nobody cares
hahaha NEVER going to happen!!
@SenJohnMcCain You're a patriot. Step up and demand accountability from Nunes
your a traitor get out of our country
Thank you @RepWalterJones for being an ethical, courageous lawmaker in our country. Now talk to your colleagues. Please.
thank goodness!
Thank you, @RepWalterJones! A true patriot.
@cjbennett777
i saw
Bravo!  The first of many, I hope.  Time to clean house and by that I mean The White House!
MUTINY on The #Trump BOUNTY @JoeNBC! {@BraddJaffy: @GOP Rep Walter Jones Becomes 1st House Republican To Publicly Call For #Nunes To Recuse
Finally someone with some sense, ethics and guts!
Let's get this moving
That's great. Looks like there is at least one true Patriot within the @GOP house. Thx for putting ur Country above ur party!
One Ringy-Dingy?

this should be the focus until he steps down
standing ovation!
Thank you @RepWalterJones for putting country over party!
Thank u Rep. Jones for doing the right thing!
