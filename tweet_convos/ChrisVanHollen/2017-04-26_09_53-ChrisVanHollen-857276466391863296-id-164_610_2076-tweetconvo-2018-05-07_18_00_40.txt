Our country is strongest when workers and families are at their strongest. That's why we must #RaiseTheWage 
2024 is way too far in the future. Where I live, lots of homeless working people living in RVs, in tents, slum conditions.
Really? So if you hire me to mow your lawn and I spend 40 hrs a week meticulously hand-trimming it, how much do you owe me exactly?
$1 million
Fine. But when prices rise?

Perfect example why Socialists who're looking at property law leave dems in the dust.

Yeah. Point #2 isn't true. I've seen democratic pundits say "Of course Mylan raised prices on Epipens when demand went up"
Congrats on writing a great house tweet! http://greathousetweets.measuredvoice.com/ChrisVanHollen/status/857276466391863296 â€¦ (Ranked 9th for Apr 26.)
#RaisetheWage $15 now! not 2024!
2024? The year 2024? Obsolete
It can't be federally mandated. Some states are able to buy so much more with less $ than others. & minimum wage should mean minimum living.
Define 'minimum living wage'.  For who? Single? Family? Franks and beans? Steak? It's an arbitrary # at best. A complete scam at worst

2024? WTF? The middle class will be gone by then.
Agree with the starting premise. Honor the worker. But how 'bout approaching with ways to reduce major costs of housing and medical?
Stop stealing my money.
Then you better be prepared for severe unempployment. Small biz cannot handle that number. proven time and time again.
...raise the wage...raise unemployment
If you work full time at a job that is a low paying,unskilled labor you should be training in ur off time for a better paying job.
They only occupy a fed seat....thinking is optional...
what also continues poverty? Incredible defense spending, corporate welfare and for profit healthcare....getting rid of those would help too
That's rich (no pun intended) coming from a career politician. In what world do you live in with inflation rises etc is that near enough??
You shouldn't have to live in anything besides luxury.  Join me in an effort to raise the minimum wage to $500/hour!
Mmm, I can't wait to make an omelet with some of those $380 eggs.
SEVEN YEAR PHASE IN? what a joke...you should be ashamed to call yourself a democrat!
No kidding! In 1969, I worked for minimum wage, about $1.70/hr. Buying power of $11.40/hr. No CEOs died of starvation.
Millions of jobs will be automated soon *no matter what the minimum wage is*.
You can't set a realistic min wage on a federal level. $15 is not the same in CA as it is in TX. Should be state regulated.
And the price of a Happy meal to 7.50!
@SenSanders @SenateDems @PattyMurray I sure would like to see congress work Full Time or cut pay to half time! MAGA!
No...by 2018,please! Or how about NOW?! Executive order please?!
It should be $15 for US Citizens and Legal Immigrants, not for Illegals.
Then get it voted in ! Not a unfare tax cut. Doesn't work ask President Bush
#raisethewage 
Sorry, @ChrisVanHollen but that's nothing to be proud of.
@PattyMurray 2024 is not soon enough. Do better.
Congress should also pass spending bills for single payer, jobs program, higher ed, etc Bc US is monetary sovereign & #TaxesDontFundSpending
Except y'all need to do it RIGHT NOW. No more bullshit
2024????
Raising the minimum wage is counterproductive. It will increase unemployment. #Econ101
2024?
Get it tied to inflation like it should be instead of something Congress has to vote on when people are screaming "uncle".
Sad when babysitters make $12-20/hr but school aides make $8.
I'd love to see you elected officials make on my salary and then ask how you feel about help 7 years from now. Too little too late!
By 2024 it won't be enough. We need $15 now
The sentiment is good, but 2024 is far away & $15 an hour will not be much then. We can do better! #raisethewage NOW!
Written by a true academic.
Who clearly didn't pass principles of economics.
There are a lot of jobs where people don't expect to make a living from them. They provide extra money to a lot of people.
This will kill jobs and accelerate automation. You know this and are misleading your constituents.
Anyone who has any knowledge in the economy knows raising the minimum wage doesn't help. It kills jobs and causes increase in prices...
Thrown right back on the consumer.
By 2024? Get real!!! Did you hit your head on a large rock? Time for you to go. You've lost your usefulness!
The issue is that by the time it's 2024 all the costs for living will go up and that $15 will feel the same as ten.
You know this will cause millions of jobs to disappear from the economy, yet you push it anyway. This is so disingenuous @ChrisVanHollen
How long did it take to figure that out?   You can barely make it on even 15. After your taxes you can't!!!
I hope y'all enjoy unemployment because if you raise it companies will just cry work forces to cover the difference
On the wrong side AGAIN
Fucktards. Those living in poverty (where u keep them, your voter base) dont pay taxes. $15 is a nice ploy to garner more tax revs.
2024 is way too late. $15 by 2020 at the latest.
That would make SUCH a difference!!!!
When my Burger gets made properly I will support 15$ a hour
...is $15.18. This is an issue that needs a serious solution NOW, not seven years from now. This is what we elected you for.
Adjusted for inflation, the federal minimum wage should be over $20. It's been stagnant for years. A living wage for one adult in my county
With all due respect, Senator, we cannot wait seven years. I work for minimum wage, and I and others have needs right now.
It's not that the work isn't hard, it's that anyone can do it. It's called "entry level." Want manager pay, become the manager.
Single stupidest economic proposal of all time. Even worse than free college and SS.
Senator...you are overpaid.  As such, your paycheck should be cut by 75%.
You are a fool, $15 per hour is closing down small businesses and replacing employees all over the country and you have no idea?
I would think this was a joke if it weren't so horrifically unfunny. Proud? Of what? You should all be ashamed of yourselves all the time.
2024? Woah...woah...slow down there, skippy...
It should be $15 now!! I'll be on the streets before 2024
tell that to republicans and corporate dems who don't want tor raise it at all.
They would leave it as is is and still say it's too high.
Is everyone stupid!?  $15 min wage means cost of EVERYTHING goes up and now middle class is no middle-lower class...
@Cheetohjesus4 & with the high cost of living that's still poorU can live better selling #Reefer #TrumpRussia #resist
2024?? We are thrilled at Dem support to raise MW to $15, but SHOCKED that you think living in poverty for 8 MORE YEARS is FINE? 

NO WAY.
By 2024? This is something you are proud of?
That's still poverty
If you have no skills at a job any moron can do, and you can barely do it well yourself, you are not deservant of an increase of wages.
That's the problem. People can't find full time work with the current system of regulations...
Raising minimum wage will reduce hiring, bring in new tech to replace useless people, and prevent people of low skill to be hired.
If you work full time in a job designed for teenagers, you obviously did something wrong with your life.
and then the prices go up and us on fixed incomes are in poverty. Intro Econ, come on you are smarter than that
Ill be out on the streets by 2024
@SenSanders @SenateDems by 2024 the cost of living will surpass the $15. Back to square one. Raise the bar a little higher
By 2024 there will no longer be a need for $15. The way things are going $15 willl not be enoigh
Universal health care for all, including congress, senate, and Mr. Trump
We need atleast a $15.00 minimum wage. Ball players make millions to play stupid games.@ChrisVanHollen @SenateDems
bs... while pur Former POTUS44 who I voted for sold and still selling us workers ... just $400,000 for the "fat cats" as he called them.
Just doesn't matter
You think $15hr lifts people from poverty? Ed reform, tech training, accountability, charter schools, mandatory parental involvement, more
They think we don't understand economics! Quit acting like we the people are stupid!
Raise minimum wage -> rise in costs -> raise min wage -> rise in cost... join the #RaiseTheWage perpetual vote buying inflation machine!
2024 is too far away! Inflation will kill it by that time! Re-think this! I am willing to pay 15 an hour now!
Job destroyer. Everywhere $15 min happened.
The wage depends on the job
If minimum wage was set at $481/hr then every full time employee would earn $1,000,000 a year.
2024? Are you kidding me? Why wait so long? You KNOW people can't live on min wage. Ins, Banks & politicians make criminal amounts of $ NOW!
Shouldnt you be speaking out against Bamster's recent 400K speaking fee? Or maybe the 60m book deal? Lol power to live ur life As hypocrite
2024 what a joke! America is under attack from within and you jokers are still trying to play politics!!Get off your asses and do something!
Did any media cover this besides FSTV? I heard nothing on NPR.
3 questions: what should be pay of those who've learned skill & got raise? What incentives to learn skill? Why not $481/hr?
Way to keep up with the times. $15 minimum wage in 2024 will be like the $7.25 that it is now.
It should be $20 now, Will we be still using  then #wakeup
The "democratic" president we just had said $9/hr would be just fine in a state of the union address
@SenSanders @SenateDems @PattyMurray IM UPSET SUFFER BECAUSE YOU GO TO DRIVE THRU & OR GROCERY STORE.THEY DONTDESERVE IT
A lot of those people won't be working at all if you raise the min.
says whom?
I wonder why so many very rich people are so adamantly against this.  Hmm, I wonder...
That's a simple way to misunderstand labor. Simple.
@SenSanders @SenateDems @PattyMurray NOT ON MIN WAGE SO QHAT HAPPENS TO THEM .OUR GOID WILL GO UP ETC
SENIORS WILL SUGFER.
2024? That's some bullshit
2024? Are you kidding me?
By 2024 is too late, people need a wage they are able to live off of and not be working two or three jobs just to survive for that month.
That's a great jobs bill!  Tell Pelosi
Raising the minimum wage does nothing when rent just goes up to take up the difference. Sadly a raise just means more money for the rich.
@SenSanders @SenateDems @PattyMurray Aloy of people employees have attitudes dint trat people right.PLEASE TO MUCH.
@SenSanders @SenateDems @PattyMurray NO NOT 15.00 what about people making 15.00-20.00 an hr now???  It should be deserved
What about those making $1million+ a year? You're focusing on the wrong end of the spectrum. The working poor aren't the enemy.
$15 isn't a livable wage now and it won't be in 2024! Not as long as other expenses remain high. #Health #housing #Education
See what I mean? http://bit.ly/2p4RCTJ  #RockefellersDog
On the flip side of this, of everything was expensive as hell that would help too. Isn't there a way to control inflation or costs?
Exactly. There have to be other reforms around housing, inflation, etc. can't JUST throw money at the problem. 
Neither Party is on the peoples side!! This is outrageous! Prices RISE. They never fall! Wages stagnated.
No one should be living in poverty. NO ONE. Poverty is cruel and unusual punishment in a post scarcity, consumerism driven environment.
But as long as the bankster land lords
Keep bidding up the prices of homes
And razing rents for the workers
We will be poor even with 15$\hr
By 2024, $15.00 won't be high enough.Lets be be realistic.
By that time what will prices have risen to?? Prices keep going UP, ppl will not be able to afford anything!! People really need $20/hr NOW.
No, they need $100/hr, YESTERDAY!
I am speaking for rural MO!! Good Lord SF Bay Area should get waaay more!! Or NYC or etc
Mr. VanHollen not to be disrespectful sir but have you looked at what's going on in Venezuela with socialism that Bernie Sanders preaches
If you earn minimum wage you shouldn't be having kids.

Duh
It should have been $15 a decade ago. By 2024 it should be a lot higher.
Why not $50/hr, or better yet, $100/hr?
Why only $15?  Why not $100/hour?  Lets ALL be rich.




#Psychopaths don't care About anyone
But themselves and their friends.

They will kill #MercilessIndianSavages
And celebrate 500 genocides.
2024? WTF?!? I'll starve to death before next winter.
Geez. You must live outside.


Poor little snowflake you haven't seen anything yet our president Donald Trump will have a minimum three nominees on the Supreme Court ha ha 

Schumer sleeps at night while the rest of Americans try to figure out how to pay the rent food basic needs we go hungry while they grow fat 
Why so long. 2024????

Everything is free free healthcare with a $10,000 deductible tell the truth for once $1800 a month with a $10,000 deductible thanks a lot 
By then it should be $17 an hour.  People need relief now
Chris VanHollen associates with a known pervert Bernie Sanders funny how no one ever mentions it was a pornographic writer sleazebag truth
@SenSanders @SenateDems $15/hour isn't going to do it. But it's a good start.
If it's now because by 2024, $15.00 will be too little, too late.

keep pushing that $15 an hour and by the way the gravy train is over go try and get a job with your piercings and tattoos ha ha
