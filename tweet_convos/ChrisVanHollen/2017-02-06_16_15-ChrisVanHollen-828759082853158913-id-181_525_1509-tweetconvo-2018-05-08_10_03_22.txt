as a constituent, THANK YOU, again for standing up for our school children--please don't stop & don't give up!
Thank you for standing for quality higher ed & protection against scam universities #holdthefloor #gainfulemploymentrule
So glad DeVos was confirmed. We need someone like her to challenge education system status quo.
And "expert" Dems have done such a great job with public schools in places like Baltimore,Camden, Detroit, etc
Dem experts also ran StL, Philly, Cleve, Newark, Cincy, etc pub. schools into ground.See a pattern?
Of course not
not this Marylander. You don't speak for me
41,000 out of 6,000,000 Marylanders.... not quite sure you're making the point you think you are
thank u for taking a stand. Against Devos. Keep it up
Thank you Senator Van Hollen.  Her lack of knowledge and commitment to IDEA is particularly scary says this Bethesda mom.
@FogBelter meh I don't trust him
nice to have a record though for future reference. Trust but verify 
Traitor to the American public and Maryland. If you stand 4 those few. Where do U stand for the rest of US -The 5.96 mil.
thank you
sad day for America
A case of the blind  leading the blind. Ignorant  refused  to be informed but would protest  anything even  for their good
how many are union teachers trying to save their jobs. Education in Allegany county MD is terrible.
Thank you, Chris. You're doing us proud.
thank you for standing up. Keep going!
Thank you Chris

You mean you sold out to the 14,000 plus union teachers. You're just another swamp dwelling sellout.
Schools are supposed to teach kids how to think for themselves not what you think! I support @BetsyDeVos

Thank you for standing against a clearly unqualified nominee.  #DumpDevos
Great! Many children are receiving a sub-par education & you are supporting the system that does not help them  to succeed.
Consumer choice inspires innovation and product improvement. Why is monopoly in education better? Chilren first. @POTUS

Before DeVos final vote, help more folks call GOP Senators vulnerable 2018 by RT tweet shown here: https://twitter.com/latestoutrage/status/827657184779591681 … 
Ask GOP Senators Heller (R-NV) & Flake (R-AZ) To Reject Unqualified Betsy DeVos Or Be Voted Out In 2018 http://www.gq.com/story/gop-senators-betsy-devos-vote … #StopDeVos 
As a Maryland Voter; Thank You!
thank you!
Republican & Democrat citizens are united against DeVos. Let's hope Republican Senators get on board and Vote NO on DeVos!
Please make sure our other @SenatorCardin votes against her, too. He's been making mistakes. No more votes for ANY nominee!!
The hypocrisy of trying to block a SecEd who's entire agenda is to help the underprivileged get a higher education.
Thank you
Thank you!
thank you! Please keep fighting!!

Pls help me help our @POTUS out! RT this enough times for him to see it.

Maybe he'll understand it better in song form.
