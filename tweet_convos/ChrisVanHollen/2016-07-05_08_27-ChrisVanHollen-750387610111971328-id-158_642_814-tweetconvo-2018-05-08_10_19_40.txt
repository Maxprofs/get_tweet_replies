...nothing will stop a criminal from obtaining a weapon.  stop trying to disarm law abiding citizens. ..
Would you have sold a gun to Omar Mateen? After a background check? I am genuinely curious.
...depends on what the background check showed...
Presumably it would have shown that The FBI investigated him for possible ties to Jihadists.
...that is only your opinion. ..
Omar Mateen had been investigated by the FBI. True or false?  Opinion doesn't factor in.
...the question is not that he was investigated but if the FBI  flagged him...
...the presumption on your part was your opinion...
@RepMaloney @SpeakerRyan @NRA ISIS smuggled guns into Brussels & Paris. In Orlando, they bought them locally. Thanks #NRA!
He was taken off the list when cleared by the FBI, dipshit.
But since we are talking now, I believe two FBI tips that a person may be a jihadist should prevent the purchase of...
Too silly to warrants a response. I don't think any civilian should own that kind of gun. But tell yourself whatever you want.
@WhipHoyer @SpeakerRyan @NRA because you didn't write it you automatically don't like it? WTF why don't you get something done.
She is TRYING 2 get something done but this obsession w/assault guns is nonsense.
she is only interested in getting what she wants not what's good for America #compromise
So by your perception, what exactly is GOOD for America
innocent until proven guilty, reasonable search and seizure, probable cause - 4 a start
This is not about basic civil rights. This is about access to weapons that kill in < 5secs
really you should think about that for a minute and go read the proposed bill.
@RepCummings @SpeakerRyan @NRA
Because who needs due-process right? It's innocent until proven guilty not the other way around.
@RepDavidEPrice @SpeakerRyan @NRA Lady you need to resign. You should know what's in a Bill before voting, not(ACA) afterwards
@RepDianaDeGette @SpeakerRyan @NRA Nancy, please read the 6th amendment.  Learn due process.
the NRA is people of all political parties! You Pelosi do not rule the people of the country just your state
Mr. Speaker STOP giving power 2 Gun Lobbyists! GIVE power 2 beautiful young voices silenced by GUN VIOLENCE!

thank you @NancyPelosi. Also, don't let them hide behind the 2nd amendment on the #NoFlyNoBuy.
You have no concept of common sense gun laws. Punish the criminals not the legal gun owners with more laws.
@RepCummings Hate - like the poor - will ALWAYS be with us. Work around that if you can. God Almighty, be sensible!!!
We want to #DisarmHate here & the hate we participate in Palestine. Quit arming APARTHEID Israel!
madam pelosi and common sense!!! Almost threw up!
@RepCummings @SpeakerRyan @NRA UR PEOPLE ARENT GETTING THE GUNS, DON'T EVEN TRY! OBAMA WILL GET WHAT HE WANTS
Aren't #ManyPeople on the #SuspectedTerrorList #CompletelyInnocent? #GunControl is fine, but not #SecurityStateControl
@NancyPelosi @SpeakerRyan @NRA
Corey's e-mail server judgement: How it will affect Hillary's chances @
And GUN CONTROL keeps arms out of the hands of TERRORISTS only to addle-brained LIBERALS.
@RepBonnie @SpeakerRyan @NRA How much money are they paying you and are you getting to take away 2nd amendment?
funny how speaker has time to badger FBI Coney, but no time to address mass shooting and assault rifles
do you have proof the @NRA wrote the bill? I didn't think so. Just more lies from @SenateDems & @HouseDemocrats!!!
Democrats are STILL trying to TAKE AWAY America's guns, our rights + freedoms! BUT,  #2AShallNotBeInfringed
Nancy, nothing from you is ever common sense. You spout lies and hate.
@RepDianaDeGette @SpeakerRyan @NRA Well, hell, even Obama's FBI doesn't prevent suspected terrorists from buying weapons.
shut your ultra liberal, baby killing anti American pie hole. You are a traitor and are ruining this country
the inanimate object isn't the problem, it's certain people @SpeakerRyan @NRA
@ACLU @HinaShamsi Democratic no fly/no buy bills wiped Donk bottom with Bill of Rights. Can NRA do better?
I Agree with Nancy Pelosi!
Words on paper mean nothing w/o reverence & felty toward "the law". We now have leaders law & everyone else
@WhipHoyer u don't speak 4 all of America! Most Americans don't trust the government to protect #DueProcess  @SpeakerRyan @NRA
@deejay90192 @SpeakerRyan @NRA Exactly instead of him trying to use tax payer money for emails, what a digrace
really? when the amount of Natl back ground checks is breaking records?
we have the 4th amendment granting due process for a reason. This is an attack on due process.
@RepCummings @SpeakerRyan @NRA as a unionist I C contract as rights&wageAmerica hasn't had a raise N35years &U want R rights 2?

Stalker X breaks restraining order & stays away knowing I'm armed. where is my justice?
you are 100% #sleaze
You Nancy are the most incompetent person to ever hold an office. No more gun laws! We already have them.
.@NancyPelosi @Rep_JaniceHahn @SpeakerRyan @NRA In the United States, we are innocent until proven guilty.
.@NancyPelosi @RepCummings @SpeakerRyan @NRA no Americans don't want you compromising our rights.
@RepCummings @SpeakerRyan @NRA I'm in opposition to ALL GUN CONTROL this week -- including H.R. 5611.
Laws don't matter anymore. FBI ignores law for Hillary. Jim Comey just committed gross negligence.
@RepCummings @SpeakerRyan @NRA I don't trust a bill from Dems when they can't hold Hillary accountable. #WednesdayWisdom #tcot
The @NRA bill is an affront to the people of America. It makes a mockery of what Dem's sat in for. @NancyPelosi
Due process was not a NRA concept.  Read the constitution.
@annimallover hay Nancy good night which you support Hillary or Trump
The Rethug party name should be changed to the NRA party.
@HouseDemocrats @SpeakerRyan @NRA Oh Boo Hoo Pelosi! You have forgotten your place as a puppet on the People's strings!
@ChrisVanHollen @SpeakerRyan @NRA Thank you Rep. Pelosi & Rep VanHollen. Tired of the strangle hold the NRA has on Congress.
@RepZoeLofgren @SpeakerRyan @NRA The best way to stop Orlando from happening is to stop importing Muslims. Don't disarm America
@WhipHoyer @SpeakerRyan @NRA keep the good work.
@HouseDemocrats @SpeakerRyan @NRA now that is one hypocritical statement!!
atleast the nra has American citizens best interest not crooked politicians
.@NancyPelosi @PaladinCornelia @SpeakerRyan @NRA Think. Think. We are seeing too many children die from guns! #gunsafety
Seriously can you not understand that gun laws will not stop the lawless.
@HouseDemocrats @SpeakerRyan @NRA
@shannonrwatts @SpeakerRyan @NRA Good! I SAY NO VOTES ON ANY GUN LAWS! WORKS FOR ME.
once again, how about fixing the economy first rather than trying to take people's guns away? #iCorruption
@CandaceTX @SpeakerRyan @NRA Suspect terrorists protect by constitution right until can proven by the law.
you clown Nancy how are you still there??? Aren't you 105!!
I am America and you're wrong.
Gimme a break, the same old rhetoric, the Demolibs cause the problems and blame guns for it.
Crooked politicians like you are the problem, not the NRA.
#LYINGRYAN and try writing it without NRA , ALEC or other 'ghostwriters?'
that's the one thing Democrats especially from California do not have #commonsense Look how screwed up it is
so u say? speaker do zero  ryan. why? do u just not do your job instead of being a lot of bull shit and crap?
go live in Southside Chicago if you want strict gun laws. Let us know how it works out
@repsandylevin @SpeakerRyan @NRA common sense gun reform also needs to include due process protection via 5th amendment.
actually, Americans want you to stay the hell away from our guns altogether.
@HouseDemocrats @SpeakerRyan @NRA wrong.. We want you to stop the person who kills not the inanimate object. Pretty simple
common sense doesn't mean no guns.
@HouseDemocrats @SpeakerRyan @NRA Seems to me the ones we don't yet suspect are just as big a threat. With war weapons
So the NRA and their GOP supporters are for terrorists and support all their efforts to kill us!
From the Ding Bat who said " We have to pass the bill to see what's in it"
Tell the NRA BIOYA!
@RepCicilline @SpeakerRyan @NRA
@RepCicilline @SpeakerRyan @NRA Actually Americans want to be rid of all of you corrupt elitists.
Disarming law-abiding citizens isn't #commonsense. Go after criminals! #2A
Quit blabbing about gun violence prevention/control, DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  Show some real leadership for a change.
Try the white or milk chocolate once in a while Nancy. You're loosing it.
Really Nancy? Do you know any English speaking Americans?
@janschakowsky @SpeakerRyan @NRA Fix the no-fly list problems and you'd have more than a talking point.
Molon labe.
My kids are more important than a 3 day waiting period. Only 1 reason y someone has to have gun now.
hang in there Nancy!
And there are No Dem bills or bills written by others that does (cont) http://tl.gd/nmjrgn 
Tell him @NancyPelosi!
Lyin' Ryan has only written 2 bills, 1 was to name a building... he can't write a bill that would workn 20yrs
@HouseDemocrats @SpeakerRyan @NRA
@subutmohan7 @SpeakerRyan @NRA The NRA is heartless but worse still the GOP play stooges.
73% Americans agree more background checks needed. Not limits to types of guns.
just pass the NRA bill and figure it out after the fog. Idiot
@repbobbyscott @SpeakerRyan @NRA yes COMMON SENSE which ur proposal lacks
the answer to violence, including gun violence, is being more Compassionate, doing more Kindness :-)
so, in your opinion, exercising a constitutional right equates to HATE???
@RepDianaDeGette @SpeakerRyan @NRA
because obama did such a good job doing it in Chicago...
not the majority of ppl u liar you don't speak for me
How do you identify a suspected terrorist?
@BettyMcCollum04 @SpeakerRyan @NRA Indeed but I don't like to hear terrorists coming through the Mexican border unchecked.
@Nancy Pelosi is so incompetent she can only regulate inanimate objects she knows nothing about people
Yes they do @SpeakerRyan  we missed the mark.
@NancyPelosi @SpeakerRyan @NRA
@RepDavidEPrice @SpeakerRyan @NRA Yes, because when I think "common sense", Congress is what pops into my mind.
when I think common sense, Congress is the LAST thing to come to mind!
Pelosi just wants to be able to revoke 2A rights of political opponents. Not gonna work, honey.
There's nothing common sense about putting people on lists arbitrarily, leaving them no recourse to get off.
@HouseDemocrats @SpeakerRyan @NRA Do you people go to law school?  We don't create laws that bad people will follow?
You ignore the right of due process before you take away a person's rights.
and they are UNELECTED. Republicans swear oaths to unelected, serve them, instead of WE The People
@NancyPelosi @SpeakerRyan @NRA
Nancy bebe, #DEMOCRATS HAVE NO #COMMONSENSE ABOUT ANYTHING THEY DO!  @SpeakerRyan @NRA
Liberals want to control a list that they can put anyone and everyone on without "due process" = gun control
why don't you show some leadership and conduct the dem reps in a decorous manner?
True disarm @TheDemocrats & islamists... When are you going to @TheDemocrats gun free paradise of Chicago?
James Comey used to work for hedge funds & arms dealers. He's a Clinton crony?
