@ChrisVanHollen @mercerstine Thanks for being such a great Rep - you're one of the too-few voices of reason in the House.
@ChrisVanHollen How many signatures on #DischargePetition have you & @askgeorge been able to get today? We must end #BoehnerShutdown NOW TY!
@ChrisVanHollen I am a Realtor. This shutdown will cost me at least $2,025 in income this month alone because the USDA can't approve a loan!
He used similar tactic as state Sen. on gun bill. @ChrisVanHollen: Just filed discharge petition to force vote on clean CR to re-open govt.
@News8NewsTalk @chrisvanhollen tactic? Can't find a better word?
Hey, it's twitter. I was down to my last few characters. :-) @NooneOfan: @News8NewsTalk @chrisvanhollen tactic? Can't find a better word?
@News8NewsTalk @chrisvanhollen I understand, thank you for response 
Support @ChrisVanHollen #DearCongress @SpeakerBoehner WADR, I #DemandAVote on the Senate-passed CR to reopen Government.
Support @ChrisVanHollen #DearCongress @SpeakerBoehner House Democrats & WE the ppl #DemandAVote on Senate-passed CR 2 reopen our government!
.@ChrisVanHollen Thanks for trying to stop this #GOPshutdown.
.@sherrilee7 @ChrisVanHollen The mantra has to be #LetUsVote! Repeat it over and over.  Boehner won't let you vote! Undemocratic.
@ChrisVanHollen @Maggyw519 I admire the Democrats effort but GOP House Members will not go against Party. Party means more than Country; sad
@ChrisVanHollen Whether it succeeds or not, it is about individual accountability. Who is truly for the shutdown? Let's see who doesn't sign
@ChrisVanHollen @sherrilee7 your a good man!
@ChrisVanHollen @Alexand04557873 I wish Repubs had done the right thing & sided with Dems on that.Now,we may end up in default due to House
@ChrisVanHollen Good luck with that one!  Is your petition anything like the gimmicks the Demonrats exercised to pass ACA?
@ChrisVanHollen We support #demandavote!

@ChrisVanHollen Thank you! I have been contacting my GOP Rep. Luke Messer putting on the pressure. The #GOPshutdown is absurd, hurting U.S.
@ChrisVanHollen Yay!
@ChrisVanHollen @Paulx54 Thank God SOMEBODY cares about people!
@ChrisVanHollen Yes! Thank you! #DemandaVote #GOPshutdown #p2
@ChrisVanHollen Thank you!
@ChrisVanHollen @cheeriogrrrl Thank You Thank You Thank You and good luck!
@ChrisVanHollen nice going! Thanks so much.
@ChrisVanHollen @SusanSingerSCPM Thank you Chris Van Hollen. End the #BoehnerShutdown
@ChrisVanHollen @SusanSingerSCPM Who signs and where?!! #DemandaVote
Members of the House wld sign, which means 18 Repubs will have to join the Dems & say "enough!" @townlecat @ChrisVanHollen
@ChrisVanHollen  you are not representing the people of maryland. You are a obama puppet.
@ChrisVanHollen thank you, sir.  Somebody has to show leadership.  @SpeakerBoehner is content being a shill for this #TeaPartyShutdown
@ChrisVanHollen When @SpeakerBoehner is DEPOSED, @HouseDemocrats shd vote for a mod R who will not block bipartisan votes - like Peter King
The plot thickens. Rep @ChrisVanHollen files discharge petition to force House vote on clean CR. Needs moderate GOP lawmakers to join Dems
@PeterCCook @chrisvanhollen less talk, more action from the house moderates. Put them in check
@ChrisVanHollen Great I heard the FBI target range is closed and Boehner is trying to coax M. Lee & M. Bachman to stand-in for photo op
@ChrisVanHollen THANK YOU!  I've been wondering why it took so long to file a discharge petition!  Good luck!
@ChrisVanHollen We're praying it will happen.
@ChrisVanHollen  Well done! @auctnr1 this is how it's done. Sign the petition.
@ChrisVanHollen Thank you.
@ChrisVanHollen YES!!!
@ChrisVanHollen you should be able to get 218 sigs in one day --Go For IT
