@WhiteHouse how do you view the increased debt
@kcsunlover @WhiteHouse With rose colored glasses.
@WhiteHouse   Does it matter that the first seven years you never passed a budget?
@UPSManLIVE @WhiteHouse Only congress can pass a budget.
@MBrown6221 @WhiteHouse   True, but he still never had one of his budgets passed by Congress until Ryan   I'm sure you knew the difference
@UPSManLIVE @WhiteHouse That is why he kicked out Boehner. You do remember Congress name is "Do Nothing Congress".
@WhiteHouse What Progress?
@WhiteHouse Is it balanced?
