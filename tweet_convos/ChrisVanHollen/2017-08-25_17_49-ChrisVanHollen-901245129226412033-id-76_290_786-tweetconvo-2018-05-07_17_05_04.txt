Breaking News: President Trump pardoned Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff http://nyti.ms/2wwiwbP 
Please @ChrisVanHollen! How do we get rid of Trump before he does much worse. I'm somewhere between furious and sobbing.
Can you honestly tell me one thing Trump has done that had not been what his base asked him to do. We voted! Americans
I didn't vote for him and Arapio is a guilty criminal.
Please help us stop/get him out! He is destroying everything in the USA! He's a racist and doesn't care about most of us!!
If @SenateGOP @HouseGOP doesn't start to fight back, it will take many years to recover from this.
Congrats on writing a great house tweet! http://greathousetweets.measuredvoice.com/ChrisVanHollen/status/901245129226412033 â€¦ (Ranked 34th for Aug 25.)
Trump is trying to set a tone so his successor will hardon HIM. #DumpTrump
U r the racist.
And don't  have a problem with law breakers.

Did you weep when Obama had terrorists in the White House? Did you weep when O pardoned a traitor to our Country? You partisan hack.
So what are you going to do about it other than tweet?
WE DON'T NEED YOUR TEARS. WE NEED YOUR ACTION.
How will we overcome?  Things are getting worse every week. Congress needs to impeach this president. Now!
Impeach yourself! 
Enjoy the next 8 yrs :)
Time to push for impeachment!
Impeach him already.
Chris I'm embarrassed that you are representing my state. Your statements are made up and offensive. "Winked at Racists" unbelievable
You've been crying since election day, perhaps you'll still be crying next election.
That is a bold faced slanderous lie! Adhere to your oath and Ethics rules of the Senate immediately Senator!
Thank you for speaking up. Arapio tortured mentally ill people. He's a criminal. #TrumpCrimeFamily #ResignTrump #TrumpResign
Winked.... Loud and clear.... #Resist time to March in the streets
@POTUS most hated President ever
Crazy man trump is on the border line of being charged with genocide.. just watch what I'm saying he will go down...
Thanks, Chris. Glad to be from Md, and represented by you.
Trump wink huh, tell me why your Congressional district is filled with Democratic Party KKK members. The Klan put you in office.
Every day, #KlanPresident proves First Lady Obama's point: the presidency doesn't change who you are, it reveals who you are
He pardoned a law enforcement officer doing his job. Too bad he can't arrest the judge for trying to change a legally enacted law. Resign
Please Senator, mobilize congress. 45 is destroying our Republic
He was indicted by a liberally entrenched deepstate judge. You know the same people that pad your pockets.
Don't you have any friends across the aisle that you could convince to do the right thing and get this monster out of office?
Senator, please keep throwing this back to Republicans. They collectively own this. Without them, Trump is nothing.
You are not alone.
Hell yes, we'll overcome!

We're Americans. 
That's what we do. 

We got this.

Putin.
@ChrisVanHollen. You have a seat at the table.  DO SOMETHING.  Talk and no action, we are in crisis with 45 at the helm.
SICK!
Senator.... original
You sir are a damn liar
It is time to remove @realDonaldTrump from office. #ImpeachTrump #25thAmendment  I don't care how. Just do it. @WhipHoyer @SenatorCardin
It's sad you represent us in Maryland... "Trump's a racist.... Ya da ya da ya da.... does it ever get old?? Hint: it does for us!!!!
The time for crying is long past.
WHAT
IS
YOUR
PLAN??
I also cry, but I'll NEVER give up!!!
How much more of this HELL does our country need to endure ?
Trump did no such thing
He called for #trueaffection
If you weren't so partisan you'd see it
Joe Arpaio's crime is making criminals work

#ImpeachHimNow
You've lied so much you believe your lies.
Translation: "I am a sad troll who spams this same reply on multiple Dem Congresspeople's Tweets in the name of Cheeto Jesus."
Our only hope is the next election sees almost all GOP Congresspeople voted out. Except 3 of them.
We will survive this vile, inept man.
please tell me how!!!
You are wrong...Americans know the Truth. Why try to mislead?  Shame.
How!!??
Yes, we will #Resist & #persist until we remove this #Trump cancer. Then we will heal and become #StrongerTogether.

#JoeArpaio #RacistTrump
I am saddened too.... Truly, we are NOT in Kansas anymore....
It gives new meaning to "sickening."
Thank you,  many Americans are crying for our country.  America will overcome but at what price? #ImpeachTrump
#Sedition Look it up. You're crossing the line.
Practicing for himself and his family and cronies. #Shameful
Do you realize that trump could pardon all 2.5 million in jail.
Will we really overcome?
It's time to stop crying and start fighting
Thank you Chris. Keep up the good fight.
I hope you're right. I'm worried.
