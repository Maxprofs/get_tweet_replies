.@RepDonBeyer we could take action right now to save lives: #noflynobuy. No guns for domestic abusers. Ban assault weapons. #TalkGunSense
Requiring a license to buy a gun - just like you need one to drive - is proven to save lives. My bill: https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-sensible-state-based-answer-to-gun-violence/2015/07/28/f779dc0c-113a-11e5-9726-49d6fa26a8c6_story.html?utm_term=.70ff66cc9c8c … #TalkGunSense
@PostOpinions 1 problem. you have a right to defend yourself & your family, not drive a car
Sorry. "Shall not be infringed."
#gunsense
@ChrisVanHollen @washingtonpost
Driving is not a right. Owning a gun is! Moon Labe. @ChrisVanHollen
@washingtonpost Did licensing drivers stop car crashes or deaths? How bout car thefts? You're moving toward confiscation.
@PostOpinions The op-Ed is a non starter in any conversation about crime and firearms. Guns cannot act.
Extremely sad and pathetic to see MSM and elected leaders so blatantly ignorant where it concerns #2A
Any gun that reloads faster than once every 30 seconds is not in Founders Vision. 
 @HouseGVP @washingtonpost
Ha! Originalist, Scalia, decided to throw away 1st half of 2A! Said "militia" meant "individual".
@ChrisVanHollen @HouseGVP
1st half of 2A is an explanation, not a restriction of the right. Right is for the people @DRoberts556 @ChrisVanHollen @HouseGVP
2A: A WELL REGULATED MILITIA being necessary to the security a free state,...
NRA & Scalia say means individual.
BS!

@HouseGVP
Why are you so utterly dishonest as to not quote the part that actually described the right?  @HouseGVP
Damn it! Because the Gun side NEVER mentions it!!
It was all in the thread. You know. You were making the argument!
WTF?
"the Gun side" has actual scholarship. #gunsense has dishonesty http://www2.law.ucla.edu/volokh/common.htm …
Next: voting licenses, press licenses, religious freedom licenses. @ChrisVanHollen
It's unconstitutional thinking like this from MD legislators that made me finally leave that anti-gun pit. 
@PostOpinions
@PostOpinions There's zero proof this would save lives. Criminals don't obey the law. You're only harassing the law-abiding.
I take it you will also be introducing a voter ID law then?@ChrisVanHollen @PostOpinions
@PostOpinions Yep, that's sure going to fix the problem of straw purchasers, when you guys can't even enforce current laws.
#gunsense #guncontrol fraud @ChrisVanHollen deliberately conflates "buy/own" with "operate on public thoroughfare." #2A
@PostOpinions Won't this disenfranchise minorities? This is racist.
@PostOpinions you've taken an oath to support constitution yet don't know the difference between a right and a privilege?
@PostOpinions You realize what you're asking for right? Banning assault weapons = war with the American citizenry.
.@ChrisVanHollen Driving is not a right. However, if you force me to get a license, then I should be able to carry in all 50 states, right?
Where in the Constitution is there a right to drive? If you want to license 2A rights, then license right to vote.
@washingtonpost no it doesn't. Lies told often enough do not become true.
@washingtonpost  Chris, we support you at Leisure World. Great bill. Put Congress to work again: Vote Blue!
You are a liar, permit programs do nothing to "save lives" at all. Instead, they allow govt arbitrarily to deny rights.
@washingtonpost driving is a privilege owning a gun is a constitutional right. Would u support ID's to vote?
@TheSandmanSlim @ChrisVanHollen This is a totally spontaneous and not contrived #TalkGunSense convo:
@washingtonpost legally bought guns are not the problem. It is the criminals that are the problem. Like those in Congress
@washingtonpost Privilege vs. Right. Why does this need to be repeated? And proven by who?
Proven by who? Here's a better idea. Obey the laws. Obey the Constitution and put criminals in jail. Letting them out is bad
@washingtonpost  Only thing that is proven is ; places with leftist gun control are the most dangerous cities In the US
I prefer Constitutional Carry Laws!
@washingtonpost Sorry Chris voting for Kathy ..you have been in office way to long
@PostOpinions   Bull shit!
@washingtonpost driving a car isn't a right, owning a gun is. It is a grossly inaccurate comparison.
Why do you repeat debunked falsehoods? @ChrisVanHollen
@washingtonpost this is a lie. Prove it
our history has an answer for any license to exercise our Bill of Rights #TalkGunSense #2A
#TalkGunSense @ChrisVanHollen @washingtonpost Why stop with a license? How about mandatory liability insurance?
@washingtonpost  a license to enjoy a right? #failure
@PostOpinions driving is a privilege not a "right"!!!
@PostOpinions what about a right doing you get?  License needed for free speech?  License needed to vote?
@MarkAWebster1 @ChrisVanHollen @PostOpinions just create a license for everything. To buy food, talk, go outside your home
If you require a license to exercise your #2A rights, you will soon need one for your #1A rights. #MolonLabe 
@ChrisVanHollen @PostOpinions
Then why are there more car deaths than by firearms? Why does Balto, LA & ChiTown have such problems with ppl being shot?
@washingtonpost also where is this proof you hold?
people are getting their heads cut off and you want to make it harder for them to defend themselves?
#2A
@washingtonpost
@washingtonpost you don't need a license to BUY a car though. See the difference?
A constitutional right DOES NOT REQUIRE a license, you fascist.

#TalkGunSense
Driving is not a right. Sorry you don't (or pretend not to) understand that.
Faulty "Researchers compared Connecticut’s homicide rates" "with the rates that WOULD HAVE BEEN expected." Models SPECULATE.
.@ChrisVanHollen Requiring an ID to vote - just like you need one to drive - is proven to prevent #VoterFraud Do you have a bill for that?!?
Last I checked, there is no "Right to drive a car" in the constitution.
So what about people in inner cities that don't have a drivers license?
For a servant of the people you should know the difference between a Right and a privilege. Read ->
20K+ gun laws that R on books R not enforced. Licensing won't  help & neither will another law that bad guys won't follow.
guns are banned in Chicago, yet there's already been over 2000 shootings there this year. Nice try.
Will you require a license to vote? Or even an ID? #MAGA #TrumpPence16 #2A #MakeAmericaSAFEAgain
@washingtonpost Driving is not a constitutional right
@washingtonpost 
Good luck with that.
http://www.gunmap.org 
Save lives by killing less children lefty.
How DARE u deprive the poor their right to defend themselves by requiring license! Sound familiar? Hypocrite #TalkGunSense
@washingtonpost Driving is a privilege not a right...
@washingtonpost "Proven"
@washingtonpost qp
@PostOpinions saves no lives AT ALL. Aus and England banned guns, homicide and suicide rates stayed the same. Uninformed
My bill of rights says I don't need a licence to exercise a right that we will exercise with or without your consent
@washingtonpost Isn't that racist to require license to get guns, did you forget blk ppl can't get licenses
@PostOpinions  newsflash- bad guys do not need licenses.
.@ChrisVanHollen making it near impossible for Black families in inner cities to legally obtain guns to protect themselves is racist.
@PostOpinions  driving a car isn't a right.
This guy could use a little less red tape... 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFDOewMP9Eg …
@PostOpinions But you sure don't need any to get to vote! Hypocritical much?
@washingtonpost Lets talk about taking mine
NJ licensed firearms owners have a very low incidence of gun violence, stolen guns in the hands of criminals not so much...
@washingtonpost I know ppl without licenses who are better drivers than some with.
@PostOpinions driving isn't a right guaranteed by the US Constitution. And cars are more dangerous than guns.
@washingtonpost I think you should have to have a license for your first amendment rights
@washingtonpost apparently you don't need one to vote
@PostOpinions rightttt and it's totally unconstitutional.
This and Liablilty Insurance for the Weapon and the Ammunition.
Ill repeat: UNCONSTITUTIONAL. The End.
@washingtonpost Discrimination!  if voter id too hard for some,  then gun license even harder, i.e.: more discriminatory!
Can't manage private sales w/o registration.
Registration always precedes confiscation.
We will not comply.
#TalkGunSense
I just got a CCW. It was one 8 hour session. It's worth it.
@PostOpinions   Driving is a privilege, NOT a RIGHT protected by the Constitution.
@PostOpinions We should also need a license to vote. #TalkGunSense Oh, you mean voting is a Constitutional right.... 
@PostOpinions We'll get bills like this passed during Clintons first term.
@washingtonpost ones is protected by the constitution the other, not.
btw you go through a background check including showing your ID to purchase a gun
Well, that is racist! Asking for an ID! Not everyone has one....REMEMBER.
@PostOpinions Hey dummy criminals don't get license. How about 25yrs mandatory for crimes committed with firearm #gunsense
@washingtonpost  licence to exercise 2nd amendment is ok but an ID to exercise your right to vote is racist & bad? Hypocrisy
No democrat should be allowed to possess a firearm. I'd support that amendment.
@PostOpinions Apparently you have NO idea or respect 4 Second Amendment. A Right means no license needed. #totalitarianism
So criminals are going to get a gun license, maybe you can require a license to murder also!
@PostOpinions Chris pass a national voter ID ban ALL sanctuary cities and kick every illegal out of USA then call us #2A
License like Pilots. Number of people put at risk determines depth of screening, training reqmnts
@HouseGVP @washingtonpost
@PostOpinions Really! Can u see the criminals lining up! But now u can say u did something. Address the real issue sir!
@PostOpinions driving is not an enumerated right. What's next, a  License to vote?
Yes, especially if you don't vote the way they want you to vote.
Reason for NATIONAL gun laws. So straw dealers can't load up at out of state gun shows & sell in city.  @ChrisVanHollen
Maybe weak, but it's true. All you little Trumpettes come out with nothing but idiocy dripping down your shirts. Sad.
I will apolgize to you.
I will not apologize to someone who disrespects Prez cuz of his race which @safecracker111 does.
Trump could take a Saturday evening stroll through the southside of Chicago and explain to those voters his support for NRA
