@repjohnlewis @NancyPelosi Democracy is the system designed specifically for marginalizing minority views.
@JonathanRabbitt @repjohnlewis @NancyPelosi That's why the US is a REPUBLIC and not a Demoncracy. #RuleOfLaw
@geotopia Which is why they don't have jury trials for criminal cases?
@repjohnlewis @NancyPelosi
@JonathanRabbitt @repjohnlewis @NancyPelosi Juries must act on instructions from the Judge, the arbiter (hopefully) of law in the courtroom.
@geotopia Are the jurors peers of the defendant or members of the republic? Who is prosecuting?
@repjohnlewis @NancyPelosi
@JonathanRabbitt @repjohnlewis @NancyPelosi "Jury of your peers" and since jury duty requires citizenship, members of the republic, so both.
@geotopia Is the ruse the republic; or the assertions of an adversarial judicial process with impartial juries?
@repjohnlewis @NancyPelosi
@JonathanRabbitt @repjohnlewis @NancyPelosi The republic isn't a ruse, it's thusly constituted, it is what it is.
@repjohnlewis @SenWarren hello..girls howareyouuuuuuuuuuuuu  am fine light..

@repjohnlewis What has history taught us happens to empires when people cheat & become corrupt to stay in power or gain power. THEY FAIL!
@repjohnlewis @EnigmaNetxx If the GOP was proud of their core beliefs, I don't believe they would impede the ballot box & Gerrymandering
@rinkydnk2 @repjohnlewis 
They wouldnt Have to Use dirtyTricks IF they Had SKILLS
& Integrity.
.@repjohnlewis Finally saw Selma & your role in civil rights movement, it's a shame ppl take voting for granted now.
@repjohnlewis @BernieBrigade and a removal of all racist/bigots from all public offices/services of any kind. City, state and federal.
@repjohnlewis @JuliaBrownley26 In a just & fair society, non-citizens r prevented from cancelling out citizen votes.
@repjohnlewis Yet not one single word on this in the "debate." Could it be that they know that We know... and can Prove it?
@BettieRose100 You can not seek ways to restrict voting of US Citizens, and call yourself an American. You just can't do that!
@repjohnlewis @HouseDemocrats vote against Iran deal
@repjohnlewis @RepEliotEngel Is that what Eliot thought when he sold his vote 2 Netanyahu on Iran Deal.

Yes!

@repjohnlewis @jmhennessey when I said that Bernie deeply thought about this and that's why he said he will make the election day a holiday
@repjohnlewis @ALCollegeDemocrate it strength in numbers along with transprancy I will be the voice for the young democrats #invite me
@repjohnlewis There are no barriers 4 citizens 2 vote.  Ttruth is, non-citizens disenfranchise citizens at the voting booth. @IAmFreedomMan
@repjohnlewis @ZBanshee I will not sleep until ballot boxes are delivered to every country so they can vote. The world deserves US.
@repjohnlewis Who's blocking the ballot boxes?  Why haven't I heard of any examples except for the Black Panthers in Ohio? @RepCheri

@repjohnlewis @rmj_rosa Please Mr. Lewis work to make election day a national holiday. At least start the conversation.
@repjohnlewis Thank you John Lewis. Those who interfere with the Voting Rights of others understand its power. They are anti-democracy.
@repjohnlewis @HouseDemocrats-To include Obamas 5million illegal aliens?
@repjohnlewis @SenWarren How do airlines get away with asking for ID to get on planes? How about racist DNC convention where you need ID?
@NancyPelosi @repjohnlewis absolutely
@repjohnlewis john lewis I support you
@repjohnlewis @wilytone just as long as the Republicans can change the vote afterward like they have done since they found out how to do it.
@repjohnlewis you are insane.  It's the only way you can win is stuffing the ballot boz
@repjohnlewis @terri_georgia that's a death sentence for Republicans
@repjohnlewis @SenWarren what are some of the barriers?
@repjohnlewis I do not #agree
@repjohnlewis #Absolutely Agree with you Mr. Congressman Lewis.
@repjohnlewis @HouseDemocrats 
IMPEACH OBAMA NOW, WE THE PEOPLE DEMAND JUSTICE.
@repjohnlewis You are one person that I would most like to dine with. Thanks for everything you do, sir.
@repjohnlewis  Congress can kill $18T of #debt in 60years using just 15% of its $2T per yr income, would YOU conserve more or less than15%?
@repjohnlewis @SenWarren 

Implying that you mean "CITIZENSHIP"...
@repjohnlewis Especially barriers that keep people from voting because of race, age and income!
@repjohnlewis I strongly agree!
@repjohnlewis #RestoreTheVRA
@repjohnlewis @SenWarren: and removal of corporate participation in government. The IRS & Federal Reserve are the results of corporate greed
@repjohnlewis December 6, 2015. The 150 year anniversary of the 13th Amendment. #"13@150". We need to observe our success and failures!
@repjohnlewis @MrNegroMilitant People should be able to write in who they want, not just vote for those with enough money to get on ballot.
@repjohnlewis @loisjnv This is the No 1 truth for democracy. Anyone who impedes the voting process has to be un-American.
@repjohnlewis it also demands, as Joseph Stiglitz said "meaningful choisces". Without Bernie, there are no real choices .  #FeelTheBern
@repjohnlewis @EveryVoice YES SIR, IT IS.  BUT IT WON'T HAPPEN UNTIL A NEW BREED OF REPUBLICANS IS BORN....AND THAT WON'T HAPPEN, SIR! ;(
@repjohnlewis @SenWarren That is exactly why photo voter id is required!!!!
@repjohnlewis Thank you for LIVING the reality of the dream to get the Voting Rights Act signed into law. There is still a need for this law
@repjohnlewis yes, but more importantly Education is the foundation to being an informed voter.
@repjohnlewis @SenWarren You couldn't pass a civics class if your life depended on it. We are a Constitutional Republic not a democracy
@repjohnlewis @SenWarren You "folks" know the truth behind this,register and vote,1 vote per living person in 1district.Simple, show ID,vote
@repjohnlewis @SenWarren Auto-register all citizens when they reach 18 and make Election Day a national holiday #RestoreTheVRA
@repjohnlewis @SenWarren The barriers have been removed, just prove who you say U are and cast your vote in your precinct. Register and vote
@repjohnlewis @CecileRichards Transportation is a "barrier" for some.. so govt. should supply people w/ cars too. #liberallogic #liberalmath
And implement the Help America Vote Act!We’re still waiting... @repjohnlewis @CecileRichards
@repjohnlewis Voting is a sacred privilege and should be treated as such.  Not like handing out squares of toilet paper.  Voter ID a must!!
@repjohnlewis @CecileRichards 
REQUIRE AN I.Q. TEST FROM ALL VOTERS PRIOR TO CASTING A BALLOT.
SHIT! WAIT! THAT MEANS THE GOP WINS ...
@stephen16781577 @repjohnlewis @CecileRichards no the VA IQ test is for elected officials
@repjohnlewis Unfortunately GOP doesn't believe in equal access to the ballot box!
@repjohnlewis @SenatorDurbin nothing but dribble.  produce 'facts' where ppl are denied the right to vote or shut up.
@repjohnlewis when u r cheaters
. @repjohnlewis To all the critics: the VRA is about a lot more than IDs. Please read up on it. #RestoreTheVRA  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act_of_1965 …
@repjohnlewis funny, the second amendment is a protected right, but I bet you two dopes won't say this about #guns #2A

 @RepJohnYarmuth
@repjohnlewis @NancyPelosi glass stegall?

@repjohnlewis @USRepRickNolan There is no racial discrimination of LEGAL U.S. citizens.
@repjohnlewis Thank you for your work, legacy and advocacy in this area and for representing GA/ATL #VRA50 #RestoreTheVRA #CivilRights
@NancyPelosi @repjohnlewis You need an ID to drive or buy booze, not sure why this is so complex 4 you. Oh wait, yes I do, you're senile.
@repjohnlewis @RepBarbaraLee  include the black voter
@repjohnlewis so ur saying no one needs an id?
@repjohnlewis @SenSanders
2/2
agree with extended voting hrs
and pre voting as required in the area
no post election day voting though.
@repjohnlewis @SenSanders
As a volunteer poll worker
the ONLY way to know that the person presenting to vote is that persom.. is by id
1/2
@repjohnlewis: "Our vote is the foundation of democracy. A just &amp; fair society requires the…" #1 in United States http://www.toprt.com/TopRT_US/?t=629265088214638592 …
@repjohnlewis @SenSanders America should follow Oregon's lead and automatically register voters when they become eligible.
@repjohnlewis @TheDemocrats Absolutely! Thank you.
@repjohnlewis Serious Question: If u can vote without a gov issue ID, how do u know who was eligible to vote or how many times they voted?
@repjohnlewis Who isn't allowed to vote now?
.@repjohnlewis The ONLY reason to change voting laws is to make it EASIER to vote, not harder.Restore and expand the VRA to all 50 states
@gotmtv @repjohnlewis amen
@repjohnlewis  if id is required then id's should be free.
@repjohnlewis @SenSanders Restore integrity to our elections! GOP steals elections says a GOP expert! Search YouTube Stephen Spoonamore
@repjohnlewis Sir #RuthBaderGinsburg said not to throw away the #umbrella. Throw away the #CagingLists @JebBush permitted before #BushvGore.
@repjohnlewis  -- Thank you for saying the truth.
@repjohnlewis @JennMcClellanVA The biggest barrier to the polls is self imposed. A majority of Virginia voters will sit home in November.
@NancyPelosi @repjohnlewis 

 What does that mean, though? I can go from "blue" (cont) http://tl.gd/nkgg3m 
@repjohnlewis @WhiteHouse What R the barriers exactly? I want ALL eligible voters to vote! But registration & proper ID are essential
@repjohnlewis @WhiteHouse they rely on the ill informed or John Stewart
@repjohnlewis @WhiteHouse just like if you question the #IranDeal you agree with the Iraq war. #jedimindtricks
Make voting mandatory like Ecuador & you don't have that problem anymore. Like Jury "Duty" or military draft. @repjohnlewis @TheDemocrats
@repjohnlewis @NancyPelosi Then you need to ban the Black Panthers from polling places
@repjohnlewis don't drink the kool-aid!
@repjohnlewis but will say it's racism relying on the daily show crowd to shame everyone into allowing illegals to vote!
@repjohnlewis they think were idiots they will frame it as a black thing but in actuality they're really sneaking illegals in the booth!
MT“@repjohnlewis: vote is foundation of democracy; society requires removal barriers to vote #RestoreTheVRA”#HistoryNeverTakesSummerVacation
@repjohnlewis @WhiteHouse - lets don't let the dead democrats vote!
@repjohnlewis @WhiteHouse yes and my vote should be protect so it isn't canceled out by someone who isn't allowed to legal vote.  Require ID
@repjohnlewis @WhiteHouse  illegals too?
@repjohnlewis @HouseDemocrats 90M a year in salaries paid by us the tax payers and we can't find anyone more qualified than these dipshits
@repjohnlewis tom great point they keep saying we have a immigration problem BS you just walk across the dam border no problem here!!
@repjohnlewis Do you see how foolish your statement is. Again simplicity 1. Reg to vote 2. bring an ID 3. Vote you out of office
@repjohnlewis @WhiteHouse with ID you need it for everything else! Guess that's why we have the illegal immigration problem!  All you see is
@repjohnlewis @WhiteHouse   Like the need to be a citizen to vote, right?
@repjohnlewis why don't U explain to us idiots why a ID should NOT be needed to vote is an ID to much to ask to protect democracy
@repjohnlewis @NancyPelosi 15th amendment protects voting rights. Requiring a valid drivers license or ID is not a barrier.
@WhiteHousewill you follow me? @repjohnlewis
@repjohnlewis @WhiteHouse I agree but dead people shouldn't be able to vote
@repjohnlewis not when it openly encourages participation by non citizens. Your demagoguery fools no one. @WhiteHouse
@repjohnlewis @WhiteHouse 1960 wants their voting act back
.@repjohnlewis
If "our vote is the foundation of democracy" then integrity of votes needs to be guaranteed.
Your office requires ID to enter
@ConservaThreads @repjohnlewis my office provides the ID neccesary for me to enter.
@repjohnlewis @WhiteHouse  If A LIBERAL is For It, It's Likely Without Integrity
@repjohnlewis @WhiteHouse A just & fair society should also require the removal of barriers to #independent & alt party candidate #debates
@WhiteHouse @repjohnlewis lets invest in facilitating the people to comply with the new rules. Do it
@repjohnlewis @NancyPelosi WRONG it Requires that VOTERS be AMERICAN CITIZENS TO VOTE IN AMERICAN ELECTIONS IDs provided by govt already
@repjohnlewis ...
@repjohnlewis @NancyPelosi THE BALLOT BOX STARTS HERE @SheriffClarke @THEHermanCain @GovernorPerry @tedcruz
@repjohnlewis What barriers? Anyone eligible to vote, can. @NancyPelosi
@repjohnlewis @NancyPelosi You mean that without illegal aliens voting Demolibs would get no where.
@repjohnlewis You are absolutely correct! Any thing that prevents Americans from voting, is a crime against democracy!
@RacerXRoberts @repjohnlewis It's a crime against democracy when illegals & fraudulent voters get to cancel out American votes!
@repjohnlewis Everybody, get out and vote, too! #p2 #UniteBlue
@repjohnlewis everyone can't vote, should be with ID.
@repjohnlewis @NancyPelosi what demagoguery! You simply need to prove that you have the right to vote. Is that really asking too much?
@repjohnlewis @CommonCause You will have to get the fascist off the Supreme Court first.
.@repjohnlewis Thank you for your work to make the #VotingRightsAct a reality, and your work today to #RestoreTheVRA. #VRA50
@CommonCause @repjohnlewis Everybody, get out and vote, too! #p2 #UniteBlue
@repjohnlewis I concur #RestoreTheVRA
