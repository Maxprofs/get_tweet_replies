BaaaaHaaaa!
Yeah, your countrymen dying due to lack of access to affordable healthcare is hilarious. That's why they call you deplorables.
Gosh, you are so informed. If people who have never worked didn’t receive free Medicaid,there would be no problem for working man/Medicare.
Something from your timeline:
Hummmm. If you say so. Gnight.
They are all heartless assholes
Sorry for being so blunt, Chris
It's enough to make me sick-- except now I won't be able to afford to be sick.
Stop this crape we can't take anymore medicare or medicade I draw733amonth you trump should live on that
You need to fix your spell correct don’t really know what you are trying to say.
I do like how Evil @GOP no longer even tries pretending they care about anything than their pimps. I mean donors.
BRILLIANTLY PUT!
This bill needs to be laid out in black and white for everyone to judge. NO MORE GIVEAWAYS!!!
If CONGRESS had kept their hands out of Medicare budget, we wouldn't be here, but they STOLE THAT MONEY from workers who paid into system!
Yeah you can thank Bill Clinton for that!
I don’t get it - the Republicans want to INCREASE the deficit??? That is so unRepublican sounding.
Then the country will need a democrat to clean up the mess. Lower taxes on the rich, increase the #Deficit. Repeat, rinse
If you’re middle class or poor, rely on Medicare/Medicaid & you’re still voting for republicans-U need 2 check your brain. Racism destroys u
Cuz they NEED it so much....the 1%!
Y'all been wrong about almost every prediction on Trump policies so far... What makes you think you're right on this one?
Call it what it is: tax cuts w/money going to the wealthiest combined w/ stealth repeal of #healthcare for millions of Americans.
Why every time tax cuts for the middle class you all come out and start saying it’s a give away to the rich and ruin it? I need relief!
If you take away benefits from those that don’t require it you save on the budget. Stop giving out money you don’t have!
q
yeah, I am a 66 yr old woman who has paid into medicare and I won't forget this
Facts
Wait until those (including me) see their increase in Medicare go up-how many of you voted for DJT cuz u thought he was John Wayne
Both parties are corrupt.
HoldTheRepublicanPartyPoliticians Responsible for the #CUTS2 #Medicare&Medicaid this and EveryOtherElectionDay! TheCharlesAndDavidKochParty
Why are you all crying about Medicare and Medicaid read the damn bill! No cuts to Medicare.
Illegal Obamacare subsidies to rich corporate insurers isn’t a tax break for rich corporations?
You go! Expose their dirty little secrets! Remember to big to fail?
Yeah Im supposing the tripled health care premiums will make the middle class tax cuts kinda moot.
The roughly $60 someone in my tax bracket will receive???????
Yup. But what can I do about it?  I expect my elected democratic leaders to fight, fight, fight.  I vote.  I participate.
Not enough people voted Dem: that & gerrymandering. Very frustrating to just sit & watch this budget pass. Dems can't even filibuster this.
I completely agree, especially about gerrymandering.
I can't wait to see how this turns out when his gun toting base find out they don't have Medicaid, Healthcare and their food stamps cut.
News flash those are democrates! Trump supporters actually pay taxes!
Every TaxCutBreak TheBillionaires Get is More Money Used to Bribe our AllTooWillingPoliticiansPartys! TheCharlesAndDavidKochParty @RNC @GOP!

Wonder if the lower working classes and those in the rust belt who thought Trump was their savour are now thinking  otherwise ?
Funny, that's not actually true.
Pesky  #FACTS
HOW could this NOT have been loudly PROTESTED so they didn’t dare pass it, one might wonder.
Help? What can we do! #TOMprice gonna pay back airfare of one million? And the others!
Misty-eyed @SpeakerRyan will then seek even larger cuts to Social Security as #GOP inflicted deficit balloons ‘coz “deficits are so unfair”
I can watch cartoons for a laugh. Yours is not necessary
This is criminal with so many people relying on Medicaid and Medicare. To give tax breaks to the wealthy is just wrong. So much for pro life

Not to mention it increases the deficit. I thought Trump promised not to add to  deficit or cut medicare/medicaid.
Is there a tax bracket that does NOT benefit from the proposed tax cut?
Yes, poor & middle class will see their taxes increase.
Keep in mind the Wealthy people who structure their estate using lawyers to qualify for Long Term Medicaid, State and Federal dollars 
I will remember.
Frankly-until GOP dies-we the people need to have a tax strike. We have had enough corruption @SenJohnMcCain @SenateDems
Senator, that comes out to about 1,000 per Medicare recipient per year.  That's a massive cut.  That will hurt people!
We'd like Congressional slaves to be minimum wage Walmart workers, or drafted for war. We'd let you choose.
It annoys me that the DNC is very slow to point that out

@KellyFritscha 
A cut for a tax break. Hmm how does this even sound right or be??? That's not finding ways to save its wrong
How can you give a tax break to any who aren't willing to take a cut themselves
For all you so called experienced politicians in Congress, "Tax cuts don't have to be paid for!"  Tax cuts increase revenue to the treasury.
Your turn to get pissed MAGAts! 
They're coming for you 
Your $, healthcare.....
@iamfonda 
1/2  45 promised he wouldn't touch Medicare "because you've earned that."
@iamfonda 
2/2 Only news past couple of weeks has now included Medicare. Another campaign lie?
What’s there cut of the blood money ?
Can we stop paying taxes now?
Too many people on Medicaid and too many collecting disability who are NOT #disabled
Yes, your life is now gifted to a plutocrat. You are a slave. You just don't know yet.
That’s what the American people voted for. We will have to wait till the storm is ove to count our dead.
Not a good decision
I hate the President.
I hate this country.
People seem to have forgotten this will hit seniors in nursing homes...
I does not cut current Medicare/Medicaid at all!
8% less tax to rich meaning they get 80 thousands $ from government. Salaried will pay government more. Poor poorer. Cut all loopholes 4rich
When the party in power is beholden to the donor class and ignores the vast majority of Americans, do we truly have a democracy?
no one believes u clowns on the economy...u have clue what u are doing as a party other than using supposed social injustice as a weapon
They are on the radio making it sound like the middle class & poor are getting this huge benefit. Hope Dems expose it for what it is, a lie.
Not to mention limiting tax advantaged 401k contributions to $2400/year. You read that right. Poverty for us and $$$ for the Donor Class.
Sure, but no matter how much @GOP shamelessly works to line their own pockets, at least for today, they can’t take it with them; #UnHolyScum
Insane taking funds away from those most in need. Why hasn’t there been any review/revision to Medicare in years & why aren’t RX cost nego?
Do whatever you can to stop the Republicans!
Children are already quietly being kicked off CHIP in Ohio.
Pay attention folks! Remember this info!
Good, next year we can switch all of you for some that work for the people.
Remember this fact: The Republican budget cuts Medicare by $473 billion and Medicaid by over a trillion to give tax breaks to the wealthy,..
Trumpers will be like:
They should be ashamed of themselves.  I hope there is a God so they go to hell
He told everyone tax breaks, maga, etc. Meanwhile, its operation snow job. The wealthy dont neeeeeed a tax break!
I copy that
Shameful!
That hammer still beating in your head?
I work with people who have Medicaid - my salary is paid by Medicaid- will I loose my job?
Medicare only pays 80% of SOME healthcare (0 of others). We worked for that. So Trump tries again to kill the SR citizens & disabled!
Disgraceful
Repubs raison d'etre for decades has been to destroy the social safety net - couldn't do it thru healthcare bill so . . .
That awkward moment when your government is cashing in on your illnesses.
We should let GOP donors know how disappointed we r w/ their flunkies in Congress. Some nice little shock to their stock prices wld be nice.
I need long-term care...I'm sure I'll remember. #MedicaidMatters
#2018
Looks like they found a lot of waste.  Explain the cuts.
And there’s not a damned thing we can do about it!
Stop scaring people no one believes you
I hate them.
How many golf breaks can that pay for?
What can I do to help?
Very sad!! What about using the budget to open up drilling in the Arctic?? Please oppose! #nodrilling
Now that GOP got their RICHtax break is trump now IMPEACHABLE
You've GOT to make sure this doesn't pass!!
You are so full of malarkey it’s not funny. YOU are “richer” than the majority of your constituents. How much did you Ocare premiums rise?
We Dems expect our representatives to make sure this is WIDELY known. Most people affected are not very active on social media.
Why are Dems paving a way for this? Lobbyists?

2/2 So much for Reb claims of "Lower Spending" Cleverly disguised tax breaks to 1% will blow "YUGE" hole in deficit! Where r hawks NOW?
1/2 We'll NEVER forget! Disheartening that the Rebs, we THOUGHT had a concience, obviously don't and look to screw the 99% into a hole
THIS is 2 weeks after they DEFUNDED 9 million CHILDREN from HC.
Or brining retired generals to stack the military on his favor ?!!!
We will remember if we are not all dead.
The last thing you want to do is to piss off the old folks. They see a trip to the voting booth as a way to get even.
Well, I think the Koch brothers need more money. you know, how can you live on 10 billion ea? (Prob more?) They are lucky we allow this
How can I forget? My family relies on both.
@realDonaldTrump @VP @POTUS @WhiteHouse @SpeakerRyan @MitchMconnell ALL OF YOU  HATEFUL UNCARING SOB'S  HUNGRY DECEITFUL BETTER WATCH OUT 
We must make sure the wealthy have enough milk money so they can keep on milking the country.

Repeal and replace @GOP ! VOTE BLUE 2018!!!
This isn't the first or the last time we will stand up and fight for what is ours, we did this in the 60's when we fought against the war.
WHY AREN'T PEOPLE MORE UP IN ARMS ABOUT THIS?!?I AM 6MO. FROM GOING ON MEDICARE&DESPAR. NEED IT!!! YOU ALL WILL NEED SOMEDAY TOO-OUTRAGEOUS
CALL YOUR REPS NOW-THEY WANT TO DEFUND MEDICARE AND MEDICAID&SS IS NEXT AND ELDERLY DIE&BE HOMELESS-THIS IS NOT OK! STOP BEING DISTRACTED!!
I've paid in for Medicare via payroll taxes my whole life. Taking my money and handing it to the 1% is bullshit.
Stop hating cause maybe in 20-30 years that money is going to trickle down to us and then who going to look stupid for criticizing.
I've paid into Medicaid (SSDI) & Medicare for 43 years and had 35 surgeries, 3 cancers, & multiple medical conditions. They want to kill me?
They can't get away with it
I wish I could retweet this fact to every American, especially those "special" folks who still believe anything #DotardTrump says.
Forget about MOTUS the real devils are the repubs who have sold their souls.. must b voted out to save our democracy
Budget details have been lost in media coverage of Trump's latest fiascos. This budget is horrendous. Take back Congress in '18! #VoteBlue
Congrats on writing a great house tweet! http://greathousetweets.measuredvoice.com/ChrisVanHollen/status/921160252610969607 … (Ranked 7th for Oct 19.)
#TaxCutsForTheRich #KochBrosOwnGOP
We still need a president that is going to put Social Security benefits in a lockbox so GOP can’t rob our mothers and fathers
Like the @GOP or @realDonaldTrump care about people. Unless they can help them! Ideology over humanity!
About $500 in healthcare per person—quite a lot of money, really
You show me in the Bill where it says that? More spin by the Democrats & Liberals! The only cut will be not forcing a bad ACA on them!
Repeal of the estate tax, only paid on estates of $5.49MM+ will leave a large revenue shortfall the rest of us will have to pay.
What will I do?? I'm terrified 
@tedlieu @Acosta @POTUS @JoyAnnReid @DavidCornDC @RWPUSA @KeithOlbermann @SocialPowerOne1 @kylegriffin1 @AdamParkhomenko @tribelaw @donlemon
Both parties have failed the poor for decades. The lingering poverty and despair is indictment of Republicans and Democrats.
Great job @realDonaldTrump @GOP - take away the most $$ from your base #mags #not / as usual gop all about the rich
Your old Democrat lie of it benefits the wealthy no longer is believed. If you ever had a real job was the job giver poor?
S T O P
Their policy backs up their bigoted views on how to OPRESS anyone that isn't a rich white male. Taking away our opportunities 2 get ahead
Lets put a stop to this!
How long are we going to let this go on. What happened to for the people by the people

These cuts will greatly impact the quality of life for those over 65, and those nearing retirement. Choose your political leaders wisely.
Want to be a fly on the wall, when granny has to move in with her GOP kids after getting kicked out of the nursing home. #grannyiscominghome
We should all be outraged by this!
Why is this being allowed to happen. Why can't they be stopped
@AARP @votevets @RWPUSA @PalmerReport @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems this needs to b stopped.
You say that as if the GOP cares.
It should be clear now why there is an emotional controversy as the MSM news story while the GOP agenda moves forward.
One might think unemployment was 15%. And people were just hanging around getting sick for the fun of it.
So the Republicans are selling out our elderly and sick so the wealthy can’t get tax breaks. Is this a America we want?
#March Enough is enough people.
What would you like us to do, we did not get to vote.
Stealing from the poor to give to the rich evil
Your statement about budget cuts to medicare are not incorrect. But what substance and actions do you have in favor of the people?
You also have not co-signed or campaigned for #MedicareForAll which is the antidote to the Republican health plan.
You voted YES to give Donald Trump roughly 2x what he asked for in the military budget increase. https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/115-2017/s199 … Why?
@SenToomey Shame.
#NoTaxcutforBillionaires
Over 10 years Mr #Fakenews Enough whining and embarrassing the state of Maryland .@chrisvanhollen
Well you're my representative... faxing you today.
Did the budget pass?
The Republican Party is a terrorist organization. #GOPTerrorists
Absolutely sickening. #TheResistance
I'm old enough to remember when Medicare, Medicaid, & Social Security were the Third Rail of politics.  And I ain't that old.
Hey dummy giving tax breaks to the wealthy is how people like Bill Gates HIRE PEOPLE!
I see TV ads from the R side on this all the time. Where are the Democratic ones?
That’s why it’s going to fail
There's a rule that says Medicare increases cannot reduce Soc Sec payments. I guess that will go. After 3 yrs w/no increase. Sigh.
But you pay for Medicare out of social security so...
There's a little teeny part of Medicare, an easy target of the GOP, that is keeping me from having a stroke. Other than that, no worries.
I worry all the time, l remember my mom's words their 4 the grace of God go I. Its T  children & ppl with disabilities, cancer thy will die.

This is something that the Dems must talk about everyday.

Not to mention it ads trillions to the deficit.
And they still won't be happy.Wish the corrupt 1% would go buy them an island somewhere and let US have our country back. We can do it w/o U
What will Dems do? @JoyAnnReid @JoeNBC @chrislhayes @RepAdamSchiff @ChrisMurphyCT
Please do every procedural thing possible to stop this horrible budget & worse tax cut. Please save Medicare & key programs. More Pressers!
How is Medicare going to be cut?  I keep reading about the $473 billion but what does it mean to those of us over 65?
Nobody has ever cut it before I don't think.
Repukes R determined 2 destroy Medicaid,enrich the rich,harm the middle & struggling class,destroy unions & reward corruption.This is maga ?
Don't forget  the disabled and elderly
Lol,I can’t forget.Im both disabled & elderly.Actually my group of citizens will B worse hit & this after paying in2 the system 4 decades.
Exactly! How can they loot the money we, and our employers have paid in. I’ve been working since I was 15.
Me to.Started working at around 17. Worked all my life till became disabled at 62.Paid in 45 years.
Yes indeed. I had three jobs at the age of 16, because I wanted a car. I worked every day since until spinal injury 6 years ago.
Lol. Same here.I wanted a car & my own place.Started working my 1st real jobs at 17 in factory’s in LA Ca.
#StarveTheBeast
  Dems need 2 run ads telling people what happens if budget is passed! GOP running ads on how people benefit from tax cuts! #DemsProtectUs
@GOPTreason and cruelty has no limits.
Tell us what are they doing. They have done it before.
Who are the wealthy again?
Warren Buffet bought 38.6 percent of @PilotFlyingJ,  and will increase that to 80 percent In 2023. A Truck Stop
Pretty much, and give most of the middle class higher taxes.
After watching how hospitals charge and bill differently for anyone on Medicare, the whole program is a sham.
