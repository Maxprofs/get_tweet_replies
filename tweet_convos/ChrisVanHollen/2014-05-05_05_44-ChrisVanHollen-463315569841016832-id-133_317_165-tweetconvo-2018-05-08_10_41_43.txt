.@NancyPelosi I'm insured for the first time in my adult life, and so are my husband and kids.
@notmuchelse @NancyPelosi And who's paying for that?
.@outlaw315 Me. It costs $166 a month. @NancyPelosi
@notmuchelse @NancyPelosi Give it a couple more years and then let us know again, how much its costing you. Rude awakening coming!
.@outlaw315 In which case I would be back where I was before Obamacare. Even a few years of insurance is better than none. @NancyPelosi
@notmuchelse @NancyPelosi And you'd still back these Idiots who apparently would have been found to be Lying about its cheap price.
.@outlaw315 I've got $166 insurance for a family of four today. Nobody lied. It's affordable! @NancyPelosi
@notmuchelse @NancyPelosi Again...will you back the Idiots in 2 to 3 years when your premiums skyrocket? LIED! "...u can keep ur Dr...Ins"
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse great job loading up the Medicaid ranks even faster to bankrupt the system !
@DividendMaster Which medical insurance do you use? Do you know anyone who benefits from Medicaid? @NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse
@smrzle @NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse Same people getting Medicaid get EBT , Obamaphones ,etc . Who pays for them ?
@DividendMaster The lifeline program for phones began during the Reagan administration. George W Bush updated it to include cellphones. Yay!
@smrzle do you know what " Work Force Participation Rate " is and why its plunging ? or why the numbers of so called disabled skyrocketing?
@DividendMaster Why not acknowledge what I shared? Did you know that the lifeline program began during Reagan?
@smrzle @DividendMaster | True or not, it's irrelevant. Wrong is wrong. We can't give free things to everyone just because they don't have.
@PeeteySDee @smrzle oh no Peter .... you gonna catch deep shit now . The bottomfeeders feel entitled to endless free stuff under Obama
@NancyPelosi  She does not realize that 13.4 % is Millions of People.  She does a lousey Job
@NancyPelosi @RepCummings LIAR! LIAR! LIAR! WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THOSE "SIGNED UP" HAVE ACTUALLY PAID THEIR PREMIUMS? LYING B-TCH!
@NancyPelosi These numbers are skewed just like the national unemployment rate at 6.3%, while 91M Americans are really under or unemployed!
@NancyPelosi but how many dropped out of work force?? reports are 800,000

@GOP #tcot #GWB #cheney
@NancyPelosi Do you actually thing people believe this BS?  Why don't you show us a chart of your net worth rising Nancy?
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse hahahaha, since before the ACA??? So how does that prove it works?
@NancyPelosi Not much progress I'd say Nancy.  Is that the best your Progressive bull S can do?
@NancyPelosi I'm loving the ACA. I'm a proud American.
@NancyPelosi u made a law requiring   us to have insurance     making thing much better for  insurance company profits
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse Huh? Which poll are you looking at? 67% of 8 million, with 37% insured but lost it. Due to the ACA. =1.1%
@NancyPelosi so we have more people on #Medicaidexpansion why shake up the whole #Healthcare system to add millions to Medicaid?
@NancyPelosi. everyday I meet people who are insured for the first time.  ;)
@NancyPelosi more lies
@NancyPelosi nothing like lowering the bar
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse This pig faced troll is a symbol of American political cowardice
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse ...My beloved, there are more work to be done, so the rate can get lowered.
@NancyPelosi Thank you. Now several of my friends have Medi-Cal when they had nothing before.
@NancyPelosi What is it called when a government MANDATES that citizens purchase products from a third party? Idon't think it's #victory
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse JUSTICE FOR BENGHAZI!!!
.@NancyPelosi Any reason you have zero interest in finding out the truth as to why our Ambassador & 3 others were slaughtered? #Benghazi
@NancyPelosi 
Hi Nancy , we are coming up on the hill tomorrow hoping to see you. Sherry Goldman, NBCC.
@NancyPelosi Americans coverage for medications & cancer tests has also dropped. #Obamacare is NOT working.
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse  today westing my time looking for a good doctor (I have Obama care insurance Emblem Health)
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse 27,5$ trilions dolara ko poseduje i u kojoj banci se prenosi taj problem.
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse  everyone has Obama care insurance but most good doctors not willing to accept it ..
@NancyPelosi more BS from the queen of BS! Libs Keep drinking the Kool-aid this fool is selling!
@NancyPelosi shut up woman you're drunk.
@NancyPelosi ...my feet need washed...
.@NancyPelosi @HealthCareTara
Avg Uninsured under Obama= 16.5
http://www.gallup.com/poll/168821/uninsured-rate-drops.aspx …
Avg Unisured under Bush= 14.5%
.@NancyPelosi @HealthCareTara $1.4Trillion to insure additional 6 Million?That cost taxpayers $234,000 per newly insured!!
@NancyPelosi Don't pay any attention to the 250+ million Americans screwed over by ObamaCrap.....
@NancyPelosi Congrats on getting it back into Bush territory. #pathetic
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse compare that to a Drone strike chart. Insurance down, drone strikes up.
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse finally something to compare to the Bush years. That only took 5 years!
@NancyPelosi @RepDianaDeGette  it's amazing the results when your forced to do something or pay fines! #onestepforward #twostepsback
@NancyPelosi ACA law force coverage but most in Medicaid so costs put everyone more in debt = end Free Mkt jobs + Inflation so people poorer
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse please keep us informed on #RenewUI seams no one is doing a thing to push it through or keep us in the loop
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse That is fantastic. Now a move to social insurance by progressive taxation for health and welfare?
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse Why haven't healthcare charges dropped? Part of our costs were explained as covering unpaid expenses of uninsured.
@NancyPelosi #Lies #Benghazi #BenghaziCoverUp #JusticeForBenghazi4 #Hillary2016 #HillaryClinton #ImpeachObama
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse But actual healthcare is still a mess. Guess you don't know differnce healthcare and health insurance
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse Only because you forced people to do it!
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse go learn math. you simple,pathological,neurological sociopath.
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse So basically you wasted billions of dollars to get back to what GWB did without wasting all that money.  Wow....
@NancyPelosi you are a sick individual! You and your party are totally disconnected from the American people!
@NorthSafeHouse @NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse HAHAHAAAAAA EXCELLENT!
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse You mean the lowest since George Walker Bush?  :-P
@StevenDiMartino @NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse nancy is too stupid to see the irony in that LOL
@NancyPelosi @WhiteHouse Great news for the insurance industry huh. Not so much for people who are paying more for less care than last year.
@NancyPelosi So you are bragging about the uninsured rate falling back to what it was during the last year of Bush, and claiming a success?
@NancyPelosi If accept that this is lowest rate since Q1 of 2008, doesn't that mean Obamacare is the reason the rate went up since?
@NancyPelosi So it's where it was when Bush was in office.  Great
@NancyPelosi @CarolsakelCosta oh-oh... You said the 4 letter word the dems hate to hear W-O-R-K, they prefer their freebies
@NancyPelosi you should just stop tweeting. You are probably the most hated politician in history. And the responses to ur tweets proves it.
@NancyPelosi I think you are brain dead....
@NancyPelosi @CarolsakelCosta you still need to get a clue
@TonyBarbose @CarolsakelCosta @NancyPelosi Basic human decency is a prerequisite. Might be awhile, if ever.
@DonnaStatkus @CarolsakelCosta @NancyPelosi Agree.  A brain helps but no one ever proved liberals were smart
@NancyPelosi @janschakowsky How long did it take to find a graph to fit your agenda? What was the source of the data to support the graph?
.@NancyPelosi @RepJohnYarmuth Keep striving to reach out; though its not easy. your efforts are not in vain. Humanity needs Health Care!
@NancyPelosi BS! Liar!
@NancyPelosi America's uninsured rate dropped to 13.4%, the lowest since 1/2008.

--> In other words, lowest since Bush years.
@instapundit
@NancyPelosi Some Seniors and disabled must pay up tp 33 of income for coverage.
See
http://queensbridge.us/ 
@NancyPelosi u know we didn't have ACA in 2008, right?  Your logic makes zero sense.
@NancyPelosi you must believe everyone's IQ is as low as yours must be.
@NancyPelosi WE don't want to hear about "uninsured rate or tattoos" WE NEED A LIFELINE #RenewUI WHERE YOU AT THOUGHT YOU HAD OUR BACKS?
@NancyPelosi who's in the White House ?
@NancyPelosi @askgeorge #ACAworks “What good is coverage if you can’t use it?” http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/04/18/consumerwatch-some-covered-california-patients-say-they-cant-see-a-doctor/ …
@NancyPelosi @ChrisVanHollen So it continually increased throughout Obama's term, and now we're just getting back to Bush numbers? #ACAworks
@NancyPelosi @RepJohnYarmuth Strange how people act when their gov threatens them with fines.
@NancyPelosi so it dropped to the level before it went in affect??  Wow we could have saved trillions of dollars by doing nothing...
@NancyPelosi @RepCummings Hahaha, that's funny.  You'll see what we think of ACA in Nov
@NancyPelosi @RepCummings mostly medicaid states cover that will crater their budgets. Studies show Medicaid is worse care than no ins.
@NancyPelosi #Benghazi #Benghazi WHO SAID IT WAS A VIDEO? FOUR #AMERICANS DIED #Benghazi #Benghazi
@NancyPelosi @RepLindaSanchez lowest since OBama took office, how about before Obama?
@NancyPelosi FIND THE PEOPLE THAT KILLED 4 AMERICANS IN BENGAZI !!
@NancyPelosi @RepEBJ well, I guess that's not too bad considering that the IRS is practically holding a gun to everyone's head if they don't
@NancyPelosi WOOO an insurance card. Money well spent you moron !

@NancyPelosi: President Obama could cure CANCER and conservatives still wouldn't believe it because it came from "HIM".
@GeeSungee @NancyPelosi I'll give him props! It only took 7 yrs for him to get the rate back down to where it was when he took over.
@jmorris96310 @NancyPelosi: Good for you! As for ME he was the worst president EVER. And he only gave tax breaks to the top 2% and
@GeeSungee @NancyPelosi I'm against all income tax.
@jmorris96310 @NancyPelosi: Against all income tax?! Then how are we supposed 2 pay for things like roads, schools, libraries, etc.
@GeeSungee @NancyPelosi Did you know America didn't have any income tax until 1914? Income tax only been around for 50yrs  when I was born.
@NancyPelosi  Numbers don't lie but LIARS use numbers. The American Communist Act is a lie.
@NancyPelosi  is that seen as positive indicator or negative?
@NancyPelosi ACA doesn't work. Too many newly insured getting the feeble at the expense of the tax paying working Americans. #killaca
@NancyPelosi What happens after the elections in Nov & #KingObama enforces the remaining parts of the law. @TheDemocrats deceive. Period.
“@NancyPelosi: America's uninsured rate has dropped to 13.4%,  lowest since 1/2008! #ACAworks http://goo.gl/QiAUln  ”
@NancyPelosi TOMASSO says that = 43.5 MILLION W/O?  With much free & #subsidized ins avail via #ACA (just #lie on app), Y not all? #LIES?
@NancyPelosi Yay so happy! Oh wait, there is still 36 ish million still without. #JobNotWellDone
MT @NancyPelosi: America's uninsured rate has dropped to 13.4%, the lowest since 1/2008! #ACAworks ///

@NancyPelosi It's the right thing. Just needs time and a few wise fixes.
@NancyPelosi I won't be satisfied until it is 0%. #medicareforall
.@NancyPelosi I believe this as much as I believe the unemployment rate. #LIAR
@NancyPelosi Most ppl won't meet their huge deductibles, on top of now paying for premiums. Way to go, genius.
@NancyPelosi 21/2 TIMES AS MANY FELL OUT OF WORK FORCE AS JOBS CREATED...YOUR LIVING IN DREAMLAND @NancyPelosi
@NancyPelosi This would be good news if those with new coverage paid their premiums and weren't subsidized by those of us who actually work.
@NancyPelosi Are you covered under ACA? Were you uninsured before ACA? How much is your premium? Have you lost your doctor/insurance? tw
@NancyPelosi ba ha ha!
@NancyPelosi Nancy. There's 92mil Americans out there that wanted @BarackObama to get this economy going not implement a DNC pet project...
.@NancyPelosi Using the old questions?
or the New & Improved Obama questions on Health insurance coverage?
