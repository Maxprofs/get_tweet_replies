@ChrisVanHollen you talk about fairness in the select committee. Talk to Harry Reid about the Nuclear Option. You Democrats are hypocrites.
@ChrisVanHollen like the constant rule changes ur dictator messiah keeps doing with odumbocare? kettle calling what? liberal=lies=hypocrisy
@ChrisVanHollen Show this video as well from Rachel Maddow: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn13MMJ5pPs … GOP calling for a Shut-Down, Pls ReTweet it!
@FatChickinLA Thanks a lot for RT. I think this is The Most Descriptive Illustration of circumstances leading up to shutdown! Thanks...
@DaveKelley6 I tweeted it earlier and have it on my tumblr, I know it won't get the coverage it needs.
@FatChickinLA Right, thanks. I remember watching the night she showed it, and thinking, that really needs to get around. Whatever we can do
@DaveKelley6 The more people that see it the better imo :)
@FatChickinLA Absolutely, that's exactly what I'm thinking.
@ChrisVanHollen If you don't understand the bill, we need to get someone that does.
@ChrisVanHollen Most of your tweets are dumping (not very fairly) on the GOP.  Any concrete thoughts of your own?  Or just continue whining?
@ChrisVanHollen You are a badass! :)
@ChrisVanHollen @sspip77 You should be fired for Creating a Hostile Work Environment Do your job and grow up

@ChrisVanHollen you want a 50-50 on select committee. How about when Republicans were LOCKED OUT of the Obamacare meeting. Again hypocrites.

@ChrisVanHollen Seriously Chris Rule Change? Hello @SenatorReid changes Rules Senate every day doesn't allow Amendments & Nuke Option LMAO
@ChrisVanHollen @MargieforKs Lynn Jenkins voted for that rule change.
@ChrisVanHollen Is that like, "You have to pass it to find out what is in it"? You are PATHETIC!
@ChrisVanHollen @SilenceDoGoodV2 @RobotViewPoint Listen very carefully to this video! Listen to it and form your own opinion. Read between!
@ChrisVanHollen @SilenceDoGoodV2 @RobotViewPoint Amazing how Republicans have altered the laws in this country in an undiplomatic way!
@ChrisVanHollen Chris all you do is name call, what would you tell your children .. followed you lead in groups they represent, be like you?

@ChrisVanHollen Thanks for the video exposing the GOP rigging.  Will they hold us hostage again in January with this dirty 'rule'?
Ty @ChrisVanHollen we noticed because you went to bat for all of us sleeping taxpayers.
@ChrisVanHollen Can we initiate a recall of all Rep's who amended House standing rule in order to thwart democratic process? We must act!

@ChrisVanHollen nice theatrics and "inquires" on #rulechange; why not put that much effort towards a solution? #shutdown #partisanship

@ChrisVanHollen If this isn't a crime, is it at least a tort? It seems to have the elements; act, intent, & injury. #UniteBlue #EndThisNow
@FlaminLib It's Sedition at most, Treason at least. Where are the lawyers? Are they all bought off?
@GrainOfSands This warrants an investigation. Could we at least bring suit against the GOP? And Speaker Boehner?
@FlaminLib Absolutely
