@HelloMurica @WhiteHouse Are u serious? They ARE lives cut short by gun violence. Guns in homes increase the odds of a 'successful 'suicide.
@HelloMurica @WhiteHouse What rights? So you have your background checked at gun shows. What are you hiding? You can still by your guns.
@pfd572 @HelloMurica @WhiteHouse ..Give an inch,they will slowly take a mile,pretty soon the 2nd Amendment will be history,and crime cont's.

@WhiteHouse @HawkDiesel1906 unconstitutional. Can't vote him out fast enough
@OmahaWarpath @WhiteHouse agree to disagree but I'm all about the @Redskins!!!
@HawkDiesel1906 @WhiteHouse fair enough. However it is completely accurate that it is unconstitutional. Read up on it.
@OmahaWarpath @WhiteHouse Expanded background checks?  People with diagnosed mental illness shouldn't be good candidates for gun ownership.
@HawkDiesel1906 @OmahaWarpath @WhiteHouse The words "well regulated" are at the top of the 2nd amendment. This isn't unconstitutional.
@ChadwikoRCC @HawkDiesel1906 @WhiteHouse sorry sir your still wrong.  He is once again abusing his supposed power. Thank god he will out.
@OmahaWarpath @HawkDiesel1906 @WhiteHouse Well, Obama will never be "voted out". He will have served the maximum time in office allowed.
@ChadwikoRCC @HawkDiesel1906 @WhiteHouse got me there. To bad as well. Maybe we will get a repeat and turn completely 3rd world.

@WhiteHouse More killed by cars so need background checks on cars. also knifes and Mental health on all Democrats as they commet most crimes
@WhiteHouse @donnabrazile how come FBI numbers disagree ? Why add suicides in your figure ?
@Legion3rei @WhiteHouse @donnabrazile SERIOUSLY? You don't think people killing themselves with guns isn't gun violence?
@thegratefulgran @WhiteHouse @donnabrazile if committed to suicide will find a way no matter. That accounts for 2/3 of gun violence
@TNJed3 @Legion3rei @WhiteHouse @donnabrazile 2 separate issues. Nephew killed himself w/shotgun. Trust me, it was VIOLENT.
@WhiteHouse @donnabrazile Fact: most murders are committed by legal gun owners.

@WhiteHouse @ChrisVanHollen 
Fact: in the past decade crime went down.
@WhiteHouse @PublicHealth FACT : govt cannot protect everyone
@WhiteHouse You folks want to take on gun control? Go for it...just be honest so we can have an honest national debate. This is why DC sucks
@WhiteHouse thx for pushing agenda fed. As a #trauma #surgeon couldn't agree more: we need to #StopGunViolence
@heenastat @WhiteHouse @surgeoninheels you'll never stop violence. Obama simply uses mass shootings to justify his lawless lust
@WhiteHouse Why don't you make it illegal to commit a crime with a gun? Mandatory 10-20-Life federal penitentiary without parole. #guncrime
@WhiteHouse this won't stop anything
@WhiteHouse That's 0.009% (.00009) of US population. If suicides are removed 11,000-12000 die from guns each year which is 0.003%. FACTS!
@WhiteHouse more than 1.3 million die in car crashes. #stopcarviolence
@WhiteHouse Depressed people committing suicide, gang members shooting each other, accidental shootings. Good riddance. -GOP
@WhiteHouse  That's not even one 10,000th of 1% of the U.S.  population. God forbid you put your fear mongering stats into perspective. #usa
@WhiteHouse ...happy to see no one else dies in this country...
@WhiteHouse 480,000 deaths per year from tobacco use in the US per CDC....what's your plan on that? Crickets? Hypocrite much?
@WhiteHouse: Unfortunate!
@WhiteHouse I'm sure there are some people on the far right side of the GOP who are perfectly OK with this fact.
@WhiteHouse no, not by guns, by psychos with guns. Guns don't shoot themselves DUH!
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse 88,000 per year die from alcohol each year per the CDC....what's the plan on that? "War on Alcohol"? Crickets? Hypocrite much.
@WhiteHouse If you want the guns, grab your testicles/ovaries and come try to take them. Until then STFU.
@WhiteHouse @amoslee
@whitehouse#!!!!!! #!
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse Go to Chicago and start there.
@WhiteHouse   
@WhiteHouse And how many of those are suicides? Apparently his Holiness Obama can prevent suicide with his angelic powers....
@WhiteHouse go for it Obama - just a curb on psychotics having guns will be great. I'd like them all gone - especially hidden --and holsters
@WhiteHouse FACT - 1.3 million die every year from vehicles. When are we going to have Vehicle Control and ban them?
@WhiteHouse how many more lives are taken in drunk driving calls? With knives? Domestic violence?
@WhiteHouse Most of these happen in Democratically controlled areas with strict gun laws. Lots of people die in cars too, are they next?
@WhiteHouse Please, refresh my memory....how many, of all races, genders, ages and religions are killed by automobiles?
@WhiteHouse Who made this is a real artist.If we had this many deaths against the phantom enemies you people generate, we would have no war.
@WhiteHouse /Yea ,you fucking assholes!!! Guns the you mother fuckers sale illegal in Mexico so they can sales back to in are Nation
@WhiteHouse /That's why I don't have no respect for your laws and regulations,if you break the law,anybody can break the law? I am the one..
@WhiteHouse so we should ban cars?
@jpsmith4 @WhiteHouse agreed. Guns obviously aren't a problem. Nobody should be doing anything to change the status quo.
@WhiteHouse 20,000 by SUICIDE
@WhiteHouse and what about the death toll from suicide and gun-related accidents? How do we avoid dangerous tools on the street? #swords?
@WhiteHouse That number is made up in the largest part by illegal guns,  go to Chicago and take away their guns.
@WhiteHouse Fact: Your gun laws would not have stopped the gun violence and deaths.
@WhiteHouse that's a shame, a damn shame
@WhiteHouse fact ----  the constitution is not negotiable on amendments "Shall not be infringed"
@WhiteHouse How many by criminals?
@WhiteHouse And every year, millions die in traffic accidents. Time to forbid, cars, buses, trains, planes ...
@WhiteHouse and the incumbent used to be leader of the free world. These days, he only resembles an idiot, in serarch of a legacy! Pathetic.
@WhiteHouse about the same number of ppl killed by drunk drivers. No action on that but it destroys just as badly. Prohibition forthcoming?
@WhiteHouse won't happen.
@WhiteHouse Yes throw those stats out and then we can quite deaths related to smoking, drinking and other things and see who wins. Morons
@WhiteHouse fact: more than a thousand times died in abortion
@WhiteHouse FACT: Appealing to fear to curtail rights and impose government control is tyrannical and evil.
@WhiteHouse November can't get here fast enough.
@WhiteHouse Each year, 90,000 lives are cut short by alchohol
@WhiteHouse Abortions kill how many ?
