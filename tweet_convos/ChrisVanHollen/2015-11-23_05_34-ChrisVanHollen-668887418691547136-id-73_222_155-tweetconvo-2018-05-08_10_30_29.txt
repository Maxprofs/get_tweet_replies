@RepThompson @IsraelNewsNow @realDonaldTrump The Loophole which needs to be closed up is Major Immigration Reform. No?
@RepThompson How about denying the right to vote because someone is suspected of committing a felony? @IsraelNewsNow
@RepThompson @ChrisVanHollen  And folks who shoot up schools, movies, and churches?
@RepThompson Can we also deny constitutional rights to people based on suspicion of other criminal activity without proof? @IsraelNewsNow
@RepThompson So far as I am aware, nobody on a terrorist watch list has ever been involved in a shooting with a legal gun @IsraelNewsNow
@RepThompson @Maggyw519 no time for such foolishness!  Too many  important #SeditiousActs #Hatred, #Obstruction and #FearMongering #Lies
@RepThompson @IsraelNewsNow @realDonaldTrump 91% of suspected Terrorist have a Driver License?? How did that happen????
@repthompson @nancypelosi 

If they are on a radical watch list then send them back!!  That will take care of your gun worries
If they were background checked and still able to purchase, isn't this a failure at the Federal level? Dylann Roof too. @RepThompson
@RepThompson @NancyPelosi  Intellectual  zombie !
@RepThompson @HouseDemocrats   Now there will be a terrorist run on guns !
@RepThompson The problem is that terrorist watch lists are often only a name.  Many different people can have the same name.  @IsraelNewsNow
@RepThompson @HouseJudDems "We the Ppl" common sense legislation on gun violence
@RepThompson @HouseDemocrats you do realize that by banning guns you only make the value of guns go up, which increases demand to have them
@RepThompson @PresSanders1 That's exactly what the second amendment requires them to do . "The security of the land being a necessity"
@RepThompson @riromtz time to shut down the NRA & all its idiot followers
@RepThompson @HouseDemocrats so Federal back ground checks are not effective?
@RepThompson yes, agree we must remove gun purchase loopholes
@RepThompson @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @realDonaldTrump Donald, what's your plan to ensure terrorists don't buy guns in America?
@RepThompson You let them in hypocrite
@RepThompson @NancyPelosi mainly domestic terrorists + perhaps some Am heads turned by ISIS
@RepThompson Congrats on writing a great house tweet! http://greathousetweets.measuredvoice.com/RepThompson/status/668784800862441472 … (Ranked 1st for Nov 23.)
@RepThompson @NancyPelosi World Aids Day DEC 1. Salif Keita of Mali did a song for Red Hot and Blue charity
@RepThompson what do they check for if not this?
@RepThompson @HouseDemocrats
@RepThompson Truly wish success on such legislation, but fat chance it'll happen. Like national, no exception, background checks.#guncontrol
@RepThompson Y'all funny with this low education bs. Where you at @BernieSanders
@RepThompson @HouseDemocrats @AustinLieuallen
@RepThompson @sethmoulton and how homicides have been committed using an assault rifle that was legally purchased you dummy
@RepThompson @sethmoulton not in the facist paradise of Massachusetts
@RepThompson @sethmoulton so I guess if the @NRA fights any legislation to close this loophole they support terrorists
@RepThompson The Republican Congress must act now or take responsibility for any horrendous  terrorist attacks.
@RepThompson @NancyPelosi Gee, ya think keeping outta the freakin" country might help, too?!? #LibTardsAreKillinTheUSA
@RepThompson when we have massacred citizens here congress has done 0 on gun control. WE are a well of arms for terrorists and others
@RepThompson @NancyPelosi These two were on your watch list & Russia warned you about them. It's not a gun issue.
@RepThompson @HouseDemocrats post there pictures in stores. But criminals have black market connection. Close that #legalcorruption loophole
#NoFlyListNoBuyList
@RepThompson @HouseDemocrats
@RepThompson @NancyPelosi Terrorist watch list? You folks couldn't catch a cold in the Artic let alone a terrorist.
@RepThompson @NancyPelosi  Oh? They passed your stupid background checks? Why?
@RepThompson @NancyPelosi ?? Sanctuary cities, open borders, ISIS refugees, empty prisons. Now disarm Americans? NUTS
@RepThompson YOU SHOULD START ENFORCING LAWS & SEND ILLEGALS HOME STOP P.C. CRAP. COLLEGE STUDENT PROTESTERS WANT HISTORY ERASED. IDIOTS
@RepThompson @RepSteveIsrael NO! Terrorists must be allowed to buy guns in the USA! It is second amend right!! @NRA
@RepThompson @RepCohen Without exception. Nor any state deviation. Needs to be hard and uniform.
@RepThompson @NancyPelosi   Yet we're still allowing everyone in. Isn't that the bigger issue?
@RepThompson @NancyPelosi why are they here in the first place? Because of the liberal scum
@RepThompson @NancyPelosi- The NRA would rather protect gun profits than allow laws to protect us from terrorists https://shar.es/1c23uD 
@RepThompson @cranevl Really? How about the 4th Amendment? Your suspicions are not due process.
@El_general_Meno @RepThompson - All for due process.... before a terrorist buys a gun.
@cranevl so apart from burning bill of rights for your ideology UR saying U have Zero clue how the list Works? typical when left talks #2A.
@cranevl you must support Trumps idea of a Muslim Database as well?
@El_general_Meno - Have no idea where you're coming from. No problem. Blessed be.
@RepThompson And yet you ignore dangers and a lack of wisdom in every other respect because not politically expedient for a Democrat. YK
@RepThompson @NancyPelosi And A Fool Believes The Black Market Has Little Too Do With Gun Sales & Trades. Source: GOD
@RepThompson @NancyPelosi #gopfail #boghtandpaidfor @KellyAyotte
Really, @marti431uew? How about the 4th Amendment? Your suspicions are not due process.
@El_general_Meno Due process should be open debates and voting in congress on what is good for US.  Not what is good for @NRA
@marti431uew @NRA that makes zero sense. I think ur saying burn the bill of rights for your ideology. The left does not live in reality.
@marti431uew @NRA I think you need to go back to civics class and understand what the 4th amendment actually means #2A
@RepThompson @RepCardenas جب انسان دلیل سے عاری ہوتا ہے تو یا گالی پہ 

اتر آتا ہے یا خودکش حملہ کر کے خود کو ختم 

کرتا.....
@RepThompson @NancyPelosi In one breath you say there are no terrorists coming into the country pay no attention to those Syrians. Then this
@RepThompson @NancyPelosi as corrupt as our political system is & with the "terror threats" I don't think it's safe to give up gun rights!
@RepThompson @NancyPelosi with all these terror threats shouldn't citizens Be given guns &  training to help protect ourselves & neighbors?
@RepThompson @NancyPelosi France has heavily regulated gun laws & yet who has guns over there right now? Yup, the terrorists. #wakeup
@RepThompson @NancyPelosi The NRA-controlled GOP is a US terrorist's best friend.
@RepThompson @NancyPelosi Due Process first for all those on their by mistake, use that "Good vetting system" you have.
Mike Thompsonさん

Congress must act to close loophole

Thank you very much.

@RepThompson @NancyPelosi
@RepThompson @NancyPelosi I know right, your "Illegal Alien" best buds deserve the same rights as terrorists to get guns! Damned loopholes!
