@realDonaldTrump has given us another #GoldmanSachs #SwampCabinet pick. #ForeclosureKing
You have a 100% voting record by NARAL.Thats all that's needed to know about you.
As a resident of southern Maryland, thanks for fighting against that nominee.
Excellent description of Spicer using past administrations intelligence problems as excuse to do NOTHING
@SenateDems the swamp is filled now to the brim!
Thank you, Senator!
And glad to hear Puzder is  probably withdrawing.
thank you for representing the values of Marylanders
thank you!!!
.... Sen Van Hollen... Do all you can to delay vote on Pruitt....at least until you can review his emails.
Dear @ChrisVanHollen , question - are you implying that you , a Maryland politican , are somehow different ?
have you made a statement on Pruitt? If not, I urge you to vote no. #savetheEPA
GLAD ur vote didn't count.
Great!  Now, demand an investigation of Flynn and the Trump Admin's Russian ties.  It is a mature of national security!
Thank you! I know it's tough right now; your constituents are behind you!
@SenateDems Thank you. SO glad you are representing me and my family from the great state of Maryland!
Thank you Senator.  Please continue to stand up against nominees who want to destroy what has been achieved.
Thank you!!
You mean I don't have to angry-call your office to get u to do the sensible, decent thing? Good heavens,how frightfully dull
as a Maryland voter thank you so much! #resist
@SenateDems that's the way sir. Keep it up, we're behind you and aren't going anywhere
There's a "smoking gun" at the WH. Investigate! Be focused and lead.
Thanks, @ChrisVanHollen. Where do you stand on #Pruitt? Will you join @SenatorCardin to seek a delay? #resist #cleanwater

Of course you are,...ALL Dems vote No on ALL President Trump appointments. It's pathetic partyline politics!

Thank you for a "no" on #Mnuchin.
@SenateDems Your No votes are duly noted see you in 2018, 2020, 2022, 2024 etc
when "Trump" lies, one should lie big, and stick to it. They keep up their lies, even at the risk of looking ridiculous.
This constituent thanks you for continuing to fight the good fight.

@SenateDems Then vote & stop delaying and obstructing. #obstructionistdemocrats Do your job. Work 4 us. Our tax $. #DTS
They are doing their job. They are representing their constituents who want to obstruct.
Doing their job doesn't mean walking in lockstep with a buffoon and President Bannon.
