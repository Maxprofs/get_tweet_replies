Weeeeeeezooooo.... let's get it.. ur shyt is soooo ... Keep doing wat u been doing.. I appreciate ur work homie.. I've been listening to ur smacks for bout.... 13 yrs..: even when u. Was in jail. u came out n dropped that a milli. or was it 6 foot 7.. u always come thru. Thanks
Cheers to the Greatest Rapper Alive.  I am definitely ready to hear D6 Reloaded. I know u went in on it Wayne. I think its about time that u get on that Hollywood Walk of fame. Real Shit u are a Legend and so misunderstood. But I get u boo loud & clear. Love u Unconditionally 
I thought I was ready, but damn it, #D6 is so fucking good I don't think I'm ready to stop playing it to listen to more  I could get another easy 500 listens and still not be ready to put it down lol
I hear u bro. But I can never get enough of Wayne. Even when I call myself listening to another artist on Pandora I swear this cat still pops up as a feature on at least every other song & all I ever do is smile. I am a real Wayniac. His music feeds my soul. Embrace it Chris 
Man, I can't even lie. I start smiling the second D6 starts. I stop smiling 54 minutes later. Bring it back to Fly Away, & spend the next hour doing the same exact thing. He's one of the few that always have me remembering random ass bars. It's great.
I get u !!! I can just about spit anything that has ever came from @LilTunechi . I study him. His swag & flow. I learned "Dreams and Nightmares " in one day lol one of my favorites from him. So i totally get u. Its good chatting with u fellow Wayniac  Keep supporting The God 
Always support the God, G.O.A.T.
Always & 4 ever !!! No other way 
As a matter fact Im bumping D6 now @LilTunechi
Please fixture wizkid please king 
Can't wait wayne
Nice Tune! Kan’t wait to hear it. Sikkshit!!
