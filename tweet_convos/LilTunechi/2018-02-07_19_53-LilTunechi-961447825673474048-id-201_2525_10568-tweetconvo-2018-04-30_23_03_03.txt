How is future headlining over lil wayne or rick ross?
That part right there  The hell with this . I think @LilTunechi should headline at Coachella . I swear some ppl just don't get my boy & never will. I may not be  A list Celebrity but I won't stop until Wayne gets the recognition that he deserves!!!
Back in Wayne’s prime he’d make everybody here look like kindergarteners, title wise and music wise.
Wayne will always in his prime he was in his prime before he was born
Dude brink that show out west,  got a 12000 seater avilable 4 ya

Hello lil wayne
I don't kno how the hell u ain't headlining.. and u bet not he on stage before the goofy white boy post Malone
Lil Wayne and Drake suck no talent at all. #whatsuphaters
