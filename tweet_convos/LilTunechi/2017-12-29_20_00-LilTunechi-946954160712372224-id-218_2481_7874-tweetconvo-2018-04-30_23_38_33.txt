Money is not the root of all evil. 

In popular culture, a great amount of focus is placed on the Illuminati’s belief that money is not evil. Some view our encouragement of work and wealth as a promotion of selfishness – overlooking the true meaning of the Pyramid

@LilWayneHQ @Drake the GOAT
Thanks for retweeting
100’s of people said that after watching this music video, they have engaged with a homeless person or got them a bite to eat.
I can’t eradicate homelessness but if through this we encourage a little humanity, that’s something
