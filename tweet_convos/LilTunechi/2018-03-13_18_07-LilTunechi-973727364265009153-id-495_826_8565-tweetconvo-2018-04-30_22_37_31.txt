I feel pity for Dwayne Michael Carter cuz might have enemies than he think he does ,
For crying out loud he said he wasn't feeling well and apologized for that matter , then you think it would have been better for him to come so you can witness the dying of a legend?

@LilTunechi since everyone is in their feels throwing requests. Can I make a request that you come to Lincoln, Nebraska and put on a show soon. If you could hook a guy up with some free backstage meet n greet to meet you that'd be dope mang! Please N thanks mang!
