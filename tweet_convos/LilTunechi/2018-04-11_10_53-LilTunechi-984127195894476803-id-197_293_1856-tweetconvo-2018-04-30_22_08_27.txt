Hello Weezy
Hey
Bumbu for Life
Ps I've had it a few mixed drinks and straight shots. I have a massive tolerance so it takes me half the damn bottle, and other mixed drinks to even get buzz. While back I drank 3/4 bottle of crown/beer and had a buzz for 15 mins. I don't very often but oh well.

yesssssss “  IM THE BEST RAPPER ALIVE”
