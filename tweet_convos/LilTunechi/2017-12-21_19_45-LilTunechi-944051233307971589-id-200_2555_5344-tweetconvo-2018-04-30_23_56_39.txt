When you and @TechN9ne gonna fill up Arrowhead stadium for a concert in Kansas City...
Dude...... Mr. Carter. Plz go back to how you used to do it from 05’ to 09’. This auto tune voice stuff is bad man. Give the people what they want. Old wayne. Or atleast give the old wayne heads some old wayne. Or release some stuff u recorded back then for us.
Autotune Wayne is still Old Wayne. How Old you want Wayne to go? Want him in braids saying bling bling?
There was bling bling Weezy, then Carter Weezy, then mixtape god mode Weezy, then autotune Weezy, then mumbled garbage Weezy.

Gimme that carter/mixtape Weezy.
Lmao

All I ask is type of songs like "I'm single" to be on D6.
Man I love those beats and they get to me every time I'm ......
Nice

Now this is great music. Bank Account, and I haven't listened in yet.
John Hairston at Whitney- Hancock, they are doing the same thing I'm about to do.
2 bank brands, 5 states. They are about $50 Billion in Assets. Not bad.
Exception, we will be on at least 4 continents as RBA & Friendly. Pretty neat right!
I know your a UOFH Cougar. I will go there really quickly. Centering in Addis Ababa, From Kenya to Egypt can become a $4.7 Trillion in GDP Region from now to 2042.
Today All of Africa is at $3-4 Trillion. That's HUGE UPSIDE GROWTH.
If you deposit $1 Billion dollars, it becomes a deposit liability.
Which then triggers, thru fractional reserving, an "asset creating" situation, where up to WONT EVER HAPPEN 90% of deposits can be LENDED (LTD Ratio- Required Reserve Ratio), the credit facilities income producing assets and due. My LTD ratio is proprietary.That's Loan-to-Deposit

Hmm I’d love to hear you explain why his music isn’t good.
Lol you didn’t give 1 legit reason. Pure hating. Give me 1 reason he’s a bad rapper
The fact you say “rap isn’t music” just shows how dumb you are. Go to iTunes and click on genres, why is rap one of them? And once again,  I’d like to ask you, give me one reason he’s a bad rapper. You don’t use any facts, just your hating opinions, which I must admit is funny af
Nice way to bring in the holidays
Yes he's back bout time son the streets been waiting
