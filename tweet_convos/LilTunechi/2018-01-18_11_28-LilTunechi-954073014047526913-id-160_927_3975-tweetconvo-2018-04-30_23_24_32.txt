@Retro_CodChamp @iAM_DTuck he's too emotional . Tf he making this song for anyway?
He annoying tbh he be usin Weezy name for clout

Mannie coo wit him he just don’t like when he run his mouth n do his Lil rants n juvie don’t fw him at all 
nigga need to stop. Just be cool with Wayne if you want. But I hope he realize it'll never be like hot boy days. Like he prolly wanna be in his circle, them days gone. Just get yo features and ask him to tweet it out. Maybe hit some club events with him from time to time
