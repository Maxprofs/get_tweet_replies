He dropped dedication 6 + reloaded
Like 25/35 tracks. Did you even listen
You and @LILUZIVERT need to collab
Real
Never pls
Lol why?
Cause i think (personal opinion, dont be offended.) That wayne is on a whole different lvl than uzi is.
Or uzi must come with some lyrical metaphore shit and suprise me, but dont think that is gonna happend
I get what you mean but I see Uzi as a younger version of Wayne in both their looks and their music.
Looking good @LilTunechi

Wats the point u never gon hit back

Damn wayne u uglier than a muhfucka bruh
