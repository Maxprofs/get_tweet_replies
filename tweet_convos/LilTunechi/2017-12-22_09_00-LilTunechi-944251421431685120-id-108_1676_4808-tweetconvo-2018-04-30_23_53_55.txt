bruv mixtape wayne way more important than ufos and aliens from elon musk. wayne snapped on bank account 
I havenâ€™t got to check that out yet
You shouldâ€™ve got thugger    His music is actually good
Nice one honey
Sup bro let me get a track I got some. Hot shit spitten
Man this mixtape here is my last string w/ you dogg. If this album flops i'm officially done being a Wayne fan. I've enjoyed you over all the years but you're music isn't the same anymore... You're trying to make your music like the current music genre is. And that's mumble rap
Bitch I have freedom of speech. I'm willing to say whatever I want bitch, and IT'S my OPINION. And I don't give 2 shits about what you talking about... You must be a current wayne fan never heard any of his classic stuff only his current. If you're a oldschool fan u would know
Na nigga I was raised on Wayne. I'm 26 born in 91. Either brocking or you not. wtf u here for. You a fan or a hater..? Sound like a lil of both. I know you 1 disrespectful basterd, mass ass nigga.. Yo internet hands something serious. Catfishing on Twitter. nigga please. 
You still hating or you feeling #D6..? I already know the answer.
