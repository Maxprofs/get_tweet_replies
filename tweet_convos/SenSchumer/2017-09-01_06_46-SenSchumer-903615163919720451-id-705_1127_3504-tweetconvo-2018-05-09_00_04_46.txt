The self-enriching Republicans stole this election, cheated and do everything in their power to undermine our elections. He was NOT elected
So you admit it, that's the first step, congratulations!

Because you don't have one. That's why.
Maybe it sucks?

Theres none. Nevee was. Nevee will be. All they had was ANTI-OBAMACARE PROPOSAL OF HATE ANYTHING OBAMA. Next casualty TAX BILL FOR THE RICH
Obama wins as a Failed President. Period. Always bowing behind red lines.
!
You need to get out of our govt. you are a disrupter, a pot stirrer, and an unproductive railroader, and puts our system to a turtles crawl!
Because your party has been a variable treasure trove of ideas right?
Stop building a fan club on the rubble of the lives of Texans, @realdonaldtrump, and get back to what matters. #RebuildHouston #NoBanNoWall
My sentiments exactly
Ask the people who were saved in Houston, see how they feel after losing everything? How can you judge not even being there?
Better dealwtf is your platform? Illegals first Americans 2nd? Retire.
I think any plan that replaces the financial rape of the American middle class, perpetuated by Obama & Dem policies, is a plus.  Raw deal!
Better deal? You do not have one. Awan. Phillips. Wasserman.Liu.
If people thought your deal was better, HRC would be in the White House. Deal with it.
Not really ace. How you feeling about that Trump vote as each day goes by? Embarrassed yet? #Impeach
Not at all! Love my POTUS!@realDonaldTrump
The crotch grabber in chief will throw you under the bus. You only have yourself to blame.
Bc it sucks and you are not worth them wasting time over
They are seditionist nothibg more incapable of a comorehnsive plan for anything
You need to be in front of the mic every day slamming them like they did for the last 20 years. #shortenthemessage
What is your version of a #betterdeal plan? Where can everyone see it? Have we looked into the ten best private performing Forex Accounts?
@SenGillibrand @SenKamalaHarris @SenSanders & @SenWarren all support single payer health care and I'd like both my Senators to get on board
Socialism=communism=single payer=Venezuela = won't work
. No one wants to hear you Chuck Schumer. Go do something productive, like resign, you are worthless! #BigWind 
Give me break I thought everything was just fine for last 8 yrs now you try & steal POTUS ideas like we don't see through you #Hypocrites
I believe you. You haven't heard from them.
You & your party have had no policies to date.  "Politician speak", talk long, say nothing.  What I hear is echo of Pres Trump's plans 4 USA
I say time for Impeachment proceedings! Get him out he is incompetent! 
They must still be alternating between laughing and trying to determine if you were serious....
Exactly. Hot air buffoons.
Given that, I don't see much from you on the great job he is doing regarding Hurricane Harvey...cat got your tongue on deserved praise?
Yep, thats their better deal. Shit talk and hope it sells.
This #ABetterDeal plan needs to include massive lowering of college tuition costs too, ppl can't afford to get skills they will need. .
Democratic politicians have long for less expensive tuition and financial relief for students
It's not worth commenting on or they are still laughing.
The better deal is in place, you may have heard of it, it's called #MAGA I suggest you get with the program. STOP BEING THE PARTY OF NO!
#ABetterDeal is a terrible slogan
Try chanting it 
it does not sing
Need something catchier
@realDonaldTrump kicks ass at branding
#reality
Crying Screw-mer, our POTUS will get the job done, with or without you! Now we got crying Screw-mer and lying Hillary.
I would like the ACA to be fixed and be the Health Care of America.
Show me the plan!
We know who's side your on & won't forget when it's time to vote in NY.
Hope Your plan is not like Obamacare was!
Well, it's not a better deal. You're just trying to copy MAGA-good luck with that!
Why.....you all get nothing done.
he's thinking of the millions affected by hurricane he cares for the people not only politics
Reframe #ABetterDeal to #CreateFairOpportunities for all. Please Read/SignUp/Share #MakeAmericaTruthfulAgain.
McConnell will not respond before he gets directions from Bannon and Breibart. He knows he's shunned if speaking before permission
DTrump does not understand upright ;senateMajLdr condones

I say you're an Obstructionist
President Trump must want McConnell to pay him more in return for Mitch pounding the shit out of Trump's Ass on a daily basis!
If you have such a great deal why wasn't it implemented in the last 8 years? It just more of the same failing ideas.
No one likes you
Schumer you are a corrupt member of "the tribe".  You are pure evil and will get what you deserve.
Keep the Sophistry going.If you had a plan noone could hear it over your obstruction.hatred.and crying.
I say kill both the Democratic and Republican fascist Parties. We need representative Parties.
You have not answered anyone's questions either so deal with it.
Stop worrying about your plan and start worrying about victims of HARVEY. Your party is fisgusting
They cannot concentrate on  "a better deal plan," they are too busy trying to cover their tracks.
Shut up chuckie
They may not be interested, because it wasn't their idea.  They only care about the 1%, not the rest of us.
Texas much more important than your plan right now
He's busy with Houston and Nort Korea
Depends.  Did you put lots of pretty pictures - and not too many words?
I say he has better priorities than wasting time reading your bullshit plan.
Release the fake plan Chuck. Or is it still tax the rich. Tax them at 100% won't pay for all your socialist programs. You created this mess
I say it is one of the weakest messages by the Dems ever, and I am a progressive Dem. Figure it out soon or we'll lose everything again.
Is anything being done to protect us from hacking in next elections?? I see no action and we wasted a year. Is there a plan to prevent??
That is because your better deal plan is more of the same crap Obama fed us. It didn't work. #tryagain
I am a life long democrat gone Berniecrat this is muddled nonsense a real no energy flop no real ideas for the working class the poor
I say your better deal still sucks.
I suppose they're extending the same courtesy u gave them for MAGA?  He went on w/out u since apparently u lack experience on job creation
I say you should get the hell out of office

THE REPUBLICANT'S CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO MOVE THE COUNTRY FORWARD - THEY ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF ROBBING OUR TAX DOLLARS FOR THEIR FRIENDS.
The wall is coming Mexico will pay for it we have a master deal maker people give a chance what have you done for Texas you just bash potus.

Like working with DEMS chucky
I wouldn't be the first to say it but  no reply is an answer.
Please start shaming your Republican colleagues into doing their duty re this President.They are complicit with this corrupt administration.
That is because it is not a better deal - tired!
It deserves no response
You think you're heroically obstructing @realDonaldTrump but Americans see you obstructing the will and agenda of the People. #PassOurDeal

Get back to the bar libtard
I say we need a far better name for this plan. And more details!! We need to connect with people, we are failing to do so!
I say go to Texas and help those poor people out ! Get off your thrown.
I say ur sorry ass is on vacation & dont come back til next week
You could literally come up with the greatest plan in the history of the world and they still wouldn't support it. They're just that selfish
@realDonaldTrump could literally cure cancer, give everyone a million dollars and Lamborghini & you would still not support him.

Deal or no deal
Offer him attention or money. He'll talk to you then - r

They're busy destroying democracy at the moment.
Change the name to "Trump made America great again plan" and you'll get his support b4 he ever lays eyes on it. 
Rename it later.
Yurwelcome
Better slogan please!!!!
I am shocked (feigns outrage).
I say sounds like the same ol s**t your party has been pushing for 50 yrs. as our nations withers.
@mrschumer what say you ?
#nothing!
I say you are all idiots. Do you think up these things all on your own or does Pelosi script them for you?
Y'all had 8 years for your better deal, We voted Trump to handle this
No surprise. They have no plans.
U had a plan for 8 years and it sucked. Now u have a better deal?!?  U still think Obamacare was good.
Tired out of date plan that dates back to Hillary's campaign. Do u remember how far it got her? Dems have no creativity.
They are hiding senator
Trump's most memorable accomplishment will be when he quits! #Resign
Because they don't care
@realDonaldTrump disrespectful like that-he's not human just
Bahahaha.  You make me laugh.   Now you want to do something.  Ugh!
Thats because its not a better deal Chuckles.
Haven't heard back from the Dems either on fixing healthcare
Bill on Medicare for all is coming this month. Also many other bills open to improve.
That's because you plagiarized the president's plan.  Democrats are a joke
Change that NAME! Please!
I say Congress should submit to random drug testing. It would seem that the opioid epidemic has infiltrated Capitol Hill. With a vengeance.
Its you thats causing so much trouble
#Abetterdeal isn't happening! Say something real! Dems are blowing it again! New leadership! Draft #GavinNewsom
I'm still looking into Gavin. He was our mayor. Might be the answer we all need.
Lyin' Cryin' Chuck is back on the Joke of a Deal. Why don't you get off your ass & actually do something in the Senate?
Stuff it chuck
Chuck!!!! we need for you to discuss Donald Trump's misappropriation of taxpayer money during his Missouri attack on a sitting dem senator.
What else is new? It's not MN yet & still a Friday. No cliffhanger yet?  OMG?
@WrightTownsend @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr I say...make it work, and do your best for the people.  (CC: Republicans)
McConnell will never compromise.
I want to read the whole plan. I don't trust a damn thing from Democrats, being one of your smarter Americans
Trump is the worst President ever and their secret meetings are a disgrace.
Crooked Schumer -- American Fraud
Maybe b/c our President already has a better deal..Democrats r done Chuck!
Awan. The name that makes you squirm.
You are anchored to Obama care. That says enough about you.
You democrats better get your shit together because we can't deal with Trump much longer!!!
Not interested in more "Raw Deal" we had under Obama and you.  This is the same old redistribution of wealth plan you had before. @POTUS
We say no way chucky can come up with a plan forget a better plan
It's Amazing how fast Russian bots start hitting you with negative sound bites.  They are getting easier to spot
Wait a minute - are you saying they actually have a plan that's more than 1 page??  that's funny!!
I say YOU just be prepared to VOTE with Republicans for AMERICA!  @WashTimes @FoxBusiness @FoxNews Time to bridge the divide! #Bipartisan 
I'm sorry but it is a really stupid slogan.
Yeah.... #ABetterDeal keeps the poor down, kills the middle class, but lines your pocket. Step aside Chuck....
FU
You da clown putz!
Dims only take money from those who have to give to those who won't.  Of course they get rich in the process.  Aka Hairy Reid.Nancy Pelosi.
I say, RETIRE!  Stop trying to obstruct our government!  We won't forget!
Mulvaney is calling #SocialSecurityDisability "welfare".....That's OUR $$$ #HandsOffOurBenefits
Sadly, @realDonaldTrump  does not, and probably cannot, function other than as a partisan.
What have you done to deserve any cooperation from the current administration. They won, you should cooperate with them. Good grief!
They have a duty to lead and that leadership must start now, not when convenient.
Better deal? Crummy deal? Lousy deal? Lower taxes, regulations, EPA. Keep jobs here.
You guys are not doing this right.
The plan may be great but the slogan sucks. Sounds like a pizza commercial or like Donald Trump with his maga.
Pls work policies and inclusion of mid American and not just the coast. Talk to Sherrod Brown or Tim Ryan. They've got good ideas.
Forget anti-trump and racism. Work on those things without advertising those things. We've got to get control over ethics and policy
Work with Gov Kasich and Gov Hickenlooper and Company on Health Care. Don't be like reps and not have a plan when we get control again
I say that they must be looking at  it instead of just writing it off as you do
suck it Senator anything you democrats come up with will be another screw Americans package.
Because McConnell and Trump are besties anymore... It's war!
Thanks @SenSchumer for maintaining @TheDemocrats position as the responsible governing party in America.
Chuck it should be "economic and prosperity " period!
That reminds me.  Time to order a pizza.
That's because we're not socialists and we don't support it.  Down with Communist agenda--Better Deal for those who want to own the people.
Replace “A Better Deal” with "We guarantee Democracy" ?
Because you're better deal is the same OLD deal. Why don't you support the president's agenda and make America great again
@POTUS @vp #DrainTheSwamp which sadly means all of congress ALL @GOP & @DNC #DrainTheSwamp #DrainTheSwamp #DrainTheSwamp #DrainTheSwamp
What is it? I'm a Dem & I follow news pretty closely but I've never even heard of it.
I say 25th amendment
And you are surprised?  Old turtles never get soft shells for even hard sells. And Trumpy answers only to Trumpy.
Mr Schumer. Why would you. It's their plan.
Probably because it ain't a better deal if it came from you, Schumer.
Gosh I thought @realDonaldTrump wanted to work with you?! #yeahright #governmentishard #noworkalltrumpertantrums
Probably the 'ABetterDeal' was not much of a better deal. I would say they can resist and obstruct like you and @NancyPelosi eh?
At least we know who they are, wasserman, lynch, oh my, a long long list.
4.4% unemployment,  & 176,000 new jobs. 700,000 when we stop DACA,yeah!
he's busy
Then tell us the plan
