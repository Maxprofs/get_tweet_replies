Hereâ€™s the GOP #TaxReform plan. Their cover page could be the nicest part:
In #TaxReform, @POTUS asks Rs, Ds & Is to come together for a pro-America tax code. One problem. Their plan is pro-the top 1% of-Americans
Another way to screw the poor and middle class

Oh Chuckie, you sure lie a lot!
I think all you're bitching is just bringing out the opportunist in you.arent you the 1 percent, after all the millions you made, "servant"
The 12% and 25% brackets need to be brought down to 10% and 20% like trumps original plan he ran on. Otherwise it wont help anyone.
