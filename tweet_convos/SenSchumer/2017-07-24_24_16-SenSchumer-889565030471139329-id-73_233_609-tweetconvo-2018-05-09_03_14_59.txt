Trump is in bed with the big banks! Him and his cronies are advocates for everything big money, and advocate nothing for working people!
We don't need the government to tell us about a bad bank.
Republicans have made it clear they don't want to help people, they only care about big businesses and wealthy CEOs!
How many Wall Street Crooks did the Democrats and Obama prosecute? I'll wait
Banks are asking is it bad that a sitting senator like Bernie Sanders and spouse under investigation for bank fraud
I seen on TV ,that Chris Christie sitting next to Trump.See how they are he lost his job so he did not care what he did to people (BEACH)
Rich coming from you
What's so bad about helping voter's know when a bunch of corrup politicians are peeing down their backs and telling them it's raining?
Here's your bad actor Slime ball...
Chuck, we need a leader to protect the 2018 vote; someone who can approach Silicon Valley for help.  We need to bypass Trump.
What about the helicopters and small seaplanes over Northeast Queens and low altitudes???? #NOTJUSTYOURGOLDCOAST
You're a bad actor too, Chucky!
What's so bad about consumers helping themselves. Seems to me Bummer fined instutions to give to fave charities. How great is that!
Who got their  $2500 that Schumer and democrats promised? I had to pay about $5000 more how did I miss out? Who's paying? Not the rich! Me!
I'm a liberal! Stop not talking about hard issues! Trump Russia! And how they are stealing America!!!
right you are - all those hard issues - that have zero proof!
Hire a marketing firm. If you did fire them
SCHUMER THE MAN WHO HAS MADE A LIVING OFF BANKS AND SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS AND WALL STREET
How about a public bank?
Probably bc you had the chance and you you blew it #supportPOTUS
But it was ok for HRC to give very high priced speeches to banks and Wall Street, which, by the way, she would not disclose.
What's so bad abt letting ppl know a bad Senator, leader, a bad party, agenda, strategy?
What's wrong with letting the public know about crooks or the old democrat party.
Thank you for getting on the President Trump bandwagon senator Chuck Schumer
Schumer you're a fraud
Nothing, except the people bringing it to our attention are just as bad or worse
Funny how government/bureaucrats CREATE A PROBLEM, then swoops in PRETENDING TO FIX THAT SAME PROBLEM.
You forgot screwing working Americans thanks chuckles
Still mad at you for your comments on HRC
The Trumpers don't want to help consumers get a fair deal
Trump is destroying our country and the GOP are #complicit...get Trump and his criminal family out NOW
You do not care about the middle class.
Why not do the same for the politicians that are "bad actors" - like Chuck Schumer, Elizabeth warren ect...?

More lawsuits, higher insurance, higher rates for interest and services.  The customer will pay for any cost to operate even if not guilty
That's what the free market is for. Why would I trust big fed gov to tell me what bank to choose. U hold special interest in this Chuck?
Because your party helped them to strip the American people at our expense. I am sure you made plenty of bucks along with Ried& Company. Yuk
Hey Chawls,what changed your minds? I mean, russia is all we really care about. We want welfare,not a stupid job. Our pres,BO,would not do..
This to us.
Thank you. Perhaps I will write you concerning anti-consumer actions Bank of America does now,that at least are against spirit consumer laws
Chucky don't you have better things to do than tweet. Spend your time working on health care. You haven't done anything for such a long time
What about letting us know if a senator is bad actor??
Obama bailed out automakers, banks and insurance companies with your help. Shut up and go away.
Schumer, maybe you should think about retiring… you are not helping the people.
STOP YOUR OBSTRUCTION Mr.Schumer!!

It's time you and dims help as @realDonaldTrump and reps #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!

Great idea, terrible execution. The CFPB is a joke. They do nothing more than costs consumers money as they extort money from banks. defund.

well coming from a Corporate Dem that lies.. what does it matter? It's not like you will ever tell the truth anyway.
muted, you're pandering.
