Once again, shows that #Republicans don't give a damn about the #People!  
They will have access 2 emails too! Where we spend our time on web & yet same guys who think Trump shouldn't show his tax returns!
As an old white guy, I think these old white guys are a disgrace to our species!
Look at the good ol boys grin as they line their pockets and say to hell with constituents.
~ It's time for Anonymous to visit Congress' internet browsers & return the favor! ;) @mic
Yes Indeed!
Yet another sign the US is in a state of collapse. Depressing that our country & it's values are being systematically destroyed by GOP
@SenSchumer Sadly they all look proud of what they have done.
@LarrySc24132120 What did each of these republicans get for their votes?
Anyone know where to get list for who voted for it...
@SenSchumer How is that more nefarious than big gov. spying on us & using that info for attacks by the IRS, & NSA.
Agree but when obama did it this same group was silent Now the world just ended again
@SenSchumer Providers do it now!
He ain't no Dr! That title implies intelligence. More like Evil Doofus has taken over our world.

@SenSchumer one thing is clear: your are NOT for America and you're proving it more and more every day.
@SenSchumer aint this some shyte.
@SenSchumer you should have stopped this. 120 days since the election you've been saying Russia where's the proof?
You guys lie... They just put it back under one jurisdiction instead of two, where people's information was less safe.

@SenSchumer really shumer wasnt law.passed under obama or did u forget - stop your misleading
And you vote to kill babies, let our troops be stripped of resources, Benghazi, running guns that killed high school kids.
@StillNasty2017 But doesn't that impact the GOZo too? I just don't understand willful maliciousness.
So did Democrats... wake up!
NONE of you have ever used GOOGLE and FACEBOOK???? ALL of your BROWSING ITEMS appear on your FACEBOOK right column, right?

@crwaxlax @KenCalvert WHY?
Making america great? perhaps vulnerable. And why? grrrrr....
Are all Republicans this stupid???! How dare they!
And we can't wait to buy theirs.
Every vote to the highest bidder.  Surprised?
This makes me SICK to know they've sold out consumers info for profit. Wonder how #MAGA will feel now that #privacy is dead. #Sad @GOP
I'd like to know the names of the 15 GOP members that voted w/ Dems to keep our privacy safe...the others are looking out for big biz

@SenSchumer @mic @HurdOnTheHill  how does this benefit your average, everyday American?
shame on them selling our privacy, how do they have the right to do that?
@SenSchumer Sad we have to wait till 2018 to vote them out.  We should begin with selling their information online!
@SenSchumer Getting tired of the good ole boys! Clueless, no words for what they are doing. Is that private school & privilege teaches
All of our rights being taken away. We're trying to prevent our info being stolen. D is making it easier for that 2 happen.
WHAT THE HELL??? Americans must demand their privacy rights back, this is insane.  More signs the GOP hates Americans.
@SenSchumer i hope theirs is the first that gets sold
@SenSchumer aren't these the people so "concerned" about surveillance right now?
@SenSchumer  they would sell their own mother if they could make a dollar
@SenSchumer Thanks, @RepLoBiondo Figured you'd return 2 lock-step w/ rethuglicans after AHCA debacle. Disgraceful
@SenSchumer does that include theirs
So, think they will be re-elected.  We will not forget

@SenSchumer Profit. Always. Anything to make more money. Regardless of consequences.
@SenSchumer making America great, how do these idiots get elected
@SenSchumer terrible. They will lose their job in 2018
@SenSchumer That's been happening! The adds are always of places where you search!
@SenSchumer because how to deal with a sociopathic president is of great concern to those who want to oppress others.
get ready to find a whole lot of porn data
Every last one of them money grubbing traitors. They all need to be voted out - they don't deserve to work for the people.
I don't believe this! Twisting the truth!
As always these idiots ignore the will of the American people. They preach freedom, yet sell that off to the highest bidder.
And laughing up a storm about it giving big business another way to take your money
and they all are smiling and so proud of themselves for screwing us!
@SenSchumer Win for big corps. Campaign donations to these turds?
