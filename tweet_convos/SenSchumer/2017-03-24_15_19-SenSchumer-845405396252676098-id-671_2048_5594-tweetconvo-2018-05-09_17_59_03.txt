more like the alt right
well the Libs wanted to keep it.... so now they can watch this failure completely get crushed under its own weight
the failure of keeping Americans healthy and not dead? Works for me.
Premiums are skyrocketing. It'll only keep you alive if you can afford it.
THEY WOULD OF CONTINUE UNDER TRUMP CARE 25 PERCENT UNTIL 2020. SO WHO WOULD OF REALLYLOST
they're up 125% already in some states.....
so the new teump plane was no better. 30%penalty for 12 months.  do the math
competition leads to lower costs. Enjoy the shitty coverage you're forced to buy though.
this is HUGE oportunity for Dems to show who is the mature adult in the house
The "My way or I won't play" stance is a YUGE sign of maturity. Guaranteed to win the hearts and minds of all.
The bill failed cus the repubs aren't going to put crap out there like you and your party did. The should disagree until it's right
if they cared about not passing a bad bill, they wouldn't have presented it in the first place. The protests worked!
Unlike libs who voted for that debacle they never read, repubs have a mind of their own.If some like it, they did their job
NO they DO NOT have a mind of their own...if you gave them a choice, they'd vote for an inexperienced, unstable TV nut.
You sound like CNN twisting stuff  around
you misspelled 'stating the facts'. 
Actually you are half right, Ryan & co (RINOs) are incompetent. Bill was very bad & deserved to be defeated.
@SenSchumer don't forget you can't govern from the hard left
The hard right rejected his bill bc he put too nice of items in there. Just bc u say something doesn't make it true. SHAME!
@SenSchumer Schumer, incompetence is measured by the lack of constructive things done by democrats! You delay, obstruct, act violently!
Everybody listen to Moe the bartender I hear Homer is looking for him.
Trump will allow Obamacare to collapse. Democrats own this. YOu will pay dearly for it come next election.
Why not?  You oppose from the hard left.
POSMN was worst failure ever

You remind me so much of ELECTION NIGHT - remember? That was a glorious win for America - have you forgotten? 
fake news
Of course governing from the hard left is perfectly fine with you.
You can't govern from the hard left either. Incompetence was the Dems thinking Obamacare will work as is.
.@CNN @valstulman  You also cannot govern from the hard left. Just to be clear. Moderation= compromise= successful leadership
lmao
@SenSchumer Do nothing and just let Obamacare fail.
@SenSchumer Thats not true sir. Your pushing a hard left globalist agenda for your own personal gain so it just appears farther to you.
@SenSchumer ypu vcant govern from the hard left as well Chuckie.
Schu OPOSED ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING FOR POLITICAL REASONS. 

NEVER WORK TOGETHER IN BENEFIT OF PEOPLE.

We r guilty for letting them.
So we'd rather have somone like you, Chuckie boy, who knows NOTHING about governing?? YOU ARE A JOKE! Get over it. Hillary lost!
Schumer is one of the reasons America is divided report on that. CNN
@reesworld1 
Or govern from hard left!
BERNIE-crats?
     (?)
@SenSchumer #fakenews at it's finest.
@SenSchumer - Democrats need to come up with a plan to improve Obamacare!
because that hack is such a centrist? #BoycottCNN
@SenSchumer hey everyone chuck is on the fake News Channel again! Lol

Thankful @POTUS listened to the American people and walked away from #AHCA. One could wish @BarackObama did the same with #ACA.
Presidential incompetence?  #Trumpcare
There you go @realDonaldTrump. What are you waiting for?
so you can only govern from the hard left
Stop it Chuck, you see it all the time. The difference is that the public can't see it because the media protects you.
@SenSchumer GOD's will & guidance, now wait till obamacare fail & collapse.God bless & guide/ protect Pres Trump from evil doers.
shumer is an embarrassment.
@senschumer umm hey chuck remember when u passed obamacare late at night ramming it thru, and then ur website sucked & no1 could use it
@SenSchumer you are so jealous
@SenSchumer it failed b/c of people like u! Proud of Trump to not take the Dem BS. U got what u wanted too.
@SenSchumer. The democrats are failing the American people. All they do is obstruct and not help our president get things done
@SenSchumer 
If you are just going to Obstruct.. Please RESIGN.  THE PEOPLE need the government to work.  We pay you to work
But it helps when all parties do their job and quit wasting our time.
@SenSchumer Dems and the Clinton News Network..perfect together..you'll both go down in flames
@SenSchumer I think we should give Donald Trump another lower approval rating by 20% as to his huge healthcare failure.
@SenSchumer 2 idiots in 1 spot!
Missed opportunity
but you can from the hard left...hypocrisy at its best
schumer is a huge part of the incompetence.  The democrat party is nothing but incompetence
@SenSchumer as opposed to incompetence governing from hard left. Obamacare imploding while you shoot your mouth off. Talk, talk talk.
@SenSchumer Incompetence!!! You got to be joking
@SenSchumer really? What is obamacare?  That's genius right?  Do you actually believe the BS? Don't insult our intelligence
There is enough incompetence to to go around, Rs and Ds need to stop playing games and do what is right for all the American people
It failed because the children "democrats" don't want to admit Obama care sucks and helps illegals and welfare recipients
our country is so divided. It's only a matter of time before it completely falls apart.
is INCOMPETANT, along w fellow Dem Politicians..Pelosi, Warren, Lewis, Waters, Obstructionists who do no good for Americans
@SenSchumer Why don't you just put Schumer on the payroll, CNN
@SenSchumer look in the mirror
Schumer is a damn moronic agitator!
Really?  For your information, Senator, our moral fiber as a nation & our quality of life are being destroyed by Liberals!
what has Schumer done to help the healthcare bill
unlike him the congress read this bill and didn't like it. He & Pelosi never read ACA. "Just pass it read it later."
@wbrewyou Nor the Hard Left!
A power struggle is emerging.  Trump is in the middle of the left and his right . A loner in the Whitehouse.
the bill was not close to hard right, which is why it failed. At least challenge Schumer to get his ideology right Blitzer
@SenSchumer Schumer is incompetent. Obstructionist on every level. Gorsuch couldn't be more of a fair choice.
@SenSchumer Obama care is incompetent
@SenSchumer but you govern from the hard left.
@co_rapunzel4 @pannlewis44 #Veterans This is What Happens when you Elect a Glorified NRA TeaParty Telemarketer President
@SenSchumer look at yourself Chuckie and you will see lots of incompetence
schumer is a moron!
With dems obama said jump they said how high.
Well schumer unlike dems who blindly follow obama . Conservatives are free thinkers. It's harder to get them all to agree.
Dems will pay if Obamacare fails. Make medicsl plans better
Trump will make America gr8 again! !! Trump Trump Trump! !!
fake news .may God protect Trump. # Biafran voice! !!
@SenSchumer stop with the name calling
@SenSchumer If you don't work together it won't work
-- Corrupt, unethical and a bunch of liars at CNN. Simple, propaganda...you're fooling no one.
another cherry picked video....
.@CNN 

If @SenSchumer wants to see incompetence he merely needs to look in the mirror!
then why don't you snd Hillary work together with the Republicans for the good of America instead of bringing each other down?
Schumer You Dems now own this mess! Trump tried but you Dems blocked it! 2018 is right around the corner!
you are full of it chuck.
. CNN & Schumer lies & fake news.
FAKE NEWS
but the hard left is super duper?
@SenSchumer   You don't even have to pay or even use Obamacare. Yet u have no compassion for people paying high prices for it.
it will be better if they just leave it like it is now since they say it's the best in the world . If it's ok why to negotiate?
then why are you trying from the hard left
@SenSchumer u know the country is doomed when members of Congress won't vote for a SCOTUS candidate because he follows the constitution
I haven't seen one democratic bill or suggestion for our broken healthcare system that screwing seniors, middle class, vets
We must not forget that one of the reasons this didn't happen is because it wasn't cruel enough. If you aren't wealthy you are a target
so so funny.  The all time incompetent politician Schumer calling someone else the same.  Look in the mirror buddy.
@SenSchumer it failed because some stood up.  Unlike the ACA where 100% Dems knew it was garbage, yet voted for it anyway.
Bill wouldn't have even been written if Dems didn't screw up the first time! What was Schumer saying then? Obviously can't trust him.
@SenSchumer Chucky should be worried the REP's bill didn't pass. It would have prevented REPEAL of ACA. Now, it's a PRIMARY objective.
look at who's talking about incompetence! "Schumer" is synonymous with "incompetence".
@SenSchumer It's been nothing but a rolling train wreck which proved that Obama's promises about the law were nothing but lies.
@SenSchumer Obamacare had a terminal diagnosis from the very beginning, and it's going down like the Titanic, and it's all yours
@SenSchumer  Democrats own this one 100%.
Democrats no longer care about the people it's all about the party & $.  Chuckie, why aren't u on Obamacare?
yep, The GOP should have rammed it down our throats like the Dems did to us. Pass it b4 we know what's in it. Sneaky is always better
these stupid republicans just waste time and money over and over again.
@SenSchumer chucky got totally duped! Obamacare will collapse. Dems will get no repubs support. Ins goe back to free market. No subsidy
@SenSchumer this is awesome chucky! Trump wins you lose! Obamacare will go broke and take u with it! Hahaha!!!! Free market again. Haha
lol that bill was far from hard right...Paul Ryan is as close to a democrat as a republican can be.
@SenSchumer You have failed us in Upstate New York...can't wait to vote you out of office ! No more DUMOCRATS!!!
@SenSchumer keep up the good work!
@NancyPelosi Nan YOU OWN the MESS that is called Obamacare! #REMEMBERTHAT
Trump didn't fail, Obama's plan is failing.  "PASS IT AND THEN WE WILL FIND OUT WHAT IS IN IT" Pelosie said.  Why not report on that?
@SenSchumer I have. I'm looking at him in this video. You're attempt to filibuster Gorsuch is also irrelevant. You have no grounds.
@SenSchumer - try nancys sanctuary cities and Kate's death as a start on incompetence, now Maryland rape
Ocare will implode. Only catastrophic care bill is needed. Not everyone needs maj med. no discr preexist cond and keep exp Medicaid.
THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE IS READY TO WORK WITH DEMOCRATS, BUT WHAT ABOUT MR. RYAN? RYAN, THE " LONE SOLDIER WHO DID NOT NEED HELP!
"Work with GOP"?  For what?  Nothing could be better than ACA, right?  Or do you need to screw the rich even more?  No, I'm not rich.
not one pushback from @wolfblitzer on incompetence of @SenSchumer own party and governing from hard left
@SenSchumer let's see how Obamacare plays out in the 2018 midterm elections, shall we?
@SenSchumer senator like him is a ruin for all the world not only for us.
@SenSchumer Hey chuckie I wonder if your on Obamacare? I am and my premiums doubled and deductibles went up.
this has more to do with the fact is that there are too many Socialist Democrats and Republicans.
the reason this change on this is hard is because once you create an entitlement it's impossible to take away!
Dems live on the notion of pay for play, their motivation is not betterment of country for all, but only increasing their voting base!
they created this mess called Obama care, CNN knows it will implode, but as one large  political mass you are all seeking single payer!
how many tweets with comments from this old tired political hack, from this old tired hack news (?) network!
CNN it's hard to believe you have news in the middle of your name it should be CEN E for editorial, because you never just report news!
@SenSchumer It failed because you led your check collecting group to do nothing.  Get involved already.  DC is failing and starts w/ u.
Poor boo boo... Schumer is such a little B***H....
gonna love watching you eat your words...
CIA agents eating their words, now there's a novel thought. #OperationMockingbird
@SenSchumer Hypocrite
see he uses the word govern like we are his and their servants. We the people formed this country we govern it not few in DC
Nor from a place of ignorance of the process. Oh, and neither with schoolyard bullying as a tactic either.
This guy is incompetent not admitting that the true failed bill is Obamacare.
@SenSchumer is a bad ass and a career Politician, who just f*k d country.
your very bad example .
Schumer the dirty shitbag he is can go pound sand. His party is no better then the far right hacks
Sen prepare to see worse Trump will make you see worse and suffer more sleepless nights as long as you continue to fight him
Spoken by the man that rammed Obamacare down our throats by mandates and taxes saying insurance would be cheaper and better.
@SenSchumer Your coloring looks bad - retire and enjoy what's left.  
@SenSchumer You can't govern without your cabinet and the Dems. hell bent to destroy @POTUS. I will make sure you Dems lose your set
Hmmm..Secretary of Health (Tom Price), VP Pence, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and 33 Repub's said no.
@SenSchumer Thank you Schumer for stnding up for the people against thi treasonous illigitimate President
he saw plenty of incompetence, he helped pass the ACA.
and you cannot g
it fall because America did not want it and we use or voting power.. vote for the bill and loss your job in 2018
Chuck Schumer acts and behaves the way a President should, not that orange idiot who disgraces us daily.
only from the hard left eh?
@SenSchumer  look in the mirror. You will see incompetence. You are only concerned with your own agenda, not the good of the people
