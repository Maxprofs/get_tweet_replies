What we need Chuckie Boy is for the Democrats to stop your McCarthyism style of chasing a witch hunt. We have had enough of your BS.
I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good.- Adam Smith

The truth is that every day ObamaCare survives is another day America suffers. But don't wrorry Help is on the way.
Great job Chuck! You managed to find the 1 argument to get rid of net neutrality.If I wanted to see my family, I wouldn't be on the internet

Dear Chuck Schumer , question - do you even know what buffering is ?
Dear Chuck Schumer , question - do you see what you did making me ask that question the result of which was a damned bot liking the post ?
Maybe you ought to find out what something means before you comment on it.
The Net is not neutral. As I type this Twitter has attempted to download 608 ads on me, according to uBlock
We at the HP like this picture as do most Americans:
OMG. GET TO WORK
Tell the WHOLE story Chuck! Not just the selling point! Tell the public what else is in there instead of being SNEAKY about it!

must the giovernment totally ruin everything for money and greed
Yes because I'm sure everyone is going to love when it takes 15 mins for their baseball or concert ticket to load when it's already going on
The 3 bills passed today by the House are important steps forward to end the horrific crime of human trafficking:
please resign now you are biggest problem  American  have a great idoit
I say let's give up the internet and use things we used to. The library, maps, landline telephones, visit our neighbors and families

I would rather the government stay out of regulating the internet. #NetNeutrality
I'd rather the govt get the hell out of trying to controll every single aspect. Look at the va or the DMV to see what "govt control" does
Big gov running anything is bad. Look at the VA hospital, and what they have done to our healthcare system.
Don't be fooled America! Net Neutrality is not about your connection speed! 1. it would end Free Market. Research it! More Democrat lies!
I'd rather see Chuck Schumer selling used cars in Poughkeepsie.

#WePayEnoughTaxes
No. We don't need government involved. Let the private sector offer plans. Consumers will decide what they want. It's not one, or the other
Govt regs are a necessary evil. We cannot trust the industry enough to police itself. They are looking to make billions off our backs.
I trust the private sector over the government. Private sector has something to lose.
THE END of Net Neutrality?Save the Internet.Send comments to the FCC  #notmypresident  #TheResistance  #WeThePeople
@AjitPaiFCC I've had steady decrease over last 15 years>cable cos now charge extra for BroadBand i used to get FREE. Cable Cos = BB Suckers
Kind of like with #Healthcare #Obstruction #Confirmations
I'd rather see these symbols. My family & friends are hideous freaks
I would rather see LESS government in our lives.
I'd rather see less @SenSchumer in general...
Go away Chucky just go away with Hillary in the woods
You know, I was all for Net Neutrality before you said that. 

You have no idea how stupid& pointless many of the photos & videos I get are.
#wethepeople rather NEVER see a obstructionist like you @SenSchumer vote your crimnals home
I kind of like the colorful one... probably less depressing than looking at pictures of friends that I don't have.
#NetNeutrality
Your so full of it!!!!!
We don't
Can you tell me what buffering means and the difference between a localhost verse remotehost? , #DrainTheSwamp
I am a public school teacher. My students are why we need #NetNeutrality
I'd rather see you walk into freeway traffic blindfolded.
OK Chuckie hypocrite..
Or "The Reich believes this information is harmful to a free society".
