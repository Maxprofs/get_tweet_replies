Sorry 45 was already rich beyond his wildest dreams working his ass Off, Hilary is Rich beyond her wildest dreams selling out USA to Russia
trump is broke. When we see his current taxes we will all know the truth.
Hahaha... He surely kooks broke to me... Hahaha... I'm peeing my self laughing... so funny !
Change your panties, sweetie. We have only his word he has any real money. HIS WORD—All but Orange Kool-Aid drunks know what that's worth 
I think we have more than his word,if any of that was true, CNN would be ALL over it, but no. they worry about how much Ice Scream he eats
Then why did all the news cast are talking about his 2 scoops of Ice Cream... ?
Maybe because China may help with North Korea and he got a great trade deal and Germany is abusing our good faith...
Trump is so ignorant
he could not find China on a color-coded scratch & sniff map
with a flashlight and a guide
I would Love to be as ignorant as Trump, a beautiful family, a great business all over the world, with a name that's World known and so rich
Germany is in Collusion with Obama to take USA Tax payer money for their globalization efforts that only make rich globalist richer. Get it!
You're delusional like your president.
Yes ? And then why Obama was meeting with Angela Merkel while Trump was to meet with the G7 ?
More $$ deals with China and Merkel is a woman.
Angela Merkel is a girl.
Merkel is an educated smart woman, just the kind Trump is afraid of.
She's a badass who has a brain that Bozo can't even fathom having. She can speak in a doctrate language that his 2nd gr level can only wish
We've seen past leaders that got in their position because they could speak eloquently.  I'll take the 2nd grader.
You poor thing. Start with the Constitution. Now it has a few big words, takes time, but really worth the read.Hope it's NOT too hard foryou
Okay kitty Patty, While I'm reading the constitution maybe you could delve into History.
I read history. Getting ready to read the Warren report. Pretty damn interesting.
trademarks
Merkel is a woman. It throws Drumpf off his "charm" offensive.
Perhaps congress should follow the money & dead Russians instead of silently condoning tRUmp and team's illegal loans & money laundering 
38 new trademarks for POTU$ from China, Ivanka got 3 new trademarks. They're his customers. For-profit president #TheResistance #resist
Hillary isn't POTUS, catch up.
That's right, she isn't.  You got one fact straight. Congratulations.
1st payment by a foreign govt to POTU$ hotel was saudis, lobby in DC to urge Congress 2 repeal a law letting 9/11 victims sue SA. Thoughts?
My thoughts are still with Bill getting $500,000 for speech in Russia when wife was SOS. and the ties that Podesta has  w/Russia.
UR justifying Trump taking $ from the Saudis who want to repeal a law favoring 9/11 victims w/ an unrelated fact? So you're for it. Noted
You know what gives.

Bribery.
China gave billions to Trump (he hid Chinese "loans" from FEC), Kushner–of course they're sucking up to Beijing
China treats America far more unfairly than Germany, yet @POTUS gives China a pass & lashes out at Germany. What gives?
We all know he answer to that! He has business in China, not Germany. He's enriching himself off the presidency. #Emoluments #Constitution
He's trying to ruin us!
is doing He is the president like it or not get over it do your job that the tax payers pay you for help not go against
If he knew Deutsche meant German he'd back off his anti-german rhetoric.
I bet the Deutsche Bank quits loaning him $$$ and may call their loans! Oh wonder if he gets the $$$ from China, Putin, or Saudis to payback
That's solid connections work. You need to get out of that Disneyland world you're living in and come to reality. What do you really want ?
I like "..Disneyworld land you're living in..." better. But I'm east coast.
Trump doesn't like the leader of  Germany. He despises women. Angela Merkel  is no exception
True. Additionally, if the leader who was in charge in the 1930-40s was the current leader he would have a lot more respect for him.
Exactly.
China makes his shit and Germany calls his shit out
He's alienating us from our allies and smoozing our enemies, I wish elected officials would make that point when they're on camera.
Your response proves how little you know about NATO and Germany.
What business is it of yours Adolf Schumer?
It's his business because as a member of Congress it's his job to hold the President accountable and act as a check and balance of power!
Or it could be he's sticking his nose in places where it doesnt belong.
HOW would that be the case? That'shisjob. We are a democracy not a monarchy. I guess you never had a government class.
Adolf Schumer is speaking his personal opinion which has no bearing on policy.
Guess you dont know what a butinski is?
Yeah! Stay out of his corrupt business deals that effect American policy!
His unique ability to give respect to authoritarian governments & become intimidated by democratically elected ones. Oh- & Merkel is female
Is she ?    Who cares ? Race/ Gender politics had no place in the world.
@realDonaldTrump is an aberration of nature. Our expectation of him acting like a reasonable, normal hooman bean just won't work with him.
Melania  should have slapped more than his damn hand those 2x. I hope she writes a nasty book, gets real rich, while him and the bratsinjail
As soon as T is removed, I can't wait to see the War of the Roses between T and Melania. I want to be a fly on the wall in her attys. office
Bet she is outsmarting him up in NYC. She is gathering all of the ammo she needs and he keeps giving her more!  Like his casino odds
How does China treat US unfairly?

They emerged from Maoism and copied our culture & our economy.  They even copied our Federal Reserve
Maybe the German leader shouldn't meet w/ the ex-president and spit in his face.
That is such a  stupid question!
Congress and Obama took 18 trillion dollars from the American people,18 years of taxes,where's a balance budget,we still pay taxes,
Are the American people being made to pay taxes twice,why didn't congress balance the budget instead of putting the country in so much debt
because  @SenSchumer 's brain is filled with dog shit
Nato needs to pay up senator.  But I guess you don't either
Aw, shucks Chuck. The answer is as easy as "one, two buckle my shoe". Can't lash out at Ivanka's 0.62 cents/hour cobblers!
You had some other statistic ready if it had been the opposite. You will fight for opposite of what he says just because he said it
You really don't understand business do you?
Trumptaduduh and Dense Pence are not able to think this through.
WWI & WWII
Chaos & confusion. The comrade is lost & afraid.
haha you're saying this now.. really? hmmm I don't remember you complaining when Obama was in office.
And you give Hillary a pass for murdering ppl. Make up ur mind!
What gives? Incompetence & a delusional belief he's the best dictator in the history of the world.
I don't see china criticizing the US Sen Schumer.  I'm sure newspapers are hard to come by at the senate
HE hates women especially powerful women
45's a self-absorbed dolt. Probably couldn't pass the science section of the GED test.
Germany isn't hawking Ivanka's Nordstrom rejects.
Germany has gotten a free pass on paying their fair share for NATO. They need to step up and support NATO. They were the reason for it
#Putin doesn't like #Germany's focus on #renewables. Wants to sell #oilandgas & hopes ice melt stalls #Atlantic GulfStream, make EU #colder!
He owes the Chinese too!
china is handing out trademarks  and what else?
@POTUS forgets that China leads the world in production of solar panels - the new growth industry with jobs jobs jobs
I’m pleased to see by this tweet ending in “what gives” your admitting you really don’t understand. You be better off to keep quiet.
Most greedy president ever. Total crook.
a woman heads Germany to start but trump is an incompetenttent spoon fed what he wants to hear STOP HIM NOW!
Stupid Schumer how about corrupt HRC & your failed Obama presidency, apologies to all nations, weaken American economy, military etc
Trump does lots of business,with China.
Germany needs to pay up. all of those,dead best countries need to do there share.
What is the surprise?He is showing us who he is.Moreover,Pence is showing himself as well.Why is Pence silent?Cowardly.
Pence is a liar and a hypocrite!
Treason for sale. Trump and Co. sell America's interests for cash on the barrel head.
POTUS lashes out at democracies. JUST WATCH
You are a P.O.S. the Democrat Party are the enemy of the American  People you don't understand We The People have spoken Trump won
Chuckie Chuck Chuck, he's draining the swamp duh?  I'm only being sarcastic because it's my best coping mechanism...
It's his family and his business interest. He's making money in office for profit for himself.
YOU SAID I COULD KEEP MR DOCTOR - LIES YOU SAID THE DEDUCTIBLE WOULD NOT GO UP - LIES... now you want me to believe YOU...HELL NO!!!!!!!
Germany is not buddies with Russia and the cronies plus Germany sends great intel on misdeeds of trump & his entire family and organization
Cause all his trinkets and dime store crap he hawks and ivankas  target crap clothes are made in china.
Trump family has business in China, not Germany. Simple.
Follow the money Senator...
Maybe he's trying to get China to help with North Korea!  Why do you care? Ohhh, maybe you've some interests in Germany!!
China gave Trump family trademarks, Germany did not.  Not hard to figure out. Emoluments  What are you doing about it Senator?
Trademarks for our supreme leader and his daughter?  Unpaid loans?  Who knows...
No Trump hotels in Germany?
Hillary lies exposes our secrets  gets Americans killed and takes money from our enemies yet you persecute Trump what gives?
China pays him in patents
Bannon
Germany's IC is going to sink Trump & Co. and he knows it.
Your empty wallet
Ivanka got copyrights, remember?
Revenge for things said during Deutsche Bank lawsuit. He is pretty petty about stuff like that.
When did he lash out at Germany? Shut up Chuck don't u have work to do for your constituents?
he's an ass. That simple.
Blah blah blah
He owes china millions of $$$$$
He's making money in China now.  They wouldn't let him in until he became president...emollient violation anyone??
Chinese loans for his business 'deals'?
Also shouldn't have bashed Iran on terrorism without bashing Saudis on terrorism, also.
Isn't Germany in Europe?
Ah, yes... well, there's your answer right there.
B4 election, POTUS was... "informed"... that he doesn't care 4 EU
China provides slave labor to produce Trump apparel and financing for losing real estate ventures.  #investigatetrump
#FollowTheMoney
@realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump
Not a #convfefe but a Dementor
Listen to the globalist who loves all these countries. #fakeoutrage
Copyrights
Go get your shine box
Trump n Ivankas SHIT is "MADE IN CHINA" not in Germany
Follow the money! #impeachtrump
Because Germany -your grandparents killers- is supposedly our ally & a NATO stalwart so it should pay its fair share & if not be called out
Trump doesn't owe German banks nearly $1 billion worth of debt. If he kisses China's ass, his debt goes away.
FOLLOW THE MONEY.   Always follow the money with this idiot
$$& more$
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Nobody gave China a pass. You/Obama gave China passes for 8 yrs and you did nothing to stop it! Traitors!
Germany's leader has a #covfefe.
Dump is not smart, not intelligent, not creative or imaginative. He does not make good decisions.
I'm sure Merkel will miss the billions of $$$ she was getting in Accord deal that Obama set up to pay off politicians.
what gives?!! Trump's a fool and a beast.that's what gives.
Unlike Democrats, Pres Trump cares about America and all of its citizens - not just voters at election time.
LOL, you might want to look at who owns most of the real estate that has the name "Trump" on it 
#DontheCon and his daughter needed patents from  not . Follow the  with all things Trump. Self enrichment is the new patriotism!
Please stop 
Maybe unqualified, unfit Trump was REALLY lashing out at Angela Merkel--a true, seasoned world leader who could see through his BS easily.
His business ventures & Ivankas. His fav Germany bank got nailed 4 money laundering 4 Russia. Just Trump doing his bus. Not the US.
Retire Chuckie... American taxpayers are tired of you old Dems...
Because Obama is loved by Germany... and they have pee tape.
North Korea ?????
Traitor maybe?
Putin.
Because Germany is breeding terrorists, China is not.  Are you the only person who doesn't know this?
China is personally giving Trump loans. This isnt about US vs China, Germany, etc. it's personal. He's making money for himself.
Russia ?
Attacking your friends risks few short-term consequences...attacking your adversaries entails actual consequences. Classic bully move...
Guess it has nothing to do with debt and economics......
Really Chuck.... Every Pres has given China a pass...
Trump knows that Merkel knows everything about his law breaking, as uncovered by EU intelligence agencies.
Let's leep in mind that the EU intel is as close to Communist as you can get.
I think you know. Everyone knows.
It's time to get Trump OUT by any means. The damage is mounting and Russia has infiltrated our White House. #ImpeachDonaldTrumpNow
Not quite; Socialist Dems are going down HARD!
NATO more problematic to Putin than Chinese at the moment.
Didn't his family close some business deals with China recently. Remember Trump First policy.
Are you going to call for declarations of war against China and Russia?
What gives? Russia is 'what gives' with Trump. Our so-called POTUS is doing everything he can to Make Russia Great Again
Simple, he's monumentally stupid.
@Winking_Buddha @POTUS #trademarks
Maybe because it's a strategy for trade and for them to be on our side against N Korea.
its about business DEAL$ SUCH AS THOSE FOR IVANKA AND THOSE OF HIS OTHER KIDS
Putin.
Trump just declared war on the planet. I don't think anyone will send troops to help.
Emoluments gives
He is a lowlife liar and he makes money from the Chinese it's as simple as that
Answer Ivanka! Trade marks
No hotels in Germany
Could I say that China makes more impact on trades of America....it is big, if not pass may destroys both economics a lot..
He should lash out at YOU!
Could it be the Orange man is an idiot?
What gives. It's because she's a strong women. 45 doesn't like her
It's like when u're in jr hi school and u only want to be liked by the person who treats u the worst.
Does this surprise anyone?? ANYONE??  GERMANY  IS TRYING..BUT MAN IS IT HARD..
TRUMP THINKS HE IS LEADER OF THE UNIVERSE..NEVER!! JOKE
I'm still trying to figure out when you will help people get off welfare @SenSchumer . you're full of problems, but never solutions.
What gives is easy don't expect sanity from the insane #Trump #Resist #Impeach #Incompetent
@chbacon @POTUS We all know what gives: Trump's companies do business with China but not Germany. #FailingTrumpAdministration
Trademarks for their businesses in China. Do something!!! Get rid of this illegitimate potus
You know as well as the rest of us;trump's trying to turn his movement into a REGIME! Find a few Rep. that still have BALLS & IMPEACH trump!
Schumer treat POTUS unfairly, but yet POTUS give YOU a pass !
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
#ImpeachTrump
#ParisAgreement
Trump is acting on orders from someone!!  He's too stupid to figure this out on his own!
I think we know the answer.
Hmmm..... call your friends over in #Russia and make up more conspiracy theories.  No one cares anymore - #CryMeARiver literally.
#Resign
As Senator for 19yrs you have done less than nothing about the state sponsored industrial espionage China engages in. What gives? #Covfefe
China gets a pass on the climate accord. What gives?
How about your boy Obama, 8200 sq ft carbon producing mansion in DC,  just what is needed 
The RussiansRight ? Isn't it always the Russians
Follow the hotel development trail...
The Trump name is "Mud".  Generations of them will have their names changed out of shame.
i predict even the use of the name 'donald' will go down. like, who names their kid 'adolf'?
The word may have lost something
You've been trumped
Does that now mean  royaly screwed?
Instead of beat
Urban dictionary Trumped = groped
#resist #WeAreAltGov China has all of the OPM data on the Federal employees and their families, background investigations, etc.
Trump owes Chinese banks money. German banks must be calling the loans and he can't borrow from the Russians anymore.
#FollowTheMoney
POTUS runs with "his mouth in high gear and his brain in second", as my dad would say.
Cause we borrow $ from China to pay for excess spending. How about balancing the budget?Germany gives us the bill for NATO.
What's a matter Chuck? You didn't get any leaked conversations between @POTUS and Xi Jinping?
What gives?
#DemocratSuicideBombers
Chuck. 
Easy answer..

China kissed his ass = good guys

Germany (Merkel) basically told him to fuck off = Bad Hombres

Simple
@POTUS is very astute. He knows he can effect change with China. But suicidal leaders like Merkel are another story. The vibes are obvious.
It's in Russia's interest
Stand against wrong otherwise it will very late to recover from damages. America is falling.
