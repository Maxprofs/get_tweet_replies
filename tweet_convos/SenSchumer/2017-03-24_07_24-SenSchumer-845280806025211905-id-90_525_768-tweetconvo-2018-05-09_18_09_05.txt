@SenSchumer The ones fighting this do not have to use Obamacare-they are immune to the dire results we have to live with.
@SenSchumer Human n Civil Rights aren't just 2 issues . Get real or be removed from the top of real causes names stands for
@SenSchumer We should be looking out for those less fortunate, not undermining health benefits & supportive social programs.
@SenSchumer Your beloved Obamacare took healthcare from millions of working Americans. You're a Democrat Party hack.
You've got it!  Now live with it you hypocrite ! ;watch it implode!  Do you yourself have ACA?
@SenSchumer got your way. We should see what a day without working Americans would do
will your stuck with imploding healthcare. You stated on maddow, three mos ago  , you won't lift a finger ,
how does it take it away? Or does it open up competition that you're afraid to see succeed?
Why not concentrate on this? 
#dems #democrats #illegalsout

@SenSchumer OBAMACARE IS A DEMOCRAP FAILURE.  SHAME ON YOU.  FIX IT
@SenSchumer No! Only ones on it are getting it paid for or subsidized by the gov. And can't use it if it's not medicaid.
@SenSchumer The way Obamacare froze millions out due to being unaffordable?
@SpeakerRyan

@SenSchumer #fakenews
@SenSchumer #Wealthcare
This bill is amoral and so is trump and the trumpeters who are voting for this bill!
using an awful broad brush just because u disagree
PPACA solved little it was just a tax scheme. Supreme Court ruled only legal if a tax. Can't tax us into a state of freedom.
@SenSchumer Trumpcare is a massacre not a bill!
@SenSchumer THIS SIMPLY IS NOT TRUE! Stop lying to ppl! The only Amers that wont hve ins are those that CHOOSE NOT to hve it
@SenSchumer u means the people who were forced 2 buy #Obamacare
@SenSchumer 
Baloney. I have had health care for over 40 yrs. I don't need the gov to provide for me. I work > pay my way
@SenSchumer JUST PROVES #Republicans NEED TO WILL 5 MORE SEATS IN 2018...
gee maybe the millions can get off the dole and get a job! that is a creative solution!
@SenSchumer actually that's wrong as could be. Please read the plan before spewing such lies and garbage.
@SenSchumer any tears from you over this? I'm NOT AGAINST immigration, we should know who's coming in, like @POTUS suggests
@SenSchumer You are just another Communist Party doing damage Where and when you can. You hide behind sentiment, yet evil!
Get profit out of healthcare!
And they have poorer Healthcare . 7 months or more to see a doc. Look at the VA
Fix ACA by stopping the sabotage!
CALL EVERY NO or LEANING NO CONGRESS PERSON. #saveACA #FactsMatter CITIZENS are not just workers. #healthNotBombs
@SenSchumer #racisttrumpcare IS NOT GOOD @maddow @latinorebels @LatinaLista @LatinosMatter @Lawrence @AC360 @jaketapper @nbc
@SenSchumer blood on their hands if it passes, they don't care who dies, not their family members
You haven't read Obamacare. All your complaints are in it!
@SenSchumer civil rights can't force folks to become doctors
@SenSchumer if your rich or have a job your ok. If your unemployed or sick or have mental illness your done.
@SenSchumer not true just takes off illegals
@SenSchumer $1Million a day for 3,000 years is $1Trillion. Where's the money. We could've all had HC
@SenSchumer  americans stand up refuse to pay into this make it fail refuse to pay the fines and penalties refuse taxes
@SenSchumer leaving Healthcare up to individual States is a huge mistake. This is about have and have an have-nots
@SenSchumer 
Welfare
@SenSchumer  one way or another we will repeal this
@SenSchumer one insurer in NC high premiums high deductables dictate who our doctors are ACA is one f'n lie after another
@SenSchumer  wouldn't take it away, they wouldn't be forced to buy it. Lies!!!!
@SenSchumer Voting for TrumpCare means hating women, the elderly, the poor, and the sick, but loving lobbyists and payouts.
@SenSchumer talk about civil rights we have no choice with current health care pay it or be fined ACA is a damn joke
FIX ACA!!
@SenSchumer Not Schumer can do. He's powerless this go around. Great news for America!
@SenSchumer we Americans can't have you, resign Schumer before its too late.
@SenSchumer The country will be dancing on your political grave if the #ACA remains and is allowed to collapse on itself
How can these even consider this ? WTH is wrong with them ? No "deals" or trades of support are worth it !
I don't trust anything Chuck says. He has been proven lying in the past.
