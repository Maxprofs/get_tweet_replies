Fantastic
At least under Obamacare you demos kept the insurance companies very profitable.
.@SenSchumer again that's only $227.71 per person. How about Budget 101. You owe America fiscal responsibility. Stop bull shitting!
Well that's a good thing. Don't need to be dependent on govt.
That would be a good start towards a balanced budget. .@USRepKCastor .@SpeakerRyan .@SenBillNelson .@SenateMajLdr
Chuckle Boy. Can you share where you gets these numbers or is it a secret only you are allowed to know???
You don't know what you're talking about fear monger. Under Obamacare people can't see a doctor there. Their health cards are useless.
My state and it's senator's are indicating a "Yes" vote. Disgusting.
Everyone call your representative again over and over. We did it once twice we need to do it again, kill this bill
Where is ur proposal @SenSchumer? u didn't support Bernie in the primary along with the rest of CORPORATE DEMS NOW LOOK WHAT IS HAPPENING
Why in the hell is the AZ governor supporting this bill?
Does @SenJohnMcCain know?  Someone should tell him this bill decimates veterans. Trump thinks vets are here to parade about on 4th of July
Keep it up chuck...all 50 states......we don't want your Obamma care....period.
Govenor of Arizona endorsed this bill. @SenJohnMcCain  may vote for it. I guess he forgot what he said about open hearings and regular order
@SenJeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain @RepRaulGrijalva
Could? Why not lie & say will?
Great! That is 1.6 billion less deficit spending! Not much considering 20 Trillion plus debt, but start somewhere!
@JeffFlake @TeamMcCain @dougducey   wow, and this is good for AZ how??
Focus on lack of @USCBO score for latest unmitigated @GOP disaster. We want to see a cost before a vote. Block this bill until cbo scores.
Again and again blah blah blah blah!
Under the Universal Healthcare that you and your cronies advocate, WOmen would not get treated for breast cancer for 6 months. What's worse?
I love the uninformed who don't realize that their taxes will still pay for emergency room services when millions lose their healthcare.
Good ,maybe our taxes will be lowered!NOTTT we have to pay you and your http://ilk.you  should work for a regular salary like us
And @SenJohnMcCain is all about this regular order right?
Yet John McCain supports it??? 
We can now give them the Wall they deserve to keep out ur beloved illegals
Sch will lose thousands if he fails to protect the lobbyist which have him dancing like a puppet. #MAGA @SenSchumer Resign

Surely McCain is aware of this!
I call bull .
Have you pointed this out to the Arizona Governor, and/or the Arizona Senators? We are powerless; they have the power.
So did @SenJohnMcCain approve of this?
They have to be stoped. Most affected are the elderly the pre-existing conditions, special needs. Call them out !!
How?
yet @SenFlakeStaff and @SenJohnMcCain voting YES!
@SenJohnMcCain isn't gonna screw his constituents after all this @GOP BS, is he?
Tell the truth, $1.6b spent on illegal immigrants. I'm sure you just forgot to mention that though!
Did you tell the maverick,  @SenJohnMcCain ?
They want 2 apply that 4 tax breaks 4 the rich, we all know what they are trying to do. They must be beaten down. & NO 4 the effing Wall.
McCain doesn't care about that...only that his BFF has his name on the bill
Tell John McCain.
How much was Obama care I never heard a word when that mess was going on
And the Governor @dougducey is ok with it.
Hey Schumer instead bashing the healthcare proposals maybe you should try working and helping come up with something better
The #gop doesn't want them to participate. Read up about it before bashing it.
but but but "tax cuts for billionaires" "more war!". We have priorities cause US isn't the richest country in the world now you know
However as I understand Arizona's governor supports it; which will leave Jon McCain where. Unclear.
does @JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain and their governor know that? they're all in support.....
unfortunately NE shameful senators probably are too
Arizonans need to wake the fuck up! The candidate they helped to elect is poised to kill a portion of the retirees that call Arizona home.
Maybe you can talk to your new friend about that Chuck.
Gotta whip your supporters in line. Right John McCain?
That sounds great to me! Why r u on a special Cadillac plan? R u better than ur constituents? Try Obama plan like rest of us hypocrite
For those looking for graphics, there are more here.

Do you know how much WV would lose? Would like to contact Sens. Capito & Manchin. Thanks!
Great, the citizens of AZ paying back the Cash to Bill Nelson and Mary Landrieu for voting 49 & 50 on Obamacare in 2010
Remind McCain of this when you speak to him.
Good, that idiotss McCain deserves it!
Are you a grown man or crybaby?
Just tweet that to Senator McCain
You mean you and McCain will lose kickback money if this passes. You cant have you income lowered now can you?
Then why is Jeff Flake on board. Are you fibbing again Chuckie?
#AZ
AMERICA DEMANDS FULL REPEAL OF OBAMACARE having no insurance is better than this
And under Obamacare, premiums in Arizona are increasing over 100%.
@JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain you guys listening?
Tell Dems we want 2 try anything else over AHC and Universal HC where Gov is in charge of your health.  Could cull expensive groups at will!
AHC Act can't financially survive unless taxpayers support private insurance co's,   beyond premiums.  Pres Trump refuses Corporate welfare.
Dems shoot down Trumpcare, pretend 2 save AHC, even though they know it is DOA.  Will flip U 2 Universal HC, then horrible care, like VA Adm
There's no such thing as "Federal Funding". The Feds don't fund anything, taxpayers do. You seem to think it's your money and it isn't.
Hi how are you doing
Apparently ACA, Medicare and social security r not safe from repubs
UK has just announced, can't sustain crushing cost of universal HC.  Will deny care 2 unhealthy lifestyles;  smokers & obese.  Obese, 30BMI
Is that what Arizona voted for in November? If so thank you for your sacrifice.
SP/UK, lost 2400 Hemophiliacs 2 AIDS tainted blood.  How does this happen 2 so many, 20yrs after screening?  Did they cull the population?
and lots of lives of folks with pre-existing conditions.  Why punish Diabetics, Cancer survivors etc because they are battling a disease?
Because a free market system is better for society
UK has Single Payer.  They also have AIDS epidemic, offer AIDS test kit in vending machines.  Y not C "free" doctor?  No disease control.
Scaring U into Single Payer HC.  Gov run plan where "they" decide who, what, where & when.  But it's free?  Not free either, paid 4 w/taxes.
You mean they have that many ILLEGALS? WOW!
Too bad, Pres Trump had to pass the Accountability Act to make congress accountable 4our veterans health.  Choice Act over waiting 4 tretmnt
That should make Arizona senators a NO vote
Democrats talk from both sides of mouth , you cannot balance budget and increase entitlement programs. We cannot sustain Obama Programs.
Single Payer HC is free, but U get what U pay 4.  Pres had 2 rescue vets from SP/VA.  Passed Accountability Act & Choice.  Vets died waiting
Alternative 2 Trumpcare is not AHC. that plan was DOA.  Dems will flip America 2 Single Payer HC.  Just like VA Admin.  Pres had to rescue?
Need 4 Expanded Medicaid is direct result of the thousands of illegals harbored by Dems.  Bringing down our Gov, 4 sake of Mexican citizens
And Sen Flake is OK with this?  Repub senators who support this legislation trade their states' interests for questionable political support
Chuck means, Gov matches state funds 4 every person signed up 2 receive Expanded Medicare.  Covers healthy people of working age, welfare!
Support #MedicareForAll join @SenSanders and give health care to all Americans.

Why haven't you endorsed this bill yet, Chuck?  Donors?
MEDICARE FOR ALL
Perhaps that's because Arizona is a sanctuary for Mexican citizens who usurp healthcare and social services from American citizens?
Is that a corrupted CBO figure?  Or just another number you drea
Dreamed up...
Sounds big, but that's only $266.00 per person. That's less than one month premium of Obamacare. What's the big deal, Chuck?
I doubt the CBO has scored this proposed bill. Where you getting all these numbers chuckles?? Sounds a bit like fake news.
Funny,  I didn't think senators gave a damn about people outside their own states, I mean where have you and Nancy been for the hurricanes?
Voting for aid packages. Doing their job
I know ignore it for FaceTime in Washington.
Your state of NY has at minimum $1.4 billion in fraud! It's the worst state to live and retire in. WTF you and Andrew going to do about it?
Revenge?
URGE DEMS to Withhold Consent! Call Governors too! All Politicians stop taking ins. kickbacks & start working for the people #SaveACA
this is proof that ACA is a drain on budget and can't make it without taxpayers money adding to the enormous debt $20 trillion Let it burn
Wow.  Less money spent by the government?    Gosh...
Save your crocodile tears Chuckie, when you gonna back #Medicare4All? #WallStreetDemocrat
Guess some folks gonna have to get a job
Arizona will lose 1.6 billion dollars in funding from Cassidy-Graham.  One thing for sure, Flake is not looking out for Arizona.
Apparently, @JeffFlake thinks this is a good thing.  Not sure why
Just let the red states do what they want. Those of us in blue states can have universal care.
I'd support this if you were serious.  I bet you'd run out of money and look for red state help.
and under Obama it was "if you like your doctor you can keep him" and you what us to believe you now
Thats what you get for pandering to traitor slanders. I bet you thoughyt we were too stupid to remember
single payer healthcare for the democrats ONLY.  paid for by democrats ONLY.  that would pass. everyone else. free choice.
I like it
Chuck got Traitor McCain on the first vote but not this time. His butt-buddy Graham comes before Chuckie this time.
and under Obama it was "if you like your doctor you can keep him"
It doesn't make sense to me why you should get more health benefits for simply living in another state.  Cassidy-Graham is a fraud!
Anecdotal evidence
And Dems are down a senator too.  This may pass :(
Who?
why would the 3 Repubs who voted against the last one, vote for this one?
I thought they were getting money out of this deal to sway them, but apparently not 
Lol and Flake will vote for it.
Flake's getting primaried. 
#Deal
