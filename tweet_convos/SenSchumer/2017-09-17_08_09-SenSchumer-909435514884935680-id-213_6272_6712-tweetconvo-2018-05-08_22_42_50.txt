JUST OUT: Here's a summary of the Graham-Cassidy repeal. Yes, it's that bad.

Spread far and wide if useful. 
These people are mean spirited selfish people. They have no clue about what people want or need. It's their own supporters who will suffer.
AND THEY WILL NEVER EVER CARE.
Precisely.
Please everyone should re tweet this post, this bill is horrific
This bill is a disaster.
Pure evil GOP why do they want to hurt the Americans they serve.
I think the American people have spoken clearly and loudly, the repeal of the ACA is unacceptable, and our representatives must stand up!
17% favorability doesn't seem like a quorum to me. My state won't exist without it. I'm sure you've been grievously injured by the system.
Fear mongering, incomplete or completely false information and lies propagated by pharmaceutical companies and their lobbyists. That's why.
Actually, I'm a pragmatic conservative, not a moron. Obamacare needs fixed not dismantled, taking it away from MILLIONS fixes nothing.
My State dies without it. Already $600 million in debt and highest rate of drugs and disease in the country.
Ya Bc Obama care is fantastic, wake up morons, this issue needs to be bi partisian, and get it done so all can benefit
Then you do something Senator.  What ideas have you put out there for others to take a swing at?  Sit on your thumbs and do nada
Not at all- hey, Dar 'RUSSIA BOT';  @SenatorHassan sounds like she's fighting for the people! (Not the Kremlin) #GrahamCassidyNO #ACA
Maggie, support single-payer Medicare-for-all
Proud to have you in the Senate, Maggie. Stay strong and keep fighting for us. #KilltheBill #SaveOurCare
Vote to repeal Obama care!!!!!!!!!
Larry, you are so lucky there are so many of us willing to protect you from YOURSELF!!!
A betting person might wager that Larry is covered under ACA and doesn't even realize it.
I'd be willing to wager that Larry isn't a real person.
I am real and live in the great state of Vermont.
Thank you Senator.  Please stop this monstrosity

Is @SenJohnMcCain all of a sudden a yes on the #GrahamCassidy bill? R senators @lisamurkowski & @SenatorCollins all of a sudden, yes votes?
Citizens who PAY 4 HC hate OC; We can't afford it !  "Working America" is NOT Seeing  a Doc when should!  PASS TC Bill= Can Tweak it Later
#GOP fascinations w/ killing the poor & middle class must have deeper roots. Murderous threats from big donors, perhaps?
Really?  Smh
You willing to #HoldTheFloor.  We're ready to take to the streets
If you care so much about health care, why did you vote to waste an additional $100 billion that could've gone to healthcare?
UNIVERSAL HLTHCARE:
#Click_Visit_Order_Happy.
Don't bother reading it, the Borg have spoken, and all bills introduced by the GOP are bad, so let's go with that, ha ha. Hive mind ppl.
Don't pass this!
"you can keep your doctor, your plan and save $2,500 per year". ya, you delivered-a big fricking lie.  let's wait for the CBO and see...
your Tweet was quoted by @CNN
Cobbled together behind closed doors, a conglomeration of bad ideas and greed, it is a slap in the face to the majority of Americans.
Please explain how u will pay for this?  $32Trillion!!
She IS listening to her constituents. Nobody wants Trumpcare.
An argument against ACA is not an argument for throwing 20m ppl off insurance, it's an argument for improving ACA. Be a better person.
Sorry to hear you work literally every day. Doesn't sound a whole lot like winning to me. Maybe get a better job where you get days off.
Damn! GOP won't stop coming after our healthcare. Relentlessly attempting to deny medical treatment to Americans. GOP = cruelty.
Obamacare is unaffordable.  Oh my , what yo do?  Why exactly what the Dems are doing..... nothing
The Republithugs Bill (Trumpcare) has nothing to do with Healthcare. It is a "DEATH PANEL BILL" CREATED BY HATEFUL, MEAN SPIRITED GOP!
The Dems had better quickly come up with a fair compromise, cause if your not in the game you'll be thrown off the team. "2018"
Fear mongering  giving to Governors to take care of @NeilyaSmith

These Republican bills are simply inhuman! What's to be gained by hurting their own constituents? Each needs to be held accountable @ polls.
Outrageous! #Medicare4All NOW!!
#GlobalVaccineSummit. #injuredarmy
Dem Senators should unite & support Medicare for All - it may be symbolic @ this point but it shows Dems r united & stand 4 America!
NOTHING is as bad as ACA. You force me to buy shit I don't want. Every selling point was a complete lie.
The only danger is the Obamacare fiasco.
@ASlavitt  please, this can't happen.
It is INSANE that WE the people are fighting for our rights, against a taxpayer paid Congress, while they take huge ins payouts
Sounds ok if you want healthcare for a few.
Are we a third world country? That was fast, just took 8 months...
We MUST call all the applicable GOP offices AND FIGHT THIS TIME AGAIN like we did last time, for heavens sake!!!! @justtish7
It's like Groundhog Day every other week. They want us exhausted and tired, but they underestimate us!
Genocide.
Why are people going through these GOP crap health bill proposals for the third time? Don't they get it? People want decent health care!
Of course its a bad bill. Republicans wrote it!

This is worse than the first horrible GOP House bill. This takes us waaaay back.
We have to be our own Gandalf against this Balrog.
One attack after another.  It's pretty obvious these people don't care for us and need to be voted out.
#SaveACA I'm terrified of losing coverage because of pre existing conditions!
Maybe we can all have that senate health care!
just say #MedicareForAll  already and stop the ostrich game. GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT AND NEED!
Maggie, what can we do?
#SinglePayer
Note wording: Health Care Repeal bill. Guess we will be a country of 400 lb cyber hackers unless we all die off first.
Listen to your fellow Senator @SenJohnMcCain & @JeffFlake. AZ citizens don't want this bill to see the light of day. Stop the foolishness!
Lies, lies, and more lies! Pass the bill and give it back to the states where it belongs! Then move to improve!
#TrumpCare is back via #Graham/#Cassidy!  #ACA Repeal must be  STOPPED! “Andy Slavitt w/@chrislhayes #MSNBC” https://vimeo.com/234153418?ref=tw-share … #Resist
This is a rape of the poor.
Well Maggie, millions of ppl will be kicked off their healthcare insurance. Preexisting conditions are gone. What do you think you should do
Omg this can't happen!!!
GrahamCassidy takes health care away from apprx 32 millions ppl. It is simply shameful for anyone to support this abomination of legislation
#KillTheBill
What are @LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy. thinking? Are they tired of their jobs.#GrahamCassidy. Fix #ACA #obamacare .We will vote them out.
Yeah because the current fiasco of ACA is so awesome. When legislation is more than 2 pages, be warned.
I've called @SenCoryGardner he just doesn't care.
You mean that mo. Senator still in office WOW
What should never pass is..The reelection of you Sen. Hassan. When you make Political comments for politics sake, your a failure to all!
We need to fight it !
Speaking Out...What does that mean? Does it mean, whether it's good idea or not we will obstruct! Politics getting in the way of healthcare!

Fact.  The high rate of female deaths in child birth is DIRECTLY attributable to factors such as no access to affordable heathcare.
Fact.  ummerica is one of of only 13 nations where female death in childbirth have INCREASED in the last 15 years.
Please someone help us not pass this bill. Why do they want to kill Americans???!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fact.  more ummerican women die in the first year of child birth thn in sny other industrialised nation.
@Resist___45 @ASlavitt 
I couldn't agree more. Request townhalls folks
Resist resist resist resist resist resist till we drop
Mortality went up under the ACA. Why would anyone listen to you at this point?
Because he's trying to keep people insured, you stupid tit? Just guessing.
Oh so you're cool w more insured, more dead? Great idea
You're a senator. We are the people. We cannot let more Americans suffer thru knee jerk legislation!
Repeal without a replace will read draconian.

Somebody drive stakes in their hearts!
345,790 of your constituents disagree with you
Is there any upside to this plan?  Otherwise it is pure cruelty.
Hassan opposed #MedicareForAll. VOTE HER OUT and replace with a True progressive in 2022!
UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE.  Universal Healthcare.  universal healthcare.  Erachtlaeh lasrevinu
Why we must reach out and stop this horrible kill bill!
Another health care disaster put together by republicans. Do these people have no feelings or shame at all!!
So, it flatly rejects every #Marxist tenet of the #ACA, striking a blow to your totalitarian program of war, welfare and perpetual debt?
Lets make one thing clear the middle of the country understands that dem and repub are just looking for votes.neither care
You need to repeal aca now. Get with republicans and make a common sence healt care bill both dems and republicans can take credit for
Nothing is guaranteed. The health care you, average american, not worry about today you might need tomorrow. Speak out against this gutting.
Do you believe in not confirming a nominee based on religion?
Seems like a great deal for everyone except @realDonaldTrump base ... this should be fun
I can't believe what I'm reading you would think low income people were 2nd class citizens the way they want to deprive them of healthcare.
Whatever the new plan it must improve the status quo for all of us. No ones options for health care must be diminished.
CC: @SenateMajLdr @LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy @GOP @GOPChairwoman @SenToomey @SenBobCasey @RepBrianFitz @SenateGOP #GrahamCassidy
Fear mongering  will they agree to the same insurance  single payer system  will cost us in taxes @NeilyaSmith
#aarp help
Ladies, gentlemen, children of America, may we present your gift from the warm, caring Trump Admin and GOP. You're f----d and you're welcome
Kill the GrahamCassid bill ! Support and press a Win for the Bernie Sanders plan!!
I don't believe any elected official would vote for something so bad. Therefore, I'm not worried.
New bill No pre-exist no cob babies born w prob. Rate raised at anytime even when cov 4 yr. we stopped thm b4 w calls by thous StartCalling!
Just made myself check http://foxnews.com . NOT ONE WORD ABOUT THIS BILL. Lots of news about Hillary, Comey. #ACA  #universalhealthcare

This is the worse bill yet.
The people's voice needs to be heard -- LOUD and CLEAR. Disgraceful.
Y'all know that Graham, not Cassidy, will be subscribing to the crappy insurance they are trying to pawn off on the American people.
Support #Medicare4All #ProblemSolved Do you hear us yet, @TheDemocrats?
This.  Please mobilize and call!
I sent length faxes this morning using @botresist to protest #GrahamCassidy. I have little faith in my senators to represent well, though. 
Alert  Republican Zombie bill attack
But is it a pre existing condition??

Medicare for all
CALL YOUR REPS DAILY, DON'T LET UP. They THINK they've worn us down, that we're not looking or too weak now to fight back. CALL 202-224-3121
  #ACA
Obsolete bigots distracting the masses with ancient battles long over in the real world
Here's link to site to quickly tweet senators to oppose #GrahamCassidy http://www.factpower.org/healthcare-tweetstorm.html … has links to other info
Just like the D's shoved Ocare down our throats, reconciliation.
Goose meet Gander.
Honestly this doesn't go far enough. Full repeal better.
My diabetic son will never know if each day is his last.  Can barely afford insulin - pre-existing conditions NEED to be covered w/o threats
What you must do is get this broken peace of obamacare fixed, stop acting like school children on a play ground. Other wise midterms will.
Meanwhile, endless speculation about 45's tweets.
Going back to the 1950's is  good thing.  Just ask a Grand Old Plutocrat.
Please do everything you can do to stop it.

We can't let obamcare continue...
Shore it up as single payer is phased in. What we can't do is let any of the sinister GOP health"care" plans in or we're all screwed!
I'll wait until I hear and see the actual bill. Anything coming from Schumer can't be trusted. He's lied before.
Thank you. And please withhold consent. And run out the clock.
Apparently the Democratic Party has become healthcare gatekeeper against marauding Republicans whose only objective is tax breaks 4 rich
What we must pass is repeal of obama care u & ur whole pack of KKK dems passed without a care 4 american citizens
It is amazing how Graham presents himself as the GOP caring voice of reason when he's as bad as trump & way more manipulative. Watch ur back
It's worse than before Obamacare. This is like the 30s, 40s-insurance would mean nothing, pay for nothing
Agreed, @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems please get on this,  get information out there now, discuss @SenSanders plan after we are out of danger
This doesn't 'promote the general welfare' of the nation as you and colleagues have sworn. #ConstitutionDay  #noGrahamCassidy
FOCUS on coming #healthcare vote!!! Must not pass. Millions off their healthcare.
Please stop this bill!!!!
There's a Call kit floating around with each Senator name & phone#, seventeen total! I called then yesterday and left a detailed message!
If @SenateGOP didn't have votes for prior two attempts to change ACA, there is no way this will pass.
NO to single payer.
Call your representatives and tell them NO #SaveOurHeathcare
Thank you for taking this seriously. #KillTheBillDontKillUs.
Indiana citizens will lose all health care gains under #GrahamCassidy. Hoosiers, please RT and stand opposed to this threat @SenToddYoung
This is all bullshit. How can they sleep at night??
Yeah i'd believe you except @SenateDems have been pushing #MedicareforAllorNothingforAll instead of saving the #ACA
I think that was the plan all along. Socialism does not work.
Which GOP colleague  are most likely to vote no?
We trust you & @SenatorShaheen
TY

Lives are literally at stake.
Pls let us know if we need to call you every day to prove that to the #GOP


Repeal and replace Obamacare.
The #bots are swarming today!
We must speak out against ACA's unaffordable disaster,Dems' obstruction to replacing it & Socialized medicine as Sanders & other Dems want!
Maybe we should just pass it before we read it?
REPEAL OCRAPA-CARE!!
You Democrats pushed flawed Obamacare plan. Keep doctor keep plan save $2500. Remember.  You created this mess!!  Such #hypocrites
We're calling our reps daily. Hope you have strategy to fight this, Sen. Hassan. Please read this thread:
1: #GrahamCassidy is far *WORSE* than full ACA repeal. This is not getting much attention.
Folks TAKE ACTION NOW!!! They have gerrymandering & Subprime Court on their side. We'd need a veto proof majority to undo this!
Withhold consent
Things to come will Benefit majority & every special population u guys need a waaaambulance
Got to wipe the Obama slate clean this is how it's done talk time procrastinating is over get to work it's no surprise things have to end
Hope you'll work with Trump administration & create a great repeal/replace plan. National Competition, tort reform, safety net, affordable.

@SenSchumer Looks good to me! Y'all are playing Peter Pan with our taxes. I'm done paying for those that won't work&illegals.
We assume both will provide real time readout of this plan or is this a leaked false document?
Nancy & Chuck have been lawmakers 30/18 yrs. U have been in ofc 8mo! creative/POTUS will help U. America voted in OUR AGENDA/PASSAGENDA?????
Bot
WHAT IS bot?
This isn't going to stop until the republicans get their way. Working poor dont deserve the same healthcare as the wealthy.That's republican
Government officials are better than all of us with better insurance and walls around  their estates.
Still a bot
Bots gotta bot
I thought Rs were against death panels?!? Seems to me they're deciding many of the poor and those already sick should be lost for $$ reasons
You know it'd be nice to actually read #medicareforall so we can scrutinize it like the Republicans are allowing us to do. Show them up!
Everyone is in a rush to remove a bill they hate. With no diligence they will leave many Americans behind. We have to improve or retain ACA.
And retaining it will cause bankruptcy for the middle class.
Rushing away from something you believe wrong does not guarantee you will arrive at what is right.
Jordan in Berlin: Former Americans Talk Europe's Medicare For All
@SenSchumer @NancyPelosi 
The GOPers will take out their ire on Americans for your attempted deals with Donny.
Thank you for the summary!
How can 32 million lose coverage? Only, what, 10 million covered? Many having to drop this year cuz of cost.
Look at source an @TheDemocrats hack who wants people on the teet of government.
As someone forced on #ACA, #ACA is one of the worst things that happen d to my hc, my work and my wallet. #failure
Don't be sheep and take what @TheDemocrats put out they want to control your lives and they really DO NOT CARE about you.
My premium up 600% my deductible up 400% I lost all my childhood docs of 40 year. This is a #failure
@TheDemocrats pander to get votes. They are full of 
I'm in va06 with the traitor preacher, i don't support the bill or his involvement in gov.
