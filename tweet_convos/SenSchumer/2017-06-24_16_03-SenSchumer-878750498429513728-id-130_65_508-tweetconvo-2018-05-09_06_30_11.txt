START  interviewing familes of 3 in 5 DISABLED KIDS THAT WILL BE CUT! AMERICANS NEED TO SEE THE LIE GOP IS TRYING TO FORCE ON US
CONTINUE TELLING AMERICANS TO CALL YOUR  CONGRESS PERSON ASK THEM BIG QUESTION: DOES HEALTH CARE BILL CUT YOUR TAXES ?
Hi Crying Schumer Happy now? No Russian collusion with Pres Trump, instead it was Obama, are you pursuing to have this investigated?
aranyosak...kell ez is! puszi
Try doing something constructive Chucky. You'll be wondering what happened in 2020 when (a TRUMP ) ??? wins Another  election.
I have a Trump hat for you the next time you go to one ....
All would have looked better in a #MAGA hat
Yea. Ass hats. And you're the biggest one.
Ok I have my #MAGA hat ready... 
I hope you wore your very biggest and best asshat. Socialists like you need really, really big asshats.
MANY don't realize this "bill" is a tax cut. It's not getting thru on the NEWS!!
This bill is a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans! Not healthcare! I hope more talk this!
Schumer, who gave you the TRUMP, make America great hat?
I didn't think libs could have fun.  Don't y'all just want to kill conservatives?
Disgusting comment.  Keep the hate going. Make America mean again
No words of condemnation on #JohnnyDepp threatening President Trump? Your silence is disgusting

Great but figure out how to stop overtaxing us who pay your salary.
You should retire and party there every day. Although you probably would put up road blocks to keep people away from your neighborhood.
