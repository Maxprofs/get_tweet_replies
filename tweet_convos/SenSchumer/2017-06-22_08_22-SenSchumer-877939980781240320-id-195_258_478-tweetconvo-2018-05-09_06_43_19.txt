The Dems always go back to the same statement "tax cut for the rich". If Obamacare was so good why are so many insurance companies leaving?
No, it's an alligator in goldfish slothing.
A sad man with a sad brain:(
You would know much about a wolf in sheep's clothing with you lyin cryin ways. Misleading Americans by spreading lies through the media?!
@senchuckschumer is nothing more than a smuck. Like Pelosi, he will soon B removed from his leadership role. Both are pariahs to the D party

Why does everybody blame @NancyPelosi ?
What has she done wrong?
What is her sin?
Has the GOP fared better?…
Same reason everyone blames Trump for Obama's failures....get the picture?
I don't get any stupid picture! Nobody blames @realDonaldTrump for Obamacare failure.Trump wants it dead & not ready to help. He hates Obama
Trump isn't the only one who wants it dead. First my premiums doubled then my provider just totally opted out and left me with no insurance.
Wow!
Says the man who knowingly lied after being informed that the president wasn't under investigation.
Bull hockey! There are none so blind as those who will not see. Trump has been weaponized by Putin and aimed at us! Help GOP do it now!
Have an in with Putin and he told you this?  So tell me.  Why are you not concerned that Obama knew about the hacking and did nothing?
If it were true I would be very upset! He tossed out spies,confiscated two large properties and announced to the world Putin hacked election
Barbara, if the voting machines are not attached to the internet, tell me again how they hacked into the machines?  Let me guess.  They got
No Schumer you are the wolf. Obamacare took away medical care. Nothing could be worse.
S,  is lead wolf in a pack of wolves!
Remember how U passed Obamacare!
Instead of all your BS, why don't you get off your high horse and work to fix it.  @ChuckSchmuer in sheep's clothing.
We love when you cry.
And he hasn't even read bill. Nut job
Schumer is by far the most corrupted Democratic senator of the lot. He was on the CFR at one time and is a great buddy to Soros.

@SenSchumer Obamacare was the wolf in sheep's clothing.
Because it is an excuse to disrupt and slow down anything and everything. Get to work  just do your job. If you don't want to resign.
Trump is a ravening wolf. He is a weaponzed gift from Putin, Russia took aim and elected him.
No, that would be OBCARE..AND A HUNGRY WOLF AT THAT !!!!
You are a liar and you lie to the American people you need to stop right now. You knew the president was not under investigation and u lied
Schumer to Pelosi.."getting real tough to get those damn voters to believe anything we say" Pelosi.."let"s put it in writing that worked B4"
Debbie wassyourmouth is on lieing and CNN does not even challenge her.  pregnant or have breast cancer you will not be covered. #FakeNews

Who writes these speeches for these idiots? Did all these dementia suffering senior citizens come from the same gene pool? #monkeys
Go on. Fight for us!! Think you
And Chucky is a useless obstructionist hack
Chuck the smuck! There is no way you read this before attacking it. The good of voters is not your priority! The obstruction of Trump is!

Isn't Chuck a s wo sheep in Wolf's clothing?
How could he even had seen it at that time? Can't trust a guy who speaks w/ out reading it.
Republicans are all wolf. No wolves are nice creatures the GOP a scum . A bunch of Ali Babas
So are you
You are old. Enough said. Go away. Term limits for our representatives
If cnn is fake news..then you people are Russians
I hope the Trupets dont mind giving up social security. I have mine..but i dont think you will get yours. Haha
Hhhhhh
Sheep so what does that make you mr schumer? 
The DNC is the wolf.  All you do is lie and obstruct our POS.  Keep it up and we will continue to win!
Those are some rough looking sheep.
Please don't insult sheep everywhere!
As well the #Obamacare
Until Democrats take a stand against aborting a million babies a year, they can just shut up about the Republican Bill "killing people."
Xjail for these Criminals
Wolf is sheep's clothing R u shore ur not talking about ur beloved obama care Cause it is a wolf that eats its young Its a complete failure
No. It is the Wolf.
@SenSchumer Obamacare IS the wolf devouring the working middle class.  Oh, that's right, dems could care less about us.
Tax cut clothed in Healthcare bill.
@SenateDems  Same goes for Obamacare. We were told we could keep same doctor, families would save $2,500 a year, costs would be minimal,etc.

If we could build a #wall from lies, Trump could afford a wall around the earth, like Saturn's rings. @GCHQ @EPN @EmmanuelMacron @AbeShinzo 
While he and his gang of crooks r wolves in wokves clothing?
lol like obamacare that obama took to Supreme Court as a "tax" because he could not get it passed in senate..
That's an insult to sheep everywhere
Give Chuckie another six and Nancy Girl another term.  GOP loves them!  0-5.
Crying Chuck get in the back of the bus with the rest of your degenerates
I'm tired of the sheep in wolves clothing. Always mindful to tell people what they want to hear only to find out they're just a politician
SCHMUCKELS IS THE CORRUPT DINOSAUR IN AN OLD SUIT.


Because they are democrats and (supposedly) for the people.


Have you read it or are you just condemning it

It is now safe to say that Americans will more likely die from lack of health coverage than a terrorist attack. #truth #NoToAHCA #shame
And a slow and painful death at that.
Chuck Schmuck is got to go
Like CNN, Schumer is irrelevant.
Fake news fake congressman fake witch hunt America voted against this over and over. Keep it up so Trump wins again and again
Actually it's a wolf wearing a paper sign that says "sheep". They're not even trying to dress it up as healthcare.
He really should read it first.
Please Chuck, please keep telling us what we need ;)
I wouldn't trust him.  He was lying to you. He was told Trump wasn't under a but he kept letting people be put at risk.  All for his ego.
I was saying this as a joke
You forgot the lol.  Or maybe I'm.just tired
SUCKER
And Obamacare is what.....?Ready to implode its a disaster!! Hey Chuck you should jump ship the Dems are nothing but whining obstructionist
It's not even in sheeps clothing. It's just a wolf.
You need to look in a mirror to see what you have become. Put down Sal Alinsky's Rules for Radicals & stop this "resistance" to Constitution
The bill is a plague flea in a Norway rats pelt.
No senator, progressive Dem's are "Wolf in sheep's clothing". How soon u forget  process Dem's used to get the ACA shoved down our throats.
Who's writing this crap for you? You need to up your game Senator. Horrible message. Horrible. We don't need Mister Metaphor. Brass knuckles
With all due respect GOP doesn't give a shit what they do 2 win Time to fight 
"Trumpcare  Say Goodbye To Nana"

#resist
so is the President.
And you and yours are thieves with eyes on more of my hard earned money!
A wolf in wolf's clothing!Protesters @ T halls shut it down once b4, by R's! If bill  improving, would b made public.Its not,so they cant.
Do you know anything but to scare and lie to people that's not your job shame on you Obama care is dead stop trying to preserve it
You retweeted a Fake News Network Chuckles
Is anyone surprised? This is exactly what I thought it would be. Deathcare for the poor. Christmas for the rich!
Then opt out you have that option now! Didn't under Obamacare. Remember!
Same old crap from you. Change Den leadership in Congress if you ever expect to win again. Your stale, infantile analysis fails again.
Did you really expect him to say ANYTHING positive, Not
You didn't read bill before you read prepared statements...completely buffoon!
Buffoon? How about, "We need to pass the bill so we can read it!" That's a buffoon.
Birds of a feather...well in this case, Buffon flock together. Neither want to read the bill lol
Hilarious the party that said we could keep our Drs and Healthcare plans --->
Good
It's actually a wolf in wolf's clothing screaming HEY I AM A WOLF
so is CNN
Actually, it's more like a wolf in a slightly smaller wolf's clothing.
Where do you think the wolf got the sheepskin? That's all that's left after #Obamacare… @TheDemocrats
Like Obamacare
Yes so where's the message where's the alternative? All y'all do is b**** b**** b****
Come on Chuck , give US tears crybaby 
What do u stand for Schumer?  Oh, is it u just hate Trump?  You lose again.  Get used to it.  He's here to stay unless you find a pltfm.
whereas obamacare was communism cloaked in capitalism
Shouldn't Schumer read the Bill before he makes an evaluation? It's not 2 thousands pages long like Obamacare!
Heartless people do heartless things.....but the lobbyists are very happy $$$$$$$$
I miss senator Reid. Schumer is too nice!
What???!!!  Did he even read it yet?
2/2 a salary to do a job and they take an oath, that's not the reason they take the job, it is  for power, influence and money, not salary
Ha ha ha  and how do you know this?  Your word exposed your reparation. If Jesus had Co wrote it you'd called it crap
We need to get legislation that takes away all future government benefits for politicians who are taking lobbyist money, They get paid (1/2)
our government has sunk to a new low, American people are being lied to or misinformed by all sides. I am ashamed that we have come to this
how stupid does Washington think we are? Everyone there has their own agenda including all the news networks and lobbyist. follow the money
NO BIG SURPRISE THERE.
DC it self is a Wolf in Sheep's clothing.
DEMS LOOSE AGAIN. BAHAHAHAHAHA
If you want to fix healthcare Chuck, quit and take 20 Dems and 10 RNC with you. Let the people elect 30 new senators. Problem solved.
More like a wolf in wolf's clothing
Once again using the word (MAY) either it is or it's not. I am a Dem. But I'm tired of Gop/Dem dividing us. Work together for the people!
What does that make Obamacare...a wolf without clothing?
Can we get someone to read the bill for Chuck.
More like a wolf with a paper bag over its head, pretending we can't see it.
@SenSchumer is the epitome of a "bleeding heart" Liberal. Surprised he didn't cry.
#CryinChuckie would know everything about a "wolf in sheep's clothing"!
I just don't get itwhy are the Republicans making it difficult for the poor? Are they trying to kill off the weak & engineer humanoids
Well Chucky, maybe you should cry about it and see if that helps.
Looks like Trumps paid for trolls on here today. Pathetic.
None of them have attempted to defend taking away healthcare from 24 million to fund upper end tax cuts. All they have is ad hominem bs.
McConnell is a maggot. Saying Schumer didn't even read the draft. POS statement! I've read the draft. Internet is a wonderful tool.
Destructive language is easy.  Try comg up with ideas for your party.
Try coming up with ways your party has helped Americans.
More than 1 million new jobs for one thing.  Republicans have listened to voters.  Voters don't want Socialism. Dems don't get it yet.
How about you pay for everyone's ObamaCare being you IGNORE the extreme rise in cost while on YOUR WATCH.
This clowns are so fixed in Russia since November, have nothing to show for and have produced nothing for the American public.  Suck it chuk
Suck it chuk should be a hashtag, lol
Health care is not a right. WTF came up with this idea. Get off your ass, get a job and pay for it like I do.
Cryin Chuck
U need to pass the bill to see what's in it was ok for the democrats #CnnisFakeNews #ALTLEFTMEDIA
The DNC ACA was a failure.
Waaaa.  Waaaa... Waaaaaaa....... Cry Chuck.
So are many of the GOP
Obamacare Sucks your the wolf Schumer
He is full of bull.  Was he sober?
Because it's so Baaaaaaaaaaaaad!

more like a wolf in wolf's clothing imho
It's a wolf in wolf's clothing. Stop pussyfooting around it so much. $200,000,000,000 in tax cuts for top 2% while poor lost insurance.
You haven't even read it 
Wolf=tax cut for rich.
How would you get the economy going?  Tax cuts for the poor makes them more dependent.  46% of wrkrs pay NO fed tax.  What's the answer?
Liberal rhetoric run amok.
