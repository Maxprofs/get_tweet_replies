More important than helping hurricane victims
Chicago's finances in the toilet. Illinois $130 billion pension liability + $15 billion bills. WTF are you doing?
Any statement on Democrat senator  Menendez corruption trial
and watch your Senate colleagues lie -
They are not anymore special than any other person trying to get citizenship support President Trump
When White America reaches minority status will you be in our corner too?
@SenSchumer Total a**hats. Putting illegals before American citizens. Won't do healthcare but will give illegals free pass.
Regan gave amnesty to 3M illegals, now we deal w/36M.  Compassion, seen as weakness.  They disrespect our laws, and diminish our own ctznshp
Vote Dems out!  Will trade your vote 4 that of an illegal.  Recent election has proven voter fraud by illegals.  If U legalize U won't count
No Dreamer Act!  This is tip of the problem we will have if DACA stays.  Next stop DACA families & open borders.  They will negate your vote

where were u in 2008? the man who stopped Associate Justice Estrada? shameless. @realDonaldTrump these r snakes
When you cannot manage the big city nor the state, and cannot stop a years-long crime wave, why are you doing this?
A K A "let our illegal voters stay. We desperately need them to win an election."
So the hate American citizens act is back
Daca is illegal, unconstitutional and a slap in the face to all inclusive my family that came legally.
America first… Not the illegals
Check out @GOP's Tweet:
Dems called on Ted Stevens (R) to resign immediately in 2008. Why would it be different with Bob Menendez (D) now? 
Dick, get to work and do your job.
I'm not stupid and I'm not afraid of what president sending this to Congress to make a legal plan for us to stay here stop lying
Where have you been all these years? Shame on you & DEMS!
meanwhile - violent crime in Chicago gets no Senate attn. 

I hope for 100% turnover in our useless grandstanding senators
It would appear Dixiecrats once again defending agricultural slavery in US. Have we learned nothing from history?
How many do you think know who Dixiecrats were? Most in 20's can't ID the VP or Joe Biden, can they?
#DACA
In the 70s my brothers worked on tobacco farms while in high school. Those jobs are no longer available to our youth - they have been taken

I'd rather tune in to see you protecting and defending The Constitution !!
#DACA

Could you guys be any more milquetoast? Please, someone for the Democrats start throwing bombs against the republicans. Voters respond to it
If you never called our service members Nazis,  I might go along with the Graham Durbin bill.
Oh we will...and we will then KNOW where all of you crooks stand...your already standing on one leg hopping around like idiots...time tokick
It's a shame you don't care about the children born in the USA as much as U do #IllegalAliens 
Instead U penalize working parents 2pay 4 it
Sounds like a bitch session! Stop complaining and hold a vote! You have no intention of passing the #Dreamact do you? just going to pass!
Instead of serious discussion you want to try and pass the same tired act again.  No wonder you can't get anything done.
Why do y'all worry more for illegals than America citizens
Why dont you take up issues for Americans. I can give u sad story after sad story needing u to work for legal Americans more worried illegal
Call for its demise.  No DACA
That's nice,  then do your other job by helping Americans with tax reform and healthcare, glad to know we are second on your list. USA first
No! Waste of time!!

America 1st!! PERIOD!
I don't like listening to whiners.
The former DCVAMC director is BACK at woirk after his facility LOST 150 MILLION in medical supplies. NOT FIRED! YOU LIED!
Your latest Choice Card allocations were a LIE. The VA is telling veterans TODAY that there is NO MONEY for that program left. YOU LIARS!
Hope you have better luck  than the racist House did.
You need a permanent law immigration reform
500,000 vets STILL awaiting care and 480,000 STILL awaiting appeals decsision. You people are total INGRATES!
Because the system should work on them one at a time???
What not any of the DACA people had a chance to apply for citizen ship. What did they thank was going to happen in the future. DUMB ASSES.
YOU HAVE NO CALL TO SPEW THE SAME SACRALIGIOUS FILTH! SHOW ME THE BIBLE CALLS YOU AS THE CHOSEN ONE IN THE BY BIBLE!! GOD MADE US ALL#

STOP YOUR SLAVE TRADE AND MURDER. DISBAND YOUR RACIST HATE FILLED PARTY.  TEAR DOWN YOU SYMBOLS OF HATE.
I can't stand the wait to see more GOP Congressmen betray their voters. I wonder how Collins, McCain and Murkowski will vote.
You do realize obama had 8 years to do something. If anyone betrayed their own voters are democrats. Unconstitutional DACA was best they did
Absolutely correct_they still do. What does that say about Democratic voters. Either real stupid or lots of fraudulent votes. OK maybe both
