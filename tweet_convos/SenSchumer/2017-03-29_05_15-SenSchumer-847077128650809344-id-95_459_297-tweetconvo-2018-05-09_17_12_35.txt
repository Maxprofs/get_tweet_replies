@SenSchumer What about OUR rights to privacy? I want part of the money then.
@SenSchumer oie
Apparently the Repugnant Republicans are monetizing rights. The more money you have - the more rights.
@SenSchumer did-
Israeli Occupation Forces shot dead a #Palestinian young girl in front of the Damascus gate, in occupied #Jerusalem a short while ago. 
HAHAHHAHA - LIKE ITS NOT ALREADY THERE?? Ever see your GOOGLE RIGHT COLUMN?? It's already being done!!
@TrumpTroller62 let Congress' info be the first released. #TaxReturns #illegitimateelection
@SenSchumer rat maggots also voted for the same
Yet another sign the US is in a state of collapse. Depressing that our country & it's values are being systematically destroyed
Fake .....
@SenSchumer @joshharkinson SELLING our private info!How low could the GOPs/trump administration go? #HillaryClinton #ImWithHer
Why didn't the Democrats oppose this?  Oh yeah, Democrats love the surveillance state, ask Obama.
please reference something other than liberal hack websites a sources if you want to be credible
Umm.. Fake!  Browsing history was always for sale.  Target advertising existed for a few years now.  Have you seen the ads on your websites?
Isn't that like Pres Obama using NSA for surveillance of private citizens communications?
@SenSchumer 
Ouch, oo oo Ouch!
Cut the propaganda. Looks like it was democrats trying to pick winners & losers again. I'll trust GOP over lying liberals every day.
@SenSchumer Please spare us the BS! Anyone can get any info they want. Wikileaks hacked the DNC over & over didn't they?
I want my cut!
@SenSchumer Senator, is there anything we can do about this?
@SenSchumer is this going to benefit the rich and hurt the small guy? That's what this administration does best
@SenSchumer that's pretty cool!
@SenSchumer Well,hope when 2018 comes you Dems.,reverse this. It's ridiculous. By the way does this include Gop too or not?
THIS IS CRAZY... WHERE DO I FIND WHO VOTED FOR IT... IT INCLUDES HAVING TO OUR EMAIL, WHERE WE SPEND TIME ON WEB!!!
what can we do now?
We cannot/Will Not tollerate further profiting on a Service we have paid ISP's to use. #ISPSPYONUS
@SenSchumer Just Republicans?
@SenSchumer Verizon sold this info 4 awhile. There,'s a opt-out feature they don't tell u about. Read it on another site.
@SenSchumer are we sure #Putin isn't calling the shots?
@SenSchumer and the left just stole it under Obama. Your point is?
@SenSchumer this is NOT ok
Orwell's 1984 #Bigly Brother - absolute power...
Faustian pacts R US
Oh what a pile of crap!
Buy stock in companies that build & sell VPNs - now.
@AllLeftNews Of course they did. Each of those bastards would sell their own mothers, if they could get away with it.
@SenSchumer 
@SenSchumer Repub congress doesn't listen to the ppl, only listen to those throwing $$$ at them.Doomed in the election.G-bye 
@SenSchumer 
My cellphone this morning had an ad for a program I could buy that will protect me from all this.  Thank you @GOP.
@SenSchumer hypocrite liar and just unethical Chuck you were okay with Obama giving your internet away
@SenSchumer where was your outrage when Obama let our internet be sold to a foreign business
@SenSchumer Honest question.  Why does GOP want to let internet providers do this?
Oh Look Hillary Clinton & the Democrats not the bad pick for running the US!! #trumpregrets MUCH!!
@SenSchumer Wow.. Sad day for cyber security @tedlieu @weareoversight @SenSanders @Lawrence
@SenSchumer But Obama took complete control of the internet while he was dividing the country by race and wealth!! Look it up
@SenSchumer 1984 is here
@SenSchumer It is all about money with the GOP. Hope their dirty laundry gets sold to so it takes them out of their seats in WA
Won't the GOP be upset when everyone learns their browsing history contains porn?
Really? THAT'S your biggest concern? 
@SenSchumer Set up a VPN
Guess we need to "delete history" everytime we are done with that session.
You're not understanding how this works. They're tracking you live as you are on the web, always, and can track across devices.
They know where you live, what you like, how much you make, your relationships, hobbies, education, pretty much everything.
This isn't science fiction, it's marketing, and they sell all of that info AFTER overcharging you for cable/internet services.
@SenSchumer someone tell GOPs that letting corporations write laws is different than free market capitalism. It's kleptocracy
@SenSchumer I think #Trump made his fortunes and is ready to be impeached.His goal was 2 reverse everything the Birtha pres did
let's start with their's....
Are ALL republicans crooks? They're letting Trump do whatever....
Is already was sold by Obama, so does not make much difference
@SenSchumer the forgotten men and women of this country will be forgotten no longer
@SenSchumer 
Idiots!!!!
@GOP @DNC While we're watching the self-destruction of the Republican party, techies get to work! Ask providers to make a stand
providers make money selling 2 third parties. Read the fine print.
we should browse sites to F with them.  How do I become a celebrity so women "let" me grab 'em by the...or how to CYA using " "
scary! Surveillance State here we are. Perfect positioning for despotic Donald
if you were worried about privacy GOP voted against you
conservatives favor big business over people. Any person voting for GOP votes against herself.
Everyone who signed up to ObamaCare got their info sold to outside companies. #duh
They already do folks. He is called Mark Zuckerberg.
Difference being ppl opt to use FB. Our option with ISPs is not to use internet. #Internetprivacy
we r going to buy GOP's info
use browser like #DisconnectMe
They'll see a lot of Zullily, Yummly, work related sites, Twitter, and anti-Trump history in mine.
*our
Mother Jones writing "yours" like they're exempt from it all.
internet providers promise to not sell our data and we'll switch to you. @ATT @verizon @XFINITY
how did these assholes stay in office?
Because their voters are old white male rednecks who probably don't have computers. #StopPresidentBannon
