The president can take advice from whom ever he chooses.  I love his choice, as do many others.
Hello Sen how POTUS keep all his children in the WH and give rankings to all Next little Barron gets a job. Amazing
NO. Heritage Foundation is evil. No nope nope no.
Judge Gorush is the perfect judge for the Supreme Court! He will fight all of the Dems liberal policies!  Dems Anti America
It's #JudgeGarlandsSeat. Besides don't know if Trump is legitimate president. #Trumprussia
this isn't even similar to what reid did. if mcconnell goes there it MUST be challenged in court.

A judge that was unanimously passed by democrats previously.
Trump is the most ignorant, laziest person to ever sit in the white house.  His temper and judgement are dangerous to all of us
It's time for you to either step down or be expelled from the Senate. We The People Voted and your obstruction and fabrications must end
Please stop the partisanship it's time to unite as Americans. Time to find common ground
So? You dems have your "lists" too.
Niel Gorsuch will be the new Justice regardless if you filibuster. #PickAFightYouCanWin
This judge can not be beat. You don't vote for him it will be your loss. He will be seated.
Chuckie, stop whining. He's well qualified, supports the rule of law, and disavows judicial activism. Of course you dislike him.
Yeah, and?
And Dems use left wing sources...let's be honest here!
Do we see a tear  in your eye. Maybe there is some child you can yell at for wearing a Trump hat. #UseLess
Chuck piss up a rope
#45 doesn't need any stinking advice . . .

Dems had no objections to Gorsuch before so why now?  Hypocracy.
He can choose who he wants
