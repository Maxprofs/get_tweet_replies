What I hear from Republicans is: you either need to be healthy or rich, or else you're not worth keeping alive.
Unless you are a fetus. Let's start calling all Americans "advanced fetuses" so the GOP will give a damn about them.
Yes, this might work? Umm, let's not abort health care for the long-term-fetus health care plan?
Nailed it.
@BillCassidy it looks like you're building quite a name for yourself.
Hey @BillCassidy & @LindseyGrahamSC , coverage that is unaffordable IS a denial. THIS BILL IS WORSE THAN ALL PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS. #Resist
It's like, "Well...that one failed. How can we make it more Draconian? More evil? Surely more Republicans will vote for it then?"
nice one
When & Where did you get your Doctors license, @jimmykimmel? Literally no one cares what you think. We The People do our own research better
What a complete hypocrite @BillCassidy! What did they promise you to sell out 32m Americans out of their Healthcare! Karma won't be pretty.
ARE ALL REPUBS GREEDY LIARS?    "YOU BETCHA"  and TRAITORS! AND PUTIN'S PUSSIES!
SO! JUST ANOTHER LIAR KOCH SUCCOR REPUKE REPUB! VOTE CASSIDY OUT!
Pretty disappointing your talking points came from Schumer. Why not ask someone not directly involved before disparaging a man's character?
GOP is caving to pressure from super rich who demand their tax cut NOW or donations stop. They wouldn't spit on regular folks if on fire!
That but won the how-much-do-I-look-like-a-goober contest
Hey @BillCassidy: You lied to @JimmyKimmel’s face on live national television, and he knows it.
Opinion | On health care, Cassidy flunks his own 'Jimmy Kimmel test' http://wapo.st/2xLQA4G?tid=ss_tw-bottom&utm_term=.29f51c27800f …
You lied to the father of an infant with a heart defect…about protecting infants with heart defects. Remember this??
Charging a woman 17,000 dollars for a pregnancy will just increase the # of abortions.
Try 50000. Don't forget the hospital stay. That's only if everything goes well. I've worked in hospitals for 10 years.
On the other hand, it would also prevent policies from covering abortion as well…starting in January:
No one has anything to explain to the buffoon, "Jimmy Kimmel". HE should explain why he uses and derides the poor little Mex security guard.
please call your Senators --     and share
@BillCassidy Sir....you're simply lying to the American people...WE"RE NOT STUPID!!! We can see what you're doing....stop this insanity!
Who gives a shit what you think? 
Hey Bobby, for one who doesn't give a shit about his thoughts you sure wasted a bundle of characters and a shitty emoji.
Funny, like I give a crap what you think here's one just for you.
@BillCassidy lied. What else did you expect? #GrahamCassidy is a pack of lies.
I just called Senator Blunt's office in Missouri. I asked him to please define "access". I'm guessing it means lots of money.
'Yep.'
's pinned tweet:
twitter idea for 2017: find real things to be mad about.
Graham-Cassidy flunking the Kimmel test is most definitely something to be mad about.
Louisiana & South Carolina
are not hotbeds of ideas
Nazis and KKK are more their style
Thank you, Jimmy Kimmel, for giving a damn and using your talent and platform to speak up for the rest of us.
He's messed up
Anyone who supports the Trumpcare lies is selling their soul to the devil. It would destroy Republican lives and bank accounts too. SHAME.
Jimmy Kimmel is no healthcare expert+has no legal expertise to know what the effect of a Law would be. If he is your quote,you're infantile.
And violates the oath he took when he became a doctor "First, do no harm".
1/ What a slimy creep this guy is. He's a doctor. He knows the score.I suspect he operates his clinic for profit.

@jimmykimmel @robreiner @rosie. Can you publicize a demand that congress must get insurance plan in their bill that givesLEAST cov 2citizens
I hear @GOP did it for $400M from the Kochs
Tons of  @jimmykimmel for standing up for #SaveHealthCare !!! NO ON #GrahamCassidy !!!!! #ACA
.@jimmykimmel calls #GrahamCassidy Bill a SCAM!!! #SaveHealthCare NO on #GrahamCassidy Bill!!!!
You go Jimmy Kimmel!
Thanks Jimmy. We all need your support and motivation in the fight for real healthcare. You are a real person.
Rampant hypocrisy.
JK don't let him used U and your family's pain 2 further his murderous agenda Please! now u know what others feel everyday! Use your voice
Koch bros. withholding their 'upkeep payments' to GOP until they ram this  'healthcare' bill through.   Traitors to the US people for $$$.
The South rises again. Robbing the American people of the right to quality, affordable healthcare.The republikaners of the confederacy.
Shows you how far you can trust a politician heart of gold right?

Still mad at you Jimmy. We don't care right now what you have to day. Go pet your puppy trump.
What you have to say .... Maybe later. Maybe not.
He is a liar
This is why people hate career politicians. This is why nobody trusts a word they say.
He wanted your media attention not thinking that they would try to repeal again. He's a slimy opportunist and a disgusting human being.
Deplorable
@BillCassidy how could you lie to @jimmykimmel
Back to the good'ole days? No thank you. 
Improve ACA, and/or move to singlepayer/choice. But backwards? NO NO NO NO NO NO NO No     just no
Medicare for all would not cover Kimmel's son either. Numerous restrictions for Medicare.
It's not just about Medicare for all. It's about healthcare regardless of circumstances. We have brilliant minds here. Shld figure this out!
These same people gave us Obamacare, that was a disaster. Not too brilliant in my book. We can't cover millions of people for free.
ACA needs work for sure and many people were helped because of it. Why not fix what's broken instead of starting over. That's the insanity.
Dem said they have plan ready we need to compare before making any decisions.
U know nothing more about politics then these folks that follow U blindly BC U are a celebrity. Tell them to find their own way. Stop this.
This bill hasn’t even been studied.  Tell these folks to read and study it themselves, not to listen to you and other celebrities.
I am for Obamacare, but if this is studied and found better at State level and helps people, we do it!
I have a lot of political practice, in war and peace time.  Pass this to other Hollywood, that they need to let there fans know.
That they have no more knowledge than a farmer in Illinois.  It is embarrassing these folks blindly follow your lead.
Thank you, have a good day.  I look forward to seeing this bill torn apart and see who it helps and hurts, to make an INFORMED decision.
Sorry for all the spelling errors, hard to type on the phone.  Carry on.
They don't care about people or their health care! They are trying to pay for their rich people tax cuts!
He's getting off killing millions of ppl 
Every picture I see he looks like he's loving this
We need to take back the USA
#cassidygetbent
Another fucking GOP liar
Did you really think a republican cares especially this one just basked in the applause you gave him
You took an oath to Do no harm. Your bill harms the entire nation!
Oh, he had his fingers crossed. #gop #hypocrite

- If Cassidy is right and his bill protects all who are protected by ACA, why repeal ACA?????????
Thank you, Jimmy! Wish my Senators from Nebraska @SenatorFischer @SenSasse (@BenSasse) cared enough to put health of country before party.
@tedlieu @JohnLaprise Between the unconscionable UN speech by trump & the abysmal G-C bill, has the US hit a new denouement in governance?
Somehow GOP will get away with this catastrophe this time
The cruelty of this is really incredible
Jimmy, @BillCassidy is one of those smiling Republicans that you have to be most afraid of. He is a liar hoping to be a murderer.
He looks like a joke
As a doctor and a human being, Cassidy should be ashamed
Cassidy either doesn't understand his own bill or he is a blatant liar. I'm going with the latter, because it fits the pattern.
Cassidy is lying about his own bill. It puts a cap on coverage.
Again, Republicans in Congress are on this states' rights kick. Has nothing to do with decent health care.
He's does not care.
He flunks the compassionate human being test.
GOP (& we) NEED to stop calling this vicious proposal a healthcare alternative plan. GOP never wanted/doesn't want one. It is a LIE.
Jimmy, you gave Sen Cassidy a platform. Now the senator is going to screw millions of people. You should be skewering Cassidy every night.
The bad news is that Cassidy's douchebag removal surgery is no longer covered.
MSNBC missed this while interviewing this twit.
Doesn't make sense... right??
Far be it for me to tell you how to run your show, @jimmykimmel, but I think you should consider visiting Bill Cassidy at his home.
Trump has normalized lying and going back on your word.
Thanks Jimmy, so sorry this happened at all & hope you're energized and appreciated in this most vital fight.
Phoned Sen ron rohnson to back away from latest non-HC bill. Do everything to not hear will of majority. Totally lousy US senator from WI.
Cassidy is a hypocrite. He will lose in coming election.
the way to resolve is CAP Law suites CAP Mal-practice this will lower rates
and allow for plenty of plans
Cassidy will never get a full night's sleep again if his "DeathCare" bill is voted in by the Heartless GOP. 
'
SUCH A TRAITOR FOR THE INSURANCE LOBBY, $248 MILLION BIG GLORIOUS BUCKS STRONG:
Very bad combination of unethical people combined with a feeling of vulnerability for being completely inept. I give you, the AHCA part 2
Please repeat your story tonight on healthcare. #KillTheBill

 Dear @SenatorCollins  

 PLEASE  VOTE "NO" on the  #HEARTLESS and #EVIL #GOP #GrahamCassidyBill …
I cannot understand why these representatives are trying to hurt so many... it's exhausting fighting the people elected to look over us.
@BillCassidy is a Louisiana Republican. The shocker is that anyone actually believed that he cares about women, kids, minorities...
Jimmy, I'm with you re: healthcare. On another note, why would you have Spicer on your show?
@BillCassidy Jimmy Kimmel himself calls BS on your claim to uphold the Jimmy Kimmel Test in your bill.
I will never laugh at Lindsey Graham's shady bitch ways again, no matter how shady or bitchy. He/Cassidy are shitheels of the highest order
All Republicans lie.  All day every day.  @BillCassidy lied to your face @jimmykimmel and he knew he was lying when he was saying it.
Keep fighting for US Jimmy.  Loved you on The Man Show and now Late Night
Expected better out of you and Graham. Nothing but lies about the Jimmy Kimmel test. People will die!!!
these stupid scumbags must have accepted Russian money...no other explanation
#Cancer Women, Please send bills to @SenSanders' lake house, they'll b lost w his taxes. @ShaunKing @MarkRuffalo @WaywardWinifred @MMFlint
See Jimmy they only care about their funders not us
@SenJohnMcCain knew @LindseyGrahamSC was workingon more heartless plan w/Cassidy.Voted NO on Mitch's plan cuz he knew thiswas in the works.
I hope this comes straight down on top of Cassidy and Graham !!!
He failed the Kimmel test. He failed the children. He failed America. Stop #GrahamCassidy. Keep #ACA.
Actually @CNN entertaining convo #trumpvindicated is waste of time when it's not the same thing...#manafort TY @maggieNYT
Shameless
What a dick.


Why don't they just give us the cyanide laced kool-aid now, & get on with it? Oh, right, it has the word aid in it.
Obamacare not the answer/ built to fail / needed bipartisanship but Obama refused/ told them elections have consequences
Obamacare rates up over 100% in several states/ why is this good Jimmy
Obamacare now with no insurers in several states and insolvent
Obamacare is horrible insurance as most patients cant afford deductibles and don't get care and have to pay anyway
I was promised my rates would go down by Obamacare or Jimmycare instead they skyrocketed / not right
These men are without honor and only want one thing. A country poor and uneducated.
BTW: it was obvious he was lying to you about that 
Jimmy, call that SOB out on your show tomorrow 
Cassidy is as bad as Kobach in his own way.
Apples and oranges, but the same level of malevolence and malfeasance! Way to go Cassidy Graham!

Why has this not been RT by all your followers? This is life or death to many if our fellow Americans Wake up people and STOP #GrahamCassidy
@chrislhayes @washingtonpost Congress & Senate must share our fate and have same healthcare as they give 20 million Americans

@SenMajLdr @SpeakerRyan The @GOP only care about financial welfare of the Top 2%.
The Graham-Cassidy bill is nothing less than evil-EVERYONE PLEASE PROTEST TO YOUR SENATORS&REPS-and remember this when it's time to vote

Depends: If @senatorCassidy believes Health Care 4 New Born Babies is Privilege/ Right. @SenatorCassidy believes Privilege @SenJohnMcCain
Thank you, Jimmy! I'm so happy you didn't let this asshole get away with his attempt to manipulate you and your audience.
To Bad he failed!
Cassidy sure did flunk showing what a failure the new Fraud healthcare would be. He was flailing and failing. Earned F.
He would feel differently if it was his child or grandchild with the pre-existing condition,  unless he can afford millions for lifetime HC.
WTF is wrong with Cassidy and Lindsey Graham?
Is this the piece of shit that was on his show??
Judgment day is reelection day
Stop #trumpcare #stoptrump and the corrupt, cruel white old men of the GOP #MondayMotivaton #tuesdaymotivation #WednesdayMotivation #resist
Like Trump, another GOP monster.
I have a kid born with birth defects...cleft palate/lip and hydrocephalus. Met lifetime limits ages ago. The ACA saved us. #noGrahamCassidy
They All lie, hurts Our Vets, elderly, handicapped and so many more. Makes me sick 
The GOP whipped him. It took a while, but now he's got religion. GOP whip scared him, bribed him, found him something more productive to do.
This is worse than last GOP bill @BillCassidy. Why are you doing this? Did you think we wouldn't notice, when ppl's lives depend on good HC?
Imagine, a politician that lies
Cassidy flat out lied to ALL of us. He needs to go. NOW. #SaveTheACA
He lied to you on your own show. He deserves to be called out. I hope to see that very soon.
Cassidy also flunks 'basic humanity'.
Cassidy smacks of the stereotypical politician who marches to his donors'targeted interests, constituents' needs easily disregarded.
Graham and Cassidy will go down in the history books as baby killers.
Gop are could care less about the majority of Americans.This will be a Life vs Death for millions. Please keep calling your Senators
You should have him on the show to explain.
But he took an oath to "do no harm". I guess that is to do no harm to insurance companies and big pharma.
Cassidy is a charlatan.
Clear that @BillCassidy is the worst physician in American & should be bared from practicing medicine ever again.
They shud remove his healthcare program. Just deserts !!
@SenatorCassidy you flunked the Jimmy Kimmel test you vowed to meet and you wrote the bill WTH!!! #SHAME
@SenSchumer @washingtonpost  I am not surprised at him, but I thought Sen. Graham was better than that.  Very disappointing!
@MoveOn @SenJohnMcCain Pls demand Regular Order. C-G Bill is a sham. AZ Gov isn't thinking about the country. #VoteNo #ShamBill
Your lie & fail of the #JimmyKimmelTest with the Graham-Cassidy bill is on tape @BillCassidy.
Opinion | On health care, Cassidy flunks his own 'Jimmy Kimmel test' http://wapo.st/2xLQA4G?tid=ss_tw-bottom&utm_term=.29f51c27800f …
So he lied to you when he told you that care for everyone was a good start. This bill is not good for America. #resistGrahamCassidyBill
#MedicareForAll
Cassidy is a doctor!! How can he, in good conscience, screw over his patients, constituents with this horrifying bill?Because of a deadline?
so sorry that this man gave you and so many others hope on your show and then to do this. hope your baby is fine everyone needs healthcare
@MoveOn @dscc SLOW DOWN bill-use every tool U have. Demand Regular Order & CBO score-Demand witnesses. Pls save ACA #ShamBill
Hope your son is still doing well. And thank you for what you did for the rest of us.
This man is pure evil and it's reprehensible that lied to your face on national television! Louisiana please vote him out next time he runs!
Recall now he is a Nazi  profiteer how many in his state will be destroyed  how many ???
You should invite Cassidy back on your show.  I doubt he'd have the guts to accept, though.
This bill is more Draconian than the last crap they tried to put through.
Not surprised. Pathetic.
Sponsor a. I'll to force GOP to have same benefits as this great fair program  the GOP should have these benefits.
Cassidy is a douchebag
This is exactly why we need people like Jimmy Kimmel in politics. Do u ever consider it?
Make your voice heard! #lastword #GrahamCassidy
Trust me, I'm a doctor. Scary shit.
Thank you for advocating not just for your own child, but for children like mine, @jimmykimmel. #GrahamCassidy
 “What Medicaid Does for Kids Like Mine” 

#ACA #SaveMedicaid #Medicaid #BCRA #ACHA @SenateGOP @SenateDems 
When you invite these kind of people on your platform, you validate them. Stop chumming with scum.
"This is a lot of fun!" Jimmy laughs, giving the worst people on Earth exposure. "Nothing bad will come from this!"
These people are some of the most despicable people in this country.
Dear God- just raise our taxes & give us decent health care. With what we save in premiums & copays & deductibles it won't be any worse!
Sometimes money is more important than human caring.  Very sad.
It is the GOP Nazi mantra  this GOP is the worst group of liars in history   The worst
Thanks, Jimmy
Cassidy-nasty when he was standing w/Miitch when McCain gave the thumbs down-they looked like angry racists attempting to bully a sick man
Cassidy, Graham,Heller,Johnson are unprincipled amoral hypocrites along with anyone willing to support this abomination
