#NetNeutrality is government regulation of the Internet. It is the antithesis of a "free and open Internet". Is why @SenSchumer likes it.
We need to get more ads down. 767 blocked while posting this.
George Soros, Chuck Shumer and Nancy Pelosi want net neutrality to stay in place- proving net neutrality rules should NOT stay in place.
They also breathe oxygen, proving that O2 is a threat to humanity.

Flippin' 'eck, man, even a stopped clock is right twice a day!

Opposing something because people you don't like are in favour of it isn't a terribly clever strategy.
It's a good starting point.
It's illogical.
Dear Chuck Schumer , question - did you know the internet is actually a bunch of computer networking hardware laughing at humans ?
You gave these corporations their power. And now you think an op ed will make a difference?
WAKE UP& SMELL THECOFFEE LIBS! UNLESS YOU ARE 4CURTAILING SPEECH! @SenSchumer is a wolf in sheep's clothing!

Correct me if I'm wrong but interned was originally founded by DOD. So it belongs to the tax payer. Not everybody
No to #NetNeutrality
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I AGREE WITH YOU
Yes. The internet was designed for the people and all equal access
Not designed for corporations.
Yes Dumpy Corrupt Trumpy s &  all cohorts!
I own a small business that depends on the internet. The idea that I could be charged more for my biz site is really worrisome!

Then hey chuck. Why is this really a way for web scale companies to get cheap labor and have citizens pay for their unfair advantage. Liars
ANYTHING that comes out of YOUR mouth is trouble! You're a communist as long as you're on top!
It also gives access to the truth. Politicians & MSM don't own the ink any more.We can now make educated decisions without demagoguery.
It's amazing to watch you look over your glasses and watch your mouth move at the same time.  Ur a real Pro.
Business prospers until politicians decide to help. You will only create a problem w/the internet. Look what you have done for Health Care!
Medicare runs fine. It has less per capita administrative expense than for profit healthcare run by corporations
Please protect us all from the Trump administration.
We need more protection from America-haters like Chuckles Schumer. Somebody please vote this treasonous rat out of office!
I believe in what Charles saids.
The Land belongs to the people. And what has happened to the land will happen to the Internet
The fed govt and FCC belong to powerful corporate interests.  Therefore, the headline doesn't vibe with your prescription.
Internet does belong to the people cause fake news is telling lies SO PRESIDENT TRUMP is telling us the truth cause you and news won't
LIAR THIS IS A LIE.  ABOUT CENSORSHIP

Yeah and that's why the internet supports @realDonaldTrump and wants crying chuck to get out of his way
How Chuck???
Hmm doesn't George  Soros  operate it?
U want independent non censored Internet u reel in the Islam politics from NYC they can dress & prey all they want keep yr hands off USA gov
Free and open like the Obamacare you rammed down our throats.#idiots
CHUCK SCHUMER OBAMA BERNIE SANDERS ELIZABETH WARREN TEACH DEMOCRATS BELIEVE IN GLOBAL COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT! THEY PUT INTERNET IN UN CONTROL!
Prefer to listen? Check out our new podcast on the history of #NetNeutrality and why it matters:
1984 style double speak.  Government take over the internet is not happening, Senator.  Give it a rest, we are smarter than you.
stop stalling Trumps nominees, if they fail they you have something, but to just stall is childish
Thanks for standing up for this, @SenSchumer
Please vote to SAVE Net Neutrality!
No kidding! Wow. Do your corporate contributors agree?
So why did obama sell it than
Soundin more and more like suppression to me.
Keep fighting HARD for continued 'Net Neutrality" .
If so Chucky, why did @POTUS44, @BarackObama plan the UN Takeover Of The Internet - ICANN
What would u know about the people u self serving racist bigot
You must be mistaken - The Dems nor Hillary aret in the White House.

Keep gov out of my internet.
Do people know. That you have only sponsored 8 bills in you're 30 year career as a lame poltican?
Our country also belongs to the people. So stop with all the bs and do your job!
STOP YOUR OBSTRUCTION!
We the people are watching!
Not from your Propaganda Machine Mouth #liberallogic
Tell me what an IP address is and how it is configured, Once you can do that then you can lecture me on legalities.
Chuck....
Best response I've seen so far. 
As one of your constituents, I'd love to know what you're doing to stop sharing of our data. See: Trump's data guy:
You're worried about Trumps guy? The Dem party has 3 Muslim brothers working as IT guys for our government. THAT should concern you!
Maybe if you took time to watch the video you would get it.
Xfinity has already pledged to continue #NetNeutrality for its customers, showing the private companies can act more decisively than gvmnt.
@SenSchumer is an Obstructionist using @SenateDems to sabotage the @POTUS Presidency
"no time for internet"
