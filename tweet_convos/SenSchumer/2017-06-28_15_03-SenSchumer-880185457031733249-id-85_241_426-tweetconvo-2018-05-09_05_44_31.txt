No more WE vs THEM. You need to openly garner the relationships with senators who ARE willing to work across the aisle.  OPENLY. Show unity
Senate allowing the minority of GOP who want strong partisan politics. If those who want bipartisan work DESPITE them, things will get done!
Chuck serves no one but himself Lines his pockets, doesn't care about everyday citizens His values aren't in line with us He is for himself
Are you kidding me Chuck Schumer a #Neoliberal #Neocon Democratic Republican Lite. #wednesdaywisdom #SaveOurCare
Good idea! Call ur Democrap senators & thank them for the ACA that is failing. My premiums up 110% & deductibles now $10K ! I lost my doctor
I called both my Senators and told them both to get rid of Obama care. Lost my doctor 4 yrs ago, huge deductibles. Thanks for the reminder
I did call in support of the cuts
@realDonaldTrump  way wrong  the USA does not want to be a socialist state, we want smaller GOVT control  this is where the DEMS DONT GET IT
Based on the act of Mr Schumer, I cannot take anything he says as fact or trust his judgement on bills in Congress. #replace #DrainTheSwamp
it's over chuck. #outlawtheresistance
Please bare in mind that your dealing with nefarious and  clandestine republicans, who care not about the poor!
They've long failed at embracing the ideals of a democracy, haven't they?
#Obamacare was designed to fail. http://www.trevorloudon.com/2017/06/exclusive-the-enemies-within-the-healthcare-agenda-video/ … #FullRepeal
Fight? What fight? You guys aren't even in the fight....your losing....badly.
****You're****

For any liberals who might want to correct my grammar, I'll do it for you.
It didn't work you got elected
Chucky, we do no want Obama Care, we want affordable medical care. For your information that is not the same a unaffordable insurance.
Obama death care is done
First, NO more bickering?
You want health care then tax the Dem topay for it where does it say in the constitution that anyone has to pay for your Obama care 
ACA is a failure. Biggest fraud perpetrated by corrupt liberal scum in our history.
save our care so that it can fail completely!  That's schmuckie @SenSchumer idea of fixing! Crisis! ACA is failing! what don't u get?
Im Nevada,  only 20% of the state is covered now, and diminishing. Are you going to pay cryin chuck?
my senator, @SenToomey, doesn't care. He'd rather support Trump than his constituents.
Please introduce laws that will hold POTUS of good character.
YOU REALLY DONT CARE! YOU(DEMS) PASSED OBAMA CRAP CARE! NOT REPS! B/C of OC(crap care)Ins,IT NEARLY COST MY OWN SONS LIFE!YOU'RE NOT FOR ALL
In the first place mr. Schumer it's not your care
Keep up the false words to ur pack chuckie It only helps to solidify ur self serving racist bigot personally
Barrasso: '#ObamaCare is a Bus Going Over a Cliff - The Dems Say Stay Onboard'
Schumer's my senator and I say go reform the system, it is broken. Do ur job!
your friends are all going to be indicted I doubt they will be able to assemble for your 'resistance' #loser
#SaveOurCare  http://freebeacon.com/issues/trump-schumer-doesnt-seem-like-a-serious-person/ … Really? While Trump visits with the Cubs & golfs?
single payer is no care

Calling @ThomTillis @SenatorBurr every single day #ncpol
What does America do about its' maniacal president???
#SinglePayer is what we want. @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer
Distraction
@SenateMajLdrScared
Holding vote 'til after July4
#AHCA#GOPDeathPanels
#TrumpDEATHpanels#BCRA
CALL Sens
Per #Indivisible:
Mitch has an itch...perhaps we can scratch it with these calls... "Just say nyet!" to the so-called #BCRA...
Those of us who pay for other people's  "free" healthcare can't afford the $6000 deductible that YOU forced on us. The fight isn't over.!
The majority of people, 58%, don't want trumpcare, call your senator, if the vote it in, vote them out, that's how you fix the problem
Playing political games with people. We are just pawns in the political agenda.
Stop fear mongering ... Year on year increases just not to the previous admins ridiculous numbers ...
What care? #Obamacare sucks! Just like @BarackObama thank God he's gone!
Do you have Obama care or are taxpayer money paying for your insurance, you are a hypocrite!!!
#SinglePayerNow Do what is right for the American people not for your donors.  It is time to take this country back from the likes of #trump
Single Payer doesn't work. Get the govt out of my face. Put healthcare in the private sector where it  is actually effective. #FullRepeal
There's no care, Obamacare is unaffordable & unavailable even Dem who voted for it exempted themselves & buy the old insurance but ppl can't
pay 100% for you and your family' insurance. (2/2)
you really need to get out and see how the real world lives.  I'm sure you don't have ObamaCare, hell I'm sure my tax dollars (1/2)
Can't stand this pos liar. Fake and phony. Why doesn't he have obama care if it's so darn great?
He wants to stop a new plan bc his goal is to let O'care collapse so that he can push socialist/communist single payer. Will destroy US
They are the gimmie, gimmie, gimmie people.
I don't want you to save Obamacare , I want you to push for single payer for everyone #SaveOurCare
You want health insurance? Buy it!
When people have no insurance go to the hospital, I pay more in increased premiums to pay for them. A flat tax single-payer system is needed
The hospital should not treat people who don't want to pay. Want healthcare, get a job. I never agreed with SCOTUS finding.
No. Your care sucks. #repeal. Do not replace
Read my lips,  we don't have to have to support Planned Parenthood.  Not part of our values.
As far as new insurance, who expected you to like it. Remember you are a servant for all the people.
You love it so much, why aren't you the first, to sign up with your beloved masters insurance, Obamacare?
....let's all call for Sen Schumer's resignation!  He's been bleeding us taxpayers for all he can get for way to long!
Y'all see Schumer ain't doing anything to fix ACA just an obstructious
Hey Senator we hare having a 5 day sit in at our Senators office here in Birmingham from 10 am until 5 pm friday we aren't leaving
Enough money for everything except health insurance?
shove it
