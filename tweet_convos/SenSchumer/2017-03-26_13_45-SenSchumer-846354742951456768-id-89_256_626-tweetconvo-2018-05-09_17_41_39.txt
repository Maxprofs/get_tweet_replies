@SenSchumer everybody hear about chuck going off on a citizen in a restaurant, great leader huh
@SenSchumer The utopian paradises of  Venezuela & North Korea await. Perfect for you. Starving populace & selfish leaders.
@SenSchumer So you can protect terrorists? I don't get you. You obviously don't care for this country. Why don't you move?
Never was any web privacy and never will be.
@SenSchumer chuck you getting a kick back from Facebook who already does this??? Hypocrite
Confronting a #Trump voter in a restaurant the way you did was shameful. GROW UP SNOWFLAKE
@SenSchumer thank you for protecting the American people while the @gop working on selling my grandmother
Well the Dems own it now. I'm sure 'granny' is saved w/her wonderful OCare plan.Pray she doesn't get sick
we all own it and it can be improved if people are willing to take the time ...
Nope- it's ALL on the Dems. I take NO responsibility
@SenSchumer Well I hope your happy, you & your party screwed the pooch!
@SenSchumer Hey  Chucky! So you want Nunes, who exposed the truth to step down? That's classic dummycrat.
@SenSchumer they can always get your info even if you have regs
When we pay a fee for a service we should be able to expect privacy for that fee.
@SenSchumer If you cared so much about the American public then you wouldn't want to flood our streets with possible ISIS agents!
@SenSchumer the Democrats gave up US control over the internet
@SenSchumer I hope your ego was not damaged too much, oh that's right you respresent the people, who voted you in. nice....
@SenSchumer Please do your job!!! Privacy is a joke and a waste of taxpayer money!!! GOVERN

You Had Your Time, YOU #FAILED, Sit Down Schumer
Schumer's spouting more liberal propaganda. Dems can't speak without uttering nonsensical lies and bullshit.
worries about protecting our privacy while invading others privacy #ProjectDragnet http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/03/chuck-schumer-loses-goes-off-trump-supporter-nyc-restaurant/ …

@SenSchumer Mr Senator the whole DNC Hdqtrs was hacked. Try protecting the US GOV 1st.Matter if fact start with government leaks.
Yet he does nothing.
Schumer is using U all as cover for his radical Left positions.  Shameful really. But he'll gladly take UR money.
he sold out the ppl long ago. Wake up America. 

Nothing neutral or credible abt @SenSchumer
@SenSchumer Please SenSchumer keep fighting for us. Thanks for your service.

@SenSchumer What r u afraid of Chuckie?https://twitter.com/zakwhgov/status/838610061266206720 …
@SenSchumer OMG anyone who thinks their stuff hasn't been sold 20 times over by now w/FB, Twitter, Google u live under a rock!
you agree to that when you use it. This is your internet provider using/selling your info. W/o consent.
Schumer is determined to do anything against whatever Repub. do. He's a said case of leadership and bi-partisanship
If you are concerned about privacy how about getting rid of the Patriot Act.  Scrub the NSA.
@SenSchumer no way should they be allowed to have anything
Actually no.  The rule did little to protect privacy anyway.
Thank you for supporting privacy
@SenSchumer Schumer is a joke. You now know why nothing can get done in Congress. Democrats are crybabies. Do nothing. Complain
We need this during the campaign for the presidency.
@SenSchumer 6 million lost health ins. W/ ACA these are working people so Schumer illegals friends including criminals have ins.
How is Trump collecting bids on wall that is NEVER going to get built
This will bring us off our couches
#Believeme
Do u support giving @SenSchumer  pampers  so he can wear them
I support giving them to big baby Trump, who can't read and comprehend more than 140 chracters.
@SenSchumer the worst sentor ever
@SenSchumer you should be our senator ur too old and if not for NYC u wouldn't be
@SenSchumer please get the justice confirm or  someone going to be without a job
@SenSchumer Donny changed this law so HE could track everyone ! full stop
@SenSchumer The internet was secure till Obama gave himself the right to play god with it! Look it up...he wanted total control
@SenSchumer Protect r privacy U hypocrite U allowed obama to open 16 spy agencies upon us & never said a word BIG HYPOCRITE
@SenSchumer Empty words from a dinosaur that knows he is connected to Obamas spy network!
What Consumer Web Privacy? The NSA & FBI sweeps Us up then Criminally leaks & Unmasks US!
@RepTenney @SenGillibrand It's bad enough we're plagued with telemarketers now, sell our info and it gets much worse
Who do you think signed the bill to make that possible?! Obama and Sumer!
@SenSchumer I hope Democrats dont make the Hillary mistake of thinking Trump backlash is all you need, no, we STILL want change
This is urgent matter!
@SenSchumer  hey Congress, pretty please, side with people this time?
They sold internet to Radical Islam! They are responsible for spying on us. Snowden called it!
.@SenSchumer Thank you, Sen. Schumer.
@SenSchumer totally agree  internet should be protected.
It was protected. Schemer and Obama sold internet to radical Islam and are trying to cover their tracks!
Thank you, Senator Schumer!
@SenSchumer There should be no questioning this !! Why is this up for vote?! The Right To Privacy is critical to us! #VoteHellNo!
don't listen to Schumer it's another lie.  HIPPA protects us all. Wow Schumer your a,weak person
