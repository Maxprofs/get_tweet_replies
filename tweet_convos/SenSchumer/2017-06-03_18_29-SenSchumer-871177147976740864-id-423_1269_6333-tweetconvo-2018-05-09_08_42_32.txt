Schumer all you guys need to quit blocking trump on things and start working with him so things like that don't happen here in the USA
Schumer open your crying eyes & wipe it to see reality of your wrong political philosophy. Pres Trump is always right. He will MAGA
Wow i read through this timeline on this tweet Senator I am deeply sorry for all these hateful ignorant tweets
I bet dollars to donuts ur not tweeting from Aleppo or Falujah. Visit for a week let us know how it is in the real world
You are not in the real world
No terrorism exists dont kid your self
gop nazi terrorism does indeed exist
We should never apply a knee jerk reaction of hate to any situation but instead conduct a thorough evaluation
try to walk the streets of a ME warzone without automatic weapons and an armored convoy, then come back lecture us about "hate" you reject
i am still strong enough to reject it
Strong enough???? Just pray to God that non of your family members have to face this type of terror. You're not strong you're plain stupid!
You are reported
At a time when people have lost their loved ones we need time to mourn Prayer is part of that process for some
Sont forget we need to cuddle with them and buy them puppies. Terrorists luv puppies
No puppies
Thank you Senator for your strength and wisdom
What strength & wisdom/ he only prove he is fake/ clueless poor substitute for a human being/ most legal are jack asses
This is my senator and I do not care for your lack of respect
