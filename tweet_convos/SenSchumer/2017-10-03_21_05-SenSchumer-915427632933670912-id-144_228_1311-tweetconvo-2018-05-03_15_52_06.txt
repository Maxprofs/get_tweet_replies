Love you Senator but HATE Yankees.  Go Red Sox!
@SenSchumer We need a bipartisan effort on gun reform, work done up rescue CHIP, and more (& faster) aid to PR. Maybe work on that instead?
*done to, auto correct
Get to work bum. No wonder Puerto Rico was going bankrupt, you were watching sports. Congress is worthless.
Thx chuckles
And America is still losing. Do your job and kick this ass out of the white house
Awwww chucky....I want to see them play the Indians
Considering the NYY hadn't been there since 2012, I'm glad they won too. Now, let's see if they choke or go forward at full speed.

ok I guess, though I’m more of a #NYMets gal
DEMS KEEP LOSING!!!! YES!!
You are a loser Schumer
Yes
Really. No one wins during the time for mourning. Grow up
Chuck, this is something you will never experience "WINNING ". Resistance is not winning, it's losing. The players work together, not apart
That’s the only good thing that come out of your mouth in years
I’ll take that as long as the Libtards keep losing.
Boo!! Just another thing we disagree on!
Time to Vote Schumer, and his kind out
OUR SYSTEM IS BROKEN
THEY BROKE IT
We can fix it
WE NEED AMERICANS NOT POLITICIANS
God Bless America

CHUCK, you have time for a game? Why aren't you working like POTUS

Chuck focus on real issues.  #heathcare #deficit #jobs and perhaps your #resignation. That would be cause for celebration
Anything but you doing your job .
Time to start hating on conservatives Chuck. Oh yea..Russia/collusion/not fast enough/poor judgement. Now it’s guns, how pathetic you are
First true thing you’ve ever said
THEY’E NOT DONE YET!
We need more guns because of hatefilled swamp creatures like Chuck Schumer.
No body cares.
Another talking point. The world is tired of your lying bullshit.

A team working toward a common goal. Just like Congress, right?
You can say that again ...

Fucking insanity. His true colors have been known, though. But congress can do something about this. Will they is the question.

Never any doubt in my mind (Don't tell Amy and Al I said that please)
Why don't health insurers combine group and individual market insurance pools?
Because SCHUMER IS OWNED BY PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES/LOBBYIS
