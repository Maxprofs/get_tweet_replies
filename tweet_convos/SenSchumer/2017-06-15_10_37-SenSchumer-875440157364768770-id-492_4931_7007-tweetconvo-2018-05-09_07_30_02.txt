well you did destroyed sense8 why should i care ?
Wow! Hold on! Ur saying that because Netflix stopped providing a tv show, that u should not give a shit about preserving the open internet?
okay tbh i'm not native english and doesn't know what that mean. Just manifesting my anger here
Wait... They cancelled Sense8? Without finishing the story? Hold up #Netflix ! Is this true?
You understand the bigger issue here right?
James this comments are cancer! Human rights are more important than a TV show!!!
Wow! I didn't see the comments until you mentioned it....these people are mental. They don't understand what net neutrality is apparently.
Well at least the word is getting out .
Also I've heard that show is getting finished so Idk what the big deal is.
It is finished, that's why they keep talking about it. Even after the director (I think) said it had too small of an audience.
Probably an error when they were calculating the grow proyection. you can't never know if and when a show can hit.
25 years and my life is still #sense8 #BringbackSense8 #UnitedForSense8 #WeAreTheGlobalCluster
Trying to get that great big hill of hope #WeAreTheGlobalCluster
Everyone deserves better.  Everyone deserves Sense8  #BringbackSense8 #NoSense8NoNetflix
I don't think you understand. If the open internet is not preserved, you might not be able to afford to watch @netflix
.@netflix became successful due to #NetNeautrality
Yaaaaas open internet!!!!! Preach!!!!!!
I put my info in this better not happen...wait why would the FCC do something like this? You know if they do there will be back lash with the entire country
@ButtBoob seriously tho how many times for how many years is this going to b an issue?
 Netflix is having problems since 01:00 PM AEST  https://aussieservicedown.com/status/netflix?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=TweetReply … RT if also affected! #NetflixDown
You know what else we deserve? Season 3 of Sense8. #UnitedForSense8
Holy shit, I hope you understand the bigger issue here.
How can I get a Netflix US account, while living in the Netherlands?

Pay more attention to sense 8 fans!!!! #BringbackSense8 #Sense8Amazon #Sense8Amazon #Sense8FYC
If you're so concerned about neutrality, screen #TheRedPill
Just stop! Netflix is trying to save the internet and y'all crying about Sense8. Hush. Y'all do know this is way more important than a show?
Yes it is important. Kill net neutrality. Boycott Netflix.
@netflix #Sense8AppreciationDay and so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
You better stop blocking people using VPN for internal home network stuff first, before start talking about #NetNeutrality 
@waddupxanax There is more to an open internet than title II - we need legislation
You're hillarious. Tell me more how you paid attention to the #Sense8 fans desperate pleas????
Our govt is threatening our right to an open Internet & all y'all care about is Sense8. This is why we're in the position we're in today.
How is it I'm just hearing about all this...
I have no idea why Twitter added you to my Netflix reply btw. Weird.
How can I trust that U R in this fight 4 the right reasons? U about $$ these days right? Practice what U preach and open the rights 2 Sense8
U understand the bigger issue here right?
Yep. We all should be fighting for net neutrality. My comment though is about whether we have trustworthy ally in Netflix. Maybe/Maybe not
Aren't you that company with self-updating servers installed within the datacentres of ISPs in order to quickly deliver content?
What about the fight for sense8?
When you got BitTorrent, PornHub, Netflix and Amazon on the same side something is up for real.
It's actually funny because Netflix just joined anti-piracy organization ACE to, you guessed it, undermine the open and free internet
You can oppose piracy (as a company) and still support net neutrality, in regards to treating all web traffic equally
Everyone also deserved sense8. That didn't matter to you
The preservation of the open internet is a lot more important then the running of a tv show.
I was not talking to you
you were quoted by @voxdotcom
Just as we will never outgrow the fight to #BringbackSense8 I'm for #NetNeutrality but Sense8 deserves a couple more seasons. #RenewSense8
An open Internet is a fundamental right deserving full protection of the Constitution http://internetfreedomamendment.org/petition 
It's refreshing to see you standing up for standing. How I wish you would stand up for sense8 next. #AGirlCanDream
*something 
OMG @netflix has ruined my rep 
This is what we call loyalty by the way. AKA PROMOTION #WeAreTheGlobalCluster
So why is it that I can only watch half of the content for more € here in the Netherlands?
Pointless government regulation for the win!

In other contexts, your lobbying government for special privileges would be rightly condemned.
I think we need to put our sense8 related things against a red poster in white. Any volunteers???
why should I care about what you want... when you don't are about what we want? #BringbackSense8 #WeAreTheGlobalCluster #Sense8
This isn't about what Netflix wants, everyone should want this. Go cry about your TV show some more but this is actually important.
Sad people don't get the picture here and are too worried about a dumb tv show.
I really support this cause, but we're still going to need you to bring back Sense8. #WeAreTheGlobalCluster #UnitedforSense8
They should release the rights and allow them to find another platform which is a big part of Internet freedom. We will watch it anywhere.
Really... Like really...  Stop ignoring everything about Sense 8...
Fuck sense 8 Net Neutrality is more important than a goddamn tv show
Glad to hear this. Love my netflix account, keep fighting the fight for net neutrality
#BringbackSense8
Yes we also should have the same Netflix shows on both sides of the pond.  #noboarders
We deserve a closure!! Justice for Sense8

There is a bigger issue here.
I'm surprised @Netflix even has the capability or audacity to fight for anything, last time I checked u gave up on @sense8 grow some balls!
God dammit, was hoping for a discussion about #NetNeutrality but all I see is retards whining about Sense8. ffs
Not sure that's the message I got from listening to #reed hastings' interview at Code Conference...
URGENT: BRING BACK SENSE 8
If all what people care about is sense 8 then maybe these people don't deserve net neutrality
What do we have to do to join the Internet-Wide Day of Action?
Time to.cancel my Netflix account
Congress intentionally kept its hands off the internet for decades...now you want government control introduced. Terrible idea.
Net Neutrality is Newspeak for government control of the internet!
net neutrality = net censorship period I heard the interview w Google head w/Neal Cavuto @foxnews why I dropped google now Netflix
The only question in my mind now is:
- How open Internet can profit to companies like Netflix so much that they care posting about it?
Mmmmm
so put it on planes
if y'all can change ur mind about #NetNeutrality y'all can change ur mind to #BringBackSense8
However, several companies in Peru include Netflix with Twitter, FB, YouTube, etc. as special services.
we also deserves sense8 s3
And we will never outgrow the fight to #bringbacksense8
Everyone also deserves closure on #Sense8. #WeAreTheGlobalCluster
#UnitedForSense8
Everyone deserves the shows they LOVE Globally  #halfmillionbehindsense8
Keep fighting!
That reminds me to get a new pair of flip-flops.
This is an important fight. But how about you #RenewSense8 ? #halfmillionbehindsense8
And Everyone deserves a closure  #WeAreTheGlobalCluster
Give me a real postcode and I'll sign for ya.
All this sense8 talk and I'm just trying to find out when star ratings are coming back.
I hope to all that is good in the world, that you people are joking about that goddamn show
If you are not freaking out about #Sense8 right now, you're not paying attention!
Anyway, congrats for struggling 'bout Net Neutraly...
Neutrality*
I know that sucks but #BringBackSense8
It could seem childlike but this is what we can do. Like @netflix too mutch however... you know...

Put back on Sense 8 you'll have 502k people on your side.#halfmillionbehindsense8
It's now 507,707!
I can't believe these morons complaining about Sense 8 when this issue is so much more important. Unbelievably petty.
#Sense8  fandom will never outgrow fighting to bring back #Sense8 #halfmillionbehindsense8
As much as I like watching Netflix, I agree with you 1 million percent.
I've been a customer of Netflix since day one... Day F'in one... And now you spit in my face about Net Neutrality and how it won't affect U
Yet you want DRM in the W3C, seems a bit bipolar. I'll retweet anyway because I'm for #NetNeutrality
The internet is open...
And representation? #BringbackSense8
#WeAreTheGlobalCluster #BringBackSense8 #UnitedForSense8
your Tweet was quoted by @VentureBeat
SO happy to see you support Scientifically demonstrated lefty political views & to use subscriber $ to produce lefty Dem shows (eg Dr Nye's)
With the terrible decisions (eg: canceling well performing groundbreaking series) and idiotic comments Hastings made when r u firing him?
I think I stand with everyone when I say #FuckSense8 
Folks it's been said it was too expensive too produce.
'Never outgrow' why the change of heart?  It must me a money  thing.  #NetNeutrality for all!
And we will never outgrow the fight to #bringbacksense8
Came in here to see if people still complain about sense 8 and I am not shocked about stupid People crying about this show
the get down!! needs some justice too!!
Ironic...coming from netflix. But idc i'll sign
Netflix isn't perfect. But this makes sense after they had to pay an undisclosed amount to @comcast to keep customers speeds in place.
God forbid the day comes where ISP's want Google to pay for YT speeds. Maybe that actually is better and means we'll get more Google Fiber.
Agreed.
#RenewSense8    rihg now
Do people actually know what this is for instead of being delusional for some show people did not watch to warrant any more
Okay but do people understand what Net Neutrality is? This topic is way more important than just a show or etc. This affects everyone
Important to pay attention to this. @Thom_Hartmann on @freespeechtv bringing this issue up.
You know I think I need to get me some Netflix.. just saying...Frankie & Grace! I know I know you say it the other way, I'm a Frankie Fan!
#NoSense8NoNetflix
Why should we join another protest when you are ignoring a protest against sth you did. Hypocrites #UnitedForSense8 #WeAreTheGlobalCluster
I agree with you on this but not on the cancellation of sense8 #WeAreTheGlobalCluster
#BringbackSense8 #UnitedForSense8
#NetNeutrality does not equal "open internet", maybe y'all should read more and watch less @netflix
So, you got the deals you want, huh Reed, too bad about rights of all the peasants isn't it. Apparently money does corrupt you.
Oh good, I guess I can go ahead and un-cancel my account since y'all are back to defending #NetNeutrality
@netflix @reedhastings glad to hear you are still on the right side of history in terms of #netneutrality. This isn't only about profit.
We help you and you help us #BringBackSense8
I'm glad to hear it. Net neutrality should be everyone's concern.
#JusticeForSense8 #wearetheglobalcluster #BringbackSense8. Thank you!
I guess you only reason you care is because probably 99% chance NFLX out of business a year after netneutrality. But welcome to the fight.
Don't ever forget your roots #Netflix #NetNeutrality
Everyone deserves to #bringBackSense8

Instead of cancelling something without a reason  and then be selfish by not letting others buy the rights to prove you wete wrong
Instead of net neutrality you should give the rights of the series to the producers.  So they can continue their work
we want a new season about sense8 ! #RenewSense8 #BringbackSense8 #Sense8 #WeAreTheGlobalCluster
Net neutrality rules have become less important to Netflix because "we're big enough to get the deals we want"
Netflix CEO Reed Hastings
Can everyone shut up about Sense8? Net neutrality is so much more important than some show that got canceled. Get some fucking perspective!
One is a good show and the other is an insidious change to the fundamental control over the internet. Like I said, get some perspective
Thumbs up!!!!!!!!!! Way to go for future
Thank you. And I'll keep my Netflix account going!
What changed your mind? I thought you said that you were too big and powerful to be affected, so screw everyone else.
They're never take us alive! Freedom!
Sell the rights 
#WeAreTheGlobalCluster
Happy, but skeptical about this. Earning people's trust back is going to take a damn lot of goodwill.
What about @sense8 , huh? We are 500k ++ and we want the show back! Hear our roar! #UnitedForSense8
#Bringbacksense8
So I take it Comcast isn't giving you enough hush money now?
A free & open internet is more important than one TV show. This could mean the end of the WWW as we know it. #NoHyperbole
Agreed on net neutrality; however that is irrelevant to why I'm here. Be free and open with @sense8 , @netflix . 
#WeAreTheGlobalCluster
they are also fucking us on the damn data cap.   I get close everymonth and even went over a few times. I like streaming netflix in HD.
#GoFCCYourself
I thought you didn't care about net neutrality ? What changed ?
Can't agree here. That's why you partner with Deutsche Telekom in their “StreamOn” Package. Totally against #NetNeutrality
you were quoted by @newscomauHQ
Nothing will get better as long as we have monopolies in the internet access market? We need wireless 5g for home internet and true compet
URGENT: Renew Sense8 or sell it to a better company @hulu @HBO #NoSense8NoNetflix #WeAreTheGlobalCluster
I don't give a flying fuck. Either bring back Sense8 or give the rights back to the Wachowski's. #fucknetflix
Glad Netflix did this because I was about to cancel my service when Netflix's CEO said they no longer give a damn.
What's net neutrality
Net neutrality....a show. Hmmm
ya but the Internet and world deserve @sense8 so get on that too kthx

glad to see that netflix made the decision to return to this fight.
#BringbackSense8
Where's the hustle? Sure you'll never outgrow net neutrality with that attitude
I swear to fuck, 99% of these commenters are retarded. Without net neutrality, they'll likely never get a chance to watch it even if sense8
came back as ISPs will throttle the fuck out of it and charge extra  for data overages. This post is not the place to get
recognized for your  allegience to a single fucking show!
about time you join back in the fight.
And Sense8?
Gimme the stars back, then we'll talk
Why do i give a shit when i can't watch Netflix right now #down
#BringbackSense8 and fight for #NetNeutrality . that is being on the right side of history.
I'm pretty sure your CEO is on record saying Netflix has outgrown fighting for this. Has that changed?
We want sense8, see our noise netflix!! #UnitedForSense8 #WeAreTheGlobalCluster #BringbackSense8
Um I think your still not paying attention right now. I don't even know sense8. Bigger picture here 
@AshleyBoasso fighting for open Internet, only in America...
Well not exactly, right? 
SMDH.
#BringBackSense8 #WeAreTheGlobalCluster
I hope providers start restricting access to Netflix. Karma! #BringbackSense8 #WeAreTheGlobalCluster #NoSense8NoNetflix
Fight for #NetNeutraliy
well you get profits here as well
@stuckinaHAYES
good move. *renews subscription
#NetNeutrality is one of the most important issues and should be fought for!  So is #Sense8 and we're still here! #WeAreTheGlobalCluster
As a sens8 fan, all the other fans on this thread make me want to punch them. Priorities people.
Will you be giving out credit to your paying customers for lack of service on this date?a slow down means lower quality then what I pay for
Thank you so much for joining the fight! It means the world to all of us. <3
I don't think people ACTUALLY understand the real problem here... Sad times.
Indeed.

You should have never given up on Sense8. The fans deserve better.
Netflix wants to destroy fantastic series, do not let them. If you're not freaking out about sudden cancelations, you're not payin attention
#sense8forever #UnitedForSense8 #BringbackSense8  #renewsense8
Where is sense8?
We'll be holding you to this. Do not disappoint your customers.
You only care about money, btw.
Don't bring up this when you are denying to release the rights of Sense8
