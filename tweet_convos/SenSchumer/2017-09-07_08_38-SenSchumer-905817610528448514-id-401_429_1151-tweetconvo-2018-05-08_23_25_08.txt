homeless legal american veterans????
If DACA is allowed 2 stay, only a matter of time B4 those people vote 2 give amnesty 2 their parents & open border to all.  No more Daca!
Ok so then just give us a work permit, one we can renew every lets say 5 years. If you commit a crime revoke it and don't give us a vote.
Well B4 your time , Regan gave amnesty to 3M illegals.  Now we deal w/36M.  Making deals is taken as a sign of weakness, then more abuse.
Nobody is saying that but the DACA recipients are here to contribute to this country the only country they have known.
We can't allow illegal immigration under any circumstances.  Laws must stand 4 all.  W/O law, we R Juarez, uncivilized.  Blame your folks.
So it's my parents fault for wanting the same thing your ancestors wanted right an opportunity at a better life. Hypocrite..
Everybody wants the American dream.  More reason to protect what we have built.  I've paid taxes for 55 yrs.  Your parents, squatted & hid.
So that's what my parents did I don't see what that has to do with me?
They should come after veterans and Americans! Shame on you
Thank YOU!!! 
No amnesty and we want the wall this can't be any clearer stop all this bologna read the writing on the wall

Watch Schumer Vs Schumer - The Greatest Flip Flop Ever On DACA: http://710wor.iheart.com/featured/mark-simone/content/2017-09-12-watch-schumer-vs-schumer-the-greatest-flip-flop-ever-on-daca/#ixzz4sUrhme1x …
homeless legal americans????

Qe need to end his career of lies and get him home
Why havent they tried to become American Citizens legally, they've had plenty of time, as have you to do something!!
an we the people will not rest until they are all out
In their heart's?Are you joking?I'm rich in my heart go fight and make it my reality you Puppet

CHUCK SCHUMER

Says ending #DACA is heartless…
Now Dems don't just want 'legal', it's easy path to citizenship & votes. Give them American jobs too. Stand with Dreamers, walk on Americans
Maybe if you actually worked a day in your life in this economy then big endorsements from book publishers you would know the struggle.
This Chuck is the truth !

HYPOCRITE!

Chuck, just like your 2009 speach were you state you are against ileagals and an amnesty.
Such hypocrisy by you and your Democrat colleagues
Chucky lets keep it real u will fight 4 them 4 the future votes 4 Demoncrats! thats all Did u fight 4 themwhen  https://youtu.be/QKzav3XDBxo 
Yes they should.
REALLY? So you stand with me & my DREAM?
Obviously you're with dreamers....you ran Hillary for President!  Nightmare avoided!
You also stand with Menendez by your comment.
"We all believe in the presumption of innocence..."
Except regarding President Trump, that is.
all about votes uh chuckie we all have you number
they are simply illegal.
So were you lying then or are you lying now Chuck?
As you step on the lives of those who are here legally and the American citizens who are footing the bill.
Why the change of heart? Oh ya, because it's @realDonaldTrump 
Damn hypocrite
Anti DACA Schumer

Vs…
Then why do they denounce America? And wave the Mexican flag?#anything for votes
U make it sound like come over illegally.It's a free country 4 those who are cunning enough to abuse the law.Disappointing
I came here legally paid dues. I have a permanent residency have to save up for naturalization. Will u reward me for abiding the law?Refund!
My ancestors required a Constitutional amendment to attain citizenship you traitor.
You wouldn't be re-elected if we stopped illegals from voting!  That's all you care about.  STOP DACA!
Hillary agrees
WATCH: Hillary Saying in '09 that DACA Children should not be allowed to stay in America. 

But I don't remember the MSM calling her racist.

Most #DREAMers are in their mid 20s, which means they had 20+ years to come up with the $680 it takes to become a citizen.
I'd say dump the government completely we the people have the power they work for us right Chuckie, first one I've start with Chuckie gone.
Chuck is a dreamer himself he cares more about the Mexicans then he does his own American peps we call that a hypocrite not happening Chuck.
I told you Chuckie it's never going to happen you think it just has to go through the Senate and the house we the people will vote it down.
#NODACA,  SEND back,  give American KIDS free stuff
The Americans are sick of u & dems fighting tooth & nail against us,, dreamers must go back & do it the legal way, without 1 penny from usa
Quit calling them DREAMERS, it's just a Publicty gag
Sure, you liar! Which Chuck is the real Chuck? You don't care a thing about "dreamers" only votes!
Yep, a real sleaze ball.
https://twitter.com/PatriotMommaC/status/906178313894469632 …
#1 reason why you don't want to deal with it is because your donor's don't want it
Do your damn job Chuckie
Well get on it , now.
WHAT ABOUT THE DREAMERS THAT ARE WAITING IN LINE TO GET HERE LEGALLY, & CANT CAUSE WE ARE SATURATED WITH YOUR BELOVED LAW BREAKERS?
I know how this feels it is a costly and long wait. Then we get here and start working we pay for our insurance and theirs. It's a dream!
I AM ALSO A LEGAL IMMIGRANT, WHEN I BECAME A CITIZEN IT WAS THE PROUDEST DAY IN MY LIFE. HOW CAN ANYONE WHO SNEAKS IN EVER FEEL PRIDE?
The way I see it is that their parents never cared about their future, they want them to live in the shadows. If Obama never signed #DACA
Nancy & Chuck have been lawmakers 30/18 yrs. U could have called illegals out of the dark; helped w/$ to apply. Be creative/Trump will helpU
Tell me, then why they haven't applied for citizenship?
Then why haven't you done something! Glad you finally xescided to follow a real leaders (Trump) direction. Now follow him on tax cuts


#draintheswamp of these flip flop appointed ppl
WHAT ABOUT THE FURTURE OF THE [NEW] DREAMERS [THIS PROGRAM SHOULD END] OR WILL THERE BE OPEN BOARDERS FOR ALL THE WORLD TO COME TO AMERICA??
Resign!  You were elected to represent AMERICAN CITIZENS! #law breaker
Do you live with them?

Middle classR suffering..income inquality, student loans..just 2name few..yet u spent ur time complaining& defending illigals on our dime!!
You were elected to represent #AmericanCitizens. Do your job and start supporting our LAWS, not breaking them. #DeportThemAll

.@SenSchumer vs. .@SenSchumer the next time someone says .@realDonaldTrump is racist show them this 
Chuck, it's on you & congress to fix this now.  DACA was going to lose the lawsuit & you know it.  Trump gave 6 months to fix it, so fix it.
Flip-flop much?
https://youtu.be/eeDdE8Qb_sM 

Fake tears.
Regressive Schumer.
Tell him he's dreamin'
Your like a broken record chuck! Shut your mouth& fix the dam law in the next 6 mths & prob.goes away. Do you do any work at all!!!
Get busy with a bill
Like the ones who were waving Mexican flags at the demonstrations?
@realDonaldTrump @GOP @seanhannity @FoxNews Anyone compromising laws is called criminal..law makers compromising laws should be impeached!
Sen Schumer, Who are you?
Democrats are Schizophrenic
Pass the #dreamact. Thanks. 
Hypocrites
Good! Thank you. Let's make it happen!
They need to go through the proper channels to become citizens.
I stand with the American children
so pass a law instead of unconstitutional DACA!!
If the dreamers love this country why didn't they apply for citizenship when they became of age. They new this was not a forever thing.
Well, what have you been doing?
After eight years congress is  finally going to go to work on immigration? LOSERS DISAPPOINTMENTS
Obama’s DACA program was a clear abuse of executive power.
Don't blame Trump
Blame Obama, he knows he was wrong
Maybe they should wave the American flag then and not the Mexican one.
Legally...
stand not really, you usually just bend over and say may I have another Bernie, saw u in guinness bk of WR as the largest anal pin cushion
Talk is cheap just do it already
I stand for the laws The constitution & citizens of this nation! Now it is up to congress to fix the reason we now have anchor babies & them
Yeah, should have done this a long time ago. Thanks for waiting till the last minute. Everyone sees congress as a joke, just fyi
All I hear & feel from democrats is we as American citizens should except the failure of the past POTUS & Congress to remove these people
I stand with americans
you watched these kids parents say we are coming - we are staying- and there's not a God damn thing you can do to stop us-

Must be, say, 2 million "Americans in their hearts ". In line. Nobody likes the line cutter. Nobody.
Then move to Mexico!
Ummm...they can. Ask any Legal Immigrant how They did it. There's like..a whole program for that. I honestly do NOT understand. Do the work!
Help our @POTUS  come up with an amazing bill that is what our nation stands for & honors our laws & our potential..
You tweet more than POTUS you have a lot to say without really saying anything tick tock 6 mnths old Chuckie boy


not what you said in 2010 on CNN.
Sure do wish you cared about the American people as much as you do the dreamers it's sad that we the taxpayers play second fiddle to illegal
Awe thank you Senator, I dream of law abiding CITIZENS having a true voice, I dream my medical insurance will be less this year. Am I dreamr
Once you stood for the American people. You even said so yourself. Why have you abandoned us Chuck?

https://twitter.com/SLandinSoCal/status/905889433395765248 …
Please Senators,this must get done for these young people!Where are we as a nation of !Obama was right,it's all politics,and that is sad
That's is exactly what should have been done 8 years ago under President Obama.
Every #protest, #TrafficBlock, #Obstruction of #Commerce, Act of #Violence or Urban #Terrorism REDUCES public support for helping #illegals.
Please don't cry. Save it for the catastrophies going on around you.
#DREAMERS would look more like they hold America in their hearts if they would stop chanting " #NotMyPresident " & waving #Mexican Flags.
I am a billionaire in my heart.  Soooooo....  should the government arrange for me to be one?
You are an out right hypocrite
When was the last time this guy rooted for our kids? You vote for his comrade Gillibrand and your kids will starve in your basement
Some dreams are delusional
Stand with Americans
But it can't be kept up No more Dreamers We need to take care of our own
Yeah a whole bunch of DREAMERS are also American Born and in debt because they didn't get FREE EDUCATION AND FREE HEALTHCARE. CHUCKIE
keep your eye on Trump...he really can't be trusted on this
https://twitter.com/yournews101/status/905625053617942529 …
The #American people are not heartless, and neither is #POTUS.  We realize the plight of #Dreamers, and this will be addressed.  Respect us!
#Protesting in the streets is not the answer, Sen. Schumer.  This does not endear them to anyone.  They should allow #Congress time to act.
There may be a pathway to citizenship, but it must come with a #BorderWall and #ComprehensiveImmigrationReform, including the #RaiseAct.
If this is true, then why do they carry #Mexican flags when they #protest?  They must be willing to denounce #Mexico and embrace #America.
When will they embrace English as a first language? Spanish is so simple Why do we even teach in that language? For Dem votes
Under the #RaiseAct, all applicants must be able to speak the #English language.  This is a very small requirement, and is not unreasonable.

A lot of the "Child" refugees which head to UK are actually adults.
https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/723530/prove-child-migrants-refugees-adults-Home-Office-crisis/amp …


The majority of these so-called kids are 26 years and older considered adults
they are far from being American,how many fly our flag and sing our anthem?obey the law first then assimilate united
Not what you said back in 2012 Chuck.. maybe you should be careful what you say. You do realize that YouTube and social media is out there.
https://twitter.com/yournews101/status/905625053617942529 …. Yep
Exactly
What about American Citizen Dreamers? Why are you putting ILLEGAL ALIENS above and before the CITIZENS of this country? SHAME ON YOU DEMS!!!
Except, regardless, they and the people that brought them broke federal law. You should know this as a sitting Senator
They are NOT American's
DREAMERS FOR THESE SELFISH PEOPLE MEANS VOTES! ThATS all.I hope @POTUS gets full border fundg before approving 800,000 & mils VOTE FOR DEMs
why do they get a free pass when so many spent years and 10's of thousands to become citizens?  o thats right, you congress people are lazy.
you know what would be great,  you people in congress to streamline the citizenship process better.
Please don't trust the con man he will do anything to sneak back to power and he has most of the country against him.
Funny.

Americans are dreamers in their heart.
#daca is an unConstitutional nightmare
Let's see just how cruel some R can be.
U freaking hypocrite! Make up your mind! Disgusting. Take care of our own! https://www.westernjournalism.com/watch-it-only-takes-fox-news-lisa-boothe-3-words-to-put-obama-in-his-place/?utm_source=Email&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=dailyam&utm_content=western-journal …
Is this all you can focus your tiny mind on ?
They need to apply for citizenship.
INSTEAD of using our court system on wasteful law suits spend the money on helping DACA ON CITIZENSHIP!
Than do something you have had years to do it so what are you waiting for
good when they LEAVE GO WITH THEM!
I Stand with the citizen/taxpayers of the United States
DACA Illegals should go back where they came from, and start process legally, not given prefrence over people that come in FRONT Door
Quit lying Mr Schumer. If you were telling the truth the law would be written by now. Get to work before your next vacation.
When they've had a decade and haven't? They don't want to. Don't pay taxes and still get benefits of people that do ! Why would you? Dumass
You are smoking crack again chucky
POTUS made it happen for you and Congress to make it law, all u all have to do is get off ur butts and actually get to work Chuck
How about the millions of us who r really Americans chuckie u seem to always forget about us until election time America time 2 forget HIM!
Constant position change or tantrums?
Guess You and Congress should have done something about that during past 8 years.  It is your job!
#BuildtheDamnWall #NoAmnesty #NoDACA #NoFreeTuitions #FastTrack #LegalImmigration #Assimilate
Illegals who broke the law come before American citizens bring on 2018 but resting well screwing Americans on unaffordable healthcare ?
then you stand not with the Constitution.
Now DACA is your #1 priority? was it #1 last yr? the yr before? Politicians up in arms over DACA are using it for political purposes only!
Some DACA are MA-13 gangs & criminal illegals! Others would be good citizens! They need to leave, get legal & become US citizens.
