Rose's husband Jose was deported to El Salvador, where he hasn't been in 17 years. #EndTheAssaultOnFamilies
"Why is my American Dream being crushed by my own government?" #EndTheAssaultOnFamilies
Oh shut up.  Your the endless parade of fake news.  A 14 yo was raped by immigrants, they don't parade her!
Yeah, and an American Marine was held a long time in Mexico prison for nothing & you were silent.  Americans first!!!!
Shame Schumer doesn't fight this hard for American citizens.
I think he does actually....
End the assault on breaking the law.
Does Fox ever say anything true?
Good riddance !!
@SenSchumer And why didnt he follow up on that a decade ago???
Cruel and insane action taken.  Trump MUST go!
Yes, any all means. Let's not enforce our laws.
what have i paid in this families expenses
@SenSchumer ..he violated the law & should have been deported several yrs ago..Schumer surrender to federal prison..
IF YOUR CLEAN FROM CRIME??  YOUR FINE!! JUST GET OFF FOOD STAMPS & WELFARE!!
How do you know they are on food stamps & welfare?did lying trump tell you that personally?
2/3 of the illegals are on food stamps/welfare!! STOP Criminal cities!!  ITS FRAUD!!!!  Illegal !!!
I wish he would try that with me.
Senator Schumer, can you help this family? His daughter and son need their daddy!    Thank you for your concern.
Don't know if you thought that was funny,I call it pathetic.
Donna, what were you referring to? What would I call funny and what would you call pathetic?
So why wasn't the paperwork fixed. Had 10 years.
@SenSchumer  Everyone assumes that they knew about the paperwork mistake and decided NOT to fix it. U people R Unbelievable!
No you people are unbelievable!  You're the pot calling the kettle there
I'm the pot calling the kettle black because U refuse to look at all scenarios? LOL.  Are U racist or ignorant?
Then why did he not rectify his paperwork?
well maybe if he had made the attempt to become legal this wouldn't have happened..oh yeah then he would have to pay taxes
@SenSchumer you sure loved Obama when he deported a lot of illegal immigrants
@SenSchumer another booooohoooooo!
@SenSchumer Guess you want to blame Trump for that?
Because YOU KNOW and WE KNOW that mistakes will happen. BUT YOU LOVE THOSE MISTAKES so you can CREATE FEAR!
WHY not post about the criminals who have done HEINOUS things that ICE IS NOW CATCHING AND REMOVING?
These law breakers using their children as sympathy pawns is sick, twisted and disgusting. Liberals are pathetic! #MAGA
Reap the benefits of America but take no responsibility!
THEY ALL LEAVE AND APPLY-MAYBE GET TO COME BACK.????
@SenSchumer chuck several thousand voters made a mistake and you're a senator!
FYI: San Diego news media reporting Trump will start wall construction along San Ysidro/Tiujana border (expect complex controversies)
@SenSchumer was he here legally? We are a country of laws! Remember?
@SenSchumer Really? "A paper mistake"? Children are dead because of a "paper mistake". Illegal immigrants need to be deported.
Mistakes happen Senator. It was no mistake when two illegals raped a 14 year old girl. You're in part responsible for this
-You should not have married or had children with an illegal...plain and simple...
@SenSchumer WHY DIDN'T U FIX IT THEN ??
Our nation is a melting pot of many citizens of those who arrived legally & not illegal. They can become citizens or have dual citizenship.
A paperwork mistake from a decade ago. That means someone thought they were doing there job.
@SenSchumer Probably forgot to dot an I. That's Adolph Trump!!
@SenSchumer Tell the whole story Chucky!
well well, and he has been illegally in USA for how long? This is silly.
@SenSchumer omg illegals getting detailed.. what craziness...
Chuck You!
That is LIFE!
@SenSchumer Obama mainly used limited gov resources to deport violent criminals, not longtime peaceful residents w American children.
so who made the mistake?
@SenSchumer a case of injustice. Mr Escobar was here on a stayed deportation decree. He was obeying rules & reporting to ice
A paperwork mistake from a decade ago led to Rose Escobar's husband #JoseEscobar being recently deported
What part of illegal don't you understand. We all welcome immigrants, but LEGALLY. You are costing Dems votes on 2018 giving GOP the 60.
Were all immigrants.I bet most of all our G.G.parents that came over were not legalized,I know mine wasn't.
According to gov. Statistics, 96.9% of immigrants entered US legally between 1891 and 1973. Laws must be obeyed or we are done as a Republic
@SenSchumer They it will get resolved. How many were legit deportations?
Heard you berated a couple having dinner last night because they voted for Trump Chucky #StayClassy #SwampMinion
Thin skin lying trump tell you that?
Schumer says "mistake"? Really? Someone forgot to put "IL" in front of "Legal" when doing the paperwork! Probably another Illegal.
And paperwork mistake? Proof not just talk
Im sure once its straightened out he will return. But glad to know Immigration is hard at work looking for illegals.
@SenSchumer If you're illegal you should be deported.
@SenSchumer A paperwork error as in "ran or swam across the border entering USA illegally"?
Chucky crying?
@SenSchumer this doesn't make defiance of your president right!
@SenSchumer  well if it's a mistake then we can fix it!
@SenSchumer real Americans don't care
@SenSchumer 
When will you do YOUR job and serve the American people?  You fight everything that's benefits America.
@SenSchumer Give it a break. Illegal is illegal. Comply or face the consequences. What part do you need clarified?
Paperwork mistake? As in he didn't file? My wife filled out all the paperwork & submitted it correctly. She didn't get deported.
unless she's a naturalized citizen, she is still not immune.
As I said, she filled it out and did it right. She is now a citizen.
there is a 2 step process, first permanent residency, and then citizenship, which is why I mentioned that. Good for her.
10yrs ago he was set 4 deportation, but he took off. His mother never filed the paperwork for him. ICE is doing their job
@SenSchumer Yet no mention of 14 year old girl raped by illegal immigrants? Sad
@SenSchumer - More lies , propaganda and deceit ... Chuck has no conscience .. #SchumerCorruptPolitics
@SenSchumer That's one instance. How about giving the example about the illegal immigrant who raped American children ?
How about all the americans that rape & kill their children,sorry but bad guys all over the place
Get the hell out of my country!
Hey slick this isn't just your country
@SenSchumer If legal fine.  If illegal go out of US
@SenSchumer @NCLR should have learn English better
@SenSchumer And did nobody try to fix the mistake? Someone lazy or incompetence.
What about the asinine ignorance in Congress over the past forty years https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/historical/gands.pdf â€¦ Total debt 1975 was what???
@SenSchumer then they had a decade to fix it and failed to act. Who's fault is that?
@SenSchumer and you Sen Schumer can't fix a mistake????
@SenSchumer good riddance
@SenSchumer That meant the I migration policy should be fixed before mass deportations. Mistakes can and will happen.
- Our border is weak and exploited .. We need to send a message to the world #BuildTheWall
@SenSchumer a prime example of when the courts and judges should get involved, not the other way around.
Excuses, excuses- those pesky paperwork mistakes come back to haunt you
Isn't that what all those immigration lawyers are for?
@SenSchumer so he's been here 17 years illegally? How come?
@SenSchumer By paperwork mistake, do you mean, he didn't have any.
@SenSchumer whatever you knew you were illegal not US citizens responsibility to keep you here
sadly it's because his skin is brown. In Trumpland that means paperwork mistakes don't count for anything. Disgusting but true
