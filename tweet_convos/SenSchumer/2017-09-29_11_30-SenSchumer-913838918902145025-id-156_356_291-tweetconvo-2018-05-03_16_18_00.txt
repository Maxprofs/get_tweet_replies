That is because most people in this country pay nothing...don't pay nothing, don't get nothing.  Not supposed to be a backdoor welfare sys.
Every person who was in ICU in Puerto Rico DIED & Trump tweets insults from his golf club.  WHEN WILL YOU IMPEACH HIM?????

More lies by those who represent "America under Seige" broadcast by @OANN One America News. Tim Kane son is arrested as part of Antifa. BAD

Great News: Driving to DC with Trump bumper sticker & getting thumbs ups from other drivers.

#SaturdayMorning #SatChat 
And this surprises anyone
As always... Republican mentality! Trickle-down stupidity!
@SenateGOP Problem is spending, not taxes cuts. The Dems have never seen a tax they didn't like. Look at the deficit they created in 8yrs.

Yawn. This lie is decades old.  Blah blah blah. Democrats have been saying this forever!  And that's why you keep in losing elections.
You people are pathetic...
Horse puck
So Schumer and the nyt are all of a sudden credible???
does anyone in their right mind really expect anything differently... protect the swamp and #basketofcrooks
Its #FakeNews Dems are professional liars, nothing more. Trump has always been about cuts for mid class
@realDonaldTrump Look what I found #wikileaks! 25yrs & Dems still read your tax/economic advice to the ClintonAdmin https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/emailid/39125 …
Botbrain!  Follow your leader into disgrace!!
Doesn't take a brain scientist to figure that out since they now pay most of the taxes.  This tax bill is what America needs now. Support it
Fool
You probably pay no taxes now, so why are you against others getting a tax cut?
It's Time To End The Republican PARTY Forever. ...They Can't Win unless They Cheat And They Can't Govern Win They WIN. .What's The Point? ??
Lie
Of course it would why give a break to the hard working people that deserve it. We are the ones paying for private planes and golf trips.
Now that's what I'm talking about you got it right hit the nail on the head.
@SenateGOP Dems don't tell U that the top 1% R also small biz owners. Dems don't understand SubS corps! Dems put them out of biz w/ taxes!
Considering they pay 80% of the taxes, sounds like they're getting shortchanged.
I agree. We are lower middle class. It's not gonna do anything for us . I figured it on paper.
Rich Americans don't need a break. 45 brags he got sweet breaks cuz it's the law. Change the damn law to help the middle class who need it!
Phony Socialists, funny how you are RICH & we are not!  I thought you SHARE the wealth so where is your portion to the people?
The Socialist Dems have only increased taxes, so how did you all get wealthy??
And all your time in the Senate did you ever support a tax cut ?  Or restricting regulations that kill jobs.  Nope.  Didn't think so.

They also pay must of the taxes while the bottom 50% pay 0. You can’t cut a persons taxes if they don’t pay any
Do Liberals every stop LYING?
SO SAD
Wait, what, the NYTimes has ZERO credibility. Looks like a political hack job to me. NYTimes LIES!
I'm sick & tired of your identity politics, @SenSchumer and Democrats. It's not fair to make achievers pay so much more than everyone else.
It's the rich who built the factories & restaurants I worked in, who hire those who made my car, who donate selflessly to charity.
If we didn't have achievers in this country who strive to make life better for thousands, we'd be like Venezuela. They have big hearts.
VERY FAKE NEWS!!! Facts not fiction! Headlines are ludicrous and dishonest!!!
This bill scares dems because it takes money from them, irresponsible politicians with less of our money would be great
They pay 70%+ of taxes. You want more welfare for the 50% of wage earners that pay NO federal income taxes. Can you say Equal Protection?
Whom pay 38% of the total income tax in this country
You mean the people who open factories that employ hundreds of people?
Surprise, surprise -- more class warfare from the venerable New York Times.
We didnt need a study to tell us this. It was designed by a guy who puts his name on buildings in giant gold letters.
Giant step toward unrigging the economy.  Median income (50K or less) will keep 12K-24K more.  Plug loopholes like carried interest.  Jobs!
Where is your support for Doug Jones?
On television they say the tax cuts was bad cause the top one percent did not get a tax cut. One of you are way off.
This tax offer is terrible. Corporations-1% - Oligarchy are huge beneficiaries
Inheritance tax? 
Devil is in details.
Americans are angry
Of course! Benifitting the rich, was the plan all along! There is no "help the middle/low earners" plan. @potus plan suck!
What would tax allocations tables look like if  personal taxes were correlated to defense budget? The more you own the more you pay.

Let's see they get 50% but pay 70% of the taxes, what's the problem bozo
Another bill u didn't read? We get double standard deduction!
OMG.....SAME TAX ACROSS THE BOARD IS WHAT THE PUBLIC HAS BEEN ASKING FOR.  ALL YOU WORRIED ABOUT IS YOUR CUT.
Did the IRS earn their money or did they? Did you earn there $? Feds and welfare babies get not a dime of their $ when they move it overseas. You want a bite? Accept a nibble or it will be out of reach as trillions already are! welfare to work could save at least a few billion!
Hey Chuck, who are these children you dressed up for your play & where do they stay?  the island? @TGowdySC @wikileaks
And the NYT never gets it wrong?  Same old talking point Chuck, would you rather spend our money?  Get a real job, ye old senator.
#FakeNews Trump has NEVER been about tax cuts for the rich & chuck knows hes lying to you
@realDonaldTrump Look what I found #wikileaks! 25yrs & Dems still read your tax/economic advice to the ClintonAdmin https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/emailid/39125 …
SCIENCE!
How many times and ways are you going to say this and your wrong blah blah blah old Chuckie boy
Does that surprise you?
ITS #FakeNews Trump hasnt changed his views
@realDonaldTrump Look what I found #wikileaks! 25yrs & Dems still read your tax/economic advice to the ClintonAdmin https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/emailid/39125 …
You guys are threatened by the tax cuts for sure.
Okay, but do we really need new studies to show Republicans are greedy?
Lol omg can you be more backwards https://twitter.com/NeilMaginnis/status/899708584405200898 … Hey, ask HRC where the missing billions are from the state dept #Greedy
@realDonaldTrump Look what I found #wikileaks! 25yrs & Dems still read your tax/economic advice to the ClintonAdmin https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/emailid/39125 …
Chuck Schumer knows less about economics than Bernie Sanders.
.@SenSchumer -How does anyone know? Repub leaders don't even know the details! #nypoliticsFakeNews losing CREDIBILITY! Patience for facts.
But of course the slimeballs at NYT won't tell you that the top 50% of income earners already pay 97.2% of the taxes.

Have an easy fast...think about which list you + yours will be on when the Shofar Blows, Sir!
NYT  lies as much as the democrats.
KKK = Democrats treated the Blacks like crap for years.
The top 10% earners in American pay 40% of the taxes. Make US competitive with the rest of the world. 
Schumer SUCKS McCain SUCKS
Is there a single Democrats that dosen't lie???
That crazy. Democrats want to increase withholding from the hard working people.
Everything Trump has done is for the better of Amercans.
Please stop playing the income card. It proves that your voters are ignorant.
Make America great again
Wrong. Not sure what economics school you went too. Quit spinning this shit to your brain dead lemmings!
Every single American will benefit..accelerated economic growth, more jobs, higher pay.
You even retweet lies wonder why all ur elite 1% in the KKK democrat party r all silent when u attack them could it be ur r lying
https://twitter.com/mtmckissick53/status/913880039489523712 …
who pays the most in taxes?  you democrat party hacks have failed basic economics.
Ok, money makes the world go round, just like the wheels on the bus. Businesses create jobs, NOT Politicians.
Liberals keep saying that the top 1% don't pay any taxes, but always claim tax cuts will only help them.
So, if they don't pay any taxes, how would tax cuts help them?
This is why the Dems keep losing. You just crap stuff out of your mouths with no logic behind it.
"...new study finds" by Democratic funded group...
The NYT thinks they can lie and get away with it 
Suuuuuper fake news
What a surprise!
Those who benefit most from our economy, OWE the most to those who work here. Large dynastic wealth must be stopped with larger estate taxes
of course, who would expect anything else
10 Trillion in debt on your watch! Why should we believe you have  "Better Deal"for the American people?Resign from public life today.
I'm fine as long as you people in Washington are not getting it!
Surprise! Surprise!
WE THE PEOPLE, time to make a stand. We know the @GOP don't stand for us; we can reform our government if needed. FIGHT!!
You should be happy Chuck. It's going to you and your Buddies. How's Shelley doing
Liar
When it comes to the tax budget, it gives more to the rich, reduces  medicate by a large margin, And trump should know about taxes, because  we're still waiting to see his taxes!!!
STOP LYING TO YOU CONSTITUENTS CHUCH!!

HOPEFULLY THEY ARE SMART ENOUGH TO DO THEIR OWN RESEARCH AND SEE THAT YOU ARE LYING TO THEM!!
When it comes to the tax budget, it gives more to the rich, reduces medicate by a large margin, And trump should know about taxes, because we're still waiting to see his taxes!!!
take out ur last yrs taxes & calculate them w/new plan see how it wks as u make more than us "working class" obviously urs will be different
No read it for yourself people. Do not rely on Chuck. He is going to pay more.
30% of middle class will see increased taxes due to elimination of itemized deductions. INCREASED taxes.
This is what President; Trump is good for, and some on his   administration for contradictions! When It come to Puerto Rico! lies, lies!!
What else is new.
Why do you think we are all stupid, eliminate the loop holes and the ones you are talking abt would actually put out more money!
Under your plan we get nothing except  more taxes and more government control
I stopped as soon as I saw NY Times!  If liberals hate it then MAGA needs it!  We succeed then why do we need ANY liberals in our government
Put a massive tax on libs.
From the NYTimes, questionable?
Of course it will.
I don't mind the rich receiving a bigger share.  I will be pissed if the upper middle class is hosed to pay for tax breaks for rich.
Oh cool, so it’s like everything else
No, not at all like anything else. Is why dems are lyin n cryin Trump hasnt changed his views https://twitter.com/NeilMaginnis/status/899708584405200898 …
Knock it off and give us our tax cut
Who arethe OTHER half thatwould benefit? That's right, lower and middle class. EVERYBODY WINS!
No kidding.
Six figure tax cuts for the 1% and a couple of pizzas & a 6 pack on Saturday nights for the rest of us? Time for the 99% to just say NO!
Highest bidder. @GOP billionaire donors may have bought some senators & representatives but they sure as hell didn't buy the American people
They own companies, that would benefit the employees with more investment, raises in pay etc..
70% of taxes are payed by the top 10%
Top 10% pays 70% of fed taxes. Bottom 50% pays 0 fed taxes. Top 10% should get a bigger tax break. Y give people who pay nothing a break?
Gee, what a surprise!
Another lie. Cynical. Inaccurate. Scare tactic. Try being constructive. I'm middle class. Don't resist my tax cut
What study chucky the left wing antifa study on democratic rights?
Most Americans with the exception of Trump supporters believe this !
FAKE NEWS!!!!!
WaPo says 80% ?
Another neat trick the GOP does is tell black people the Democrats are causing their problems. The GOP does not care about the common man.
Was there any doubt?  These millionaires are not trying to help anybody but themselves then they insult us by saying we can buy a car for 1k
@SenSchumer DO NOT let the GOP remove the CBO scoring mandate as they want to do thru the budget resolution.
GOP leaders rich guys telling poor white people that people of color are the reason for their lower wages. Wake up GOP supporters
Really the  did they state that
So they will invest and make more jobs. Now tell us what %of saving will lower and mid class have. Stop focusing on rich you & focus on ppl!
did you know 70% of taxes are payed by the top 10%
Fake News!
Hopefully after Trump. GOP voters will realize they have been being lied to for years.
Wake up America our taxes aren't to make their life easier there to help the American people. Trump supporters need to wise up.
Libs will never understand economics or freedom. It's sad.
I'm a former Marine and I do pretty good for myself financially and I am a Democrat. And you're gullible Republican
Trump and his criminal administration will screw the American people. People in his cabinet are spending our tax money like it's free.
The middle class and the poor will be paying for all that lost revenue. But the trumps will be richer!
When the 1% gets all that tax money back who do you think will be paying those taxes to make up for the countries lost revenue.
Illegal immigrants since the dems say they are taxpayers too!
90% of the wealth to that select few.
Hello.
No surprise here.
Makes sense, since they have about that much of the nation's wealth already, no?
