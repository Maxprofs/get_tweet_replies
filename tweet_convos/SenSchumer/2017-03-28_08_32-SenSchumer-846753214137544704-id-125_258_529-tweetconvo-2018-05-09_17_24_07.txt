because Trump simply doesn't care.
Excellent question, Senator. Please keep asking them.
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez Cut the crap, become legal and shut up.
because they must be illegals. they can live together in their OWN country. not our problem
What about law abiding Americans that had their family members killed by illegals? They are FOREVER ripped apart!
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez if you don't care about the family's, how bout the $$$, to government to raise children w/o parent???
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez Come into my Country legally first!
Why do democrats break immigration laws by deliberately bringing in illegals to the U.S.?
Why did dems ignore law and let ILLEGALS in, in the first place. You KNEW this would happen. Shame on you and your lies.
Come to America legally and you won't have these issues!
Why is taking from the productive and giving it to the unproductive something to be proud of? No illegals
When U.S. lawbreakers get sent to prison, it also inconveniences their families. The way to avoid the problem, is do not break the law.
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez why is not enforcing our laws something you continue to do the ppl ask the public servants
WHEN YOU BREAK THE LAW THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES AND THEY ARE NOT OUR FAULT!
Why does the IRS rip apart families of people who cheat on their taxes?
THEY KNEW THE DAY WOULD COME TO BE SENT BACK-THEY SET THEIR CHILDREN UP FOR HIGH RISK.?NO TEARS AT ALL.??
why don't you ask the parents and spouses of the citizens that have died at the hands of illegals? You proud to defend their offenders?
STOP YOUR BULL PISS IF THE ILLEGALS WOULD HAVE STAYED IN THE COUNTRY THEY CAME FROM THEN IT WOULD NOT BE
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez come to this country legally, no problem. Come here illegally, your going back
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez Can't listen to your lies anymore. Not one DEM will admit that CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIENS are being deported
we have every right to have our laws! period! you break them you pay! STOP THE INVASION!
RIPPING APART FAMILIES? ROFL~! IF YOU DON":T WANT TO BE SEPARATED THEN DON:T COME HERE!
These law breakers using their children as sympathy pawns is sick, pathetic & disgusting. #MAGA
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez A bullshit argument. Then lets forget about sending anyone to prison. Prison tears families apart.
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez guess they shouldn't have come here "illegally", problem solved.
It's called LAWS, you know those pesky little things you pass & chose to ignore when applicable to an agenda
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez why is living here illegally something you are proud of? There are laws and you didn't follow them
Illegal immigrant does not equal immigrant
Doesn't Menendez have some young boys to molest in the DR?
When is Menendez scheduled for conviction? We wonder: In what prison will Menendez serve his term?
why is it that you are content harboring illegal people
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez why is taking my hard earned money out of my pocket when I speed on the roads something to be proud of.
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez actions have consequences, if you choose to be here illegally, there are consequences.
Don't rip them apart. Send them all back together.#problemSolving
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez he's enforcing the laws that are already on the books.  Dems only care for one reason only.  VOTES!
you should step down you clearly don't recognize United States Law.
WHAT PART OF THE WORD ILLEGAL DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND, stop shaming someone for upholding the laws that were in place.
As long as it doesn't effect his family he's good with it. Because they're all rapists,drug dealers, and murders.
menendez....right...that's funny....a more irrelevent servant can not be found..
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez why do we have laws and people that should In force them? A lawless country isn't a country! Get it? OMG!
Trumps tearing up families with his IMMIGRATION BAN.
constitution should be amended to not give citizenship to babies born in USA by illegals. Then no breaking up occurs
Are you proud of disregarding laws? Why don't you just write an unconstitutional law to fix this mess?
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez Question. Why are liberals happy protecting illegal criminals when they rape and murder Americans?
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez r laws
Someone comes to the USA ILLEGALLY, that's the risk the illegal alien takes... too bad.
so why r they ripped apart. if the r legal whats the problem. if not legal GEE could that be wrong?
@dramnabuttar @SenatorMenendez Rather to compel people to out from the country, legalize them to comply with UD of human right.
Illegal aliens don't count. Senator you represent citizens of this country. If you want to represent illegals, quit!
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez why isn't concerned about the safety of actual American citizens
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez Why don't you spend as much time - or some time - looking after the rights of those hurt by illegals here
Because he's a sociopath!
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez we live by the law. If you are not legal get out!
Family can go with him so he (ripped?) apart (overkill of words) again by crappy Democrat lover of law breakers
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez If you're illegal you should be deported.
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez Why are Americans second class citizens???
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez shit happens but being traitor to your President is worse
Cold, callous,  cruel, arrogant, misguided, not a true American at heart.  Many reasons...
Mexico is alot better. Spread the word.
Where is your outrage about Kate Steinle parents? Their daughter was murdered by an illegal they will NEVER see her again!
@SenatorMenendez, 14 counts or corruption? under investigation?  Hey @SenSchumer heard u went off lastnight?
Why is supporting and protecting law breakers something your proud of ? #KateSteingly
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez I have no sympathy for people who abuse our government. If you are illegal you will be deported.
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez - Why are not protecting citizens and supporting law breakers? The families can leave together ....
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez So braking the law something to be proud of I was taught to obey the law, ignorance of the law no excuse
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez Schumer, where was your anger when Obama was deporting? When Hillary wanted a structure built at border?
The answer, of course, is Yes.
We are not Proud of Sen Menendez who should RESIGN being Charged for Corruption & Bribery
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez - Chuck Hitler, what about Americans that are being ripped apart because they have no money ...
How many of u corrupt politicians  stood  with family of d girl that was raped by2 illegals in Maryland
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez Illegals out of US
Because he has no conscience, no morals, no sense, no self esteem, no values & the brains of a baboon.
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez  frustrating Chuck , you still don't get it. Break the law of the land and suffer the consequences.
don't forget he's a Democrat & they (Hillary) are above the law. It's for everyone else
If u followed laws familys would not be Ripped apart.
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez proud the law is finally being followed
@SenSchumer If I rob a bank to help my family they will rip my family apart to put me in Jail.  How is this any diff?
Because they are breaking laws of the USA.
The face of Americans being hurt by Trump
Only if you are against criminal illegals running free, want to vet before coming here
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez  he did not rip any family apart, not being legal does that. Own your mistakes..
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez If parents really care about their families, they wouldn't put their kids in this situation.
2nd/3rd generation imms supercharge our economy, science, military & cities! Truth is, w/out them we fall behind.
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez Obama deported 3x as many, didn't hear your cries then. Contact Hawaii with your concern for retrain ordr
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez Actually the parents are to blame for "ripping apart families."  We are a nation of laws. Come legally!
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez I liked to know the answer to that myself.
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez  families r separated when a parent convicted of a crime is hauled to jail. Where is outcry over that?
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez Golly Gosh! And the Republicans are such sanctimonious Christians. Don't they even care about results?
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez why do we not look at family when we send someone to jail because they broke the law
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez Because he should be proud of enforcing our laws.
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez isn't he focused on convicted felons and gang members? Why would you protect a child molester?
He is trying to #protectourchildren and keep anymore from getting raped, murdered, and assaulted
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez being a patriotic American who had no control over his birth
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez you're all just plain political games and you don't really care about us
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez why have the rule of law if you're not going to enforce it
that meaning Born into a Caucasian family
SHOULDN'T BE HERE ILLEGALLY!
