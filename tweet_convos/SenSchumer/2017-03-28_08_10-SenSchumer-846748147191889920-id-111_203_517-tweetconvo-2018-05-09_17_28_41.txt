TUNE IN at 11 AM when @NCLR, Sen. @KamalaHarris, @SenSchumer & I call on POTUS to #EndTheAssaultOnFamilies. https://www.facebook.com/senatormenendez  
@SenSchumer Progressives started this mess. Someone has to clean it up. You can't buy votes anymore. Your a safety hazard.
@SenSchumer When do American lives matter to democrats?  Our enemy has told us what he will do.  You just going to let them
Hell no
What law gives you the right to spend taxpayer money to spend on citizens of other nations? Taxes went sky high...
Illegals need to be deported! Stop calling them immigrants! They are not!
@SenSchumer ..Congress must uphold the laws & deport criminals..move the illegal criminals in your home..with your family
@SenSchumer what is wrong with Dems.,they support illegal aliens that have committed crimes, murder & rapes.
I'd they are here and their children are legal, then they need to go and the kids will be taken care off
@SenSchumer No, fund ICE to the fullest to protect law abiding American citizens. Stop protecting illegal criminals!!
maybe congress should be working with the prez instead of obstructing.  If your not in the game, don't complain
@SenSchumer What don't you understand about the word ILLEGAL??? You should be protecting us the legal Americans.
Wake up!!
@SenSchumer Hey if you are a illegal criminal we don't want them in our Country
Next thing Menendez wants is to defund the prosecutors who seek to convict him. Amazing!!
@SenSchumer yeah!! There must be a way of finding another task force that would make citizens pay 4 more shit. Make it so!!
Why don't you encourage them to become legal????
-Children if a minor should be deported with parents...can re-enter USA when they are 18.
America has laws!  If you don't follow those laws don't expect a free pass!!!
@SenSchumer People are suffering because your party allowed the laws to be broken over the years. Now it is Reps fault No
No they don't. For the first time in years it's money well spent.
Agree Chuck -- send the whole family back. Become an American legally...like our famlies did.
@SenSchumer Paid for by whoever will give you a check
@SenSchumer translate.let the criminal aliens that made a baby at tax payer expense stay so to stay in power by their votes
@SenSchumer where r u from, r some of ur families illegal aliens n ur us citizen , illegal criminal aliens get it right
@SenSchumer and you offered you condolences to the 14 yr old victim who was raped by illegals mr senator
they can use the money they save on the deportation force for your prosecution.
@SenSchumer that guy was here 17 years I think, so he had plenty of time to get legal
We call on and to Resigh!
@SenSchumer what about American citizens separated from loved ones when imprisoned for breaking the law? #wedontcount
You didn't seem to care about ripping families apart when Obama was bussing-in child refugees from South America. @SenatorMenendez

These illegals broke our law and now they must face the music!  Deport!!!!!!!
@SenSchumer Stop this deportation madness. Trump is a spoiled child. Mad because the Latinos did not vote for him!
@graceslick77 TY
you should not even be on twitter. You should be preparing for your corruption trial.
No Outrage for the foriegn FamilyTree that Knowingly sends #UnaccompaniedMinors to leave their homelands!? #DHS
@SenSchumer They can leave with their parents. When parents apply for and get citizenship then they can move back together.
@SenSchumer of they are illegal, they have broken the law.  Reform the laws and you may not have an issue to complain about
@SenSchumer SHUT UP BOB!!! They need to come here legally. They have torn their own families apart by breaking the law
@SenSchumer Because a mom ran across the border illegally & dropped them on US soil making them a US citizen is debatable.
How many American families have had their children robbed, beaten and murdered at the hands of illegal aliens?
@SenSchumer 
Criminals only. Come to America & rip off, you go back whether you have a family or not.
You arseholes should STOP promoting disobeying OUR laws, not good? change them ! President is sworn to uphold them ALL !
@SenSchumer
@SenSchumer 
We cannot trust anything Schumer says. He does not serve the best interest of American people.
but it is okay  to support the  2 illegals who raped d 14yrs old girl and  you guys said nothing. Hypocrite
#obamacarefail
#redirectsanctuarymoneytohelpourvets
Nobody is separating families. The kids can go back with their parents. Why should anyone bother to come here legally anymore? Ridiculous
So in other words, you want Congress to stop funding Law Enforcement because you don't want them doing their legal duties?
What about the American dreamers Senator?
@SenSchumer what a bunch of bs! How about protecting innocent children in our schools!!
you and all ur Dems should be put in jail for corruption! #scum
You will eventually be separated from your family as well b/c you also broke the law. Corrupt politicians go bye-bye
@SenSchumer if they're here illegally, then their children shouldn't become  legal citizens. Send them all back.
you are a complete hack. Further you know nothing abt rule of law!
@SenSchumer not if their parents are illegal trouble for the US
We actually need to double the funding.  Maybe some American can find employment is there were few wetbacks/
@SenSchumer it's called @ICEgov & these families made a risky decision now they must face the consequences, help them cope
@SenSchumer Children can and should stay w parents. Even if that means going to Mexico w parents.
@SenSchumer  IF FAMILIES MEMBERS OF THE ILLEGALS LOVE THESE LAW BREAKERS THEY CAN GO BACK WITH THEM. #illegalimmigration
Again - NO. You have two choices: enforce the laws; change the laws. I believe you are in the law MAKING business - right?
Hey is deporting criminals he hasn't deported kids stop your lies
OMG the most corrupted talking. Maybe after you go to hell and come back as a nun then we can believe your words.
@SenSchumer how about putting an end on assault of American citizens
illegals need to take responsibility for breaking the law!
@SenSchumer nope. America totally supports trump against the libtards!
@SenSchumer Pass Avonte's Law
depends on what their parents are doing.. if their parents are getting drunk and beating them.. deport them!!!
if they're criminals deport them!
next time they should pay their way and do it the right way there a illegal time to go broke the law
@SenSchumer no 5hey need more to get more agents
please commit to the Gorsuch filibuster #ResistOrGoHome
.@SenatorMenendez a shame u didn't enforce immigration laws sooner? U love 2 make somebody else bad guy. U took oath 2 enforce US laws.
Obama never stopped assaulting the American families! You are promoting lawlessness and that IS Anti-American 1000% 
.@SenatorMenendez Like how the Supreme Court rejected your argument that the bribes you accepted weren't really bribes. #NJSen
