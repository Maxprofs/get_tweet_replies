Right To Work states prosper while Unionized states fail!
Wrong, "Right to Exploit" states receive more in federal aid such as food stamps than other states. So not sure how you define prosperity.
They GET A BETTER DEAL ....   voting for Donald Trump, NOT, what's her felonious face. The walking felon needs to be indicted, tried, jailed
Libs don't get it, your party did so much damage to the country its irreparable.Dems are lying,crying,victims of nothing who want the world
please resign now chuck impeach chuckled to do his job tour fire him
They have the freedom to negotiate. But, many unions push an agenda on workers that they may not want, too.
I have relatives who work for companies that are forced to go on strike, or go against a politician that unions oppose. That's not freedom!
If @SenSchumer  really cared about a better deal for American workers then he would stop all his BS & start working with @realDonaldTrump
What @SenSchumer doesn't realize is that Americans aren't stupid ! This whole better deal crap is A bunch of BS
@SenSchumer doesn't care about  actual American citizens He only cares about getting their votes & sticking it to @realDonaldTrump
You mean like @realDonaldTrump is sticking it to DACA?
Let's not forget that anyone that  DACA  protected are from families that came to this country illegally in the first place
I don't see @realDonaldTrump 's decision as sticking to anyone ! I see it more as fixing a issue that never should have been in place .
Only reason @realDonaldTrump is doing this is because its Obama's program. His hatred knows no bounds in hurting people Obama has helped.
Lol nice spin but @realDonaldTrump is doing this because many 's want DACA gone because we want  citizens put first !
As brilliantly evolved by the late "Socialist"' FDR!!!!!!
We already do, his name is our President TRUMP.  Retire your unlawful Senator
You need to start doing your job.and pass tax cuts,imagination laws,fix Heath care !!!!
I'm sorry-- I am a staunch Democrat, and I can't believe you guys came up with such a lame slogan.  "Deal" sounds like trump not Roosevelt.
How about #ARealDeal @SenSchumer I'm glad your kinda supporting #FightFor15 but we need a living wage now, not in 2024
Stop obstructing trump
Kings in suits fight for their coffers. The greatest salesmen of the world and all of you believe them. We are all slaves to these idiots.
My odds of getting a better deal is greater at Del Lago Casino than from you!
@SenSchumer Americans need a fair deal. Americans need living wages more unions and worker protections.
On a silver platter
Democrat are HORRIBLE! at negotiation.
We want tax reform. Do ur job!
YES and we need CONGRESS to join the workers of this country by doing something unusual to them - WORK - DO YOUR JOB - correct problems.

Hey Chuck you need to refrain from voting for Harvey relief until Ted Cruz apologizes to Sandy victims and says he was wrong.
Now get back to work. Get with both sides of aisle, just as union's do, and get something accomplished instead of your normal BS
