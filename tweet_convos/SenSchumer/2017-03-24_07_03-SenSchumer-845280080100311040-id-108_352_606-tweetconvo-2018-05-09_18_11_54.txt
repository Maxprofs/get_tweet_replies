Mulvaney: If your state doesn't mandate maternity care, change your state http://bit.ly/2n1oFV4  
He understands. He just DOES NOT CARE. The GOP do not care.
It is NOT free for everyone & some people can't take it all all. Morning after is NOT an everyday solution.
No. That's not a realistic expectation, don't be so stupid.
Duh! They do NOT CARE ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE! Especially women. #RepublicansAreMisogynists
No worries. Your taxes don't pay for abortion anyway. Hyde Amendment stopped that over 40 yrs ago.
Mick Mulvaney is my new top pick for anti-Christ. Didn't think Ryan and McConell could be beat but there you go.
Did he NOT see the size of the Women's March throughout the US and the world . It's not adviced to anger that many women.
@SenSchumer @PPFA the republicans are handing you midterms and next president get strong don't stay weak
@SenSchumer @PPFA If you think Obamacare is so great, you should voluntarily drop the plan we pay for you and get ACA instead.
obviously you don't have family or kids! Or a minority that murders ur kids,or family specially if ur a minority! Liars!
it pissed me off that my hard working tax$ pay this imbecile's, heartless, idiot's salary.
He is GROSS!! I feel sorry for his wife....if he has one!
I'd rather change my country, the health of all Americans should be a priority.
Thank You Koch Brothers
if I don't wnt maternity benefit's I shldn't have to take it or pay 4 it I shld have that choice not you
@SenSchumer @PPFA mulvaney is a heartless tool
@SenSchumer okay dems offer up single payer 2018 is not that far away
Why don't we just give 18 years for maternity leave, paid for by democrats of course.
in Canada, we have 18 months. 
what u are missing is that you can have better health care plans.the GOP is in bed with ins companies.America is wealthy.
@SenSchumer @PPFA Why isn't Congress on Obamacare? It must be great having NO DEDUCTIONS AND FREE PRESCRIPTIONS ON THE TAXPAYERS
Mulvany needs to hear women's voices loud and very clear !
Again! People are not commodities!
better and easier  to change your representative
@SenSchumer @PPFA What ever, misinformation and disingenuous that is the way of the donkey party.
Seriously?
No, it's not that he doesn't understand. It's that he doesn't care. This is the GOP view of women.
@SenSchumer @PPFA utter arrogance and stupidity
Not everyone needs maternity care fool!!
@Ivy45artLily @PPFA  why don't we castrate him instead. Are all of them who are trying to rule our health.
most Unbelievable BULLSHIT other then whenTRUMP's LIPS MOVE
@SenSchumer @PPFA Mulvaney is an idiot and he's dangerous. Get rid of him
@SenSchumer @PPFA says Schumer who forgets everything he's against now he was for with Obama. Total joke. #termlimits.
@SenSchumer @PPFA and senate dams do? Horse poop! You're the doofuses who think Planned Parenthood does mammography.
@SenSchumer @PPFA it is not that he doesn't understand--He Does Not Care!!!
U Dems r baby killers. How do u live with that?
If this happens watch the big insurance companies race to their unlimited tills to buy their way out of state mandates
@SenSchumer @PPFA more lies
Devil
I loathe that man.
why do we look to fed government to solve local problems caused by actions at federal level? Is he serious?
and is also too stupid to realize that the cost also effects their spouses, partners, children etc
And he knows Backward Ass Red states like SC won't help anyone with care.  The GOP is a pig party of greedy white men.
@SenSchumer @PPFA and then dont get covered because the freedumb caucus took away the pre existing condition language
@SenSchumer @PPFA I hope the dems can put a list of states to move to for adequate insurance coverage. Already planning move.
Maternity leave isn't vacation. It's essential for long term health of mom & baby.Saves $ & lives in the end.
I'm so happy this guy is not my Congressman anymore. 
@SenSchumer @PPFA And has never heard of underwriting. Thinks that premium for a 60 yr old woman buys maternity care for her.
Geez... If ya'lls state doesn't allow women to vote...
@SenSchumer @PPFA What is WRONG with this guy? Instead of changing your state perhaps CHANGE your state's congressperson!
@AgitatorsNeeded @PPFA Perhaps easier to change your Senators & Reps...
Repubs really think we live in 1775...on so many levels
@SenSchumer @PPFA Just read that Mulvaney has triplets ! What does that say about maternity care?? It means VERYmedical bills!
The Nuclear Option was cool when it benefited the Dems huh!
Mulvaney is a POS.
Going to be changing my rep pretty soon!
@SenSchumer @PPFA Easier said than done pal. How bout you change your attitude?
don't they also want to get rid of state regs so ins co's can sell over state lines?  Neat trick they got over there
@SenSchumer @PPFA Wow! Thanks Azzwipe lil Mulvaney
@SenSchumer @PPFA. Please,  trump has no business making ANY DECISIONS. 
WHAT DO WE DO?
@SenSchumer @PPFA blo me
@SenSchumer @PPFA please fight hard for us Chuck. Save lives and save the ACA. Women do matter and we thank you
Here's your sign!
A staffer in my Dem run state told me to change my state when I voiced opposition to a gun ban proposal. So F off.
Mulvaney saying you should change your state if it doesn't cover maternity costs. I'd rather change Presidents & Cabinet.
like it's so easy for a woman to pick up their lives and move spoken like a true out of touch rich prick
*Bizzar Thinking!
If you don't want to shop4/include healthcare:
change wives,change kids,change parents,divorce spouses
Do not pass this bill, so bad, we need all that they are getting rid of.
Said like a true fascist.
The you sign up for Ocare and learn the truth.
Or its importance for the nation's economy.
cause is so easy to pick up and go. Some people have the head misplaced
How about We just change our representation #2018
that is ridiculous!
another idiot in this Administration
ppl who can afford to leave red statues will leave and those who can't won't be able to pay bills. Great economic plan.
