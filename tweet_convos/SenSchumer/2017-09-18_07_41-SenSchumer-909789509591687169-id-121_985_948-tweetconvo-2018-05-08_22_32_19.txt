Why are we talking about trump care instead of medicaid for all?we are corporate democrats and our masters like that free money.
Medicaid for all? Who will pay for it Einstein?
3% wall street tax covers it all
Wall street firms and financial assets companies not the investments themselves. Then 3% of income and all the kids are covered.
How about lazy ass parents get a job and cover their kids. My tax $ shouldn't pay for anyone but my family
I have always had a job and tried to cover my kids.however thr times my medicaid was cut off for my kids is absurd.this is about the kids.
If I don't have a job my kids won't have health insurance. I took a $60k pay cut, my premiums went up, no help with anything.
Look at the boon group they have some.medicaid based pricing coverage it was what my kids needed.
#TrumpsAWhiteSupremacist
More lies. $554m for illegals?
Why aren't you a cosponsor of the Sanders Medicare for All bill?
You LIE Chuckie!!
Good. Cut it all down.
So, how much of your soul will you sell this time, @Sen_JoeManchin ?
Senator Manchin has been against the GOP repeal efforts from the beginning. It's @SenCapito you need to look at.
He's got a wicked man crush on tRump, but agree on Capito
Oh I agree, but at least on healthcare he's voted for WV the whole way. She sold us out first chance she got.
That's because West Virginia is coming out of Democratic control and getting jobs and economy going in the right direction.
Jobs and economy? Whaaat there's nothing there except shuttered coal mines and heroin overdoses.
You had better make a visit. Along rt 79, distribution centers, many healthcare places lots going on. Timber industry strong.
Yeah, healthcare facilities take our federal money to care for obese smokers and overdosers.
How much will the survivors of this year's hurricanes lose? Jobs disappeared w/the floods and winds-there are new pre-existing conditions.
DO NOT BELIEVE THIS MAN
UNTRUTHFUL AND ALLERGIC TO WORK
Says a Trump bot..
As long as anyone in DC is more concerned about their careers and benefits than their constituents, the citizens of the US will lose.
You are the biggest bullshit artist on the planet. All you know how to do is promote fear and anxiety. You have done nothing to healthcare.
Lots more $ for military u & obama tried to dismantle and destroy
Republicans keep their credit cards paid off. Democrats keep theirs maxed out or file bankruptcy.
Sch will lose thousands if he fails to protect the lobbyist which have him dancing like a puppet. #MAGA @SenSchumer Resign
no #publicoption ? repeal it. u have had enough time.
Is there a way for us to see the proposals ourselves...
Need tobacco, coal, gas or oil?...go dig a hole and get some. Need health care?...go dig a hole and stay down in there. -wg
Healthcare needs to s bipartisan. Save #ACA.  Fix ACA! Make it affordable 4 all.
Perhaps you should have done a better job the first time around instead of the mess helped create. How u still have a job l'll never know
Still do see the problem. Gov. Need to get out of healthcare.
We lost a hell of a lot more than that under ObamaandDemocratsDontCare about people from WV. Hillary wanted to bankrupt us. So FU Schumer
@SenJoeManchin @SenCapito Please take note as to how this would hurt your constituents and vote NO.
Again, a great start on balancing the budget. @USRepKCastor .@SenBillNelson .@SpeakerRyan
Dear Chuck: that is about $4.75 out of every taxpayer's pocket. Keep up the cuts!
NY & CA will have the most taken from them. Please fight 4 r lives the way ud fight 4 ur own! #Medicaid #TheResistance #Fightback #Trumpcare
Any senator who votes for the #CassidyGraham bill will have #BloodOnTheirHands
Stop this bill by whatever means possible. Yet again another abominable healthcare bill that will kill, not heal!  #GrahamCassidy #TrumpCare
#RepealACAnow
Coal miners have great pensions and healthcare provided by the great coal companies they worked for all these years they can afford it. Lol
She won that election.#TrumpRussiaCoverUp
Shut up already
Please make sure that this abomination of a bill does not pass.

That's good!
Chuck Schemer saying Obamacare is unaffordable
If Chuck is saying it? It must be a lie! No such thing as a Trumpcare!
Chuck, all you do is whine and never provide a solution. Please give me a reason to support you!
So, what are your proposals  to correct that? Put them where we the PEOPLE can read them ,agree or dis.
Don’t act like you give a shit about us anyway
Lie lie lie
We the people could take you serious if CONGRESS had same heal care as regular Americans.....Chuck we no dems need the voters
Does @SenCapito CARE??????
So what you are saying is we are wasting all this federal money on a failing Health care system????
Just shows how much waste is in the ACA
Sounds like John Q Taxpayer might be reinbursed for the Obamacare Bribes of 2010 to Nelson and Landrieu, as well as the Kansas Kickback...
so go to your money tree and pick some fruit
So it's better for 3 states including yours Senator to take up to 40% of Obamacare money? Oh, that's what this is about!
You mean you will lose kickback money if this passes. You cant have you income lowered now can you?
I called my senator
Good thing they are the healthiest state in the US!
Well, they're sweetening the pot for WV to ensure that @SenCapito votes for it. But the voters shouldn't fall for it. #ProtectOurCare
Maybe if you & @NancyPelosi explain to @realDonaldTrump what this bill really is, he will understand it is NOT what he PROMISED!
He is only hearing from @GOP @SenateMajLdr about bill details (telling him what he wants to hear). Need to make sure he hears "Both Sides"!
Democrats are still clueless. This is just amazing. Trump won will campaigning for repeal. U realize America has already spoken?
Under Obamacare Americans lose Billions and can't afford to use it time for Congress to get it.  No single payer FULL REPEAL
That's $307.00 per person per year. Much less than one month premium of Obamacare. What's the big deal???
Chuckles just claimed West Va. for New York too.  Not even a vote?
At least Crimea voted to be annexed to Russia, fair and square.
#2018IsComing 
People in Congress are going away!
We will repeal their retirement to pay for the debt they created!
Lie lie lie!  Tell the entire story about block grants!!!
That is our tax $$ Mr. Clown boy, 2 much of our money goes things that l did not ask 4 tax money doesn't grow on trees
Are you explaining it correctly  $554 millions that is part of Medicaid program.
Keep it up, Chuck! Let's hear more
Federal funding is not health care.  Many of your followers won't get that.
Your state receives a huge subsidy from nation's taxpayers due to your state's high taxes and the effect of state/local taax deductibility.
# protect our expensive high deductible useless awful healthcare
Once again all blah, blah, blah and no help. You are definitely part of the problems existing in the country. Pathetic!!
@David86279674 Another red state...who you vote for matters!!



Every state should lose fed money! Force to cut back, stop free stuff abuse! Holes need to be dug, shirt shoveled! Earn it!
NY & CA will be the biggest losers. But Middle America will get that extra money. Repeal Obamacare Now!


#GOP #TrumpCare is back via #Graham/#Cassidy!  #ACA Repeal must be STOPPED! “Andy Slavitt w/@chrislhayes”  https://vimeo.com/234153418?ref=tw-share … #SaveACA
Trust the people . Most have a functioning brain and will back the right plan..  We just need to give our representative a kick in the knee.
How is the DNC communicating these messages repeatedly to the Trump base? You need to get way more aggressive.
@SenCapito @RandPaul @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins #NoGrahamCassidyDeathBill #VoteNO #SaveAmericanHealthCare #StandStrongForUSA #VoteNO
.

Lol and under obama care 

Oh wait they lost that when you

 @DNC  won

.
What part of Obamacare are they all exempt from? I'll wait.
Let's say we sent them all that money. Where would it come from?  Our Chinese credit card is about maxed out. Then what? We are broke!
We're $20 trillion in debt!!How long can u keep up the charade that we can afford all these entitlements?It can't last forever...Then what?
Fake news,  fake numbers.  Granny over the cliff is next on your list of BS chuckles?
Forcing the votes? Cheaters, liars all the Trump admin and some top GOPers. Must GO! Maybe to jail. Senate must convince House, IMPEACH.
You mean less American tax dollars are being used? I know Dems love sticking it to the average taxpayer.
Please do all you can to block this bill,including withholding consent.It's vital!
How much $ is WV losing taking down the horrible history of the Dems fight 2 perpetuate slaver statues ?
under ACA all Americans lose billions!
How much of that will go into the pockets of @GOP Senators, the 1%, Goldman Sachs & Trump? Enough!
Chuckle's Chucky The Clown 
#44Care is a joke.. if it is so great why doesn't Congress use it ??
Thanks to Trump's lies, his supporters will take it in the shorts the hardest.
explain why and if any impact. nobody just takes your word .
You created time for this to happen with your Chuck & Nancy deal.  Now, you have to bring the Senate to a crawl.
cc @SenCapito
Chuckie, everyone knows you are playing a numbers game, only gullible Dems believe u
Health insurance wasn't meant to be a federal program, plain and simple.
