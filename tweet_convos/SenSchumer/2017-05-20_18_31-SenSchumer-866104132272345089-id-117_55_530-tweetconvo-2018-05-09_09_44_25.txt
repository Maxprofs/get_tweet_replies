Each one that accomplished this worthy achievement did so because their parents did not choose abortion. Congrats to all.

Congratulations! What an honor to have you do their commencement speech.

Get real crying Chuck. You and Pelosi are two big losers. You have nothing to offer to America but bigotry and lies.
Your protege, Anthony Weiner has graduated to high school girls. When you you make your statement about that sick bastard?
I enjoyed your speech at my graduation a couple of years ago!


Maybe you should personally pay off their student loans?  Likely not. Let the taxpayers foot the bill.
Chuck did you cry? America wants to know.
Did you whine about how bad you were treated?  If not, then I'm sure your speech was good.  #PresidentCryBaby
Chuck your a waist of an American. Turn you rights over to someone that can do some good. 2018 dems will pay Bigly.  This s_counsel backfire
Can't write or spell? You must be a Trumpian. Repubs out in '18.
Congrats to all!

Poor kids couldn't hear from a man with testicles.
Good thing you had your liberal card on you or you would have been thrown out like all the conservative speakers.  #Tolerance
Instead of wasting taxpayers dollars in doing this and taking off for recess, why don't you work with the Reps on the economy, health care..
Did you cry some happy tears on this happy occasion? If so, were the tears real this time?
I mean the last honest person
I seem to remember the Repubs doing that to Obama for 8 yrs.
