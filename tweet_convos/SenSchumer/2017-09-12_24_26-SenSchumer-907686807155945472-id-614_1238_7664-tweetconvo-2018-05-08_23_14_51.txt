I dunno about @SenSchumer, but I'd like to know how we pay for "Medicare For All", @SenSanders. Same ?? as in 2016, still no answers. 
Then you get a limited amount of services and get a supplemental like Medicare patients do now.
That's a pool that pays Srs' benefits now. When the # jumps up to 200+million people, that available pool shrinks.
The Gov is going to have to Negotiate and help bring down costs and find smart ways to manage the money.
Those are the keys, right? This is going to take time and thought, and no one's done that, yet. Everyone's lining up behind a slogan.
The problem is that the GOP is working hard to dismantle what we have and in the days of TL;dr slogans sell.
I know. That's why I think we need a bipartisan stabilization of ACA, FIRST. Then consider #MedicareForAll seriously. Sanders scares me.
He's frankly a lot like Trump: Grand, sweeping statements/ideas, but let someone else figure out the nuts and bolts.  #lemmings
I like how you're trying to go "How do you do fellow kids?" But people don't care about that. They care if you're supporting #MedicareForAll
Oh my!  The retro look!  How fashionable. Now, think about Sanders bill and he it might actually become a reality.
have you found your spine yet and endorsed @SenSanders Medicare for all bill?
He actually has the spine to not support it because it has ZERO specific way to pay for itself.
We'll pay for it with all the money we waste propping up the insurance industry. And cutting from the military. And taxing the rich. Easy
Our annual tax revenue is about 3 trillion, meaning his plan is our ENTIRE annual revenue, we could never pay it off by taxing the rich 1/2
Tech Savvy Schummer, are you a knuckle head or what. Please spend your time finding out why me middle class Pete is paying 52K in payroll
PAYROLL Taxes after I'm done. Do you MOMo's  remember no taxation without representation. GET TO WORK SHIT FOR BRAINS
As a NY resident, I'm glad you're on the pressing matter of iPhone 9 rather than speaking up in support for #MedicareForAll. Stay relevant.
Seriously, no statement thus far on #MedicareForAll?  Are you looking to be the most irrelevant minority Senate leader in history? Pathetic.
Probably Hillary's from the couch behind U while visiting the close friend of yours, The Wienstien fella.Take a hammer and smash it to bits
Find your spine, your heart and your balls
LOL.  It was hidden behind your Abacus.
Pulled it out of his ...
I still have one of those even though I finally bought an old version of iphone a year ago.  I miss my flip phone.
Doesn't look at all like an iPhone
Did you get it from Imran Awan?
You certainly know your Electronics.
Pulled it out of your ass along with your last brain cell?
Keep looking, maybe you will find the courage to cosponsor Bernie's MedicareForAll bill.
You da man Senator Chuck!
Hahah!!!! There it is!
Work with TRUMP......We need a real tax break PLEASE!
...and that would be me...I'm 60 and just got my first smartphone so I can totally empathize ;D
Doesn't look like an iPhone to me?
Quite worrying about your damn phone & do your job you damn crooked politician
Great Chuck. Call Bibi and ask him how great their universal healthcare is. That we help pay for. Then call Sanders and sign on to his bill.
Speaking of Bibi, I'd honestly worry more about how he is a Haredi equivalent of Tr**p. (PS The chiloni schtick is a hardly-there ruse.)
His son Yair has gone off the deep end.
For a Netanyahu, what we consider "off the deep end" (much less "off the derech") seems like the norm.
could you be more of a dork?
But your brick phone is still active 

Oh you found your head? Was it up your ass?
love your sense of humor...you'll need that when Trump stabs you & Nancy in the back again...Trump can't be trusted
Nap time chucky, what are you 80?
oh...YOU can afford an iPhone
Seems @realDonaldTrump lkd this #iPhone joke more than @SpeakerRyan's lame attempt to tie it to tax reform. Guess who's NOT coming to dinner
NOW LEARN HOW TO USE IT!!!! CHUCK!!!
Why aren't you standing up with @SenSanders introducing the #SinglePayer Medicare for All Act? You need to do what's right for New Yorkers!
Looks like no. 1 on the most wanted list of the FBI .
.Give to @realdonaldtrump - will help with the tweeting
Is that why you haven't called @SenSanders & co-sponsored #MedicareForAll?

Perhaps that's my missing flip phone Senator?  Be cautious the mic is always hot & I will get the open mic - hopefully it will be tonight.
Call yourself and demand you support #MedicareForAll.
Medicare 4 All, Chuck.
http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/083/240/8f5.gif …
Say NO to more taxes. Say NO to @SenSchumer
You will be primaried. Back single payer or get out of our way.
As one of your constituents, I find it reprehensible that you're tweeting this stupid shit after not supporting the new Medicare bill.
So cute. Now let's try something useful like backing Sanders's Medicare for all bill. And maybe tell Nancy Pelosi this IS a referendum.
Chuck, you wascally wabbit, you.
Now use it to call @SenSanders and sign onto his #MedicareForAll bill!
.... That was the day Chuck Schumer became Senatorial.

My 98 year old mother has the same phone. You're a sensible guy, @SenSchumer
No, that is your controller for the lazyboy someone gave to you as a gift.
Nope! This is it.
hey, that's mine! Where was it?
this looks like a behind-the-scenes, pre-makeup look at the IT clown.
CHUCK and NANCY!!
dont you mean "yourPhone1"?
No one likes you
It was in his pocket all this time! Amazing.
Your phone is as old as your views on the economy.
@ErinRWarren Schumer has fixed your concerns.
Oh thank god.
@AngeloRoefaro knew it!
#MedicareForAll
Did you find a spine and integrity there, singlepayer is the only future
get serious and co-sponsor @BernieSanders #MedicareForAll Senate Bill, supported by 80% of Democratic voters and over 60% of the country.

Haha  fun! Let the free market work in health care is cheaper for all 
Time to use that phone, call those corporate donors and tell them to piss off. We have enough corporate politicians.
You're starting to spend a lot of time on twitter instead of doing the right thing for Americans by not siding with @SenSanders
#SinglePayer #MedicareForAll
How are you representing NY if you haven't even endorsed @SenSanders Medicare for all bill? Don't be a corporate sellout
Co-sponsor the health care bill! #MedicareForAll
How about cosponsoring the Medicare for all bill???
what is created is this about? I must have missed or forgotten something important!  although your grin says you are up to mischief.
Mr. Senator,
Get to work. Americans could care less on what cell phone u use. It is paid for by the tax payers. Wasted dollars!
Back @SenSanders Medicare For All or else
How much have you accepted from the Pharma/Private Medical lobbies?
Please support the single payer bill put forward by @BernieSanders. I would rather you focus on politics than technology
That shows how out of touch you really are... Chuck the schmuck
Might I suggest where you found it?  Where get most of your thoughts - out of your butt!
Find Windows 9 and I'll be impressed.  Also, please cosponsor #MedicareForAll
I always said chuck you were the bleeding edge of what yesterday was. I find your political views from the same era.
I'd fire your social media Mgr
Your a joke!!  You should do something productive. Give up Senate/Congress exemption to ACA .(OPM rule 78 Fed. Reg. 60653-01).
I heard he is an old flip phone
shame u can't find the time to your oath of office or the courage to DO WHAT u where elected to do step p down we need leadership
You can't get a Top 100. Sad. How many billions 4the cure? The Foundations?
Most must use patents only? Oh..NO! Why patents 4everything med?
Time for you to get behind Americans who need #MedicareForAll 
You don't want to be one of those left at the station, amirite?
Dad. Get of the internet you're embarrassing me!
Did you find Hillary's emails
LOL dad joke ftw
Ooh, fancy phone
How can you tweet? I think it's time for morse code.
Because that's important. So funny. Don't quit ur day job. Well, now that I think about it, maybe u should. Not like ur good at that either.
How come you won't support #MedicareForAll tho?
Chuck, you are adorable.  :)
That explains a lot. Outdated, outmoded and stuck in the past.
#MedicareForAll
Find the Medicare for all bill
Was it at the hamptons mansion where you party with javanka?
Hillary smash it or bleach bit that thing?
What we need is #MedicareForAll and your support in @SenSanders bill!!!
iPhone 9: The apex of post-WWIII cellular technology. The reconstruction is glorious!

Find your spine and get your head out of your iPhone 9ss and support @BernieSanders on his proposal.

Stop deflecting from your lack of support for Medicare for all
Good humor!
We don't pay you to be funny. Be a true leader and help @SenSanders and all the dems supporting "Medicare for all" CC: @NancyPelosi
Don't quit your day job, wait, please quit your day job.  You suck at both....
I so liked my flip phone. But times are a changing and smart phones are.
Nope that's not it. This is the model that Marxist have used for years..

Please endorse Medicare for all
Co-sponsor #MedicareForAll please and thank you
chuck and I use the same phone!!
@SenSchumer Seyour smile lights up the room. Thank you for what you do and please keep smiling.
Has the Sim card been removed?

And I found the creepiest picture in history.
C'mon man. Even Trump has better media editors. #iPhone9 
#ifAAPLcouldMakeaBadAd
How can you legislate on cellphone privacy laws when you don't understand the scope of modern technology?
And I don't expect you to have the latest phone, just one that is internet enabled.
Yes but I think u may have lost ur mind Its time for you to go into retirement with ur best bud McConnell Bye Bye
Sigh, Grandpa...
LoL
dude wtf is this

I hope you didn't pay $1,000 for that one!
Great. You now need to find your spine and co-sponsor Medicare for all with @SenSanders along with a third of your caucus
I love dad jokes!

single payer, dumbass
Which Schumer are you liar?
Hey Chuck, support @SenSanders #MedicareForAll bill
hey how about you co sponsor #MedicareForAll
single payer single player single caller- make it happen senator
You should use it to call @SenSanders and sign onto his #MedicareForAll bill.
Haha..@SenFranken hilariously talks about Chuck's flip phone in his book. Funny.
Find a single-payer bill & give me back my phone.
NOW MAKE LOKO EAT HIS OWN WORDS!
COR. AMERICA GETS A SLOWER UPDATE OF CELL PHONE MODELS THAN THE WORLD. REV. LEFT HAND DRIVE RIGHT HAND DRIVE. NEUTRAL AC VS DC CURRENT.
Chuck stop playing with your old phone and get busy on tax reform.
Single payer senator
It was up his ass
Was it buried in your rectum? Keep digging and maybe you'll find Hillary's emails up there too.
.@SenSchumer Let us know when you find your backbone to support .@SenSanders' healthcare for all.
I hope your untalented niece didn't tell you to do this.
Senator you're a corporate Coward. Time to support #medicare for all or you're gonna get primared.
Find my missing #Medicare4All
Lmaooo
So you can tweet more classic lies with it! Lol
Get on board for Medicare for All, Chuck.
Just be glad 
@tedcruz 's "staffer" didn't find it.
Great now use it to call in support of Bernie's Medicare 4 all bill
We've come full circle
Comedy isn't your thing. Backing Bernie's healthcare bill could be. How about you find your vote for that and leave the jokes for Any?
Russia has told the world Trump is their man. The Leader of the Free World (previously) OWNED? Nobody should be talking about anything else
Is this one of the original OBAMA phone? Is it still working? Could be a collectible.
