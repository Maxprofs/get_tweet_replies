God forbid the federal government stop carrying states like New York where local income taxes are astronomical. Cut taxes at the local level
He's repealing state and local taxes not the deductions themselves dummy
The ACA tax raised taxes on millions of middle-class families...  
Name one thing Democrats have done to lower taxes or reduce spending?
Good. Please tell the American people that this is a huge transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 1%.
The real problem is for the blue states that keep spending. Why should the high state tax rates that you racked up be subsidized by me?
Still bitter Schumer ?
Im from NY, and I wonder if it is fair for the rest of the country to subsidize the high taxes here.  What have you done to curb them?
Is it fair for East Coast to hand more fed tax dollars to the poor states than the get back in benefits?
Everyone should pay less in taxes, but we have a bum like Chuck and you have Pocahontas and the should work on running their states better
BTW- Warren is well-respected. Sorry about Trump...
LOL! Warren won't win again. Charlie Baker is well respected, Warren is a joke
State tax is only a few percent, chuckles. The standard deduction is doubled. Stop LYING.
Wait, what? The middle class DOES pay taxes.  There is no loophoole. We are 51% of America. Middle class pays the most!!!!!
I have to file bankruptcy after having a C-section while you suck off the tit of the government and refuse to WORK
Go retire
#BULLSH#T #LIAR #OBSTRUCTIONIST
Sen Schumer, recalculate that using 3 tax brackets instead of five and double the single/married rate deduction + add $500 per child
All this is true, but pennies compared to un earned wealth transfer under #estatetax.
Sounds like ppl in NY need to vote the Tax Maniacs out of office.. may the truth set you free... #MAGA
Talk about how Hillary and obama sold out our country!
There you go.. Millions impacted..dont forget its racist, and babies will die. Like the proposed budget..I mean health care..same script
Wow, you've apparently somehow managed to read a plan, that hasn't even been written yet, you're good! Either that, or you lie and pander
While that is true, they did realaese an outline to the plan. I think around Sept. 27th or 26th. Either way, what he is citing was part of that outline and by saying something his goal might be to have them take it out of the final written plan.
Or, his goal might be to spread partisan bullshit, all over a plan, the specifics of which have barely been outlined let alone detailed.
Did you read what was presented? In simplistic terms-do you understand that the top rate was reduced and the bottom rate increased?
In simplistic terms, you do understand that there's a difference between the stated and effective tax rates paid.
bottom line -the rich get the big break and the theory that this will generate growth to pay for the monumental deficit is unproven at best.
That's the problem now. Do you think the estate tax impacts the wealthy? It's avoided through estate planning - political parlor tricks.
The estate tax only comes into play for estates worth $5m+. And who do you think benefits by the elimination of the AMT?
My point here is the middle class on average receives $4000 or more of their own money under this tax reform.
I still believe it is unconscionable that social security income is taxed. Terrible.
Where is the proof that taxes will rise on MC - u have zero credibility when u say R want kill the elderly and kill kids - LYING fool
Be careful of working with the Devil Senator. Daniel Webster isn't around to pull you out of the fire..
Texas doesn't have a state tax. I prefer the double standard tax deduction. do your job pass tax reform
The facts
This looks like a tax plan u & ur dem pack  write & support what's wrong now u & obama taxed us back to the Stone Age more debt in history
GOP is sabotaging the ACA! Shorter enrollment period, no advertising, is the website working??? These crooks don't care about the 99%!
Sorry chucky closing all loopholes! No more trading donations to eachother so you both get tax breaks. While charities only give out 20%
Bot
Losing argument dem go to
Senator Schumer you canNOT let them do this.  They can’t remove the state and local tax deduction—it would destroy NY and CALI.  Unreal.
NY and Cali. need to change the way they tax the people who live there! Oh wait! Cali.. is already bankrupt and a sanctuary state! No hope!
I am a nurse in California, married, two kids, mortgage. my taxes will GO UP under this plan.
Let’s see what happens
He goes out of his way to show he’s not everyone’s president
Higher standard deduction combined with increased child tax credit lowers taxes on the middle class.
This is disgusting. Totally sick of the rich turning the tables in their favor and using propaganda to get the poor to vote their way.
The poor don’t pay any taxes.
Where do you live? Truth is, they pay. I volunteer and help people fill out their tax forms - those who make little $$ still pay.
I don’t care what claim you do. Families making less than 50-60k do NOT pay taxes. It doesn’t matter where you live.
You need to stop this nutcase
Republicans are truly heartless. They don't act human with the. Budget and tax plan. What can be going thru their brains?
Pls remove trump now. He needs to go. Immediately #TrumpSucks #ImpeachTrumpNow
More blood on your hands!
@realDonaldTrump this shit better not be true Don.
Retire !
mostly on a few Democrat states.
Lattes may be under Pressure Chuck
Please, for all our sakes, propose what you would do then! 
AND it cuts Medicaid, guts ACA. Tax plan is cloaked version of ACA repeal.
That's the one that burns you, isn't it?!?!
Cmon Chuckles quit pandering to ur base - this hurts them the most - you and the rest of the Blue Dawgs might have to actually do work

Another lie.  The tax reform lowers federal taxes on the middle class.  Your state-local taxes are handled seperately as they should be.
Dem states raise taxes on their population and the people write them off on Fed tax return   State taxpayer don’t get ripped. Fed tax payer?
How you like trump now u con lol
LIAR.  The plan is not even written yet
ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
But see as of now, my standard tax deduction is higher than my itemized deductions. So if the standard is raised, won't that help offset it?
People, wake up and smell the swamp.
total rate will be lower so ALL are paying less instead of complicated deductions that some can't even use-Lower ratebetter then deducts
Not true. As they reduce tax rates from 7-3, tax rates at the lower and some middle increase.
Those are tax brackets you are referring to - not rates 
One and the same. Research.
It is actually 4up to 24,000 is untaxed (previously 12,000) & the rate of each is lower than majority have previously paid-research
PLUS $4,050 per person in lost exemptions.

For a CA family of 4:
$18,437 state tax
+ $16,200 lost exemptions
= $34,637 income added to tax
"You're" not your. Check your grammar. And he is pissed because the President is a liar and trying to kill our country.
What you mean is no more federal tax funds for you. Start writing checks from your personal account not the taxpayers.
My family in Cali will be pushed into a higher bracket if this goes through. Our taxes would go up a LOT under #TrumpTaxPlan.
Good! California isn’t part of the US anyway.
Chuckie, you don't know what you're talking about. GET OUT OF THE WAY! STOP OBSTRUCTING.
False...
I'm in California and I will pay thousands more.

Nice meme! 100% bullshit, but it looks nice!

We don’t believe you anymore!! Americans have lost faith in you and your resist!!
This TAX SCAM is a joke and most Americans know it. We are not as stupid as the GOP seems to think
Those are awfully large deductions. What exactly are these taxes? I DO NOT trust SCHUMMER so it must be a tax that helps some kind illegals?
In the 80s they took away interest deduction and taxed unemployment checks. What’s next? Interest on student loans
I'm one of them!
Chucky change your tune...... it’s tax cuts for middle class for once, you and Pocahontas ramble on to the folks that don’t work or pay tax
If the rich get a tax cut... I will refuse mine
As high-taxed NYer I'm w/ you on this These other states' statistics don't support your case if the standard deduction is raised to $24k
.@SenJohnMcCain @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski $1.5TrillionTaxCut & PeopleBenefitsCut 4 #CorporateTaxCut, #DeathTaxRepeal-Plz stand 4 us
This Presidency is the biggest scam America ever saw! Trump wanted to be POTUS to line his & his family's businesses. That's the bottom line
Doesn't repealing this affect everybody? No descrimintation then.
I would say this is bad news but I WOULD NEVER BELIEVE ANYTHING you had to say.  #fakenews #tellthetruth #truthwillsetufree
Amen Chuck. Can we say this over and over.
BD
Nope, your lying like you always do.
Shut up Chuckie
May need a tax relief package that allows for Americans to purchase bullet proof vests.

#Murika
This is Twitter! Not Facebook! If you can't restrain yourself to 140 characters or less,stay on Facebook with the kids,elderly & mimes! SAD!
Let's see Chucky, NYers pay 6.65% state income tax, high taxes on homes and now you are concerned. Don't forget that in paper we make more
2. And then get hit with AMT so our deductions mean crap!
Stay on ‘Em Chuck!
Same Old Trickle Down Crap that Blows the economy, Kills Jobs  (Sept. lost jobs..first time in 7 years.)  Hmmm
Out do 1928
But u make no mention that standard deduction DOUBLES!!!!
Don't forget #GunControlNow
Your insane.
We'd ALL be better off with less 'Chuck Schumer'.
Waiting for when the Interest on Home Mortgage gets taken off the list of deductibles.

Bankruptcy...here we come!
Stop lying. People aren’t as dumb as you think they are.
You are wrong I would take a tax cut over state and local taxes. You act like that tax cut of state and local taxes is a big deal
Tell the rest of the story. Just like the coming together for bumpsomethings to better USA come together on tax in same
The state and local tax deduction benefits the wealthy who pay the most in state and local taxes. Plus higher standard deduction.
Make the #MAGAts pay this tax
@SenateGOP @KellyannePolls will lie and trying slimming this and some fools will buy their 
I am not going to pay my taxes next year- trump said its OK.
We do NOT trust you Schumer.
Chucky you're totally full of it, only reason you don't like this plan is because it makes our president great, and makes you look weak!
Yeah the elites will have to pay   this is a good thing more for living in those high tax states
Nah - the rich, like Trump, are getting a huge break w/this plan. (and the "elite's" taxes subsidize red states. careful what you wish for)
I like the idea I can leave my small farm to my daughter and she won't have to pay death taxes yes rich people have the same break all good
You can manage that with good estate planning. (source: I'm an estate planning attorney)
That is exactly the problem why should I plan around loopholes. I  pay taxes living I die will to family they pay taxes why punish the dead
This will be devastating to my family.  #TrumpTax
It should be if you are stupid enough to believe this.
To all the dullards believing Chucks bs. How many times have you ever deducted your state and local taxes. He is fear mongering
https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10155885332101388&id=616361387 …
Chuckie, your full of propaganda BS, for once tell the freaking truth

So @realDonaldTrump is a liar? Knock me over with a feather. #TaxTheRich #EndCorporateWelfare #NotOnePenny @taxmarch
Chucky do you DemoRats have any solutions except knock our President Trump.  Never have you made a positive statement about POTUS or cabinet
Please explain this to everyone. Where are the Dem ads on this?
Exav
Keep! Defend state and local tax deduction. Provide tax relief to working families from rising cost they face!
and take my healthcare away, and take my social security away.. When will DEMS actually tell the truth ?
Just the ones in Democrat states that tax the hell out of there citizens!!!
GOP raises taxes on 30 million middle class households.  That's nearly everyone in the middle class.
Only 30 million in the middle class. The think the buttons r stuck on ur calculator
You all had 8 years to help the middle class & didn't so shut up! Biggest claim "if you like your doctor,  you can keep your doctor". NOT!!!
That would primarily affect high income earners and if you're that concerned about it then you should urge New York to lower its high taxes!
Senator...they're taking away the Mortgage deduction...that alone will kill the economy as much spending is home/equity related  HELP!!
His followers will not believe it until too late
Can this be broken down in detail or should we just go by what a currupt Democratic party says? Just curious..

About 20% of households would end up paying more in taxes under the new GOP tax plan http://bit.ly/2xAhprS 
We don’t care about New York
Yes & u said Obamacare would save us big total lie done nothing but cost us more bad to have to choose between eating & paying 4 insurance
Lies
So what it’s NY and Cal . If all states can’t have the perks then no States should..

16/ In fact, I've heard some say tax vehicle will be easier for Rs because opposition won't recognize it as a health care fight.
You forgot your sad emoji, 
Middle class families are paying $22K in state and local taxes? You sure about that?
Yup! And anyone with a brain knows it
To a billionaire these deductions are pennies . For the middle they prevent you from going under financially .
This can make a difference when deciding what state to live in
Then people on CA & NY should vote out high spending Democrats who cause those high state deficits. I am sick of paying for Liberals crap!
I rarely agree with the Senator , But  he is right on the money with this one. If you are in the middle class you will be screwed
This MUST be stopped! No returns, no reform.
He's making a minimal opening bid.  Any part of that is a gain for his crowd.
You do know the simple minded sheep have no clue what this means right? Chuck get a clue!! Dumb it down...geesh
Dems always scream about eliminating tax loopholes and when the GOP moves to do that, you guys throw a fit
pretty sure it is the tax loopholes that benefit corporations and the top 1% that the American people hate--but sure 
It never stops!
The sad ting is that I An yur party see Trump will clearly work w/you for the good of we the Peep but all u really want to do is resist
Prove it by showing us facts please
Please take care of us!
Has ANY GOP tax plan ever done anything but help the rich & screw the middle class?
Your BS never stops . Stop playing your stupid games.
People really don't want to hear your lies
Only 10% of the people itemize their deductions and everybody will get double standard deductions. Chuck thinks we are all stupid!
Focus, one issue at a time. Pass Tax Reform! Also provides deductions, stop lying!
And by "GOP tax plan," do you actually mean "ACA Repeal"?  Because isn't killing the ACA part of the goal?
Did you take a STUPID pill or just natural?? LIBATARD HYPOCRISY is a mental disease with no known cure !!!!
Crazy!Lower/Middle Tax breaks result in commensurate increased consumer spending =economic growth=increased production=increased employment
You don't get much back on state & local taxes already The States have to have money to build/fix roads bridges help their city/State grow
NYS taxes are too HIGH from bloated state gov'mt
Instead of you running your mouth how about you working to fix all these wrongs you Democrats have made!
They choose to live in democratic run states. Why should we subsidize them.
It's not a tax plan so stop calling it that. And if anyone calls #ACA anything but #TheAffordableCareAct I am blocking them.
#subterfuge
.@SenMajLdr @SpeakerRyan $1.5TrillionTaxCuts & Medicare/Medicaid Cuts 4 #CorporateTaxCuts & #EstateTaxRepeal-Gotta to be kidding!
We should expect nothing less of them.
Tax plan? You mean the 2017 middle class income redistribution plan to benefit the wealthy?
"he likes me"
Whats New? Welcome to the @GOP Austerity Agenda... Business As Usual! All while they plump up their pockets! *elected* kleptocrats!
Thank you!!I can't live without my paper towels.
Only a 1%er or a fool would support this boondoggle.
You think? We all know that  that is the reason we have got to get turned down we cannot afford it on the middle-class
#FakeNews
Fake news!! You need someone to explain to you that this is a great tax plan for all. Why are you afraid....corruption on the democrats.
What is your definition of middle class?

Why should the Fed subsidize states that  mandate ridiculous high taxes?
Move to AZ, FL or TX
Where can the average American find this tax reform bill ? I would love to read it
Just liberals you want to pay more taxes SO PAY MORE

#TrumpTax #MiddleClassTax #Utah #Minnesota #California #Georgia #RhodeIsland #Colorado #Illinois #VoteNoTrumpTax
then States should eliminate income tax.
You can count on one thing if it comes out of your mouth and it's About Trump it's a lie a it's proven look at every thing you said
Your a tweeting fool today, Trump is hurting YOUR pocket real good with this deal. How does it feel, loosing your power and voice.

It's gonna suck us all dry. Medicare, medicade, cuts are totally unacceptable. Local taxes can be ruin.
Those of us in lower or no tax states don't want to subsidize those in high tax states.
Lie they are pepole too much.
No it doesn’t! I’m middle class and I really want this tax plan passed!
What happened to pay your fair share?
Both parties need to come to the table and work it out or did you all forget you work for us not the opposite
