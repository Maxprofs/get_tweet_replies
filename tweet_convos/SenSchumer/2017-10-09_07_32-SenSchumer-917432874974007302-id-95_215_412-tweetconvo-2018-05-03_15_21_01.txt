Pay attention we are in a class war. Those of hereditary wealth are subverting gains made by average Americans enslaving them with debt.
New tax reform benefit to us:    EASY POST CARD SIZE RETURN
New tax reform benefit to rich: MONEY $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
wrong



When Treasury revenues rise, and people have more money to spend, you may have to explain yourself.  Historically that has been the pattern.

Mr. Summers pulls no punches in this denouncement of the Drumpf tax plan.
Does anyone like or respect this guy?
Talk about hysterical exaggeration. Facts don't care your feelings. You don't pay those high taxes. #liberals are a #hate group
Mr Schumer,  you have thought that about every plan or idea that has been presented.  Yet you bring no new ideas either. Sad Shameful Schrum
No it isn’t!!! It gives me, an average wage earner more BACK! BTW, get rid of the absolute SHIT Healthcare NO ONE can afford and build wall!
The Trump Administration is an atrocity.
succinct and to the point
Ya think?  It didn't take much to figure that out. @PattyMurray @RepRickLarsen
Get TRUMP out! Come on Dems, we want action
Why? Because it lets people keep the money they earn and you can't spend it like a drunken sailor?
The Trump administration is an atrocity
Why, because it takes away the tax deduction from your rich friends
@SenSchumer @LHSummers @washingtonpost
Goes with whole Trump administration.  You wouldn't want it to clash, would you?
It must be good then.
Chuck don't worry you still keep all you unearned money.
They better rush to make it into law, as promised, by August 2017...
You dems are all a big cult just saw all of you with the pedophile Harvey Weinstein thank God you are all exposed now tank God for Trump
No chuckie u r the atrocity leader of the KKK racist obstructionist party
Here's a photo of an actual atrocity.


More than one way to skin a cat. He is promoting himself. He didn't really do well when Obama was in office. Why would we listen now
You are Dishonest at best Chuckie. Larry Summers opinion? Who cares. He is a Trump hater anyway. Thinks he is the smartest guy in the room.
Dimocrats haven't had a chance to pork it up.
#senschumer #postopinions #LHSummers If the poor pay no taxes, how exactly will t ax reform hurt them?
So is this guy
The real atrocity is that #WAPO allows political hacks like @LHSummers to post anything in their paper. #lunaticleft
@SenSchumer @LHSummers @washingtonpost This administration trying to illegally rob US citizens
And the liberal Democrats say that because their tax plan has worked so great for the American people. Bunch of morons
Like almost everything else coming from this administration!
Surprise! WAPO doesn't like POTUS TaxPlan. Perhaps Corporate TaxRate should be higher. Tax&Spend is Ur ideal. TimeToMove to Venezuela #MAGA

Liver lips, can't stand looking at this guy. Lucky for him he's rich or he'd be paying hookers for companionship.
Gen. Jack Keane: "There's not a socialistic movement that's survived the test of time... you eventually run out of other people's money."
Like me, Gen Keane was and still is paid by the US Treasury. Other people’s money.
Is that a socialistic movement? When does it end?
Please-no pics of Mnuchin this week.  I’m getting over a stomach bug
Opinions r like a$$ holes. Everone has one, and they all stink. Let's talk facts.
Not shocked at all
Once again citing a great newspaper, for you I guess!
Sen. Schumer, it is correct to say "Trump administration's" plan, because it is not nec. Pres. Trump masterminding it. (Non-constituent.)
Only for democrats!
science may prove the existence of god: how: particle physics: the time constant that produces string particles of particular length: 365
Trump administration -----------(fill in the blank) is an atrocity. From #taxes to #health to #Immigration to #environment  @GOP =#WRONG
#NotOnePenny more for @stevenmnuchin1
They are disgrace to the Jewish community!

Chuck it’s the SOS from you! NY will drown because of the liberal ideology. Give away and pray big brother bails is out
Maybe your an atrocity
Buffet agrees #NotOnePenny more for Ryan, trump, @DarrellIssa (the richest in congress) and corps #resist #standupfightback #indivisible
So once we give them all our money, do they go away?
Just working through the options here.
George W. Bush stole 708 Billion from social security to pay for Iraq. Must be paid back by 2020 or gov bonds collapse, economy fails.
Its not a plan...no bill yet...it is drunken scribblings on the back of a cocktail napkin...
Sorry.  There is a fee to read this.  Isn’t going to happen.  
This OPINION piece calls it an atrocity, but yet all the years Chucks been a politician, budgets have create massive deficits.
Time to balance the budget, middle-class America does so why should our gov't not do the same?
Of course it is! Everything out of this administration is an atrocity!!
Mnuchin creeps me out.
Of course it is. What do you expect?
No surprise. Career Politicians have built a $20 Trillion Debt. Taxpayers cannot keep up with your excessive, irresponsible spending.
mnuchin is an atrocity too.
So is this whole administration they have no policies only ones that help wealthy they divide our country  destroying our environment etc
They're all atrocious cmon!
Because you and the D.C. elite are going to have to pay taxes!
This is #fact not opinion. Thank you #WaPo
trump's administration IS AN ATROCITY!
@SenMajLdr and @SpeakerRyan need to read this! Put people ahead of politics! #2018
Well nothing can be worse Than Obamacare.  Democrats own that
We haven't had a "good" tax plan since the implementation of the income tax. Since then it's been used by other parties to reward cronies
