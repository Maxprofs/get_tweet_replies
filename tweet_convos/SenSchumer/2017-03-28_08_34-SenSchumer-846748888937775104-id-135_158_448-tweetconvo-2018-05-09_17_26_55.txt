Thank you Senator! #immigration #love #justice
@SenSchumer how about come to America the legal way
I think if you keep protecting the criminals you should bring them to your town to live
End the assault on law abiding American families by illegal criminals. Enforce our laws!
@SenSchumer Come into my Country legally.
They're separating themselves by breaking our laws
The law is the law.  Anyone who fails to enforce it, should be fired!
your Atty General days in California, You are unwilling to stop the political corruption in the state, no credo lady sorry.
so you don't want to separate family how about people that kill rape Rob and various other crimes we should not arrest
@SenSchumer okay. So send the whole family back? Sounds rash, but just remember it was your idea.
SEND THEM ALL BACK!!! AMERICANS FIRST LIBERALS JUST WANT ILLEGAL VOTES AND DONT CARE FOR OUR SAFETY!!
illegals have a country let them go and live in it. why is this a US problem
BS the families brought it on them selves  by breaking the law. Why does every one think we should open our door. Will you open your house
Prez Trump did not separate them, they separated themselves when they came here illegally.  We have laws!
WE THE PEOPLE ARE FED UP WITH THE DEMOCRAT ALLOWED INVASION OF OUR COUNTRY!
THIS is about THEIR Personal responsibility. WHEN YOU BREAK THE LAW YOU PAY THE PRICE! so NO do not STOP!
TRUMP DID NOT SEPARATE THEM THEY CAUSED THIS THEMSELVES~ they chose to enter illegally!
Obey the laws of our sovereign nation. If you want to be a US citizen have some responsibility and quit abusing the system.
It's called accountability.  Get used to it.
@SenSchumer why dont you end the assaults on Americans who live here???
Hell no !
That apply to parents with kids who rob a bank? Judge can't jail them as he'd separate parents from their kids!
"Criminals go to Jail" "Illegals are Deported" so should we no longer jail murders etc who have families? Really Dumb.
Illegals need to be deported! Stop calling them immigrants! They are not!
OMG what part of the word Illegal do you not understand where else are you going to start bending the laws.
#KamalaHarris @ #AIPAC2017 are you comfortable w/how Israel separates families #Jerusalem #WestBank #GAZA by bureaucratic & fascist means?
why don't you work on ensuring black families aren't separated. Make black men accountable for and to their Children!
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
How about end the tax payer footing the bill for illegals? Or ending rewarding people for breaking the law?
Putting criminals and their families first, disgusting.
No!  these illegals should not be in America anyway!  They broke our laws and now face the music!!!!!!!
These people broke the law. Tell them to self-deport. They can only blame themselves.
how about protecting American citizens like Kate steinle?!?!
.. Trump is enforcing existing law! They ran the risk of seperation when they crossed over into the country illegally!
Crime often separates families, criminals know this and consider it a cost of their life of crime. WHY THEY ARE JAILED. @SenKamalaHarris
You couldn't make it through one News conference.  Why don't you go on Fox and let them ask you questions? Chicken.
End the assault of allowing millions to break our laws and taking money away the US citizens really need!
What is the problem asking folks to come here legally. Deport all illegals and anchor babies, if they're any.
many people south of border do not have the time, money, papers, or information to come legally
@SenSchumer calling on illegals to stop breaking the law and living off the tax payers!
@SenSchumer Funny. Nobody thinks twice about breaking up families when citizen parents break law. Once again, ILLEGALS 1st.
@SenSchumer
Anything President Trump tries to do they fight and throw tantrums.They dont care about American people.  Sad.
@SenSchumer
@SenSchumer
@SenSchumer
@SenSchumer
Seriously.
When "illegal" families get 5-8k/month & legal Californians w/ disabled children are bypassed for aid: you officially suck
@appears w/ Sen Menendez: indicted by the Justice Department in April 2015 on 14 felony counts for bribery & corruption!
Hypocrite,you did not stand with d family of a young girl that was raped in Maryland by 2 illegals.What a shame
@SenSchumer if those people were legal residents they wouldn't have been separated!
@SenSchumer That should he a trainwreck. I hope it doesn't involve you speaking and showing your stupidity again! 
Obama----has deported more illegal immigrants than any other president

Thank you for speaking out! #EndTheAssaultOnFamilies
illegals are illegal! Period! Zero exceptions! Chuckyboy cannot pick which laws to obay
So, you support illegals who are arsonists, murderers, rapists, and child molesters?
Most illegal immigrants are not bad guys. Illegal immigrants are actually LESS likely to commit crime!
And you know you are lying to the people. Trump only wants the low life criminals removed family's or not.
@SenSchumer The New Democrats believe that families are the foundation of America. Cruel conservatism rips families apart.
No families are being separated. Ever. If I break the law, I GO TO JAIL whether I have children or not. No logic for libs.
So the Democrats don't believe in following the laws of the United States.
@SenSchumer illegals must GO
@SenSchumer excuse me ma'am, I think you got that backwards? LBJ, Democrat, and his war on poverty, 95% inner-city No dad
@SenSchumer you should thank @realDonaldTrump since less families are choosing to come across illegally, wow! How bout that
never magically made people come legally. That doesn't make any sense.
@DHSgov rep 40% drop in illegal Xing, means less families are broken up
These families should be kept united and together -- on buses heading south to Mexico. Build the Wall!
Get the F'k out of congress @SenSchumer YOU ARE A JOKE AS IS YOUR PARTY!!
@SenSchumer Dems will do anything to expand their voter base. Try listening to AMERICANS!
@SenSchumer Follow the Law!!!  It's that simple. Gee's ... without order you have chaos.  Democrats are the primary example
Hell how about we just arrest you for refusing to enforce the laws of the land.
As government officials you are charged with setting an example. If you refuse to enforce the law then quit.
When you break the law you bring grief to your families and loved ones. Don't like the law, change it.
@SenSchumer send em out together then
@SenSchumer tell that to families that lost love ones
@SenSchumer live or dead on fb makes no difference except now there's 2 cucks instead of just one
jail will separate them also.  So criminals shouldn't go to jail because it separates families????
that's all he is doing just like Russia separating family values
they can all leave together simple simple
You & your ilk are doing the separating. Decent people support their president. Think about that for a while.
Your trying to turn a legal issue into a social issue. Your saying we don't have to follow laws we don't agree
@SenSchumer Yes.. send them all back home
@SenSchumer Give your lies a rest. So, you DEMS support the harboring of criminal illegal aliens? Sad.
@SenSchumer For a President that can't seem to funtion without his family... sure seems intent on separating many others.
if I break the law, go to prison it is my own fault that I am sep from my family.Consequences
FAKE NEWS
Living in an alternate world make you think everything is fake news.!!!
Protect US citizens first. How about 14 yo in maryland. Just 1 example. when did US citizens become irrelevant
@SenSchumer @SenKamalaHarris I can't stand the sound of your whining voice
@SenSchumer thank you.
