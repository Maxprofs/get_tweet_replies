I think they had no idea THEN lied about it.
Trump lying is a given...but the generals?...NSA? Good God Almighty!
I believe the first option
Both.
So reassuring that this is the WH entrusted with our nuclear codes.
Trump liked saying "ARMADA."
One of the admirals should tell Trump he didn't send an armada steaming towards NK, he sent a fleet, which will get to NK eventually.
According to the WH credibility, I'm gonna say they lied
They are a bunch of bumpkins. Not smart and liars. I will leave it at that.
Easy mistake.  Trump saw this in the Potomic & believed it was part of "His Military". He has no idea where N Korea is...or Iran, Israel...
Or both lied and didn't know that sounds about right
I go with stupid....
I'm going with lie behind Door No. 1.
This is such a nothingburger story.
It was a lie. Because he had no clue where that ship was or what it was doing. One day someone is going to call his bluff and peeps will die
Either is not good at all, but I vote for lied. DJT cannot help but lie
Yeah but they're pretty dumb too. Jury's still out for me
I will agree with you there. Clueless. Liars.
Of course trump lied! That's all he does is lie n then lie about the lie he lied about! Everyone knows this n it has 2stop b4 it's 2late!
@realDonaldTrump We all know that the Trump Admin. cannot be trusted. The most Shameful part is that now we know our military will lie 4 him
Trump Admin, it would be PRUDENT for u all to know where our carriers r especially when threatening foes like NKorea
Cringeworthy: POTUS describing 4 ships as an "armada." This is not a word that is used by anyone who knows what they're talking about.
I'm going with had no idea.
I'm assuming lied to try and look like a tough guy but either way it is wrong and dangerous and puts our men and women at risk!
During the Cuban missile crisis Castro wanted Nuclear war, Kennedy & Krushchev cooler heads prevailed today hot heads all around. 🕆
Exactly!  But, my guess is both!
@jaketapper the Ed Markey mouthpiece.
Big Deal...trivial...more fake jake!
C'mon Jake, aren't you being a little rough on ol' Donnie-boy? This was just a case of a little clever misdirection to share his confusion.
Lied.  And now to cover it they are sending 2 more carriers (see also: effort to justify "tapp" tweet).  I have to pay for this BS?
They were talking about the Russian Armada.  This is why long distant Russian bombers keep trying to land in Alaska.  Biggest military now!
Those two options aren't mutually exclusive.
What are they going to do about Trump other than just alllude to his incompetence. Nothing has improved since day one.
nope, it's called strategic misinformation
Another WH smoke screen to divert attention from the golden showers Russia investigation.
Which would be better at this point?
Lied. They FUCKING LIED.
Probably they meant eventually it will reach going around the earth from south to north !!
Zzzzzzzzz.   Call me when this is even 1% of the LBJ and Democrat Gulf of Tonkin disgrace.
Try to imagine this happening in a Dem administration. Hearings for years and demands to resign. With Trump it's business as usual.
Hmm, wonder if you ever threw around the "they lied" phrase during the Obama years? I know the answer to that, Surrogate Tapper. Hell, no!
Is this what @GOP calls 'strong leadership'? How is this incompetence supposed to deter that stupid kid in DPRK?
Recent history has proven both to be entirely plausible, indeed likely. 

#Impeach @realDonaldTrump
Anyone find a lost carrier group? Please return to Donald J. Trump..needs them for play time in his bath.
Only @potus to lose an entire Carrier Strike Group that was not in combat! Pretty sad for a C.I.C.
With these folks, I never know which is preferable. Lies or ignorance. They have plenty of both.
Lied
My money is on "They had no idea"
Either one is totally believable with this bumbling, lying administration
Both options are bad. #impeachTrumpnow
There was no "Armada"..tbe idiot in chief got that wrong too. The carrier group is headed to Australia.
What's worse, right?
This is what it always comes down to with this Administration: 
A) Stupid;
B) Inept; 
C) Lying; or
D) All of the above.
. . . The Final Countdown . . .
He has initiated conflicts on 3 fronts in one  week yet he can't keep of the freaking golf courses.  How is this madman still in power?
If you can read you would have read on Twitter last week they were on there way to ANNUAL training event by Australia.
Trump team didn't bother to vett anybody they hired for campaign or put up for cabinet. Caused all drama. They did't check & R irresponsible
Yep, GOP is 'big tent' party... clown tent.
Can it be both
Had no idea?  Are you kidding me?
They lied because our child president thinks its smart to play hide and seek as our foreign policy. Marco>>>>>Polo<<<<<<
Fake Tapper and Ed full of Malarky is the definition of fake news.
Thanks @SenMarkey for calling this out!
You are right Jake. First they had no idea, then they lied about it.
Both
Uhhh both
I go with both
Or they are just plain stupid. I wouldn't leave that option out.
@CNN @MSNBC @SenJohnMcCain Both scenarios are unacceptable.Amer ppl lives are in their hands.
.@SenMarkey: WH either had no idea or they lied on 'armada' http://cnn.it/2ot1enL  #TheLead
Clearly a lie to even use the word "armada". This is real life, not a discussion on historical naval battles. #theImplosionIsNear
I vote for both...they had no idea so they just lied
If both malice and stupidity can offer plausible explanations, we're kind of screwed.
Trump has lied from day one. One thing he told the truth about was running for office
Well of course they lied, that's all they freaking do is lie!!
They wanted the "armada" to be unexpected. You know, like the Spanish Inquisition.
Lying seems a perfectly reasonable thing to do when an enemy is about to detonate a nuclear bomb. By time NK knows it's a lie, party over.
No idea is probably the answer How can u not know this??
All of the above
#rougepotus thinks he personally can control our military with out approval or acknowledgement of congress and top brass
Well Markey knows a lot about lying. What, Maxine Waters not available?
Congressional investigation is warranted for telling Americans this #AlternativeFact
Lied.
Either option is scary and a disgrace.
It was an "alternative armada"
Either way, @POTUS @realDonaldTrump is pathetic as a leader in crisis situations. Those daily briefings could be enlightening
It was intentional
How do you lose an aircraft carrier?
It's a little of both. Doesn't know who the gentleman in NK is and he said the military was awful not to long ago. We got ourselves a fool
Since he keeps info a secret I'm sure it was a lie
you choose which one. He claims to never discuss positions or plans of what's to come.
#TrumpFecklessLies the entire administration lied! We can't believe a word they say! What happens when there's a National Security Threat?
We believe the other team
don't think mutually exclusive
depends on with whom you're speaking
OR they gave the old head fake bob and weave
This administration still has no clue. 100 days in. Scary.
CNN claims Trump operates in zero sum game; that's really you! It's ignorance OR lie. You're too stupid to consider other options.
It is @SenMarkey who has no clue or is flat out lying for political points. Can a US Senator truly be that stupid?
Lie so much it's useless to believe anything they say.  Just another press briefing day with lies and media laughing. What's funny ??
I absolutely love how all the nattering nabobs are wringing their hands because they are no longer being spoon-fed every little move!
I kinda of like the idea of news outlets not knowing where any particular strike group is, at any given time.
Trump had no idea.
Holy shit, the stupidity is in overdrive. It is called 'deception' and has been used since the beginning of time!
HOW many times has POTUS 45 told you radical alt-left media hacks that he's telling you nothing?! Do any of you understand plain English?!
Either case is not a good look
they had no clue. This shouldn't even be a question.
DONALD Trump knew where that ship was going Dammmm! Someone tell him to stop lying already FUCCCCCKKKKK!!!
Scary either way,  but why lie?
Bumbling idiots.
probably both. Snakes are known to bite themselves.
Like alway open mouth and insert foot. Trump talk like a child, really submarine, really big ships. Hey numb nuts it called and aircraft car
they had no idea...because they are totally inept
Lying is my guess. Exaggerating was obvious. This @POTUS is hungry for war & doesn't plan to settle with just ONE country. #impeachTrumpnow
This constant nit-picking has become extremely boring. Don't you have a Russia story to talk about?
Very scary either way
LIED almost always a safe bet with potus.
Lied! Their specialty!
Hmmm. Even odds on this one
Perhaps a clever bluff to allow time for group to be in place
Trump has proved once again he has no idea what's going on.. growing up we called people like him having diarrhea of the mouth.Yap Yap Yap
Amazing how you characterize everything as either stupid or a lie. Yet, all you prove is you are the liars and the stupid. It was diplomacy.
Either way, this just confirms Trumps  administration as incompetent.
Not being completely forthright with the Noth Koreans is a problem? Because they're such honest actors themselves? #ComeOnMan
'The White House had no idea or lied' is what the mole people will read carved into the base of the Washington Monument...
Spicer: I thought you said Armani?
Trump is actually Governor William J. Le Petomane from Blazing Saddles as played by Mel Brooks.
It's called information warfare. Read the misinformation the Allies put out about plans for Normandy.
I think #Trump dropped his "#Battleship" board and lost track of where the pieces went in the "game"...
#Humor
"You're going the wrong way!"
Unbelievable that you are that uninformed and ignorant. NKorea does not have the ability to know where USN is located. It was diplomacy
So White House was either (a) clueless about position of US fleet, or (b) boldly lied (as they often do).  Either way, very bad for Nat Sec
They LIED! They always LIE. Every minute of every day. Wake-up!
I assume that it's best to assume that the White House has lied. It's pretty much impossible to stop being stupid....
Dt meant ramada to help with the nk parade accommodations
tricky because they seem to have no clue and also lie all the time....could go either way
Scary either way.  Worse than amateur hour.
he lied because he had no idea.
Lies would be consistent with everything else. However, 45 isn't the brightest so he probably didnt know. But either way they look BAD!
Or a combo, half-n-half
Either are possible, but my bet is on the latter.
“No idea” is usually the safe choice.
'Armada' conjures up the line of sail wooden ships of old. 'Carrier strike group' is phenomally more appropriate.
He has dementia. Be kind... well, never mind.
Uh...both.
And this is the response from the CONSERVATIVE candidate in the Korean elections:
Killer line from South Korean presidential candidate on the USS Carl Vinson debacle: if a lie, will not trust Trump https://www.wsj.com/articles/false-narrative-on-u-s-aircraft-carrier-elicits-jeers-in-asia-1492577625 … 
It's a total toss up. They're inept and liars 
Most likely trump was just confused abt what his generals had briefed him on, so just made crap up.
Conman-durr-N-Thief & co are either "stupid or nefarious (@Maddow) or both.
Fear mongering! Can't trust what Trumps Government saids-crazy!
Lied
Lordy Lordy we're in trouble
They had no idea & they lied, just like their Commander in Chief. It would be funny if it had not risked war & put so many lives in danger.
#Armada: Lol. Like he's playing Admiral in the Tub! No, IKE was the last @Gop guy to send an #ARMADA. Like 5000 ships. All at once!
Both.
they don't care about anything they say to anyone even North Korea!
Or they are incompetent
Faking out a football opponent- good.  Faking out a nuclear opponent- unspeakably reckless.
If @SenMarkey was concerned about exact location he could have asked the Russians, the Chinese, or upgraded his Google Earth subscription
Can't you just hear those Navy peeps saying full speed ahead to no where!
Investigation.!Whether the WH doesn't know what's going on or they're lying (either is as likely as the other) it's serious.
It's almost as if a bunch of inept, inexperienced, white supremacists have no clue what they're doing. 
Ya think?
Maybe they could have, you know, like used a Phone, gave them a call? "Hi Vince? #Trumpy here. Say, mind tellin' me where you are? Hmmm?"
Which scares you more?
It's called change of plans, shit happens in life. Idk why this is even a big deal.
LOL !!! Yes, with N Korea shit happens !
More gotcha moments from the party of hyperbole. That's both parties to be honest.
Or just maybe, their vocab skills being what they are, do not actually know the definition of armada. Just sayin'
They're probably doing a huddle right now to decide on their next play. Maybe Conway will be put in to run a #alternativefact play.
She's just bummed she has no jersey or helmet. Oh wait, she has that inaugural helmet.
They had no idea, then 45 bloviated about it, then they found out, then they had to lie to stick to his story. Standard practice these days.
Not knowing possible. Lying. Always a possibility with trump
I'm voting lied - he rules by fear mongering! If he didn't know that's worse because that means he is just incapable!
With this administration, odds are fifty-fifty.
Either is equally believable.
Either way its say ALOT about Trump and his "presidency" to Americans, our allies and the rest of the world....and its not good....
I'll take 'Had no idea' for $300, Alex...oh wait, wrong game show.
They lied, that is what the WH does these days, lie about everything.
We all knew Trump & Spicer were clueless but know have to wonder about the competence of Mattis & McMaster!
We all need to be very concerned. No close door decisions either!!
Why does it have to be either/or?
#donthecon our clueless "leader"
either way is possible with this WH god help us all!~
Lied. Next?
"They have a big credibility problem."
I guess it doesn't matter at this point. They'll never confess either way.
YOU KNOW THEY LIED !!!!! TRUMP lies daily.
they lose less pts w their base if treat it as a lie. plays worse if they come off as incompetent (bad military coord compromising ntnl sec)
He thought he was still playing Risk from the night before
Trump....hasn't ...a clue...he just liked saying 'powerful' emphatically like that.
I'm just glad we have gone back to using the term "Armada".
Neither option inspires confidence.
It's believable they had no idea for two reasons:

1. Trump has ceded his Commander in Chief status to the generals.
2. The WH is clueless.
