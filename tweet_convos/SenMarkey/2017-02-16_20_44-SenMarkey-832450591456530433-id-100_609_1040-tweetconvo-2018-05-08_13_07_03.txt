@SenSchumer @EPA fear mongering
Ridiculous claim! We have stricter protections than Canada which is ridiculous because it's adding costs to products
@SenSchumer @EPA Stop fear mongering. You need to be censured.
@SenSchumer @EPA it's amazing how you guys use Nazi  tactics to scare people. Welcome to 1936

You are a LIAR. EPA has over-regulated & needs to be slashed by at least 50%.

Same old play book. DEMONIZATION & FEAR. Jackson/McCarthy EPA out of control. DC bureaucrats run fed Gov. Dangerous game Y play!!
Genius, here's what going to happen. We are going to drill everywhere, coal trains are going again and you can and Chuck can cry
@SenSchumer @EPA you're a trump wanna be. . But you do it very poorly.
@SenSchumer @EPA REPs say "too many govt restrictions" but they're actually "consumer protections". People pull your head out!
@SenSchumer @EPA sounds perfect
You missed the opening up of Alaska today...thanks Paul Ryan...because wildlife protection isn't important to anyone.
@SenSchumer @EPA No Pruitt and you might want to have a talk with your boy @Sen_JoeManchin for allowing coal in our water.
People anti-EPA prob haven't visited Beijing lately & tried breathing. That'll be US with #pollutingPruitt. He screwed up OK bad.
@SenSchumer @EPA
ed they have to be stop..
Thank you for fighting against Pruitt from a citizen in Alabama.
@SenSchumer @EPA @larryelder @realDonaldTrump Hey JA, our country is flat broke & HRC is the email issue needing review.

@SenSchumer @EPA so it seems Trump is drying up all your money wells!  Gotta hurt man

@SenSchumer @EPA  And all of this bc DNC Neoliberals foisted the worst possible candidate upon disaffected voters. WTG, losers.

@SenSchumer @EPA looks like somebody drained the swamp and refilled it with sewer
@SenSchumer @EPA Wow...does this ridiculous Straw Man BS work with.....Well ...Anyone?
It's literally pruitts record. He's sued the EPA 14 times for christ's sake
@SenSchumer @EPA my mother worked for the EPA for years and it was a buracratic joke
but air and water improved. U may be too young to know smog of 70s  AND river burning in CLE
The WHO uses the lack of 'clean' water as a marker for 3rd world countries, so 3rd world here we come
disgusted
@SenSchumer @EPA
We are losing everything that is life sustaining. Please help the citizens in fighting this.

@SenMarkey @SenSchumer @EPA

@SenSchumer If you care about pollution, move your family to China and get to work. We have the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts.
You're really not paying attention.

@SenSchumer @EPA @SenateMajLdr  Thank you for speaking and pointing out the conflicts. Senate leadership should be ashamed!
Ahhh, the GOP is living the dream. All that energy PAC money is paying off. So are their pockets via investments.
Or Dems fight, cease all govt business, bring things to a halt, demand spec pros to investigate on Russia/treason
Thank you Senator, praying for a considerate judgement from the Senate.
Thank your colleagues for backing Hillary when Bernie would have won.
hey, nothing says "democracy" like elitist "superdelegates". This, we've been made impotent in Washington
that is what #HR861 proposes as well... the end of @EPA
it's like no politician remembers what happened at #lovecanal
