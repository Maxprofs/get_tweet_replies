â€¦ he can't answer questions at your single digit IQ level #mrfrosty
Ed, the answers are straightforward. You just don't like them.
Absolutely and if he is unwilling to answer. He doesn't get the job. #GOP on thin ice with this appointment already.
"Golly, gosh, I'm just an aw shucks guy from Colorado" is NOT cutting it!
I was listening on radio and noticed the same thing- was he coached to speak like this.  Seems strange?!
I was waiting for the background mood music to start playing....
Can't he just stick to making commercials for Cialis?
no
Like the no answers of Sotomayor Kasich, Ginsberg. They all lied knowingly to the Senate.
If Gorsuch can't be "impartial" Church & State (its complicated) does not belong, highest court  #GorsuchHearing #BlockGorsuch
Please take action to postpone this hearing until we have results of FBI investigation into Trump's ties with Russia.
No, but by virtue of his nomination by Agent Orange we know what kind of justice the Russians, sorry, Republicans hope he will be
I think we know exactly what kind of justice #Gorsuch will be. #Trump didn't choose him by accident.
One that protects and defends the Constitution unlike you liberals whom think the Constitution is just a piece of paper.  #ConfirmGorsuch
What have you done to help my working families tax burden? #notmySenator
We're not supposed to have any idea. It's all smoke and broken mirrors! And the son of Oswald's Cuban  accomplice is THE WURST!
@AllLeftNews Block. Thats the only leverage Dems have left.  And your only chance to say no. Remember, this is a lifetime appt.
Or you could focus on the person who nominated him and how he is under federal investigation
No SCOTUS hearings while trump is under FBI investigation! Should a possible traitor be allowed to nominate a SCOTUS?
Not if I had my way.
political hyperbole. Research the actual decisions he's made based on facts in those cases vs. expecting answer to hypothetical!
Ed got nothing for decades Malarkey wants to try and slander a man who everyone but Senate Dems say is qualified. Shameful.
I am a constituent. 01013. You need to block this. His name isn't Merrick Garland. Enough said.
@dolphsteelbear he'd be for big government and on the little guy, he didn't answer any questions forthright 
@SenateDems that's right! He needs to answer all the questions, even the hard ones
We know. This seat belongs to Garland not the Fascist fan
this hearing shouldn't even be happening while the FBI investigates if the president committed treason
MAKE THE TURTLE McCONNELL USE THE NUCLEAR OPTION.
@SenateDems That the plan; not to know what he really thinks!
@SenateDems He needs to answer ALL questions. Even the hard ones he doesn't want to answer.
Shouldn't you figure out if the president is a traitor & conspiring with #Russia before appointing judges for lifetime positions
There is an ongoing FBI investigation. Why are you proceeding w/this? R's wanted 8 seats when HRC was going to win. 8 seats it is
@Lehigh389 His answers will be tailored & inauthentic, a performance. Look at what's he's DONE ruled & said esp about women.
Ask #Gorsuch his views on the #EmolumentsClause.
@SenateDems Yes and he DID!
@SenateDems he's going to say what will get him into the Supreme Court
No hearing, no hearing, no hearing
@SenatorDurbin Durbin got answers with his Qs on #HobbyLobby. G considers biz owned by ChrFamily a rel institution like a church
Just vote no...
You can't just read his decisions? How are you a lawmaker? Better yet, do you even dress yourself in the morning?
.@SenMarkey Neil Gorsuch would be a puppet for the billionaire class and you must block his appointment! #SCOTUS #GorsuchHearing
I'm going to go with "Fascism Forever" judge. The yearbook entry was no joke.
We have a fascist uprising and a judge who claimed to be a fascist in high school. We'd have to be brainwashed not to notice.
The poison we've been getting has been very powerful, but plenty of us still have a democracy-first mindset.
Please demand specifics in his reasoning not platitudes on HobbyLobby and deliberate blindness to basic decency in Madden.
@TheDemocrats knew what kind of justice he'd be 10 years ago; they thought he'd be TERRIFIC! What's the problem now? #hypocrites
@Hehe24Small wow!!!! Real profound Senator.
@SenateDems The judge is an appeals court judge and already has a record.
@peoples_defense Gorsuch owes Americans thoughts on advice and consent - this seat is tainted by Garland proceedings #weobject
hello .  One know s by reviewing cases.  Are you able? Knowledgeable? To read case law? @DemSenators
does he think senate shirked duties as to garland #strictconstructionalist
You don't have any idea what kind he would be no matter what you ask, unless you know 'what NOT to ask'!!!
Please! No confirmation of Gorsuch until #russiagate is resolved!!
Shouldn't be a justice period! Hearing should be for #MerrickGarland #ImpeachTrump
If only he had served on a lower court and his decisions were available for perusal....
@SenateDems 
I'll tell you... His rulings are based on personal bias against women, queers, disabled & children. #StopGorsuch
@SenateDems are u mentally ill? Your questions are asking for political views on someone NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE THEM..
@DerekCressman i can tell u now what kind of justice he'll b. A syncophantic ideologue like thomas/scalia. Why don't u c that?
that didn't stop them on Tillerson, Pruitt, DeVos, Mnuchin. Republicans DON'T CARE,. How will you stop them?
@SenateDems He's giving straightforward answers and you know what kind of justice he will be. Stop playing politics. Do your job!
@SenateDems Confirmation hearing should be paused until more is understood about @POTUS + RUS. This is a LIFETIME appointment!
Not making the mistake that was made with Scalia
@DerekCressman #TheStolenSeat
the kind the FOLLOWS the low? Wade vs Roe IS NOT the law of the land as passed by congress, and can EASILY be rethink....
DEMS NEED 2 GET A BACKBONE NOT GONNA HAPPEN THO BC MOST DEMS R CORP STOOGES NO DIFF THAN GOP! IGNORING PROGRESSIVES HUGE SCREWUP!
SCOTUS hearing should be stopped until 45* is no longer under investigation
Obscure Massachusetts backbencher will vote as he is directed. @SenMarkey #SuchAGoodBoy
POTUS is under investigation for treason & doesn't get to nominate a SCOTUS. We will take to streets to protest illegal election
So you've decided to play to  dumber elements of your base? The ppl who don't know nominees can't comment on possible decisions
@DerekCressman Ask him this: Do you believe the courts have the power to review executive orders like the travel ban?
@DerekCressman Oh, we no, just look at his history.
I think we know EXACTLY what kind of judge he'll be.
@massdems Why are #Dems even there?! Garland didn't get one. FBI investigation, possible impeachment? Boycott this farce!
Ginsburg Refused Answer close to 100 Q's in 1994. She was a "Radical Activist".  #Gorsuch is not Ginsburg #Gorsuchhearing
@SenateDems YES WE DO. He has demonstrated by actions he is a yes man to big business, billionaires & Trump
even if they were a functioning body with the country's best interests at heart, they stole a lifetime position. NO!
The left has to stop doing 'the right thing' because the right has no ethics and you will lose always. As will the US
If I declined to answer questions on a test, I would fail the test. A non-answer is not an acceptable reply. FAIL!#GorsuchHearing
RETIRE NOW.
@SenateDems Senator, his views don't matter. Your job is to block nomination until FBI investigation into enemy collusion done.
Should be automatic disqualifier
Looks like you're getting exactly what you've asked for. Gosuch is slaying.
@SenateDems some of the questions are really not that great. A judge is supposed to apply the law not play politics.
@JoeMyGod he's qualified  and he's going to be approved . Elections have consequences
Cheating has consequences too.
How dare a judge not believe the gov should mandate everything Its like he believes in the Constitution
I know you hate the Constitution and revere Castro and Chavez.  Move to Cuba.
I expect, no demand, better grammar from a senator.
@SenateDems He'd be one that goes by the law and not one who legislates from the bench. It's not like he's been under a rock.
We kind of do - he is an originalist which means he agrees with Dred Scott decision and disavows reconstructionist amendments.
#UtterBullshit
This alone should deny this man confirmation not to mention being appointed by TRump! #TrumpRussia #CollusionWithTheEnemy
Still might not know seems there is an epidemic of lying up there! Sessions, DeVos, Flynn, Spicer, Conjob,Don the Con,....& more?
A sitting POTUS under FBI investigation should not be allowed to make a nomination...full stop

!
and you're getting them. If you want assurances on future cases, you are the unethical problem, not him.
"Why won't the judge give me assurance he'd rule in my favor on a specific topic?" Hmmmmm.....
#GOP and the #RussianPuppet should not be allowed to fill this SC seat. We need a #DoOverElection2017 @SenMarkey
