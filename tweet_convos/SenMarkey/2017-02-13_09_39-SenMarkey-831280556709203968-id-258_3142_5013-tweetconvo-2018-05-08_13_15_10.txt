ok @SenateDems lets c u ask whys @FTC  @CFPB @AjitPaiFCC @US_FDA post @minamataMEA letin @stockexchange ignore @evidenceofharm Psychotronics
it's your duty to stand up to that dictator that was elected.  #TrumpsBrokenPromises
you the Democrats are the problems of what's happening
so because the financial crisis of '08 caused by a rep. gov, the dems are the problem for a rep. breaking promises?
Republicans seem to always forget about what happened in '08 
don't even bother showing them a graph, they just see "look, its low at obama so its his fault"
nah, it's all Bush's fault lol. Rolling my eyes
GOP controlled House & Senate for the most part of his admin. I blame GOP, not just Bush.
and the Dems had control when Obama came in and yet look at the mess he created. Libs are blind
when GOP gained House majority, and then Senate majority in 2014 midterm elections. 2/2
Can we stop comparing him to Hillary? She's not running for POTUS any more, we should judge *him*, right?
We would if she would shut her ragged mouth and quit tweeting s***.
That doesn't justify still comparing Trump to her.
you're right. She lost. He's president.  let the man do his job. It's only been month u clowns
It's only been a month and he's already screwing it all up -_-
Democrats are losers Democrats are on the wrong side of History.
[citation needed]
@Gweezy52 really 1 month in and you're already starting? Lol what a bunch of clowns liberals are
terrorist attacks. 
Repeatedly he tweets like a 12 year old girl when his feelings are hurt
blah blah blah. He's still getting shit done. Which Obama failed to do at every turn
executive order for a pipeline that will be built by a company he has stocks in. Getting shot done?
he has stock in every oil company...how is he supposed to get it done then?
just like every other president with business. Get rid of it. If wanna be pres. Than sell business
Trump's broken promises? He hasn't been in office a month. Obama added $90,000,000,000/month to our debt. Who broke promises?
YES
how about #resisttrumptuesdays???
Here's motivation.... Just Do Your Job and stop trying to protect it.
Democrats need to run effective campaigns to win, rallies seem to work
you should start with all of your and Obama s broken promises to the "Forgotten" time to get off your high horse
How about your broken promises. You guys have lied for 8yrs. Just a bunch of losers. Election day is coming..
know what? Get behind Tulsi & glass steagal, then get back to me
Fantastic Work. Now you all are rolling. One down more to go w/ Trump
Plus he said that he would protect the air and water, but he's intending to dismantle the EPA
impeachhisass
I'm tiredthis is ridiculousness! What can we do?
he's talking bullshit
I love u Bernie but you and Elizabeth should have called out Obama as well for not jailing that swamp during bail outs
@SenSanders bahahahaha!!!!! You people are are so desperate
Your #mondaymotivation should be to remove the corruption from your own party and stop running neoliberal candidates. Tnx4Trump
Investigate! Investigate! Investigate!  Trump has laid a trail of bread loaves not crumbs to Russia and conflicts of interest.
the lies are endless. #TreasonousTrump
Lmao,   you always take someone who worked in a field who has experience,  not some someone off the street with no experience
Ok keep it up & there will b no democrats in DC
@HouseDemocrats it's not about #TrumpsBrokenPromises so much as his #BaldFacedLies
I'm pretty sure his next nominations go to Boris and Natasha.
@HouseDemocrats saying they are broken doesn't make them broken
Promises broken...what else is new?
that's great, but what are you going to do differently in 2018 to be sure this nightmare term is limited?? 2016 was a disgrace!
@Michaelloinsigh 

Pay attention Dems.
Flynn didn't freelance before election. Someone knew.
Who, what, when.
INVESTIGATE!
keep up the great work
can you also look into him being in Florida! I do not want my tax money supporting his business'
hasn't had the chance without his cabinet.  Do your jobs!
in a moderate independent, but even I gotta say, it's only been a month. First is too much, now not enough.
When will the Dems realize Americans know the truth & your fake news & false accusations aren't working? Get on board or get out
#TrumpsBrokenPromises
@HouseDemocrats I believe every time Trump lies or insults like he did Sen Warren..Dems turn back to him or walk out!
Dems broken party, this fight is for the young Dems, term limits would help the party get the smart team in house, old must go
@SenSanders he is destroying America not making it great
better hurry. Time running out for yall
Please don't you people get it.DT is mentally ill. Do what ever you have to do to IMPEACH this idiot. Our country is going
we can not and will not let his promises be forgotten ~ all were just words to get elected!
yep filling the swamp w/them
what about obamas broken promise. If you like your plan you can keep your plan
trump is all about PROFIT.
how can u tolerate Warren and shumer ,I would wear Ear Plugs!!!!!
You are a group of rotten politicians ,no respect  the Voters Choice
true is more worth now 
Do your jobs. Investigate Flynn's conversations w/Russia as well as #potus w/ Russia and biz conflicts of interest for starters.
Please please investigate the President and Michael Flynn. Please investigate their involvement with Russia
And you pushed Obamacare down our throats like a thief in the night. Where is my savings? Why can't I use my own doctor?
You should say thank you if you don't receive savings from #ACA, otherwise you look incredibly ungrateful and petty.
@SenSanders There's a new swamp in town. He does not understand Truth.
@realDonaldTrump fans and supporters, at the risk of hearing some facts, you might want to look at this! $$$ for top 2% only
Wait'll they find out the GOP plans to replace ACA includes a 25-28% tax on insurance through employers, reducing take-home pay.
@HouseDemocrats @CNNPolitics @MSNBC Remember, you work for the people not against the people.  Trust us, WE will not forget.
@HouseDemocrats How about you all work together for the common good on both sides!
@HouseDemocrats broken promises?? Let's get past the first month! Such a ridiculous statement
great vid!
@SenSanders A great American Con Man in the time honored tradition of snake oil salesman & carnival barkers . #SwampCabinet
@HouseDemocrats Always something EVERY Candidate goes back on I can live with this one. He won't let them go far! #MAGA#youlost
@SenSanders 
of course trump has never In his life done anything  that did not profit trump
AGREED
@ERNSTintheATL Dammit Dems... STOP ACTING LIKE YOU'RE ABOVE ALL THAT!!
Let's start with the broken promises by #Democrats:
Keep my doctor, lower costs by $2,500 p/family, T Geitner Wall Street man
3 weeks in and the Dems are talking broken promises. Stop the propaganda and get some work done.
@HouseDemocrats what does he know and when did he know it? How many reasons do we need to impeach this dangerous  MFer? Spy!
Yes he sucks. Now, come up with something better to raise the game in 2018 (and help President Pence or Ryan).
He always lies, and canNot change. He's a pathological Liar. / sociopath++

when will you investigate Chris Collins insider trading- now worth $60 mil?
He is not fighting for us. #ILLEGITIMATEPOTUS
Instead of saying he's broken promises- show us how he's broken them. What exactly has he done? Can't just keep giving hyperbole
You guys are crazy. We live in a capitalistic society not a socialist one. Which one worked for a large population?
@SenatorMenendez NewsFlash President Trump is doing more for Americans than Obama could have imagined We are fighting 4 us!
@SenSanders When do his lies become an impeachable offense. At some point hus dishonesty must be punished.
@SenSanders economic promises were just to enable racists and sexists to vote trump with clear conscience.
Can we get a video like this w less theatrical music? I can't share it like this. We need to win back moderates
That's all fine, but we NEED an independent investigation into Trump-Russia collusion NOW. Please push hard for this.
so you guys are actually at work this week?
Is it Trump's business relationship that excludes the ban on the 911Muslim Terrorist TO OUR COUNTRY.
They aren't broken promises, they were lies!
@SenSanders
Yeah, he's been in office for weeks without a full cabinet and hasn't implemented 100+ policies.
What a failure!
Broken promises is getting passed around, but you missed the biggest:You pay for Texans wall, not Mexico, did not tearup Nafta
Dems Monday morning constitutional! Prune juice and X-Lax! Toss in a bran muffin and you get a bunch more crap!
@SenSanders Wag the dog" comes to mind. CFPB with a single director answers to no one. GOP just wants to put in accountability.
you are all a sad people
why are we not seeing more information or news regarding his being impeached?? What else do we need?  Not rude. Just curious
@SenSanders trump having security sessions in public diner areas?  And Republicans criticize benghazi?
broken premises
@SenWarren it brings me joy Liz seein u shak in ur pants.the thought of brilliant educated men workn 4 free u us #MAGA
Trump only cares about the rich any one else who's not rich he could really care less about you.
AGREED
Trump just lies &  all the people who voted for him can't see that. Trump said he was for the people no he's not.
@SenSanders @SenWarren @SenSchumer Phenomenal video capturing lies & subversion by @realDonaldTrump.  A must living document!
: We like work of Warren on Consumer Protections=but WHERE WAS SHE IN PRIMARY knew RIGGED
Maybe he could use a little more time, like more than 3 weeks???????
Why? So he has enough time to dump a $25 billion bill on American taxpayers for his wall?
I AM SO SICK of THE Demos. THEY should be run out of   WASHINGTON ON A RAIL
@SenateGOP Both parties R run by a small % of elite who keep us divided & distracted so we don't join together & go after them.
not in our name, he says the American people want what he is doing and he is flat out WRONG.
he is doing just what we ask him to do..
@SenSanders Also, HC still not locked up. Just sayin.
my left ear enjoyed that
he has kept or tried to keep more promises than the last 4 dem presidents. Drain the swamp means vote the dems out, lost party!!
@SenSanders Too few Dems speaking in public and on tv about this mess. Thank God for Elizabeth Warren!
@SenSanders you guys have to come up with a new plan. This crap only works for republicans. D's get a real plan.
It's really hard for him to stand up to himself.......
Right... Fired from their position as advisers, then promoted to BOSS. We are being bullied by the richest of all.
@SenSanders what about the promise "if you like your (health) plan/doctor you can keep your plan/doctor?"
At least you could afford a plan. If republicans repeal the ACA, say goodbye to your health coverage.
I am so grateful 4 coverage. But @SenateDems tweet was about broken promises. I was pointing out @POTUS44 also broke them.
@themarketwits Who listens to obstructionist leftist #Democrat.  Prefer political brownie pts instead of #MAGA.  #Foxnews #RNC
@SenSanders Better send this over to @HillaryClinton. Word is she's running in 2020.
where are his taxes? What is he hiding?
Use his videos, chats with Faux news and twitter account to remind him of his words. He sometimes seems to forget what he's said
you Democrats are nuts we see and hear the truth we stand with our PRESIDENT Trump 62 million thats why we voted.
Vs. Hilary's 65 million
lol Five million  illegal immigrants Hillary Clinton is a liar and she lost twice that should tell you something.
Where is the basis for the 5 million illegal votes? There's no proof. First it was 3 million then it was 5 million.
2.5 million just in California you would know the facts if you watch Fox news
Are you really citing Fox News as a reliable source of info? They're one of the worst when it comes to fake news
no your wrong same news as PRESIDENT Trump .and they tell the truth about violent democrats and protesters
I can't tell if your a troll or serious.
how about you investigate Flynn and the rest of admins connection to Russia including Trump!!!!!!!Do your jobs!
@SenSanders AND YOU let her get away with hiding the WS speeches. Why? No cahones?
@SenSanders This just not working strategy when Hillary made milllions off WS speeches. The boy who shouted Wolfe once to often.
Try to help fix the country's problems that you have caused the last 8 years
The way you are acting, it seems like you're traitors, or domestic enemies of the country
@POTUS @BetsyDeVos @TreyGrowdy @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @SenateGOP @TillersonUSA @HouseGOP @2ALAW @SandraTXAS @jjauthor

@SenSanders #DontBuyTheLie

@SenSanders 
And let it be known... Sen Warren:

THE TRUTH
@SenSanders @realDonaldTrump Clearly he has no intentions of following thru on cleaning up Wall Street.  Business as usual.
you mean like "if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor". or"if you like your plan, you can keep your plan"?
Seems like Trump spoke truthfully to America.  WAS IT FALSE FACTS?   No!
@SenSanders You guys don't get it. That won't work! They're thrilled w him. They're LITERALLY brainwashed WW2 style.
ListenUP->StandUP->Otherwise->"Want Ur Grandchildren 2BForced 2BMuslim-->thenFORCED TO KILL OTHERS?"

Bunch of losers
I am the senate.
Get to work finding some charismatic people we can vote for in 2018 and 2020!!!
The father of lies. A house of lies. Surrounded by liars.
