so you have Slick Willie meeting with AG while his wife is under investigation
 2 sets of standards

FAKE NEWS
Boston Globe is pretty well established and reputable...you incompetent hack. Read an efing newsppr
That would be used to be reputable.
Disliking a publication for not liking its content, does not make it less reputable.
I think most of D.C should resign and start fresh and put ppl in to work for us we the ppl . The house is more
we support Jeff Sessions! @DavidMuir @LesterHoltNBC @seanhannity @oreillyfactor @foxandfriends @DRUDGE @rushlimbaugh @donlemon
Jeff, if you are confirmed, send this bunch of a-holes where they belong. This is BS.  They are all liars.
we need names/jurisdiction of the congressional delegation so that the voters in their districts are aware of their hypocrisy.
who gives a fuck?
@NancyPelosi Investigate Russia!
quote from Hilary Clinton. "What difference does it make". Remember that lying Ma liberals.
@Joannetrueblue home of the Boston Tea Party, true patriots!

@ViewFromWise File a bar complaint in Alabama
@NancyPelosi also he should be prosecuted for perjury!
@NancyPelosi because they know he is coming after all you pedophiles and you have to do anything possible to stop him.
Of course, they are terrified of Jeff Sessions - he won't run a corrupt unit like under Obama.
.How's the bus's drive-train feeling on your face now, Jeff?
Thank you!
@SenMarkey "About 2016 election". Answers no. You got lawyer talked and are too stupid to give up. Grow up!
@SenMarkey Bunch of folks who know their misdeeds will soon be exposed. Only reason they want him gone. Russia is FAKENEWS
Yet another reason Massachusetts is the best state in the country!!
"Thou shall not lie."

@NancyPelosi like anyone cares?  The whole country wants you to resign but you're still there stirring up lies!!
@NancyPelosi @SenWarren @EdMarkey @sethmoulton Why did you support @HillaryClinton ? Didn't she profit from selling US uranium?
@NancyPelosi #WhoCares @SenWarren aka #SenFakahantas and the rest of your "delegation" have no relevance. Whine up a storm.
U political hacks, fools, TABLOID media should have rose up and called "ILLEGAL!" on Loretta Lynch & Billy Clinton.  @CRTV

@NancyPelosi #istandwithsessions
@NancyPelosi  @FoxNews  go figure,Dems can't stand a high approval rating, so they create a smoke and mirrors #ToddlerLife
high approval rating? Trump has the lowest ever for a President.
@NancyPelosi .....Democrats Fear AG Jeff Sessions!  The Democrat Russian Trojan Horse!
we fear the majority of Republicans. We are happy when they mess up and are outed and resign
You should fear the unelected Obama Shadow Gov't operating right now!
@bannerite I wish #45 and the GOP would all resign.


who cares what @SenWarren or @SenMarkey thinks or says. liberal progressive hacks who IGNORE our #BillOfRights & #Constitution
Thank you Massachusetts. Character Counts
Bye bye Beauregard.
My Gawd...you sound completely delusional. Pelosi is not 2 blame for R incompetence.
im refering to the news article. Pelosi is not to blame for Sessions actions...blame,unwarrented.
Hey Nance, wanna explain this meeting YOU had with Russians?
why don't you explain? In the meantime let's look into Wilbur Ross and his ties to the Fertilizer King.
@NancyPelosi. Investigate Pelosi and Schumer on the drug money they get from the California drug cartels.
Another reason Massachusetts is #1
@NancyPelosi it should be all of Congress! #Sessions #SessionLied #SessionsRussia
Doesn't matter if the Pope asks also. Sessions is a good man and there is NO EVIDENCE!
meanwhile in Texas, Lyin' @tedcruz insists 'nothing to see here folks!'
which there isn't. Listen to questions and answers. Nothing
@NancyPelosi
THIS is why #Sessions is being attacked! 

This is NOT a partisan issue.â€¦

@NancyPelosi
He needs to go back to his Christmas job as "Elf on the Shelf"
Well, at least he is a civil rights icon.
