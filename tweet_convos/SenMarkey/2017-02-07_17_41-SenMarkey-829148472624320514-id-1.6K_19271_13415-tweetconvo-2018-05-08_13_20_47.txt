On the floor, I read a letter that Coretta Scott King wrote in 1986 opposing @SenatorSessions's judicial nomination: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/01/10/read-the-letter-coretta-scott-king-wrote-opposing-sessionss-1986-federal-nomination …
they should silence the whole Democratic party until they start doing their job correctly for the american people.
Lets take lessons from the Republicans. Oh, we have. They were racists in office.
the only people right now causing tension in america is the liberals and democratic office...
YOU HAVE CREATED THIS DIVIDED NATION.  YOU FUEL THE FIRES DAILY. YOU PROMOTE HATE.  FIX IT!
I promote nothing , i just don't get why they aren't working together to achieve the goal
Republicans made "Obstruct Obama and anything he does" their MO for 8 YEARS.
he deserved it. What the hell did he do for anyone
Even IF that were true, hard to accomplish anything when being constantly blocked, yeah?
You're a professional OBSTRUCTIONIST!
Thank goodness for them. They at least give us a slim shot at saving this country from the abyss.
but she was OK with the last ag right? She would obstruct to anyone right now
fuck off troll.
hate to bring some facts to ur hate a thon
Okay Russian propaganda troll. Bye bye.
Russian troll is the new racist.
Well, this one has an actual Russian name. So. I thought it was a good assumption. ;)
I would rather listen to 10 people drag their nails across a chalk board instead of listening to Pocahontas say 1
That's right use trump speak. Just a sheep w/out an original thought in your empty head
Don't need to hear Pocahontas read a letter. You can do it, so can I. Just come our and say you don't like
English please, ty.  Did you go to trump u?
do you want me to draw it out for you so you can color it in with crayons?
Why must you refer to Sen Warren as Pocahontas?  It demeans you
She faked indian heritage AA to get Harvard job. POLKA-HAUNT-US!!!
Did she cheat vets out of money w/ trump u? Did she use fndtn money  fir blackmail was she charged w/ rape did she grab pussy   no
Broke. Senate. Rules. Senate Minority "Leader" should appreciate the rules. Harry did. Oh yeah, dems were in control.
it's becoming more and more evident that the Democrat party is the one with no tolerance or respect for free speech
@Siubhan_H @SenWarren the letter should be read everyday in the Senate till it can be read in its entirety!
Whose voice will be silenced next?
maybe she'd be better off reciting The Song Of Hiawatha.
Let's just thank McConnell for the new slogan
She was rambling on about sex crimes in Mass.Then she wanted "xtra" time to read letter. Dem unfounded susp not valid
@SenatorSessions @washingtonpost The people stand with you as you speak up. Stand your ground against the new admn.
I think you need to take up reading where she left off.
There is no reason for the Dems to support Sessions after this stunt #Manchin Get him in line
If he doesn't he loses his seat and we stay in his face for the rest of his term.
they have to stand as one GOP will try and fracture then they win again
Liz Warren is the best thing we've got going right now, and I"m not just saying b/c I'm from Mass!
how are the dems letting this disrespect by @McConnellPress about a racist like sessions @donlemon
Liberals setting fires, breaking windows, attacking police, Democrats have always been the lawbreakers
No. The letter is fallacious and erroneous. I'm not a millennial and know history. Why was Reagan Admin blamed?
@SenSchumer @SenWarren
Democrats Are A Disgrace to USA.  2018 Dems will lose more seats. Americans are sick of your crooked Party
If they won't let Senator Warren read it, send another Dem up and again and again. Will they try to silence all Dems?
Yes, that would be a good day
@SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr  let her speak. What are you afraid of?
she's NASTI, FOUL AND A LIAR! #NOTAFRAID
It's clear that GOP led Senate/ House in Trumpistan have Declared War on America #No4thReich We fight back
duh. Rule 19 she broke is NOT new. http://www.rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=RuleXIX … Rules committee started in 1789. @BogeyGuyC @SenSchumer @agavecorn @SenWarren
@TheDemocrats @SenWarren absolutely #LetLizSpeak shameful they stop #CorettaScottKing letter! Fire @SpeakerRyan @MitchMcConell

@NancyLeeGrahn @SenWarren what the hell is happening there must be some way to stop this madness
theres nothing worse than a bunch of pompous white men trying to shut a woman up.
Dont you believe women in gov have to follow the rules too? Or get vagina pass? http://www.rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=RuleXIX … @Cuprikorn66 @SenSchumer @SenWarren
@Politics_PR @SenWarren Dude take the letter and read it for her
He can't. Rule 19 @senwarren broke is NOT a new rule. http://www.rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=RuleXIX … Rules committee started in 1789. @SenSchumer @chrisblaker9999
<- Don Quixote Syndrome. Just stop already, we won...
Haiku poorly composed.
Trump won our hearts and minds.
Make America Great Again.
Amazed! at how blind Schumer is to isis' desire to destroy his Jewish heritage here & in Israel
What tribe is she from Chuck. I have asked her, no reply. Is she ASHAMED to be Native American? Ask her for me please
Maybe shes afraid to say cause those that dont like her tribe will riot, burn stuff up, mace women. U know, like DEMS
every democrat should continue reading Coretta Scott King's letter #holdthefloor #letLizSpeak #RESIST #ReadTheLetter
Meg dont you believe our government should follow its own rules?? It was Rule 19 she broke. Rules important @mpenn925 @SenSchumer @SenWarren
.@SenSchumer @SenWarren Please!  #LeLizSpeak!  Will assure #POTUS a win in 2024.. Only candidate better?  YOU.  Please run!  Run together!
in 2020.   2024 is pence
.@JackilynnLL @SenSchumer @SenWarren Donald Trump will be #POTUS in 2020.. Then, #JaredKushner or #IvankaTrump 2024, and 2028.. 
@RiggsJoy @SenWarren every major newspaper should print this letter on its front page.
Tell the truth race baiters!
She called Sen Sessions a disgrace on the Senate floor and was caught. Rule 19
The nerve of these baboons hushing Sen.Liz! WTF do they think they are? They ought to be censured for such behavior !
The rules were broken. As always those don't matter.
Somebody had to finally shut her up. Come Chuck you know you wanted to tell her just once to shut the hell up. Admit
Stop whining. It's embarrassing. Democrats had hours and hours of speech time. Don't add lying Senator
You did not get it, Chuck. The thing is Pocahontas was reading in Cherokee. Senators could not understand.
Grow Up @SenSchumer @SenWarren Americans Voted Trump because WE R Sick Democrats destroying USA. 2018 Rid More Dems
@SenatorSessions @washingtonpost Each Dem senator should also read Coretta Scott King's letter on floor. #LetLizSpeak
maybe she should come up with her own words instead of reappropriating speeches by minorities
It's about time. Now if  only you,Pelosi, Waters would zip it  we can move forward.
Should have rest of her writing in which she stated 'immigrantion would be bad for black population'
I'll ask you as well... OK to silence conservative speaker at Berkeley but not ok to silence Warren?  Hypocrite
The King family was not pleased.. with Warren. Did you miss that Chuck?
Hey...chuckie..is your mic on...LOL...CLOWN BOY
GOP is showing their racism openly now. They are on a power trip. #2018
Rule 19 she broke is NOT a new rule. http://www.rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=RuleXIX … Rules committee started in 1789! duh @SenSchumer @SenWarren @curtiswhitworth
The next Democratic senator should simply pick up where @SenWarren left off. Do. Not. Back. Down.
Lol!!  I wouldn't be surprised because Democrats can't learn from their mistakes!!
They don't like rules.  Or laws. That's obvious. Can't follow rules? Get kicked off team. @dfrod77 @bradenking @SenSchumer @SenWarren
Thats apparent: Don't like election result= protest, immigration law= protest, etc
dont forget call everything regardless of proper context racist!
@SenSchumer@SenWarren LOL, Russian troll gets old told.
She >>> @SenWarren is a Champion, unlike the spineless eunuchs who occupy valuable space on the other side of the aisle...
blocking a reading of a letter from Coretta King in the Senate? R they crazy? That will get them voted out for sure!
broke rule 19 http://www.rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=RuleXIX … Not new-rules committee started in 1789. Should gov break rules? @Onthebeach205 @SenSchumer
so bitter. You need to let that anger go. Sing a song, go for a walk. Very therapeutic.
yes...I think a looooong walk would help. You're mean and bitter. Hope that works out for you.
awww, so let's hurl insults now....bless your heart. Talking to someone helps. Taking your anger out on someone, not so much
She can use smoke signals
.@SenSchumer @SenWarren you ALL have silenced yourselves as in..WE DON'T HEAR YOU because you are SOLD OUT & Caught in Hypocrisy.
OPPOSE Gorsuch....Trojan horse.  Don't let him in. Too risky for women's rights and labor, especially with Sessions!
J. Gorsuch is extreme & dangerous. Corporations are not People. Strict EPA regulations are not overreach!
Silenced her because it shamed them,  of course.
Because @senwarren broke Rule 19.  Its not a new rule. http://www.rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=RuleXIX … Rules committee started in 1789. @SenSchumer @the_moodyfoodie
@TheDemocrats @SenWarren Mitch McConnell is going to be shut down by his constituents. We will vote him out!
..your district in your state
@WOgaard @SenWarren GOP & @realDonaldTrump should remember that are history books and they are not going to look good in them.
Rule 19 she broke is NOT a new rule. http://www.rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=RuleXIX … Rules committee started in 1789! @SenSchumer @SenWarren @mudslidematt
@Politics_PR @SenWarren this is absurd of the GOP to do this,
dont you believe our government should follow their own rules? @senwarren broke Rule 19 http://www.rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=RuleXIX … @tjohnson1967 @SenSchumer
take over for @SenWarren read the letter on the floor yourself
Yeah, you read the letter so both of you will be forced to shut up!!
Every single Democratic Senator is going to read that letter, right? Sentence by sentence if need be!
Sure! But Rule 19 @senwarren broke is NOT new. http://www.rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=RuleXIX … Rules committee started in 1789. @SenSchumer @REReader
That rule applies to their roles as Senators. For advice and consent for cabinet, the JOB is to examine critically!
not what the rule itself says though. change the rule to fit, not break the rule http://www.rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=RuleXIX … @REReader @SenWarren @SenSchumer
@Charliegirl1481 @SenWarren    Quit trying to feed us a  narrative. We know both sides of this issue. You lost!
I'm so tired of them wasting tax $'s and not doing anything
Absolutely!  These days are going to end.
I pray it stops soon
what is it with you liberal dems. You don't like laws and rules.
The #GOP still thinks women should be seen &not heard.:/ #deplorable #nevermypresident #resistance
They should silence you all!
Darkest period in American political history. The GOP sinking to ever lower levels to defend Trumps UnAmerican vision
Pick up the  reading of the letter!!
@roccitynews @SenWarren nope duck tape her mouth 
She'd bite off tape in a frenzy,then run to join the protesters singing Cum-By-Ya.......
I am very scared for this country
not reading it!
I call bullshit on the GOP!!  This is getting me mad.
MUZZLE @SenWarren
why cant you see, that everyday American is watching both of you? The senate floor looks like a fighting ring.
WILL YOU PLEASE STOP IT!? AMERICA HAS VOTED! IF WE VOTED AGAIN TODAY HE WOULD DOUBLE HIS VOTE COUNT THX 2 U PPL! #DTS
She broke rules! But rules don't apply to you Democrats. You think you're above the law or decorum! Jail awaits 4 u
Sessions wants to run from his past?
This is shameful! I am ashamed of the GOP & more specofocally, Mitch McConnell.
@YNB @SenWarren The Congress is bullshit
@PaulBegala @SenWarren @SenatorSessions #LETLIZSPEAK
Let the next Dem Senator take up the letter. How about you @SenSchumer ?
McConnell is a pig.  #stopsessions Thank you for all your hard work.
People from MA were wondering could this be made into like a permanent thing. The name calling she does is shameful.
Such poor sports.  Let Liz read a letter by Ms. King.
I guess rules mean little to you.  We all know Fauxcahontas will lie to get ahead
#FakeNews #WhatSheReallySaid
Elizabeth Warren 'Silenced' Again After Video Surfaces Of MLK's Wife Thanking Senator Sessions #ShePersisted  http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-02-08/elizabeth-warren-silenced-again-after-video-surfaces-mlks-wife-thanking-senator-sess …
I 100% support Warren's censure.  I hope this is just the beginning of the GOP (and the silent American majority)...
pass PRESIDENT TRUMP's cabinet, if he's so bad then let him fall. You are hurting the people more then Pres Trump!
just give Trump his ppl ! You fools have had 8 yrs and you should be ashamed of yourselves...
@SenatorSessions LET HER SPEAK!
Let her speak.  The letter is absolutely appropriate and needs to be read for the record.
you two are just big liars. Not much more needs to be said.
Schumer, just once speak the truth if you can or dare! America is so sick and tired of your lies and BS!
Says the master obstructionist. Your party is falling apart
@TheDemocrats @SenWarren Gezzz We all know what you Dems are doing....you can't whitewash what your doing...after what Obama did
you all know better. You can't attack a colleague like that in that setting.
FLASHBACK VIDEO : Hypocrite Schumer Says a President Deserves His Choice of Cabinet
we're doing better than that...we're calling in & reading the letter, or faxing it.
WHEN is the @DNC going to start being adults, stop being troublemakers & follow rules that hve been place for years?!
I agree with @NancyPelosi and @MaxineWaters We must impeach Pres Bush. #Korea 
@seanhannity @KennedyNation @LouDobbs
nope
they silenced Warren because she referred to Jeff Sessions as a disgrace not because of the letter!!!
I can not wait for the vote in 2018. Good bye republicans!!
Keep on fighting. The Devos vote was a huge blow. Stay strong against Sessions. Thank you for your service.
never talked about all the wonderful things Alveda King's aunt said about Jeff Sessions! Hypocrites
@Amoney666 @SenWarren
@SenatorSessions @washingtonpost Yes, Sen Warren should have been allowed to finish.
Confimring Sessions for A.G. = condoning racism and undermining basic civil rights! #RESIST @SenateGOP
wait what's the word for th..got it! OBSTRUCTION.
yes she should speak
if you can't work together  then resign. Quit. Go away.
No you Schumer & all the other radical members of the party of hate & the KKK turn my stomach. Think of country not yourself.
What point would you work for country nd people instead of your political party and political agenda???
you're crying and whining and lying is just getting to be ridiculous
it don't matter she won't be reelected. Nobody listens to her
.  That would be a 'no' for me.
no you fraud you and pocahontas should both sit there and be very very quiet. Real Americans are in charge now!
On what grounds was @SenWarren censored? Vetting should include anything relevant to clarity. #LetLizSpeak
thank you for your opposition to Sessions's nomination and appointment.
#LetLizSpeak
You are allowing likes of Warren to lead party down path of self-destruction. Jobs, jobs. It's the economy, stupids.
@TheDemocrats @SenWarren  duck tape  her mouth shut
They did the right thing. Seriously 30 yrs ago. I don't  believe he's a racist and she tried to depict as one.#wrong
All racist acts MUST be part of a decision. They want Alt. Facts. Not sure we are reality based now!
Every single one of you should rise to read the same letter and challenge @SenateMajLdr !!!
@MicahKellner @SenWarren Be strong Liz! Warren and Booker in 2020 
The letter is too much for them to handle so they want to silence her.
@CarolineSelf @SenWarren you and every senator should read it and make McConnell object over and over again
She deserved it. She knows the rules & if not, she needs to learn them.
it is a good letter but written 30 years ago, inappropriate for yesterday's discussion. I'd worry more about this:
@TheDemocrats @SenWarren It's real simple Rule19 states that a senator will not directly or indirectly impute another senator
They allowed 3 men to read it. Shut down the woman.
reprehensible @SenateMajLdr
never had a problem with conservatives until they devoted their whole agenda to blocking legislation
Where is the investigation of the money laundering of Russian funding for Trump campaign? You should be talking about felonies.
#LetLizSpeak
BULLSHIT! TELL THE TRUTH CHUCKY
You each should take a turn reading the letter. and he if sits everyone down then America can see whats going on
you all should be working with President trump and help save our America not your America but our america
chuck, you're just too weak. Get it together already. You deserve to lose, but ur base doesn't. Ur losing ur base
can't imagine why democrats would allow her to speak. She's just a laughing stock
This is heavy-handed and wrong by the GOP.
Are there rules or not?  MLK's niece put Warren in her place, or dont the niece count, She dont drink your Kool Aid.
@TheDemocrats @SenWarren What should we do if we think she should stop talking?
you and your communist cronies should be silent and represent the US, not your special interest.
THANK YOU BOTH!!!!
. Get ppl. together & have them read the letter piece by piece to spite Mitch
keep delaying Trump's cabinet picks and we'll make sure the @TheDemocrats are voted OUT in 2018. Dems a party of division! #MAGA
each and every democratic senator should go up and read the letter tonight. Keep fighting! #letlizspeak
As usual, trying to rely on the worn-out playbook!
have all @SenateDems  read the letter one at a time...
https://twitter.com/expatfrommass/status/829164356248154113 …
@SenSchumer @SenWarren Just Read CSK Letter on McComrade's VM. CALL & Burn Her Words Into His Brain Cells. RT
Let's tell @SenateMajLdr how we feel about @SenWarren censor on Senate floor. His DC/KY numbers! #letlizspeak #CorettaScottKing #NoSessions 
@TheDemocrats @SenWarren @SenatorSessions  Coretta Scott King is dead.  Liberals relying on the dead as usual.
get out of Trumps way, so he can help USA, liberal Evil liars
actually a fair amount of Americans are tired of listening to her bs.

Remember when Chuck Schumer said, "Once you elect a President, he deserves his choices to run the executive branch"? I do.…
 Obama   "We simply cannot allow people to pour in, undocumented, unchecked". OUCH! 
Democrats don't think rules apply to them @muchmoresalt @marymg
 Breaking: Senators apparently unfamiliar with Senate Rules or are intentionally lying/disingenuous...more at 11.
