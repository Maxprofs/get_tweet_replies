Jokes on you I use boost

Still one of my favorite scenes. @FinnSkata did an amazing job as #mike . I cannot wait to see the gang back together. #Director #actor
This GIF will buffer until #Sense8 gets renewed for more seasons.
Actually no, Lana indicated a possibility for more seasons.
How do you know that? Do you search 'Sense8' to see all the new fans loving it every day. I made a moments page just to collect them all.
500k that made their voices heard, u mean, don't mean they r the only one watching. until Netflix gives official numbers, nothing is certain
You should have done this to a teaser for season 2, that would have ruffled some feathers
If #NetNeutrality stops will you pay the ISP i need you
This was so intense!!!!! I just watched the 1st season and it was awesome 11
Netflix streaming lags just like this
Imagine it 100 times worse
#NetNeutrality and chill.
this show blows
#Sense8
That's fucked up

I need an anime gif version of this... Maybe Seven Deadly Sins?
It's ok that show sucks anyway
GIFs don't buffer. Someone apparently doesn't know how buffering works. -_- Try not to sound like a numpty.
There are far more important things to be worrying over than being pedantic.
The fact that Twitter even exists, serves as proof to the contrary.
Net neutrality is needed
Why u make us suffer and wait so long for Stranger Things season 2. The kids will be older than me.
oh that's just nasty
This made me so frustrated at first without realizing they were demonstrating. Let's fight #NetNeutralityDay #NetNeutrality !!!
I find it comical that AT&T wants "net neutrality" with their internal rhetoric about net neutrality just making them "dumb pipe" owners.
If this actually happens I'm gonna do the same thing, with out water
If you live in rural america it does anyhow.....
I know that feeling way to well.
Govt control, like Govt mandated control AT&T, stops innovation
No, it protects the consumer
No it doesn't, it cuts revenue so no money for future advances like slow speeds faster then the fastest speed today
You’re wrong. Net neutrality is the most necessary thing for the internet to thrive
Govt control always fails vs Free Mkt succeeds
But in some cases, like net neutrality, it is necessary, as internet service providers will abuse the extra power they will get
So Free Mkt brings you the internet but you don't think you want to let it advance for your benefit which is the result of Govt interference
Free market, as always, is a good idea in theory only Private business just can't be trusted to do the right thing with that kind of power.
Proud of you @Netflix. We are always stronger together. #Sense8
DON'T DO THIS TO ME

KID ROCK FOR SENATE 2018

CRYIN CHUCK IS A LOSER

ya quiero verla esta genial soy fan de Eleven
Maybe if you leak a gif from the new season we could grasp net neutrality better, scratch that leak the first episode.. 
I'm pretty sure if this passes, the customers will scream and shout at internet providers.......I wonder if that will matter?
Lol. Netflix just does not want to pay for the bandwidth their content takes up. Leave #StrangerThings out of it.
But #NetNeutrality is so fucking important for everyone. This issue unites people on both sides of the political spectrum.
I am not sure there is unity; some Republicans are against keeping #NetNeutrality . Either way using a popular TV show is a bit much...
Yeah people working in government because theyre in the pocket of the internetproviders but regular people. Also this is an exellent example
Waiting for @HBO to do a #GoT slow-mo stream for #NetNeutralityDay
we already know what happens
@ccMixterMusic @Stranger_Things #RenewSense8
@phandicorn look it's jish
I  you, @netflix!!  We want #NetNeutrality
shoddy implementation.  It loops back to the beginning too early.

Tho having it "buffer" for longer would swiftly get to GB territory...

Bring back Lillyhammer!
Compare internet from before and after 2014, is it better? Get government out of internet.
Y'all doing the Lord's work. Keep fighting
THIS ACCUALLY HAPPEND TO ME WHEN I WAS WATCHING THIS SERIES 
I SWEAR TO GOD
Can we get an mst3k the return gif to buffer too? Because "In the not too distant future..." #NetNeutralityDay
Brilliant
@optic_walb0ng
Did you see this @PeytonWich
Now post on the main page a #sense8 gif!!!!
You've just earned so much respect
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
So is your preferential traffic deal with @ThreeUK cancelled if you're into #NetNeutrality ? #Hypocrites
Forget everything else Netflix and undo your mistake renew sense8 at least one more season the cast and writers deserve a proper ending...
rustle
well done
Think you slick boi
This hurts, I just got Netflix
Already made a deal! This graph shows how Netflix speeds changed after Comcast deal [Comcast Roundup]
@slondon23 Freaking brilliant. #StrangerThings2
Come to Australia, you get buffering 24/7.

STOP
Its good to see NF support #NetNeutrality today because they were one of the first victims of being bullied into signing a deal with Comcast
@martin_dix nunca mas la vimos
So there's one big bus that is expecting to profit from this hummm
OMG can't wait!!!
STOP YOUR OBSTRUCTION MR.SCHUMER!
 Stop  putting up road blocks TO STOP @POTUS!! 
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT RUSSIA WE CARE ABOUT AMERICA!!
Perhaps Obama admin shouldn't have given away the internet.
At least MST3K isnt buffering, netflix... right?
Meh. Theres life outside these walls.
If this doesn't prove the importance of Net Neutrality, nothing will.
And Sense8 is renewed for Season 3
@PUMA classic tennis shoes right there!
She'th our friend and she'th crathy!
Ironic, last I heard, @netflix had abandoned the fight.
Somebody should do this with Paul Rudd's Mac & Me clip.
#BringbackSense8 We want #Sense8 How about #MoreSeasonsofSense8
Netflix rules.

#WeWantTheKillingGameNetflix
Come on guys. Go get educated and let your voice be heard. I can't stand it any looonger.
Nice!
Then why did you pay into @comcast 's extortion? You should have fought it then.
They have a business to run, I'm sure they helped the cause to get it passed in the first place. But they still needed to keep buisncess
They should have made it very clear to all  that comcast,not netflix was the issue, the problem magically went away after they paid them off
The suspense is killing me. #netneutrality #strangethings
Ouch
#WeWantTheKillingGameNetflix pls #NetNeutrality
