#CNN always posts negativity toward our president. It's a disgrace. I am embarrassed that they are even a part of American journalism.

Putting country first
good for you, it is about time somebody stood up.
voters in Massachusetts should vote NO on Markey he's a DUD
Why doesn't CNN ever ask questions from conservatives?
GREAT ANOTHER BONEHEAD who will be replaced in Congress.  Kiss your seat (both of them) go bye....
@SenMarkey Thank you! Proud that you're my Senator
@realDonaldTrump@SenateGOP@HouseGOP
sen Markey did a great job answering questions. Thank you for your honesty.
Don't believe everything you hear. He was wrong on many issues. Tune into Fox News and see what was wrong, then decide.
Fox news is pro Trump with selective hearing. No thanks.
thank you @SenSanders @EdMarkey
who is Marky?
I hope he dies soon
All democrats should vote no. Stand up. Do your job
Good thing you don't matter! Thank you we will take 8 years.
Vote Senator Markey  out of office. He's not listening to the American ppl. We want change in gov. not more political opposition!
we need to raise the retirement age to keep the SS system solvent. I am 59. I plan to start drawing when I turn 70.
proud to call @SenJeffMerkley my senator!!
He's just mad they didn't give him some of the #California #Weed to smoke! That is the liberal way. Get stoned out of your gourd.
Sen Marley voted no I'M SHOCKED Please Earth to CNN it's not news. NEGATIVE NARRATIVE It's getting old.
@EdMarkey we don't need your vote anyway you career politicians wasting our hard earned $ think you can do anything you want NO MORE
that means they are the very best candidates.  Doesn't the senator  get this?

Dems have no say. Lost election and will loose bigly in 2018.
need repubs to vote no.
I listen to 5 seconds, 5, and realized this guy is a fucking clown.
Democrats the party of no
This guy is a clown.
Markey is a Democrat. Automatic no vote that makes no difference.
be a no vote, doesn't matter, welcome to being #irrelevant
The Democrats put Americans in this Hell hole called unaffordable health care. Selfish Elite don't understand how expensive it is.
WOW breaking news!!! A Democrat not voting for a Trump nominee. CNN very good reporting
trying to stop the train with a volkswagon
Hope no one wants to retire before they die if Mulvaney gets in.
Trust in God  you Will feel  good about  God Bless USA.

@SenMarkey Fully support your NO vote. May others join you

A No vote from a Democrat, surprise surprise. #obstructionist
@SenMarkey thank you!! Keep up the fight. #wecantgoback

Obama signed an Executive Order to pass the ACA in the 1st place. But now it's a big deal when an executive order is used to replace it
Ask Sen Markey what if the table was turn. What would he do to the other party
@SenatorMarkey Thank you!
To quote The Rock "It doesn't matter"... Who cares. Vote no they are both getting confirmed.......
if he is a democrat he don't matter
What about the MILLIONS of Americans who can't afford health ins now because of raising premiums due to ACA? Affordable my ass
as the DEM leadership orders:
fortunately for us it doesn't matter what he thinks
so the will still be confirmed.
hmmmm pretty sure that will have no effect.  Now find me a Repub who says that and it becomes news ? Get it #CNN ?
