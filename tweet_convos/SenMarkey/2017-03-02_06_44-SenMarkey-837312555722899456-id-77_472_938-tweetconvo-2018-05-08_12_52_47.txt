Yes. Yes she did recuse herself. Also, she did not lie, under oath, to Congress.  
@SenMarkey @SenateDems
AG Lynch stepped back from case to defer to the FBI

She also was not part of the HRC campaign and did not meet w/U.S. adversary on her behalf. 
@SenMarkey @SenateDems
No. I'm saying that he perjured himself for not disclosing mtgs w/U.S. adversary. There sb consequences
@SenMarkey @SenateDems
@SenateDems @washingtonpost we need an independent investigation on you and exactly what state you live in! You're a fraud!
@SenateDems @washingtonpost Sessions needs to stay where he is .  Democrats need to go . Your NWO is sick 
@SenateDems @washingtonpost all democrats need to resign . Nothing wrong with Russia . They're against NWO and that's good thing
also please trace Trump ties to the Russian fertilizer king, Russian banking, etc. I fear for USA
please get independent special counsel I won't trust it will be done the right way if not
Dont you have WILDLIFE TO SAVE?
@SenateDems @washingtonpost so did Schumer so he should resign too
You know nothing, and you and your so-called party should keep quiet and stop judging when there is no there there.  Sound familiar?
Push his resignation. He committed perjury.
@funder @washingtonpost Yes. Slippery to recuse. The sword barely touched his flesh. He needs 2 resign.
all democratic senators and congressmen should resign due to lies to we the American people
… hey Eddie!  How many foreigners have YOU met with?  You POS!
thank you!
@SenateDems @washingtonpost Back off Dumocrat...
@SenateDems @gregpmiller If Lynch took the 5th umpteen times & met w/LolitaBill on Tarmac to discuss #crookedhillary Y resign?
Thank you Senator Markey! Don't let up.
Thank you, Senator.
@SenateDems @washingtonpost This is complete BS even the post writer is backing off his story on this
.@SenMarkey @UniteBlueFL @gregpmiller democrats are communists
WHY has this NOT been done yet?
.@SenMarkey @UniteBlueFL @gregpmiller  
The democrats are communists
they all should resign! As it stands now, USA practically has no functioning federal government. 
Russia,Russia,Russia-yet 2 see hard evidence. Session sh go but not over Russia
@SenateDems @washingtonpost never had one with Clinton or Obama
If an AG is about anything it's about they shouldn't lie under oath. Sessions should resign.
He should be fired!
Question becomes, how did President Obama, force AG Sessions, then US Senator, to lie under Oath to Congress?
@funder @washingtonpost And you support the interaction that Obama and Hillary had with Russia over 8 years? #uranium sale, etc.
@JeffSessions he lied to congress, he lied to the American ppl and he lied to world. #ResignSessions
We want the truth regarding Trumps campaign connections to Russian officials. Special prosecutor needed right now!
Thank you for your integrity, Senator.
@SenateDems @washingtonpost investigate Hilary first
@SenateDems @washingtonpost Hypocrites! Hillary was a liar and a traitor. Lynch didn't quit or recuse herself. #fakenews
Dems still haven't figured out how they lost election. Honest folks watching their massive meltdown. Up in 18?
@SenateDems @washingtonpost U lie
more negativity sir. Your constituents in Ma. are watching.
Stop lying, stop hating America stop hating OUR president Stop your wish for a communist sharia Law U.S.
@SenateDems @gregpmiller 
And now to also investigate Sessions.
Thank you.  I am proud to call you my senator!!!
@SenateDems But do Dems have power to force resig. This is bordering on criminal act- you can't lie to a federal body can you? ?
Hey. Senator Man. What are you doing to make our country better? What's your plan for the next 4 years? Is it just to obstruct?
Perhaps obstruction will make the country less worse.  It's certainly a plan with precedent.
To be fair, why wasn't an independent council assigned to Hillary Clinton's private e-mail scandal? She definitely broke the law!
Just because comey said that there was nothing indictable, there were still several points of guilt.
On top of that, why did Loretta Lynch meet with BILL ClInton on the tarmack? Conflict of interest, and nothing was done?
@SenateDems @washingtonpost We need new elections. We need a fresh start.
delay is over! U launched a satellite program to cover ur conspiracy theory! Unlicensed unfit Duncan u arrest end in
life in prison. Access all before resigning! Failed to return the trust to properly. Now he bringing in warriors for
aiding terrorists acts of Waukegan community hospital corporations systems. Feeding into industry with insanity.©™®
@SenateDems @washingtonpost prosecute
@SenateDems @washingtonpost Resign is right. Not just "recuse."
Sessions needs to resign. Once again he's doing nothing but sowing seeds of discontent and distrust.
@funder @washingtonpost I'm old enough to remember Ted Kennedy asking the Russians to interfere with Reagan. You're a hack.
I voted for you & I don't understand or support the Russian witch hunt. Want to "get" Trump? Focus on his business conflicts
when your AG commits perjury, he doesn't belong in the DOJ. He's corrupt as the rest of them! He can't be trusted!
why not work for the country instead of this witch hunt had 8 years vacation get to work already !
Get the non partisan investigation behind us-so then they can get back to work.
sad to see some people here putting party before country. There was obvious collusion with Russia on this election. Awful.
@rfelty @washingtonpost 1980 US "Miracle on Ice" team needs to return all gold medals; there was "definite contact" w Russians.
Let's expand to look into Subversion and Espionage by last administration including Obama, intel community  & YOU
he should resign, too many questions at this point. An investigation will do little, even if cleared. Too late!
these people are just right of their talking out both side of their mouth can't trust what their mouth 
Since you never called for a special counsel for Hillary, you're really nothing but a lying hypocrite.
How about you resign first Senator Malarkey?
Thank you Senator for standing against #Sessions& the trump regime! We must have an independent investigation into Russian ties
Hillary and Uranium One first, OK? Or are you just another lying hypocrite?
Ed from Maryland, do this country a favor and resign. 40 years in CONgress is all that is wrong with government. #CronyCapitalism
Thank you Senator for standing against #Sessions& the trump regime! We must have an independent investigation!
