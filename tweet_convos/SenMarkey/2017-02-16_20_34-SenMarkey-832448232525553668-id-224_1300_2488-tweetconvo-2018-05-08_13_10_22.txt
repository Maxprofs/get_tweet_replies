True today! #ImpeachTrump
@SenSchumer HRC #Benghazi think about it, Benghazi deaths on HRC Liberal mentality
you are a crook
i think it's time to SHUT DOWN THE GOVT. that is what GOP would do.  get tougher Dems! 
@SenSchumer Strange how Democrats considered whistle blowers should be jailed-but not when they are proving what Clinton did??
@justHardisty Why is it that Trump keeps appointing ppl who basically oppose the purposes of the agencies they're supposed 2lead?
does it not seem intentional?!With THAT many?!!!...
It's uncanny, huh?
No way he was going to EVERRR release his taxes!!!!Who actually thought he would?4 even a second???
@SenSchumer maybe they have been wiped with a cloth ?!?!
Based on the confirmation hearings, I don't think you know how to read, much less ask questions about Pruitt emails.
@SenSchumer obsessed with emails?  We were obsessed with Our National Security. Get it right.
PUT A HOLD ON THE SUPREME COURT NOMINEE SEN , PUT A STOP TO THE GAME PLAYING .
I believe the word you're looking for is hypocrisy.
@IsaLeeWolf or Trump's taxes
@SenSchumer Hypocrisy reigns supreme!

We also insist on seeing PENCE's EMAILS. Because he himself felt there was something to hide, in them.
For two years the American people have been hearing all the reasons why emails don't matter.  What happened to change your mind?
yet they vigorously investigated anyway. Hypocrites now not doing job.
truth and the reality the Democratic Party is dead as well as the Republican we are Retrumplicans MAGA
Clearly psychology wasn't your major, that or you skipped to many classes!
BC you know that she is guilty! Hope you dont know anything about it or they will be coming for you!
@SenSchumer no vote on Pruitt until those emails released & reviewed. His record is dismal, he cannot lead EPA. Evidence builds.

that's fucking funny! There's treatment available for both hypocrisy and insanity. You might have to look up those words.
now you're just being a troll in Pennsylvania how fitting
serioulsy America is tired of the political games cut the crap and start working
@SenSchumer LMAO, maybe you can ask WikiLeaks to get them for you.  BAHAHA
@SenSchumer The DNC is obsessed with degrading Trump
glad he is equipped. He will need it
@SenSchumer   Keep calm and wait 8 years.
hahahahaha! Over many dead bodies, Bannon
Hillary is crooked and that's why she lost. We really dodged a bullet.
@SenSchumer you will lose re election
leaked emails from the bathroom illegal server by a lady who was responsible for the death of 4 solders?  Just checkn
@SenSchumer payback time. This is so much fun.
that's funny, but you won't do that for refugees and illegals , but are willing to violate citizens rights
Unbelievable. I'm truly troubled by this double standard.
@SenSchumer ha! R u kidding me? You will get Pruitt when we get Hillary's
@SenSchumer That's how you describe your lying Hillary problem?? And her enriching herself with selling uranium to Russia!!
When does the Left start looking into the whereabouts of the Hillary Emails?? They're more scandalous than Pruitts.
Give us hillary's Blood on your hands when truth comes out all you senators should be prosecuted for Murder
@SylviaZ1913 Pointing out GOP hypocrisy is too easy. You need to get right up in their faces and make them eat their words.
@SenSchumer we never got Hillary's emails did we? I guess when we do then you'll get what you want
#crookedGOP
@dijames1145 @SenateDems @SenateGOP #PostponePruitt & do what you do best #HoldHearingsOverEmail
oh give us a break. Clinton was a Gov Official using a private server for Gov business to include classified info.
@SenateGOP @SenateDems #BigOilMoney #Earthquakes #ExecutionDebacle #WaitForFOIADocuments NO on Pruitt !!!
@SenSchumer when we hear the Senate call for removal from office?
@SenSchumer US never before has faced a greater threat. Unfit for office. Impeachment, 25th Amendment or Emolument Clause
GUARENTEE:  Tomorrow Pruitt will have been confirmed...AND..tomorrow you will ALL still be total obstructing IDIOTS!
@SenSchumer polluting Pruitt? Gee, creative. Compared to 34.0 missing by sec state? Bad comparison

@SenSchumer 
"What difference does it make? "
@SenSchumer don't wait for emails. Vote NO on Pruitt for his inhumane record as AG n for being in bed w big oil #impeachtrump
#Dems have been denying email issues for yrs but are suddenly interested. It's all politics and you're all $hit!
Funny how roles reverse. #Hypocrites everywhere. Why do you care about emails? You haven't cared about emails for yrs
Thank you for your efforts in pressing on to obtain answers. Answers all of us deserve to know.
@SenSchumer.  Stop the obstruction.  We are not paying you to make delays. The president needs his cabinet now
How about Clinton's emails? Where were you back then?  Can you say hippocrate?
no to mention insecure cell phones and ties to Russia.
@SenSchumer we have a dictator traitor in the White House and facists in the congress
@SenSchumer 
#FAKENEWS MEDIA
Pres Trump got a big heart when it comes to illegal children. Alt-left and Dems are lying to you. 
@SenSchumer Are you going to take action? This dem is growing scared and frustrated by the party... fully investigate, hearings
@SenSchumer #Democrats #SnarkyMarky When the emails were classified & put national security @ risk,yes the there is a difference
@SenSchumer - tred carefully. Next time it may be your email we insist on reading.  I'm sure Schumer has skeletons in closet.
@SenSchumer - two years and still more than 33,000 Clinton emails never seen.  And she wasn't running for EPA chief.
Genius, you didn't care about Clinton's email and what she was doing. Quit the whining and fake outrage. Can you get Chuck to cry
go back on tv & cry your a fraud
@SenSchumer
Why is the #GOP so hell bent on destroying  our country ? @SpeakerRyan  @POTUS  @marcorubio  @JohnMcCain  @LindseyGrahamSC
@SenSchumer not obsessed OUTRAGED at the blatant criminality of obama his cabinet and liberal democrats. Progressive fail!
@Fired_Up_2016 
Hypocrites liars and cheaters living off the backs of The Working Man.
DoTrump supporters understand all this
or Trump's involvement with Russia.  "Very Bad."
is our air really your concern or do U ow favors to some 1 that can get more money out of middle class WHAT ABOUT THE BORDERS!
@SenSchumer Do your job &stop with all your lightweight BS. You lost the presidency & both houses! Keep it up
@puppymnkey or pence's
@SenSchumer COMPLETELY different situations and you know it.
@puppymnkey Pence is trying hv all his past emails classified under natl security. U better find out why-fast! B4 he's takes WH
Hypocrites much!
@SenSchumer Sucks when that happens, doesn't it? It is however, much better in the drivers seat.
Hold up EPA vote until emails are released!
@puppymnkey   We are not allowed to see Pence's emails either.  Something he doesn't want out?
Will @LindseyGrahamSC & @marcorubio take responsibility 4 loss of coastlines?? @postandcourier @MiamiHerald #RejectPruitt
@SenSchumer What's good for the goose is good for the gander...
as I said, they're electronic files, not stone tablets. They should be available in seconds. It's a delay tactic.
@rsalt159 This is sick how different a man is treated over full throttle treason v a woman and emails. #ImpeachTrump #DoYourJob
Confirmation not appropriate until he complies w/ OK ct order
@SenSchumer I love Ed Markey. Keep it up!
@SenSchumer email scandal!!!
Don't give up; we can't fix what abandoning EPA will break
@SenSchumer of course! Because they are hypocrites & work for the rich
In other words, it was NEVER really about the emails. They're shameless hypocrites. Stop #pollutingPruitt
was clear from the Get.  For them, the end justifies the MEANS.
@SenSchumer what difference at this point does it make? Govt won't do anything just like the Hillary incident. You're all asswads
@SenSchumer Pence is hiding emails too.
@SenSchumer oh now emails matter!  We want to see Hillary's email but what difference does it make at this point! It still does.

deny and lie. The new congressional motto. GOP are beyond disgraceful.
and trumps going down. Will never make 2020
@SenSchumer were Pruitt's emails also classified secret?
and IC against him. Will expose treason
@SenSchumer We all know the vote will continue so Sessions has to run any investigations, which he will refuse to even start.
an honorable world leader, unlike the repugnant we have
we all know how that REALLY turned out
@SenSchumer   Nobody cares about the email she was never hacked ,. Let move on you old people 
Hypocrisy is their only remaining principle.
Did those e-mails involve impropriety by US SecState in the careless processing of the nations sensitive material?
you know what's treasonous? Talking to Russia many, many times during a campaign and then lying about it for months. 
how can they do that????  so now we can just IGNORE the rules/law?  i don't know why I'm surprised, Trump has been all along.
Definitely an oxymoron..waste taxpayer money on  6 investigations into Benghazi w/same results-Hillary NO wrong doing
"What difference does it make?"

Intelligence is the Enemy of Trump Supporters. I like this game!


is this where I post the Melania nudes? Because I think this is where we post her escort pics.
@SenSchumer  It will be unconscionable if the vote is taken before those emails are released.

to report TREASON, call any person who understands what the constitution is!
@SenSchumer Failed delaying tactics to stop @POTUS's cabinet is reaching pathetic levels

Drama Queen Schumer appreciates your support. Keep it up!


@SenSchumer

@SenSchumer please stay diligent, Senators. Please! The American people deserve and demand it
@SenSchumer it's sad witnessing the blatant hypocrisy from these people. The world is watching and this election has consequences
