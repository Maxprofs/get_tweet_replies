@freepress Please don't use that term.  Use the real term, White Nationalists or Neo-Nazis.  This matters.
Stop lying 
@SenMarkey @PIE20121 @realDonaldTrump
Wow, you sure went 180. Sad.
I have never supported calling people racist. @PIE20121 @SenMarkey @realDonaldTrump
You're pathetic. Probably always were.
- Trump needs to first banish all the hate coming from the Democrats and their liberal cupcakes.
One white guy, out of all the jews he picked, and you all freak out? You only want 100% Jews?
OH BUT THE RADICAL LEFT IS PERFECT FOR AMERICA ? RIGHT DOUCHE BAG.
#ThePeoplesPresident
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump The Alt-Left and the left in general has been horrible for America, police yourself & your team 1st
Thank you! <3
embarrassed to call you my senator. This is the exact hypocritical identity politics that go Trump elected.
Agree with everything you said. But your use of the term 'alt-righ't only empowers the Bannons. They are racists.
There is no ethical way to negotiate w. him as long as he is appointing anti-Semites & proposing discrimination.
Except for enclaves of liberalism on each coast, America has rejected the Obama administration&his sycophants like you.
As MassDem & worried citizen, I beg you to provide leadership & guidance for MassDems seeking to restrain Trumpism. Help us!
Thank you Senator for speaking out. Our president needs to speak out against hatred of any kind.
PE Donald Trump needs to take lessons from Sen. Markey on leading with class.
as one of your constituents, thank you.
Thank you for your clarity of vision.
Thank you @SenMarkey. If you want to unite us, @realDonaldTrump, don't divide us right at the beginning.  Bannon has no place w/a POTUS.
THANK YOU for your attention to this issue!
. @SenMarkey but @keithellison is ok as head of dnc? Disavow his ties with Farrakhan
U may have bullied the right for years, bt your blow-hard bullshi** is over.No one is impressed or intimidated by any of u.No one
The more you throw at #Trump the stronger he gets. U progressives will never understand that he has the pulse of America.
...and r responsible 4 the war on cops. None of u have repudiated the violence of the vicious/racist #BLM . #TraitorousLeft
U may fool ur constituents bt those of us who understand leftist ideology aren't fooled.Obama/his lackeys have fomented race war
Wrong again. Progressives have kept blacks on ghetto plantations/caused loss of jobs/dropping incomes/encouraged racism/division
Donald Trump will make his own choices, not you! Bud out, it's not your decision.American's trust Trump!Not YOU!

Donald Trump spoke to American's standing for the Constitutional Rule of Law! We won, YOU LOST! Now stop whining
#ThePeolesPresident

You never learn. He is not alt-right, we see thru you propoganda

@StephenWunderl4 @realDonaldTrump He can't they own him now
@anylaurie16 no make @realDonaldTrump publically embrace the KKK + the American Nazi Party. That's Trump's mess.
.@SenMarkey needs to banish Bannons of this world from his administration. White supremacy is all-wrong for America.

DONALD -TRUMP IS THE ALT RIGHT ! AS WE LIKE TO CALL WHITE SUPREMASISTS BIGOTS THESE DAYS !
@ar1511c @realDonaldTrump I applaud you sir for standing up and speaking the truth about this purveyor of hate and fake news.
the alt left has run amok for 8 years, shut the hell up @SenMarkey @realDonaldTrump
Massachusetts needs to banish you. Breitbart is a right leaning Gawker, not the KKK newsletter.
@chelseaperetti @realDonaldTrump I am sure if New Balance could UNcongratulate Trump they would, No to H8, Un American.
@chelseaperetti @realDonaldTrump proud to call you my senator!
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump how right you are!  He's "the keeper of the inappropriate comments" for Trump
@chelseaperetti @realDonaldTrump looking for your Fire Jarret speech. Cant find it
The alt-Right is part of the coalition that WON.  They EARNED seats at the table of power.
You are my personal hero & I respect what you did today, but @realDonaldTrump appointed Bannon on purpose. What is that purpose?
@chelseaperetti @realDonaldTrump could've sworn his name was @edmackey11
@chelseaperetti @realDonaldTrump stop. Obama destroyed your party . Take a seat for a while
@chelseaperetti @realDonaldTrump STFU!! Trump rules!!
Thank you, Senator Markey!

(And, @realDonaldTrump? We ain't kidding.)
THANK YOU for standing up against bigotry and hate
@SenateDems @SenMarkey @realDonaldTrump Let Trump work and mind u our own business.  SenateDems are not in the majority for a reason.
ALL AMERICANS ARE WATCHINGEVERY JUDGE& EVERY COURT! TRUMP MUST BE PROSECUTED ON EVERY SINGLE INDICTMENT NOW!
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump we need to come back to the center from the far left push of the last 8 years..
@SenateDems YES! NEVER GIVE UP! NEVER SURRENDER!
that's what we want to hear. Speaking up & standing our ground. Dems who don't have our backs, won't get our votes. Unite.
@SenWarren Geez, my 2 senators are wasting valuable time & energy that could be spent bettering MA
we really need to focus on removing the ice cream man and the fake Indian.
seriously, don't you have more productive things you could do besides this pathetic grandstanding?
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump saying alt-right normalizes these white supremacists.
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump He doesn't listen to anyone! Bannon shouldn't be anywhere near the WH. Washington needs a purge.
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump
just stop it! You and other Dems are creating division
The Democrats are creating division? You do know that Drumpf pandered to the racist & ignorant  right?
among other items the Dems were hiring people to create problems at rallies. Yes they are creating
Reynold's or store brand?
now I understand why there is so much division... starts with people like you who name call
Name-calling? What, you don't like people calling you out on your ignorance or racism? That's rich.
division starts w/name calling which is what you are doing. You are part of the problem not solution
1)Hey, you voted for a man who has told the nation to not be PC & to have thicker skin. And you're
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump Everyone should have a voice. Even the far left. Who the he'll are you to shut people up?
