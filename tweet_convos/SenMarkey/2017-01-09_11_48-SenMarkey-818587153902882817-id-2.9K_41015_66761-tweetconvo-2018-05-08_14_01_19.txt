That's what you call a sick burn.
I'm LOVING my Senator right now. Go Chuck!
 “#BarackObama in 2008 on #HillaryClinton corruption ” 

The video was not hacked by Russians.
How wonderful that you've awakened from your coma! I hope you're sitting down... Hillary lost! Now we talk about PEOTUS Trump!
kim. Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.
Jack.  HRC is irrelevant in this discussion.  Trump is the most dishonest, unethical president ever.
And that's before even being sworn.  Imagine how bad it'll get on Jan. 21.
We're counting on you Sen. Schumer. #MakeAmericaSafeAgain. Please.
The best- "There, I Fixed it" I have ever seen!
keep up the good work, sir
@brianefallon @SenateMajLdr if they try to ram them through. Ask for tax returns and go through them line by line
. Sweet troll there, @SenSchumer. Keep it up!!
can we impeach our rep maj leader for ethics failures? Clear now what purpose of ethics dismantle was about.
@SenWarren @SenateMajLdr Great job Sen. Schumer. The way we see it from out in the Country...No need to lower to bar.Good work.
please do not settle for less!!!
so so good
@kurteichenwald @SenateMajLdr 

Stay strong on this Senator Schumer...we're counting on you!
Great job, @SenSchumer!
Stay  focused!  No hearings before checks!
Please DO HE HAS FORGOT HAT HE SAID
Thank you, Chuck!!
Thank @SenSchumer
How did that go in 2009?

sore losers, I was thrilled when you took the helm from the lyin crazy man Reid, pls don't disappoint with more bs
Don't let McConnell get away w. this hypocrisy. These r most compromised Cab. nominees in history. Need vetting.
@SenGillibrand CS: thanks,! We need leaders like you! KG: still waiting for you to #resist!
Senator Schumer,
Please attach this letter from Senator Cooper, got Mitch out of going to Vietnam.
#FortunateSon
you may also want to accompany each tally with a meme or visual aid, so they understand what they are being asked.
@andrewlong166. The above comment was in addition to yours. 
haha 
Well done Minority Leader Schumer!!
Make sure you include that when things didn't go the Dems way back then that they changed the rules for themselves
THE FORCE IS STRONG WITH THIS ONE!!! 
bahahahaha! Love it!
McConnell may think all Americans are dupes but WE REMEMBER what he said and want him held accountable.
Do you remember when republicans made a pact to obstruct the President on everything
Not all republicans are on board with his picks, regardless were not going to just chill
@scottymac003
Ok so where does it end? Republicans are shitty people therefore democrats have to be shitty people? That's 5 yr old's logic.
@hippiemama2002 @SenateMajLdr I LOVE YOU Mr. Schumer!  Please fight for us!  Save us please!
That's right Chuck, both sides of the aisle need to be flushed into the sewer.
We LOVE u, DJT will vociferously fight u but u stay strong because u hv MILLIONS behind u, not him. DJT is inappropriate.
i am here for this exit
Thank you 
If you don't vet
We won't forget
That's not a threat
You're just our last bet
Our last safety net
Support Schumer #notmyprez
Thanks, @SenSchumer! You're a pro and some of us appreciate professionals doing their thing.
@SenWarren @SenateMajLdr Gee. How far down in the trash bin did u have to dig for that document?
Dear Mitch, put the country before your party and do the right thing... Impeach @stephenbannon to show good faith
brilliant!
Only problem is...this was sent 2 weeks AFTER inauguration.  Why you jumping the gun on Trump?
It needs to be done before nominees are confirmed which Trump has chosen to start this week.
Untrue...check Wikipedia.  Some hearings began Jan 13th and confirmed in January.
The point is they need vetting before confirmation.  Ethics committee sent letter saying they need docs
Playing games with this letter then.
No just want to remind McConnell of his words back in 2009.  No confirmation without vetting.
*edit
Americans in majority are watching and making a note of every action you take. #TheResistance
this is excellent Mr. SCHUMER! Keep up the good work fighting on behalf of the American people!
Paper trail... I love being on the right side of history. 
Thank you @SenSchumer.
I made some changes, so it is ready for @SenSchumer's signature. 
Nice one Senator.
Every senator should do this. Print out these letters and tweets and blow them up on the senate floor.
I said the same thing to my wife
Because you're a smart person.
Please do not waiver, the integrity of the Senate is at stake. @mark_rice_ @SenateMajLdr
He can articulate the hypocrisy of @SenateMajLdr's position. @SenSchumer
really not the issue here #ethicsmatter
you r off topic right now. What u r saying is absolutely true, just not germane to this particular current thread.
dare i say that chuck schumer just showed the receipts?
I think he read one thing about him . Has nothing to do with what the adults are talking about . Hush
Has nothing to do with the voting part.
They are just asking for them to check out these people before it gets to the point .
Mitch the Bitch getting slapped. Feels great hey Mitch!
This was great @SenSchumer!!!  Hope @SenateMajLdr Understands this action and will do better!
Long-standing & eminently reasonable @SenSchumer unless Congress makes exceptions 'cause Trump has the blessing of Don King, Putin & Yeezy.
and the American electorate
the American electorate voted against him. He didn't win by getting the most votes. @jfreewright @SenSchumer
what ? he won the most states. Hillary just won big in California.
states aren't citizens. He won because he won votes in right places. 75M people voted against him. @jfreewright @SenSchumer
After years of (R) gerrymandering, VoterID restrictions, limiting voting places & days...
What comes around, goes around. Touche' Senate Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer.
I hope you sent it, just like this.
@RepAdamSchiff @SenateMajLdr #OK #GOOGLE #WHO #MADE #THE #POPE #RETIRE
Because I made the pope retire.

 #competence
@Sirstu1 @SenateMajLdr this will make no diff. Dems need new strategy bc Repub dont care about diplomacy. Time to get down&dirty
The utter hypocrisy and epic disrespect the GOP exhibit will forever taint their legacy. #hypocrites
Q: who is being disrespectful? A: Democrats. Tolerant, accepting until you disagree w/their ideology.
Absolutely... use their own words. They can't fight that
they'll just be like Trump and have Kellyanne do that FOR them.
LOL.. and messing up big time.. same coffee we call it in the NL
Very well done.  Hard to argue with that without looking like a two faced turtle.
Thank you. Keep the heat on!
Very good. May I suggest you recast these 8 standards as running tallies with a check mark (or not) next to name of each nominee
...And repost the list daily, as you refrain from agreeing to Senator McConnell's time management?
I don't know how anyone can remain a Democrat now. You can vote for Democrats but not be one. Embarrassing
I don't get what you're saying.
Well played sir!
Well played indeed!
I tried to connect with Senate Majority Leader McConnell to express my opposition to the dismantling of the ACA. Mitch isn't taking calls.
We are with you Senator Schumer! Do the job you are paid to do McConnell! Put our country before your damned party
hahaha, really almost as funny as Amy "Leather Special" Schumer.  Fail.
Brava!!
Thank you @SenSchumer. Currently  @SenateMajLdr is impossible to reach by phone. How can citizens make their views known? Don't skip ethics.
call him at his local office
That's BS since his decisions affect us all.
there has to be more in the file we can return.
Conspicuously absent are the reams of comments from the MAGA riff-raff, as tends 2b the case in the face of undeniable hypocrisy @SenSchumer
@Veronica @SenateMajLdr Looks like unmitigated obstructionism by Schumer and Dems I have no patience for them. Move along.
so, exactly what the republicans for the last 8 years.
1-@Veronica @SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr Not really. Dem r asking 4 proper procedure-Repubs just obstructed cuz McConnell hated Obama
Oh, I don’t disagree.

Please keep those cards and letters coming #RecycleandReuse
I am loving @chuckschumer with this move, I mean is the reps held to a different standard?
@PaulBegala @SenateMajLdr LOVE IT!!!!!
Maintain the standards or go down in history as being the party to ruin the Republic.
it's like parents that smoke telling their own kids not to smoke. Keep up the good fight!
Don't give the time of day to @realDonaldTrump or his GOP henchmen! #Resist
I'm curious, did Dems honor the requests in McConnell's letter back then?
Great! D's are standing firm, not buckling under pressure, demands from MajLdr. Much respect for D's.
stick to your guns...dont let these verkakte hearings go through!
Now that's real Brooklyn, Senator Schumer! Go at 'em!
: stuff like this is why we NYers LOVE YOU. You make us look good sir!
Yup
CREATE LIST of GOP actions &inactions. Advertise the GOP's created new precedent 4 2018
Thank you for fighting for every American and our democracy!
So Schumer, "WHEN" are you going to get around to actually 'vetting' oboma.....???
Remember when you pretended you were actually going to follow through on this and fight for us?
@Sirstu1 @SenateMajLdr Repub don't care for our Country just their power!


@AnuAnzu @SenateMajLdr we all know Trumps a rule breaker so why change now
thank you for calling out GOP hypocrisy. Please continue to do so.
is it better served cold?
Thank you for continuing to fight for transparency!
Great Job !!!
#excellent
Exactly Right !!
thank you
Thank you, senator. Keep up the good work!
You, go, Chuck! Great way to give it right back to Mitchy-poo!
First light at the end of the tunnel since the election. THANK YOU for this.
Would like to have been in the room when McConnell open & read this letter.
Thank you @SenSchumer for demanding that proper vetting be completed before confirmation hearings are scheduled
thank you Sen Schumer for all that you do . You have 100% of my support.  Democrats need to dig in.
What he said !
What's fair is fair.  What u wanted is what we all want
Sick burn @SenSchumer.  Now hold them to it.
Our requests are eminently reasonable, shared by leaders of both parties. I'll return this letter to @SenateMajLdr with the same requests. 
We the people will not stand for your stall tactics.  You are a political thug w/zero respect. Don't stall !!
How many of Obama's were held up?  Do you think @GOP agreed with policy or that POTUS gets their team?
Well done, sir. EPIC troll! 
And stop hanging up on us when we call. Especially if you don't want us on your doorstep tomorrow.
WTF?
@scipioroad @SenateMajLdr Have a fantastic day.
Well played, @SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr
Thank You! Let's have the same standards for ALL nominees regardless of party.
this is how the government gets the receipts  using their own words against them, im crine
@SenWarren @SenateMajLdr at least you request. . All your friends post demand after demand. Put your opponents on the offensive
hypocrite!!!
Yes, that's a good thing. If they are not vetted, kind of like the GOP's pick for prez, we don't want them
Note the date of Feb 12, 2009. What's the date of the first hearing? Rush job?
Brilliant!!!
If ur 2 old & out of shape 2 handle the meetings...find another career. Or find out what @realDonaldTrump does!
thank you
Chuck you are AMAZING!  @SenateMajLdr
Fine idea, Sen. Schumer. Thank you!
@MitchMcConell I'm sure he will give U the same respect u gave him
Sen Schumer 2020
.@SenSchumer make sure Don The CON is a One-term President or is impeached, whichever comes 1st. @SenateMajLdr #JeffSessions @CoryBooker
@kyleighhewett
Thank you Sen Schumer, proud to call you my Senator!
 As 1 of your constituents, I'm cheering you on and urging you to keep at it. Looking forward to response from @SenateMajLdr
Thank you Senator Schumer!
El Cártel de Trump y Putin
@puppymnkey @SenateMajLdr all GOP
amazing trolling of 2009 Mitch McConnell with 2017 Mitch McConnell
keep up the good fight. Don't give in ... ever!
thank you!! Please don't let up on them. We stand with you in the fight against injustice!
Please get those giant boards from Bernie and plaster these all over D.C. Tomorrow.

Well played Senator Schumer. Well played. #GOPHypocrisy
Hahahahaha! Nice 1 Chuck! I won't hold my breathe u continue this brave stance against GOP. Plez prove me wrong.
THANK YOU Sen. Schumer 4 standing up courageously against corruption&hypocrisy #MitchMcConnell et al. represent!
thank you but damn I wish you could filibuster!
Don’t punk out on this. Do it.
#holdtheirfeettothefire
Perfect!
well done! Thank you!!
@SenWarren @SenateMajLdr #Trump S president. Stop being jackasses and get along!! #DemocratsForTrump will never return to #DNC
WE WANT THE SAME... AND WE DON'T WANT THE SHAFT
Thank you, Senator - PLEASE be relentless. Merciless, in protecting our democracy.
yeah baby. Enough with the lies, why don't these guys have to be vetted. What makes them special ?
@TimothySandefur @SenateMajLdr I'm curious, what was Mr. Reid's response to Mr. McConnell?
DEMS have to stand up to Bullies like @SenateMajLdr! Hypocrisy at its best! #GOPCORRUPTION
That's hysterical,
Who's the clown now?
We're counting on you
to hell with this letter to @SenateMajLdr. The USA might be putting a Russian agent into the White House. LOOK INTO THAT
Thank you. The American people are with you. Fight for us and we'll fight with you
You should cockblock just like the  @SenateMajLdr did for the last 8 years. What comes around goes around, right Mitchy? #evil
What's good for the Goose, is good for the gander!
@quinten488 @SenateMajLdr It's time we stopped fighting and bury the hatchet. Fake pundits and Hollywood royalty want to rule
lmfao ok Chuck you win this round.
Keep the pressure on. #ThanksChuck
@kurteichenwald @SenateMajLdr  thank you!
From this point on, all of my children and pets will be named Chuck. #ChuckSchumer #Savage #DemForce
.@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr 

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!
I thought that was rather brilliant in its simplicity.
... You got pwn3d Mitch
is this true?
Nice idea ! tit for tat !
couldn't write your own letter? This is childish
you do not mess with a New Yorker! Take them all to school, Chuck. Cheering you on.
@SenWarren @SenateMajLdr be strong.  I've never seen such stupidity coming from the Republican party.   What a bunch of idiots.
@realdonaldtrump
Also, hiring son in law is federally ILLEGAL!!
HYPOCRISY is the fuel of the GOP! #crookedgop
point: Schumer.
W to the O to the W. Long term memory coming in handy for ya, Chuck?
trump should release his tax returns, can you release them for us?  How about Wikileaks?
.@SenSchumer -- well played, sir.  Well played. Please continue to #ResistTrump
Thank you for standing up against unethical behavior (not to mention blatant hypocrisy)
thank you.  Fantastic.
thank you. Delay hearings until full ethics picture is available.
Americans expect no less. thank you.
Go get em @SenSchumer
nicely done, Sir.
