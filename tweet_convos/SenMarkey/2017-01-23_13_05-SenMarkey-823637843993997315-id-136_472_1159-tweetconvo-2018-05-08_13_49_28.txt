Americans need assurances from #RexTillerson that he will put American interests ahead of #BigOil's interests. #RiggedCabinet 
@SenSchumer @exxon Mr. Tillerson's response was a good one.  Another too long serving congressmen holding up progress.
@SenSchumer @exxon So You don't support Tillerson,  however you did support Corrupt Obama for 8 years
@SenSchumer @exxon Every member of Senate / Congress has family or friend with business. Do you all recuse yourself?
try to penalize or trying to ruin this man's reputation cuz you fools don't have same high standards as him is
You're not my senator but good decision. You did the right asessment & concluded what the American ppl think.
Obama gave $221 Mil to Palestinians his last day Dems don't have any room to talk! anti semitic pro muslim.
unlike you 2 idiots this man held a J O B with same company for 30 years that's called loyal hard worker to
@SteveSnyderSF @exxon Abaolutely shameful!!! Thanks for standing up for us!!!
Who would you support? @JohnKerry
Will you join @SenMarkey and refuse To put @Exxon in the cabinet, @SenSchumer? Or will you vote yes like you did on the first 3 nominations?
So why retweet this, Chuck, when you then voted to accept #RexTillerson for State? You need to show strength!
@SenSchumer @exxon Would expect nothing more from Mr Markey whose history has always been poor political Dem posturing.
thank you for standing up for our country and it's best interests. You get it, Tillerson/Trump don't.
You're an ethical man, sir. And thorough
Don't vote for any of them.  You'll be guilty by association.  You know none were picked for their knowledge or experience.
Really?! Knowledge and experience?.. Career politicians it's nothing but a servant to their own interests first! Historically
Loose the "T-Rex". 
If confirmed it's Grand opening of "Trum..putin...assicPark"
@SenSchumer @exxon then you will be voted out
I am one of your constituents from lunenburg ma. Please do not vote for Rex Tillerson. We know where his allegiances lye.

@GeoffreySupran @exxon Thank you Sen. Markey. A blocker of action on the climate crisis has no place as Sec. of State.

If @exxon gets oil then Russia loses net income/US wins. Americans J-O-B-S!! Ask WJC: "It's the economy @SenStupid!

@SenSchumer @exxon Tillerson should NOT be in ANY government position!!!!
Thank you, @SenMarkey Your allegiance to the American people is duly noted. The Reps betrayed the American people in favor of corp $
@SenSchumer @exxon I don't know why anyone sees u as a leader in this party. U let how many Dems confirm a Trump Nazi today?

@SenSchumer @SenMarkey @exxon This does not come as a surprise.
@SenSchumer @exxon So Tillerson has made it abundantly clear that Exxon comes before his position. Sad!
