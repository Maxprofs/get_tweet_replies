oops potus likes pancakes boy cott pancakes potus likes water libs hate wata
when is @SenSanders going to actually do something on his own? @ChrisVanHollen @tedlieu @POTUS
yea cuz you globalist servant bagmen traitors know what's best 
Trump is far too unstable to have free reign on nuclear launches!
thank you
Well that was a useless article... Waste of my time!
just take away codes from 45, all will be well.
it's ok, the codes are more than 140 characters in length - he'll never cope!
@Macska4Earth @SenSanders @ChrisVanHollen @tedlieu Thank you!
u continue to be a full blown donkey wow eddy it's epic w ur lib group
Only in your minds. Trump is probably more level headed than all of you together
Thank you! @SenMarkey @MellodieYsmay44 @SenSanders @ChrisVanHollen @tedlieu @POTUS
Hate to tell ya this, but it takes more than 1 finger from more than 1 person too
Once we've been nuked; retaliation will be a moot point, don't you think?
Does it matter who hits the goddamned button first? No.
Hope the person with the football got a gun!!!
He's busy taking pics with people at mar-a-Lago
"Scary"
Republicans would rather see the world burn
You  forgot about Hillary's private server with classified files the Russians hacked.
I worry that telling toddler Trump he can't push a button will make him do it.
Obama could've disarmed. Instead invested billions to overhaul nukes.
Dems already went nuclear w/new DNC chair Tom Perez.  We're doomed and you are lost.
ah yes. Leave us defenseless. Not the sharpest tools in the shed...well you are libs
interesting that Franken opposes choice for poor children but his children are at a school of HIS choice

Good bill.Thank God the nuke protocol doesn't allow 1 person to launch.
Well...I it's a start
The real question is-Does #45-@realDonaldTrump possess a psychologically, sound mind?
Frightening!
Please keep dump from playing with any buttons
thank you senator  Markey for the good work you do.
Trump and Russia are systematically disassembling our government.It's time to wake up
Pls. hurry!
A much needed bill to protect us from an unstable man with questionable loyalties.
Disgusted that it took you until now to consider it.








THANK YOU @SenMarkey @SenSanders @ChrisVanHollen @tedlieu @POTUS
schizophrenic with his finger on the twitter... I mean trigger
seeing that he can't even spell a 3-letter word ("tapp") he'll probably think the Launch button says "Lunch".
Who knows how many lives were just saved. Thank you
I hope it passes.
Yet the Democrats are looking at what with Russia? War?
Yes please!!! We need to wait until they nuke us first #manners @SenMarkey @SenSanders @ChrisVanHollen @tedlieu @POTUS
NYT failing fake news
obama legacy the all time worst democrats will never recover
democrats scandals just keep giving
Good!!
Why didn't you pass this in 2009?
@shortybizzzz @ZainaErhaim @neiltyson  OUR GRATEFUL THANKS FOR THIS Bill, @SenMarkey @StephenUCS @SenSanders @ChrisVanHollen @tedlieu @POTUS
Yes to this.
@POTUSI hope all Congress is willing to personally kill Trump to protect us from bomb
call Iran for approval first Mr Ed. Protocol
what's 2 worry? @EPAScottPruitt  says nuclear fallout is perfectly safe 
: Does the Donald know what it would mean???
Pls investig8 CIA (=Russia fingerprints) 4 rig'n Primary & GE @NoBigGovDuh @SenSanders @ChrisVanHollen @tedlieu @POTUS @nytimes
So you're trying to take more power for u? Sounds about right! #hypocrites
when & where was that statement made? Look @ the facts before saying something.
25th Amendment Time.  @ChrisVanHollen @tedlieu
Yes, lets wait for the enemy to nuke Congress first, then POTUS can respond. 
who believes NYT?
Thank you very much! Please protect us from Trump!
Smart, thank you.
another mad men with button in his hands
At least Trumps fingers are tiny and he might miss the missile launch button
terrified that this is a actual thing.
There are safeguards. He can't just push a button.
Safeguard? = Glock 17??
so you really want us to wait for congress to act? you guys can nvr get anything done
thank you
this is the dumbest thing I've read today, restricting POTUS emboldens enemy
.@SenMarkey @SenSanders @ChrisVanHollen @tedlieu @POTUS Trump is clearly not mentally stable enough to be in charge of the nuclear codes.
Somemore obstructionist work by you Bernie and the Dems that a way. # Berniethe
Thanks!!!
Thank you!!!
I remember as a child under 10 yo. 1965 Adults saying middle east should be a parking lot.
Not that you would care, but that term is offensive to families of developmentally disabled.
With any other President I would be against this, but under the circumstances...
Look on the "Bright" Side half of Britan new the "Secretkey" 000000000 ;) (QI)..
Oh god yes!
I was reading On Thermonuclear War during the election. His ignorance is stunning.
Trump didn't even know what the nuclear triad was during campaign.
yes, I remember yelling at the tv.

'Fuck, I should just run for president'
And we thank you for it!
how are you going to restrict him when his staff can't get him off twitter?
So grateful to my Senator Van Hollen for helping to limit Trump's nuclear finger!
Thank you, Senators!
