<< is a coward.
@Kasparov63 @realDonaldTrump I didn't vote for the man but how about we judge him by the job he does after Jan. 20.
time is not nearly as limited as your options. He won election.
you are in denial.
@ChiTownSports @realDonaldTrump 
I don't give a single fuck. 

"Get over it, you lost." - Barack Obama
At this point it has nothing to do with the election
It does. He's been elected. Legally. Stop listening to #FakeNews.
Especially since Trump treated Obama so nicely after he was elected
Well Obama treated America like a diaper soooo...
So what? He tried to bring down his Presidency using 'fake news'.
fake news spreads disingenuous information about conservatives and President Elect Trump.
It spreads lies. Exactly what Trump did
Really?  The chaos is stirred by snowflakes asking for them. In ALL honesty- why does it matter??? Give me 2 reasons...2 solid reasons.
#ICareAboutTheTaxReturns
Ron, please work with colleagues in the House to start Articles of Impeachment.
#ImpeachTrumpNow
@Lawrence @realDonaldTrump yes yes yes! He said he would - but now will likely hide behind some exec privilege doctrine
@ananavarro @realDonaldTrump less than 2 hours and only 24k. see no one 
Please click to vote- Do you think Trump should release his tax returns?
https://twitter.com/NSyracusetwit/status/819223511617204224 …
Release tax returns NOT under audit.  No one has asked for the one NOT being audited!!! Someone!
RT if you think that Retweeting is going to accomplish absolutely nothing
Donald Trump needs to reveal his tax returns to the American people, as his predecessors have.
Well first off, it's not a law as no President is required to show his taxes, they've just done in the past. But if you're that concerned go see Rachel Maddow at MSNBC, LOL. As she tried to reveal one of his tax returns and all we found out was that Trump overpaid that year, LOL
YES!! Trump's Tax Returns SHOULD BE RELEASED!!
Trump's returns are no one's business but his own. Let's see yours, snowflake.
We need to see his tax returns! There are reasons he is hiding them! Bad reasons...
honestly I don't. They are literally the least of his problems. Don't let him distract you with this.
I bet people can care about multiple things without being distracted.
nope. No fucks given. On to important things now.
,
Send me your street address in private. You will have driveway, walks & roof snow shoveled by this evening. #ItsTheTaxReturns
Make William Henry Harrison the 2nd shortest serving president in U.S. History
Why would that matter now? He's already President..How bout getting rid of 16Amend instead.
@HJBenjamin @realDonaldTrump dont care about his tax returns. Why do you think youre "entitled" to them? #notrequired
Wellll, It sounds like you're hiding something David.
#auditschmaudit
still dont care
Why?
lots of irrelevant things  are best left uncared about
If the Black man or Hillary hadn't shown their tax returns,  I'll bet you would've cared ,BIGLY
oh i doubt that
@Eloise73728831 @realDonaldTrump heck yes! Time for Caligula to #disclose #TaxReturns
Thank you, Sen. Wyden. You're a gem in this huge, massive mess. And, Pres-Elect: I most certainly care about your tax returns. Am NOT press.
Actually incorrect. If private company does your taxes they have the right to sell info. Don't agree. still true. & #POTUS tradition thx
If a company has done your taxes, they can legally sell your info as no HIPPA for tax docs. POTUS release precedent since 1960s w- Romney.
I care about @realDonaldTrump 's tax returns being shredded to bits, dumped in a hand basket, & dropped back down into hades where they came from!
I care about then being revealed. So we can all see more evidence of crimes. His GOP tax plan to benefit the wealthiest can be shredded to bits & sent to hell in a basket. Then after his tax ret's are revealed, they can be shoved in cold storage (tightly locked up) ...
for future evidence if needed, then eventually dumped in tiny bits down to hades also. Oh & that after 45 is impeached and/or indicted, whichever comes first. Hopefully soon too.
Not really,  just like when Rachel Maddow tried to pull out one of his tax returns and exposed that on that particular year, he actually overpaid his taxes! LOL. She completely embarrassed herself & her fake News Network, and everybody agrees about her idiocy, even some Democrats
Of course we care, but Trump isn't a fool to release it now. He won't in 4 or 8 yrs.
Retweet if you care about @realDonaldTrump's tax returns
Are you seriously still wanting the tax returns?? Wow. Plz share why u care.. can't wait to hear this @srkeller1992
#RussianBot @RonWyden @realDonaldTrump @srkeller1992
Yawn. Go worry about something important. Quite doubtful you’d understand them if you saw them, other than as fodder for some inane smear.
And reply if you don't care.  @realDonaldTrump #IdontcareabouttheDonaldstaxreturns
You're a lawyer and don't care? What if he is lying about Russia.

we must NOT reduce the tax on the top 5%. Low income &  middle income & upper middle income are unfairly burdened
I care about your tax returns. You launched CDA the same time the #Backpage Child Sex Trafficking Syndicate was launched. You have stood in the way on #SESTA legislation knowing everyday women and children are the collateral damage. You are protecting #Backpage. Tax returns?
Kinda. Wish the IRS would finally take him to court over his tax returns....FOR ALL TO SEE. 
A year later, I’d still like to see them.
We don't care get a life and stop the crap we don't care about Pres Trump taxes
Exactly, like I just posted, just ask Rachel Maddow about his taxes, LOL. I'm still laughing from that day when she tried to expose one of Trump's tax returns where he actually overpaid that year, LOL She looked like the biggest fool on National TV embarrassing herself that day!
Meh. I care more about his collusion.
@DanFastenberg @realDonaldTrump #ICareAboutTheTaxReturns
#ICareAboutTheTaxReturns
but didn't care about the delay for Obama's BC? #PartisanHacks
1 has been released by every candidate prior to Trump. 1 has never been requested of a single candidate other than Obama.
But tax returns are not legally required, whereas, Natural born citizenship strictly IS constitutionally required.
Agreed. And the evidence of his citizenship had been sufficiently addressed. That's how one gets on the ballot.
.@GlobalWorkforce @PhyrexiaNewborn By Pelosi? That gives me such confidence. His grandma, dead now of course, witnessed birth in Kenya. 
You make my daughters and me so proud of our state! 
Thank you, Senator Wyden.
Ron, Are you against shutting down sex trafficking websites? Why are you still representing the people of your state if you are?
What do you care about his taxes, we know he pays them, we know he is wealthy, and he is President, what's the point? Get over it
Hell yea.
.@RonWyden @realDonaldTrump I expect to see Trump's tax returns. As an American and an Oregonian, I'm asking you to hold him accountable.
I'd be more worried about a representative of the people, who doesn't want to shut down sex trafficking websites. Trumps taxes did come out.
NEW LOW GREED
Trump ends 3.50 surtax for invt saves 6 figures yr on Mar-A-Lago Club in FL. 
We lose 700 billion Medicaid decade, holy terror
I don't. He won. Let him govern.
I agree with you. They want to go on a fishing expedition & Trump isn't going to allow it
I am not a reporter, merely a humble citizen of the USA & I desperately care about Trumps taxes & interest conflicts
Learn to live with it, there is nothing anyone can do to force him to release them & the topic is getting old
I worry more about the precedent we set. I don't want future candidates to think they don't need to show their taxes
I understand your concerns but the precedent is already set. It is not legally required. Nobody can make him. Elected anyway.
What if in 4 years there is someone running on Dem side that won't show taxes, will u object to that?
NO, I have the ultimate respect for the law which is why I abhor @HillaryClinton
I wholeheartedly respect ur opinion, do u mind if I ask u if u have always voted Republican no matter who was running
Time to see tax returns of all applicants for federal jobs. Pres, Veep, Cabinet, everyone.
Really? I thought it was time when Obama sealed nearly every record of his life
@HRobertHuke @realDonaldTrump What button do I press if I don't?
Understanding his holdings and who he does business with seems important to me. Would like to know if he's putting country before Trump Inc.
Im pointing out that "RT if u care" doesnt allow for an alternative view to be heard. Should have "Like if u dont care" also
I hear what you're saying. I guess I'm looking at the bigger question: shouldn't we care? I believe it's an important issue.
It is important, but if he really is being audited, then the returns aren't really final yet, so I get it-for now.
Hey trump, we DO care very  much! Come clean. STOP GASLIGHTING & SHOW YOUR TAXES! What r u hiding???
Why don't you try holding your breath or maybe a hunger strike.
Win, after Trump is POTUS,all U Trumpets will B put on a hunger&healthcare strike
You are just silly & ignorant.
ok, let's talk in 6 months.
Let's, He has done more since election than Oidiot has done in 8 years
Don't care at all, doesn't make a bit of difference.
I damn sure DO CARE!!!!
Let's see the tax returns ...NOW. Or let him resign for unspecified conflicts of interest.
Wyden, there are a lot of vile and hateful dems, and you certainly in the running for the worst of the lot.
@donnabrazile @realDonaldTrump why does anyone believe his tax returns would be honest?
Nobody really cares!
2005 returns where shown he pays 33 percent in taxes and gets audited every year.went thru his returns to see if did business with Russia
I care deeply about the unseen tax returns. If years appear where he did NOT PAY tax, I want to know.
An Oregonian and I don't care a bit. Why are you focusing on nothing burgers? What about rampant drug use in Oregon and my healthcare prems?
how many yrs did people ask for OBama birth cert? You were an OBama rubber stamp! Dbl standard
We need to see his tax returns. Not next month, not next week. Now.
You know, I don't. I figure IRS, FBI will act if necessary. Meanwhile, you killed CISPA, and here we all are w the Russian hackers
@waldo027 @realDonaldTrump what will it change? You harp on all the minutiae anyway.
we will know where his true loyalties lie.
I follow you to see what sort of domestic/foreign policy you are in support of.
please continue to demand to see the president tax returns
give it a rest Ron! Show us yours! I would like to see how Congress members making 174k yr and all millionaires!
Obama realized no one in Congress would "second" the nomination so he just skipped protocol and gave it to himself 
Pig...
No...SLUG!
I care!
This interests me.Like2Know Y it was OK 4Hillary,IRS/LL, Cmills2either plead 5th,"Don't  recall,know,remember",yetSessions cant say same?
He won't show. His supporters bought the lie.
another Tax Birther.
nobody gives a fuck! Where are your tax returns?
@thekleptocracy @realDonaldTrump thank you Ron for being a great senator! #oregonvoter.
Hey Ron. News Flash. Nobody cares!  How about you get some work done for America that matters.
@hodgman @realDonaldTrump I don't care about them. If he does his job & does what he said he would do, I could care less about it.
@tkdmike @realDonaldTrump We need to see these now before the 20th
@kerrywashington @realDonaldTrump Show his taxes!
Ron wyden let's see you're tax returns. Will you show them or hide them?

I care about Trump's tax returns very very very much!

@theextendedmind @realDonaldTrump I care about auditing the whole gov. I want the 20 trillion back to the people.

What button do I click to not care
Move on 2 more imp issues affecting ur constituents. Need help? See @SenJeffMerkley 
Yes I do care about those tax returns!
stop trying to brainwash people. You do realize that your children's generation won't ever retire right? Why?
@SenMarkey @realDonaldTrump Podesta asks should we hold emails between Obama & Hillary? (From subpoena)

Every day since before the inauguration and every day till he's out. (Shh but Mike Pence is terrible as well)
#showusyourtaxes #Trumprussia #russiagate #transparency
@jeanmarh20 @realDonaldTrump Ok Ron there is the support. Now go get them!
#unhinged
MY family has been a Democrat Oregon family all my life. I'm ashamed that I ever was.THE corruption is astounding
Amen.
Kellyanne in her previous life.
@jjgills1 @realDonaldTrump hell yeah we care! What is he hiding... #fraud #collusion
How about if YOU care so much PASS LAW that would require ALL elected representative to produce them! Taxes = NOT required / B.C = REQUIRED
I really really care. And I care that it was promised to us. And we all know you he's lying.
LOL Retweet if you think this is a dumb tweet..Are you counting
He will choke on his own words. We don’t need to assist him - he seems really good at it :)
YES I CARE !!!!
does it make you sleep at night that we have an Obama insurance card I can't sleep because no one accepts it
I don't
This is what we care about: We came across something that tells us that all the Senators and Congressmen and Women are aware of the facts of
amazing that Obama had to produce his birth certificate but Trump doesn't have to show taxes?
@GlobeBobRyan @realDonaldTrump  They are none of my business, yours either.  Can I see your tax returns?
@SenStabenow If there is nothing to hide, could restore faith in people. R&D Thank you for asking -- represent.
I still care!
Retweet if you want an explanation for this:
Don't buy incrementalism. It's code for: "we can't figure out how to do this & keep taking re-elect $ from the oppressors."#MedicareForAll 
No. But I do think term limits are one way to stop ridiculous tirades from @RonWyden.
Where's yours?
No,I'm more worried about my tax's,healthcare,jobs.I also worry the Dems are destroying the country.Dems have changed
Nobody cares about POTUS past Tax returns. We care about jobs,safety,our children's school. What have you done to help with at? Do your job!
Retweet if you could care less about Trump's tax returns but plan on voting against @ronwyden

I care about the tax returns. We have again been lied to by the PEOTUS.
Not just yes.  HELLLLLLL YES!
@BruceBartlett I also care about how Trumputin has physically deteriorated the past six months. What if "no tomorrow" for him?
More leaks wyden sorry I called you a fool: too high a status.pathetic-you are the smell
I care about Trump tax returns and all his other financial dealings.
WE live in a capitalist country and what a person earns is no ones business but their own.
true in Somalia perhaps, but the US should be setting the bar higher
their tax returns! I mean what the hell does he have to lose?
@CTJaddie @realDonaldTrump  I care!
We care about the tax returns!
I care - so do 70% of the American people -which means we don't care - "see alternative facts".
No are you joking?
Tax Returns will reveal a cesspool of corruption- Has 2 much 2 hide-only revealed if he is forced.-thanks Ron
Absolutely! @realDonaldTrump, show your taxes, your finances. Show us why you are seemingly more loyal to Putin than the U.S.A.
Hey Donny, this tweet has over 119,000 retweets. America wants to see your taxes.

#NeverTrumpHillaryism! Suddenly [No #SinglePayer Insurers/Anheuser-Busch Darden/Dow/Google] everybody loves Wyden
You should care more about Dems sorting their own house, so they can legitimately challenge the Repubs in the future. Stop losing.
ONLY you Progressive Marxist Socialist Dimms keep deflecting away from the corruption on the left.  A page from Alinsky?
now you should have a retweet on who doesn't care.
Oh yah shan't to see what he is hiding! Follow the $$$$!
@GlobeBobRyan @realDonaldTrump 
I, for one, don't care. He's rich like JFK. That's all I need to know.
I don't care if he paid taxes, I just want to make sure he filed them.  The IRS doesn't play around.
<-----is a LIAR when he says only MEDIA cares..He has only 37% approval rating going in 2 WH. #FNC
You said you's share them if elected... still waiting!
Much more frightened by #ObamaGate spying on @POTUS & his people.  #SusanRice lies constantly to cover up lies & deception.
