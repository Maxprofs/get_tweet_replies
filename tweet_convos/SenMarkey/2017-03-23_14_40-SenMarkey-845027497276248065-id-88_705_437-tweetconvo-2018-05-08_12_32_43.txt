U.S. Senate votes to overturn Obama broadband privacy rules http://reut.rs/2mVfogK  
@wdclac @GOP The same people who dont want the government requiring u buy health insurance are ok with selling away our privacy!
@SenSchumer @GOP TOAD DEMOCRAP
Thank you Trump Voters.
FCC Chairman...said consumers would have privacy protections without the Obama internet provider rules...Somebody's lying
except your dog whistle favorite of "racism" would be tooted if Obama was.
@SenSchumer @GOP You mean the way the IC has been spying on all of us & unmasking names whenever they felt like it? #ObamaGate
@SenSchumer @GOP  GOP = Greed Over People
@SenSchumer @GOP This levels the field. Google Facebook Yahoo Twitter were less restricted. Now it's all the same. GOP win.
@bejaha @GOP Hiw do we get the @SenateGOP @HouseGOP records. I want to put them in the @WSJ
There the GOP goes again Making America Great Again and protecting Americans.
@SenSchumer @GOP kind of like the FIVE agencies that get all our info from Obamacare? No difference. We have been enslaved NEway
Infuriating!!!
- Let's repeal this law before #Russia buys our information for more cyber attacks @FBI look! No hacking needed!
@SenSchumer @GOP Unacceptable!
Circuit court rules changed by Democrats. Tell the truth.
@SenSchumer @GOP that's already being done genius
This is an absolute violation of our Constitutional rights. They are chipping away our Democracy.
@ThomasJ17762016 @GOP I guess it comes down 2 which fire seems more dangerous at the time. Losing health care for 24 mil,BIG FIRE
With a straight face? Obamacare database was hacked numerous times already and you never informed us about it. ASK THE NSA.
@anneli8012 @GOP I guess someone thought that would be a good idea.
but you're ok with FISA courts, spying on Americans, unmasking of names, and other ridiculous violations of the 4th Amendment?
.@SenMarkey @GOP Terrible-I should have sole say who shares/gets my info; all info harvesting/sharing, incl. by google etc, should be opt-in
@SenSchumer why is @GOP so willing 2 sell USA for fiancial &political gain?  2 make us powerless &make them richer by dictators
@SenSchumer @GOP Corporations are people my friends. Does this include all Senators and their staff?
@SenSchumer @GOP Disgusting
@SenSchumer @GOP @RandPaul @SenateMajLdr thought we were about the people? Stop selling us to corporations or things will change
@SenSchumer @GOP umm not trusting any if Obamas stuff anymore.
Did they get it passed? Oh my God! I hope not!
@SenSchumer @GOP privacy rules have always been there don't be an ass
@SenSchumer @GOP why wasn't this filibustered??? Dems need to step up and protect us!
@SenSchumer @GOP Excellent! Hopefully, I'll get some good offers.
@SenSchumer @GOP this is SAD. @potus needs to veto if it gets to him. Nothing good in this action. Just like stealing from folks
This is not good! I don't like anything about the Trump Administration!  To much lying, I don't trust them!
@SenSchumer @GOP Money makes the devil dance .
Let me think...Russia just hacked our computers & GOP think our data shld be sold?  Common sense says NO! Idiots
@HowardBeck @GOP easy fix. Buy politicians search history, make it public for everyone to see. It'll be overturned in moments.
My first thought: this is going to come back & bite them in the butt! And it'll probably go viral.
Great.  Just what Americans have asked for.  Said no one ever.
@SenSchumer @GOP Why?
@SenSchumer @GOP What reason could they possibly have to repeal this other than it was an Obama thing.  GOP needs to grow up!
@SenSchumer @GOP My question is why!
Why is the GOP interested in leaving the American people that vulnerable?
$$$$$

@jorge3763 @SenMarkey @SenSchumer @GOP
@SenSchumer @GOP good God, does the GOP do anything positive for the American people?
@SenSchumer @GOP is this a go or still being fought??
It is all about big business. The land of the consumer home of the all mighty dollar. We the people my @$$. We need to limit terms
@SenSchumer @GOP just another example of the #CorruptGOP The American People are for sale to them.
@SenSchumer @GOP Newsflash!  OBAMA Intel already has all our private info! Remove your blinders!
@SenSchumer @GOP What possible benefit does this have for GOP constituents? Ugh
@SenSchumer @GOP Who actually believes that this wasn't already happening? Not me.
@SenSchumer @GOP This bothers you, yet all private texts, emails, etc. collected by OBAMA Intel orgs is no problem? Disgusting!
trump trolls will never hold GOP accountable.  Advertise Dem solutions.
What else is new? The GOP appear to consider their dark money as the only important Americans. SAD!
@SenSchumer @GOP Why would they do that??? Thanks a$$holes
SERIOUSLY?!? ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. IS ANYONE ELSE SICK OF THE IDIOCRACY THAT IS IN WASHINGTON THESE DAYS?
@SenSchumer @GOP some of us r sick of subsidizing the entire world. Not Obama's $ so he didn't care where $ came from #whatajerk!
.@SenMarkey @SenSchumer @GOP I'm so glad they did.Just what consumers want is being snooped on by the very company that sells you internet.
@SenSchumer @GOP Than @POTUS needs to stop crying about wiretapping & leaks #resist
@SenSchumer @GOP anything to make money @GOP you are morally bankrupt
@SenSchumer @GOP then let's first start w/ @potus taxes
@SenSchumer @GOP I hope that includes the GOP also.
Thats why they don't care about TrumpRussia spies
@SenSchumer @GOP Shocking anyone would vote for this. Insanity reigns.
@SenSchumer @GOP and who benefits financially from this theft of our personal information??
people are too paranoid about their information being used for marketing.  Most are not that interesting to be concerned
@SenSchumer @Reuters everyone that voted for this should have their browser history and personal data shared publicly
More importantly what does the government do with the information it illegaly gathers on citizens ?
@Reuters 
SHAME
@SenSchumer @GOP such #LIES do you #Democrats ever tell the truth??!
@SenSchumer what do we do?
@SenSchumer @GOP disgraceful move by GOP, they will pay at the polls.
@SenSchumer @GOP
what exactly r u proud of? Did he pee pee on the potty or something? #DontheCon has done nothing
@SenSchumer @GOP That is infuriating!!!!!
This is terrible. Is there any reason to do this traitorous deed other than to line their own pockets with lobby cash?
Just another example of @GOP 's loyalty to corporations instead of their constituents civil rights.
Which is why I'm not a republican. I don't always agree with Democrats approach but at least they don't screw U.
