This Sen is out of his mind.
OK OK, OK. This is easy. Feds make a one time $1tril. HC investment fund. Mandate the states provide single payer HC of choice. Done!
Government will take that HC and use it just like the SS.
Bull!! Time for them to stop the prescription drugs!
Shameful Class warfare period - not surprised by the Kathy Griffin, Johnny Depp, Stephen Colbert, NYPublic Theater type speech
