hold him to it! Keep the pressure on!!!
What a crock!!!!! If they do away with it, people will refuse to pay into that fund!!
@SenSanders Mulvaney is a moron.  Stop his nomination.
Trump breaks promises in the next breath after he makes them. If GOP fascists touch SOC.SEC, they're done. Get LOUD, Democrats.
@SenSanders oh my god. Can't we impeach him. He's a maniac he will ruin this country he will kill people
SS is our money, paid out of our paychecks, it is not for the Republicans to steal from us. They are taking enough already.
I think we should join forces! Imagine the number of people who would stand together.
@SenSanders where did he get all these greedy  nuts
Trustees forecast Old Age fund depleted in 2034, Disability in 2023, & Hospital in 2028 on current course. What's your solution?
vote No no no no no no no no

He won't do it, @POTUS will stand by his word.
Haven't you figured this out yet.. #trumps in it for the fame and $$$ You, his voters mean NOTHING NOW #wakeup
He won't do it.
Americans paid into SS Medicare our working lives.They're #NotEntitlements!  Or we should declare Moratorium on paying FedTaxes
You certainly have a way of putting words in people's mouths. And if we keep going like we are, there won't be any SS.
This country will revolt if they cut SS and Medicare. That is the last straw.
let's hope..
My parents live off of SS, they cut that, they are homeless. :/
@GOP  if you touch medicare or social security,  me and 100 of thousands of seniors will be very angry. Anger breeds action.
And 100s of thousands of young people will join you.
steve & his boomer friends are going to drain the fund. They'll be nothing left for you & I
we boomers had a big chunk of every paycheck taken for ss. We paid for it!
interest reflecting what that money could have made me if invested. Welfare my ass!
America has been duped by Trump. A nation of idiots. Senate Dems fail to provide leadership. You have failed progressives & your voters.
@saithethyme Geezers will march w/pitchforks if SS $ Medicare Are ended.
@SenSanders 
Bernie, you know the real problem and the American people need to keep hearing it. The drug companies are thieves.
LOOKS LIKE DEMS ARE LAYING DOWN FOR REPUBS ON NOMINEES. FREE PASS CHUCK? TREAT TRUMP LIKE MCCONNELL TREATED OBAMA. 2 MUCH 2 ASK?
@SenSanders social security is not an entitlement
Really and truly we already knew he had know clue what the He'll to do we America in his hand and now he's playing with Amercia.
@SenSanders already lost everything from the last recession, now this?
,Will he really listen .Trump is a billionaires Bully to the American people and the World.
Break his promise? That would come natural to don. That would add to the growing perception of him as dishonest. I am fed up!!!
I'm calling, writing - we are scared out here.  And I know you are listening
GOP and Optics in Chief will just spin them a story. Idiocracy in real life. Dems enable and quiver. Sad
.@SenateDems seems @realDonaldTrump breaks promises himself, no surprise he hires others to help keep him dishonest #PinnochioInChief #POTUS
@MartinHeinrich keep your hands off social security folks.
this is exactly the photo I would expect from a Trump supporter.
let's see how you feel when that little federal job freeze starts messing with soldiers...you might start getting why I am.
I've paid into Social security all of my life.  Give me back what I put in - short of that...there will be hell to pay.
@SenSanders Dems need to stand together and block!
@SenSanders the trumpster needs to be brutally honest right back at ALL republican bastards that want to cut social security...
because we know that Trump listens so well to ppl?? 
Republicans should step down immediately. #ImpeachTrump
Please stop these horrible men!
@MartinHeinrich we are going to hold Him accountable. Millionaires in his cabinet and the rest of us will have little to go on
cut social security and watch how fast you leave office
please do not confirm anyone who will reduce Medicare or SS
, please fight for our SS &Medicare.
Liars and cheaters are the republican shame on them
unfortunately this is what Trump once to keep people poor, while the rich stay rich. #RealHungerGames...Rick vs. Poor
And then, what? You'll all vote for him any way? #DoBetter
@SenateHSGACDems yeah fat chance on that. They have ALL got to go!!
Then lower Congressional salaries and health benefits. @SpeakerRyan
These buffoons know that they will get voted in, so why not just state true intentions. #SenateHearings
@realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan well Trump is just a TOOL for the GOP and will sign anything they put in front of him...CLUELESS
@SenSanders Of course Trump will
Get ready for the closing sale at the Democrats Plantation!! Republicans to freely acquire ALL #mediocrenegros @seanhannity #nba
@SenSanders I'll believe it when it happens. Politicians have gone back on their word and broken their promises far too often.
Roosevelt is rolling over in his grave!
@SenSanders why is there any surprise, of course this is going to change. GOP have waited a long time to do this.
@SenSanders impeach trump
Try to take my Soc Sec - EARNED benefit - you'll have to pry it from my cold, dead fingers. @realDonaldTrump @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP
@SenSanders gotta love the uneducated
@SenSanders Please don't vote for this guy either!
REVOLUTION NOW! No more NICE! STREET FORCE,REBELLION, IS ALL THEY UNDERSTAND!
@SenSanders No! Get back the money Dimon, Boehner, et al stole and lock them up. Social Security is NOT theirs to touch!!!!!
@SenSanders If Mulvany touches SS, Medicare, or Medicade, pretty sure the Revolution they've been trying to start will. Careful.

We almost overthrew the gov in '68; they may leave us no choice. Not my preference, but there's a lot of guns here.
I have no experience in any government job but I just know I would do well. How about a job like one of Trumps picks?
@SenSanders
Thanks Debbie Wasserman Schultz for inflicting this monstrosity upon the American People, our society, & environment
I'm shocked, I tell you. Shocked.
totally flabbergasted. Shocked. Whatever...
talk about a revolt. Saturday drove him crazy but this will be huge and that not an alternative fact.
@SenateGOP Please do not pass Mulvaney!  My life & my husband's life depend on Medicare & Social Security!
@SenSanders Thanks, but no thanks Rep. Mulvaney.
@SenSanders How is this a surprise Republicans have been trying to end SS,Medicare and Medicaid for ever and Trumps a Republican
do NOT pass him!
@SenSanders Thank you Lindsay Graham for showing your true colors to Americans who paid into Social Security and are starving.
sweet Jesus what is wrong with these people?
@SenSanders Tim Price wants to cut $1trillion over the next 10 years. Vote repubs into office and what do you expect.
one more time Democratic party and small r Republicans Do you feel the Bern yet?
@SenSanders Remove the deduction cap on the rich instead of making the elderly and disabled suffer
Bullshit give up your pension and medical We paid for ours!
wtf do they think promising something means?  this one got him elected and could cost the house come the midterms.
I am glad I know the Lord
@SSWorks Vote him OUT! Show up 2018. South Carolina Seniors it's about your lives. Regardless of your party!
I'm 62, been on SSI since 2004. Filed too late for SSD. Take a cent of my check, I'm dead. Will mean war, I have nothing 2 lose.
@SenSanders If the wealthy paid their taxes, wouldn't be an issue. If I pay 30% in taxes, so should they.
@SenSanders funny how the only way to get out of debt is to cut benefits for the poor.
get tougher
@SenSanders God Help Us!
@GOP  @NYCSeniors #seniors please don't take this threat to our lively hood without a fight. Get angry. Write/call your senators
@SenSanders pay attention America #NotMyPresident #RESIST #InjusticeBoycott #Medicare
@SenSanders republicans don't care about American people only ideology.
Dems should be blocking not cooperating in any way.
@SenSanders they need to have All of their benefits stopped!  No pensions-like the rest of us. No medical-same
Ask George H.W. Bush how taking the advice of a cabinet member worked for him in breaking a campaign promise? "Read my Lips..."
FBI Director James Comey says president asked him to stay and he agreed http://usat.ly/2kpfJqP  via @USATODAY
@GOP @SeniorOnline Seniors, time to get angry, please show your outrage at the GOP plan to gut social security and Medicare.
Wake up America.Trump and his band of thieves,are now stealing from you personally.
. @SenateDems Trump needs to be declared insane and his administration dissolved and a new election held!
@mame6432 @SenateDems I agree on the insane part, but there would not be a new election, Pence would take over. He might be worse...
dt is so unstable I worry about the wars he will start. Impeach and Midterm elections would hold pence
. @mame6432 @SenateDems @drwear Pence is vulnerable, in my view.
. @SenateDems Maybe his insanity is dementia? The symptoms certainly seem to fit! I'll be filtering (cont) http://tl.gd/nnd1bf 
@SenSanders this is stupid
Liars!  SS comes from a different pot of $$.  This pot would have a good surplus if the repubs would quit borrowing from it.
. @SenateDems The greatest bait and switch Presidency in history! Voter's remorse yet #Dinwits ?
@SenSanders Every Democratthat votes to confirm this guy needs to be replaced next primary. This is what Rs do when in charge.
maybe the Trump voters actually want to feast on roadkill in their twilight years
They'll do what they want, and spin it however they want and most seniors will believe it whole-hog.  They know it, you know it.
at least POTUS nominates individuals who aren't afraid to tell him the truth.
@SenSanders protect our Medicare and social security
@SenSanders 
Sorry Bernie but I think the House and Senate need to lose their benefits until they learn to appreciate them
@GOP did any  politician watch #WomenMarch the gop is in for a yuge #backlash #voteout
I'm Shocked!
You mean the 1% wants to "privatize" all those IOUs into Wall Street deposits then skim 'em off?
Gasp!
NO, NO you can not let this happen. He is going to make us a poor third world country.
I have a 93 year old aunt in a nursing home. If @POTUS breaks promise, he's answering to my family and all of us. Fight this.
@SenSanders I guess he's tried to kill all the working-class people? How do you run a country without workers?
there u go , they don't live in our world why not cut some of the pork out that gets attached to everything that passes
@SenSanders why are we paying SS taxes if we won't get it?
Hope you remembered to set your clocks back forty years.
@SenSanders @POTUS  not acceptable.  Cut corp welfare, see the wealthy are really hurting these days.
nobody that has been paying attention believed him anyway.
Great!  The American people are really getting it! Keep looking out for us, Senate Democrats!
are they though?
this 1/3 a sissy from S Carolina hasn't a care for anything accept the endless fraudulent funneled funds from the MICC.
@SenSanders disgusting. This is not welfare, its money that has been paid in, in order to protect one in their senior years.
SSC IS A BOND YOU DONT MISTAKE IT FACTS INTERNATIONAL BANKERS ELITES
@SenSanders great.  So how will he deal with all the seniors on welfare when they can't pay for medical care or food?
@SenSanders OK, no problem, let's also discuss defining good strategies for controlling baby-boomer rioting.
@SenSanders he will tell the gullible senator from the great state of SC anything he wants to hear to get that vote
Fight to keep our social security and medicare.  It was a promise that they would not be touched.
lets save taxpayers some money by cutting benefits and salaries of congress and high level gov. officials
HANDS OFF SSI! Waht money does the government have invested in SSI? ZERO. You stole over $1trillion & never paid it back.
God, I hate the republicans! @GOP
He lied. He never intended to not cut medicare and medicade. Conservatives are fools.
Things that mean nothing to Trump:  promises, integrity, honesty, democracy, women, human rights, civil rights, environment...
Any REPUBLICAN who hurts SOCIAL SECURITY should be set upon by all the VETERANS and their families those morons harm
Everyone holding office needs to remove "Hon." from their nameplates, no longer applies.
For years and years you work and pay into social security and medicare and in one vote of the @GOP congress - it's all gone.
GOP looking for every way to enrich fat cats and corporations while taking back from average Americans
REJECT this Jerk!  I have paid into SS for years; not his money to take!
To late! They took the $$ already. Now they want to end Soc. Sec. so they don't have to pay it back.
@SenSanders go for it. Dissolve both. But you pay me back every dime I paid into them over the last 20 years...
@SenSanders breaking promises is not a hard thing for Trump to do.
And that is when the fight begins and ends, with him, Trump, and all the other rodents beatrn to a bloody pulp!
I bet he would not do that for his pay that he gets from the Feds so unfair how SSI and medcare is always on the chopping block
Fight Mulvaney y Price with all your might ! They come to destroy Seniors Medicare y Social Security! Fight back 202 224 3121 RT
too bad he won't listen
@LindseyGrahamSC I was actually starting to like you... Not so much now!

@POTUS @VP @GOP @TheDemocrats @BBC @sternde GOP-More MAGA huh?
What is your evil motive Mulvaney to destroy seniors y sick kids health care! You proud of yourself for hurting helpless? RT
why are we messing with health care... we should be regulating insurance company's
Thankkkk you.
Do not confirm Mulveney. Bad for seniors and will cause political suicide for GOP
call Republican senators
@realDonaldTrump Here it goes, attacks on SS, Medicare & Medicaid. Broken promise!
You want to spend trillions on military, infrastructure, tax cuts, & NOT give folks w/preexisting same insurance as others?
and tax cuts primarily for the rich!
FOR SURE! Middle class will not see any.
yeah right!
What a horrible person to pick on the elderly! For shame!
