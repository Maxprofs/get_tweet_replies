Another LIBERAL BUFFOON who is completely out of touch with the world!!
Thx @SenMarkey. #RexTillerson is such an unethical and dangerous choice, there's simple no promises or reassurances that him acceptable
@reevynap He's Putin's right hand man. Do not confirm him.
As your constituent, I urge you to vote against both Jeff Sessions and Rex Tillerson
TY for UR work Sir #RexTillerson must B opposed I respectfully ask U demand investigation of russian interference #DworkinReport
Hillary sold 25% of US uranium to a russian company. Your point?
@SenSchumer Aaaannnnd he'll be in the cabinet anyway because no one seems to care.
Okay. He was effective and successful in doing his job. Wish politicians did their jobs that way. Career politicians r clueless
do you recall this testimony?
Wait. Did you fact check this? You didn't fact check the Buzzfeed crap and referenced it yesterday during hearings.
@SenSchumer please vote NO on Jeff Session and Rex Tillerson.
@SenSchumer Another billionaire in bed with the Russians, walking away with a fistful of loot. Counting on you to say NO!
takes #darkmoney from anti-energy groups #Tillerson #epa #MAGA
Why doesn't @SenMarkey disclose dark money? Winston Churcill: We've established what you are. Now we're just haggling over the price.
So politicians fail, then create sanctions that hurt American businesses and you expect companies to support sanctions? 
Please vote no and do whatever you can to prevent him from being confirmed
you talked for 5:00 and #Tillerson basically told you buzz off I have a J-O-B to do
. Now lets do the math, #ExxonMobil #russia #realdonaldtrump #RexTillerson , something is really wrong here.
@SenSchumer And @HillaryClinton sold uranium to Russia. Please forward your letter of protest to me. Thank you
and what is your point, other than the one on the top of your head?
@SenSchumer disingenuous. Rex is opposed to mandatory sanctions, preferring to use them tactically.
@SenSchumer real we go folks #fakenews from Senator on hearings
I urge you to vote no on the confirmation of #RexTillerson and #JeffSessions
they'll pass. They're extremely qualified
Thank you for representing the interests of the people of Massachusetts and holding this unfit nominee to account
@SenSchumer that's incorrect senator
@Martina oink oink.  Nice work if you can get it.
@SenSchumer You retweeted that? Trying to make your party look bad? You've got to have something better than that.
Wow. It takes a long time for Tilllerson to say NOTHING. Deny Trump a CRIMINAL CRONY CABINET!
and YOU OK'd the delivery of $10 billion + in gold and currency to Iran, the world's leading sponsor of Global terrorism! #hack
@SenSchumer So what's wrong with that is American interest let's be it why you gave my money to Iran I allowed you so????
Did anyone mention Chad? Population still poor because Exxon changed US Gov deal so that dictator could get richer
Hey @SenMarkey Speaking of conflict of interest, who is handling your ice cream truck money since you've become a senator?
@SenSchumer as candidate Trump re Iraq said we should have taken the oil! What conflict would Rex Tillerson have with that??
Because that is not America. That's a football game. To the winner goes the spoils. Kinda like Hitler
@SenSchumer There are sanctions that work and don't. On Russia, don't. They are rocks thrown from behind a self-righteous barrier
@SenSchumer Rex (looks ugly as an old shriveled T-Rex) lied lied lied. Indictment 2 follow? @billmaher @StephenAtHome @sethmeyers
@SenSchumer more sanctions USA not friends with The Russian mob
what did Obama do for 8 years about fentinal drug problems? This is not a new issue
@Dalchico. T-Rex needs to crawl back to his cave.
he just said everyone needs to expand oil... although not in so many words
Thank you - ask the vital questions and stand up to this.
and Hitlery sold them Uranium...
@SenSchumer THANK YOU Senators for asking the tough questions. DONT STOP. Take your vitamins; it's gonna be a long 2 years.
@SenSchumer As a businessman, why wouldn't he oppose - Capitalism at its best. However, could be problem for confirmation.
@SenSchumer YEAH, SO! You people make the laws that businesses have to follow! RIGHT? Has he broken the law?
@SenSchumerits its about patriotism and doing the right thing. Republicans Bidwell behind false God when it $$$$$$$$$$
@SenSchumer add @SenWarren and we have the current 3 stooges. All so silent on the Chineese hacking and billions to Iran.
Tillerson like Russia is not a friend of America...
In business we say, the owner is distinct from the entity itself. Like @realDonaldTrump's a businessman yet he won. 
how much does this aid putin and his nepoleonic world plans . ? !
@SenSchumer Shame it wasnt the size of Texas; investors have done well with Exxon with a 3.5% dividend rate. Thank you Rex
@SenSchumer Cannot be voted through! Too many unanswered questions and vague answers! Admitted he didn't want to answer!
@SenSchumer hey you and all of us benefited from it. You hypocrite
@SenateDems then VOTE NO all of you Filibuster if you have to on #RexTillerson and #Sessions
#EXXONKNEW
And who sold our uranium to Russia again?  Oh yeah, SOS Hillary Clinton!  Where's the outrage there?
Hillary is no longer involved in anything. Why can't you realize that? No more deflection.
Took tweet back.  Not sure what you mean here, actually.
Thank you Senator Markey for grilling nominee Tillerson re conflicts of interest w position of Sect. of State.
Rex is our man! Drill baby drill!
@LOLGOP make Russia great again #mrga
Ifio
@LOLGOP And EXONN's interests are perfectly aligned with a Russian economy that only stays afloat on oil.  #Gazprom
