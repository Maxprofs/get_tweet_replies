and do u really believe the @POTUS will sign ur silly piece of legislation into law? @realDonaldTrump is laughing at you
We won't always agree. Here's a bipartisan bill I also did today w/ GOP Rep Wilson that you may like.
that bill makes sense. Trying to keep a step ahead of digital hacks must be hard work! Thanks for sharing.
There you go again Terrible Ted, stop the grand standing and fear mongering, you're terrible! @seanhannity @POTUS #TerribleTedLieu.
Ted is trying to be a "celebrity." Thinks he's honing his craft.  Yuck. @TuckerCarlson
@PWM62 @SenWarren The use of force act in already in House.
This war was planned by many.
great! Now stop the wall, the pipeline, the registry, the madness of #insanetrump
Still living between fear and disbelief at where we find ourselves. Thx, guys! Keep fighting the good fight for us!
Next up Impeahment?
@jojos444 @SenMarkey @POTUS I'm starting to think this will be needed.
why THANK you! https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/resolved-no-single-person-should-have-authority-order-detonation-thermonuclear-device-over-populated-area …
Wow Ted. How much did the Chinese Government pay you two clowns to sponsor that one?
Please also write a bill requiring a psychological eval and IQ test for presidential candidates to avoid a Hitler type
Thank you Senator. I support you and I support our stability in the world.
Ted Lieu--you are AN American HERO.
Can you just make a rule that people in the govt have to know how to pronounce it? NOT nuke-yular!
Congratulations, sir.  Most heartening news I've seen today.  The world outside America is praying for a win.
Trump wants to nuke Tehran.
Rex Tillerson, oil, edging on Iran.
He is provoking to become a war time President.
Call your congressman - urge them to support this: 844-241-1141
Typical Democrats. They didn't do it for Obama. Stupid!
Fight the power!
That was dumb. It's an executive power of the POTUS. Congress can't take. https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/12/01/no-one-can-stop-president-trump-from-using-nuclear-weapons-thats-by-design/?utm_term=.fe83c65d5066 …
thank you!!! Please keep up the fight!!!
Thanks for keeping us sane.
Good idea in theory. But how are military personnel in charge of launching those weapons to know if POTUS isn't lying?
Typical of the unhinged Dems to try to limit GOP POTUS. Looking for 5 min. of fame to bolster them.
thank you for taking these precautions. Hope it passes! So important.
@ActualFlatticus https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/resolved-no-single-person-should-have-authority-order-detonation-thermonuclear-device-over-populated-area … I beat you to the punch Ted ;-) @ActualFlatticus
I hate that this step is even necessary, but thank you for your leadership!
THANK YOU!  #ImpeachTrump
thank you!@watchyourReps @watchyourSen #heroreps #herosen  for trying to protect the world from crazy

@guinea_wrangler remove the EPA GAG ORDER
this has to pass.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  May God keep you and yours safe and bless you.
good idea! I don't wanna die.
When did you introduce that legislation for any of Obama's wars? Letting O slide was a mistake!
@kattjenny1 @SenMarkey @POTUS My belief from systematic destruction of constitution, Bannon's script of takeover is progressing
@MattM3502 @SenMarkey thank you! He needs to have level heads think before he reacts irrationally which could get us all killed!
yes! Please block him from doing a lot of things, he's a real danger!
@UniteBlue @SenMarkey @POTUS thank you.  A thousand times thank you.
Thank god!
.@SenMarkey  introduced legislation to stop @POTUS from launching nuclear 1st strike w/o Cong. Decla of War https://lieu.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-lieu-senator-markey-introduce-restricting-first-use-0 …

Where is the legislation to keep him from deleting facts from Gov. websites and twitter accounts????
From Scotland, and currently 26 miles from Trident base, thanks!!
.@tedlieu @SenMarkey Thank you Ted!
@CitizenWonk @SenMarkey @POTUS Thank U @RepTedLieu 4 Staying Vigilant Wt @TrumpTheCon
That's nice & all but how about blocking his cabinet of horrors? How about blocking the EC vote?
amen
Please pass this asap. Twitler makes the majority of America very nervous. #Putinspuppet
This is huge.
Thank you. I stand with you.
Thank you. My children thank you. My grandchildren.
Yes. We all know Trump lies. We need to focus on the physical threat he poses. His talks about "taking oil," and nukes.
Thank you!
@thor_sun Thank you God for sane reps like yourselves who watch out for us gainst the criminally insane ones
@maheksico @SenMarkey @POTUS shame on you Ted Lieu and Ed Markey. You know better and you're politicking with our literal safety
@maheksico @SenMarkey @POTUS nuclear launches must be done in matter of seconds/minutes in event of threat. This is so so dumb
/1 US has been on the brink of a nuclear war several times.
@maheksico @SenMarkey @POTUS this is legit a disaster. If @TheDemocrats we're smart, they'd withdraw this ASAP and save face
@maheksico @SenMarkey @POTUS this is perhaps the most RIDICULOUS piece of legislation that completely undermines chain of command
homie i'm just hoping to not get killed in a nuclear war and that's kinda my entire view
this is a terribly horrific piece of legislation and it actively would put us all at risk of JUST that
i feel like trump nuking someone over a tweet would also do that
let's not be drastic now. I hope everyone is aware of how silly that argument is
i feel like it's......not that hard to imagine
I'm very sorry you feel that way
I mean I hope you're right but I view him as dangerously unstable
Thank you.

Our current @POTUS has clearly demonstrated he lacks the gravity to make such a decision unilaterally.
Thank God for this legislation. Trump is a dangerous man lacking self-control. He is unfit for the presidency.
To think that we have a leader so juvenile in his impulses that this discussion even has to take place!
THANK YOU for standing up to this dangerous administration.
you are quickly becoming a national hero!
the voice of reason!  Thanks for attempting to save humanity!!!
Thank you so very much!
Thank you @tedlieu and @SenMarkey! MA voter here who wants to live.
Just another ploy to delegitimize Trump & promote unfounded fear among the weak minded.
please tell us how to support this if we are not your consituents
if you want to support my congressman's bill please forward it to YOUR reps and tell them to support. It will help!
I happen to live around the corner from my Rep's office so I think a trip there this week is in the works.
even better!!
How can I help move this forward? Seriously.
Sounds like pointless posturing.  Typical government waste of time.
You're useless
Today on "Things that shouldn't have to be done, but clearly must be."
You have my support Ted. Thank you for your efforts in protecting us from this mentally unstable #FakePresident

Everybody call your legislators on this one!!!
You should call it the "Counter Puncher Act".
You MUST get this passed. The fate of the world depends on it.
be careful, all that brain power just might make you "smart" people able to blow your nose!
so while you idiots are arguing our country will be in flames? Nice.... SMH!
THANK YOU!!!
idiots
He's violated the law a plurality of times already.  What makes you think this will help?
It gives legal cover to soldiers to not push the button.
Thanks for the clarification.  Provides me with some much needed hope.
Thank you both from the bottom of our terrified hearts! 
Thank you, sir!
Yes.
What can I do to help support this?
I knew I liked you. This + your opposition to warrantless surveillance (and your tweets) make you my favorite.
P.S. Please run for President.
Thank You we are going to need that
Thank you so much for this.
Maybe shoulda been discussed in 1973 when Dems passed War Powers Act over veto of a GOP President?
I would have loved to discuss it then but my parents were three years old. 
I am very glad to know that.  He is a very dangerous person and I do not trust him.
