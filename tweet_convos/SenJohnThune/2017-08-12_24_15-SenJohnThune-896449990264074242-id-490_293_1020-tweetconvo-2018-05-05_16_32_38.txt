So, you almost said "racism" and "white supremacy", but couldn't quite manage to do it. How about "domestic terrorism"?
Agreed. He needs to be specific. Develop a moral compass or get out of the way. Cowardly.
The president needs to denounce white supremacist specifically. Why wont he? Bc some of his base is made up of them.
And the Democrats back BLM and Antifa.
BLM protests for equal rights for black ppl. White supremacist don't want black ppl to exist. There is no correlation
Do you still stand behind this president?


Then denounce Trump! He has enabled this behavior
And Obama backed BLM
Charlottesville is NOT Obama's fault. Trump is president. Act of domestic terror today with at least one dead. From Trump? Nothing.
especially when liberal thugs were bused in again to incite violence

Watching you as well! Vote out is the word. U not supporting our @POTUS & we don’t like it! Is he not a perfect xxx as you? Or hemorrhoids?
So stand up, call out Trump. Our ancestors fought Nazi's, stop being cowards please.
If you mean this, show us. Demand the head of your party, @realDonaldTrump #Resign calling KKK and Nazis good guys not enough? What is?
Milquetoast. How do you feel about torch bearing, pseudo-military, armed crowds chanting "blood and soil" and "Jews will not replace us"
.@Senjohnthune On whose part? This is an utterly meaningless and spineless response. You are part of the problem!
The hate and bigotry occurring in #Charlottesville is disgusting and unnacceptable to the American people. America is better than this.
What about the words our president said! If you can't condemn him and called him out you should not be in our government
DO IT! Call on Trump to resign!

But apparebtly not @POTUS.
Why is President T @POTUS the only one speaking out & telling the truth about violent hate groups BLM & Antifa? Why are you silent?
Then denounce it when it comes from the Oval Office. Tell Trump to resign. Pence too since he "stands with him"
You must disavow the president's statements sir about good people on both sides. Not good enough.
It is NOT about President Trump
He's doing it again in Phoenix. Very Un-Presidential. Very Un-American. He sounded like a racist lunatic.And so disrespectful of AZ Senators
Vote to impeach Trump.
And we deserve better leadership. @realDonaldTrump is incapable and misguided. Please vote against his agenda @SenJohnThune @SenatorRounds
American TERRORISM-killed
USA fought AGAINST Nazi, not "bigots"
Nazis are not our friend as Putin & Erdagon not friends
CEOs answer 2Inv PPL
So WHAT are you going to do with the position we find ourselves in. He will not and cannot change!! Did you sign Censure yet?? #ImpeachTrump
Say the name, coward, say the name
Yes as Pres. Trump said on BOTH sides of the spectrum.  I do not believe in racism but the libs act like nazis themselves. SHAME on both.
When can I expect MY SENATOR to stand on the right side of history, pull away from this inept & dangerous POTUS & call for his resignation?
But side with the @POTUS who is for white supremacist groups
This is NOT a response to KKK and Neo-Nazis.  You are complicit.
Then stand up, show us you have a spine, be American over a republican, demand Trump resign. Now!
Isn't our President supposed to be above and better than this also, leading a charge against it? Why have you failed to call him out? Why?
Silence IS consent...how about including "all" of your state not just east river...
Very tepid response.  No condemnation of @POTUS.  Without that, your credibility is worthless.
Then call out @realDonaldTrump for his pathetic response. He sided with white supremacy. Do something!
Read Brian McLaren's eyewitness account of Charlottesville. You must bear witness as a believer; call out this evil, and this man.
But apparently the @GOP is not and neither is @realDonaldTrump.
Put action behind your words. You must condemn Trump & remove him from office ASAP. #25thAmendmentNow #ImpeachTrump

This is simple: we must condemn and marginalize white supremacist groups, not encourage and embolden them.
https://twitter.com/senorrinhatch/status/897581250952609792 … @SenJohnThune - join other @GOP members and call out #Nazi #kkk #WhiteSupremacists by name

No, not the same. One side is racist, bigoted, Nazi. The other opposes racism and bigotry. Morally different universes.
https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/897575723443027968 … #PickASide #nonazis #southdakota Take a stand @SenJohnThune
The organizers of events which inspired & led to #charlottesvilleterroristattack are 100% to blame for a number of reasons. 1/6
https://twitter.com/SpeakerRyan/status/897579093184610305 … Where you at SD?  Take a stance. #noNazis #Charlottesville
We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity.
https://twitter.com/SenJohnMcCain/status/897624579589451778 … Where you at SD?  Take a stand. #noNazis
There's no moral equivalency between racists & Americans standing up to defy hate& bigotry. The President of the United States should say so

#DoSomething
How do you feel about a president who supports white supremacists and nazis? #ImpeachTrump
Call for trumps impeachment. He is a danger to our country. Help us. We are drowning.
Evidently our president isn't.  Congress needs to do something.
GOP making voting laws that benifit White America only#GOP gov's that came into power changed voting laws to benifit their all white people
If only one republican would lead their party out of this darkness save your party and impeach him
GOP lip service Trump proved it today said one thing Monday and then he blamed the people who did not jump in a car and run people over
Nothing matters unless you do something about Trump. Aiding & abetting evil is a crime. Don't go down on the wrong side of history. #Impeach
Then do something.  trump is inciting violence from neo nazi's.  We look to you.
Our President is not capable of leading this nation.  By standing by this President you are supporting lies, bigotry, hate, intolerance.
@SenateGOP you are culpable for trump
yes America is better then that. Let built America back up impeach the fake president
GOP the party of fascism!
Those are just WORDS sen thune, they mean nothing. Put ur back into it like u did when you tried 2 leave millions w/o health coverage.
Wow, very mealy-mouthed of you. Stand up for what's right and #ImpeachTrump
Did you hear? I believe our @POTUS Trump said it best #maga
What about @realDonaldTrump? If you are all still backing him, you are backing the very things you say you are disgusted by. Help the U.S.!
It is wrong that one individual ran over the people. However, if a group is using the 1st Amendment to gather and march like the GAY PRIDE.
Thankfully, America IS better than this... but the @Potus is not.  What are you doing about his active support for the Neo-Nazis and KKK?
GOP, THE NEW NAZI PARTY
Are you seriously going to do nothing about the maniac in the WH? This lunatic has to be stopped! Wake up GOP. Or have you become Nazi's?
https://twitter.com/PiercedSkull/status/897578330798657537 …
The words that we heard today from the President are unacceptable. He is destroying core values. It is scary. Remove him from office.

POTUS is referring to the torch-carrying crowd on Friday night who chanted “blood and soil” and “Jews will not replace us.”

Nice people? https://twitter.com/Walldo/status/897553995962740736 …
Did you see 45's latest? Your done all of you done
Nazi hate incited violence. DT incited nazi hate. HE JUST DID IT AGAIN!! UNFIT. Ammend 25 now! @SenateReps  @SenateDems @SenMajLdr
You're right.  Get Trump out of office NOW.
HATE AND BIGOTRY IS LIVING IN OUR WHITE HOUSE. THEY ARE DISGUSTING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE WHITE HOUSE SHOULD BE BETTER THAN THIS.
Is it time to denounce Trump yet or are you still waiting for it to get a bit more politically safe?
One tweet against him and the weight is gone. Denounce him. Become the face of the real GOP. Become the leader of the Repubs of old.
STAND UP! #historywilljudge stand up for what is morally right not your party "right" #leadership
Your potus just doubled down on the side of nazis.
The party of Lincoln had installed a nazi sympathizer in the White House. You must fix this. Impeach 45 #FireBannon #Charlottesville
So then impeach POTUS #45 -- stop talking about it -- do something!!
You own him
Trump: “You had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent” 
White House. Is all you do is issue inefficient statements? Not in your backyard huh? Wouldn't want to mess up your tanning.
If true then why does POTUS & The GOP continue 2 help white supremacists & neo-nazis?

The Kelly experiment is officially over how can anyone support Trump amazes me

Have you read the comments in response to the Argus Leader article on Charlottesville? Where's your opinion piece? Better yet, legislation?
What are you doing today to redress the historic wrongs of American white supremacy?
I was willing to give you the benefit of the doubt, until I saw your tweet is almost the same as McConnell's. Let me show how to denounce...
I denounce neonazis, Nazis, skinheads, white supremacists, KKK - in fact anyone who claims superiority over others for any reason.
Their actions and words are deplorable and contemptible. I will stand against them even if i do so alone and even if they are my government
And for South Dakotans, don't think this doesn't exist here. I've seen fools flying Confederate flag in Pierre. This virus is here too.

Wilbur Ross has his own links to Russia and he should explain them http://read.bi/2qTPejK   via @
How can you do sit & do nothing as @POTUS leads America down the path of his idol Hitler
Read your history there are just too many parallels
Get CNN on the tube.  I'll handle Korea later.
Stop, in the name of love.....
So to quote ur words, what the hell r u going to do about the "disgusting & unacceptable hate & bigotry" coming from the 1 u call president?
with all due respect, I would argue that America is not better than this, senator. History shows this.
Do something about Trump.,.,.make him rid the WhiteHouse of Bannon, Miller and Gorka, at the least! Control him! Do your job!

"Daddy, who's that statue of?"

"Son, that's a senator who was privately concerned and deeply trouble…
Yeah will te the idiot president that!!!
Tell your president he doesn't think so
Really?  Where did you denounce the Nazis, KKK, Alt Right Supremacists?  Coward!
Where is your leadership? Why are you not calling them the Nazis they are? Why can't you say they are WHITE SUPREMACISTS!!
I expect to see you and @SenMajLdr at the White House telling 45 to fire the Nazis Gorka, Bannon, Miller, and all their minions!

So what is wrong with your party? Are you guys being bought, blackmailed, threatened?  Because u all are fired not hardly any stand up.
Thiat whole thing was a set up. Put together by George Soros  who brought  in thugs pretending to be Us Mayor owned by Soros.  Why?
Thank you for speaking out. Now if only our President would.
Agree but many are paid to rise up same as in black lives matter. They were RACIST haters.
The RepubParty hijacked by neo-Nazis & their ilk, & enabled by 45. Unless the courageous among you act, the RP headed to dustbin of history.
WTH ? This isn't our country! @marcorubio was targeted by @PutinRF_Eng too #Impeach45 & get it together!
Top Venezuelan leader put a hit on Marco Rubio: report http://hill.cm/nOyBZH5  
Why couldn't GOP see this??
Yes America is better so GOP become a party for all

Shut up puppet!
Which hate and bigotry? From whom? What indeed are you calling out as disgusting?
That's fine but did you condemn BLM and antifa when they committed crimes? Stop being so damn PC!
Someone needs to hold Trump accountable-How much destruction of our country do Americans have to watch? Set aside party-this is abt America
#domesticterrorism by #nazis who were empowered by our president. Call it what it is.
This might the first time I have ever appreciated something you've said.  Thank you for condemning bigotry and violence.
Words aren't enough though, you need to act against racists, including those in your own party
Stand up and be counted on the right side of history. SAY it, white terrorists #ImpeachTrumpNow #FireBannon , #FireMiller ,
Did you call out @POTUS for not denouncing the white-nationalist terrorists? Why not? #TrumpFlunkyThune #RepealAndReplaceThune
#EnoughIsEnough #HeatherHeyer #Charlottesville #ImpeachTrump #CowardlyTrump
Please do the right thing. Replace the president.
@DrDavidDuke carried Trump over the finish line.
POTUS's supporters are white racist they came to peaceful rally organized w/help from the GOP armed w/ weapons to support and kill in hate
Nazi's tortured people based on religion. Nazi's implemented a socialist govt. White guys with tiki torches...not that intense...
The platform and policies of the GOP planted these seeds and Trump is fertilizer that jump starts growth of hatred. When will u stand up?!
You allow the hate to continue by supporting @realDonaldTrump who legitimizes hate.
What do U expect when POTUS has Nazis at his side in WH? This is terrorism. @GOP owns it because U support POTUS.
Say their name...
OK so what are u and your colleagues going to do about the mad man in the W H  that is trying to destroy America do you guys have the balls
It's called domestic terrorism, John. Call it what it really is & show the world what real South Dakota values are. Stand up against hate.
So do something about it, it's time to act. It's not just Charlottesville. By doing nothing U & your colleagues R as much 2 BLAME

#BlackLivesMatter activist says we should "KILL ALL WHITE BABIES". But of course the media won't share this...
