@woodruffbets @Simone_Biles Go back to work and advance a clean Zika bill you loon.
Democrats twice voted against it. Direct your uneducated remark towards them.
Because it didn’t fund Planned Parenthood. You have a nasty mouth for an old lady.
And don't forget the Confederate flag protections! And a nasty mouth keeps me young at heart, ya #TwitterTwat.
Being a nasty old lady isn’t a substitute for wit. Good luck in seeking a bigger vocabulary.
Careful about denigrating old people.  That's your entire Fox audience. Wow.  I DO have a fantastic vocabulary.
I don’t work for them and you can’t write complete sentences. Don’t forget to soak your teeth tonight.
Can you eliminate my taxes too? I also worked hard for what I earned! Why should athletes get special treatment?
...especially when the best of them will make a fortune with commercial endorsement!
..abusive government example
where is tx relief 4 USC abroad? Taxation based citizenship is unethical, immoral and unjust. US ONLY nation to not understand
.@SenJohnThune more like Senator John Zune because we ain't got any need for your ass
I'm a little late to this party but I had to tell you that this is the best thing I have seen in a while.
Vile opportunist.
Dear Lord, just say congrats and then shut the eff up.
I apologize, he has his head up his ass, he's backing Trump. Makes South Dakotans seem dumber than hell.
No need to apologize!! I'm from NY the home of Rudy Giuliani.
@realDonaldTrump thoughts?
Are you fucking kidding us with this?
how about you do your job and pass a budget and vote on Garland...a$$hat
back TRUMP. Hillary will end country with immigration. We can not wait. supreme court needs trump
Stick to keeping your mouth shut and phoning it in like you have done your entire career you azzhat douche!
Senator, apologize to this woman. This bile you just produced is what represents my home state?
can you say #douchebag yes John you are.
How are you going to balance the budget if you are giving money away!
This is the kind of stuff that makes me embarrassed to say I'm from SD. Could Thune be more out of touch?
Do you have a link for the draft text? Would this eliminate taxes for all income earned outside the US?
Your priorities are messed up Win a sporting event? No taxes! Scrub toilets, protect citizens, or teach children? Taxes!
You have earned so much respect from our nation. You are an Olympic hero. Thank you!
Way to denigrate an Olympian's accomplishments with your own personal agenda. What Simone has accomplished is not about you.
tell her how your party has been working hard for the last 25  years to make sure her whole family can't vote
wow! Best. Response. EVER! Hats off to you, sir.
You mean future earnings? Cuz most Americans are ok with paying fair taxes to support impt. programs.
@Simon compensation 4 labor not taxable complete BS,End double standard,DC politician on Obamacare,SS http://mrpresident2016.com 
Somehow, I don't think you've improved @Simone_Biles Olympic experience with this tweet. Go figure.
LOLOLOLOLOL
This guy is Worlds biggest Opportunist. He should be Ashamed. I question after reading   His Judgement
Non of our USA Olympians should have to pay taxes on their medals!!
Force the USOC to pay, since they only spend 10% of donations directly on athletes?
you were quoted in an article by @washingtonpost
- don't use @Simone_Biles for an agenda. How about we talk about voter laws that keep her ancestors from voting? #TwatWaffle
Did you just politicize the #Rio2016 ...disgusting @Simone_Biles
Shh... the adults are talking. Run along and cry about the name of a fuckin mountain.
@woodruffbets Wow, douchiest congratulations ever. Like getting socks for Christmas.
Good one.  Way better than my AYFKM tweet.
It's the Olympics, you sh@thead. She doesn't get any money.
technically they do. The US Olympic Committee pays$25,000 for every gold medal, $15,000 for silver and $10,000 for bronze.
seen it referred to as both cash prize and bonus. All taxable, as well as value of the medal = $564 for gold...
COULD YOU SUCK MORE?!
there are no words for how disgusting you are.
Yes there are. You just never learned them.
how bout - stupid fuckin dipshit redneck with no idea how fuckin offensive that was. Learned those words in 1st grade. More?
who ties your shoelaces for you?
tacky and pretentious.
klassy with a capital K
There is no prize money in Olympic competition. The medal isn't even 24k. #asshat
this is one of the tackiest self promotions any arrogant, narrow minded politician could possibly say. Bad form, sir.
Who told you this was a good idea?
@ddale8 this is the douchiest exploitation of @Simone_Biles yet
your comment is a total combination of ignorance, offensiveness and flat out idiocy. shame on you!
@GroverNorquist Or you can just move to NH where there is no Income Tax..... Or sales tax...
is an asshole
classy post, dingus.
Wow, that tweet started so strongly...and ended with an embarrassing political thud!  BTW, congrats to @Simone_Biles!!
Why are you trolling a 19 year old.....Gross
Do your job!
Gotta say Senator that your offer cheapens the impact of the praise. Bad call Sir. Olympics are not about your election.
@swin24 @Simone_Biles NOPE.
tone deaf. A "masterful" use of The Twitters my friend... smh
quit trying to steal her spotlight, fuckface
Delete your account
#vile
your hypocritical tax cuts would eliminate important funding that would support future athletes like @Simone_Biles
Every single thing isn't about trying to let rich people avoid paying their fair share to support the common good. #greedygop
Your party of trump heads will be sent packing within the next 2 Elections.Go think about that.
Will your bill eliminate me, cause that would really help @realDonaldTrump avoid releasing me. #TrumpTaxReturns
.@SenJohnThune This is possibly the tackiest note of congratulations ever. (Via @MattMurhp24 and @dockrocktex26)
.@Simone_Biles Congrats! My bill would eliminate the taxes you’ll owe on your winnings when you get home. #taxrelief http://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/op-eds?ID=10188581-8E4E-4DFC-84F7-54AA5E1E2988 …
Thanks for confirming why congress has a 9% approval rating, you suck.
Wow, that's a little tacky. You surprise me.
she won't be able to spend it with your anti EPA stance, good thing she can hold her breath. GO @Simone_Biles
A lot of us didn't know there was prize $$What does each medal pay$
what a fucking dingus
typical of Republican congressman to make it all about him, just like his "leader" lol #shameful
Congrats Senator, tax relief 1 Zika relief 0
Let hope all of you GOP RACIST GET THE BOOT out of ofc Thanks Donald
SMH @SenJohnThune U couldn't just congratulate @Simone_Biles but have to attempt to spread a LIE about taxes on Olympic $ prize #URAFool
What a douchebag
Thank God for Obama taking action providing some Zika funding in spite of the obstructionist GOP! #votouttheGOP #Zika @POTUS
#VoteBlue #DemocratTakeover #ImWithHer #MadamePresident #Congrats @Simone_Biles U & the @USAGym team R AMAZING!
He putd a poltical commercial in a great Olympic moment.....really
Really she did this for money I didnt think you won huge amounts for Olympics thought it was for glory stupid me
well that didn't go down like he thought it would
Selfless to the end right Jon?
You win the gold medal for pandering!
This is Donald Trump level stupid. You should apologize to Simone immediately. #Schmuck
Wow. Awful. Embarrassing.
http://i.imgur.com/c0r4Lkk.gif 
Can she just bring her medal to vote or will she have 2 do even more twisting & tumbling to exercise that right?
This is the most tone deaf congrats note ever! Please don't send me any Christmas cards!
Politicizing a young lady's accomplishment of her dream? Go away. Go very far away.
eternally selling used cars in the form of useless senate bills
#WashingtonElite
cc:@Simone_Biles
honey don'tnot paid attention to this clowns Sen go back to work do your job
Thune is this the best you can do for an Olympian. Is everyone in the GOP looney these days.
"Congratulations .@Simone_Biles or Current Resident"
@SenateGOP @Simone_Biles Why are they paying taxes anyway when they're representing our country? Get it together?
focus on something useful, clown, and stop trying to ride @Simone_Biles coattails.
delete your account
"how much in taxes will this win cost" said no athlete or fan of the Olympics ever.
way to make this moment about you!
This is Simone's moment, Congrats Simmone!  Thune sneaking around and overtaking someone else's moment, stop it.
Good to know that GOP Senators never take a moment off from being tools.
Approve Merrick Garland #DoYourJob
don't tweet, and don't be a clown hole
Self-serving opportunist. A heartfelt "congratulations! Well done!" would have been enough... if you weren't an insincere hack
First class trolling!!!!
We want to pay taxes because money is how we get education and health care; the 2 most important things in a society.
Maybe she doesn't care about the taxes she would pay. Maybe supporting her community is more important.
Congrats!  Use DEET! My bill would eliminate public health funds you'll need on any Zika when you return home.
delete your account bitch
jesus, dude. you can't be serious.
you don't get 'winnings' from the Olympics you clown.
Looks like U.S. athletes do get cash awards of up to $25,000 (dep on medal). ... http://tmi.me/1ffjXa 
This mofo right here!  How about a hearing on #MerrickGarland 4 #SCOTUS?  Just one thing positive in 8 yrs pls
Always about the money isn't it? Don't any of your rich buddies ever consider it's time to help America build a new grid?
Wow, you're actually wrapping congratulating @Simone_Biles in tax wank? Of course you are.
Really? Its not your moment. There are MORE IMPORTANT issues you & your colleagues
should be concentrating on
you are an Asshole
Sit down and shut up.
Using this young lady's victory to give yourself a back-pat for laws you haven't passed? Tacky & tasteless.
@realDonaldTrump is shredding Republican orthadoxy and @SenJohnThune is pitching it to a 19 year old who just won Olympic Gold, Simone_Biles
Simone don't listen to this assclown
At least she earned her money, unlike you. Merrick Garland deserves a hearing. @SenateGOP #DoYourJob
as a Brit I'm used to cringeworthy politicians, but you sir, are just vile.

.@SenJohnThune @Simone_Biles 
How low can you go
All the way to the floor
and then down some more
oh hello, SENATOR
she may worry more about your party trying to prevent people of color from voting.
Not sure but US only pays $25000.00 for a gold metal, so taxes are not really a problem. Russians pay big bucks.
What the fuck is wrong with you!?
What are you talking about? Are you going to tax @Simone_Biles' gold medal? Get back to your vacation, Senator!
Hey @SenJohnThune @Simone_Biles I fixed the evaporator fan on my refrigerator so we're all great Americans today!
I bet you're one of those jerks who say athletes (i.e., WNBA players) should keep politics out of sports, aren't you.
Tacky!
Judges
Russia: 3.2
Japan: 1.6
USA: Thune, we're sending you a bill
.@SenJohnThune @Simone_Biles WTH? You got a vacuum you want to sell her too?
Are you starting to rethink your tweet yet?
while at the same time denying her the right to vote.
Ass.
- Your account has been hacked by a major jerk. You should #DeleteYourAccount. Maybe even leave it deleted.
@SenJohnThune
great job to one of you!  The other is an idiot
Congrats Senator! That is the absolute WORST response to this iconic Olympic moment. Delete that tweet + re-examine your life.
Also, trying to politicize and use Olympic athletes makes you beyond pathetic.  Do your job, don't rely on athletes.
Only a political slime ball from The Party of Trump would think this was a clever thing to do. Slimy politicians :(
Politicizing @Simone_Biles's  accomplishment? Shame on you.
What a #douche!How 'bout take #EPA & #PlannedParenthood out of #Zika bill &fix that or #DoYourJob &hold #SCOTUS hearing. @SenJohnThune #gold
huh?? who congratulates someone this way? #classy
OMG, Simone, ignore this loser who is trying to capitalize on your success. Shame on you, J Thune!
Totally tacky. Self serving epic fail
Yeah, dude. It's all about you and your career. #shameless
get a life
you should probably have let her know which families will lose their food stamps so she could save some taxes
not appropriate. Have you even met @Simone_Biles ?
shut up
@SimoneBiles don't listen to this excuse of a man, enjoy this moment, we all love you... @SenJohnThune you're irrelevant and the worst
Simon proving the potential of the next generation. John proving why we should hope his dies as soon as possible
.@SenJohnThune If Simone is the best Simone she can be, you're being the best Sack of Wet Trash Left in the Sun Too Long you can be.
Those 15 people that this will affect are pretty lucky.  Well worth your time John. You play it safe like Hillary.
You should help those young girls that FLDS Warren Jeffs followers like his brother is raping at his compound in your State.
congrats Simone... you're an American treasure. Feck you Sen Thune, you're a self-serving douchenozzle #Rio2016
did you tweet that to all the other American medal winners?? #Jackass
lesson of the day: Congrats is sufficient.
very tacky of you to use an athlete's achievement to promote your tax plan....
You know you're a lowlife when you let FLDS Warren Jeffs followers rape young girls at his compound in your State.
Are you serious? This is your tweet to Simone tonight? Can you say "manipulative opportunist"? Geez.
delete your account
What an achievement! Really sad that you have the time for that but not to do your job and advise on SCOTUS nomination!
Thinking twice about this tweet yet, big guy? See where you went wrong here? Try to be a better American. This doesn't cut it.
#commonwelfare
Another Racist Senator who needs to be voted out!
What the hell is wrong with you?
.@SenJohnThune will you RT my mixtape
Dude.  What a tool.
Have you no sense of decency sir?
Paying taxes is more patriotic than waving a gun around blaming the government for your problems.
As long as we make sure it's revenue neutral by funding the tax break out of your salary!
@missoulagrey @Simone_Biles Brave. How about voting on the SCOTUS nominee or Zika funding? Pathetic.
Oh @SenJohnThune please don't steal her moment to plug a bill.  Congrats @Simone_Biles - ignore politics.
