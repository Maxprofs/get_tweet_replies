@KSoltisAnderson too little, too late #imwithher
That's just common sense that's exactly what should happen
- Reagans 11th--"never speak ill of fellow REpubs-- Wise up!. Dems support a proven criminal& GOP with circle firing squad!
Sorry @SenJohnThune you should have rejected this monster 16 mos ago. The only thing you can do to save America (& your skin) is endorse HRC
Throw your support to #evanMcMullin the only true conservative running.
@marylene58 @SenJohnThune NO, he can't win. All he can do is help elect HRC.
Trump is losing on his own throwing the election away, no policy, all trash,America deserves better
Delusional much?
http://www.myfellowrepublicans.com/  What RU thinking?#WeThePeople have spoken.If U expect 2 keep control of #Senate,U need a #RealityCheck
@jimwaterson  voting's already underway 
Nope, @SenJohnThune. Pence would lose. Trump heads this movement & we're voting him into the WH.
Abso-fucking-lutely
Part of the problem is that everyone in line of secession is just as bad - only they have enabled trump. Pence, Ryan, McConnell. All of them
Pence would be great for President, however Trump should continue, Your allowing the Democrats to Bully Trump.  Do you accept?
Just bypass the Pussy and go straight for the Uterus.
We all know Pence is part of it. Manafort picked Pence for VP. Keep going down the line. You are almost to Hatch.
, do you support reimbursing states for the cost of the primary election in which Trump was elected the nominee?
And what about the money I donated?  I'll sue you and everybody involved!
Africa are friend
buyers remorse?
pathetic weak leaders like you is why we need Trump
Senator are you so out of touch, Hello! America wants Trump.
Your sitting up there enjoying yourself onour dime.and we suffer.
Sure, Senator. Take your party's standard from a predatory misogynist and hand it to a medievalist. Well done.
yeah, replace one sleazy woman-hater with a sleazy Christianist woman-hater... Good Strategy.
Note to @SenJohnThune: It's a foul bird that shits in its own nest. Sabotage. #tcot #pjnet
Why? for speaking the truth? Stand up and act like a Senator!
your a douche bag. So your telling everybody to vote Clinton. YOU ASS.
.@SenJohnThune 3. How will you make that happen, and when? Will people/orgs who funded Trump get a refund? If not, why not?
Who voted for Pence? No one.
why?  Is your name mentioned in those emails?
Great suggestion senator go from an abuser of women's rights to the next. Pence' record on reproductive rights is appalling.
If Trump looses should I switch to Democrat party?
you would still lose, but damn that would be funny.
irac and trump are friends
GOP all backed #pussygrabber 
You're stuck with him! #NoBacksies
I'm sure you have never had a private conversation with a buddy .. Right!!!
I'm a HUGE HOMO!! So, no I haven't...
I never said u were !! But it's ok if you are for each there own
I'm saying I am... so I haven't had a locker room conversation about sexually abusing women.
his comments are rude but guys are rude he was playing the big man women hunter .. Hillary is selling out our country period !!!
however, he had political ambitions even then. You have to be careful what say/do if in public life/politics. All fair game.
u think ? If he really thought about running this would had never happen period. You have to live ur life . He was a tv star
Or the GOP can throw support behind @GovGaryJohnson
please, please, PLEASE throw your support to @GovGaryJohnson.  #Trumpisdone
go home fool.. Stop begging..
Sarcasm. Look it up. #ImWithHer #VotingForJohnsonWillNotMatter

haha!! 
Trump will never do it. He is only about himself.
Rrright,  because politicians are sooo pristine. Hahaha... RT @SenJohnThune:
Donald Trump should withdraw and Mike Pence should be our nominee effective immediately.
Do you really want Clinton to be the next president?  This is how Clinton becomes president.
4. Is it Trump the party is rejecting or his platform? Does the GOP feel "Make America Great Again" is wrong, or just Trump?
So should my Chinese heritage.
you should step down and leave your party. Have some balls and stand behind the candidate
You nominated him, now see it through
Absolutely not.  This thing has backfired on Hillary.
LOL.
good for you Senator! It is time to put country and morals before party
VOMIT BENGAZI MURDERER
...but you'll still vote for him
A man who impose a "religious liberty" law that discriminates against LGBTQ Indianans? No
We needed you six months ago, Sen. Thune. It's too late now. Trump will take the GOP down with him.
<--- He's never been for the Republicans. Sold out America by supporting #ICAAN internet handover to the UN
I think you should withdraw you Sissy !!!!@alexcon272939
Nope, y'all have to own it all the way down.
@RichLowry If ppl wanted Pence at top of ticket they would have voted for him.
yeah, sure, fella.
latino are friends
Your vote is your endorsement of that monster! Shame on you for selling out!
Mike Pence is any better? YOu mean that guy who thinks women should bee jailed for abortion and gays need conversion therapy?
Pence said, Illegal abortion, not legal.
um - pence wants to make all abortions illegal.
Nah, just standing with the child who has no voice.
tell me, how many women do you know that had an abortion? @HawkeyeInDallas @SenJohnThune
Quite a few, why?
so you hang with a bunch of women who have abortions for a living? I see. @HawkeyeInDallas @SenJohnThune
quite a few?  I call bs on that.
I forgive him, I also think like most locker room talk it was exaggerated.  This was low of Hillary, yet you support her.
exaggerated by who?  It's all on audio. There's nothing to exaggerate-- it's all right there.
Donald exaggerated, sheesh most time men exaggerate...sad you don't know that.
he exaggerated grabbing married p***y (while married himself) bc he's a star and he can do what he wants?
Yes
never
.@SenJohnThune @robdelaney Way to stick with your principles, Senator.
China and trump are friends
You don't understand election law much, do you Senator?
nor do you.
Well, I've got a pretty damn good idea. Oh, and RNC Rules Chief agrees
RNC rules counsel Jim Bopp tells RCP "it is impossible" to replace Trump on the ticket at this stage "and it would be politically suicidal"
@rebeccagberg http://lawnewz.com/high-profile/heres-what-happens-if-donald-trump-drops-out-of-presidential-race/ â€¦
Yep seen it previously. Also, this in conjunction with Foley http://electionlawblog.org/?p=87310 
Election law doesn't work that way, Senator. People have already voted.
really???  what is he bringing to the table for women rights??   Zippo
For those Rep's that won't support the peoples candidate, even if TRUMP loses, your days are numbered. Look for another job!
you're a coward.  #DrainTheSwamp
Trump didn't destabilize the ME & create the European Migrant Crisis. He built hotels; Hillary armed terrorists.
Thune wants Trump out so he can raise the gas tax
You could have shown truw grir but you chose a pedophile . He assaulted a 13 year old . A judge ruled on the evidence proceed
Mexican americans and trump are friends
