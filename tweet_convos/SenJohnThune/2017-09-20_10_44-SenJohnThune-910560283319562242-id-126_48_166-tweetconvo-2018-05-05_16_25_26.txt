You're a corporate shill.
@SenateGOP to put States against each other now w healthcare funds is an egregious ploy you don't want to do. Dangerous!!
Yes! They need more money to spend at Truml University.
I think you're lying to us again John; seems we just can't trust you.
70,000 people in SD would lose coverage and the average increase in premiums for SD is $5484. Who are you representing?
And still trying to take our health care, bravo Senator
Senator Thune lining his own pockets, then lying to his own constituents by making up a story about "pocket lining." When will it end?
When he gets voted out someday
74 days. My disabled daughter was thrown out of residential care and has been living in a hospital bed in emergency shelter. Thanks
Get trump and his personal grifters outta D.C.
Tax reform, steal from the poor, give to the corporate donor wealthy. That is far from reform.
Even if we get tax reform - Single Payer Health Ins. will eat it up because of @SenJohnMcCain & @lisamurkowski

but you're giving rich and big business tax breaks. Maybe the @gop should tell the truth for once. Lying is second nature for you guys
@SenateGOP All of you pushing these horrid policies onAmerica will pay the polls. WE are sick & tired of the lies & BS. Trying
Your idea of tax reform is tax cuts for the 1%. The only way to pay for it is to eliminate healthcare for MILLIONS of Americans. Despicable!
For working families, it's not that taxes are too high but wages & opportunity are too low. @GOP #TaxReform only grows the wealth dividepic.twitter.com/zgB8IqIYPQ
dad makes $90k a Mom makes $90k YET a gov Funded Paycheck pays 1/2 of #SS medicare Tax than a #Gov #Employee that makes $180K, its #THEFT
Did that actually make sense to you?
COME ON , KIDS GET 200+ PIECES OF CANDY AT HALLOWEEN, YET IF KIDS HAD A MONTHLY ALLOWANCE THEY WOULD NOT BUY ALL CANDY. DUH
Better rewrite the bill the boys from Goldman-Sachs sent you. Nothing in there but a windfall for the wealthy and for large corporations.
This will not happen. A resulting recession would hurt the middle class.
All of these lies will be revealed when/if you traitors to the American People get your way. "Health Care", tax "reform", all lies
Effective tax rate on fortune 500 companies is 12.6%, the lowest of any developed nation. https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetnovack/2013/07/01/gao-big-companies-paid-a-12-6-federal-income-tax-rate/&refURL=https://www.google.com/&referrer=https://www.google.com/ â€¦pic.twitter.com/JDVa9Y0UtC
Look at that SOB sit there and pretend to give a rat's ass about middle class families. And of course they lap it up, blame the poor for all

Define middle income families. I'm sure the people who fall outside that range would be disappointed that you don't think 40% is enough
Is this tax reform a lie to the people to and benefits donors
FAIR TAX at 15% rate would accomplish more than your plan.Frees us from filings, penalties, liens, levies, seizures, & has 1 pg Biz filings.
but the rich will get orders of magnitude more and get even richer at the expense of the average American, and you expect us to believe you?
We need to raise taxes on the wealthy and stop corporate welfare.
Pls do this get it going and vote for GC bill we need help in middle income bracket. Taxed out tapped out
I'm all for tax cuts for the middle class but most of the cuts you are pushing will only affect the wealthiest people in the country.
We see it. Tax cuts for your wealthy owners is the goal @ expense of the people. And that includes health care plan GOP wants to destroy.
Lying conman phony crooks just want tax cuts for billionaires. NO to TrumpCare! @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @SenJohnMcCain @SenateGOP
Yup, the money they save will definitely offset the losses in cuts to public services.
Tax Reform will never happen as long as @GOP #NeverTrump RINOs like Judas aka @SenJohnMcCain are in office
Why cant we vote people into congress and admin who will actually work for the people and not for their own pockets?
the key words here are "Middle Income". Nobody believes you.
Unfortunately a lie.pic.twitter.com/PfF2RHqEYb
Really? Bilbo Sellout Bernie Sanders thinks we should just sign our checks over to him so he can decide how we live
Koch Brithers threatening to with hold their $? Coming by $ honestly is so lame, right?
@SenateGOP It's great you feel middle class deserve more. Raise min. wage and support unions is the way. @housegop
Just waiting for the day when we have a say in how and where we want our money spent, instead of law makers.
why no @USCBOcostest and no debate on #CassidyGraham if it is truly such a great plan. Oh, you say it's NOT a great plan?
And by middle class you mean billionaires.
Hard to believe anything said by anyone in GOP period!
I am praying for the success of the presidents agenda.
For working families, it's not that taxes are too high but wages & opportunity are too low. @GOP #TaxReform only grows the wealth divide
The markets only favor the rich. @GOP tax cuts for rich and trickle down economy do nothing to help low and middle income families
I'm still studying this tactic of yours. Amazingly successful! Like Lucy with the football, works every time. I'm quite proud of you!
Quit with the bull shit. We know who the GOP is. You need to go the way of the whigs.
The top 1% of Americans have 40% of wealth. Lowering their taxes will not create more good jobs, tho it will employ illegals who are the...pic.twitter.com/s1fpNzQ8TQ
...only ones who will work hard for low pay! There is no middle class anymore. Trickle-down/supply side won't fix that.
How in the hell would cabinet peeps be able to afford those peivate chartered jets. O wait they are just so busy. Ya right
The 1% will get the Estate Tax & Dividend Income waived along with some other goodies and the rest of us will lose our mortgage deduction!!
