A "one-sentence" Band-Aid can't fix flawed Obamacare, riddled with #BrokenPromises from skyrocketing costs to failing state exchanges.
.@Senate_GOPs are working hard to help those hurt by Obamacare, which is a fundamentally flawed system. #BrokenPromises
@SenJohnThune @Senate_GOPs Talking about Obamacare being bad is useless if you don't provide an alternative. USELESS.
@Siniful @SenJohnThune @Senate_GOPs the GOP has several replacement plans, they can't agree on which one to present. Very poor politics
@KelticSC @Siniful @SenJohnThune @Senate_GOPs keep doctors and hospitals private, replace insurance companies with government
@nathanmckenie01 @Siniful @SenJohnThune @Senate_GOPs who's plan is that? And y would govt being the ins company ever be a good idea?
@KelticSC @Siniful @SenJohnThune @Senate_GOPs you trust gov with your food, (FDA) and your safety, (fire, police,) so why not basic care?
@nathanmckenie01 competition. The govt screws up many things and they do it a lot. I don't think I want them screwing up my health ins
@SenJohnThune This tweet literally makes no sense.
@SenJohnThune No Senator UR the one the refuses to accept that the ACA is good for this country.Think of the people instead of UR party
@SenJohnThune Actually, it's the do-nothing Republican Congress, not Obamacare, that's bad for the American people. @POTUS
@SenJohnThune so you  mean the subsidies the GOP is suing to get rid of in order to bring down the ACA.You're either a liar or really stupid
IS THIS A PARODY ACCOUNT? @SenJohnThune @POTUS Obamacare is providing those subsidies... GOP is source the subsidy risk.
@SenJohnThune @swin24 @POTUS Where is your plan Senator? You control both houses of Congress and have produced no alternative plan-why?
@SenJohnThune wow...are you that dumb or do you just play one for effect??
@SenJohnThune @POTUS Senator Thune..lie much?? You should be ashamed
@SenJohnThune You and your dishonest brethren stand for everything that is wrong with our government. In it for nobody but yourselves.
@SenJohnThune @POTUS if ever you needed proof that politicians think their constituents are idiots…
@SenJohnThune @POTUS Don't touch my Obamacare.
@SenJohnThune @POTUS This is like the greatest logic ever. Evil program is bad for America, and even worse when you take it away. lol.
@SenJohnThune this tweet is from The Onion, right? Right?
@SenJohnThune @POTUS That's an awfully nice subsidy you have there, be a shame if something happened to it.
@SenJohnThune @POTUS The flawed logic of this statement is embarrassing for SD.
I do have to admit John, you'd make a dandy #Troll @SenJohnThune @POTUS
@SenJohnThune @POTUS Upset 6 mill people who only have because of ACA are going to lose it because you GOP fucks won't make a two word fix?
@SenJohnThune Did you draw the short stick Senator, or are you really this thick?
@SenJohnThune @POTUS - No sir, Senator Thune.  YOU r bad 4 the American ppl.  Re-read what u just tweeted.  How is it bad 4 6 mil ppl?
Uh, @SenJohnThune you do know that Obamacare GOT THEM those Health Care Subsidies, right?  @POTUS
@SenJohnThune @POTUS Perhaps the stupidest statement about ACA ever made.
Your statement is bullshit. One sentence fix and problem disappears @SenJohnThune @POTUS
@SenJohnThune only a special kind of stupid would tweet an incoherent statement.
@SenJohnThune @POTUS a United States Senator everyone...
@SenJohnThune are you really a dufus or just play one on TV? #ACA #AffordableCareAct
@SenJohnThune @POTUS Wait....are you working for The Onion now?
@SenJohnThune This makes absolutely no sense. It’s your fault if they lose subsidies, and they know it.
Six million people risk losing their health care subsidies, yet @POTUS continues to deny that Obamacare is bad for the American people.
@lcchoppers @wordbirdsnest @SenJohnThune  ESL?
.@SenJohnThune Someone posted a screenshot of your tweet on FB; had to see for myself if anything so stupid could be real.
@SenJohnThune Go ahead and argue what you did was right, but for you to not have the fu*king ball sack to take responsibility is absurd.
@SenJohnThune @POTUS Just shut up. You all are crazy and confused.
@SenJohnThune @POTUS Since the 6 million get to KEEP their subsidies, I assume you now realize that Obamacare is GOOD for us?
@SenJohnThune But then again - you don't have to worry about health care do you? YOU get the best. We get what? CLINICS? @POTUS
@SenJohnThune say what?
@SenJohnThune You sir, are dumber than a rock
@SenJohnThune @POTUS It makes me angry when politicians have the nerve to lie so brazenly to avoid responsibility for their actions.
.@SenJohnThune Please explain how having affordable health insurance thus being able to get healthcare is bad for the American people. Thks!
@SenJohnThune @POTUS OMG. This unexplored level of dolt-speak is brought you to by the letters G, O, and P.
@HadrianM @gaildaye @SenJohnThune @POTUS Because it's not bad for the American people, Sen. Thune! Are you brain dead? See the statistics!
@SenJohnThune Are you really as stupid as this tweet, or do you just offshore your social media to some Roger Ailes sweatshop? #factsmatter
@SenJohnThune These people are at risk because of a bullsh*t lawsuit YOUR buddies launched. Are you really that fu*king stupid?
@SenJohnThune @POTUS It is sad to see I pay you over $175,000 a year to be this fucking stupid.  Good lord.
@RiskyLiberal @happyloner @SenJohnThune @POTUS Does "Thune" mean "lobotomy" in some other language? This is one of the dumbest tweets ever.
@SequesterTales @RiskyLiberal @happyloner @SenJohnThune @POTUS They’ll get weirder as the GOP candidates try to one up on his stupid tweet
@SenJohnThune Instead of fighting the ACA why don't you try and make it better.
@SenJohnThune @POTUS millions have access to healthcare that didn't before and they only risk losing it because of morons like you
@BondageByMCH I was already a fan of your work, but it's even nicer to scroll through your feed & see a lot of sensible progressive thoughts
@BondageByMCH It's always truly amazing to me when I see a hardcore GOP loyalist on Fetlife. Completely voting against our own interests.
@HybridNeo85 I agree!  Nice to meet a fellow kinky liberal!
Hoping someone hacked @SenJohnThune's acct. Otherwise, THIS MAN IS A SITTING U.S. SENATOR! AAAACK!!
Six million people risk losing their health care subsidies, yet @POTUS continues to deny that Obamacare is bad for the American people.
@SenJohnThune @POTUS O!G OMG OMG!! YOU people are bringing this frivolous lawsuit that would make this happen! OMG!
#GOPLawsuit @Maggyw519 @SenJohnThune @POTUS 
It's actually a #GOP tax increase on poor people only.
#ACASubsidy
@AntarianRani @Maggyw519 @SenJohnThune @POTUS exactly. Ppl will still HAVE to buy insurance (unless they change that) but w/no subsidies.
@trcfwtt @AntarianRani @SenJohnThune @POTUS all in RED states who refused to set up exchanges! THEIR FAULT!
@Maggyw519 @AntarianRani @SenJohnThune @POTUS But this was ppl in red states only hope of getting ins at all since they rejected medicaid.
@trcfwtt @AntarianRani @SenJohnThune @POTUS exactly
@Maggyw519 @AntarianRani @SenJohnThune @POTUS repubs r pure evil!
@trcfwtt @Maggyw519 @SenJohnThune @POTUS 
I wonder how they gonna explain to the people they keep poor that Obama took away their #ObamaCare
.@SenJohnThune Excellent job of obscuring the fact that the GOP has no pkan to get these people coverage. @POTUS
@sistermoon50 @SenJohnThune there's actually several replacement plans. They can't agree on 1 to present
@KelticSC @sistermoon50 @SenJohnThune That's as good as no replacement plan. You do or do not, there is no try.
@dale_in_denver @sistermoon50 @SenJohnThune to figure it out
@KelticSC @sistermoon50 @SenJohnThune Obama's elected 2008 - they've had nearly 7 years "to figure it out" They've got no viable alternative
@dale_in_denver @KelticSC @sistermoon50 @SenJohnThune Tim, like most conservatives, doesn't believe in personal responsibility so whatev.
@JimmyA_Shook1s @KelticSC @sistermoon50 @SenJohnThune Of course he does: personal responsibility for "others," not for like minded folks.lol
@dale_in_denver @JimmyA_Shook1s @sistermoon50 @SenJohnThune I really am. U guys win Twitter. Morons
@SenJohnThune Just missing #iamarepublican HT.  Are you really this stupid? Subsidies for 6m are at risk bc of YOU, Senator, not @POTUS.
@SenJohnThune @POTUS the 6 million losing the healthcare isnt because of aca, it's because the morons constantly trying to repeal it
@SenJohnThune @POTUS How can you even represent people with a stupid as comment like that.
@modrtmike @Observer142 @SenJohnThune @POTUS John is the smartest guy in SD
@boris3324 @modrtmike @SenJohnThune @POTUS Bad news for SD.
@Observer142 @modrtmike @SenJohnThune @POTUS And America
@SenJohnThune But a one-sentence fix would prevent the aforementioned 6 million from losing subsidies, no?
@daveweigel @Rcarpentieri1 @SenJohnThune but what if I don't want it?
@TGMowerman @daveweigel Same as I have to buy auto ins. Personal responsibility, no mooching off insured for uninsured run up large bill.
@Rcarpentieri1 @TGMowerman @daveweigel U talking about personal responsibility is the funniest thing Ive heard in a month.Thx for the laughs
@SFLHOV @TGMowerman @daveweigel How so? Are you assuming I'm not personally responsible & self reliant? Do you know me or my life, sir!
@Rcarpentieri1 @SFLHOV @daveweigel I know you are responsible. The question remains, why am forced to buy something I don't want?
@TGMowerman @SFLHOV @daveweigel 

So everyone else doesn't have to pay when you're sick w/no ins, go to hospital. You know, pay your own way
@Rcarpentieri1 @TGMowerman @daveweigel The point of Obamacare is that WE are paying for people who don't pay their own way
@SenJohnThune @POTUS What is your proposal to keep medical care affordable for all?
@SecurityStrateg @SenJohnThune @POTUS Bootstraps!
@SenJohnThune shut up you lying scumbag good for nothing senator, you should be ashamed
@SenJohnThune how did you even get elected? Oh that's right, you're a rich white dude who bought his way into power.
@SenJohnThune @POTUS This is the dumbest tweet I've ever read-Americans love ACA
@SenJohnThune @POTUS Wut. This tweet is in the dictionary under "FAIL". http://sadtrombone.com/ 
.@SenJohnThune @POTUS And we have a new candidate for the stupidest POS in Congress. Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you @SenJohnThune.
@SenJohnThune impressive doublethink, truly impressive
@SenJohnThune @POTUS  That self-awareness train rolls by and some people refuse to get on. What has GOP done for the uninsured? Z-E-R-O.
@SenJohnThune @POTUS Bless your heart. This makes absolutely no sense at all.
@SenJohnThune @POTUS Try not having insurance. Oh wait, you do. Now I see why you don't give a shit. #PMF
@SenJohnThune @POTUS - what you said here doesn't make sense.
@SenJohnThune If *losing* 6MM subsidies — which are part of #Obamacare! — is bad, #Obamacare is *good.* #QED #ThanksForPlaying @POTUS
@SenJohnThune Are you an idiot?  Your party is the one trying to take away our subsidies in the first place. But you already knew that.
@SenJohnThune Sorry, your  CYA tweet isn't going to help you if subsidies get gutted. We love #Obamacare. Kill it at your peril. @POTUS
@SenJohnThune @POTUS What you just said was so idiotically ridiculous that to call it a lie would be a compliment.
@SenJohnThune @POTUS Muddled reasoning. Makes no sense whatsoever!
@SenJohnThune @POTUS if they lose it, it's because of the Republican's lawsuit! Blaming him for your parties actions??!
@SenJohnThune Thune--rhymes with buffoon. Those 6 million have the subsidies BECAUSE of OBAMA and DESPITE you heartless Republicans.
@SenJohnThune and how many more people would be without healthcare if it weren't for the Affordable Healthcare Act? Disingenuous.
@SenJohnThune @POTUS that is truly the stupidest thing I have ever heard well done #tcot #UniteBIue #LibCrib
@SenJohnThune @POTUS You are a tool, aren't you.
@SenJohnThune once again u think voters are stupid that they'd instantly buy this bullshit
@SenJohnThune @POTUS your comments on ACA are erroneous, dishonest, or, as in this example, simply nonsense.  Keep up the good work!
@SenJohnThune @POTUS yea.... Don't think so!
@SenJohnThune is not the sharpest knife in the drawer huh?  Try doing something good for it will make you feel better #gopfail
.@SenJohnThune: This is like that McKinney police officer warning there could be violence at pool parties.
. @SenJohnThune Good one. You throw poison in the pie and then claim apples are bad for people.
@thereisnohurry and then feign sympathy for pie eaters @SenJohnThune
@marabout40 @thereisnohurry @SenJohnThune You win part of the internet today, Amarlie.
