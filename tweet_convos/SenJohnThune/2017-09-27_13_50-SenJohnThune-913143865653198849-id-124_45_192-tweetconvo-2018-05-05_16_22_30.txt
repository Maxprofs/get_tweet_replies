"Death Tax" only affects estates over $5mil solo or $11mil couple. This is for 1%. When will you stop the lies?!
Never, because the GOP base believes all their lies.
You call yourself a conservative? How are we going to pay for this giveaway to the rich?
Bullshit
No. It doesn't. #fakenews
BS. This will just make income equality worse! Tax cuts for billionaires and wealthy corporations! We are tired of you telling us lies.
Why is adopting resident based tax'n for individuals NEVER in dialogue even tho part of @GOP 2016 campaign pledge? #TaxReform #shameonyou
Shill

@SoDakDems @indivisible605
What is a Middle Income? I figure $24 to $80K , Rich is 100K to $300K per year. Wealthy is not Working at all & $1 million in the bank
WE MUST HAVE LEARNED DIFFERENT.... MIDDLE CLASS WILL NOT BENEFIT, ONLY HIGH WEALTH,BUT THEN LOOK WHO WANTS IT PASSED! LOOK WHO WROTE IT!#
How much more? How much more will $50,000/yr coal miner keep? How much more will $ 1,000,000/yr Ins. Co. Executive keep? Need DETAILS please
Admin promised to make coal mining great again...will the coal miner get same % tax break as coal mine owner gets? DETAILS please.
No sir and further this will remove itemized deductions the legs the middle America's business stands on not to be taxed to death.
How does cutting corporate taxes help the average citizen that is not a business
And just like Illinois, will NEVER recover. Why not just load us on #TrumpGasChamberTrain
#Save_America 
#Fire_Trump
Liar, liar, pants on fire! 
GOP #TaxReform is BS... your 35%, plus other tax and insurance will leave less in the paycheck, not more. Only benefits the top 1%...
What part of bullshit don't you understand~every time the republicans tax cuts to their cronies the debt for the American people goes up
I think that you're wrong! Taking away the itemized deductions of State & Property taxes and mortgage interest taxes the middle class more.
You are talking to a Senator from a state with no income tax.  All similar states pay a higher tax rate, than states like yourself.
Like the health care disaster you supported? It's apparent your interest lies with strictly with your party, not South Dakotans.
Is middle income the new term for the 1%? I always thought middle income meant average. So I guess now we just call ourselves dirt poor.
You don't seem to understand that the middle class is endangered or extinct in some areas there for 1% becomes the middle
Exactly!
How about middle income small business owners?  Would the tax reform help us business wise?
No sir it has sweeping changes to the itemized deductions as in they practically won't exist. But it would help a large company invest.
Bullshit. It gives tax breaks to corporations and the wealthy.  Same crap the @gop have been pulling since Reagan. Trickle down is a scam.
Confusion here is, business taxes are paid by customers of that company, simple they are us, so lower their taxes,  helps us all
Another lie about tax reform.  Corporations and the Top 1% gets all the breaks.  Nothing to see here for the middle class.  Stop lying.
That's a lie
AND...you will single handedly collapse the housing mrkt...no mortgage int or prop tax credits means walking away from home ownership...
...aren't enough. So adopt a platform that works for everyone not just the #DonorClass the electorate is watching and #ReElection comes fast
And because I know you don't qualify for the #StandardDeduction your idea of doubling it means #DiddlySquat because my wages tax free.....
The small business #TaxReform won't effect MOST of because minorities, veterans and PoC don't have the preferred credentials so #NiceTry
The increase in the child tax credit won't encourage to have kids if we can't afford to house/feed them so maybe making #HR1880 a thing?
Ok so what I earn is not enough to cover the basic costs of living so even my wages TAX FREE aren't enough + medical costs I'm #FightFor15
Your tax reform bill is another @GOP gift to wealthiest Americans. #Liars
Actually,  this bill gives tax cuts to all paying taxes, someone paying 1,000 and someone paying 1,000,000. One check will be larger.
profundizar
.@SenMajLdr @SpeakerRyan A Big, But Fixable? What about #DeficitIncrease 4 #CorporateTaxCuts & #DeathTaxRepeal?
Give middle class the first $100K tax free, insist when this #TaxReform fails corp's payback credit. Reagan lamented trickle down is a SCAM!
@CNN dad makes $90k Mom makes $90k YET John & gov Funded Paycheck pay 1/2 of #SS medicare Tax than 2 #taxpayers that make $180K,Fair? #THEFT
whens the last time you stood at start of day #pledge, senators that are not present for pledge should not vote that day, #ShowUpForPledge
Anyone who believes anything a Republican says is deaf & blind!
Doubtful middle income people will benefit. Will tax cuts to business really create more jobs? They're already sitting on a ton of cash
Somebody tell me what a middle income American is?
Hey @SenJohnThune, you know what would REALLY help middle class Americans? Private insurance abolition and universal Medicaid buy-in.
Get him out before he kills us all!!
What would u think about a high pay national lottery @ $5/ticket w/all proceeds to go toward principal only debt reduction.
The Senate can't make what the House passes any better! Grow a pair, shut down Chuckie & McCain, & pass something to help the people of SD!!
Better get it done, Senator!! You have waaay more influence than just 1 vote!!  Use it, and get the House's tax bill passed & sent to POTUS!
Actually, what he needs to do is not do that.  I really think you missed the word "not" in your tweet here sir.
Trump's tax plan - those with kids would see the biggest tax hikes. Exemptions will B eliminated- that's a loss of $4,050 per kid. 
Not true
Are you illiterate?   Or are you lying to your constituents?   One or the other because that proposal hurts all but the wealthy
I'm wondering what you consider middle-income? Can you clarify please?
I will wait to see the details although I must say I am not too optimistic.
You haven't stopped lying since the day you joined the Senate. What the hell happened to you???
Maybe you could figure a way out to create intensives so they can earn more. Get middle America better paying jobs.
Bullshit.
Giant tax break for the rich. Tax increase for the poor. Turning USA into Kansas. Pretty shameful, Senator.
Need to see Trump's taxes was before voting.
Hillary lover!
If the middle class is not those with household income of 50.000 and up it's garbage tax reform!
Oh please...what's your #kickback?  Corporations offer NO #trickle_down. We have LONG memories. #VoteNo  We #vote.  We say NO or GO!
You are a damm liar.  you gave us tRUMP the Russian confederate whose campaign was KGB funded.
Let's make it 10% across the board, with an exemption for people in poverty. That seems fair.
LIAR ...
What was announced as tax reform isnt even close to tax reform.  Reducing tax rates is not reform, refirm is tossing the majority tax code
Liar! Have an open town hall and lie to our faces, coward.
Shame on you talking about taxes Americans are dying #helpPuerto Rico
Misleading, on foreign profit. Foreign states give US mfg low tax & even subsidy, +we charge 15% on top. At 35% =Made in USA
Nope, in general tax reform usually means that the government is just trying to make the top 2% more money.
What an embarrassment. To have someone tweet this. DISGUSTING
Senator,Please challenge @SenateMajLdr for Leadership position.We need legislation to pass-your respect +clarity can make this pass. MAGA
How are u going to pay for it?
You Republicans lie to us so much if you told me the sky was blue I'd look outside to verify it. @GOP don't believe you. Also #HateYouGOP
#2facedGOP #AintShit
Sounds good senator... but ????You bozo 's failed on healthcare...can we really feel confident you actually do Something. Your last chance..
Pimping this is not going to take away your failure repealing Obamacare like you promised. Obamacare is the biggest tax hike in US history.
"Keeping more of what you earn" is Republican-speak for not providing the programs your money can't afford anyway.
If you believe this crap. @SenateGOP just tried to Steal Ur HealthC & Pre-Exist. Same old @GOP Ponzi Scheme new name that's shrinks MCLASS.
Lies!! I will pay much more!! No child credit no 401k deduction. This will destroy middle class families!
Lies   its for the rich   its regam trickle down all over again
You know what a REAL break would be?
Removing #Dysfunctional @realDonaldTrump from power. #TaxReform can wait.
#SaveAmerica #ImpeachTrumpNOW
.@GOP #TaxReform another scam to take from poor & middle class & give to your rich elite masters, .@SenJohnThune.
We'll see what the plan entails after it's fully dissected . If it cuts Nedicare, Medicaid and Social Security then it's not going to pass.
Tax breaks for billionaires, most profitable companies is not tax reform. #RepealAndReplaceThune #TraitorFlunky #NoFriendOfThePeopleThune
You are a shameful liar!  You give big tax breaks to the rich and screw everyone else!
It's very hard to convince people who don't trust you anymore not after healthcare. it's hard.
it's so naive the way Republicans sell tax reform they pass the script from one to another and they come out one by one.
Your nose is growing.
Donâ€™t forget this part: Once it exceeds the $5.49 Million exemptions for singles and $10.98 Million for couples.
Is this plan more credible than Graham-Cassidy?
Give me the five key points we're it helps us
I call bullshit! What's your definition of middle class? 250k +? That's not us.
So they can move more of what they earn into Obamacare premiums? Reshuffling
Tax cuts mean trillion dollar revenue loss for the US.  What gets cutvto make up for that loss? Education? Healthcare? FEMA? The WALL?
Why are no Republicans even lying and asserting that their tax plan will cut the deficit? Deficits only matter when a Dem is in the WH

Any justifications for dismissing the $1.5 trillion cost of the GOP tax reform plan defy both evidence and logic: http://bit.ly/2fv1fJm  

$269,000,000,000.

That's how much the GOP #TaxReform plan would give billionaires like @BetsyDeVos & @RealDonaldTrump by ending estate tax.
You say frame work that man a starting place I'm go to wait for final bill if you don't mind
The smirk gives away your bullshit.
You know you are lying. Any child can see that.
Sir, stand up for patriots of all parties and denounce this president like your colleague Sen. Corker.
This is GOP BS
Liar. Your bill raises taxes on the middle class!
