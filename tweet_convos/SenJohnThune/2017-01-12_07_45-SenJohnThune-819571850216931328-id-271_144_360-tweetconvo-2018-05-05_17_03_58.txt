here's an idea. How about we all get the same healthcare plan you get in Congress? Seems only fair, since we pay your salaries.
Still waiting for an answer...
Let's not conveniently use the average examples of G.B. and Canada; EU repleat with wonderful health care program successes
@SenateMajLdr no. Trump lost the popular vote. There is no trump mandate
@SenateMajLdr please consider putting everyone on Medicare Part A and control the hospital system. The Ins. Comp. insure the rest
U are so vendictive and all u can see 2 repeal everything MY president did while in office. Shame on u. Black souls,all of u ! @SpeakerRyan
A sad day in American history.
Do it!
Americans support the ACA. They want healthcare. You hid it behind Obama's name to scare them. #SymptomsOfDisease
messing w/pre-existing conditions etc is not what ppl voted for. clock is ticking; '18 is sooner than you think & you'll be out
GOP may be hoping non covered voters will be Dems with a short life expectancy
prob but they're going to bite the hand that feeds them in white blue collar worker
they had 6-7 years to find a replacement and still nothing. We're all screwed because the ACA touches all ins
Maybe they just couldn't come up with something better
Americans did NOT give you a mandate. There are 3 million reasons you are wrong. Quit grandstanding and MODIFY- use your brains.
@SenateMajLdr NOTHING short of #FullRepeal #Obamacare = #MedicalDebt
No subsidues from taxpayers in any form!! Return what we had
@SenateMajLdr tRUMP/pence are illegitimate. elected by Putin.  Lost by almost 3 million votes. Represent ALL Americans, not GOP
did you miss that Trump did NOT win the popular vote?  We want health care, we want an HONEST, government. TOGETHER
You DON'T have a workable plan.  If you are going to repeal and replace with SINGLE PAYER, then it's about time.
WE DO NOT WANT REPEAL WE WANT ACA FIXED.  Stop wasting time and money for party politics.
Americans voted for HIllary Clinton. Americans support the ACA, want and need healthcare.Why does GOP hate America?
#SymptomsOfDisease
@SenateDems "fixing" doesnt mean changing.  fix means making it better for those using it, not those that dont!!!
What's ur suggestion for the newly uninsured & the rocketing costs the rest of us will pay.? What's YOUR plan cost?

@SenateMajLdr replace with what? Asshat
You have no mandate. 2.9m more people did not want GOP & gerrymandering your way to a maj. is not a mandate. LIAR!
if you have a mandate,its to "repeal & replace with something better", not repeal, not just replace, replace #WITHSOMETHINGBETTER
you have premium health care and you want to take ours away! When we're dead, who's taxes will support you and your lifestyle?
I didn't vote for repeal of ACA!!
when voting against status quo= middle class wants to struggle less not more.
63%of Americans approve of ACA. The insurance lobby will be the recipient of eliminating ACA not the people
HOW COULD YOU vote for these measures to repeal + take away key provisions of ACA without having a plan in place?
no we didn't. Trump lost by 3 million votes.
I have heard a lot about Repeal but. I thing on the replacement. What is it?
enact a law that all House and Senate members MUST use what ever health care that you are making Americans use.
Actually it was Electoral College, NOT the majority who you need to listen to now. Represent ALL the people, please
- YOU have NOTHING BETTER! Leave  ACA in place! STOP HURTING AMERICANS! The only people you care about are yourselves! NO votes
more lies from the lying Republicans.
do not repeal affordable care act. We need our insurance
Americans voted for the ACA.   The EC voted otherwise.   Don't confuse a EC Vote for a mandate.   You don't have one.
I don't know whose call you heard but now there are 30 million people without insurance. We won't be calling you in 2018.
@SenateMajLdr You misunderstood. We meant replace you and the rest of the incompetent Congress.
you did it. You bamboozled ppl into believing it was different than the #ACA. Well played! Enjoy your money.
there were other presidents who tried this, they saw the light. Why is it these idiots today could not?
Americans did not vote to change the status quo. The majority voted for Clinton so don't think you have some wild mandate.
http://www.rawstory.com/2017/01/this-is-a-death-sentence-for-me-patients-react-in-horror-to-gops-late-night-obamacare-repeal/ … Please do not repeal until you are ready to replace!
@SenateMajLdr There is no replacement plan is there.
@SenateMajLdr Trump-care is NO care.
@SenateMajLdr Where is the damn replacement plan Mitch?
@SenJohnThune I'm not ready to repeal the #ACA and take healthcare from 19½ million people.
@SenJohnThune Only ¼ of Americans want #Obamacare to be repeal. So, your #POTUS has a 35% approval rating expect that to fall.#US
Coal miners and families hope for Trump jobs - but lose Black Lung benefits in Obamacare! Ooops. @MineWorkers @TheDemocrats @CNN
Let's start counting how many people Trump & Republicns will kill as they lose insurance! Sorry coal miner families! @MineWorkers
@SenateMajLdr How much time have you spent polling the rust belt ? What the Senates health plan look like ? No worries on Govplan
you just voted to kill people... what will those celebrations look like?
@SenateMajLdr 

@SenateMajLdr Nice going.  You just hurt millions of Americans who have pre-existing conditions.  #MAGA my ass!  Be ashamed!
@SenateMajLdr what a disgrace you all are. You represent all not just the evangelicals!
Shame on you.  Hurting millions and getting ready to #MakeAmericaSickAgain
@maddow The GOP needs to know how many U.S. citizens will suffer as a result of you all selling yourselves to big health/pharma.
GOP seems 2 be operating as if it got a majority of Dem/GOP vote-either GOP isn't good with figures or is in denial or r s
Actually, the Electoral College voted to change the status quo. Over 65 million, 48.2% of the voters,wanted to continue w/ Obama
Over 50% of the Dem/GOP voters voted not 2 change status quo-or at least have a plan 2 present if GOP wants 2 change status quo
@MaryKaehr stop saying replace. Reform health insurance, open up competition and get government out of the way.
Replace with what?
@SenateMajLdr Where is th replacement, you liars? You are all slime mold
The majority of Americans voted to KEEP the ACA! It's just the Republicans who want to take our healthcare away. #SaveACA
Most of us would prefer you just fix its faults rather than roll us back to the old days where poor people had to die
Where is the replacement plan?
liars. You should replace, then repeal.
Please tell the American people what you plan to replace it with.
this mean I have to watch CNN??? You are killing me Speaker Ryan!!
@SenateMajLdr we can start sending all our medical and hospital bills to u. Take it out of ur war chest and bribes from lobbyists
@SenateMajLdr I will personally go door to door when ur up for reelection and show people your crappy record for helping citizens
Your replacement IDEAS will not help those you are dumping into the drain. They will die, have no care, no help, no hope
With what? We're watching you. You work for us!
OK. BUT. WHATS. THE. ALTERNATIVE. You'd think with it asked so many times you guys would get people just want an alternative plan
It's likely that just being female will be a pre-existing condition
It is remarkable how much the GOP can accomplish in the dead of night. Too bad it wasn't for the good of the people.?
Get ready for bigger increases, higher drug prices, less coverage from garbage plans.
what exactly does that mean????

@SenateMajLdr #SinglePayer
more than 65+ Million of us voted for @HillaryClinton. #Russia voted to change the status quo.
@senatemajldr Thats not what we want. You have no mandate to repeal. Overwhelming majority approves of ACA. FIX it. U broke it
@SenateMajLdr You are only ready to repeal and far from ready to replace.
@SenateMajLdr 49 percent of American want to keep Obamacare, 30 percent repeal & 21 percent want to expand on Obamacare.
@SenateMajLdr ppl you got what you wished for no insurance with no replacement plan nothing you ppl useless
@SenateMajLdr No replacement plan 7 years of trying to repeal Why no plan brilliant of your party let ppl die right
replace with what?
65 million voted against your egos and repeal. Three million more than Trump. THAT IS NOT A MANDATE! Look up the definition.
thank you.
GOP ur about 2 cause ur own down fall in history, America's people got the midterms & all u do now can be reversed after ur gone
GOP will throw America under the bus just because they can.
How very sad.  Why does GOP want America to be sick and broke?
when you repeal with no plan to replace at same time, people can die! No insurance for preexisting conditions  and young adults
you have had years to develop new health plan. No plan. Fix what is broken without pulling health insurance for 22 million!
there was no vote to change the status quo. Trump winning Electoral College and losing popular does not mean vote to repeal ACA
@CNN @MSNBC The GOP are LIARS. The people have sent millions of petitions, thousand of calls, tweets & emails NOT to repeal. Listen to them
Trump the Russian mole is now going to be President of USA. Voters want this?
@PRyan @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @SenateDems No spinning what people want, status quo change was GOP doing nothing & obstructing
How many emails, petitions & calls have you boys received asking you NOT to repeal ACA. Ryan refused to receive calls & petitions last week
@NBCNews @ABC @CBSNews @CNN @MSNBC GOP is trying to spin this to justify what they are doing. This is what they want, not the people
Finally happening please get the job done
@SenateMajLdr
@SenateMajLdr You are full of BS you lied to Americans & have no plans to replace ACA for 7 yrs #ACA
@SenateMajLdr I hope birds poop on all of you. 
@SenateMajLdr so you repeal before you have put forth any replacement not a lot of #CommonSense very sad. Where is the plan?
actually 2.8 million more , the majority rejected the idea of repealing ACA.
the majority of American citizens want to keep ACA. 63%
@SenateMajLdr Give people the best deal possible on every level & good luck this year my friends!
@SenateMajLdr Pharmaceuticals companies shouldn't be able to price as high whenever they like!
@SenateMajLdr Plus we need to repeal and replace the same day!
you miss the point. They wanted change from your deaf ears
@SenateMajLdr yes and we want a healthcare bill that allows @StateFarm @Geico & @Progressive to be able to sell health insurance!
Some States didn't do their part. Drive prices up but settling down now
So Medicare for all now? Single payer is clearly the way to go.
SHAME ON YOU!!!
you know being addicted to taking big business pole is a pre-existing condition, right?
ur putting ego before American ppl. You're too selfish & hate Obama to the point where you will make 20m ppl suffer
I've got priv ins. never taken any handout from govt.I want a fair chance to live.My ins gives me that chance. U have no right
@SenateMajLdr No this is a lie. No replacement after 6 years of taking about one. YOU HAVE NO REPLACEMENT. Lie, lie, lie
@SenateMajLdr  you let it happen before having a clear plan to replace it with ? So you let cancer pts die w/o ins? Thats a crime
@SenateMajLdr SHOW THE TRUTH! THAT RATES ROSE DUE TO GREEDY INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THEIR LOBBYISTS!!!!
What is it being replaced with?? People are counting on that healthcare. You're the fucking worst.
wrong--3 million more Americans voted against the kind of harmful change you want!
no repeal without replace. No repeal without replacement! 20 million will let their voices and actions be heard! No repeal !!
@SenateMajLdr we wanted cooperation.  No bickering politocians
@GOP @SenateDems @SenToddYoung @SenDonnelly @TheDemocrats do NOT repeal #Obamacare #ACA you will put millions at risk
@SenateMajLdr I hear--glad Obamacare going and happy ACA will still be in effect. Think you have a problem?
tell Mitch MCconnel and John MCCain that
So far you have committed $350 billion to pay for repeal, and have absolutely nothing to show for a replacement. Dangerous. #NoPlan
this is false.  You are risking lives. You HAVE risked libes
@SenateMajLdr what is your replacement..work in healthcare..so many people helped..what is replacement?
Americans didn't vote to be refused health insurance because of preexisting conditions. GOP handing a gift to lobbyists.
@SenateMajLdr replace it with what?
You people are ridiculous.
@SenateMajLdr Americans cast more votes for Democrats than Republicans in 2016. Watch it: gerrymandering won't last much longer.
@SenateMajLdr Where is your replacement plan? Americans want to see it now!
@SenateMajLdr No, Americans voted for progress by a margin of 3 mil, the electoral college voted against status quo. #NoMandate
@SenateMajLdr Just like Putin, GOP only destroys -- ACA, publ health, lives. Not OK. Stop while u can. Country over party
Lest you forget, your president and his plans for this country lost the popular vote by 3 million.
@SenateMajLdr please drain the swamp
Reveal THEN Repeal!
@SenateMajLdr LOL! More people voted for HRC.
So selfish.
Why not leave the plan that is working, and helping millions while you work out what a "replacement" is. #GOPWillKillAmercans
@SenateMajLdr With what you stupid bastards??? You are hurting, perhaps killing, real people! We should take your insurance away
@SenateMajLdr People face that they DON'T CARE. GOP  owns millions of shares of insurance, energy and coal companies.
.@SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr would love to see the all important REPLACE part of this plan...
U better check on that again. The MAJORITY WANT IMPROVEMENT. NOT REPEAL!
I didn't vote for a Russian puppet theater to take away MY healthcare.
Repeal your your tax paper paid health care too .You have no replacement to replace the ACA
No, you all cutting programs Americans depend on IS the status quo. You are right that people are sick of that!
@SenateMajLdr 2018 is coming when trump crashes and burns he will take you with him
@senatemajldr Here's your "Death Panel" America; it's called the GOP. Murderers.
#obamacare #GOPdeathpanel #Republicandeathpanel
@SenateMajLdr have you no shame repealing ACA will leave 20 million Americans without healthcare while you benefit from free care
MORE LIES FROM THE LYING LIARS The @SenateGOP SO FAR OUT OF TOUCH WITH REAL AMERICANS. SHAME. Sins of the Fathers #TheResistance
@SenateMajLdr what is your replacement plan?
@SenateMajLdr we have a constitutional crisis on our hands and you first goal is to take away medical insurance. Disgusting
@SenateMajLdr No they most certainly did not. You are a liar and a treasonous hack. Children will die because of you.
Are you hearing our call that you better have a replacement before repealing? Don't play politics with my health!
Republicans are only doing this because they're racist they didn't like the black man in office telling him what to do so now it's Revenge
Take my profile photo and use it. Fits you much better these days. PS...soonest...YOU'RE FIRED!
It should include the Obamacare taxes many of us non millionaires are paying to fund those receiving subsidized Obamacare!
Replace? Y does the Fed think it knows HC so much better? Let the market handle this #masterminds. #Levithan
you're. Ready to repeal, not replace.
Please, those of us who currently benefit from the ACA want to see / hear the replacement plan.  Where is it?
@SpeakerRyan 
Senate's ready, how about the House?
key word there: replace. Must be better, more or = coverage, no denials for preexist cond. Haven't seen a plan for that. No HSAs.
no they didn't, Americans voted to elect the first female president by 3 million.
More voted to change the status quo to HRC than to DJT. STOP pretending to have a mandate.
yet you have no replacement. You're having a hard time telling the American people you're for full privatization. Cowards.
we heard the call of your authoritarianism and we decline. Give the ppl a revote as we requested
Tell that to the 20 million on it. You better have an affordable plan. Tax Credits are not when you can't afford premiums.
