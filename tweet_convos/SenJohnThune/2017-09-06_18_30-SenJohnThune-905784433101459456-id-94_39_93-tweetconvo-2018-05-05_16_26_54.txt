Rep principal#1 take from the elderly,children programs,give 2 corporations, buy us med insurance,take it away from them,pay us w/their taxs
Old tired ideas..tax reform requires the wealthy to pay more, businesses to pay thier share, and the GOP to quit lying.
Those five principles are - screw the 90%. Screw our education system. Screw our infrastructure. Screw healthcare. And screw America. Yep.
You republicans talk a lot of crap we voted for you to pass our agenda you have done nothing you didn't even repeal Obamacare nightmare
#6 And we MUST LIE to the American people to sell it.  As with all other policies since 11.9.16
FRAUD SENATOR/Congress WE 99% know who you are? TRAITOR & DEEP STATE OPERATIVE. TIME TO PROSECUTE YOU ALL & FREE USA
Sounds good until you realize most of the cuts go to 1% and companies.Give it all to the middle class, we will spend it and create demand!
Did u know there are hurricanes? DACA threatened? All u care about is getting bigger tax break for yourself as u take from everyone else.
You keep saying these things but you don't produce get on board with the president's agenda or you're out
Your job is to PAY for the function of government which was not listed. DO YOUR F*CKING JOB and balance the budget
How can you have a serious debate on taxes, while the chief executive of the country is hiding his?

"Good talk Dad. Ya think Mom'll buy it"?

#TaxReform SHOULD follow those principles, but that's not @GOP way.
We're living the nightmare of the last tax plan. The past 30+ yrs slow salary growth, no pension plan, a recession, etc. & #TheRichProsper
1. An inability to show the @POTUS tax returns?
2. An inability to request and/or demand @POTUS tax returns? 
#getaspine #exGOP
That's really more important?
Isn't it ignorance to say "Any ...TaxReform the Republican Senate passes ... principles" since it needs bipartisan collaboration to succeed?
Glad to know my friend @bijouhills works for this guy
See if you can do your job!!!  We will not forget.
Yap yap yap... Thune is great at yapping but horrible at doing his job... Trump is tired of dealing with the incompetence in republicans
I'm guessing these 5 pizzas have more principles than any @GOP tax plan.
Isn't the use of "principles" and "Republican" in the same sentence an oxymoron? Maybe it's just moronic.
1. 'Increase jobs & economic growth'
Are you going to LEGISLATE that corporations HAVE TO create jobs if they get a tax cut? That's Idiotic!
Jobs are created by consumption. And consumption is created by being confident you have a job tomorrow and having the money to spend. But
cutting taxes for corporations alone will not guarantee they'll create jobs. That trickle down Reaganomics theory never worked before. It
just make the rich richer. 
2. Increase American competitiveness' - last 15 years our corporations paid an AVERAGE of 22% or got a REFUND!
WE, Who the H... do U think is the WE!! U'v already made the Pres. make a deal with the DEVIL DEMS!! DUFUS!!!
"We love Trump's economic plan and how popular it is. We're still going to obstruct it because we're big govt shills"
A shame to see ignorant people turn on one of our former stars. You may have last your stardom, but not your common snese.
http://1.Rich  get richer
2.Bankers over workers.
3.Special interests win.
4.TaxRegressive.
5.F the poor.
Did I guess right?
It's most irresponsible attitude from republicans giving to the rich billions of dollars on tax cut,in the same time,ask to raise debt limit
Listen to the real five (actually 6) reasons:
Greed. Greed. Greed. Greed. Greed.
#waekideas
So tax breaks for the rich to have competitive International companies and Fain ignorance that the middle class will have to pay the loss

You guys are really pushing me to switch to independent. Start doing ur freaking jobs!
Taxes are tough. We have the Rep. voters who work for a living and Dem voters who vote for a living. Dems need high taxes to support voters
GOP is suffering from a credibility problem. All y'all do is lie and try to hurt minorities, women, children and the poor. Save your breath
Illegals, Illegals, Illegals & Fuck Americans. We been watching & there is the five you care about.
Let's stop with the usually political pandering and rhetoric. Just pass a one page Tax Act with low rates and get out of the way.
I just worry that if this is something good for Americans, @SenJohnMcCain will vote no! We don't need undercover Dems in OUR party!
For all Dems: Read "Obama Instituted the 'Greatest Transfer of Wealth in History' to the 1%" on


Keep AMT and Estate taxes.  Fund our country.   No 15% tax decreases for high income earners.  Invest in the US
Why? 1/2 the country doesn't even pay taxes, so ALL taxpayers deserve a break. We don't believe in punishing someone for being successful.


Trump jumped in and got the three issues done for McConnell and Ryan
Why do you support white supremacists?!??  #HR496

Democratic Senators are asking DHS why the Trump administration repeatedly de-emphasizes domestic terror attacks. 


GOP should probably look up the definition of principles because, clearly, they have NO CLUE what they r.

I hope one of those five includes @realDonaldTrump releasing his tax returns #TaxReturns #DontheCon #LiarInChief #TrumpCrimeFamily #GOP
OK!!! show us the fucking plan. stop marketing. Do SOMETHING. Try to be honest and fair about it. And adult-like. Respectful. Try it.
I guess the president is done trying to get republicans to #DoYourJob ! #VoteThemOut
Just get it DONE! Boot @SenJohnMcCain if necessary AMERICA is WAITING! #MAGA SHOULD BE SIMPLE @FoxNews @FoxBusiness @realDonaldTrump 
Getting rid of a #TraitorMcCain is a great idea. I still don't know why he"qualifies" as Republican... I hope the Lord takes him back soon!
1: Funnels $ to Trump
2: Funnels $ to millionaires 
3: Funnels $ to billionaires 
4: Steals $ from my 401K
5: Steals $ from 99% of Americans

No they won't. Your just doing "#taxreform" to please your donors and screw over the middle class & poor
How will it screw over the poor? 1/2 this country doesn't pay taxes so that won't change. They should do away with some loopholes though.
This is an issue for all Americans. @SenateDems get on board
Like 1 giving trump and rich tax breaks, 2 give co's more cash for CEOs, 3 no cuts for poor or mids, no cut to sen salary, etc!  Liars!
Are you sure  Schumer & Pelosi are on board? Looks like you people can't do anything without them.
Any legislation on #TaxReform should start with seeing the top five creditors of the @POTUS via his #TaxReturns.  Start there.
Well, we're going to be out of luck then, because we all know the .@GOP has lost ALL of their principles - if they ever even HAD any.
You asses need to BACK our President or YOU are all gone
Tax cuts do NOT create jobs, it REMOVES $$ from the economy. Demand creates jobs. And you clowns know it and are selling lies.
There may still be some Randian true believers. I would agree with you that mist probably do know better.
GOP party is a Jerry springer shitshow side circus! #CountryB4Party #DoYourJob #ImpeachtheClown #TraitorTrump #Espionage
NO tax "reform" until ALL politicians reveal their TAX RETURNS and DONORS since they first ran for office. Then the People will see.
1.$ for 1% 2. Screw the middle class 3.unilateral, secret process 4. MAGA 5. Did I mention screw the middle class?
If anybody is to blame for screwing the middle class it's those corporations that ship our jobs overseas
This is the tax rate over time. The rich should pay their share. They do NOT need a tax cut
The rich will never pay there fair share of you tax them to much they just park there money overseas or Cancun no way around it
Five @GOP principles? What the hell are you talking about... GOP and principles...? You've lost me.
Any Politician and Principles. An oxymoron???
1. Austerity for the poor 
2. Austerity for the middle class 
3. Bucketfuls of $$ for the wealthy
4. $$ for corps
5. Please the Kochs
Most of the wealth is controlled by companies run by democrates like Microsoft Intel Facebook Google Apple ships there jobs overseas to Chin
Exactly! Just take a look at Obama's, Hillary's & Dems' donors. All major corporations support Dems who give them cheap illegal alien labor!
Not likely to pass then.  #greed
Such BS. Your real 5 principles are:
1. Enrich wealthy.
2. Enrich wealthy.
3. Enrich wealthy.
4. Enrich wealthy.
5. Enrich wealthy.

No tax cuts for the 1%! It is irresponsible and damaging to the middle class!
No it's not! I'm very poor but 1/2 the country pays NO taxes, so ALL taxpayers should get a break! What's damaging is not enough people pay!
The way you guys work, 5 principles is too many. Break it down into 1 principle and pass a clean bill -- with Nancy & Chuck's inputs.
Fake
Then it will not pass.
By 5 principles, you must mean white supremacy five times.
Insults don't get you anywhere if all you can do is insult your I'm a Republican and white supremacist have no place in today's society
“...and that three or more become a Congress...”  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TGbKfkwGA …
Lol. Republicans have no principles.
