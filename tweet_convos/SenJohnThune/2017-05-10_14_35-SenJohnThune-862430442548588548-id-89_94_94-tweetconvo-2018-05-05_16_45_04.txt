Did anybody ever think that Obamacare was so poorly written it was going to fail. Then the government could take over.....
 And tomorrow Blue Cross Blue Shield will be the next to announce.  Obamacare: you can poke a stick in it.  Pulse is negative!
They R's can't contain their excitement
Only because of the chaos you Republican created.
..... and run the ACA as a single-payer healthcare system
insurances pulling out because of the uncertainty the GOP is creating with your repeal-and-replace. fix it do UR job
LOL
Well, @GOP says let the free market take control.  States can establish healthcare exchanges w/o Aetna.  Plenty of competition for $$$$.
Aetna and senate working together
Thanks to the House Republicans refusing to fix it for 7 yrs...you people created the failures so I think it's time to do your job, FIX IT
#FullRepeal as promised every root and branch of O'care #KeepYourPromise
Can fed regulate delivery of Hc-no Can Fed provide HC-no Can fed order u 2 buy HC-No Can fed mandate drs records give dir access to hhs-No
@SenJohnThune @business Aetna makes plenty of money don't feel bad for them.  Just fix Obamacare
Just as it threatened to do if the federal government didn't approve Aetna's merger. Why crow about corporate blackmail?
when does your term end?
This is another reason to repeal MuslimCare
@SenateDems @BarackObama is a F** LIAR . "If u like yr doctor, u can keep yr doctor. If u like yr plan, u can keep yr plan"
Aetna CEO also supports hving the conversion abt single payer healthcare! Let's get that rolling

That's great that Aetna wants to pull out of the exchange in 18. They are a terrible company to deal with. Not making enough 4 shareholders
Because of your obstruction. The deaths of tens of thousands of Americans will be on you head. Trumpcare #AmericanGenocide
Maybe we should have nationalized healthcare so profit-seeking companies don't try to mitigate their losses? #ACA @SenatorRounds
I.S. needs a single payer system and we need usury laws placed on pharmaceuticals to protect the disadvantaged.
Today I heard an idiot leftist coast liberal blame obamacare failure on Trump. Thinks 8 years is not enough time for a "market" to settle. 
Aetna, the worst Insurance in the wprld
While this only affects a few states, it is primarily due to the uncertainty created by the @GOP. Insurers taste blood in the water
Single Payer Universal Coverage & get the profit motive out of healthcare & remove GOP from the Ins. lobby teat
Of course they will. With you guys in office why would they stay.
And Democrats don't want to repeal it, bunch of idiots
Good bc they are a hassle to deal with.
Are you guys in the @senategop gonna throw a kegger over this one, too?
more propaganda. This is happening because of your actions on repeal
#ThanksObama
That's what happens when you don't negotiate with them.
Because the paid you to rip us off
Trump should just wait this out until it implodes. Then maybe Dems would help get it right, though I won't hold my breath about that.
Nonsense. R's introduced a bill in House only. No legislation yet changed anything. D's will always own Ocare, which ruined h/c coverage
Blue Cross/Shield is a much better company than Aetna, so they can take over. Article says this move announced as GOP dismantles ACA. Shame!
Thanks, GOP, for driving Aetna out...
insur company bites the dust and still Dems and the media wants our POEPLE to keep paying more for Obamacare no heart
YES- WHO WILL ONE OF THE RICHEST INSURANCE CO THAT WILL BENEFIT $$$$$$$$$GREATLY AT THE EXPENCE  OF ORDINARY PEOPLE!!
You guys keep poking at it and raising funding issues that make insurers nervous. No surprise here; you are killing health care for all.
Come 2018 Aetna's killing Americans
#Singlepayer
Disgusting that you have caused this uncertainty and you celebrate it.
Have to wonder what kind of back room deals Aetna made with the GOP
You can't put sugar in the gas tank then declare the car is a lemon! 
In midst of proven 45 Russian ties WILL ANY GOP  STEP UP & DEFEND OUR DEMOCRACY? What will it take for American democracy to matter to GOP?
So... why would you allow them to do this? You see, YOU are ultimately responsible for allowing these insurers to pull out.
@hotair Breaking news: The @GOP has no conscience and care nothing for democracy. Oups, my bad, this is not news
Fix the ACA. Assure them of subsidies & stabilize market. Healthcare & ACA is NOW on you and you will pay a huge price
GOP: Your 7 years of undermining confidence in healthcare exchanges are paying off! Tally the win in dead constituents and gloat. Congrats!
Sounds like another beer party in the rose garden.
The Democrats planned for the ACA collapse in order to justify single payor
I d mind an independent investigation into trumps treason NOW!!
And how much did Aetna & its execs & major shareholders donate to Trump campaign & inauguration? Asking for a friend...
Why are you allowing them to pull out of states.. is it because they want to merge with HUMA instead?
It's almost like #Obamacare isn't working or something.  #duh #CommonSense

Fix the risk corridors for < $10 billion. Easy.
I wonder if it had to do with system uncertainty created by a Congress unwilling to correct problems or support it.
Thanks, Trump :(
