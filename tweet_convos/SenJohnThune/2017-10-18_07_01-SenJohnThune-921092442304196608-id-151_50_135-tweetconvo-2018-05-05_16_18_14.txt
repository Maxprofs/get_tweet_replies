Thune wants you to get shot by madmen.
Why do SD folks elect him?
Why are you giving breaks to the 1% most if working families are your focus? You’re just a GOP yes-man.
Not with your current proposal. Only wealthy and corps will benefit. The R party has become the party of liars.
FAIR TAX!!!!
Or just fat cat corporate tax cuts? No worries, I’m sure the corporations will be generous with their windfall.
Yeah when HELL freezes over.
Such lies.
#TaxReform for bigger paychecks, HECK YEAH!  To bad it's a pipe dream unless you're in the top 2% richest of the country.  I'm not.
Thanks for the good laugh. You are truly the most shameless people on the planet.  Call Kansas.  It didn't work then..and it won't work now.
Liar. Trickle down is a lie to make the rich richer.
more Bull from TRUMP and his party of CLOWNS !!
Good luck with that, @SenJohnThune
Again, the middle class will pay for the CEO parasites
You've all lost your way!!!.  Thank GOD some are starting to come around.  2018 you lose.
Companies pay outsourced factory folks in Mexico as low as $7 a day. Seriously, we want that back here???
Flat Tax w/no deductions or credits is only fair tax.

No #TaxReform for the #DraftDodger @realDonaldTrump. He gave so little and he want more from the American People.
Liars! My taxes will go UP, just like they have with EVERY Republican tax cut!
Let's see Trump's tax returns, no deal till america see Trump tax returns
In Mexico some Folks working border factories make $7 per day. Managers make tons as do CEO's.
I doubt it.
If stock market rise is due to proposed tax reform. Who you think benefits most. Clue: It’s not the middle class.
Get your #wimpy asses in gear. Do something for a change.
Impeaching Trump will bring us much needed relief. The GOP is broken. #remembernovember2018
not going to believe 1 word until all of congress gets on Obummer care removing YOUR waver yet forcing WE the PPL on 2 it by LAW
Not until we see Trump tax returns.
Rich families you mean. @SenateDems @SenMajLdr @SenWarren

They had better get off their political high horse and do something besides take a vacation and obstruct POTUS!
Liars
BULLSHIT
Agree 100%
Not Trump's Tax plan Pro Rich
Bullshit GOP, all your Tax Reform will do is fill your already full pockets you greedy bastards...reckoning will come next year...
In your dreams!
Caution; RINOS & Never Trumpers!
Liars, you people do not care about the working people, the poor people, you only care about your paid sponsors, evil is rampant in the GOP.
relief doesn't come from taxing the rich less but forcing your cronies to pay a living wage-increase tax base & purchase of goods & services
By using Trump's and Ryan's 2015-2016 Tax returns, show us exactly how they are going to work for wealthy?
No guarantees that will happen in the current proposals. Let’s see real numbers and real impact. Or are parts of the plan still secret?
Provide proposed effective tax rates for upper, middle & lower income workers; bracket rates don’t tell whole story & can be misleading
REPLACE THIS DANGEROUS, MENTALLY UNFIT PRESIDENT!!! COUNTRY BEFORE PARTY!!!!!!
No it won’t.the CEA study from 2004 when you did the same thing proves it won’t!
Ya think $200-400 will bring relief to middle class, or 20%+ to the 1% corps will bring the relief. GOP donors pressuring you to pay back?
If you think either party has the “backs” of Americans...you’re wrong. The people deserve better!  We are witnessing a political power war
LIAR


BLS: Americans Spend More on Taxes Than Food and Clothing Combined http://sumo.ly/F2WC  via @cnsnews #FAIRtax  #taxreform to #MTFA
When will you serve America and impeach his ass out of that office? He keeps proving over and over again that he doesn't belong there!
Why don't you grow some BALLS and do something about @POTUS and the idiotic things he says and does? He is a world wide embarrassment!
More Lies, for shame.

Why did you leave our soldier behind to die? Why was it the French military who found him? Where were you, and where was Tillerson? 
Liars. U r gutting medicare to give the 1% more breaks. U r redistributing money from the middle to the 1%. Trickle down is a lie
You know that's a flat out fucking lie and so do we. By this time, why do you even bother with lip service?
Prove it! #MathNotRhetoric should be simple to show us on real forms, heck maybe using your data?
@GOP trickle down pee on our heads calling it rain. Has NEVER worked EVER. Wonder if Ike would even recognize the GOP now? Pretty sure not.
America growing exhausted by your constant lying. Y'all need to resign!
@SenateGOP @HouseGOP @realdonaldtrump
FABRICATE THE DETAILS OF #TaxReform bill.

#TaxReform heavily supports #wealthy 1%
@KochBrothers @gop

American families need relief from filing obligations, high taxes, penalties, liens, levies, prosecutions - Pass FAIR TAX at 15% rate!!!
Not today. Not tomorrow. Not next week. Not this month. Not next month. Not this year. Not next year. NO CUTS 4TRUMP
Pres. Trump dropped 92 spots on Forbes' annual list of the 400 wealthiest people in America. http://abcn.ws/2ijHlCf  
You are just kicking yourselves out of office in 18 remember more people voted againt potus than for   your changes in 18 are slim
Please use our tax $ to rebuild Houston, Florida, Puerto Rico, ok thx
Vote on It--Quit Talking
How about passing it so we can find out. Tired of hearing about it.
Actually, it increases taxes on the middle income earning family of four by $4k while giving a huge break to the super wealthy. #lieslieslie
Let's wait until all investigation on your exectuvive branch has been completed. Your sense of urgency after 31 years doesn't sit well.
No it won't. The only thing that will bring relief to our country is the #25thAmendmentNow and you KNOW it. #ComplicitGOP
As Obamacare "repeal and replace" did?

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr
Details and hearings in congress when?
Follow through by congress when?
Fair taxes for all when?
By raising the wage right cause my wages tax free aren't enough to pay for basic costs of living stop trying to push #CorporateWelfareReform
I’m pretty sure you mean “8yrs of recover after the Bush admin, including tax cuts for wealthy & de-regulation” -sound familiar?

GET ON THE TRUMP TRAIN! Build the wall, end Obamacare, no amnesty, tax cuts. YOU COULD CHANGE THE WORLD FOR GOOD BUT U R PETTY! #MAGA #trump
Not a fucking chance that the Republican #TaxReform will bring relief to working families. It will only increase the wealthy's wealth.
Not #TrickleDown its #SiphonUP
#Trumps #taxreform is #TaxFraud 
The Next #Trump Bankruptcy is the #USA!
Thread @SenSanders 
Tax Cuts will create excess liquidity, FED has normalized monetary policy. TaxCuts= ratehike. pay tax or pay banks more
Wrong ! The top 1% will get 80% of the tax breaks. We don’t want it . Bye Felicia
You need to reform your party  Graft Collusion with Russian s Obstruction  Prejudice Mendacity and the list goes on
BS.  More cuts for rich at expense of low & middle.

No, it won’t. It will bring “relief” to the rich. We’re not stupid.
This will do very little but give tax brakes to the wealthy. They are already are doing well and I dont see the trickle down.
Are you blind to the chaos that is this presidency or just complicit in it to push whatever ridiculous legislation you can through?
A different spokesperson every day does not change the facts. This tax "reform" does not help the middle class. #rollagain
please cut welfare! Only 20% of us pay for 85% of this bloated government's cost! We who work r tired of it!
Stop. We know you’re lying. #NotOnePenny The #GOP are liars, cheats & thieves protecting a serial abuser. It’s not #TaxReform it’s a joke
What about the relief society needs as VICTIMS of VILANCE for the care & treatment many will need the rest of THIER lives REP.Scolia has
George W PROVES YOU WRONG - RECESSION! Reagan's "trickle down" economics has FAILED repeatedly. Billionaires can't have EVERYTHING!
Bull Shite, it will mean very little to workers, but it will be a great boon to the rich and 1% & cost the neediest dearly to enrich the 1%
Does this chart look like it helps the middle class?
Where did you get that?
So let's suspend reality for a moment and say you're right (you're wrong) and that this proposal lowers taxes for the middle class.
The simple facts of the math: You say the average increase will be $4000. You get this by shifting around a set of deductions.
But then you raise costs of health care by 30%. Family of 4 spends @ $2000 a month on the exchange. That's an additional $600/mo, $7200/yr
REALITY is that someone has to pay for the massive cuts you're giving the rich. Which means you'll kill those extra deductions quickly
Can anyone call that comment for what it is, i.e., Bull Shite!Tax reform will be a boon to the rich & the 1%,& have little effect on workers
Our country is suffering from numerous and expensive natural catastrophes. And you want to give tax cuts to those who need them least? Jesus
Not to mention the ungoing wars with threats of new ones that profit the MIC only.
Tax reform or go home!
So... the best way to serve the #poor ,who subsist on the table scraps of the #rich, is to give the rich bigger meals?
no!  Give them a job! Let them pay tax too! Bottom 50% of Americans pay no tax!!!

The FY18 Budget gives $1.5TRIL in tax cuts to the richest Americans. It cuts about the same from Medicaid & Medicare. Whose side are you on? 

1/Trump's move to stop CSR payments to insurance companies hits Trump-won (red + most purple) states harder than blue. 
#TrumpTaxScam 
This appears to most of us to be a tax cut for the richest 1% of Americans...
of course!Who do you think pay the most taxes? Why should they be penalized because they work

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 cut corporate rate from 46% to 34% and wages fell. 
You REALLY want to offer #AmericanFamilies relief? Then #DoYourJob & #Remove #Erratic @realDonaldTrump from office before it's too late...
Please he’s the only thing helping this country right now.

As Richard mentions, Treasury deleted its own study showing most corporate tax cuts go to profits, not labor income. Orwellian stuff. https://twitter.com/RichardRubinDC/status/919868928763088896 …
NOT TRUE. This bill will direct MOST of the savings to the richest 1%.  Stop deceiving voters.
because they are the ones paying the taxes! 50% pay no tax now. Should they get a tax cut????

You're a joke
You're selling the integrity of our democracy and your duty to hold an incompetent tyrant accountable for tax cuts for the rich
