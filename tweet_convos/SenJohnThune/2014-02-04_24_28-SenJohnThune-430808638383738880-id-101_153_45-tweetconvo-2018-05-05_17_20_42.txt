@EricCantor @Senate_GOPs oooo good now add that on top of the 1.7 million out here already starving. Brilliant idea not to #RenewUI smfh!
@EricCantor YOU ARE A LIAR, MR. CANTOR.. AND YOUR BANKER WIFE TOO... PAY YOUR TAXES FOR A CHANGE...  http://WWW.JOS1945.COM 
With his tweets about the CBO report and the ACA, @EricCantor  demonstrates his dismal reading comprehension. @cspanwj
@dogcanyon @EricCantor @cspanwj Please, oh please, run that guy out of the GOP leadership.
@JamesinSELA @EricCantor @cspanwj There's something really wrong with that guy. Not just an asshole. Something seriously wrong.
@EricCantor Is it #treason when the #GOP lie?  Why do you do it?
@EricCantor @Senate_GOPs You should be fired for stupidity
@EricCantor @Senate_GOPs Then win the Senate, hold the House and REPEAL O/Care and IMPEACH Obama!
@EricCantor @Senate_GOPs All lies The CBO said people would give up 2nd jobs because they are going to have insurance why must you lie???
@EricCantor Nearly 3x as many will lose their homes, cars and who knows what else with Reps blocking EUI.  Lost my vote this year.
@EricCantor your schizophrenic statement shows a lack of intellectual understanding of the ACA. Can't wait until 2016 to #flipadistrict.
@EricCantor …because many no longer need to work until they drop, just to have healthcare insurance! Please be honest and not misleading.
@EricCantor @Senate_GOPs Nearly 3X that crowd ARE already suffering. U could care less though. Worry about the hear and now #RenewUI now!
@EricCantor ALL of these people can afford insurance because we worked hard & I did for my sis and bro who died due to flaws. @BarackObama
Please stop lying, @EricCantor: ACA will NOT cause an “increase in unemployment” CBO notes declines “workers choose to supply.” #Learn2Read
@TeamCantor @PatriotJeeper I hope they remember and Vote Republican to strip Obama of his power to save America. Tell everyone do the same.
@EricCantor - - Many don't even have jobs.  Congress & Senate are just about talking points. Help the unemployed!!!!  What's w/ insurance?
@EricCantor What about the #2millionoutinthecold already suffering due to no #RenewUI how many kids affected? #shameful @CNN @nbc
@EricCantor   Started with Ronnie Reagan and the continued offshoring of our fucking American Jobs.  You GOP'ers are just real assholes.
@EricCantor By choice, because they can get health insurance without it. You should be ashamed, but then you wouldn't be GOP.
@EricCantor @Senate_GOPs  We aren't buying your bullshit any more.  I knew you'd push too far.
“@EricCantor: Thanks to Obamacare, ppl will be working jobs they *want*, not just jobs for coverage.  ”
@EricCantor Maybe you need to tell the whole truth Eric, instead half-truths and lies. #CBO
@EricCantor Most are probably on disability, social security, or work for the federal goverment already.
@EricCantor @Senate_GOPs not true
@EricCantor @Senate_GOPs You and your party spend more time bitching about what already is, than taking care of issues in front of you. 1845
@EricCantor You're such a stupid liar you don't deserve to live! Better make things right with God "for you never know the hour nor the day"
@EricCantor When good news regarding Obamacare comes out, why is it the stupid Republicans can't read to save their lives?  @BarackObama
@EricCantor  NOT TRUE Americans please read the CBO report for yourself, YouTube Paul Ryan and you'll find the speech on job lock
@EricCantor @Senate_GOPs Well Since You Know This PASS THE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS BILL!!!!
@EricCantor  ya know  Eric I am an independent who is Sick And  Tired of listening to with. ACA. And   Benghazi get a life.
@EricCantor @Senate_GOPs Meanwhile, Republicans walk on the backs of the longer unemployed. But want to tout more jobs are going to be loss?
@Senate_GOPs @SpeakerBoehner @RepJimRenacci  Republicans refer to supporting unemployed as immoral and a  disincentive.  #logintomemorybanks
.@EricCantor complete the sentence. ....if they so choose @GOP @TheDemocrats
@EricCantor Your full of crap
@EricCantor Why do you guys always complain about everything, yet offer no ideas, or solutions to solve anything? Frankly, I'm sick of it!
@EricCantor I might not agree with but I did think that you were smart.Sorry I overestimated you.You proved me wrong with this claim.
@EricCantor WRONG! the drop is “almost entirely” due to a reduction in “the amount of labor that workers choose to supply
@EricCantor #Factcheck: 3 Pinnochios for your misinformation. Ppl's #job CHOICE, not losing jobs. #Obamacare #ACA

@EricCantor Liar!
“@EricCantor: Remember this crowd? Because of ObamaCare, nearly 3x as many will no longer be working. ”
“@EricCantor:Remember this crowd? Because of ObamaCare,nearly 3x as many will no longer be working. ” fck the bullshit
@EricCantor @Senate_GOPs And how many more than this are locked up over the War on (some) Drugs simply bc we're mad at ya, not scared of ya?
@EricCantor @Senate_GOPs What do you people want? Jobs or healthcare because it can't fuckin' be both & preferably neither because we're GOP
@EricCantor Nonsense!!

@EricCantor @RepScottRigell Explain to me exactly how Obamacare is costing people jobs
@EricCantor Wonder how many who were there 5 years ago ask themselves "what have we done"?
@EricCantor @Senate_GOPs Bullshit, Eric.
@EricCantor @Senate_GOPs 'tsOkay, Eric - the Amnestified  immigrant workers can do the job.
@EricCantor Correct.  And if you do immigration it will be another 3x as many Americans not working.  Especially elected Republicans.
RT “@EricCantor: Remember this crowd? Because of ObamaCare, nearly 3x as many will no longer be working. ” #mapoli
@EricCantor @Senate_GOPs what you have done better
@EricCantor People leaving the work force is not the same as the job market shrinking. The jobs are still there but the boomers retired.
@EricCantor @Senate_GOPs What were you thinking when you voted for this farm bill. $17m for catfish oversight. SERIOUSLY?
@EricCantor @Senate_GOPs Like the pic, but WHO is doing anything about it? Current Washington D.C. & Congress is dead in the water!
@EricCantor @Senate_GOPs  you did nothing and continue to do nothing to help.  On to #amnesty instead of helping citizens
@EricCantor @Senate_GOPs when dinargate come that crowd will 10 fold Democrats Republicans who went silent with our pleas #wearethepeople
@EricCantor @Senate_GOPs What's the source for this claim?

@EricCantor is your answer no health care & reverse mortgages 4 a retirement plan , campaign reform is needed & citizen voices heard now
@EricCantor @Delmonicos_OK Nuremberg rally?
@EricCantor @Bhold226 And what did you do to stop it? You hold the power of the purse and refused to defund it. Shame on you!
@momarz @EricCantor Good point!
@EricCantor the only way Obamacare is going to put that many people out of work is when it gives business owners an excuse & scapegoat.
@EricCantor You fight Conservatism-WE (CONSERVATIVES) fight 
CORRUPT 
CRONY 
UNPRINCIPLED 
WEAK 
LYING PHONY COWARDS Like YOU! #DefundGOP
@EricCantor Clever wording. That way you can deny that you lied to GOP voters. People will CHOOSE to leave workplace. #FREEDOM
@EricCantor http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/obamacare-cbo-report-jobs …
@EricCantor And amnesty will multiply that.
@EricCantor I think you meant working fulltime, little brain
