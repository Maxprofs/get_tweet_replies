@SenJohnThune @pinecohen I used to think that Reid was like Eeyore....I was wrong even Eeyore has manners.
@Spiritlifter50 @SenJohnThune

@SenJohnThune @Reince They are untrue.
I will accept Horror Story Harry Reid's apology once he retires from the Senate..  @SenJohnThune @Linda18788
@SenJohnThune @GOPLeader Get lost your plan is worse.
@SenJohnThune @cathymcmorris GOP is so silly on this. Do you not get it yet? The average citizen thinks both parties stink.

@SenJohnThune @DickDadamo The voters of Nevada owes America an apology
@JustTom076 Do the D's actually think he is doing a good job as leader? Worst senate leader in my lifetime.
@DickDadamo Do the D's actually think?
@SenJohnThune @Reince . Good for Senator Thune for standing up & calling out Harry Reid, as the biggest hypocrite liar ( other than Obama) !
@SenJohnThune @GOPLeader He doesn't owe anybody an apology. You and the Koch Brothers are just spreading your propaganda.
@SenJohnThune He DESERVES a BOOT in the mouth!!! @Reince
@SenJohnThune Be a man.  Seek truth.  You know many stories pushed have been false.  Sure, there are people who will have bad deals
@SenJohnThune You Repubs would be so much better off if you just stop lying about #ACA 5 million now have healthcare!
@Nhilliard67 @SenJohnThune thing is that the #Koch's #HeritageFoundation wrote the law with #Alec.Now against it.#Racist lies from #elitists
@SenJohnThune @GOPLeader AMEN! Now if only you Republicans would only fight to repeal due  to  AGE DISCRMMINATION, Marital status!
@SenJohnThune @Reince Good luck with that. Both Reid and Obama are wannabe monarchs, and nobody is going to tell them anything different.
@SenJohnThune @Judy_Taya Reid IS untrue
@SenJohnThune @MichaelSteele he will say he is sorry as soon as ur party admits it lied about death panels!
@SenJohnThune @GOPLeader Many were untrue promoted by conservative pundits!  No apology needed  by Reid! Check your facts!
@SenJohnThune sounds good. how about providing a public insurance option to smooth things over?
@SenJohnThune @MichaelSteele @SenatorReid @SenateDems @SenSanders @SenatorBarb WOW a republican talking about 'untrue' stories GOP full lies
@SenJohnThune @MichaelSteele @SenatorReid @SenateDems @SenSanders @SenatorBarb HEY thune, GOP no nothing but feeding UNTRUTHS...WAKE UP!!!

@SenJohnThune @MichaelSteele   right needs to stop lying & putting  FALSE stories out about the ACA. All u have put forth have been debunked
@SenJohnThune Finally another Senator speaks out. Thank you. But speaking out on the Senate floor is where it needs to happen @OrwellForks
@SenJohnThune @MichaelSteele and how about your apology to the people me included that have benefited from the aca
@SenJohnThune @Reince Sen. Reid is 'untrue', 24/7. He owes me /my family an apology too! He's #clueless
@SenJohnThune @GOPLeader go Jump dude
@MichaelSteele @SenJohnThune Will you disavow all the other stories that were concocted by the anti ACA proponents, in specific terms?
@SenJohnThune @KevinBaisdon 5 Million liars can't be wrong!
@SenJohnThune @Reince Reid doesn't care about individuals, only his criticizers.
@SenJohnThune @MichaelSteele Could you provide some examples, as I only know of the Fox promoted untrue cases.
@SenJohnThune @Reince The GOP owes Americans an apology for their obstructionism and their arrogance.
@SenJohnThune @Reince Hooray! New outrage to keep me swollen red w/anger. Thanks for the fix!
How about  this: @SenJohnThune and @Reince owe an apology to Americans suffering under #Republicans. That seems more accurate to me.
.@SenJohnThune @GOPLeader Say this on the floor of the Senate and you've got a donation coming.
@SenJohnThune @GOPLeader ABC News has already established that AFP used used ACTORS in its anti-Obamacare TV ads. No apology necessary!
@SenJohnThune @GOPLeader he won't apologize.  We need YOU to make him pay a high PR/political price for his lie.
@SenJohnThune @GOPLeader he can keep his apology, I'd rather have his resignation
@SenJohnThune What is the gross income of these people?  Single person making 250K?
@SenJohnThune @GOPLeader an apology? Really? How about getting the damn law repealed instead of an apology from your *friend from Nevada*.
@SenJohnThune These people are real? They are not actors? Are they in GOP controlled states w/o Medicaid expansion?
@SenJohnThune @GOPLeader we're still waiting for apology over #GOPshutdown that Speaker Boehner admits was all on them?
Reid is a denier  how funny but then so is the rest of Washington @SenJohnThune @GOPLeader
@SenJohnThune why is it when you guys sling words @ each other you don't make sure the other see it by using their twitter/acc @SenatorReid
@SenJohnThune He'll do that just as Thune as pigs fly! Haha. Anyway, stop pretending to be offended you miserable piece of shit.
@SenJohnThune John I hope you decide to run for President. We need a new fresh approach.
