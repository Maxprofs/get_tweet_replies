@WhiteHouse @POTUS Trump isn't concerned about issues affecting ordinary people, as evidenced by his Cabinet picks
the MOST GREAT CABINET EVER
the most horrific grammar ever
did not know that I was in school
you've clearly never been.
WOW the GRAMMAR POLICE OFFICER what a difference you are making
Fighting ignorant and ill-informed Trump supporters
 anyway I can
Amazing! The Republicans are speaking out and defending Potus and us! Finally! Thank you! Keep it up! We need your voic
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Apparently, not the majority of Americans..also ?aren't Canadians and south and central Americans Americans
Whatever Pres Pussy Grabber has to say, I don't agree with.
You look awful. Are you ill?
@MrClassics101 @POTUS thanks you very much for your support senator
November 8, 2016 Americans voiced their vote for the man to lead our country. Please, get the GOP to UNITE with our POTUS
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Trump is doing is best to please 25% of registered voters. When does the 75% get something?
BOYCOTT SOUTH DAKOTA  #BoycottSouthDakota
OF COURSE THERE IS WORK TO OVERCOME THE MESS THAT OBAMA'S HISTORY OF BAD STUFF GOP EQUALS GREAT OPPORTUNITY PARTY
no war, no huge military budget, no oil pipelines & no wall. Retain Soc Sec & Healthcare. top 1% pay fair share taxes.
No mention of Jeff Sessions' lying under oath and what should be done about it though.
He didn't highlight his TAXES!!! The majority of the American people want to see those! What is he hiding? CROOK!
Did you hear anything concrete?
no. He forwarded his xenophobic view of the world. Unacceptable.
BS.  No mention of climate change, conflicts of interests, Russian connections.  Lied about clean air and water . . .
Does your constituency share these convictions as well, Senator?
hell no.
@208actor @POTUS Getting a full cabinet is starting to really matter to me.
Mr. Double Speaker, at least Prof. Erwin Corey had a heart (a big one), you've got a prune ....
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Thank you, Senator Thune! #AmericanSpirit
what a tool
@joycekevon @POTUS Good Morning Sir! and thank you
@RussellSaunder9 @POTUS yes he did unlike the DEMS
you ducks want to cut from programs that the old in our country need and give it to our already bloated military budget
Thank you Senator Thune. Repealing obamacare is a step away from socialism/communism and independence from the un.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS wrong!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS you are a monster and a moral sell-out
LOL
@k2patriot @POTUS yes
Great speech. You Senators get to work implementing his agenda and confirm his cabinet. Work faster, better
are you nuts???
Support Trump!!
how do you have enough time working for So Dak when you're too busy getting your pockets lined by current cab members
You mister and the republican rules committee are a national disgrace... !
@BOLG8TR @POTUS That's great. So when will ya'll give him a bill to sign? Like...ObamaCare repeal?
No more talk!!  Get it done!!
how would you know what matters to Americans, esp. South Dakotans?  No town halls, no responses to calls.  Wrong.
Now it's time for the Repubs in Congress to act.
Party before country  ehh , Comrade Senator.
Stand with our President and MAGA!
#townhall
@Mike_Beacham @POTUS
oh,hatred, bigotry,disdain for kids, the sick? Great job on making the US fascist & spitting on the constitution
'Matters Most' or 'Matters to Most'?  ACA has positive rating, unlike Congress.  Maybe keep both....
be careful, be very careful; remember Daschle-stopped working for SD'ns and started working for WA D.C.
@Rosie (2)A well known leader/activist opposing you just as you were presenting your 1st 'non'-SOTU/SOTU #TheResistance
@WhiteHouse @POTUS all he did was rest a speech that his non written discourse contradicts
you are out of touch with the entire human race and an embarrassment to your state.
Everything except the white elephant in the room. I mean, you didn't say one word about @Rosie. 
@WhiteHouse @POTUS of course there was no substance. Just mom and apple pie.  Typical republican lip service
So, where does the money come from if there are huge tax breaks and tax cuts? Cut the pork and riders.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS scary, I really dislike the Republicans more than I ever thought I would!
well after OBAMA  ( One Big Ass Mistake America ) DEMOCRATS MAKE ME ANGRY
Yup. Didn't say HOW. You guys never do. Just empty promises and waiting for us to forget. #DitchTheseRobots
DEMOCRATS are NO DIFFERENT at least PRESIDENT TRUMP is NOT a POLITICIAN
Give me a break! Do we really seem that stupid? You guys don't give a fig about us middle income people.
.@SenJohnThune @POTUS I heard bullet points and a 2020 campaign speech. Prove me wrong. #JointAddress
@WhiteHouse @POTUS not to me and I am an American. More like destroying America
Increased military spending does not matter to me and is unnecessary.
NO, IT IS NECESSARY. READ  "WHILE ENGLAND SLEPT" BY PRES. KENNEDY

EPIC FAIL. HERE"S what matters. ACA=YES EPA=YES ENVIRONMENT=YES BIG OIL=NO! ANTICORRUPTION=YES RUSSIA/DT INVEST.=YES
who gives a FUCK ABOUT EPA
I personally would like to have a president who literally makes me so sad about my own country.
we just had 8 years of that
YOU ARE CORRECT!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS the fact is Americans need to b represented & that's what we like about President Trump,Man of the People!
That's not what he did. The only issues that matter immediately are Trump's #taxes & Trump's ties to #Russia. That's it
Frumpy...shut up
We The People need to start SEEING real forward motion--not just keep being told "we will ____"
Vote Thorne out!!!!
What matters to me is clean air & water, civil rights, and getting racists & “Leninist” fascists out of the @whitehouse
We need to stop being legislated by Executive Orders.
OBAMA complete 8 years was NOTHING BUT EXECUTIVE ORDER & there was NO OBJECTIONS
Two wrongs don't make a right. And,  I was just as opposed to Obama doing crap like that.
I am so SICK OF THE President TRUMP WAR this kind WAR DID NOT HAPPEN WITH OBAMA
@WhiteHouse @SenJohnThune @POTUS more bullshit
OBAMA IS MORE BULL SHIT
Trump needs to stop attacking people--AND the media choices they like --as  "enemies" of anything.

@WhiteHouse @POTUS #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #JointAddress #Jointsession Unity
I don't recall this being a concern when the 44th Pres was in office.

(You just randomly tweet people your #insane #rants Seek help @jonbassett for your #mentalillness )@SenJohnThune @WhiteHouse @POTUS
Healthcare provider and institutional costs need to be reformed.
Funny how quick the libs exited. Must have had to get back to their homes surrounded by large walls to keep criminals out.
remember when you said he should drop out of the race?
Many more employers need to cover their employees with health insurance.
well if people would take RESPONSIBILITY they would have A JOB WITH INSURANCE  ( HS DROP OUT )
I heard ZERO details! At least he can read !
will Trumpcare include pre existing condition and eliminate lifetime max as well?
That was the first bullet point on healthcare.
All I heard was another campaign speech. 
Russian connections to our voting and to our government need investigating.
when HILLARY is in PRISON
Nonsense
