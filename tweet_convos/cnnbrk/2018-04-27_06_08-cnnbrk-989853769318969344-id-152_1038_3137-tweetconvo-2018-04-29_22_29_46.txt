Tour! Tour!
There IS a planned #ABBA world #tour, expected next year. BUT it will be #holograms of their 1970's selves backed by a live band, they won't be physically on stage. The TV show mentioned in this article that their new song will be on is probably one to promote this 2019 tour.
Yes I believe that’s coming here to Dallas but I want to see them live :)
ENORMOUS if true!
