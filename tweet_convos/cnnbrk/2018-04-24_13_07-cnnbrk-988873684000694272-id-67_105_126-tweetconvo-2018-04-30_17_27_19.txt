@realDonaldTrump Mr. Trump - you used to give yourself credits for the rise of the market. What is wrong now?? Are you responsible for its fall as well??

# FAKE 45
Looks like @POTUS44 good work has finally tailed off, and its hard times ahead for the working class, but at least the banks made huge profits.  Turkeys voting for Christmas was never going to end well

(FOR HIS FAMILY ) 
Hey thought Trump said the economy would be great. Isn’t looking too great in my eyes. But maybe he only meant great for corporations and the very rich!!  Don’t see it trickling down to the middle class anytime to soon!!
The trickle down theory has been proven to not work, more than once...
It will be back tomorrow, don’t fret.
HA!!! good one 
GREAT JOKE
After having record points on rearmings IN YEARS!!!!! How do YOU like it ...CNN??

Fake News

@realDonaldTrump Thanks for doing so much for our economy! 
Oh Trumpsters
Who's @POTUS going to blame for this? #Obama
OBama since a judge gave Dump 90 days to get DACA straightened out. See? OBama's fault.
Thanks Yrump

This losing streak is all under trump.Typical trump,he only tweets when market goes up.Hes really starting to fall Obamas totals at te same time.
Hey @realDonaldTrump I heard the funniest joke today !!       What is dumber than a liberal ?!????             Nothing !!!!!!!  when I heard that I fell out of my chair laughing crying. 
CNN loves when bad things happen for our country. Sick CNN
It's up and down too many times. It's not normal. Because he is abnormal.
Thank you Mr President,
Notice cnn doesn't want you to know this:
And in other news cnn HIDES from you:
They blaming the Democrats.  If republicans were smart. They would have taken credit for the huge climb under Obama. Before you hate , do research.

And she is still crying about losing. Now we know why.
Trump responded that was going to tweet about the strong stock market today, but there's no way he's taking blame instead of credit....

It's up and down! What's wrong  with your thinking. It's like a yo-yo.

tRump is still winning.  NOT
It's still going down !!
Thank you @realDonaldTrump for all the winning - clearly you’re clueless
That why Dow is on it longest loosing streak.
Must be from Obama’s presidency. Isn’t that what the Democrats are saying
