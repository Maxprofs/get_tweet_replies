DNA website led to his identification. Ancestry, Vitagene, MyHeritage and 23andMe already denied any connection to his case.
They ALL participate in the govt #BigBrother database despite their denials. Everyone who has ever taken one of these tests, you & your families are now part of the largest DNA databases ever.
I think if true this case is gonna bring a wave of laws restricting law enforcement agencies from accessing those private databases.
Surprise surprise he was a cop too, just goes to prove what I tweeted earlier about cops this bastard just took it to the highest extreme. Is it possible that none of his fellow officers knew nothing of his activities? Difficult to believe.
He was a cop... for like a year.... 27 years ago.... and he was fired.. jesus christ you people.
That shows you the incompetence in law enforcement and the fbi  40 god dam years and you finally found him
I would make a comment, but I don't have all my faculties and I haven't seen all floors yet according to Acosta, hehehe.
Lived a full life, worked as a cop, I shudder to think of how many people are dead or behind bars from "this very fine person"

Be a miracle if he pleads guilty! Maybe Cosby's lawyer should help him.
There are more women coming out and talking about Bill Cosby than a man that was deemed the Golden State Killer.
More people are familiar with Cosby. The Killer story is newer to most although I have been following it since 1980. Both men are terrible excuses for human beings in their own special way.
How many other law enforcement officers are out there w similar backgrounds who haven't been caught? Why don't people realize that when they do home DNA tests thru Amazon etc., that all their info gets reported to the govt to be placed into a huge database forever? #BigBrother
Wow! Watched a recent documentary on the case-takes evil to another level. Weldone to law enforcement!
Dear Sacramento District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert (@SchubertForDA),

You have blocked me, but we'd like your comments on the fact that you've now taken funds from 17 different law enforcement sources as you investigate those same people

How's that not a conflict of interest?
And an ex police officer

The way our justice system is set up in America, he just may get probation and bond.
Suspected Serial Killers hopefully all get MRIs too. So we can spot a killer before he gets to kill. If we all got baseline MRI's young, before a certain age, maybe we would spot a pattern that could be treated, saving innocent lives and preventing the potential killer from ruin.
That’s right @TheLeadCNN @CNN Make this guy famous. Make sure everyone knows who he is. Good thing we know this guys life story now.... Next time some psycho is willing to take people out for fame, you can pat yourselves on the back for facilitating it.
Typical republican
