I wonder if he's up for cremation man I have a sick mind
He would probably actually dig that.
RIP Larry. Youâ€™ve made so many people happy! 
ANOTHER SAD LOSS!!!

Terrible loss. Covering the President's speech in  Michigan? the 3rd string is in while the other whores, I mean fake news people, are getting drunk.
He created a place for people to leave behind the responsibilities of regular life and just have fun. That's a blessing few people have given humanity. 

It sucks he died but he left us a nice thing which other people will hopefully copy.
Rip
