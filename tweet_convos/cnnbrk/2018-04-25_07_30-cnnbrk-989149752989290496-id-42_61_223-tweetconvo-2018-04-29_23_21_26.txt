Why is trump such a dotard?  He has no class whatsoever.  He's not my president, but I still felt embarrassed as a US citizen. Just sayin. 
He is SMOKIN

What a great job

To smart for some

Trump is lopping onto the only person who will be his friend, only this is Macron's pretense.  Like Trump, everyone wants something.
THIS WILL HAPPEN.  TRUMP WILL APPEAR AMENDABLE TO MACRON’S IDEA. TRUMP WILL CALL PILLOW MAN AND REST OF FRIENDS, THURSDAY TRUMP APPEARS!! U.S. WILL BE ALIENATED FROM BRITAIN AND EUROPE! IRAN WILL START ITS URANIUM MINING AGAIN! GENIUS DEAL MAKER STRIKES AGAIN!!!
Dishonest Donny finally found one thing he can do right,brush off dandruff. He’s such s putz!!!!
Would be a great men's room attendant.
Macron looks at him like he got stuck with the school buffoon as a partner for a class project
It's the negative attitude of the left that will make the right win
Please
There is no middle.
Will the professional dandruff remover be on hand?
Under his mommy guidance
He contradicted Trumps views. Be better president for us then orange guy
If only arrogance could be brushed off so easily.
So much for the #specialrelationship between the US and UK. Trump loves us Brits so much, he sleeps in a French bed. Better to be a Redcoat than a turncoat. #TurncoatTraitor
The liberal hate is assurance that they are growing more and more concerned about 2020.  Your 2020 candidate won’t be able to hate Trump like you want and if he does, he will alienate moderates and  undecided voters..
With his atrocious social skills, how was @realDonaldTrump EVER let out of the house as a child?!?
Very bold and excellent speech from Macron who has given a clear and realistic vision of the world. Though the last 2 days' kisses with Trump suddenly become "fake kisses" !
Trump is just s monkey in the jungle grooming a superior.
I really hope Marcon lays it all out on the table:

How we have became the laughingstock of the free world, and begs our “leader” to either smarten up, or step down.
What is he doing!? Is Trump poking Macron?

Opps drops of yellow pee, let me take care of that... ;-) I think our fake president is So In Love that fake first lady is happy for once? No! #FakePOTUS

get the creepy little hands of him
I will follow updates but not on CNN. Fake News.
Daily show: "Bromance"
It will be good for the Congress (and many of the American people) to get in touch with how the Europeans address international issues. I expect Macron won't soften his political tongue for the occasion.
This is classic primate behaviour, as Trump grooms his prize and displays him for the multitude, just like Harambe. How do we save Macron?
Wouldn't it be cool if he addresses Congress and says, "you have got to impeach this dotard"?

So Trump convinced him to address the congress while he kept on refusing
