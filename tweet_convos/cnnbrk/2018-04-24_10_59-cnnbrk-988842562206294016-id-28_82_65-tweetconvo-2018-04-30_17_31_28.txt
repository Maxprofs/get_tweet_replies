If the presidential elections #Election2016 were held today, would you vote for Donald Trump or Hilary Clinton?  #polls
Neither...the true candidates were ousted by greed - Sanders and Kasich - see what happened,?
For the people - not the greed
Santorum back on @cnn.  I switched to @msnbc right away
lol, this was your original clueless tweet:

Dow up 100 points on great earnings
Dow climbs 100 points on strong corporate profits. Caterpillar and Harley-Davidson jump on upbeat earnings. Nasdaq up 0.4%. Watch live https://cnnmon.ie/2K6Lanz  
Wait until Trator Trump does even more to weaken the future of the USA, as Putin hired him to do. Impeach Traitor Trump now.
CNN has officially become a tabloid magazine .

But but but, Frump say the economy is roaring
Just letting some steam off. You drongos don’t get the SM. Ups and downs is nothing. Greed wins, ask Michael Douglas.
How come Donald always takes credit for market moves upward but is never heard from when it goes down.#TheBuckStopsAnywhereButMe
How come Democrats say it’s obama when it goes up but not Obama when it goes down?
What is this in $
@realdonaldtrump comes through again!  yet another thing trump has is driving into bankruptcy; the USA.
We're trillions in debt, we passed bankruptcy a few decades ago.
#Trump
Lol, excuse my cliché, but I cant resist, “FAKE NEWS” 
@realDonaldTrump  This looks like fake news!  It must be if it’s from CNN. Even the Trumpsters will have a problem calling this fake. Can’t wait until the deficits start eating 25-30% of tax revenue to just make the debt payments . But then it will be someone else’s problem.
I can't wait til technology and automation reach the tipping point and decimate the tax base altogether. That's going to be an amusing day of blood and carnage in the streets.
The truth is showing slightly...ever so...
Cnn never tweets when dow is up!!
For once it wasn't because of something stupid SOMEONE said.
@realDonaldTrump companies doing great, huh?
The false bubble has burst??
Great job b @realDonaldTrump  - this is winning
wait when is up bigly you snowflakes were saying the president has nothing to donwith stock market?
They say it’s still on Obama’s watch. Lol
You can't wait to report that. Try reporting all the good Donald Trump has done!
He did this too!
Don't be surprised if it drops another 1,000 this week. 10 yr almost at 3% which will crush the equity market.
Its a buying op, you dunder head, and it’s still a plus since the Don became, President.
Hate my life
