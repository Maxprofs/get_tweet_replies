@RandPaul You have the weakest moral compass of anyone in http://Congress.How  much Russian $ have you taken?
Rand you are a Queen with a bad case of the vapors.
TRUMP WINS
Hey @CNN #free the blacks from there democrat slave masters
Why announce that you won't vote for someone, then change your mind?  Rand Paul spoke to Trump several times and changed his vote.  Wonder what or how much Trump offered him for his vote?  Rep's are spineless cowards.
And a bunch of Democrats. Even democrats turning on Democrats.  The democrat party sucks so bad for those who say port it.  Embarrassing
Nooooo ... Human divots ever again. 
TRUMP is winning!
1st in class West Point, 1st in class Harvard Law, unblemished record in congress. Voting against is just cheap politics. Democrats feel no shame.
True To Form Republican WH 45 Corrupted White Old Males @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr Liars Has No Use Of Truth Corruption Has No Use Of Integrity Republicans Legacy@SenateGOP @SpeakerRyan

Rand Paul making a scene and then voting right in line with Trump - who could have seen that coming?!
HUGE step up from Clinton!
That's what the Russians said! Lol! They were scared of her, unlike their 
"Puppet-in-Chief "!

Yay , great nominatee
#randpaulthesellout #pissonyourownintegrity @RandPaul #yoursonisadisappointment @RonPaul
Awesome
To bad right CNN .......losers
Pompeo will b on Rand Paul's head, he's "cried wolf" one time to many with his BS, this vote and what happenings because of it will b on him.
Wonder what Rand Paul was guaranteed by Trump to flip?
I'm sure it was substantial. 
The swamp is alive and well!!
Only it's also become a cesspool.
Rand Paul did what any sane person would do - choose the most qualified person for the job - end of story.
He did not flip his vote .It had been his intention all the time to put Dems at ease. !
Fine!!!
Apparently, Rand Paul likes the way Trump tastes.
@RandPaul @GOP @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump #TheResistance
@WhiteHouse
To the average person a good government is one they don't hear about all the time in the main stream news
WELL YOU STUPID IDIOTS @CNN THOUGHT YOU COULD STOP IT LMAO!! #FAKENEWSCNN CNN  IS THE CANCER OF NEWS NETWORKS
Getting ready watch that mouth, getting ready to suck some!!
New Jersey Senators Menendez  and Booker are really a disgrace voting against Pompeo’s confirmation.... they  should be made to pick up debris of the NJ Tpk north and south ramps until clean.....!

The biggest fraud in US politics is @RandPaul . The man claims strong beliefs but will in the end do anything his party wants  most kindergartners have  more guts than he does
Stop nominated perverse @CIA for @StateDept @realDonaldTrump @RexTillersom

Yuck!
WRONG PERSON FOR JOB.  SAD FOR AMERICAN WHO ARE NOT RIGHT RACE, RELIGION OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION ASBWELL AS WOMEB.
. Shame on you Rand Paul!

The Age of Trump.  No R is safe.
Trump WIN.
Best post of the day!
Anyone ever notice that Rand plays this dramatic game all the time. I'M AGAINST IT!!!!! then he votes for it in the end?
Pompeo lies about serving in the GulfWar to make himself look like one of our hero veterans. He is a liar. #StolenValor
Paul does it every time mind is like the wind changing in a flash
He has tiny tiny cajones and will do whatever his party wants every time
No he didn’t. Trump used bullying and blackmail to get Pompous Pompeo out. This recommendation is a sham.
Rand Paul flipping....that is the least surprising thing that I have heard all day.
It's totally not like Rand Paul to talk tough & grab some TV time, only to flip at the last minute to do exactly what Trump wanted him to do anyway...
They got dirt on Rand now?
I KNEW Rand would flip. Sissy.
