I’m glad he was caught but I will never pay for one of those DNA ancestry services. They should be free if they’re going to be giving up the most private of private “data” an individual possesses.Hell they can even use it to manufacture clones without your knowledge in the future
Pare A Noya iz a Terribow Ting. Hide. Be afwaid.
oh so now he can't walk? Probably doesn't 'remember' anything either
Glad he was caught, now I'm conflicted about doing an ancestry dna.
With my humble opinion... CNN.,
All these killings happening in Nigeria, Why are you guys not publishing it? Kids, women, the elderly are being killed daily in the middle part of Nigeria...are they not worthy of your coverage?
Death racism?
Is this @realDonaldTrump without the Pomeranian?
He’s probably 5 minutes from death. Why would he?!
Doesn't he look like the Jay from modern family?
Hope His Brain is slated for an autopsy just as soon as.
Finally justice will be served.
Ex cop eh?
He seems to be living in a different world
He has no idea where he is
THUG
Yo, dude! Why aren’t you reporting the breaking news of the day. Korea? Russia? No collusion?
Very appreciative of advances in forensic science!
