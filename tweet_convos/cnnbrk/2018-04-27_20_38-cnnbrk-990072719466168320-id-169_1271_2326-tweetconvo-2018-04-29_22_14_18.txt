What we may think as child sacrifice could be a children cemetery or an area that is reserved for only children to be buried.
They probably concluded based on forensic evidence that the deaths were all at the same time, with the same wounds and other characteristics as they explained

fun tweet.
Kind of like today’s Planned Parenthood!
I was unaware that PP crack open the sternums of children between the ages of 5-14 and rip their beating hearts out of their chests for sacrifice.
Might as well!
What devilry?!

And to think, the Christian missionaries ruined this pristine land by admonishing the natives not to sacrifice their children.
I guess killing them and taking their land was the next best thing.
The largest child sacrifice in history and it's still happening all around the world is called abortion
This is interesting. But in the end, 'largest' or 'smallest' doesn't really matter. Probably every culture on earth has a history of human sacrifice and cannibalism.
Yep. Aztecs, celts, egipthyans, early romans, minoics, greeks, jews and christians btw
Yes, I remember attending a seminar on ancient Minoan archaeology and the scholar talked about the knife marks on the bones of children.
It was actually @KevinSpacey summer residence.

NO LARGEST CHILD SACRAFICE IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW...5000 BABIES A WEEK TO ABORTION. . 39 % OF THOSE BABIES BLACK. HALF BY PLANNED PARENTHOOD. IF YOU VOTE DEMOCRATIC YOU VOTE FOR DEATH AND GENOCIDE OF AFRICAN AMERCIANS.#BLACK LIVES

This happened only 550 years ago? Wtf?
Right? It’s so easy to forget how fast we’ve really advanced.
maybe thanos was looking for a soul stone in the wrong place
Meanwhile Peruvians....

Thanks religion.
Its weird to see people’s comments on this as though they only read a handful of words in the the tweet, let alone the actual story.

Will do
Interesting history lesson, but this is not breaking news.
....the  s work??
To think we were ever dumb enough to think killing people would stop it from raining...

Then again you've got a bunch of crazy people saying gays cause hurricanes. 

I guess that's a step forward? 
4000 American babies lost daily due to abortion.
like a #horror movie
@insta_christian how many eclipses happened that year!? Huicholopotli must have been pissed
Blood sacrifice to Moloch
Thanks be to God for the European Christian explorers who put a stop to child and infant sacrifice.
Yeah?, they sacrificed everyone in their crusade in the name of christianity
Don't lie. People freely chose Christianity....not hard to see why.
“Freely” translation- become a Christian, or we’ll commit genocide on you.

You know what, we’ll still commit genocide :)))
Actually....they became Christian to avoid genocide.  Same applies today.  Pagans specialise in genocide.
I’m confused. When you said they converted to Christianity to avoid genocide, who was committing genocide?
They were committing genocide on each other, strong against the weak, adults against children. Familiar eh!
I think you don’t understand what genocide means. It’s the deliberate killing of a specific group of people.
Wait, that can't be.  Aboriginal Americans were peaceful loving people who wouldn't hurt anyone.
So there’s this place called Peru...
So there's this place called the Americas...
There’s this place called Europe, where descendants pillaged and raped the locals of “America” then committed genocide
Yet this massacre happened before Europeans arrived.
The wonders of religion.
The wonders of paganism and heartless atheism.
Never heard of an atheist sacrificing someone. Or burning witches. Guess it's hard to do something like that when when you really have no reason to.
They sacrifice their babies everyday.  Creepy.

@dtrentss
Our society aborts the unborn, so are we really any better in this regard?
Evidence of ancient Planned Parenthood activity.
Those poor llamas.
Fucking really?? I’m pretty sure we’ve killed waaay.   And I mean wasaaaaaay more than 140 children in one sitting.

Only difference is, we didn’t leave enough parts of said children to ever be discovered.

Check your facts.
This was 550 year ago. Very sad. But have a look to #SOSNicargua and spread the news. In just 1 day 60+ students killed and hidden in government hospitals more killed students. This is happen today as if time is coming back.

@Zak_Bagans investigate
What about the 2000 children who are murdered due to abortions daily in the US alone?
I'm thinking WW1,WW2, Korea and Vietnam might have that beat as largest child sacrifice in history.
The largest child sacrifice in history is called abortion.
When someone asks a missionary “why are you trying to change them? they have their own religion!”
If the so called 'superbeing' ask for big sacrifices from petty, little people then there's something wrong with the whole 'theory'. 
Can you imagine the eve of the day where these souls were 'sacrificed'? I'm sure Peru was haunted by deep agonizing silence on that eve...

Molech and Baal were some heinous pagan gods. aka Satan. I’ll be sure to check out your link.
This was all about their sun god. The all powerful in their minds.
Paganism is a death cult....which attacks the weak.
So is Christianity.
Christianity is a life giving truth. Christ said, I come to give you life.  Thank Jesus.  Hell awaits the death cultists
Armageddon ring a bell? Also, Matthew 10:34: Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.
Of course you fight death cults. The church doesn’t like competition. Also, no deity has ever been real, including yours. And remind me, again, how many kids have catholic priests raped? Is that why you fight for kids?
We fight evil mister.  Worth remembering those who kill their own children don't have a future. Good riddance is what I say!
Im wstching the bionic women, and the agent in charge said i need someone i can send in alone &. Is selfreliant. I related it to myself.
Anyone else notice that its the Trump supporters who always have the stupidest, most ill informed comments on everything? Dullards.
MAYBE IS ONLY A BURIAL GROUND FOR CHILDREN ...THEY DIE B/C THE YOUNG ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE IN ANY CIVILIZATION...LOOK AT US ABORTIONS KILL MILLIONS,,AND STILL KILLING...BEFORE THEY BORN,,,
Gee what was happening in the Americas 500 years ago?
Oh, yes...
Colonization!
The stupidity in some of these replies is mind blowing.
Evoking despondent memories
Jesus H Christ... SAVAGES !!
Lol plenty of child killing by Muslim savages
Stupid religion.
Honey have you seen the kids today?
666 was long been on earth
What
Happy Saturday to you too!

An early DACA deal?
No. The largest child sacrifice is in the U.S. Abortion has killed MILLIONS of children.

They probably did not believe in a God that created us in his image and that we have an immortal soul. Humans were just meat to sacrifice to a sun god?

Human sacrifice to appease the gods has a long and far-flung history. However horrendous to us the spilling of blood has often taken on sacred dimension in ancient religions. We find that temple practice with animals in the Hebrew Scriptures. And of course the Christian story.

Humanity at another low point 
How?
Religious beliefs astound me nothing natural about murder
In those days death by sacrifice was the most glorious death you could have besides death in battle
i know you're right but as i've gotten older i view things in a different perspective
Tell me you haven't met a child (or 140) you didn't want to sacrifice...
Now a days children are being killed. Why not we care for them?

Who’s this fruit?
It's actually Wolf Blitzer reporting on Russian collusion starting 550 years ago.

@DanielaRosell 
I think there might have been a larger one on Pedoland Island, but they blew it up so we may never know, or will we? More than likely, the remains would have been weighted down and dumped in the deepest spot closest to the Island. why waste time and fuel, no one will ever look?
Why are they digging up bones of historical sacrifices why don't them archeologist go dig there grand parents bones for once. Shit let them be haven't you-all not done enof shit.
you wiil give up much more
“May be”? God damn, I hope they’re not expecting to find remains from a larger one than this!
