I want to pile plates on the small of his back, and peel his skin off. That piece of shit ruined my childhood. In fact, my whole neighborhood. He doesn't deserve anything less. A peaceful death isn't something that kind of evil deserves. Thank you, the people lived through
I always got a creepy feeling from Balki Bartokomous

Wow, looks like the guy who threatened Stormy
Looks nothing like chump
Your reporter Jim Acosta is ruining CNN. Can’t wait til they throw out your channel at the airports. You are a disgrace and he needs to be fired. PERIOD!! He shows absolutely no respect for Sarah Sanders but so happy she gets the upper hand.
Read another website said suspect was a former police officer.
Horror themselves, for finding him. Death, isn't even good enough for him. Agony isn't even enough. Insects eating him alive isn't enough. He deserves nothing less than the most heinous punishment mankind can devise.

Is this the same guy that threatened the next Democrat Presidential candidate, Stormy Daniels?
Oh wow
Looks like the guy who threatened stormy daniels
Yeah because that really happened.
No way. How have they collared him after 40 years? This never happens.
Same guy who was thought to be 2 separate killers. Never mind Ramirez, this guy was the ORIGINAL night stalker. Fair play for them never giving up on the case.
Finally they caught him!
And he was a cop 
Looks like Stormy’s composite of guy who threatened her life.
I thought it was this guy,.... triptards were looking for!!!
Shit show-[FNN]...lol

@PatriotsSoapbox run the show 24/7 live now!
I think he is the one that threatened sex star. And CNN contributor Stormy Daniels who personally sources say. Serviced JIM Acosta
I wonder how many law enforcement officers can be linked to thousands of other unsolved crimes?
Finally!
Sad that she didn't live to see this but well done!  I hope that this will bring some level of justice for the victims.....
Let us hope it is him

Take that Liebert kkkrap somewhere else, trollbot.
Was taken into custody and didn't get shot. Wow a serial killer
Maybe he didn’t Point a gun (or anything resembling a gun)at the cops.  The cops can’t win!  They get a creep off the streets and still get bashed!
Yeah but he didn't get twenty rounds put in him cause he had a cell phone some
Well finally something that is not fake. But I will wait and see how they spin it on the T.V.
And yet another cop who is above the law and gets away with it till he is 70.  Great system.
So called seriously ....Smh DNA don't lie
Ask Stormy Daniels.
Looks like @WayneGretzky 
Bout time I saw it on CNN... Twitter news had it hours ago.
You call yourself News! POS more like it. Obama, HRC,Sharpton, Holder, DNC, Crooks& Belong in Jail.

Freaking last.  Justice
We watched a special on him.
That man is probably with one foot in the grave and the other on a Banana peel because of age now.#MyRealTalk but I guess,late justice is better than no justice.
id channel  has been showing a 3part documentary of this for the past 2hours now they found him unhuh
Let me guess . This too is @Scaramucci .
Owen Wilson???
WHAAAAAAT???????
@talia_lol
Why leave his name out of the story CNN?  Joseph Deangelo.
It isn't officially confirmed yet. More than likely is DeAngelo, though.
Holy s***. I hope this is true.
Looks like a sketch of an 80's teen pop singer. Like, Andy Gibb or someone...
ok who is going to be the first one to put an old picture of #tombrady up on this photo also.  lol
I’m so excited they caught him wonder who he is we all  called have met him and didn’t know that was him!!!

I hope it is so he could get the death penalty..wretched human being
Kinda looks like this guy, did he threaten Stormy Daniels?

Nutssssss
That looks like Stormy Daniels sketch of her ex-husband/attacker person.   Did you use the same drawing for both issues?

Sweet baby Jesus.
@QueenCandace94
That’s weird, I’m at this moment watching a show about the attacks on ID, a cold case investigator is going over ithe cases, maybe that’s how they caught him.
The episode that comes on at 2:00pm will give us both the answers on that 
Was Joe DeAngelo the #VisaliaRansacker as well as #GoldenStateKiller #EastAreaRapist? Did he murder #ClaudeSnelling #DonnaJoRichmond #JenniferArmour? https://soundcloud.com/12-26-75/  https://www.facebook.com/December261975/  #DNADay
Still can't get over it, holy hell. #earons
Resembles Stormy Daniels ex-husbandboyfriendwhatever....

Holy shit
@steph_devlin_ this is crazy
Now THIS is news!!

It was #LukeSkywalker all along!
*he’s currently a member of a National Hockey League team.
Make him eat his own balls
@MyFavMurder @KarenKilgariff @GHardstark
Golden State killer under arrest?
They've been on it since last night.
Oh I haven't seen anything until just now 
Good thing their better at catching killers as opposed to fixing an ELECTION.  #CORRUPT
Pointless photo then.. He's an older man now....
*sketch*
His drawing makes him look too young to have been raping and murdering for decades...years maybe.
The drawing is from decades ago. He's believed to be in his 60s-70s now.
?????????
That looks like Stormy Daniels accuser
She has an accuser?
QUICK, HAS ANYONE SEEN @tedcruz
He looks like the guy that threatened Stormy Daniels
The guy appears to be an Ex-Cop.
Has trump congratulated him yet
So woe to the worshippers  #qoran
Holy! Holy! Holy!

Oh hai Mark
Wow this is huge! Ive watched many 48 hours, 20/20, Dateline on this guy! Glad he is in custody!
Finally!
congrats to @mobute etc etc
