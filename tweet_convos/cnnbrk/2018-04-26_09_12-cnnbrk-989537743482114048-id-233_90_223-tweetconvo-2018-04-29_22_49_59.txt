We don't want Numpty visiting us...ever! He's a public embarrassment to your country. Why on earth did you ever elect him?
He's gonna be so disappointed when they don't break out the golden horse drawn coach for him.
...or the golden shower cubicle.
Although rumor has it London has a rather interesting kink underground.
What kind of train are they running in that Underground? 
The S&M express.
I thought they told him NOT to come..
Demons of the earth 
My condolences to the British people. They could always go on holiday during his visit. Oh yes another advice. Keep your wife's and daughters ( just to be sure your sons as well) in doors.
Heâ€™s very welcome
