His mumble rapping ass should’ve stayed there
He must have mentioned he wanted free black coffee from Starbucks.
Breaking news!
The courts are investigating EVERY case by his arresting officer who has been investigated for falsifying evidence, lying under oath, and insisting witnesses all to secure convictions against Black defendants.  ... don't bring up his so called crime!
#justice
Intimidating witnesses. Autocorrect is a B
So, another entitled black man gets released.
@cnnbrk
At long last. To God b de Glory
I'm pretty sure God doesn't want any glory from this unimportant issue.
I've said it before and I'll say it again - FINALLY we can get back to songs about girls lickin his n*ts! So glad he's free, his music is PURE ART.

Not long enough.
This is definitely not breaking news. You should only tweet things from this account if this truly breaking news and this does not qualify as breaking news.
Hater
Meek Mill aka #drakeslittlebitch
he is not a good rapper he only shouts the words out
How long before another gun crime?
He should still be in jail, it's insane that he is allowed to violate his probation and get away with it because he's famous
Aaaaaaand they were just going to release Reinking on $2 mil bond? What the ever loving f^<k???...........
Exactly!
He'll be right back on another probation violation
He'll be right back....on another parobation violation
@donlemon you helped brought his story out there as well. You are the real MVP.

Rich privilege.
Wow too much happening in philly this year @Eagles, @sixers, this guy , d election . It’s lit lit   
Bullshit

Can’t keep sexy man like that locked up
Sexy girrrl please! No he isn't you must be looking at his wallet! Now that's sexy lololol
The cop lied, the judge hates me, its not my fault, I didn't understand the plea agreement, I didn't have a gun, they weren't my drugs, I didn't know riding an ATV on a city street was a crime, the system is racist. Any and all excuses to:
#FreeMeek 
#MeekFree
Exactly! Lololol
He’ll be back in prison before the end of the year. They always do.
Long overdew
Now get out and go home and stop doing DUMB JUNK!!
@MeekMill welcome home 
come back home #mayibuye africa
Am I supposed to feel sorry for a guy that committed gun crimes and  then violated his probation?  I thought guns were the worst thing going in our society?
What a joke.  So I guess if your black , and famous you get away with breaking the law and not paying for it.
John Hinckley shot Regan... your point?
What's that have to do with the price of bananas?
I am sure he is a pillar of Philadelphia society.  Was he locked up for his "music"?   It's rap - he should be!
Who?
 I know who is he?
CNN has given more time for this story about a career criminal over the story of how North Korea will disarm its nuclear weapons.
Just like iran huh lol
Dawn of justice

You can get bailed out of prison?
#MeekMill is innocent.
police problem
Free slave!!!@DreamChasers! Never stop!!
Slave to breaking the law? I miss something?
You didn't miss anything. Laws mean nothing to liberals lol.
Unfair Judge railed @MeekMill @TacopinaLaw getting it done!
hey @meekmill, next time a judge warns you 4 times to stop violating probation, dont violate a 5th time.
Doesn’t effect you either way
Foi a prisão para escrever um disco.... brevemente lança mais um cd
Let’s see how long he can stay out of trouble.
Why
Get this man in the booth immediately.
With his ghost writers! Yes we can't wait to hear what they will write for him...
Thank God. How were we all living without Meek Mill.
Lmboooo exactly I love this! Who gives a damn he didnt do anything positive in those 5 months to maje us happy he is out! Smh
What happened to your, “He’s been set free!” tweet?
Damn privileged whi... oh wait... btw how many parole violations can you make anyway? wtf?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meek_Mill#Legal_issues …
Well it’s about time, ya racist fucks.
Many thanks to @donlemon of CNN for bringing Meeks issue to public light. Journalism at its best. Thanks Don!
He belongs locked up
Not really- after reading his Wiki page (with a grain of salt), he belongs locked up.. the dude sounds like a piece of shit..

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meek_Mill 
He was supposed to do 2-4 yrs, he probably ratted somebody out smh
He ratted me out. Now I'm going to jail 
Oluwa o!!!!

America has some nerve criticizing other countries' human rights record while treating African-Americans like garbage!
But he is garbage..
Laugh Out Loud
I think his sentence was harsh...but so much for the justice system I guess huh? Because he’s famous and got a bunch of celebrities to bring publicity, he gets out? I guarantee you there are thousands of non famous people sitting in prison for less
Then again Waffle House murderer was granted bail....
Happy to hear dat.. Nikki shd visit him

Living in Philadelphia and being in prison is basically the same thing.  #Shithole
Amen!!!
Sixers winning it all confirmed
But I just got a tattoo that says "free Meek Mill.  People will think I have Meek Mills to spare.
Thanks to the Lord
Yuh

If the presidential elections #Election2016 were held today, would you vote for Donald Trump or Hilary Clinton?  #polls
