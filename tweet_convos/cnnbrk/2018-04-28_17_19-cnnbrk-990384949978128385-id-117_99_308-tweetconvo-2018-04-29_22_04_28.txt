His hands really are small

What's North Korea got to do with Michigan's economy ?
Gotta fire up the crowd since he can't fire up a cross. It's a 21st century Klan rally that our hard earned money pays for.

I see you found the copy/paste function. Good for you!
Go away bot
Why is he having a rally? Was the golf course closed?
Please pardon the crass comment, but I refer to it as his “RallyBoner.” He needs it to feel good about himself.

Didn't he say something similar three or four weeks ago?
...after South Korea does all the heavy lifting, this schmuck will swoop in and claim victory.
Wellllllllll many people including the leader of South Korea praised trump for being contributor to all this happening.
Those little hands though!! 
#likesMixedNuts
What would we be trading "honorable" (DT's word) Kim Jong-un
to de-nuclearize ??

Do you think Kim Jung-un is going to give up Tyranny ??

There are MISSING NEGOTIATIONS to the North Korea THEATRICS.

Putin&DT's STAGED Circus ... I Call B.S.
Only president in history to hold rallies after winning.
Maybe the North Koreans will keep him

Foreign (previously hostile) nation taking US president hostage. Great way to start WW3 or nuclear war. So... sure, let's pray for that shall we...
The Nation is already held hostage by Trump and his phony Administration.Trump,Bolton and others who are in control are the very ones just itching for a war.But since you are so sensitive, if you don't like what people say to express their feelings,shut your eyes.
If anyone deserves a Nobel Peace Prize it would be the President of South Korea 
It's so very funny how Obama got a peace prize just for becoming president, then turning the middle east in a bigger powder keg than it already was. Now there's a president who has a big mouth, yet right after the CIA director went to NK, there's hints to ending war and peace.
North Korea will NOT give up their nukes...period.
Are you the representative of North Korea? Or maybe do you have a crystal ball?
It got them a meeting with Trump...why would they give it up...if Trump backs out of the Iran deal his word will be meaningless anyway lol
What did getting nuked give them? More isolation, even the Chinese are slowly backing away from them. It is possible that Kim is finally realizing there is more to be gotten from giving them up.
The key word here is "potential" talks. I say Trump has the "potential" to be locked up, impeached, or both in the next year.
Going off subject but I've had a couple drinks soooooo - this pic of the  with those widdle hands in that position makes me wonder - where in the hell are those monkey bars at??
Trump is kicking ass and taking names!! WINNING,WINNING,WINNING!! #SaturdayNight #TrumpInMichigan
Kicking America's ass !
Love haters!! Just because Trump is doing what Obama couldn’t do!!
Obama saved us from Bush .. who is going to save us from Trump ??
My God they're tiny!
Maybe instead of holding these “election rallies” he should stay in the fkng White House and do the job he was “elected” to do!!!
An obama failure!  Has the potential that can bring President Trump the nobel peace prize!  Bringing peace to North and South Korea!
Whoa! They really are that tiny!!! No wonder he has to drink water with both hands like a toddler.
trump it seems likes giving and getting oral, for hs fragile ego. which is why he needs his rallies, where they yell nut job nut job, (maybe it was a different word), i heard nut job. for trump supporters oral refers to communications. not the other.
Love it when @PARISDENNARD turns into a pretzel to cover @POTUS garbage actions.
The fact that POTUS Donald Trump tries to up stage his own White House Correspondence dinner (twice), with his own personal 'campaign style' rally kinda says a lot about the guy.
@KINGoftheKC I think I’ve finally found smaller hands...
I will believe it when the whole thing happens,,
He likes negotiating with terrorists!!
and that includes trump how? he's a mess. Besides trump will NEVER EVER personally talk with NK leader. He'll send his flying monkey.
Trying to negotiate asylum.
Let’s them fix this their way without intervention please
I love this picture. My toddler son stand like this behind the recliner when he was pooping.
Kim played you Trump...used your knee jerk meeting to start direct talks with Moon...US will be asked to leave SK soon....and NK will keep their nukes.

does anyone agree trump talks like a 5th grader 
Wasn't a Trump supporter BUT BUT BUT he seems to be doing some good!??
It will implode...he's a conman.
Time will tell I guess
If peace is ensured in the Korean Peninsula, credit must go to President Trump too! Aggressive in gestures but silent and successful in winning peace!
@realDonaldTrump hurry up, otherwise they have peace bevor you even get there. for what will you take credit for then?

Nobel peace prize!!!
He just spouts shit with no clue what he’s saying.
I don’t think any of those behind @POTUS at the rally have a clue about NK-SK meeting he’s touting. #Clueless #MAGA

Why would anyone want to talk r see Trump after calling people out of their names and degrading their family members.
And what would Obama or Hillary be doing? They'd be sitting on their ass prob giving him $ 2 make more weapons.
Did Jinping set them, already?
I'm sure is not only trump's pressure, jinping's is also important.
trump's narcissism, campaigning, when he will start governing and uniting the DSA ?
我尊重美国人民对王牌的选择，他可能也确实为了美国人民做着实事，但是我真的认为他说话的口气好像脑袋有些进水了。
I really don’t get why he is taking responsibility for all of this.
Just hope that this dude does not call him rocket man during the meeting. For all you know he will try to show his might and be all narcissistic and screw things up
BULLSHIT

Wholly orange
Can't wait to see this, "the hand shake" I actually think Kim Jong Un hand is bigger than Trump's hand, can't wait for the handshake
God.  He really DOES have small hands.

yep...he has little hands
Hopefully Mueller will have some good news before then!
Parts of Michigan like West Virginia is Polluted and Infected by Trump.
They're posting the "trumps holds off vicious attack from 2 invisible dicks" picture again.
hasnt he been saying that for past 4-5 weeks or does it just seem like its been that long with him in Our White House?
So what?  You should be covering Kim Jong Un’s amazing speech.  They don’t need T to take credit for this important moment.  The world doesn’t spin around America, in case you haven’t noticed
Why does he have to keep doing these Klan rallies? Better yet why am I paying for them? Between this and golf I'm tired of my hard earned money funding this morons antics.
I might fly to the moon, maybe. Probably but mostly maybe

That Michigan crowd of 45 supporters, were really racist and ignorant.  Booing Hispanic people, chanting Nobel prize for that moron. Smh.
SPECIAL BUILT PIECE O' TRASH !
Yes it could happen but maybe it won't happen. We'll have to wait and see what happens.
DT is doing nothing to help Talks he will blow any chance to settle things down big mouth that knows nothing
I thought he said May the 1st
Just more Trump pathetic campaigning propaganda
DT is doing to help NK Lindsey Graham needs to give it up vote him out
Trump deserves a Nobel Peace Award if this gets completed! Good for him, he’s been trashed enough now let’s give him some due credit!!!

He's a fanboy
Uh huh. Stay tuned for more procrastination. Didn't he originally say he was going to meet him before May? #KimJongUn
@realDonaldTrump  Remember when Britain & France brought an end to the US Civil War? That's like saying trump ended the Korean War. Americans need to educate themselves about President Moon's goal and concerted effort to reunify Korea, well before and regardless of trump.
He then added, "whichever day Fox and Friends is a rerun."
moving pretty quickly for you, isn't it?...

Somebody tell trump that Michigan is a state in the USA and NK is not
Or, probably never. Trump isn’t going to North Korea.
I could be size 2 in 3 or 4 weeks too. 
does he even realize removing nukes from Korea means the U S military will not be allowed there..
I'm betting Kim Jong Un compromises Trump by tempting him with his harem.
@realDonaldTrump

Trump is the best Potus eveaaaaa!

No 1 win in fight 

The world thinks you are the “quintessential” #WorldsVillageidiot.

@WhiteHouse @PressSec @GOP @maddow @maggieNYT
Egomaniac understand each other, that’s why he will be successful.
Why risk ruining everything?
Not going to happen he a chicken
This better not be tax dollars - it better be his re-election fund that is paying for these flights and security.  I’m sick & tired of his rallies - @cnnbrk  don’t cover it - it’s not news - it’s a political ad - and you’ll be doing the same thing you screwed up in 2016
If North Korea was planning an attack this would an ideal move.
Or he'll be in jail
He's going to try and defect to North Korea
Donald Trump is my hero 
So you on the list for him to be anyone hero needs prayers
