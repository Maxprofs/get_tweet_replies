so, we were THAT close to our own Skirpal poisoning?
already happened more than once on US soil
Yep, most people already know about Michael Lesin.  Alex Oronov, not so much..  http://www.homelandsecuritynewswire.com/dr20170306-ukrainian-businessman-with-links-to-trump-russia-dies-in-mysterious-circumstances …
From the article..

"the report said, noting a Russian law passed "in July 2006 that permits the assassination of 'enemies of the Russian regime' who live abroad."
You do know we do the same thing?
You do know all of the major players do the same thing?
Have you EVER left your mother's basement?
Enabled by their well-placed mole (that would be Trump). If this were a spy novel, critics would say it's too unrealistic to sell.
This isn’t tonight’s episode of The Americans. It’s reality. Trump’s a criminal traitor.
Defectors? Had no idea that was still a thing! Thought that ended when the USSR collapsed
США страна испуганых идиотов. Кушайте фэйки! Зачем вам истина?
And the Media thought it was about Trump...What a Joke.
Got proof? Please come with evidence...
Go find the evidence yourself. If you have a problem trusting a news agency with its own sources, then you're no better than that gibbon in the white house.
Would like to believe you but, ya know, you’re cnn.
Actually... it is critical thinking... Just like FOX is 'spewing' propaganda, so does CNN/CBS/ABC etc... Something about pot and kettle.
yikes

"That episode and other US intelligence raised concerns that the Russians were preparing to target Russian émigrés in the US labeled by the Kremlin as traitors or enemies, law enforcement and intelligence officials said."
Why because the government run propaganda press is reporting unvalidated rubbish. Ask then to print Israeli military ordered to shoot children... US weapons sold to Saudis killing women and children.
To much detail missing, we are not being told... Israeli army ordered snipers to shoot children!!!! If the media would do their job, you would have known...
Your funny!!! That's why you like the "Comedy Narrative Network" for people who have trouble following facts...

Can anyone explain how Dr. Jackson made it through 8 years of Obama administration with no one calling him out for the behavior now being alleged?
Can't be trusted, never to be treated, never try to tamed them.
Wow - guessing 45 is so pissed that BFF Putin plans were spoiled
Vladimir Putin sure doesn't know how to let things slide.
Well, they will have to track from USSR..
Nope.  The expelled guys can be replaced with fresh faces in the USA, it wasn't a reduction in numbers only a shift change.

If the presidential elections #Election2016 were held today, would you vote for Donald Trump or Hilary Clinton?  #polls
Trump, remember Hillary took a very sizable " contrabution" for 25% of U.S. plutonium! Clinton foundation is sitting high n mighty financially wise!

Russian bot
Why did Americans expel Russian diplomats?
BS
Well at least no Ruski athletes got away with doping. Maybe smoke screens work after all Natasha!
Wait, we knew there were spies here? Why did it take so long to kick them out?
If this is true, they should have been expelled regardless of the poisoning in London.

Duh....
When a war breaks out with Russia I hope everyone from CNN are on the front lines. That is what you want though right?@cnnbrk . I pray to god there is no more wars. Smh at all you instigators. Join the military now if thats what you want.
So according to the article in atleast one instance, SVR were looking into the CIA. How amazing. I bet the CIA doesn't do that to SVR. Or Mossad to VAJA or litterally every nation to another nation's intelligence agency. It's what intelliigence agencies do.
With all the Russian bashing that’s going on, there is no way nobody that matters wouldn’t comment, if it was true.
Duh
@POTUSPress
Exclusive at #FNN means #FakeNews..
Uh oh, Putin is going to fire Trump for this one.
https://medium.com/@allanishac/trump-may-be-involved-in-1956-lemonade-stand-scandal-mueller-investigation-finds-b21e246d9fc2 … serious stuff. We got him now!
If they would've asked Trump he would've told them where they're at. Just to please Putin
Good:)POLNAD NEED THIS SAME ACTIONS>
Throw them all out. And if not, throw Trump out!
When will we finally get off our asses and bring the fight to these Russian oligarchs who are killing us, funding Islamist terrorism, and using psyops to destroy our way of life?

#1776WillCommenceAgain
“Exclusive: Some of the spies replacing the spies expelled last month from the US will continue to track Russian defectors and their families.” Fixed it for ya


"Tracking" and poisoning.
Ah, but don't worry. Trump says it was and they were tracking them for good, no great reasons.
They wanted to be sure they had their current addresses so they could get their Russian social security checks. Yeah. That's the ticket.
You can't use this BS source for a story like this!!!!! Oh, CNN, go ahead.
Okay, Boris.
#FakeNews
Of course they were. Of course. Sigh.
Wow! You Dweebs are pathetic! #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA #RUSSIA RT
"In at least one instance, suspected Russian spies were believed to be casing someone who was part of a CIA program that provided new identities to protect resettled Russians, the officials said."
THIS is worth worry about. More so than silly memes about HRC

This is the evil side of that gang that runs Russia
