@PaulPatriots12  this would of been amazing to watch
Streak on the line. They tie it in the 9th and then walk off win. This is so crazy!! You must be loving it!
Wish it was on tv
I bet you do. Don't worry, next week they'll be on TV.
Fuck I'm working
No good man. They could potentially be very important games to be watching. If they are you don't want to miss them.
And it's done
Oh no!! Spewin! I was rooting for them. I really wanted to see them break the record.
I would like to thank the @mets for giving us jay bruce for free
They got a reliever from the @LCCaptains
Aka for free
True
No wer'r going all the wwwwayyyyy
Not against the struggling Royals.
Hahaha this is my favorite tweet yet
I FUCKING LOVE THIS TEAM
Congrats Tribe ! You guys are awesome ! Keep Rollin !!
Dodgers won 2 in a row!
@bryanklek just checking the score

No way @Royals should have pitched to #lindor in 9th inning. #walk the hottest hitter
Awesome!
This streak is so meaningless. Why are you guys blind to this?
So what should we do? Ignore it? Hope for losses?  Don't be daft! We know it starts over come playoffs. Doesn't mean we cant enjoy it now.

Olha o WS nascendo hein
 CLEVELAND ROCKS!  
 CLEVELAND ROCKS!  
 CLEVELAND ROCKS!  
#Indiansrock the best team in baseball 2017
I hate this team
Y tho?

@patattack2016
You're gonna choke in the playoffs and nobody will care

The Indians. Wow
I gotta admit, they're breaking an impossible record right now and it's awesome to see
History man. Also they scary
Ik. If we do end up going to the playoffs then we might have to go up against them. That's hard to take in
Yea. If we win the wild card we gotta face them.
Division*
Either way to make the WS we gotta face them in either the ALCS or ALDS. Unless they lose in the ALDS to a Wild Card team.
ʬʬʬʬʬʬʬʬʬʬʬ
Our 82 year record is over. But you guys earned it. You guys are incredible. For that. This toast is for you.
I love this team!
