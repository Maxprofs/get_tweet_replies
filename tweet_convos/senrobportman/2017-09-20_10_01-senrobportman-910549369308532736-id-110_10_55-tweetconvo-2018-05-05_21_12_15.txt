Please vote no on graham healthcare bill
Nice of you to wish for health.  Now make it happen, or lose yours. https://tinyurl.com/yasd3ofz  Inalienable right to life?
Seriously? A healthy new year? And you won't answer anyone about health care? Fire whoever writes your tweets.
Let's hope the people you kick off health care will see another Rosh Hashana. But as long as your wallet is full, who cares!
You know what would make it better, Rob? Not taking away healthcare for Ohioans. Let's have a happy and healthy new year.
Vote NO on #GrahamCassidy! There is no guaranteed #healthcare protection for Ohioans. Protect Ohioans, don't BOW to the Republican party.
It will only be healthy if people have access to affordable healthcare. Pls vote NO on #GrahamCassidy
This is the closest you’ve come to any comment on healthcare. By “happy and healthy” do you mean that you oppose Graham-Cassidy?
Thanks, but if you truly care about health of constituents, vote no on #GrahamCassidy
Vote no on #GrahamCassidy for a truly healthy New Year. Work with Dems to improve Ocare. Ohio is counting on you.
if you truly care about health, and Americans, do the right thing and vote NO on Graham-Cassidy. Please, there are lives at stake!
Do you and Jane know that GrahamCassidy will slash Ohio's federal healthcare funding by $9 billion??? Bad for OH, bad for the US Vote NO
So about that #healthcare to ensure (insure) that... how's about that "NO" for #GrahamCassidyBill ?
Special wishes for perfect health are what is needed now.
Thank you. Do what we do please. Look out for the disabled and those with pre existing conditions Vote no
Thank you. This is a time for reflections & renewal. Please reflect on the harm of #CassidyGraham and renew the ACA to make it even better.
We can't have a healthy year if you vote away millions of ppl's healthcare! #VoteNOGrahamCassidy 

Happy Rosh Hashana yall! L'Shana Tova!
I am a small biz owner & constituent asking you to vote against any repeal of ACA. This will hurt small businesses.
@senrobportman is going to strip millions of health care. Think about that. He doesn't care about any of us.
It would be a healthier year for the 20 million+ people who could lose their insurance under Graham-Cassidy if you voted NO.
You want us to be healthy?  So you're voting no?
We want healthcare.
No on #GrahamCassidy 
I know Koch spent a lot on your daily campaign postcards, but you are SUPPOSED to represent Ohio.
Why waste your time? Portman is a GOP shill. He lacks the gonads to vote contrary to his masters' instruction. #NoPortman2022
"Also, sorry for supporting a white supremacist President, but... Whaddaya gonna do amirite?"
How about "Sorry for staying silent while the Daily Stormer is produced in my state"
His silence is his complicity
The guy in #Charlottesville who mowed over an American voted FOR Portman & didn't disavow the vote.
HIS silence IS complicity in this case
How many times has he tweeted about opioids or human trafficking?
ONE tweet?
 Where's the disavowal of the vote?
It won't be a good year if you vote to kill Americans.
Left voice mail voting yes on Graham - Cassidy bill will kill adults, children, and the elderly this bill doesn't discriminate it just kills
He uses "healthy" loosely (Still awaiting statement on healthcare legislation)
No on #GrahamCassidyBill to keep them healthy and provide care if they aren't.
Re-tweet if you agree Portman should VOTE AGAINST KILLING OBAMACARE to give huge tax cuts to wealthy.   -
Vote NO on #GrahamCasiddy and while you're at it, replace the intern that runs your social media accounts.
Show your support by not voting to repeal ObamaCare. We are ALL watching. Tweets mean nothing anymore. The orange buffoon has proven that.
If you really care about your constituents you'll vote no on #GrahamCassidyBill. PLEASE!
It'll be a healthy new year if you vote NO on G-C and start working on bi-partisan health reform as our gov. @JohnKasich has implored you
Please vote against Graham-Cassidy. Protect the citizens of #Ohio
REALLY? AS U DECIDE TO GUT OUR HEALTHCARE? TONE DEAF!
VOTE NO #GRAHAMCASSIDY
Vote no on #GrahamCassidyDeathBill
It will be a healthier New Year for all of us if you vote against the Graham-Cassidy repeal.
Please vote no on Graham Cassidy. We do not want that to pass!
My family would prefer that you protect the healthcare of your constituents, and stand up to the orange menace in the White House.
#GrahamCassidy is a disaster for Ohioans. Vote NO!!
Vote no on Graham-Cassidy. Don't inflict pain on your fellow Americans.
Everyone's New Year will be healthier if they can afford to see their doctor when needed. Vote NO on #GrahamCassidy !
Same. Now please vote no on Graham-Cassidy
The healthy part is something you have some influence over at the moment.  Please vote no on Cassidy Graham.
Please vote no on the #GrahamCassidyBill
Bipartisanship? Alex. & Murray negotiations were promising for McCain & Murkowski,"serious" @ "repairing individual insurance markets"-Slate
Healthy? Don't wish: work! SHUT DOWN THE #GRAHAMCASSIDY bill.
if you want us to stay healthy all year round, vote NO on #GrahamCassidyDeathBill
I'm glad you haven't fallen for Bannon's Nazism, but your voting down The new healthcare bill will do more than wish for Ohio's health
People won't have a healthy year without healthcare.
Thank you!
Vote NO on Graham-Cassidy!
Shana Tova! We would really like you to vote NO on #GrahamCassidyBill . I have preexsiting conditions and this bill will bankrupt me.
Nice sentiment. Please vote NO on Graham-Cassidy
And let's keep the ACA and 32 million people covered for health insurance .
Stand up for Ohio instead doing your usual falling in line and not giving a damn about Ohioans. Vote no on Graham Cassidy
Healthy is the operative word in this statement Rob! Keep us healthy- vote no on Graham-Cassidy!
Then don't vote to take away our healthcare.
Vote NO on Graham-Cassidy, just like our Governor and your constiuants want you to do.  Fix the ACA.  You can do it.
It would be healthier if you voted no on Graham-Cassidy
Then, in the spirit of the holiday -- rather than paying it lip service - join Gov Kasich in opposing Graham-Cassidy for the good of Ohioans
Cool. Will we have health care in this new year? Will it actually be affordable and cover illnesses?
Vote NO on Graham Cassidy !  We need universal HEALTHCARE!  Please do the right thing for our citizens!
Thank you. Will have a healthy year except for the nasty new heath care bill. As usual you are silent. Empty your voice mailboxes.
You better vote no on this piece of garbage healthcare bill. I think many are tired of seeing you tow the line. Have a spine.
A day of personal reflection. Plz reflect & vote No on G-C. Sen. Collins teamed up with Fl dem on bill to shore up ACA. Country over Party!
Thank You. Please stand up for the disabled and those with pre existing conditions
GOP leaders put $45b for opioids in their 1st Ocare repeal bill. Now it’s gone
Thoughts?
If you are interested in healthy, how about a no vote on the Graham-Cassidy bill?
Please don't hurt ability of Ohioans to be healthy -- vote no on Graham-Cassidy
Just vote no!!!!!!!!!!!
As a Jew I reject your tidings!
You can't stay silent on white supremacy and then think this tweet will negate your racism!
Ohioans are watching you sir! This is a travesty!  You're approval of this attempt to take away our insurance might kill me! Don't do it!
Considering you will vote to repeal healthcare you really don't mean to have a healthy year, right?
That’s great!  Please vote NO on #GrahamCassidyBill - we want bipartisan solutions and we believe in you!  #countryoverparty  
You should fire the person who tweets for you. They are doing a bad job and should feel bad about it
The best New Year's gift you could give us is to promise to block #GrahamCassidy so we could ensure EVERYONE has a healthy New Year!
Don't forget the "health" part.
It’d be a lot healthier here in the United States if you’d vote against the #GrahamCassidyBill.
A wish for a healthy new year because that's all the care you get after Rob guts the ACA. He and @GOP will take away your health insurance.
Shana Tova! please vote NO on the #GrahamCassidy  bill. Preexisting conditions are back, people with employer plans cant afford premiums.
Let's celebrate by taking away your healthcare!
Emphasis on HEALTHY. New year coincides with ACA Open Enrollment season? Only six weeks to get coverage for next year.
Left you a VM, echoing the previous comments, if you are truly about health, vote no on Graham Cassidy
That was nice my Senator. Now will you vote no on Cassidy/Graham? Fellow Ohioans are watching to ensure you do the right thing.
VP Pence falsely said Friday that 60,000 Ohioans are going without care because of the state’s Medicaid expansion.-Columbus Dispatch
Healthy as in Healthcare???
It might be hard to have a Healthy new year if no one can afford Health Care, vote no on #GrahamCassidyBill
That's lovely. Lovelier would be to not hurt millions of us by taking away our health insurance.
Cool, while you're at it how about not screwing over the people in our state by taking away our healthcare?
I urge you, @senrobportman to vote no on #GrahamCassidy... Bipartisan studies show REAL people will die due to loss of coverage. REAL PEOPLE
I guess it makes sense that you're wishing people a healthy year since you're trying to take health care away
And many many more to you.
Be a leader @senrobportman . You know full well that #GrahamCassidy is very wrong for Ohio. Show us that you aren't going to sell us out!
Thank you Senator. Speaking of health, how about rejecting Graham-Cassidy? It's terrible for Ohioans' health!
Please make it a happy and healthy new year by voting no on Graham-Cassidy

we will stay healthier if you say NO to Graham Cassidy!
