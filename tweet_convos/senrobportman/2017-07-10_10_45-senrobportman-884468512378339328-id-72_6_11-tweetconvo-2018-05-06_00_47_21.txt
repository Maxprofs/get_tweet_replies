I'm glad you oppose the ACA repeal act in the Senate! Let's move to #SinglePayer so that we all can be healthy enough to enjoy the lake!!
Trump admin trying to take away lake protections. You must defend the people and environment of ohio that u represent. Please stand for us.
Time to speak out strongly about how a handicapped person was pushed from their wheelchair. Ignoring this will damage you. It won't go away
So how far does all this go? Did @GOP agree to soften Russian party platform in exchange for DNC email release? Asking for a friend.
Protect the epa!
#VoteNo to trumpcare !!!!
You voted for Pruitt you putz. no credibility, if you care so much put your votes where your mouth is.
Buckeye Lake = 3,000 acres. Welfare of 3,000 acres is important enough to talk about. What about welfare of 3,000,000 Ohioans on #Medicaid?
Do you like that video showing disabled people dumped out of their wheelchairs at your Columbus office? You should've met with them, Rob.
Protect the health care of thousand of your constituents!
Since you voted for @EPAScottPruitt you have made your efforts, and those of anyone else concerned about this issue, far more difficult.
@JohnKasich Turning OH into a ghetto with Medicaid for all.Young working adults can't buy inexpensive private hlthcare plans

New study says Obamacare is not collapsing http://nbcnews.to/2u6ZGWK  
Vote NO on healthcare bill. It is devestating for children with disabilities, including mine. #ProtectOurCare.  https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10155506787126100&id=155498106099 …
Just for old white guys, I’m guessing.
Challenges of the lake will not be solved by eliminating all regulations. We don't want any more fires or mistakes.
Robby, quit hiding with your cronies and have a town hall.  Your constituents are demanding a town hall.  We pay your salary.
Senator since you haven't had the time to meet with Ohioans what is it about the current form of the Trump healthcare bill that you support?
Remind me why you are trying to steal our health care & kill sick Americans?
This is the future of most Americans if Republicans have their way!
Fraud.
The treatment of that disabled person in your office? I've never seen anything like flipping a person out of their wheelchair. It's terrible
Dump wants to gut the Great Lakes Restoration Act. It's time to start standing up for Ohio! #Resist letting this happen & #Resist Trumpcare!
http://www.dispatch.com/news/20170711/did-columbus-officer-dump-protester-from-wheelchair … You are a disgrace, letting your constituents be thrown around like this. JUST MEET THEM! What are you hiding? SAD!
NO TO BCRA. Work with Dems to make healthcare affordable for all. Fix ACA. No to repeal/replace!!!
Yo Rob.  Whatcha gonna do about this?
This is the dumbest and biggest crime in the history of American politics. There's not even a close second.
Hey Rob, FYI- we're being sold out to the Russians. You care to comment on that comrade?
If you like the lake: Fund Lake Erie restoration. Lower phosphate runoff. Follow Gov. Kasich's lead.  A good man.
@senrobportman Your healthcare bill portrays your true feelings on the opioid epidemic. CARA/STOP don't  address illness-Political nonsense
You own this TREASON.
@gop #TRUMPRUSSIA
The emails also show that Donald J. Trump Jr. was eager to accept what he was told was the Russian government’s help http://nyti.ms/2sMcb6R 
Please stop everything and focus on keeping and improving the AHCA.
Asking @Pontifex @DalaiLama 2pray4us as our most vulnerable r trampled on. B on the rightside of history @robportman https://twitter.com/deadpundits/status/883738907359268864 …
We need to prepare for a new president.
For the rest of your life, remember that a human in a wheelchair protesting horrible GOP health bill got thrown down outside of YOUR office
"Lawmakers who care abt #Healthcare shld know tinkering round edges won't make #BCRA any less dreadful" #VoteNoBCRA
Thank you for protecting our lakes AND for voting "NO" on the pending health care bill. Please represent your constituents with a "NO" vote!
Agreed, please keep our lake and rivers clean. You'll have to Sen. Portman b/c @EPAScottPruitt won't.
But you @senrobportman voted for Pruitt; support dt and his Russian following; and want to take away healthcare from Ohioans.

Republican senators, here's how many constituents will lose insurance coverage under your health care plan http://nyti.ms/2u8PJck  
1,122,000  Ohioans estimated to lose insurance under GOP healthcare plan. Tell us how you're fighting for the state again?
We need to prepare for future opportunities! I look forward to working with my fellow constituents in VOTING @SENROBPORTMAN OUT OF OFFICE.
I look forward to your next town hall meeting. #coward #resign
Will our Russian overlord allow future opportunities? Your willful silence on Russia's manipulation is deafening, Comrade!
Come 2018... the GOP can never again campaign that they will repeal ObamaCare. We now know that is a lie.
Is that a cop or a cosplayer? Yeesh.
#FakeAmericans
https://twitter.com/nytopinion/status/884425561497579520 …  who cares right? Pretend to fix it and vote?!
GOP senators should be concerned. The health care bill would eliminate coverage for millions of their constituents http://nyti.ms/2tGkDWn  
Greatest wealth inequality since the Great Depression. 50% of Americans living paycheck to paycheck. Please don't make it worse.
They are going to press you hard these next two weeks, but the people are clearly against this crappy and wildly unpopular bill.
Just a reminder, Senator - MILLIONS of Americans are counting on YOU to make their lives better, not worse. VOTE NO on #Wealthcare
Glad to hear of Marcy Kaptur's Lake Erie Leaders Roundtable meeting. Can you get your EPA Sec Pruitt to attend?  Or to care, or to believe?
Then you better start fighting Perry for it. Otherwise you are blowing smoke.
And Pruitt will try to destroy the lakes. Vote No on Senate health bill. Fix, don't repeal, ACA.
Lake Punderson has a State Park with plenty of room for a lovely #TownHall. The Geauga Parks also. See you soon! (I hope)
So you're having a hard time at your town halls? Is it your constituents complaining or the Democrats? Who will vote for you...
Not bad, but if Ag runoff solutions work for Grand Lake St. Marys that would really help solve Lake Erie issues
Average depth of Buckeye Lake is 2 feet, its a cesspool from years of dumping raw sewage in it
What about your guards dumping a woman out of her wheelchair and walking away?
strongly supported @ScottPruittOK for EPA, who promptly proposed defunding Great Lakes Restoration Initiative! #ConManRob

Support our President
Vote no on the healthcare bill

The President is helping attack elections & won't allow cameras in WH press briefings & you want to talk about the future?
Are you voting for the Senate GOP healthcare bill or not?
Cancer patients and their families deserve to know.
Medicaid recipients and their families deserve to know.
All Ohioans with pre-existing conditions deserve to know.
All Ohioans whose unborn children will be born with a pre-existing condition deserve to know.
All Ohioans who will lose their job and will need individual ACA plans deserve to know.
All Ohioans deserve to know. #leadership
Need too get open market healthcare going, then address opioids and welfare
You've got roughly 5 years left, so hurry up. #WeWillReplaceYou
