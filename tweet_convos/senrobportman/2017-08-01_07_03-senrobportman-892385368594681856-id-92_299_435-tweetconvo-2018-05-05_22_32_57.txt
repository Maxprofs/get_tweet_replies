U can keep trying to divert people's attention but the priorities are secure borders, healthcare and lower taxes. U can be voted out!
so.............when does @realDonaldTrump exit?
also known as the Trump Act
Trump is a sex trafficer.
This is very interesting, since I've heard that there are some Republicans involved with 45's human trafficking ring!
thank you for moving to bipartisanship, this is a start.  Keep up the good work. Fix ACA with Dem's. No more talk of repeal.
Investigate http://TrumpModels.com   please
Significent! Something valuable might get done!
Now if you could PLEASE work in a BIPARTISAN effort to fix the ACA!
Starting with the head of your party?
#NeverForget @AltNatSecAgency @AltCyberCommand @TrueFactsStated @20committee
You know your president @realDonaldTrump is allegedly involved in this act, right?
45 has been linked to exploiting models and child abuse of models since the 90's. out assoc with David Casablancas & Jeff Epstein. Rapers.
I thought the House has to impeach @realDonaldTrump ?
This is just pre-cover for when the truth comes out
One assumes you would also support NYAG' s investigation of Trump Model Management and that Trump be deposed in Jeffrey Epstein case?
"Enable state officials, not just the fed Dept. of Justice, to act against individuals/businesses that violate fed sex trafficking laws."
ICYMI (before the election) this subject was widely reported and needs to be reinvigorated. #EndHumanTrafficking
. The problem is that his supporters have zero problem with this sort of thing.
Some of them, true.
You mean trump's modeling agency?
Thanks. Now I have to go shower.
Excellent. Will this Act require law enforcement to follow the evidence no matter where it leads? No matter how powerful the perp is?
Great, now how about BIPARTISAN fix of ACA, Articles of Impeachment for #TreasonousTrump and get @ScottPruittOK the hell out of the @EPA !
And that's just before lunch on day 1.
Thank you! Any act by congress of an upright and otherwise positive nature is healing our nation.
Sex & human trafficking is a horrific crime Thats why Trump should be investigated for the possibility of his involvement in this industry
He is being investigated for human trafficking!
Amazing bipartisan bill by @senrobportman @clairecmc @SenBlumenthal @SenJohnMcCain -to clarify that hosting child sex ads is no longer legal
Thank you! What I'd like more is for u all to rally to impeach DT &make sure the #SanctionsBill Is signed.Pls make it happen
Hope you see the seriousness re thesanctions? If they're lifted holy hell breaks loose.Putin controls WH, that's not cool
Our children deserve to be free. Modern day slavery is a current crisis online affecting American children everyday.  #EndHumanTrafficking
Modern day slavery isn't limited to human trafficking, is the only thing. This limited-scope approach seems a bit short-sighted.
Donald #Trump is a human trafficker. http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2016/08/31/former-trump-models-allege-financial-exploitation-while-employed-without-work-visas/ …
Boy that's sure going to throw a wrench in the Trump\GOP Trafficking Empire!
Finally - this is a positive step
Do you think Trump would veto?  @TrumpModels
#RepealObamacare
Very important work. Thank you, Senator Portman.
Why don't you just call it the Trump Model Management Act?
They MAY want to discuss with @realDonaldTrump first.  Legend has it HE was involved in human trafficking - which is being investigated.
You should be part of the Stop Enabling Worthless Spineless Senators Act. That's a bill we can all get behind! #TermLimits
This is excellent news!
What possibly would be a reason you would not be apart of introducing this legislation @joniernst @ChuckGrassley ???
Start aggressive arrest and prosecution of the "customers" who buy, use, and discard these unfortunates.
Are you tracking state of MD and its continued effort to extend the SOL for child abuse?  Awful! #TheKeepers
We'll have to see if he'll actually sign it... much like the Sanctions bill that's still out there pending 45's 'review'
Some of them employed through my model agencies, as house maids in Mar-a-Lago, or in whatever function. As long as I can arrange a visum.
I'd really like 2 talk 2 U about this and other issues. Which day r u going to the Fair? Let's have a good old fashioned #StateFairTownHall
Fine idea.
Very safe. Who could oppose that? Cowards! How about standing up to treasonous Trump?
Oh Rob, dear.
You have NO idea how popular #HumanTrafficking is about to become again.
@realDonaldTrump has been doing it for years.
Great~~ can yall start with pedophile island Trumps/ Clintons/ Epstein! 
Does it apply retroactively to Government officials, Senator?
You guys should really start looking into Trump Modeling. 
You might start with Trumps modeling business.
Thank you! 
Our children aren't commodities to be bought and sold online. # I Am Jane Doe
ENOUGH. We dont wanna hear from you this way, we can't trust anything you say. You need to #talktous IN PERSON. #REALTownHallNOW
#scheduleit
Healthcare.  Trump modeling. Impeachment.
Clean your house first Rob!
I hope it includes a very long statute of limitations.
Will this include Trump & friends?
Also known as Articles of Impeachment for Donald J Trump.
So you found out Trumper likes little girls, eh? How about impeachment proceedings? The GOP is a bunch of cowards!
Then you'd better stop your President!
Portman is A RINO and a stupid one at that. Good luck on election with no support

.@DMRegister: "Trump's threat to cut Obamacare funding could cause IA premiums to spike even more" #TrumpPremiumTax

Today, Hatch admitted he has given up on bipartisan health care reform. Since he won't reach across aisle, Utahns deserve someone who will.

.@SenatorBaldwin: “It is time to put aside these efforts to sabotage, to destroy, and to repeal & replace” #TheBeat 

Thank you for telling your stories and making your voices heard. Millions of people will keep their healthcare because of what you did. 
You know that Trump's modelling agency trafficed young girls, right?
Might be part of what's driving this bill.
That would be a super passive aggressive way of handling Donald and his  crime buddies.

Because of your bravery in sharing your stories, Ohioans will keep their healthcare coverage. Fewer families will live in fear.…
1 Question why on earth do we need Congress to pass a new law for this? 
Where the hell has our Law Enforcement including the FBI been ?

.@POTUS' refusal to make payments is driving uncertainty in healthcare markets, raising rates. It's the #TrumpPremiumTax. 
This is pure Sabotage by the President to force GOP to pass another #DeathCare Bill leaving millions without any Healthcare.

19 counties in Ohio once thought to be bare have been covered.
Now 19 counties in US (0.1% of enrollees) are at risk https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.wordpress.com/interactive/counties-at-risk-of-having-no-insurer-on-the-marketplace-exchange-in-2018/?preview_id=222123&preview_nonce=9cf205324c&_thumbnail_id=-1&preview=true … 

On the floor of the United States #Senate, @SenJohnMcCain encouraged colleagues to return to #regularorder and work #acrosstheaisle. 
See news on @AGSchneiderman case on #TrumpModels and human trafficking.  Seems important...indictments coming.

Senator Hirono's emotional final plea against WealthCare didnt get much recognition. Sharing it with you. 
When is your next townhall , @senrobportman ? #healthcare
Trafficker in Chief will be most displeased

Children’s hospitals agree: the Republican health care bill would be devastating & have life-or-death consequences.

you mean articles of impeachment ?
What's bipartisanship, Rob?
