So is unaffordable universal healthcare. Please don't vote for #GrahamCassidyBill
Stripping healthcare from millions just so GOP can get fat donations is even more of a stain. You are NOT a bipartisan. #GrahamCassidyNO
Voting yes on the Graham-Cassidy bill will forever be a STAIN on your character and your career. FU, Rob. FU!!
#VoteNOGrahamCassidy
#GrahamCassidy would cut federal health funding for Ohio by $161 Billion through 2036 according to @CenterOnBudget. #WTF
Is #RobPortman a #Conservative or a dangerous #Radical? HIS VOTE will speak volumes to the American people.
If you vote to reorder one-sixth of the US economy without a CBO score, never call yourself conservative again. You are a dangerous radical.
Forget this issue. Why are you voting to steal from Red states. To give to Blue states healthcare dollars. https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/policy-and-politics/2017/9/20/16338370/graham-cassidy-rewards-anti-obamacare-states …
Wow! #PhotoOpRob standing up for an issue everyone agrees on. Way to not stick your neck out! #Pay4PlayPolitician
#GrahamCassidy and voting No should be the only thing you are tweeting about.  It is the most important things on the minds of constituents.
You've certainly attracted a bunch of trolls! Thank you for your effort to STOP human trafficking. Repeal Obamacare as soon as possible.
Don't hide from Graham Cassidy. You have a responsibility to put it on the line. Are you going to stay silent again? Spineless
Keep talking about anti-sex trafficking, meanwhile supporting pussy-grabber Trump. Are U also gonna support the latest GOP healthcare crap?
Sure wish you were equally obsessed with a commonsense, bipartisan approach to healthcare.
There may be $400million reasons for the GOP to support Graham-Cassidy, but how much of that will you get? Is it worth your career?
Vote no on Graham-Cassidy. Don't inflict pain on your fellow Americans.
Did you know sex traffickers use emoji symbols to communicate with buyers? http://www.skepticalworld.com/sex-trafficking-emoji-social-media-michigan/ …
I understand this issue is important, but right now ACA repeal that will hurt Ohioans is being debated and we want to know where you stand.
Answer your phoneRob
Canceling maternity care is a stain on our national character as well, and that’s what #GrahamCasiddy wants to do. Vote #GrahamCassidyNO
How about bipartisan work on healthcare? The Republican healthcare bill is draconian. How can you not stand against that!
Another stain is senators who sell out their constituents for money from billionaires.
Yeah, Rob, can you imagine the weak will and greed of a person who would do that?
If you vote yes on #GrahamCassidy you will be a bigger stain than ALL traffickers combined!
Totally!
#GrahamCassidy is a stain on your personal character if you vote yes.
Hey .@senrobportman how about a common sense bipartisan approach to health care for these victims next? #noGrahamCassidy
Vote no on #GrahamCassidyِ
Everyone supports this, now move on and vote NO to protect all of us from #GrahamCassidy .
As you vote to take healthcare from victims of opioids and human trafficking try to remember @potus is colluding with murderous Russians
This is a great thing you're doing, another great thing would be to vote NO on #GrahamCassidy
#CassidyGraham WILL be a stain on our national character. Vote NO on #CassidyGraham
What planet R U from? done reading the shitty health care bill yet? A solid no vote on last minute major legislation should be easy to do.
No, first he will tweet a picture of himself reading it to convey an air of "serious consideration"
ah yes that fake "I promise I really do care about your health care and not rich people can't you tell by the way I am sitting" photo op.
The real stain on our national character is the Republican majority in the Senate and their desire to rip health care from 32 million

"To date, not one major health care industry or advocacy group has expressed support for the Graham-Cassidy plan."

#SenRobPortman is a stain on our national character if he votes yes on Graham Cassidy.  #BadForOhio
How about you lead on bipartisan healthcare reform and NOT vote for the disaster that is Cassidy-Graham.
Graham-Cassidy allows insurers to NOT cover:
-Pregnancy
-Newborn care
-Mental health services
-Prescription drugs
-Rehab
-Birth control
Stop with word bipartisan.  I want to see you watching the Health hearings happening Listen to your governor, be bipartisan.  Vote NO
It's the Portman bot posting today.
The voicemail box in your office is full.  Any chance your constituents could get a for/against Graham Cassia on the voicemails? 43221
so is the latest attempt to repeal healthcare. Are you going to tweet your thoughts about that at all?
Another stain will be passing the Graham-Cassidy bill.  #MedicareForAll #TimeIsNOW
Glad that both parties could come together over this issue! Would so appreciate you joining the #VoteNo on #GRAHAMCASSIDY
Vote NO on Graham-Cassidy

It is indeed a stain. What about a bipartisan effort to #FixACA so victims can afford necessary access to healthcare? #NOGrahamCassidy
Your failure to repeal and replace the ACA is a stain on your character.
Is our national character to deny healthcare to children, pregnant women, disabled & elderly? &  price working Americans out of healthcare?
#GrahamCassidy is a stain on the #GOP character! Vote NO on this death bill! Millions of lives are at stake!
The large volume of tweets your staff posts on this says you really care about this.  And the lacks of tweets on #GrahamCassidy says what?
We need a bipartisan healthcare effort. These people need medical care. #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
other stains on our national character: Trump; GOP death care bills, Trump, Russian highjacking the US elections; Trump...shall I go on?
The GOP is selling American lives with Graham Cassidy just as bad as human trafficking. Your vote would be a death stain on America VOTE NO!
Removing healthcare from ppl is also a stain on our national character.  Vote no on Cassidy-Graham.
If you vote for this, the stain is on your soul Rob.
too bad you want to take away the mental & health care these women will need! #noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy
#SESTA  makes me think of the Patriot act.  Erosion of freedom in the name of safety. Any assurance it won't be manipulated against citizens
Yes, we all agree, Senator. 

How do you plan to vote on Graham-Cassidy, or stripping protections answer healthcare from your constituents?
Can we focus on bipartisan healthcare for a sec? #NotoGrahamCassidy
Are you a rubber stamp for the failing Trump agenda?Does 32 million uninsured people make you proud? Gutting Medicaid? Country before party
You know what else is a stain? Taking healthcare from millions of Americans like @SenateMajLdr and @BillCassidy want to do.
This advocacy means NOTHING if these victims are denied healthcare because of Graham-Cassidy.
Listen to our governor.. VOTE NO on Trumpcare
Vote no on Graham Cassidy!!!
I am thrilled you are doing this. NOW vote NO on the Graham Cassidy bill so millions dont lost their coverage and possible die. Even BCBS NO
There are MANY stains on this nation's character.
"Mirror, Mirror, on your wall....KARMA"  
GOTCHA RP
Graham-Cassidy is also a stain on our national character. Voting for it is a career-ending decision.
This administration is a heinous crime, get to work on that.
@realDonaldTrump is a stain on our national character.
Ummm, the "president" is a stain on our national character. Where's your concern about that???
#payattention
#whereyouatRob
#NoGrahamCassidy
What's the other pork that's packaged with this bill? What else are we signing on to with this important issue?
Healthcare should be bipartisan also. vote no On #GrahamCassidyBill
Your tacit support for Graham-Cassidy is a stain on your character, which was already pretty soiled by your Trump fandom.
