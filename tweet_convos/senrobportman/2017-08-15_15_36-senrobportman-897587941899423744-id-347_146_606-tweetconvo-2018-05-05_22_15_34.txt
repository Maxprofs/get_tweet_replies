It's so cute the way you think being a Trump yes man will get you re-elected. Ohio is changing and their changing their minds on you
What are you going to do about Trump?
We will all help you & add something you forgot in your tweet @realDonaldTrump @POTUS -but I know asking him to speak clearly is a challenge
Since trump has been elected you have moved father to the right and not been a moderat
Say his name senator or you are complicit
Not supporting a move to censure the president will be seen as silent collaboration.
And against @realDonaldTrump who refuses to speak out clearly? Or maybe you agree with Trump?
Say his name , Senator. We call  on you to denounce the racist bigot in WH who descended upon America by name : Trump
The continued attack on the President of innuendo by the hateful and biased media as well as by weak rep politicians will not be unnoticed
Sen. Portman, David French of the National Review as done this:
http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/450574/donald-trump-tweet-fake-history-libel-war-crime …
Please read this and call for Trump to resign.
This is a pretty milquetoast response. Why aren't you publically bringing Trump to account for his remarks blaming "both sides"?
You understand how to use the @ symbol right? @POTUS . Big deal you posted against racism. You don't get a medal for that. Stand up to Trump
Yes rather than saying we must speak, speak out yourself.  It is time to call out @realDonaldTrump by name.  Your silence is complicity.
When will you condemn the president who stands with white supremacists? Your constituents are waiting, and we will not forget.
Still waiting for you to take a lead in Congress responding to the WH on support of KKK and Neo Nazi. #actionsOverWordsGOP
Say his name. Denounce the Mad King "President" by name. He needs to go. And if you don't think so, so do you.
Maybe you could criticize @realDonaldTrump and get on board with @LindseyGrahamSC, @JeffFlake & @BobCorker? 
Or read

What about the hatred & racism from the WH? Your moral duty: #Impeachment
We don't need tweets we need action! Censure now
Name and shame this racist in the white house. Also...
This is some weak sauce... take a stronger stand. Look up to McCain and Kasich. Speak against Trump. Unendorse Mandell.
"We"? Why don't YOU do it? You have the opportunity to do so. Stop tweeting this gutless tripe and stand up. RU spineless?
Will you speak out against the AnitFA attacks on our right of freedom of expression?  #gutless
Pathetically weak take.
I am your constituent,  I called your office today asking you to denounce Trump. You fell very short of doing so. What does this say about u
There must be something the Senate can do now that we know Nazis have control of the White House
You must speak out clearly specifically against "Mr. President", as Marco Rubio did. Otherwise it's just stating the obvious.
Agreed! Speak clearly and #SayHisName #DoSomethingGOP #impeach #25thAmendmentNow
Get with the @SenateDems 
#impeach our Nazis sympathizer president
Time to #DoSomethingGOP 
He has been given every chance and at every turn he has proven himself #UnfitForOffice 
He must be removed!
Then why are you afraid to say the Presidents name? Why not lay the blame where it lies, Donald Trump is a racist, a Nazi sympathizer. Sad
Seriously? This anemic response? Speak out clearly against President Trump, who took days to take the pretty simple step of rejecting hate.
Here's the guy Josh Mandel supports, posing with Nazi Richard Spencer during the RNC. Unendorse Mandel, I am your constituent.
Unendorse Mandel immediately. He stands with right-wing conspiracy theorists.
If you are serious, you must get the white supremacists out of our White House
Sign the censure put forth by @RepJerryNadler
In 1927, Fred Trump was arrested during a clash between KKK and police. No susprise his son defends Nazi rioters. Thanks for speaking out.
Trump has spoken "clearly". He serves "select" Americans. Not all. You need to call him out by name as well. Why is everyone afraid of him?
We know what you are when it comes time to cast your vote.  Portman = Trump.  Don't pretend anything else.
Talk is cheap Rob. Stand up to tRump and stop being his lap dog. Do you represent Ohio or the GOP?
You need to watch this! Charlottesville: Race and Terror: Vice News Tonight on HBO
Who exactly is "We"? Does it include the leader of your party? The one you endorsed and serve? Grow a pair and SAY HIS NAME!
I guess "WE" doesn't include POTUS or you'd have mentioned him by name. You're as big a traitor as he is! OH-16 44708
if you don't stand up to @realDonaldTrump and Bannon you, sir are the problem, not the solution. #denounce
actions speak louder than words
"Trump", say it, "Trump is unfit to lead", say it again, "Trump is unfit to lead", again, "Trump is unfit to lead".  See how easy?
White supremacy is built on Nationalism which has replaced Patriotism in @GOP
#FireBannonMillerGorka 
http://www.differencebetween.net/language/difference-between-nationalism-and-patriotism/ …
You need to denounce President Trump and his bigoted hate speech. Why are you silent about this train wreck administration?
And the President. Say it Rob, say it. #ImpeachTrump I'll be calling more offices this afternoon. Talk soon, buddy...
And even more importantly, YOU MUST speak out against a president who is normalizing that behavior with false equivalence of "both sides".
So why aren't you?? You can see what is happening. Please, you and the rest of the GOP must stop this once and for all.
You must speak out against Trump, who is shaming the office of POTUS. *you are the one with power. Not calling DT out by name is consent.
When are you going to publicly denounce @realDonaldTrump ? Then you will be speaking clearly
Actions not words but if you speak name names! Call out trump, many of those racists were from Ohio, make a difference here please
Sorry Rob you get no brownie points for condemning Nazis. You must condemn their de facto leader who happens to be the Prez
Took you long enough.
The president harbors terrorists and you find the courage to tweet. Tweets are not leadership. Your country needs you. Act.
Grow a spine @senrobportman The racist in the White House has a name, Trump! Say it Rob then I'll believe you! #DoSomethingGOP
Speaking out clearly means naming the head enabler. #trumpisaracist
So predictable. Send a tweet condemning what the President says, now it all goes away. Fyi this is not going away.
Senator, with all due respect, you in power need to  call out the President to speak out clearly against Nazis and white supremacists.
Then speak clearly, censure @realDonaldTrump  and help move his impeachment along.  Not saying his name shows you support his ideas.
"Speak out"... then DO SOMETHING!
You are clearly unable to speak out against a @POTUS who has drawn a false equivalency between white supremacists and those who oppose them.
Say his name and condemn him  #TrumpIsANazi
Where do you stand on the President's remarks Senator?
You must also denounce the president who defends and enables them. Donald Trump must be condemned by all people of conscience.
"Speaking out clearly" means actually condemning @realDonaldTrump for his words.
Thank you.
It's easy to speak out against hate, bigotry and unnamed white supremacists. You must speak out against the PRESIDENT who caters to it!
Actions speak louder than words @senrobportman
You best huddle up with your GOP pals and figure out WTF to do, because the ahole in the White House is tearing us up!
It wasn't just them you nimrod
Vote against Mandel. He is a racist.
Ask trump to take the statues for his properties! #Charlottesviille #Givetrumpstatues
If you really thought this you would withdraw your endorsement of Josh "I side with the alt right" Mandel. And yet you won't. Hypocrite.
Clearly? Then say his name. The one you went behind close doors to take away healthcare. Too little too late. You sided with Donald Trump.
@realDonaldTrump still commands our military. I do not believe he is to be trusted in this position. Please remove him ASAP. #ImpeachTrump
Then lead with action instead of just going rock step with a racist in Chief. You are an enabler and just as bad as the white supremacist
When will you show courage and condemn the hatred spewed by POTUS, Bannon, Miller? #ImpeachTrump
Why does @senrobportman & Senate Committee on Homeland Security refuse to hold hearings on White Supremacist, Neo-Nazi, Terrorism....???
"I condemn Donald Trump's remarks."

That's "speaking clearly," senator.
When will you speak out clearly and unambiguously against President Trump? It's long past time.
You have to denounce @realDonaldTrump @POTUS or these tweets from @GOP mean nothing
Yes. Please speak out against this President. Directly.
The president said "there were good people there protesting" do you agree?
Seriously, we're going on day 5 here & you're still saying the same thing? How about take action by removing this unfit lunatic from office?
You must also speak out against those that fail to condemn these groups. Speak out against Trump & assert congressional strength! #resist
So say it clearly.   trump won't
Republicans-you've sold your souls for a cheap shot at power and tax cuts. The only salvation is impeachment.
Speaking out clearly is not sufficient. Trump needs to go. There is no room in the US for a racist, White Supremacist in the White House.
Alright. You're getting there. Now back up these words with action. Start DOING what's right too.
Stand strong for a free press and tell Trump he cannot infringe upon their rights. #ImpeachTrumpNow
Then stand tall and speak out against Trump and his vile racism as shown in  his press conference today. #ImpeachTrumpNow
Disagree. *I* as a citizen must "speak out." You as a sitting Senator must do much, much, MUCH more.
Become the moral voice of your party!!
#ImpeachTrumpNow
What ACTION are you taking to protect us from this racism and domestic terrorism?
How many of them voted for you? Did the driver who killed the peaceful protestors vote for you, too? How much have you contributed to this?
You realize today is Tuesday...this all happened on Saturday...
You seem a bit slow on ur response time, Senator.
#ImpeachTrump
Yes.  There is only one group responsible for Charlottesvile.  Since our president disagrees we all need to stand together against racism.
Your words are just words. 
Actions speak louder than words.
#ImpeachTrump
Choose a side, Senator. Do you stand with American's or Nazi's? 
Seems like we know where ur pres stands. Choose wisely history is watching.
SAY HIS NAME.
Why did you vote for Trump? Says a lot about your judgment of character. Really let Ohio down.
We ARE, Senator. You need to act and remove someone who's chosen sides with followers of an ideology our fathers defeated in WW II.
You endorse Josh Mandel.  Mandel is alt right. You keep poor company, Rob. #YouWillBeHeldAccountable
You have 1911 days to take action. Show Ohioans you mean what you say. #countdown2022 #thisisnotus
#GuantanamoforTrump #EVIL #ImpeachTrumpPenceNOW @SenJohnMcCain @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski  @davereichert @nytimes @LindseyGrahamSC @WSJ
Trump doesn't say anything negative about the Russians or white supremacists....why is that??
they were having peaceful protest until BLM group came with weapons and no permit.  2 sides here
I'm sickened by DJT's words and the fact that u will not speak out against him! Mandel is part of the problem 2, but we'll get to that later
...so speak out!  Name your president!   Now is not the time to mince words!  Demand your president specifically denounce white supremacists
How about the hatred, racism and white supremacists who descended an elevator and then descended upon the White House? Anything?
Yes we must including the trump, what are u gong to do
What about YOU speaking it clearly because so far you are failing to so so.
What are you going to DO about it? You blindly follow a @POTUS who defends Nazis.
Speak out against the other side also.
Stop being politically correct.
Being my senator I want you to have the courage to tell the President in clear words that he is wrong. Stand up for truth Sentor.
Friend, we all need to speak louder, and hold the President accountable.  Please
But you won't say that Trump is leading the haters,racists and white supremacist. Bye Felicia
'We the People' who are #AmericaFirst believe that ALL Racism is wrong. #AllLivesMatter #HistoryPreserved is Not to be repeated.
Condem both the guilty parties mr portman. Antifa, the white supremacy and all the other hate groups. None have a place in america!
Sooooo, when are you going to make a stand against Trump Rob???? Spineless coward or true patriot, you decide....
So speak out and condemn the President.  What does it take for the Republican Party to stand up against this insanity?
Then you must speak out clearly against @realDonaldTrump
You must now speak out clearly against this morally bankrupt president. Easy to denounce hatred, racism, etc. Alan Hirsch, Hilliard voter.
glad you see this as more important than trafficking and addiction.  you need to get more of your priorities straight
Really? So what steps do you have planned to remove the white supremacist from the White House?
Please end your support of Mandel and tell the president to kick Bannon, Miller, and Gorka out of the WH.
Then start working with your colleagues to remove the cancerous traitor in the Oval Office.
Spk out against hatred, racism &white supremacists?  How bout Trump? Surreal u don't say HE is unacceptable 
Cowards&appeasers
Tell W.H. that Bannon must go and FBI must go after white hate groups. Actions speak louder than words, Senator.
People criminal damage public works of
Art must be prosecuted there can not be a double standard
Talk is cheap. What are you going to do to protect us & the United States from Trump?
Senator, I beg you to stand up against our President. His words shows where he stands! He is fueling hatred!  #Charlotteville
And BLM!
Will you do that? That means speaking out against POTUS. Where are your balls?
Maybe you should call upon those not giving a clear response... ie potus
Not just speak out, but ACT. What are you going to DO about the domestic terrorists being radicalized in our state? Or POTUS defending them?
Too little. Too late. Ohio has a long memory, Rob.
Words are nice, but not enough. Please take action now. The USA cannot continue with a racist president. #actionsnotwords #impeach
We must speak out against the hatred, racism and white supremacists that have taken hold of the White House.  #ImpeachTrumpNow
You must call out Trump for not doing so.
And against those who would accept it and enable it. But I have t heard that yet.
It is time, past time really, for YOU to speak out clearly against PRESIDENT TRUMP. Publicly disavow any support for him! Censure him!
You forgot to tag @realDonaldTrump.
And it's your job to stop supporting #46! Actions will always speak louder than words! #Charlottesviille #impeach
Whoops #45 not #46!
Say his name. @realDonaldTrump is the problem here. Don't hide behind we.
Why didn't any of the Republicans and Dems speak out about the hate and racism of BLM. You all are hypocrites. What happen to repeal OC BTW
Your president is one of them. He just couldn't make the occasion. Now what?
@senrobportman Yes, we must. When will you speak out against @POTUS @realDonaldTrump and his hatred, racism, and white supremacist views?
Honorable Senator Portman, words are no longer adequate. Action is necessary. Will you and your colleagues lead? It's past time to impeach.
We need more than Twitter statements, senator. You need to publicly denounce Trump and his administration if you truly mean this.
And by "we", you mean who, exactly?
I'm much more concerned about the ones who descended on Washington.
How is it that you guys always say the right thing but you never actually DO the right thing?
Then speak out against the hatred and racism in the White House.
You can't speak clearly if you won't condemn Trump's statements. Yet instead you continue to support him,
No time like the present, Rob. Forget Tweeting and grab a microphone. There's still time to make tonight's 11 o'clock news. Condemnation now
Tweet this to POTUS, Rob. Prove it.
The president is right. Any and all who were violent no matter their name or label.
In public, Rob, not in the Senate cloakroom. Say something in public, @senrobportman  You must condemn DT or held accountable as a scumbag.
Then invoke the 25th..NOW. #25thAmendmentNow
Weak, weak, weak.
Action speaks louder than words. Do something about your so called leader. It's past time for the GOP to do something. He will destroy U.S.
How about denouncing your out of control President? Grow a pair.
Ok, but are you going to speak out against their leader Trump? Where is your red line? How far does he have to go before you stop him?
And you must speak out against the Republican President who has encouraged them. And courted their favor. And still does.
Then stand behind your President when he calls it out! That city mayor is totally responsible 4 wh happened w/t riots! Damn dims R idiots!
Totally agree, Senator.

Now do something to effectively counteract POTUS.
then do it, out president clearly didn't hear you
Then speak clearly. Enough of this tiptoeing around the orange elephant in the room. Denounce @realDonaldTrump already.
Start with the nazis in our WH. If you continue to support this madman, you're on the wrong side of history. #ImpeachTrump
"We" ARE speaking out. Your continued support of 45 and your endorsement of Mandel say you are not with us.
Immoral tool.
Actions speak louder than words, Mr. Senator
Yet your president won't .
Then you need to stand up to the man making excuses for them #ImpeachTrumpNow
Fish stinks from the head down.  He is leading the GOP!
Call @realDonaldTrump out.
Country before party!
Hey Rob, how about speaking out against all racism.  There are black as well as white supremacists.  Racism goes both ways.  Wise up
I think it's time for the 25th amendment. Trump sinking fast and taking GOP with him.
They're racists & bigots plain and simple.
Speaking out is a start; DO SOMETHING. You have the power. You have the responsibility. #Impeach #FireGorka #FireBannon #FireMiller #ohio
Just words. We want action. Now. Impeach.
what does this even mean @senrobportman ?
I'm speaking against hate: Gorka, Bannon, Miller, Trump. Can you hear?
Senator Portman, can you be more specific in who exactly should be speaking out?
Then switch parties.
Are lower taxes for the rich & fewer regs really worth this?  Repub agenda at all costs...is that the plan? THIS IS ON YOU!
Silence=Consent
Tell POTUS.  Disavow his siding of Nazis and White Supremacists.  Gut check.
Impeach 45
