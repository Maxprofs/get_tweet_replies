LBJ doesn't play anything higher than 7 seed in 1st round
Did he lose

JR should be tested after the behind the back pass to no one.
Great sweep. However, Kyrie needs to shoot better and Love has to contribute something next series. Lebron in playoff mode. Greatest ever!

Coach Lue... is the boom... pray and then play... COACH LUE!!! #GooooCavs
Good game! Sweep!


The King has put his crown on  #DefendtheLand
Hope to see y'all in the second round! #rematch

Gotta fix that 4th Q...
George's teammates should be commenting on why you don't give him the ball in clutch situations
SWEEEEEP! Let's goo boys , now let's get some rest and be ready for round 2. Proud of the team so far
lbj= goat
As long as he gets some help when he gets beat they'll be alright.
The fact that they're now playing better Team Defense is what can get them over the hump.
Yea
Rest up and get ready for the next series! #DefendtheLand
