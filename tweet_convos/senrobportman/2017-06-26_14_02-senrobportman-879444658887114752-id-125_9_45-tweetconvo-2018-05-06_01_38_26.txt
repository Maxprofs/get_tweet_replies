The Senate Health "care" bill would devastate opiod recovery programs you claim to support. You MUST vote NO on this bill.
Yet you would vote yes on #Trumpcare which cuts Medicaid for millions of addicts who need treatment. This is just a political football for u
My parents were 1st responders, I'm a #copkid but you don't seem to care about supporting their quest not to have their kid die from #BCRA.
Did you know that the Senate version of #Trumpcare only allocates one year of support against the opioid crisis? VOTE NO IN ALL FORMS
I love your bio! 
They do, which is why you need to vote NO on the Senate hc legislation. #Trumpcare devastates Medicaid, underfunds addict'n help.
Vote no on ACHA, ohio demands it.
So vote "NO" on the health care bill in the Senate! #Bad4Ohio
Clear your voicemails and take our calls. #NoAHCA #NoTrumpCare
good work. stop supporting trump. he is evil,ignorant, dangerous.
you better not support that health care bill...don't sell us out to big insurance industry and rich people.
Vote NO! This Healthcare bill is a mass murder, survival of the fittest. Stop killing our vets, seniors, children, women etc.
Don't tell me, we each cant give up a cup of coffee a day to keep everyone insured! I drink bout 4-5 a day. I'll give up all!
Take from my paycheck! Tax it! 
You aren't supporting them when you won't commit to voting no on the GOP health care bill
You know what else on front lines? Medicaid. #voteno #thisisinsanity
Will you be on the front-line against the fight against addiction by speaking out against the Senate Health Bill and voting "NO"?
Agree! And after 1st response the next step is immediate effective treatment - regardless of ability to pay if we want safe communities.
Vote no on AHCA! I don't understand how taking away people's health care coverage, particularly mental health care, fights addiction. 43209
your constituents deserve a sen who fights for them, not the repub party.  Vote no and speak out against "health care" bill.

This man & his family are dear friends of mine. Losing Rebecca devastated an entire community. Please read his poignant story #NoTrumpcare https://twitter.com/meyerweb/status/879440253223923714 …
PLEASE VOTE NO....PLEASE.
AHCA is bad for those with opioid addictions.  On behalf of Ohioans and all of America-- Just say NO to AHCA.
...then maybe you shouldn't have helped author an attack on their funding.
Be a first responder and vote no on the new healthcare bill save lives !!!
But how overwhelmed will they be if you vote yes to healthcare bill? When they are the only care because small rural hospitals close?

McConnell is trying to buy Sen Portman's vote with an inadequate amount of money/resources to treat opioid crisis in Ohio. Don't let him.
Vote no on #Trumpcare. The people of Ohio deserve more! It's up to you. Listen to YOUR constituents. They are begging you to vote no.
Save Medicaid
Portman sold his soul & sold his constituants out for a mere $382,100!!!
And they need health care as well.  VOTE NO!!
Vote NO on Trumpcare and support first responders and all Ohioans.
Good luck in 2018. Koch's can't help you out of this one.
Vote no for healthcare bill that will cause rural hospitals to close bc ppl won't have insurance to pay bills.

Out of the 13 members of the secret @GOP health-care committee, you are the third highest recipient of BIG PHARMA $$$$$$$$$. Please explain.
Then vote no on the crazy healthcare bill.
If the bill passes, the Office for Opioid Safety at MetroHealth in Cleveland could close, because MetroHealth could close. And you know it.
You just met with the Pres of MetroHealth. You know the facts & figures better than we do. Your non-stance is disingenuous.
Yes, first responders deserve our support but not the idiots who overdose and expect to be revived by Narcan doses. Put $ to better use
Healthcare- mental healthcare- is the first line of defense- before the overdose- #voteno do what is right people before politics
If this is TRULY an issue you care about then you should #VoteNoBCRA
Addicts deserve our support, too.  #VoteNoAHCA #22Millionreasons
First responders may deserve our support, but people over age 60, children and people who are sick NEED healthcare! Vote NO ON TRUMPCARE!
A healthcare plan that kicks people off heathcare is not plan! #Notrumpcare #countryoverparty
If only your voting record matched the misleading tweets you send out...
Then don't take their healthcare or you are only pretending to care.
Medicaid cuts will keep addicts from being able to get help.
Do more than tweet, NO on #Trumpcare!
All Ohioans deserve our support.  Perhaps you should save their healthcare? That would be an excellent, supportive move. #ProtectOurCare
Vote no on trumpcare
Vote no!
Senator, I urge you to vote NO on the AHCA! More people w/o healthcare within ONE year, higher premiums..the elderly, sick and poor harmed.
Indeed they do. We all need MedicareForAll and BasicIncomeForAll People in Oh. can't afford premiums now or deductibles #Ins.Scam
Fraud.
Please vote #NoBRCA
Which means you should vote NO on #AHCA.
They also deserve a healthcare system that provides service for addicts.
Don't settle for token support in the AHCA. It's inadequate. #PortmanVoteNo
Vote no
What @cath_bax said!
Support them by voting no on that abhorrence of a health care bill. #NoBCRA
Does this mean you won't support @SenateMajLdr's craven attacks on your addicted constituents?
First responders (and literally ever other American) will be negatively affected by BCRA. Vote no. Put human lives over your party line.
And they will Not have jobs when you cut Medicaid by voting in favor of #Trumpcare
Don't cut Medicaid. Vote no on trumpcare
yes they do deserve support, no Medicaid cuts help save lives of those addicted to opioids. Vote NO on senate AHCA bill
If you truly care for Ohio sir, kill the bill
I'm glad you're doing this. I like you working with @amyklobuchar too. :-)
22 million.
you constituents deserve ur support! Taking healthcare away from people will cost lives! Vote no on #BCRA! #ProtectOurCare
You don't "save" medicaid by denying anyone to use it!
You know who else deserves our support? Pregnant women along with the millions of others losing their healthcare so the rich can get richer
Pre existing conditions are just as important. Your healthcare bill would be a death sentence to millions.for once in your life take a stand
These people will be left to die with #TrumpCare along with people like me with auto-immune disorders requiring regular treatment #NoAHCA
HOW YA VOTING ON #DeathCareBill
VOTE NO to this heartless Wealthcare (rich people richer) Mr Portman, or the addicts will just die instead of getting the help they need!
Addiction and HEALTH insurance go hand in hand Senator. Vote no on trumpcare or this problem will get increasingly worse !!!
Indeed they do. We also need to maintain ACA. Vote with your conscience, VOTE NO
45044-Vote No on the horrifying Trump healthcare bill! Vote with @SenSherrodBrown
Now is time to step up and reform heath care. ALL americans should be covered. Universal coverage not insurance companies that deny care!!!!
Then vote NO on Trumpcare! Otherwise posts like these saying you support first responders in the opioid crisis prove U R a hypocrite & liar
You know who deserves your support? The 633,151 disabled Ohioans who will lose coverage if #trumpcare passes. #VoteNoAHCA
Trumpcare does nothing to help fight addiction. Vote no!
Think of our children living in homes with the addiction in the house but Trumpcare is not really caring. Please vote no for OHIO
The best way to support the fight IS TO VOTE NO ON THE AHCA
I agree w/ you! The answer is NOT cutting Medicaid funding/resources to hospitals & providers on the front line. Please vote NO on AHCA.
Do you really think your flood of tweets on the opioid crisis is going to fool anyone when you vote to gut Medicaid?
Yes they do, but the current healthcare bill definitely won't help them. It could increase their workload, and increase ER visits. Vote NO!
Cutting 22 million off health care or providing cheap coverage which covers nothing won't help.
You must mean moral support because your new Fedral budget decimates funding for local First Responders. But whatever Trump wants Trump gets
You're right. They also require you to be an advocate for Ohioans and healthcare. Vote No.
and screw 22m Citizens of the United States (who all you SOBs represent) to give 82m each to top 400 and how much to rest of #MoneyHoarders?
Do you plan on voting for #GOPTrumpCare taking away healthcare from 22m Americans?
Odd repugs didn't run on "Repeal Obamacare & Screw 22m"
how u can say you're fighting Opioid addiction and yet u were part of the 13 that wrote the Senate HC bill? Hypocrite much?
The ACA deserves your support. If we fix it, we can better fight the opioid crisis. Tweeting isnt enough. Kill the bill, not people.
#NoBCRA
I agree w/ you! The answer is NOT to cutting Medicaid funding/ resources to hospitals & providers on the front line. Please vote NO on AHCA.
Are you human? Or are you a trump-bot doing anything you can to distract us from this week's vote on 1/6th of the economy. Stop insulting us
Yes they do need our help... the health care bill will make it WORSE for responders and the people they are trying to treat!
So you're voting no on the bill?
ALL of your constituents deserve your support! No on #Trumpcare!
You could support them by voting against Trumpcare. It butchers Opioid addiction coverage.
Vote no on the disastrous trumpcare bill. People over Party.

Bill Cassidy says he's undecided on Trumpcare, but he made a promise to this cancer mom. Don't let him forget it.…

It seems fitting that, with the #TrumpCare debate raging, I got this bill in the mail today from Ethan's most recent open heart surgery.

150% of poverty= $9/hr for 40 hrs/wk. $6000=ONE THIRD of pre-tax income. So, choice becomes hc or rent, hc or food. #BCRA https://twitter.com/larry_levitt/status/878605553705943040 …
Totally agree. And those addicted need help, so like, let's not allow this "healthcare" bill to pass
