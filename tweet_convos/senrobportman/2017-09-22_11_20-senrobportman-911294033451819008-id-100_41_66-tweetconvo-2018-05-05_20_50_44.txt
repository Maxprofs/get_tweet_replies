Did you see McCain held to his values? How about you, Portman?
We pay for McCain to have and use the best insurance and you don’t care if he prevents poor people from having any insurance?
He's able to be treated for his cancer at Mayo Clinic because he doesn't have ACA. Most with ACA would be turned away.
Yep and we pay for his insurance.  He should be told to resign.
You can still say that you are a no vote on Graham Cassidy.
Vote no on the Graham-Cassidy bill, senator.

John McCain, a real hero.  You should emulate him and vote no on Trumpcare
Not to late to say NO on #GrahamCasiddy  bill and show that you have a conscience
Assuming he has the capability of being human! He's hiding behind those with enough courage to block it! Portman is a gutless wonder.
He won't say anything, the man has zero political courage. Maybe he'll come out against it when it's dead. Probably not.
u should act on the Gr-Cass. Bill or we will hold you accountable. Speak UP!  Vote NO!!
"I, Senator Rob Portman, oppose human trafficking."

So bold! So brave! What a courageous move!

/s
The Senate must act with urgency to fix DACA & healthcare, instead my "Senator" just published his 450,000th tweet about trafficking instead
Why don't you start at the top down?
yes and we must do this at the same time we take health coverage away from these women, including prenatal care. this sounds right to you?
Are you concerned enough about these women to protect their health care?
I agree but we also have other issues besides sex trafficking and drug addiction.
He's ignoring healthcare because he doesn't want to be associated with it. But he will vote along party lines.
OK, Senator, we all admire your courageous stand on a non controversial subject. What's your vote on Graham - Cassidy?
You are WRONG: the Senate must act with URGENCY on healthcare by voting down the Gr-Cass bill!  Do the right thing!
The Senate must also act in the best interest of ALL American people & not corporate interests. Vote NO on GrahamCassidy.
Senate must act with urgency to vote "no" on healthcare, if You truly care about women and children, you will vote no-actions vs words
Looks like another Senator who's been bribed!  Can't even do what his constituents are asking him to Do! Also going against his Governor!
The senate must act urgently to stop the repeal of healthcare from millions of Americans. Senate might also try to stop WWIII. Just saying
You need act to pass healthcare or  we wi vote you all out.  Fed up in Ohio
You should be acting with urgancy to oppose #GrahamCasiddy.
This is insulting. If you vote yes on Healthcare, the #1 issue this week, I cannot wait for you to be removed from the Senate floor.

Great.  How are you voting on healthcare?  It is good to be against sex trafficking but hardly brave. What are you doing on the brave vote.
You think the Senate should act with urgency about this, but you've got zero sense of urgency about 45*, nuclear war, DACA, Trans Ban, HC..?
Another crime against women & children would be Graham-Cassidy. How about acting with urgency by voting no?
The clock's ticking.
Stand for something stand with mccain #GrahamCassidyNO
We need health care too.
Will these victims have affordable health insurance under Graham-Cassidy?
Another crime? GrahamCassidy bill and your vote for this healthcare nightmare .#Save ACA
Graham-Cassidy is a crime against women, children, anyone with a pre-existing condition.
Still avoiding Graham-Cassidy. VOTE NO.
We agree @senrobportman and we still explicitly ask you to vote NO on #CassidyGrahamBill #CassidyGrahamBill. @SenKamalaHarris
VOTE NO TO THIS HEALTHCARE BILL!!! Your constituents want you too do it for us not for @realDonaldTrump
But it's okay to let students get assaulted on campus?! Pick up your phone and call @BetsyDeVosED Senator Portman. #DoYourJob

I'm proud of you, John. 

It's time for the resumption of the bipartisan Alexander/Murray plan, and I'm ready to help however I can. https://twitter.com/senjohnmccain/status/911290557191921664 …

I cannot in good conscience vote for Graham-Cassidy. A bill impacting so many lives deserves a bipartisan approach. http://bit.ly/2xtEuvz  
This is what a profile in courage looks like, Senator Portman. Take notes, you could learn a thing or two.
I see you are ducking an issue.  Ask for REPUBLICAN governor about Cassidy/Graham.  We are watching.  Election time.  The winds shift.
Tweets about this and all your photo ops for the week. Zero about #GrahamCassidy We aren't stupid, @robportman Your silence speaks volumes
Portman u sound  like CHELSEA CLINTON.......its not a good thing
Ohio is going to be one of the MOST HURT states under the proposed healthcare bill? When will you tell your constituents about your vote????
Rob. Sex & drugs
Then he votes to take away care Cassidy-Graham
The senate will act. U have been at the forefront of this epidemic & Ohioans applaud u but dont hide behind this concerning repeal/replace.
Its almost like you're taunting us on Twitter now with your silence on healthcare. Please join Sen #McCain and vote No #GrahamCassidyBill
Well done Senator Portman
No more waffling: vote NO on Graham-Cassidy.
The senate must act with urgency to block graham Cassidy and focus on bipartisan solutions to healthcare

@senrobportman Can we assume by this  your against not providing healthcare options to children Or r you suggesting Medicare will provide?
The GOP throws out these distractions when the real game is repeal Obamacare & permanetly stack taxes in favor of the rich.
Vote NO #GrahamCasiddy 
Please keep our healthcare
Equally Accessible
Affordable
And QUALITY
#ACA #AffordableCareAct #bipartisanFIXES
everyone can support this type of legislation, it takes a real HERO to champion health care for all. #cassidyGrahamNO
What is your position on Graham/Cassidy bill?? Speak up now!
OH would be 1 of the most hurt states under Graham/ Cassidy bill
Senator McCain did the right thing!
AGAIN senator, what about Ohio Veterans YOU made promises to.  NO SWEAT, YOUR replacement will be on the ballot.
TYPICAL, STINKIN, politicia
OH would be 1 of the states hurt the worst under Graham/Cassidy
Don't worry. Mc Cain will vote no. You will hide like always. Why don't you grow up along with the child like President! Just keep hiding.
time to back @SenJohnMcCain and come out against the #GrahamCassidyDeathBill
That's great! Now Congress must act to get rid of the dangerous man in OUR White House!
Look at what Betsy DeVose is doing .Are you two working at cross purposes ?? BTW vote NO on the health care bill..
#GrahamCassidy
Avalere, a consulting firm, modeled Graham-Cassidy's cap on Medicaid over time. Look what it does to children and the disabled. SAVAGE. 
Senator, we will hold you accountable for your vote on Graham-Cassidy.
you must be held accountable for refusing to acknowledge your constituents. #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
Accountable for crime against healthcare. . . urgently come out against #GrahamCassidy Senator.  Listen to your constituents, not donors.
Cancer families really needed another #SESTA tweet. You don’t answer our calls but you never miss a photo op Rob!
Helped kick off the fourth annual #VeloSano bike ride in downtown Cleveland tonight! #BikeToCure 
McCain just gave you some cover.....now come out NO on health care....#findaspine
The ball is in your court, Senator . Senator @SenJohnMcCain  made my day and millions of others. Let's keep it going, VOTE NO be Ohio's hero
Graham-Cassidy disproportionately targets low income women and children. Will you be accountable for them? #VoteNOGrahamCassidy #VoteNo
Portman is willing to let over 40,000 Americans die every year, because he sold his soul to the Koch Bros.
Make it four. PNHP also estimates 32M losing coverage under #GrahamCassidy, leading to 41,600 more deaths/year. http://bit.ly/2yvPZB1  https://twitter.com/TopherSpiro/status/911262067138711552 …
I can't believe you are this tone deaf.  Your constituents demand to hear your position on Graham-Cassidy.
yo Rob, John McCain might have saved you from having to make a decision. You gotta be feeling good.
No on #GrahamCasiddy
So you are going to vote "no" for the new health care bill so people with PTSD from rape and trafficking can get treatment, right?
Senator please do not for this bad healthcare bill which will hurt and possibly kill many people
What about the healthcare bill?
Graham-Cassidy?
Sen Portman is highly principled & refused to work with Obama, whom his leader Donald Trump said was illegitimate.
After the election where the Republicons regained control of Senate, Portman had really offensive ads about "bipartisanship".
Voinovich explained the total opposition to Obama: “If he was for it, we had to be against it.”
My father knew George Voinovich. Today's Republican Party is the radical right. No moderates allowed.
Yes, I didn't agree with many of his policy goals, but I didn't have the visceral hatred that I have for the morally bankrupt like Portman.
