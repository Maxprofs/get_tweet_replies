Congress owes middle class families affordable health care something Cassidy-Graham want to take away.
People are constantly talking about the middle class and not the working poor who have to work just to exist.
Because the 1% needs more $$$ 
Buuuullllllllllsssshhhiiiitttttt! Stop lying! #PhotoOpRob When is the town hall?!?!?!?!
@HammerTime_419 has said it all! We're done here folks
When you cut taxes for the rich, do you really think they're going to use the money to hire more people? Hahaha. #Funny
Build the wall!!
Senator, when has Republican tax policy helped the middle class?  Trickle down economics is a FRAUD.  Stockman disavows it, do you?
Say NO to tax reform until we see trumps taxes!!!  How will HE be benefiting from reform? 
AMERICANS WANT TRANSPARENCY!!
Top 20% in income receive 90% of tax cuts, and it adds $3.6 trillion of debt over 10 years. Idea it's a "middle class cut" is pure fiction.
And healthcare for all
A Representative for over 20 years, and you are just now concerned about us? Or is it that you are worried about your job?
Your ideas have failed America in the past and u r either 2 lazy or 2 stupid to change any of it, so I say NO to tax cuts for millionaires!
No one's fooled by your tax giveaway to the wealthy Stop using middle class families as a cover for your greed and deception
GreedyOldPricks
You really do but instead you love to hand out corporate welfare to millionaires & billionaires that don't need it
It owes it to the little people. You know the ones you don't care about.
No on Graham-Cassidy! Stop trying to steal our healthcare to give the rich a tax cut #ACA #KILLTHEBILL
It isn't businesses, large or small, that drive the economy, but the consumers. When the 99% buy, demand and jobs increase and visa versa.
#noGrahamCassidy
EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE 5 MINUTES TO READ THIS ARTICLE PROVING TRUMP & GOP's ARGUMENTS 4 LOWERING CORP. TAXES ARE LIES!
Yes, you do owe it to small biz & middle class families. SO WHY IS TRUMP & GOP LYING ABOUT THE TAX PLAN? #GOPTaxLies
Only if it forces the 1% to pay their fair share. I'm tired of funding their war machine.
Hi Rob! I agree with corp tax cut to be intrn'lly competitive, but we don't need lower taxes on rich income/dividends... that would hurt
You *OWE* it to your constituents to have a TOWN HALL. So we can tell you what to do with this current attack again on #ACA & other things
Really? Currently US "owes" $20T to lenders. I think middle class families would prefer to have debt paid down, so my kids don't have to.
Close the tax loopholes but now exist and why not tax corporations that have offshore accounts

Close the loopholes. Create a flat tax. Close the loopholes. Close the loopholes. Close the loopholes. Close the loopholes.
No, you owe them affordable health care
None of this matters at all if people can't afford healthcare. #noGrahamCassidy
Raise taxes on the rich and big business. They are the ones who can afford it, yet get largest tax breaks & loopholes.
Your tax reform plans won't help middle class, only pad bank accounts of the wealthy, and further spread divide between 1% and everyone else
2+2 = 3trillion
hmmmm
who are you trying to bs.  Give me specifics not slogans, then we will talk.
You owe it to Ohio voters to be available . Town hall is needed to explain why you plan on voting yes for Graham-Cassidy bill. Fix ACA .
I agree & we also need #TermLimits so creeps like you & your good old boys club don't live off tax payer $$
Voodoo!
As long as it helps only the middle class and small Businesses.  Quit Lying to us.  You are only for Big Business and Wealthy people.
As long as Big Biz and the wealthy don't get a single cent in tax cuts. Raise wealthy and Big Biz taxes to pay for small biz tax cuts
Tax cuts for the rich people! They have no interest in helping small businesses or middle to poor class. Only the rich for them!
You misspelled "destroy Medicare and Social Security so Donald Trump gets another tax cut", Senator.
No tax breaks for the rich.  We need universal health care.  Think of Ohio, not lining your pockets.
Why do you support this??! #Censure #CensureTrump #HR496
Hey, remember when Trump cut funding from the DHS's anti-extremist program, and specifically ended investigation of white supremacists? 
Every Republican Who Signed the Norquist Tax Pledge Violated Their Oath of Office
Warren Buffett: We're moving moving toward a tax cut, not tax reform | TheHill
The 'trickle down theory' is dead wrong http://cnnmon.ie/1LaIuSP  via @CNNMoney
Congressional Budget Office: Trump's budget math overestimated economic growth by $3.4 trillion
Trickle down doesn't work no matter what you call it. We saw what failed GOP policies did to Kansas.
What does Congress owe cancer families Rob? Another assault on pre-existing conditions? Maybe this bill will get a hearing this time.
Tax reform needs to treat small and big biz differently. The best need to work harder to stay best than the upstarts do to find success.
Hey Rob I'm a small business owner in your state and you have no idea what I go through. So please don't talk for me!!!
What line of business are you in? Just out of curiosity.
why won't you stand up to Trump, who is bad for Ohio and bad for our country? a corrupt businessman.
How many jobs did you create with your 7 Benghazi investigations & 50+ Obamacare repeals? Zero.
They say they are Conservatives on Budget,  they end up spending more.  They rip us off, steal our money & tell us it's all good. Bullshit!!
ROB U KNOW YOUR DAYS IN OFFICE IS COMING TO A END IF U DONT GET BEHIND THE POTUS AND GET THE AMERICAN AGENDA PASSED

Congress owes it to #bigbiz in return for doing their bidding at every turn.
