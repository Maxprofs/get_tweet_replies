Yes, terrible crime.  How do you feel about treason or espionage? #impeachTrump
It's important that you and Congress work together and remove Trump and keep Russia out of our Whitehouse!
And our democracy.
Stop basing ur comments from Fox News.
No town halls. Do you read your Twitter comments? Ur president is robbing our democracy.  U R robbing citizens of health care.
Do your job.
This has become a HUGE issue in Columbus in the last three months. Brothels are opening throughout the city with foreign women.
You man the USA government right?
and Presidential fraud and stolen elections
Trafficking is important. Fox News is stupid but I'm sure they like such stories - sex and little girls. But NO BCRA and Trump fam treason!
It is important that we all work together to go after those who commit the heinous act of betraying their constituents. #SaveMedicaid
We've got 1,946 days to figure out how to do this. https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/retirement?iso=20221108T1930&p0=805&msg=Happy+Retirement%2C+Rob+Portman%21&ud=2&font=cursive â€¦ #RepealAndReplaceRob
How's your stance on county run CPS DJFS that ignore a child's numerous disclosures of sexual abuse by her dad.  Tiffin Ohio blames mother.
Do you avoid commenting on issues that your constituents want to hear about because you are afraid?  Party or Country?  Easy choice!

Agree but so is treason. You represent & serve US, NOT the Republican Party. Where is your integrity, Senator?
And the heinous crime of colliding with the Russians and the amoral act of taking people's insurance away.
What about treason? Are you going to go after the people who committed the heinous crime of treason?
You'd be better served to not rely on @FoxNews for ANYTHING.Stop being complicit/you work for the people/the people demand justice!
Agree... and we must all go after those who commit election fraud, and collusion, and treason.
How about those who commit the heinous crime of taking away Ohioans healthcare? Hmmm?
How are they taking away Ohioans healthcare?
Hold a town hall
Haha... like on Facebook? Like he apparently is doing tomorrow? What a joke... he's got his own agenda and does not listen to constituents.
Or election hacking. How about election hacking? How are you going to protect the integrity of our elections going forward Senator?
You are using a tweet on stopping human trafficking to springboard into election hacking. Seems legit
I would question ANY news reporting on any FOX affiliate!
Try to help the people you were elected to protect. The health care sucks . 
also mentally ill man in the president.
...how about the heinous crime of treason?
Those sorts of power crimes are fostered in environments of ogliarchy and corruption in state and leaders.
I hope you stay opposed to BRCA. It is a of crap
How about the crime of Treason?
How about treason?
@GOP Rs in Congress DO YOUR JOB to STOP the destabilization of our country/our lives. Bust @jaredkushner Suspend his SC..#EnoughIsEnough
Your constituents thinks it's important that you not kill them by voting for the evil billionaire-blowing bill that is Trumpcare.
It's patriot vs traitor time
If you side with a regime that colluded with Russia it is the latter.  
Choose your side for the history books!
How about those who commit the heinous crimes of treason and collusion with a foreign power?
Fix the ACA - DO NOT REPEAL THE ACA! Also, investigate Russia attacking our election & prevent any further attacks. Keep sanctions.
Maybe you should look into the woman who reported being raped at 13 by the President. He says he didn't do it, but, then, he's a serial liar
What's your thoughts on collusion and treason?
it is also important that we work together on healthcare
Kind of fascinating (in a bad way) how our elected representatives skirt the obvious issues. Hello, @senrobportman!! Rome is burning, dude!!
Treason is pretty high there too. You could be a hero if you actually confronted it head on rather than looking the other way.
What are your thoughts on Treason, Collusion, Poison waters, Nepotism, incompetence, and money laundering?
Yes, se, trafficking is bad and must be stopped. So what are you doing about it and why promote Fox News since they have 0 credibility?
Really? A link to Fox News? Only the GOP thinks this is a credible news source. Sigh...you show me more & more who you really are.
Right after U vote 4 t new revised HCBILL! That's what we want fr U furst! DoYJob & vote N t new bill. Stop holding things up!!
What about the heinous crime of treason? Espionage? Collusion?  Your silence is deafening. Party of Traitors. Unbelievable your inaction.
And conspiring with Russia to influence elections? How do u feel about that? Anything to say about numerous connections of admin to Russia?
You need to deal with the criminal POTUS first! Let LE deal with human trafficking. U already tried and failed.
Won't matter if we don't have a country. Congress really needs to do something. Soon.
Fox and friends ....
Another #DistractTweet
Lots of important issues you could address, but top of the list now is #TrumpRussia and keeping/improving ACA.
Agreed. Women & their bodies should not be controlled. That being said, maybe rethink your position on reproductive freedom?
What about #Collusion
I'm guessing that you only get your news from Fox. Explains your positions re health care and your continued support for DJT.
Or as @realDonaldTrump calls it, "fake news."
Oh good gawd. Your statement on Trump admin and Russia is coming right up or not?
He never comments.
Colluding with Russia to win an election also bad, right?  Like to hear that from you
Human trafficking is caused by Republican vice laws, dummy.  Unconstitutional immigration laws, drug laws, prostitution laws, etc.
It isMORE important that we all work together to go after those who commit the heinous crime of TREASON by conspiring w/hostile foreign govt
@jonlovett @jonfavs check out this thread
Seriously @jonfavs can u please! We need attention. @AprilDRyan read the thread @TopherSpiro
It's important that you work for the citizens of Ohio & country & vote no on the GOP HC bill & work with all senate members & improve ACA
Until you find out Trump has done it. Then it will be fine.
First, regular reminder NO on Senate Heath Care bill. Fix, don't repeal ACA. Second, your thought on Trump Jr.'s emails and poss. treason?
From the looks of the new bill that's all they are doing. What bill did you look at?
It's important that you do things that you don't tweet about too: saving healthcare for Ohioans, saving our democracy from Putin/Trump.
We need traitors out of DC
Be aware that we are very concerned about all the Russian connections to Trump... Jared needs his security clearance pulled!!
How about the heinous crime of treason?
Agree that this is an important issue, but your lack of leadership on Trump is stunning. You're a coward, and Ohio deserves better.
How about also going after foreign governments that interfere in our elections and collude with Trump @senrobportman
and illegitimate presidents.
