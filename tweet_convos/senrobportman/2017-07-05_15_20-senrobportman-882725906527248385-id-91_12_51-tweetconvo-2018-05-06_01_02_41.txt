Our GOP lead state legislature is another part of the crisis!  Please stand strong  for Medicaid expansion everywhere you can Senator!
All the heroin and opiates being prescribed are coming from Afghanistan.
This is exactly why we need you to vote NO on the AHCA bill.
Our nation is in a moral crisis propagated by the Left which is leading to all of the overdoses. Treat the problem, not the symptom!
If you support #BCRA this is meaningless. Millions will lose care, mental health & addiction services will not be covered. Vote no!
Our NATION is in crisis. You're in a rare position to make a huge, positive difference. Please put lives over party and reject BCRA.
agreed!
Keep the Medicaid expansion. It's more effective.
Our COUNTRY is in CRISIS.
"...freedom and JUSTICE for ALL."
Or, do you subscribe to "...every man for himself."?? BRING BACK OFFSHORE TAX $$
And we will not get them if the nincompoop in the White House has his way. Listen to Ohioans...not trump.
Don't throw our state into an even deeper hole, Mr. Portman. Vote NO on BCRA.

Why do you decline comments as specific as this on other important issues? Don't be bribed by McConnell on 1 issue. NO MEDICAID CUTS
Our country is in a crisis. Do your job. Listen to your constituents. Get your head out of the sand.
Fix the ACA. Vote no on Trumpcare. Better yet, Medicare give us your health care plan or Medicare for all.
And taking away healthcare from people WILL MAKE IT WORSE!!!
#NOTRUMPCARE
That's why we really need a healthcare bill that doesnt gut services for addiction! Thanks 4 standing w struggling Americans. #SaveOurCare
Those people need access to proper AND affordable healthcare for treatment #ProtectOurCare #SaveMedicaidSaveLives
Glad you are invested. Hope you also realize a couple weeks rehab is useless without strong social safety net and follow through
Agreed Senator. Leave Medicaid alone to help manage tbis crisis.
You could have made a huge difference serving on the Senate health bill committee. You blew it, bent over for Mitch.
Our COUNTRY is in CRISIS!
I wish you FOUGHT the WAR on the INCOME DEFENSE INDUSTRY as hard!! NO FED TAXES paid for YEARS! Keep ACA! NoTAXCUT
that's why ACA needs to be PROPERLY financed.
I hope you recognize that a pittance to battle addiction won't replace Medicaid and is not an acceptable compromise.
One of many reasons not to support the Senate Health Care bill. Addiction is your fav topic. Don't forget about all needing care.
Prove you really do care and vote against Trumpcare
No we don't
Fraud.
This is also why you can't support any bill that cuts Medicaid or the expansion. Work to fix the ACA.
And we need to maintain working healthcare plans like the #AHCA and not let pride turn in to avarice towards your constituents
I have not seen any support for Trumpcare. Ohioans do not like it. So your vote has to be NO!
And we need as way tho pay. No cuts to medicare/medicaid.
Keep ACA!
No we
 Don't
BRCA bill allow med. insurance corp. not to cover heart diseases, osteoporosis, diabetes & cancer. I'm sure you know that senator
Then I hope you listen to your constituents and vote no on a healthcare bill that would make opioid treatment inaccessible for many.
And a strong Medicaid and health care program to pay for treatment, right? Right? #SaveMedicaid #ProtectOurCare
Thank you for recognizing this. Work with @SenSherrodBrown on bipartisan health care legislation that matches this statement. #leadtheway
Getting pretty uncreative with the #CARA  shitposting, Tweetaide
And why we need the resources for people to seek treatment like the ACA does.
THEN DON'T VOTE ON TRUMPCARE
Portman hasn't said he is voting no on trumpcare. Don't trust any of these #GOPlyingTraitors to do the right thing. They are #Complicit
Also why we shouldn't cut Medicaid or out essential health benefits at risk
Addiction is a MENTAL ILLNESS under Trumpcare those in need lose access to affordable mental health services! Vote no on Trumpcare!
That is also why you need to vote against Trumpcare!
One reason why we need affordable health care more than tax cuts for the wealthy
And you need to vote no on the BRCA. Recovering addicts need to know they can get medical care no matter who they are. Same as everybody.
Senator as an example of a profile in courage when needs of constituents are at hand look @RepJohnBoccieri he can teach you where to stand
..not to mention chronic illness such as diabetes. Sub tx is only one facet of care, don't let ohio families down 2/2
Say no to acha, don't be bribed w/ opioid $, it won't be enough + addicts have overall higher health costs, hiv, hep c, mh issues 1/2
Why are you tweeting about non-controversial bills from a year ago. Stay current please and vote no on the #GOP assault on cancer patients!
We really need you to oppose the health care  bill.   It does nothing to help this crisis.
Vote no on healthcare legislation that cuts Medicare and coverage for 22 million please.
As u line ur pockets with insurance companies campaign money #hypocrite

Portugal decriminalized drugs 14 years ago – and now hardly anyone dies from overdosing | The Independent
91 Americans die every day from opioid overdose. @SenateGOP repeal bill doesn’t seem to care.
Then please vote no on trumpcare.
There are many programs for drugs. That does not need to be in Medicaid. If you ar Republican vote like one..
Then I will expect you don't take a dollar away from Medicaid.
Please stop with all the talk of overdoses. Start talking about people with disabilities.
And your party wants to pass a horrible bill that will increase the problem.
That's why we need to #FixTheACA!!!
#NoBCRA
#NoCutsNoCaps
#REALTownHallNOW
Then vote no on the AHCA. It is not going to help those in crisis with opioid addiction, children, the poor, with previous conditions. NO
They just need to not use drugs some of us have real conditions we r dealing with
and programs like Medicaid
Very true. Thanks for pointing it out, Senator. But we also need Medicaid. Not SOME Medicaid, all of it. Stay focused.
Given how much & often you tweet about opioid abuse & addiction, I'd think you'd have come up with a better plan for #AHCA
It's why we NEED to keep the protective provisions for pre-existing conditions
And it's why we NEED to maintain Medicaid and Medicare for every Ohioan who falls within current guidelines.
And why we can't take away their lifeline for treatment by stopping the Medicaid expansion @GoBrinkman
I am a constituent. Don't count on Trumpcare to do the job. Don't vote for Trumpcare and maybe we will see an end. People are in despair.
Ohioans also need affordable, comprehensive health insurance.
I thought we had that with ObamaCare? Thats what was claimed and sold to the public.
Who said anything about the ACA? Whatever law is passed needs to strengthen existing coverage not weaken it.
You said comprehensive affordable health insurance, that was supposed to be ACA. Right??
Thank Heavens you're alive Mr Portman. Your constituents have been searching high and low. People have been very worried.
I live in Trumbull County. Please take a stand and fight to improve ACA or establish single payer universal care. Fight for our health.
Don't cut mental health, women's health, and preexisting conditions. You represent all of us, red and blue. Fight for Ohio!!!!!
True. Also why we need ACA and expanded Medicaid. Thank you!
But children and seniors no being able to afford healthcare is fine with you as long as the Koch brothers are happy
That's why we really need affordable healthcare.
That's why you need to keep saying NO to the BCRA and AHCA and NO to cutting Medicare!
It's also why you cannot in good conscience support any partisan healthcare bill that strips insurance from Ohioans.
And we also need comprehensive health care, like every other dev. nation.  Go forward, not back.  VOTE NO on Wealthcare.
Our country is in crisis. Your political party is under the control of a tangerine moron controlled by Putin.
