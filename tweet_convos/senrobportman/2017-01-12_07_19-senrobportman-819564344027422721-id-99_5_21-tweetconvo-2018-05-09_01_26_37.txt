You are going to be literally killing Ohioans who rely on ACA for their healthcare. Hope you can sleep at night.
Please wait for viable plan. Please keep #PreExistingConditions and #Nolifetimelimits #preventive care parts.
Please don't repeal ACA. Avg. premium growth rate is 40% lower than Avg. growth rate over preceding decade.-Kaiser Foundation
Do you really think this legislation will make costs come down? This isn't how corporate greed works. We are so screwed.
You've had 7 yrs to draft a replacement - what exactly have you and the other Republicans been doing for all that time?
As a constituent in Ohio, WE need a plan in place BEFORE you repeal #ACA. #preexistingconditions DEPEND on YOU! #SaveACA
I am asking you to actually think about what you are doing. Don't just swallow the party line. Use your brain.
If you believe there is a time when we must stand before our maker and be held accountable, could you do it?
Could stand before Him and excuse yourself for taking away millions of people's lifelines? Is that what a Christian would do?
I don't think it is and I don't think you do, either. So then what side are you on? Whose side?
.@senrobportman I am a constituent--Toledo 43612. Please postpone repeal until replacement is ready! My vote depends on it #SaveACA
I'm in 45208. Hamilton Co. went blue in 2016. You're lucky Ohio Dems messed up, didn't run PG Sittenfeld. @senrobportman
Maybe our elected representatives should forfeit their health care until the new smart responsible plan is in place.
define quickly as possible? Maybe pretend it's you who is losing insurance.
Instead of wasting time trying to repeal for 7 yrs, why didn't you work to modify ACA or come up with a replacement?
ACA cannot be repealed without better solution.  ACA covers preexisting conditions (like pregnancy!) & students!  Do better!
No you won't. You don't pull the rug out from under millions without having something to  replace it with. Unforgivable.
Will you support pre-existing condition clauses? Yes or no.
How about making health care Non-Profit? The only people benefiting from your legislation are politicians and Healthcare CEOS
The consequences of an ACA appeal would be devastating for many Ohioans. Please consider people over corporate interests.
Will you protect Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid?  Seniors, as we are, depend on their existence.
#MakeAmericaSickAgain
When? What's your timeline? You repealed, but haven't replaced.
Make health care reform about the ppl of this country not about a Rep Party agenda. Dem w/faith in you. #SaveACA
please DONT repeal #ACA without first providing a viable alternative. Losing health care hurts our families!
I heard you were trying to slow the repeal process from @SenWarren team. Please stand up to greed. Thank you.
.@senrobportman Specifics of this plan? I have a pre-existing condition. How does your vote protect the many Americans like me?
I'm appalled & sickened. The rich will continue to get richer, the poor poorer, & the sick sicker or die. You must be proud.
What can YOU do to improve upon the ACA?  How will you get more Ohioans insured?
why haven't you been able to present a decent alternative in 7 years Senator?
Deeply disappointed in you rushing to repeal ACA without a viable replacement. Shame on u. Voters will remember
Shame on you for taking health care insurance away for millions.  What if it were your kid who would die!?
by voting 2 take away insurance from people w preexisting conditions & putting life limits back? Your helping no one!
Just a little bit of the damage you did.
if you were serious about replacing the ACA we would have seen a plan long long ago.  No details after 6 years. Disgraceful
show us the new plan!
if you had something better, why didn't you present the option YEARS ago? You have had many years to present an alternative
Deeply disappointed in you rushing to repeal ACA without a viable replacement. Shame on u. Voters will remember.
.@senrobportman if you're going to offer a plan, it *has* to be in place before you repeal the ACA or millions will be harmed or DIE
- have a new plan ready. You will be judged harshly by history if u repeal & people lose coverage, their houses, their lives
Call it the ACA. Help the clueless people in the back know what you're *really* doing. You should be ashamed.
.@senrobportman Why do you not have such a plan already, Quit riding your bike around the NP and do what you were elected to do or resign.
The majority of Americans do NOT want it replaced! Put country over party, save taxpayers money, & leave it alone! #SaveACA
you've had almost 8 years!!! I will work HARD to get you voted out!!
voted to give millionaires a $49k tax cut. 
#resist 
#ACA #acaworks
ACA repeal gives million-dollar household incomes an avg $49K tax cut - nearly the median income for all households http://cnb.cx/2iKZKDj 
Please don't repeal the ACA. No one should be punished for getting sick! History has its eyes on you, Senator.
reform don't repeal is the smart option.  Please don't make a political statement on be backs of Ohioans who depend on this
Republicans should have listened to Rand Paul, repealing without replacing makes us look foolish.  Libs will love this.
you better or your Name will be MUD in Ohio.
So where's the plan?  GOP has had years to develop plan & has never done so. Now you're going to do it & pass it in weeks?
You don't need to repeal it. You just need to fix the parts that need fixing. Your are going to cause huge economic upheaval.
You've had years to come up with replacement. Don't believe you will. You are just going to endanger Ohioan's health.
None of us trust you, your colleagues, or Tangerine Mini-Hands. Quit lying for PR purposes and tell us the truth.
No repeal without a replacement that improves care.
False. 960,000+ will lose insurance and you have no plan. You embarrass Ohio. You are a partisan hack.
I prefer to #SaveACA, but at least I'm grateful that you'd oppose fellow GOPers who want to repeal without a replacement, @senrobportman
The only people happy to hear about this is the 1%. Their tax cuts are finally coming.
Better yet, don't repeal!
whenever that happens to be..meantime..millions of Americans will get kicked off their insurance #Obamacare
I assume the repeal&replace deal will be modeled strongly after the NC legislature's deal to repeal HB2.
mention that #ACA was funded by taxing the rich. by repealing you're giving yourself a tax cut. your net worth: 6.7 Million.
you say "ObamaCare is increasing costs for middle-class families", now u r raising their taxes #ACA http://pbs.twimg.com/media/C1-z_UqXEAA90Vz.jpg â€¦
the republicans have no plan to replace it and you don't care
Do you know there are 665,900 Ohioans now on ACA???  What are you going to tell those people when they have no health care?
I am the middle class you reference! This new plan needs to protect ACA rules on pre-existing conditions and lifetime caps!!
I will make sure every constituent I know never votes for you again. You are making America SICK again! You've had YEARS!
you did not get a mandate  to replace Healthcare.  Made it so over half of citizens don't get a voice.
do not repeal any aspect of  ACA before having a replacement in place. Cover preexisting conditions and other positives!
Will that plan include coverage protection for pre-existing conditions?
only smart sensible plan is single payer/Medicare for all.
your plan is to #makeamericasickagain
you will be leaving some of your loyal voters out to dry like my dad who relies on the ACA after a stroke 1.5 yr ago.
I will NOT vote to re-elect you if you repeal the ACA without having a plan to replace it first.
why not have a smart, sensible thing plan in place before you repeal it? Political suicide if you ask me. Good luck!
Instead of "as quickly as possible," how about BEFORE repealing? All Americans deserve adequate healthcare!
How many years have you had to come up with a replacement? Ah, yes, SEVEN. #SaveACA
Time and time again you choose party over the people you represent. #SaveACA
If must replace simply because Republicans need to own the healthcare plan, please include pre-existing condition protection. Disappointed.
gee you had 7 yrs.  can't figure it out ,
As quickly as possible? Should have a plan first. Name your victims. You are deciding who lives and who dies. Ashamed in OH.
You had 8 years to come up with a plan. Repealing and running is so wrong. What,no one in ur family needs ACA so u r against
nice work repealing something without offering even a semblance of a plan in advance.
will work? HELLO you are repealing with no replacement.  Peoples lives are at stake here - you are playing a dangerous game
So how long will 30M Americans be in healthcare hell? And will you tell them publically you will do that, and own it?
I cannot take your word on this subject, grandsons life is to important. You have never stood up to your own party. Shame
Not a single detail in your statement about what replacement looks like. What about the 700k Ohioans who now have coverage?
.@senrobportman I think the responsible thing to do is have a plan before repeal. Can't leave millions of Americans on a ledge.
What is the plan? You have had plenty of time.
You should have a detailed plan BEFORE you repeal.
Get to work, now. Lives are at stake.
Very vague, should have worked on replacement before repeal. #CommonSense
