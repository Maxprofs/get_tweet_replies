Didn't you write it?
12 people on the committee, so he wrote some of it. And he is responsible for it, being co author.
Get on board w Repeal/replace now.  You are being unbelievablly bull headed & jeopardizing entire conservative agenda.  = No vote for you
What is the advantage for @senrobportman to support the Repeal/Replace at this point from your view? Will it help his constituents?
Absolutely it will help. Obama is failure. 6.5 million people lost insurance. Friends have O "health card" but can't use bc deductible.
I agree with you here & have a good understanding of Ohio's situation. My concern: Folks dealing w/ Opioid addiction & long-term unemployed
Fix the ACA.  Don't start all over from the beginning. Can we discuss this please?  Town hall?  Isn't the Senate on "vacation" again?
Why not fund opioid programs with tax on big pharma who pushed these highly addictive drugs in the first place?
Great, but as GOP plays games with this, real people live w/daily stress of wondering if they will wake up tomorrow without access to care.
Change goal from "get the votes" to actually improving healthcare - better quality, lower cost, more access. Work with @SenSherrodBrown
We can do much better than the current administration. I can't get over the fact you helped write this bill. You and Mitch are embarassments
BCRA is a joke, same as the House bill. Need to figure out what is not working with ACA, & fix those parts only. No side deals for BCRA Yes!
Repair ACA and Medicaid. Dont rescind taxes on most wealthy.
We certainly can...by embracing the #ACA. Oh, and not letting McConnell bribe you with $45B to vote for unfixable #BCRA.
Holding up health care because of people who choose to abuse drugs?  Don't let the tail wag the dog! Work with @realDonaldTrump
Portman still hiding from Ohio voters! No town hall meeting in Ohio in 2017! Not one meeting!
Don't vote YES on TrumpCare. Under this bill working class/elder Americans earning less than $50K are expected to pay 1/3 for healthcare.
You can do better by being bipartisan and trying to fix what's wrong without removing consumer protections and mandatory services.
NO to Repeal and Replace! Congress is incapable of fairly replacing.
It's called the ACA already passed fix it and quite playing games with the markets. I'm holdin GOP responsible for this mess. You broke it!
Please help to form a bipartisan committee to improve the current #ACA, @senrobportman #hcr
If you vote for this POS bill you will not get re-elected. Fix Obamacare, no need for a repeal and replace, make Obamacare better!
Be  on the right side of history, @senrobportman Leas  bipartisan effort to improve the #ACA
Please prioritize ppl w dev disabilities R our most vulnerable citizens, opioids important, howevr ppl w dev disabls deserve to have servs
Maybe the way to do so is to include some of your democratic collegues.
Abandon repeal and use bi-partisan support to fix ACA.
Work with people who want to improve healthcare. You know the folks across the isle.
Please state that you will preserve healthcare: Medicaid, the expansion and ACA for those of us on it and in future beyond opiod addicts.
Why is your parties revenge against Obama more important than millions of human lives and their healthcare?
Sure we all deserve better, but you will vote with your party.
It's exhausting- all of this - but please just fix the ACA - work across the aisle

Pope called. He says you're a dick.
To defend human life, above all when it is wounded by illness, is a duty of love that God entrusts to all.
You're a fraud Portman.
We really have to do better than BCRA. Our future is at stake.
Lower premiums means nothing when the insurance covers little and has $5000 deductibles.
How come you guys didn't have a plan all ready when you had 7 years to prepare one? Republicans had plenty of repeal votes during Obama term
Didn't you help craft this draft? Confused?
Fix the #ACA. Do not allow your vote to be bought by opioid monies. Do not allow #agetax or preexisting back into law. #SaveOurCare
You had 6 years.....what are you people doing????  Fix what we have or make sure it doesn't fail.  Either way, work for your constituents!!!
I know, right? Say Rob, who wrote that horrible POS anyway? And who only bailed after Mitch decided to put the brakes on?
Will the Republicans Fail the American PPL on Repelling Obama Care! We the ppl are tired of the grid lock in the Republican party! : ( VoteY
I sure hope you don't pass a lousy bill just to toe party lines. Work hard it make it right unlike many of your fellow Rs are not doing.
A good part of the Opioid Addiction & deaths responsibility rests on the money hungry pharmacy companies & their reps. Make them pay.
Tax the pharmacy companies to pay for the Opioid drugs "addiction treatments". They cannot be allowed to profit from this epidemic.
Please stand up for ALL the vulnerable and struggling people of Ohio who will be hurt by this bill, Senator.
You know good Democrats with good ideas for healthcare.  Be a leader.  Work with them.
I thought it all depends on the drug payoff you have in line w Mitch McConnell?
.@senrobportman healthcare is complex and difficult decisions have to be made sometimes. The BCRA is not the answer. Fix the ACA
#RepealObamacare #nogovernmenthealthcare repeal repeal repeal!!!! No federal $$$ 4 Ohio problems. Solve ur own prob #noMedicare 4 addicts
Does your better draft still include lifetime caps?
#BetterCare is not wanted, #BestCare is needed by your vote for # FULLREPEAL ALL OF OBAMACARE, this is our #healthcare, not the gov's
7 yrs Rob ........... how come you are so damn smart on this subject today ???
Former ACA patients to the ER raises my employer sponsored premiums&deductables. Start with insurance cost CAPS & PROFITS then hit drug cost
Don't repeal, improve.
Medical liability ins reform, laws against price-fixing, expediting new drug testing, allowing consumers access to imported meds
So when are you going to do a town hall and go face to face with your constituents?
Where are the GOP MARKET-BASED solutions?? Increase competition, negotiate Medicaid drug prices, out of state insurance plans??
We need a bipartisan bill written in daylight with hearings etc. You must continue to vote NO until it's  a bill that is truly good for OH.
Your statement is complete crap. Opioid addiction is personal responsibility & "health care" bill is insurance bill not actual health care!
Ohio needs and urges you to continue to oppose this horrific bill. Add'l $$ for opiod treatment will not help the rest of us. Vote NO.
Don't accept @SenateGOP bribes! #GOPHealthcareIsMurder Senator, protect vulnerable citizens #PortmanVoteNo on ANY GOP bill! #ProtectOurCare
Opposing the current bill isn't enough! Fix issues of the ACA and MOVE ON! #GOPHealthcareIsMurder #AHCAKills #ProtectOurCare #PortmanVoteNo
Then why didn't you write a better bill?
Listen, there are two options to get people covered affordably: Keep the individual mandate or go to single payer. #preexistingandivote
Much has happened since then. What's new. How about a town hall to listen to constituents.
Well do it then and quit talking. You had 8 years to figure this out. Do your job!
There is point here that hasn't been made. Your current bill will devastate Vets. R's claim to be on their side but legislate against them.
you know how else legislation gets drafted?

in committee
Awesome! Thanks for your public acknowledgement of this. Please continue to advocate for major improvements to this draft!
Set aside party rhetoric and work on improving the ACA. Its structure is solid and its protections save lives.
Don't forget, Portman made over $550k last year, and is in line for a tax cut himself if the BCRA passes. And then there's those donors...
You drafted it!
work with the dems
Premiums would increase and coverage decrease. An additional 1.12million in Ohio would be w/out insurance. None of that is okay.
I'm pretty sure McConnell with bribe Sen Portman with some cash.  Still doesn't help Ohioans.
Vote No! Stand up for Ohioans!
You could come up with a bipartisan plan to fix the ACA, but you have to cater to the special interests and your party.
National Health Care seems so obvious.  Unless your campaign is being funded by Insurance and Pharma.  Health care is not for profit.
Refund the ACA risk corridor and stop scaring off providers. The only new bill needed is for single payer.
Everybody needs health.   Not just addicted folks.   Please support health care for all -- quality healthcare that people can afford
Let Obamacare collapse..
Your party has been moaning about the ACA years. You mean you don't have a replacement ready to go?!? Shocking!
Funny Robbie only balked after it died.  We all know you would have voted for it, had it hit the floor.  #gimmeabreak
So Medicare for all? Vote no on this bill in any form.

POINT 7: CBO lays blame for the insurer exit largely with Trump.   In fact... 12

A stunning pair of charts of the CBO report from my colleague @alv9n

Center for American Progress has broken down the Senate bill's Medicaid losses for vets by state, based on the CBO: http://ampr.gs/2sjDZOO  
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare #BCRA #AHCA #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
This is wild. The tax cuts 400 families get from the BCRA equals the Medicaid expansion for 700,000+ people. https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/26/15862002/tax-cuts-ahca-republican-health-plan â€¦
So hold hearings; invite amendments; fix what's broken on ACA, but do not repeal and do not replace with that horrid bill.
Thank you Senator. Maybe next time do a bill this important out in the light instead of with 12 others in the dark. We'll be watching. #0h02
We've read your statement. When are you going to hold a town hall to discuss with & hear from your constituents? #FixACA
Senator let's have a town hall where we can discuss healthcare solutions people want, specifically ones that rhyme with "shmingle shpayer"
Perfect tweet!
Portman took 350+K from insurance lobbyists. Those execs are the ones fighting so hard against shmingle shpayer.
Why not work with Dems to strengthen ACA in order to help more people with healthcare?
Agree! Work with what we've got and make it better!
But you helped write it!  Why not raise concerns then? Would also be nice to get some women on the committee!!
Birth control is an important part of health care.   And it's also good for the economy.   It is also good for the health of the family
Thank you - please do not fold for opioid $! That will not solve the problem for everyone. Please repair ACA and work for a bi partisan fix
We CAN do better. Stay strong, Senator and don't be bought off. This bill is bad for Ohio, and will remain bad, given forces at play.
Remember, Sens. Paul, Lee, etc want bill to be WORSE. They will get concessions. No concessions YOU can get will make this thing palatable.
Town hall, please .
For 7 years Republicans have been lying about Obama & the #ACA. If you can do better then why haven't you? You're lying now.
So all we get is all talk and no action? When are you going to get our in front of this and propose something? Or have a town hall?
Senator, you helped write the #healthcare draft. It is a bad bill, not a draft. Fix the #ACA do not repeal and replace.
