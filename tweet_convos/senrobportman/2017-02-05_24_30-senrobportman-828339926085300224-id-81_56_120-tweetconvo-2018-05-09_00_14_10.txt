How about Congress working together to stop the insanity in the WH. Your behavior is shameful @CbusIndivisible @OHDems
.@mkvktm and @senrobportman < will vote for DeVos, cuz a stupid #America is a competitive America @CbusIndivisible @OHDems 
#noDevos
Ohio community needs to work together!  Vote no on De vos! No on De vos! No on De vos! No on De vos! #AmericaFirst
Maybe you should start by telling the president that we are not morally equivalent to Russia, @senrobportman. Someone needs to stand up!
FOCUS ON HOME.. PLEASE VOTE NO ON DEVOSS!!!
focus on your own state
The problem is the #SoCalledRepublicanPresident is not that interested in stopping Russia.
They are critical bcos @realDonaldTrump has DONE NOTHING but lower the sanctions on Russia. They should be very mad.
Check out @TomNamako's Tweet: https://twitter.com/TomNamako/status/828680587359744001?s=09 …

And then you have this.....
And you're ok with this?
Here is @POTUS telling troops the media does not want to report terrorist attacks because "they have their reasons, and you understand that" 
Please ensure that the Republican Administration ALSO wants to stop Russian aggression instead of pandering to Putin.
.@senrobportman Who was in charge of congress when Ukraine problems occurred, what did you do about them? Anything but talk?
this statement incorrect. Bannon and trump love russia
Ohio constituent, parent, & concerned citizen here. You're ignoring your voters. Vote no on Devos. #DumpDevos #NoonDeVos
#DumpDevos Would you hire a CPA to perform your surgery? She is NOT qualified to head Edu, either!
you should share this with your boss our #SoCalledPresident

Just like the GOP did with Obama! We won't forget. We are awakened. #resist
Trump says he is 100% sure DEVOS will get in.. the only republicans with BALLS ARE THE WOMEN!

Says. It. All.
Yes, work together… Meanwhile your President is alienating allies with every phone call.
not gonna happen with Mr. Trump. When will you stand up & deny his nominees, investigate Russian connections?
let's work together for Ohio children. Vote NO on deVos.
maybe you work for your constituents and listen to them.  #DumpDevos
Too bad POTUS thinks the US is morally equivalent to Russia. Do you agree with his assessment?
Vote no on Betsy DeVos!
STOP DEVOS AGRESSION!!!
why don't you tell the president that.
!!!!!!!
GOP goes along with trump until its about Russia. All they care about is dick measuring not American people.
hello its a civil war stop backing the nazis in yellow
Then get rid of Steve Bannon. He should not be in NSC.
Were planning on mentioning this to Trump? Not sure if he follows your tweets.
Trump must realize that.
.@senrobportman True. And Russia sanctions must be codified in law. WH is too ready to roll back w/o any concessions from Putin. Shameful.
nothing you say matters while there is still a chance that you could #StopDeVos #SavePublicSchools #Unqualified #noDevos
Who paid you $51,000 to have this opinion?
Like how the Ohio community is working together against DeVos & Co. but you're not listening at all? Pathetic.
Why aren't you concerned about Ohio's Public Education? Vote NO on DeVos!
And they are right!Why is America constantly meddling into other countries affairs?Trying to impose OUR points of views?
stop Russian aggression? Sounds like @potus wants to give him a humanitarian award & invite him over for tea #WakeUpAmerica
they should be #SoCalledPresident is an #embarrassment  Also, vote NO #devos she is a bad for Ohio kids and America
A good education is critical to our youth! Please vote NO on Betsy DeVos! #Ohio #DumpDevos 44224
tomorrow is the day to step up and vote no on DeVos
.@senrobportman #whatever. You'll never stand up to @realDonaldTrump on Russia. How about voting no on DeVos to practice having a #spine?
Then you will have to stand up to Trump.
Working together is a term that so called President has no interest or knowledge. Disavow him!! Vote no Devos.
YOUR so called President is destroying alliances. On your soul Mr.Senator. Face the chaos Repubs have created.
maybe you could listen to your voters? #DumpDevos #standup#moneyspeakslouderthanthepeople
he doesn't care. called 3 times already. Here is his statement.some billionaire will deep pockets is more important
it is so WRONG and party at all costs. Emails, call, tweeted and silence. For the people?
called three times. Left messages. Nothing.
resist Devos
so does this apply to Congress holding @POTUS and @VP accountable for their stance on Russia?
no they are not and our so-called president is putins butt kisser.
just listen to you constituents please and vote no for DeVos
if you have time to tweet about everything else, respond to your constituents...vote no for Devos!
Represent your constituents & vote NO on DeVos.
Maybe you can your colleagues can work together to check your president.
You're right! It's all about working together! That means you'll work with constituents in your Ohio communities, right?
true. But it's President Bannon and his mouthpiece @POTUS you need to convince, not us.
Against Trump. You forgot to add "against Trump".
Keep it up Senator. A few quiet words with Agent Orange might help; that everyone knows what he's up to. You never know.
We see everyone tweeting you...why are you even thinking of voting yes for DeVos.  YOU WORK FOR US!
check his FB page...same thing...he HAS to know how we feel when he votes; sure someone monitors this
First the US domestic community must work together. Stop US domestic aggression.
Stop diverting, the big issue is Trump and his appointees.  I'm from OHIO...you need to hear me and others.  Vote no DeVose!
If this is your belief, then your support of DJT is unconscionable.
vote NO on DeVos!!
Not going to happen until you people in the senate call out the fact the the President is in bed with Russia
And you must work for the good of our children! Dump DeVos!
tell your socalledPOTUS, he is the one trying to kill NATO and the EU
Yeah, great idea. Maybe propose this to @realDonaldTrump. Or you know, just keep up the pre-scheduled robo-Tweets.
vote no on Devos. She's unqualified- from your constituent in 43054 (New Albany, OH)
