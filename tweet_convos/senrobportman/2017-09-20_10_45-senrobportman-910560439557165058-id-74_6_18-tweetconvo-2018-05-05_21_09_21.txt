Omg stop it! We've been calling and asking for a no vote on #GrahamCasiddy! You owe us an answer!

I get that this is your "cause" and a valid one, but please don't ignore the demise of healthcare for millions! Vote NO on GrahamCassidy
Rules have changed. He doesn't get to just focus on his pet projects under Trump. Step it up, Rob.
My aunt just diagnosed with metastatic cancer. #GrahamCassidy could be devastating to her. She's an Ohioan. Can u care about her for a sec?
Thousands of Ohioans want to know you care about their sick loved ones and that you'll protect them. #GrahamCassidy doesn't reassure us.
Whoever is running this account is time deaf. These tweets aren't winning Portman fans. Why can't you understand that? Ohio is more than...
*tone deaf* gd autocorrect
Great. So VOTE NO on the newest Trumpcare that would make people even more vulnerable to being trafficked. STAND UP FOR US!  Oppose this
NEW: Blue Cross on Graham-Cassidy
Yes! Something we can ALL agree on! @RonWyden get on board! Our children thank you! #SESTA Now!
No on #GrahamCassidyBill
Graham-Cassidy allows insurers to NOT cover:
-Pregnancy
-Newborn care
-Mental health services
-Prescription drugs
-Rehab
-Birth control
Got it. Really, we're with you on this one, Senator. Feel free to move on to more pressing matters such as publicly opposing Graham Cassidy.
Vote no on #GrahamCassidyNO
Good job. Now let's talk about health care...
How about a bipartisan effort to work on health care?  #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
Human trafficking, opioids, small business, great. Let’s talk about how will vote on health care. Stop dodging the question, Sen Coward.
The Portman bot is posting again today.
But shame on you for voting for new healthcare bill.  Biggest change to healthcare in over 50 years without CBO or debate.
Vote no on Graham-Cassidy. Don't inflict pain on your fellow Americans.
#GrahamCassidy would cut federal health funding for Ohio by $161 Billion through 2036 according to @CenterOnBudget. #WTF
Great you are working on this. What about healthcare? Please stand up for Ohioans and vote no to gutting ACA.  Ohioans need healthcare.
Great! Now let's see bipartisanship on healthcare!  Vote NO on #GrahamCassidy
Sure wish you were equally obsessed with a bipartisan consensus on healthcare.
Bipartisanship is a great thing. How about trying that with healthcare? Please oppose #GrahamCassidy and explore bipartisan proposals.
“Hey! Instead of doing hard or thoughtful stuff, I’m only talking about policies that literally no one opposes!”

1,058.

"To date, not one major health care industry or advocacy group has expressed support for the Graham-Cassidy plan."

But are you going to vote no on the Graham Cassidy bill. Or do you want those who were trafficked to be burdened by pre existing conditions?
Vote NO on current iteration of Trumpcare
How are you voting on that cruel healthcare bill?
Your support of GrahamCassidy is morally evil
What about Ohioans healthcare and Jobs no one care is there
How about working on bipartisan efforts on healthcare instead of shoving terrible  #GrahamCassidy down everyone's throats?
And those coming out of the sex trade will have no healthcare if Graham-Cassidy passes. Please #VoteNOGrahamCassidy #VoteNo #NoGrahamCassidy
I agree, this is important, but PLEASE, comment on health care! Vote NO on on the #grahamcassidybill ! Stand up for Ohio!

We all know what you did yesterday. It's time to talk about #GrahamCassidy
Great.  Now insist on hearings/bipartisan health care reform.
[chirp] [chirp] [chirp] [chirp] [chirp] [chirp] [chirp] [chirp] [crickets]
Please #noGrahamCassidy We all deserve health care just as good as the healthcare we pay for that you enjoy.  #protectACA #noTrumpcare
The thought of you and @SenCapito voting yes on the #GrahamCassidyBill is sickening.  How does the bill help with the #opioidcrisis ?
Why are you silent on #GrahamCassidy ? If you support this, Ohioans will NOT be SILENT!
Rob, your constituents want you to vote NO! on #CassidyGraham
Seriously.   
Stop.   
Respond.
What about bipartisan support to #FixACA to help all Americans afford access to healthcare? #NOGrahamCassidy
So bipartisan consensus is something you value? Then you can't possibly support Graham-Cassidy.  But you will. B/c you don't listen ever.
When are you going to answer your constituents questions on Healthcare? You certainly aren't answering your phones.
#BuildTheWall #DeportThemAll first step to ending Human Trafficking
Agree.  But first stop the assault on healthcare.
Rubber stamp politics will no longer work during re-election time. Do your job and protect our healthcare. No on #GrahamCassidyDeathBill
Why did @SenateMajLdr squash the bipartisan #ACA bill @SenAlexander and @PattyMurray were working on? NO Graham-Cassidy!
#KeepUsCovered #KeepUsCovered Vote NO #GrahamCassidy
If you like bipartisanship so much why don't you give it a hoot on HC? Just a thought
How about NO on GC?!!! Cmon man. Focus.
#MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
Stunning

Katy Tur: there are no protections for essential health care benefits in Graham-Cassidy…
What's the consensus on making cancer patients go into medical bankruptcy? Is that one bipartisan? Gonna hash that out in committee hearing?
#noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy
bipartisan healthcare would be amazing
Do healthcare in a Bipartisan effort. Gutting Medicaid will cripple Ohio. You was put in office for Ohioans. #GrahamCassidyBill No
We're not distracted by this @senrobportman . We, your constituents, are begging you to vote no on #GrahamCassidy .
What about human suffering in the US if u pass the stupid healthcare bill?
I'm telling you dude people are wanting you to say something about the healthcare then talk about other stuff
what's a hearing?
Too bad there's not bipartisan consensus that sick people shouldn't have to choose between getting well and rent, food, heat, gas, etc.
