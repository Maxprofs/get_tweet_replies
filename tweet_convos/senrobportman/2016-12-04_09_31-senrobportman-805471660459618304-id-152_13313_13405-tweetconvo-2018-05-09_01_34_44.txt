OSU fans should be concerned about how well the offensive line will hold up against a really solid Clemson defensive.
@CFBPlayoff rigged
Call it what u want, go cry, we're still in!
I honestly do not care. If you thought Mich's D was good, wait until you see Bamas. They won't give u
Thats what everyone said in 2014
not the same defense
That defense hasn't been tested yet.
I'll just let them show you how good they areâ€¦
Fair enough and I will say the same.
@CFBPlayoff LETS GO BUCKS BABY!!!!!!!!!'
let's go bucks #BeatClemson
#BeatClemson
#GoBucks beat #Clemson  we got this
#BuckeyeNation
@LemonStealing
this is dope, but still short #SpotGate
@OSUCoachMeyer
the Buckeyes aren't playing for a national championship.....YET. LOL
isn't this the goal though?
Look we understand your sad because 1. You've been beat by OSU AGAIN! 2. You didn't make the CFP. 3. Jabrill Peppers will go to NFL so you..
Make sure you know what you want before you rush out to get it
. Lets go Bucks!
a true National Championship would then be fairly done... The pick this team no that team and then only 4 in a playoff...???
they shouldn't have been in and the score proves that...
#WINNING
@BrianRobiskie let's go Clemson
just wanted this at the top of my timeline again. Please watch and get Fucking hyped
Go Bucks. Beat Clemson. Jt please stay one more year to get more gold pants.... best qb ever.. Peppers spit on our "O" .
lets go get another one for the buckeye state
.@mckeen21 @OhioStateFB I'm a huge Wisconsin fan, but y'all voted for Trump, so can't be too mad at you guys.
I'm close to running through a wall this morning.
the problem of who is number 1 would be fair if all the divisions had representatives of 1st & 2nd place teams.
Go Bucks!
but should be out
who cares we are still in
#BeatOhioState  ....again!  #AllIn
why did you tag Terrelle Pryor? He never faced Clemson in his career lol
shouldn't be, but carry on.. you won't beat Clemson
I love when people make dumb predictions before the game has even started.
still think it was a dumb prediction?? Lol..
we made it boys come on
look game love football

While everyone is arguing, what song is this?
@OSUCoachMeyer
@VictorDiSalvo

@CFBPlayoff  Ten!
Song? #Gobucks
with help from the refs, o lie o state makes the playoff. Go Blue Putos.
It's just so beautiful.
I expected nothing less! #GoBucks
song cred?
OSU didn't win there conference last year but hindsight, everyone knows they would of at least scored on bama unlike sparty.
nice
@OhioState what a Joke!!
@OhioState No way they should be in should have been Penn State cause they beat them and are Big 10 Champs
osu 1 loss, penn state 2, championship game is irrelevant
beat clemson #1
@GHScoachmorgan
It is past time to beat Clemson!!!!!!!!!! Remember the orange Bowl! #BeatClemson

I just ran through my wall, who do I bill?

@TheRealJRSmith You're in thanks to the refs in the Michigan game.
the kicker missed two easy kicks should have never gone to ot
You guys have *killed it* with the videos this year.

@Ramouni_7
@colinthompson84
dec 31st! Fiesta bowl
@sdcarrier24
time to reclaim our trophy
@CFBPlayoff The only thing Clemson has to worry about is the refs. We all know OSU can't win without them. Easy win 4 Clemson
Yea, is that why Vegas opened up with OSU as 3 point favorites?
LMAO

LET'S GOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!! #BuckeyeNation

please wear the correct helmets this new years eve
@RealShaunHall That's what she said.
Good luck in the irrelivant bowl!
thanks. Bud

@DOMTIBERI Better get that offensive line to Buck up and receivers to step up! Clemson defense is scary good.
Only when they show up to actually play
We need Cardale back. He would have a party on the Clemson D.
@OSUCoachMeyer Congrats buckeyes. Hope you beat Clemson. What a season. Just think it was suppose to be a rebuilding year.
@CFBPlayoff sorry don't deserve this. #notaconferencechampion
We accept your apology.  Oh, and the Eagles suck!
I don't apologize for my team beating yours.
LET'S FUCKIN GOOOOOOOOOOO! IT'S ALL OR NOTHING... THE TIME IS NOW TO STAND UP AND REPRESENT TO THE ABSOLUTE FULLEST! #BUCKEYES

@AlSnyder78

congrats!
Florida sucks too!  Man...that was ugly last night!
so was 41-14 we own the state of Ohio
and that was 10 years ago, what has your team done since? #GOBUCKS
I just know we beat OSU in basketball and football whenever we play.
@CFBPlayoff dumb
@OhioState
you dont deserve it you didnt win your conference must be nice to be handed something strickly because you have a sexier name
conference championship game was vs Wisconsin who lost to OSU and UM. Welcome to the big boy club.
@OhioState cant win conference championship but In.... weird...
