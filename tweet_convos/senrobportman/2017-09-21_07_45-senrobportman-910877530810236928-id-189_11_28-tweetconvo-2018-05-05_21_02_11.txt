Just say NO to the Koch Bros! #GrahamCassidySucks!

bipartisan work on a bill that supports healthcare for everyone would be a good way to care for these youth affected by substance abuse
#NOGRHAHAMCASSIDY!!
Sen Portman- Won't be getting my vote if repeal ACA

Time for you to vote against anything that takes away medicaid for millions of families, including those that struggle with drug addiction
W/O healthcare this will be hard. Say no to Graham Cassidy bill.
If you take Medicaid, how the hell would they get help? Shame on you hurting Ohioans.

Then vote "no" on Graham-Cassidy.
How can you vote for this health care BS?
What are you doing, man?

Your constituents deserve to know where you stand on healthcare.

Should people have it or not?

#NoGrahamCassidy
read that he is likely to vote FOR this bill as he did for the other lame efforts of the GOP..even though our Gov is against it...
It's absurd that @senrobportman wont even address the issue with his constituents.
Any hope that this guy has a heart is being eviscerated.
Only if it affect him, remember.
Then don't vote for Graham Cassidy!
How are you going to do that if you vote for Graham-Cassidy?
Single-payer now.

VOTE NO ON GRAHAM-CASSIDY
#noGrahamCassidy
Sen Portman, do you think reducing Medicaid expansion and ACA appeal will fix our Ohio heroin problem????? Might want to rethink it.
We want HEALTHCARE. Vote no #GrahamCassidy
You should also continue working to insure Ohioans have quality healthcare, not the crap pushed by Graham Cassidy, which would hurt Ohioans!
Senator, it's time to stand up for the people of Ohio and vote NO on Cassidy-Graham healthcare bill. It hurts children,old,poor,sick,female!
#VoteNOGrahamCassidy People over profits, vote to help your citizens instead of fatten your war chest! #SinglePayerNow
Yes but who's going to pay for it especially when you repeal and replace. Take a stand Rob
Stop taking money from the pharma lobby. They're killing your constituents with prescription drugs.
Should work on not stripping healthcare programs that pay for substance treatment then, if you want to put your ballot where your mouth is
You  are  bad  at  your  job
.@senrobportman with Graham-Cassidy that will really be difficult. A lot of therapy session are needed to council families w/drug addition.
How about reducing voicemails so your constiuents can leave msgs first? 
Or are you finally admitting Charlie & David are more important?
And we'll need Ohio's residents to have health care coverage to get treatment.
Then vote no on the Cassidy-Graham proposal. Or we will vote No on you.
@elongreen So very accurate!!
Vote no on repeal and replace
So republicans promising Murkowski her state can keep Obamacare if she votes f Graham/Cassidy. Why does she care more bout her state than u?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT THE HEATH CARE BILL? This tweet was meant to distract.
HEALTH CARE

you know addicrs depend on medicaid to get of drugs, don't you?
And vote NO on #GrahamCassidy

AARP: Older Americans to pay $16K more under GOP ObamaCare repeal http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/351703-aarp-older-americans-to-pay-16k-more-under-gop-obamacare-repeal â€¦ #Buckeyes #Ohio #GrahamCassidy #OhioState
Are you going to vote for a healthcare bill without Congress budget office assessment?
Your silence is deafening.  I assume it's your staff who post about anything except about healthcare.  No Buckeye spirit to be found.
...by cutting healthcare resources? Making drug addiction an unaffordable preexisting condition? Heartless
Why are you kicking #Ohio's youth off their parents' health insurance? Why are you dooming them to illness and bankruptcy? #GrahamCassidy
@robportman is voting for millions to DIE, while he lines his pockets! He's a liar to his constituents! VOTE HIM OUT!
You mean by taking away healthcare to line your pockets? How does that work? I'll be waiting! VOTE HIM OUT!
Please vote against the Graham Cassidy bill; would cause much harm to those of us with very sick family members!
You must vote no on this horrible bill if you care about anybody.
Please don't vote for this sham healthcare bill, it will kill thousands, would you want it for your family
Hey, the work to do right NOW is to pledge to help addicts and their kids keep life saving healthcare! Vote NO on G-C! #KillTheBill #Bad4OH
How about you work on repeal and replace the ACA
If you care about treating opioid addiction you vote against Trumpcare
I have been messaging Brown my gratitude. he's such a great Senator.
We can keep emailing him, too. And use Resistbot. Text resist to 50409 and the bot sends YOUR messages to your reps.
Of course, we are lucky enough to have Senator Brown, whom we never have to call, and Gov K has been loudly against.
And hire more people and phone capacity at your office. Especially if we have to go through this BS every couple of months.
No on #GrahamCasiddy if you really care about reducing substance abuse. You know this bill is bad. Do the right thing and vote No.
Not only will you ruin our lives when we lose healthcare, you are ruining them now with all of this worry and panic. Give us our lives back.
Oh, just stop it. What are you going to do about Graham-Cassidy? You know you are upsetting everyone and we have to call you all the time.
Leave my health care alone!!!
Vote no on #GrahamCassidy which will gut $ for opioid treatment
Absolutely. And all Ohioans deserve access to #healthcare. Vote no on Graham-Cassidy. #GrahamCassidy #ProtectOurCare #Ohio #MedicareForAll
Vote no on Graham- Cassidy! No money to combat opioid crisis!
How would "we" do that if they do not have health insurance?  #voteno
Are you sure substance abuse & other essential health benefits are NOT eliminated from healthcare? Need comprehensive affordable coverage
Graham Cassidy won't include $45 billion in additional funding for the opioid crisis. Keep that in mind.
You know what also helps? Affordable access to physical & mental healthcare. Vote NO on #GrahamCassidyBill or hurt those fighting addiction.
And continue to keep pre-exisiting conditions in ACA. Do not vote for Graham-Cassidy bill.
Come on, Senator! Sure this is important but what are you going to do on healthcare? Vote NO on Graham Cassidy
Do you really care about the Opioid epidemic?? If so, did yu know that they are OPPOSING THE GRAHM CASSIDY BILL????
.@senrobportman will vote to hurt OH cause Kochs will give them 400B if he does........
OH will be 1 of the states hurt the worst by Graham/Cassidy bill. Portman intends to vote yes that hurt the state he is suppose to represent
Please do not abuse your constituents and vote against Graham-Cassidy bill.  It hasn't even been scored by the CBO but is said to be worse!
The Graham/Cassidy bill takes away ALL funding for opioid addiction. But way to PRETEND you care
1,059.
AARP just determined that an unwell 60 yr old with an income of $25,000 will have out of pocket costs of more than $16,000 higher under G-C.
So is Medicaid.
Not ending their access to healthcare w/ a reckless bill is a good place to start.
If we don't stop them, who will?
Every senator needs to hear from EVERY constituent!!
How we gonna do that Rob since you keep trying to take away our healthcare?
If you vote for this bill, any work you do to help the addicted will be meaningless! #VoteNOGrahamCassidy The list continues to grow for NO!
"Ohio gets walloped" under #GrahamCassidy ! Call now to tell Sen P NO! 614-469-6774
I've called today, have you?
how about addressing health care and your position on this new bill; seems like you do not listen to your constituents..

If you only read one thing today, let it be this. Savannah is why access to care matters. #NoGrahamCassidyBill https://twitter.com/save_savannah_/status/910572455470780416 â€¦
Please vote NO on #GrahamCassidy so this #autoimmune constituent in 43609 can continue to afford her premiums, medications & labwork.
So you are going to vote "no" for the new health care bill so people with opiate addiction can get treatment, right?
Taking away our healthcare or making it unaffordable will NOT HELP!

Agreed, and one more reason #GrahamCassidy is a terrible deal for Ohio and US. Cuts funding for opioid crisis, mental health, Medicaid, etc.
NO!You can only continue to reduce sub abuse IF YOU VOTE NO ON C/G BILL! All Health Orgs, AARP, GOVS ARE OPPOSED! NO CBO = NO VOTE!
Best done by ensuring Medicaid. Vote no on GrahamCassidy.
Everyone needs to read & retweet what will happen if Graham-Cassidy Passes. If Portman votes yes, children WILL die!
The new GOP health care repeal means premature infants could hit the lifetime cap before even leaving the hospital: http://bit.ly/2f5SotS 
They will die or parents will be faced with financial suicide to keep their children breathing.
Let's start by voting no for Graham Cassidy to preserve Medicaid.
Are you going to Tweet your position on the Healthcare Bill or just hope we go away and not notice?
How about working on a bipartisan healthcare bill that doesnâ€™t punish the most vulnerable and rewards the wealthy VOTE NO on Graham-Cassidy
I'd truly like to have a  to  w/ whomever runs this account. Phones busy, vm full and not a word about #GrahamCassidy. Wth? Come on, man!
It's the Portman bot 2000
My father is schizophrenic with a heart condition in OH. This hits home. Do the right thing. Vote no on G/C healthcare.
That would be hard to do with Graham-Cassidy bill on the table. What are you even doing?
Stay true to pledge to help Ohioans. C-G takes money away from Ohio to give to states that didn't expand Medicare.
Yes! Letâ€™s continue this program! Letâ€™s also continue letting folks have ACA! This GC bill is ! Bad for people. Bad for the economy!
The BilI. Reconsider your support. Read it, It is trickery. It is not affordable, It's not what Trump promised when he campaigned.
True! Yes! Which is why it would be unconscionable to gut Medicaid! #GrahamCassidySucks! Vote NO on this cruel and heartless bill!
We must also continue to provide health care coverage to help those with substance abuse problems recover. #VoteNo #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
Taking away health care maybe isn't the most direct route here.
Why are you not discussing your thoughts on how you are going to vote on healthcare?
I can't believe you care about this Opioid issue  if you vote for this healthcare bill that will eventually kill Medicaid as we know it
Can you vote NO on the Graham Cassidy bill so I can keep my insurance at a CF patient?  My life depends on it.  I'm a constituent at 44256.
@senrobportman you need to vote NO and preserve ACA and Medicaid
G-C will decimate Medicaid. You can't be for helping OH through opioid crisis and vote for G-C. Doesn't work. Nonsense. #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
All the grants can't take the place of healthcare coverage. Mental health and preexisting conditions are out with G-C. #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
How do propose that & cut Medicaid at the same time?  #SinglePayer NOW!
Why do you tweet on and on? But yet nothing about healthcare. I guess we all know where you stand.  Anyone know the date of last townhall?
Really ? Well GC GENOCIDE BILL STOPS assistance! And guts CARE for Women! STOP the carnage & VOTE NO
Your office is not answering phone Senator. You have your mind made up? Koch Brothers won't give the @GOP 400 million if ACA not repealed?
Or maybe the Mercers?
ROB PORTMAN:  Will kill you for Koch cash

ROB PORTMAN LIES: Graham-Cassidy contains ZERO funding for #opioidcrisis.
None of your field offices are answering the phone OR THE MAILBOX IS FULL. Vote NO ON GRAHAM-CASSIDY
You need to talk healthcare thats thats what you're constituents have been asking about constantly  but again u choose to ignore us
If you vote for Graham-Cassidy, the substance abuse will increase with no way to treat it. Vote NO on #GrahamCasiddy

Working hard to avoid discussing #GrahamCassidy? You serve OHIO, not the GOP; vote no.

The last thing anyone wants to tell a sick child is "we can't afford to see a doctor." #GrahamCassidySucks  #ThursdayThoughts
MILLIONAIRE @senrobportman wants to GUT Ohio healthcare funding by $161 BILLION, so he & his BILLIONAIRE donors can get MASSIVE TAX CUTS!!!
Not gutting Medicaid would be a great way to help with that. Vote no on the Graham-Cassidy bill.
#MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
Stunning

Katy Tur: there are no protections for essential health care benefits in Graham-Cassidyâ€¦
Whilst voting yes to the Graham Cassidy amendment to repeal the ACA?
If you truly are committed to staving off this opium epidemic you need to passionately stand against this new G-C healthcare bill.
You must vote NO on Graham Cassidy. You know it's horrible for your constituents.
Guess what? Those w/addiction issues need healthcare too, and many of those rely on Medicaid. #VoteNOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidyDeathBill
Guess that means you do still do care about opiod crisis and will be voting no on draconian republican g-c bill...
Does the new healthcare bill, give money for opioid crisis?  NO
You cannot both be concerned about this  issue  and vote to decrease access to health care
Amen!
What would help more would be to CONTINUE FUNDING FOR TREATMENT. 
You need to OPPOSE the Graham-Cassidy bill that ends Mcaid
Hope you're planning on voting against repeal. If not, this tweet is just a lie.
We can't afford to give everyone Medicaid when we can't afford our Obamacare premiums. People don't consider the ones going broke to pay
Who is this?!?!?! It damn sure isn't #PhotoOpRob! Is this Russia...or big pharma...or his dumbass staff?!?! Really...who is this?!?!?!
But when they are impoverished & desperate w/o health care & mental health care, they r more vulnerable to substance abuse! Vote NO on G-C
In what specific ways is your drug-free program 'helping'?
It's a shame all of the money needed to help people with substance abuse has been removed with Graham-Cassidy. So much for you caring. Shame

GOP leaders put $45b for opioids in their 1st Ocare repeal bill. Now itâ€™s gone
Thoughts?
The Portman bot doesn't have the capabilities of thought.
Wall St-backed politicians push for-profit solutions, opioid crisis gets deadlier & more profitable:
WHO OWNS YOU?
Then let's not destroy Medicaid, eh? NO on #GrahamCassidy!
Medicaid helps, too. Why are you voting against it #whereareyour principles
Jail the dealers. Police are not doing enough. The consequences for dealing are not severe enough.
Will Graham-Cassidy bill cover the healthcare of recovering addicts? How can you in conscience vote for it?!
With @robportman, it's not about conscience, it's about who has enough money to purchase his vote. #FollowtheMoney
anti illegal drugs stop! anti poverty focus.
Substance abuse & drug use will continue and will rise when people are self-diagnosing due to not having accessible & affordable healthcare.
So true. Street drugs don't require a Dx or an Rx!
...And demonizing opioids & patients who need them (since so many actually DO need them) leads to heroine seeking.
