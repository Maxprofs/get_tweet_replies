tax reform and full repeal of Obamacare needed STAT!
ACA has already saved 125,000 lives. If the Republicon plan is implemented, in 2018 15 million will lose insurance causing 20,000 to die.
TRUTH about "22 Million Will Lose Healthcare under GOP": Its actually a CBO estimate of those who will CHOOSE not to buy Coverage
Please read this article
But will they have affordable healthcare? Will any of Us? Please vote no on the Senate "health care" bill.
So basically after letting 10,000's of Americans die because you've taken their health insurance, you'll let more die by reducing safety.
Mr Portman, I live in Warren Ohio and have had no luck contacting any of your office phone numbers. What's the best way to reach you?
Lol he NEVER picks up the phone! I fax him instead.
Portman=GOP YES MAN
great, now do something to protect our healthcare--vote no
Vote no on the healthcare bill Rob
Senator we must hear from you that you are voting no to Trumpcare. #standforohio
You know what would be nice? A relief for the tax on independent contractors.
But not being able to get basic healthcare is fine? Trumpcare targets the most vulnerable to give the 1% a tax cut
Which regulations are you attacking and why? The people you will affect deserve to know.
Your constituents want to hear what you have to say about the AHCA. Will you be taking healthcare away from 22 millions Americans?
Please protect #Ohio #SmallBiz and workers by voting #NoAHCA
Some say regulations, others call them protections...
What about the people who need Medicaid to survive? Can we get some relief for them?? #youworkforus #doyourjob #VoteNoAHCA
What's good for workers - and the elderly- and children - and addicts - and new mothers? Real access to healthcare #voteno
If you want to get better wages, raise the minimum
We are literally in constant anxiety over whether or not you'll #StandWithOhio and oppose the crappy HC bill.
#speakup
#whatareyoudoing
#NO
Portman is master of talking abt stupid crap at most inopportune times. Surprised he's not tweeting abt baseball & skyline chili right now.
NYT has article about dereg's role in Grenfell tower fire. Regulations are good for the public and the price of doing business.
More good paying jobs, less welfare!!
Where do you stand on that absolutely ridiculous health care plan?? Why so quiet? You afraid of Trump? He can't vote against u but we can..
Actually, no, you can't. None of us can… but we can start fighting for the option to, so that politicians can see we've finally caught on.
Please check your facts, Senator. "There is, in fact, little evidence that regulations kill jobs." http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-epas-dangerous-anti-regulatory-policies …
What about our climate?  Have you not learned from the past about deregulation?
.@senrobportman Sound like prioritizing corporate profits over public protection
It won't matter if ppl don't have health care. How are u going to vote? YOU promised NOT to cut Medicaid!  YOU MUST VOTE NO! #PortmanVoteNo
Dem "Regulations"=bad; GOP "regulatory reliefs"=good  Got it! @All100Senators
Where are you on health care?Silence says "yes." That would be an abomination of responsibility.Will you vote w/constituents or against us.
Small business owners and workers need #Healthcare! The #GOPhealthcare plan will literally kill Ohioans. That can't be good for #smallbiz.
How about voting no on that healthcare bill and helping out Ohioans all across the board do the right thing Portman
A living minimum wage?  Not very Republican of you
Give @realDonaldTrump more power over the SEC?? That's crazy. #TrumpRussiaCollusion
This bill gives the President power over independent agencies? Therefore they would no longer be independent. BAD IDEA
That is good.  What about Healthcare?  Where do you stand on that?  That will affect all Ohioans!
Healthcare affects dems & repubs. Why not let both dems & repubs decide it? Work together. Find a bipartisan solution everyone can accept.
I don't totally trust you to have our best interests at heart -- I hope you do.   Higher wages are good though
Regulatory relief? What is that specifically? How does it raise wages and help workers?
If you really want to help small business owners, as well as, you know, other deserving human beings, you'll vote No on Trumpcare.
Please vote against the AHCA. Your voters will be harmed by it and we WILL remember come next election-time! Those of us still alive....
Is this you ignoring the CBOs report on the Senate Healthcare plan? Your constituents want to hear that you're voting "No".
Regulations help keep people healthy, and we may need all the help we can get after Thursday....
Sick people make "bad" employees.  Just sayin'.
1 million jobs lost for you and the 1 precent to have a tax cut. And you hide and refuse to have town halls else your getting a check
What about the Ohio healthcare jobs that would be cut with BCRA?
This does nothing to raise wages. Vote no on the healthcare bill.
What about the citizens of Ohio when you doing something for us 5 plus rate hikes for seniors  Seniors threw to the street out of rest homes
How many hearings will this regulation-cutting bill get? More than the bill that cuts healthcare from 22 million citizens?
Health care why won't you respond
Regulatory relief for maybe 10% of our state that will probably impact 100% of us. Regulations actually protect the public. But you do you

1/ I haven’t tweeted much about healthcare because it’s a painful subject for me. But it’s important, so let me tell you my story 
Glad to see u working but ANSWER your constituents and vote NO on that health-death bill
Still no comment on the Senate health "care" bill? What are you going to do? VOTE NO. The bill is terrible for Ohio and the country.
Jobs are important, but you can't get a job if you're dying
Please let us know your thoughts on #Trumpcare. Thanks in advance, your constituent.
Who gives a hoot. The only important thing you'll do this week is doom Trumpcare

Are Murkowski, Portman or Capito gonna tell us their thoughts on the bill they have to vote on in 48 hours that changes American healthcare?

I need to talk about this for a minute. And I need you to listen, okay?

I didn't volunteer to write this piece because it is too emotional. https://twitter.com/Shareblue/status/879490309624926209 …
SAY NO TO THE GOP DEATH BILL!!!
