The Coalition to Stop Opioid Overdose @StopOpioidOD opposes #GrahamCassidy. What about you, senator? Where is your concern now? #KillTheBill
Senator, please define "adequate and affordable." #iamapreexistingcondition  #GrahamCassidy
Do you really care about the Opioid epidemic?? If so, did you know that they are OPPOSING THE #GRAHAMCASSIDY BILL???? #opioidcrisis

We need comprehensive solutions.
That's right! Maybe you can live with the impossible numbers coming out of Graham-Cassidy Mr. PORTMAN, but an obscene number of ppl can't.
Vote no on #GrahamCassidy
Grants, really our healthcare is coming down to the mercy of grants? Determined by whom?
MILLIONAIRE @senrobportman wants to GUT Ohio healthcare funding by $161 BILLION, so he & his BILLIONAIRE donors can get MASSIVE TAX CUTS!!!

If you want to know how great the #GrahamCassidy bill is for states, the bribe for Alaska is that THEY GET TO KEEP OBAMACARE!!
So is this what you're getting in exchange for killing more Ohioans than these grants will help by voting yes on #GrahamCassidyDeathBill?

Interesting how the guy who wants to reduce the debt touts receiving money from the debt.
Can we talk healthcare now?
Grants mean nothing when millions of Americans lose their healthcare. #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
Then vote no on #GrahamCassidy. As an Ohio drug court judge I know that cutting medicaid won't help fight the #opioidcrisis.
Opioid addiction is a pre-existing condition. You're going to rob the addicts you claim to care so much about of much needed healthcare.
Excuse my language, but HOW THE F do you reconcile your supposed concern over the opioid  crisis with your support of G-C?
But are you going to vote to let our state kill thousands by denying them access to affordable healthcare?
