Tax reform is fine. Please just remember that when America was "great" in the past, the rich paid more of their fair share. #taxreform
Sorry, no. The rate was much higher but no one who actually had money paid that rate. There were many loopholes to protect them from that.
Do you really mean to state that no wealthy person (zero?) paid higher taxes in the 1950s than they do today? If so, you'd be incorrect.
And many of those "corporations" are LLP's or S corps where the profit flows thru to the owner who then pays the individual rate on it.
Not sure how that relates to your points or mine. I'm advocating higher rates on very rich to reduce econ disparity and increase revenues.
Most "rich" folks reinvest their money which is a net benefit. When I hear "fair share" I wonder, fair according to who?
You should just admit to your constituents that you lied to them about wanting to do anything about Obamacare and call it a day.
Why does the GOP keep saying this? Unemployment is quite low, especially compared to where it was when President Obama took office.
Trump has bragged about how many jobs have been created since he Jan. 20, yet there hasn't been any change in tax laws. How did it happen?
Job creation in a capitalist society has nothing to do with taxes. When there is demand, you increase supply. When people have $ to spend...
...it increases demand. Let's work to improve the pay structure so people can earn a living wage. That's what drives the economy.
Hmm: jobs and wages? Setting up more corporate welfare I see. Any room for middle class tax reform?  Reasonable corp taxes without loops????
We do want tax reform, right after you Repeal repeal Repeal obama care
We urgently need to repeal Obamacare!!!  Like you, yourself, voted for in 2015.
You promised to repeal. You are a RINO and a liar if you don't repeal! Don't commit political suicide! Redeem your integrity- repeal!
Support DACA and legislation to protect DACA kids and TPS
Tax Reform is important. Stop #TrumpCare which harms he disabled and move to tax.
Let's start with corporate welfare where multi-billion dollar businesses don't pay a living wage so taxpayers must supplement their workers.
Nice point and so true
I've been saying this for a long time
You know that doesn't work
Tax reform meaning increase the taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals.  Don't forget our infrastructure needs funding.
Explain, please, because if you mean tax cuts for the ultra wealthy, been there, done that-- it does not work.
We need tax cuts not reform.
Quit lying to us you don't support repealing Obamacare which would have been a huge tax cut. Time to repeal and replace you!
Rob wants to give rich folk the relief they need!
Then repeal Obamacare or just keep being a lying politician. You damn well know that is where tax reform will start. #lyingpolitician
No. We desperately need a solid healthcare plan that benefits all Americans. Super wealthy don't need more tax cuts. Trickle down bad plan.
#JustRepeal
Trickle down economic does not work
"TRICKLE DOWN" is a DEAD HORSE.
So yesterday. So greedy. So Walmart. So,THINK TANK.
EVERY COUNTRY TAXES FOR HEALTHCARE.
NO TAX CUT 
YES ACA
There a chance you guys take a look at the crooked ass in the Executive branch any time soon?!
No, we urgently need for you to vote FOR the repeal of Obamacare.  You know, like you did when you were looking to get votes!!  Disgusting!
You can't even do healthcare. You are a fake Republican who needs to be voted OUT!
You are becoming a joke.
We have basically full employment. What does your tax plan look like?
Lots of people are paying attention now days. You guys who continue doing a poor job for the tax paying citizens, are gonna get fired!!
We urgently need you to keep your promise and vote like you did when you knew it would be vetoed. #RepealObamacare
Really? That is completely obvious that the working class has to pull the weight tax wise with these tax breaks. That's a big pile sir!!!!!
No to trickle down.
NO TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You've sold out on us. It's been nice having you as our honorable senator. We hope the next one listens to our cries.
few years ago, Romania simplified & consolidated it's tax code.
nobody paid less but the costs of filing dropped saving citizens money
How about we start with REPEALING OBAMACARE. WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM???????
Earth to Portman- trickle down doesn't work
Sorry senator but trickle down economics didn't work in the 80's, it didn't work 15 years ago, and it won't work now. Fix the ACA first!!!
If low supply (a 4.9% unemployment rate) doesn't get employers to boost wages, then companies certainly don't deserve a tax cut!
Gutting health care for tax $ benefits for 1% is cruel & unnecessary hardship 4 Americans. Red & rural States 2 lose hospitals jobs medicaid
No. we need to get rid of the Obamacare mandate.
Trickle. Down. Economics. Don't. Work. 

"Comprehensive tax reform" it's my favorite euphemism for screwing the poor
Yes and higher wages means more tax revenue for single payer. Win/win
So start a WPA program to employ Americans to fix airports, bridges, electrical grids.
And by "Tax Reform" you mean big tax breaks for the super rich?  No thanks.
We URGENTLY need you to #RepealNow !!  It may not be perfect, but it's better than the horrendous mess we're in!
Maybe we could find a constitutional way to find our schools?
Why you rich folk need to keep more of your money while you keep wages the same?  There is proof this is how it works.
Keep telling us what we need Rob.  It's really moving the needle.
Less taxes on rich does not create jobs. Trickle down doesn't work, it's been proven many times over!
@senrobportman first we need you to have some integrity and vote Yes on a straight repeal of Obamacare. Freedom first, jobs second.
Contact your senators instead of ours! Ohio is not Texas!
Yeah, because they don't take my @gop or @RNC money. Don't worry we're cing for our refund.
When are you going to start caring about hard working middle class and poor workers in Ohio You shameless in tx break for the 1 precent
We urgently need Obamacare repeal....you will screw middle class tax cuts too
you don't work for the presdent you work for those that sent you.. do the right thing

We asked Ohioans, and the majority agree: we cannot cut Medicaid! Tell @robportman to vote #ForOurPatients! https://cards.twitter.com/cards/18ce54ddo5i/4hjcf …
What a joke?  You should join democrat party you at so found of Medicaid expansion.
Tax Reform....or Tax Cuts for the rich?
We need tax rate reductions without regard to the bogus CBO scoring. Get to work.
your not going to vote for a bill that has 12% approval rating because a president with a 36% approval rateing told you so are you?
how about working on ridding the code of loopholes that only benefit the wealthy?  That's a start.
Show us some examples of how changing our tax code would improve the economy. You don't have any, you liar. Becuz this is only for the rich.
Let me guess, the rich will get tons of tax breaks! Close the loopholes that Trump exploits for a start! #taxreform
You are so full of crap. No good businessperson would take a tax windfall and waste it by increasing wages or hiring more people.
Yeah, make rich guys pay taxes
Stealing people's healthcare is not the way to give tax cuts to top 1%. If u repeal ACA Ohioans will die & you/Trump will own it.
Same shit, different day, Rob.
We urgently need a Congress who will toss a crook out of the White House.
Any comments regarding ACLU's statement sent to your office regarding S.720? "Such a penalty a direct violation of the First Amendment"
20% flat tax, $10K direct HC deduction
Trickle down economics does not work. Benefits the rich and screws the rest of us. Esp since GOP hiring anti union. SMH
Boost wages by raising the minimum wage back to a living wage. Only give tax breaks to companies that pay all workers a living wage.
Giving tax cuts to the very wealthy will not help anything.  We are in debt. Now is not the time for tax cuts for rich people.
Your right, we need tax cuts across the board. But that does mean those who pay the most will see the most significant reduction.
The tax cuts aren't across the board.  They are only for the rich.
Just make it fair. Just make it feasible. Just make it free of falsehoods. Just make it!
It's sad that you refuse to listen to the public outcry of your constituents. Only the rich want "tax reform".
$900k+ per wealthy American vs $40 per working-class American does not create jobs & boost wages; it causes a recession. #TaxReform
Every time I hear a republican say "tax reform" the wealthy get a huge break and we get like 40.00. I have yet to see these so called jobs.
Does "homeless" count as a job?
Don't say homeless, try "recycling specialist with outdoor survivalist qualifications. Nothing too nice for the poor" per GOP standards.
You went from cutting a million healthcare jobs with #trumpcare to tax reform? Still planning to give billionaires a cut?
We urgently need a bipartisan solution to improve ACA that keeps ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS & protects Am. w/preexisting cond
You have moved on to tax cuts for corporations, but the rest of us want to know what is happening with healthcare. GOP won't let it go yet.
Uh Huh 
You make $13 a hour and every 2 weeks get slapped by taxes, see how you would feel. Companies want to pay less for more work.
We need you to vote to repeal ObamaCare so people can work more than 29 hours and so businesses can hire more people.
Get back to work and repeal Obamacare!
No!  We need repeal Obamacare.
You mean like a giant tax cut to the top 1% like your healthcare bill. Good luck; word on the street is tax reform will be even harder
No to Trumptax! Would eliminate deductions for head of household & earned income credit hurting low & middle income families
Some of the "simplifications" that have been bandied about serve the wealthiest Americans mostly.  That means cuts for stuff WE need.
As long as it doesn't funnel money to the top - a strong middle class makes a strong nation
How does one build wealth for the middle without building wealth for the top?
WTF?  Why can't we boycott Israel if want? They should quit stealing the land and homes of the Palestinians.  https://theintercept.com/2017/07/19/u-s-lawmakers-seek-to-criminally-outlaw-support-for-boycott-campaign-against-israel/ …
@SenCapito So now U want to waffle out of repeal - It's time to retire or switch parties-U will be the hit parade for 2018-2020 elections.
We need healthcare repealed and replaced too! Do your job and what you promised and voted for when you were lying to us!

Police Chief Probst (Star City): Medicaid cuts will force West Virginians to wait for opioid treatment. “That’s not going to help anybody” 
minimum wage service jobs are not needed.  We need a strong middle class and both parties have given us crap.
Yes, we need people to open more businesses, which creates both.
What kind of businesses?  Majority of mom and pop pay workers min wage.  Unions once great now protect the crap worker.
There's a sizable boom in injection molded plastics right now.
Microbreweries. IT firms. Webhoasting.
not as easy as you make it out to be.
The idea is to create more jobs by creating more businesses, create more businesses by reducing the cost of entry.
This is a tried and true method for eccenomic growth.

I can only assume you'll want to raise taxes to fund obamacare. Until you act on your words they will mean nothing
What does that mean for the poor and the middle class Senator - giving your party's reputation in this regard?
The poor moving up to the middle class, and the middle class moving to the rich.
What is your guarantee that giving corporations tax breaks will lead to LASTING jobs for folks in Ohio?
History.
History of "trickle down" is it sucked for average Americans. Corps drop jobs at first sign of trouble, & keep low tax rates. LASTING jobs.
The biggest eccenomic growth in us history sucked?
Growth is not a bad thing, but almost all of the benefits of that growth went to the 1%. We don't need failed policies from the '80's.
No it didn't. The percentage of the population worth over $1m went up substantially, it was a net benefit for every rung.
