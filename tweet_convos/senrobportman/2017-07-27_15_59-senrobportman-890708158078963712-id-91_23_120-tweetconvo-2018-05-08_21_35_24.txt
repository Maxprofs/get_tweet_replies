My priorities to counter Russian propaganda & disinfo are included in the bill & send a clear signal that their actions have consequences.
Russia is a conspiracy theory you nut.
Pleased that a majority of the #Senate actually cares about #America and didn't vote on the #SkinnyRepeal this morning.
This is a great start
Now when are you going to hold the men in the White House accountable for their aggressive and destabilizing behavior?
I agree with this vote. Thank you.
Who's holding @realDonaldTrump and the GOP responsible for "aggressive and destabilizing behavior"??!! You're ruining our country!
We are going to hold you accountable for your vote on health care
We plan to hold you responsible for your failure to represent the citizens of Ohio!
You are not a Republican.  Resign.
If we are to stop the Russians from interfering with our democratic elections, you must root out Putin's ally in the WH.
Jack says hi.
Pls hold Congress accountable 4poor Healthcare. We arent lesser people than Congress, Wealthy or Insur Companies. We need ACA fixed. #voteno
And we will hold you responsible if the ACA is taken away. Do something good for Ohio, vote NO!!!!  Fix the ACA.
Thank you. Now please do the right thing for thousands of us in Ohio who need the health care we have with #ACA. #VOTENO
And who holds Senators accountable who vote against their base and with socialists? Oh that's right...US! #goodbye #RepealObamacare -IN FULL
Good, but what about the US destabilizing other countries for decades and decades?
Freakin' Enough! I'm tired of you tweeting every 5 minutes to toot your own horn while ignoring our pleas for #healthcare!
Your orange emperor-boss isn't going to like y'all saying mean things about his adopted country. 
What about Saudi Arabia? Or do you guys accept too much money from them to hold them accountable?
How about holding your crazy president responsible?    How about being responsible and keeping health care for Americans?
You're pleased? Oh, well tickle me pink! So glad we don't have a #HealthCareVote going on that's life or death for your constituents. #ACA
We willl be pleased to vote you out of office for robbing 16 million Americans of their health insurance
I'm grateful for your position on this. I hope you will also work to hold the U.S. president accountable for his destabilizing behavior.
No "Reset Button" for you!!!
Now vote no on the "skinny repeal." You want to protect us? Make sure NONE of us lose health insurance.
How can you plan to rob thousands of Ohioans of healthcare and act like everything's normal?
Vote no on tonight's healthcare plan. Just a play to get something passed. No assurance you can stop a bad bill down the road. Now the time!
Stop it! Pay attention to your people. Vote NO on "skinny."
Hilarious while America invades every other Country 
Easy does it. Young lives are not bargaining chips.
What about hold @POTUS accountable for his aggressive behavior?

Didn't think so.
But will the president stand with the congress?
Your attempts at compensating for your distructive votes by sending out these little feel good messages is getting pathetic
I'd prefer to hold you accountable for your aggressive and destabilizing behavior, Baby Killer!
But not your own President???? What happens Senator when there's a crisis, not this shit show drama we live everyday, but a real crisis????
What about holding the WH accountable for their aggressive and destabilizing behavior???

#payattention
Well done. Please vote no on skinny repeal and work to fix ACA.
Ohioans would like you to take a nanosecond and focus on their healthcare, Senator. Why are you voting to take it away?
Wish someone would do the same to @GOP so we wouldn't have to choose between food and health coverage.
What about out President's destabilizing behavior?
Thank you for being somewhat responsible!
You just screwed your President, and he will remember. He made promises to his surrogate father, and he's obliged to deliver. Learn to obey
We will hold you accountable for being a #fakeconservative and a #fakerepublican
Good, but don't fold on healthcare. 43209
Thank you Mr Portman for voting YES on this one
HOW MUCH YOU WANT TO BET @realDonaldTrump tries to veto this bill?
Now we the people will.hild YOU accountable for your treasonous behavior
Trump administration should be proud that they are so ridiculous, MSM can't stop laughing at them .
I would be pleased if you actually voted consistent with what your constituents want . No skinny repeal, or whatever BS you are calling it
OMG-The WH sounds like crazy town more and more. Please put country before party and people before money. There's no sanity, no leadership.
who will hold the US accountable for all the countries we have destroyed in recent years?
So bipartisan efforts can produce results.
...and Regular Order really can work.
Gee Wizz & Go Figure!
You don't deflect well rob
Problem is that more sanctions = more time for North Korea & Iran to further develop their nuke programs.  What's wrong with the gov't? #WW3
Now vote NO on health bill.
Going to hold you accountable for not repealing ocare
I'm pleased the US Senate is dedicated to safeguarding our access to affordable and obtainable health care OH WAIT NEVER MIND
So you want to start a Cold War too? And irritate your entire country by taking healthcare and causing mass bankruptcies while you're at it?
I can't wait to knock on doors to get you booted out of office. Will be my first time. Thanks for the motivation. #coward #killthebill
Please know that if this healthcare bill passes Republicans own it not Ohioans.
We aren't pleased that you are recklessly voting for a bill you haven't read and don't want to become law. This process is an embarrassment.
Ohioans will fight what you are doing with every breath. Not just because we want healthcare, but because we want leadership we can trust.
You get NO PRAISE HERE FOR DOING SOMETHING, KEEP YOUR PROMISE REPEAL & REPLACE OBAMACARE, WHERE IS MY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE?
your no vote is a no vote for you.  good luck on re-election. go back to school to learn the US Constitution.
I'm surprised you didn't vote no. If it's vetoed, what will you do? Change your mind?
healthcare
From here on out, I'll just consider it a minor miracle when GOP does something that's actually good for this country.   HALLELUJAH
TRumpa has to veto Russia sanctions or Russia will snitch on Trumps bad behavior
Now if we could do something about Rob Portman's destabilizing, destructive and terrorist behavior.
With your background on Ukraine, you need to demonstrate serious dismay about POTUS & Russia.  He's more attached to Putin than Sessions.
MULTIMILLIONAIRE @senrobportman plans to STEAL healthcare from MILLIONS of Americans to give MASSIVE TAX CUTS to the RICH!!!
Yes, good job.  Now #SaveACA and you'll be doing great.  NO SKINNY APPEAL!!!  Help Ohioans!!!!

We find no evidence of the individual market collapsing. Rather, insurers on track to have best year since ACA began http://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/individual-insurance-market-performance-in-early-2017/ … 
Market isn't collapsing but the PEOPLE who pay are! My premiums have almost tripled since ACA. We pay $28K/year for insurance+subsidize ACA.
Why are you ok with hurting our most vulnerable communities? #NoCutsToMedicaid #SaveOurCare #BCRAp #SinglePayer
These graphs make pretty clear that BCRA does NOT provide access to health care for those with low incomes: https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2017/07/20/how-bcra-2-0-would-impact-enrollee-costs-according-to-your-age-and-income/ … 
They were covered pre-ACA with Medicaid.
Yea we know you believe yourself. If you want anyone else to put any confidence in your claims you'll need SMEs.

Glad it's working for those not subsidizing it. I watched my RN daughter train for 3-wks to upgrade systems/regs for Ocare. Cost a fortune.

It seems fitting that, with the #TrumpCare debate raging, I got this bill in the mail today from Ethan's most recent open heart surgery. 
You can't distract us from your disastrous #Trumpcare support. Many of your constituents will suffer because of your stupid, cruel vote.
That's good. Will be more pleased if you don't destroy the health industry.

6- What could you possibly negotiate @robportman that would be worth making health care much more expensive for everyone? 
But it's okay when the US and the CIA does it.
Taking away healthcare from millions of Americans is aggressive destabilizing behavior
Not nearly enough.  Everyday Americans can't sleep at night bc of the Trump administration.  Republicans are complicit by standing silent.
