We appreciate the hard work of so many to help secure the release of our @OhioState student’s wife detained in NY http://ow.ly/k4UA308sNoe 
wish you'd consider a stronger rebuke of the ban & detentions.
@OhioState Please do more than offer thanks. Resist the Trump agenda.
Now do you job and stop Trump before he ruins this country!
.@senrobportman thank you for standing up against the EO ban. Please delay votes on Tillerson and Sessions until they can be recalled
Thank you for the clarity and independence of your stand re EO on immigration.  @OSUPrezDrake @OhioState
Detained not for violating laws, but for their beliefs. Unlawful detention. Inhuman treatment.
Tell that to the scholars, researchers & university faculty members who are leaving the U.S. because of these miserable tactics.
.@senrobportman Can you point me to your public statement about the detentions and this EO?
Second. Go on the record and save your soul. Your silence is, well, cowardly.
Trump is burning the Republican Party into ashes. Stand on your own. America was not built on fear but courage.
Please state whether you are for or against this ban. Ohioans have a right to know.
issued a statement.
But didn't say unequivocally he opposes. AND I don't trust that it is 90 day ban.
Sort of like G.W. Bush's "temporary" tax cuts for the wealthy, right?
@OhioState thank you Senator Portman for standing up for refugees and immigrants.
Senator you need to stand firm: No more confirmations until Bannon is gone. The senate has the leverage to do this.
I couldn't agree more. So far this president & his cabinet are un-American loose cannons. Stand up to them.
@OhioState Please act to end this. #nomuslimban
thanks for fighting for immigrants and refugees
@OhioState thank you now is Ohio State going to denounce this ban. Andrea are you ready to fight trump
@OhioState It should never have gotten to this place
Stand up. Do the right thing. We will stand with you in Ohio and beyond.
this is horrific. Rob, you need to actually stand up to Steve Bannon and stop towing the party line.
please stand up to @realDonaldTrump #letthemin
THANK YOU IN AMERICAS NAME!!!
Hope this means you will both denounce this EO as the absolute betrayal of American values that it is.
Great, now let's impeach #PresidentBannon. No white supremacist should be in the WH, let alone writing immigration policy.
@OhioState I support my president.
@OhioState Take a stand Portman. Show some strength.
Your PRESIDENT Your RESPONSIBILITY- YOU REPUBS WANTED THIS- #RESIST #StopPresidentBanon #NoBanNoWall #IMPEACHTRUMP
@OhioState what about the Cleveland Clinic doctor wrongfully deported?  What are you doing for her?
What about those detained in other states will @ohiostate fight these policies?
What about everyone else? What about those who are still being turned away by the ban? Do we ONLY care about our neighbors?
@OhioState we'll see what you do tomorrow morning mr portman
You have a higher probability of being killed in a car accident than being killed by a refugee(1 in 4Billion)
get them all released. #NoBanNoWall
Rob Portman is the Republicans Bowe Bergdahl. Deserter and Rat.
: What are you going to do to lessen the damage of this mess in DC? Tweeting does not count. cc: @OSUPrezDrake
maybe now Rep. leaders and representatives will oppose this agenda... /@OSUPrezDrake
You were tweeting about baseball yesterday... You need to lead, not cower.
I have never seen such hypocrisy. Obama bans immigrants from Iraq in 2011and no one says a word. #Americaslost
.@mmeblannin .@senrobportman Hope you will show similar leadership in protecting Ohio citizens and humans. #lead #HumanCrisis
.@senrobportman you and Republicans in Congress can fix this mess. Why hasn’t you? cc @OSUPrezDrake
Ohio in not AFRAID and we're going to act like it.  Mr Portman gets +1 from me today.
you are losing the moderate Republicans real fast.  This first week is a disaster and it's only getting worse w/ Betsy Devos
@OhioState great! Now work to end the ban, and don't confirm the rabidly anti-refugee Sessions.
Let's import terrorists so we can blame the gun when they wipe out LGBTs!
@OhioState   Let's remember that many more need justice and freedom too.
your actions now will define how history judges you during the American fascist crisis. Do the right thing #RESISTANCE
@OhioState make a statement - take a stand. Ohio needs you now
Drake? Really? Like thanks from an Imam?
This should not have happened to begin with.I blame you and your lack of courage to stand up. COWARD
Been there. Females and children were shooting at USA troops too. Are you a GOP turncoat? A Kasich follower?
Nice pic with the Veterans. So sad so many are in peril when you and your friends (Brown) protect the enemy.
American Christian Movement says, "Let ISIS stay in middle east." Those who want them in USA, live next to them
Where is your public statement condemning the detentions and EO?
Turncoat. MEMO: Trump won. Pass it on to Kasich too. If leaders(?) want, let the future ISIS move in by you.
@OhioState @SenSherrodBrown 
Should never have happened - Sen. Portman, clearly denounce this EO #NoBanNoWall
@OhioState you need to get Trump out of the White House. This is insane
Tell us where you stand on the #Muslimban please.
.@senrobportman Does this mean you oppose the unconstitutional #MuslimBan? #NoBanNoWall
What, if anything is being done to get legal US residents that are stranded in the Muslim banned countries out
@OhioState take a stand Rob!!! You helped one. What about the state, country and world. #spineless #Invisible
thank you senator!
@OhioState "Us?"
Sentator, its time to lead. Speak up for American values #NoBanNoWall. No confirmations till Bannon is gone
grow a spine! Impeach Trump!
@OhioState great job all! @senrobportman please keep fighting for banning the executive order
don't parse, it's a Muslim ban. When a bill is introduced to overturn this travesty vote Yes. #indivisiblecolumbusdistrict12
good to hear Senator. Now how do we put an end to this unjust executive order? We, the voters of Ohio, are depending on you.
and the rest of the ppl bound for Ohio????
Happy for her and thanks for your help. Now fix this mess!
Then stop supporting such blatant discrimination, Mr. Portman!
And thank you!
Good work! @senrobportman @OSUPrezDrake There's still a few thousand caught in this net around the globe, don't quit yet.
lol really Senator? Talk to the man leading your party who put all this into affect
This is a drop in the ocean, Senator. The whole of this EO is unconstitutional and repugnant. Stand up!
@OhioState Grateful she was released. No one should be caught up in this mess.
