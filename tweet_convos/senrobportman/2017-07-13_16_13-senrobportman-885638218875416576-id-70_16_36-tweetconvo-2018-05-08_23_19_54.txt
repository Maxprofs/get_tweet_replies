Please vote NO on this atrocious healthcare bill. We need a bipartisan effort to forge a solution to fix the ACA. Our lives depend on it.
Explain this to constituents who lose insurance, are priced out bc of pre-existing conditions, or get subprime #trumpcare w skimpy coverage.
Please work with Dems to make ACA better. #BCRA will take health care away from your constituents & financially burden them & your state.
Take a good look at foster care industry. There's children that are in the sex trafficking trade. Foster children are easy targets.

As Maine goes, so goes the nation. Stand with Collins on Health Care
1/2 My pre-ACA insurance didn't cover maternity w $636/mon in premiums. I paid $25k to have my little girl. Obamacare would have cost $250.
2/2 49% of women rely on Medicaid to cover maternity. What will they do? 

And millions will die, for a ultra-wealthy tax cut.

Vote no.
Basic human decency over party loyalty.  It's no

@senrobportman you must vote NO on the health bill. Ohioans won't forget your vote. Do what's best of us!
Think you've beaten this horse to a pulp, Robert. Would like to hear you man up and speak up on the Trump Russia scandal.
Amazingly, the new health care bill has an EXEMPTION for Congress' healthcare!!!

That alone is enough to force a NO vote!!!
This is good work Senator. Now, turn your attention to announcing NO vote on cruel wealthcare bill.  Or will you have blood on your hands?
I appreciate your work to stop the exploitation of women. But how can you continue to support our President who disparages women constantly?
Portman will be held accountable if he does not vote no for the #BRCA. Also insert #Trump for #Backpage.
I agree 100%. On another note, you know who else must be held accountable? Trump, Pence, Manafort, DT Junior, Kushner, Flynn, Sessions...

Thx @senrobportman @clairecmc @SenBlumenthal @SenJohnMcCain @SenatorHeitkamp @JohnCornyn for leading Senate in thinking about #Section230
Take care of Americans
wants to take healthcare from MILLIONS of working Americans to give TAX CUTS to the RICH (including himself)!!!
