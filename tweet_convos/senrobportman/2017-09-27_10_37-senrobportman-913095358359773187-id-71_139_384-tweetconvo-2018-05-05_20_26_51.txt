Thank you, @senrobportman ! #PuertoRicoRelief
#Ohio
Don't understand why this needs to be discussed. Americans are dying. Relief efforts should be there by now, not discussed.

Go talk to Trump about the Jones Act. Repubs have the house/senate/White House.  DO SOMETHING NOW!  These are Americans and they are dying.
More?? Nothing close to what they need, us being done for them!! Trump visiting is NOT what they need. It will be disruptive and about him!
@senrobportman is a clown.
#liftthejonesact #TrumpHelpPuertoRicoNow 
Glad for your concern. Get Jones Act waiver for #PuertoRico
Is that Daisy Duke from the Dukes of Hazard??
DON'T TALK.  A C T !!!
We saved post war Berlin, we can save the American citizens in Puerto Rico.
You supported Graham-Cassidy so this rings insincere.
One time he takes a stand on something.puertorico!!!!
Remember yesterday when @senrobportman expressed grave concern about Puerto Rico, tweeted twice about it, and moved on? Problem solved.
More must be done to help our fellow citizens in #PuertoRico. I discussed the relief effort w/ @DHSgov Acting Secretary Duke: 
The GOP has failed the people of Puerto Rico.
Finally
AND do it much faster!
They need man power. How do people get their if they cannot drive & will not have accommodation & supplies for themselves let alone others?
What about US Virgin Islands? They are American citizens also. So disheartening to see the disparity between the US mainland and US islands
Bring those who are most vulnerable to continental US until the island is safe.
Waive the Jones Act!
all places all affected area is in need of help after disaster happen help us help all.
Keep talking, why bother to actually act.
Agree. What is taking so long?
Puerto Ricans voted for Clinton, so this payback time. Don't fuck with Trump.
This is horrific. You support him.
Trump *explicitly* says he's not allowing more aid ships into Puerto Rico because he's siding with industry. https://twitter.com/rebeccaballhaus/status/913088395286597633 …
You discussed! You're disgusting! Took your jacket off but didn't roll up your sleeves! Quit riding your bike & go to PR & deliver water!
The entire west side of the island has been forgotten! There are airports there to get the help to that area ! Why is nothing happening?help
Are you lying through your teeth again like when you told us you would repeal Obamacare?  Your word is garbage.
Put a military commander in charge of the relief effort, as was done for Katrina. 18th Airborne Corps has assets needed to support PR
Thanks Senator.........they need help today.
@robportman is an @OceanChampions So is Susan Collins. Sign of a good human being.
#TrumpHelpPuertoRicoNOW
Does HUD have any responsibilities for helping rebuild the island? Just wondering as they are another dept not heard from.
Before you posture to the negative why dont you discuss what we ARE do I g because it a lot with more going
No shit. Tell Trump they're US citizens. Not just the "bad hombres" on an island in a big big ocean
#Repeat2016Election
Nice of you to prevent constituents from accessing your office.
Thanks!
thats great but what about Lake Erie ?? The Maumee river in Toledo is running slime green ... Hey you remember where Toledo is don't you ???
Sir, with all due respect, now is not the time for more discussion. It is now time to take ACTION. Americans... babies & grandparents dying.
Sorry, the House Republicans went to billionaire camp today, so they can't help on Puerto Rico.  They need to work on tax cuts for the rich.
AMAZING that TRUMP would go sell that...and forget about Puerto Rico...Blows what is left of my mind.
There are a large number of Puerto Rican's in Cuyahoga and Lorain Counties...who vote!!
Quit talking and take action!
Send some naval ships with supplies
Keep going!  Jones Act was waived for TX, why not PR?  POTUS treats PR like non-citizens.  Destruction there looks like Katrina.  Shameful.
Senator Portman is good at two things: ignoring consituents and virtue signaling.
Thank you for asking these questions. Please request the Jones Act be voided to allow necessary goods to get thru more easily.
It is totally unconscionable that @realDonaldTrump has refused to suspend the Jones Act in this time of crisis.
You're useless.
Genocide is happening  in Puerto Rico over skin color It is disgusting
#TrumpHelpPuertoRicoNOW  SUSPEND & REPEAL THE JONES ACT. GET USNS COMFORT & USNS LINCOLN THERE NOW! BOOTS ON THE GROUND! STOP PETTY RED TAPE
Waive the Jones Act, despite what 45 says about the shipping industry's wants. Lives are more important.
“More.”  Great. Specifics? What are YOU doing to get help to them?
Start with waving the Jones act
The president that was going to get rid of regulations but yet the Jones act is standing in the way to getting help to American's
YES by all means.  Start by having the Jones act waived for #PuertoRico
go around @POTUS and revoke the Jones Act
Thank you for staying on this, Senator. And don't forget about the USVI.
Don't discuss. Act.  Now.
