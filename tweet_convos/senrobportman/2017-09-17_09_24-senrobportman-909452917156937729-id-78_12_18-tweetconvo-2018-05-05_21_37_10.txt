Unaffordable healthcare and lack of addiction treatment is what is tearing the fabric of society apart. Come out against #GrahamCassidy
@POTUS affects the fabric of our society. Until you get that through your thick skull everything you try to do will fail He conned you.
Yet Third Reich-style propaganda of @CNN doesn't bother you? Or the IC leaking, surveilling & manufacturing false information? #RealCrimes
The only 3rd Reich style propaganda going on is the propaganda YOU and your fellow Trumpies fell for.
Enjoy being spoon-fed by the CIA & their corporate proxies. #ClintonBodyCount #ShadowGovernment #PodestaEmails #SpiritCooking #DWS #SethRich
Oh, really? Then why is Wall Street against Trump and the anti-globalist movement? Same multinationals against Brexit. #EducateYourself
*laughs* Wall Street is in the WH.....educate YOURself....

the #GrahamCassidyBill will kill many opioid addicts, so you don't have to worry about them anymore
.@SenRobPortman I don't want higher premiums & worse care. Protect care for Ohioans like me #VoteNo #GrahamCassidy
So repeal ACA and how does that help?
Why are you voting on a bill that would take away healthcare that would help fight opioids ?
And your answer is to cut iff treatment options? #KilltheBill
Then why is the GOP continuing to try to take Medicaid away from those who need it!
Prioritize! Not saying legislation you support isn't important but it's back burner compared to health care. Vote NO. Save our healthcare
Please vote no on Graham/Cassidy.It will be especially awful for 50-64 year olds.Keep the individual and employer mandates.
#NoGrahamCassidy
Then #VoteNOGrahamCassidy  because it will cut money your state badly needs
It's why Medicaid is needed. #KillTheBill
PLEASE do not vote to cut Medicaid! Portage County is suffering and will only deal with more! #killthebill
Even though I feel you don't listen or have our backs...I will keep tweeting and calling for you to vote No on the ACA!! #notrumpcare
If possible pls call as well. They keep tally of all calls & voicemails
Healthcare helps don't sell us out. We will remember.
Need funding for diversion and treatment of opiate addicts not health care cuts to fund tax cuts. Impacting 1/6 economy this way is wrong!
With all due respect @senrobportman - the #OpioidCrisis is the embodiment of why you cannot and should not support #GrahamCassidy
If you care maybe stop trying to take healthcare away from your constituents. It's not that hard.
Stop grandstanding on this issue. We know where you stand every time you vote to gut Medicaid.
If you truly understand how the #opioidcrisis affects the fabric of our society, how could you possibly support repeal of the ACA?
Street drugs will be the only drugs we will be able to afford.
It's also why Medicaid expansion is needed.
If you tweet your concern about #opiodcrisis but vote for #GrahamCassidy, YOU are a joke.
vote NO on this most recent outrageous healthcare bill or I'll absolutely vote NO for you.
Graham/Cassidy will make the opioid problem worse. Please vote NO on Graham/Cassidy.
#NoGrahamCassidy
You should vote NO on #GrahamCassidy then since gutting Medicaid will only make this worse.
Don't forget that addicts need help for recovery.
Then don't vote to gut medicaid
Then vote NO on any bill to gut Medicaid!! 45211
Vote NO on ACA repeal!  Gutting healthcare is the WRONG answer!
#GrahamCassidy bill will GUT Medicaid. For Christ's sake pls vote no on this bill
Vote no on Graham-Cassidy or shut up your hypocrisy
Whats needed is YOUR PUBLIC commit 2 support 2 FIX & NOT repeal AFFORDABLE healthcare so thousands of UR voters can b treated.#CantWait2Vote
Why would you support Graham-Cassidy? Are you afraid of missing out on Koch money? Or are you a total hypocrite?
Just stop with your fake concern.
Vote no. No. No. No.
No TRUMPCARE and no rush to kill us.
Right, Senator. You also need to vote a big juicy NO on the ACA Repeal. That is if you really do care about "the fabric of our society".

Stop trying to trash health care and Medicaid hypocrite
You tweet endlessly abt this issue then vote 2 destroy the best path 2 treatment. If you vote 4the Graham Cassidy bill you lose credibility
That's also why you must NOT vote to gut Medicaid. Otherwise you're talking out of both sides of your mouth
Then vote #NO on the latest #ACA repeal!
You can't have it both ways, you can't vote to repeal ACA that covers opioids addiction and then complain about the crisis .
Then don't vote for your buddy Grahams bill--it GUTS MEDICAID.
The best way to fight this crisis is not to vote for a bill that guts healthcare for 30 million Americans #voteno
So this means you'll vote no on the new version of trumpcare? Otherwise you're just talking our of your ass and don't really care.
Keep and fix #ACA or Universal Healthcare.  Helps addicts get the help they need. Prevents others from despair over healthcare coverage loss
Oh, and #neverkasich
Um, it's already against the law...
Until you vote for #GrahamCassidy like you did "skinny repeal" and erase all treatment making the crisis even worse!
You going to vote to deprive Ohio of 2.5 billion by taking away Medicaid from 850K Ohioans?
Not as much as taking healthcare away from Ohioans Rob! Try and have our backs for once this week!
When is the town hall #PhotoOpRob? You want to take these peoples healthcare away...when is the town hall? Vote NO on #GrahamCassidy bill!
Hey Portman how are we supposed to do anything about the #opioidcrisis when you're busy trying to take away healthcare?
Better yet, tell irresponsible individuals to stop taking those drugs. China, cartels, drug dealers, doctors, not responsible, addicts are!
You know what really effects the fabric of our society; lack of immigration/border controls, economy, taxes, infrastructure, Congress, etc.
We need to fight this epidemic together! This is a problem that effects everyone! We need #STOPAct
OUR HIGH PRICES ON DRUGS SUSIDIZES DRUGS FOR REST OF THE WORLD!
That's CRAZY!
Unless, PHARMA is buying and paying for yyour support..
Yup...
Keep Republicans from stripping healthcare from the addicts u so diligently claim to advocate for.
What if they're already here?
With Trumpcare more will die. No treatment- unaffordable in pools. Not just them but all preexisting. Genocidecare . So pathetic and amoral
Health care access is also important- support Kasich and a bipartisan solution
You are wasting your time and our money, senator. You must stop the DEMAND!
Things aren't going to change until pharmecutical lobbyists aren't allowed in Washington. Attacking doctors for not giving pain med is bs
How about attacking the pharmecutical companies instead of addicts and doctors?
#stopGrahamCassidy health care plan no CBO score, doesn't cover for most vulnerable poor, elderly, disabled, pre-existing, pregnant
Vote No! 
BUILD THE WALL YOU SELLOUT RINO!!
The Attorney General that you voted to confirm pursues policies to treat drug abuse as a criminal problem, would lock these people up.
#Afghanistan
Ohio's worst-in-the nation opioid crisis helped Rob win re-election so he could vote to deny healthcare to Ohioans.
#censure #CensureTrump  #HR496
This was quite a segment from @CNN that will be shared far and wide 
You've already offered these people a tax cut. What more do they want?!
