Sir, your vote yesterday was awful. You keep talking cara and opioid addiction like that makes your vote ok. It's not. Vote no! Fix ACA.
Vote no on trumpcare all bills
AARP deeply disappointed in Senate vote to on bad health care bill. Will inform 38 million members how their Senators voted - accountable.
Try to remember that there are a ton of us out here who aren't addicts but still deserve good, affordable healthcare!!
Nothing you say now means anything. Do yourself a favor and retire now.
My daughter is a mental health counselor, in school loan debt, she & her clients need Medicaid to survive, no grants, need health insurance
Mine just got a masters in counseling and is considering Home Depot as a more practical job.
Such a modest man tell the s more
Think of how many you & the GOP will hurt when you cut Medicare.  Work for affordable, single pay insurance for all. #UniversalHealthCare
While supporting the sham that is the repeal of the ACA? Taking and giving away at the same time @senrobportman? #VoteNo
Please hold a town hall so your voters can talk to you.
I saw your face live as protesters yelled "kill the bill, don't kill me." You KNOW this is wrong.
You know what really helps with treatment and recovery? Health insurance. Taking away their healthcare will make the problem worse.
Totally given up trying to be a moderate voice? Now you are guns forward for @SenateMajLdr in his attempt to strip Americans of healthcare.
How do we get through to you, Senator? These grants are good, but Ohioans need more. Keep #Medicaid expansion. Fix the ACA. Make #Ohio proud
Do you have approx $400,000.00?
Hold a real town hall instead of photo ops - 
Good to see Marion County taking debt money under the guise of your bill, Baby Killer!

I am sorry I helped vote You in and I promise you will never get another vote again after today's Senate vote was a no
Toot your own horn @senrobportman while taking away insurance from millions. You are a shame to Ohio. #SaveACA
PORTMAN READ THIS
Stop trying to fool us, you slimeball. You've just finished voting to kill thousands and strip healthcare from millions.
Grants=unpredictable. A consistent insurance coverage is better, but you don't think anyone who isn't healthy or wealthy should be covered.
You know what would save more lives?  Working in a bipartisan way to support and improve the ACA.
#NoTrumpCare
While ripping health coverage away from millions of children, ensuring they have almost zero chance in life.
Trump is a TREASONOUS TRADER 
aline yourself with him and you are him
You voted to take healthcare away from millions yesterday. You have zero credibility.
Would have helped them more if you hadn't voted on Tuesday to destroy Medicaid.
How about saving lives by voting no to senate or house health care bills or any inferior repeal or replace bill.
Great #CARA is great but, again Senator, all is null if you vote for a #healthcare bill that kills #Medicaid (now or in the future)
Hope they don't ever need Medicaid funds!
But have you held a town hall to hear your constituents' opinions on healthcare? You've hidden from us, Senator.
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #BCRA #AHCA #StopTrumpCare #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
6- What could you possibly negotiate @robportman that would be worth making health care much more expensive for everyone? 
You saving lives? 
Town hall to discuss healthcare with us anytime soon?
Now be responsible and help these people keep their access to ACA Healthcare Insurance. Drug addiction is deemed a preexisting condition.
You are off point. You do not want to fund any federal health care. Just say that!
Save lives until $ runs out #DFUNDINGMEDICADE #TRUMPCARE 
By massively cutting funding for treatment?
That's untrue. Your vote yesterday put people in jeopardy and on the brink of physical and fiscal disaster. I wish I had your health plan.
Don't trust this man to help you!!!  He will act concerned and then sell you out.
.@senrobportman & his GOP comrades passed #CARA with $0.00 in funding.... ZIP, ZILCH, NADA!!! #ConManRob #Hypocrite #AllTalkNoAction
Do you have the courage to resist KOCH $ and stand w/ MILLIONS of Americans who will experience death, bankruptcy, and woe if you don't?

"Rather go to jail than die without Medicaid." Portman's Ohio office health care protests lead to 15 arrests - CNN https://apple.news/A-xXjv6tGQ2C_KvN3s3f8Lw …

PATHOLOGICAL LIAR @senrobportman wants to STEAL coverage from 200,000 Ohioans a yr receiving AOD treatment through Medicaid!!!

I urge you to listen to this to understand why people support trump... It doesn't include you. Things change
200 billion isn't enough to justify gutting medicaid. These are POISON PILLS to the social safety net & healthcare for many.  VOTE NO!
#voteno
Constituent 44074. There is more at risk in Ohio! There are other vulnerable populations here! We need broad financing to address concerns.
The skinny on "skinny repeal" is that it screws us just as much as other  GOP plans.  DON'T SELL US OUT for an inadequate concession.
Hmmmm... have you heard from any constituents asking you to keep the #ACA and vote against the horrific #BCRA, per chance?
If you continue to vote for these horrible health care bill, you are not helping to save lives. VOTE NO on these bills.
Instead of grants, which are not consistent funding, perhaps they can have consistent, affordable insurance coverage. Just a thought.
Why don't you engage with cancer patients, Medicaid recipients, and decent Ohioans who want answers on healthcare in the same way Rob?
Why should I care about anyone's lives? #Trumpcare

THE WORLD IS WATCHING! YOU ARE FAILING YOUR CONSTITUENTS, @senrobportman !

@NOFAindivisible , @maddow…
How about have a town hall & hear from all your constituents? You're just like Trump - only care about your base.

#StayLoud & #StopTrumpcare. Call @SenateGOP: 844-432-0883 & keep calling. 

This fight isn't over. #StayLoud & demand @senrobportman #ProtectOurCare & #StopTrumpcare: 844-432-0883 #KillTheBill
