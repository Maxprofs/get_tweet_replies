Fighting to overcome voting to confirm Betsy DeVos. If nobody has health coverage they won't care about lake Erie.
How about fighting to protect the Republic and getting the Russian agent out of the WH?
Health Care Senator.
I can't trust what you tweet because I see what you do.
Fraud.
Please fight to protect US! The people! You can do both - Please, begging for your No Vote today. There is another option- bipartisan fix.
Cannot believe you really choose to ignore your constituents! Vote no on #trumpdoesntcare about our health care!
Fight to protect us....VOTE NO ON ALL OF TRUMPS RIDICULOUS  IDEAS
Please fight to fix ACA NOT REPEAL/REPLACE. America is tired of the rhetoric and lies, and will die w/o ACA.
Constituent from 44106. I expect you to protect Ohioans interests tomorrow by voting #NO
This is your 7th tweet today & despite your constituents tweeting back about health care you are silent on the issue! Stop ignoring us!
Silence =  Complicit = Guilt
No conscience. No character.
Passive-aggressive Rob Portman.
Protect Lake Erie, but not our health care?
YOU'RE PUTTING YOUR BANK ACCOUNT B4 THE INTERESTS OF OH.  YOUR VOTE HAS BEEN BOUGHT OFF THRU SLUSH FUND $. UR A CRIMINAL
Really? You're tweeting about saving Lake Erie? What about saving our health care from your party's disastrous bill?
Praying that you are also fighting to save our health care.  Vote NO on Trumpcare- all versions. People will die without health care
Please fight to keep equal affordable access to quality healthcare. No trumpcare, only # ideas and legislation that's smart. #win for all
Fight to repeal and replace Obamacare please.
Words don't mean anything, actions do. Your actions do not show that you give a damn about Lake Erie.
But you installed the head of the EPA who wants to get rid of this. How does your brain not explode from how often it contradicts itself?
You better vote to repeal or your career is done. We have dozens and dozens of foot soldiers who are ready to remove you in next cycle.
Great article. Can't wait for the sequel: "Fighting to Save Healthcare: How I Worked With the Dems to Fix the #ACA."
Fight to save ACA
Jobs, taxes and healthcare where do you stand on these priorities

But you endorse the president and his bullshit EPA?
You say FU to your constituents on healthcare tomorrow guess what we're going to say to you in 2020 after two years in the minority?
Vote NO on the unseen #trumpcare. This will save lots lives.
.@senrobportman Will you fight to save my family with pre-existing conditions by voting NO on Trumpcare?  You seem to avoid this topic.
How can you vote yes on a motion to proceed like this?
We Ohioans deserve better.
Bust down state borders on insurance
Thanks 
Please fight to protect our healthcare. PLEASE vote no tomorrow. This is far too important to rush.
This is good.. Now a No vote on Repeal would be greatly appreciated.
Lake Erie's an easy one. Tell us how you're going to keep Ohioans covered for health care..without lying or using false numbers, please.
Why don't you fight for our healthcare?
Please fight as hard for our health care Mr. Portman.
The vote you will live with forever  https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/07/24/gop-senators-dont-approve-mystery-health-bill-david-durenberger-column/502976001/ …  #wealthcare #mysterybill
Enough with the other stuff. Lake Erie important but vote NO. Enough distractions. Vote NO don't ignore your constituents.
Protect it from what? You must have basically nothing to do?
Vote yes to repeal the disaster known as Obamacare
Please protect healthcare too. $12,000 policies for seniors? Medicaid cuts gor nursing homes? No maternity coverage? Vote No!!!!!!
Please Senator don't vote on a bill to take health care away from millions!  We don't even know what's in it. Ohioan's are counting on you !
Yet, you won't vote to help the people of your state by voting NO on the healthcare bill that no one has seen
Please fight as hard for Ohioans health care as you do Great Lakes....vote No on Health Care
Thanks for sharing, Senator. Here's a share for you to remind you to just vote NO!
I was the first & only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid. Huckabee copied me.
So you're going to keep hiding from the #healthcare conversation? Vote no on the new mystery #Trumpcare bill!
too bad your weak @POTUS doesn't care about the Great Lakes.
"Fighting to save the environment by confirming a scientifically illiterate corporate shill to head the EPA" by Rob Portman
He will be disgraced and out of office before you have to run. Don't hitch your wagon to the Russian star.
You voted for Pruitt.   That was not Fighting for L. Erie or any other part of the natural world.
Fight to protect our Healthcare. This vote is insane.  You'd destroy our democracy for this miserable thing so 45 & McConnell can look good?
My healthcare depends on senators like you, Mr. Portman. Put your people before politics. #FixACA #Save32Mil #HealthcareMatters
YOU VOTED FOR Pruitt! How did that help. Be like @SenSherrodBrown and @RepMarcyKaptur
Senator Portman listen to your constituents! Vote NO tomorrow or you will be voted out! That's a promise. Country before party! #Resist 
Quit avoiding the crucial issues of the day. If the GOP wasn't full of lunatics Lake Erie would be just fine.
#voteno on #trumpcare, Senator! Your constituents like my disabled mother need their health insurance.
stop messing with our healthcare and side with American people and not that demagogue
#VOTENOFOROHIO

INTERACTIVE: Under #BRCA, older & low-income people would see largest premium increases compared to #ACA http://kaiserf.am/2tErJhl  
Fight the urge in McConnell's Office OHIO is watching!!!
Protect Lake Erie how? Via "burdensome government regulation" on businesses that might otherwise pollute it?
Fight to protect our healthcare! Tax breaks for the rich do not justify leaving poor, sick, disabled, seniors without good healthcare.
Fight to protect Health Care!! Lake Erie can't help me, with my health!!!
Please protect our healthcare too and vote NO to repeal!  Don't forget people above party!!!! Thank you for being an honorable rep!!!!
You voted for Pruitt. No credibility

They voted Trump and need health care. A Democrat-doctor volunteers http://nbcnews.to/2upvJkB  via @nbcnews
Healthcare! Where are you?
Your twitter person needs to be fired!  Stone cold deafness, its healthcare and Trumps Collusion. You not holding town halls.
Please listen to Gov. Kasich.
It is a mistake for the Senate to proceed with a vote on Tuesday. 
Really?
How about fighting this shameful healthcare bill! Vote NO!
Fight to protect your constituents! VOTE NO on this #Wealthcare bill that will destroy the lives of middle class Americans!
Fight to protect Ohioans healthcare! Vote NO on the Senate healthcare bill.
And yet @ScottPruitt is working hard to gut the EPA
I'm beyond asking and urging you to vote against the upcoming healthcare bill.  I'm now begging.  Please... speak for us who need good care.
Are you going to vote "yes" on repeal? Answer the question.
Really, Senator. I hope you are better than this and vote No.
Cornyn says they are trying to get doctor approval for McCain to come back tomorrow for healthcare vote (!)
Let's hope that your oft-posted win of $50 million from BO has prepared you to win back $350 from DJT.  Our lake needs you to win!
Protect your constituents and vote NO on Trumpcare.
Why won't you fight to protect the healthcare of Ohioans
What's in the healthcare bill?
Where was your "fight" when you voted Scott Pruitt as head of EPA? Knowing damn well he would destroy Lake Erie safeguards?
TY Senator for being willing to protect the Great Lakes, we certainly need clean water! Could you also protect our HC? We need that too. THX
Fight to protect us! #VoteNoOnTrumpcare
More immediately concerned with your plans to fight against the GOP healthcare bill(s).  They are all bad bills, Rob.
Sweet summer child, nobody  has forgotten about your Pruitt vote. 
Fight to protect our health tomorrow. Vote NO on cutting access to care for >22 million. Don't be bullied, threatened. Vote NO w/integrity.
My wife is an EXPERT on Obama are and she said it failing. Nothing left but to repeal it and start fresh.
Here's the number to call to remind the Senator to protect our lake AND our healthcare. Vote no. 202-224-3353
That is going to be so easy without the EPA interfering, Right, Rob? Your party has no moral compass. Maybe its your war on education.
30 years of hatred of education and intellectuals has reduced your party to Trump supporters. Maybe its time to reconsider?

Lookin' at you: @BillCassidy @senrobportman @SenDeanHeller @ChuckGrassley @SenToomey @CoryGardner. #KillTheBill Do not #RepealAndRun 
Senator, we need you to fight for people. Vote NO on the senate bill for healthcare/tax relief for rich ppl.

.@ChrisMurphyCT explains how Obamacare isn't dying — Trump is purposefully killing it 
Why do you lie ? You put Pruitt in office to kill everything and sold your state out  Sold out your country for dark money
Why aren't you taking our calls? You could send a tweet. Just one. If not a no vote on hc, we will not support you in the future.
Just a reminder - MILLIONS of Americans are relying on YOU to make our lives better, not worse. Don't gut medicaid.  VOTE NO!
Thank you. Please fight to save people with disabilities too by not supporting cuts or caps to Medicaid.

Former GOP senator: Resist the bullying. Don't vote for a mystery health care bill. https://usat.ly/2uYjBsq  via @usatoday
We the people are watching in 2018 . We are taking over the GOP!
How about you fight to repeal obamacare like your promised . You will be primaried at the end of your term if you don't We have had enough.
You will literally tweet about anything besides healthcare right now, won't you. We need real #leadership Rob. Ohioans deserve better.

6- What could you possibly negotiate @robportman that would be worth making health care much more expensive for everyone?
