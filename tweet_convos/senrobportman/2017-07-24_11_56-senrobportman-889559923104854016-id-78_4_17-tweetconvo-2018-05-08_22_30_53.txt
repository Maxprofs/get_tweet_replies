6- What could you possibly negotiate @robportman that would be worth making health care much more expensive for everyone? 
Rob's net worth is $14.5 million he had no idea of the pearls that medical issues can have on a family's finances.

"I'm begging, Senator Heller" - This woman is battling stage 4 cancer and Trumpcare at the same time

Schumer doubles down on his earlier calls for a bipartisan health care plan 
 

We believe government should work for you & for the millions of hard working Americans who just need #ABetterDeal. Here's our plan: 

We are ready to improve the healthcare system at any time. But we are not willing to throw tens of millions off their care to fund tax cuts. 
Yes, u like to spend other people's money
