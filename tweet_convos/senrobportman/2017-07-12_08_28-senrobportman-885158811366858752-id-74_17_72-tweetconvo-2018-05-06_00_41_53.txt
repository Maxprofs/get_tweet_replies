Rob please stop!  I agree with this but you are sounding like a Trump Parrot. Stand on your own and do what is right for us.
We won't Senator. Not with trump "in power." Sickening.
It's also important that you stand against Russian interference in our electoral process. These issues are linked.
You'll stand with Ukraine against Russian aggression and yet are silent about Russian aggression to USA voting? #GOPhypocrisy
Ukraine is the front line. If Ukraine succeeds, Russia falls. Russia can't survive with a democratic, flourishing Ukraine next door.
Equally important that you stand with the US against Russian aggression that has infiltrated the WH. When will you denounce this president?
If you stand with Ukraine, Russia will be toast. Russia depends on a weakened Ukraine to survive.
You can be a hero...just denounce Trump and all the rest as the traitorous bastards they are. A town hall/news conf would be the venue.
I agree with u & appreciate you keeping this topic @ the forefront- but for the love of democracy speak o/ against Trump & support the NEWS
You need to demand truth re Russian interference, wherever that may lead even to the White House. Ohio voter. Speak out.
You are well beyond incompetent now and entering blatantly destructive territory.
Trump sold our future to Putin. We can't be on both sides of the fence at the same time. Call out Russian collusion!
I'm more concerned about Russian aggression against the United States.
How can that happen when the SCROTUS supports Russia? SAD!!!
But what are you & other @GOP cronies willing to do to protect democracy?  When will you start holding Trump accountable?
Until Republican lawmakers stand up to #Trump, you have a NO credibility issue on this.  Time to fix the #GOP and rebuild trust. #Ohio
You're complicit with Trump. Only voted against him twice - one a "brave" vote that passed 97-2.
Standing with #Ukraine means standing up to @POTUS. You finally willing to do that for the good of Ohio and the nation?
What about Russian agrees ion towards the US? You have yet to admit that Russia meddled in our election!
ukrane? what about the russians in the whitehouse? vote no on trumpcare it will limit our choices.
Equally as important as standing with your constituents while the @GOP works to take away their access to affordable health care @PPact
And against Russia electing orange monsters to run OUR country?
You need to stand up for your country against the Russian agents in the White House
Important that you get busy on healthcare and tax cuts
You/we need to stand up to Russian aggression in whatever form it takes.......Ukraine-yes........Interference with our elections-YES!
#25amendmentnow
Sure, we can stand up, but POTUS is posting Amazon links for good deals on Rosetta Stone "Russian" tapes.
A little late in the game, but I like it.
You won't even stand up against Russian aggression in our elections.
Don't you secretly wish we had a President who agreed? Or even really understood what you're talking about here?
Also important to stop the Russians from hyper-targeting our voters and damaging our election process
Fraud.

What has America come to when GOP lawmakers see nothing wrong in meeting w/ Kremlin emissaries promising interference in our politics?
Then man up and tell @realDonaldTrump that he needs to end his bromance with Putin!!
And yet POTUS colluded with Russia to damn Clinton, refuses to denounce their attacks on our country, and is buddy-buddy with Putin now.
The moment you grow a backbone regarding the Comrade-in-Chief, I'll start taking seriously your tough guy act towards Russia.
Can we PLEASE talk about healthcare? 52% of babies born in #Ohio are thanks to Medicaid! Why do you put addicts above babies?
Come on! Trump owes Putin favors. Trump's agenda is about his personal wealth. He and Putin have an arrangement.
Why don't you say something to your Putin loving President and all his Putin loving friends?  You never speak out against them.  Townhalls?
Why don't we investigate Victoria Nuland's role in the Ukraine coup in 2014?
Imp't for the US to stand with the US against Russia.  When is anyone in the Congress going to get real about this?

Healthcare...what is your position?  Please quit deflecting.  Stop taking cues from POTUS.  Vote no!
What specific measures do you stand for?  I support you on this but would like to know what's happening from your efforts.
Our biggest source of Russian aggression comes from the trump W.H. Which you whole heartedly support.#resign
Have you talked to anyone in the house about the sanctions bill they won't pass on this very topic?
.@senrobportman imp't that US Congress stand with US citizens to protect our country from Russian aggression and traitors within #winkwink
Are you blind to the irony of your own tweet, Rob? #wakeup
What about the GOP platform? I recall language regarding Ukraine being changed to be more Russia-friendly, per Trump request.
Should have done something several yrs ago. Putin already has a stronghold in Ukraine
The Colluder in the White House Is our biggest security threat! #TrumpRussiaCoverUp
If your going to say Russian aggression is unacceptable then why as you so silent on trump and the new news that came out ??
How about you stand with the United States.? Russia cyber-attacked us on behalf of @realDonaldTrump. Why are you silent on this? #Collusion
You changed the GOP platform to sell out the Ukraine .So stop pretending your are backing the Ukraine
What about the Russian aggression aimed at the US? Election hacking? Undeniable trump campaign collusion? Don't see you taking stand at all.
Did you know our own White House is compromised by the Russian government?   Maybe you could do something about that.
Important that R Senators stand with their constituents as the current administration is working with and for Russia.
Russia is also slowly encroaching into Georgia.  They have no respect for any nation's sovereignty.  Also, vote NO on AHCA!
Let's never mind those Russians in the White House? This has got to be the most idiotic and ill timed tweet ever. Talk about out of touch!
So you'll be calling to impeach Russia's stooge? Vote no on #Trumpcare
How about standing w/ us on #Medicaid in Ohio. Stand up to Trump & be #countrybeforeparty on Russian interference #TrumpRussiaCollusion
Standing with Ukraine means standing up against Russian interference in our election. It's all related.  Silence is no longer acceptable.
I'm pretty sure that every member of the GOP only believes in party over country, even if they go on Twitter/TV to say they're "concerned."
How about the russian aggression against the US?  Are you going to take a stand on that?
Ukraine interfered in our election too get Hillary elected
No....
lol

A horrific metaphor for Trumpcare: this disabled woman literally being ripped from her wheelchair.

To be clear, Obamacare isn't failing. @realdonaldtrump is sabotaging it.

Must-watch. Beyond powerful.

Mike Phillips, who lives w/ spinal muscular atrophy, on what losing Medicaid benefits would mean for his care.

This veteran is doing whatever she can to protect her son from the Republican health care bill 
Hybrid warfare techniques? Is that like subverting our elections by passing information to the Trump cartel?
Tweets about Ukraine are a safe space Rob, what about Russia coming into our own elections and potential influence over the current admin?
