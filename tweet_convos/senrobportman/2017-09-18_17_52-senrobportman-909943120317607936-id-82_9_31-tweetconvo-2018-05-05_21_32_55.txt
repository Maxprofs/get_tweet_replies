Speaking of #Ukraine a photo taken of a #RussianFloridaPropertyInvestors of #Trump (right) w/ Putin's guy he used to annex #Crimea.
MULTIMILLIONAIRE @senrobportman plans to STEAL healthcare from MILLIONS of Americans to give MASSIVE TAX CUTS to the RICH!!!

#ConManRob
Senator, true. More true is that the USA must protect healthcare for our citizens. Read this thread.
Somehow, they keep missing the point. A partisan push, without even one single committee hearing, isn't how to move fwd on health care. 1/
You and your fellow congressman are a joke. You couldnt even keep a sex trafficking bill in the defense  bill?
What does this have to do with the issue at hand?? https://twitter.com/imillhiser/status/909868493868343301 …
How about supporting people on ACA here in Ohio and stop the charade of repeal efforts. Left a message at your office to tell you so.
It's not just ACA. #GrahamCassidy would bring back preexisting conditions for everyone.
You tweeting about this when people are BEGGING for their lives is insulting. STOP ATTACKING THE HEALTH CARE OF OHIOANS. #GrahamCassidy

Our @will_c_fischer says #GrahamCassidy is just #TrumpCare with a new name and still takes health care away from thousands of #veterans. 
Keep our Healthcare. How many times must you put us through this? If nothing else, think about your karma.
Support us for once! We're begging to speak to you, begging you not to steal our healthcare. Have you no conscience? #voteno #GrahamCassidy

Do YOU want to evict seniors from nursing homes

I can't believe my actual life is in the hands of someone so cruel. Vote no on #GrahamCassidy and be a hero. I have no hope in you though.
Its mind boggling to me how you guys dont do anything right. yes i know there is a hearing today(tuesday) on the bill but.....
#VoteNOGrahamCassidy
You work for Ohioans. ACA repeal betrays the American people. Your yes vote would be a betrayal of your constituents. We will not forget.
Vote no on Graham Cassidy
Graham-Cassidy.
VOTE NO.  VOTE NO.  VOTE NO.  VOTE NO.
Put people before party! Remember, a 'yes' vote will ensure the end of your career.
So I'm guessing you want Ukraine in NATO now? You liberal republicans are all the same.
This goes beyond politics.This is about the goodness or cruelty of people like you. That is how history will see you. A hero, or heartless.
How can you vote with no CBO score? What are Republicans trying to hide? How many will lose coverage? Preexist conds protections gone? Bad!
How about helping citizens by voting against healthcare repeal! Always enough for other countries but not US
45 has too much retweeting to do to bother declaring opioid crisis emergency. Comments?
Dear @IvankaTrump, As a champion for the advancement of women,thought you should know @POTUS retweeted a GIF of HRC getting hit w/a golfball https://twitter.com/fuctupmind/status/908163011793358848 …
Keep our Healthcare.
Why are you silent on #GrahamCassidy ? Oh, right, because you are wrong and know it. Kill children and bankrupt seniors. Got it.
You and your coworkers are an absolute joke and cant do anything right.
Even after telling us there was a strong chance it would be added? Its like you want Backpage, a site of child trafficking to stay up
Thank you USA for supporting Ukraine
We all know nothing big is gonna happen and you will be scared of lawsuits. I guarantee by next summer backpage will still be up
Publicly renounce #GrahamCassidy. Stand up for your constituents for once!  End this roller coaster. We deserve better #voteno #saveaca
Call @senrobportman provide first & last name & zip. Tell him not to repeal Obamacare 1-800-205-6446 or 202-224-3353 use manners, be kind.
Vote no #VoteNOGrahamCassidy . If you vote for this to pass,  you are going to be killing people. Vote no. Have a heart.
You want to murder millions of Americans by denying them Healthcare but support someone else. Traitor murderer money for lives
Please listen to the governor and vote no on #GrahamCassidy.
Somehow, they keep missing the point. A partisan push, without even one single committee hearing, isn't how to move fwd on health care. 1/
Senator, if your staff can find the time to send all of these tweets, then they can answer your phones and explain your healthcare position
Help YOUR constituents. Vote NO on the graham Cassidy bill.
United States must support its own citizens' access to health care. Take a big step forward today, @senrobportman: No on Graham-Cassidy.
Why the silent treatment on healthcare? LISTEN TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS! WE ARE REAL PEOPLE SCREAMING FOR YOUR HELP #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
When did you become a Misanthrope? Law school? Kids? Family? What/who let you down? #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
How about supporting your constituents and voting NO on #GrahamCassidy ?
The United States MUST support and care for the sick, the children, the elderly, the handicapped by keeping the ACA.
You and your colleagues are going to vote on healthcare that dramatically impacts Medicaid - without debate or scoring!  That's corrupt!!
Which folks are those exactly Senator?  Who would YOU throw the money at?
Y'all can clearly see that a very LARGE amount of constituents say vote NO on #GrahamCassidy. Listen to them. Everybody call his office!!!!!
What about that corrupt PM from Malaysia visiting with 45 at the WH?
Once again, Portman Republicans trying to eliminate our medical care +repeal health care for children+ pre-existing condition protection.
With your knowledge & concern about Ukraine you must be more aware than most of us about Russian interference. But you never stand up.  Sad.
The United States should support the health of our citizens by giving them affordable and accessible insurance. Healthcare is a right!
No one gives a shit about this, Bobby. Vote no
No on Graham Cassidy. Why are you tweeting about other stuff right now you clown
So countries who sell missile parts and technology to North Korea are our allies?
 What color is the sky in YOUR world?
@embena 
@KG_Smith
Oh, did the GOP change its platform? Trump insisted Ukraine language be more friendly to Russia.
#VoteNOGrahamCassidy
Bob... You're killing me... VOTE NO ON #Trumpcare!
Start by supporting us against Trump, Rob.
Rob-Us-of-Our-Healthcare Portman shows us again he has no backbone. He doesn't care about Ohioans - just big donors. #GrahamCassidy #VoteNo
As an Ohio native I can tell you that Ohioans are not happy with @senrobportman. I'm an Uber driver... we talk. 2018
Rob Portman is nothing but a photo ops participant. He is purposefully directing attention away from issues that matter to most Ohions.
See you tomorrow.I'll be at the protest urging you to vote no on Graham-Cassidy. Protect and expand healthcare.
Portman, why aren't you protecting your constituents by publicly renouncing #GrahamCassidy ? Why are you dodging our calls? #SaveACA #voteNo
#MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
I asked people to share what it's like to live in a country with universal health care. The responses that came in were incredible. 
#safespacerob tweets about our allies abroad rather than answer tough questions about his own constituents healthcare needs at home. Sad!
Apparently @senrobportman  never learned of Adams warning of foreign entanglements. We should not be doing what they Gloat about on the Hill
STOP #GrahamCassidy
We are like way more worried you are gonna vote to take away our health care... #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
A better first step would be to stop the President from being BFF's with Putin.
