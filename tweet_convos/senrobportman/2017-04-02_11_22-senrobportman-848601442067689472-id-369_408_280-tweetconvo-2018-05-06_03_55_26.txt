Please! No! Do the right thing for America!
A SCOTUS judge should not be confirmed while POTUS is under investigation for Russia.
Blatant obstructionism against Merrick Garland.
But you vote for a candidate from a guy that is under investigation? That's dumb.
#NoGorsuch Stolen election Stolen #SCOTUS seat #ImpeachTrump instead
Please vote him in!
No @senrobportman, in fact, I emphatically DISAGREE! Vote No to a justice nominated by a treasonous crazy man!
Please don't go nuclear. There is already too much wrong going on with our democracy. Trump has whole list. Buy first car see? Please don't.
No more confirmations or executive orders until the Russia issue is fully examined and resolved.
NO on Gorsuch! You're party is out of control!  Has no one got ANY sensibility in Washington? Trump must go! Good Lord!
Watching you speak on #cspan. Thank you for speaking passionately re: #DrugEpidemic I strongly disagree with #Gorsuch & changing of rules
1. The Rs were wrong in denying Garland 2.Until investigation into Russia complete,no SC appt.3.If Gorguch, will taint SC! NO
Flynn's immunity request proves that we MUST postpone Gorsuch vote until we have answers from FBI   #RussiaGate #ATN
No he should not be. Your represent my voice and I say no thanks
Holy cow I just read all of the responses to this tweet & I sure as hell hope @senrobportman has read them too! #saynotogorsuch
Unfortunately, @senrobportman has proven vote after vote that what his constituents want does not matter to him. He is bought & paid for
Politics aside, why can't you find someone who will stand up for Ohio workers? Ohio's women? Our rights as people & citizens?
He's a party or die man.
You'd think that "qualified" was defined by the ability to write a brief. As a former federal clerk, I can say that rarely gets one on bench
NO GORSUCH!! NO NUCLEAR OPTION! Listen to your constituents & NOT McConnell for a change! GORSUCH=wrong! No vote while trump investigated!!!
Please do not blow up the fillibuster tomorrow. You guys blocked Garland for a year,don't be hypocrites and shove Gorsuch through so quickly
No Gorsuch appointment until lyin Putin puppet and his administration is cleared from all investigations!  MERRICK GARLAND, a fine man!
NO! I DO NOT AGREE.  HE DOES NOT RULE FIR PEOPLE HE RULES FIR CORPORATIONS AT THE EXPENSE AND HARM OF PPL. CAPS INTENDED. NO
I also refuse to entertain Gorsuch nom. POTUS is under fed investig. WAIT.  (&you refused Garland just bec Obama in final yr, not investig!)
DON’T NUKE the Senate rules just to rush Gorsuch into a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court.
He should not, and he will not be good for the people you are asking to retweet.
If you can't get 60% to support him, then you need to get a new nominee. Shame on you for stealing this position and killing the filibuster
I'm conservative and I don't like him. There has to be better.
Ohio proud and I disagree
As your constituent, as a woman, as a human who cares for other humans over corporations, I disagree, and am disappointed in you, Senator.
wait till trump investigation is done
Nope, nope, nope
The guy is evasive & rabidly conservative. Not what The People want or deserve. He is a danger to Our democracy #nogorsuch #changethenominee
No! What's the hurry? What if the absolute worst about 45 is true. SCOTUS doesn't need that taint for the next forty years.
disagree! Why didn't you meet with Merrick Garland? #SCOTUS #StolenSeat
Dont you want to say you opposed @POTUS on at least one thing?

#StopGorsuch

@SenJeffMerkley is a real leader and hero of #TheResistance
I think you misspelled Merrick Garland.
Not one person agrees with you
No nuclear option. This is not the time !! Side with constituents.
Ohio is calling. Pick up your phone. Check your messages. Ask your staff what Ohio is saying.  #notogorsuch #ATN
We should NOT confirm a SCOTUS judge while our President is under investigation. Let's wait to see how that turns out first please !
He plagiarized other people's writing without giving them credit, isn't that an issue with you? A supreme court nominee that blatantly lies?
No, Garland should be our next #SCOTUS justice, but neither matters. Don't have 60 votes. #dontdelegitimizeSCOTUS #donotkillthefilibuster
#notogorsuch #ATN
absolutely-freaking NOT SIR. Gorsuch is no friend to women. #ChangeTheCandidate #NoNuclearOption  #NoGorsuch
Amen!! Gorsuch is the absolute best for the job! It's amusing dems wanted him -until Trump nominated him.  Such Insane loosers they are!!!
It's tradition that a president under investigation for Treason shall get zero nominations.
where do you guy's get this crap from
Same place @SenateMajLdr got his made up rules for blocking Merrick Garland.
LOSING ALL AROUND
37% approval rating for traitor POTUS says otherwise!
LOL and Trump only has a 2% chance of beating Hillary
So your okay with selling Am citizens browsing hx, Dow pesti. to poison our enviromnent & water and Gorsuch a plagiarist to a lifelong job
What about the plagiarism allegation? When I was teaching, I'd never give a plagiarist an A. But you'd place one on the US Supreme Court?
Please don't change the Senate rules to confirm Gorsuch.
Merrick Garland can’t even get a meeting w/ a single Senate GOP leader: http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/03/17/mitch_mcconnell_told_merrick_garland_not_to_bother_visiting_senate_republicans.html?wpsrc=sh_all_dt_tw_top … via @slate #HoldTheFloor #SCOTUS #Gorsuch
Portman says he will oppose Merrick Garland's Supreme Court nomination #HoldTheFloor #SCOTUS #Gorsuch
Why are you giving a lifetime appt to someone under FBI investigation for TREASON? When will GOP put the country first?
No. No he shouldn't. Gorsuch = No.
Gorsuch = NO
Intolerant 
Sexist
Racist…
NOPE....#HOLDTHEFLOOR @realDonaldTrump is a TREASONOUS CRIMINAL and will be IMPEACHED #ImpeachTrump
@GorsuchFacts : He plagiarized. Still eager to confirm him? BTW...still waiting for a town hall in #Toledo. #ChickenRob
Mr Portman this is another reason I won't be voting you in for another term.
Let the Dems & die bards bury themselves. In six months Our Country will be firmly on the path to #MAGA
Don't tell me to RT if you won't take responsibility for your actions #education #EPA #GreatLakes and avoiding your constituents
NO, until FBI investigation into Trump and Russia is over!
After Merrick Garland is confirmed.
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY WRONG!!!  No GORSUCH vote!!!
no justice for a president in the last year of his term. Sorry.
NO CONFIRM UNTIL WE LEARN.
DO NOT KILL THE FILIBUSTER.
DO NOT KILL THE FILIBUSTER.
DO NOT KILL THE FILIBUSTER.
DO NOT KILL THE FILIBUSTER.
You are wrong again!  No on Gorsuch.
what I think is that you should #ConfirmGarland and any nominee who can't get 60 votes can't get them for a reason.
Merick Garland. Vancacy was President Obama's to fill.
I urge you NOT to support Gorsuch til FBI completes Trump/Russia investigation. PLEASE represent us in your district who want answers 1st.
Why would you promote a bill that would allow ISP to sell our private data and allow use of pesticide that causes brain damage to children?
No way!!!!! #voteno you are still blaming Obama for #Trumprussia you @senrobportman need to be replaced. #whyIMarch #womensmarch #Resistance
I disagree! Listen to your constituents for a change. #WeObject
Merrick Garland should have been appointed.
Garland? Bueller?
A vote for rules change will be your resignation letter!!! #2022
#MerrickGarland #MerrickGarland  #noprobenorobe 
BTW...when are you going to have a townhall?
Who paid you to say that?
you stole this opportunity from Garland. How does one do that to another professional? You have no decency, Sir.
Coward on the party line since there's no midterm threat. Pathetic
Go nuclear!  We deplorables gave you that 9pt edge in Ohio.  Please don't forget about us.
the white house has come out and said he will be the next justice at midnight Friday
No, No he should not, tired of religious and political men pretending to know better then me, my GOD and my OB/GYN STOP.
Where do all the left wing whackos come from? They crawl,out of the woodwork like cockroaches at midnight!!
Nominated by a president under investigation for treason and elected by the minority of voters. NO WAY!
i thing the wole repuke party has turned commie. why else would they refuse a idependent prosicoter
vote no on gorsich, yes on galrand
Vote NO On GORSUCH AND NO ON THE NUCLEAR OPTION OR I will do everything I c an to vote you out of office
We've already started the next election cycle, we should let the American people decide who will nominate the next justice. No #gorsuch
#POSTPONEGORSUCH #RUSSIA #TRAITOR #TREASON #IMPEACH #NOTMYPRESIDENT #RESIST #PARTYOVERCOUNTRY #COMPLICIT #COLLUSION #WRONGSIDEOFHISTORY
You have personally stolen this seat assuring the illegitimacy of the Court for a generation! #StolenSeat #BlockGorsuch
If dems keep tantrumin then put them in time out with NUKE!
The only reason liberal loonies have to oppose him is spite
Ohio says Vote no! And you don't get to change the rules just because you don't get your way.
yes, but you're being too nice and point out the hypocrisy of "activist judge" being thrown at #Gorsuch when we have Kagen/Sotomayor.
Well, actually, Garland should be, but,  you know...
Gorsuch seems OK. You sure you want to enable nuclear option. This may have been avoided had there been a vote on Garland. Just saying.
Let's think about this. You prevented the constitutional right of President @BarackObama and now you think you deserve support? DO YOUR JOB
Why don't you answer all the people asking you about #MerrickGarland ?
Admire the Dems for closing ranks as opposed to GOP who rubber stamped Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Kagan despite their lack of qualifications
ABSOLUTELY NO SCOTUS CONFIRMATION UNTIL WE HAVE AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION, ROB. #confirmRussiainvolvement #confirmRussiaTrumpcollusion
No! Do you represent the PEOPLE of Ohio or Corporations?
Judge Gorsuch repeatedly said he has to rule based on laws you write. Please do YOUR job and fix citizens united. Get corporate  $$$ out.
Absolutely not. We don't need more religious ideologues pushing their agendas.
So, how much money did ya get for voting for Gorsuch?
Confirm Merrick Garland first.
It is beyond frustrating and disappointing that we are stuck with you until 2022. No new SCOTUS until after investigations are complete.
i agree and he will be come Friday
Not so fast. The president who appointed him to a lifetime position is under FBI investigation. No vote under investigation.
No he shouldn't. You screwed over Obama's nominee,  now I hope the Democrats do everything in their power do return the favor.
Nope. Sorry. Not with the #russiagate investigation. #stolenseat
I'd hope you'd stand up to McConnell on nuclear opt but since you didn't on garland I'm not holding my breath #PartyHack #GOPoverUSA
I disagree.  Merrick Garland should have had a hearing.  #stole seat
You spelled Merrick Garland wrong
More important to us is how you stand on filibuster? Do not make the SCOTUS a partisan pawn, 60 votes or no Gorsuch
This seat belongs to Merrick Garland. Your party failed it's constitutional duty now trying to blame Dems. Go ahead nuke it.
I agree
Merrick Garland, that is all
.@senrobportman In 2013: 68 individual nominees blocked prior to Obama taking office and 79 (so far) during Obama’s term, for a total of 147
Possible impeachment is reason to filibuster Gorsuch.  Pause all this and investigate!
Vote for Gorsuch he's a good and fair man
No lifetime appointment allowed for a president under investigation. Grouch is for big money that has corrupted our elections
No - actually @senrobportman he should NOT...
Don't agree.
Gorsuch gave so many non-answers that I, a legal professional, can't judge his positions on many issues.  And what's yr excuse for Garland?
You don't care what we Ohioans think.  Your offices here in Ohio don't take calls.  Further, you've already made up your mind.  1/2
Maybe you should tweet about issues your constituents care about. Like healthcare and combating our INSANE LYING POTUS!!
No... Garland should have been next justice on the SCOTUS
I think Garland should be confirmed.
terrible choice, but then you have been making terrible choices for Ohioans all along.  Not a free thinker ...just following party line.
Hell NO!
No probe, no robe. No Gorsuch!
The *ONLY* person that should be our next #SCOTUS justice is #MerrickGarland. Quit pretending you aren't actively desecrating your station.
No, he should not. He is an opponent of individual rights protected by the Constitution. Aw shucks demeanor doesn't supersede decisions.
Your constituents do not agree with moving forward with Gorsuch. We need you to speak out,and up, about the extent of Russian interference.
No!!! No nuclear option (sneaky cowards), no appointment under investigation, NO GORSUCH!!! @OhioDistrict12 @CbusIndivisible
What was your justification for not voting for #MerrickGarland? How is what the Dems are doing now any different than what @GOP did then?
Do you know he'll follow Constitution? He won't answer direct questions. At least one ruling overturned. Deflecting like Trump both of you
No, I disagreed
You asked for replies. Are you even paying attention?  Obviously, if you were you would not confirm and would have given Garland a vote.
Majority of #Ohioans do NOT agree. We don't need an extremist. We don't need a #Corporate #Yesman. WAKE-UP ROB!
Do not confirm ANYBODY until the #independentinvestigation says us whats up w/45*. This is too serious. #listentoALLOHIOANS #whatareyoudoing
Absolutely NOT! MERRICK GARLAND #NOtoStolenSCOTUSseat
The Senate should have confirmed Merrick Garland. Please stop pretending that you're doing your job.
Vote no!! The least popular president under FBI investigation should not nominate. This is a stolen seat from Obama. Disgraceful GOP.
Nope
NO!  He has no respect for individuals.  Same as you @senrobportman   And appointed by an idiot who is under federal investigation. No.
Nope. You stole the nomination and you're not listening. 45735.
I disagree @senrobportman. Neil Gorsuch should NEVER be a justice. NEVER!!!!
No he shouldnt. Perhaps if u & GOP had been fair & considerate of #MerrickGarland things would b different. Dems havent been #DISRESPECTUL!
I could be a lot more compassionate about Gorsuch if not for the Rs' unacceptable & childish treatment of Garland.
No confirmation until Trump/Putin/Russian investigation is complete. Hypocritical to refuse Garland only to confirm Gorsuch #RejectGorsuch
No, and If he can't get 60 votes he should not be confirmed. We need a moderate.  Please protect the filibuster.
Please respect your constituents and hold this decision until Trump's many issues are resolved. #RejectGorsuch #PostponeConfirmation
No.
Merrick Garland should be our next #SCOTUS justice. RT if you agree that his seat was stolen. 
I vote NO.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO! 
#noooooooooo
Gorsuch does not have your women constituents' best interests in mind. I beseech to vote NO.
I disagree, not that you care what your constituents think! #StopGorsuch
I agree. Right after approving Garland.
Saying it over and over again doesn't make it right. Merrick Garland should have been our #scotus justice a year ago.
Until such a time as the current administration is not under suspicion of collusion with a foreign power during the campaign, no appointees.
No he should not. You all are acting disgracefully.
I believe an administration should fulfill its duty to nominate, I believe Congress has duty to vote.  And I believe Party Politics be null!
What about Merrick Garland?  Was he not qualified?  Republicans just snuffed out a possible dream career for someone because of politics!!
No to favoritism for corporate America. Vote NO!
and if I disagree?
What about Judge Garland? Still waiting... #Shame
Do I fav for Garland??? #ConfirmGarland then we can talk Gorsuch next time.
Garland should be the next Justice.  Give him a fair hearing, then will be open to Trump's nominee getting a fair hearing.
nope
Disagree
RT if you're a hypocrite and should've confirmed Garland
You're wrong on this one, Rob, just like you were wrong about Pruitt. Gee, I'm beginning to think you're a lousy judge of character.
No. Just no. Do not confirm until Russian investigation is complete. Are you listening? Ohio is.
Like Devos, Pruitt, Carson, and Perry.
NO!
With all due respect, your tweets on this matter go against your constituents wishes.  What will it take for you to listen?
Show us YOUR taxes so we know what side you're really on. #NoConfirmations while #Trumprussia is still going on
Dismal number of RTs but that won't stop you now will it.
Garland should be on SCOTUS. The acts you pulled over the past year to block him were despicable.
Judge Gorsuch will always have the shame of not being the true #SCOTUS justice! Shame on you!
