This is a meaningless statement you have helped sabotage the #ACA for years for political gain. What will you do now?
Holy crap Portman this might be the first semi smart thing you've ever said. We'll see if you actually come through or not though.
The deductibles are to high but at least we have it. Any 0lan which you yourself wouldn't want is not worth your vote.
Thank you.
#iamapreexistingcondition & am covered under Medicaid expansion in Ohio. I wouldn't live w/o it. Please #voteNO to the @HouseGOP health bill
Portman campaign, 13 Oct 13, Meet the Press: 
PORTMAN: I oppose ObamaCare. I think we ought to repeal it and replace it.
I'm glad to see that you have misgivings, and that you are thinking about Ohio. Please vote no--we'll hold you to this. #VoteNoAHCA
Please make the right choice and vote no! Chronically ill patients already have enough of a battle without adding poor insurance coverage
You're right, the status quo is not acceptable, and this bill is terrible.  So how about single payer, universal healthcare?
Rob Portman is a liar.  We Ohioians need to do everything possible to get him out of office!
you better cover preexisting conditions...this is b.s.
we all know you're worthless
Private insurers exist to make money.  Unless there is a viable, competitive, government alternative, premiums will continue to rise.
Legalize pot Save people Less opiates Less alcohol Reply welcome
The house bill is horrible. Please help find ways to keep Americans covered.
In what counties are there only "...one insurance company...?" Simply not true. Please b careful with ur wording that it not fuel more fear.
#Trumpcare does NOTHING 4 the most vulnerable of populations except leaves them behind!
Keep standing up @senrobportman. That's what #heroes are made of. Thank you for having compassion for the most vulnerable. #ohioproud
Use that to decide if you vote yes or no. I told Stiles and now you a wrong vote on this costs you my vote and all whom I can convince.
Good. The AHCA is an awful bill. Please support a Senate version of HR676 #MedicareForAll to build on ACA's progress while fixing its flaws.
Improve the current law!  Do NOT reverse pre existing conditions law!  It's proven high risk pools don't work.  ALL of Ohio needs your help!
Thank you for your work combating the #opioidcrisis - Ohioans need more help to get ahead of this, not less #VoteNoAHCA
Medicare and Medicaid must be reset back to its original enrollees, socialist healthcare is un-American
You're not even a constituent
Thank you. I don't have confidence in @freedomcaucus
We are watching and will remember your actions here. AHCA is an abomination. Support coverage for pre-existing conditions, or leave in 2018.
Thank you for not supporting the house bill as it is currently written, as it will certainly leave those with Medicaid & the addicted behind
respect your passion for opioid crisis.  Please remember there are other health care issues that need protected
Please work for the people sir ... the regular people. Everyone deserves access to healthcare.  Everyone including the poor and the sick.
Senator, where is the woman's voice on the healthcare committee? All white men,,,,,,really! This bill is cruel. Women are being denied.
Thank you for your service, however, disputes remain re: 'skyrocketing costs'. Please provide a source for your belief that costs are 
I live in Morgan County.  My wife and I have insurance thanks to Obama care. It is the best insurance we have had in years.
We will hold you to this
Thank you. Plz protect #Medicaid for the elderly, children, & ppl w/ disabilities too...like my medically fragile daughter.
We're going to hold you to your statement. This legislation leaves plenty of people behind.
I would say the AHCA makes me sick, but that probably would count as a preexisting condition
Please stop this bill from becoming law. It hangs the most vulnerable citizens out to dry and it's not what your constituents want!
Please make sure to protect Ohio's healthcare ,for elderly, people with pre-existing conditions , and addiction and mental health serv
Please vote NO on this issue. You have the potential to help people or hurt people. We implore you to vote NO.
So his means you will vote no?
THANK YOU. Please continue this stand.
I sincerely hope that when it comes time for the Senate to vote, you stick by this statement. #VoteNoACHA
We'll be holding you to this.
Repubs don't care abt "worthless junkies" or other "undeserving" folks or they wouldn't have passed #AHCA. I'll believe you when you vote NO
As a Republican please vote no.  Pre-existing conditions need to be protected. Instead of repeal an replace, try compromise and improve.
Contrary to others comments  I am a Dem who voted for you. I encourage you to vote no. Would you trust your family's health with the AHCA?
Better to undo Rubio's change---fund the risk pool for insurance companies.  SUPPORT subsidies, and medicaid. O'care has much 2 commend it.
Please stand by your word. There is more wrong than lack of drug addiction resources. Please protect my Type 1 diabetic daughter too.
We will be watching you. We have seen you put $ over Ohioans. We don't forget DeVos.
Please vote NO Senator Portman on the American Health Care Act.  Preexisting conditions cannot be ignored.
Thank you for standing up for what's right, regardless of what the "party" says.
House hell bent to pass anything. Throw 5B to pay down Ins on pre existing conditions. How long will that last?  Creating competition? Right
Your constituents deserve to know what is in a replacement plan and see proof its better than the Affordable Care Act does BEFORE any repeal
Ohio will remember how shitty of a senator and person you are.
Allowing millions to be uninsured will not lower health care costs and will provide great harm to many Ohioans. Please vote No on the AHCA
protect those struggling w/ addiction but also those with diabetes, cancer, hypertension, domestic violence victims, congenital defects etc
As an NP, I will be watching the senate with the #AHCA. It cannot go through in its current form #VoteNoAHCA
With that stance, I hereby declare I will do everything in my power to get you primaried and defeated. Welcome to McCaine - Graham wing.
Yes! Glad to see you are putting Ohioans first over the rich tax cuts. Cutting Medicaid is a huge burden on the state of Ohio.
Cut out the insurance mafia. Let's join the rest of the developed world and offer medical coverage for every citizen.
You know what's more important than stepping in line with your party? Doing what's right.
this bill will harm and bankrupt hospitals as well. Vote no to protect the sick, as well as their caregivers.
I see no comments here that support this bill. Does that tell you something? Most of us will be hurt by this obvious political posturing...
You all need to stop finding ways to change everything Obama accomplished just to satisfy the extremists on the right. You had years to...
offer improvements that would have kept insurance companies from pulling out and did nothing. Now you blame Obama for your lack of effort.
Like all things GOP, the rich will get richer and who cares about everyone else. Our only hope is that there are 3 GOP Senators with a heart
Let's hope you don't cave for the party line and really want to address costs. Fix drug price gouging, pay-for-delay and require competition
If u wouldn't use it for your own family then u should not vote for it. We'll remember how ur vote goes. DeVos bought ur vote for her seat 
@senrobportman You are correct it does not go far enough and it will raise my premiums. My wife and I can't afford it, neither can my Dad.
I am a what a preexisting condition looks like!  #multiplesclerosis #mssucks
You must vote no on the a HCA as it exists. Your constituency's lives depend on it
Women, vets, elderly...ALL Americans need protection from #Trumpcare. What is happening is not right. #VoteNoAHCA
Thank you Senator. Do people realize that what happens in the ACA will trickle down to employee and private insurance? Not a poor problem.
Though I don't agree with all of your views. Thank you for not supporting this terrible house bill. Please fight for the sick.
It is now up to you and your colleagues to fix this heartless GOP mess called Trumpcare! Good luck!
We'll be watching as this gets passed on to you. You had better vote to protect all of us. #iamapreexistingcondition AND I VOTE!
1st step was to get it out of the house. Now protect Medicare and pass it please
Thank you.
as long as we think "free market" (skewed to insurance cos) we will have exhorbitant increases. Let's learn fr Europe on this
I would hope you don't support a bill that also raises cost on preexisting conditions.
#saveMedicaid for the disabled
For profit insurance will continue to cost more with or without Obamacare. Medicare for all.
You will be voted out unless you stand up for the citizens of Ohio. I will personally work hard for that if you stand for this travesty.
It's fantastic you want to help victims of opioid crisis but I hope you will also protect people with pre-existing conditions, incl kids.
I don't really want govt purchasing healthcare;
Remember that everybody promised REPEAL OBUMERCARE MEANS REPEAL OBUMERCARE, PERIOD! CONSTITUTION DOESN'T COVER HC, REPEAL, PERIOD
Vote NO!We want @RandPaul bill!#FreeMarketHealthcare https://www.paul.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/ObamacareReplacementActSections.pdf â€¦
Congress should be charged with premeditated murder. I had an aunt who died before ACA because she didn't have insurance. #ShameShameShame
Thank you.  I hope you remain a no on this law.  Don't take insurance from millions of Americans.
Prove it with your actions, $enatorPortman.
look at all of these liberals praising u!They want u to vote no! Vote no and lose ur parties support and ur seat! Count on it
Yes, fix what is broken but don't make it worse with the #AHCA that harms so many of Ohioans and Americans.
Thank you @senrobportman for taking a strong stance beside the Ohioans who benefit form Medicaid expansion.  We can't leave them behind.
how about do what the voters tell you to do because that's why we elected you!  Vote yes on this current bill!
I appreciate your position. Please continue to be a responsible voice opposed to the inhumane House bill. If not, say goodbye to your office
I appreciate your concern, please vote NO to back up these words!
Senator, I am surprised but supportive of this statement.  Please maintain this course and vote No.

I could literally die if you do not.
Postpartum depression? C-sections? Domestic violence?! Please protect women and children. And all vulnerable Americans. Unacceptable.
Thank you, but don't think only of the opioid crisis. People with preexisting conditions deserve affordable care.
Terrible!!!
Insurance companies are holding America hostage because of their greed why are you voting for them and not us?
The opiate dealers on Medicare must really get to ya, especially the ones whose disabilities are mental/drug addiction. Kick em off!
Stand with us. #VoteNoAHCA
I hope the you and the Senate take a stand and vote this terrible bill down.
This is good. Even better: finding courage to admit that keeping and improving ACA makes more sense than GOPâ€™s endless repeal games.
You need to stop this nonsense. The only people who want this is congressional Republicans. Stop taking away from the middle class and poor!
What will you be voting?
Nice try. You're not only a liar, now you're a killer.
This bill will harm Ohioans more than the lack of multiple carriers. Please vote NO.
Work together to fix what's wrong w Obamacare.
If I go and get addicted to opiods, will you suddenly give a shit about my health? Because you don't seem to currently.
Please vote against the #AHCA in the Senate! It will literally kill Americans!
Support improvements not repeal. Do not support exemptions for Congress from the damage being done to constituents 45242
It will pass the Senate. McConnell hate "Obama"
Pls support coverage for preexisting conditions, mental health parity,access to healthcare for those who need it. improvements not repeal.
promise us that you won't settle for a meaningless "gimme" on opioids treatment. It's not enough. We NEED you.
It's real simple. Remove all House provisions. Ensure healthcare insurance is NON-PROFIT, no cadillac tax for group insurance. DM me 4 more
Senate must preserve medicaid expansion, pre-existing coverage, no age price penalties. @OHDems @oh3voters @SenSherrodBrown
I hope this holds true.  Please, for those in Ohio that you work for, VOTE NO! Call it what it is TRUMPdoesntCARE #voteno
Please vote NO
Do you have a town hall or time frame for your constituents?
Yeah, 15th of Never at Coward oâ€™clock, in Hoping Youâ€™ll Forget by 2022 auditorium.
Thank you for this stance. What we have is far from perfect, but let's be prudent & careful to not throw the baby out with the bathwater.
If insurance companies bailed on ACA what entices them to board #45's plan?  Shady stuff here. I do not believe low ded and better coverage
Please vote no on this inhumane bill.
just following orders
Please tell us you are focusing on the entire mess.  How are ins co going to be eager to cover those it ran from?  This makes no sense.
Does that mean you're voting against it? Please oppose this bill.
Who the heck can read that tiny print?
how about the government get completely out of healthcare and let insurance companies work across state lines? I think that would be best
Thank you for looking out for what is best for your constituents.
I hope you hold to this and are better than your house counterpart. Bill Johnson let Ohians down today.
Hold out for a plan that protects Ohioans--especially those with pre-existing conditions. Don't leave this up to the state. #VoteNoAHCA
Vote NO!
This won't do. Major provisions for preexisting conditions needed not paltry 8 billion over 5 years. GOP will pay for this abomination.
^Opiod^
Don't forget how it will punish those with preexisting conditions, the elderly, the poor, etc. Thanks @DaveJoyceOH14 for voting no.
None of this matters to me. I have pre-existing conditions. I can't afford $25K/yr premium with $75K/yr deductible. I'm a dead man walking.
I just hope you're not lying. We will find out and hold out accountable.
Thank you.
what about poor Ohioans on Medicaid who aren't part of the opioid crisis? How will they earn your protection?
not a strong enough response to what yr colleagues did today. not just addicts who will be screwed by this. when will we see u 2 discuss??
Thank you. I feel there is action to take to help the ACA succeed that is not repeal and I hope you consider that.
You'd best believe that I'll be calling you to make sure you don't waiver. Lord knows you are easily swayed by big donations. Remember DeVos
You MUST oppose.
It won't matter how many insurance companies there are if you have a preexisting condition.
our grandkids and great grandchildren are already on the hook for over 120 trillion in waste,fraud an corruption.Full Repeal
I'm 56 yrs old and refuse the government socialist healthcare. I refuse to purchase any government mandated insurance
@PatTiberi has gotten too comfortable. Cushy jobs you guys have...at the expense of the constituents you refuse to hold townhalls with.
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
RINO!!! GET OUT OF MY PARTY NOW!!!
So you'll be voting against the bill?
Thanks,
.@senrobportman Thank you, Senator! We Ohioans will continue to hold you to this. 
#VoteNoAHCA
Before ACA my daughter's individual policy went from $185 to  $300 in a few years because of a minor skin condition. Do the homework.
It is vitally important that you vote NO on the inhumane, poorly thought out, expensive, cruel AHCA.
well,Rob, you've got a tax-payer funded 11 day vacation & your constituents have some very real concerns. Any town halls scheduled?
Thank you Sen. Portman for standing up against the failures in this bill. Your vote needs to match your words though.
What about seniors getting charged a fortune under the House plan.  No thoughts on that at all?  You are just evil
If you vote against it, thank you.
Thankyou for the statement..people over politics..remember that.
You and your colleagues are put on notice:  you must not pass this bill.  Your future employment depends on it.
Being a woman is now a preexisting condition. Jimmy Kimmel's baby is now a preexisting condition. Rape is now a preexisting condition.
Rob couldn't care less. He's on cruise control until 2022. All he has to do is breathe.
@RepSteveChabot already sealed his fate. Your next campaign may be further away but we will remember how you vote on this issue
I hope to see your vote in the No column on this one. There are many scared people today thanks to the House vote.
Medicaid expanded coverage recipients are important. Better is for these to find jobs and good coverage. Medicaid is lousy coverage.
Please vote no. Improve Obamacare with coverage for ALL!
How would you incent new entrants to insurance markets while reducing the rate of insurance cost growth? Paul Ryan's magic competition wand?
All we can hope is that in the absence of substantial favorable modifications to this bill that your stance remains firm for Ohio.
No cuts to Medicare/Medicaid and pre-existing conditions must be covered for ALL.
