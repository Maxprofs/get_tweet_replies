GOP constantly cries about "unnecessary regulations." Can you please provide the examples & why they are unnecessary?
Fed-dot forcing all truck drivers to use e-logs. All so they can watch you. 
Will just slow everything down and raise prices.
So truck drivers should just keep driving even if they're too tired to be behind the wheel? & what's wrong w/ tracking a shipment?
E-log will affect any pickup the company owns that is over 10k gvw
So guys that work a 12 hour shift technically can't drive a back to hotel
Stop thinking only about dismantling regulations before taking into account how ALL people will be affected.
The ACA is unnecessary regulation that isn't needed..... Repeal to have open market.... No replace
Yeah, that free market thing was working out so well.  My premiums went from 300 in 2002 to 900 in 2008 and are now 1200 per month with less
And the more the government gets involved the premiums will raise higher and higher. Regulation is not the answer
One thing that we as a country need to realize this the golden rule is he who has the gold makes the rules
Combined together we have more gold
But not a "Heath care" bill that is a a giant tax cut for wealthiest that strips essential services to most vulnerable
Portman, you're a disappointment.
FDA now inspecting wineries using food processing based GMP's. Superfluous, and duplicate of Liquor regulation. http://www.facebook.com/FreeTheWineries 
We also need healthcare! Affordable Healthcare! Not yet another tax break for the wealthiest among us!
Get the FDA out of wineries, Now inspecting using Food GMP's. Wine has no history of food safety issues.
I'd like to be "unburdened" from taxes, too. We call must pay fair share, though. It's just common sense.
You own this #StopTrumpCare
#Ohio should not be burdened with leg. leaders who accept bribes and slavishly follow party lines wo considering constituent wellbeing

If Congress wants to keep the individual insurance market stable, it may not actually be such a heavy lift.

How can you talk about eliminating protections and protecting on the same page? Stop the double talk and fight for Ohio!
Why not advocate for single payer then?  Businesses would not have to provide healthcare and their workers would be healthier.
We do not need tax breaks for the wealthy. #TrumpcareKills
You mean #BigBiz? In an economy where businesses are expected to look out for their shareholders, govt needs to look out for the people.
Then stop being a big government progressive Republican!!!!
I'm voting a straight Democrat ticket in 2018 because this administration is the worst ever. Collusion with Russia and handouts to the rich.
Try repealing ACA
As a small biz owner, I am weary of having dubious public policy advanced in my name.
I'm going to agree as well.  In my industry, regulations make it easier to keep safety to my employees & environment a priority.

Hey, @senrobportman - My aunt worked years at the Golden Lamb! Old & relies on safety net. Please #ProtectOurCare and #VoteNo on #Trumpcare
Never provide details just idiot talking points. no credibility
Along with Hcare Ins,should have been done 1st 100.Incompetence!Had 8 yrs to plan.Incredible lack of leadership/execution. @realDonaldTrump
Yay!  Pollution and rip-offs from big banks!  I feel the "choices", "freedom", and "greatness headed our way!
We need policies to bolster middle class and poor. Trickle down has been debunked. Ultra rich don't help; system weighted to favor them.
vote to keep medicaid and zero tax cuts for the rich.. they don't need it the poor do
We should not be burdened everyday with a mentally ill president. What we really need is a new one.
But don't throw labor or consumers out with bathwater. You may get your donations from businesses, but (for now) you get your votes from us.
#Ohio needs a senator who will put country and state above party politics.
Can we talk instead about maintaining important #ConsumerProtections ?
My definition:
PROTECTIONS = regulations
REMOVE ACA= revolution
REPLACE W/TRUMP-RYANCARE= evolution
NO TO TAX CUTS.
YES TO ACA FOR ALL!

I find it comical, in a disgusting way, how they think 35% tax.is too high, but the bonuses of the top 4 or 5 executives are higher.
Drain the swamp of lobbyists and self serving rich white men.  Elect people whose mission is to truly serve all Americans.
We need regulation to limit how many dollars lobbies can contribute to campaigns.
We need regulation to stop the Madoffs of wall street from robbing  the trusting of their life savings.
Wave bye bye to those "cumbersome" regulations also.
We need regulation to keep our water clean and our breathable. Remember the 70s?
Tax reform would be great if it balanced the wealth distribution.  You spew tax cuts for all, but you really mean for the too 1%.
Sir, unlike you, people with souls would rather leave a better world to their children and understand thus regulations are necessary
No tax reform until we know in detail how Pres Trump & family would benefit. Pres must release taxes!
no tax reform until @realDonaldTrump releases tax returns. @SenSherrodBrown
Middle class needs the tax relief. Enough relief for businesses. They are rich enough!
SEVEN (7) Years!
Workers need protection as well @senrobportman. Great idea remove the burden of #healthcare form biz with #SinglePayer
We need regulations to protect us from your grifter president.We need health care.  We need to close loop holes and make the rich pay taxes


According to the SBA
Sole proprietorships 13.3% small partnerships 23.6% small S corpface 26.9 small C corp17.5 percent. OH tax 0%. Me 26%
Why yes! 
Let's just do away with all the land. And the waterways. And the sea.  And the wildlife. And the air. Have fun dying everybody!
Fraud.
And a responsible health care plan
You know what would help small biz owners? Single payer. Easier to quit and start new biz + easier to compete for employees w/o ins costs.
FIFY

#Smallbiz v #Ohio ne dolzhen byt' obremenen nenuzhnymi pravilami iz Vashingtona. Nam nuzhna #TaxReform & Reg Reform
Can you hear us Rob? Let's talk about healthcare. We are from Cincinnati. Roebling bridge.
In other words, give more to the very wealthy on the backs and health of the less fortunate.
This is all a talking point shift from healthcare.  Pressure still on u to do the right thing for Ohioians who need Medicaid extension.
Hmmm...i think we need to eliminate treason from our governments - let's try that.
Can you name any of these 'unnecessary' regulations, or is it just 'any and all'?
Is this code for tax cuts for the rich? We need to focus on middle and working class income.
How bout you speak out against unnecessary regulations on my body instead! As a small biz owner, I WANT regulations to protect common good
If your idea of "tax reform" is making sure your rich friends pay less...you know the answer Robbie: "HELL NO"! Do your job-represent US!!!!
Why don't you tell us some specific regulations instead of just being vague rob?
How about healthcare reform!! Repeal and replace!  Do your job! #VoteThemOut
Tax reform at the expense of 23 mill w/o healthcare?? That's what you are asking?Tell us. e are not stupid. @OhioDistrict3 @CbusIndivisible
Sick of the tired small business rhetoric. Tax reform only helps big corporations.  You sir are a sell out.
To bad you couldn't listen to the disabled who wanted to speak to you.  Like how your stormtroopers treated them?
We need tax reform but just back from China, we absolutely need environmental protection. I want a clean environment and will vote for it.
republicans hate regulations -- unless they involve Americans' crotches
We need #Healthcare reform, moving on already... 1 thing at a time.
#RepealDontReplace 
Citizens want freedom from fedgovt overcontrol.Get fedgovt out of healthcare!
@SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP
Daily reminder:  What @GOP call regulations are actually employee, consumer and environmental protections.
They're going to destroy Lake Erie. The Burning River Fest will actually be around a burning river again.
Meanwhile...the president wants to partner with the Russians and create some super cyber security.   All is well (sarcasm).
We need clean water, clean air, and safe workplaces. 

Stop putting profit before people.
...and we all need AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE. Do the rich need another tax break?
You are setting up a reason to explain away taking away affordable healthcare in a really transparent way.
'Reform'. Yeah right, Robert.
The GOP vision of Tax Reform is simply a scam to get tax breaks for the rich. Screw that. They should pay their fair share: More, not less.
We need Senator reform. You're terrible at this. #WeWillReplaceYou
#REALTownHallNOW
#NoCutsNoCaps
#NoBCRA
#FixTheACA
Wrong priority! WE THE PEOPLE need Heathcare NOT Wealthcare! Support your constituents! Millions will lose care&THOUSANDS will die. VOTE NO!
We know you don't work for small businesses or the people.  You are pushing an agenda that will benefit corporations and the rich.
Should a business be allowed to pollute the water we drink?  Should they be allowed to pollute the air we breathe?
what do you consider a small biz? Some owners pay less taxes than the employees. Hold a town hall. Lets talk abt these issues
Just stop.
Aka cover stmt for bigtax breaks for rich on the backs of middle and poor class..,here we go
Selling out to your overlords Senator! There's nothing more important than the traitor in the White House. GOP think nothing's wrong?
FLAT TAX.   CASH ACCOUNTING.  ONE DEDUCTION.
You are spinning a tale.
Key word is "unnecessary." Clean water is necessary. Safety is necessary. Fairness is necessary. Accountability is necessary. OHIO!
First we need a Sen/HofR that will protect us from Trump/Putin and PortmanCare. Seriously, how can you stand by and enable the disaster?
WE NEED SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE
Sure, let's let Opioid Co.flood the market with "OpioidsForAll!" & let the Oil Co drain their waste into the Cuyahoga River & CEO's make$$$
But consumers need to be safe and have confidence in what we buy. And it would be great if we didn't ruin the environment.
How much have you collected from the Koch Brothers for killing clean air and water
Come 2 Israel to compare tax reform & business developm like then-Gov Spence & others do. Be in touch for mission details.
Personally I don't think we should be burdened by you and your obvious partisan beliefs that will only harm is.
Don't bow to the #Leftist - you did with #Medicare FYI my friend doesn't work - could/should work - doesn't pay a dime for #insurance
If your staff cited specific regs hurting genuine OH small businesses maybe you could convince your constituents.
Dont you mean tax cuts for the rich & polluters, employee abusers, food contaminators, soon-to-be-legal financial criminals?
I am a constituent. This is code for trickle down,  or trickle up. Funneling $$ from the peasants to the swamp monsters. Who are u fooling
And we shouldn't be burdened by you pretending to represent us while you pander to special interests.
Every politician panders to special interests
Rob's "special interests" should be his constituency
So why don't you and Trump release your tax returns??? Who is really benefitting from reforms?
is the end of NAFTA?   Inc oats tax from Canada to make cheerios?   Decrease oil export tax to fund oil exploration ind?
We should not be burdened by a pres who is taking us backwards making us less safe,less healthy, less solvent so he can make the rich richer
Revolution=fast
Evolution=slow
Revolution=cleanse w/war
Evolution=cleanse w/economics.
You DO believe in EVOLUTION, don't you.
NO TAX CUTS!
The other problem is that the tax cuts proposed in the budget come at the expense of things many people really need. Please thinks this thru
If companies hire and retain employees, provide health care at high  levels, etc., they get a cut. If they lay off people, they lose the cut
So stop talking about it and start working.All talk-no action!
By tax reform you mean taking from the poor and giving to the rich like the republican healthcare act? Goodbye house in 2018!
Here's a thought - tie a jobs program to actual jobs. if you want to cut tax rates, why not create real incentives that help people?...1/2
And, #SmallBiz taxes should not be used to support drug addicts and your asinine #CARA w/o a wall to stop cartel drug flow from Mexico!
Oh just stop Rob.
I wish Twitter had a "laughing hysterically" button!
Regulations create jobs and keep us safe. Less regulations make all of us less safe. Remember that while representing me.
@senrobportman doesn't get it and won't do the right thing! It's all about pleasing his campaign contributors!
Regulations aren't "job-killing." Legit mom-and-pop small businesses could use some help, but the stuff that's been done so far is a joke.
Regulations on food, sanitation, safety and environmental are good for workers and society as a whole.
nonsense...NO TAX CUTS. The businesses and jobs are dissolving and RICH won't fund the U.S.A. in 15 years. THEY WANT OUT NOW. NO DENIAL!
Unnecessary regulations? Why do I feel any axed regulation will hurt the 99% of us, while helping corporations? Oh - because recent history.
And past history. It's like we're stuck on a carousel of idiocy.
Tax reforms should not hurt low & middle income families by taking away their deductions for earned income credit & head of household
Corporate American benefits from deregulation. It allows them to run amok over the pesky clean air, wild life, and good water.#coward
Small businesses have pass through taxation and rates haven't increased by any measure in 20 years. Propaganda.

No picnics today?
You really, really, really don't understand how upset your constituents are, do you? Or, is it you do and you couldn't care less?
Clean air, clean water, fire codes, lead paint removal... those sort of pesky regulations?
The Cuyahoga River ain't gonna burn by itself.
So grow a pair and get it done. You can start with #FullRepeal
There were those in London who thought some regulations were "unnecessary" and the result was a towering inferno with catastrophic results!
Excellent point!
example of an *unnecessary* regulation?
Name the regulations we're burdened with? Having to pay minimum wage? Unable to dump waste down the sewer? Come on. We're not burdened
We NEED representatives who will face us and hear us- so we are voting you out in 1947 days. #UnseatTheSellout #TownHallNow #TalkIsCheap
Is the tax reform you want to give in the healthcare bill you refuse to address?
Is healthcare one of those "unnecessary regulations"?
We need a senator who is honest with us. We deserve better than your broken record of tweets about everything but healthcare. Do your job!
Don't forget @realDonaldTrump and #RussiaGate . Not one word. Not a single word.
