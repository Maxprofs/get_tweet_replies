How are you going to vote on DeVos? Your stream indicates a genuine care for people. Hope that includes America's children.
.@senrobportman @Habitat_org much like you want @POTUS to listen to you, your constituents urge you to #DumpDeVos. Will you listen?
If you vote yes on DeVos you will prove you can tweet but you cannot listen
Do not support DeVos. Stand with Trump and you will eventually have to stoop. He wants only servants.
I'm glad you're helping habitat for humanity but there is still time for you to change your mind and vote NO ON #DeVos!
$50000 to betray children of Ohio -we will remember. Don't sell your constituents out for $$ Get a backbone. Find some ethics

Call: (202) 224-3353
If you value the children of Ohio - oppose DeVos.A radical and will destroy our education system instead of improving it.
Are you proud to sell out the children of Ohio?

you are corrupt! Listen to your constituents & vote as your constituents wish! #NoDevos & stop being a lap dog of the potus
.@senrobportman "I jeopardized the national education system by voting for #DeVos, but hey, I did it for $51,000! That's like, 3 zeroes!"
why would you support #DeVos? She is unqualified she owes Ohio over 5 million in fines. Did she buy your vote? $51k?
.@senrobportman Admirable sentiment. Why is your Columbus office phone "not in service"?
The bigger issue is how you've been bought by DeVos. Don't throw away Ohio's and the US' childrens' future!!!
