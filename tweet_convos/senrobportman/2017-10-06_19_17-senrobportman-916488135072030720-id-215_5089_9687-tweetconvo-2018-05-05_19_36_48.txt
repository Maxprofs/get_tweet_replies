AJax walked and stole second.

And he knew he was the winning run before he hit third. #RallyTogether
.@Yan_AGomes knew before he hit first. #RallyTogether
Brothers don't shake hands ... Brothers gotta hug! #RallyTogether
Great job blowing a 2-0 series lead!
Do you know the average state and local tax deduction for Ohioans is $10,444? That puts a couple thousand dollars in middle class pockets.

L
blew a 3-1 lead
Blew an 8-3 lead
Blew a 2-0 lead
ouchhhhhhhhhhh
Don't think Kluber going to struggle again
Our team is the greatist team ever love love 
Yankee Nation had heart burn all night. Great throw to erase their hopes and monster clutch hitting in the 13th.
Maybe a record number of deleted FB and Twitter posts bragging about how they were coming back home with the series tied after that 8-3 lead
Indians in 3.
Oh man
Finish the Yanks  off Sunday!!!
Sports are fun Sen. Portman: we have learned that the NRA paid You $3MILLION dollars from weapon sales! You make XLG profit from weapons #LV
Guys I will never ever forget this moment the rest of my life! Go Tribe! #RallyTogether
TRIBE FANS FOREVER!!!!!

Frankiebaby What a grand slam is What. Praying for Edwin
Beautiful comeback, from the 5th.

#RallyTogether
And you know what? We won on Kluber day
Yankees fans: They must have payed the umps for Lonnie's bat getting hit. The manager had a chance to challenge, but didn't. Go Tribe!
Joe girardi u owe your fans, your players and the entire organization a strong apology and please resign at end of year.
Way to go TRIBE!!!   WINDIANS are 2-0 in ALCS!!!
That's ALDS, not ALCS!!  My bad 
Believe  #RallyTogether
Such an epic comeback!
I tweeted this 9 minutes before it happened.   #YanVP
BRUUUUCCCEE!
Kluber should be well rested if needed.   But he won't be.
DIGNO HIJO DO BRASIL!!!!!
The most bizarre playoff game i can remember. Roll #tribe!
Awesome @Yan_AGomes just freaking Awesome!!  #RallyTogether
I love you
@MLB @fieldsmatt7
congratulations!
Congratulations!
‘Like’ doesn’t describe my love for @Indians & this win. #GoTribe!
#FuckTheYankees Sweep em for Boston, Cleveland!
Dude my heart. Holy shit
I mean I can't even pretend to believe that the Sox have a chance. So as long as the Yankee's are out as well I'm happy.
Hahaha I’ve had years like that, i feel ya. Hopefully you’ll get to party with us on Sunday!
Well I mean unless the Sox tie it I wont be :(
Consolation party? :/
A #FuckTheYankees party
Yessir!! If nothing else, think how shitty they feel rn. Blew a 5 run lead after chasing Corey fuckin Kluber.
Amazing game!!!!!!!  Go Tribe!!!!!
Yanimal FTW What an amazing game this was #RollTribe
Lindor best player .. Puerto Rico represent ..

No good pitching by the Indians
You guys are playing "Tubthumping" right now, aren't you?
It hit the knob of the bat, gift win  2-0 is 2-0 though
That’s right Yankees. There’s a new sheriff in town. You and your judge can just hit the road.
Thank you for exposing Girardi
Give us hammie pls
Can you at least feel for me
Great f’ing game.
You are the dream team!! #rolltribe #ClevelandProud #RallyTogether #SpankTheYanks #windians
Guys. The Yankees thread is 90% blaming Joe. It's hilarious. 
congrats on a great win
You can thank Giraldi for the gift, send all gifts to wherever the fuck he ends up next year, but it won’t be here in New York. 
Amazing game, amazing finish! #PostSeason2017 getting really interesting.  #Indians vs #Yankees battle for 13 innings.
..no, let's go 2the BRONX.. #NYC #PinstripePride 

I hate this umpire because he basically gave away 4 runs but GG didn’t enjoy the series hope to never do it again have fun in Houston 
#believeland windians
WHAT. A. GAME. Everyone loves a walk-off win. Good job, boys. #Indians #WINdians #WorldSeriesWahoos
Congrats gentlemen! Salute! 

It's 4:30 in the morning here in Paris; I stayed up to listen to the end of the game and I regret absolutely nothing.

Cleveland vs the world!!


That was awesome!!!! These guys are the real deal!
Lol I'm done. Time to focus on NHL and NFL. Please fucking sweep us, I will credit you for getting Girardi fired.
You won by a bad call by the umps. Congratulations
#Circumstances
LETS GOOOOO
The MVP of the game: Yankees reply guy.
#firegirardi send him a thank you card
We want Hammy
Can we please get a @Yan_AGomes gif of his pickoff and walkoff? All I know is Yan went off and won us this game!
#DontPitchToYan
Really?
You guys can thank our shitty manager for that game. Gotta give credit to you guys though.
#DontRunOnYan #DontLeadOffOnYan #DontPitchtoYanWithTheGameOnTheLine
Omg excited called it b4 the 13th started:)
Yyyyyyaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnn!!! #RallyTogether

Yea u got lucky calm down
THIS IS FOR YOU EDWIN ENCARNACION!!!
TEAM EFFORT PERFECTION
WHAT A COMEBACK!!
#RallyTogether
Feels like the 90s again, never out of it
let this walk off not distract you from the fact that you guys blew a 3-1 lead last year to the cubs and could do it 2 years in a row 
At least we made it to the playoffs
at least we didn't blow a 3-1 lead and have back 2 back world series 
We're talking about this year, not last year.
Thank Giradi
Did the Indians win or the Yankees lose?
This team is wonderful
Embarrassing loss
#windians
Oh my! That was an amazing baseball game. The guys should be proud because us fans are proud of our #Windians

Amazing game!! What a battle
Great win!
That was just incredible. I'm in Tennessee, listening to a distant 1100 AM, watching a lagging Gamecast, and cheering the Tribe! Win!!!!!!!!
YAN GOMES DO BRASIIIIL

And you're still stuck in Cleveland . Lucky you ...
And at last Kluber gets the run support he deserves. Topped off by his trusted catcher. LOVE IT!!
#Windians
actually youre going to NY
I hope you make it back to the WS just to lose it again
Gomes had a great game. The pick off from his knees was classic. 
Hell yeah!
One thing left to do!!!!
You guys still have to watch the Browns on Sunday #staywoke #Yanksin5
Oh the sound of haters scrambling to delete their previous tweets! Love it!

Thank you, for Bruce again! 
Thanks for Ryder Ryan 
Lol of course 
Tough one, guys but we pulled it off!!! #RallyTogether
Incoming yankee fans complaining about umpires
Could’ve avoided a grand slam if the ump knew what hit by pitch means
Reply man, just like how the ump missed the call on the pickoff to second. Called reply

Sweet ass long game, but hell yeah, it's ours!
What else could he possibly do? Guns out two and the game-winning hit!!!
Yyyyyyyyaaaaannnnnkeeeessss...Don't win! Yaaaaaaannnnkkkkeeeess...Don't win. Go @Indians!

What an electric game! I remember the '86 Mets/Astros NLCS well. Listened to the last 9 innings parked in Union Square in SF! #RallyTogether

I got this before the game finished on the TV! You spoiled it for me!
Why were you on Twitter instead of watching the game? Lol
I got the notification before it ended. My phone was off
Don't look at your phone until the game ends
Once you get the notification, you can’t not look
Sure. Lol
