there should be no doubt where you stand on education and DeVos, but you keep ignoring us. Do so at your political peril.
45415 Too bad you haven't been a strong supporter of #Ohio constituents recently & vote NO on DeVos #NoDeVos #Ohioiswatching
Well there IS doubt, @robportman because all you have done is talk or tweet. What ACTION are you going to take to address it?
Supporting her. 2/2. Check website. Then spent wknd sending innocuous tweets, ignoring constituents.
How about #EducationCrisis in US? Go after multimillion dollar tax dodgers.
"The very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world. Lies will pass into history.” Orwell. Is this your legacy?
@14thV Please do something.
...and by something, I did not mean vote it favor of Betsy  DeVos!
Please explain this to Mr Trump.
there is doubt when senators don't pressure @POTUS to stand up to #Russia Demand action #russianhacking
i am a proud supporter of Ohio School Children. There should be no doubt that Betsy Devos should ever become S Of Education
yes. Absolutel. Now vote no to DeVos #ivote
I wish you weren't a supporter of that ridiculous Betsy DeVos. Rethink this decision, sir! Listen to your constituents!
What are you doing insofar as "standing with Ukraine"? TWEETiNG?
There should be no doubt it's #ruSSiaINVADEDUkraine, not a "Ukraine Crisis." #putinKILLs #ruSSiaLIES
@Hogan80Hogan Unfortunately, there is great doubt because of the man leading your party.
Your constituents - you know, we Ohioans you purport to represent - deserve to know what you intend to do about it!
Bruh, how tone deaf are you? Speak to your constituent issues, not tertiary bullshit.
Yes, now back this up. Pleased to see Ambassador Haley's statement too. But POTUS is saying USA = thuggery of Putin.
Doubt will remain as long as DJT is in charge. Please vote no on Devos.
'Russia is the Motherland of Crimea.The 18th Century.1954.2014.'
@senrobportman #Russia #Crimea
See if you can get @POTUS  on board with you, Rob.
Then let the President know how you feel about Ukraine!
. @senrobportman when will you and @GOP stand up to influence/control by Russia's FSB in our government?
words, words, words, deep concern, grave concern, words, words...
Please speak those words to the Republican Administration, who cozies up to Russia & tries to establish a moral equivalency.
But not of the American public school system. Please reconsider your vote.  Disabled kids need IDEA. My daughter needs IDEA
the current administration surely casts doubt.  It appears clearly that there IS doubt.
Then be a strong supporter of public education too. Charter schools are failing miserably in Ohio. Vote NO on DeVos.
#TaketheDeVosPledge    I've taken the pledge. Vote for Devos and I will donate money to your opponent--and vote for him/her.
maybe you should be a supporter of public education #boughtbyDevos
There is huge doubt because Putin may have #Trump over the barrel. #Ukraine #UkraineCrisis #ImpeachTrump
not all support nazis and war!
Do you think Trump has any doubts? What have you actually done about this? Talk is cheap.
agree!  Now, #DumpDevoss
how about our children? #NotoDeVos
Now, if only you would oppose DeVos, despite the $50K+ contribution.  Do the right thing ALL of the time!
that's nice, but where do you stand on @BetsyDeVos ?
Republican made it easier to keep Big Oil payments to foreign govts a secret. foreign payments from Putin's Rosneft to Trump.
thank you for your stance.
where do you stand on Trump's dangerous and demagogic attacks on the federal judiciary?
so, where is your support for Ohio: renewable energy jobs, education #noDeVos, fair election funding #noPACs?
I'm surprised you can stand at all without a spine.
what about our public education ? DeVos is unqualified to run our education system!

Do you not find a vote for #Tillerson to be contrary to supporting #Ukraine?
You have yet to actually stand up to Trump on anything beyond these tepid words. You are ignoring constituents. Shame on you.
WAKE UP AND LISTEN TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS!!!!!
would it not follow you would investigate Russia's actions during Presidential election? Like interferencenin Ukraine.
#dumpdevos #portmanhasnospine

is like all Russian leaders dont want peace in this http://world.wtf !
support Trump's cabinet particularly DeVos we will defeat you
care to support women's rights and #standwithPP ? women should have the right to choose & defunding #PP is not the answer!
vote NO on DeVos!
I bet none of tour constituents believe you should vote for  Devos.  VOTE NO!!!
. Please tell the so called president that. And don't vote for Sessions or Devos.
Vote NO on Devos. Listen to your constituents.
Props for having the guts to differ with out new President on this. Don't let him bully you and other Republicans on anything
Interested in what you're prepared to do about it.
It would be nice if you supported our children's education as much as you do the Ukraine and the $51 thousand DeVis gave you
VOTE AGAINST Devoss and I will believe you think independently!!
You're a little off topic here.  If you vote for Mrs. Amway, you will be OUT! How much money did she give you???  Sellout!
THIS is a worth fight.  Did @POTUS return your call on standing up to ?
Don't have $51,000 right now but can we set up a payment plan to buy back your vote for Devos? Sincerely, your constituants.
then you better vote like it.
There's SIGNIFICANT doubt where the US stands! Secret, unrecorded phone calls last week between Putin and Trump. Come on,man!
If you support Ukraine then you need to speak up to Trump not twitter.He is doing nothing but supporting Russia in destroying
then investigate why Russia's attacks on Ukraine escalated after Trump's phone call with Putin. If only they kept recording.
where's your pride in regards to public education? Invite to the real world classroom in OH still stands!
I appreciate your stance on #Ukraine. That of the @realdonaldtrump @potus administration is not clear. #UkraineCrisis.
Vote NO on DeVos please.
.@senrobportman It's great you stand with #Ukraine. How about all the Ohioans who are begging you to listen to them on DeVos, Bannon, etc?
but are you a strong supporter of public education? #noDevos
do you support public ed? I'm thinking not. Your fat wallet, via @BetsyDeVos means more than our kids. #shameful #NoToDevos
no trust, you back someone like Devos. Wish I could trust you to hold Russia accountable but it seems everything has price.
.@senrobportman Excellent. Then support an independent commission to investigate Russian interference in 2016 U.S. election.
as of now you're all talk no action. @SenateGOP needs to be tougher with your president
Then stop giving Putin's puppet everything he wants and get Bannon off the Security Council.
still no response to Betsy DeVos. Vote no to support good education in our country!
Your boss' tax returns may reveal otherwise, if we could see them.
but there is doubt bc trump turned off the recording during his conversation with Russia  please sir, help our country
Tell your President and vote no on DeVos for the children.
Of course. So natch you will call on president to disclose Russian interests & for him and family to divest all conflicts
how about you stand up for public education. VOTE NO on DeVoss!
Your stance will change on this too, as soon as a Trump donor finds the right price. #noDevos
Says who?  We have no policy on #Ukraine.  @RealTrump2016 is in bed with Putin.
I agree with your stance but please also support the education in the US. No appointment for DeVos
agree with this statement. But I do not agree with your decision to support DeVos. #noDevos #district12
Your support of DJT brings significant doubt as to where United States and you stand.
try being a strong supporter of public schools #NotoDeVos
thanks Senator! It's time to put RUSSIANs On NOTICE!  Rob Portman gets my Ohio Senator of the Day Award! Next- No On DeVoss!
Your president lies about what’s going on in #Ukraine. Why do you back him so strongly?
there is great doubt, because we have a leader who you and others are afraid to stand up too. Talk is cheap.
.@senrobportman We're having our own #Constitutionalcrisis here!
There is no doubt.  @realDonaldTrump has clearly said that #Russia is “not in #Ukraine.” How to reconcile with your support?
did you go vacation with that $51k DeVos gave you? Buy a new house? Glad you can be bought so cheaply.
You can't be serious. STOP TWEETING COWARD. I personally will fight to keep you from being re-elected. I am an Ohioan.
we know where you stand on this. Now respond to the overflowing correspondence from constituency urging you to vote #NoDeVos
How much money did you get from DeVos family?
but u voted for oil companies to hide foreign payments and we R not proud of UR DeVos vote
do you stand with @SenJohnMcCain for the provision of defensive armaments like Javelin anti tank missiles to #Ukraine?
I wish you were a strong supporter of education. DeVos is a disaster. Support our children and our schools! #DumpDevos
you're 1 of the few GOPers I'm cool with. DJT may have hijacked OH but I wish you would back your words w/action
thanks Senator, now make a smart principled choice on Betsy DeVos! #DumpDevos
No on DeVos. Listen to your people.
too bad you're not a supporter of our public schools. $51k for our children's future.
And yet there is doubt because of unanswered and un-investigated questions about Trump Putin connection.
are you a supporter of education? Does it bother you that she owes OH 5mil or is you 51k enough to buy vote
How about showing students and teachers the same level of support and vote NO on DeVos! #noDeVos #PortmanForSale
please have that same passion when it comes to Betsy DeVos' vote. Our kids are counting on your "no" vote.
Oh sir but there is lots of doubt and that would be due to Der President's ties to Putin! NO ON DEVOS!! #EDUCATIONCRISIS #NO
Pretending to stand with #Ukraine while voting to put money in Russian Oligarch pockets is called RANK HYPOCRISY
@Ukrainolution @senrobportman Graham Trump is a Russian Oligarch !

#TheResistance
Tell Donald (YOUR PRESIDENT) if you think it won't get him in trouble with his Russian counselors
Tell that to Trump.
too bad you're not a supporter of public schools. Guess that $51k makes you biased. Vote no on Devos.
I note from the Senate record you voted to ok extraction industry bribery allowing Exxon et al to put money in Putin's pocket
wtf Mr Portman?
It's all about serving natural gas to Europe. Go ahead and spend our education and lives on uselessness. Get voted POTUS.
Agreed. We also need to be strong supporters of our children and public education. No on DeVos!
be a proud supporter of Ohio kids and education! Vote NO #devos   #sellout
please do not confirm incompetent secretary of education . your job is to listen to Ohio constituents not #noDevos
hope that 51k is enough to live on when your seat is up in 2022. #noDevos we will not forget!!!!
where do you stand on DeVos and education? You must not be a strong supporter of education is only reasonable conclusion.
you stand with #Ukraine or with #Trump you can do both. #PortmanForSale be a #senator From #Ohio and #stopbannon #district12
Please do not support Devos.  My disabled son and millions of other disabled kids deserve better.  Thank you
try being a proud supporter of Ohioan's education system first! The Ukraine must've been a campaign donor too!
your constituents are NOT proud of you! #DumpDevos #DumpPortman
Then please support investigation into Russian influence on this election.
There should be no doubt where our President stands either. He is way to cozy with Putin & you know it. Do Something!
-Akron
Supporting our children is just as important as supporting Ukraine.  Vote no on DeVos.
I hope your as committed to #Ukraine as you are my daughter.  Maybe you can send #DeVos to the Ukraine?
because... that'd be fine with me...
Good position but we need to hear about support #SocialSecurity & #Medicare. Have you seen #Pat Tiberi? He's wanted in #OH12
I appreciate your resolve on this and will be upset if it can be bought like with DeVos. No on DeVos!
How about being a strong supporter of public education in our Ohio and voting no on DeVos?
If only you were a strong supporter of your constituents, rather than your fat cat donors and party bosses.
Don't care. #DumpDevos or you are done in OH.
.@senrobportman Yet there is a significant degree of doubt. With Trump in office making clandestine calls to Putin, how can there be trust?
can we trust you or is #PortmanForSale on foreign policy too?
Pray tell us where might that be?
you are right but with @PutinPuppet in the WH there is nothing but ambiguity coz high tech sanction relief and Oil Co bribes
and most, if not all of us are strong supporters of our childrens' schools. Tell us your view on DeVos - we won't stop asking
unfortunately, Devos bought Rob with her campaign donation! #WakeUpRob! #DumpDevos
And there should be no doubt on where you stand on DeVos. Vote NO Senator!
Thank You!
