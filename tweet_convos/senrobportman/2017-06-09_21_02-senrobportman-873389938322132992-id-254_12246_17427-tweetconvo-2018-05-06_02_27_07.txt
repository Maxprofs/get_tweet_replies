they kinda are iver
Yes they are @cavs
There over. Admit it.  
What if the cavs asked you to protect Medicaid and expand the ACA?  Would you still support the team?
@senrobportman
@JJHayes531 lightning to strike twice?
Great game! Awesome shooting! 
Thanks NBA refs for re-affirming why the NFL is better than the NBA. Refs control the action. Refs gave the cavs game 4. #refgate
Did the refs shoot 24 3-pointers?
no but you cant say it didnt help them in any way.
The refs sucked but the @cavs were unstoppable tonight.
^this. a few calls either way didn't change the game, the cavs going off in the first half did.
Please Watch http://youtu.be/u1xDNiw_ZV4 
New Video Just Dropped Hit That Button
Awesome team effort last night!

مبروك الانصاف @KingJames

ما يرد علي ليييييش لا يكون غير سنابه
مايهمه الماضي قد المستقبل
Warriors are going to blow a 3-0 lead 
Damn and y'all just lost 4-1
The Undefeated Streak of the @warriors has been conquered by the reigning, defending, undisputed champions.  @cavs @HeymanHustle
Brock isn't a champ at all a champ defends there title everyday
If you don't like it than go to the wwe borad and complan there not on the comments it gets really annoying to see people complaning.

GO CAV GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
If they win game 5 then its a series but not until then. If they win game 5 then they will win the series. GSs rim will look like a period.
@mitzi_sanz
GSW only had 9points lead. @cavs can do it. 137-116. Obviously.
Next year. Learn from it.  Grow from it.   Use it don't let it use you
@gfillypi HAHAHAHAHA BANDWAGON
Why was Draymond Green not ejected ?     I'm reminded of an old school song, "Something , Something just ain't right ! (Keith Sweat)"
They ain't over because it ain't Sunday yet.
Right on keep on pushing @cavs 
Cavs I have no hate and I think yipour a really good team but how do you defend the land when your versing the warriors at home?
#DefendTheLand #DefendTheLand
But it will be Monday!

Vamo arriba carajo, #DefendTheLand
The Cleveland cavaliers have healthcare.    Senators have health care. Ohioans should have healthcare.   Americans should have healthcare.
A team of Record Breakers  #DefendTheLand

Funny cause when we finally win they "is rigged for money" while the warriors won 3 games in a row we didn't say nun.
How does it feel for the game to be given to you by the refs. The refs really played well in game 4

@cavs you don't have DNA to be sportsman like; too much ego;
Biggest thing is the Cavs aren't giving up. Would have been easy to pack it in tonight.
