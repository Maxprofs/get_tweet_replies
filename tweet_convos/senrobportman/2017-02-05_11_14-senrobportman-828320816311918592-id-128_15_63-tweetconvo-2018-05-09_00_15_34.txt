People are trying to talk to you about the scourge of Betsy Devos.  Why aren't you listening?  #DumpDevos
when you repeal #ACA how are you going pay for tx? #publichealth #publiceducation will also help say no to #DeVos #Ohio
so agree,rehab is a fortune of money. Drug addiction &mental health totally ignored in US until it's a crisis.
yes mental health care needs accessible for all! Rob just wants to cut supply and forgets about the demand side
Everywhere you go in Ohio, your constituents are telling you to vote #nobetsydevos
You know what else people talk about??
Not about you that's for sure.
Invest in our public schools to help correct this problem.  Charter schools w/o oversight & for profit is a problem! #noDevos
people need insurance!!! Not block grants!!! Insurance as good as yours. Do u know how $ rehab is? 20,000!!
This is no joke.
Quality education helps with that.

Need anything else?
No to Devos! We know she donated to your election campaign. We will vote you out.
We also needs all hands on deck for public education, vote #nodevos. She is unqualified.
If you are truly listening to Ohioans, then you know your constituency wants you to #DumpDevos. Be strong. Vote no.
From Michigan, Thank You Sir
why? Because towns were ruined by corp raiders read Glass Houses- wake up addiction is hopelessness
Do you actually care about these things? Because voting for Betsy DeVos will commit more Ohioans to a life of poverty. #devos
We need strong schools to educate kids about the dangers of abusing drugs. DeVos will weaken our schools. Please oppose her.
I bet they also talk about how unqualified DeVos is too! #NotoDeVos #DumpDevos
I bet they also talk to you about saying #nobetsydevos Listen to your constituents!
six months in and #CARA has done nothing but expand our debt!
Wouldn't be a scourge if the border was secure.
what we need RIGHT NOW is a NO vote for Betsy DeVos! Please think about our kids and not your political war chest!!!
The children of those addicts need public schools to help raise them up and level the playing field.  Please reconsider Devos
the growth of Indian owned businesses that launder money, sex trade and sell opium must be investigated
Investigate opium brought in by Indian owned cash businesses, gas stations, conveinent stores, hotels and more
everywhere in OH people talk/call/email/tweet/post for you to listen to us about devos. Don't see you commenting on that 
what about your addiction to $$$ Rob? Sad that you can be bought. Ohio's kids and families deserve better than DeVos! #resist
you talk to people?! Do you listen to calls or read letters?!  I'm disappointed in my lack of representatio.  #noDevos
You keep selling out We the People and you'll see a whole lot more folks turn to drugs for comfort. That's a win, huh?
listen better, they say NO to DeVos.
@SenToomey https://www.change.org/p/press-robportman-com-demand-senator-rob-portman-resigns/w?source_location=petition_nav … #DumpDevos #StopDeVos
This is exactly why you need to cut taxes on the rich and eliminate affordable healthcare. Only then will addiction vanish!
Everywhere you go people are trying to tell you to help with that #StopDeVos #StopSessions #StopPruitt #StopPrice #resist
you know what else you hear?  NO on DeVos
never heard of CARA until i got on twitter, but encouraging you to vote NO to devos.
I've been trying to talk to you, but the phone line is busy! Vote No on DeVos, Price, Pruitt.
. More STEM schools! All for school choice
I respect your work on addiction. It is a really crisis.  But voting for DeVos will cause another crisis. Vote NO!
they are also asking you to stop the Sessions and DeVos nominations.  Thank you for your work on the addiction problems.
Can you hear us talking about the scourge of DeVoss? How about the scourge of the #muslimban   We are watching you in Ohio
every day you ignore thousands of Ohioans. 
Ohio wants you to vote NO on deVos. 
Don't sell our children out.

45415 Seems like #Ohio is loudly telling you to dump DeVos. #Ohioiswatching #CountryOverParty  #NoDeVos
Everywhere I go in Cincy OH I hear people saying how unqualified Betsy DeVos is to be Ed Secy. #PortmanStopDeVos
Voting to cut ACA will hurt Ohio healthcare incl. addict treatment. Listen to your constituents for once! #ACA #nodevos #Ohio
DeVos is not qualified even if she did donate to your campaign.  Stand up for what is right!
Or the scourge of having Devos as Secy. of Ed. #TaketheDeVosPledge
More likely they are talking about #VoteNoDevos and #noSessions
people are talking about you not answering/listening to consituents and 51k from DeVos!!!!No crooked politics!!!!NO DEVOS!!!!
.@senrobportman Everytime you post something online, people tell you to vote no on @BetsyDeVos Will you listen or will you sell out for $51k
the repeal of #Obamacare and roll back of Medicaid expansion will be detrimental to this cause in OUR state!
Including a Sec of Ed who understands how public education works!  No on DeVoss.
thete talking about your ties to Betsy DeVos. Start representing your constituents.
NH has a great model that is working.
everywhere you go, people are lining up outside your offices and calling full mailboxes to say #DumpDevos
Cowardly to focus ONLY on addiction, of course all Ohioans concerned, no controversy there. But- ACA, Education, etc...
Help fight addiction by supporting healthy educational practices and retract your support for DeVos #Ohio #CARA #STOPAct
You know what helps stop addiction? Quality public education. Are you with or against Ohio kids? Vote #NoOnDeVos. #DumpDevos
thanks for yet another informative #CARA tweet. Thoughts white nationalist blogger Bannon and his place on the NSC?
- You know what helps in the fight against opiate addiction? Education and health care! #DumpDevos #SaveACA
Oh, good. I didn't realize you actually came to Ohio to talk with your constituents. Can we plan a town hall?
As an Ohio resident with legitimate pain issues that I am prohibited from relieving because of medication abuse, I feel this
.@senrobportman And good public education can give students the info to help them avoid involvement with drugs! #DumpDeVos
yes addiction is a huge issue. So is education. Stop ignoring your constituents! No to DeVos! Public education is at risk.
right...Edu and keeping the #ACA could help with that. Ppl are also talking 2 u about #NotoDeVos but YOU DONT LISTEN!!!
Education is an important weapon in the fight against addiction. We need schools in this fight. #DumpDevos #SavePublicSchools
Your support of Trump's pirate cabinet is deplorable. Show OH you care about our kids! #DumpDevos #NoonDeVos
what about your DeVos vote. We will talk about that to get you out of the Senate.
not going to deflect us from your betrayal of our children.
there is such a thing as a recall. Perhaps we should start a discussion?
we need a Secretary of Education with experience. You sold out our kids for $51k.
And we need strong public schools! #NOtoDeVos !
want to address addiction, people need best education and DeVoss is not the answer. Vote no on DeVoss.
you really need to listen to the voices of those you represent. Or be voted out. #NotoDeVos
think about the role strong schools play in families and addiction. DeVos knows nothing. You sold out!
Hear us. No on DeVos or your claim to care about addiction is baseless. Good education is where we start. We won't forget
No, your constituents are trying to talk to you to vote NO on DeVos but her $$ are speaking volumes to you.  #saveourkids
start with education and and support our schools #PublicschoolProud. Find your moral core! Don't vote for DeVos #DumpDevos
When you travel Ohio, are you only meeting with party-friendly constituents? Suggest you listen to others, or get voted out.
@OHDems Ohioans are talking to you about voting NO on DeVos too. And you're ignoring them.
.@senrobportman @ohioaj They are also asking about Betsy DeVos and Jeff Sessions, but you are ignoring them. Stop ignoring your constituents
As the one GOP Buckeye on here - who put up signs for you all summer and fall - I say thanks, and please support Betsy DeVos!
What is it about Devos that makes you think she is qualified to run the Education Department?
All of the people who have destroyed education are united against her, like they were united against Trump.
destroyed education?   That's what we are fighting against.  She is ridiculously unqualified.
DeVos clearly more qualified than WJC's DOEd Sec Riley, and IMO better than Duncan by right stance on choice.
Duncan was a supt. for years.  You may disagree with his views but he was at least qualified.  Devos is just rich.
Expertise can harm when dir. is way wrong. Agencies, corps., even tech, may need a non-specialist to change.
if that's true then I should be secretary of defense.
ACA requires coverage for addiction services
let's  talk about a NO VOTE for DEVOS, SESSIONS & GORSUCH first.Time to listen to the 65 million popular voters !!
yea, yea, yea. Important topic, but what is happening to our democracy is more important. How about doing something.
have to give your tweetaide kudos today great tweeting to try to clear out the anti @BetsyDeVos tweets but we are watching
I'm sure they're also talking abt how strong public schools & public health are critical for PREVENTION. No DeVos, No Price!
while this is a very important issue, many of us want to know what you aren't going to do about the scourge of Betsy De Vos.
investigate trump - FOR TREASON!
everywhere that isn't your offices in CLE, Columbus, Cinci? Because here we have been talking about DeVos
Work a bit more diligently for the aborted babies who don't have a say in their future .
How many Ohioans have asked you to #DumpDeVos ? Educating our kids also requires all hands on deck!
chuck'n & jivin' is misdirection / no on DeVos / INVESTIGATE PUTIN-TRUMP / put country BEFORE party
Please VOTE NO ON DEVOS
Exactly. Don't rely on subjective pain assessment for Medicaid payback and you'll reduce oxy dependency
Agreed.  We also need a Sec of Ed that will #standup4publiceducation  Listen to Ohioans.  Read the letters! #nodevos
yes, this is extremely important. But we're also trying to talk to you about voting NO on Devos. Can you please listen to us?
right now all we are talking to you about is doing your job and voting NO on DeVos. Represent us. Not corruption.
If you were listening today, you'd hear the deafening sound of your constituents telling you to vote #noDevos #DumpDevos
YES. So please do not cut people off of Medicaid expansion. Please please do the right thing and stand up to this maniac.
