If #WorseCare passes, and clinics in rural America shutter their doors leaving 1000s of women w/out preventive care, you may change ur tune.
Please look at lesson of defunding planned parenthood in Texas. The results have been ugly for women's health there.
A level playing field, YES! Hardworking Ohioans w/ preexisting med conditions who diligently pay bills want one, too. No high-risk pools!
Please stand up for the most vulnerable in Ohio. Children, elderly, disabled need representation more than the uber-rich.
Rob's idea of tax reform is to give the business owners tax breaks and shifting the tax burden to the workers. Very regressive.
Small businesses use ACA to cover their workers. After Rob repeals, small businesses will again struggle to provide care for their workers.
Rob is hiding from Ohio voters in friendly manufacturing plants. What about the rest of Ohio, Rob? Rob is bad for Ohio. Bad for you.
But will you fight to keep health care for your constituents is the real question

No,  abortion services is a very small part of the services that PP provides.
PLEASE, please vote no...
How about fighting for a decent wage for all the #Ohioans who work for that company? Why do businesses get your help, but not people?
Last term for this guy!  He only votes whoever donates the most to him. That's who gets the vote
Regulatory relief that'll allow companies to despoil the environment, like Scott Pruitt is suggesting? Clarity please Senator.
Repeal Obamacare now
Start w @realDonaldTrump & @IvankaTrump They outsource ALL products to China (then get patents)& underpay women & children in sweatshops
Ohio really needs you to stand strong against @SenateMajLdr and not accept scraps for your vote! #44023
Everyday GOP just makes me more upset. Government should serve ALL Americans. Not just rich and influential. Not backing down on that!
We're a small biz against corporate welfare. Regs can be smart and necessary. Tax in Ohio is low! No tax cuts if it hurts poor!
You know who deserves a level playing field?  People who need health insurance!
We'd like you to START fighting for our healthcare.

If they're regulations that protect my health, safety and environment, let's keep 'em. Please be specific about what "regs" you mean!
The fact you cant stand up for the most vulnerable in Ohio proves you have no business calling yourself a United States Senator! #Trumpcare
Please vote no, Senator. This bill would be a loss for Americans.

Can you make sure the Health insurance field is level and vote NO on the bill in the Senate? #voteNO
You are never allowed to call yourself a Christian ever again!


Do we deserve a level playing field when it comes to healthcare?Or do the poor not matter to you? And do you realize that the poor vote?
Please consider voting against the @GOP health bill, will make it impossible for new startups leaving millions of Americans out in the cold.
Rob, I do not understand how you think you are representing Ohio. You need to get out of bed with the Trump rhetoric
no more subsidies we are broke.
Nice. Now, remember, to vote NO on the Senate #healthcare bill. And, while you're at it, work with Dems to fix what we already have.
How about leveling the playing field globally by expanding Medicaid?
That's all swell! Could you also fight against a dreadful health bill?
http://money.cnn.com/2010/03/23/markets/markets_newyork/index.htm …
what about fighting for healthcare for millions of Ohioans! How about that Rob?
all buckeyes deserve a level playing field. reject #GOPCare. removing $ from healthcare doesn't create better care, it creates sicker voters
Who cares about profits if we're dead?
Yes as do the hundreds of #Retreaders in #America but #trump allowed the #tariff to expire on #Chinese #trucktires
20% flat tax, One deduction -
Read a lot of your tweets. Surprising, not one about the bad health care bill.
WILL YOU FIGHT TO PROTECT OUR HEALTHCARE? PEOPLE OVER PARTY, BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL ACTUALLY DIE WITH THE TRUMPCARE PLAN. CAN U LIVE WITH THAT?
And a health care plan that provides coverage for people with pre existing conditions
Why would senators exempt themselves from the healthcare laws that apply to ordinary Americans? Worrisome. Please respond. At a town hall.
What about health care though?????
Small companies also need to be able to afford health insurance. No on the BRCA! Even the insurance companies hate it.
Let's make sure they are using regular employees as some companies in Portman's district fired the employees and now employee tmp laborers
Good goals, but healthcare must be your top priority. Quit fighting and start working with Republicans to at least repeal #Obamacare. #MAGA
They do, but given their employees are going to be bankrupt trying to pay for healthcare, why even care, right, senator?
He's getting a forehead tattoo of YES.
Will you fight for #healthcare level playing field? Please vote no on #BCRA . #healthcarenotwealthcare
You'll fight for a company but not the workers ability to have health insurance? #VoteNO on the Senate healthcare bill! #FixACA
We might as well put your picture here since you are helping them take away our healthcare! Quit being a coward&stand up for us!



Why are u so scared to hold a town hall?Are u scared to face the people who are going to lose their healthcare?Quit being a coward&face us!!
But b4 that,  you have the power to kill Trumpcare,  please do so.  Waiting for the press release...
I hope you stand up and fight for our healthcare which effects not only every Ohioan but every American. Except those of you in Washington
No to this despicable Senate healthcare bill.  It's 2017 and Price is insane thinking insurance can go back.  Not workable in any way.
Senator, can you please comment on this contradiction between what @VP Mike Pence says & what Gov @JohnKasich says??
Wow. GOP gov Kasich's office says @VP Pence is lying about his state's Medicaid expansion. It's an ugly lie, too:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/kasich-joins-ranks-of-gop-governors-opposed-to-new-senate-health-bill/2017/07/14/1b158842-68a4-11e7-a1d7-9a32c91c6f40_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_healthcare-620pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.e0d040e7b8d5 … 
Interested in your answer. @senrobportman
If the BCRA isn't good enough for Congress it isn't good enough for us. Wonder if McCain's blood clot would've been caught under BCRA plans?
Keep fighting for those businesses and drug users while the rest of your constituents are telling you to vote NO on Trumpcare.
Who are you going to call for help Rob? Getting scared? I would be. Have fun voting YES.
I can't explain it but the entire synopsis is becoming humorous to me. You all are going to start falling like leaves. One after the other.
Please state your position on the healthcare bill, Senator. Be a hero and protect your constituents--and all Americans.
Where are you on the "tweaks" to the healthcare bill?  Medicaid and Preexisting conditions must be protected!
I run a small business and it would level the field if the rich payed the same tax rates on unearned income as I pay on every dime I make.
How about fighting for the middle class?
See this baby, Senator? His life is, very literally, in your hands. 
Do you have a conscience?
Will you let him die?
Tax "reforn"?  Why do you Republicans lie every time you say anything?  It's a tax cut for the rich. Call it what it is?
tax reform that benefits businesses; not reform that robs people of healthcare!
None of this will be worth trying for if people are not able to benefit from it b/c they are dying without healthcare!!
And throw our environment in the toilet?! Companies can do w/o xtra profits. They need 2 b responsible to the land. What regs would u cut?
Regulations, or protections?
Awesome. Can you now tweet about all of the cancer patients in Ohio? Will you fight against unfair GOP legislation that will take from them?
HEALTH CARE. HOLD A TOWN HALL.

.@SenatorCollins: GOP health care bill "could lead to insurance plans that really are barely insurance at all." http://abcn.ws/2tfyJkR

Holy guacamole, we had 1300 people at our Martha's Vineyard town hall this morning! This is what democracy looks like. Thank you for coming! 
And start by voting YES on Healthcare, please
Ur from AZ!
This is an "A" (ohioan) to "B" (@senrobportman) issue. Kindly "C" your way out of it. I've not seen an ohioan for this bill yet.
