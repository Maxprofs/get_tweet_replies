#JUST1MORE
@RealSkipBayless how that?
@MikeRust16
@cchilton711 is about to hop on bandwagon @cavs
If they win one more I will, still not sold
Hahahahah
@KingJames king 
WAY TO GO CAVS!! That's how you finish a game!!!
Start everyone who played in the fourth.
Not really we need Kyrie
Kyrie need to stop that westbrook ball shit. Too many damn missed shots
Bron gets pissed if people don't shoot
Issa sweep
Wise words RyRy
He's still lebitch leflop lefag leluck
less hate, more love?

@IROD2010 FUCK INDIANA!!!
Pacers are so bad LUL
I can't say I agree because the pacers don't have a W in the series!
I'm a Pacers fan, and we are not the deeper team. This team is an average team. That's why we are down 3-0
Y'all still blew a 26pt lead in the fourth
Not in the playoffs
Hmm 25 of lead blown in 2 quarters 
Or a 26 or lead blown in 1 quarter.
Hmm regular season in 4th plus overtime. Or road playoffs game in two.

Great comeback and all, but I'd be more impressed if they waited until there was 2:12 left in the third quarter.
