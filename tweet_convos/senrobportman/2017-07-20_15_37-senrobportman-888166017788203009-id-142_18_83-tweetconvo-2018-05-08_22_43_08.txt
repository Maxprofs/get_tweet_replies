As a new OH homeowner, I ask you to vote no today. Without healthcare I will lose mobility, to no fault of my own. #noonahca
If you care so much about civility in politics how could you endorse a guy who tweets: https://mobile.twitter.com/JoshMandelOhio/status/888055970781331456 … ?!?
Sad to see @ADL_National become a partisan witchhunt group targeting people for political beliefs. I stand with @Cernovich & @JackPosobiec https://twitter.com/Cernovich/status/887703835753447425 …
Let's get a bipartisan plan done !
I'd like to politely inform you, Dear Sir, POTUS is insane, ignorant and corrupt. Best Regards.
You should take the chance to turn your back while it's still there.

Not a real news station.
#KeepACA. No Motion to Proceed on #BCRA. 22 million Americans can't lose health insurance. #NoBCRA
Seriously. Fox News?  Why not just be interviewed by a supermarket tabloid magazine. Vote NO on ACA repeal/replace. Work w/ Dems to fix ACA!
The reason John McCain can fight cancer is because of health insurance. Give everyone else a chance to have affordable care.
Parents begging for there childrens life and your more worried about the next Koch brothers check or how juch you can be bought for
Since this is tagged for HCR, I assume you will be working across the aisle to improve the #ACA rather than voting to appease #45?
1/ Senator, I spoke to your office yesterday & they assured me you would NEVER vote for a bill with a terrible CBO score.
So we will wait and see. And keep calling.
What political discourse is that - you never have an open town hall meeting. @senrobportman
Going on @FoxNews does not promote civil discourse.
If civility in discourse is important to you, then you shouldn't go on Fox News.
Amen.
809,000 Ohioans will lose access to Medicaid, to be pushed into 13,000 deductible Cruz plans. Unconscionable.
I am sorry I refuse to watch news as long a Geraldo and Sean are on their they are not my cup o  tea. Not new mean and hateful GOP
We should behave when you try to kill our children? #healthcare
Yes McCain has been honorable- we need honor & ethics in gov - call out lies & disinformation #Trump
You never said whether you're yes/no on the #BCRA. POTUS said you were yes. If you AREN'T yes, then please correct the record.
I can't believe you would buy scheme from admini. The cuts are still there. Band-aids won't help. Listen to @JohnKasich. Ohio is in peril
You're babbling about this mush when you are holding up the entire health care bill?  Are you serious?  Liar! https://mobile.twitter.com/ForAmerica/status/887778066184929280/video/1 …
Civility? But the words you choose when talking about my healthcare are mean, negative, and untrue. Be the change you wish to see
THIS! @senrobportman https://twitter.com/gussnarp/status/888194304178565121 … @CbusIndivisible @OhioDistrict12
If civility in discourse is important to you, then you shouldn't go on Fox News.
It's hard to stay civil for years while being ignored by your senator. Why not take a step by holding town halls? Like real ones.

Once Trump supporters on #ACA work out you've sacked their health care, you'll suffer their wrath. Do the right thing, @senrobportman
Civility is an active, not passive, and requires Town Hall meetings and listening.
^^this!^^
My thoughts exactly.
Vote no on the healthcare bill!  I sure am going to vote no on you!
@SenateGOP 
I support Graham-Durbin bill,
Bipartisan efforts in general, HC esp.
Separating chaos cult from Repubs
Speaking of civility, you endorsed known racist & alt right supporter Mandel. Waiting for you to speak out against this hatemonger.
Being civil you refuse to ever meet with any one or have a town http://hall.You  just have people in wheel chairs arrested
Civility means working with both sides on issues that effect all Ohians, not just blindly supporting GOP agendas. Vote NO to repeal ACA!
A true republican American hero
Rob, if your bills didn't kill, destroy earth, allow a mentally ill nut to rule, and drive us to economic ruin, things would be civil.
You stated we have lots of problems,not working with President Trump is the biggest.Not repealing O care is next.
You endorsed Josh Mandel, am I to understand you endorsed this, too? http://dispatch.com/news/20170720/mandel-calls-jewish-adl-partisan-witch-hunt-group …
2020 is just around the corner, voters are watching
When even Tucker Carlson knows this healthcare repeal is a #wealthcare bill, you know it is not good.
U think so little of Ohio voters  that they will forget u betrayed your promise to repeat ACA? Another crooked politician
Shouldn't civility begin with the POTUS? (Good luck with that.)
There will be nothing left Presidential in the Whitehouse after he is done destroying it. Pls do something about this. #45
A lot of weasel words there, Rob but when you say ACA is failing Ohio you are failing to say it's because you and the GOP want it to fail.
Had you worked with the democrats you could have fixed the ACA instead of killing it and your fellow Ohioans. Bad move, Rob.
How is forcing our seniors out of nursing homes going to help Ohio? Rob, that is just cruel and unChristian of you. And all for tax refund.
You'd best watch your back Sen Portman. You've been far too cozy with Backstabbing Trump. Will you be next? He cares for no others than self
Fraud.
"the need for civility in our political discourse" and you said that on @FoxNews you are kidding right. #WhatAJoke
Senator - You+colleagues in 6th Cir. know 100s of lawyers qualified for prestigious judgeship. So how could u POSSIBLY vote for J. Bush?
Yes @senrobportman *what* will you do??
More important than ever to get your reps on the record for what they will do if/when Mueller is fired.
Senator, disappointed in your "couple of weeks" timeline. If you want to reform healthcare, please schedule hearings. Do the actual work!
Hopes for civility in political discourse, on FOX?  Keep dreaming, Senator.
Come on Portman! Be a hero!
WaPo: Trump has asked about his authority to grant pardons to aides, family members, and even himself. https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/888205477561192448 …
Phrases like "Lyin' Ted" and "LIttle Marco" are not hallmarks of civil political discourse.
Sorry Robbie, the time for civility has long passed. You and your GOP buddies have seen to that. I despise each and every one of you fools!

CBO estimate of the ACA deductible for someone making $26,500 in 2026: $800

Under the BCRA: $13,000, a 1525% increase.
The only real news?
Why not schedule a town hall so your constituents can ask you some tough questions instead if the softball questions from the state media?
If you want to lecture on civility, Robert, you need to first take a hard look at your party and it's vulgarian 'leader'.
that is great! Try some real news channels though.
And the need to continue to not repeal the ACA...
Hope you  are praying that he retains good health insurance, oh wait, he's on Medicare,  isn't  he?  Is that next to be taken away?
Why did you vote to approve a racist and anti gay like Bush to a lifetime job on federal court of appeals? Very disappointed!!!
Very politically correct! Now repeal Obamacare!
Why are you on Fox?  C'mon Rob.
Prayers for Sen McCain. I just wish more Republicans had cared about uncivil discourse before they were the ones on the receiving end.
Civility? We didn't lie, insult, and degrade folks, #45 did. We didn't assault a reporter your guy did. Clean your own house first, please.
With this logic in approaching the new CBO score, you should hold a townhall to explain your position
.@RobPortman believes the CBO gives GOP HC plan hope. He told me: "I'm hopeful, I may be the most optimistic person in the Senate on this."
Why are you optimistic that 15 million ppl in a few months, 2018, will lose coverage under Trumpcare per CBO? Where's the civility there?
I am civilly reminding you to vote for us not your party. We are watching.
How about the need for those with preexisting conditions to have/keep insurance?

Tell that to your President and get back to me! Leader? Why do you just go on Fixed News!
Where was civility last year, when you helped steal Garland's SC seat or when you endorsed a self-proclaimed pussy grabber?
Yes, we should all be totally civil while our senators plot to destroy our lives by taking away our healthcare.
You really should've made sure you were one of the ones that defected from the #Trumpcare vote. This will be remembered in 2022.
And health care for all right?
Civil discourse? Let's review how civil u were towards Obama. Remember signing a letter addressed to Iran? What about SCOTUS? Robert Gates?
Help us save @SenJohnMcCain

Civility in our public discourse? You voted to confirm John Bush, an uncivil, homophobic judge, to the powerful 6th Circuit. Unconscionable
Maybe you should spend more time fulfilling your promises instead of lecturing people #repeal #Primarythegop
Amen to both
Speedy recovery for Senator McCain.   Did you discuss your plans to resign?
The first two words of this tweet translated the rest into "bullshit, bullshit...bullshit and bullshit."
Ohioans would love to discuss our hopes with you, but you won't meet with us.  Sad.
civility won't come without repentance for trump
Civility from the swamp elites in the house and senate for 48 hours if you are lucky. Get back to us next week.
Actions speak louder then words. You sold out. You put party over country. You took and oath.
How about a need for accountability?
Flashback: @senrobportman , @SenCapito, and @lisamurkowski all voted to repeal Obamacare before. What happened? 
Repeal Obamacare.
He's a traitor and looks like you are proving to be the same!
Be civil & keep your "campaign" promise to repeal ObamaCare.
As soon as you ate up for reelection you are fired
McCain is my kind of politician; puts America 1st even it means going against his party.  Please take note Sen. Portman.
2/ Now you know the score. Please don't lie. Listen to Gov. Kasich, who'd have to administer this nightmare.
#MedicareForAll
"Just cuz I'm trying to cause premature deaths of 20 million people is no reason for people to be rude to me." - Rob Portman, paraphrased
Seems accurate 
Between Porthole not wanting to work with dems to fix the #ACA & his lack of fighting for a clean environment,  ur right!
If states manage healthcare what happens to people with pre-existing conditions if they move to another state?
How about you go on a legitimate news show?? Fox is anything but. No wonder you have no clue what your constituents want.
That's great. We all hope Sen McCain recovers fully now get off the dime & obliterate the ACA & find a replacement. 2018 is coming.
I was happy to hear you say repeal with out replacement is not appropriate 
Thank you
I agree!  I just hope he wasn't spouting empty words!!
That's great!  Can we now discuss the horror of any of the health care bills you will vote on next week? #NoOnMTP #ProtectOurCare #FixACA
Keep up the good work and remain on the high road...confident your efforts will be instrumental in crafting a quality health care plan...
Shovel this empty sentiment over to President Bannon! Ohio is watching 
Do appointments like that of judge Bush today reflect civility
He has voted for everything. I don't trust him to do the right thing for any of us. Sold out, sell out, and he could give a rat's ass.
Passive-aggressive SOB. Wish he could be recalled.
Starting with Fox!
You may not want to repeat you were on Fox.
Obliviate ocare. I don't want to hear that name again
Help our President Senator. Help me to obliviate obama.
We will try to be civil but you & GOP  continue to back unfit, unqualified and possibly treasonous POTUS. Further, you won't do town halls.
Likely only because you think you need his vote, rather than truly caring

To be clear, Obamacare isn't failing. @realdonaldtrump is sabotaging it.

BREAKING: In rare joint letter, insurers say Cruz amendment "unworkable in any form" and will lead to "widespread terminations of coverage." 

Chilling: Trump in 1993 previewing the full-blown racism that will later become the hallmark of his presidential campaign @rabiasquared 
Incivility in political discourse is when you indulge collusion to steal a lifetime SCOTUS seat from an electoral majority.

Poll: Which healthcare plan to you prefer? 

The latest Republican budget proposal, in a nutshell? More tax cuts for the top 1 percent. Cuts for everyone else. 

A horrific metaphor for Trumpcare: this disabled woman literally being ripped from her wheelchair. 
#StopTrumpcare  

THE WORLD IS WATCHING! YOU ARE FAILING YOUR CONSTITUENTS, @senrobportman !
