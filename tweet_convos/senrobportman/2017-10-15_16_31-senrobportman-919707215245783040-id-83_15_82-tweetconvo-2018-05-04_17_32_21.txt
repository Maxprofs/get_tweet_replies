How bout you get out of your Model T and listen to some constituents..btw what's considered "middle class" again?  Sure as heck isn't $150k!
150k isn't super rich. The point he was making is that people making 150k should 10000% get tax cuts. Stop punishing even tiny success
A success at what cost? They really wanted to help the working class, they'd cap these Taxcuts. Medium income s $52k btw.
Middle class, on average, is up to $125k. In wealthier states like mine, NJ, it's above 150
These upper middle class families deserve and need tax cuts. As does the lower middle class. Stop demonizing successful Americans.
Senator Portman is correct on the middle class. He's number may be a little high, but it isn't far off.
The problem is that Senator Portman and the GOP are proposing to RAISE taxes on the upper middle class $100-$200 combined family income.
Not so sure about that. That's not right though. I support tax cuts across the board. Certainly no tax raises. But there's no "plan" yet
In case you didn't notice..this was a very bad choice to tweet.  @GOP Stop destroying our country for your own benefit! #EnoughIsEnough
He is so clueless.
That's just it, they're not clueless, except Trump. They all know what they're doing selfishly. Trumps merely selfish.
Holy crap, are you ever tone deaf! Many Ohioans are struggling from one paycheck to another and you post a photo in your pricey antique car.
Median income is about $52,000, total made by all family members, an income of $4,333 a month. A car like yours is online for $22,000.
So that's like 5 months salary for your average constituent. And I read today you think the middle class makes $150,000 a year.
We need help, and government was invented to work for the people. You're worth $14,000,000. You can afford a Model T. Most never will.
You tried to sell us a republicare bill that would strip millions of their necessary healthcare. Tried more than once.
I'm on LTD and get a check for ~1,500 month. My family income is ~70,000. Have have two major health issues. I'm now on husband's insurance
His deductible is $6,000. I had treatments this summer, got a bill for nearly $80,000 before they worked it out and now it's 4,000, yay.
Worried I'll have to take $ from my retirement, a resource few have, for us to cover all my healthcare bills. My son is 17, needs college $
On one hand, the Model T and riding in #Pelotonia so I want to like you.
On the other, constant GOP tax lies and Trump support so I do not.
Make sure to talk to your friends on the drive about gun control and why it’s a priority after Vegas.
I’ll bet the people of Puerto Rico will vicariously enjoy your automobile ride while they struggle to find clean water.
Not even PR, try Flint, Michigan
You don’t have to travel far to find an America Rob Portman has let down.
Your accent needs work.
So does ur soul
Tell me about it.
I'm sorry to hear
Fix It 
Instead of healthcare, tax cuts 4 the working, middle class wage earners. multi millionaire is rubbing our noses in his wealth.
Unfortunate that politicians think showing off their life of luxury (often on the taxpayer’s dime) is somehow relatable to their voters.
elitist?
Republican senator thinks $150,000 is a middle-class income in Ohio  https://shareblue.com/republican-senator-thinks-150000-is-a-middle-class-income-in-ohio/ …
Way to connect with your base of voters who can also afford to roll around in million-dollar vintage cars. By base of voters, I mean the 1%.
I looked it up, you can get a T for ~$22,000. Still WAY too much for us peons. Rob's worth $14,000,000.
Ah, didn’t realize that. Still an interesting pic to show off when most of his voters couldn’t even cover a $1,000 emergency medical bill!
The more I see this picture in my feed, the more it ticks me off!  Have you no soul?
https://shareblue.com/republican-senator-thinks-150000-is-a-middle-class-income-in-ohio/ … Portman nothing More than #TrumpsPuppet He has VOTED twice 2 Give #Ohioans  Deathcare #NationalCharacterCountsWeek 
That's when you know Portman has too much money. I'd love to be able to fix my only vehicle!
Look at me! I'm rich and out of touch w/ Ohioans especially on healthcare and women's reproductive rights. But the car!"-PointlessPortman
This weekend I’ve been thinking about #PuertoRico, #CaliforniaWildfires and #CHIP. Also #opioidcrisis in SE #Ohio. Need you to get to work!
Notice how quiet Rob is about the opioid crisis today?
“[On] gay rights, Trump motioned toward Pence and joked, ‘Don’t ask that guy—he wants to hang them all!’” AND you support this moron ? 
Perfect! u driving around in your historic bonus car for fun, while the rest of us are figuring out car payments & healthcare.Takes the cake
Take a drive by a funeral home. How did you vote on the bill that 60 Minutes exposed last night-Is there nothing you R's won't do for money?
I'm not really sure how a former Congressman, Dir of OMB, Trade Rep, & current Senator can afford that, but have a good time!
And what about shoring up the ACA so that every person in America has universal healthcare. The same kind You have!
And with yr matching disposition
Amazon: $127 Million from Ohio taxpayers! $1.2 Billion more in other state incentives, tax deals, abatements, land grabs. Why? Bezos has $
In fact, Amazon has $30 BILLION IN CASH. Why do they need Federal/State $ to put small retailers out of business? How about give them some $
Bet you didn't drive it to a #TownHall to hear from your constituents
What kind of gas mileage do you get on that?
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ex-dea-agent-opioid-crisis-fueled-by-drug-industry-and-congress/ … #Complicit
Truly out of touch Rob-bot. Maybe get out and meet with The People, we call it TownHalls with the Constituents anytime
This analysis suggests that if Trump gets rid of NAFTA, the US could lose jobs and cars would cost more. Sad!
Why are you letting Trump ruin our healthcare system by refusing to follow the law and pay the insurance subsidies? Ohio will be hurt. Ohioans will be hurt. Do you even care? Of course you don’t care - your healthcare is free and Mitch McConnell told you not to care.
Drive it right on out of Ohio! Time to dump the GOP in Ohio. #dumpthegop
How many "favors" did you have to do for your big-$$$ donors to pay for that fancy ride? Payoff for trying to strip Ohioans of health care?
We have worried about health insurance, PR, NK, Iran, TRUMP...but glad to see you took a drive in the car WE BOUGHT YOU
We see what you think about $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
A great way to cap off your wk:
1. Resigning
2. NOT violating a woman's right to choose
3. Not taking Med ins from kids
No, what would have been a way to cap off this week is NOT kicking millions of children off their Med ins
No you DIDNT just tweet that
Cool
@DavidPepper  You really are tone deaf aren't you?  Nice touch adding the guy in the hat for DIVERSITY!
CALIFORNIA. PUERTO RICO. CHIP.  OBAMACARE.

The (non)reaction from the GOP to this tragedy cements that #Benghazi was pure politics played by Republicans on the graves of heroes. https://twitter.com/votevets/status/919694450778972160 …
That explains a lot. Your thinking is 100 Years our of date. #savedaca #savechip #saveaca #impeachtrump #campaignfinancereform #trumprussia
I bet that Model T cost A LOT of money! Please flaunt it as ppl lose healthcare, are dying in PR & CA & we're on the verge of nuclear war.
You are so lucky to live in the lap of luxury on our dime. @healthcare not #wealthcare or #trump tax scam
You have a model T. Nice car but seeing it makes sense that you think middle-class is $150,000 a year
Wow.  Thanks for all you do for us.  Did we pay for that car?
But quickly get back to Washington. Kamalla Harris says that CHIP has not been funded. Better you should drive a newer GM model.
It's nice that you can afford that, while your free healthcare is paid for by the people and your pension will be $180,000 for life.

Beautiful auto! Drive it to Lima next time
Driving to go cash your donor check
I don't think the Koch's would appreciate you goofing off like this when there's tax 'reform' to push through.

Fuck your photo op. Either do your work for us  or drive it off a cliff.


Here is the Executive Order to undermine the ACA.

Long on propoganda. Short on details. Plenty of sabotage. 2/ 

Susan Collins: Trump is "affecting the ability of vulnerable people to receive health care right now." 
Wow you plan a lot of fun stuff for yourself.  Maybe squeeze in a little time for healthcare and chips?? Or will you hitting links w/trump?

Pres. Trump is at his Virginia golf club, marking his 73rd visit to one of his golf properties since taking office https://nbcnews.trib.al/hVWuXyM  
And you need a tax cut? Think not! Who has the bigger ego, you or Trump? Just keep telling us you represent ALL Ohioans.
And maybe NOT be your own public relations advisor.
Isn't it time to cap congressional spending on welfare-state programs and let #Capitalism do the driving in the USA, sir? #ModelC
DO SOME WORK FOR US.
Rob is one of the career politicians & DC profiteers who turned the US into an unanswerable #WarState run by global billionaires.
Holy shit, that's deep. And way too accurate.
Are u watching 60 Minutes?  I am.
Too bad you have no Puerto Rico family members, Maybe they could school you like your gay son did. #educateyourselfskeletor
Rob, you were the US trade rep.  Will tearing up NAFTA and entering into trade wars help the Auto Industry?  Please answer...YOU KNOW BETTER
Who the fuck is at the helm ???

Dang. You sure do like posting pic of yourself. 
Robs in love......with hisself.
Take a drive by a Children’s Hospital near you, honk and wave. I’m sure those whom once benefited from CHIP would greatly appreciate it
The Presidents campaign colluded with murdeous foreign nationals to subvert democracy. That hasn’t happened in over 100 years
@GOP complicit treason,danger nukes, inciting racist NRA domestic terrorism, sabotaging ACA, corrupt lying #NoConfirmations #nullify2016
