genuine respect for your charity work but heed those who live with #healthcare issues daily #NoBCRA
Sen. Portman, think about how much the Cleveland Clinic benefits from the ACA, including its Medicaid expansion.  #ProtectOurCare in #Ohio
How'd they feel about the $13,000 deductibles in y'all's plan?
Research is great but doesn't do much good if we can't afford treatment. #ProtectOurCare #FixACA

CALL @senrobportman. There is zero room to debate on #RepealAndRun & taking health care from 32M Americans. #ProtectOurCare. 844-432-0883 
You are a complete fraud.  Total disregards for Ohioans- Acting as if you care as you strip millions of care.  Country 1st, party 2nd
This is how democracy dies.
8- There are rumors about virtually every R Senator being lured to vote yes on MTP.

Do not be comforted by statements until the vote.
All or Nothing politics have no place in our Democracy.  This isn't a zero sum game.
Single payer would help a lot more people with cancer than a bike ride would. I say this as a biomedical scientist.
Our GOP Governor gets it, do you?  Voters want to see Congress act in congress.  What side of history will you be on?
The CEO of @ClevelandClinic doesn't think the crappy "healthcare" bill is a good idea @senrobportman...

How can you vote to take away insurance from the most vulnerable among us ?.Lots of kids with cancer use ACA
Protect cancer patients by rejecting repeal & BCRA. Work w ALL senators 2 get best ideas. Have hearings. Listen 2 experts. #ProtectOurCare
then don't punish people with pre existing conditions Rob!
GOP plan promising lower premiums could make deductible $13,000 for a $26,000 salary per CBO! S A good deal, Sen?Need bipartisan ACA repair!
Now that Repubs control Congress & Supreme Crt, how do you plan to hold the Pres accountable? Checks & balances don't exist now. #ohio
See your tweets & feel, as leader 4 Ohio, that UR fiddling while Rome burns. I appreciate involvement but detachment fr DC madness is scary.
They shouldn't have to.


Major portions of GOP healthcare bill found to violate Senate rules http://hill.cm/mzZsJwg  
Hey Rob, what is your intended vote on the motion to proceed? Have they flipped you to support this disaster of a bill
If you support he elimination of lifetime limits and mandatory coverage of preexisting conditions, why would you be in favor of Trumpcare?
Senator what is your stand on lifetime limits and coverage of preexisting conditions? Both issues important to cancer patients and survivors
Sad what's become of the GOP. Only hero to acknowledge the dysfunction in the WH is recovering from brain surgery. So NOT politics as usual

I would like to hear even one undecided Republican Senator defend a THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE. https://twitter.com/lauralitvan/status/888118654759354368 …
https://twitter.com/TopherSpiro/status/888373567708172288 …. You are not seriously falling for the WH sales pitch on crap bill?
1: ALERT: Trump admin is using fake #'s to flip moderates— 
saying people can be moved from Medicaid to Cruz plans without harm. Via @WSJ: 
Sales pitch is a nice way to put it. They lie and Portman will use lies to justify trees vote to appease big $ donors. Shameful.
Can you assure us you know what you're voting for? http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/343553-unhappy-senators-complain-about-healthcare-process … #mysterybill
RU flipping your Healthcare Vote? RU going against wishes of the majority? Will you do the rights thing? Country over Party. Vote NO!
hope you listened 2 my pal Jay on ACA. Works everyday for us to get the healthcare we deserve. Remember what he said to you.
Make sure CA Survivors can get healthcare. Preexisting cindition trap!

I'd like to know if this is true @senrobportman
2: They flipped Portman yesterday. Cassidy? Gullible as ever. 
Honor their compassion by voting no this morning. Do not allow consideration of a mystery bill likely to harm millions. #healthcare
Great to see you at a great cause with outstanding community support!!

I'd love to introduce you to Ethan and explain what the protections in the ACA mean to our family. Better yet, I'd like to show you. 
Fraud.
Fix ACA bipartisan - after you take recess.
Going to be a real bummer if people can't afford the treatment that research yields.  No wealthcare. #VoteNoBCRA
That's wonderful. Lost my daughter to cancer. Now wouldn't it be nice if they didn't have to worry about healthcare bills too!
They're gonna need it bad if you and the rest of the GOP pass this new bill. #VoteNo
Did ya tell them the ppl w/ reoccurring cancer would be #preexistingconditions & that the GOP is trying to take away their #ACA protections?
Great. But if you can't afford health insurance or your CANCER puts you in the Preexisting condition ghetto this is beyond cruel.
Because I'm the very definition of ore existing condition! I'm a woman & a cancer survivor!
You know I'm a childhood cancer survivor&if u take my health insurance away I can't afford my yearly checkups!Trumpcare wouldn't insure me
Senator, I hope you're getting the message.....work with Dems to improve the ACA.  Vote NO on any attempts to repeal.
AARP will monitor each Senator’s vote & report results to all of our 38 million members in our publications, online, and in direct alerts.
Please remember that all the research in the world won't be beneficial if ppl cannot afford or are refused health insurance
Why are you willing to vote away healthcare for cancer victims?
Work 2 keep Essent. Benefits like pre-existing conditions so all these cancer survivors can afford insurance
Did anyone there talk about the devastation to be caused by TrumpCare to health and life of cancer patients? #ShameOnYou
It was great to see you tonight! I'm a survivor who benefits. I hope you'll take our stories deeply to heart. Lifetime lmts are a BIG DEAL!!
America 1st #MAGA #BoycottIsrael 
Tell @Israel Make your own legislation not OURS! Senate Bill 720 is Unconstitutional! Read it!
am a patient at CCF! Great place! Won't be able to afford it under BCRA

Schumer doubles down on his earlier calls for a bipartisan health care plan 
 
portman is spineless add his pic
