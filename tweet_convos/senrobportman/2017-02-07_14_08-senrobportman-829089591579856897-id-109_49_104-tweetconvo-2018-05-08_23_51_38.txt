Does Portman have integrity?
Will he just follow the party line as he did with DeVos?
#RussiaSanctions
#TheResistance

start working for your state!
Don't act as if you're sensible moderate when you vote Yes on #devos and censor @SenWarren.OH will remember. #indivisibleOH12
you voted for Betsy Devos. Nothing else you ever say matters.
sure hope Russia doesn't donate $51k
is this an issue you will stand up 2 @realDonaldTrump on or R you just talking tough and will cave when you vote like usual?
your votes on DeVos and rebuking Senator Warren are absolutely disgusting.  #spineless #votethemout
cannot get through to your offices by phone. Poor representation. Vote NO ON Sessions and Pruitt. #stopsessions #StopPruitt
$50000 you pocketed gets Devos a seat in Congress. Don't get comfortable. You're out next year.
Thank you for taking a stand against #Russia. Keep sanctions bc of #Ukraine
Schedule a town hall. We double dog dare you. #resist #portmantownhall
Or until Putins donates to your Campaign..
Mr. Portman you are a coward. Stand up to Trump and Party. Say no to Sessions, and let Warren Speak!
you'll cave just like the DeVos vote.
glad to hear it.  Be careful or you'll get censured next #LetLizTalk
Yes, but what will happen when Russia gives Rob "The 51,000 Dollar Man" Portman 51,000 Dollars?
GOP turncoat! Get under the HRC party next election! American Christian Movement
US should return occupied lands to Mexico and people of Hawaii
wish you'd stand up against @potus but you are a #sellout you had leverage
These are the 49 Senators who just voted to silence Elizabeth Warren for QUOTING CORETTA SCOTT KING http://thkpr.gs/d000a470c6b4 
1 of the 49 Senators who just voted to silence Elizabeth Warren for QUOTING CORETTA SCOTT KING.

Shameful. 

#PoliticalHack
First, voting for Devo$ and then voting to silence Senator Warren. You're on a roll...out the door next election. #shame

I think we'll look back on this treatment of Senator Warren as the moment the @GOP lost whatever was left of its soul. @SpeakerRyan
you have let the people of Ohio down. We will forever remember your unwillingness to change your vote.

@StevenLHall1 I agree sanctions shouldn't be lifted until cause is addressed, tho not until cause are addressed. Grammar pls.
know that there are now more of us against you than for you.
These are the 49 Senators who just voted to silence Elizabeth Warren for QUOTING CORETTA SCOTT KING http://thkpr.gs/d000a470c6b4  
but you're afraid of Bannon so you'll roll over and offer up your constituents like you did today.
Just like how you searched for the underlying reasons millions felt DeVos wasn't qualified?
I'm sure you'll sellout to the highest bidder.
I fear the US- gov might try to push regardless to ease them for mere promises of words to co-op in the Me.

you sold us out
you gonna put that 51k into our education systems you just fucked by voting in Devoss or no? #PaytoPlay
what an absolute disappointment. You can't even fight for kids and their education.  We won't forget . #sellout
you shouldn't have been allowed to vote for Betsy DeVos. #sellout
you talk a good anti-Putin/pro-sanction game, so why aren't you co-sponsoring this? #lipservice http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/politics/russia-sanctions-gop-senators-donald-trump/index.html …
I don't care WHY you voted for Devos, I only care that you aren't re-elected. #republicansgottago
You no longer have any credibility in a moral argument. Ohio will remember.
, trying very hard to divert from your reckless vote to confirm unqualified Educ Sec, aren't you? #Disappointing
there were 51,000 underlying causes for you to sell out our children to Betsy DeVos.  But then, I need not remind you.

You need to go. You represent party over your constituents. How much did @BetsyDeVos give you? Betsy bought her job. Sad
I hope you sleep well on your bed of @BetsyDeVos money, being a thread in her #Partyliner. You smell of fish.
what about the bowling green massacre?
$51,000 for your vote on Devos. You should be ashamed!!!
thank you standing up against bullies and standing up for Ukraine!
Hope your  $50,000 payout from DeVos was worth selling out our children and our teachers. #CorruptScoundrel #VoteThemOut
I am so disappointed in you.
what retirement home did you choose?
and you should quit now because we're on your ass now like rabid dogs
We believe you've shown yourself as a #RubberStampforTrump
Since the president was probably put in office due to Russian hacking and psyops, will that be addressed?
.  And you will do absolutely nothing about it...
I see many of us tweeting that we disagree with Portman on DeVos. Let's make sure he never gets elected again. Never forget
If you won't stand up to Trump on DeVos, the most unqualified candidate in history, you won't on this either.
#sellout
I'm sure if trump wants sanctions lifted you'll lift them post haste. You certainly don't care about best for country.
You lost all respect today.
the underlying cause of public education regressing 50 years will be your yes vote on DeVos.
tough talk but your $51k vote shows your true colors
Ohio will remember #sellout
.@senrobportman let's talk about the real issue: @realDonaldTrump's violation of foreign-emoluments clause of Constitution #ImpeachTrump
you going to lose your spine if Trump releases the sanctions like you were a Trump puppet for Devos nomination
.@senrobportman why don't we talk about why you voted for DeVos?
your  #DeVos confirmation has lost you Ohio. We don't trust you and will work to end your political career from now on.
Sadly, @senrobportman You lost your credibility this morning when you voted for #Devos. All we hear now is Whawhawhawha. #coward
Correct. I hope you can be trusted on this matter. Many GOP decisions lately are not best for the people.
so cute when you try to pretend like your not on the take & care Ohio knows better & you will too next election #RESISTANCE
@peacegalaxy 
This never should come to the table. Donald Trump releasing his taxes should be on the floor of senate!
you care more about #Ukraine than about Ohio students, teachers and schools. I assure you that #Ohio will remember. #sellout
interesting timing to your tough talk about Russia. Are you going to demand a bipartisan investigation into Russia hacking?
the same should have applied to Iran And Cuba. What did the Senate do and in particular you
Does your list include Russian meddling in the election? Trumps tax returns and potential ties to Russia?
Are you really going to look under that rug?
Which side are you on?
Ukraine is under threat with Russian backed forces fighting as you speak. PLEASE Stand by NATO! It is absolutely essential!
Trying to get folks to forget that you sold out Ohio's kids today? Think your constituents are fools? Sad.
#PortmanTownHall for February 20th recess. Let's make it happen, people. Keep his phones ringing!
I’ve heard that #Russia has killed some people, but so has the US so it’s pretty much a wash. Can’t remember who said it.
No matter how many other tweets you post, today you will be remembered as putting money over children. #NoonDeVos
You forgot to add"but if trump wants to remove them for his pal Putin I'm ok with that."
sell out
Your vote today on DeVos was a disgrace to our country's children, teachers and parents.  Party and Donors over your voters?
you all will need to fight. #RESIST to protect the constitution & American values
sorry, intern trying to bury the DeVos comments, I don't think this is going to work
