I hope to hear you speak against the ban and Bannon's coup moves at NSC
Yes, another GOP yesman defending his mighty leader. Give me a break. Just say Trump is a jerk.
Sounds like Jan Brewer wants a job in Trump cabinet too. Hooray for @ananavarro .Trump hires yesmen only
you ARE WRONG R.P.!

turning away #refugees is not "consistent with our values" #ColumbusOhio is watching

Miller & Bannon botched unconstitutional Muslim EO  kept it from DOA until Fri. When will you stand up to Trump!
You must be repulsed by the president's immoral actions. PLEASE don't look away!  We're counting on you.
Try not to misrepresent Ohioans, you hack.
As a constituent you claim to represent I'll be watching closely and waiting for you to speak out against the insanity of the last week.

I would like to hear your thoughts on the ban & EPA
I will be tuning in. If the #MuslimBan isnt mentioned & strictly unsupported? You've lost my vote.
Instead of promoting your TV appearance, how about a statement against @POTUS's un-American #MuslimBan?
