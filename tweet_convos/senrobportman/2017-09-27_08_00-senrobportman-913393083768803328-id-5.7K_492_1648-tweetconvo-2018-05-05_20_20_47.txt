The best thing about you being one of the younger congressional criminals is that life imprisonment is likely a long time for you
GOP tax reform puts the ultra rich first!!!
The "Americans" you put first are tax consumers, not tax payers. Nobody earning under $50,000 a year should pay any income tax.
State & Federal income taxes remove money that would have been saved to start new businesses, send kids to college, etc.  It impoverishes us
This is exactly why the American people have lost trust in you. Politics and self preservation before people.
Lies, lies, lies, lies, and more lies. Your approach cuts taxes for Koch Bros and corporations, and does nothing for working Americans.
first time I’ve seen something published before vote. Thanks Speaker Ryan
They are taking away state and local tax deductions from early reports. They think we are dumb enough to believe that it lowers our tax.
Rick stop watching CNN
Donald.. pull Ur head out.
The only thing broken in this country is @realDonaldTrump !!!! IMPEACH TRUMP NOW!!!!!!!!!!
And Pence, Ryan and McConnell.

You are a FAILED leader. No healthcare,no wall,no immigration reform.  Now, no tax reform. GOP..GRAND OLD PUTZES.
I will believe it when I see it
yeah, for insiders.
At some point could you produce legislation that doesn't screw the little guy? That would be nice.

Don't believe it... Show us the money!  The money you aren't hiding for your friends.  #TaxReform

Anyone remember that time Paul Ryan passed legislation to make it easier for the mentally ill to have access to guns? https://twitter.com/nancycordes/status/915218972643151872 …
Could you put aside your agenda for one minute & put #PuertoRico & #USVI first?
They do not care, it is all about them...

Ryan get bent. Go take a picture
Do #taxcuts for the wealthy sound like they will help you? Of course not. That's b/c they WON'T.
The Truth in ~90sec
That's funny Michele, I didn't think lipturds had a sense of humor ! Lol !.. by the way, you got the wrong color.....it's Black !!!   Haha !
Lipturds- so creative! I prefer Repube!
Haha,  not bad for a puss
You don't address 2nd homes or rental properties! Show the details!
If you think we are going to trust the peeps that tried to sell us TrumpCare to fix the tax code then you are sorely mistaken.
#Impeach45
Too bad you and the rest of the lowlife corrupt politicians aren’t in jail!
The country is in tatters and Americans are DYING. "Do unto others..."
Don't sell us out to Hillary I know ur sad she lost.tell Dems to stop abortion massacres
Looks like an increase in taxes if you are a single person. This is BS they had me fooled into thinking this would be a good thing.
for the country. You make me sick and I can’t wait until you lose the House AND your speakership in 2018.
When we give R's the chance to make the tax system fairer they squander it by cutting taxes for the RICH! 
#Kochtaxbreaks

@realDonaldTrump
Buncha bullshit.  You know your tax cuts are for corporations and the obscenely wealthy, not for the real Americans.
Their only goal: Give hard-earned taxpayer money directly to those who need it the least - the super wealthy.

 FUCK YOU, RYAN! 
@newtgingrich Get lost RHINO Ryan...zero credibility
Lowering corporate taxes is a tax break for the wealthy. Do I need to say it slowly so that you understand?
How can you move your hands with all that Blood on it? Ryan=NRA
Corporations already sitting on billions & credit, if they wanted to they can start building factories & hiring people. Ryan is a con man!
Seriously Republican party will go down..
Dem Party is down since long time ago, Left/DemsLibls/want t destroy Rep Party too  obstructing Pres  Trump work b he has too many followers
Poor thing. When you figure this out it may be to late...do your own research your life is worth more than blindly following politicians.

The tax reform that gives to the rich and screws the middle class? Republicans have NEVER been for the MC. You’re misguided if you think so
#SpeakerRyan Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency? 
Will you ever stand up to Trump? 
Ryan1st?
http://www.politicususa.com/2017/10/01/top-senate-democrat-sends-paul-ryan-reeling-calling-tax-plan-lies.html … Stop lying to the people

Yeah right. Trump is your daddy now and he will get all the money. Stop lying and grow a pair!

We need to admit that there is a significant fascist movement in the United States. This is it.

http://politi.co/2yyo7PS  via @politico
More GOP lies. Just another scheme to funnel more money to the wealthy. #dumpthegop
YOUR TRYING TO ADD THINGS TO THIS TAX BILL WE DON'T WANT!!! LEAVE IT ALONE & PASS IT LIKE IT WAS WRITTEN. DON'T TRUST YOU RYAN
You mean your give away to the rich? Half of the money goes to the top 1%.  A gift to your rich @GOP donors. You are as big a crook as DJT.
Stop the insanity Mr. Ryan, shame on you and your silence!!!!
For God's sake save our democratic Republic before it's too late. 
INVOKE THE 25TH AMENDMENT. 
NOTHING ELSE MATTERS .NOT TAX CUTS,NOTHING !!

So all the Fat cats on the Trump train can break the bank? Our social safety nets being dismantled because of lack of taxes recouped already
Once in ur life say the truth be really true American

Complicit
Be like Jeff flake
How about showing some moral courage and leadership against our abomination of a President and stop pretending it’s just a twitter spat.
What is this bullshit about lowering the cap on 401k contributions and eliminating the mortgage interest deduction, @SpeakerRyan speaker?
You need to stand up and be a MAN! Protect the country and remove Trump! I cannot believe what I am witnessing in my own country!
If you ignore the signs than you don't deserve to speak for the people stop being trumps wingman. Man up don't be a coward
Why should i pay higher taxes than big corporations? Oh i know. So the rich can make more money. Fuck you
We are witnessing the death of the Republican party,it's slow it's painful, it's terrible to witness. But i cant not watch and LAUGH
Liar! This "tax reform" benefits you, the Rich, & of course ur Dear Leader Trump! Raising the lowest tax bracket while lowering the highest!
Okay let's say it the right way it puts the 1% of Americans first
&12000 will not make up loss of head of household credit, personal exemption, itemizing ded. Inc in taxes
America is on to you, Ayn Rand Boy. The facts will win and your #libertarian agenda will go down in flames, just like #TrumpCare.
Please stop calling this guy #Libertarian. He is absolutely not a libertarian. Look at his record. He loves his big government.
Oh, yes, and it's a very libertarian thing to go around making a big deal about who's a real libertarian and who's not. Not interested.
Apparently you are just interested in projecting your ignorance and your prejudices
Your tax reform does NOTHING 4 regular folks. > Repeals estate tax, and the ATM (alternative minimum tax)
Do you actually do any fact finding before posting crap?  Or are you just a GOP hate sounding board?  Sounds like the later to me
For gods sake at least get your facts straight.  It does do for regular folks...it just does MORE for wealthy
The Koch brothers have given u the green light 2 add 2 the deficient 2 give them, the Mercers, yourself, & the rest of the 1% a tax cut.

Hold on to your pocket books middle class. Crook Ryan and GOP is coming after.

Uh, Canada is a joke.
Also, I now look at you and I see Trump.  You say nothing, do nothing and hear nothing... so you are basically Trump.  You've sold yourself.
I have always thought you were a piece of bowel movement.

@SpeakerRyan YOU are a nothing burger. You are past your expiration date and have started to stink.
Mr Ryan. What does trump’s butt taste like?
Shame on you
Snake Ryan has already lined up a few GOP Senators who don't have to face the people in 2018 to kill the tax/budget bill

All choreographed, all staged.

Only difference in 2017 is people have become wise and don't fall for the DC Swamp's shenanigans anymore!
...pure governing, incapable of being influenced by pals, cash, and favors.
ONE STEP CLOSER??? YOU PROBABLY CHANGED THE WHOLE BILL. RESIGN RYAN
Some Legislation needs to Pass tick tock let’s move it along Executive Orders can be undone by next president we need legislation
You forget you workfor the people. What happens when your king is gone??unless the Russians get their shit together you will be voted out
you lie and you lie. you HATE americans. ALL of that money is for the rich. you are a supporter of a #SLAVECLASS can't you EVER work for us?
New @CAPAction report: GOP tax plan gives tRump & his cabinet a $3.5 BILLION tax cut. SURPRISE, SURPRISE, SURPRISE.

1/  How about you & @SenateMajLdr McConnell move one step closer to getting rid of the idiot in the Oval Office? I'm
2/ sure @SenBobCorker isn't the only one up there that sees @realDonaldTrump IS a threat to our country! Might I refer
3/ you to a very interesting article:
4/ Also, you can't deny that @realDonaldTrump exhibits MANY of these symptoms:
GOP of a different stripe today
Being in Upper Penninsula I am getting more thankful you &  WI are several hours away from my me
Paul Ryan=Nero fiddling while Rome burns! U have “gotten used to Trump’s disputes?” A US senator thinks trump is leading us to WW III?
I wonder if many people react to Paul Ryan’s smirk like I do? Isn’t he sworn to defend the Constitution first? Hope Ryan isn’t re-elected!!
I’d like to smack that smirk right off his lying face.
your party just cut Medicare &Medicaid . May all those who voted have to live on that same income of next to nothing

Today you move one step closer to DESTROYING OUR MIDDLE CLASS.  Disgusting lying @GOP
Corporations ARE NOT PEOPLE. BOGUS election, a BOGUS Supreme Court, GOPigs on the KKKoch payroll.  THIS IS TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION.
Bullshit. 
Saw this and had to spread it around. So sadly true. Koch Network of Corporate Donors own the GOP.
So your fucking tax cuts will be paid with some of retirement accounts? Fuck you!
How haven't your constituents kicked the shit out of you? It's beyond me!

Can't wait for karma to visit you , your boss and your coworkers maybe she'll bring one of those bump things your friends advocate for
Isn't the tax cut trump told truckers ONLY pertaining to income of 10 million or more?  Tell me about middle class families.
Ask Dems the question -in power for 8 years and what did they do? ACA: killed middle class -DACA : all special interest - tax reform: NADA
Simply put...when I told a Beneficiary about Paul Ryan's plan today on Medicare.....she cried.  He will kill her.
Saw ur press covfefe - wat a disaster
Tax breaks?  Money to people who don’t pay taxes is a hand out. Everyone should pay something.
The poor get poorer and the rich get richer welcome to a Republicans house
Vote out the weak cowardly Republicans!!  Democrats 2018
You slimy http://asshole.Tax  Reform is not taxcuts for your masters. Without trumps #TaxReturns, and yours.#pillage #AynRand, is a no
so disappointed you didn't  learn from the Bush tax cut goosing the system does not work. Fiscal responsibility does. You flunk econ 501
Screw U Paul.  Your Voucher will not help them.  We all get it, you want us to be inde.  But at what cost to our ppl?
No tax cuts for the rich!  @IronStache
Can I have your job for awhile? Good $ and doing nothing I could do that would not support racist trump @SpeakerRyan @amjoyshow @ananavarro
Trump is your legacy it is in the gutter w/ this man that has, in bob corker’s words, debased our country. Disgusting.
Trump violates Geneva Conv. & insults soldiers wife on Twitter #impeach45
Your silence about @realDonaldTrump speaks volumes about you as a person and American.  #havesomeballs
And we see Donnie's taxes when?   When will the GOP actually do their job and get his SOB (fake President) out of the office?
SPEAKER RYAN HALLOWEEN IS COMING UP WHO SCARES U MORE FREDDIE KRUGER OR DONALD TRUMP?
@SpeakerRyan @GOP @CNN your jokes at dinner not funny.   shd get trump to calm down and Kelly not to lie and SarahHuckabee fire her for lies
How about the broken president u endorsed!
You didn't know what a bump stock was and you're Speaker?!
SHAME ON YOU- You eliminate Meals on Wheels, cut SS & Medicare/Medicaid, give tax breaks to the 1% - we will eliminate the GOP in 2018 !!!
Assault weapons yes. Bump stocks yes. Tracers yes. Tannerite yes. Birth control no. Healthcare for all no. Civil rights no. Equality no.
If this helps the middle class, like you say, why are you going after our 401k plans to fund tax cuts for the rich?
#NotOnePenny to wealthy/wealthy corporations.We demand #TaxFairness .Start serving the poor/middle class instead of the priveledged.
Just saw you on MSNBC and everything you said was a lie. I didn’t think you were as bad as Trump but I see I was wrong!!
You think you are going to get this past us?? OH HELL NO!

Wrong, were one step closer to war.  Trump is delusional and close to a mental breakdown. What the hell are the republicans thinking?
Hey, quick question:  what if it's a rifle that auto-fires birth control pills?  Is that OK for American women???
Only stat that matters today is how much $ U take from NRA + Ur refusal to promote gun violence solutions. Everything U say is a lie. Trump2
Twitter this and Twitter that...right?

God bless you- and your family!!!!!
YOU own the chaos, pain & instability inflicted on our nation by looking the other way as mentally-ill Trump continues unchallenged.
Do your damn Job Paul Ryan! You’re SHAMEFUL! AND IM BORN & BRED WISCONSIN! Disgraceful, you’re a swamp creature!
Your silence is not going unnoticed. The Congressman walking around with Trump blinders on will see the light in the midterm elections #2018
BS! BUNCH OF LYING REPUGS SELL OUTS, TRAITORS, COLLUDERS!!!


Why are you allowing Meuller to privately go after our POTUS? Conflict of interest big time!
Bc he needs 2 cover4 his own welfare!He 2 receivedfrom Russia!So did Mitch & Graham,maybe more MOC!Who knows!UR POTUS?The?1%?Shame on U!
Still waiting for Donnie's taxes!
Eeeeeehhhhhh
Yeah. Send the 1% all the money. Some of it will trickle down any day now.
Speaker Ryan...in the words of Joseph Welch...Have you no sense of decency. In Trumps words...SAD
Can u shut up already about the tax code.u sound like broken record.u need to figure out what 2 do about drug dealing Marino@cardinalhealth
Medicare for all would save 15-20% of business healthcare costs. Huge tax cut for businesses. http://web.mit.edu/e-club/hadzima/how-much-does-an-employee-cost.html …
Deal with the Donald Trump problem FIRST because if he kills us all, the rest won’t matter a bit.
Postcards looks simple. Lowering taxes 4 50 million annual earnings is ignorant. As a conservative u n cabinet have no idea about healthcare
But it will hurt the middle class & increase the deficit. Agree changes, but middle class is lifeblood of US economy. Burn Ayn Rand, Paul.

This Bill is not a over haul nor is it reform
 it's another corporate giveaway on the backs of the 99%
FYI Trickle down is a Myth
U will do nothing serious about the tax code as all the emphasis is on making the rich richer.
...calling BS on you #hypocrite and #liar Ryan. You and your cronies may do well but you screw over the poor and middle class #VoteHimOut

Triumvirate of EVIL!
You mean RICH Americans first.
Quit lying
Trickle down economics does not work.
There's no shortage of investment capital. Only a shortage of sanity & principles & 20T debt. Tax cuts after Bush/Reagan turned into debt.
