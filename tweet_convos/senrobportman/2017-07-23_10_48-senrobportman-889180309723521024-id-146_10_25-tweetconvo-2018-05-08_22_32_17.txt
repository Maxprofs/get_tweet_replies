Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017 (RAA) would remove public safety regulations and replace them with whatever is cheaper. No protections
The Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017 (RAA) would make it difficult to pass new regulations no matter how good they were.
Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017 (RAA) would make it easier for corporations to block the rules that keep us safe. Shame on you, Rob.
#RAA is better called the Risk to Americans Act as it puts us all in danger.
Support and Protect our President Trump. We want what he President wants. You help him !
We are counting on you as a man of compassion to lead the way to kill this draconian health care bill. Stay strong for all of us.
Your party wants to upend 10,000,000s lives and 1/5 of the economy w no hearings and a bad bill. You haven't said this is INSANE. Complicit.
#RAA is just another layer of bureaucracy. Congress already has lawmaking-power to alter agency regs. Stop goofin' around!

We need health care reform to be bipartisan. Vote NO on #trumpcare debacle for Ohio citizens. Stop #medicaid cuts
Unfortunate to see you sticking up for Mandel's defense of Mike Cernovich... shows your true colors, Senator. We see you.

Wow. Catholic nuns: this is the "most harmful legislation for American families in our lifetimes"; it is "simply immoral" and not pro-life. 
Republican health care plan hurts: Americans with disabilities Seniors Millions of kids

Helps: Millionaires

Who do u represent in Ohio?
bipartisan? Like the healthcare bill being written in secret by the Repubs behind closed doors? Do you know what is in it?
With all due respect: there is a health care vote this week. Please do not vote to repeal. Bipartisan solutions work. We need your help.
I don't know if you plan to support Medicaid roll back. Or letting employer based coverage go back to having lifetime caps. Let us know.
Why can't we fax you @senrobportman ? When will you accept your constituents faxes? Better yet, have a Townhall! We NEED to talk. #Save32Mil
Vote NO on upcoming healthcare vote.  This is a disaster.  Americans deserve more than a tax cut for the 1%!!
How much more evidence do you need from doctors, medical groups,  citizens, & insurers to understand just how cruel this bills is?  VOTE NO!
typical dem gloom and doom if they don't like something democrats the party of wining, fake news followers, snowflakes, anti free speech
We need your YES VOTE NOW..this Victory is so important..wirk on the details later!!!
Republicans always vote for business. Never for us. Must I remind you again that you work for us?
Give Rob a call and tell him to vote NO on repeal and replace: DC Phone: 202-224-3353
Hello? We have questions and comments. Not a good look at the current time.
I seriously hope that you don't let the weird @vp influence your healthcare vote of NO!  You are more popular than him, so no need to!
VOTE NO ON #TRUMPCARE !

Just CALLED PICK UP PHONE Also Critical Tht The PPL of #Ohio want u 2 #VoteNoOnDeathcare 13 Men Hiding in a BASEMENT #pathetic U Work 4 Us
I have 2 kids with preexisting conditions they deserve better!
Vote no this terrible bill. What you are doing is shameful.  You work for the people not pharma or the freedom caucus.
repeal or we replace you
@senrobportman Please, we are begging for our lives- don't repeal. Please work bipartisan, stand up to Trump
This. Because the @WhiteHouse for political agenda, would rather hurt the poor, disabled, children, and elderly- than fix #ACA for all. 
Drugs follow as hope exits, and in large parts of Ohio, hope has been decaying. Pass your portmancare & this epidemic hits closer to home
Repaeal and replace ObamaCare please, it has hurt small businesses like ours.
Vote no on #BCRA motion to proceed. You don't even know what's in the bill. Ohio, including my daughter Evie, deserve better.
I guess you are trying to deflect from the healthcare vote. I hope you will protect Medicaid funding, equal premiums for all
If you tweeted about #healthcare as much as the Republican agenda, you might actually gain support from Ohio.

Pouring rain will not stop the #ADAPTandResist campout to #SaveMedicaid at 1st/Constitution NW at Senate buildings. #ProtectOurCare 
Stop hiding. Republican obcession with repealing ACA is the issue. Fix ACA in bipartisan fashion, don't wreck it!
Fraud.
Hello, Mr. Senator. I'm a Cincinnati small business owner. Please do not vote to repeal ACA, and please stop enabling this president.
REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE!! The plan was to take down the middle !!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqC8jB3m9Bg … What about this?
Majorities across parties say GOP/President Trump are responsible for any #ACA problems going forward
kaiser
A committee of Repubs and Dem create equitable health plan. Don't use M'CAID gut as a way to provide wealthy with tax cuts. Don't do it.
No on Repeal &Replace. Put country above party for a change. Just say "Nyet" to the Putin comrade in the White House
Text "Resist" to 50409 to fax your Senators in addition to calling!
Please vote no on healthcare/ repeal of ACA.
Little evidence for that claim. https://www.propublica.org/blog/item/whats-the-evidence-that-regulations-kill-jobs …
Globalist cuck against Ohio. You have to go, you're worth 14,000,000 dollars no need to have another Hillary...
I pay for and have ACA in Ohio. It's fantastic, affordable. Mess this up If you vote Yes, I look forward to you losing the next election
Blood Money Portman if you vote yes. You know better.
I know the Doctors are telling you that this is bad. My pediatrician has been calling you and mailing you. You know better. Vote No!
Regulatory 'experts'???
Ya know, LOBBYISTS
I will also knock on ever door possible with the 16 members of my family to campaign against you. Promise you!
Promise If you vote yes. I will spend every $ to support any candidate that runs against you. Doctors are even telling you this is no good!
If they want the reforms so bad, why are you pushing so hard AND why has the bill failed so spectacularly every past time?
No one likes this bill any more than your TrumpCare bill.
You are delusional.
Yes! And now is your time to support bipartisan healthcare instead of repeal. A vote for repeal could be your biggest mistake. We will watch
Vote NO on full repeal, vote NO on Trumpcare....make this work for your constituents!

Deregulation takes away our protection against polluters and abusive corporate practices.  It will not help Ohio.
Omg, this is the worst idea ever!  There goes our hope of combatting climate change, financial fraud, etc.

6- What could you possibly negotiate @robportman that would be worth making health care much more expensive for everyone? 
'Regulatory experts'.
Kill the healthcare bill senator! Your people spoke to you last Wednesday! Don't kill us - kill the bill!
When r u going to lock up the treasonous bastard in the White House?
So glad to hear you mention bipartisanship and experts, Sen. Portman. This is the same approach the Senate should use for healthcare reform.

"We won't give up democracy!" over 300 protesters acc. to Police tonight at PL Perm Rep in Brussels#PolandDefendsDemocracy #PulseforPoland

So.  @senrobportman. How are YOU going to vote this week?
13: With no hearings, no full CBO score, no vetting of magical waivers and fake numbers, Senators will vote next week on *something*. END

Trump is shutting down ACA call centers. He's trying to MAKE it fail, making it harder to get coverage on purpose. http://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/20/trump-administration-scraps-obamacare-signup-assistance-in-18-cities.html …
Maybe Senator Collins would be able to tutor you on WHY a multi-billion dollar cut ISN'T GOING TO WORK
12: Collins seems to be the only moderate who understands all of this—even though it’s breathtakingly simple. 
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-07/russians-are-said-to-be-suspects-in-hacks-involving-nuclear-site … what are we going to do about this senator?
There. Is. NO. Extra. Money! Rob.
9: Are you kidding me? Waivers must be budget neutral. There’s no extra $$ there.

8: Here’s the Trump official’s desperate, transparently phony pitch: I’ll give you magical waivers to solve everything.
Your opioid crisis is just going to get even worse. Then again.  Maybe that's what you want?
7: CBO concluded that low-income people would look at this and rationally decide not to buy this junk.

6: Here’s another look at it. Check out the left side of the red line. Via @LorenAdler: 
I would REALLY like to hear how you expect people to pay 104% off their income in OOP costs rob.
5: Here’s the extreme cost-sharing that low-income people moving from Medicaid to Cruz plans would face. Savage. 

4: Look at the pitch again. They’re *slashing* #1 and #2—and #3 does not come close to making up for it. 

3: Here’s the pitch: subsidies can be used to “wrap around” Cruz plans to lower the insane cost-sharing. Via @StevenTDennis: 
Seriously. I won't to know how you are going to vote. I'd like your statement on this.
2: They flipped Portman yesterday. Cassidy? Gullible as ever. 
*want* not won't.
Sunday thought: "The more we care for the happiness of others, the  greater is our own sense of well being." - Dalai Lama....VOTE NO!
Sunday thought: "He who gives to the poor will never want, but he who shuts his eyes will have many curses." Proverbs 28:27....VOTE NO!
Who hates the bill? AARP, AMA & all legit professional groups, GOP  Gov's, Citizens, etc. Insurers call it "unworkable." VOTE NO #Wealthcare
Still waiting for a denial that you've flipped you vote from no to yes.
1: ALERT: Trump admin is using fake #'s to flip moderates— 
saying people can be moved from Medicaid to Cruz plans without harm. Via @WSJ: 
I don't think anyone except GOP is pushing for removing 12 to32 million off of health coverage.
From what I understand, most of those 12-32 mil. don't have HC because they're opting out & paying penalty! Could one of you explain pls?
You "bipartisan" asses created the nonsensical regulatory nightmare w/your ambiguous laws & lack of oversight, now need experts to sort out?

I am not pleased to have a coward representing me in the Senate.
Shame the " experts" in D.C. Aren't for American citizens
HEALTHCARE PORTMAN, HEALTHCARE!

Tell us you're voting NO WAY on the crappy "healthcare" bill!

Make a public NO statement!

#DontRobOurCare

This #veteran and Gold Star widow went to @SenCoryGardner's office to to plead that he vote no on #Trumpcare 

This father is walking from North Carolina to DC to protest Trumpcare––representing his daughter and so many like her who rely on Medicaid: 
Vote no on the terrible healthcare bill. Stand up for the people!

The latest Republican budget proposal, in a nutshell? More tax cuts for the top 1 percent. Cuts for everyone else. 
@SenateDems :
Schumer doubles down on his earlier calls for a bipartisan health care plan 
 
@gop :
I worked w/ Pres Obama to roll back part of Obamacare that was harming vets & now I hope Dems will to the same. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3oKgKEAIDw&feature=youtu.be …
@SenateDems
When GOP rejects false choice of repeal only or #Trumpcare on steroids, we are ready to work on bipartisan solutions that help all Americans
Healthcare experts are against Senate health bill. Will you listen to them and vote NO?

A horrific metaphor for Trumpcare: this disabled woman literally being ripped from her wheelchair. 
#StopTrumpcare  

.@SenatorCollins: GOP health care bill "could lead to insurance plans that really are barely insurance at all." http://abcn.ws/2tfyJkR
