Touring @Burtonmetal with @senrobportman. The Columbus, OH company got a loan through @SBAgov to help it grow! #SBAIgniteTour @SBAgreatlakes 
#GrahamCassidyNO - that's how you should vote if you have any concern for #Ohio
All of the good you do, Portman, will most assuredly be negated by your vote for Graham-Cassidy.
Why aren't you working to get coverage for people in Ohio like @lisamurkowski is for the people of Alaska?
Loosing billions of dollars in federal aid when if vote for #GrahamCasiddy- now THAT is horrible for business. Vote no!
why don't you look forward with working with your constituents? #VoteNOGrahamCassidy

Trumpcare Is #Trumpocalypse-In-Action:GOP Has NO IDEA What #TrumpCare Can Do #Dems #TheResistance #Resist #Trump #RT http://ti.me/2xqQ4rv 
Vote no on that travesty called a health care bill
Earth to @senrobportman come in @senrobportman how are you going to vote on disgusting GrahamCassidy???
#CowardlyPortman
Vote NO on Graham-Cassidy
Red State directors are warning this bill will cause chaos. If you vote yes it will expose your hypocrisy... again. Do you want to kill 32M?
It's almost impressive how you continue posting abt other things to dodge the one issue that literally everyone on here wants a response for
Opioid addiction is a major problem in Ohio; new bill will make it worse. How are you going to vote?
Do you comprehend how cowardly and inept your silence on G-C makes you appear to the people of OH who would be betrayed by your "yes" vote?
Dude.  All 50! Vote NO on #GrahamCassidyBill
#BREAKING: All 50 Medicaid directors come out against GOP bill to repeal ObamaCare http://hill.cm/h25skCt  
KEEP YOUR PROMISE TO VOTE NO ON HEALTH CARE WHICH CUTS Medicare/Medicade!!!
What a joke. McMahan of big-time wrestling fame. It's laughable, until you remember she's part of government. What an embarrassment.
How long will you ignore Ohioans and refuse to even tell us how you'll vote on #GrahamCassidyBill? Do you respect your constituency at all?
#stoptrump
Why won't you talk about healthcare? Why are you hiding?  Is it because you know your yes vote will cause the death of many? Yes. Of course.
Thank you for nothing. You don't care about anyone but yourself and other republicans. You're not a senator representing Ohioans.
No on G-C healthcare bill.  "Do no harm!"
Just what I want is the WWE making rules for my small business. And by the way Leave my health care alone!!!
#KillTheBill
Time for you to take a tour of reality, Rob. Graham-Cassidy tears into every one of your faux concerns.

What kind of cruel, vile soulless people want to misinform American citizens about their healthcare for a legislative victory and tax cuts?
Yes. We've tax abated ourselves in Tiffin to the point of putting an income tax increase on the ballot. Thanks for shifting the burden.
Wouldn't it ALSO be fun if you listened to the concerns of #Ohio citizens regarding their healthcare? I bets lots of people would like that.
Realize why upset re:G-C despite not R or D/ affected by ACA. Male R. Senators like teenage boys-not thinking/packing so don't have to!

how about you join constituents to listen to their concerns about healthcare? You are coming off as a weasel! Vote no!!
Then vote no on G-C bill. Increasing healthcare for small business owners will ruin them. You work for us. Listen to us. #ProtectOurCare
The Governor says NO.  We say NO and the Medicaid Directors from all 50 States say NO.  Time for you to say NO to Graham-Cassidy too.
What about the millions on Medicaid expansion if you vote for this repeal bill ill be voting you out of office against whomever
Worried about Ohio,  but not enough to care about funding for health care?
Wow. A post not about sex trafficking. Impressive. Now tell us where you stand on health care you lobbyist lackey!
Thanks for not listening to the concerns of Ohioans who stand to lose their health insurance because of #GrahamCasiddy.
No to #GrahamCasiddy
NO on #GrahamCassidy. It's as horrible as the previous proposals.
Hey Senator are you doing this too? You voted for him and in any other normal time he'd be out... http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/21/tom-price-private-charter-plane-flights-242989 …
Ohio is concerned about losing 18% of federal funds under Graham-Cassidy. Listen to your constituents. Vote no.
Still pretending that the most significant vote of your career isn't happening, I see.  All of Ohio, and much of America, is watching. "No".
I'm asking you again to vote NO on the Graham-Cassidy Health Care Bill. It's not what the people have been wanting!!
As a small business owner and Ohio resident, listen to my concern...VOTE NO ON GRAHAM CASSIDY!!! Why do we have to keep doing this?!
Your silence on G-C is one of the more cowardly acts of a U.S. Senator in recent memory.
Pretty boy... Ohioans own rival to Ivanka's selfies...

Portman Hints That He'll Support Latest GOP Healthcare Bill http://wosu.pm/2xdyB6A 

This is not a drill. Tell @senrobportman to oppose #GrahamCassidy. Katie Fallon explains how it would hurt Ohioans http://www.dispatch.com/opinion/20170920/letter-health-care-plan-would-cost-ohio … 
This is what matters for the country right now, haven't you noticed?
The Graham-Cassidy bill cuts nursing home care for seniors by decimating Medicaid. It must be stopped. https://twitter.com/ABCPolitics/status/910205588264628225 …
I think your subcommittee oversees this
I'm a small business owner who gets insurance for my family through Obamacare exchange. Will you listen to me and vote no on repeal?
Small business getting screwed with your beloved tax reform!
Will you join us and actually listen to our concerns regarding Graham-Cassidy or can we look forward to more of the same party first frm you
Your office keeps telling me you’re reading the HC Bill. But lots time to tweet abt everything else, apparently. #Lead, don’t #Follow!
You should take time to listen to concerns of #ohio #citizens on healthcare.
Please protect all Ohioans from the latest GOP death bill.  #CassidyGraham is immoral.
#PhotoOpRob back at it. Can't have a town hall...but can pose for a pic all day long! When is the town hall?!?!?!?!? #Disgrace
VOTE NO on new Trumpcare- aka Graham-Cassidy.
Poor social media practice to continue posting, ignoring elephant in the room. Horrendously insensitive to the importance of this issue.
Alaska is getting a deal on this health care bill. Why aren't you  negotiating with Graham? Never mind you'd probably give them back  money!
@SBALinda @Burtonmetal @SBAgov @SBAgreatlakes Not much clearer than this, Rob.  #GrahamCassidy
BREAKING: The bipartisan Medicaid Directors from all 50 states just issued this negative statement about Graham-Cassidy.…
How about listening to all the call concerning the devastation #CassidyGragam will bring to Ohio?
Since you're stonewalling on townhall mtgs, when's your staff going to start answering the phones? Your constituents deserve to be heard.
Vote NO on #GrahamCassidy. Serve #Ohio.  Not the donors. #healthcare #ohio #Republican #Christian #Catholic.
https://t.co/4e9eiFyd2V?amp=1
I can only afford to work at a small business because of the ACA.  This replacement puts too many lives in danger to be considered ethical!
When are you going to start listening to the concerns of all of your 11 million constituents by holding open townhalls?
#StopGrahamCassidy
NO!!! To Graham Cassidy.
I'm your constituent. I want you to vote NO on the Graham/Cassidy bill. If passed, it's going to kill millions of people. Stop the madness!
Did u let the them know that you may take their healthcare away? Jobs mean nothing if all you are doing is working for insurance. #watching
It cuts a net $20 BILLION from Ohio. For every $1 OH spends on Medicaid on average, 63¢ comes from federal $ that #GrahamCassidy would cut.
What about listening to the #disabled who will lose important supports without #Medicaid. Change to NO now. Go bipartisan like @JohnKasich
May God have mercy on your soul for #GrahamCassidy because voters will NOT have mercy on you.
Can you just acknowledge that #GrahamCasiddy exists.  You're on a tweeting spree but overlooking something that will drastically hurt OH
Vote no on GrahamCassidy!!!
When are you going to have a town hall so you can listen to the concerns of your constituents? #FixACA #NOGrahamCassidy
I'm concerned #ohio could lose 2.5 billion in fed funding by 2026 #StopGrahamCassidy
tune in to the rest of us, #noGrahamCassidy
Answer your phones. Calling since July to urge you to vote no. You're not listening to anyone but #KochBros #GrahamCassidyKills
When are you going to meet with people who will lose insurance coverage if you vote for the new Trumpcare bill?
We want HEALTHCARE. Vote no #GrahamCassidy
Did you listen or just tell them what they should think? Kinda like all the responses I get from your office.
Every single health care group is begging Republicans not to do this:
Doctors 
Hospitals 
Insurers 
Patient groups 
Parents
Governors

He'll vote yes. Gotta keep that money lining his pockets. VOTE PORTMAN OUT! He's stealing $ from Medicaid to give tax cuts to the rich 1%.
small biz owners with a pre-existing condition will not be able to afford health insurance if you don't do the right thing

But here's the businesses Rob really cares about:
To see all of Rob's donors, here's the source:
What's your feeling on Healthcare ?

#GrahamCassidy
Avalere, a consulting firm, modeled Graham-Cassidy's cap on Medicaid over time. Look what it does to children and the disabled. SAVAGE. 
@senrobportman What are your views on #GrahamCassidy? Ohioans want to know if you will vote NO to protect our #healthcare.
He's a slam dunk yes vote. He's predictably cynical

"Thanks for distracting from the fact that I'm too chicken to express my support for the patently evil Graham-Cassidy bill."
"Or to meet with voters who haven't been vetted by my staff."
OKAY BUTTHEAD PORTMAN WHY AREN'T YOU LISTENING TO THE PEOPLE OF OHIO HOLD A TOWN HALL TALK ABOUT HEALTHCARE YOU SCREWED US ON THE LAST ONE
