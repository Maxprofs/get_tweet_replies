You do know Trump is the President, correct?
Your constituents are doing the same, you just aren't listening. History is being made. You are on the wrong side. #noDevos

are you just now learning of them? I'm supposed to pat you on the back? How about you vote no to DeVos & then I'll do that
please fight for what is right for Ohio. Do not support nomination of DeVos for our kids education!
Not a word about Trump's equating U.S. and Putin,Bannon ,DeVos,or anything of substance. Why don't you address these issues?
Because that's what Portman always does. Hides on the fringe and is "kept" by party $.
isn't it right to vote no on DeVos to save our kids? Or is the $7800 she gave you stopping you from doing the right thing?
Don't forget to also fight against what is wrong... that being... wait for it... Nancy DeVos. Vote no PLEASE!
so do the right thing on the most incompetent cabinet pick if the bunch.  Show us that you cannot be bought!  NO on DeVos!
Might want to fight for what's right, too. No to DeVos. Have the nerve? I doubt it because money talks and you listen? Yuk.
Please fight for what's right and #DumpDevos
take that inspiration and stand up for what is right. Listen to the people of the US. Vote NO to Betsy DeVos.
Stop acting like a toddler avoiding bedtime. Face your constituents. #DumpDevos #StopDeVos
I sure wish you would have an ounce of their bravery and do the same. Tweets are meaningless; votes matter most.

If you are only now learning these lessons there is little I can say except to quote your @POTUS "Sad!"
you are an honorable man. Please vote against Sessions and DeVos. Neither is #ontherightsideofhistory but you can be.
Why don't you fight for what is right and #votenodevos ?  #countrybeforeparty #PortmanForSale

Be inspired. #DumpDevos
Question is will YOU?  NO on DeVos.  (I'm in 44691)
Hopefully this will inspire you to vote NO on DeVos.
And yet you voted for DeVos.
the men you've named would've never accomplished the great deeds for which they are remembered in DeVos's Education System.
fight for your constituents or at least hear us!  #DumpDevos
and if you want our kids to learn as well you will vote NO on Betsy DeVos.  Our children deserve better #nodevos
and we are fighting for no to Sessions, No to DeVos, and impeachment for Trump!
Fight for Ohio, for America - stand up to Trump and his desire to ally us with Russia. #resist
following your tweets I am astonished that I do not see one of your supporters supporting DeVoss must think she is bad for Ed
I'm so glad you are inspired!!!!  Please inspire your constituents by doing the right thing!!  #DumpDevos!!
please fight for our children and vote no on DeVos!
then how come Devos can buy your vote instead of doing what is right? #devosboughtrob
disheartening to learn of the sacrifices to our kid's education you're willing to make by not voting against Devos
I'm sure you know what's right also but we are not seeing that reflected in how you are voting for Trump cabinet nominees.
I hope you will do what you know is right and fight against the hateful rhetoric being disseminated by your colleagues!
I'm glad u recognize when others are doing the right thing. Maybe u should as well? Vote NO on DeVos and Sessions!
and you are doing their sacrifice a disservice when you choose to have no spine. Vote NO on DeVos
have you learned something from them?  fight for what is right. be there for your constituents. have they found you yet?
Indeed. Please be brave and vote no on DeVos.
You are fighting for OH and voting #noDevos right? great. Be inspired to ignore the 51k she gave you and do the right thing.
Wonderful. Will you fight for what's right? No on DeVos, Pruitt. Bannon off NSC.
Protecting public ed by voting #NotoDeVos would be an excellent way to show that you are willing to fight for what is right.
Exacty! Please do the right thing! Listen to the people! #voteNOdevos
If you are truly inspired, how can you vote yes for Sessions and DeVos? Actions over Words Senator.
do they inspire you to vote #noDevos
while they weren't allowed in the white house at home in America. I'm really starting to think you a tool
So why not fight for what's right in education and vote NO on DeVos?
As you fight to repay DeVos with a "yes" vote that she bought from you?
Please fight for what's right. There can be what looks right on the surface but is wrong beneath. Fight that! No DeVos!
YOU could do that too! Vote NO on DeVos and Sessions!
More important than ever to fight for what is right. Vote no to Devos! #dumpdevos
.@senrobportman agreed, it's why people have flooded your phones and social media posts. Will you fight for what is right and #DumpDeVos ?
Your campaign accepted $51k from DeVos family. Show you have integrity. Stand up and vote #noDevos
@jaketapper @BraddJaffy Please spotlight how this "inspired" admirer translates his awe of justice re DeVos
you will be inspirational to citizens also if you put #CountryOverParty
now let's see you do the same.  You have proven you can and will do the right thing.  Let's see it with education. No2Devos
#WakeUpRob! #DumpDevos #OhioIsWatching! $51K in donations should not trump #Education! #NoDevos #WeWillContinuetoFight
it will be important to remember this during the Sessions vote.
Then please stand against Betsy DeVos. History and your constituents agree it is right.
im sick of the cold shoulder Rob
vote NO on DeVos! Listen to us! You represent us.
Jesse Owens gave the Nazis the middle finger while you defer to white supremacist Bannon SHAME
In my two visits to the new  @NMAAHC, I learned more about Ohioans like Jesse Owens who have shaped our history. #BlackHistoryMonth 
In his latest bit of irony, @senrobportman posts several names that his Ed Sec pick @BetsyDeVos will certainly try to scrub from textbooks.

Let their inspiration be a guide and strength to you.  I'm praying for you, Senator.  Defend our children, women & migrants

Here's a long List of the Information Trump Has Promised to reveal but hasn't
.@senrobportman Guess that is why your constituents are trying to get you to vote no on DeVos
 She is clearly unqualified.
I agree, Senator - that's why I'm fighting against Betsy DeVos and her anti-education agenda. Will you join me? #DumpDevos
what is right, is to vote no on DeVos
Perhaps it might inspire you enough to vote NO on DeVos - fighting for our children is what is right.
We completely agree Senator.  That's why we're fighting against Trump and his awful agenda.  Will you join us? #NoBanNoWall
OPPOSING Devos is the RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY!
Your constituents, on the other hand, remain underwhelmed.
Then get on the right side of history, Senator.
