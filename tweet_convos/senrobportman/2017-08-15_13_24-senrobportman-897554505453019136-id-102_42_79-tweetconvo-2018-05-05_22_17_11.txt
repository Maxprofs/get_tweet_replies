this message is on repeat, if it is so important to you, more innovative ideas please. Widespread education perhaps, teach families safety
and time for republicans to seriously discuss impeachment, this president does not represent the USA and needs to be removed from office.
Racism is not some distant problem.
It's homegrown right here in OH. Egged on by 45*, GOP silence, & @JoshMandelOhio. What are you gonna do?
Trafficking victims & homeless youth are often targeted/victimized by radical groups- e.g., KKK, Nazis, & white supremacists.
Like the ones that gathered in #Charlottesviille. The ones you and #45 won't address.
I was just told about your more recent & direct tweets. I stand corrected. Thank you. Let's keep moving forward- impeachment.
He should name potus as reason for having to make the statement. It is not right to allow potus to not answer for his words.

57,000 slaves in the U.S. today
Kochsucker.

#whitenationalism is not some distant problem. It's happening right here in #Ohio. We have to work together to #endracism #25thAmendmentNow
Trump has confirmed his support of anti American, anti civil rights, anti women, anti freedom.Are you introducing impeachment?

Rob Portman still hiding from Cleveland voters. No Public Town hall in Ohio in 2017!
The Nazi murderer was from Ohio ... ???? Your plan to stop this hate ???
While you continue to bang on this drum, you appear to be ignoring the mad man at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. He's dragging the country down.
Today, the President once again showed us who he really is. "Silence in the face of evil is itself evil." Speak out.
Thank you President Trump for your honesty & courage to tell the truth about #Charlottesville & condemn the leftist terrorists in BLM/Antifa https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/897554574663442432 …
“If you dance with the devil, then you haven’t got a clue, for you think you’ll change the devil, but the devil changes you.”


It's time to remove all civil rights statues. MLK, Rosa Parks, and all other reminders. They offend some of us.
You know who was really into human trafficking Rob? The Confederacy.
Agree. U also need to recognize we have Nazis here in #Ohio and Trump has become their good friend. Do u have moral courage to call him out?
Nazism, too. Break ties with Trump.
Thank you Senator Portman. Keep up the great work.
Really.. really .. is that really all your have to say today!!!!  You are complicit!!!!
Hey Portman it's his job or yours.
I respect your work on the opioid epidemic and human trafficking. When will you stand up to Trump?  He is unfit to serve!  #ImpeachTrumpNow
Notice how Rob Portman sticks his head in the sand any time something major happens and he tweets human trafficking
stop with this as your priority, this country and your constituents need many more important things for you to fight for and prioritize
Psst. Trump is a racist. Prioritize, Rob.
Where is your statement on the nazis in the White House? You know, the leaders of the GOP. Your party. Your Southern stragety has come home.
Trump defended those who marched with torches on the Robert E. Lee memorial.
You issued a statement this weekend condemning white supremacists. It appears the White House is occupied by one. What will you do about it?
I commend your doggedness on this issue, but Right Now something needs to be done about trump before he tears the country apart. Impeach him
Have you noticed what is happening today?  Stop now and start speaking up that this man is insane. You have a greater responsibility!  ACT!
It's happening right here in OH. . .politicians only working to appease a small alt-right base, in fear of the general public at a townhall.
GOP needs to STOP ENABLING Trump
Trump: Setting us all on fire.  
Portman: human trafficking, you guys.
Hey, intern!  Run away!  Far, far away. You will sleep better not supporting this Nazi sympathizer.
I assume that you agree with Trump's support of nazi's, KKK and white supremists, SHAME ON YOU, why are you working to end democracy?
Pure garbage, hatred and bigotry. Your party is done.
45's press conference this afternoon made me weep for America the Beautiful.  Folks,we are watching democracy fade away & die. He is unfit.
Maybe you shouldn't be supporting this president, then. Don't you know his background?
Nothing happens until 45 is gone!  Stand up!  He's an abomination.
Is it important to end human trafficking?absolutely! You know what is more important right now? #ImpeachTrumpNow
Are we sure human trafficking is a problem?  Seems like the President just sided with a group who was really down with human trafficking.
Thanks for your leadership on this issue.
Enough of filling the feed with this-but by all means continue the fight. Now, how did the POTUS you applauded yesterday do today re:racism?
I am thinking you aren't finding many in favor of human trafficking. Pass the law.  The nays will be few to none without unrelated riders.
Shut up rob. Your president is defending nazis
Good God, Man! The President is waffling over Nazis and you are riding this (still important) topic to the end of the republic!
You are politically safe for 6 more years. Grow a backbone and quit enabling the President.
Let's be clear - when David Duke & KKK thank POTUS for his presser, they are thanking you, too - the GOP who stands idly by.
MY OHIO Senator- Please condemn the president
No! Enough with the soft speech! Risk your office! Start the process ! Remove this president!
When are we going to read about your indignation over your President? If you aren't repulsed by this man, you are not representing Ohio.
Whats your thought on the presidents press conference today are you going to say anything about that
WTH how many of the white supremacists were from Ohio!They are terrorists!This needs to stop. This will destroy us! Stand up.Speak up NOW!!!
Senator Portman, you need to comment on the President's deranged defense of white supremacists and Nazis. Now.
Agree, but there seem to be some other pressing things for you to pay attention to today... like the president defending white supremacists

There are not ‘many sides’ to blame for #Charlottesville. There is right and wrong. White nationalism, hatred and bigotry are wrong. -SB
Looking forward to your thoughts on Trump's press conference.
As if he'll offer any thoughts. He's in Trump's pocket and has no spine
True. Don't really expect him to do anything except tweet about drugs.

Trump on Charlottesville: "You had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent." 
Now let's talk about the mad man in the WH and that presser he just gave
You know what else is happening right here in #Ohio? Radicalization of terrorists. What are you doing about that?
Hey the president is siding with Nazis, maybe worry about that?
Nazis - literal Nazis - "blame on both sides" - a woman died #WTF? Will you tweet about that?
Can we finally stop pretending #Trump isn't a racist? #birther
Way to go in avoiding the issues we have been asking you about. You keep pivoting. Can't take the heat?  When is your next townhall? Answer?
Portman is a spineless coward tucked safely in 45's back pocket!
You could substitute climate disruption for every hashtag here. But you do nothing. And help cover for industry hijacking of our government.
Racism is not some distant problem, it's happening right here in #Ohio. You should be addressing nothing but that right now!

WHY are you allowing POTUS to attack US Citizens, affecting vets, elderly, poor, disabled, etc.?  Why do YOU stand by and DO NOTHING?
rob, tell your intern not to tweet while the president is endorsing white supremacists and Nazis on live tv
Did you watch today's press conference? WTF was that?!

You know this is all wrong.

GOP Complicity running this country into the ground.
Neither is racism
Hey, remember when Trump cut funding from the DHS's anti-extremist program, and specifically ended investigation of white supremacists? 
Did you just watch 45s presser? WTF is wrong with the senate? The guy is insane. Do something!!!!! #impeach!!!!

"No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion..." 

#RestInPower Heather Heyer, who gave her life today in defense of liberty and justice for all. We will not forget you. #Charlottesville 
No comment on Trump's unhinged press conference where he defends the right-wing hate groups and compares them to peaceful protesters?
I couldn't find a statement on his website. I called his office & a staffer pointed me to 3 tweets Portman sent out Saturday.

Your silence makes you complicit. Demand that @realDonaldTrump remove Gorka, Bannon, and Steven Miller. #FireGorka #FireBannon #FireMiller
