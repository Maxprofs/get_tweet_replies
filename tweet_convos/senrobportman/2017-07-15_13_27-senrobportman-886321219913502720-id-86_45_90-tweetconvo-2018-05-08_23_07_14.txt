How many millionaires want Wealthcare tax cut vs. assuring Health Care for all?
BREAKING: In rare joint letter, insurers say Cruz amendment "unworkable in any form" and will lead to "widespread terminations of coverage." 
Apparently Trump and his cronies. Do you really want to associate yourself with such overt greed?
The opiate treatment crumbs tossed by McConnell are little more than a bribe.
Vote NO on healthcare if you truly care about your constituents. We don't trust #Trump and we are starting to question the # GOP.  Criminals
If we have an an ally and pledge support and protection it must be enforced with full force Dont talk big words and then walk
The United States must fully support the United States
By supporting Ukraine you punish Russia and help US national security. It's all interconnected.
Yes, support Ukraine. But please don't force #WorseCare down the throats of the American people. Earn a good CBO score & public support!
The Senator from Ohio must fully support his constituents. We need a NO on BCRA.
#SaveMedicaid
#NoCutsNoCaps
#NoBCRA
#FixTheACA
How about you fully support Ohioians?U are so worried about the Ukraine & u can't respond to your voters?U make me sick!!!!
If you support Ukraine, you can't support Putin's puppet of Trump. Don't sell out your constituents & be bribed by McConnell. No BCRA!!!
That plank was removed from the GOP platform at the 2016 convention. You know, when no one was meeting with Russians.
From an ER doctor, this is staggering https://nyti.ms/2tYSsVp 
We know POTUS supports Putin, where do you stand on healthcare?  Any chance of a town hall soon?
I think flat rob is available
How can they when the president is busy supporting #russia and #putin? By supporting him, you're complicit.
Why did @GOP platform change during convention AGAINST US policy to help Ukraine?Was it the pact between @realDonaldTrump &his OWNER, Putin?
You still haven't told us how you're voting on Trumpcare. Please stop waiting and come out first. We need to know how you're voting.
Ohioans on Medicaid need your help, Senator. We beg you to vote no.
Even you at long last have to see the absolute indifference you portend to be against, just not by name. Take a stand
Your Gov doesn't think much of Pence lying about healthcare..how do u feel Senator? Asking for Ohio
Never going to happen with the Trump/Putin love fest in full swing.
I'm embarassed that you are my Senator when you tweet five time as often about Ukraine's protection than our own protection from Russia!

Cancer survivor shares with staffers of GOP Rep. Lamar Smith a powerful story about how Obamacare helped extend the life of a friend. 
Support Ukraine; expel Russia from Ukraine; stop Russian aggression
How can that be done with Russia supporters in the White House? Pick country over party. #NoTrumpCare #ImpeachTrump
But once again the million dollar question is will @Potus comply & risk pissing little "buddy" @PutinRF_Eng off! @POTUS44 didn't  even do it
How can you support Ukraine when you have a Russian puppet in the Oval Office, while Tillerson dismantles the DoS?!
Senate & House members can do that by impeaching those that colluded w/Russian govt. & forcing McConnell and Ryan to uphold their sworn duty
Then please tell your president that his buddy Putin needs to get out
Treasonous @realDonaldTrump's biggest supporter in Congress.... you guessed it, @senrobportman!!! 

#PortmanRussia
Sad
We ought to start by fully supporting ourselves against Russian aggression. But what do I know.
Yet GOP weakened its stance on Ukraine in its party platform at the request of Russia. I never heard you speak up. Russian collusion GOP
Support Ukraine! Full repeal only on Obama care!
Maybe that's what Trump's idiotic son was discussing with that Russian lawyer...
Support and protect us.
If you really believe that, then you should NOT support Trump.

Even Republican governors are calling Pence a liar now.

on this we agree.   Russia is being brought to trial by both the Dutch and Ukraine in The Hague courts.
How about supporting America? #RevokeKushner
I will never vote for u 
Agreed! Our president doesn't

This cancer survivor can't speak, but that won't stop him from speaking up against Trumpcare 
Not talking about healthcare ? Thats because your rate with the dems !
tell that to @realDonaldTrump
Trump hinted he was willing to recognize Russia’s annexation of Crimea as part of a grand bargain that would include lifting some sanctions.
no we dont, quit throwing us under the bus senator portman
Then do something about your hero trump!
No!
The "Countering Disinformation And Propaganda Act" was a good step.  Need more like that.. but unlikely pres would sign.  #VoteNoBCRA
Vote no on bcra!
Please put your knowledge and passion on this topic to work on discovering why our POTUS is so attached to Vladimir Putin.
How can the US fully support Ukraine, when Trump fully supports Putin?
VOTE NO ON BCRA
Plz protect your constituents from #Trumpcare. 

@realDonaldTrump has filed 6 bankruptcies.  
He survived, but can they?

#VoteNo
By "reports" you mean propaganda pushed by the Kremlin and their useful idiots like Hannity?
No credibility until you and Repub. colleagues take action on Russian interference.  This is bigger than party politics. #ohio
My grandfather reminded me as I celebrate how GR8 the USA became by 1955.
I said," We are No 1"
"Of course! We R THE ONLY 1 STILL standing"


You have an odd obsession with Ukraine given you're supporting the Putin Preferred Potus. 
How's that work exactly?
How about you fully support .@POTUS & USA FIRST, then we'll talk about other places. Else, just stay home & pull invasive honeysuckle & pud.
How do you support the Ukraine when you support the Kremlin.? The Kremlin runs the White House and your happy about it
Putinbot.
Does this mean the folks in Alaska have more value than the rest of us?
Tell your president and the rest of your party that overtly or through inaction support the Putin regime. @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @POTUS
You must fully support the USA! Be the standout America needs! Ohio is watching sir!

Russia?
Why? Why must we? Why is it the job of the US to police any other countries' problems?

Police Chief Probst (Star City): Medicaid cuts will force West Virginians to wait for opioid treatment. “That’s not going to help anybody” 
Ha!! Tell the PRESIDENT!!
Support America
The Republican Party, fighting for Trump's bold, "America First" agenda, like letting the Kremlin run the White House.
Start by investigating Russian ties and #revokekushner
