You can write all the "compassionate" editorials you'd like, dismantling Medicare will exponentially make this epidemic worse.
GOP & compassionate together? Should be; GOP & malevolent intent
Even Bill Kristol thinks GOP will regret #TrumpCare
Bill Krystal really

Republicans may be able to separate themselves from Trump after his fall. They won't be able to distance selves from their own health law.
The GOP meltdown to come-may it last a very long time
That is my hope!!
This is a glorified troll account
.@senrobportman don't drug addicts need health care, mental health care, rehab clinics?  Vote no on tax break for wealthy. Medicare for all
$792,645
Remember this #
It's how much Portman took from big pharma/healthcare
You wrote #ACHA, vote no now
We will vote NO on you
How are you going to do that without Medicaid Rob? And how are you going to get people back on their feet without jobs; THE main problem?
But yet in secret you drafted a healthcare bill that goes against everything you say in your op-ed.
In my latest op-ed in @daytondailynews, I discuss how the #STOPAct is needed to help fight back the drug epidemic:http://www.mydaytondailynews.com/news/opinion/opinion-from-rob-portman-congress-must-more-fight-drug-crisis/SNrXOrp3jc4hdkSVyXwqNO/ …
The Senate healthcare bill hurts the battle against the opioid crisis.It takes away protections for mental health& addiction services.
The healthcare bill will devastate effforts to fight this epidemic.
The storify from Fridays tweetstorm on #HealthcareMatters #ACA #AHCA #BCRA  Important to see these stories.
Sad that you will condemn poor elderly, children and disabled people to lose health insurance. This is #GOPAmerica
Know what else is needed? Medicaid. It's one of the best tools. And Trumpcare would kill it, and Ohioans would die. Vote NO.
Your platform lately is to help those with addiction problems. Yet, the AHCA drastically cuts funding to assistance programs and prevention.
Access to addiction treatment services via comprehensive health insurance is needed to help fight back the drug epidemic #VoteNoBCRA
50% of all addition and rehabilitation services in OH are paid for w/ Medicaid. Please vote NO on AHCA.
Please Senator, vote no on #TrumpCare-America is looking to you for leadership Please step up!! The Senate healthcare bill cuts Medicaid
CONSTANTLY DEFLECTING...AHCA IS POISON!
This being true, you CAN'T support the Senate #WealthTransferBill. Not voting=depraved indifference; voting YES=accessory to murder.
The Senate healthcare bill cuts Medicaid, leaving many caught by the opioid epidemic w/o http://care.Vote  no.
Let's see...so far you have thrown Ohio's kids under @BetsyDeVosED 's Dominionist school .  Kicked civil rights to the curb circa 1950s...
with @jeffsessions and his white sheets. Silenced @SenWarren via @SenateMajLdr 's misogyny. And now? What's it going to be now, Rob?
You conspired to write this abhorrent "death panel" bill. It's cruel. It's heartless. It's going to kill...children...the elderly...
the poor. Thousands of your constituents will ultimately suffer and probably die bc of this hateful, vicious, vindictive, vendetta against..
@BarackObama and the Affordable Care Act. @SenateMajLdr has fooled no one. Absolutely no one and he's had this in the crosshairs for...
eight spiteful years. It's nauseating. You have a choice. You have a choice to find your conscience. You have a choice to be respected..
You have a choice to show you character. You have a choice to do the right thing because it's the right thing to do. Your choice, Rob...
Please truly help Ohio Vets, children, elderly & the most vulnerable! Vote NO on the #ReverseRobinHood bill, I mean #Trumpcare!! Thank you!
You have a net worth of $8.8 million.  Of course you want tax cut called healthcare.  VOTE NO TO TRUMPCARE FOR CONSTITUANTS
Great article and I agree! Though, the latest Trumpcare bill seems to do the opposite. How do you reconcile these positions? Politics?
If you vote for this Bill, you will live with the knowledge you caused preventable deaths. Death will be your life's legacy?
For what? Tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. Is that really why you got into politics? To hurt vulnerable people?
Medicaid helps too, heard of it?
I implore you to vote against the Healthcare Bill. Healthcare is too important for too many. We need a bill that covers more people not less
This is your chance to work for Ohio and work for your constituents.  Vote No lose your seat!
we need more medicaid funding NOT LESS to fight against drugs! Why don't YOU donate some of that 385k that you rec'd from big pharma comps?
And kellyanne conway, speaking for the WH said money isn't the answer, addicts need willpower
Make treatment providers accountable for every $$ they spend on actual treatment not just their salaries and bonuses.
I can only support the increased bed legislation if you also enact oversight to treatment providers that are rushing addicts thru for more $

Agreed: Congress must do more to stop opioid crisis. You should start by voting NO on BCRA to stop Medicaid cuts for OH #ProtectOurCare
Sen. Johnson on why he's voting for Trumpcare: he thinks vulnerable people should pay more. 

Do you agree? 

Your vote will be your answer.
Trump Care drastically cuts funding for the Opied Crisis @davidfrum @tribelaw @PreetBharara
Repeal only!!!!!!
You cannot help eradicate the addiction by cutting Medicaid when 60-70% of pain clinic patients are enrolled. You're going to kill people.
if you vote yes on the Senate nohealthcare bill, you will have signed a death warrant for 10,000s ofOhioans.
Trumpcare will take this away no help for the drug epidemic,  no help for anyone poor!
How many hearings did the stop act get?
Must you keep up this charade? We know you'll never vote no on AHCA. Party before country.Quit using the drug epidemic as a distraction.
Especially since he was one of the 13 who crafted the damn bill
In my latest tweet, I plead ask @senrobportman to keep the #AHCA from making the #opioidepidemic worse.
This vote will either be your undoing or keep you in your seat. You choose. We vote. You work for us. This is a professional threat #voteno
ur vote holds thousands of ohioans, ur peoples lives, in jeopardy. we WILL die! opiod epidemic commendable, trumpcare vote deplorable
Any Senator who votes for a bill with no hearings that impacts countless helpless Americans deserves to be voted out of office.
You're simply another sycophant. Sad for you and sad for the helpless in this country who truly need medicaid to thrive and go on living.
And you will use this as your excuse for voting yes when the undemocratic regime calls upon you.Especially when McConnell plays his game.
How do you plan to that and cut Medicaid at the same time?
#UniversalHealthcare
Please choose your constituents over your Party. This vote will be your legacy. Did you really get into politics to hurt people?
How about you STOP avoiding your constituents? Maybe hold and actual townhall, not a corporate retreat.
Do you really want leaving thousands of Ohio's citizens more vulnerable to be your legacy? We'll remember how you voted when the cuts come.
Medicaid is needed to fight addiction- access to healthcare #VoteNoACHA
What is your interpretation of #Medicaid under the new bill? #NoCutsToMedicaid #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare
.@SenatorCollins to @GStephanopoulos: "The Senate bill is going to have more impact on the Medicaid program than even the House bill." 
Anything but a No vote on Senate health bill means you are voting to kill opioid treatment. Vote No the bill is bad for Ohio.
Yeah, @senrobportman is voting for the Senate bill. He's going to get some money for opiod addiction, declare victory, and reward the Kochs.
Yup, sickening. http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2017/06/trumpcare_is_right_where_republicans_want_it.html …
