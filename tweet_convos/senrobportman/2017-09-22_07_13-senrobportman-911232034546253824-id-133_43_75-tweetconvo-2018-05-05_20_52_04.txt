SO IS #GrahamCassidyBill
Please vote no on Graham Cassidy.  

And help end human trafficking.
It's horrible and I'm glad you stand against it. Survivors will need affordable healthcare for physical & mental harm.
So you are going to vote "no" for the new health care bill so people with PTSD from rape and trafficking can get treatment, right?
Healthcare repeal is the stain we're focused on in America. Why do you continue to ignore this?
The video grabs my heart. The videos on why every healthcare agencies and systems are against the Graham Cassidy bill grabs my heart. V NO
Human trafficking is bad. But still vote no on Graham Cassidy bill

I agree, it is horrible; but this distraction isn't working. Vote no on #GrahamCassidy!!!
And so is leaving Americans without health care. Raise taxes, and we can do a lot!
As is the absence of #healthcareforall Vote NO on #GrahamCassidy
Agreed. Now, let's talk about healthcare.
Human trafficking is bad. Depriving millions of people of health care and removing protections for preexisting conditions is also wrong.

People without health care is a stain on our nation. Vote no on Graham-Cassidy .@senrobportman

failing to protect your constituents from Graham Cassidy is a stain on your personal character. #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
Absolutely agree. And taking healthcare away from millions of Americans would be a stain as well. Let's be morally coherent, @senrobportman
Morally coherent...great term!
And someone who will take needed healthcare away from his constituents is also a stain on our national character.
So is failure to repeal and replace.  Get to  work.
What about the #GrahamCassidyBill ?? You've said nothing?? You better vote no I swear
So are you @senrobportman
Will Graham-Cassidy cover the healthcare needs of victims? Don't broaden the stain. Vote "NO" on G-C healthcare bill!

I wish our Republican Senator had an independent voice.  Rather embarrassing to watch Republican leaders "bribe" Alaska but not Ohio.
Senators too cowardly to face their constituents regarding one of the most important votes in US history are a stain on our Republic.
#GrahamCassidyBill is a stain too. VOTE NO PLEASE.
Rest assured @senrobportman is a guaranteed no vote on #Trumpcare2 unless himself and his family are exempt from the exclusions
rest assured: never. but fingers crossed. there are some reports that the AK-HI amendment pisses him off.
Think of the stain on your character that a "yes" on Graham Cassidy would bring.

A Congress with 18% approval is a stain on our national character, Senator Portman. Start by supporting my President!
Dropping bombs on multiple countries is a stain on our national character. Adding 700 billion to our twenty trillion in debt is a stain.
Taking insurance away from Americans is also a stain. Represent Ohio, not the GOP. We will remember in 2022
dad makes $90k a Mom makes $90k YET a gov Funded Paycheck pays 1/2  of #SS medicare Tax than a #Gov #Employee that makes $180K, its #THEFT
Please be my hero and vote NO on the rushed health care Bill. My 50 yr old wife has stage 4 breast cancer. Meds are $11,500/ mo. Save Ocare.
As is the GOP’s relentless drive to strip millions of healthcare
SESTA is not about trafficking. It's about taking away freedoms online for the average citizen. Nothing else.

The fact that I have to call you every fre months to beg you not to kill my healthcare is a stain on YOUR character!
You know what else will be a stain on our national character? The Republican quest to deprive millions of Americans of their healthcare.

lol
If you are gonna vote against Ohioans, can you at least negotiate for us? Can we get the Alaska deal for Ohio?
What you are about to do to healthcare, but publicly claiming to be 'on the fence' is beyond a stain, but a huge blot!
1,060.
You have NO character sir for supporting #GrahamCassidy
Please show your moral character by voting NO on Graham Cassidy
You honestly think Portman has moral character? Hahahahahahaha.....
Stain on our national character  - Look in the mirror Rob
Your votes to strip medical insurance from the most vulnerable Ohioans is YOUR stain on our national character.

So is taking healthcare away from 32 million people. And eliminating Medicaid.
The safest prostitutes are the legal prostitutes. MMA boxing and football are ok with you but not prostitution? You are a hypocrite.
Another stain would be passing #GrahamCasiddy

A Senator who will not fight for healthcare for his state is a stain on humanity.
Koch officials said network’s midterm budget for policy & politics is between $300m & $400m but not unless ACA ripped by Graham-Cassidy
