I LOVE YOU KYRIE
When its all said and done everyone will shift back to Lebron and say "Lebron James is the greatest player" ..Irving tho
lebron 8 games > irving 1
No matter what Lebron basically closed out the Celts 15 in the fourth quarter he was as important as Irving was
Thank goodness for Kyrie 42 points

Michael Jordan would of been done with these banged up Celtics.  Lebron and the Cavs struggling like a mofo.  Pathetic, the king is fishy.
