And then vote NO, Senator
What are your feelings about single-payer? It's growing in popularity! Would you support it?
And you will still conclude that it dumps millions from Medicaid. Shameful.
Talk w/Ohio PCMH & ACO practices. They are lowering costs while improving Ohio outcomes. PriMed, OSU, MetroHealth, Blanchard Valley. Vote NO
Tax cuts for rich to yank care from seniors, disabled and poor. So Christian like. Shameful. Shameful Shameful. Ohio says heck no!
Please do not vote yes!!!
Vote  No.!!!!stand up. History will serve you well.
Senator, if there is no CBO score before the vote, you must vote NO, regardless! Score from any other source not acceptable.
And you will do what is right, not profit based we hope.
Vote no! funding for opiad treatment will do nothing with the deep cuts to Medicaid and lead Ohio deeper into this epidemic
CBO score won't include Cruz amendment.  Will you demand it does prior to the vote?
Why did you & @SenateGOP vote to exclude your own health benefits plan(s) from the provisions, restrictions, cuts in the Bill? Unfair!
Just vote on whatever @RandPaul says to
Will you then sit on the fence and not speak up until Mitch pulls the bill?  #SAYNONOW
CBO info or not you should be able to see that this will negatively affect Ohioans.
Cuts Medicaid and eliminates planned parenthood funding. Awful for mothers and babies in OH. I expect more from the party of family values.
My friend lives in his moms basement in Dayton. He can work but is on Medicaid. Doesn't pay a dime and medical cost. Is that a good plan!￼
First, you don't sound like a very good friend.
Second, there are many reasons a person may be on Medicaid and that differs state to state, so can't really determine if its a good plan.
Many reasons yes but most of those reasons are not legitimate and do not should not require Medicaid
Please vote no...millions of Ohioans hope you will do the right thing...
Republican want a win?? Well if that win cost most Americans to lose healthcare... is it really a WIN???
You were slow to say NO last time. We are watching!
Come up with a plan...Middle class would like to be able to see a Dr. and have insurance pay for it like it was prior to Obama care
My 4 children need their mom. Passing this bill takes me away from them. Harsh reality. My story is like thousands of others u represent #NO
I understand you don't want commit if you don't have to, as long as when the vote comes it's a no.
Vote NO! This bill is a killer!

#AHCAkills #AHCAisImmoral
#TrumpLies #TrumpRussia
The one you supported until it was clear that it wasn't coming to a vote? And then you opposed it? That bill? #hypocrite #QuitYourJobRob
The CBO is worthless, so what's the point?
I'll review it too and also how you vote on it! We are watching your every step dude. Ohio is hanging it all on you to do the right thing!
We need you to support universal healthcare - no one left out.
Let me save you some time & trouble, Senator: the #BCRA keeps getting worse: https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-new-senate-health-care-bill-may-be-worse-than-the-old-one/2017/07/13/9aaffc18-680e-11e7-8eb5-cbccc2e7bfbf_story.html?utm_term=.d18dc9ec8ac5 … #VoteNoBCRA
Fraud.
Vote no. Stop hedging. This isn't all pomitical theater. People will hurt.
Fight the fight. LTC is counting on you and so is the population that we take care of through Medicaid dollars! Vote no. We must do better.
Please vote no for all Ohioans. You and the republicans can work with democrats for a better solution that doesn't kick 22m off insurance
The people of Ohio do not want this.
Call R. Portman at 1-800-205-6446 or 614-469-6774 Provide your first& last name and zip. Use manners let him know your concerns. #Trumpcare
It still hurts those who need Medicaid and with pre existing conditions. We Ohioans need you to protect us.  Improve ACA don't start over.
You know Ohioans deserve better - vote no!
Anything that cuts #Medicaid is a bad idea. #NoTrumpCare
Just say NO to bad legislation!!!!
So this sure better not include viagra!
Thanks for letting us know this. New Bill exemption written in for Congressmen, scrap birth control mandate - not good Senator.
@GOP is so happy they get to call the shots they are ignoring basic human compassion. You are on the wrong side of history
If Uallow this 2pass w/this crooked administration you have no soul.U know it too.Your hoping it gets worded shrewdly & it slithers through
U actually think middle class will survive this?bare bones health ins,a tax cut for the wealthy,cuts to Medicaid & we're an expansion state?
Just stop. There is nothing in this legislation that changed enough to pass it and you know it
Much easier and less noisy than listening to the real people effected by this bill and your decision. Distance makes heart less involved?
The CBO really? The never get it right
All talk.
You haven't reviewed it yet??? Your own party hasn't provided it yet? 

Sounds legit.
Didn't you help write it?
And then I hope you will vote no again as this is garbage too!

The Cruz part of the bill will remove my pre-existing conditions protections.  Vote NO!  I'm a constituent from Medina, OH 44256.
But will you act on what matters to the people or the wealthy?
Ah. So Mitch will let you read it BEFORE the vote?
@OHDems @TopherSpiro @ASlavitt Sen Portman, imperative for you to vote No on motion to proceed on #BCRA we have no Cruz amendment CBO score!
CBO score on FULL bill ( including the ludicrous Cruz amdt) or NO vote. That was your good commitment to us.
Fix ACA!
And if you have a shred of moral fiber you will vote no. Nothing meaningful has changed. It still hurts the poor to help the rich.
I'm confused...aren't you a member of the committee writing this legislation, yet you need to review the text? You're stalling. #RESIST
You know anything McConnell approves is going to be bad for the people of Ohio that aren't millionaires & there's a lot of us. 45044
Since you are one of the bill's architects, we won't hold our breath waiting for you to act responsibly. You wrote a heartless bill, Rob.
As a retired army officer, Robs bill would force me to use the underfunded and poor quality VA hospital.
Healthcare needs repealed. Its unconstitutional for government to try to run. Healthcare is not a right and needs to be free market.
And then, hopefully, you'll put the best interest of Ohioans ahead of special interests, campaign donors, and your party line. Right?
I just called C bus office and they had no idea if Cruz amendment now included would be scored- will it be ?
The entire Republican Party is engaged in a massive coverup operation of a President engaged in Treason.

Pass it on.
It's sickening that you lack the courage to stand against your party when a bill comes to you that is awful for Ohioians.
Made even more sickening by the fact that you cast yourself as a champion for fighting opiod addiction.
Tell me: how does gutting Medicaid help those suffering from addiction? How does it make sure those addicts get the help they need?
#RepealObamacare
#CBOSCORE is flawed no matter what. You need to decide based on freedom.
Please vote NO on it. Save this Ohio voter's life. Just learned I have 4 infections from a tick bite that are going to be tough to treat.
And you'll vote for it regardless because party over country. #wealthcare
Do better
So, Susan Collins says, NO. Medicaid cuts still too much.
Again Senator, please vote no for Ohioans! Be brave, be a hero, no room for politics!

BREAKING: Congressional Budget Office refutes White House claim that Trump plan would balance budget within decade.
McConnell isn't waiting for new CBO. VOTE NO
Why not use a think tank to design health care. All politicians are useless
If this new bill will leave Ohioans with fewer affordable healthcare options, you must vote no.
And what criteria will you use for review? Where's your exact line? How much money for babies are you willing to cut?
So much worse than Obamacare, you can't even THINK about voting for this horrible bill. Tell the Senate they can do a better than THAT.
I feel like you are just putting us off. You know not much has changed.
Please vote NO. Medicaid is NEEDED by many and has nothing to do w/ the ACA exchanges. Don't gut Medicaid and say it's to help exchanges
@SenateMajLdr won't wait for #CBOSCORE  for #BCRA  The people get mad when they realize they are being cheated. #SaveOurCare #SaveMedicaid
@SenSherrodBrown has already reviewed it and knows it is a disaster. Your non-position is not #howtoshowrobcares
The bill would end the Medicaid expansion and replace it with just $45B to address the opioid crisis in the entire country for 10 years. 
start by saying you will insist that Congress has the same healthcare that is in this bill.
Here's a great review of the bill's changes, Senator.  Vote no and protect the healthcare of your constituents.

 Here are the consumer protections the Cruz amendment wipes out: 
You may want to listen to your constituents,  medical professionals, and various health organizations as well.
All of the amendments won't be in the CBO score. How dumb do you think the majority of your constituents are, Rob?
The $45billion for OH & WV opioid crisis is chump change. McConnell's carrot & stick.
#FakeAmericans #Christians #Hypocrites
#NoConscience
Translation: "I'm going to bide my time and hope this bill goes away on its own so I won't have to take a stand either way"
Please keep the best interests of your ppl at . We r counting on u to help those that need it most. Thank u! Go Bucks!
Ohioans have benefited from ACA . Ask Gov. Stabilize markets and fix so Ins companies return and operaye competitively.
And what are you looking for? What specifics would be acceptable? Just waiting for braver GOPs to make the decision for you like last wk?
We'll save you the time. The objections you had have not changed.
What politcal courage...
No public hearings?  You should vote NO!
What if there's no CBO score, @senrobportman? Partisan agency score unacceptable. Please speak out!
Everything you have said has been a lie.  You vote straight party line.  Your constituents mean nothing to you!
we'll be watching
And vote no
How abt just voting no 4 the sake of integrity  & transparency. No hearings=no vote. Or were u lying when u said u wanted an open process?
From your website. Do you call BCRA not ramming a bill through Congress? If BCRA passes, you'll only need to change the year.
And I hope you vote NO.
And you'll withhold a vote without CBO review, right? None of this HHS garbage.
Thank you, Senator. Please let your constituents review as well, as is the American way. I'm from LaGrange.
This vote may literally determine whether people live or die. Please vote no.
Hey look! @SenSherrodBrown ACTUALLY TALKED TO CONSTITUENTS ABOUT THIS BILL!!!!
I’m ready to work with Republicans to lower costs and make healthcare work better, but that’s not what this bill does. My full statement: 
Wait a second, you're going to actually read it and use objective data? That's refreshing. Wish @RepSteveStivers had been as conscientious
And you will do whatever you determine is in your best interest.
Put Ohio before party. Do the right thing , work with the democrats so we can move past healthcare. Healthcare needs to be bipartisan.
Republican base will remember the promise to repeal Obamacare and vote accordingly
Experts have weighed in w/their thoughts on the new bill. When will you? Will you hold public forum to get Ohio input? Don't sell out!
VOTE. NO. VOTE. NO. VOTE. NO. VOTE. NO. VOTE. NO. VOTE. NO. VOTE. NO. VOTE. NO. VOTE. NO. VOTE. NO. VOTE. NO. VOTE. NO. VOTE. NO. VOTE. NO.
You should join Senate Collins in saying #NoBCRA  when there won't be any hearings. Debate is not enough. Thank you, @SenatorCollins.
Not taking your word for this as you have proven to be a party line voter! Please prove me wrong!
If you want our vote when you run again, you need to vote for the Senate Healthcare Bill. There is not going to be a perfect bill.
Please vote no.  I just keep crying over the cruelty in this bill, harm to myself and others,  the shameful non-democratic process.
Gospel of CBO is fraught with inaccuracy
CBO scores have been wrong lately
Rob don't go back on ur word.  U have promised for years.  It's time to repeal & replace.
Will there be a CBO score?
God Bless the internet:
Didn't you WRITE the last version?  How about just stop trying to ruin millions of people's lives?
Ohioans do not share Speaker Ryan's view of the world, and nor should you.
You know it's garbage. Just commit to a no on this bill in any form. Vote no on #Trumpcare
Stop pandering to dems. If you say no, for all practical purposes, you are done in Ohio.  Pursue the will of the people and not the loudest!
Please go against it BEFORE it's dead, not after. Don't be a bandwagoner.
Will you at least make sure they get an actual CBO score and not a partisan HHS analysis?
"and just like last time, I'll make my decision when it is moot and politically convienant."
NOT the HHS analysis.
To not even let the bill go to the floor for debate is ridiculous do your job and debate it
Will you wait until the bill is dead to come out against it?
And when the CBO score shows that it will cause millions to lose coverage while increasing out-of-pocket costs, how will you vote?
Just do the right thing for Ohioans.  Vote no.
Be a NO. For the good of our state, please be a strong no!
All indications are that Medicaid cuts/phase-out are unchanged. No reason to be anything but firm "no" at this point, Senator. Courage!
Will you insist on a CBO score?
