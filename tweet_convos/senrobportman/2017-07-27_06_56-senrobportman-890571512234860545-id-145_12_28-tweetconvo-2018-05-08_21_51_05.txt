We don't want the government dictating our healthcare! Repeal And Replace Obamacare like you Republicans promised during the elections!
You'd rather millions didn't have health care & that it was a privilege of the wealthy rather than a right for all? #obamacare
As usual, you're conflating health insurance with health care. Forcing someone to buy something is not freedom.
Surely somet wrong when USA richest nation on earth & yet millions without heath care/insurance? And worst overall!!
I'm sure U'll have noticed that #NHS (single payer system) is 1st again. It's a system we Brits R immensely proud of as works 4 many not few
You need to lead the way to a bipartisan effort to make the necessary changes to make the ACA WORK PROPERLY. #leadershipgoals
Senator I would like to know when you will start having "Town Hall"meetings for us. Not the normal "corporate donor"Town Hall you hold.

Over 70% of Americans want a bipartisan fix to ACA, including 72% of independents.  VOTE NO on terrible skinny repeal plans!
70% of Americans would prefer that people don't post the same tweet over and over and over... how much did the healthcare industry pay you?
your vote was shameful and Ohioans will not forget that you voted to strip away healthcare fro 16MILLION people and increase insur premiums
Not sure if you got the right message on Healthcare. If you repeal and replace ACA make it better not worse. That includes lower costs too!

Portman refuses to meet with constituents in Ohio or even let them into his offices to speak with staff @maddow @usatodayDC @DispatchAlerts
Vote NO to repeal #ACA!
Very unfortunate that you lied to Ohioans by not voting to repeal #Obamacare when you had the chance to do so.  Why?
Please do not vote for any part of a repeal. Work across party lines to fix what is wrong w/ACA. "Skinny repeal" hurts seniors & vulnerable.
Don't worry @senrobportman this vote won't haunt you for rest of your political career, when 14M lose care by next year & premiums skyrocket
"I voted for it before I voted against it. " I also voted to EXEMPT myself & all Government employees from Obamacare. Constituents are dolts
You are opening the door to massive Medicaid cuts. Cornyn says so. You've been warned. You should stand with OH.
John Cornyn says Senate passing "skinny" repeal would NOT block far-reaching changes in conference cmte because House bill's scope is broad.
#VoteNo on the #SkinnyRepeal! An estimated 20% increase in premiums will NOT meet your requirements. #OH14
Portman is a Rino 
Portman refuses to meet with constituents in Ohio or even let him into his offices to speak with staff @washingtonpost @nytimes @CNNPolitics

pure BS... most of those people don't even want health insurance they were forced into it with an IRS fine
How did it feel to listen to your constituents legitimate, earnest concerns & then plan to completely abandon them to benefit your donors?
Do not vote for that Skinny bill. Why is GOP so opposed to spending our tax money on us?they damn sure don't care to give it to the rich!
My perfect sister was borth with autism. ACA has helped so much. Please don't vote to kill people today.
Obamacare is a disaster

Still haven't seen the GOP health care bill we are voting on. Is this really how the GOP wants to conduct business on people's health care?
You need to be voted out of office...You are no different than John Kasich....Pathetic
you sold out your constituents with your yes vote on the "skinny" repeal. You're showing your true colors. 45177
Swallow your pride & #SaveACA.
How about that town hall?What if your family was too poor for health insurance? Would you want rich a-holes taking it so they get tax cuts?
Please insist that the Senate produce a real replacement on #healthcare, not an empty vessel that will go to conference w/o a plan.
Dude... Thanks for your work... Sincerely... However... At what point do you address...
Please vote no on this skinny repeal!
I am surprised you didn't vote for single payer isn't that what you want
Why did you bar constituents in Columbus from entering your office to fill out comment cards/wait to speak with a staffer earlier this week?
Did you talk about your #FlipFlop on getting rid of Obamacare?
How about having a Buckeye coffee open to the public IN OHIO???
I see you got $80K from Big Insurance, and killed clean repeal. We will not forget. http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2016&cid=N00003682&type=C …
The Dems set health care on fire & the country couldn't rely on you to help thoughtful republicans put the fire out. #shameful
Please don't fall for the drop in the bucket funding McConnell is promising you for the opioid crisis. Millions will lose HC.
Put people's lives above political party
Whilst you were out having coffee, nobody was in the office answering constituent telephone calls.
Stop being a coward, do a town hall and face your constituents. Vote no. 43209.
Uvoted4 repeal in 2015 knowing it was an effort in futility, bt against repeal whn you had Pres that would sign it.Not good representation.


Senators, Repeal and Replace the ACA today. The President has given you momentum. Don’t squander it. Income tax… https://ifiwerepresidentiwould.wordpress.com/2017/07/27/senators-repeal-and-replace-the-aca-today-the-president-has-given-you-momentum-dont-squander-it-income-tax-replacement-and-a-balanced-budget-is-next-dont-lose-your-momentum/ …
You are part of the biggest lie in American political history.
Did the healthcare lobbyist influence you?
Interesting that The State Department, with huge anti-#HumanTrafficking roll is being dismantled as you tweet.  Vote NO on anti#healthcare
#VoteNo on #SkinnyRepeal !!!
Please read don't lie!!
"Skinny repeal” would unravel the individual market, exacerbate affordability issues critics are trying to address. http://spr.ly/60108s7vQ  
How's GLRI? Your posts consistently cite how you got back $50 million from Obama, let's see your results with your GOP POTUS & EPA Pruitt!
Please show some compassion for Ohioans and do not vote on the ‘skinny repeal’.
Do what you promised..FULL REPEAL. .get government out of health care. ..let the free market run

This makes all the major insurance associations opposed. https://twitter.com/jrovner/status/890597282000900098 …
constituent from 44106 - make sure you vote no on Skinny Bill. It's a terrible deal for Ohio.
hey, how about a buckeye coffee with us next time you're actually in the buckeye state? holding them in DC only is a joke.
also curious if you plan to stand by 45* when his biz involvements in human trafficking come fully to light. maybe smart to just bail now??
Have coffee with us in Ohio instead of with just those who have the $ to travel to/stay in DC.

TRAITOR! Voted for R&R IN 2015 when it didn't matter and voted no when it does.  Voters will remember!

UPDATE: Skinny is no longer just about mandate. Door now open for waivers that hurt ppl w pre-existing conditions. (Called "1332 waivers.")
Unless everyone is covered under healthcare including pre-existing conditions, your vote should be NO.  #SinglePayerNow

So we are counting on you to stand with humanity & not your party?
Counting down the days until we can get you out of the Senate you fraud
Please listen to Gov Kasich, vote no on this embarrassing plan
Kasich among governors who opposed skinny repeal" plan threatens coverage 4 millions of hardworking Americans http://read.bi/2vaVLKe  #ohpol
This administration is not loyal.  You owe your loyalty to the people of Ohio.
Political retribution to a state for a vote of conscience by a representative of the people will be status-quo in mafia-like Trump era. https://twitter.com/adndotcom/status/890431919652880385 …
You DARE mention healthcare after voting to advance senate bill? You're afraid of the looneys who support Donald. Your heart knows better.
vote NO today. Save lives Save the ACA and improve on it.

2. If bill DOES get to conference, it will be merged w House bill making DEEP cuts to Medicaid, which your Sen prob *said* they opposed. 11/
if u care about healthcare,u will vote against the Senate healthcare bill. There is no middle ground. There is no compromise.
Your constituents' lives are depending on you. Vote NO on #SkinnyRepeal. We're begging on our knees. We're at your mercy. Be careful.
End the mandate!
Will Portman agree to harm, even kill, thousands of poor Ohioans just to give Trump a "win." WILL CRUEL, nasty TRUMPCARE BE PORTMAN LEGACY?
If you mean anything that you say then you must vote no on today's repeal bill
When's the #Buckeye coffee in OHIO vs DC?
As a reminder, you were elected to serve and listen to all of your constituents. Answer your phones. Hold a town hall. You serve us.
#skinnybill will only destabilize market more and raise premiums for #Ohio. Vote No
How do I get invited to one of these?
Who gets to go to these and how much does it cost? Why can't actual Buckeye visit your Columbus office? No skinny repeal!#SaveOurHealthcare
Hold firm on healthcare and only support things that will actually help the people of Ohio.
Please vote NO on the skinny repeal.
YOU ARE A CON ARTIST JUST LIKE YOUR CRIME BOSS IN THE WH.
Speaking of #healthcare... Protect Ohioans' Healthcare! Do not continue worrying about what your party thinks. You represent OHIO not reps.
Who cares about the two hundred year human trafficking. Instead, get some ideas to fix healthcare like a large pool of single people.
@senrobportman - please see below. Fix the leg, don't shoot
https://twitter.com/TinaPirlot/status/890578531759140866 …
Vote No on #SkinnyRepeal and work to repair ACA. The majority of Ohioans are asking you to stand up for them.
Calling all my relatives in Ohio to vote your ass out.
You want to do good? Vote no on skinny repeal & work w/Dems to create real solutions to ACA problems. Don't vote to strip care from 16M.
Meet your constituents in Ohio.  Asking us to travel to D.C. is shameful.  Hold a town hall Senator.
How much do I have to pay to get into one of these? Is a trip to DC included in the price of your vote?
Why won't you keep your word senator? How is being two-faced going to get you reelected? We the People expect representation god dammit!
Who did you talk to? Not your constituents in Ohio? Come ole spineless Rob, have a town hall meeting with everyone! Not just your donors!
Couldn't come up with a plan in seven years, but now can write a health bill over lunch. That's careful legislating
Source has told colleague @yabutaleb7 that Rs will *write* skinny bill @ today's policy lunch. Unclear if wish list meets reconciliation.
Totally disappointed in Portman's NO vote to Repeal Obamacare. Wee need someone to make a change and if you can't get out
bot
Senator Portman its your job to know whats in the so called skinny bill instead of smirking in the camera how about u go find out we pay u
so shameful to see Comrade Trump disgrace the service of so many honorable vets who have the courage to serve unlike him
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare #BCRA #AHCA #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
POINT 7: CBO lays blame for the insurer exit largely with Trump.   In fact... 12 
Great! Also stand up for women & trans facing challenges in other sectors #Murkowski #transmilitaryban #humanrights #judgenot 
Please give more specific details to your healthcare plan. I don't mind supporting something that makes sense.
How do I get invited to a Buckeye Coffee?
One more time for the back: "Buckeye Coffee" is not a town hall. Ohio deserves truth in representation.
PLEASE don't cave to KOCH's and PAC's.  Our lives and health our important. Need a better fix, NOT 1% giveaways.
No amount of lipstick is going to dress up these piggy plans so far.  VOTE NO and STAND WITH US for something better!
200 billion is an inadequate kick in and NO JUSTIFICATION FOR GUTTING MEDICAID.  VOTE NO on skinny repeal plans!
Remember that that the #ACA will cover the recovery of victims of #HumanTrafficking- addiction, mental health, STD treatment.
So, please vote NO to #ACARepeal and NO to #SkinnyRepeal, if you care about #HumanTrafficking victims & vulnerable Ohioans.

I'm glad you had time for this before you vote to take away our healthcare. Unless you surprise us all and vote how we want you to.

6- What could you possibly negotiate @robportman that would be worth making health care much more expensive for everyone? 
Vote No on the skinny repeal!  Premiums will increase and many will lose coverage!!  Just say No.
So you talked about the latest disastrous CBO estimate to Skinny repealand the need for a bipartisan approach right?
Join the Dems
Vote no on 'skinny repeal' which will increase number of uninsured and raise premiums for middle-income Americans.
Human trafficking is caused by unConstitutional Federal laws.  REPEAL, DON'T REPLACE!!!!
funny, none of your staffers want to talk about healthcare when I call.
You get a human answer? I only get voicemail, tried for months
sometimes their state offices answer if you dial like a dozen times in a row. I haven't talked to any D.C. staffers in months either
I've been calling the Columbus office for days-it either rings & rings & rings, or I get a "the number you've dialed is too busy" message
Have left messages for D.C. Office.
Nice that you had this meeting. When is your next open town hall? Your constituents have some questions for you.
Basically, majority of the GOP are afraid of their constituents. Heaven forbid they listen to us & our needs. We don't give them enough $$$
You lied to get elected. Portman is a liberal progressive dressed up as a Republican
How much does one have to donate to participate in Buckeye Coffee?
A trip to D.C.
Not in Ohio?
Good question, I had assumed. Now I'm dying to know. I had thought he was only doing corporate "town halls" (quotes intended) in OH.
U have to go to DC for the coffee & then he meets w/ "business owners" privately afterwards. Constituents who go on their own, not so much
That's what I thought. Maybe I should have hubs extend an invite for a plant tour .  "Oh look, I just happened to be here today!"
Still so wrong that one has to have some sort of incentive for him to meet: money or photo op.
By "discuss" I'm sure he means state obamacare isn't working for Ohioans and we need something better (something that makes him richer)
@jsmhollander @senrobportman Portman is a liar. I live there. Ohio is a Medicaid expansion state. Prems 3%-5% nothing crazy.
I've been calling, tweeting, & writing to @senrobportman every day for months. He refuses to address, or even acknowledge, his constituents.
Yeah, he's basically worthless. His staffers never even answer the phone. I always get voicemail
I reached a staffer once and he laughed when I said I was calling in support of ACA. @senrobportman & his staff are completely worthless.
If you dont care about everyone having healthcare I don't know why I should care about people being trafficked.
@Senate @Congress @Ohio @SenPortman Stand Up! Keep & Fix ACA / ObamaCare & Save Medicaid, Medicaid Expanded & Social Security & Medicare
I hope everyone there called you out for being the Baby Killer that you are!!
YOU DONT DISCUSS HEALTHCARE WITH ANYONE WHAT IS THIS
