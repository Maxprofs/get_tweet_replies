Business will not be happy with an actual cst/benefit analy:   accounting for the social costs of gasoline raises the price to $6.27.
Are you looking to lighten the burden on health insurance companies who voluntarily choose to leave exchanges and pay millions in bonuses?
Sabotaging it now;Diverting funds for ACA towards a social campaign against the law&letting states impose arduous rules for ppl on Medicaid.
Listen to the experts in Ohio re Senate health bill. PCMH are reducing costs while improving outcomes. Vote NO for OHIO and America.
We need the protections for our health, safety, and environment. Including with our health insurance. #VoteNoBCRA
Your statement doesn’t specify which regulations are so burdensome. Please elaborate.
When have conservative ideas EVER worked?? All the areas with strong economies in the country are BLUE!! God help us who live in red states.
Wow, Really? Have you been to Chicago, Detroit, Philly? You need to get out more.
Minneapolis/St.Paul is booming.
Regulations are protections for Americans.
Still haven't seen you state any specific regulations that are a burden rob.  Give us some details vs the normal generic bs
Regulations protect the common good and level the playing field. Businesses need to Stop whining.
Wrong! We need regulations on business in order to protect workers and consumers. Do not support this bill that benefits plutocrats.
Will you say yes to the #mysterybill? https://twitter.com/aarpadvocates/status/889609299122585601 … #wealthcare
Accordingly, we will report to all 38 million AARP members how their Senators vote, via ads, our print publications, social media and more.
Giving big business the right to screw the American people isn't doing your job. You represent US not the Republican agenda. Get it right.
#raa is NOT good for people. People are your constituents. Vote NO on RAA and vote NO on #Trumpcare
Regs don't kill jobs. Customers create jobs and economic growth. Higher wages create customers. #Unions create higher wages.


I don't doubt that part BUT you people are acting like you can't walk & chew bubblegum! You have had 7 years on this! We are tired of BS!!!!
NO NO NO
You write those laws, why the hell didn't you fix them before they became critical? Too busy working against .@realDonaldTrump's campaign!
And which regulations would you be referring to?  We should talk.  At a town hall perhaps.
#NoRAA #NoTrumpCare. How can you live with yourself when you are willing to sell out the people?
Maybe when you're done obsessing over the health of businesses you'll have time to give a f%ck about the health of human beings.
do u believe your own bill? "protect the health and welfare of all Americans, and contribute to the prosperity and quality of life"#SaveACA
Not one regulation mentioned by name  but speaking of regulations why not work on helping the least of your brothers
This is the price of lax regulations, Senator: http://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/welcome-to-beautiful-parkersburg/ … Is this the future you want for all of us?
We are all accountable- socialize risk and privatize profit is NOT The American way!
Why won't you tell us which regulations you're after and why? You're acting like an ideologue - not a Senator.
Crook.
You are putting corporations and special interests over people when you keep cutting regulations. It's not hard to see who is in your pocket
Who is going to protect people from loosing their healthcare?
What regulations do you feel need to be taken away that will allow companies to pay their workers more and also ensure safe environment?
"experts, told us that ...the evidence so far is that the overall effect on jobs is minimal. "  https://www.propublica.org/blog/item/whats-the-evidence-that-regulations-kill-jobs …
Finally something I support. I think your coming in the right direction.
Sounds like businesses are your priority -  why is that?
The #RAA has failed every other time it has been introduced. Maybe it's time for you to come up with some new ideas!

6- What could you possibly negotiate @robportman that would be worth making health care much more expensive for everyone? 
The burden is not on the biz, it's on the worker when you take regulations away. Start working for the middle class, not the rich.
We don't need an act with a lot of pork thrown in. Just eliminate bad regulations, go to work don't rule us to death.
Do you follow history, Rob? Remember the pollution of the early 1970s? That was unregulated business. Housing crisis of 2008? Same thing.
Going further back, business did real well using child labor in dangerous jobs. That was America in the 19th century or Bangladesh today.
How many of our protections do you want to strip away, Rob? Do you want to make America like Bangladesh? Not good for most working Americans
And all this pain and poverty so you can drink water in a plastic bottle and then send that plastic to a landfill. Think of the future, Rob.
Please protect equal access to health insurance for all. S biz owners should not have to work at a factory to get fair rates & services
I like my air clean, my food safe and my water non-toxic. citizen needs>industry needs. We've been sold out enough to corporate interests.
Yeah because it's not like anyone ever died or anything #cancerclusters #toxicwaste #unfundedpensions #justtrustcorporate
It's critical you do not vote yes for the BHCA because of the health burden many Americans are facing
Vote no on the terrible healthcare bill. Stand up for the people!

Come tour my mill in Lorain. Had 2500 jobs now down to 200. I'd like to discuss your ideas for helping my co screw me and my family.
When will you do a town hall meeting in  OH to answer questions about the #RepealAndRun bill & Trumpcare?
You are anti-regulations because your @GOP overlords tell you to be protect the #workers and the #environment or #resign
When will companies be held accountable for letting their equipment become so outdated they can't compete? Always take $ & run. F the worker
Say it with us "regular workers", Regulations =PROTECTIONS!! CEOs are still rich, stop lying! @All100Senators

CALL @senrobportman. There is zero room to debate on #RepealAndRun & taking health care from 32M Americans. #ProtectOurCare. 844-432-0883 
As a small business owner in Columbus Ohio I call BULLSHIT!
Deregulation only helps corporate thieves. Protect the public NOT ur pocketbook
The heavy burdens my company carries are paying millions to ceo while losing $$$. No sign of investing in process to be more competitive.
Keep yapping and taking and showing your true self you will not be reelected
I live in Florida where Gov Scott did not fall for expanded #Medicaid unlike Gov Kasich. Now you want the rest of us to bail out Ohio. 
And the uninsured rate in florida is > twice that of Ohio. Seems like a poor choice by your governor.
It's almost as if you don't read your replies because you don't care what you constituents think.

EIGHT YEARS AGO TODAY — Obama does 2-hour health care town hall in Ohio, takes questions and defends his plan. 

It's time to decide whether you're going to be a priest of the Empire or a prophet of God. https://youtu.be/xTtRk8np7S4 

Deductibles for a low-income person could shoot up to $13,000 under the Senate bill scored by the CBO, per Axios. https://www.axios.com/the-13-000-deductible-2462818458.html?utm_medium=linkshare&utm_campaign=organic …
Regulations protect us all.  Not just a select few
Still no town hall.  And is willing to work towards a yes on throwing 32 million off of healthcare and giving a tax cut to the rich.
Yes because worker & environmental safety aren't important. 
looking out for your rich friends as always
No on healthcare bill. Any regulation or law can be burdensome if it prohibits what u want to do. Laws and regs are necessary or anarchy.
