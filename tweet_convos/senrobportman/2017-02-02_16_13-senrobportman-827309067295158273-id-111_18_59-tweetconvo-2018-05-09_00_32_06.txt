how about a post on #devos or, don't you want all those NO vote requests made public?! Listen to your constituents
he already said he supported her. He's an ass!
yes, but he's refusing to admit his constituents want #noDevos!  His office says they have never tracked calls?!
Too bad because I have called about many things. My voice as an Ohioan must not matter.
are you joking??? Your constituents are demanding responses! Why are you voting against our wishes? #NoDevos #NoSessions
If you start a GoFundMe, you may be able to raise enough to outbid DeVos for his vote.
that's so sad! Bigly sad. But you're probably right
$ 51.000 Besty DeVos donated to your campaign $ 51.000 to sell out Ohio School Children
Yep. Our Ohio kids cost @BetsyDeVos a mere $.30 each. #CORRUPTION
No shame at all
yeah! Additionally, we need to impose a new Senator in the midterm elections 2018. Approving Devos is unacceptable.
I imagine it's difficult to vote against her after she contributes $51K to your campaign
W/O P5+1 sanctions would be worse than useless
how will you be voting on #DeVos?
he's voting yes. He's a coward. She paid him 50k last election. Money talks. Portman will be voted out.
A shame. We have 1 in school and 2 headed there in the fall, might as well look at homeschool #StopDeVos
I'm with you on that. My daughter starts kindergarten next year too.
The oldest will be in 6th (gulp) and has special needs. We're really in for it. Thanks #DeVos
Can't wait to vote against you when you come up for reelection. I know it'll be awhile. I can wait.
Somebody take away Robs rubber stamp. He is no longer responsible enough o use it. See ya at mid-terms Robbie!
more than 100k visas revoked! This is outrageous-these are valid visas. Also people are dying in the Ukraine. Trump is unfit!
I won't be surprised if #Putin is funding #Iran. He does so whisper in everyone's ears!
how about you stand up to @realDonaldTrump and say no to @BetsyDeVos?
Is a $51K donation to your campaign more important to you than Ohio kids' education? #DumpDevos
why support DeVoss when your constituents have said that's not what we want? Please talk to us, dont use "statements"!
Your constituents want a no vote. Your money wants a yes vote. I wonder which is more important? #NoonDeVos #devosboughtyou
Devos owes Ohio $5mil, but you take $51K from her for your campaign and support her for Sec Ed? Sad. #DumpDevos
why isn't your #DeVos statement posted on twitter of Facebook?
encourages sanctions on Iran; take heed Iran, he's getting ready to vote Devos in for just a $51k donate
vote no on Betsy DeVos. She's bad for our children!
$51,000 from De Vos on last campaign. Hmm how will you vote?
are you kidding me with the DeVos vote?  Mothers in the state voiced their opinions and you ignored us.
great but let's not deflect - constituents are screaming to vote no on #DeVos
cannot believe you're voting for DeVos. Quit playing party politics. She is NOT qualified. Is money that important to you?
sanctions on Russia quit jumping on Bannons band wagon #STOPPRESIDENTBANNON
#sellout
still won't listen to your constituents...we are watching
Seriously, if you REALLY believe in #MAGA, you should really be making a statement about anti-#DeVos. Protect our children!
please help the senate find someone more qualified than@betsydevos  for education secretary.  #VoteNoDevos
lets talk #Russia senator, & #Putin. Us people have made the connections. We hope you are not in their pockets.
your career is over! #DumpPortman
And on Betsy deVose who public educators in Ohio distrust.

More voters want to repeal Trump than the ACA https://twitter.com/ppppolls/status/827191722153230338 …
What's the point of foreign policy if we can't even protect domestic ruin? What are we ACTUALLY protecting? #DumpDevos
Are you also supporting Trump's lies about Iran?
http://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/the-trump-administrations-lies-about-iran/ …
Yes, sanctions are definitely what @realDonaldTrump was thinking of. Not military action. No, not at all.
what happened to Russia?  You are okay with loosening those today. #sellout
THIS is your response to a constituent re: Steve Bannon? #spineless #wrongsideofhistory #coward #unchristian
vote NO on Betsy DeVos #DoYourJob
You are not listening to your constituents. No one wanted this

DEVOS
You are completely clueless! Wake up Ohio! @OHDems @OhioSenateDems @OHHouseDems
We must block Betsy DeVos.
I will not be voting for you again if you confirm DeVoss.  You are not doing what WE OHIOANS have asked you to do!  Shame!
I'm a Cincinnatian and attended HPCUMC. I ask you to listen to your conscience, and vote no on DeVos.
It's not too late to make us proud.
tell your constituents why you are voting yes for de Vos. I know you hate talking to us. Do a town hall in Columbus, not DC
Not seeing much support from your constituents for DeVos. You work for OH...not other Republicans, not DeVos, not Trump-OHIO!
please vote no on DeVos. Please do as your constituents are asking you to do. Who do you serve?
What about Russia?!?!
are you REALLY selling out our children to DeVos for 51K when she owes OHIO 5 million?
vote NO on DeVos
You want Devos who fled Ohio,leaving millions in unpaid fines for illegal fundraising, that benefited you? Ohio won't forget.
vote NO on DeVos! Also your phones are busy. Are they off the hook?
what happened to our moral authority?  Sexually assaulted and targeted by #POTUS ?
how can we be tough on Iran's leadership when our #POTUS has violated our own constitution's values?
why don't you have a town hall meeting to listen to your constituents opinions on this and also VOTE NO ON DEVOS
My special needs child deserves better than Betsy DeVos. Pls don't be a sold man.
you're a coward
There is no justification for this action. Our enemies are not in Iran.
dude, are you going to let our President start an unnecessary war(s)? 

You're done representing Ohio.
vote no on DeVos! I'm more qualified, I actually know growth/proficiency difference don't shame OHIO
I'm a substitute teacher and parent which makes me more qualified, too. VOTE NO
Meanwhile, the quality of public education in OH is at risk from an unqualified Sec. of Education appointee.
A Yes vote for DeVos means you can never again speak about a teacher's preparation and qualifications for the job.
very disappointed on your agreement to accept DeVos. You're not listening to your constituents.
Yes and pritect kids in your state. NO on DeVos.
.@senrobportman No on DeVos!!! She is unqualified and bought her way to the nomination.
what about Russia? Or is that all part of the trump, Tillerson, @GOP pay for play.
how about stepping up and voting NO to DeVos- great place to start.
your (conservative) constituents are overwhelmingly saying NO DeVoss - will you heed what they are asking? Please reply!
wondering if you are listening to your constituents urge you to vote NO on #DeVos
Wasn't it #russian sanctions yesterday? Oh wait, we dropped those today! Onto a new country - keep an eye on #australia
and RUSSIA!!! Russia makes Ukraine to Hell! Russian invaders more than 5,000 shells let the last 5 days
Get your head out of the sand and listen to the people of Ohio #noDevos
What about Russia? Or do they have #kompromat on you too?
and we must stand up for our children's future. Come ON, Man. NO on DeVos!!!!! And you KNOW it's the right thing to do.
Senator, your constituents are making it VERY clear we expect a "no" vote on Betsy Duvos.
Thanks for showing your complete indifference to public education by endorsing plagiarist billionaire Betsy DeVos.
no no no on DeVos
how about Russia?
Iran sanctions won't distract us from what Russia is doing. Focus on that and vote NO on DeVos.

-Akron
How much are you being paid to insert "Iran" for "Russia"?
think you misspelled "Russia" there, as in "on #Russia when necessary."
How about those Russia sanctions?  Do you love party more than country?
We're going 2 sanctions on you at the Ballot Box!Answer us!Answer your Phone give us Answer on how your going 2 VOTE NO DeVos
surely "if necessary" you imply inevitability the kind of mistakes our Ohio kids might make with DeVoss as EdSec
.@senrobportman While you wimp out and put the future of public education in the hands of a completely unqualified Drumpf sycophant.
He's not up for election midterm. He's voting for DeVos. He is tweeting about Iran sanctions instead of Russian sanctions.
I agree 100%.  And you need to stop public criticism of @POTUS as it becomes fuel to leftist fire...sound bites.
#noDevos
imposing new sanctions is unnecessary escalation. As an Ohioan and an American I do not support this
Vote no on Devos. And answer your damn phone.
you are just a Trump puppet and an embarrassment to Ohio.  You don't care what your constituents want or youwould prove it
what about upholding the Russian sanctions? Vote no on Devos.
#sellout #portman
.@senrobportman we should not provoke a war just to satisfy Trump's ego.
GOP wants war could care less about Russia hacking
and you must also vote NO on DeVos.
-A constituent from Columbus, Ohio
too late. He will vote yea
what about Russia?  Shouldn't the same hold true for the evil empire?
what myself would say doesn't need be said online 1st
Yes and Vote no on DeVos
I believe he's voted yes on devos so between that & this message he's given up his principles 4 trump interests
