We know #opioidcrisis is one of your pet causes.  You might want to read this before repealing the #ACA.  #Ohio
If u live in Ohio like I do, u'd know that the #ACA created the #opioidcrisis by giving repeated easy access to abuse & sell opioids.
How would access to #opiods be more difficult wihout ACA?  Only way I could think is that fewer would be insured.  Not a good solution, imho
Very cheap co-payments thru medicaid & the 145% expansion keeps the pills following to poor/mid class who renew their scripts, use or sell.
If that's the case, how do you propose on fixing it w/ a better healthcare bill?  I think we'd all like that, regardless of who proposes it.
Separate the individual market & do something else for Medicaid & pre-exist. sm biz owner, lost our group coverage. My deduct now 15x more.
As for #smallbiz, I empathize w/ the burdens of smallbiz owners providing benefits to employees.  We need to make it easy for them to do so.
So how can we best do that?One benefit in #ACA is it's theoretically easier for individ's to get own insurance when not provided by employer

Y'all need to start buying your own insurance. Things will get figured out much faster then.
According to Trump insurance only costs $12 a year so should be easy
Senator, please keep your promise to voters & vote to repeal Obamacare which has resulted in loss of jobs & skyrocketing premiums; I beg U.
#KeepThePromise #FullRepeal #NoReplacement #UnitedForFreedom
Health care is none of your business. Government attempts to control it are illegitimate and unconstitutional. #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom
GOP...let this guy raise his money from the dems he has decided to join.  Get him out!  He lied to his base.  https://mobile.twitter.com/ForAmerica/status/887778066184929280/video/1 …
Be sure to bring this up!
BREAKING! 60% want to keep #Obamacare and make it better (33% prefer to throw out & start over) @FoxNews #Poll  http://fxn.ws/2uJTLrS  
That's BS people do not want 2 keep failing worthless baboon care fraud! Ur in fantasy Island!
Your constituents are afraid of not having affordable healthcare. We have other insurances that are reasonably priced. Why not healthcare?
#FullRepeal #NoReplacement #FreeMarket #defundpp #UnitedForFreedom

That will never happen.  He has no spine and an unwillingness to break from party. I'm in his district
Many constituents dontbwatch Fox!  Try another network!
Obamacare should be fully repealed and control of health insurance returned to the state of Ohio and the people.
Did you explain that you'll believe any fake numbers the administration throws at you? Your constituents will pay for your willful ignorance
#WorkTogether #NoRepealNoReplace
Awwww Fox News. Keep Sticking with your GOP talking points. You will be held accountable Trump will be impeached.
Stand Up 4 Ohioans w/Pre-existing Conditions! We need Affordable Healthcare the most! Vote NO on this bill! Work 4 a bipartisan solution!
Fraud.
Vote *NO*, you work for us in Dayton, we say no!
Your hearing only bad healthcare stories is getting old. Your blinders are really showing. You are living a lie. FIX THE ACA!
Do not support the GOP deathcare plan. I'll be calling your office again tomorrow. Talk soon?
who could ever believe you about healthcare after breaking your promise to repeal #RINO #RepealObamacare
Sir, will you keep your promise and repeal Obamacare ? My family and friends along with myself have given you our votes for this reason.




Get off your ass! Honor damn oath to defend the Constitution! How dare you support treasonous @POTUS! Who the hell do you think you are?
Yeah what shit you selling!!!!
So you will go on fox news and discuss healthcare but you won't hold a town hall with your constituents?You are a coward!
your not appearing on a"news" channel, you are appearing on a propaganda channel. Fox = fake news.
Congrats on betraying your voters and buckling to Soros funded fake polls.. You need to resign now.  Let a Democrat do your job.
Very unhappy about report of my senator holding out against repealing Obamacare, an unfair law he previously criticized.  So frustrated!
Fox News, huh? I guess we won't be having a real town hall anytime soon if you are still searching for #GOP safe spaces. #leadership
Trump promised lower premiums, lower deductibles, and better coverage. We saw how that went. How can you lower taxes without cutting...
...services or increasing the deficit? It seems too many Republicans can't do simple math. Make the 1% pay their fair share

Not a good moment. Vague platitudes. Opose the bill. Work with Dems to improve ACA. Put the nation above party. Show courage and integrity
Dude Fox News is bullsh*t Ohio deserves better than hot nonsense
I just missed this. Did you figure out how to lower cost and protect the most vulnerable, maybe work together with Dems?  #waiting
Why don't you try another news outlet that isn't right wing propaganda?
Fox? Therein lies the problem.
You look like a deer in the headlights 
I heard your comments on Cavuto's show...Glad you are my Senator...I'm confident you will get a good health care bill done soon...
Full Repeal GOP needs to get rid of BOcare NOW.
19 counties have lost most ins options; down to 1 provider choice. That 1 choice could be eliminated. Then what will those people do??
You used to be so cool.
You mean state run, entertainment/propaganda faux news outlet?

BREAKING: In rare joint letter, insurers say Cruz amendment "unworkable in any form" and will lead to "widespread terminations of coverage." 
You need repeal first to get leverage for replace. Then best solution is federal coverage of catastrophic needs while leaving the rest to us
Would result in tens of thousands of deaths, drastic increase in bankruptcies.
We live in a society, should provide affordable health care.
So you're on State TV?
How will repealing taxes that fund the ACA make it better for the majority of Ohioans? Wrong priority Senator. #SaveMedicaid #IStandWithPP
Afraid to go on a real news network, Rob? If I was you, I would run for the cover of my propaganda outlet, too.
They won't ask any tough questions like do you support healthcare for working Americans.
Fox will let you talk tax relief and not ask why 98% of Americans won't benefit from your plan. Easy peezy, Rob. No real statements here.
I'm sure the foxes guarding the hen house will help you explain to Ohioans. Vote NO on repeal without replace. Vote NO on #trumpcare No. 3
Unfortunately, you still don't understand the need for a bipartisan solution. You talked about coming together, but only as partisans.
Wow. I just went out of my way to watch you say nothing of substance. Maybe if you fix the ACA instead of killing it you could get a spine.
Hello friend! Hey, I know miss Sarah!
"That's right, Neil. As I said, the extremely popular expansion of medicare in Ohio isn't working and we should take it away."
About how you couldn't decide either way? Coward.

Veterans are speaking out against the Senate #Trumpcare bill which might hurt 1.75 million #veterans and their families #ProtectOurCare 
Explain again why you voted for Betsy Devos.  It cracks me up every time.
.
Fox News??? ewwwww
Vote "no" on BCRA's MTP.
I hope you're announcing your no vote. Or retirement.

Health care bill would  premiums & take coverage from thousands of West Virginians. RT to tell @SenCapito: #VoteNo 
Like passing it without any bipartisan effort? #FullRepeal
How a politician lies to his base & helps destabilize healthcare:

THE WORLD IS WATCHING! YOU ARE FAILING YOUR CONSTITUENTS, @senrobportman !

@NOFAindivisible , @maddow…
