Come to Ohio and address your constituents during the Feb 20 recess #PortmanTownHall
but you didn't question Secretary of education as to her experience, qualifications, or knowledge  to lead the department
just lost so many conservative votes. Why did you not do what your Ohio constituents have overwhelmingly asked you to do?!
question ban on on nsc. Or did he give you $51k too like Devos
You've made it clear you value $ and being Trump's lapdog more than your constituents. Shame.
You are a disgrace. Suddenly your phone lines are open? Sorry I didn't have $51,000 to buy your vote. #BetsyDeVos
Ask your bff Betsy for our $5M.  Hell, take it out of her first paycheck! @empowerohio @TheOHrevolution @SocialPowerOne1
You voted against our children, please don't vote against our country, too.
. Do not confirm Sessions.

#BetsyDevos-our new Ed Sec has a $5.3M fine SHE STILL OWES-for breaking election laws in OH

#dworkinreport #resist #devos #stopdevos #trump 
question Sessions on his ability to be apolitical.  No Sessions
AND I question your integrity after being bought for $51,000.00.
did you check with Steve Bannon first?
You are a joke, Rob. Bet your family is so proud of you!

Signed & sharing!
Thank you !!! Keep resisting
will you stand against Russia or love the communists like trump and #gop. Party before US people #draintheswamp
#ImpeachPotus45 I have had it with you and your #SoCalledPresident - now we work on impeachment
Shame on you for voting for DeVos. You're better than that. Disgraceful.
can't wait till you go back to being called Mr. Portman
Too bad you didn't pay attention to testimony of DeVos! Will resist your reelection!
Please tell me you're smarter than that. Russia?
But, you voted yes for Betsy DeVos. Couldn't care less what you did in committee. @senrobportman has lost all credibility.
Drink some more koolaid, Rob.
Today, I questioned the value of having you as our senator.  #DumpPortman2022
have you questioned your party yet? Or are you still putting the party over your own constituents? #NoOnSessions
. Dear Senator, plz question the logic of Bannon on the NSC. Congress  be strong vs. Trump when he ignores the Constitution.
sell out
then asked for a donation and voted which ever way they asked. #devosboughtportmansvote

You voted for DeVos, and that won't be forgotten.  #indivisibledyt
you failed us today Senator.
is this supposed to make us trust you again? #StopSessions #constituentsmatter #startyourjobsearch #starbuckishiring
Who will be paying for this vote?
No reason to act like a few questions was something great when you already lost your spine with your DeVos vote
you lost me with Devoss
well your president says we're no better than Putin so...
You can really detect the glee in your voice from when you cashed Betsy DeVos’s check earlier today.
did you ask them if they thought Bannon on the security council was wise? I've left you messages about this. Please respond
that's nice, too bad no one will know what that means in 20 years because you voted to confirm DeVos.
Your words are hollow but your actions are not. Party before people! #NoonDeVos
$51,000
I wish you believed experts were necessary in education as well.
What about Russia's plan to subvert our elections?
ya great but what about the #devos vote? Thanks for the let down.
OMG I tweeted you this yesterday and you mouthed the admin position on Eastern Border of Ukraine
@senrobportman Just in case the Sen Intel Ctte is as confused as Trump Admin on where fighting in Ukraine is taking place https://twitter.com/uacrisis/status/828551295116124161 …
Russia has money too. They going to buy your vote to? Shame for your cowardly DeVos vote.
51k for vote
but you will vote the party line. Are you more afraid of djt that Ohio voters? Maybe we should start a recall petition.
and then u voted for betsy devos, so i wouldn't say you accomplished anything good today
Who ever pays you to go there way
you will not get re-elected

#PortmanTownHall for February 20th recess. Let's make it happen, people. Keep his phones ringing!
I question you on ignoring your constituents' concerns regarding education. #thedayeducationdied #RIPpublicschools
Do you, Senator, consider #PresidentBannon a national security expert?
#TheEnemyIsInTheCockpit
dude: who cares: you are soon to be persona non grata here in OH.
sellout
you took a bribe from DeVos.
