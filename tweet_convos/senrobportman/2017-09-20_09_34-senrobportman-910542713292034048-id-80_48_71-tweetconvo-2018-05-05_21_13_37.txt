They also deserve good healthcare.
thank you for protecting vulnerable women. Will you extend that kindness to vulnerable patients with pre-existing conditions?
No 1 answers phones, VMs cut off at 10sec, constituents can't enter Cinci office. U R not even pretending to work for us. U work for Kochs.
No on Graham Cassidy. Bad for Ohio. Stand up and defend our state Rob or face our wrath. All the donors in the world won't matter.
Trafficking victims deserve affordable health care too.
While human trafficking is horrific, what about hearings on the Trumpcare bill? Americans with insurance fears deserve to be heard, too.
They need healthcare too but you don't understand that!
We want HEALTHCARE. #affordablecareact
Vote no on the Graham/Cassidy bill!!!
You should listen to heartbreaking stories from victims who did not have healthcare.
Speaking of heartbreaking, so is the healthcare bill. Vote NO! Your excuse that it gives more power to the states is BS!

You should hear the testimony of your constituents on healthcare at a #REALTownHallNOW.
NO #GrahamCassidy.
#DontRobOurCare
#whereyouatRob
You have done good work Senator you had bipartisan support! Please vote NO on the Graham repeal it is not bipartisan and OH will suffer!
& they deserve ways to prevent being vulnerable to trafficking again - having access to healthcare can do that! VOTE NO ON ACA REPEAL!
Concerned about human decency. Yet, backs Trump. Grap their p***ys. Right.
I can also personally attest that victims need access to Planned Parenthood for care. Please, vote No on Graham Cassidy. #protectourcare
Vote no on #GrahamCassidyMurderBill
Vote no on Graham-Cassidy. Don't inflict pain on your fellow Americans.
Victims like this primarily get health care from ACA .  Are you good w ripping it out from under them?   #VoteNo
Too bad she'll have a hard time getting healthcare.
Yes, victims deserve justice. You know what else they deserve and NEED? Access to affordable healthcare. #NOGrahamCassidy #FixACA
Victims of trafficking deserve health insurance.


Rob Even more heartbreaking is your failure to Repeal and replace the ACA
You know it's wrong but don't have the guts to stand up and say that.  It will be remembered how you vote.
This is important but you DO have a responsibility to speak out about The Cassidy bill. Don't take the spineless route again.
Victims need healthcare, physical and mental.  Keep the ACA to help these people you are fighting for.  Vote NO #GrahamCassidy.
Portman spells yes G O P.  So he'll vote for the death and harm of millions of Ohions.
I wish U cared as much bout millions of Americans with preexisting conditions that desperately need healthcare!
What's your statement on #GrahamCassidy ?  Please vote NO
His Senate seat was bought by the Koch Bros. He will again vote for his owners and against the interests of Ohioans.
Wonder no more. The Koch donor network will give GOP $400M for 2018 *only if ACA is repealed* & tax reform passes https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/26/koch-network-piggy-banks-closed-republicans-healthcare-tax-reform …
Then you should probably not vote for Graham-Cassidy because she would be able to get mental health care
How about voting no on this terrible health care bill.
Yet you support pussy-grabbing POTUS. Stay AWOL, Sen Portman.., Stay AWOL...
Stand up vote no!  Show you give a damn about Ohioans.
Find your spine and vote no on Graham-Cassidy....
 for her testimony! These victims do deserve justice and healthcare. #VoteNo on #GrahamCassidy
why no response to #GrahamCasiddy ? Your constituents are screaming vote NO.
I really believe you will vote for Graham Cassidy even though you know it will kill thousands of Ohioans because you don't have a spine
Vote no on Graham/Cassidy.
JUST IN: Blue Cross: GOP's ObamaCare repeal bill "undermines" protections for pre-existing conditions http://hill.cm/itZalcK  
They deserve justice and healthcare.  If you vote yes on #GrahamCassidyBill , how will they get the care they need?  #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
Sen, we all appreciate your work to combat sex trafficking.We'd also appreciate hearing your stance on #GrahamCassidy.Don't leave us hanging
Under your rule, they may get justice, but not the healthcare they need. Vote no, Portman.
They do, will you continue to give them access to affordable health care by voting no on Graham/Cassidy?
They also need healthcare...so does my 16 year old son, who battles T1D...he'll also be voting in 2 years
You might consider turning your phones on; I and other constituents have been calling urging you to talk about Graham-Cassidy; to vote no.
Of course. But they also need to be protected from losing access to healthcare. Don't pretend to care about them if you vote for GC.
That Rob is considering voting YES on #GrahamCassidy shows he 100% phony, a Senator for #KochGovt:
It's vile what the @GOP is putting Americans through again with this HC horror  We won't forget.
Hearing the President threaten to "destroy" another country yesterday was pretty heartbreaking... If you care about this country I guess.
Medicaid is the only assistance many sexual assault victims will have. Please don't do this.  Vote NO on the latest Trumpcare Bill.
Dying because your health insurance no longer covers pre-existing conditions would also be heartbreaking. No on #GrahamCassidy  !
Including Trump modeling agency? #PIMPOTUS #nullify45 #SaveACA
you know what's heartbreaking? Taking away healthcare from sick babies! #noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy
Speaking of testimony, don't help ram this garbage health care bill through without debate.
@JohnKasich spoke out against the #GrahamCassidyBill. I'm hoping you'll back him on this.  How is gutting #Medicaid help the people in Ohio?
Yes its heartbreaking It heartbreaking to let  children die with no healthcare too Something you have not one care about
Completely agree. And Ohioans need to keep their healthcare, so NO on Graham-Cassidy.
What's heartbreaking is your silence on #GrahamCassidy
Vote NO on Cassidy/Graham healthcare bill!  We won't forget how you voted!
It is heartbreaking and I hope this bill is passed. It would also be heartbreaking if you vote to strip insurance from millions of Americans

I'm Jake, I was born with a birth defect, without ACA and Medicaid I hit my life time cap when I was 14 days old! Without ACA I will die! 
What's your feelings on the #opioidcrisis in Ohio?  Are you going too protect the lives of Ohians, or are you just a yes vote?
Your staff is disrespecting this woman & her grief by hiding you behind #SESTA.  Where are you on #GrahamCassidy, stand up like a man.
Please vote #NOGRAHAMCASSIDY!Country Over Party
Vote "yes" on health care! Don't be a traitor again!
#MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
Stunning

Katy Tur: there are no protections for essential health care benefits in Graham-Cassidy…
