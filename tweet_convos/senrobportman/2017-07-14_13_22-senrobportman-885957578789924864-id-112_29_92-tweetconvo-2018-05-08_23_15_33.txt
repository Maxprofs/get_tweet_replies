Sir, you either approve the use of a hostile foreign govt intel service to win US elections or you don't. There's no middle ground or excuse
Pls do! And while you're at it, NO on Trumpcare and speak up abt collusion re Trump-Russia
I am joining my voice to the many calling for Jarred Kushner to have his security clearance pulled now.
Good thread on amended plan.
1. The Senate Trumpcare bill amendment was just released & it went from very bad to unworkably bad. First analysis.

Guess what covers their healthcare after they are rescued? I was a caseworker - FYI. They get full-coverage MEDICAID, and they NEED it!
We are calling on YOU to join the fight against the crappy "healthcare" bill. Make a public statement in opposition.
#NoCutsNoCaps
#NoBCRA

Don't do it, vote NO on healthcare bill or you can forget reelection!!!  Proud Ohioan!
Great. While you are there, can you ask them to review Jared Kushner's security clearance? Important for our nation's security.
Also why Loretta Lynch circumvented the laws/red tape and allowed Russian lawyer Natalia in the USA after she was originally denied access.
Plenty more where this came from.
#FalseBlame
What about the victims of @realDonaldTrump? Do you care about them?
VOTE NO on Health Care AND the ridiculous budget.

Vote no on this disastrous healthcare bill! Our lives depend on it

How will they get medical help if you repeal the ACA
Part 2 of the analysis of the plan.
Getting more analysis on Trumpcare revisions in Senate bill now.

Doing a press call & then will tweet what I've learned. 1
I'm calling on the #GOP and @senrobportman to reject #Trumpcare and revive #ethics within the party. Provide leadership, not #spin

Please be sure these victims will have access to healthcare. Vote No on the bill. 44050
Four tweets about this but you won't talk about health care or Russia. What kind of leadership is that?

Perhaps you should read this.
Fraud.
@POTUS through @TheJusticeDept has designated Cincinnati in National Public Safety Partnership to Combat Violent Crime hold hearing
While you've got them on the phone can you ask if they're going to do anything about revoking kushners security clearance

So the actuaries are opposed. The hospitals are opposed. The doctors are opposed. Now the insurers are opposed. Who is in favor? https://twitter.com/topherspiro/status/886015376173268992 …
This will save many people. Wouldn't you rather save 22 MILLION? Don't allow their healthcare to be stolen by your yes vote.
#TrumpNoCare
This is lovely, but we want you focused. When will you be announcing what your vote will be on #TrumpNoCare?
HEALTHCARE!  Your constituents are not going to fall for these tweets.  Where do you stand?
Please don't allow a vote without a CBO score and discussion.

Vote NO on Trumpcare!  Millions of Americans are counting on you to do the right thing!  Be a hero! Vote NO on Trumpcare!
And how will the victims get treatment? With the stripped down coverage your bill provides? I can do this all day buddy.
I'm calling on you to reject this terrible trumpcare bill that will reward the rich and kill Americans. Be a hero. History will know.
What's the solution
While you're at it I call on you @senrobportman to vote No on Senate Bill and fight for Ohioans and working class America
Did you catch Rachael Maddow's show tonight, #FlatRobPortman?
I can see that you support women's rights. Great!! Please repudiate the ongoing sexist position of our President, he is dangerous to women.
Pretty damn clear what your REPUBLICAN governor thinks of #Trumpcare. Will you show any courage by voting NO?
Gov. John Kasich’s statement on the Senate health care reform bill: 
You are a coward who doesn't care about your constituents. Who owns you?
Agreed! But don't vote for Trumpcare. Much More important!
Why hate on old people?
Just say NO to Trumpcare and to buyouts for your vote, Senator!
Republicans use state payoffs to win votes for repeal bill http://politi.co/2t0cYkM  
You mean like POTUS's Russian mobster friends?

BREAKING: In rare joint letter, insurers say Cruz amendment "unworkable in any form" and will lead to "widespread terminations of coverage." 
Are they not already empowered and directed to do that?  Vote NO on Trumpcare.
Sex trafficking is caused by unConstitutional Federal laws, dummy.
While you contemplate removing planned Parenthood, essential care for women. Vote no BCRA hurts Ohio

BREAKING: In rare joint letter, insurers say Cruz amendment "unworkable in any form" and will lead to "widespread terminations of coverage." 
I'm calling on you to vote NO on Trumpcare. Also, tell your constituents how you fell about #trumptreason. Your silence is complicity. SAD.
‘There is no plan B’ - this woman is battling stage 4 cancer and Trumpcare at the same time
I respect the sex and drugs stuff. But let's get rocking and rolling on saving Healthcare for Ohioans.
What about the millions affected by this White House?
Agreed also hope you vote no on this horrible healthcare bill which impacts so many people
Thanks for your work on this, Senator. - signed, an Ohioan w/ preexisting health conditions on a costly group insurance plan
Supposedly Ivanka is doing something on HT.  This isn't a party issue! What HAS to happen is to reduce demand
Rob:Dis is Betsy DeVos on dis akount & Mishigan law skool want us in da wahl of shame 4 worst peepole with Mishigan ties. Oh no a WUL4erine!
To be clear, sir: You'll valiantly help save trafficking victims but then deny them healthcare to deal with their physical/mental trauma? 
How about the horrific WEALTH care bill...and the fact that the administration is selling us out to the Russians with no consequences??? 
That's great Senator, agreed, sex trafficking is awful. Now about that healthcare bill...
So here's the thing no one can say anything about this horrific crime and the fact that you are speaking out against it. 1/
But if you go along w/this HC legislation than it just shows how inhuman you are. If you care about human life you can't pass the HC bill2/
You can't act like you care about human beings only when it comes to certain issues. If you care-than you truly care, and you'd say NO
@SenateGOP 
Citizens support our @POTUS and NEED-repeal Obamacare, restructure taxes, bld wall, DJT's budget, approve nominations!   #MAGA
You can always tell when @senrobportman  is feeling pressure from the people he is supposed to represent because he starts tweeting about
trafficking or opiate epidemic b/c we cant be mad abt him caring abt those things.  Pls care abt healthcare and treason as much!
I'm counting on you to vote "no" on health care to save countless lives!
You own @vp lies about #Ohio @JohnKasich 
No #TRumpcare

‘Going to be like the zombie apocalypse’: Trump voters tell CNN they’re terrified of Trumpcare http://www.rawstory.com/2017/07/going-to-be-like-the-zombie-apocalypse-trump-voters-tell-cnn-theyre-terrified-of-trumpcare/ … 

You must go public on #Healthcarebill and say NO!
Now that you're done reading and on to something else, I hope you can tell us your vote is NO!!
And we are calling on you to protect people with disabilities and vote NO! On this crappy health care bill! #ADAPTandRESIST
Can this battle be fought more effectively by the states?  The federal gov't seems totally absorbed by problems DJT keeps creating.
I am constituent and I have an idea,  why don't you call for  justice to be met in the collusion of our great countries elections.
Not sure Sessions will do that.  He's anti women, now he might fight for some white rich men if they've been victims of sex trafficking.
Build the wall to be part of fight on sex trafficking!
Vote no on the kill bill.
And I hope you're voting no on this medical bill.
Trumpcare 3.0 is a very bad idea!
Please, Sen Portman, vote no on Trumpcare. It will hurt the people of Ohio and help only the wealthiest among us.
Why are known security risks still occupying the WH? #TrumpRussia #JaredKushner #DonaldTrumpJr #donthecon
Severe Medicaid cuts, no pre-existing condition protection, Congress doesn't want it for itself. Vote No.
Please fight for the lives of Americans first. VOTE NO against the deadly Healthcare bill. Thousands of people will die of cancer every year
The right thing, so is voting no/protecting Ohioan's right to decent, affordable insurance that protects against pre-existing conditions.
Thank you. In the meantime, don't hand a pussy grabber a "victory" on healthcare!
For god sake, please tell the @ColumbusPolice to give that disabled woman her scooter back.
Perhaps we could start with getting the Russians out of the WH and the election process.
Great. Please look local: Ohio has serious problems. Those being trafficked need our help
Ohio is calling on you to protect millions of innocent patients from losing health insurance to tax breaks for millionaires. #leadership
Medicaid is going UP in Senate bill and House bill.
In the meantime vote NO
