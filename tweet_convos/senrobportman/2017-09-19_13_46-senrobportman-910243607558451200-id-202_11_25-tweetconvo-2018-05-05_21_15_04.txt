Your voters expect a yes vote on healthcare. Please, Sir, do not let us down. I remember your words on phone town meetings. You promised!
Still radio silence on #GrahamCassidy? Guess that means you're going to support it. Enjoy your last term in the senate.
Graham-Cassidy allows insurers to NOT cover:
-Pregnancy
-Newborn care
-Mental health services
-Prescription drugs
-Rehab
-Birth control
If you have constituents in mind you will VOTE NO on hc!  I don't comprehend how you just don't care.  Sup with that?
Sen. Heller is right.
The new Graham Cassidy healthcare bill is cruel to the middle class working families of America.
This new bill is even worse for lower middle class families than the other ones proposed over the summer.

I get why the irresponsible zealots vote for Trumpcare hooey but really why don't Sens. Alexander, Capito, Portman, Sasse do better? 1/6
Y aren't u speaking @ healthcare? Y r u ok with trump stealing rep election funds to finance his legal defense? The GOP is being fleeced.
#BREAKING: Study: New ObamaCare repeal would cost states $215 billion. http://hill.cm/Z3DpHp5  Vote NO on #GrahamCassidy

"this bill covers preexisting conditions"
*the bill doesnt, gives tons of ways to get out of it"
"this bill covers preexisting conditions"
PORTMAN/HC....these other distractions aren't working.  We want a town hall in Cinti before the healthcare vote. PERIOD
Just so you know, we are reading your tweets like, "La la la not about ACA la la la," and we are super angry at you.
I am so sick of him never answering the phones at any of his offices, holding a Townhall or looking after the needs of his constiuants.
Same! I was actually glad to be able leave a voicemail at the DC number. I did use Resistbot for him.
That's great.  I leave messages all the time. How do we know if he gets them.  He won't speak to us. He needs to go but he just got back in.
I say let's start using different extensions. Spread the word throughout the building or whatever.
Good idea.  I've been calling other Senators. Even if they are not mine, their decisions have an effect on all of us.
Yeah, I do that, too. And leave them messages they prob never see on FB and Twttr.
Portman's voicemail is full except for Washington and Columbus.  Going to his website to send e-mails.
You want us to protect companies and coddle them. But you're all, "I don't know,sick babies? maybe i'll let them die." #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
Rob for years the steel industry has been trying to get you republicans to stop the dumping of steel into this country WTF HAVE YOU DONE

There is NO national issue more important RIGHT NOW than protecting the HEALTHCARE of Ohioans.  PLEASE HAVE A CONSCIENCE and vote NO!
Ohio gets hit hard under tricky #GrahamCassidy. VOTE NO for Ohio.
New analysis finds Alaska is hit hard by #GrahamCassidy. So is Arizona. So is Ohio.

Vote No on Cassidy-Graham Bill.
9:11 am. DC office answers with recorded bullshit
9:06 am. Your Columbus office answers phone with recorded bullshit.
It's important that U.S. govt develop a health care plan that won't bankrupt a person for getting ill. Vote no!!!! We are watching.
Oppose Graham Cassidy!
Also Pittsburgh doesn't want Steel back. We have tech now. We need unions for start ups and strong retail jobs.

Graham-Cassidy health-care bill puts millions of Americans at risk http://wapo.st/2fySACt?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.500dcb5008e9 … helpful explanation of Cassidy-Graham awfulness
Rob, no teeets on new HC proposal. Where do you stand on this? It's not good for American citizens
Are you going to vote to kill babies Portman? God knows what you are doing to kill children, God knows.
It's important for you to vote NO on Cassidy-Graham #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
Why do we have to get on the phone and constantly remind you not to take away our healthcare. Are you losing your memory or just evil?
What is your position on Cassidy-Graham and why?
If indeed you betray Ohio by voting for Cassidy-Graham, at least have the courage to release tally of for and against messages you received.

Meanwhile ... Nothing about #GrahamCassidy  ?
Spineless! Will not even address healthcare!
-WILL support ANY @GOP bill.
-Will not speak to constituents!!
Say NO to PORTMAN!
Tell the truth: how many messages have you received in support of Cassidy-Graham? How many opposed?  Vote accordingly.

Under this bill, pregnancy will cost you an extra 17K. Metastatic cancer 172K. Autism 5K. Asthma 4K. This isn't a healthcare bill.
If you vote for Cassidy-Graham, it will be a betrayal of Ohioans that will define your legacy.
Why are you afraid to comment directly on Cassidy-Graham? If passed, it will be a stain on your party for decades.
It's also unfair that @SenateGOP is trying to take healthcare from millions of Americans. #VoteNoGrahamCassidy.

NEW: What AARP thinks of Graham Cassidy.

Not much. 
Cancer patients will face a nightmare scenario if Trumpcare becomes law. Bob will you vote to Kill Kids?
protect you constituents and don't vote for #GrahamCassidyBill
Is this what you want for constituents?
So instead of making college more affordable, the GOP vision is for your parents to burn a year's worth of tuition money on your birth. https://twitter.com/brianschatz/status/910156582784241666 …
Senators voting on sweeping legislation which won't even affect them personally
Stunning

Katy Tur: there are no protections for essential health care benefits in Graham-Cassidy…

#GrahamCassidyNO
Do the right thing #KillTheBill
How about a NO vote on repealing our healthcare!!!!

NEW: Graham-Cassidy ACA Repeal Bill Would Cause Huge Premium Increases for People with Pre-Existing Conditions https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/news/2017/09/18/439091/graham-cassidy-aca-repeal-bill-cause-huge-premium-increases-people-pre-existing-conditions/ …
Important for 25 million Americans not to lose the healthcare... but you don't give a damn.
#GrahamCasiddy doesn't pass the @jimmykimmel test. Hoping & praying @senrobportman cares more about healthcare vs scoring political points
Do NOT touch our healthcare or pass this horrific new bill. Ohioans are watching your every move.
No Graham Cassidy
It's important that YOU address a bipartisan fix to #ACA... it's UNFAIR to ohioans if u don't. 
Vote no  #GrahamCassidyBill #CassidyGraham
#VOTENOROB
Your silence on healthcare speaks volumes.
Ohio's biggest industry is healthcare. U vote yes. U dont care about people or economy in ohio.
Important that US gov't take on skyrocketing insurance prices in order to boost the health of America and provide Medicare for All.
Your tweets belong in an SNL skit.

#GrahamCassidy takes $2.5M away from Ohio, impacting more than #healthcare. Tell Sen. Portman to vote NO! https://cards.twitter.com/cards/18ce54ddo5i/4t7r9 …
It's important that the US govt responsibly give all Americans acces to healthcare
Talk to the leader of your party. You might start there.
Rob is more concerned about getting  from the Koch brothers so he can keep his job than the people of Ohio who need affordable health ins.
Since you don't take calls here I go.  NO to #GrahamCassidyDeathBill . MIllions will lose coverage and many will die. Including your opiate
Maybe you could take on healthcare by voting no on the #GrahamCassidy death bill. #Ohio #jobs (can't work if you're dying)
Leave my health care alone!!!


Republican party has sold soul to Kochs:
Vote FOR Planned Parenthood to save lives of women and babies.
Important that Rob Portman start standing up,for health care for Ohioans and Americans.  Vote NO on efforts to remove affordable care.
Don't vote for that GOP garbage "healthcare" bill.  Don't do it.
Important you not take away healthcare from millions of babies, elderly, disabled and veterans! #noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy
Preparing to sell out again, huh? We see you.
The G-C plan would take health insurance coverage from millions, eliminate critical public health funding, devastate the Medicaid program.
You all referred to ACA "death panels".... It wasn't Obamacare having them -- GOP is the Death Panel with this bill.  NO on G-C.
Also important that your constituents have #healthcare, Senator. Graham Cassidy is a death sentence and you know it. The ? is do you care?
Remember when Portman was tweeting incessantly about his "concern" about opioids? He'll still vote for this.
GOP leaders put $45b for opioids in their 1st Ocare repeal bill. Now it’s gone. http://www.thedailybeast.com/the-latest-obamacare-repeal-bill-doesnt-include-opioid-funding-once-deemed-critical … via @desiderioDC
It's also important that you take on those in your own party who want to throw millions off of their healthcare. But you'll sit on the fence
You don't have the courage to tell McConnell and Graham that you won't support their efforts to dismantle the ACA. You'll vote how they say
Tweeting hard about everything EXCEPT #GrahamCassidy is not an effective distraction. Your constituents deserve to know where you stand.
Important for you to reject unfair GOP health care bill. #GrahamCassidy will harm millions of Americans.
It's also important to stabilize the insurance market. Put a stop to the #GrahamCassidy garbage.
how bout how unfair it is to rip healthcare away from millions of ppl? For once vote for your county over your party.
So pissed at the way you are treating the people of Ohio
 But we will have our say and you will never hold another office in our state.
Important that you do what's right.  Vote down #GrahamCassidy.
It's also important that people not have their health care taken from them.  Vote No on #CassidyGraham
How about protect healthcare instead of supporting a horrendous bill that will take it from millions
Vote no on Graham Cassidy!!!!
So you want to protect steel while @realDonaldTrump & @Trump use foreign steel? Sounds like you are giving preferential treatment to someone
Good LTE in The Dispatch today, Dan.
@senrobportman quiet about Graham-Cassidy:
Thanks! I really am trying everything possible...
You need to read this: https://tcf.org/content/commentary/five-reasons-latest-repeal-replace-effort-may-worst/ … You obviously don't understand what you are voting for! #noGrahamCassidy
And here's why you are ignoring the people of Ohio. You are rewarding the people who paid for your Senate seat.
Wonder no more. The Koch donor network will give GOP $400M for 2018 *only if ACA is repealed* & tax reform passes https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/26/koch-network-piggy-banks-closed-republicans-healthcare-tax-reform …
Where is the funding for opioids? If you're going to sell out, at least get a good price. You're letting our money go to Alabama!
More than happy to chat with you about how to really create some jobs for Ohio.  We are in DC until tomorrow if you want to chat.
Where do you stand on this God awful healthcare bill? That's what Ohioans want to know!
We care much more about hearing you'll vote NO on G-C!
Please vote no on Graham/Cassidy-from widowed disabled mom who needs ACA to cover my minor kids. People, please call Portman at 202-224-3353
First... Ohioans need to be ALIVE to fill all your "proposed" jobs.  So may we suggest you vote NO on this newest assault on the ACA.
What is wrong with you? We are worried about are health insurance .You plan on voting on a bill that is not scored and not debated VOTE NO!
Important that US citizens have access to good health care so we can go to work and keep jobs.
All this twitter activity means a yes on #trumpcare2 ... $382,100 will buy your soul I guess ..... insurance and BIG pharmaceutical donors
Jobs are only helpful if you are healthy enough to actually work. Please protect the health of Ohioans and reject the #GrahamCassidyBill
But will you listen to your constituents and vote no on Graham-Cassidy? That’s what we’d like to hear.
Come on man, you're not fooling anyone, you have to comment on Graham/Cassidy. Not all of your supporters are idiots. NO on G/C prop!!!!!
Like all the steel your bf 45 uses? #giveitup
Tried to call your DC office again today, no answer AGAIN.  Do you give a damn about Americans?
We're worried about healthcare that is affordable Vote NO on repeal and replace.Opiate addicts will die. Don't trust them to do it.
Tell DJT to stop buying Chinese Steel.
Isn't it more important to be a leader than a follower? Why wouldn't you fix the ACA rather than follow your party like a drone, Senator?
Care to share your stance re: Graham-Cassidy?
Unfair? You mean like people making billions off of the suffering of others by gouging then for health care?
This is more important, Senator. Doctors! They know stuff! Just vote NO on #GrahamCassidy.
To #Congress: Graham-Cassidy would result in millions losing coverage, destabilize insurance markets, decrease access to affordable care. 
Pointless to work on this trade issue if you cote to cut #medicaid for #disabled.  @JohnKasich is strongly opposed to #grahamcassiday
We've had unfair trade since Reagan was president, so what's new? After he broke our unions up. Whose gonna protect us? Not you! Vote no.
So now we know why the big push. Your rich donors are threatening withhold $$.
$$ explains it all. Koch network 'piggy banks' closed until GOP passes health and tax reform  | The Guardian https://amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/26/koch-network-piggy-banks-closed-republicans-healthcare-tax-reform …
Please vote NO on Trumpcare. Or all of the country will be hit with a disaster not just Tx and Fl. #Ohio will drown.
Do the right thing vote no,please!
Still bringing up other topics to distract from not addressing Graham-Cassidy are we? An embarrassment to the voters of Ohio!
Call 202-224-3353 or 513-684-3265 to contact
Vote NO on the G-C vulturecare.
You always complain D.C. is broken. So-why don't you work with @PattyMurray & @SenAlexander on bipartisan healthcare bill? Stop the madness!
I'll bet steel workers need healthcare.
Do your job. Save lives don't take them. Vote NO on #GrahamCassidy
You should vote no on the sneaky healthcare bill your colleagues are trying to pass.  Shame on you if you vote Yes.  Do the right thing.
Why don't you brag about Rs killing health care for millions. #town hall. #falefoxnews
How does it feel under the belly of a snake?
And about opioids?
Now the chance to come to a bi partisan agreement to help the ACA is dead. As will be many, many of your constituents if this bill passes.
Clever strategy stealing health insurance from Ohioans so they die and free up #jobs.
Why haven't you stated your position on this horrid health care bill?  This one doesn't even have Medicare for opioid crisis
Because he's going to support it like the gold-digging coward that he is.
HEALTHCARE, nothing more important.
What about Healthcare Portman? You're silence will not be tolerated. You're vote should be no, representing your constituents and all.
Start with taking on Trump!
Vote NO on #GrahamCassidy .  #Louisiana 's own Heath Secretary is against their own Senator's bill.  #ohio #Christian #Catholic
U BETTER NOT VOTE TO TAKE AWAY HEALTHCARE WITH OUT ASKING. UR VOTERS
It's important you and the GOP stop sabotaging Ohioans healthcare and costing the state 2.5 billion in Medicaid.
How about protecting Medicaid??? SAD!!!
I assume this is sarcasm. If so, I love it.
Hey, vote No on Graham-Cassidy bill. Thanks.
Keep tweeting ever 5 seconds to take focus off of u getting ready to vote to take healthcare away from 30M people

Important that you vote NO on this new healthcare bill that is as far from healthcare as you can get! This bill is worse than the others!!
Americans deserve #MedicareForAll!
French, Italian, Canadian, Spanish, & Danish people share their experiences with universal healthcare.

Americans deserve #MedicareForAll! 
You are elected. You are a representative. You work for us. Stop working for lobbyists and anyone that pays you. Do your job.
It's like you're going out of your way to tweet about everything but healthcare today. If you're not listening, you're not doing your job.
Senator, you are too cowardly to discuss healthcare, but we will know how you vote. You can't hide from us.
Please vote NO #GrahamCassidyBill
Agree that! Senator I am reading that the opioid treatment $$ you so advocated for has been stripped from the Graham bill. Your comment Sir?
No comments, just 140 characters, like his hero.
Important that you take on this unfair Graham-Cassidy healthcare bill- no preexisting conditions, lifetime caps, no pregnancy care mandates
Oh, and no opioid $$& and decimates Medicaid.  VOTE NO!!!
Healthcare is a much bigger concern for Americans. Vote NO ON G-C.

I've had metastatic cancer. Last night I was sobbing just watching my kids do their homework, grateful to be here for it. This is heartless. https://twitter.com/AGSchneiderman/status/909859641873575937 …
We don't have to call Senator Brown. It's YOU. And we can't call you because your box is full. HEALTHCARE.

It’s also important that you don’t vote to kick Ohioans off their coverage & give insurance companies free reign. Vote NO on #GrahamCassidy
Do you have anything to say about Trumpcare?  It's also kinda important to #Ohio
No it's important that you don't vote to kill thousands of your constituents. Kill Graham-Cassidy. People over profits
Ohio's GOP supermajority gov't has taken us backward, now the 3rd worst unemployment in the US. #Jobs
https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm …
More people in Ohio will lose health care access and die if you vote in favor of Graham-Cassidy. Is that a win b/c then their jobs are open?
Again,  we need to talk about the new health care bill that is being jammed through without any meaningful debate!

#MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
Our @will_c_fischer says #GrahamCassidy is just #TrumpCare with a new name and still takes health care away from thousands of #veterans. 
What about the much larger number of jobs in other industries? Are you thinking any thoughts about them? Say, retail. Or in Ohio, all fields
Do you know how many #jobs will be lost when you vote for #TrumpCare?
Vote no on the #GrahamCassidyDeathBill !
Unfair... unfair... Like changing the rules so your chosen candidate can be confirmed for SCOTUS?
MULTIMILLIONAIRE @senrobportman plans to STEAL healthcare from MILLIONS of Americans to give MASSIVE TAX CUTS to the RICH!!!
