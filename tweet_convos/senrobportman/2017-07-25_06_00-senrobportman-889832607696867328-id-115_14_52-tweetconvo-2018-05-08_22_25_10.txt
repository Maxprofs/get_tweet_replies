How many Americans will be saved if we repeal ObamaCare?

Senator Portman, when is your next town hall meeting? #RequestTallyNo.658
Great - how 'bout bipartisan health care reform given the time it's due? NO on a procedural vote today. These proposals are bad for Ohio.
Please suppress your greed Sen Portman
Smartest thing an American could do right now is not to listen to anyone who supports democrats...
ya left the union's

#PortmanVoteNo
Listen to Ohio leadership, our governor is fighting for a bipartisan healthcare bill. Please listen to Ohio! Voting YES today will hurt Ohio
He did it again! Voted against the people!
He showed this true colors today. Shameful day for Ohio and all of America.
I hate him!
#PortmanVoteNo

#PortmanVoteNo
Your vote on the MTP is disappointing.  You have let your constituents down AGAIN.
Watch out! Trump owns DOJ.
Keep that bi-partisan spirit and work to create a health care bill that helps us all, don't cave to McConnell's stealth wealth care bill!
WHY DON'T ANY OF YOUR OFFICES ANSWER THE PHONE ?
I'm glad you have experience with being bipartisan. Perhaps you. Oils apply that to fixing the ACA? #ACA #KillTheBill
great job!! Now, how about a "no" vote on healthcare. Protect the health of Americans and Ohioans.  #FixACA

#PortmanVoteNo

If GOP votes to proceed to a bill w/ no text, no hearings, no CBO score, no clarity on Byrd rule, they deserve the fiasco they're inviting.
Vote NO on repeal
That's GREAT Rob; but today you should be talking about Healthcare. More pointedly; that you're voting NO.
#PortmanVoteNo
You will not be reelected.  You have no compassion for the poor or the elderly.   Please resign.  #VoteNoOnPortman
In 2009, McConnell *literally* said this: “We shouldn’t rush again on something as important & costly as health care.” Is it not true today?
Two of my dearest loves depend on http://Medicaid.You  have the power to save their lives today, please be a hero. Vote No.(OH zip 43201)
could PRESIDENT PENCE help UNITED States?
Good job!  Maybe Trump Models venture from years ago should be brought under the spotlight.
Why do you care more about protecting people from being trafficked than you do keeping them healthy?
Vote NO on today's #healthcare bill. How this process has been conducted in secret is shameful! Your constituents deserve better! #ohio
Does anyone remember what happened to the last group of politicians who voted for a highly unpopular Pardison healthcare bill?
Vote to Repeal only today.
My healthcare depends on senators like you, Mr. Portman. Put your people before politics. #FixACA #Save32Mil #HealthcareMatters
Awful process. Awful bill. Today's the day you were elected for - to  ignore the KOCH/PAC $$ and STAND WITH US. It's pass or fail. VOTE NO!

Sir, you know this is a bad bill for Ohio. Stand firm and vote NO. This is about millions losing healthcare.
Why is sex illegal, Senator?
Are you going to fight to protect the countless women and girls who stand to lose medical services?
These girls you're so concerned about have been sexually assaulted—is that a preexisting condition, in your eyes? #VoteNoTrumpcare
Choices-follow party or do what you know is just &humane @senrobportman @SenSusanCollins @SenCapito @lisamurkowski @SenDeanHeller @SenateGOP
This is great! But right now the workers of Ohio are more concerned with health care! VOTE NO this plan is just as bad as Obamacare!!
Why are you not answering your phones? Been trying for two days. Why are you hiding? #coward
HEALTH CARE
And a NO vote on TrumpCare today!
How will you vote on the healthcare today? Why do you continue to hide from the people of Ohio? Vote no.
Strong communities need smart planning. Please vote to keep equal affordable access to quality healthcare. Build safety with smart #ideas
Are you an actual senator if your D.C. phone goes straight to VM, your CLE mailbox is always full, & your Cbus phone isn't even working?
Vote no today on the health care bill.   Listen to your constituents who want our current system fixed!!!!
Important work and we thank you.
But TODAY we need your pledge to save healthcare reforms!
No on MTP. No on BRCA. No on ACA repeal.
I'd love a year & a half of bipartisan efforts towards health care! DO THE RIGHT THING TODAY. VOTE NO on #Trumpcare
Lots of info on stopping sex trafficking: good.

But @senrobportman, what about healthcare? VOTE NO TODAY.

Sincerely, a constituent #NoAHCA
Vote no, Rob.  Use your head.
Senator, We demand to see the healthcare bill and have full, public hearings prior to any debate in the US Senate. Governor Kasich said no.
Repeal or resign #MAGA
how about some bipartisan investigating on fixing our healthcare, Rob, instead of the current charade you have going with Mitch?
What could be bipartisan: #healthcare. What's criminal: You supporting the Motion to Proceed on an unknown healthcare bill. #NoMTP #KeepACA
Drain the swamp and start with you
‘It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends’  (J.K. Rowling)
Thanks for bipartisan work. Any chance you could try this with healthcare? Vote No Today! 1934 days. #countdown2022 #fdevos

Please vote no on tRumpcare.  Not healthcare but tax cut for the rich.  The majority of constituents are NOT rich and need healthcare.
I would like to know where you stand on the health care proposal.
Remember today that two weeks ago you were at a doctors office.  Imagine if this vote today meant you didn't have healthcare. #VoteNo
No on Senate health care bill.
Pretty sure no one is talking about this today. Stop hiding from us, vote NO! #Trumpcare #thenorthremembers
@senrobportman Your party is careening towards the edge with a reckless health care vote and you're tweeting about brothels?! #incompetent
TY for this. Please vote no on health bill...it has not been scrutinized or vetted properly. This is not what I or MOST Ohioans want.

Thats great. Now go vote against the senate healthcare bill. It is bad for ohio.



EVERYONE is watching you, Senator.  We are waiting to see if you do listen and really represent us. Just VOTE NO on MTP.
Senator, healthcare is too important to be sacrificed for a political win 4 the president.  Vote no today.

6- What could you possibly negotiate @robportman that would be worth making health care much more expensive for everyone?

This veteran is doing whatever she can to protect her son from the Republican health care bill 
What about your support of Trump? You are complicit with this mad man. Vote NO on this health care debacle. The world is watching you.
You researched this for almost 2 yrs but will rip healthcare from over 23 million by voting on a bill you have yet to see. You're ridiculous
Vote no today @senrobportman
Repeal Obamacare
Vote NO on healthcare repeal
Why should I care about trafficking? Explain it to me.  Why doesn't your beloved individual responsibility apply to those victims?
HOLIER THAN THOU?  YET YOU WILL VOTE TODAY TO CONDEM MILLIONS TO DEATH AND PAIN. SAD.
It's like you just want to keep on your favorite projects which would have worked with a normal admin.
That's if we still have a DOJustice this President is attempting to make it the Department of Trump Defense. Stand up Senator and be counted
Please stand for Ohio and do what is right for us and don't just pass a bill to make the president happy. We Are Your Constituents, VOTE NO
Thank you for doing the right thing in this case. Please do the right thing today and vote no on healthcare!
Vote no today on the repeal and replace debacle. A yes vote makes my kids uninsurable because of pre-existing conditions. 1of23million
Vote no on #Trumpcare
Today is about HEALTHCARE.  Nothing else matters.

The criminals will be here tomorrow.

PLEASE VOTE NO
You might wanna tell your hero of the GOP how long a thorough investigation takes and you better be the people's side today. Remember us.
Don't vote to kill me today
Keep your eye on the ball and stop deflecting us Rob. We deserve better than that from you. Simple question - do you stand with Ohio or GOP?
#FullRepeal
Vote NO on health care.
#Trumpcare
answer your phones. vote no on MTP. this is not how  legislating is supposed to work. will you do what's right or what's easy?
He'll do whatever the Supreme Oompa Loompa tells him as he's incapable of original thought and a slave to Russian money.
VOTE NO TODAY. Don't harm your constituents! #Trumpcare
Too bad you don't have an AG to do anything about it...
