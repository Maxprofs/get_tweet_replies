Eliminating the estate tax only benefits the rich. It is only levied on the portion of an estate’s value that exceeds $5,490,000 per person.
Reducing the top tax bracket from 39.6% to 35% only benefits people with taxable incomes greater than $418,4000(single) or $470,700(couple).
Reducing corporate taxes doesn't guarantee that any corporation will use the savings to create new jobs or to pay its average workers more.
It is yet to be seen whether or how the GOP tax plan would directly benefit the middle class, because the details aren't fleshed out.
White House Chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, has said he can't even guarantee that taxes won't go up for some middle-class families.
This is not the time for spin. This is the time for truth telling and full disclosure.
You are a liar!
“Please believe all this crap so I can give rich people more money”......do I have it right?
Give REAL tax relief to poor and middle class.  DO NOT give to top 1%
Wish you had integrity - you know these ‘tax reforms’ are not helping. A tax increase for working people from 10 to 12% is not a reduction!
Minimum Wage increase, healthcare, unions.
it will help opioid crisis too.

You Sir are a liar, always have been and will never change.
Too bad the plan you unveiled doesn't do any of that.

This is not #TaxReform these are #TaxCuts for the wealthy-- #lies
Trickle-down has never and never will work. Stop trying to sell us discredited economic theories.
Without screwing over the middle class, I might add. Especially those of us who fall on the lower end of that spectrum.
Lets have a in person town hall meeting to discuss this issue, among others!
In order to cut taxes, you must 1st cut spending. Or are you under the misguided perception US doesn't have any debt? Simple economics.
Reports are suggesting the current tax proposal is terrible for the middle class. My guess is you already know this.
I don't want anything done until we see his tax returns. What is he hiding? Why is he lying to us?
Please do the right thing not the thing the right wants you to do.
Is the Republican tax proposal a bailout for Trump? Who know? We haven't seen his taxes.
Have you READ this?  Shame on you!!
Please make sure the tax code does not hurt but helps small businesses, the middle class and the children of Ohio in poverty. #OhioVoter
Tax experts agree: GOP #TaxReform will only benefit 1% of Americans. Everyone else is screwed. #Greed
The current plan in no way helps families & workers - will you ignore that reality or do what's right?
Tax reform will help who? You? That fool in the WH?  Make the  rich pay their share, then talk to those who are struggling. #BEFAIRORQUIT
Ooook liberal lowlife.  If you really cared you would have repealed Obama care its fine RINO we'll vote you out soon enough.
Eliminating the deduction for local and state taxes results in a significant tax increase for many of your residents.  #DoTheRightThing
Trickle down DOES NOT WORK
#TaxPlan #1% - Yeah if only that was what the GOP were proposing.  #Kleptocracy
Please explain how repealing the estate tax helps the economy or 99% of Ohio families.
Mr Portman , where are these $1,000 new cars for sale that the White House says I can buy with my huge tax cut? Asking for a friend
Not the reform that's been revealed this week.  It's a shameful handout to the wealthy.
Genuine tax reform esp. for working class, mid. class & poor would help. This is wealthcare. #NoTaxCutsForRich
You don't lie well.
Hey, Rob, instead of taking time to make a video, how about getting on this instead! #CHIP
How will the economy get moving by taking away all my tax deductions and increasing my tax rate? Estate tax & AMT don't apply to me.
This corrupt version of tax reform will not help. Are you a representative of the people or a spokesman for Trump? You can't be both.
Jobs are already happening!  You look like a hostage of the Koch Brothers Cartel! Blink if you are giving billions away to them! #kochaddict
LIAR! Greedy sc...bag!
This is bullshit, the plan RAISES the lowest bracket and essentially eliminates itemized deductions, how does that help families & workers?
Raise taxes on the wealthy not on the poor. The #GOP #TaxReform does the opposite of that. We all know trickle down economics doesn't work.
I guess that's why the GOP plan would increase the lowest tax rate from 10 percent to 12 percent. To get the economy moving.
Stop. Lying. You. Hypocritical. Lying. Scheming. #robberbaron
U stayed silent on healthcare which would have hurt middle and working class, & now big fan of #TaxReform Do you hate Ohioans? #Resist
GOP #TaxReform makes foreign income made by American companies tax-free. How does that bring back #jobs?
I can tell you are not up for re-election rob.
Then give incentives & tax breaks to the people who drive the economy: CONSUMERS, the real job creators! The wealthy don't drive an economy.
RICH WHITE MAN IN A SUIT wants us to believe that this tax plan will help us and not help him and OTHER RICH WHITE MEN IN SUITS. No.
Rob. If you aren't going to listen to your constituents, please just be quiet.
Review how trickle down economics worked after Reagan proposed that. Didn't help the middle class or the poor. Let's learn from mistakes.
Clearly Rob doesn't see it as a "mistake".
And how does your taking under the table payola help Ohio or the economy #Pay4PlayRob?
Help people who need help not multimillionaires and billionaires. There's a national debt to pay down and you all want to cut taxes 4 the 1%
What a joke! Your plan helps the wealthy & will widen gap of rich & poor! Feel sorry for the suckers who supported Trump. Screwed again!
Translation:  Tax cuts for my corporate donors, and hikes for the working class.  “Fiscal responsibility,” is just a thing I say.
#TaxReform might help that. Your #KochTaxCut however won't accomplish any of that!
In case you haven't noticed employment is up, the economy is well. Working families need a living wage, however.
What r u doing about the CHIP that expires soon? Millions of families & children will b left without coverage??
You dont know what we need, #BotPortman. You wont even mention healthcare, which we NEED. You wont have a #REALTownHallNOW, which we NEED.
If you want to "do this right," you'll start by having the very rich pay their fair share.
If you like "analyses," you'll recognize that analyses show tax cuts for the wealthy neither stimulate growth nor pay for themselves.
What do tax cuts for the wealthy do? Make the rich richer and increase the deficit, which is something conservatives are supposed to oppose.
I wish you had tweeted as much about #healthcare as you do about #taxreform
Total repeal of the estate tax is an exciting opportunity for ultra-rich like Koch Bros & most of the WH.  Hiding behind fig leaf of farms.
How about all you cats in congress making the same minimum wage you propose for voters? Sounds like equal protection of the law.
#TrumpTaxScam
This appears to most of us to be a tax cut for the richest 1% of Americans... Feel free to explain
RAISE #PayrollTax on GOV #Paychecks & it will Balance #SOONER with less #DEBT & or #Deficit Spending. #FACT IS its $200B per year $2T in 10y
So middle class I own a home tax plan will take away my mortgage interest deduction. If wealthy and owned 10 homes I get a huge tax cut?  NO
No it won't, Senator Portman. Please read the proposal and tell us all specifically how most Americans benefit. Waiting eagerly for details.
TRICKLE DOWN DOESN’T WORK. STOP GIVING THE WEALTHY & BIG BIZ TAX BREAKS. Close loopholes so they must pay. Period.
If you want to reform taxes reform taxes, tax CUTS do not work #Kansas
@senrobportman is a god damn liar!!
How does giving tax breaks to wealthy folks and corporations help Ohio families and workers?
We can not move forward while Tom Price steals our tax $$$! Makes the party look bad!!! Get him out!
Why do you think we'll believe the lie that tax cuts for the rich will benefit the rest of us? The world has NEVER worked that way.
NO it wont ....typical 'trickle down' NON economics
Liar! This is taking from the working class & giving to the rich!
Does it bother you that you support Moore who hates your son? YOUR SON?
Hey look. It's @senrobportman, once again proving that he's a corporate shill. You serve your donors, Rob. You clearly don't care about me.
Why do you want to give tax breaks to the Koches and make middle class Ohioans pay for them by eliminating their personal deductions?
not what your party is proposing...will do nothing for us w small incomes..
#Brownback DESTROYED the Kansas ecomomy.. DESTROYED is with a tax reform play that has now been adopted by Cohn/trump... DESTROYED!
GOP: Grifters On Parade. #TaxReform is a gift to our Liar-In-Chief, & Rob is a shameless salesman for #kleptocracy.
Yes he is.
#TaxPlan
@GOP is proposing to take away personal deductions away from middle class Ohioans. You good with that?
You need to take a look at the Kansas economy that was destroyed by #Brownback state tax reform that is a mirror image of trump's plan.
So why are you advocating for this plan that will do nothing for typical Americans? This a handout to the ultra rich. Tell the truth.
You will tell any lie for a kick back check
You've proven time and again that you not only don't care about Ohio families, but you actually work to hurt them.
you need to re-up #CHIP
Great. Then don’t raise tax rates on the lowest earners and don’t cut the tax rate on the richest and corporations. That would help.
Portman's top donors. They want a tax cut. NOW! Source: http://www.opensecrets.org

Treasury takes down 2012 paper that contradicts Mnuchin's claim that workers benefit most from a corporate tax cut.

 “Trump isn't telling the truth about his tax plan. So I am.”
This is a giveaway to the rich. Stop lying to your constituents. Who do you work for?
& why doesn't #TrumpTaxScam look great for our most vulnerable families?
A few thoughts on this. I’m not seeing *anything* that benefits the lowest-income 35% of TPs, while the top 1% gets trillions of tax cuts. https://twitter.com/Goldfarb/status/913045734366248960 …
