All over Ohio and this country GOP wants to cut Medicaid and increase premiums & deductibles. Instead of stopping it, Portman facilitates it

@realDonaldTrump and administration needs to see this. Needs to be investigated and arrests should be made
You sold out your state and nation for millionaires #shame #greed
It is Immoral to take healthcare away from millions of people!
Please introduce legislation to strengthen punishments for those promoting human trafficking. Thank you for the transparency about backpage
How are you voting on healthcare? You're deflecting attention w/ your numerous platitudes. Ohioans want to know your stance on healthcare
What the hell is wrong with you? You work for the damn people, our country! Not traitorous @POTUS making mockery of Constitution, democracy!
You're right. Human trafficking is a scandal. We have lots of scandals happening in the US. Don't let out healthcare system become one.
58% ($12.1mil) of @senrobportman $$ not from #OHIO. That ain't right! #Endcitizensunited Vote #Trumpcare Restrict #Backpage #Resist
Trump helped Russia to mess in our election. Where's your outrage for that? Put country before party
oh yes they are bad guys , like you who totes  the party line on ACA ... way to be a party princess Rob... who cares about Ohioans? not you

Perhaps you should read this if you mean what you say.
Thankful some heroes are fighting to preserve and restore #dignity.
We know that hc isn't on the top of your list of 'the right things to do'. Get to work and stop tweeting. You're acting like our fake leader
Repeal Obamacare. VA has proven that the government is horrible at managing anything
Please start focusing on Obamacare and tax reform and budget and the wall!
Hey Rob, save our Health Care....@senrobportman
I hope you are seriously concerned and NOT just trying to distract Ohioans from healthcare debacle! #pleasevoteNOonTrumpcare
Will all victims get the same kind of Justice or treatment or is there a tier system? How about going after the rich men who buy them?
Facilitated it just as you are facilitating 45. Trump raped/abused 13 yr old girl. Why do you pretend you don't know this and support him?
Yes, good people try to help the most vulnerable and some just hide from their constituents and vote for donors
Please say no to Trumpcare.  Bad for disabled children, bad for opiode crisis!
You are obsessed with this topic that affects so few Ohioans.  What about the damaging Medicaid cuts in the latest Senate bill?  Vote no!
Stop tweeting about anything other than healthcare or are you afraid to admit you are voting for it. #votenoportman
Also, please consider holding gun owners financially responsible for damages, may curb the violence in our country.  Make everyone happy?
All over #Ohio and our country GOP in Congress is trying to take healthcare away from working class American people. #VoteNo on Senate bill
Please listen to health experts who oppose the Senate health bill. Drs., nurses, and health insurers oppose because of harm to US families.
Agreed something needs to b done about trafficking!  A lot of men just don't get it,ex 16 year old, assumed hooker rather than victim
Also I feel totally justified replying so many times after receiving daily mail from your campaign for months #ethics #faker
Also the president you support is a sexual offender and I wish you would shut up
Unless you vote no on hc.
And if your unable to admit there is a spectrum of challenges, I am offended and don't need your help
Men like that also participate in date rape and sexual harassment. If you want to support change, address the spectrum of issues please
If I'm not supposed to care if other people have healthcare why should I care if they are trafficked?
Tell me more about how much you hate criminal complicity.
14% of US  like the GOP healthcare bill...did the GOP forget.."by the people for the people"
Those involved need to be prosecuted to the fullest extent. Thank you Senator Portman.
Your social media staff is baffling.  Constituents are on the edge of their seats waiting for your opinion on healthcare. . .
22 MILLION. people who will suffer and be disenfranchised BECAUSE OF YOUR VOTE.
@senrobportman PLEASE READ THIS THREAD
My friend, who is stage IV. She advocates daily, helps others daily.
1. Hey healthy friends: I love you. I really do. But we need to have a talk, about how you can be a good friend right now.

Cancer survivor shares with staffers of GOP Rep. Lamar Smith a powerful story about how Obamacare helped extend the life of a friend. 

This is seven-year-old Myka, who was born with a congenital heart defect. I’m fighting for children like Myka each and every day. #SaveACA 
What about health care, where are you on the vote?

Children’s hospitals agree: the Republican health care bill would be devastating & have life-or-death consequences.

Face your constituents. Have a townhall. Don't be a coward.

This is Evan. When Republicans talk about cutting Medicaid & giving tax cuts to the wealthy, it’s health care for kids like him on the line. 
Say no to the healthcare bill. We need single payer.

DIRECTIVE 

Action Call…
All over #Ohio and our country, multimillionaire @senrobportman wants to steal healthcare from MILLIONS to give TAX CUTS to the RICH!!!

Fixing healthcare takes putting us, we the people, before your party! Either fix the #ACA or give us #MedicareForAll.

6. Admin claims states can innovate! When experts lay out state "flexibility" if TCare passes, it's:
-cut ppl
-deny svs…
