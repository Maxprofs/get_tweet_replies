It's Cavs time now. Not for long because Celtics gotta compete next season - watch!
The future no one knows and the past, no  one cares. 
Right now, we #defendtheland all the way to play offs. Take the pain to the #DubNation
Hehe 
I'm only cheering for y'all because I hate the Warriors
We can hate the warriors together!
This series will go 7 games!!!
So you are a Cavs fan?!?!
Psssst did you guys forget about 2015???
Everybody else would like to
But we 3pete'd the ECF! I mean that's an accomplishment as well.
We lost.
We didn't win the championship, but we won the ECF 3 years in a row. I mean obviously if we've been to the finals 3 years in a row.
Correct. It says back to back to back.
Does it?? It only had 2016 & 2017 on the bottom... huh
Oh. I get it. This is the 16/17 season lol.
