If this bill passes, my 3 y.o. child will lose health insurance by age 7. She is not a drug addict. #ProtectOurCare
No one thinks you care about women, Rob.
Agreed. @senrobportman only cares about donors. He doesn't even have a real stance on #Trumpcare For it until it won't pass anyway. #Coward
AKA hiding behind @SenatorCollins skirt as my Grandma would have said. #Delphos #AllenCounty #QuitYourJobRob
https://www.facebook.com/Jeffersoncounty/ …  Dear Ohio Legislator,
Not going to be able to do it without healthcare!!!  #NOTRUMPCARE
Your role would be to make sure Ohioans keep their healthcare. Do not support Trumpcare!
...so glad ur listening...thx 4 continuing 2 work 4 the RIGHT healthcare bill. Work WITH Dems/ FIX what exists. REJECT repeal/replace  THX!
But only if you don't vote to cut their care.
Great cause. But there are many others. You work for ALL of us. No to ACA repeal. #ProtectOurCare
And you'll still vote for #wealthcare because party over country
Please don't sell those women short by voting yes on the #wealthcare bill! They're counting on you, @senrobportman -- as we all are! #voteNO
Fraud.
If you really care about fighting addiction, don't take away Medicaid .

Yes to ACA Healthcare, mental healthcare, reproductive care, well child care. Rehabilitation. Vote no on Trumpcare.
Don't cut healthcare that will take all their progress backwards!!!
Your role includes voting no on this abomination of a health care bill.
Women would also like healthcare, as well as the right to decide what to do with our own bodies.
Rob, you need to STOP paying lip service to addicts. You CANNOT care about the opiate epidemic yet vote for the #AHCA, you just can't!
You care so much about the opiate epidemic that you want to vote to strip treatment for addiction & mental health! SHAME!!!
ARE you REALLY LISTENING? Arrest the PIMPS! Arrest the JOHNS that pay PIMPS! FINE DRUG CO's that flood dr's office. Arrest ONE Dr
NO TAX CUT
Of course, they will be on their own under Trumpcare, since being female and an addict are pre-existing conditions. #hypocrite #liar
Did you hear from women how much they enjoy not being penalized on the cost of their healthcare for being women?
Did Medicaid help any of them? I bet it did!

Stay strong on opposing Wealthcare!
Hopefully the will be recover before your #trumpcare bill takes affect.
Stand up for women and children. Medicaid, the EPA, Paris--shame on you, Senator.
Yet you are apparently deaf to the fact that women's health issues are not included in the GOP health bill. #ACA #SenateHealthBillSucks
Cutting Medicaid for these women is a death sentence.
You know what helps women in this situation? Addiction treatment covered by HEALTH INSURANCE. 

And GYN coverage while you're at it. #NoBCRA
I will be 7 years sober this October.  It CAN be done!   Thank God I had good health insurance to get the help I needed 
I'm very proud of you! Congratulations on your sobriety. You rock, sister. 
These folks will lose their healthcare when GOP repeals ACA. #justmean
We sure do - guarantee them good healthcare instead of the GOP deathcare, Rob.
Thank you for discussing women's healthcare. Please tell us all the ways Trumpcare will effect it!
Hmmm...basic healthcare is necessary for a decent life. You might consider that as you work to take it away.
Agreed. We also don't want to see these folks turned away from the healthcare they need. Please don't support this disaster called trumpcare
it's even harder if Medicaid is destroyed by the GOP #standupforohioans
Tell us what you actually understand about addiction,  and healthcare.
Hi! Help us all - stand up to Trump's alternative facts & dangerous behavior #principals
ACA assures Ohioans' health insurance includes coverage for addiction treatment & mental health services. Proposed bill does not. Vote No
I believe your role is to keep healthcare coverage for addiction. Currently an EHB-  not necessarily under GOP plan. #SaveMedi#SavetheACA
Not if you vote on that healthcare abomination. Protect the people of Ohio and America!
Your role should be voting NO on any bill that cuts Medicaid.
Won't be covered under the #Trumpcare , vote no!
Senator your role is to preserve the ACA's addiction treatment coverage. Is it in the GOP health bill? If not, your words are hollow.
Make sure they can get medical care. Vote NO on the BRCA.
Is their treatment free? Or do they need insurance?
So when is your town hall?
It is as easy as making a choice Rob. Just like making the choice to stick a needle in your arm is a choice. THX 4 not calling it a disease.
Your role is to deprive millions of their much needed and much deserved healthcare. 1,000s of deaths/yr on your conscience!
Your GOP's addiction is power and money. Try fixing that you coward!
LIAR
We need healthcare--ACA, not the fake one.  It's just a tax cut for the rich.  Do your duty as our representative and vote NO.
Did you tell them that your party wants to take their healthcare? Addiction is likely a preexisting condition and #GOP takes away from them.
So please oppose @SenateGOP #trumpcare bill. It cuts addiction care from essential benefits. $ sweeteners not enough
What is your role to play?
Yes but don't trade $$ for addiction over Medicaid in healthcare plan!
How about talking with families with children with developmental disabilities???? We matter, too.
When has government EVER been successful at waging wars on drugs? EVER?!? It’s time for a NEW approach.

91 Americans die every day from opioid overdose. @SenateGOP repeal bill doesn’t seem to care.
Again, this seems like a wonderful program. What will happen to it if Medicaid is cut?
Is your role that of the mean guy who takes away healthcare for ppl who need it most?
Your role is to NOT strip away health insurance from millions.
Your role is to preserve these peoples' access to health care. Not some bargain-basement plan; the real thing. Stay focused.
The ACA has a big role to play too. #FixTheACA #NoCutsNoCaps 
#REALTownHallNOW
How exactly are you helping women? You want to remove their healthcare & back a prez repeatedly accused of rape & sexual assault.
But f um we are killing ACA and replacing it with nothing
Rob looking puzzled by constituents. We are like lobbyists just not as rich.
