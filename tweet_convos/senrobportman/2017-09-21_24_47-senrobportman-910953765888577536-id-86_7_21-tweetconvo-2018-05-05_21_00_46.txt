But if you don’t vote no on the #GrahamCasiddy bill, these kids will be left with nothing!
Sounds like an excellent program.  Lets make sure they can keep their healthcare. Thank you for taking care of your constituents.   :)
That you could have your staff tweet out stuff like this & vote for the Republicon death bills at the same time must be you are a sociopath.
Senator, you're taunting us now. I hope you do not vote to have those kids' health care compromised.
My disabled kid won't be able to do much if you take his health insurance away! This bill is OBSCENE for children w/ disabilities. #SHAME!
You know what else disabled kids, all of whom have preexisting conditions, need?  Affordable healthcare. Vote no #GrahamCassidy #TrumpCare
Adequate #healthcare is just as important! Vote NO on #GrahamCassidy #NotAHealthCareBill

please stop pretending you care about ANY kids, disabled or otherwise
and I'm sure they'd appreciate your #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
You post something like this when you're playing coy about taking away benefits these kids need? Say no to #GrahamCassidy and end this now.
These kids need adequate health care,  most for the rest of their lives, to live up to their full potential. G-C cuts coverage for kids.
Vote no on GC to help that work continue. Medicaid largely covers the elderly and disabled. We all deserve healthcare. #ProtectOurCare
you want to help people but you continually back health care bills that will only hurt.  #taxcutsfortherich #racist
Senator Portman, drug prevention and rehabilitation need affordable and comprehensive healthcare. Something GrahamCassidy will NOT provide.
My disabled child needs to keep his Medicaid or he may have to be put in a home. Which I can't afford in the remotest.
All of these disabled kids have pre-existing conditions that will not be covered under G-C. You must vote "no" or this is just hypocrisy.
They will need serious life skills if they want to afford healthcare. #NoToGrahamCassidy
Most services like speech pathology and occupational therapy for children with disabilities is paid for by Medicaid. No #trumpcare
Thank you for visiting LifeTown today! 
All the kids who attend are helped by Medicaid, are you ready to cut it by voting for #GrahamCassidy
#ACA can be fixed WITH bipartisan work @senrobportman. Ohio will remember you put party over Ohio's citizens. Vote NO GRAHAM-CASSIDY
Hypocrite
Too bad you #GOP will gut all programs so 1% gets more $ #GrahamCassidyBill  #SNAP #Medicare 
https://t.co/4e9eiFyd2V?amp=1
Are you totally TONE DEAF?THESE KIDS NEED ACA! CG provides NOTHING for Seniors,Disabled,Kids Women,PreExists,Vets! ALL HEATH ORGS OPPOSE! NO
Vote no on GrahamCassidy!!!
Don't talk to us about drug prevention and kids with disabilities and then vote to gut our safety nets and these kids health care Medicaid
If care one bit about kids you will vote no on the draconian healthcare bill like a real humanitarian or are the Koch Brothers in charge
You keep talking about healthcare programs as if we don't know you've continually voted to take healthcare away from us
Life Town is a great program. You know what else is important? HEALTHCARE for the diabled. VOTE NO ON GRAHAM CASSIDY. PLEASE
Too bad it won't be covered under that monstrosity of a healthcare bill we all know you'll vote 4 because of ur donors! #spinelessrobportman
Did you put on a good show? Did you use your concern look?
Did you ask them what their opinion was on the Graham-Cassidy Bill?
Please vote NO on Graham-Cassidy to protect health care to kids with disabilities, and those suffering from addiction. #KeepKidsCovered
Then you should appreciate the ACA and oppose #GrahamCasiddy , right?
But you are voting literally to take away #medicaid services including education for the #disabled kids. How can you justify that. #notProps
Too bad that without your vote against Graham-Cassidy they won’t be healthy enough to learn those skills
#GrahamCassidy SCREWS disabled kids over big time!
(And their families, too!)

Don't tweet pics, OPPOSE THE BILL!

#whereyouatRob
#NoGCHJ
You may as well tweet about healthcare, because that’s what all the replies are going to be about.
That you can tweet this, while being "open" to Graham-Cassidy and silent on what that bill will do to this program & disabled kids is rotten
If you value your job, you will vote against healthcare repeal. Otherwise you will be voted out.
If you really care about the work that LifeTown is doing, vote “no” on Graham-Cassidy.
Families w/disabled kids also need the best health care available, like you get, not what comes w/Graham-Cassady bill. Vote NO.
Too bad you're about to cut off its funding. No to #GrahamCasiddy
Is one of the "important life skills" how to strip millions of healthcare and make it so only the incredibly wealthy can afford to get sick?
Kiss that program goodbye unless you #VoteNOGrahamCassidy. Your life won't be affected but ours will, see how that works?
hold a Town Hall this weekendI'm sure your constituents want to know why you're "on the fence" with "their" healthcare#NoRepeal
#VoteNOGrahamCassidy death bill
CONMAN @senrobportman voted to STEAL coverage from 200,000 Ohioans a year receiving substance abuse treatment through Medicaid!!!
MILLIONAIRE @senrobportman wants to GUT Ohio healthcare funding by $161 BILLION, so he & his BILLIONAIRE donors can get MASSIVE TAX CUTS!!!
NO on #GrahamCassidy. Leaves Americans (disabled) uninsured, ends the ban on lifetime caps, charges more for pre-existing conditions.
Ohioans appreciate the Affordable Care Act. We don't appreciate #GrahamCassidy nor spineless, lying, amoral politicians.
Stop trying to change the subject! Your support of Graham Cassidy could literally kill your constituents like drugs. VOTE NO!
Everyone needs to call! Tell portman to vote NO if he TRULY CARES about drug prev! Or kids. Or ppl being allowed to breathe.
He doesn't care about doing the right thing.  What he cares most about above anything else is his political survival.  He's a politician!
It's all about $$$.... PORTMAN wants to kill Obamacare R's can give HUGE TAX CUTS TO WEALTHY   -
Did you let them know once you vote yes on G-C they will lose Medicaid funding? Or about lifetime caps? Pre-existing conditions? Vote No.
Vote NO on ACA repeal.
Lifetown  we all appreciate what you do.  The problem that lies before us now the #GrahamCassidyBill, will not benefit Ohio.
You do realize that disabled kids have a desperate need for healthcare, right?
Did you see the deal @lisamurkowski   got ? Pretty much tells you this Cassidy Graham bill is no better than ACA. Really a lot worse!
I love this Akron Beacon Editorial board's takedown of your blatant hypocrisy in regards to your opioids rhetoric.
Hypocrisy yes! But first and foremost he's a politician (on the wrong side of this issue), and politicians have one concern: their survival.
How many of those disabled kids will be priced out of health coverage by #GrahamCassidy?
Vote NO!
But what about your vote on the newest Trumpcare?  That will matter even more for their lives. VOTE NO.
Hope it works because if they develop an addiction, The #GrahamCassidyBill  will deny them the help in the future.
Covering essential health benefits is also important for drug prevention/recovery and for kids w disabilities #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
Kids with disabilities & their families probably also appreciate the pre-existing condition protections provided by ACA #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
Appreciate the voice of your constituents. Vote NO on #GrahamCassidy ... keep these programs alive 
Then #ProtectOurCare Senator. Vote no on Cassidy Graham. It strips Ohio of pre-ex protections and what we need to address Opioids.
#GrahamCassidy
The ultimate question on Graham-Cassidy.

Feel free to share if it helps people. 
And how many of these kids will not be protected from pre-existing condition exclusions if #GrahamCassidy passes? Vote no.
Graham-Cassidy will slash Medicaid and funds for opioid treatments... photo ops don't change things, your votes do. VOTE NO on ACA repeal!
#GrahamCassidyNO
