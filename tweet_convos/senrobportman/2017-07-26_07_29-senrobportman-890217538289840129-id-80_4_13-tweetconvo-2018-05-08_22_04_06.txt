200 billion isn't enough to justify gutting medicaid. These are POISON  PILLS to the social safety net & healthcare for many.  VOTE NO!
If the fed gov't wouldn't take so much money there would be more local money to put into the fight. CA takes an unfair share of fed funds.
Now, House is trying to neuter the CBO, a 40+-yr-old org., &   make it into KOCH think tank, because you can't deal w/ truth? IT ALL STINKS!
Do you care about Ohioan's? Hold a town hall so you know what we really need& want!Quit trying to save your rich buddies $$ & save Ohioan's
FACTS: This is not an opioid crisis. It's an addiction crisis. You harm #chronicpain sufferers daily with ignorance about what caused OD.
And I do care about the lives of addicts and their families. Greatly. I cannot advocate for pain w/o caring for them, also. Do you? Really?
Tweet storms are the embarrassment of our current representatives. It shows they are spinning and cannot lead. Stop the madness, pls.
know what else helps fight opioid crisis? #MEDICAID. What are you doing to save it other than voting in secret to repeal ACA?
You have a clear mandate to leave Obamacare intact. You are failing to represent constituents and we will remember. Do not repeal Obamacare.
FIX THE ACA!
Maybe you can ask the insurance companies that donated thousands to your campaign to put that money into helping the opiod crisis. When 1/x
the GOP is finished with HC, the insurance companies won't cover it, Medicaid will be reduced & phased out & ppl will be on their own.
Your Tuesday vote to destroy Medicaid really showed a lot of concern about the opiod crisis.
Grants are temporary. They need, we need, permanent funding. You're passing the buck here, senator.

So the hundreds of thousands of Ohioans who stand to lose health coverage via the @senategop can just apply for a grant.




OK well I'm a recovering opiate addict and if you take away my healthcare it will be a death sent!Plus I had cancer&thats preexisting cond!
I see so u have u staff tweeting every 5 mins to distract your horrendous HC vote so they can't answer the phones
If you vote to repeal the AVA. This program you tout will lose funding. You say one thing and do another. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/health-care-senate-repeal-moderates-mcconnell_us_5978a2c7e4b0c95f3760892a …

The skinny on "skinny repeal" is that it screws us just as much as other  GOP plans.  DON'T SELL US OUT for an inadequate concession.
Vote NO on everything.  No to Skinny Repeal.  Work together with Dems to correct ACA where needed.  This isn't normal business.  #VoteNo
"Jockeying for CARA funding is expected to be very competitive with $267 million available in its first year across the nation"
What happens to communities not lucky enough to get the funding? Why are we pitting communities against each other?
That's nice. But leave my health care alone!!!
Fraud.
Seems odd the places heroin comes from are the places are military is? Build the wall & get out of heroin countries...
Hollow. Your words ring hollow when compared to your votes.
Just stop it. Stop pretending like you care about these families when it's clear all that matters to you are tax cuts. Shameful
Why are tax cuts a bad thing?
Nice they can get help from somewhere, since YOU turned your back on ALL OHIOANS yesterday!
Why do you keep saying #CARA when it's actually the debt?

Baby Killer
Amazed re: how u caved into Reps pressure on health care & appalled that education & now this new ban on trans ppl doesn't have ur thoughts
Be sure to not cut them off from Medicaid with whatever horror McConnell is trying to shove down our throats. Kaisich knows it's wrong.
Maybe health insurance could help. Just a thought.
One OH company has to forego $200K per month in orders because it can't get enough workers who can pass a drug test: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/24/business/economy/drug-test-labor-hiring.html?_r=0 …

Portman & Capito have talked up needing CBO scores. They just voted to waive BCRA's lacking a full CBO score.
CARA would have been great, but you voted not to fund it. Oh those pesky #facts! You are drinking the coolaid with your orange leader!
Why did you vote down the money to fully fund CARA then? Why did you vote last night to gut medicaid? Stop lying to Ohio & yourself.
1,931 days till election day 2022.
So is Medicaid. Vote no.
Key word is "access." It means you have the keys, but no car.
Do not dare tweet about the opioid  crisis while voting to take away healthcare from millions of Ohioans. You are reprehensible.
Maybe don't say anything about health care for a while. You aren't an asset.
Money for addicts but no money for low income, disabled or elderly?
#ConMan @senrobportman & his GOP comrades passed #CARA with $0.00 in funding.... ZIP, ZILCH, NADA!!! #ConManRob #Hypocrite #AllTalkNoAction
All words no action. The GOP has become spineless puppets. You don't represent your constituents. Stabbing every Ohioan in the back daily.
You want to help, put together a  healthcare bill that benefits Americans and not Insurance companies.
A program that's getting results
Are funds available to pay for lawsuits against drug companies that promoted the over prescription of opioids? A friend's daughter just had
her tonsils removed - the doctor prescribed 60 Vicodin SIXTY when I had mine out 53 years ago I got a couple of aspirin and extra ice-cream
PATHOLOGICAL LIAR @senrobportman wants to STEAL coverage from 200,000 Ohioans a yr receiving AOD treatment through Medicaid!!!

#KeepCalling
Do you know what else helps save lives and fight the #opioidcrisis? HEALTHCARE. YOU KNOW THAT THING YOU VOTED AGAINST YESTERDAY!? #hypocrite
The nerve to cite $267 million spread across the nation as fighting the #opioidcrisis after your vote yesterday is the height of hypocrisy.
Your $45 billion in the BCRA is not enough to fight opioids across 50 states over the next decade. Ohio alone spent $1 billion last year.
And that $1 billion? Most of it comes from state and federal #Medicaid spending.
Want to fight drugs in Ohio? Don't vote yes on AHCA. We need Medicaid to fight this epidemic!
He already voted yes.
There will be another vote after the debate though, it isn't set in law yet. Still time for him to do the right thing!

.@SenatorCollins to @ThisWeekABC: GOP health care bill "would make sweeping and deep cuts in the Medicaid program." http://abcn.ws/2tfyJkR  
Which is great but doesn't do Jack if you support & vote yes for a #HealthcareBill that kills #Medicaid which is the primary funding for tx
