You are a sell-out
I look forward to working tirelessly to see that you are not re-elected. Unfortunately I'm sure you'll do way more damage during your tenure
was M. Garland well qualified?  Be honest. You wouldn't vote for him because he was picked by a Democrat. Stop your hypocrisy
G-a-r-l-a-n-d
YOU SUCK!
I will not vote for you again!
I was looking forward to the even better qualified Merrick Garland confirmation, but #badsenators like you opted to go nuclear. #constituent
You are just the worst.
Can't support how your party has acted in filling Scalia's chair #stolenseat
Partisan politics is killing America.  Please have the courage to break ranks and do the right thing.  #NoGorsuch
You & #GOP played dirty & stole this nomination. There was so much dark money thrown at #GorsuchNomination  it disgusts me. My zip is 45153
I look forward to voting you out of office!
You stole the seat, it will be illegitimate for a generation!
#shameful You denied @POTUS44 #MerrickGarland #StolenSeat #DifferentRulesForGop #disgusted #disgusting
You are not listening to your constituents; just your donors.
I know you don't see the faces of the poor amd unemployed when u close ypur eyes. What do you see? Corporate logos and $$$$?
You're despicable in the way you got him in there. First delaying Merrick Garland and then the nuclear option. #unamerican #crook
You are just another of the lemmings, kissing DJT's a##. Grow a pair.
MERRICK GARLAND was "well-qualified! You hypocritical, shortsighted sellout! Maybe you can take a turn walking that thing on Trump's head.
Party before state, people and country. Who do you really represent?
Ugh
DO NOT CONFIRM GORCUCH! #NoGorsuch
Hypocrite.
Ohio voted for Trump and Portman by 20. Everyone can cry all you want. The majority of Ohians want Gorsuch
A steaming pile of horse manure would've beat Strickland worse. Trump 36% approval rating, under FBI investigation Ohio didn't want Gorsuch
How did you vote on Merrick Garland?  Can't seem to remember.
I specifically asked you not to do that.
But only because you cheated. A win isn't a win if you can take no pride in it or accept the accolades with humility.
Gorsuch is owned by corporate interests and  his confirmation will have long-lasting effects on generations of your #constituents. Sad!
You are wrong... I guess u also support military engagement in a battle that we will never win also #2018re-election
Shameful vote. The stature of the Senate was diminished today.
lol you're such a partisan toolbag
Can't wait for next election. Hope you have a day job
You should have a townhall at my union hall in Lorain so you could explain to all my laid off brother and sister why they arent making steel
With your record on environment, I mistook you for a good guy. I was wrong.
disappointed in your support of the nuclear option for the Sup Court pick.Hope you are able to explain this reckless move to your grandkids
You will forever be remembered as one of the fools who ruined the integrity of the Senate. Shame on you.  44811
After what happened to they need to remove the designation of distinguished Senator,  and replace it with the term Paracitic infestation.
You are on the wrong side of history, again.
Gorsuch only supports corporations and the rich. Just like you so no wonder you support him
Taking the nuclear route means you went for the win over the will of the people. That's not your job. #DoYourJob
terrible what you did to Garland #stolenseat Garland is also a qualified candidate but you ignored him #partyovercountry
Awful. Exec branch is inept & corrupt, so you weaken Leg & Jud branch. This is the only thing for which you'll be remembered.
You're a tool. Party line waste. Not listening to Americans screaming "bullshit!" at the top of our lungs. But we'll remember your part.
History and voters will not forget your part. Making yourself awful cozy with president whose approval rating is an embarrassment!
Judge Garland was extremely qualified and you wouldn't even consider his nomination. Shame on you.
The GOP continues to show a lack of foresight and an inability to do what is best for our country. We will remember your vote Rob.

If by supportting #Gorsuch, you mean the #NuclearOption, how dare you? If Gorsuch can't get enough votes, Trump must nominate someone else!
Change your mind. Gorsuch is corrupt and not for us.  #StopGorsuch
Weak. Embarrassing. Cheat. Look forward to your removal from Congress.
Can not wait to vote you out. If nothing else, you've given me that to look forward to.
Protecting corporate interest exceptionally well-qualified.Protecting the interests of the American people not really. How big is the check?
Since you vote party over country,  we'll be sure to vote you out.
The decisions you just made, show how screwed everyone is. YOU ALL should be thrown OUT!  and will!!!!
You republicans obviously only know how to change the rules to fit your agenda.  Bye Bye Portman.  You will be gone.
Rob, by NOT standing up and getting something done, you've created a tragic precedence for the balance of power, in US supreme courts
Judge Garland is exceptionally well-qualified and you should have looked forward to supporting his confirmation. Hypocrite.
Did he pay you too?
Setting aside all that the GOP did to steal this seat, he committed plagiarism. That alone should have disqualified him for SCOTUS.
HE. IS. A. PLAGIARIST. Are you kidding me????
You're a pos and do not represent the people of Ohio. Or America, for that matter.
will you please tell the other Ohio senator to man up and do the right thing for this exceptional judge?
As always, you just voted to put profits before people. You should be ashamed.
Way to break the system and traditions. You sold out your country and your constituents
Your vote to go #nuclear just nuked US Democracy. You thought OH voters were angry before...you ain't seen nothing yet. #VotePortmanOut
And we look forward to ousting as many Republicans as possible over the next few years.
Once again. Can you explain with a straight face why #MerrickGarland received NO CONSIDERATION? #allpolitics #shameless
You and your pal McConnell...disgustingly partisan. You have to live with yourself on denying Merick Garland and going nuclear.
If you vote for him I will not vote for you.
Unhappy constituent here. U helped obliterate filibuster 2 approve a nominee made by a pres under investigation 4 compromising US election.
2,042 until November 8, 2022
You do realize we are just adding this 2 your list of crimes against Ohioans, like voting to take away our internet privacy supporting DeVos
Fuck all the way off, rob portman
Of course you do, he is bought and paid for just like you.
u really are bought out man. You know this man isn't right for Supreme court. Folks like you need to be voted off the ballot. You suck.
And we look forward to voting you out!! can't get your way so you vote to change the rules. Bunch of crybabies hypocrites!!
.@senrobportman You cheated Garland out of a fair chance, you cheat Gorsuch into a stolen seat. #CheatersNeverProsper #Traitor
You went f/a moderate mediocre Senator to a #rubberstamp, extremist, money&power-driven traitor of your constituents. #WeWillReplaceYou
By changing the rules you have changed Congress for years to come.  All 100 of you need to work together, and listen to each other. Shameful
Merrick Garland was well qualified also & never got a chance.  Mitch McConnell should be horsewhipped, & you will never again get my vote.
Can't wait for all the GOP whining once the Dems get the Senate back. 
#Trumprussia
We won't forget your role in this shameful act by the GOP - 2022 you lose!
Of course you do - he's the same kind of business-loving, people-belittling politician you are. We need leaders who care about our citizens.
absolutely a devastating decision on your part, Mr. Portman.
And Merick Garland was well qualified, and SCOTUS should have Bi-Partisan support
I look forward to supporting the candidate who runs against YOU in the next election. You've failed Ohio & the US. #garland #resist
So disappointed in your partisanship, Rob.
Merrick Garland was exceptionally well-qualified too. Hypocrite.
History will show the truth $enator
Thanks for nothing. #ColumbusDissents #coward
Killer of American democracy - you should be ashamed!
You are truly awful. As is he. You've destroyed how the system is supposed to work. I hope you lose your seat next election.
Pruitt, DeVos, now changing the rules to let @SenMajLeader get his evil way.   You didn't even acknowledge ALL of the opposition to ur vote
you stole seat. Illegitimate justice. Never will be recognized by majority of Americans. Not his fault. Your hypocrisy.
You realize you just ended your political career, right?
Thank you, Mr Portman!
He's a bad guy.
I don't know who is worse about going on all the time about Gorsuch, you or Mitch Mcconnell.
Why him and Judge Garland couldn't get a vote.  We know the reason,  just admit it and I might respect you.
F-U There were other choices. Hope GOP never gets House again.
Say it again, Rob. I'm almost starting to believe you.
Shame on you, even my kids know that changing a rule to win is cheating. When's the town hall??
I say we visit him at his home or set-up camp outside of his office. He will not hide from us!
You look to blowing up our democracy with the nuclear option? Sad day for America.
Republicans will not always be the majority party. Have you considered that?
#FU
I will not be voting for your re-election.
November, 2018 can't come soon enough!!!
SOB just voted in. I'm pissed.
You guys really suck at your job. You just sent a message that it's fine to change the rules when it's too hard to do your job.
Strongly urging you against Gorsuch.  Corporations before people is not good for America.
is he giving that DPhil back though?
Why dont you say that crap to our faces at a #REALTownHallNOW??? #youreonbreak #SCHEDULETHETOWNHALL #wedisagree #stopignoringus #whodoyourep
You stole the nomination so single-issue voters would pull the lever for a Republican President.  Do you REALLY feel good about the result?
Yes he does because it was all about $ and winning, not what was best for our country! #partyovercountry
I hope GOP realizes what they just did. Rigged the system for a very unpopular prez at the worst possible time. Divisive, shortsighted. 
You must have no desire to be re-election do you?
You have helped deteriorate American Democracy. The country & Ohio deserve better. You don't even know enough to be ashamed.
That's too bad....I wonder who will be running against you in the next election???
Disappointed in your vote supporting a rule change from 60 votes. #Gorsuch puts corporations before people. Vote NO for #SCOTUS.
We want a townhall!  It doesn't seem that you care how Ohioans feel about issues you vote on.  #WhereIsPortman
That was Harry Reid.
If by "well qualified" you mean ultra conservative then you are spot on. Garland was well qualified.
Merrick Garland was eminently qualified, so where were you then? Your job is gone. Bye-bye!
Good job damaging our democracy #change the nomination not the rule. You are failing your state and country
It's sad you and GOP wouldn't even acknowledge Garland. We know the truth how you handled it, even though you try to paint a different pic.
I look forward to removing you from office.
You killed democracy. You were my last GOP vote. Ever. #taxfattenedjackasses
So was Merrick Garland. You're an embarrassment to Ohio.
And I look forward to voting you out of office for doing it!!
just a reminder that his term ends on January 3, 2023.  So while this promise is nice, its best not to put too much energy into this for now
Let's have a town hall Rob. Can't hide from us forever.
You've been corrupted by money & power & you've compromised the Senate, the SCOTUS, & yourself. #boohiss #nointegrityRob #rubberstampRob
You changed the senate forever because you couldn't get your way in stealing a SCOTUS seat. Shame on you!
Thank god russia helped get trump elected so you could vote for Gorsuch.
Do you support stealing to get your way?
