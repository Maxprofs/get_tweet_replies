@Usher  but not the #NBAFinals
SWEEP IS COMING! 
CAVS in 6.
6? More like 4
Repeat of last year's ECF
Well this isn't last year
CAVS will be tied coming back 2-2 and then blow them out at home. Trust me, we thought this last year!
you want me to trust somebody that I don't even know? lol
CAVS suck in Toronto's playoff environment
@cynn_cityyy
WE CANT BE STOPPED! Y'all playing a weak ass team
That will never happen Bro cuz we tooo raw! 3-1 don't forget that
I cant imagine what it's like to be so butthurt that the warriors are raw that people still bring this shit up 
Butthurt? Not at all. The warriors are a good team, but the cavs are just better 
I enjoy LeBron James as an actor more than a basketball player lol

Honestly, I'm just wanting a Spurs vs Cavs match up 
Spurs win easily in 5.
I can't make any bets, I honestly didn't think they would come back from a 3-1 deficit, but they did. But if the spurs win I won't be mad!
They match up well against the warriors, they don't vs the Spurs.
It's honestly because of Kawhi, and he'll have the throne next. I have so much respect for him and love watching him play!
@Osman-OD  $#OS nagga
