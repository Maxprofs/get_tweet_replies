You're disgusting.
I don't think any real Republicans can take you seriously anymore.  RINO.
Vote no for full healthcare repeal and no replacement. Your constituents need care not chaos. Thank you.
Better health care for all. This new bill is no better than the last.
So, don't vote to repeal.
Senator, you were not among the four that went against #Trumpcare I have lost all confidence in your ability to represent #Ohio bye in 2022
Opioid addiction didn't come up from the gutter, it came down from Wall Street. Shouldn't #BigPharma pay for rehab from their profits?
Seniors & vet's want u 2 step up 2 the plate & stop THIS STALLING on this & hundreds of things waiting 2 get pushed thru.4 GOD'S SAKE MAN
Reply from RN-ABSOLUTELY! Pls retweet
Portman is caving and betraying OH residents. Call and give him hell Ohioans.
Portman signals he may vote for the motion to proceed on health care. "I'm generally one who believes we should debate." Still undecided
Drug Dependence 
Please hold firm on the repeal vote. Americans are counting on you. Repeal without a good replacement will be catastrophic for our country.
The street version or prescribed version? Careful with stigmas.
Shame on you if you go along with this bribe. Medicaid will still be gutted.
Since you say your for it it probably means your against it. If you lied about repealing Obamacare what else are you lying about?
Fraud.
And, Senator, just a reminder, that since the bill isn't changing, you need to still just vote NO!
New CBO on latest repeal/replace GOP plan:

2018: 15 million more would be uninsured than ACA…
#IStandWithPresidentTrump I'm concerned about the seriously ill not getting pain medicine since abusers r stopping doctors from prescribing
I totally support you on this Senator Portman (hey, I'm not always crabbing at you). Thank you.
You need to go after the drug companies that are manufacturing that stuff within our own borders first- that's the bigger threat!
Fighting drugs is good!Dont let them bribe U  2accept  nonhealth tax bill.The Amer people R entitled 2 have #singlepayer or #FixACS like you
Put your age old pet projects aside.
Unwrap the flag of "pity" until you take care of the majority of Ohioans.
No TAX CUTS to unfund the ACA
Clearly it's very popular to blame drug companies and it wins elections but the US wont ever keep drugs out. Focus on mental health side.
Not all.of American are drug att.  But all Americans are effected by obama care repeal it republican need to do thier job REPEAL OBAMA CARE
Why the huge concern for drug addicts but not regular folks with medical problems ? @senrobportman
Rob Portman looks like the crooked politician on trial in every episode of Law & Order

The CBO just scored the latest Senate repeal bill.

17,000,000 Americans will lose coverage by NEXT YEAR.…
Throw more money and a another study commission at it That will solve problem. That always works
32 million more uninsured with TrumpCare won't help solve the opiod crisis.
Have a spine and vote no on this republican healthcare fiasco.
Every one of your constituents can see that you continue to ignore the obvious problem. #Trumpcare is ridiculous.
Enough is Enough! Work with Dems to fix ACA. New CBO score is devastating for kids, seniors, disabled, sick, poor, and woman. This is cruel!
Ohioans are counting on you to stay strong & vote NO against bringing vote to repeal ACA to floor. Need bipartisan repair-work together!
You must act on #RepealObamacare Keep your promise or lose your seat!
Check out the hashtag #CBOSCORE and see how much of a monster you will be if you cave under pressure and vote yes.
Time for you to support our President. Ohioans voted for Trump and you so make our vote count. Repeal Obamacare now!!
How?  What's your plan?
Repeal only: "In CBO & JCT’s est, under this legislation, about 1/2 of nation’s population would live in areas having no [nongroup] insurer"
McConnell leadership is self centered and is dooming your party. He will take his supprtrs down including you. Wake up please
I wonder if this position will change like your position did on Obamacare? Coward!  #Primarythegop
You're a disappointment and not a man of your word.
on and on about opioid use important yes but not committing to openly apposing McConnell call for ACA repeal. SHAMEFUL.
if it was legal, it could be regulated & taxed
but, nooooooo.......
32 million. That how many people would lose their ins. if u repeal and do nothing. People not party vote NO. 7yrs of repeal talk and no plan
It's called free market...what we had before Obamacare was inflicted upon us. Keep government out of our healthcare!
I was able to find fairly good insurance that I could afford .I have always had insurance. Some are not that lucky.We need to take of them
The Senate must act now to repeal Obamacare
Its official, CBO states that rob Portman's replace and forget would lead to 32 million without healthcare. Might as well use that fentanyl.
When u go to your mtg tonight remember these kids.  No to Pre-existing clauses, lifetime caps.  Remember these beautiful souls, minds & 'a
Tweetaide, you really need some new material.
Trump voters hear you are really a DEMOCRAT... you'll forever be remembered as an embarasment to our party. I hope you're destroyed in 2018
You've taken money from big pharma

Unrelated, but how do you explain this attack on free speech?
Get off your soap box and do something. Doesn't the Obamacare repeal address this. RINO!
Still not addressing the root issue of doctors overprescribing pain killers that lead to drug addictions? You get paid by the pharma lobby.
Vote no on MTP and no on trumpcare
Too bad #TrumpCare will strip funding for helping this.

Police Chief Probst (Star City): Medicaid cuts will force West Virginians to wait for opioid treatment. “That’s not going to help anybody” 

THE WORLD IS WATCHING! YOU ARE FAILING YOUR CONSTITUENTS, @senrobportman !

We find no evidence of the individual market collapsing. Rather, insurers on track to have best year since ACA began http://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/individual-insurance-market-performance-in-early-2017/ …
