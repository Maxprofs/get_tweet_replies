Thank you for your compassion for the vulnerable — we need good bipartisan healthcare, not bad bills rammed thru. Please vote NO on GraCas!
So you are going to vote "no" for the new health care bill so people with PTSD from rape and trafficking can get treatment, right?
I agree. But they also deserve quality affordable healthcare, so please do not support this inhumane bill.
One-Trick pony Portman. Discuss anything but biggest issue before the senate. Should be primaried next year
They also deserve good health insurance #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
Stop diverting. You're not fooling anyone. Be transparent. How do you intend to vote on Cassidy-Graham? You've been a coward on each vote
man up, grow a set and stop hiding and hoping this never hits the floor. Either way, state your position. We deserve it!!!!
You don't seem to have the necessary minimum bandwidth to be a senator. You only talk about two things--sex and drugs. Multitask, prioritize
Ohioans deserve health insurance. #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
Would be great if you took as much interest in the crazy ACA repeal effort as you do human trafficking. You need to vote no next week.

They also deserve good universal healthcare.  Which #GrahamCassidy is not. Please vote no.
Of course they deserve justice. Do they also deserve access to affordable health insurance?
Vote NO on the bad Graham-Cassidy bill. Do not take away health care from Ohioans who need it. Stand up and vote NO.
This is another attempt to censor things disguised as a moral law, isn't it?
Hell hath no fury like the AARP scorned...  don't hurt our seniors!
Absolutely amazes me that you have not referenced your stance on the healthcare bill.
Rob-right now Senators are staking their claim to a side of history. Do you stand with people or party; compassion or cruelty?
Oh please. How is it compassionate to keep the poor poor? That's what Medicaid and welfare do. It's a trap that the poor can't risk to leave
Citizens deserve justice w/healthcare as well. #GrahamCassidy has been rejected by Med. profs., insurers, & patient advocates. #KillTheBill
All Americans don't deserve the cruelty of #GrahamCassidy, which is esp bad for women. Look up from your bill to see what the GOP is doing.
Thank you @senrobportman for staying focused on a topic that impacts ALL Americans. We MUST END #humantrafficking #slavery #AllLivesMatter
They'll also need health care they can afford. Don't take that away from them, Senator. Vote no on #GrahamCassidy
Called your office today to register my opposition to graham-Cassidy. Please stop and think about our state. VOTE NO. McCain gave you a pass

Healthcare: Where do you stand? No to #GrahamCasiddy
Do they also deserve health care? Or is that too much to ask? Vote no on #ObamacareRepeal or Ohio will vote no for you.
If you cant stand up to protect the most vulnerable in OH then you have no business calling yourself a United States Senator! #CassidyGraham
Why is the bill taking so long?  Who is holding up the sex slavery bill? Name names
Victims of GOP #gopkills
It is great you are passionate about human trafficking, but we need you to vote YES on Graham-Cassidy
Yes, human trafficking is a problem, so is healthcare 4 all. If you really care for those addicted to opioids, you'll vote NO on Trumpcare!
They probably need healthcare too. #voteno
Kasich for his seat in 2018, we need to dump this coward.
They also deserve affordable healthcare. As do all your constituents.  Vote NO on GrahamCassidy.
Please listen to your constituents.  Vote No on #GrahamCassidy.  Protect those who need it most.  #43230
Come on Rob,  do what is right. Vote against this healthcare option. It’s time to show us you care for the people of Ohio.
We get it!  What about Graham Cassidy?  Yes or no?
Justice will come to the people HURT or CRUSHED by GRAHAM-CARE...
ELECTION KARMA
Vote No on #GrahamCassidy . Do it. Just do it.
What about students sexually assaulted on campus? Now no legal assistance #StopBetsy #Stop and no access to healthcare #VoteNoTrumpcare
Behind New Obamacare Repeal Vote: ‘Furious’ G.O.P. Donors - The New York Times
Your constituents will be even more FURIOUS w/you if you take away their healthcare. All the donor  in the  won't help you change that.

Every major health organization, or Donald Trump? This bill isn't dead yet. Tell your senators which side you're on: (855) 999-1663 
How come this seems to be the only topic you are concerned about?   Let's talk healthcare. 
How are you going to vote on Graham-Cassidy???
Literally nobody is talking about this.. if you throw people off Healthcare they could be a victim of human trafficking! Come on man
Do you listen to Ohioans like Toby Cosgove at CLE Clinic?  No on #GrahamCasiddy Senator.
And 32 million Americans do not deserve to lose their health insurance - Vote NO on the #NOonGrahamCassidy

I cannot in good conscience vote for Graham-Cassidy. A bill impacting so many lives deserves a bipartisan approach. http://bit.ly/2xtEuvz  
And all Americans deserve access to affordable high quality healthcare. Vote NO on #GrahamCasiddy .
Will you work to get them healthcare? #bipartisan
@SenJohnMcCain represents the people and best interests of our country. He's protecting the US from the #GrahamCassidyDeathBill. Will you?
They deserve proper after-care and your unstated support of #GrahamCassidy would prevent them from getting that!
But not affordable medical care to help them heal?
Constituents deserve to know where their Senator stands.

Should we have healthcare or not?

#NoGrahamCassidy
#DontRobOurCare
#whereyouatRob
Vote NO on the health care bill !!
How can you represent Ohio if you won't even address #GrahamCassidy per your constituents CONTINUED requests? Vote No.
Dammit, Portman. Tell your bot that we are grateful you are helping sex trafficking victims, but stand up against Graham-Cassidy. #WheresRob
He's not helping sex trafficking victims.. sex trafficking is a financial epidemic and people are driven into it because of debt problems
If you truly care about Ohioans you will vote no on the Graham-Cassidy bill.
Grateful to Senator McCain for doing the right thing when the rest of you won't.
Every two hours, you are posting about human trafficking. That is a great thing to stop, but healthcare? Please vote no - for Ohioans.
Ohioans deserve healthcare, vote NO on #GrahamCassidyBill
American victims of GOP attempts to steal their healthcare deserve justice too. My bet is you're too much of a coward to vote against theft.
If only you put this much dedication into the healthcare debate. Right now you appear to not care about that at all.

Big: GOP Senator Susan Collins confirms Graham-Cassidy would gut protections for pre-existing conditions:

http://www.pressherald.com/2017/09/22/collins-says-shes-leaning-against-voting-for-graham-cassidy-health-care-bill/ … 
This is good and necessary work.
Why can't you have a backbone like John McCain. I know that you were just re-elected but we will not forget. COWARD
It is time to keep your promise to protect Medicaid expansion, and oppose Graham-Cassidy!  Vote no!
How much do you pay your pr interns to read the comments on your tweets and do they share them with you?
As do citizens who need healthcare. VOTE NO on Graham-Cassidy
Hey Rob, @SenJohnMcCain is a no vote on #CassidyGraham so now you can have an opinion.
#CowardlyPortman #WheresRob
Yes, they deserve justice, indeed. They also deserve good, affordable health care, too: Say NO on Graham-Cassidy.
Right now we're more concerned with healthcare.
Do you have the balls to vote against the GOP "make America sick" healthcare bill? As @SenJohnMcCain said "it's the RIGHT thing to do".
1,060.
John covered you, so you can keep hiding in a corner of your office. Tgif!
If you cared about victims of trafficking you would want them to have good healthcare
#CowardlyPortman #WheresRob
Please follow Senator McCain's  lead today! VOTE NO!!
#CowardlyPortman #WheresRob
Hey, I share the concerns. I'm also concerned about the #GrahamCassidyBill. Now show Ohio you support us by voting NO on this #bill
#CowardlyPortman #WheresRob
Ohioans deserve healthcare without lifetime caps.

VOTE NO ON GRAHAM CASSIDY!!
Senator Portman, its past time you come out to oppose Graham Cassidy.
#onetrickpony
Rob Portman where is REPEAL & REPLACE OBAMACARE? You are a LIAR! This Ohio voter WILL VOTE YOU OUT!
So, you don't give a crap about preexisitng conditions and Medicaid? Please, move out of Ohio.
So you just gonna wait till #GrahamCassidy fails before you come out against it, or just pretend like everyone doesn't hate you and say yes?
Victims of your politics deserve justice.
