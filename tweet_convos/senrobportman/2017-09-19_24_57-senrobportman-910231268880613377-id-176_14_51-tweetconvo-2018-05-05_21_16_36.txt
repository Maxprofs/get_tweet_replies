Agreed. But evidently bipartisanship is not so important when you're taking away people's health care? Don't repeal the ACA.
And congress should come together in a bipartisan way to fix healthcare #GrahamCassidyBill @HouseCallsAHCA

I've read every reply to this tweet.  No one is rooting for you to vote yes on the ACA repeal. Please show us that you care about Ohio.
My dream is to have great #healthcare! Are you going to protect us or give your money men what they want?
How about coming together in a bipartisan way to fix and not destroy the ACA?
Or use that money for tax cuts for the wealthy you support, or for the republican health care bill that dooms most Ohioans
You Could Also Come together to  FIX ACA Not Trying 2 Give us #DEATHCARE #VoteNOGrahamCassidy  #LindseyGrahamsATraitor #ProtectOurCare
Congress should support Trump on his healthcare agenda, obstructionist like Rand Paul and Elizabeth Warren are not needed now
Congress should come together in a bipartisan way to save healthcare-vote NO on Graham-Cassidy!!
Know what else Congress should do? Stop trying to take away Americans' healthcare. #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
Let's also work together on fixing the #ACA and voting #noGrahamCassidy. Medicaid is essential in the fight against opiates.
if you care anything about Ohio you will change Obumacare now, idc really how you change it all I know is I have no doctor.
G-C health bill is terrible for Ohio because it eliminates the Medicaid expansion and transfers money from OH to states that did not.
Why cant you have a bipartisan plan for healthcare.  VOTE NO on #GrahamCassidy
They should also come together in a bipartisan way to fix the ACA. Vote NO on Graham-Cassidy bill. #NORepeal #ProtectOurCare

Congress should come together in a bipartisan way to protect/fix the ACA #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
If you vote to increase my insurance cost, just go away.  Most retirees can't stand another $6,000 added to their ins. cost.
what bipartisanship you just took part in partisan politics against Ohioans with preexisting conds and Medicaid, bipartisan?
If you are calling for bipartisan cooperation on this, why not on healthcare?  What's the rush?
Congress should come together to #improvehealthcare, not cut it!! #regularorder #bipartisan #ProtectOurCare

People with pre-existing conditions, pregnant women among those who lose out in GOP's latest health care bill. http://apne.ws/iP7et7Z 
Congress should come together in a bipartisan way for healthcare. Republicans are ramming a disastrous bill down the throats of Americans!
I don't understand why you are talking about everything except healthcare. Please stand up for me and other Ohioans and vote no.
Obumacare is killing thousands of Americans everyday, why is it so hard to just get rid of it? Stand behind our POTUS now
Spineless! Will not even address healthcare!

Under this bill, pregnancy will cost you an extra 17K. Metastatic cancer 172K. Autism 5K. Asthma 4K. This isn't a healthcare bill.

NEW: What AARP thinks of Graham Cassidy.

Not much. 
Also should come together to reform ACA. Where is your statement on healthcare for our most vulnerable?
@senrobportman Repeal & Replace Obamacare!! End Daca! American CITIZENS comes 1st!!! My LEGAL kids MATTER!!!
#RepealAndReplaceObamaCare !!!!
Don't Kill Kids Bob! Cancer patients will face a nightmare scenario if Trumpcare becomes law.
you should also help students keep their healthcare.
Maybe you should also come together in a bipartisan way to fix health care. Did you know #GrahamCassidy contains ZERO money for opioids?

GOP won't allow bipartisan option.  Killed it.   Also no more protections for these services.
Graham-Cassidy allows insurers to NOT cover:
-Pregnancy
-Newborn care
-Mental health services…
Help students , protect our healthcare #KillTheBill #GrahamCasiddy
Wow the fog is so thick from your hypocrisy. Should include #ACA bipartisan way to stabilize healthcare markets. Sad!
Students need healthcare. Work bipartisan to vote NO #GrahamCassidy
#VOTENOROB
The Perkins loan means nothing as long as DeVos is doing everything she can make schools unaffordable while not giving a care about students
Congress should come together to reject #GrahamCassidy
What about bipartisan healthcare? Vote NO on #GrahamCassidy
Congress should also come together to discuss Graham Cassidy instead of forcing it through . Pls don't vote yes; debate and evaluate first
And in a bipartisan way to fix the #aca not the very partisan and sneaky way that is happening right now.
Leave my health care alone!!!
Why not a "bipartisan way" for healthcare? Give it time and do it right. No on #GrahamCassidy
How about coming together in a bipartisan way to prevent millions from losing their access to healthcare?
This is such BS.  GRAHAM-CASSIDY is nothing but politics.  If it passes, people will die.
Please vote NO on Graham Cassidy #noGrahamCassidy
Just another look over there tweet so you can avoid talking about healthcare. Not working. Your constituents want to #saveACA
The Perkins is already dead in the water. Healthcare is being threatened again. Speak out against #GrahamCassidyBill #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
Congress should also come together in a bipartisan way to craft a healthcare solution. Listen to our governor and vote No on Graham-Cassidy.
and what about a bipartisan approach to healthcare? Many Ohioans depend on the ACA. Vote no on #GrahamCassidy.
Hey, talk to DeVos.  She has no idea what's she's doing and doesn't listen to others.  You both will get along well!

Why is it you want to protect steel & a paltry college loan, but not healthcare?
Man up and do your job!
The ACA allows students to stay on their parent's insurance. Graham Cassidy will scar them with preexisting conditions
Good start... Funding Pell Grants and taking off lifetime caps would help too.  Again let's chat
Are you going to be true to your constituents and vote no on Graham Cassidy? As if you haven't been getting calls against it all day
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lo2xCUXmRWO0e8ftto5zqzkGHusgih0IfdpyGBaCfew/htmlview … healthcare first

I hope that would include the Dreamers #saveDACA
To date, not one major health care industry or advocacy group has  expressed support for the Graham-Cassidy plan. #noGrahamCassidy
Just go away already! Those kids were old enough 2 kn what they paid $ 4 & took classes 4...why sh we fix their idiot choices? Yr a waste!
You need to help us in Ohio with healthcare!
Are you too much of a coward to do the right thing with health care? You presented yourself a leader before the election, not a follower.
Medicare for all
You need to stand up for disabled and those with pre existing conditions
Speaking of bipartisan...work to make a fix for #ACA and vote NO on #GrahamCassidyBill 
Bipartisan works with more than one agenda. Try it.
Is that before or after they vote to kill millions of Americans?
Join @JohnKasich and Support a bipartisan fix to healthcare!  Not this catastrophe of a law that the Graham-Cassidy bill is.
Your vote for Devos suggests you think otherwise. I wish we knew where you stand on all these issues.
AND YOU SHOULD VOTE NO ON GRAHAM CASSIDY!  OHIO IS WATCHING!
Great. And you should NOT support the Graham-Cassidy bill. Ohioans are watching you and your vote, Senator.
I'll bet students need healthcare.
And, congress should come together and vote AGAINST the new version of trumpcare.
You keep preaching bipartisanship.  I hope you're doing the same for healthcare. Cassidy-Graham is a bad bill.
Congress needs to come together to FIX the ACA!!!!! Design a new program in a bipartisan matter...listen to @JohnKasich for God's sakes!!!
Now the chance to come to a bi partisan agreement to help the ACA is  dead. As will be many, many of your constituents if this bill passes
EVERY THING SHOULD BE DONE THAT WAY! #noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy
Why are you not tweeting about health insurance? You know that's what we're all thinking about. Please vote no.
Like the bipartisanship you're showing on the #GrahamCassidyBill. Its time to #KillTheBill.
Congress should come together in a bipartisan way to give health care to all Americans.
Congress should come together in a bipartisan way to at least hold hearings, debate, and get a CBO score, before another attempt to gut ACA.
Yes, & help us not drown in student debt overall... and most relevant right now - to stand up loudly against the #GrahamCassidyBill !
How about health care?  Legit health care, I mean.
Save Medicaid!!
Vote no on Graham-Cassidy.
Rob Portman, always with his finger on the pulse of Ohio. 

No one cares about healthcare anyway.
Probably wouldn't hurt to give us some of those super low interest rates Wall Street and the Auto Industry received either.
It would also be great if we could stabilize the ACA markets with bipartisan efforts rather than risking the insurance of millions via GCH
@GOP #VoteNOGrahamCassidy #badbill will cut access to affordable healthcare for millions
The senate should come together to fix the ACA, rather than repealing it in trade for tax cuts.

#Childrenshospitals support @curesearch @accorg during #ChildhoodCancerAwarenessMonth.Check out Kaylyn’s story  http://bit.ly/2hcZRf2  
3/ two more words: management salaries
2/ then do the same for healthcare! Others do it why can't USA? Two words: profit margins
1/ How about this: make college free or low cost  like other countries.
How about you talk to DeVos and tell her not to end public servant loan forgiveness while you're at it?
Please vote NO! on Graham-Cassidy Healthcare. Redeem yourself Senator.

Please can we talk about the new healthcare bill with only 90 sec of debate allowed.  Changes 1/6th of the economy!
How about healthcare? Why won't you work bipartisanly on that?
THIS JUST IN: save our healthcare.
Yes to bipartisan efforts.  Gov. Kasich agrees re: health care.  Please follow his lead and #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
The Republican Russian Party has lost their way. Sold out our country for GREED. It's your party who cut these programs.
Just so you know, we are reading your tweets like, "La la la not about ACA la la la," and we are super angry at you.
All student loans should be interest free

Hard to do when they're dead! Vote no on Graham- Cassidy. Save Ohio lives so they can go to school!
Yet you voted against helping students with the loan refinancing act in 2014, and logic says you'll do it again this time around.
So which one is it? And where's the true bipartisan health care fix we've been hearing about? Cuz #GrahamCassidy is not that.
We also need a bipartisan fix to healthcare. Please stand with @JohnKasich and oppose the #GrahamCassidyBill
Trump wants the Cassidy-Graham health bill. So of course you're for it. Party before country, always.
shameful that we Ohioans are left in the dark by our senator.
Vote NO on Trumpcare!!
MEDICAID. Please, empty your mailboxes so you can hear from YOUR people.
Congress should come together in bipartisan way to develop healthcare bill too. Don't you agree?
Really?  You could start by getting Betsy DeVos to pay her debt to OH.  Or maybe there's a reason you don't.  51,000 of them.
Congress should come together in bipartisan way to rid our nation of the reckless dangerous&unhinged madman in WH pushing us to nuclear war
So it's basically "Talk about anything but Healthcare" with you?
And apparently he wants to keep his voicemail full so we can't call.
Congress should come together in bipartisan way to extend TRUE HEALTHCARE for all Americans at least as good as you have as a senator! SHAME
Quit bragging about all of your bipartisan efforts. Use it where it is most needed... Our healthcare.  Do the hard work!
Rob, take a break from your usual topics, read the health care bill and let us know you'll be voting no.
He can't because he won't vote yes. You know he never listens to his constituents and why would he? You're not paying him.
We're all watching your vote on #GrahamCassidy. Show us that you're a man of character.  Don't hurt thousands of Ohioans.
I gave up on "man of character" when he voted for @BetsyDeVosED... He won't talk to us unless we are BIG donors, addicted or trafficked.
Haven't there been talks as well to forgive student loans for those that have been employed and already paid a considerable amount?#Needed
We also need a bipartisan solution to protect our healthcare. #GrahamCassidy is definitely not the answer.
Bipartisan Governor group announces opposition to Graham-Cassidy. Notable new addition: Alaska Gov. Bill Walker 
Congress should come together in bipartisan way to pass Dreamers Act, Fix ACA, protect LGBT military, #stopGrahamCassidy plan
Congress should come together and vote NO on the new #GrahamCassidy bill. It's bad for Ohio and bad for our country.
Please devote your attention to halting the repeal of the ACA. You are respected voice in the Senate. Use your power with compassion.
Too bad it won't matter since millions will die without the #ACA and not be able to take advantage of it, or is that your plan?

Our @will_c_fischer says #GrahamCassidy is just #TrumpCare with a new name and still takes health care away from thousands of #veterans. 
There Dreams party party party. That is why we have lots of fun in school.
That is why we have taxes after taxes aftertaxes on top of taxes and on top of taxes and more taxesFollow thedollar Money talks and Bullshit
Oh, NOW you want bipartisanship? Gee, hearings and markups, too?
Stop using the word bipartisan. Your complicit participation in Graham Cassidy is a a #democracydeathSpiral Embarrassed to be American today
and pell grants
Here we r again. .@senrobportman getting ready to vote 30M people and it of their healthcare
1,057.
As well as a bipartisan way to help the ACA thrive instead of killing it. You should lead the way on that bipartisan legislation.
Mitch killed the bipartisan effort between @SenAlexander & @SenatorCollins today.  Ohio, your Senator is letting you down - bigly.
He's a terrible senator who has his priorities set on pleasing Mr. Trump and his Russians ways. He'll suckle the Rep way as best as possible
So they can die when they get sick? You're a real class act Portman.
Quit the pivots. What about health care?
Ohio worst in US for student debt & our gov't is GOP. Rob votes against students, for millionaires:
And they should come together in bipartisan way to address REAL issues with current ACA legislation.  Not the current ham-fisted GOP way.
Stand with the Citizens of Ohio and veto the proposed changes to the ACA as per the Graham act.
Maybe you could come up with some kind of #TrumpCare loan so that Ohioans could go deep in debt for health care expenses?
How about a bipartisan solution to fix the ACA markets????
