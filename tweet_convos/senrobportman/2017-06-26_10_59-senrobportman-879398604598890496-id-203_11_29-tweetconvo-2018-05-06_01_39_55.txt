@senrobportman  You should have publicly stated you will not support this bill. It is not good for OH or anyone else!  VOTE NO!
If you're concerned, then you should vote NO. Why is this difficult? Your rich donors really have a hold on you.
Senator - please remember when you vote: without Medicaid, more people die & more continue a life of crime to feed their opioid addiction.
"Concerns" is a cop out. Come out and oppose this HC bill @senrobportman!
It will devastate #Ohio and worsen the opioid crisis. #Bad4Ohio
Dear Rob Portman,
You're part of the Gang of 13 who drafted this #HealthcareBill GOP=Greed Over People 
#CBOReport

The Senate bill is horrible.  We need to fix the ACA, not destroy it and substitute something worse.  Please vote NO.
Looking forward to your town hall where you can talk to your constituents about it as well. When will that be?
Please do not support a bill that puts vulnerable people at risk, this affects my son and husband. We need protections & we r counting on u
Vote no!
Where is your no vote? Susan Collins stepped up its your turn.
What is your stance now that the @USCBO has released it's report on #BRCA ???
Big deal u will still stand in line behind yr Prez n party B4 u ever stand 4 Americans
Vote No. This bill does not support those who suffer from opioid addictions. Do not cave into Mitch McConnells political tactics.
You seem like a nice man. But we need more than that now. We need a man with courage. Stand up for us.  
Vote no on the AHCA.
He is not nice. He is smooth, he is charming. Not nice.
He is also in the pockets of his rich donors like DeVos, doesn't seem to care only 16% approve of wicked #AHCA
Although a few things about this bill are better there is a huge amount that is wrong on so many levels. Do the right thing Senator Vote NO
The unraveling of Medicaid in this shameful bill is disturbing - please DO NOT vote in the affirmative - vote your conscience, lives matter.
#HealthcareBill will cut #Medicaid which 2/3 people in nursing homes use to pay; wd devastate middle class to lose it; rips our safety net
Please please please vote NO on AHCA!!!!
Please VOTE NO on this Healthcare Bill. Taking away coverage and the lack of affordable coverage will kill millions of innocent Americans.
My TN senators care more about getting rid of Obamacare than the implications of $800 billion lost for Medicaid. #VoteNoACHA
please vote against trumpcare and work towards finding a better replacement instead
We as your constituents are urging you to vote no, and appreciate your support.
1 question. What healthcare problem in America is made BETTER by #GOPcare ? I'll wait. 

#TuesdayThoughts Will GOP #VoteNo #GOPDeathCare
Vote no even when you are offered money to vote yes (as you have without exception in the past).
#HealthcareBill Appreciate your Medicaid protection efforts, too many Ohio families and seniors in nursing home need it to survive.
Hopefully Senator Portman can feel the way the wind is blowing. This bill is foundering. Don't go down with it.
Should do far more than "concern" you. Vote NO on #TrumpCare it's a #wealthcarebill that has real life consequences. Lives hang in balance.
#HealthcareBill will even hurt people w employer-based insurance b/c lifetime limits, no essential benefit requirements, no employer mandate
All this bill does is take money from healthcare to give to the rich.   The people that die as a result of this bill will haunt you forever.
Will vote NO on #takecareaway bill?
Please VOTE NO on this deadly bill, your vote is for ALL Americans, 22 mil who will lose insurance,incl 7 mil vets.
This bill will hurt Ohio. Hospitals will close causing job loss. People will not seek treatment til  illnesses are critical costing more
.@senrobportman -- hopefully you are more than merely "concerned" after reading the CBO report. Please follow example of @SenatorCollins!
As one of your constituents, I stand with the majority who demand you vote NO!  
#Bad4Ohio
#ProtectOurCare
This bill should be ringing alarm bells, not just 'concerns.' I urge you to vote NO and stand up for Ohioans.
Vote no!
Vote NO! Your constituents are paying close attention that you've had no townhalls to discuss it w/us.  You represent US! So, protect US!
A lot of what you said was double talk.  I'm concerned for the people in nursing homes who will have no one to take care of them.
Please vote no on the AHCA. It is immoral to slash Medicaid funding. I've been trying to call all day and can't get through. Please vote no.
Please move from concerned to committed against this egregious bill!! #ProtectOurCare #SaveMedicaid #StopBCRA
Vote no vote no vote no vote no vote no vote no vote no vote no Vote no vote no vote no vote no vote no vote no vote no vote no vote 
Calling all OH constituents!! Let's tell our senator if we support TrumpCare. All those in favor say *for*; All those opposed say *against*
Completely and utterly Against
I don't want to live in a country or state that doesn't take responsibility to humanely care for it's most vulnerable.
Disgusting video reveals a total lack of empathy & passion 4 freedom & lives 2 B lost that so-called "concern" communicates! Care? Vote NO!
I'm glad you're concerned. I'm moving to Ohio soon and my vote depends on you voting no on AHCA. Cutting coverage is anti-life.
An Obamacare fix requires controlling medical costs-not depriving 23 million of healthcare and ending essential benefit coverage. VOTE NO.
22 million Americans will lose coverage. The most vulnerable will suffer: children, poor, elderly, pregnant women. Vote NO.
Fraud.
Then VOTE NO! Listen to your voters, doing the right thing for the American people should not be that hard!!!

#midterms2018 #HealthcareBill
vote no!  heller and Collins give you cover!
vote no!!  It's a mess for Ohio.
Will you please vote against this terrible bill?
Then what happens? My medical bills will run at least $18,000 a month to keep cancer at bay. I would like to stay alive. Vote NO on TrumpCae
Please do not vote for TrumpCare. I have stage 4 Breast cancer and I still work in order to have insurance. Soon I won't be able to
PREZ WANTS YOU TO SUPPORT HEALTHCARE BILL. AFRAID IT PASSES MILLIONS OF HIS SUPPORTERS & THEIR FAMILIES WILL LOSE INSURANCE & DIE!!
I am going to guess those Medicaid changes don't concern you nearly as much as they do me. #SaveMedicaid #SaveOurCare #NoTrumpCare
Vote NO! If for no other reason than your own career. You will never get re-elected if you pass this. Never.
Ohio can't survive #HealthCareBill Don't think Republican team. Don't think political power. Think decent human and kill this bill.
So vote NO! Do more than say you are concerned. Kill this bad Republican bill. Preserve the Affordable Care Act.
Try getting outraged by it like those of us who will be affected by it are!! Life and death issues should get more than your "concern"
Now that it's out there, please vote NO on the senate bill. #SaveMedicaid #socialworkersformedicaid
Please weed out the freeloaders. I have a 5000.00 deductible and pay for these entitlements. Otherwise, I want to be #Entitled #MAGA
Be MORE than concerned. People will die. The opioid crisis will get worse. Middle and lower class Americans will pay more. VOTE NO.
Please vote no on this disastrous bill. 22 million more uninsured with no decrease in rates. Not what is best for addicts, kids, or vets.
22 million losing healthcare is a "concern"? Where's your heart! It's appalling!

Based on the CBO report, how can you, in good conscience, vote for this atrocity? Please vote no and insist on taking time to get it right.
The AMA is also "concerned". Vote NO
You know you should vote no, don't cave. We are watching you.
my dude: what if i told you that you are in the position to act in this concern
CBO on Senate bill: "insurance would pay smaller share of benefits; most people would have higher out-of-pocket spending than current law"
CBO says that by 2019 you're gonna have the same problem that this bill is supposed to solve: areas where no insurer is in non-group market
Are you a GOP conservative or liberal? CBO score counts people that voluntarily opt out & don't meet Obama care min. Get HC done now!2018!
Please vote NO on the AHCA.  Stand up for the American people.  #NoAHCA
"You can't always get what you wa-ant."
Hurts:
women
children
elderly
disabled
addicted
poor
sick
families
opioid fight
hospitals
HC workers
Ohio
your employment unless u oppose it
Then vote no.  22 Million will lose healthcare according to the CBO.  Bad bill, Work for a better one #HealthcareBill
PLEASE do not vote for this!! Ohioans need all the help they can get to stay healthy. Do not condemn the most vulnerable among us to death!
Put the people of Ohio that will be devastated by a "yes" vote ahead of the GOP's dream of repeal and replace of ACA.
Please vote no on this disastrous healthcare bill. It hurts people who need it the most. Work with Obamacare and fox the kinks.
#VoteNoBCRA
Medicaid covered 70% of the $939 mil that State of Ohio spent on opioid crisis.Republicans in the Senate wants to gut Medicaid. Who will pay
So is THIS what you were hiding? I now understand why you drafted this in secret.
Jesus man, you guys really are literally legislating death. It's like the movie Soylent Green only death comes by denying healthcare.
CBO says 22 million will lose coverage with this. You must vote NO!
Time to vote u out in 2022
My 6-year-old son has asthma. I have many pre-existing conditions.  Don't take away our protection!
"Concern"???? Think we need representatives for Ohio that DO NOT KILL US WITH TRUMPCARE. Republicans need to GO.
#YouHaveThePowerToSaveUs #VoteNoAHCA #TaxCutNotHealthCare #peoplewillDie  #help #findFundsNegotiateDrugPrices #RegulatePharma
Glad it concerns you! Please DO NOT support this #HealthcareBill
Does it "concern" you that nearly 100% of replies to your tweets say vote NO? That AARP says NO? That all major medical associations say NO?
Trumpcare breaks every promise made to Americans about healthcare
Didn't you help draft this turd?
So bottom line: Tell is if you are voting for it or not. We in Ohio say NO.
It "concerns" you? Do something about it. Vote NO.
Please, please do not vote in favor of this atrocity of a health"care" bill. If you do, your vote could kill me. I have a chronic illness.
Vote NO!! We need the protections that the ACA has in place. Let's work on strengthening the framework we have in place! No to BCRA!
This bill is detrimental to the majority of Ohioans. Please put party aside and do what is best for your constituents.
Vote no.  #bad4ohio #killthebill
To sum it up: IT SUCKS!  VOTE NO! REPRESENT OHIO...WE DON'T WANT IT!
Establish yourself as a Senate leader, demonstrate common sense & common decency, and do what is right for Ohioans & Americans by voting No
Koch Brothers commit 400 million toward 2018 elections.  Is Sen Portman with us, or with them?  We are about to see.  Vote NO on Wealthcare.
By all means don't worry about the $20 Trillion debt!!  That's fine just keep spending and don't worry about it!!  SMH!  Politicians suck!
actually medicaid in Ohio has lots to do with the ACA. 700k got covered via Medicaid expansion and are better off
If the problem is insurance companies pulling out of the market bc they canâ€™t make a profit of its customers, why not move to single payer?
This bill is #BadForOhio. Protect access to healthcare for Ohioans! Cutting Medicaid isn't good for Ohio.
Senator Portman, please vote no on Trump care. OH would suffer. 45373
Vote no on this or I'll vote, campaign and donate to the other candidate, when reelection comes around
This isn't a healthcare bill. It is a tax cut for the top 1%.
Murderer
Vote NO on this bill!! I am embarrassed to be an American. Dragging disable people out of your building was a new low!!
Medicaid changes should really worry you; many of your constituents would not survive without Medicaid!
American Medical Association came out against the Senate draft.  Vote NO!
This means that if you lose coverage for just one month, you have to wait six months before you can get it back.
Then please don't support the cuts. My husband is in the early stages of dementia & the new changes scare me to death. Please don't support.
Missed the part where you mentioned the $382,100 you got to write such a heinous, mean spirited bill.
You know the AHCA will eventually gut Medicaid and uninsure millions. It's already unacceptable. Vote NO.
So glad the cuts to Medicaid concern you. Now are you going to vpte on that concern for your constituents or bend over for party leaders?
YOU MUST VOTE NO!!! Return of pre-existing condition denials/unaffordable costs should never return to this country. Never.
More talking to NOT YOUR CONSTITUENTS. Have a #REALTownHallNOW @senrobportman. And for Ohio's sake, VOTE NO ON THE BCRA.
#StandWithOhio
Imagine trying to explain to a European that your child's healthcare is dependent upon an employer who can fire you without cause #atwill /1
Imagine trying to explain to a European business owner that they're saddled w/their employees healthcare & the fastest growing costs ever /2
Imagine the business & entrepreneurs we create if parents didn't worry that creating a startup would image their child's healthcare /3
Imagine the supplemental insurance markets we would create with a single payer system /4
The reality is you can't truly be pro-business, pro-jobs, pro-entrepreneur or pro-America w/obeying for some sort of single payer plan
This bill will cause unimaginable damage. Anyone involved with it should be absolutely ashamed. How much does a conscience go for? #NoAHCA
Do they 'concern' you enough to vote 'No'? 1/2 of all births in #Ohio are paid for by Medicaid!! Will you really vote to kill babies?
NEW: Per @CommunitySols #BCRA Would Deepen Ohio #Medicaid Cuts; Creating Ohio Shortfall of $58-93 billion by 2030

THEN VOTE NO!!!!
When are you holding a town hall to explain your  concerns (and ours!) over this bill YOU drafted?
Just #voteno sometimes doing what you don't want to do is the best option. #wethepeople #standwithus #killthebill
please answer your phones @senrobportman
There's no way he will side with Ohioans&vote no on this bill.He doesn't have it in him.We need to primary him & get him out. 5 1/2 long yrs
Concern you? What concerns me is how lightly you all seem to take this!
No amendments can make the #TrumpCare bill moral. Your job is to help your constituents. I want to see a video of you voting NO on #AHCA
Imagine a constituent w/ cancer on Medicaid losing healthcare. Then, that lack of care leads to his/her death. How will you feel? VOTE NO!
vote no
Thank you Sen. Portman. Repairs to individual market have nothing to do with caps on Medicaid #DontCapMyCare #MedicaidMatters
Vote "NO" on Wealthcare.  This should be a clear party or people vote.  Please do not let us down.
Hold up, you don't know what's in the health bill?

Bro, you helped draft the thing. And it was released last week
Vote No. This bill will be devastating for me and my family
It's not enough to see you conflicted, senator. That gets us nothing. We need you to vote no to save our healthcare
Does it concern you enough to listen to your constituents and vote no? #NoOnAHCA
Just vote no on it. This is so simple that it's infuriating you won't do that.
This physician urges you to vote NO!! #keepkidscovered #Trumpcare
Yes or no ...
Rob, you have a reputation as a good & decent man, regardless of ideology.
Don't throw that away by caving in to Trump.
Vote NO.
You can't make a "deal" increasing amount allocated to opioid treatment & leave people w/ the devastation of higher premiums & less care
The answer Senator is NONE of them.
I watched. You need to vote No for the reasons you state and many others.
your bill does nothing to deal with the individual market problems you identify.
a serious person would do some research and hold hearings to find out how to address what they think are problems
but you've done no thinking and asked nobody to help you come up with solutions
.@senrobportman You seem to not wish to take my calls. I've tried everyday for two weeks and never get through. Please vote no on AHCA.
When did one of the 27 amendments change James Madison's "General Welfare" clause that was well scrutinized during Va's ratification conv.
Please be compassionate for the children & elderly and vote no to TrumpCare.
How many fewer people will receive care under this bill?  What will the death rate be for opiate addiction?  VOTE NO.
You should be concerned and should vote no. This ohio citizen is watching.
How should Senator Rob Portman vote on AHCA
Medicaid cuts are definitely disturbing, but so is the rest of the bill. Act with morality, do what's best for Ohioans. Vote no. 43614.
This isn't acceptable.  Even Governor Kasich thinks so.  Vote no. #NoOnAHCA
There is a now a requirement to have insurance? Also what about lifetime maximum's?
How do I move from Ohio to Canada Rob? Gonna need your help on this. How can your office help?
"Concern"- if you vote yes on this bill, you have no credibility on the opioid problem you tweet about regularly.
Then vote no. It's that simple.
Tax cuts for the rich paid for by the poor should concern you too.
Please vote no.
