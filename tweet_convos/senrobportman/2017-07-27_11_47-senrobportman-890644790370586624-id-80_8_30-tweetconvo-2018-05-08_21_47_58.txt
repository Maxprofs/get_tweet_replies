Love the way you're trying to take the focus of not honoring your pledge to repeal obamacare.  Typical politician that why we support Trump
Do you know what the other name for weasel ?, I give you a clue, those who vote after everyone one voted.
The @GOP is terrorizing American citizens too. Time to call them out!
You will not distract us from healthcare
You betrayed legal-citizens of USA/Ohio! ACA=redistribution! Repeal ACA mandates/16TH AMENDMENT! Taking from workers to enable Mooches! BYE!
Let me call you out senator Portman, for not standing for state of Ohio. You sold us out in ACA. I'm not sure why you are talking SK
I'm terrified of losing my health coverage or having it become unaffordable--and so is everyone else!
Good luck with that. You'll have to get it by your Russian oligarch is the WH.
Well if you are so worried about North Korea then go over there & face the crazy! God knows you face it everyday with Trump! So be careful

Should we call NATO to defend the US against @realDonaldTrump terrorizing American citizens.
Shut up
#RobPortman has and is terrorizing American (and Ohio) citizens with his reluctance to stand up to terrible GOP bills. COWARD!
The GOP is terrorizing the American ppl need to call out GOP has trump bitches.
I can stay out of N.Korea.  I can't stay out of my country. Stop @realDonaldTrump from ruining my country!!
MOAB!×1000= compliant hostels. Negotiating useless,Diplomacy isn't affective.MOAB talks and BS walks.Anything less codons outbursts #MAGA
Please explain to us, in Ohio, why the hell you voted yes? I hope this is the straw that breaks the camels back. You are no good for Ohio.
Meanwhile millions are set to lose health insurance, health screenings and birth control thru PP. You have no soul
You know who I'm terrified of? Our demented President and the spineless GOP who enable his madness.
Know what terrorizes American citizens? Politicians like you, who work for big donors while relying on votes from the gullible lower classes
Here's a different kind of terror, Senator, the kind you're creating for your constituents.
Trump is terrorizing American citizens. What are you willing to do to stop it??
Actually, you are terrorizing Americans more than NK is, Baby Killer!
How about calling out Senators that vote for bills before they voted against it.  #ObamaCare - Rob Portman lied to Ohio citizens


@SenateGOP has and is terrorizing American citizens. The U.S. must call out the @GOP fir what it is. #KillTheBillDontKillUs
OR the GOP for terrorizing us w/ this insane healthcare business! Worried sick about my son w/ disabilities in the individual market.
You need to back POTUS or you'll get voted out I&many others pay double what we used to with less coverage& higher deductibles& we r voters
Just like our president. Distraction, distraction, distraction. Party over country. Smooth.
Look in the Mira Rob or better yet meet with your constituents so you can see up close and personal The fear and pain you are causing

You're terrorizing us with your attempts to take away our healthcare.
Yes I would appreciate your supporting our health care. Get it repealed ASAP and then work out the particulars.
@potus will get us all killed with a tweet about NK, so ...
Now, about healthcare. Save theACA and just fix it. Work w/ Dems.
But your buddy 45 can intimidate and threaten anyone who votes against him? Talk about terrorizing some more Rob...you sound silly!
Donald Trump is terrorizing American citizens right HERE in this country. Why don't you call yourselves (repubs) for THAT?? Hypocrite much?
.@SenateGOP & .@HouseGOP ARE TERRORIZING AMERICAN CITIZENS.RIPPING AWAY HEALTHCARE FROM 22M IS TERRORISM & MUST BE CALLED OUT FOR WHAT IT IS
NK is bad, but so is not having health insurance. You only get to vote on one of those things today. Please vote no-we need bipartisan work!
The Republican Party has and is terrorizing American Citizens. The U.S. must call out the GOP party for what it is.
You sir, have betrayed your Ohio voters....
And you are terrorizing American citizens by threatening their health care. #ProtectOurCare #SaveMedicaid #FixACA #bipartisanship

6- What could you possibly negotiate @robportman that would be worth making health care much more expensive for everyone? 
You know what else is terrorizing American citizens? The Republican health care plan.

Thank you for your concern about North Korea, but I really will sleep better at night knowing that you vote correctly for health care.
