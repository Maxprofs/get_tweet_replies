how about voting to lower drug costs? How about not repealing healthcare for 20 million people?
The ONLY thing the senate and house should act quickly on is investigating Russian espionage in the White House.

@PatTiberi
@PatTiberi what if there are higher priorities, such as #Treason? Don't pat yourselves on the back so quickly.

Easy for you to take a strong stand on an obvious problem like heroin. What's your position on Trump's ties to Russia?
senate should act quickly on investigating Russian interference. Demand Trump tax returns.
the Senate needs to act quickly to figure out what the hell is going on with the executive branch in Russia
@PatTiberi also, are you aware that #whitesupremacism is on the rise in Ohio. Perhaps you might address that topic?
supply and demand. The demand is here. You are barking up the wrong tree.
Senate should act quickly to 1) demand POTUS taxes 2) investigate Russia connections 3) stand up for what's right!!
