Fix healthcare...very important to GOP future
Yes But acting accordingly not easy. Needs courage
I feel I don't need to state the obvious, but I will: priorities differ here.
Destination Based Cash Flow Tax is an actual idea. Maybe y'all should give it a second look.
By fixing the tax code he means making sure rich people can pay us less and provide less benefits while keeping their inheritance untouched.
You mean today's Trump&GOP version of voodoo trickle-down economics whereby 1% gets richer and the rest of us get royally screwed?
Shut up liberal
No there isn't!
ONE MORE TIME: trickle down doesn't work!!!!!!
Tell me Einstein...how does money trickle up?!
Sad.
Republicans are in control of congress, senate and White House. Isn't this what you've always wanted? Why is nothing getting done?
It's time @senrobportman to get on board with your Republican colleagues; as Ohio supporter, very disappointed with your current position.
Yes, he should definitely get on board with his Republican colleagues like @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @SenCapito #KeepACA #NoRepeal
And perpetuate our welfare state?
Bipartisanship sounds cool... Hey, is there any other bill you can think of that could use a bipartisan solution?
NEW! @FoxNews #Poll 74% want GOP to reach out to Dems on #healthcare MORE: http://fxn.ws/2uJTLrS  
#NoExcuses  #StopTRUMPCare
So instead of "fixing" the tax code, why don't you repeal and replace?  Or you could repeal and replace in 2 years.
Fix Obama care, if you dare
Did Trump teach you how to tweet?
Rob wants the poor to pay their fair share! Greedy Fraud.
Bipartisan? Really? Like who?
Actions speak louder than words dude! Put it on Trump's desk!!!
"Simplifying the tax code" GOP programs have nice sounding names, but always end up being huge slice for 1% while we get a nibble.
Of all the billionaires we elected Trump. Too bad not Warren Buffett
Hell I'd settle for Vince McMahon. Even he is less of a showboating buffoon.
Sir, how about speaking up for your constituents rather than cowarding at the face of extremists in the rep' party. Show some backbone!
There is nothing bipartisan about the 2 bills.
NO TAX CUTS TO DEFUND THE ACA.
Don't change the subject. 
POTUS 45 does enough of that.
What a blabber mouth! Fix it already, quit talking about it and just do it! You're not up for reelection for years, so just do your job.
As least you package this shit in a palatable way, but shit is still shit- trump just vomits this and then tweets offensively
Bipartisan?! Think ur reading too many tweets from Soros' paid hacks, that aren't even in our state. Repeal and replace that crud Obamacare!
Why don't you and the rest of the GOP fix this broken presidency. Trump, Ryan and McConnell are leading our country to hell. You OWN that!
No to Trumptax reform Would eliminate deductions for head of household & earned income credit hurting low & middle income families
If by fixing,you mean giving tax breaks to the rich ..forget it.  How much money do you people need? Learn to live on less like we do!
Stick with bipartisan. You'll get the moderate vote and win. Avoid fringe groups either side.
Not fooled Rob. Code 4 tax breaks to wealthy no benefit to middle class. Trump INC still uses cheap foreign labor. What r u doing 4 Ohioans
Does this mean to 'fix' for the wealthy?! Does this mean you 'cave' for Trumpcare?
Yes, like making sure @realDonaldTrump real and other plutocrats pay their fair share, and prove it. 
#WhereAreTrumpsTaxReturns
Man, don't lie, there hasn't been a bipartisan consensus on anything since the 70s.
There is a consensus that you need get nose out of John Cs back door work with POTUS for the good of us all or be Sweep away next election
Send Portman, remember that your reelection hinges on keeping your promises. Failure is not an option.
Yes, why is everything that you want to change broken? Things can be improved. The only thing broken is the presidency.
Actually, Rob, I think the tax structure should return to what it was in the prosperous 1950s and 1960s. You know, a progressive tax.
Rob wants a regressive tax. Put the burden of government on those least able to afford. Not very Christian, Rob.
: There is bipartisan consensus that the Obamacare can be improved. Are you going to work with Democrats for the country?
More empty promises
Agreed that the tax code needs work to spread the responsibility among thise mist privileged, too. Tax co. Fairly, and tax churches finally
The American workers & the corporations they work for are 2 different entities. Corporate welfare needs to stop for workers to succeed.
Why do you always claim everything is BROKEN? What do you do in the senate besides cater to the wealthy?
Tax reform w/out potus's tax returns is disquieting.   Transparency 1st.
#simplify
We need tax reform so the wealrhy,  industry, big businees and churches pay their fair share and relieve the burden on middle America.
Won't  work if billionaires get a  big break while  the  working poor and middle-class don't  get significant  help. Let's  see T's tax 1st
No more "trickle down"
We'll believe it when we see it. We've yet to see you support this President's agenda that the People voted for! Our agenda, not your career
What about capital flight to offshore tax havens? There are literally billions sitting offshore that the IRS can't see.
I look back at wen Dubya was Pres.  Tax cuts made my property tax, driver's license, sales, county taxes increase lots.
However, giving HUGE tax cuts to the wealthy isn't the way to go.
For all the times you've commented on this I've yet to see you list an example of a broken code/regulation or what you would do to fix it.
Same shit, different day, Rob.
Educ, job trng & re-trng programs 4 former fossilfuel employees makes our workers more competitive. Tax fixes just make your donors more $$$
Just remember that there is no amendment that can fix what is wrong with the senate version of trumpcare. NONE.
Maybe if we are talking about making the tax code MORE progressive. But not if you mean "tax the rich less". @indivisibledyt @OHDems
Senator, does it ever strike you that your party's entire economic philosophy is based on the work of a fiction writer?
Vote next week WHY what's the Rush before you improve Obamacare for all America's !!
America's will recall this show in 2018!
By "make Ohio and American workers more competitive" he means make their bosses more profitable. It'll all trickle down on them...right?
And now you're trying to change the discussion. Everything is broken according to you. It will be if GOP breaks it. #ohio
You DO know that means tax relief for middle and lower income Americans, don't you? That kind of flies in the face of your Randian mantra.
You've let large corps off the tax hook for years and all we got were sky high CEO salaries and scraps for the workers. Need living wages!
Talk talk talk talk!
Fix the tax code means rich guys like yourself pay less in taxes and the poor and middle pay more.
Is there? Got any sources for this vague comment, Tweetaide?
Add a livable minimum wage while you're at it
Where?
We don't want "trickle down" - failed us in the '80's and started the chain of events that led to the decimation of the middle class.
FIX THIS - greatest wealth inequality since Great Depression. 50% of Americans living paycheck to paycheck.  How do we fix this?
and the voters scream death to republicans careers who vote for trumcare
There is a bipartisan consensus that you should have a #REALTownHallNOW.
#scheduleit
No there isn't. These tax code changes are only helping the upper class. Take that bullshit elsewhere
If corporate and 1% tax cuts come at our expense (from the budget, this looks to be the case), how does that help US in the end?
Actually, latest reports show employers are having problems filling openings. They don't need #taxreform they need to pay more!!!
Bipartisanship? What's that?
Is there a bipartisan committee for this major issue?
Ohioans believe in everyone paying their fair share. Do you? Does President Trump?
No to Right to Work!  Get rid of payday lenders!  No tax cuts for the rich! How about some tax increases for the rich, decreases for others.
So now we like to "fix" things do we? Why not just a full repeal of the tax code senator?? FIX THE ACA FIRST!!!
No, the only reason the GOP want tax reform is to get tax breaks for the rich.  They tried that through killing people by abandoning the ACA
Don't just do corporate giveaways - that doesn't = jobs. Corps can do dividends/buybacks/mergers, which don't create jobs. Create jobs.
How about we cut your pay to $13 a hour, and get killed by taxes every 2 weeks. I think you would change your mind.
Billionaires don't need tax breaks.  Middle/working class? Sure, we could use some help. But we don't want KOCH/PAC policies.
The tax code won't be simplified because the biggest lobbyists and donors don't want it to be. You owe your seat to Intuit. Stop pretending.
Whenever you hear that a Democrat is on board with anything Trump wants, something sneeky is about too happen
You out.  Repeal ObamaCare.
There is a #bipartisan consensus you need to #fixaca also.  How about some talk on that?
Repeal and replace the health care bill
Living wage and equal pay!! Then we can talk about taxes on those incomes!
Isn't that also known as tax cuts for the wealthy?
That doesn't mean you give a massive tax cut to the rich, but we all know that is what you are going to try to do
Um, which Dems are on board with this broad bipartisan consensus you lying ? I LOVE how you say your against bills AFTER they fail, a-hole.
So are you going to work for a bipartisan solution or is it just going to be a small group of Repubs in a back room writing bills again???
Great - now do bipartisan health care reform!

To be clear, Obamacare isn't failing. @realdonaldtrump is sabotaging it. 
The GOP is leaderless right now.  Trump doesn't understand why TrumpCare is a disaster.  But no one will stand up to him.
