Make sure everyone has healthcare. Trying to keep the drugs out doesn't work. Many opiods are legally prescribed. #NoGrahamCassidy
Quit posting these unless you really believe and if you do you have no recourse but to vote no on Graham- Cassidy
you do realize that the G-C will hurt the fight against opioids by cutting Medicaid. (cont) http://tl.gd/no51ka 
The bill you can act on to help  with opiate addiction and recovery is to vote no on graham Cassidy.
There's also a bill that will take healthcare away from millions that you're probably going to vote for.
Why are you afraid of the big pharma companies that are making billions off of these opioids? This is all legal, not illegal.
Waste of time
Interdiction is important but so is treatment. It is critical to maintain the Medicaid expansion to provide treatment.
Healthcare would be a good start.
And the opioid crisis will devastate for several decades if Graham- Cassidy passes. You care not for citizens. For shame, Sir. For shame.
But, but... Graham-Cassidy?  Please do the right thing and vote NO.
Voting for @grahamcassidybill will not help the opiod crisis that is already. Plz reconsider. Do No Harm.
How would #GrahamCassidy benefit the people of Ohio @senrobportman? do you really think we can afford for 22% of hospitals to close? #waffle
Ohio will be one of the states hurt the worst by Graham/Cassidy bill
@SenSherrodBrown is talking about health care....
Inconsistent 2 support #STOPAct & also support #GrahamCassidy. #Ohio stands 2 lose millions under falsehood of "state flexibility." VOTE NO!
You want to stop drugs and cut money for treatment.
You know what will devastate #Ohio? Millions losing healthcare for rich tax cuts. #VoteNoGrahamCassidy
There's a bill called Graham Cassidy that's going to make opioid problem even worse....VOTE NO!
Are u kidding me?U have a lot of nerve tweeting this & still have no words against GrahamCassidy. Do you realize what it does to treatment??
Healthcare crisis continues to potentially devastate Vets, Disabled , kids, seniors, low income . #VoteNo
STOP PEOPLE FROM DYING WITHOUT HEALTHCARE.
Get back to work and stop tweeting!
Hey Rob, there's another bill you need to vote NO on. GC sound familiar?
Thereâ€™s one called Graham - Cassidy that will eliminate access to care for those in need. #NoGrahamCassidy listen to the people of #Ohio
Rehab will be slashed if Graham Cassidy passes!  HOW are you going to VOTE????
Rob, in his tower, refusing to speak to his constituents. A sadist that enjoys hearing ppl beg him not kill them by ruining HC. A monster.
This President continues to devastate #USA. There are ways Congress can stop him, #IMPEACH #25thamendment, and save our country. #DoItNow
When you vote AGAINST #GrahamCassidy I will believe you care about the #opiodcrisis. Each time you vote to repeal Obamacare shows hypocrisy.
Odd how you talk about stopping drug crisis, but take lots of campaign money from big Pharm. #hypocrite #lastterm
STOP PORTMAN FROM KILLING OHIO.
So are you going to vote to take away the #Healthcare that they need to get treatment?
You keep posting comments about the #opiodcrisis, but then will take away healthcare from these people you pretend to protect. DO YOUR JOB
No #GrahamCassidy
Graham-Cassidy will destroy funding for Medicaid, which helps with opioid treatment. Vote no on Graham-Cassidy.
Stop trying to take away health care that includes rehabilitation for drug addiction.
Voting yes on the #GrahamCassidyDeathBill will also devastate Ohioans! Please help your constituents 
Your bill does nothing about curbing opioids produced in US, so this just helps your donors. 
Let's talk #GrahamCassidy instead!
And these Ohioans need healthcare. Why are you ignoring that?
Is that coming over on cargos that ship product to us from China and Mexico....
So if you vote yes on #GrahamCassidy, will you be TinMan, Scarecrow, or Cowardly Lion to Trump's Wizard of Oz?
Great but those already suffering from addiction won't have healthcare with #GrahamCassidy No to #GrahamCassidy Yes to #MedicareForAll
Vote No on #GrahamCassidy and help Puerto Rico! Why won't you address the pressing issues your constituents are calling and asking about??
then do as @realDonaldTrump wants close of any contact with the outside world BUT better make the middle class happy .  Healtcare as example
Drugs will come in because of the demand. Drugs don't cause the problem. Keeping some out increases the price and the crime. SAD!!!
I tried calling 4 of your OH offices, all busy/mailboxes full. That's because we want to know if you'll vote NO on GC! It's terrible for OH!
uh right
CONMAN @senrobportman voted to STEAL coverage from 200,000 Ohioans a year receiving substance abuse treatment through Medicaid!!!
#HYPOCRITE

This is Colleen of ADAPT.

I have no idea what this country is supposed to be 
LYIN' @senrobportman doesn't care that opioid funding has been stripped from G-C, he still wants to STEAL your healthcare for his TAX CUT!!!
There's a bill in Congress called Graham-Cassidy which will destroy the ability of indigent opiate addicts to get treatment.
Instead of building the clear wall ,spend that money on the opioid crisis. Vote NO on Graham/Cassidy.
How about that GOP healthcare bill? I hear it does nothing?
Bad insurance. Rather put u on pain management then approve an MRI to help fix the problem. Been fighting for one for 3 years now.
That's why you vote NO on Graham Cassidy and work to fix ACA.
And there's a bill in Congress called #GrahamCassidy that will keep treatment out - you should vote against that one
There is a bill that Congress should act AGAINST (#GrahamCassiy) that will exacerbate this epidemic.
People need treatment & they won't get it with Graham Cassidy vote against it
Voting no on #GrahamCassidyBill #CassidyGraham and fixing ACA will also help the #opioidcrisis. Thanks for working to stop sex trafficking
#opioidcrisis? so how does #GrahamCassidyBill help with that
There is also a bill called Graham Cassidy that would cut Medicaid funding which battles opioids
That's why you should LISTEN to Ohioans instead of your 'donors' and vote NO on #CassidyGraham
U must not pay for your health care
No healthcare will not help the opiod crisis But only thing that matters to you is the 1 percent
There's another bill called Graham-Cassidy that will make demand for opiates skyrocket as it kills treatment. Vote no.
Medicare for all would help more.
Is this what you think you'll get for voting for the shameful "health care" act?
Graham Cassidy will devastate opiod treatment.Graham Cassidy and opiod treatment are inherently incompatible. Vote NO on Graham Cassidy.
This is what you tweet when your colleagues leave a hearing? People are asking for their lives, and you tweet this. Shame on you, Senator.
Do you know what would make the #opioidcrisis worse in Ohio? #GrahamCassidy. Reject it!
Speaking of devastation... Puerto Rico? Americans in desperate need? Anything?

Senator, why do you hate poor people so much? #GrahamCassidy
