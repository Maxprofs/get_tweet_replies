.@senrobportman who I admired, is a huge disappointment

Repeal with 2 year fuse is exactly what we need to create cooperation for replace!
It appears that smooth-talking @senrobportman is as much a sewer rat as other GOPe, bought by insurance Cos & hospitals, beholden to Kasich!
Support them by a no vote on all R attempts to repeal and replace ACA!
Have you thought about just tweeting pictures of kittens? Given your vote last night, we now know that you do not care about Ohioans. #liar
Kittens would be an improvement.
Wrong! Did you see the crowd at Youngstown yesterday?

You don't represent the people of Ohio!
Watch out #CARA ...Portman also promised support to repeal Obamacare, then weenied out when he had to chance to.  His word means nothing.
Yeah, let's fill up our prisons with drug offenders! Idiot

We need more than drug court? Will you pay for those who lose ins. or for increased premiums? Older people are most reliable voters.
Wrong! Did you see the crowd at Youngstown yesterday?

You don't represent the people of Ohio!
if you guys are still pissed about Portman's vote yesterday why don't you let his health LA know: sarah_schmidt@portman.senate.gov
I just sent an email letting them know how disappointed I am
Now, House is trying to neuter the CBO, a 40+-yr-old org., &   make it into KOCH think tank, because you can't deal w/ truth? IT ALL STINKS!
200 billion isn't enough to justify gutting medicaid. These are POISON PILLS to the social safety net & healthcare for many.  VOTE NO!
The skinny on "skinny repeal" is that it screws us just as much as other GOP plans.  DON'T SELL US OUT for an inadequate concession.
He just voted YES last night! SHAME!
He voted YES last night and he's voting again at 3:30 today. Call 844-432-0883!
Are u proud about working 2 take healthcare from those caught by the opioid epidemic?Are u proud of hurting people w/preexisting conditions?
Is there a particular reason I pay people to staff your offices and they can't seem to answer a phone?
I thought you were a cut above the rest. So wrong about you.
Does your staff ever answer the office lines? Tried calling again today and as always right to voicemail.  Check your messages Senator.
Nope haven't in days
Why do you care? It isn't like you plan to help them with the healthcare they will need.
Aren't you special. Let's talk healthcare where you're sticking it to Ohio.
FIX THE ACA!
Please stand up to the bullying jerks and vote NO on a "skinny repeal." Stand up for Ohioans 
xoxo, a product of Kent and cuyohoga falls

Vote YES to a full repeal. U voted dec '15 and campaigned to repeal. Americans are out of money and patience!
If poor kids want healthcare I guess they need to start taking drugs for rob to care
If you vote for these awful plans, you are declaring us COLLATERAL  DAMAGE for giveaways to KOCH's, PAC's and 1%. Do we not matter?
DO NOT VOTE FOR RUSSIAN SANCTIONS!

@GOP - Why do you need medical assistance?! Work harder!!
America- We are! Childcare 75% of min wage!
@GOP - We should lower minimum wage!
So. Do you hate trans people too?  You must, you back everything else 45 does.
Leave my health care alone!!!
When funding ends, court will close #Trumpcare =#Medicaid reduction 
Sold your soul to get a little more funding at the expense of the elderly and children. FUNDING will dry up eventually. I am a constituent
#NoTrumpCare
And drug courts will stop drug use how? Throwing at a problem is what I expect from @TheDemocrats
So a no on fighting opioid addiction but a yea on prosecuting them. Gotta fill those private prisons somehow.
Fraud.
What are you doing for the rest of Ohio who need affordable healthcare?
Stop. Just stop. You were on the committee for this horrendous senate healthcare/tax-cut bill. You moved it forward. You don't care abt us.
You voted AGAINST the help for ALL OHIO citizens yesterday! Don't act like we matter now!
Why don't you call it what it is: Money directly from the debt?

 Baby Killer
Hey, whoever is in charge of this account, tell your boss he's an #OhioTraitor.

Portman & Capito have talked up needing CBO scores. They just voted to waive BCRA's lacking a full CBO score.
Senator - sounds like your constituents could use rehab.  How about giving them med insurance to help out.
One OH company has to forego $200K per month in orders because it can't get enough workers who can pass a drug test: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/24/business/economy/drug-test-labor-hiring.html?_r=0 …
Please put your efforts into AFFORDABLE health care of ALL Ohioans. You seem to have only 1 issues.
I'm waiting for you to say something in support of the transgender community. Waiting ...... waiting..... still waiting.....

So we will pay to charge and incarcerate druggies, but not provide adequate health insurance.
This new skinny repeal will be devastating for the drug crisis. #VoteNo
CBO on repealing the individual mandate ("skinny repeal"): 20% premium spike and 15 million uninsured increase.

How many people called your office asking you not to vote for the MTP & how many called asking you to vote for it?
Oh goodie! What other crumbs shall you bestow upon your constituents to show us your great benevolence? I mean, other than healthcare #BCRA
Truly do not understand your vote last night! Do not vote in plan that cuts Medicaid,Has trash plans,Higher premiums for older/pre existing!
I wouldn't be feeling proud of myself if I was in your shoes right now. But you have no moral compass.
Why don't you just pack up and move permanently to D.C. The thought that you will be an Ohio senator for another 5 1/2 years sickens me.
But alas with our healthcare in ruin, I can't afford to be sick. Just leave. Your sir do not deserve to be called an Ohioan.
Thoughts on military transgender patriots banned by your president?
Vote no on repeal only.
Gov. Kasich says $1 billion Ohio spends on opioid fight comes mostly from "state and federal #Medicaid spending". Why do you want to cut it?
http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2017/04/house_republicans_earmark_1706.html … Everything else is just peanuts. Peanuts can't cure addictions. Real healthcare & social services can. #NoBCRA
I realize drug importation, detection, & trtmnt are important to you. Realize that health care is important to your constituents.
#ConMan @senrobportman & his GOP comrades passed #CARA with $0.00 in funding.... ZIP, ZILCH, NADA!!! #ConManRob #Hypocrite #AllTalkNoAction
You suck.
You wrote an amendment that guts Medicaid money to the states. Why do you keep pretending you care about helping people?
Not having health insurance will have to be added to this list. Thanks Rob.

Don't forget Senator Trumpcare is an abomination Fix ACA or go to single payer Premiums based on income Negotiate drug prices
If you gave a crap about those with opioid or any addiction issues you wouldn't have voted to repeal the ACA.
Why is the drug epidemic a separate issue from healthcare to you?  How could you vote to debate bad legislation rather than fix ACA?
He must see it as a rich, white person problem. Some little white girl OD'd.
Agreed, and I think you're VERY close to the truth. Still inconceivable that he can separate the issues. Cognitive dissonance strong here.
I'm wealthy, white, and will benefit from this bill. But unlike the GOP, I believe healthcare is a right, not a privilege. #VoteNo
PATHOLOGICAL LIAR @senrobportman wants to STEAL coverage from 200,000 Ohioans a yr receiving AOD treatment through Medicaid!!!

#KeepCalling
