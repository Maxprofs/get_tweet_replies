Hey I can agree with you on that!  But "friend of Russia" Tillerson has no interest.
This is a step in the right direction. I think we should get behind Senate folks during moments when they find their voice like this.
Yes I agree.  I think the Senate is trending towards doing the right thing for the country.
"Trending" is an interesting choice of word. Early stage of "leaning" but definitely not as far as "committing"
Not to pick nits over word choice, but the Russian sanctions bill was a positive step, plus bipartisan support for Mueller.
Agreed & Delighted when they were signed. Now if Tillerson would only follow them...
Tillerson is an interesting figure. At times he seems like his own man & others like a RUS pawn. Need more data pts 2 figure him out.
I don't trust him at all
What State Dept? Try calling on someone to FILL THE VACANCIES at the State Dept. #payattention
#ShameOnPortman
Have a damn #REALTownHallNOW.
Filling the vacancies cant be done until names are put FORTH. That is Tillerson and Trumps job, NOT CONGRESS.
Right. And Congress is a check on the Executive Branch. @senrobportman & co should be "calling on" them to staff the damn State Dept!
I'm not arguing with you, just pointing out the facts. Tillerson & Trump do not want it staffed. THAT is the problem.
Heard. That's why I want my reps 2 #standuptothebully & start fighting for their country & constituents. @senrobportman doesn't care though.
Problem is their fight is with Trump alone..
@ChrisMurphyCT @StateDept  our SSA, our EPA & Interior Dept. Without consent of American ppl. Asking ppl to retire early.
And tell them to act as American! (First).
@ChrisMurphyCT @StateDept  our government. Demand Tillerson!! He works for 330 million ppl. This administration is destroying
@ChrisMurphyCT @StateDept  They have 38 top seats empty. Numerous empty below. What the hell are you ALLOWING them to do to
Please. 

I have a plan to beat the Russians to the Biodiesel-Punch in Uruguay.

Been trying hard to get hold of the right ppl. Even my Rep
By offering Uruguay's Air Force FREE Su-27s.  

Nothing in this World is free.. Especially from the Russian government.

#FlyingMemorials
FIXED IT 4 U!
I am calling on @senrobportman to use his vote as his constituents wish him to. Which can ONLY be accomplished by 1/2
@senrobportman holding REGULAR LIVE TOWN HALLS! WHICH HE REFUSES TO DO! 2/2
2/2 to advertise against & discredit the ACA???


Could we transfer this Cyber Unit from State over to Pentagon, under Mattis, until Tillerson is removed? Friend of Putin is USA Enemy...
We are playing KETCHUP in regards to our cyber warfare capabilities, but the motivation to bitch slap Putin is REAL.   We will prevail.
Thank Senator Rod Portman @nytimes @DavidColeACLU @washingtonpost @DebraMessing

Schiff: Impaneling of a grand jury wouldn't be taking place if there was no "evidentiary basis" to move forward. 

This physician/insurance company CEO says that #ACA isn't failing.
It's being sabotaged by Trump.
…

On this day in 1965, LBJ signed the Voting Rights Act into law, to guarantee African Americans the right to vote. 
Please do! It was set aside and a flagrant dereliction for the djt administration to refuse it.
@ChrisMurphyCT @StateDept the backs of the American ppl. Destroying science, destroying our protections. We didn't ask 4 this
Why do we have diplomatic ties. Why are they on UN Security Council vetoing Syrian war crimes indictments

Once Trump owed 4 billion dollars to 70 American banks then the Russians helped him,... and the rest is history. 
#NoRefugeeBan #NoTravelBan
@ChrisMurphyCT @StateDept & how many members won election using stolen hacked data in Ryan's SuperPac dumped by Guccifer. The
@ChrisMurphyCT @StateDept  Is Trump & Tillerson destroying the State Dept as payback for Putin? He hates the State Dept &
@ChrisMurphyCT @StateDept  This is wrong. It's obvious this is a Koch inspired move. Rob, we did not elect Charles Koch to
I wholeheartedly agree. And this money is to counter ISIS propaganda too. Who can be against this?

Today marks the anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, but five decades later voter suppression laws still threaten access to the polls. 
I wish you had made this statement during the campaign!
@ChrisMurphyCT @StateDept  diplomacy.This Congress is complicit in destroying it as well. I wonder how many names Mueller has

#Syria might not be in the news any more but the planes still fill the sky and the bombs they drop are still killing and maiming thousands 
Really Rob? #Iraq #Afghanistan #Libya #Syria .. I oppose US disinformation. Do you?
Kucinich has always seemed to me to be a little Kremlin friendly.
Are you really comparing US propaganda to ISIS and Putin? I'm glad you were gerrymandered out of congress.
USA created ISIS by funding Bin Laden
 and Helped Yeltsin & his Man Putin Get Elected.

@ChrisMurphyCT @StateDept  GOP are in trouble.
@ChrisMurphyCT @StateDept  dismantle our government or anyone else for that matter. This is outrageous you're doing it behind
Stop fooling around w/all this blocking nonsense and just go for impeachment.
If Tillerson doesn't use it, remove him for violating his oath of office.

What abt the WH propaganda and disinfo? Why aren't you calling out that?
#payattention
#ShameOnPortman
#REALTownHallNOW
Unfortunately it's the same thing. Countering Russian propaganda and deza IS countering WH deza. Thats why DOS hasn't done it. #awkward
TrumpTV diff than Russian propaganda and shld be addressed as well as the many lies come out of DJT's mouth. By not commenting they ok it
Absolutely.
And who's funding tRump TV?????
I think it's the trump campaign currently.
Gotcha. His "reelection" campaign then. Ironic on several levels
45 is paying instead for his propaganda folder to make him smile!
You mean that new Trump TV crap?
It's good to see you take this position @senrobportman Trump & Co are treasonous, including Tillerson.
Please make sue SCL does not get contract.


Portman you are Gutless

There's no line item veto - they're breaking the law

Amend FY 18 Approps to remove Tillerson's obstruction
In one sentence:

"For purposes of this funding, the authority of the Sec of State is hereby delegated to the Office of ____"
On June 13, Sen For Relations Comm held a hearing w/ Tillerson

Portman is on the Committee but didn't even show up
All be careful what u wish for.. ScL grp has uncontested contracts w state dept. Why important? This grp tied to Bannon, Flynn and Russia
So delegate authority to a lower level below Tillerson.  And hold oversight.

Unconscionable not to implement the funds as required by law.
Agreed must use funds the proper way Obamacare intended.
That's great, thank you! But what about the propaganda & disinformation the current administration is propagating?
You know, Rob... you COULD simply have the bastard arrested.
Thank you @senrobportman  Our President is impotent when it comes to this subject

Agreed. Please keep pushing for this to happen
I may not agree with @senrobportman on much but I do on this. We are waiting, @StateDept. Do your job!
@Russia told @realDonaldTrump that money could better be spent on golf trips to NJ or Fla or NY for no reason other then whatever the Fuck
Shouldn't be a problem but Tillerson was Putin's #2 US BF. All actions up to date have most likely put him in the lead as Putin's #1 BFF.
Glad for your efforts Portman, how about a little loyalty to your country rather than your self and your  party?
Thank you...something must be done because the Russian efforts are ONGOING!
Good luck with that with Tillerson in charge of @StateDept ! He is another member of "Putin's Regime"
Funny how in the court of lies which IS shameful US Propaganda & where political thugs like Portman reign, alternative opinions are cursed
I can appreciate the baby steps
You can muster more than that, no?
Weak senator.
I still trust cardboard Rob more, but good, I guess?
Sounds good but doesn't atone for votes to confirm Gorsuch, Pruitt, Devoss, Perry, Price, etc.  Those votes have caused harm.
Says the guy who voted with Trump to take away our healthcare.... Too late to pretend you have any moral compass.
Perhaps some of the money can go toward Trump's new "real news" as well as Sinclair broadcasting

Scientists are worried Trump won't give the  to release this report. So... it seems like someone "released" it to the NYT https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/894712038211059712 …
Thank you @senrobportman . Any way to stop the WH lies? Stop trump's new "tv station"?
CounteringForeignPropaganda & Disinformation Act of 2016 is really the Ministry of Truth to counter Domestic Independent news! #FireMcMaster
Take charge, and don't let @SenMajLdr keep fighting against working across the aisle. You men and women were entrusted to do right 4 ppl.
I voted for you but regret it. Had no idea you were a rino that does not support our potus and the policies  that elected him.Never Portman!
Good work sir. We really need this, and we need Senators like you to take a stand and say enough is enough. It's time to start working 4 us.
You should all be insisting and insisting Tillerson stop dismantling the State Department and weakening US presence overseas.
Start with Trumps' tweets
Your president and secretary of state care more about Russia than they do America. Rid us of them.
But it will make Puty mad!! Can't do that!
Seems like you want them to waste our tax payer dollars? They said they have enough funds already. You want them to throw it?
While you let @SenateMajLdr who let it happen and #SoCalledPresident who benefitted run amuck. You're a #ComplicitRepublican @SenateGOP
1/2 How about requiring a reimbursement of funds from the money allocated to insurance companies to defray costs to citizens that was used
I suggest they start w/ the Russian propagandist in the White House.
About f'ing time.
2 thumbs up.
Finally! Country over party! Thank you 
Well, republicans control everything
WeMust #ImpeachTheTyrant along w #PutinsPlan #TreasonTeam member #Tillerson #Exxon #PutinsYesMan #prohibited_gases #Syria #TrumpRussia
I'm calling for you to quit. #weenie
tillerson wont. he is in bed with the russians.
At least we agree on this! From your Ohio constituent. #criminalTRUMP
Thank you Sen. Portman!
This liberal thanks you, Senator. 
bizarre & scary that the State Dept has to be forced to accept approved funding to defend our natl sec from Russian influence #NotNormal
http://dashboard.securingdemocracy.org/ 
Agree! So what's the delay?
Because it’s not the #Russians it’s the #FakeNewsIndustrialComplex #FakeNews #BREAKING #NeoLiberal #propaganda #MAGA
Why isn't the State Department already doing that?
Good luck with Rex at the helm. #RussianTool
#trumpRussia Puppet(s) want to spend the money elsewhere.
What @StateDept ? Its been gutted!! #shame
Bout time some you GOP grew some balls
Mr. Pittman, the damage is done, you were very instrumental in enabling this train wreck of a presidency, you will pay dearly at ballot box.
Thank you for taking the high road in putting country & our national security over party
It's a shame that we have to beg the goverment & the administration (and the state department) to just do the right thing. DEPLORABLE!!!!!!!
@StateDept  yes!  trump tv would be an excellent beginning
Oh?  We're short 38 State Department Deputy Administrators, and you think there's someone at State who's reading your Twitter feed?
It's about time - past, actually! - that you & other Rs push back on this buffoon in the WH & his administration. We are a worldwide joke!
Portman you are a phoney http://rino.you  and our half ass governor will never ever get my (or my friends)support again. Disgusting
We are calling on you to impeach this President. Before he tears this country completely apart.
THANK YOU!
Tillerson doesn't want to protect us from Russia because he knows Trump already sold the USA to Russia. Mueller will find the details.
...what funding?
When tillerson and trump see their bank accounts counting in rubles though, why would they hurt their cash cow? #goprussia #resist #gopspies
Russia is a hoax!  Cyber security should be a Yuge Bigly concern but POTUS rather golf
Finally a Republican doing the right thing. Thank you for speaking out
And constituents have been calling on you and other GOP Senators to stop acting as partisan rubber stamps...we don't always get what we want
For once I agree with u. But u need to do more!  U need to listen to your constituents!
What the heck took you so long? 45 has to leave DC before you find your spine?
What are going to do about the Russia puppet in the White House...let me guess...nothing!
#Tillerson the traitor won't do that...
About time. It's embarrassing that the USA would fall behind on fighting Russian propaganda machine. Russia 1 - USA 0
so then you will support efforts to ensure that Mueller is allowed to continue and not ousted?
bizarre & scary that the State Dept has to be forced to accept approved funding to defend our natl sec from Russian influence #NotNormal
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/08/04/would-even-care-if-was-guilty.html … - this is the new GOP platform.....
You seem to make sense @ times! Still don't trust you to look out for Ohio's Poor & Seniors.
What are you doing to counter THIS propoganda? This is North Korean stuff! #ImpeachTrumpPence
WATCH: @kayleighmcenany left CNN yesterday....today, she made her debut on Trump TV sharing "the real news". 
Senator, does that include counter Trump sponsored Russian propaganda??
Bold.
Thank you, Senator. I'm gravely concerned about Sec Tillerson's hollowing out of State Dept., & refusal to take a strong stance against RUS.
How about next time not voting to promote the trumpdon'tcarehealthbill.
Thank you Senator Portman. I will urge my State Senators to do the same.
And call upon your fellow senators to do the same sir!
You're a hack, Portman. And who are you kidding, anyway? You have no spine.
TRAITORS
Give the money to @selectedwisdom and I'm sure he'd coordinate an amazing program.
I think it's a good thing for Senate to push back and stand up for the people they were elected to represent and speak truth.
I hope that you're not too late, Senator. You & your Republican colleagues have hampered so much of the investigations. I hope we survive.
Yes,yes yes,!!!!!!
Thank you Senator Portman!
About time folks in the senate start to defend our country against these madmen that occupying the WH!
Why isn't it TREASON that tillerson chooses continued Russian hacking over USA.  Any other admin or country would consider it TREASON.
I'm in complete agreement
Good! So when can we expect the @StateDept to begin countering Trump's pro-Russia propaganda & disinfo?
You might also remind him about the $250 Million in the Countering Russia Influence Fund from Sec. 254 HR 3364 (he just signed). 
Non working state dept. in name only
I'm with you on this.
yo please read chomsky's manufacturing consent to comprehend the scope of the US propaganda machine
seriously
please
Please be a patriot - country over party
We need to change the laws back so that this can no longer legally happen here. We used to have laws that prohibited this 
Thank you @senrobportman  for taking this stand.
Does this include @FoxNews too?
@JohnFugelsang @StateDept Can we start with the propaganda coming from the WH?
Thanks Senator!
It's obvious that #Tillerson was appointed by #Putin n has been advancing #Russian agenda.

@TEN_GOP @3lectric5heep #Resist
Thank you from a fellow citizen. Party should not matter.
Portman: wrong on healthcare, right on this.
Oh thank God there are grown ups left in Washington
Thank you!
Drain the swamp
Please keep defending our democracy.....we need more heroes! Your bravery to speak truth to power will be rewarded! 
Good start. But Sinclair deal puts it on mandatory replay in 3/4 of country!!
While you're at it work on tightening up the campaign contributions laws - almost $400,000 from insurance + big pharma - explains your votes
Can you also do something about US-based #propagandists #SinclairBroadcasting - 73 local news outlets in 33 states - showing #TrumpTV ?
Too ate, Rexit is well on its way....
But Senator, that is exactly what brought GOP to power, the origin of which now resides in the Whitehouse. Start there.
@MelissaJPeltier
You might have made this an issue before you voted to install Tillerson as SoS

You haven't backed our President  people voted for! Many GOP senators will be leaving. Dems. have committed so many crimes & GOP does zero!
Thank you!
Don't give a crap about Russia.   This IS done & nothing else! GROSS! NOT FOOLING ANYONE!  REAL ISSUES: BUDGET, HEALTHCARE, DEFENSE !
Good. But I still remember your votes on healthcare and DeVos
Americans are calling on Congress to start DOING THEIR JOBS and hold the madman they cheated to get elected accountable. We see you!!
I need clarification: does this include Russian propaganda coming out of the White House?
AND to staff up!!
Bravo Senator Portman 
Could you start by shutting down oxymoron & State/Trump propaganda site "The Real News" - That would be helpful.
Now you're ready to do what's right? Our country is viewed as toilet water around the world but NOW that you won't look bad you're in? Puss
POTUS have made State as feckless as it has ever been. Diplomacy be damned. Dangerous game you are playing by allowing this madness to go on
Good! Keep going.
I am calling on you to call POTUS out on this. Tillerson is clearly acting on POTUS' orders.
I do not know Tillerson’s mind but his actions reek of Russian collaboration. #PutinsRussia is an existential enemy of American democracy.
Can the regime be any more obvious about which country they serve? #ImpeachTrump
Get. Rid. Of. Bannon.
45 is attacking your fellow us senator #Blumenthal on twitter this am #pathetic
What @StateDept?
Seems to be a reasonable request.
THANK YOU!  Please ensure this happens.
Are you seriously dipping your toes into the right side of history? Interesting. Will see ...
Start with Fox News
PRECISELY... and You - YOU! - Could begin by ACKNOWLEDGING it. Thus far, it's appeared as nominal GOP musings. CALL IT OUT ALREADY!!!
@mellieruth54 @StateDept Good luck with that.
Please, spare us! You are a traitor.
What State Dept??
Great to see Portman fighting for the workers of Ohio! Oh wait, he's expanding Fed bureaucracy with baseless warmongering?
Agree would  be good if that happens
