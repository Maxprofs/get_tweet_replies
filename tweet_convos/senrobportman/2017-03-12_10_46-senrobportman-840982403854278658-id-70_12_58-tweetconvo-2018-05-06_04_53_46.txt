Where do you stand on allowing corporations to demand genetic testing of employees as part of wellness programs?
Dear, u are far too easily 'pleased'-U'r constituents, on the other , are NOT pleased a'tal. Health coverage for all  pls
Trump care would endanger many lives and jobs. Preventative medicine is much more cost effective than the ED.
#Ohio voters want to share our concerns with *YOU*! Give us what we want #TownHall
Say no to #trumpcare! If the ACA needs work, fix it.
Can't believe I'm saying this but keep the Medicare high earners tax.
Thank you for trying! Moderate Senators like you really need to stand up to this stupidity.
thank you for helping support health care for Ohioans, and bringing concerns to @VP
did you also discuss your concern over the lack of coverage for substance abuse treatment? #Trumpcare
I'm afraid you're going to have to push a lot harder if you want to protect Ohio's Medicaid expansion population.
what should I do if I make too much for Medicaid but not enough to purchase under your plan? I'm an independent contractor
Trumpcare has other problems as well. Tax credits for rich who don't need help paying for anything. @RepMarciaFudge
Stand up for Ohio and make us an example for saying no to #Trumpcare
thanks rob for standing up to #DontheCon and #Trumpcare
you're the lowest form of life there is. I'll c u  on the campaign trail. Your days ruining Ohio and the US are numbered
24 Million people losing healthcare is UNACCEPTABLE! Who do you think will pay 56 million people's medical bills???? .
did you ask him about his view on conversion therapy?
not sure the VP listened: he calls subsidized health care a "nightmare"
just vote against the Healthcare bill. We can do better than that train wreck
why don't you share your concerns ABOUT Pence w/ your Ohio constituents?  Just be honest. Isn't it all just so exhausting
heard Ryan talk about setting up "high risk pools" those are the real death panels. No ACA repeal
Please step aside, Senator. You were elected to bring healthcare reform, not stand in its way.
the same guy you voted for and will raise to power after impeachment? Of course he listened, but it's obvious he didn't hear!
you are a good little puppet.
stand strong AGAINST pressure to vote for a solution that will hurt Millions of Ohioans struggling
I'm sure it carried a lot of weight since he knows you're an empty shirt.
Mr Portman how will you vote on TrumpRyanCare?
And Trumpcare's expense? And its coverage? And its harm to the bottom 50%? Please do not support Trumpcare. Sad.
I hope he listened to you.  Your vote in the senate can keep this bill from passing until the a compromise is made.
It's not enough to share, @senrobportman, you're going to have to fight your own party on behalf of all Ohioans.  Step up.
wonder if you actually got anywhere w him~
.@senrobportman @VP willing to bet a hundred bucks you still vote to pass it as it stands when he ignores you. Any takers? #rubberstampRob
please stand up for all Ohioans and Americans
did you tell him No to trumpcare? Concerns are not a NO vote! Do the right thing SOON
sharing concerns is what lapdogs do - then u can sleep at night knowing u left 1000s of Ohioans w/o insurance
Hopefully he's more attentive than you were on DeVos.
can you please be more specific on your concerns and what your plans are on protecting those you are concerned about?
@VPHow in the world can you be pleased about anything You had your chance to be counted you voted yes on all nominees.COWARD
"pleased I was able to share my concerns w/ @VP". #WeakLeadership. OH expects you to FIGHT for all of us not just 1%.
We would like to share our concerns with you, sir, at a #REALTownHallNOW. #cantleadandhide  #bealeader #SCHEDULETHETOWNHALL
Cool. You also need 2 oppose #ConCare. It screws Ohioans. #DefendandAmendACA. #norepealandreplace #letstalk  #REALTownHallNOW
the @GOP plan will hurt the poor sick & elderly only helps the very rich. #sad #startover
I'm OH small bus. owner had private insurance prior ACA had to go ACA now down to 1 insurance co. Expensive high deduct!
We will remember this come election time. You're to be looking out for your constituents, not just the 1%.
So, in addition to selling out Ohio's education, you have also acted to take insurance from the most vulnerable. Great

Thx @RepJoeKennedy. With an opioid epidemic claiming lives in every corner of America, #Trumpcare cuts off access to life-saving treatment. https://twitter.com/repjoekennedy/status/839625760575008768 …
I’m glad you told @VP that you loved that part of Obamacare. But why don’t you think everyone else should have the same?
how about the concerns about how #Trumpcare will hurt millions of Ohioans and line the pockets of the wealthy?
I'm sure he didn't care.
are you concerned that the AHCA is a huge tax cut for the wealthiest Americans?
do you have concerns about the AHCA completely eliminates the CDC's budget for disease prevention?
did you ask him why he lied that he didn't know Flynn was a foreign agent? Independent investigation. Now.
what about concerns about cutting addiction treatment in the midst of an opioid crisis?
Then he told you to vote party over country, which you will.
Unfortunately, it appears you're becoming an obstructionist to everything @Potus has promised the ppl he would do.
You live in AZ so we Ohioans really don't care what you think. @senrobportman works for us - not you
Please watch this video Senator Portman.  Your chance of reelection depends on it.
