Love Skyline too! Now to business: 1) We need a Townhall 2) We need an indep investig into Russia connection.
you know someone spit in your 3-way, right?
town hall town hall town hall town hall town hall town hall town hall town hall town hall town hall town hall. Schmuck.
people are terrified, @realDonaldTrump and his family are running the US and you jest about crackers? #TalkToUs #doyourjob
You're talking crackers while your constituents are trying to find you?  #townhallmissing
maybe we can have a town hall at skyline
so if we were able to bring those crackers to a townhall event, could we get you to show up?
your palate must be as bad as your judgement. That looks disgusting.
Crackers are a news story? Not an investigation into Trump's connection to Russia?
I'm glad you have time to savor chili. I'm worried about our unstable, compromised president and his authoritarian rants @senrobportman
Crackers are a news story? Not saving a health plan for millions of people?
This is incredibly disrespectful to all Ohioans. Why are you trolling your constituents, sir?
... 79 replies and most are calling you out about not having a town hall or listening to your constituents... WAKE UP!!
.@Skyline_Chili or maybe @senrobportman happened to mention Flynn's resignation & exactly how involved he thinks Russia is in WH & w/ 45* ?
Crackers are a news story? Not the dismantling of EPA, NEA, and other valuable services?
.@senrobportman @Skyline_Chili You're embarrassing yourself, tweeting about crackers while Russia invades the White House.
After all the  that the Deceiver in Chief did this week, new crackers top your list?!? Why did I vote for you? @CNN
If we buy you Skyline Chili, will you have a town hall in Northeast Ohio? You can't ignore us forever.
What are trying to do, relate?  You're demonstrating your utter cluelessness while the trash fire burns at the White House.
.@Skyline_Chili maybe u have some insight into why @senrobportman refuses to meet with his constituents? did he give you any hints?
I've reported this Tweet as disrespectful and offensive to Ohioans. Your Trump Regime agenda is not normal.
how about a town hall meeting at skyline chili?
Bubble-burst alert: the story of the week is that Republicans are giving tacit approval to #treason.
#coward
Listen to Happy, @senrobportman! You letting down Ohio and America.
Crackers are a news story? Not Bannin being on the National Security Council?
Crackers are a news story? Not an investigation into Trump's connection to Russia?
'Jane and me' #grammar #wherethefuckareyourpriorities 󾓬
we saw this picture last week.  Also,  not the biggest sorry this week.
*story
it IS really sorry, though
Rob Portman stands up for crackers at home and in DC. THAT'S the real story of the week.
Terrible disregard for serious problems facing us. @senrobportman @Skyline_Chili A real story = #AnswerYourPhone or #TownHall
crackers least of our problems. How about 45 Russia ties? Demand investigation & his taxes shld tell a lot
Really?  That was a bigger story than a traitorous POTUS colluding with Russia to destroy democracy?
too bad the people of Cincinatti and this country will be hurt by gutting of public schools and environmental protections.
THIS is the news of the week?? Chaos in trumpland and you're worried about crackers? God help us all!!!
Thinking your wife is probably wishing she married a man with the balls to face his own constituents!! Sad!
now you're just trolling us. I cannot believe you. Enjoy your job for the next few years. You won't win again
.@Skyline_Chili or maybe u have thoughts on why @senrobportman voted someone to head EPA who wants to destroy it?do u care abt environment?
.@Skyline_Chili when @senrobportman was there, did he mention mistreatment of immigrants or anti-muslim/anti-jewish sentiment rising in US?
did you ask the staff if they make a livable wage bring your food? #ivote
how does it feel to have contributed to the nomination of Betsy DeVos, the least qualified cabinet member in history?
Crackers are fake news! What about WH and Russia? Treason maybe? #resist #ImpeachDonaldTrump #worsethanwatergate
I live in Cinci, too. And your total silence on Trump’s Russia connections is a much bigger story.
News story of the week in my hometown of #Cincinnati? New crackers at @Skyline_Chili. They tasted fine to me & Jane! http://www.cincinnati.com/story/entertainment/dining/2017/02/15/so-what-happened-skyline-crackers/97941700/ … 
SERIOUSLY?  Russia.  Russia.  Russia.  THAT IS THE NEWS STORY IN YOUR HOMETOWN.  We aren't backwoods idiots
If you paid attention, you'd know constituents gathering weekly outside your office was a bigger story. How about a live meet
this is not a big news story.  How about a town hall?  That would be a bigly news story
is that the pic from last week?  WTF!
Actually the "fake" news of the week is that the guy you endorsed 4 president is Russia's pawn & u refuse to do what's right
The story at home in Ohio is that your constituents want to chat. How about a town hall?
@JDVance1 The good senator would do well to familiarize himself w/ media events beyond the deliciousness of @Skyline_Chili.
a repeat pander
When the rate of birth defects go up in Ohio due to Scott Pruitt and DJT, the crackers @Skyline_Chili will make it better?
what about all the constituents you ignored by selling out your votes to high dollar donors?
....Really? Nothing else was more important? Why are you in the Senate?
.@senrobportman When will you be in Columbus over recess, many of your constituents would like to hear from you? @CbusIndivisible #Ohio
Hey Rob, I'll bring you some crackers if you have a town hall. #OHDistrict3 #ResistanceRecess #TownHallTracker
The story of the week is an unhinged 45, illegal talks with Russia, & STILL your vote for DeVos. #townhall
Take your job SERIOUSLY! Are these 'NEWS'? Stop with the hypocrisy, the incompetence and represent US!
I'm not distracted Senator.  Investigate Trump's ties to Russia.  #traitor #hatriot #spineless #coward #partyovercountry
Crackers taste great with white privilege!
man up act like a senator and do town halls around the state #youworkforus
darn sorry I missed you.
You really don't care about Ohio.

when are you going to have a town hall in NE OH?
That was not the news story of the week in any sane universe. Trump/Russia? #rubberstampfortrump #kremlingate
I I don't care about the crackers. Are you going to demand an independent investigation into Russian ties?
@DSteen22 looking good in Cincinnati!
if this is joke, it falls very flat-worried for my immigrant & muslim bro. & sisters & about russian involv in WH! clueless!
Crackers, for goodness sakes? How about the natl security crisis & possible treason that you're silent on?
Are you trying to send your constituents a message? DJT is "crackers"? Surely you're not actually tone deaf?
Infinitely more important than voting on a Supreme Court nominee last year.
No Rob, that's not the hometown story. Your fear of facing your constituents is. #TownHalls #townhallforall
Sure someone in Cicny is getting screwed by the WH. That's a bigger story.
Please take a stand and denounce 45's statement about the media being an enemy of the people.
ignoring your constituents while posting drivel like this is offensive and beneath you. It will be remembered at the polls.
.@senrobportman There are many other stories we're waiting to hear from you about, Senator. How about Russian ties to Trump admin, to start?
Again showing that you can take a hard line stand on a nothing topic. Can't (won't) address impt. substantive issues Unreal.
Trump's ties to Russia must be investigated. He's a fraud, a liar, and very likely treasonous. Do something!
not funny when this is what you communicate while Trump is completely delusional. People are scared!
news story of the week?! My sense of humor is intact, but your sense of proprietary and humanity is not.
Are you having a get together over coffee on Wednesday? I don't do Facebook so announce it on Twitter too OK?
I thought the news story of the week was Russia running the White House?
News story of the week?

Portman votes in favor of incompetent robber barons for cabinet posts
I thought Flynn violating Logan Act and 45's train wreck of a presser were the big stories of the week.
Cool story. Any comment on Trump calling journalists the enemy of the American people?
This is a legitimate question, too. And silence on it says leagues. You really should issue a statement.
Meanwhile the cracker we are all worried about is speaking in Melbourne right now
Winner. Best comment.
news story of week certainly wasn't you having a townhall w your constituents
You refused to meet with us, so we're coming to you.  See you on March 4th Senator.
