WAIT!!why aren't you stating this to #45? We are watching if your words & deeds match!!!
Tell your party leadership @POTUS that. HE is the source of this uptick. #whosesideareyouon #constituentsmatter #NoBanNoWall
please share this'll with @JoshMandelOhio
Ohians won't forget the Sessions vote no matter how much of this BS you put out
fantastic! so I can assume that you'll be making a statement concerning your colleague @SteveKingIA since he is a bigot?
yet u support this administration pretty much to the T What did u think was going to happen?
I will assume then that you are demanding IA Rep Steve King's resignation immediately.
listen to reasonable hard working buckeye men and women with homes and families to protect. Maybe like Trump you will go far
I know that in my circles those representatives who oppose our president are looked upon as traitors or anti-american.
I know of another up and coming political figure in our great state who would love this position as senator. New governor too
I appreciate your statement.  The problem is the admin openly supports bigotry by supporting white nationalist views.
@SteveKingIA He's talking to you, Steve.

Does that mean you will publicly denounce Rep Steve King? Or just brush his comments under the rug?
or idiocy in the WH:  spying could have been done with "microwaves that turn into cameras"
Agreed.  Now please explain this to @SteveKingIA
Society, no. @WhiteHouse, ok?

I can only assume you are a racist and are hiding behind empty words since all you actions supporting POTUS says it all
Trump is a racist, sexist pig. Bannon is a racist. Sessions is a racist. This is your inner loop. Empty words. Lame votes.
Thank you for speaking out against the blatant racism we are currently experiencing in Ohio. Save our healthcare.
just do not confuse bigotry with security. Those who oppose the president's travel ban and border security use bigotry 4tool
Except apparently as president and cabinet members which you helped fill. Actions speak louder than words sir.
If your actions backed up your words you might have a twitter feed of positive comments. Alas, we are #NotBuyingIt
.@senrobportman so why the silence on King???
Then put pressure on Steve King to stop making ethnoracist remarks and talking about a "culture" where we all look alike!
The audacity it takes for you to act like you give a single shit about any of these people is just unbelievable
hey i know the static tv guy
What about beheadings, honor killings and sharia law ?
How can you face those kids in light of your silence about what @POTUS has said and done?  #HYPOCRITE #TRAVELBAN #PUSSYGRAB

U need to gather support and demand the removal of Steve Bannon from the WH. His white nationalist views have no place there.
we are watching you and history will remember your support of 45! Oh btw, #REALTownHall
maybe someone can tell @realDonaldTrump this
Have you told that to our President?
You condemn bigotry but support your bigoted president 100% of the time. I think actions speak louder than words.
Yet you keep supporting it with your votes in Congress. Please start representing your constituents.
I'm going really tired of your empty talk. I've written you three times on this issue and no response
Cincinnati Children's is a member of the AHA.

The West Virginia drug epidemic is reaching crisis levels – and Trumpcare is going to make it worse 
will you condemn the white supremacist comments of @SteveKingIA?

There should be no room for him in the GOP.
Tell that to the president who you blindly and faithfully follow. 
Yes, so why haven't you expressed that about Stephen Bannon?
Did you seriously include a picture of a white police man?
You helped confirm Jeff Sessions.
Wow! You really are a joke. A really unfunny one at that.
could you share that with your boss #PresidentBannon ???
You voted for bigotry with cabinet votes. Again no credibility. ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS
WHAT ABOUT FROM YOUR @potus?
If u believe this then #standuptothebully. It #startsatthetop. The #hatecrimepresident, #DonTheCon, is causing this. #standup
Explain that to your colleagues.
Jeff Sessions says what?
Again, I urge you: take this message to trump.
What about bigotry in accessibility to your constituents? We've been begging for a #REALTownHallNOW forever. #stopthebigotry
then stand up for everyone! Your silence and voting with all party lines makes you complicit to this vitriol!#Impeach45
tell that to #45. He's the one promoting this bigotry and hatred! #liarinchief #sad #trumprussia
@jackisadad unfortunately the white house, your party and cabinet that you voted for are filled with bigots. Actions count.
BOOM roasted
Really? Because your votes and support of the President says otherwise
Dude, you voted for Jeff Sessions.
except in the White House.  Which is full of them wth a in a token Ben Carson   We Don't Believe anything you say.
Except in the Presidency and the top levels of government. And among the Aristocracy. @senrobportman
the travel ban targets people based on religion, though there in no evidence that such a ban is necessary to keep us safe.
We disagree on much, but on this point we agree. I hope to see you follow these words with actions to fight bigotry in the US
You voted it into the Cabinet.
.@senrobportman Thank you, Senator. cc: .@SteveKingIA .@tedcruz
.@senrobportman Agreed! Therefore, #NoBanNoWallNoRaids  Put pressure on #POTUS & #Senate colleagues to restore American #equality #justice
Senator, you'd have to ignore a lot of the GOP to believe this  statement. Steve King, just today for example. #Trumprussia
Tell that to @SteveKingIA
I assume this to mean you will vote yes on @realDonaldTrump's impeachment?
Only if we donate enough to buy his vote. *cough Devos cough*
