I have no use for an individual that cannot understand how much damage the #socalledpotus has caused.
thank you but plz don't forget quality education & leadership.This slp will remember your stance on Election Day.
do you agree with co-signatory Sen Ron Wyden that there's a deeper DJT/Russian connection which needs investigating?

But you've done nothing to support Ukraine  (except tweet) or investigate Russian interference in our elections.
Akron
How nice for you, wish you would listen. No to DeVos.
what about more punitive measures against #Russia or simply defensive lethal weaponry for #Ukraine? @newtgingrich
we'd love for you to take some action. Answering the phones or responding to messages would be a good place to start.
How many letters, tweets, and phone calls have WE sent YOU asking you to vote NO on Betsy DeVos? #Ohio #DumpDeVos 44224
so happy to learn that you can write. Can you read? Your voters are writing asking you to #DumpDevos. Ohio schools need you!
Now tell him to sanction bff Putin.
And we delivered a signed letter to you asking for you to stand up to the Immigration EO, Sessions, and to hold a town hall.
We'd love to see some progress on these items.  Or do you need us to come back to your office?
Just got out of meeting with Sen. Portman staff where we expressed our opposition to the Immigration EO, Sessions, and requested a townhall. 
Great. Now, please listen to Ohioans across the board & vote NO on DeVos.
you ARE as ignorant as you sounded in last Tweet.  God help us. Focus: illegal Bannon, Russia, Ukraine.
oh, and his finances: taxes and separation.
you should include that DeVos bribe money in the letter if you want Trump's attention
