We are talking about American healthcare right now. Where do you stand. Remember your parties slogan America First - well?
Party's
I'm with everyone who are praying that you don't vote to take away our health care.
on a political note, Na political comments should be reserved for political post. Let's just all pray for those in hurricane
I would rather people stop praying and think - look at the evidence and science behind these stronger storms and act on it. Stop denial.
you sure these so called bigger storms are not caused from all those giant wind turbines or solar farms?
Maybe it could be from all the hot air from windbags like you blowing out stupid comments like this.
or windbags like you and your stupid comments. Works both ways. Smh. Get over yourself.
Are you also praying for those who you will leave without healthcare unless you vote no? Doubt it.
Pray for all of those who will suffer and die when they lose their healthcare if Graham-Cassidy passes. Vote NO!
I have family on the ACA. If you vote to repeal for Graham-Cassidy, I will hold you personally responsible. Vote no or resign.
Thank you.
You will be praying for a job if you vote yes on that piece of crap health care bill.
sending prayers!


I hope you introduce a bill to provide more relief effort to PR #PuertoRico #PuertoRicoRelief
You need to vote for the safety & lives of OHIO. 2.6 M have Medicaid, we have an #opioidcrisis. We will lose lives! 
#VoteNoGrahamCassidy

While you and Jane are praying pray that we don't lose our Healthcare.
So doing NOTHING?
While getting ready to take away healthcare from over 30 million Americans God bless you Senator enjoy your bribes from healthcare companies
I hope that you and Jane are also praying for all of the Americans who will lose their health coverage if you vote for #GrahamCassidy.
I hope you also use those prayers in voting the ethical way against #GrahamCassidy
Why don't you & Jane pray on whether (no pun intended) to remain in the path of that Koch Bros money or allow everyone healthcare?
How about those in the path of NO healthcare coverage?
Thousands of Ohioans have Puerto Rican roots.  Please lead the effort to send food, water, aid. Lives of US citizens matter!
Graham-Cassidy is a Category 5 disaster for people with Pre-Existing Conditions! YOU have the power to stop this storm! Vote No!
How about you pray I don't die as a Stage 4 Hodgkin's patient after you approve this preposterous #HealthcareBill? Tip: Prayers won't help!

"To date, not one major health care industry or advocacy group has expressed support for the Graham-Cassidy plan."

You're a two bit hypocrite. Pray for them while killing Americans. #GrahamCassidyBill
I'm praying that you'll vote against a health care bill that will destroy the lives of millions of Americans.
Are you also praying for the people in the path of #GrahamCassidy? They're gonna die. It'll be your fault.
Are you also praying for the millions of Americans you are about to take health care away from by voting party before country?
Also pray for everyone who will die if you pass this horrible bill.
ALL appreciate the sentiment. I C you're a commerce guy BUT HEALTHCARE IS A NIGHTMARE! #noGrahamCassidy It's NO BETTER than the last 5 tries
I hope you also are praying for your constituents when they lose their Healthcare and homes and jobs because u didn't stop an #ACA repeal.
You know your prayers aren't helping anyone! If you want to help, don't vote to repeal & replace ACA. Your constituents will appreciate it!
Children, Senator? The disabled? Oh, that's right! Koch Brothers $$! How does Jane feel about that? #GrahamCassidyِ
JUST OUT: Under Graham Cassidy ACA repeal...

-a 31% cut to Medicaid for kids
-a 15% cut for ppl w/ disabilities…
I'm praying for those in the path of #HurricaneMaria and the #GrahamCassidyBill. Damage from Maria is unavoidable; damage from GC is not.
Prayers for them but also for all those you'll kill if you vote yes on that inhumane bill...
What is your stance on healthcare? This is important to your constituents.
Just don't forget to take healthcare away from millions of Americans, that's what Jesus would want
vote for this health care bill and it will end you
Grow a spine and vote against the #CassidyGraham bill!
Instead of praying how about you listen to scientists about warmer oceans and stronger storms. How about you act rather than send thoughts.
pray for the millions that will lose healthcare if you vote yes on that atrocious bill. Country over party Senator.
Vote no on #GrahamCasiddy
America gives $700bn to the military – but says healthcare is a luxury 
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/20/america-700bn-military-healthcare-luxury … #OhioState #Columbus #Ohio
You better be praying for the people that die when you vote to take away healthcare from millions
Please also pray for those of us with pre-existing conditions, as we will all be dead or bankrupt if you vote yes on Graham-Cassidy plan.
Are you also praying for the millions of people who will lose health insurance? Vote NO Cassidy-Graham.
praying also senator. We are really lucky to be living in a society that has the awesome ability to help victims of storms.
I pray for Puerto Rico & also for my daughter with #cancer. Don't kill her & many more. Vote NO on #GrahamCassidyBill! #HealthInsurance
Yea sure pray for the people of Puerto Rico, but when it comes to voting the people of Ohio r praying u vote NO on Graham/Cassidy.
Rob might pray for you, but his party is quick to deny you healthcare. Say no rob. Prove you have a soul.
Thats so true..if u really care vote no on graham cassidy death bill..keep aca!! #ACA
I'm praying for everyone in the path of #GrahamCassidy - $9b in funding taken away from Ohio; 800k+ Ohioans w/o insurance.
Vote no on Graham-Cassidy. Don't inflict pain on your fellow Americans.
I doubt that highly. The only thing you've shown you care about is $$. You don't give a damn about actual human lives. Prove me wrong.
I'm praying for all of your Ohio constituents who will die without access to healthcare. VOTE NO on Graham Cassidy!!
How about you care about your own citizens and vote NO on new ACA bill unless you want me as a roommate.
PRAY FOR THE REST OF US THAT WILL LOSE HEALTH CARE IF YOU VOTE FOR GRAHAM-CASSIDY! #noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy
While you are at it pray for the people who won't have health insurance if this next @GOP bill passes.
please also pray on your vote and for all the patients with pre-existing conditions who depend on you to protect them
Hope you can pray for all of us on the health "care" vote in the path of the #GOP  violating the human right of #healthcare #ProtectOurCare
You need to pray for people in ohio!!if you vote YES FOR THE GRAHAM /CASSIDY BILL.!!! God help us all....
Are you also going to pray for the people loosing health care if you vote yes on Graham Cassidy? How about the prexisting condition?
That’s great. Will you also pray for the estimated 32 million people who will lose insurance if Graham/Cassidy passes?
Yes pray for everyone in the path of Graham-Cassidy bill too. Vote NO
PRAY for the MILLIONS who will lose Healthcare &1000s WHO WILL DIE LIKE MY 26 Y/O NEPHEW W/C-G bill: Seniors, Kids, Women, Pre-Exist, Vets!
SEN PORTMAN PRAY FOR HEALTHCARE FOR PEOPLE IN ALL STATES
This bill Eliminates  money for the Opioid crisis which is ravaging OHIO!! You must vote NO!!! Or all your talk about helping was a lie!
So am I. I'm also praying for the thousands of Ohioans who will lose healthcare coverage under #GrahamCassidyDeathBill What the RU thinking?
Thank you Senator. Please also pray for those who'd lose healthcare from Graham-Cassidy. Better yet, reject it so prayers aren't needed!
Vote NO for this terrible zombie HC bill, which ends any block grant to the states in 2026. After Trump cripples the poor middle class
Prayers are nice. Being the answer to prayers is better. "Please don't let our loved ones die because they can't afford healthcare."
Take a moment to reflect on climate change. Re-consider approving every science-denier POTUS puts on the table. Prepare for the future.
DONT VOTE FOR THE GOP HEALTHCARE BILL!!
Thanks . While the American People pray you don't repeal the AHCA. Pray for us too, Jane.
I am as well Senator. I'm also praying that you'll oppose Graham/Cassidy for the sake of all our fellow Ohioans.
Conspicuous silence on #GrahamCassidy .
Yet you are enabling Hurricane CassidyGraham to destroy millions of Americans lives? #sad
Mis pensamientos y oraciones están con la gente de Puerto Rico.
Prayers are good. They have mine, as well. Then, we must take action against climate change.
They get prayers from you but no financial help when they were in need. I think they'd prefer the dollars.
No prayers for Ohioans you make suffer and die with no healthcare or lose there jobs.Just as long as Ohioans taxes pays you healthcare
I'm also doing nothing to help
