bring on the vouchers! Put my tax dollars where my kid goes! Thank you, Senator!
bought by a billionaire with no experience!  You didn't listen to the people of your state. Unfit to represent us!  Sellout!
Strong advocate does not equate with informed leader!  You helped to fumble this important confirmation. #notrightforOhio
And you made it clear we will spend at least four years working against her, maybe the next 6 working against you.
I left a msg after the vote I am spending the next years working for his defeat.
work for for Senator Sherrod Brown's election!
@SenSherrodBrown is a steadfast representative of my state and my values; I absolutely will work for him.
please don't think it was a diss. I'm ready for the next battle.
You've made it clear that you're deaf to Ohioans & sold our children for 51k!! Sad, have 2 wait so long to vote against you!!
Once again Rob Portman you have chosen poorly. #blindloyalty
she will be an advocate for hedge fund managers and charter operators. Not an advocate for children. SHAME
A parent's qualifications are not transferred at birth. Shame on you. Stand up  for us or get out!
you were bought by Devos
.@senrobportman Also, her check cleared.
you seem to like to not rck the boat and follow the $$ with your votes versus doing whats best for the country.Disappointed.
since he'll sell out America's public schools for campaign donations, what WON'T Sen. Portman do for money? #portmanforsale
stop trying to defend your vote. Nothing you say can change the fact that you acted against the wishes of your constituents.
no shred of fact in that link.  You have ignored your constituents.  But your funding stream is intact for future campaigns
no amount of funding will get this traitor re-elected. Hope it was worth it!!
Does her plan play into the HRBill to close down the Dept of Education?
#sellout
horrible senator.  Sold out his constitutes!!!!!!
You made a choice.  It is on you now to monitor the situation and maintain the trust for our children.
CANNOT WAIT TO VOTE YOU OUT!
You do not represent majority in OH. Sold out our nation's children for 51K. How can u stand to look yourself in the mirror?
This ad paid for by
Unlike she did in her own state.
you should be ashamed. Destroying our nation's public education system for a measly $51,000. You are on your way out.
riiiiiiiiight
how the hell has she made that clear???You voted yes for DeVos,  sessions AND to silence sen warren- I will vote NO for you
You, along with those who voted her in, will be held to account if she does badly. #whennotif
One cannot be a strong advocate when one is so clearly not respected.  You sold our kids out.  We will not forget.
shame
once again I am disappointed in you. You are only pro equal marriage because it is personal. You vote only benefits you.
pro-trade until it might cause YOU an election https://www.ansi.org/news_publications/news_story?menuid=7&articleid=7d1cf539-76c6-4526-90a8-10beb0c4443c â€¦
How does it feel to lose the next election with one spineless vote you have taken a great step to destroying Ohio #spineless
Really?  Must you parrot Trump?  You're supposed to represent me, I'm waiting for you to do so.

@MealsLefeves @senrobportman
We said No; you didn't listen. Enjoy your remaining days in office, senator. #WeSaidNo8 #NoDeVos
are you serious?
You are an embarrassment to the State of Ohio.
How does it feel to be bought? Ohioans will remember you throwing our kids under the bus when it comes time for reelection.
how much did you get? DeVos is unqualified to serve as are you.
CTE needs to be pushed and praised. the debt of college today is crushing. Parents and students need other choices Well said
good thing you have all that extra $$ for your campaign. Gonna need it #ForThePeople #UnlessYouHaveMoney
hahhahahahhahah no.
too bad educators do not agree. Maybe their opinions matter more than campaign donations?
Congrats on your forced Retirement in 2022.
active now starting to raise money to oppose you in next election. Have lots of time to amass a war chest for your opponent!
Her history suggests she won't.
ARE YOU SERIOUS? THIS IS CRAZY! STOP THIS MADNESS! NOW! WHY ISN'T THE #GOP STOPPING THIS? DEVOS IS TERRIBLE FOR PUBLIC ED!
lipstick on a 
yeah right. She has no ties to the public education system.
and you have make it clear you will advocate for anyone who gives you enough money.
you can keep saying it but we all know the truth: she bought your vote.
if vouchers happen - it's your fault
This is a shame, terrible myopathy.
What Betsy DeVos has made was an enormous donation to your campaign. Sit down Robby
your nose is growing!!
.@senrobportman by "our kids and our schools" did you mean to say, "her own financial interests"?
she made it clear? Really? When did that happen? Ohioans won't forget. Dump Portman!!!
Fuck no she didn't.
even though she has zero experience with public schools?  This doesn't make any sense. Please explain.
also she paid you
you are so wrong!
you sold out the children for $ with this vote. Will you sell out to racism with Sessions? Vote NO on Sessions.
Betsy DeVos has made it clear she would continue bankrolling you if you voted for her, however unqualified she may be.
you could have had a partisan, qualified Education Secretary, but chose to confirm the partisan, unqualified one. Shame.
You are a sellout. Today you gambled with our children's education. In 5 years we will vote away your future  #shameonyou
If you believe that shit, I have a wall to sell you....
I thought you had more integrity. Very disappointed!
I believe your definition of the word "clear" may differ from mine. Perhaps that's because Ms. DeVos explained it to you.
I hear DeVos had 51k reasons why you voted for this unqualified destructor of public education.
you sold out for $51000. Despicable.
Need I say more?
yeah keep telling yourself that. I'm not buying it. She had made clear that she will write large checks for the GOP.
glad the $50k donation bought your vote!
Oh well, as long as she said so.
shame on you.
Looks like the going price of a vote in Ohio is $51k.
Smoke some more of whatever you're smoking if you bought that. You let Ohio and the US down.
disappointed in you! You should have abstained from the vote after taking money from her. You are immoral & unethical.
YOu are such a joke!
What in her hearing lead you to believe that?
You know she's an unqualified billionaire Repub donor. Cronyism at its finest.
DISAPPOINTED ANGRY with your #DeVos vote her lack of experience should've been enough to vote outside party line #OHVoter
enjoy the next 6 years of hell after betraying your state for a few grand!
lost my future vote....and that from anyone in your party regardless of qualifications....you know, like you all practice
No, she has not. She does not support Federal Laws protecting students with disabilities. You know that. You sold our kids.
No, she has not!  #liar #CORRUPTION
I hope you will stay attentive to her actions as to whether that promise is kept
You have made it clear that this will be your last term in office.
you're a hack
From a public school educator: SHAME ON YOU.
She's over qualified for the job. #alternativefacts 

You're weak
Surely you are kidding.
Bullshit it's on your head Portman. #unpaidprotester
.@senrobportman did you even review her record? If you did you would not say that. Shame on you choosing cash over our children's future.
being an "advocate" and being knowledgeable about public education- not the same thing
I'm sure when you are looking at schools for YOUR children- experience is highly desired.
.@senrobportman #boughtandpaidfor #businessasusual #paytoplay
your best defense was 'she is daughter of a P S Teacher'. I am the daughter of an Electrician, want me rewire your home?
the only thing that is clear is she is unqualified. And you ignored your constituents.
and you have made it clear that you can be bought sir.
You have failed your constituents. We will remember that for you money spoke higher than our children's needs.
you're an absolute joke.
You lost my support and the support of Ohio. You will be remembered as traitor to children.
she's incompetent. And you are the puppet's puppet.
I will work diligently to vote you out. Shame on you
please. That's insulting.
That's what $51,000 says to you?
biggest mistake of your career. Just watch.
you made clear that you'll soon be finding a new job
Where's your $5 million check to cover what she owes Ohio in fines.  Quit before you're impeached.
As an ohio voter who supported you, I am ashamed you would let someone that obviously awful into that position.
you better hope so. The people of Ohio will not forget exactly how easily you were bought.
I hope you're right.
hope the $51,000 donation was worth it. Prepare to be unseated next time around.
#DumpDeVos you were bought we love our children we will never forget #VoteThemOut
What did u expect her to say? Or did she slip you more payola
the count down to not voting for you in 2022 is officially on
NO.SHE.DIDNT. Literally what is wrong with you?? Can't wait to vote against you the next time your up for re-elect.
shame on you!
Sherrod Brown is a rock solid Democrat that does not waver from party lines.  We want this to continue???
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$&
you've made it clear that you'll abandon good government for 51k from narcissist billionaires.  Disgraceful.
Yeah, REAL clear.  Will never, ever vote for you again.
I didn't hear what you heard during the hearings.    Disappointed!!
Betsy Devos has not supported appropriate accountability or accreditation standards in charter schools. #NoOnDevos
So disappointed in you today Senator. You've lost my respect and my vote. I hope the $51,000 was worth it.
We will do everything we can to get your opponent elected. 
We'll remember in 2020
#TheResistance #Resistance #Indivisible
We won't forget this in six years. Hope your sell out was worth flushing your senate seat down the toilet.
@Sasa2455 At least the kids will be safe from Bears & . Learning  but Guns r the answer. FU Portman!
You voted for the worst Education Sec ever nominated. Your vote devalues public education in Ohio. Won't forget abt in 2022!
enjoy your last bit in office. We sure as fuck will remember this come election time.
You just tossed your  career away for money.  You would have been a hero if you had a spine.  The voters will remember.
And I will make things clear at the ballot box.
Good intentions are not enough. We needed a qualified Education Secretary. Many Ohio voters are disappointed.
and how much money does she owe our state, she needs to pay off her debt to us.
NO SHE HASN'T.
We know she doesn't even understand the laws you claim she'll enforce. We know she doesn't understand education. We know. 2/2
Were you watching the same questions & answers as the rest of us? It was recorded. On video. We know the truth. 1/2
She made it clear she is woefully unqualified. You made it clear money talks much louder than the will of your constituents.
.@senrobportman has made it clear campaign cash from a cabinet nominee ensures confirmation, not matter how historically unqualified she is.
How could you possibly think that?? Did you sleep through her confirmation? #Ohio
were we listening to the same confirmation hearing & appalling lack of knowledge in DeVos' answers?
she really hasn't. You should try to get as much  out of her family as you can before we vote your ass out #NoonDeVos  
you voted along party lines instead of listening to the voice of the people who keep YOU employed. Shame on you.
she's made clear that she has NO CLUE. Listen to your constituents, enjoy your $51,000
what's clear is when public schools erode you will be to blame. #SheBoughtYourVote
Her check cleared! Ha!
you could not be more wrong! You have let down our children and families! DeVos is wrong for education! #indivisible #resist
When? I want you to cite one time when she showed she gave a single flying damn about public schools.
is that an alternative fact?
I called you 7 times, expressing my discontent. Based on the comments here, you did NOT listen to your constituents.
Rest assured, we may be kept safe from "grizzlies," but the future of education in America will not be safe with Betsy DeVos @senrobportman
she's clueless. Very disappointing @senrobportman. How much $ did she donate to you?
You did not do your homework or listen to your constituents. Sad day for education.
and I've got a bridge to sell you too.....you just lost my vote - no guts to stand up for kids-you don't deserve position
Rob she bought you. How much will you get for EPA and Labor votes? Get a backbone.
weak
No. You can't make us forget her anti-public school statements and plagiarized answers.
She's made it clear she'll be a strong advocate for her own profit and you've done the same.
and you've made clear that your allegiances are to party and donors, not constituents. We will remember.
what the heck are you smoking Portman?
*charter schools. How'd you spend the $51,000?
Why do charter schools have to be for profit? If she cared about kids she would spend some of her fortune, not make more $$$
#SenatorBought&PaidFor
What she said is in conflict with what she has done for decades - tried to dismantle public education in Michigan. More lies
Senator Bought & Paid For Senator Bought & Paid For Senator Bought & Paid For Senator Bought & Paid For
Senator Bought & Paid For Senator Bought & Paid For Senator Bought & Paid For
No she has not! She has been a "strong advocate" for your bank account. Senator Bought & Paid For.
She made it clear that she's willing to buy a cabinet position. How's that $51K treating you?
are you serious? Did you listen to her answers at her confirmation hearing? UNQUALIFIED (sort of like you are now).
#NeverAgain
You voted to hurt kids! You chose $$ and party over  constituents. Voters will remember this. Shame on you!
@BetsyDeVos knows nothing about public schools. Apparently neither do you. #SpinelessGOP #MoneyVotes
