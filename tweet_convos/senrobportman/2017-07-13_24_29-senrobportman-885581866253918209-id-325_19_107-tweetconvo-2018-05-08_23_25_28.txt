You are a coward. Face your constituents and say it to our faces. We will be glad to let you know what we think. If you can't,step aside.
It's safe to come out of the bushes now, Rob and get off the healthcare fence. 45208
Then fix Obamacare. All large programs need to be fixed along the way. You know that GOP has sabotaged Obamacare by not fixing it.
We aren't stupid Mr. Portman.
Vote no. Do the hard work to bring down healthcare costs. Hold a town hall. Be brave
You don’t have enough time left in your term to accomplish your goals. How about providing ACCESS to AFFORDABLE health care for CITIZENS?
Fix the ACA
Okay its in place allready make it better
I assume whatever you vote for would be a plan that Senators would also accept as their own health plan
This bill fails on all three counts.  Work with Democrats (God forbid!!) to improve the ACA.
No you don't. This healthcare bill sucks.
Do it.  Keep Medicaid. You know we need it.
So, senator, you're voting No then? Because the current bill does none of those things.
Then work toward that goal by voting 'yes' for the bill to send it to committee where it can be changed. Otherwise your words are empty.
Senator.  Don't be Mr. Maybe.  Speak out now, Say NO.  Protect Ohioans!  Thanks.
GOP had 7 years and still have no workable plan that people accept.
Sounds like your goal won't be met by the latest bill. Maybe we can improve rather than repeal.
Please read my fax showing how to go after those laudable goals. Go after the cost centers by setting limits on the 4 main drivers:
Pre- and perinatal care, organ transplants, chronic diseases (largely preventable), and end-of-life. These account for 80% of h.c. spending.
This bill doesn't do that
Move everyone into the FEHBP for 5 years and repeal O'Care #promisesmadeandkept
You had better vote no or it will be the end of your career.
It's called Single Payer
Ding dong the bill is dead, The wicked bill is dead!
Why do I really hear "My goal is to continue to ignore my constituents and tweet nonsense"?
Your goal is to pad your pockets as always
Great! Three vulnerable Ohioans are my siblings with Down syndrome #NoCutsToMedicaid
Protects everyone
I like how that sounds, but I don't believe the current bill will achieve any of those ideas
Hope you'll vote NO on this bill and work with those across aisle to fix the issues you see with the current system.
So you are not supporting the bill you've been working on? Great news. Because it is not going to do any of the stuff you want.
Face your constituents or step down and do some other job. Cowards not wanted.
If that is truly your goal, then you must vote no on the disastrous #trumpcare. Stop the horrific and deadly Medicaid cuts
But stealing money from the hard working middle class through 300% premium increases is justified? Give me a break. Communism = Death.
Great to hear! The BCRA doesn't do any of these things. Can Ohioans count on you to vote NO @senrobportman  ?? #SaveACA
Then urology saying voting no...
Unfortunately, many, conflate insurance with quality, affordable care. They are not the same. Best solution focuses on care, not insurance.
Describe "the most vulnerable" & how an insurance policy provides for quality affordable care. You are just working on insurance not care.
Well, the latest version doesn't do that. It cuts benefits; that doesn't address rising costs. ACA is NOT a "Cadillac" plan !!
So that means a NO vote, correct! Anything else is a death bill. If you vote yes, you can kiss your dear goodbye, Senator!
The new GOP Senate bill would NOT provide access to quality care or protect the most vulnerable.  Please oppose if you value Ohioans' health
so you are letting the abuse of able bodied adults on Medicaid to continue?
Then you should vote no on the proposal brought out yesterday!
Then vote NO for this bill.
I hope you mean that.
Really? Is that really your goal? Then don't vote of the new GOP healthcare bill.
Vote no
The BCHA does not provide quality care, abandons the most vulnerable and does little to lower cost of coverage. Vote for Ohio & against BCHA
Then vote no on #BCRA. $45 billion is not enough to combat the opioid crisis. I'm from 44224.
Where does the constitution give you the power to "create" this?
And affordability?  Access already exists. As long as you have the money you can get all kinds of care. The point is cost. The point is cost
#Billion Medical #FRAUD and @SenatorMenendez ALSO Helped a #Doctor with  #FRAUD & is Still In The #Senate ? #WTF Kick His ASS OUT NOW #USA
I am your constituent, and I am terrified of the new bill. Please vote "no."
Then you should be in favor of a single-payer system w/ a mix of public & private providers. That is most effective at achieving your goals.
If you truly want to protect the most vulnerable, you must vote no on the current version of the #BCRA!
I join my voice. If you REALLY want to protect the most vulnerable - you MUST vote no on GOP bill. Otherwise - just empty rhetoric.
It’s absolutely shameful that politicians want to keep access to more health benefits for themselves - but not for the people they work for.
The bill in front of you does none of those things. Reality is, fix the ACA.

So you know deep Medicaid cuts don't work. PCMH, ACO models improve outcomes, lower cost for Medicaid patients. Vote NO.
Vote no Rob. Your consituants are counting on you!
This isn't it!  Lives are at stake!
Well this doesn't  do it. Go back to drawing board with Democrats, do it right.
so where are you hiding this great secret bill?.
So you'll be voting against the Senate health bill!  Thank you.
@senrobportman please remember people with disabilities
Great. Then you will need to start by standing strong and voting no on the disastrous proposal that is currently on the table.
What causes high cost of coverage? High cost of care. Start there.
Have you forgotten the Republican
Party Platform?

https://www.facebook.com/JeffersoncountyOhio …
Tip: The most vulnerable is POC, children, women, preexisting conditions, and elderly. NOT THE RICH <3
What a coincidence that's the goal of the bill you are repealing
Then do it.  We voted you in to get Trump's agenda passed NOT YOURS and definitely not Kasich's.  If you don't - you are part of the swamp
You didn't have the guts to vote no on Betsy DeVos, vote NO on healthcare. Voters remember
Then vote no.  Millions get booted from health care if ACA repealed.  To help the rich?  Have a heart!
Government needs to stay out of our insurance
Total repeal
Thank You Senator!
Please don't pass the bill then. Tell your compatriots to start over thinking of their constituents rather than insurance companies.
They've thrown you a bone with the 45, but this does not create a sustainable system. It's a NO.
That sounds like a "no" on the current bill. Great! Thanks!
Then VOTE NO. BCRA does none of these things. Listen to your constituents. 45040
Why are you exempting your own?  Try what you're planning for us!  Shameful!!
Serve Ohioans--Vote NO BCHA!
Have you read the #CBOScore? #BCRA exacerbates all of those problems & is cruel to boot! #KillTheBill #trumpdontcare #ProtectOurCare
Portman is a traitor to wealthy tax payers everywhere. How dare he align himself with people trying to freeload off the backs of the rich!
Oh good. Glad we can count in your no vote then since this awful bill won't help you meet your goal.
What about pre existing conditions?
Then the proposed bill is not in line with your goal
Please vote no and, instead, work with ALL senators to create bi-partisan revisions to ACÁ. I'll keep calling, tweeting & emailing!
Then hopefully your head and your heart will guide you to VOTE NO on the latest version of Trumpcare. Your State is counting on you!
Way to stand against this nonsense when few of your colleagues will!
How about universal healthcare-no insurance-save 50% of healthcare costs by eliminating profits, marketing & lobbying costs, CEO salaries
fabulous sounds good Counting on you Thank you for putting  country before party, don't know how others will sleep at night. #Killthebill
This ain't it.
Regardless of what your boss #Putin says.
I think playing hospital administrator and insurance company by Washington DC is a REAL bad idea.  Tyranny is bad... always
Fraud.
Im skeptical Rob. How can congress fix it?  it can not!  the bill should allow private parties and states to make own laws.
Like Medicare for all? Single payer? Or improving the ACA? Anything less is not good enough. Don't repeal, improve!
Vote no, if you really care
Then vote no please. Trumpcare does not protect the most vulnerable.
Then you must vote NO on the current healthcare bill! Please work across party lines.
From Sherrod: It’s shameful that politicians want to keep access to more health benefits for themselves but not for the people they work for
IS  SENATOR PORTMAN MEAN, NASTY, & GREEDY. If he's voting for Trumpcare he is. How many Ohioans will die because of his mean, nasty greed?
Then you must have decided to vote no on this terrible bill that raises costs for older, sick, disabled and poor Americans.
But do you even know the needs of Ohioans since you will not have a town hall.
So you're going to endorse Medicare for all? Great!
Then your stand on the BCRA should be a hard no and not "we'll see."
Then vote no because the GOP's plan does NOT protect the most vulnerable in Ohio!!
You've had decades to figure this out...but instead block all ideas proven to do these things...kinda sounds disingenuous
Then vote NO on this bill, walk across the aisle and work with ALL your congressmen and women to FIX the ACA not just burn it to the ground.
So vote NO on this reworked BCRA (the Bad Coverage by Republicans Act). It's even worse than the original!
The Cruz-Lee amendment takes us back 10 years to No Coverage for well child checks, No Coverage for vaccines, No Coverage for mental health
Thank you for your continuous advocacy for our children's wellness @ccgrahammd!
Vote no #Nocutsnocaps
Have the courage to vote NO. Ohioans will support you
As a Democrat, I hope everyday that I made the right decision in voting for you. Please don't hurt Ohioans to give rich people tax cuts.
If you want to keep your job,VOTE NO on the horrendous healthcare bill your colleagues are trying to ram down our throats
Medicaid must be maintained 4 adults with intellectual disabilities
Call R. Portman at 1-800-205-6446 or 614-469-6774 Provide your first& last name and zip. Use manners let him know your concerns. #Trumpcare
Vote no - this bill does offers little toward your goals.
Well this bill won't do it Senator. Doesn't take a genius to see that.  For example, you exempt yourselves from some provisions. Why?
Please #VoteNoBCRA #NoTrumpCare #workwithdems ! #SaveMedicaid
We haven't seen that bill.  Instead, the Senate bill will destroy Medicaid and the individual market, and maybe damage the employer one too
The current version of your bill doesn't accomplish these goals. You must vote no.
Cut Medicaid...and vote for health care Change.  We cannot afford to support putting everyone on the government dole!!!
Now you are on the right track but let the consumer pick which plan or plans offered at the most affordable price! Do not FORCE down throat?
The current bill doesn't do any of that.  Even with the concessions, it'll be a failing replacement.  Think bigger and  bipartisan.
Vote No!
Please be candid and admit that is not going to come from the Republican Party, but only through bipartisan action. Surely you know that.
I hope you mean what you say and will put the Ohioans you were elected to represent above your party. No on BCRA
Hope you continue to vote no on this terrible, job killing, healthcare bill.
Then fix ACA - don't tear it down!
Is "most vulnerable" a euphemism for unborn? How are you addressing OH's abyssal maternal morbidity rate? Defunding #PP will kill women.
Does "access" mean if you don't want Ins then don't get it? Go to ER if sick?
What does "access" mean? What does "most vulnerable" mean?
Oh! So you've already decided not to vote for this bill since it doesn't meet any of those goals.
Then you must vote no on this bill, Senator Portman
I don't think you are listening to your constituents! Plenty of good doctors here could advise you on how to create this system! #townhall
give congress the same HC plan as the rest of America ! Not good enough for you=not  good enough for the people you serve
plz keep in mind pushing high costs medical care patients into high risk pools is not protecting your most vulnerable.
Since the bill hasn't changed I will assume your vote hasn't changed. Vote No!!
please define "access." I have access to a whole lot but cannot necessarily afford it.
Sounds like you are trying to vote for this disastrous plan. It will not help the most vulnerable. Please vote NO.
If that's true then you need to vote against the bill. It does none of those things and makes things sig worse for everyone but the rich.
I can see why you're struggling considering you've only had 7 years to figure this out.
Medicaid bull is Obama giving it to everybody not what it was intended for


No, your goal is to not take a position and hope it doesn't come down to you. Shame on you.
Not believing that.  You want to give tax cuts to the rich.  Period.
Protecting the most vulnerable means keeping expanded Medicaid.
Protecting the most vulnerable means guaranteeing coverage to those with pre-existing conditions.
Protecting the most vulnerable means not blocking payments to Planned Parenthood to provide care to low income women.
No one can disagree with this goal. And that is not the issue. What you and Senator McConnell cannot or will not tell us is HOW.
It isn't what was released today, that sucker stinks to high heaven. #fixtheACA #fixtheACA
Not just the corporations for the win, Senator, your constituents need quality medical care.  Don't sell us out. #Ohio
My goal:stay alive w A pre-existing condition & not end up in the poorhouse. why did .@SenateGOP exclude themselves from #trump2pointNO ?
Vote NO and then vote to guarantee CSR payments.
Then VOTE NO on this bill!  Take care of Ohioans!
This bill ain't it then.
This plan isn’t it. Walk your talk, Rob!!!
So WORK On one!  Don't push through this one sided, quickly thrown together bill. I'm in your district...don't do this!
Fix ACA!
Well this bill doesn't do that, so I guess you're a no?
If you truly mean that then fund ACA adequately and add a public option w/cost controls. works everywhere else. Say no to Mitch for once.
UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE! 44060
Excellent. I'm glad you are voting 'No' on the #Trumpcare bill.
Then you should vote against the AHCA which does none of those things.
So that means you are a firm 'no' on this terrible bill, correct?
This bill does none of those things. Please work across the aisle and fix the ACA or work toward a single  payer system.
Please #VoteNo! Bill still harms the frail elderly/disabled for whom #Medicaid originally was created and need it most.
So we'll work with Democrats to tweak the ACA, rather than throwing the baby out with the bath water?
Get rid of Obamacare! Insurers are pulling out & healthy young are subsidizing the  people are being forced to subsidize the sick and old!
I believe you may reach your goal w/ a bipartisan effort to repair ACA. Voters WANT Congress to work together, find common ground, achieve
The entire Republican Party is engaged in a massive coverup operation of a President engaged in Treason.

Pass it on.
your goal is to see which way the wind is blowing..it did not escape us that you said "no" to the last bill after it was already lost..
Then please vote no on this horrific bill.
Then you must vote against this terrible bill #ProtectOurCare #healthcarenotwealthcare
Please be aware if you vote for this bill you will never be reelected in the state of Ohio. Stand with us.
Lowers cost for whom? Provides access for whom? Protects which of the most vulnerable? Whom will be hurt by this bill?  #MedicareForAll
What does that mean? Maybe you should host a town hall face to face opportunity for your constituents to discuss.
Rob thinks lower the cost of coverage is more important than providing coverage. His plans will strip benefits from the insured.
Those low quality plans will mean deductibles too high for most people to meet.
But the insurance companies like them so much they gave Rob $382,000.00 to promote them and a combined donation of $433,000.00 to all GOP.
The low quality plans will be pedaled to unsuspecting people who will find out when sickness strikes that the plans are worthless.
Rob Portman helped craft this bill. Rob Portman is not good for Ohio. Vote Rob Portman out of the US Senate.
That sounds nice. However the goal of your party seems to be tax cuts for richest, not healthcare. This is horrible:
CBO: Trump budget would NOT reach balance in 10 years, would see a $720 billion deficit in 2027. WH had claimed $16B surplus in 2027.
So you plan to vote no? Because this bill makes everyone more vulnearable. Please Senator... stand up against your craven party.
Make sure to express this in your actions, after these words.
It seems there is a consensus here for you to vote NO. Please listen. Fix, don't replace the ACA. Vote NO.   43821   #countrybeforeparty
So basically the opposite of your current bill.
How about working toward something that works better for everyone, including the most vulnerable?
@senrobportman Are we to interpret this as a "no" vote? Please do the right thing and say no to the BRCA. - Your constituent (44141)
