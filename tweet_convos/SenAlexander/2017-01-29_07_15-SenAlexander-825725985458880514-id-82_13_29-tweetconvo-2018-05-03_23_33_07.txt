@SenAlexander Please. No. Completely unqualified. As a mom of a special needs kid, and she has no idea what IDEA is, terrifying.
I call bullshit
Where? she has no experience.  She is a wealthy woman and should just push her Amway products.
@SenAlexander @memphisnews repeating a lie doesn't make it true. #factsmatter #DumpDevos
@SenAlexander @memphisnews these are #alternativefacts they are not #facts
@SenAlexander @memphisnews this is utter BS. I will give money to anyone who runs against him in 2020!!!
be honest: advocating for charter schools.
WRONG.  she is unqualified.  A vote for yes shows that money can buy GOP politicians.  #wearewatching  @GOPHELP @memphisnews
She ruined Michigan schools. Shame on the GOP
.@GOPHELP Anyone wanting to contact @SenAlexander about Devos, Sessions or other, read this for helpful info.
CALLING YOUR REPS!! HOW TO DO IT EFFECTIVELY! Long but you only have to read it once. 
no way. she is unqualified.
@SenAlexander @memphisnews http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/betsy-devos-education-trump-religion-232150 ….  NO exp in public ed; takes taxpayer $$ from pub ed to fund religious charters.
separation of church and state??? Nope the donations they gave overrule this. Smh
THIS MUST BE A JOKE & IS A BLATANT LIE. She is completely unqualified. Is this article just more #alternativefacts?
She does not even know proper grammar, How can she help? Never saw someone so unqualified for a job.
Vote against Betsy DeVos. Every teacher in this country has far more experience & education than her.
@SenAlexander @memphisnews Giant lie, but you be you Sen. Alexander.
he is determined AF to vote yes regardless of what the voters say. His $ ties are bigly
@SenAlexander @memphisnews you would be wise to listen to the concerns and complaints about DeVos from the residents of Tennessee.
She's unqualified. As a crony appointment, it will reflect badly on Republicans who vote for her. Rethink this vote.
@SenAlexander @memphisnews  Confirm & u will anger millions of IEP moms. As an IEP mom I can say, we are tougher than grizzlies.
Senator, She is not qualified. No to Betsy DeVos!
Are you getting me?  She's been advocating to steal money from the neighborhood schools.  No to DeVos.
Syrian refugees are more vetted.  And more qualified for EdSec. Ditch her now Senator.  Get ahead of history here.
@SenAlexander @memphisnews   Lamar's not listening. $$ in his pocket. But say it anyway.......She is an awful choice! #nojob4udeVos
I hope the others do @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @SenatorTimScott please do the right thing
@SenAlexander @memphisnews rich kids maybe
Devos has been sucking money out of public schools to line her pockets. She's bought and paid for all of you and you should be ashamed.
@SenAlexander @memphisnews My daughter pays tuition for my grand girls to get a Greeneville City School education. Vote No to DeVos
@SenAlexander NO to DeVos
@SenAlexander @memphisnews She has NEVER TAUGHT IN HER ENTIRE LIFE.
@SenAlexander  she has ruined her districts. Not qualified and Uneducated.
"Dedication to education" LOL.  ZERO TEACHING EXPERIENCE.  We are DONE here.  NEXT
@SenAlexander @memphisnews if you vote her in Lamar. Public Education Teachers & Parents will vote you out in Tennessee
@SenAlexander @memphisnews   NO, totally unqualified candidate.
BS
@SenAlexander DeVos is grossly under qualified and unprepared to lead the education policy of this nation.
@SenAlexander @memphisnews Listen to the teachers of Tennessee. They do not support Betsy Devos. Neither should you.
I call BS! Look at what's happening in MI schools because of her lobbying and Snyder!! #NOdevos #resist
@SenAlexander I have fostered over 50 kids with IEPS. If you are willing to sell education, powerball winnings big $$
@SenAlexander I have Public School experience and with IDEA plus a powerball ticket nominate me and I will donate 2 u
You're a putrid coward, staying silent while the White House tramples the rule of law.
just stop, she's not qualified,has her own agenda that is not good for the nations education system, don't approve
@SenAlexander @memphisnews FALSE
She knows nothing about education
Williamson County has one of the best school systems in the country. Michigan, not so much.Look closer to home.
@SenAlexander @memphisnews Bullshit- no other word for it
Help #GOP find a moral compass! #NoBanNoWall
@SenAlexander we vote no!
If there is a worse choice for education secretary, I can't think of a living one... Dolores Umbridge?
@SenAlexander @memphisnews meanwhile Alexanders phones and offices are stormed by his constituency from both sides who disagree.
this woman is as unfit to serve PUBLIC schools as any candidate ever.  disappointed in Alexander.
@SenAlexander @memphisnews  Before advocating for DeVos, check performance of the "better schools" she has supported in Michigan.
Also note she has managed none nor have her own children attended any of them or any like them.
Putting children first?  No, she is putting for-profit schools first.  She is a disgrace to education.
Betsy DeVos has never even held a job!?!?!?
sir as one of your constituents I continue to urge you to vote no on DeVos. She is not qualified both R and D agree
@SenAlexander @memphisnews what reality do you live in look at her record not voting for you again
DeVos has hurt our public education in Michigan!! Vote NO!!
@SenAlexander @memphisnews Listen to yr constituents which includes me! Vote NO if u are not a disgrace 2 yr office.
@SenAlexander Mr.Alexander, why aren't you listening to your constituents? DeVos is not qualified. Period. We do not support this.
@SenAlexander @memphisnews senator, I will not change my mind against her and you just lost my vote for the next election.
@SenAlexander @memphisnews No. She will ruin our good Williamson County Schools.
@SenAlexander @memphisnews If you won't listen us, listen to the kids https://www.facebook.com/AFTunion/videos/10154534444179160/ …
SHE HAS NO EXPERIENCE
shameful!  This woman bought her appointment. We shall remember you for this!
What are you hoping to accomplish with this tired party line? We've spoken.  Time for 25th amendment.
.@GOPHELP @memphisnews
@SenAlexander @memphisnews Senator, quit lying to us. You know the truth, she is not qualified.
This is what the GOP is advocating.
This is what you tweet about this morning? Petty.
no no no. She is bad for education. I am sure the only support she has is from those (like you) she has given funds to.
@SenAlexander @memphisnews DeVos will destroy public education for generations. Ignorant, uneducated, unprepared, religious zealot
@SenAlexander @memphisnews ..the system is not perfect.. but she's clueless about our public school system..square peg & round hole
@SenAlexander @memphisnews She DOES not advocate accountability for charter schools!  Where did my tax money go??
She created travesty in Michigan...proliferation of charter schools of astonishingly poor quality competing for kids w/ ipods
Strong public schools help everyone! Privatization helps only the privileged few! NO ON DeVos! #DumpDevos
There is plenty of evidence that school choice does not lead to better outcomes. NO ON DeVos!
