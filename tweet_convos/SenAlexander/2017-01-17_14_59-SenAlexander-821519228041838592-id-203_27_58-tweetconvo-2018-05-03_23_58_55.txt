.@SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump @usedgov nominee @BetsyDeVos is uninformed, inappropriate, unqualified
Profiles in Tremendousness
she hasn't so far and can't answer any questions?  A pathetic choice
@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump @usedgov @BetsyDeVos she donated 200 million to Republicans.She knows nothing about pub school.
With guns. To fight bears.
You're doing a disservice to the future of America. This is more important than politics
She's unqualified and an embarrassment.
@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump @usedgov @BetsyDeVos
@NancyPelosi  Our children's public education is to important #nodevosdrainswamp
NEGATIVE. She fights to move public funds to private hands. that is WRONG.
@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump  @BetsyDeVos only if  forefront ur talking about is on tracks in front of a speeding train
you really think @usedgov schools will be safer if @BetsyDeVos allows guns on campus?
LOL She's ignorant as hell, no experience, has destroyed public ed in Michigan.
@SenAlexander  You guys are so out of touch. It's #embarassing listening to your views. This women is totally #unfit.Shes RICH
She will not. She'll help gut public schools like she did in MI. KY kids deserve more.
I dunt no wut yu mene. I went two publik skuls.#RussianPropaganda
Now I KNOW you're crazy, old man
@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump @usedgov. @BetsyDeVos is unqualified for any Cabinet position. Stop the donor masquerade.
why should taxpayers fund for profit/religious driven schools?
, @usedgov - DeVos does not have the knowledge or experience needed - listen to hearing, it is evident.
bullshit and lies!
- right! $ talks -billionaires stick 2gether! And 'we the people' suffer!
Betsy DeVos is cancer to the education system.  She has no experience with public education and could not answer simple ?s.#CountryOverParty
She sure didn't sound like she knew anything about education during her hearing.
What MAJOR legislation have YOU submitted In your LIFE!! Nothing!!
@BetsyDeVosRepublican mega-donor with ZERO experience should not be in charge of American Education.
@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump @usedgov @BetsyDeVos This is serious. Our kids lives R at stake. DeVos is a total incompetent.

@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump @usedgov @BetsyDeVos including disabled kids?
Since when does @GOP care abt any1 ?Flawed DNA.Hell Mitch voted against his own miners.They lose ins when he repeals O'CARE. judgment coming
She does not understand the difference between growth and proficiency.  #clueless
@ 'usedgov' appropriate enough for you lot of Fascists, destroy public ed.
@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump @usedgov @BetsyDeVos she is completely unqualified to lead  Dept. Ed. $$ can't buy everything.
@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump @usedgov @BetsyDeVos How much money has the DeVos Family given you? Put the our kids first!
Lmao is this a joke?! She doesn't know diff between proficiency and growth!
COMPETENCY, ETHICS, & PUBLIC SERVICE are the qualities missing from most cab appointees.
If physicians had same competency level that DeVos has for her job, many Americans would be dead already.
you're a liar just like Putin's puppet Trump.
@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump @usedgov @BetsyDeVos are U listening to the people? We see she is not the one.It's embarrassing
@SenAlexander @usedgov @BetsyDeVos 
She knows nothing about education other than how to make $ off the backs of poor children.
Based on her hearing last night, woefully unqualified, unless $$$ = qualification.
@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVos 
You seem thrilled to cut children w/ disabilities off medically & educationally!!
@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump @usedgov @BetsyDeVos 
She doesn't know what IDEA is!!
She is not competent.
#VoteNoOnDeVos
@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump @usedgov @BetsyDeVos she supports having guns in schools. This is unacceptable!!!!!
you wish to support a Fraudulant person to oversee trillion dollar budget . Shameful
@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump @usedgov @BetsyDeVos she couldn't say guns don't belong in schools.  That's frightening!
her 990s for 14 years have been FRAUDULANT? She was just on tv during hearing saying so!
This women has no business running this department. Americans are watching. UNFIT.
Right.  So long as that expansion is Christian and supports her ideology.
She is dangerously unqualified and must not be confirmed.
This woman is a joke! As your constituent, I strongly recommend you to block her nomination.  #Unqualified
@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump Sen. Alexander I am a proud public school kid, grew up next door in AR, appalled by @BetsyDeVos
@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump @usedgov @BetsyDeVos what about kids with different religious beliefs than yours?
@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump @usedgov @BetsyDeVos what about minority kids?
I think you were watching a different thing from the rest of us. #unfit
Who the hell are you trying to kid? All you want to do is privatize.
@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump @usedgov @BetsyDeVos did she contribute $ to U?Children r precious deserve better than Betty
Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! Wrong pick!
On the + side, she's the least knowledgeable of all Trump's cabinet picks & least likely to  understand the dept she'll ruin.
@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump @usedgov @BetsyDeVos  Unless they have disabilities of course. That hearing was a joke.
Mitch.  Did you actually watch the hearing.  @BetsyDeVos should not be confirmed
her only qualification is her giant donations to Drumpf and your committee
she is not qualified, and brought the position.
@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump @usedgov @BetsyDeVos she doesn't even know Basics!!!;growth vs proficient!!! What is this?
awful!!!!!!!!!! No way!
what makes you think she will do so good? Perhaps the MILLIONS of dollars she donated
Wake up. Totally unqualified!
how much money did she give U to back her? She lacks credentials! She's just rich. SAD!
American children deserve much better than Betsy DeVos. No no no Devos
@RandPaul JCPS schools really are deplorable. Drain the JCPS swamp!
.@realDonaldTrump's pick for @usedgov, @BetsyDeVos, will fight "to expand #education opportunities for children" http://bit.ly/2jkIi9X 
Devos needs more thorough vetting by the Senate. Pushing through without proper clearances will end up hurting our country
oh really "bitch tits Mitch?" This video would show otherwise this is not alright
Sen. Al Franken discovers Trump Education Secretary nominee Betsy DeVos doesn't know the difference between proficiency and growth. 
My pet hamster is more qualified. Cut the shit and do your jobs. Reject these cabinet picks.
All nominees should be cleared by the office of gov't ethics before receiving a hearing.  Follow your own guidelines hypocrit.
No b/c she is out of touch w/ parents, families & communities and public education.
No. She won't. She sadly does not know anything about #publiceducation
She doesn't know the difference between proficiency and growth?  Basic!
Devos has no experience running an agency.  Being nice and rich is not a skillset. Extend her hearing we need to know more.
@SenAlexander she is so wrong for this job, and we need more info.  Obama noms had prequalifications. #DeVosHearing
@SenAlexander she literally wouldn't answer the question on protecting public schools. Nice lie though.
@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump @usedgov @BetsyDeVos NO trust someone who has not turned over ethics forms!She is not viable.
@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump @usedgov @BetsyDeVos She will expand the opportunities for RICH children.
@SenAlexander @usedgov @BetsyDeVos We don't need more choices.We need to improve the public school system.
Like making sure we have a gun in the classroom to kill Grizzlies? #INCOMPETENTCHOICE/DISGRACE
THERE SHOULD BE GUNS IN SCHOOLS BECAUSE OF THE GRIZZLY BEARS WTF
DUDE WHAT DOES RUSSIA HAVE ON YOU THE WOMAN FOR EDUCATION IS BUYING THAT JOB TO MAKE OUR SCHOOLS CHURCHES
@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump @usedgov @BetsyDeVos she's nt an educator, ed leader, no knowledge of pedagogy/curriculum
There I fixed it. @BetsyDeVos
has failing charter schools in Detroit. NO, she has absolutely no business near Educ.!
What Am saw tonight was a vicious display and attack from the cretins of the Left
@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump @usedgov @BetsyDeVos Liar
YOU LIE! She's only fighting for voucher $$ for Christian schools #SayNotoDeVos
@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump @usedgov @BetsyDeVos clarify "whose children." From her record: only certain kids matter.
No she won't unless they're rich and privileged
@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump @usedgov @BetsyDeVos bs
#SenatorAlexander deserves a medal for courage under Fire this hearing.
@SenAlexander  @usedgov @BetsyDeVos  she'll fight to expand private schools & provide nothing for public schools!
@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump @usedgov @BetsyDeVos devoss puts religious views & charter mission to subjugate at  forefront
She is an unqualified double talker. The swamp is now a bubbling cesspool.
@SenAlexander Including children with disabilities? Because I'm hearing she says NOT providing accommodations s/b an option.
@SenAlexander This is a travesty..Listen to our nation's teachers . Are u going to rubber stamp just to earn pets with Trump?
She puts rich kids first!
She has no experience!
@SenAlexander  @BetsyDeVos Education isn't about making a profit for the school owner. Adjust your priorities for the future.
I think devos was really a priebus. No way trump picked her.
Her's is an admiration for public education as spectator vs warrior @SenateMajLdr @SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump @usedgov @BetsyDeVos
no experience other than dumping millions of dollars in the pockets of our politicians
A Sea of Charter Schools in Detroit Leaves Students Adrift
.@SenAlexander What happened to #draintheswamp? Education is too important to turn over to an anti-labor billionaire lobbyist non-educator.
@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump @usedgov @BetsyDeVos in what way? What color is the sky in your world?
@SenateDems @SenAlexander  to all the GOP members on this committee. May the OGE shld ck
@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump @usedgov @BetsyDeVos Prove it. Where is her paperwork others had to file

@SenAlexander @realDonaldTrump @usedgov @BetsyDeVos 1) In who's world, this woman is an uneducated privileged scum, she is
2) poised to destroy the education system that has taught us for decades,

Keep your religion off my eduction.
http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/betsy-devos-christian-schools-vouchers-charter-education-secretary …
No, she won't.  Like you & Donald Dump, she'll only be furthering her own interests.
Her religious beliefs do not belong in our public schools at ALL. #SepOfChurchAndState
has NO experience in schools! That is like electing a Prez #TRUMP w/ NO exp in Politics!
you can see how well that's worked out for America so far. #duhNewAmerica
.@SenateMajLdr @usedgov @BetsyDeVos Now do you REALLY believe that means ALL children, or are we just talking rich WHITE children?
@PattyMurray 7. accountability measurement scale 8. other options & PS equal measurement
4.Workwith 181days5. funding tied to test results? 6.teachers Paid by results what about districtsw/high 90%diversity
(Christian children)

Not so, both my husband and I worked in education she is the last person education needs
I didn't realize rich kids had it so hard!
keep religion out of public schools and don't use tax dollars for funding religious schools please & thank you.
not charter schools
I feel like @SenateMajLdr hasn't researched @BetsyDeVos at all. She just fights for white, rich, christians kids.
she has ZERO experience with public schools. Big GOP donor family tho 
Why did the students in the Mi charter schools that Mrs. DeVos led perform poorly when compared with public school students?
how about govt fucks off and minds it's own business
http://www.freep.com/story/opinion/columnists/stephen-henderson/2016/12/03/betsy-devos-education-donald-trump/94728574/ …
quit lying, she's not interested in that. She wants to divert tax dollars to religious schools
Something @BetsyDeVos has failed to do over her entire professional lifetime.
Thx to @BetsyDeVos, MI has some of worst performing charter schools, devastating ed. outcomes.
Maybe we are after the wrong guys taxes. American ppl should FOIA his taxes
