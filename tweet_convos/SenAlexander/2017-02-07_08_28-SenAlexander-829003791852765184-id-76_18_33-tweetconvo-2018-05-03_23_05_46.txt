Betsy DeVos is not qualified.
Dang Buddy. Stop with the shinola already. TN hates when you lie, fabricate & forward Falsehoods. Sux
oh lord your arguments are an example of trumpocrisy
You insult all educated people with this vote. and the children they are trying to serve. please vote no.

"...who has never set foot in a public school classroom. Ok, maybe for a visit once." You're a disgrace.
She is massively unqualified and is simply buying votes and destroying schools!
no this is fake news. She is an idiot. #NoonDeVos #holdthefloor #TheResistance #StopDeVos
you are wrong. No on DeVos!
those are #alternativefacts you've just doomed our public schools with the most incompetent & ignorant fool
some children. Assuming they're white and Christian they meet the min req for her help.
Senator, I faxed your office in opposition to DeVos. How many others did as well? Can we see a tally?
NO SHE HASN'T!!
You should be ashamed of yourself. You voted party over children. #noDevos
laughing as I read above quote.
Senator Alexander, do you read the emails, texts, or tweets from your constituents?
No. I think we should VOTE HIM OUT. I AM PRINTING THIS OUT FOR YOUR NEXT CAMPAIGN.
.@SenAlexander @BrianKelsey Really tho? I guess ya'll just equate giving money as giving life huh?
.. You're so Dam Delusional if you believe that Bull!!
time to come home and take some questions senator. Your constituents have some for you.
Give it up, Lamar, we will never believe DeVos is qualified because she is not. DeVos has made a lot of money out of education
Are you kidding me? Seriously?  That's like hiring a director of maintenance that's never held a broom!
The Educators I know and respect beg u to VOTE NO.
Wrong!  Vouchers pay for a bad school. You'll pay big out of pocket for a decent school.  By by Betty
Not the right person! GOO filled with more qualified
she is not the right person for this job. The children deserve better.
.@SenAlexander .@BrianKelsey with #DeVos this will be the future of K-12 #education. #USSenator #MarcoRubio say NO
She is a fucking billionaire Christian bigot who has no business in our government.
more alternative facts? Shame on you.
DeVos only qualified if U want private schools. Rural USA doesn't have that choice. DeVos terrible for our KIDS!
obviously you can't hear us calling and emailing and faxing. This is ABOUT OUR KIDS!  #noDevos
@skrug75 @BrianKelsey @Tennessean It would be nice to hear more about her selflessness. Can you share?
@rareliberty @RandPaul @Rare PLEASE VOTE NO ON DEVOS! #NoOnDeVos WE Will REMEMBER HOW YOU VOTED!
NO!!! She is a seemly nice lady who doesn't know a damn about education. She has NO EXPERIENCE. STOP $$payback
@skrug75 @BrianKelsey @Tennessean please Sen. #VoteYesonDeVos! We need new ideas and a fresh look at schools
Give it up Senator! We're not buying it.Obviously your voting for her. Start packing immediately!
Woops! Obviously YOU'RE voting for her.
Unless they have a handicap.
you maniacs. I'll commit to never voting for a Republican again in my lifetime if this vote is yes.
Someone who's only experience is in opposing public education, is not qualified to oversee its future.
How much did she pay you to say this? You mock educators who truly ARE highly qualified with this drivel!
Betsy DeVos is unqualified and had no business as SecEd or in the President's cabinet. NO PAY TO PLAY
Please represent your voters, not your campaign donors. #noDevos
.@SenAlexander @BrianKelsey Respectfully, in addition to endorsements please release data on calls received. At least those who got through.
ridiculous lies!! The public has watched her hearing. We know she was not able to answer basic QU
His record in Memphis makes him an expert?  He literally has stated that Georgetown is Communist

Both of you are hired to #FightForTruth for #ThePeopleOfAmerica! All People. Just look at your retweets/Likes @cnn
please don't destroy our education by confirming devos.

just stop DO THE RIGHT THING you forget middle America with DeVos #NoDevos
I've been asking teachers in TN and they are overwhelmingly  against her.
the only winners in DeVos Detroit charter school crusade are for profit charter schools #NoOnDeVos
She will gut public education and turn it into a BUSINESS. NO
statements like this fool NO ONE & is why you will lose next election #bought #corrupt #establishment
I respectfully and thoroughly disagree and would be eager to discuss Mrs. DeVos lack of qualifications with you  @BrianKelsey
NO! She is NOT qualified at ALL. You work for US
You can Tweet this over and over but it doesn't change the fact that we told you NO and you didn't listen.
This does not change the fact that she NO experience- ZERO, NONE, NADA- in education!!!  Your words mean nothing
Really Michigan schools are wrecked by Devos
question - have any of you seen her work in Detroit? Bad unregulated charter schools on ever corner.
.@BrianKelsey $5400 for one editorial. nice cash if you can find it. How much more did she give you in prior years? @SenAlexander
.@SenAlexander any chance you can find ANYONE that says something nice about her that is not in her pocket? you seem to be struggling...
she's not an "education leader" she's not an educator & she's not a leader #NoonDeVos #shame
she want only the top kids educated and the rest can have the crumb
she has not "given her life" she's given part of her inheritance. This is an insult to real educators
