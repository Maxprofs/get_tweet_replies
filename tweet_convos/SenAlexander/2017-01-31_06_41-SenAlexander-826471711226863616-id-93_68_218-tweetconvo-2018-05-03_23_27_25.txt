Rethink it.  Are you a beneficiary of her donations?  You know it's WRONG
You have failed the children of SC. #noDevos #AllMeansAll #sheisunqualified #ImYourEmployer
she plans to take the money from title 1 schools...the poorest schools... 17 pages worth in SC alone
and that private schools
is defending @BetsyDeVos on @cspan rn, received $49k in campaign $ from her fam - aka $2k more than new teacher salary inSC
No wonder the American people have lost faith in government,with incompetents in the driver's seat!
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos @postandcourier and you should be ASHAMED of that. You sold IDEA and our children.
are u supporting just bc it's a GOP pick? Doesn't seem like her background match the job
.@SenatorTimScott @SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos @postandcourier Rather than spending time retweeting, please answer your office phone & listen.
most of you just don't want children from the other side of the tracks in your schools
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos @postandcourier this will haunt you at election time. Hope she paid you enough
, happy,  congratulations  BDeVos.
because she donated you $50000. Makes sense. You don't care. All about money.
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos @postandcourier she is UNQUALIFIED. Period. Shame on you for not fighting for our children
. @SenatorTimScott Looks to me like people are paying close attention here.
Worth noting @votetimscott received $49,200 from DeVos family, was a keynote speaker at DeVos AFC summit last year: https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education/news/2017/01/12/296231/conflicts-of-devos/ â€¦ 
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos @postandcourier Thank you. Now support Sen Sessions for AD NOW!!
Then you are a craven fool who prioritizes money over our children.
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos @postandcourier This TN voter says NO to de Vos
mmmmmm I disagree
continuing to defend yourself doesn't work. We made up our minds. You ignored us. #shameonyou
Wow no one is for DeVos. I believe you are a good person but wrong on DeVos
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos fantastic; so will YOU tell disabled children that you turned your back on them? You just did!
charter schools have a noticeably terrible performance rate. Anyone who endorses them is clueless or looking to profit.
great to know you dont care about the people that voted for you or the students in public school #wearefucked
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos @postandcourier So you believe a public school administered by her would be effective?
That's what you're asking the American people to be ok with.
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos @postandcourier no backbone, retirement is awaiting you.
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos @postandcourier Shame. You fail our kids and our future if DeVos is appointed.
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos @postandcourier former Miss Teen South Carolina is more qualified
do you want her to teach your children plagiarism!
No. You received $50K from DeVos. Be honest about your vote. You're bought and paid for.
She will harm our schools. Knows nothing about public education. Has no experience. #noDevos
Your vote is a disservice to every parent whose children attend our public schools.
it's obvious that the fact that our state is home to the corridor of shame means nothing to you. SC will remember this.
#NODeVos #BigMistake #endlesscommoncore #nochoicewhenallschoolsCommonCore
ask Detroit how school choice worked out for them.
looks like he is not listening to his constituents
No!!!!!!
Sen Scott, Pls be honest & just say you support your wallet, not American children. Disgrace.
You have failed us.
Very disappointing. Like @LindseyGrahamSC, you shamefully do not speak for your constituency.
sad day #wompwompwomp #recalltimscott
Bad decision, Tim.
Thank you for supporting American children & turning around our failing system, Outstanding 
You may lose my vote for this confirmation, senator.
Enjoy all of Betsy's bribes. Didn't think a good South Carolinian could be bought
I pity you.
you are misled & are making a mistake in voting for Betsy DeVos, unqualified and conflicts of interest.
Prez couldn't find a QUALIFIED person with a school choice agenda?
Block her at all costs!
Unqualified, wrong on school choice & on grizzlies.  Worst nominee of a very bad bunch.  Voters will remember.
Ridiculous
Admit it, she bought your vote for a lousy $50,000. SHAME ON YOU! Don't think we'll forget this. @postandcourier #noDevos
You can support school choice without supporting cronyism.  Please reconsider.
Sen. Scott, I would strongly ask you to reconsider your vote on this. Supporting DeVos is clearly wrong -- and you know it.
.@SenatorTimScott @BetsyDeVos @postandcourier Pathetic but not surprising given the $50,000 you've accepted from them.
You can't get fired! Stand up for the kids. YOUR STATE in particular needs better education!
Yer a good man Sen. Scott.  Please tell your Dem colleagues to stop playing politics w/security
do you ever vote with your conscience or is always with your campaign coffers...
.@SenatorTimScott @BetsyDeVos @postandcourier This is absolute bullshit, and you know it.
That money trail is shamefully easy to follow.
how does it feel to be in the back pocket of some rich people...
You are a Fool for supporting that woman...
must be easy to ignore your constituents when you dont have children to throw under the bus....
You no longer have my vote.  I am so disappointed in you.
people of SC @SenatorTimScott cares more about campaign donations from @BetsyDeVos and friends then your kids education. Pathetic Coward!
Betsy will be tremendous in her cabinet post..based on the vitriol coming from the DNC!
your public school in Charleston County is ashamed of you today!!!!
Look's like someone put money over principle...#shame
How much did she pay you to say this? #DumpDevos
And she will make sure our kids are protected from random bear attacks, too.
I do not support devos, I do not support devos, I do not support devos, I do not support devos
SHAME on you for supporting this grossly unqualified and anti-education candidate. #weseeyou
I'm disappointed in you, Senator Scott. SC needs qualified leadership in education.
- you were bought, how pathetic!
So #wrong to put #GOP over  #country. And in this case over #children.
YES and double YES!
