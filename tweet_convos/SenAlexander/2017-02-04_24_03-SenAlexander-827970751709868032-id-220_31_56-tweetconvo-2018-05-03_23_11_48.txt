so of all these 50 states, there is still not a majority supporting her! #noDevos
...and a soon to be former TN Senator. Your constituents do not want DeVos sir. You've literally NEVER been more wrong.
liberalism is seriously dysfunctional.
conservative Hypocrites are turning into the normal!!
i am as normal as they get. Take yourself else where.
.  Not Going Anywhere!!!   Say it then Own It!
shut up. You're an angry gay bc i exposed how gay is normal got to America. Deal with it!
From my early childhood learning, "It's right to do right, even when it seems right to do wrong." Don't blindly follow.  Lead!
@MIBATS @MMFlint @BadassTeachersA  DeVos is only a leader in privatization, not education! Hedge funds win!
https://www.facebook.com/AFTunion/videos/10154558789469160/ …
thanks for nothing Lamar.
So, that means the majority of state governor don't support her. #DumpDevos
Betsy dismantled Michigan's public schools. WRONG FOR CHILDREN!
.@SenAlexander @MittRomney @JebBush How much did she contribute to your campaigns? Can we buy your vote, too? #GoFundMe #BetsyDeNO #NoIDEA
Point is? People voted in an unqualified tv celebrity bad business man who has 50 lawsuits in WH #NODEVOS
@BetsyDeVos is unqualified too. How soon until she has lawsuits as well? #countryfirst #noDevos Hear us!
@BadassTeachersA  Lamar, how much has DeVos donated to you? She is NOT qualified and hates public schools! NO
The senators who voted against have 36 million more constituents than those who voted for. #resist
no on devos. She is not qualified. #TheResistance #holdthefloor #NoonDeVos #StopDeVos
VOTE NO
partisan politics for another 4 yrs.  Congress has done nothing for the citizens during the past 6yrs SAD
Her Goal more Charter Schools?  Make Public Schools All as Good.  https://populardemocracy.org/sites/default/files/Charter-School-Fraud_Report_web.pdf …
and that makes her qualified ?
No to DeVos
please vote NO for DeVos. She doesn't understand IDEA & http://Fed.fund  equal private v public & proficiency v growth
In the clown parade that is Trump's cabinet noms (excpt Mattis), DeVos is the grand marshal. History is watching senator
OUR CHILDREN DESERVE BETTER THAN DEVOS. YOU USE THEM AS TOKENS TO EXPERIMENT ON WHILE YOU MAKE$ #NODEVOS
does not matter if Tennesseans are not supporting her. Please actually represent your voters in TN
Anyone supporting her doesn't need to be in office
Neither of these are Tennesseans. Betsy DeVos is not qualified. Quit pushing her on us. No to DeVos!
U say folks outside educ have been in charge of educ for last 30 yrs. Hows that workin 4 you?! NO DeVos!
too bad you constituents don't. Maybe you can get the votes if those 22 governors and Mutt and Jeb.
If we had your money and your morals, we might not give a damn who was sec'y of ed either! DeVos UNQUALIF
Our children need strong public schools. That won't happen with DeVos who diverts money to charters.
no to DeVos!!
Yet the citizens of the US overwhelmingly oppose her. Will you ignore your constituents?  #DumpDevos
she's not fit. Vote no
To use an old saying, if 22 state governors jumped off a bridge, would you?
you work for the people of America and more specifically your constituents, though.
and where do those states rank in level of education?  TN is embarrassingly low.
This is not the electoral college. 22 is not a majority.
Omg! THEY'RE TENNESSEANS? I never knew! 
Oh, I see, then.They're teachers&principals? 
No? Then, wtf?
Your constituents are your employer, not 22 Govs. You've seen unqualified=chaos. Please VOTE NO.
your peoples opinions matter. All I've seen is NO to DeVos. #wearewatching
so, there are 28 state governors opposing her?
so because others are doing it it makes it ok.  If everyone is jumping off a cliff will u follow them as well?
Did she give them money too?
vote no! Check supporters of DeVos net worth see why they support her. Also check campaign contributions
#disappointed IN ALL OF YOU!#DumpDevos HOW CAN U SLEEP? @TrumpPuppet #wrong #bad
50-22=28
I've taught for 40 years and know when something is right and she's NOT RIGHT!  Yup she gave you money!
#DumpDevos
So 38 govs oppose her? Govs like state control of schools, as DeVos advocates. She is wrong for Sec of Ed (I'm a TN resident)
Supporting her based on her $$ contributions...I see what you're doing here.
you  JOKING, she knows nothing about education, given LOTS of money to Trump. Vote NO if you care
.@SenAlexander @MittRomney @JebBush You know 22 < half right? Is this your rationale for going against your constituents' will? #noondevos
22 idiots
@PoliticsK12 @MittRomney @JebBush there are 50 states so 28 don't.
So that makes it right?You work for us, your constituents. Those people are irrelevant. Grow a spine and represent your state!
@PoliticsK12 @MittRomney @JebBush history will judge you harshly.
Listen to your public school teachers! We are in the trenches EVERY day!
There may be 22 governors in support of her but how many teachers? 0 is the number.
that's not a majority.
WeThePeople don't support her
and literally everyone IN EDUCATION is against her.
Please support Betsy! We need competition in our schools and the freedom to choose which schools our children attend.
What a joke. Just no. You know this. Don't be fools.
22 is fewer than half of 50, just sayin.
which means more than half of them do not. Your constituents are telling you no.
@PoliticsK12 @MittRomney @JebBush Respectfully I disagree."No mandates for anything"-including state adherence 2 IDEA.#noDeVos
noooooooooo!
, I don't care about those people, I just care about you as my representative & I don't want you to vote for her.
I I want you to vote no on Betsy DeVos. She is not qualified to serve as the education secretary.
it's rare to have 98% negative replies to a tweet. you need to vote no on DeVos
Lamar, vote as if your career depends on it. Bc it does #IsIt2018Yet #Resist
that doesn't make it right. You have all compromised what values you had #resist #noondevos
And 80% of your constituents do not support her! #YouWorkForUs #VoteNoBetsyDevos
campaign contributions!!!
this concerned Tennessee citizen does NOT support DeVos #wearewatching
Worse education secretary nominee EVER. Unprepared for hearing, UNQUALIFIED. TOO BAD THERE ARE 50 states
I passed my test to be highly qualified. Devos failed her test-her hearing- failed miserably.
If I have to take a Praxis test to be highly qualified so does Devos.
I'm a teacher. I'd make a great Sec of Edu. At least I've worked in public schools
You are not representing 22 governors. You are representing the people of TN who are saying no on DeVos.
Those governors are obviously clueless about what educators do.
Forced indoctrination of narrow religious opinion upon children in the schools...is CHILD ABUSE!
Same S whose Chief of Staff distributed child pornography.  Now he supports abusing children in schools
Do your state a favor @SenAlexander and let a more sensible conservative voice represent Tennessee.
only 12 likes and many more opposition tweets, ARE YOU LISTENING do you need a stat lesson?
so Lamar...with your logic 56 senators should be opposing DeVos and she should not get voted in.
22 Governors should also worry about their re-election. Listen to the people. She is UNQUALIFIED.
Supporting DeVos is denying FAPE and an education for poor, rural communities. No Vouchers!
Do you listen to your constituents, Senator?! No! No DeVos! Check your calls.
along with an apparent majority of governors,your TN constituents think you are wrong. #NoDevos
And if Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush supported jumping off a bridge, I suppose you'd...?
the people who hired you, the Tennessee voters, do not support her. Represent us.
what about public school teachers? In Tennessee alone the teachers who asked you not to support her outnumber those governors.
That's irrelevant. Your desperation for the wholly unqualified BVD's appointment is unnerving.Your constituents say no.
And none of them are your constituents. But I am. #noDevos
well I wonder how many of them also have her listed among their campaign donors?!
why aren't you listening to us?  Your constituents here in Tennessee want a qualified Secretary of Education. DeVos is not.
@PoliticsK12 @MittRomney @JebBush and who on that list of politicians has benefited from her campaign donations?
so 44% of governors support her. Doesn't sound like resounding support
This is a terrible decision for our nation's public schools. Did she contribute to your campaign?
@PoliticsK12 @MittRomney @JebBush I'm a school board member in Murfreesboro, TN & I oppose DeVos, listen to your constituents
@PoliticsK12 @MittRomney @JebBush thankful the hearings were on tv so I could see every minute. Woefully unqualified candidate
she did not even understand IDEA is not a choice. Basics!
Did ANY  send their kids to public school? Did you? You will be held responsible for this crazy pick.
you've sold out Senator. Betsy DeVos policies will only make system worse for most of your constituents. Shame on you.
Hes same senator whose Chief of Staff distributed child pornography.  Now he wants DeVo abusing school children
Last I checked, 50-22>half of 50. You have MINORITY of governors! #BadMath #DumpDevos @MittRomney @JebBush
.@SenAlexander @PoliticsK12 @MittRomney @JebBush that means a majority aren't supporting @BetsyDeVos !!
@SenBobCorker Please ask teachers across your state before you vote.
@PoliticsK12 so you're saying the majority of state leaderships oppose @BetsyDeVos?
then they are as delusional as you are because it would be hard to find someone worse
@PoliticsK12 @MittRomney @JebBush not a majority, kinda like Trump's popular vote
@PoliticsK12 Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush are not references I would want on my resume.
@PoliticsK12 @MittRomney @JebBush That means 28 oppose her...
but the people who voted for you and who you represent do not!!
@PoliticsK12 @MittRomney @JebBush have her teach a model lesson, assess for rigor and differentiation
#NoOnDeVos
You've had a good political career and have done well by TN. Don't blow it at the end.  No to Devos.
Sir, I do not. I am disappointed with your decision and will have to seriously decide whether to vote for you again.
How many of them have experience/knowledge in education?
I'll be donating to and supporting your opponent if you vote yes to Devos. #educatedTNvoter
how much money did she give you?
& how many TN educators Senator?  How much $ would they need to pay you to be heard? Provide amount #bought #establishment
would you encourage a person with no experience to fly the plane you're on?  Absolutely NOT!!
SAD!
well the people of TN DON'T. You know, the ones who elected you?
of course Engler does. he tried to bust the Detroit PS Teachers union; pushed charter schools in MI.
mega DITTO
all Republicans. She donates to Republicans. Coincidence?
I have immense respect for Sens Collins &  Murkowski. History will support them.
22 state governors paid  by her ?
Just because the other lemmings are jumping off the cliff doesn't mean you have to take our children too!
? @JebBush & @MittRomney were not TN residents the last time I checked.  #outoftouchwithconstiuentsonthischoice
That's less than half. Or according to @realDonaldTrump math, a landslide.
Betsy DeVos is unqualified for the position of education secretary.
all bc she bought their support! You all should be ashamed. Definitely showing that DC only cares about 
This is not a fact or a piece of evidence to appoint her. They are all on the take, just like you#nomar
tea party puppets
You work for us, not them.  Tweet as much as you want.  It doesn't change that.
DO NOT SUPPORT DEVOS!
You want to talk numbers? How many Americans  have spoken against DeVos? #democracy
What do you know about eduction??
Your voicemail has been FULL because the people of TN oppose Betsy DeVos.  Why are not you listening to the people, senator?
Obviously money is more important than children's education and future since she paid all of you off
.@SenAlexander doesn't care what we think. Don't forget, @SenBobCorker is up for re-election in 2018. Your constituents are watching you.
Yes, but how many of your constituents support her? Tennesseans think she is unqualified and you work for us.
and how many of these candidates has she helped bankroll?
great an all, but you sir, should not be one of them.
.@SenAlexander If 22 state governors jumped off a cliff, would you jump too? Following the crowd isn't always a smart choice. #parenting101
Listen to your constituents instead of your lobbyists!
STOP this nonesense- this woman is UNQUALIFIED. period. shame on you for insisting otherwise.
There money can't buy you Love or votes! They will NEVER FORGET!!
Tennessee will not ask THEM who to vote for when your name is on the ballot for SURE!
So that would mean 44% approve and 56% oppose. (Public schools teach real math, not alternative facts.)
how many public school teachers support devos?
So!  They never had their kids in public schools and they are not highly qualified !
You can stop now. Tennessee does not want DeVos. No matter how many other rich politicians support her #listentoyourvoters
No one wants her other than the elite she donated more than my yearly salary for. #StopDeVos #DumpDevos
and that being said, you have reached the wrong conclusion on her suitability for the position. Vote no.
Not real hard to find 22 idiots in this country.
right - because she is a longtime donor.  Not qualified.
Because she gave you all money???
Then one of you can hire her. But educators--qualified to evaluate her credentials--don't support her. We deserve better leadership.
CONFIRM DEVOS!  We need REAL CHANGES in Ed system!
Their opinions do not change the fact she's unqualified, & her hearing answers were evasive & inadequate.
what bothers me is that you have not listened and feel secure that you will be re-elected...we will not let this be forgotten
That doesn't sound like something that backs your support. Only 44% in case your calculator isn't handy.
CONFIRM DEVOY!
so the opinions of 22 governors outweigh the opinions of thousands of TN parents and educators? Get your priorities straight.
Why are you ignoring the voices of your constituents? They are against this nomination. #DumpDevos
People with more vested interests in our public schools tend to disagree. She's an awful choice.
This could determine your next reelection. Is she really THAT qualified? Are you willing to bet your job on it?
so by your own math more (by 6) governors don't support her.
Lamar hates our children and wants to destroy their education in favor of his religious dogma.
So your saying your a follower and not a leader. #NotMySenator #DEVOSNOTQUALIFIED #SUPPORTPUBLICSCHOOLS
Tennessee Voters do not support DeVos. #RiseToTheOccasion
now let's see a list of actual K-12 educators supporting Devos. Specifically TN educators. Where's that list?
Would they be, uh, Republican governors, marching in lockstep with you & other DeVo$ recipients?
you are choosing to ignore those that elected you this is NOT a Democracy!
Just proves you are all corrupt and don't care about our children! Shes Unqualified
Not surprising. They all have bad records on education. #DeVos is unqualified by any measure.
What about teachers & Superintendents? Can you list any in support? Those voices matter. Vote No on Devos
#BETSEYDEVOSNOTQUALIFIED #SenAlexanderNotQualifiedforTN #DumpDevos
Listen to your constituents!!!!!
How much did she pay them?
Romney $5000, Bush $8100
#soulsarecheap
