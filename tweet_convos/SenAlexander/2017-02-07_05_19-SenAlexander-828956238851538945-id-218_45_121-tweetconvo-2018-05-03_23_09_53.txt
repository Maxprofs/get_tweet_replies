very sorry about this
how stupid can one be to spend $200M to get a $200k a year job? Almost as stupid as those that support her!
As a Tennessean, I am no/ feeling very proud right now. With your history in education you know how unqualified DeVos is. Wow!
this Nashville  TN conservative public school Mom is very disappointed by this news.  She is an awful choice.
current father of 2 TN public school kids says 'DeVos is unfit to lead ANYTHING'. Stop this madness Senator.
#selloutAlexander #noDevos
And Sen. Joe lost his mind 10 years ago as everyone in CT knows. @JoeLieberman
Time will tell.
you're an embarrassment who hasn't listened to your constituents
Have you asked yourself, "What if I'm wrong?" Our children & their education is not worth the gamble.
that's almost laughable....#NoonDevos # NoonSessions, #NoonBannon,#NoonGorsuch
I have contacted your office regarding Ms. DeVos' nomination. I still have not received your due diligence on the matter. Help
"caring" about children isn't enough. I care about children too, that's why I oppose her.
#$$$selloutchildren
I will never vote for you again
If I had $200M in disposable income, what cabinet post would I purchase...

@SenBobCorker I've advocated for his education for years. If that means taking it to D.C.,I'll do it. SPED parents fight.
as a special educator I am horrified by #Devosbuysposition. Her brother supplies mercenaries #no
@SenBobCorker I literally just cried on the phone to Corker's tri-city office. Why? I have a son with Autism.
I taught spec ed for 20 years and she will take it back to the dark ages not eligible for help.
Betsy DeVos cares about for-profit education, doesn't want to hold schools up to a federal academic standard. #RejectDeVos
they do not want to have to fund special education, since they think they will not "contribute' to society.
Betsy Devos will fail our students and we will have your job for it. You will pay for this.
Quit trying to justify this. You made your bed. You lost my respect. You lost my vote. The end.
do u always do what Joe tells you to? Be your own man, do the right thing and fight for TN instead of being Trumps pawn
Primary him & vote him out. We have enough lap dogs in Congress now. He obviously does not care about pub schools
and every teacher across the US cares about children!  Signed, A 38 year veteran of both public and private education.
I couldn't be more disappointed in you senator.
the American people don't agree.
that's a lie and you know it. She couldn't even handle the hearing, how will she do the JOB? #NoonDeVos #DumpCorker #DumpDevos
you have failed the children of America. Shame on you!
You must realize at this moment you will not be voted back in office after this. You have failed your state, sir.
I've called, emailed, written postcards, and even this piece for @HuffingtonPost. STILL IGNORED!  https://www.google.com/amp/m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_588b594ee4b0020b224b43c2/amp?client=safari …
why are you avoiding us Senator?  I explained in my request that you may have given this a cursory review.
Sir, it is clear you don't care any more for children than you do for your constituents desires. We will see you at the polls.
it's official. You are senile. Enjoy retirement.
He's not senile. He's been corrupt 4 yrs. He enjoys making $ 4 himself while throwing TN under the bus.
oh yeah and somehow he keeps getting reelected, but TN voters firmly against DeVos will remember this one!
The only reason she got the position is the money she donates to the GOP.  We will remember in 2018 and vote you out. Traitor.
vote no one Devos.Not qualified.
@JohnJHarwood Former Sen. Lieberman should be ashamed of himself
Too bad she has absolutely no public school experience! #VoteNoDevos
Then you need to listen to more people than Former Sen Lieberman. #Devos doesn't care about children.
Your're WRONG. keep dragging that dead loser of horse . As an ed sec you should really be ashamed of yourself.
only the top kids and fu** the rest
I respectfully disagree. She may care about some children but I am not convinced of her dedication to #PublicSchoolSuccess.
I disagree with Lieberman this time. She came across as having the brain of a Barbie doll.
Lieberman, nothing more to say from Connecticut.
just stop
vote NO on DeVos!
DeVos does not have the experience to lead American education for our children.  Please put them first.
you represent the people of Tennessee not Lieberman. We say #NotoDeVos!!!
@JohnJHarwood #ConfirmDevosIsBadChoice
@SenateRPC That is a total lie and u know it. Shes not qualified at all. Vote no.
OPEN YOUR EYES. VOTE NO.
caring isn't the same as being prepared. I care about national security, but you don't see me vying for Secretary of Defense.
@JohnJHarwood Gag.
#TN AND THE COUNTRY HAVE SPOKEN OUR CHILDREN DESERVE BETTER #NODEVOS
@JohnJHarwood I don't believe that the fmr Sen is one of your constituents. What does the TN ed community think? #NoonDeVos
#DumpDevos
You have one last chance to listen to the voters of Tennessee instead of #partybefore country. We will not forget!
Take it from the guy who developed TNReady which literally never worked. He knows about education, folks.
you should be ashamed of yourself. You know that she is unqualified. Karma is a b#tch and she has your number. #NotoDeVos
she is unqualified, the people of Tennessee do not want her, our children can not afford her, vote NO!!
Your phone has been busy. @SenBobCorker staff was very polite. As a constituent of y'alls, I completely disagree @JohnJHarwood
@JohnJHarwood That's a steaming pile of BS & you know it. Lots of people care about kids. Doesn't qualify them as Ed Secretary
@WilliamJBennett Sen L is a man of courage n character. He's a dem but I agree w most of what he says??? I wonder why???
When the history books are written, you will be not be treated kindly I'm afraid. This POTUS is dangerous & so is DaVos.
@JohnJHarwood she is not qualified, come on. The american people deserve better than that.
In other news, people who favor religious schools (including orthodox Jewish schools) like DeVos.
@JohnJHarwood Senator you are a spineless hack!
@JohnJHarwood DeVos plagerized on her senate questionnaire. Let that sink in for a moment.
Lieberman cost Gore the 2000 election (as well as Florida's hanging chads) and is no longer to be listened to.
obviously doesn't care at all about his constituents, & even so looking to Lieberman to support his wrongheaded vote is absurd
@JohnJHarwood HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Senator Alexander cares only abt money, and the proof is how he's throwing children under the charter school bus
give 1 fact supporting this nonsense! Opinion is not fact she doesn't even know what IDEA is nor an ARD #NoDevos
In what universe? How much did that cost DeVos? Shame.
@JohnJHarwood I care about kids.  That hardly makes me qualified.
@WilliamJBennett fresh eyes are needed in all bureaucracies.
@JohnJHarwood    Both of these guys are fossils.   Get them out
I work with children and she would be terrible.
DeVos lacks a basic understanding of public school education. She has bribed her way to this point. #NeverDeVos
I care about pandas, but have no clue how to care for them. #VoteNoDevos
Just one of many poor decisions you're making as stooge to Bannon/Trump.
with all due respect Sir, it is clear that your vote has been bought and paid and you are not listening to your constituents.
Cares for children there are children in Detroit who sit on crates, not chairs. How much did she pay you?
Bullshit. Ask yourselves why all teachers are against her? Think for a change, please!
Lol. I've known it 4 yrs, but it looks like ur constits. have awoken 2 ur corruption. U will reap the poison u have sown. 
She wants to destroy public education and you know it. It's ok, we are watching and will vote you out.
you are awful
Wow, I'm appalled at the way you ignore the outpouring of opinion against DeVos.  I'm not hearing many in support
In other words "she's definitely not qualified to do this job but she's my friend so..."
Tennessee educators and students always give 110% please sir ask if they truly deserve DeVos
twitter needs to add a "dislike" button so @SenAlexander knows just how outnumbered the current 38 likes are by DeVos doubters
.@SenAlexander your TN constituents disagree respectfully. "Caring about children" is not a resume booster, it's just a given. That is, duh.
But sir she had no experience as an educator and her only experiences as a student and parent is with Charter schools.
NO NO NO ARE YOU LISTENING
@SenBobCorker #VoteNoDevos or we will all vote no on you! Our kids matter more to us than you do
- no to DeVos. How does she care about children? Does she have any experience with  children from poverty?
Everyone knows #Lieberman is a turncoat. You say his name and things become a comedy. #DumpDevos
This is outrageous. Why appoint an unqualified billionaire? New gilded age? SHAME
Current Higher Ed Admin E. Rose says Alexander "won't be getting re-elected in 2020 after this one!"
"Caring about children" doesn't equal qualification for Sec of Education. She has none! #DumpDevos
Voters are watching, and we know when our voices are being ignored. Our kids & schools will pay the price for your politics.
Well if former Sen. Lieberman says it it must be true I guess. We will not forget this Senator.
Well, then, he would be wrong.
Listen to your constituents. We DO NOT want Devos. This will cost you in 2020. #noDevos
One former senator vs. thousands of your constituents, @SenAlexander. Stop trying to justify your vote and do the right thing.
@jwyarnell @SenAlexander shape up son! I went to bad TN public schools. It ain't right.
how will she help my developmentally delayed child.
you should release the numbers of people who have called/emailed your office about her and the % who do not want her confirmed
the committee vote you led was a sham and so is she. Shame on u for choosing politics over our kids.
#NOONDEVOS!
She might care abt kids, but that doesn't mean she's qualified for Sec of Education. Please vote #NoonDeVos. For our future.
you were elected by the ppl to LITERALLY DO ONE JOB- represent your constituents. Epic fail, way to follow th $. You sickbv
Very rare to see 100% negative replies to a tweet. You need to vote NO on DeVos.  #noDevos
I also care about children, doesn't mean I'm in any way qualified to be secretary of education #AnyonebutLamarr2020
vote no. Vote no. Vote no. No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no.
Why is Lamar so pro-DeVos?
also: "she was nominated" and "she is rich!!! Rich people like her!" Tennessee says NO to DeVos!!! #listentoyourvoters
ladies & gentlemen our senator bought by DeVos. Money and power has blinded him to the utter incompetence of DeVos. #noDeVos
#VoteNoDevos
Trump has found his yes man. You will never do whats best for this State. Just vote yes to everything.find your backbone
Are you even listening to your constituents? Time to remove you from office. #noDevos
no
Your constituents want you to say NO to DeVos. You are a representative NOT our leader. Vote how your people want you to vote
Hell, I care about kids too so maybe I shoulda been nominated for SECED. #HowLowCanYouSetTheBar
you're days are numbered if you honestly believe that.
Are you even trying to listen to your constituents?  Please address their concerns instead of quoting Joe Lieberman.
Don't listen to a thing J. Lieberman says from Connecticut.
@SenBobCorker if you don't listen to constituents...
well that's obviously an alternative fact.  Wish you were willing to stand up for our children!
<<---Let's All vote him OUT for the sake of Tennessee's children.  #noDevos #education #SpecialEd #DisabilityRights
How can she be ready without actual educational leadership experience? There are qualified candidates who do. #VoteNoDevos
tell your constituents how much money it would take for us to buy you back. #crookedmoney
I was wrong about you. You have no heart.
many of us care about children. That doesn't make us qualified for this position. Vote no. She's not qualified.
Her lack of experience is a slap in the face of public educators.
I too have called:  no to #DeVos. Bad for TN learners. Bad for TN educators. Good for your donors' taxes. #bought #corrupt
she does NOT care about the children. But I guess you don't either. Sad
DeVos is a threat to education system & is not qualified for the job. Your support of her shows you choose party over country
that's nice, but his kids don't go to public school in Tennessee like your constituents' children do. Who are you working for?
this is your legacy, Lamar. Realize that and don't ruin it, because it's fading fast.
No...do not confirm her. Listen to your constituents not the money lining your pockets!
As parent, researcher, & elected School Committee member, I am so disappointed in your partisan, reckless decision.
caring doesn't make you qualified.
It doesn't matter how much you repeat that malarkey, she's not qualified. Vote no.
"cares about children" is the weakest argument. She is EXTREMELY UNQUALIFIED and your constituents want you to #VoteNoDevos
@SenBobCorker
@SenBobCorker
CRONY Capitalism will light a fire under us that voted for YOU. No DeVos
Just called your Knox and D.C. office's, leave a message?? Vote NO. NO DeVos! Can't you stand up for US??
If assignment were to match incompetence with a disdain for public schools, then, sure. You're convincing no one, Senator.
Yes to DeVos is like taking a homeless mans blanket. TN pub schools are already hurting. This is unsult to injury. #VoteNo
Seriously Lamar??? Lieberman is Betsy DeVos' bagman, a paid servant. How much is she paying you to ignore voters???
Stop what your doing and LISTEN to what your constituents say to you. That is YOUR job. NO to Devos
NO.
this is ridiculous....please vote no!
She cares about money and making a profit off of hard-working Americans who can't afford private school..who will lose FAPE.
why won't you release # of calls, emails received from constituents demanding #NoDeVos?
No--she's not. You are using a false argument, appealing to authority. Ask professional educators. Ask your constituents.
- @BetsyDeVos isn't ready to take on this assignment. She has never even given an assignment to a class of students. Vote no!
vote no.  #BetsyDeVos has zero experience in public education.
I disagree. Will no longer vote for you. #NoDeVos
, you are wrong this time. Put kids first!
then why are thousands  of teachers, liberal and conservative, from all across the country opposed to her? #teachersknow
@SenBobCorker you sell outs?  Ask yourself Why you became senators? To make a diff?  Your constituents will remember. #NoDevos
- I don't care what Lieberman said; he probably took money from her family. Have you taken money from her family?
I've tried calling your DC office and your #Chattanooga office several times. It's either busy or goes unanswered.
I'm completely against #DeVos and am disappointed you're voting for her. If 50% of Senate votes no, isn't that concerning?
I care about children, too. That does not make either of us qualified to fill the position. Vote no!
@SenBobCorker I would really like to be proud of you.
- your constituents don't want her. You work for us. Do your job or you won't have it much longer.
Save our public schools. Listen to your constituents. No on Devos.
@SenBobCorker Also, I'm loud AF. So, your new normal includes a classically trained opera singer calling you every day.
can you hear us? Thousands of constituents begging you to do the right thing. #BeAMan #VoteNoDevos #resist
As a mother + former educator, I am appalled that you hold so little regard for our public schools in this decision #DumpDevos
@SenBobCorker I drive to Tullahoma and Fayetteville every day. Great drive for phone calls.
@SenBobCorker Oh, I almost forgot--WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE! This is your new normal. All of your #'s are in my contacts.
Caring is half the battle. Competence is the other and DeVos doesn't have it. Please see reason.
No!She is not qualified 2lead DeptofEd or be in the cabinet&you know it!! Stop playing party politics. Represent constituents.
you are not listening to your constituents and Americans. She is unqualified
@SenBobCorker , This B'ham-So College educator absolutely disagrees. DeVos is totally UNQUALIFIED. Say no to voting partisan
Both @SenAlexander & @SenBobCorker are falling down on the job. THIS is your legacy, and you WILL be replaced by actual states-people.
Listen to the people who you are in DC to represent, not the unqualified person who donates lots of money to your campaign.
what about what your constituents say?
she takes care of the pockets of senators like you, you mean. #DumpDevos
DeVos is unqualified for the job. Don't mess up public schools again like when you were Ed Sec or in TN!
