@SenAlexander why did you not support the children of Newtown?
@SenAlexander Thank you Senator. In reality, feeling helpless in a lock down situation in a home could change some negative opinions.
@SenAlexander poor decision.
@SenAlexander You have failed to perform the duties of the position assigned to you by your constituents. You have failed your country.
@SenAlexander SHAME ON YOU. And shame on you for voting against universal background checks. History will judge you.
@janeroper I would rather be judged by 12 than carried by 6 because I was too scared to defend myself until the cops could get there to help
@SenAlexander You are a coward, shame on you.
disgusting NRA puppet #Shame RT “@SenAlexander: Voted No on the so-called 'assault weapons' ban proposed by Sen. Feinstein #2ndAmendment”
@DonFleming1 yo mamma's Rollin pin is an assault weapon. Ever watch the news? Our enemies have full automatic weapons, we have open borders
@DonFleming1 If you get your way & BHO takes all guns away from Americans what will stop our enemies from destroying you?  Obama's speaches
@SenAlexander I am now active in  the move to amend organization.To get corp money out of politics

@SenAlexander you're an idiot. Did you know Australia has had no mass shootings since we passed massive gun control?
@felicityloughre Hey Aussie! Do you know you live on an island in the middle of the ocean? Guns have to come in by ship or air plane
@SenAlexander I never liked twitter until just now.
@SenAlexander Disgusting.  Low-life piece of crap.
@SenAlexander  support the gun lobby instead of your constituents.. Way to go .. if you're a coward.
@SenAlexander

@SenAlexander You're a bad, bad person.
@SenAlexander I say "No!" to you.
@SenAlexander Thank you Sir for understanding that criminals & crazies won't apply for any kind of back ground check. Bill won't stop evil
@SenAlexander People like you are the main problem in this country
@SenAlexander I'm not even American and I want to tell you 'go fuck yourself.'

@SenAlexander $9,900 in NRA contributions in 2006? You're not a senator; you're a whore. Just the kind of guy we need to vote out of power.
@SenAlexander Thanks for voting *for* the vote and against the bill. Maybe we can now find a solution & quit btng up honest gun owners.
@SenAlexander Background checks are the least we can do and what 90% of Americans want. Shame on you for voting "No." We deserve better!

@SenAlexander your vote was wrong. The current bill was common sense. Pandering to NRA doesn't look good. Reminds me of your TV alter ego...
@SenAlexander Your actions disgust me but I don't have to live with them, you do! Karma sucks. See you waving goodbye on Election Day.
.@SenAlexander Hey butthead- you just enabled 1000s of #gun murders, maimings, suicide. Have fun in hell you murdering asshole.

@SenAlexander Of course you did. B/c you fear the @NRA more than you value human life. You're a coward.
@LitsaDremousis universal background checks will never stop criminals & crazies from getting their hands on guns. Laws don't stop DWI's
@SenAlexander Thank you!
@SenAlexander bravo!  About time you came to your senses.
@SenAlexander Because Feinstein is a crazy woman who rarely does any research on a situation. Hard to try to write effective legislature!
@SenAlexander you idiot...

@SenAlexander Incredible.  My heart aches for the people who were victimized a second time: by your vote. #unamerican

@SenAlexander I'm a former Marine and current hunter.  Assault rifles designed only to kill many fast.  No other reason for their existence.
@SenAlexander Thank you for using facts over emotions with your #guncontrol vote and for protecting our Constitution #2a
@SenAlexander Nice to know a lunatics right to own a gun outweighs an innocents right to live. Shame on all of you!!!

@SenAlexander You are a moron.
@SenAlexander Disgusting!
@SenAlexander Good job Senator Alexander!
@senalexander As a retired disabled veteran, saying "No" to assault ban means "you just like guns" & you don't care2 safeguard our children.
