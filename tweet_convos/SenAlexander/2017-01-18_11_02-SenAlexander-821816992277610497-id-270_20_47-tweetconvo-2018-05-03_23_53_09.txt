Bull. She's never been to public school. As someone who was forced to go to Christian school this is terrifying. The ideals and
practices of Christian school are not going to work with the entire country. You don't learn as much because they spend so much
of the day spouting bible facts at you instead of teaching actual unbiased history and science which I learned in public school
after finally fighting my way out of that place. Having someone take over the public schools of America who has never been to
a public school is absolutely preposterous. In fact it's like having a president who's never held public office.

Unmatched. True. She is so unqualified. Please don't be bought. PLEASE vote with integrity for the sake of our future.
Are you getting me?  Let her give her millions to charity instead of lobbying to steal taxpayer money to promote HER religion.
Your support of @BetsyDeVos is an insult to NC teachers and children #Unqualified
Don't appoint another Greenspan!
please don't vote for Betsy Devos. She does NOT understand our students or our schools efforts to serve our next generation.
I'm sure your opinion of her capability isn't dependent on the $43,000 she's donated to your campaign.
I also don't understand how she's qualified when she's never taught, administrated, worked at, or even attended a public school
"Commitment" is not nearly enough! Please vote NO!

This is just untrue. #DeVos has no qualifications and NC Voters will be very unhappy with a vote in light of her inexperience
Her commitment is not enough! She has no public school  experience. She doesn't even understand educational terms! Embarrasing!
She ran Michigan's education system into the ground.  How does that possibly make her qualified? # thosepeskyfacts
I vote in NC & do NOT support unqualified @BetsyDeVos for Sec. of Educ. When you do not represent me I do not vote for you.
https://www.coursera.org/learn/edref/home …
"The people have a right to the privilege of education, and it is the duty of the State to guard and maintain that right."
We all saw her hearing. We've done our research. She has no qualifications!
as one of your constituents I humbly ask you vote down. I attended school in WSFC. She is not what our public schools need!
she is an embarrassment to the title. Reconsider your support for the sake of our children #StopDeVos
School choice does not have to mean privatizing our public schools. Do not appoint someone whose sole goal is destroying it.
https://archive.org/details/democracyeducati1916dewe …
I cannot think of a worse choice than DeVos. She has no experience and is anti-public education.
@SenAlexander #alternativefacts
once again proving his and the committee's blind incompetence #daddytrumpsays
she doesn't even understand special education regulations! DeVos is dangerous for our schools.
nope, nope, nope. And nope
you mean her commitment to PRIVATE education. She has ZERO regard for PUBLIC education, upon which millions depend. VOTE NO.
Sad capitulation. There is possibly no one less qualified. Our children deserve so much better
43,200...is that worth of children's education in NC? Sad you sold us out to the highest bid. Got to vote you out in 2018!!!
@GOPHELP Unmatched? R u  kidding me? The only thing that is unmatched is her $200MM in donations to Rep. Party. Unqualified
@GOPHELP not unmatched. She's never taught. She knows nothing about what we as teachers do in public schools. No experience.
This is just false. Betsy DeVos has no track record to show us a commitment to improving the American education system
Please explain, because I'm just not seeing how this is possible. Defend your position, Sir!
What do you mean by "our students"? Because my students/children will be harmed greatly by her. Nightmare for us.
DeVos is not and educator but a lobbyist. It is obvious u r only intersected in the party. Time for recall
is blind to incompetent Betsy Devos. Like making a lunch lady principal . . .  she's only gonna focus on the fish sticks.
unmatched? As in, she bought the nomination you mean.
@SenAlexander She has zero experiance and is completely unqualified for the job. The American people demand a 2nd hearing now.
As is her lack of experience and knowledge on issue at the heart of education. #DumpDevos #BoughtAndPaidFor
Unqualified! Our children deserve better. Your constituents are watching.
Unmatched in how catstrophic it could be. At least get someone with actual classroom experience. Vote No on @BetsyDeVos
Improving education?? kids in Michigan did worse after she started!!
It's because of short-sighted party-above-country attitudes like this that I left beloved North Carolina after most of my life.
Wow!  @BetsyDeVos doesn't know IDEA or proficiency vs growth or student loans   @SenatorBurr @SenAlexander Competency > Money please!
Not for every student. How will you protect my disabled child and my LGBT child's  right to a public education?
passion does not = qualification for the Secretary of Education. DeVos supports charter schools w/o holding them accountable!
@SenAlexander let's get real!  She doesn't even know IDEA is a federal law!! This is unacceptable.
#DeVosconfirmation More like oppty for gun mkrs. She wants guns in schools in case of bears. Really? #YouWorkforUs
Committed to Public ed?Show examples of how;  ex that she understands basic ed principles, oppty for all #DeVosconfirmation
Her only experience is profiting from defunding public schools. #CORRUPTION #conflictsofinterest
How can she expand education when she is ignorant of basic policy! Is Gov. trying to cripple our students?
Devos is committed to the destruction of public education. Of course Richard Burr's okay with that.
@GOPHELP her inexperience in the basic operation and laws is unacceptable as shown by her responses to questions #DumpDevos
You should be ashamed of yourself! This woman bought and paid for this position. She is unqualified and you know it!
She is not expanding opportunity because public schools are the best way to do that and she is actively working to defund them.
save yourself and listen to the teachers....Vote no. #DeVosconfirmation
She is wholly unqualified.
Masquerading behind poverty as a reason to "privatize education" is shameful! Its simple, line your pockets!
- only in being grossly unfit for the position & an insult to educators & students alike. #ourkidsmatter
Do you have an irrationally strong fear of bears?  Otherwise you must be idiot or totally corrupt (40K ring a bell?)
I am ashamed that you are my senator and spewing this garbage.  The rich get richer while regular folk are eaten by bears.
She has no experience with public schools and will gut them.
Hello, I hope the next 4 years pass quickly.  Australians have never been more concerned about what is happening in the US.
@SenAlexander Commitment to students...which ones? The ones whose schools in Detroit were destroyed by her irresponsibility?
@SenAlexander only if by opportunity you mean defunding public education.  #DumpDeVos
@GOPHELP Mr Burr are you against Teachers Unions? Looks like it get on the record as they appear. #DeVosHearing #maddow
Are you insane?  She doesn't know squat about education-  she doesn't even know the IDEA is a federal law.  DISGRACEFUL POWER BUY
I would not pick her to sub in my class! I would rather leave my students in charge!
@SenAlexander are u serious? What commitment  ?  Give me examples?
@GOPHELP I could not disagree more.
@GOPHELP if that's true why not allow more extensive questioning to prove it?!
@SenAlexander wow.
@SenAlexander  How do u guys feel about bear attacks on school campuses?
As a constituent of yours who works in Edu. at an HBCU, I plead with you not to confirm DeVos. She will ruin education for gens
So is her lack of experience with public education, student loans, and financial aid. She's deeply unfit to be Sec of Ed.
@GOPHELP she is awful
you are correct that it is "unmatched." She is the most unqualified of all nominees and a danger to education.
@SenAlexander #VoteNoDevos find someone more qualified she has no clue IDEA is federal law?!
Are you drunk or merely intent on maintaining your status as an insufferable shill?
An insult to hard-working EXPERIENCED folks who work for public schools that she wants to destroy & rob thru privatization.
I think you mean her DONATION$ are unmatched. Her answers in the senate hearing were an embarrassment to our nation.
Either you love to lie or you were asleep during the hearing. And you call yourself a Christian.
your just a republican lacky
No. Please vote No. She is unqualified for this position.
@SenAlexander Devoss is uneducated about education.
The people who pay your salary and health care have the right to hear the whole story on Mrs. DeVos.
What is @BetsyDeVos's track record for "commitment to improving" schools?? This woman is unqualified & u know just as well as
Big mistake @SenatorBurr
Please reconsider confirming decks for sec if educ. This is NOT a partisan issue, this is an issue for our children & she has failed in Mich
Bullshit. You were bought.  #$$$
Vote no!
please do not confirm Betty DeVoss. Every Republican I know says NO!! #nobetty
@BetsyDeVos clearly she is not capable of this position. She has no idea the why behind growth and proficiency.
Constituent from 28602; gravely concerned about her lack of experience/enthusiasm for public ed. Worried for my godchildren.
Private/charters are not always the answer/reachable for NC families. Will she stand for the rest of us? Consider carefully.
@SenAlexander you both are a sham. She is wholly unqualified and by endorsing her I question your motives!
Families in poor rural counties cannot possibly benefit from her administration.  How many of us do you represent?  Vote no!
I did not see that commitment in DeVos's answers.  She may know vouchers but basic education policy?? We can do better.
@SenAlexander Please don't confirm @BetsyDeVos. She doesn't understand central tenants of Education.
She's unmatched indeed.  And not in a good way.
This is absolute BS. Her commitment to "choice" is a dagger in the back of Public Schools. #payforplay. You are corrupt.
@SenAlexander Don't pee on us and tell us it's raining. Her performance in hearing is national embarrassment and you know it
Unmatched is one word for it. Non-existent is another.
@SenAlexander shame on you; do you think we're idiots?
No
@SenAlexander Unmatched in her lack of experience
How many political contributions (bribes) have you whores solicited from the #DeVos family?
.@SenatorBurr @SenAlexander After watching hearing, I strongly urge you to disregard her for ANY government position. Incredibly unqualified
@SenAlexander I hope you are NOT considering her to educate our youth. Horrible
@SenAlexander It is matched and exceeded.
On the planet Neptune perhaps. Take it from a teacher. Wait, we have no money, so why would you listen to us?
I dont know what Fantasyland you are living senators or that you just want to cya yourselfs do the right thing
as a parent of three school age children I expect better of our local administrators, let alone a national leader #NotoDeVos
Burr RECUSE Urself-Pay to play=BAD. Most charters don't perform. No pedagogical expertise&won't support disabled.
@SenAlexander unmatched, because it is so easily exceeded by those with actual relevant experience and knowledge as well
Profiles in Tremendousness
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
Your confirmation vote for Betsy DeVos is a vote against the MILLIONS of children in public schools.
Seriously?  She didn't know the difference between growth and proficiency as it applies to academic assessment. #DeVosHearing
@SenAlexander as someone who serves students protected by IDEA, her hearing indicated otherwise.  Offensive nomination.
@SenAlexander Shes done NOTHING,EVER to improve America's schools.Is there nothing sacred to @Gop ? Not even America's children
@SenAlexander our children deserve better!  She is not qualified for this job.
@SenAlexander Unmatched, but not in a good way.  Clearly, you are not thinking of school children.
@SenAlexander U mean the Grizzly would make a great Sec of Ed? 2020 can't come soon enough. Pub ed parents vote them out
@SenAlexander we will remember what you are doing to us. My child is reading the news. Says we are doomed. You allow this shame
so it's save to say you don't even know who this woman is right?
@SenAlexander She is a poor choice who has no classroom experience.
and her lack of knowledge and commitment to public education is also unmatched - from a constituent
Will you confirm how much @BetsyDeVos donated to your campaign?
are you being ironic?
@SenAlexander but what is the difference between growth and proficiency? Good to know your party can be bought.
Based on?  What was her plan?  Commitment doesn't equate necessary qualifications & experience to be successful.  Think of kids, not party!
@SenAlexander If so, ask her what MTSS is or her opinion on the most valid & reliable way to collect school climate data, etc.
hardly...has no clue about achievement...wake up
Saddened that your support for IDEA is negotiable. These kids need a champion. Where will they find that champion, sir?
http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/news/a52357/betsy-devos-hearing/ … Please, we are trusting you to put #CountryOverParty. #DeVoss is pure POISON. Grizzlies INDEED!
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos politely.....
no senator Burr  She is not qualified and why didn't you question her.  i expect better from my senators.
@SenAlexander DeVos  endangers special education students.  She lacks basic knowledge of federal law that protects our students
@SenAlexander Appointing @BetsyDeVos as the Secretary of Education is like appointing a teacher to be the Secretary of Defense.
@SenAlexander Considering @BetsyDeVos has done nothing but harmed education her home state, you are correct, sir. #unmatched
#notodevos
What about the disabled? She didn't even know the FEDERAL LAW. How does this help ALL students?
vote NO! #notodevos #supportyourteachers Our state is far enough behind!
You aren't fooling anybody.  @BetsyDeVos is a poor candidate & not at all qualified
Sen. Burr, did you really receive 40k in donations from her family? Guess we know what 30 pieces of silver buys these days
@SenAlexander How can she improve ed when she doesn't understand even the basics of ed? Embarrassingly unqualified. No to DeVos
She didn't know I.D.E.A. is federal law. You both should feel shame, bc your support of this unqualified person is shameful
Just bc ur heart might be in the right place doesn't make u capable to head a fed. dept. She's unqualified & w/o experience.
@SenAlexander  My question is, why is there a Dept of Education in the Fed Govt anyway? Constitutionally it's a State function.
Why do you think that the Federal Government can ensure better education? I trust the States more than the Feds.
States are more responsive to the needs of educating their own children. Less  bureaucracy is always better.
@SenAlexander her lack of knowledge on the simplest of education topics is unmatched.
@GOPHELP she may be committed, but that doesn't mean she is qualified. I want to hear more about her plans.
@SenAlexander move these votes forward and get Trump's cabinet nominated now! Enough! No honor.
@SenAlexander You all need to maintain decorum in these hearings! This is a vile, disrespectful display and we're sick of it!
You were there in person.  I was watching from home in NC. How can you possibly be serious! DeVos is not qualified!
@SenAlexander This candidate is so unqualified .  She came across as a true ditz. I can support vouchers, but Not her!
@SenAlexander even though she has not a clue #IDEA is fed law ensuring #FAPE & #LRE for children with disabilities #VoteNo
Unmatched because there has never been a more unqualifed nominee.  Shame on you for lying to the American public.
And what about that $46,000 donation from her? You can't possibly be unbiased in the matter. You have no scruples.
Grizzly Bears? The woman is comically incompetent. If you confirm, you are too.
@SenAlexander #votethebumsout that support #BetsyDeVos #confirmation
@SenAlexander #DeVos is an embarrassment
You joking?? At every turn she has showed herself to be profit-first, self-first. Her goals are unethical and unconstitutional.
@SenAlexander 

What is the point of a confirmation hearing if DeVos has already PAID for your vote? You sir, are disgusting!
Will share your position with NC public school teachers I know and love
at least we'll be safe from the grizzlies though. Piss off Burr. The hearing was atrocious.
@SenAlexander you mean her $$$/contributions are unmatched.
@SenAlexander if only she knew what any of that meant.
#BettyDevos isn't qualified and Republicans pushing her are on the same page with her to further destroy public education. SMH
@SenAlexander says the man who believes teachers don't care about kids!
@SenAlexander Senator Burr, you are transparent and your constituents see right through you. Shameful.
.@BadassTeachersA .@valeriestrauss @SenatorBurr PLEASE. Her answers were outrageous. Our kids deserve far better. http://badassteachers.blogspot.com/2017/01/unbearable-on-devos-hearing-marla.html …
@SenAlexander Senator Alexander, why haven't your staffers cleared your voicemail out yet? You are shameful. #StopDevos
@SenAlexander DeVos' commitment to destroying public education is unmatched. #unqualified #kidsdeservemore
Were you even listening?? Is someone holding you hostage and forcing you to tweet this nonsense? She's awful. The worst.

this is insulting to voters & to the many people working tirelessly, in the trenches, for low pay, bettering actual kids' lives
@SenAlexander you are my Senator I watched the hearings She incredibly unqualified for Sec of Education
@GOPHELP @DianeRavitch @SenWarren.  She wants to privatize w/ The Koch Brothers. Stand up for my kid & every public school kid!
are you listening to your constituents? Please provide specifics about her dedication to improving public education.
