You are embarrassing the great state of TN with deceitful partisanship. #PresidentObama existed and you held up #MerrickGarland for a year!
@SenAlexander do you suffer from short term memory loss? #merrickgarland
Donald Trump flies in the tradition of presidential tradition.
And the Garland hearings were when?
Are you for real?
Hey Senator Lamar: refusing to allow a sitting president his SCOTUS pick a hearing is typical GOP cheating and hypocrisy! Suck it up b-cup!
Hey Lamar! Do you read or think about these tweets before you send them? #Garland
With Trump as a role model, why would he?
filabuster to death!
Another @GOP liar. Maybe you forgot about your old crook boss Nixon and the filibuster against Abe Fortas. Lie, lie, lie. #Disgusting
Sort of like refusing to consider a nomination at all?
Except for last year when you and your comrades filibustered #MerrickGarland
You know what else flies in the face of tradition? A president elected by Russian interference.
Hmm... how does refusing to give a presidential appointment for the SCOTUS a hearing stack up in this so-called Senate "tradition"?
uh tradition? I think a new tradition was started last year by the Republicans for refusing to hold hearings with Garland
#merrickgarland
Please convince us too that TN is not full of morons who keep voting for you. It's obvious you've been in a coma this past year.
stop. Just...stop. It is too egregious. #stolenseat.
Ya'll don't have the votes to break a filibuster. I don't even think you have the votes to confirm.
Your hypocrisy is showing
Did you ever hear the name "Merrick Garland", you raving hypocrite?
So does not even holding a hearing for a nominee, but you were fine with that. You broke it.
. Was that your view when you ignored Merrick Garland, you hypocrit??
Merrick Garland says hi.

Y'all are such hypocrites.
I did not see the fair consideration of Merrick Garland.  Was that wrong?
You voted to filibuster Obama judicial nominees 121 times. #hypocrisy
You pissed in your bed, now lie in it. #Garland
#MerrickGarland, you shameless nonentity. #gophypocrisy
Denying Garland a hearing does, too.
blame the Biden rule

yeah he's obviously a hypocrite, too. 
and clearly that's not a 230 year tradition since it only dates back to 1992.
What's the Const. say?  (Rhetorical question.)  Sorry, going to block you now.
During campaign John McCain & Ted Cruz stated that if Hillary wins they'll never allow her to put a Justice on the bench.
Confirming Gorsuch would endorse and normalize unconstitutional political games #NoGorsuch
oh cry me a river.  You obstructionists refused to give Garland a hearing.  Now you want us to bend over?  NOT!
- “Denying the #Garland nomination — or any presidential nomination ... — flies in the face of 230 years of Senate tradition.”
hypocrite
So did NO HEARING for Merrick.
So you are proposing Gorsuch nomination be pulled in favor of Merrick Garland? You can't get away with such nonsense Lamar.
So does your handling of the Garland nomination Hypocrite
We're just playing by the rules you set. EADADIAF
You should have a neuro eval, sweetie.  #MerrickGarland
.@SenAlexander So-called potus under FBI investigation for TREASON is as disqualified to nominate as a scandal-free POTUS in last yr serving
Do you and your fellow McConnell-ites realize by saying this you ooze hypocrisy? Is it purposeful? Or do you just not see it?
hypocrite much?
are you familiar with the word hypocrite can you spell it can you pronounce it say it out loud try it
Merrick Garland.
w/all due respect, this is a joke after what the GOP did to Garland's nomination. Very tacky, senator. We need to do better.
The left despises our Constitution. Senate tradition is like a bug on the floor to be squashed. They're radical.
http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/446021/it-doesnt-matter-garland-didnt-get-hearing … Watch your mouth.
Merrick Garland
I guess Senator Alexander conveniently forgot about the Garland nomination and his party's refusal to even hold hearings.
I think the voters should get to decide who the next scotus nominee is. Let the next presidential election decide.
Merrick Garland.
"“I am going to do everything I can do to make sure 4 yrs from now, we still got an opening on SCOTUS,” NC Sen.Burr 11/1/16
REALLY?...you hypocrite...do you remember what you just did to Garland?...phony lying republicans..American people will finally make changes
Really? We know what you did.
A) Your hypocrisy knows no bounds, and B) If you're too naive to recognize the optics of such a statement, you should resign.
you're joking, right?
need we state the obvious #garland
Garland who?
Merrick Garland. GOP stole his seat. Quit being a a hypocrite. The American people see through your horse pucky.
You have no credibility or integrity after what you did to Merrick Garland.  Who broke the process?  Blame McConnell.
Like the Nuclear Option in circumventing the Super Majority with ObamaCare was?
just like #MerrickGarland. #Hypocrite
You sure ???  Like you Really sure you're qualified to make that statement after what u did to Garland + 8 yrs of obstruction under Obama
At least Dems gave Gorsuch a hearing. With that Gorsuch proved himself wrong for the job. #noethics #nohumanity #nojustice Garland hearing?
Actually, it's in line with a year of current Senate tradition.
Some of these account it's not bc u are citizens who will give u eligibility it's the Royalties relationship eligibility accomplishments
Wait...did I miss the Garland footage too? Seems our WHOLE COUNTRY did!
Sorry, Senator, sarcasm doesn't go over well on Twitter.  I mean, there's no way in hell you're serious, right?
And simply refusing your Constitutional dity to even allow a vote doesn't? Save your #hypocrisy for #Brietbart. It works there
MERRICK GARLAND
Senator you fly in the face of ethical behavior and reason. Also ignore history apparently. Fillibuster is a tool, not bad or good, a tool.
Remember Garland? You wouldn't even hear him out. He STILL IS a great choice. Gorsuch is untrustworthy.
MERRICK GARLAND MERRICK GARLAND MERRICK GARLAND
Merrick Garland
Merrick garland and a ton of other Obama appointments wonder where youve been.
Give it up. This dog won't hunt.
You broke it. Now you have to live with it.
uh.....
.@SenAlexander You mean like refusing to even speak w/ #MerrickGarland? How can U look at yourself in mirror when U spew that #hypcristy?
keep crying, bumpkin
Merrick Garland, Senator.
And what about not even giving Merrick Garland a hearing??? Your double standards and hypocrisy are getting exhausting
Well, what about GOP obstructing hearing for Mr. Garland? Hypocritical nonsense. #Truth
It was fine when you had a lame duck black man as POTUS, right??? Hypocrite!!!
What about the GOP weasels endlessly denying literally anyone Obama would've nominated? Christ, how do you sleep at night?
Lamar is another @GOP'er with short-term memory issues. Just wait until they go nuclear and destroy 230 years of precedent. #SCOTUS
wait a sec. it was 230 years since #merrickgarland ?? I have found the fountain of youth? Oh it is just you being a hypocrite.
Our memories aren't that short. Merrick. Garland. You. Hypocrite.
you are a hypocrite
please explain Garland....we'll wait
Just another #GOPHypocrite  But it's okay, Senator Lamar, it is all going into the sweep the #Democrats will have in #2018Election.
Unlike not even giving a hearing to Merrick Garland.Republicans memories so bad they should be checked for dementia.
CORRECTION: Flies in the face of 229 years, entirely consistent with 1 year of Senate tradition.
no nominations in last year of a Presidency--you know the rules.
Does the name Merrick Garland ring a bell?  You should be ashamed of yourself.
You are SUCH a turkey. #MerrickGarland
.@SenAlexander On reflection, I apologize. For insulting turkeys.
Merrick Garland.
Perhaps that tradition w/ Garland should have been respected. GOP is absurdly hypocritical , to the point of dysfunction.
Merrick Garland. How soon you forget.
Ah, Sen. Alexander. From my hometown. Just down the street. Two words: Merrick Garland.
.@SenAlexander HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA 
This is just hypocritical bullsht. Go be embarrassed.
I heard a guy named Merrick Garland never even got a hearing. Traditions... huh.
Garland
Our govt. is not a tradition. It is an experiment and we are experiencing #JUSTICE #NoGarlandNoGorsuch #RESISTANCE
Look, Lamar, you & your friends held us hostage for decades w/ your bs. Weapons of mass destruction, Obamacare, now 45s EOs.
Now it will take decades more 2 undo orange 45's cartoon drawings. So quit w/ the crying & take your medicine like we did.
so how was that flight to illegal obstruction of a nominee? Remember Merrick Garland? Dems do, you Hypocrite!
.@SenAlexander

MERRICK GARLAND.

Sir.
I shouldn't be, but I'm just dumbfounded at how obtuse you are. #Garland
Garland? Garland?
Sir, with all respect, remember Memphian Abe Fortas.
Merrick Garland
You're joking right? As I recall @GOPSenate filibustered Johnson's nominee in 1968 & then there's @GOPSenate 2016 Garland /1
you're a crook. http://realchange.org/alexandr.htm#deals …
Tradition? Not even giving Merrick Garland a hearing for partisan reasons flies in the face of Constitutional responsibility.
are you serious?? Were you in a coma for 8 years??
And NOT even allowing a meeting for Garland was what? You and your whole party don't have the high ground.
I am asamed to admit that you are my senator, and you CERTAINLY aren't representing my interests.
Remember Merrick Garland?
I think the number of years you are looking for here is actually 229, not 230 #MerrickGarland
Merrick Garland.
No sir, it's fairness for what your ilk did to voters and Judge Garland. Once you confirm Garland, Trump can pick the next one
Can you say that aloud without actually laughing in embarrassment?
GARLAND!
But refusing Merrick Garland a hearing did not?
Did you make this argument for Garland? If not just sit down. We see your games.
and as your constituents we are voting you out! Kinda like you GOP'ers dissed Obama's SCOTUS pick
The WHY did REPUBLICANS DO IT last year? You can't turn around after that performance and chastise the Democrats for it now. HYPOCRITE!
you misspelled Gorsuch. It is spelled G-A-R-L-A-N-D.
Really?  Unlike ur refusing to do ur job and vote up or down the Merrick nomination?  KARMA SUCKS!!!
So what exactly happened last year? Remind me about Scalia's vacancy.
K
that’s a truly shameless thing to say after you flew in the face of 230 years of Senate tradition by doing worse to Garland.
Have you been checked for short term memory loss? Refresh your memory from last year.
I also thought presidents released their tax returns but I guess that tradition is not important?
#MerrickGarland
Great! We'll be expecting your support for Merrick Garland any day now. @SenAlexander
You and your Party are simply the most foul liars I have ever had the displeasure of knowing! We are sick of the lies!
.@SenAlexander You have NO high ground to lecture from on Supreme Court nominees - just shut up. #MerrickGarland
Merrick Garland
Merrick Garland. #MerrickGarlandSCOTUS #TrumpRussia
I know you GOP guys murdered irony, but can you please stop dancing on its corpse?!
I looked at the comments written - TN isn't so happy with you. Vote against this yoyo so you can hold your head up!!!
Tell that to Merrick Garland. The hypocrisy you guys display on the regular is amazing.
Merrick Garland.
Nah, don't need to hear what any GOP pol has to say on this
What is the definition of hypocrisy?
Aw, it must suck to be treated the same way you treat others.

So when is the up and down vote on Merrick Garland ? Hypocrite.

How stupid and forgetful do you think Americans are? Do you really have such contempt for our intelligence? #MerrickGarland
How does Merrick Garland feel about it? #hypocrite
Judge Garland disagrees with you.
WTF???!! How about the last year of #Senate tradition. 
#MerrickGarland
