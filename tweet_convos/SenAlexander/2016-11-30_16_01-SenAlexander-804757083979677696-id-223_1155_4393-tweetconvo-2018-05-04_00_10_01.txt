Joe I am so so angry with you. You should have run for POTUS ! Now we are stuck with this clown !
Seriously can we just keep you and Obama for four more years. Please!
how much are the pharmaceuticals getting and how much is going to better food?
Thank you for all you do.
then why don't we do more research on marijuana treatment for cancer. Or one of the many other methods that our govt protects us from?
I worry abt Cures, there is no controls on Pharmacy. Please control these guys.
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse where is your Outrage and voice for Justice
@SenWarren Joe please look into the concessions given to pharma on this bill. We've got to clean this up 1st. TY
Big Pharma giveaway.  It should have included legalizing Cannabis.
Good Luck. Cancer touches everyone. Let's eradicate this dreaded disease
Hi
@WhiteHouse the right to invest in #Cancer #research is reserved by the people, #10A, it was not delegated
How about #epi funding. Many are still without the ONLY lifesaving drug. Many parents cry themselves to sleep? #foodallergy
On the fence here.  Still reading it.  Found Senator Warren's list of concerns to be  .... very worrisome about some elements of it.
happy for you and so happy for my daughter who has FA. Love you
Thank you Joe, for anything you do. My husband, and many of my loved ones died of cancer, so any help is appreciated.
I have difficult under your law .I am simple for my lovely friend.
please work on Health insurance for middle class.  1st time in my entire 52 years I'm priced out of ins.  $700 a month not affordable
,@JbgasaJohn , You have advocated to save our lives , May lord bless you . Am a witness of you´re good deeds
You are the best. You give us hope.
of course I'm partial 2 the moonshotI submitted my most novel proposal yet 2 help make prevention a reality &chemo meds more effective
@WhitfordBradley you are like your boss are such a class act and are going to be so missed.  Thanks for all you do.
Mr . Biden...we love you so much. I in vision a 2017 Presidency Biden, and get a hitch in throat, but understand, but still wish. Love!

lead scientist William Thompson CDC 2004 MMR study was a lie and cover up why was this ignored when given to congressman bill posey???
why is it that dr William Thompson from CDC gave 10,000 documents proving CDC fraud sep 2015 to congressman bill posey NOTHING DONE????
stopping the fraudulent toxic vaccines will help stop cancer. Vaccines r not safe and effective It's a lie #CDCFraud #VAXXED
But if the Repubs kick 20 million off their insurance and get rid of Medicare and Medicaid how will working class people afford it?
I sincerely hope it passes. Thank you V.P Biden. Thanks for your service to our country.
@WhiteHouse tell @POTUS to save Stading rock veterans are going to be human shields were is he
For limited, unguaranteed funding over 10 years with all the potential harm @SenSanders and @SenWarren have pointed to?
Biden & America need to watch THIS FREE MOVIE (no sign ups) about Cancer, and this vote:  http://ffilms.org/dark-amazon-2014/ …
thank you VP Biden.  My brother would have been 53 today.  He also died from GBM.
You are amazing!
Joe does Paul Ryan have enough to privatize/remove Medicare, Medicaid, SSI & Social Security?
What is #Crosscheck ?
Why is it happening?
@WhiteHouse wonderful job I'm sure cancer patients survivors and families all over thank you
it's selling your souls to Big Pharma.
happy bday DAD

From a 17 year old rare disease patient, thank you.  I think your son would be so proud.
@POTUS @WhiteHouse #NoDAPL #HonorTheTreaties #IStandWithStandingRock
@WhiteHouse we all will miss u. Praying for a cure and our country
Cures is watered down for Big Pharmacy. Stand up and fight.

so is #folding but #spectrum thinks I'm doing naughty w the internet..
@WhiteHouse No More Passing Anything You Democrats Want Passed..Because We're Sure It's Got Loop Holes To Do Other Things..Your Crooks
Bless you, Joe. I have your book, "Promises to Keep". Wonderful story of your life.
I have lung, adrenal, and brain cancer. Im on opdivo and stable. Thank-you for fighting for us. God bless you.

Will there be a #CanadaArm component to UR passionate #CancerMoonshot effort during upcoming visit to  ?  We'd ❤︎ to contribute!
this law will result in more addictions.  You should not have compromised.
@WhiteHouse don't worry, I'll roll that back.
Thank you, Sir, and your entire staff for all your work toward this effort.  
love you Joe  I'm gonna miss you.
hope so
What about #DAPL Is @Potus going to fix that before he goes?
#CuresAct #CancerMoonshot all that's doing is give drug companies rights2pass drugs that are filled with poisons that cause cancer.
:)  Thank you for all you do.
@WhiteHouse pls make sure Americans are safe.  Lots of earmarks in that bill! @maddow @MSNBC
. Good work, sir!
@WhiteHouse Yo groping Joe, your checking account is overdrawn!
Hurry and Thanks 
@SenSanders will not allow it....so sad!
good luck mr.biden
:this is where you belong!
Thank you, Sir. You have been a great VP. You are CLASS.  I hope you and Jill will have the opportunity to take a long vacation soon.
- really?  Is big pharma onboard?
apparently so
what would @NancyPelosi say?
@WhiteHouse hopefully research will actually be done...40-50 years and still using chemo and radiation? Those treatments are suicide
that's called being  non-partisan if it's for the good of all. Maybe you'll teach them something Mr. Biden
Thanks for the update. Looking forward to passage also.
MORE taxpayer funds to an industry that can't cure a damn disease? Invest in cemeteries & wait on a VAST increase in dangerous drugs!
@WhiteHouse good
what does Bernie think?
ill miss you
Oh Joe, I am going to miss you
Thank you for the work your doing Biden my grandmother died of Brain Cancer and I helped nursed her till the end more research needed
Hope it passes before that nut moves into the White House.
Generics will have to wait longer to go on the market. The Cure bill is a corporate givesway to big Pharma and medical device industry

Requset
Bizarre moment for a Moderate R voting for HRC. Woke up in tears. Dreaming telling @POTUS to forgive them...gave me a hug & tissue.
Hip Hip Hooray - declaring War on Cancer!  Run Cancer run, Uncle Joe is coming!  (I mean that in a good way for Joe Biden).
You would have made a wonderful president Joe. I'm going to miss you 
YAAAAAY!!! 
so do we Uncle Joe you carry your pain with dignity you are the best thanks and God Bless
Joe, I hope the portion that cuts Medicare has been removed. Opioid crisis $, should not be in that bill either. Just my opinion.
JOE, JOE, JOE, JOE!!!! You are
 AMAZING and you and your compadre @POTUS  are going to be terribly missed!
I've lost two close friends to cancer in the last year alone. Even a step closer to a cure would be a miracle
it allows big pharma to legally commit fraud.
@WhiteHouse.Forbes
your the best Joe!
@WhiteHouse Only Moonshot's Trump Likes are Women's Asses!  Good Luck with Trump doing anything!
USA loves you
Thank you. Longing for the day cancer will be treated as a manageable illness.
Great job Uncle Joe!!  Can we start with our farmers - our foods?  it's killing the American people.
You will be missed as VP Sir.  We can only hope this great bill won't be turned into a fast track to gouging.
I am going to miss you VP Biden!!
Thank you at least we still have you two for awhile longer ,all the good you both attempted, You tried to promote peace .uwillbemissed
Sign it soon!
Trump & Co will probably de-fund cancer research & spend $ on wall 
#notmypresident
Please take over the DNC Mr. Vice President. Our party needs you after January 20th.
