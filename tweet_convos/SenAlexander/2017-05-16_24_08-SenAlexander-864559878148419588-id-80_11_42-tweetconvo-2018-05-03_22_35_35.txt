You are screwed on healthcare repeal and tax cut for the rich. You sold your soul to trump. Now he is taking whole GOP down. Failure!
An idiot backs an idiot
Great, you are off having a fancy breakfast while Trump is giving away national secrets.  #ImpeachTrumpNow
All White people.
Please support President Trump
Support our @potus and stop being a weak Rhino.  Time to be courageous and take a stand vs the #fakenews of the liberals.  @realDonaldTrump
Traitor to the USA
That would be @BarackObama
 perp walk very soon! 
Support PRESIDENT TRUMP! Or be voted out
Time to impeach, country before party!!#!
This TN voter wants an end to the leaks now and the leakers prosecuted.
This TN wants an end to the leaks and the leakers prosecuted now.
2018 is just around the corner
Support President Trump. I do.
Helen, for your steadfast devotion, support, and loyalty to the president, here's hoping that he makes you Mrs. Trump #4 someday.
That's why we voted Trump! For our country!  Clinton would have destroyed all we were built on.. socialism does not work!!
Corky, remember good ol' days, back when you were on your knees for Pooty Call in lobby, under Golden Arches of Russky Mafia Towers?
It would be nice if you'd meet with your constituents when you're in TN. When will either of you hold a town hall in Middle TN?
You support Trump in allowing this?
I'm being told this vid shows bodyguards of Trump's buddy, Turkish dictator Erdogan, viciously beating up Americans in DC today. Is it true? https://twitter.com/VOATurkish/status/864631567972540417 …
in the face of a full frontal assault by MSM, disappointed in your failure to be supportive of President Trump.
Pass The FairTax Law. Get rid of the Commie Manifesto Prog Income/Inheritance Taxes. Socialism is a foreign ideology as such unConstitional.
Explain why your committee decided to not issue sanctions against Russia for their interference in our election!! You owe us an explanation!
Ur comments regarding the Whitehouse today r a shameful disgrace. U r not serving the People's mandated agenda. U r serving urself. Disgust.
Exactly!!
Thanks for keeping in touch with constituents (all lawmakers should do so).
i'd like to go next time so i can ask y'all to your face what the hell you're going to do about russia.
You Senators are an embarrassment to the memory of Howard Baker. U both do nothing as Trump tramples on truth our allies & our Constitution
Don't be complicit in Trumps treason. America needs you to protect Her.
come on senator, aren't you getting tired of trump? Get rid of him and get back to America's work
the airline ban on laptops is not classified it was all over the public broadcast, i believe our general ,potus
It would be nice to invite Autistic families
Lieberman: early onset Alzheimer’s, endorse McFrenchfry-Palin(g) ticket. Full-blown: endorse DeVos-lution institutionalized dumb-down

Looking forward to both of you shaved in the streets like the classic & harrowing images of French collaborators after Paris liberated
Both RINOs!  Both need to be defeated.  I'm asking the Tea Party to get a primary opposer to Corker!
CORKER, PUT A CORK IN UR HUGE BACKSTABBING RINO MOUTH WE WILL NOT REELECT U IF U R THE OPPOSITION TO OUR POTUS. UR A JUDAS
WTF?  U HAD STAND With OUR POTUS OR UR DAYS WILL B NUMBERED
YOU MUST IMPEACH TRUMP NOW
Please, please, please put country above party. POTUS is an unhinged, mentally unstable kleptocrat. You know it. Please do the right thing.

Continue throwing dirt on @POTUS 

And you'll be voted out

Just like McCain

Thought you were smarter than that
Tennessee voters, you have put in Senate a man who betrays you, your values, and America. He is paid for and owned by Obama's gang.
Senator, the moment you signed on IranDeal, you have betrayed America. We will never forget that.
He doesn't want to be tried for treason himself.
Hopefully they let you know how much we need a special prosecutor to investigate TrumpRussia oh and the taxes
Absolutely disgraceful what you said regarding @realDonaldTrump Why don't you switch to DNC #SethRich
For once. He's also a traitor if he doesn't act NOW!
Resist this mad king Donald trump. If you have a soul, you know it's the right thing to do.
Can they be trusted? Can they keep secrets? Can they teach President Plump to shut his constantly open mouth & out of control ego?
RINO CORKER...GET BEHIND THE PRESIDENT. We The People gave you the majority. Do what we voted for. Get behind the president you Rino!
It's for anyone who is in DC on a Tuesday when Congress is in session.  I've been. Just plan ahead when you go.
Did they ask you why you support a president who gives nat sec secrets to Russia?
He actually isn't supporting this.
Ok - what steps has he taken to end his support of Trump?
He's at least speaking out about the latest. Doing more than most.
He said WH is in "downward spiral" & needs to get itself under control. Empty words to calm us & keep power in WH vs give it to congress.
It's congress' job to keep pres in check in cases like this but GOP just issues statements of concern that absolve them of responsibility.
The WH isn't going to "bring itself under control & order". To think they will at this point is ludicrous. Congress needs to act.
Don't give GOP senators a pass just for issuing statements of concern. If they don't call for action against this pres, words are useless.
Any public school teachers there???  
You will b voted out ,,,,liberal hack Bob Corker
Stand with @POTUS or resign.
How about the POTUS just resigns.
Romancing the constituent GOP, enablers of Trump disasters, not willing to accept responsibility for DJTrump disasters in the White House.
How about your quarterly unconstitutional taking of private property from Fannie Mae shareholders.....don't we get any breakfast?
I'm a constituent. You are Chairman of Foreign Relations. Trump passed info to  adversary.  DO SOMETHING!
The president can choose what is classified and can disclose this information to whoever he pleases.
Are you just a tour guide and Never- Trumper? Why don't you just join the Dems. #RINO
#traitor #FireCorker
You need to get your act together and stand by our POTUS if you like to be re elected Shame on GOP Senators like you who alway backstab Pres
trump admits what he did. Read something. Turn off fox.  Please.
Maybe you should turn off CNN
I wish I could be there. I have so many ?s for you. Do something about Trump. If you R's decide to do something we still have @VP Pence
I'm a registered voter in TN. Please push for an independent investigation of #Trumprussia, or I will vote for your competitor in 2018. Thnx
You are a DemocRAT and never going to vote for him anyways. So go ahead and threaten him
I'm a Republican in TN who will not vote to re-elect any senator supporting Trump. Frustration and disgust with Trump is bipartisan. Thanks!
Unfortunately that is how republicans are, always back stabbing their own party. Sad.
Some politicians are able to put party over country. Independent investigation into #TrumpLeaks NOW.
Blah blah blah

Did trump hurt your feelings? 
I was going to try to make it a few months ago.
