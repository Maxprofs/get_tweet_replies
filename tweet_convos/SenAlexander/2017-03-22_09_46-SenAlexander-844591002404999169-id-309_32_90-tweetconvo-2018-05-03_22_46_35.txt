Not so odd when you consider "they" would also like to do away with our Constitution.
#pot #MerrickGarland
you mean like obstructing the rightful president nominate for this very chair? Shame on you.
HAHAHAHA #MerrickGarland
Unbelievable. Where was your concern for 230yrs of tradition last year?
doing unto others....
Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland
.@SenAlexander GOP started the fire. Don't blame Democrats for the arson. #GorsuchHearing #hypocrisy
great!!!
.@SenAlexander like refusing to hold hearings for Merrick Garland wasn't a breach of tradition and Senate responsibility! #GorsuchHearing
However, what's good for the goose...
Maybe you should of thought of that when you wouldn't even consider Merrick Garland!
Gee, almost like not even bringing Garland's nomination to committee for 11 MONTHS. Pot, meet Kettle. #GOPhypocrites
Don't allow it. Force through the Nucleur Option and confirm the man on YOUR TIME LINE, not the dem's
always for the rich and powerful.  #Tennessee says NO.
#MerrickGarland deserved a vote
You are the enemy of working class tennesseans
@SenateMajLdr Go nuclear!
You mean like not bringing a Presidents nominee up for debate?
oh stop. You never even gave Garland a hearing we are not stupid. y'all had it coming. Work together and stop crying. SAD!
you work ONLY for the wealthy. Stop it with your freedom, Christians values, and fear mongering. Greed is what you work for!
check that, more like 1 year tradition.
@SenateMajLdr lol, the Federalist Society is not picking our next justice. Gorsuch is a two bit ideologue, let him hang
@SenateMajLdr McConnell blew everything up long ago
What hypocrisy. GOP wouldn't even give Obama's pick a hearing. You should be ashamed.
but not holding a hearing for a presidential nominee didn't? Listen to yourself.
as did denial of Garland nomination, what goes around...
Americans before @GOP! #POTUS abuses power of office for personal financial gain! Betrays public trust! Instability! IMPEACH!
Oh--side note. Please don't overturn the ACA. And voting to kill hibernating bears is just a Dick move.
Yeah? Kind of like when you decided to not let a sitting President choose a SCOTUS? Like Obama? Really not the issue. Gorsuch is awful.
@SenateMajLdr do u think the Dems care. ? Get real
@SenateMajLdr huh... you guys did this very thing to Obama's selection!
why don't you just go back to the TN governor's mansion and fool around with the grounds keepers like you did in the old days?
What about the absolute denial of even giving Garland a chance when President Obama was in office? You are wrong
I remember when I thought you were a statesman. Now you are just another sellout. No credibility or integrity
As opposed to not even having a hearing for a qualified candidate? You have sold your soul
refusing to even entertain a Justice nominee last term was completely upstanding and traditional though.
so would an intel chairman rushing to the President to warn him of damaging information before it go through committee!
I think you mean "refusing to hold a hearing for months because the sitting President is a Democrat." Unbelievable.#hypocrite
So did refusing to give Garland a hearing, but that didn't stop you.
What are you talking about? This has been the Senate tradition for a year now.
Then postpone the vote until we can  determine who the legitimate leaders of  WH are/should be
@SenateMajLdr Really? You say that with a straight face? Will you go to jail with #donaldtRump as well? #impeach #resist
.@SenateMajLdr @SenAlexander You'll shuffle off with only 1 credit to your name old man: THE most craven and savage hypocrite in US history.
Merrick Garland
MERRICK GARLAND.  Let it fly.  I wish you represent Tennesseans by standing up to the frightful TrumpBannon regime.
you really should think before you tweet!
Not holding hearings on Obama's nomination did the same. Republicans have already opened that door.
.@SenAlexander After not voting on Garland, you say this!? You have no shame. Vote no on Gorsuch
@SenateMajLdr So does stealing seats but that didn't stop you, did it?
let's talk about the traditions of the Executive Branch that have been laid to waste since Jan.
Like Merrick Garland's fair hearing?
When did the politician I used to respect prioritize party over country?
Remember Merrill Garland? That's right. The GOP wouldn't even consider his nomination.
@SenateMajLdr Merrick garland was nominated in 2016 not 1787
@SenateMajLdr To all those tweeting "Merrick Garland" - my response: "Biden Rule".
@senjudiciary @SenateDems boycott Gorsuch hearings. Can't move forward until #FBI learns abt @realDonaldTrump.
@SenateMajLdr you are right! We should just refuse to vote. Hypocritical much?
Lamar you know better. Shame on you.
You mean JUST LIKE denying a hearing to President Obama's nominee? Gee did you forget #PBIMF
So did refusing to even have a hearing on #Obama nominee Garland. Get over yourself, #GOP stooge. #RESISTANCE
@SenateMajLdr Use Nuclear option and get him in!!
@SenateMajLdr There's no longer  Senate tradition. You & yours are destroying every decent value I cherish.
Remember when Merrick Garland didn't get a hearing? When was that? Remember when you had any principles whatsoever? (I don't)
MERRICK GARLAND
seriously? You wouldn't meet with Garland bc it was Obamas last year, but its ok when Trump is under FBI investigation?
@SenateMajLdr and save our Nation from this hardcore Republican
@MMFlint you have to read what Senator Alexander has the nerve to post
@SenateMajLdr McConnell refusing President Obama his appointment flies in the face of tradition, the Constitution, & decency.
Seriously? The hypocrisy has reached expert level.
Expect more from you @SenAlexander. Stop being a mouthpiece for the party known as the Party of No. Now known as the Party of No Morals.
That is so unbelievably hypocritical on your part. I remember when you still had a sense of decency. Very sad.
Merrick Garland who?
that's ironic considering the way your party handled Merrick Garland's nomination.
@SenateMajLdr democraps will force nuclear option don't wait do it now.
You sang a different tune by refusing to even vote on Merrick Garland. #hypocrisy
and this is one of our leaders 
so did refusing to give Merrick Garland a hearing. Do you even listen to yourself??
No president has ever appointed someone to the SCOTUS while under FBI investigation, until now.  Worry about that tradition.
@SenateMajLdr THIS IS AMERICA, COMRADES. ONLY MY PARTY GETS ITS WAY!
hy·poc·ri·sy
noun
the practice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs to which one's own behavior does not conform
Not allowing a debate on the Merrick Garland nomination flies in the face of how many years? Senator.
kind of like refusing to meet Garland for an entire year?  You hypocrite.
@SenateMajLdr How many years of tradition did not even hearing #MerrickGarland fly in the face of? SHAME ON YOU.
See, Last 6 years. You and GOP changed the rules, complaining about your own tactics isn't meritorious. #Hypocrisy #Gaslight
@SenateMajLdr you are such a waste. Those filibusters are there for a reason not to accommodate has been senators. Resign!!!!!
Quite a bit less than 230 years of Senate tradition - See Merrick Garland nomination March 16, 2016
@SenateMajLdr Where were you during the last year when the GOP was unethically stonewalling the Garland nomination?
Really? And what about what you did last year?
And what about Merrick Garland? Your re-election is now in question! I say VOTE you out!
Yeah, so did failing to have hearings for a sitting president's nominee.
@SenateMajLdr Gorsuch is and always will be an illegitimate SCOTUS nom because of what you all did regarding #MerrickGarland
Merrick Garland. He should be sitting on the court. No nomination while FBI investigates that disaster of a human being Trump
and you guys all voting him in flys in the face of fairness.......oh fair did I mention fair? not in your vocabulary guys!
How about the number of @Scotus nominees denied a hearing by the @GOP - that would be one - last year by you. @SenAlexander @SenateMajLdr
@SenateMajLdr Hypocrisy that you speak of tradition for a stolen seat and a nomination by @POTUS under FBI investigation.
Gorsuch on bench in light of #Trumprussia seems treasonous. Merrick Garland never even got a hearing! Tradition? #StopGorsuch
Really? Worse than failing to even consider a legitimate candidate proposed by a Democrat? What political hypocrisy.
MERRICK FUCKING GARLAND. 
@SenateMajLdr Given your hatred for America and her people, it might be time to break with tradition.
Tradition left the building when @realDonaldTrump was elected.
P. Manaford, Gl Flynn, Tillerson, W.Ross: ALL WORK for  RUSSIA ; IMPEACH Donald TRUMP! they all are TRAITORS & so R U
You've got the audacity to even utter these words. @maddow @JanJazJea @azil1105
Somewhat like what your party did to the Merrick Garland nomination.
.@SenAlexander WAIT. What? Isn't this what happened with Garland? Please explain to me the difference. I'm your constituent, btw.
I just read all the replies. There are 179 of them. There isn't a single person who agreed with you. We remember 6 months ago.
MERRICK GARLAND. Do you realize your own hypocrisy on that one? I hope the comments have helped you remember . . .
Really Senator what about Obama's nominee?  Did you give him a hearing? No, you played politics instead
how about not doing your job and refusing an equally qualified Judge#Tradit a hearing? #AmericanValues #tradition
as the #obstruction by @GOP on the previous nominee made #goodsense?  #partyoverpeople  #lameduck #votethemout
what about the NOT giving a vote when it was Obama's candidate?
You will both answer to God for your hyprocrisy and given your ages .. sooner than later ... shove it.
Quite a lot about our current gov't flies in the face of tradition, sir. In fact, "spits in the face of democracy" would be more apt.
With Merrick Garland Republicans flew in the face of their Constitutional Obligation!
protecting Russia infiltration flies in the face of patriotism
And what about Republicans not even giving Obama's candidate a hearing? Your the pot calling the kettle black!
@SenateMajLdr What, is Merrick Garland chopped liver? Do YOU have Russian ties too???
Read your replies, fossil: Merrick Garland These lies don't become us.
Support our President who is carrying burden of all of us to MAGA.
let them do it...go NUCLEAR will be much easier when Trump gets to appoint another one
It's highly hypocritical of you to criticize when you refused to give #MerrickGarland a hearing! You have NO shame!
puhleeease!
@SenateMajLdr I believe we should wait for the next president to decide hurry up and impeach cheeto he looks good in orange
@SenateMajLdr  Why haven't you told VOTERS that you're voting to gut labor safety rules?  This is disgusting.  VOTE NO
--  I hope you don't retire so we can vote you out.
@SenateMajLdr LOL! How can you keep a straight face, Lamar?
Investigate MANY in #trumprussia's "Cabinet" (TILLERSON PRICE ROSS CHAO JARED IVANKA) for GRAFT and/or COLLUSION. 
 #RESIST 
at least he got a hearing
you know better. You are an embarrassment to this state. Please resign so someone with integrity can represent us.
An embarrassment to the whole nation!
@SenateMajLdr Lining directly up with the more recent McConnell Doctrine
@SenateMajLdr SO DOES STEALING A SCOTUS SEAT FROM OBAMA so deal with the shenanigans as the GOP started the bullshit.
get ready for a fight about everything the Democratic party's tired of being pushed around
Well you guys would not even give Merrick a hearing! Time for ALL to stop obstructionism & lead!  #2020
Fixed it for you - Refusing to consider Garland nomination would fly in the face of 230 years of Senate tradition.
Remember Merrick Garland? You refused to even give him a hearing. That flew in the face of Senate tradition.
my oh my, you really don't get the concept of hypocrisy do you? GOP Shame.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME WITH THIS MAN? WHAT ABOUT THE GUY YOU WOULDNT EVEN GIVE A HEARING?
@SenateMajLdr how can you claim to honor tradition when you did not honor it last year! #GOP #incompetence #resist
@SenateMajLdr Please, stop your nonsense. You both know what you did not having a hearing for Garland. Have you know shame.
says the man who would not even meet with garland. Get off your high horse sir.
Garland was a slap in the face to history.Your hypocrisy is stunning. Judge Garland was not even given a hearing. It was wrong
@SenateMajLdr Merrick Garland?
Mr Alexander,  Republicans unprecedented decision to totally ignore the rights of the American people, POTUS Obama & Judge
Hypocrite.
@SenateMajLdr this is ridiculous.
@SenateMajLdr R u guys really clueless or just pretending w conviction?
Really!?!? Then what do you call corrupt @SenateGOP treatment of Garland? #hypocrisy
Do you even read history? Robert Bork.
Also, in the history of the US, no senate has never denied a candidate a hearing, but here we are.
MERRICK GARLAND
@SenateMajLdr By the way Judge Garland has not withdrawn his nomination
@SenateMajLdr kinda like blocking a Supreme Court nomination for the president?
@SenateMajLdr So would not following the Constitution and giving Merrick Garland a hearing & a vote.
@SenateMajLdr MERRICK GARLAND!! #whataboutMerrick
Weird, I don't remember you getting upset about this happening to Merrick Garland...
what tradition led you to not even consider Merrick Garland?
sounds like you have amnesia and sorry to say, that makes you unfit for office. Respectfully ask you to resign.
Russia influencing our election flies in the face of every America.  #prioritize
@SenateMajLdr How old is the tradition of blocking a POTUS candidate because it is an election year? I mean actually doing it.
No nomination until Russian influence is proved or not proved.
Trump has tainted presidency, may be out of office before year end. His nominee should be tabled while active FBI investigation taking place
#MerrickGarland you giant hypocrites!
Know what flies in the face of 230 years of our democracy? #TREASON Stop being complicit @SenAlexander! #NoSeatForYou #DoOverElection2017
Sorry, Lamar. The Senate's position on Merrick Garland's legitimate nomination. Poor memory OR politics of convenience?
@SenateMajLdr and what about not even allowing Garland a hearing. Can't believe you even said this
Tradition is not synonymous with doing what is right and just for the American people and your constituents.
