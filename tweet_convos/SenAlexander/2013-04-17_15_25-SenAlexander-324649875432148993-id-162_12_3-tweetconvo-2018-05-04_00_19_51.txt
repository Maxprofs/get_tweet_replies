@SenAlexander as a TN resident and native, I'm ashamed at the vote you cast. Stand up and make a difference, not follow the money.
@DavidJEllis @SenAlexander Well said Dave We tightened gun laws in Oz following a massacre 17yrs ago We're now all much safer with less guns
@Peter_Fox59 would love to see it happen here in the states. More people here need to know how it helped there, might help change perception
@DavidJEllis I surrendered my semi-auto like thousands of others. Don't need those to hunt or target shoot. We are much better off.
@SenAlexander You are a disgraceful human being, who is a complete and utter moron. The fact you are in public office is laughable. Loser
