This doesn't mean jack shit when you vote against actual gun control measures.
Your thoughts are nice, but what about your actions? What steps have you taken to end gun violence? #noassaultweaponsinTN
This was a hate crime. LGBT people die every day and you do nothing.
How about channeling your "heart" into ACTION? Save others from this fate by finally DOING SOMETHING and joining #filibuster
You've voted against these families & the people killed. You've voted for every single gunmen in each shooting w/ the NRA.
Honor them with some common sense legislation so your heart isn't merely going out to another group of victims next time.
To set the record straight. After Newtown, @SenAlexander voted against the ban on military style weapons
You can do more.  You can join your colleagues to #holdthe floor.
Do. Something.
Is that all you have to say, @SenAlexander? Why did u vote against blocking #firearm sales to #terrorists? #Orlando http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&session=1&vote=00319 …
But what will you do to prevent it next time?You were one of 50 Senators who voted against laws that could have prevented this
HOW ABOUT USING YOUR PLATFORM OF AUTHORITY TO DO SOMETHING! WE NEED GUN CONTROL NOW!! HOW MAY PEOPLE HAVE TO DIE? #guncontrol
There's blood on your hands. No one wants to hear your empty platitudes. Do us all a favor and resign. #OrlandoShooting
Keep ur heart and DO SOMETHING instead like passing gun control legislation!
We don't want your thoughts & prayers. How about extending some common sense gun laws to prevent violence?
actions not words. You work for me, not the NRA. #DisarmHate
Then let the will of the people speak without having the corrupted RINO's interfering. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Your despicable voting record does not match your words. How do you sleep at night? #gunviolence
it was more than an act of terror, it's a hate crime. Stand with us LGBT and ban assault weapons so it doesn't happen again.
#dobetter
if you really care, do something about it. We need gun control. We need screenings. We need LAWS.
if you mean this, please say it with your votes.
stand with @ChrisMurphyCT correct you vote on HR 1076 now #ENOUGH
But yourstill beats. And what you're doing w/your life = aiding the NRA. That's blood on your hands.
Assault Rifles shouldn't be available to the public. Especially not those on the terror watch list.
Will this attack prompt stronger gun regulations in TN? Across the US?
would sound genuine except you have an "A" rating with the NRA and voted against an assault rifle ban in 2013...
Their blood is on your hands. No civilian needs an assault rifle. #BloodyHands Prayers without acts are meaningless.
all talk and no action.  do something.
You voted NO to make background checks mandatory on gun sales.  Blood is on your hands. #disgraceful
.@SenAlexander - Then take action please.
@BroderickGreer @SenAlexander common sense gun control is not the slippery slope @NRA claims.
Your inaction led to these deaths.  #DoYourJob #GunSenseVoter #MassMurderer
Your sympathy means nothing if you won't ACT and #VoteForGunControl #InnocentLivesMatter #OrlandoNightclubShooting
Really sad event there.
you must accept responsibility for Orlando, ad you voted NO on mandatory background checks for gun sales
Rings hollow after voting against background checks #GunSense #PublicHealth 85% of Tn wants background checks. DO something!
Move to keep assault rifles out of the wrong hands, @SenAlexander.
you voted against the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act of 2015... 
If only you had the power to enforce bans on assault weapons. OH WAIT. Take your bullshit sympathy and leave office.
Lets see some common sense laws to stop citizens from getting assault weapons.  Have the guts to finally stand up to NRA!
and your hands cash checks written by the gun lobby. Shame.
, nope. Keep your angst. Your voting record is horrific - do better, then tweet about your heartache.
You do not have the right to offer sympathy to #Orlando after not voting for background checks after #SandyHook
Yet you voted AGAINST common-sense #backgroundchecks that might have prevented this. Keep your platitudes. Action is needed.
it's your and your colleague's fault
. @SenAlexander, less talk, more action. It’s past time to do something about rampant gun violence.
My heart goes out to the family and loved ones of those killed in last night’s horrific act of terror. -- Sen. Alexander
Then why did u vote NO to close the terror gap to make background checks mandatory on all gun sales?
Anti-LGBT rights Senator who voted to repeal an assault weapons ban. For some reason, your words ring hollow.
You are a senator, who has the power to make this less likely to occur again. Be brave, pass gun legislation. #Orlando
Lets see some action Monday morning, thank you
What heart?  The one that beats for the NRA?
be a decent human being!! work to protect the citizens you are supposed to serve.
you actually have the power to do something about all of this and here we are begging for you to make change
please do something about this! please vote for gun control! stop taking NRA money!!
Then do something about it. Ban all assault weapons and high capacity magazines. Otherwise, yours are just empty words.
But no doubt as a #VichyRepublican sycophant of the @DNC you'll still do nothing about #Radicalislam.
Time to declare war and kill these people where they stand No quarter given
.@SenAlexander if only you were in a position of power and influence to save lives by making it harder for anyone to get war machines.
