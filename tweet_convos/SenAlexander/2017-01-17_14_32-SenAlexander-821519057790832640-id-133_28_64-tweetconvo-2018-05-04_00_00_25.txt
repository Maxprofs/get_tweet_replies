If she had not bought you she would never be considered for this job by her education, training or experience.
Just like the coal jobs not coming back, who'll lose healthcare to fight their black lung. FRAUD.
if I even hear "lord Jesus Christ" in my kids public school I won't pay a dime in taxes, and no one else should.

"return authority to states" is proven recipe for disaster when it comes to educating all our kids
hahahahaha this is sooooooooooo funny. Really guys, you outdid yourselves on this one.
What record is that???? Millions of dollars donations!!
I may be wrong, having a public school education and all, but that means 30 haven't.
has no experience or connection with public education.  No experience managing money.
Yeah, because if grizzly bears do start attacking schools, Congress will be the last to take action.
she doesn't have anybody else's interest in mind but raping the EDU system and making herself some coin
No degree, no experience, nvr had a student loan, amazing what a $10 million gets u in DT'S org.
No.
'Make America STOOPIDER, Again!' Catchy Trumpian. KY kids will need KY gel w/you at that state helm.
Lying Mitch McConnell
Indeed. Man has sold his soul to Kochs. He has zero ethics. #SoullessMitch  @BetsyDeVos
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos She& her husband destroyed schools in MI. She needs to keep her dirty hands off our kids*********
Learning grammar and spelling would help her case a bit.
But how many states are there again? Eh, 2/5 ain't bad #zing #ThankYouObama #DeVosHearing #educationmatters
If Trump wants equality of ed. for inner city kids same as elsewhere, needs to ne same for whole country.
You can't have 50 different sets of standards of ed. & maintain quality for  all US or compare w/other countries.
Horrible interview. Unable/refused to answer basic questions about this dept. Either way, not qualified to run it.
Ur exactly whats wrong w/country.  States failed&we need Fed to ensure children get equal treatment.
You've lost all validity not 2 mention integrity. She's qualified for 1 job ... PTA BAKE SALE. # unqualified
Fuck that for a joke
Sorry,no experience in the public school system,only mentoring. Private institution experience only. Can't relate.
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos It's about GOP contributions not education Betsy's completely clueless & produced disastrous results
Having no understanding of public education's role in society is not a philosophy it's incompetence.
I don't care what governors think.They gave us CCS in the 1st place. #RepublicanParentsAgainstDevos
you stooge, she's #unfit and you've got to work hard not to see it. but the MAJORITY sees.
Be ASHAMED.  Betsy DeVos could not be LESS qualified for this job.
@BetsyDeVos is danger to all SpEd kids. She doesn't even know what IDEA is! SHE IS NOT QUALIFIED! #DumpDeVos
And keep bears out of our schools!!! #nobears #agrizzlyfutureforourchildren
20 out of 50? Seriously? I highly doubt that..
This woman will kill education like she did in Michigan.  Our children should not be used like this. Shame on you.
Are you kidding?  She can't even answer simple questions that would be asked in a teacher interview!
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos how much did she pay you both???
she demonstrated today that she doesn't know what any of that means.
No, she's an anti-gay, anti-public school troglodyte: http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/betsy-devos-education-trump-religion-232150 …

Sen. Al Franken discovers Trump Education Secretary nominee Betsy DeVos doesn't know the difference between proficiency and growth. 
And out guns in our schools b/c of grizzly attacks? Great idea! Endanger the lives of our children. Nuts!!!
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos liars
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos i am so glad i don't have children in school,  SO GLAD. Devos - bad pick
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos 
NO!
mconell you may re-unite america; we ALL think you're useless!
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos 20? That leaves a majority that don't support her.
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos Liar
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos And to the churches!
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos maybe the states shouldn't have that much authority if people like you are representing Americans.
She's against public education.
.@SenateMajLdr @SenAlexander If she truly believes school districts should not be required to comply with IDEA, she is not qualified.
@SenBennetCO thank you. We need to question this nominee. She is unqualified.
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mG8w9PcA-ig&sns=tw … via @youtube parents take back control.
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos And let blue states continue to cover the slack for failing red states #ignorance #FailHard
McConnell?  Really?  The man who obstructed POTUS for 8 years.   He's a joke.
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos and help them destroy public Rd
wasn't that created by Bush and no child left behind policy
DeVos will fight to put public money in private hands as she DESTROYS Public Education! #DumpDevos
HELL NO!!!
#NoToDevos
is woefully unqualified for this cabinet position. She never even attended public schooling. #KyConstituent
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos DeVos puts religion before education - keep separation of church & state - it keeps USA safe!
Can't even answer basic policy questions about public education. On-the-job training with our dime & kids.
What about ethics paperwork? Oh, and that very generous gift to @realDonaldTrump campaign? @SenateMajLdr @BetsyDeVos
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos @gop will fight to streamline the democratic process and let their big-time donor run our schools
Most of all, she will undermine public education and promote private interests and profiteers in education.
Where is her ethics paperwork Mitch? Why does she hate public schools so much?
Betsy DeVos' family gave $200 million to the GOP. For that kind of money, I"m sure you would endorse Attila the Hun.
Adorbs McConnell, you turtle looking minx! Good rule of thumb: take what Mitch says and do opposite. #TurtlePower
WELL ... finally here's someone, a Trump nominee no less, that McConnell might support.
#noExperience #noDegree #unqualified
great. Turn it all back. Blue states will do great. Red states will fail. That has been the historical pattern
Dims know controlling ed'n is a way 2 control populace N future.  Indoctrinate them young, & they'll spt U 4 life!
No ethics clearance and...
http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/betsy-devos-christian-schools-vouchers-charter-education-secretary …
or in other words...one of Trumps biggest donors is given a job in his inner circle. Pay for Play?
Completely unqualified for this post!
I'll help you with the math Moron ... 30 governors do not agree. Hard to fathom your motivation. $$$$?
and since it's now at the state level the Feds will no longer provide funding with my tax money?
@cowgirlup1a @BetsyDeVos delete your account, nothing you say or do is useful to anyone.
do you guys really think these things through?
so we are going to have 50 different versions of American history? 50 different sets of books to read in English?
You pair are outdated and out of touch politicians. Evil to the bone #BetsyDeVos
The Prince family is even more right leaning.
What did the others say ?
is the most under-qualified Sec. of Education ever.  No school experience or training in education.  #RejectDeVos
Yeah, just like your ACA repeal puts American people 1st. Stop this doublespeak. Show some respect for urself.
There's a reason why the federal govt is involved in state public education (Brown vs. Board)...
She's actually going to strip public money away from public schools and funnel them to rich families with kids at private schools.
DeVos wants a re-segration of our schools. We need to resist her classist and racists ideas for "reform".
the people will riot when she makes  u have to pay to educate ur children & pushes Christianity in the classroom
national standards r scary when trying to keep citizens stupid.
Baloney!
Thank God, I live in New York!
records exist.
So, Republican representatives will be allowed to cut funding to poor areas. Great... This is how America "MAGAs."
She owes $5.3M in fines for breaking OH election laws, going back to 2008. This alone disqualifies her.
Look at Detroit school system & how well that's going  My dislike and distrust of you grows every day #corrupt
1st move the agency headquarters to Nowhere alaska with a traitor park and dial up internet to eliminate staff
Save it! Strengthen Public Education for all or keep quiet!
forget about Amway scam lady. What do you intend to do about #TrumpTreason?

education and healthcare should be a state matter not a government matter
why is that good; because it destroys teachers unions and good teachers?
or else they will be shunned by the @GOP but who knows, they could be guided by their conscience
the Constitution clearly states that government shall have no say in education or healthcare.
how about the Russian hacks of election. Or r u in on it Sir. Americans deserve to know the truth
we had a hundred years of setting standards in our schools and accountability for school look at where we're at
DeVos has destroyed public education.
you really should change your name from "leader" to follower of Chester cheeto..resign or deal with me
What you mean is Mrs Devos paid to play .She knows nothing about schools Will we now teach Russia in schools?
Maybe we should all refuse to support this government. No taxation without qualified representation
yeah, that's what Illinois needs.  More shit to fuck up.  Great.  Thanks.
where are her ethics papers? You are such a hypocrite.  How do you sleep at night?  On a big pile of $$$
People wont think its a relief to watch you get a tax break while they lose coverage & cant afford to see a doc. #obamacare @SenateMajLdr
