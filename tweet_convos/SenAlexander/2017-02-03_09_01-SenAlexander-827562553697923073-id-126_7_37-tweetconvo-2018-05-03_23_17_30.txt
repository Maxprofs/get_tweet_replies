I'm so disappointed. You used to be respectable but voting for unqualified DeVos is disgusting & unforgivable. You're corrupt.
Don't listen to her, Lamar.
imposter.
are you kidding? #TNTeachersAreWatching
- caring about an issue DOES NOT equal knowledge or experience.
I have a long memory-See u @the polls-Oh just in case u don't get it-Q ur intelligence with ur votes - I won't be voting for u
VOTE NO TO DeVos!!!! She is not qualified and you are going to get voted out. You are not representing your state. Only TRUMP
and that is what - no experience?
Quit trying to jam this unqualified ignoramus through! Americans - Democrats & Republicans alike - DON'T WANT HER
pay to play! Shameful. We are rising and will vote accordingly. Devos is a religious extremist #CNP
Respectfully, unless a president has a degree in education, he's not qualified for this job.  #NotoDeVos
has 43,200 reasons to speak out for DeVos...and to recuse himself from the final vote.
Clearly, neither of you are paying a bit of attention to us.  We will remember your lack of service.
the only quality she has is being a donor with deep pockets. TN does NOT want DeVos!
Well then you apparently have very low standards.
you both need to have a rational head on your shoulders. Shame on you for valuing money over children.
You need to stop @SenAlexander justifying your support of someone absolutely unqualified for the job! Oh wait she mentored at public school
she isnt even close to qualified a piece of bread could do a better job #holdthefloor #TheResistance #NoonDeVos
what does she have but $$$$?
he was paid a bunch of $$$$. Come on @SenatorBurr. You are about to make more teachers leave #NC.
how much did she contribute to your campaign?  Only way an intelligent person would think she was fit!!
I'm a democrat and this nominee my republican friends and I agree on. Pick up the phone and listen to your constituents.
I am more qualified for this position than Betsy Devos. Election time please vote Alexander & Burr out of office.
"Qualities" include not knowing the difference between "growth" and "achievement". Are you seriously voting yes?!
Betsy Devos is not even remotely qualified to run a govt agency, let alone one she has actively opposed for years
You aren't choosing a prez: this vote is for the ed sec. She has few qualifications for that role. #VoteNoDeVos
Please stop this sad campaign. Your constituents know DeVos is unqualified. #VoteNoDevos
nope. Not true. Which other Pres nominated someone who'd NEVER been to or worked in public schools or admin?
No, no, no!!! Shame on you! She is extremely unqualified! 
I am ashamed she was even considered for this position.
shame on you. She'd be s travesty to those with special needs and those in the field.
Vote no on Devos. She is the wrong choice.
What was the success of her plan?  "She tried" isn't good enough for our kids.  Someone must have better ideas.
you're kidding. Apparently "rich with zero experience" is what passes as qualifications to you?
@BetsyDeVos  Teaching experience (not mentoring) would be a good place to start. And knowing IDEA. #noDevos
sounds to me like she is overqualified for the job. We don't need her. Vote no on DeVos.
wow you are really making yourself bad supporting her. You're horrible
Pls don't allow our children's education to be handed over to private companies and for-profit corps #FixPublicEd
you got this one wrong. Very unqualified. You just let money buy a power position. We are watching
C'mon, Lamar, do you really think we're that ignorant? She's not qualified. Saying she is makes you look corrupt.
.@SenAlexander .@SenatorBurr Incompetence? Lack of qualifications? Oh yeah, maybe you're talking about her family's donations to the GOP?
.@SenAlexander @SenatorBurr well DeVos matches qualifications of this Pres. past? Not so much
can you name a few? Be better, the American people aren't as naive as you think they are.
Some presidents have looked for experience, knowledge, competence, a record of public service, not just $.
you got to be kidding me!!
under those qualifications I could be Sec. of Education.  And I've been both a teacher and a principal.
Was Burr payed to not ask her any questions? #Devos Watch for yourself: UNQUALIFIED http://www.help.senate.gov/hearings/nomination-of-betsy-devos-to-serve-as-secretary-of-education â€¦
Other things you might look for in a nominee are experience & knowledge of the job & laws. #Devos #IDEA
@BetsyDeVos        UNQUALIFIED. Gotta them thar bears out of schools. Quick, get me My AR 15.
how exactly do you sleep at night? How can you look at your children? Grandchildren?
I call BS. @BetsyDeVos has NO educational experience, NONE. #DumpDeVos
she has no qualities we'd look for.
you are blatantly ignoring the voice of your constituency. I'm incredibly frustrated with your disregard for us.
how about experience? knowledge of the system? Those are not qualities you want for highest positions? Really?
no education experience, particularly public education? This is for the kids...and I don't even have any.
you mean incompetent, out of touch and unqualified? Sounds about right. #DumpDevos
by your admission this morning, outsiders have influenced ed for 30+ yrs, when will u learn? #noDeVos #dumpDeVos
DeVos will hurt those in the rural areas of TN. Demonstrate character and do what is right - vote no.
ignorance is a quality the Senate looks for?
How much are you all getting paid to perpetuate this blatant falsehoods?
she is not qualified
as in, "dangerously unqualified" ???  #nobetsydevos
DeVos has never been a public school student, parent OR teacher, + diverting tax $$ kills public schools.
Betsy DeVos's lack of knowledge regarding disability law for our spec ed students makes her highly unqualified
Stop embarassing yourselves, Senators. Vote No as your constituents are demanding.
this lady was born to billionaires - third shift plant and retail clerk work citation is BANANAS.
why don't you listen to the PEOPLE who you serve, instead of the major donors who have no experience in education
she is UNQUALIFIED. Period. Shame on you - "at least she tried" is an INSANE case for the job.
Hi Lamar, I've attached a pic reflecting your views, can you make this your profile pic? Thanks! 
- I'm assuming the quality you are referring to is LOTS AND LOTS OF MONEY!!!!
no this concerned citizen
qualities but not qualifications! The people you represent are against her! #VoteNoDevos
23 Senators received funds from the DeVos family. Murkowski voted the will of her constituents, unlike most.
@john_d_miles @The_Devin_Green Everyone, here are instructions for faxing him Lamar: http://bit.ly/2k2Bj4G 
like big, big money? And connections to more money?
All due respect Senators, Ms. DeVos does not possess any qualities which qualify her to be Sec Ed.
What qualities, wealth? I knew the Republican Party was self-centered but this is crazy. #NeverDevos
are you even paying attention to your constituents, Lamar? We DO NOT want DeVos. Stop pandering to her $$
Everytime Lamar shares something about DeVos is another door I'll knock on to boot him out. TN DOESN'T WANT DEVOS
http://www.spectacle.org/595/lamar.html 
You must be kidding!. She has NO qualifications as a professional in education.
what about the qualities you'd look for in Education specifically? She has none of those. #resist
plagiarism ?
yes, yes, yes!
confirm please! Let's get this train moving.
the VAST majority of  @SenatorBurr constituents are AGAINST #DeVos but, you know, why listen to them? #politicalHACK
NC is disappointed in @SenatorBurr for his endorsement of this unqualified nominee for Education Secretary.
did he use the .? for this?

I donate to better groups, do I know anything of managemt or participation ribbon?
#TNVoter here, that dog won't hunt.
and I am sure the $43,200 DeVos contribution @SenatorBurr received has nothing to do with his vote.
TN children deserve better and you know they can use all the help they can get #DevosNo
Tennessee overwhelmingly opposes her so why are you in her pocket?
Billions to contribute to your party?
You are shining examples of everything that is wrong with the government. #TNVoter
literally the only qualities he named have to do with her having a lot of money. Not a qualification.
.@SenAlexander @SenatorBurr Reread this: is she up for #POTUS? And if not, are you sure you're looking at the right file? #NoonDeVos
dont care what ur buddies say, esp. 1's on Devos payroll. @SenatorBurr's opinion worth PAC millions. how much ur support cost?
.@SenAlexander @SenatorBurr Please direct staff to answer phones instead of tweeting. You might be surprised by what you hear. #NoonDeVos
Yeah, #BetsyDeVos paid him $43,200 to say that. #DumpDevos
Need an account of how much DeVos-Prince-Blackwater SuperPAC $$ the GOP senators getting to vote Yes
DeVos is unqualified. Vote for her and lose your seat in the next election!
what? incompetence and money? you're embarrassing us.
to clarify, you're embarrassing YOURSELF and betraying your constituents for $. unacceptable.
thank you Senator Burr, we need such a person to reform our ED systems in USA and territories.
I think "TEACHING EXPERIENCE" would be a good quality? Oh and don't mind the WHITE NATIONALISTS giving you power.
.@SenAlexander @SenatorBurr The "we" referenced above isn't the view of your constituents. Please pick up the phone and listen. #NoonDeVos
NO!!! Unless unqualified is the new standard.
swing and a miss.
