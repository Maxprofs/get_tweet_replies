@SenAlexander Obama made many claims as fact that are bold faced lies about O care!Americans were mislead for the purpose to fraud & deceive
@SenAlexander Sebeliusneedstobefired
@SenAlexander @chucktodd GOP wants to get rid of Sebelius so they can block new nomination. Dems helped GOP when Bush Medicare plan failed.
“@SenAlexander: The president should ask Secretary Sebelius to resign.”   Win an election, then you can decide who should be in the cabinet.
@SenAlexander she won listen. Just like you don't listen when TN tells you to resign. #TCOT #BeatLamar #RINO
@SenAlexander President Obama Intentionally & Knowingly told America as fact"O"care is affordable!Keep your Dr!Save you money!Create Jobs!
@SenAlexander Courts should consider that since Obama knowingly & willingly set out to intentionally fraud Americans.Remove "O"care as a law
@SenAlexander Courts are barred from turning Corruption into a law! For Obama care to remain a law means the Courts have committed a Crime!
@SenAlexander Obama care cannot be made a law based on the fact Obama Intentionally corrupted Obama care facts as being the truth.
@SenAlexander @chucktodd I don't agree. She's not an IT expert. Give her a chance to work through this.
@SenAlexander @chucktodd Maybe you should ask for the resignation of the House GOP who cost the country 24 Billion you ass hat!
@AuntieMEK @SenAlexander @chucktodd RWs look for any way to be negative
@SenAlexander Do you seriously believe they intended it to work? They wanted single payer. It's a feature, not a bug.
As a #Republican @SenAlexander doesn't have clean hands-Iraq, recession, etal. Fix the problem not the blame. & @chucktodd knows better
@SenAlexander Why don't YOU call for her to resign?  Would that be too strong a position for you to take?
RT @SenAlexander "The president should ask Secretary Sebelius to resign." Agreed!
@SenAlexander 
I would like to suggest tht YOU resign Senator
@SenAlexander You should resign.
@SenAlexander @chucktodd You should do your job and pass some laws.
@SenAlexander   You should resign, you have been on government teat long enough 40+ yrs
@SenAlexander @chucktodd America should ask Congress to resign.
@SenAlexander @chucktodd And the Senate would readily confirm a replacement, right?
@SenAlexander @chucktodd  And why should the President listen to you obstruction repuglicans? U don't want ACA 2 be a success. STFU Twat.
@SenAlexander @chucktodd GOP has been so destructive they are no longer viewed as offering anything of value to this country.
@SenAlexander FIRE & SUE HER 4 COST OF REPAIRS, HAVE THE IRS SIEGE ALL HER ASSETS! ADD 2 LAWSUIT ALL WHO VOTED 4 OBAMACARE FREEEZ E ASSETS
@SenAlexander @chucktodd Another negative from GOP. Burn it down mentality which has ruined them. Hatred of POTUS not a strategy.
@SenAlexander No Senator, You should resign!
@SenAlexander @chucktodd Who asks him to?
@SenAlexander @chucktodd All those who voted to shutdown the gvmt and cost the country $24b, should give back their salaries to pay for it.
@SenAlexander @chucktodd He's reduced to being a gopher for those now in charge,and forced her to continue to stand there&take the pummeling
@SenAlexander @chucktodd U should Quit As well RTWING ahole
@SenAlexander @chucktodd That is just stupid... Don't listen to Repubs they think destroying the dollar is a good idea.
@SenAlexander @chucktodd Hey, maybe you should shut down the government until Sebelius resigns. I bet that would be a great strategy!
@SenAlexander @EdMorrissey No. He should fire her.
@SenAlexander That would be WAY to easy.
I'm sure your fellow Repubs would never block a replacement, right? “@SenAlexander: The president should ask Secretary Sebelius to resign.”
@SenAlexander @chucktodd along with the ideologues that just hurt many & damaged the country!
@chucktodd @SenAlexander I'd put her approv rat over repubs in congress any day. Glitches in 1st ever Nat HC system vs shutting down govt.
@chucktodd @SenAlexander / Right! And, who would you suggest as a replacement?
@SenAlexander @chucktodd He should ask you scoundrels to resign too.
@SenAlexander @chucktodd Sure, right after you do it Senator.
@SenAlexander who did you ask to resign when medicare D was a bust?? @chucktodd
@SenAlexander @chucktodd Your ass,!give it up you stupid ass.
@SenAlexander @SmallBizOnHill You first!!
@SenAlexander you should resign.
@SenAlexander @chucktodd OH, you're both here. WE would like YOU BOTH, to resign, also; hack Senator, and NBC's chief soap-opera tabloidist.
@SenAlexander @chucktodd Stop bitching about the freaking website. We have massive problems in this country. DO SOMETHING or resign yourself
@SenAlexander @chucktodd In addition, the President needs to get more involved with the job of chief executive, he is too hands off.
@SenAlexander @chucktodd Actually, the President should resign.
@SenAlexander @chucktodd more poison from the Right.  Why don't you focus on helping Americans instead of constantly seeking to score points
@SenAlexander Why? It would be better if GOP governors, TN included, would expand Medicaid & set up exchange instead of dumping on fed.
@SenAlexander @chucktodd Why would you ask?  I thought he was the boss....or is firing someone in the GOVT a no no??
@SenAlexander @FreeBeacon You have no room to complain.  You voted to fund it.
@SenAlexander @chucktodd That's not going to happen.
@SenAlexander @chucktodd How does that fix anything this is a technical matter-stop playing politics!
@SenAlexander @chucktodd And who should take her place? Are you concerned with the #ACA ( insert laugh here) or someone going under the bus
@SenAlexander @chucktodd   The American people should help EVERY REPUBLICAN resign ASAP....
@SenAlexander @chucktodd I wonder why these ideas weren't discussed when Med part D had bad rollout. Oh right, R politics
“@SenAlexander: The president should ask Secretary Sebelius to resign.” No, she's not issue, it's GOP road blocks for years. @LatinosOFA
@SenAlexander AND YOU SHOULD RESIGN ALSO & TAKE CORKER WITH YOU
@SenAlexander @chucktodd who resigned for Medicare Part D?  Change management is hard, and you want to force it during rollout?
@SenAlexander @chucktodd hahahaha
Damn that primary challenge. RT @SenAlexander: The president should ask Secretary Sebelius to resign.
@SenAlexander @chucktodd You should resign for the GOP shut down of government.
@SenAlexander America should ask all the congressmen who wasted over 24B dollars of our money to resign, immediately.
@SenAlexander good luck in your primary.
@SenAlexander @chucktodd Ay ay ay!!!
Sure, but that doesn't make #Obamacare disappear, nor its escalating problems @SenAlexander @chucktodd Prez should ask Sec.Sebelius 2 resign
Why don't you ask @SenMikeLee and @SenTedCruz resign too, bitch! "@SenAlexander: The president should ask Secretary Sebelius to resign."
@SenAlexander @chucktodd The American people should ask Congress to resign. You are, collectively, a total disgrace.
@SenAlexander LOL what
@SenAlexander @chucktodd When @GOP tells @SenTedCruz to shut the F up & saying he'll block appointments because he couldn't defund the #ACA
@SenAlexander @chucktodd So the GOP can block any future appointment?
@SenAlexander @chucktodd maybe you and your GOP colleagues should resign for being Hypocrites.
@SenAlexander @chucktodd Nonsense. Lamar, behave yourself. You sound like a Tea Party representative.
@SenAlexander @chucktodd I know its hard for you to have A Black man leading this Country,learn to live with it!
@SenAlexander @chucktodd I would be happy to see that.  Hold people accountable.  Reward good people with good stuff.  Ditch bottom feeders
@SenAlexander may we request the same of you?
@SenAlexander You first.
@senalexander @chucktodd  go suck a lemon.
@SenAlexander @chucktodd And the same could be said about @SpeakerBoehner. So what's the point?
@SenAlexander @chucktodd And the GOP should ask Ted Cruz to resign
@SenAlexander @FreeBeacon there should be a whole binder of pink slips to hand out.
@SenAlexander @EdMorrissey you're right, but nevertheless, i'd like to ask you to resign, senator, your performance lately has been pathetic
@SenAlexander @chucktodd  But if she resigned the site wouldn't get fixed because Lindsay Graham is going to block any future appointments?
@SenAlexander Your constituents should ask you to resign.
@SenAlexander @chucktodd . Disagree. NO Victories. NO Concessions. NO Satisfaction Of Resignation Of Secretary Sebelius Going Into 2014.
@SenAlexander @chucktodd All of you should resign.
you first “@SenAlexander: The president should ask Secretary Sebelius to resign.”
RT @SenAlexander: The president should ask Secretary Sebelius to resign.
