@SenAlexander A national gun registry sounds like a very good idea. Evidently your bosses in the NRA thought otherwise.
@DeirdreS @SenAlexander A National Gun registry will never be a good idea.
@parkerrvrgirl Why not? I'm asking seriously.
@DeirdreS Government is never the answer. Research Hilter's takeover of Germany, you will see a lot of perils to what is happening here now
@ParkerRvrGirl Beeep! We have a winner! Godwin's law has now been proven in the context of this discussion!
@SenAlexander nothing to be proud of
@SenAlexander we've heard your nonsensical argument. your turn @SenBobCorker. Please explain why you let your state and country down again.
@SenAlexander The blood of Innocents is on your hands, Senator. You are prostitute, owned and pimped by the NRA.
@SenAlexander  You will pay at the polls. 90% of Americans want this legislation approved. We will prevail by defeating you. Hit the road.
@SenAlexander You are absolutely correct! Thank you.
@SenAlexander SHAME ON YOU!!!!!
@SenAlexander  This bill took no law abiding citizen's guns and maintained 2nd ammend. rights. Shame on you for failing Tennessee families.
@SenAlexander shame on you. #coward
Disingenuous bullshit->  @SenAlexander: Voted against Toomey-Manchin background check amdmt b/c it could evolve into a natl gun registry
@reubenrock Yup. Fucker.
.@SenAlexander With all due respect Mr. Senator, bullshit. The legislation specifically forbade it. Care to try again?
@SenAlexander Do you work for the people of Tennessee or the NRA?
@SenAlexander you clearly did not read the bill, it makes creation of a registery a felony with a sentence of up to 15 year imprisonement
@SenAlexander A no vote based on conjectures rather than the actual content of the amdmt? Do your constituents know you vote this way?
@SenAlexander Bullshit, Lamar.
@SenAlexander 100 high school student, zero have a problem with background checks. These are your future voters.
@SenAlexander Shame on you sir, you have let us all down by refusing to support what 90% of the country does.
@SenAlexander Shame on you for supporting lobbyists rather than listening to and protecting your constituents.
@SenAlexander I think that vote was shameful and makes me embarrassed to be an American today.There was no gun registry - just cowardice.
@SenAlexander I understand that the bill strickly forbids this.  If you cannot be honest with the voters, how do you justify the vote?
@SenAlexander No, It does not have anything to do with gun registries. You are being duped by the NRA and you need to be smarter than that.
@SenAlexander I'm sure the former and many future victims of gun violence will appreciate your support of the NRA and rw ideologues
@SenAlexander shame on you Senator for voting no on the background check amdmt!
@SenAlexander you have failed the people and the great state of TN.
@SenAlexander that's a stupid reason to vote against something. It's like voting against a Senator b/c he could evolve into mental illness
@SenAlexander You should be ashamed of your votes in the Senate yesterday. A gun registry? Did you even read the bill? Who do you represent?
@SenAlexander This makes you a fool or a liar or both.
@SenAlexander i'll not vote for you again.
@SenAlexander you are intentionally ignorant of facts if you really think this leads to a registry. Shameful embarrassment to our state.
@SenAlexander Shame on you for your vote - you do not represent the people -you made a sham of our system
@SenAlexander no it could not. Read the text. OR if you're unable have someone read it to you.
@SenAlexander You are a coward and a liar. You placed the comforts of your office above your country and the safety of its citizens.
@SenAlexander Weak excuse.
@SenAlexander so disappointing that you don't respect the safety of your country over your desire to anonymously own a gun. Terrible.
@SenAlexander completely disgusted by your total lack of courage!
@SenAlexander SHAME ON YOU!
@SenAlexander Shame on you. #RememberNewtown
@SenAlexander you should have voted for it.  Why would you vote against such a common sense amendment.
@SenAlexander did you read the bill? #bloodmoney
@SenAlexander Please don't give Harry Reid any more power . Every single Lib agenda starts innocently enough to reel in the beginner vote.
@SenAlexander because the fanatics at the NRA said so.  Not!
@SenAlexander What a lie.  You should be ashamed of yourself.
@SenAlexander In fact, the amendment included a prison sentence of up to 15 years for creating a registry. But you know that.
@SenAlexander Are you joking?!  Nat. Gun Registry?! Sounds like boogie man straw man argument.  Meanwhile, kids continue to die from guns.
@SenAlexander As a moderate I have voted for you in each election. Today, you lost my vote.
@SenAlexander, Tell me how it makes sense that you need a background check at a gun dealer, but not for a gun purchase over the internet?
@SenAlexander "b/c it could easily evolve into a national gun registry" is #NRA propaganda.  You voted against the American people.
@SenAlexander POTUS said that was a lie, it specifically outlawed a national registry.
@SenAlexander THAT is a lie and you know it. The legislation  specifically prohibited a registry in fact.
@SenAlexander That is unfortunate and short sighted.
@SenAlexander Thank you for voting to protect our 2nd amendment rights!
@SenAlexander Shame on you re your vote on gun control.
@SenAlexander Your vote is shameful and a national disgrace.
@SenAlexander #Shameonyou
@SenAlexander Stop lying about the registry to cover yourself. Get out of bed with the gun lobby and vote for what your constituents want!
@SenAlexander You are another GOP fool that will loose his seat you have no minority support no women will support you go to hell xxxhole
@SenAlexander I think a national gun registry would be a great idea--especially if the alternative is the killing of innocent children.
@SenAlexander I am devastated by your actions. What is there to fear with a gun registry? If it can save one life of a child it is worth it.
.@SenAlexander - Shame on you!
@SenAlexander You have sold your integrity to the NRA. You have betrayed the people for a handful of silver. #SHAME #INFAMY
@SenAlexander Pants on Fire!
@SenAlexander Shameful thank you for proving that congress can be bought hope you received a fair price from NRA
@SenAlexander You are a pawn of the NRA
@SenAlexander How does a national gun registery violate anyones 2nd amend rights?  Shame on you.
.@SenAlexander Shame on you!
@SenAlexander The argument didn't fail. Your ability to think logically did. You're another sell-out to the NRA. Faust deals abound.
@SenAlexander Idiot.
@SenAlexander The amendment specifically protected against any registry. You voted against it b/c of $ and the NRA. Shame on you.
@SenAlexander  Who are you representing? Clearly not the 90% of the pop who supported this amndmt.Shame on you! I hope it was worth it! $$$
@SenAlexander Thanks for voting for the NRA and the gun manufacturers today against the overwhelming will of the people. SHAME SHAME
@SenAlexander shameful misinterpretation and shame on u4 voting no! Enjoy blood of innocent people on your hands! #MomsDemandAction
@SenAlexander  Manchin bill-Spineless & hypocritcal How can you sleep at night. Or how much is the gun lobby paying for your vote Art Wilson
@SenAlexander Thanks for so obviously voting in your own self interest. Makes it real easy for me to take my vote elsewhere in 2014 #USA
@SenAlexander Disappointed in your vote.
@SenAlexander Really??? that's your reason...
@SenAlexander Thanks for your votes today!
@SenAlexander  Shame on you.
@SenAlexander BULLSHIT! You voted with your wallet in mind, and not the people of this state, or of this country.  Go fuck yourself.
@SenAlexander shame on you Senator for voting no on the background check amdmt!
@jpmaheu @SenAlexander I agree... voted with their wallets, all of them did.  No doubt big fat paycheck in the post from the NRA tomorrow.
@SenAlexander You could EASILY EVOLVE into a human being but I don't see that happening either. Shame on you
@SenAlexander  You should be ashamed. Get real. This was most definitely a Republican stand.
@SenAlexander And I'll be voting against you at the next opportunity. Embarrassed by your Senate today.
@SenAlexander @SenBobCorker disappointed that your reasons are really about what the NRA could do to your reelection. @CNN @MarshaBlackburn
@SenAlexander how much did you get paid by the @NRA ?
@SenAlexander good job, now every terrorist, domestic or otherwise along with mentally ill can continue to buy guns unabated. be proud.
@SenAlexander. Disappointed. I thought you were the one with common sense. Guess I was wrong.
@SenAlexander U are on the wrong side sir.  The people WILL elect lawmakers who WILL get gun safety bills passed. We are relentless.
.@SenAlexander and this citizen of TN thanks you b/c it would indeed evolve into a national gun registry. Mental illness should be the focus
@SenAlexander 
I am glad you woke up. Newtown would not have been prevented by a measure such as this. #2A not up for debate.
@SenAlexander It is such a sad day when an intelligent and respected Senator is entirely duped by the lies of the gun lobby.
@SenAlexander You didn't have to vote as you did, Lamar. The NRA cannot hurt you in TN. Just disappointed, my friend.
@SenAlexander Thank you for defending the #Constitution. #Respect #2ndAmendment
@SenAlexander THANK YOU
Thank you, @SenAlexander. But you voted to bring gun control to the floor and are responsible for restrictions that pass. #Protect2A
@SCF This amendment was no threat to the second amendment. You are, quite simply, liars.
@SenAlexander Very sad to hear this.
@SenAlexander Weak excuse on an insane hypothetical. This isn't about #2A rights at all. You've failed Tennessee.
@SenAlexander many thanks senator.  You saved the day.
@SenAlexander Now, don't let Reid tack the amendment onto any other bill either, like they did with Real ID!!!
@SenAlexander No, you caved to political pressure.
@SenAlexander way to go Lamar!!Thank you!!
@SenAlexander Thank you Sir!
@SenAlexander thank God for some common sense
