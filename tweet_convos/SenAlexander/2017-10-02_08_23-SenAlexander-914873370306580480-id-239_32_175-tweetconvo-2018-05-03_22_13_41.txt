Prayers don't save lives gun control would!
Really?  Automatic weapons have been illegal for nearly a century, but didn't stop this.
Please support gun control legislation.  Prayers without action are meaningless.  Stop accepting NRA money and take a stand.
With all due respect, prayers don't help. Acting to prevent automatic assault rifles from getting N2 ordinary people's hands would.
It is infuriating to see this when you have done everything possible to hold back meaningful gun control. You're an accessory. Do something.
We need strong gun regulations, not prayers after people are gunned down on our streets. Please do your job and stop taking money from NRA.
There's blood on your hands.
Donate the money you received from the NRA to help the victims.
Thoughts & prayers don't really do much. Do you bathe in your #NRAbloodmoney? Here's a country song - a little less talk & a lot more action
@SenAlexander You blocked gun control measures in 2016 following the Orlando shooting that could have prevented this. #GunContolNow
We need common sense reforms. These things won't stop without change; have some courage and vote!
Should we send pics of what gunshot victims look like, photos of what a bullet does to the human head and body, so you can keep praying?
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Prayers are good. Gun control is better. Banning assault weapons best. No one needs assault weapons but our military & swat teams.
Were you praying when you deposited $14,850 from the NRA?
Lamar, Lamar, Lamar. We DON'T want your prayers we want your action. Stop taking $ from @NRA and start doing your job to protect Americans.
There is something deeply hypocritical about praying for a problem you are unwilling to resolve #standuptotheNRA #sensiblegunlawsplease
#GunControlNow
We need gun control - background checks.
Prayers?
You took $14,850 from #NRA to forever lax gun laws.
You are #Complicit in #LasVegasMassacre
Our prayers are with Las Vegas and all of those affected by last night's devastating attack.
While you're praying you might want to ask forgiveness for your vote against the Assault Weapons ban.  Blood on ur hands, NRA $ in pocket.
Your prayers have done nothing to prevent shootings from occurring. Introduce increased gun control legislation, Senator.
Amen
.@SenAlexander, even God is getting tired of your prayers. He wants you, @SenateGOP & @HouseGOP to do something to prevent these massacres
We, the people, need your vote for realistic gun laws not your sympathy!
10k means little to campaign. It's the vote. Conservatives tie gun ownership to patriotism like some bullshit macho brand. Voters eat it up
How much blood money have *you* received from the NRA terrorist organization?
He took at least $5,000 from that terrorist organization, which is why all he can give are prayers. Americans die & he does nothing.
WaPo says $14,850
Prayers are good but WE NEED TO STOP THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN!  Get inspired to create some common sense legislation TODAY!
How about our laws reflect what we are praying for?  Gun control now.
Prayers, like you, are useless. You are complicit in all gun murders because you can do something about them, but choose to do nothing
What policy changes do you plan to make to prevent this in the future? We are watching closely.
Amen
.@SenAlexander took $5,857+ from @NRA to pray about gun violence but do nothing about it. 
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Your thoughts and prayers are meaningless.  Do something about it.  Stop taking NRA blood money.
Thoughts and prayers is the most hackneyed phrase out of Congress. Listen to 90% of your constituents and do what they put you there for.
Be like Australia
I pray with you Sen Alexander. After that, it’s time to get to work on reducing gun violence on our country. Sick and tired of no action.
Your "prayers" are useless. Spare us your phony piety.  Increasing gun violence shows your god is NOT LISTENING TO YOU.
Prayers not followed by action are merely passing thoughts. Quit wasting our times, money, and lives.
We don’t pay you to pray.  How ‘bout legislating?  I’m a constituent.  Sick of feeling unsafe in my own country.  Do. Something. Now.
Your "prayers" mean NOTHING given the fact that you voted against closing gun purchase loopholes. Get off the NRA's ass and do something!

Every Member of Congress Who Took Money From the NRA and Tweeted 'Thoughts and Prayers' to Las Vegas @splinter_news http://ow.ly/9SsB30fAAVY 
Pray today and do something about it at the start of am session
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Get military weapons off the market!
Your prayers are not enough! Do better, you can prevent this. Approve gun reform! The blood is on your hands!
You voted to let mentally ill people own guns & against stronger background checks. Your prayers mean nothing.
Who voted against gun control? Joe and Mika read their names http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/who-voted-against-gun-control … #BloodOnYourHands
Save your empty words. How much has the NRA spent in support of your career? Will you take one different substantive action because of this?
I have a priest whose job is praying. Your job is passing gun control legislation. Do your job! Jesus weeps for your hypocritical prayers.
Don’t need prayers. Need GUN CONTROL.
Do more than pray!  Make it as difficult to get a gun as it is to get a safe abortion!
How dare you sully the memory of those lost with your inaction. #SendBackTheBloodMoney

We need to change how we deal with guns.
It should be harder and their should be more monitoring and accountability
What about voting on taking away people's healthcare?
Once your prayers are done, actually do something in the here and now. People are dying, Senator, & you have the position to do something.
And yet?
Let's take some action on it.
Your are a hypocrite.
The NRA thanks you for this statement and for being their puppet.
BS
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Praying will not stop this
Action needed not prayers! Stand up to the NRA and come up w/reasonable gun control! #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Prayers don't do much. How about standing up against the NRA? Grow a pair. That would show you care
If we want prayers we will call in he nuns.  Do your job and pass sensible gun legislation.
Did you accept $$ from the NRA?  If so you too put your money before your prayers.
Your cowardice to act cannot be whitewashed by prayers. None of this ends unless you do something to stop it.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Your prayers are meaningless because you put guns into the hands of terrorists. You take NRA $ so share responsibility for the deaths in LV!
Prayers don't stop bullets.
Thank you for your kindness. Better yet, oppose the NRA Send back the money, vote down the gun silencer bill #SendBackTheBloodMoney
It’s time to move beyond prayers and well wishes.
"Republicans" = gun lobby. If Sandy Hook didn't change your fetish with unfettered gun access, nothing will.
Prayer is great, Lamar, but when do you guys tell the NRA you've grown a pair and will be taking action instead of more of their money?
#SendBackTheBloodMoney #GunControlNow #NRATerrorism
Stop praying and start legislating. Start by opposing wider access to silencers.
God helps those who help themselves. Legislate to prevent this or your prayers mean nothing. #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Keep praying like that's gonna help...
Yeah, your prayers mean nothing to those subjected to blood sacrifice. Where is your leadership in banning such guns? reject gun lobby $.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
You voted against the assault weapons ban. 
Your words mean nothing.
Senator, Does the blood money from the .@NRA block the screams ?, Help you wash the blood off your hands? 

Can you face God and explain?
I think we can safely say, the @GOP is a Terrorist Sponsoring Organization.
Your prayers do nothing. Your lack of action allows this to happen over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, & over you coward
Endorsements from undertakers, casket makers, embalmers, urn makers, petroleum industry who's fuels move and cremate the dead.
Let's guess how much the NRA put in YOUR pocket.
At least $14,850 according to @washingtonpost
Prayers are useless. You guys do it after every mass shooting.
Do something about this one.
Pass gun control legislation.
Praise the Lord! that NRA donation has cleared!
Accomplice #SendBackTheBloodMoney
You took almost $6k from NRA recently, right? Screw prayers. Do something. People are dying.
Do you cut & paste this chickenshit statement, change the venue then post it to twitter each time the U.S. has a gun related mass murder ?
Big deal, you accept money from the gun lobby so spare us your platitudes. Do something, talk is cheap.
It would be better if you didn't support the NRA and vote for silencers on these weapons.
save us your #thoughtsandprayers, #SendBackTheBloodMoney and get to work on #GunControlNow
Empty. Hollow. Complicit.
REMINDER: 41 Republicans blocked sensible gun legislation, right after the Sandy Hook Massacre.

#LasVegas #LasVegasMassacre #GunControlNow 
Then take it a step beyond prayer.   Vote no on silencers
Save your prayers. They don't bring back loved ones. Take action. #GunControlNow
SHUT UP, nobody wants your pathetic prayers.  We just want you OUT!
It's obvious your prayers aren't working. You accept money from the NRA, this makes you complicit in the deaths of children, and adults!!
Your prayers mean nothing. The NRA is a terrorist group. Their claim to counter with MORE GUNS doesn’t work. Ask any combat vet.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Stuff prayers. Put thoughts into action to stop this madness. Otherwise, you're a coward who values money and power over people's lives.

Too bad you didn't think of victims B4 you sold out to #NRA. Pretty sure you're blood $$ won't get you into Heaven, Lamar!
Prayers are all we need.

Yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.
#GiveBacktheBloodMoney
I don't believe you.
.@SenAlexander took $5,857+ from @NRA to pray about gun violence but do nothing about it. 

Urge him to #SendBackTheBloodMoney #GUNSKill 
"I voted against the so-called assault weapons ban because it clearly infringes on Second Amendment rights," said Sen. Alexander. #enough
You’ve received over $5k from the NRA, #SendBackTheBloodMoney
The money from those who abetted last nights attack is in your campaign account
Prayers are pointless. A benevolent god would have intervened before the bullets flew. We need stricter gun control and enforcement.
How much @NRA $ have you accepted to date? Thoughts & prayers have done nothing to end this scourge. As your constituent I demand action.
Prayers do nothing. Legislation does.
Love this tweet! #vegas #guncontol
Prayers won't do. Not even close. Get to work on sane gun regulation. Otherwise blood is on your hands.
Senator Alexander, let s keep the focus on the real thing here....evil and hate. We need our leaders united and working together for us.
#EnoughIsEnough
Your prayers are worthless. You took blood money from the NRA. Ban machine guns, or stop pretending you care about murder more than the NRA
#SendBackTheBloodMoney if you care so much.
Fuck your thoughts and prayers. You took blood money from the NRA. This is on you.
If prayer is an appropriate response to gunfire, go stand down range during target practice, praying away and let's see how well you do.
But what about your thoughts?  Aren't you required to say "thoughts and prayers"?
Why don't you offer effective gun control policies instead? Your prayers are hypocrisy soaked in the filthy lucre of your gun lobby donors.
I pray that you reject gun lobby money and enact meaningful gun legislation.
Senator Alexander, you've taken $14,850 from the NRA. Was it worth it? This couple is from Tennessee.
I don't know Brian, the weapon appears to have been a machine gun which has been banned since before the Senator was born.  Suggestions?
When's the next NRA check coming in?
Not sure, since automatic weapons have been illegal since before your grandparents were born I doubt it would make any difference.
we dont want your prayers!!! we want your action. This cannot be the best we can do!!!
How's about you return the $5,857+ you received from the @NRA? Does that come with automatic thoughts and prayers? #bloodmoney @igorvolsky
you Voted NO on banning high-capacity magazines of over 10 bullets. So shove your prayers where the sun doesn't shine.
This is what you do: http://www.ontheissues.org/Domestic/Lamar_Alexander_Gun_Control.htm …
you voted to repeal the ban on assault weapons.

Dave 1:1. New Dave version (NDV). Machine guns are illegal and have been for almost a century.  Apparently didn't bother shooter.
Are you going to pass common sense gun laws or not?

Prayers are not practical. Voting no on the gun silencer deregulation bill is. Imagine how many more in Vegas would be dead with silencers.
Regulate guns now, or we will reach a tipping point where all guns will be grabbed up and banned for life w/ NRA as a terror organization.
.@SenAlexander took $5,857+ from @NRA to pray about gun violence but do nothing about it.
A soulless man?
Your prayers are sweet. Now get to work and pass some laws to keep us safer, Senator.
What exactly are you praying about?
Stop taking NRA blood money and DO SOMETHING.
This tweet is brought to you by the $5,000+ dollars in “donations” by the NRA.
What solutions do you propose? I'll wait while you contact the NRA for directions.
DO SOMETHING #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Like what?  A madman with an weapon that has been illegal to own since before my dad was born; what is to be done?
You & the other GOP's are in a position to do something by establishing  reasonable gun control laws.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
DO SOMETHING.
Fuck your thoughts and prayers.  How many lives  were saved with thoughts and prayers? Do something about it.
Remember that your voted against an assault weapons ban in 2013.
and how is that working out?
DO
SOMETHING
ABOUT
IT.
Oh shove it, Lamar. Nobody buys your fake concern. Truth is you worship only 2 things: GUNS & MONEY #NRAWhore
Prayers are good and all, but actions are better. Now stop kissing up to the NRA and start those gun restrictions

I'm sure it's easier to offer thoughts and prayers when the nra bought you.
You have taken $29,000 from the NRA. Want to really honor these victims? Give it back. And support responsible gun legislation
#LasVegas
Your thoughts and prayers mean nothing when you continue to take money from the NRA and benefit off of guns. DO SOMETHING.
Your prayers for victims are meaningless & increasingly patronizing unless/until u act consistently. Your deeds for the NRA mock the victims
Prayer is wonderful, but prayer without action is unacceptable. Continue to pray, but please act.
Thanks. Jesus hates people who defend guns. So thanks again.
Send the blood money you receive from the NRA if you men what you say.
Be BOLD and pass some bans. Do a buy back. BE BOLD and protect the people of this nation.
Machine guns are banned.  Do U think that banning them twice will help?

Glad you took thousands of dollars from the NRA to pray. We need gun control that works. This is your fault.

Madman uses an illegal weapon.  What has the NRA got to do with it?
Your prayers are worth less than nothing.
How about donating the $5000+ in blood money you got from @NRA to the victims and their families.
Which has what to do with someone using an illegal machine gun?
Prayers are nice, but we need gun control reform NOW. No one needs an automatic weapon! Stop taking money from the NRA!
And what does that mean?
How many times have you tweeted this meaningless bullshit?
less prayer, more legislation, please
Go to hell
