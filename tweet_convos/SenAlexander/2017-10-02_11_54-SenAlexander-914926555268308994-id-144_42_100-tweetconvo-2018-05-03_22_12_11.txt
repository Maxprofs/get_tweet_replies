#BREAKING Tennessee man killed in Las Vegas shooting, according to wife's Facebook post http://tnne.ws/2yj5lfu 
STOP PRAYING AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT GUN CONTROL!!!!!!
Then do something about it. We need actual gun laws in this country. Because next week it could be anyone of us.
Fucking hypocrite.

No you're not saddened in the least.

Going to the bank this morning to cash that NRA check?
How about show his wife and family that you really mean these words by enacting some common sense gun laws NOW and #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Blood is on your hands for doing nothing to protect the American people from these killing machines. You endangered Sonny Melton's life.
So what will you do about it? Give the @NRA its money back? #GunControlNow
This means nothing until you vote to change laws and ban assault weapons. You are one of the few with the power to change things.
But you will probably still vote to legalize silencers won't you?
I am a registered gun owner in TN. When in HELL are you so-called leaders in D.C. going to wake up and give us some intelligent gun laws?
Clearly your thoughts and prayers don't work. Stop taking NRA money and pass gun control legislation!
Most Tennesseans want sensible gun control laws. Why aren't you listening to us? #eastTNresist
Stop praying, and get behind some legislation to make America safer. Unless you're beholden to the NRA in which case we'll get someone else.
After your prayers, please send the $14,850 you got from the NRA to the GoFundMe acct set up to help with the victim's burial expenses.
If you are saddened, then do your job as a legislator and enact common sense gun reform.
Care to explain why you voted against ban gun sales to terrorists?
I picture you reloading his weapons for him with pockets full of NRA cash.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Didn't you vote against the Assault Weapon ban in 2015?  You are part of the problem Senator.  Blood on your hands.  NRA money in ur pocket
#GunControlNow

My fax to @SenBobCorker and @SenAlexander #GunControlNow 
What do you plan to DO to make sure this never happens again? Please outline your plan for policy change. Prayers mean nothing w/o action
Enough is ENOUGH! Please ban assault rifles at the very least. 9 rounds per second is not necessary for deer and turkey hunting!
So saddened by this that you will #SendBackTheBloodMoney you received from the NRA?

Every Member of Congress Who Took Money From the NRA and Tweeted 'Thoughts and Prayers' to Las Vegas @splinter_news http://ow.ly/9SsB30fAAVY 
Any ideas how to deter things like this from happening?
Hmmm. Maybe not letting people have assault rifles?
It’s a crazy plan - but it might just WORK!
You voted NO 2 denying Guns 4Terrorist Suspects.
How about you take your bloody hands off NRA money and start working 4 your constituents.
If this is not just a tweet to look like a decent person then I hope you will show that and vote against the SHARE act!!
Just a thought @SenAlexander --How about donating the thousands of dollars you've gotten from the @NRA to the Red Cross in their memory?
Your sad ??? Then DO something about about it..Do it for Sonny Melton !!!
Aww. He's saddened.
Surely u plan on donating money u received from the NRA to help pay for the victims funeral expenses and hospital bills
I have a priest whose job is praying. Your job is passing gun control legislation. Do your job! Jesus weeps for your hypocritical prayers.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
You are saddened?  How sad exactly must you get until you change some gun laws... how sad?  How fucking sad do you have to get?
Due something about it. You have the bully pulpit grow a spine and use it.
How dare you sully the memory of those lost with your inaction. #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Having taken money from the @nra you are complicit in his death.
@JSunNews Maybe your NRA money can buy you a new truck. No ethics.
Give the @NRA BACK THE SIX THOUSAND YOU TOOK FROM THEM. #karmaneverforgets
Do more than just think of them. Introduce legislation to prevent this from happening again in his name. Only then you'll have honored him.
It's time to #SendBackTheBloodMoney and stop being complicit in the mass murder of American citizens. The @nra is a terrorist organization
I'm "saddened" you're such a spineless, cheap whore. #GiveBacktheBloodMoney
Your prayers ain't gonna do shit.
Who voted against gun control? Joe and Mika read their names http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/who-voted-against-gun-control … #BloodOnYourHands
Maybe you can set up a memorial fund for his family with your donations from the NRA.

You can take your comment and shove it! Until you are part of the solution, you're part of the problem.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney you contributed to this shooting by taking the NRA’s money and doing NOTHING to work towards stricter gun laws.
To which god are you praying? The one that let him get killed in the first place? The one that didn't simply stop the crazy killer outright?
Now tell us about the campaign money you accepted from the NRA that allowed this to happen.
You took blood money from NRA. Shame.
But I'm sure all the money you get from the NRA doesn't make you sad...
If you truly care, give the @NRA back their blood money and make the madness stop! Platitudes do NOTHING. #SendBackTheBloodMoney
joins you in prayer. Send back the money, vote down the gun silencer bill #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Take action. No more empty thoughts & prayers. You have the ability to introduce gun control and mental health legislation. ACT!
Too bad you've done nothing to actually address these tragedies. Your prayers do nothing, but your inaction speaks volumes.
Put your prayers into action, #SendBackTheBloodMoney & cut ties with the @NRA
Empty Prayers without Action
.@SenAlexander: Stop toeing the NRA line! We need sensible gun laws. Take a stand and #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Praying.  Hmmm, not really as useful or effective as say, passing some sensible gun control laws huh.  Easier of course.
And how much money have you received from the NRA? Worthless condolences! Only the military should have those type of weapons! #guncontrol
Was his life worth the $5857 you took from the NRA?   We need common sense gun laws. #bloodmoney
So, in the future you will be refusing bribe money from the NRA and sending back the money you've already received?

you're not sad. you're happy about the money the NRA gave you. for this the blood of hundreds of people flows
If you're truly saddened by this situation how about you stop taking money from the NRA?
Do something about it.
You sold your soul to the @NRA to stay in power. His death is on you. You murdered him.
It's extremely sad to hear of fellow Tennessean losing his life. But you can do something. You have the power to enact common sense gun laws
He has the power, he asked for the power-and he does not use it.
So how will you protect other Tennesseans from gun violence?
Gonna give up that sweet NRA Ca$h, Senator?
If you're serious, do something meaningful: pass stringent gun control and increase $$ for mental health, for starters. Otherwise, be quiet.
You received $5,857 in expenditures from @NRA & voted down past efforts to limit access to guns. You should #SendBackTheBloodMoney
If I were his wife, I’d curse you up and down this twitter feed. Might take days to get it all out. You bought & paid for NRA POS
enjoy your blood money, Lamar!
Now, ACTION Senator.
But hey...2nd amendment. Right?
@SenAlexander I S   B O U G H T   B Y   N RA !!! What a croock !
when you're done being sad how 'bout doing something about GUN CONTROL...
You've received almost $6k from the NRA and vote against sensible gun control so congratulations, his death is on you.#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Then give the NRA their money back. Or are we not quite THAT saddened?
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
What will you do to prevent another American from dying from an asssult weapon?
If you have rejected every gun control bill, then you are partially responsible for his death. 
#ItIsTheTime
Your thoughts and prayers are meaningless. Do something you useless NRA shill. #SendBackTheBloodMoney
http://youtu.be/3ZQJjeS-l6c  please share. I feel helpless in what’s going on and making these videos help.  #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Saddened to see you voted against prohibiting sales of assault weapons & limiting firearm magazine capacity; you could have prevented this.
As you line your pockets with NRA payola..be quiet Lamar you are complicit..
What about you$5,000+ from NRA you received?I’m from ur hometown& disgusted with U! How abt someGUN-CONTROL Laws&U damn well know we need it
You are an NRA accomplice to mass murder. You have failed your oath to protect us. Shove your useless thoughts & prayers.
I 1:15 Whn u spread out ur hands in prayer I hide my  from u even when u offer many prayers I am not listening ur hands are full of blood!
What are you gonna use to wipe the blood off your hands? Dont think the cash you got from the NRA makes a good hand towel
You took money from the NRA and voted accordingly so over 500 could be shot within minutes. #SendBackTheBloodMoney
http://youtu.be/3ZQJjeS-l6c  please share. I feel helpless in what’s going on and making these videos help.  #SendBackTheBloodMoney
You're bought and paid for by the NRA.  Give back the money and do something to help.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Which means that you'll finally see that saving lives is more important than NRA blood money, right?
#GunControlNOW
Send back your NRA ($5,000+) blood money in addition to praying & feeling "saddened" about YOUR constituent's tragic death.
Are you? Then work towards making real and effective change. Do it for him and all victims. Real gun reform now. We are watching.
Have you considered saving future lives by supporting gun control legislation and telling the NRA you'll #SendBackTheBloodMoney?
Praying is all you can do, Senator, seeing as how you are owned by the NRA. When you take blood money, the blood is on YOUR hands.
I am sure the $5800 helps you sleep better...Sonny's blood is on your hands
how will you make it so this never happens again? Your sadness is meaningless because your votes make these things happen.
Not sad enough to stand up to the NRA though. Sonny’s blood, and the blood of the 450+ injured or killed is on your hands. #guncontrol
But the other 57 dead? not his constituents so... *shrug*
Those prayers really have done a great job curbing all this gun violence. Well done senator 
You are an accessory to mass murder http://www.ontheissues.org/Domestic/Lamar_Alexander_Gun_Control.htm …
What did you do with the almost $6,000 you got from the @NRA?
Then maybe you should stop taking NRA blood money.
Your prayers are no doubt sincere & appreciated, @SenAlexander .  
But when will you be ready to get serious about reducing #GUNviolence ?
Then DO SOMETHING!! Praying isn't doing anything! #guncontrolnow
NRA = $$$$$$$$ right ?!
And by no means take one atom of responsibility for your protection of all Americans to own assault rifles, as the Founding Fathers wanted.
Your constituent helped save his wife's life. Your votes helped to kill him. Congrats and prayers.
DO something to prevent mass killings like this if you actually care!
Stop supporting the NRA you are the killer.
I can only hope you'll support meaningful firearm reform when the time comes. Paul said faith without works is dead, right?
Neat, so tell us more about what you'll do as a policy maker to prevent this from happening again.
