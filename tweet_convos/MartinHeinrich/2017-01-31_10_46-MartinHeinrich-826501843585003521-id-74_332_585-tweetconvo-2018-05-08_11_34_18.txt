Get back to work and get our President a Cabinet! Quit whining and DO YOUR JOB!!!
This Nancy woman obviously wants to live in a fascist state. The rest of us do not.
Asking an elected official to do his job which he was elected by the people to do is fascist?No,democracy
You seem to be so full of venom, and anti-Semitism values that I just don't want to deal with. You need Jesus.
President Trump supporters also believe that Love Trumps Hate--President Trump's supporters are not haters.
So, Can. Trump supporter who just attacked a mosque in Quebec did that out of love. Gotcha. You've be conned.
Wackos are everywhere. What about the violent lib protesters the day of the inauguration? Was that love? No
