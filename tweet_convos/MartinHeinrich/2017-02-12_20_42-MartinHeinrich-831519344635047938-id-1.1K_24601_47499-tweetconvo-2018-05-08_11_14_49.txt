My heart aches. We should be discussing paid leave for families. We are wondering how long we will exist instead. 
.@_tatvamasi is this a real thought??? I'm not a fan of universalized healthcare, but I hope my tax dollars can get you some lithium.
Paid family & medical leave (HRC campaigned on this):
Paid by whom?  You?
I posted a link in my tweet that already answers your question.
Some more resources, in case you are genuinely interested in this topic:
https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-10-22/california-shows-how-paid-leave-law-affects-businesses-not-much …
Since CA already has paid family leave enacted, most studies/articles use data from CA.

can we get a picture of what was going on the night of #Benghazi attack?
We don't have a picture of Yemghazi yet but we know Trump was rage tweeting & Matis was at a black tie dinner. 
and what where Obama & Hillary doing? BTW- It's Benghazi and Trump wasn't POTUS, Mattis has 2t's & it wasn't a video
And it's "were", not "where".
thanks for pointing out that I should hire a proofreader for my tweets & not trust auto correct
@KimSchwan The comparison is laughable. NOW is the time to get involved, make sure you're registered to vote,write your pols, VOTE!
@sharon_leff yep just about sums it up. Selfish vs selfless. #Trumprussia
Cliche but eminently true, this pic is worth 1000 words! Thanks for this, Jon! What a fucking difference an Admin. makes...
remember when they go low you go high TRUMP is strengthening our economy much more than obummer.
make party - not war @jonfavs @PeteSouza
@roxaneschmidt Fine example of the #idiotpresident vs a real leader HC
this is golden 
@21royalstreet yep.  commander in chief. #joke
can that picture of him not giving a fuck please make it to the front of a couple of newspapers please?
@aravosis Obama is a Leader
oh this speaks such ominous volumes.

Ok, that made me laugh. Even with an aching heart. 
that describes you ad a total nut case
He looks like he's tipsy or off in La La land (pun intended) in this pic.
@domich555 : No need to guess who is living in the real world !
@nedprice photo on the left shows actual grown ups experiencing the gravity of situation. Photo on rt?  Moron & minions. #resist
@PeteSouza and the idiot wants us to believe they weren't talking about classified info. No we're just scrambling around 4 fun!!!
@AngryBrown_Girl @thetedsaid @katiebakes @MidWestMet @c_d_ford Comparing a War room pic with some Whitehouse Function ???????? 
Trump was insanely having a war room level meeting in public. Do the smallest bit of research before you post
@AngryBrown_Girl You need to mind it first that I raised #question on Wrong Photo Posting. There's no need of conducting #Research
photo is not wrong. Look it up.
YA where were you when Hillary was selling arms and Uranium, for favors crickets YOU'RE FAKE NEWS
@jackschofield This speaks volumes!

If only there was video contrasting Pres. Obama and Hillary with Trump during the Bin Laden raid
Counterpoint @jonfavs
Counterpoint: Commander in Chief OBAMA  versus Agent ORANGE 
Facing you on the screen the left a the right way to deal with classified intelligence, on the right Trumps way in a restaurant
@3DTruth @SenateDems @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump @realJeffreyLord The difference between  of country & narcissism!
Can someone explain what is happening? Are we comparing similar scenes here? What's the point.
Trump took a North Korea call at that party in public. No context was in this tweet tho.
He doesn't look like he's on the phone/video. Or is it the fact that he is doing business in a party atmosphere?
Yeah, I believe so.
#ComradeTrump was sleeping in his nice warm bed when #RyanOwens gave his life in #YemenRaid epic fail
where were u?
I know the story behind the photo on the left but what is going on in the right photo?
DJT received sensitive info that North Korea launched a missile at a restaurant at Mar A Lago with guests.
We have no way of knowing if info was "sensitive." He was able to share it w/Abe.
Maybe sharing it with  Abe was improper too @Reblawrence12 @MannAtlanta @jonfavs
aides wouldn't have given Prez TS/SCI docs in public setting. Likely generic initial news reports.
Aids to normal president wouldn't, trump is not normal. According to those present, it was a briefing.
"briefing" is a very loosely used word. Trump is not your ordinary President. More difficult to understand, but not impossible.
What is there to understand?  It's been 23 days. Just when you think they have hit bottom, there is an even lower one.
Terrible president on the right, yes, but if I'm not mistaken, in the photo on the left they're watching drone strike footage?
I could be wrong; I remember the photo from an article from years ago, of course.
Take down on Bin Laden on left.
Thanks, just got that from another reply, too.
with this administration things are not beginning to be funny anymore it's scary now
@PeteSouza just the same, right?
Serious stuff on the left & party crowd on the right.  Where is our country heading?
B4 now thought Trump  but not stupid. Now, I gotta say this scene pretty much sums up STUPID! Forget politics, this is a joke!
@PeteSouza Hey Pete, did you take any of these 3 cute shots?
#TrumpPressConference

The Leftist Media has no idea how to handle an alpha male President.…
.@jonfavs
@VerneLaVurl How many wedding guests got droned after that Trump photo?
Yeahhh... Pretty much. #TrumpImpeachmentParty
Classified and secured versus unclassified and unsecured.
yeah, but emails
Obama & Hillary sitting on there rears watching TV, they don't deserve credit - it was 100% US Military....
Hillary's lost emails could have been on that HP laptop in front of her. Some people do use a local PST file as well via Outlook
it looks like Obama and Hillary are appalled by the terrible mistakes they've been making with U.S. foreign relations.
@barbaraJean1980 pics of 2 Situation rooms
@pipeitup55 Tony Blinken looks like he was photoshopped into that first picture #binladenroom

@1moore4theroad @realDonaldTrump is sitting there like a frog on a log, while classified info is being passed around...sad prez!
Hey Pete, is this shot of Barry with Jared Fogle (serving 15 years for child porn) one of yours?
In regards to Kellyanne Conway's "controversy", don't forget that Michelle Obama endorsed and did commercials for Subway in the White House. 
@ahmednasirlaw 
That vapid, insipid, empty smile. Disgusting.
This is treason! Why is he still allowed to disrespect our country? A bunch of spies for Putin!
WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DAY CAN MAKE. DJT is utter MADNESS to the HILT. God save us from this deranged loony-tune of a presidency. SMDH
it's like a F'ing social. The fate of the nation is a f'ing social
house of canards
On the left, a REAL President. On the right, a pretender who's selling us out to Putin.
just a movie set, right? @indivisible9720
the second photo looks more like a party than president things
says it ALL right there Jon! Great tweet!
nailed it...
he's happy because he's the center of attention, period.
Serious faces in the Sit Room with Barry...
Dealing with N. Korea, where is Robin Leach when you need him?
“@jonfavs: ”: So what's the point, who's being dissed and who's pissed?
Psychopath in command 
@brhodes @realDonaldTrump is just a cesspool at its roil. 
Is that Flynn next to Bannon? Thought @PressSec said there was a trust issue with Flynn. Why is he here?
& here I always thght nickname 4 Richard was "Dick", I didn't know it applied 2 Pete 2! Can U post some of BHO golfing?
National security briefing is a party I see. I wonder if they use "football" to snort cocaine off of? :/
just so clueless
Did you see how Obama looked like a scared little kid while America was getting rid of Ben Laden ? A pic says it all :)
secure operations vs dinner party? Which is more professional?
At least @POTUS has camera awareness during serious situations (being sarcastic). Disgusting that this looks like a campaign event.
This picture says so much... he looks like he's thinking "Gee, isn't this great?"
Be afraid of the 
@realdonaldtrump @mikepencevp  Great Pic Pres. wants to be remembered as a king. Demeanor, mega-rich GOP yes men, war on mid clss!
yes, I see how comparing a photo of a relaxed state dinner with a photo of the Sit Room during crisis makes sense. Idiot!
Sometime, you have to let it go!
shame , for your post . stir the pot some more , will that make you happy....
I am befuddled.  White House is Mar-a-Lago?    Security meetings take place on Veranda's #wtf #nationalsecurity #TheApprentice
lol #dumbasstrump thinking of how to rip off more vendors clown, @realDonaldTrump @CharlesMBlow @maddow @JoyAnnReid @funder @msnbc
@jonnysun his face is screaming "I have no idea what's going on but get my good side"
FACTS
wow. That picture says it all panic in the dark.
bravo.
A REAL #potus44 N another playing 1 on TV #PUTINSBITCH
Yep. That's the comparison I just used, too.  Funny how you can play "which 1 of these things doesn't belong" with just 2 images.
this photo is priceless and we are in trouble as a country.
a country at the risk of negating the gains made over many years..
Two different ways how to Handle the sensitive business of the United States
@ShaunKing bernie would've won.
THIS PRESEDENCY BELONGS TO HILLARY! Put the coup de grâce on the coup d'état!!!
@MartinHeinrich thanks for comparison. 45 looks bemused instead of engaged seriously in a crisis. Not secure area. Stupid move.
I'm afraid of the people who are not afraid. This could get so ugly
isn't this how he approved the Yemen raid as well
@MartinHeinrich 
Jon your not saying there is a difference besides hand size are you?
@SenateGOP @SenateGOP @SenateDems DT's actions are a threat to National Security! We r NOT a TV show!
@ElectraGlida Remember your outrage on this ? Tell me again who is the hypocrite here. Deceptive is it ? Time to get real Heather !
@MitchBenn will @FBIMiamiFL announce investigation of reckless exposure of @StateDept &/or @NSAGov documents at golf club dinner?
Are you presenting Fake Twitter News to the American people?
What your getting at ??? one sitting watching his troops executing without trial, One entertain a foreign head of state!
BTW there is only one situation room picture for the former president, could you pls show another one?
Maybe the situation room was too dark to take pictures
when Clinton was selling the Uranium mine
your Tweet was quoted by @washingtonpost
@PeteSouza ,heekkkk @POTUS
America wants to see situation room Sep 11 when Americans were abandoned in Bengazy. Where was the hollywood picture taker?
When Iran got $1.7 billions
funny thing about that is the Obama Hillary photo was a staged event
@ShaunKing Trump is so horrible, we not only miss Obama, we miss Bush!!! Never imagined that would ever be possible. #ImpeachTrump
What does one pic have to do with the other, i.e. Situation Room V celebration dinner.  Don't be stupid.
@ShaunKing EXACTLY!
@ShaunKing A worth a thousand words
@ShaunKing what a contrast.
wish I could love this a million times
the look of a lunatic
Please get a life ! LMAO
You forgot Benghazi pictures, I mean the dead American soldiers
was she watching the election results?
No, that was when they got Bin Laden.
You tend not to smile when it's a very serious situation. And you know the GOP would have grilled them if they were.
I'm sick!
This made me want to punch myself in the face

my twisted attention it seems you neef...
Very grateful for your Pod! Let's appoint Joe Scarbrough as ambassador to Syria! He'll fix it!!
How about this pic of Barry. The liars of Benghazi?  See the blood on their hands?
@PeteSouza the old saying remains.... "I can show you better than I can tell you."  Thank you both.
Glad those morons are out.
@realDonaldTrump  what a Putz
so clueless as to what is happening around him. How are his supporters not alarmed knowing this was during a brief about N. Korea
it's all about the show.
"Can we do this after the cheese?"
have you heard anything on trump getting intel on N Korea  while at his mar largo and openly discussing it at the table
@DeverlyACoston Enough said! #Resist
@RHousewives101 @raebaybayy
That pizza...chilling, huh?

IT'S FINALLY HAPPENING!
#ImpeachTrump #NotMyPresidentTrump #SheWon #PeoplesPresidentHRC #MAGA #RESISTANCE #StrongerTogether #StillWithHer 
@JesseFFerguson the @POTUS44 / @HillaryClinton photo in the war room is one of the greatest photos ever taken. Weight felt...
A crisis is better with palm trees.
The difference in leadership is as plain as black and white err orange. #DumpTrump #LordDampNut
holy hell
Pres Trump's smile is priceless
In this flurry of activity, Trump poses for the camera?
Isn't that the picture where Hillary and co were deciding on what uniforms the troops should wear to Benghazi?
UNBECOMING A PRESIDENT @POTUS TRUMP. PATHETIC!
I think he's humming "Green Acres" theme in his head.
this photo. People at work. Serious at work. You know what this was.
Thank you for the contrast in Leadership.  The photo on the left the moment when Osama Bin Laden was killed, and on right, meh 
@lauraevf1968 we're in some serious fucking danger, aren't we? He's waiting for something bad to happen to use it as gas.
I so hope you're wrong but . . .
Perfect juxtaposition
I could do this all day so stop your bullshit
I love wondering if this asshole is going to kill us all soon.  Oh, and he's not wearing his wedding ring.  Of course.
This is great.
Trump is so cute.
How can anyone complain about Hillary's email and then see crises handled in a dining room? And they were warned about Flynn?
hehehe respect vs laziness
Do you have a pic of the War Room during the Benghazi raid?
@hairmich42  Republicans are such sleaze balls...
We're so worried about Hillary's emails that we'll discuss classified matters in a restaurant!
Yeah, last 3 days have been even crazier than normal-crazy. House of cards falling? I sure as hell hope so...
Trump def. had a bigger crowd! :)
what is he doing there? Being busy with taking photos? Most ridiculous president in world history.
From class to ass!
@brhodes Obama in the corner dressed like someone who fetches your car,Trump in suit and tie.
it just occurred to be "what if DJT has a presidential bucket list?"-in photo he looks like he checked something off his list

But her emails...
the difference is so striking that I feel like I'm so far down the rabbit hole I'll never make it out again!
@Sculptorlady
aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!
FFS. Our GOP reps are such cowardly toads for allowing this. Outrageous.
It would be hilarious if it wasn't so utterly terrifying.
A picture that says it all. Engaged v clueless. Leader v puppet. This is certainly a shameful state for our country.
too sad for words
but the later has waiter service, and Trump Steak and Trump Wine
I see your point, but the picture on the left was totally staged.  At least the picture of Trump is real.
And T is just smiling for the camera...He may have had the mtg there just to get the publicity...
@sterlace_fran sh I wish I could walk into that shot and just slap trump in the face over and over, slap and slap and slap him
me too, so much
he looks like he has stared down into the devil's soul. even his vein is popping out
Looks like he's daydreaming about his Valentine..papa Pooty *sigh*
What difference does it make?
This is what Trump was doing when his botched raid failed in Yemen.
