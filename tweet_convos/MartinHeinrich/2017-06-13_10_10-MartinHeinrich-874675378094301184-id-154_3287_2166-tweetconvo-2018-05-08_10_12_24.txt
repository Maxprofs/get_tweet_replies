This MI Dem thanks you !
No way you idiots Obamacare is your fault. You took my good private insurance and screwed me and 20 million others
These hypocrites exempted themselves grom ACA because it's so great, they won't share in the joy of paying expensive, useless private Ins.
Democrats putting their eggs into Georgia election. Ossoff win will fuel victories in 2018 & 2020. They said the same about Montana & LOST
It's  no worse than what you and Pelosi did one Obamacare.
Karen Handel will not only win in Georgia but will win easily. Dem Polls have not been right in 3 yrs. Their pollsters lie to them
without a doubt!
Reporters are out of control. Propaganda tools.
Damn
Thank you, Senator, for your principled, fierce work on behalf of America. Your questioning during the recent hearings has been brilliant 
Disgraceful Liars
Report the actual news without bias otherwise face the facts, u don't get to cover it.

The GOP are in the pocket of the wealthy. Pure and simple. They can't be trusted.
We Oppose #TrumpCare. This is an official stance from ABQ INDIVISIBLE! #HealthCareForAll #healthcare4NM
I don't know how many marches are happening tomorrow, but TorC walks for #HealthCare4NM Day of Action. I hope many NM towns will #Healthcare
The GOP should all be investigated for ties to RUSSIA  they sure don't have the AMERICAN PEOPLE  in mind.
This is NOT a Repub attack. Tell the truth. Nothing has changed. Why do you continually lie & play the fake blame game?Dems lost my vote
Fake news has to go
The secrecy was with your LAST President who had the media lying.  Obamacare, HRC emails, Humedin, Benghazi...What a joke! #MAGA
...and what will be the ultimate result of Obamacare if left alone?  It's dying and Congress wants to continue this Kabuki theatre.
The @gop is blatantly corrupt...and they seem rather proud of it. #fuckthegop #impeach #resist
GOP (Our Govt) think they're untouchable but the power to change all that is ours
How
Great Question? Appealing to GOP Via Calls, Emails, Tweets Doesn't Work - In It For Themselves They Are, Seems We Must Occupy Offices/Homes
How can a party always be in 100% agreement with every idea put forth, rarely a dissenting vote
I ask you how can a party alway be 100% against every policy put forth ?? Washington is corrupt  period. Obama and hilary were the worst.
#LotaltyLube
Bless your heart, rememberObamacare?

Cowards!  We are being raped!!!!
I would prefer that the Dems. Obama Care just implode and let the Dems own it.
It's not a heathcare bill- it's a "couldn't care less" about health bill #Trumpcare
If they were proud of the #TrumpCare bill, they wouldn't back door us on it. We ALL must be heard!#SAVETHEACA!
#WeThePeople #RESIST #DealsInTheDark  #DEMANDTransparency on #HEALTHCARE #ACA #OBAMACARE
You were great today!
What number should we call?  Give me a mother effing republican to call.  I'll borrow a zip code.
Marty Obamacare is through. Hospitals and Doctors don't accept it High premiums, extremely high deductibles. You are a money raising machine
Oh Marty, You fool.... You have ALL of the media, 93% backing the Liberal agenda  and bashing @realDonaldTrump 24/7.  Relax Man....
We need to do everything  to shut down TRUMP CARE
Watched you today, it was great!! I appreciate the fact that you stayed consistent with the democrats, behavior, which is being an ASSHOLE!!
Yes they are. And you are watching it happen. Please withhold unanimous consent to slow down Senate business so that we can stop this thing
Nice job today Martin!  I voted for you and will be voting for you again.  Keep up the good work; it is appreciated...
ignore them when they need you for campaign and publicity
Heinrich, you're an embarrassment to this country. Your "tough guy" stance at the hearings is insipid. At depo I'd eat "you" for lunch.
Bring in the press as your guests! Hold ur own hearing!
Blah blah blah
Put your big boy drawers on...and accept responsibility for #Obamacare which was and is a trainwreck.

When do they issue the Stormtrooper uniforms with a Trump Death Head on it? @USAGSessions @realDonaldTrump
#BaaBaaBlackSheepTrump

And for the record...Martin Heinrich was the HERO of the day!!!!! The only man in the room with Balls!

#HushHushJeffSessions
Republicans are enabling the Wanabe Dictator!!
Didn't @NancyPelosi say you vote for it to find out what's in it. Funny how you forget that. #snowflake #Hypocrite
Reepers .... Can't live with them.. wanna live without...
I think it's a fantastic idea…promote whoever came up with this!!
Wannabe tough guy.... LOL .. punk !
I'm proud that they have the balls to take the Dem crimals on. If you hate Americans so much why not move. We hate paying taxes for you!
Just like Obamacare! We have to pass to know whats in it! Then Speaker Peolis!  You  that i see? Starting lying and grow up
Very proud of how you handled your questioning of Gen Sessions. Really sad state of affairs.
Let them screw it up then they own it, next step single payer healthcare
Stop lying
HYPOCRITES what is wrong you don't like what you did to them being done to U? Demonic rats didnot let ppl know what was in bill until voted.
lol r u saying the reporter r so stupid the only place they can interview is in the halls. Maybe ur 1% MEdia friends need to work harder
You are choosing to be clueless. The R's didn't oppose reporters. They opposed the fabricators of false destructive news! CNN!
not only are they trying, they're succeeding. What are we to do?
who do I call. ?  Write. Email.
Halls of congress getting more like the Kremlin each day.

Places reporters are not allowed to go...

the Kremlin and the @GOP controlled U.S. Capitol Building in Washington DC. 
Repubs just trying to achieve their dirty deeds without anyone asking them why they chose to stiff the majority of Americans.
Secrets in DC a waste of time bc the whole nation is going to know how bad the bill is and how much these guys are trying to screw us.
Walk your fanny down to Schumer's office and thank him for that precedence: reconciliation!
Republicans should keep Fake News out of the loop to stop the leftist propaganda. Schumer is an obstructionist with no regard for the people
Senator, which country do you think would be the best for us to flee to when @TheDemocrats and @POTUS allow a total Trump & @GOP coups?
Canada or France?
France is too Commie Socialist for me. Canada is great, but like Austria & Germany, too close for comfort.
Democrats are so afraid of #AHCA. But Why?
Standing with u. Going get them  this has to stop.
Keep making noise, expose the secrecy! Name theSenators. Who do they represent Take a, #WhatsInItForThePeople message to the public square.
Communism in the Republican senate with their ties to Russians no doubt just call them what they are communist
Tell Chuck how much you love his hairplugs.
Dems...let's step it up. Do not remain silent...PLEASE! 
Damn can't remember you doing this when Obamacrud was Have to pass it if you want to see what's in it,
No actually they want to stop the "FAKE" news and have America receive the correct information Something u & the dem party do not want
You guys need to pass the bill so we can find out what's in it.
@Hardeyaddra how about the dems who created the health care mess? Why do they refuse to help? What about the ppl?
How about the people in Ohio who just lost their O-BUM-a care carriers? Even the Insurance Companies no it's dying. Congress won't admit it
the dems had a disastrous plan & i feel had planned for failure  to create single payer. Sucks
And about Trump/Russia.
Then what r u doing about it? Where is the outrage against what the Repugs are doing? Why isn't there pandemonium in the hallways? Stampede?
The call for civil disobedience is getting very LOUD.
#WithholdConsent
Please be a strong voice for us up there!
Thank you, Senator.
When will you organize a massive sit-in on the halls of the Capitol? Drastic measures require drastic means
Senator, what are the Dems doing to procedurally stop/slow down the health care legislation? You MUST do all you can!
What do the R's think this is, Russia? We have free press to tell us about their secret 'health bill'. If it's a good thing, why hide it?
Bc liberals bash it b4 even reading it, like @NancyPelosi did.
How could the Democrats read it if the GOP hasn't let them see it? This is America not Russia. Freedom of the Press!
When the bill is ready out of the Senate then will see. But is not an approved bill as Senate got rid of House bill
No, won't retweet. Politicians deserve 2 fight back against lying liberal reporters. If u cant be fair & balanced, then "no soup 4 u!"
President Trump tweets too much Democrat crying
President Trump tweets too much liberal crying,
but Democrats will tweet as much as they can
Live look at the Senate GOP
@SenSchumer how is this legal?  Can't it be ignored???
Poor babies. Maybe its to give Senators privacy the press is so rudely have been denying. Pounce and lie. That is what the press does!
At least R's in Congress are not physically assaulting reporters.
Just like "Fake News" your ability to help Americans is clouded by your partition attitude. 
Keep it up, you'll pay for it the end.
Stop
Retweeting the retweet. You guys tweet more than president Trump
Please share with anyone claiming that similar “secretive” tactics were used with the ACA: https://www.c-span.org/video/?292260-1/white-house-health-care-summit-part-1 …
Do your job and represent all Americans. Pass this bill.
I wish you could see the look on my face when an Obamacare supporter calls anything "disastrous " in regard to a new healthcare bill.
I don't know what to do
They are not answering their phones either!!
The GOP are becoming so shady and so Russian! Dems better get this under control!
Ring Mike Mastrian's phone off the hook until they give up who ordered it. https://www.radiotv.senate.gov/staff-2/  202-224-6421
#the decision...was made unilaterally by Senate Rules Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.)"
I oppose #FakeNews!
By fake news do you mean reporters getting information from public officials and then writing about it?
If you mean reporters twisting the truth then yeah they should be expelled from the White House
First of all, this is about reporters seeking access to members of congress, not the White House press
Which is why it's a good idea to go to a variety of media outlets to get a range, and hopefully balanced, view of the news
That can't happen, however, of all reports cannot access the very people who are making the news happen
That's why this development should be upsetting to everyone, regardless of your personal political outlook
