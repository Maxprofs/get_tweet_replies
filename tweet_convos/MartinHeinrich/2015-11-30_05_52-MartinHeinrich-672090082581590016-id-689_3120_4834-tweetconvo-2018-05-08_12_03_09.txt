@BillGates @richardbranson I hoped to see nuclear energy (fission or fusion) feature as prominently as solar and wind.
@DarenHeidgerken @BillGates @richardbranson great idea, giving nuclear to Somalia, Libya, Syria, etc. love it.
@Solar_Shack @BillGates @richardbranson Fusion tech will be quite safe whenever someone can get it to work.
@Solar_Shack @BillGates @richardbranson Also, 1st world could benefit from more/better nuclear power plants now.
. @DarenHeidgerken @doyleclan1 @Solar_Shack @BillGates @richardbranson You would put nuclear within grasp of people who would use it 4 evil?
@SkiPoss @DarenHeidgerken @Solar_Shack @BillGates @richardbranson Realistically, these kill instantly.
Baseload must increase & we must çhoose
@L4serTX3 @SkiPoss @DarenHeidgerken @Solar_Shack @BillGates @richardbranson
@BillGates Wouldn't it be better to just put up a billion solar panels?
@benfraley @BillGates No. Do you have any idea how much materials and land that would destroy for very little energy return.
@FriendsOScience @BillGates yes http://www.techinsider.io/map-shows-solar-panels-to-power-the-earth-2015-9 …
@benfraley @BillGates Practically spkg U forget transmission/distribution/interties. Solar is THE most expensive+ only 1/2 day if lucky.
@BillGates why do you think of poverty your the richest man in the world i dont think you care about poverty

@BillGates  Billy u are always doing good to help make a better world, but can  humans replace the materials they take from the earth daily.

@BillGates rich people seem to forget the needy of this nation are fighting for survival, the climate is the least of their worries.
@BillGates what about the homeless, jobless, people who cannot afford food etc. the climate is little concern. if we have a planet left

@BillGates glad to see cheap energy instead of raising pay let's go for making things  cheaper
@BillGates 
@BillGates go for it, Bill
@BillGates Of course we need clean energy but could u spend 1% of that to fight elephants poachers? Tomorrow will be too late...
@BillGates# we are hopeful for ur innovations
@BillGates Sir Rain water is cheap clean energy. All that is needed is to store it properly and distribute. Storing needs to be planned.
@BillGates There is absolutely no credible evidence to support this.
It's about taxing the sheep! How can you support this nonsense??+
@BillGates climate change and global warming is a hoax Bill
@BillGates Sir, specifically invest in Solar energy to save earth. Eminent persons like you can save earth by your thoughts put into action
