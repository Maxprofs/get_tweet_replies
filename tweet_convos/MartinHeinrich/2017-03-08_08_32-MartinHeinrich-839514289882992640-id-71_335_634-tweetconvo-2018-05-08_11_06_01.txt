Get on the committee to give constructive input & feedback instead of being a roadblock. 
@agirlasleep when trying to explain they just say how bad Obamacare was, if a new car dealer did that to me I'd run,
can you tell me how increased amts in HSAs makes health care more affordable? Tax credits. Who can afford to put $ into HSA?
@SenateDems they must be stopped for Americans whether they are wise enough to know it!!
@SenateDems right there is no cbo or any other math that shows the true cost to all esp seniors disabled and liq income.
@SpeakerRyan why ram it through- when will public get to provide input- shouldn't we know costs #Trumpcare
what shall we do
you can read it after you pass it
much the way the Dems did Obama care and I lost my plan and my premium doubled and the plan is awful.  Thanks for reminder
It's not "TrumpCare".  It's GOPDONTCARE.
it is crazy! Republicans have perpetuated a lie for 6 yrs. They had a better health plan. They ran on that lie. Oops!
We must Pass the bill to see what's in it. Per Nancy Pelosi. @MartinHeinrich
No, this bill will not not help the people it needs to help. See Congressional Budget. See bill itself.
Sorry,  I was told we must Pass it first. Nancy Pelosi. 
 @MartinHeinrich
who cares what Nancy wants?! This bill is horrible. Final. Truth.
You have always cared what she thinks.  Don't lie. 
Obummer care is bad for America.  And you love it.  
 @MartinHeinrich
You do not know me. Obama care is not perfect but better than we had before. More folks have been insured.
Very affordable premium. Not anymore. 
It was $35. Every two weeks.  Not now. @MartinHeinrich
This is unexceptable. The American people deserve nothing but the best possible health care plan possible. Work together.
Really?! You're so outraged? Obamacare passed before anyone even read it.  Don't be a hypocrite.
#Trumpcare is a disaster. SAD!
At least we won't be FORCED to buy it. That's all I care about. And all I need to know.
please call it #Republicare He doesn't need his name on anything else, and @SpeakerRyan doesn't need someone to blame later.
Everything and everyone.
@TallyAnnaE yes of course they can care less, their stupid agenda is to repeal and replace, why are we surprise
@SenateDems exactly, it is total reckless! @SpeakerRyan how can anyone,@GOP support this move. This national budget disaster
you're not surprised are you?
didn't Nancy say we had to pass ACA to see what was in it? Just saying
@SenateDems No CBO score = blind voting = good for them. #crookedGOP #TrumpCare
@SenateDems simple solution: vote no
It is outrageous that Dems passed Obamacare in the first place. I'm paying $1,385 per month. REPEAL OBAMACARE NOW!!
upset! Always have access to what i own! Forbidden practices. Arrest all. Rents only.©™®
@SenateDems I mean, but it IS the worlds greatest healthcare plan. It says so right in the name. WHAT COULD GO WRONG?
@SenateDems if people knew the cost there would be complete warfare from the American public.
@Marina_Sirtis So many people will loose coverage and the cost to the debt will skyrocket. Only helps lobbyists.
@SenateDems Gotta keep their promises to the American people, regardless of who will die from it. What a circus! 
You mean like how Obamacare was advanced overnight and jammed through Congress w/o any discourse?
"jammed" is a false narrative by GOP. Took over a year for bill to pass
SINGLE PAYER .
@Marina_Sirtis really what I'm saying is are you surprised?
@SenateDems the GOP does not care about the general population just themselves!
@Marina_Sirtis is it really outrageous that they are trying to replace as fast as possible despite the obvious problems
@SenateDems How does Trumpcare address the reduction and elimination of the donut hole for Medicare from the ACA?
@SenateDems 

Aka:  "GOP norm"

@IndivisibleSDNo
@SenateDems Almost or is it a Crime against Humanity in the slow death category??
they don't care. Theyre so blinded by partisanship they just want Obamacare to go away regardless of consequence
@SenateDems This bill gives a huge tax cut to the wealthy and business.. that's all the numbers they need!
Agreed, sir-almost as outrageous as then-Speaker Pelosi's "We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it"
@SenateDems when 60 million gain coverage will you take bowl water and towel and go wash the president feet?
@SenateDems @GOP is more concerned w/ how much money it will make. You can't run a party on ideals and policies alone.
Really like what u people did .UR pathetic that u did dame thing and now ur mad.it's ur fault ACA sucks
@SenateDems Don't want CBO estimates that show increase in deficits. Too hard to explain to mouth breathers.
@Marina_Sirtis they don't want that "bloodbath" that 45 promised them if they didn't pass it.
HELLO? You said it. Party claims to be all about saving money, doesn't want to know. What does that say?
its not called #Trumpcare its called #RepublicansDontCare
@SenateDems how does giving more money to CEO n Corp help ppl get HC
Not just outrageous but dangerous as well.
@SenateDems  and @TheDemocrats  sit and do nothing.but complain #wethepeople #draintheswamp #justiceforall  @POTUS
We know how it would impact George and his wife: It would devastate them.
Wait, didn't you just tweet that GOP was advancing  bill before knowing the costs or who will lose care?  How do you know?
Hmmm.....I remember @NancyPelosi saying pass #Obamacare to see what's in it.  Doesn't feel good being on that side does it?
Thank you @MartinHeinrich for being a voice for the average American
Exactly. Please fight this GOP replacement.
Republicans are NOT the party of the working class. They look down on the poor. They are the party of wealthy white folks.
Stop them! Shame them.
their health care bill is terrible! Even AARP says it will hurt the very people it should help. The wealthy will not suffer
You realize the Senator makes more money than most of us here?  He IS the wealthy.
Ha ha, we must Pass the bill to see what's in it.  Nancy Pelosi!
Your party. Sorry Charlie.
Yep and just like this one we want now what is in it until all the amendments have been accepted or rejected.
As I recall, during the Ocare debates it took nine months to get it to the floor and the Republicans said it moved too fast.
And some of the controv is abt rushing it through w/o CBO score. This is slapdash work & the right knows it.
