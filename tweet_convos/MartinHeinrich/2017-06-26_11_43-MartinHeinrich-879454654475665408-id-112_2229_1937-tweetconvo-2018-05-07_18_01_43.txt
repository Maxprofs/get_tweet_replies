Great! Then @AmerMedicalAssn is coming out strong against abortion!  Stop killing babies!
Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy, not "killing babies," but your appeal to emotion is noted.

Clearly you don't teach biology.
Giving birth might also be called "termination of a pregnancy". Only difference is you have a living human with the latter.
Your statement doesn't contradict my position, or the actual definition of abortion, whatsoever.
What is your position?
Read the thread.

His position is that human life is arbitrarily determined to not exist before the moment of birth.
Wha'? Then what is growing inside a woman's uterus? The contention that a human child is not in the woman is beyond "arbitrary" unto foolish
@marcorubio @tedcruz @SpeakerRyan SHAME ON YOU ALL.
Plz remember this whn #chronicpain pts require #opiate therapy in order to have quality of life. #OpiatesSaveLives #DependenceIsNotAddiction
@BillCassidy you listening? I heard you were a doctor but have yet to see you act like one.
Oh, look, an organization that restricts the supply of medical care citing the Hippocratic Oath.
Please!  The AMA has been harming patients by restricting supply for over 100 years!

"What is better for mankind and society, abundance or scarcity?"

The AMA prefers the latter, b/c it's better for their medical cartel.
ASAM stands with the AMA and others in opposition of this bill, as it would decimate access to addiction treatment services. #HealthcareBill
I really don't understand how there is still a good chunk of Americans who don't GAF. Addiction can happen to anyone. Anyone.
Noone cares what you oppose because you represent big pharma, NOT doctors. This is why 77% of docs disagree with you
Maybe you shouldn't have endorsed Tom Price then.
What about the Physicians that Serve and Vote in Congress... #FirstDoNoHarm
So will the ama now stop opposing single payer? Ball is in your court!
AMA also opposes #harmless #vaping, thus the #Senate #healthcarebill is likely a great deal for The Public & must be approved at all cost
I, an immigrant @ age 8, food-stamp-Medicaid-federal-student-loan&grant-recipient NOW physician, will continue to uphold #firstdonoharm
You go, girl!
Thank you AMA. DROP BIG BUCKS TO DEFEAT. #MAGA #Trumpcare #HEALTH
@SenatorTimScott did you know the AMA opposes the Senate Healthcare bill?
The American Medical Association knows more about health and health care than Republicans!
Both @TheDemocrats @GOP work 4corporations like insurance companies, where do u think reelection $ comes from? Corporate lawyers write bills
What is your point exactly?
My point is if u think either party is working 4 u they aren't.
I choose to stay and play.

Statement by MD chief execs of Permanente Medical Groups representing 21,000+ physicians @KPshare on #HealthCareBill https://permanente.org/permanente-medical-groups-release-statement-on-health-care-bill/ … 
Thank you @AmerMedicalAssn! #HealthcareBill
Few know that AMA when Medicare was created were given exclusive rights to create billing codes for entire H/C system & get % for each bill
I will retweet this every time it comes across my feed
Maybe too late ALL 1 Mil MDs are miseducated to use MRIs Drugs Saws to fraulant helping heal Muscle microInjury pain cured w Massage Stretch
check out the misinformation being spread by the VP
the AMA is Correct to oppose Trump Care @SenDeanHeller @SenCapito agree lawsuit against Trump Care @DavidColeACLU

Meanwhile Trump and @gop are still trying to get the USA to drink the #putinesque #trumpcare poison Kool Aid. 
Proud of my @AmerMedicalAssn for taking this stand. Pretty remarkable given the history of the AMA and health insurance reform in America.
They still have to make a lot more changes to be my AMA.
July 12 is last day to submit comments online to HHS about planned repeal of ACA. RT! Please comment! https://www.regulations.gov/comment?D=CMS-2017-0078-0001 …
tom price thought it was the hypocritic oath he needed to take
Fraud Knee replacements for True Muscle Micro Injury #ChronicPain healed by Massage is ungodly dehumanizing Theft of living tissues.
AWESOME!!!!
Dem Senators gather during July recess.Tell USA how @DNC along with #AMA will fix #ACA. 8 point Plan. Dems: Be Part of Solution Revolution.
Can someone point me to the language in the proposed legislation that supports your assertion?
Claiming to #FirstDoNoHarm w/o aggressively dealing with docs role in #opioidcrisis is hypocritical, not Hippocratic
@SenSasse, @DebFischerNE: AMA harshly criticizes BCRA for its harm. How can you intellectually & morally justify a YES vote, knowing that?
#SaveACA
Nursing student here! Thanks for standing up to the Senate! Affordable healthcare is a right.
Thank you!
You realize that the GOP bill has the same kind of mandate?  They added it today.
 #Proof the New Bill has NOTHING to do with providing #Healthcare4Americans. Instead, this Bill is a Transfer of Wealth for #TheRich.
@GOP are RUTHLESS HEARTLESS BASTARDS WITHOUT AN OUNCE OF COMPASSION!
They have committed TREASON sondirectly killing US just their next step
But then why the hell is @AMPAConline donating to political campaigns for Repub MOCs who made ACA repeal cornerstone of their campaign???
How can one log an ethics complaint regarding @SecPriceMD attempt to knowingly harm 22mm patients? #askingforafriend
#Hypocrites.
Eat your words. 

You, the @LungAssociation and many others.

#FirstDoNoHarm:
@danpfeiffer be sure to note that AMA physicians don't want their income cut! BS business model will fail
#SenateGOP confused Hippocrates with Hypocrites. There's no "care" in their #HealthcareBill #BCRA = #BCRAP
Do no harm means do no harm to doctors too. Fight the MOC! Fight the over regulation and bad treatment of docs! Make the AMA do no harm!
@KellyannePolls said "let's not call them cuts" #AlternativeFacts or Lets separate wheat from chaff. Trump doesn't like "poor people" SICK!
Somehow the Senate Republicans see the poor, ill and most of the middle class as sub-human. Not deserving the same considerations.
It just occurred to me. Every pharma ad tells us to ask "your doctor if drug is right for you." Go ahead ask your doc if the bill is good 4u
@BenSasse  @SenatorFischer Please Do not vote for this bill !!!   It would be devastating to so many people !
Thank you! #DoNoHarm #InsureMoreNotLess
... U liars pushed Obamacare so you could sell more ICD and CPT data.  Now you claim "do no harm?" #hypocrites What about taxpayer harm?
Exploding ICD-10 data requirements created billions in administrative costs for Doctors but put million$$$$$ in your pocket$.
+1 (202) 224-3121 Call the Senate Hot Line Now. STAND UP FOR THE USA. # DoNOHARM
Senate Hot Line Call Your Senator +1 (202) 224-3121 STAND UP!!!!!!

Thank you
Are doctors committing #abortions? #FirstDoNoHarm part of the hypocrisy oath? @AmerMedicalAssn
The OMA stands with @AmerMedicalAssn in opposition to the proposed bill. Here is the OMA's statement. http://www.theoma.org/news/federalbill_June2017 …
A request to @SenBobCorker @senrobportman : stand with patients and providers. Oppose #BRCA. #DontCapMyCare #MedicaidWorks #KeepKidsCovered
The GOP should really be ashamed.....talk about A SICKNESS! So sad.....Thankyou for this tweet AMA
@lisamurkowski !
James Madara wrong. Act helps stop tax payers from being taken advantage of, gives states more control, gives patients more responsibility.
When I wrote about my daughter's physician waving bills in her face, AMA had nothing to say. First do no harm did not matter to you.
Pure garbage. There is no harm. Health care is available. It's up to each citizen to make their decision. Check out how it worked in USSR.
Proud to be a member today
@SenBobCorker Please vote NO.
This is an oath you took, @RepAndyHarrisMD remember that.
Forcing people to by a product is first and foremost a harm.
The AMA leaders and political lobby should be arrested and put in prison for price fixing and restraint of trade practices.  #RIGGED
Is artificially suppressing the supply of seats in medical schools how you "do no harm"?   #AntiTrust  #Cartel  #RIGGED
You love that status quo, don't you AMA?   Don't change a system that you benefit from.  "Do no harm?" PFFFFT!
Whoops
.@SenToddYoung  The AMA opposes BCRA because IT WILL HARM millions of Americans. Vote no on BCRA! Please do no harm!
Your other vow "Gouge sick people while getting rich on their suffering."
Thank you for your statement.
I see @JohnCornyn already follows the AMA on Twitter, but just in case he missed this tweet I'm tagging him for his convenience.
Yes just like you have followed that with regards to vaccines   My son was injured with the MMR you F'n hypocrite's power hungry Aholes
Actually it is. The FDA and FTC control everything related. It's not about healthcare it's all about the $$$. They don't learn how to "cure"
nor do they want a cure. Pharmaceutical companies sponsor Medical Institutions. They want you on drugs for the rest of your life.
@JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain @dougducey Vote No on republican healthcare bill
@SenToomey If something was so good, why would the AMA oppose it?  #AnyoneButToomey2022
Loss of $$$$.
DR. @BillCassidy - check your twitter account. FIRST DO NO HARM. You took an oath sir - not the oath of office. #ProtectOurCare
@SpeakerRyan Do you see this?  #DeathCare #WealthCare
#fuckoffanddiecare
Thank you for speaking out
I love how the association making the most money off of Obamacare is promoting its longevity.. and people actually believe it.
You also supported disastrous #Obamacare. Can't be trusted.
Nice attempt as prose, but paranoid nonsense otherwise.
Come on @ASHPOfficial ... our oath also says Do no harm! Speak out against this terrible bill that will hurt millions of patients
Come on @pharmacists.. our oath also says Do no harm! Speak out against this terrible bill that will hurt millions of patients
Why can't you write prescriptions for patients?  Are you too incompetent to handle that responsibility?  Must be.
