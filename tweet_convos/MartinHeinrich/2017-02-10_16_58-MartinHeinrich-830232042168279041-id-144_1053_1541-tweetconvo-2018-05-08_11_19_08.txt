How do you know that's the key to classified info? Anybody could take a photo of a key and write a headline. Go find some real news
It's right in the damn photo. On. His. Desk.
Yo John! Where does it say "highly classified material" on that bag?
Anybody with minimal knowledge of classified info knows that's a classified info bag.
Clearly you're assuming and trying to sound like you know. Not working. You know nothing.
Clearly you missed the "Dip Brat" on my profile. Move along.
@Honey17011 Once again u can't make thisup !#wtf
hello!  Clinton did far worse with her private email scandal.  How soon you forget.
you're exactly right
we would get fired for this immediately. This is clear violation of the clean desk policy that any company with classified info has
No kidding!!
why I
Revoke his security clearance!
if it were HRC it would have been "lock her up"
@KateMiller57
@MartinHeinrich Except the part that that is not classified info and Krzanich already has a security clearance. Good job checking.
@MartinHeinrich Unforgivable. Unfathomable. In most C-Suites, NO documents are visible on the desktop when meetings are held.
President Alfred E. Newman.
@MartinHeinrich You know that is Trump's personal mail they deliver daily from NY right. Classified documents always have a handler
@CoryBooker he who has not sinned throw the first stone. You Sen. Booker?
@CoryBooker it is only a matter of time till he does something blatantly and undeniably illegal and/or dangerous
happening in front of our eyes but they have lock on power. Rs have no soul to leave unaddressed
The *one thing* even liberals agreed Trump had great command of was his image and stagecraft. Not so much.
Not necessary his"command"of actual image..fluid sans principles-but his complete & utter devotion2"control"of media
I feel America is in jeopardy with this reality tv star as president. The impeachment can't come soon enough.
Can we deport him back to TV Land? Or to the set of The Truman Show?
@CoryBooker Yes! What about safety trump? Protect America.
SMFH
A classic design of stupid!
the point is not that anyone W/out clearance got into it..It's HE LEFT THE FRIGGIN KEY IN IT WHILE WITH NON CLEARANCE THERE.
Please, like he has a clue. The man needs a babysitter.
I guess Benghazi and continuous leaks from Democrats and liberal election fraud do not matter cuz u lie.
Endless GOP investigations report zero from Libya. Bush DoJ found no fraud.
@CoryBooker. Oh my. I see a key. Your a laughing stock
It's where he keeps his stash of Skittles.
@CoryBooker isn't this worse than emails on a secured server?  A server that the Russians weren't able to hack btw!
you mean the email server in trumps tower tied to  Russia ? And the RUSSIAN BANK ?
the key is not classified-so no issue. If you are trained to handle classified material you would realize ''tis is not an issue.
And aren't they using unsecured phones as well to hide from the public their communications?????
Serously a Key,,how about #650kGovernmentE-mails on a private server..Can we say WHAT.
@MartinHeinrich . That's not the key for the nuke key dumbies.
.That's Optus laptop. In the dam white house guarded . WTF Dems GTFU
why do the Muslims want to come here they can not get along with them selves in their own country
and we gave this guy the nuke keys and codes! OK fuck the wall build us bomb shelters like "YA!"
and what is this picture doing on twitter? Have you all lost your brains?
At least it hasn't killed anybody...you know...like four Americans!
Lock him up
@marcylauren Among other things, Trump is careless,thoughtless,has memory issues.This story would be covered 24/7 if Obama had done
Oh..but her emails...
Those binders are full of old "The Apprentice" scripts.
Uh, Trump is using a private email server now.
@cnn WTF?
hillary could teach this class on classified info
@CoryBooker he will learn, good catch you should have told Trumo not the world.
@CoryBooker you poeple looking for anything to bitch about, if your not gonna help fight the cause that he won on then shut up
Then's there's the irony of meeting with Intel a tech company with his messy desk loaded with papers but no computer
I call B.S.!  Where were you the past 8 under the CIA/NWO plant? Ask HRC about classified anything...
Trump is a danger to America.
@MartinHeinrich would anyone have noticed the key if the Senator mentioned it? Probably not
Remember when Heinrich warned Hillary Clinton about an unsecured server?  Yeah, me neither.
@hocwatch is this all they have?
But never call Obama for abandoning Americans in Benghazi
We have dangerous people in the WH. HELP!
, As if he cared!
@CoryBooker fake news
@CoryBooker POTUS just said he "likes to surprise us," but it is no surprise.  The art of dodgeball and self inflicted wounds-da...
... You've got to be f%&king kidding me.
@CoryBooker looks like he is not doing much about paperwork either. Where's Steve, Paul, Mitch, Pence? Somebody, anybody!
So...if this seems like it's just petty nonsense from the left...that's cuz it is.
@CoryBooker hey it's better than letting 100,000 emails get hacked eh? Hahahahhahaha
a wall won't stop stupidity, arrogance, and ignorance. perfect example of utter incompetence, recklessness. Horrible!
@CoryBooker  But...the email server.  
@CoryBooker, this shows how badly this WH is being run #impeachTrump
that is classified info just sitting out in the open. I can see the red stripe of a classified document in the stack.
This is hilarious.The classic pot calling the kettle black.Your stupid POTUS nom is the poster child 4 #classified101
Oval office = random place of business
@CoryBooker Fake news
@MartinHeinrich Terrible! Time to say bye bye!
@CoryBooker What a Clown! Working with the Russians, hanging up on the Aussies. We are the comedy central of world politics.
In the pantheon of stupid/evil/demented shit he's done, this doesn't move the needle. Certainly not worth making any political hay.
While he's sitting right there next to it. In the Oval Office. At White House. The most secure place in America. Yup. Careless.
Oh no, can't be negligent, no...not the Don! /s #FuckUpNChief
we got it, it's alright.
@CoryBooker you sorta have to lol otherwise it's just too sad and scary
deliberate. Hilary accused of not knowing how to protect classified, this is what President does. Investigate and prosecute.
This guy is so stupid, why did he take this job.
a bag with a key beside him in his office is bad? it doesn't say classified. The Hill=fake news!!! This report is stupid
@CoryBooker What an embarrassment this administration is? Might as well just put the key in a fake rock on the lawn
@CoryBooker fool @realDonaldTrump
@CoryBooker of course a damn black ass senator retweet this.hes a disgrace to America citizens
No "lock him up" chants? Not even for the botched Yemen raid? What if he used private email servers for classified info? Oh wait…
Oh right, it was the last guys fault, clearly… it's not like the new guy can't pay attention to or understand briefings…
@CoryBooker Prob is he is so clueless he doesn't get it.  It's the one with C on it.  Bashes Hillary and hypocrite does it
@CoryBooker Holy crap!  Talk about ethics violations!!
@CoryBooker He's doing the best he can....Oh boy we are in trouble
@CoryBooker oops
Another example that America has an amateur butt head for a President.
@CoryBooker Messiest presidential desk I've ever seen!  
@MartinHeinrich shouldn't there be an FBI investigation into his mishandling of classified documents?
@MartinHeinrich Fire Trump!
Like, how did he call him out?
If he were in the military, he'd be courts-martialed and quite possibly receive a general discharge-or worse.
Maybe Trump could put it next to Hillary's private server next time.
FAKE NEWS
Hey @speakerryan @nancypelosi we're still waiting for an Art2:Sec4 draft - you're got plenty of evidence
@MartinHeinrich 
Oh no!
@thehill
Correct good catch 45 should never trust a democrat around anything classified its shows how low they stoop!
hey kiss ass GOP you feel real safe ?
God help us all. #unqualified #impeachtrump #resist #putinspuppet #bannonsbigboy
if there was a Democrat smart enough to call out the president on anything a Democrat would be president.
did you check to see if his pants with ziped.
and no comment about hillary being hacked world wide on her private server?
LoL. The office is starting to look messy.
Does that list of who shouldn't have it include the Orange one himself? Like he reads the reports!  Or can.
@realDonaldTrump must be impeached or removed via Amendment 25.
Maybe he and the other children in the White House were on their way to the Chocolate Factory.
oh good god!!!
Get a life!
Anything else you want blame trump 4 dems are real losers.they r finished.go get comfort cockroach to keep you calm.cry babies.
Next things, he'll be tweeting out the Nucleur Codes or leaving them in Russian hotel rooms.
but emails...
and Jina...
we didbut no one listened
Oh my Gosh the Key of Death laying out for all to see
by the way, if The Donald gets impeached, the liberals like you will wish you never lived. There are more of us than you think!!!!!
Sure sounds like a threat of harm! Maybe you should be reported!
what good is a single key vs government sponsored Russian hackers dismantling the entire country?! This article is a load of crap.
It is ok, hillary is not there.
But didn't you like my very very many yuge stacks of paper?
Because Trump is "like a smart person" that is why.
yes. He's "like" a smart person in that they both breathe oxygen. 
looks like the desk of a ten year old or a rookie trader.
Is it the same Senator who let 3 Muslim Terrorists serve as his IT department?
That's rich. Bc of all the things they've been called out publicly. And will soon be revealed.
The real classified info are on Putin’s desk.
Stupid is not a strong enough word.. Neither is incompetent..Unfit doesn't even come close!!
that senile embecile!!!
They should call him out for being an agent of a hostile foreign power too while they're at it. #ShowUsYourTaxes #investigatetrump
Because national security is so January 20th.
