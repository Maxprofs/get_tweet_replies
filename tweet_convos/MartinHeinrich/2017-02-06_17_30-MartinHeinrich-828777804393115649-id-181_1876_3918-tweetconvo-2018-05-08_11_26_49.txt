@SenateDems -Oh, by the way, Schumer knows the public schools are horrible, so he sends his kids to private school.The elite
@SenateDems -In Schumer's NYC over the last 8 years illiteracy of high school graduates has gone from 72% to 80%. Look it up
is she still alive? @JohnDunmoreLang
our public schools have made American kids some of the dumbest on the planet, since Nixon made the a Federal monster.
Unspoken assumption that this is a bad thing. Cites? Or merely noise?
Sounds like a good way to keep a larger percentage of Blk and Brwn Ppl from getting a good ed, i wonder if that was on pupse
cry me a fucking river.  Everyone will survive the next 8 years and our kids will be perfectly fine.
My greatest fear is seeing education go the way of healthcare #NoonDeVos
you of all ppl should get behind school choice. NM is at the bottom of every list when it comes 2 schls
unions have ruined public schools, turning out gov. dependent, unemployables, criminals, Dem. voters.
68% of Voters want school choice. The number is even higher among minorities.
@SenateDems I am troubled my sons PUBLIC, high school made the "most violent list" in the state of Florida. We had to move.
yes on DeVos. My kids had to go 2horrible Santa Fe Publix didn't make lottery into charters Xcept Tierra Encantada= Terrible

This is the most frightening thing about this whole charade. Absolutely no senate check on Bannon and crew. https://twitter.com/SenFranken/status/828975579395477504 …
@SenateDems Sorry Public Schools SUCK Right Now.
 We all know it!!
@SenateDems thank you. It would be a major defeat for our children & country. Please continue to fight @cyn_bklyn @KJencius
Tell me why DeVos is such a good pick then 
Do you really expect him to have any rhyme or reason? #idiocracy
@SenateDems -(1/2)The democrats have done a good job of destroying public education over the last 8 years . Led by Schumer.
@CParks777 She also promotes a weird anti human-rights brand of Christianity. They are as anti human is it gets. Dangerous
this is extremely disturbing @MartinHeinrich
Dangerous because they R ignorant about the source of truth; not introspective; to include values of human life.
she's nothing compared to his pick 4 deputy sec of state
@AIIAmericanGirI @AmericanFamAssc Voters know Dems & teachers unions, not DeVos are responsible for failed public schools!
thank you for standing up and speaking out to #StopDeVos! Our kids deserve better.
schools passing kids n Algebra Geometry- can't multiply , divide.Tierra Encantado, illegals, all Mexican, no diversity, fake
don't think she can mess up our school system no more than it is. Get rid of teachers unions
@SenateDems I'd vote for her in a minute.  Just unions and bad teachers don't like her
what a load of crap. Family made billions on literal pyramid scheme scam, but you think supporting school choice is her sin.
@SenateDems she is wholly unqualified.
yes we did, wish we had him back.
@SenateDems Heinrich, conservatives would do the maneuver and save you from your lies! U r shocking on ur believes! We try!
Don't you mean "beliefs", or did you get a Betsy DeVos educ & simply can't spell or write a sentence
looking like I, may not live in a meth trailer! Maybe I'm delusional perinoid state! Obamed will pay for my therapy and cell
You really should be in a cell, or a cage. So sad when dumasses like you can only fight back with insults instead of facts.
What facts have you offered, Glenn?
wonder how much Glenn is being paid to be a troll?
social media use as an opinion . Not to get in a back and forth personal spat!
unfortunately it's too late she's already been sworn in
so glad you're "troubled", multiply that by 100 and that's how the rest of us feel.
jusdy another unqualified rich pig that bought her way into our govmt.  Trump loading the swamp with more rich reptiles!
DeVos reminds me of the daft but creepy coworker I suspected of storing dead cats in the freezer. 
#NoLunch4Me
She doesn't believe it is necessary for the majority!
@SenBobCasey Urge you to be a PROFILE IN COURAGE #DeVos is not just UNQUALIFIED She is DANGEROUS to future of PUBLIC SCHOOLS
That's twisting it beyond recognition. She has promoted competition and choice with vouchers. Competition is good.
Good. The tax payer funded system obviously hasn't done any good no matter how much money we've thrown at it.
and your point is? Should the poor not bE allowed a better education?
DeVos has spent 28 years increasing the profit of her company interest in for - profit charter schools. She profits.
The glazed eyes & mumbling about Guns & Grizzly bears were so odd. Like some sort of flashback. Nutty
@SenateDems  public schools are broke bad , you are only want liberal teachers, not fair .. #ConfirmDeVos
@SenateDems  we need better teachers , all we have now is liberal teaching to indoctrination to build liberal voters 
that's why we support her.  Time the the Dept. Of indoctrination to be dismantled.
public schools destroy our children. lower the bar so many failures to let them pass... diploma means nothing anymore
Good
Because Teachers Union is what is important. Not the children.
public schools fail our students. teachers don't  care just out for a pay check! I have a valedictorian son tech and college
At 600$ to wire a outlet,Printing Paper 20$, Toilet paper5$, Kickbacks from approval's, Meanwhile Teachers pull$ out pocket
You say that like it's a bad thing.  How do private school compare, scholarship-wise, with public? @MartinHeinrich
honestly im more concerned with the fact her brother is founder of blackwater and has a religious agenda.
yeah because public schools have been the poster child of achievement and efficiency
@SenateDems thank you!!
@TheLauraAbernat I am #TheResistance #NoOnDeVos
#NoOnDeVos #DumpDevos To all the Senators standing up for education:  THANK YOU! Stay strong! We have your backs!
That's. The. Point.
She has a record almost as bad as the Govt. schools in this country.
Remember "Waiting for Superman" Documentary? Nope! America's been "Waiting for DeVos" #FreeKekistan
Look at the data. Charter and Private schools have much better over-all results. Teachers Unions/Tenure = Shitty teachers.
IF DEVOS IS CONFIRMED, EVERY VOTER WITH SCHOOL KIDS MUST REMEMBER THIS DURING 2018 MIDTERM ELECTIONS!
Public schools are dumpster fires. Let parents direct school funding, and watch quality skyrocket.
DeVos ... short for "DeVoided of Schools"
Maybe you haven't noticed that no matter how much money is poured into public schools, US results haven't improved one iota?
Yet they didn't stand up to stop trump
@McBiffing vote no then!
Yes she has.  Plus she is ignorant of education and laws.
yes that's the point. Imagine giving kids an education instead of protecting the teachers union.
convince fellow Sen Udall to get Mormon Church to realize Devos will hurt Mormons. avg Mormon family cant afford charters
taken a look at public schools lately? The performance? The cost? And you want more of the same? Good thing we had our say.
Mr. Heinrich, you have the most wonderful staff members in your New Mexico offices ... very patient; very polite!
These are some harsh words senator. Maybe replace those words with reform & start to replace. I don't support DeVos btw
thanks to Reid - she's a show in- thank you DNC
@jappille i'm troubled that you aren't using the same amount of energy to vote out his other nominees
@SenateDems Your "troubles" will end 2018! System is BROKE & we've VOTED to fix it!! #MAGA of stay out da way! FREE CHOICE!
thank you Senator. #NoonDeVos
It is high time that public schools get their shit together or get out of the way. Fire the bad teachers & hire the best!
GET #RID OF THE #GOP IF THEY CAN'T REALIZE THAT #DEVOS IS BAD FOR #EDUCATION!
Our schools are horrible, leaving our children illiterate! Do you propose to just leave it the way it is?
maybe it's time to try something new, current policies seem to be broke. More $ is your only remedy. Give us a break.
@Brasilmagic However, under her watch kids in schools will be safe from grizzly bears!
@Brasilmagic then what awful idiot would propose her for secretary of education?
#DeVosBlackOut She is a disaster.
Thank you for voting no. privatization is only good for corporations, and not the people.
Dept of Ed is a black money hole. Since its creation , it has failed @ improving ed. Devos=Yes https://goo.gl/images/fWmz0v 
Listen to what DeVos is saying & not saying. She is not the solution our kids need. #NoonDeVos #holdthefloor
I'm troubled by that comma splice. Did you learn that at school, senator?
Say no to DeVos, stand up for public education. Thank You!
30 years of declining numbers. DOE has wrecked havoc on our schools.
@CharlesMBlow and she will do that to all public schools while stealing from student loan accounts also
@SenateDems Her ideas r not going to work in small towns & rural areas. Those r the areas that DT said he was going to help!
Thank you! Grateful to have senators who are willing to stand strong.  Please continue to fight the Republican agenda.
@SenateDems her and her backers want their money. Greedy.
@SenateDems The government did that
thank you!
Or maybe she has been working to get better results.  Are you suggesting public schools are performing well?
great! Now, we need you to reach across the aisle and convince a R to oppose her as well. Offer them a safe place.
here we go again. New Mexico ranks 40th on US public education and you have done nothing to fix but devos is the problem????
I hope you can stop her.
Thank you, Senator!  My kid on an IEP deserves a high quality public education & DeVos won't guarantee that.  #DumpDeVos
Thank you for standing up for the American people. Our kids deserve better! America deserves better! Thank You!! #noDevos
thank you
Please recruit one other republican to stand with you. Are there any sensible ones we can count on? Thanks for your vote.
@SenateDems thank you! #nodevos
Thank you for doing the right thing!
The way to destroy Democracy is to destroy education. Welcome to the Fourth Reich.

@SenateDems not to mention....just a few other concerns we people have,,, this really isn't a tough call. #DumpDevos
Because public schools have failed the poor, black children in Detroit.  Why do you want them to have a terrible education?
And what she has accomplished is to see CHILDREN are rewarded with choice not stuck in teachers union failure
So are you voting against her or are you just “troubled”? @CharlesMBlow
@LeaBlackMiami I'm a former teacher. This woman is not qualified! #noDevos
I'm not eligible. I taught in NC. I agree NM needs massive changes in its approach to modern Edu.
@SenateDems Public schools are giant daycares. Get real.
@SenateDems Then, please make sure she doesn't get nominated! As parents, we want the best for our schools
@SenateDems please stand firm on not confirming Betsy Devos! Our children and our futures depend on it!
#No2PartisanPolitics
Thank you Senator!
Thank you Senator.  At least she'll scoop skandera out of our state.
@CharlesMBlow in my opinion she will destroy usa's schools. .but gop wants everything destroyed...us included
They are off to a good start at destroying everything!! 
thank you
@CharlesMBlow Devos=schools as profit centers. PLEASE this only works for wealthy who send their kids 2 private school
@SenateDems I support your block! Stand tall and proud
I don't know why I even waste my time on here its not like you read any of this anyways. You just follow an agenda!
Surely you realize that that is exactly why Trump nominated her. They both want to get rid of public schools.
Do you support School Choice? 
Yes/No - Why?

Thanks for voting No!
ADULT LITERACY RATE IN NM IS ~54%. Our schools suck! Need changes.
@CharlesMBlow AZ governor bragging about 2% teacher raise over a 5 year period. Devos would think that $2/ week is to high!
Your answer is spend more! What a joke! The system sucks now and has for a long time.
@SenateDems and somehow seems to know nothing about education
@SenateDems I'm troubled by the fact decades of you guys throwing $ at the problem has not made a damn bit of improvement.
@CharlesMBlow   You're troubled? I'm infuriated.
@SenateDems perhaps it's time to change our education. Stats show our ranking getting lower over years. #voteyesdevos
You got to be kidding! 
wow the finger! Thanks. That helps your stance. Lol
that is not the middle finger look I was pointing at your comment, can believe you said yes to her.
Rochford  all ARDCFRAUDS. Junkies bad behavior. @DEAHQ @ISBEnews failures in reporting crimes tribunal in the 
We spend over 11,000 dollars per year per student and rank 14th in the world. Lol
thank you for fighting for my kids!!
@CharlesMBlow as a Michigan parent let me be clear. Do not let this woman destroy your schools too.
@CharlesMBlow
@CharlesMBlow I agree, get a fellow Repub to vote NO
@maysoonzayid screw "troubled" try "outraged" That suits the situation better
FUCK "troubled" !!
Never mind busting unions

thats because public schools are garbage!
@SenateDems thank you for standing up for public education
@SenateDems If you care so much about education why are we behind other nations? You don't care, this is all politics
Isn't she great? Vote YES on DeVos.
@SenateDems don't let her even further Dumb down American voters!!
@SenateDems Schools of choice recruit students who would succeed anyway and do not serve the most needy students.
@SenateDems #blockdevos
@SenateDems How much did the teachers unions pay you for that "opinion"
Say NO to DeVos!
I would almost bet a 1,000 dollars your kids don't go to public schools.
The public school system sucks and now with common core it double sucks!
tell  it!!!
Thank you for all the hard work you are doing, not only for NM, but all of America!
@suejohnston56 http://www.newsy.com/stories/detroit-student-speaks-out-against-betsy-devos/ … Detroit Student speaks out about DeVos.
Thank you, Senator!
I homeschooled mine. You are a #LIAR and obviously do not know anything about #Online #ParentCHOICE #Freedom Geta clue #MAGA
curious to know what your kids do for living if they are old enough
My brother home schooled his kids, all of them more educated than what public schools are producing
Charter schools help poor family's send our children to better schools.
only if you're accepted. and they will/can deny entry for any reason they want.
Could be true.  But the nominee will be approved anyway.
