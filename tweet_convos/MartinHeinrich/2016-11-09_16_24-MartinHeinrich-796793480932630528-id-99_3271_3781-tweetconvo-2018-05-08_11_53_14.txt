Uhhh shouldn't national parks be fee free for all veterans and taxpayers year round?
national parks are free for active-duty military:
Only 124 of 400+ national parks charge entrance fees http://nps.gov/planyourvisit/ …
There's a debate b/w taxpayers covering full cost of parks vs having those who use parks pay—Congress allowed fees since 1916

since when do i need to pay for a vist to the park as taxpaying citizen that i have all ready paid
There's debate b/w taxpayers covering full cost of parks vs having those who use parks pay—Congress allowed fees since 1916
why shouldn't it be free? After all it was STOLEN from native americans... wtf should you charge for admission? Bastards!!
There's a debate b/w taxpayers covering full cost of parks vs having those who use parks pay extra—decision is up to Congress
should be those who use them. Most Americans never see these places. once Trump does his damage we'll be living there as squatters
@ChelseaClinton We told u we would #DemExit we told u to focus on the black comm but u did Latino only #BlackVotesMatter
Dems abandoned the union voter with outsourcing and coal miners and theyll abandon AA's too.
@POTUS abandoned us 4 8yrs and H just talked about Latino issues
@nozippbags @realDonaldTrump  Will take this way from us. Those who voted for him, don't even know this exist in America!
“@Interior:On #VeteransDay,U can visit national parks,wildlife refuges&public lands for free.RT to spread the word! ”
David Paulidas ,missing 411 ,release the foia,on missing UFO ,monsters chasing the dragon.
@ChelseaClinton or visit a suffering depressed veteran at VA that Obama & Hillary failed to remember #ShameOnYou
And do it soon, before their national park status is revoked or before drilling and mining begin.
@ChelseaClinton foundation investigation is good
DISGRACEFUL. ...Charge the hard working tax payer to see a piece a land our forefathers STOLE.
@kswift_crow unless one is being occupied by a militia group.
I will be working !
Sweet!
Better get there quick before trump and his boys frack and mine them all.
you mean land purchased with our tax dollars?  gee, thanks. @sunset
keep these sacred places safe from developers, fracking and, most of all, Palin. #WereStillHere
Yas love
On #VeteransDay, you can visit national parks, wildlife refuges & public lands for free.  @Interior
Only problem is most veterans like me can't afford a trip to any of the parks, we're impoverished.
Everyone better hurry. The Republicans plan to allow corporations to rape and pillage our public lands and wildlife for profit.
Don't you have some grifting to do? Get a real job honey. The corrupt gravy train is ending.
America is Trumpland! 
#VeteransDay @Interior @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @GOP @SenJohnMcCain #VeteransDay #WarHeroes #POWs
Thanks for honoring men and women veterans
beautiful, visit soon before these cherished places are turned into oil fields or Scion casino's.
go Parking!  
going out of business soon?
@ChelseaClinton 
Are you still holding mum back from jumping off the balcony?
if you know someone who is a #veteran, tag them in here and we all can pay them #respect
.@Interior Should be everyday for #Veterans
#VeteransDay
Will you still have a twitter account after 1/20/17?
will anyone have a twitter account?  how do people freely express how they feel about something in Russia?
@ChelseaClinton Well at least u can look at this while u Feel the Bern. Don't cheat and treat B sup like sheep! #BernieStrikesBack
@ChelseaClinton truly beautiful! Visit #CanyonDeChelly too stunning #canyon
@ChelseaClinton feel so bad your mom didn't win 
thanks for sharing
@reedvd cool!
But be cautious of cartel run areas where foreign thugs will kill you if you get too close....in obama's open border America. @Interior
Soon to be sold to private interests, raped for resources and left for dead.  #MassiveResistance
Your tweet is currently ranked #1 on the #VeteransDay scoreboard! http://tagr.us/Zg/Interior 
visit our public lands before the new admin includes them in their restrictive policies
@EdneaBassi
I wonder if we will have national parks, wildlife refuges & public lands when Trump gets thru with his agenda. #sad
We won't. The EPA will be destroyed and the environment with it and public lands will be sold off. #sad
Really, REALLY #sad  We can't be silent.  @Interior @finolahughes
Yeah, I agree. The GOP runs everything now. Who can we turn to?
We the people. I demonstrated in 1968 (Chicago Convention). And this is reviving the activist in me. @finolahughes
Thank you for that! I'm embarrassed I said that to you! You are right. I need to be a part of that same spirit!
Don't be. It's a valid question. The fight has 2 start TODAY. Black-white, gay-straight. ALL OF US. @finolahughes
@SnakePlisskn
And do it now, becuz the GOP now has the power to implement its plan to sell much of this off to the highest bidder.
@AshleyJudd visit while you can. Many in GOP wish to see these lands sold for fracking and mining.
take one last long look before the Republicans and Trump destroy it all with drilling
@michikokakutani soon to be destroyed
until Sarah Palin takes over. Then it'll be touring the oil fields. #tragedyofthecommons
Sounds like it's time to take Friday off of work and go hiking.
You might fly up to hike the beautiful tundra of Bering Land Bridge NP free on Veterans' Day:
do we have to worry about this?
and if we ignore global climate change sites like these will slowly whither and die
see the parks before trump sells them to oil and gas
Not after Sarah Palin become Secretary of the Interior.
perfect places! Time to marvel @ what nature gives us, reflect on the past &  contemplate the days ahead! #VeteransDay #givethanks
@BillWeirCNN when does Sarah Palin move in?
do it before it is too late
also are you ready for Don the elephant killer trump jr to be your new boss? Word on the street... #wefailedplanetearth
gorgeous
I'll miss this most of all....
beautiful gorgeous land Dumpf is going to sell off to the highest bidder #merica
Mike Woodburn sauys ty all and god bless

@swiffydk Well, they'll be privatized soon, so let's enjoy them while we can

@ClaraJeffery while they still belong to the people.
