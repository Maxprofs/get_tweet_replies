@ealight461 Thank you. Also support postponing the Electoral College vote until investigation is complete
I also support an investigation into the Clinton Foundation and all the foreign donations.
They have been investigated. Where have you been for the past 6 months?
No, they havnt investigated the Clinton Foundation, and I am SURE, you haven't investisgted it.
THANK YOU!  Please also consider supporting the independent audit of DJT finances.
Also audit the Clinton Foundation.
Republicans will never accept an independent commission, fear has them by the shorts. to much dirt to hide.
Yes, I agree. Much more dirt than information released in #PodestaEmails
What about Saudi/Gulf State interference? @MartinHeinrich @joss
Obama mocking Romney's concern about Russia: "The 1980s called -- they want their foreign policy back."
@joss will you investigate the DNC for interference by the DNC in the primaries in favor of Hillary
@joss they didn't interfere they hacked an email account and it showed the corruption
Do you also support actually enforcing the intelligence laws that were broken, thus making a hack possible?
@DebraMessing why can trump do whatever the hell he wants and no one is stepping up to tell him it's not OK?
what does that accomplish? What do you see as the end game there? Chaos, regardless of what is found, is most likely.
Thank you!
I'm for that too, but to what point. What power will they have to make change? They need a sword too.
Thank you!!
@joss Russia did not do this

Thank you!
Nice idea. But... (insert dozens of reasons here)
https://democracynow.org/2016/12/13/electoral_college_members_seek_intel_briefing …
suspend electoral vote and inauguration until ...
Thank you voice of reason and integrity!
@Cajsa i support one to investigate russia's role in the total destruction of syria, including war crimes.
If you want to deprecate the idea of investigating the election to push this, fine, but Trump loves Putin.
Not my intention. I'm so mad at Russia right now. I just don't want to lose sight of ALL the Putin evil.
Yes, Putin is doing evil all over the world, and most outrageously and openly in Syria.
Well ok then! Still won't stop Trump
could ya maybe get that done before we put ppl who committed TREASON in the Oval Office?
Thank you. Please advocate for a delay in #ElectoralCollege vote until all electors are fully briefed.
Go for it!  Aside from Russians' innocence, I'd like 2 see the govt. prosecute some1 4 "election rigging by exposing truth".
Thank you, Martin.  One less phone call for this NM resident to make.
@joss Dudes, you can lose, but don't be sore losers. That's what you are right now, SORE LOSERS.
@ScottNevins thank you

@RepSwalwell; How come there was no investigation after Dems primary when the hacks revealed that DNC favored Clinton??
Thank you for being a great Senator for NM & USA!
@LoriWest2 I support one into how our media influences elections and how foreign donations do as well. Let's be fair.
thank you sir.also think  the electors have all security agencies findings de-classified to take into consideration b4 vote
Why just the Russians? We know for a fact DHS did hack our election. Or do you continue to give  Obama a pass.
@joss And delay @ElectoralCollge vote until done 2 ensure we're not installing 2016 version of the Manchurian Candidate.
@RepSwalwell this is distracting from the resistance to fascism. I expect more form you ! #NoPasaran
@RepSwalwell Me too, but what's the goal? If Trump is inaugurated then they win.
Thank you, Senator.
and postpone the electoral college and inauguration.  simple.
thank you! Please remind everyone that the #electors have a sworn duty to protect us from foreign influence.
We need a comprehensive bipartisan investigation into Russian #InfoOps including news media outlets and social media.
If US intel first investigates these Twitter accounts for Russian interference, it could save US time and money. #Applefraud
Please share #SecureUkraine policy doc about #InfoOps in Ukraine. Russia is using them now in U.S.
Comprehensive examination of Russian #InfoOps in news & social media will prevent a legitimate cause to question democracy.
thank you
@cupcakekitty09 and quickly.
Sounds great. What then?
@joss why the hell wouldn't you?
@PaladinCornelia thank you!!!
Nazi much?
thank you!!! @TheDemocrats sb all over this and ready to fight every step of the way! No repeat of the Reagan yrs, please!
thank u!
Thank you, sir.
@capncarissa What do you hope to get out of an investigation? Seriously.
Yes. Thank you.
thank you for putting America first! This must be IMMEDIATE investigation! #russianhack #factsmatter #Putinspuppet
but, but, isn't Russia an unimportant regional power that is only good at nothing?
It MUST be independent.  Unfettered and not tied to politics.  We need to get to the bottom of this.  #nocompromises
ok how many years will that take?
Thank you, Senator Heinrich.
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!! 
Mahalo!
@POTUS transparency in insuring the integrity of the process is "imperative" com'n Obama
hear hear! this should concern all Americans, regardless of party.
Please, Senator. Help us save America from Kleptocracy and Putin.  You're the voice we need to hear!
I support a lynching.
@joss they spent all the money for it on Benghazi.
Thank you!
@joss 
Postpone #ElectoralCollege Vote & #Inauguration Pending RUSSIA TAMPERING Investigation
@joss 
#ElectoralCollege #FaithlessElector
please take a stronger stand. Reject Trump till the end.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator. Please use your influence to pressure your colleagues into making this happen.
Thank you!
Thank you Senator Heinrich.
thank you for your duty to the Constitution and the American people
Thank you! #HERO
Thank you! Don't give up until that is achieved, it's VITAL for our national security. Please investigate Trump & Co.
#hero
Thank you Senator Heinrich. The American people deserve an investigation into this activity.
Thank You.
thank you...gotta move fast now!
Thank you sir. Regardless of party, we are all one nation. We must preserve that.
anything to keep Richard Burr from dictating the scope of the inquiry
Don't you mean *alleged* Russian interference? And how is revealing the truth "interference"?
Is this a joke? I don't support the waste of time. You have other things to do.
@Syndeess yes!
It cannot wait till after Jan 20.
Let's do this!
this is a waste of resources.
Thanks for your integrity. From a guy who voted for u twice.
