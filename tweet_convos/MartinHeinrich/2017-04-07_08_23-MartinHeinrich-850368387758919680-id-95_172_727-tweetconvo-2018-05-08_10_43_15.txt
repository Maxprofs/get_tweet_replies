GOP didn't change the rule. They only implemented the one your party has been using the last 8 years
Please stop this from happening!
And you failed
@SenateDems
Vote them out.
@SenateDems
Embarrassing that my Senator is such a cry baby... karma sucks Marty. Just look in the mirror and talk urself into manning up today
U libtards would not be happy if they hung u with a new rope
If the founding fathers could be resurrected. They would imprison or deport the GOP.
as they would the democrats.  don't act like one is better than the other.
#GorsuchStoleHisSupremeCourtSeat
Trump won election
Trump gamed the Electoral College --and he lost the popular vote
I know
@SenateGOP You could have #DelayedGorsuchVote until  #investigation.  Your President in under criminal Investigation. What's your hurry?
 
just says what your values are. Party before principle. Now we know
ONLY viable option to #EliminatePartisanshipCancer is for #moderates to lead
@SenateDems you don't even want to work with them! He is qualified but not "your guy" so you voted no. Childish
the seat was stolen even before that. for the first time in history a supreme court nominee was denied a hearing. Lock Trump up.
No nominee has ever been confirmed in the final year of a presidency, learn your history.
Makes you look out of touch and frank;ly stupid
URGENT! 1st House Seat #election TUES in Kansas4th In state or not #Resistance DONATE, PHONE BANK, DRIVE VOTE! 2018 is now! #EverySeatCounts
Keep voting no! That's exactly what We The People are going to continue to do Vote No Stop government corruption division illegal activities
What good did it do

#Gorsuch joins #Alito to champion "relig freedom" of Christian majority to discriminate. Note wording: "EVANGELIZE" http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/samuel-alito-we-must-evangelize-our-fellow-americans-on-religious-freedom/article/2617573 â€¦
Good! Thank you.
You let them apparently cause you didn't stop it with a cause of action-no rules changed if it was there 2 use!
Wrong move!
Well that is why you haven't got the backbone of a worm but the brain of a sandflea.
@SenateDems stay strong!
Nov 8th voters selected SCOTUS! The sooner U come to terms with that the better 4 .
Our Founders are turning in their graves
It's sad that you are hard head
Looks like your vote really meant a lot! Thanks Harry Reid..
Knock yourself out, Martin. Try to understand the process, ok?
Guess what? You LOST!!! Talk to Harry Reid
Is Trump functionally illiterate? Probably! @DSenFloor @HouseDemocrats @TheDemocrats @DNC @TomPerez @NancyPelosi @SenateDems @tedlieu
If Trump is suitable to be POTUS if he can't even read reports? @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @FoxNews @nbcsnl @maddow
What's wrong Snowflake? Don't like your own party's tactics? Your party and Obama are a total disgrace to the nation!
Thank you for trying!
We can Thank Harry !
Like the dems did in 2013
Resist resist bwahahaha
Move on. Everyone else has already. Next time do your job.
To late
Rekt
Do you lie to your constituents all the time or only when your lips move? #ThanksHarryReid
"Elections have consequences"
You need to get a life and not in our government
Obstructionist
Harry Reid changed the rules! Many in NM will vote "NO" next time you're up. 100% YES for Gorsuch to Fed. Court. Politics ruined the process
Sure did.
Good. I hope you all decide to get back to work now. Your plan is not working.
They say it's a huge win, I say it's not because they couldn't confirm him without changing the rules. The dems will take back over.
Too late.  Thank you Harry Reid.
The "Nuclear option"  was created by Harry Reid and the demonrat goons. Backfired hahaha.
@SenateDems good job! With you voting no you have destroyed senate tradition and Gorsuch was confirmed anyways!
sad day for usa
Love this day! Dirty Harry changed the rules or did u forget!!
Who knew Harry Reid was a Republican??
You Dems changed the rules before this, now reap what you sow. #Hypocrite
Thank you!
No No Dems changed the rules. Came back to bite u didn't it.
Thank you
Thank you!
Huh, you were already told. Democrats changed the rules.
Why even have a vote when republicans can just change rules & get whom ever they want in office. GOP WH doesn't even see fit to include dems
Democrats need to unite and make our voices heard in 2018 and 2020. We no longer have a democracy...looks like Putin won.
Senate Dems changed the rules to allow it. Didn't hear you complaining in 2013 #StopComplaining #Puppet. #NuclearOption is Dems fault, ownit
So true, so true
Thank you!
good job.  Keep up the good work.  Republicans will soon be the minority again and won't be able to screw things up more
Democrats change the precedent for confirming a SCOTUS nominee. Filibuster / Nuclear Option. Time for GOP to fight back.
Congress has no right to demand they be in process of President's selection for a nominee!!!  Live with it Dems!!
That's the correct action - hold strong - send a message that you can't just change the rule book
Your guy terrible Harry started it and you r complaining. Get over it!!!
TY. Sad, tragic day for USA.
good for you,,no one gives a shit what you vote.
Prepare to get voted out when you go up for reelection
Agree Dems will have it rough in '18
Prove you wouldn't have voted no either way by voting yes.
Could it have anything to do with Dems changing to rules in 2013? Or launching a politically based filibuster ok the nominee? Thanks, Harry!
That's okay. He'll still win
