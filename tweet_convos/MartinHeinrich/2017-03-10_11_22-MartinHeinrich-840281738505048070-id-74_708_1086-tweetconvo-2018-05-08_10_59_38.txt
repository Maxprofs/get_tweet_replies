Watch GOP lawyers admit that repeal plan will cut off coverage to millions  suffering from mental illness & addiction. #ProtectOurCare #ACA 
@RepJoeKennedy #Kennedy2020
@RepJoeKennedy #trumpcare wants to prevent mentally ill from having access to healthcare but not to guns?!!
#Trumpcare is not healthcare; it is healthprofit.
@keraz37 The sad thing is that anyone with a half of brain could predict Trump and GOP would give the shaft to the least.
@dalseyd 
One day Trump will need mental health.
#AllLiesMatter
@RepJoeKennedy @Chaos2Cured
We're not going back to denial & institutionalization for deadly illness that's treatable. Stop the stigma. #socialwork
@RepJoeKennedy HELP!  Please HELP US n KY! Heroin/addiction/mental health! Us against pharma, alcohol, Koch $$ Please HELP
@RepJoeKennedy "I'm sorry sir, it does what?"@RepJoeKennedy wasn't letting him off that easy. A true American patriot. 
@jlq529 It's sinful that so many of them voted for him
@StephenWunderl4 @RepJoeKennedy they take away mental healthcare AND made it easier 4 those with issues 2 buy  makes sense
@RepJoeKennedy Thank you, Rep. Kennedy, for your deep compassion for ALL people & for working to protect our Healthcare!
@ThomasJ17762016 well at least they can buy guns
only the 1s with mental issues are Dems that are able 2 buy guns. Close that loophole.....
and now it's going to be easier for those mentally ill to buy guns too!
prevent Democrats from owning guns and problem is solved. Those are the 1s with mental issues. 1/2
@RepJoeKennedy-I'm 35 yr RN, Fact! Many Americans didnt understand  ACA policy best for THEM, frustrated, picked what ever!
Took us @6 hrs to evaluate. WHO DO TOU KNOW THAT TOOK THAT MUCH TIME?? Prob no one!
Continuing the Kennedy legacy. The torch has. Even passed and the dream lives on!
@RepJoeKennedy  Not getting the healthcare that millions of people need who have a mental illness is disgusting & shameful 
Remember after every mass shooting rather than gun control repubs always carried on about the mental health system.
which you created with the liberal education system. Ppl are so screwed up bc of it. Transgender or drug addicted 2 control
so glad to have congressmen like @RepJoeKennedy who understand servant leadership 
People who suffer PTSD, Brain Injuries and children with mental issues, just to mention a few, against abortion babies suff
@RepJoeKennedy mental illness and addiction are two different subjects and shouldn't be lumped into one.
@RepJoeKennedy Trump instead makes it easier for them to buy guns. Hmm. The true face of his health "care" may be showing.
@RepJoeKennedy
Foreign corps hyped drugs with explosive abrupt-withdrawal effects, and guns into hands of many trurnt by fear. Incoming fx!
@RepJoeKennedy keep fighting for this!!
@RepJoeKennedy Please don't let them do this to our country's mentally ill!!!
THANK YOU for standing up for
mericans battling mental illness and addiction. This def needs to be addressed.
@RepJoeKennedy  Pls HELP KY. Ineffective Ky politicians are killing us! Ky is one if the MOST UNHEALTHY STATES ALREADY!
I'm with Joe! Maybe that should be a hashtag #ImWithJoe
irland Portirico .. state hood
it's the end of the world as we know it! The sky is falling! The sky is falling! You all need to take a breath. Hystrionics.
The plan seems to not offer service but guns to those w/ mental health issues. Does this Administration hope they all die?
@MelindaThinker Don't Forget The $600 Billion Dollar Tax Break For The Rich
@SoulCodesMSW ones who voted for Trump deserve it, dumbasses, what did they expect, feel bad for ones who didn't
@galindohelen2 West Virginia has the highest proportions per capita of both! Goodbye West Virginia!
@Forbrydelsenfan Stop attacking and complaining and get to work then. You sound like a sookie babie, be a man.
@RepJoeKennedy And yet the GOP wants mentally ill to be free to buy guns.
@RepJoeKennedy u and carrot top are shameful look at ur own party wide abortion whew u got nothing so pick on success libs
Speaking of addiction... What are you doing to get rehabs and treatment centers in NM???Or even quality jobs to lift ppl up?
Interesting that the US claims to be the greatest country in the world. Far from it, sorry to say.  .@GOP
@RepJoeKennedy; That's how you shut them down tell truths nothing but the truth, like when you throw water on the witch..
@VLVANCE 

But at least they can buy guns. 

#DemandTheSamePlan
@avocams @RepJoeKennedy 
Also shameful Kennedy is an antivaxxer
@RepJoeKennedy #JoeKennedyForPresident
I agree
in the biged spirit of GOP they can now buy guns
@RepJoeKennedy @allinwithchris just heard you on All In W Chris. You are a Hero for our United States  of America Thank U!
@RepJoeKennedy And Joy to hear Your words of GreatThinker! THANK YOU SENATOR KENNEDY

@RepJoeKennedy give it to them your dad and uncle would be proud
Very True! Heck they are already cheering you on!
thanks for this joe. Keep fighting for us.
stop lying this doesn't cut coverage they have no coverage now we don't even have a system to hold or help them now! Fools
This situation isa double edged sword.Thiswill surely increase 2018#s2 remove repugs but the suffering costly until reversed
@ThomasJ17762016 Well now can sell them guns... this is a win win for the GOP
@RepJoeKennedy Mental health is stigmatized too much as is. This adds further risk. Just look at our Vet population
@RicanInBoston Additionally, the House signed legislation to ensure that those with mental illness could buy guns... 
@RepJoeKennedy  Heartbreaking. Mental health/addiction issues are found in most American families. Speak for us, please!
@RepJoeKennedy Why don't we get the same medical plan the congress gets?
@ThomasJ17762016 @MartinHeinrich @RepJoeKennedy @SpeakerRyan yeah why don't we get the same insurance we pay for you
At the same time GOP has made it ok to buy guns.
Shameful? It's murder!
@ValleyPatriot @tickerguy @RepJoeKennedy Instead of money spent on Invaders spend on Americans instead  #ProblemSolved #Easy
