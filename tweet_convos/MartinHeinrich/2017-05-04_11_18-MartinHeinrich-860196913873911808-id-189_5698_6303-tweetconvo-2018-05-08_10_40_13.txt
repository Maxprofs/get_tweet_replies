Obamacare is a disaster and the House did the right thing.

That left wing conspiracy theory died when Trump attacked Syria.

Russia is allies with Assad

Put two and two together if you can
Thank you Senator Heinrich. You are a class act.  Thank you for not selling out like the soulless senators from Oklahoma 
he is a terrific senator and he doesn't forget about the people who put him in office
Thank you @MartinHeinrich for protecting our health! This bill would turn me from #cancersurvivor into a #iamapreexistingcondition!
Good luck.  Trouble is it'll be some time b4 the death statistics show up.
Thx!
Of course. But I'm tired of retweeting, of phone calls, of reposts, I'm FAXING reps for goodness sakes!... If you want to be leaders, LEAD!
I've called, wrote, faxed, retweeted & posted.   I have even adopted other congressmen (I have Enzi, Barasso, Cheney).  I'm not quitting.
Nor am I, but we sure could use some better support!
That is for sure ele
I've seen a listing of senators on the committee.  Why no women?  Why just men making healthcare decisions for women.  Unacceptable.
We are with you.  Just stay after all things Trump.  And, dump Trump!
Thank you.
I scrolled through a few of the responses, and most were heartfelt "our lives are in your hands now." #CluelessGOP
@SenateDems please save us. It is a death sentence for me! Thank you!
Hey knucklehead why don't you get involved and make it a better bill.Obamacare is gone , broken. Help fix instead of being a political  dope

I hope not! We've got a MAJOR cover-up and OBSTRUCTION on our hands. We are almost in a crisis state. Hope congress does their job!
Please, do and urgent your Colleagues in Texas to do the same. We need more transparency/accountability from insurances to quit gouging ppl
How will you fight tooth and nail?? Work with Republicans to defeat this bill? Voting against it is half the job.
Martin fight for us
#'TRUMPCARE Is a redistribution from poor to rich! Unbelievable this #POTUS.
Perhaps you should try to work with your "opposition" on making this into something workable Rather than continue grid lock or a 3rd attempt
Everyone who sees this start badgering @SenatorCollins, @lisamurkowski, @SenDeanHeller, and @BillCassidy so they vote no.
Got are backs. THANKS.
Fight!Fight!
Agree- have those voting yes use AHCA coverage for themselves and families for a year.  Prepare a report after the trial use for credibility
Dems are whiny loudmouths. When they won, it was fine, when Republicans win, they cry and shout, and act like fools. Shows who has class.
followthe $ andwhy no one knows the cost i know how much my cable costs should thecountry not know the cost of healthcare
Jeez, can I RT this a million times?
Thank you! We are counting on you and your colleagues
Thank you from Georgia.  @sendavidperdue @SenatorIsakson
The Democrats have fewer and fewer followers by next election you'll be all out.
Tired of your lies and corruption.
Tooth, nail, anything you can grab off the desk preferably. They're not gonna fight clean.
your Tweet was quoted in a story by @washingtonpost
Right there with you Martin. I will be contacting my Senators
Fight, fight. We'll have to take it to the streets!
.@MartinHeinrich with you .. what can I do
We stand with you @MartinHeinrich. Fight for what is right and for those whose voices/lives are being lost due to losing their heath care.
Thank you for standing up for my medically fragile daughter.
I've already told my children to start planning my funeral, if this passes.
Will all ppl get free coverage? I ask as most I know who have Ocare have 1k premiums and high deductibles and this is not for a great plan
@submergingmkt yes we are. Those who aren't are just confused.
Sorry Dude. It had to be passed. Perhaps you'd like to bail out ibsurabce companies who can't work with Obama Care anymore.
I support you!
Don't let that shit pass man
What is your stance? Dems need a platform to take action. Don't just resist, act!
thank you. NM will be hurt so bad.
Trumpcare =Nocare =Death and suffering.  Great distraction from his Russian conspiracy
Please!
I with!

What can we do as individual citizens now?
Save us from these monsters.
With you
Wish you good luck all the way from Europe!! @WillieGarson
Thank you sir. This is an atrocity!
How about you convince the citizens to start depending on themselves instead of letting the government hold their hands?
The senate really needs to start thinking about us the people. This so called healthcare should be used by congress and all politicians
*Everyone* is scared of cancer. Healthcare is PERSONAL. Watch @funder for list of @HouseGOP corporate donors: "it's their brand now" #NoAHCA
I am NOT with you.
Our man from NM! Take them to task Senator. #resist
Thank you!
What can we do now? DEM SENs will fight but the other 52 need convincing. GOP SENs can't be as ignorant as GOP reps..or can they? #RESIST

THANK YOU.
PLEASE DON'T LET  THIS HAPPEN PLEASE STOP THIS BILL

Kindly mention to colleagues a "yes" vote would be permanently laser-tattooed into the memories of more than a few of us lowly constituents.
Our lives are literally in your hands now.
Another loser Libertard. Lost the White House, Congress, the Senate, even the SCOTUS. Tired of losing yet?
Thank you Senator!
We are behind you, 100%! Fight the good fight, Sir.

Thank you.  Please help fight this horrible bill.
@NCPJKMKCABL #RepealAndReplace 
We the people voted & won the election. Red below represents counties Trump won to repeal 
3 million more PEOPLE voted for HILLARY CLINTON. Russia stole you an election.  You must be so proud.
illegal cotes don't count, electoral votes count more. Your fake blame Russia comments R boring
We need an army. A civilian army of lovers, thinkers, & fighters. We want to help you fight Senator
Ill fight tooth and nail to throw your sorry A@# out of the Senate in NM.
I hope you fucking mean it
Martin, are you on Obamacare? Rhetorical question of course. Not good enough for you, but good enough for all of us. Smh.
Push them to take action on all of the offered improvements ... medical costs, drug prices, int'l meds options, etc.  It could be great!!
Yes, I am with you. If this disastrous thing goes through, I suppose I should start planning my funeral.
Thank you for coming down on the right side of history. Anyone voting FOR #trumpcare = unemployment line 2018. 
@SenateDems 

"New Mexico" lmao
thank you
IMPEACH THIS CORRUPT ADMINISTRATION!!TRUMP RUSSIA
Lol, what did you just say? It was like a flash of blind rage and ignorance. Please explain how it is corrupt with facts and I will agree.
Crickets....Beuller? Beuller?? LOL
If americans can't afford dental insurance, about all they'll have left is the nails.
@SenateDems please save us. It is a death sentence for me! Thank you!
What exactly don't you like about the bill senator? Enlighten me.
Just like a GOPer, celebrating such a devastating act.
@SenateDems Were the Republicans really singing " hey hey goodbye"?
No.
God, please do. I'm one of the ones that will die if this passes.
Nov.6th 2018
