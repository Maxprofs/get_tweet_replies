.@MartinHeinrich clearly you're more interested in protecting the system & status-quo over children who continue 2B failed by the system.
how is @BetsyDeVos qualified in any way for that position? Still trying to answer that question.
#1 she's not beholden to the union #2 she's focused on what is best for the children #forthekids
#3 she recognizes that quality education must be accessible to ALL students
#4 she recognizes that a one-size-fits-all model does not work
#5 she believes in customized ed based on the individual student's needs
#6 will be a champion for parent empowerment over union empowerment
#7 supports giving power back to the states and local governments
Thanks!! All American kids deserve better.
#DeVos is not the ONLY answer to this. We can find someone better. Have U been to Detroit to see her influence?
Thanks, Martin. No also on Pruitt. Free the EPA. No on Mnuncin. @SenSchumer @SenWarren @SenatorTomUdall @tammyduckworth
as a former educator listening to her confirmation and info on her is scary. Information  Trump's cabinet is nuts!
Thank you for standing up for public education! @Lily_NEA @NEANewMexico @joinnealc

@AdrianaDynamite Thank you, thank you , thank you!!!
Why the no vote?
I live in NM and I strongly disagree with your vote. Status quo is not working. We need more choice.

Sorry you feel that way about not voting for President's Trump cabinet picks.  You will not get my vote this next election!
Thank you for not voting for DeVos.  Please do not vote to fund the Wall.
THANK YOU!!!! I've called your office several times on this isssue. THANK YOU for hearing us.
As an educator and parent of an NM student, thanks--but please be loud as to why DeVos is so dangerous. It's not partisan.
I am inclined to vote for your opponent in the next election. New Mexico deserves better.
I'm with you!  We need a qualified, pro-public-school nominee who can take on the problems with expertise and compassion.
thank you for standing up for our children. #DumpDevos
the one thing I may ever agree with you on. She is incompetent. We need someone who actually knows education
thank you
Please vote NO on Sessions and Tillerson as well.
and I'll make sure to vote against you in 2018. #NewMexicoDeservesBetter
