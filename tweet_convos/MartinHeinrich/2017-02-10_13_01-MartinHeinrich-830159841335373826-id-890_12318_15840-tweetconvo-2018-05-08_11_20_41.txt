in all fairness, maybe that's where Trump packs his lunch.
OH HECK!! ITS PROBABLY ONLY THE NUCLEAR CODES!!!
correct.  1000s of emails in her home from a closed secure network. Vs a locked bag in an office
the other after 16 years experience and thru deceit. So yes her fucking emails
Thank goodness Hillary Clinton, with her reckless disregard for security, isn't President.
But Jill Stein said that Killary would be much worse and lead us into war.  *HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER ENSUES*
Actually, she said time and time again that EITHER candidate would keep her up at night.
Evil and competent or evil and incompetent. I know which one I picked.
BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 
that's the bag with Hillary's emails! Dam let's lock him up !
Wait.... Hillary's email from her own secured server is much more important. Trump can do what he wants.
lol I didn’t pick up on the sarcasm at first. This is something a Trump supporter would actually say with a straight face, word for word. 
Ya think? Oh wait, he don’t, my bad.
.@realDonaldTrump seems to be totally ignorant of how classified material should be handled.  He does what he wants!  God help our country!
can't both be wrong? There were other options besides Clinton and Trump
But

If it's classified, then why tf are you tweeting about it?
Why has the US President not been trained in proper OpSec, and if he has why does the US Congress not investigate?
@curtisstigers @AP For a guy who won't read reports w/more than9bullet points,he's got an awful lot of paperwork on his desk
That's because he moves his lips when he reads.  He went to Trump U
Hey showman.  Guess you're not working on tax reform today?
we've never had such an array of incompetent, uneducated, arrogantly ignorant of how government works ppl running our nation
, how has this orange guy even received a security clearance? He's obv not able to handle this!
@realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi Can he get a fricking clue on how to safeguard secrets?  SAD
How do you know the CEO of Intel doesn't have a clearance, exactly?
this is an OPSEC violation with serious consequences... wait, who am I kidding here...
As Comey would say--this is extremely reckless and careless!!
but hey... her emails!

For the last time, son.  There were emails...
w
Thank you for sharing. Can we even call Agent Orange a criminals when criminals have better OPSEC??
Is the guy helping Donald learn to read?
See Jane run see Spot run 

Lock him up, lock him up!! Donald for Prison shirts? Too soon?
Not soon enough....LOCK HIM UP!
...in a padded cell
With a Hannibal mask and a straight jacket.
@realDonaldTrump
It suits him!
If a new administration were curious enough to learn the ropes, the learning curve would not be as steep as this one has made it. Now we've got domestic abusers working w/o proper security clearances. Next you know, we'll find out the Russians meddled in our election. Oh. Wait...
OK?
Didn't a hillary aid leave top secret unsecure computer with husband?

OH HAI #Deplorables & #BernieorBust ‘ers remember how you screamed & raged about EMAILS #TheResistance
Never leave a key in a classified lockbag in the presence of non-cleared people. #Classified101 (Original Photo @AP https://wpo.st/sAia2 ) 
"She's a threat to our national security!" screamed the ppl who actually are a threat.
Hell, Drumpf & co. will just hand over the key to Putin.
, will? Already has!
Aren't you cute.
Gotta ask, WTF are you talking about?
They carry classified documentation and are issued with the paperwork. That violates OPSEC
Chapter and Verse. What's been violated? OPSEC what? Which? Be specific.
opsec is operational security. regulations the DOD and DOJ instate to insure security of classified docs
There's little sense kicking the President for violating a rule if you can't reference the rule!
but he'll what would I know
The point being SOMEBODY better f**king tell him!! He's the President for f**ksake!
Oh. Just give him a chance. 

To completely kill us all.
Anybody who said "Just give him a chance" was asleep for all of 2015 & 2016.
now had Hilary been found doing this....
, or really ANYTHING Trump has gotten away with! She would be crucified a hundred times already! Pr. day!
But... her emails!
Forget the emails 
@HenryBLowery @AP

Morning

and the most dangerous of the group.  Be afraid, very afraid for whats next
Dude, if you're going to make a jibe, make it make sense. WTF are you quoting? What's the affinity to lockbags? Code?
Not a fan, but technically, he didn't "leave a key in a classified lockbag."
and you know there's classified material in the lock bag because…
because it's a classified lock bag. Keep up.
the contents of the bag (if any, which is my point) is what's classified, not the bag itself. Way ahead.
your Tweet was quoted in a story by @arstechnica
Ha ha ha the bag is empty like this worthless story. OMG it's a black bag with a key. Run run fast danger danger
Might have been empty!
@Ahurastan @AP on the off chance someone without clearance is in a meeting with @POTUS inside the Oval Office?  Check!
Yes, indeed ... Pres Trump takes security seriously!! SO SAD!!!
ummm.. hillary's emails comes to mind here
@maddow @AP what do they say about emails and destruction of government property/records? You dweeb. Lmao
And U did nothing to stop NSA from spying on us! U have no credibility at all.
What a bozo! Bet he won't say 1word abt Russia missile launched or Russian military jets buzzing US Navy ship! Absurd!
Too Stupid To Live=TSTL
I literally have no words.  How can this not be investigated? And because it's on the bottom of a pile he has NEVER read
@nicoq @AP what clowns
You can give "President" Trump a key, but you can't give him a clue!
in all fairness, a mistake I could have made.
@McTestaInc @AP tRump is an amazing AssHat
How can he get away with this?!
Actually, from a credential holder, this is perfectly fine by the law, and by best practices if cleared persons in room.
But Hillary's emails. @MartinHeinrich https://twitter.com/MartinHeinrich/status/830159841335373826 … #maga #tcot
Never leave a key in a classified lockbag in the presence of non-cleared people. #Classified101 (Original Photo @AP https://wpo.st/sAia2 ) 
@richardhine @AP but but Hillary's emails!!!! Lock her up!!! Hypocrites all hypocrites
Oh come on... Do you think somebody was going to steal something in broad daylight??
never leave a classified lockbag in a unsecured area!
if we left books on desk 4 coffee break instead of locked locker we were in trouble even thou everyone was studying same
@McTestaInc @AP no problem, it's a prop.
Trump don't give a damn about Country, The presidency is for his business purposes, nothing else
nice shot
Sure since the Intel CEO (or anyone allowed in the OO) would rifle through the papers on his desk unnoticed...
Thank YOU! When will Repubs WAKE UP & save Us? #RESIST
@dfspidell @AP
... and paperwork on the desk. In C-Suites, it is customary for nothing to be visible on the desk when visitors enter.
Hello Senator - Thanks for your efforts. Do you get the feeling this admin. may be a breached birth?
.@MartinHeinrich @AP - OPM hack of 22 million current and former Fed employees and now the MSM is concerned about security. Laughable.
@LeslieMarshall @AP you guys are living in your own private idaho
he is an idiot what did you expect?
But THANK JESUS he didn't have an unsecured e-mail server. Cuz THAT would be a real national security risk... #hypocrisy
@Maxeightyeight @AP 
He forgot, the old man is 70 years old.  He can't even keep his lies straight anymore.
He lies between syllables and no one is brave enough to step to donny & say, get yo stuff! Let's go!!
They don't want him to go. The GOP is enjoying their power, the media is enjoying their ratings.
Trump is careless with classified info, not only w his unsecured phone but also w materials on his desk.
He hasn't a clue what he's doing. He & CONservatives criticized Hillary/server, yet Trump's using an unsecure phone!
I just can't! What an idiot!

I always find it cute when progs pretend to understand national security, like kids playing Call of Duty.
Unless u have direct control over the bag, as is the case here. #ProgLies
Seriously?  Looks like a pile was just dropped off & seems a bit #hypocritical dont you think? Whateva' 
for f*cks sake #Emails #Benghazi
And here they had us worring about emails @duffy_man @MartinHeinrich @AP
confirming what everyone already knows: completely incompetent. SAD!!
somebody might put some  in there
In all fairness to Mr. Trump, that giant Ritz cracker is really impressive. I'm sure anyone would be absorbed by it.
it's OK... Russia already has all the classified info they want.
It's easy being distracted by learning time. Today he's being taught what a "circle" is.
Oh just pay this no never mind. But keep checking Hillary's emails!!!
How about taking a selfie with the person responsible for the codes and blasting all over FB?https://www.facebook.com/richarddeagazio/posts/10154937179614840?pnref=story …
@nycjim @AP 

Look at his hair for god sakes !

Do you think he thinks logically or rationally? 

Seriously, he is an idiot!
Someone (but who?) needs to have a long talk with the props department
Change all keys and codes. . . esp. nuclear codes.
forget the key… Look at the pile of papers!. He can't even keep his desktop organized. Let alone his office and beyond.
@AmarAmarasingam @AP I want to blame everything on the Propecia but its just he is an idiot.
Always leave the key in lock when bag is in ur office. U lock bag and remove key when securing documents 4 travel 2/2

guess we missed your tweets when HRC was compromising national security via email
@LordDarthBob @AP For the love of God! 
Are you kidding? INFOSEC is NOT a concern of POTUS or his administration! They have no idea what the acronym is!
Over 65 and a #2 amendment supporter?  
It is time to Clean the Swamp the correct way.   Starting at the Top.
As much as I HATE to mention this (I loathe Trump), how do we know that is a classified document bag, and not just a bag
Thank you again Republicans.  when does your gift expire?
@riotwomennn @AP the incompetence and arrogance it burns
@VanessaRumbles @AP Whats that man holding? #Puti'sPerferatedPizzaStone?
@headgeek666 @AP Because we all know they are criminals- No way you are this stupid Martin
Fake News is lying about me again! That is not a key! I will nuke them!!
@realDonaldTrump Stacks of paper dont make you look smarter - having confidential material on your desk is reckless
@OleHippieChick @AP  Great thing about this pic: MobsterDon doesnt even make-believe he is looking at any of those reports.
why do you think it was accidental ? it could have been done on purpose
I have no words
@MalcolmNance @AP asleep at the wheel?
Sloppy attention-to-detail = unsafe for US. 
@MartinHeinrich @Bvweir @AP
Lolo
Because you know it had something in it? Of what good is your petty tweet? Explain Rule 19.#Resist 
@SagiDiva1 @AP
Is that really a requirement? Because it seems you think it is but I bet you can't quote the regulation. Can you, Senator?
@AllBungled @AP Has that desk ever been cleaned since he's been there.. I may be wrong but I don't remember
-Obama's desk ever cluttered.
Jeezus he is so effing stupid
does anyone even know what the key is for i keep seeing this going around but what is the key even for fact not guess
Be fair If he took the key out you can be damn sure that hell lose it. Go easy on him. Its hard being King Of Everything
u lead a pathetic life
@ArtHauntsMe @AP Amateurs
that was his bribe to Trump.
Aapparently even good sense is too "establishment " #disrupt
@Dr_of_Nursing @AP This Presidenting stuff is bigly hard. I think Trump/ Bannon is in over his head.
tRump doesn't even care what happens. He's worried about his fucking girlfriend's fucking clothing line. Pieces of shit.
isn't that the same as private email server?!?
By posting this on twitter, it is clear that security is the least of your concerns
Good God.
@DLHeck @AP 
WFT!!!!
BUT HILLARY HAD EMAILS!!!
@Enrico056 @AP Nice catch!!!
I read everything no a days! 
Man Holding Disc: And this is the size of tRumps anus after talking with Putin and other handlers. Any questions?
why was a civilian allowed in an obviously unsanitized space??!!
@MrDanHerrera @AP he probably has the one with the nuclear codes open & plays show and tell with it! He's an idiot!
Holy DUH! We are in so much trouble.
@thekimdawson @AP Ugh. Probably leaves the biscuit in his bathrobe too.
true. but, isn't the President automatically cleared as Commander in Chief?
guess a combination lock would have been too difficult to remember
@helenmag @AP Hell the fact he didn't tweet the classified contents is more than I expected.
@CeleryCaraway @AP wtf
#45s admin has broken every law or rule, they vilified HRC for, but THEY get away, CRIMINALs!
Wonder how many past President's might have done the same?  Senator U R part of the problem/divide in this country.  Grow up
@ladykayaker @AP Grrreeeaaaaat.
Trump, Oh how incompetent you are... Let me count the ways. Smh
It is the bank bag that he uses for bribes from all the Corps that need favors
Guess he was using the facilities during that part of his orientation...
what the hell has to happen b4 #Congress gets a clue that this guy is a clear and present DANGER???
UNBELIEVABLE!!
are we surprised? This clown has made a mockery of our Country. Get him the hell out!!
In which whatshisface displays the new monthly ration of soylent green.
Lock him up!
He should have left the key on the table so random people could 3D print a copy of it ;-)
Hated Clinton witch hunt but pls quote reg? 40+ yrs never heard that, bag should be locked away around uncleared?
aww give Mrs. Putin a chance.
@maddow @AP  and they have the nerve to say they are trying to keep us safe.
just never ends so busy flashing Intel in front everyone like he had anything to do with he forgets/doesnt know abt key
@Bill_Shapiro @AP Leaves security key in the open. Who's looking for US security? Bannon? #danger

Yet more evidence @POTUS is unqualified and dangerously untrustworthy.
yeah but her emails.
Ooooh but those emails!!!!
Obama was such a BAD President, 8 years of do-nothing mediocrity caused long-term damage to Office itself
Attacking Trump actually demonstrates WEAKNESS & MEDIOCRITY, how Obama tore down dignity of Presidency
Obama staffers lucky enough to keep precious at White House should help a new President w/ 3 weeks on job
What Garbage!!! That's the White House, the Desk of the President of the United States! Spoiled Obama staffers who LOST
Reckless, careless, downright stupid or all of the above? You choose.
brilliant
@eighthdayarts @AP But he's the CEO of Intel!
thank you for being the sound of reason for New Mexico!
@SallyAlbright @AP wtaf
this might sound trivial but I've yet to see a pic of him with an organized desk
I signed NDAs for 20+ yrs; said I would goto jail for doing LESS than HRC did & you & your ilk did nothing about it
