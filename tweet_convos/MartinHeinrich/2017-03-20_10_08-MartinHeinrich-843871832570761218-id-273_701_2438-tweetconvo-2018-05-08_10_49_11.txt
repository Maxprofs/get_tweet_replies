@POTUS isnt strong enough. Or presidential enough.
@marieinal DT will never admit he's an ass 4 "Making" up such a claim against a "Real" POTUS.
VOTERS LOOK WHATS GOING ON.
we did
Yes, that will make everything alright again.  Sorry - I meant alt-right.
It boggles the mind, don't it?
no there need to be an independant investigation into the surveillance of the Trump campaign. @TGowdySC
@ncrist1968 he didn't make it up! Breitbart did lol
apparently @POTUS didn't make this up. What did you know and why did you try and hide this?
@BadASSSery I won't believe unless I see and hear it coming from his own lips.
and what if he didnt
Keep holding Trump, his administration and the GOP's feet to the fire.
why you never did to Hillary and obama
@SenSchumer  stop the Trumpcare!
unfortunately he's not capable of taking responsibility for his words or actions.
he dreamt of it, it gave him night mares & away he went w/ it next day. Sick man!
.@MartinHeinrich .@SenSchumer #smokescreen #distraction #shutdown
@tates5a Nope. He will double down, play victim, "Double Speak" ala "1984"
@SenSchumer fuck coming clean. HE NEEDS 2 BE FIRED !!!
@Harrietcreigh Not gonna happen. He's not capable of admitting he's wrong.
I have to let go. It's really going to kill me. He's such an idiot.
@GetBZLiving Yes. It's very distressing
@ThreeTouchDowns He won't! He will deny he made that tweet. Lie and deny
@ybbkaren Will.never.happen
Ur right -even though he needs to!
he didn't make it up. He half read a Breibart news article and then 100% committed to the false allegation. Half-assed liar
@solusnan1 
That narcissist "can't" admit he's wrong, ever
@SenSchumer That take balls,class n honesty.None of which he has.
So there was an investigation without surveillance. That makes no sense
.@MartinHeinrich @SenSchumer Oh?  The White House stands behind the wiretap claim, and it is still under investigation.  Presumptuous, much?
Trump did not make it up.  You know there are members of your party slimy enough to tap him and know why.
oh dear.
guys a sociopath. He never will admit fault. Why do peopke@keep expecting him to act normally?
Why is it that only Republicans should come clean, democrats never do?
Obama needs to come clean about Benghazi and his video narrative.
Putin's Puppet a pathological liar. Appears many GOP r complicit in cover up of Russian collusion. Dems need 2 stand 4 USA.
He'll never do that while he is prez.But he will when he does TV special to get attention after his term when he dont matter
NO WAY!treason has no statute of limitation
NAW let him keep being stupid. It's more fun. @realDonaldTrump
@SenSchumer Please explain the release of General Flynn's conversations in Trump Tower
@SenSchumer His balls won't allow that.
@SenSchumer chucks statement "quit the tweets and get to work for American people."He's been trying, u Dems been obstructing
Did Trump ever specify who did the wiretapping?
@bookslutco He does, but he never, ever will.
he won't.
He will apologize, right after David Dukes gives his support for #BLM, and Kellyanne eats a full meal
@SenSchumer he was checking to see if anyone has evidence about TT where a big deal went down? makes sense.
The I guess the @nytimes does to!
@RedAnneBolynn then apologize to President Obama and then resign.
@SenSchumer after you all come clean and admit you made up the Russians!
@Green_Footballs unfortunately, he doesn't need to. He can lie all he wants.
@SenSchumer He "should" but he doesn't "need" to. His needs are be boss, be liked & be accepted. This at any expense even 
People who say things like this do not understand the man in the White House. HE IS A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR.
You DemocRATS need to admit you are making up Russian & Trump collusion. Trump uses Russian salad dressing & you Dems say it's a collusion!
@SenSchumer It took 2 years to admit about the birther claims....
Should @POTUS account be deleted if he continues to post untruths?  It can be "cited/flagged" by millions.
typical leftist, silence those that don't agree with you
You know he never will, not with Malignant narcissistic personality disorder w/ psychopathy
@joshtpm
He can't do that because he BELIEVES IT! Which is possibly even worse than knowingly telling a lie?!
I heard Comey say he couldn't answer the question of if a FISA court issued a warrant on Trump tower and if it was wired
Don't hold your breathe
Senator .@MartinHeinrich .@TeaJunkie1 he does not possess the fortitude nor the integrity required
Senator, please demand a special prosecutor for the Trump Russia link
He makes up so much. Why stop there? @AmazingSOP1
Love is having to say you're sorry . . .
Yes, he is a liar and he needs to admit it.  GOP needs to admit they have enabled him up to now and they need to stop that.
@washingtonpost @thehill @nytimes @AP @KCStar ....> It's not in his DNA to be truthful. trump & Pence should be impeached!
Trump should testify under oath #Trumprussia #ComeyHearing
Trump is giving hysterical Dems & corrupt Intel agencies the rope he needs to hang them with.
Republicans need to come clean and quit backing a man who should never have been nominated.
Trump needs to come clean about a heck of a lot more.  So does Congress.
Like that's ever gonna happen... Wonder if 45's ever admitted lying or being wrong about anything
He needs to do a lot more than that.  Any reason to think he will?  Naaah.
Trump is psychologically incapable of ever coming clean on anything.....once uttered the lie must be defended at all costs
It would be good if he did. Unfortunately, the President seems to believe his own lies. Literally: believes his own lies.
He didn't and you know that.  The demo party is the party that has no integrity and will so ANYTHING to destroy others. Sad.
give him 8 years
@SenSchumer so we can safely say no one should trust the media as clearly all the reports were false.
@SenSchumer It takes a man to admit he is wrong and apologize.  Guess we won't see that happening
@SenSchumer  It was reported in The NY Times, have them retract it
he's too delusional and egotistical to do so.
@joshtpm lol his ego is too big to do that
That's the right thing to do however pathological liars seldom do the right thing
right after the dems can come clean & admit they made up Russian hacking.
I'm not going to hold my breath. I doubt in 70 years he has EVER admitted to being wrong about ANYTHING!!
@SenSchumer
Getting Hot in the Kitchen,! Trump better Get Out. His Credibility is ZERO
and apologize to Pres Obama
He made up nothing. Your shills in the media wrote article after article saying Trump was a wire tap & surveillance target.
Never apologize, never explain.  On to the next conspiracy theory.
How did Flynn's transcript even occur without wiretap?
@joshtpm He'll never do it. When found out, rather than go on defense, he attacks.
@SenSchumer He is a liar and a fraud! Do your jobs and truly hold him accountable. Stop talking and take action!
HAHAHAHAHAHA @realDonaldTrump @POTUS will NEVER apologize/admit wrong doing,he NEVER thinks he's wrong,truly disgraceful
@SenSchumer really, what for? Anyone with any intelligence has known he is a liar and the rest don't care.
@SenSchumer are you ready to admit your lies to the American people on Obama care that you dems planned it be a failure
Didn't make it up...he already cited the New York Times as the source and the article has been pointed out all over.
lol. All he knows how to do is double down.
defamation/libel/slander is still a crime. Why is no one charging him?
@SenSchumer You won't catch a Democrat ever walking back a mistake. And you expect him to, even if a mis-truth?
And then resign.
you don't expect that, do you? How naive
Though we all know he won't. He doesn't know how to apologize.
If you don't believe Obama was using surveillance on Trump you're high and its time to lay off the crack.
He won't. And we KNOW he won't. He'll probably blame someone else. So what do we do about it?
there were some news orgs c reporting it. He may have been the victim of fake news. Better than you calling him a liar!
@SenSchumer He does that and he's out of a job.
You're gonna have to talk to Fox about that...
@Green_Footballs  ...which will happen the day after Paul Ryan offers a proposal for single-payer, universal health care.
When you're delusional, you believe your own lies, so this will never happen. We can only hope he'll tweet himself 2 death!
@SenSchumer Hillary needs to come clean on lying about Benghazi and destroying her own server to protect the illegal actions
one would think you people would work with trump... these must be your agendas and not of the people!
He did not make up claim.  It was in "reputable" MSM news for all to read.
That would involve admitting he was wrong & Obama was right or innocent, and that will never happen in a million lifetimes.
obama is anything but innocent
@SenSchumer nope
@SenSchumer  let's talk about coming clean to the American people! Let's go find Hillary's lap top that she destroyed
the only POTUS in my lifetime to be impeach was clinton & only by the House - for LYING UNDER OATH! Hmmmm
A Democrat telling someone to come clean?
"The involuntary removal of a sitting President of the United States has never occurred in our history" Cornell Law
So you're saying he is becoming a politician like You! Sorry 2 disappoint but @POTUS has 2 major issues 2 do #BuildThatWall & #draintheswamp
@tates5a Nope, this is a guy that ripped people off in his fake university, and when he had to pay 25 million, he gloated
But he's not man enough, so ...
@rosierifka Come clean or face a congressional inquiry. Neither will happen as long as the unpatriotic R's are in control.
As soon as Obama comes clean & admits HE TAPPED EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN & HER ALLIES! & not a moment b4
@SenSchumer never gonna happen! He's too busy getting ready for his rally tonight.
right now, I will guess @BarackObama won't care as long as this Russian Interference with Election proves Trump is invalid.
@SenSchumer and AG Sessions will accept gay marriage too! What a great fairytale ! #Trumprussia
Never happen, Trump needs to know not admitting he's wrong is not the same as being right.
RIIIIIIGHHHTT.....like Hillary came clean with her emails that she illegally and intentionally stored?  We ain't stupid.
Trump NEEDS IMPEACHED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I just repeated what I heard on Fox! They make textbooks right?!"
@SenSchumer It will never happen!
Not gonna happen from a man who said "I didn't say anything. I just quoted [somebody]."
Senator Heinrich, did the NYT make it up?
I feel sorry for anybody who thinks there's even a 1/1 billion chance this would ever happen.
@QHancroft @SansMerci86 He wont because he's a compulsive liar, Narcissist & is corrupt. 
@SenSchumer It sounds to me like you are calling your @POTUS a liar. When the proof is shown, I hope you will apologize!
Oh yeah....good luck with that.
How about when Clinton admits knew Benghazi was attack and did nothing and told daughter was attack, but blamed video!
gee ya think? How many think it will happen..clap loudly so Martin can hear ya..*crickets*
Does that mean the #MSM has to come clean as well???
@SenSchumer He already passed the buck onto @FoxNews
@SenSchumer it's not in his DNA to do the right thing.
He would crumble to dust.
Don't hold your breath.
He must, but Trump is unable to  do that. He can't admit error or apologize.
incredible that this even needs to be said
Not in his DNA to do that
@SenSchumer yeah don't count on it! Trumps method is to lie & refuse to apologize...ever. or admit wrongdoing.
@SenSchumer He won’t. Ever. Apology is not in his lexicon. It’s not in his personal make-up. He’ll deflect to something else
He needs to admit he's in bed with Putin.
Remember when he he took $500,000 from a Moscow Bank for 1 speech?

Oh wait that was Bill Clinton, nevermind.
Not gonna happen. #1 - So not in his nature to accept responsibility. #2 - Impeachable offense, on its face.
How about when Obama admits he knew about IRS and Fast & Furious. Or that he knew Benghazi was attack and let Ambassador die
And break a 70-year streak of never admitting a mistake?  Hell will freeze over first.
@SenSchumer never admit anything especially when your not wrong.  bama ordered to acquire anything on Trump, anyway possible
He Made Up The Wiretapping Claim To Distract The America Ppl From His Lies & Destruction!
How does one investigate another without active surveillance?
With the direct intention to mislead.
Same time Judge in Hawaii admits he's political hack for Obama and that his attorneys wrote decision and quits job.
@SenSchumer He's not man enough.
Potus is busy deflecting attention.
@SenSchumer For that he'd need a conscience. Pretty sure his is missing.
I hate hearing dt referee to a 'president'.Eeerwwww
@joshtpm As Dana HW Carvey would say "no gah da."
@danacarvey
He'll never do that.
Actually...Comey needs to come clean and state there is no difference between physical wiretap and being under surveillance
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! It's funny because that would mean accepting responsibility for his actions.
and apologize to @POTUS44
Good luck! That would be a first in his 70 years of life, not happening.
@Green_Footballs you're dumber than you look if you think @POTUS will ever apologize for anything.
Martin, you should come clean and admit to your ties to Awan brothers & state secrets you may have provided to Media.
He'd rather be right than smart.
#45 LIED and committed LIBEL. I don't want him to "come clean", I want him to be IMPEACHED.
@SenSchumer laughable at best he's pres he's got info and obama did indeed surveil Trump
@SenSchumer Dem's  have to come clean & admit they are making up Russian collusion BS & admit Hillary was crap candidate
Trump is a liar. How much longer are we going to endure this embarrassing, destructive administration? How long?
@SenSchumer he won't. Move on.
@SenSchumer nagahappen
Anyone who's lived in #NYC will tell you: Trump never apologizes or admits fault or blame. Don't hold your breath.
He should also apologize.
Yes he does.
Will never happen. Ever.
