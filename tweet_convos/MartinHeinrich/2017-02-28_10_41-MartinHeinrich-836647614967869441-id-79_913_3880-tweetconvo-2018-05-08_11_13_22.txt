ask Ryan why A fetus has the right to live but I do not have a right to affordable insulin that keeps me alive.
C Obamacare sucks!Repeal&Replace it now.Ucan get a job,a fetus can't. It has the same right to life
I have a job but I need insulin to live and paying 325% more is not possible 4 most Americans .
Well I guess you should move to Cal.or Canada they have no morals there. They think the way you do.
I don't know where U live or your story. But an innocent fetus didn't ask to be made so it's our responsibility to protect them
i did not  ask for type 1 diabetes at age 6 but but screw me & the millions of kids with it.
I can't stop laughing about how furious Cory Booker looks in this photo lmao
LOL. I was about to write that. Arms folded & face scrunched.
"little liberals assholes forcing me to care about my constituents! "
It's gettin' so a neoliberal can't sell out public 4 a measly $35000 check! What's the  comin 2!?
I know it's a lot of money but it a for campaigning, not even going on his pocket.
It's just an awful system. The Clintons & their "New Democrats" went all in with Wall Street...
But people r waking up. When else would a pharma bill b news? That we can have that effect is gr8
@BernProgressive @SenSanders you all know Republicans will quash this bill.
growup Corey
thank you!
@CATS_PAWS @SenSanders like importing pharmaceuticals from a 3rd world country like Canada?
"proud to try & fool you with pharma approval" is what you mean....
I would rather have the CDC give approval, than take an unstudied drug
Insee by this photo that Cory Booker learned from his prior mistake on big pharma.
@djwoolverton @SenSanders does this bill have a reserve fund to pay for it with another bill or you going w pt of order?
Good work. Thanks.
Will Booker be returning his big pharma campaign contributions?  He already voted no on Bernie's bill.
now he's co-sponsored this legislation... times change.  Constituents eyes on Dems & Repubs alike...
Call me shocked.  Did not expect a turn around from him.
now im tracking @PattyMurray & @SenatorCantwell both voted to kill Sen Sanders last Pharma bill
#eyes
Hazard a guess on his change of position?
Recognition that ppl want reps to work for them NOT corporations #resist
@POTUS #healthcare
there should be a ban on corruption & on climate deniers in politics. There's no place for that type of bigotry
@CATS_PAWS @SenSanders why didn't you vote for it the first time? You and @CoreyBooker2020 are just trying to save face.
New Mexico! Land of Enchantment.!
GREAT!!!
make insurers and drug companies compete, and your worries will disappear.
so fda and gov red tape does not already ensure this ???? just worthless
@NomikiKonst @SenSanders

Proud to see the American Senate uses Canada as an example to fix their healthcare.
Thank you!  America needs you more than ever! #BigPharma
good for you sir.  Embrace the people and not the dollars!

13,506 Marines applied for White House Detail last week.  None applied over the last 8 years,  they had to be assigned!....
Aha! This is more like it.

Not Steve Bannon. He's too busy penciling himself into more committees. @MartinHeinrich @SenSanders
Proud of Sen Sanders
Drugs should not be a burden to Americans.  They should be affordable and readily available.
