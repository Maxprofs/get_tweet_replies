So many lies coming from Democrats, it's embarrassing to this country.
I AGREE I'M ALSO FRUSTRATED AND PRAY JESUS .THIS BLOCKING STOPS NOW I'M TIRED AS WELL AS OTHERS
There Are Openings Coming Next Election For the GOP
what about my kids dreams of going to college? Their education suffers because of your DREAMers. AMERICANS FIRST!!! #MAGA
How so?
by spending resources on teaching English instead of algebra, NM ranks in the bottom 1/5 of the nation #MAGA
but u we're talking about ur kids going to college so ur answer makes no sense.
k-12 public schools. How can they GET to college when they're behind before college?
.@MartinHeinrich Not only do I agree with this, I think we also need to have a workable path to citizenship. For DREAMers AND their parents.
Even the fervent Trump supporter I work with agrees with this.
I believe it. If for no other reason, because the economics make sense. Self-interest alone dictates this.
"Self-interest" is one of the defining characteristics of my co-worker, so yeah.
why don't you try to improve NM schools?Get the DREAMers out so American kids get a better education.Let DREAM do it legally
Dude. You dont get anywhere by dreaming
@SenSchumer Legal immigration  illegal 
How many are on welfare? How much have they cost taxpayers?
@SenateDems
@SenSchumer EVERYONE that is here ILLEGALLY should be deported.  It's the LAW.  Ever heard of that?
@SenSchumer if only you cared for legal citizens as much as you do the dreamers we all would be living the dream #NuffSaid
Most of them r dreaming alright but not of being American, rather what they can get from America!
We owe them NOTHING!
everyone in the country ilegally should be targeted, period. end of story. You are unamerican
@ProgressNowNM  dreamers are illegal also due to Democrats and some Republicans selective idea of law enforcement .
@SenSchumer they can't be dreamers forever! It's time they get their shit together and become citizens or get out...
@SenSchumer DACA should b rescinded. Then we have DACA females having babies. Who pays? Taxpayers! Deport all illegals.
@SenSchumer
@SenSchumer dreamers is the nice way to say illegal immigrant. Aren't they all dreamers?
DON'T ATTACK DREAMERS. YOU MEAN IN OTHER WORDS LIBERAL SNOWFLAKES.
@SenSchumer if a person is not here LEGALLY, then DEPORT.  Why do you and these otheres think they are above the law??
@SenSchumer change their name to whatever you want, still illegal.
What part of ILLEGAL dont you understand..Look up the meaning
What about Americans kids? So let's put illegals before our own Americans kids? You make me sick.
They should not be targeting ANYONE! This is not a dictatorship (yet).
He didn't stop DACA. Who are dreamers? Anyone that want's to stroll across our border?
Stop Lying Martin.  Trump supports Dreamers, where's your proof...
ILLEGALS
@SenSchumer STOP LYING TO AMERICAN PPL!!! THAT'S NOT WHATS HAPPENING & YOU KNO IT!! SICK OF IMMATURE NASTY LYING POLITICIANS
If they're illegal, send them home.
should also target senators who protect illegals in our country
@SenSchumer follow the law.
@SenSchumer  What about the LAW Senator? U have duty 2follow the Constitution & DACA is unconstitutional. What say u 2 that?
@SenSchumer Is Chuck responsible for the wiretapping?
@SenSchumer AWWW SCHUMER INCORPORATED IS TRYING TO MAKE EVERYBODY JUST JEALOUS OF OUR TRUMP
send them out of here ILLEGAL..RESIGN if you cannt follow the law
if they have a criminal history then this is ok?
@Mrs_Grayeyes it's a side show ppl.His rhetoric is an excuse to hide taxes and Russian contacts.He has debt they have videos
Just because you call something by a different name doesn't make it different than what it is! ILLEGAL immigrant
@SenSchumer RT if the dems need to get over losing to Trump .
RT if u voted for a dude in bed with Russia.
haha trying to protect people who broke the law. Gtfo
How long do you dream. Become a freaking citizen just another complacent avenue for illegal immigrants #stopdreaming wake up and apply #MAGA
target them, target the shit out if them and then when they are back home show them how to file for citizenship
@SenSchumer I want dreamers to stay. I WANT SANCTUARY CITIES GONE! Dreamers don't need them. Criminals do!
@SenateDems And children of law abiding citizens? They don't have dreams nor any rights?
@SenSchumer Any invader is up for grabs.
@SenSchumer @ClydeRabideau Tanveer Hussain
BUILD THE WALL. A sovereign nation must protect it's borders. Support POTUS agenda!
@SenSchumer what if they break the law?
WRONG.. YOU PAY FOR THEM WE ARE TIRED OF IT!! Send them back to Mexico. Let them make Mexico great again USA 1st
@BluMoody17 #resist & persist
The Trump administration should do what Obama would not do...enforce the law!!! Illegal aliens broke the law
NOT FINE. IT KILLS MILLIONS. Ask Mothers Against Drunk Drivers. But hell, you dem-mafia don't care about people
NOT if they break ANY law. DUI is a bad law. Look at what happened in New Orleans. I know many think its fine
Giving them a pretty name does not remove the criminal or expiration status freedom from documentation.  
@SenateDems ummm he's NOT.
@SenSchumer to the point where I kind of want dems to let him engage in trade wars, mass deportations, & Obamacare repeal
then we can see the disaster such policies are and the GOP collapses. And we have moderate lawmakers again.
@SenSchumer When will American children be allowed to dream again?
@SenSchumer Oh but look how Mexico deals with ILLEGALS then tell me we're wrong.Mexivo puts them in jail.
- Hey Martin/ Schumer.....You two getting all these tweets? Are you getting the 'real' picture?  @POTUS
@SenSchumer Y would I retweet this, It should be easier for American citizens to go to school here for free than an illegal
Americans should PAY for the DemParty replacing their AbortedVoterBase? #ElectionsHaveConsequences~DEPORT! #MAGA
FBI should be investigating @SenSchumer @POTUS44 @HillaryClinton no way a wire tap can be left active if nothing found except political
You should encourage citizen's to sponsor an illegal and help them become American citizens
@SenSchumer he should be targeting Chucky, Pelosi, and other career politicians!
Deport them all.
It is beyond cruel to target dreamers!
@SenSchumer Dreamers?   You mean children of illegal immigrants right?   Does the word illegal mean anything to Democrats?
DREAMERS  deserve a chance. US is all they know. Stand strong.
@SenSchumer you should really pray for our leaders and drop the dreamer bit
they have the American dream, selling drugs to small children 
@SenSchumer what about the kids in Chicago are you going to put them first
@SenSchumer you mean illegals? People who are in our country illegally? As in, not legal, against  the law?
@SenSchumer @ANTONIO47MEX should they protect a child molester that got a Visa? 
@SenSchumer big 4,000 retweets. Your killing it. Lol
@SenSchumer deport them all. Illegal means illegal
Agree, they should target Dreamers & their parents. Send them all back to wherever they came from "illegally"
@SenSchumer  if there in a Gang by Felicia. Martin you suck 
The trump administration needs to go. All except the Military Leaders.
trump is a vengeful old white man. He will continue to attack immigrants because he can.
If they don't have the appropriate documentation, applications, they should be deported the same as every other illegal.
@SenSchumer how about you stand up to respect our veterans and their families first?

Thanks, sir. We must stop this cruel treatment of human beings. It is immoral.
@SenSchumer like the athlete dreamer that #Chuckschumer got a visa for that molested a 12 year old boy as soon as he arrived
@SenSchumer They are not " targeting" dreamers. If those dreamers r gang members or did not renew status, that stinks.
Americans 1st!  Americans 1st!  Americans 1st!  Americans 1st!.....oh, you're a Democrat, and you don't think that Americans come 1st....
Dude should be impeached, get to the root of the problems here. Former Republican:
@SenSchumer if or dream is to get Raped Chuck will make sure that happens. Right @SenSchumer?
@SenSchumer Tell the story about the young girl who was raped by a man Chucky went to bat for so he could play a game. #Rape
@SenSchumer RT if you think these foolish Dems are wasting OUR TAXPAYER $$ over a witch hunt!
He should deport anyone with an expired Visa period. No exceptions. Get rid of ALL lawbreakers.
@SenSchumer he is just enforcing the law and ensuring America stays safe do it legal. Try getting into Canada with felony.
@SenSchumer if they want to come to the US why can't they do it legally. If I as a US citizen stole SSN I would be in prison
@cmsrnlmt UMustBeAnotherGettingPaid2importIllegalsCriminals&AntiAmericansI'dBet&I'dWin.CommonSenseWins2.SoonerOrLater.
@SenateDems WE WIN! WE WIN! WE WIN!! America has been rescued!!! GOD WON!!!
@SenateDems -   is #dreamers another synonym for #illegals
@SenateDems Can you say #ruleOfLaw ?
@SenSchumer they AREN'T targeting dreamers. When you make a post like this making it sound factual people believe your BS
we should be enforcing the law. Illegal immigrants are subject to deportation.
NO!
No, Break the Law- go to jail - Break into America = GET DEPORTED!
@SenSchumer and we must stop for profit detention
@senschumer hey did you hear about athlete schumer pulled strings to keep in jail statutory rape 12 yr old
@SenSchumer  anyone here illegal broke law send them home. If i break law will you defend me? Assholess
@SenSchumer if they are illegal they broke our law, why arebyou trying to usurp our laws? You libs started this, now own it
Good God Senator. Do you even follow your own tweets to see what people are saying? If you did you would probably clam-up.
@SenSchumer
@SenSchumer they took my job, throw them out now.
@SenSchumer no he should NOT be,but @realDonaldTrump is a heartless/gutless/spineless coward who has no morals/credibility
@SenSchumer Or their Abuelas
Jesus H Christ.  Seriously.  Invoke the 25th Amendment. #wiretapped
true just focus on targeting the Democratic Party!
@SenSchumer Do you agree that Chuck shouldn't have pulled strings for Tanveer Hussain to come here to sexually assault a kid
@SenSchumer their parents broke the law...they need to return as a family to their legal country.
R they Illegal and R they working on getting US citizenship. ThereR alot of ???????'s Americans want answered.
@SenSchumer Did you apologize yet to the family of the 12 yr old girl SEXUALLY ASSAULTED by Muslim you let into country? Big Mistake
@SenateDems The Administration itself should not be. Enough of this!
Please Impeach this man child pretending to be President!!! HE HAS MADE A MOCKERY OUT OF OUR DEMOCRACY!
Are you a UNITED STATES senator or a representative from Mexico? Who elected you? Who do you serve?
Its not "targeting" them to simply enforce the law.  Every dollar we provide to illegal aliens means one less dollar to us.
no he should target corrupted politicians like Shmuck Schumer
@SenSchumer they can dream all they want once they are coming in legally.
I agree Dreamers are here to stay and 45 is vile for hating immigrants at all haters come from immigrants too check yourself
@SenSchumer  Of course, they shouldn't target Dreamers!
@SenSchumer get em out!!
