Rofl, your whole moto is resist. Move along skippy.
it's called the 1st amendment. Ever hear of it?
Yes, you do know it applies to all people no.
LOL
U had an opportunity to endorse POTUS' unifying gestures; instead you perpetuate divisiveness through tweets. Shame shame
do not let the Russian investigation die and keep demanding for his tax release
@SenateDems  He most certainly did!  Get your head out of your ass. You are all a bunch of HYPROCRITES !! #MAGA #deportation
@SenateDems he will never be able to do this... too many dont trust him. stop waiting for pigs to fly
@SenateDems if that speech didn't make you motivated then CLEARLY the problem is NOT THE POTUS!! Get onboard or get out!
That's do stupid.  Yeah let's just follow him like the lambs to the slaughter.  Use ur brain.
Clearly he is trying to get some work done and the Dems are behaving like infants.  I didn't vote for you to NOT do your job
were you not able to understand the language or the definitions of the words.
What in the hell is wrong with you Senator? What have you done lately that would promote unity??? These childish tweets?????
Are you deaf, and blind? Sit on sideline and criticize. Doing nothing.
2018
you are clearly out of touch.
Clearly it doesn't matter how sincere he is or what he says, the @SenateDems will still act like two year olds.
Correction. YOU had the opportunity to follow his lead of uniting the country, if even for a moment, and you refused. Sad.
You must have been watching a different speech
@SenateDems You can't unite when the opposition Democrats have their fingers in their ears so they can't hear
More lies
@javiermgonzales Yeah ....he really shouldn't have forced the Dems 2 dress in white &not applaud for jobs etc..
Trump divided us, demonizing everyone who does not agree with him. He is a diminisher, not a unifier.
@SenateDems clearly sticking your fingers in your ears & saying to yourself, "I'm not listening" still works aka gradeschool
How sad you sill are going to keep this war on conservatives going. What do you hope to gain?Watched in Germany-BBC loved it
The Trump Trolls are out in force tonight.  Hail Putin!!!
Did you hear? Putin hacked the Oscars too! #tinfoilhat
feel better now? The only diff is actual proof by all our intelligence agencies v an accounting error #tryagain
Bwahaha. #tinfoilhat #obamabirthcertificate #bigfoot #unicornsarereal
@SenateDems he did, other than the democrates  who are  new communist party against American people,  soros and obama agenda
Clearly he did. Martin, you need help buddy.
change your tune if you want to be relevant.
Were you part of the Demo contingency to rudely leave b4 the president did? If so, you weren't listening anyway.
hes definately blind/Def
@SenateDems Clearly he does not want to.
We all know what he likes to seize ...
He only knows how to divide.

@colbert_ed Because it's all about him.  And no one trusts the liar.
No Marty U are WRONG again. I think you were like all of the other dressed in white sucking your thumb. He tried Umissed it
If this was not accomplished it was not his fault.
stop playing partisan politics long enough to listen to the people you represent
You had an opportunity to unite both parties tonight. Clearly you failed.
We're obviously not united. You could help change that. It's not 1 mans job, do yours. Live under the laws you make!!
DEMs had an opportunity to shine tonight...and they TOTALLY blew it!! Who was in charge of the DEM response? Horrible!
I didn't listen to the speech, but you need to do your job, not resist everything!
I read all your tweets & realize 45 has conned you & you haven't caught on. Ryan's healthcare bill is not what you think.
Referring to his supporters as "the rebellion" is totally unifying. #sarcasm
you cannot spend more than you take in. You cannot make the cuts to agencies that are needed daily. Our military is bigger.
45 is still the same man. No amount of speeches will change his autocratic rule. His economic plan is not feasible.
You have all forgotten how his campaign started. His continual lies, Russian ties, conflicts of interest, racist remarks
he has no interest in unifying the country. He's a giant narcissist with zero interest in compromise.
@SenateDems because you don't want it. Shame
@javiermgonzales what speech were you watching? #haters
@SenateDems open your ears, support your President. Better listen to speech again. Repeal failed Obama Care!!!
@SenateDems Are you delusional Sir, you are wrong and you will be proven wrong, keep chasing those straws right off a cliff
His idea of unifying the country is for the rest of us to betray our principles & go along with him. Won't happen.
@SenateDems What the heck were you watching?  #SelectiveHearingProblem
@JohnGla94676241 his hands are too small to seize anything
@SenateDems I'm not a politician but im pretty sure he talked directly about working together multiple times
@SenateDems That's because you won't give him a chance. I know now why none of the dems stood, to busy writing their hate.
And what is your definition of "unifying" the country?
@SenateDems U must have been asleep. Ur delusional.
Trump knocked it out of the park! #MAGA Great speach
@SenateDems Were we watching the same speech or did you just have an aneurysm when he took the podium as The President?
he had no opportunity to unite - we will not stand for bigotry misogyny racism stop speaking like a politician Martin
At least he wasn't unhinged. Wait until he gets to his Twitter phone, then we'll get the real #POTUS back  #JointAddress
@JoeMyGod  not a trump fan or even close, but there was absolutely nothing he could say to bring this country together.
many lost opportunities; same , empty promises w/o real action plans.  We need healing, proof we all have place. Pretty tie
I sure hope that was sarcasm because he never intended to.  Impeach Trump Now!
What Trump did to Democratic governors earlier in the week was unconscionable.
The Hill reported that both dem and rep govs found out about press conference after it was over.
@BillySpillwater Quick, tell@CNN @VanJones68
oh no he seized it - U Dems just don't care enough about the American ppl 2 meet him half way! We're on 2 U! 
@SenateDems MY PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS GIVEN AMERICA HOPE AGAIN!
@SenateDems Clearly the old white retired Democrat spokesman represents the vitality of your Party. Inertia is w/Republicans
@SenateDems does anybody seriously believe this @POTUS gives a damn about unifying America? #Trumprussia #Impeach45
Hey this President has productive loving children. Speaks highly for him
@SenateDems you can not unify the Demoncrat hatred for this country & people who didn't vote for you. You lost
@SenateDems are you so hardheaded that you failed to listen in? typical politician.
@SenateDems Compared to past presidents he seized it!
@SenateDems Unity is defiantly NOT on his agenda. Believe me.
@SenateDems sucks when ya lose - doesn't it?
@SenateDems - hey guy, you got a comprehension problem !
I will have what you're smoking ;)
@SenateDems he has no intention on ever unifying anything...
Oh Yes He Does....a white supremacy movement for the ultra rich! Hence his cabinet.
@SenateDems 
Kinda tough against Dems who lie, thrive on divisiveness and clearly favor immigrants over Americans
@SenateGOP  @PRyan @POTUS Are you related to Rhinehard Heinrich the WWII Nazi Killer...just wondering
@SenateDems Wow just wow. It was a historic, patriotic speech and you fools dismiss it because you are so partisan
why not? Sour grapes?
#Democrats that are still having temper tantrums are difficult to work with! Your party is pathetic.
@SenateDems ummmm.... because you listening to the same thing I was because he did extend an olive branch to the Democrats.
I think he really wasted this great opportunity to said very important things. Instead he kept talking about sand castles.
I'm not surprised.  I'm not fooled. Trump will not change the country for the good.
Oh yes he did.  Mr. Party of no.
@SenateDems 
What speech were you watching? Believe in yourself my fellow American.

What, you missed that?
@SenateDems Pres Trump tried to unify but Dems were sitting down like donkeys in the middle of the road not giving an inch.
He extended the olive branch, you are choosing to reject it.
@SenateDems he never will. Give up hope and investigate #Trumprussia #russiagate now! 45 most corrupt president EVER!
collaborated but there's nothing there you PPL just go on & on u Cnt even make a...
.... specific accusation & just obstruct thats y u lose
Because he has no real interest in doing such.
@SenateDems not too smart there Martin.
