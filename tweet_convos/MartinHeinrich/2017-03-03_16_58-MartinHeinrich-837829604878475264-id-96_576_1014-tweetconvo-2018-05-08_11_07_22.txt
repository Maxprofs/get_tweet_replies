@CoryBooker how payed for the skills and training? I work my ass off to save for college for my kids and you give it away!
@CoryBooker oh well
the failure of the United States to protect the border allowed for Dreamers to exist. The only solution is citizenship
Democrats have not done enough to make this an issue. Border control and then amnesty. Get it done
@CoryBooker We also dream. Of politicians that care for Americans as much as they care about people who break our laws.
Not only DREAMers, their families too. Undoc immigrants spend a LOT of money in their communities! Not all Bad!
@CoryBooker how? Do they have social security cards issued by the government? Do they pay for school? Where do u get info
@CoryBooker your saying it's ok for them to be breaking the law?  They are undocumented-here illegally.
$0 because undocumented people actually can't receive those benefits.
bang out some proof. Our numbers show that the immigrants are the #1 cause of TRILLIONS. Back up ur words.
it is not moral 2 banish people to a country foreign to them.
@CoryBooker that's 2% of our yearly GDP. Come here legally and be a part of the 98% of us who do it right.
amen to that
what about THE LAW?! Does not matter how much they bring in or contribute to! They R illegally here Stupid left wing son!
not the right argument. Dreamers have naturalized here due to no fault of their own. They're American as u and me.
@oreillyfactor  Cory We See You Are Too QuietSo It Must MeanYour Failed 8 year Boy Has Stepped In It  SO Corrupt
Including thethey contribute to SS that they can never claim. Love how the GOP leaves that detail out.
And how much did it cost the taxpayers in benefits while they were growing up.
@CoryBooker so true.
they take OUR JOBS! fool! America FIRST!
And last year they cost CA alone $25B. Google it Senator. I'm getting tried of correcting you.
Senator, which laws should we enforce and which law should we not enforce???????
@CoryBooker Old man Trump has taken "get off my lawn" to a whole new level with his immigration plans. @JoyAnnReid @maddow
Lets get 'em the hell out of here as fast as possible. Why a U.S Senator would enforce breaking the law is beyond me.
@CoryBooker deport all illegal aliens it's the law
@CoryBooker explain please
@CoryBooker . And how much tax dollars goes on welfare for the parents of these dreamers?
you speak more abt protecting illegals than protecting and upholding our #constitution
You are not looking out for your constituents. Serve the ppl who voted for u.
This research is like big tobacco research showing cigarettes are safe!
Correction*  show research that's not done by a HIGHLY BIASED source
Johnny in projects got dreams too, he cant contribute cause he does not have a job  you gave it away, Johnny will remember when he votes
No matter how you lie or make up figures you are full of BS!  Ship em out and then let them get to the back of the line
@CoryBooker  This is Putin's Political Coup to Destroy the U.S. TRUMP, BANNON & the GOP R his WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION!
I'm soooooooo sick of wages going down, n rent going up.  Let's drop this pro immagrant retarded argument, OK?
U increase legal immigration 2 replace them. 
Legal immigrants get protection by min wage laws you  so much

Illegals don't! 
 Misleading
So $43 billion a year in a 18063 billion (2015) economy. That's a contribution of 0.23%. PEANUTS!
@CoryBooker by my calc, this article is saying that each will contribute ~$58,489/yr to the GDP over the next 10 yrs. 
Guessworkvand BS
You insult the intelligence of the majority of American People who understand when they are being lied to for politics...
...liberal logic, pathetic...
@CoryBooker grEat....buT can america wAnts cromitE...if wAnt thEn plS contEct mE...Our crOmite goinG to chinA.pls contect me
@CoryBooker ...and give more jobs to American citizens who would then contribute to the economy..
@CoryBooker stop making stuff up there is plenty of legal Americans who can use some free college and jobs
@CoryBooker I could care less about how DACA affects the economy. I care that DACA helped lives and provided an opportunity.
The Octomoms will restock the country for us!
@CoryBooker BULL S....  get them out. Do without them better than with!!
@CoryBooker 
I am saddened by how many believe the lies.

Hope they enjoy $75 salads...do they eat salad? Most foods?
@CoryBooker Where can I find these facts?
The Truth About Immigration and Welfare
Last 2 yrs NC dreamers decided they want more than free pub school edu citizens gave them & are brazen enough 2 protest 4..
...in-state tuition & eligibility 4 federal college grants. SInce 2013, NC has grappled w/a 14.5% pub school teacher...2/
and their big crime in life is being born a few months too soon.
Dreamers add to our economy. They go off to serve in our armed forces, they are the next wave of employees in our businesses
the food we eat is harvested by immigrants they plant, weed, irrigate. Farmers could not do it all without them.
the other side of the coin is they just don't want to buy new machines to harvest correctly cheap bastards
Thank you!  
I hate that we have to define POC and immigrants in terms of their value to capital tho
With $20 TRILLION of US debt thanx to #Obama & #Democrats, we citizens/taxpayers are compelled to think that way.
The economic part needs to be circulated via MsM. Most people don't understand the economic consequences.
Dreamers do not contribute anywhere near the amount they require in gov funds. NO ILLEGALS
enforce the law that was created to keep our great country safe from foreign invaders
you know what I dream of I dream of a day when people actually think about the posterity and safety of their country and
@AntonioArellano the immigrants that will be deported contribute to the economy too . Lest bring everybody out . Legal way !
...wouldn't be a problem if the criminals (illegals) came here as legal citizens...
maybe dems should donate to illegals what part of ILLEGAL CROSSING ANOTHER COUNTRY ..?? Victims of illegals memorials
ILLEGALS CONTRIBUTE BY TAKING OUR JOBS..BECOME A LEGAL AMERICAN.OUR AMERICAN DREAM FOR US GONE..AMERICANS IMPOVERISHED
@Gwydion620 GOP refuses to believe ALL contributions made by hard working immigrants.
..hard working legal immigrants, absolutely. criminals (illegals) not so much...
The Implementation Of Donald's stand on, IMMIGRATION REFORM. DACA And DAPA.  WILL HAVE A DEVASTATING RESULT TO OUR ECONOMY.
illegals cost tax payers 119 BILLION A YEAR . Let that sink in.
We could easily replace them all with legal immigrants and increase the GDP by much more without all the costs of illegals.
stop being a puppet for the DNC and actually try to help your constituents!
how do they drain resources! ?
The source says it all: "progress" and org.
Ya,  not a fan.  They drain more then we gain.
Thank you Senator Heinrich.
my American-born children have DREAMS too. Why don't you work for THEIR future?
