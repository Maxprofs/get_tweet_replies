Susan, if he ignored disclosure, is that considered a false statement under Sec. 1001?
Technically, lying on the SF86 violates 1001, but I am not aware of any actual criminal prosecutions for it.
Does the President have to look fill out an SF-86?
No, "constitutional officers" (POTUS, VP, Members of Congress, Supreme Court Justices) don't need a clearance.
How about Ivanka in Azerbaijan? 
Lock her up! Lock her up!
.@Susan_Hennessey have you seen this letter that @SenatorTester wrote on Flynn's background check? http://www.tester.senate.gov/files/Letters/2017-03-01%20Letter%20to%20OMB%20OPM%20ODNI%20re%20Security%20Clearances.pdf …
@20committee @Susan_Hennessey @SenatorTester
or anyone else we like or who pays us or Putin tells us to pick
@MartinHeinrich  The biggest liar in the history of the US just left office. You didn't have the balls to call him on it.
I think you've misunderstood the "streamline" Trump administration. No ethics training. No vetting. No SF-86.
2/ Trump now has to explain WHY they skiped these steps. He is the Pres. after all. His admin
Question is: Who's going to MAKE him?
Tooo true. I'm still thinking like Honorable Members of Majority Congress. Idiot me.
Not idiot, never think it. Adjusting. Keep resisting. We're hanging in.
Excellent question.
#donthecon does @realDonaldTrump
@fwdcrocblu this must be investigated
One has to wonder if he even truthfully filled out the form. Disturbing, considering it wouldn't have been his first one.
All of them
The Republicans could be doing something about this. They're content watching our republic burn to the ground. Devastating.
@igob4u2 @Susan_Hennessey This feels like the fall of our country, our beliefs, our self respect & all who respected us.
after the election, it turned into silent coup with spoil system.
Trump
@ssconetwothree1 Most of them, including his family, and himself more then anyone
Iwould say all the "kids" know way too much already/this alone is a football field size RED FLAG! #resist
@20committee Is it true a President can ignore recommendations and grant security clearance?
paedo pence, ryan, mcdonnell?
@SuzyHobbsBaker What about all the Muslim fanatics who held hi level security clearance in Hussein Obama's Admin?
Corrupt people in corrupt administrtratipn
.@Susan_Hennessey @20committee I will bet @jaredkushner wasn't vetted properly. #45 prob said 'trust me, he has no foreign deals'. 
@20committee Bet you most have not been fully vetted! Look at list of ppl hired to work in Agencies. Massage therapist DOE
Not sure Jared Kushner could clear the  the SF-86 - just for starters. Bannon as well. @Susan_Hennessey @Kempo50
Do Bannon and Miller even have clearances? Who can find out? And what can be done if they haven't?
This is Human Resources back ground checks 101, unless they graduated from Trump University.
oh, (raising my hand, then hands, and waving), everyone.
why is Flynn getting off so easy? Pg 2 of SF86 - Penalties...
Yep and a trip to the DB at Ft Leavenworth!
Sebastian Gorka certainly needs careful examination !

a Senator asked Comey to receive Flynn's sf86 the other day, has it been made available?
@MartinHeinrich oh my  it's everyone, it's like a giant conspiracy, they are all KGB sent by Putin, get a grip.
BETTER WORK FAST. TRUMP TAKING OUT THE TRASH.QUIT BEFORE YOU GET FIRED. TRUMP WILL MAKE EVERYTHING CLASSIFIED HA HA
@MattAsherS my vote is Bannon, Miller, Priebus, Spicer
Trump
Likely his clearance was still active from his time as DIA Director, so he didn't need new SF-86. Still should've reported
All of them...lets make a deal!
@amjoyshow  Trump &his cabal R paranoid bc their mental health is poor.They are unhinged,unstable & batshit crazy.
@ezlusztig The top foreign agent trump ok'd it
LOOK INTO THIS GUY PLEASE. Does he have TS clearance?
he blocked us for a reason...doesn't want to be looked into
@ezlusztig We have multiple levels of blatant ignorance of security clearance procedures, they are cowboys running wild
, good point. Chances are it's systemic. @ezlusztig
@ezlusztig   

anybody else would be spending long days on a lie detector
@nycsouthpaw The shorter list would be who doesn't.
@realDonaldTrump himself
About a dozen individuals come to mind who could be the focus of inquiry.
besides @POTUS?
@PRETTYGIRLGG11 almost everyone Donald JUDAS Trump is selling out America to the Kremlin 
#Putin'spuppet
All of the above...heck, it was a listed as a prerequisite...those without conflicts of interest need not apply!!
I think that might be a good question 2 ask Spicer. Did Flynn give truthful answers if so, why hired (Among other things)
@20committee Steve Bannon?
That would be one Donald J Trump.
Tiffany?  Sorry, it's Saturday so needed a laugh.  Sure there are many members privy to info on foreign payrolls
trump. Bannon
It's 7:43 am on Sat. Even with my coffee, am I really ready for a steady stream of fucked-up-ed-ness & resulting outrage?
@JonathanLanday that whole administration is a living breathing red flag.
@SheridanFinAid probably all
@SaraJaneMaki That the 100,000 dollar question! We all want answer's. It's our right to know!
my understanding was he never filled form out. Which is worrisome. Neither did other long time advisors
@crewcrw @normeisen @tribelaw 
@mattmfm @Carter_PE @Khanoisseur  @christogrozev 
@jaketapper
The talking about extreme vetting for people coming to this country when we can't vet our own people to work in the W House
@SaraJaneMaki Trump would be 1
@20committee does this prove we live in a banana republic now?That's funny,I don't remember moving..
#resist #TheResistance
Or think just how bad the people who didn't make the cut were...
and if the answers were incomplete or false, as suggested by WH denial of all knowledge, who is investigating? Sessions?
Is there anyone in Trump's admin that does not have the obvious red flags?
NOT so 'extreme vetting' after all.
@missb62 Well yeah...but the emails!
@20committee Ummm....Donald Trump
all of them. Come on now. If this was a democrat none would have been appointed.
We could count, but it's easier to say ALL OF THEM!
@VinnyTimEC all of them
@chuckburke13 Tillerson
That's been my issue all along. And what happened when Trump himself was supposed to be vetted??
I'm particularly concerned @ Gorka. ForeignPolicy has article re him, they cd not confirm he has sec clrnce
@kharyp This.
@boris3324 Does the question include Russians,FSB,ex-KGB,non Russians,anti-govt Americans,+complete whack jobs?
that would b #stephenbannon (Yogurt) & ReinceARoni Priebus
let's start with the obvious manafore,page,bannon
Bannon and Miller has to be somewhere in the steaming pile...
What about @POTUS himself??? No one knows who he's beholding to (no taxes), & he gets T. Secret of course.
Not sure he could OBTAIN T.S. security clearance, were he not the president. He'd fail, I believe.
all of them...
and how come neither Ryan or McConnell express any concern?
@chuckburke13  Do u remember when dt said Flynn would be his..whatever? He said Flynn didn't need vetting for position!
Spicer repeated the same, but "private citizens" generally don't have access to classified info.
If truth be told,Trump shouldn't even have a TSI clearance due to so many bankruptcies&TrumpU fraud lawsuit! But, he's Pres
trump, for one
How the Hell did Trump get in!
Is there any way to find out who has secret clearance? Or is it a secret?
#TrumpRussia #TaxReturns #resist #conflicts
@moira Sessions, for one. Tillerson, for two. Gimme a second. I'm sure I'll think of more. Oh right! TRUMP.
.@Susan_Hennessey also the pres can deem anyone to have a NTK especially his  ntln sec advisor. Who knows when he last filled out an 86
.@Susan_Hennessey retired generals do not fill one out. Neither does pres, congress etc
@20committee Trump.
@PaulaDeVirginia Susan today jobs numbers came out, trump did a 180 and said now the numbers are legit press laughed.Doomed
Is there a link between Flynn and Tillerson? Could it be Rbt McFarlane? ING/oil link with Tillerson.Mentor of Flynn

Pence says he didn't know about Flynn's lobbying work for Turkey. Rep. Cummings sent him a letter about it in Nov http://read.bi/2nmsgge  
@20committee sue them into compliance.
I mean did he just lie on it? Or was he truthful and no one said anything?
@20committee Yes! This!
exactly!  #trumprussia moles throughout WW
I'm guessing, all.
I had to answer these questions to write software for a fishery contractor for USF&W. This should be taken more seriously.
Who else!? Trump!
Wilbur Ross?
Was Tillerson's SF-86 missing the "Foreign Contacts" section? He received an award from Putin.
@20committee this is disgraceful for any officer but in a former DIA?
My guess is they all got their security clearances in a lucky packet.
FBI agents arrived at WH and escorted a handful of new emp because they failed background checks !
everybody?
All of them, Katie.
#WhoTheFuckIsInCharge
@MattAsherS @Rosie @seanhannity I bet they all have some conflict of interest , and I'm sure there is lots of overlooking
https://ourpublicservice.org/publications/download.php?id=845 … This says appointee inv.'s adjudicated by FBI "SIGBIU." Maybe Comey has answers to SF-86 questions?
@20committee As National Security Advisor, was Flynn exempt from SF-86?
Ummm... Everyone? Just guessing here.
and won't sign ethics pleges?
how would they be granted the clearances with the red flags? Bannon should not have been granted one either.
@ZerlinaMaxwell bigger questions is why would he bother filing now? Obviously these people are trying to cover their tracks
@CherokeeNative3 We may Never know unless 
#INVESTAGATETRUMPRUSSIATIES #INDEPENDENTCOMMISSION SOON
#Resist #TrumpRussia #RussiaGate #TrumpTaxReturns #tRUMP
Good question, who's got the answers
.@Susan_Hennessey .@Trumpnado2016 The SF-86 security form requires detailed information for every foreign contact, 100s of pages for Flynn.
@thegrugq If any of them even filled it out?
Are you exempt from the 5 year ban on lobbying if you are already a lobbyist when you join the administration?
No. 1 Kushner  ($4B in debt to Russians), then Ivanka (BFF, Wendy Deng Putin's GF),  Pence knows all, Gorka, Bannon
Kushner just bought the Watchtower property in Brooklyn for 1 Billion. He's got it somewhere. Daddy. His.
All of those fraudulent criminals.
@20committee can we ask to see everyone's paperwork? Especially the top dogs...
@20committee Well, Sonald Trump for one.
#resist #SoCalledPresident #russiagate
@20committee they need to answer to the ppl re these forms. Like stat. Can FBI do anything??
No 1 is doing anything about any of this. We need some progress or burnout will happen. #SpecialProsecutor for #Trumprussia
Gonna go out on a limb and say, uhhh Stephen K. Bannon?
/ China would know.
Very good point. Security clearances are updated every 10 years for secret and 5 for Top secret...
@20committee Bannon?
@20committee maybe Darth Brannon ?
@20committee I Bannon, his real boss, Tillerson, Sessions, the list goes on.
@20committee Senator Sessions?
@20committee
Probably about as many or fewer than in O's administration.
the President?

I mean if he has a security clearance...
Not to mention those who do not have clearance (Gorka).
You asked "Who else...?" I know that answer! Call on me! It is that guy Donald Trump.
All of them. They are deep in w/Putin.
No wonder first thing on Trump's agenda was asking for top secret clearance for all his closest family & pals 
@MartinHeinrich where was all the cocern with the last Administration and the Muslim Brotherhood? Go away
All of them, Katy
You mean besides Trump himself?
Is is that he did not fill out this form or that he lied on it? If they skipped it, then resp is back on Prez 2 answer why
@GOP @SpeakerRyan @leadermitch All this and more needs INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION. VOTE against GOP 2018!
.@Susan_Hennessey Everyone? There's a saying in the old country: "The fish stinks from the head."
Double dog down on that from me.
the Professional
When did foreign contacts turn into disqualifications?
Bannon, Miller,
This is formatted like no version of the SF86 I've ever seen.  What is this?
This is what the online version looks like, at least through the provider I filled it out with last year.
Ah ok thanks.
Funny how the Obama appointees were the ones reviewing the questionnaire. Their duty to report issues.
Do we know what his answers were on the form?
Donald Trump. Maybe Presidents should have to submit a SF86 and polygraph.
Polygraphs are for the ruled, not the rulers.
This is true, sadly.
@LouiseMensch valid point
All of them.
man, ain't that the question
Ummm. The president himself
#Flynn  We're seeing a standard for plausible deniability which is beyond comprehension...Didn't tell/Didn't ask/Don't care
@SenSchumer @SenWarren @amjoyshow @hardball @NBCNews @JoyAnnReid ALL THIS MESS WITH CONSTANT CONFLICTS..LIES.IS INSANITY!!
@LouiseMensch  Or is it somebody in Congress which I am NOT RULING OUT ... this has gotten so entangled #lookdeeper
Does he have to fill out a new one or should the one from his army days should still be valid? He never lost clearance
no. his military one should have not transfered over. He should have completed a new SF86 as a civilian.
When I watch the news I feel like I'm watching a really bad spy movie.  Time to write my Congressman and Senators again.
Call your congressional reps & senators, don't write. Calling gets their attention way better. Letters ignored.
let's operate on the reality that ALL of them are. if they ignored for him, they ignored for EVERYBODY...
Um, all of them?
I mean, the president himself literally *wears* a long red flag (around his neck). Talk about obvious.
The Gorkas
you are assuming he didn't lie in his answers. He is going to jail.
every last one of them
BINGO!!!!
#extremevetting
how does anyone in #45 administration able to get a security clearance considering ties to foreign governments
Trump gets a sec clearance b/c ID-10-Ts voted him in.
most of them. All of them?
Says who?
Ummm... All of them, most likely.
you mean besides Gorka, Bannon and Miller?
Stone Caputo Priebus Epshteyn Giuliani Kushner Cohen Sater Greenblatt McFarlane Lewandowski Ross Price Mnuchin
they didn't overlook they didn't care
ummm, YOU!
Trump.
Paging Doctor Gorka. Please come to the principal’s office. Please to bring your papers.
