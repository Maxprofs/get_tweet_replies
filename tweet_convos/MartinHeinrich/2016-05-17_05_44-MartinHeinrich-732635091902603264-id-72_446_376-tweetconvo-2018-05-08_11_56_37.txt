I want this schedule so bad!!! Laura for Senate.
.@clairecmc: Is base salary *still* $174 000? This is such an abuse of position!
Agreed. #VoteDemocratic
@MartinHeinrich lazy, irresponsible, mindless SOB's!!
. I.Believed.You.Then and I.Believe.You.Now! @GOP paid tax dollars to do nothing for the last 11.5 years. What a waste! #NoMoreGOP
@ohiomail Stop the paychecks
and neither dose the democraps!
@SenWhitehouse Either they're obstructing or not working. Sadly GOP  thinks they are good for the country. @SenateMajLdr sucks.
I saved this so I can post it again and again and again until November. Vote out GOP! you Dont work, you don't keep your JOB!
What is the #dems congressional work schedule? We already know #GOP is #bogus. Let's see how your work schedule is better
Nitwit.  The GOP is in charge of both houses now and therefore set the schedule for both.
Another weak excuse. So the #dems are "forced by the GOP" to only work on days set by #GOP??? Hah hahh! #BOGUS
Dude, you can't pass a bill if Senate's not in session. You can't even show up. No Congress, no work.
I get it. But I don't hear 1 single #dems Senator saying "I want t work more days this year". They r scheduled for 111 days
A clear indication of another wrong with our political structure in the United States. How could anything possibly get done? 
way to lead and continue the divisiveness in the country Claire!
Hey Claire, Kentucky repubs voted on March 5th.  You sounded confused and out of touch @MSNBC.  Time to recheck your meds.
kinda like this when the Republicans control the executive branch?
@NoShock Claire McCaskill you make me sick
and Rs want to cut funding to welfare expenditure. We need to cut funding to Republicans by voting them out.
@ohiomail Wait! Are the blacked out dates when they are out of Session? Jeez.
@SenWhitehouse That schedule looks like a redacted highly sensitive intelligent report explaining why R voters hate its leaders.
must be  nice
Well if you don't plan to do anything. Why go to work.
Oh , I'm sure you just bust your ass in office!  Bust it spreading misinformation maybe!
Post democrat schedule
Bernie wants to change direction of the country. NOT Hillary. Whats the matter with your brain or hearing?
and how much are senators paid?
senators should have to go to work more days than my 6 year old neighbor goes to school
can you please share the schedule from when Sen. Reid was the majority leader?
Wow and full benefits for life!
.@clairecmc and just what have you clowns done in 7.5 years?
#AssHoleThelioma
@CitronResearch So $MNK is not going to raise Acthar higher than $36k and they will never lower prices. Where is @clairecmc ???
<<<you're part of the problem, another Leech we need to kick out. Get a real job and work for yourself -- you're all Hypocrites
Nice job if you can get it. @clairecmc @SenWhitehouse
When I posted this before,many didn't believe it was real. It is. This is the R idea of a work schedule. 
@SenWhitehouse  Oh please. Do you have one for when Dirty Harry was in charge? Y'know...for comparison?  Of course not.
@hotelkeys vote out all incumbents every cycle regardless of party. Set a new culture in D.C.
They shouldn't get a check then, but hell they probably get plenty of money from the corps. they work for.....
Must be nice! I get 8 days vacation!
118 days...no wonder they thought Vet Choice could be running in 90 days...
@Alasscan_ Time to vote OUT the GOP.  Vote Dem "Straight Ticket"..that will do it!
@Maggyw519 Senator, I hope you or someone else is going to propose that they only get paid for actual days worked like the all
Wow! These Republicans has done absolutely nothing, Vote them out!
THIS & Trump = ?
@HillaryClinton @HFA Americans deserve better than what Republicans offer.
@BresPolitico well get busy and stop it. Let public know
perhaps we are better off that they don't show up more.....just think of how many more things could go wrong.
@owillis and then they choose to spend their time investigating Facebook.
but no time to vote on jobs bills or infrastructure bills or anything that would benefit the country
post yours
Democrats are the worst...
It shouldn't even take that many days to do nothing.
So the R's gave the D's pretty much everything they wanted and you are still complaining. Are you not all part of the problem?
tell 'em that's the schedule for janitorial/maintenance service and see how they react.
given the last 7 years, I would have preferred the Ds stay home every day instead of forcing Obamacare and the Iran deal on us
Good post @clairecmc This is a part-time schedule..NO more bennies! Part-time workers R NOT entitled to benefits in today's reality. TAKERS!
And they want $174,000 per year for that?
And they want a RAISE in pay!!!!!
That truly is a nauseating visual Claire, lol. Thanks for sharing it.
Does that include benefits?
Big time.
... and? My husband had to give his company back a weeks vacation ? This turns my stomach. Cherry on the cake, we still pay them!
Hey big mouth, it wasn't any better under Dingy Harry Reid, the scum bag of Congress.
@owillis Explains a lot. #DoYourJob
@UConn6thBorough @clairecmc @owillis of course, that does not include Obama's golfing days.
@owillis 
Oh well, as long as you get your work done.  Oh, wait...
@owillis Republicans are lazy
GOP congress = moochers
Let Bernie know; he wants a million ppl out Mitch's window to pass his agenda.  @answerallman
the country works better when the Senate stays home. Congress can't do that much damage when they aren't in Washington.
