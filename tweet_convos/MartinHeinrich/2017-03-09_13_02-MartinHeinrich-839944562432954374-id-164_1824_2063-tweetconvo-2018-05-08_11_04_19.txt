#TBThursday
@BTBall88 @SpeakerRyan It's normal thinking for GOP.  Consistency? Irrelevant?  What's good for the party? All that matters.
Ryan is a hypocrite. In fact, the leader and speaker of House hypocrites.

Three misleading claims from @SpeakerRyan's Obamacare lecture --> N
o. 1: Cherry-picking premium costs 
@SpeakerRyan @GOP  Hypocritical? Just saw Ryan on FOX "Not that concerned" about wealthy profits yet decreases in coverage with Trumpcare!

@SenateDems @SpeakerRyan @USCBO hypocrite & liar. Learned from @SenateMajLdr.Both r reason congress has a 9% approval rating
Paul Ryan is a Dick!
The unfortunate thing is even when evidence like this should shame them, it doesn't.

one of the few times I'm siding with you. Paul Ryan is a failure at this point.
One man's hypocrisy is another man's wising up & getting w/ the program...to screw citizens.
Pointing out GOP hypocrisy is like pointing out a skunks stinky butt. They R not ashamed. What will U do
PRyan is a major hypocrite. Double speaks Orwellian every time. He is the death spiral.
when it comes to hypocrisy NO dem should ever embarrass themselves with that word. are you pot or kettle
