stinks like Democrats, stinks like #fakenews, stinks like @CNN
Pictures aren't fake. How do you rationalize that this is ok?
an update is brought to both leaders, they confer and head to another room.  Just another defamation attempt on POTUS.  Over it.
how would you know?  Btw the repubs that turn blind eye are just as bad.
thats what the story I read says.  Its just blown out of porportion for defamation purposes.
What's the source of your story? Wa Post & CNN for me. Both reputable in the real world.
not one bit of truth to your claim that classified information was discussed. you are straw-manning sir. were you there? NO
Good job, son. I see you are proud @marine. Willing to die so millionaires can keep trophy wives + toys.Thank you.
as sarcastic as that was, I served my country and fought for your right to be so. you're welcome!
Huge respect for Marines. Semper Fi. The sarcasm is due to men of power using military for personal gain.
I understand that, however so far, that is not what I see in @realDonaldTrump. #givethedudeachance
he's already killed a @us_navyseals because he sent him in with incomplete intel. Unfit.
2/2 the operators train and prep for op. they give intel, Trump Ok's
@EdSkipper @bi_politics IMPEACH him!
But HRC's EMAILS(!).... & private server (& allegedly Trump now uses one of them + OLD (hackable) phone).
@NatashaBertrand actually NONE of their cell phones are protected.  #RepublicansDontCare
Are @SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC  concerned that wedding guests watch North Korea missile launch @ *45 home
@SenateDems @bi_politics I can c your emails from my house
They r so impressed w/themselves they wldn't recognize one moment that requires secrecy 
Public briefings are an unacceptable security risk but hey, Hillary, emails.  @MartinHeinrich @bi_politics
He doesn't want to read. Doesn't want to do the hard work. He just wants to attend dinners and photo opps and be adored.
No worries, because @jasoninthehouse will get to the bottom of this.
#AlternativeFacts
#FakeUtahn
well then, I feel secure knowing Jason is involved and he'll act decisively.
@realDonaldTrump He needs to be impeached for his outright negligence of our countries security! #maddow #lastword #amjoy
nothing and no one were secure. That's the point. His home earns him money & he takes PMs there? #conflict
All of Mar A Lago's members have security clearances at least as good as @IvankaTrump, I'm sure.
...and they are allowed front row seats 4 International crisis, photo ops...
"This photo is real but what it shows is fake (it is also the other way around for those who dig it that way)".
Japan was in the middle of a national crisis not the US but go on tell us more about how you know things.
@SenateDems no sound from #GOP peanut gallery as usual with this loose cannon,he can break all the laws,they say nothing
@SenateDems @bi_politics Agree - now what action will the Senate be taking.  We r past words, need action.
@SenateDems @bi_politics not to mention Mar A Lago's 64 H2B employees. Wonder if Putin sent any waiters?
BBBBBut Hilary had a private email server. AAAAhh. The press is the problem because I have the best words.)
agree. And HRC was crucified for her laxness in security. Why meet in an insecure place? Why not The WH?
Exactly! Why is he not hosting dips at White House? That place is set up for this.
just more amateur night in the Oaf Filled Office.
Japan was not impressed
@SenateDems @bi_politics but emails
It is so interesting to watch a world leader be turned into a 3rd world country. My plan is working out nicely.
This coming from the senator that thought Trump's personal mail bag was a "Top Secret Document" holder. Geez
@SenateDems @bi_politics the mob will get when has paid them back
more serious than a personal email server?
@SenateDems @bi_politics I doubt it's National Security talks with a reporter there holding a microphone - see picture.
@SenateDems @bi_politics Your right.
#TrumpIsUnfit He doesn't see a problem with this. #TrumpRussia Ties Span 4 Decades. MaraLago gives Putin entry.
@SenateDems @bi_politics They are so Dumb!!
@SenateDems @bi_politics first class act there prez.   What a joke
please impeach this imposter and dangerous toddler.
Photo op you #FakeNewsAlert liar. No real conversation being had you LIAR.
@SenateDems @bi_politics @potus and he made such a bid deal about Clintons emails. I guess security standards have changed!
Even Trump's twitterphone isn't! And Flynn's? To say nothing of guests, waiters...
Good thing Hillary was not there --her phone would've been the only unsecured one in the whole place, right?
any idea of trumps phone has ever been inspected?
By the Russians? I'm sure it has.
NOT COOL!
SHE WON STOLE HER PRESIDENCY.  PROTEST AGAINST HIM CABINET ELAINE CHAO FLYNN CHAFFETZ HATCH RYAN MCCONNELL
@SenateDems  Where's the outrage from the right?
NO I DON'T ANY PHONES WERE SECURED HE IS MENTALLY UNSTABLE UNFIT UNQUALIFIED ILLEGITIMATE THIEVE RIGGED IT
@SenateDems @bi_politics Is his cell phone secure?
Are you being sarcastic about the phones?
.@MartinHeinrich agree major SECURITY Breach! How is this happening? #nationalsecurity
What will you do about it?
@SenateDems @bi_politics but he keeps getting by with it what are your doing about it?
Where's the outrage?  Where's this investigation Chaffetz? @jasoninthehouse
Chaffetz & the Republicans don't want an investigation  They just want it to go away!
Yep. Hide their scared little heads in the sand. They will be humiliated in the end.
So what are the chances someone pushed Record?
@realDonaldTrump When are the Republicans going to stand up to this joke of a president?
@SenateDems @bi_politics @realDonaldTrump learned another use for his cell phone besides tweeting...it's a flashlight too!
how long till someone jumps the prez at mar-a-lago? Are guests vetted? Security clearance? Wtf.
After all the hoopla about HRC's email server, you'd think Trump and his staff would know better. #Hubris.
...and of COURSE everyone in the room had Clearances.
Trump like to show off. It never occurred to him to move to a private room to take that call. Just a tough guy.
so easy to be a spy these days. Just show up at one of his shows and smile at him while migrating phone maybe.
@SenateDems @bi_politics really we just believe now. Where are the FACTS that they and the people there were secure?
the majority of story was based upon people at the club reporting what "they saw" to CNN
@SenateDems @bi_politics - wow!  simply unbelievable
@SenateDems @bi_politics Oh I'm sure everyone's at Mar a Lago has a Top Secret clearance - even the bus boys.
@SenateDems @bi_politics sen. king from ny just on Jake trapper there was nothing wrong with this
I assume Trump's own phone was compromised by the Kremlin ages ago. @SenateDems
THEY WERE MORE SECURE THAN HILLARYS EMAILS OR THE DNC EMAILS
NO access for us thru media, but paying guests get to see it all. @MartinHeinrich @bi_politics
Your prior tweets show other serious natsec concerns. That leaves the question. What are you going to do about it Senator?
@funder
@senrobportman dear Sen. Portman. Wanted you to see this.
this is insane
How utterly STUPID! Doesn't T have his own security? Surely one or two of them would've said something. They're worthless.
exactly. I'm sending letters!
that is amazing
@SenateGOP @HouseGOP What are you going to do about this breech in national security and the ongoing ethics iss
Don't talk to me about classified.  See hillary.
Just imagine if this were Hillary. The republicans would have immediate impeachment hearings.
