@WhiteHouse I voted for @POTUS Obama the 1st time & don't vote GOP b/c most r racist but Trump & Bernie r better than Obama, DEMS & REPUB
@TheColdCivilWar @WhiteHouse @POTUS "but Trump & Bernie r better than Obama DEMS & REPUB"  I said most & u said all do u know the difference
@TheColdCivilWar @WhiteHouse @POTUS  I've never considered Trump racist
@TheColdCivilWar @WhiteHouse @POTUS Check your reality b/c there are racist Republicans and racist Democrats among us!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Obama is such a fake, weak & punk ass coward w/out enough class, character & courage to nominate an A/A male to SCOTUS
@WhiteHouse @POTUS what a disgrace to law abiding citizens.  Few more months and this will all change
@WhiteHouse @robertcyoung I am just embarrassed about how people treat and respond to what @POTUS does at this point.
@jonathanjstone0 Nothing surprises me from Americans at this point.
@robertcyoung When a population votes more for contests than for @POTUS, you know we hit a low point.
@jonathanjstone0 I lost faith a long time ago when I was in the military. When citizens stood by and let Iraq happen I was done.
@robertcyoung @jonathanjstone0 you blame the people for that? What inside info did they have? Easy to be blinded by 9/11 too.
@robertcyoung @jonathanjstone0 I see where you're coming from, though. I just find it hard to blame citizens.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS GOD BLESS THE NRA!!!!
@WhiteHouse @robertcyoung @POTUS I am embarassed to be a US citizen watching how our government and population has unraveled into lunacy.
@WhiteHouse @robertcyoung @POTUS With all the negative responses about this, I think I may give up my US citizenship sooner than expected.
@WHWeb @POTUS THIS IS MY GUY & HIS NAME IS BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS si esta imagen es de verdad,a traves de la ventana con satélites y robot se puede ver lo que dicen los papeles de la mesa

@WhiteHouse @POTUS @TheLibertyEagle WASPS invented the USA. There should be at least ONE Protestant on SCOTUS. Without them USA decays.

@WhiteHouse @POTUS This should not be happening the next President should choose not this thing. Impeach him now America need life again.
@WhiteHouse @AllenEllis14 @POTUS Will we be able to spell the SCOTUS nominee's name? In the pool, I have a Muslim woman. I never win anyway.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS - The repub senate will meet him and still reject him.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS -Nothing but political armstronging to prove You CAN do this. The Repub senate will not bite.
@WhiteHouse @dreamjar @POTUS really? This is the guy you want?
@kittykaraoke I'll read up, Sean. Initially just glad to see motion, but of course, there's no open indication that a hearing will occur.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS mr. obama is irrelevant nobody gives a damn what he wants in eight months will have a new president elect.
@Lg4Lg @WhiteHouse @POTUS YOU MAD TOO!!!! :-)
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Obama knows this nomination is going nowhere but he does Shit to divide America further on top of his Racist Views!!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS It is time to checkmate the GOP senators. Let see if they still  believe in the rule of law.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS why the hurry? Coz it's your job? Well we the people have rights to tell you to wait! Why don't you listen.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS 92% of @cspan listeners,  REPUBS & DEMS, supported confirmation of a new @SCOTUSnom selection. @ChuckGrassley has failed.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS it's gonna be @JudgeJudy
@WhiteHouse @kalpenn @POTUS if it's not @HowardStern then I don't care
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Don't those big ears work? The Republicans said, they will not vote on it because your a #LAME duck. Deal with it.

@WhiteHouse @POTUS You should clearly wait until Mr. Trump is in office to choose CORRECTLY! You have done way to much!
@WhiteHouse @KimBrownTalks @POTUS why do i feel this was dragged out on purpose knowing Republicans won't act on nomination anyway
@WhiteHouse @POTUS glad you are doing your job even though your opponent been try to stop you. Hopefully you choose wisely.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS I hope that nominee doesn't get picked until November, when we will get a real president of the United States!!!

@WhiteHouse @PatrickQuinn414 @POTUS my money is on Judge Judy
@WhiteHouse 
この事の判決が、違法憲法であり、犯罪に値する内容があり、高等裁判所に控訴申請しましたが、ガサ入れをお願いいたします。伊勢志摩サミットで、恥をかかせて、東京裁判の極東軍事裁判をお願いいたします。
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Hooray
