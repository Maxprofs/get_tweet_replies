Hi Ed.  We would like to use your animation on Weather Underground tonight on The Weather Channel.  May we have permission?
Of course - happy for it to be used!
Thank you!  Whom should we credit--You specifically or University of Reading?
Ideally both please! But, just me if not - thanks!
We'll take care of it, Ed.  Thank you again.
@ed_hawkins That looks logarithmic.  I hope that it's not logarithmic.
@colonelmattyman Radial axis is linear.
@ed_hawkins Sorry. I was referring to the speed that it was moving out from the center.
@colonelmattyman OK - all frames are one year and equal length in time.
Hence it is appearing logarithmic in growth, as it is not growing linearly on the linear background .-)
Love the spiral graphic. Question: Have you considered pairing it with similar data showing fossil fuel consumption rates?
Thanks - there are spirals for other climate data such as CO2 levels & sea ice here: http://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/spirals/ 
don't know if you have seen or agree with this ammendment ...
Have seen it. One model simulation for high emissions scenario - would be great to generalise to show other simulations too
Great visual! We'd love to use this in an upcoming video about coral conservation. Can we use with appropriate credit(s)?
Of course - feel free to use it! Would be interested in seeing the video when it's done - please could you send a link?
The 1850 12 monthly temperatures should all be on the 0° circle and they are not; why ?
The zero circle is the average of 1850-1900, as used by the IPCC to approximate pre-industrial
@ed_hawkins Hi. Do you know what happened roughly 1882-84? That's a bigger pop than 1998 or 2016 el niños.
@stevefb1 Well spotted - very large El Nino event in 1877-78 which is the obvious spike in the late 19th century.
can I use your animation in an online article and attribute to you? Jeff Masters of @wunderground showed this and (cont.)
No problem - it is free to be used: http://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/spirals/  @wunderground
Awesome. Thanks  @wunderground
@ed_hawkins brilliant (scary) temp spiral - arctic sea ice extent spiralling towards zero centre next?
@vscottedinburgh Similar graphics have been made before for the Arctic by @ahaveland, e.g.
#Arctic Death Spiral - April 2016 sea ice vol record low, biggest drop over prev April. http://haveland.com/share/arctic-death-spiral.jpg … 
. @ed_hawkins similar graphs have been made, described as death spirals, and put back climate communications amongst the public?!
@ed_hawkins loving this THANK U. Improvem't ideas for Mark II: fade data older than 10(?)yrs; colour code green (<.5deg), amber (<1), red??
@FinnJackson2 Thanks for suggestions! Chose 'viridis' colours to help those who are red-green colour blind: http://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/2015/reinventing-colour-wheel/ …
@ed_hawkins Very good. Your gif, your choice. Great to see this trending :o)
@ed_hawkins @Liv_Boeree Is 160years enough of a trend to draw any real conclusion? Cycles on Earth probably last thousands of years.
@Btek02 @ed_hawkins yes. NATURALLY occuring cycles do take 1000s years.And exactly why we should be so alarmed at the rate of change shown.
@Btek02 @ed_hawkins a climate heating this fast is likely to lead to dangerous consequences in the near future (next 30-100 yrs).
@Liv_Boeree @Btek02 @ed_hawkins 1.4° C in 166 years isn't fast or catestrophic considering multi century cycles of the sun, oceans etc...
@MendyWax @Btek02 @ed_hawkins it's not like it's going to stop at 1.4, even if we suddenly stop global CO2 emissions overnight.
@Liv_Boeree @Btek02 @ed_hawkins if as most skeptics believe there are natural drivers ie long term solar cycles, then it's likely to reverse
"Likely to reverse" based on what data? You simply prayed to the gods for insight, didn't you?
based on past solar cycles that have gone to minimums and corresponding temps on Earth went down
2022. I’ll mark it in my diary......ffs.
..can i use your animation for my presentation!
Fascinating depiction.
@eduardaa_rochaa
You mean the Chinese invented this "hoax" in 1850 already? Man, that's some serious forethought...
Le degazage a commencer, le methane vas nous tuer bien avant que les niveaux ne monte.
@floschechter I stare at the end, mentally projecting that 2016 spiral out through '17, '18, '19... 
@KKvisler 

That is not spiralling or dramatic but a small gradual fluctuation
@shitHRCsays   Yeah we're all going to die but lemmings always do #BernieorGoddamnBust
(cont.) ... I thought it was extremely helpful in illustrating the concern. Thanks for the consideration.
@coffeenexus everyone should have awarness If this , mostly in the coffee world.
it's such a good representation of why agriculture globally is having to adapt, and coffee isn't immune
coffee is been affected extremely flowering,Harvest time have changed. Dry season comes into loser quality.
is your data source available for this amazing chart Mr. Hawkins? kind regards
@johnramos91 I noticed the chemtrails starting in modesto shortly after this spike in our earth's Temps. Too much coincidence
Who took all those readings world wide in 1850 and with what accuracy?
thank you very self-explanatory gif!

@TheAntiGOP Politicians new but kept advocating policies that exasperated the problem.
There is no increase in global temperature. This is just an optical effect.
@ed_hawkins @cirquelar
please tell me you're joking...
I'm offended that you even have to ask.
maybe I'm just thin-skinned today. Don't mind me.
great visualisation
So fucking exciting! Love it! I want a front row seat for the whole 'Game Over' shebang! Shit, I might just found my calling..
Not happy with this data because of variation in measurement device, where, corrections to compare,error bar.Weak stuff =skeptic

Is the spiral possible to share on Instagram?
Can @TonyAbbott please look at this!
bunk false data. Doesn't account for orbit variation current closest in 500 years. Shame on you Fix CA drought vs waite#tcot
global warming is the biggest hoax ever perpetuated on mankind these scientists will never debate any1 that disgrees
Hopefully this converts a few more deniers. We all need to pull together and make positive changes #GetOutOfTheShowerCameron! @ed_hawkins
With earth nearing the end of a 10,000 year interglacial period it should be fun to watch your graph document global cooling.
/Great, people need to know global warming!!!
simple is smart
Does this account for all the exposed pavement now than in 1850, plus all the concrete buildings. Exposed rock radiates heat.
Great animation. Suggestion: Make it 3D, like a chimney. Wouldn't 'hide' oldest data & show increase/acceleration more clear.
I have asked for error bars but this guy ignores  them. Will referee his work accordingly

And why would you pick that date to start from?
Fabulous graphic! Recalling Earth's crossing 400ppm #CO2 was awful, yet knowing how fast this was done is key.

really does us educators a great service with this Gif.
Excellent.

great graphic. Plz excuse my silly question but how does one get an average temperature to represent the globe?
Now include the little ice age and the medieval warm period, like so
This global temperature visualisation is incredible! // @aggyk @ed_hawkins @infobeautiful
BTW Ted Cruz has no climate science credibility. The above 'debate' was political only, with ill intentions. Fossil fuel power.

thx for showing it's real folks!
If your doctor says to you with the following screen: "You have fever". Would you trust him?
Only 160 years or so? Trivial in climate. How about a longer time scale, to be more honest?
Great graphic! ! Why is starting in 1850? Could you extend it to former years?

@Nasa_SpaceTime What about the theory that global warming brought us out of the last ice age and is keeping us out of the next?
it's hilarious to start this in 1850, a hundred years before significant impact from man-made CO2, yet imply all is due to man
@SenatorWong the neysayers wont believe you until their arses are fried. But keep trying to convince them what else can we do?
@arianna_lauren  data is inconclusive, as time has progressed we can obtain data from more and more areas, therefore increasing.
would it be okay for me to use your global temperature model in a paper i am writing for University?
Would one on the damage of the rising global population and its needs, look worse?
@wwf_uk This is SUCH a good representation! A clearly shocking trend
This is a brilliantly simple illustration of #climate change pattern. Not about causes, just what's happening. HT @ed_hawkins
Great Visualization! This is one I made to get an impression what 1To Co2 is …
congratulations. Your tweet have 8457 RT.
The claim that they're "spiraling" is spurious; that implies exponential increases.
Do you actually consider this absurd visualization to be even remotely scientific???
This is no news.  But where is the link to anthropogenic CO2?
There is none.
I know, but that doesn't fit the politics that thrive on alarmism.
It just went live, crediting you, on my @RebelMouse http://rbl.ms/1sfRorM

@SimonZerafa Were these global temperatures taken in a consistent manner, always using the same measuring point? I doubt it.
I don't doubt climate change. I doubt a 100% human cause. I also doubt we can do anything about it.
