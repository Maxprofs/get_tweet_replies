Love & thanks to @PBS, media of my childhood. Entertaining, educational shows accessible to kids with or without cable. Always a PBS Kid @
Quality media isn't just for people who can afford to pay for it. That's why #ILOVEPBS
@IndependentLens , @frontlinepbs , and @novapbs are absolutely amazing! Plus I'm a 1st generation @sesamestreet kid. #ILovePBS
I can watch intense dramas w/ accurate historical context w/ my now 4 yo nephew without fear of inappropriate language or images. #ILovePBS
@Kaygirl8Lawana PBS is the only place to see qaulity shows and have your whole family educated at the same time.
#ILOVEPBS because I grew up with Sesame Street and Bob Ross, @NewsHour is my tv news, and @masterpiecepbs is always a gem!
lastly all 3 of my children grew up watching PBS. It is enormously important to me & my fam.
Sesame Street, Electric Company, Mr. Rogers Neighborhood, Masterpiece Theater, Nova, Documentaries..My kid learned things #ILovePBS
Orig Masterpiece Thtr, Mr Rogers, Thtr in America, Doctor Who, Dance in America, so many more.  I, Claudius one of greatest series ever
but the MAIN reason #ILOVEPBS ?  Fred Rogers is my personal hero. May we all strive to live with even an ounce of his grace.
Thank you @PBS. Mister Rogers Neighborhood made me who I am. In The Life showed me there were other gay people in the pre-internet world.
reading rainbow helped me grow to love reading. 
the only opinion that matters
My Little nephew could recognize Tavis Smiley and Charlie Rose at 2, and would be excited for the news to come on. #ILovePBS
American Experience, @KenBurns , @HenryLouisGates ... you are the reason I have such a huge love of history!!! 
my Mom introduced my siblings & I to PBS & Ive watched countless specials & shows & learned SO much! It's still a huge part of my life.
allowed me to see so many amazing live performances I would have never been able to experience. #theatre #music
2 reason to hate pbs:
1. you fired elmo
2. you killed mr. rogers
worked on Alzheimer's unit & I would put Lawrence Welk on & they would hum & sing along. W/out you that wouldn't have happened #SavePBS
also I cannot forget all of the amazing television that @HenryLouisGates has brought me and my kids through PBS!! Thanks is no enough!!
how do 68% of kids watch, yet 82% of households... aren't the kids IN the household? Fake stats
Yes, there are houses with, without kids, houses with multiple kids. Two separate stats, complimentary.
My mom and I would watch the Jeremy Brett #SherlockHolmes together. Started my love of mystery and crime fiction. #ILovePBS
How about Brother Cadfael?
I <3 @PBS because when I was little, #BobRoss was the one thing that soothed the anxiety I didn't know I had back then.
I live in Australia and I love PBS.

Your well earned reputation extends well beyond the oceans!
Sesame Street was my first classroom. One of the best educational experiences I've ever had.
Lilias, Yoga and You...before yoga became mainstream. Fantastic. #ILOVEPBS #yoga #pbs
I grew up on Sesame Street and Reading Rainbow!!!  #ILovePBS
Sane & Thought-Filled Political News on "Washington Week"

Electric Company and ZOOM! #ILOVEPBS
come on and zoom zoom zoom azoom...my fav back in the day!
Boston, Mass, 02134!
I always wondered what ever happened to Edith?!
I thought those Zoom kids were the absolute coolest! Hubbi Friubbends!
#ILOVEPBS because my daughter was and is able to watch so much quality programming and my son will be able to as well!
showed me what the world was like outside my small town. Were it not for PBS, I have no idea what my life would be like. #ILOVEPBS
My best friend hates fireworks, and @PBS allows us to celebrate the 4th with ALL of our fellow Americans without the anxiety #ILovePBS
omg! I loved Sesame Street as a child & the wood wright man, Julia child, the frugal gourmet & this old house were huge in my house.
.@BackwoodsJim @PBS @DJT_POTUS45 

"Should of"? You should watch some PBS programming. You'll sound less ignorant. You'll be less ignorant.
#ILOVEPBS because I learn something new almost every time I turn it on. Thank you @NewsHour, @novapbs, @PBSNature, @frontlinepbs, etc 
to be fair, yesterday I learned that after 7 years of prep Republicans lied.
I @PBS and respect @frontlinepbs even more (rigorous process) after being able to participate in one of the shows. #ilovePBS
knowing reporters & editors for local Public Radio and TV in WI. I have also gained huge respect for them too
You respect liars?
@likepenguins 
#ilovepbs
Educating my adult self on the real lives of everyone unlike me! Thank you!
someone mentioned Anne of Green Gables & it was watching it on @KCTS9 that fell in love with the miniseries from 30 yrs ago
#ilovepbs b/c of @AmExperiencePBS @masterpiecepbs @readingrainbow @frontlinepbs #mrrogersneighborhood @SesameWorkshop
My mother & I loved him. He was so special. He loved all, & included every race & ethnicity on his show.
let Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Robert Wood Johnson et. al pay for it. #CutTheBudget #MAGA @realDonaldTrump
yes because its better to give our hard earned money to Trump and his family living in NYC. Zero logic.
#ILOVEPBS because they air my childhood (Thomas & Friends) to this day.
@ValuePBS Where do I sign petition to keep funding PBS?
#ilovepbs ! you guys are great, stay gold!
IPBS for instilling love of history and interest in politics. #ILOVEPBS
you're leftist crusading is blatant, #defundpbs
PBS brings the Arts to rural families all over America. Growing up in the country, far away from live theater is hard! PBS
Well, for one thing they've cost us too much in taxes. No conservative views expressed. Taxation w/o representation.
PBS Introduced me to different cultures, how things are made & Wynton Marsalis who made me love music even more.
waste of money, only promotes liberal agenda.
defund now
Art Teachers and students need access to quality programs such as Art 21 and Craft in America #NEA #ILovePBS
First words for my daughter, 32, included "bir" for Big Bird. Family favs incl Masterpiece Theater and @NewsHour. #ilovePBS
Sesame Street
Electric Company
3-2-1 Contact
Square One
NOVA
And Mister FREAKIN' Rogers

The channel is indispensable. #ilovepbs
Also, with my children today, @PBS gives us Curious George, Odd Squad, Daniel Tiger, and so much more! #ILOVEPBS
"SOCIAL IMPACT INITIATIVES" that's what Sesame Street is teaching...just because someone is sensitive to noise, doesn't mean autistic
how effective really is it, when only 37% or so, of high school graduates can pass the college readiness test?
PBS taught this doctor English when she was 4 and the only immigrant in her Harrisburg PA school #IlovePBS
There are almost no good sources of television (or cable) news today. The exception? #PBS @NewsHour. For this & many other reasons #ILovePBS
it has taught me how to beg for money 24/7
#ILovePBS for the education, imagination, information, & entertainment that it gives me, & even more importantly, my children #SUPPORT
@RileyKilburg six grown children- this was their first learning experience. We all watched together and learned. Me too!
don't forget Austin city limits..
People who love PBS should pay for PBS. Stop stealing my money to pay for something other people love.
@jennr473 ...AND Who Can Forget Bob Ross's Painting Series!!! He Opened the Door for me to Explore Painting?!!!#ILOVEPBS
@jennr473 As an Adult, I Learned New Cooking And Gardening  Tips Through The Many Wonderful Cooking and Gardening Shows #ILOVEPBS
@jennr473 Rd As a Child, I Learned to Read Count and Imagine through Wonderful Programs Like Sesame Street + Mr. Rogers #ILOVEPBS
The Electric Company introduced me to a life long crush, Morgan Freeman. I was four years old #ILovePBS
#ILovePBS for your fantastic documentaries. @frontlinepbs #learnsomethinngneweveryday
I'm 1 of the millions who was raised on PBS & truly hope the children of now can share the same honor of being raised w/ such honesty.
Secrets of the Six Wives, The Tunnel, Vicious. I've gone over 9 and could go on. PBS is that important to me.
television without PBS. 3 more shows of my top 9. Great British Baking Show, Sherlock, Downton Abbey, Victoria,
and has reinforced what we teach him about nature when we go outside. I'm a sustaining member and I cannot imagine
important part of my life and now my son's life. Peep & The Big Wide World has expanded his curiosity of the world
3-2-1 Contact, NOVA, all these I watched as a kid and contributed to my intellectual curiosity. PBS is an
Masterpiece. I started watching w/my Mom when I was 4. Series was Flambards. Sesame Street, Electric Company,
my son grew up watching Curious George. Sesame Street helped him learn so much, he also had speech therapy then. 
Thank you 
Watching Mr. Rogers on #PBS exposed my childhood trauma -- I told an adult. @PBSKIDS #NationalEndowmentfortheHumanities @SenateGOP
@nml423 Need I say more?
 #Wishbone
I learn something new everyday #ILOVEPBS
Anne of Green Gables! #nostalgia #ILOVEPBS
News Hour w/ ppl like Gwen Ifill, Jim Lehrer, & Judy Woodruff providing excellent reporting for years #ilovepbs
Grew up watching AM Weather, Mr. Rogers, @sesamestreet . Now I watch American Experience, @novapbs & @frontlinepbs . #ILOVEPBS
.@PBS @chuckatwbhm Sesame St., Curious George & Dora were passed to our kids (now 12 & 14). They both to read and school. #ILOVEPBS
only reasonable news no
From Mr. Rogers to Masterpiece Theatre. I've been a viewer for 40+ years. #ILOVEPBS
amigo.......friend, amigo....friend, amigo=friend #sesamestreet
Love PBS but fact is it is nonessential and thus we are borrowing money from China, etc., to subsidize. Raise more funds or make cuts.
#ilovepbs #anneofgreengables
I've been learning from PBS since I was a little boy. I'm still learning. Wouldn't know what to see in Europe without Rick Steves.
my kids take the lessons they learned from #naturecat #readyjetgo and  #wildkratts to the classroom and the great outdoors #ILovePBS
awesome shows, reliable news, its free, documentary are awesome, there always something to watch. Charlie Rose great interviews
My children watched Sesame Street when they were young. My grandchildren watch Daniel Tiger, Thomas the Train, Curious George. #SavePBSKids
everything from learning about the world through #frontline to learning more about my community through #greaterboston #ILovePBS
I have the honor of doing what I love, exploring the past and changing lives on #PBS. I  PBS #GenealogyPBS #genealogy #ancestry
Without PBS I probably still would have never seen any of @HamiltonMusical. Now my stuffed kitteh's named after Eliza. #ILOVEPBS
there's a naivety to the perspective to say only tax dollars can sustain PBS; an effective brainstorm would alter that immediately.
if they can't support themselves through advertising they should shut down, no welfare television
@POTUS #defundNPR #defundPBS
my dream is to one day create a show that will air on pbs! Like my series #QuestToChangeTheWorld  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHMB_XeSZWk …
downton downton downton
my 17 y/o son is going off to college next year, amazing memories watching big bird and Elmo !! Thank you!!
@sorola Hey. How is the rest of that Jill Stein interview? Pbs is as trustworthy as .mic
Complete bullshit #FakeNews stats!
as far as I'm concerned, and many others: #PBS is the ONLY ethical,educational, and useful programming. Entertaining is a given! 
love PBS FOR BIG BIRD!!! Mr. Rogers and Thomas the Tank. #ILovePBS
I can recite (sing) the Preamble to the Constitution.
I love to watch @PBSFood every Saturday to get inspiration for my week ahead.
@netflix @CBS @BankofAmerica @PNCBank @comcast this and plenty other to sponsor a good thing which could be made more accessible
PBS, almost everyone knows, documentaries, essential, arts, nature, and more
@kiracomedy are you freaking kidding me?  #sesamestreet
No it hasn't in years .Sorry .
please just go away, let your liberal friends support you
I agree w/so much said here. NewsHour, Gwen, Sesame St, Frontline, Sherlock, & these past yrs, for introducing me to Call the Midwife.
you will do just fine with advertisers supporting and not my tax dollars. 1.3b from sesame at merch alone. You're good.
I've loved you all of my life.My daughter has to have same experience Plus where else can I get "televised courses" w/@HenryLouisGates
thank you PBS
Such an important part my daily life #PBSNews #ILovePBS
Love Some of PBS but not infomercials for uber left that pass as political reporting; don't want my tax $ supporting it #defundnewshour
Maybe you should ask every citizen for a matching $1.35...
By introducing me to great shows like Masterpiece and American Experience #ILOVEPBS
PBS is extremist leftist globalist anti-Tump propaganda. 100% taxpeyers pay 4 PBS, yet 50% voters get spat in the face #DefundPBS
#ILovePBS for @NewsHour! Also great @BBC programming. My sister and I grew up on Sesame Street & Mr Rogers.
Because Bob Ross #Ilovepbs
Antiques Roadshow time with my family has given us years of great memories! #Ilovepbs
And way too many reasons to not.
Perhaps some of these PBS that morphed into multi million, if not billion dollar industries, can pay it forward.
.@PBS #ILOVEPBS for educating people of ALL ages & backgrounds on a multitude of subjects for young & old
I bet a lot of people would watch that just to see how much tRump supporters regret their vote for the Orange one!
Idea on ways to fund PBS: Start a new show called "We've Been Trumped"! A show about people that voted for him and got screwed!
Trump's guy said coal miners don't want PBS like they are too stupid to appreciate it
ONE of Trump's golf trips would pay for PBS, what Trump's doing is despicable
when i was growing up your affiliate in Fort Wayne was the only channel i could get over the air. I grew up learning from you Thank you
#ILovePBS I grew up with Sesame Street. I love all things @PBS @NewsHour @PBSNature @frontlinepbs We need #PBS now, more than ever.
Has always been about truth and education for me....it is TRUE wealth
Why didn't U & NPR fight the #GOPReich harder? Since Reagan, U rolled over every time. U even put a Koch on your board. #RESISTANCE
@JmMlSd I raised both of my adult children on PBS
because @masterpiecepbs brings us Sherlock, Poldark, Downton, Lewis, midsomer & so much more #ILOVEPBS
bc as a mom, Daniel tiger's neighborhood has taught me as much in parenting tips as it has my toddlers in social cues. #ILOVEPBS
I love lots of thing. Doesn't mean I think the federal government should fund it.
How about a banner on your twitter and website to let all people clearly know what's up, instead of assuming they know you are threatened?
@alanap98 Love PBS from the UK The Moth is awesome!
you guys are one of the only good television stations, you do not deserve a cut in funding
PBS should be defunded. Waste of taxpayer dollars.
Why can't PBS go public like other companies. Surely they have a large enough audience to sustain its broadcast?  It can stay open.
Let the billionaire Hollywood libs support your cause
Wonderful Shakespeare, Sherlock, educational shows, documentaries - on & on, nourishment for the soul, broadening for the mind
.@PBS #ILovePBS because growing up I watched Sesame St. & Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood all the time, and now I love watching your nature docs.
I love and watch PBS.
#ILovePBS because my children learned so much from it. We sang Sesame Street songs & discussed Mr. Rogers lessons!
You and everyone else around the world  :)
Yup! I can't imagine a world without Sesame Street. Srsly.
#ILOVEPBS Without it I'd of never found Monty Python and Doctor Who! I can't imagine how dull life would be without them.
#SaveBigBird
#ILOVEPBS I grew up with Sesame Street, Mr. Rodgers. Love Masterpiece. NOVA, PBS NewsHour & Frontline keep me informed. #SaveBigBird!
Sesame Street: 'You have to put down the duck to play the saxophone!' Bert & Ernie, numbers with The Count, kindness with all the cast.
I fell in love with Arthur and continue to watch the show to this day and I'm 22 years old. Cable shows don't compare. #ILOVEPBS
just watched a video of yours in class today. U said all white people in 1990 thought all other races were unintelligent? Racist PBS!
#ILOVEPBS because everything I watched as a child was on there- Sesame Street, Zoom, Wishbone, Arthur- I loved them all!
Here we go it's budget time again, whining for more money to donate back to the DNC. Nice racket. #draintheswamp
#IDontLikePBS
Thank Obama for adding 10T to our debt!
I love and support pbs @ NPR, just not sure all taxpayers should
Arts is for everyone and not only for rich. I want to see real artist not comercial events.
bring me real art to my home no matter au do not have money to enjoy it.PBS give liberty!
Sunday night PBS is my therapy after surfing through the jungle of mediocrity on cable

#ILOVEPBS grew up on Sesame Street raised kids learning letters, songs and values my son still reminds me Grover says "accidents happen
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yIrTsWjun5w&feature=youtu.be …
@frontlinepbs helps me understand major world events  it connects & informs. Ebola Outbreak showed me true bravery and human compassion
#Education #Art #Culture #News #Policy  #SociallyConscious
Remember when PBS was the place to see "Monty Python's Flying Circus" in the early 1970s? I do! #ILovePBS #UncontaminatedByCheese
haven't watched PBS in years
PBS was an instrumental source of knowledge for me as a youth- I will forever be indebted to its exemplary educational programming
So why does PBS Newshour pander to Fox and the Right Wing? Because that's where the money comes from.
You've made British TV accessible to American viewers and allowed me to watch all my fav shows. Idk what I'd do without you #ILovePBS
Mr. Rogers taught me to care about people and respect my thoughts and feelings. #ILOVEPBS
Sesame Street taught me shapes, letters, numbers, basically my entire pre-k education. #ILOVEPBS
yes I like you but you should be totally privately funded
#ILovePBS My son who now has PhD. in engineering first understood math from a show on PBS.
@PrincessBravato Downton Abbey!!!!
Sesame Street! However Children grow up. Learn about American Capitalism. Pay bills. Realize the screwing. Leftist Brainwash is PBS.
It has brought England to me and enriched my life with such wonderful and diverse programming.#ILovePBS.
Compete like everyone else mooches.
I taught myself to read by watching @WordWorld . It helped made me the snazzy reader I am today!
you do good and tax dollars are not needed to do that.
