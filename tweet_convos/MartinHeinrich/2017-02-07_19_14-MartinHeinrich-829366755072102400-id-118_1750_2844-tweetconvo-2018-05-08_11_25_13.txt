@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr There is no place for a racist letter to be read in a confirm hearing IT IS RACIST ITSELF TO DO SO
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr This is just another move of GOP racist discriminating wayof doingbusiness.Time limit forpoliticians
well, next time #letliznotbreaktherules
@dashannestokes CSK was right 30 yrs ago, & she is still right today! Their behavior was shameful, reprehensible!
Wait - you're saying "Coretta Scott King is speaking from the grave" about Jeff Sessions?? I'll assume #FakeNews...
Mrs. King Will delegitimize Sessions from grave as a result of this. More ppl will know of that letter than ever
He will be confirmed like all the rest of Trump's great picks.
what makes Sessions a "great pick"?
Warren name calls while New England genealogical society finds she is not a native Indian! @FoxNews
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr Great job! Time to move on with the countries business vs listening to the #soreloser Dems.
A civil rights icon is shut up but a criminally incompetent & morally repugnant Trump isn't. ??
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr The Dems are going to lose again. How many times will you be defeated before you learn?
@senrobportman after selling out Ohio children for @BetsyDevos will you now support racist @SenatorSessions too?
McConnelll is as much a racist as Sesseions. Kentucky, isn't it time you got rid of disgusting ole Turtle Face?
Oh get off it. Cory Booker is a criminal. Are we going to get some honesty from the Dems ever?
whether it's immigration LAWS or senate RULES Dems spit on precedent when it suits them
breaking the rules bc they agree with the  motives another example of #progressivehypocrisy

Lot of people interested in the UnAmerican activities

@SenSchumer
NO USING MRS KINGS WORDS FROM THE GRAVE, IS DISGRACEFUL, ESP SEEING DEMS ARE BEHIND THE DEMISE OF THE KING FAMILY
#FAKENEWS Why does the CBC advocate for the Democratic Party in the U.S. hmm!
Keep it up. Voters will vote again and you will lose more seats. Yeh! Delay, Delay, Delay,
The GOP is full of closed minded bigots.I see this in their actions and rhetoric.They are a danger to this World
You do realize that Martin King Jr and his wife Corretta Scott King were Republicans ...right?

@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr you are full of it.  No she wasn't she was brainwashed by dems to believe that
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr she broke senate rules you know that.
Written in another time & place.
@jimmyj48125 @SenateMajLdr Senator Mc Connelly is a shame on the American people. Vote him out!!!
@jimmyj48125 @SenateMajLdr Senator, what are you so afraid of?
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr when you vote "No", call Coretta Scott King's  name out and vote. http://bit.ly/CorettaKing 
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr  Everyone should read the letter on the floor. This our house not McConnell. Read that letter!

WHY wasn't  the letter brought up earlier in the process and addressed in the hearings? Please keep FACTS coming. TY
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr 
What are the Republicans afraid of in that letter? TRUTH???
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr READ THE KING LETTER! Every Senator!
That letter from Coretta was her opinion, and not reality. Sessions was only alleging voter fraud
she lied about being a Native American to get a job intended for a "real" minority #No credibility
And we are celebrating Black History month!
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr who cares what she thinks. @MitchMcConell #nuclearoption will stop Democrat games and keep us safe

@senatedems ru libdems REALLY that stupid&full of hate that ur USING CSK 2 lie abt Warren!OMGosh no wonder u lost
apparently the rules don't apply equally to all senators, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/07/24/ted-cruz-calls-mitch-mcconnell-a-liar-on-the-senate-floor/?utm_term=.dc2bc4193733 …
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3259988-Scott-King-1986-Letter-and-Testimony-Signed.html#document/p1 …
Sessions was too racist to be a fed judge in 1986. 1986!! Do you realize how steep on the racist curve that is?!?
#LetLizSpeak
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr No, she wasn't.
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr Excuse me sir, your misogyny is showing.
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr @OfficialCBC Too racist for 1986, too racist for 2017 #NoConcessionOnSessions #LetLizSpeak
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr Word has it that Warren violated senate rules. Let's be honest when relaying the story.
Come @CNN make this story BIGGER dammit!
U democrats, have no shame. U do whatevr it takes, legal or not, ethical or not 2 stop repubs, whiner
That action made me angry enough to call my Senators again. RT dedicated to CBC tomorrow.
Follow the rules. You seem to know exactly which rules work to stop proceedings, delay votes... selective keeping to the rules?
LITTLE reptillian man,crafting your propaganda 4 the media 2 revomit, lying 2 americans abt procedure
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr There won't be ignoring, minimizing,or looking away in 2017.
<--- #FAKENEWS
Little reptillian man, crafting your propaganda for the media 2 revomit, lying to americans
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr You work for us, not Trump, not Bannon, not Preibus! Stop circumventing the democratic process!
America as we officially know it is OVER~ GONE @SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr @HouseDemocrats @TheDemocrats @NancyPelosi @DNC
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr Amen
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr Many will unite and remember with all due respect Senator Schumer.
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr Shut Liz Up!
Rule, rules rules. Next time bring a life witness.  Oh no. You can't; time past & you didn't show
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr once again chuckie you r setting urself 2 fail. I thought people in the grave are pretty silent
Every Democrat must read the letter. Force McConnell to redcard every last one of you.
@SenSchumer you should read it yourself. You are the leader lead.
Do you think Lyndon Johnson would have allowed that?
Why? Her letter does impugn Sessions motives unjustly? Can a civil rights icon NEVER make a mistake?
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr Hx will not be kind to @McConnel_leads what an embarrassment to America
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr yes
Why don't you cry and maybe someone will believe you. Not.
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr Too many fires to put out.  When will this nightmare end?  We can't live like this for 4 years.
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr Wrong! Let her Rest In Peace. Her letter is 31 yrs old and not relevant.
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr Shame on a leader who doesn't even promote freedom of speech on the senate floor. Unconstitutional!!
What the hell do democrats know about freedom of speech, have u seen riots lately.
Then again Fauxahantus brought up Senator Ted "The Killer" Kennedy. Remember Chappaquiddick and Mary Jo Kopechne.
Like hell she was.
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr You can't fight the GOP using moral grounds, something  they lack lately
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr  Mr McConnell sir you have showed exactly who you are!
@SenSchumer  Warren referred to him as a "disgrace" while quoting an old letter written by Coretta Scott King.
Stop Lying
No silencing a dishonorable Phony Indian casting false stones at honorable @SenatorSessions.
TRUE!
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr the Dems keep silencing the Founders so.....
how so?
McConnell just has a problem with references to people of color. He proved that with President Obama.
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr Washington has gone TRUMPCRAZY! I am terrified!
republicans just too low down for words.
@senschumer@dacullington.Mitch McConnell can't put "Baby in the corner"! Sessions will not stand up to Trump!
Is it because a woman read the letter? Is it because the writer was black? In any case, a disgrace!
Both ,If you do it to The senator what will you to me.
Well said. Thanks for speaking up. Next we will have our "rights to read" out loud taken away.
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr Let's mail the left to McConnell and to Jeff Sessions!!!!!
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr anything from the last 20-30 years to bring to the table? Or we living in the 70's and 80's still?
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr. Look where it got her.
Shameful and occuring Black History Month
My exact thought. Shameful.
how can they do that? Isn't that what we elect you all for, to speak for us?
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr from the grave? lmao
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr shame on you mr McConnell
#OccupyTheCapitol

And not for one night either. We need to get Romanian on these people.
And what do you intend to do about it?
your name is stolen from the Canadian broad cast
