:Bless you for continuing to honor and respect the True Americans and their sacred lands!
true Americans who drink away their lives and destroy their own land
:First YOU'RE TOTALLY WRONG!2nd I don't think you'd appreciate anyone making such a claim about the Irish!
they are
Yup and don't forget that Reservations are dumps
That's nice...Too bad he didn't work this hard for the past 8 yrs. Imagine what he could have accomplished, but he didn't
the republicans blocked everything he tried to do and we all know why
Really? Obama had control of both houses for 6 yrs and did nothing! Now you/he wants to cry? Stop!
wrong...he had control of both houses for 2 years. Republicans won the House in 2010
Sure it wasn't 2014 when the Republicans won both houses? I could be wrong, just saying...
not saying thats bad but factually Dems only had both chambers of congress from 08-10 when they passed Obamacare.
lol ok yeah if you go start when the new members were sworn in then it's 09-11(still 2 years)
#ThanksObama
Now pack the Courts with recess appts. And, if you could, recess appt yourself to SCOTUS
Ooooh... That's a great idea!  Justice Obama... has a good thing to it
Right! I think it would be great. I would love to see @MichelleObama on SCOTUS too.
Yes! Her experience and knowledge of the law, make her perfect!
Her vacations have given her unique perspective!She's perfect!
She is a Harvard trained lawyer w decades of legal experience.
And for the record, MO practiced law for 5 years.
Happy
@StandingRockST @POTUS *Obama STOP MANIPULATING THE PPLES* u know damn well u r abusing Aborigines $-land-Liberty-sovereignty *
@drdrewwilliams @POTUS Yep. Another government land grab! Area is rich all right. We see in SD what Obama thinks of Natives..
@Interior @POTUS he's not handing it over to the U.N. Is he?
shame on you for the ranchers lives u have destroyed!
.@WhiteHouse @POTUS  #LOL, photo of Bear Ears?  Really, you might try just visiting at least once. #OutOfTouch
Wonderful designations. Sadly, the AG of Utah has announced plans to fight Bears Ears in the interest of Big Oil.
@NatlParkService @POTUS please protect as much land as possible now!
Thanks President @BarackObama
wow 
protect from what , evil humans ?
In all fairness a working Death Star is so much cooler than national parks
love how you guys post arches and not the bears ears. real intelligent
@realDonaldTrump Trump should designate most of Hawaii a National Monument. Doesn't Illinois have ancient mounds?
will be undone on 20 January
Not so easily. You gotta go thru the courts first. Dubya learned tht quickly with Clinton's Roadless Rule
why?
If it was done with executive orders & not law, why can't it be reversed the same way?
He can try, but environmental orgs would sue like they did with the Roadless Rule. And they usually win.
Indeed
Hooray and thank you #POTUS #BarackObama for new national monuments #FindYourPark #peace
@USFWS @POTUS I love this President!! #ThanksObama
why?
@MartinHeinrich @POTUS Against the will of the people!
"against the will of the people" Didnt hear you bitching when Trump won, despite the will of the people
 U have not read the constitution! It is the electoral college that counts!
lmao you just contradicted yourself. One minute it's "about the people", the next you're "follow the rules exactly as written"
Not to mention, Westworld is located in there!:)
Get out of OUR WHITEHOUSE. Your finished. Stop messing with our country.
What about Standing Rock?
more land grabbing by Obama and the liberals. Outrageous!
TL TL
thank goodness! Trump's posse want to destroy land just for their personal profits. Thanks for protecting it.
Yep.. they wake up every morning thinking, "I want to destroy some of that environment stuff today". Please...
that's not the mindset. It's "if I sell this "useless" land, I could make some big bucks & can buy a new wife 
There are many legitimate issues to lament over. Why create imaginary ones?
This is good. We have lost too much great wilderness to development out here already.
thank you.  Missing you already. Just waiting for his impeachment.
thank you Mr. President!
Our Earthly 'Treasures' are breathtaking...
Great! Now return control over the 1851 Ft Laramie Treaty lands back to the Lakota, MHA tribes and all others involved!
thank you
@GregOnMoney @POTUS

Can we hunt and fish there?  Otherwise you aren't preserving anything, you are isolating it.
Now protect the Human Beings you've put in grave danger ... Snowden, Manning, US People + now Trump surveillance machine.
Thank you!!!!
awesome 
way to go! So glad that you did this, we need this for our children's heritage! Thank you!
#ThankyouObama
bravo! let us hope this does not get reversed by next administration.
So that's a no to @WestworldHBO?
thanks Trump so that l need the money to support my family
THANK YOU!!!!!!!!
great lets pull a PR stunt right after your betrayal of Israel.. this move is a joke
Great President Obama!
even the Chief Enemy of the State can do great things by mistake. 1st decent thing this piece of trash has done in 8 yrs.
The only reason Obama is doing this at this late stage is to tie the hands of energy exploration. No independence from Arabs.
already headed to the courts because you violated the law creating them!
There are many things that government can do better than the private sector. Preserving for the future is    nobel 
We call that stealing round here. Even when a government agent does it.
ya big dummy..wrong move..and it's not even the right picture!!
god bless Barak Obama. Please don't leave us. We need you.
Very well done! Now, if u could just squeeze in a No bear hunting & declassify them from 'game' status be4 u leave..xxxx
that land belongs to the state not the federal government they should not have done that specially Obama
If you're going to steal land from Utah, at least have brains enough to tweet out a correct photo. This is Arches. Idiots
Great - Now more government "protectors" will be added to the US (taxpayer) payroll to keep idiots safe from Themselves!
thanx
Thanks Obama!  @WhiteHouse @POTUS
@USFWS @POTUS Thank You!  #somebodycares
@summerflower29 @POTUS My backyard 
@CommerceGov @POTUS 
you mean more government control of the free space where farmers will be regulated or shot by the FBI
thank you again.
Food job Obama
I so hope that his actions stick and can't be reversed. I fear Trump, Ryan and McConnell will find a way, even illegally
thank you Mr President!
Bravo... Thank you @POTUS 
People with children and grandchildren should applaud you. PS I would have voted for you again
Massive Federal Government land grab continues. Feds already own more than 50% of the western US before this latest move.
thank you for everything you have done to protect our natural heritage, and for your leadership on climate change
Typical of B. Hussein and his thugs. Always ready to insult "We the People". Photo incorrect morons.
@whitehouseostp @POTUS It's about time ! 
Navajo land is sacred !
that's not even a picture of the area! That picture is in Arches National Park! #outoftouch
@TheBonnieRaitt @POTUS thank you ever so deeply
@ShaunKing Thank you for these National Monuments, @POTUS. Please do the same for #StandingRock.
@ShaunKing @POTUS @cenkuygur any chance we can get a story on his enviro work? May be helpful to see collectively
What a wonderful man!  We will miss you Mr President!
they're not protecting it...  they're reserving it so govt. can sell the mineral rights for foreign interests.  #wakeup
THANK YOU, MR PRESIDENT. 
he is simply trying to leave his mark... You know the one that doesn't hold him responsible for terrorism.
@ShaunKing @POTUS still being our President
they are so in tune with the environment they can't even get historical landmarks correct. ..O administration is so fake
Isis Leader Obama's latest private Property grab
Can DOOFUS screw this up when he crashes into the Whitehouse?

@aimlessgh0st
: We gave Pres @realDonaldTrump a magical pen & eraser on Nov 8th just 4 this purpose.If U say he cant then 4 sure he can.
what right Mr Obama do you have to usurp the rights of Utah & Nevada
Please confiscate say Manhattan or the LA Basin next.  Block all development to protect anything left.
but when is obamas face going on Rushmore tho...?
Go Obama ! We love it.
Another thing to applaud Barack Obama for! Thank you, Mr President. I'll miss you.
Legecy Gone 1/20/2017, thank GOD!
WOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO hope Standing Rock is next.
TR would be proud
Thank you, Mr. President!
Before you go, can you declare the coasts Trump-Free Zones? thanks.
The feds putting more land under there control doesn't really sit well...
Nothing sits well with those who lack the ability to reason. We're past that now
gorgeous!!! Thank you!!! Wish you would stay. Trump's a traitor who belongs in Prison.
I'm a Trump supporter, but agree with Obama on designating protected areas in Hawaii, Utah and Nevada.
Thanks Obama; would be nice if we did something to protect the native Americans and their land or was this their land ?
Standing Rock. Please, @Potus
Thank you, my President!
what about the Catskills? Allowing  that natural  gas line  in is a horrible  natural  disaster  in the making

Thank you Obama, preserving the natural beauty of the U.S. for future generations is imperative.... typical GOP haters
@ohuhbubb @POTUS Thank you Jesus! And PBO!!

thank you Obama!
@ginnykc @sawsharee @POTUS  Thank You! Can you do something with 'Thump Rock' now PLEASE? (Before Jan 30th) 

That would work BUT only on side if a mountain OR...... 
Camping. It's a nice place to camp.
Thank-you so much for loving our beautiful homeland!

Feds already own a big chunk of NV. What did they do with it? Nuked the hell out of it with a hundred bombs. #Sudan shot
this is what the Feds did to other NV land they took. Fix this first!
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_(nuclear_test) …
OK 
@MartinHeinrich @POTUS 
You mean, stealing land, don't you.

Awesome!!!
I'm for more monuments, but sick of "sacred sites"
@RambouilletAssn @POTUS Trying to accomplish something in the last month of an 8 year FLOP
don't let the facts get in the way. This country in far better condition than 8 years ago.
@deray What about the #theivingbundies?
Thank you, #POTUS !! (Please don't go!)
Oophs! Your clueless! This is a picture of Arches National Park which is over a hundred miles away from the Bears Ears!!
Even though we have no clue what they look like.
Closing our borders would also help the environment.
lol you want to wall off Canada, too?? How about the Gulf of Mexico? wall up around Trump hotels..
Haha. LOL. LOL, ROFL. Read something educational, ANYTHING, every once in a while.
Were you needing to say that to your mirror, cause it seems so. Build a wall around your room.
@NatlParkService @POTUS thx Obama, you are the greatest. Sad to see you go ... will visit this one in the coming years!
AND you get to stick it to a red state
Future home of Capitan Obammy's Islamic Terrorists training  facilities.....any bets?
