@WhiteHouse 66 arrested in America over ISIS and they include refugees http://dailym.ai/1OQhpGW  via @MailOnline
@SSReaney @WhiteHouse @MailOnline That article doesn't say that any of them were Syrian, so doesn't disprove anything in this chart.
@Schultzward OMG Ben don't be stupid! and don't contact me again! @WhiteHouse @MailOnline
@SSReaney Stop spewing hate and fear into the world. This is what the terrorists want. You're letting them win.
@Schultzward Geez Ben, way to rain on people's hate parade with your fancy "reason" and "logic"
@WhiteHouse Nice cherry picking. BTW, NO Japanese bombs hit the Pacific Fleet between 1 January 1781 and 7:47AM, December 7, 1941.
@darksecretplace @WhiteHouse Syrian conflict began in March 2011, so there weren't really any Syrian refugees before then. #ReadABook
@Schultzward @darksecretplace @WhiteHouse facts don't back that up
@jumba47 @darksecretplace Facts do, in fact, back up that the Syrian conflict began March 2011. You can #ReadABook too or just google it...
@Schultzward @darksecretplace I am talking about Syrian refugees coming here not about the conflict
@jumba47 VERY few, especially relative to current crisis. Many would've been better word. Point is @darksecretplace's comparison is not apt.
@Schultzward @jumba47 Larger point, however, is the use of refugees as cover is WAY more recent and chances are NONE til NOW.
@darksecretplace @jumba47 Refugee status is literally the most difficult to enter the country. We screen them while they're abroad.
@WhiteHouse using the word "Syrian" is misleading, especially when you omit the word ISLAM http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3322649/The-enemy-Nearly-SEVENTY-arrested-America-ISIS-plots-include-refugees-given-safe-haven-turned-terror.html#ixzz3rrEGpYx0 … http://www.hannity.com/articles/hanpr-war-on-terror-487284/heres-the-long-list-of-foreignborn-14135861/#ixzz3rrZhDrIP …
@SSReaney The "Syrian" refugee on the right is from former Soviet Union. & many "Islam Syrians" are Christians/other sects.  You're stupid.
@carolyncairo you fail to understand, they deliberately used the word "Syrian" not Muslim or Islam b/c there's no data for the FBI to use!
@SSReaney Huh?  Who deliberately uses Syrian?   What data does the FBI lack?  And why are you ignorning the Syrians who don't follow Islam?
@carolyncairo if you're not willing to educate yourself my telling you won't help, maybe if you watched Cspan more than MSN you'd understand
@SSReaney Typical of your ilk You can't even explain yourself -- have to try to insult someone instead.  I don't watch MSN.
@WhiteHouse What about the Boston bombers, the Somali fighters, the Chattanooga killer ?Deceit is your daily slogan
@WhiteHouse Tamarin and Dzokakar Tsarnaev were here for years before they did anything.  Timing..
@WhiteHouse @PatrickRothfuss for now
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse not true. Those Boston bombers were refugees. And a group in Louisiana already disappeared
@WhiteHouse Completely false. They aren't reporting their arrests as terrorist attacks.
@byaninek @WhiteHouse Refugees are causing trouble getting arrested?
Source please.
@wamp25 @WhiteHouse http://woundedamericanwarrior.com/70-isis-scumbags-arrested-in-usa-can-you-guess-how-many-were-obamas-refugees/ …
@byaninek @Freedom_Daily it says openly it's a CONSERVATIVE news outlet.

I need something that isn't pushing an ideological narative.
@WhiteHouse @jimmacpam ISIS wins the war with 10 radicals and changes the worlds policy and incites fear everywhere. Shut down all.?

@WhiteHouse If we don't bring them in, we don't have to worry about it!
@WhiteHouse FACT: ISIS wants us to start each sentence with "FACT:" Do not give in to these monsters!!
@WhiteHouse when you classify terrorist acts as workplace violence, no one believes anything you say.
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse Muslim haters are doing what IS want. America should stand steadfast for its ideals. That's how we can defeat terrorism.
@WhiteHouse What about all the ones that have slipped through our unsecured borders? Where are those numbers?
@WhiteHouse OH GOODIE! SO LET THE MONEY STOLEN FROM YOUR PAY CHECK FOR SS BE USED TO BUILD THEM A HOME IN THEIR COUNTRY, NOT MY BACK YARD!
@WhiteHouse I'm sure the Syrians are totally different than the Iraqis... http://articles.latimes.com/2011/may/31/nation/la-na-kentucky-terror-arrests-20110601 …
@WhiteHouse Shush, facts don't matter to the anti-refugee mob!
@WhiteHouse Fact:  Zero Syrian refugees have been resettled in Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Iran........

Today is #WorldRefugeeDay. 
How much $$ has Saudi government given to the Clinton Foundation?
Facts>Fear Driven Emotion RT@WhiteHouse: FACT: 0 Syrian refugees arrested or removed on terrorism charges. ”
@Calsparks1 @WhiteHouse Keep drinking the Kool Aid and bowing to our king.
@suspensewriter7 @Calsparks1 @WhiteHouse coming from a trump/Carson sheepie
@suspensewriter7 glad to know you are a writer. Won't be buying your books
@jumba47 I don't want you to buy them.
@WhiteHouse This article claims "nearly 70" have been arrested in the US over in the last 18 months. Please explain? http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3322649/The-enemy-Nearly-SEVENTY-arrested-America-ISIS-plots-include-refugees-given-safe-haven-turned-terror.html …
@CoachGameplay @WhiteHouse the article refers mainly to Bosnian refugees. Shall we start digging up the WWII anti jew refugee articles too??
@StrangeLondon @WhiteHouse You honestly think allowing in thousands of fighting-aged men from a hostile nation we can't even vet is *smart*?
@CoachGameplay @WhiteHouse not a hostile nation. ISIS doesn't even represent majority of muslims or islam.  Not every muslim is a jihadi
@StrangeLondon @WhiteHouse I suggest *you* do some research. Because at this point you're just embarrassing yourself. Good luck.
@CoachGameplay @WhiteHouse why? Cause i am human and have compassion and empathy for people that IS is killing?
@WhiteHouse that's good,  but not good enough.  Why did 5 Syrians With fake Greek passports try to get in to this country??
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse It is simple to convict one for murder and leave out the word terrorism we also know what BS stands for
@WhiteHouse Was this after you drew the line in the sand?
@WhiteHouse @satishkolls Start packing them Up !!
@WhiteHouse give it up. Americans don't believe you have their best interest in mind. They don't trust you. For good  fact based reasons.
@WhiteHouse. boo. Help our inner cities first!!!
@WhiteHouse @Lompemann OK good news,heart says let them come,but my brain ( and body parts) say fuck no! Let them live in the whitehouse
@WhiteHouse :  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans …
@WhiteHouse  I trust my President. So far so amazing. The greatest. I am comforted by his genius leadership and humanity #itrustObama
@WhiteHouse France was attacked but still they're taking in 30,000 refugees.The US was not attack but commit to 10,000&they criticize POTUS?
@WhiteHouse Even when presented with facts they are still in disbelief... #benightedfolks
@WhiteHouse @MartinHeinrich 
Huh, does that mater to anybody that was killed? Nope.
@WhiteHouse Not even a busted tail light?
@WhiteHouse none of the French terrorists would show on this list either....
@WhiteHouse so far....
@WhiteHouse Only proves you haven't caught anyone yet...
@WhiteHouse If ISIS is contained, then why bring refugees?
@WhiteHouse #Let me say here that no Syrian born refugees is a trait but they have mixed multitudes following them.
@WhiteHouse so they never will?
@WhiteHouse The attacks in France just happened a couple days ago. Now u need to keep track of this, in case sleepers already got in. Duh.
@WhiteHouse Fact, the Boston bombers were "refugees".
@WhiteHouse yet
@WhiteHouse or they haven't been caught
@WhiteHouse he said the Department of Justice was going to help me you live
@WhiteHouse creating you said the Department of Defense will help me you lied
@WhiteHouse @JulianRoepcke 24776 = Number or Syrian refugees seeking asylum in Sweden during the last two months.
. @WhiteHouse Stupid is as stupid does. #GOP wrong about everything, and damn proud of it! #VoteBlue #VoteOutGOP #UniteBlue
@WhiteHouse @JulianRoepcke Well, thats about the number which arrives in Munich on a single busy Weekend alone. Not much of a Statistic.
Uh, @WhiteHouse, the Paris attackers weren't arrested either.
@WhiteHouse just takes one
@WhiteHouse France didn't have to deport any Syrians before Nov. 13 either.
@WhiteHouse like this administration is going to act on anything
@WhiteHouse @michaelscherer good so there's no danger with settling all the rest in DC
@WhiteHouse @ZachHesselbarth
@ZachHesselbarth all I'm hearing from you is fear... We have to stop judging entire groups of people. Don't let the terrorists win!
@WhiteHouse NO NO NO. Take care of us first dang it. Two jobs and still barely making ends meet, no thank you to refugees
.@txlove34 @WhiteHouse NO NO NO. Take care of us first dang it. Two jobs and still barely making ends meet, no thank you to humans
@WhiteHouse unfortunately facts never get in the way of the GOP
@WhiteHouse yup facts huh
@WhiteHouse well there's always the first time
@WhiteHouse yet
@WhiteHouse Obama's evil agenda has been thwarted, at least for the moment. Next step is the Senate.
@WhiteHouse http://youtu.be/XHr07DYO6gA 
@WhiteHouse probably not because you are too worried about arresting police officers for doing their job
@WhiteHouse BOSTON BOMBERS were refugees given citizenship
@WhiteHouse immigration isn't the answer: http://youtu.be/LPjzfGChGlE 
OOPS! Two Syrian families turn themselves in at Texas border town http://www.rawstory.com/2015/11/two-syrian-families-turn-themselves-in-at-texas-border-town/ … @WhiteHouse
@upayr What exactly is your pint here? Nothing connected to terrorism in this case.
Yes, FREE PASS to people who enter country ILLEGALLY. BTW, if you HATE FACTS, move on.  @MouldyKitten #BLOCK
@WhiteHouse @DavidADemarest
@WhiteHouse   They will be
@WhiteHouse but they come here and get everything handed to them when our own people are homeless!
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  how many wounded warriors returning from war who've fought for the liberties, we now enjoy have you resettled?
@WhiteHouse @Goldman44 I'm guessing you won't be releasing numbers regarding illegal immigrants and crime? #justsayin
@WhiteHouse  Why don't u spend your time convincing Muslim countries to take Muslim refugees instead of demonizing half of the America
@WhiteHouse Nice propaganda. Which progressive in the WH made the chart?
@suspensewriter7 @WhiteHouse do ur own research and find out the truth
@WhiteHouse does that include the 8 recently apprehended attempting to cross our border ILLEGALLY?  You realize the were ARRESTED! Liers!
@WhiteHouse Our Citizens need help first
@WhiteHouse Good. Let's keep it that way.
@WhiteHouse France would argue to be cautious and to reconsider. There numbers were similar last week. "God bless France
@WhiteHouse Isis will take advantage, please put our safety first, take care of our urban citizens first!
.@WhiteHouse  "Zero" - And we have what reason to believe anyone in this administration?  Remember: "You can keep your doctor, period!"
@WhiteHouse I call bullshit
@WhiteHouse But NOW is when terrorists have infiltrated.
@WhiteHouse @Goldman44 Why do we need any refugees. No speak English, wrong religion,  lazy violent- and you're not paying for them, we do
@WhiteHouse Legitimate question: How many had been arrested or removed on terrorism charges in France prior to the Paris attacks?
@WhiteHouse @SenatorLeahy WHEN THEY HIT AMERICA YOU WILL DO WHAT ? TELL US MORE LIES ? TELL US ITS OUR FAULT BECAUSE WE ARE RACIST ? RESIGN
@WhiteHouse What are the chances of their kids become radicalized in the future? #Obama don't do this to your people.
@WhiteHouse The TRUTH about the @BarackObama administrations past failures on background check from @ABC News
@WhiteHouse oh you and your propaganda

@WhiteHouse @TonyGalvao_
@WhiteHouse That's just great! Now not only will you let them in, you won't be arresting them for any crimes so as not to ruin your numbers
@WhiteHouse Yet.
@WhiteHouse いろいろ有るんだね？何とか成らないの？
@WhiteHouse In the words of Bob Dylan, "Times they are a changin."  Wake up!
@WhiteHouse  lies all lies that what are government is a bunch of liars
@WhiteHouse That's 406.8 Syrians on average per FY. Way more realistic and manageable than the 10k+ you are pushing for now.
@WhiteHouse so far.
@WhiteHouse christians are a PoS, christians murdered more innocent people than any other religion on earth.
@WhiteHouse what about the refugee in Louisiana that fled and was found in another state? Can't keep track of one what about thousands?
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse So??? So what? That makes everyone seeking refugee status in US clear of being potential threat? #RIDICULOUS
@WhiteHouse I believe that power has gone to your head Obama and your flexing your authority and not thinking about Americans.
@WhiteHouse we are not surprised that you're going to veto house bill you've been playing unfair for sometime now against republicans.
@WhiteHouse fact, Boston?
@WhiteHouse oh I forgot he doesn't like us Americans. We need Republican for president 8 years of democratic is too much
@WhiteHouse Do you see there are 50% of Americans that do not want this Obama.
@WhiteHouse http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/06/09/ig-report-tsa-failed-to-identify-73-potential-terrorists-trying-to-get-access/ …
@WhiteHouse the Muslims here are not speaking up against Isis
@WhiteHouse facts, something republicans don't have
@akheathen69 @WhiteHouse @MailOnline IF it were fact none hv bn arrested, it's only because the Fed government is not doing their jobs!
@schwabre @WhiteHouse And that is something new?
@WhiteHouse we do not want a country full of Muslims. And the good ones here are speaking up against Isis.
@WhiteHouse I am definitely voting republican because I feel democrats are not going to keep us safe. Obama has changed the face of America
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse You shoild be educating people on our long standing U.S.. Refugee:admittance program Most don't know its been in place all along
@WhiteHouse Did you not hear how 5 Syrians were arrested yesterday at our boarder with fake ID Obama? What is your issue?
@WhiteHouse so much stupidity coming out of the WH these days.  It's unbelievable.
@WhiteHouse If 1 American is killed by any of these refugees @POTUS should be criminally charged for there death
@WVCV2303 @WhiteHouse @POTUS I agree!
@WhiteHouse doesn't mean they aren't out there. It's not like we are talking unicorns and leprechauns.
@mblairwinters @WhiteHouse LOL!
@WhiteHouse Mr. Obama listen to the American people do not want these migrants here in USA. How come you dislike Americans so much Obama?
@WhiteHouse yet. http://www.hannity.com/articles/hanpr-war-on-terror-487284/heres-the-long-list-of-foreignborn-14135861/#ixzz3rrZhDrIP …
@WhiteHouse Nobody listens to you. You have zero credibility. And this is clearly propaganda. Not fooling anyone.
@WhiteHouse can't do a proper vetted person without boots on ground we need intelligence collection 1st don't bring them yet.
@WhiteHouse  I don't hear any condemnation of terror attacks in Israel.  Is there a problem with your thinking?
@WhiteHouse Any chance to avoid contrived controversy. Solutions don't come without planning, effort, and luck (2/2)
@WhiteHouse will you stake your jobs on this ? Will Obama resign immediately if the us is attacked?
@WhiteHouse Wrong! We want to know the vetting process! And how many the Obamas, Kerry's, and Clintons are taking in?
@angelathomas22 @WhiteHouse They also have room at the Vatican.  Go there!
@WhiteHouse So, let's settle them in your neighborhood.
@WhiteHouse All lies!
@WhiteHouse Is that fact supposed to put my mind at ease? Sorry I'm not feeling it.
@WhiteHouse http://www.barenakedislam.com/2015/09/16/saudi-official-says-they-are-deliberately-ignoring-refugees-to-accelerate-spread-of-islam-in-the-west/ …. #terrordeniers
@WhiteHouse More than half of Americans refuse refugees. We are scared, but you insist we accept them. It's about the people, our security!
@YourBoyRyan @WhiteHouse Not scared.  Resolved.  We ALL stand together and things get done.  They divide. @netanyahu called it out clearly.
@WhiteHouse Get over it, the people don't want them here.
@WhiteHouse FACT:  They're still not white and Christian. That means they're terrorists. QED
@the_real_Lord @WhiteHouse another lie.  THEY ARE COMMITTING GENOCIDE against WHITES AND CHRISTIANS.  OUR BLOOD TASTES BETTER, SO THEY SAY
@WhiteHouse THAT WAS THEN, THIS IS NOW!
