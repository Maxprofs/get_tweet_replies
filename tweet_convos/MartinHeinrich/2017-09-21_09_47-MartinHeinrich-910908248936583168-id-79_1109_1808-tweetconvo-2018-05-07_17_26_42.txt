Real bipartisan solutions to fix our health care system are within reach if Pres Trump & Rs would be willing to work with us to find them
Rs need to remember that real people’s lives hang in the balance in this #TrumpCare debate. Share your story here: http://bit.ly/2sPRD0u 
@pegbreault and her @OFA_NM Vols for working this week to #ProtectOurCare
I will work to send home anyone who does repeal the harmful Obamacare
Dear Sir,  Do you pay for your Family's health insurance?  If so what are monthly premiums?  Please share, it will give me prospective
@Kathryn78727
Listen to Martin Heinrich .. Our health Care can be saved.
And come January 2018 when we all get royally screwed by the insurance companies who will take things into their own hands.
Where's your healthcare proposal?
Unfortunately, I DON'T have any power, because @SenatorBurr @SenThomTillis don't give a rip how evil #GrahamCassidy is! We should just die 
No we shouldn't. They should be out of office. We're not going to die because of their greed
Well okay, but I meant @SenatorBurr @SenThomTillis would rather their constituents just die than get the guts to care. Tillis needs to WAKE!
We have to get money out of politics. It's eroding the moral fortitude of the Republican party.
Great
We are calling. Are you?
No.  I will not.  Get rid of Obama care
What I fail 2 understand is why so many Republicans r voting 4 #Trumpcare - do they REALLY think is a good bill 4 their states?I’m confused.
Puerto Rico now. I beg you.
Martin, don't you think "we the people" need to cut down; that over 22% are on welfare and cost 1 trillion a yr for this program?
Medicare for all.
What do you say to this Senator:
Oh go sit in your hat
This is very nice.  Thank you Senator!
If the bill passes it's because the senate is weak, afraid to stand up to the pres for what is right and just plain want it off their desk.
Do you REALLY want to ride it out til OBAMACARE totally fails? Dems had their chance, they BLEW it.
Yes but why are so many senators focused on hurting their constituents.  AARP, AMA and so many others have actually read bill and hate it.
Thank you, Senator, for looking out for your constituents—even those who don’t recognize the good you do.
Millions will be left w/o insurance don't accept the @GOP plan as it will leave millions with out #healthcare
This guy is full of it. 
I think these shows are all written by the ancient aliens writers. Connecting dots to other dots they make up...

2/2 use Drs w/bad credentials or nurses.  Like UK, we will wait 10 mos 4 biopsy. Dr's already deny Medicare patients even w/supplemental ins
1/2 Gov will give U free HC, but it won't resemble current HC, it will resemble UK.  Wealthy will B treated by Dr's in pvt practice, we will
And send emails!!
5/5 20yrs after screening?  Did UK cull Pop w/contamtn?  Finally, UK announced prohibitive cost of free HC forced them 2 deny, obese (30BMI)
4/5 Y not use "free" doctors?  No disease/partner control?  UK lost 2400 Hemophiliacs 2 AIDS tainted blood.  How does this happen 2 so many,
3/5  Must we legislate "accountability", yes!  UK has free HC.  They also have AIDS epidemic.  Offer AIDS test kits in vending machines?  Y
2/5 rejoice, consider the free HC of Veterans Admn.  Pres Trump had to intervene to rescue our vets.  Passed Accountability & Choice Acts.
1/5 Dems no longer try to save AHC.  They know this was never an option.  You R being manipulated into single payer HC, free HC.  Before you
Thank you Senator for your tireless work to protect Americans and New Mexico!
ACTIVATE ANTIFA FORCES!!!!! DESTROY DESTROY DESTROY!!!!!!!
Healthcare for all is ACA.  Healthcare for people who hate @BarackObama is Obamacare.  Senators need to vote for PEOPLE not party posturing.
You said ask physicians about #ACA 
U should listen 2 UR own advice & ask Dr. @RandPaul what he thinks.
#FullRepeal
Thank you for taking a stand for New Mexico. I'm glad I voted for you.
If only! Republicans on a mission to strip healthcare so they will get all the $$.We have no control over their greed. But will keep calling
No, quit propagating the lie that is Obamacare. I have friends that lost their insurance and doctors. And my premiums are going up.
Thank you for continuing to stand for us!
Do you think ACA is sufficient and why? And if not, what are you proposing we should do to change it?
Hope you have amendments to jam this thing up via "paper filibuster" since reconciliation per rule must allow unlimited amendments.
So proud of our Congress! Keep passing laws we can’t afford in the first place! Why don’t you fall under ACA for coverage? Hmmmm
We must call. We must tweet, text, email, and write. We must act, act with purpose and unity. We have two weeks. Take a STAND!
I've tried Dean Hellers office most of the morning...bet he took his phone off the hook... no prob with all the others.
You Democrats want communist healthcare. Why don't you admit it? U will not stop until you have ruined this country. Obama is a Communist.
#Kochs pledge 400M to repeal #Obamacare so @SenateGOP kick 32M of the roles

400M/32M = $12.50

Your LIFE is only worth $12.50 to the @GOP
Martin, think 2020
Call and call again
Sen. Heinrich, as your constituent, thank you for standing up for us.
What call on antifa to put a bat to somones head. You guys sure like to insight riots. The left is the most hateful group I know.
An estimated two million more people will decline the costly “affordable” coverage, and the ACA is expected to increase premiums by 18%.
Stop the Hitler care  (Obama care )it's nothing but Dictatorship. This is the USA not Russia or N Korea. You all are about follow the dollar
Thank you Senator Heinrich. We, in New Mexico, are so proud to have you as our Senator!
