Please, stop them!  They've used 'Dead on Arrival' to discourage opponents from protesting.  Can't let it happen!
It's going to happen. So get over it. We had to live with this socialist Obamacare for 8 yrs. #SupportYourself
Wow giving Americans Healthcare is socialist other every other OECD COUNTRY BUT US HAVE HEALTHCARE
we have healthcare. You just have to pay your own way. Like the rest of us do.
people do want to pay their own way.. that's why we need AFFORDABLE care
Your killing me
Affordable to who? Me? Trump? you? I want a $500,000 car more affordable to me. Ain't happening.
He sees the Deep divide between us
 I'm desperately Seeking common ground
Give me something here
no your not. You want others to pay for you to have something. My money isn't yours to have.
Kind of like how the Dems passed Obamacare. Yet not a word from you. What a joke.
If you really believe that then why did you shove #Obamacare down our throats? #Trumpcare #Hypocrite
@SenateDems so can u tells us what r the Democrats gking 2 do 2 stop them
@SenateDems please, please help us. I am a 61 old old on SSD with many health issues!! We are begging you to help us!!
Please give us the same healthcare coverage members of Congress receive. Single-payer would be best, but we'll take yours.
U either came up with $1,200 for a root canal or you lost your tooth
Was so happy to sign up to buy insurance for 1st time
I can't understand why people claim to be for America but are against Americans
Growing up I could not buy dental ins
Seriously, why don't you step down and face your indictment like a man #take responsibility #DoTheRightThing
They aren't trying to make sense. They just want to disrupt and degrade our democracy.
@SenateDems Black voters getting off @DNC Plantation  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N1WwhwPyLA&sns=tw …  @POTUS
But, they are going to get the score from the CBO while working to improve the Bill. What's your problem?
One thing we know for sure is that the ACA has to go because it is failing. Work to fix the AHCA!
You Democrats pushed thru an imperfect ACA. Now, be non-partisan and fix the AHCA for us.
@SenateDems They don't want people to know #TrumpCare #LiarInChief #MakeAmericaSmartAgain
They don't care as long as 45 can make his weekly visits to Florida.
@MartinHeinrich sound familiar? You wanted to do the same back in 09. We got a really "great" deal when it passed. NOT!
THEY DO EVERYTHING UNDERHANDED AND BACKWARDS.  FUHRER TRUMP DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE JUST THE RICH
@SenateDems
Don't be sellouts like Lieberman
If you don't vote down this WALL stop this castration of Obamacare b voted out
It makes perfect sense. It was a tax cut for the Rich...who cares about the rest?
@SenateDems NO, NO, NO!
Please stand firm on this.
Thank you senator!
@watchyourRepsNJ thank you Senator and please, please, PLEASE keep fighting for us!!!

Hop on board @RepTomMacArthur!
Please speak Out Senator
Thanks.
#BlockTrumpCare
Stupid blind determination to undo anything done - not just by Dem - but by a black Dem. Shameful hypocritical racist @GOP.
@SenateDems offer an alternative (Single payer). For once spurn the DNC and fight for progressive values!
It's not called Trumpcare. It is called American Health Care and I shouldn't be telling you this.
just removing the alternate benefit plans on Medicaid would strip half of the funding from addiction facilities in NJ!
@SenateDems  your voters don't pay for anything anyways.  Now you guys care ???? Stick to the Russian story.
Simply preposterous! Please continue to stand up for us! @SenatorMenendez
The rush is because the Stupidparty-Republicans know trumps  about to be impeached.
@SenateDems Democrats passed Obamacare and told everyone to read it afterwards
@SenateDems of course it makes sense!  They are Republicans!!!!
@SenateDems sounds familiar
what a jerk you are bob
Tell that to Nancy Pelosi! You're a hypocrite!
Me imagino que dicha acción lleva un estudio que justifique la propuesta, debe existir una causa y la previsión de efectos
@SenateDems Please make sure this bill doesnt go through.It's not worth it&what's the rush?No more mistakes like Travel Ban
@SenateDems expose to Americans their healthcare. THEY want to give us garbage while they enjoy free healthcare.
@SenateDems Why are you all not moving for impeachment? We all feel like this is a bad dream that will not go away!
@speakerryan  ryan  in 2009 opposing the passing of Pres.Obama healthcare bill #NoScoreNoVote CBO
@MartinHeinrich Hypocrites!  Hang tough on your opposition!
It's the middle class n the insured that got screwed by Obamacare.
@SenateDems Your Nancy Pelosi stated during Obamacare that they needed to pass it BEFORE they could read it. Responsible?
Live in NJ had Obamacare for a year and it sucked ans was expensive. NJ DIDNT set anything to help. Give GOP a try
your under indictment yourself right melendez????? so you might go to jail to?? right??
that was pelosi own words. what we didnt read it, just pass it then we will read it. so that ok right. g t f out
you all nuts down there, time to replace all that has been in office more then 2 terms. o-care you said pass it first,
@Tina5545Tina exactly. Senseless but not cents less!
@SenateDems This just shows that we the people are not considered in any of the R agenda. Will do everything to flip seats.
They're obsessed with destroying Obama's legacy. Racial or because he is a Dem? They don't care if it kills people #EVIL
@SenateDems   What are they hiding?
@SenateDems This makes absolutely no sense. Taxpayers will not only pay more for ins but also the cost of implementation.
keep up the good fight, this is too important a decision to not use facts.
@dolphsteelbear  please make sure this doesn't go through!
@ElianaT_CA It makes sense if you don't want the people it will impact the most understand what it will take from them.
@SenateDems Sound familiar?  At least they will know what is in it
@SenateDems "We have to pass the bill to find out what's in it."
Democrats pass without even reading it. Breathe and let Trump work his magic. Good for America, Bad for the Swamp #MAGA
..Does anything Republicans do make sense..their motto, "have mercy on the RICH".
This is my daughter, Annie McKee. She has Crohn's Disease. Healthcare is a matter of life and death for her. #SavetheACA
Sure it does, it's about destroying the ACA. Repeal was their only goal,replace was an issue forced upon them.
How many Americans will lose coverage while those creating this bill will continue with taxpayer paid benefits.
@SenateDems To them, this plan is the next best thing to no plan, which is what they'd prefer.
@SenateDems Senator, Republicans make no sense!
just as ludicrous as Sen. Pelosi saying "we need to pass Obamacare to find out what's in it". Double standards
@GOP doesn't care about making sure their constituents are cared for. They want tax breaks for rich donors.

@SenateDems that's ok. They'll figure a way to blame Obama for that.  Buck never stops with them.
@SenateDems #resist #Trumpcare SUCKS
Sense and Republicans don't belong in the same sentence unless it's to show an oxymoron.
@SenateDems no we really don't. This is as crappy as Obamacare
just effin parroting others! Eff all u just interested in how it affects u getting reelected rude awake comin
@SenateDems
@SenateDems and Spicer condemning CBO today was a ploy.
Under no circumstances should #Trumpcare pass it will intentionally denie healthcare to those that need it most while increasing cost "Sick"
@SenateDems just block it
check your attorney general firing everyone
so what are you! Doing about it
Why can't we ask Canada for advice? http://www.canadian-healthcare.org/page2.html 
i known now i want you to do something about it
45 likes this being called #Trumpcare. He had nothing to do with it. "Credit"belongs to @SpeakerRyan Blame him  #Ryancare
anything under a trillion dollars per year will be an improvement
Senator the President is a danger to the Republic
insane. Please stop them. Thank you! Your constituent.
Pls. don't call it Trumpcare. It reminds me of Obamacare....yikes!
Really? So, 'splain your vote for #Obamacare, then.
Incrementally, inefficiently, and at far greater expense than what we already had.
@randyprine Especially since Ryan DEMANDED the same for the ACA.
@SenateMajLdr @CoryBooker this should not be allowed to go forward. It will hurt d ppl, but perhaps that's what d Reps want
when politics Trump the publics wellbeing.
well stop them !!
should sound familiar to you dem bozos, that's what you did with the pile of known as ACA! Hypocrites!
Need I remind you Dems passed Obamacare before they knew what was in it as per then speaker Pelosi See how that turned out?
STOP WITH THE POLITICS AND GET SOMETHING DONE!!!
It looks like a typical GOP ploy to redistribute wealth to the richest Americans. The working class is harmed severely!
All due respect, Republicans are not about sense.
Don't let the GOP demons harm the ppl!
sounds exactly like what dems did when Obamacare passed. HEY POT, IM A KETTLE!!!
Please don't call it tRumpcare. Call it RepublicanCare & make GOP own it in 2018 & 2020. It's will be a disaster & Repubs will lose bigly
but you were a part of, "you have to pass a bill before you see it". Step up legislate, do not pontificate and obstruct.
it makes no sense at all!! #wealthcare
Trouble is, if nothing is done, O-Care still goes away.
100% agree. Makes no more sense now then it did when you guys passed Obamacare.
Senator we see how accurate CBO was with assessing the AHCA. You passed it before we could see what was in it. No Repubs!
Alt-Fiscal Conservatism!
Kinda like the Dems passing Obamacare without reading it. ( Nancy Pelosi) how soon the forget.
@PrincessBravato Gee, Senator, there's a fucking shocker. @gop making asinine policy w/o public input? Whoda thunk it.
blackmail,gold in their pockets, revenge obama, a desire to kill Americans r your only options to rushing that idiotic bill
You hit the nail right on the head.
No, it does not make any sense. You are in a position to do something so PLEASE STOP THIS.
Best way for Putin to ensue countless Americans die.
@RepDonBeyer Sir, can they be stopped or slowed down? The GOP health bill, employers and genetic testing. Scared here.
They condemned Obamacare but just wait..."Concare" will be in effect and they can't blame Obama for it!!! but...#DontheConwillfindawayto
Republican hypocrisy is as American as apple pie and baseball.
Oh you mean like the Patriot Act the 500-page document that they gave two hours to vote on
I bet we won't have to pass it to find out what is in it! BTW did you vote for ACA?
Senator that is why kids cannot sit at the adult table
yeah, but they are repealing dude. That's the important part #MakeAmericaSickAgain
Dude, Trump is president, we are in  post making sense times...
