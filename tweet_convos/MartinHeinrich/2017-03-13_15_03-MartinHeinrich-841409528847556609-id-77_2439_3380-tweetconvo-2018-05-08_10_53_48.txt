SolutionEVERY JOB IN AMERICA PAYS THE SAME! SOCIALISM AT ITS FINEST we can call it HEINRICHISM!
I nominate #TrumpCare for oxymoron of the year, along with president trump. @MartinHeinrich @KarmaRocks1
@MarkRuffalo USA and #healthcare  good joke.
please don't call it Trump care. This is an embarrassment all Republicans need to share. Call it #Republicare.
@NoHolidayforGOP @MartinHeinrich Call it#Republiscam! #VoteOutGOP#TrumpRussiaCollusion #Trumputin#FuckTrumpSupporters#NoWay
Could not be worse than Obamacare where a disabled person living on SSDI pays twice as much for half the care.
I pay very little for Medicare + Advantage plan, but get excellent care.
Tiny little West Texas town.
@btach2014
I am a Special Education teacher. For me and my three children on health insurance with my district now: $1500/mo

@MarkRuffalo absolutely the is greasing the palms of the wealthy,he's Robin Hood in reverse,takes from poor,gives to rich
it's a seven figure tax break
@BadassTeachersA I thought most teachers are covered by group health plan. Can you cite the plan section that shows this?
solution, free healthcare to teachers + new teacher pay scale= to teacher skills and output pay them better, keep the best!
yes it does and if over 50 it goes up as you get older.  A 62 year old could end up paying $14,000,
under ACA $1700
it's actually #trumpDONTcare... I don't even think he understands it
@POTUS @SenateGOP #liarinchief
hedge fund & equity trust two different startups. Arrest frauds. All women all white skin. Blacks arrive media
thats just not right. You all need to block this leg and the Govs also need to chime in. Esp Ky Wi Oh Mi WVa.
why does a hedge fund manager make more money, he chose a high risk high reward job, pay = to choice.
Teachers have retirement, small business owners go broke, layoff employees, employees become wards of the state Obamacare!
AML+FLT3+19yo+>$1M in bills+prex condition=ty #aca for saving my baby's life #coveragematters #the27% #repeal1stkills
@ShaunKing Sad part is more like more middle American school teachers voted for Trump than hedge fund managers 
@EmilyFuhrman Ain't America great under Trump. The rich get richer & can afford Trimp club fees.  Poor? Well ur poor so ...
@magsgworks I hope they are happy once their tax break becomes pay for a billionaire, they lost healthcare & kid got cancer.
from a schoolteacher.
The sad realty is this doesn't bother GOP at all, INCREDIBLE!! Poor schmucks gravitate to them for what???
What the...
@HRepeating Did I mention, millions will lose all their coverage.
A teacher who If a woman won't be paid equally to male colleagues.
A teacher who If a woman isn't paid equally to her male colleagues.
Except teachers get paid on a step guide?
Trump said it was priced into your vote.
Be honest H-care is negotiated by unions. Substitute teachers getting full pention,h-care retirement & 50.00hr subbing fact
Subs don't make $50 hour lol
Go read Obama care.

Trump will renege on his promise to end the carried interest scam, like all his promises,they are for sale.
as a retired teacher that infuriates me.
for once, you actually make sense. This new health plan is garbage. Why not reach across the isle and help craft legislation
@GuthrieGF The GOP r swindling crooks who r experts at highway robbery
work covered insurance got worse due to Obamacare.  Where were you when millions of Americans' were taken advantage of then?
again..that was because of Repub leaders who did everything to block their constituents from benefitting
Do something right! Why not put forth legislation that Congress  be subject to the same health care as those you represent??
I can't even get a 6-finure incomeâ€¦ what must that be like??
ask Marin H. He's above is.  Gets great Healthcare AND lines his pockets!
Martin. Sorry for the typo.

@amjoyshow Paying attention Trump voters?  Is this why you voted for Trump? Voting against your own interests is a bad idea.
@SheilaDecker19 -Makes perfect sense to gutless GOP
@ShaunKing Thank you for having half a brain.
-_- a school teacher would have insurance THROUGH THE SCHOOL SYSTEM! OBAMA CARE DOESNT WORK OUR INSURANCE KEEPS GOIN UP
@JasonKander as if Bobby Axelrod of Axe Capital needed more money
#Trumpcare is a bad prescription for Americans oppose #DonTheCon
@All100Senators EXACTLY!! @SenCoryGardner stands for #MakeTheRichEvenRicher #GOPNoCare insur co's corporate welfare!!
@fangpusskins good, I was really worried hedge fund mgr's. would have to give up vacation homes!!
@JasonKander makes sense.
Priorities!
@JasonKander used to be the one thing teachers could count on, affordable great coverage.  Every yr I pay more and get less.
@JasonKander @HouseDemocrats and @SenateDems - why aren't you screaming this everywhere and every second???
duh.. why would we want the lower income people to amass financial independence..
Absolutely unacceptable!
@JasonKander all due respect, trump doesnt care abt public teachers. He'd rather they be unemployed, Devos nom made it clear
@JasonKander definitely not way should be.Trump's actions help trump & those who don't need it-not those who do. Disgusting
@JasonKander Ouch. I'm a school teacher.

Congressional Budget Office confirms: #AHCA will cause 24 million to lose insurance while richest get $274 billion tax break #CBO #Trumpcare 
dude,that's a feature not a bug for Dolt 45,Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell
@JasonKander @jasoninthehouse not interested in asking what sacrifice hedge fund managers have made for ACA.
Making America Great Again!
@PolitiFact can you check this?
or a health care CEO will get huge bonus'
