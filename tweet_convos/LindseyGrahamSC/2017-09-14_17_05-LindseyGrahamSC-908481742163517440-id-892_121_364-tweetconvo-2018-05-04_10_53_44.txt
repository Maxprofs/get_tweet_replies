You are trying to cause the mass death of Americans to give rich people tax cuts.

Stop lying, and stop trying to deny people medical care.
This proposal is a nitemare. Gutting Medicaid, no protection for pre existing conditions, premiums skyrocket...vote no @SenCoryGardner
'airheads of Congress will keep their plush healthcare plan - the rest of us guinea pigs who will be thrown to the wolves.' Camille Paglia
Please run out of time. Graham-Cassidy is a mean-spirited, terrible bill that will hurt millions. Why are you trying so hard to hurt people?
Go to you know where and take your flip flopping attitude with you.
Have you come out of the closet yet? Is your boyfriend in agreement with killing folks by eliminating their healthcare?
#MedicareForAll
Shame!  You know this is going to devastate our most vulnerable citizens.
Senator Graham..this proposed health legislation seriously is NOT good at all. More uninsured, premiums can be raised at anytime by company!
As soon as you all actually start doing something. Y'all are about as useless as a screen door on a submarine.
This isn't hard. Give us the same #Healthcare plan congress has. See how easy that is?
No No No
We don't want this. You are a monster... Continually making us tell you we don't fucking want #trumpcare
Shame on you Lindsey Graham. You know this bill will leave millions without healthcare and essentially kill
Bye,Bye Lindsey, no re elect for you!!!
Many people want a bi-partisan fix. Why are you making it worse with each introduction of new legislation? What is the matter with you?
Hush.
How about we cancel your healthcare first?  Then cancel Cassidy.   You irresponsible fool.  Be a part of the solution and fix the ACA!
those are some ugly numbers @LindseyGrahamSC
This is no health care package, this is the destroying of the American Healthcare System. ACA stays, fix it, work on it
Causing people's deaths is not something to support. Why can't your party ever come up with something that actually helps average people?
What is the matter with you?! You are a disgusting human!!! How could you be so cruel? I will never support you ever again!!
Would you and your family be happy with this proposal for their healthcare? Would they survive?
No. They will not be happy, and will not cover themselves with fake insurance. #savetheACA my son beat brain cancer because of #ACA
And my grandson beat leukemia with it too. However at age 8, he now has a pre-existing condition through no fault of his own.
I have an 8 yr old granddaughter bc of ACA. Cancerous brain tumor at 19 months. #Save ACA 
Only reason Lindsey would be supporting this unpopular of a deal is money. Follow the money!
Was a fan, no longer. You either don't care or have no clue.
NO
@GOP ARE LYING IN ORDER TO PASS THEIR DRACONIAN, GENOCIDAL AGENDA. DON'T ALLOW THIS. FORCE THESE NAZIS TO DO RIGHT THING. WE PAY TAXES TOO.
Replace with Medicare for ALL.
Ok , who's paying?
Single payer please.
Why do you want to hurt Americans while agreeing to tax cuts for the rich? Is someone greasing your palm?
I love how you keep calling it Obamacare... Maybe we should use #ACA and see who wants a repeal then.
You are willing to cause harm to millions of Americans to appease your corporate masters and rabid base #SaveACA #ProtectOurCare

#NoRepealandReplace #FixACA
Don't expect support for anything while Deplorable Donnie is playing Nazi apologist
With your healthcare plan I will still not have coverage! Why, why, why can there not be a bipartisan solution that would actually help!?
You're right, Lindsey, you and the GOP are definitely running out of time...2018 is coming and it doesn't look good for the GOP
The issue is not legislation, but regulation of the healthcare industry. You and colleagues have no problem with their rape of sick & needy
No one sane can believe you are actually going to waste our time and money putting us through this again. #noGrahamCassidy
The largest pool creates the least cost. For all of us. Keep ACA and expand. #MedicareForAll
You have run out of time to deprive millions of Americans of their human right to health care. GIVE UP ON THIS ZOMBIE BILL
Your plan is disgusting, you should resign & turn yourself into authorities for Treason. Your plan murders American Citizens! Resign now!
Why won't you all agree to verify payment to the insurance companies or give us the insurance plan given to you for free?
This plan is as bad as any repeal bill yet. CBO says 32M will lose coverage and pre-existing conditions will cost much much more.
Horrible plan! Stop trying so hard to hurt Americans. You can do better by not doing evil. #RepublicanAdministration #Republicanshame
Never, ever will I support this, or anyone who does. I will join to support the end your political career however, your legacy.
Shame on you for suggesting such a "MEAN" Bill!  30 million people will suffer/die/go bankrupt!
People with Pre-Existing conditions will suffer!  You are so MEAN!  If you think this BILL is so great, YOU have this Health Care!
If a women gives birth to a baby with a birth defect, that's not enough sadness, you are allowing the Ins. Co. to charge more. WTF!
Ask yourself this question..would I like this Health Care for my family?  If the answer is NO, it's bad.
No. We The People don't want your awful bill. I knew Cassidy was an awful person but expected better than you.
The hostility that some Republicans hold against Trump and his agenda but cajoled Obama isnt going unnoticed
Stop playing politics with people's lives
No. This is horrible legislation only designed to strip the Obama legacy and give Trump a win.The majority want a bipartisan fix of the ACA.
We Have Not Given Up*

*On killing so very many of you for corporate greed

Have you even considered making healthcare affordable for all?
Do YOUR job. The "leader" of the free world retweeted-of him hitting Hillary in back of head w/a golf ball.
You'llkill people. This bill & those who back it are disgraceful. You want votes? Start impeachment proceedings. THAT would be popular!
How about a legislation where whatever healthcare law you impose on us won't make you exempt from it?
Time to tax the churches! They're using their pulpits for political views! Medicare for ALL!
You mean the one where children with birth defects won't be covered?
Here's the repeal & replace we need!
I'm pretty sure that the AARP opposes your ridiculous legislation.
Try working on a bipartisan solution that will not uninsure millions, remove pre-existing condition protections, or cut/cap Medicaid.
No.
Never! You are supposed to represent all the people of your state, yet you ignore half of your state. You know better. Voting you out.
I'm smelling bacon and hearing banjos dueling in the distance. #MakeTruckstopsGreatAgain
An Independent who respects you, and NO this legislation is wrong, think of all the people's lives you will destroy with this 24+ million.
I tried lindy, i TRIED,so hard 2 like U,  give U a chance 2 BE/ACT human-then YOU go & try to kill us.  How shall we take that? FU is,answr.
Cruel and heartless legislation. Surely you are a better man than this? You should be ashamed to have your new associated with this Bill.
#HowTheACASavedMyLife

I am one of the #FacesOfACA

NO to #GrahamCassidy 

#AmericaSpeaksOut
 
.@upnorthrobyn was born w/craniofacial defect.
Had 40 surgeries. Suffers #PTSD & #agoraphobia.
Needs #ACA to live.
#FacesOfACA #TheLoyalO 
Enough, already. Just improve ACA and move on. This is getting ridiculous and petty.
burn in hell mr. graham, what you are doing is evil





Sen Graham is OK with screwing millions of Americans as long as he gets the media coverage. Disgusting waste of a senate seat. @SenateDems
You must stop this; it is going to destroy millions of peoples lives. Stop this and support changes to the ACA that will help.
It will be a COLD DAY IN HELL when I and many, many others support this DEATH BILL. Thanks for NOTHING. Nice try, sh*tstain.

Do this kiss your career good -bye both of you. Repeal and leave those with coverage with no coverage..brilliant. DT destroying you!
Majority of Americans don't want #ACA repealed, you were elected to represent your constituents, do right for your country not the lobbyists
"We have not given up trying to take away your healthcare & leave you with crap #Trumpcare" #SaveACA
I actually thought you cared for sick people. This is a cruel, disgusting bill.
Sorry old white men who are only interested in filling their pockets, not protecting their constituents! P. O. !
Senator Graham is a traitor.
Senator please stop this charade
oh hell no.
All you've offered up is a turd. It stinks. Start over.


If you don't support #MedicareForAll you don't represent me
How would someone with the condition but not the means of @SenJohnMcCain fare trying to buy insurance under your plan? No repeal #Obamacare
If you Rs would get off the "gotta repeal ACA because Obama implemented it" crap..y'all might be able to work together and actually HELP!
I'm a constituent from Latta, SC. I oppose this. If anyone else does here's a link to tweet senators  http://www.factpower.org/healthcare-tweetstorm.html â€¦
Give it up. Your bill is just another hateful attempt to subvert the already established will of the people. Time's running out on flim flam
Yes, make sure the GOP destroys your healthcare...
GIVE UP.  Stop trying to murder millions of innocent Americans so a few 1% can profit.  GET THE PROFIT out of healthcare. #SaveACA
No - you're a liar. This legislation is brutal. Marginally better than trumpcare. We will resist.
Fixed your graphic for you:
#lawfulevil legislation
Shame on you. Shame on @GOP

#SaveACA #ProtectOurCare
The country has spoken. Drop it.
Simple:  put everyone in Washington on Obamacare and it will be repealed and replaced in a week!
#Repeal Replace Republicans

JUST OUT: Here's a summary of the Graham-Cassidy repeal. Yes, it's that bad.

Spread far and wide if useful. 
All talk, no action. Get it done and stop posturing.
Nope, just nope.
Dear Mr. Senator:  pass this despicable piece of legislation  and you will be on par with the grim reaper.
Your constituents will vote you out of office for your pushing for this awful healthcare plan!
Are you crazy too?
Gonna have to pass.
Git 'ER done!!
L. Graham (rino, SC) has no intention of making the U.S. better.
Please stop using your elected Senate seat to act in the worst interests of South Carolinians and all Americans.
Read these tweets- is it sinking in yet??????? Just NOOOOOOOOO!
Hell no- this sucks big time. You people are just evil.
#MedicareForAll
THE ASSES, CAN'T STAND LIFE, ONLY THEIRS..THEY GET IT PAID FOR LIFE. ID BET THEY USE OBAMACARE.THEY FLIP FLOP AND CANT COME UP WITH ANYTHING

No damn way.......shame on you!
You have all the support of all people that voted for our beloved president Trump!
Exactly. Out of time and out of office
I had some respect for you @LindseyGrahamSC  no more after this new healthcare bill you are bringing to the Fl
You are out of time
Health Care is a human right. Anything less than universal health care is inhumane. Stop wasting our money on war. #cravenpilitician,
This legislation is heartless and cruel. How many people in SC are going to lose coverage? In America?
As long as you replace it with Medicare for All...
You are tone deaf.
Thank God for NY @NYGovCuomo at least we have decent insurance for ppl who need it ! @LindseyGrahamSC needs to hear from you how to do it
Maybe you should fix it and not end it ! My dgt who has a masters degree and works two jobs would not have decent insurance except for this
How come you never stand up to Trump? You're useless.
Heard it is nothing more than Obama Lite!
Oh Lindsey. SMH
no.  The people of this country do not agree with you.
Just fix it!!  I'm loosing faith in you now
WE DO NOT SUPPORT REPEAL!!!! #universalhealthcare Fix the ACA and stop trying to take away care from 32 million Americans

Single payer would have cured a great many of the #ACA's flaws

But you guys demonized it as "big government"

Healthcare is a *human* right
What are we at now, @LindseyGrahamSC? 60 failed votes?

That sounds suspiciously like "Democracy has spoken".

And it disagrees with you.
We don't need to repeal. Just fix the damn thing already and stop being obstinate
If you want repeal, come up with something that protects the vulnerable, oh that's right, you don't care! 
What the hell you been done by for the last eight years slacker. Must be nice to have a paycheck not tied to performance. Political hack
Give up, it's a bad bill!
Nope.
Your legacy bill will mean death for millions Senator. Is that what you want?
I support Sens Murray and Alexander's efforts to fix the ACA. Your attempt to repeal the ACA is NOT supported by the American people.
Give it up! It only highlights how dysfunctional and divided the Republican Party is. And now even your own leader has defected to the Dems.
Why not just fix Obamacare? Why? I don't understand why congress can't work with a system that has flaws but is also saving lives.
Senator, I respect you. This bill would KILL people - would kill CHILDREN by bringing back the preexisting condition clause. No, just no.
Ummm...nobody likes it.
How about #FixAndImprove Obamacare? 

If it's so terrible, why not make it better rather than trying to sabotage it?
@GOP you better get it done or you can say goodbye to Washington!!!!
Count me out. Majority of Americans support fix the ACA
Why are you picking this hill to die on?  This legislation sucks and u know it.
I'd prefer a "Make it Better" campaign but I get it...you're running for office & have a reputation to maintain.
Why do you want more people to die or go bankrupt from lack of insurance?
Why are you so hellbent to hurt your constituents and deny affordable healthcare? Who bullied you as a child to fill you with such malice?
Stop it Lindsey, stop it. You lost the battle. Time to reach across the aisle, make that work instead.
We support Medicare For All!
Give up!
You talk a good game Senator! Less talk and more action for a change!
Translation:  We are running out of time to cull the herd.
No.
Medicare for all.
How many times have you failed? There's a reason for that. Listen to your constituents. We do not want a repeal.
@realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan At least one congressman is still trying to get rid of that time bomb @BarackObama put around us
Huh, you should probably give up.  Unless you really want to continue to show just how little concern you have for middle America.
Just get them to start working for the country!
No.
You need to check the #'s 
The American People want you to keep & fix the ACA with the help of Democrats.
YOU represent Us.
Do your job!!  You get paid way more for the time you out in for little result
