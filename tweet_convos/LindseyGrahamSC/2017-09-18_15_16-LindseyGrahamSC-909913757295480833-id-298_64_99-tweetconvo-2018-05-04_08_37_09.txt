Lindsey sho been eatin good.
Pie charts for Pie faces!
Hope it dies a painful death!!
Wrong. This is not a choice at all. It allows for opt-outs that will drive up pricing and reduce coverage. This is not a bill Americans want
#FIRSTDONOHARM
Hope it dies a painful death
Hopefully it will be the last chance for any Republican bill that guts Medicaid and will cause people to die. Not to mention tank stocks!
@BillCassidy Ur bill is so bad GOP governors hate it, bc they know it will kill their voters. Not #MAGA
Pass.
Bad luck to the sell outs in the GOP. Drain the swamp of the @GOP including Trump and Pence.
So they should ignore the work of the senate health committee who's working w/ EXPERTS to have a better bill? & No CBO score on impact
Thank you @LindseyGrahamSC !!! Let's get this done!!! @NRSC @SenateGOP @mitchellvii  Love that #chuckieIsMad #smallOpportunity to do this!
well, at least your healthcare will go to shit too. And at least this speeds up the reality of passing a single-payer.
Even majority of dems are running from that….can’t pay for it.
yeah that's b/c majority still want to keep ACA, once the GOP does this, that ends.
Because making healthcare free to competition & focus on why costs are rising..not just a bandaid…we all win. ACA doesn’t do that. GOP does
Government care never reduces costs…it just strangles care and quality. Hasn’t worked for innovation and expanding quality. Medicaid for all
Government care isn't as profit focused Here's a real life ex.
every hospital has a Chargemaster that determines their prices...
So a CT scan is $8000,good insurance works off the chargemaster & generally covers 30-50%.Medicare on the other hand has a diff price, $650
How come it has to be something with Lindsay Graham' s name on it?  Just don't trust the man.  He's a RINO through and through.
Look at @BillCassidy 's stupid chart. If those red states would have expanded Medicaid, then they would have gotten more funds. Idiot.
@BillCassidy Republicans for sale!!! Make it rain Koch Bros! You are KILLING for $$ #DrainTheSwamp

real death panel at work - no debate, no stakeholders allowed Democracy DEAD
too

#ACA repealer @BillCassidy announced in 2014 his teen daughter, Meg, was pregnant & "faces a more challenging future than her peers."
what about the american people? Is it best for the citizens? You are letting us know that is pure politics, not about what is best
It doesn't do any of the things people need. Boo hiss

Kimmel, not Cassidy, is right on health care, analysts say - POLITICO Pro https://www.politicopro.com/health-care/story/2017/09/kimmel-not-cassidy-is-right-on-health-care-analysts-say-162156 …
Why are we trying to replace Obamacare with another law that will cost US tax payers more and insure fewer people? Math, not politics, now.
Certainly not the best. I hope it's the last.

No conserv who cheers ripping away the insurance for babies born with critical diseases (for tax cuts) can EVER claim to be pro-life again.
How about health care  like senators have!!!
"Replace" means "Last chance to take coverage away from tens of millions who got it through Obamacare". C'mon, guys, let's #CullTheHerd!
Why is Graham smiling? since he is the Grim Reaper.  Lot of his constituents will not be smiling but HE will Cadillac health care.


Wow. Four old white men from the South. What a surprise. #Republicans #2017 #SCUM
Not an overhaul/ It's a rip off from 32 million Americans given to a bunch of 1% rich fucks like you/ US will rip you to shreds for this!
It is not about replacing Obamacare MoFos, it is about making sure we get better healthcare.  This is not it!

What Graham-Cassidy will do to people with pre-existing conditions, an issue long thought untouchable, is simply reprehensible.
Last best chance for you to get KOCH $$$$$$.....KOCH CARE not health care !!!
Look at these men who care NOTHING about the MILLIONS of FAMILIES they will deprive of INSURANCE they only see KOCH BROS $$$
Propaganda and Lies!  Worst bill by far!

Look at how many rich white men smile when they are fucking the people below them on economic ladder .
You just lost another vote
Glad to see such "glee" in condemning citizens to death by passing this horror of "health care"
cruel
Which is EXACTLY why it must be defeated. We deserve and must demand better. You WILL be held accountable, hopefully not over my dead body.
since Lindsey is a rich white gay man (in denial) he doesn't need ACA subsidies #saveACA #yousucklindseygraham
@LindseyGrahamSC As a citizen I am so sad that Sen. Graham is still trying to repeal O'Care without hearings, CBO.  Shame!
Your bill is disgraceful and hurts most Americans. Stop helping the rich! Hopefully, it will be the death of the #GOP. #UniversalHealthCare
Replace for how long? This plan ends all block grants to states for healthcare in 2025. This is no replacement.
Last desperate scramble to sucker-punch the American people.
It's the "worst" chance, you fake news propaganda site. "Washington Examiner", what a joke.
It's a horrible bill that will kill people
That @LindseyGrahamSC looks so happy! Working hard to screw the 220K people in SC as well as the rest of the country!
You spelled "last chance" wrong.
Does it pass the @jimmykimmel test? Or did you lie to America?
Pathetic. You're more concerned with helping Trump dismantle Obama's legacy than the health/well being of  Americans. Party over country.
@BillCassidy The hell it is!
Cassidy is a lying piece of shit.
Take a good look around. If you really believed in God you would see he's not happy
Seriously?

The last best chance is not good enough
Really? You’re a sell out too? Is there any Republican that cares about the people. Watch this video: https://www.facebook.com/jimmykimmel/videos/1977414852535607/ …
Bullshit! #GrahamCassidyBillKills #GOPRussiaComplicit #CassidyIsALiar #CassidyGrahamBillKills
Lindsey, what happened to you.... is John speaking to you?
The  @jimmykimmel test for Bill Cassidy is a lie detector. Sen @BillCassidy LIED. He lied!!! save the ACA
Socialism? Seriously? Spreading a false narrative to scare ppl so you can get a cruel spending cut bill passed? (Healthcare bill no way).
and you smile while you present your death plan
Liar liar liar @BillCassidy

People with pre-existing conditions, pregnant women among those who lose out in GOP's latest health care bill. http://apne.ws/iP7et7Z 
I hope so.  Only 18% of nation wants this.  Most of them are you SHAMEFUL DISGUSTING RICH WHITE MEN.  SHAME!
Your plan will KILL MY SON.
I'm ashamed of you Bill; you bring shame upon our country
Shame on you Bill Cassidy! 400,000 of your constituents will lose coverage. No protection for pre-existing conditions. Less money to LA.
No, it's @SenateGOP's last best chance to make keep the Koch bros & other wealthy donors keep lining @GOP pockets:
Mueller have you investigated the Koch bros?
Over 8 years of GOP lies about ACA & they have nothing better.  GOP is dying w/o any policies that help families. #Obstructionism
SAD that the average person has no idea how bad it will hurt them.
Why?  Just so you can say you did it?  PLEASE do the right thing for sick people who benefit - improve the ACA!!  Jennifer Hosterman

You're taking away my health care.  You Trump lover. Hell has a special place for you
Reward your donors at the expense of your constituency.  Well played.
They're all monsters.
HAHAHA! We're white and rich and have health insurance!
HAHAHA! If you're not like us...
No health insurance for you! HAHAHAHA!
Maybe we should learn from countries that cover all of its citizens.
It may be your last and best chance, but that's not good enough.
will these asshats be taking this "insurance"? if it's good enough for us, then they should be made to also.
But Bill Cassidy's own state Secretary of the Dept of Health STRONGLY DISAGREES:
My letter to @BillCassidy explaining how his bill uniquely and disproportionally hurts his home state of Louisiana. 

Watch the VIDEO. Find out what is really in the bill. On @MSNBC with @JRubinBlogger
I'd rather live & not have to consider suicide an option in order to save my family from crushing debt, thanks! #GrahamCassidy is murder!
Cassidy needs to be replaced.  Lied to Jimmy Kimmel and the country.
THESE MEN ARE LIARS @BillCassidy  @LindseyGrahamSC
JUST IN: American Medical Association comes out against new ObamaCare repeal bill http://hill.cm/UrYXlMA  

#GreatReads: The staggering hypocrisy of Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham: http://bit.ly/2xkjGXg  @mattyglesias 
Best chance for what??? Penalizes pre-existing conditions. Guts Medicaid. Sounds like a death sentence to me pitiful. 
Sen. Bill Cassidy said he'd apply a 'Jimmy Kimmel test' to health care. His own bill fails that test

Old enough to remember when @SenateGOP promised they wouldn't take health care away from a sick child. #GrahamCassidy https://twitter.com/jimmykimmel/status/909872706828386305 …
@BillCassidy Wow....how many of the #MAGA base will this financially ruin & make homeless Bill? #GrahamCassidy #KillerBill
Nothing best about it. Sucks!!.
The world doesnt revolve around Graham. It not this..their will be other attempts to repeal. This is not the "last" if if fails.
Look how happy @BillCassidy is to take away healthcare funding for his state.  Congrats Louisiana!!
9/19  #CallToAction: #GrahamCassidy is the #1 threat to  now. We need bipartisan fixes, not Deathcare. CALL Congress! #LoyalO…

What are you replacing it with?  premiums that will destroy the middle class!So unaffordable that millions will die #GOP driven #genocide
Cassidy gets $1.6 million from the insurance industry. We know whose side he is on
@BillCassidy #GrahamCassidyBill is a death sentence for Americans & will hit  Trump's base BIGLY! For top 1% tax cuts.Not #MAGA
Shame on you. Truly, shame. Millions will suffer due to your actions and your bill. I'm disgusted by all of you.
Horrible bill
You will cause the death of many Americans and suffering of many more , all for greed. #trumprussia #treason was for greed + #climatechange

My letter to @BillCassidy explaining how his bill uniquely and disproportionally hurts his home state of Louisiana. 
What year is this?
What is wrong with you? Why are you set on killing us? No pre exist cond & I'm dead. I have ins through my company but w/o this I will die
No it's not!
What is the rush to pass a healthcare bill w/out hearings? How do you defend the disparate impact this plan has on the poor and minorities?

NEW: Graham-Cassidy ACA Repeal Bill Would Cause Huge Premium Increases for People with Pre-Existing Conditions https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/news/2017/09/18/439091/graham-cassidy-aca-repeal-bill-cause-huge-premium-increases-people-pre-existing-conditions/ …
Replacing Obamacare should not be the push now, it should be to repeal it and then once it is gone let free market work!
& to think I was actually beginning to respect you just a tad with your outspoken opposition on Trump's rhetoric...& now coauthor of this
Last best chance to harm Americans in the interest of corporations and lobbyists. Graham is a hypocrite and a liar. Sad.
What's the rush?  Why not do a decent job and devote some time to it.  Will YOU use this plan?  Of course not.  Yours is fabulous.
The last best choice before they die?  The fuck @GOP?  Stop trying to kill people. It's getting old.

@LindseyGrahamSC :
What to see the CBO report...come clean and let us know what's in your Bill...
They are likely going to vote on it before the CBO score comes out. They are saying it takes too long
@BillCassidy @LindseyGrahamSC @seanhannity DO NOT TAKE AWAY FROM MEDICAID!!! Wtf are you thinking?! LEAVE MEDICAID ALONE!! Jeez!
Murderers.  #deathtograham
@RandPaul @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @SenJohnMcCain
SHAME ON YOU! #SaveACA
Look @ all of you laughing! Guess who isn't laughing? The Majority of Americans! U keep effin w/this so you can bow to Big Insurance. Stop!!
Why? Why replace? We r fighting for people's insurance. WHO ARE U FIGHTING 4? Now ins not pay 4 opioid rehab? But u want no opioids? What??
Graham et al. are ignoring the Universal Natural Law - LIFE..."My life and the lives of my loved ones mean as much to me as yours to you."
@BillCassidy @dougducey This is a #KillerBill. It will kill thousands in #Trump's base ea year. #MAGA? #DrainTheSwamp
Last best chance to force tens of millions off coverage? It would have tragic consequences for millions of citizens. #MedicareForAll
@BillCassidy Good Lord, even your home state Sec of Health hates your bill. Crush Americans to help the rich? #DrainTheSwamp
It's not an overhaul, it's a redux  in worse of what we had before, which was shameless exploitation of the less fortunate.
I vote No from South Carolina!
WRONG. WE DO NOT want or need #ACA replaced. We want it reviewed, FIXED & supported to ensure affordable & sustainable long term future.
You're killing us and those who can't help themselves. Where's your moral standards!? Idk what crack you smoking but repeal makes no sense!!

Top Louisiana health official rips Louisiana Republican: Your ObamaCare repeal bill hurts our state http://hill.cm/F2PMOFt  
@GOP broke all their promises with this. as usual. 2018's gonna hurt the RINOs
You're going to squander the GOP majority and hurt millions of people. I've lost all respect for you, sir. 2018 can't get here soon enough.
That not what we want! We don't give a sh#@ about names. We need responsible, humane healthcare. #wtf #KillTheBill
Congrats Senator!  You are the face of this cruel bill.  It will be your legacy.
Patient groups come out in force to condemn new GOP bill to repeal ObamaCare http://hill.cm/5xruJ1b  
Its a desperate attempt to say you did something.  Pathetic.
It's a death sentence for the most vulnerable.  If the Senate believes differently then they must convince us.  Show us the bill!
This is not an overhaul - it's a death panel. Shame on this evil plan hatched by the GOP. #GrahamCassidyKills
I don't understand why the GOP enjoys Removing older people from Medicare and taking healthcare from children. It is disgusting!Disappointed
