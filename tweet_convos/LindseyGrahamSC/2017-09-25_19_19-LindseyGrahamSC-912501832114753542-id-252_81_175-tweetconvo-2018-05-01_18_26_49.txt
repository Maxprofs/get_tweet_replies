#HealthCareDebate Repeal and Replace Obamacare with a  OVER STATE LINE COMPETITIVE HEALTH INSURANCE.
Credit Card industry was allowed to do that, everyone of them moved to the state with highest interest rates and worst consumer protection.
IF THE GOVERNMENT STAYED OUT OF IT AND IT’S ACROSS STATE LINES OTHER SMALLER COMPANIES AND MORE COMPETITION. ECONOMICS 101
Really cuz it worked so well with credit card companies right? Also caps doesn't make your argument any more convincing.
???I’m talking Real Americans.
 GOD BLESS AMERICA 
Wow straight from failed economics to racist rant. How completely predictable.
And that’s straight from COMMUNIST NEWS NETWORK
"I don't think that it's ever smart to change 1/5th of the economy on Party Line Vote", said Lindsey Graham (2010). Do leopard-spots change?

Someone next time turn on Grindr to see if Lindsey is near
Press your way out of the Senate #selfish
Party SYMBOLS r mixed up! Elephant should b DEMS., smart good memory & hardworkers! REP., DONKEY, STUBBORN AS MULES!!
Meanwhile we are Sabre rattling with NK and Congress does not appear to care @RepAdamSchiff @SenKamalaHarris @SenJohnMcCain @SpeakerRyan
It's More like "Hoppalong-Cassidy, meets the Great Train Robbery.


No respect for the American people. .that is when they need to get voted out.
Give  it  up

I am galled by your mendacity, Sir lies a lot.
ObamaCare current Cbo score is better than this Graham-Cassidy score. Even with intentional defundment of Medicare, McConnell never matched.
Senator Graham, no repeal! Fix Aca work together to make it the Best! Tell Price & Trump to stop the sabatoge! We the People are watching 
D's are fortunate Trump turned out to be super-clown. Medical profession about to end thanks to him. D's should be sending roses to WH.
Oh hush up Lindsey. Get a life and try to understand the millions of people you are trying to hurt with your ACA bill as well as your party!
You're a CRIMINAL

figures they would not post what @LindseyGrahamSC actually said but think that the @BernieSanders mouth vomit need exact reiteration
With what, your tax cut for the rich disguised as a health-care bill that will throw millions off their insurance?
AFTER GRP INSURANCE I paid >$10,000 for ONE ERvisit.ONLY vital signs & AB-SO-LUTE-LY NOTHING ELSE-no labs,tests,consult. FIX AFFORDABILITY.
Many of us who suffer from similar medical conditions akin to your friend @SenJohnMcCain, but have no voice to achieve similar care #SAD
Go in a corner and lick ur political wounds. A house divided against itself cannot stand.
@BillCassidy @SenSanders Just remember every single Senator "voting to save you" from Government healthcare HAS GOVERNMENT HEALTHCARE!
So we're to believe states passing laws to suppress minority voters are somehow going to do the right thing w/block grants for healthcare!?
Sad that a couple of RINOs and Democrats are nothing more than obstructionist!  You Republicans are Discraceful, all TALK!
This is a terrible, rambling, meaningless response.
Sad story, random numbers, and babbling about doing better.
Meaningless.
@LindseyGrahamSC Lindsey, now you're really making laughing stock of yourself! You don't have votes to pass your bill. Give it up already!

If the ACA is the catastrophic failure you profess it to be then why do so few Americans support your bill? Where is your silent majority?
You do that.
You're trying to screw us with the medical plan then you'll screw us on tax reform. SENATORS vote NO, Follow John McCain's lead.
Yeah, and screw the American public..... GOP thieves.

BINGO PUT PEOPLE FIRST AND PARTY POLITICS AWAY WE R 1 NATION INDIVISIBLE HENCE WHATEVER OUR POLITICS CARE  LISTEN & BE CIVIL WITH EACH OTHER
Remember there are over 5 millions US Citizens voters from PR  here, PR needs help of the US Congress Now, press on
I'm from SC and that's just a damn lie!
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenSanders how can you say insurance is not about "Caring" its about cutting budgeta, then you add SOCIAL SECURITY to it
Who is going to pay for everyone's HC? Ours got hammered by Obamacare and so did our budget! Pls address those families like ours that lost.
Graham, Cassidy admit the federal gov cannot deliver healthcare coverage but states can. They are the face of federal gov.  IMPOTENT
Instead of saying what CG WILL do, all he can say is "Obamacare is failing." 
Your good fiend has brain cancer and you want to take health care away from millions. Shame!
FYI: Some states did not even except the Medicaid expansion to help it's citizens. What makes you think they will utilize options.
Why bother with healthcare bills when you could save tons of money just by rounding up all the poor people and exterminating them?
.@LindseyGrahamSC why are you grimacing?
I don’t always agree with you on some topics, but I appreciate your honesty & respect & that you continue to support your friend Sen. McCain
Honesty:Graham are mutually exclusive
You're wrong on this Senator. You can fix the ACA if you wanted to instead of allowing it to fail. Stop calling it Obamacare for starters.
To quote You, this is "SLEAZY"
Cut the military budget
"We need to create a future our children can afford." Well said, great job tonight.
A good example of Party over America
@POTUS @LindseyGrahamSC  said "THIS IS NOT ABOUT CARING" and they had to do something about 3 leading debt causes including SOCIAL SECURITY
hey Bernie he wants a fight!!!!! lol...
What about 600 billion or 54% of us budget on military use that for education and health ins. After 600 billion we still cant stop nk
Wish Graham worried about Health Care as he does the Defense Budget. Your bill is NOT the answer for America! Work Bipartisan @amyklobuchar
Because there is nothing else you could be doing.
What else can he say?
garbage that will subdue their lobbyists and get them a nice little payday. Your constituents are DONE with the corrupt bullshit!
Health insurance for all American citizens.

Senator Graham,
I used to believe your a man of principle
Like your Friend Senetor McCain pleasr work  together  to fix Obama  care.
Great job Lindsey and Cassidy and I am surprised that it was moderated well by CNN
Cassidy solution = send ACA money to all 50 states - Cassidy's own governor doesn't want Cassidy's bill or his money - neither does AMA, AHA

Is it just me, or does he resemble Nurse Ratched?
GOP no care bill is "abortion" of the elderly and ill
"Until we pass a relief bill for #PuertoRico?" No?  Oh, right, I'm not in my fantasy world.  Sigh.
Maybe SC should have accepted expanded Medicaid instead listening to the old oppose oppose Obamacare McConnell
You say you are not going to throw more money at insurance companies,  but aren't they going to be providing the plans for the states????
Graham-Cassidy will be flushed down the toilet like the huge pile of shit that it is. These do nothing's waste time and money trying to pass
You done lost your mind. Who will pay?
That's a lie
High quality health to some at extremely high quality prices that most can’t afford. Sounds perfect. 
The ACA is working very well for me and my vet husband. Changed our lives! Thanks Obama. Go Bernie and Senator Klobachar!
Because you value a Party victory over human lives
Good luck senator... No One Believes In a piece of s*** bill coming from Rs. Especially the same one that you rinse and repeat 3 times now
Do something for your constituents and fix the ACA!
Federal run programs are failures, State run programs are worst. People will abandon poor states(VA, TN, KY) migrate to affordable states.
YES,PLEASE!Put BACK the trillion dollars of Medicaid.Attack legislation regarding suppliers. I paid $450 for ONE urinalysis.$950 for ONE LAB
so the woman from Maryland dies if the state decides not to cover her under your bill. She lives under Obamacare!
Nope 
Universal single payer take it out of the hand of the insurance companies and pay for it by cutting the 700 billion you appropriated for war
Epic fail.  If you keep pushing your seat will be lost.  Count on it.
And we will be sure to press the right lever in 2018!!!!!!
Time to give up
Beating a dead horse now... on with the regular order!
Do you realize you would not be eligable for a subsidy Give me a break  That Cassidy is ruining what little credibility u have left
Bullshit. The ACA is not failing. You need more money from big pharma

... Great debate, almost makes up for having to suffer through #FakeTapper and #DanaBrash... 
#CNNSucks
What is the real truth behind pressing on? Trying to erase Pres. Obama from history, not decreasing uninsured.
What a liar. It’s the I Hate Obama Bill. Has nothing to do with health care and everything to do with denying an achievement to a black man.
Great story but how will you control states and insurance companies from denying care?  Specifics please.....
Translation: we're going to try and bribe, pressure and force this through even though we know it will harm millions of Americans. Shameful.
you're an ugly bastard
AGAIN POLITICS &STUBBORNESS IN KNOWING WHATS RIGHT FOR US POOR FOLKS THATS PARAMOUNT & OBSTINATE VIEW FOR SAKEOF PARTY POLITICS WHY NOT WORK
TOGETHER FOR A BETTER SOLUTION &FOR GOD'S SAKE GIVE US FAITH AGAIN IN OUR REPRESENTATIVES DOING GOOD FOR D COUNTRY AS A WHOLE LESS SELFISH
Press on and lose. These idiots never learn. YOUR BILL IS TRASH
Perhaps next time it should be less horrible.
But senator it is working, you and your party's antics are causing those problems.
Republicans should just let Obamcare collapse all insurance companies pulling out by 2018 will die a death on its own the Demm own it
SenGraham has good ideas how 2 cut costs 4 Medicaid& prolong Medicare. But can b done n context better than GrahamCassidy #HealthCareDebate
Of course you are for your billionaires sake. You don't give a damn about the plight of every day Americans from atop your glass castles.
With a bipartisan plan?! Great! Here is one. Please send to your senator and congressman https://m.forbes.com/sites/carolynmcclanahan/2017/03/27/rising-from-the-ashes-a-novel-bipartisan-approach-to-health-care-reform/?s=trending#370582e31362 … @CarolynMcC
yes....  a "damn good idea" ---   that's about ALL it is though.  Not sure patients can pay premiums with  "ideas."
I hope Graham Cassidy Heller & Republicans who vote for this bill die painful deaths & that hospitals are deregulated & can deny them care!
Anybody else have the urge to reach out and smack Lindsey's smug, lying little  face?
Stop lying. Less than 3% of Americans are on the exchanges, and of that small number, 80% have subsidies to offset premium increases.
The 2 Republican Eunuchs are getting schooled at this debate..#BadMoveSon
Definition of insanity ...
...so much on travel and secret service! The #GOP priorities need to get more in line with the majority of Americans!! #GrahamCassidyNO
They need this Dad @ the Discussion
Watch this Dad say what every other American is feeling. Stop trying to take our healthcare away & start helping us! 

Once your defeated leave ACA alone and improve it.
They are cruel and heartless. They don't care how this will affect people's lives.
Graham you just told her a block grant didn't save her 
Thw freaking program was paid for by the block grant 
How dare you dismiss her
*the*
@BillCassidy says he's a Doctor & he plays one on TV.
Cassidy likes to remind us he's a doctor- it hardly shows!
Could somebody ask why we can't go to chips for kids Medicaid for those who needs it Medicare for all and Tricare for vets? What is issue?
Delusional. I live in IN where VP Pence when governor REFUSED to expand Medicaid. The current Republicans who control our state will do same
7 years 7 months 7 days total GOP ruse fraud failure in attempt to repeal ACA.  Total disgrace.
Graham keeps telling us Congress doesn't care about or answer to their constituents but that their Governors do. They only answer to donors.
Shows how mch u knw abt medcd! It prvnts the need 2goto E.R.!  You get a personal physn on medicaid! YOU JUST PROVED U KNOW NOTHING ABT IT!
CNN sucks
#DoNoHarm
We all want to fix it. Come on @LindseyGraham you're playing politics. Bipartisan fix. We all know that's going on! Let it work!!!
Tired of hearing that States can/will do better job managing HealthCare than Federal Govt. Neither official listens to constituents..
I dont trust my state to manage anything - WI
GOP:  what is it about Healthcare that you don’t understand?  The majority of Americans want it!
You keep trying to reduce coverage and scope.  That’s not what people want.
How about not, because not pressing on works for most of us. But since you never listen to any of us I guess you wouldn't really know that.
These republicans are such liars.
Nothing more than HATE Reporting @CNN 
Will find only @DNC agreeables!

A SHAM!
Completely INCOMPETENT BIASED 
#FakeNews
STOP acting like Healthcare is the only way the federal government can save money!!! Tell your moronic #dotard to stop spending...
@SenJohnMcCain and @LindseyGrahamSC are the exact swamp monsters we want out. #DrainTheSwamp #MAGA
Missed last chance to stop single payer thanks to @SenJohnMcCain @RandPaul @tedcruz @SenatorCollins! Sad! @realDonaldTrump @VP @NRSC
https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/policy-and-politics/2017/9/22/16349470/polling-graham-cassidy-not-good … experts agree with Americans #GrahamCassidyNO
You can't make things better if you don't approve of spending the money to do it.
Please don't.  You're an embarrassment.
Good luck with that @LindseyGrahamSC . After Friday you feckers will need 60% to pass #45care
IS THERE A REASON ONLY GOP VIDS being tweeted out? WANT TO TRY FACTS AND SUBSTANCE OVER show boating????
Graham bill hurts 2 many people Is the best he can come up with kick it back to the states
Try listening to the majority of the American people sir!
You are a great man- but your bill is terrible. Agree with you that repeal isn't enough- but how about fix?
@LindseyGrahamSC half debt is the money borrowed from SS to fight wars for oil! Tough that has to be paid back - guess there's no tax cut!
For an important public policy debate like this, put it in a format most people can access and not CNNGo's garbage pail of a service.
