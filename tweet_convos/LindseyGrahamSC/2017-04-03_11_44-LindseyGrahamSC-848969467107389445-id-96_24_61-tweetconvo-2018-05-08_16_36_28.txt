#TrumpRussia + Gorsuch too extreme+Garland?+ change rules b/c can't follow the rules?+ will bite you on the ass in the future. @GOP Bad idea
A few years ago, majority of Dems UNANIMOUSLY approved Gorusch, now he's too extreme? Yeah ok. Pfft!
Different job and scope of powers. Higher bar for the Supreme Court, as it should be.
Gorusch is a CONSTITUTIONAL Judge! He's a BRILLIANT pick!
Anyway, no one should be nominated until all investigations have been concluded to see if the nominator is even qualified to nominate anyone
He's the President. Period. He already nominated him.NOTHING can nullify that. Gorusch is a great pick for both sides. It's pure politics.
And he is "currently" president.We will see how long that lasts. I would seriously be surprised if he isn't impeached or resigns before then
If you only knew how foolish you sound;repeating MSM BS. He will not resign nor will he be impeached. He's broken no laws.
Graham, all talk & no action KNOWS Trump's a traitor & still letting him appoint judge? Unconscionable!
Thank GOD, you'll never be my nurse! I prefer a sane nurse.

Prefer a incestuous freak as ya leader
Pre elect his words
Video witb Wendy Williams regarding sex and his daughter
You are demented! Seek professional help!
Me???

LMFAO DUDE THIS IS 110% LEGIT, LOOK IT UP FOR YOURSELF.
Keep in mind, this was from waaay back, pre election when he was Mr. Cool Guy
The only group who keeps bringing up the election outcome are the Rs. They seem to have the problem with it
Now that's ridiculous! Have you been sleeping for the last 2.5 months?!?
All these GOP Senators are ok with a Traitor in the WH as long as they get their SCOTUS pick. Sickening. I'm embarrassed to be American.
When the FBI is investigating him and his team for stealing the election of course Dems won't accept he won the election & hand over SCOTUS
But they're not... Dims are responsible! You Libs really should stop being so damn gullible. MSM keeps making fools of you.
Just when I thought you were one of the few Republicans who still had some integrity..bam..gone..hoping you lose your seat over this one
We hope he does too... so we can elect a REAL REPUBLICAN to replace him!
@LindseyGrahamSC You wanted to lead this country as POTUS -- now is your chance LEAD! Stop w/ the BS conspiracies & stand up against 45
This isn't about the election! Come on, @LindseyGrahamSC.
What happen to Merrick Garland's confirmation hearing?
You broke America's heart today.
Looks like you're actually a Trumpista. You're beginning to think & act just like Trumpty Dumpty!  Now you're playing to the clowns, too!
What is end game? Far right likes dark money, corrupt corpoations less tax for wealthy. Not good for economy. We cant just have upper class
Obama won the prior term and had a constitutional right to appoint a justice. Where was his conviction then?  Blatant partisan hypocrisy.
No Gorsuch vote until Trump TREASON is resolved
And we shall come to know he did so for a POTUS who picked a name off a list he neither wrote nor understood why these names were chosen!
Knew you would
@LindseyGrahamSC  Trivialized his constituents concerns instead of listening. Could have at least listened.
It will be a change bearing your name and regrettable forever
R's won't accept Obama was President when Garland was nominated
Because of the way Donald won the Republicans are nervous about it
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I just lost all respect forGraham. Russia "elected" Trump.
Yet they keep voting him in. Just don't get it
The election is over get over yourself. Act like a real government STOP PLAYING GAMES
Y'all never even gave #MerrickGarland a hearing. Obama won two elections and had a year left.  No Garland, No Gorsuch. #putzes
@LindseyGrahamSC & @SenateMajLdr won't accept that they're wrong. #StolenSeat. You broke this, not the Dems. The thievery is on you.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump here are your red state constituents turning on you
You never had the common courtesy of having a hearing for Merrick Garland. I left the party because of obstructionist crap you did. No! No!
And the American people will vote to change the Senate in 2018. Sick of GOP ignoring our Constitution & supporting a traitor & his nominee.
If you Vote to chg Senate Rules We will VOTE YOU OUT OF OFFICE You didn't give Merrick Garland a hearing let a lone a Vote Chg Nominee
The hypocrisy is dizzying. Obama won two elections and still wasn't allowed a vote on his nominee.
This was also said at the townhall. Very condescending. I am a dem who was willing to be open minded. Trump lost me at Bannon.
@LindseyGrahamSC Hopelessly Bonkers
we'd be fine if u had not stolen this nomination.  Give us Garland- you can have the next one under Trumpo.  but stealing ours...not ok.
What a fine group of old white men you have there. No confirmation before investigation.
I accept he won for now but will do everything I can to limit damage to our country until we can start sending GOP home in 2018.
Rs wouldn't accept Obama won election. you didn't have a problem denying 44's nominee. why the double standard? does it boil down to race?
Go ahead and change rules. Given how Trump is an embarrassment, Repubs will be in the minority VERY soon.
What we dont believe is that Garland was not even heard in the senate.
Cry baby!
What a short memory, Lindsey.  Do NOT forget #Garland
He didn't win a fair election, he won with Putins help, (and with the stupidity of backing from right to lifers- you all should be ashamed)
You sold out this country to make a single issue that the government isn't qualified to decide, go your way.
One is not a citizen until one is born. That's when the government recognizes your life and what they are qualified to regulate.

@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump This was not the Republicans nomination. It was STOLEN. I will never vote for another Repub.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Lindsey...He's under investigation and it's not about grabbing women pussies, it's worse.
I saw a news story  about Gram and McCain being lovers so I shared it  to all my Facebook groups
@LindseyGrahamSC Just like you and your party didn't accept that Obama was still the president in March 2016.
@bbodine18457 @realDonaldTrump he,s really had a change of heart
Did Obama not win the 2012 election!?  The seat you're pouting about is STOLEN, you mealymouthed HYPOCRITE!

Graham is a Dimocrat too! Thx to the Dims, we already have a option... GO NUCLEAR!
But he was fine with not even giving Obama's nominee the courtesy of a vote. Hypocrite
Unlike how the GOP totally accepted that Obama won the election? KMA @LindseyGrahamSC
I voted for @LindseyGrahamSC last election and will NEVER do so again. You've lost my respect, sir.

"Donald Trump s a race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot." - @LindseyGrahamSC January 2016 @EvanWilt_
Today we have a GOP that is thankful for the Trump victory and that we #SavedtheSenate!
Do Republican's forget what they did to Garland and even said if Hillary won they would stop her from nominating anyone.
For you to do that makes you just as dirty as anyone you criticize.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump No Sir. We reject your obstructionism and Trump's legitimacy. J
No lifetime apptmnt while @POTUS is investigated #TrumpRussiaCollusion #TrumpRussiaCoverUp @realDonaldTrump Reps should #GOVERN #DoYourJob
And Graham spoke out at his last Town Hall about how he didn't like or vote for Trump!  LOL
Senator Graham, i wouldvreally live to know what makes you think you&your party have a right to change the rules just to suit your party?
If he does then expect the democrats to take all of the republicans' power away when their time comes. Divided we fall.
Dems are mad that DT is Pres not that a Rep is President. Don't underestimate the engaged and angry resistance. Dems are getting an earful.
Not a smart thing to say, Lindsey.
So basically destroy the institution.
@realDonaldTrump may be an illegitimate POTUS, due to collision with the Russians. His judge shouldn't be confirmed until that is resolved.
Blahahahahahaha!
Lost a lot of respect that I had gained for Graham in one instant BOOM. Mr Graham, this is not right and you know it.

The hypocrisy makes all such arguments ring so hollow that the shell of legitimacy surrounding them has more cracks than our nation's roads.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Why bother having rules at all if you can change them anytime they don't fit your agenda
Just like Rs didnâ€™t accept that Obama won in 2012? By stonewalling his SCOTUS nominee?
R's had enough seats to stonewall back then, as it does to go nuclear now. What does D's have? Lol
Not sure I understand your point. Dems have the fact that, w/o any basis other than "we don't like Obama," Repubs refused to hold hearings.
My point is that when you lost majority in senate, there are consequences
D.Trump is under FBI investigation, let's clear that up first.  Let's try a little common sense shall we.
WRONG. Gorsuch is the WRONG candidate. NO to his agenda of bigotry & unrealistic originalist philosophies that WILL undermine our rights.
@LindseyGrahamSC  Bottom feeder
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump kiss ass Graham
What difference does it make, they already vote to give the country to Russia, what is one more institution. Let them tear it all down.
LYING CHEATERS! Yall hate it when Ds get tough, but Rs lie, cheat, and steal ur way to what YOU want and fuck the rest of us! I hate u all!

Nothing to do with election, Lindsey. MERRICK GARLAND and GOP bigoted obstructionism. Gorsuch bought and paid for by dark money.
@GrahamBlog as your new constituent and a dem, trying 2 support you but this is wrong.
Merrill Garland? Hoping people won't remember?
