My statement on the United Nations resolution on Israel settlements. 
That's a strange perception of democracy: Support my views because I have the money #HumanRightsvsMoney
Democracy? The UN is a voluntary organization and it's also basically a fraud. Stop U.S. Aid!
How the decisions are taken?
.@ricardoibarra84 @SenTedCruz @LindseyGrahamSC
This is excellent thank you for sharing!
Lot's of great 5 minute videos at http://PragerU.com  & I share them often.
I luv the app. Not looked in awhile. Love it when libs can't come back from facts
We need to not only stop funding them but withdraw from the UN and kick them out of NY. Let them set up in Europe
yeah let's all live in the woods and pretend we don't have to interact with other human beings.
Another Globalist Progressive heard from
????
Not through the anti-Semetic UN. They do need to be defunded and kicked out of New York.
and what about us funding to Israel?
What eve keep backing your Muslim Friends
the UK, Russia, Spain, Francw etc all supported this resolution and u think USA and veto the world
@LindseyGrahamSC Russia voted in favor of the resolution ........
America first . Not israel not Russia not anyone
no it's not and what's good for israel isn't always good for America
they won't be destroyed and we're smart enough no matter who is pres to step in before that pt
@LindseyGrahamSC Israeli settlements don't bring peace. Stop pandering to war-mongers and religious zealots.
You, apparently, are a white egg on a green background.
@LindseyGrahamSC What we learned from campaign is that no one likes you; not even your colleagues! Time to send you packing 
@LindseyGrahamSC Better late then never.  Too long Congress has done little/nothing to stay UN,either by vetoing or no funding
In other words, the USA will become the world's bully. Who the hell thinks this is a good idea? What's in it for Trump?
Stop funding Israel until they stop building illegal settlements.
you better be sure it wasn't your own President that set it up!
Ignore liberal hate @SenTedCruz. You are a patriot who defends our Constitution. If libs hate you you're doing something right!
Libs are tax payers. Watch your mouth. We feed you. Welfare= Red states.
Most of the 47% who don’t pay income taxes almost definitely don’t vote GOP.
he's part of 47% that does not pay taxes.
And you know this….how? Funny given that he did not realize his tax returns. (And this is why…lib talking points)
he said so. Ffs. So he's a liar and I should ignore him.
If you do not actually have income in a year…on what should you INCOME taxes?
@LindaSuhler @LindseyGrahamSC You support the boob who wouldn't honor his pledge ??? You and he preferred Ohillary over Trump !
It's about the principle & not @LindseyGrahamSC
@LindseyGrahamSC Palestinians have a right of protection from aggression.  Their lands and lives, sacred too
@LindseyGrahamSC I don't support such a move. We must always be engaged with the UN.
Such blatant bullying. The world body has declared settlements must stop. You are isolating the US on this.
Use the U.N building as the new illegal alien processing criminal out processing center!
@LindaSuhler About time we withdrew and kicked them out. They are nothing but #AntiAmerican and detrimental to our sovereignty.
@LindseyGrahamSC 
Creepy greedy politicians 
I hope you have the worst 
4 years ever.

I have a King James Bible that I read daily. It is the foundation of my faith as a Christian. I cannot abandon the Jews.
@LindseyGrahamSC Arent the settlements illegal? Does that matter? Or is this just to keep AIPAC money coming?
.@DizzyCars @SenTedCruz @LindseyGrahamSC
.@DizzyCars @SenTedCruz @LindseyGrahamSC
.@SenTedCruz .@LindseyGrahamSC so basically, if they DON'T DO AS WE SAY, then to hell with them! The USA's way or the HIGHWAY...
UN is a fraud.
.@Lynn_Rose1 .@SenTedCruz .@LindseyGrahamSC My bad, what was I thinking? It's the United Nations not the United States (of America)...
.@dogwar007 @SenTedCruz @LindseyGrahamSC
.@dogwar007 @SenTedCruz @LindseyGrahamSC
You all know that Israel supports a Palestinian state? All the Pals gotta do is leave Israel alone and all is good!
stop sending Israel $10-11 billion a day in aid when their citizens get free college and health care
@LindseyGrahamSC can't believe US did not veto UN resolution. Only Israel & Jordan r our friends in M E
aww look,the slaves of zionists who are in israels pockets have a problem with illegal terrorist state of israel getting dropped
Glad to hear this.l!
Jesus, Ted! Has everyone in the Republican party lost their minds?!
Once again, GOP makes us fair weather friends of allies, this time for blank check allegiance to Bibi @ expense of Palestine.
@LindseyGrahamSC how bout you stop the over 300 billion you give Israel and use it here for our country.
@LindseyGrahamSC Green eggs & ham ..
They don't even try to veil their betrayal of American interests. They've been so deeply corrupted they don't care.
@conens46 @LindseyGrahamSC I support it too.
@LindseyGrahamSC
@LindseyGrahamSC It's working; just got 38 billion.
@LindseyGrahamSC
CUT UN funding, STOP subsidy of nations who persecute Christians, #UNSC in league with haters #ccot #pjnet
A doormat for (((them)))...you must feel very proud of yourself..When WILL the USA stop being a doormat for Israel?
Why do we not just pack up UN and send to Switzerland? Reduce our crime rate in NY and keep funds we waste there. UN is useless
@LindseyGrahamSC can't allow US govt prima donnas to not stand w/ UN. Be part of global soln's, not the problem. Rogue move Ted
thank u sir! Because of people like you I can say, I Love the GREAT state of TEXAS!
@LindseyGrahamSC I didn't think you 2 could be any less intelligent... but here you go again.  #TryingToDestroyTheWorld
Putin and his cabinet are laughing at the new administration and crones like you. #2018. #russianhacking #hatchact #BlueTexan
I support investgation into Russian Interference and Donald & Tillerson's conflict of interest, I'm a Texan #2018.
Your level of tacky has no ground.
YEAH! Together we'll make America a nation as universally hated as Russia! And it won't take long! Thanks for your support Ted!
@LindseyGrahamSC Shut up Ted. No one listens to you.
Because the last time we did something like that all it resulted in was the rise of Hitler and WWII.
@LindseyGrahamSC So happy to hear this #StandWithIsrael
@LindseyGrahamSC I support that!
@LindseyGrahamSC Your avatar makes you look like Count Dracula. 

That being said, I suppose it's appropriate in a way.
@LindseyGrahamSC Use the money we DON'T send to the UN to pay back the Social Security fund, where the bulk of our debt is held
@LindseyGrahamSC When will Israel start giving us money,and start fighting our wars ?
sure, it's what lackeys are supposed to say.
@LindseyGrahamSC cut 'em off.
@StacyBrewer18 How about just dropping from the UN altogether....it is a scam and not in our best interest!
@LindseyGrahamSC wow he must be listening to our new president
@LindseyGrahamSC Don't Threaten it...DO IT!!!  Get those anti-American bastards out of the US and let SOMEONE ELSE pay for it!!
ITS ABOUT TIME WE TAKE A STAND.
any wonder you got your ass kicked?
We do also, have for past decade or more
@LindseyGrahamSC 
I'd love to see polling of Amer citizens' opinion of Israeli settlements.  My bet is vast majority are FOR.
@rlockrocks
@LindseyGrahamSC Thank you Ted. I hope it's not just words but action to back it up. UN is the largest hate group in the world
.@SenTedCruz Im wondering since obviously they'd rather control us than work w/US Why cant we evict them all send to Brussels #EU vs #UN
shame on you!
Proud of Cruz and Graham. 
Can't wait for Trump...Jan20th can't come soon enough!
WTF?
Actually READ ur Bible!!!
.  But..But..didn't you and Lindsey have cardic arrest when President Trump recommended this, I could be wrong about you.
@BayShoreIsHome @LindseyGrahamSC The UN is not our friend, thus we should be supporting it in any way.
, I would stop funding it and tell it to move out of our country.
The UN land would make a great casino location....
or a Trump 5 star hotel/luxury apartment.
I love you guys, but the nation has voted and the Trump train is in charge now. Let us do our thing.
- Once in a Blue Moon, "Amnesty- Open Borders" Graham apparently DOES have a conservative thought. 
Great deal. Should have been done years ago. Make America Great Again.
@SirYussly @LindseyGrahamSC why notsupport @realDonaldTrump and make a difference vs your status quo empty senate floor speech
@AnnVandersteel Sen. Cruz should say, "I support ending all foreign aid and leaving the UN b/c they're unconstitutional"
So u basically admit to using US aid as a way to make sure foreign countries always vote/act in ur favour?
@_CFJ_ @LindseyGrahamSC stop the funding and kick them out of our country...the UN is a useless org and a waste of money
@LindseyGrahamSC #UN Fund but verify. Our money requires alligence. Not ever a fan of the RINO brothers.
I would go farther. Drop the UN and develop a better orgn for Democratic nations of good will.
Since when is coercion and blackmail democratic? You remind me of Al Capone and his idea of democracy. Do it my way or else....
@LindseyGrahamSC world doesn't need US.. they have Russia & China
Aid to any country should be reconsidered on a yearly basis. No cooperation, NO MONEY!  And we can cut the UN contribution now!
@cerenomri @LindseyGrahamSC 
Then , by default, ur giving China and Russia a great chance here .
@LindseyGrahamSC . You can't always get what you want. Can't defund the UN because you don't like a resolution. 
: Stop funding the UN period. Year after year they're worse and they will never change. Let US leave it.
If ever there was a sign that the U.S. no longer leads the world...
@FlyoverCulture @LindseyGrahamSC Wow, for once I agree with RHINO Graham!
Names should be taken; examples should be made; Senegal & New Zealand.
no surprise Cruz&Graham are both isolationist
@LindseyGrahamSC Weren't Cruz and Graham freak out when DJT said similar?
The UN is useless as tits on a boar.
@LindseyGrahamSC is the biggest RINO we the people dont want you our john McCain huge mistakes to reelect people in wikileaks
@LindseyGrahamSC I have heard it is Obamas dream to become Secretary General of the UN. Do you think that's a possibility?
then let the UN relocate to Communist China
@LindseyGrahamSC the
Yes, Yes ,Yes!
@PatVPeters @LindseyGrahamSC I also support it! First thing he's proposed recently I have agreed with! Should B easy 2 suspend!
Seems to me the time is right for the U.S. to leave the UN or at the very least reduce our very disportionate funding.
@LindseyGrahamSC I support you and Senator Graham.

@DrMartyFox Great idea Lindsey. That will work. Keep after the U N. Stop our money flow.
Even a broken clock is right twice a day.
@LindseyGrahamSC  about time!
@LindseyGrahamSC what are the specifics?
I have little use of Senator Graham,however, NOT providing the U.N. with a building and funding is a GREAT START!!!
 you! Proud to call you my Senator. Stand strong, show them ur moxie! Stop the communist/Islamic/globalist spread.
There are many more reasons for not supporting that bunch of losers. F the UN.
I'd bet the majority of Americans agree!! We only need one "United" governing us - the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
@gatewaypundit makes sense for once
Get the U.S. out of the UN and the UN out of the U.S.! Do it now!
I do also...But I must add that this is about the only thing I support coming from @LindseyGrahamSC
@LindseyGrahamSC 
Finally, someone is doing something. A Patriotic Act
@gatewaypundit @LindseyGrahamSC I don't support @LindseyGrahamSC period. Petty little man. I support Israel though.
Bloomberg poll found that 1/3 of Republicans  would support Israel even if contrary to US interests. America First?
@davereaboi @LindseyGrahamSC
@LindseyGrahamSC Isn't that essentially coercion?
@cerenomri not the two brightest bulbs on the senatorial chandelier.
who are the brightest to you, Reid or Schumer?
Thank you Senator Cruz. The UN started with noble intentions but has been hijacked by dictators, thugs, and islamists
UN Headquarters needs to be in Saudi Arabia @realDonaldTrump @700club @kimguilfoyle @KellyRiddell  @SandraSmithFox @ericbolling
@DavidBCohen1 @LindseyGrahamSC why blame other countries when your president makes such a weasel move?
@LindseyGrahamSC I think it's pathetic that you condemn this but are silent on your PE's lunatic saber rattling. Wake up!
@cerenomri bc you are a duck Ted
@LindseyGrahamSC  ug stay away from him Ted
YES!
Boo on Israel haters! Really, boo!
#Russia and #Crimea , #China and #Tibet, #Spain and #Ceuta + #melilla, #France and its colonies, #UK and #falklands
Does anyone actually care what you think?
Time to make the UN understand that if we're paying a quarter of their budget they can't be going against our allies like this!
@LindseyGrahamSC Obama made the wrong choice in UN vote!
Support
You have my full support, senator.
Let us hope this is the beginning of the end for U.N.
We need a coalition of United Democratic Nations to replace this travesty.
#DefundTheUN NOW!
@POTUS @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems @SenateGOP @SenTedCruz  @realDonaldTrump #tcot
be careful senator who will turn on you
Why we would give millions to countries that hate us is beyond me. Congress is so inept we simply don’t need them
why don't you do a bit of research as to what is spent and how? I thought you guys are Christian, but
Reasearch...never gove in to their demand...once you do you have lost.
@WendyDamron @LindseyGrahamSC or how about we stop all aid when we can't even pay our own bills? 
@LindseyGrahamSC more settlements just cause more hardship to the Palestinian people. Love peace #stopshittyideas
@LindseyGrahamSC statements like these are the reason you lost to Donald Trymp. Why not work for a peaceful solution.
@LindseyGrahamSC Right on.
@LindseyGrahamSC Not only defund, tell them to go to HELL & the sooner the better! Kick them out of the U.S. & save taxpayer $$$
why are still a member of the horrible organization #quit UN
every country is a member dumbo
why not stop funding Israel? we give them far more than the UN.
Make it happen. Kick those bastards out of our country completely.
@consmover Stop all foreign aide to  countries voting to sanction Isreal!!!
Please take action Senator! Don't be like @POTUS and his silly 'redline' in Syria.
you're on the wrong side of history! Israeli Occupation&apartheid is coming to an end! 14-0! #FreePalestine
@realDonaldTrump CUT OFF ALL UN FUNDING,  GET THE UN OUT OF OUR COUNTRY
@LindseyGrahamSC 
Not funding UN makes us a weaker power w/worldwide diminished respect for the US
DT needs $ for NY security?
"Reconsider?"  How about "not a damn dime to terrorist-supporting anti-Semites like PLA/UN?"  #LetThemEatSand
@benweinthal @UN We're taking you down.  You sealed it.
Relocate the UN to Mogadishu.
WHEREVER!!!!!!!!!
you should support UN res.&stop supporting brutal Occupation&illegal settlements! #FreePalestine  no blackmail!
@Ezinger44 @LindseyGrahamSC and kick the UN out of the US too
If they can't build then the assumption is that it is not theirs and will be taken back. Doubt that's gonna happen peacefully.
@LindseyGrahamSC Christians are counting on you to do something about this!
@LindaSuhler funny how they attacked Trump earlier this year when he said the same thing. He's ahead of the curve
@LindseyGrahamSC lol like Trump ever pays his bill's...
@Airdale268 Go for it Ted. Time to end this foolishness. U.N. has become a tool of 3rd world U.S. haters. Time 2 move embassy.🕆
Sir, if you think backing Netanyahu's racist policies will get you past Saint Peter, you're kidding yourself. Maybe its the $$?
@LindseyGrahamSC great job. Do it. Draw the line in the sand
I can't believe he said it!
