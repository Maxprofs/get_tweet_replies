This traitor inherited one of the most stablized countries in the world. And he and his parasitic traitorous family has f-cked it up.
Is spelled Trump wrong Obama trauma treason liar crooked Muslim
When he ran for office and assumed the role he purposefully took on management of NK as is. Stop blaming the past for his unpreparedness.
Why could ur Messiah blame everyone 4 the mess in2008. Did he ask 2 Lead. Be fair
The bigger question is why wasnt our govt in prev. admin. proactive in averting  these #crises? diplomacy goes so far. Dems created crisis

This mess has been around for generations. He's making it worse. Don't make excuses for him.
Graham & Trump grow up! Every president encounters ongoing challenges when entering office. Grow a pair and work through the issues #resist
Don't set around looking for someone to blame. Everything is not Obama's, Bush's, or Clinton's fault. Pretend to be men. #resist #whinemuch
Every President since 1953 'inherited a mess'; there is no good answer - but acting like a child also doesn't help.  Listen to Generals!
Stop saying he inherited a mess, he is THE MESS.
Eisenhower inherited a mess on the peninsula and so has every President since. The mess is not unique to 45; his response is.
@FoxNews I will turn the channel everytime you    put @LinseyGraham on. This guy does not represent anyone anymore. Probably the Democrats.
All you responding I am sure are from the liberal left Democrats who has been lulled into complicity for the last eight years
Far vedere la potenza militare tenendo segrete le nuove armi tecnologiche
Lindsey Graham is part of the mess that was created.  No credibility.
@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC @POTUS stop north Korea then. Do what Reagan did put bombs Europe put them south Korea and Japan
The "mess" has existed for decades. We already had a war with N Korea. It's time for all of us to think our way through. War won't work.
The only mess is the one trump has created and republicans cover for when Mueller gets the truth Americans will hold republicans responsible
I find it amazing when #America is in a #crisis situation, the blaming & criticism & we shoulda,woulda,coulda mindset by #senators & #media
North Korea has always been a mess. @POTUS is just doing a horrible job handling the situation.
He has created many messes
In 220 days Trump gave NKorea & Iran the money 2 make nukes. Are u nuts!!!

45 created it for himself. Can't keep his Twitter hole shut. Do you really hate a black man that much Lindsey? Didn't have this under 44.
Inherited?
And just what did Lindsay & all his colleagues do to stop N. Korea. Nothing do why should the
nothing self only people have any say.  RINO
@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC @POTUS Trump said during the election to let south Korea, japan get nuclear bomb i bet china will
Let it Rain.
Inherited a mess! He made the mess he is in. OWN IT!
MAY THE GODS HAVE MERCY ON ALL SINGAPOREANS....
awww really..duh you think?
So we don't need troops in Venezuela? Nah, we just wait till the last minute for Iran to put their nukes there aiming at us. Nepotist!
Lindsey Graham is no military expert- just likes every Neocon War. W/  ISIS in so many countries, soldiers in Afghanistan don't stop a 9-11
I think it's pretty damn close hoping USA don't react after the effect This time I don't think I'd be like that POTUS the right ppl guiding
The White House inherited a mess and his name is Trump
Stand by-- Watch what real leader does w/ problems. Just like energy revival & jobs.
Inherited maybe, maybe not.  Exacerbated, absolutely
I guess you mean he inherited it from Eisenhower, otherwise you're a complete no-nothing!
If Potus wasn't up for the job then get the hell out the kitchen   Stop complaining and send Jared to do his job.
Absolutely true. These two leaders are looking for a game to play with people lives.
Not on a collision course with North Korea. That's Trump and Putin BS you're pushing. And if we are Fox News r you willing to Die For This
North Korea is a pimple on the butt of the world I say we pop it turn it into a prison for all these Thug we have here
Inherited a mess...what a stupid comment. NK has always been stupid but no president outside of this idiot is trying to instigate a war
Graham is an idiot so anything he says is pretty much like taking a shit
Millions of innocent people will suffer the consequences of yours and the traitor in office
your right when north Korea bombs us Obama did nothing but hide under his desk like
Sure did inherit a MESS! Thank u Barack for ur incompetent leadership!

FOR US/USA& WORLD,,,THE DEAL IS OFF!
& YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S MEANS?????!!!
No he did not!!! Quit protecting this mad man.
He fueled the fire by saying Japan and South Korea should have nukes. Don't put this on everyone else. Trump needs to shut his mouth.

No inherited
Remember when Obama couldn't blame Bush for what he inherited?  Yeah, good times.
100% right.
Yes he did...YOU & the other Senate RINOS.
North Korea has been on the table of President's since the 1950's Trump is the 1st POTUS to take the carrot off the stick & poke N Korea
OMG he's the first one to act like a childish bully He's a disgrace to this great nation
Remember #TrumpRussia!
Just retire with Ur 100 million dollar pal McCain
