Not at all, I was talking about his supporters. No Nazi
Cutting of funding because the UN did not align with views on extremely controversial settlements?
@JesseRodriguez @Morning_Joe. Sir, stand up to Trump, he is endangering our Nation. Dictatorial
@JesseRodriguez @Morning_Joe Israel has no respect 4 US. Only use faux respect when they want something.
but you allow them to stay in USA and to use USA resources. hmmmm  throw them out! evict them !
I thought u got banned from msnbc?

Graham Cracker should have traitor McCain on with him.
Tillerson. DO NOT VOTE FOR HIM!
@JesseRodriguez @Morning_Joe  The USA policy has ALWAYS been against illegal settlements nd 2 states
@JesseRodriguez @Morning_Joe Wrongheaded signal to the world that we will deny people aid and assistance
#MorningJoe Republican-led Senate,probe this weird breach of US Intel:What if it had been real info?
Mazel Tov !!!!

@JesseRodriguez @Morning_Joe Cuttin UN funding is a short sighted slap 4 org we should embrace

.@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBCMorningJoe Senator Graham, you & @SenJohnMcCain are the reason we NEED term limits. Pure neocon warmonger/globalists

@JesseRodriguez @Morning_Joe And its a outrageous ridiculous idea. My God, no fucking wonder you lost Lind
@JesseRodriguez @Morning_Joe The columns of the #capitol did not tumble when u 2 appeared. Tks. #vigilance
@JesseRodriguez @Morning_Joe please address @realDonaldTrump voter's who call @LindseyGrahamSC a traitor
NO! This American not in favor of cutting off UN funding. Israel's settlement policy amounts to bullying.
Your fascination with Israel is disturbing.
great cut them off
@JesseRodriguez @Morning_Joe look ypu@seem like a nice guy, stop hanging out with the zodiac killer!!
I'm glad you found something productive to do unlike your BFF @SenJohnMcCain.
@JesseRodriguez @Morning_Joe 
I can't believe the way you're acting.  Undermining Mr Trump at every turn..
@JesseRodriguez @Morning_Joe I hope you don't vote for Tillerson, or are you afraid of Trump..
@JesseRodriguez @Morning_Joe I'm amazed.Joe seems to be on the wagon.  Go hard Senator
@LoveuLynn @MSNBCMorningJoe Lindsey to afraid to go on O'Reilly. Likes his libs on Joey show. Such a complete fraud.
. Trump is a Bully & a Dictator, he does as he pleases and nobody has the guts to stop him. What is wrong with your Peers
@JesseRodriguez @Morning_Joe @tedcruz because trump knows how to put u in ur place!
@JesseRodriguez @Morning_Joe Wow Lindsey, u truly deserve what @realDonaldTrump said about u yesterday!!
You have found your niche, Senator....You fit right in with that crowd.
The rest of the world is looking at you and laughing. The UN is RIGHT on the Israel issue.
thank you for being the most pro Israel and pro democracy member of the senate
Mistake to do so.
It kind of smells like extortion.
@JesseRodriguez @Morning_Joe Linsey should stay n Capital hill and represent SC instead of going on shows
@JesseRodriguez @Morning_Joe -please stop attacking President elected Trump!
Thank U for your stance on Russia. Not sure what will happen after the 20th - he didn't even know when questioned by press
@JesseRodriguez @Morning_Joe please vote no on Tillerson, it's totally corrupt!
We need to cut back on funding Israel until they stop building settlements on Palestinian land
@JesseRodriguez @Morning_Joe punishment for a difference of opinion/vote is extreme prejudice w/ bullying
And....we can't afford to leave Russiaxand China with so much UN power without us there!!!
Agree with you on Russia. Thank you!

But--I think UN pull out is dangerous mistake.
@JesseRodriguez @Morning_Joe a bit childish don't you think?
I think you meant in response to treatment of the 50% of Israel that side with Bibi.
Wouldn't even be an issue if Adelson wasn't spending $50M giving away right wing newspapers.
Stop the partisanship! UN is too important to align yourself with the buffoon Trump!
@JesseRodriguez @Morning_Joe PUTIN state-owned oil company make LOTS money if sanctions lifted. Exxon ties
@JesseRodriguez @Morning_Joe u need to cut off funding to DJT,
Sorry...I no longer watch @MSNBCMorningJoe. Talk about #fakenews.
@JesseRodriguez @Morning_Joe what about Rex Tillerson's Muslim registry response?
Simple question senator, do you believe in the two state solution or not?
@JesseRodriguez @Morning_Joe Oh I don't know but wouldn't you want to speak on Trump and RUSSIA?

You are WRONG on this issue.  The settlements are disastrous.
It's startling that GOP now can't see a rare alliance opportunity w. Abbas that almost never happens.
LG, do you get dizzy running back & forth, sort of like a lab=>deed done where's my tweet? LOL
Contradiction to HW Bush stance, and JamesBaker already has gone on air to say he supports Obamas action.
Noted: Sen. Graham
@JesseRodriguez @Morning_Joe 

#GreenEggsAndHam
TRAITOR
Member states voted, UN just an arena. That'd be like cutting $ to Cong library because of Harry Reid
Treatment of Israel by whom? come on now
