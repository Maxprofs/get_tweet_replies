.@LindseyGrahamSC: "If thousands die, they’re going to die over there" on @TODAYshow
You do know that Graham is a surrogate.. right? https://twitter.com/welltraveledfox/status/892362060826333184 …
If Wikileaks is your source, you do know you're reposting Russian proganda?
Odd. Everyone adored Wikileaks when they outed Bush era wrongdoings & all those damning Russian diplomatic cables that made Putin so angry.
Not everyone. Not me. And not sure when Assange & Wikileaks became wholly beholdened to the Kremlin. But it happened. It's obvious.
Are you familiar with the fact that origination source code, called DKIM in the case of Google, is admissable in courts worldwide?
Their servers are kept in Russia. They spew talking points that might as well come straight from the Kremlin. They've only posted...
things that help Donald &/or hurt the US, in the past year+. They are now trying to smear Mueller w omitted info. If you can't see it...
And to "destroy North Korea itself"?  So now you're openly advocating mass homicide? Initiating a nuclear holocaust?    Endangering allies?
What's the alternative? What is your idea to stop the threat?
Stop the useless grandstanding
What's your alternative? Hugs and kisses? Diplomacy hasn't worked. Our president has poked NK and get them all riled up. So what is left.
Do you realize how many decades the Kim regime has been making this threat? But somehow now is the moment to act?  We only have one planet.
And now the fucknut has a missle that can reach us.
And Iraq had "weapons of mass destruction" that Saddam planned to use against us.  See how well that worked out?
Right. Except now, we have seen the missle. We know it exists. We know it can reach us. But let's wait. Because I'm sure he's just kidding.

We will. They are our soldiers, Marines, and sailors. And they will go proudly and bravely.
Not all of them are Trump supporters
No, but they are all patriots.
My son already been to DMZ  and multiple tours to Afghanistan.
I salute you son
#2020anybodybutlindseygraham
Ok, the Republican Party is desperate to go to war with NK in order to look like they can accomplish something, anything.
I see the USA burning down like a dry wooden house if you longer thinking you can run the world by war !
Not only disgusting, but sophomoric, ignorant, and reckless statement by Graham. @NBCNews @MLauer @LindseyGrahamSC @TODAYshow
Um...South Korea would like a word
What about China, Russia, Japan, have they a say????
Hi  as close neighbor , of the country wanting to become the most hated in the world (if not already) my say is NO
(Classic Canadian - even polite in their request for us to not blow up the planet) 
:)
And what is wrong with a Canadian...or me as an Aussie.spelling  out the Facts to all the brainwashed or is it Braindead,supporters of Trump
nothing at all.  I'm on the right side of history. just trying to lighten the mood, Mr. Nitzkevich.
Are you serious?..Brainwashed or Braindead,is all i can see..Yes Comedy has been the great winner,with this total incompetent in the chair..
As daughter of #Hiroshima survivor, I'm appalled & saddened by Mr Graham's cavalier response esp.near 72nd anniv  #thelastcherryblossom
AMEN to that too!
What?!
Yes, creating a refugee crisis in North Korea on the scale of that in Syria is obviously the best solution! We deserve better than that.
Certainly #China will gladly accept any and all #Korean refugees with open arms, hands, and much love  #OpenBorders #BuildBridgesNotWalls
Tough-talking Ms Lindsey! We know that he's in the AF, but has he ever been in the front lines and in the middle of a fire fight?
Graham:Have u lost your mind-destroy NK-not just program?We don't need WWIII.Did u notice how close our allies r/do their lives not matter?
Stupidity in a response...so Graham wants to see 1M+ deaths in less than 24 hrs? Because everyone who's familiar knows that's a reality
Predictions aren't http://facts.How  many deaths if nuke hits LA? Can't let KJU hold USA by balls, time to act.
I agree with this but I've been doing some thinking:

#Shitlibs, many of whom live on the US West Coast & in LA, seem to oppose military...
...action against #DPRK. Here's their reasonings:
1. Kim is not the aggressor, he's engaging in "self-preservation";
2. Action in DPRK is...
...a #Russia distraction;
3. Kim wants peace, poses no threat, but no one will talk to him.

So IF the shitlibs are right, then we have...
...nothing to worry about. Let's leave #DPRK alone. Let Kim do as he pleases. And IF the day comes when he fires an #ICBM  toward #LA...
...that proves successful, the #USA will save over $1B on security costs for the 2028 Olympics, @TheDemocrats will lose 55 - 80 EVs,...
Did Lindsey Graham just say, on Tisha b'Av no less, that the US would destroy NK to stop them getting a nuclear weapon? They will bomb LA...
Resign
These clueless idiots are insane and going to start WW3
I see you are on your favorite fake news network. You are sucha liar, IMHO.
Antichrist Zionist #Israel have 300 nuclear missiles how about denucleraze zios

https://youtu.be/L033M6wqNCI  @realDonaldTrump
Graham is a ghoul; Attempted mass murderer.
After you, Lindsey. Here's your helmet
Same America yapping about "foreign interference"
They will have their war.  The location seems to be, at this point, irrelevant.  But was is foming and it will be bad.  Prepare accordingly.
These old ugly #insane #warmonger @LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain love war and dead civilians.Send both to NK to fight themselves

#NoMoreWar
@LindseyGrahamSC is more dangerous to America & the entire world than Hitler
JESUS!

That makes sense. Like hiding in a glass closet for 62 yrs.  Vaporize 25 million to neutralize 1 #grahamcrackers
.@MLauer: What's the best military option?

@LindseyGrahamSC: To destroy North Korea’s program & North Korea itself  
And hopefully a nice and shiny nuke lands on the great Satan in North America
other wise you have as many opinions as there are senators. and complete misdirection from W/H
Did you get mixed up??? Why are you asking him?? Gen.Mattis is the only person Americans listen to, in answer to that question.
U can't destroy an entire country because you are afraid of them. If they actually do something, we can respond, but N.K. people R innocent.
I am a supporter of you & McCain. But, until we get a competent Commander in Chief, military action will be far more disastrous then needed!
Ouch Lindsey! The little guy is seeking attention. Big difference in "hey, don't forget about me!" How about talking to this Prez/dictator?
Why is he looking at Hoda when Matt asked the question?
North Korea will counter American aggression by complimenting trumps crowd sizes and political acumen Trump would then surrender
Bravo!
Quick! Wave your shiny keys in front of Trump to distract him.  It'll make all this go away.
There's only a teeny tiny little problem about that: China
Sen Graham < I hope you're not serious. There is no such thing as "over there" when it comes to nuclear war/radiation fallout. #NorthKorea
Exactly! #TheResistence
Crazy pills
@RepBrianFitz @sentoomey #PA voters want #peace #nonukes #nowar #GOP so wrong! @codepink @bcpagreens @GreenPartyUS #fridayswithfitzpatrick
FFS is there anyone in the media with the balls or intelligence to say this is insane and the American ppl don't want another "conflict".
Stop glorifying this war drum beating nonsense. This is journalistic malpractice.
He is a horrendous person
You ARE aware, @sengraham2016 WE CREATED North Korea! HERE WE GO AGAIN! Build up, tear down!
He understands that most people who live in North Korea have nothing to do with any of this, right?
Graham and Kim are both insane.
What a pair of nutjobs.
Mad guys of United States of Arrogance. USA wasn't this before.
Lindsey Graham is a warmonger servient to his military industrial complex masters. Everything he says, by all practical standards, is a lie.
Make no mistake, thousands of Americans will DIE in any armed conflict in Asia. Our current president does not comprehend reality on this.
A lot of people casting criticism here. But I agree with Graham, it's time for a military option on NK.
Only American politicians can get away with genocidal statements apparently.
nuke another country, what a brilliant idea !
finest american idiocracy
that dangerous criminal shouldn't live free
So much for our ally South Korea. Literally the stupidest idea I have ever heard from him. Seoul is right nxt 2 N Korean border.
Why India needed nukes badly. To protect ourselves from such madmen with nukes!
we r behind our president attack n. korea u cannot reason with a fool,while u r talking he is testing missiles remember japan ww2
#WednesdayWisdom   

Intro to Pure Evil! #TheUnitedStatesOfBarbarica!
Kindly submit your resignation & seek treatment for your genocidal mania...stay away from #Politics

Or

You're Fired! #IfIHadPower @USAgov
If they Nuke NK wil that impact cliamte in #Pakistan and China
Fallout 5 confirmed
Lol and what? You guys think North Korea won't fire a nuke at Japan and South Korea? Lovely stuff even if they shoot it down millions die.
Senator Graham hopefully faces 24h surveillance for suggesting mass murder in office. That's a national secures threat. Unbelievable.
Our government is just too dumb to make these kinds of decisions.
Hell yeah becoming an even bigger pariah state than the DPRK is an EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD IDEA.
Graham is a sociopath who loves war.
Graham always eager for people dying "over there". I'd imagine South Koreans might disagree. Why must we suffer deranged people like him?
So are you saying that with all that massive budget spent on defense you can't stop a single  missile!!!!
Graham is the most complete & utter azzhole ever to "represent" a great Nation. He should be committed to an asylum.
He said military option, not nuclear. So he could be talking about conventional, which is much more profitable anyways for the MIC.
Send Trump and his family. They seem to be untouchable!
Lindsey Graham is an ass I would rather what is wrong with killing our enemies and not allowing them to injure Americans they started this
someone had to get rid of that loser he is a waste of oxygen and has a retarded hair cut
If North Korea fires a targeted missile first, intercept the missile, then respond. Do not do preemptive war!
C4 up Rodman. When they bro hug remotely detonate said C4. Problem solved
Lindsey Graham is a horrendous person
You've gone nuts!
True.
Interesting u want your country to go to war when your top donors are defence contractors
Thank you @LindseyGrahamSC for having the common sense & courage to state the truth. #StrikeNOW
@LindseyGrahamSC should spend time legislating and reading instead of yapping on interview shows continuously.  And you need to stop asking.
Great reassuring message to our allies: If we are threatened you will be sacrificed.
@LindseyGrahamSC  YOU ARE NOT A HUMAN BEING
I'm curious to hear if Sen. Graham has good reason to believe China won't send a very large Army to defend North Korea as it did in 1950
this such an obviously terrible idea that will cause more problems than it will solve that I find it hard to believe they wont do it
Graham as #Trump , since his duplicitous #healthcare vote didn't fool anyone: suggest we destroy two countries and see how that plays.
@Harlan please run and spare our nation this lunatic. Many thanks. 
Do you hear yourselves?! You sound like Nazis! Let's destroy them!
That's certainly strong and straight forward. Must admit, I understand his point
Lindsay Graham has completely lost his mind and doesn't know the first thing about what ramifications there would be for S. Korea..
NBC's actual question, "Is this good for advertising traffic?"
why because only the US can be trusted with nukes? we are not the world police, stop killing our kids for others issues,
"thousands will die over there." No, if we listen to madmen like trump, and enablers like you, it will be WWIII. Where are OUR DIPLOMATS??
Only someone sic in the head thinks like Graham. like Mccain Graham is a walking cancer
I agree DJT and Graham. Really sad but all other options are useless. N.Korea never change as long as Kim Jung Un exists. Don't waste time.
There are 30,000 US troops in SK and NK can kill them all in seconds with regular artillery. F A C T. One Million S Koreans will die too!
The best military option would be to eject @LindsayGrahamSC over Pyongyang with no parachute
Is there a link to the full interview?
Sen. L Graham "troubled" about Trump obstructing Justice. But not enough 2 do anything. Yet led impeachment vs. Clinton for lying about sex
Hello, what about all those living around them, huh?
I live in South Korea. I sent my 3yo son to kindergarten in this morning. @LindseyGrahamSC jeopardizes his life with genocidally loose talk.
Hey Graham.  Shut up!  You are baiting a mad man.  He is rattling sabres, not attacking the US.
Uhh
The problem is, NK isn't on the list of regimes to overthrow. And besides, Mr Kim couldn't hit the side of a barn with his dodgy missiles. 
Graham you really believe in this miscarriage of an alternate president? Does it not hurt you to stand for that enigma and know your lying?
Sell some weapons, make some $, drop some bombs, kill a few 100k ppl, then deny refugees access to humanitarian aid. Seems legit. #Wakeup
Truly Graham is as mad as the most rabid dog. Inside his mind must be the scariest place this side of hell. We re all gonna die so feck him!
Use trade sanctions against China.  Bring them to heel!  China needs to cooperate or pay the price.
Hearing this while in Seoul. @NBCNews @MLauer @LindseyGrahamSC
You can be assured that this is the furthest thing from Trump's mind!   too busy on the golf course!
DESTROY NK ITSELF?!!? you sure about that??? you want to bet american & SK lives on that Lindsey?
Completely disagree with Sen Graham! We must explore diplomatic  channels to find a possible salutation
No, not possible, China would probably take military action against us. Our hands are tied until they attack one of our allies.

if We have to have a military response its only response , cant allow multiple strikes or rebuild
Trumps administration has gone to utter shit, they want to cause another war to make it feel like they accomplished something!! WRONG!!
Look how the GOP went to war in the Middle East and fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, now we have ISIS!
Just do what you did with Noriega.
You are out of your freaking mind!  Millions of innocent people will die because of a threat. Better talk to your God about that.  China?
It's clear this man is unhinged, a war mongering monster with no care for life on Earth. No, not North Korea's dictator, but senator Graham.
"I love the smell of radioactive fallout in the morning!  It smells like victory"???  #INSANE
Start of World War III everyone. We are approaching the end.
No surprise here. Gotta pay all those donations from Lockheed, Raytheon, and Northup Grumman back #Neocons
Wow. #asianlivesmatter. Ps. Is it ok of our 30,000 service members "die over there"?
Stupid American warmongers..
BEST PLAN:  #Amendment25NOW #PresidentMattis ... SOS !!! No more reckless cavalier talk  People's live's are at stake!!!
all you yanks are mad. NK is no #iraq #afghanistan or #libya, man! They got #nukes! #nomoreWARS


he is right here
@DNC
What about an actual diplomatic policy? Once missiles fly, thousands die. This statement sounds like it came from NK. We are better, right?
careless comment on NBC this morning shows how inept, irrational,& outright blindly dangerous & selfishly entitled your party -AND YOU- are.
dangerous ideas are born. Just like I understand your greedy party hasn't been for the people/constituents in over a decade, but your...
I understand w/a weak/compromised leader as statesman & his party capturing both houses any rationale goes out the window so very dumb and..
Did a good job, even if you didn't say what Matt wanted, thank you
so easy to go to war when you're not the one fighting.  don't think for a min. starting a war will only affect over there. not how it works
is ROK and world ready to take on the humanitarian issues the will ensue? I don't think so.
Where the feck do you Americans get these guys from? You actually elect these people?? Take a look at yourselves for goodness sake!

Did Senator Graham KNOW he was on camera and On-the-Record?  Please, Dear God, someone tell me, "No."
With this I see u r here to completely derail the agenda
He has lost his every loving mind
It would be millions dead in both South & North Korea. Possibly millions more in Japan. Nuclear war can NEVER be won by either side.
Best military option is to kick every soldier and contractor out of our tax trough. We lost the Cold War, but still pay the peace dividend.
I'd like a second opinion.
frickin brilliant. He is a verifiable source of propaganda for years. No wonder they hate us.
Now YOU are Being Batshit Crazy! 30,000,000 South Koreans are at risk!
Are you speaking on behalf of this COUNTRY or only yourself?!? Seems to me you are out of sync with other senators on this!?!? CONCERNED
NO MORE WARS
Tell China that, go on.... tell China that we're going to attack N.Korea with military might, let's see what they're response will be.
You REALLY believe Trump when he said; "If thousands die, they're going to die over there, they're not going to die here" ? SERIOUSLY?
Why are you SAYING things like this?? According to Sen. Feinstien you've had no meetings with Mattis but she has?!?? Concerning.. VERY!!
@RepBarbaraLee lee @SenateDems @timkaine her amendment to repeal aumf was deleted by Paul Ryan. We need to check this president
What kind of twisted fantasy world does Graham live in to think this way? And why is he so bloodthirsty? What's wrong with him?
@LindseyGrahamSC your stated today if thousands die then it's going to be over in  U do realize 2800 of  troops R in that region NO WAR
Urging war in Korea (N & S) is cold-blooded butchery unparalleled since Stalin. Talk to Sen.Diane Feinstein. Even North wants Peace Treaty.
@LindseyGrahamSC your stated today if thousands die then it's going to be over in  U do realize 2800 of  troops R in that region NO WAR
Ms Graham is one sick MF who still thinks we living in 1950. She needs to change her diapers
why is this war nut even given a chance to speak in public?  he embarrasses America
Wth???
Literally almost every reply to this is a hippy liberal, bomb the norks already
Lindsey graham is ridiculous and dangerous. Can't trust him.
Well Senator, the fact that you have confidence in Trump on this matter is very disturbing and to be quite honest it's irresponsible.
unless China is no longer the protector, I see this as a pipe dream
Continuing Dimplomacy after 25 years is kicking-can-down-road until horric event of Japan or US getting hit with Nuke tip ICBM from N. Korea
A question. NK does work on getting ICBMs and sufficient nuclear arms capability, true. But why would they ever use it to attack someone?
This is why everyone hates Americans.
That statement entirely justifies their development of ICBM.
IF MILITARY ACTION IS REQUIRED, Y'ALL NEED TO HURRY UP AND IMPEACH ALREADY. ****NO**** WAR AUTHORIZATION FOR THIS "PRESIDENT." NO WAY!!
Yeah, because there's not millions of innocent people being held hostage. Let's just bomb them! Seems like the only idea repubs can thing of
IN U.S. AND ABROAD, THIS "PRESIDENT" DOES ****NOT**** HAVE SUFFICIENT CREDIBILITY FOR SUCH ACTION.
THERE WILL BE ****NO**** WAR UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THIS "PRESIDENT." ZERO. THERE IS NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH TRUST IN DT FOR MILITARY ACTION.
