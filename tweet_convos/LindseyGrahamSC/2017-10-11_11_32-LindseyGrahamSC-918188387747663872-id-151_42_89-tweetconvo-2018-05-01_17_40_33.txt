The tens of millions of taxpayer money spent letting Trump golf are paying off. Of course it's also demonstration of more Trump lies.
I believe he shot a 73 because he can only count to 4.
@G8RPaul look at the photo, hitting a 3 wood out of swale grass? I think not
"Another perfect shot, sir" - Lindsey "Sen. Smithers" Graham
Of course-he has spent 35% of his presidency golfing instead of addressing important issues-we need help GOP-what’s it going to take?
Actually the positions look pretty good. If he can putt he might have done it.
Hilarious the criticism Trump is getting for a round of golf. Obama played more than any pres ever! Did you criticize him.....doubtful
REALLY?  You and Dictator Donnie are playing golf.  Isn’t that nice. Many Americans are now wondering how they will live-literally w/o HC..
Really, you by this crap? No wonder your magazine is failing.
Haha in me fooking hoop did he shoot 73?!  
@Blurns @amcclure147 @keithcairns @alanmetcalfe
Well if you don't count the many Mulligans, the 3 feet gimmees or the preferred lies he takes in the deep rough to about 10 feet .....
And now you've lost your integrity. Good grief; do you people have any self respect? Trump shot a 73 in wet and windy conditions - right -
So this picture looks like he skulled it coming out of the weeds. Worm burner! I'm sure it checked up to 2ft. #birdie #madness  #Liar #MAGA
Reminder: You're NOT allowed to delete ANY of this! So how's that @realDonaldTrump thing working out for you?! 
If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed.......and we will deserve it.
@realDonaldTrump is a 70+ yr. old fat and out of shape old man. Their is no F*^>~ way he shot a 73 in "Wet/Windy" conditions. #Liars
@LindseyGrahamSC have you reached the #trump #taint yet? Tastes good?
@realDonaldTrump cheats. Why do you lie for him senator Graham?
I think you’ve mistakenly put a picture up of John Daly.
I believe it. He's had plenty of practice fully funded from my taxes
@spencer_cooper
I can tell you all about the time I [didnt] shoot a 68 on Pebble when you have 30 minutes for a phone call, too. 
Hahaha nice
@LindseyGrahamSC I hear the Dear Leader can bowl a perfect 300, though he chooses not to. Game for losers! He doesn't poop either.
@LindseyGrahamSC was planning to tell the world Trump bowled a 301 tomorrow
...but you go ahead and play. 

DISGUSTING

UNACCEPTABLE

DO YOUR JOB
You need to go on #morningjoe to state Trump cheats. @JoeNBC @WillieGeist @morningmika
Don't you think it's hypocritical how much vacation and golf weekends he's taken, given how he complained about Obama's 8 times he golfed.
If #orangegutan can hit 73 then I’m hitting five under par at every golf course i go to. Bullshit
@LindseyGrahamSC is a honest man all his life. He traded all that for a lie for Trump's golf score. Sad!
Secret Service Services his Balls
Big deal, Kim Jung Il shot a 38 under par 34. Our despot has never even been close to that.
That's why Trump practice every weekend to beat that score. I bet @LindseyGrahamSC will tell us Trump shot a 33 soon. Right Lindsey?
@LindseyGrahamSC our God Emperor is best! #1! He will shoot down the nukes with golfballs! How blessed we are to have him in charge of media
As announced by North Korea's Revered Anchor!! 
While people are dying...in Puerto Rico....and California these losers are playing golf
https://www.thestar.com/sports/golf/2011/12/19/kim_jongil_once_carded_38under_par_at_pyongyang_golf_course.html … got a long ways to go Trump. Lets see that 39 under!
Improbable, you say?
Trump is known to pick up/replace balls, and other cheats. And it fits with his whole life philosophy of being a liar
Wish the prez would work on helping disaster victims as much as he does golf
Will Senator Graham discuss how this little odyssey was a bribe?
@LindseyGrahamSC

Only @realDonaldTrump would use a wood in that 
Ty lindsey graham for wasting tax payers money in order to kiss the fat ass failure of an attempted potus. What a joke.
No one cares @LindseyGrahamSC. We r a little preoccupied with fact that we have a souless, mentally unstable monster in the WH. #MoronDon
It amazes me how much he is like the Kim Jon family. Next he's going to say he invented the hamburger
Surely there are more important things happening in Golf.
Well, we all have to do disgusting things sometimes.

@mikebacon13 @Bryce_Rieckers
Improbable is far too soft of a word. Impossible. Like him turning over his tax returns, being honest with the citizens or doing his job.
BULLSHIT
And using a five plus year old driver.
Check Senator McCain he purchased information from former MI6 spy that Putin's Russia spies got from informants. Mueller and Comey informed.

For someone over 70 creating that extension, rotation and hip turn @realDonaldTrump no fake news there !!
@LindseyGrahamSC 73! You Lie!
You are going to believe lying Graham
"@trump on the front 9, hit 7 greens in regulation and made four 10-12' putts for par." Those first putts must have been horrible!
WGAF!
If he's hitting driver from the rough, no way he shot 73.
If Trump shot a 73, it must have been on the outward 9.
@realDonaldTrump please tell me this is #fakenews Meanwhile #PuertoRicoRelief #Vegas #CAfires #stopgolfing #giveyourtimetovictims @Bethenny
Yer he only played 9 #golf #TrumpLies
Looks like he's a better golfer than a president.
And Kim shot 11 hole in ones.
Who cares? Fake score!
Wait, Senator Graham...What’s that loud sucking sound? Oh. It’s you trying to remove your lips from Trump’s saggy lying white butt.
Who gives a s____
That peice of shit is weak , I'll dog em and I've never golfed
Why is it improbable? Poor choice of words! How about "great round Mr. President"! He's a super golfer after all!
Did you spend a minute discussing these heros?   Perhaps at the turn?  Anything?
how trump gets his 73...
The Secret Service are quick on their feet, if you know what I mean (nudge, nudge; wink, wink).
So glad he found time for a fun round with Lindsey Graham.   Nothing else important to do on that day, so thinks Donald.
What the hell is wrong with you? This guy is a clear and present danger and you tweet this drivel??
Wonder what he had on the back 9!
Haha! Nice
Really?  Meaning Trump would have averaged about 4 strokes a hole, or 2 over par? bu**s*it
HE CHEATS...EVERYONE KNOW IT
@realDonaldTrump lies about his scores like he lies about absolutely everything else. The "man" is incapable of telling the truth.
Looks to be hitting an R1
Wow. YOU ARE A CUNT
The Donald getting sharp for a match up with the Korean leader!
Happy #NationalComingOutDay @LindseyGrahamSC YOU CAN BE GAY, REPUBLICAN, AND PROUD! Add your voice, sir!
What’s wrong with you ? Californians and Puerto Rican’s are dying and you are bragging about Trump’s golf game! Deplorable!!!
Meh!  I shoot 73 EVERY time I golf.... by about #13
When you own the course and are POTUS, people around you look the other way when u double bogey
If you are giving putts score doesn't count
He missd! The ball is still in the 3-feet rough..!!HA HA.....
Senator Graham we are going to bury you with this. You’ll never be re-elected due to this very issue you chose at this time in history. Done
Respectfully, this is complete and utter bullshit.  A 74, from 6,800, while driving 250 (more bs!) is impossible!  You defile the game! 
@LindseyGrahamSC will you have to do a follow up like this? https://www.google.com/amp/amp.timeinc.net/golf/tour-and-news/kim-jong-ils-record-setting-round-may-not-have-been-all-it-was-cracked-be%3Fsource=dam … I see no difference XD
A Fail on the Smell Test.
Look at old fat-ass trying to spend U.S. dollars for his pleasure!
Y’all a bunch of haters bc he’s better than you 
bcs its not like Calif is burning,  PR is drowning or russian sanctions havent been imposed despite 98-2 vote.
Let them eat gold balls.
@LindseyGrahamSC do you even remember the us? You know it's that country you work for and are sworn to protect?
@LindseyGrahamSC do you know how sad and pathetic you look right now? As well as psychopathic given everything going on in the US?
Is "improbable" the new "fake"? Did @realDonaldTrump also invent "improbable"?
@LindseyGrahamSC now I know what he means by the 1thing  understands - ! The Kims make their lackeys exaggerate their game too!
@realDonaldTrump
Can you believe that,with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf.Worse than Carter
Not a patch on Kim Jong Il record of a 34 with at least 5 hole in ones!
Just give the man credit you weirdo libs. It is seriously pathological with you people
He’s the best golfer who ever played the game. Nobody is a better golfer. WTF.   Meanwhile, in Puerto Rico....
Um...Puerto Rico?
Trump has a terrible swing and anyone that plays golf knows he is a duffer not a real golfer
The important question is how much did that game of golf cost us, the taxpayers?

I shoot 73 every week, sometimes even lower.... 15foot is a gimme, free drop out of trees or bushes, and 2nd chip or pitch is allowed...
He is an asswipe
"Improbable" sounds about right
You are full of BS Lindsey! @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @GenJohnKelly @Secy_State_US @GOP #MAGA @KellyannePolls @PressSec
Maybe with his fake handicap.
I have it on good authority, TaylorMade are the best. A good gift for a POTUS.

If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed.......and we will deserve it.
With all the serious issues facing this country and the world and YOU dwell on this nonsensical story. The World is Going Crazy!
Can anyone tell me why he’s hitting a driver in knee high grass
Trump is a hack...the gimme puts prove it.
@SInow how many mulligans and foot wedges though?
Wonder how much you commented on Obama’s game?  Can you just let him be?  This is getting old.
How many Mulligans did he take? 

Steph better
Only way he shoots 73, is if he quits after 14 holes
Trump used the "Kim Jong-Il tees" at the edge of the greens.
The key to a great golf game is to prioritize the game above sending aid to Puerto Rico and trying to provoke foreign leaders into starting a nuclear war with us.
u
Number of “gimme’s”, “pick-it-up”, “that’s good” and “sure, take the drop”=17!!
21 Americans died in Cali fires & PR AMERICANS  still have no water& Nazis R marching the streets , but oh well, Glad y'all had fun!
Nazis aren’t marching in the streets moron. Fat white nerds with posters aren’t Nazis.
#SoJuicy #CantUnsee #LeaveThePeoplesHouse #Moron
Senator Graham SHOULD BE speaking to FEMA boss to find out why he thinks FEMA isn't responsible for delivering supplies, food & water to PR.
Say something nice! Or I'm gonna have tantrum
Ok. You are a beautiful woman. How's that?
Lose weight bro
Change your pants smh.
...and your ‘tennis’ shorts, too. 
73??? He's still rocking pleated pants #comeonman
Now that's fake news...
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/08/17/deepening-gop-split-trump-attacks-republican-senators-graham-flake-as-publicity-seeking-toxic/ …  someone is try to get in liar liars good books
Not a fucking chance
I'd sooner believe that Kim Jong-Il shot -38 than Donald Trump shot a 73.
He spends a lot of time golfing, which helps.
