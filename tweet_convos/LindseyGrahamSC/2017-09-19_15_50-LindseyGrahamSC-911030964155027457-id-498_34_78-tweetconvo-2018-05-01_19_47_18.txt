Like that is a good thing?  Wisconsin is trying to kill everything good except for corporations. Are you nuts?
Please listen to the calls coming from Wisconsin asking you to #VoteNo and #SavetheACA
GOP states w already shitty healthcare ratings,which refused Medicare Expansion out of spite will get $$ frm states treating residents well.
In order to pass the buck, and let states gut medicaid, elder care, and pre-existing/benefit caps for millions.
Given your poor opinion of Washington, why are you still there?
And causes premiums to go up so much it will make the ACA look like a gift
Where WI is already trying to privatize long term health care. Just remember those with special needs children when you look at his face.
The states don't seem to keen on #GrahamCassidyBill
BREAKING: The bipartisan Medicaid Directors from all 50 states just issued this negative statement about Graham-Cassidy.…
How many constituent calls have you received in support v. against? Do you even care about constituents?
No, it's putting it into the hands of @SecPriceMD to decide if state proposal okay. Still under federal rule, just not fairly.
By using the power of Washington to oppress certain states for not voting for you. Yeah...
But the state has to build the infrastructure to run it. Medicaid isn’t great or efficient currently. Very bad plan
Empowers them to remove protections for preexisting conditions, allow lifetime caps, & stop coverage for pregnancy and newborns. #prodeath
Thank goodness for Tammy. She has some compassion and sense.
You did this already doesn't work or do you want to punish the poor?
Vote No! WI does not want the Graham-Cassidy bill! 
@SenRonJohnson 
#ShameOnYouRonJohnson
#VoteNOGrahamCassidy
The bill is a nightmare that will hurt your constituents and set the nation back.
Lazyasses can't come up with healthcare,deport illegals the only gov. does is line their pockets and fuck everyone else.
You're a LIAR AND A POS, and so is Walker!!!
So how's this working out for you and your posse Ronnie?
LIAR. Millions lose cover & costs skyrocket for everyone else. Ends Medicare. Disabled,seniors,women,vets lose cover.
#ACA, better than DEAD
You wish
Then quit your sweet federal job.....

Wisconsin loses $2 billion. How do mansplane that??
Pre-existing condition? Read this
Yes, especially WI and AK. We're not fools. We've read that part. #WorstBillYet #RegularOrder #RsAndDsWorkTogether
WOW ! The medical industry will need to hire more lobbyists  to cover each state and not just Washington DC !!
We need uniform healthcare access, not 50 different plans. The healthcare system is overly complex enough.
You mean it takes the money and runs. You mean it takes the money out of the pockets of individuals and returns it to corporate healthcare.
No Absolutely Not To Your Disgusting Tax Money Windfall for the Rich TrumpCare Bill.  ScumBag Bribe Sucking Leeches - No To #GrahamCassidy
And it’s time for the American people to take back their government. #standwithkimmel
Defund All Obamacare

Is Washington that incompetant? - maybe we should remove all the power from you guys!!!!Medicare seems to work ok.
I loved your call in town halls. Grow a pair.
Health care is about people, not power, Senator.

BREAKING: The bipartisan Medicaid Directors from all 50 states just issued this negative statement about Graham-Cassidy.…
Under partisan politics - State Government worse - no oversight, no safe guards like Obamacare
Senator Johnson lied vociferously on " Morning Joe" and should be ashamed of himself. So should you, Senator Graham.
We want a CBO score before vote
BULLSHIT!! IT TAKES HEALTHCARE FROM PEOPLE. WOULD THE GOP STOP LYING.
This bill takes healthcare away from Americans and gives tax cuts to rich people.
Really ?
I thought the government should be out of health care?
The Koch Brother plan puts 400 million in the GOP bank account fpr your reelection campaigns No more than GOP greed
Damn right
Illinois went 2 years w/out a budget. How do you think they will legislate healthcare? States don't have $$ so will all ask for waivers
You are assuming the states have all the tools to enact this.  It is a nightmare.
States are too busy trying to feed people and deal with infastructure, they can't deal with healthcare block grants. This is stupid.
@LindseyGrahamSC @NewDay another old wealthy politician that doesn't give a shit about Americans. FRAUD.
@LindseyGrahamSC @NewDay @YouTube Really a GOP  sham. My healthcare under ACA is planned as always by my Dr. and me. Not DC.
Vote No from South Carolina!
American Medical Association as does our state's only insurance provider BC/BS oppose this plan.
Remove all federal money, then get back to me.
U guys r pathetic. U just don't care that many Americans will lose coverage, as long as u repeal Ocare.
Give up your insurance first.. then we'll talk.
So States can deny access to healthcare for millions.  Just DC Republicans #PassingTheBuck to State-level Republicans.  #VoteNOonGC
Yeah, the power to screw people over who have a PEC.
Nonsense. The bill is not good for America. Is made up of lies that will hurt American people. No CBO,NO DEBATE. Done in the dark
It's a mean horrible bill and you know it.
That's a load of malarkey! Your anger with the reporter asking @ pre-existing conditions was SAD BIGGLY!  
NO Repeal #ACA
No-it just takes healthcare from millions while giving your big $$$ donors a tax break! You're all liars!
Bill crap. You all are fake news.
Gives it to states to screw up! Thanks for not having a CLUE what to do--you should all be impeached!
Liars. #GrahamCassidy
Avalere, a consulting firm, modeled Graham-Cassidy's cap on Medicaid over time. Look what it does to children and the disabled. SAVAGE. 
here is a novel idea, instead of giving your primiums to company or gov how abot we get to keep it and save it for our use for care?
WI does not support this bill! Insurance is supposed to be a safety net not a punishment on sick. When will you understand? Fight for PEOPLE

You must think we're dam fools. Your only concern is tax breaks for your wealthy donors PERIOD! Just stop making yourself look crazier.
We All Understand  ... Jimmy Kimmel is Right  ... You're WRONG !! All Major medical groups TOTALLY disagree with #GrahamCassidy #NoTrumpCare
No no no! WTF is wrong with you?
When your state is broke and turns to the federal government for age don't expect it
Stop assuming, all people are as simple as Trump supporters. 
You know that TrumpCare is going to kill people. Stop lying.
Whiteness in power is willing to kill Americans at any cost it's purely a cult with these Republicans.
It's all about appealing Obamacare they can't stand that a black man has a bill that may remain law.
Why does people vote for people like him he's clearly does not have the best interest of the American people.
It is clear that these Republicans will continue to vote on a death wish plan no matter what it does.
Will you help your plan be affordable for people does who are covered by Obamacare, now no guarantee.
Will the cost covered preconditions according to him no guarantee.
Ron Johnson is full of bluster and bullshit. He can't answer a simple question about the healthcare bill he's supporting.
 #LIAR  Saw You on @Morning_Joe this morning #TalkingOverPeople #Pontificating & #RefusingToAnswerQuestions  #TheResistance U R A 
Why can't you sell the features of your bill? All you do is trash Ocare. Everyone already understands the issues w/Ocare. How does this fix?
7 years of claiming you have an answer to the ACA and now you cant give one fact or figure about the bill your co-sponsoring
Fraud. More lies. No answers. What a robotic shill of the GOP. Trumpcare is Deathcare. Sad clown this morning on Morning Joe. Can't answer
Where the GOP has a lock on more legislature? We see through your B.S.
I have surgery next week to remove carcinoma. How will you guarantee my premiums won't skyrocket as I become a pre-existing condition?
Why do I have to beg you every few months to NOT take healthcare away from my kids & me?!
Your arguments are very SAD, Ron.
What doctors and medical organizations have you talked to for support?  I've asked your office: No reply.
Who cares if it denies preexisting?
Ohhh that's how u justify 4 supporting this DISGRACEFUL Bill? If U like ur job I'd think twice as I've been reading ur constituents tweets
This will hurt so many people. Vote no. Giving the states more power isn't a good thing considering this state's leadership.
The power is with the Insurance Companies, who you are in bed with. Do the right thing for your constituents: Kill the #GrahamCassidyBill
Also punishes states that expanded Medicaid under ACA and rewards those that did not ? Why no basis other than giving $$ to red states
Look at these comments. Why are you ignoring your constituents?
No, it kills people.

States rights defended slavery, jim crow, segregation and now denial of medical care to tens of millions, Senator. Thanks a bunch, no thanks
And it takes away healthcare for millions! Stop lying to your constituents !
Shame on you.
I see urging you to vote no and stand by your constituents is a waste of time. People over party. Time to go Ron. Let's vote him out
Stop lying to us!
.....Healthcare should be decided by the UNITED STATES AKA THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT!!!!
.....established, TO ENSURE ALL AMERICAN CITIZENS ARE CARED FOR EQUALLY!!!! Healthcare shouldn't be decided by the States.....
Liar.
They get a disproportionate share because the other states TURNED DOWN THE SAME FREE MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 

I'm losing my mind https://twitter.com/jim_newell/status/910212007143583744 …
You are so wrong! Face it, the Koch Brothers aren't  finacing any Republicans until you get rid of the ACA #Obamacare #GrahamCassidyBill
.....and try to better it by providing millions of more Americans with access to healthcare! There's a reason a federal government was.....
...to that State run disaster? Wow, how forward thinking! How dare Pres Obama take the worst healthcare system of all developed Countries...
"Back to regular order!" Sen John McCain
Your support of this dismantling of ACA is irresponsible & disgusting. You are evidently suckling at the teat of corruption. #VoteHimOut2018
Unfortunately he's not up for reelection in '18.
Darn. Well we can definitely make what time he has left in office as miserable as possible.
.....with the status quo. A status quo that was criminal, corrupt, inhumane and run by the States! Your "BRILLIANT IDEA" is going back.....
Your bigotry is showing sir. You are unable to support your bill WITHOUT invoking the scary black man who brought healthcare to Americans
.....you trust the Insurance Companies will do what's right for their customers. You are so full of it! Republicans were just fine......
Liar
.....to the States but don't worry, you trust they'll do what's right! Let me guess, you trust the Insurance Companies. Let me guess....
I love how you said that you trust the States to do what's right, WHAT???? Healthcare has been a COMPLETE DEBACLE FOR DECADES when left.....
..... Americans know that your STUPID IDEA of just letting the States deal with their own healthcare DOESN'T F#CKING WORK!
Your Yes vote will Repeal and Replace. YOU! GOP has turned into a JOKE want to R.& Replace something. He sits in the oval office start there
60% of Americans say it's the Federal Government's responsibility to make sure ALL AMERICANS have healthcare coverage! That's because.....
.....AMONG THE WORST! Thankfully someone was looking out for the well being of the American people. Republicans sure don't give a SH#T!
What planet did you live on before the ACA was implemented? Your Country's healthcare system compared to other developed Countries.....
HA, he called it "health care".... 
#SaveACA
@GOP = #GreedyAF
Hope you've enjoyed your temp job. You will be voted out.
#YouCantEscapeKarma
If this bill becomes law, you and all who vote for it will be responsible 4 Americans DYING!!! You will be GUILTY! Shame on you! #Obamacare
It also takes millions out of having insurance. You don’t fool anyone.
You are incredibly delusional. Stop lying to the American people.Those with pre existing conditions will be left without affordable coverage
You're HILARIOUS!!!! Why do you think Pres Obama worked so hard to pass the ACA......BECAUSE THE STATES DID A SHIT JOB PROVIDING HEALTHCARE!
Enough with Republican talking points(aka:lies) You pass this and you're paying for tax cuts for the rich with the blood of the sick & poor.
Fulfilling a promise based on lies is criminal. Fix what we have & educate yourself on single payer, it's what America wants & deserves.
Wait! The states who didn't expand Medicaid are the ones who don't care about the people in their state.
Irresponsible states decided their ideology was more important than their health of their citizens.
Healthcare is a right not a privilege for the wealthy.  Responsible states cared enough about their people to expand Medicaid.
Like @RepTomPrice taking that private jet out of Washington and landing in a few states? Dr. P needed to reassure donors/Ins. Co. Executives
Health care for the people should not be tied to tax cuts for the rich.  
Medicaid
Talking fast, and talking over Chuck Todd, does not make what you say true. We are smarter than that. I agree with Jimmy Kimmel
This bill is horrible, history will not be kind to you once insurance is stripped away from millions.
AND THE SMUG AH FILIBUSTERED THE HOST AND ANSWERED NONE OF THE QUESTIONS.  HE REMINDED ME OF A OLD SOUTH ARROGANT REACTIONARY!
U REPUBS KISS THEIR ASSES!  SHAME ON U! U & UR ILK ARE THE GOONS, PAWNS, PUPPETS OF THE CORPORATISTS, PLUTOCRATS, KLEPTOCRATS & OLIGARCHS.
U.S. MANUFACTURERS/CORPORATIONS WANT TO PAY WORKERS LESS, GIVE THEM FEWER OR NO BENEFITS, WANT TO POLLUTE MORE AND PAY NO TAXES.
TAXES ARE NOT THE REAL ISSUE RE COMPETITION. LIVING WAGES, BENEFITS, WORKPLACE SAFETY, CORPORATE GOOD CITIZENSHIP ARE THE ISSUES.

We don't have any money for healthcare for Americans, BUT there's tons of money to cut taxes for RICH & CORPORATIONS!  YOU LIE!!
U.S. BUSINESS IS COMPETING NICELY WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD WITH THE BSNS TAXES THEY ACTUALLY PAY AS OPPOSED TO THE "RATE" THEY DON'T PAY!
States shouldn't decide what #healthcare I get in one state, & what my brother gets in another.  ALL s/get SAME COVERAGE. #WednesdayWisdom

Kimmel, not Cassidy, is right on health care, analysts say http://politi.co/2ydCLI9 
IOW, I DON'T NEED A TAX CUT. NEITHER DO YOU OR ANY OF THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS OR THE KOCH'S OR OTHER ROBBER BARONS OF AMERICAN BUSINESS!
IF YOU OBTUSE REPUBLICANS WOULD LEAVE MY TAX RATE ALONE & MAYBE EVEN INCREASE IT, THE U.S. COULD COME CLOSE TO PAYING ITS BILLS!
Let's see what the CBO review indicates so we can make an informed decision. Also, too many benevolent organizations oppose this bill.
States choose NOT cover pre-existing conditions,right @SenRobJohnson? Where I live determines what coverage I get? Kill #GrahamCassidy
This new health care bill will kill my brother and steal my sons future.
You are a lie. In every state that worked with the ACA costs went down and coverage went up. Our nation is endangered by ties toChairman
HORRIBLE interview on MTP Daily. Shame on you. You can't justify or defend this, so you deflect to OCare. Try 2 answer questions next time.
Republicans screamed about our 20TRILLION debt for the past 8yrs & suddenly it's ok to raise it for tax cuts for rich

Bet you think the wall is fiscally sound, right? 13 percent of Americans support your plan. That is voting against your constituents.
Evil. Liar. Wisconsin deserves better.
Trading healthcare for tax cuts. As long as you get yours, right?
IF YOU WANT THE OLD, POOR, SICK & HELPLESS KIDS TO BE KICKED, KEEP KISSING SOUTHERN REPUBLICAN'S ASSES. THE SOUTH IS A BAD PLACE TO BE POOR!
"States Rights"

Oh, you mean racism!
I'd love to share my thoughts with you, but your DC mailbox is full. Answer your calls, hold town halls, and do your job. #GrahamCasiddy
to hurt the voters of participating states. You are a corrupt individual. Find a new job Ron
states whose Republican Governors & representatives chose not to participate in & hurt their voters. Now they want
If yr so worried about the Trillion $ deficit, how about starting w/cutting back on your presidents golf outings & Treasury Dept spending!
SOUTHERN STATES ARE BAD PLACES TO BE POOR, LEFT BEHIND & LEFT OUT! TAKE AN HOUR & STUDY SOUTHERN SOCIOLOGY. IT'LL SOON BE WI'S SOCIOLOGY!
You're talking about being a fiscally conservative Senator who would easily vote for billions to build a wall #hypocrite
for the wealthiest Americans. Stealing the money from the poor in states that expanded Medicaid as directed to the
Trying to sell this horrendous healthcare plan exposes your corruption for all to see. Worse TRUMPCARE for tax cuts
SINCE WISCONSIN HAS JOINED THE OLD CONFEDERACY IN ITS GOVERNANCE, YOUR CITIZENS WILL SUFFER THE SAME FATE AS OLD & POOR SOUTHERNERS.
Hey Lyin Ron Johnson. We're 20TRILLION in debt & YOU want to give the wealthiest Americans & corps tax cuts. U FRAUD
Does this lying Senator understand that he is part of Washington? No more excuses for a dysfunctional political party.
Liar
No, of course it doesn't. You know this. Shame on you. You probably call yourself a "Christian" too. For shame.
GOP healthcare assault is criminal http://neglect.You  are the scum of the swamp.
Wow every single comment is negative vote yes and prepare to be voted out
Under #GrahamCassidy, pregnancy could cost you an extra $17,320. Breast cancer would cost $28,660. http://ampr.gs/2fhTLcH  #ProtectOurCare
I have learned that every time a Senator says it puts States in control it means we are all screwed except the senators which will continue
To have theirs paid for by those of us who are no longer able to afford it ourselves.
Washington is the federal government we are the United States of America not the divided States of America
Just watched u do double speak on MSNBC,i didn't hear u say emphatically that pre existing are covered.all I keep saying was better than aca
Just a BS line you repeat over and over to brainwash People
