In the meantime, are you going to let Draft Dodger "I support veterans" Trump screw over Vietnam Vet's IU benefits?
My brother was killed in Viet Nam and I miss him every day of my life. Never forgive him for what he said ab Sen Mccain
My uncle died from Agent Orange exposure. Stepfather stands to lose unemployability benefits as disabled vet.
So sorry to hear about ur Uncle my brother died loving what he did. was 101st Airborne - Paratrooper I miss him so much
U should of seen my Moms face when he told her he was joining the Army to Be a Paratrooper .
Look what you're allowing. It's party over country, evidently. The GOP survived Watergate. It won't survive this.

Do you Favor the Rich.....Americans think you do
Need Legislation to stop visas to Russians Trump has allowed 150 known Russian spies in to committ espionage Actions speak louder than words
Are you going to stop this to prove you support Vietnam and disabled veterans?
Why was the Cheetoh-in-Chief on the golf course? Insult to our troops-damn draft dodger. He has to go b4 this country is destroyed.
When it comes to treason, yr either for or against. Are you willing to fully oppose Donald Trump- or do you forsake every American value?
At least there are some patriots left in the USA!  You, the president and the GOP are destroying what those people are fighting for!

Trump is a disgrace to our men and women in service! Why aren't republicans taking action on traitors in the White House?
What are you going to do now that Trump picked Russia Over America is the GOP going to put country over party now
You are a traitor to your country if you don't speak out & put a stop to Trump's treasonous behavior with Putin!
"These are the ones who insulted you?" Putin to Trump as he points to reporters https://twitter.com/dimsmirnov175/status/883370772865134593 â€¦
Graham stay home and get behind Trumps policies.  We can't afford your trips.
Really? Not on a Trump golf course somewhere? @POTUS
You think they are risking their lives so you can sit back & watch @POTUS joke about press with Putin? THAT is what they are protecting!
This senate healthcare bill needs to go in the garbage. We were promised #FullRepeal! Please don't let us down!
#UnitedForFreedom
Why are you people letting this man and his Cult destroy our country?
#FullRepeal! Say NO 2 Universal HC! USA is 2 big 4 social. med. 4 all. Stand #UnitedForFreedom! Help Vets. Let them choose own docs & hosps.

Malware found in power company networks seems to have been trying to map out the systems. 
Meanwhile .. @GOP can't keep ignoring this

"armed forces" to wrap yourself in.

Any town halls planned for the Lowcountry?
God Bless You Sen Graham .The troops know who cares about them. God Bless the Troops I pray every night to kp them safe.
U r the best Sen right up with my hero Sen McCain . Thanks for all I do
Do YOUR part 2 protect America! Don't let the fraud lift sanctions, allowing putin 2 establish USA foreign policy. Get your  TF together!
You don't belong with those brave men & women. You and your buddy McShame are traitors & Never Trumpers. Disgraceful!
Interesting that @npr tweeted the #DeclarationOfIndependence and Prople thought it was about Trump
You enjoy strategy session with Liz and McCain?
This is independence day not some authoritarian ode to military force.
Bring them home now!
What's up with the GOP this week!!

How about some childish tweets from prez, or new plans on screwing people our healthcare!!
Don't send them into yet another war.
Great job Mr. Graham!!! Now come on back to SC safe!!
Senator, good to see you visit South Waziristan in Pakistan to see things first hand. Good leadership!
you should protect it too. Quit protecting this president
Bravo! You add strength to our nation
Words without action useless-what are you going to do about the lies and hate coming from the White House? @realDonaldTrump @VP
Rhino says what? #rhinosayswhat
Thank you senators/congressional delegation  for visiting and caring about our military men and women.
This is what Potus tweeted.  Is this American diplomacy at its finest? Not normal!
North Korea has just launched another missile. Does this guy have anything better to do with his life? Hard to believe that South Korea.....
Too bad your Republican president could not be bothered visiting troops on July 4. busy flying between his golf courses at taxpayer expense.
You could serve them back by removing Trump from office. I hear he's a Con Man. Sound about right.
That's amazing!  So great of you to visit them.  U.S. Armed Forces are real life superheroes!!!

Brilliant...
Thank you Linds for yours 
I too am in the company of those who we're in the armed forces as respected physicians, & who question the wisdom of our current leadership
Maybe a wife
Why don't you have a wife Mr Christian????
You are a great representative of the people of the United States. As a New Yorker, I appreciate your dedication.
You could be with all of your elite friends.
Thx Senator Graham. As an independent that leans left I'm hoping you help us reuinite. Happy 4th, sir!
Pretty much sums it up about rhino @LindseyGrahamSC
Please don't waste their sacrifice.Protect our democracy from our anti-free press, anti-independent judiciary, Russia loving President.
They protect us everyday make sure when they come home we do the same for them
then why would you help put a deranged Russian-loving, sociopath in charge of them?
While you support a King George III wannabe in the White House.
Smile as you look them in the eye and know you're going to screw them out of Medicare and health insurance  :)
To honor them properly, pls consider your stance on healthcare, voter suppression and North Korea. They fight for our freedoms, will you?
We all know it's not in the "better company of a woman".
Hey mister sister. Thank goodness you don't have to worry about DADT anymore!! #closetrepub #beproud #gaysenatorsunite

And ur pres is golfing again at one of his properties.
Senator Graham appreciate you for always supporting the troops. Prayers for safe travels for our troops and for you coming home.
IMPEACH HIM NOW
Amen and God Bless America!
Better company: #25thAmendmentNow #25thAmendment #25thAmendmentNOW
Service personnel now have the additional burden of protecting these political parasites instead of enjoying a few hours downtime..
Thank you for supporting our Troops! You strengthen their resolve with your strong  support and presence! #LetFreedomRing #GodBlessTheUSA
Thanks Sen Graham!  Happy 4th.
If you are a true patriot, then it's time to act and  put your money where your mouth is
Better get 'em fired to up to fight in Korea due to Tangerine Mussolini's incompetence.
You are right, great company.  Thank you for your service too Senator  from a Dem who appreciates your service.  Safe travels.  Happy 4th.
Nice to see the bipartisan group there.
While your doing this #POTUS  is golfing.  AGAIN!!
Also no special plans for Congress and Senate, you guys must have the same healthcare as the rest of us! #AMERICAFIRST 
#BUILDTHEWALL
Hope you're proud of your king and dear leader that you and your hopeless cronies support
Have you promised our armed forces you will protect their healthcare? You certainly aren't doing a good job of protecting ours.
Trump's proposed budget cuts rehabilitation & community health for veterans and the Armed Forces Retirement Home.   #25AmendmentNow
Pass reasonable health care bill that does not exclude people with pre-existing conditions, no lifetime $ limits, & no cuts to seniors plans
@USFOR_A is now saying Assad has chemical weapons #israel fool me once shame on u fool me twice pay congress
how about you honor YOUR oath to defend our nation against ALL enemies, foreign/domestic? One sits in the White House when he's not golfing.
@USFOR_A dont worry oir ally that told us Iraq had WMDs
Do they know that you're getting ready to strip them of quality of care so that your rich backers get a fat tax cut? Just wondering.
Ask them if their friends and family members are low and middle income and how they feel about GOP pricing them out of healthcare?
@USFOR_A its nice isn't it not having to serve and sending others ppls kids to war so u can get paid.
Now there's a presidential style Tweet and I'm not even Republican
While the orange turd is golfing.
we may not agree on all issues but please do not let Trump continue to taint the GOP, destroy democracy and show loyalty to Putin
Well said. These 'Trump or die' morons who would let him get away with whatever are scaring me. I'm all for responsible & centrist legislati
Nice bipartisan trip to thank the troops!
I hope when they get home you'll make sure they have healthcare
Senator, we are counting on you to step up and uphold our nation against threats both foreign and domestic.
Thank you for your service and happy 4th.
