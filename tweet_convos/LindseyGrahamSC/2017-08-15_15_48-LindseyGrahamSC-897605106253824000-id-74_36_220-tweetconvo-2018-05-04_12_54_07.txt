Spoke with the media earlier today in Columbia about #charlottesville and steps forward.

Yeah so how did that work out.
Hahahaha that is funny.  He is a racist egomaniac that just can't help himself.  Reminds me of that old crazy drunk uncle.
Ed, your a part of the POS gang.
Ok bot.
Senator "hopes" Trump admin comes down like a hammer. Hope is gone. After today he is their sympathizer. Get djt out of our house now!
This is an opportunity for Swampy to SHUT-UP, get OFF CNN and support our President. Swampy has all negative comments ab/him on Facebook.
How about coming down on all groups/people who inflict bodily harm on others? Antifa and BLM were players in this tragedy.
WHAT ABOUT BLM &ANTIFA.THE LEFT HATE GROUPS NEED TO FACE CHARGES ALSO.THEY SHOT COPS&STEVE SCALISE.
Trump has no moral authority! His vile outlook is a veritable cancer on our society. One hopes he soon will have no authority of any kind.
Thank you for saying what our President should have!
Must. Be. Joking.
Apparently, Pres doesn't speak hammer and U don't speak English!  He has repeatedly denounced White Supremacists & Nazi's, nailed it!
It takes TWO sides to riot...
I'm sorry, but your very niave if you believe that. Trump has shown who he is.....racist bigot repulsican
THE GUYS NAME JASON KEISSLER, HE TALKS WITH A SMILE ON HIS FACE, HE IS GETTING PAID, THEY DONT TALK ABOUT HIM, LINDSEY JUST ATTACKS TRUMP
The remarks that everybody wants to deny, is that there were good & bad on both sides.  This is the narrow thinking, destroying our country!
But they didn't

What about Antefa and BLM? Oh yeah you will give them a pass. Right?
Trump mentioned all of those you didn't.
Or is those other hate groups out of bounds, it must be OK to silence freedom of speech.
Oh yeah, and he's supposed to forget the other racist and hate groups there. How about including ANTIFA and the BLM.
Nope!  Attacks Lindsey instead!  #TrumpsHate
Trump compared Washington to Robert E lee!yeesh some give him a history lesson Lee was arrested for treason!
But of course it won't come down like a hammer or even a feather cuz WHite Surem active n prominent in the White House. #impeachandremove45
I hope they come down like a hammer on the terrorist groups antifa and blm too. 
@maggieNYT Hope for Trump is half past dead. Waiting for him to change is like waiting for Godot. Time to change passivity to action.
Like obama did w/ #BLM?? 

Where were the SJW's when our universities & cities were being burned

Oh, they were doing it. And nothing said
Hoping won't make it so, though. Do something!
words are easily ignored... it is time for the #25thamendment. Please start the process!
Nope @LindseyGrahamSC , Trump hammered Patriots who will not tolerate radicals hell bent on destroying American values.America is watching 
Graham is a coward
It is almost imbecilic to expect this WH to "come down" on white supremacists. Several advisors in WH frm Breitbart espouse & encourage WS!
Where the hell has Sen. Graham been the last several months. 4 to 5 of Trump advisors espouse ideals of w. supremacists. DEMAND they go away
Well how do you feel tonight Mr. Graham?? Sick to your stomach? If not, u r out of touch...T is a danger to democracy and needs to go.
@LindseyGrahamSC  oh, Lindsey . . . click your heels three times
I would not hold your breath.
Let's see, David Duke thanked Trump for a fine endorsement. I'd say Trump brought the hammer down, all right, on the American people.
Jim your a liar.
Dear @LindseyGrahamSC - Have you met Donald Trump?
And they won't. #partyofhate
Well he didn't do now what? Please stand up against him. Don't join him in the gutter. For the honor of our country...#ImpeachTrump
They won't. Obviously.
Senator Graham: I know despite some partisan differences you are a moral man. Please lead the party and evict this man ,humiliation of USA.
And instead he called them good people
When it comes to Trump...hope is for suckers @LindseyGrahamSC
What about these peaceful people?

Who knew?
Really, that the best he's got? No "we will reconvene & start to work on ending White American Naziism"? He's depending on Trump to do this?
Fail. Huge fail. COLOSSAL FAIL.
@realDonaldTrump 

ONLY IF HE COMES DOWN ON #Antifa and #BlackLivesMatter and every other hate group.  Ie:  Crips, Bloods, gangs in prison.
Too late...truth is out
I'm not sure today's circus would befit that description. Wonder what Senator Graham thinks...
Do you think he came down "like a hammer" in today's comments?
When are you gonna get off your @GOP stump and impeach this horrible president? He's RUINED the GOP. RUINED IT.
I shall not hold my breath, for both the Trump administration to take a stand nor the @GOP to hold him accountable. #spinelessGOP
Yeah, that went well.
Narrator: They didn't.
They (he) blew it. Time to censure him (atva minimum Senator. #censuretrump #Charlottesville
I would say that Trump failed today. BIGLY.
WORDS.
They didn't. They empowered White Supremacists / Nazis instead. Where were you, @LindseyGrahamSC
Have you seen the press conference, Lindsey? Watch the press conference, Lindsey.
Nope...try and hope again.
lol I assume this was before Trumpler gave his abomination of a press conference
I was wondering the same.
