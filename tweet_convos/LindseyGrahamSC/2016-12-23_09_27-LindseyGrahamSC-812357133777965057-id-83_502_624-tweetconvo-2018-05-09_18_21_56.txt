My statement on the United Nations resolution on Israel settlements. 
I hope that means all of those members of the UNSC
Even a broken clock like Lindsey Graham is right occasionally. 

.@TomCottonAR @tladd58
This was a BLATANT show of enmity by Obama and we Americans will NOT accept it!!
Messianic Jews are not Jews. Also, Senator is wrong settlements must stop.
@LindseyGrahamSC - it is time to cut our support of UN NOW ! It's a haven for spies & non peaceful groups - cut money now !
- the Potus shows his true colors - shutdown energy with laws & stabs Israel in back our buffer in Middle East
- pass HR 1777 1/21/17 and reins act .
Don't talk about it. Just do it. Enough is enough.
@LindseyGrahamSC  22% of $13.9 billion. That money could house, feed and clothe a lot of Americans every year!
@monica_barona @TomCottonAR @LindseyGrahamSC Fix a lot of your infrastructure too.
* From the mouths of those parroting freedom & democracy but only for Americans and Israelis this is yawningly predicable *
@LindseyGrahamSC TAKE TWO STOPS BEYOND DEFUNDING. QUIT THE UN AND KICK THEM OUT IF NYC. POLLUTION WILL DECREASE IMMEDIATELY
.@TomCottonAR @JetSetterRyan #UNexit Get US out of UN @HeritageOTH @1stbornAmerican @NCCoastalRltr @GQinNC @PPDNews @rtoberl @CR
@alexnwong would either of you mind explaining how supporting the settlers movement is in any way helpful re ME strategy?
I await your reaction to US abstention allowing this resolution to pass.

"You have sat too long here for any good you have been doing. Depart, I say, and let us have done with you. In the name of God, go." 8/
thank you so much for this.  Us American Jews thank you.
@LindseyGrahamSC president elect wanting to get us into a nuclear war &he's directly involved w/ russia & this is your response
@LindseyGrahamSC Nice bullying gentlemen. Why don't we just invade whoever disagrees with us
@LindseyGrahamSC Yet more evidence of GOP pols' singular interest in their own reelection over human rights, 1/n
US national security, and democracy. Supporting Israeli settlements will only fuel the jihad fire.
- I thought that Americans would know, by now, that violently stealing land from indigenous people is wrong.
Sams a troll. Blocked!
wish he were that adamant about immigration issues
@LindseyGrahamSC Tom Cotton? Aren't you the guy who said that he"takes his orders from Netanyahu?"!What a patriot you are.
hey traitor Tom are you willing to go behind @realDonaldTrump back the same way you did with @BarackObama on Iran?
@NoahCRothman @LindseyGrahamSC Hopeful that financial actions against UN will accompany words. Obama is reprehensible.
@LindaSuhler @LindseyGrahamSC you're going to do what, cut off money, you're not even close. They're bought and paid for.
I hope and pray you not only mean it and will also take action immediately
@LindseyGrahamSC Get it if UN kick them out of NY. Most countries there are our enemy's
hate auto correct. Get out of UN and kick out NY
14-0! you&Israel gonna bully&blackmail  whole world?or finally do what is right&endOccupation!Think carefully
Please don't just draw a 'redline" like @POTUS. Follow though on this.
@LindseyGrahamSC. Why don't you fellas aim that "Bipartisan Committee" toward Russia hacking democracy? Beat up democrats after
@LindseyGrahamSC vetoing no effect. All presidents opposed settlements yet we shielded it. Long term bad for Israel&usa.
@LindseyGrahamSC So that is why the US didn't veto it?
Seems to me that Israel should stop settlement expansion and make peace.
@LindseyGrahamSC #dumptheUN
Think carefully: all forms of assistance to Israel imperils Palestinian life&liberty! #FreePalestine
I don't trust you or anyone else in the Wrong wing extremist side of the GOP.
and maybe the anti-Semitic anti-American @UN should be evicted from lower Manhattan? – at Chad's House Of Pain
Thank you Senator Cotton for standing up against this injustice at the UN.
@LindseyGrahamSC you're both worthless and anti American...go live in Israel...please!
- if only "forms of assistance" weren't code words for bullets & bombs.
Good thing US doesn't assist itself much, huh?
@LindseyGrahamSC Good luck with your next 'coalition of the willing'. If you want world to listen to you, grow some principles.
this election is proving #GOP has no principles, why pretend hey do.
@LindaSuhler @LindseyGrahamSC Now what #realDonaldTrump?
@LindaSuhler @LindseyGrahamSC The U.S. Pays $3B a year to the U.N. It's time to get our way or get out.And find another locale.
@ShakingStick @LindseyGrahamSC it's amusing you don't think all forms of US 'assistance' aren't already in serious jeopardy.
The UN is a joke. Has it ever prevented a single war?
yeah plenty.
tell that to the dead Syrians. They'll believe you
Traitor @TomCottonAR beating war drums again.
Sad
@LindseyGrahamSC tbh I don't think most of us could give a shit about your "assistance".
@Mondoweiss @LindseyGrahamSC gd 2 know u got Israel's back even when they violate Intl law & act against US interest #pathetic
@lindseygrahamsc Merry Christmas, SENATOR, Tom Cotton, The Cotton Family; God Bless!
@LindseyGrahamSC Sore losers threatening other nations for going against your wishes?
these hicks are going to be our downfall @TomCottonAR @LindseyGrahamSC
opening the door that much wider for china,
As a Jew and a strong zionist I object to your position. I am for the 2 state solution and a Jewish state.  You are not
@LindseyGrahamSC LOL! Please do cut off aid to Egypt and your beloved Sissi. Aid to Egypt indirectly benefits Israel anyway!
@LindseyGrahamSC Amen my friend.
What exactly makes this resolution "anti-Israel"? Israeli settlements in Palestine violate UN res. 242.
"It is the United States' position that...the withdrawal provision of Res. 242 applies to all fronts, including the West Bank and Gaza." -RR
lol. It's sad you are trying to mimic #Trump. Angling for 2020/24? A closet gay man like you won't win #TomCottonIsGay
Enough with the threat of 'imperilment'. Show some balls, if they vote for it they get no money EVER again. As in NEVER.
@ResilientEarth I've had issues w @LindseyGrahamSC but statement is powerful & supports only Democracy & true ally in Mideast
Thank you
We need more  Technology pharmaceuticals and more places where Woman are allowed to drive !! Great 
thank you.
Tom Cotton got over $2.1 million in campaign ad support from pro-Israel donors
Kumusta @TomCottonAR. Kinapopootan ko naman ang UN. ni manigarilyo sila sa kanilang pugad at susunugin sa lupa Hayaan!
@LindseyGrahamSC I would be paying attention to the ..NUKES.. threats.. OUR Country is in danger.. OURS!!! #BipartisanConcern
yes trump is endangering it, by going around telling everyone we are upping nukes. #theresistance
Dear Tom Cotton, Merry Christmas to you, the one of many, slaves of Israel. You are part of the Swamp that needs to be drained
@LindseyGrahamSC What is your statement on Trump wanting to increase our nuclear arsenal and win a nuclear arms race?
@LindseyGrahamSC By assistance you mean money to buy our military hardware back from us to prop up MIC and garner Campaign $ ?
Thank you for your moral courage, Senator Cotton.
Interesting more I witness a communist county operated by racist. This to shall pass. It's Christmas I believe in peace 2 all.
@LindseyGrahamSC Thank you for standing up for Israel. Merry Christmas!
And the thing is DJT would probably be on board with saving foreign aid/policy dollars.
The U.S. and the Obama administration need to Veto this resolution.
