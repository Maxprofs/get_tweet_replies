This is a horrible bill and Cassidy is a horrible person.  Graham is just awful, too.
So the cancer patient in KY is treated diff than the one in NY? Why would states have diff tx plans for the same diseases? #NoGrahamCassidy
America doesn't want this. When are you going to figure that out?

How do 50 different entities do the job more efficiently than 1 did . Sounds like there will be a lot of duplication of effort
Unless they're poor, like WV & KY, and their state can't make up shortages. But those are mainly poor people & the elderly; you don't care.

You just keep spouting lies. I have not heard you tell the truth once about this nightmare bill designed to make evil billionaires happy.
LIAR.

This bill guts medicaid in all 50 states. Dishonorable that you would strip healthcare from poor,sick & disabled kids all for your donors.
And yet U are throwing more $$ in your revised bill to buy the votes of Maine & Alaska @ the expense of all! Can you be anymore despicable.

New Graham-Cassidy bill text is out. Even their own estimates show Alaska still losing $$... 

@POTUS @AP Many Americans have suffererd$$$ with the rising costs of these premiums!! AMABOCARE NOW! REVERSE OBAMA CARE - We want options!!
Bot
AMERICANS MANDATE AFFORDABLE BETTER OPTIONS - AMABO CARE - REVERSE OBAMA - REPEAL OBAMACARE
@POTUS @AP We cannot take from Americans and give to someone else! It is wrong!! Separate plan for those who can't afford. Reverse OBAMACARE
@POTUS @AP AMABOCARE - REVERSE OBAMACARE - AMERICANS MANDATE AFFORDABLE BETTER OPTIONS! MY PHARMACIST CALLS IS HEALTH INS NOT HEALTH CARE!
Liar
Liar!  GrahamCassiday punishes the elderly, poor, veterans, children, disabled and women for not being rich, white donors.
No Sen,every state has the exact same HCare needs, coverage for everyone at affordable prices paid for by Koch's $ oth billionaires & Corps
to bad the R states are run by complete fools and racists that will try to kill as many poor people as possible.UR a liar Trump w/b proud of
Selfish state legislatures that care more about the Koch Brothers than their constituents will  raise rates for  Pre-E's  #noflexibility
MR CASSIDY, you know know that's a lie! That's why Kimmel is gaslighting you every night for lying to his face. No Trumpcare!!! No no no no
Your bill is awful. I am not sure if you read or comprehend what your underlings gave you.
Maybe I'm just dense. They're all filled with American citizens. They all get sick with the same diseases, why are the needs different?
"give" is an interesting word for "takes away funding"
#JustLetObamacareImplodeOrRepealItEntirely #IAmTiredOfPayingAMonthlyTAXForNothing #MakeCongressLiveUnderObamacare @realDonaldTrump #NoTAXES
This guy is an MD but could care less about Americans.  He is proposing a bill that will essentially kill Americans: old, sick, poor.  Sick

Not disappointed in you, Kimmel should stick to what he knows and not play Senator.
LA makes cuts to HC year after year, losing 2 major hospitals in BR alone & you want us to rely on LA to run our care srsly? #GrahamCassidy
Return to the normal order and work on a bipartisan bill that is transparent, fully vetted and studied.  First, do no harm.

First do no harm!
Fact Checker: Cassidyâ€™s misleading claim that preexisting-conditions protection is â€˜absolutely the sameâ€™
Please read @NPR's easy-to-read explanation of the bill. This bill would allow states to drop coverage for pre-existing conditions. Stop it!
Wrong. It lets insurance companies discriminate like in the pre-Obamacare era.
Any chance this happens without McCain?  The people are counting on you!!!  Get us out of AHA!
This is false. You are doing grave damage to our people. If you proceed with this it is heartless and wrong.
You lied and continue to lie!
You GOP scum are NAZI scum in suits. You act like polite nice gentlemen to commit indirect genocide and discrimination/racism by proxy.

Bull shit!

Wrong!

Horrible
Your party is more ingested in repeal then actually putting forth a good bill.

It Robs the elderly of Medicaid for nursing homes with block grants. You know your bill sucks because you tried to bribe Alaska and hi
How do you sleep at night your bill is against women's healthcare
There are not protections
You think the words adequate and affordable protect preexisting conditions they don't.  If your bill doesn't say you can't charge more then
You are wrong, you know it. Are you afraid of trump, did he threaten you, did he threaten someone you love? Please reach out
You take away resources from ny to give to your own party States.  You got to have that Koch money. This bill is a disgrace and you lie
No your bill kills protections for preexisting conditions.  I already pay 1443.00 a month and I can be charged 27k more .

Shame on you for not knowing (refusing to see) what you do not know.  Shame is what physicians feel, described with eloquence here:
No.
That's a great plan-punish states that properly implemented affordable healthcare by taking their $ and giving to Red states who did not!

Stop! Just stop it.  This isnâ€™t about health care, itâ€™s about tax cuts for the PACS. Youâ€™ve sold your soul to the devil. And you know it!
How exactly will it since you are now 3 votes down.
This was done totally irresponsibly Bill. WTH were you thinking?  Are you are real MD or a FAKE? BAD BILL. No hearings, etc
Fix it instead of repealing it.  McCain saves millions of lives today by saying he will vote No.
I am your constituent, and if you vote for this, I will vote you out. Your plan doesn't pass the @jimmykimmel test or mine!
