Not with you in charge, Skippy. Wouldn't trust you with my dogs healthcare. Resign.
Haha good luck
Please call Rand & explain details. Call AZ & VT GOV to push the RINO's with WI insight #badgercare.
Koch boys holding back on your reelection campaign donation, Scooter?

You will take any opportunity to force people to pee in a cup.
Don't tell me this ass can run for re-election!
I'm sure he will run another total failure of a Presidential campaign
He is running for gov again 
How could Wisconsin stand this man for another term?
Ugh I know, he's terrible. I don't know that there's a good Dem candidate, short of Feingold or Baldwin who could beat him. Need TB in USS
Butt hole
Seems @RonJohnsonWI has carved out a special provision in his bill that rewards you for your past negligence. No wonder your excitement.
Rojo Skippy and Eddie Munster the evil triumvirate!
U also have been effective in  denying Wisconsin residents the right to vote! Ur credibility sucks!
Never.  Not 1 state Medicaid administrator approves of this bill.  U all kind of suck at this no?  Proven to suck at it actually?
Scootus. It's literally called the Affordable Care Act. Stop.
Scoooots. I pay $148 a month for good coverage. I'm happy. Also, show us some data. Talk is cheap.
Is there a healthcare based organization in this country that agrees with you? These don't.
Just NAMBLA agrees
Failure to do so strips us of the dignity to buy an affordable plan on our own.
Affordable is a big word...
My BCBS at $480/mo *was* affordable, post ACA my same PPO rose to $1200/mo -- not affordable. Plus, my son doesn't need prenatal coverage
Relative taking drug discovered in 1930s. Went from $3k/month 3 years ago to $11k/mo now. $500/mo in UK. Pre-existing needs 2 B covered!!!
Need to work on affordability side of the equation. Regardless of a backlash, it is time to regulate HC cost like HC is a utility.
A successful outcome will include Congress Persons being on the HC plan.
@clementbrm Connecticut representatives are a nightmare. Please don't let them make the decision for us...
On Obamacare, I can't even get an xray of broken toes, will this be better? If each state does it's own, how do we take it if we move?
This state has not been effective, efficient, nor accountable since you took over.
Amen!
Didn't y'all already have like 70 "chances" to repeal and replace the ACA? Oh right, better to ram it thru without a CBO score #GOP
time has not improved your thinking it is still self centered You must be Proud of yourself for putting a racist imbecile in the W.H.
Anyone that didn't vote for Obamacare change should be FIRED!
How much money have you each received from health insurance companies?
Insurance companies, not states, will continue to dictate our healthcare system if we continue to allow them to exist. #MedicareForAll
Because you helped write it and are just drooling over the thoughts of block grants you can spend however you want? #yourlastterm
Shame on you!!  This bill will cost families more than OC has ever!  Just looking to support the GOP. Good little minion.
Stick to Barbeque Govna, not politics!
so what do you get out of this bill? Asking for the millions of Americans who will be hurt by it.
We need another chance to repeal and replace you, too. Recall Walker v 2.0
No, please don't pass this bill
http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2017/09/oregon_hardest-hit_state_in_na.html …    Another lie.  Oregon hardest-hit state in US under GOP's new health  care bill
Or not.
You are a joke
@SenJohnMcCain is a traitor. He took money saying he'd repeal and replace, but is only interested in plauing footsy with his buddy Chuck S
Not gonna happen. Go back to sucking the teat of your new corporate masters.
Says a lot about you that you support this bill.  And none of it is good.
What's the CBO score? Oh, you don't care,  this is just a political game to you
Graham duped you. He never intended for it to pass.
If @ScottWalker likes this bill, you know it's a dog. Death to the GCHJ debacle. #DotardGOP
Even board member on high risk board wrote Op-ed WI high risk pools were unaffordable and way out of reach TO MOST who needed and wanted it!
You and Paul Ryan are LYING and DECEIVING once again and YOU know it.  WI ins. rates have increased at much lower rate than pre-ACA!!
Really?  With "successful" High Risk pools most WI folks couldn't afford pre-ACA in WI?  500,000+ wanted on it.  Only 22,000 could afford!
@ScottWalker Dear sir would you want your family to have this plan?  Your mother your kids? Be honest with yourself #NoGrahamCassidy
Why even bother with Tweeting?  Who are you trying to convince?  I don't see many with anything favorable to say. Should tell you something!
People move from state to state.  What about their insurance.
Let's face it, you all don't want to fix ... Let's just be real and cut the bull already Scott!! You know it's true. Don't u?
Gov Walker please suggest President Trump UNDO Obama's EO giving Congress an exemption from Obamacare!
all 50 states Directors of Medicaid say, EMPHATICALLY, no. Sorry.

If you think Wisconsin is a shining example, you must have a #DevosEducation
Scott, Sen Graham: This STUPID bill "redistributes money from states that expanded Medicaid to states that didn't," says the Chic Tribune..
Screw you, Scott - worst governor in the country.
Bye Felicia 
You're an embarrassment to our country.
I guess that's why the fed govt manages your upcoming SS payments (lol). The states can DENY pre-existing conditions. OCare does not!
Chance for @GOP to finally win "win" at something? Can you seriously look at your constituency & tell them that is is for them? HELL NO!

I agree get rid of the current president and speaker
You’re crippling citizens in the name of ideology.
Shut up. It's over. #GrahamCassidyDeathBill
No one ran on replacing anything. Just REPEAL OBAMACARE!!
States are totally incompetent particularly when run by governors like you. This is not a plan for good health care in America.
We were promised real repeal, of ALL of Obamacare. This isn't that.
Oh and we all know about the super PAC of dark money contributed to your campaign- I'd say you should lawyer up.
You may be more efficient than the Feds, but effective and accountable? No way, pal.
I don't think anyone w/ a brain or a agrees.U r very misguided. We'll help straighten u out in 2018. Start looking for a new job.

OBEY THE CONSTITUTION. You are either a Conservative or you are not. Pick one. Obey the Constitution.
With what are you going to replace it? A new boat in your garage?
If Congress not effective, then we need to elect new representatives who can do the job.
Way above your pay-grade, Scotty.  Let the adults talk about this... stick to the simple grifting of Wisconsin, that's your talent.
Horrific.
Scott I'm disappointed. This is Obamacare lite. Present REAL repeal to congress and I'll support it
Let me help you with your ratio

You can't do shit as a governor, but you probably think you helped by tweeting people who can't vote on it
This is your chance to become a killer for Koch  Scott. Looks like you are willing to kill more Americans than 9-11/yr. #MAGA?
This is one of the worst ideas to come out of DC.
you can't even manage WI roads and infrastructure - you've already done enough damage to schools and the poor!!

@LindseyGrahamSC when one liar retweets another. #traitors


Against Graham-Cassidy Trumpcare:
* Doctors 
* Every state Medicaid head
* All Dems and many GOP govs…
Next year is our chance to vote you OUT!
NO, WRONG.  This is a garbage bill being crammed through at the last minute and you know it.
apparently you're delusional.

That Republicans are bribing Murkowski by letting Alaska KEEP OBAMACARE pretty much destroys the idea that this is better than Obamacare

Croney capitalist hates anything that protects citizens and doesn't allow huge corporations to prey on them

The individuals in charge of helping those most in need in every single state in our nation came out in opposition to GOP’s #Trumpcare bill. https://twitter.com/aslavitt/status/911018434804068352 …
You are a traitor to this country, pandering to the wealthy so they continue campaign contributions. This bill gives them a huge tax break
giving you access to a checkbook filled with money is a pretty bad idea.  After you pay your sears bill you'll cut a check to the Kochs liar
Shame on you
Why is it only politicians support this? Point to any experts, governor.
Trying to spin a terrible bill as about states vs fed.
Some states are great at using taxpayer money to buy jobs from Chinese companies who are given preferences in US legal system. #MCGA!
Nope ... will never happen ... !!! #Obamacare will remain.
Say no to this terrible health plan. It will not make states more effective. It will deny healthcare to women and harm humans.
Tax cuts. Party before country

We know this! Work on your Do nothing Republican brothers!
Why not just fix what's wrong with Obama Care. Why so hell bent on owning your own????
You're an embarrassment to the state of Wisconsin! Clown!
States actually balance their budgets (!!) and cannot afford this.
Why are you so gay dude?
What a crock. #Liar
This is absurd, states cannot manage this better on a simple point its WORSE from the beginning. Selling soul smh
I hope the Mueller investigation also includes you scotty. We know you cheated in your election and did the same for trump.
people will die. their blood will be on your hands. veterans, children, elderly, disabled, those with chronic diseases.
You are lying too
What would you know? You didn't take the expansion money which hurt Wisconsinites.
When an entire industry is against something, shouldn't you listen? Pure politics over people. + Obama hate.
So you are saying these organizations are wrong  politics vs professional organization.
Ask yourself why you have to lie to get a healthcare bill passed.., and why every Medical Association is against it
Ask yourself why you have to lie to get a healthcare bill passed.., and why every Medical Association is against it
The AMA disagrees with you
Disgraceful

@LindseyGrahamSC we don't want this bill. Put country first!
Absolutely NOT
our republican governor ran our state into the ground!   don't trust em anymore than federal people.   even  less.
If that's true Scott, why can't SC maintain roads with $900m a year from the Feds?
Really? Missouri can't even afford to mow along roads, let alone fix any of them. Efficient and accountable? Laughable!
Expecting them to manage federal money for MO healthcare.? They have zero care for the people who need help but hey they'll out 4 the rich.


No, just no! Try reading the bill! #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
Really?Why can't Oklahoma keep its schools open, pay it's teachers, and fix it's roads and bridges?I'm supposed to trust them w/ healthcare?
Unfortunately, Texas isn't any of those things.
@VP: do not trust federal government w/healthcare. If U truly believe, how can we trust @GOP with any aspect of our government?  We can't!
Wrong! States lack the infrastructure, human capital, experience, leverage 2 do this efficiently or cost effective. Not how u fund a tax cut
@VP should not trust federal government w/healthcare. If U truly believe how can we trust @GOP with any aspect of our government?  We can't!
Your concept is theory without proof. On the other hand, Medicare has withstood the test of time. Why not upgrade it for all?
You know who’s even more effective? Switzerland and France. Let’s do universal healthcare! Thanks! Xoxo
Pass it and you're cooked at the next gubernatorial election!
They are? Then why don't they have their own armies?
@LindsayGrahamSC why does the @GOP hate Middle class, poor, & elderly who all feel they are standing in front of @GOP firing squads. FIX ACA
Keep ignoring Americans. It's working well for your group.
People will die because of your greed. Fin
What are WIs plans for providing affordable, comprehensive health ins options? Can I get adequate coverage w my predicting condition?
Official talking point
Here's what the #GrahamCassidyBill will cost each state and its devastating This is simply GOP legalized mass murder
Actually, states r mostly worse. Esp yours.
You will eventually be removed from office and then you will end up in jail.
I don't know what state YOU live in, but that is patently untrue in SC
Not when you defund Medicaid!  600,000+ Washingtonians would lose insurance. Doesn't sound better to me.
That's ironic coming from Mr WEDC loan giveaway.
"States are more effective, efficient, & accountable than fed. govt."

Not if you live in NC. HB2, racial gerry., black voter suppression...
No way I trust my state to do the right thing.
More like this is your chance to screw all Americans.  Good luck ever getting re-elected.  Better enjoy what you have now.
Every state has said "NO".  They do not have the $ or time to develop systems.  This bill is reckless, like the GOP party has become
States have had 240 years to create a universal healthcare system. Didn't. Your problem is you think med care is a privilege. Wrong.
You can't call yourself decent or principled if you vote yes for this bill. Have you even read it? Understand the consequences.
