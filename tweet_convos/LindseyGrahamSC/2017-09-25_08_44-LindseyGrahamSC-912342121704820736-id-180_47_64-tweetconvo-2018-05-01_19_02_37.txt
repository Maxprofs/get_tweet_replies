Despicable.
You will devastate vulnerable Americans
Starts at 2:00.
Ends at 2:20.
High fives all around!
Shame on you
No, you chose your wallet over innocent people's Lives. Heartless!
  
Just say NO to #GrahamCassidy
Lindsey you know what we call cowered politics it's when politicians attack the most vulnerable part of the population.

Don't you have work to do...you are addicted to twitter
You guys are doing gr8, Senator, but can't you get your policy wonk, .@RickSantorum some airtime?? :D Be encouraged Left mindless w/fear #GC
What exactly does Graham Cassidy say before you pass it?  Does it have maternity leave?  former pro-abortion lady said no called 18 ins. co.
How about Puerto Rico!!!! Assmunch
#SCB4CNN #SaveACA #GrahamCassidyKills #GrahamCassidyNO  #YourLastTerm
Why don't you get your friend @SenJohnMcCain to vote for this bill. #RepealAndReplace #Obamacare with #GrahamCassidy Bill.
Wow! One committee meeting!!! Come on-SO ridiculous!! Shame on all of you.
Why do you want to kill me?
When are hearings scheduled? CBO report received? Do we know the implications? Do they matter or is it just about the politics?
Hey, @GOPSenate so, you offer deals to Alaska and Maine - how about you just LEAVE the ACA, and FIX IT for ALL THE STATES?
You would send out jaunty invites to the crucifixion of Christ.
Take Collins with you----She's probably at the closest Rotary Club lunch meeting getting a plaque and her photo for her to post of Facebook
Please stop
Absolutely disgusting removing disabled protesters for fighting for their lives!
If you were not destroying the health care system. This last minute hearing on. Bill still being drafted last night would be a joke
Healthcare is pointless if we are all toasted. Please tell your POTUS to get a brain & ratchet back the BS with NK. #Playingwithfire #madmax
What? A full 20 minutes of debate? This is such a foolhardy way to run HC. But hey, it's only a sixth of the economy!
Work with ALL @Republican's forget any bi-partisan crude. They'll never work with U. #Democrats with a strictly party line vote.Gave us this
Hell with you Lindsey for putting a females name on my Bill. I hope Lindseycare fails bc let’s face it that’s what you do best!!!  Loser!
This bill is terrible
Is it true?
Shucks. I'll be busy.

#fallofthethirdstinkeroo
Millions will lose healthcare so Republicans can give their donors huge tax cuts. 250 billion!
Will the Senate Finance Committee get to vote on the bill? Asking for a friend.
How much money were you paid to do this? SHAME
We thought you were reasonable , but we see you are in the Koch brothers pocket.   I hop that you want the same crappy insurance puppet man!
Until Republicans start working with Democrats for regular order, and public hearings, "We the People..." are NOT onboard. Period.
How exciting. Aren't you still working on the parachute as you're on the way out of the plane? Heard you had a new version just released.
Do.the.right.thing! Give Americans the same healthcare plan U have! I want my tax $ spent on HC for all, not the shit U waste it on!
Go back to regular order and no cornhusker deals - you know the ones you said you hated back in June?
Is giving Alaska 3% and Maine 43% more money for HC for those states a Cornhusker Sweet deal that you hate so much? You are a hypocrite.
When are you going to have a hearing on Kushner's emails?? You know the same hearings you had for Hillary? Where's the gop outrage?
Why don't you just support mass executions of all the innocent people you would kill with this bill? Same result.
Use the money that trump hoards for his every weekend golfing vacations and help the people in this country. What about PR and USVI? 
Your bribes to the "no" senators can be viewed as bribery...the $$ went to their state after the no vote...will be challenged in court!!
Strange... All I see at 2PM is "Hearing on war criminals @LindseyGrahamSC & @BillCassidy" to determine the sentence that fits the crime.
https://twitter.com/AARPpolicy/status/911255334420926464 … @SenateFinance Here is some info to pass along to the committee for consideration #KillTheBill will harm millions
#GrahamCassidy could mean skyrocketing costs for 50- to 64-year-olds. See state estimates in our new report: http://bit.ly/2fl9BDf  
Nah.
Need to get your buddy on board or it is DOA
How can you support this immoral bill?

Token.  How many witnesses called by Dem's on the Committee?
MA, Worked 70 hrs per wk with crises, victims of abuse & LE.  Disabled from RA. Need nursing assistance.  Will die alone if your bill passes
If it's so great then you should easily get bipartisan support and don't need reconciliation
If there’s a god I hope he punishes u for proposing such a heinous bill. And if not, may your fate be in the hands of the ppl you screwed.
http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-obamacare-senate-mystery-20170924-story.html …
One hearing on a horrible and unconstitutional bill and you act like it’s regular order. Is selling your soul for American lives worth it?
Senate Republicans unsure what their healthcare bill would do, even as they push ahead on it
How much time---a few minutes?  The seriousness of our lives requires way more time to bring in doctors, nurses, patients and other experts.
I thought you would never vote yes for bills that bribed certain Senators. What has happened to you?
You use to be honorable until the Koch Brothers bought you off !!
KEEP THIS HC OUT OF POLITICS!!!!
SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT
UNWAVERINGLY
Hahaha
Y'all should be meeting to discuss the mental state of the guy in the WH.
Consider it dead, terrible bill and you should be ashamed for writing it.
I am a Dem who always respected you----that has changed-----you should be ashamed of yourself as you try to buy votes
Did Trump promise you Secretary of State for lying to the public?
you are trying to buy votes----you should be ashamed of yourself as you dump the elderly and those with pre existing conditions
(still thinks socialism is a naughty word)
Where's the CBO score?
In case you missed it. NO ONE favors your bad bill.
And ending at 2:01.30!  #pathetic
At least now we know graham isn't a "moderate republican," rather he's also a radical right wing extremist. Sayonara to your legacy.
One hearing for a bill that affects 300M and 1/6 the economy is unacceptable @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @SenJohnMcCain @SenAlexander
SAY A PRAYER IF YOU IGNORE THIS AT YOUR PERIL. 230 organizations against!
BREAKING: 230+ organizations just sent a letter to the Senate urging opposition to #GrahamCassidy. Read it here: http://bit.ly/2fKZDIm  
Please Sen don't do this! People depend on Medicaid to live. Work to improve the ACA for all.  #SaveACA #VoteNoGrahamCassidy
Hearing from the people - #NoGrahamCassidy  #nograhamcassidy #nograhamcassidy Are you listening?
Hope it goes down!
What are you doing about the dire situation in Puerto Rico? Your only concern is keeping wealthy donors happy. Shame on you!
No need to consider. WE DO NOT SUPPORT THIS SHITE. NO to #GrahamCassidy. Millions lose cover, prices skyrocket for everyone else. #SaveACA
I'll just rewatch the Hindenburg footage on YouTube. Thanks for the heads up though :-)
#GFYGOP
Poll: Majority disapprove of #GrahamCassidy repeal bill
PLEASE VOTE NO @Lindsey Graham. #WeWantOurCountryBack #WakeUp #WorkOnATrueBipartisanSolution
Looks like they're ready :
Organizers say ~200 activists, including ~80 in wheelchairs, are already outside room 4 Graham-Cassidy hearing.…
Literally no one in the medical community supports this. That alone would stop those who actually govern & have morality. Guess you do not.
Creep.
So,with the latest amendments to GrahamCassidy bill ie: buying Maine, Alaska and Arizona's vote is the new GOP plan
It boggles themindcurrent Repubs Ncharge DO NOT CARE abt health/safety except rich/white. DO YOUR JOBS, or at the very least try&Bhumans.
Relief for Puerto Rico NOW!
I hope it passes. Obama care was a lie to the American people.
Consider this: Your Koch habit is going to kill us.
You are a snake!
Just heard that preexisting conditions will not be able to afford healthcare. My son father of 4 with type 1 diabetes will be dead. Thanks
There are a lot of pissed people who don't want you to cut their medicare/medicaid.  I wouldn't lie to them...

What a hearing.   I think we already heard what you are doing. It's not good
You'll kill more REPUBLICANS & democrats ea year than 9-11 just to get   from rich ppl u give tax cuts to. #DrainTheSwamp
Consider this: Your cruel mess of a partisan ideological bill declares war on women, the sick, the disabled, the poor and the elderly.
How can @SenateFinance allow special privileges to one State over another State? We are the United States of America! NO on #GrahamCassidy.
What a joke.
History will long remember that you were in favor of making #healthcare unaffordable for Americans with pre-existing conditions.
Unsubstantial hearing for a inhumane bill
Please just stop, you @GOP asses are not the only Americans that matter. You’re gonna get owned tonight on @CNN! That’ll be fun to watch
Graham-Cassidy is stunningly cruel and incompetently drafted.  The GOP in a nutshell.
I take comfort n knowing that even though u sold ur soul 2 the devil 4 this legislation, IT STILL WON'T PASS! U STILL LOSE! #UChosePoorly
Americans are fighting for their lives and you’re trying to pass legislation that will literally kill them! WTF is wrong with you?
Can't wait to tune in to watch you attempt to lie your way to a W, because that's clearly all that matters to you.
Snake!!!!!!
the ploy to give Alaska and Maine special consideration is nothing less than bribery.
I respect you enormously, but I can't back you on this one, man. I do't think it's the right solution. I hope we can still be friends.
Your bill is dying and should be dead by lack of oxygen soon.
Most Americans don't want your bill. Are you listening? Use Graham/Cassidy for Congress and let us know how it goes. Experiment on yourself!
So you consider if you can find a way to take away the insurance that allowed me life saving care. Should be that easy
Please tell the truth—the entire truth.
Wow 3 while hours on 18 percent of us economy? Honor @SenJohnMcCain by scrapping this mess and restoring regular order.
You and the rest of the @GOP are the worst of America. I can't wait til you all retire or get voted out of office. Your bill is toilet paper
I stand against harm to our veterans, our children, our elderly, our disabled citizens, those with preexisting conditions, and WOMEN.
Because you love the smell of killing poor people in the afternoon.
What lies are on your GOP agenda today?
Here's hoping you fail! You disappoint!
Hear this NO to #GrahamCassidy no no a thousand times NO! No version of #Trumpcare only yes is to #MedicareForAll
Sir, don't give up. The American People will be with you, even through defeat, if you fight all the way to the end. Sir.
I know. I emailed comments. Read them!!!!!! 
Instead of Healthcare let's call yours KochCare
I am curious why was Romneycare good for Massachusetts but the affordable care act is somehow bad? What's the difference?
Klindsay get Trump out of office
Lindsey! Just take the money and run. You've lost all credibility with average Americans.
You know this is not the way to govern. There is something wrong with you
Protect the fellow veterans..
Are they going to discuss this?
If North Korea shoots down a plane what will Congress do? What will @LindseyGrahamSC do to stop this march towards war?
LOL
Throwing carrots to states----is this what you have become
Great, give it the two hours that 1/6 of our economy, not to mention the health of our citizens, deserves.
morally bankrupt racist
FU
Where is the CBO score?
I'm gonna watch and witness a US Senator lie to the American public.
Hundreds lined up to protest bill.  Listen to them.  Send aid to #PuertoRico! #Americans are going to start dying soon!
So @LindseyGrahamSC -still pushing to attack the Healthcare of Americans for the Koch? Meanwhile a real problem is brewing at the WH.
You are a loser...even your buddy bent ya over the couch #McCain
Mike, I'm absolutely against this bill but I believe we should be civil. I hope I didn't offend you by my comment
Your bill must die, so Americans can live.

Now, please GFY.
Hey GRAHAM- how are you enjoying your CADILLAC GOLD STAR HEALTHCARE? YOU KNOW, THE ONE THE TAXPAYERS PAY FOR?
#VoteNoGrahamCassidy
What you are doing is beyond disgraceful: bribing states to vote for adding to division of DT. No healthcare would cover your sickness.

If you too are disappointed in Sen @BillCassidy #GrahamCassidy let them know it - call (202) 224-3121 
Best today, you've got this. #PressOn
Why vote before the CBO scores it? That's flying blind with people's lives... #NoScoreNoVote
How much money did you take in order to have your name on it in an effort to coerce McCain to go along with it?
Vote No, the American people do not want genocide
Genocide. LOL
Why would we believe anything you guys say?!? #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
Oh, #WeReadIt. Section 106 allows states to waive underwriting req's. Insurers could charge through the roof for preexisting conditions. 
So many lies...
Sen @BillCassidy called our reading of his health care bill on pre-existing conditions false. Here’s how we read it: http://n.pr/2fAWevD  https://twitter.com/BillCassidy/status/910316563047337984 …
Good luck with that.
#GrahamCassidy
The ultimate question on Graham-Cassidy.

Feel free to share if it helps people. 
More lying?  How about kids?!? #GrahamCassidy
Avalere, a consulting firm, modeled Graham-Cassidy's cap on Medicaid over time. Look what it does to children and the disabled. SAVAGE.
