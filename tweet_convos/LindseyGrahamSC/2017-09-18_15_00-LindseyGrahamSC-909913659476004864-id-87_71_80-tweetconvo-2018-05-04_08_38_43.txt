Sound like @SenatorCollins will more likely a "NO" and @lisamurkowski a "yes" vote after got excoriated by Trump voters
These people are going to strip the people from their needed care. This is insane that their base can't even figure this one out. #insane
This mooch is making his career ending move Pushing this crap for the 6th time! If you all knew how to write a law it'd at least be bearable
I used to respect @LindseyGrahamSC for standing up for us. Not anymore. #KillTheBill #DoYourJob #helpamericans #stophurtingus
@LindseyGrahamSC your name will forever be linked with a historic betrayal of public trust. My Mom will die if you have your way. #resist
Until now I thought Lindsey Graham was more of a statesman. Not anymore. #disillusionedrepub
@HouseGOP 95% of the Red states are poor and rely on Obama Care. If you kill them with this new bill who is going to vote for you in 2020 ?
Watch the VIDEO. Find out what is really in the bill. On @MSNBC with @JRubinBlogger
Despicable
I hope you're enjoying your taxpayer funded Healthcare while you try to take away ours.
Dead set on raping and killing the poor. Fuck these people.
This man is just evil, People in Kentucky are crazy for continuing to vote for this monster
In all my years as a voting Repub. I have never seen anything like this. Obsessed with negating OBAMA my party is withering & I fear dying.
The demo lost to the most incompetent candidate of all time in Donald Trump. They should be more concerned about withering away.
People will die because of this. Heartless GOP! We will remember in 2018!
Last time around there were only 3 GOP votes against it. How many of those 3 have changed their mind?  You're a hack GOP site.
THESE MEN ARE LIARS @BillCassidy  @LindseyGrahamSC @SenateMajLdr
JUST IN: American Medical Association comes out against new ObamaCare repeal bill http://hill.cm/UrYXlMA  
No. No, it does not. #ACA has helped save millions of lives. It simply needs to be reviewed, FIXED & supported to ensure sustainability.
Who is paying for this repeal? Doctors and big pharm?

9. Graham & Cassidy are going around saying that under their bill, if a state likes Obamacare, it can keep it. That's a lie.

No conserv who cheers ripping away the insurance for babies born with critical diseases (for tax cuts) can EVER claim to be pro-life again.
this satanic fucking turtle
You're taking away my health care.  He'll has a place for you Trump lovers

#GreatReads: The staggering hypocrisy of Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham: http://bit.ly/2xkjGXg  @mattyglesias 
I am so disappointed in the GOP, and especially Graham.  I already knew McConnell is inhumane.
Shame on all of you.  I as an American can not express the sadness I feel.  And there are no words sufficient to describe the GOP.
Vote No
Not again...
I spy a human turtle hybrid.  Will he be covered by your new plan or is having no soul a pre-existing condition?  #SAD!
Majority will protest against you   We are so ready.  No repeal and replace Obamacare
There's a big payday in it for the @gop. $400 million in funds being withheld until they do it.
HOPING YOU WILL NOT TRY TO PASS THIS HEARTLESS BILL>Once again the Rep show they have"0" heart.Do not bring it up.Blood on your hands

When will be able to rest easy and not have to worry about the GOP ruining our healthcare with their dangerous & immoral repeals?
Enough Red States are being paid off with Blue State money.
Thank you for your tweet POLITICO! #RepealAndReplaceACA
Republican NH Gov. says he cannot support Cassidy/Graham bill in its current draft.
too little too late
First, Americans Do Not want to pay for YOUR insurance,No Senate or Congress. Period. So, as soon as we save $$$ on that, we're good.
@SenateGOP why not give Americans the same healthcare plans, options, rates members of Congress receive? We don't deserve what you get?
Mitch. Still trying to please his master.
Why is the GOP so insistent on killing Americans?
Follow the money! Rich Americans won't be dying for lack of care. Welcome to the Oligarchy brought to you by the @gop.
#MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
I asked people to share what it's like to live in a country with universal health care. The responses that came in were incredible. 
Senator Graham, will Congress be exempt from coverage set out in your bill?  We will all have what you're having!
Really ???
You people need to get a life.
Momentum builds for train wrecks, too. 
And @LindseyGrahamSC 's bill is as harmful for Americans as a train wreck. 
Just saying.
Shameful Government Hacks.
Where's the CBO evaluation? Disgraceful, Lindsey!
This is a fkn nightmare
but wait for it. Honorable senator McCain will rip it because they are rushing it.  Said the senator that helped kill first bill!!
@SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr momentum building for your replacement too
@SenMajLdr JUST CAN'T STOP BOWING TO HIS CORPORATE MASTERS... OH WAIT I FORGET THE "L" IN BOWING... I MEANT BLOWING.
--> And Millions Of Obamacare Using Trump Supporters Are *Whistling Thru The Graveyard*  ---> "I'm Not Scared"
Trumpcare, the care that kills

Here we go again  RT @politico: Momentum builds for Obamacare repeal http://politi.co/2xLTTsi 
Among the public, it's dead as a doornail. Among GOP a-holes who want a tax cut, it has life. F this!
There's no room for democratic institutions or procedures in minority rule politics
Call your representatives, this has to be the last gasp of this horrid plan. Notice how they try and sneak it in and rush it.
No mo money  in the well ....
GOP after 6 months: special prosecutor witch hunt, no wall yet, failed #ObamaCare repeal. NO MORE CUCKS + RINOs!
4give me, Lord, but please give each evil, heartless, greedy piece of shit that votes 4 this death penalty bill his/her own back, 7 times 7.
..and then the bottom will fall out leading to the demise of the Republican party.Nobody to blame but yourselves.We'll make sure you own it!
Just do something for the American people. If government officials didn't get a special version of Obamacare then it would have been fixed
REPEAL IT
Euthanize it...its the only humane thing to do.
What "momentum "?
Gender Bender #glennthrush cannot even get Zis stories "straight"
True republiKKKans care about people #TrumpIsAWhiteSupremacist #NaziBucketChallenge #TheDouchebagChallenge #GOPisComplicit @GOP
Republicans took your slaves away.
You talk about republiKKKans? #TrumpIsAWhiteSupremacist #NaziBucketChallenge   #TheDouchebagChallenge #GOPisComplicit
Yeah let's just ignore the fact that most Americans do not just want it repealed! #MedicareForAll
I'm totally for a one payer system as long as we can raise income tax to 40% and a 25% sales tax.
Fast food workers are simply going to have to pay more into the system.
That turtle just never goes away. Evil KKK bastard.
