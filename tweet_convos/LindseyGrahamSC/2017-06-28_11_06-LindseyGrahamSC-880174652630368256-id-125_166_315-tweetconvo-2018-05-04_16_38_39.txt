Bring Back Flynn ! @mflynnJR @POTUS
DO *NOT* UNDERMINE THE LAW, Senator. 
Sen Graham. Will you tell us why you are doing this? We deserve to know & the truth is better than rumor.
the American people need to know what they are up to and trying to cover for Trump
I'm a Maddow fan & this may be the case but I'd like to hear the Senator's reasoning seeing as how he tweeted it.
I would never believe anything that comes out of his mouth, he has consistently show he will side with Trump

If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed.......and we will deserve it.
I trusted you to put the country before party..Your latest action to undermine FBI shows you are not.Totally disappointed. stay out of it.
Damn right! We KNOW illegal & traitorous activities took place. We insist on knowing the entire truth!

DireCircumstances requireAction If Congress Doesnt think HackingNuclear PP require animmediate responsethen Maybe everyoneof youare Traitors
@LindseyGrahamSC ...why are you allowing the DNC server to go without a real investigation? A private company is NOT sufficient. #DoYourJob
Sessions is trump/putins  man he's  N deep as well as others ,this Russian thing happen w DT be4 he announced his run
We know what @ChuckGrassley's up to. What's up w/ U talking 1 game then another? You're not going to be here forever; think of your legacy!
You r prosecutor do re-tweeting your attempt s trump undermine the investigation of the attack on our nation & those involved?
It's their way to discredit the FBI and stop Trump investigation!

Just let Russia take over as long as GOP wins at all costs right?!!
POTUS Trump? Never been under investigation The Russian hacking is an on going plot of theres, they do it every election U can fact check it
AND?
You are doing this to try to undermine the investigation.
WHY, R U INTERFERRING FOR DT? LET MUELLER DO HIS JOB.
It's a leak not a hack stop lying. The American people know 17 agencies didn't agree and no agency looked at the servers.
Why?
Putins going to say to trump , "o, u look lovely my dear" & then trump is going to give him the keys to the front door to the whitehouse!
Complicit
Stay out of the only trustworthy investigation going on.
Yes, so they can squash the investigation. Power over country, Comrades
Yep!!  Lindsey is a sell out.
If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed.......and we will deserve it.
POTUS Job is to Serve and Protect.Unprepared WeakTrump let his country down.Failed to Protect Served as Putin's LapDog. Fire the Apprentice
Senator Graham: please don't allow any weakening or lessening of the sanctions against Russia! Our children are depending upon this!
What the F...k is wrong with you, Comrade Graham? #GOPRussia @FBI...#LindseyGraham needs to be investigated.
First step in draining
The deep deep swamp
I'm very upset about this. When politics stands in the way of justice and finding out the truth, it is a bad sign for this country.
Were there Warrants GRANTED for the non-existed Meddling?  FACT = Obama hacked w/o warrant
Your trying to discredit this investigation, no proud moment to retweet
Why is this necessary.  Seems an attack in the investigation itself.  Not ok.
You nailed it!
@ChuckGrassley @LindseyGraham KNOW #FlynnFlippedFirst 

Can't wait for first #Traitors #Arrests
First make deals get the best deals
#Kushner's #Flynn's #Sessions lies & omissions on SF86 of over 20 mtgs with the Russians = tip #TrumpRussia ICEBURG
#ObstructionOfJustice
#Kushner's omission of a $296M loan is just the tip of the #TrumpRussia ICEBURG
#ObstructionOfJustice
#TrumpRussia Investigated because we have Russian Spies in our White House & the @GOP is Complicit & #Grassley #Graham Obstructing Justice
Your Letter & veiled Attacks on the @FBI McCabe & #TrumpRussia Investigations show USA the TRUTH

@GOP #TRAITORS put PARTY BEFORE COUNTRY
Senator @ChuchGrassley @LindseyGrahamSC
How Much Illegal Russian $$ did you take in Campaign Contributions ?
#USIC knows BOTH ARE COMPLICIT

Looks like these guys will be getting some kind of kick-back from Trump to help derail the investigation, You work for the AM people!
What a joke , stop trying to discredit the FBI investigation ! Does Watergate ring a bell
The Republic is burning and these GOP fools demand to know who dared to call the fire department.
Why would they give #FISA warrants to those trying to undermine investigation and may be subject of investigations?  That's why u want them.
Wow Trump now owns the GOP. No integrity, no independence, just loyalty to a lowlife who has & continues to defraud Americans. #MAGA
Your efforts to discredit the FBIs Russia probe are both unpatriotic & suspicious. What is the GOP afraid of. What are trying to hide?
How about asking if there were warrants when Obama had Intel spy on citizens, politicians and media? Ask Maxine Waters about O's database.
Trying hard to muck up investigation. So patriotic.
@ChuckGrassley @LindseyGrahamSC You need to stop it
@ChuckGrassley @LindseyGrahamSC what is your real intent? Seems as if you are impeding a process of inquiry

New: GOP operative sought Clinton emails from Russian hackers, implied he was working with Mike Flynn. https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-operative-sought-clinton-emails-from-hackers-implied-a-connection-to-flynn-1498770851 …
Bout damn time!
#demwits are in trouble now #RussianCollusion #fakenews
DO YOUR JOBS!!!!
Trying to quash investigations into Trump/Russia Collusion is obstruction of Justice at this point!! Don't be traitors!
@SenFeinstein 
@ChuckGrassley & Graham

Trying to undermine investigation into Trump/Russia. Now they've turned on the FBI. TO PROTECT TRUMP
They are trying to shut down investigation, why? The American people want the truth they need to butt out now.
Why? So you can protect the thief-in-charge? Everyday he's in power we are all at risk
Why are you asking for these? What is point of that if not to shuttle investigation?
I've noticed, as I'm sure others have, that Graham seems to be distancing himself from McCain.
Graham is worried they caught him doing something wrong
How about getting his Tax Returns @LindseyGrahamSC @ChuckGrassley. How about his many conflict of interest concerns!
@LindseyGrahamSC  Be careful what you wish for Mr. Graham, you might get more than you bargained for.
You want to concentrate on who found the crime .. not the crime .. meanwhile ...
Trying to figure out how to shut down Mueller investigation? What do they have on you?
Let's get the pee pee tape out! #donaldsgoldenshower
All these tactics to disrupt the investigation show exactly where Rep loyalty lies.  Disgustingly partisan and pro Trump.
you really like to be seen don't you Lindsey, too bad you don't have anything to say
Can you two pls explain why you're meddling in an ongoing FBI investigation? Obstructing justice is not acceptable.
@ChuckGrassley and @LindseyGrahamSC are actively committing the crime of obstruction of justice, in plain sight and they are proud of it!
Something big is going to come out soon. Trump freaking out.. now @LindseyGrahamSC trying to shut down the FBI investigation. Hurry Mueller!
Not falling for it! Do the right thing—put country before party. Let the investigation continue unimpeded & let chips fall where they may.
You retweeted this article thinking you'd be praised for your ruse, but we're not stupid. You're trying to discredit the investigation.
Why are you trying to shut the Russia investigation down. You an @ChuckGrassley think your slick. Your trying to stall the investigation
@LindseyGrahamSC is a traitor!! He better never run for Prez again. He's got dirty Russian skeletons in his closet.
Good luck trying to discredit FBI for doing its job you partisan hack. Someone needs to protect us from Russia, it's not you GOP commies.
Huh. Whatcha tryin' to do boys? Shut down Mueller's #TrumpRussia investigation? I'm guessin' y'all spell "patriot"...C*O*M*P*L*I*C*I*T.
Well, I can see you're both hip deep into trump's behind.
@LindseyGrahamSC & @ChuckGrassley are now trying to shut down #RussiaInvestigation by requesting these. Why? #Corruption #VoteThemOut
If the FBI is still investigating all of the Russia stuff why are you trying to interfere?  Wtf?
What is the kompromat on the two of you for your treason?  LOL the "deep state" will reveal the truth ... #TeamDeepState
Why is it a good idea to ask for evidence DURING an investigation? Senator Graham, I respect you but where's your integrity?
Are you trying to hinder the investigation? What is the point here? Why won't you put our country before your party? #Disgraceful
How is it possible for TWO Republicans to be leading an investigative chair?
Why are you retweeting "Washington Examiner" you snowflake. This is about protecting AMERICA not serving your boss.
@LindseyGrahamSC  and Grassley should be ASHAMED of themselves. Do not discredit or try to stop this investigation.
I'm sure your constituents voted for you to help protect this country--not to destroy law enforcement that you count on to keep you safe
Please don't hinder efforts in Congress to establish role of Russia in the 2016 election 
Shame on them. This investigation is on going. Misplaced priorities and pusedo patriotism. Trying to undermine the process in turn America
Big mistake Lindsay. You don't want to know about Trump/Russia right now, to early.
It seems that both Grassley & Graham are attempting to obstruct the FBI investigation on Trump/Russia collusion. Thought they were honest.
Why in the world are you disrupting an in progress investigation? I had thought you patriots and sane. Too much detail requested!WHY?
Lindseybwhat are u and Grassley up to? Sounds a little like YOU might be obstructing the investigation Dont do it- dont get thrown under bus
Wait until they're done with their investigation. Right now it looks as though you're trying to stop this investigation. Afraid of something
Two traitors
I'm sure we'll soon hear about the "grave reservations" and "serious concerns." Then they'll work to keep the useful fool in office.
Partisan action, I assume? Another distraction?
Probably.
#FISA #obama admin investigation stemming from Fake #dossier Better late than never.
If you could trust either men
Don't trust either as far as I can spit.
What is there to gain?
They Stop facts coming out, protect party,and Trump
Or sabotage the investigation..... 
I wonder if they are man enough to admit the truth....
It's about time!!!
Couldn't Don do this right now?
Well, at least Grassley did.
It's about time this request is made...should have been a year ago.
