Graham: I hope Trump will get his info & trust the American patriots who work in the Intel community, and not some guy hiding from the law 
.@LindseyGrahamSC 
#TraitorTrump is trying to cover his backside!

@Und81596229Miss
Thanks for RT the troll. Another blocked and out with the trash. Good work! :)
Oh no!!!! Don't block me! You can't handle the truth!
let's not forget who had an illegal server in her bathroom
Or was it in her basement? #OperationBasement
the bathroom in her basement?
Oh yes, probably so.
Gee maybe we should be looking more into the incriminating information in the emails rather than focus on the source.

@JulieMorr @NoiseCollector_ @LindseyGrahamSC @Newsweek whatever he needs to say. Keep him straight sen graham
@notrom76 Why does Trump defend Assange and Putin who want to dismantle the American democracy? Does Trump want this too?
@JulieMorr @LindseyGrahamSC @notrom76 they have something on him. Can't wait to see
neither are you
Why are you not mentioning the fact that the servers were never actually assessed by our Intel communities? That a 3rd party did them? FAKE
Graham "crackers" needs to retire yesterday!
@JasonLaCanfora @CNNSitRoom And you're no friend to America or SC, either, Linds! Go away.
Thank you sir for your good work on this topic!
GIVE IT UP already everybody knows youre a tool of the NWO
If he didn't blow the whistle on this, who would? Is America better for knowing the evil inner workings of campaigns? YES!!
You mean, @wikileaks is no friend to career politicians who don't want their cronyism exposed. http://www.freedomworks.org/content/top-10-absurd-quotes-lindsey-graham …
like Bengahzi??? like Iran??? like Obama?? come on American's R tired of the same things, & if Russia is bad why just now?
Good question.  Lindsay, Why did you meet with George Soros Nazi sympathizer?  The world wants to know!
@CNNSitRoom U.S. Intel > Assange
You hate Trump.  Anything that does not oppose him, you hate with all your butt hurt. WAH! HRC LOST! WAH!
Cont.
Not please excuse me while I go back to undermining our democratically elected president
@CNNSitRoom 
Graham is a fumbling idiot
Why are you against someone telling the truth? Or are you afraid he'll expose your email next time???
@CNNSitRoom This president-elect is frightening. There is something not right about him.  Surely you can see this?
But does he have a track record of lying like the "intelligence" community?
Speak for yourself!  Without @JulianAssange_  #America wouldn't have known the depth of @HillaryClinton & others corruption
@CNNSitRoom graham they got it wrong before. Don't bet on them getting it right or your loose your money.
the GOP is a cult of racists and kooks.
@CNNSitRoom senator graham when us his ties and interest going to be investigated.
@CNNSitRoom is that why Donna Brazile got fired?
Neither is the media or the current president. Or you establishment career politicians. That is why Trump is president.
@badgirl_loony That moment when I agree with Lindsey Graham
...it's an awkward and kinda painful experience, huh?
Yes. Much like it was with joe Walsh before he reverted to type
Indeed.
Thank you, Senator. Trump putting Russia over America is scary stuff. Please keep investigating Russian invasion.
PEOTUS supports Assange and Putin. Americans want to know why! Investigate Trump!
Investigate @LindseyGrahamSC closet...

Please look into Trumps involvement with JACOB ROTHSCHILD. He is believed to be #fundingHate & bought the election#TREASON
if he published false info sure. He hasnt. So he is undermining your lies. I see no issue. #NotToBeTrusted

Not a partisan issue!
Hiding from the law on false chgs and UN says his rights are totally being violated
@england498 @CNNSitRoom so does Obama, but occasionally even he told the truth
Assange has a record of 100% accuracy. Our MSM sure doesn't. If u were for the people u would praise his work
@Gabbiedrice78K 
Democrats will back truth tellers, not
#LiarInChief
@CNNSitRoom turns out Trump doesn't only produce fake news, he consumes it as well!
@AtomicElbow1 @CNNSitRoom uh nope.
@CNNSitRoom Don't count on it.
maybe the Intel community can be unpoliticized again.
@CNNSitRoom LIKE YOU LINDSEY YOU HAD NO CHANCE IN RUNNING AND NOW YOURE JEALOUS
Don't hold your breath Senator...Trump thrives on stolen info and giving out private cell numbers.
@CNNSitRoom So why is our president-elect coming dangerously close to treasonous behavior by cuddling w/Assange/Putin?
@CNNSitRoom amen
So do you!! Start acting like a republican instead of a Soros soldier @realDonaldTrump
@CNNSitRoom Congress declares election invalid, select 2 new candidates & let House choose!Talk to Ryan.  We cannot risk it
@deejay90192 @CNNSitRoom Thks 4 honestly Lindsay. Trump is siding w an enemy of the USA in Putin & Russia. Must investigate
@CNNSitRoom What we have here, sir, is a traitor. Your party will never recover from Trump. #StopTrump

http://gotnews.com/breaking-senjohnmccain-lindseygrahamsc-blocked-realdonaldtrumps-1st-dhs-pick-kriskobach1787-amnesty/ …
@CNNSitRoom If the MSM truly did their job & monitored gov't rather than colluding with them, We would not need Assange.
I will never forget the loyalty you have shown in a time when so many Americans are abandoning their duty to the flag.
A long time ago I took the oath of service. I never thought I'd live to see days like these. Enemies inside the gate.
@YouCowardlyLion @CNNSitRoom  Stay strong.
.@LindseyGrahamSC most of your fellow Republicans think that Assange is a hero and Putin is their friend
@CNNSitRoom with your pro war propaganda we know what side you are on
@CNNSitRoom dear mr graham we know the truth the cabal is getting arrested
please RESIGN or your MKULTRA victims will betray you. @CNNSitRoom
US has been corrupt for 30 yrs. About time this crap ends! You're part of the problem!
@CNNSitRoom Thank you for sticking up for America
@hoyawolf @CNNSitRoom funny he was everyone's hero when he was reporting against the Bush Administration
Not mine @Jeffrey_PHR @LindseyGrahamSC @CNNSitRoom
DO NOT sweep this under the rug.  Putin and Trump need to be investigate fully this is an ATTACK AGAINST AMERICAN!
@CNNSitRoom says the man who associates with terrorists...
He's no friend of the new left or the neo-cons, which makes him a friend of American and Americans.
Yeah. Exposing the old boys club. Detrimental to America. No. You, sir, are detrimental to America.
@CNNSitRoom Not a regular supporter but I respect you standing up for our country on this issue despite others looking away
@emigre80 @CNNSitRoom And yet Trump quotes him verbatim. What do they have on Trump?
what do you have to hide?
But he IS a friend of Trump.  Trump, like Assange, pisses on America daily.
Horseshit.
Neither are your traitorous republican pals.
.@LindseyGrahamSC @CNNSitRoom Politicians have a record of undermining the United States. What are in your emails Linds? Hmmm?
Trump is no friend either. I cannot find many admitting to have voted for him.
.@LindseyGrahamSC @mvanvol_van @CNNSitRoom @realDonaldTrump will also pardon his comrade @Snowden. Traitors enjoy company.
@CNNSitRoom like u do to US foreign policy?
dont let up lindsey, i have faith, dont let us down.
Neither is Soros but he's still walking around free as a bird.
@JeremyDeeSelden @CNNSitRoom Whatever, thought you were going to DO SOMETHING..can't trust Repubs...
Assange is whistle blower and exposes government corruption. When will politicians start arresting themselves?
You've been an incredible and brave voice, thank you for thinking rationally on things like this.
@CNNSitRoom he also assaults the underage. Sex charges in Sweden, assaunge can't go home!
You are wrong. Assange is an American hero #BLMKidnapping
@CNNSitRoom War Hawk. What ever Lindsey says do the opposite
Gather that you and #GOP buddy @SenJohnMcCain are backing off your #RussianHacking investigation #ShamelessSelfPromo!
@AndreaChalupa @CNNSitRoom Assange is thorough in his facts. Zero bad reports from @wikileaks. Can you say the same?
You've had it in for the POTUS elect since he gave out your flip phone number.
@CNNSitRoom Thank you Sen Graham, you and McCain only Repubs in DC with balls these days.
Trump is openly giving aid & comfort to a foreign intelligence agency & a cybercriminal. Isn't this what treason is?
@CNNSitRoom 
You Lindsey Graham are the one who is no friend to America or WeThePeople.Quit!
#LindseyGrahamIsTheProblem
@Evan_McMullin Thank you
@CNNSitRoom - And you're a RINO. So what should real Republicans do about YOU.

Breaking: Trump is working with advisers on a plan that would restructure and pare back the top U.S. spy agency http://on.wsj.com/2ic98iY 
My grandfather, father & uncle (military vets) are rolling over in their graves.
@CNNSitRoom doesn't even matter if it was Russia (I doubt it) fact remains Assange revealed truth!
You're a good man.  How can you support this madman of a President-elect? Please protect the American people.

what have you done to protect us? At least @wikileaks gave the Republic facts about @HillaryClinton and @Dnc ...
@CNNSitRoom - the same intel community that led us to believe Iraq had WMD's? Your credibility hits a new low stating this!

@CNNSitRoom neither are you or CNN! Libtards!
Ashamed I once voted for you. You believe US voters don't deserve the truth;  prefer pulling wool over our eyes.
undermining the U.S.? How, by supplying voters with factual information?
@MariaLiaCalvo @CNNSitRoom just become a democrat.
when our government puts disclaimers on their findings it means it's made up BS!
@GetBZLiving @CNNSitRoom Mr Graham I always thought you were a gentleman not a cracker.

@CNNSitRoom you, of all people would be well versed in undermining the United States for personal gain...WikiLeaks..read it
@CNNSitRoom tell the head of your party, not us
your intelligence agencies have been wrong intentionally and unintentionally many times. WikiLeaks hasn't lied once...

@CNNSitRoom you sir have the same record when it comes to having the American people's best interest... pathetic
you should be more concerned about what's in the email than who released them.
your a senator and you don't know he isn't in that embassy?  Lol
@CNNSitRoom Assange has never been wrong, why would he lie?  And you believe Obama?  Use your ACA, get your head examined!
