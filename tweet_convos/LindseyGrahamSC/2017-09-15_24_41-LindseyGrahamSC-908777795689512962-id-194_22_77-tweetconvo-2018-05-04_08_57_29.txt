#Obamacare is failing. #GrahamCassidy returns control to states and empowers them to innovate and stabilize costs.
Slimy Lindsey says this is good for Americans. Which ones?

This from May 6 is an infuriating artifact: both Cassidy and Graham criticizing House for EXACT thing they are doing https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/05/06/does-it-pass-the-jimmy-kimmel-test-asks-senator-who-authored-proposal-to-replace-obamacare/?utm_term=.a71d3db5362e …
this is a great solution

We will defeat you.

@LindseyGrahamSC is showing he is advocate of hate by using Breitbart for his message
I do not support this.   This will do more harm than good.
It's a death sentence, and you know it.
Yeah empowers them to steal the money moron
Mitch McConnell said you were moving on from  healthcare. Please do.
Why do you hate people having health insurance, @LindseyGrahamSC ?
Why would you put all your trust in Washington and not in your own local state to provide?
Lindsey, you have so much potential, but you fall short of John McCain. REGULAR ORDER MUST BE INVOKED WHEN VOTING ON LEGISLATION THIS BIG!!
Are you afraid of letting us the havenots have some form of healthcare.  Are you just bent on reversing what a black man accomplished?
Support? From whom? Your rich donors including the insurance and pharmaceutical industries? @WSJ @ProPublica @BBC @AP
Why are working so closely with Putin and Trump to take away healthcare?

Shame on you for your efforts to put healthcare out of reach for so many people and for your complicity in ensuring the ACA fails.
Support?  All I see is the total opposite, and rightly so.
Is being poor a preexisting condition? Most of the big boy countries have health care for their people why can't we?
Besides the 1%, who is supporting the Graham-Cassidy bill?
I do NOT support your pathetic and dangerous bill. USA deserves so much better. Trump/GOP = embarrassment.
Lindsey Graham is working as hard as he can to take away medicine from those who need it most.

I agree with my friend @SenJohnMcCain: a sustainable solution to healthcare requires a bipartisan solution & regular order. 
Extremely disappointing Senator Graham.  Special interests have you in their pocket, too.  Sad day for working families.
Party over America.

Hey @LindseyGrahamSC How could you listen to my concerns for my child's life & then propose a #healthcarebill that could kill her? 
Full repeal.. that is what you promised
Thanks for taking insurance away from millions and making women's healthcare non existent.  This is the worst of the worst.
Bully hockey.
@GOPLeader plan is a farce. People are not as ignorant as you believe. Repubs know nothing of healthcare. Repubs no leaders
Damn, man.  LET IT GO.
@LindseyGrahamSC of your quarter-million Twitter followers, exactly 69 have expressed support, or " momentum" for this Tweet. Get it??

You are kicking ACA in the ass out of partisan hatred. DO NOT INSULT AMERICA"S INTELLIGENCE AGAIN? MItch played that card already! ACA's LAW

Nope!
You don't have mine.
It is obvoius that you  are choosing to ignore wht the American prople want- and the only way u r going to listen is by being relepced. -ok!
Why do you hate women, children, the poor, and elderly?
Um about 65 million + don't support this. #cruel
this is why people think gop are evil trolls.  #repealandgofuckyourself 
Just a little tip. If you have a good idea, don't steer your pitch w/ the failed "repeal and replace" line. Open better.
You are causing it to fail by failure to do your job and do nothing as usual. Just say no is not governing it's lazy republicans BS
I do not support this bill at all.  Please get over what you think you promised and start listening to what people want and need.
Only failing because you are sabotaging it
When you hear Republican say the word EMPOWER..it means get lots of Vaseline...Sen Graham
Affordable Care Act is failing only because Republicans have piddled around & have scared insurance companies. Jesus, DO SOMETHING useful.
NO NONONONONONONONONONONOOH!!! CALL YOUR REPS EVERYONE. CRUSH THIS NASTY EVIL CRUEL BILL.
"Momentum" based on false information.  How about asking @POTUS to support the existing law and make sure people know how to enroll?
I don't support this horrible healthcare plan!! Stop ur BS and fix ACA!!! 
In your own mind, maybe it's building. #Medicare4All
Grow a pair. Sorry not sorry your plan sucks. I would respect you more if you came out. Being gay isn't a crime, even in SC. We got you!!
Might work if SC weren't governed by idiots who just lost billions on utility projects, mismanaged state pensions, and refunded higher ed.
let States decide abt Health Care, Abortions, Segreation, Racial intermarriage, Equal Marriage Laws. Yeah, do that & watch country dissolve
U know damn well there r States that will NEVER support Health Care 4 US Citizens. People will die, expecially n South. I know. I live here.
Senator Graham, why don't u just add another ammendment that States have full power and control over discrimination, Equal Rights laws, etc?
South Carolina will not pave the roads.  No thank you when I need bypass surgery.
You do NOT have my support nor the support of other SC constituents I know
@LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy You people just don't get it.  Your propaganda against ACA has been unmasked. People have changed their minds!
I think it's DOA.  I know you tried but there's just too many things WRONG about #GCHJ ... It's a death knell
More bullshit
Go figure, If you starve a child because it's not yours it starts to fail....
if it wasn't mandatory, how many people would drop their Obamacare plan?
Just what the American People deserve to be tossed off of Medical because of worthless republicans on the hill
You're actually stealing money from states who enacted the ACA to give it to states that didn't? - what happened to personal responsibility?
NOOOOO
And btw, you have no support.
That's too bad lyndsey..SC can't afford it.
Please wait for the CBO report. How many will have to give up their peace of mind?
Support from whom? Big Pharma? Lobbyists? Not constituents or MAJORITY of Americans. PED will lose coverage. Kids will lose coverage.
Confidentially Senetor; you don't have my support. You've got alot of EXPLAINING and PROVING to do before you get MOST people's support
That's not momentum you feel, sir.   You are striking fear and disgust in others.
Stop it, LG. You know better.
@GOPLeader

Your #KillerBill will kill more Americans each year than 9-11. What does that make YOU?!?
Senator Graham, You're a good guy in so many ways, but this is cruel and heartless.
Hey McCarthy your in the House right
Who cares what he thinks he is in the House another village idiot
Fix the ACA.  Better yet, Medicare from birth to death.  Republicans better listen because 2018 is coming!  No tax cuts for the wealthy.
These folks & those who love them will remember at the polls.
2018 can't come fast enough.
Shame on you, @LindseyGrahamSC. Notice how little love your #GrahamCassidy posts get? Stop it. You're better than this. Much.
Your bill takes healthcare from those poor & with serious mental illnesses currently covered. You saw the numbers protesting the last time.
No. Block grants seriously limit the state's ability to provide assistance for the many who need it. & many who have healthcare will lose it
Unless you live in a state like Illinois.
Better not take away insurance from anyone.
If it fails it's on your ass.  You have wanted it to fail from the beginning. It's a law so it is your responsibility to make it work.
Have you talked to your SC offices? They have been busy taking calls from those who do NOT support this bill.
@GOPLeader If the Fed govt can't stabilize costs how do you expect states to?
*please clap*
This attempt to repeal ACA will be as successful as the last 60+ attempts. Or as convincing as Graham playing heterosexual.
State control is what hurt SC to begin with, never participated in expansion.
No. We need healthcare for all.
Shame on you, Lindsey.  I'm a constituent and I'm ashamed of you;you do NOT represent me, my friends, or family.

#GrahamCassidy would price gouge older Americans with an age tax, decrease coverage, and undermine pre-existing condition protections.
No monentum here gurl! Get ur head out of ur ass and do something worthwhile
I tweeted Graham and let him know his plan stinks who will join me?
Ugh 
Obama care is only going to fail because you GOP are killing it. Fix it, don't try to kill us with this bill that will only take away care
Don't count your chickens linds
McCarthy & Graham are failing. Bad bill.
Shameful. Your bill would lead to needless suffering and deaths by depriving children & less fortunate of healthcare coverage.
It stills takes healthcare from millions and effects preexisting conditions.When are u going to understand we all want affordable healthcare
Do you ever listen to your constituents at all?? I can't wait to vote you out of office
You andMcCarty are lying..again. Plan leaves millions once again the most vulnerable facing no insurance and has little support ...Sad
McCarthy - there's a call for the Benghazi committee ya better get a move on
If you're going to tweet re healthcare, have the courtesy to listen to us. Vast majority of Americans are vehemently opposed to your plan.
no it isn't and no it doesn't
Seriously!? You still want to take Healthcare away from us? You need need to far far away #Resist #ACA
"Momentum continuing to build"? Lindsey, you're drinking sweet tea loaded with hallucinogens! Bless your heart--read the Twitter comments!!
Sounds like a terrible idea to me.

Make me puke!
Go get'em Lindsay!!! MAGA
BOO !!!! Fix the ACA.  It is incredibly unchristian to throw millions off healthcare! NO!
Can't say I'm thrilled about your unconstitutional attempt to strip citizenship away from people w/o a trial.
This is tantamount to laughing at your own joke! When McCain, Murkoski, and Collins congratulate you...
Where is your bills score, Lindsey?  How many wo health care?
Momentum downhill and out, I hope.
Awesome. A shit state like sc will have people dying or relocating to northeast and cali.  See education for  example. Red states way behind
Doesn't support coverage guarantee for preexisting conditions -- why should we go 'backwards' in our healthcare? Seems bad.
Do you think you can get your buddy to vote yes this time. He sunk the last one !!! Embarrassing if he votes no @SenJohnMcCain
Improve the ACA. GrahamCassidy is a disaster.
New bill keeps most of mean aspects of rejected bill with revisions.Blk grnt 4 9 yrs then no funding after 2027.U don't 1t ppl 2 have ins ic
Repair the ACA!!!
Please stop trying to ruin my family's future
It's a terrible plan, please drop it Graham
Thought u were better than this.. guess not.
Bernie sanders has great idea for health cover which works in Australia,England,Israel,Switzerland,Norway, Sweden ....
As your President likes to say: WRONG! We don't want repeal. We want a bipartisan agreement on the markets.
This is why GOP has delivered the Trump disaster. Refusal to work on bipartisan legislation & entrenched hatred of Dems. Country suffers
One of the reasons why SC doesn't get the full benefit of Obamacare is because states were given some control, and the @GOP crippled it here
True for many states. A result of @scotus decision.  Our @gop can fix Obamacare - they simply must as this bill isn't a solution.

No #GCHJ
Lindsay what would your buddy McCain want? Imagine him going through chemo/ radiation without insurance? Come out & wake up
@GOPLeader So far your plan seems to be leading to rationed state health care plan not good for anyone!
ACA is failing b/c @GOP is sabotaging it. Your bill's just as bad
FIX IT!  Don't destroy it, my son depends on it!
Seriously how do you guys sleep at night?
You will be remembered as a Senator who was complicit. I thought you were a different GOP. #disappointed
I'm a South Carolina voter and you do NOT have my support. Your bill is a cruel disaster Stick to pimping for the Defense Industry.
@GOPLeader - Graham is a flip-flopper
#GrahamCassidt: because why shouldn't where you live determine whether you get healthcare or not?
Thanks Reps for making ACA fail so that u can put in a plan w significantly less benefits. Hope you're proud
is momentum building for the fact that insurers can charge higher premiums for pre-existing conditions? Didn't think so.

Stop torturing me and my family by trying to take our healthcare away. Damn you!
Innovate? Or create fake insurance that doesnt cover #preexisting  or ban #lifetimecaps ? The #ACA saved my son's life! #braincancer
Thanks for sharing this. So glad the #ACA helped your son as it helps millions each day. 

We can fix Obamacare - we must. 
NO #GCHJ @hop
Who's supporting this??
Lets get a full repeal
It's a horrible plan!  Do you care about your constituents at all???
Only the republican constituents.
Even most Republicans think this is not good.  No one wants to lose coverage.
Yes, millions of Americans earlier this year filled town halls, made trips to Wash DC, called & wrote to say: FIX OBAMACARE.Do it!

NO #GCHJ
Get it done @LindseyGrahamSC America is counting on you!
I do not support ANY of this.
According to an @FoxNews poll, 96% of FNC viewers think congress, over herpes & traffic jams, is making their lives more miserable. #FBR
You really need to read what @RandPaul said about this Bill and listen to him
You are destroying families across America. Your family must be SO proud you.
You do that.Steal HealthCare,ruin/end lives. Pass it at all costs. Don't be shocked when we get our opportunity, politically. SINGLE PAYER

I do not support defunding #plannedparenthood, allowing states to charge more for #preexistingconditions, or defunding MeduCaid. #SaveACA
Not really, but keep trying, Plucky.
Members of Congress I really hope something works...these rate hikes are causing people to choose between health insurance, investing , etc
This as usual will NOT work
Nobody's Rt you. Not feeling the love

You people are the sort of men history is going to call cruel, corrupt and craven. Bank on it.
Why not fund Obamacare and implement in all 50 states? 8 years Republicans didn't come up with their own bill, just whining. Shame on you!
The majority of Americans will make life a living hell for you and the rest of the Republicans if you try this.
#HashtagFail
Congrats on finding the voter who supports your bill!
