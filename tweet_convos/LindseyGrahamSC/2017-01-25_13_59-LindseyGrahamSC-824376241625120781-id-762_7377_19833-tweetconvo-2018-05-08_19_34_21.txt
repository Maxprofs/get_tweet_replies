Lindsey Graham Cowers Behind Tree Trunk As Trump’s Hunting Dogs Close In http://trib.al/vkZyYYt  
We stand with you.
is quickly rising on my list of 10 people living & dead with whom I'd love to dine...post his Senate retirement. #GetAlong
Hey buddy, @TheOnion is satire. Not real news. 
The Onion is not mainstream media. It's parody. But we are all fearful of Bannon's Goebbel style propaganda.
@jvwhitfield @TheOnion Dogs have the scent of a decenter. Lock him UP!
At least u can still laugh.PLS gather other reas.Repubs(McCain, Flake, Collins, Murkowski,etc)& stop this madness
thank God someone still has a sense of humor.
I'd be more entertained if you'd voted against his traitorous nominees. Used to respect you.
Oh my gosh, you are my hero!  Please save us.
good one but is reminiscent of a slave. I HOPE he doesn't OWN YOU!  Stop him NOW he IS A FRAUD AND SICK HEAD
Funny! But seriously, you've overseen getting us where we are with no solutions until Trump comes along. BEGONE!
We differ on some issues but I respect your humor & speaking out against bad policy. #stoppresidentbannon @realdonaldtrump
You know Lindsey, u remind me of the way politics were when we were kids: party didn't matter, the PERSON did. I LIKE you!
love your sense of humor, senator. Wish POTUS could take a joke so well.
Looking forward to SC 2020 GOP primary.
you can start impeachment proceedings at any time. How about now?
the "Democra-torus" Dinosaurs  have just met their meteor. No one listening, no one cares for the next 8 yrs
what about the majority of Americans who did not vote for the orange lunatic?
you're going to have to suck it up snowflake just like I did with Obama.
Another stooge new to Twitter. Gullible or paid?
no hope for you guys, have fun drinking your own battery acid for the next 8 years
thank you for standing against him by confirming all cabinet picks! true GOP spirit - 2-faced
@NickKristof besides being willing to disagree esident, @LindseyGrahamSC has a sense of humor. In GOP ranks, #Boffo!
Please, for the sake of our Union, put your vote where your mouth is. No on DeVoss. No on Sessions. No on Tillerson.
registered DEM here. Sir, I have never had more respect for you than I have this last year. Keep calling him out!
Me too - and I vote in South Carolina.  If you keep it up, you'll have my vote next time.
I hope the "I won’t go down w/out a fight" quote is not the #alternativefacts please join the Americans and #resist trump
Senator, I don't agree with you on most things, but honorable GOP pols are our only hope right now. #StandAndFight
Republicans can be funny?
They're coming with term limits... help, my  the gravy train is over...#draintheswamp
would you mind rallying a few moderates to prevent him from destroying everything? Pretty please? KTHXBAI.
He isn't a moderate, check his voting record.
Stay strong Senator Graham!
You can come stay with me in Seneca.  I'll protect you.  I'll snatch that Cheeto bald & send his dogs howling.
amazing !!
@SOFFru1 @TheOnion Then stop Sessions, you know the intel, you know his links at Alfa/Page
That's hilarious. Now please don't vote for Tillerson. Be on the right side of history.  Be a hero.
I KNOW u don't like "Butt Cheetoh"; my daughter's term, but I like it, make sure History shows that in ur actions
Good for you, @LindseyGrahamSC ! 
I vote in SC and am asking u to oppose racist Jeff Sessions for Attorney General.
Hiding behind a tree isn't fighting.

The more President Trump succeeds the less credible ppl like u become.
In #alt-reality where you stand up against the moral crime that is the executive order re: refugees? #makeamericahateagain
This makes me like you even more. Save us sir!
Donald Trump is dangerous but may actuality unite pubs and dems as we fight for our Constitution and against HIM
.@LindseyGrahamSC That is clearly a live oak in the picture, not a willow tree as  @TheOnion claims.
There will be stuff I don't like because I am a D and stuff I don't like because they are plain bad actions 2/2.
R's like you can help D's like me distinguish between "conservative" Trump actions and incompetent crackpot actions. 1/2
#BeABetterConservative Fight the good fight Sen. Graham
LOL This is funny. Full props. But don't distract us from the disaster unfolding in the White House.
Quality journalism. Funny when they accidentally get it right. #notareaganrepublican   #atleastwehavetimscott
for some reason I doubt #minoritypresident would take a joke like you do.
hahahaaa #AlternativeFacts
That's cute. How about you make sure my son with a heart defect can still get health care though. @LindseyGrahamSC @TheOnion
Be careful of your phone, they get expensive!
Your Republican Party invented 'alternative facts'
you're a republican I might be able to get behind!
When are you going to IMPEACH him??? Start NOW
You willing to fight for all of US?Potus is a MadMan. Love your attitude but need your actual support to save US.
@kristiholmes @TheOnion Well done, sir. Well done.
you rock!
I think I am falling in love...
We got your back, Lindsey!
I'm beginning to like you Senator.
as a Democrat I'm your fan. Thanks for being balanced in times of so much division.
you just may be the coolest (and most reasonable) GOP yet!
you set impossible standards for the rest of the Lindsey's out there Senator Graham, 
we are not worthy. #Yoda #MiyagiMe 
You are gonna be primaried out next run..
while this is funny ur still unqualified for ur job and I wish my tax money was going toward education inst of u
.@LindseyGrahamSC @TheOnion You are my new hero, senator. The country is counting on you. Save us, please, from this madman.
Please stand up to this authoritarian. Fight for democracy. Fight for the constitution.
Had to laugh at this one
Good humor sir!
Anyone else kind of blown away that Lindsey Graham may become one of the saviors of the fucking country?
Wish you actually would fight him..
I'm a nutty left wing Bernie fan, but I think I may love you now. 
Did you hear the banjos dueling?  Stay ahead of those dogs!  We're praying for you.
this truly made my day. And yet, it also made me worry…
God bless ya, Senator.
this is the best thing I've seen all week. Screw SNL, I'm just going to read Lindsey Graham tweets all week.
@wcsanders @TheOnion I'm not a conservative but I respect you for fighting Trump. Russia owns us. Please stop him.
I don't agree with your politics but I've always appreciated your sense of humor.
lol. You're a clown. Glad to see your sense of humor and sensible voice in an ocean of crazy.
https://youtu.be/RXSFRMJhlgY  Still share this often. 
remeber the time you voted for tillerson? Thanks a lot.
Please saddle up your posse and impeach this clown @LindseyGrahamSC @TheOnion
Don't make me grudgingly think you might be sort of OK Senator.
@EricaGrieder this reminds me that I'm tired of McCain/Graham getting more moderate cred than actual moderate SusanCollins.
thank you senator for your sense of humor and level head.
@PantsuitPolitic God Senator Graham's got some good PR people
I love that you have a sense of humor!
do your job and protect the country from an unqualified madman.
Lindsey, you are quickly becoming my favorite Republican. #ITMFA
I don't agree with a lot of your political beliefs, but I sure do appreciate your humor! 
@EricaGrieder @TheOnion That's from his latest Vogue photoshoot; instructions were to brood while clutching tree trunk.
Oh shot, the Ecuador thing... fuck that's funny
Senator Graham, thank you for standing up for REAL American values!  #NoFascistUsa
I promise,I will vote republican at some point in the future(have only voted GOP once so far)if you will help!
Luv ur sense of humor.
Thank the good Lord for Republicans like you! Our country needs you right now!
@realDonaldTrump is now being trolled by republican colleagues, goodbye don cause no one is taking you seriously
You go Lindsay!!!
Haha. Great to see your sense of humor.
I hit you hard on many things but this is a complete win!
@AndyRichter @TheOnion
Can this @hugepieceofshit  get more followers than @realDonaldTrump 
You have certainly redeemed yourself in my eyes Senator Graham.  You are the voice of reason.  Keep it up!
even though I'm a Dem through and through I like you
Well played sir! Although I am a raging liberal, I admire your style!
Dude, @TheOnion is SATIRE.  Look it up in a dictionary or something
I can't believe I am sharing a tweet from a Republican... snowballs in hell!
Keep up the sense of humour Lindsey. Both sides of the aisle and the border r with you

@vickscan @TheOnion You can join Assange in London.  Roommates?  LOL..

PS, Glad you have sense of humor!
You and @SenJohnMcCain need to do a buddy movie. Please get us out of this nightmare. We hate @VP but he's not insane, just mean as hell.
This is A+ Twitter. Wish more folks fought for what's right instead of what's right for the party.
exactly! It's what I'm trying to spread w the philosophy of #utilitarianism  in public policy
Senator Graham, are there enough pragmatic members of the Senate to stop the Trump train careening down the tracks?
too bad you're not as clever as your minion tweeter.
well played, Senator. @TheOnion, careful. Some people are out there comparing you to @CNN. Sorta. Indirectly.
Всі ці заможні республіканці будуть сховавшись за чимось, коли вони падають зрадник Bastards
Tous ces républicains riches seront cowering derrière quelque chose quand ils tombent les traîtres de traître
so refreshing - especially these days - to see a #politician able to laugh at himself. #respect
Don't you even think about it. Get your ass back here. Visual the action, then actualize the vision. The cue ball is Trump's left nut.
trump has to be a gold mine for the Onion.  Ad revenues going to the moon.  Record!

Appreciate you having a sense of humor about it all.
Why Sen Graham, I declare, you do have a sense of humor. (said in my best southern accent) @WordKitchenDC @TheOnion
who knew @LindseyGrahamSC @TheOnion

I'm a Dem, though I will stand up for you, don't  fold! Don't let them ruin the U.S.
I know it's the end of the world because lately I like Lindsey Graham and agree with half of what he says.
Look @LindseyGrahamSC I disagree with you on a number of issues, but gd you got jokes. #unlikelyheroes
that a boy! Lol
@AndyRichter @TheOnion country over party, sir. Get it together and stop this fascist puppet #removebannon #impeachtrump
@AndyRichter @TheOnion careful Senator, you'll end up in a camp with us.
@AndyRichter @TheOnion Aunt Lindsey got into the cooking sherry again...
Story is more factual than half of your BS over the past 8 years.  Go Away. (Directed at Graham.. not The Onion)
Show some backbone on Tillerson, Pruitt & Sessions and EPA censoring and we’ll send in a rescue crew.
@doorsixteen what is happening
Suddenly Lindsay Graham looks like an extreme left wing liberal compared to Agent Orange?
it’s insane.
Technically, I think that's #satire. Still clever and I respect your having fun with it.
Godspeed Senator! @LindseyGrahamSC @AndyRichter @TheOnion
@AndyRichter @TheOnion lmaoo I like where you're going here but they're friends of putin so mexico is your safest bet
Finally a sane Republican I can support. Keep up the fight even if the other spineless GOP won't. U have ethics
Don't go to Ecuador or Argentina.  All Bannon's Nazi buddies have been hiding there since WWII.
Better stock up on tequila.
Honey, are you drunk tweeting us?
Seriously, we disagree on a lot but you seem like a good man. We are going to need you. Sanity seems to be at a premium
you're not my favoritebut please keep puttingheat on that impotent cheeto masquerading as our minority President
@AndyRichter @TheOnion As a SC resident I am happy you are fighting the good fight. Don't let our people struggle over 
Good to see Mr Graham has a sense of humor while Rome burns.
Not sure if more surprised that #tweetoftheyear happened in Jan, or that it was from @LindseyGrahamSC. Respect.
@AndyRichter @TheOnion HAHAHA HILARIOUS! Keep advancing his retrograde agenda, though. #resist #fuckyou
@AndyRichter @TheOnion We'll believe it when we see the votes on the bills
I wanna see you challenge Trump to a game of pool. https://youtu.be/_PtoJ6kKl1E 
@AndyRichter @TheOnion Linds,we really need 2 talk abt some things later,but if u can stop what is happening; cookie bouqet
 @LindseyGrahamSC @AndyRichter @TheOnion
@AndyRichter Please tell us you’re taking @SenJohnMcCain with you.
STOP TRYING TO TRICK ME INTO LIKING YOU ON TWITTER! I have enough problems to contend with as it is!
Omg, I keep agreeing with Lindsey Graham...
@kkjokhi
self deprecating humor props, sir
You're a good sport, senator. Thanks for being honest re some ofTrump's more insane statements.
@ClaraJeffery @TheOnion Come on down to Ecuador! I immigrated down here in October and love it! 
@ClaraJeffery @TheOnion Sir if you exhibit this sense of humor in the primary, you would have won.
You're the poster boy for #TermLimits. Have a nice day! 
lol Mr. Graham, you just might be alright #DidntVote4you
If you'd like to go to Ecuador, I will happily pay your airfare. #MAGA #HesMyPresident @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
Send @LindseyGrahamSC to Ecuador could be the most supported Go Fund Me page in history
@ChazPolizzi
@ClaraJeffery wonder what gop rural america base feels about all those exec orders, none of which aimed at benifiting them
changing parties crossed your mind?  You'd be much more comfortable & we have a great book club. We're all reading 1984.
@ClaraJeffery @TheOnion Love a senator with a sense of humor
@ClaraJeffery @TheOnion Did someone let the senator open the good bourbon today?
ok that line about Ecuador is pretty good
if you can't cry, might as well laugh.
THIS is how a politician is supposed to respond to being the butt of a joke
hysterical!
That's it.  This world has gone completely wacky.  I can no longer tell which way is up.
Funny but it covers a sad reality. For all your talk, you haven't done jack shit to back up your words.
@lovepeoplejo @TheOnion Good sense of humor!!!!
Little do they know you kiss his ass just like the others. Smack.
Omg  Sir, you help protect us, we protect you… that's how this works. Fight on!
damn who knew Lindsey (or anyone who worked for him) had a sense of humor!  Don't make me start liking repubs! 
so satire is "alternative fact"?  You're a tool
Don't go, Senator, but find ways to stop the insanity of this new president who thinks in only 5 days that he is "Emperor".
...Where has this Lindsey Graham been?
Really? Meanwhile, #Trump plans to wall in all Americans!  P.S. Canada is easier and quicker. 
gotta say that's funny... you gots jokes...
Glad you took of your skirt and put on your camos. I disagree with most all of your views, but you r a fighter!
Glad to know you're safe Senator. We have big political differences, but I'd enjoy a marg & guac with you! :-)
You are too funny. This was not so. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/business/media/stephen-bannon-trump-news-media.html …
I applaud your sense of humor today..this and the mexico boozee tweet !  lol
LMBO!
Madre mio! -- a Republican with a sense of humor!
appreciate this. Country before party senator. Please
@Intrigue_Jones
Sir, we may disagree on a number of political points but kudos on standing up to Mr Trump.
I'm delighted when you stand up to these dark forces in GOP, but seems like you always fall in line eventually. 
And not just you. Any Republican who pushes back (like Rubio recently), you guys always go with GOP in the end.
I must admit, you have a sense of humor
Hey Linds, are you drinking your stockpile of tequila before Trump takes it away? Your tweets are on 
Senator @LindseyGrahamSC understands how to deal with the media. (social &legacy)  Lots of politicians could learn from him and @nikkihaley
Mainstream media misses scoop of the year - @TheOnion nails it. I won’t go down w/out a fight. Seeking Asylum in Ecuador. #alternativefacts https://twitter.com/TheOnion/status/824366012967567360 …
