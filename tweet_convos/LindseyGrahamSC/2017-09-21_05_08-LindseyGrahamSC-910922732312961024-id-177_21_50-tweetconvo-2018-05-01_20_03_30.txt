GOP healthcare plan covers little & will hurt US greatly. GOP has lost all ability to write good bills. @VP would never enroll in GOP plan.

Graham Trump and the GOP have been lying to you about HC for years.


the enemy of the people AKA the media was silent over what obooba did, WOW
Healthcare is a right, not a privilege. Enough said...
LOL the loony left, now run 2 your safe space LOL so you like what that a-hole o-boob-a did? sad
ROFLMAO! Pence opens mouth and inserts foot! He hasn't got a clue and we all know it!
Graham-Cassidy is a death sentence for many - after it robs them with surcharges.
.@VP is almost as bad as @realDonaldTrump, but not quite as narcisstic and out of touch. Do u people READ anything???
When his lips are moving, he is lying.

@SenJohnMcCain you are being used by your BFF.
He looks like a big ass bottle of ketchup.

Lindsay and the GOP have been flat out lying to you about healthcare for 8 years. Flat out lying
Pence is a liar. As we have all learned by now.
The overwhelming majority of this country is against this. You're repugnant liars. This is about #KochBrothers money & your hate for obama
A healthy electorate can support a healthy economy. A sick one cannot. Vote no to the GOP rollback of benefits to deserving Americans.
Mother whips @mike_pence every night.
AND MISQUOTED THOMAS JEFFERSON ABOUT STATE HLTHCARE VS FEDERAL 
WHAT A STUPID MAN 

And all these organizations hate you Graham – Cassidy!
Add AMA, AARP, AHIP, and BCBS to these, too . . .
Oh DID he? Did he discuss all of the lies & bull?  

Vote No on #GrahamCassidyDeathBill #resist #GrahamCassidyBill @GOP #SaveACA #obamacare
@mike_pence if you support the CASSIDY Graham Bill then that proves you are no real Christian.  Jesus would not support such a cruel bill

If Canada's HC system is so bad, wby do American corporations and exec prefer it to ours Lindsay? Answer please?

Lindsay is lying to you all.
Maybe the Vice President can be a proud participant on one of the Republican's State run Death Panels
He's certainly a man of theatrics. Perfected the deep sighs. Pissy looking eyes. Grave facial expressions. All BS.
Who cares what this Trump behind kisser has to say? Pence is guilty too of lying for Trump-When Trump goes so should Pence

Obamacare is failing because of GOP backdoor deals with @mtbert to trade ACA market collapse for anti-competitive mergers. https://twitter.com/SenateMajLdr/status/910569501921443840 …
http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/entire-health-care-industry-fights-kill-republican-repeal-bill?cid=sm_fb_maddow …   Entire health care industry fights to kill GOP repeal bill. So why is  the GOP pushing this travesty on us?
Big pharmaceutical. Big tax cut for the uber wealthy
How does it help those in need of Medicaid?  You are leaving it up to the insurance companies. Shame on you. I had thought better of you.

Oh Lindsay.. You're so transparent. Why would you screw over your own state? Follow the $$$...
Wonder no more. The Koch donor network will give GOP $400M for 2018 *only if ACA is repealed* & tax reform passes https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/26/koch-network-piggy-banks-closed-republicans-healthcare-tax-reform …
Jackass
Lies, lies, lies.
Christian?  Not even close.
#GCHJ must be good if the bribe to @lisamurkowski is to not have to participate in it.  Thanks for killing the bipartisan bill @GOP Morons.
The GOP doesn't care about working class people they just want to repeal so the Koch brothers will give them money. Greed is the MO of GOP!
Kimmel is correct.#congress lies https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/09/21/sen-cassidys-rebuttal-to-jimmy-kimmel-more-people-will-have-coverage/?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_factchecker-cassidy-335am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.59311771cf32 …  @vp
Bunch of old, wrinkled white men defending privileged white man shit.

Did the GOP meet w/doctors, nurses, patients, constituents to talk healthcare? No, but right after meeting their donors, we got this bill.
Once again claiming to go all over America talking to people... Journalists need to call him out on this.... he only goes to "safe" district
Compelled by the Koch-ie Monster. Americans want Obamacare. Stop talking about your lame campaign promise.
Could not even give a straight answer to Norah
.@VP @POTUS @LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @GOP have become a #CassidyGraham laughing stock!
They should all be ashamed of themselves.  They are trying to get their 0.1% donors tax cuts, not get their voters what they should have
Watch for the exclusions for members of congress so they get to keep the good healthcare!
Pence has a good Christian background to throw Americans off the health care bus just to get a win for his party...
Why Lindsey, now you wanna bribe Alaska to get them to through people off of health care so you can be big man to the Kochs-sad little man.
No money for healthcare, elderly, the poor but can find $700billion for military spending?Does it also mean planned parenthood is state run?
Graham-Cassidy promotes abortion by allowing insurers to charge a woman $17,000 more for insurance if she has completed a pregnancy.
#noGrahamCassidy
Single Payer healthcare for all in the richest country ever makes a lot more sense than anything....
@sengraham2016 @BillCassidy Saw interview.He"repeatedly" dodged Russian questions, pushing @GOP HORRIBLE healthcare. bill. Only reason there
Go ahead Lindsey, ignore the facts and give Donny his "win."
Healthcare for all not this. Read the bill, please. And stop calling it Obamacare when it's ACA.  Unless all you hate is @BarackObama

@mike_pence VP Mike Pence, up to his neck in RUSSIA. The pretend concerned face is losing it's effect.
Call your Senators!  This bill is bad for all of us!  They just want a win and don't care what it means to us.
@LindseyGrahamSC 
you are no Pres Reagan 
or Sen. Hollings! #GrammRudman cut troop size, didn't funnel $$ into it. #IServed #USAF #Veterans
Did you see how Pence changed the subject.  They cannot answer the pre-existing question.  States can price insurance out for most of us.
They should be discussing why the @VP knew that #flynn was an foreign agent and hired him anyway. This is an # impeachable offence #Mueller
Majority of Americans oppose this bill, virtually every medical organization is against it. @GOP puts party before country every time.
The President has made clear his position on protecting pre-existing conditions. Yes, protecting them so they don't get addressed
The @GOP will do anything to make sure the @Koch_Industries piggybank stays open & funnels money to their accounts.
giving power back to the states so the states can screw Americans.  How patriotic
These are the worst human beings to ever walk the planet.
That's all there is to it: repealing the ACA even if it un-insures millions & leaves the sick, poor & elderly vulnerable. Reprehensible.
If you really want the best for Americans...write a HC Bill that all of YOU want for YOURSELVES! Then use it like we do!
#liars
@LindseyGrahamSC, he's been caught lying in interviews before. This is not a big deal.
#GrahamCassidyBill Is a horrible bill. It eliminates protection for pre-existing conditions, essential services and lifetime caps
Liar!Christians don't lie. But I watched the lie come out of his mouth on the news. God don't like liars
Blue Cross is standing by, ready to reinstated pre-existing conditions exclusions. http://www.ilhealthagents.com/bluecross-blueshield-illinois/pre-existing-condition-exclusions/ …
Competition didn't help before. That's why Obama fought for universal healthcare. You need to start listening to the people.
Mike Pence is known liar.  https://youtu.be/Ihil3dMTAdQ 

State based innovation means each state decides on what to do about preexisting conditions. Pence is a liar for trying to guarantee it.
Hon. Graham, coverage useless if people can’t afford to buy it. Allowing states & insur cos to determine w/no regulations is disingenuous
Straight up lies and bullshit VP it's a good thing your not Pinocchio or your nose would be mile long. Not very christian to lie so easily.
I HOPE this backfires for you Sen Graham. Your too excited about hurting people and their health care

We find no evidence of the individual market collapsing. Rather, insurers on track to have best year since ACA began http://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/individual-insurance-market-performance-in-early-2017/ … 
His true politician side was showing. Awful

GrahamCassidy bill hurts Americans. Voting 4 this b/c u want a "win" is reprehensible! 80% of public oppose this bill. Put ppl b 4 party!
@GOP paid THIS senator off...
Did he mention that they need this bill in order to cut Medicaid enough to pay for tax cuts for America's richest? They are so dishonest....
Shame on you- lying racist greedy treasonous corrupt Koch brothers puppet. #SaveACA #nullify2016
Well, his lips were moving so there's that.

WOW. 

Please take 5 minutes & listen to @ElenaHung202 of @LittleLobbyists explain just how dangerous …
So why should we pay federal taxes if all responsibilities is on states?

I'm Jake, I was born with a birth defect, without ACA and Medicaid I hit my life time cap when I was 14 days old! Without ACA I will die! 
Then it was one damn short discussion, wasn't it? Dead air... Like #DeathCare.

#SaveACA it's better than DEAD.

1. If you get health insurance from your job, the Graham-Cassidy #Trumpcare bill puts you at risk.

Lets all listen to Pence, who says, "smoking is not a health risk" yeah that guy really knows what he is talking about..
This is the worst so called Healthcare bill yet

Check out @TheDailyShow’s Tweet:
“Let’s face it: America sucks at health care.”

http://on.cc.com/2yr5r1r  
Lindsey wake up. First of all nobody care about Mike in SC. Second, Mike is not a good promoter of your bill.
I hope to God @VP never will ever become President!So scary he is 2nd in line!
Poor excuse for a human
Fake,Fraud,Fictional,False-the 4 'F's on VP's claim!!!!Make Demand 2 ur State rep 2 Not Support & Vote NO  @BillCassidy #Grahamcassidy!!!
Make Demand 2 ur State rep 2 Not Support & Vote NO  @BillCassidy #Grahamcassidy!!!VP spreading falsehoods same as #grahamcassidy
@VP
PENCE IS LYING AND HIS PRE EXISTING CODITION WOULD GET WAIVED BY STATES
A liar speaking on behalf of other liars to give credibility to the lies.
Pence is a white dominionist .. so are Bannon and the Mercers ... read this from @ChrisHedges ..
Hope you keep him honest. A big task, I know.
i saw him coming up, so I switched the station...I would prefer he interview with Mueller under oath
Replace it with Jesus care and pray all your ailments away!
Fake misdirection. This eliminates $248 billion from Healthcare.  #factsmatter
You mean no more freebies
The  big question is can a country that’s $20 trillion in debt afford Obamacare ??
Well, let's cut healthcare to congress then
Too many so called republican senators want to expand Medicaid instead of making healthcare affordable while they have their own special hc
What about the reduced funding of Medicaid? 250 billion. Also cuts blue states more than red. Politicizing healthcare.
Pence is a Lying RUSSIAN agent and will go to Jail for it. TREASON,ESPIONAGE= LIFE in Prison have a good day.
Ok scarecrow
Just get the Bill done so I can sign it.  Oh, crap. Oops. Did I just say that out loud? Probably didn't mention the impeachment either.
Why there be mention of something that doesn't exist
Glad I'm missing that
Obamacare is dead. It failed. Would be nice to take politics out of it and fix it. But then what would MSM/cable news talk about?
How many times over the last seventy years did Republicans do anything other than say "no"?  You get to second-guess now?
While Pence has the best taxpayer healthcare .and collects a big check from @Koch_Industries The rest of us can pray sickness away
Mike Pence another one of Americas MOST WANTED CRIMINALS
Yes Pence is
How do we repeal YOU Mike Pence?
the enemy of the people AKA the media was silent over what obooba did, WOW
Can't trust Pence neither.
@MikePenceVP is a liar.
@LindseyGrahamSC is a liar.
@BillCassidy is a liar.
Hard to call it stealing when u don't pay for it
Don't you mean the continued efforts to kill America
Because both Graham and Cassidy ARE lying about the #GrahamCassidyDeathBill .... here is the truth
What would the Graham-Cassidy bill mean for your health care? We broke it down for you this morning on @MSNBC
