Just passing a bill to say it was accomplished.  Not looking out for all Americans partucularly those in Blue States.
Not the best.  The best is to fully repeal & for you Graham to retire. @seanhannity @VP @POTUS @RandPaul
You're a snake.
Shame
You think your seat is safe?
The best path forward for any elected representative is to listen to the ppl. This is OUR country.
just when i was starting to believe that you were one of the last reasonable republicans. what irresponsible garbage this is. #bullshit

#GreatReads: The staggering hypocrisy of Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham: http://bit.ly/2xkjGXg  @mattyglesias 
People will die because of this... 32 million off healthcare.
You're garbage and even Republicans don't like you.
Oh, Miss Lindsey, that is SO WRONG. It's cute you're trying to make a name for yourself, but please just sit down. 
#ACASavesLives
The best path forward is to vote all of the Senators who support this horrific bill out of office. #GrahamCassidyKills
Idiot
I doubt it's best for us.
Zombie legislation - you guys are so desperate to repeal you can't see it will hurt the economy.  Short Sighted.
You are full of it.  Pretending to be a man of reason and morals.  If that were true, you would be holding Trump accountable.  But nope.
In the past I have found myself semi-liking you.  Kiss your constituents good-bye.  We want NOTHING to do with you!!
Liar.
Give congress the same health care as we, the little peons, get for health care
You're a liar.
The best path forward is to vote the no conscience republicans out .
NO! NO! NO!
Just fix the #ACA Don't KILL IT! 
Remember, if Trump signs this bill & becomes law & he's impeached, you're a closeted old fool!
Every time @LindseyGrahamSC does something worthy he turns around and does 3 totally shitty things..
Yup. 

Why @LindseyGrahamSC ?
When your buddy  @SenJohnMcCain is out of the senate & needs to buy insurance, he'll be f*cked!
It is NOT the best path for people like your friend @senjohnmccain. @joenbc Don't u see DT tweets are to distract you from this? GET ON IT
Millions ask Why would cutting 30 million American's healthcare b good?CA 6th largest econ in world pays more in taxes than it receives.SICK
The more publicity, the better.The pro-life aspects matter, as does the fact that govt. stays out of patient care. #GCHJ can unite GOP.#hope
You mean pro-birth?
Finally? The @GOP @SpeakerRyan & @SenMajLdr have fully supported & fully funded Obama care for 7+ years. I think this is smoke & mirrors.
I have Medicare and private as my secondary.I have never had a donut hole until Obamacare. Prices exhorbant now.REPEAL...
The best path for whom, exactly?
Will you be on this plan Lindsey?
Talk to us when you have a CBO score. The best path forward is to STOP SABOTAGING OBAMACARE.
JUST A BUNCH OF LIES COMING FROM A #LAIR AND THIS IS COMING FROM SOMEONE WHO COULDN'T EVEN GET 5% OF VOTES FOR PRESIDENT.
Are u reading your replies?. Ur not a popular person right now!! Shame on u! Hurting elderly, sick and poor. How do u sleep
Can I ask, with all sincerity, why are you so eager to kill me? This will do it.
The best way for who?  For the disabled? For seniors? For children? For women? For the poor? Oh yeah, best for the rich?? Absurd spin!
You are just pure evil


@LindseyGrahamSC is showing he is advocate of hate by using Breitbart for his message
You are not listening to your constituents. They want an improved #ACA not #GrahamCassidy. Quit trying to save face for Republicans.
Best path forward is for our family in SC to vote you out you undermine our POTUS go on Fake News Channels bash him & sit up D.C. Doing Zero
The best path forward for whom? Not the American people.
What's wrong pussyboy?  So e grand effort to impress McCain so he will sleep with u?
Even you know this is bullshit!!! Don't you?
The states always pushing for States' rights haven't demonstrated an ability to govern- sick people, terrible roads/infrastructure, Third
World poverty.   I can't imagine how much worse the South could get without oversight from the Federal government.  Shameful!
You're a despicable, disgusting asshole. You should be ashamed of yourself. Will vote straight ticket Democrat 1st time in life in 2018. 
I have a pre-existing condition. So do both of my parents. Why are you trying to kill us?
.@LindseyGrahamSC Why are you and the GOP so determined to take away Americans' health care, including pre-existing conditions protections?
best path is for u to fix the current system instead of gutting it and hurting the sick/old But hey thank goodness the rich get tax breaks
If this bill doesn't cover #PreexistingConditions I want NO part of it !!
Ea
No Way, No How, No McCain

Well the American people have spoken on this senator already. Keep going and we will repeal and replace you and the rest of the GOP
You need to support the ACA!  Repair and strengthen it.
@AARP what say you?
@AP @BBC @Reuters @ProPublica @WSJ @TopherSpiro @benwikler


The last-ditch GOP Senate ACA repeal bill would let state’s gut protections for people with pre-existing conditions. https://www.cbpp.org/blog/cassidy-grahams-waiver-authority-would-gut-protections-for-people-with-pre-existing-conditions … 
No. You are wrong. This will hurt Americans. Don't. Just don't.
The best path forward is to repair the ACA.
How much longer til the next election?  If Rs do this w/out hearings, I will NEVER vote R again.
NO WAY!
That's alright, we all enjoy watching your failures. You GOP are at least dependable enough to fuck up your own agendas without much effort.
#GrahamCassidy would decimate #Medicaid—a program that millions of families rely on. Call the Senate now: 202-224-3121 #ProtectOurCare
Everyone can see what you're doing and you deserve eternal shame for it. You're a horrible person.
This last ditch effort to yank healthcare from 20M is sneaky & dishonest.
You've never had to pay your own Med Ins. Ind policies w PreX $$$$
Bullshit.
Can you guarantee my $13,000 a month chemo drug for my "pre-existing" leukemia will still be covered if I can't work anymore?
We will defeat you Russkie traitor.

NOOOOOOOOOOO!  What part of NO do you not understand?
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  WHAT part of NO do you not understsnd?
Leave the swamp! Your a snake in the grass!
Do you hate women? Because your bill sure does.
I'm terrified of ACA repeal.  You are going to kill me.  I've had Republicans tell me they want me to die.  What the hell is wrong with you?
For whom?
Honestly you are both disgusting for what you are trying to do. Heartless. Spineless.  Typical GOP.  You will be judged.
Nope, if we don't get single payer then you can take a hike
NO
This is how he was bought.  https://twitter.com/lizzieshore/status/879792015159861249 … Cassidy-Graham targets the most vulnerable American ppl by bribing states. VoteNo!
Incredible story here showing how Senators are controlled by donors. Wow. This is how they're bought. http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-gop-donors-health-care-taxes-20170626-story.html …
BS.
My health insurance is part of compensation package at work, as is yours. Why would I allow anyone to put that in jeopardy? Lower my wages?
If you think it's so great, why you trying to pass it on the weekend?
Lindsey is selling Out America. A path forward? You're pathetic.
Your bill should be the standard of other areas in government too like education . Return it to the states and we will see who’s idea better

This from May 6 is an infuriating artifact: both Cassidy and Graham criticizing House for EXACT thing they are doing https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/05/06/does-it-pass-the-jimmy-kimmel-test-asks-senator-who-authored-proposal-to-replace-obamacare/?utm_term=.a71d3db5362e …
GrahamCassidy is not a path forward, except in the sense of Sherman's March to the sea. It is a cruel travesty. And it is yours.
Everyone call your Senator and ask them to vote YES on #GrahamCassidy.
One provider -  Frrling the Bern.

Hey @LindseyGrahamSC How could you listen to my concerns for my child's life & then propose a #healthcarebill that could kill her? 
You take our health care away you will pay dearly   God will punish u. We don't have to lift a finger
If the "path" is to "death and bankruptcy for millions of Americans", I would agree with your assessment.
Does your bill propose that all members of Congress have to buy their own care from the #TrumpCare #CassidyGraham crap plan? #RESIGN #Resist
Nope 
The WORST plan so far. People with preexsting conditions like my 20 year old daughter will suffer. USA deserves better.
Why do you hate Americans?  Ppl deserve healthcare.  You have yours why can't we have ours.  Support ACA.  Down with GOP.

Hey @LindseyGrahamSC How could you listen to my concerns for my child's life & then propose a #healthcarebill that could kill her? 
your block grants would free states to simply give money to there buddies not those who need it
u suck
why don't you care if people die because of no health insurance.
#GrahamCassidy healthcare bill will have the same result as Assad's chemical weapons. Killing innocent Americans. #ACA
I thought you might be one of the good guys, Lindsey. You are worse than Trump. He doesn't know any better. U freaking do! #SaveACA #Resist
Is your goal to let Americans die because they no longer can afford HC? You sir are no better than @realDonaldTrump.
Sorry, but I can't forget what you said -'My party has gone batshit crazy.' So why would I believe in anything you Reps try to pass?
Just when you look like you are putting America first, you pull this shit. Your proposal is heartless & u should be ashamed. #VeteransResist
Horrible! Shame on you!!
#graham-Cassidy forgoes the Kimmel test and has designed and presented us The Walking Dead test for #healthcare
REPEALING THE ACA AFFECTS ALL. There but for the grace of God go any one of us:
WOW. 

Please take 5 minutes & listen to @ElenaHung202 of @LittleLobbyists explain just how dangerous …
NO.  NO. NO HELL NO
I'm a primary care physician, patients will be covered inadequately under this, harming scores of regular people. You're absolutely wrong.
This is lie - pre-existing conditions not at all fairly covered!! Lindsey how about once people over Party !! You bill will kill -

When you kill Obamacare, you're going to kill me. I'm sure you'll have fun stepping over my dead body to congratulate yourselves. Murderers.
I don't want to be reported for offensive content so please imagine the most abusive, profanity laden tweet........... Thank you.
Down with Cassidy-Graham health despair bill!
Nope!
Hey "Lindsey" hands OFF our healthcare!!!!
No. No. No.  if you want to take our healthcare away get rid of yours first.  Why would you help non-humans(businesses) over actual people?
This would be absolutely terrible for my wife & I as she has serious chronic medical conditions, & you want to remove consumer protections.
NOOOOOOO!!  THIS IS HORRIBLE!  You are so CRUEL to actually want to take healthcare coverage away from millions of us! I will fight against!
Yes, burn the village down to save it.

Then, get into a war on another continent we can't get out of.

Then, drive the economy into dirt.
Will you work on something constructive without trying to kill Americans. Leave ACA ALONE
Healthcare is not a right. Keep you and the rest of the swamp out of it.
or is it that you are just a spiteful As @realDonaldTrump ? Put people over party
WTH are you doing? Kissing up to a hateful vile @realDonaldTrump  to undo whatever Obama did no matter how it hurts the citizens you work  4
Wrong
Out of touch.
You're a murderous traitor to the people.
It's hard to express the depth of this republicans dissapointment in graham. He had me fooled but now i know he is just another very bad guy
*Leans into podium* WRONG.
NO!
Your not a good person.  At all.

Immoral strategy to pass an immoral bill: 
Taking $ from PEOPLE in Blue states to give to Red states to win R votes
This should be ILLEGAL!! BOOOOOOO!
Look, a rally with all the people supporting GrahamCassidy. Oops, this is today's rally to support POTUS. Take note...canary in the mine.
No traces of Obamacare please. Bill must provide adequate funds for state to expand contracting with managed care orgs More choices 4people.
@realDonaldTrump job creation should end Medicaid as a handout. Not free but affordable.
No, it's not. Please, please, PLEASE stop lying to people.
Boo on you!!
Why are the @GOP determined to MURDER millions of people?! Is the money you get from the insurance co so important!? SICK!!!!!!
No way to the #GrahamCassidy. Cuts healthcare coverage & puts people w/preexisting conditions at risk.
Some states offer high-risk plans. Also, states contracts with managed care providers could have provision on pre-existing conditions.
What is wrong with you? How many times do the American people have to shout WE DO NOT WANT YOU TO REPEAL OBAMA CARE!
But there are those who do.
bitter republicans cannot lead, still trying to negate a real leader, Obama.
WSJ is a corporate-focused paper; its LITERALLY IN THE NAME. Healthcare is not a cash-cow; its life vs death.

Not true. We must ensure this bill provides coverage for all. Medicaid as we know it ends as a handout. Not free but affordable.
@realDonaldTrump job creation will happen if obstructionists get out of his way. If everyone has a job, they can afford health insurance.
Children and elderly and disabled CANT GET A JOB
There will always be a Medicaid plan for them. I know of no one who did not get medical care in all my years in healthcare.
Senator, where is your compassion?
Um, no thanks. This bill is a travesty.
BOMBSHELL: Graham-Cassidy bill text is clear: under state waivers insurers can charge higher premiums for pre-existing conditions. 

Not true. Those without insurance by 1/1/18 due Obamacare insurance carriers pulling out by yr end could die without continued patient care.

I'm not keeping track. Have you repealed your personal gov-issued insurance plan? Change comes from within.
Give it up. We don't want this plan.
Your bills sucks, you suck and this is your last term.

Why expand the military to protect a country that treats its citizens so poorly?
Is this really the best "the greatest nation" can do?
Lindsey I pass on you your a major disappointment
I wish your seat was up for debate in 18
You're a charming snake, I'll give you that. https://twitter.com/topherspiro/status/909082137311285248 …
Lindsey! REALLY! GOP Has NOTHING! How can you try to destabilize our ONLY WORKING healthcare? This isn't Obamacare-its OUR CARE
You’re wiping out protections for sick people.  You’re a moral monster.
This goes far beyond the BCRA, McConnell's bill that failed. It is the complete wiping out of protections for pre-existing conditions. https://twitter.com/TopherSpiro/status/908718687116505090 …
Doubtful
It's awful for the sick, elderly,  children,  women, disabled and poor.  Exactly who does this help rich healthy people.

Lindsey is the DEVIL! Look what CBO says! Do your homework! Call your senators and say NO to GrahamCassidy #Save ACA
Why are you so eager to take away people's healthcare?
Your "best path" will harm millions of Americans. Better option is Medicare for all funded by payroll & income taxes.

BOMBSHELL: Graham-Cassidy bill text is clear: under state waivers insurers can charge higher premiums for pre-existing conditions. 
Your bill is garbage.
More shit
The best path forward is for your awful bill to die just like all the previous awful Republican bills designed to destroy the ACA.
No
https://twitter.com/topherspiro/status/909082137311285248 …
Do not put public through this farce again.  ACA is people's choice. Congress works for the people, remember that??
Bs your bill is crap.
