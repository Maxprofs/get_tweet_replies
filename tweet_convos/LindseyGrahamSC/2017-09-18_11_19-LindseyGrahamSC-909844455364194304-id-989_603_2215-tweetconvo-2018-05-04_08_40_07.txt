My statement on #GrahamCassidy #RepealAndReplace 
NOT SO GOOD FOR SO CALLED CHRISTIANS TO BREAK WHAT WORKS FOR THE PEOPLE& AMERICA, THEN LIE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HARMING&CRUSHING THEM MORE
GOD WILL ALLOW CONSEQUENCES FOR PEOPLE and POLITICIANS THAT DO GREAT HARM TO THE MASSES OF PEOPLE ESPECIALLY OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS
SABATOGING THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM OF ACA TO FUND WEALTHCARE! THE BIBLE SPEAKS OF THESE EVIL TYPE PEOPLE +POLITICIANS=AS YE SOW YE SHALL REAP!
THIS IS JUST ONE MORE REASON GOP HAD PLANNED TO MILITARIZE THE POLICE YEARS AGO WHEN THEY THOUGHT OF WEALTHCARE TAKING AWAY FROM AMERICANS!
THE GOP NAZIS KNEW THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO JUST LIE THERE and TAKE THIS NAZI CRAP BEING PULLED ON THEM! USA GOP TERRORISTS!
FIGURE IN THE "WAR ON TERROR," &A HUGE WAR GOP HAS WANTED FOR YEARS IN THE PLANNING&DECISION MAKING PROCESS NOW FOR PROFIT&HUGE DISTRACTIONS
ONE OF THEIR BIGGEST DISTRACTIONS IS TO RENDER INTENSE HUMAN SUFFERING ONTO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO KEEP THEM IN THE DARK&FROM FIGHTING BACK!
What job is that? Ripping healthcare away from millions,  making it too expensive for just about everyone because of preexisting conditions?
Hard to believe you're handing over your career in order to take ins from us, your constituents. Oh, aren't you up for re-election this yr?
Hold my covfefe I will find out who is running and give my first donation
Cassidy is up as well.
No he is not I voted for him !
For Cassidy?
Why can't you guys come up with something good. If you can't, you'll be fired!  YOURE FIRED!!
You have had over 7 years to get the job done.  All that is needed is fixing the ACA, but the GOP only want to destroy Obama legacy.
How long be4 we have proof you knew about Russia the ENTIRE TIME? You'd better get on the right side of this death bill & everything else.
#SaveACA
This is part of the reason Ducey won't be re-elected.
@SenJohnMcCain Yes & he will become complicit when Millions lose HC just so @SenateGOP can fund @POTUS TaxPonzi Scheme for Rich. Amer knows.
YOU SHOULD STOP LYING TO PEOPLE   #Karma
Get the job done? You're half assing your job. This is a "band-aid" solution. Obamacare sucks, I get it, but this isn't the way to fix it.
Another reckless and unconscionable attempt to destroy healthcare. No one in America deserves to suffer, be bankrupt, or die due to greed.
Sad to see my senator @billcassidy choose political friends like Trump/Pence over the people of his state.

Obamacare is failing because of GOP backdoor deals with @mtbert to trade ACA market collapse for anti-competitive mergers. https://twitter.com/SenateMajLdr/status/910569501921443840 …
WHY WAS HELP NOT SENT TO PUERTO RICO SOONER!!!
Do you think you make a bit of difference Pence? You fancy boy.
Stop playing political games with us 
This is not a political issue
This is a moral issue concerning all americans


Jimmy Kimmel doubles down, slams Sen. Cassidy, Trump and ‘Fox & Friends’ over health-care bill http://wapo.st/2hkFEQJ 
When did the R goal change from responsible governing via rules of order to "repeal Obamacare by an arbitrary date"? #NotmyRepublicanParty
How is this better for ppl with pre-existing condition? I still couldn’t afford it!!! Lies..........

Notice that nothing is said about the bill bring good for Americans

#GrahamCassidy cuts #Medicaid. 1,750,000 veterans covered by Medicaid. A vote for #GrahamCassidy is a vote to take healthcare from veterans.
SPECIAL PLACE IN HELL FOR YOU GUYS AND  YOUR CORRUPTION

Dear @LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy & @realDonaldTrump Fuck y'all and the Big Pharma, Big Insurance, Koch Sucking, horse you rode in on. 
All you do Pence is parrot what your boss and party say. Don't you have any ideas of your own? U might be president someday soon, so buck up
I guess that you are going to enroll yourself and  "mother" in this great healthcare plan
Liar!  Shame!  
REPEAL O CARE
I live in AZ and he's towing the party line disgracefully. No CBO score = No Facts

What is it with your RIDICULOUS need to ram this through without THINKING through ramifications? Are you & @GOP REALLY this irresponsible?
MAKE CALLS!
dems screwed up healthcare to a degree that is hard to understand, single payer would bankrupt America personal taxes would go through  roof
Actually, read the #MedicareForAll bill. You may be surprised, multiple funding methods. Then help us fight for #MedicareForAll
You do know since many states have expanded medicare it's close to bankruptcy also, yes?
Wrong, don't believe whatever news source your getting. They are lying to you.
I'm so glad that Doug Douchey is supporting the Graham Cassidy the Punish and enslave plan
@BillCassidy @dougducey
Liar
Pence only wants to see as many Americans as possible die to make him happy
"the job" of taking away healthcare for the poorest
Bill is a disgrace and arguments for it are fraudulent
wow, ur referencing dougie douchie?  LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!
That's nice trying to get the Senator to vote your way! History is not going to be nice to such cruel, heartless people!
Harvey took our homes, jobs and left us with almost nothing. Then you step and take the rest, our healthcare!
The Koch bros have hired you for a job, and they're not paying into your slush funds until the hit is done.

If you too are disappointed in Sen @BillCassidy #GrahamCassidy let them know it - call (202) 224-3121 
@BillCassidy @dougducey Pence:  Hope it covers conversion therapy for you.
Ducey's a sack of MRSA.
The Creep Veep
Trump Puppet.

No conserv who cheers ripping away the insurance for babies born with critical diseases (for tax cuts) can EVER claim to be pro-life again.

@dougducey is a LYING http://REPUBLICAN.CALL   (202) 224-3121! Tell the SENATE NO ON GRAHAM-CASSIDY! Do it EVERYTIME YOU CAN! EVERY DAY!
Most importantly!  CALL  (202) 224-3121! Tell the SENATE NO ON GRAHAM-CASSIDY! Do it EVERYTIME YOU CAN! EVERY DAY THIS WEEK!
This will come as a tremendous shock to you, but no one cares what you think.
Your agenda to end anything Obama accomplished hurts America(ns). The job is to do what is good/right for the American people. Fix the ACA!
GRAHAM-CASSIDY OS A DISASTER FOR MANY AMERICANS! IT MUST BE STOPPED!!!
ICYMI, "the job" is not to take +/- 30M ppl off healthcare & restore lifetime caps. "The job" is to provide for the health of the nation.

What Graham-Cassidy will do to people with pre-existing conditions, an issue long thought untouchable, is simply reprehensible.
I challenge Senator Cassidy to go back on Jimmy Kimmel's show and explain why he lied!
#GOPSerialKiller you mean it's time 2 kill childhood cancer survivors who won't be able to afford premiums so you can give tax breaks 2 rich
Good to see a bunch of Republicans getting ready to lose their jobs if they repeal the incredibly effective and popular Obamacare.
@BillCassidy @dougducey how do any of you call yourselves christians? Appalling act of self aggrandizement (look it up)
Your plan is not well thought out. Wait for the scoring for the budget.

Your boss wants to drop a nuke to kill people overseas,  I see you want to kill Americans first. Well, you've found a way to "get it done".
human garbage right here folks,
Time to fuck middle America again Pence . New phrase - your a Pence of shit .
It should be called the "Lie Bill" (and so should @BillCassidy )
It fails the #JimmyKimmelTest

Why do you support this plan that under 10% of this country supports? Because party first, right?
Pence the fake Christian wanting to strip away pre-existing conditions. Scum is correct description for you.
You think unaffordable premiums for cancer patients, pregnant women, autistic Americans, diabetics, etc. is a good thing? #disgusting
Shame! How can you sleep at night? Do you imagine your constituents are going to forget this Nov 18? You're toast!
The GOP are monsters, this bill is genocide, why do u hate Americans and worship greed and hurting people? Pathetic
So Mr VP why are they doing this bill in secret. This bill is not the answer.
Hey yes man, take that piece of crap plan and shove it you no where. Selfish repub jerks only care about the rich. $400M from the Kochs
Save our healthcare!! Fix the #ACASavesLives
Graham is a crazy man wants to hurt All of us
HEY TAMPON HEAD GOOD TO SEE THAT.......
We all don't support the Graham Cassidy bill I thinks going to hurt you if you do
Karma is a bitch guys! Wishing u all the best robbing Americans of their healthcare and seeing the results in the next election!
@BillCassidy @dougducey
Another shameless suckup clueless to the will of the American people. Worse than last attempt with 12% support? How do you clowns sleep?
This bill is worse than the others. It punishes. Real religious of you
He forgot Hypocrite!!!
the only job you are doing is to take healthcare away from people and putting money in the pockets of insurance companies and rich Americans
Wrong.
Go jump in the Gulf of Mexico Pence. Its a good jumping off place for you and the entire admin. along with your crooked GOP.
The job of taking insurance from 30 million Americans? That's what you mean?
VP you are hurting millions of Americans. This is not getting a job done. There is no replacement. You wish suffering on this country.
The job of fucking over millions. Honestly, you are one faux Xtian.
FYYFFVP
#hypocrite

People with pre-existing conditions, pregnant women among those who lose out in GOP's latest health care bill. http://apne.ws/iP7et7Z 

If you too are disappointed in Sen @BillCassidy #GrahamCassidy let them know it - call (202) 224-3121 
It's time for Mueller to his job done and impeach Trump and you
so he supports cutting $1.2 billion going to Arizona and reducing care for people.  Maybe Congress should run the #'s. #shame
Bullshit doesn't pass the @jimmykimmel test
The job of screwing people out of healthcare under the guise of states rights. When you sign up for the plan you're pushing, you can talk

You would approve #FakeChristian
Americans aer getting jobbed by you monsters.
HORRID to see @VP supporting WEALTHCARE that would kill MILLIONS of Americans, including my son.  SHAME on @GOP. SHAME
Pence says ppl don't need healthcare they just need to go to church and be healed. Wacky do. Bet he uses his insurance.
I agree wake up Congress !
just shut up!
#GrahamCassidy is not a healthcare plan, it's a @SenateGOP campaign fundraising project:
Snow job? Check.
Con job? Check.
How many times have you lied about Russian contacts?
How can you live with yourselves if this comes to pass? How is this a better plan than the ACA? A hateful bill. Truly will kill people.
AZ - Minnesota followed this admin's instructions & is now getting penalized.  They can't be trusted.
BREAKING: Trump & ACA repeal is supposedly all about increased state flexibility. This is what happened when the governor of MN believed it. 
Which job, fucking over hard working Americans?  Didn't you do enough damage in Indiana?  Got to screw up the rest of the country too?
Boo
Pence is going to prison.  I'll look after mother.  She'll like me.
MONSTERS--all of you.
@GOP needs to kill and bankrupt more Americans so they can declare victory #GrahamCassidyBill #ProtectOurCare
Anyone who supports #GrahamCassidy is evil, starting with you @VP and @POTUS.
Not a Christian you have no compassion....don't ever claim that every life is sacred again. You are not pro-life
Wearing your Senate hat, can't you prevent a recess until this gets a vote?
leave our insurance alone in light of all these disasters you would even think of pulling this s___!  your all liars on how accurate CBO

Wonder no more. The Koch donor network will give GOP $400M for 2018 *only if ACA is repealed* & tax reform passes https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/26/koch-network-piggy-banks-closed-republicans-healthcare-tax-reform …
Block grants didn't work out well for Indiana when then-Governor diverted funds meant for low income families.  Pence is trying to fool you.
Graham-Cassidy aka #TrumpCare fails on three levels: 1. More expensive  2. Less coverage 3. Covers fewer people #GOPFail @LindseyGrahamSC
#GrahamCassidy won't improve healthcare. It will strip coverage from millions and degrade the coverage for millions more. Shameful.
you are not addressing the drivers of cost. Insurance co's and pharma.
Watch the VIDEO. Find out what is really in the bill. On @MSNBC with @JRubinBlogger

As long as you give up your health plan, Mr. VP. Lets see you have hard times like the rest of us for once. #gophastogo
THESE MEN ARE LIARS @BillCassidy  @LindseyGrahamSC @SenateMajLdr
JUST IN: American Medical Association comes out against new ObamaCare repeal bill http://hill.cm/UrYXlMA  
Hey, fuckface VP, #GrahamCassidy will force sick people to decide between suicide or creating crushing debt for their families. Murderer!

#GreatReads: The staggering hypocrisy of Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham: http://bit.ly/2xkjGXg  @mattyglesias 
What job done? KILLING MILLIONS? RAISING PREMIUMS?  
MASSIVE PREMIUMS 4 PREEXISTING CONDITIONS?
ELIMINATING OUT OF POCKET LIMIT? Want more?
YOU REPUBLICANS ARE VILE PEOPLE!
Our president said that his plan would be better and cost less. This is going to result in people dying because they can't afford care.
It's NOT GOOD to see you supporting #GrahamCassidy instead of those who will lose their insurance. You claim to value life? BS!
You are evil.
The job that needs to get done is to improve ACA, not replace it with a GOP plan that takes healthcare away from millions of Americans.
#nazisinthewhitehouse
You support this now? Shame
Time to get job done? You mean ripping healthcare from ppl in most vulnerable stages of their lives so u can prove u hate all things Obama?
