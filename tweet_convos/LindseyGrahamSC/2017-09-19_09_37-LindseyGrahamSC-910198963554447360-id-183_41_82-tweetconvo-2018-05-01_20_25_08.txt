Senator Graham, Your insurance proposal will take away insurance from millions of people.Including children, vets, disabled and elderly ppl.
Swampy backroom politics #FollowtheMoney
Instead of killing sick Americans by passing #GrahamCassidyBill why don't you focus on Russia's attack on us?
@VP These two old queens prefer to call it a saucy 'Policious Brunch'.  #queens #deathcare #brunch #Trumpcare

No conserv who cheers ripping away the insurance for babies born with critical diseases (for tax cuts) can EVER claim to be pro-life again.
Take the graham/Cassidy bill and shove it up their asses!
These two right here, Pence & Graham are plotting to steal your healthcare coverage! 202-225-3121.

The bill sucks and a lie.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/09/21/sen-cassidys-rebuttal-to-jimmy-kimmel-more-people-will-have-coverage/?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_factchecker-cassidy-335am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.59311771cf32 … @SenJohnMcCain   #congress
@SenJohnMcCain @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski Koch blood money over health care 4 millions? Please no #CassidyGraham
Wonder no more. The Koch donor network will give GOP $400M for 2018 *only if ACA is repealed* & tax reform passes https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/26/koch-network-piggy-banks-closed-republicans-healthcare-tax-reform …

@LindseyGrahamSC & Pence > when Pence goes down will Lindsay follow?

People with pre-existing conditions, pregnant women among those who lose out in GOP's latest health care bill. http://apne.ws/iP7et7Z 
We desperately would like to everyone that is on these govt aircraft that top govt officials use. That would be useful. Is this info avail?
@VP 

Getting that Koch $?#GrahamCassidyBill takes from Americans to give to the Top 1%. #GovtCorruption
Whatever crediblity you may have had withered away with your so called plan that would throw millions of @ordinaryfaces under the bus-2of2
Hope you had fun riding on Air Force 2 (1 of 2)

A bill -- finalized yesterday, has not been scored, amendments not allowed, and 3 hours final debate -- should be viewed with caution.
Lindsey turned into a Putin too.
Rash, brutal, irresponsible, immoral
TRUST JIMMY KIMMEL!!! HE SAYS CASSIDY IS A LIAR & HIS BILL SUCKS!! VOTE NO!!
This. Is. Incredible. Watch, share, and call 202-224-3121 
Shame shame shame on you. How can you do something like this? Are you playing politics? What about the people? Sad!
Lindsey, you have become the most unreliable reasonable Republican with your shifting positions.  Stop hurting US citizens. What is on you?
@LindseyGrahamSC you are a shame
So glad you could decide how to screw over tens of millions over lunch that we are probably paying for in the first place.
How dare you steamroll a bill don't you care of the citizens of this country?  Cassidy is full of excuses and so are you.  Have some pride

If you too are disappointed in Sen @BillCassidy #GrahamCassidy let them know it - call (202) 224-3121 
We the people say NO to your bill you need to listen #peopleb4party
We don't want your bill why is that so hard to understand.
Senator Graham:  I have never been more disappointed in you than right now.  How can u look people in the eye and say ur bill is good?
You appall me, Senator Graham. Your bill isn't healthcare it is a death sentence to those with pre-existing conditions. Deplorable bill
Sponsoring a bill that results in 23 million less insured is not only unpatriotic, but it's extremist.
Lindsey: did the Koch bros money go in your pocket? Name the bill after them. #boughtandpaidfor
Cruel people
With old, white haters @VP rushes to fuck bipartisanship & Americans with this unscored bill, no hearings.

Graham bragged about taking money from "big blue states" CA & NY: makes GOP House sticking it to their constituents for "party" very salient

I like Graham.  Pence I do not.
Hey, Lindsey, the responses to this tweet don't seem to be what you were wishing for. I haven't read one supportive of your Death Bill yet
Pence and Graham return to DC to plot stealing healthcare from 10 million to pick up 400 million $$ from Koch brothers for 2018. 
Fixed this

The ACA is not socialism, it simply needs fixed. If however, this repeal is passed, the backlash will be a single payer system. Don't do it.
LG your 5 minutes of fame your name on abillit are thru. Dohomework 4 another year to come close to the effort put in by Team Obama
Lyndsey Graham is going to KILL MORE AMERICANS than ISIS-Al Qaeda and the TALIBAN combined Nice Going Sir U should be Proud #GoldStarDad
Go right ahead and take away millions of registered voters health insurance,Graham and GOP. 2018 is just around the corner.Throw the bums
OUT!


I used to like Sen. Graham. Now he wants to take health insurance away from me and millions like me. I pay for mine and struggle. Sick!

Healthy American's = Strong America!
I will take life over your political diatribe. #resist 
Lindsey Graham: We must choose "socialism or federalism" for health care

Money from the Koch Bros. is why this Repeal of Healthcare has resurfaced!
You're a SLEAZY PIECE OF Senator.  #resist
Seems. Like  trump or OECD flies someplace new every single day.  What s waste  of taxpayer money.
Creeps out to take your health care. Even worse than the last time
Two idiots that know nothing about Healthcare and a lot about tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires
I had faith that @LindseyGrahamSC would  not allow the repubs to take away the necessary benefits to save families.  "Winning" is not a win.
Trump should of shared his hair spray with Lindsey
Oh how sweet hope they don't choke on their chicken bone- oh that's right they have Cadillac insurance no worries for them!
Thick as thieves these two.  Wait.  Pence and Graham together on a plane?   Hmmmm.  #tastetherainbow @VP
Now that you have Bannon on your side, maybe he can teach you the trick of keeping the rug pasted down.
trump hole....you've put in with putin.
Good
For
You
Telling moment from Graham:

Notes CA & NY are "big blue states"…
Two snakes on a plane,
You're taking away my health care
@VP @LindseyGrahamSC Mr.Pence & Mr Graham, i fear for u @ judgement. Matt 25:40. He knows intentions Matt 12:25, Hebrews 4:12 @markknoller
Mr Pence & Mr Graham - Revelation 2:23 "I am He who searches the minds & hearts; and I will give to.." @markknoller /1
Mr Pence & Mr Graham - Revelation 2:23 "..each one of you according to your deeds." thats 32m pp, Sirl! @markknoller /2
@realDonaldTrump Please don't harm US!We shouldn't fear paying for #healthcare more than being injured or sick
SHAME ON YOU!!! Your #Graham-Cassidy bill is WRONG for AMERICANS!!! Why don't you FIX #ACA!!! ACA ISN'T SOCIALISM & DOES NOT MARCH TO IT!

YOU r no better than the piece of pond scum sitting in the oval office.working with the  that is a constant embarrassment to this country!
Back to rob Americans of health care!
Bill and Lindsey fist bump another Dead American for lack of Health Care! Health Care is a Human Right!
VP Pence and Graham discuss how they will ruin the lives of millions of Americans so the Koch Brothers will have lower taxes
2 angry white men who can't wait to cost lives. They sit there collect free insurance & drool over suffering. No decency left in GOP
#Graham is an officer, but is no gentleman. @LindseyGrahamSC doesn't care how veterans or POWs are denigrated or denied care.#iserved #USAF
I'm more impressed at how VP Pence's hair stayed immaculate in the wind.

You mean DEATH policy luncheon. On the menu 400 million nuggets from koch brothers.
Well Senator, time 2step up for the people. Since there isn't even a CBO Score - sounds like the little people are the furthest from ur mind
CBO score???
Shouldn't this say "how to murder millions of Americans lunch"!? #SavetheACA so people with pre-ex conditions won't die like before the ACA!
Please don't forget that the Pres assaulted women & said he enjoys grabbing them by the pussy. These actions emotionally hurt so many women.
Vipers planning to take away care for elderly and the disabled. Because, you know that's the "Christian" thing to do
Block-grants can be spent by the States any way they want. Won't have to go toward healthcare.
Look to supporting ACA cost-sharing reduction payments & risk-corridor program instead. ACA can and does work for Americans. 10 Govs say no.
Republican Govs from Ohio, Nevada, Alaska, Vermont, Massachusetts come out AGAINST new #GrahamCassidy bill. VOTE NO!
You don't $peak for good American people. Good Americans want easily affordable healthcare, even with pre existing conditions, for all
Mass murderers
Lindsey modeling trump's easy breezy fly away hair look. Pence still looks like a wax figure. Both want to deny millions healthcare. #RESIST
You are on the wrong side of humanity. Why? Why would you want to gut millions of ppls healthcare? And u will if this passes & U know that!
Watch the VIDEO. Find out what is really in the bill. On @MSNBC with @JRubinBlogger
GOP is only about getting rid of everything President Obama did
No vote, shame on you, will see you at your next town hall meeting.
Liar, liar. You know the Drmocrats have offered fixes for the ACA. Can you say "ACA" or do your lips just say "Obamacare"?Liar.
you are an evil man. Put your country in front of your dilapidated party. Make yourself standout rather than be forever derided.....
#traitors
Turning ur back on @SenMcCain and all of us who will suffer if you take our ACA. Unspeakably cruel. Houston & Fla already going thru enough
Look at the premium costs for even a HISTORY of cancer! Even for survivors.
Graham, Pence Neither of you can claim to be Christian anymore. Hope you have a good lunch while u kick disabled, elderly,poor off medicaid
NEW:Let's be clear. These are hardball tactics.

Republicans say repeal or nothing. People be damned.

Who got to you? Are you being threatened or your family?  How much did they pay you?



THE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE ACT SAVED MY LIFE... @BarackObama
You truly are a disgrace. Selling out Americans just to have a "win". What happened to the bipartisan effort?
NO!!!! They will be getting 400 MILLION DOLLARS from the Koch brothers for 2018 elections ONLY if they repeal Obamacare.
Linsey Graham YOU ARE A LIAR. I HAVE READ YOUR BILL. DROP DEAD, YOU LIAR
gd idea let the racist have complete power..
LG you are on the wrong side of history with health care. Single payer will same gov money.  The math is not on your side.
you gd idea let the racist have complete power..
When you are born on 2nd base, but you think you hit a double.

Too bad you could swallow it down! Compromised too? Taking insurance away from millions is a cowardly act!
Graham-Cassidy aka #TrumpCare fails on three levels: 1. More expensive  2. Less coverage 3. Covers fewer people #GOPFail @BillCassidy
Pence and @LindseyGrahamSC are
Co-conspirators in the destruction of healthcare and our country.

Proud of Senator Graham.
Nothing to be proud about. when people are faced with life & death. I hope you can sleep at night if this bill passes. The destruction
Looks like Graham has Trumps hair disease.
You beat me to it.

All the puppets to the puppeteer Trump!
Plotting the destruction of Obamacare. No doubt.
Absolutely! Every once in awhile I think Lindsey is a decent man, but then he reminds me he's just a typical lying Republican.
Me too. I fell for his deception previously.  Never again!
I fought/fight for #LGBTQ rights. I once thought Lindsey was gay, but I now think he may be asexual. He lacks empathy & only cares for @GOP.
Nah, I still think he's gay #ComeOutLindsay
Yeah, but I hate to call him out on something that it's ok to be. But then, he's living in closet. Nothing's sadder than a gay conservative!
I hear ya and agree completely.  People shouldn't be ashamed of who they are unless they're Republican of course. 
My daughter gave me one that said:

 "Republicans are people too.
 Mean, Selfish, Greedy People"
