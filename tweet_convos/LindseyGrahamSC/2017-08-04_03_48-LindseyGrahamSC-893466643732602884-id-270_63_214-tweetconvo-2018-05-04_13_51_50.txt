How are they gonna fire the leaker if they don't know who it is
Assuming they aren't/don't know the leakers....& if they've known all along, how do they get away with not doing anything about knowing.
Well technically they are considered whistle blowers and they have a law that protects them
True. Although, since court of law is based on opinion, it's all vague.... when does leaker become whistleblower and vice versa?
When the leaks are revealing crimes against the Constitution of The United States of America, it is whistleblowing. That's the litmus test.
However protection is stronger when official channels are tried first. When the WH has been infiltrated, there is no choice but to leak.
Because the handlers of due process are compromised and are the ones who are guilty; leaking is the only option in this case. They r heroes!
Sessions is saying otherwise. Hence the opinion of those in charge is final.... not ideal when they've all got skeletons in the cupboard
The leaking is a very dangerous precedent for our country.  Foreign leaders will not speak candidly to US leadership.
@LindseyGrahamSC well worth being fired for. Whoever you are.
Trump is the leaker are you guys willing to fire him now. Patriotic Americans are leaking because this punk is hurting America.
Where was that outrage for the leaks on Hillary Clinton and Obama? It was fine then.
How about locking them up?
Firing? How about charges and jail.
it was Trump himself
That's not a leak. That is public information! Stop calling them leaks, it makes you look stupid!
I don't care what anyone says whoever is leaking should be hailed as a hero for showing USA just how dangerous sick & misguided Trump is
Wow your a smart one leaking this information endangers the USA... do your hate for Trump, is more important then our safety
Did you forget Trump himself gave high security secrets to the Russians from the Oval Office! Yes I do despise trump because he is a liar
leaks have helped, but Im not sure they were vital. Overall no leaks better, since many are false and planted for unknown effect
Would this be the same Bob Corker who subverted the constitution by turning the treaty provision on it's head on the Iranian agreement?
Leaking is wrong, we love it, but it IS wrong. Scary that Graham starts to make so much sense. It's not about the media, it's the leaker
Leakers are just letting the American people what a fraud we have @realDonaldTrump is bad for #AMERICA #IMPEACHISTHERIGHTTHINGTODO @GOP
Why it had nothing to do with national security it just showed how weak Trump is, thst he is a liar common knowledge & others have ethics.
weekly news maker seekers who are looking for 2020 spots. Don't be fooled by these two trojan horse republican advocates.
It's Robert mueller
Aren't there bigger fish to fry? Palace intrigue will always exist, regardless of Donald Trump's feelings.  it's not like leaking to Russiaâ€¦
Am I missing something? Why are the transcripts of these calls supposed to be secret?
Yes you are. National security is at stake. No leader will again speak candidly on the phone to Washington, D.C.

They are whistle.blowers who should br protected
Uhhhhhhhh Yeah!  Wow... Really going out on a limb there fellas
All these Quisling Republicans with ties to Russia need to be in the nearest cross bar hotel!
@LindseyGrahamSC  is making smoke for DT....more distraction.
Because that would really solve the problem. How about firing the one doing the calls in the first place?
Is @LindseyGrahamSC afraid of something being leaked about him?
transcripts weren't classified. Embarrassing, yes.  Illegal, no.  If he expected no one to ever know, he should've cleared the room
Fire all them leaking unpatriotic sons of a b******
All of the beltway would love to jail reporters who have splash their respective bull.
These leakers are to me true patriots and God Bless them! 100%::
CBS News, how long are you going to stay on the elitists payroll? Or would all of you need protective custody, from the Clinton Crime family
NO WAY >>>>>>>>> leaks are the only way to get the truth out of this White House
Twist a pig's ear, hear him squeal.
Can't fire Ivanka
@ckchumley @oppenheimera @CarlosAMontaner @PanAmPost @patriciajaniot @omarbula @MyrianeLibre @AndresCarrion2
Senators Lindsey Graham and Bob Corker call for firing of "leaker" of Trump call transcripts http://cbsn.ws/2wru2Bp  
Leaking is not good, but in times like these they are so necessary.  Flynn, and all this BS would be hidden by lies.  The lies too!
How about firing the caller instead?
Then you better fire @realDonaldTrump because I am becoming sure he is behind the drama and madness
Did anyone check @Reince 's briefcase before you left him on that tarmac?
"The President has complained bitterly of leaks because he doesn't want to be questioned."

That is exactly right! Dan Rather nailed it!
To do that, we would need to impeach the leaker - Donald Trump himself.
And how long was it before we knew who #DeepThroat was? #GoodLuck
Because they don't want the American people to know what an erratic jerk who lacks any political finesse Trimp really is...
funny how the ones which expose him as a doofus, rude & ill-prepared really bother them, hard to defend those calls so the leaker's an enemy
Where were you 30 years ago up until now? How much life have you lived? Now imagine you were waiting to die.
Save the leaker, save the leaker!!
Even if it turns out to be Pence?
Those leaks were about Trump's ego, Remember this?
Sources: Trump shared classified info with Russians @CNNPolitics
Pish posh!
I call for someone to give him a better job than
Damn right he should be #fired and #prosecuted!
Tell me what national security was breeched?Citizens learned President cares more about image that what he claims as policy.Vital knowledge.
Not a leaker, a whistle blower. There is a difference.
Actually, that person should be given a commendation.
The transcripts were so interesting, were they not?
How about prison.
Deep State is trying to get us all killed
@LindseyGrahamSC Nothing ever gets done about the leakers.
Just firing !?
Wow finally support of Rino's, where the hell is healthcare # Do Your Damn Job
#LindseyGraham rides the fence so much he should be chapped by now.... Only leaking he knows is his own...... ill-founded 2faced man he is

Gen. Tony Thomas explains how a leak to NYT foiled U.S. attempt to kill ISIS leader Baghdadi. Publishing leaks undermines our Natl Sec! 
@LindseyGrahamSC for not supporting president Trump Senator Graham you need to be fired by your constituents
Who is it?  Stop flapping and get to it.
WHY? Fire this patriot ? He/she only provided evidence that he is a liar . Are you embarrassed that you both share a GOP monogram?
How do you fire someone you can't find? How about we fire the fool who showed what a joke he is.
lol, good luck
Damn, now the republiCONz want to fire tRUMP himself..
it was probably trump himself
Agree.   There is only one person who benefited from this and it is WH.  Plays to the deep state narrative and why not last week sucked
@SenBobCorker & @LindseyGrahamSC  tries to find another way to piss off their constituency and double cross @realDonaldTrump. #DIRTYCONGRESS
Don't do anything illegal, then you wouldn't have too worry about leakers
The people need leakers to find out the truth, because potus lies about everything.
What if it was Jeff Sessions?
This person should be prosecuted!
Kinda the problem. If Leakers know they will only get fired and NOT IMPRISONED we're gonna get more of it.
How about firing the Liar?
we need Woodard and Bernstein White House lies
Great, but how do you actually go about firing the donald?
Seems these leaks weren't so much a security issue as they were an embarrassment.
Please don't. How are we ever going to get the truth. Idiot press person lies every day.
The person let the American people know what kind of ass you have for President and you better wake up to it.
They need 2 check #POTUS 1st Just like #Russia #meeting someone he ordered 2 do it will b thrown under the bus Just ask #DonaldJr & #Jared
Good for Graham, was beginning to wonder where his allegiance lay
At least the leaker tells the truth, only lies come from the White House.
No....whistleblowers should be protected.
Don't admit to it, "leaker"     When you are questioned, just LIE...  Donald Trump likes liars, after all, he is one of the biggest.
Thank God for those leaks! They are solid evidence that 45 has the mental and emotional capacity of a spoiled 10 year old.
So it's better to hide a maniacal, narcissistic president from taxpayers?  @sengraham2016?@SenBobCorker?  
Party over country is egregious.
Thats called elections.... get a grip
Yet.....@TGowdySC & @jasoninthehouse were REWARDED for their leaks & Classified Doc alterations. Never mind, wrong team player!
That would prove TRUMP DID NOT COLLUDE WITH RUSSIA!!  Even though collusion is NOT necessarily a crime...
Why....  What DT he hiding?
Maybe the leaker is Pence? He probably wants the job.
If prez didn't lie so much no need for truth leaks. #alternate facts
When L. Graham goes to FOX, he blows COLD. When he visits CNN, he blows HOT. L. Graham has no core. He wants to, but he is NOT John McCain!
dc, where liars and con men live
Those transcripts shouldn't be public. Firing is not enough in this case, I'm shocked this happened.
Amen! A bunch of scumbag ObamaKLAN that need serious time behind bars.They risk our lives by leaking. @SenateGOP Risk war w/Russia w/o facts
What if the foreign governments leaked the transcripts? Every ally is "nudging" us to clean up our act, STAT.
If the gov't operated with appropriate #Transparency, there would be very few leaks.
#CitizensAreStakeholders and #CitizensHaveARightToKnow.
Why? They are acting in America's best interest & not acting illegally. @Michael36776349
with this admin generally the source of the leak has been djt if that helps you guys out  with your investigation...
@lauferlaw good Investigate! What will u do when you find Pence behind it??! or have u thought that far ahead?
So they can fire the president? Awesome!!
Only Firing ?
Hope so
Whistleblowers may have left the WH & took info with them--many left--
Hey guys, maybe it was Mexico or Australia. We are not the only people that think so highly of @POTUS .
This after Republicans pass a bill that strips you of all privacy on the internet. Why so concerned about Treasonous Trump's privacy?
Fire hell, She needs to be prosecuted!
We like knowing what the jerk is saying. He lies so much that see only way we know the truth
Look no farther than Comey & Clapper .
Some people take a risk for the greater good. We should be thankful.
The leaker needs more then fired. That's a form of treason. Needs to be prosecuted then locked up for life or the old days of just hang them
@LindseyGrahamSC And if the leaker is trump? Or trump directed actors? (remember the Nunes play, in 4 acts? Critics raved)
But @realDonaldTrump encouraging leaks from Wikileaks during campaign was fine?
CAMPAIGNS are not the same... We have laws and different standards after one becomes a President.  Very lame argument..
Can they also fire TRUMP for lying to American people?
What is Lindsey trying to gain points? He's going to have to go farther than that.
Just fire the trump
What if was a cabinet member? Some clues point that way.
@LindseyGrahamSC too bad the "leaker" is the @POTUS
get a grip guys... it's called TRANSPARENCY and since Trump is so erratic I am glad we can see how unstable he is #DOYOURJOBSIMPEACHHIM
Too late, Spicer and/or Preibus already quit!!
The leaks are wrong and should be found and prosecuted, but the fact the leaks show Trump suckered his voters about the wall is bad as well
Yes!
It is important for citizens to see exactly how stupid @potus is. He is the one that touted his "Negotiating" skills.
didnt you watch @realDonaldTrump wonderful speech/campaign last night? no Russians here in this story!
from being let go so you must think there is some misconduct in the WH @realDonaldTrump make up your mind Graham.
Leakers of this WH are heroes
No, they are felons, each person that praises such cowardly acts s/b listed to never hire for any job, & def never be in Government! #MAGA
Really?  Start here @SenBobCorker
McMaster says, Susan Rice to keep her top-secret security clearance, West Wing officials concerned  http://bit.ly/2unYL0S 
i think its the Trump admin. that is leaking because the president wants to create confusion. youre the 1 that has a bill to keep Mueller
Russia & Wikileaks still have hacked dirt on GOP...

Explains why USA is being *thoroughly gutted* by Trump GOP--w **global** repercussions
If it was not for the leaks, Americans will be in the dark right of now about Russian interference and our Prez being a Russian agent.
There has been 0 proof of @realDonaldTrump's collusion w/ Russia. Obama & Lynch let the Russians into our country!
Oh brother.
Probably putin playing both ends against the middle...
Once those people were called patriots...but I guess that were other times ...
Exposing a serial liar and threat to all mankind isn't a good thing??? Ever heard of the concept "the greater good"???
GOP **stole** SCOTUS seat
OMG, that is so long ago, and sad to still be talking about. Obama stold the Whitehouse since he was  illegal to run 4, ALL his acts R VOID
i just dont get it...we have a President that lies/wont admit russia interfered or involved in our election yet youre worried about a leak?
@LindseyGrahamSC Why? Because it shows just how much of a grifter and buffoon @realDonaldTrump really is?? Just get the traitor out already.
Lets just fire Trump instead.
Bye Bannon....
Firing? How about prosecution? A couple of D.C. putzes glamming in front of fake news cameras. Seriously pathetic grandstanding.
absolutely,I&my great beauty @margbrennan discussed,really interesting,have many transcripts conversation if Trump,just sharing in moment..
Phone calls should not have been leaked.  People are worried & desperate about Trump's incompetency. Transcripts showed how stupid Trump is
why? let's see this national embarrassment exposed even more
You want to talk about your personal life go ahead but do it on your time not ours
Remember you work for We the People the right to know who you're talking to and what you're saying when it comes to our country our gov
Leakers can be anyone in the WH. Trump himself could be fired with a bill like this. Interesting approach but may need tweaking.
When it comes to this country gentlemen we have a right to know what kind of deals you're making him back rooms with other leaders
Hey @LindseyGrahamSC, if the @GOP had any real honor and value in the first place, no one would feel the need to leak about anything at all.
I wouldn't be surprised if Muller is behind all this, trying to stir up the pot for a Grand Jury. Corruption at its finest
Thank God for the leakers trying to get the Mob out of OUR WHITE HOUSE!!!
These guys are misunderstanding the problem! It's the secrets that are the problem not the leaks.
I think they should be given a medal. The guys mentally unstable and you should be doing your job in protecting this country not condoning
It's about time you stand up for something instead of constantly back stabbing the President ... don't be fooled by false approval ratings
What if it was @POTUS
Pretty sure the leaker has already left the building. Want to find the leaker? Check the list of recent WH departures.
I mean why would you want to hide the truth. Like if you were still running for Pres. you wouldn't love this leak. Leaker should be rewarded
What if it's Jared or ivanka?
looks like the most unpatriotic people I've ever seen responding to this. No matter what you think of trump, leaking is dangerous
Hmmm...it seems to me that it is @realDonaldTrump that is disloyal to our country.
What if #Trump WH wanted those transcripts leaked? Just so they can say, see, big bad media puts our nat sec at risk in wreckless ways...
Duh! Sorry, but leaking any citizen's private phone calls should be a firable offense - let alone POTUS.
It was @Reince . He got fired. Cc: @SenBobCorker
Shit, those calls aren't there good ones. We want the Putin calls. Mexico not paying for the wall is not news.
The leaker is TRUMP WAKE UP How much longer is it going to take to realize this President wants to be impeached trying to save himself & fam
He can't handle his approval is so low his son & son-in-law r being exposed he knows he connected to Russia so he's trying to get impeached
That's funny b/c i think we should have a parade for them and give them a front row seat at the impeachment. @LindseyGrahamSC @BobCorker
I hope trump runs another senator against Graham. Im over him, we need grassroots republicans. 
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity #Trump
Lindsey Graham and Bob Corker come election time you need to be looking for a new job
As much as these leaks reveal the real Donald trump and his incapability to lead. They needs to stop the leakes.
How do they know it didn't come from Mexico or Australia? 
I have $10 that says the leaker is Trump.
Oh please, just fire them? They need to be fined and jailed. A slapped hand is nothing.
Fire? Jail!
Thanks goes to the leakers. The world is in great danger and we should know.
It's McMaster, and I agree, who should be gone yesterday!
How do you fire the Mexican president? #freenieto
The ghost of Socks the Cat cannot be fired, nor can he be appeased.
Do you people really not get how important this is, if someone had done this to Obama you would be screaming.  Or are you just trolls? Sad!
They should be fired and jailed
Even his Chumps own staff despise him as a virus that must eradicated, the leakers are Patriots
Those transcripts should be public anyway. #transparency
So should OBAMAS secret birth records and unmasking hidden documents.  Such a double standard.  Leakers R felons and MUST be prosecuted!
Gee, I hope it's Bannon.
That's one way to look at it. I say, "Give the whistleblower, who proved Trump is a persistent LIAR, a medal. America deserves to know."
I question if they are even real ?
About freaking time of this non-sense!
They should be more worried about what he actually said on the calls #incompetent
right b/c we shouldn't know what a whiny little b#### we put in WH
Seems u two has something to hide wtf the people elected trump why should they not know what he is saying doing or thinking
True & thank God Obama is no longer in office.We know have a real Genius that keeps his promises, so refreshing. We love @POTUS #FIREMUELLER
Once again
Must be one of your republican friends who hates the clown occupying the White House at the moment!
You never know the leak was approved by POTUS to put him on the limelight!
THEN fire trump.
