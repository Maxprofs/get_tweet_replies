Wrong! Busy defending Israel while millions of Americans Healthcare is being taken away! DO YOUR JOB FOR US
Really. How much help will Israel be to us in a major war. We have alienated France , Germany and the United Kingdom.
ok. Let them stand up and take the lead fighting their own battle. No one wins in a nuclear war so does not matter who has them
your viewpoint. I am from a military family so I put my trust in our military not Israel's
NEEDS TO BE KICKED OFF US SOIL, WE NEED TO WITHDRAW ASAP!!
so you prefer to go to war instead of trying to reach consensus over issues. That sounds like an intelligent idea. Your kin first
ur perception is based on idealism..NOT reality
my perception of reality might not be the same as yours but it is not negated by your perception . Idealism is valuable
im purely stating the facts...the UN is a corrupt slush fund that promotes globalism & terrorism that causes death & trouble
your viewpoint. Does not make it true
my view is based on wut has happened thru history..ITS FACT
Why not tell Israel to get over itself and stop building on land it doesn't own?
2500 years ? Source ?
The Israeli settlements are ILLEGAL. Why do you support apartheid & oppression of the Palestinian people? $
They are not illegal. Israelis legally lived in those lands long before 1948 - and I don't mean in Bible days. A little research...ya know.
Again, what does ancient history have to do with current atrocities against actual people?
You're so silly! Historical & lawful you mean. I didn't say ancient history. Again, Jews resided in those lands late 1800s/early 1900s.
people forget the 900k Jews ejected by Islamic countries after WW2. No where to go
So doing the exact same thing to another innocent ETHNIC group is okay?
Muslims are not a race. Islam is the most imperialistic. Israel should take more
Palestinian Christians and Jews are also oppressed.
Ted, go over to Trumps office& hangout there, the 3 amigos are very bad luck, for all of us, especially U
@RealJamesWoods @LindseyGrahamSC @UN Ted you have finally grown a set of balls bravo
PLEASE DO!!!
@jcaroots @LindseyGrahamSC @UN -100% Agree!
What about Trump's comments on NATO? Dangerous!
@BeladonnaRogers @LindseyGrahamSC @UN Make the defending permanent.
*defunding*
. Absolutely!
There is a 1 1/2 state solution in the center. Go be partisan while your nation is ruined.
Shabbat goyim..who cares ...how about the billions Obama gave them # refund please
Democracy in action. Taking their football home.  @JnC2487 @LindseyGrahamSC @UN
Screw the UN. We need to get out & stay out. #UniteAndFight
@Jim_Peoples_ @LindseyGrahamSC @UN just cut off all funding to the UN and I won't believe it till you do it.
@sebastian1965 @LindseyGrahamSC @UN defund the UN!!!!!
Great job holding the one body designed with nothing but peace in mind HOSTAGE for your own pandering
Well stated. Let's keep our money and promote wars with nuclear weapons. That sounds a sane alternative to the UN. Right?
lying ted
MAGNIFICENT!!!

@LaurelCatherine @LindseyGrahamSC @UN I don't trust Cruz any more. He's bucking for something else. What's his Agenda???
'membr how he pretended 2B POETUS friend during Primaries until he wasn't ..u mean like that

@0Hour1Intern Glad to know @LindseyGrahamSC is doing something beneficial for #WethePeople for once. Abt time-we don't 4get @UN
.@SenTedCruz @LindseyGrahamSC @UN Don't be half-assed. Pass a bill to help them pack & hire a moving van.
Stop trying to impress anti-American Zionist benefactors. USA is your job not Israel.
We the ppl stand with Israel #StandWithIsrael OBummer has done nothing but hurt Israel & The United States
GREAT JOB @SenTedCruz !
Kick the UN out they commit crimes against humanity @SenTedCruz @Basquelady2u @LindseyGrahamSC @UN
And the blue helmets molest children.
@jca10c9 Much of Israel IS illegal & illegitimate. That's why I'm all for giving Israel LA (lower Alabama)!
how about Muslims in America declaring no go zones for our citizens ??//
@0Hour1Intern @LindseyGrahamSC @UN AbsolutelyU Both Need To SupportTrump& Should Not Undermine HimTyForUrActionToResolve
I like what Cruz & Graham are proposing on cutting UN Funding. But I still think they are nutty!
Thank you Senators for pushing back against the Oadmins antisemitic actions against Israel using the @UN.
<Settlements should not be built on the Palestinians land. @LindseyGrahamSC @UN
look up history ..it is not.our business to turn our back on allies..we have no businees
We shouldn't let our allies be bullies and unjust.
Awesome! You have my full support! Now go defund PP! #conservativesunite
Amen to that. PP has  some convinced that they provide health care to women.  Bull!
Planned parenthood does provide healthcare to women. If you have a problem with abortion it's your right not to have one.
ted shut down all foundations- they did it to trumps son, all theirs are illegal
way to go ted- thank you for fighting for usa stop Obama now- we have repubs in now
@RealJamesWoods @LindseyGrahamSC @UN The first time I've seen Lindsey Graham on the right side! He's normally a  complete idiot!
Thank you
@Arizonadog1 @LindseyGrahamSC @UN Defund the UN it is a joke.
@dennygirltwo @LindseyGrahamSC @UN I stand with you on this issue and please get the U.N. out of our country
don't be surprised when the UN moves to China.
What these grandstanding frauds will do is introduce legislation designed to fail.
@RealJamesWoods @LindseyGrahamSC @UN great news!!!
i hope that the they will vote to boot the UN totally out of the USA,  De-fund for sure,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tkBiFZBix0 … TRAITORS, Graham, Rubot, McCain!

AGREED
pull your gop.imple heads out of your arses
. " BRAVO SEN. CRUZ" !
@pennylanes5521 @LindseyGrahamSC get away from @LindseyGrahamSC Ted, he's a bad seed
working with @LindseyGrahamSC is proof that Sen. Cruz is willing to reach across the aisle.
. Good! UN should rereadad it's Declaration of Human Rights!
Good for you's!
GO CRUZ CUT THERE PARTY MONEY. HELP TRUMP MAKE ARE COUNTRY GREAT.
I think they should cut off funding for Lindsey Graham the closet Hillary supporter
Yes, Yes!! Please do!!
yep, better stay on the good side of AIPAC lest your campaign donations might go down the drain - SHAME !!
just cut it permanently...
just withhold funds from UN permanently. Give whole bunch the heave ho
good start.
If Palestine laid down arms=Peace...If Israel were to lat down arms= there'd be no Israel.  Hello.
thank god for both of you
Good luck with that.
Thank you sir! Keep this great work up.
@jamiepalks83 @LindseyGrahamSC @UN There are times I disagree with these two but they are warriors in DC working for the Ppl.
You should be cutting off Israel's funding until they truly want peace with Palestinian!!!!!!
@FoxNews @seanhannity ...excellent
@azblacksheep @LindseyGrahamSC @UN thanks glad your doing something Ted
right on, kick some A$$.
Amen! Get it done!!
Good. I fully support this measure
Proof is in the pudding. But nothing @LindseyGrahamSC does is credible now. He stabbed us in the back.
@UN
Ted Cruz ur an azz
The UN has solved NOTHING only started wars and kill jobs
@RealJamesWoods @LindseyGrahamSC @UN Brilliant and just!!! Do it!!!


Graham needs 2 be cut loose. we need conservatives to work together, he's not a team player
@RealJamesWoods @LindseyGrahamSC @UN #standwithIsrael
best of luck gentlemen. I wish you and the great people of Israel the very best.
Limp Lindsey & Lyin' Ted should sit down & shut up. Trump will let you know if he needs you.
there is a pair to draw to. Cruz Graham now who would have guessed. Living examples of required term limits
Ted u have just started 2 crawl out of the Hole u dug 4 yourself & u decide to partner w/@LindseyGrahamSC ?
Sounds great, but what happened to the legislation on reducing terms of Congress.
NO cure for stupid!
Settlements undermine the chance for peace. I stand with UNSC Res 2334!

HILARIOUS ! RUSH LIMBAUGH : Condensed Version Of Obama's Farewell Address - PARODY GOES VIRAL ! RUSH : Obama’s Farewell Is Already Forgotten 
@ConserValidity @LindseyGrahamSC @UN thank you Sen Cruz for your work!
here's a little lesson 4 all the terrorist Palestine supporters!
@ConserValidity @LindseyGrahamSC @UN it's amazing how ignorant supporters of terrorists are. Do a little reading!
This is good news
@RealJamesWoods Nice effort..question begs why permanent UNSC member, France represents EU.
Wow Ted got $391,814 & Lindsey got $388,000  From AIPAC- LOL #GoldStarDad  http://maplight.org/us-congress/interest/J5100/view/all …
Hold funding from Israel until they fixes the Palestinian Issue? Bet that would work better #GoldStarDad
Can we take it a step further & kick the @UN out of USA. We are a sovereign nation. They want to control us
@RealJamesWoods @LindseyGrahamSC @UN Is the UN even salvageable? Perhaps we should just let it die—cut funding permanently.
we need to defund UN & let it go off into the sunset.
@bensr_1 @LindseyGrahamSC @UN good make it permanent.
How about just on principle? Populated by anti-US dictatorships & terror sponsors.
@StlSerenity @LindseyGrahamSC @UN about time
@guidossss @LindseyGrahamSC @UN , ted love y f standing with Trump & f love America so much , glad Graham finally doing good thg
@RealJamesWoods @LindseyGrahamSC @UN your right I don't want my money going to those idiots
@RealJamesWoods @LindseyGrahamSC @UN we only had them for allies for over 20 some years!
idiotic guys, maybe think youself are the GOD.
Cut off funding AND kick them out of the US! The UN is nothing more than a criminal Cartel!
@RealJamesWoods Mr cruise doesn't your wife work for the UN????
Next, have them vacate the prime real estate in NYC. America can find better use for those buildings.
I'm starting to like you more Ted. Keep at it! You're in the right track.
cowards.
@limbaugh @realDonaldTrump Hmmmmmmmmmmm
We wanted money to UN stopped, but teaming up with Graham
has made it 'dirty' traitors!
How many Wars have they started or stopped. In charge of Human Rights-Saudi Arabia. SMH #uspoli #cdnpoli
Some good news at last.
Please just stop UN funding period. And evict them too!
The @UN & "The League of Nations" are both failures. We need to build a 2nd U.N. exclusively for Democracies!
.@SenTedCruz @RealJamesWoods @LindseyGrahamSC @UN Just make it permanent!  Get rid of the home of Tin Pot Dictators! #UN
@American1765 @LindseyGrahamSC @UN srew that, cut it off for good and evict them from NYC. They are no longer relevant!
Glad to see Cruz doing this/Muslim B'hood terrorist bill- Grandstanding vs results will be telling.
Nice you guys get some street cred for bold action!!!!!
don't stop there Senator, cut the purse strings entirely until the #corruption is weeded out
good

HILARIOUS ! RUSH LIMBAUGH : Condensed Version Of Obama's Farewell Address - PARODY GOES VIRAL ! RUSH : Obama’s Farewell Is Already Forgotten 
How did you get Lindsey out of McCain's ass for the photo?
Check into WHY and WHEN  the UN was founded/created. Morphed into the Political arena? Illogical members?
no need to bring @LindseyGrahamSC along to save his career.  #Termlimits
thank you Cruz for being real about who you are and what you stand for
I like Cruz better when he's not with Lindsey Graham.
There is hope for you yet, Cruz... but you have GOT to jettison the dead weight Lindsey Graham
you need to stay away from Graham. He's the swamp. And you are circling with him too. #Draintheswamp
So proud to hear
salute sir, Isrial is for Jews only,
No other settlement, on division, UN act like salafi radical group

finally Graham is involved in something I agree with. Where is McCain?  Probably plans to oppose
@CruzinAhead @LindseyGrahamSC Do It Now
The period should go directly after "the @UN ."  Full stop.
A just cause @SenTedCruz! Keep up the good fight. @CruzinAhead @LindseyGrahamSC @UN
Great! Thank Sen Cruz and Graham for supporting Israel
Wayne, that is excellent news! Hope it works to stop the UN partitioning of Israel.
Mr Cruz pay attention to what is happening in Poland, Obama is building up troops trying to start a _____!
ur traitors & that's a damn shame cause ppl listen 2 u! So the rest of the world has 2 do what u & Israel say?
@RealJamesWoods @LindseyGrahamSC @UN Just defund the whole UN! No more money!
The UN is a thing of the past. Get rid of it.
Defund UN PERMANENTLY!
@realDonaldTrump @TeamTrump @SenatorSessions @GenFlynn @SheriffClarke #Fl #NC #OH #PA #TX #AZ
Its about time
Someone tell these two that they lost to Trump and #Trump is the President.

broken clocks are right twice a day. just saying

@winatdelmr @LindseyGrahamSC @UN 
Don't turn your back on @LindseyGrahamSC 
He'll stab you in the back
Tell Lindsey, if he wants a war with Putin..go fight him himself! #Cage-Match
please, they are being pushed into sea and being threatened by surrounding states
Please kick @LindseyGrahamSC to the curb. He is a disgrace and we will primary him in 2018.
@RealJamesWoods http://youtube.com/watch?v=jYr5rc …
#TheTrueMajority #WeThePeople #DearMembersofCongress
Cut off funding permanently. IN will fold w/o US funds
@RealJamesWoods yes .......
#TrumpTrain @TeamTrump Sen.Cruz & Graham we the people agree with this legislation. Always #StandWithIsrael
turn the U.N. into a Trump hotel.
Good job Cruzer!  Like the way you supported the candidate for Attorney General! Stand up job!
Shouldn't we cut off funding to Israel for their illegal occupation?
@RealJamesWoods @UN 

why with @LindseyGrahamSC? Is there room for more knives in the GOPs back? #Gop #UN #MAGA #Israel
@RealJamesWoods @LindseyGrahamSC @UN  Thank you.
One thing Lindsey Graham has done right, lately.
What color heels did Lindsey wear with his suit today?
Lindsey Dont join this 'lying Ted' in what the whole world & 99% of american clearly see. Ted is a weasel!
Why not protect the USA from Russia and Trump instead of doing this right now.  Are you trying to divert our attention?
