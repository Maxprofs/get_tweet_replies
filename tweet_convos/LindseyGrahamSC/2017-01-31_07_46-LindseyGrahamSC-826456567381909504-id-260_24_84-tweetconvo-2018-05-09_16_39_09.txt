Clearly
@Visca1969
ohh pumpkin, you're checking out my profile? Have a great 4 years protesting, America is becoming great again!
Yeah, certainly looks that way: protests, boycotts, WH leaks, unconstitutional EO's . . . bang up job so far. @ForgottenBeauty
Super disappointed in what I heard. VOTE NO!
get in the back of bus! It's the GOP's time to rule this country.
Back of the bus? Well aren't you a predictable little moron. MUTE.
if u love the country, protect its principles & people.Dont just toe the line. 45 already dislikes you anyway #StopSessions
Your reelection bid is going to go bad for you.
I am watching. Your constituents protested outside your Mt P office yesterday. We said vote no on Sessions.
you people have no clue in what you're doing. Pathetic dereliction of Duty by the Democrats in the committees
there's going to be a few more Monday night massacres that I can assure you
DO. NOT. CONFIRM. HIM. #resist
... glad to see your still so passionate
where are you?? How are you?
I'm Still in Columbiana Al just right outside of Birmingham Al (I can see Russia from my house) Ha! Things are Great .
Please read JFK's book, Profiles in Courage!! U had a chance today to be courageous and vote NO for Jeff Sessions-coward!!
Don't allow these leftist to ruin you? There is no way to make everyone happy. But there is a way to stay in office. TRUMP
vote NO
I am amazed at the posts from some of your "constituents" especially last 2 or 3 AG's. Session yes
what is taking so long with nominations just quit stalling and call for a vote
Oh, you know Gorsuck?? I wonder if you guys have colluded to kill death penalty people. No, you won't get him. Sorry!!
Sessions isn't the person that representing fair & unbiased law enforcement. What did he do during the #BlackLives protest?
So how's that Russia investigation going? How can u NOT know Sessions brought Putin pawn Page 2 trump campaign? Ur a fraud.
Great!  Bigot as AG, Bigot on NSC-a Bloviated Circus Clown, White Nationalist President.  Just Great!!!
Guess party before country, after all, eh?
LISTEN TO US! You work for US so need to listen & vote NO on Sessions! He will do whatever Trump wants instead of his job!
Stand up and vote no! Cross party lines and do the right thing because it's the right thing
I'm sure a good ol boy like you approves of good ol boy Sessions. You probably get yr sheets pressed at the same place.
I hope you talk about the Democratic disgusting boycott of the financial committee. Gross dereliction of Duty
Dear Diary,
Super glad Lindsey still has no spine.
Wow. They really dislike Trump
Vote no
I know you're going to vote for him; be aware that we're putting a former supporter of the KKK in charge of civil rights.
I'm worried Sessions will only fan the flame of the increasing racial tension in this country. VOTE NO!
the tension is coming from the left most of us don't care I don't care I see humans we are all human
I'm glad to hear that you see everyone as equal.
so by saying your different and want different treatment it makes you different. This thought process is poisonous
people are asking for exactly that, I think we're crossing wires here sir. Asking for equality not for privilege.
it already exists is what I am saying and a lot of what I am hearing is that certain groups want more then others
you're suggesting equality already exists?
yes I am how can you say it doesn't?
you have FAILED the people of South Carolina 
Concerned about Sessions' views about immigration. #stopsessions
You can support your party by supporting other candidates who are NOT RACIST. RACISM? Can you say DEAL Breaker?
As more comes out about Miller & Beauregard input to ASSCUNT campaign, the more he shouldn't be named dogcatcher general
Senator Sessions views on the effects of the IDEA act are not acceptable. We need a AG with empathy.
Who the hell votes 4u
Ur a sissy girly lib w sounds like a 10yr old girl&am people despise you
Vote NO to racist, presidential yes man Sessions. Or don't you have the guts to do what is right?
Trump publicly lashed out at you and McCain! How much more abuse are you willing to take before standing up to him???
if you don't stand up know, everyone knows you never will.  Decide if Country > re-election. Good luck, Sir.
supports the architect of the Muslim ban
vote no!! He doesn't represent majority of Americans
What a disappointment.  The country voted for change not for unqualified racists.  Party over country.  Demand better.
Sir, please. Our country is depending on you.
No racist !
Vote no!  Trump had it in for you anyway.  Save your integrity!
youll be remembered for your vote, beware the public backlash
From an SC voter: Jeff Sessions will not serve in the interest of all Americans. Vote no.
will Sessons stand up to #BannonTrump or is he a large part of the problem. 
#Gender #Voting
Sir, if Sessions becomes AG, I hope the decency u see in him means he will also challenge the Immigration Exec Order.
May not matter who is confirmed if DJT is not removed & Iran, NKorea& Russia act because you don't act to remove Demented.
Sorry of you to support #DeVos unfit #Unqualified
Hopefully you're speaking about opposing him. Many of your constituents urged you to vote no on DeVos, as well. OPPOSE!
vote Yes on Sessions
Please vote NO now!!!
Greetings: Can you or any GOP Senator explain to us, who voted you into the majority, WHY Dems are seemingly being successful at blocking U?
Do NOT support him, sir. He is NOT someone to fairly & objectively follow the rule of law. You know that. Do what is right.
your defence of @JeffSessionsrbx, a racist, and your vote on Devos make it clear that your spine only goes so far up.
a vote for sessions is a vote for the #MuslimBan. What do you stand for?
He will not stop Donald Trump's illegal actions. Your trust is misplaced. Vote no!
PLEASE VOTE NO ON SESSIONS! He's in too deep with TRUMP. We need someone who has been able to stand up to Trump in the past
You are an embarrassment. I regret voting for you. Get off tv shows & do work for people of SC. WE VOTED TRUMP.
I hope you will vote for what is right & not approve this man who is unfit for AG. #StandUpToTrump
Your vote to confirm Sessions is disgusting.
Your remarks are heartbreakingly disappointing. Character counts.  Records count more.  I had faith in you...until now.
who do you think you are?? You are supposed to support our President!! DISGRACE Is what this is!!!!
So Lindsey Graham supports #MuslimBan based on his bite in favor of Sessions.
Block his nomination. He has too many issues related to race, religion and bigotry.
Vote no on @jeffsessions. He is too close to @realDonaldTrump to be independent.
Please stay true to America, not party. No Sessions, no Devos
you sold out our constitution and your conservative values! #NoSessions
do your job!!!! Quit blocking what will happen regardless
PLEASE DO NOT VOTE FOR THIS MAN! PLEASE! Comments to Yates are enough! PLEASE SAY NO.
# keep moving, you guys have been in office The people have spoken stop playing politics support Trump
# u have been in office too long stop dragging your feet and support President Trump
Please stand up and vote against your President. Stand up for your country not your party and not this President. Please.
Do the moral thing. Vote no on Sessions! #stopsessions
Good Tuesday, Sen.Lindsey Graham
Vote No on the racist Sessions and the unqualified Devos. #votersarewatching #dotherightthing
, 2020 is coming. Thought you still had a spine. Won't vote for you again.
Damn it Sen Graham...come on!  More than disappointed.@LindseyGrahamSC
,does Sessions apply his questions to Sally Yates to himself? That video in itself is divine intervention. His expectations.
, this isn't about ur friendship! & no, because Trump got in doesn't mean u tell ppl "it's too bad" if they don't like it.
Just Say No
midterms your ass is outta here!!!
Booooo
I'm praying a still small voice shouts "Warning!" to you. This isn't about party loyalty. It's about what in God's name is going on.
We told you "No" and you couldn't get Session's balls deep enough into your mouth, LOSER. POSER.
wow I thought you might have a molecule of integrity & honor but you talk and talk and then do the absolute wrong thing
Jeff Sessions is a good ol' boy southern racist. We can do better.
Sir: Thank you for your honesty and integrity. I don't agree with you on everything but keep fighting the fight.
vote no! #resist
why are you kowtowing?  COUNTRY OVER PARTY!
Your entire argument was "I like him, he's a good man." That's how you get a new person in Weds poker night, not the AG.
Yates had more balls then all of the Congress combined. Grow a pair.
Senator Graham got key points across. Now vote for Sessions and let's get on track as Americans.
Thanks for the opportunity to watch you shuffle papers & try to rationalize your vote for Sessions. Where's your integrity?
We expected you to vote NO on Sessions. Why are you caving? Country over party, right? Putin blackmailing u too?
Yes #putin has total control. Your next. PUTINPUTINPUTINPUTINPUTINPUTINPUTINPUTINPUTINPUTINPUTINPUTINPUTINPUTIN
we need someone brave enough to pull the emergency breaks on Trumps recklessness. Make us proud Graham
stick your talk up your nose. #nodevos
Sir:We the People ask you to review the Jan.6 CAC letter to you regarding Jeff Sessions being unfit to be Atty Gen-Vote No.
please #votenosessions
You can't oppose #MuslimBan and then vote for its architect's old boss and current de facto advisor Sessions.
VOTE NO.
vote NO!
The party of NO, whose only goal was to make Obama a one term president, wants courtesy from across the aisle?  NO
Or shorter, one racist southern boy talking about another racist.
How dare you criticize @repjohnlewis
You are again putting Party over country. Your friend is a racist. Vote No!
Please block him. Do the right thing here!  Please continue to stand up to Trump. Many of us Republicans have your back.
Stay strong! The American people have your back. @realDonaldTrump  #resist
no racist, no fascist please save us
If you vote to approve Sessions you will make a mockery of the Constitution and crack the foundation of the nation.
Please Vote No!!
vote yes !
Always one step forward, two steps back with you, Senator.
I must admit I incorrectly thought you would rise to defend the People's Rights, guess not.
NO NO NO NO  sessions..... slow this down!!!
VOTE NO!!
You are SOOO WRONG about hundreds of thousands being @ Right to Life March. Was only about 20K liar.
Vote No!!!
Please vote NO on Sessions. We clearly need someone who is willing to stand up for our legal system.
how will any of you syncophants ask questions while your tongue furiously massages his asshole. #RESISTANCE
you going to let him through knowing he will cover up Trump's dirty dealings this is the new Nazi party Watergate all over
Lewis was right. Palin took it there. John's description also fits 1/20/09 meeting GOP members and more. Truth hurts! DWI!
@postandcourier #NoSessions !!!
Don't you Dare vote for this man. You are supposed to be supporting the People that elected you.
Shame on you.
No on Sessions. Come on Lindsey, you know he is not fit. You are a better man than this. Keep your back straight and say no
Get a grip.we want his nominees in place immediately-we do not appreciate your games-you are going to be the most hated
again--you are such a disappointment, you are as delusional as trump.
.@LindseyGrahamSC Worse than the fact #Sessions' words & deeds have proven him a racist; will be if you don't have the integrity to vote NO.
The "Yes Vote" is correct.
please lead the effort to not confirm this man sessions #NoMuslinBan
VOTE NO!  Be on the right side of history!  You are one of the few voices of reason in the GOP
Will you PLEASE get on the correct side of history?  U know sally Yates is!!!
thank you for your notes on @SenatorSessions. I am not american, but I hope that he'll get the vote he needs.
looks like you may need to think long and hard about approving this man. Please do not approve...vote NO.
Your speech brought tears to my eyes.  I wish more representatives had your view and your heart.  Thank you
Vote no on Sessions!
you're living up to every low expectation I had in you. I knew you and McCain were just decoys pretending to have integrity
With respect: homo sapiens is hard-wired pro-life. Restricting choice is a thinly disguised attack on religious freedom.
Sessions supports the ban. By supporting Sessions, you support his ban. Shame on you, sir; darkest shame on you.
NO Sessions. He is dangerous for America.
. Please confirm Sessions.....  He will be great...
Do you deny the hate speech & symbols displayed at Trump rallies & his own? Thus if Sen Sessions stumps for him & against, he supports.
Hey, ever heard of REDMAP?  When talking about winning/loosing elections, don't forget how GOP has skewed the maps.
. @LindseyGrahamSC And after all of your tough talk. You're still just a tool. Your #15minutesofFAME are up.
If you don't stand up to Trump's fascist regime, you will find Congress changes colors in 2018!
your #s are false over 3 mil marched w little notice for wmns rights - half a mil prolife at annual march #sessions
You should be ashamed of your defense of Sessions & Palin. & McCain demonstrated abysmal judgment in picking Palin for VP.
He should have realized he would be tarred w/her racism when he tried to put her a heartbeat away. You have revealed yourself.
Just saw you choke on your words when you called Sessions and honorable man. Shame. What does trump putin have on you?
I disagree with your assessment of @jeffsessions. The man is strongly biased and does not agree with equal treatment under the law.
the only thing on fire is America 
Please don't let trump and Bannon burn her down 
Be a Patriot
Even though I respect you, I disagree with you in supporting Jeff Sessions.  He doesn't represent all republicans.
Jeff Sessions is a racist and he will bow to Trump or is it President Bannon?
Vote no!
Country before party every.single.time. History is watching, be on the 'right' side. Vote NO on every Trump decision.
you vote for him and you'll own it just like your vote for Trump
Jeff Sessions is not an honorable man, but I hope you win that Oscar Lindsey!
Do you deny caricatures of candidate Obama as a monkey, Muslim terrorist, in cross hairs, the flying of Confederate flags at their rallies?
Re-election is beginning to look less likely.
I believe that millions protest Trump!
@postandcourier we have been waiting for our AG, the President deserves his cabinet of choice. as a GOP we expect no less
respect
Vote no!!!!!!
vote no
Vote No
Now you're dissing John Lewis because John McCain's feeling were hurt??!!!
Disappointing #Resist #Illegitimate #Unfit #TrumpRussia #PutinPuppet #whinylittlebitch #Drumpf  #Crosscheck #Indivisible
please vote NO. Do you really think he can say no to Trump.
COUNTRY OVER PARTY. From a constitutional conservative please vote NO
vote no
@realDonaldTrump if we can hold Americans as enemy combatives maybe you should lock tRump up as an enemy #PutinLover
I tolerate you.
Always party before country, another spineless republican
Please vote no!
difference is supporters of Roe v. Wade aren't trying to take away rights of others due to unscientific beliefs.#NoSessions
Interesting #alternativefacts thousands marched to peacefully protest Pres. Trump - "missed the hundreds of thousands" on  March for Life
Do you want a military society Mr Graham? Jack booted thugs in a dystopian America? 

Vote NO on Sessions!
did you see the questions that Jeff Sessions asked Ms. Yates. take a look at the video
I usually appreciate what you do Senator, but standing up for Sessions is something I vehemently disagree with. He's unfit.
too bad! It's a YES vote for all of the cabinet and the dems can't stop it
$$$$ over country?  Vote NO ON SESSIONS.
Please Sir, oppose!
I am. Disappointed.
