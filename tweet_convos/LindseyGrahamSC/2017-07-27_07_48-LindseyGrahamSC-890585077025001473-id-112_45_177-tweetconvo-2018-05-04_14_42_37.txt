I would take it further.  There are millions of fine people in this country who don't deserve the treatment @realDonaldTrump is giving them.
Let's not make him a victim. Recusing himself was unnecessary. Caused big headaches that POTUS/country doesn't need.
If he's not helping the President in this climate where everyone in Congress & deep state is never Trump or hate trump, he goes! R U Pres.?!
Trump is a horrendous example for our young!
Women and the disabled are one thing but you start attacking a noted racist and that's where I draw the line!
Ha!LMAO!I really want Trump to have to fire him though.Thats 1 more obstruction charge.If he gets Mueller,thatll B 4 firings 2 save himself
"Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven." Is that your philosophy in "holy hell", Sir?
At least he's not getting it in the back! Prosecutor for Hilary and Clinton foundation
@realDonaldTrump When someone you trust makes mistakes or does not fulfill your oath, FRIENDSHIP, DUTY & HONOR must be inspected!
Nice. Well said.
What about the treatment minorities are getting from Sessions?  How does our closeted Senator feel about the attack on Gay rights?
Session is an evil prick but we want Trump 2 fire him so it can be used in obstruction case against him. If he does fire him&Muller,4 fired!
And maybe he does. WE voted for Trump. We dont want biz as usual so better figure that out before next elections.
Way To Go Senator Graham! Well done Sir.
Jeff Sessions made his bed when he put himself into the Trump camp. Karma.
So why didn't sessions give a head up about recusal since he was talking about it within hrs of being sworn in as the
Jeff Sessions is NOT doing what the American people want. We want justice for HRC. We stand with Trump not YOU!!
Recusal isn't some unforeseen issue 3 yrs into admin. Sessions knew it b/f taking job & wasn't candid. 1 Person--not 3--should run DOJ.
Even tho 45 might fire Sessions because he ceased to be a minion, the investigation likely will reveal less than honorable actions by Jeff.
He's not a fine man but he is just doing the job in the way a conservative would. How can conservatives tolerate a President bullying an AG?
Sessions is a Repub estab plant. Put into the DT camp to report back to estab repubs leadership. Same with Rice. Both want to take DT down.
2/2 Too bad you are not as outraged on behalf of everyone suffering at his hands. We are on our way to another Holocaust at this rate.
Not a fan of Republicans, even less so now, however, the way Trump is acting towards Sessions and others is repulsive!
He's trying to get him to quit! Firing would be perceived as obstruction. Bullying him into quitting IS ALSO obstruction! 
Hello?
If @jeffsessions is a fine man, he should be able to handle the criticism from the @realDonaldTrump
The president doesn't deserve the treatment he's getting from you. You're a traitor with an agenda.
Why r the O admin  corruptocRats, Barack,   Killary Clinton  Lynch,  Rice & others still walking  around free then?
Don't you get it #trump is not a loyal man. He has duped so many people did U honestly think he wud change. This is how he repays loyalty
Then let him resign. We stand with @POTUS He is NOT holding clintons and DNC accountable for their crimes. You are just as guilty.
The GOP supports Trump and his hate. No one is immune. You reap what you sow.
As we're finding out after 8 years of Obama. All his rotten seeds are subverting our govt.
As I said this is Trump undercutting everyone in his WH. The man is very evil.
This is an issue between the President and Jeff Sessions! Mr. Graham! Why not do Your Job before Advising The President on his Job!
As soon as Trump bothers to learn what his job REQUIRES. Everyone will be better off.Rules&laws apply to EVERYONE!Ur taxes pay 4 his lawyer!
You can't be Serious The Democrats and Former So Called President have been Lawless for 8 Years!
@MaryCaitlinByrd     ABSOLUTELY no one has demeaned Sessions being "fine man, conservative! Try listening to what's being said. Open ears!
@MaryCaitlinByrd @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Grow up! US AG Sessions knows what's going on w/POTUS a lot better than you do! Don't spread BS.
The President wants Jeff to do his job! The corruption in DC is out of control. Just yank the plug, and drain the swamp!! Jeff!!!
he lied! He's got to be held accountable!
Some are saying the same thing about you sir! That SC doesn't deserve what you are saying & doing! Fed Up with GOP!
AG needs to crush leakers and jail HRC or quit if he can't!
1/2 Then don't fight him on Twitter. Impeach the bastard, call up Amendment 25, whatever, it all works. Just get hm and crew OUT.
RINOs act like AG & FBI Dir have no boss. The rest of us thought there were only 3 branches of gov't--not 5. Support @POTUS
Don't like Sessions but no one deserves treatment like this. Deplorable, must less from our prez. Your courage is appreciated
you can get on Fox News and make a threat against our POTUS.  Now you need to be investigated.  What an example you are to American's.
Why is Sessions allowing this? This IS legitimate grounds for firing him unless it is corrected!!
Yes, yes he does. But the president's reasons are the wrong ones.
I'm sure Sessions is great, that's why Trump hired him in the 1st pl,I wld be disappointed too if person I picked is not there defending me
U have it backwards.Pres does NOT deserve the treatment that Sessions is giving HIM.Sessions shld NEVER recused himself PERIOD.We need tough
Thats what I'm talking about,
@LindseyGrahamSC speaks out of both sides of his mouth. He's a career politician, but not if #WeThePeople vote him out n 2020!
Although I totally oppose Jeff Sessions, if keeping him means keeping Mueller, than I'll take the poison for now instead of being shot!
Seems people actually believe what BS media puts out and they are clueless as to what goes on behine closed doors in DC!
You mean @LindseyGrahamSC and Sessions didn't know of Trump's mobstyle? and still drank the poisoned kool-aid. ?? What else did u expect?
Sessions is not a "fine man". He is a racist that lied to the Senate under oath. 

And Trump is a middle school bully.
What about us?
I don't even like Jeff Sessions, but even *I don't think the way he's being treated by POTUS is right! But I don't like anything POTUS does
Thank you Senator. Your integrity is showing.Hoping others will follow you
Senator, you do know AG Sessions' history, right? Don't think 'fine man' fits him. He's just now getting a dose of Karma - deserved.
and the president didn't deserve an AG that withheld information from him either. It works both ways Lindsey.
Hardly, he's a racist troll but bullying like Trump is doing is immature and narcissistic and beneath any employer.
Proud of you for standing up to what is Right.
Lindsey Graham if POTUS wants 2 fire Jeff Sessions he can, u Senators need 2 keep your word n do your job n stop telling POTUS what 2 do
Amen brother! If they can't do there job. I'll be damned if they'll do mine...
Only because he protects the GOP agenda and like you doesn't have the people that voted you both in, in that agenda, just power power power.
Jeff Sessions is a racist Keebler mascot but he gave up his career to take the AG job and Trump should treat him better than he has.
We should stop ALL friendly fires set up by some predecessors - smirking at America's internal feud
I bet REAL N Korea, REAL Russia, REAL Iran are smirking at how the friendly fire gives them advantages & wins they never should have gotten.
BECAUSE we need to focus on the danger of REAL WEAPONS;HOW CAN TOP OFFICIALS THINK STRAIGHT WHEN THEY CONFUSE REAL MILITARY WEAPONS WITH SEX
FOR ME WHO NEVER SAW 1 SINGLE PIC OF WHAT PHONY BARRY OBAMA MISAPPROPRIATED MY IMAGE TO SEND TO REAL TERRORISTS, IT's MIND BOGGLING THAT OUR
-  OUR GOD BLESSED NATION - WOULD WANT TO LET PHONY BARRY OBAMA DO TO OUR TOP LEADERS, THE SAME THAT HE DID TO TERRORISTS
EVERYBODY KNOWS PHONY BARRY HIJACKS MY DIGITAL CHANNELS TO FUEL TERRORISTS -- JUST TO BLAME ME FOR HE FEARED HE'S FATED TO BE LIKE HIS DAD-
OBAMA WAS ALWAYS PARANOID ABOUT HIS DAD WHO DIED A MISERABLE FAILURE -- BY HIS BOOKS
OBAMA WAS VERY DISDAINFUL TOWARDS HIS DAD - YET HE FELT A NEED TO EXTOL HIS DAD's ANTI-COLONIAL VALUES
Sessions deserves every bit of shit thrown at him & if it comes from Trump, his best buddy, even better
Tough.  He chose to support and work for an unhinged immature jerk and helped him become president.  He earned whatever misery that brings
Wonder what you were saying about Sessions befpre Trump's tweets.I wish I could tell you what I really think of you but  too much lady..
Agree...you cannot attack one of the few people that actually support your agenda.
1)TRUMP tweets 2) MSM sucks it in spins it & swings Liberal support 3) for Sessions!! 4)Sessions announces HUGE crackdowns with MSM support!
Y'all got use to the Club. Club time is over
I  Sessions & Trump! They will work it out! You ARE NOT our POTUS. You are just a "career politician" too long in DC. Get a job back home!
I hate Sessions and all the dirty militant things he does but the real trump is doing it I don't like!
Careful, @LindseyGrahamSC. @realDonaldTrump will start humiliating you soon if you question him. Just ask @lisamurkowski! Bully @POTUS!
HOW ABOUT THE TREATMENT THAT MUELLER'S CRONIES ARE GIVING TRUMP? HOW CAN YOU NOT SEE THAT THIS IS A BIG SET-UP?
I'm a Democrat that doesn't care for Sessions..but the treatment that Trump is giving him is disgusting. We do not have a President..#Resist
I get it,  and saw thru Trump, but they chose to drink the poison.
America is a fine country and great society that doesn't deserve the treatment that the president is giving it.
13,000.00 job trump is doing great!
Sessions needs to order DOJ investigations into Hillary/Russian mine deal & Comey/Loretta Lynch obstruction. If he does his job, no problem.
Umm....have to disagree with 'fine' man' and 'great'. He is neither. That said, he still does not deserve to be assaulted by trump.
Mr Trump don't take this wrong. You want a fighter you got in the AG. Just because he doesn't do fisticuff in public doesn't mean he is weak
Did you, Rubio, Christi, Cruz, McCain deserved it, @LindseyGrahamSC ? Why now?
GRAHAN YOUR A QUACK
I wish @LindseyGrahamSC would publically defend POTUS equally as he does Sessions. He has to be the 1st critic on TV to bash POTUS-WakeUpGop


SESSIONS NEEDS AN ASS KICKING OR RESIGN..HES EITHER GOING TO FIGHT FOR RIGHT IN AMERICA LEADERSHIP.DEMS. OR SCREW HIM! GET OUT!!
@LindseyGrahamSC is trying to usurp @POTUS powers & sabotage him! WE will not let you!
Sarcasm, right?
Thank you for clearly, and firmly speaking out...you just had to find your moral voice
Why isn't Sessions going after Hillary? Why aren't you?! Sessions is an estab mole to keep Trump in line & protect the estab. incl Hillary!
Your #TinFoilHat is cutting the blood flow to your brain! #Trumptard 
So, you're a Hillary supporter too? Her crimes are DOCUMENTED and prima facie. While there's NO evidence linking Trump to Russia. Wake up.
I just saw Lindsey Graham threatening the POTUS and the conservative patriots supporting him. Don't see many Graham t-shirts. Do your job LG
Threatening the POTUS....  Where do you "people" come from?! #Trumpism destroys everything it touches!
So was Comey, yet he Turned his coat Red, and has no Honor at all now. U R not in the WH, U are just spewing at the mouth. Talk, Talk, Talk.
I'm a far left much hated liberal (by the right) and even I know this is WRONG.Sessions is doing his JOB..I hate his policies.but it's WRONG
If Trump cured cancer liberals would find a way to bitch about it. All they know is resist
Graham, why did the Democrats not excuse their self during the investigations you get on there and tell the American people lie checkbalance
What are you talking about?
Sadistic like a cat playing with a mouse before he swoops in for the kill! #fakeprez
Lindsey Graham . if you have somethimg to say to POTUS .  public threats on fox news is not the place ..justice at the ballot box 2018 .
Bye Bye Lindsey Graham can't wait to vote you out!
Arrest Comey and fire Mccabe
If you come against our president for his decisions then you come aginst us senator. You wanna get the boot too? Keep it up...

So why are you all in congress not standing up to this   
I would so love to have her run for President! She is the best Senator we have bar none on the Democratic side! Let's see Rump attack her!
Racism and mendacity have never bothered Graham much. Manners (to the right people) are more important than moral values to him.
Wrong. He is a racist SOB and deserves all that Karma is delivering
Back off @POTUS
No one deserves Trump treatment of public demeaning including female GOP being targeted by Trump.
YES THEY DO..GROW UP..SESSIONS TO A PUBLIC JOB AND NEEDS TO SHOW PUBLICALLY HE CAN DO THAT JOB.OR HE NEEDS TO BE IMMBARRASSED BEFOR EVERYONE
Lindsey why don't you keep your mouth shut for a while and get some work done?
I don't like him but think he should stand strong
