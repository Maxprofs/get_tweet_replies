Witnesses? Undecided. "They'll be there if they want to."
Finance makes the official announcement on Cassidy-Graham hearing. Hatch says lawmakers wanted a hearing, so here's one.
What a joke! 1 hearing to scree 30m+. Does this make you feel like an American?

I cannot in good conscience vote for Graham-Cassidy. A bill impacting so many lives deserves a bipartisan approach. http://bit.ly/2xtEuvz  
Terrible #GrahamCassidy DEATH CARE!
We need Sanders MEDICARE FOR ALL bill that would give US true healthcare!

@realDonaldTrump

No conserv who cheers ripping away the insurance for babies born with critical diseases (for tax cuts) can EVER claim to be pro-life again.
Your healthcare bill is deplorable. Shame on you for killing millions of people by taking away their healthcare! You are deplorable!
Yeah, for a whole 90 seconds
That was a farce of a hearing.

@BillCassidy  is a liar
Traitors
Section 106.  Cassidy lies
WOW, an actual hearing with no CBO score? What the hell are you going to talk about. How you are screwing the American people?
@BillCassidy @SenateFinance @OrrinHatch
Koch Bribe $$$ is calling GOP 

A bill -- finalized yesterday, has not been scored, amendments not allowed, and 3 hours final debate -- should be viewed with caution.
Wow one whole hearing...how generous of the GOP. What a sham!

SCOOP with @rachanadixit: HHS secretary Tom Price has been taking charter jets to conduct government business. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/19/tom-price-chartered-planes-flights-242908 …
What crap. Never again can republicans talk about process
Why do you want me to die? I am a 49 year old mom/wife/cancer warrior from MO. I can't afford the projected increases. My life matters, sir!


One hearing?
Rs should refuse to recess until this gets a vote:Public sick of Rs missing deadlines

JUST OUT: Here's a summary of the Graham-Cassidy repeal. Yes, it's that bad.

Spread far and wide if useful.

Here is what you are doing to #Trump's base by supporting #GrahamCassidy. Not #MAGA!
#Trumpcare show everyone that the #GOP doesn't care about you, especially if you have life-threatening conditions.@LindseyGrahamSC
Charade...30 seconds of debate does NOT MAKE a hearing! #GrahamCassidy #BangBangYourDeadBill will kill millions #GOP driven #Genocide in USA

My letter to @BillCassidy explaining how his bill uniquely and disproportionally hurts his home state of Louisiana. 

This bill is being shoved through the Senate without hearings, a CBO score, or seeing the light of day. This is 1/6 of the American economy
Do you even read all of these comments??  Stop this! Fix the problems with ACA. Better yet, Berniecare!
No support on this. Don't try to shove a BAD #HealthCareBill thru just because you are a party guy. It's disgusting and wrong.
You and the republicans, including tRump are a disgrace to our country!
This is a cruel bill. You defile the Senate by pushing this to vote without bipartisan input and via reconciliation. Disgraceful.

My letter to @BillCassidy explaining how his bill uniquely and disproportionally hurts his home state of Louisiana. 
Screw Lindsey graham. Pretends to work for the people then pulls this crap. LOCK HIM UP
#GrahamCassidy would eliminate Medicaid entirely by 2026.

Not just the expansion. Everything.

Anyone who would vote for this is a monster.
Wow! One whole hearing!  Glad to see they are taking this so seriously.
#SHAME
I'm retired and not wealthy. We will work hard to unseat the voters of Graham Cassidy. Don't tick off retired grammas
Really? You want to give lots of money back to the wealthiest people in the country while taking health care away from the vulnerable ?

Poor @LindseyGrahamSC still wants to be loved by @POTUS #lapdogs
#StopTheRepeal people impacted from #Irma do not have power & internet, they  can't call/voice to their MoC
Graham went on Breitbart radio????
Just another white supremacist Republicon stealing your healthcare to line their own pockets.
Thought Graham was decent sure proved me wrong He & @BillCassidy are pure evil scum & will never b re-elected. They're pre-meditated murders
Please explain what #grahamcassidy covers w/o these "Essential Benefits," @LindseyGrahamSC?
@HouseGOP @SenateGOP House and Senate back to Dems - #2018
There. Is. No. CBO. Score.
How much would a family of three or four all with preexisting conditions pay? #highriskpools  tell us.
This bill will cover even fewer people than the bill proposed in July. Why is the Senate still trying to pass bad bills quickly?!
@LindseyGrahamSC lithe people of SC and this nation want & need #Healthcare. Stop representing wealthy and represent your ALL constituents.
It is sad that we need this level of suffering to prove single payer is the only solution.
CBO score says...educated guess is it's even worse than before
@LindseyGrahamSC Go Away! You and your Cruel Bill!
Why should they without the CBO score? Unless they only care about their own pockets. @LindseyGrahamSC are the worst type of person.
GIVE ME A BREAK WITH YOUR FAKE HEARING!  Where is the full CBO score- wait, your not waiting because YOU KNOW millions will loose HC #SAD

I thought you might have been different, shame on You! Taking away our health care protections while yours doesn't change! Shame on you!!!
Kochs/Mercers/The Kremlin own the GOP
Come on Graham pull the pickle out of your ass and get the CBO score already
https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/18/16330574/cassidy-graham-preexisting-conditions …  The sick, disabled, elderly and poor suffer the most with GOP bill that makes insurance more expensive than ever!
Sellout. #resist
https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/18/16330574/cassidy-graham-preexisting-conditions …  The sick, disabled, elderly and poor lose to wealthy GOP leaders by punitively paying more or losing coverage.
How can you do this to your constituents? Do you not hear our muddled screams calling out to fix this the right way? You have no soul.
Don't let them tell you there isn't any funding.
BREAKING: Senate overwhelmingly backs sweeping policy bill to pump $700 billion into the military.
Stop this, Lindsey. You seemed the only same member of the #GOP.
What is wrong with you 2 Senators? This bill is abysmal and you know it.
EXPECT CROWDS. EXPECT PROTESTERS. EXPECT US. WE WILL ABSOLUTELY NOT STAND FOR THIS MONSTROUS BILL!! SHAME ON ALL OF YOU!!

@LindseyGrahamSC @GOP YOU DO **NOT** HAVE SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. AND IT **WILL** KILL PEOPLE. WE WON'T ALLOW IT. GUARANTEED.
@BillCassidy @SenateFinance @OrrinHatch This bill does not add up, unless you are the rich 1% who benefits.  NOT #MAGA!
@LindseyGrahamSC @GOP IT IS UP TO **THE PEOPLE**, NOT YOUR BS YRS OF SLOGANS, NOT YOU, NOT THE RICH OR UNINFORMED.
@LindseyGrahamSC @GOP Since y'all think you're in Fascist Land now, let me break it down for you. WE. WILL. NOT. STAND. FOR. THIS. BILL.
@LindseyGrahamSC @GOP Y'all have 3 choices: 1. Work w/ Ds, fix ACA. 2. STOP w/ your AWFUL hc bills, leave ACA alone.
@LindseyGrahamSC My friend w/ cancer is literally ill w/ worry over this. AGAIN. You are actively hurting people. WE WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS
WTH is wrong with you?  People need and want healthcare.  Quit advocating selfishness.

NEW: Graham-Cassidy ACA Repeal Bill Would Cause Huge Premium Increases for People with Pre-Existing Conditions https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/news/2017/09/18/439091/graham-cassidy-aca-repeal-bill-cause-huge-premium-increases-people-pre-existing-conditions/ …
That does NOT count as full regular order. @SenJohnMcCain
How can a party of "family values" take away health care from millions in order to give tax cuts to the wealthy few?
How many other developed countries make poor sick people beg for politicians for their lives over and over?It is evil, cruel and wrong.
Congrats Senator!  You are the face of this cruelty.  It will be your legacy.
Patient groups come out in force to condemn new GOP bill to repeal ObamaCare http://hill.cm/5xruJ1b  
Shame on you @LindseyGrahamSC.  This bill helps no one and takes away healthcare from many.  Repeal for repeal's sake only.
a rushed hearing 2get mccain vote 4 bill that will kill people or cause them financial stress/illness at best. shame on all of U @SenateGOP

This bill is evil.  Why don't you guys just admit that medicare for all is the way to go?  So much more efficient and less expensive.
WHEN?
The American people aren't this stupid. We still know this isn't regular order. Why so desperate to destroy millions of Americans?
Americans should drop health plans if this horror passes. We should demand an end to payroll deductions for SS cuz we won't get that either
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenateFinance @OrrinHatch @TheDemocrats @thehill @AP where is the @GOP @realDonaldTrump plan to replace #ACA?
Why do you hate Americans? Stripping away healthcare from millions and you think that's a "good"thing? Disgraceful.
Are you insane?
I wish the @AmerMedicalAssn would hold a hearing on stripping Bill Cassidy of his medical license.
C R U E L    G A R B A G E
Lindsay, sometimes we love you. But this? We will hate you forever.

How Republicans Could End Up Being The Party That Solidifies Obamacare http://trib.al/X0To0wl  
This healthcare hurts seniors, mental health, addiction, children, women, low income. Hospitals, insurance, nurses are against this bill
This is murder with a pass card!And to think that I, w little experience in Health care insurance,can think of dozens of affordable care!
Well I've been in the healthcare field 17 years. It's why I built my website http://www.donaldtrumpnewstoday.com  to inform others
which shows we need to keep ACA and improve it and then, imo move to medicare4 all
So what?  Your bill is an abomination, and a finance committee hearing won't change that.  Tell me again how u care abt Americans. BS.
And Graham is back to Mr Hyde I see. Jamming in a horrendous bill. So patriotic.
Shame on you Senator Graham! This draconian bill hurts Americans. But power "Trumps" that now doesn't it? Party 1st...citizens be damned! 
Greed Over Party
I thought graham was one of the good guys but he really dont give a shit like all the other GOP menbers.  He should go suck on
Hey Graham, why do you hate working people, and why do you want to take away health care from Americans?
Why are you trying to pass a bill when the CBO won't have time to review and score? Expected better from you.
Disappointed  in @LindseyGrahamSC
Graham & Cassidy: I hope you will at some point in life feel the desperation your heartless bill would impose on others. Murderers.
Shame on this barbaric bill. Worse than the previous.  I thought Graham actually cared but  he is just as heartless as rest of GOP.
The plan sounds pretty good from what i've heard about it...BUT how do you plan on getting DISGUSTING McCain on board! That man is INSANE
Why do you want destroy the lives of so many millions of people by making it so much harder to get health insurance?  Shameful
Your bill harms your own state. Did you forget who you represent @BillCassidy? You are selling us out for political gain. #cassidylies
@OrrinHatch being a good Mormon surely will care about others including Gentiles. Or not.  Sen Pres Pro Tem might give him more jollies
Nope. He's a "good Mormon"because he pays his tithing as required. He doesn't care about actual "people" who aren't Mormons.
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenateFinance @OrrinHatch Lindsey, Lindsey, Lindsey. Who got to you? Someone got to you.
Thought graham was becoming more human but clearly with this disgusting rendition hat will hurt millions he hates his constituents and USA.
Shameful. Republicans are neo-Nazis intent on killing millions of us.

Fuck the Republican assholes.  They will get theirs. Inhuman jagoffs.
LA - Apparently Bill Cassidy wants tax cuts for the rich more than healthcare for his state.  Wow.
My letter to @BillCassidy explaining how his bill uniquely and disproportionally hurts his home state of Louisiana. 
In your dreams!! Media reports exactly 90 minutes will be spent on debate! You are despicable!! REPAIR the ACA!
Can't wait to see what yet another GOP disappointment will look like (CBO) when not involving bipartisan discussion and resolve GOP FAILURE!
Are you this idiotic 2think that American people will just except this? My advice if this passes,run like hell out of this country
Definition of insanity is what you proposes,consequences? You going 2face uprising like you never seen before. Like a snow ball
It's a sham, @BillCassidy
Determined to get the wealthy people tax cuts on the backs of people that cannot afford it.
But even Russia has universal healthcare!
Please withdraw this horrible plan. You are better than this
You playing with people life's, It's sick what you trying 2do to 20-30 mill people, maybe more since many people also will loose jobs





Disgusting. No CBO score, stops pre exist cond coverage will kill my son while Congress keeps govt paid healthcare SAD!
What a crock.  Our government is completely broken. @SenateFinance @ChuckGrassley @OrrinHatch
@SenateGOP. 90 SECONDS of debate time left. You're trying to pass a bill that effects 1/6 of the econ with no full COB and 90 secs of debate
SHAME ON YOU.
Unless they can show that they will be "obtaining information & opinions on proposed legislation" this is a sham.
