Giving the power back to the states is smart. Governors know their people far better than the federal government does. 
@LindseyGrahamSC should have read the comments on this before retweeting. Not seeing many in favor of the bill

I guess he would know more about it than just about every medical organization in our country that claims it's not.
How can republicans claim 2 B "Pro Life" & fetus has rights & needs protection while supporting bill allowing insurers 2 deny prenatal care?
Then don't buy insurance from them.
Problem solved.
What if ALL insurers deny prenatal care? How does your pro life stance balance with your obvious belief in Social Darwinism?
Then one company will decide to cover pregnancy, women will flock to them and theyll make a fucking fortune.
more likely that they will secretly conspire to rig the game with NONE providing prenatal care. Also, U never actually answered my question
It's purely far-fetched speculation on your part. EVERY company will deny prental care? This has never been a problem before.
and what of those individuals that have no prenatal coverage but get pregnant by accident... like 70 percent of the current pregnancies?
Will SOMEONE please answer my original question?
so does that mean...US congress should not pass any more laws?
@SenateMajLdr this is not a repeal. Do what you promised, FULL REPEAL!
Right.  How would he know?  Mitch McConnell is the definition of stupid.
And states will be quicker to find other things to do w that money. #VoteNoToCassidyGraham
When an entire industry is against something, shouldn't you listen? Pure politics over people. + Obama hate.
This is all about giving tax breaks to the 1% .  lets be honest here.
That's a laugh. Mitchell McConnell endorses. OMG - one of the biggest crooks in the Senate thinks the plan is "smart".
And it's a lie: @BillCassidy lying rebuttal to Jimmy Kimmel: ‘More people will have coverage’ - The Washington Post
Don’t believe this bullshit - They want deny health care to millions just to fund a tax cut for the rich and start another war somewhere
Since 2010, 82 rural hospitals closed in states w/ no Medicaid expansion. Repeal could close up to 700 in next 10yrs
And he's more of an expert than @AmerMedicalAssn, @AARP and the Medicade Adminsitrators in all 50 states?
BREAKING: The bipartisan Medicaid Directors from all 50 states just issued this negative statement about Graham-Cassidy.…
The states have no money! Nope 
Except Lindsay they don't want it listen
Smart for crooked GOP Senators who want EZ Koch , and are willing to KILL innocent Americans to get it!
Not when it destroys Medicare for elderly people in nursing homes.
It's not smart. It's evil. It's not even a healthcare bill. It's a gift to insurance companies & it raids Medicaid.
Keep 90% of O'Care taxes & regulation in place & reshuffle dollars among states is NOT a repeal. NO GOP ran on this.
#GrahamCassidy is fake.
none of these bitches PAY for their own health care...this is nothing more than pass the buck, "we need a win" acts of cowardice & treason.
HYPOCRITE! What happened to no cornhusker sweets from June? Donors happened. READ Pg 95 & yes Cassidy is a LIAR.
Complete nonsense
What kind of CRAP wouldn't you vote for? Page 95?

Mitch McConnell is an idiot.Millions lose cover & costs skyrocket for everyone else. Ends Medicare.Disabled, seniors, women, vets lose cover

#BREAKING: All 50 Medicaid directors come out against GOP bill to repeal ObamaCare http://hill.cm/h25skCt  

You know who's smart? The American Academy of Pediatrics. They call this bill a "dangerous, ill-conceived policy".
I used to think you were one of the few Republicans that actually gave a damn about people.
Well who the hell trusts Mitch McConnell?
mcconnell is a dotard fer sure
And we're supposed to believe Mitch McConnell.
If your death bill passes #GOP dies. So I guess even the worst dark cloud had a silver lining. SHAME ON YOU.
So disappointing you are party over people.
Then why are so many GOP governors against it?
Are you all delusional or just @GOP stupid & corrupt? 
That's odd, every major medical org opposes this steaming pile of 
Wow shocking because they will lose profits
That tells us all we ned to know. It is a bad bill!
I am ruined. I have a pre-existing condition & now insurance companies can raise my rates such that I'll never be able to afford care.
This means he has literally signed my death warrant.
And I'm a small business owner.  No "group" insurance for me.
You've taken my life.
BS!  If you pass this my S-I-L who has three boys under the age of 7 and was diagnosed with lymphoma last year will be screwed.
Can you explain why the Medicaid directors from all 50 states are against Graham-Cassidy? @LindseyGrahamSC
Who cares what the Turtle says - He is so deep in the Koch pockets. Screw these spineless simpletons!

Red states will not limit policy underwriting and Lifetime Caps. In 10 years the states will begin Crazy taxing due to end of fed grants.
NO!!! MILLIONS WILL LOSE THEIR CARE!!!!! DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!
Smart? Well, maybe it's politically smart in the near term but not in the long run. As far as good healthcare--not smart.
Why don't you debate someone younger?  Like @SenKamalaHarris & @RepJoeKennedy... Afraid
Mitch McConnell is a thug & has criminalized Congress. He & Ryan deserve the  45 is flinging at them.
Smart if you want to keep getting money from the Koch bros. 
Oh god. Now we know it sucks. #GrahamCassidyDeathBill
Not a compliment, sorry. @SenateMajLdr  would say *anything* that opposes ACA is smart.
Please call the Senate to demand a halt to this idiocy! Our very lives are at stake! 202-224-3121 #GrahamCassidyBill
And in the meantime, the ranks of those horrified keeps growing   #KillTheBill
@SenateMajLdr What a den of thieves @GOP are.They don't care about the suffering of so many. #KillTheBill

Seems @GOP has a lot at stake  Party of Greed #POG




They said corrupt and deathly,  not smart #GrahamCassidyNo
To late
It isn't "smart" .. it's mean spirited, hateful and shameful .... https://twitter.com/jwilson_detroit/status/910339902944022531 …

Big surprise. GOP's plan to repeal Obamacare for everyone except Alaska is likely unconstitutional. #GrahamCassidy http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/09/repealing-obamacare-for-49-states-probably-unconstitutional.html …
Why doesn't anyone call this what it is, another tax cut for the 1%.

If you want to know how great the Graham-Cassidy bill is for states, the bribe for Alaska is that THEY GET TO KEEP OBAMACARE!!
Most dangerous men in the world: Republican senators
Too bad the governor
Doesn't sound smart to these folks.

Lindsey; you are blowing smoke up the American peoples' butt; you know this bill is wrong!!! You know millions and millions of people loose
Each state will have to set up its own exchange, and with less money because Trump's rich friends want their taxes lowered. Disaster awaits.
Racism. Only wealthy white citizens will have insurance.
Mitch so right so often.
Ohhh it must be true if Mitch said it 

#BREAKING: All 50 Medicaid directors come out against GOP bill to repeal ObamaCare http://hill.cm/h25skCt  
well EVERYONE in the healthcare industry not the political SWAMP say the opposite
http://ktul.com/news/connect-to-congress/health-care-industry-groups-line-up-against-graham-cassidy-bill …
No it is not and you know it!!! Develop a plan that actually works, or pay the price at the polls!!!
You are having to use Mitch's measuring stick of "smart"? Damn, it must be true #grahamcassidysucks
It is smart...for rich republican donors that want their tax cut. For sick ppl, not so much. Dead poor folks don't matter.
The old talking point. Sweet.
#lyinlindseygraham

#BREAKING: All 50 Medicaid directors come out against GOP bill to repeal ObamaCare http://hill.cm/h25skCt  
Well, at least your new Trump "do" matches your screw the Nation attitude Mr. Graham
The looks on those men's faces say it all. "We are full of shit...and we don't care nothing for the people",Thanks for nothing assholes.
But nobody outside the @GOP does - so maybe Mitch is wrong on this too,
"To date, not one major health care industry or advocacy group has expressed support for the Graham-Cassidy plan."
http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/19/obamacare-repeal-backlash-242903 …
Your killing us here. Listen, this bill will destabalize the health insurance market for ALL of us right now. YOU KNOW THIS!! , be a Human.
The AMA says not. I think they know better than these guys.
Smart for Koch Brothers not American people

#BREAKING: All 50 Medicaid directors come out against GOP bill to repeal ObamaCare http://hill.cm/h25skCt  

All 50 Medicaid directors oppose Graham-Cassidy! Your plan to decimate Medicaid is unveiled for the American public!!
Shame on you.
Youll be ok.
"Daddy, did mommy really have to die from cancer to support "federalism?"  Sweetheart, Senatir Graham said so. That makes no sense, Daddy."
Do you think they really believe the bull they put out or do they see the people as that stupid? Either way, they need to be horse whipped.

Smart if the only goal is to replace Obamacare. Even if it is a bill that will only continue hurting hard working American families...
The loopholes are glaring in this bill. Designed to screw the American people again yet benefit special interests #PeopleOverProfits #VoteNo
That means nothing.
No CBO score, I guess could be considered smart, no way to definitely prove how many Americans will be kicked off of insurance
Governor Christie doesn't agree
@SenateMajLdr And states have the right to hose people on healthcare.
We care because...............?. This involves us not Mitch - his opinion does not matter.
Can't trust Lindsay Graham one whit.
If McConnell thinks it's smart, then it is another failed attempt, at a socialist government imposed program.
Congress should not have better health insurance than the taxpayer Americans that sent them to D.C.
Yeah, no.
I want every dollar back that I've paid in taxes..every penny! #REPUBLICANS are lining their pockets! Sold our country to Russia! #Thugs
Both sides are lining their pockets many times with the same people's money. Even Obamacare was written by insurance companies...
I prefer it to this proposed bill but both sides are guilty of lining their coffers with special interest money/putting profits over people.
Uh, no
Yea coming from a corrupt turtle that pretty much sums up who they plan to f!ck over. Bought & paid for.
False premise. Medicaid was designed for state control. Fed gov had to put in 75+% $ incentives to get states to meet minimum standards.
This bill is not smart per American Medical Association. Snake oil salesmen of the GOP
Yeah, let’s all start searching for things that McConnell finds smart, the dinosaur backs Trump at every corner, he’s not beacon of hope.
You are all !
I wouldn't even be able to stand in fr of Amer. peop. With this poor of a bill. SHAME.


GOP wants that Koch money at any cost.  Kochs are billionaires.  How much $ do they need?
Killing #Americans is what he does best. 30 million at a time
...and I approve this message
Of course hopefully you will kill what's left of the Republican party.
Right. Just as @realDonaldTrump is, "like smart." #LyingSacksOfShit
Not smart, greedy.  Deathcare. You are murderers.
Well, yeah. He's Mitch McConnell, the turtle man. That doesn't make it a good idea.
Do you think you are smart, Caitlin? If you do, read, learn and if you're not a sociopath like Lindsey, then weep: http://bit.ly/2fzRYwh .

McConnell and I disagree on almost everything. So I am have serious reservations about this.
Gonna kill a lot of registered voter Lin
These two morons are clueless @SenateMajLdr  @SenateDems
It's the same thing with different name making it worse
Oh, please.
GOP doesn’t want to lose Koch $$ so will vote for Graham Cassidy.
If you're playing politics, I think that's true.  If you want a health care plan for Americans, you'll work in a bipartisan committee.
Kicking responsibility down to the states does not mean coverage. Subsequent withdrawal of HC funds to states is murder.
Smart must be old white men slang for LIES.
.@LindseyGrahamSC I remember the times you were actually "smart" enough to not destroy 6th of our nation's economy.
.@MaryCaitlinByrd Just to be clear, that was a response to @LindseyGrahamSC
https://www.facebook.com/aarpfl/posts/10155826582958680 …
Only smart for your donors! Thanks for selling us out! #DarkSoul
#BREAKING: All 50 Medicaid directors come out against GOP bill to repeal ObamaCare http://hill.cm/h25skCt  
Good thing the democrats aren't owned by donors. Lol
You forgot the part where you give the States billions less dollars to do it and give that money to billionaires in the form of tax cuts.
Sometimes the word bullshit just doesn’t do Linsey and his little buddies justice.
Keep in mind that Mitch McConnell is an idiot.
@SenateMajLdr has proven time & again he is #hyperpartisan

Mitch McConnell? lol. The meeting of the pathetic old white men has come to order. They all agree with each other. Go figure
It's called a circle jerk!
You call smart kicking millions of people off of Insurance raising premiums stripping away Medicaid & eliminating pre-existing conditions?
But it or don't buy it. Your choice. Maybe people with 10000 deductibles can actually use their insurance now.
Why do you keep lying @BillCassidy @LindseyGrahamSC?! #MedicareForAll  #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
Oh, #WeReadIt. Section 106 allows states to waive underwriting req's. Insurers could charge through the roof for preexisting conditions. 
So why are so many governors against it?  Hmmmmm???
so maybe you guys need to listen to the governors
they don't like it either

who likes this???
Why do you hate kids @LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy #GrahamCassidy
Avalere, a consulting firm, modeled Graham-Cassidy's cap on Medicaid over time. Look what it does to children and the disabled. SAVAGE. 
What is your definition of "smart"
He would. He is of the same (screw the middle class) mind.
Go to bed, Blanche/Lindsey.
There must be some money in it for pimp McCain , or Lindsey Gramnesty wouldn't be pushing it
Yes, because when I'm looking for someone to confirm, "smart" the first place I head is McConnell. #Godlovescarriedintrest
The same state "leaders" that do so well on roads, education and ethics, right? Laughable at best. It's only healthcare, no biggie.
Graham’s plan is what a dumb person thinks smart plan looks like.
This is the same guy who thinks the KKK is a misunderstood group of boys. #HardPass
