The UN is countries from all over  the world, What do you intend to do?
Let the rest of the UN countries support it. Take back USA funding dollars of the  UN
And the USA will have to leave the UNSC and won't havea say anymore on security.
without the money provided by USA, security council is worthless anyway!
I am not 100% sure of that. On what information do you base yourself to say this?
we will be exiting the UN soon. But,will renegotiate a better deal for America.
Deplorable!
You are complicit in Israel's slow genocide of Palestinians.  Look up legal definition from 1948.
This is why congress will continue to be hated. I did not for Netanyahu as my Senator.
I did Not Vote for Netanyahu. He doesn't get a say.
Stealing Land is ok with you , the Repulsive party.
sir, how many times are we going to bail them out for breaking international law?!
In the World war against radical Muslim fundamentalism,  is America's best ally.That's priceless.
yah it looks it, like how Israel has treated the people of Palestine for decades
There is no such thing as a "Palestinian people". Also, 1.5M Arabs willingly live in .
hahahah yah okay, no wonder we have the issues we have
Your self-professed love of football has clearly caused you to have sustained multiple concussions.
concussions don't erase facts, nice try
Israel is on front line in the War against terror, which has swept into US shores.
What do you expect from a party that voted in an admitted sexual assaulter, bigoted, racist ,con artist. Nice.

Well, at least you're doing that. Not sure why you are trying to delegitimize a GOP presidential victory, tho.
Please back this up. Please show the UN does NOT speak for the US with their agenda
You need to.educate yourself. It is not moral for Israel to build in Palestinian Territory.  @LindseyGrahamSC @netanyahu
Melinda these hypocrites hate for the sake of hating law means nothing 2 them, boarders mean nothing to them, agreements mean nothing 2 them
borders?!
No kidding. UN doesn't respect borders

Where you been of 8 years? @Netanyahu
How much of our 38B is going into his pocket?
It is not an outrage. It is correct. Israel needs to STOP all settlements and give back land buildings an infrastructure
when are the voters in SC going to get rid of this rhino clown. Let's see how he pretends to fight...jerk.
AIPAC making the rounds Lindsey. Must obey your masters.

When I last checked President Obama is the President of America not the illegally Appointed Trump,& not BIBI.
sheer madness - Suggest you read some history written by M Dyan and Y Rabin.
introduce a bill to defund that joke of UN. Why its budget 22℅ of USA money? That's our money . Pull our money.
It's far more outrageous that the USA rewards Israel's incessant spying with $38bn in military aid.  #BDS
Obama should be impeached, indicted, convicted and imprisoned for international war crimes against humanity.
God gave the borders and boundaries for Israel. Noone can change that Beware those who try and fight against God
Awful lot of tweets from you about Israel/Palestine today. But what are you going to do about this:
mmmm#ł
Anti Semitism has found a new home in the modern day Democrat Party.  Harry Truman is rolling over in his grave.

Perhaps @LindseyGrahamSC & @netanyahu Forgot the 7 times REAGAN abstained from an Israel–related matter! Read this: https://sethfrantzman.com/2016/12/24/abstaining-from-history-heres-all-the-un-resolutions-on-israel-the-us-abstained-on/ …
really Lindsey GRAHAM....YOU PPLS IN CONGRRSS JUST TELL LIES TO KEEP THE POWER...I AM GONNA TAKE IT
@tedcruz @netanyahu Move the UN to GITMO... PLEASE!!!!
Not fair to GITMO terrorists to sit them next to UN. Cruel and unusual punishment !
Thank you Senator for your steadfast support of America's greatest ally.
Bebe is a bully, trying to push Palestine out of their land. U r on the wrong side of this MrGraham.
why let the tail wag the dog? Bibi should NOT rob land & get away with it. US cannot be blind @LindaSuhler @netanyahu
Read and study your History since your understanding is as muddled as your brain.
Not an outrage but a reasonable effort to reign in settlements.
please BB I would like u to do an episode of Undercover Boss in Gaza with Graham by your http://side.You  may learn alot
get cucked turkey-neck
Thank you, Sen. Graham. Your moral sanity helps keep this #Hanukkah bright and hopeful. Merry Christmas to you.
YES!! It must be reversed or USA should leave the UN
They have no oil or natural resources why are we even over their.
Israel also tries to steal our secrets if they were a friend this would not happen.
u say they are I greatest ally in the middle east. But what have they done for America but cause us problems?
Israel has not fought any wars with America Ben-Gurionn ever sent troops to Korea. Stop kissing up to Israel.
We are the superpower we should not bow to the Israelis. Israel looks out for Israel. There not our friends.
Netanyahu is an ass,doing no service to his or our http://country.You  do not steal property from others.
Senator as you know Israel could use Help as a face saving measure I am with your idea. Wishing you all the best
Lindsey, SC voters should remember you always pick Israel first NOT US first. What payoffs do you get for that?
I hope Obama does what Carter has asked: recognize Palestine as a nation. Start diplomatic relations.
this is stupid! How r u still revelant when 99% world know Israel is wrong? I hope the wrath of God come 2 u
Netanyahu is a terrorist. The most evil terrorist besides Trump, GOP, & Putin. This alliance IS an AXIS OF EVIL
It is clear. You have been bought! There is nothing moral about those settlements.
Bibi wants to keep stealing land from the Palestinians. Trump, GOP, and 1% wants to steal Muslim/Arab oil.
This is one con that I am totally sick of, this lie, using the Bible wrongly, to align with atrocities.
him then you mustn't want peace in that area. Mr Netanyahu knows he's doing wrong. Do you?
A book, the Bible, sadly has been the cause of EVIL atrocities against others, especially Palestinians.
Israel is breaking the law continuing to build the settlements WAY BEYOND the agreed border. If you agree with
that's our national policy. Put US interest first.
stop supporting Israel. They are not interested in peace and defy international law.
Maybe they should stop STEALING

You should not be siding with terrorising child killers.
@jchr5667 @netanyahu  
and how far up his hole dud you reach?
. Just dump the UN. They've become an extremist organization
Another stupid reborn that believes that all Jews should end up in Israel so the messiah can return... 
@shonnarobinson @netanyahu why?
U hve noticed we hve voted out LOT OF DEMS-when DJT takes office-STARTWORKING W/HIM or we will vote gop out then
can we arrest obama now? impeach in 11th hour? bho has been NATIONAL DISGRACE& gop congress let him run amok
please remember #Biafra
@tedcruz @netanyahu please remember the Jewish of west Africa #Biafra. Buhari is killing #Biafrans everyday. Please help
Dated someone from Israel - loved him - but friend referred to Palestinians as "animals". PM really for peace?
Maybe u should take hard look at history. Many ppl of Jewish faith abhor settlements.Ruining any chance at peace
@tedcruz @netanyahu thank you for standing with Israel
can you educate yourself on this? This is a horrendous situation by the Israeli people. Follow the treaties
@coinabs @netanyahu I doubt you'll see Trudeau support Israel. PM S Harper always did the right thing ahead of politics
Hi - On the historic situation - a must read The UN has it all wrong! http://www.shamrak.com/Masada2000-HistoryofPalestine.htm …
thank you for your support of Israel, America's true friend in the Middle East.
you should push back even harder 3B dollar's given to Israel and start to feed 13 millions hungry  U.S children's
I hope you and your colleagues will reverse this craziness as soon as our soon to be former president is gone
@TOR_ONT_O @netanyahu Good tweet but wish you would stop hitting on Trump.
thank you senator graham for supporting Israel. We look forward towards a new vision after Jan 20
why do #US congressmen have this #Israel fetish? Wish you would try that hard to keep US out of other states' territories.
They are in the promised land they don't have to grab more land
Those people might not be white I remind you God don't see color
How is supporting occupation Godly?
You held the bible in one hand and slaves in the other hand
Your families pushed hard to keep slaves you now push hard for occupation
Stop being jerks.
There needs to be a 2 state solution. You can make Latkes and they can make pancakes. And EVERYBODY eats.
you need to behave and stop throwing temper tantrums.
I would be pissed off too.
house and took over EVERYTHING and would not even let me make pancakes in my own house that you took over.
That doesn't seem fair to me. I would not like it if you did that to me. 
I would not like it if you came to my
In your kitchen? And tell you that you no longer have rights to ANYTHING? You cant even make pancakes.
your house and just post up? encroach inch by inch until one morning you wake up and I am cooking pancakes in
So, what you're saying is that it would be totally ok for me and my tribe to come and set up shop around
@FoxNews @JMfreespeech ~Bibi NOT POTUS>JUDY PRES JOHNSON DIDN'T KNOW WAR WOULD B ONGOING COSTING US TRIL's~
What about the people who can't tell a #Democracy from #Fascism and just put a psychopath into power? HUH? @GOP
hope he is not putting all his faith in someone like Lindsay graham
Israel has hijacked many in congress with lobby $  http://maplight.org/us-congress/interest/J5100/view/all …
and you stand for Christianity?
I hope harder than u pushed back on Obama
No Senator, Israel is violating the Oslo Accords and pointlessly stirring up Palestinians with these settlements
hope so but fear many will cowardly buckle remember S. Powers once urged Military force ageist
Israel if this stand and an other Obama type will have international legal reasoning 2act
prays and peace to Israel I tremble for my country for God is just on that happy note good day
@petpanther0 @netanyahu This has to be a turning point in history. UN forcing nails into their coffin.
@zlando @netanyahu  "If it has not been the Lord who was on our side,now may Israel say " Psalm 124:1
So Imperalistic don't you think!
Thank you sen Graham!. @potus embarrassed the US.  standing with Zion & US. 
You forget the people who are being pushed out of their homes for this. Bibi doesnt care about them. Please!
We Give Israel Billions Of OUR Tax $$ & THEY Have FREE HEALTH CARE & Abortions NO Problem Giving Out $$ For That
He has gone outrage at shameful level, he is not accepting @UN @UNESCO What he wants ?
Senator Graham, I wish you would be patriot enough to protest Netanyahu's unconscionable remarks about our country's president.
Israel can do far better than their Dick Cheney warmonger.
Israel is an important ally. But we can no longer stand by while Israel commits human rights abuses and refuses to stop settlment expansion.
2 times he has done good things!!@seanhannity @PrisonPlanet @KyleWRowley @LouDobbs
you are just making more people dislike Israel and their settlements, and risking more regional violence. Peace.
.@LindseyGrahamSC @holdem00 @netanyahu oh my gosh I agree with @LindseyGrahamSC #isreal
Merry Christmas SENATOR on this Holy Night, Silent Night, Nativity of Our Lords Birth, Christ the King is Born!
Need yo defund you @LindseyGrahamSC
Netanyahu is leading Israel downhill. Listen to his moderate countrymen http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/editorial/1.761142 …
so out of touch with all your other allies, pity decisions revolve around dirty Bribes
Fuck that! Stop selling out your own taxpayers to Israel! 38 billion for what?
Tw@t
<--It's about time you got on the #TrumpTrain, took you long enough! @netanyahu 
#MAGA #SupportIsrael
in the meantime let the Christians of Jerusalem die & harassed for practising Christianity ?
They should all push back hard. Why wouldn't they?
Good, there are millions of Americans who agree with you.
Are you and @realDonaldTrump itching for a U.S. Civil War? You're playing with. Israel doesn't get blank checks
I'd be surprised if it was this Senator who's done nothing for last 8 years
Are you a US Senator or a member of the Knesset ?
Please don't back down.  No more false red lines.  The UN went too far and Obama betrayed our friend #israel
Thank you for supporting Israel!
Appreciate Senator Graham for standing with Israel.
You're part of the swamp @realDonaldTrump plans to drain. Can't wait for term limits to send you back to "private practice"
In simple language: As time -> infinity, ur ability to dictate terms -> 0. @_AfricanUnion #StandwithSenegal
@_North_Carolina @netanyahu 
I do not like you Lindsey.
Make it so.
#defundtheswamp @unsc
@WeThePeople4US @netanyahu Enough! No more UN! Dismantle it!
Somebody please remind Lindsey that he is a US Senator @netanyahu #NotMySenator #AmericaFirst
@Poptartmom @netanyahu @realDonaldTrump I'm sure Bibi had rather heard from DT or Kellyanne than LG.
TELL HIM MERRY XMAS FOR US. THANK YOU
Its the first sensible thing the Un has ever done for Palestine.
Palestinians are a hoax. They support and fund terrorism
No they fright against the oppressive Zionist invaders from Europe.
what about our border
You mean a vote by 14 to zero, with only US abstaining?   
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-38429385 …
Israel has minions in Congress-Senate to do as told. Obama disobeyed Netanyahu's orders but Trump will obey
So this confirms you're for a pro-apartheid Israel .
Are you an Israel-first senator?
lapdog
u should resign from the United States Senate and move to Israel and  kiss netanyahu Ass in Israel!
netanyahu is the person who came to your congress and said Sadam had weapons of mass destruction.
let netanyahu come to congress in enbrass the POTUS. Israel only things about Israel we don't follow Israel.
u need to go to Israel if u are down with Israel. Israel has done thing for America but cause us problems.
We completely support you in this!  Defund the UN & no more aid to any who supported this.
now imagine if a US senator unilaterally had this conversation with the leader of any other country...
@tedcruz @netanyahu. Obama was reprehensible, not representative of majority of the people in the US, we luv Israel
@sams_usa if you follow this clown I won't be following you. A pity.
settlements get in way potential 2 state solution GOP always party over all If was Bush Trump celebrate abstain
Needs to focus on Russian influence on elections, Nuclear proliferation, DT chaos. stand against Trump.
You will both dangle from a rope in the #Hauge for crimes against humanity. #BDS #Fact
get the heck out of the UN !
Enough is enough. Both side share blame, they (Israel) needs to be forced to the table!
The only reckless in here is you Senator . How much money did you get from the Jewish Lobby ?
how about you worry about the US (and SC) and let Israel and Palestine sort out their own troubles? http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/the-un-resolution …
Amng the permnent mmbers of UN Security Counsel is Russian. Notice #Trump not complning abot Putin's vote!! @RealTrump2016
Is there any reason the U.S. Senate shouldn't formally censure Obama for this atrocious action?
Lindsey get real Israel deserves to be admonished for their fascist behaviour
is it a democracy where the majority is exiled and cannot vote
dhame on you and others loke you
I don't remember your outrage when Russia invaded Ukraine but anything against Arabs is acceptable
thank you
did @AIPAC make you do it? Are you against 2 state solution now?
Would love to see members of Congress outraged,going above,beyond to address US Gun Violence epidemic.
@anneinpt @netanyahu honestly, you'd better. What America has just done will be much worse for your people than for ours.
what obama did is too late but better than other sorry as* politician who are just giving lips service
the US has been saying no to illegal settlements for 5 decades and israel has been building i.s for 5 decades
Yeah? Now the whole world is against illegal settlements and you try to threat them with money?
Graham, usually YOU'RE part of the problem too.  But in this case, you're right.  #IStandWithIsrael
