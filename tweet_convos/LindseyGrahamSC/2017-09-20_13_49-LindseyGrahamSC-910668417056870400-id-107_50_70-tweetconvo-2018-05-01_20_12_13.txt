Tim Scott is a vile person.  #KillTheBill
No surprise. Tim Scott does exactly what he's told.
They used to call people Traitors for 
voting against their Constituents interests
Being A traitor to an entire country
is worse than that!
@SenatorTimScott take a guess on how many South Carolinians your vote will condemn to an early death because of a pre-existing condition?
He doesn't care, will further racist @realDonaldTrump 's tax break instead of healthcare for his constituents!! 
Will South Carolina control health care the way they controlled teacher/police/fire pension system?  Absolutely not!!
Time for this man to go and get true representation in place.
I appreciate him speaking to Trump about his racism, but Scott puts country over party by supporting the #GrahamCassidy Trumpcare nightmare.
@SenatorTimScott how can you do this to the people who elected you. they may not vote for you a second time. live and learn.
Didn't the first time. Will actively help his opponent this time.
Of course. Neither of you care about South Carolina residents.  You care about money in your pocket and the government healthcare you get.

Of course he will.  Always the follower.
What concerns me is the veterans that are so overlooked in receiving quality care and are falling through the cracks
Of course he will.  He has to be on that train.  Hoping to be president one day.  Never going to happen.
@LindseyGrahamSC 
you are no Pres Reagan 
or Sen. Hollings! #GrammRudman cut troop size, didn't funnel $$ into it. #IServed #USAF #Veterans
And we will vote them both out.
has he read the plan? Does he know how many will be harmed?  How much is he getting from donors for this present
SC senators care about nothing except party lines and money, Graham and Scott are worthless to our state and country!

@realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP @SenateGOP 
Real reason for betrayal comrades is Koch donors. Soulless RatBastards!
Of course, he will further the racist @realDonaldTrump 's agenda instead of standing up for the people of SC who need healthcare!
And as our state is dying so too will the poor! We have far too many of them!
of course he will....he is a good lil soldier.
Sucks to be him as he's not going to be reelected if he continues to support this train wreck of a bill.
Why is his race relevant in this (or any) context? Why not: "Everyone that votes for (Miss) Graham will vote for this sidekick," yes" man!"?
What demands that all states must cover pre-existing conditions for all times? And at what cost?! You're going to spike rates. LIARS
Graham--I AM SO DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.
WHERE do you read this garbage? WHERE do you read this garbage? WHERE do you read this garbage? SHAME on you @skropf47
Let's be clear here -- it's a tax cut for the wealthy - your MOST IMPORTANT constituents. And you are doing it on the backs of the poorest.
@b_sodone @postandcourier Senator Scott doesn't like poor people, sick children, the elderly, healthcare if you have money to pay.
Idiotic. You ought to be ashamed
I wonder how much $$$ goe$ to $enator $cott's bank account? @SenatorTimScott
BOO~HISS~~C'mon Senator~~Do the right thing. Oh it IS the "right" thing~~~
So how much is Senator Scott's share of the Koch loot?
Wonder no more. The Koch donor network will give GOP $400M for 2018 *only if ACA is repealed* & tax reform passes https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/26/koch-network-piggy-banks-closed-republicans-healthcare-tax-reform …
Lives will be lost if this passes. And it will be on you.
You're an embarrassment to your state. Resign.
What a bum!
Not sure why this is news..
Andy Slavit
The American People will remember

O course  he will  political whore Sad  he could have been a role model for young people in SC but i guess he would rather be a puppet
He had either no reading skills or just a follower. No backbone
Of course he will, on someone's payroll I'm sure. I won't rest until they are both out of office.

Damn you Tom
If you take my health insurance I will die.
Ummm duh
Color me shocked!
Scott wants his Koch money.  Who cares if poor people don't have insurance?  Vote RepubliKlan
Sad

Hope he gets voted out when all his constituents start to die without proper health care - sorry Sen Scott you suck.
What was he promised? And who swallows? Graham, Cassidy? You are vile little white men that only by force & lying can u 'do' anything
Tim Scott is an idiot. He'll do whatever Graham &trump tell him to do. He is the epitome of a useless politician.
Of course he will.  He us nothing but a lackey.
What a good soldier.   Look forward to everyone getting their coverage of 6 ft of earth
Quel surprise. They're both party tools. How can you justify the racist president, @SenatorTimScott ?
As a SC citizen, @SenatorTimScott and @LindseyGrahamSC I implore you to find a better way!
They don't listen to constituents, I've tried, all I get back is BS, we have to vote them out, weed be better off with no representation
Yeah, he's a damn fool. This bill only puts the hurt on hard working American families yet again. Just like those before it, including Ocare
Sounds stupid.The states shouldn't have that power because some states will take advantage of this and the people will suffer.Should be same
SHAMEFUL. TRULY SHAMEFUL.
Booooooo these men! Shame on you! Protect the American people.
Tom Scott doesn't care about his constituents if he votes yes!
NOPE
Too weak to stand up to @LindseyGrahamSC and trump
@LindseyGrahamSC @postandcourier bye bye Tim. Don't cry when you are voted out. You will rue the day you opted in favor of this.
I mean. He'll do literally whatever @GOP leadership tells him to do at this point. It's actually pretty sad.
Fucking monster
He obviously hasn't read the bill - or doesn't care
A free-for-all on pre-existing conditions, premiums for aged, etc.
Boooo hisssss
Another R putting party over people. Imagine that.
No words
Really ,voting for another swamp RAT!
Profile in Porridge. Gooey.
Well I sure hope so!
Shame on them all. Zero respect!!
Duh!
Of course he will. Has he ever voted outside party lines?
Surprising no one.  Why is he there?  Yes man.
