You are voting in Russian sympathizers with Tillerson and not getting Comey out of FBI. Shame on you, Sir.
They never came into our election you qwack!...they only exposed the truth!...big difference!
@Amplitude350Lee @LindseyGrahamSC So why approve Tillerson's nomination ? Have you been offered a piece of the pie?
...but then he votes to confirm Tillerson.... terrible
Punish Russia, @LindseyGrahamSC ? With Trump as Pres and Tillerson as Secretary of State? 
#alternatefacts #NotNormal
I'm sure confirming Trump's Putin-approved nomination of Rex Tillerson will help with that... bigly
Yet you will vote for Tillerson to become SoS. You have no credibility.
Congress had 8yrs to punish all the cyber attacks, but wimped out. Why didn't you push something though?
Is there anyone in the United States that hasn't figured out Lindsey Graham is mentally ill?
Punish Russia by impeaching Trump
u knew he was going to lift sanctions on RUS a$$hole..4 $500B oil deal..what was your cut
THEN WHY ARE YOU BACKING TILLERSON?! HYPOCRITE!
they get scared when the truth gets out.
So why not send a strong message to the world?  Why would you vote for Tillerson?
Too late, The Russian  sanctions has drawn China and Iran closer.
Best 2 reach out to Russia #Trump is right
Then WHY are you & McCain voting for a man suspected of Russian ties? No confidence in either of you anymore
explains connection btw RU  in GOP, illegal settlements& Aum Shinrikyo
Still waiting on that proof
Umm China was involved for Al Gore. Getting senile in your old age? RINO #TermLimits
It's up to you and John McCain to save us from the Russians.  No one else is in a position to do that
If they expose the corruption of one of the candidates, so be it. If they spread lies then that's a problem
@BaileyPittipat @LindseyGrahamSC But he still supports Tillerson.
Punish Hillary and CNN for sharing debate questions and colluding to oust Bernie and hiring goons to disrupt DJT rallies
It’s not just elections. World order is changing & you’re letting it happen. Selling out America/democracy.
Translation: "And they might not come in on the GOP's side this time."
This is just more bluster and in the end you will do whatever our Russian made pres. tells you.
unlikely, but what if dialog led to new Russian policy on civil rights? We should try but be wary.
@bulldoghill @LindseyGrahamSC yet he just said that he will confirm Tillerson. That's not how this works!
hacking is the new war. We need better fiber security,  will be impossible to stop a tweet or Facebook post.
As if the EEUU hasn't meddled in other country's politics... Nicaragua,Guatemala,Chile,Arg, Bra,...
and tillerson will help? why would he when his economic bread was buttered by putin?
agreed
STOP trying to get us in a war with Russia. Shut up and get to your ass waxing appointment.
What the hell is confirming Tillerson do you think we are stupid!!!
They already do.
that should be for @POTUS to initiate w/ zSec Tillison
@AndreaChalupa @LindseyGrahamSC then let's set the example for those who do? Is Graham thinking it's OK?
@AndreaChalupa @LindseyGrahamSC But Lindsey just said Tillerson will get his vote, so he surrendered to Russia.
You punish Russia by de-legitimzing the puppet he put in place. #illegitimatePOTUS
And with the other side of your mouth, you announce support for Rex. SHAMEFUL
GOP just wait,sit down w/PresTrump&get best course fm THIS POTUS! Sanctions fm ObamaAdmin.not valid anymore!
GraHAM needs to be watched push him out
We've been hacked for 8 years. We need to update our dated cyber security & build respectful relationships
Russia helped Trumps get in. Period. Not with their votes but in changing mind of people on the fence. Period.
ONLY PROOF, SO FAR IS RUSSIA EXPOSED INFO FROM PODESTA!! IF THERE IS MORE---SHOW IT OR SHUT UP
Russian hacking/false flag news. HRC deserves sanctions for STEALING our primary>real evidence exists.
Rexy will be very strict with Putin, I'm sure of it. @fakedansavage
Sir, a vote for Tillerson is a gift to Russia. They've proclaimed it in their media. Sending mixed message
Will America ever escape the box political hacks like you & @SenJohnMcCain keep cramming #USA into over&over
This is the kind of thinking that unites. Isn't about party, it is about security
Lindsey.....where ya been. Hacking is not new!
Sen u'd better get to work on your new boss. Appears to BE A RUSSIAN at this point. Putin/Trump bromance.
Lindsey is a RINO.
Better run this by DT first Lindsey, sure his Secretay of state will conquer with your thoughts
Bernie says he spoke to a "psychologist last night."  He needs one 
IMPEACH THE TRAITOR....THE EVIDENCE IS ALL THERE!!!  GET SOME BALLS!!!!
what evidence
.@FaceTheNation @LindseyGrahamSC you've gotta deal with bullies, harshly...or you'll create a space for MORE bullies...
