Why not get together with Dems and Fix whats wrong with ACA? So HELP our Country Dont Hurt it
Becuz it Political... it can't be said Demos saved Repub. HealthCare.. their lookin at 2020
#trumpcare not really Healthcare Were forced by ACA otherwise there would be nothing
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer If the ACA collapses we'll remember who wanted 'collapse' over 'cooperation' to make ACA better.
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer ,  Graham is a 100% correct.  Let it collapse and then replace.  Blame non-supporters of Ryan plan.
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer 2words #BuyersRemorse , u cant listen2ppl justBecuz their on TV or over a party! #CharacterMatters
@LindseyGrahamSC Stop being so spiteful; your constituents want you to help fix it; not let it collapse! U R EVIL
So, you've given up on your so called "full proof" plan to repeal and replace and quit? Ha ha ha
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer Disappointed in this comment.  Thought you were better than that!
,  Don't blame all republicans blame the misguided ones and democrats.
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer just figure out the nightmare & fix it in bipartisan manner w/out destroying health of citizens
Just shows what a sociopath you are. A political win is more important than the good of the people!
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer Preserve and Improve sir.
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer We're Gonna Repeal & Collapse your career & Repeal Your Health Care SAVE THE ACA OR GO AWAY
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer the only thing that needs to collapse and replace is the GOP
 Have you even read HR 676 yet?
Hopefully you will collapse and we can REPLACE you Senator. #VichyGOP
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer you just don't get it and your letting us down
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer Shameful!
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer Shame on you. Without GOP interference, Obamacare will be just fine. Improve it. That's your job.
first explode and replace the Illegal POTUS
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer Republicans can only destroy, never replace, let alone create!
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer Becuz they don't care abt All Americans! Yeah Replace with #Nothing U Have Nothing! 7yrs.
NO.. we want to IMPROVE upon Obamacare!!  Wake up!
Sad but this is the best strategy Sen. Graham is correct !!!!
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer you mean SABOTAGE and replace with something shittier so we can give tax cuts to wealthy.
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer during his term of presidency. When will people hold Trump accountable & STOP shifting the blame!
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer saying... Let America drown. I think conservatives forgot that it is the President's job,
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer This girl has lost respect for conservatives to say, let ObamaCare collapse. No difference than
You do realize @LindseyGrahamSC that we can repeal and replace you,.........don't you?  FIX OBAMACARE NOW!
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer
Magic is science the @GOP Doesn't understand but Russia does. @FBI @GCHQ  “The Prestige” by @DameJEMarshall
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer @alweaver22 so you want your constituents to lose insurance and die? Your evil
How'd that work out??
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer it this talk that will make this his LAST term
@RiseUpAbove @dcexaminer Graham can use his calm preacher voice and tell people he cares-he doesn't. Remember, he leads the GOP.
RT THIS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer childish Sen. G. by all mean truly PICK UP YOUR MARBLES GO HOME N STAY THERE.
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer THAT doesn't sound good 4 Americans. Stop thinking about just 1 group. Real live people at stake.
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer take charge sir. Mitch us too passive. We need a leader. PS don't thrash out POTUS though ..please
@GOPoversight How is it legal/ethical for @IvankaTrump to be an advisor to @POTUS with security clearance?
My choice would be to repeal and replace all republicans like @LindseyGrahamSC who don't work for constituents.
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer nothing new about #GOP direct sabotage of #ACA
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer Fuck Graham
Graham says " We Will ALLOW Millions 2 die Because WE NEVER had a plan to offer"
The GOP Russia tactics.
If the GOP allow Obamacare to fail opposite of what Americans want they will pay the price in 2018.
so now he wants to  fix it?
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer - Invite the worlds best healthcare advisors to a summit MTG. Find out what works. Universal HC
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer There you go Dems fault the GOP couldn't do this in 7 years!#SAD
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer or actually govern & come up with a good plan. But destroying lives for political gain is good too
apparently you've changed your tune a bit
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer @alweaver22 How about just fixing it. Egos
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer For the good of the American people,why "collapse?" This is an OPPORTUNITY for bipartisan work NOW!
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer But how long will that take? How many more ruined? Why can't we ram things through like Democrats?
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer don't be foolish, when repeal n replace not happening, REPAIR is ur path, collapse=death 2 millions
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer truly a man that is thoroughly vested in the prosperity and well being of ALL Americans
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer Good luck with that
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer Jackass!
Lindsey is the best...under his plan more free visits to the proctologist and tapdancing lessons
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer Republicans had 7 years to write a good health plan, where is it??
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer republicans currently control house, Senate, white house and have a split scotus. All on you now.
My plan vote back democrats into power so they can fix this in 2019
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer Work with the Democrats and fix the ACA for the American people. Stop being obstructionists.
he cant, a  jackass is alwaus a jackass, never will be a horse
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer 
Idiot. CBO analysis reports ACA works. It simply needs to be reviewed, FIXED & supported. #SaveACA
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/cbo-report-insurance-market-death-spiral-obamacare-trump-2017-3 …
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer. 1. Travel ban  2. Healthcare plan 
Vile and full of utter disregard for humans. For CONSTITUENTS.
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer Genius idea. Come on. Step up. Actually do some work.
What an utterly cowardly thing to say..and incorrect.
