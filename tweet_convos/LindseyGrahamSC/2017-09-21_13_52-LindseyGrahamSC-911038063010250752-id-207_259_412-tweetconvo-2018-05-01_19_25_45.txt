All progressive Statis.
I'd rather lick my dogs asshole than watch CNN for more than two minutes. It's the most time I'm able to stomach their liberal propaganda.
Don't do this Bernie  @SenSanders , no need to now.  Dems have a chance to come to the table and negotiate. This can't be all or nothing.
To talk about how their barbaric bill just died?  Cool  @SenJohnMcCain @lisamurkowski
If Graham&Cassidy just show up and attempt to justify this bill I will recommend them for a posthumous Emmy award.
@cnn @CNNPolitics you are enabling the destruction of our legislative process. Debate belongs on senate floor, not reality TV. #Shame.
More evidence #GrahamCassidyBill is a piece of crap. Perhaps you find that term offensive, https://twitter.com/thehill/status/911036343664484352 … @BillCassidy @Lawrence
#BREAKING: All 50 Medicaid directors come out against GOP bill to repeal ObamaCare http://hill.cm/h25skCt  
This is a bullshit attempt to make this bill "normal". Zucker wants ratings, not truth. Not watching this crap!

#BREAKING: All 50 Medicaid directors come out against GOP bill to repeal ObamaCare http://hill.cm/h25skCt  
This is not a constructive conversation.
@SenSanders As a democrat, I'm begging you, please do not do this. This will only help GOP
Great! Maybe Sens. Graham and @BillCassidy can explain why all 50 state Medicaid directors oppose their bill?
Please have lie meter running: @BillCassidy lying rebuttal to Jimmy Kimmel: ‘More people will have coverage
Sir- Didn't you call "Buying Votes" Crap just a couple weeks ago?  Would that now be considered a lie? #GoldStarDad
Why oh why are you hell bent on killing elderly, disabled, poor, children, vets, ppl chronically I'll?! You need to rethink your position.
How much money do the Koch's donate to you? Super PACs? Just destroy every good thing Obama accomplished in spite of GOP. Shame shame shame
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN healthcare is all about the tax cuts for the wealthiest Not about healthcare,healthcare providers against
The Liars @BillCassidy @LindseyGrahamSC vs the Truth tellers @SenSanders @amyklobuchar
Why? You will let them lie, call no one out, throw softballs and give a bigger platform to push #GrahamCassidyDeathBill WE KNOW IT'S BAD.

I hope Bernie Sanders points out the flaws & the lies the Republicans are telling the American ppl rather than trying to push his own agenda
BREAKING: Nuclear codes revealed!

Nuclear code = #GrahamCassidyBill

#NuclearCodeGrahamCassidyBill #NuclearCodeGrahamCassidy #SaveACA
Wrong people.  We are not debating single payer.  This is what it's about:

Republicans need to give up their idea of ripping off our health insurance to line their pockets and kill us all!
@cnn give us a f*cking break with Sanders he's so old he was at the last dinner 
Debate @SenKamalaHarris &  @RepJoeKennedy
You know what!! We all fucking get old doesn't mean we've stopped thinking, living, speaking. The attack on elderly population must stop!
Let others do war with these guys
Is spewing anger Kennedy or someone could tone him down some & so you hear what is being said instead of blah blah blah! Bernies passionate
Harris also had Jeff Sessions wicked nervous at a gearing recently. Imagine what she would do to these guys.  It would be magnificent
It would be spectacular if a woman could take these guys down!
Bernie will repeat the same things. Many ppl say his timing encouraged this new HCB. Should have waited until. October. I'm JS
Will @donnabrazile have the questions in advance to pass along?
Senator Graham, u are trying to buy Lisa's vote for healthcare by exempting Alaska from cap. I can't tell you how disappointed I am with you
So? Not interested in #GrahamCassidy lies & propaganda. Also, very little interest in Sanders socialism.

#SaveACA it's better than DEAD

#BREAKING: All 50 Medicaid directors come out against GOP bill to repeal ObamaCare http://hill.cm/h25skCt  
Who gives a shit about @SenSanders when @LindseyGrahamSC, @GOP and @POTUS don't give a shit about us?
That will be interesting
@nytimes Who Would Ever Think Kremlin Putins Money Could Assimilate @POTUS @SenateGOP @HouseGOP & Weaponize the US Democracy Against Itself?
All Medicaid directors issue warning on new Graham trumpcare bill. @nytimes @cnn @washingtonpost
3/that being said,positive intention of Dems railroading the ACA:Healthcare for all. Positive intention for Repubs railroading trumpcare:$$$
Use this chart.... w/Kimmel in it, of course.
You're gonna get your ass handed to you. Better cancel.
You look like a good guy but your not - you are just as bad as the rest.  A Koch employee
Everyone already knows you are doing this because the Koch Brothers are closing the piggy bank.  Has 0 to do with American citizens.
HealthCare in America means begging your senator to save your kids lives @LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy #KochBrothers
Great Filibuster answers 
Debate @SenKamalaHarris & @RepJoeKennedy instead. Bring it on.
Does anybody think MCCAIN can accept best buddy Graham turning out 2 be HUGE LIAR? MCCAIN'S honorable,Graham isn't.Selling ROTTEN goods.

If you want to know how great the Graham-Cassidy bill is for states, the bribe for Alaska is that THEY GET TO KEEP OBAMACARE!!

NEW: 579,000 #veterans among 19m who lose Medicaid under #GrahamCassidyBill: https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/news/2017/09/20/439277/coverage-losses-state-graham-cassidy-bill-repeal-aca/ … #ProtectOurCare #Handsoff (w @rwest817)
Hey @CNN how about you add @CoryBooker in that lineup?
@LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy Weasels in human form,
bottom of the barrel..
Blood sucking Koch vultures..

#BREAKING: All 50 Medicaid directors come out against GOP bill to repeal ObamaCare http://hill.cm/h25skCt  
BREAKING: ALL 50 Medicaid Directors come OUT AGAINST Graham-Cassidy. ALL 50 STATES...LARGEST Health Insurance provider in the country.
Who will the moderator be?
Why sanders?  This is going to turn into a stunt where they debate against single payer. Why Sanders??  Go away @SenSanders
Maybe they can talk about why 5% of the population accounts for 50% of health care costs. Or why 20% of working age males 25-55 on Medicaid.
Why does Congress have better health insurance than the American taxpayers that sent them to DC???
No wonder there's a shortage of tomatoes and eggs....
Help me understand why Sanders and Klobucher are positioned as advocates of ACA. This seems like them aiming a torpedo at ACA.
Guess Graham and Cassidy will actually have to read the bill this weekend.
I'm getting tired of this circus show. We need public hearings and professionals to have their voice. No tv debates; @cspan for hearings.
Love 2 see lyers get what's coming to them so looking forward to watching you go down in debate flames. 
This is a bad idea. How about putting some Dems on the panel? @TomPerez

CNN: Your town hall meetings are a joke!
I think this is a dumb idea for Dems.  Don't make this about G-C vs singlepayer.  We need middle ground, bipartisan plan.
Why do you hate kids @LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy?! #GrahamCassidy
Avalere, a consulting firm, modeled Graham-Cassidy's cap on Medicaid over time. Look what it does to children and the disabled. SAVAGE. 
CNN is against your health care bill... Liberal Lunatics obstructing
Trump's a #dotard. Lindsey is an aging southern belle. SAD!
Why do you keep lying @BillCassidy @LindseyGrahamSC?! #MedicareForAll  #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
Oh, #WeReadIt. Section 106 allows states to waive underwriting req's. Insurers could charge through the roof for preexisting conditions. 
Oy Vey
Liars Inc.
CNN townhalls are just amplifiers of nonsense. Remember the one with @SpeakerRyan?He promised an undocumented mom she had nothing to fear? 
Invite Jimmy Kimmel
Never trust anything said on CNN
Now that's something I would watch. Hope the moderator will be fair and uninvolved in trying to tilt outcome!

This is just a ratings grab horserace to @CNN, but people's lives depend on the #ACA. Shame on you for giving us this POTUS, too. #SaveACA

PATHETIC!

Bring out the gloves.
Look forward to it
Good!
The pieces of crap and a lady
Well don't make it one side and where they get to pick all their questions I say put Andy slavitt on this let him ask questions lc
Good get to see how these two leftist will continue to bash top 1% and promote free this and that its all sham sanders is a nut job
one extrem 2 another. country will never C Medicare 4 all. That is the fact & other side , they're just Plain Crazy & inhuman & don't care
Go get them mr @BernieSanders #Obamacare #ObamaDay show these men how it's done!!
Go and tell these monsters we don't want their healthcare bill!! Leave #Obamacare alone!! We will keep fighting back, you are horrible ppl.
Another ambush by CNN
Bring @jimmykimmel onto the show as well. That's what I would do.  That would be a show to watch where everyone will tune in.
Will turn into a SNL routine. Watch.
Remember baby Charlie.
BERNIE!
Waste of time.  Get actual experts. Not politicians.  Nobody trusts politician to give unbiased information!
Disappointed that you chose Bernie. He's not a Democrat and his "schtick" is getting old. Too polarizing.
You looking in the mirror boo?
You should have some moderate Senators participating in this event ... otherwise WTF .. you are pushing the extremes of both parties?
What happened to the notion "the best pubic policy for The People is bipartisan"? This polar opposite debate is not what's needed now!
This will be epic. Graham-Cassidy will continue thenlies and Sanders-Klobuchar will present facts. The moderator needs to be clear on facts!
Why? Worthless cable TV!
#bye
VOTE HELL NO ON HEALTHCARE!
Who are you going to give the questions to ahead of time, this time? @CNN #Liberal #FakeNews

This is good news...
Stupid idea. Focus on killing the Graham Cassidy death care bill first. I for one do not want to hear Sanders' blathering on anything.
And I am disgusted with hypocrites like Cassidy and Graham. Wish Murphy was talking instead of Sanders.
GOP should require states to cover pre existing conditions and not allow insurance caps or rate differentials which will kill many young/old
So stupid. Plays into false dichotomy of single payer or repeal & ACA is dying.  He is being used to scare more moderates into accepting CGB
Seriously, CNN?
@TomPerez Who picked these people?
Should have been Kamala Harris and Al @SenFranken
Will mad max be there?
Repubs choice may be: Pick the greater of two evils. Dems choice: Why this kind of phoney choice? ACA is better . . . and better is good.
Why is Sanders always in on the Healthcare debate? Why not @SenSherrodBrown or @timkaine
Not a single voice among them that I want to hear.
This should be a train wreck.

obamacare is dying and we the people do not want anything to do with bernies single payer nightmare...keep away from my healthcare
WWE cage match?
CNN attempt to preserve Obamacare
CNN coming through for its conservative “friends”. Twisted strategy I know but CNN is being played. Complicit News Network
THIS SUCKS! Shame on you CNN!
I wish @TulsiGabbard was teamed up with Bernie, we need a #Veteran out there kicking *ss and taking names!
No.
This is a terrible idea. It will not add to the discourse, it's a side show for ratings.
What a terrible breech in judgment once again on your part. A Dem should be debating them not BS.

Will @SenSanders be ON or OFF his meds that day? Makes all the difference for those of us who want a good time. 
pls bring up Grassley's "10 reasons not to vote for this bill" statement.
I swear to god if @SenSanders uses this as a platform to focus on single payer rather than saving ACA I will fucking flip out
@SenSanders has the MOST POPULAR and moral plan - #MedicareForAll
Should include @JohnKasich & @GovofCO to discuss #Bipartisan healthcare bill too! #NoLabels #CountryOverParty
They won't get a fair shake
Good person on the for Healthcare that is Sanders the others are all for kill Obamacare and put in place that can take away healthcare.
Why should anyone watch Graham & Cassidy? They will not disclose the fine print that increases preexisting coverage to unaffordable costs

Sorry, I just can't support CNN - don't trust them
CNN: Please instruct your moderators to blatantly call out lies. If you're going to let them spew bs this is just an exercise in futility.
ASK SANDERS IF HE WILL SHOW HIS TAX RETURNS... STILL WAITING.
Well Said
WON'T BE WATCHING.
I honestly cannot tolerate listening to Graham or Cassidy right now so... I'm gonna pass.
True, both spew lies for money. Something needs to be done about donations, they are basically willing to sacrifice human beings for money.
Citizens United the culprit IMO It needs to be repealed.Koch bros run the moderate Repubs, Mercer the RW'ers
Yeah, honestly greed is so rampant that people will literally kill to get ahead. And apparently our leaders agree that it's the right choice
That oughta be good can't wait to hear the b******* that goes flying in that room
Would like to see them invite Mark Levin!
Why would Obama's UN Ambassador be unmasking Americans?? Was she an investigator of sorts? Why wouldn't she be doing her job?
Well-done CNN...let's see more of that from you
It's a trap!
Please don't report the Samantha Power unmasking news cuz it's looking like Obama's people were spying on Trump.
Pay attention
Maybe you should invite the small biz owner Sanders talked down to at the last town hall.
Tou know the one that couldnt afford her own health insurance but Bernie shot her down for wanting to grow her biz (and give more ppl jobs)
the media is saturating our tv with Bernie just like they did Trump. Stop it please
Should have Rand Paul to balance out Sanders if you ask me. Klobichar will give the main stream Democrat position.
why Sanders? Stop it
Maybe because he is most popular pol in America and leading the charge in healthcare debate
I appreciate your town halls. Any chance for a moderate voice? Ya know fixing ACA instead of the polar opposites?
@SenateMajLdr needs to relax & let them do this over lunch break. I get it, Senate is no place for debates/decisions, but c'mon, lighten up.
Good maybe you can get them to explain "adequate and affordable" to waive pre-existings. The lies should be a hoot.
And be clear about what "access" means. I'm not sure they get how many of us are paying attention now. IDK.
Waste of time. CNN is biased and unfair!   Opposition party.

I hope is GOP moves away from campaign rhetoric and focus on what's best.Fix ACA and guaranteed pre-existing conditions.Legislate humanly
Not when the Koch bros said their purse strings are closed until this goes passes.Citizens United has gotta go!!
Invite Jimmy Kimmel
Will do better than their "reporters" who never challenge or ask follow ups.
Oh hey look Trump is right again!
#BREAKING France's Macron says Iran nuclear deal no longer enough to safeguard against growing power of Tehran in the Middle East
Can't wait for the bullshit hour.
Be sure to ask Sanders how he would pay for the $3.1 Trillion Medicare for all plan when the entire government budget for 2018 is $4.1 T
Not Sanders please!
 What? You don't want it to be dull!
Congress is a good place for debate. 
No kidding. Well said.
Here’s What Was REALLY Playing in Lawrence O’Donnell’s Earpiece He Had  Meltdown #ThursdayThoughts
Cnn can u 4 once give equal and fair time to dems
Doesn't do any good. They won't answer questions. And talk over everyone. Rudest people. Cannot believe anyone ever voted for these guys.
I really like Amy Klobuchar. She's very down to earth and knows what's up IMO.
Can we arm them with plastic bats......PONG...Cassidy you IDIOT...said like Colonel Klink of course
"Let's Get Ready To Rumble", in this corner the GOP & in this corner professional agitators brought in by the left; let the shouting begin.
Obamascare
Wow, they are gonna defend it publicly.
Will be a hell of a lot of lies.
I just wonder if the real liars nose will grow like Pinocchio  Both sides can't be telling the truth. 
Maybe Klobuchar will wear something sexy
Are you going to ask the right questions? Are you going to remind them who they work for? Are you going to pull a Paul Ryan treatment?
Don't waste our time on giving limelight to intransigence.
