All murderers who only care for the rich elites. Sad!
Because the more Americans they kill the fewer they have to cover.
#GCbillkills #SHAME
All of these "Christian" men on a mission to strip millions of insurance so they can line their own pockets. You men are DESPICABLE.
Nothing to brag about from anyone from the GOP
@LindseyGrahamSC @SpeakerRyan Lindsey Graham raised his sister on SS benefits too.SHAME ON THE REPUBLICANS! You are UNAMERICAN
@LindseyGrahamSC @SpeakerRyan  deserve healthcare unless there rich. We are NOT commodities. We are human beings & our Reps
#Trumpcare show everyone that the #GOP doesn't care about you, especially if you have life-threatening conditions.@LindseyGrahamSC
Just another privileged dirt bag!
That makes him a real dick and a dumb one.
Health care bill promotes mass murder
@LindseyGrahamSC @SpeakerRyan  Ryan said he wouldn't bring anything to the floor unless it was repeal?  This hypocrite was

#GreatReads: The staggering hypocrisy of Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham: http://bit.ly/2xkjGXg  @mattyglesias 
...bc they don't care about sick constituents. I'll never vote GOP again.

A bill -- finalized yesterday, has not been scored, amendments not allowed, and 3 hours final debate -- should be viewed with caution.
Bipartisan governors would prefer a bipartisan solution.
@LindseyGrahamSC @SpeakerRyan  want to throw us in the gutter to die. This is unacceptable in the richest country in the world.
Watch the VIDEO. Find out what is really in the bill. On @MSNBC with @JRubinBlogger
THESE MEN ARE LIARS @BillCassidy  @LindseyGrahamSC
JUST IN: American Medical Association comes out against new ObamaCare repeal bill http://hill.cm/UrYXlMA  
YOUR GONE IN 2018 RYAN!! VOTE OUT ALL THE @GOP IN 2018!!!!!!!!
Thank you Speaker Paul Ryan for supporting the Graham - Cassidy healthcare legislation.
And when this brilliant plan fails, it's time to oust him & the rest of his lobby whoring pals for real leadership

#DemandTheSamePlan
Isn't everyone in the plant already on a healthcare plan? How many of them will pay more for pre-existing conditions for their family?
Ryan pushing it must truly be the kiss of death for this POS excuse for a 'bill'. WTF do their constituents think of this career/ending move
Ask yourself why he would encourage senators to vote for it. It benefits him-not you. It benefits Trump-not you. It takes away ur benefits.
ryan should be strung up by his thumbs.  What a POS.
If this evil bill passes, it WILL be the demise of the Republican Party.
Under this bill, pregnancy will cost you an extra 17K. Metastatic cancer 172K. Autism 5K. Asthma 4K. This isn't a healthcare bill.
@LindseyGrahamSC @SpeakerRyan  educated w government funds  (Social Security benefits for college) but he thinks ppl don't
Yes-then they'll have passed a vindictive piece of legislation, dooming millions... just what they wanted to do. How proud they'll be.
What a fascist POS. I hope people realize this country has gone to shit.

This is a death sentence for all  #NoVote #deathcare
NO! This is the opposite of what Jesus would have you do.
They'll never get elected again
#GrahamCassidy would eliminate Medicaid entirely by 2026.

Not just the expansion. Everything.

Anyone who would vote for this is a monster.
For Shame on the GOP and their wanting to ram through this latest health care disaster #VoteNOGrahamCassidy #votethemout
Guess Ryan wants to look for another job soon. His poor kids having to go thru life knowing their dad will be remembered for being evil 

Americans deserve to know the CBO score BEFORE the vote on this bill!
@IronStache wouldn't wipe his ass with this bill. He has my full support in 2018.
We've always known that @speakerRyan was completely heartless. The question is whether @SenJohnMcCain is heartless. #VoteNOGrahamCassidy

He would, that selfish, uncaring, narcissistic Ayn Rand, *sshole. There is a reason everybody HATES Paul Ryan and @SenTedCruz
You guys do not want to go back to citizens being denied health care, poor or not. Sad that our own Reps are for billionaire ins companies
Did he explain to workers that even though they get company insurance benefits can be reduced and lifetime caps can be reinstituted?
Shame on u all!Gutting healthcare for poor young&old American people is Satanic! Put ur shoes on affected sick people! May God punish u all!
He is desperate for a win. Like trump.
BE ADVISED, @GOP. WE WILL **NOT** STAND FOR THIS. **STOP** MESSING WITH HC. YOU'RE *TERRIBLE* AT IT! SHAME ON YOU ALL! DROP G-C NOW! 
Under this bill, people with metastatic cancer will pay $142,650 more a year to get coverage.

That is not reform. That is a death sentence.
Scott Wrong.
SCOTT WONG DC GETS 3 BILLION FOR HARLEY DAVIDSON PLANT BUT CRAPS ON ACA SO HE DOESN'T HAVE TO PAY EMPLOYEE HEALTHCARE
NO NO NO
@brahmresnik @SpeakerRyan why?
How many other developed countries make poor sick people beg for politicians for their lives over and over?It is evil, cruel and wrong.

Patient groups come out in force to condemn new GOP bill to repeal ObamaCare http://hill.cm/5xruJ1b  
Typical Ryan idiocy.
Why does the GOP want to kill millions of Americans??
Thats b/c the Speaker is desperate to screw over as many poor people as possible.
So insurance companies can collect money when we're well then jack our rates when we get sick? That's a swell plan for health insurance cos
@LindseyGrahamSC @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump @WSJ @thehill @AP where is word for word replacement @GOP promised Americans?
Dear @harleydavidson,

#GrahamCassidyِ hurts veterans by cutting programs they rely on. Don't be fooled by a snake-oil-salesman.

How Republicans Could End Up Being The Party That Solidifies Obamacare http://trib.al/X0To0wl  
Why the draconian bill? Why does Lindsey Graham hate the American people?

9. Graham & Cassidy are going around saying that under their bill, if a state likes Obamacare, it can keep it. That's a lie.
Graham,Ryan neither of u can claim u r a Christian. Ppl w pre-existing conditions that u r literally going to kill. Not 2 mention Medicaid
Of course he is.

Republicans need a win for Trump & they are willing to deny Americans health care to get it. #votethemoutin2018 #notrumpcare
Funny how each new plan by GOP is better than the last, after saying the last plan was the best. They are only interested in anti Obama plan
Shame on the Republicans- trying to give Trump a win by denying real health care to millions of Americans:( Vote them out in 2018
Why do you hate Americans so much...?
So now, the republiCONz want to put Harley-Davidson out of business?
#GrahamCassidy is dangerous for America and a blatant partisan manipulation of congressional norms. Lyndsey Graham, you are pathetic.
And those Stupids will just applaud the loss of healthcare for millions
I thought the GOP was the "Pro Life Party"?  Prove it.
Take healthcare money away from Blue states and give it to Red, you're all despicable!
Why vote for something so catastrophic.  White men out done by a BLACK MAN!
Of course he wants millions stripped of insurance protections to use for his tax breaks for rich buddies! 
I hope a brown recluse crawls up his pee hole.
Oh big business wants votes to take away people's healthcare
Because the money train stops if the GOP doesn't repeal the ACA by Sept. 30!

Who gives a flying fuck what Paul Ryan does any more? His political career is over. People don't vote for hypocrites.
Ryan trying again to carry out his long dreamed of fifty state killing spree!
Well they must all be fortunate enough not to have a disabled grandson or a disabled mother who counts on Medicaid 100%
We encourage @SenateGOP to #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
Killing children, denying coverage is not the way to go.
#Trumpcare isn't health care
Paul Ryan is going to get an enormous payout if he gets this through. Set for life $$. He doesn't care about constituents.
Speaker Ryan wants to harm millions and kill thousands so he can give millionaires tax cuts.
I'd like to encourage every Senator to ring Paul Ryans neck. He obviously doesn't think a bit about the Ameerican people.


Gross.
Well that sucks big. This plan is worse than the last one. Way to spend 7 yrs doing nothing Reps then cram down a bill w no debate or #s
Hey, Paul, if you like this Graham-Cassidy insurance so much, why don't YOU go on it? #BullshitLiar
GFYourselves!
I have emailed mine to vote no.

 I encourage everyone else to do the same.
Spineless Repubs! Two bachelor SC senators who care nothing for those who of us need protection for pre-existing conditions! Vote them out!
WHY??? People will literally die. Is that the plan? Kill all of your supporters?
Good luck with that..many there use ACA..AND they read.
@SpeakerRyan Must be voted out!! The @IronStache can save us!! He's honest and good!!

I asked people to share what it's like to live in a country with universal health care. The responses that came in were incredible. 
@SpeakerRyan is a lying asshole. He wants to gut Medicaid, take the money and give it to the wealthy. He's getting paid by Russia!
All those dumb old white guys in Congress w/ an %18 percent approval rating are repealing med law with no hearings or acctg. 

#FuzzyMath
The GrahamCassidy bill is the worse version of TrumpCare yet. It strips away all protections for preexisting conditions!
He just wants to say they did it. He doesn't care millions will lose healthcare. All lawmakers should have  the same healthcare they pass!

Ryan is complicit. Lock him up! Where's the CBO evaluation? This sneaky approach stinks!
Of course he is, his war on poor, sick, and vulnerable never stops.
Well speaker ryan sucks ..so..
Speaker Ryan is a shill. Nothing more. There is nothing this worthless politician won't do for reelection. Zero morals. Embarrassment
I hope he explained that most of their lives and their families' lives would be negatively impacted as a result.
Who? Hasn't this guy been saying the same thing since January? He has no sway at all
Last week I was weighing how much support this had in the House. Today:
With the potential for 30 million Americans to lose insurance, he must be thrilled? @SenJohnMcCain This is not even close to regular order.
Don't know if McCain is making regular order conditional. I wouldn't count on his vote.
I'm not counting on anyone - I just keep tweeting and calling.
I know but focus on Murkowski.
Cause he is a weasel
Because of course he is.
