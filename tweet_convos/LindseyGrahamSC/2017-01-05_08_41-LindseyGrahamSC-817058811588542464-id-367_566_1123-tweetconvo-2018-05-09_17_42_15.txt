@SenJohnMcCain There was 0 evidence Russians interfered/why not sanction Obama for Brexit & Israel interference?
Your point being it's okay if Russia interferes with our elections if Obama did the same abroad? You're okay with Russian hacks?
Not what I said. I do not believe the same intel political agencies that lied about NSA spying & Benghazi videos. Hillary lost.
You appear to only believe Donald Trump.
No, I believe the facts of what has happened in this country in the last 8 years.  And yes, I believe Assange & Wikileaks.
I believe the material wikileaks has published is accurate. I always have.
We differ in three areas - (1) I don’t think the bad behavior in it is as big a deal as you do. A big deal, but not as big a deal.
(2) The way wikileaks used the information was designed to have the most negative election impact, not shed the most light.
@LindseyGrahamSC Information now shows that Russia didn't interfere with elections. On the other hand, Saudi Arabia did.
Russia's in the house
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC if congress Repubs showed more respect to current @POTUS then adversaries would as well. Your disrespect..
for @POTUS is what has hurt our country more than anything.
.@NBCNews FUCK LINSEY GRAHAM, FUCK JOHN MCCAIN, why are these traitor cuck RINOs attempting to speak for the American public?
Well, they are our elected representatives. This isn't russia, comrade... at least not yet. Russian bots need not apply
i need some douche rag to tell me they're elected?   DERP.   By mentioning Russians, you out yourself as a clueless sheep.
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC so who is going to hold Obama accountable for trying to interfere with Israel's election? speak to that!
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC We need you to run for President. Thank you for your service
He was one of the 16 that tried to take on Trump and dropped out now trying to stay relevant
Yes I know. It was an opportunity missed. Someone with ethics and integrity
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC those in glass houses should not be throwing rocks.
@LindseyGrahamSC angry about Russian hacking? Now u know how Americans feel about the NSA.
you want start war you r crazy........
PLEASE block Tillerson and Flynn appointments.  Connections to Kremlin r very disturbing.  VRY concerned
Just for you there is enough to share with McCain
what about Trump's involvement? https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3259984-Trump-Intelligence-Allegations.html …
@LindseyGrahamSC If OBAMA had done more, would u have supported him? Or play party line over country as GOP has done 4 eight yrs
We know you don't  care about cyber anything. You are screaming your hatred of Trump. You hate him. We get it.
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC Where the hell is punishment for @HillaryClinton This is such BS! She broke the law PERIOD! Unbelievable!
Fact of the matter is that Putin is engaged in acts of war against the USA & Trump seems ready to betray as well.
@LindseyGrahamSC What is this we are hearing about 10 Billion paid to Iran? Americans are ready to throw a lot of boulders!
The old warmonger should retire Where was he when Obama gave Iran $10B?? Seriously, warmonger should retire.
That's fake news, it's been debunked so many times, only idiots keep repeating it. the U.S. OWED them the money.
who the hell pays a 40 year old Bill
especially to the #1 sponsor of terror. That's the reason it was never paid before.
You need to confirm that you are a destructive hillbilly woman or man in transition. Racist hater!!!!!!
American ppl aren't interested in you starting #WW3. We want to throw rocks at you & your boyfriend @SenJohnMcCain. #Warmongers
@LindseyGrahamSC Espionage? How about those basement servers that intercepted State Emails?
Gravely concerned over DJT sympathy for Putin.  He gave green light to cyberattack last summer.  Borders treason
How about throwing a rock these guys you crooked POS..
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC take a few from your head boy!
With you senator Graham on this one. Appreciate your leadership on the continued cyberattacks.
Even a broken clock is right twice a day, Thank you Sen. @LindseyGrahamSC http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/sen-graham-says-that-anyone-celebrating-russian-interference-is-a-political-hack-republicans-included-850143299674 …
GOP and Trump will never let you investigate.
GIVE GRAHAM  HIS PINK SLIP..
@LindseyGrahamSC Evil cells of 1%  "Placing" Puppets in America & Europe War Profits & Genocides. #ElectionHacked  #TrumpSwampWorld
What Trump has done with Putin is Treason in 1953 we America put THE Rosenbergs to death by Exucution for less .
I think we need to throw a rock too.  Need to know if we really had a fair and free election.  If not-do-over.

We will all be waiting to see how big those rocks are
@LindseyGrahamSC Mr Rino, Russians if it were them, hacked DNC, the Dems leaked info, its their fault. Podesta gave his password

Thank you @LindseyGrahamSC - you and @SenJohnMcCain are fighting for us. @SenSchumer @SenWarren @SenSanders where are you? #RESIST
Trump's a rock, throw him at Russia.
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC Ask Sen Sanders how he feels about DNC hack. He wouldnt kno he was cheated without help from the hackers.
@summerbrennan @MSNBC Obama threw pebble because we are behind on cyber security/warfare.
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC this man should go ahead and join the Democratic Party. Bitter person. Please leave
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC How about up our game with firewalls, restrict foreign IP addresses, good password policies, stop hackers!
@summerbrennan 
Me too. My rock has NEW ELECTION written on it
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC The correct response to getting hacked is better password policies and firewall rules, not cyber war,IDIOTS
Obama wanted to throw a rock, but McConnell stood in the way.
It's refreshing seeing a Repub acting like a statesman instead of a puppet of Putin's like Trump.
Sen. Lindsey Graham is ready to suck Obama's cock
@LindseyGrahamSC 
Good 4 U! Stand4America! 
Democrats like me support yr stand against 
Trump-Putin collusion
Be strong 4 democracy
@johnmccain2016
Good4U!
Stand 4 Democracy against trump-Putin collusion
WE DEMs support UR doing what 
Americans DESERVE & EXPECT!
So, you weren't actually alive in the 60's. Don't help Obama destroy our country.Your thinking is dangerous to USA
What will you do to Obama for tampering in the election of Netanyahu? Hacking emails of German Chancellor. Really?
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC So Graham where was the tough talk/sanctions when China hacked OPM?
@LindseyGrahamSC if President Obama had thrown a rock you would have criticized him. Now you and McCain can showboat & get noticed!
@realDonaldTrump how about you support trump instead expressing your opinion; make up for breaking promise
TRUMP IS A DRAFT DODGER TO PROTECT AMERICA AND STAY AWAY FROM THE VIETNAM WAR , HE IS A COWARD,NEXT IS RICO ACT
Thanks for speaking out. I wish more on both sides of aisle were as brave. Not a partisan issue. USwas attacked!
State sponsored actors are attacking our critical IT systems.  They must pay an extremely painful price.
as the 60 something product of life long Democrats, seeing an R before a politician's name turns me off But you
@SenJohnMcCain U are a dangerous warmonger. Trump is right to repair relations w/Russia. Do U want WW3??
#YEYEEGF
Thankful for the hacks...now we see what crooks and colluding liars HRC and the DNC really are!
Rocks?U been throwing flames,sir,on Iraq/ME/Russia &on any gd dat @POTUS is doing. Best @realDonaldTrump ignores u
Potential for good long term relations is more important than short term retaliation for Putin's revenge.
Cannot seriously expect Russia not to retaliate for Hillary's interference with Duma elections?  Blame her??
At least Obama sides with the US over Russia. #NeverTrump #NeverPutin
https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/817748207694467072 …
trump wants to shower them with love ! our democracy is done.
Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. Only "stupid" people, or fools, would think that it is bad! We.....
Chinese hacked Obama & McCain campaigns in 2008 but no sanctions or outrage:
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC throwing rocks breaks class houses.
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC Sir between you & Senator McCain, you have a chance to stand up to Trump & go after Russia for their crimes
so war-mongering is cool now in MSM? This is insane, sick and hateful.
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC hey Lindsey were going to throw rocks at you
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC n propaganda fake news again you CIA- bullshit no facts again guys
@themiterman @MSNBC For many that don't know Senator Graham, this was one of his finest moments. Lol and I am not a fan of /party.
I have never been a fan of him. He was a military man until recently and is a real patriot.
@zotan220 @MSNBC Never says what throwing a rock represents.  Bombing? More ICBM's? More what?
@zotan220 @MSNBC then do it Lindsey!!! You know what Putin is capable of!!!!
@LindseyGrahamSC  Appreciate your standing up against the hacking, Russia, PEOTUS. Need more Republicans 2 standup for country 1st.
@leapgerbils @MSNBC Then u do that Graham as long u do a bold thing with this Idiot who will get us all killed,yet!
@LindseyGrahamSC I hope you're on the right side of history & fully investigate @realDonaldTrump ties to Russia #Countryb4party

@LindseyGrahamSC  Obama should be brought up on charges of sending operatives to Israel to influence Net's re-election!
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC 

Canard
Finally one of the few Republicans who cares about the people and the truth
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC @SenJohnMcCain @realDonaldTrump @POTUS  Excellent hearing for America! Great job Sen McCain! Need SHOTPUT!!
(2/2)OUTSTANDING  back & forth! Sen GRAHAM knows  full impact/PUTIN!
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC Quit trying to start a FAKE war!!!!
Yeah, lets throw a rock, start a war get people killed, sounds fun. Why should we listen to a professional liar?
Please Mr. Graham, throw some boulders. This is a huge national security issue.
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC our country is being compromised by an irrational inept egomaniac! Challenge the EC Vote. DJT in on hack!
@LindseyGrahamSC And you'll keep throwing rocks till you get us in another way. Cuz that's what you do!
here we go again. Politics and politically motivated intel agencies driving world towards war again.
@KathyNeeds If all had been trying to advance the well being of USA instead of bigotry we wouldn't be in this mess. Empires fall.
throw it. Throw it now!
What?? Lindsey Graham has found religion? Well, I think you're a jackass, but go Lindsey go!
Lindsey, you slimeball snake, your top of the list to go 
when the swamp gets drained
@LindseyGrahamSC : US Senator with Stone Age mentality
. @LindseyGrahamSC #maga get a personality w guts & loyalty to country coward loser
remember tv miniseries AmeriKa re USSR takeover of US! Plot sounds like fear of Trump Putin plot google the plot
Tell Rush Limbaugh that radio is dead, that no listens to the radio anymore.  U B Clueless.
@LindseyGrahamSC Rocks are good idea! You other people are crazy fake news and need more proof. Must be Russian. Or baby Trumps
When we cant get the truth from our own media I'll gladly take it from Russians, Martians, or even Mooing Cattle
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC yes!!!! Throw rocks! Big rocks!
@LindseyGrahamSC So where were you & you're noise b/c of these events? 
Sore loser & useless. #WakeUpSC
That should be easy for Graham since he has rocks for brains.
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC I'm ashamed to be from SC . Never again will lindsey  graham get my vote.
@LindseyGrahamSC You are a scary man.
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC Madame Senator, is this the first time our Government has been hacked by a foreign power?
If we wanted a Dem Senate Little Man Graham, Lame Brain McCain (Snitch Mitch 4 that matter)we'ld have voted 4 one!
You need to allow new Commander in Chief & Tillerson to address, NOT LITTLE MAN GRAHAM and sidekick Lame Brain McCain!
The Chinese r using Russians 2 undemine us all over globe, due 2 their cultural access.Rock 4 brains isn't going to cut it Graham!
Why that is a problem, including for you and McCain who got your rears kicked Well, now the problem is Rep base Little Man Graham!
drones and replicate! No problem. Ask Clapper. But if they hack Dem email (not a gov agency/or classified) or put propaganda on RT
before the first jet rolls off the assembly line, a jet that cost 86-104 million a pop, and produces knockoff, they steal our..
Nuclear Plants, Satellites, power grids, pentagon, and defense industries...no problem, ask Clapper! China steals F-35 technology..
China no doubts scans names into databases around the world so Americans can be nabbed..no problem! Check! China hacks our..
Obama rolls out red carpet in DC for Chian as our compremised spies being removed from China...no issue! Check!
Ask Clapper. Chinese hack 22 million sec clearences and gut our entire human intel capability, and it's just espionage! Check! ..
Clapper is not the best, he is a partisan hack! You arfe right on Baltics, but that isn't related to this BS hearing!
holding back for leverage maybe? GOP throws rocks at PBO and nothing at #PEOTUS
Do you think the base does not see what you and McCain are up to, and scores you are trying to settle? How dare you!
Not one specific thing mentioned in this hearing that Russians did, nor any request for one! Pure partisan BS!
so this guy wants to go to war with Russia based on a claim by the CIA that could be false. Great, the bad ole days are back
Pretty much true of all GOP
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC
I'd like to agree with Sen Graham, but you know he ran against me....
@LindseyGrahamSC the same people that said Iraq had wmd
CIA did not say Iraq had WMD.  Bush/Cheney found 1 person who made that claim & ran w/ it.
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC liars #fake #news #lies.
you have all been hacked the first day you bought your computer wake up
I've never agreed with you on anything,.... except this. Go Lindsey
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC But What are you going to do to educate @realDonaldTrump and get him to stop Tweeting stupid stuff?
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC NeoCon #Bilderberg puppet, so what is the dirt they have on you to make you play ball? #fakenews WW3?
At least he didn't support Assange, denounce Intel and complement Putin
@LindseyGrahamSC go after Russia. And J Assange. Speak truth to power.
more liars so you might want to stick to facts. Thousands of professionals are watching .
Quit the fake news NBC ,experts and various agency operations leaked the truth. It is certain  US agents also will expose m
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC cause Lindsey Graham won't be the one in Russia fighting. He's comfortable sitting behind his desk
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC Exactly what. Did the Russians do and Exactly how did they affect the election?
Because you are a war hungry neocon.
Embarrassing when Mr. "Make America Great Again" publicly praises Assange & Putin & mocks our CIA & FBI & has public Twitter temper tantrums
THANK YOU SENATOR!
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC 
WHY are you not concerned about the content of the hacked emails? !
Throw it straight up as far as you can and try to spot it coming down.
the question is why does Lindsey Graham want to start WW3 . Does Mossad or the Mr Soros  have compromising photos ?
Kudos to you, sir! This is truly a non-partisan issue that needs to be addressed by both sides.
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC trump is a traitor.  And he's insane.  Psych eval and then impeachment
I'm more ready to start lobbing something else at @KremlinRussia_E and @wikileaks than rocks
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC we may not ever agree but there's always a first something needs to be done about Russia
Don't watch MSNBC OR NBC OR CNN you are all liars
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC And where were you years ago when this was happening.No where to be found of course.
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC Sir, I appreciate what you are doing but Trump needs to be investigated. You know it. We know it. Please.
Why is Graham leading the witness? Isn't he a lawyer? #badacting #badactor(s) #script
You have GOT to stop Trump OMG  My children will be blown up.  He insults the fiber of our nation
Lindsey Graham and John McCain are George  Soros's puppet paid off corrupt this is the swamp to drain traitors
Lindsey Graham is George Soros puppet Lindsey U are the swamp to drain, corrupt traitor to americans shame on U
If situation was reversed talking points would be different. President Obama was correct about decision.
@LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC No BS, straight to the point, but oh how you love war Mr Graham. Let's prevent future attacks first.
Actually Obama threatened by ur unethical leader @SenateMajLdr sayin he wud yell partisan if obama tried 2 sanction Russia during election
