Sigh. I hope republicans don't always step in line. We need you to fight! 
This is a disaster Sen. McCain.
You 2 r an embarrassment. Always anti Trump, your time has passed. 2 dopes that public has tuned out! Goaway
Such a poor decision on your part; am so disappointed in your lack of citizen representation. #MidtermElections
Yeah, thanks no thanks
Tillerson is an agent of Putin. They've obliterated the state dept & want to lift sanctions against Russia.
Two PUBLICITY WHORES for the DNC - McCain & Lindsey Graham!
Sell outs. The people won't forget.
yes they will
Not if I can help it.
Shame on you. You work for the ppl not 4 big oil. How do you sleep at night?
When contribution numbers come out, they'll be some new big oil $$ in their campaign acct.
We're so glad you're giving these noms careful consideration. We hope you'll listen to teachers & #DumpDeVos
@CBSNews McCain a team player like super bowl we voted him to support Trump100% @realDonaldTrump PROGRESS bottom line OR OUT
TRAITORS!!!!
If he is OK, who might you vote against? We need Republicans with to stand up to DT!
two Russian obsessed idiots. Get over Russia and move on. Everyone is laughing at you two. 
very bad decision why would you do that to the American people
Wow.  What little hope I had that you both were true statesmen is now gone.  Sellouts.
You should be ashamed. Support of this "friend of Vladimir" is unconscionable. History will not view youwell
You've never been working for the masses you've shown your true self Mr suppressor you'll leave in disgrace
We can not have a President that makes Enemies out of our Allies and Allies out of our Enemies.
Wow what a "Maverick"!
I am upset by your votes re Tillerson. Confirming him means end of sanctions and harm to US and NATO.  Why?
Pls explain why Tillerson's ties to Russia and desire to lift sanctions for oil are not a threat. PLEASE.
irresponsible!! Here comes more propaganda. Congress needs term limits, then they'll do actual work.
We need our R senators to look and listen to the country. Look at the marches! Look at the popular vote!
bad move. More trouble in store. #tillersonhearing
. Sad that u  confirm nomin of R Tillerson with his past Russian & Putin ties.He,Trump&Flynn terrify us(Russ)
so disappointed in the 2 of you caving under pressure. This affiliation with Russia is dangerous
@LindseyGraham Shame on you!
There's still time for you to vote your conscience on Tillerson. You know full well he would be a disaster.
Why didn't you oppose John Kerry?
@CBSNews McCain a team player like super bowl we voted  him to support Trump100% @realDonaldTrump PROGRESS bottom line OROUT.
Against your constituents. Against your country. You are traitors, senators. Foes to democracy.
E tu @SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC?!  I'm crushed.
.@SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC Sanctions? Yes or no.
This is beyond disappointing. More concerned w/ first 100 days than Nat'l Security.
I want to hear if the bill they already introduced for harsher Russia sanctions is going forward
They're not so stupid to vote for Tillerson 1st & expect a vote on sanctions. Not newbies.
Are you two a matched set? I don't see either of you do anything without the other... #TermLimits
what a crock! Do you have ExxonMobil stock? He lied under oath, no taxes conflicts #Russia #termLimits
McCain + Graham stop obstructing GOP has Congress(on Trump coatails) and the Presidency Now is chance to do something
Disappointed by your flip flop on Tillerson. Where's the Maverick that bucked the GOP extreme right agenda??
This is wrong. Vote NO! #Russia #Oil #climatechange
Very disappointed in both of you.  #CabinetOfArmandHammers
"Though we still have concerns about his past dealings w the Russian government & President Vladimir Putin"

I don't see any flying pigs, they must be on the dollar bills you just got for selling out your constituents.
Happy I didn't vote for you in AZ,  you obv don't care about the Amer people and have been bought. What was your price?
@marcorubio Blink twice if HE is blackmailing you too. We The People will protect you. #ProtectUs #NoRex
you both should be ashamed. So much for keeping him "in check."
Can't believe it-now we have 2 people with DEEP ties w/ Russia..& America said NO
SO disappointing. He refused to answer questions-has HUGE ethical issues & Russian ties.
When are you going to stand up to Trump ???
you Know Rex Tillerson in not the right person for this job. How spineless are you ?
we are counting on you to restore this ship back to sanity and you are failing
What are you guys doing to this country ?!!?!?!?!?!?
As one of your constituents I'm very disappointed in this. I'm looking forward to 2018.
HUGE Disappointment, especially from the two of you. Thought you had some ethics.
sold your souls, I'm so very sorry. #TheResistance
I'm so disappointed in you. You could have been a hero instead you're just another Trump lackey. #RussiaHacking
- I am so disappointed.  I thought you had more concern for the people of the US.  There go the sanctions. @LindseyGrahamSC
@marcorubio no,  please vote no!!!
are you looking for these? I found them in Trump's pocket! Can't believe you caved on Tillerson
I thought you would do the right thing for our COUNTRY.yesterday you sold us down the river 30pieces, judas
I had higher expectations of you...thought you cared enough for this country to stand up and protect it.
so who's ass taste better trump pence or Putin's
WEAK.
COWARDLY.
SELLOUTS.
just saw you on the news saying you still have concerns senator McCain, listen to your concerns. Vote NO
Vote No to Rex!! it's a bad choice! WHY do you go against the ppl? Why do you want to take pension from MIL?
rubberstamping all of Trump cabinet. how disappointing! SAD!
just when we thought America had at least two GOP senators that would put America above Russia.
what dirt did Russia dig up on you to make you turn traitor? You use to be an American hero. Sad puppet now.
you should be ashamed of yourselves. History has its eyes on you. #villains
How can you do it? No Tillerson, Sessions,DuVois, Manchin. Represent us! Ryan & McConnell gone. U 2 soon
McCain you are a 2 sided twit! You voted for Tillerson
Not one nominee is worthy of confirmation. You sold out to fascism. I can't believe that I'm surprised.
You say you stand for the people and work for the people. LIARS.  You work to fill your own pockets.
Trump was correct on one thing YOU ARE NO WAR HERO. YOU WERE CAPTURED.  JUST LIKE NOW, YOU SURRENDERED TO HIS PICKS.  SHAME
When there's doubt,  then there is doubt. Don't vote to confirm when there is doubt. NOT OK.
as a citizen, I am concerned that a "friend of Russia" is OK for State Dept. Didn't answer key Qs. NOT OK.
Tillerson didn't change his stripes over the last couple days -
Color me shocked.
how could you?  America weeps at politics over country.
I had such hope you would vote against Tillerson's nomination. As your constituent, I am incredibly disappointed.
Shame on you for yes vote on TILLERSON!!! I don't believe in you anymore. You're AFRAID of TRUMP AREN'T YOU
sympathizers
Wow, at women's March much discussion about how you were finally respectable. Guess we were wrong
How can you do this knowing Russia hacked this election?
Tillerson is unacceptable.
I implicitly trust your judgment on these matters. Please make as many TV appearances as possible.
Investigate @realDonaldTrump 's ethics in full He's set the bar too low for the American presidency.
Please subpoena @realDonaldTrump ' s tax returns for any trace of Russian election tampering.
Investigate the Russian connection to @realDonaldTrump The American electorate deserves an answer.
Dear Senators, please double down on Russian sanctions. Punish them on behalf of all American voters.
Senator, you are a coward! Grow a spine!@Indivisible_SAZ @IndivisibleTeam
Trump repeatedly said he's taking oil in Iraq.Isnt Tillerson wrong optic now that troops jeopardized by tht?
So much for conviction, integrity, country before party. How much did they promise you ?
Do you feel the thousands of prayers.  You and Lindsey are high on the list.  God is bringing light, repent.
.@SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC So disappointing. This is how you stand up for America? #sad
Okay, I read the statement.  Tillerson said he won't impose sanctions that harm US business.  Your answer?
while I will always honor your service to our country, this vote of support disgusts me. #ShamefulPartisan #whereIsYourHonor
hallelujah, you finally did something good for the country in supporting Tillerson for Sec State.
We're so disappointed in you both and Marco Rubio. I guess GOP now stands for "Government Of Putin!"
you are both cowards. He laughed at and ignored US sanctions and is in league with Putin. #shameonyou
motherfuckung traitors!!
I thought the two of you had a moral compass, but I guess I was wrong.
The Vietcong did not break U, but sorry Trump regime did,sorry to a great leader for social justice, my heart breaks at your loss.
you'll always be a hero to me, but today I'm very disappointed in ur decision on Tillerson. You've sold ur country to Russia.
Cowards, collaborators - you both should be ashamed of yourselves.
#VoteThemOut @realDonaldTrump #draintheswamp = #TrumpLie
Get out of politics u 2 old white men! You are going along w #treason #TrumpIsInsane
why'd you both sell out on Tillerson? It's clear he has unhealthy relationship with Putin. Won their medal!!
Those pigs are flying now!
shame on you
You should both be ashamed of yourselves. You're craven men who can no longer call yourselves patriots.
disappointed but no surprise
So much for country over party
Just when I thought one or both you might have spines. Disgraceful.
going to work my butt off to have you voted out in 2018 so be prepared to lose your job
sell out no balls - nasty white man with no character
...Sold out for that oil Money...?
@marcorubio You are all cowards. #resist
For a while there I really thought you had a spine with cord and brain attached #Resist #conflictsofinterest
Careful consideration? Counting all those dollars that Exxon will be making when sanctions are lifted?
I guess your idea of a maverick is to be a sell-out
if it were up to the 99 senators not named Ron Johnson to run a F500 corp, bankrupt it in 6 months.
. @SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC  Please reconsider, Tillerson is a bad fit for State.
shame on you!
Bad! Also you did not find time to meet the protesting Veterans against Tillerson (your Office last Thurs.)
You two need a spine!  Thought you were on the side of America!  You'll never stand up to trump.  All talk!!
So disappointing. We need you to choose country over party before it's too late. Thanks for nothing.
@SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC
Deeply disappointed that you voted Yes on Tillerson's confirmation.
men, I'm sorry, but THAT was the WORST possible choice ever made- besides #Trump of course. What HORROR
Once again party over country. The world is watching our weakness and division.
a joint statement ??? Twins??
you're all stooges
cuck
.@SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC What a disappointment Sen McCain thought you had better #resolve to care for #America #first
Coward
It's almost as if all members of the GOP do not want to be re-elected.
So you 2 have sold out to Russia. I expected better. How can you "support" NATO and still vote for him? SMH
cowards!
Same ole party lines. You know he is not right but give in to party. Ugh
What's going on w/cyberhacking cmte? Oh right: nothing. #MaverickIsGone
You really are bought-&-paid-for, aren't you? Occasional blustery talk, but absolutely no action.
Shame! Supporting a Putin ally.
How naive can you be to support Putin's business partner & "hero" as SoS? We need govt experience at State
Congrats, cowards.Big talk against Russian influence on or democracy, but BIGGER cave-in to trump. Shame.
http://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-01-04/john-mccain-on-supporting-rex-tillerson-when-pigs-fly …
Pathetic that you lack the strenght to stick to your convictions...
Roll over. Good boys 
Can't believe you're going to support Tillerson. What happened to your principles? #MakeRussiaGreatAgain
As a constituent, I have lost any hope that you will work for the good of anyone but your party and money.
I am disappointed to hear this. I was counting on your ethics to protect our country from Tillerson.
So disappointed in you both.  We will remember this.  You guys need more backbone.
Saw you as conscience of GOP as democracy is under assault by Bannon & Putin. You've abandoned our country#darkdaysahead
very sad to see you giving Russia another"in".  Who will protect US from this great threat if you fold?
“Hitler did not steal power,” the Pope said “He was elected by his people and then he destroyed his people.”
Graham kinda surprised me but John McCain? I used to respect him but he has sold all of us out to Russia.
You will be held accountable by US and by the WORLD_You are a traitors to humanity @trumpleaks @womensmarch
What's the point now of your Russia investigation? I had faith in y'all, not @marcorubio. Typical #GOPValues
Adamantly reject this oil billionaire, his Russian collusion/harm to earth/future generations. NO NO NO
SHAME ON YOU! YOU ARE A TRAITOR TO YOUR COUNTRY.
You both know what a danger Russia is & Tillerson, like Trump, is a Putin puppet. Shameful decision.
Wow. For awhile there I thought the old John McCain was back. It's past time to clean out the entitled royalty like you 2 in #Congress.
Cant wait until your ass is voted out. You dont deserve to sit your crusty ass in that Senate seat.
oh, those flying pigs and javelinas ........
Really, really, really disappointed in both of you. All talk, but in the end, party first and country last.
Saddened by YOUR decision. Next time represent the folks that put you in office.
when "pigs fly?" Was that an alternative fact? Many are looking to the two of you in this scary time.
I will always respect you, sir, but today I am gravely disappointed in your judgement.
We had hoped that the two of you would be the voice of reason with some of these nominees. What happened??
How can you support him?! He obviously is there to withdraw sanctions in Russia so Exxon can drill for oil!
BOOO !
Thank you, Comrades!
Just read your statement. Honestly sounds like you've been compromised.
A historic moment, that's for sure. A grand nod to your legacy.....of tough talk and no action.
WE thank you,John McCain,for enduring hatred from #Dems for not being obstructionist,give us a chance:
