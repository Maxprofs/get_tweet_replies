LMFAO, Trump supporters are brainwashed idiots like hitlers were
Again, thank you. You both put country above politics. It's noticed and appreciated.
When people with a brain voted for Obama 4 two terms..
WOW!!! 2016 has me agreeing with McCain AND Graham?!!! What is the world coming to??!!!!
It comes down to Americans vs Russians. Fighting for the life of the USA.
Are u smoking crack? When were they our friends? Please show us..
thank-you both for being patriots above partisans like most of our party has turned out to be.
HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAH... "Vladimir Putin ate my homework."
why rain on a compliment. Are you that small and petty?
Because @LindseyGrahamSC & @SenJohnMcCain are NOT patriots. Stop listening to the #shovelready pablum coming out of their holes.
U R a foul mouthed and can't make a logical argument without insults. Not worth listening too
words R weapons. When thoughtless words R said by people in power, people die.
I intend to do everything I can to see that u don't get elected again in SC. Your a joke
Sirs: the more urgent threat to our country, our troops, Intel groups, etc. is  @realDonaldTrump!!
#russiasanctions despicable announcement,but coming from a beacon that loves war and turmoil.

I sure you and McCain don't loose you're backbone and stand you're ground
The question @realDonaldTrump &@KellyannePolls need to answer: What did you know and when did you know it?
as real republicans, please vote against Russia loving tillerson and sessions too
@LouiseMensch @LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain Soros'puppets. He gave money to McCain's charity, and Graham's campaign. RINOs!
DEAR SENATORS:  WHY TRUMP IS GETTING INAUGURATED WHEN HE HAVE BEEN SPYING FOR PUTIN AND THE RUSSIANS?
you r right stay strong. Pls discover trumps Russian investment figures.  it is see me now or see me later
You better put a halter on PEOTUS
as I democrat, I thank you. I have gained respect for you this year.
Well go along and look at the pictures from the weekend.
2 peas in a pod.
@JoyAnnReid @SenJohnMcCain And Lock trump up for treason we hope
@JoyAnnReid @SenJohnMcCain Appoint a special prosecutor to investigate treason against Trump...
Let's find out if Trump/Bannon were complicit in Russian hacking..
wow,  McCain and Graham are now heroes of the Corporate Democrats.
idiots
@JoyAnnReid @SenJohnMcCain thank you!
We need an independent inquiry NOT funneled through Congress which is full of Trump loyalists.
We need an independent investigation into Russia/Trump.
Senator Graham, the pres elect's statements re: Russia are terrifying!
Nobody is doing a better job at deligitimizing himself than DT. Keeps praising attackers.
@JoyAnnReid @SenJohnMcCain Start by impeaching Trump.
I hope you gentlemen are serious.  Because this is a real mess.
as a Democrat we are counting on you to help us save our country.
Good luck to you. Your courage is greatly appreciated.
thank you, Mr Graham & Mr McCain. Much respect to you for protecting our country & govt,signed,a #democrat
thank you both for speaking out.
What y'all need to do is provide, we citizens, the evidence that Russia hacked us.
No, they don't. You're not their teacher, they don't have to show you their work. You want to discredit 17 agencies based on?
I didn't ask your dumbass to tweet me. But since you did. Our government owes us proof that Russia hacked our system.
You're definitely one of the #Cheetoflakes.
LMAO! You sure told me #cheetoflake! I haven't seen any evidence of your claimed "education" & "culture" yet.
how has mccain not been arrested yet or isn't under house arrest for crimes against humanity?
from a yellow dog Paul wells to e dem who's #with her THANK YOU GENTLEMEN
Senator, a bipartisan committee would have equal pert membership. Go get Rubio and make it 51.
@ColMorrisDavis @SenJohnMcCain Without a comprehensive investigation? Does Paul Ryan want one?
@JoyAnnReid @SenJohnMcCain the president elect says it's time to move on nothing to see here! Figured it out yet?
Pls understand that @realDonaldTrump is the  #ManchurianCandidate .  You must stop him from taking office.
@Bernie4Revo @SenJohnMcCain whatever.  Unless you declare election illegitimate doesn't matter much
I hope that you pound some sense into mitch McConnell
due to trumps impulsiveness and his mouth we are going to end up in a war
Thank you for standing up.
You so far have not proved that such an attack took place. Facts please, not rhetoric.
good luck with it you colleagues seem not to care and are willing to roll over .
Your favorite Golden Gal with Pants Suit lost. You hate Trump.  It drives you crazy that he won. WAH!
I am concerned that there will be no checks and balances .
YOU KNOW THAT HE IS INVOLVE WITH PUTIN AND HE AND HIS TEAM KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON SINCE 2016.
You realize you guys are not only fighting Russia/KGB/FSB - but also a direct Rusian collaborator in the WH?
explain how Trump collaborated

gosh you're right that screengrab is irrefutable proof of -- collaboration. Do you know what the word means?
Meanwhile at The Kremlin...
what is that meme supposed to illicit from me?
prove 2 the country this can be bipartisan, fair, honest, and open. You & Senator McCain can lead here.
Agreed.  This is truly an opportunity at unification under one cause - w/ or w/o PEOTUS support.
this literally can restore the people's faith in congress
I have never seen so many #brainwashed #lemmings that are given you a thumbs up on your idiocy.
Jan, so no US sanctions is the correct response, or are you saying the Russian interference didn't even happen?
Go read #Wikileaks and then get back to me...
Explore Trump's finances. Putin owns him. Trump is engaged in treason.
citation needed
"Treason against United States, shall consist...or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort." Trump adheres.

Millions of Americans don't support this & want peace with the world. Voters remember.
@BernieSanders I am so proud of those who step up to defend our democracy. Keep up the good work Thank you
@JoyAnnReid @SenJohnMcCain Thank you, Senator. Please stay strong on this. Our country is counting on you.
You're endangering us all.
@pmesta7 @SenJohnMcCain President Putin won't be happy.
Thank you gentlemen! You are TRUE Republicans. #America
so are we gonna place regulations on our-self for interfering in other countries elections?
Remember when Lindsey said "They're gonna nuke S Carolina"?
Lindsey 2013: If we don't attack Assad, they're gonna nuke S Carolina. #LockUpLindsey with #CrookedHillary
Question? If we KNOW they interfered with the election how do the "results" stand. This is treason behavior
! @LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain Based on Lindsey's performance of zero support in the Republican primary, he won't be leading anyone.
@MarkSalter55 I absolutely support this.
@VanJones68 These two GOP leaders are doing more to stand against Trump than the  fraud Bernie Sanders! SAD
thank you as this is not a partisan issue but one that all Americans should share outrage in
thank you! Fight the good fight! Country before party!!
wonderful - this is the kind of leadership we need. not the denial that we've seen from @realDonaldTrump
+ Hearings on Trump campaign collision with Russia and his conflicts of interest.
stop promoting fake news. Stop promoting the Democrat strategy to disenfranchise Donald Trump. Trader Lynn
My heroes. My brave American heroes
thx for your RT IG.
EXCELLENT!! real patriots!!!
#GrabMelaniaByThePussy while you're at it @LindseyGrahamSC? @kittyFitz50 @SenJohnMcCain

Bravo!!!
Trump will take a look at it next week or sometime thereafter.
And yet Assange denies Russia's involvement.
Heard tonight that both of  u caved 2 McConnell regard'g independent review of Russian hack'g. What is /1
@SenateMajLdr trying to hide or is he&wife bought & paid4 by trump. Americans are watching very move 2/2
because the world needs another cold or even hot war, right? many thanks from those of us caught in between.
Hell yea! Regardless of party, people need to stand up for safety, fairness & honesty.
@pasandotiempo @SenJohnMcCain I applaud you. You gotta watch Trump. He's Putin's boy.  Watch your back. Thank you.
We REALLY should be having a new election! This is not legitimate!!
@pa @SenJohnMcCain it reeksnorms are not laws., Rs ransacked them.  We need to do some norm breaking ourselves
I hope that R's decide to take an ethical path @PA @SenJohnMcCain
. Ethical is not in Republican vocabulary. Turncoat, Russian loving Traitors
why do something when Obama's on his way out? You've had 8 yrs to do something to earn your pay!
thanks
@byrdinator @SenJohnMcCain Thank you Senator!
Why, Russia had nothing to do with the election. #nicetrythough
what stopped you from doing it earlier?
You mean help throw gas on the fire in an effort to help start war?
And I applaud you for initiating treason investigation on PEOTUS Trump for asking Russia for cyber attack
@WakeUpMFers @swargcoming Putin &  America are laughing at u. All alleged stuff and you want this? Pathetic!
Just remember Graham ran for POTUS too & got beaten. Making noise to be heard somehow.
.@LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain please call for an independent commission. I fear the #GOP leadership will ignore this.
hopes for saving this republic are in your hands. This is why you are here at this moment. Do not fail us
BACK OFF! WHAT BAGGAGE ARE YOU BOTH HOLDING TO ENGAGE IN THIS IDIOCY?
@johnsaltas @SenJohnMcCain You will, of course, release the evidence?
you're both relics. your time has passed. catch up with the rest of us or get out of the way.
how about look into Russian ties to your buddy, The Donald & his many pro-Russian cabinet selections
please, please, don't just move on, terrified of him.
@cponder1979 @SenJohnMcCain-Senators leave no stone unturned. The Russian hold on Trump threatens our Democracy.
justice must be met! We are a Democracy not be taken lightly.
Thank you both for your patriotism!
Thanks for standing up to Russia!
where were u on the Chinese OPM hack?
ISIS grew for 6 years ..taking over territory and moving at will until the Russians arrived ?  Why ?
Senators, this is the time for leadership.  I wish you both the best in this effort.
Nice that your spines are growing back after the campaign. @LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain
Some of your Republican friends, like @carlbunce haven't gotten the message :(
You guys rock!  Go, go, go!!!
Thank you sirs. We are frightened by recent events and need your leadership. @LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain

thank you!
- absolutely!
Pls get PEOTUS tax returns,for probable Russian partnerships listed on ScheduleE. Follow the money..
Thank you, Senator. We need more like you.
Thank you very much! Good to see someone with cohones in the Senate! @LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain @IvanCNN
Linda an Johnny boy want war so much there do anything.  @lindseygrahamsc @senjohnmccain
@France4Hillary @SenJohnMcCain While you're at it get rid of the puppet Putin elected & save us from destruction.
Thank you, both! :-)
How's that going to happen when the PEOTUS has declared himself the head of the V. Putin fan club? #conflict
@JoyAnnReid @SenJohnMcCain Intent to unless what? Sounds like we shd wait and see Hope you will allow sanctions to con't 
@ChrisiDoo222 @SenJohnMcCain How about Mitch McConnell?  Guess his ass is in a sling since his wife got a job
@politicalmiller @SenJohnMcCain
Be sure to check with Spicer on the "magnitude' levels.
@Evan_McMullin Thank you.  We'll be watching.
@JoyAnnReid @SenJohnMcCain. Thank you Sen Graham for being an American first!
@NormOrnstein @SenJohnMcCain Absolutely, thank you
@JoyAnnReid @SenJohnMcCain Lindsey, John, you gentlemen must be the voice of sanity for the party and the Republic.
Thank you, I was in need of a good laugh!
Bravo boys, do your job!!
Thank you 4 standing up for #American #Democracy it's nice to see that someone has the balls to do right 
I hope you will include any American collaborators.
I hope you are successful.
@maggiepriceless @SenJohnMcCain Good for you 
@AlamoOnTheRise @SenJohnMcCain There ARE some Patriots left in the GOP !
where?? #dutyhonorCounntry
Thank you Senator Graham and Senator McCain for your leadership.
@ChrisiDoo222 @SenJohnMcCain @realDonaldTrump Trump should never be President.
Thank you. I disagree with your politics &branch of service, but this Navy Chief salutes your patriotism.
As a conservative who is disgusted with today's GOP, I find a few rays of hope in statements like this.
I hope this comes back to bite you in your #Treasonous A$$es @LindseyGrahamSC & @SenJohnMcCain. The #truth's going out you both.
@lolosallu4ever @SenJohnMcCain THANK YOU SENATOR GRAHAM!
THANK YOU gentlemen--now if we could just educate #Trump "supporters" of the severity of this issue
Because John Podesta's email password was "password". Great reason to expel and sanction Russia. Right.
More of the same from two old establishment tools....I mean fools
Oh Lord, they are going to come over here and kill us all?!?!!
I urge you to reconsider unless you have evidence more compelling than what you've presented thus far.
We're counting on you b/c Trump will invite them back in, lift sanctions & sell us out to Russia!
@JoyAnnReid @SenJohnMcCain Good for you, sir, all of the GOP congress members who put country over party.
Thank you for standing up to Putin's satellite regime in Washington. You must resist.
@puppymnkey @SenJohnMcCain when does the investigation into trumps investments begin?  Foreign interests r killing US.
And you'll have no help from the Ass you just put in office. Thanks! You want our respect? Put McConnell in the hot seat
as an accessory to #treason
@SunflowerSoul71 @SenJohnMcCain   We'll  be watching. 2018, 2020
@rayann2320 @LindseyGrahamSC @SunflowerSoul71 @SenJohnMcCain these 2 worry about how the #MSM perceives them not #WeThePeople
of course you are cold war relics, newsflash dragon is rising
I  presume this means you will seek to indict all complicit and who lied about russian entanglements
Thanks to you both for standing up for the USA.
PLSE Make this effort a TOP PRIORITY due to #BookOfDaniel4 @realDonaldTrump TheDreamHasBeenFulfilled

If Republicans were to kill Obamacare, they'd hurt the states most that Trump won by just 74K votes combined. Good luck, gentlemen.
funny  where is the proof and don't we do this to other countries ?
thank you both from a dem.  while we may disagree on many things, I have no doubts re: your patriotism.
Yo, Blanche DuBois and Walnuts.....screw sanctions, get to the bottom the the crime!
Obvious a special investigation needs to be done on Trump's $$ ties to Russia, China etc too! @Hannajewel @SenJohnMcCain
What's the hold up?? Been asking for investigation for weeks!! WTF is the hold up??
I hope you have a food-taster. We know what Putin does.
@ColMorrisDavis @SenJohnMcCain Thank you senator!

Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do. Love!
how about you worry about blue collar jobs instead, do Obama's work later
and an independent update for the public so we can make our own judgment on our Pres elects involvement
It seems like our politicians have nothing better to do. Why do we even pay them?
Thank you, guys! I tend to vote Democratic, but we ALL need to stand together against Russian agression.
If you don't your tweets are as meaningless as Trump's. Stand up to Putin and Trump.Have some courage here.
ummm, so what is the secret information Trump has on the jack ng?  Call him out Senators -- please!!
I
Ooops..hacking
