lindsey graham   IF U TAKE AWAY 20 MILLION PEOPLE'S HEALTHCARE

I HOPE THEY ALL COME LOOKING FOR YOU
Pro-life, my ass. You peddle death -- one disabled American at a time. Shame on you. SHAME on you.
Wow fox news again...shocker
Disgusting bill, aimed at denying coverage to millions. FOR SHAME.
Care to explain trying to push through a health care bill with no hearings or CBO score.
Maybe you should ask Trump to stop sabotaging ACA.
Koch Bribe $$$ is calling  
What's in it for you? $30 towards re-election? Check in with your heart, daddy.

No conserv who cheers ripping away the insurance for babies born with critical diseases (for tax cuts) can EVER claim to be pro-life again.
Why don't you talk with someone who has KNOWLEDGE of bill.  Afraid.
Notably, Graham won't engage on the substance of Kimmel's argument, or allow for a CBO score that would tell us who's really lying. https://twitter.com/burgessev/status/910524514899038209 …
1/ Heartless policy, potentially devastating to so many, and even more shocking as your "friend" @SenJohnMcCain battles cancer...
2/ You could have taken up his call to restore order to the Senate, worked with him to write a bill that everyone could be proud to support.
3. Instead, you ignored the stand he and others took and have pushed this issue to the brink again. Sadly, we all see exactly who you are.
Going on FOXNEWS and Breibart shows you are a SELL OUT, BEEN BOUGHT, I AM ASHAMED TO BE FROM SC.
You have disappointed me. I thought you represented the people in the US, no matter what party. I was wrong.  
How will you sleep at night after you cut off hc for millions because you chose politics over policy.
STOP giving BENEFITS  to ILLEGALS & those HEALTHY enough to GET A DAMN JOB & pay for their OWN healthcare they need to CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING
POFS fem
Why bother all we see is a grainy video of you doing unspeakable things and saying yes Mr President. Is that how you like it Mr President?
I like much of what you stand for Mr Graham except this repeal/replace crap...it only sets us back to Big Ins raking us over coals
"Killing sick child by kicking them off Medicare because it's Socialism" should be the new @GOP slogan.
BANNON?? STEVE FUCKING BANNON?? YOU KNOW FULL WELL WHAT HE IS. I RESPECTED YOU. NO MORE. SHAME ON YOU ALL! WE DON'T WANT YOUR CRAP BILL!
I'm going to kill people!  Yay Republicans!
I would sooner eat dirt!
Who gives a damn????
THESE MEN ARE LIARS @BillCassidy  @LindseyGrahamSC
JUST IN: American Medical Association comes out against new ObamaCare repeal bill http://hill.cm/UrYXlMA  
This will leave people more vulnerable. What about preexisting conditions?

#GreatReads: The staggering hypocrisy of Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham: http://bit.ly/2xkjGXg  @mattyglesias 
Fox News is fake news. Just like you are a fake senator.
Of course you will you craven lunatic.

If your bill passes generations will point to you as the person who killed their sick ailing relative.
Speak to real news and answer hard questions not bias fox
Have you no shame?

If you too are disappointed in Sen @BillCassidy #GrahamCassidy let them know it - call (202) 224-3121 
Telling us what a cold-hearted poor excuse for a human you are and not telling us if you're invested financially in the end of ACA.
U people r deplorable allowing the idiot threaten nuclear war on a Korea at UN meeting! Do something about him & stop trying to take HC away
Look out for your own interest Lindsey.

Our @will_c_fischer says #GrahamCassidy is just #TrumpCare with a new name and still takes health care away from thousands of #veterans. 
Don't forget to lie. That's what you do best.
Follow the money and I'm sure it'll lead right to Lindsey Graham. Complicit.
Time to be rid of trump and his entourage, leave health care alone.
On how he is going to screw the American people.


Discussing illness as a commodity???
I'd hate for those poor CEO's to miss a bonus because they couldn't double the fees for your diabetic cousin.
Stop wasting tax dollars #partisanpolticsatitsfinest #singlepayerhealthcarenow #foxnewsisfakenews
Keep talking Graham, pass that bill whatever until you jam it up your bases butt and really hurt them we won't get you out.
Will you speak with cancer survivors on Medicaid expansion?
NO!!! to your death bill that will harm/kill women, children, poor, elderly, disabled & vets.
Linds - don't follow this path
you are cutting people off their care
it will not be good
About how much you want to kill the poor and middle class? #LindseyGrahamsATraitor #GrahamCassidyNO
