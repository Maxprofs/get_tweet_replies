It's better than a fix. It's throwing healthcare in the trash and hoping you have the money to buy new. Oops. 700 billion to the military.
No it's a death sentence to millions & a gift to the Koch brothers. The Repubs have sold our democracy to the highest bidder.
Lie!!!

Sure.  It will make the Koch Brothers happy & they will open the piggy bank again.
You trust our state government to do what's right when so many of them are under investigation for doing wrong? No. The answer is no.
Could you please retweet an article or endorsement from an actual medical professional group? I'll wait.
You talk rubbish. This is all about your little Washington games to destroy the Obama legacy. Where is the CBO report. Where is the debate?
All 50 Medicaid directors come out against GOP bill to repeal ObamaCare
Koch brothers own http://you.You 're a public servant,get paid a salary via taxpayers but that's not enough,is it? @LindseyGrahamSC
Even among Republicans consensus seems to be that the bill sucks, only they’re desperate to prove that they can actually pass legislation.
No, they get campaign donations from Koch's
You're insane!
We do know who Andy Slavit is you know
@LindseyGrahamSC  They are desperate to pass this because they're afraid of losing money from their rich masters.
#GOP Time is Running Out! Get rid of #Obamacare Now! Last chance before 2018! #GrahamCassidy @SenJohnMcCain @RandPaul @MikeLeeforUtah
Then STOP TALKING AND PASS THE DAMNED THING!!! Words, words, words....we're tired of words!!
Full Repeal! Do what you promised!
GrahamCassidy is an Abomination being shoved Down the Throat of Americans. The Rush to Vote is How Republicans Compensate for Lack of a Plan

No it is not and it will not pass.

It is not - it's only better because it's no longer on your plate.  No longer on your plate, but forever on your mind.
You. Are. Lying. Fake news.

No, no it's not. I call BS. Show the study of who loses coverage.
No.
Hey there Lindsey do u actually ever RT factual news? This is tot BS.
How does allowing insurers to deny prenatal care reconcile with republican's pretense that a fetus is a life that should be protected?
#lindseygraham  hard to say I'm disappointed bc I never truly believed your lip service to compassion but this travesty is depressing. Shame
More lies from @GOP & @LindseyGrahamSC.
This is nothing but a grift. You're as bad as @realDonaldTrump. I'd always thought better of you @LindseyGrahamSC
Lies!
It must be terrific if you'll allow Alaska to keep #ACA. Trump's lies paved the way for GOP lies. Defeat #GrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidyNO

All 50 states. https://twitter.com/aslavitt/status/911018434804068352 …
You don't even know what's in it
AARP, AMA, BCBS, etc etc all disagree. But what do THEY know about healthcare/costs?
When Republicans lose control of Congress I guess we'll see then huh?
Lies
Seriously?   Passage of a bill should at least REQUIRE you to step outside the echo chamber and talk to the other tribe.
You repeating lies is right out of the Goebbels playbook! Your bill is nothing but a tax break for the 1% who own you! SMH!
Liar  #GrahamCassidy
Avalere, a consulting firm, modeled Graham-Cassidy's cap on Medicaid over time. Look what it does to children and the disabled. SAVAGE. 

BREAKING: The bipartisan Medicaid Directors from all 50 states just issued this negative statement about Graham-Cassidy.…
Admission of just how bad the bill will be for the rest of the country. http://ijr.com/2017/09/979983-republicans-attempt-buy-murkowskis-vote-new-draft-health-care-bill/ … …
You make me sick!  And soon I won't be able to afford to go to the Dr just because you want a win.
No  One  Believes  You

PS. Stop showing us your O face. Eww.
Great pic, Blanche/Linsey. Trump's a "dotard.
Unless you're one of the millions who will lose coverage.
REPEAL IT! My costs tripled in two years!! There is no "fix"! Now the state will destroy my coverage instead of the federal gov doing it.
more welfare,debt and broken promises of fixing it later while bailing out insurance companies. just repeal already gee whiz how stupid
Seriously??
NR should launch a network in which each program is similar in format to Crossfire w William F. Buckley. US needs better political discourse
Please do a story on @DrRandPaul instead?
