@LindseyGrahamSC @VP Making progress on crushing HARD WORKING Americans to make the Top 1% richer? Koch $ Not #MAGA #DrainTheSwamp

Willing to kill citizens to be a star. 

$700B military funding okay but will pull plug on services to keep people alive.
Healthcare is a right and we pay for it with our tax money.  Do you realize what will happen to millions of people? Fix the ACA!!!!

A bill -- finalized yesterday, has not been scored, amendments not allowed, and 3 hours final debate -- should be viewed with caution.
Progress to be destroyers of the US and the world. Congrats.
AP: People with pre-existing conditions, pregnant women among those who lose out in #GrahamCassidy bill. VOTE NO!
Do it - GOP owns utter chaos& parents not able to care 4 seriously ill kids. GOP will own all that. Your Win=TempWin followed by utter FAIL
You suck as  human being, Lindsey.

No conserv who cheers ripping away the insurance for babies born with critical diseases (for tax cuts) can EVER claim to be pro-life again.
Yes killing people because you take away their healthcare is making progress. This bill is horrible.
Making progress to kill someone like me bcs I have preexisting Conditions that I can't help!! You should have the same options u r giving us
You should be ashamed trying to take away the health care for the ones they need it the most!!
And I thought there was only one Grim Reaper...

A bill -- finalized yesterday, has not been scored, amendments not allowed, and 3 hours final debate -- should be viewed with caution.
@LindseyGrahamSC & Pence > when Pence goes down will Lindsay follow?
Cruel
#America The #GOP doesn't give a f*€k about you. You are about to see when you find out you're sick, but can't go to the  doctor!

Under this bill, pregnancy will cost you an extra 17K. Metastatic cancer 172K. Autism 5K. Asthma 4K. This isn't a healthcare bill.
@LindseyGrahamSC @VP making progress for the KOCH BROTHERS? Koch'  are the only Americans you represent, it appears.
Progress for whom? Not the American people who will be hurt by your cruel and pathetic healthcare bill.
HOw many Hospital officals ,insurance companies ,senior citizens , poor people did you ask questions to about HEALTHCARE??
You really are sounding unhinged on health coverage. Is Trump's craziness contagious?
Not for millions of Americans. Did u think we'd stop watching? Did you think we'd stop resisting. U were elected to take care of Americans!

How was your salad, Senator Graham? I'm tossing mine thinking about what you call "progress"
...to kick millions off health care and gut Medicaid.
Just another day of fucking every day americans over.
Progress to what, Lindsey Graham selling out for an ambassadorship?
You are not, this is backwards, defense increases and death increases for Americans...
Progress towards what - making people worry again that they'll be denied coverage bc of a pre-existing condition or lifetime cap? 
Vote the heartless SOBs out! We deserve the same insurance they have, top line and free!  #OustRepublicans2018
well sure, if your goal is to harm people on purpose, u r indeed making progress.
You mean regression.
"By taking healthcare away from the most vulnerable"  @LindseyGrahamSC says as pushes the most devastating legislation against sick&poor ..
Progress would suggest that more people would have equal or better coverage under the new plan than have it today. This isn't progress.
Appears you are dancing madly backwards
I used to think Lindsey Graham was decentnThus Healthcare bill is just as evil as the other repyb bills. SHAME ON ALL REPUBL SENATORS
Still nothing on PE conditions. It's a loser #GrahamCassidyDeathBill

Lindsey Graham is a sycophant, not worthy to tie @SenJohnMcCain 's shoelaces. How is this  a return to regular order?
Jerks
Says the fucking traitor(s) - give us CBO score, a real one!
Come on, get over yourself and your testosterone need to play politics. Fix ACA
Watch the VIDEO. Find out what is really in the bill. On @MSNBC with @JRubinBlogger
So proud to throw grannies out of the nursing homes and sick kids under the bus. So Christian of the Republicans
You crazy incurious idiot you & your idiots had better know ALL Americans pay taxes & I say we don't go with your phony Healthcare, no NO.
It doesn't matter what ms Lindsey Graham says or does back here in South Carolina he needs to go he has failed us done with him
NEW:Let's be clear. These are hardball tactics.

Republicans say repeal or nothing.People be damned.

#GreatReads: The staggering hypocrisy of Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham: http://bit.ly/2xkjGXg  @mattyglesias 
Translation: "We're progressing greed is good capitalism & profits over people," says @VP as he contemplates the next sinister thing to do.
That's a joke, right? You are no patriot!
@LindseyGrahamSC @VP you guys are just as intimidated by President Obama as your so-called POTUS which is why you are doing this to USA
Progress taking away pre existing cond coverage, substance use disorder aka opioids treatment as optional. Real winners!#HealthCareForAll
'My party has gone batshit crazy.' @LindseyGrahamSC . Ah, Senator we couldn't have said it better ourselves.
Why are you repealing ACA again?Massaging ur male ego by repealing my insurance is cruel&make no mistake,your rhetoric isn't fooling anyone
Well, fabulous for you but we all will be stuck with the disastrous health care policy you are pushing.  YOU will have the same great care!
Looking forward to screwing the American people. You folks should be ashamed but I guess Koch money is more important than we are.

Our @will_c_fischer says #GrahamCassidy is just #TrumpCare with a new name and still takes health care away from thousands of #veterans.

Oh, #WeReadIt. Section 106 allows states to waive underwriting req's. Insurers could charge through the roof for preexisting conditions.
