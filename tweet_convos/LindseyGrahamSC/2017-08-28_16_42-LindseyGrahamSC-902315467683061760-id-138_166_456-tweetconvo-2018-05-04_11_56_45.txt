Odd it happens when new #TrumpRussia news hits, right? Every time...
I don't understand why Congress and the president are not getting together to discuss some of this.  is it because you all can't keep quiet?
DT too busy talking about ratings... has no idea at all what to do about NK & neither does House. Would be nice to have a real State Dept
Let's DO THIS
I was really starting to admire you but these statements are getting ridiculous.   ACT!!!!!
he needs to be stoped
Only a matter of time until that fool takes THE shot at us. We better be ready..... Ready to end it with extreme measures.
Yeah and Dumbo won't do one damn helpful thing. He's a freaking lunatic pretending to be a president!
Trump is a weak leader.  Our enemies and allies alike know this.  #25thAmendmentNow
So should I grab my daughter and my wife and her whole Korean family and leave Seoul tomorrow, Sen warmonger?
Oooo... NK is so scared of Trump. What a Statesman. What a negotiator. What a Leader. Not, not & not. Stop protecting him. He is ruining us.
Wait, I thought Trump said that North Korea was starting to respect us?  Are you saying that the President was wrong?
Russia attacked us w YOUR president's help. Deal w that. #impeachtrump or consider yourself a Russian ally
That's twice they have crossed the red line set by DT, where is the Republican outrage? Guess DT is grabbing himself by the pu$$y!
Trump is a big escalation of conflict
The Potus should be tweeting this, not you!
We should have a "screamer" missile we could send over Un's office. That would get the message to him without actually blowing him up yet.
You Americans really only feel important if you could trigger wars don't you?  This is utter stupidity.
Every time there is big Russia news Here comes a North Korea missle
WAR MONGER.
Trump is still going to be prosecuted. No smoke screen will cover it up. Stop with the shock politics and stick to humor. You're good at it.
That's it worry about North Korea. How about problems at home like 2 failed nuclear reactors and a terrible President?
Excuse me, what's this have to do with the President? Hello?
Russia and China have more control over North Korea than us. Sanctions aren't working. What is next? Diplomacy? OrWar?
Wait a minute.. haven't heard from the other WAR MONGER John McCain yet!!!
@SenJohnMcCain
and just what is the U.S. going to do to respond to this grave threatening behavior? We've allowed this man to run amuck
But... but... but... last week you were telling us that @realDonaldTrump 's tweets had gotten Kim to back down. Guess not. #UnfitForOffice
Isn't it time to try the THAAD system?  Better to shoot down a test flight over an allied country than when it has a nuclear warhead on it.
Nothing could have stopped that NK missile because it was flying above the max ceiling of SM-3 at the time it passed over Japan.
Why do you guys always get boners when War is a possibility? Always rushing to bomb this or that.
Senator Graham, in this conflict, there will be no winners. Apocalyptic end for everyone..
@LindseyGrahamSC Do you, in your heart, truly trust trump to take us into a war with NK??
what are you today Lindsey, a republican or a democrat ?

Today, 54 years since MLK's "I Have a Dream” speech, let us pledge to never lose sight of his vision of racial and economic justice. 
absolutely,I&my great beauty @margbrennan condemned any missile test by N>korea .provocation in region,resolve issue through talks,dialogue
Don't push for a war when we have crazy in the WH.  Peace is the answer.
Not our dog, not our fight. But if u want fight go for it.
If you're serious about protecting our country, find a way to remove the idiot in Chief, you know, the guy you support 100%, from office 
Bigly?
Only if you were as excited for #MAGA as you are for war!
Lindz, I'm starting to question your judgement
Can we maybe not encourage Trump to say anything to North Korea again? Considering the last time he brought us to brink of nuclear war
WHEN U'VE GOT NOTHING U'VE GOT NOTHING TO LOSE. GO DOWN SWINGING. GO DOWN IN A BLAZE OF GLORY.
This I agree with you Sen.  It's time to stand our ground if show strength.
Kimjunkpoops has made his intentions clear! Either time out or spanking????
Mayb U.S. can tell Russia 🛇 giving NK missiles 2 agitate U.S. & our allies. Months ago NK cldn't get a missile 2 go, now it's point & shoot
.u backed @realDonaldTrump all the way. This is the result now u & republican congress own it
Senator Graham, get over yourself, you aren't @POTUS, you lost so quit trying to tell him what he should do. He's quite capable by himself
Sen Graham, can you not even fathom that your Pres is a Russian partner?? Where is the country above party idea??? I am so amazed at you!!!
What did you expect with Trump's incendiary tweets, comments,  and threats? Impeach Trump before he launches WWIII. #ImpeachTrump
Quit saber rattling.
Oh poor Lindsey, you lost most of us at the "I have 100% confidence on the president" comment.
And Japan needs to respond! Not the USA.
What's the answer? War? Millions dead?
Lindsey,  can we at least finish one war before we start another.
Can't believe you are actually suggesting we go to war with NK?!?  What are you thinking?  C'mon Senator Graham...spill the beans.
Given the timing/breaking news it smacks of engineered distraction. Let's not go to war to save a president most of the country wants out.
Lol you want Pence? The ultimate GOP example
I'd prefer Mattis. It's going to be a Republican until we get to election. I hear Pence has a short exp date too though.
No, no escalation to war. Trump admin is corrupt and has not done enough to avoid. No war!
"Big time escalations sanctions aren't working" Reps code for we should start a war with N Korea & impose our will on them
Um ! We are relying on the same bunch of idiots that brought us Iraq 1,2 & Afghanistan the 17 yr old war that never stops absorbing
American lives and money to this current day. But again you Linsey Graham , john McCain and a bunch of other idiots always willing
Willing to sanction the next war bet if you ask these same dudes are they willing to send their sons & daughters to fight they might think
Might think twice before always running to another country and risking American lives in these wars , unless they are making $$ of the wars
What else are you Reps good at other then  promoting the current racial divide of this country & being war mongers
So Lindsey let's nuke em. Your answer for every conflict.
I lost respect for you.
... Lindsey never met a war he didn't want to start... The man is a complete psychotic buffoon.
Thanks for your analysis Brilliantly displayed

We know that! What will YOU do for the country's benefit? Trumputin's a sell out!
Please set example & try not to tweet about this- not everyone can Tweet with restraint. (Trump)!
Grow some Mr. Graham and get rid of Trump before he destroys not only this country but the world.
You're in for a big surprise.....soon.....enjoy the calm!
Trump is a weak leader and our enemies and allies alike know it.  #25thAmendmentNow
restraint at this time is in order
Trumps busy trying to find some Nazis & Russian to pardon.
Do us all a big favor and don't whip up a frenzy until we have a president who is less unstable than NK's.
Don't get @realDonaldTrump all fired up we won't have to worry about floods, we will all be dead from nuclear war
@LindseyGrahamSC try and NE intelligent enough to come up with solutions other then war
@LindseyGrahamSC you always push for war whenever something happens. What is your personal benefit? I'm guessing you will make money off it.
"Violation of Japan's sovereign territory and airspace", "an act of war", no?
Oh really? Trump just said today that Kim & Co. are starting to respect us. Another imagined Trumpism.
They didn't fire it over us.
.... North Korea has every right to test fire ICBM... We tested one last week.
Well yeah, but dont shoot it towards japan
Kinda hard not to. I guess u r not familiar with a map? Tell me where they are going to shoot it? do you want it to land in China or sea?
Due south off their western peninsula flies over no one... Check it on a map if u don't believe me
... What are you talking about it flies towards Taiwan and the Philippines
If u cant aim it that well... Of course it might, but then again you shouldn't launch it if u cant aim
... Obviously they aimed well they did not hit Japan. Why is it that U.S. can test weapons but NK can't?
Wag that dog!
Shh Lindsey don't get Trump worked up again.
Just stop. It's a distraction. Trump news getting too hot, so NK fires a missile. Stop saber rattling.
An escalation of what conflict?
So is stating there are good neo nazis
Why aren't you this concerned with your POTUS obstructing Justice and all the lies he tells?
Get tax reform done, repeal Obamacare, build the wall and shut up.
F U
If you want war go and fight. too much hell already in this evil world ,made evil by some no damn good congressmen.
#HELLWITHWAR!
you think so?
Maybe?
it was sarcasm
Sen Graham,not that i am a big fan of our President, by any stretch, but this is on N.Korea, not President Trump.They will not listen 2 any1
Hmmm. Seems 2 happen when Trumps troubles r on the rise. Saturday 3, during  hurricane.2day when he got busted,again,4 lying. #ImpeachTrump
And Trump's threats didn't escalate anything?
So what are you going to do, start a nuclear war? Gtfoh
every time NK does a missile it is because #TrumpRussia story drops by NYT ans WaPo. Wake up! Pay Attention! #ImpeachTrump
You're a chickenshit.
Called idiot trump's bluff. But what, precisely, do you recommend we do?
Probably gives Lindsey a hard on.
Four launches since tRUMP swiped the presidency. And you called President Obama weak on NK? Gimme a break.
Only if you are determined to use it as an excuse to start WW3

Please confiscate Trump's phone. We don't need more talk of FIRE and FURY! Let the diplomats handle this and NOT through TWITTER. You too!
Kim Jong Un just poked Trump because he knows Trump can't walk and chew gum at the same time.  That is about to become very obvious.
Graham do you think it's4 Congress 2 stop acting like a bunch of crys bashing our @POTUS & start working with him instead of against him?
So I ask you what scenario do you have in which 2,000,000 don't die, even wo nucks nkorea has 6,000 howitzers on dmz.this bs strengthens him
Why isn't the media reporting it? Did you and your dems not give them permission?
Please he has the code. Don' t give him any idea.
I see you can take time out of your "busy" schedule for this but not the systematic dismantling of our constitution by the idiot trump. 
I wish you were president Mr. Graham.. At least I could sleep at night , knowing there is not a lunatic at the helm..
And the trannies would celebrate ;)
Trump stirred this up and then stepped aside.
China is still has a oil pipeline to NK, needs to be shut off.
Mr Bannon, whom you allowed to be in the White House, told them military action was not an option. He told the whole world.
keep your head
Thank God you are not our president I would be devastated if you were The president of my child's daycare center
Nuke the egg roll
Lindsey Russia news comes out, Russia/Trump need diversion, say fire a missile, Did you, Ryan and McConnell take money from Russians?
Strike now
You suck what?
You mean "fire and fury" and "locked and loaded" didn't deter them?! Imagine that!
@SenJohnMcCain will be against it
And what's Trump going to do about it Mr. Graham?? Nothing that's what! He's busy tweeting about his wins to be concerned with N. Korea
Your used to what @BarackObama did YOU FOOL!! @POTUS is allowing the #NorthKorea n clown to hang himself with a paper trail. #WipedOUTSOON
Mind your business
You will have to wait til the ratings opportunity is right for the US to react!
Maybe you should tell Obama to go home since clearly he's the one behind all this!!
Capt obvious
Pls dont say words like that, president will act upon it and blame u for saying so
More statements Lindsey? BFD!
Grow a pair and ACT!
Learn how to thread.
