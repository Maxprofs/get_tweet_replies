EPA head Pruitt spent $12,000 taxpayer $ traveling home this spring  & has yet to visit any of his regional offices.
With luck, pollution will choke up small waterways and wetlands to a point where they won't exist anymore, and then we can MINE COAL
I hope that hiring more scientist came up.
How I feel about you everyday scott. #resist
Is this true?
You obviously care nothing for our state. So disappointed in you Lindsey.

Disgusting crew.
Values defined= corporate profits over human life
Proud of Senator Graham and Congressman Wilson.

Fight like our world depends on it. Join me in the movement to save our home and see @aitruthfilm https://fandan.co/2tK8VLZ  
UGH!
Almost 117 million Americans draw their drinking water from streams protected by WOTUS. Are you pledging to protect them or allow pollution?

Why don't you come to MA with @SenMarkey or CA with @SenKamalaHarris and get an education why you should resign and return to OK
Terrible men!
Discussing how you can get away with dumping even more pollutants in our water?

90% of @EPAScottPruitt's taxpayer funded travel has been to Oklahoma. We're calling for @US_OSC to investigate: https://www.americanoversight.org/news/call-osc-investigation-pruitt-travel-oklahoma … 
Question: Will repealing #WOTUS allow to pollute drinking water with fertilizers and leave the costs of cleaning it to taxpayers?
Which environmental groups are you meeting with?
You committed perjury. You lied under oath to senators, and you were rewarded with a job.
Climate change is real protect our country protector worldhttps://twitter.com/algore/status/889598418603184131
Planning on poisoning SC residents?
But Graham won't hold a single healthcare Town Hall. Deplorable!
Liars, crooks, thieves, traitors.  God forgive you.
Here's th group that is taking apart safeguards f the American people and the environment solely for th economic benefit of big business. 
You need to stop lying to the American ppl and officially change name to Environmental Exploitation Agency. Craven.
Did EPA Chief Scott Pruitt just say his mission is to dismantle the agency while increasing oil&gas production? http://bit.ly/2tX2y5a 
Bunch of greedy WATER POLLUTERS!!! 
#letsreplayflintmichigan
Can you explain to me the feeling that you are getting by killing your grandchildren?
Don't sell out clean water in American just so you and big business can skate responsibility to minimize impacts to #health & #environment
#WOTUS? Wankers of the United States?
Still waiting on you to meet with pro-environment groups...
Looks like you are working very hard to deconstruct the EPA.  Please consider SC coastline, wildlife and tourism.
Come And See How Sick The Mentally Disabled Tenants Are On Superfund Site Treasure Island With Arsenic And Hazardous Chemicals/ (:- (
Allowing companies to destroy our environment one state at a time.
Waters of the US (#WOTUS)...so basically you want to pollute more waterways and are meeting w/ other people that also want to pollute.
right...our senator will meet with big money but wont bother to meet with his constituents. SC needs a new senator in 2018.
You have meetings with everyone but actual scientists. People who have DATA & FACTS & EXPERIENCE at the work you SHOULD be doing.
You've probably never heard of WOTUS but it could have serious drinking water implications |

Was there a representative, or two, from @scdhec? If not, then the meeting was a total waste of time for SC.

So joined by a bunch if people who know jack all about the science and importance of protecting our water...
Yay! You found a woman to be in yr meeting this time! Not all white men. 
Next up: some ordinary people who like to breathe and drink water!
so good to see some of my favorite people together
#ResignNow
What aspect of reality are you debating now? 
ANY discussion about BILLIONS of $ spent poisoning US citizens 24/7? #GeoEngineering #Chemtrails @realDonaldTrump @Scaramucci #MAGA
Wish I could handpick & only meet with people who agree with my opinion. Meanwhile the rest of us want CLEAN AIR & WATER, not $$ 4 Cronies
Please do the right thing and don't deprive Americans of Health Care while you develop a better system... fix what we have!
No one makes environmental and women's health care decisions better than a bunch of old right-wing white guys!
You prefer a bunch of elderly blood stained extreme left wing men?
No. You?
No, just clarifying.
Is it humid there? Looks very swampy to me...
Y'all left some important folks out of this. Convenient. Guess you're too scared to debate them bc you're a fraud.

Resign @EPAScottPruitt
So more meetings with industry insiders. You will not protect the environment, so resign immediately
