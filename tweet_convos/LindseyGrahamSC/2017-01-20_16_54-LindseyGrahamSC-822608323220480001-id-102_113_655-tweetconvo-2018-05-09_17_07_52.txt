Now all he has to do is listen.. But he knows more then our General's
#DirtyDon
#ThinSkinPrez
you assume the pres will take advice of others. #TrumpLies
although I worry he may not actually value it.
as a democrat I truly appreciated you reaching across the aisle & standing up for basic human decency on the Daily Show.
if he listens....
that's because mattis won't betray his country. How about trump?
@mindyfinn 

Please protect us from Russia, senator.
@JWGOP which @realDonaldTrump then will leak to his bff Putin. Yay!
Really want my country safe, have sons serving. We are concerned about ties to Russia. This choice good one!
@LaVerneWright13 If he takes it. That's unlikely.
TO RESOLVE THE CRISIS. FREE THE HOSTAGES N BRING JUSTICE TO THE VICTIMS. N RAPTURE ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS WHO CHOOSES.
Will he tell him not to pull troops from the Baltics? The Russians will compromise that relationship and you know it.
THANK YOU FOR THE POLITICAL COURAGE AND LEADERSHIP YOU ARE SHOWING... a democratic voter
I'm just worried that he won't actually take said advice.
@mindyfinn if he chooses to listen to it.
Yes if the moron ever listens to any one else 
I am ashamed of my country. Those poor children. What has become of us?
Republicans push unwilling Taiwan into war for independence
How many Marines will US send to re-take JinMen?

.@LindseyGrahamSC @DeptofDefense "@SenJohnMcCain He [#Mattis] is a forthright strategic thinker. His integrity is unshakable&unquestionable"
Senator Graham please influence the President to listen to Gen Mattis!
Let us pray that #TrumpPresident will follow that advice.
I WILL WORK WITH THE BUSH ADMIN IN WHATEVER WAY POSSIBLE TO RESOLVE THE CRISIS. FREE THE HOSTAGES N BRING JUSTICE TO THE
Thank you for joining our President to help save our country.
please don't vote for DeVry for education...so many issues
From your mouth to God's ear.
If he takes any advice at all.
@Eccentrie It's our hope that you will not be an obstructionist thwarting President Trump's efforts to revitalize the USA.
we can only hope he will actually take it
Well, only if he listens.

 @cspanwj #UniteBlue #NotMyPOTUS
So true!
traitor
Unfortunately, The Chump does not seem to follow advice...#Trumpocalypse
but Trump knows more than the generals. Why will he listen to them?
General Mattis will more likely get fed up with th'guy playing at being leader o'th'free world & eat him alive.Then resign.
really??
That's if he'll take it. Questionable.
That would only be so if Trump would take anyone's advice.
@realDonaldTrump doesn't take advice.  He's smarter than all the generals. 
why
you hope.
thanks for not letting Russia get away undermining this country with trump or anyone else.  This is our USA. THANKS
@EllenOTauscher how's that investigation into ties with Russia? We expect u to move forward w/ investigation as promised
I care more about what you and @SenateMajLdr think.
@JWGOP Quite the implied threat from @LindseyGrahamSC . Though not unwarranted.
this guy?
that is if Potus listens?
@EllenOTauscher we can only hope a the orange anus listens to him
boy I sure hope @realDonaldTrump listens to #mattis, sanity's last hope
@JWGOP Assumes he'll take it. Facts not in evidence.
I sure as hell hope he does cuz Trump is insane.
@JWGOP Do you think he will take his advice? Serious question.
Only if it agrees with his agenda
That's my thoughts. He doesn't listen to anyone because he's such a narcissist that he knows everything.
@JWGOPhe Well, he does consult with himself on issues like foreign policy because he has “a very good brain.”
is he eligible to take the job? @OfficeGovEthics @SenateDems
yes-exception for him -passsed.
you know more about this subject than I do - I'm sure you used your best discretion.  Deny DeVos
@JWGOP.    Trump only listens to President Javanka.
@JWGOP   Thank goodness there are strong people to offset the idiocracy
@ggrushko   Think Duggary is abound!
Believe he will as he & Pompeo may be the only 2 in the cabinet to keep this from becoming Tyranny & start of Kleptocracy
@mindyfinn I think Mattis is the only pick most Americans agree on.
He will put America first and will not follow illegal orders.
inshallah
His first action should be get rid of those terrorist @LindseyGrahamSC
BOOOOOOO! You know Trump is illegitimate, and that Mattis is hardly a civilian, and should not be running the DOD #LoveArmy
he might find it invaluable but will be used it
Yes . . . if Trump ever listened to advice.
@mindyfinn that way, he might do his job and read them daily.
@mindyfinn Pray he pays attention to it. And that Mattis talks in Bulletin points. Maybe if they gave Trump intel briefings
@mindyfinn lying to and about a man as honorable as Mattis is unwise. I wouldnt reccomend taking the USMarines for granted.
@mindyfinn If he listens to him!
@mindyfinn 

what would you know about leadership?
Yes only normal one! You need to Investigate Trump! NOW! And Bannon plz do your job & protect democracy
Predict Mad Dog will resign in disgust with the first year.
isn't @realDonaldTrump smarter than generals? Why do you think he will listen to Gen. Mattis?
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AOHeOKaybcc … Please tell #Mattis and @POTUS @realDonaldTrump the facts about PYD/PKK/YPG terrorits is the same
Let's hope he listens and doesn't think he knows more than Gen Mattis!  Please keep investigation going on Russia ties
Donald Trump taking advice? Not a chance!
absolutely cuz Trump has no leadership,needs all the help he can get, just saying!
I will give you that one.  Mattis is an excellent choice.  Calm mind in turbulent times.
@DorvalTony Pleased you are positive & supportive.  Canada may need America
#Russia celebrating #inauguration having parties& minting gold coin with Trump's image while our NATO parters R STUNNED
by #POTUS inaugural address THIS ISNT THE #UnitedStatesofRussia
How about you start supporting America first because you're embarrassing real military members everywhere.
Including his endorsement of the Iran treaty?
How in the hell did u lose to Trump
I would've voted for u in a second
Please keep the manboy in check
Maybe you and he can talk sense to POTUS about Russia.
If he will listen to his advice and therein lies the problem.
thanks for positive remarks
we know that, glad you understand. Foreword now, all together
Let's hope he also acts on the advice. We shall see soon #russianinfluence #russianhacking #sanctions
Can he stop @realDonaldTrump from using nukes over twitter nonsense? I sure hope so. We're counting on you, Gen.
Love seeing Gen. Mattis as SECDEF & love hearing POTUS say radical Islamic terrorism. Now let's get down to business.
I agree. Now the game has changed. Produce results, not promise, not hope. ACTION/RESULTS!
Hopefully it's not your style of leadership
Sir, you are sounding suckupity ....
Only if he listens to it.
