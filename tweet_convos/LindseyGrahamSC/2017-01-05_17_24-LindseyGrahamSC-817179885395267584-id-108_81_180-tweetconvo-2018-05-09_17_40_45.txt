Bipartisan group of senators call for repealing UN resolution on Israel http://dlvr.it/N2MQnB 
maybe they can stop stealing land from Palestinians, that would help immensely. Palestine has a right to defend themselves
If they're stealing any land from Palestinians just stealing what was their's in first place. Read history. Beginning with Moses.
then give Texas back to the Native Americans who were there before cheesy white grandma
Cheesy white grandma? LMBO well I wouldn't have much choice if American Indians rebelled and took country back. Maybe I'll get to keep mine
it would be a beautiful thing to see Mexico retake Texas too
I don't think the native Mexicans in Texas would like that. Most I know will tell you that they aren't Mexicans they're Americans.
Israel just got more money then ever from the USA.we should put that $ to our schools or medical
Lindsey why don't you get a job at McDonalds where you could do something beneficial ?
Main reason UN needs to be defunded along with PP.
yeah, the day you watch the IDF bulldoze your house because your nephew you never talk to is with Hamas, you'll side w/ UN.
@TimesofIsrael Sounds like U are turning against the precious new world order u &your BFF BAE good buddy McCain talk about
Evil cells of 1%  "Placing" Puppets in America & Europe War Profits & Genocides. #ElectionHacked #USINTEL #TrumpSwampWorld
@TimesofIsrael We must stand with and for Israel!
@TimesofIsrael you're hearing yesterday was propaganda we don't believe you for the CIA
And you support Israel regardless of illegal settlements and international condemnation.  Shame on you.
@TimesofIsrael false flag... more Jew propaganda. Poisioning water supplies , murder, rape, organ harvesting, no ertez!!!
Who is this "UN" you talk about - do you mean the member states of the countries of the world?
IDF is an occupying force, a legitimate target. What's wrong with military persons being killed in a war?
But they shoot kids throwing stones. Not good PR.
At some point, one has to ask, why the terrorist attacks, why the rockets fired? Israel is not without blood on their hands
I think they're the bad guy in this because they violated UN law with their settlements. Just my guess though ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
wonder why our spineless senators feel they have to be led by Israel. Wonder if it has to do with AIPAC $$
Like, I'm all for Israel and Jewish pride, just don't break the law. And they broke the law. Pretty simple logic
But most Republicans dont care about laws
How about this law...
Maybe if they stopped their criminal activity people would have a bit more concern about those attacks.
They were violating international law, of course they were condemned.
Truth told, no one should be punished for defending themselves on their own land, especially not our allies.
.@LindseyGrahamSC @TimesofIsrael Are we sure Israel did not try to hack other countries PC to rig elections? Sounds Russian to me. #MSNBC
@TimesofIsrael and in the eyes of Obama. He hates gods people.
Israel is steeling land from palatine Would we just let Canada take Washington state or just Seattle from us
Let's not forget that many Palestinian children died.
yeah, UN has a pesky tendency to respect norms of international law, sovereignty, and human rights like that.
@TimesofIsrael Sen Graham, you finally said something intelligent! The election is over. You need to support Pres Donald.
Trump $ ties to Russia go back years! UK intel says Russia in contact w Trump during campaign! Impeach! USA bfre party!
Israel is our friend!
@TimesofIsrael Why cant you allow one simple criticism of someone you regard as a friend? Reagan, Bush, both let these pass
Those UN idiots need to the Bible Israel are Gods chosen people and God gave a lot more land than they have now Close UN
@TimesofIsrael maybe it's complicated?
@TimesofIsrael that's what happens when they use Nazi tactics on Palestinian people..so uh yeah...bad guys
@SenJohnMcCain @TimesofIsrael @realDonaldTrump can we get repeal of 17th amendment?
so just defund UN and close bldg you dork. all talk but do nothing except stir up divisive controversy @TimesofIsrael
Thank you Senator for your steadfast support for Israel. Bravo on pushing legislation to defund UN.
@TimesofIsrael Nah! Moral high ground is disappearing for the Jews! If settlement continues no two state solution possible
@TimesofIsrael they will move to China  we dont own the UN
settlements UN & Pals speak of not tiny, 40,000 residents & 100s of stores. all segregated! Graham, segregation is wrong!
really?
Even so, sometimes Israel really *is* the bad guy. U have 2 look case by case.
@TimesofIsrael Israel has no respect for our government or our people until they need something!
and you are always their puppet.
Why haven't you raised issue with Obama's interfering with Israel's elections?!!
@TimesofIsrael u afraid from israel  to inclose some thing https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=He3qUvDfud0 …
@TimesofIsrael
@TimesofIsrael
@TimesofIsrael
@TimesofIsrael graham imag u r phalastenian than u see land stolen by jewish from all ward.. come and try
@TimesofIsrael That's because they keep taking land.  Look at a 1950 map of Israel vs today.  They are the bad guy
@TimesofIsrael https://vimeo.com/187395992 
True. And you support meddling in Israel election? We did much worse than Russia. Blatant. Direct. Disrespectful. U said 0.
so you condone the settlements?
@TimesofIsrael
-Hey, "Sweetie"...your "Boyfriend"- John McCain..covered up Israel attack on USS  Liberty- !  "War Hero"? HA...
@TimesofIsrael then why did US give them $38billion?
@TimesofIsrael what about their non-democratic govt illegal land seizures and brutality
My daughter is ACA member she's 14 if it goes I have e only one choice planned Parenthood it's a clinic I can take her to for physicals
Ashamed snide remark made in Congress that Pres elect better take Russians seriously as if he is child. He has brains U?
Senator I would caution this issue is too complex to litigate on twitter
Regardless of the never ending pulverising of Gaza, killings of civilians, Palestinians always bad guys in the eyes of USA.
Maybe because they really are.
@TimesofIsrael well if they just weren't breaking the law.
defund UN
Never trust a man with a woman's name.
I know some really bad guys
https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=AKgW_4lSbVE …
@TimesofIsrael Appreciate your always standing with Israel. I too stand with Israel.
Israel has all rights within the boundaries established at the birth of Israel after WWII. That's it.
Israel is on the front lines in war against terror
Perhaps if you could bring your ass to real/current issues, you can find your lost trust.
there is a reason trump& Netanyahu see eye to eye. Both are devious and vile.
very true. A pair made in Hell
As a fiscal conservative shouldn't you cut Israel off so they'll be self sufficient instead of relying on hand outs?
@TimesofIsrael fake news liar
@TimesofIsrael 
many Israelis agree with the UN resolution. Palestians are being given the equivalent of
infected blankets.
Who are the real bad guys then;? Do they wear white sheets pulled over them ,hiding the identity?
Also tired of #Netanyahu talking to the American people as if we work for him and had better do what he says.
Only when they do bad things. Tired of this across the board "We love Israel" so ignore the bad stuff. It's bull. Sir.
@TimesofIsrael House vote tonight is encouraging. #StandWithIsrael message is loud and clear.
@TimesofIsrael stick to the People'sagenda. Jobs tax regulation
Many estimate 1000 C.I.A. assets were executed by the former S.Union cus of Israhell's spy Johnathan Pollard.
Thank you for your stand against the antisemitism of the UN.
what about the massacre and annihilation of Palestine? Don't they deserve to live?
Which is why we need to support Israel. The PLO in government with terrorist Hamas kills many Palestinians.
seems like you're buying a little too much into the crap Netanyahu says.
@TimesofIsrael @tempteststorm2 I'm pleased to see ur doing something besides supporting the delegitimizing of PE Trump
Well, there is that whole "breaking international law" thing they do again, and again, and again...
@TimesofIsrael w
@TimesofIsrael Way to generalize an incredibly complex situation!
umm..WHAT?
smartest thing you have said in two years
So are they never bad ever? Never ever?
Two wrongs don't make a right!
