The subject should be how do we keep from being #Recalled in two months?
The VP & tRUMP will be Indicted. Needs Work? Maybe Pull the Bill?



@LindseyGrahamSC You mean ROB hard working Americans to make the Top 1% richer? Rob US of $, health, and LIFE! Not #MAGA
Shame on you, Lindsey Graham.   Do you really want taking away healthcare from millions of people to be your legacy?
Let's ruin millions of lives, bankrupt and kill people, but in a civilized fashion civilized of course, over lunch. *maniacal laugh*
And feel free to get the lobster, the Koch brothers are paying.

Lindsey you are going to hurt people with this bill. Everyone will have a preexisting condition at some point. Patients in SC will suffer.
GrahamCassidy plan will price Rates out of the reach of most Americans. Pre existing conditions unaffordable. Millions of Americans will die
When u shove a healthcare bill through that takes 30 million off healthcare & doesn't add anything on FYI THAT ISNT HEALTHCARE!
@LindseyGrahamSC & Pence > when Pence goes down will Lindsay follow?
GOP "Wealthcare Bill" is death sentence to millions of Americans. Medicare For All is the logical choice, if you must sabotage aca 4 donald.

No conserv who cheers ripping away the insurance for babies born with critical diseases (for tax cuts) can EVER claim to be pro-life again.
VOTE NO.  You LIAR

Under this bill, pregnancy will cost you an extra 17K. Metastatic cancer 172K. Autism 5K. Asthma 4K. This isn't a healthcare bill.
Correction: where denying health care will be the topic.

A bill -- finalized yesterday, has not been scored, amendments not allowed, and 3 hours final debate -- should be viewed with caution.
No. Fake news! They don't talk about healthCARE, they only talk about robbing children of their healthcare. No idea how they sleep at night
Instead of trying to kill sick Americans, why don't you focus on Russia's attack on us?
@LindseyGrahamSC your medical coverage is the same as ours right? You'll be suffering the same as the people who voted for you?
Arrive w/ Russian crony.

A bill -- finalized yesterday, has not been scored, amendments not allowed, and 3 hours final debate -- should be viewed with caution.
You should be embarrassed Lindsay for even considering this healthcare bill Donald Trump must've spank your ass for you to want this to pass
wHERE THEY can vote to KILL children.
#murderers
@LindseyGrahamSC one lies, the other swears.
@LindseyGrahamSC You all should be ashamed of yourselves. Lucky4 you,Karma never misses her payments. I hope this is worth it.

If you too are disappointed in Sen @BillCassidy #GrahamCassidy let them know it - call (202) 224-3121 
Shame on you both. You only care about $$, not Americans. A pox on both your houses.
Every time I think maybe you're not so bad, you remind me that yes, you are.  Prayers for the poor, favors for the rich. That's who you are.
You people are monsters! At this point l'd vote for Satan just as long as he promised a painful end for your party.
Your bill will slash Medicaid funding, and will directly HURT my special needs daughter.  Shame on you.
You mean sentencing tens of millions of Americans to suffering and death.
Wherein they give up all government benefits including their own healthcare.
Says the white christian males who prefers to put money in his own pocket rather than help the needy, enjoy your time in Hades says Jesus!
You mean death care.
Nauseating. Ramming this through not because it's the best for the people but for a win and to block other possible proposals. SHAME
Graham and Pence are liars and cheats, just like the POTUS. We don't want repeal and replace. We want the ACA fixed, not annihilated!!!
Well, aint that sweet - closet buddies.
Single payer not civil war

Graham bragged about taking money from "big blue states" CA & NY: makes GOP House sticking it to their constituents for "party" very salient
@LindseyGrahamSC Cheating. Liars. Scum. Take from poor give to http://rich.you  are no Christian.
lindsey graham   IF U TAKE AWAY 20 MILLION PEOPLE'S HEALTHCARE

I HOPE THEY ALL COME LOOKING FOR YOU
Stop trying to give the wealthy a tax cut on the backs of our healthcare!!!!!

Shame on you Sen. Graham. You know better. Blood on your hands if it passes.

Lindsey the Liar

#healthinsurance industry whines @ how its teetering on the verge of collapse,& needs billions in subsidies. right!
Have you taken Russian money?  We know you've taken a bundle from the insurance companies.  How does it feel selling yourself?
Everything that comes out of your mouth is a lie, Graham, you're just as bad as that trash in the White House.
You all see health care as a commodity and are fine with it being a winner take all deal. Demonic.

Shame on you Lindsey Graham, actually thought you cared about Americans, not just rich Republicans. #ditchtheGOP
You get a lot of money from the medical industry.  Perhaps you should be more worried about corruption than single payer healthcare.
The bill is a joke
Senator Graham, our country is divided like never before. But EVERYBODY hates your POS bill. Unity!
The very first segment of the #GrahamCassidyTrumpDeathCare bill should remove all federal care for MoC, staff, all federal employees.
Socialism: taking money from CA & NY to pay for healthcare in other states and calling that returning to state run healthcare. @SenateGOP
Sniveling cowards!
32 million MORE uninsured, gutting medicaid, allows premium hikes for preexisting conditions and lifetime caps.  Is THAT being discussed?
Pass the bill!

Boy, you Senators must be in great shape just going up/down all those stairs. State Governors  change q 4 yrs. Have ins/don't have. Scary.
Sorry I missed lunch. Dividing our gov into either capitalism or socialism is totally backwards. Not even a family unit operates this way.
#Graham is an officer, but is no gentleman. @LindseyGrahamSC doesn't care how veterans or POWs are denigrated or denied care.#iserved #USAF
Graham: Let's take health care away from the people!  Pence: Yes. We'll say Jesus approves.
@SenateMajLdr and @GOP only care about donor money and party politics, not constituents. We now have taxation without representation.
Any bill not debated or scored needs to be viewed with suspicion... Sound familiar? I guess unless it's yours.
Please repeal and replace.  For every 1 person ACA helps it hurts 2 or 3 others.  Keep your promises to repeal and replace. #maga #Trump2020
How many more people will get affordable healthcare coverage than have it now? How many MORE?

JUST OUT: Here's a summary of the Graham-Cassidy repeal. Yes, it's that bad.

Spread far and wide if useful. 
Oh, and I bet y'all will pray while you send poor people off a cliff. Shut up about block grants. YOU FOOL NO ONE AT ALL. Christians? Bull.
Meaning Senator Graham and the GOP senators and reps. Hypocrites, greedy, self-serving one and all. This bill is the same old travesty.
Stop this disaster.
The disaster is obomacare aka ACA.  Repeal and replace as you promised the voters.
Watch the VIDEO. Find out what is really in the bill. On @MSNBC with @JRubinBlogger
Mass murderers
Obomacare kills as many as it helps.  You never see the other side.  The people who are healthcare poor because of premiums and deductibles.
Did not work in Indiana contrary to what @VP claims. Disaster!
...we are paying the price in more ways than one
WHAT DOES YOUR PLAN LOOK LIKE? The one that WE THE US. CITIZENS PAY FOR
HUH? Lazy & greedy
I want social healthcare! At least it would be more than I have now---NOTHING! What is VA? Which Lindsey has.
Let me fix that for you: "We need to bankrupt or bury millions of Americans ASAP. BTW, I'm pro-life."
"FEDERALISM"  is a synonim of BACK TO STATUS QUO before ACA, w/ NONE of benefits of ACA! YOU CONNING US,just like @POTUS did!COWARD ACT!
When U knew U had to do this, YOU DID NOTHING & U took a mo.+ vacation ...
Yur remarks are political bs.... Federalist redundancy...50 states reinventing the wheel vs one system... Pass universal health Care for all
How can you say sending healthcare to the states! No coverage mental illness,pre-existing conditions, pregnancy & more. Be ashamed!
Take your crappy healthcare bill and shove it. You're EVIL trying to do this again  #loser 
DO NO HARM
Fix the ACA. Save Medicaid. 
Your argument that Washington shouldn't legislate for states?
Okay. You're in DC. Stop legislating. 12%approval
Let's also recall that McConnell has broken many federal laws. Determined to steal healthcare from Kentucky so Kochs can play Scrooge McDuck
Remember when y'all handcuffed ppl in wheelchairs?
EVERYONE remembers.
Everyone does remember and will in 2018. You have not served Us well with this catastrophe. People matter!!!
NEW:Let's be clear. These are hardball tactics.

Republicans say repeal or nothing. People be damned.

http://politi.co/2hfxWLz  via @politico
Trump won on repeal and replace, that says more people are hurt on ACA then are helped.
You sir, are a liar.
Disgusting to take healthcare away to give billionaires YUGE tax breaks
Sounds to me like you are just passing the buck to the states. DO YOUR JOB. Stop complaining about time. U managed to take a month+ off...
It is not about health care it is about racists undoing Obamacare. Nothing less.
How do you lie with a straight face and sleep at night. #RepealAndReplaceRepublicans
ONLY reason ACA "FAILING" is because of OBSTRUCTION&SABOTAGE of @SenateGOP & @HouseGOP! Only 17% will SUPPORT YOU ALL in 2018! SHAME!
If they do not repeal and replace they will not get voted back in.  They promised repeal and replace. We voted for repeal and replace.
Graham,Pence Neither one of you may claim to be Christian anymore. Hurting most vulnerable is supposed to go against His teachings
Keeping ACA also hurts vulnerable people. 1,400 per mo premium, 9,000 deductible. I am having serious health concerns & can't afford Dr apt
I hear you. My understanding is it will be worse under this plan. &without full CBO score? Last min,take it or leave it plan. Unacceptable

#GreatReads: The staggering hypocrisy of Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham: http://bit.ly/2xkjGXg  @mattyglesias 
Translation: ...where ensuring for profit of insurance companies and profit over people will be the topic of discussion. 

#healthcare
Thing is all the uncertainty has already driven up costs. Insurance companies have to set up their 2018 pricing NOW. Already #tooLATE
Too bad you don't choke on it, compromised?
More likely they will be discussing the Koch brothers....
@LindseyGrahamSC back room deals to screw the American people.
Koch brother's say no more money unless Republicans take away people's health care and give tax cuts to the wealthy.
It should stay closed!
What's for dessert, oh cancer treatment, pre existing conditions..u know,the norm!#healthcare #HealthForAll #healthcarebill @GOP IS EVIL!

Oh, #WeReadIt. Section 106 allows states to waive underwriting req's. Insurers could charge through the roof for preexisting conditions.
