State block grants are how Establishment governors and senators pay kickbacks to their crooks and criminals! See TN as prime example.

Things are getting real bad for that so called president so let's go after HRC and Comey says Lindsey.

We're keeing him.
You get your news from Breitbart?
I love SC, my home, but Graham is about the bottom line, like the rest of them.
Breitbart 
#FakeNews
As Gov. Walker said, people do not want their healthcare decisions made for them in #DC.It's time to get Congress behind a sensible plan.
This should be on the state level. Controlling your own life is very American. Govt control is unAmerican.
Oh good you'll be getting a bill for all of my families healthcare.
#GOP Saboteurs hard at work!
If Walker is behind it watch your back POC, he is gonna screw us all.
And the Clinton foundation took hundreds of millions from far worse!
How come to get what you all want you treat us like we're stupid? How come when a constituent writes their Sentator they get political BS?
Take 'em all out Bob!.. Legal experts say Mueller just nailed Pence on impeachable crimes http://www.palmerreport.com/politics/mike-pence-mueller-impeach/4671/ … via @PalmerReport
"IT appears" You made your statement to deflect from Comey/Trump letter. FAILED. Pick your cherry tree. Traitor.
Fix it; don't care what you call it. It fix what's broken not what works. Be Americans first, GOP second.
Brietbart? Really? Why not just pronounce that you're racist and spread lying propaganda bs? Also, no on your crappy hc idea. #ImpeachTrump

 The Corrupt Republican Party 

@McConnellPress @marcorubio @ScottWalker @LindseyGrahamSC  @JohnKasich 

…
Good. Keep wasting time on settled law and avoid passing Trumps hate agenda #DefendDACA #Obamacare @ScottFarmerSC @ScottWalker
Let's see, senators wanting the money in THEIR states so their Establishment buddies can control who gets it. Recipe for pay-offs
In the article it is claimed Government Healthcare does not work, so how come all of the countries that do just that outperform us?
Scott Walker is one of the worst politicians ever elected to office!
Both #traitors with hundreds of millions of rubles amongst them. Vile power hungry scums!
These are the death panels the GOP warned us about in 2009.
@ChuckGrassley #GOP making us a Banana Republic!
Brietbart ... of course you hack!
You're not fit to clean Jim Comey's shoes. He has integrity something you will never have.
You're a fraud and Trump enabler. We see you.
You got sane for a while there and now you are un-sane again.
I'm not surprised that the Senator from South Carolina reads white supremacist websites.
Why is Lindsey RTing a Breitbart story? It's the platform for the alt-right. Bannon is there. What's wrong with you? Every last repub sucks
what's in it for you? You keep being strong-armed by trump, you'll eventually pay. @GOP will all pay a price anyway
Breitbart...nuff said.
Scott Walker is the WORST governor in America.  Talk to @JohnKasich about healthcare please.
Kasich is going to end up running w/a Dem on a unity ticket and clean your clock if the GOP doesn't get it together.
Listen to @JohnKasich about his plan.  That one will work.
@GOP
Why are you retweeting Breitbart?
What is wrong with you???  Defend our country and do not keep carrying water for this corrupt POTUS!
How is he "carrying water for POTUS?" By pushing forward conservative legislation to help America, which he was elected to do?
It's a dog, dead on arrival.
If Scott Walker likes it it must be horrible #MedicareForAll is the way to go
Damn @LindseyGrahamSC I never thought you would've taken Russian money. Disappointed
BREITBART!?  Really!?  That alone costs your twitter account its credibility. #traitor
It is a sad damn day when Lindsey Graham is RT'ing Breitbart.
Good healthcare that is affordable and accessible for everyone?  If not, it's not good enough.
Not giving breitbart a click, man
Lindsay graham is another GOP without scruples.  He needs to go.
Not gonna happen!
If this plan doesn't give us better coverage/lower ded./ lower premiums, then it is not better. Compitition across state lines needed.
Senator Graham has done a wonderful job with this bill. Republicans and Democrats need to support it.
Honestly what is wrong with you that you would repeal healthcare in the wake of a natural disaster
I don't trust anything Walker says
-ah guys, news flash, more Americans want Ocare than not..sometimes gotta let go
Congress, Senate & govt employees should be on the same insurance you force on us.
Another POS trying to harm our poorest, seniors and sickest ppl. Walker's day of judgement will come at next election and from above also.
Eliminate price gauging during health emergencies. Time for single payer.
No not single payer single payer is horrible give it back to the states
gentlemen...get ready for a fight
Did you really retweet your subordinate praising you? Taking lessons from Donnie?
These @GOP idiots are gonna give #RepealAndReplace another go! Just when you think no one could be more obtuse than @realDonaldTrump... 
So, no competition across State lines?
Ok come on Mr. Graham help Trump get this done. Get rid of Obama care. Pulling for GOP to get it together and make this happen.

It's a winner for white men, you mean. The rest of America? No. And, JUST TO BE CLEAR, it is not 1861 and it never will be again.
Was there bipartisan participation in developing this bill?

Veterans are speaking out against the Senate #Trumpcare bill which might hurt 1.75 million #veterans and their families #ProtectOurCare 
So you have to move to a different state with better coversge or cheaper?
Gosh.  Senior advisor to @LindseyGrahamSC ...going to guess he tells Graham exactly what Graham wants to hear.
I believe that it is our responsibility to first repeal Obamacare and then go from there with our decision making.
