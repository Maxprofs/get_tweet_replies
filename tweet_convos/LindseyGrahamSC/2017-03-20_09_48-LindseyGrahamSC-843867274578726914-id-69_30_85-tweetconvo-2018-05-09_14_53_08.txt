@LindseyGrahamSC It didn't bother the Republicans to sit on President Obama's nominee for 10 months. Now they want to play nice.
@LindseyGrahamSC it's already been compromised when they blocked an open seat
@LindseyGrahamSC he conveniently says after Merrick Garland is out of the way.
@LindseyGrahamSC yet that's EXACTLY what he did to Merrick Garland.
no response?  Yeah, tough to argue with 'facts'.
They should've thought of that last year I guess.....
@LindseyGrahamSC must get chaffed from riding the fence between supporting his party and what's the right thing to do.
Merrick Garland
loved to hear this last year, what did he say about blocking of Obama's nominee?
@LindseyGrahamSC he's right. But quite convenient timing on that.
The same way he supported an end to partisan warfare over Merrick Garland? Hypocrite.
oh NOW he wants to end partisan warfare over the judiciary. How convenient.
@LindseyGrahamSC yet it was republicans who blocked Obama's nomination for a full year.
@LindseyGrahamSC Might mean something if he'd said it a year ago. Now just partisan rhetoric.
@LindseyGrahamSC I think #gorsuch is qualified but talk abt partisan warfare is convenient to have now w/ a R pick. #garlandsseat
@LindseyGrahamSC confirming a "conservative" nominee IS destroying the judiciary. It should be about the law, not ideology.
what a remarkable change of heart @LindseyGrahamSC has had over the last year! @alykatzz
Lndsey where were you six month ago.
@LindseyGrahamSC I like how you want to call an end to it when u vehemently denied and stole Obama's pick.
@LindseyGrahamSC Sure he calls for bipartisanship now.  What happened last year.  Speaking out of both sides of his mouth.
@LindseyGrahamSC Does that mean Graham will vote no on Gorsuch until Obama's nominee is given a fair hearing?
@LindseyGrahamSC This is rich.
@LindseyGrahamSC where did he stand on refusing to vote on Obama's nomination, during Obama's presidency? Not so worried then.
The most nasty partisan warfare on all things, at all times, incl SCOTUS, has come from #GOP.#GorsuchHearing #smh
@LindseyGrahamSC ummm Garland?
@LindseyGrahamSC GOP is a bunch of children & we need adults to help us get our nominee approved. It will happen but not quickly
@LindseyGrahamSC Good way to end it would be to insist on having hearings on Merrick Garland.
If he believes it so strongly he shd have ended it himself last year by giving Garland a hearing. Never forget!
So Garland first, then Gorsuch?
@LindseyGrahamSC where was Graham when Pres Obama put SC justice nominee that pubs REFUSED to meet. Now want bi-partisan...wow
@LindseyGrahamSC better yet how about a judiciary that goes by the law and Constitution? Reason Lady Justice is blind.
@LindseyGrahamSC He didn't think that way last year...oh right, they got their way so now let's do what's right...
you should have thought of that when you went along with the Garland block....#shameless
@LindseyGrahamSC now that his party's nominee is up for consideration? Shocking.
So it's OK when you guys do it, but not when Dems do it? Fuck that.
@LindseyGrahamSC hasn't that already happened?
@LindseyGrahamSC 
Then he should push a new vote for Garland first. Resounding NO to GORSUCH #SCOTUS. We need impartial Justice.
Gee I wonder why  @LindseyGrahamSC didn't think of this when Garland was nominated by a legitimate President?
@LindseyGrahamSC then confirm Merritt garland then bec POTUS 44 did have d right to nominate him 4 SCOTUS
if
@LindseyGrahamSC Its a little late now. Both parties have tried to drive their agendas through judicial appt for a long time
@LindseyGrahamSC so now he's calling for trump to nominate Garland for #SCOTUS awesome!!!
Democrats used to mock Lindsey Graham. Now he seems like the voice of reason. I don't expect any apologies will be issued.
"Two wrongs don't make a right" says the person who did the wrong.
Interesting how NOW we need to be bi-partisan. Well, I agree, Let's give Merirrick Garland a hearing!
i like the west wing solution. Appt both garland and gorsuch
Yet not having a hearing on Merrick Garland was perfectly okay. Sen. Graham's hypocrisy is staggering
@LindseyGrahamSC all politicians are two faced. Dems and repubs.
Excuse me Senator Graham, but does the name Merrick Garland mean anything to you?
@LindseyGrahamSC funny he's calling for this when its his team nominating a judge.
@LindseyGrahamSC where were U when you & your party played politics at its best with Obama's nominee. Convenient to stop it now?
@LindseyGrahamSC kinda late
@LindseyGrahamSC Then they should have let the vote for Garland happen.
@LindseyGrahamSC then why wouldn't you convince @SenateMajLdr to hold a hearing on #Garland? You are better than this sir. You are
Sweet, so Garland first? @alykatzz @LindseyGrahamSC
@LindseyGrahamSC course he says that when it's his party's nomination up to bat. Where was he when Garland was nominated? Partisan
@LindseyGrahamSC oh NOW he says this. Of course.
Could you guys have done this last year?
That's why he insisted on hearings for Judge Garland.
