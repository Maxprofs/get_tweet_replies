I don't agree with your political views but I see you as a loyal true friend to John McCain.  You are a class act in my book

no he can't! he ponders over the situation and places himself the mist in the eye of the matter ..
It's sweet (despite this disastrous plan) that @LindseyGrahamSC gets chocked up about his BF @SenJohnMcCain 
No he hasn't. His is a liar.  John "Benedict" Mcain made a promise to his voters and cannot damn vote the way he wants
and so your bill fails.. learn to have a backbone
Hate this bill, but respect you & your support of, devotion 2 friendship with John McCain. I wish him quick, full healing & u both long life
I don't mind that he voted against the bill.The bad part is that he relentlessly campaigned against Obamacare & when it came time he flipped
Thank U, Sen. Graham, for acknowledging that this patriot/hero has the freedom to do what he thinks is good for Americans! #ImpeachTrumpNow
This is much bigger than @SenJohnMcCain His vote will not affect him, but all it will affect us.  His vote should be for OUR healthcare!
Why do you make business of our health?
Becausevme and my 50,000 $ salary cant afford my BO insurance..let alone yours
That's the reason we need free Heath care and government should take responsibility for security, health and education. I paid tax for what?
You are a traitor to the American people! You can go down with Trump! Impeach!
@LindseyGrahamSC MY FATHER WAS A RETIRED AIR FORCE PILOT WITH FOUR COMBAT TOURS OF DUTY. MCCAIN IS A TRAITOR LIKE YOU.
If Senator Graham is such good friends with John McCain as news media purports them to be, why does he vote totally opposite?
@LindseyGrahamSC watch for lightening strikes at church this morning. #GodIsWatchingU
Thank you for that response to Trumps horrible attacks on Senator McCain, very well said :)
Agree
Mccain is a lying scumbag liberal. No he doesn't get a pass on lying about repeal and replace. Can't wait till he is gone
FYI: @SenJohnMcCain actually understands this purposed plan & can actually articulate why he opposes UNLIKE POS @POTUS who has NO clue
Good for you senator graham, still not a fan but respect you a lot after saying that.
I don't agree with Graham-Cassidy. But your friendship with Senator McCain is terrific to see.  Kudos.  #GrahamMcCainFriendship
Thank you for standing up for an American hero and showing #potus what makes America great.
Can’t support the bill- but hve much support for u for standing up for @SenJohnMcCain & showing us Congress isn’t always “good ol boys”club.
Damn right. Grahams greed is showing. Trying to rob millions of Americans in order to keep rich powerful donors happy.
How does it feel to side w/ those calling for McCain to die?  How does it feel to sell your soul to Koch and Russia for political gain?
Sen. Graham also knows his effusive McCain praise is the savviest way to change @SenJohnMcCain mind.  He likes him but that was calculated
Graham you and your rat buddies need to be stripped of your healthcare rights......PERIOD

sorry....being a veteran doesn't entitle a person like mccain to lie to his voters
McCain has gotten his revenge on potus..time for him to retire.Graham knew he would vote no.he's fake, too
And we can vote him out if we damn well want to..hes turned democrat and that cancels out his loyalty to country
So you have no problem with him lying for years to his constituents?
Thank you for standing up for your colleague and friend. He's totally worth all your kind words!!'
Say it again. AMEN.
No. No-one can earn the right to break the law and support America's enemies.
He is supposed to work for the people....so No he can't do whatever the hell he wants.
Let Obamacare perish ...while insurance companies getting richer since Obamacare was implemented .thanks to @DNC for screwing our healthcare
Keep in mind, this happened because few read the original bill & it was a legacy passing for PO-nothing more.

Well you got one thing right u old fart. He's an American hero. I'm Democrat and hats off to John McCain. He saved my life twice now.
This man is a big two face hpyocrite and a big liar he is also a racism and gay and he love a TV camera
I have guess that sen mccain and sen graham are gays couple 
He's earned that right?!?!?didbnt he earn the right to fight for his constituents? Or did I miss the idea of representation?
He is right about that.
Damnit, something I agree on with Lindsay Graham.
That would be supporting war hero @SenJohnMcCain
Respect? He voted in 2015 on the same process he now denounce, knowing Obama will veto it. Just to get reelected in '16.  He's a deceiver.
He's supporting his friend and that I respect.  He didn't even address that McCain should represent his constituency not himself.
FTR, I never said respect.  McCain is a war hero but he's a representative of the people of Arizona.
I can't wait til John Mcstain is repealed and replaced.
@LindseyGrahamSC was alot cooler before his gender reassignment surgery. Used to suck us off for 12 bucks!!
What? How does one have to earn a right? Is it a credit of right that we have? And we have to pay that off first?
He lied, and would not have been elected if he had been honest. AZ should recall him. You don't earn the right to deceive constituents.
Truth
We the people also can do whatever we want! Screw your BS kill Americans HC, hateful potus. Help Puerto Rico! Hell No on your tax cuts
1/2 Runaway climate change, ISIL, nuclear DPRK, the worst racial divisions since the 1970's. It's a shame we can't erase Obama from history.
2/2 It'll be a long time before anyone's able to do any worse though.
When crazy Christians try to curse to be cool
No he hasn't
Who are you pleasing?? Trump?? Koch Bro.$$$ Fix ACA without Repeal leaving millions w\o healthcare. Bipartisan solution for ONCE PLEASE!
“Why not say--as some slanderously claim that we say--"Let us do evil that good may result"? Their condemnation is just!”
And CNN doesn't like it !!!!
No he can't do whatever he wants, he must do what the VOTERS who put in office want
Conman @realDonaldTrump WATCH AND LEARN! @SenJohnMcCain has the right to vote as he wish!
McCain and u can lick each other’s ass. He ran on repeal and replace  and we deserve the truth not the swamp
He's a true hero.

That’s the smartest thing he has said in weeks!
#GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
This is Colleen of ADAPT.

I have no idea what this country is supposed to be 
I think LG literally loves JM. But way to stick up for your boy
respect and best wishes for Sen McCain
I LOVE HOW LINDSAY GRAHAM LOVES JOHN MCCAIN!! I WISH HE FELT & SHOWED THAT LOVE TO THE AMERICAN PPL! HIS BILL DOESNT REPRESENT LOVE
Your wrong Sen.Graham,this is bigger than any one person.The only thing any of you so called politician should do is the right thing,no pass
Nice words. Now McCain can criticize everyone's ideas and showboat no. Let's see McCain get off his dead ass and put a fix out there
No he hasn’t!
#HealthCareDebate love your views on Sen McCain please before we decide on anymore bills please Replace and Reappeal @realDonaldTrump .
#FakeNews #propaganda #ImpeachTrump #realnews #justGOPRACIST THATS ALL!!
You got the people's vote, so you should damn well vote in their interest, not your personal interest.
I think Trump won't agree with that
.@LindseyGrahamSC  AGREE and YOUR #GrahamCassidy BILL STILL SUCKS
No he didn't.   He was elected to do a job. Obviously that doesn't matter to career politicians.
Some psychophants feels he's free to say anything he likes be cause he doesn't kiss assses lol
THIS is the clip you decide to cover?  What is this joke news coverage?  Get some balls @CNN!  People will die if this is passed!  smdh
@LindseyGrahamSC thank you for showing @SenJohnMcCain the respect he has earned. I hope if needed you will set @POTUS straight also.
Respect? He voted in 2015 on the same process he now denounce. Just to get reelected in '16.  He's a deceiver.
Worst kind of a politician.
@LindseyGrahamSC not because he earned the right but he does what he believes is the right thing to do.
Yes simply hating potus because he lost
@LindseyGrahamSC is a dope who thinks health care for all is "socialized medicine." The brain dead @GOP zombies need mental health care.
Tell 'em Sen Lindsey Graham. Whoever says McCain is not a hero, is a nut!
Respect? He voted in 2015 on the same process he now denounce, knowing Obama will veto it. Just to get reelected in '16.  He's a deceiver.
Graham, you are an imbisill and you have no interest in protecting the people or their healthcare. Cap cost of health. Single payer. Do that
CNN how about an hour to Puerto Rico
Says CNN #Fakenews
The only truthful thing @LindseyGrahamSC has said tonight
Awfully white of you to say so! NICE - awfully NICE of you to say so, I mean. 

#TheResistance
At least Lindsey has little bit of human decency left, too bad it's only directed at his friend and doesn't apply to rest of US
No he has to do what ever we the people damn well want. I guess its going to take the next election for these swamp rats for that to sink in
John McCain is the Baghdadi Man. The creator of ISIS!
And there my fellows Americans is why the government is virtually useless. #DoYourJob
It's a shame that Lindsey Graham is owned by the Koch Brothers.  It's why he has to do this.
More @amyklobuchar sound bites please. She's amazing tonight!
No she's not. She praised states crafting policies but against giving them power. Praised her state fix but against it Federally. #emptysuit
@jennnnyfox
graham not true. Many Ins Plans used to commonly not cover Pregnancy. And they would hide it from you until you were surprised at Hosp.
He's the poster child for term limits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLkD7V07f_E …
He "earned" that right? R U freaking Efing me??? Why? Cuz thr RINOS? McCain, Ryan, McConnell, Graham and the rest of the rinos need 2 go!
My favorite Republican. He just fu--ing gets it!
That was sweet. I forgot Republicans can be normal humans with hearts sometimes, where'd those types run off to?
It was sweet but I can't ignore this awful #GrahamCassidy bill...
We can have both thoughts. Lindsey Graham is not a piece of trash, and he also wrote a healthcare bill that is.
That sounds better.
To someone who had invited an extremely bad karma there’s no nice words to describe him!
Lindsey Graham is so weak
@LindseyGrahamSC you are right that John McCain has earned the right to vote against your mean and heartless bill.
John McCain @SenJohnMcCain is a facade. Claims to caucus with Republicans - shows up on vote night as a Progressive. Switch party or resign.
Thank you for the compliment. I always love it when uneducated children reach out to me.
McCain changed because the republicans didn't come up with a good plan and follow normal order for passing such an important law.
Respect? He voted in 2015 on the same process he now denounce. Just to get reelected in '16.  He's a deceiver.
Worst kind of a politician.
AGREED

The good thing about this debate is that it's relatively civil. AND no big mouth, orange, mentally-deranged megalomaniac @realDonaldTrump!!!
I don't care what you or McCain want I care for REAL healthcare. Stop selling your BS and listen to the experience of sick people.
@LindseyGrahamSC but how dare the female senators disobey you, right?
I don't like Graham's desperate squeaky voice 
I think that is the smartest thing that has come out of your mouth
Amen, he's earned that right, the first political statement I can respect  #allheart
John McCain says everyone work together. Reps and Dems. He is a real American. Not a reality show ratings hound playing ratings games.
Respect? He voted in 2015 on the same process he now denounce, knowing Obama will veto it. Just to get reelected in '16.  He's a deceiver.
Did Lindsey Graham just identify as gender neutral?
He earned that right? Awesome! How do I earn the right to do whatever I want?
absolutely he can @John McCain. 
And here I thoughgt you we're part of the evil empire. Stand up to 45. Reach across the ailse. We will support you.
McCain won't be doing anything much longer
…getting elected based on a LIE is NOT acceptable. It’s fraudulent.
Just because @SenJohnMcCain had the right to betray those that voted and placed their trust in him, does not mean he should.
Actually it's not HIS right. There's no lifetime achievement award which entitles him to be rogue Republican. He represents the people of AZ
Lindsay, selling body parts!!!
JOHN McCain will die with REAL HONOR.... And I'm not Republican.
Maybe little Lindsey will resign after John passes
#lindseygraham is part of the swamp.  #DrainTheSwamp !!!
The guy that just shot up  church in Tennessee had #TakeTheKnee header on his facebook page Hes a Sudanese immigrant
Check out @Russian_trolls’s Tweet:
Behind the scenes in my troll farm. 
Some Republicans & all Democrats must like Obama Care.Time for Congress,staff & Federal employees to join Obamacare like the rest of America
Lover's quarrel. Those two have always voted together on everything.
Why?

Thumbs down on McCain. Hopefully he says adios to the senate sooner rather than later
Here are some of the anti-white and pro-Sharia Law Facebook posts from the Sudanese terrorist in Tennessee.
CNN will hide the fact that this was racially motivated. I'll bet money on it.
Don't tell @realDonaldTrump - he might cry
Sen. Puppet Lindsey Graham (one of the dumbest people in politics): Mental Basketcase John McCain... Full Statement:
Sickmof these fake posts..they should be illegal
