@thehill defund and kick out of the USA.
AND AMERICANS WILL PUSH YOU BACK. WAIT FOR IT. TIME TO REMEMBER THE OTHER 255 MILLION AMERICANS
we will not be gentle nor stopped; all of your kingdoms will be toppled; there's nothing to stop it! Go buy it!
/\MU/\/-R/\ said the kingdoms of man may fall but who cares they are made for shabooz goy to inhabit until hit.
the Egyptian Sphinx is of Judah but there are more Sphinxes! You are all liars! Some were posed in parks. Lark.
either way it goes you all still lose; you have let Israel dominate regions never theirs as the story is sent.
@realDonaldTrump perhaps he never knew what was what then but the Dream told of how diplomacy would work on it.

Too bad you don't care as much about your constituents who will lose their healthcare.

@realDonaldTrump 
@RealSheriffJoe we work at locale levels demand our wages be paid on time where is my reward?
@thehill

the Benjamites have been destroyed by this group of Hyksos sheepherders hunters rule those forests vs. wolves.
the 13th tribe why of course the Bible said how wolves would consume the flocks. Parasites. You have explained.
the Lamb of God shall dwell within his temple as he sees fit; into prison he will never for you visit he hates.
the Lord Jesus Christ will no longer be denied his place upon this Earth as he dwelt among us as the Shepherd.
Ahmose @TGowdySC Ahmose I: 'Moses' law sucks.' Go drop those dreads. Thutmosis the II. I no understand. Deaded.

Nun an Egyptian God logic; you don't get it? That means Egypt; what is knot? Hell is hot. You have lied to all.

of course it was hate was put; Hat says you're full of ----. Sued are all of your armaments. Just ornaments.*/\
It's good to see you two working together.
@thehill
@thehill
the lion and the lamb know how to get along if not for a. hunters b. licenses c. dogs d. vipers e. poisons f. A
go --- off I was there when two top U.S. Senators Graham & McCain sat at the same table as the P.M. for Israel.
be the first to come arrest me as you bring Alex Jones persuasive; you still let that thing talk same bullshit.
we don't care about your migraine headaches with each other; you ---- should all die be buried together for it.
we are prepared to knock off every single one of you politicians who have helped us lose this battle vs. ISIS!!
what you have done for Israel has helped ISIS spread far and wide into Europe the United States Australia what?
you pathological liars has there been one single justice done that does not lead to more of the same harass us?
what you and @SenJohnMcCain did 'for' Israel; you pair of liars should be prepared to burn in hell as @TGowdySC said: bite.
you are both part of the same camp that works against white people; go drop dead: you're going to both be gone.
Thanks for taking action
#Defund 
@UN

#Israel 
#StandWithIsrael
I don't agree. You should be protecting US from #TraitorTrump & his master Putin.
@thehill And you were doing so well, Sen. Graham. You looked like you weren't part of Batshit Crazy machine.
@thehill Thank you for Supporting Israel
@thehill as we give up western world leadership.
@thehill thank you Senators!
THANK YOU FOR LEADING!
Two Traitors interfering with United States foreign policy
should hang #traitor
I don't agree! And how could you align yourself with that vile reptile with no morals aka @SenTedCruz. Don't shame SC!
You should've backed President Elect Trump when he said the same thing when he was still candidate Trump, BUT YOU DIDN'T!
@thehill Thank You both very much for standing up for Israel!! Thank You for this too!
This seems completely out of proportion to the "offense"-do you whack your head w/ a hammer to kill mosquito?
@thehill Shame on you Lindsey stop being arrogant
@thehill DON'T pay attention to the trolls. You're doing the right thing. Palestinians just don't want peace.
@thehill Thank you, thank you, thank you for #StandingWithIsrael
Dam right we agree. @seanhannity
@thehill I do NOT agree! They need their hands slapped!! Enough
So our tax $$ fund Israeli healthcare and abortion which is legal there. You are incredible hypocrites
How about focusing on the Russian president elect, who wants to become dictator. So frustrated with you.

Anyone advising for #UN dissolution should be made to live in a 3rd world country where #UN is essential for survival. #TheResistance 
@thehill what about the rights of the Palestinian people?  Seems like you are ignoring their rights.
I do NOT agree. I support Israelis & Palestinians. Strong-arming rest of world by defunding UN is indefensible.
Agree. Peaceful 2-state solution must be our goal, not Israelis at expense of Palestinians.
Agreed. Don't understand US's blind loyalty 2 Israel given history. Peace for all shld be goal.
Absolutely. That's one of many reasons I'm atheist. Killing in the name of a god is absurd.
Right on!
Obama Administration provided a large amt of funding to Israel this year. You're supporting human rights abuses
@thehill # Stop the nonsense....Do what the people asked you to do when you were elected...Limit your Term...
You're kissing up. Stop it.
NO I DO NOT AGREE
@thehill So you support Israel breaking its agreements? Expect more violations to come.  :(
@thehill good stuff Lindsey. Why don't u swallow hard and board the trump train. USA needs unity 
Why are you so determined to kill your constituents? Please keep your hands off our my healthcare! #SaveACA
@thehill been the policy since Carter to remain neutral or abstain on Israel and a good one at that, #chillout
@thehill OO encroaching into Palestinian land needs to stop or there will never be peace there stop pandering
@thehill Unlikely bedfellows!  Get rid of Netanyahu or wait until he goes.  He is the problem! Two states!
@thehill 76 RT
Senator, if the noose is around your neck, I'd suggest not jumping from the horse.
@thehill Please don't talk tough about Tillerson then back down and fail to vote against. He's not salvageable!
The devil makes you do that.
What a terrible idea. C'mon now guys.
What is the opposite of a RT? I'll do that.
2A the way they want then remind them what the fuck it really means?
@thehill Is this while Israel bombs Syria, builds settlements in Palestinian territory?
Nonsense. Stop supporting this criminal regime.
@thehill Why are you destabilizing world order? Do you think that's wise at this moment?
@thehill Just plain wrong.
@thehill Really? U think u may be overdoing it here in some effort to draw attention to yourselves? C'mon boys.
@thehill What happened to America first? Netanyahu can take care of himself.
@thehill Maybe Israel needs to play nice and maybe you should insist they do or you will be fanning the flames.
You are such a stooge of the Israel Lobby, it's painful to watch.....
Israel has been non-compliant, hostile, and quite deserving of the rebuke.
@thehill 

Do you two represent U.S. or @Israel
Our allies UK, France, Japan, Spain & New Zealand voted yes
@thehill 

Why do you let @Israel rip off #AmericanTaxPayers for $38 Billion in wefare payments
expanding Israel's borders in this underhanded way won't bring back (or bring for the first time) the messiah.
as much as I support Israel's right to exist, Bibi violates treaties by continuing to build settlements.
@thehill Far more meaningful to do something supportive of Israel...oh wait, haven't we done enough yet?
@thehill I do not agree with this
@thehill How about you get on the "Replace" part of "Repeal and Replace" first?
@thehill why do you need to fund the colonialism of the crazy settlers?
@thehill maybe you should think about USA you cowards
@thehill You are completely wrong on this
I wouldn't work on anything with that snake in the grass, Cruz!  Stay focused on Russia!
@thehill WorldPeace shouldn't just b pageant punchline,should b goal. Israel operated in opposition 2 that goal
@thehill Conflict?
@thehill Conflict?
@thehill Netanyahu has gotten a lot of help from US and I think Netanyahu has cheated the Palestines
@thehill please explain to me why we are favoring Israel? The Palestines need s place to live too!
dont agree at all; if/when you lose a vote, you dont threaten to take your ball and go home; review democracy
@thehill I do not agree!
You only got 46 retweets and 64 likes in 2 hours out of 110K followers. 
you gotta admit he trolled you pretty well there
@thehill by this nonsense action you undermine the US relation with Arab and Muslim countries.
@thehill Israel is a terrorist state that builds more settlements on Palestinian lands.
7 more days. #Inauguration2017
@thehill Totally disagree with you and your buddy, Ted.  You are so wrong!
@thehill disappointed in you Lindsey, expected stupidity from Cruz.
I guess only 32 retweets means that majority do not agree with you on this issue.
@thehill. You think Israel should push expansion? I guess God gave them the land. The time you believe in God
what they did should be looked at as a criminal act
@thehill nope. I don't agree. At all.
@thehill I do not agree. Two state policy has been us policy for 40 yrs. Netanyahu bully. I'm with @potus & @UN
@thehill We do NOT agree.
Hear hear!!
@thehill Certainly we can support Israel, and the UN. Pulling out of UN/NATO plays right into Putin/Trump hands
Let Israel and Palestine work on their own issues. Dont show them attention and they will stop crying.
@thehill his soul punish u live
@thehill
@thehill
@thehill his soul blam u in sleeping dream
.@LindseyGrahamSC As my senator, make sure you read this ENTIRE thread. Your staff and I will talk (again) tmrw.
.@LindseyGrahamSC @SenTedCruz What is it with Republicans doing stupid, shortsighted things to try to get their way?
@thehillWhat a waste of time. You should focus on PEOTUS conflicts of interest & Putin ties. Country over party
horrible idea
that will be the first thing DECENT you have ever done.
I am pro-Isreal but that doesn't mean their right to exist usurps anyone else's. 2/2
@thehill I'm confused. I had no idea Israel had a seat in the US Senate. Thought you represented South Carolina
@thehill They were sending a message. They may not build settlements against the will of the USA. It is correct
Actually they were talking a slap @ illegal settlements and Isreal's increasingly right-wing gov't. 1/
@thehill What are you doing? This is CRAZY!
@thehill Dude I hope your retweets are as low as  your campaign numbers.
@thehill Wrong!
@thehill "Taking a slap"? Can't you explain your difference of opinion without Trumptalk?
@thehill Any politician that sides with Cruz has lost my respect and their self respect as well
If Jesus comes back, he probably won't pick Israel, so relax. Focus on Comrade Trumpski and healthcare!
@thehill Punish us by striking back.  Stop hurting American People.  Already set death sentence for uninsured!
so instead of being wary of Russia, now u want 2 play in2 Putins hands..where have our American leaders gone
@thehill  a slap ?You both have ceded our sovereignty long ago /#1 recipient foreign aid & zero accountability
Pls explain what millions of people whose lives depend on @UNICEF  @WFP @WHO and other UN orgs have to do w/ your political temper tantrum.
thank you.  If the US doesn't support its allies and its values, then what is the USA?
@thehill yeah whatever why don't you find out about your illegitimate president first
@thehill does this mean you forfeit your seat on the security council
Thank you @LindseyGrahamSC and @tedcruz for your steadfast and unwavering support of our ally #Israel
So as long as UN caves to US and Israel 100% of the time you'll support it the UN, I get it.
DISAGREE. @thehill
@thehill 
NO.
You are WRONG. The settlements are disastrous for Israel.  This is just your endless Obama hate.
I am seriously appalled at your desire to take such an action  why did we bother to win WWII if not for this?
@thehill  Please make sure my kids lose their health coverage. Thank you, sir! 
DISAGREE.
No. Do not punish children and risk nuclear security over a single symbolic UN vote.
@thehill NO ONE AGREES
You're wrong. Millions of us agree w/ both Sen. Graham & Sen. Cruz. Cut the funds!
You can speak for millions? #bullshit
You just spoke for everyone. Short term memory? 7 more days. #Inauguration2017
No. I admire your willingness to stand up to Trump, not your condoning of Israeli human rights abuses.
@thehill can't believe you're teaming up with Ted Cruz.
@thehill screw israel.  Focus on not killing US.  Don't take our insurance!
With all respect, sir
#wakeup There will soon be a maniac in the White House
@thehill Disagree the settlements must stop.
@thehill Stop building on disputed lands!
is there anything Israel could do you wouldn't approve of?
You have no comprehension of the purpose of the UN and the work they have done. Disgusting sir - disgusting!
This is contrary to the reason the UN was created in the 1st place.  It was not created to be a US Rubber Stamp
@thehill we call that blackmail.
@thehill If you only cared as much about your constituents who are going to lose their healthcare!
why would the care about constituents? The constituents aren't who give them millions
Historian Niall Ferguson said that UN is essentially just an agency of US Gov't.US gives >25% of all UN funding
Be careful what you wish for. US holds up the Int'l order. It is not just about simple policy positions.
Does US have leverage? Sure.But does US want  UN system to collapse? Would serve Putin's attack on Int'l order.
Cruz will hurt your cause (whatever it is) because he's so unlikable.
 Why are you sentencing millions of Americans to medical debt and sickness ?! HISTORY WILL NOT BE KIND TO YOU.
Most people can't afford obamaf****** care let it be replaced, I don't have $400. a month do you?
PLUS A HUGE DEDUCTABLE!!!!!!
dude. You were like the last conservative left with scruples. Now you're taking it in the pooper from Cruz.
.@LindseyGrahamSC @SenTedCruz What is it with Republicans doing stupid, shortsighted things to try to get their way?
Debt ceiling brinksmanship, government shutdown, the sequester...
permanent filibuster, obstruction of supreme court nomination for nearly a year...
obstruction of nominees because you didn't like their agency, or to slow-walk perfectly good judges...
or to oppose a healthcare plan straight out of @Heritage just because it was Obama who proposed it...
or setting up half a dozen committees to investigate a consulate attack, more than Pearl Harbor, 9/11, etc...
withdrawing funds from a peace-keeping organization b/c independent countries said something mean to Israel...
Trump isn't the only one that benefited from Putin and they know it.
