Every death by Trumpcare will be publicized. This will be the fall of the Republican Party.
Your darn right it will be. But it's the way they don't care that gets me
Of course Ryan would do this... he has kissed Trump's ass simply to get HIS legislation signed by the orange crayola. No ethics. 2018 - Bye!
I've worked all my adult life and paid my taxes only to have a group of old men take away mine & my husbands HC when we need it the most?
Too bad we have to pay their wages. They sure don't work for the people. Things need to change
This bill has had no expert hearings, no input, and effects 1/6 of the US economy. Senator Graham, you should be ashamed of yourself.
Sure Flake is trying to save his ass
What a bunch of thugs and their base follows them blindly into the trap. #impeachTrumpnow
Their base is nothing more than stupid mice. Like the pied piper waiting for crumbs so they can grab them up.
You're so right!
No surprises here
KOCH CARE
And throws Americans under the bus
Greed and Evil run strong with these monsters. Shame on them all and the mothers who bore them!  Working for the Koch's NOT you!
Watch the VIDEO. Find out what is really in the bill. On @MSNBC with @JRubinBlogger

#ACASavesLives
#YouTryToKillUs
Repubs want more Americans to die. Without healthcare, in endless wars, in poverty, weak education systems, insane college debt. I can go on
Will be voted out of office. You are a horrible man after all
Shame on the GOP & their death plan. At least it won't be the successful plan designed by a black man though, right? Graham-Cassidy sucks.
Really? You’re a sell out too? Is there any Republican that cares about the people. Watch this video: https://www.facebook.com/jimmykimmel/videos/1977414852535607/ …
Passing a bill with out a CBO score is crazy it will hurt the people who vote for you

JUST OUT: Here's a summary of the Graham-Cassidy repeal. Yes, it's that bad.

Spread far and wide if useful. 
Your health care bill sucks. There is no way it compares to what we already have! Leave our health ins alone! You and every other republican
How shameful that you, Ryan and McConnell want to fleece Americans of health care to reward the very wealthy #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
Of course they support it it's a big tax break for the rich don't people realize that republicans are for the rich not middle class #Donors
Of course they do...these people have no heart or soul ruled by $
House leadership doesn't represent those who need them most. They represent the wealthy and you know it. #Repulsive
must.
yes.
Because they are all SPINELESS and care more about Party and Career than AMERICANS and their health. Lindsey Graham you are evil.

@LindseyGrahamSC
This happens to people with pre existing conditions. https://www.cbpp.org/blog/cassidy-grahams-waiver-authority-would-gut-protections-for-people-with-pre-existing-conditions … Thugs @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan #ImpeachTrump @BillCassidy
I'm a Dem who was coming to like you for the 1st time. Now you go & slop together a bill like this? We'll remind them in 2020. We remember.
@LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy How do you look at yourselves in the mirror? Have you no shame, dignity? Messing with people's lives this way
House GOP = Deathcare support to eliminate Americans.  Stand proud with traitor trump.
GOP leadership are liars and crooks.
How many other developed countries make poor sick people beg for politicians for their lives over and over?It is evil, cruel and wrong.
Stop trying to hurt us! What is f'kn wrong with you!??
Worst idea ever. If you want to do this stop going on TV as if you're some sort of moderate #evilrepublicans
Look at all the happy, overpaid white dudes. Man, please don't vote for these people in their next election. They need to feel our pain.
Greedy so and so!
Guess who is not behind the bill?
Patient groups come out in force to condemn new GOP bill to repeal ObamaCare http://hill.cm/5xruJ1b  

Patient groups come out in force to condemn new GOP bill to repeal ObamaCare http://hill.cm/5xruJ1b  
Evil SOBs.  Karma is going to get you.
A disgusting and evil plan to strip healthcare away from millions. Shame on the GOP. #GrahamCassidyKills

How Republicans Could End Up Being The Party That Solidifies Obamacare http://trib.al/X0To0wl  
They don't care how many people that will die without healthcare. Their hatred of Having the name Obama in healthcare is driving this.  Sad!

9. Graham & Cassidy are going around saying that under their bill, if a state likes Obamacare, it can keep it. That's a lie.
How could u propose something that would harm Americans? How about fixing the ACA instead of undermining it?
You may now stop calling yourself a man of God.

They won't stop until they've destroyed health care for millions.
They would support a pile of dog crap if they thought it would pass, oh, wait, they have.
Graham wants his legacy be 90 second debate over worst healthcare bill in history.  Horrible horrible people in charge of our lives.
#GOP - Of course these imbeciles did.  They are not leaders; they are scam artists.
I wish you people knew what it's like to constantly worry about wheather your preexisting condition will be covered.  #GrahamCassidy = shit.
Yes, they want another beer party in the WH garden.
There is no bill. Just repeal.
Cruel
@LindseyGrahamSC IT'S A BULLSHIT BILL Y'ALL SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF TRYING THIS AGAIN! FULL REPEAL AND GIVE UP YOUR KING CARE!
Easy to support when senate doesn't have votes to repeal currently. #DrainTheSwamp
Politics at its worst-bill stinks to high heaven & no one cares about the damage it will cause.  They claim a "win" & we all lose.
Why must you brutalize the poorest of people who need Medicaid like my autistic grandson or my elderly mother no other choice but Medicaid
Very disappointed in you, Sen Graham. Throwing so many people "under the bus".
@LindseyGrahamSC @SpeakerRyan And after supporting the crap bill House members will resign before being primaried.

Creep


Hey, do me a favor and let John Rutherford know I WILL NOT vote for him in 2018 if he votes for this bill. GOP dying..sad.
@LindseyGrahamSC #Withdraw_the_Bill
https://twitter.com/SenWhitehouse/status/909890752343416833 … It's a bad bill and those who vote for it are risking losing their seat in 2018.
Serious red flag if organizations that work to protect patients don't support a "health care" bill. #GrahamCassidy http://newsroom.heart.org/news/sixteen-patient-and-provider-groups-oppose-grahamcassidy-bill … 
too little too late
Conservatives should be for anything that gives power back to the states.
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan Sad for the poor, women, pre-ex patients, 20+ M Amer & Very sad for this great democracy! GOP Gov obstruction!
@HouseGOP Why not give Americans the same healthcare plans, options, rates members of Congress receive? We don't deserve what you get?
Shame on you! This a terrible bill.
Does it Kill More or Less than AHCA?
Enabling party - anything for the traitor! Party before people at all costs. #ImpeachTrump
This bills has block grants that would allow states like CA to use funds to give HC to undocumented people. #regularorder
#MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
I asked people to share what it's like to live in a country with universal health care. The responses that came in were incredible. 
Its still #Trumpcare with a new branding - A BIG FAT TAX CUT FOR 1%. 

#ProtectOurCare #ACA NO REPEAL.  VOTE NO #GrahamCassidyBill
Of course.
Get a life boys...
