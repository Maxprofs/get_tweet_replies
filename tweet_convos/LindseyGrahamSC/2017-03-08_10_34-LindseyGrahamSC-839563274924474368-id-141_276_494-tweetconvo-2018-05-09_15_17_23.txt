@braden_rose @CNN I hope I'm wrong but it seems like nothing will come of this
probably would've already happened by now.
@LindseyGrahamSC  Lindsey you're no longer one of my heroes. A visit to the Whitehouse is all it takes to buy you?
Hey @LindseyGrahamSC?? Wake up dude. FBI, CIA, Obama, all of them r corrupt. R u??? If not, then don't be conned
Really? Then what's this? 

#FISA obtained to investigate Trump weeks before election. Another Non-FISA warrant also obtained. Nothing found. https://www.youtube.com/embed/T3iBnXsQ21w â€¦
Obama caught red-handed tapping Merkel, France & other countries, what odds Obama tapped Trump
It's sad that goprs don't understand that the CIA and FBI work independent of the White House.

Really? Then what's this? 
And if it was done through an A.G 1: it was LEGAL and 2: that wouldn't be a FISA Warrant. FISA does not work
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN when is the Russian investigation starting?? Communist sympathizer I believe is the way to describe Lindsey
@LindseyGrahamSC   Please pursue vigorously before trump weakens our union further.
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN sick are u act like it's no big deal to SPY on people!Umake me sick! Very very scary and it's a slippery slope

So, did the NYTimes and other "respectable" news outlets lie about wiretapping? Why isn't that a story??
Great! Subpoena his tax return, too. End the uncertainty. Do it for the country. 
patriotic Americans HATE LINDSEY
We know Obama camp is crooked. Just like Billary was/is. I don't look for truth from any of them @LindseyGrahamSC
You've got to be kidding, @ValerieJarrett.

#FISA #wiretapping #obamagate 
@michelleoverby2 @CNN Graham is an idiot. He thinks wiretap required an order from Obama? It was an illegal wiretap nothing on paper
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN why are you going to waste taxpayers valuable time and $ on this dude's irrational claims and impulsive whims?
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN we need Sessions and Trump investigated in the Russian triangle
@LindseyGrahamSC @POTUS should be held accountable to the high standards the executive office mandates!
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN the fact that you want Trumps  BS investigated and not the Russians involvement in our gov proves you need 2go
While you are at it subpoena what the FBI has on Trump and his Russian ties. Do what u were elected to do. StopBS
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN Fortune favors the bold Senator 
Manu, that isn't remotely what Lindsay said. In fact, he implied that the warrant was probably legally obtained.
Obama was NEVER mentioned by graham. Bad reporting.
HE SEES A MICROPHONE & CANT HELP HIMSELF, HE HAS TO BAD MOUTH HIS OWN PARTY
.@mkraju @LibertyBelleJ @CNN He's gonna have to
@LindseyGrahamSC Check out Circa's Report on Russian/Trump/FBI
What's the endgame here? He knows there were no taps.
these  men are a joke
I expect Sen. Graham to behave in a politically motivated fashion. He is not an honest broker.
So I expect if you're honest that when you find no evidence, you'll say Trump lied -lying is an impeachable offense
@LindseyGrahamSC do something that matters. GOP is wasting time tracing CONSPIRACY THEORIES!! What about Russia?!?!
Please dodo!
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN but not willing to punish Russia's interference. Or Sessions lies, or @POTUS       accusations of @POTUS44 WOW
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN Sir, but not willing 2 subpoena 45's tax returns to further help clear up this mess. #shame #CountryOverParty
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN yes let's indulge the tax evader by investigating baseless accusations. Great use of taxpayer resources.
@LindseyGrahamSC thank you for being the voice of reason!!!
@LindseyGrahamSC And then will you investigate @realDonaldTrump ties to the Kremlin? Or is this just a dog-&-pony show again?
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN why not be so committed to investigating Trump's connection w the Russian election hacking or his tax returns?
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN Thank you as 45 allegations are serious and should be investigated. You were right, 45 is Bat S#*t Crazy.
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN SUBPOENA TRUMP'S TAX INFORMATION. THAT'S WHAT AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED. If Trump  lied again he must be charged.
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN   Your POTUS is crazy and drive me away from being a republican. Friggen losers
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN Yes, prove that he is a lier.  I am quoting you:Sen. Lindsey Graham: Donald Trump is a 'jackass'
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN subpoena re-wire tap? What about Russia? Patriot? American?
He must know they scrubbed the records. Graham is an American Traitor.
@CNNnewsroom @CNN And what about Trump's taxes or Russia or potential violations of the emoluments clause?
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN Thank you for putting country first! You have earned my respect 
...despite the fact that a President can't order wiretaps ...the Congress decides to investigate based on unfounded allegations
great use of taxpayer resources...NOT!  Interesting he won't pay taxes but certainly can easily waste them.
@colattesipper  knew graham wouldn't last. Rightesness only sticks short time on repubicans
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN With Graham it is one step forward and two steps back.
...if there is evidence that compelled a judge to authorize a wire tap, I don't think the WH would want that to be made public
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN so you want to investigate baseless wiretap claims but not acknowledged Russia collusion? Wow. #gophypocrisy
in the bag for trump i guess. no investigation on russia, but one disproven tweet by trump and off he goes

Ts politics something else!! Why I'm so glad d GOOD LORD above has given me ur colleage @BrookeBCNN 2 hold & She's #BrookemyAngel
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN omg you have drank the Koolaid!! I'm embarrassed.
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN thank you for taking up the cause. US would like to know wire tap was real and what it was addressing.
He needs to be just as vigilant in getting to the bottom of the Trump-Russia connection. Treason cannot be ignored
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN what about an invetigation on @POTUS russian connections
Thank you, sir, thank you!  For once you have made me, your constituent, happy!
Thank you!!
There is more evidence supporting Russia influencing Trump's election than Trump's claim? Are you going to make Trump testify?
Are you going to subpoena Trump's tax returns to investigate the Russians' influence on the election & the administration?
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN our Senator never saw a microphone or camera he didn't like.
Senator, your president has you chasing ghosts. This is the same man who fueled the Birther movement.
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN we need to see Trump's tax returns.  And maybe we will find out what Trump is really up to!
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN How about questioning Sessions on his April 27th 2016 meeting at the National Interest Trump speech.
Last o checked the National Interest is pro Putin and run by a Russian born American. The Russian Ambassador
is almost always considered Russian.  So between the two, it pertains to Trump campaign talking with Russians
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN get Trump's tax returns too!
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN funny how he is quick to subpoena for Trumps lies but the Russian investigation takes forever.
I guess you are right. Maybe the GOP will open their eyes.
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN Thank you Senator Graham.
how about subpoenaing DJT for his "info"?!?
This statement makes sense to me, Senator. It's a necessary move for the country, stated in a low key.
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN Someone needs to!Support our President or go home!
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN but nothing for the people of Flint? #FlintWaterCrisis is domestic terrorism but you don't give a damn
All of a sudden Trump plays nice with Graham.  Could it be that Trump is needing allies in Senate if Obama wiretapping false?
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN That's because he is a never Trumper!
Go ahead, but don't mind that we will hold you accountable for it, Graham. Your last term!
I love your reporting and especially when it's Sen. Graham and Sen. Schiff 
@LindseyGrahamSC with no evidence other than Breitbart?  Maybe use some of the evidence about Russia to investigate Trump?
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN #Obama tapped phones without warrants in the past: #AP #Fox and #Merkel and @SenFeinstein . #Tatiana
keyword fox....BS
if there is one its thru FISA.&any of the 5eyes cld have tapped him.u guys are so clueless
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN Get it done!!
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN What about Sessions?!
@JoeGreen753  @CNNPolitics @JamesComeyFBI @TheJusticeDept @MSNBC @jasoninthehouse @RepAdamSchiff @quinncy
@LindseyGrahamSC  ...Trump's Twitter feed will be the only thing you'll get...
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN Perfect. This will help the American public realize that Trump's word is untrustworthy.
.@mkraju @SarahTheNasty @CNN Talk is cheap, as is, history shows us, Lindsey Grahm's integrity. Put up or go down with the traitors.
@LindseyGrahamSC when are we gonna stop being distracted and investigate RUSSIA
Great job flagging him down. Thought for a sec he was going to breeze by
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN 

@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN he should subpoena @realDonaldTrump
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN LET'S GO!
.@mkraju but @LindseyGrahamSC refuses to do jack about Trump's DAILY Constitutional violations & illegal activities. Pathetic.
@CNNnewsroom @CNN #Vault7 makes even more plausible to call for an investigation.The MSM corrupted the Intel Services for headlines.
Good! Disgusting that it was done!  Obama tried to ruin our country!
@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN Then do it...For God's sake...get it done!!!
@joshrogin @CNN 

Graham and McCain are searching for reason for existence.
i love @mkraju stalking the hallways and basement! they cant escape him!
see what Loretta Lynch knows. Time for @BarackObama & Hillary to answer to @realDonaldTrump
Ooooo Twilight Zone time. Lame.
Do we know how long the DOJ has to respond?
DOJ doesn't have to respond. They're independent from Congress & POTUS. 3 branches are SEPARATE. Judicial/Exec/Legislative.
Graham mentioned a subpoena, so I just wondered what the implications would be there.
yEster day 1 said initial participation would be by invite, but if it came down to it they would supeona.
@CNNnewsroom @CNN While you are at it Senator Graham let's  subpoena Trump's Tax returns.
you mean Trump's "paynotax returns"
@ImpactDemocracy @CNN I wish he was as proactive on investigating Trumps Russian connections!
Hey Lindsey, why don't you subpoena Trump's tax returns? Did you give Trump your phone number so that you can collude with him?
Hopefully, he's doing this to prove the fake president made the whole thing up.
Of course it's made up! Trump is so jealous of Obama its craziness! 
I love the Mccain/Graham Manu hallway chats, they're lovely vignettes and I wish this could be a show "Hallway chats with Manu"
good to hear
.@mkraju @joshrogin Love how Manu pretends this was chance encounter. He is go-to mouthpiece for McCain and Mrs. Lieberman.
subpoena Sessions and make him knock down Trump-boy's BS
nice corridor...
Manu, you crack me up. I love watching you lurking the halls of Congress.
