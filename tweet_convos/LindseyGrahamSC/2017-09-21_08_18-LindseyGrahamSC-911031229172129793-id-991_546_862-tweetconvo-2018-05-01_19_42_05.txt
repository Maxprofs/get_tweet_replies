I have a special needs son and pay no where near that.  We can all cherry pick an example
Has this been sourced?
Fact check that now #CNN @CNN

Does this child require extensive care, expensive medications, Life support?  That is an extreme case.  And I think you will say anything.
You will have blood on your hands. You are crooks who only care about your money. You are crooked criminals of lowest rung.
And u think its going to be cheaper under your plan?   I have some swamp land to sell u.  Lol
#FIRSTDONOHARM
Country before party....
he is lying
It will be more under GrahamCassidy.
LA "man" is just another invention like welfare queens. @BillCassidy Show me this "man"
I don't believe these reports. This tab would bankrupt most. He's not really paying this
How is that guy going to pay his HC when the coverage for son goes away or increases 50%.  He is lying to this man. This man's son in danger
John McCain should have to pay these kind of health care bills!  He needs to do what is necessary to replace the failed Obama care.
MEDICARE FOR ALL!!!
So you, instead, wanna take coverage away from millions? The lack of logic is astounding.
You're a liar. ,   on 
FIX is the word of the day !
With your bill, he would be paying more because pre existing conditions would not be covered. Maybe the Koch bros will help them out...
Whose fault was it for Louisiana to refuse Medicaid expansion? Republicans! Stop the crocodile tears. Obamacare would have helped him.
Then fix don't break the system. This is a lie.
@BillCassidy will be running in 2018, lets tell him how much we aprecate him trying to take healthcare away from millions by voting him out!
That's questionable. But he would probably have to pay all of his bills under your bill. Insurance industry doesn't want to pay anything.
Would have been waaaay more before Obama care. This is ridiculous.
Rushing your proposal through without debate, and then spouting off on FOXNews is not very convincing.
And booted under TrumpsCare
Your bill is a violation of the Hippocratic oath.
Liar, and in red states the Gop is to blame for the cost issues.
@LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy then fix it instead of repealing it.  Sabotaging it by shutting down the enrollment site is a disgrace.
I'm sure this is just another lie you have created. Fix ACA and move on. Your a zero not a hero.
$0 under Graham Cassidy because he will have no insurance
Dishonest https://www.facebook.com/rpatino2/posts/10103042584238752 …
Well at least he has it under your plan it's 100%
What about the millions that will lose their coverage period #standup
Tell scumbag mccain
thank god for @jimmykimmel helping to make sure that man can keep his 40k/yr health insurance premium luxury
Healthcare for Preexisting conditions should not force us into poverty.
But IN FACT the bill does nothing to ASSURE that the premium won't be even higher or fail to cover the preexisting condition! Why lie?!
And under your bill how much will it cost him even if he could get coverage? $100k, $200k? If u pricks didn't sabotage ACA, it would be less
More @GOP lies Bill Cassidy wants to kill me by allowing insurance Co to take away my coverage bc I have Cancer. If this passes, I WILL DIE!
Yeah, and Cassidy's the guy who lied to Jimmy Kimmel's face. He's got all the charm of a snake oil salesman.
But under your bill. Won't they pay more if they want to keep the same coverage?
Did LA? Expand Medicaid?
Delusional.
@BillCassidy might want to look at this chart. The $40k he says this guy pays is going up, by about $4400
Expand Medicaid you guys, so this father can help his son. But you won't do that because that's not what you care about.
Liar! Nothing but a Bold Faced Liar
That dude is gonna be pissed when he finds out your bill will let insurance companies price gouge him because of his child's condition
We know the real motivation, so quit the phony hanky-wringing over people probably invented by Frank Luntz.
Compared to the $35,000 annual income for a family of 4 whose 2 kids are in similar condition and pays $200ish a month under #Obamacare ?
Fox News Is Fake News!
He's lieing through his teeth. You can tell 'cause his lips are moving.

That is just sick... taking away the one thing that that man needed!
@BillCassidy @LindseyGrahamSC
It will be more under your plan, sir.
And he won't be helped by this new repeal.  He'll be in worse shape.But the GOP has always hated the poor but continues to yell about Jesus.
Under the dog's breakfast that is #GrahamCassidy that son could be refused health care by private insurance.
Wait till that man finds out he will be paying a lot more.
@BillCassidy This story is very misleading. Under the ACA, he can't be charged more than others because of his son's preexisting condition.
If his family size & earning too much to get premium support caused his premiums to be that high, that's the kind of thing we should fix.
Your bill will do nothing for that man and his family. It will just gut healthcare coverage for millions of others.

Big: GOP Senator Susan Collins confirms Graham-Cassidy would gut protections for pre-existing conditions:

http://www.pressherald.com/2017/09/22/collins-says-shes-leaning-against-voting-for-graham-cassidy-health-care-bill/ … 
Personally, as somewhat who buys insurance from the Marketplace,  am horrified at your plan.


That Republicans are bribing Murkowski by letting Alaska KEEP OBAMACARE pretty much destroys the idea that this is better than Obamacare

Graham-Cassidy isn’t an aberration; it’s more like the distilled essence of everything wrong with modern Republicans https://nyti.ms/2yhNLnR 
Investigated this a bit.  Yes, it can happen but it's very rare and that's one thing that the bipartisan ACA repair was addressing.
It has nothing to do with a preexisting condition.  I guess it's a perfect storm of admin issues that would be fixed.
This could have been fixed years ago but you guys wouldn't address it.
How did the Louisiana man pay for healthcare before the ACA?
Fix Obamacare !
Well why didn't you stop it where were you the GOP is in charge why didn't you get rid of it . More talk talk and do nothing for America
Before the ACA, I couldn't get health insurance AT ALL and many doctors wouldn't see me. Now I have expanded medicaid and can still work.
Then fix it, don't take away. That $40, 000 would be higher with your tax bill plan.

One anecdote is not an rationalization of your awful bill
So he's trying to make things worse by allowing insurance companies to discriminate against those w/pre-existing conditions. Awful.
Then freaking stop talking and FIX it. Seven years we have been hearing that you will. When you have the chance, crickets.
Such LIARS! The bunch of you Trumpies!
REPUBS Get This Healthcare Bill Passed! We Need It!

Funny how you fail to mention that if this death bill goes thru that little boy will be denied coverage... you guys are assholes

That's b/c YOU & JINDAL REJECTED ACA for Louisiana, fool. Under ACA, this guy's costs would've been near zero.
Go on honey, lie some more. All of your credibility is gone!
Hey @billcassidy let's talk.Pre-ACA my daughter was denied insurance because she was born with heart defects.#beentheredonethat
ONLY @SenSanders' #MedicareForAll!!!
So @GOP plan makes him pay more.
WHAT ABOUT GOLDEN SHOWERS?!
How much does that father of disabled child think he will pay w/Trumpcare? Will be liable for millions after insurance drops their coverage
No pre-existing condition protections under Trumpcare. Son wouldn't be covered,cost $100,000 w GOP plan. #SInglePayer much more affordable.
@Nataliew1020 shares the story of her child who's life has been saved by the #ACA & #Medicaid

This is my son. He's a good soul who deserves better than the #CassidyGraham bill. His life & all s are at RISK! .@GOP VOTE NO!!

I take 38 different yearly
15 daily
12 Infusions yearly for #Lupus
w/o #ACA I could NOT afford my MEDS!…
If he paid that much, he must be a millionaire.
Good then tell your @GOP holdouts to repeal it
Louisiana can apply for xtra money 2 off set his costs but more than that why do U allow an ins company 2 get away with this go after them

and will pay 80,000 with this new crap of a healthcare bill they don't tell ya that
Louisiana man is no better off under #GrahamCassidy GOP #DeathCare. Lose cover or pay higher costs. How's that better?
Cassidy is a LIAR. He only supports this bill because THEY PAID HIM TO.
Pass this bill Obamacare has destroyed the individual market & ones choice for coverage.
How much a year does the man make?  200k?
Fix ACA don't throw 32 million people to the curb. People wonder why they call the GOP heartless.
 is not healthy
Wait til he doesn't have insurance at all. It's coming, these assholes are going to kill millions with Trumpcare
How will this new bill help people like him?
Woohoo! Let it pass! We will feel Satan love on us as people scream out in agony! Rituals by the lake tonight! #MAGA #NaziPower #HeilTrump
LIAR LIAR! Maybe the GOP network- FOX- will do an exposé on the millions that benefited from Obamacare?... nah, why start telling the truth?
As opposed to what? $1,000,000 under your scam of a bill?
New plan needs to address COST. Mandates and taxes are secondary to what ACA has done. Slush fund to welch off America is what it is.  #MAGA
Stop the #GrahamCassidyBill #ProtectOurCare @GOP don't care if U Die, get Sick, need surgery, or any female needs @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr
Oh @BillCassidy you "better not to lie to we the people" Just look at that smile, it says "that face says, you just got screwed big time" 
How the hell does your plan fix this?
#SinglePayer #MedicareForAll
He'll pay a lot more under your shit bill because nothing will be covered
Ha ha ha, great story Bill. Great job sabotaging ACA to make that story resonate with your stupid voters! Keep up the good work!
Much better that his son should have no coverage at all. Pre-existing condition insurance will skyrocket under this plan.

#BREAKING: All 50 Medicaid directors come out against GOP bill to repeal ObamaCare http://hill.cm/h25skCt  
And you think it's going to be better under this terrible bill?  No. Millions more will lose coverage. Preexisting conditions not protected.
Lies lies lies!
A message to @BillCassidy:
I should cc @LindseyGrahamSC on this one.
New plan is better than ACA, get it done! Repeals the mandate! Pls vote yes! Ya'll can't run on R&R or tax reform in 18 or 20! Just do it!

There is no state south of the Mason-Dixon line that can be trusted with healthcare.  Federal oversight is essential!
Back up what you say, show the actual receipt or bill from ins company.
Like Paul Ryan & the kids lunch.
Explain how ~30 million Americans uncovered is a better option?
... so @BillCassidy would like everyone else to pay $40,000 per year too, instead of fixing that person's coverage issue? BAD IDEA.
@BillCassidy do not think you can fool God or country! This "City on a Hill" made it through Nixon, we will make it through u & trump!
So why screw the rest of your state
Under your bill, it'll likely jump to $120k or they lose their insurance because of his pre-existing condition. Stop muting to people! #Liar
Just wate until he sees what he'd pay if this bill went through! And only insurance that covers profound special needs is Medicaid.
Why are we not holding the insurance companies responsible?
Your bill will not fix the problem. STOP LYING

If your talking more than #300 per year then your talking about eliminating Pre-Existing Conditions to replace w-More MONEY to allow that.
So what is it Government Need over Medical Need over Individual Need for Insurer Need instead using bundles of Individual's money bricks?
The answer is to fix ACA not replace it with the crap Cassidy plan.  Check your ego and not your campaign coffers.
Before Obamacare in 2003 had 2 pay $80k and sell my house to pay for daughter with Down Syndrome  problem @BillCassidy New Plan samething
Hit broad sided by a Long Term Medical Insurance Plan which should only cost at least $300 a year for a Veteran & others in need fooling WHO
How much more would he pay without it?. #ACA #saveobamacare
If your plan is so great, why are you offering to exempt Alaska to get Murkowski's vote?
That's because Louisiana with their REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR&REPS did NOT PARTICIPATE in the INSURANCE EXCHANGES! SHAME on them!
Why do you sabotage ACA??
Those GOP a-holes would throw people's healthcare out the door to satisfy their rich donors! #KillTheBill
To be fair, how much would he be paying under your proposed death sentence, er..., I mean..., healthcare plan? #CassidyGraham
You guys are terrible at legislating.  And governing.
All 50 state Medicaid Directors condemn it in the strongest terms.
#BREAKING: All 50 Medicaid directors come out against GOP bill to repeal ObamaCare http://hill.cm/h25skCt

STOP pulling the wool over U.S. citizens eyes. Post the details for all to see. SHAME ON GOP, Shame of YOU.
I just don't believe this.  Prove it!
