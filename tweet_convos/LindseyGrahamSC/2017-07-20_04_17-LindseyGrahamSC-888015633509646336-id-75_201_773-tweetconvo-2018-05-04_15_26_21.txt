I was moved by your honest emotion for your friend, @SenJohnMcCain, & truly sorry this happened 2 such a fine man. Hes 1 of the good guys.
Here's my friend Crystal. Mom of 4, 29 yrs old. Fighting T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. It may be in her brain/kidneys. She's scared.
Shouldn't all Americans have access to the same level of good healthcare @SenJohnMcCain is receiving? A question with a one word answer. . .
You gonna miss your fuck buddy?
Maybe you'll  be able to SUCK another load out of him before he expires.  No I have no sympathy for any of you.
No respect for any of these #LOSERS
Niether have the Republicans
I felt your pain and I'm sorry. You're a good and steadfast friend. Be strong, there are a lot of well wishers pulling for both of you.
No man can chose his birth. Some men can chose their death All men can chose eternal life, or death. Traitor to GOD & country hard to defend
@LindseyGrahamSC Imagine John McCain going thru what he's going thru without health insurance. Please vote "NO" on repeal and replace.
Don't deny health care to Americans..vote NO on health care!!
Nice comment Senator @LindseyGrahamSC.  It is nice to see politicians speak with authenticity.
Meanwhile,  his party is giving the middle- finger to Americans on their healthcare.
Not speaking about his party now. It's about a hero with brain cancer.
Amen! McCain endured yrs of horror as a P.O.W. & has dedicated his life 2 public service. He's earned our respect.
Poor #SouthCarolina Senatorita Lindsay, he has the sads. #sctweets #scgop
I'm so sorry 4 the pain you must be feeling about your friend John. Best wishes 2 u both.We need the real Republicans and you guys are rare.
I like this guy
Senator, my thoughts are with you and your best buddy @SenJohnMcCain
Your statement moved me to tears. He's lucky to have such good friends. Positive thoughts.
Senator Graham I may not always agree with you or Senator McCain but I respect you both. I am sorry your best maverick has such a battle
Me. Graham, I need u 2 b a patriot vote "no" on repealing ObamaCare & make McCain vote "no" to GOP's DeathCare.
Please get better, we need you. I am Canadian and DT is a criminal mob president who has always operated outside the law. Need you to fight.
He Will Rise from His Respite
Yea thanks to #ACA all senators have great coverage and the best doctors. Too bad @SenateGOP want to throw everyone else over the cliff.
THIS IS NOT A FIGHT. THAT'S THE OUTMODED AND SUREFIRE AND FASTEST WAY TO GO.
DO NOT FIGHT, SENATOR McCain. Now is the time to take 'er easy.
Best wishes to @SenJohnMcCain AND 58% in favor of #SinglePayer! Healthcare in the US is going to be the death of us. We need to switch now!
@LindseyGrahamSC Your interview broke my heart. McCain will tear that cancer a new A..Hole! We'll keep you all in our prayers.
and of all the tributes Trumps was the weakest of all..but he demeaned McCain during the campaign. right now we all pray for McCain
@SenJohnMcCain is one of our country's biggest heros. We love him and want him back in your arms in Congress. We love you both & praying 4 u
John mccain
In his honor you in Congress should make sure you do things right. Don't screw us maybe, in his honor.
So sorry to hear the news about your friend. You handled the announcement with such grace and dignity! Fight the good fight!
IDEA:
Re-name (and pass) the Congressional Russian sanction bill in honor of John McCain.
@LindseyGrahamSC How about you let the man recover peacefully instead of rushing him back. You're a monster
Graham says McCain is reviewing his medical options and uncertain when he'll be able to return to the Senate
Sir, I know you and Senator McCain are very close friends. My, and all Americans thoughts are with you as well. Sen. McCain will prevail!
God speed Mr McCain as we send our prayers ur way.
Truth is ordinary Americans get cancer as well-his Congressional hlth insurance will provide great care-why is GOP anti same care for others
Senator McCain is in our prayers! Stay strong for your good friend, Sen. Graham!
@LindseyGrahamSC Respectfully, best wishes to @SenJohnMcCain 
Please understand avg American w/cancer deserves access, not fear losing cvrge
Well it's bout time God striking him down for all the VET'S he helped the VA kill over the years
Help John. There is hope. Research #RickSimpsonoil.  #phoenixtears.
Praying for McCain, but wish you would realize most Americans are one illness away from bankruptcy. Same level of ins should be for all.
Wish McCain a speedy recovery. Wish all us cancer patients had access to the superior h/c, or any h/c to help battle our fight.
I knowUR pain,my husband/bestfriend had Glioblastoma.So glad John has you 4 bestfriend IF he needs to share some feelings outside family 1st
Hang in there Senator.  He's going to beat it.
Trump firing all those investigating Russia dealings.Looks like a coverup.Repubs swore oath to uphold our Consititution not side with Pres.
@LindseyGrahamSC and @SenJohnMcCain have a wonderful friendship and seeing Graham stand behind McCain always is heart-warming. G-d Bless!
Truer words were never spoken. God bless you both, as I know you keep fighting the battles in Congress for all of us as well.

Praying for Senator McCain
The doting wife.. 
I think he meant candidate, not opponent.
Prayers for healing and health @JohnMcCainDaily

You DO realize the GOP is playing politics with our HEALTHCARE, right?
Yes. I've been protesting in front of Collin's and Poliquin's offices regularly.  I've also read the oath that McCain took for US Navy.
Regarding McCain's brain cancer, all we heard were idiotic statements without scientific basis.
I wonder if John McCain is enrolled in Obamacare.
Why?  Obamacare doesn't treat cancer?
你好
Amen!
swift recovery
