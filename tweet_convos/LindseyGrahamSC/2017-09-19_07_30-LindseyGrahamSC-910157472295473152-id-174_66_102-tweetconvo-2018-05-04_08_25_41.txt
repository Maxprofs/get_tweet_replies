A bill -- finalized yesterday, has not been scored, amendments not allowed, and 3 hours final debate -- should be viewed with caution.
Tom Cotton also thinks we need more people in jail, because he benefits from modernized slavery.
How is this breaking news scumbags always stick together
I want my tax dollars to pay for health care for others.  You know where you can shove your federalism.
What about the universal wage?
Absolutely, even for you, my friend.
I will never turn down free money!!!!
Well there's a ringing endorsement, ha! Horrible person backs horrible idea proposed by other horrible people.
Breaking? @SenTomCotton has FREE health insurance for him and his family! Why would he care about anyone else but other rich insured people?
You only see the turn, you don't see the road ahead.....Jaime Escalante.
Many will suffer and die

Now try to get @RandPaul on board
Really!  Do you Republicans wake up every morning thinking of ways to hurt folks?
I believe you do this.
I wouldn't try to take away Graham's healthcare.  That would make me a monster.  But HE is trying to do just this to MILLIONS.
This evil criminal who took a million from Iran? Needs to be voted out
Of COURSE he does. He's evil.
Ignorant SC voters need to wake up.
Well, he shouldn't. People will die.
Sure he does-he's as mean-spirited&soulless as rest of Reps! Yank healthcare from millions, price out those w/pre-existing conditions...
Hey @TomCottonAR hope you enjoyed your last election win. This is suide
Shocking

No conserv who cheers ripping away the insurance for babies born with critical diseases (for tax cuts) can EVER claim to be pro-life again.
That's not breaking. Tom lives for the idea of taking healthcare coverage from folks.
Notably, Graham won't engage on the substance of Kimmel's argument, or allow for a CBO score that would tell us who's really lying. https://twitter.com/burgessev/status/910524514899038209 …

Tom Cotton is shameful as well...
What kind of evil people would endorse this?
Under this bill, pregnancy will cost you an extra 17K. Metastatic cancer 172K. Autism 5K. Asthma 4K. This isn't a healthcare bill.
The biggest money grubbing scumbag in the Senate? Of course. #treasonoustom
Why do these people have a problem with Americans having health insurance. These people are the true Un-Americans.
Just don't want to hear no sad stories, because I'm sure there will be some.
It's not like they're going to carve out some special health plan for them. But you know sometimes people have to go through it too know it.
I don't see Trump's lower class citizen voters benefiting from any republican plan.
As a matter fact the only thing you ever hear comes out of the republicans mouths is let's help the rich so they can get richer.
The republicans language is very clear if you're not the fortunate then you don't deserve it.
Lets be real Graham, Cassidy, Cotton and many other republicans are not going to do things in the best interest of America people.
It's not surprising.
Of course he does, @SenTomCotton doesn't care about his #constituents. The #KochBros gave him 8 million reasons to let people die.
You're still fake news.
HE will be voted OUT TOO
Yet @SenTomCotton won't release a statement explaining why he backs anything without a CBO score. He's antiAmerican.
#votethemout before they kill us all
Because he is vying for a career in politics and will use any means to gain that control and power. He's a wannabe.
All of you Trump acolytes will have a reconing. I hope you you get sick and have no health insurance and way to pay. You actually deserve it
Third stage cancer, no healthcare, do not qualify. Cancer is not a life event. Open enrollment in November. No treatment until then
Another cruel and evil senator!
Just like you @LindseyGrahamSC
Hurricanes. N Korea. Russian cyber warfare & you're fixated on throwing 20-30 million off health care! Damn you all! NO on #GrahamCassidy
What else would you expect from this traitor?
Is this news?  It would be news if he didn't back it. To people like Tom Cotton, the party is his master.
@LindseyGrahamSC you keep saying working for the American people then listen to them.  FIX ACA your bill is horrific screwing Americans
I hope you sleep well at night knowing that your career has been devoted to pandering to the stupid and the greedy. You must be proud.
@LindseyGrahamSC this is not an overhaul you are still screwing Americans. Increased co pays, increased $$ for preexisting FIX ACA
Tom Cotton is a fool...just putting that out there...
Good news! Hopefully you will make it happen with some compromises! Hopefully you'll get strong support from @POTUS & @VP!
Of course he does because cotton is a despicable excuse for a human
Well what a surprise since he is a total, heartless sellout
You don't say.

One lying conman supports another lying conman -- big whoop! Shame on you both.
He is making a big mistake
Of course he does. But here comes 2018!! Bye GOP
Why is this anything to be proud of? Another person who won't be on this terrible plan, that's an endorsement?
No surprise here!  Just another #RepublicanPOS
Shocker he is no good either
#Graham is an officer, but is no gentleman. @LindseyGrahamSC doesn't care how veterans or POWs are denigrated or denied care.#iserved #USAF
Obamacare is wealth redistribution, profiting insurance companies and shrinking the middle class so we can become equalistic like Venezuela
Tom taking care of Arkansas migrant workers..
Another fake Christian.
These people will do anything to pander to Trump and get GOP votes. Even take healthcare from our NEEDIEST Americans. SHAME ON ALL OF YOU!
"Rat-a-tat-tat
"Poor Planning on your part, Don't constitute an Emergency on Our Part!!"
How many more Americans will have better and more affordable healthcare coverage under this bill than have it today?
The rats are trying to scramble and come up with a bill 7 years  Now that POTUS has higher approval ratings than Congress

JUST OUT: Here's a summary of the Graham-Cassidy repeal. Yes, it's that bad.

Spread far and wide if useful. 
If Douchebags @SenSchumer & @JohnKasich hate Graham/Cassidy, I LOVE it and I am ALL IN! #VoteYes #MAGA #PassPOTUSAgenda
Watch the VIDEO. Find out what is really in the bill. On @MSNBC with @JRubinBlogger
Sure he does.
THESE MEN ARE LIARS @BillCassidy  @LindseyGrahamSC
JUST IN: American Medical Association comes out against new ObamaCare repeal bill http://hill.cm/UrYXlMA  
And this is shocking news why exactly?
VOTE NO

#GreatReads: The staggering hypocrisy of Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham: http://bit.ly/2xkjGXg  @mattyglesias 
Will Congress put themselves on it? If not, it will NOT be a good HC bill. They need taken off the HC they have now that the ppl pay for.
#BREAKING 
All Republicans enter the largest circle jerk of all time stroking their egos and making their pockets fatter. 
#healthcare
GrahamCassidy will determine their legacy. That they are both evil and care nothing about the people of this country. Killing/bankrupting is
Of course he does. What did they promise his state ?
Despite it hurting his state.  Makes you wonder who he works for.
Your wrong @TomCottonAR both #ACA & Graham-Cassidy are reworked Med Insurance Policy Plan Don't need Health Care INS assurance for Med INS!
Congrats on picking up this idiots vote. You know if it's screwing over poor sick people @TomCottonAR is there for you.
Great now get their support for Raise
Of course he does.  He's another Obama hating POS.
Shame on all of you! Sickness and death from our citizens with no health insurance will be on YOU, GOP, & Lindsey Graham. Cruel hypocrites.
Big surprise.  NOT.

Oh my gosh, really???
Why didn't Senate return to regular order? What are you afraid of? Passing a bad bill is worse than no bill! Block grants are a joke #shame

#Trumpcare show everyone that the #GOP doesn't care about you, especially if you have life-threatening conditions.@LindseyGrahamSC
@SenTomCotton let's screw some more vets over 1.75M vets will lose coverage. Never speak of taking care of vets again!
Nothing is more brutal. Live my life where cancer is not considered a life event according to Obamacare or ACA. Not able to get insurance

Despicable.  You are dealing with people's lives.  Make sure Congress must also have Trumpcare if you're going to vote for it.
NEWSFLASH! Terrible senator backs terrible idea! Stop the presses!
Big surprise, Cotton supports your despicable bill.
.@TomCottonAR Hope ur constituents are pleased w/ ur intended vote to strip hc from 1000s of them & $1.1 billion in federal funds from AR.
Tom Cotton needs to be voted OUT.
Under this bill, people with metastatic cancer will pay $142,650 more a year to get coverage.

That is not reform. That is a death sentence.
vote @gop out
#GrahamCassidy cuts #Medicaid. 1,750,000 veterans covered by Medicaid. A vote for #GrahamCassidy is a vote to take healthcare from veterans.
Kill Americans just for a win disgrace
Americans: You are taking healthcare away from millions of us. Senator Cotton: GOP! GOP! GOP!"
We have enough humanitarian disasters from hurricanes.., why have a man made one by taking away healthcare access?
Shocking. A senator who voted for all the other repeals decides to vote for this one. Perhaps the byline should be #Broken.
https://www.facebook.com/RBReich/videos/1707333839279205/ …
Another hypocrite who can afford health care. SAD
@TomCottonAR What is destroying lives worth to you? Greed over lives!
Glad it's being considered an 'overhaul' now instead of the imbecilic repeal and replace stance. More sensible to enhance what's out there.
He is an idiot. Make sure it applies to all Senators, Reps and Federal employees to include President Trump and family.
You will be reviled by history for this draconian action AGAINST those whom you were elected to serve!
https://www.facebook.com/RBReich/videos/1707333839279205/ …
That's breaking news????
He's ALWAYS a sellout Corporatist Far Right nutjob.

Time to clean the house and Senate in 2018
You are a sell out racist appeasing a traitorous president.

#MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
Our @will_c_fischer says #GrahamCassidy is just #TrumpCare with a new name and still takes health care away from thousands of #veterans. 
I stand with @votevets @RedCross @AmerMedicalAssn @AARP & all others against your abomination of robbing Americans of healthcare!
Cowardly Lindsey will be mocked by future historians. SAD!
Time to aim the tasers at Paul?
Pelosi.Schumer,MurkOWSKI,Collins,&MCCAIN -politicians blocked it-only five against POTUS and the rest of the nation>De-bar.Rogue.Judges
He will never be reelected again.
Yes he will. This bill makes poor, brown people suffer. That's what his voters wanted when they elected him.
