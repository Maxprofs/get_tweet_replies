This is why Russia knows Obama blows hot air.  He draws red lines with China and Russia.  They cross these lines!
So, you feel better with ISIS in charge?

Potus makes the judgement call : no more US boots in the ground. No dead US soldiers : win for America.
@overrunbydogs The majority of us are NOT fox news propaganda followers Sorry to burst your bubble Maybe  gop will wake up
@overrunbydogs Pres Obama made the right choice so our military would not be used as 'target practice'. Hard but good call
false flag chemical attacks by US armed "rebels" don't count @VivaLaAmes @BrittPettibone @FluffyDogAttack
@page_8965 in 3 weeks there will be a gop president and gop congress. We're watching. Show us your way

No. Middle East has been at war forever. We have to look at national interests. Never should have invaded Iraq.

As a parent, I agree. Never make threats you won't carry through on.
No lying Lindsey. It was a bad idea to be toppling foreign governments. Publicly debate Paul on it all coward.

@overrunbydogs Our military would  have a bulls eye painted on their backs in Syria. Putin, Assad, Iran wouldn't care We do

Sir Short memory? Aug 31 2013? @POTUS asked for a vote Also did your ever get around to a new AUMF?
Do you have  solution?
Too bad a feckless Congress didn't back the president up when he wanted to strike Assad in 2013
too good you mean?
I knew congress was asleep at the wheel when they were unmoved by pictures of 1000s tortured to death in Syrian government death camps
Yes but they were Obama's red lines which he said would have consequences if crossed, then did nothing when they were.
Please IMPEACH TRUMP ASAP. Our country is at stake.
fact is if Assad was defeated Isis would be running Syria and we would have a huge mess on our hands!
On the bright side, we'll soon be free of that pesky health insurance. Why let Assad kill Americans when we have the GOP?
it's a great day to mind your business
@overrunbydogs Not to mention it appeases Bibi Which is ridiculous because we should abstain. US does not support apartheid
@overrunbydogs Mr. Graham, the gop has been itching to go to war with Iran ever since the peace deal. Distraction gop MO.
@overrunbydogs But hey, it's Trump's buddy Putin, so it's all good, right?
Even Senators  McCain & Graham  said Saturday that they might vote no because the president’s plan was too limited? Got it.
Must address that macro problem (China-Rus aliance) which threatens US on every front, & kick China habit, all else micro
Senate Rep foreign policy types need 2 begin close session conference w/ Trump nominees to strategize now over China-Russia

Senator- the Obama foreign policy is disastrous- spitting On Israel/ & now the Russia BS w/no evidence- do your job Lindsey
Thanks for speaking the truth.
Don't worry, bro, Trump will surely obliterate us all and no more Israel, Palestine, Iran, USA, etc. No more worries!
Why do so many seem to despise Lindsey Graham? Not rhetorical. US non-response to Syria has emboldened Putin.
x 
since terror groups aren't part of the ceasefire Hezbollah Iran Shia militia groups are also not part & should leave Syria
How Does #LindseyGraham
Clear #Bilderberg Corps
LNG Pipelines ?
ARMS.  Killing. Clearing.
#Syrians From on top of them.
@LindseyGrahamSC
Our enemies could not have done worse by us had they been running USA, than Obama! Unbelievable mess to fix; very complex.
Stop backing the Terrorists that you call Rebels, do your research.

and Russia Assad Iran also win because the IS must agree to this sell out of Syria or be accused of supporting terrorists
PS. It's all been bad under Obama. Every region of the globe, Mid East, EU, Russia, China, Central America, even Hatie!
Go away Linda. Americans do not care what u have to say.   @lindseygrahamsc
of solution, and that requres some major rethinks and new strategy. Can't continue course that is sinking our ship!
To Answer the Riddle :
A. #LindseyGraham goes
to #Bilderberg Meets to
B. Clear #Assad 
from @ENGIEgroup 
LNG Pipelines
@LindseyGrahamSC
we should not be in the business of throwing out leaders no matter how dispictable.
You and McCain need to realize what we are facing w/China/N Korea-Russian/Iran mil alliance and get w/ Trump team 2 be part
Pelosi and Kerry and others praised Assad during Bush years.  Thought he was very modern.
Nothing should be done to undercut Trump flexibilty to develop new doctrine as current is dissaster (including the Senate).
Perhaps the Question of
Y #LindseyGraham is so
interested in #Syria is
Y he is so interested
in #Bilderberg Group.

@LindseyGrahamSC
China using Russia to tactically undercut us as Russia has cultural insight. Get it? Get the problem in S China sea?
pontificating and dart throwing. So hold your fire until new Admin and then you guys go closed session w/ them & plot plan.
US caused havoc in Iraq,Libya,Palestine but Syria peace agreement thanks to Russia,Iran;no more bad neo-con #HillarysWars
So please quit firing from the hip, right or wrong. We are in the worse global mess ever in US history. Need strategy not..

@EtienneDavignon Bilderg Group
@LindseyGrahamSC
Thus Russia is setting up to become major player in Europe with an alliance w/ China, Iran NK. See what is happening!
Russia even has Turkey now (thus in roads to Turkey) and the French right which are going to win election, with no UK in EU
Obama is attempting to start wars and leave even more dissasters in his wake on way out in order to sabatoge Trump & USA!
Nothing should be done to limit Trump and new teams flexibility to fix the mess we are in; it will be hard enough!
That is going to rewquire a whole new foregn policy doctine. Quit trying 2 lock USA into failed foreign policy!
So pull your head out of the micro weeds as addressing that aliance and kicking China habit is#1 priority!
The largest treat 2 USA is China, and the Chinese/ North Korean aliance with Russia/Iran that can destroy the world.
An entirely new approach is needed on foregn policy globally, & that is for President Truimp 2 do. Quit tyung 2 sabatoge!

@LindseyGrahamSC
So would you be sending troops into Syria? That's the only real way to enforce red line diplomacy.
agree, but without strong secular central government, same would happen. Egypt is example with Islamic Brotherhood.
As predicted by you, but trust that better days are ahead. Keep leading.
To an extent understanding;  With Assad of  (Syria) still never being at an End ; (stopped) always presents a THREAT to USA

Unfortunately Obama is a weak leader - a nice guy, but not presidential material. Trump is tough as nails. So's his team.

crooks
You act like we would not have been fighting ISIS and Assad at same time. Fighting both sides of a civil war is not good.
inguess you forgot your boss did NOTHING TO ASSAD
We're on the wrong side of the red line of history.
And Obama did nothing.
