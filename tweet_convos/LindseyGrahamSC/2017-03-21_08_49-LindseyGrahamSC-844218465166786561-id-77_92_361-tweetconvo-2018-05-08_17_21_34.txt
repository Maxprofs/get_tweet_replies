Listening to Graham whining and not asking questions is embarrassingly painful - and I'm not even a Democrat!
But he is .
Lindsay Graham was disrespectful to our president .he should come out of the liberal closet
@LindseyGrahamSC Great resume, presents well, but the case history of Gorsuch is absolutely appalling.  Hobby Lobby, Trans Am
Gorsuch has a history of siding with corporations over people. NOT a good choice for SCOTUS! #GarlandNotGorsuch
@LindseyGrahamSC Pause this Presidency!!
@LindseyGrahamSC Senator Graham you were a disgrace to SC and to our Nation Today.
Why is King RINO Lindsey Graham even there?  You know he is going to vote with his Democrat buds.
^NOPE, HE THIS CON MAN'S PICK, HE #WILL BE A RUBBER STAMP "FOR HIM" #Token @LyinTrump
@LindseyGrahamSC Disrespect Dems show the POTUS not new-however-its a slap in the Nations face & Repubs when one of our own do it!
Please remove the R by your name and put a D!!!
His record proves he will NOT be independent; planned parenthood, religious freedom, big business. Tows party line
@LindseyGrahamSC The concern  isn't if he will be independent. It's will be as "independent" as he's been in the past.
- We the people are sick of your Liberal BS. Stand with our @POTUS or you may find yourself in the middle of CWII
@LindseyGrahamSC You were doing good until ..(you just couldn't help yourself)..make fun of the POTUS! Sad!
It's not good enough. Gorsuch is #Illegitimate. @POTUS is under @FBI investigation for colluding with enemy.
SC is this really ur Guy?  He and MCCAIN Rhinos  SC voted Trump yet ur guy hates Trump. Hmmm.
@LindseyGrahamSC Garland was a great choice too.
@LindseyGrahamSC graham is a rino and a douche bag threatening the potus time for you to go #midterms
@LindseyGrahamSC Cannot wait to see Lindsey exposed. Guessing he knows Russians have something on him Can only imagine how heinous.
No vote should happen until the #TrumpRussia investigation is completed! Cannot appoint someone if Trump is connected to Russia!
@LindseyGrahamSC @alfranken
Al is dead wrong, the judge was correct, the driver should have not have gone anywhere, just dial 911
FBI INVESTIGATION of RUSSIA&Trump ties; ALL confirmation hearings should STOP "UNTIL WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON!"
How about attacking DEMOCRATS NOT REPUBLICANS OR OUR PRESIDENT. FOOL
Good man hope he makes it
now everyone is finally figuring out that these hearings are a total waste of fucking time! Sorry for cussing but this is SAD!

He's not a politician, so he doesn't have to lie.
We need the "Lindsey Graham/Bernie Sanders" term limits bill ASAP!
I like Judge Gorsuch, in his own way I would say he has a "poker face"

Lindsey Graham is a disgrace to Rep party He just stated his disdain for President Trump so small of him hoping Trump be impeached
@LindseyGrahamSC  Let the Judicial Branch make the selection, not lieing Con-gress members.
@LindseyGrahamSC  There are sooo many lies being told, are these just more on the pile?
@LindseyGrahamSC once again, Graham just trying to stay relevant- had to get in his divisive jabs at our @Potus - #draintheswamp 
Why? He only said what is obvious. He can't hold back what just is known by all.
@GovMikeHuckabee 
Graham isn't a good enough man to even lick  the dirt off of #Gorsuchs shoes
Stay out of private health care decisions. Men have NO right to dictate a woman's decisions regarding her body
@LindseyGrahamSC but all his rulings were for companies over people. He is rubberstamped

When are ppl going to realize this isnt about "sides" or teams anymore. This isnt a Democrat vs. Republican issue. It's a threat to country 
cant say I've much call to believe him
@LindseyGrahamSC
WRONG. His rulings & statements on civil rights, due process & equal protection are disqualifying. NOT impartial.

If Neil Gorsuch honors/serves laws of our Constitution, he'd suggest senate to hold hearings for Obama's nominee first. #StopGorsuch #ATN
Senator Graham....make a point.
Lindsey,  Go Home. TERM LIMITS, TERM LIMITS,  TERM LIMITS
we really need to change the rules of senate and house, to hold members of both bodies liable for slanderous remarks they spew
what about garland tho?
Shh!  Don't say the word 'rubber' too loud.  Bill might be listening...
- Graham' opening speech was excellent!
THANK YOU LINDSEY, and DEMS SHOULD B ASHAMED of themselves 4 the way they are treating Gorsuch, NO WONDER their party is a FAILURE
The last 2 Obama judge's are very highly recommended,liked by all Rubber stamps for the demacrats
Graham is saying what Hamilton said back in 1788. Graham forgets to tell everyone that Sen. were appt by the Gov of their states
@realDonaldTrump Graham for 1st time- love it when u said " Political Garbage".
Lindsey,  you need to ask a real question or Shut Up.
Term limits, TERM LIMITS,  TERM LIMITS
Like you tweet Linsey need out just like McCain
Obama's Supreme Court appointees have been a rubber stamp for Obama during his 8 years
@realDonaldTrump Lyndsey, thanks for enlightening us with history of judge appointing SCOTUS
one would hope the Justices are independent as they are the 3rd arm of gov't. When Trump issues come up we still have law. Rule Law
Sen. Graham stop talking, this isn't about you! #DrainTheSwamp
so Lindsey 12 minutes now bloviating.   What's the question. TERM LIMITS,  TERM LIMITS
