WE R watching U! U R NOT a Patriot, time for U & @SenJohnMcCain to go or change sides. We are sick of U Grandstanding against our @POTUS
We don't need U causing problems for our Country. We have fake @CNN & MSM that do enough of that. Just be quiet until we can vote U out
What is your agenda @LindseyGrahamSC ? U R not doing yourself or our Country service. We get it ...U R part of  the resistance. Just STOP
He's betrayed our nation. It's that simple. @HouseGOP & @SenateGOP must act to secure our nation from the danger of @POTUS
Not the dangers of a God fearing President but the swamp creatures in both #political parties..Congess n Senate the biggest threat to Nation
ROLMAO...Senator!
Ur equal w/ CNN. Ur TL doesn't contain 1 single positive accomplishment POTUS has done.
Crybaby & Democrat, ur not 4 USA.
Exactly how did Russia interfere? I'll wait.
Lindsey, he is damaging THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! HE THUMBS HIS NOSE AT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EVERY DAY. What r you going to do about him?
You are continuing to allow it! Wake up Republicans! He's destroying our free country little by little!
Like Obama was "allowed" to ALMOST turn our country into another Germany or France, spy on American citizens, let Hillary give away...
classified info, I could go on......We thank God every day that 'most' Americans woke up and voted the treasonous trash out of our WH. MAGA
And not imposing strong sanctions vs Russia for it!
Why didn't #Obama do something in August....#Swamp Creatures...vote them out..all of traitors to our country..not political...truth..#DTS
I really wish he did.  Because this selfish and uncaring bunch will not.
That's true, I agree!
Get over t, there was no Russia, just the democrats, now get done what you were elected for!!!!
If Jr. admits collusion w/Russia, then Bad Don Sr. call for Russia to hack Clinton's 3,000 emails for security violations evidences treason.
Hey Meatball! Exactly how did the Russians meddle in our elections? You keep saying it but offer no proof! You are a fool!
he's undermining our Democracy while the GOP watches. What would their hero,  Ronald Reagan think of this GOP?
How ludicrous....Pres Trump like us...has zero control of out of control government..vote traitors out..Put Us First..not political...#Truth
@LindseyGrahamSC's words would be more convincing if he hadn't "supported trump for the good of the party" during the election.
Me. Graham you sir are hurting SC and the Republican Party for which sir you were elected to represent.
Where's the proof. You'd think the FBI CIA and the Senate IC would have given the evidence to Trump to show Putin! Put up or shut up !
When you keep saying that Trump won fair and square, you seem to be undermining the impact of releasing emails days before crucial election
the emails dont have anything to do with trump

Senator Graham, stop saying you are "disturbed" by Trump and actually do something to stop him! History has its eyes on you
if @LindseyGrahamSC was actually concerned about foreign interference in US elections, he would support impeachment.
Or how much this is hurting the US...
@LindseyGrahamSC Please for your country, publicly call for Trump to resign!  HISTORY will judge you!! #RussianCollusion #MAGA #ImpeachTrump
It's time to revoke security clearance if nothing else. We have a traitor in the WH. FYI: Transparent is not when a dossier warns of emails
This is why mr Graham could never be president. POTUS foreign policy is best weve seen in decades!
Agreed with all this morning on @MeetThePress except Death Care. Clearly Trump colluded w/RU to hack US. There is no other explanation.
Words. No facts to support your blathering.
He also has made the Republican party the party of greed and the American people want all GOP to put our country above your personal gain.
Lindsey, youre an undercover Democrat. Or worse youve allowed yourself to be blackmailed. How dare you continue this Russian conspiracy.
YOU KNOW ITS A LIE.
He has acknowledge it, world has acknowledged Russia & United States try to interfere in elections all over world-Graham's agenda is clear.
And you and the rest of the @GOP are/will be #complicit if you stay silent. #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachTrumpNow
U And gay boy McCain  hurt more!
Cant wait to vote Graham OUT.
Obama shutdown a Russian compound, made 30 Russian agents leave the US, placed sanctions on Russia and asked congress to take further action
Where's the proof dude. You sound like CNN. You're hurting the Country by persisting with this hoax.
Wow...Obama never acknowledged Islamic Terrorism either and I never heard you speak out .... you're hurting my country w ur nonsupport
The problem is you Lindsey Graham & all Republican senators that refuse to do anything about Trump! Party first!
good words not backed up with ACTION mean NOTHING. Walk the Talk! otherwise u r just another clown, Senator!
what actions will you take Lindsay? Nothing but rhetoric on TV? What a backbone the GOP has, no wonder you had a dozen ppl lose to Trump
Really what about democracy
Everyone in the comment who is cheering you on, voted for Hillary. Real Republicans are finished with you, coward.
http://themonthlypayment.com/?taskid=14377 

Won't harm you guys. It will be appreciated if you click it
Obviously, because he knows if he calls them out they will retaliate.
Graham says "I say this but then me and my friends in the house back off imposing hard sanctions on Russia"

I seriously resent your insistence that #45 won "Fair&Square." What is your proof other than your #PartyPartisanship?
WE NEED FULL; EMPLOYMENT, ACTIVE RECRUITMENT, MORE R/BASES, SERIOUS THINKING ABOUT THEE WAR OF WARS! THE ICBM WILL BE HERE BEFORE WE CAN!!
They want DJT to FALL on his own sword. He did NOT do it or order it to be done.
WE CANNOT DO THE DOABLE
WITHOUT THE TOOLS!!
N. KOREA&CHINA&IRAN&RUSSIA
CAN & AT WILL CAN CRIPPLE USA 
WITH MINOR ACTION
WHERE IS THE IS???
There is NO honor admitting that you did something wrong when in fact you are perfectly innocent.
Lindsey Graham is FULL of himself!
THE PRESIDENT 
IS USING THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION ON THE TABLE, WAITING 4 ALL HANDS BACKING, NOT FROM THE CORRUPT, BUT FROM THE UNCORRUPTED
ALSO YOU NEED TO ELIMINATE THOSE CORRUPT DYNASTIC OFFICIALS THRU VOTES OR COURTS WHO ARE UNDERMINING REARMAMENT& CONVINCE THE CITIZENS !!!
ACCELERATING PRODUCTION ALL WEAPONS, RECRUITMENT, AND SEA-GOING SHIPS AND SUBS NOW NOT AFTER CONFLAGRATIONS,,
" BE PREPARED "
WE NEED OVERWHELMING MILITARY
ACTION AND ENOUGH STRENGTH TO 
ANNIHILATE,,    ALL THOSE EVIL EMPIRES,, AT ONCE, NO EASY TASK W/O
MAJOR LOSSES
AND ALLOWED OBAMA TO GET AWAY WITH GIVING BILLIONS TO IRAN, URANIUM TO RUSSIA, AND THE BENGAZI EVENT 2B FORGOTTEN,
WE NEED OVERWHELMING MIL
I AGREE WITH THIS TOTALLY!!
WHEN YOU ALLOWED THE DISARMING OF THE US MILITARY STRENGTH, AND ALLOWED TRAITORS  TO SELL SECRETS TO F/COUNTRIES
Less talk, more action. You have the power to start making things happen and you stand by. Shame on you.
Then, for our democracy's sake, please do something to stop the collusion between the WH and Russia.
What should our punishment be for meddling in Europe? What's good for the goose is good for the gander
Senator ~ PLEASE.  PUT ACTIONS WITH THESE WORDS. Lead with your Actions  LEAD YOUR FELLOW SENATORS.  ENOUGH.
You're hurting your reputation and the GOP reputation and America's reputation for not doing what is right and getting rid of this tool!!
He is hurting more than the presidency.
Thank you Senator. Now, what to do about it? Someone should put a bell on that cat said #theMouseThatDidNothing
8.
He's an idiot! Graham has been on Trump's ass since the primaries. Lindsey isn't America first, he's Graham first!
He DID bring it up. Lindsey wanted the entire meeting to be about 2016? Thank GOD Graham is NOT President. He doesn't understand history
Did you want President Trump to call Putin a liar "wrestle" Putin ? #MeetAndGreetG20
7. Example1.
One never shows their hand folks. U ALL may be use to OBAMA doing so. Trump is NOT OBAMA
6. How do I know beyond a shado of a doubt all this Russia was not created here by hackers? VPN, Spoofing, email servers hidden everywhere
What difference does it make. Election is over. Can't you republicans get with the program and get something done.
5. Try backing our President instead of bashing him. Support need to be seen and heard folks. We the people r sick of this!!
4. Rather have Russia as an allied than a damn enemy. Give Trump some damn credit here!!!!
You need to protect us and get that idiot out of office!
3. We never heard a big fuss on that! We r more worried about Health Care, tax reform, Economy. Why do u ALL avoid these issues with Russia
Give it a rest!! Can't move forward 4 this Country so long as u r on RUSSIA. Where was all the hoop la on Obam/ CLINTONS? She met n secret
You all are so damn quick to rush to judgement. How do u know what he has up his sleeve? It's time to move on folks & focus on home issues.
Then do something about it @LindseyGrahamSC . Otherwise you are an accomplice.
STOP TALKING AND DO SOMETHING!!! YOU'RE AN ELECTED OFFICIAL, YOU CAN ACTUALLY TAKE ACTION! But you don't care b/c he's making you a fortune.
U r a sick corrupt one fo sho.I think ur constituents must know more about YOU:  Check out @stranahan's Tweet:
How the American Establishment propaganda machine functions...test it out yourself... https://www.pscp.tv/w/bDE53DUxNzIyMzh8MWdxeHZianlyZFF4QgB6SjU2Ya8pX1KIFJf6iDxSOII03NeL3AQjd8U_eAnV â€¦
Yeah, what about those intelligence agencies that found evidence of WMD's?  Get off it & dump Obamacare. Or R U beholden to insurance cos?
GET YOUR BALLS ABOUT YOU @LindseyGrahamSC !!! GET. HIM. OUT. OF. THERE. and the rest of his den of thieves as well!!!
Big talk about Trump, then does nothing.Bull shiting on MSNBC that MITCH is working hard to save American Healthcare & the Dems won't help.
Where you been, @LindseyGrahamSC? Get in the goddamn game and do something! Like...let me think...um...#25thAmendmentNow #ImpeachTrump 
And yet the GOP will do absutley nothing about because Yay! They're finally in power.  #dipshits  #ImpeachTrumpNow
Russia did nothing no server was turned over to fbi or homeland security that is against the law.No proof or evidence to support this
I do declare! Then do something about it!! More action, less bitching.
Sen Graham needs to listen to other news outlets rather than CNN & MSNBC, other MSM networks.
Lindsey Graham is a shameless Rino
You didn't mind asking for @potus help before primaries & when he uniquely dismissed you you haven't gotten over it just like jeb @SCGOP
Stop referring to ISIS as 'ISIL'!!!!
Graham has interfered in the conservative movement his entire life!

Omg, @LinseyGrahamSC what did u expect POTUS to do, go into 1st mtg and punch Putin out? We need to work with Russia for peace!
OMG SHUTUP
Lol how did he work that one out 
Thank you for speaking up . We need our officials to step up and protect our country !
And he is deeply concerned... Again...#Complicit party over people
Now he plans to collaborate on "cybersecurity" with the people who did the hacking.  The question is what y'all are going to do about it?
No Dems and Rinos like u are trying to hurt him! We The People have POTUS six! We r watching and will vote u out! Count on it!
The Graham called Trump on his cell, and asked:  How did I do?  Is the check in the mail?
Anyone but hillary

Putin joked on camera at the #G20summit2017 about murdering journalists that hurt Trumps feelings. He didn't have to use the word murder 
Not much to hurt, is there?

And yet?? You do nothing,  your party does nothing. I mean f'king seriously, you all threatened to impeach Obama over passing ACA. So F.U.
What interference?  Still waiting for the PROOF.  Not bcuz u simply say so.
Watch for Special Counsel Muellers final report which will searingly illustrate all the spineless ways in which the GOP ceded decency&Law
Americans are sick of watching the Spineless GOP just stand there while around the World this is Reported .
Wow. A searing assessment of the President of the United States by political editor @CUhlmann of Australia's ABC. 
DONT YOU THINK ITS TIME TO DO SOMETHING BESIDES TALK ABOUT IT.  ITS TIME FOR THE GOP TO PUT COUNTRY BEFORE PARTY.  #CountryOverParty

Mnah, Mnah, Mnah.  Do something about it Lindsay. Lead the GOP in the Senate then I'll care.
Talk's cheap. U will earn credibility when you DO something to curb Rump, and stop voting for corruption EVERY TIME!
Lindsay is the job of the defense to stop the offense from scoring in a football game or the score will be 100 and nothing
Americans are depending upon Congress to stymie the outflowing of affection Trump has for Putin and it's destruction of American democracy.
will never happen.. until Mueller ends Trumps presidency. ThenGOP WILL RUSHin &pretend to take credit 4 saving Democracy
@POTUS did acknowledge it and he did so even before the #G20. Tell us honestly, have ANY other countries tried to hack us or only Russia?
Lindsey Graham - please do something about the idiot who sleeps in the WH!  It's up to you!  Make history the right way!
Ummmmm what about the FACT that obama knew & did nothing!?! What about that Lindsey?!?
Hey Lindsey why not move for Tax releases?  A full investigation?Impeachment?  Oh wait you don't really intend to act do you...
https://twitter.com/InsidersABC/status/883829926993862656 â€¦ @vp @SpeakerRyan @SenJohnMcCain @SenateMajLdr @SenatorBurr @SenTomCotton @TGowdySC @SenSchumer @NBCNews @CBSNews
What did we learn about @realDonaldTrump at this #G20? @CUhlmann explains. #Insiders 
Talk is cheap @LindseyGrahamSC.  Do something.
Hey, Lindsey. GOP can do something about it if they want to!  #cowards

He is hurting AMERICA!!!  It is up to YOU to DO something.
What the hell are you waiting for? Do something! He's giving our country away to that criminal you nominated. You own this!
Happy Birthday Lindsay! NOW is the time to pull Jared's security clearance and kick the Children out of the WH.
Trump acknowledged it...told Putin he didn't like it. Now what? Give Putin a timeout or a spanking?
understatement. 
In 9 yrs Russia has carried out cyberattacks on:
Estonia
Georgia
Ukraine
Lithuanian
Kazakhstan
Kyrgyzstan
US
Germany
France
Hurting our America you clown
No lindsey, you are.
He is hurting our nation, not just the office of the presidency.
BY NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT, YOU'RE COMPLICIT, SENATOR.
The senate needs to stand together against Trump when he is doing wrong things and his views of Putin are wrong.
Show us the evidence.  Aside from DNC dirty tricks & collusion with media, what EXACTLY did Russia do to interfer?  Put up or shut up.
Yes cannot believe hs starred that is WAS AN HONOR to meet with him.  This is why the Russia investigation continues.  It makes no sense
He is hurting America period.
Let's see Obama would say Islamic terrorist and Trump doesn't say Russians hacked . What difference at this point does it matter?HRC
Graham you still wanna keep beating that dead horse?? SPINELESS GOP POS!!!
shut up and leave. We have had enough of your babble on tv every Sunday! Embarrassing !
Senator, actions speak louder than words, so get this traitor out of the Whitehouse!!
Lindsay Graham should go to work for his constituents and stop grandstanding.
Big words, Lindsey. Back it up on the Hill. Put pressure on cowards Speaker Ryan and @PeteSessions to vote/ pass sanctions now!
He's not hurting his laughingstock of a presidency. He's destroying core values of our country. Words against him are not enough.
Lindsey , what's so wrong with your world ,that u would b so disrespectful 2 Potus. He beat U fair & square, ur pathetic actions will cost U
Big deal. All he does is talk talk talk
Hurting our democracy 
We're ruled by a #MoscowMidget
Enough is enough lock up the traitors in White House already
Putin: We didn't meddle, ask Trump.
Reporter: But WH hasn't released any info.
Putin laughs: We'll talk to the WH and tell them to fix that. 
Beyond the office, he harms our nation which has lost its position globally & jeopardizes stability of democracy. Do something.
The country.  His oath to protect our country. If only someone could do something!
Isn't it past time for the GOP members to call to #ImpeachTrump ? Seriously. Trying to spin his crimes and incompetence away is not working
Why aren't u vocal about FBI not investigating servers/devices? REAL investigative journalists kno that RU Did not hack.What's in this 4 u?
He not playing your Liberal Democratic games you clown. Everyone knows you vote with Democrats.
So what's the GOP plan Lindsey? Morning shows won't stop Trump Russia. He's killing your party
Lindsey- does it not bother u tht all Intel 4 RU claim is frm a false report y DNC's Crowdstrike? No concern r DNC/podesta refusal 2 handovr
@LindseyGrahamSC  then do something about it.  Don't just talk do something.
Hollow words. Both he & John McCain will say anything to get on tv and then they turn around and enable Trump/Putin
Happy Birthday Senator. Protect America. We are in crisis now.

What are you and the republicans going 2 do with trump since he has align with putin N destroying our country @sawsharee @solomongrundy6 smh
Sir, Pope Frances cares more about America than #Republican congress 
But what will you do,@LindseyGrahamSC? Enough talk. Ppl need to see actions. I do, I am a constituent and I vote.
America is slipping down as a world leader. Please reject Russia, our enemy, not friend.
What are going to do to protect our country @LindseyGrahamSC????  Talk is cheap. Stop choosing party over country and do something
Do something
And Lindsey Graham is a spineless worm who will complain on TV shows then do NOTHING. #ComplicitGOP #CountryOverParty
.@LindseyGrahamSC I hope b4 I watch this, you're talking about what congress has done b4 you come back to #SC. That's what I'd like 2 know.
You KNEW!  Now Stop this MADNESS.
@LindseyGrahamSC could actually DO something to help our country, but so far he puts the GOP over the USA. Shameful!
How about hurting our country? How about end of our democracy? When will GOP take stand against Trump authoritarianism?
Does the president have Alzheimers?  Because he's committed Treason and none of you seems to care.
@LindseyGrahamSC You know damn well that the Trump organization is in bed with the Russians evident to us why not you get head out of sand

Trump will feud with someone forever over a personal slight, but if you violate the nation's sovereignty, let's let bygones be bygones. https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/884013689736769536 â€¦
So damn sick of you "on again off again" republicans. Support our president or go the hell home! We stand firmly with @realDonaldTrump !
Mr Graham you stating there is no evidence of collusion (yet) shows that you do not care about this country. #SundayMorning
Destroying this country. You are complicit. @SenateGOP will not be forgiven or forgotten.
He's hurting the COUNTRY. I think asking Putin to work with him on cyber security takes this well beyond "failure to acknowledge."
We have three branches of government so each can act as a check & balance on the others. Stop simply complaining about POTUS & do something!
awww here's a tissue Linds. now, GO #DOSOMETHING or go cry in your own tea cup with the vapors.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT IT???!!!!!!!!
So what are you going to do about it @LindseyGrahamSC ?
The closer they get to the drain the louder they squeal.
Country before party! Maybe more will feel emboldened to start speaking out as well! 
#25thAmendmentNOW 
#TheResistance 
#Trumpcareless
No ines asking for that. He and others are asking the president to do two things: voice unequivocal condemnation and ...
... take action to prevent election meddling in the future. Oh 3 things; and punish Russia for meddling in 2016 via increased sanctions.
1. He, like trump, thought Hillary would win. 2. He found out in mid august, election was less than two months away...I don't think it's...
... troublesome that his responses took a couple months. Trumps been in office for six months, what's he done?
