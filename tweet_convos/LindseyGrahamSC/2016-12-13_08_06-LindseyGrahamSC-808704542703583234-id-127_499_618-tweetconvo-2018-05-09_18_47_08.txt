#GENOCIDE
that was his secret agenda, the revolution could not succeed
@HambySr @LindseyGrahamSC Guilty and disloyal to the Republican Party.  RINOs.
Too bad you and McCain were for funding the 'rebels' that are really TERRORIST killing #Christians #Syria
you can stop railing on Obama and focus on STOPPING Trump...who will destroy our nation!
Then the US, Qatar and Saudi shouldn't have destabilized it and given the Free Syrian Army types false hope.
How does this tweet help the residents of Aleppo?
this is his legacy doing nothing whilst the Russian government massacre the Syrians

An objective analysis of his whole ME policy pretty much demonstrates the unintended consequences of naivety.
Thank you for speaking up about #Aleppo
They never seem to have any answers. Just tout their ubiquitous "disaster" talk and play the blame game.
No. Vladimir Putin's has been a complete success.
Mr. Graham,our hearts are with you @itogenclik CNN  @fahribozgeyik27 @itokurumsal
and Trump's avid support for Russia will confirm genocide in Syria. What are you going to do?
Mr. Graham, our hearts are with you @itogenclik CNN  @fahribozgeyik27 @itokurumsal #ato
what do you think Trump will do? Putans friend, Assads friend too. Ha' we're  lucky Obama kept us safe.
its was his hidden agenda
well then Trump's cozying up to Putin is what we need. Is that what you're saying, luv?
You would have done nothing different.
@billpostmus please retire leave don't ever come back can't go to the RR without asking @SenJohnMcCain he should quit too
Exactly; "Never Again" a hollow promise: Syrians sacrificed for Iran/Russia like Czechs for Germany "Peace for our time"
What can be done now?  Something must be done. @marcorubio
you are a complete disaster too!
you need to WAKE UP
And Trump is in denial that Putin is a war criminal - double disaster.
Really? You take this as opportunity to attack the POTUS when your party blocked him in everything & got us Trump. Really
@meshaluk 
President Obama's Syria policy has been an agenda, he meant every single decision...
@aworldoftruth You're just as much of a disaster as Obama! Stop pretending, we all know you're a globalist shill!
#LeadingFromBehind #RedLinesInSand didn't work. Ppl of #Aleppo need our prayers. It's O's #FailureToMeetDueDillegence #tcot
Stop! You don't care.  You tore down Trump to try to get Hillary a win.  You VOTED FOR #Aleppo
This is a genocide happening before our eyes, not your chance to round up fans. Will you take action or complain?
From all I can tell the GOP(minus you and McCain) is about to throw a victory parade for Putin.
what about trumps? He heaped praise on   Putin. Putin is ultimately responsible not Obama but trumps thinks he's the best.
Disaster? You sound like Trump. Let's solve the problem then. Priority #1 needs to be Russian involvement at home.
. @LindseyGrahamSC Hmm, maybe allying with AQ & ISIS to foment civil war in Syria at the behest of the Saudis wasn't such a great idea.
As is all you neo-cons policy
Twittering?
Did you offer an alternative? What did you DO to prevent this? What are you doing now?
You are a disaster!!!!!
Not everything in life should be political.Either take a real stand or hold off on your fake tears. You're empowered use it
Sir, with due respect, you've not mobilized any senators to take action. You can easily do so as you're 1/50 who has power
We have all failed these civilians of Aleppo.  None of this is new. Awful.
To throw this all on the Obama administration conveniently absolves you and your party of any responsibility. Senator.
this is Russia's fault! You can't complain about #Aleppo and support #PutinsPuppet #shameful #TreasonousTrump
No thanks to you and McCain. Beyond disgraceful to feign sympathy w/ tears shed over your own gross actions.
Yea but GOP is in bed with Putin now!
I hope #USA is still to #SaveAleppo. but why they are keep watching while #Assad continue his massacres !!?
He wanted surgical strikes... what did you tell him again?
The neocons started this shit show in the Mid East. Whats the next country you mainiacs are planning to wreck? Iran??
armchair quarterback.
@JoyAnnReid @POTUS .Mr Graham, if you think we are failing NOW.. just wait til you see what the next admin will do.
#obama's inaction & huge concession 2 mullahs in Iran is a disastrous.he is fully responsible 4 such bloodbath in Syria!
#obama's inaction & huge concession2 #Iran'smullahs is a criminal policy he is fully responsible 4 such bloodbath in Syria!
What are YOU doing to help?  The GOP??????????????????????
to the muslim brotherhood it's probably quite successful.
what do u want?? US involvement in another middle East war?? No thanks
USA should withdraw its Syria offensive, a US/Israeli/Saudi policy to destabilize the region. They are completely to blame
the Senate has proven their power to halt presidential goals...don't stop now when it really matters!
America's headed towards a military state and environmental meltdown.  I hope you all care and take action.
I agree! Heartbreaking and horrifying!  But all twitter is talking about is Kanye West's meeting at Trump Tower.
You are so right. We need to bomb more. That is your solution to everything. You voted to create ISIS.
@kristina_wong 
Maybe Putin would halt if @realDonaldTrump asked him?

@DonaldJTrumpJr @IvankaTrump @SenatorSessions
I forget, what did Trump say about Assad? Oh, yes, that he's a great ldr. LOOK! IS #ALEPPO THE RESULT OF GREAT LEADERSHIP?
What woukd a fucking Republican do different? Suck up to Putin?
If you are heartbroken then do something about it. Please.
what would u do different? Enter war with Russia?
Trumps new BFF Putin is backing Assad.
Real leaders don't point fingers. They try to come up with solutions.
so sad and the world watches.  
stop tweeting and do something about it then!
to say nothing of Bush/Cheney's destabilizing of that entire region.
@ZKotek And your doing nothing Congress is to blame. Bunch of wussies who refused to battle Obama on anything. #TermLimits
Maybe if we just bombed Yemen some more...we'd all just feel a little better about ourselves...what do you say?
The GOP just elected a man who says killing the families of our enemies should be legalized.  That's what Assad is doing.
well just wait until your party's president teams up with assad and putin, buddy
Obama's legacy has been stained by this , the silence is deafening ! He's let Putin/Assad bomb and kill  . Shame on Obama .
i don't think @realDonaldTrump's policy of being bros with them will help
yep
Obama is trying to stop shit like this. You stood back and let it happen.
As Russia have played a significant role in this, I hope you throughly vet Trump cabinet nominees, particularly #Tillerson
where's the U.N.? This shouldn't be a USA issue alone.
Trump thinks he's so smart, but he has been out witted by Putin already! Wait and see!
The days of American freedoms are on a count down, get ready for WWlll, on American soil!
#Syria’s Opposition Prepares for the Next Phase: A Long-Term Insurgency
  http://mebriefing.com/?p=2638 
The President-Elect has the same position in Syria as Vladimir Putin.
Blame President Obama for everything just wait, China is already flying nuke jets over southern seas, for Trump!
At least President Obama didn't send my children to die in to fight on foreign soil FOR OIL!
maybe if republicans stepped up instead of blocking everything Obama put forward things would be different. Party first
exactly. What do you think trump will do? He will let his buddy Putin do whatever he wants.
Maybe Trump's relationship with Putin will lead to less dead Syrians.

Imagine this; Peace.
how?
Because Trump won't make grunting noises about toppling national leaders.
https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/801427933839630336 … @LindseyGrahamSC
Governor @NikkiHaley is a strong leader who will be an outstanding ambassador to the United Nations.
Why are we so selective as to what is shown on TV., the Iraqis were treated like shit! No food, no medical, no TV coverage.
You mean, Putin and Assad, right? And GOP's failure to allow Obama to act, right? And @realDonaldTrump will be much worse.
Why no images, no help, for Iraqi civilians who lost their homes and lives when we bombed the shit out of them March 23?
What would you say had the Russians invaded our shores during our civil war?
It's not a civil war in Syria.  It's a proxy war.  Who gives ISIS, al Qaeda, TOW missiles?
TY <3 PLS HELP #ALEPPO if theres anything u can do to SAVE THEM <3 :( *they NEED SAFE PASSAGE OUT*
well im NOT GIVING UP ;} <3 #ALEPPO NEEDS US!!
but not too heartbreaking to keep you from using it for a cheap political shot, huh?
ironic that @BarackObama is responsible for the deaths of more Muslims than anyone in history...
Hussain Obama must run for president of Iran in the next year. He is a walking disaster.
Don't you mean Putin & Assad's bombing policies? Obama pushed to do strikes. GOP blocked. Speak truth. It's time.
Wrong.  Obama has dug in his heels and is being pushed from behind by Graham, McCain to start WW3 already.
And Trump’s will be better when he’s skipping most of his briefings? Right. Got it.
You honestly think Trump's Syrian policy, if he even has one, will be better?
It is. How is the rest of the world standing by helplessly watching this?
@ezlusztig @jaketapper Global disaster? You ain't seen nothing yet. Not even a month and look at him.
Tell it to the Iraqis
true story
What alternative did you propose?
Focus on the #RussianHack! America is in peril!
Yes. But we should not think that Trump's intention of aligning with Russia in Syria is better. Both are wrong.
but thank you for acknowledging this
