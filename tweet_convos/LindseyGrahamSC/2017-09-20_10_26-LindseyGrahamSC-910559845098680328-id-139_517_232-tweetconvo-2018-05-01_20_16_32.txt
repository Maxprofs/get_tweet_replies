I hear its based on the one they use in Nambia, can’t seem to find the Nation
The Evil @SenateGOP led by the Hypocritical @SenateMajLdr is planning to kick 36 million off their healthcare & give the wealthy a tax break
Hey Lindsey - how much $$ will the Koch Bros stop giving to GOP campaigns if you don't repeal Obamacare? #sleazy #greedy #KochEmployee
Billions
No hearings.  No bipartisanship.  No transparency.  YOU ARE SELLING SNAKE OIL.  Disgusting @GOP.  Total Clan of Corruption.

Vote No #CassidyGraham
Outrage! This is not how to conduct important business of the United States Senate. @SenatorCollins #mepolitics.
Turtle man is going to pay for his treasonous dirty deeds so Eddie Munster and Pence!
Over 50 organizations oppose the Republican health insurance plan that will kick millions off of health care. Here are some of them.
Because...... Cheese... why Cheese? Because it makes as much sense as to us returning to the Dry well expecting water.
Every @SenateGOP who votes for this evil bill MUST BE KICKED OUT OF CONGRESS-they're pandering to corrupt Pres&rich donors-not for the ppl
@HouseGOP discuss @GOP MENGELE/@LindseyGrahamSC / @BillCassidy Healthcare Final Solution Bill, REPUBLICANS KILL MILLIONS, STEAL BILLIONS
@BillCassidy @SenateGOP
What Graham-Cassidy really is: trading our lives for #KochBros money
@UN #GrahamCassidyBill
THE DARKNESS KNOWN AS THE GOP...WILL BE HAPPY TO HELP THE KOCH SUCKERS...SICK AND EVIL...THE LOT OF THEM!

"He Lied to me"....and America!!
@GOP Will do anything for their tax cuts for the wealthy...this what its all about. Disgusting.
Talking points. How original
Well come on then genius,say something thought provoking...
I'll keep it simple for you...changing the tax code means everyone gets a tax cut. I win.
So we only have a few days to take a couple GOP Congressmen "fishing"?
Blue Cross warns GOP repeal bill 'undermines' pre-existing condition rules
IT'S TIME FOR AN AMERICAN REVOLUTION AND FORCE THE GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL AND AT NO COST!
Dear Mitch McConnell: How I feel reading this as a single women living paycheck to paycheck with an #autistic son and a #ADHD daughter......
You can add this bird
 
Some1 throw birdseed at McConnel, Paul Ryan, Graham & Cassidy & release pigeons everytime they leave a building !

LINDSEY GRAHAM CRACKERS HAS THE SAME PROBLEM AS MITCH MCCONNELL, THEY BOTH HAVE ALZHEIMER DISEASE BAD VERY BAD.
What's the zip code I should use??

REPUBLICAN THEORY IS NO HEALTH CARE ! EXCEPT FOR THE RICH AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL LOWER THE NATIONAL DEBT AND LOWER THE POPULATION.
KOCH BROTHERS ARE KOCH SUCKERS
McConnell is going to have his baseball game ruined like the Scalise guy!
And solidify their place in history as the #partyofkillers #gopmurderers
.@LindseyGrahamSC GOP&toxic hlthcare damned 2 repeat history-like Washington leadership during Viet Nam,they are willing 2 kill 2 have a Win
@PrincessBravato vote No, No , absolutely No!
F@ck @SenateMajLdr
That ought to be a cluster
That's like saying: We r going to carry out an execution next week.
If they offered a viable alternative to the ACA we'd support it. They want to hurt people who have preexisting conditions.
Stop them.  Bottle them up.  Fight the GOP and #Resist #ImpeachTrump Manafort sells is out to Russia and you do NOTHING!
Call ur Senators, RELENTLESSLY, voicing ur concerns. Apathy is failure 2R Democracy. By taking no action 'is an action of irresponsibility'
It was nice knowing you, McConnell. NOT!
Senate to vote next week and 85% of healthcare recipients vote in 2018 mid-term. How's your math working for you.
No real Americans want this bill. You will hurt families, is it worth it to you for an artificial win?
We all need to call, tell them NO
32 million people will lose coverage! Greedy old party should  be ashamed #SaveACA
Yesssssssssss!!!!
Let us see how these tribal GOP, anti-WtP, liars want to destroy the USA healthcare system with Dumb and Dumber:
GOP=Greedy Old Pricks
So you want to explain why want to kill my seven-year-old son? Or kill his parents and leave him an orphan.
C'mon little buddy, now is your time to shine. Go get him, tiger. #TeamGlioblastoma
@SenJohnMcCain
This is most shameful act--88% of Americans hate the GOP bill. This is not about health but about midterm elections. Disgraceful politicians
Yes Koch brothers are pushing this latest plan, threatening individual Republicans with  cutoff of campaign funds if Obamacare not repealed

The Graham-Cassidy bill is a harsher & a bigger economic disaster than recent failed bills. It will be devastating to smaller hospitals.
McConnell is a crook
VOTE NO
@LindseyGrahamSC Removing preexisting conditions for ALL Americans for KOCH $ is criminal! #DrainTheSwamp
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO PRESENT THIS HEINOUS HEALTHCARE BILL AS YOUR NAMESAKE#TrumpCareKills @POTUS @SenateGOP @HouseGOP #CorruptGOP 
ho hoho the koch brothers want their money back cause they said you suck at this.. @SpeakerRyan
ho hoho the koch brothers want their money back cause they said you suck at this.. @SpeakerRyan
Surely someone on your staff is bright enough to google "health care expenditures as a percentage of GDP" for you.
But I guess looting the ACA for a tax cut for rich people is the point for you, not actually solving the actual problem.
How does it feel, driving a stake into the heart of the middle class?
#ACA #contactyoursenators #norepealACA @LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy #badforamerica #riseupfolks #tellthemno @SenKamalaHarris @SenFeinstein
Hey, @SenToomey, don’t piss your pants with excitement running over to cast your vote in favor of this deplorable bill.
Maybe @SenToomey can hold another townhall w/65 tickets, submitted questions & have a citizen arrested again
#TheResistance
Taking care of our sick is 1 thing that separates us from the animals. We shouldn't just push them out of the nest to die.
@LindseyGrahamSC Only highly corrupt politicians would pass a bill so damaging to hard working Americans, for Koch $.
Americans need healthcare, not your personal agenda!
I thought Mitch didn't want ANOTHER EMBARRASSMENT
Disgraceful!
How is getting rid of lifetime caps & protections for pre-existing conditions better?
My cancer surviving husband will be uninsurable.
So will my 29yr old son. So unfair. People do not choose cancer or other aflictions...
Its a bluff,He doesnt have the votes..Bluffing
I have a pre-existing condition you're going to take away my health insurance I'm going to die

On Yom Kippur?
They should be ashamed
They should be arrested.

Disgusting PIG! 
(Sorry to slander the actual barnyard animals)
And good luck with that. Aren't soles of @GOP shoes melting already from standing at the Mouth of Hell?
Current GOP leadership is the worst, no ethics.
1/ There is no "he said/she said" on whether new version of Trumpcare ends protections for people with preexisting conditions.  It does.
Kelly it's the PELICAN POUCH CHIN McConnell who pushing for the HOPPER LONG CASSIDY BILL. AND THE OTHER IDIOT CRYAN RYAN

NEW: Blue Cross plans on Graham-Cassidy

Refutes everything Cassidy has been saying.

…
Americans says VOTE NO on thishealthcare bill!
@SenJohnMcCain @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @SenRandPauI
Shame on You for having Anything to do with this Bill !!!!  We need Medicare for all !!
Minimum care for all. Those who can afford more can!
The people that pay more will also being paying for the Medicare for all. No thanks
This is Fakenews. The @GOP didn't have nothing to do with Russia. This is all trump
What a shameful attempt by the GOP to murder hard working Americans by denying them healthcare. #healthcare
Man that's bull crap an you know it. Stop painting with a broad brush
The Graham Cassidy bill is already defeated in the matchless name of JESUS #GloryWagon
It's about time!
Heartless. People will die when they lose coverage and you are rejoicing?
Obumma care is a joke ! Stopping the freebies!
What freebies?
Duh
That really didn't answer my question.
Maybe you should know what you're talking about before commenting on things you know nothing about!
Hmm. Still not answering my question...
Streets, people. Phones and streets.
Undecideds, @robportman, @SenCapito, @SenJohnMcCain, @SenatorCollins, @lisamurkowski. And liars, @LindseyGrahamSC, @BillCassidy. #SaveACA
Much as I hate McConnell, he seems to understand the process. So he announced the vote just to lean on these guys? I guess that seems odd...
He announced a vote in July too. Bc he thinks he has the votes? Pressure from the Kochs or from @POTUS? I'm not giving up yet. #SaveACA
I guess--it just seems like he might have some weaselly knowledge we lack.
Maybe, maybe not. Maybe I'm making a difference by calling, or maybe I'm only saving my sanity, I'll keep doing it anyway.
#MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
Stunning

Katy Tur: there are no protections for essential health care benefits in Graham-Cassidy…
HYPOCRITICAL DOUCHEBAG!
Ironically, the non-solutions that the GOP comes up with are pushing the nation toward single-payer. Probably not what the GOP had in mind.
From your mouth to God/dess' ears!
#noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy #noGrahamCassidy
Ah shit. He wouldn't call a vote if he didn't have the numbers.
Not necessarily. It could be his way of trying to force Collins, Murkowski, McCain, Paul etc into a corner. Deprive them of time to study it
True but I don't see him taking a risk at an 0/2 on HC. This will end him if it doesn't pass. (Please let it not)
Will Mister Burns and Hannibal Lector be there?
McConnell repeatedly blocked healthcare bill for 9/11 first responders but let's this go to the floor. 
If they already had the votes, would they be voting sooner?
Yes..and Dems are set to Vote them all out in 18...and 2020!
This is nincompoopery for an intelligent  man as McConnell to revisit a bill that the many fought against.
Either McConnell has the votes to pass this travesty or he is trying to push wavering Rs to vote yes. Either way we need to stop this!

Grrrrrr
The "turtle" will never get any of the POTUS agenda done which is what he is doing!!

Bought and paid for.
Oh no. This means Murkowski and Collins have caved. How can they do this? Are they so desperate for money and power they don't care?
They haven't said yes or no
I hope it fails but if it passes its political suicide for the GOP
It's their worst effort yet.
Do not ask what good they do.
How can 32 million people lose coverage when ACA enrollment is about a third of that?
These snakes will get this bill passed. I knew it since day Trumpcare 2.0 failed in the senate. But there's always 2018.....
Senate to vote NO next week on #GrahamCassidy bill! 
Trust me, you or whoever "we" is has already shown #TeamKamala (@KamalaHarris) the tactics you'll use if she runs.  Thanks for the prep! 
No problem, she could put on a Make Amer Great Again hat and never win more than 5 states. Please we beg run her. You should be a Republican
I wonder who of Collins, Murk., McCain said yes
That means they think they have it
They definitely have 49
Paul is a no...it hinges on Murkowski and collins...again
