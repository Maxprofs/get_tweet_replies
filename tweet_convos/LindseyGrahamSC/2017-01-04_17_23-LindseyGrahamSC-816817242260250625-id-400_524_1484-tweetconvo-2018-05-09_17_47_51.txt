Graham: I hope Trump will get his info & trust the American patriots who work in the Intel community, and not some guy hiding from the law 
Sir, as a Democrat myself I have much respect for you. You and McCain have remained steadfast and unwavering. Thank you.
um meme true look it up and they are Republicans... ugh
You really mean: "I don't believe Americans should give a whole lot of credibility to anything I say."
Americans agree
Wilileaks, Assange, & Snowden need to be removed from Twitter.
We give Assange more credibility than we give you.
Assange is obviously a Kremlin stooge. Is there a way to pressure Ecuador to kick him out of their embassy?
@CNNSitRoom No, you dope; you're the idiot, along with the traitor, McCain.
So, is this your attempt to discredit in the event your misdeeds will be published in 2017? Looks like a CYA move to me.
@CNNSitRoom Grahamnesty lives in perpetual fear that his emails to the DNC and the Like will become public.
only ONE American did. Oh wait, he's going to be President
Assange is who the people listen to, not establishment liars like you and Obama and Hillary.
@Amanda_Clinton Trump is going to pardon Assange and Ed Snowden for their espionage against US b/c they helped elect him
Assange has no charges - just a witch hunt.
Not true.There's a reason he's been holed up in Ecuadorian embassy in London for last 6 yrs
There ar NO charges pending against Assange. https://justice4assange.com 
He has been charged w/ sexual assault in Sweden & is wanted by the US to be charged
you are incorrect. Charges were dismissed in Sweden. Look it up. U.S. conducting witch hunt.
stay on it Lindsey, our America needs you
for?
To provide a face for the globalist cabal, & a reminder of their hold on our government.
oh shit...
Pardon my language.
But you fucking nailed it!
Which email if false Lindsey? Corruption at all levels in Washington. Find it and eliminate it.
@CNNSitRoom ten years of Wikileaks truth has been more accurate than American fake news.
@CNNSitRoom Any credibility at all?
is that what you call yourself a patriot, dream on
Unlike you, he doesn't lie constantly.
DJT has and will favor Putin and Assange over American intel bcs they helped his election.  Please balance & counter DJT
@CNNSitRoom with all do respect wikileaks has more credibility than you Lindsey as far as consistency- who r u protecting?
@CNNSitRoom I don't believe you should continue as a US Senator....
says the fool.. neocon...
@CNNSitRoom Unfortunately, the man walking into the WH, not only agrees with Assange but flirts with Putin. DT is a traitor
Then why does Donald Trump??
but you think we should believe liars like you...Haha not
where was concern when China stole personnel files, Pentagon  &  initial DNC hack?  Why didn't DNC turn server to FBI,?
Early onset dementia has several subtle signs.  You demonstrate several.
@CNNSitRoom We're suppose to trust an Intelligence group that just leaked its report to NBC? Smells like politics to me.
#realDonaldTrump Trump is not American
i believe him more than a politician
Americans don't give a whole lot of credibility to anything a politician says.  That means you.
One more example of poor judgement
@LindseyGrahamSC @wikileaks @WLTaskForce
I don't believe any American should give a whole lot of credibility to anything Julian Assange says. https://twitter.com/CNNSitRoom/status/816685309618491396 …
@CNNSitRoom Sen. Graham hits nail on head, says what needs to be said: the obvious.
I don't believe a damn thing that you say Senator Graham! You've been useless!
what you believe doesn't enter into the fact that HILLARY LOST!!!! Get over it & quit blaming Russia, you RINOTURD.
give us an example when they have been wrong or anything leaked was incorrect????
@CNNSitRoom put your head in the sand...
the government has not been able to prove wiki leaks was http://wrong.You  sir are whats wrong with our country
so we should listen to Clapper who lied to congress about spying on Americans?
From Mr credible himself, @LindseyGrahamSC Buahahaha ha!!
@CNNSitRoom I've always followed the same policy as concerns anything you and CNN say.
@CNNSitRoom go play with your tinker toys Lindsey! You're a child
@CNNSitRoom I'm really sick of you!  We will replace you, when given the chance. #JeffDuncan #treygowdy
sadly we feel that way about ALL of you in Washington.....Sucks when whistleblower has more credibility, huh?
@king_kalpana @CNNSitRoom When I agree with Lindsey Graham #Bezzaroworld
@CNNSitRoom I can't believe South Carolinians put you in a Republican Senator seat. Clowns to the left....
@CNNSitRoom Getting tired of all YOU have to say!!
@CNNSitRoom And I don't think we should give credibility to anything you say!
good luck with that, your whole administration has been wrought with disingenuous subterfuge and corruption, go to prison!!
@CNNSitRoom Nothing Assange has revealed has been disputed! The media and politicians are not to be believed!
@CNNSitRoom I don't think most American People listen or trust anything you say.
if you can provide ONE EXAMPLE of wikileaks being wrong ill believe you. C'mon Lindsey put up or shut up
except wikileaks has never been wrong and Clapper has lied under oath and spied on US citizens...Shameful
You count among the things we voted against.
#DTS
sick of Grahamnesty and his BFF McCain, seriously, they hurt more than help. TERM LIMITS
UNITE to DEFEAT  DEMORAT  RINO @LindseyGrahamSC in  PRIMARY
SC can do better, we need allies, Trump is not the enemy of America-- the Left is.
&  RINOS like  @LindseyGrahamSC are our Political  ENEMIES
<-- Nobody should give YOU  ANY CREDIBILITY

You've been CONSISTENTLY WRONG for years
We shall soon see Trump's reaction after briefings. Great job today at the hearings. #StandwithGraham
I trust him a lot more than Clapper, who lied to your fucking face, Lindsey. You & John shld skip off into the sunset.
thank you for courage to stand up for truth, for all Americans, against Trump, against lies, for those who serve us well.
And Senator I Don't Think Americans Should 
Give ANY Credibility To Anything You Say. Your a Self-Serving
Political Hack.
Oh you are still here? Thx Hmm...thought you were gone already.  You look kind of expired
Lindsey! Do you remember when the Russians battled in netanyahu's election?
@CNNSitRoom i dont believe this is how you want to start the new year. @wikileaks is the only reason you have a voice.#MAGA
@CNNSitRoom Coming from someone with ZERO credibility, this is laughable. Why should anyone trust you?
Why Did DNC Refuse FBI Access to Servers???...
Thanks for having the gonads Senator. We are proud of you for your standing up for us. Haters will hate, ignore them.
@CNNSitRoom friend or foe we haven't caught them lying yet. Clapper has been caught & Smart people wait for evidence
@CNNSitRoom Fake News..Hoaxers
you're a fool if you trust anything that comes out of any govt agency under obama
When you have more liberals thanking you maybe it's a sign you're in the wrong party.
@CNNSitRoom You are the one Americans should not give credibility to!
@CNNSitRoom where've u been for the past 10 yrs? Why now? You fools have been there way to long and done nothing
@CNNSitRoom  L. Graham U& McCain R the ones I mistrust especially after today's Fake hearing u set up w/ur Dem buddies.
Thank you for siding with America it does help to know...
I don't believe that any American should give a whole lot of credibility to the main stream media
You, McCain, Flake, etc. have no clue that America isn't buying what your selling any longer Graham. Buy a clue.....
@CNNSitRoom mr graham you believe most of the lies you pumpkin out?
@CNNSitRoom 
We already KNOW not to give a good damn about what either you or fellow PROG @JohnMcCain say, buttwipe
Good Lawd almighty Graham. I trust Assange's posting of the facts. It's a hell of a lot more accurate than you or MSM Momo.
What has Wikileaks ever reported that was not true? <crickets....crickets....crickets> @realDonaldTrump @Michael2014abc
People don't want to hear #truth because it may #expose them!#exposeaway
@CNNSitRoosays Russia not  involved in hacking DNC.dem's  have to blame someone for loosing. Can't wait for President Trump
@WLTaskForce @CNNSitRoom or, you don't have credibility because I can't see proof. Dont shoot the messenger.
@CNNSitRoom whatever he is; nothing he has Exposed can be denied. We give criminals witness protection in this country
@CNNSitRoom He hasn't been wrong or lied yet. Can you say the same?
maybe it's time wikiLeaks to take a look in your closet. I'm sure there's a skeleton or ten. 
CIA - eliminate cur.culture inside agency. Important to understand Islam; more important not to 'be' Islamic.
What? Are you really so naïve? In my profession this is a mental disorder, transference.
@CNNSitRoom Lindsey,You just don't get it. You are the one America does not trust anymore. You love your power more than US
@CNNSitRoom - GO AWAY LINDSAY GRAHAM YOU ARE A DISGRACE TO AMERICA!
@CNNSitRoom Unfortunately, that would mean giving him as much credibility as we give you.
With all due respect you don't know what you're talking about Sir. The info published by WikiLeaks has open the eyes of the American people.
You are a patriot who puts country before party.
I don't believe any American should give ANY credibility to anything Lindsey Graham says.
Except for that whole accuracy thing you're right.
@CNNSitRoom I'll take the word of intelligence agencies over that of Assange (& Trump) any day!!
NO CREDIBILITY WHAT SO EVER. NONE.
@CNNSitRoom I appreciate the hope but given past behavior I don't think we will see decency, competency or patriotism
he has put out facts and you attack him for doing so
@CNNSitRoom  What does that say about your incoming Commander-in-Tweet that he treats this enemy of state w/ such respect?
Agreed. However, we better be prepared if we are to trigger an all out cyber war, because that's what we will get.
Most Countries HACK, for INTELL,to extent possible.

This is NOTHING  NEW.

Obama Hacked ALLIED LEADERS
can you please be sure an investigation into trump & team  to determine why there is so much russia influence manafort etc
Better than Muslim influence..
Assange has 100% reporting accuracy. Funny how both sides of the isle hate what they can't control
who has ?? Besides the Media of course....
@CNNSitRoom Thank you, sir.
.@LindseyGrahamSC We the people stand with our President Elect& appreciate fact he is taking a measured approach to Russia-we need proof!
Y'all have been exposed.. Trump is right! After 9/11 and Iraq.. We will never trust what our government Intel says
@CNNSitRoom pls keep the pressure on. Thank you!
@CNNSitRoom WE LOVE ASSANGE HES OUR GOD ON EARTH BY TELLING US THE TRUTH THANK YOU
@CNNSitRoom BHO also swore allegiance to CONSTITUTION. Did not mean much did it?
Bullshit, WikiLeaks gave the U.S. more truthful information that the government has in years. Speaks volumes.
OBAMA is Hiding from the LAW
You and John McCaine are dinosaurs. Your Globalist neocon nonsense will join communism in the dust bin of history.
More likely you will see DJT shirtless with Putin horseback riding; but suspect Donnie afraid of horses
For exposing bullshit that this countrys corrupted politicians are doing or may do? Gets the people digging. Snowden..HERO!
@WLTaskForce @CNNSitRoom No American should give any credibility to anything @LindseyGrahamSC says.
@CNNSitRoom at least Assange thinks I deserve a lawyer. #NDAA
I dont give any credibility to anything Trump says; Republicans are going to pay for this ~
@CNNSitRoom Then why did you accept and use the info from Podesta's hacked email account?
quand je vois ta tronche, je suis content de mon fion !
pétri de suffisance et bouffi d'arrogance 
 @SarahCrutcher2
@CNNSitRoom yes he should trust Obama appointed people just as much as we trust CNN
...trump will tell the russians/putin all of Americans secrets. ..GRAHAM PLEASE KEEP AN EYE ON TRUMP
@CNNSitRoom it's why you are on CNN with its 30 viewers
@CNNSitRoom I don't believe any American gives a shit about what you and lame brain McCain think
@CNNSitRoom Nothing that Assange has leaked has been said to be false information! Can you say the same?
did you find anything flawed in his leaks?
YES folks, this from a Jackass from SC who use to be my senator,by the way Lindsey who would trust a guy witha girls name
Him really wants to be a girl...
- same goes for you.
never thought I would see a day when Russia would own a us president, sad
@CNNSitRoom keep going on CNN see how that works out for u
We do not think America should vote for another neocon like you. Show us the evidence neocon war monger.
Neocon war mongering Lindsey. Why don't you tell us how nukes will go off if you do not get your way! You silly brat!
American voters can't wait to DUPE you out!
i think its time for you to retire
Treason!
It's scary @realDonaldTrump takes the word of Putin/Assange who R focused on dismantling our democracy over our Intel Comm!
@CNNSitRoom stay strong for citizens. Few republicans are taking a stand for what is right!
@CNNSitRoom please keep your eyes open and courage. There are a lot of people backing you.
@neil_lister @CNNSitRoom Your party is responsible for this. YOUR SPINELESSNESS ENABLED THIS.
you are not fooling anyone anymore. you are a dinosaur time to retire. New Goals New Paradigm. you just don't get it.
@rugratfarm @CNNSitRoom U need to tell ur GOP peeps cuz the rest of us don't! Plus Hands OFF Medicare and SS
Wrong - you are the enemy -tried have WWIII with Russia. You are deranged. He saved us from HRC fate worse than death!
Very apropos

Hillary being Elected WOULD have been like being raped.
@Colodemvoter @CNNSitRoom Doesn't look like that's an option, Sen. You elected a conman who is uninterested in patriots.
who is this Lindsey? This used to be called treason
@e391615r Senator, I have not been a fan of yours but you have my utmost respect for your position re: Assange and DJT.
I totally agree with your comment. Well said!!
@CNNSitRoom dear mr graham
ahahahah We don't trust the damn government or government intel - really?
@WLTaskForce @CNNSitRoom says Lindsey Graham who has even less credibility.
@WLTaskForce   I don't  give Lindsey Graham any credibility  either.
FBI, CIA, etc. have been infiltrated with Marxists. They'll lie, cheat, steal and sell their own mother to promote agendas!
@KarmaKittySays @CNNSitRoom oh whatever your always talking to CNN I hope you get voted out next time
Did you also buy into the lie about WMD's that caused the deaths of thousands upon thousands of innocents?
Wasn't the CIA pushing that lie.
@WLTaskForce  should not give any credibility to war hawk like him who did not keep his word in his sign  pledge.
