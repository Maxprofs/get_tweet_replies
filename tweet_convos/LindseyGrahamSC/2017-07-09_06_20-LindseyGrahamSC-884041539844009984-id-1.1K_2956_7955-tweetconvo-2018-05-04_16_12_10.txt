His presidency???  WTF? This is about the COUNTRY. Not trump. What the hell is wrong with these people?
I'm literally screaming this. He's dumbfounded?! No, Sir, we're dumbfounded that the GOP sits and speaks anout the woes and does nothing.
I'm with ya , literally screaming this. I'm getting so angry at the GOP ! It's totally obvious that they care about their party NOT this cou
It's gonna bite 'em in the butt. That doesn't break me. What does break me is all the havoc being wrought in the meantime.
Exactly!!  Every morning, my first thought is, what will Trump do today, to our country!
And sadly, your thoughts can't even dig that deep in the gutter of humanity to come up w/ the right answer b/c you're not a craven human.
Good point Kendra.  It's hard to even think like that.
He's not "hurting his presidency" he's trying to destroy America.
He's doing it openly and with malice since he clearly hates this nation.
No, Obama clearly hates this nation. He has no respect, as Bush did for him.
Lol. Obama isn't POTUS.
He is behaving as if he still is. Going to Germany showed how classless he really is.
Lol. I recommend that you pay attention.
I said "shoo" and got blocked 
The Trumpsters act so tough, but block people constantly. Guess they need their safe place
.@LindseyGrahamSC - you know it was NEVER about his presidency. Just his wallet. #rosneft & #tRump laundered   corrupted all y'all.
Reminder for .@LindseyGrahamSC
If u think this is still @ a presidency ur very mistaken.This is about our country & democracy. Why are u refusing to take action? Guilty?
How much Dirty Money did Graham get?
#FollowTheMoney
Let's find out. This may start the search:
Maybe he's going to be implicated in this investigation eventually...
HOLY CRAP!!!  http://ir.net/news/politics/125885/exclusive-trumprussia-expands-gop-senator-congressmen-possibly-implicated/ …
Do you lefty conspiracy theorists have a treehouse somewhere where you meet and concoct all this insanity?
Are u ok with the arrangements being made between Trump and Putin on cyber security?
He is also hurting America.  When is one Republican going to actually care enough to do something.  What other evidence is out there...
It's really butt hurt Lindsey Graham and pandering fools like @SenJohnMcCain that are hurting our country.
#MTP
We want Obamacare repealed by a simple majority in the Senate the same way it was passed by the Democrats. Get it done damn it
@LindseyGrahamSC so nut up, Lindsey. @POTUS and fam are traitors. @gop needs to do right thing or history won't be kind.
And spineless.  Lindsey Graham is also spineless.  He's already rolled over for Trump in exchange for getting policy and funding he wants.
Did anyone say that to Nixon about the China policy?? Support @POTUS #MAGA
He didn't get into the White House being a neocon, in fact that's what he defeated along the way.
The GOP is hurting ordinary people, our lives & our country.
not 'his' presidency @LindseyGrahamSC  / OUR presidency - and you are going home too
Too late. Graham knew this all along.  Graham is complicit. Our president has handed over the keys to Russia. And the @GOP let him.

He is hurting the nation.  He never should have been president. If any of you actually cared about our nation, you would have nixed it.
I really wish you cared more about "our country" than "his presidency".  Frankly sir, that dumbfounds and disappoints me.
#gopComplicit
I'm Hoping !McCain gets through surgery well. Trump said get well soon but then said "we need your vote". Deplorable!!
Then do something about it?
The left now loves the war mongering establishment. Don't forget... I won't.
Uranium 1
It's not his presidency we're concerned about, @SenGraham2016. It's the nation.
He's hurting America!His Presidency was always fake, and fuck ed up.The only thing missing is the gift wrap & bow for Putins friendship gift
No, he is hurting the United States and the American people and you Republicans are doing nothing about it.

.@MSNBC cuts Lindsey Graham's audio after referring to the Clinton campaign meeting with Russians. 
@SenJohnMcCain so Lindsey & Johnny have an illegal arms factory named Arsenal in Bulgaria.  #RepealGraham&McCain
His presidency??  What about the rest of us???
what about the devastation he has already done to this country?
Brilliant!  Trump's partnering with Russia intelligence will give us an inside look at their spy techniques. What could go wrong?
He doesn't have a presidentcy. And I'm not disappointed. He's performing right up to my expectations.
"His presidency"???!! I don't give a FLIP what he's doing to his presidency. He's hurting the COUNTRY!
@LindseyGrahamSC PLEASE do something !!!

@LindseyGrahamSC then do something!
Right @LindseyGrahamSC @SenateGOP @HouseGOP have done virtually NOTHING on the #trumprussia front. WHY? The silence is disturbing
They want his signature. Nothing more. They know they have a buffoon/stooge in place.
So true!
Lindsay Scarlett has lost all credibility.  He and McCain have done nothing but enable the hostile takeover of America.
Exactly nothing. Their Tweets are moronic and useless.
"I'm so worried about the State Dept." -@LindseyGrahamSC. If you're "brave" enough to say 45 is this bad, then act! #MTP #25thAmendment

GFY!
#FOLLOWHISEGO Admitting Putin meddled in election suggests Trump didn't win fairly. Because of that he believes Putin over FBI,CIA, NSA. Wow
@LindseyGrahamSC @speakerryan @SenJohnMcCain @senmarcorubio #TrumpQuisling All Hat. No Cattle.
Gee if only Lindsey Graham had a job in congress that would allow him to Do something!!
@LindseyGrahamSC  all talk all the time- find some   even if they're someone elses and DO something other than talk! @FoxNews
And by extension an entire nation.
SC knows Lindsey will continue to bow to the con man-
No Lindsay, he is hurting the country.
Lindsey likes to give lip service on Sunday shows...then does nothing.  For awhile I thought he would step up...not happening.
Means nothing if he doesn't say it's hurting our country ...
He has no presidency.
His lower lip will quiver as he votes for the next Trump initiative.
dumbfounded? Totally predictable to those paying attention
Can Donald hurt his presidency more than he already has?
How low can you go...
@LindseyGrahamSC Get a spine. #Trump is hurting the country. And you and your GOP are enabling. #25thAmendmentNow
And the rest of this extended clan of grifters can go to jail.
I am dumbfounded, that Lindsey Graham and John McCain keep getting re-elected.  Both are terrible human beings.
LINDSEY CAN BE DUMBFOUNDED & DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THE PRESIDENCY,BUT THE PRESIDENCY IS NOT WHAT HE'S DEALING WITH! LINDSEY IT'S "DICTATORSHIP"
I am dumbfounded that articles of impeachment aren't being voted on already.
Dumbfounded is a good word I'm pissed off our country was attacked , invaded by another country I'm pissed at both dems and reps for it
Were you as dumbfounded when President Reagan negotiated with The USSR and Gorbachev? The Swamp luvs you and Mccain #MondayMotivation
Screw his presidency - he's hurting our country @LindseyGrahamSC. Do something!
@LindseyGrahamSC Hurting HIS PRESIDENCY! How about ruining America & it's reputation and destroying the PLANET??
He forgot to add "Y'all"! #GolfClap #Rebuke
He's hurting more than just "his presidency". He's throwing out Democracy with the bath water.
Really?
@SoSofieFatale he's hurting the COUNTRY, Senator.
And then he will vote the party line, no matter the consequences for the country.
Duh!! Now what?!!! It's time for you to act!!! Country over party – now! Otherwise you will be just as tainted!

I wonder what Senators Feinstein and Grassley had learned at this point. This was March 15th, are we caught up w/ them?
He is a southern jackass.
Gop is sealing their fate by being pussys that theyll ever have a job in politics again once their time runs out.
Hurting? How about the country. Destroying, maybe.
Damn "his presidency." Be more concerned about his damage to the country. #countrybeforeparty
@LindseyGrahamSC still butt hurt @POTUS crushed him in primarys! Go join HRC in the woods! #MAGA
He's not dumbfounded enough to do anything. He remains on the sidelines, dumbassed
Yes, he is. However, that's not what's important. What's important is:  He's hurting this country, dammit!
His presidency? What about OUR country! @POTUS must be removed from office

Please...he's NO president
Hurting his presidency? @LindseyGrahamSC  if that's all you can say, then say nothing. Hurting his presidency? It's the country.
@LindseyGrahamSC he's hurting this country. When are you going to take ACTION?!!
Lindsey, no one is hurting Trump's presidency, but GOP cucks. Stop cucking. No one but the MSM and neocons cares about Russia. 
@LindseyGrahamSC NO. 45's hurting the country, defying ethics, and disregarding the Constitution.
To say nothing of how much he has damaging the country and her standing in the world! His morals could fill a thimble...maybe!
He's hurting the country.
It's brilliant, MSM is so stupid
Hasn't @LindseyGrahamSC been dumbfounded since @realDonaldTrump gave out his cell phone number?
Graham speaks as if this hasn't been happening since day-F*ckin-one. Helloooooo....did you just wake up from a catatonic stupor???
Trump doesn't care. He never wanted to be president, he just wanted attention. Daddy issues.
To hell with his Presidency.. Our country!!
Says the jealous 3 time loser.
We do not know what went on between our President and Putin. We should all hold judgements.
Graham can cut his flowery fuckery. Trump's hurting the USA--& been hurting it since DAY1

Graham's ENABLING him.
Sen Graham may get vapors if that rapscallion DJT continues not to behave like a gentleman
He actually thought trump cared about his legacy? Or this country? He is an international swindler with a love of himself &  #ImpeachTrump
Hey Lindsey, he is hurting our COUNTRY! We have not had a POTUS since he started. Told to sign x, golf, told to say y, golf, tweet, golf
@LindseyGrahamSC how about hurting our country and killing our democracy?!
@LindseyGrahamSC he is hurting America. The @GOP has got to do something & stand up for our country! Enough already!
He had us at "...I am dumb ..."
@LindseyGrahamSC more worried about Trump's feelings & hurting his presidency than American people-how scared we are and losing democracy.
Yeah. Concerned. Alarmed. Troubled. Disappointed. When the f*ck is he going to actually do something?
Only disappointed?  The rest of us are appalled and disgusted!
@LindseyGrahamSC TRUMP SHOULD LOSE HIS PRESIDENCY
I think you should lose his freedom but I would be satisfied if his presidency Only were lost for now.
That ship sailed the moment he was sworn in and Graham knows it.
If only HIS presidency was the only thing he was hurting instead of the whole country. 
He is hurting all of us. The United States of America! His presidency is a farce!
@LindseyGrahamSC is like @SenJohnMcCain. They're major sore butts. They talk the talk but sit the fence. Must hurt like sh_t by now.
So harsh from the Girl Scout where are your saggy nuts Graham in you dam shoes ???
Waiting on all the MAGA patriots to denounce him as befits the MAGA theme.
Goddammit @LindseyGrahamSC , he's hurting more than his presidency.
@LindseyGrahamSC "He's hurting his presidency." 

He's hurting our country Senator Graham and you're doing nothing to stop it. #25thThe45th
REALLY Lindsey not hurts USA but his precedencyplease sit down
...he is hurting his presidency AND OUR COUNTRY @LindseyGrahamSC  !! Walk your talk.
Doesn't matter about Graham's stance; 99% of the time he's taking up for Trump or he's too busy trying to be the cutesie court jester of GOP
Graham continued, "yeah, but what are you gonna do?" and proceeded to vote to take healthcare from tens of millions and other monstrosities.
Tired of the bullshit from Graham and McCain, they speak but don't act. A true patriot would have hair on fire, but McCain does nothing
And our country?
Russia annexed the US on 11/9 with the help (willing?) of the tRump family & slimy associates just looking to make $. Totally treasonous.
Fuck that, dt is hurting the country. Graham should be using Steiner language & not dance around this.
Hurting HIS presidency? How about hurting THE presidency!
U should be proud the lib journalists love ur attacks on @realDonaldTrump guess why ur interviewed for ur anti Trump rhetoric. U think?????
Every time he Tweets, every time he speaks, every time he takes an action he hurts his Presidency.
But you can bet he won't vote against them.
Any support whatever that you give to @realdonaldtrump is #treason. Your interview on Meet the Press reveals your GOP commitment only.
He also says that Russian interference did not affect the election. That is bogus. No one knows how it impacted.
He's hurting America!  He's hurting every single citizen!
Agree!
NOT TO MENTION THE COUNTRY!
Poor Lindsey. I hope he's not going to have a vapor, bless his 
You're just figuring this out @LindseyGrahamSC ? Don't think so. You're a hypocrite.
Doesn't any of the GOP realize that the one that finally takes a stand against this idiot and honestly work to end this mess will be a hero?
He's not just hurting his presidency, he's hurting our country, he's hurting the world ffs! Please end this nightmare!
@LindseyGrahamSC We're way past the point where it's possible to 'hurt' this presidency. Your party needs to step up and put the U.S. 1st!
In the next era the Hillary people and the Ghaham   people will be in the same party
ONCE again lindsey stabbs the prez in the back and hurts his own party WOW what  a friend SA DAT TO BE REPUBICAN
Graham ran for president and didn't make it very far. His thoughts are real important on the man that beat him.
It's more than just disappointing, it's a national security issue and if you do nothing about it, it's a dereliction of duty.
I'll go one further.  The simple fact that Donald Trump is our President is hurting the presidency.
Such powerful words have never been spoken.
What would Lindsey know about being president? He should realize he had the lowest number of supporters to run...maybe he should take a cue
Not just his presidency...
F... K his presidency, he is hurting our country. Get him the Hell out of there.
It's not "his presidency".  This is about his betrayal of our entire country, and the republicans are his accomplices.
AAAduh I think he is also hurting you Lindsey and the GOP party.  Heads up!
Lindsey, if you're retweeting this left wing hack you might as well join the Democrat party
You really love the Sunday morning shows u know the ones Mussolini2 says are fake. There is evidence of collusion and it did affect Election
You are not dumbfounded enough,  or you would have done something about it,why don't you really your GOP Buddies kick his ass out of office?
Choice of words is telling "hurting his presidency". Party-centric. He's destroying the Country.
@LindseyGrahamSC We don't believe you Lindsey Graham.  You do nothing to stop any of it.
@LindseyGrahamSC Well leave it2U2speak the reality. U know he wants 2
2dismantle Obamacare because he needs the $$ 4 his other programs.
The Decline and Fall of America as the leader of the free world?
No Lindsey, he is hurt the citizens of this country!
Duh
Disappointed I get. Dumbfounded? Senator Graham is not dumb. I don't see how he can be dumbfounded.
This is the first time I can say that Lindsey Graham has tied on a pair and spoke the truth. Proud of this man today.
@LindseyGrahamSC Time for @GOP to stand up to Trump.  Talk is not enough.
Spoken by the thug who wants war with Russia along with his leftist buddies.
Graham full of platitudes when microphone or camera near but no action, just talk. Keeping up appearances.
@LindseyGrahamSC was talking to Trump not America in that interview. So was @SenJohnMcCain that is the only way they can talk to him.
He may be hurting his presidency but there are apparently no consequences
@LindseyGrahamSC @RepAdamSchiff Republicans got Putin in our country next Putin takes US over as he intended w/ his puppets help u promoted
At what point do you find your backbone and stop towing this party line of lunacy?
He is hurting the USA
"I totally didn't see this coming, despite the many signs and indications that Trump was Putin's puppet. Is my face red. BTW, I support him.
Sorry about the presidency, but he's hurting the world as a whole. Disregarding our climate, taking away rights and rules that help others.
-omg. Who in the hell pays attention to Lindsay Graham anymore-pathetic!!!
He is ending his presidency.
@LindseyGrahamSC All y'a do is talk Since 1-20 trumps/Kushners have been enriching using the Wh they have cost us $$$ impeach already
Hurting Presidency??  What about the damage to our Democracy ?? Disappointed?dumbfounded? Who cares?StopTake action!
Then do something, @LindseyGrahamSC
If only there were a solution to this quandry #25thAmendmentNow
Lindsey it not about his presidency it's about our country - our democracy - and you are complicit!!!
And Lindsey Graham ran for president and won? Oh wait!
The heck w/his presidency. He's hurting the country and democracy.
Even Lindsey, huh? So impeach. Or invoke #25A. Canine Mutiny his ass before he starts mumbling about strawberries & fondling ball bearings.
@LindseyGrahamSC I live in YOUR DISTRICT and am telling you to step up! What more will it take?  He's defiling our country at every turn.
And with everything he does!
He is "dumb foundered" and yet he will do absolutely nothing!
Remember Lindsey, Trump released your cell # during the primary campaign, but it's all about the party now. All profile no courage.
Be disappointed enough to impeach him. This is real. This is happening. Act now. This is a freaking train wreck. #25thThe45th
@LindseyGrahamSC talks the talk sometimes, but never ever walks the walk.
