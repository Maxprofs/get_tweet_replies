@LindseyGrahamSC did you forget that you wouldn't even give a nominee a vote??
Dems get all bent put of shape when things don't go their way
He started rolling a year ago, when the senate refused to grant a highly qualified, mainstream judge one single hearing.
"I'm not going to be a part of a Senate where Ds get their Supreme Court Justice and Rs never get theirs" WTF are you thinking? #Garland
You disgust me, hypocrite. Merrick Garland was a qualified nominee and you traitors wouldn't even give him a hearing. I am so ashamed of you
@LindseyGrahamSC   You're one of the few R's I like but Dems didn't get theirs your party unjustly blocked Garland, shameful
Hamilton rolled over 2016,when u denied Obama's nominee a HEARING!HYPOCRISY!Add 2 that Gorsuch nominated by 1st POTUS under FBI INVESTIG!
18 followers. Heh
Again, when is Merrick Garland getting a hearing, hypocrite??
Hamilton had virtually nothing to do with writing the Constitution. Gave one monarchist speech, NY lost quorum, said didn't like result.
@LindseyGrahamSC both parties stop the childish dick waving contest & govern as founding fathers intended you're pissing us off
Who was president when Scalia died? #DemForce #resist #TheResistance #RESISTANCE @MSNBC #MAGA
Lindzzzzzzzey Grahmnesty
Kamala Harris sd Gorsuch follows the law, not his heart. This statement defines liberalism perfectly. It also defines criminal behavior!
Incredibly disingenuous when you caused this situation by denying a hearing for Garland. It makes your statement particularly appalling, Sir
At your lies and phony patriotism supporting a treasonous party and administration?  Putin is pleased and thankful.
You sound like @realDonaldTrump with the alt. reality about Ds getting their picks but not Rs. Merrick Garland ring a bell? U did this.
@LindseyGrahamSC if senate republicans want to put the process back on track they can always give Merit Garland a up/down vote
Aw isn't that shame..when people start dying because the doctors won't take Medicare for those over 65. Then you start looking for a new job
Hamilton maybe rolling over but its because republicans are willing to support russia & dismiss collusion puttin party b4 country Disgusting
Propaganda
Only about Trump being President and McConnell as head of Congress!
@LindseyGrahamSC unless M. Garland gets a vote republicans are just playing games and not serious in lamenting of partisanship
Dems are betraying the USA
Hamilton wouldn't like an Alinski tell in WH
no he is not...if you don't have 60 move on Do right not politics. SCOTUS is too important. Maybe Gorsuch will step down 4 right
Hypocrite.  What @SenateMajLdr did to Garland was ridiculous.  You are a hypocrite because you know Trump is illegitimate.
Thank You Senator Lindsey Graham . Not often I agree with you.  This time I'm 100% behind you on Gorsuch Nomination.
They probably are, but at your and @SenateMajLdr 's attempts to undermine democratic principles. Merrick Garland, Senator. We won't forget
@LindseyGrahamSC He's rolling over in his grave because @SenateGOP and @SenateMajLdr disrespected #MerrickGarland #StolenSeat.
You're ridiculous Lindsey. Washington Times? C'mon. That's embarrassing. Not even a more then yellow press trash fire that you're retweeting
@LindseyGrahamSC besides....he sings very good too
@LindseyGrahamSC Hamilton believed in fighting for one's beliefs...will never stop fighting right wing extremists...
-> Dick.
.@LindseyGrahamSC Have you, sir, at long last, no sense of irony? #Garland
If Grouch doesn't receive 60 votes then need new Nominee not a chg of rules..We haven't forgotten Merrick Garland We are watching & We Vote
Senator Graham is highly principled and a blessing to South Carolina.
Pretty sure he has been on rotisserie since around January 20th
@lindsey @SenTedCruz Sen Cruz, Sen Graham, unless you forgot @GOP instituted the first ever blockade of a SCOTUS nominee last year.
Oh my Gosh is Lindsey growing a pair? Holy shit.
Wow, he is finally standing with Republicans.
Senator, I'm a lifelong Republican and ask that you remember the shameful treatment of Judge Garland when you speak. Alex rolling then too!
For Merrick Garland
Shut up sir
Garland!
Correct, when Obama won the white house he had the ability to appoint who he wanted.
TURTLE  HEAD BLOCKED OBAMAS PICK.  Sad !
And what was he doing while you blocked Obama's appointment for ELEVEN MONTHS, wouldn't even meet with him or have a vote on him. #JOKES
Not it is not, it is about finding the best person and Gorsuch is not the man
You didn't even offer Garland a SMILE, only disrespect. Payback after 8 yrs of obstruction- sleep tight. 2018 CLEAN OUT ALL GOP/DEMS
WASHINGTON, ADAMS AND JEFFERSON ARE ROLLING OVER IN THEIR GRAVES AND ARE DISGUSTED WITH EVERY LAST ONE OF YOU CONGRESSIONAL MEMBERS!!!
I doubt it...
Never seen anything so despicable, such a disgrace to our constitution, our rights, the very foundation of America!  Go back beginning laws.
GOP to loose SENATE in 2018,if nominate Gorsuch by breaking rules to confirm him. What an incentive will that be to DEMS to VOTE midterm!
Stolen SCOTUS Seat
YOU CAUSED THIS. YOU CANNOT BE BIPARTISAN. GOP HAS MADE A MESS OF THIS GOVERNMENT.
Yeah cause u support trump hope u get thrown out of office
Nuclear
They've been rolling, where the hell have you been Lindsey?
Judge Garland. 'Nuff said.
"The Graham Rule" requires 60 votes to confirm SCOTUS nominees. You'd think the creator of it would know the rule?
They did under Obama now getting back
Yeah likes of you will do that.
@LindseyGrahamSC mitch mcconnell and GOP obstruction have brought this about. They play only dirty pool. Dishonest. No integrity
...be great to have a Judge who doesn't fall asleep on the job - and a fair and honest one at that!
I doubt Hamilton would have been proud of your treatment of Merrick Garland, either.
AGREE!
You are wrong, Senator
Such theatrics!
@LindseyGrahamSC Garland
Really. What was he doing when you wouldn't even give Garland a hearing. Lying hypocrites.
One of Hamilton's biggest fears was emoluments, but no foreign influence on this President. Oh wait...
Merrick Garland Sen Graham. Yet u feel its ok for a President who is under FBI investigation to name a Supreme Ct Justice. Gutless hypocrite
On nuclear option "I'm not going to be part of a Senate where Democrats get their judges but Republicans don't get theirs".  #freeMGarland
Yes. The Democrats certainly got their judge last year. Thanks for protecting those poor little hypocrite republicans.
Thanks for the enlightenment Goober.
You blocked a vote last year on Garland & change rules for your guy this year. What hypocrisy. Can't win so change rules. Repubs will regret
This will give DEMS so much energy to REGAIN control SENATE in 2018!!! they will regret deeply! War in ON!
Always the senates drama queen.
THANK YOU @JohnKennedyLA and all senators who stood up & spoke just now.
No. Hamilton is not rolling over.  Get a grip, Senator.
@LindseyGrahamSC Arron burr?..
?Why because Gorsuch  believes in the constitution? Or are you offended by his need to follow the law?  How noval
THANK YOU! @LindseyGrahamSC , @MikeCrapo , @ThomTillis , @tedcruz , @ChuckGrassley , @OrrinHatch , @JohnCornyn , @SenMikeLee , @BenSasse
Hamilton rolled over when the Electoral College didn't stop Trump.
Screw all this bullshit talk. Just use the Nuclear option (or as the government people call it the nucular)
@LindseyGrahamSC  you outrageous hypocrite. What about Garland?
Obama isn't president.
Hamilton was rolling over four months ago!
he rolled over since the @GOP held the seat hostage. merrick garland means nothing today but did for the @GOP.
Dems only want someone that supports their agenda not the Constitution.
Bingo!
I bet he did not like how the @GOP handled Merrick Garland.
Funny. He went full Zombie apocalypse when GOP implied a President is not President in his last year.
@LindseyGrahamSC Hamilton rolled over in his grave when the Elector's placed a Russian Traitor in our White House.
Aaron Burr, who killed Hamilton in a duel, created the filibuster! Learn your history my friend!!
@LindseyGrahamSC HORSESH!T is not what it's all about. Spare us your baldfaced LIES. Pres. Obama nominated GARLAND and you lied.
Senate coup by lindsey graham because he didnt get his way. Filibusters Obama's tenure but throws hissy fit now@LindseyGrahamSC @SenSanders
R u kidding?   Merrick Garland?!  Hypocrites!
@HouseGOP Hijacking the SCOTUS is bullshit. Our senators were going with what the constituents wanted. I will work hard for your opponent!
I just walked past the Trinity Church Cemetery. No disturbance @LindseyGrahamSC
If you go nuke and lose the WH and Senate in 2020 - Dems will have open field for appointments on SC, plan carefully :-)
This seat was STOLEN!!! You're good with being part of a GOP that has to cheat to win?
The libs put in 2 seats ????Remember
You do know how it works Mary? President in power at the time of an opening makes the appointment. Scalia should have waited 300 days to die
He's been rolling for a while
Most of the Founding Fathers are likely dizzy from rolling over in their graves the past few months.
@LindseyGrahamSC #merrickgarland ,you sound hypocritucal af
Oh my friend Hamilton jumped out of his grave and pulled his proverbial hair out over what the GOP did about Garland.
Ummm Hamilton rolled over in his grave when the Garland seat was stolen. 
not only that seat but all the rest that come up in the next eight years
#Merrick #Garland deserved better...
YES!
