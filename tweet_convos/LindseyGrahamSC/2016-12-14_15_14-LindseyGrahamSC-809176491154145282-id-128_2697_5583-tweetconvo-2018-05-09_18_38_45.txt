we r in unchartered waters if I agree with Lindsey Graham Damn Trump he is screwing my head up!
Last week I was agreeing with Ann Coulter. I know. I still feel dirty. 
@Phil_Mattingly @BraddJaffy
Yikes! Now that's scary.
I know our world is so screwed up now
Two years ago, my @DeptofDefense records, w/ 2000 others, were hacked. That includes my restricted (classified) records. No Media attn then.
The @DeptofDefense gave me 3 years of Security 'monitoring'. I now employ two Security firms to secure my home/family, & an identity not me.
trump #NotmyPresident is the one that is crooked. he STILL HASN'T RELEASED HIS TAXES! Electors vote for HRC for President!
Please  Electors vote for Hillary Clinton for President of the United States of America! America is counting on You all!
What does that Breitbart guy weigh anyway?
Fits the description ....
@Awaken_the_46 Who is being considered for a cabinet post.
Me thinks DJT is just a little obsessive about weight.. accept his own, unless a reporter jabs him about it hummmm
I'm waiting for the reporter who has the cojones to him why he's obviously gained so much weight.
Of course it would also take serious balls.. because DJT would ultimately discredit! Media scares him

Who knew old Lindsay had some wit.
He's had some good ones on Donald during this campaign.  He was funny!
I'm not a fan of his either but have to give him credit for putting country first!
@LindseyGrahamSC I agree.  Please investigate with independant source
Graham has some wrong-headed ideas politically, but he has a good sense of humor.
We should all thank whoever did the hack. Provided more info on how corrupt Dems were for voters. Need more info, not less
@sallykohn @JTheTrueBelievr
Don't we, as a country, have enough to worry about without Graham fat-shaming Russian cyber-thugs?
@LindseyGrahamSC  what I like about Lindsey:what you see is what you get.And WITH a sense of humor.And this from me:lib Dem!
heust have met the hacker.
BAMM!!!
Is no one going to stand up for the athletic black hats getting a bad name?

@terri_georgia Loaded With Money Fights Tigers...
Lindsey Graham needs to move to Democrat. He's despicable not deplorable. @LindseyGrahamSC #godemalready
Agree Completely, same for John McCain big #RINO, who should make honest man of himself @Dab7One @LindseyGrahamSC
@marcylauren  You said it Lindsey

The way Trump said it, the guy didn't weigh 400 lbs., the bed weighed 400 lbs.
@mharvey816 other wise we're the stupid crazy ones crying over a Hillary loss that is what trump keeps telling his slaves
@mharvey816 trump already has his slaves by their brains deceive someone into believing anything they will and anyone says
@mharvey816 if Donald Trump said it was Hillary the trumptrolls would all agree with him because of their blind devotion
Chris Christie is Russian?
But in this case it was a 145 pound guy who gave the ok. Big feather in his cap 4 undermining American election!
@Franield 
Finally owning the Truth! 400lb Russian Hacked America! Getting there Republicans!
lol but so sad
Oh snap! 
So, how many of the 46% of nonvoters actually voted but were erased during the hack?
Lindsay Graham is fucking killing it lately. Love when he gets all 'gloves off' (hockey style) & aint afraid 2 talk shit! 
As Dem I dont agree w/ Graham's stance on many policies. But respect his candor & courage 2 not always buy in2 partisian BS.
@IrisPABQ no...400# jersey guy..then he got the boot.  And a Kristy Kreme.
@JoyAnnReid 
Makes me think Trump was aware of the hacking.
@ZaibatsuNews
Lindsey needs to retire. He is washed up. How many runs for POTUS?  3 or 4?
So true.
oh...SNAP!
Gee, gotta say I *never* thot I'd get a crush on Lindsey Graham, but that's cruel & cool.
Everyone read US gov re Electors/etc. Too important not to read 1st hand.
Damn you, Lindsey Graham, for making me like this and you! #MadMadWorld
coulda been Svetlana
The Dukes/APT 29, is a highly disciplined, sophisticated & adaptive group w/ Russian state sponsorship, not some fat guy.
The 2 Donalds on The Electoral College.

@AmendArticle2
Right!? No conviction, no integrity.. His stance is always 100% bias & self-serving on everything.
@CourtPencil 
Lindsey Graham And John McCain Are Both Old Creatures Of The Swamp To Drain
Send Em Home!
But they aren't liars like Trump, who is not exactly young either.
But they aren't liars likes Trump is? Who Marilyn are "They"
What are we~
You Speaking/ Texting Of?
No.
LOL!!!
A 400 lb. Putin employee.
lSad Joe and Mika are in denial that Trump is in debt to Russia that is why the defense. More is coming out.
It was Putin himself http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/putin-personally-involved-hacking-us-election-intelligence-sources-donald-trump-a7476331.html …
and DT knows his name
@FranSiegel Graham has continued to say what he thinks about T- with considerable wit-
if nothing else Sen Graham has the best sense of humor,
Plus some backbone, to boot. Can't agree w him much of the time, but he is honest - a rarity in DC. . . .
@JoeNBC 
@JoeNBC Lindsey is a has been him and McCain should ride off in the sunset together
Are they sure it wasn't a comet pizza employee?
We don't give a shit. If it takes the Russians or whoever to bring transparency back to The People. Too Corrupt.
If Russia (and allegedly Putin personally) was involved in the hack, our sovereignty is at stake --
--and our electoral process is compromised. You're okay with that just because your guy won?
And you talk about transparency - is blocking press access how you define transparency?
@JoeNBC Lindsey graham sounds like an 80 year old woman
Trump sounds like a 70 year old liar.
He really has quite a sense of humor...
@JoeNBC Lindsay Graham probably knows a lot of 400 pound 'Russian guys'. Oops! 
.@Phil_Mattingly #Trump's comments that I heard did not include reference to a 400 lb person. 
#ElectionHacking
A 400 pound Russian guy on the same payroll as Trump and Manafort, @LindseyGrahamSC
@AKimCampbell Trump conspired w/Russia 2 open the door -US sanctions closed to his dirty dollars in 2014. Watch 2nd debate.
Aww, that's wrong, Graham stole that from me! Since he's against Trump, right now, I'll forgive him. LOL
He's got to be one of the funniest guys in Washington.
Mrs. Lieberman wld know, just as he did the Iraq WMD! Shrillest #neoconnutcase except for Cheney
I'm really starting to warm to Lindsey Graham.
@thehighsign Lindsey, you have earned some redemption. 
@thehighsign don't mince words.  "It was Russia."
.@Phil_Mattingly @maggieNYT LIBERAL REPORTERS & ELITIST ESTABLISHMENT REP IN SELF-DESTRUCTION MODE**REMEMBER THIS
https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/790262564320120832 …
@LindseyGrahamSC ... so true
@PeggyBrava owned
@JWGOP why the fat shaming?
How does Lindsey know it wasn't Christie?
God bless 'im.
@RobbinSimmons7 have not heard to much on the news that Detroit had more votes than voters. This could be big
@JeffreyGoldberg 400 lb Russian guy who ate Putin
@byrdinator .....sitting on a bed
@sspencer_smb I think Americans want peace in general. Hence support for Obama's Russian reset and Trump's Big reset lol
I think Lindsay Graham is more politically aligned with Hillary Clinton than he is with Donald Trump to state the obvious
@JeffreyGoldberg 
@JeffreyGoldberg @LindseyGrahamSC Stay on it, Sen. Graham. Thank you!
@JeffreyGoldberg American citizens had made a choice by voting for @realDonaldTrump without any interference of Russia.
That’s why all the Muslims voted for Trump ? lol You're almost as funny as Graham
@blakehounshell First he said a 400 pound guy sitting on his bed! Then he said someone in NJ. Chris Christie bahahs
Sitting on his постель
.@Phil_Mattingly :D
@MrDane1982  now that's funny!
so that's why he had the meeting with all the tech giants?
That was good!
VERY WELL SAID!!
Gotta give credit where credit is due for a zinger like that. Well said, sir. *tips self*
@TeddyDavisCNN Anyone who help start Arab Spring should keep their mouths shut! They have NO credibility.
@MrJamesonNeat his new Bestest buddy 400 pound hacker a living in Trump tower with more chins than Trump
@MrJamesonNeat personal friend of trumps probably living in Trump tower
Sometimes Sen Graham is very, very funny-
Lindsey is a born comedian, missed his calling in politics where nothing is funny. Would have also make a better Democrat.

@ShellyPass Trump has lunch with 400 lb Russian guy, weekly. In bed.
And under #Putin 's orders...
#VintageGraham
@katherinemiller which kind of makes it worse tbh

@Bencjacobs but he won't admit hacks helped Trump win. Thinks Trump will support Russian sanctions. Dreamer. Never happen
Maybe. Russians showed Trump @LindseyGrahamSC campaign emails and he was angered and then publicized LG cell #
Yeah..Lindsay Graham is a noted cyber expert.  When will you guys start spreading the Lindsay's a homo" rumors again?
 Went right over Wolf Blitzer's head!
@Bencjacobs He is a funny dude.
