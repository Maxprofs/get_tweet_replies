You're the best Lindsey Graham!!!!!!!
Are you going to defend your best friend @SenJohnMcCain or not???? You're an embarrassment and a coward.
I m sitting here watching the Pres further divide and destroy this country-pls do something
Listen I am a #Clemson nut..all the way..right down the road..
Glad your having the a good time while Jekyll and Hyde @realDonaldTrump destroys our Country and the Republican Party #PresidentLoco
Perhaps you could use this experience to explain what "team" means to #45
Speaking of defending, how do you chastise Trump one week & praise him on foreign policy the next? Big disappointment, Lindsay!
Hope you watched trumps rant last night. He must be removed. His ability to pardon must be taken away from him. He is harming 
Good to see a former Gamecock in Clemson orange!!
What can I do for you..just ask..I have backed you from the beginning..and McCain...Go Clemson..
Well senator? What the heck are you going to do with #POTUS ? He is actually #certifiable
Hey, cool tweet @LindseyGrahamSC! Question: do you honestly consider yourself a patriot? Nah, we get it. It's all about the $$$, right?
How do you like Trump today, after he dissed your BFF, McCain? Are you back to sort of kind of disappointed or are you still good?
John 1:14
And the #Word became #flesh and #dwelt among us, and we beheld His #glory, the #glory as of the only [1/2]
#begotten of the #Father, full of #grace and #truth. [2/2]
Psalm 37:39
But the #salvation of the #righteous is from the #Lord; He is their #strength in the #time of #trouble.
"AMEN!"
Repeal and Replace
Lean anything about teamwork?
I cant remember if I called you a coward yet today? But just in case, you are a coward.
Can't help POTUS pass Healthcare, Tax reform or Keep our Country safe but U have plenty of Time 2 visit Clemson's football team. Priorities!
Time to do your job..Back the President..He is learning..I know your power..help out..please.

Senator Graham please do all of America a favor and resign from the Senate.There is no place for people like you in the new G.O.P.
Glad you're having fun on your vacation. Meanwhile, back in the real world, another $1500 dollar check sent to OCare for family of two
You heard him.   Are you all crazy too???  Do something about his mental incompetence.
Lindsey, how much longer are you going to allow this nutjob to wreck our country? We need heros. Pls be one of them. #CountryOverParty
You watching POTUS? How long are you going to tolerate him targeting people with hateful ideology ?
Not "defending". ATTACKING.



So glad you're out having fun!  You must have an entire wardrobe of those shirts by now.  Those colors look good on you!
 how does it feel when your boss publicly shames you and you cannot do one thing about it?
Ok, so that's really cool, but could you please #ImpeachTrumpNOW
another thing my father served in ww2 worked every day of his life when he died 5 years ago he didnt take a vacation, he took care of mom .
they were married 63 years and now i look after her with no help from the government!
ill be glad for term limits
But not one town hall. Nothing but photo ops for the career politician.
Guess since Graham cannot get anything done in Congress he thought the next best thing to do is see how The Champs ran their show!!
At least there are a few perks for the relatively thankless job you have. Good for you!
It's good to see you have so much free time, since health care and tax reform have passed.
Get health care reformed or we will put coach Batson on you!!! You'll need better health care.
Do you think he's cute? Great couple! #bromancingthebone
Love it!!!! 2 of my faves!!!!

I will always love my Tigers, but...
I just heard from a Tiger today. Your team and mine, Ohio State, have much to look forward to #soon. Good luck this season.
Go Tigers!
sure wish i could do nothing for 7 months then get a nice vacation
Why aren't you out protecting Fort Sumpter from destruction by John McCain and his democrat friends the antifa?
Go Tigers!
Whoo GO CLEMSON TIGERS
You are always out and about having a good time doing you plan on getting anything done for the people other than yourself???
@realDonaldTrump just landed in #AZ Just out of curiosity, is your mouth missing his ass yet???
Did Dabo blame his 28 career losses on Tommy Bowden? Probably not. He knows his success is measured only in his wins, not others. LEARN
Your buddy mccain, flake, az mayor refuse to attend trump rally. Are you insulted like we are??????

Gosh it would be a great gesture if the gentleman from South Carolina helped a disabled elderly fella from NV get tickets for a Clemson game
I hope Graham didn't see any of the game plans. He will blab them all over @CNN
Between this and the guns  picture, you're making it hard for this liberal not to like you. Give Dabo a hug from us Bama fans

just one more perk of being a senator from sc
Glad you're having fun, as your state is last in education.
Did you get to shower with the team?
You may be able to redeem yourself some by voting YES on the RAISE Act. It's what the Trumpsters want!
You are a Trumpian sell out Lindsey graham.
Hi Linsey, looks like you are having having lots of fun and influence on keeping rooted in what really matters. I appreciate you.

Gloater but a deserved proud one!
You and I are USC grads but as a US senator, you represent all SC folks.  Proud of you for supporting all SC schools.
Florida state Florida state Florida state
A well deserved break from politics :)

Just saw some of the Vice doc you were in recently. The rise of the Tea Party was " backlash over gov overreach"? GOP is so full of . 
Trump is not the only one trying to gaslight the American people. You have a part in this malignant presidency and climate inflicted on US.
Own up to it, read the Constitution, and do your duty.
