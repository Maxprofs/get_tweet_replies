Proud to have @SenDeanHeller join me and @LindseyGrahamSC as a cosponsor of the Graham-Cassidy Amendment. "Graham-Cassidy-Heller"
@SenateGOP @GOP @SenMajLdr #KillTheBillDontKillUs #KillTheBillDontKillUs #KillTheBillDontKillUs #KillTheBillDontKillUs #TheResistance

You're unintelligent if you think the Trumpcare is going to be better than tweaking Obamacare, or a Medicare for all healthcare plan.
Obamacare is dying,  no one with a working  brain cell wants government  controlling their healthcare. Maybe you enjoy gov. crumbs, not I
It big business that controls out healthcare, government just helps them along.
Government is behind the insurance companies rising costs,  gov. no longer wants just a piece of the pie, they want the whole pie. Why??
Government waste of tax payer money should be the first indication that they have NO business in our health care!
What's the point, if you vote Yes on Skinny Repeal?  The House will pass that piece of garbage.  Is that the legacy you want?
I wish I could trust you!
Your actions on Mueller, shows your true colors!!
American Patriots will campaign against your re-election, this will NOT be forgotten!
American patriots stand with Mueller, not Trump.
From a NY liberal rag .. OK 
Would that opinion be from the same rags who said Hillary was winning the election??  NYmag+no credibility 
Bipartisan - it takes all of us working together. Thank you Senator Graham.
Why Senator Graham is the GOP allowing Trump to disrupt the Whitehouse and spend more money to rehash Hillary Clinton? Stop this maddness
No version of repeal is acceptable. This #TrojanHorse bill is no exception. VOTE "NO" ON #OBAMACARE REPEAL.
Great - any democrats supporting it?  Please work on bipartisan solutions!
Oh give me a break. This is a garbage bill that no one has read. And democrats were excluded. Party over country.
NEW WE SABOTAGE ACA SOME MORE & CONTINUE THE REPUBLICAN SABOTAGE OF AMERICAN HEALTHCARE!
Obama took care of the sabotage years ago Obamacare sucks
@TGowdySC #TGowdyForSenate2020


I'm not sure why but I read that as "co conspirator"...weird, huh?
As long as it doesn't get tired up in committee too long. Oh how you guys in congress love the sound of your own voices. Get it done
Then get on to tax reform, infrastructer, & the wall !!!!
And you'll wait for a report from CBO and the Parliamentarian before the Senate votes on it, right?
SHAME ON YOU FOR TAKING LIFE SAVING ACA FROM AMERICANS
Gawd, you lie so much.  Obamacare is collapsing because of GOP sabotage. Be a proud gay man.  Stop lying.
RINO.  You will be voted out
16% approval
Let's see it.
Why vote no on saving expansion and healthcare for disabilities then? Confused.
please don't send "skinny repeal" to committee. congress doesn't care about us. please don't sell us everyday people out!!!
Obamacare light. Going to be hell to pay come Nov 2020 in SC. SENATOR TREY GOWDY!

@LindseyGrahamSC Thank you for protecting justice! I can't say it enough, thank you sir, thank you!
You ppl are disgusting
Yeah, so how do you expect this Amendment to fit into this fiasco?
Nice since Heller will not be there much longer. His vote on healthcare is going to defeat him. #goodriddance
THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY IF YOU ALL KEEP TRYING TO DRAG OUR PRES. THRU THE MUDD.DO YOUR DAMN JOB&PUT HILLARY,LYNCH&OBAMA UNDER OATH!!
With those names attached, it must be a truly regressive piece of legislation.
Wish I could be marginally excited about anything you propose, but all GOP bills are shit...dangerous and irresponsible.
MUELLER AND THE CLINTON MOB WILL NEVER OVERTURN OUR VOTES.WE PUT TRUMP INTO OFFICE&HE IS THERE TO STAY.WE THE PEOPLE WILL DEFEND POTUS
MUELLER NEEDS 2STEP DOWN DUE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.COMEY?.HE IS THE CONFLICT&MUELLER IS PACKING HIS TEAM WITH ONLY HILLARY SUPPORTERS
THERE WAS ZERO EVIDENCE 2SUPPORT A SPECIAL COUNSEL.HILLARY DESERVES http://THAT.YOU  REPUBLICAN SENATORS DONT DO A DAMN THING 2 HELP
Why don't you understand that over 80% of the American People want the ACA fixed, not repealed. They see you all as liars, cheats, thieves!
THERE IS GOING TO BE HELL TO PAY FOR SETTING UP OUR PRESIDENT&TRYING TO IMPEACH HIM FOR ZERO CRIMES.WE THE PEOPLE WILL MAKE SURE OF THAT!
You are a do nothing RHINO! YOU WILL BE VOTED OUT!!
