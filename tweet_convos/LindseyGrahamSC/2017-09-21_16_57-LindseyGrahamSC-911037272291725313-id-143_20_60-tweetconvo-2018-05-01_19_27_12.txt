It's a shame he didn't take the time to speak to those outside who wanted to talk with him. He ran from them. @LindseyGrahamSC #voteout
He met with the DACA kids afterwards from what I've read.
I saw the photo. He needs to spend his energy getting the #dreamersact passed and leave health care to the experts.
He believes in this healthcare approach. He is also for the Dreamers.  He's his own guy.
He's taken campaign donations from the Koch Bros. He's an owned man.
No way. He's quite irreverent, and often in trouble with the GOP. Do you not follow the talk radio weirdos? Hes got a flipphone ffs.
You are failing to acknowledge who he is behold to. At one time, I had respect for him. That's long gone. He's far from independent
As I said earlier, everyone's free to have an opinion. My opinion, LG's an independently minded trad con who does tons in FP & is bipartisan
This is an honest, good article.
States shouldn't have the right to kill people by pricing out healthcare.

You said you would walk away from any corn husker additions. What is Montana and Alaska medicare perks? Your move....we're listening.
@LindseyGrahamSC  Sir, Do you really think we believe the lie that Republicans are pushing?  I won't vote for you again. #healthcare
The curtains in the background look like the backside of a burlesque dancer about to go on stage into the blinding lights of the theatre.
Won't work:
He is pathetic!  SC Will not give us shit!  Policy over Americans!!!! He needs to be replaced!!
If this bill passes, Sen Graham's past service will be forgotten.  He will forever be remembered for the people who die with no healthcare
@LindseyGrahamSC just not sure if the block grant approach is cost effective.
How about a permanent Stop! End, finish, bury. Stop!
Who cares..Graham u have turned into nothing but a LIAR ...FOR DONOR DOLLARS....u have hung 38 Million Americans out a window in a hurricane

@LindseyGrahamSC will be responsible for countless deaths! I no longer have any respect for him & his evil cohorts! Despicable GOP plan!!! 
To this day, this day, I can't understand what leads you to do this. You seemed more reasonable. Respectable. I'm disappointed.

Since 2010, 82 rural hospitals closed in states w/ no Medicaid expansion. Repeal could close up to 700 in next 10yrs

I want to take hot on his chest.
EVERY major healthcare group is against this bill. Graham is responding to his big donors at the expense of the American people. SICK!
the 4 states you mention getting all the money, CA, NY, MD & MA, are who fully embraced the ACA and it's WORKING!
Sen Graham, ur threat of Sanders Sgl-payer bill is nonsense. Accept defeat of R&R, do ur job getting back to bipartisan improvements 2 ACA.
You don't want single payer 'cuz it's "socialism," but you had no problem with a Stalinist in the White House?
To my non-friend Lindsey Graham, why are you promoting a bill that will hurt so many folks? Please don't knock them out of insurance.
History is watching,SHAME ON YOU! Asking your good friend who is fighting for his life to turn on his people in AZ! Unconscionable
These are lies. Everything the GOP does is lies. They are working for the Koch brothers, not the people.
OUTRAGED !!!If its not good enough for all the states its not good enough for ANY of the states. SC didn't expand Medicaid - are we exempt?

Man as terrible as SC is w fixing the roads, I'm sure they will just ace healthcare!

#BREAKING: All 50 Medicaid directors come out against GOP bill to repeal ObamaCare http://hill.cm/h25skCt  
Sadly you can afford to say this bc your constituents pay for your excellent health care.  How can you put party over what is best for ALL?
We will. Thank you. When companies leave SC to come to a state where they don't have resources drained by healthcare costs, you'll own it.

Statement from @AmerMedicalAssn: "...the Graham-Cassidy Amendment violates the precept of “first do no harm.”
Lindsay your health bill is awful,it stinks, everyone hates it.what an ugly way to solidify your legacy..stealing people healthcare.evildoer
The AMA is against this bill. Does that not tell you all you need to know! #SaveACA #fixACA
OMG! You are trying to bribe @lisamurkowski? What are you doing?? This has got to stop now! Please!!! #SavetheACA #fixACA
@SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC Please vote against this Bill. I wonder if POTUS, McConnell and Ryan put Graham up to this.
Please don't do this my whole family has pre existing conditions. You can not be proud your name is on the bill. Millions will die reality.
Medicare for all is the best way to go!  Just think of the "peace of mind" generated that would increase productivity. God Bless America!
Medicare for all is the best way to go!  Except, it would put many healthcare insurance companies out of business, & cut thousands of jobs.
He is despicable.
Medicare for all is the best way to go!  6) A 6% medicare tax will be cheaper than an ave. premium $3852-$9996/yr + up to $8000 deductible.
Medicare for all is the best way to go!  5) Providers will be able to file claims with one health care payer that reduces overhead...
Medicare for all is the best way to go.  4) Patients will have more choice & universal coverage across the country....
Medicare is the best way to go! 3) Medical cost will be spread over one pool of 326M patients.  Overhead will be cut to 3-4%.  ...
Medicare for all is the best way to go.  2) Malpractice insurance will become limited because the medical costs involved will be covered...
Medicare for all is the best way to go. 1) It replaces employer based HC making U.S. business more profitable & competitive globally! ....
@LindseyGrahamSC I thought you were one of the good guys. I will do whatever I can to get you unseated in next election.
You picked one hell of a hill to die on,Graham.this is rotten legislation and political poison.
@LindseyGrahamSC if you cared about all Americans as much as you care about winning, we might be getting somewhere.
Flippy Floppy Graham trying to be a conservative what a laugh...
Dog whistle for the selfish. GOP governors oppose the bill, it just benefits the rich (and Alaska - What a coincidence!).

What is wrong with you?  Obama care is working!  You are EVIL for taking that away.
Did you tell them you are a Koch brothers employee.
@LindseyGrahamSC do not think you can fool God or country! This "City on a Hill" made it through Nixon, we will make it through u & trump!
States like mine, WV, and many others have an historically poor record taking care of their citizens, so no I don't trust the states.
We are the United States, not the let's do 50 different things states. All Americans deserve same rights and care, not what state says.
Look the giant bigot is telling lies again. He will do anything to get the black guy’s name off the healthcare. Just FIX the ACA !!!
Hate to break it to you, but you don't have any friends in California.
Take your cruel, shitty "healthcare" bill and shove it. #GrahamCassidy #KillTheBill #ACA
You are #Deplorable to the nth degree. SHAMESHAMESHAME on you. All for Koch daddy $$$$$
States rights....wasn't that a part of a big conflict previously?   SC still hasn't learned
Lindsey Graham is a LIAR and CRIMINAL.

LOCK HIM UP!

If you want to know how great the Graham-Cassidy bill is for states, the bribe for Alaska is that THEY GET TO KEEP OBAMACARE!!
Are you selling your soul for seven pieces  of gold?
Bernie Sanders wants to give health care to everyone, And you want to take it away from 32 million. I think I'll go with Sanders

NEW: 579,000 #veterans among 19m who lose Medicaid under #GrahamCassidyBill: https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/news/2017/09/20/439277/coverage-losses-state-graham-cassidy-bill-repeal-aca/ … #ProtectOurCare #Handsoff (w @rwest817)
Really disappointed in Graham. What a heartless person. Taking health insurance from the poor and middle class. Deplorable!
I’ll bribe you with this if you stop your hate march in human beings. You love bribes
There's a special place in hell 4 you & yours. I'm 50, so I've watched the hill for a bit, & the @GOP has gone mad. Yes, I've read the bill.
#deaathcare
not ABOUT something that does not exist! This is about taking away what DOES EXIST! U want @GOP donor $'s at expense of your constituents
D. Your not the man I thought you were.
A. You really don't know what's in your own Bill B. You're playing politics w people's lives or C. You are truly greed driven.
It's the greed. Koch's are gonna cut  off the gravy train if they don't get their tax cuts. So what if a few million ppl die?

#lyinlindseygraham
TRUMPCARE IS A FORM OF GENOCIDE.

#BREAKING: All 50 Medicaid directors come out against GOP bill to repeal ObamaCare http://hill.cm/h25skCt  
Can you imagine SC running health care - the way they ran the pension system ???
Who do you trust?
Yes Lindsey isn't above a dog whistle "state's rights" when he really means money for rich GOP

Why in God's name aren't u listening to John McCain!  U must return to regular order & work with each other for a solution!
Confederate states seceded over "states' rights" (to own slaves). The argument wasn't any good then either.
Why don't you tout the glaring loopholes in your bill @LindseyGrahamSC? The ones that will hurt hard working American families...
Especially those people with preexisting conditions. Obamacare isn't great but this bill is worse for the majority of Americans...
So please explain these loopholes to the people. Tell us why they are there bc I don't see a reason besides keeping special interests happy.
States rights? Robert E Lee fought for states rights and was called a traitor. Are you a traitor, Graham?
States Rights. A code phrase in the South, that they still use to justify the Civil War. I am so ashamed of Senator Graham right now.
You are a liar. Why no CBO score? Are you scared you'll be outed as a....liar?
Where u lied your a** off? In other news not feelin' much support:
BREAKING: The bipartisan Medicaid Directors from all 50 states just issued this negative statement about Graham-Cassidy.…
States rights?!? Unless it suits the fed gov differently. Marijuana? Transgender choice?
You're going to #kill #Americans with #CassidyGraham

I'm not sure what "Berniecare" is but Medicare for all sounds pretty good to me. Why can't we have the same care you Senators have?????
States' Rights??? Harkens back a bit doesn't it?
States rights only works when R's like it. How about Sanctuary cities ? States rights, oh wait, then it is Federal rights. Hypocrites !
Good point!
@LindseyGrahamSC, Sir, you are lying.
All 50 State Directors of Medicaid are condeming #GrahamCassidyBill #GrahamCassidy.
Except preexisting conditions don't adhere to state lines @LindseyGrahamSC & @BillCassidy... #KillTheBill #SaveACA #GrahamCassidy


So u bribed alaska.. you sir are a fraud http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/21/alaska-medicaid-cuts-senate-obamacare-repeal-242978 …
If you think the #GrahamCassidyDeathBill is going to get you into heaven .... knock yourself out Linds ....
Not ok
“Get Obamacare repealed and replaced, get tax reform passed. Get it done and we’ll open it back up,” said a donor

Why do you keep lying @BillCassidy @LindseyGrahamSC?! #MedicareForAll  #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
Oh, #WeReadIt. Section 106 allows states to waive underwriting req's. Insurers could charge through the roof for preexisting conditions. 
Crappy bill Lindsey. Put down the bottle. Trump's a #dotard.
Stop your nonsense!!!!!!!!!!
Why do you hate kids @LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy #GrahamCassidy
Avalere, a consulting firm, modeled Graham-Cassidy's cap on Medicaid over time. Look what it does to children and the disabled. SAVAGE. 
The hidden truth pushing this crappy bill is threats from GOP mega donors that they will stop giving until repeal generates tax cuts
Smoke screen for destructive bill.
