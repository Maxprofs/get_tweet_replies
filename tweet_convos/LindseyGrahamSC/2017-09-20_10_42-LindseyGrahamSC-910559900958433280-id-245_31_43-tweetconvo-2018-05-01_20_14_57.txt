Chances this passes?
50-50
Kochs demanding return on investment. Time for Mitch to tighten the screws??
Vicious. Spineless. Cruel. Irresponsible. Disgraceful. Shameful. Unconscionable. Heartless.
We should reveal our #Recall Petitions
for them the same day the MSM & Fox will cover it.
The Koch's don't have enough money to save them
It's beyond official with the American Voting Population.  The GOP is cruel, hyper partisan and divisive, know NOTHING about how to lead.
Bringing it up then to skirt normal procedures since they are ashamed of it and know it is harmful to Americans that are not campaign donors

A bill -- finalized yesterday, has not been scored, amendments not allowed, and 3 hours final debate -- should be viewed with caution.
DEATH PANEL
Stop this unjust evil bill.  Keep free-market ACA.
Americans have told you scoundrels repeatedly they do NOT WANT this bill and you keep shoving the SAME BILL back at them. 2018 GOP is GONE.
Get those votes. Hope you win re-election with 17% of the votes like the number who support this bill.
You mean force down our throats!
How much is LG, BC and Mitch getting from Mercer for this disaster?  Bought and sold. Care more about donors than voters

Simple raise insurance rates, pre-existing conditions, #Autism should pay extra. Kids should be cut off at 18yrs = Job
& they want to do it w/in a week in the dark bc they don't want the pple 2 know just how shitty the deal is 4 them. Bc the GOP is evil AF

You try to destroy our healthcare, AND our democratic process.  NO hearings, no CBO evaluation.  ALL LIES, ALL SHAMEFUL @GOP

McConnell is a disgrace to KY and to the nation. Graham is a huge disappointment
Bring it up. It's gonna fail. Just like your legacy.  There was a time I supported you. What the hell happened, Lindsey?
And may it be struck down and rejected. Amen.
They'd  better ask their insurance cos, constituents and governors
Care NOTHING abt Americans.  For theGOP it is only & always Party over country.  Koch brothers $$$ over the people you swore an OATH 2serve
Lindsey pretends to be the kindly ol' uncle when he's really nothing more than a wicked politician who cares nothing about people.
I wonder what's going to happen when someone looses a loved one thanks to these scumbags?
Tell him voters want Sanders Medicare for all, not this! Easy to expand what's in place & increase payroll tax deduction. Still saves money!
So, Graham-Cassidy allows insurers to NOT cover:
-Pregnancy
-Newborn care
-Mental health services
-Prescription drugs
-Rehab
-Birth control
Does Lindsey have children?  If so how would he feel if they were born with a horrific disease and needed extensive medical and 24 hr care?
If it passes how much time before people start losing access to healthcare and die. With lifetime caps I give my disabled Grandson 2 years
@SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr @LindseyGrahamSC Why do we subsidize 3/4 of your health insurance premiums?
@LindseyGrahamSC is a liar and a disgrace. FIX  the ACA. You could, if you wanted to. Bipartisanship. You nixed that. Shame on you!!!
#VoteNOGrahamCassidy
You all only care about Party over Americans. I am ashamed that you are a senator of South Carolina.
Millions will lose insurance. You only care about passing something then actually thinking about how this will harm millions.
You are going to kill millions of people for your lack of empathy toward the sick, elderly, children, and women. You should be ashamed!
Well, this tweet certainly hasn't aged very well, eh @LindseyGrahamSC?
A bill -- finalized yesterday, has not been scored, amendments not allowed, and 3 hours final debate -- should be viewed with caution.
Resign-you don't serve constituents-Koch brothers puppets greedy racist corrupt lying murderous treasonous @GOP shame #SaveACA #nullify2016
Fix the ACA bill, thats what We the people want. Stop SABOTAGING it because you depise the previous President. We know why your doing it.

Kimmel, not Cassidy, is right on health care, analysts say http://politi.co/2ydCLI9 
I hope it fails it is repeal not replace that ain't what you ran on
McConnell makes me sick.
http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/20/jimmy-kimmel-bill-cassidy-obamacare-repeal-242932?lo=ap_c1 …
SHAME on you, Ocare is failing because people like you refuse to work bipartisan to fix it! you cant fool voters forever!
MR GRAHAM: I beg of you NOT to pass this bill. I'm 56 and would have DIED if not for Obamacare.
ARE YOU INSANE? This bill, if enacted WOULD KILL ME! SHAME ON ALL OF YOU!
Enough. Why don't you care about the people who elected you?  It will be on your conscience when we start to die!!
We shall send you the funeral bills.
What the fuck is your problem Graham? Is the concept of health care that difficult to understand?
Lindsey, take up hunting. You clearly need to kill something. Better deer than Americans and Koreans.
Read this, as this applies to all party lines.  This could be you:

Shame on my senator for rushing through a bill, just to appease donors. Our governor didn't want to expand Medicare & now you're blaming ACA
The American Medical Association opposes your healthcare bill??!!  Says your bill violates precept to "first do no harm".
All the cuts and restrictions on the working class is horrible.Say, let's cut the 84.25M/yr spent on erectile dysfunction. Buy ur own Linds.
This is most shameful act--88% of Americans hate the GOP bill. This is not about health but about midterm elections. Disgraceful politicians
No.  Not this bill.  There are too many holes in it for the State and Insurers to squeeze the poor and the ones with pre-existing conditions
Senator Graham I had my hope in you for President.  I believe you to be honest.  But this health care package is wrong.  Do better, please!
The bill is the same trash but wrapped up in a different bow. #regifting #trumpcare #killthebill
It's a terrible bill that will hurt a lot of people and since u represent me, my voice. Vote no on ur awful bill
@LindseyGrahamSC can't believe the GOP will literally burn in Hell with repeal of healthcare...ICYMI
If you too are disappointed in Sen @BillCassidy #GrahamCassidy let them know it - call (202) 224-3121 
We will donate and work to remove any senator who votes for this bill, no matter what state.
The ACA is not socialized medicine, just fix it. If you go forward with this bill you're sponsoring there will be a backlash to single payer
Single payer is socialized medicine & a bad idea. Don't be goaded into doing something stupid. You have an opportunity to fix the ACA, do so
Why are you so determined to condemn Americans to death #GrahamCassidyBill
Boooooooooo!  Your plan sucks!
#neverLindsey

This bill is all about making donors happy so the $ keeps rolling and so there $ for tax cuts for the rich.
Graham-Cassidy represents that sick that's in the Republican party - 2018 is comin!
JUST OUT: Under Graham Cassidy ACA repeal...

-a 31% cut to Medicaid for kids
-a 15% cut for ppl w/ disabilities…

@LindseyGrahamSC Heads up Americans! This removes preexisting conditions for EMPLOYER PLANS too!!
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO PRESENT THIS HEINOUS HEALTHCARE BILL AS YOUR NAMESAKE#TrumpCareKills @POTUS @SenateGOP @HouseGOP #CorruptGOP 
I have lost all respect for you
https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/18/16328856/american-heart-association-obamacare-repeal …   16 prominent health care groups say Graham-Cassidy bill is terrible.
I want to like Sen. Graham. Sometimes he acts like a sane conservative. But then he'll do something really stupid like this bill
Uhhhhhh how titillating!
Thanks for making #2018;easier for Dems.

For people with pre-existing conditions, the bill would remove any guarantee of coverage. 
You all don't want to be re-elected, we get your point loud and clear. we promise to help you out with that xD
Should call it Graham Cassidy Lying bill brought to you by spineless lying liars who lie with reptilian ease and unchallenged despicability.
This bill is a horror. Please walk a mile in our shoes. Would you do this to your family? It's not in alignment w/  christian values either!
Repub healthcare, taking away healthcare from every man, woman, and child in ID, HI, ME, NH, RI, MT, DE, SD, AK, ND, VT, DC, WY, WV & NE
You suck.
Doesnt CBO have to issue findings under reconciliation before this can happen?
Obviously it’s too important to wait for a CBO score or hearings. Let’s shove it down it in quickly.
The GOP doesn't work for the American people. This is a money grab for the super rich. They're also  traitors taking $$ from Putin & Russia.
#ACA #contactyoursenators #norepealACA @LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy #badforamerica #riseupfolks #tellthemno @SenKamalaHarris @SenFeinstein
It's very clear #lindseygraham about the majority of Americans. Instead of working with Democrats to craft a good bill he's made a deathbill
Lindsay Graham, I'm so happy that you will go down in history as a murderer. It's what you deserve. I was beginning to think you had a soul.
What % of Americans have you decided to work for? The 1% doesn’t need you to help them anymore. Grow a set and GET OFF TRUMP PUNCH!!!!

@LindseyGrahamSC If #Trump doesn't care abt 1 American, he isn't going to help millions. #SnakeOil #WillWorkForKoch$
Stop trying to divide our country. This has nothing to do with liberal or conservative...it has to with caring for our fellow citizens.
Preserve aca..no to graham cassidy death bill #ACA #PuertoRicoStrong
@LindseyGrahamSC Anything to keep rolling in Koch money. Kill & bankrupt Americans to make Top 1% more wealthy. Not #MAGA!!
Bad news..come on those GOP senators concerned about this bill, vote your conscience and vote NO. This warrants following the process
If you are pro life, why isn't pregnancy covered?
Jimmy is not wrong. Every objective sources agree.State control sounds good but in practice doesn't make lrg enough pool without mandate.
Graham is a liar! Murray and Alexander working on bipartisan changes for months!! How can you sleep at night!!!
Lindsey is a coward with no moral compass. It's time for a #TermLimits bill for all of these hacks. #Resist #GrahamCassidy #Obamacare
Graham @billcassidy decide who will be official Dr Death of the @gop. Bill Cassidy doubling down on the dishonesty
INFESTATION.....?..... CORPORATE IMPLANTS INFESTING YOUR FAVORITE POLITICO PARTY....!...CALL  1-2020- @SenSanders @BernieSanders
Independent groups insurance companies they tend to be agreeing with Jimmy Kimmel. Waivers will allow Independent states to change the rules
Shame on you! You only want tax cuts for your donors. Donors said if R's didn't get this done, no more money. Shame Shame Shame 
Insurance companies agree with Jimmy Kimmel. Graham Cassidy healthcare bill is a disgrace, taking insurance from millions.

ANOTHER article telling how HORRIBLE this new bill is #KillTheBill
JUST IN: Top insurer group opposes GOP ObamaCare repeal bill http://hill.cm/5fQ26C2  
Your house is tumbling down.
gop isn't  by the people for the people,, rather by the koch brothers for the koch brothers..is this democracy? @GOPChairwoman
When SEVERAL insurance companies and providers come out AGAINST this healthcare bill... You should #KillTheBill
Blue Cross comes out against ObamaCare repeal bill for "undermining" protections on pre-existing conditions http://hill.cm/OiHuojR  
Blue Cross came out warning people about your plan.  You are not for americans only for a win for #idiot in chief & GOP
GOP is no more then thugs, these aren't leaders, scholars, politicians, they are no more then thugs and corporate implants. @SenSanders
ring ring .... who? koch boyz we want our money back you suck..@SpeakerRyan @LindseyGrahamSC

These are the 3 to focus on. RT. Look up the zipcodes for their districts & leave a message. Their decision affects all of us. 202-224-3121 
More people will die because of you and your bill. Is that what you want, because that's what you'll have...their blood on your hands.
Why not make it the "latest last-ditch effort to STEAL FROM ALL BUT THOSE WHO NEED IT MOST???"  Hey, alt-right w/you @LindseyGrahamSC ?
Doesn't sound good for US citizens

What you are doing for fame is horrendous and unchristian. Millions will lose care and millions will be denied care. Care or tax cuts???
Rotten traitor. No respect left for you. Sickening.
https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/policy-and-politics/2017/9/19/16328928/obamacare-repeal-cassidy-graham-health-care-women …  
The Graham-Cassidy bill has all the problems of its predecessors — & some new ones making it harder on women.
How you strip coverage from people and still sleep at night is a mystery. The GOP condemns millions to life without healthcare
Liar !  The bill is CRAP !
We don't want your ammoral bill. All these free countries have universal healthcare except for the richest country on earth. Embarrassing.
Stinks to be called out for what your bill really is on national television.

Horrible sounding bill. Why the rush? Why not wait for the CBO report???? We Americans are pissed.
Total lack of empathy for our citizens .You should be ashamed . But its not like you actually give a damn.  #ACASavesLives
That gives you time to appear on @JimmyKimmelLive .......
You should be ashamed!
@LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy Whether your bill or AHA or previous plans: Congress has premium HC. How can you play politics with our lives?
How you, @SenateMajLdr & the @GOP can support this heinous bill & live with yourselves is beyond me. You've sold your souls.
Look, we all know that u got calls from Kochs & Mercers about this. They've promised u a big payday. This is the ONLY reason ur doing this!
They want tax cuts. They need to steal the money from Medicaid so they can go on with tax reform, Kochs cut them off till they get it done.
Punting back to states is a copout. The human suffering will be on you. You may no longer call yourself a Christian.
Has Capt. Mitch handed out life preservers? Answer: Of course not. 

#iceberg2018
#KillTheBill ALL Americans deserve decent #healthcare. #SinglePayer now!
This is a disgrace. You are going against the American people with this bill. I'd be looking for a new job if I were you. #VoteNo
STOP playing political games w/ people's lives & healthcare. NO  to Graham-Cassidy bill  IMMORTAL & INHUMANE
Stop SABOTAGING the ACA.  Fix it.
Jimmy Kimmel speaks for all the parents with ill kids. Lindsey you wouldn't have the slightest idea. Both you and Cassidy are LIARS!
Bright side: with all the people who will die under trumpcare, most will be YOUR voters! #gophatesamericans
SHAME SHAME.
The core of Graham-Cassidy is taking money from pro-Obamacare states and giving it to anti-Obamacare states:
Save the people, Kill the Bill !
SHAME
Graham could not even look into the camera yesterday when he was spitting out the lies about this so-called Healthcare bill.
If you have to hide what you're doing from the American people with secret testimony from just 2 people (Graham and Cassidy) - YOU ARE WRONG
Stop SABOTAGING the ACA and fix it.Jealousy of the previous administrations  is driving this
Want to kill affordable health care because it was a victory for a black president. Petty and sad. Single payer solves the problem.
You ppl are truly heartless and evil! God is watching you!
This is a CRAPPIER BILL THAN THE LAST REPUBLICAN BILL THAT FAILED...I wish Senator Graham had a SPINE...rather than put Party FIRST...LOSER!
A terrible, tragic bill. No CBO score. No input from stakeholders. No town halls. No hearings. This is shameful and anti-democratic.
Ur 'liberal talking points comment' doesn't change this POS bill! @jimmykimmel @JimmyKimmelLive was right on the money
Nursing homes and doing nothing for people who have preexisting conditions!  It will make people with cancer pay more for treatment!! STOP!
It also allows hospitals and Dr's decide what you pay for treatment!  Quit lying and own up to what your plan does indeed cover!  The truth!
South Carolina maintains low ranking on healthiest states list
Do you know how many people you will be screwing out of healthcare?  Healthcare for profit.  Healthcare for the healthy rich kids.

NEW: Blue Cross plans on Graham-Cassidy

Refutes everything Cassidy has been saying.
