So, how do you feel about the "Muslim Ban" trump tries to impose with executive order. Is this outside the rule of law too. All or none.
To target hopeful young strivers who grew up here is wrong, because they’ve done nothing wrong. My statement: http://facebook.com/barackobama/ 
#LindseyGraham You are a heartless man. God will punish you for your cruelty. He is punishing this country because of peple like you. #DACA
You're a socialist posing as a Christian. Fine to forgive, but you're giving away & wrecking OUR country. Let'em stay in YOUR house
Get a room.
More heartfelt handwringing and no useful action, I've already seen this movie.  
Why aren't you working on health care?? Worthless
So what!? Deport 'em!  #EndDACA
Please don't fake disapproval of Trump's actions on DACA. You support him. We know it. Party over country. DO NOT insult us, Lindsey #Racist
Prove to us you are not a heartless hack
Senator, I implore you to get this law passed. Punishing children will now be on the GOP. @Pontifex & Bishops have come out to #DefendDACA
It's not their fault but amnesty punishes US as if it's ours. The Pope & Bishops are hypocrites & you're a "liberal" giving away OUR country
You said trump is a good man. He is a racist, bigoted lying sociopath bent on destroying America. Shame on you for that statement. IMPEACH!!
I don't watch pressers unless there is a Republican there.
watched it, great. you look rested 
Biggest question is whether republicans are going to use DACA to extort funding for WALL? Reprehensible! Humans are not trade material.
@byrdinator @SenatorDurbin @YouTube Thinking outside the box .
SC no longer believes Lindsey Graham. He says one thing and then bows at the feet of trump. Hoping @SenJohnMcCain, we're depending on you!
Bipartisan...I'm half impressed!
I'm not even that. You know what George Carlin said about bipartisanship. 
Cruelty to Cruelty. DACA or no hurricane relief spending. Looks fair to me.
See if you can sell out your own party yet again. 
Let's get bipartisan passage to save the Dreamers. Thanks Senator's Graham and Durbin.
Yeah to MY Senator Dick Durbin.
Next are blacks, Jews, disabled and women.
No, next are crybabies like you.
The only good nazi is a DEAD nazi. @LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorDurbin
I am so disappointed in you. Not along the party line, but intead along the human line.
Do something to get rid of this unstable animal in the white house.
Senator Graham, America is hurt and angry. My unwanted advice is for you not to go out and defend Trump now!
Whatever. You've been complicit since you let him be nominated.
What about TAX CUTS?
#LindseyGraham, #UndocumentedDemocrat
Amnesty for invaders who go to college at our expense?
WTF? A reward for being rewarded for invading?
Step up Lindsey
PLEASE FIX THIS!!!  This steals the heart of what it means to be American.
Obey & enforce the laws of the land, regadless.. U took oath of the office ...what happened 2 ur morals? Focuse on poor US kids & dreams.SAD
#LindseyGraham, #UndocumentedDemocrat. The military should be a place of honor, not an amnesty mill for the children of invaders. #NoAmnesty
Senator, two wrong don't make it right. Why R we blaming the US?Those parents who knowingly &illegally crossed the boarder R2 blame.SAD
WHY ARE THE GOP LETTING THE OTHER 99% DOWN, SENATOR????
#DoSomethingGOP 
#SpinelessGreedyBastards
Amnesty for those who enlist or go to college (paid by us), punishes US as if it's OUR fault YOU let them in, paid their K-12, medical etc
We are counting on you and other forward-thinking senators please!

As this has turned into an emotional issue,a sense of urgency is required to solve it.
You're betraying the values of this nation to pander to bigots.  #DACA recipients contribute to USA economy & deserve to stay. Shame on you
Jeff Sessions on... 

Travel ban: President has expansive legal authority

DACA: President can’t act without congressional overview
Hypocrite. Tear down the Vatican wall!
Let's watch the Queens blame it on Obama. I'd rather have every Dreamer than any single person in or that supports the GOP. Party of hate
Opportunity to act on immig.  reform, not just #DACA. Will solve a lot of problems incl sanctuary cities. Work overtime, well pay for it.
Any Republican that votes for #DACA before #Obamacare REPEAL, #TaxRelief or #BuildTheWall needs to be VOTED OUT of Congress. Period.
I thought that ruling is made in the Supreme Court
You thought wrong. EVERY officer swears to uphold the Constitution. Comrade Obama defecated on it & US with DACA. Trump is sworn to rescind
Watch Durbin? Are you kidding? I'd rather watch Rosie O'Donnell work out.
The inclusion of funding for a wall in the DACA solution is insane... inhuman to the dreamers.  Sessions declaring DACA unconstitutional?
Do not forget, we still need Obamacare repeal & replace, tax reform, cuts, they are priority for the American People.
Went from Dream to Nightmare.
Do something
Where's that GIF of that scene from Star Wars... "It's a trap." Yeah. That's the one.
YOU Lindsey have LOST any lingering respect reluctant democrats EVER had for you; You are now a complicit PUPPET, your reputation shattered!
and @SenatorTimScott too 
Very bad day for America
Maybe some good news.
No Mitch?
I'm an so disgusted and outraged by this action! You all should be ashamed!
