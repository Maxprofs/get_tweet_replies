I hope you take Browder's concerns seriously & don't just dismiss as a bad spy novel. Country before part.
Do u know that Russia funnels money to American anti fracking environmentalists bc fracking hurts their oil business? Country over party
Mr. Graham I think I see a Patriot in you recently! Kind of like your working for the people! Thank you! We need Patriots to govern!

Don't investigate crimes? Don't ask questions about foreign agents/spies potentially being purposefully let in and ignoring FIRA? Not sure.
No skinny bill!Any bill that kicks mm off insurance is not going to cut it!Ppl.feel it's a daily fight 2 survive crazy WH &selfish Senate.
AIPAC was ordered to register in 1962, DOJ kept it secret.
Call Hickey back in & make him tell you the truth.
4. In fact, that lie, that you & Dems like to spread, is going to be harder to keep up when Imran Awan & family had access to the DNC &
 #NoBenczkowski or other political appointees to key positions. Don't aid in criminalizing gov't & deconstructing US democratic processes.
This recent transG is enough
Impeach trump now

Sir, still watching hearing. RE: State dept. Is there currently DOJ review before agreements w/"non-gov't" entities of our nat.resources?
Please stand for the rule of law- I have faith in you
3. emails to spread confusion and have people question our elections. No, NO ONE has shown the American public that Russia hacked the DNC.
2. Fusion GPS, you know, the company the Dems hired to run a smear campaign on Trump! Then YOU said we also know Russia hacked the DNC's
Everyone of these witch needs to end. Mueller should never have been appointed in the first place.
You and the whole GOP/house repubs need to IMPEACH this disaster you nominated.
So you can't get your head around Russia wanting dirt on Trump & also wanting Trump elected? HELLO one way or another they wanted him in WH
Remind the president that he sounds more like Nixon every day.
OMGosh, just watched your questioning.P hasT coming and going but i'm still considering source. Reading his book.Pride in grandfather.hmm
4. members of Congress' systems! When all the corruption comes out, I think your name might be right in the middle of it!
1. I have a real problem with your spin on stories. What we do know for a fact is that the Russian collusion was between the Russian gov't &

Welcome ur comments on Mueller, but you need to stress AG firing is improper bc it's an attempt to end probe, not bc Sessions is a nice guy
Are u high? Trump can fire his lame ass AG any time he wants.

Sen Graham, I just watched your interview on CNN. Thank you for standing up for American Democracy. You're my hero!
Hero? Well that might be a little overstated, although I do agree he's finally finding his balls. Truth is, however, in action not words.
He's a good speaker, but what is he actually doing?


Lisa Murkowski is standing up for the people she represents

She is doing what's right for them and not the…
No, she is standing up for keeping people enslaved on gov't handouts.
Thanks for being a voice of reason in a sea of MESS ~A grateful Democrat
