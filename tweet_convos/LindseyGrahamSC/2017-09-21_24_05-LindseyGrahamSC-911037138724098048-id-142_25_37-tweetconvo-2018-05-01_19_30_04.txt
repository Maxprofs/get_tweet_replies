SCUMBAG THE BILL WONT PASS BECAUSE ITS BASED ON LIES
You are a failure!!!
You are right about one thing, we are going to vote all you Republican out of the house and the Senate
Hypocrite! You are what is wrong with the US Senator - Cassidy is a liar. Both are wrong with US Senator.
I wish that you guys spent the time to not rush this through. I did my homework. Many have not. Please don’t rush something so important.
McCain = Back Stabber ..... Who is really GOP ???
Stop trying to take our health care away.  People can be bankrupted by medical bills.
They don't care because they make millions of dollars.

It's just too bad that SC does so little to keep it's citizens healthy. There will be a lot of deaths laid at the feet of Graham/Cassidy.
Why do you hate the general population so much?
Why put a heartless, failing bill to vote? To show your base you're trying, or to show the rest of the country you all suck at what you do?
Have you read the comments on your page. People hate this bill. Why are you obsessed? #GrahamCassidy
TRAITOR.  ARE YOU ENJOYING YOUR FREE LUXURY TAXPAYER SUBSIDIZED HEALTH INSURANCE???
Shame on you.
You will fail even if this bad bill passes.
Me Graham, I was just starting to respect you until this.

BREAKING: The bipartisan Medicaid Directors from all 50 states just issued this negative statement about Graham-Cassidy.…

So can you explain the cornhusker kickbacks and all that crap @LindseyGrahamSC ? Going back on your word to not support such things?
If this is the best you can come up, why don't you just admit that you don't know what the hell you are doing. #FixTheACA
WARNING! This is a propaganda page. The Republican party of yesteryear is gone. This is an extreme corrupt org working only for the wealthy.
Major mistake Sen. Graham! Why did I think that you were for the people of SC? Like the rest of the "IDIOTS," your head's up "HIS" ass huh?
I'd be cryin' too if I were Bill Bastardly
Wtf are you doing? Partisan healthcare will never ever work ! Especially one that has virtually zero support anywhere.

Yesterday @LindseyGrahamSC Said #GrahamCassidyBill bad idea Documented By the @CREWcrew Lawfirm
You should be used to failing.
Sen Graham is now the Biggest Lying Scoundrel on the Hill. He Cares Nothing for Americans' Health Care. He just wants a Vote at all Cost
Voting for the sake of voting???
It should FAIL. Millions lose cover & costs skyrocket for everyone else. Ends Medicare.Disabled, seniors, women, children, vets lose cover.
@LindsayGrahamSC Why are you sponsoring this bill? Please vote no even though you are a sponsor.

#BREAKING: All 50 Medicaid directors come out against GOP bill to repeal ObamaCare http://hill.cm/h25skCt  
Do you guys listen to EVERY MAJOR HEALTH GROUP IN AMERICA? Well you should. They hate your bill:
I know you are friends with Sen. McCain but I pray he will do the right thing and vote No. You are putting him in a bad position.
This better fail!
Yes, fail. #noGrahamCassidy
It's a shame that your name will always be tied to this. I always expected more from you. I guess I was wrong.
Why this if your bill is so great?
Why did I ever think you were one of the least worst? That was dumb of me.  You're evil.
All 50 Medicaid directors come out against GOP bill to repeal ObamaCare

Sadly Sen Graham you have already failed the people of our country. U bow to the Koch Bros $400m & push a bill w/o CBO, debates, revisions.
@BillCassidy We see right through this. Just trying to save your jobs. #Shame #GrahamCassidyNO #SaveACA
Just driving on SC roads is enough to tell me that I don't want the state having ANYTHING to do with healthcare.  You can't fix potholes,
Lindsey....don't you think you are reaching a bit?  #GrahamCassidy
Trading money for human lives
Of course you are cause you gotta push your murder bill or the Koch Brothers will cut you off. Religious Republicans?  Bull
you are going to vote. my wife is going to die. please try to explain to me how this is a good deal.
Lindsey Graham is a CRIMINAL.

LOCK HIM UP!
Big surprise. GOP's plan to repeal Obamacare for everyone except Alaska is likely unconstitutional. #GrahamCassidy http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/09/repealing-obamacare-for-49-states-probably-unconstitutional.html …
#deaathcare
This is a shit burger bill and you should be ashamed
Can I just ask why? What is the point? Like, just make the world a better place. What is wrong with you?

Epitaph--> Responsible for 32 million people losing their healthcare. May he rot in hell.
I hope it fails @LindseyGrahamSC , this bill sounds like your crapping on America and in the pockets of health insurance companies
Do you not get this is not about YOU, Lindsay? These are the lives of American people you are shortening to fund your f-cking tax cut.
Gotta save all those old white limp penis's couldn't have them not be able to hit on those 20 something interns.
Also why cut medicaid funding 4 women's pre & post natal and birth care but not funding 4 mens erectile dysfunction.
Shame on you @LindseyGrahamSC. Americans will die, and you know it. You will answer to God for this despicable plan. #SoldYourSoul
This today
#lyinlindseygraham
You're fuckucked... nobody want's this p.o.s bill.
If this bill was worth a damn then why do have to buy off you fellow GOP Senators to vote for this lemon of a bill.
You've given the middle finger to your fellow statesmen.  I'm waiting for you to put South Carolinians ahead of RNC Donors.
No hiding from this fiasco of a bill it does none of what you claim. Only causes hardship. SHAME ON YOU SENATOR.
@GOP If this passes and you voted for it, I pity you? I'm planning my life mission now?
I should clarify that, I am getting ready to start a non-profit that will expose you & #GOP for the hateful bigots you are.

When I'm homeless because of healthcare cost I'm coming to live in your office lobby and sleeping on your couch. 24/7 in your face.
Just imagine the jobs you could create by working to give America sustainable green energy and fixing our collapsing infrastructure.
Medicare 4 all gives us healthy workforce, free college larger qualified workforce and fixing infrastructure & sustainable energy jobs 4 all
You can do those things by making the top 1% and tax dodging corporations pay their fair share and a small reduction in DOD spending.
There are 4 ways you can improve America right now medicare for all, free college for all, fix infrastructure and sustainable energy.
It's high time congress started working to give ALL Americans a chance at a better quality of life an not just the top 1%
And instead of giving the wealthiest 1% more tax breaks how about giving all of our children a college education without a lifetime of debt.
Why do we need more weapons we already have enough to destroy the planet a 100 times over.  Use that money to give our children a future
This new bill will gut medicaid and cause major reductions in services in most every state many will suffer.
@LindseyGrahamSC  You're not completely stupid,but imagine that you're completely cynical:we're totally f'ed by Kochs+Russia therefore this?
If there is one thing we don't need is more bombs cut 10% of DOD budget and you could fund everything else and fix nations infrastructure.
Hey let's save some money by cutting some of the fat from defense spending. We already spend more than the next 27 countries most are allies
I guess you just want us all to be institutionalized again against our will out of sight out of mind just like prior to the ADA.
If states were doing such a great job we would not of needed the ACA to begin with.
But that won't happen because the GOP is beholden to big pharma gotta keep the insurance and pharmaceutical companies stockholders happy.
If you are so interested in saving money lets go single payer and take corporate interest out of the picture all together.
That lifeline to seniors, working families, children, and people with disabilities provides much needed life sustaining services.
Medicaid works—the proposed cuts will break the federal government's promise to fund a program that serves as a lifeline.
As a person with a disability in SC the medicaid cuts will gut the life sustaining services I need to live independently.
You are the swamp, sir. Political ideology &and political gain are more important than people's lives. Shame on you.
BREAKING: ALL 50 Medicaid Directors come OUT AGAINST Graham-Cassidy. ALL 50 STATES...LARGEST Health Insurance provider in the country.
Senator Graham has failed already. Numerous times.

"We are going to remove you from office" even if it means revamping our political system. Let's start w/contribution reform, shall we? 
Because you have refused to work for a bipartisan solution, allow meaningful debate, and consider a CBO score, you have already failed Sir.


And fail you will!
@realDonaldTrump u hate LOSERS. these guys LOST  multiple times already.... @SenJohnMcCain was scolded for being POW.. same for Graham Right

The Koch's 400 million demand we vote Are you going to bully any one who does not vote your way Graham since you now Trump-Mini Me
#ridiculous
It's just not gonna happen. Stop trying to make this #GrahamCassidyDeathBill a thing.
Fail Fail Fail
And sane, decent people hope it does fail. This proposal is a vile, cruel, heartless and dangerous piece of crap. Enjoy your legacy. #fixACA
Wait for CBO score. Oh, yeah, you're scared of that because you're stealing healthcare from millions of Americans.
Why do you keep lying @BillCassidy @LindseyGrahamSC?! #MedicareForAll  #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
Oh, #WeReadIt. Section 106 allows states to waive underwriting req's. Insurers could charge through the roof for preexisting conditions. 
Crappy bill. Lindsey is a disaster. Trump's a #dotard.
Why do you hate kids @LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy #GrahamCassidy
Avalere, a consulting firm, modeled Graham-Cassidy's cap on Medicaid over time. Look what it does to children and the disabled. SAVAGE. 
And fail you will
Every time I see traitor McCains mistress Lindsey Gramnesty.……… I know some hard working, honest Americans are about to get screwed
This needs to fail...bigly.
