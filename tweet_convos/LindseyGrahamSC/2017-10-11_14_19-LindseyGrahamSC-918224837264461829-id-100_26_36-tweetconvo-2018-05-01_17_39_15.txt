If our allies "over there" get wiped out, and they will if @realDonaldTrump & YOU start a war there, then u can bet the war will come "here"
What happened to "my party has gone bat shit crazy"?  Have you fallen for the snake oil salesman's charms?
Thanks fir supporting our new dicktator who killed our democracy w/ HC EO AGAINST CONGRESS & PEOPLE YOU SUPPOSEDLY SERVE! Enjoy  autocracy
Listen, Louise. Don't get in the car with Thelma. It won't end well.
A guy who cant walk a flight of stairs shoots a 73...how guilible must you think we are?
Franklin Roosevelt shot a 72.
Me Linsey  Graham .. what did you drink in you tea .magic potion!!  Filled with poo poo?  What was promised?  So, HE now is a great golfer!

|Breaking| Secret Footage Revealed: Trump & Graham Spotted Negotiating
That he eats Trump dick for breakfast, lunch, and dinner now?
Reminder: You're NOT allowed to delete ANY of this! So how's that @realDonaldTrump thing working out for you?! 
If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed.......and we will deserve it.
Yes, that something is called a conflict of interest, generally considered to be an ethics violation. http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/354978-graham-stands-by-claim-trump-shot-a-73-in-golf-game …
Here’s what he told us last year. He was right, too.
Did he mention this?
Was utter bullshit.

Why does Graham give Trump support?  Trump shared his phone number with everyone in the countryduring the primaries?
Trump cheats at golf and you know it. He's not going to give a damn if people curse him 20 yrs from now. He doesn't care now. .@JoeNBC
you may not like getting called out4 being a liar- but media never said 'Trump was a BAD Golfer'-they said yr claim of him golfing a '73'-

If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed.......and we will deserve it.
Stop the fucking insanity of Trump for God's sake. You all have lost any credibility or decency. Come down off your pedestal and try to care
No more money will be spent at Hilton Head. It is a Trump dump!
Oh I bet you spoke of the continued Russian Collusion with Putin. How deep are you in this Collusion? Is that you behind those flags?
Did you & DT discuss what a true patriot is?It has nothing to do w/a flag, and everything to do with a real moral compass. Not fake outrage
Sen. Graham, I respectfully need to ask you: how (or why) do you put up with Trump's lies? You obviously know better. He's a dangerous man.
Wow Sen Graham, what a risky conversation with DJT a disturbingly unstable uninformed leader. Dangerous
Your worst predictions about the Donald weren't bad enough. Make yourself heard & help Puerto Rico. Crazy to hope for that after your 73 lie
You played golf with a Commander-in-Chief who hasn't even acknowledged the death 4 Honorable soldiers killed in action. That is disgusting.
@LindseyGrahamSC @islandpacket
Did u discuss that the GOP no longer respects The fallen soldiers who make the ultimate sacrifice? #MAGA
A week week ago tonight #GreenBerets Johnson, Black, Wright and Johnson were killed in action in #Niger. Still no comment from POTUS 
Heard Hilton Head is becoming a dump. He shames it even more. ^^^
Graham stopped for "kool aid breaks" and wiped sweat from his brow Golf's Hard Work you know

Lindsey next time you are kissing up to trump please post this sign in the fro t yard of the White House..
Looks like you drank the Kool-Aid, Senator.
Where are the republican leaders , speak up ,YOUR COUNTRY NEEDS YOU!
tRUMP CHEATS AT GOLF, JUST LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE!!!

Top golf magazine casts doubt on Trump's score: "Patently unbelievable" http://hill.cm/vYz6ArG  
Ah come on.  18 holes in one? Who wouldn't beleive that?  He practices a lot.
Speaking to the chamber. They could care less about foreign policy. Just want all types of amnesty rammed through
It's #NationalComingOutDay Lindsey,  here's your chance.
Where do we send money to unseat Lindsay Graham. He’s turned yellow belly on us all and taking the heavy dark money to be Trump’s fluffer

Trump played golf on Monday instead of greeting the flag-draped coffin of one of the 4 US soldiers killed in Niger. https://www.salon.com/2017/10/11/trumps-benghazi-ambush-of-u-s-soldiers-in-niger-goes-unnoticed/ …
You have 0 credibility now. You've lost major support from the people THAT MATTER.
Like, do you need your lips surgically removed from that over-inflated orange pumpkin ass? FYI,  he golfs well b/c he does nothing else.
So it has come down to this...talking up his game...to hell with his instability.
The words I quoted are from Lindsey Graham re Trump. Look who climbed the fence.
Nice for public speaking, but he knows by now there were deaf ears and/or spite.
'He's the most unprepared person inthe entire field tobe commanderinchief, & over time I think it will matter.Americans had better wakeup.'
Lindsey...you’re as delusional as trump
Senator Graham, Trump is not mentally fit to make decisions about a military strike in North Korea. Don’t you see that??
Where are the republican leaders , speak up ,YOUR COUNTRY NEEDS YOU!
Did you discuss the surge of activist white supremacists, and their emboldened activities. Para military white supremacist go to college.
Wish I knew he would be here, I would have strolled over there with a nice sign to protest.
20 years from now people will say who the f*%# elected these morons.
Was the audience paid to be there?
Huh?
Tell this to the millions of South koreans the north will use as proxies for American casualties.
Senator Graham, such concern for the people of South Korea.
Are you drinking the Koop-Aid or just trying to keep Trump stable? From out here in middle America, he looks off his rocker and moronic.
"I played golf with him and, believe me, his racist jokes are phenomenal... the best!"
Perhaps you discussed how the president allowed the Jones Act to again restrict imports, and at this time, relief to Puerto Rico post Maria
Looks like another one drank rhe koolaid.

If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed.......and we will deserve it.

The FY18 Budget gives $1.5TRIL in tax cuts to the richest Americans. It cuts about the same from Medicaid & Medicare. Whose side are you on? 
Let me guess. He told them that Trump is a DISGRACE to our country but well support him anyway in the name of tax reform?
Was it about your golf round w/Donald Trump. U said he had 18 holes in one, right?Any mention of these heros? Thank you for your service LG
We need to fund people that will give power back to the people, not their self serving agenda
No amnesty no it’s a crime it’s wrong ... it’s clogging our court system and healthcare . GO BACK do it the right way
Let me guess, it was something like: "The whole deal about small hands, totally true"...
