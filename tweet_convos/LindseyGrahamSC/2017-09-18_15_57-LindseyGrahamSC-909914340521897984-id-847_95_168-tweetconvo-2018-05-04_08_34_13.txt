@freedomcaucus a evil secret groupwill do any thing to hurt Americans like Cassidy & Graham. Their anti-American activities must be stopped
Screw you Lindsey Graham.
oh so you are the chief of the Christian weirdo lunatic caucus...go back to your red state sh-thole!
Promote CO- OP Hospitals. 
Give people another option.
This is the way to control HC cost.
Insurance Co have american people on a " choke hold " !

They can raise  the price any time they want and you can do nothing  about it.
Lindsey, every once in a while you seem like a rational human. This is not one of those times.
@BillCassidy @politico
Lindsey, remember more people voted against Trump than for him. We are not all Bat Shit Crazy. How did you catch it?
Lots of people BADLY WANT to #VoteAgainst what they see as the #GreaterEvil but until we fight for a #BalancedBallot there's no such option!
McConnel and Ryan thinking this bill will pass....sorry NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

Dear @LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy & @realDonaldTrump Fuck y'all and the Big Pharma, Big Insurance, Koch Sucking, horse you rode in on. 
Sorry, but the House won't even get to see your crappy bill. Decent Republican senators will vote NO on this bill that hurts everyone!

Obamacare is failing because of GOP backdoor deals with @mtbert to trade ACA market collapse for anti-competitive mergers. https://twitter.com/SenateMajLdr/status/910569501921443840 …
The @freedomcaucus supporting means this is on of the most vile evil bills to date. They like the authors only want to see Americans die.
Hear tell you don't even know your own bill. Sick AF
You used to be a moderate. Now you’re a right winger. Did they threaten to reveal something about you? Wonder what?

of course they would - they have their insurance
for it anyway. THANK GOD SENATOR @SenJohnMcCain VOTED AGAINST IT! I HOPE AND PRAY HE WILL AGAIN. IT WILL KILL MY HUSBAND. NO MORE TREATMENT.
Lindsey, I'm SO sad that you called the last bill written over a lunch was a fraud. This bill is worse than that one. You ended up voting...
Do not repeal the ACA. Your healthcare bill is deplorable.
Jimmy Kimmel wll take your job!!  LETTING KIDS DIE IS NOT AN OPTION YOU GREEDY BASTARD!

If you too are disappointed in Sen @BillCassidy #GrahamCassidy let them know it - call (202) 224-3121 

Kimmel, not Cassidy, is right on health care, analysts say - POLITICO Pro https://www.politicopro.com/health-care/story/2017/09/kimmel-not-cassidy-is-right-on-health-care-analysts-say-162156 …
The Freedom Caucus should be called the Mean Caucus.

No conserv who cheers ripping away the insurance for babies born with critical diseases (for tax cuts) can EVER claim to be pro-life again.
Sad - please work on bipartisan solutions  to the ACA!  #countryoverparty
You’ve denied that this repeal won’t deny coverage for pre-existing conditions. Prove that please. #ACA
You are lame excuses 4human beings. I hope you are prepared for your eternal rewards &like one another enough to be Nhell together forever
I thought u were an ok guy, but ur just like those killers before, no insurance for the poor people, how do u sleep.
You should be ashamed of yourself. Your bill is a death sentence &/or a straight shot to bankruptcy for ppl like me w/preexisting conditions
Nothing last forever and you are not the exception. One day..one day your end will come. Be afraid very afraid
Of course the house would. They are a bunch of heartless asses.

Of course he did. He got paid to. 
Oh but kudos to the Republican governors calling you out.
The GOP are a disgrace.  The red states will ruin health care on purpose, GOP being the party of cruelty.  Pass the buck cowards.
Don't call yourselves freedom caucus/ Nothing free about what you're doing BESIDES YOUR CADILLAC HEALTH PLAN THAT WE PAY FOR UP THE ASS!
Please explain how your bill, that would ultimately let kids like mine die, is good for the country.
Lindsey Graham has now proven his lack of Kahunas. Seems a gutless warrior willing to "just let people die." For Graham, "America Can't."
KOCH CARE
#VoteNOSmokeAndMirrorGCBill This bill will have Catastrophic #RippleEffects 4 Millions of Americans. #ShameOnU4Lying2Public #NoIntegrity
Section 106.  Cassidy lies
#GOPSerialKiller majority of citizens wants you to fix ACA not repeal. #Racist willing to kill us to undo anything Obam & give rich TaX cut
you & @billcassidy lie: Jimmy Kimmel says Sen. Bill Cassidy lied to his face over #Obamacare repeal http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jimmy-kimmel-bill-cassidy-obamacare-repeal_us_59c1d627e4b0186c2206bc2c?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004 … via @HuffPostPol
You are a good man but dead wrong on health care
Why are you doing this to us? Why do you want to hurt so many people?
@BillCassidy @politico disgusting.  America. Fascists not for American people. For self, party and dictator trump. Shame.
you are an embarrassment to our nation.
@BillCassidy @politico
If you too are disappointed in Sen @BillCassidy #GrahamCassidy let them know it - call (202) 224-3121 
Sometimes I feel like Graham supports wars and hurting others because people inferred he is a dandy.
Support of #FreedomFromCaringCaucus should have been 1st clue #GrahamCassidyDeathBill bad for Americans. #StopGrahamCassidy

This will plan will kill our kids, @LindseyGrahamSC . Wake up.
WTF happened to you, do you have mommy issues and hate all women? You've turned into a perfect slug like Trump.
@jimmykimmel will go down in history as a hero of our time. You will not. Is that the legacy you are hoping to leave?
Lies!
What a joke your caucus is. Nothing but the white freedom caucus to repudiate the black president
SHAME on you Senator. You are trying to kill Americans.
Traitors
@GOP DeathCare Bill ... Koch Bribe $$$ is calling  
Your death plan will leave millions without insurance. Those with pre existing will no longer be able to afford their plans. You & plan suck

A bill -- finalized yesterday, has not been scored, amendments not allowed, and 3 hours final debate -- should be viewed with caution.
Unless you want to be replaced, Lindsey...walk away from this. 

Right. Now.
You were elected to represent THE PEOPLE. Not Trump. Not Corps. Not Rich people. Not Putin. Lindsey, you WILL eat these words one day.
AKA that means the bill is cruel enough for the freedom caucus
Graham/Cassidy is an evil plan, will lead to  loss of homes, savings and lives Does this mean you are evil or just misguided?
You should be ashamed.  Pure evil.
@BillCassidy @politico
Are Ms. Lindsey's "proctological" exams by male escorts covered under the new deathcare bill? #hypocrite
You Look like a good guy. 
But you're not.
shame. shame. shame.
You are destroying our country...stop...you are hurting people
Done with you, Lindsey.
I can't follow you anymore - Cassidy and you ... you let us down
Ah there's the real Graham. Fooled me for a bit with your sensibility but you're back to your old lying crooked self.
Is this really a bill you want to be remembered for? Something that hurts millions and benefits those that are already well off. Sad 
Posterity will not be kind to you if #GrahamCassidy becomes law. The backlash will strengthen support for single payer & risk Repub majority
Shame on both of you. You will singlehandedly be responsible for the economic collapse of the United States. Your hands are soaked in blood.
Of course they would pass a plan that strips healthcare from millions...because they are so "pro-life."
WTF Why throw people under the bus?  No protection for pre-existing conditions, maternity care?  If men gave birth they wouldn't do this

SCOOP with @rachanadixit: HHS secretary Tom Price has been taking charter jets to conduct government business. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/19/tom-price-chartered-planes-flights-242908 …
Disgraceful

By saying Bannon is good with it he means the Mercers -the money behind the GOP- are good with the #deathcare bill
Healthcare for profit is cruel and unaffordable. HMOs, Health Insur, drug ads, are the problem. I remember before all of this.
You are selling your sole for a hollow victory. You are throwing 32M people and Senator McCain under the bus. FEEL GOOD??
https://www.facebook.com/jimmykimmel/videos/1977414852535607/ …
It'll be your party's demise!!! Yeah!!! @DNC @dccc @IndivisibleTeam @indivisible_brd @SWFLIndivisible @marcorubio @VernBuchanan yours too!

People with pre-existing conditions, pregnant women among those who lose out in GOP's latest health care bill. http://apne.ws/iP7et7Z 
U have ZERO morals, ethical thought/action. Once thought u might actually care, when u worked w Sen. McCain 2 rein in DJT. But I was wrong.
What's the CBO score? And when you get all red faced at the mic, think about the all of lives the could rest with this "bill." God Bless You
Hey Lindsey, I found out who got to you. The Koch brothers. No money for you until you do their bidding. Shame.
Trump is your dream.  No amount of feigned disgust erases that. Good luck with your soul. #GrahamCassidyBill #ACA

The staggering hypocrisy of Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/19/16330094/cassidy-graham-hypocrisy?utm_campaign=vox&utm_content=entry&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter … via @voxdotcom

Broad coalition urges New York Congressional delegation to oppose harmful #GrahamCassidy bill. 
Why are you trying to break everything that's good in our country?
I just love the names you jokers come up with - Freedom Caucus for one!!  It should be called Freedom to Die 'cause that's what will happen
I used to have some respect for you as a moderate seeming Republican. There are no moderate @GOP Your health plan is a disgrace! #GOPSucks
Me Graham you and your death part just signed the death certificate of my wife and any cancer patients in the USA. And all for tax cuts
Shame on all of you. You're about to hurt millions of people to get Trump a win. Why do you refuse to fix instead of destroying the ACA.
iF YOU DONT A HAVE A PERFECT PLAN TO REPLACE HOW CAN YOU repeal DUMDUMS. dO YOU MILLIONS OF PEOPLE PROTESTING?
THAT SAYS ALL THAT NEED BE SAID ABOUT HOW CRUEL THE GRAHAM-CASSIDY HC BILL IS. IF PASSED, REPUBS'LL BE REGARDED AS COLD BLOODED KILLERS!

Sooner or later you all will pay for your actions against the American
People. Wish u the worst of cancers
for all of you

Billy's helping me write tonight's monologue. I'll give our thoughts on the #GrahamCassidy health "care" bill. @BillCassidy @LindseyGrahamSC 
Needs to get rid of more of the taxes and REGULATIONS...in fact...get Gov't the hell OUT of our health care PERIOD!
And second, work with your colleagues to improve the ACA for all!  Your plan is an injurious cop out for me and my family!
First, http://lgraham.senate.gov  is a no go.  Send me a GOOD email address so I can share my story, please!  jenniferhosterman@comcast.net
Yeah @freedomcaucus is holding out to take healthcare away from more Americans. You are catering to the minority with money. We outnumber u.
#SHAME! Killing tens of thousands by pushing them off healthcare. How will you be able to live with yourself? #WhatWouldJesusDo? #GOP
You have no conscience.
@MTPDailyTweets yes Dem know Ocare is failing and needs to be fixed who that guest BS
Senator, you are pushing a bill that will rip healthcare away from millions of Americans with no CBO score. Pathetic.
I am just wondering if Cassidy & Graham are taking all the drugs they are trying to take away from the people?  Cassidy can't be a real Dr.!
Hellbent to screw the American people out of healthcare. No public debate. No open meetings. No policy explanations. Tax cut for rich only.
You really want to be the guy who is praised for killing ppl by taking away their healthcare? I pity you. Can't be who you are around others
It's *criminal* that Congress works so little and get so much while someone on minimum wage Works everyday for so little. We have the money

who needs healthcare when #halfamerica will #vaporize in #NuclearWar #schizopresident #rankgop
If pre-existing conditions were not covered I would go blind w/macular degeneration. But how many would DIE from other causes??
PLEEEEZE give us "full blown single-payer socialism" !!  OK
leave our insurance alone in light of all these disasters you would even think of pulling this s___!  your all liars on how accurate CBO
How can you turn your back on vets, shame on you GrahamCassidy bill will hurt the vets and you know it and don't care!
Graham-Cassidy aka #TrumpCare fails on three levels: 1. More expensive  2. Less coverage 3. Covers fewer people #GOPFail

JUST OUT: Here's a summary of the Graham-Cassidy repeal. Yes, it's that bad.

Spread far and wide if useful. 




Watch the VIDEO. Find out what is really in the bill. On @MSNBC with @JRubinBlogger
You are dispicable.I'm going to press you and Cassidy hard on this.I will not allow you to lie about your crazy bill without questions
Great presentation this afternoon! Five, old, wealthy white men. Very representative! I've been to South Carolina, it don't look like that!
All I heard from you were threats. What about details?  You don't care about people you just want a "win"
