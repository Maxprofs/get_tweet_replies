(A) The ACA is not socialism. (B) This is what your Federalist bill will do to your own state:

Game plan: Scare people with frightening words like "socialism" to mask the  shortcomings of an inadequate piece of legislation.
The government shouldn't be running healthcare period.
Involved or running?
Not involved nor running it. Not saying their shouldn't be laws against Malpractice etc.
Fair enough. Logically I would say why have govt involved or running any public services? Police, fire, utilities, education etc.
Because it by the people for the people in the local level.
I would argue that a lot of health services are set up in that same way, but let's say they're not. Why can't they be set up the same way?
That's a good question. I'd say it can only work if people agree that are in that area. You take away locals choice to choose, it won't work
Hope he’s right!
Me too
Something sure lit a fire under your ass, huh? Could it be the Koch bros. refusing to give you $ until healthcare & tax reform are passed?
Obamacare is not socialism

Universal healthcare is not socialism 
Repeal the 3.8% investment tax. It will only lead to uncontrollable spending.
Stop saying that-- you know it is a lie, why have you turned on your constituents Some sweet deal?
U don't have a problem with Socialism when it comes to Corporations.
I hate that skank, but he is slightly better that a democrat. Slightly!
Lindsey, pull out all stops and get some Democrat votes! Don't give up!!
Bernie even said a number of years ago that single payer socialized Heathcote would bankrupt the country. Why does he push it now?
@MeghanMcCain  Senator Graham .... Mr. McCain = Back Stabber

We already have socialism and it's far better for America than GOP oppression and bigotry.
This is death vs life.
This is money vs morals.
Only sources you people can ever get "good" coverage in is FOX News, New York Post and National Enquirer---that should tell you something!!
Socialism as in caring medically for all our citizens is a good thing for a democracy to consider.
I would put all politicians on Obamacare with no subsidies and see how they like it
"For the People, by the People," not "for the people, subject to the government." Why do you think America was created??
Thanks John ....  can I have another ??
Put congress on the same healthcare as everyone else take away their subsidies
Better to die a Federalist than to survive and prosper from socialist programs, I guess.
I guess Death is the ultimate freedom, right? Thanks to Senator McCain and all who will kill this brutal and misguided bill.
I hope your are right about a couple of Democrats coming on board. Your "friend" has let us down again.  ACA does not work.
Republicans litterally wake up in the morning trying to figure out ways to hurt as many people as possible. The party of cons, lies, & death
That's an inflammatory stretch. Having Government program,, which we already do, is a far cry from Socialism. Look it up in the Dictionary!
Do something about McCain. Killing us - should have to have Obamacare, maybe he would change his tune.
Graham has forgotten principles and integrity of rep'ing the American people.
So, socialism is okay for education, but not for health care? What are you afraid of? Health care for profit is shameful. #healthcare #fear
@LindseyGraham - sigh...ur still on @foxandfriends because it is full of #Propaganda shit!  Do us a favor. Pls try to work with all parties
Not happening due to buddy John Complain and fellow losers Rand Stall, Judy Stalin and Mitch Old McDonald. #MAGA but not with them. Losers
How does it feel to be stupid 24/7?  #MAGA
Sorry, Sen. Graham, your best bud just said he wouldn't support it.
Apparently your buddy McCain isn't your friend but the traitor we all knew he was!
Shame on you @LindseyGrahamSC !!!
Senator McCain standing up for COUNTRY FIRST
Tools
It's not about #MedicareForAll - but fixing the current system. Most Americans like ACA. #GCBill will cause about 30M to lose care #SaveACA
Respectfully, Senator, wasn't it you who said that #Healthcare should not be pushed through quickly w/o debate? Now, your doing exactly that
Hey Lindsey come out of the CLOSET we can't hear you.....it's ok some of us will still accept you !
Sen.Graham speak to your "tween" McCain. For this old fool vendetta toward POTUS is more important then wellbeing fellow Americans
His butt buddy McCain just said he won't vote yes.
THIS IS LIES VERSUS TRUTH. NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SEE YOU LOSE INTEGRITY. I WAS WRONG
Condemning people to either financial ruin or poor health/death excites you @LindseyGrahamSC ?   I never thought I'd see the day.
I get it no socialism. Pass this bill please thanks four  stepping up some of your cohorts did t
Lol if this is true, then why not vote after sept deadline? Sounds like ya got 60 Graham! Oh right, you're lying
This is FREEDOM VS. IMPRISONMENT.  If I get cancer & Lindsey confiscates my insurance, I'm not "free," I'm broke & then #DEAD.
Dr Death @BillCassidy lying rebuttal to Jimmy Kimmel: ‘More people will have coverage’ - The Washington Post
you know that is not true Sen. Graham.  I can't believe you are pushing this horrid bill that no healthcare org supports. Why?
This is atrocious - the killing of people to make political donors happy. How low can you go Lindsey? No respect left for you!!!
If this bill is so great, Y are u & ur constituents trying 2 bribe Sen. Murkowski by letting Alaska keep ACA if she agrees 2 vote yes.
I see it as with the States we have 50 attempts to get it right vs leave it with the Feds and the track record is not good and all suffers

That Republicans are bribing Murkowski by letting Alaska KEEP OBAMACARE pretty much destroys the idea that this is better than Obamacare

No. ACA already provides great flexibility, States have unique programs, choice to expand Medicaid. Fix, don't break, the ACA.
U may hope you will win, but your face and name will be linked to the misery you create for the American people.They will remember you !
All these gop senators that vote for Koch's need to be voted out. This world by Koch needs to stop.
God I hope, I can't take much more @1262.00 a month. Two years ago it was 428.00 a month and that's a 3000.00 deductible folks
That's how you'd like to frame it, but it's not. It's cruelty vs. compassion.
This is Pass to "Vally of No Returns for Next Generation & end of constitution Rights". Ston Age mentality!!!
It's people who love money and hate others. Don't be fooled
Nice try framing this in another way. This is health care vs reduced health care and tax breaks. Regular Order Please.
This is greedy people vs citizens
When an entire industry is against something, shouldn't you listen? Pure politics over people. + Obama hate.
What if you live in a sucky state
Ask yourself why you have to lie to get a healthcare bill passed.., and why every Medical Association is against it
Yada yada yada you are lying. Fake news
dad makes $90k a Mom makes $90k YET a gov Funded Paycheck pays 1/2  of #SS medicare Tax than a #Gov #Employee that makes $180K, its #THEFT
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan If it doesn't i know some folks who won't be RE-ELECTED in 2018 & 2020! GOP don't blow it!

Federalism is in the lobbyist pockets. I'll  take socialized medicine for 1000
NO, dude you are so confused.  This is LIFE instead of DEATH.  This is coverage for PEC, and pregnancy, and catastrophic health problems.
Read the Federalist papers.
I don't think u know what those words mean Lindsey.
Ok Senator Social Security is socialism too...worlds greatest retirement system
Does Lindsey get a special #koch bonus for this particular bullshit talking point?
Like, explain how Washington approving your states healthcare system is "Federalism"?
And how is it "socialism" for US to require certain basic coverage?
Actually this debate is between "healthcare is a privilege for the rich" vs. "....a basic human right."  Pass Medicare for All.
Lindsey Graham needs to spend his time protecting the constitution and our sovereignty from the lawless Russian puppet in the White House
Correct statement.
social security and public education is socialism too wingnuts. so are the farm subsidies and VA hospitalis
Should chand the name of your program to Fox & Fools
God will punish you..
Every. Single. One. https://twitter.com/thehill/status/911183557170794497 …
Healthcare vs No Healthcare that's your offer just to be able to say you repealed and replaced 
@LindseyGrahamSC  "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few" (Spock), except in the @SenateGOP #GrahamCassidy
Why not let the CBO score the bill before trying to pass it?
Not sure who tells more lies, Fox News or Lindsey Graham.
@LindseyGrahamSC @SpecialReport who do not have the good of all as their motivation. #tyranny #GrahamCassidy $$$$$$$$ talks.
@LindseyGrahamSC @SpecialReport No, this is #tyranny The fate of the majority of the country is in the hands of 52 people.
Your job is to meet the needs and wishes of the American people.  It is not your job to PUSH your ideology on the public in defiance
"THIS IS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE vs WEALTHY GOP DONORS". Period.
More BS from you and GOP. You could have fixed ACA years ago. Now shoving a scam bill through Senate to fulfill promise made by #putinpuppet
Actually, a MASSIVE involuntary xfer of wealth from blue states to red is socialism. Poly sci 101.
What are you going to do when America figures out what this is really going to do their lives?
so is "socialism" ok for every American over 65, but everyone younger gets federalism? Or are you eliminating Medicare too???
Whoa, big fella. Put that tiny GOPenis back in your pants. Two can play at that game. I predict your remove Obama from history bill fails.
@LindseyGrahamSC #NoToGrahamCassidy #NoToDeathcare
Since 2010, 82 rural hospitals closed in states w/ no Medicaid expansion. Repeal could close up to 700 in next 10yrs
@LindseyGrahamSC #NoToGrahamCassidy #NoToDeathcare
#NoToGrahamCassidy #NoToDeathcare
When I was a young man, we call you people like you a communist.
If it passes it will financially & emotionally ruin many hard working American families. Even more than Obamacare. Sit down & try again...
Try to write a bill without the glaring loopholes this one has designed to screw American public w/ higher premiums, worse coverage etc...
Try to write one that doesn't just benefit a select few special interests but instead benefits hard working Americans (your constituents)...
Whatever the answer is, it's definitely not this bill. Unless your goal is to screw the American people yet again. #KillTheBill #VoteNo
Socialism more HUMAN than "we have to pass something " @LindseyGrahamSC @foxandfriends
Going to provide a kickback to Alaska senator now??
Somebody said you have a "last shred of decency" but I defended you against the allegation, sir
This debate SHOULD be abt yr bill, and it's abuse to the poor, elderly and those with pre-existing conditions.  Single payer is diff issue.
Trump hasn't paid TAXES for 20 YRS. He doesn't get a say so in how WE that paid it SPEND IT! HEALTHCARE 4 ALL!
give me socialism or give me death without healthcare coverage.
U CAN SPEND $700BIL MORE  FOR DEFENSE BUT NOT FOR HEALTHCARE TO SAVE LIVES! PRIORITIES R ASKEW!
Down With Graham
We will see Your SICK
@LindseyGrahamSC @SpecialReport Do you have a plan for implementation? All 50 state Medicaid managers are against this.
Not even a "Human Being "Graham Got Defense Spending -
Insurance Package You are Playing with Millions Of Lives and You are SICk
No Lindsey....is a trick....Medicare for all
Your Party is on life support as we speak. This bill will put it in the ground.
No gramy..its a few white rich gop men..against every human being that understands the importance of health care for all...
.@realDonaldTrump U R the ultimate CONMAN hahahahha UR bribing states with letting them KEEP ObamaCare!  Must B better then UR plan! #FixACA
They are worried more about their donors then the American people @realDonaldTrump has changed nothing in Washington he said he'll sign #Sad

You are selling us out @LindseyGrahamSC . I have lost my respect for toj
You
I hope so
Give it whatever political moniker you need to justify ripping away healthcare from those you’re meant to protect. Shame on you
Come on Lindsey, stop the nonsense, this is not a good bill and  it dosent justify passing it just to get rid of Obamacare.
This is a bill and he knows it hope he has bad dreams every night if someone who passes because  this crap bill
Literally nobody but donors wants this bill.
and Lindsey what about more of the "Cornhhusker Deals" that you now support???

Since 2010, 82 rural hospitals closed in states w/ no Medicaid expansion. Repeal could close up to 700 in next 10yrs

It is EVIL! If socialism saves lives, SO BE IT!
Move to Venezuela for socialism and starvation.  The are even in a national wide protest that you can have fun.
But Russia taking over the US to start a nuclear war with #NorthKorea is ok? The GrahamCassidy bill is a disaster. #RepealandGoFuckYourself

No @LindseyGrahamSC this is stupid vs sensible, wanting a win vs taking time to do it right. States will not correct all the bad for you!
Sure.  And your doppelgänger says this: https://twitter.com/lindseygrahamsc/status/860162852614803456 … #killthebill
A bill -- finalized yesterday, has not been scored, amendments not allowed, and 3 hours final debate -- should be viewed with caution.
Cbo not accurate for original OBcare way off
Your bill is a POS. I can't stand you or your weaselly politics. DISUGUSTING!!
Let's let the states constituents decide your healthcare too?  I wouldn't mind having that power back in the states hands
Better yet get government out and return healthcare to the insurance market.  If you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.
Why is everyone but you, your greedy GOP buddies and Koch bros want this!! Take from poor give to rich. Give Alaska aca take from us!! Slug
@LindseyGrahamSC @SpecialReport 

Hypocrisy:
A bill -- finalized yesterday, has not been scored, amendments not allowed, and 3 hours final debate -- should be viewed with caution.

No Senator.  This is American need vs corporate greed. Grow a pair and slip the lead of your corporate masters. #singlepayernow
Have you no soul?
No. And again Lindsey doesn't understand definition of either. Jeez people
Your health bill is horrible. How can you do this to hard working citizens just to make a few nasty rich people happy!
Oh Lindsay... I'm an independent, and I remember the time I thought of you as one of Washington's the ethical few. RIP: your morals.
I felt the exact same, Jo. Truly breaks my heart when Lindsay Graham - the man who loves Joe Biden like a brother - turns the corner.
So sad, truly
Why, because you bribed @lisamurkowski? Biggest hypocrite ever @LindseyGrahamSC
Apparently Lind$ey doesn't know what Federalism means.
And so it goes... it's name calling, not policymaking; it's scoring points, not scoring impact (CBO); and of course $$ for tax cuts for rich

No. It is NOT. THIS IS LIFE VS DEATH. #GrahamCassidy GOP #DeathCare ends cover for MILLIONS and everyone else pays more. 
#SaveACA
If you are on or like Medicare, you need to give up on subscribing to this ignorant fear mongering!
24% of Americans disapprove of your bill.  Yet, you wont stop pushing. Why, I wonder?  *cough* Koch Brothers *cough*.
You're a fuckin liar  Lindsey
Oh bullshit, this is a horrible bill that the entire medical profession and most of the nation http://opposes.GOP   at its craven worst
Exaggerate

If the US government would cut income tax by 80% states could raise their taxes to pay for their own healthcare programs !
Selling your soul for a win for @realDonaldTrump - I've lost all respect for you. Millions will suffer if you prevail.
And millions will suffer with the crushing democrats Obamacare. 

This man is a liar and a total ass.
