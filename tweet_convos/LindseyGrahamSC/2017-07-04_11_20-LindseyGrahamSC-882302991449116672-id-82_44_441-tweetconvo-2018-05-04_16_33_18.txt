Get back to work how many vacations do u need
Please restore her to what she was. This is a freaking mess. The @Gop will be held accountable.. those not stepping up.  Thank you.
The @AmerAcadPeds &@AmerMedicalAssn oppose the #BCRA. Stand up for low income families, kids, vets, and seniors!
Like celebrating July 4th? Do something about Trump before we start celebrating Lenin's birthday. Don't slow play this. G20 a Putin lovefest
Kinda late here. Please be a man and stop the madness.
Please keep us safe by voting no on Trumpcare. McConnell's bill will hurt many more Americans than Obamacare.
Special thanks and Happy 4th to the families of fallen heroes who served our country with HONOR!
Happy 4th from your friend @georgesoros
Happy Fourth of July Senator Graham!
And you too Sir. I am hoping you will turn out to be one of the white hats. God bless.

This picture is a lie it's still daylight in sc.
And our military...
Americans will not be safe as long as Trump is in office. You need to stop him something before he kills us all.

Graham knows full well that 45 is dangerous, but he's just too chicken to do anything about it.
Same to you Senator.
It's humbly to know that we have a Constitutional Guardian in our Senate. Thank you Senator. Our Senate a separate branch of our Government.
For tomorrow you will have no healthcare... you forgot that part Lindsey. #25AmendmentNow
@gop logic: spend limitless on war but allow ppl to die of treatable conditions cause it's too $$ Pentagon lost $13 TRILLION, how patriotic.

thanks Lindsey. Please continue to kick ass in DC
Every day that trump serves put this great nation in exceptionally grave danger, is this the man we want to have meeting with putin?
Wishing evil men and hypocrites like you disappear from US politics for ever, to be replaced by men & women of integrity and sincerity!
Thank u 4 being one of the few Republicans to have courage, stand up & speak out against the prez who brings so much shame to our country.
God bless you sir and thank you for your service
Thank you Senator. Now, if you'll kindly vote NO on that little Healthcare bill up there we would all be much obliged!
You can help make it even happier.

Get rid of the clown in the White House.
GOD BLESS AMERICA..PLEASE SENATOR HELP OUR STATE TO DO THE RIGHT THING . WE NEED MEDICAID AND FOOD STAMPS for seniors $16 for womens food
Sickening we are begging for decency on 4th of July

I want to hear from you,@LindseyGrahamSC.  When will you act? Come on now, man - this is an outrage. Please contact me.
Nothing like fireworks over the Charleston  Harbor!  #sc #Charleston #PalmettoState #Fireworks #HappyBirthdayAmerica #IndependenceDay
Help save our democracy from this kleptocracy!!!
Tell that to our soldiers @potus sent to Iraq to protect oil assets. The war machine is DESTROYING AMERICA. It has to stop. That's patriotic
happy 4th senator


Please forward to our President:
@LindseyGrahamSC thanks for being downrange with our troop in harms way on the 4th. My family enjoying the freedoms they defend
Happy and safe: #25thAmendmentNow #25thAmendment #25thAmendmentNOW
Thank you for your service to America
@LindseyGrahamSC Help  remain blessed! 
I don't agree with all of your positions but my opinion is you are a true American run for president you would get my moderate vote Happy4th
Agree I'm #DemExit @dnc is Dead. We need someone who isn't a monster in the White House. How low have we gone when that's the bar? #impeach
Same to you lindsey
Please do the patriotic thing and put your country over your party. #25thAmendment
Great town
Happy and safe? A spineless party running the show and a bat shit crazy guy leading the lemmings towards the cliff. Oh we're happy and safe.
Wish you were our President. Keep a eye on you know who. Happy 4th.
It would be a lot more safe if you and the rest of the @gop enablers would use the 25th to get the crazy man away from the nukes.
Happy Independence Day, Senator Graham! We are counting on you to keep us safe and secure. 
Right back atcha Mr Lindsey!
Will you guys please stop tweeting. This is our day as Americans not Russians. For the love of god and country, leave us alone for one day.
Happy 4th everyone.  It’s a quaint historical commemoration of a time when we weren’t ruled by a foreign power.
SAVE US!!!
Thank you for spending yours again this year with our wonderful troops. #Happy4th
Come out come out wherever you are! Your country needs you!
We won't be safe until the president+all the presidents men are in jail!Wake up and put country over party!YOU will be a traitor in history!
Thank you Sir. Happy Independence Day to you #GoldStarDad
Safe? With tRUMP in the WH?
Thanks Senator. And a Happy #25Amendment Day to you too!
God bless Senator! You're reason in a field of grifters!
feeling unsafe from WITHIN our government this 4th. how sad is that.
Thank tou
You too! Let's make this the last 4th with Crazy Donnie running things. You know he's a disaster. First step is admitting it.

Would take your wish seriously if you weren't trying to take healthcare from millions but what the hell. Happy July 4th to you too.
dismiss special council. the witch hunt must end. stop obstruction..
Kind of hard to feel safe with a madman in office and NK testing intercontinental missiles, but hey, you, too!!
We'd feel happier and safer with someone else as president. Just sayin'. Otherwise, Happy 4th to you and your family, too.
#Happy4th @LindseyGrahamSC Love my Southern Neighbor #SouthCakalacky
