He looks like the crypt keeper give me a break ..  start thinking about retirement  ..you are all  old and your ideas tired
And you are the most negative TV FaceTime seeker ever! You are out of step with even the lowlyist of Sandlappers! Shameful!
Is vetting Cabinet nominees no longer a step toward ensuring national security? Are U in favor of this fading out of govt.?
he is but one man with his own bias and politic.

shame on you for making fun of law professors opposed to Sessions. #goodoldboysclub
if you ever sabotage president @realDonaldTrump we his supporters won't forgive you. We want good relations with Russia
I'm happy with Coats. It's everyone else but he and Mattis that concern me. Including Putin.
His first cabinet is likely to implode by next August. Who will save Trump then ? Men of character will abandon Trump
Ridiculous! @LindseyGrahamSC
Why is Congress allowing Trump to shrink our National Security Agencies while praising hostile foreign dictators?
<<  What a lie! @LindseyGrahamSC. Get on the #TrumpTrain or get out of the Way!  #MAGA
He is a DJT loyalist b4 country. He has not been vetted-what us he hiding? Why Mitch rushing hearing?
please investigate more this a danger to America Trump choosing Piutin over his own country for profit
Why did the NSA Director only give "moderate confidence" it was Russia? 7 times the size of CIA
Was Donald Trump actually born in Jamaica??
wil u make sure the Federal government has good cyber security for space, national grid & @CDC etc take money from O care 
sir credit to you for your vigilance in the matter. Thank you for choosing our country over party.
Just remember #DanCoats is very familiar w/close to K St lobbyists - many Americans are aware of this fact.
Don't agree with many of your positions, but maybe you could give Our Dear Leader some tweet lessons & teach some manners.
If Republicans really cared about US democracy, they'd be calling for annulment and fresh elections. Just saying.
so why is he talking to you? @SenJohnMcCain

please DO NOT normalize, PE
Here's hoping!
so what's he doing with Trump?
hopefully no sane person would believe anything Lindsey would say, he is a real yoyo.
Will he override Gen Flynn, who I suspect is, along with Trump's fragile ego, at the heart of the denial of facts re hacks?
And you think trump will actually listen to him? C'mon, Senator, we need you to be persistent and not bow down
Except he's never been in intelligence. With Mr. Trump as President, we need more than a nice guy.

Sure hope you are right!  This has all been going in the opposite direction to the point of real "fear" to most Americans.
U THREATEN US, Israel and Pales security by turning a blind eye to Israeli violations of law.
If that were true he would not be embracing a Traitor.
Make your forefathers proud Senator Graham.
yes please apologize to USA and then resign as fast as possible-Take @SenJohnMcCain and UN too Go sell used cars
Trump hires opposites in important roles. He creates chaos in his own offices. Scorpion matches for internal power centres.
let's hope we can trust in that bc the freak show is dangerous. @realDonaldTrump @GenFlynn yep looking at u Yahoo!'s
And if he stands up to Trump on Russia, he will probably quit or get sacked like Mad Dog is about to.
He must be another member of your elitist clubs since you speak so highly of him.
please let me know...
what is Congress' plan to ensure with a 100% degree of certainty that POTUS isn't in violation of the emoluments clause?
You and I both know that he is not one of the most mature or respected voices on anything.
The US Citizens don't live in a dictatorship. We have a constitution. What is your plan to hold Mr. Trump accountable?
Thank you for investigating and believing that the Russians hacked the election.  The President elect is still in doubt!
and if you say this then we know hes in the pot to help your lies.
why is congress allowing Trump to work in collusion with Russia, a nation hostile to the US?
if we allow @FBI, JComey, our own get away with interference in the 2016 election why place sanctions on Russia?  far worst
@ReaganBattalion 8 years of Hacking our Gov why no action?
Wow, 8 years have passed?
Get to defunding @PPact asap!
there you go again undermining the new administration by accusing them of being competent and rational
Good. We will need him in this clown car of an administration. @LindseyGrahamSC
Appears he has favored a tough stance toward Russia. #needed
I don't agree with you on many things but when it comes to our security thank you!
u sir have caused a lot of problems in this country
Ahh go cry me a cup of your dreadful tears Kitty Cat.
I think you are, too, Senator

@LindseyGrahamSC
And hopefully Coats will join you and @SenJohnMcCain in opposing Russian influence at the highest levels of US govt.
Good Friday, Sen.GRAHAM
In other words, he will resign in frustration in six months.
wonderful! Will @realDonaldTrump trust him when he briefs him?!
unfortunately DJT is not a rational man!He's taking this country Down a slippery slope! may have Putin&Assange as advisors
oh that's right everyone's a moron besides u! Got it! U sir r as belligerent as DJT!
But will be stand up for The USA or for Trump & Putin? That is the question.
Thank you for that.  #TerrifiedDem in CA
Yeah, but his boss is a petulant child with thin skin and the attention span of a fruit fly.
