@LindseyGrahamSC Saw you as conscience of GOP as our democracy is under attack by Bannon &.Putin. #Yousoldout
You sir have jumped onto the Trump Traitor Train. Enjoy the ride. Political career is toast with this move.
Had smidge of respect for @LindseyGrahamSC, but no more.  Knuckling under to business interests.
It's shameful how @LindseyGrahamSC et al place party above USA. Examine your conscience. Is it just inconvenient to do right?
@LindseyGrahamSC You caved on Tillerson. You will cave on Putin. You will cave on the rest. I guarantee it.
@LindseyGrahamSC Fall in line! Give up your principles! You are no better than than Hilter's followers. Shame!
@LindseyGrahamSC party over country so wrong and shameful

“The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”
I thought you were a true patriot for the people Sir.Yet you will vote for a man who will sell out to Russia

@LindseyGrahamSC like i said about mccain smh you and he i thought were strong followers . So dissapointed
@LindseyGrahamSC I am so sad that you didn't stick to your guns. In your heart you have to know Tillerson should not be SS.
@LindseyGrahamSC Are you even listening to your constituents?
@LindseyGrahamSC Bah!
Lindsey, you and John are a couple of old white limp dicks, everyone, especially you two, know it.
Please vote against Rex Tillerson today.  Please do what's right for our country and not Big Oil.  Keep the Russian influence out!
@LindseyGrahamSC had hope for you, but now history will remember you as a sellout and enabler
@LindseyGrahamSC We are organizing your release from public service and will vote you out. Country before Party!
Way to cave and support Trumputin. Party before country, your own career before any citizen.

So sorry you can't stand up to 
THE MAN!! We need consciences in Congress.
@LindseyGrahamSC @CynthiaBuckwalt With 500 B you can buy anything and everyone!!
this is not something to be proud of. Please vote country not Exxon Tillerson
Where is the investigation into Russian interference in the election?! This can't be lost in the flood of Trump distractions!
@LindseyGrahamSC Russia loves you wonder what they gave mr graham . I am ashamed of these so called Americans
remember the alternative facts you were given! Report that truth! The alternative truth. The Donald has a big crowd size!
@LindseyGrahamSC Wait..
Didn't you say he wasn't a good choice ?(paraphrasing )
Silly me I thought u were a man of integrity
@LindseyGrahamSC Fantastic job on Face the Nation. Your thinking/statements are on target. You crushed it, as the kids say.
What will you do to combat the lying from the White House?
Don't mind Rome burning in the background, Tilly/Pootie oil spills/fires, ice caps melting, good for piss-on econ til depress
So cute to see traitors decide to let traitors be traitors and smooch like that so publicly. Don, Lin, John, lick away pusses
@LindseyGrahamSC Please Mr Graham VOTE NO ON TILLERSON.
He hold a 500 billion land deal in Russia for oil drilling.No one...
in our government should be in bed with Putin or in Russia. Russia has committed war crimes..Why would a ...
wealthy man like Tillerson want to be in gov? To help his agenda? PLEASE RETHINK THIS AND FOR THE LOVE..
OF OUR GREAT COUNTRY ..DON'T RISK IT WITH TILLERSON PLEASE VOTE NO PLEASEEEE
What a difference a few weeks make, huh Lindsey? I was actually starting to respect you, should've known you'd cave to GOP pressure. #Weak
@LindseyGrahamSC Traitor and coward. You will be voted out now come midterms
Graham says "Money oil,and my friend Putin mean a hell of a lot more than National security"
Fine, fine, whatever. Just approve him.
@LindseyGrahamSC anyone who approves Tillerson or DeVos doesn't have my vote.
How many times have we seen this before? You & McCain make lots of noise & then toe the party line. Same sh#t, different day. #Yawn
@LindseyGrahamSC so how much are they paying you? Add you to the #treason list. #traitor #pathetic #greed #disgraceful
@LindseyGrahamSC Tillerson is too cozy with Russia, please reconsider.
As a democrat, I respected your courage up til now.  So disappointed.  History will remember.
@LindseyGrahamSC Awesome.  Putin's friend as Sec of State & his Puppet as POTUS! Disaster!
@LindseyGrahamSC Russian oil Russian oil Russian oil
@LindseyGrahamSC Nooooooooooooooooooo!  Please Nooooooooooooooooooo!
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenMcCain SHAME on you for selling out America to Big Oil and Russia! RECANT! #ShameOnAmerica 
@LindseyGrahamSC EXACTLY WHY WE DIDN'T ELECT ONE OF THESE POLITICIANS THAT HAVE NO CLUE WHAT THE REAL WORLD OS LIKE #MAGA
@LindseyGrahamSC OK I'LL HELP HIM.. AMERICA FIRST MEANS IF ITS BAD FOR AMERICA OR AMERICANS THEN ITS NOT GONNA HAPPEN STUPUD!
@LindseyGrahamSC Despicable.I had hoped you were a patriot more interested in country than party & $$.Nope. We will remember!
@LindseyGrahamSC You are betraying your country & her people by approving Tillerson knowing his personal connection to Putin
Senator Graham,  I'm really disappointed in you and John McCain. Rex Tillerson has too many conflicts of interest!
@LindseyGrahamSC Very, VERY disappointing, Senator. Please reconsider. Country before party.
@LindseyGrahamSC how can you support this fraudulent president and what he stands for? Shame on you. Not getting our vote
Senator, 'guess I should not be surprised but 'am disappointed, by you.
@LindsayGrahamSC Go on back into the closet Lindsay.  Your mama probably had more balls than you.
@LindseyGrahamSC guess my instincts were indeed right about you. self before country.
@LindseyGrahamSC We know you lost your credibility but have you also lost your mind ?! Were you offered a piece of the pie ?
When Tillerson and Putin have an oil deal in the works to drill in Russia and sanctions lifted why not? SCAM
@LindseyGrahamSC you sold out by voting for Tillerson. Russians and Putin have a friend in Graham. Sad
@LindseyGrahamSC Disappointed but not surprised. You now share the blame for damage Tillerson does at Trump/Putin's behest.
@LindseyGrahamSC  Putin is way smarter than most of us and Trump. DT/Tillman/Putin trying to lift sanc. for that $$$$ CORRUPT
#corrupt #polluter mafia #climate denier Rex Tillerson as Sec of State?  NO! #RejectRex @FaceTheNation @LindseyGrahamSC Fail!
@LindseyGrahamSC who lets this wacko bird on the air?
http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/mccain-graham-will-vote-yes-tillerson-despite-skepticism-n710551?cid=par-twitter-feed_20170122 … Graham has lost my respect. #PartyOverCountry #GoodbyIntegrity
@LindseyGrahamSC JOINING PUTIN?  WHY AREN'T WE SURPRISED?  IT IS THE PARTY FIRST GOP!  NO SURPRISES HERE! OUR   ARE ON YOU!.
@LindseyGrahamSC Is Exxon funding your new superpack?
aka "Not Trump" do better. Do what you know is right. You know Rex is not right. Vote for America tomorrow.
@LindseyGrahamSC So disappointing!
@LindseyGrahamSC no surprise, Lindsey caves to the bully party.
Don't let him bribe you.  TRUMP LIES!
@LindseyGrahamSC Vote AGAINST Rex. We need an honest Republican to stand up to Trump.
TRAITOR!! TRAITOR!! SPINELESS JELLYFISH, simply said you suck, thought you had core convictions, WRONG!!
@LindseyGrahamSC  Please tell your constituents you didn't  really say I don't know what make America first means !!
@LindseyGrahamSC Your support of Tillerson greatly diminishes any respect I had for you.
are you a conservative or a RINO?  Stop spending money you don't have!
@LindseyGrahamSC   Sad! Will not support reelection. Your conviction & courage waned when your nation needed it most.
Such a sell out on our country.  Guess we all need to learn to speak Russian.
@LindseyGrahamSC need some help?
@LindseyGrahamSC RINO should be cautious about his political career!
@LindseyGrahamSC I'm ashamed of you.
@LindseyGrahamSC You sir are spineless!!! You were one of the few last hope, now I hate you
@LindseyGrahamSC  America first means we protect AMERICANS. We house, feed & give jobs to Americans first. Not a hard concept
Graham, you're being two faced by voting for Tillerson...SMH
@LindseyGrahamSC there goes your patriotism for the country. Knowing well that Rex is a medal winning Russian dickrider.
@LindseyGrahamSC  You need help  in maturing past puberty or your just a permanent child. Fade away please.
Don't approve Rex Tilerson as Secretary of State. 
He will continue to divide a divided nation.
@LindseyGrahamSC how much?  How much did you get? What's the going rate for selling out America?
@LindseyGrahamSC we the American ppl are telling you no on Tillerson. We won't forget this!
@JeffreyGoldberg In the end, they will all cave. Power and party over justice and country.
SHAME on you, Disgraceful! Did you forget the $500B contract Exxon has with Putin? http://www.newsweek.com/mccain-graham-back-rex-tillerson-secretary-state-546088 …
st least senator Graham admitted he doesn't understand the American 1st concept lol #DCbubble
You better be 100% sure...the rest of us are not. We are trusting you to keep control of truth, safety & principles.
Money talks BS walks. Bless your heart, @LindseyGrahamSC
Your mailbox is full! Add another! Party over country! Will you also vote for incompetent DeVos?!
@LindseyGrahamSC I suspect your phone lines will be blowing up! How disappointing...
Lindsey Graham is a sale out to the Democrat an Soros party an should keep his mouth shut until he's replaced
@GregMazares Graham should do more to speed up accepts!


@LindseyGrahamSC you are a sell out. Disappointed with all that supports russia. SHAMR!
Alright to support ISIS ,did hear a word during that
@LindseyGrahamSC  wow, this will be remembered when you are up for reelection
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorTimScott So I guess we can depend on you to demand Dear Leader release tax returns? HE PROMISED!!
@LindseyGrahamSC 
Figures.  I remember when Lindsey claimed to be a Gulf War Veteran but was actually flying a desk in SC.
@LindseyGrahamSC Thank You, Senator Graham!
@LindseyGrahamSC You are a total sell out on Tillerson. Thought you had a better moral compass
3.) and sincere and a contrast to Trump. Please remain resolute on the Russian hacking of our democracy.
@LindseyGrahamSC so when sanctions are lifted agInst Russia that will be on you Senator.  COWARD!!!
2.) Tillerson. I don't support him. But, I believe you want to do what is right for the country & the world. U are logical &
1.) Sen Graham I just wtchd this. I've said I wld nvr vote 4 anther R ever. But, I wld vote 4 U, not because of ur stance on
No surprise. We live in an era where everyone capitulates. Term limits would end this embarassing spectacle @LindseyGrahamSC
@LindseyGrahamSC you have just shown that you have no principles-anything to keep the power right?
@LindseyGrahamSC You are spineless! Thought you had more brains than this. I guess you will cave to Putin also!@Gabsterr12
SHow much do YOU get from the $500 BILLION Exxon-RussiaOil merger after Sec. Tillerson lifts the sanctions?
@LindseyGrahamSC so disgusted at your flip flop of views! Sellout!
Cuz you're a sell out to your country.
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC No,Senator. For the American people, do not follow the mean-spirited agenda.
@LindseyGrahamSC this is our NEW WASHINGTON!
that is  Alternative Clothing

@LindseyGrahamSC #coward we are a laughing stock! And the whole world is watching PUTINS control!
@LindseyGrahamSC God forbid we cut state, lets just take health care away from people who will die without it.
@LindseyGrahamSC sooooo beyond disappointed in U! What people Hate in Wash is when your truth, morals & dignity cave to 
@LindseyGrahamSC please don't. Big@pil@is clogging the swamp
@LindseyGrahamSC what a disappointment. Apparently party before America. Here I thought you had courage & ethics #GOP #puppet
@LindseyGrahamSC I thought you were the reasonable one Lindsey.  Guess not.
@LindseyGrahamSC I believed in your principles!  You let us down!  #russianagenda
@LindseyGrahamSC Huge mistake to vote for Tillerson! Aren't you concerned about all his Russian ties? #VoteCountryOverParty
@LindseyGrahamSC All talk no action. You had a chance to lead and instead chose to follow party
@LindseyGrahamSC Disappointed  backing Tillerson. He doesn't have Americans interests at heart. Only concered abt getting oil
@LindseyGrahamSC you too are a TRAITOR. #putiesbooty2
@JeffreyGoldberg would you rather have Rudy or Newt? Pragmatic decision
@LindseyGrahamSC Very bad decision. Especially after the Women's March. You learned nothing so I will vote against you.
@LindseyGrahamSC Do not confirm Tillerson. A vote for him is a vote for Putin.
Trump needs to clarify his position on Russia. Yours is clear, and people appear to agree. #sanctions
@LindseyGrahamSC  please do not support Tillerson. He is not right for our country will cause more distrust
@LindseyGrahamSC so deeply disappointed in u Senator. This is clearly picked 2 help Putin.  
We see it. Shame on u
@BillKristol  Your voice in our government gives us hope, provides crucial "context" for the Trump fiasco
@LindseyGrahamSC disappointed you are not standing up to President Trump.  You had me believing in nonpartisanship for a sec.
@BillKristol Sen Graham, Thanks for your smart remarks today, You're a whole lot more sophisticated than DT
@LindseyGrahamSC great, Graham and McCain complete the sale of America to Putin. Sad day.
@LindseyGrahamSC  BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
@LindseyGrahamSC is wrong. Tillerson will help initiate the impending war in M.E. DT will manufacture.
@LindseyGrahamSC great interview. Clear ideas absent political rhetoric. Why can't you always speak this way?
@sengraham2016, not a good idea to vote Tillerson.  Bad choice for US
@LindseyGrahamSC Was beginning to respect you. Very disappointed. Party before country, huh?
