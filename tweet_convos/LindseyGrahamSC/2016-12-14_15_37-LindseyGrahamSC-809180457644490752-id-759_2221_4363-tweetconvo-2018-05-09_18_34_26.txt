Sen. Lindsey Graham: My goal is to put "crippling sanctions" on Russia 
.@LindseyGrahamSC @JWGOP @CNN
someone finally let a grown up in the room! Hope it lasts.
Lindsey lied about WMD, lied about Syria & now wants war with Russia. Disgrace
oh so now other republicans are bad bc they disagree with you?
Lindsey is NOT a Republican he's a complete fraud.
It is so difficult to understand your values. You are pro-Russia?

.@boogtek @GolfDude2000 @cohenfucius @JWGOP Yeah cool. Why would Wikileaks say who gave them the emails? What do they have to gain?
TRUMP NEEDS TO PAY A PRICE alongside FLYNN, MANAFOR and every single GOP who knew abt hacking & said 'nada'

HRC won the popular vote. I stand by that, fine.
yea if it was up to you California would decide everything for the whole country. 
It Doesn't
So 12% of the country's population just shouldn't have a vote?  That's ridiculous.  Get over California.
didn't say that but so you don't think the other 88% shouldn't matter? We Have Electoral College So Every State Gets A Say..
Every state gets a say whether it's electoral college or popular vote, you understand that, right?
NotExactlyEachState HasDifferentConcernsNotEveryone LivesLikeOverPopulatedCali Had We BeenPlaying4PopVoteWeWould've CampaignThere
@CNN how about having hearings about Trump's involvement with Russia? Maybe sanction against Trump as well
Lindsey lied about WMD, lied about Syria & now wants war with Russia. He's a disgrace.
you really need to vary your responses dude
Why Dude? you don't want to hear the truth?
Hey Dude, aren't you the Dude that got caught ripping ppl off? No wonder you support Lindsey.
and I'm not afraid to use my name and face unlike you- what are you hiding coward
No Roland was caught for stealing from innocent people. literally a thief
WE will still pay the price. WE will still ave an illegitimate sociopathic president. What will you do about THAT?
I fear so. Hope not, fear so. I’m wth Evan McMullin.
@Equality4You we'll see......
@CNN note a lot of democracy in the statement, mister. What about establishing the fact first, and then plead  guilty!
bust his ass
.@LindseyGrahamSC @CNN indeed. Confront putin now rather than later when the stakes might be much higher. Thank you Senator Graham!
@CNN oh, you only got 1% because of Russia. So sorry
@goslarsharrey @CNN
Graham lost his run for president, he needs to be replaved. Him and McCain trys to undermine the constitution, kill jobs,
Bet traitor trump won't sign off on sanctions.
@FaithRubPol @CNN Who knew Lindsey Graham would impress me with integrity.  We live in strange times.
Sorry @LindseyGrahamSC but #RussianHacking is #fakenews

Reverse Hillary's BAD  TRAITOROUS Uranium 1 deal that she was bribed by Frank Giustra through Bill Clinton to approve!
Well....he refused to implement. So...what are you going to do? Just take it and say "meh"? Or are you going to do your job?
Thank you for standing up!
The Democrats love Lindsey Graham. Read this Wikileaks email
@FaithRubPol @CNN about time someone did something!
why? If you have proof, let's see it.
If you are eager to expose weak leadership against Russia, publicly test Mr. Trump's reactions to your sanctions now.
Senator? About those Russian sanctions? I did warn you five weeks ago not to trust him.
believe it when I see them.
yeah, hurt as many people as you can, it's all you are good for.
Trump's tax returns will reveal that this will never happen.  Russian banks + Russian investors...Trump is in deep!
@CNN Yes. This cant be partisan-please drive this aggressively.
.@LindseyGrahamSC #Canadian journo totally crushes #MSM reporter on what’s actually going on in #Syria #Aleppo  Pt 1
Good play.  To NatSec, EVERYTHING is secondary.
@ibarra_lisa @CNN Is Putin and Russia wanting Mr. naive DONALD TRUMP to "kiss their ass" I hate to say it that way
Reverse Hillary's BAD Uranium 1 deal that she was bribed by Frank Giustra through Bill Clinton to approve when she was SOS.
What about US hacking + worldwide NSA surveillance incl. of friendly heads of States hm? Does US "need to pay a price too"?
please let me know when you feel that strongly about DHS hacking GA election database, fraud by DNC, MSM collusion w/HRC
Yes, make Trump show his hand. Please be ready to fight for this needed sanction.Its outrageous that they hacked like this
.@LindseyGrahamSC Americans' goal is to put on PresidentTrump's desk indictments against HRC for corruption & war crimes. #DrainTheSwamp
go away Russian
I am an American voter, NOT a Neocon racist globalist Russophobic warmonger
Thanks from Charleston. Putin doesn't not need a green light to interfere with elections and domestic policy.
hooray! you are a true patriot.
Thank you,Senator @LindseyGrahamSC
@CNN Lindsey, are you prepared to impeach if he won't do It?
@CNN My goal is Trump not be president. Who wants a president the Russians helped elect. Trump can't be trusted.
Sir, please heed these words. We cannot let history repeat itself.
History repeating like Roosevelt creating war. Like Johnson creating war. Like Obama creating war. Hillary...
@CNN How about a full investigation of Trump!
--Hello to Sen. Greyham, and is he offering official or personal services in return for payment from Russia?
Probably worth  investigating...
You have given us hope as veterans Thank YOU
but Trump is Putins puppet . good luck with that.
Your goal, along with McCain, is to try and put President Trump in a harp spot.  You are trying to discredit Pres. Trump.
you've seemed to pull your head out of your ass, but you took an explicit role in creating the climate for Trump to thrive.
Senator Graham, with all due respect, Trump is Pudin's puppet. Look at his choice for Secretary of State.
Uncover the truth, whatever it may be. Too dangerous to allow denials without any investigation by anyone, even the PEOTUS!
Where's the investigation into Trumps ties with Russia or maybe after the inauguration
Now you sound as "weak" as you claim Pres. Obama to be. You know damn well Trump isn't going for that because he's w/Putin.
@CNN go home neocon your drunk
Yes, let's ask Benedict Arnold to negotiate tough with the 18 century British too.
@Bebes_Scrubs @CNN sorry Lindsey but your quisling fellow congressmen would rather have power.
@baileelee @CNN great idea, thank you, but good luck getting that signed
you might have more success sliding in his dm's or maybe leaving the sanctions in a yelp review
@baileelee @CNN Appreciate this, but please also FULLY investigate. Flynn, Manafort, Tillerson, Trump ties all look fishy.
How about putting #CountryOverParty & preventing POTUS Trump? He's already stuck in Putin's web, don't expect him to do it.
How about putting #CountryOverParty & stopping him from becoming President? He is deeply compromised & Putin's puppet.
Thank you, Senator Graham. @brianklaas @CNN
Go for it, Senator. You're right. @Number10gov should offer fullest support too.
@CNN thank you, Senator
@CNN   Smart! Create a rift where none need exist. FBI says they are not involved. All this to delegitimization Trump?
@CNN thank you for being a voice of reason and understanding this threat
What did you say when Obama ordered Angela Merkel's phone tapped?  It's a 2-way street.
Should the U.S. have paid a price for tapping Angela Merkel's phone and other world leaders?  #Irony
You had nothing negative to say about Obama when he ordered NSA to tap Angela Merkel's phone.
@LouiseMensch @CNN pay a price for exposing corruption in the Podesta emails? We thought Seth rich murdered by DNC got them
@LouiseMensch just pledge your allegiance to the Kremlin and shut up. Hail Trump and Putin, world leaders. #TeamTakeOver
absolutely!
@anneapplebaum Well, you'll need 2/3 veto override. Taking health care from 20M ppl won't build bridges.
@CNN you are an embarrassment to my home state. Please do our country a favor a and retire. More sanctions=more war
@yashar You will not do it. Republicans will stop you.
@LouiseMensch @CNN please get a Veto proof majority! #TreasonousTrump #impeachMitch
@LouiseMensch @CNN hallelujah a real conservative god bless Lindsey graham.
@CNN  but they all want to do business in  Russia
Keep that goal Lindsey. You will definitely call his bluff. Show his true colors with Putin. #LindseyGraham
@anneapplebaum @CNN don't be silly.  They know what there doing,
@winterthur Right, wise guy, like Tillerson, Flynn, and Ivanka would let Trump sign measures opposing Putin. #RESISTANCE
And you think that Trump is going to sign sanctions against the man who got him elected?  Really?
.@LindseyGrahamSC Obama's desk would seem a more likely place to find the pen needed for that.
You're going to put sanctions against Russia on the desk of the man Russian helped get elected? Good luck with that.
@CNN Ruble 63 to  Russian GDP 12th 170 mil ppl Australia 23 m almost same Russia is economically crippled What's next?
@anneapplebaum @CNN 
Ok so that's one GOP senator...where are the rest?
good luck, crooked media will change message, normalize soon,TrumpsRussian vodka gift bags will hit cnn, fox, cbs, abc,nbc
ohhhh I bet pooty Poot is shaking in his boots. @CNN
got it...those who sell bombs & bullets fund your campaign....check
If Trump doesn't sign it you'd better have the votes to override him.
Thank you Senator Graham
@CNN you cannot possibly be so naive as to think he'll do that.
@Steven_Strauss "President" Trump will piss on it cuz your president is a Russian Manchurian candidate
@CNN I may not always agree with your politics but thanks for being one of the very few patriots on your side of the aisle
NOW, lets see you put your money where your mouth is...Chicken !!
I will believe it when I see I.   And when Trump vetoes it?   What then?
@CNN listen loser, the US has been interfering in foreign elections for dozens of years.
And, he will do nothing.
@CNN But 2 ensure legitimacy, the #ElectoralCollege needs 2 pick:
-@Evan_McMullin
-@MittRomney
-@SenJohnMcCain
-@JoeBiden
why would trump sign a bill that would hurt his benefactor?
@52fairway @CNN 
We the American people are not stupid. We discerned the content of the hacked email. This is BS.
SenGraham u are overlooking that #Trump is on #Russia's side, not the side of the USA. #UNeedDiffStrategy
@supertaschablue good!  And good luck!
Lindsey, you needed to speak out on this months ago.
He and his Secretary of State might not like that too much.
@CNN That'll never happen
And then Trump will slide those sanction recommendations off his desk into the wastebasket.
won't happen as they are best buds..
he will never sign it.. He wants to lift sanctions. already has ppl over there
So you are putting that on the desk of a Russian Operative, how does that help America? GOP = Laughable.
.@LindseyGrahamSC
Please do something to STOP #Trump, #Putin & the new radical #GOP. They're destroying the country slowly before our eyes.
What a coincidence-the goal of sane Americans is to put crippling sanctions on "President" Trump.
@CNN so why elect trump?
.@LindseyGrahamSC #PutinDidIt
.@DiamondandSilk discuss Media Bias, Fake News and The Russia Hack. Who will the left blame next?? Ghost, Hijackers, ISIS or Global Warming! 
Why are you letting Putin determine our next President?  Why aren't you challenging validity of the vote? @LindseyGrahamSC @frankdugan
I'm proud of you!
That's the way to go!
@marlene116 @CNN can trump just removed those once in office?
@CNN That's too late, Senator!  Let's get some action on this NOW
We need to support #HamiltonElectors. I will be in Tallahassee.
But PE supports Putin. He will not support sanctions or sanctions of any support.  He and Tillerson will lift sanctions
You @LindseyGrahamSC have better make the vote VETO proof as #Trump will side with #Russia / #Putin who installed him. #GOP @BostonBoomer
but surely he won't agree to them
@CNN 
and the second party to this crime? What's your plan? Jail or presidency?
trump represents GOP. GOP need PUNISHMENT!
@CNN Hey @LindseyGrahamSC ! MY GOAL (& those who voted for TRUE PEOTUS) is NOT to have @realDonaldTrump POTUS in 2017!!
@CNN Really? I don't believe the Republicans have ever had the ability 2 show political courage. Empty suits! @jimmy_dore
@CNN you can put them there, but he'll ignore them.
thank you senator for leading the charge
Looks like Anonymous has info on Trump/Russia, too.
Totally agee with you.  Interference in another countries election process is UNACCEPTABLE!!!!!!!!!
Trump needs to pay a price.
Not President...never. He takes office and this country WILL NEVER RECOVER!
Isn't he filling cabinet with Pro-Putin people? Do you really think Trump will sign? Sounds like Putin will manipulate him
NO IT WASN’T THE RUSSIANS. THE GOVERNMENT IS LYING.
Senator, I have to confess that I have a sneaking feeling you're running a false flag operation here regarding Russia.
@summerbrennan I don't think the Senator understands who he's working for starting next January.
@CNN and if trump was involved?
@CNN This is kind of leadership we need on issues if this level of importance. America first, political parties second!
@CNN . Not only to Russia, also to @GOP members who are looking other way just because want Power
Good luck with that.
@SheWhoVotes ur goal should be 2 take a stand against treason. Country b4 party. trump isnt prez. #IllegitimateElection
@CNN So, what have you been doing for the past 8 years?
I'm with you Senator.
Are u kidding, Lindsey? Do something now or stale breadlines for u. @SouthernRock3 @CNN
Agree. Stop talking about yourself. It's not about you, Lindsey.
I disagree with you on many ideas but I am blown away by the principled integrity you are showing in this. Thank you
My goal is to never speak the words president & Trump together!
@SansaRising @CNN this is #Fakenews #McCarthyism #redscare and a bunch of bullshit lies!
Good luck with that happening when Trump is sworn in.
we all stand with you on this...but what happens when @realDonaldTrump refuses to sign it and continues to protect Putin?
@CNN Best of luck on the effort but we doubt Trump will want to anger his buddy Putin. Bad for Trump investments in Russia.
No, sir. We, the people, are the ones paying the price.
@CNN SO DOES TRUMP!!!!! He needs to pay the price as well!! The election was tampered with and he KNEW&ASKED for it!!
Total Stiff, he couldn't get a job in the private sector! @LindseyGrahamSC
@CNN You sic 'em Mr.Graham! He needs to be stopped. #GratefulinSC #TreasonousTrump
stop him before he has the nuclear codes! Please! American children deserve a future!
@CNN Treasonous #PutinPuppet Is Not The President @LindseyGrahamSC go stuff yourself, you lunatic promoter!
yeah I wouldn't count on Trump authorizing any sanctions against Russia. I hope you know that.
 #fool
That would be a start. Very disappointed in the GOP in general for not standing up & making Trump behave like #peotus
@brianklaas @CNN 
He can put stuff on his desk, but the Trumpster won't read it.
He's too smart.
why would their puppet sanction them?
@CNN didn't Assange say his source was not Russia or any state
He's not going to go for it. He's indebted to him somehow He's playing for THEIR team. @lindapblue
It is suspicious, but he was hacked too. Who knows what dirt they have on GOP. http://www.newsobserver.com/news/nation-world/national/article120979468.html …
All the more reason Trump should be against it. Glaringly obvious something is horribly wrong that he ISNT @LindseyGrahamSC
You really think he'll go for biting the hand that fed him?
.@LindseyGrahamSC are you kidding? He's been compromised just like the rest of his cabinet. Maybe they have kompromat on you too?
@Deemoney521 @CNN please don't give up this fight.
@LoriSums @CNN why would trump go after his Russian friends?
I appreciate your standing up to this. But my goal is to never ever say President Trump - don't say it til you have to
You go Sen Graham!
@JLaeurBlatz @CNN and you trust Trump with that?
How 'bout crippling sanction of not letting Comrade Trump be American POTUS? Only acceptable sanction.
@CNN Thank you!!!
@7bugglettes 
Good idea but Trump won't sign them.
@davidfrum whoa!  Bite the hand that fed him!?!
Bravo!!!
@SenWarren & @SenMarkey, if you can't partner with @LindseyGrahamSC the then we are hopeless. Americanism is not bipartisan @davidfrum @CNN
@KingSalman Puppet @LindseyGrahamSC Claim 2B Christian- AnotherLie- JustLike #Libya #Syria #Russia * #SouthernBaptist #AFPAA #AirForceTimes
But why should WE the American people pay a price too??  And we sure as hell will with this idiot as president.
@wbtphdjd @CNN Keep plugging. Your integrity is appreciated.
