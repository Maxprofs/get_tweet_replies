Start listening to Americans, not the insurance industry! Universal health care for all Americans!
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup Fix, don't repeal.  And dont spend $9 billion  to repeal without a better plan.
This is not true and you know it! Millions of people rely on Obamacare and U are trying to steal it! Freak!
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup wrong you will face huge backlash if you repeal. Shame!
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup didn't you also say that Social Security is a drain on the national debt? LOL .. just stop embarrassed 4 u
We don't want it replaced we want a full repeal, u should not do health care, u do not understand.
8 in 10 Americans don't know that the ACA is Obamacare.
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup how many people who have health ins becuz of #Obamacare want it changed? It's the only reason I am insured
, and seven out of ten want universal single-payer healthcare.  Why?  It is proven to be way cheaper.
In both options.. it is replaced with "SOMETHING". What are you proposing? ....crickets..
So how many want change and how many want it replaced? 99% want improvements maybe?
True however less than half wan't it repealled or weakened as your party desires.
Beware the Canadian experience. Medicare is helping many, but failing many as well.
ACA works great in states that are not hostile to it!  Thanks for asking American citizens!
Yup, we don't need no stinkin insurance.
then raise taxes because #trumpcare will fail miserably.  Good luck in the next election
Is there an actual link to the post.  Did you make sure to tell the people that Obamacare = ACA?
So change it. Don't repeal.
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup thank for potential $116 billion a year due to your inaction of repeal and no plans.  Guess a tax increase
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup
...and want you to leave...
BS
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup More alternative facts, Mitchy boy!
Take a long look at the Canadian experience. Follow @DrBrianDay who is fighting the system
count me as one and my husband as two more
BIG LIE. BIG LIE.
no we want it repealed completely!!!
@senatemajldr no. 26% of Americans. NOT 8 out of 10. The overwhelming majority wants it kept, expanded and fixed
What polls r u looking at?  Don't waste our taxpayer money & build on it. Election Day will be coming up again!
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup Why dont you ask Canada how they do it?or othet countries where healthcare is a right to it's people??
I'm one of those 8 out of 10 Americans, @SenateGOP. I want #Obamacare replaced with single payer health care. No less.
Single payer would be great,  but OMG, we can't do that...that would be socialized medicine!!
Blatantly FALSE LIE, poll said 80% wanted to keep ACA/ObamaCare, 20% against. Your soul is charred black before flames of hell even take it!
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup yes! I am one of those eight Americans. Replace with a single-payer system!
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup so change it. Only 1 in 10 want repeal. You have no option.
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup provide the link 2 the poll.
#ACA saved my life due 2 preexisting condition that allowed me 2 get insurance
That is. Not true and you know it. Will Republicans ever stop posting lies?
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup Maybe if you had a replacement plan we'd be discussing that instead #MakeAmericaSickAgain is NOT a solution
@SenateMajLdr For 7th year in a row, less than 20% of Americans approved the job that Congress is doing http://on.gallup.com/2hIZvvK 
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup tweek it don't take it away
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup but WHO would bribe you then?
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup u wld see to it that industries who benefit don't RUN the governing agencies and enforce price gouging laws
Proverbs 14:31 Whoever oppresses a poor man insults his Maker, but he who is generous to the needy honors him.
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup and u would pay for your own healthcare and get off taxpayer WELFARE
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup if there was a shred of decency or 1 moral fiber stretched among GOP hypocrites u would be on min wage
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup cheating, lying, greedy, soulless pigs who dgaf about Americans are going to ramrod this to get back @obama
True...we want single payer NOW!  Will you actually do something this time, or sit on your dead fat asses?
@SenateMajLdr Care or No Care. What a choice!
NO to REPLACE.  Govt off backs of America.  Free Market healthcare.  $$ to States for Medicaid.
I'm going to keep tweeting, emailing and leaving this voice mail for my Rep...Medicare for ALL+you will be heroes 4 once.
Americans want conservative gov's to quit withholding subsidies in their states. States w subsidies enjoy significant choice at cheap rate
here's another stat for you:https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/01/06/only-1-in-5-americans-supports-republicans-repeal-and-delay-obamacare-strategy/?utm_term=.5cd214e4cc84 … #indivisibletwitterstorm #buckleupbuttercup
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup lie
is that a private poll known only to republicans? you are as big a liar as your leader herr donnie the tiny
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup Show Americans where you are getting these Stats Trump U?
this is big pharma talking - 8 out of 10 peeps want to pay outrageous healthcare cost -doesn't make sense
for yrs peeps complained of increasing healthcare and prescription cost but U say peeps don't want to be covered #shutup
Cherry-picking. 82 % don't want to see Obamacare repealed. You lie!
Because of 7 yrs of lies by GOP & the damage they did to ACA
You're quite adept at lies aren't you little man .
@charles_gaba  Hey Gallup, they forgot something, like what the poll results were! http://www.gallup.com/poll/198158/americans-changes-affordable-care-act.aspx …
"significantly change" can also mean "beef up subsidies, add a public option, etc..."
.@SenateGOP @Gallup americans also wanted hillary clinton as our president but you didnt give a fuck about our opinion on that
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup ummm no they dont.
That is a complete LIE.
Fast and easy with those numbers, ain't'cha?
Fine, repeal & replace ACA ... with Single Payer Medicare for ALL! Removing state lines is very bad idea!
From a politicians point yes but from a business prospective it's a good idea.
I would think a taxpayers perspective would be more important than a business owners, yes?
Tough decisions need to be made & we have to trust who we elect to deliver.
@janeface15 @Gallup  You guys really do lie like a house on fire. If you love Jesus like you claim, stop being lying hypocrites.
Only if you use the word Obamacare. If you ask about healthcare features, the numbers flip. Shame on you. #TheResistance
THIS IS A BALD FACED LIE. THE GOP ARE EXPERTS AT LYING. ALWAYS HAVE BEEN. HAVEN'T BEEN WORTH SPIT FOR DECADES.
LIARS.. state the real numbers.
More than 3/4's of the country didn't vote for Trump. A lot of Trump voters have it an need the ACA too. You're creating a crisis
No idea where they got these numbers! Magic hat tricks.
Isn't there a significant difference between wanting change (including enhancement and extension) and wanting abolition?
@HouseGOP You are liars!
Inaccurate, but whatevs. Then there's this:
If the alternative is to have the same healthcare plan as the Senate does, then it's probably 10 out of 10
LIE.
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup Change it. But don't leave millions of people w/o healthcare. Make it better. You've had 7 years to plan.
We want #UniversalHealthcare.

DO IT.
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup that's a lie and you know it!
this is an outright lie. See you are keeping up your legacy of misinformation and lies. @Gallup #ACA #ItWorks
LIARS
Polls can be wrong.
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup #NoTheyDon't Stop obstructing, vote for changes that work, privatization NEVER helps Joe Public, only 1%ers
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup Absolute nonsense!
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup You are public servant to ALL the people. Not just come.
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup Fix the issues No repeal. Stop dragging the American people through your personal agendas.
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup 
10 of 10 Americans want single payer. Most health ins co hire non medical ppl, who deny apprvl of MD care
Not true! Why are you evil money grubbers so awful? If you want to make ACA better, come up with a plan! Until then, stop
Stop lying. U have no replacement plan that covers same people for similar or lower cost. Medicare for all!
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup  But since Chuck Schumer wants to keep it, we keep it.  Right?
"8 in 10 Americans WANT #Obamacare ." FTFY. See @MarshaBlackburn twitter feed for proof.
WRONG. Gallup also said CLINTON was WINNING.
Help us. Don't screw us.
@SenateMajLdr this was a plan from Heritage Foundation, Romney used it in Massachusetts, you sat back and obstructed, now you fix
Neat how you ignore THIS poll. http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/312674-gop-reps-twitter-poll-doesnt-go-as-planned …
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup so your answer is to add another $9 trillion to the national debt?
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup where is ur plan and will the American people think ur plan will be better?
Let's see the GOP PLAN Mr. McConnell. Get off Twitter and do it, sir!
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup changed only for a better program
22M Americans are enjoying access to healthcare for the first time, thanks to the ACA.
Please do not repeal the ACA leaving over 20 million Americans uninsured. Many have pre existing conditions
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup wrong!As a senator u should have an open mind and work on solutions to Ocare in an effort to make it better
All you have to do is listen to Dems rhetoric and you see they ignore facts
You haven't held up your part of the deal and so premiums went up. Get politics out of this and do your job to protect.
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup LIE!!  why should we believe anything you say.
That is BS.  20 Million people previously w/o insurance have it today. This is the face of ACA.
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup Not True Fake News
Most Americans want cost of healthcare to go down or not pay for it, not repeal #Obamacare!Make it cheaper!
Probably true but once they see what they have lost AFTER its gone there WILL be a public outcry!!!
Replace w/single payer health care! Don't repeal until you have something better. How about the same insurance you have?
@SenateMajLdr @Gallup NO SENATORS,,YOU SAID REPEALED PRONTO! No wiggle room,,,ALL AMERICANS knew it needed to be tweaked.
Please focus on #ReplacementBeforeRepeal.  We don't need question marks after the repeal.
Where is your reference to this that AMERICANS also want? http://www.gallup.com/poll/191504/majority-support-idea-fed-funded-healthcare-system.aspx …
This is a lie. Only 26% of Americans want the law replaced. 49% want the law EXPANDED or left unchanged.
Such freaking liars. You want to kill poor people. You r hated & will be replaced. You started this war, we'll finish it.
if this is true, do it before mid terms. I dare you! 
Yes: Repeal & replace with #MedicareForAll! So simple. More efficient, more economical, everyone pays their share.
#MedicareForAll & everyone should be in just like in social security; ppl who want a fancy plan can pay for supplmt ins.
10 IN 10 AMERICANS
WANT YOU TO SIGNIFICANTLY STOP TRYING TO KILL THEM
10  IN  10  AMERICANS
DON'T WANT YOU TO KILL THEM
Replaced with what specifically, Bubbas?
#Obamacare #Obama #government #Trump #Democrats #Republicans
#Obamacare #Obama #government
Poll only those who R on PrivateMarket-who were screwed b4 ACA-& now have coverage.Employer covered folks don't get a say
... they want "It" ... right!
Come on @SenateGOP we all saw @Gallup polls for the election and how right they where. So let's trust them now right.
you should put the country's interest before your political party's.    For Shame!
your definition of an American, one who earns more than million a year.
not exactly, in fact not at all.
The only replacement I will accept is a single payer system.
No we don't. The GOP wants it repealed, because they want a system they can take credit for. Period.
Huh according to your twitter poll this would be false #WhyImarch
kill Obamacare!!!!!!

do you know what the truth is? ALL you do is lie. This is NOT what gallup shows.

STOP LYING

r u kidding, Trump himself is one big lie. He believes his own lies, cause he is brain dead!
@SenShelby Improve ACA or replace with something better, but otherwise leave it alone. Don't be a death panel.
yes, please replace with single-payer
were you looking at this poll where most prefer to #fixnotnix? Why do you lie & distort?
it's misleading that you don't quote how few Americans actually want repeal. It's only 2 out of 10 who want repeal
Can't believe that as the greatest country in the world we are screwing around playing small ball arguing over healthcare
this is a total lie!
I don't see here where it says "repeal" before finding a solution.
yep, I want to replace Obamacare with Medicare for all single payer. Thank you for listening.
replace by adding g the public option.let people have the choice to buy into medicare
go ahead and repeal! We will see you in 2018. Or not.
This is a lie. Stop the lies to fulfill your agenda. It needs to be improved or expanded. Don't sentence 30M ppl to death
what a dishonest tweet. I want Obamacare changed, but I want a public option. You criminals aren't going to provide that
quit lying.
misleading! you're treating your constituents like idiots. those who want change don't want their healthcare in jeopardy.
Reform requires courage, integrity and fearlessness, maintaining the status quo only requires cowardice.
didnt expect so many negative reactions from Americans, did you. We are not going to take it anymore. Put up or  shut up!
This does not correspond with any previous polls. Must be a lie.
Yes, 'significantly change' = for it to become single payer
@SenShelby @Gallup No repeal of ACA UNTIL there is a better plan to replace. Millions would suffer if repealed without replacing
well another poll that is wrong.


Another lie. Only 26% of Americans want the law replaced. 49% want the law EXPANDED or left unchanged.
That is, in fact, a lie. Polls indicate most Americans want expansion and improvement.
you didn't read this did you?
If you guys are going to flood us with alt-right white nationalist ideology, at least learn how to read a goddamn poll. Sheesh.
CHANGED/REPLACE IS NOT THE SAME AS REPEALING. We want the mandate for private insurance off and closer to public option.
Uh, ur lying. How's that approval rating doing?
GOP successfully sold 8 years of recovery as failure. Total Orwellian bullshit.
@SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr pass legislation to fix ACA. Don't take insurance away from 20 million people
Fake propaganda.  Not one of you would forfeit your health care.
This is disingenuous to say the least. How about you plutocrats give up your TAXPAYER FUNDED, gold-plated insurance, hmm?
please site the poll used as your source. Anyone can make a picture and you aren't known. For being truthful.
You fascists simply want to eliminate it. "8 in 10" don't agree with your fascism, so flush it. http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/12/01/more-americans-support-obamacare-post-election-poll-shows/ …
who are these people? Hyperbole!
This is a lie. Stop lying to us #TheResistance #resist
it was based on lies...needs to be replaced
You, specifically Ryan withheld $2.5B for high risk pools from Obamacare coops, forcing premiums 2 rise before election!
Hey Senate R's, your analysis is a lie! Your numbers are deceiving & incorrect!! Stop lying to the American people!
You lie and lie and lie
Love Obamacare
Majority happy w/"Obamacare" but want it EXPANDED or REPLACED with SINGLE PAYER
Even GOP's
But you know that
These clowns aren't very good with numbers. Majority want the law IMPROVED not repealed. GOP has NO plan
You lie, lie, lie 
Why do you hate America and Americans.??
another LIE. Ur constituents in red states are all under #ACA .  They'll remember your actions 2018. u break it u own it.
I believe you mean 8 out of 10 Republicans not all Americans
@SenShelby @Gallup but how do they want it changed? Some may want universal coverage. Bad question #misleading result
lie lie lie! 26% want it. Facts matter!
Another falsification from the current party of billionaires and lies.
Yeah, just ask @MarshaBlackburn she found out that 75% of her constituents wanted to improve Obamacare! Stop Lying!
Go ahead and come up with a plan to replace it so we can evaluate it.  So far the GOP has offered nothing but empty promises.

Yes. A lot of people want it improved.  A lot want it replaced with single payer.  Relatively few want it repealed.
