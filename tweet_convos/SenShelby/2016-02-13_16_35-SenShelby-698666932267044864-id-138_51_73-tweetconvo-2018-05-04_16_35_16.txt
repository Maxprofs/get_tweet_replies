it's not racist for republicans to oppose the president's nominee before they know who he/she is. it's just.. I've got nothing RT @SenShelby
@moneyman10k I don't think racism is necessary to explain this. Do you think they'd act differently if the POTUS were a white male democrat?
@rocketrepreneur the republican status quo is teaching me entirely new ways to behave, so I don't know what to believe
@moneyman10k I wouldn't attribute racism when partisan politics explains things well enough.
@Robotbeat @moneyman10k Insinuating racist motivations w/o evidence is intellectually lazy and doesn't help the cause of racial harmony.
@Robotbeat @moneyman10k so you honestly think the GOP reaction to Scalia's death is racially motivated?
@SenShelby JUST like the LAST two Affirmative Action INCOMPETENTS he appointed. HE tells them how to vote and they do it.
@SenShelby @SenateMajLdr   #NoHearingsNoVotes
@SenShelby Gosh Senator you were a Democrat for many decades before changing coat. Have you had a permanent hot flash ?
@SenShelby You're a hypocrite. If he had died while a republican was in office, you'd be screaming for the seat to be filled NOW.
@Carsoniman @SenShelby And every democrat in the house/senate would be all over the news "defying" the Constitution by threatening to block.
@SgtJForr @SenShelby You are correct, but that doesn't mean that it should be done.
@Carsoniman @SenShelby Personal bias aside, you're right. But, I hope they stop it. Agree to disagree.
@SenShelby, why would you adamantly block @POTUS constitutional right to nominate a new @Scotus w/o knowing the merit of his nominee?
@SenShelby Why R U so eager to undermine the U.S. Constitution? U seem quite self-serving.
@SenShelby a president is elected for a 4 year term so he gets to do it and you should retire
@SenShelby please sir!!! I am from Alabama! But live in comifornia now you guys are our last hope!!!
@SenShelby  This Republican Congress is OUT OF CONTROL. Why was it ok for Reagan to appoint a justice in his last yr but not Obama?GOPcheats
@SenShelby that's why I will vote for you again!
@SenShelby  Republicans like yourself  believe in the constitution like they believe in the bible... Only when it benefits them...
@SenShelby and you sir should be impeached for obstructing the constitution
@SenShelby That is NOT how the "balance of powers" is supposed to work. EVERYTHING he does is unconstitutional and/or ILLEGAL.
@SenShelby This is exactly the kind of disgraceful conduct that we the people are so sick of.
@SenShelby no reason to have a Supreme Court of 8 members for a year
. Do your duty as elected congressman,support replacing the late member
@SenShelby I adamantly oppose your opposition to Obama nominating a successor to the Supreme Court.
@SenShelby why??? Because he's the most powerful black man in this country. And you are intimidated and envious oh his power...
@senshelby #DISGRACE to #PUBLIC SERVICE!!..Only in #ALABAMA would this amount of BLATANT disregard for our PRESIDENT be TOLERATED!!..
.@SenShelby Thank you Senator! #honorscaliabyrememberingbork #scotus #scaliadeath #ScaliaRIP #scalia #friends #lettheborkingbegin.
@SenShelby => We pay you a lot of money, and you refuse to do your job. Time to vote you out!
@SenShelby Contempt prior to investigation.
For Alabama voters, this is a must read! Time for @SenShelby to go bye, bye 
#Election2016
@SenShelby Why are you even weighing in, Senator? Your seat is up for re-election too.
@SenShelby Sounds like you OPPOSE the Constitution of the United States of America.  Such a stance is not worthy of a U.S. Senator. #Shame
@SenShelby You lose.
@SenShelby thank you!
@SenShelby So U believe U can just make up new rules that a Pres cant even attempt to fill such a vacancy? U damn our Constitution? Treason!
@SenShelby Remember you voted to confirm Anthony Kennedy in 1988. #hypocrisy
@SenShelby In other words, yet again, the Republican-controlled Senate shits on the Constitution whilst claiming to defend it.
@SenShelby Good for YOU! You know he is watering at the mouth to appoint another STOOGE more loyal to HIM than to Constitution!
@SenShelby precedent dictates the vacant seat be filled as soon as possible. #Scalia himself would want regardless of party.
@SenShelby thank you sir!  You have my vote!
@SenShelby SO McConnell & senate in FEB 1988 were acting badly when lame duck Reagan nominated Kennedy and he was confirmed?
@SenShelby This is the exact definition of obstructionism. You, Sir, are derelect in the duties of your office
@SenShelby 

You see Dick, we can't always have things our way. As with the #GOP Presidential candidates, whining and crying doesn't work.
@SenShelby  #BLM #Latino 

Awesome. #America gets to see the vile political nature of the republican Senate during a Presidential campaign.
@SenShelby That's why Senator Congres is held in such low esteem.....and you are the perfect epitomy of it...hope you're not offended.....
@SenShelby your commercial is looping on Comedy Central right now over and over, keeping us safe
@SenShelby Do something useful and oppose TPP and support food labeling #JustLabelIt #NODARKAct #NoTPP
@SenShelby It's time you heard it directly from us. http://www.contactsenators.com/alabama/richard-shelby … (251)694-4164 (202)224-5744
@SenShelby why? Because you refuse to cooperate?
@SenShelby I am so disgusted with your racist representation of Alabama in the US Senate. Change before ur #BadKarma gets you too. Or, not.
.@SenShelby, here's a list -- http://www.vox.com/2016/2/13/10987836/obama-supreme-court-shortlist …. let's hear your reasoning, since you ignorantly oppose based on blind-hatred alone.
@SenShelby Now that's a shocker. #AssHat
@SenShelby Good Lord, why tweet this much ignorance?
@SenShelby Justice Scalia's seat should be nominated by the new President.
@SenShelby sigh. Stop using someone's death to try to gain votes.
@SenShelby then you, sir, should resign if you are refusing to do your job. Go get a real job & try that shit. #fired
@SenShelby Atta boy!  Way to show the American People how important a functioning government is. Stop being a jerk.
@SenShelby Constitution My A**, right Senator?
@SenShelby Why should this occupancy be different than any other occupancy he's tried to fill? That's all you do.
@SenShelby Why would you? Congress hasn't done ANYTHING in the last 8 years, why start now?
@SenShelby if you are not willing to provide a nominee a fair hearing, as is your sworn constitutional responsibility, you should resign
@SenShelby says, "I will adamantly oppose any expectations to fulfill my constitutional obligation. And I will be a total dick about it."
.@SenShelby So you work for the Koch Brothers and not the fine people of Alabama and America? You want gridlock on the Supreme Court?
@SenShelby It's your job to debate and consider actual nominees.
@SenShelby you have a sworn duty to uphold the constitution - DO YOUR JOB
@SenShelby Sure,why should end-of-term b any different from O's entire time in office?
Gahd,you're an embarrassment 2 politicians AND whites
@SenShelby The Constitution seems to only matters when its beneficial to your party.
@SenShelby In 1988 Reagan appointed Anthony Kennedy in his last year of office. So it’s okay for Saint Reagan but not President Obama?
@SenShelby @setislady It's your job. Do your job. Pretty simple stuff.
@SenShelby Why do you hate the Constitution?
@SenShelby Obstructionism is unbecoming
@SenShelby Then resign.@POTUS is obligated to make an appointment, and the Senate is obligated to give his nominee a fair hearing and vote.
@SenShelby Why do you hate America by pledging to violate the Constitution and your Oath? #disgrace
.@SenShelby   So much for the #Constitution, eh Senator Shelby?   And you call yourself a #patriot?  That's laughable. #GOP #tcot
@SenShelby hey, thanks for blocking progress yet again.
@SenShelby Oh dear. Why don't you earn the hefty salary the taxpayers supply you with. A rhetorical question.
.@SenShelby, you're resorting to lowest form of politics to promote fear-mongering to divide our country, just to keep power. Have decency.
@SenShelby Fine. You can get someone palatable to your party, or leave it to @HillaryClinton, with Maj Leader @SenSchumer scheduling vote.
@SenShelby so you're asking him to act against the Constitution ?
@SenShelby So you're a strict constitutionalist except when it's politically convenient not to be, eh?
@SenShelby @aspit sounds unconstitutional
@TheIpHawk @SenShelby hell name him in his third term...................
@SenShelby POTUS has constitutional duty to fill SCOTUS vacancy, and yours is to vote, not obstruct. Or do you reject the Constitution?
@SenShelby Many on this thread do not understand the Constitution very well. Obama only gets to nominate. Senate can block confirmation.
@mielewealth @SenShelby  Humm...when's the next recess?
@nemotoad @SenShelby A recess appointment would be right up Obama's power usurping alley, wouldn't it?
@mielewealth @SenShelby IMG_4289.JPG
@nemotoad @SenShelby Not a link. Can't open it.
@SenShelby and we will adamantly oppose any further chance you have of being re-elected...sick of it #ObstructionistGOP
@SenShelby do ur dang job, let Obama do his. Hateful jerk, u and Scalia
@SenShelby to the surprise of.....no one. One would ask "Why" but, c'mon.  We already know.
@SenShelby  ICYMI GOP President's have done it & if you block this it will be the end of the GOP control of Congress #ComingForYourJob
@SenShelby It is THIS president's right and constitutional responsibility to fill this vacancy. You, sir, are an imbecile.
.@SenShelby #Scalia has been dead for less than 12 hours and you are already politicizing his death. Sick.
@SenShelby Pretty sure Scalia did not believe elected officials are free to ignore the Constitution
@SenShelby Of course you will. Historical view will be clear--don't fool yourself. This unprecedented disrespect is transparently RACIST.
@SenShelby February 18th, 1988…you’re argument is invalid.
.@SenShelby I thought you were a strict Constitutionalist...you know, believing in this:
@SenShelby then you are not doing your job, sir. But when did you ever.
@SenShelby Here's that pesky #Constitution that gives the @POTUS the power to nominate justices for @SCOTUS
@SenShelby opposing is all you do. Fuck the constitution, i aint doin my job
@SenShelby But didn't Reagan nominate a justice and got a vote with less than a year left in office. What is the difference?
@SenShelby Yes, white man from Alabama, tell the black president what to do.
@SenShelby Really..well SUCK IT UP BUTTERCUP !!
.@SenShelby He is the Constitutionally elected POTUS. You are choosing to shit on the Constitution. Congratulations.
@SenShelby then you should be impeached for dereliction of duty, you sorry peckerwood.
@SenShelby Why do you hate the Constitution so much?
@SenShelby We learned of Scalia's death not 4 hours ago. Have some respect. #classy #notmyAlabamavalues
@SenShelby You need to brush up on the constitution.
Why do you hate the Constitution? @SenShelby
@SenShelby why do you hate the constitution ?
@SenShelby You're demanding him to act unconstitutionally?
@SenShelby Then you are violating your oath and unfit for the office you hold. This is one of the reasons we elected @BarackObama President.
.@SenShelby 3 Equal Branches of Gov't. SenGOP since 1/20/09 Obstructed.Denied.Cuzed Dysfunction at unprecedented level.ConstitutionBeDarned
@senshelby You’re insane. Bad politics for so many reasons. Making the GOP weaker and setting up to lose, especially down ticket.
@SenShelby I remember when you were a Democrat.
@BlueGreenSpork @SenShelby Ah, yes--Back in the day when SouthernWhiteDemocrat=Bigot. Makes sense that he switched to GOP. So did Rick Perry
@SenShelby because you are against the constitution?
@SenShelby As his your right.  He has a right to choose his nominee. Unfair to attempt to undermine his authority
@SenShelby wow, what a bunch of libtards, we're with you Sir, keep up the wonderful job your doing.
@senshelby That's one way to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.
.@SenShelby That's odd, you didn't have this problem confirming Kennedy in the last year of Reagan's presidency http://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/16_1988.pdf …
@ngiste @SenShelby you gonna oppose the President fulfilling his Constitutional duty? Would u if it was a republican president?
@SenShelby are you drunk? If you don't want to let @POTUS do his job, you should be recalled. Give back your paycheck.
@SenShelby Constitution specifically states that SCOTUS seats are to be appointed by the president. Why don't you respect the Constitution?
@bhamvince @SenShelby -respect the constitution. I think what you just said is an impeachable offense
@SenShelby yeah! That'll show em!!
@SenShelby Well that doesn't seem very "strict constitutionalist..."
@SenShelby I will adamantly call your office every fucking day until the vacancy is filled.
@DavidGallaher @SenShelby Lets all call him every day. http://www.contactsenators.com/alabama/richard-shelby … (251)694-4164 (202)224-5744
@SenShelby Please Stop ANY McConnell "Deals".....
