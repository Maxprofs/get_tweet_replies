@drrik Even the majority of NRA members favor background checks: http://ow.ly/kaJAa  And, yes, they do vote. So...
@DeirdreS  amusing, how was this NRA survey done?
@SenShelbyPress  #NRA increased $$$ to @GOP after #SandyHook. How much per dead child did you get? We will remember. #stoprush #demandAction
@SenShelbyPress Sen. say they're afraid of NRA. Your fear worth more than terror of mass-murdered 1st graders? Coward 4 hire. #DemandAction
#NRA threatened @SenShelbyPress w election backlash.But NRA's #GOP candidates R losing.He betrayed dead 1st graders 4nothing. #DemandAction
