@NASA way to go NASA and we have to take small steps first. Now that you have the data you need we may just be able to send a human next
@NASA @DPowell217 cool men soon
@JohnPowell996 @NASA yes! Can't wait, watched it live, was awesome as only seen footage of Apollo or Apollo 13 movie before! #Spacemission

.@NASA we're making history every day, but this is something special!
@NASAhistory @melissaaho @NASA Couldn't agree more. We feel so privileged to share this experience, even if it is through a screen :)
@ThomasNet that's how a lot of us at NASA watched it too. Inspiring in any format!
@NASA oh wow! Way to go #Nasa! #Space
Yeah! That’s nearly a 1/60 of what has been done in the 60th…
@NASA
@NASA @smartereveryday Outstanding!
“@NASA: #Orion traveled 60,000 mi-farther into space than any ship for humans has gone in 40+ yrs!” CONGRATS MANKIND, WELCOME BACK TO SPACE!
@NASA might want to clarify. It was an apogee of 3,600 miles. Some people mistakenly think we can travel to the moon in 4 hrs.
“@NASA: #Orion traveled 60,000 miles + farther into space than any ship for humans has gone in 40+ yrs!”@eem_leewis my ship > your ship
@eem_leewis BUT YOU DON'T HAVE ONE DO YOU?
 Congratulations again @NASA Thank you for taking us on this picture perfect journey via live broadcast. What a trip! 
“@DawnZpost:  Congratulations again @NASA Thank you for taking us on this picture perfect journey via live broadcast. What a trip! ”
@NASA stick a person in it. Until then it's just an unmanned probe, and we just put one of those on a damn comet

@NASA @drkiki bullshit
@stephenferster @NASA ship, not station. It's semantics.
Yea for space travel! RT @NASA: #Orion traveled 60,000 miles + farther into space than any ship for humans has gone in 40+ yrs!
@NASA @davidem27 still, though, 60,000 miles is only 1/4 of the way 2 t moon, it's about time though!
Brilliant, and little depressing. RT @NASA: #Orion traveled 60,000 miles + farther into space than any ship for humans has gone in 40+ yrs!
@NASA I'm no rocket scientist.
@NASA then maybe you should ask yourselves why you haven't been farther on the last 40 years!
@NASA @SpaceUnitedOrg 60,000 full distance, but only 3600miles up. 3300 miles further than ISS is pretty dang far!
@NASA how's that a good thing? 40 years is way too long...
Kudos to @NASA, @LockheedMartin, and @ULALaunch on successful #Orion test flight. The uncrewed Orion capsule traveled 60,000 miles today!
@NASA awesome job. Congrats to a superb team!
@NASA #Orion so cool!!!

@NASA who thought that up , blimey thats clutching at straws for an achievement. Its only 60,000 miles as well , a micron in space terms.
@NASA @WGRZ 60,000 more? we must be at the end of the universe then!

.@NASA but you can't 'go back' to the moon? Weird that
@LewisMcLoughlin @NASA Why would you want to?
@kappley @NASA with today's technology it should be a Hell of a lot easier to go there, might learn new things about it
@LewisMcLoughlin @NASA I'll take Mars over the moon
@NASA which is so very sad, especially since you did not even bothered to send something innovative out there.
Taktir ettim sizi allah ücün yalan yok.  @NASA
