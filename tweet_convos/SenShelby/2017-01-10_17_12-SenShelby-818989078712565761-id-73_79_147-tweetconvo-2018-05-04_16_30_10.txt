@SenShelby I agree 110% America needs a man of his caliber as AG. Another great Trump selection!
.....A racist homophobe?
find something worthwhile to write about! He is your AG. HE IS YOUR PRESIDENT!  AMEN!
That is something worthwhile to write about....it's a major ethics issue.
let's talk ethics Donna Brazil & debate questions, wassermanshultz forced to step down?
Donna Brazile did nothing worse than what Trumps campaign did Schultz should be in jail
But we're not talking about them, we're talking about Sessions and Trump.
You're going to have to defend them. you cant change subjects.
War on Whites...Really? WSJ rated Alabama 10th worst state for black Americans? Racial division do exists u helped  grow it.
@SenShelby Sessions does not believe in equal rights & neither do you. #TermLimits #WeDeserveBetter #MakeAmericaHateAgain
Pathetic. Sessions has no business being AG
The senate should NOT confirm the racist Senator Sessions. I will be calling you to say so.
truth hurts
you disappoint. Accusing Democrats of promoting war on whites as reason behind accusations of Session racism Project blame much
oh good. Another old, racist congressmanfrom the south defending another old racist congressman from the South. Shocking I know
Funny those coming to @RepMoBrooks' rescue are more old bigots and racists. Looking forward to them dying of old age
Alabama - ground zero for KKK
No, they should not & after your recent comments to @CNN re "War on Whites," you, too, should resign/retire/just go away #Ugh
a history of racism Alabama style. Overlook the history and cry victim to what he brings on himself. Be ashamed sir.
You see his vetting as a "war on whites"??  Really?  Deplorable person
this is 2017 not Jim Crow . You are the racist and you know it.
You said the is a "war on whites" on the radio. Just bc ppl want to have the same #CivilRights that whites have had; is not war
@jeffsessions Is well known as a White Supremacist from way back, and should not hold any public office, let alone U.S. AG.
Well, if the shoe fits...and in this case, it does.
Sessions is a racist. Always has been, always will be.  Does this mean you are too? #racist #bigot #idiot
Of course you support hate and racism. You are just as vile as Sessions and have no right to be in a public office
SHAME on you @RepMoBrooks! REAL leaders UNITE the people. YOU sir, are NO LEADER! http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/11/politics/kfile-mo-brooks-war-on-whites/index.html …
lulu, you are right. This clown is nothing but a joke.
.@RepMoBrooks Not all of #Alabama is proud of him or you. Some of us think you're disgraceful. War on whites? You're so wrong.
and you embarrassed us with your "war on whites" statement.
this is not a "war on whites" this is a war on hate!
Birds of a feather.
the war on racists is NOT the same as your war on whites. You're on the wrong side of history. #mirrormirror

He's an embarrassment to the nation and should never have been nominated. The man is unfit for office.
Sessions not worthy to be a Judge why in the heck the AG?? If u condone it, u are part of it.
I sincerely hope you are right.  Sessions career looks like his idea of Law and Order is a bit outdated.

Have you ordered the robes?
Thank you for your outspokenness and courage in defending Senator Sessions.
no thanks.  One less white supremacist in Trump's cabinet.
Why don't you ask #TrayvonMartin about your bullshit #waronwhites? @RepMoBrooks #BlackLivesMstter #GOPRacists
you set Alabama back 50 years with your "War on Whites" comment. You could have supported #ConfirmSessions without attacking AA
Number of Civil Rights cases led by @SenatorSessions = 0
Number of Klan rallies, lynchings, & hate crimes against Blacks = 983
If there is a "war on whites" it's because you have recessive genes. Black men will continue to impregnate white women! 
Sessions should NOT be confirmed.
yeah-war on whites. yo boy dylann roof also thought the same thing.  JACKASS.
man, you better have been filming a damn Tide commercial when you referenced a "War on Whites".
You are vile w/ your " war on whites".You & your klan was exactly why American Hero @SenBookerOffice had to make a stand
@jlrye52 LOVE SESSION. Great man and will b a GREAT ATTORNEY GENERAL prosecuting Clintons/Obama/Podesta/Huma
@judy_shwabe @tempteststorm2 Senator Sessions is a man that has dedicated his life to the service of his Country. Proud
#StopSessions #EndHate #OldWhiteGuysAreNotWhoThePeopleWant
@JTheTrueBelievr
Thanks for reporting on the #waronwhites!!
his record on *opposing* civil rights makes it clear that he is not qualified for the position of Attorney General.
that poor white man 
If you mean being a #racist makes #alabama proud, wow. That makes me disgusted. #Sessions #JeffSessions #corrupt #BigotInChief
Sir, FYI: Naturalization & Natural born citizens are a Kind. The same natural kind as the Founders.
he did a great job. And since @TheDemocrats don't have the votes to stop it, all the #AltLeft whining is for nothing #MAGA
proud to be racist, hell yeah alabama.
