Not denouncing Bannon is condoning racism and anti-Semitism. #profilesincowardice
Shame on you BOB!!
Where are the right wing evangelicals to stop this kind of behavior.? God is watching you!
I don't see any comment in how you have a white supremacist as Trump right hand man. Cowards!
YOU ARE INCORRECT IN YOURDESCRIPTION.  Cowards are scared.I think Patriots says it all!
& when will you give your thoughts on Steve Bannon then?
We r trusting you to speak out against the white nationalist. This isn't the GOP you've built, is it?
@seanspicer @Reince @realDonaldTrump what about Bannon? Aren't you going to congratulate him too?
What is your response to the Bannon hire?
Solid pick!
Steve Bannon=white nationalist=bad 4 America
If you do not condemn the Bannon pick, you're supporting racism, anti-Semitism, & hate. Or are you actually in favor of those?
will you share your thoughts on bannon with your constituents?
As you said with Putin, we can't ignore the reality of the people with whom our government aligns itself. /1
Which is why it's essential that you raise your voice along with others against Bannon's appointment. I look forward to it. /2
Quit floating ur name for Sec of State...Trump knows what u tried to do to Fannie Mae....#crook
- as long as destroying "radical Islamic terrorism" doesn't mean causing terror for AMERICAN Muslim families.
And Bannon?
This is not the time for a polite golf clap. Your party just made an American Nazi very powerful.
The person who enabled a proto-fascist will not do well in a government position. @SenBobCorker @Reince @realDonaldTrump

I'm hoping as my elected representative you're willing to stand up against divisive hatred entering the WH in form of Bannon
