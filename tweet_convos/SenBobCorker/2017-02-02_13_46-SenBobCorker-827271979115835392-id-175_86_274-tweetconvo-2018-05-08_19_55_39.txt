thank you.
Focus, Senator.  There's a Russian elephant in the room.
can you explain to trump how this whole president thing works? before he ruins everything. forever. for everyone.
Learn why he yelled. It was because idiot Obama agreed to refugees that AUS doesn't want.
whew you do still have phone skills your constituents were beginning to wonder. Coward! We won't forget #DeVosvote
Glad OZ adds such value to our combined Regional stability equally glad to be on same team alongside ourmates in US
As a Tennessee Resident I would like to say we would much rather you spend time helping your constituents.
Enabling the narcissist doesn't address the problem, @SenBobCorker @JoeHockey
Thank you! We need to keep our traditional allies. Thank you for working to keep our friendship with Australia.
good job you! Now do something about the source of the problem.my senator is a fix it kind of guy.right?
That must have been nice for you both, so happy to hear this earth shattering news
Did @JoeHockey give you the same offer he gave the Australian auto industry? It was pure genius
your job is to fight for people of TN, not cleanup others mess! Going forward Act & Vote to prevent problems like this!
you have to realize this is pathetic? and sorry australia 75 million of us voted for somebody else. don't hate. us
I hope keeping that alliance included them keeping their Syrians that THEY accepted. Support Trump and America.
how about standing up to Trump instead of having to clean up the mess. And pls hear the calls from your voters against DeVos!
Is this how it's going to work now? Senators covering for an unfit, unstable POTUS?
.@scott_tobias @Gus_802 @SenBobCorker @JoeHockey Absolutely. Der Hair Fuhrer represents the party. They are scump, and he is them.
hmm #australia says no....
This POTUS is enjoying phone calls from Putin more? I suppose after everything Russia has done for US  good mates?
Apparently you only read twitter. No to DeVos!!
I TOLD you, Joe! But you didn't listen! hahaha
- Bob, we need you to put the American people and country before party. Don't let Trump ruin us all.
An ally doesn't refugee dump.
Glad to hear u clean up the doo-doo our new President is making daily, after all, that's why u were elected, right?
The block everything from your @GOP administration.  @realDonaldTrump is bananas wrapped in corruption
@KateNocera @JoeHockey  
If he goes to war with Australia... #unfuckingbelievable
.@SenBobCorker Do you realize how crazy things are that you had to do that?
Just got off the phone with Ambassador @JoeHockey. We discussed the important and long-lasting alliance between our two countries.
ok Plese do not undermine our President.  Especially after you watched Obama destroy us
what about NO on DeVos?!
better get "on the phone" with your pissed off voters! #byecorker
You have no authority to broker deals with foreign heads of state. I will request the party publicly reprimands you
, vote to benefit children, not the unqualified DeVos.
Speaking of bad DJT moves that need to be fixed - Please vote No on DeVos. No on Sessions. No on Pruitt. -  TN voter
@CNN @SenJohnMccain unfortunate that Senators need 2 undo harm @Potus has done Or as @RealDonaldTrump would say SAD
I hate to say it, but we need you guys to work together to keep us safe. Trump is a loose cannon.
you need to break ranks with The Fuhrer
Please-STAND UP to @realDonaldTrump instead of spending the next 4years apologizing for him & cleaning up his messes! #resist
.@SenBobCorker @JoeHockey If you can't trust @POTUS to handle foreign policy (which we can't) get him out! He's incompetent and compromised.
did you also discuss the raging ignoramus in the WH? Did you both laugh or cry?
@stand up to trump!
thank you for repairing what he's destroying. You're going to have to do a lot more of this I'm afraid.
why are you cleaning up after him?
.@SenBobCorker Thanks for doing this, sir, but it's not enough. Every day is a new crisis. @SenateGOP needs to stand up to this president.
Sir,please know, I too would like one day without feeling embarrassed lately.Please ignore the empty hot air. I do.
Oh, and NO TO DEVOS!
Constituent here. Thank you for reaching out to Austrailia and attempted to mitigate damage. A start. Now, DO MORE!
reject Pruitt!
At what point do you actually match this big talk with votes?
why do you think your action is necessary? We elected Trump and we trust his judgment. Do not undermine our @Potus
@eyoonCNBC @JoeHockey Yea' well, when are you going to have "talk with Donald?"
#GOP paid for dossier, knew Trump was RU agent and still supported his nom so as not to anger rubes. Cowards.
Deal to take refugees from Australia was made by Obama after Trump was elected President.  O left mess 4 Trump.
how about stopping another embarrassment?#VoteNoOnBetsyDeVos
- Corker, you are a RINO.  Perfect example of why we need more Trump instead of senators like you.
Democrats are liars
Thank you for upholding what's left of America's dignity.
Thank you, Senator, for putting out that fire. Many Americans appreciate that you reached out to the Ambassador.
you ready to un screw up a nuclear event on a phone
@nielslesniewski @JoeHockey you guys must be wearing boots and carrying shovels these days. You're the clean up crew.
DT pissed on the legacy and memory of all those Aus serviceman who served alongside US troops.
Joe Hockey is no friend of Australia - self interested politician
Now why don't you and the other Republicans face Trum eye to eye and make him stop!!  Be men!!
Thanks - its still a shit deal for you. No way we are going to let those 1,700 settle in AUS.
@msshreyasen @JoeHockey codify sanctions against Russia and then you might earn some respect! Country before Party! Not likely
You have to do the POTUS job becuz he's inept? IMPEACH NOW! Enough is Enough! Repubs will end up on the wrong side of history.
great. Now you need to change your vote to "no" on DeVos.
how dare u interrupt @JoeHockey on his #auspol taxpayer funded vacation.
I'm glad you did that, but it's a shame you had to.
Aww. Look at you in damage control mode.
Sad that you have to make amends for @realDonaldTrump Is this your job now? Don't forget Tennessee. We remember.
better be a decent discussion, unlike that call between Dump and our PM..
Thank you!
The alliance is very important 
You need to do something about this unfit crazy man who has filled his swamp with sewage.
Mr Corker, I am disappointed with your subliminal message of what you think of President Trump to the Ambassador.
Senator  realises that U.S needs Australian bases to track missiles and fly drones. Trump does not.
if only the ignorant @POTUS felt the same way. Republicans are ruining America.
.@SenBobCorker @JoeHockey  You are the legislators, ball is in your court to LEGISLATE to STOP these CRAZY actions!
Sweeping up after big mouth? Out on your big boy pants and grow a pair against pres. Bannon!!
so you are really just going to cover for trumps mistake instead of calling him out on it. Smh thts bad parenting.
good that you've had 8 years of practice making make these diplomatic calls to our friends, right? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
thank you both.
Next time you speak remember that our fond nickname for him is "Eleventy Joe". He loves it!
what you and McCain did today was self-serving and weakened our country.
isn't everyone sick of cleaning up trump's messes. I, for one, have had enough!!!!!!
Sad you have to engage in damage control. Your leadership & talents are better spent on pre-existing (political) condtions.
.@SenBobCorker So why do you have to clean up the mess after #Trump? It is about time that the Congress rains in this unhinged president.
Get used to smoothing ruffled feathers....but at some point it's not going to work.
@otiose94 @JoeHockey Please send list of preferred platitudes. Thank you.
Sen Corker - no need to apologise. Ave Aussies will always stand with US despite the dickwads leading our respective nations.
I suspect this will be a common event for you.
Great work. Apologize for the clown distracting in the WH, while you destroy the country. Sure, we get.
thank you!
This doesn't negate ur support of Trump & his minions. Better start looking 4 a new job come the election.
Bob - Trump doesnt need you to clean up anything.  You and Lamar are moving too far left already on the vetting.
Great. Now listen to all the voice messages from your constituents saying #DumpDevos. Then file to #impeach.
plz do SOMETHING about our dangerous and demented POTUS. You/McCain doing clean up from bull in china shop ridiculous
Going to be a long 4yrs for Rep defending Trump.  Same as Harper and his lapdogs
Just let Trump do his job. No need for this. @SenBobCorker
Senator, talk to your president. No ambassador should count on weak-kneed #GOP. Where did it get us?
How about you get on the phone with other senators and talk impeachment?
Trying to fix the damage done by our idiot president, Bob?
and how Trump doesn't really speak for many Americans
And what about a read-out of the #Putin call? Oh, there isn't one, because the #WhiteHouse turned off the recorder.
drag him!!!
Joe Hockey? That sounds like a totally made-up name. Who else did you talk to? Mike Basketball?
Did you apologize for us? Because that should've been the first thing out of your mouth.
It's somewhat alarming that Senators are being forced to clean up after the White House.
Did you enjoy the call? I suspect you and @SenJohnMcCain will have to do many of these.
And while you're doing clean-up, please vote no for Devos. She is not a good choice for ALL the children of this country.
I cannot support this enough. PLEASE vote no. There are too many unqualified people in power positions. Dangerous!
why not vote to impeach instead.  It would save us all.
t

crying shame that you have to reassure both Australians and Americans of our bond. WE know it, please let #45 know!
thanks for making sure they know America is with them.
This is not normal for congress to have to clean up behind our POTUS.
how sad our senators have to fix what @POTUS breaks. Thank you for stepping up.
@AlexNBCNews @JoeHockey It's effed up you have to do that.
.@SenBobCorker @JoeHockey If you don't want to do this for 4 years, investigate the dossier.
Americans are embarrassed &ashamed of the idiot in the white house. our apologies for being subjected to his idiocy
@pedwards2014 @JoeHockey what "all you can eat" was Joe at when you contacted him
It's embarassing that @POTUS put you in that position w his childish antics. His incompetence is dangerous.
all due respect - what's it gonna be - party or country? Get with it Dudes poison Cut him out Before worse damage
Senator, when will someone in DC stand up for the American people? After the nukes fly? #impeachtrump #trumprussia
Oz politicians do not stand up 4 Oz- they r people smugglers, coal merchants, sell off 2 china
Sen. Corker, Trump needs to be stopped. He's dangerous. Pls help.
I wish our immigration law was as tough as theirs. no need to fight with them it's a cool Country.
and this is probably making the orange manchild very mad, as we speak...
Band aid in much bigger problem @SenBobCorker @JoeHockey
Your job is literally to follow the circus elephant around and clean up it's shit.  Well done you.  @JoeHockey
glad you're working for the side of peace senator. Please listen to your state. This president is dangerous.
, thank you.
fucking ridiculous
YOU WORK FOR US! Your constituents say NO TO DEVOS.
Thank you, a ray of hope as #POTUS will surely lead us to war. PLEASE don't let him destroy our country. #StandUpToTrump
then you also must have received ALL@IF YOUR MESSAGES from all of ur offices telling you the people say NO TO DEVOS #uwork4us
Thank you.
can you also look into Chuck Grassley being a Russian operative?!
How long can American Senators run around doing damage control duty w our ALLIES? #ImpeachTrump
Thank you Senator. I wouldn't blame the Australians for reacting more like this:
Is it fun doing clean up after the President?
like sending a note to teacher please forgive my son he did not sleep well did not know what he said
Awwww it's so cute how the grown ups keep cleaning up the Baby In Chiefs messes 
But you're still going to continue to shill for the man-child in the White House, yes?
I'll say again, read Profiles in Courage and get a moral compass!!! Voting yes to bankers and bill. is a disgrace!!!
DT will do something else to ruin this and many other important alliances.Your new job is damage control, happy?
maybe we should all send @SenBobCorker some poop pick up bags. He could hook them to his belt. @JoeHockey
tell that to our moron President sir! When will we say enough is enough?!?!
No Devoss! No Sessions! No Steve Bannon
That's great! I'm glad your walking behind @realDonaldTrump with a shovel and cleaning up his mess! #TrumpSucks
I love that image!
thank you
