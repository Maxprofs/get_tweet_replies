@SenBobCorker Bob Corker, if you had done your cry baby act in the 1980's the True Republican Party would had brought you up on Ethics chrgs
@SenBobCorker Congrats on demonstrating bold passion for real economic growth & helping sell progress over politics. Too rare! #Chattanooga

@SenBobCorker Of course you're thrilled. How much money is going in your pocket for screwing people out of their right to unionize? Scumbag.
@SenBobCorker thrilled that VW may no longer build in the south with no union.. you are an idiot http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/19/us-vw-usplant-idUSBREA1I0S820140219 …
@SenBobCorker @TNGOP  Volkswagen official threatens to block expansion if workers won't unionize. http://tinyurl.com/mwrn3kd 
@SenBobCorker Disgrace. Complete disgrace.
@SenBobCorker WORKING MORE HOURS FOR LESS MONEY & BENEFITS ,isn't very efficient. @uaw @teamsters @seiu NO UNIONS NO WORKERS RIGHTS.
@SenBobCorker we all know you were bought and paid for by #kochbros #MSNBC
@SenBobCorker and what business of yours was it anyway? This was union & company issue no senate issue Talk about trying for "fiats"
@SenBobCorker Congrats on interfering with management that was OK with unionization; take a bow genius -- http://tinyurl.com/kyrqdun .
@SenBobCorker You do not have an ounce of integrity ... SHAME ...
@CletisStump @marieann66 @SenBobCorker But WE THE PEOPLE enable him to betray his oath of office & reward him by doing nothing. Not account.
@CarmanK1 @marieann66 @SenBobCorker Me the people is calling him out to his face as I can ...
@SenBobCorker Yeah nice work.It's NOW blowing up because of poiltics getting involved.
@SenBobCorker way to totally screw your constituents.
@SenBobCorker Volkswagen’s top labor rep threaten 2day try block further investments in US South if workers no unionized Hey Sen. good job
@SenBobCorker I'd say the chances of a German car company (most of the biggest in the world) opening another factory in the south is zero.
@SenBobCorker you do realize all German car companies have to get employee/union approval to open a new plant?!
@SenBobCorker So much for repub values like small governmentout of publics life or out of free market. GOP=BS of the day whatever gets votes
Way to kill economic growth @SenBobCorker  VW workers may block southern U.S. deals if no unions: http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/19/us-vw-usplant-idUSBREA1I0S820140219 … #completetool
@SenBobCorker Are you "thrilled" that largely thanks to you Volkswagen have said they probably won't build any more Plants in the south?
@SenBobCorker VW workers may block southern U.S. deals if no unions: labor chief
@SenBobCorker @UAW what you have done, Bob is hurt our whole region. Your interference not only hurt TN but the rest of the south.
@SenBobCorker so U/GOP complain about jobs # then work keep out union, company was on board now may not invest in area you still "thrilled"
@SenBobCorker Shame on you to interfere with a union election. I hope that the NLRB orders a new election because of your interference
@SenBobCorker Thanks to you, Volkswagen staying out of the south! Thank you!
@SenBobCorker You injected gov 't into private business! Resign you anti worker prick!
@SenBobCorker VW/BMW/Audi have to get union approval on locations of new factories and plants. The South will be blacklisted
@SenBobCorker corruption is alive and well in the USA I see
@SenBobCorker You are a real dick head..
@SenBobCorker  Hoorah4 VW
@SenBobCorker yay, you helped workers fight for lower wages and less benefits. How do you sleep at night?
@SenBobCorker You giant hypocrite. So much for the free market without govt intervention. Ur so full of shit. Go suck an elephant dick.
@SenBobCorker Congrats on ur campaign of fear & intimidation--it worked! Voters will long remember u for this.  Stupid GOP (per Jindal) DOA.
@SenBobCorker surprised to see a republican meddling in the economy. Independent voters don't appreciate that kind of influence.
@SenBobCorker You're proud of the way you illegally corrupted the process? Typical Republican. You lied to those workers&you know it!!
@SenBobCorker Did you break the law?  I think you might have.  What a loser you are.  Get rid of your #presidentialdelusions.  You're done.
@SenBobCorker thanks for all you do. We could sure use you here in California. It's a battle here.
@SenBobCorker Oh sure u r. Your threats worked, low wages for all So thrilling for you More$ in you&big bus pockets. COME ON TN Vote em OUT
Shameful. @SenBobCorker: Needless to say, I am thrilled for the employees at Volkswagen and for our community and its future. –BC”
@SenBobCorker Why are Republicans so afraid of workers with a voice? Wait. Never mind. I forgot who you work for. The .01%.
@SenBobCorker Because low wages and shrinking benefits are what keeps your state poor, right?
.@SenBobCorker apparently last week you thought you were Francis Underwood with your treats. Pull through with those jobs you promised!
@SenBobCorker It would have been nicer if you had stayed out of it like you said you would.
@SenBobCorker  Why would u want the workers to vote against their own self-interest? You should have been honest with the workers.
@SenBobCorker only 3  VW plants have NO unions...1 in Tennessee...2 in China... two places where the sheep are in the majority
@SenBobCorker You lying cracker SOB you deserve an ass kicking
@SenBobCorker You don't give a hoot about the employees.
@SenBobCorker what's your excuse when WV passes on installing the SUV line? You sold them out for political reasons "hook, line and corker"
@SenBobCorker USA, founded on slavery.People working for nothing while master reaped the benefits.No unions means treat workers like shit.
@SenBobCorker why to go with your scare tactics on VW vote just one more step to continue gutting the middle class.
@SenBobCorker So you're proud of interfering with a Constitutional right that you swore to uphold? You should be tossed out on you ear!
@SenBobCorker Needless to say, but you're a fascist gangster.
@SenBobCorker is thrilled by fighting for lower wages, less economic security for #TN workers, and yielding to his corporate overlords!
@SenBobCorker first good thing you've done in years. We won't forget u backstabbing TED CRUZ u RINO piece of shit!!
@SenBobCorker sing it with me... "I lie, I cheat, I steal. I lie, I cheat, I steal." That's all you and your party has left. #disgusting
@SenBobCorker Yeah nothing like trying to intimidate American workers and a fair election process. #BobCorker -- Anti-American piece of shit

@The_Anti_Fox @SenBobCorker @HouseGOP @Senate_GOPs @Reince perfect description of GOPs everywhere..sick sick people, petty tyrants, Racists
@SenBobCorker we'll be thrilled when investigation concludes with your removal from office @USDOL @RealEricHolder @FBIKnoxville @HarryReid
@SenBobCorker You're thrilled that you violated Federal Law? You're so arrogant you flaunted your disrespect for the law? Censure or Jail?
@SenBobCorker needless to say, you interfered.
@SenBobCorker You had better come through with that quid pro quo for the VW employees now.
@SenBobCorker Needless to say, you're an ASSHOLE.
@SenBobCorker Yeah, workers actually being on equal footing with employers is awful, right? #sarcasm
@SenBobCorker You would be YOU F'ING SCUMBAG !
@SenBobCorker GOP threatened to withhold tax incentives from Volkswagen if the workers unionized.
@SenBobCorker Great. Now shut your trap about it, RINO.
@SenBobCorker The way you lied was appalling.  Disgusting!
@SenBobCorker At least you are resolute in your shamelessness.
@SenBobCorker Good job for Tennessee.
.@SenBobCorker You bullied them-- so are you thrilled you did?
@andiwilson84 The sh** @SenBobCorker pulled mks him a d*** but workers still cld/shld hv voted yes to @UAW. Its on them.
.@tyjohn47 @SenBobCorker @UAW He used fear and threats . I can't really blame the workers because I don't know what I would do
@andiwilson84 I'd have given @SenBobCorker the bird and voted for rep by @UAW. I don't need f'g Corker or any pol telling me what to do!!!
.@tyjohn47 @SenBobCorker @UAW Well you are strong-- but some are afraid. Learned a long time ago, they have to come around when they r redy
@andiwilson84 I get that but when that happens it may be too late thx to @SenBobCorker's (and other Rs) bullshit. @UAW
,@tyjohn47 @SenBobCorker @UAW Agreed- however, do you think when those same workers go to vote in the next election they will forget?
@andiwilson84 @SenBobCorker @UAW I hope they 1) Don't forget what went dn this wk and 2) Get out and vote in Nov.
@SenBobCorker Congratulations Senator. Great job!
@SenBobCorker You are just another Koch bros whore do what he can to keep the American worker in a low paying job.
@SenBobCorker Thanks for taking the lead in keeping unions out of VW and the south.
@SenBobCorker needless to say we will all be happy when Julia and Emily, your 2 filthy daughters, close their darned legs.
@SenBobCorker <-- Way to "keep govt out of business" Hypocrite! You lied to these ppl and it's going to catch up with you. Can't wait!
@SenBobCorker Pecksniffer.
.@SenBobCorker @BAMAPERRY  As many #Patriots Who value #FreedomOfExpression;STILL available nationwide and in the great state of #Tennessee
@MPhilipOliver @SenBobCorker @BAMAPERRY Patriot = dumb enough to vote against one's own interest
.@SenBobCorker: Of course you are.  Less money for the workers and more for the 1% like you, right?  You GOP are Hippocrates!
@SenBobCorker Thanks for proving who you actually work for.
@SenBobCorker -Too soon to celebrate. Obama's crooked NLRB will step in and invalidate. Obama lawlessness trumps honest Tennesseans.
@PoliticalZone -Step up to a national microphone on a news show @senbobcorker and warn the NLRB to STAY OUT!
@SenBobCorker Hypocrite. Go serve your corporate masters. You should wear a patch like Nascar showing which corporations own you!!
@SenBobCorker  Using power as Senator to deceive constituents is shameful.
@SenBobCorker thrilled for Volkswagon sure but not for the workers! Why didn't u stay out of it? You threatened the workers you hypocrite!
@SenBobCorker hypocrite! Keep government out is you peoples slogan but you inserted yourself into this deal. Keep Govt out?? Hypocrite!!!!
@SenBobCorker Proud to be against workers,  proud of keeping wages down, proud of being a damn liar.# IDIOT
@SenBobCorker you screwed TN. Good to know you support govt intervention in business matters.
@SenBobCorker I wish you were smart enough to be ashamed of yourself.
@SenBobCorker not pro or anti union but I don't like politicians like you meddling and making threats during vote between VW and workers
Great!! @SenBobCorker: Needless to say, I am thrilled for the employees at Volkswagen and for our community and its future. –BC”
@SenBobCorker @jonathanserrie As a Conservative, I do not agree w/ UR politics. U need a true conservative fill your seat. Very Unimpressed
I have to wonder why @SenBobCorker is so against Tennesseans having rights to fair employment. Is David Koch's pocket cozy Bob? #UAWVW
@zenm0mma @SenBobCorker  look at Detroit and you'll understand why.  Big Union Leaders #corrupt eventually economically ruin a city
.@restoreusa100 @SenBobCorker your rhetoric only shows your naïveté in understanding complex issues. Go back to licking Ted Cruz photos.
@zenm0mma @restoreusa100 @SenBobCorker  ouchie!  The truth hurts  I know dem libtards are smarter than everyone well not workers in Chatt!!
.@restoreusa100 bet it really sucked being protected by the teachers union. How corrupting to be guaranteed pension and healthcare #shutup
@SenBobCorker This is awesome!
@SenBobCorker Yeah because you blackmailed/strongarmed them into not joining the union. #RightToWork is a big GOP lie.
@SenBobCorker So if the new VW SUV goes to Mexico you will immediately resign? Right? Or did you just lie about being 1,000% certain?
@SenBobCorker Bad Job By You!
@SenBobCorker You have done so much to help Americans experience the dignity of being a serf.
@SenBobCorker - UGH. thank you, BOB.
@adartproducer @SenBobCorker Thanks for doing your part to screw the American worker, Bob! Walmart wants to hire you, by the way...
“@SenBobCorker: Needless to say, I am thrilled for the employees at Volkswagen and for our community and its future. –BC” Ugggggghhhhhhhhhhh
@SenBobCorker @toddgunter the sooner bob corker and his corporate masters get kicked out of office the better
.@SenBobCorker Article 23 Section 4: http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ … Why are you corporatists so threatened by workers rights/human rights?
@SenBobCorker Great News. Keep Chattanooga and Tennessee moving forward!
.@SenBobCorker Deplorable interference. I hope you receive a visit from the NLRB.
@SenBobCorker that continues to elect you into office...don't let me get started on healthcare...
@SenBobCorker ...unlike the factory workers you just destroyed. I'm disgusted and quite frankly disappointed that I am from the state...
@SenBobCorker I cant wait for the day when you are voted out of office. However, you being unemployed won't matter because you can afford it
@SenBobCorker teachers or factory workers...stop pretending to work for the people of TN while stuffing ur pockets with $ from big business
@SenBobCorker Sad day. But we'll try again. Unions equal people power.
@SenBobCorker union workers keep this economy alive. Without unions we wouldn't have sanitation workers or car manufacturers or...
@SenBobCorker then you have the audacity to applaud destroying a proposed union that would have benefited a community.
.@SenBobCorker The NLRB should be knocking on your door.  Dirty.  Dirty. Dirty.
@SenBobCorker first you introduce a bogus bill STEALING from the taxpayers and students who rely on the #hopescholarship
@SenBobCorker those workers AND their EMPLOYERS wanted them to unionize like all other profitable VW plants. How dare you?!
@senbobcorker Your threats worked. Sad day for those who actually work in the #VW plant. No big deal for you, the multi-millionaire, though.
.@SenBobCorker you mean you're happy that your empty threats worked this time around? #UAWVW
@cstergalas enjoying watching ignorant union hacks like you freak about failure of trying to turn Chattanooga into next Detroit
@SenBobCorker unions do not hurt the economy they encourage the economy.
@SenBobCorker: "I am thrilled for the employees at Volkswagen and for our community and its future." Amen.
@SenBobCorker http://youtu.be/PCGPhzWWgco 
@SenBobCorker Why are you against workers?
@SenBobCorker And now we can all hope they build the SUV in Mexico which hopefully VW will do because of your interference.
@SenBobCorker when the person paying employees says u should do something because he will have 2 pay more... http://is.gd/JHW6UV 
@SenBobCorker Finland = 94% unionized teaching workforce = #1 education system in the world
@SenBobCorker In the words of the Sex Pistols, no future for you, working Americans in this 1% wet dream
@SenBobCorker and for ur wallet, u crooked sniveling little puppet.
@SenBobCorker Love how liberals believe in choice...except for school vouchers and voting to unionize!!!

@SenBobCorker -VW vote results are a great value proposition for more jobs, more auto manufacturers to come south and open. Great work !!!
@SenBobCorker I hope you don't expect @vw to be part of that future while you're in office.
@whitraye @SenBobCorker The future of a low paying job and total subserviency to Big Business.
@SenBobCorker You mean you are thrilled for yourself and your big money interests. The right wing is destroying the country
@SenBobCorker thank you for your efforts. From a proud VW employee.
