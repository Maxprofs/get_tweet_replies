@SenBobCorker Thanks for allowing your conservative values shine, illuminate #Venezuela & reset the mutually beneficial exchange w/the #USA
@SenBobCorker Halleluyia!!!! El UNICO senador q mantenia vetada la iniciativa de sanciones a coruptos del regimen de Venezuela quito su VETO
“@SenBobCorker releases hold on #Venezuela sanctions after VZLA gov't disrupts extradition of drug-trafficker http://1.usa.gov/1o97Tvi ”POR FIN
@SenBobCorker NINGUN politico norteamericano podra oponerse a las sanciones....ni siquiera el negro obama !
La palabra "negro" tiene MUY mala connotacion en ingles. NO ME GUSTA  OBAMA, pero tu tweet ofende, por favor cambialo. @elamando
@outdatuey En realidad la que ofende es "nigger"...la palabra NEGRO es aceptada como descriptiva de la raza!....Sorry.
@elamando He vivido en Estados Unidos lo suficiente para saber de lo que hablo.
@outdatuey Creo que NO lo suficiente......  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negro 
@elamando Hago traducciones, interpretaciones, talleres comunitarios. La teoria no refleja todo lo que se vive a diario.
@SenBobCorker There is no way Democrats in Venezuela hold dialogues with the regime.. They are ruled by Castros' instructions! #SOSVzla
@SenBobCorker Glad to hear it. Decent Venezuelans need US support to get rid of these criminals. Dialogue hasn't work at all.
@SenBobCorker it not only threatens its neighbors and the U.S. But we venezuelans who are suffering as well. the sanctions should be public
#HR4587 #S2142 Unbelievable how many lives and torture could have been saved since that hold has been in place, @SenBobCorker #Venezuela
@SenBobCorker Thanks Senator for helping pass the Bill against Maduro "Narco State" which is killing the Venezuelan people.
