@sailvarmint @SenBobCorker Director of Homeland Security said the tenacles of ISIS reach into all 50 states.

@sailvarmint @SenBobCorker
@SenBobCorker thanks for providing more proof this is the most pathetic congress in U.S. History. #neuteredIrrelevantCongress
.@SenBobCorker The other simple fact is that you are hurting our country on this issue.
@pmjenk @SenBobCorker Then why are democrats siding with the republicans on this issue?
@SenBobCorker YOU FUCKING SELLOUT FRAUD! DO YOU REALLY THINK WE WOULDNT SEE RIGHT THROUGH THIS FRAUD BILL? SURRENDERING TREATY POWERS! FRAUD
@SenBobCorker @whpresscorps No this is self serving on your part!
@MonicaN7o8 @SenBobCorker @whpresscorps The deal is no more than a self serving legacy item for Obama. Does nothing to protect us or Isarel.
@SenBobCorker pay attention my fellow republicans. Corker sold us out and is lying to us about this bill.
Did Senate pass the bill..I"m confused?? Did they fold? “@LisaLeeM @SenBobCorker pay attention my ... http://tmi.me/1f2XIa 
@corockymtns @SenBobCorker listen to @marklevinshow   He sums it up: http://m.therightscoop.com/mark-levin-exposes-how-us-senate-just-gutted-constitutional-treaty-power-and-gave-it-to-obama/ …
@SenBobCorker @joelpollak and you caved and all but guaranteed he gets whatever deal he wants. Way to spin.
@SenBobCorker @tjemery1 Congratulations You've done a great job
hey Robert you got to listen to this http://therightscoop.com/mark-levin-exposes-how-us-senate-just-gutted-constitutional-treaty-power-and-gave-it-to-obama/ … @SKCMSSDV @SenBobCorker
@tjemery1 thanks for posting this.
@SenBobCorker @batchelorshow #POTUS gives #GOP Pyrrhic victory, Dems get 30d procedural hurdle, political CYA & No linkage to Iran behavior.
@SenBobCorker Just like you'll never have 67 Votes to override Obama's Veto when congress tries to continue its own sanctions.Please Resign
@ConserValidity So @SenBobCorker is just another rhino obama sycophant destroying the country, the govt & the Constitution
@SenBobCorker Your bill is toothless-allows it to pass w/only 34 votes!  You just gave up rights of Senate to ratify treaties. I'm outraged!
@SenBobCorker @jakejakeny Yeah-but the deal is watered down and we need to FOCUS on the Russian missiles.
@SenBobCorker You just gave up the treaty power, along with the power of the purse, and the power over immigration. You moron.
@SenBobCorker @texbarb thank u! Barry trying to hand over nuclear keys to Iran, taking Cuba off terrorist list...God help us
@rash_jo lol Cuba is a sponsor of terrorism?
@catchdadamnball do your research...
@SenBobCorker
MORON OR SELLOUT?
Paragraphs four and five say it all...

@SenBobCorker Republicans r a Party 4 WAR If the Congress was allowed 2 make sole decisions on WAR US would b fighting 3 WARS right now
@SenBobCorker @IranArabSpring 
Sanctions are working. Add $20/bbl oil war, & it'll be a matter of time to capitulation.
@SenBobCorker "I never liked that part of the constitution anyway."
@SenBobCorker nice work
@SenBobCorker Some of us are not sheeple.You have just given up senate treaty powers! Obama walks circles around repubs and laughs about it.
@SenBobCorker @morningmika @Morning_Joe Sen Corker you need to give classes to your peers in BOTH houses so they learn how to do their jobs.
@SenBobCorker the WH dropped it bc they know we won't have 67 votes override the veto. You've given up our treaty power. #spineless #tcot
@SenBobCorker is that why you caved and gave Obama everything he wanted? haha whatever helps you sleep at night buddy. 
@SenBobCorker they dropped the veto because you gave him the power to make treaties on his own! You lying dissembling creep.
http://m.therightscoop.com/mark-levin-exposes-how-us-senate-just-gutted-constitutional-treaty-power-and-gave-it-to-obama/ … @SenBobCorker PLEASE LISTEN TO WHAT THIS PIECE OF SHIT JUST DID! YOU LITTLE FUCKING TRAITOROUS WEASEL! EXPOSED! FRAUD
@SenBobCorker Good job standing up for the American people on proposed Iran deal. #USAspoke
@SenBobCorker - Yes. The WH is only agreeing, because the vote came out 19-0 against Obama. Obama had no choice but to agree with Congress.
@SenBobCorker and this is thanks to your hard work. We can all hope that this change of tide has not taken place too late.
@SenBobCorker spin it anyway you want, but the true fact: the bill has been revised drastically so no need for a VETO!  We C U! @sahilkapur
Forfeiture of assets would be appropriate & more realistic to prevent cheating. @SenBobCorker @SenatorMenendez @SenKaineOffice @RepEdRoyce
@SenBobCorker The simple fact is that we should not enter into any agreement, treaty, or arrangement, with ANY terrorist country PERIOD.
@SenBobCorker
So my question for you is, are you an idiot or a sell-out? Why have you abdicated your Constitutional responsibility?
@SenBobCorker
FACT: Before the Corker bill, 2/3 of the Senate was required to *approve* the treaty. Now 2/3 would be needed to *stop* it.
@SenBobCorker You just guaranteed that Obama will get whatever deal he wants. House should not be voting on this
as it can't overturn a veto
@SenBobCorker You just guaranteed that Obama will get whatever deal
he wants. House will never be able to overturn a veto later.
Thanks for the leadership & for asserting that Congressional sanctions can only be lifted by Congress. @SenBobCorker
@SenBobCorker THANK YOU FOR STANDING UP. IT MUST BE EXHAUSTING BUT YOU ARE SO APPRECIATED.
“@SenBobCorker: The simple fact is that the White House dropped its veto threat because they weren’t going 2have the votes 2sustain a veto.”
@SenBobCorker @dbe928 thanks dumd ass
@SenBobCorker will your daughters be signing up for military service, or is that just for other families?
@SenBobCorker @batchelorshow US Constitution is fairly explicit on treaty making as a joint process of legislature and executive
@SenBobCorker @batchelorshow why doesnt the Senate vote on the deal with Iran as a treaty rather than as a piece of legislation
@SenBobCorker Isn't it time you changed your "R" to a "D"
@SenBobCorker before this bill, @WhiteHouse could not legally lift sanctions in place, now #CONgress requires 2/3 majority to #OverrideVeto!
@SenBobCorker NO! fact is your bill is going to require a full Congressional SuperMajority to overrule #IranNukeBill. U hav been duped!
@SenBobCorker @larryelder why the hell did you give in to Obama what a failure the GOP senate has become. Bunch of gutless rhinos!
@SenBobCorker @larryelder the payback Cuba
@SenBobCorker @FreeBeacon  Thank you Sen Corker and all who supported this.
@SenBobCorker Classy.  Such a statesman.
@SenBobCorker Simple fact you are a tiny man with a Neapolitan complex, that wants to #warmonger, and kill more of our troops! U R a Coward!
Thank you, @SenBobCorker
@SenBobCorker well done sir. Keep up the good work!
@SenBobCorker @larryelder  The libtards are out in full force today....the welfare funded crack pipe must be empty.
@SenBobCorker @larryelder Obama is the only president in U.S. history who has had his patriotism questioned so his treaties must be examined
@SenBobCorker @cerenomri you are a menace to this country&to Israel.
@SenBobCorker @Daroff Good for you to have been steadfastly vigilant and possible derailed a crazy deal with IRI...
@SenBobCorker @cerenomri  Next week they'll claim they asked that this legislation be crafted.
@SenBobCorker @sahilkapur Ok, this is called democracy.
@SenBobCorker @whpresscorps yea I'm sure that's true cause egotistical jerk would have vetoed it
@SenBobCorker @oldbaldeagle What about the threats on our border and terrorist training camps all over our country Senator?
@usplaymoney  @oldbaldeagle The democrats have done nothig to halt the threats on our border or inside the country. They see more dem voters
