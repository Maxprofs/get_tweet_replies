Bob "The Price Is Right" Corker hates that @realDonaldTrump can't be bought by @WellsFargo like he was 
Here's a sampling of what's on our minds here in #Knoxville: #DefendDaca  #EndWhiteSupremacy. But you'd know that if you held a townhall
Do you speak for all of Nashville? Are you supporting those pushing for #SinglePayerNow?
Senators represent the whole state and @WeAreAKIN is in Knoxville so...
You can't drop mic until you answer the second question: 

Are you pushing for #singlepayer... or have you decided that's just ... too hard?
Sooo ... about #singlepayer. Gonna help advocate for that, @WeAreAKIN?
Dude. We're an immigrant rights group. AKIN members may have a position on single payer, but AKIN doesn't have an official policy position.
Sorry. I thought "Defend AcA" meant "Defend Affordable Care Act."

Shit that's embarrassing. 
Nope - Defend DACA - Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. No worries.
And as you cast stones against our own party's President - don't forget the racially charged senate campaign you ran the first time.
Thank you for standing up against trump.  He is a sick man and should not be our president 
Does Rep.Brooks agree with you?
Coward
Sen Cut and Run Corker should keep to what he knows cutting deals with Walmart and lining his own pockets with Tax Payer $$$.  Must go
I used to live in Cleveland Tn and voted for you. I urge you to support president Trump or you to could be replaced
Nope. Still not condemning Trump yet. Sad!
So....are you all done with the whole white supremacy problem?
They bring shame upon their families &USA @SenBobCorker @SenAlexander @SpeakerRyan @GOP by supporting @realDonaldTrump Is it worth it?
Great to see Bob Corker not afraid to speak up about Trump...was worried the GOP were just his puppets
Not a good decision to publicly attack our President-
As a native Chattanoogan, I'm disgusted with your comments Sen. Corker
Do they speak your language Mr. Corker? You see, when Obama broke the laws, I didn't hear you talking about it, why? is Trump hard on you?
Thank you for denouncing our racist POTUS!  He is a disgrace to our beautiful nation.  He scares me.

Either way Trump Train Xpress
I just threw-up in my mouth. There's just NO cure 4 stupidity. YOU won't be re-elected! YOUR crap only makes us Trumpers STRONGER & MADDER!
Thank you for your statement on this morally bankrupt president.  Finally, a republican leader who has a spine!!!
#Trump2020 
Sad catering to the identity political Left who can't win an argument without falsely labeling those who disagree. Preserve History!
You need to step up and call for impeachment.  Stop your mealymouthing and put country before party

Yes, hard but why it's called character
When will you listen to us at an event without an entrance fee? Your time should not be for sale.
You had a great time while Heather Heyers family was holding a funeral. Your silence kills.
Bob, that was NOT what you should have been tweeting about yesterday. Man up and speak out against POTUS45 openly supporting the altright!
Donald trump is white nationalist Nazi terrorist sympathizer, would u like to call him out by name?
Corker what do you think of Trump's comments?  did the KKK take over the GOP? Both have 3 letters and never say anything bad about Trump.
No comment about @realDonaldTrump and his disgusting statements today? Please start standing up to this disgraceful administration.
So glad you had a great afternoon, Senator. Catch that presser by Trump where he blamed "both sides" for Nazi violence? Care to comment?
Please stand up and speak up today.  We need to know our leaders will not tolerate people that espouse hatred toward my fellow Americans.
What do you have to say about @realDonaldTrump today? Your constituents deserve a real stand against white supremacy
#fiddlingwhileromeburns
You officially are in support of a neo Nazi , white supremacist, unhinged, narcissistic habitual liar. He is a danger to Americans! #IMPEACH
Why aren't you speaking out denouncing trumps racist support for right supremacist groups?
So it is true that Trump is your voice, face, and moral mirror. If you don't stand against what he said today, it seems you are racist too.
Did you enjoy hearing Trump talk today about the "fine people" in the neo-Nazi, white nationalist mob that rioted in Charlottesville?
Decent people speak up against Nazis, senator. Christians speak up against Nazis!
So when can we expect your new initiative to "Stand Against white supremacy"!  You will stand against white supremacy right?
Is @SenBobCorker a #nazi #racist sympathizer, or just a coward?
So, you were Trumps biggest supporter in TN. Do you think his statement today was good? Are you proud of your leader?
Complicit
Glad you had fun today. The rest of us are absolutely horrified by POTUS.
Please name a white supremacist that is a"very fine person."Today Trump Says There Were “Very Fine People on Both Sides” in Charlottesville.
Trump said there were also good people marching with the Nazis.
Would you march with Nazis???
Unless you renounce Trump after today, you are shameful.  Time to stand up for what is right!
crickets from you on trump today...disgraceful...
#thereIsOnlyOneside Did you talk about Charlottesville?
Your President let Americans know how he really feels about the hate of white supremacy. He won't be happy until we have a civil war.
will you continue to remain silent about President's support of nazi's, white supremists and KKK?  will you stand up directly...finally?
Donald Trump just openly compared George Washington to Confederate leaders. Will you condemn?
Thank you for asking our State Legislators to remove the KKK leader from the Capitol in Nashville.
why haven't you spoken out about @realDonaldTrump 'S SPEECH. you need to put the country before party.
your madman is destroying our democracy! U need to distance yourself or get used to private life!
What's on my mind is why you haven't denounced the president for calling neo-nazis "very fine people."
What's it going to take? After that idiotic press conference today, you know what to do!
Wow, back in Tennessee, @SenBobCorker? Did you talk about your admiration for @SenMitchMcConnell? (You will vote for anything he proposes.)
Ok Senator.  Now you've heard the shit come out of Trump's mouth again.  It's time to make a decision, who's side are you on?
Still avoiding the true issues of the day ! What is your position on Charlottsville ?
Ok, u heard Trump this afternoon.  Here's ur moral moment.  What r u going to do about it?  R u going to keep supporting him or dump him? 
We are awaiting your denouncement of 45's recent statements.
Awww, SO great to see our son & grandson involved with Sen. Corker (a good guy) & Rotary!!!
Have a town hall. Constituents want to know how you plan to support #ACA in TN. Our health care is under threat & you should care about that
You bring shame upon your families &USA @SenBobCorker @SenAlexander @SpeakerRyan @GOP by supporting @realDonaldTrump Is it worth it?
Hey Corker, Shouldn't you be working on health care, tax cuts, immigration etc.
How about a Memphis Town Hall
Your constituents are still waiting on you to attend one of our town halls. We keep calling, you keeping ducking. 
#eastTNresist
Yea Bob, but you hear what you want to hear. Resign
What's on my mind is white supremacist domestic terrorism.  Haven't heard you denounce white supremacists working in the White House.

They bring shame upon their families &USA @SenBobCorker @SenAlexander @SpeakerRyan @GOP by supporting @realDonaldTrump Is it worth it?
Are you going to put them in conservatorship? They look ready for a Net Worth Sweep.
How lucky for the rotary club. When will you face your constituents that are not rotary members?
Did anyone question you about shorting FNMA? #Fanniegate
Can you please have a #TownHall meeting? Your constituents want to speak with you.
Looking forward to you all getting back to Wash, DC & getting healthcare & tax reform done for the American people #MAGA #MASA
Then Senator Corker you would have a Town Hall.
WOW  a bunch of old white guys..shocker
