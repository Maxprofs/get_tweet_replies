@SenBobCorker @brianbeutler who is Sen Corker talking about with his Harvard/Princeton remark?
@jignrig Ted Cruz
@brianbeutler I know, I was trolling for Corker--guess he's not willing to be on the record either, just like his House colleagues.
@jignrig nobody in the Senate will be confused about what Corker was saying there.
@brianbeutler dude, I know--totally tongue-in-cheek on my end. Just waiting for the Canadian metric system reference now from next Sen R.
@jignrig haha. I wonder how many metres it is from his office to the Senate floor.
@brianbeutler unfortunately for Rafael I think he's going to have to find out the hard way--House R's are gonna make him walk the walk.
@SenBobCorker @Jesse_Livermore speechless
@SenBobCorker You may not have gone to an Ivy League college but you have stepped into the"ruling class elite"w/obvious ease. #MakeDCListen
@SenBobCorker A vote against cloture today will keep Sen. Reid from funding "The Adorable Care Act" with 51 votes. Please stop the ACA!
@SenBobCorker You should be embarrassed for not standing on defunding Obamacare. Your days as a senator are numbered. @SenTedCruz #cspanchat
@SenBobCorker I'd been nice if you could count to 30+ million...the amount of illegals that you wish to make citizens.
@SenBobCorker @normcoleman This actually ticks me off more than any comment from any GOPer. @SenTedCruz has forced an important debate
@hughhewitt @SenBobCorker Cruz has prompted a great debate-but the path he urges will both fail &weaken our Party.Don't kill the messenger
@normcoleman @SenBobCorker But even more, a personal attack on the fact that one of your colleagues has great credentials is just low class
@hughhewitt @SenBobCorker One can question Ivy League reference-but U need a little tough skin in the Senate.Corker raises a legit concern.
@normcoleman @SenBobCorker NC: You never --ever--attacked a fellow senator personally.  Unbelievably low class.
@SenBobCorker go ahead and destroy the country Senator, I would hate to see your position weakened. Clown.
@SenBobCorker You do what is right regardless of the amount of opposition.
@SenBobCorker @codydvickers they mocked newt's special orders as box canyons. Then he became speaker
@SenBobCorker I wish our elected officials in Tennessee would stand up for us like these other states. Stand on principle
@SenBobCorker can you count how many months before you have a conservative challenger?
@SenBobCorker Neither did this O'fart but none of you turnips no mathematics. NONE http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/pd.htm … Andrew Jackson in 1835 had BALLS
@senbobcorker dont vote for cloture. That tactic will weaken your position.
@SenBobCorker  How stupid can you be????????????????????
Not sure what @SenBobCorker can count, but it doesn't take any college to figure out he is a spineless wimp afraid of taking a stand 4 right
@SenBobCorker @gretchininTN Stand up for what is right. Stop going along to get along. Stop Obamacare.
@SenBobCorker you're wrong, maybe you can't count, only way at this point. DO SOMETHING! stand up & stand united! No Cloture.
@SenBobCorker I am asking you to oppose the Cloture vote. A vote for it is a vote for Obamacare.
@SenBobCorker YOU should be offended that Schumer said "We won't blink, we're together you're not". That's reason enough to oppose them.
@SenBobCorker You didn't go to Harvard or Princeton, but you can sure undermine fellow Republican Senators while Dems cheer you on.
@SenBobCorker Your strategy is...attack fellow Republicans.
@SenBobCorker <<You embarrassed yourself today debating  Cruz. If Republicans vote w Reid, against the people, don't expect our support
@SenBobCorker VOTE NO ON CLOTURE SENATOR! You know what is happening!! Your lie WILL NOT STAND THE TEST!!
@SenBobCorker American people R energized behind @SenTedCruz If no Harvard/Princeton, maybe go to Sesame St - do some counting.
@SenBobCorker If you haven't noticed, we already have a weak position. How about coming up w/a tactic that'll defeat this Bill!
@SenBobCorker Here is a question. Why the CR bills? Why no budget in the last 4 or 5 years? Please explain why never any talk about budgets?
@SenBobCorker Weaken your position??? Schools have nothing to do with this...TAKE A STAND with @SenTedCruz You sir are a RHINO!!!!
@SenBobCorker exactly what position is that? Continually getting rolled by the Dems? #kudos
@SenBobCorker you're probably right. it's a much better idea to just get steamrolled by Dems via their blatant lies @Jesse_Livermore
@SenBobCorker Courage is doing what is right not just counting with your fingers and toes.
@SenBobCorker WEAK is what U are. The numbers aren't the point. Point is that you stand up 4 something, for "The People", even if it fails.
@SenBobCorker We need you to defund obamacare,,and no to closure Stand with Senator Cruz and with the majority of Americans
@senbobcorker Senator Corker so you will vote for cloture? Or to stop debates? I thought you were against #Obamacare. America will remember
@SenBobCorker Yes you can count & you always count republicans out. Oh well MSNBC likes you.
@SenBobCorker - you need to spend some time in TN and discover what your constituents think & what we've started to think of you..not much.
@SenBobCorker WTG old traitorous Backbencher Corker. You are weak & cowardly and that is the weak position. Vote this third rate rep out TN!
@SenBobCorker How do you expect to Defund if you raise white flag before the fight begins? Defund & against cloture http://www.dontfundobamacare.com/ 
@SenBobCorker If you really care about your constituents you will defund,. I will not vote for you if you don't!
@SenBobCorker step up Sir  and stand with Senators Cruz and Lee. Your position will be weaken if you don'r stand together.
@SenBobCorker  OR IT COULD MAKE IT GROW.  AMERICA DOESN'T WANT OBAMACARE.  YOU WILL LOOSE YOUR SEAT IF U DON'T STAND UP TO REID!
@SenBobCorker From Alabama..Corker  is  making the Queen of England proud.
@SenBobCorker Either defund, get it done now, or be a slave forever; I think you secretly want ObamaCare to be in full effect.
@SenBobCorker At least you are giving the Dems cover. You sure are courageous against Repubs, how about you actually stand up to the Dems.
@SenBobCorker we didn't go to Harvard either.  But we understand the math that a great % of the people want #obamacare de-funded. B a leader
"A vote for cloture is a vote for Obamacare" #defundobamacare #tcot #JusticeForBenghazi4 @SenBobCorker
@SenBobCorker I want it DEFUNDED!
@SenBobCorker so tell us pinhead what tactic will work? Do you even talk to your voters. If you don't want to fight then retire.
@SenBobCorker Rhinos like you are what's killing the Republican Party, Conservatives support Cruz, and we are taking notes for 2014
@SenBobCorker Wrong! Stand with the House and the american people.
@SenBobCorker GOP Obamacare Defunding Bill Would Gut Children’s Health Insurance Program http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/19/gop-defund-chip_n_3955411.html … Please fix this!
@SenBobCorker At least @SenTedCruz is doing something. We the people will have 2 live under OC. You and others in the government will not.
@SenBobCorker U WERE PUT IN OFFICE TO DO UR CONSTITUENTS BIDDING , SENATOR CORKER!!!!!!!!!!
@SenBobCorker Thinking your time is short in DC. 2014 is on the way.. But maybe a RECALL on you and sister Lamar is OTW.
@SenBobCorker You are so full of the obummer KOOL-AID that your sorry assed eyes have turned RINO Brown.
@SenBobCorker guess it is easier to count Senators than it is to count voters.
@SenBobCorker  UR NOT 4 THE PPL IF U VOTE AGAINST THE HOUSE BILL. RECALL ANY1,  IF THEY DON'T SUPPORT THE HOUSE BILL AS IS.
Hey @SenBobCorker difference between @SenTedCruz and other mealy mouth GOP Senators, @tedcruz not only talks the talk he also walks the walk
@SenBobCorker Hey Bob, @SenTedCruz is doing exactly what we elected him to do. Problem with that? We didn't elect no stinking benchwarmer.
@SenBobCorker So you're for Obamacare? A  yes vote on Cloture is a yes vote for Obamacare, plain and simple. No counting necessary.
@SenBobCorker Weaken who's position? Not the Conservative position. Vote NO on Cloture. ACA is killing the economy & jobs. TN is watching.
@SenBobCorker grow a political backbone and support @tedcruz
@SenBobCorker Counting is one thing. Standing up for what's right is another. Vote NO on Cloture. Right thing to do. ACA is destroying jobs.
@SenBobCorker To bad your instinct is to attack an individual versus the law which is slowly but surely crushing economic growth.
@SenBobCorker the sure way to strengthen the R brand is to dump crappy Senators like Corker, Alexander, McCain, Ayotte, Graham, McConnell++
Obamacare Exempt @SenBobCorker Your Big Govt RINO Record Proves You Aren't on The Side of the People. *We Detest your Deplorable Positions!
@SenBobCorker Your Position?Which one,Your Deplorable Support of Obama's Syria Attack? Of Amnesty? Or Your pathetic Dodd/Frank Contribution?
@SenBobCorker Respectfully disagree. Align w/@SenTedCruz, force Obama/Dems to either fund govt w/o OCare or shut govt down! #DefundObamacare
@SenBobCorker what position? Stand up and fight!
@SenBobCorker No, republicans that straddle the fence will fail, and weak our position. You love Obama.
@SenBobCorker @AlexisinVT Wanna know how your position can get weaker? Vote NO to defunding Obamacare, and lose reelection. #cowards
@SenBobCorker what is "our to position"? If you personally can't add ideas the positive direction of the nation get lost. Dogs can follow.
@SenBobCorker what is "our position"? If you personally have nothing to add to the positive direction of nation get lost. Dogs can follow.
@SenBobCorker @AlexisinVT We have to Stop Obama Care, now what is your plan? Cave!
@SenBobCorker We don't agree that it will fail and weaken our position. It will unite us. Please vote to Defund Obamacare!
@SenBobCorker
@SenBobCorker Shame on you, Ted Cruz has done more for the conservative movement in a few short months, shut up or get on board!
@SenBobCorker just defund obamacare and stop siding with democrats.
@SenBobCorker Obamacare increases the number of tax collectors and decreases the number doctors. Is this the reason U bad mouth @SenTedCruz
@SenBobCorker @JWGOP They're all the same. All those Harvard people.
@SenBobCorker @GeorgeShields Common sense.
@SenBobCorker Mudslinging at a fellow Republican is beneath you. We are all on the same side. Do the right thing. #Obamacare is a job killer
Tell us again @SenBobCorker exactly who is exempted from Obamacare....Please start with how Congress and their families are exempted.
@SenBobCorker I had the opportunity to speak to you once. You said you would be our voice. Our voice says to defund ObamaCare. RU listening?
@SenBobCorker Didn't go to Princeton, but live on Main St. & we want ACA STOPPED. Democrats can count on the "OldGuard" GOP to divide us.
@SenBobCorker Stand with House Senator! Fight the ACA! It's hurting We the People. Resistance is NOT futile!
@SenBobCorker Home Depot is latest company to cut Healthcare. R U doing anything about this or simply standing by COUNTING the companies?
@SenBobCorker @WyattBertsch ACA implementation needs delay to amend the Act as POTUS wants to drop parts of it. Defunding is not right.
.@SenBobCorker to reporters yesterday, "Did you see my Tweet?"
@SenBobCorker with your professed ability to count when did become a fan of the 20-30 hour work week?
@SenBobCorker 
I did not go there either...but it is time for Republicans to take a stand and I would hope you change your mind!
@SenBobCorker Lead, follow, or get the fuck out of the way senator. I lost the healthcare and doctor I was told I could keep.
@SenBobCorker the congressmen and women are trying to save this country, you sir and letting us go to hell
@SenBobCorker  Wont be your problem after 2014. Good Riddance.
@mickbonder Too bad you weren't paying attention last year when he was re-elected (there were opponents). Won't get rid of him 'til 2018
@MotherGoos3  Not from Tennessee. Looking to move there. McCain pulled the same crap.
@mickbonder Well, welcome. We need all the help we can get.We're over run w RINOs-governor & 2 senators.Hope to get rid of Lamar next year
@SenBobCorker Won't be your problem after 2014.Good riddance.
@SenBobCorker @JohnAvlon so u will just fold and give up that easy...wow...lets have 1 party system then if there is no opposition 2 nothing
@SenBobCorker  All Republicans should be unified to defund O'care. Vote sends strong symbolic message/strengthens position with 2014 voters.
@SenBobCorker @Prof_Hatcher U didn't take math, either. Spending Billions u don't have is as stupid as spending cents u don't have, either
@SenBobCorker Bull.
@SenBobCorker  you’re a weak and pathetic man.
@SenBobCorker It only fails if you give up. You are more addicted to our money than we are to your services.
@SenBobCorker I didn’t go to Harvard or Princeton, but I can count, too – thousands losing jobs, thousands having hours cut – must defund it
@SenBobCorker @SenBobCorker Hey Bob, we would like to get the same deal on Obamacare that you got. Do you have a problem with that?
@SenBobCorker the thing that has you confused here is something you're not familiar with, it's called LEADERSHIP.
@SenBobCorker I didn't go to Harvard or Princeton-What a lame statement. Part the problem with the GOP go  talk to Senator Cruz, not Tweet
@SenBobCorker This comment is not only WRONG, but unlike you!  I'd expect more from you.  Thanks, @SenTedCruz @RandPaulSenate @SenMikeLee
.@SenBobCorker Instead of cursing the darkness,  why don't you light a candle. Show a little backbone.  #defundit #sentinels
@SenBobCorker @mattklewis If POTUS can back track & cow-tow to Putin, he can make the deal on O-Care! Defund it! No exemptions! @FoxNews
@SenBobCorker @JohnAvlon By "our" you were referring to the United States of America, correct?
@SenBobCorker And your plan to stop Obamacare is what???
@SenBobCorker apparently not a fan of balls either,  because you have none. Private sector is in your near future. #RINOgohome.....
@SenBobCorker You could not get in either school.  Good thing though.
@SenBobCorker Respectfully, what, sir, is your alternative? (BTW, by NOT fighting, THAT will weaken the GOP position.) @mattklewis
@SenBobCorker @mattklewis I disagree. Defund it, or lose. We are furious & have had it. My ins. has skyrocketed in cost with less coverage.
@SenBobCorker U should listen to someone who did go to Harvard. Bravo Ted Cruz. Bob Corker, Sit Down. - Hugh Hewitt - http://townhall.com/columnists/hughhewitt/2013/09/20/bravo-ted-cruz--bob-corker-sit-down-n1705054 …
@SenBobCorker Duh!
.@SenBobCorker You've just been served your comeuppance 4 ur déclassé slander of Ted Cruz in the form of a Townhall piece by @hughhewitt
@SenBobCorker You don't have to go to Yale or Princeton to show a bit of class.
@SenBobCorker Are you just another Vichy Republican?  With your kind of courage, we would still be saluting the Union Jack.
.@hughhewitt responds -- http://townhall.com/columnists/hughhewitt/2013/09/20/bravo-ted-cruz--bob-corker-sit-down-n1705054 … MT @SenBobCorker: I didn’t go to Harvard or Princeton, but I can count
Bravo @SenTedCruz! @MattMackowiak @hughhewitt Ignore the time servers like @SenBobCorker and keep doing what we sent you to DC to do!
@SenBobCorker You vote for it and YOU own it.
@SenBobCorker you are weak step aside
@SenBobCorker Why don't u support ur fellow Senators instead of slighting them publicly?The filibuster may give needed media coverage.
@senbobcorker I disagree. Make the Left go on record with Obamacare. Start messaging against Obamacare. #Stand
@SenBobCorker  You helped create these TP idiots Proud?
@SenBobCorker @BuzzFeedAndrew trying to win another election. You will have lost before even running all of you spineless simpletons.
@SenBobCorker @BuzzFeedAndrew Republicans can't even stand and fight the biggest government takeover of all time.If you don't good luck
@SenBobCorker @BuzzFeedAndrew your constituents will back you through the fight. Even Dem voters want to get rid of ObamaCare,it's horrible.
@SenBobCorker @BuzzFeedAndrew are you that worried about your cushy job? Defund and be respected for your stance against a terrible law.
@SenBobCorker @BuzzFeedAndrew bring it #all out in the open #obamacare #failures #effing #fight stop #cowering #tcot
@SenBobCorker @BuzzFeedAndrew Listen to your constituents and defund ObamaCare, you work for us asshole. It will be Dems who shut gov down.
@SenBobCorker @BuzzFeedAndrew  Bob, when You are and have nothing to offer #USA You come up with Foolishness. Hate of @whitehouse +Americans
@SenBobCorker There are those trying to do something about it and then there others content to do nothinng (corker, mccain)
@SenBobCorker Hey Bob I didn't either but I know laying your cards on the table nullies any negotiations or compromises.
@SenBobCorker @normcoleman Not if the Senate GOP knows how to make an argument for more than the Beltway audience. Talk to people, not DC
@hughhewitt  @normcoleman - I am one of @SenBobCorker constituents; he'll be lucky to even be in the race next round. We are not happy w/him
@SenBobCorker @normcoleman  But your predecessor @Bfrist actually went to both. #Impressive
@SenBobCorker Obamacare will be like a barbed hook.. if you wait to long to fight it.. you will never get it out.
@SenBobCorker Even though Obamacare has never been more unpopular among Americans, labor leaders, employers? If the fight isn't now, when?
.@SenBobCorker U exceeded TN's already low expectations of U today w/ur remark abt Ted Cruz. Shades of ur gutter campaign against H.Ford, Jr
@SenBobCorker how about you remember that you're from a Republican state & stop worrying about the dems. #BeatLamar first. #BeatBob is next
@SenBobCorker What are you doing about #Obamacare? When will #Republicans act like #Republicans?
@SenBobCorker Hey. I didn't go to Ivy League school either but Constitution written for ME. You took oath to defend it, so you best #Defund
@SenBobCorker I didn't either & I,too, can count. Check out our #obamacare #PartTimeNation #jobs #unemployment #PJNET
Dearest @SenBobCorker, how does funding the government shut down the government? Your gelatin spine is leaking all over your #RINO diapers.
@Rob_Cunningham Corker is a sellout. Spewing BS all over MSM lately; disconnected from conservative TN. He took oath to defend; so#defund
@SenBobCorker So what would you do?  Give up and quit?  Or do you have an actual alternative?
@SenBobCorker what is your plan? You are fleeing responsibility on bad legislation for the taxpayer! Again - what is your plan?
@SenBobCorker Good thing you weren't in Continental Congress.  We would still be English subjects.
@SenBobCorker @allahpundit Voting in favor of ObamaCare weakens the "position" of the American people. Choose. That is your job.
@SenBobCorker @allahpundit What is wrong with at least Delaying the Disaster?
@SenBobCorker you are a moron. Doesn't matter where you went to school.
THIS =====> “@teeocee: So, what's your plan? @SenBobCorker @allahpundit” #SurrenderCaucus
@SenBobCorker @emilyprollcall You are a stooge like McCain/Boehner/Cantor/Graham that Obama uses like toilet paper and i'm a social moderate
@DividendMaster @SenBobCorker @emilyprollcall  GOP hasn't learned how to WIN! These OLD Guards are afraid of the YOUNG GUNS in the Party.
@sassybarbara12 @SenBobCorker yup . @GOP senior citizens like McCain/Graham/Corker worse than DNC . Used by Obama like $2 whores
@SenBobCorker @hardball The problem with hiring mercenaries to play on your side is that they don't really care what happens to you.
Forget about political positions @SenBobCorker & focus on real cost of debt ceiling #stupidity. 2011 debate cost DJIA 17% @brianbeutler
@SenBobCorker interesting, you preface your comments by implying you're more more visual than visionary-i would argue, that's a stretch
@SenBobCorker you don't have a position. Listen to your people.
@SenBobCorker allowing Obamacare's implementation will bring our great economy to it's knees.  The GOP will be to blame if this happens.
@SenBobCorker Anything to Kiss O's azz right Corker. You better have him give you an appt because you are out next election.
@SenBobCorker You don't need the Ivy League education. What YOU need is a conscience, spine, and common sense. #DontFundIt
@SenBobCorker  meanwhile this guy i voted for wants to arm syrian rebels
.@SenBobCorker @CHRISMAL0NEY How much weaker can we get, darlin'? They're standing on our throats now.
@jackievasser @SenBobCorker  ACA is ghastly for America. Was voted for by all Dems,did not read bill, Americans against it. Defund it!!!
@SenBobCorker Well somebody's got to have the guts to get rid of this crap.
@SenBobCorker @HotlineJosh What is your proposal to prevent implementation of ACA, Senator? Your constituents and the American oppose it.
@SenBobCorker Thank you Sen. Bob.  You are one of the few grown-ups.  Just in Nashville, love your state!
@nancredding @SenBobCorker If by grown-up you mean lying liberal sissy, I agree.
@SenBobCorker Not a fan of defund, but our "position" seems to consist of bitching about OCare but doing nothing about it.
@sunnyright @SenBobCorker That's because the tail is wagging the #Gop dog - the tea nuts have handcuffed what was the Republican Party #Sad
@SenBobCorker just know you vote on Obama care you loose conservative votes.
@SenBobCorker Corker is a pandering Progressive party hack. Why don't you try helping them instead of just bitching. #DontFundIt
@SenBobCorker What is your position Mr. Amnesty?
