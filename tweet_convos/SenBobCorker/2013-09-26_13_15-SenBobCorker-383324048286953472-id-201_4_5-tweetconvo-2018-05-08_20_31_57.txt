I have liked @SenBobCorker  in the past, but I was appalled by his despicable attack of Ted Cruz's motives! Cruz is FAITHFUL to base @cspan
@dhiggins63 @SenBobCorker @cspan I agree. It's one thing to disagree, it's another to be a complete jerk while doing it. Disgraceful.
@robfit @cspan Harry Reid must be very proud of @SenBobCorker for using Reid's low-rent liberal tactics against fellow Republicans!
@dhiggins63 @robfit @cspan @SenBobCorker - You sure called that one right!  We are plenty mad at him here in TN. He embarrassed us all.
@mmoore229 @robfit @cspan @SenBobCorker It's why we need term limits. Longer they stay in DC, the less values they share with constituents!
@dhiggins63 @robfit @cspan @SenBobCorker - Well he might as well move there because he won't be received well back here in TN #firedup
.@SenBobCorker are you going to pay my insurance premium increase? #tcot

@SenBobCorker Sir I AM NOT confused! #DontFundIt #NoCloture #MakeDCListen
@SenBobCorker Way to bash the only Senators willing to speak for the 60% of us who want O'Care gone. We will remember in 2016 RINO
