MTP leftist groupthink and Trump bashing now unwatchable,  with little if any critical thinking. Today's show was the worst - and my last.
Unwatchable, yes but not for the reason u think.  Chuckie T just kneels 4 the GOTP. #LockHimUp #DeportDonald #TrumpIsABigot #NotWorthTheRisk
Will you have time on your dopey show to talk about Facebook colluding with the Clinton campaign?
I would watch Todd if you paid me, but he's exactly the kinda guy you'd promote.
please stop putting Trump puppets on TY. If you guys would stop giving the baby so much attention. He will shut up and go away .
No Chucky. You always bring on liberals or ANYONE has a beef with Trump. Do something with your hair. Looks ridiculous, a no hair Moe cut?
Why don't you talk to San Juan Mayor she seems reliable. Media gets played. She wants her 15 mins of fame at FEMA expense

Today's show was great! I love that you don't allow guests to lie and are willing to actually question them w/o fear of upsetting them.
Is military TWPS on the island of PR? Surrounded by sea, obvious solution. Create bottling facility, deliver by air and truck. Water for PR!
#fakerepublican on #fakenews perfect idiocy!
#NeverDJTHRC #NeverNeoLiberalNeoCons Hillary Clinton, by her own  account, talk other students out of protests War
No hispanics in his cabinet. Lashes out at an Hispanic working for her people. Rebuild? He owes PR 33 mil stolen in bankruptcy. Laundry?

Wow! Keep going, I learn every minute your reporting and discussing topics. John Olive does your show, but with humor. #MTP #1
Chuck Todd, the mayor is doing something fishy in PR. It seems she has her OWN agenda!Why is she the only one saying negative?She has agenda
Here's some stories Chuck WON'T be discussing this week:  
Mass shooting at TN church
Job growth & booming stock mkt
Terror attack in France
It's not a supply issue it's a distribution issue. Get the workers to work.

Chucky u didn't mention the hysterical mayor as stated by FEMA Director and a fellow mayor hasnt even shown up to FEMA headquarters meetings
great conversations today!!  thanks
Wouldn't miss Chuck Todd
Me neither,  if he fell off the earth.  Worthless tRump sucker, when he can find it #LockHimUp #DeportDonald #TrumpIsABigot #NotWorthTheRisk
The republican establishment party is over for corker..trump is draining the swamp.  Wish you aould have left years ago
Lots of fake news
.@chucktodd Don't be fooled by SykesCharlie's subtlety; he's a passive aggressive bully. His mouth gives him away.
#fanboys
#coolaiddrinkers
Be sure to report that the Democratic Mayor of San Juan REFUSES to attend meetings that ALL the other PR Mayors are attending?? WHY?
Thanks @SenBobCorker for keeping the lid on the spending party on the Hill. @realDonaldTrump has no filters. Keep them accountable. #MTP70
Mnuchin is another slippery robotic snake-oil salesman in the cabinet & that's why he's still around. Good job, Chuck Todd!
#Shattered Hillary Refuses To Accept #WhatHappened! #DNC Media Collusion Contines Trump #FakeNews Smears All Year!
#TeamTrump Trend #NextFakeTrumpSmear 
Hell HATH NO Fury as #Hillary's SCORNWitching starts @Morning_Joe @msnbc @NewDay @cnn NYT #Halloween 
2 weeks in a row no Democrats on the show, ridiculous
Trump could kill someone in the middle of 5th Avenue and Mnuchin would go on TV to defend it. he is the new kellyanne conway.
If it's Sunday it's Meet The Trash with Chuck Fraud.

Hey MSM, enough of the FAKE News Democrat Propaganda on #PuertoRico

Now the real news:

Fellow Puerto Rico Mayor Rips San Juan Mayor — ‘She’s Not Participating In Any Meetings’
Ha. May want to rework the intro. "Insight" and "Incite", you're using the two of them incorrectly.
At what point will you bother talking to anybody except republicans about taxes? It’s getting really old, Chuck.
Will you have any time on your dopey show to talk about Sen. Menendez and Debbie Wasserman Schultz?
It should be all about Puerto Rico.
Do the world a favor. Don't pull a Stettler! The truth is pouring out and he only gave full support to #veryfakenews with his race bait hate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=qocy-_VNJoQ …  At least mention this, maybe the Teamster in P.R a
, in between the Trump bashing, of course.
.dont b kind 2Steve needs 2take a ride at own expense
Bringing up a setting senator on trial for corruption?
Hope you're bringing up loss of CHIP for 9 million children.
I haven't watched your show for 11 months. Sorry your twisted views do not add understanding to the political world.
Bias show, don't watch
The #fakenews media has no credibility They are nothing but Liberal bias
LIGHT ON, BITCHES
Looking forward to a non Hugh show. He was terrible on MTPD last week. He adds nothing .
What the heck?  in #US, #FEMA has 2 be PAID? What is wrong with u ppl? Pay 4 disaster relief? take #EU model, FREE AID! #PuertoRicoReliefNOW
please don't let Mnuchin spew lies. Call him out if he does!
You're up early this morning, Chuck.
Can you ask them about the Mueller invest? Will they acknowledge RU interference and commit to action? Or continued collusion? #ImpeachTrump
I will not be watching. Used to watch MTP regularly , but no more! MTP panders to Left audience and has lost all credibility! What a shame!!
Should we expect more bias, fake, and hateful news? Nitpicking at the @realDonaldTrump what is the mayor managing in PR? Your face tells all
Oh great a second week in a row of Steve Mnuchin. The guy adds nothing to your show, lies on your airwaves, and has no credibility
How about talking about how Congress just let the CHIPS Program expire.  Now 9 MILLION babies/children are uninsured.
Can you buy a big red button that you press for each flagrant lie? Is the price of right horn available?
Chuck'd never be able to get a word out.
Munchin...no thanks, he is another lying swamper.
Penny what's in the bowl? Are you a John Olive fan?

PLease address: #JonesAct Waiver for 10 days, PR will need 2 rebuild & it will cost 20% more & keep #PR in debt! Repeal #JonesAct
when POTUS insults pow McCain he insults every soldier/pilot, same when he calls US troops "Killers, not innocent" akin to Putin. No patriot
Do ask @stevenmnuchin1  when he'll be paying us taxpayers back for his swamp creature actions??
Mnuchin should be the next out of touch billionaire to leave the administration.
Let's hope his vapid wife is soon thrown on a tumbrel
Steve is a crook tho.
Can you ask Mnuchin what happened to the human he stole his face from?
Hollywood men in black.. method acting gone awry
GIVE ME...SUGAR...IN WATER
fyi:
Try to be honest and accurate. The stories yesterday from networks were rife with errors.
Steve m? No thanks
You don’t want to watch him stick his foot in his mouth over and over?
Please talk PR
