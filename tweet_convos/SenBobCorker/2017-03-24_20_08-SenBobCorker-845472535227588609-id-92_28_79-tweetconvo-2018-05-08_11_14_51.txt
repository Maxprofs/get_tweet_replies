You would not be able to get coverage under Trump Care then.
Yes you would
#trumpdontcare   #trumpcarekills
You couldn't even  get health care for all Tennesseans, for shame.
Insurance companies' greed is the problem! Repair the #ACA don't repeal. Tell that to Trump!
Really, Senator? Well, you're wrong. The #ACA has provided millions with coverage. Repair #ACA don't repeal!
your statement is reasonable. Pls consider single payer. Tennesseans need better healthcare and better health practices
Senator, the bill would harm millions of children. We have made enormous progress in covering kids. We oppose AHCA. #DoNoHarm
, We voted 4 #FullRepealWe aren't worried about Ocare folks ins, that shdn't have it!not
@realDonaldTrump 
&DACA Amnesty?
Yall deaf to lies and cruelty.
how about meeting with Democrats to talk about resolving problems of the ACA? Did anyone consider that?
NO! They are still in obstruction mode. Trump or Die.
How about working to help regular Tennesseans NOT insurance companies? Repair ACA don't repeal!
how do you repair a system that kills doctor initiative w/10K deductible no one can afford-corrupt
What about Bob? Bob you've all had 8 years to put together a kick ass healthcare reform plan. So why this?
Yes! What have they been doing?
You guys know we can read, right? Trumpcare was an abomination! Seven years and that's what you wrote? Shame!
Now, @SenBobCorker, have convo about Independent Commission. Or you OK w/ foreign powers intervening in elections?
The American people demand – and deserve – the truth. Congress must create an independent commission to #FollowTheFacts on Russia. 
No news there, typical politics from a group that lost power because they wanted total gov control, dems are extremists
#affordable #adequate #accessible #cureCF
step one: support Medicaid expansion in TN
it's only broken in states that refused Medicaid exp. States that did have hired 70K in hospitals & thriving
TN Legislators sabotaged the ACA from go. They want Tennesseans to die, just ask Corker! #Loser
Great. Here's a guy you should talk to... @BernieSanders
expand Medicaid in Tn. There you go- done. Everyone's insured.
and Goons are going down, plenty of jail cells to go around! #TrumpFail #KilledTheBill #Loser #TrumpRussia 
A lot broken in State of TN. Legislators vote NOT to expand Medicaid. Even tho Gov Hasslen wanted to expand.
democrats have won on healthcare policy.
Fix ACA. Work across the aisle. Start with those states were there is just one Insurer.
MI took Medicaid expansion & has multiple ins to choose. Defunding to kill ACA wont work!
this constituent will not forget your lack of support for the poor & women next election!
Bob, Bob, Bob, ya just don't get it do ya?
single payer
You should be talking to us the people of TN. Stop playing politics with our healthcare
Great job Bob. You've really shown leadership on this issue... said NO ONE EVER. You all look like amateurs
make TN lawmakers cooperate with Obamacare, and it works, lowers premiums.  GOP clearly has no plan.  Sad!
Too late. GOP needs to move on. If ppl want Obamacare, let them drown with it. GOP blew their chance.
I agree- repair, don't repeal. Don't be spiteful & refuse to work on it because your effort didn't pass
I presume you left out, "@SenSanders and other industrialized countries are right, #SinglePayer #Medicaid will work for All!"
WHAT? Never heard your desire to work with both sides before--must have been some "nice talk."
Where have you been? You haven't made a meaningful statement about ACA.  Grow a pair! #yourbetterthanthat #FIXTHEACA
as a Republican myself, we MUST find a way to fix ROOT (costs), not treat symptoms.regulate supplier costs
That's how you do it Bob! No need to replace ACA just work together to improve- the framework is there!
how about you get your head out your carcass  and listen to fellow TN, or you will lose your seat in office!
37405 here; we're counting on your leadership and for u to stand by your statement! #HealthCareReform 
Remember to include women and children and the poor who are your constituents
did it look something like this? #killthebill
Heard on radio that you're colluding with bully Shumer. Is that true?
Trump wants a fair deal for all requiring input from all.  Give it to Americans to own.
Yes must repair the system, but Trumpcare didn't do it, was little more than tax cut for wealthy. Repair ACA.
Senator, show some leadership and work w/Dems for #medicare4all.
So did you ask him anything about Russia? Or are you in cahoots with him? Be an American, don't be blind!
it will take a statesman like you Senator to bring together both sides.
To be fair, Senator, your statement doesn't really say much.
Thank you Senator.  The partisan BS in Washington is getting really old.
Try doing something for the American people
. STILL ALL TALK.  Think it's time to drain the swamp on both sides.
We need Drs and hospitals on board to get this healthcare right....not Ins. Companies also, let go back again
Don't waste  your time on health care.  Investigate his ties with Putin. He's traitor.
What does Obama have on you?
Get back to work and get this item fixed for the people. GOP is the governing party don't start something you don't finish
how we #EndSlavery in #USA/world as per Corker #wallpaper, when you continue pay/#finance #HumanRights abuses
not  happy still no HC,&I work 34 to 40hrs still PT , can't afford , NONE n WH know our pain u r exempt
Holding you to this, Senator. I voted for you, but not for Trump. Reach across the aisle. Please. Protect access in East TN.
Oh, did u have a good talk?  Must have been hilarious.
You have had 8yrs-you have the majority. Can't blame the Democrats for this defeat.
THATS your FULL statement?! It's... three sentences long.
Start by remembering you represent the interest of the people.  This is not a business.
so are you willing to come to the table w/ Dems on 'fixing' ACA? Or do you want full repeal?
We have to go national health care. We are going to end up there eventually. All the kids are doing it.
- yes, on BOTH sides of aisle. It's not a popularity contest but our lives.
take a break. Leave the ACA alone for 2017. Get some wins elsewhere. Fix Obamacare in 2018.
How can you be proud of that? TrumpCare was only about a dollar for the wealthy, not real people who need it.
Useless talk, stay away from any members of freedom caucus.
Did you ask him about Russia? #Trumprussia
Drop the false Russia narrative & move on. No evidence found - what part of that don't you get?
Preserve and Improve.
#BYEBOB
Just proves that he and the rest of the Repugs have been full of pucky the whole time.
Great, the Dems are ready to work with the @GOP If DTs #TaxReturns come up again for a vote, vote YES!
this is sad!
@All100Senators @realDonaldTrump You sir, are stuck in your 60s. You should get your mind out of the 1950s, and think beyond u
Don't give up!!!
stand up for us
"At some point"? Do you really believe that this version of #Trumpcare was in the best interest of the American ppl? Really?
It would have been better if @POTUS & you had shown some leadership by working both sides of the aisle BEFORE
zzzz #TermLimits
All for some term limits on these individuals working against American people.
