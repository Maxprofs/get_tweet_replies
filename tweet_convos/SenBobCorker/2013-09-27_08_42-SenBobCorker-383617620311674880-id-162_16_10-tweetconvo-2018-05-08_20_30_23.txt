@SenBobCorker As YOUR EMPLOYER I am Instructing You to Vote NO on Cloture. Make Democrats accept the CR as is, Funding the Govt But Not ACA
@dorothy1961 @SenBobCorker lol....Yawn... Wait for it.... Lol
@SenBobCorker We the People do not want ObamaCare so do not play word games with us. The Dems can not reelect you.
@SenBobCorker You are a rhino.I hope the good people of Tn are with me and vote you out of office.
“@rsts82: @SenBobCorker You are a rhino.I hope the good people of Tn are with me and vote you out of office.”
@SenBobCorker Corker needs to ensure us all that he is voting NO. His remarks yesterday made me skeptical on whether we can trust him
@leslie_holloway @SenBobCorker   He can't be trusted. He won't do the will of the people. He's there for His Self Gain!
@lookupfolks @SenBobCorker he disgusts me. Betraying the American people one vote at a time
@leslie_holloway @SenBobCorker  We won't forget when re-election time comes around.
@SenBobCorker Voting WITH Harry Reid and the Democrats
 For Cloture IS NOT a vote to #defundobamacare!
@SenBobCorker YOU DIDN'T VOTE TO DEFUND OBAMACARE!!! YOU'RE AN IDIOT! YOU VOTED YES ON CLOTURE WITH HARRY REID, YOU VOTED TO FUND OBAMACARE!
@SherryLynn5876 @SenBobCorker ACA is mandatory funding even if u vote to defund it's still funded... Duh...
@Roostaah2 @SherryLynn5876 @SenBobCorker Ah, no its not, not if its voted to be de-funded, it just won't be funded...Duh
@SherryLynn7658 @SherryLynn5876 @SenBobCorker not apart of budget. It's mandatory spending .. Guess what. It's not going anywhere getoverit
@SenBobCorker YOU AND MCAIN WERE WRONG, THE PEOPLE WANT OUT, CONGRESS OPTED OUT, WHY, WE KNOW
VOTE TO DELAY AND FIGHT FOR IT.
we are watchin
@SenBobCorker , you're quite the gutless turd!! If you want mindless idiots for constituents, gather some liberals together!
@Bidenshairplugs @SenBobCorker no we are not #MakeDCListen
@SenBobCorker you should have had our interest first and formost instead of drinking the water in Washington
@SenBobCorker At least if I vote for a Democrat, I know he is lying. You, I can't tell. Maybe time to switch.
@SenBobCorker thank you for your vote. Do not listen to the major media. Americans do not want Obamacare. This American is ok w a shut down
@SenBobCorker When you ask for my vote the answer will be NO...I am sick of you...OBAMAS PUPPET
@SenBobCorker You traitorous RINO! Grow a sack, find some integrity.
@SenBobCorker Instead of explaining ur vote today to delay, dismantle, repeal & replace Obamacare. Mayb u should explain why u voted w/ Reid
@SenBobCorker I hope that Republicans hold the Dems an Pres. Obama responseable 4 how they r RUining our Country.
@SenBobCorker.  No obamacare. No compromise. Or NO in nxt election
@SenBobCorker By the way, that picture up top, of you on the phone...wow! You look super busy and important! You must be SO honest, really!
@SenBobCorker I tried to call you. You took your phone off the hook. Your voicemail is FULL. You voted no. ;(  You do not support TN.
@SenBobCorker Totally disappointed Tennessee Reps are bowing to this middle class destroyer. Next they'll be voting to work out of a Mosque.
@SenBobCorker You will not have to worry about a thing because "we the people"aka the country will not reelect you. Can Dems elect you?
@SenBobCorker Please reject House CR, as it also slashes CHIP by 70% effective tomorrow & would put health of millions of kids at risk.
@SenBobCorker Sen. Corker - really had high hopes for you, very disappointed that you did not support Sen. Cruz's effort.
@SenBobCorker obama care is the law of the land what part of that dont u understand
@SenBobCorker
@SenBobCorker If you worked in my company in mgmt position I would FIRE YOU MR GET BACK INTO LINE.
@SenBobCorker You need to hear the calls of those who Voted For You! This will be your Legacy! Very Sad especially when I Voted for you!
@SenBobCorker Your vote for Cloture was a vote for Obamacare. U knew 47 Rs voting 2 Defund was futile. So don't tell us U oppose Obamacare
@SenBobCorker That's a lie. I got an email from your office stating defunding the ACA is a waste of time!
.@SenBobCorker If it walks like a duck, & quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck. Guess how we can tell a RINO? #dontfundit #ObamaCare
@SenBobCorker @yrwol7 Need to vote out incumbents that vote for crap we USA don't like!
@SenBobCorker~You did no such thing!I saw you on CSPAN today making a fool of yourself! It was very clear you're for falling in line w/Harry
@SenBobCorker Ashamed of this mess,news said GOv.will not shut down, has a 45 day extension!WE DON'T WANT OBAMACARE! DON'T YA'LL GET IT? NO!
“@SenBobCorker: Answering calls about today’s vote" ” / ¿Adónde llamamos a @mario_delgado1 y @Ale_BarralesM ?
@SenBobCorker You deserve a pink slip!  You aren't listening to what we Americans REALLY want!
@SenBobCorker Why did you vote FOR cloture? That was basically a vote FOR ObamaCare! Think your TN constituents aren't watching? We are!
@SenBobCorker - you voted today and I'll be voting next election. Should you and other RINO's be concerned?
@SenBobCorker Here's a view: you're a fucking coward & you are in your last term.  You will have a conservative primary challenge RINO!
@SenBobCorker Your vote for cloture was a vote for Obamacare, We will not be mislead by you,very disappointed
@SenBobCorker #liar #obamacare
@SenBobCorker RINO!!!
@PLUM_PERPLEXED @SenBobCorker @jstines3 and @JohnCornyn as well.
@DougHarrisIII @SenBobCorker @jstines3 @JohnCornyn don't worry Doug, I named them all!
@SenBobCorker Tsk tsk...We tried to tell you. CHOICES HAVE CONSEQUENCES. 
Don't get too comfortable, hun...you won't be staying long.
@SenBobCorker Tea Party created a monster. Once set loose, it's really hard getting it back in it's cage, don't you think?
@SenBobCorker Sir this is NOT what you did 2day.  U've let ur country down & have disgraced the @GOP.  Know that this will be remembered.
@SenBobCorker You are a liar. The people of Tennessee deserve better!!
@SenBobCorker A vote for cloture is a vote for Obamacare. you and Alexander sucks both voted yea we wont forget either of you losers
@SenBobCorker your Pathetic Rino why hide your not a conservative what so ever!!!!! So basically you don't give a flyin rats ass about us !
@SenBobCorker we shall not forget I will guarantee you that
@SenBobCorker your disingenuous attempt to claim you voted against Obamacare is not flying.  You chose Harry Reid over Ted Cruz #rino
@SenBobCorker Are you on the phone w/someone brushing you up on senate procedures? That would help avoid embarrassments like yest. Poor TN (
@SenBobCorker really disappointed in u... pandering to harry reed when u should be standing with a true conservative like ted cruze
@SenBobCorker  One question, having heard yes you did - no you didn't vote with Obama or the Republican House?  Answer needed.
@SenBobCorker your full of crap you voted agents the CRA. Play your games but know this I will not vote for you.
@SenBobCorker Thank you for proving Sen. Cruz is a man go sincere integrity
@SenBobCorker It's a wonder you can answer the phone with all that BS coming out of your mouth, LIAR!
@SenBobCorker you are a disgrace to TN. You will not get my vote again. Listen to the American people!!
@SenBobCorker why don't you tweet that you voted with McCain and the rest of the democrats?
@SenBobCorker LIES on LIES!  IT WAS A SHOW VOTE ONLY! Your vote will now enable @HarryReid 2 make amendment & strip the DEFUNDING out of CR.
@SenBobCorker Here's my view: YOU SUCK! Nothing worse than DC RINOs doing the opposite of the peoples will. We won't forget.
@SenBobCorker it looks like at this point I've seen 1 tweet supporting you, way to listen to We The People
@SenBobCorker when you vote with the democrats you are on the wrong side. You supported OC today
@SenBobCorker Lost my vote and my $
@SenBobCorker You are done, pack your bags in 2014 big boy.
@SenBobCorker So, hand Reid the means to make your "NO" vote possible and futile. RINO.
@SenBobCorker . Why am I not surprised you voted yes?Us pesky constituents keep getting in your way, eh?
@MemphisGunOwner We needed you last year.  Corkscrew is not up again 'til 2018
.@SenBobCorker Ur constituents r smarter than u think. U voted FOR cloture w/ Harry Reid n Obama! We will not forgive or forget! #traitor

@toni_toniham @TPartyGuy @SenBobCorker @SenAlexander #ShowVoting RINO's
@SenBobCorker Wow what an embarrassment, that debate with Cruz showed you have no idea what you're even doing in Congress.
@SenBobCorker  You failed to do your job, to represent the Citizens of Tennessee.
 We should have the Power to recall you.
@SenBobCorker How embarrassing, you didn't even know the diff as to voting for cloture or not. NO WAS THE ANSWER. YOU JUST VOTED TO FUND OC!
@SenBobCorker You think tweeting this CRAP will fool people. Your actions prove you are Dem, just not honest enough to admit it. #TeaParty
@SenBobCorker From Alabama..that CR is coming back atcha'..Cruz said Senate is filled with professional magicians.
@SenBobCorker This was the Alamo and you failed to help http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/25/carson-the-grit-and-gumption-to-resist-obamacare/ … #MakeDCListen
@SenBobCorker Pitiful
@SenBobCorker OMG...what a joke.  He voted with Harry Reid to fund it.
@SenBobCorker You where NOT one of the Senators that voted against cloture so congratulations! You funded Obamacare #rinoalert #MakeDCListen
@SenBobCorker What? You voted with @SenatorReid & @SenFeinstein According to your logic they voted to #DefundObamacare too. #MakeDCListen
@SenBobCorker I voted for you and you FAILED me! I will NEVER vote for you again!
@SenBobCorker PEOPLE HAVE JUST AS GOOD A PHOTO OF YOU BEING SILENT NOW SEN.  AS YOU WERE ON THE PHONE SUPPOSEDLY WITH YOUR CONSTITUENTS
@SenBobCorker -- no campaign contrib. 2 u from us thru RNC.  We will contribute directly to #teaparty candidates & vote in primaries.
@SenBobCorker Look at your replies Senator.  No one in your state is for the ACA.  You supported it by voting yes for Cloture on the CR.
@SenBobCorker R'member how stupid J Kerry looked when said he voted for a bill before voting against it? You just did the same thing idiot.
@liberty4meplz Also remember that @SenBobCorker voted 'yea' to confirm same idiot Kerry.
@MotherGoos3 @SenBobCorker 'Stupid Party' confirmed...
@liberty4meplz That's exactly what I call them. Donks are evil and repubs are stupid. All we're left with is a few like Cruz @SenBobCorker
@SenBobCorker You sir are being dishonest. You knew that voting yes for Cloture = voting no on defunding, plz don't treat us like fools.
@SenBobCorker a simple request from a constituent, do whatever you have to to defund Obamacare. We don't want gov't controlling our lives.
@SenBobCorker Guess Obama will take you golfing again. You have embarrassed the state you should represent. After Lamar loses, you are next.
@SenBobCorker whimp
@SenBobCorker Nice display ystd. Could have helped me keep my plan w/a No vote today.Q: can you stash me on your congressional health plan?
@SenBobCorker You didn't vote for America and the for we will not vote for you! Sad but your done
I will not vote for @SenBobCorker in the next election. If you don't carry out the will of your constituents, you lose your job.
@SenBobCorker   TN wants people who listen to their constituents NOT to Harry Reid.  Time to retire.
@SenBobCorker Ted Cruz told you exactly how this was going to go, but in all your wisdom you still voted with Democrats to fund Obamacare.
@SenBobCorker Please vote to defund Obamacare.  The nations economy depends upon it.
@SenBobCorker You answered the call but didn't listen.  Please get primaried!
@SenBobCorker and thanks for showing who exactly you chose to stand with. LMAO if you, sir, try to say you voted to #DefundObamacare.
@Shaughn_A That's exactly what both @SenBobCorker and @SenAlexander are doing.  They think we're stupid.
@SenBobCorker Have you even read your timeline?  There is absolutely NO support for what you did today. #TN
@SenBobCorker Thank you for being a voice of reason last night. Please take it 1 step further and support health ins for all.
@SenBobCorker Did I just hear you voted yes ?!? Are you kidding me ?! Get your resume out,your gonna need to start shopping for a new job !
@SenBobCorker You need to handle up your business.
You ran as a conservative, now act like one....

@SenBobCorker Keep in mind. Our memories will not be so short on such a grave error this time.
@SenBobCorker ..sure hope you do vote to defund it..
@SenBobCorker Sen Corker.... I truly hope you are not in favor of supporting Obama Care.
. @SenBobCorker This is not the 1st cloture vote you've gotten wrong.The cloture vote IS the vote that allows bad legislation to pass.
@SenBobCorker This is an outright lie! We're not idiots!
@SenBobCorker I feel that you are betraying what we sent you to Washington to do. Disappointed with his recent remarks.
@SenBobCorker Yes god forbid people get affordable health care...FYI premiums in TN will be the lowest in the country.
@SenBobCorker You got to do something quick.You are starting to look and sound like a southern Sen. Reid
@SenBobCorker Obama Care is a Red Line. It is un-American and un-Constitutional. If you do not fight... the people will remove you.
@SenBobCorker  Vote NO on cloture.  Listen to the people not senile Harry Reid
@SenBobCorker   Don't humor us, just vote for us! Vote No to Obamacare.
@SenBobCorker we're not stupid. We know the diff bet yesterday's vote & today's vote. NO on cloture empowers the people not Harry Reid!
. @SenBobCorker Caption SHOULD READ "Sen. Corker (Mr. Confusion) planning his next attack on @SenTedCruz & the American People". #NoCloture
.@SenBobCorker Photo Opp?  NO Cloture!  WE don't want #obamacare.  That is plain.
@SenBobCorker Traitor

@SenBobCorker No to cloture!
@SenBobCorker SEND OUT A PUBLIC TWEET THAT YOU ARE VOTING NO ON CLOTURE ,CORKER ! WHY CAN'T YOU DO THIS ? IF CORKER VOTES YES , HE'S FOR ACA
@JimKidwell1 Corker obviously thinks/knows everybody in TN is dumb as a rock in telling them his YES on cloture is a no vote on Obamacare
@SenBobCorker Let Reid do the work to guarantee closing debate means no further changes. Vote no on cloture until he does. #MakeDCListen
.@SenBobCorker Pan around the room so we can see the children of today working as his slaves b/c he is a #BigGovtProgressive
@SenBobCorker I hope you know that a vote for cloture is a vote for Obamacare. Ted explained it to you.
