You are becoming another John McCain. Sad that you refuse to support our President.
It's you that's the problem.

DJT is an fraudulent abomination. An incompetent whiny manbaby not worthy of the office of the POTUS. #fact
Guess you want that Muslim back. Right?
Guess you want your brain back from Breitbart, right?
Cute comeback, but doesn't trigger me.
BTW, "that muslim" got 57% from FN & 62% from Rasmussen.

When the incompetent manbaby you call "president" gets those numbers, then talk ;)

Why do y'all "Christians" praise Jesus in one breath & spit in his face in the next breath by supporting DJT? #fakeChristian #hypocrites
Thank you Senator Corker for putting country ahead of party, by TELLING the TRUTH. 
Now that's funny!!
How many times did you vote to raise the debt ceiling and don't tell me that isn't related to the deficit?
It isn’t.  It’s voting to pay past bills instead of defaulting.
Tell that to your banker and see how far it gets you.  The debt ceiling is like raising your CC limit to pay for what you just borrowed.
No... it’s paying your credit card bill.
Good luck in your accounting career.
RINO
Did trump lie about cutting Medicaid and Medicare for his own voters? Or just cuts for blue states @cagop #cagop #VelshiRuhle @maddow #AMJoy
U will always b on rt. side of history/ hope u will reconsider leaving Senate- Thk/U!!
Step down your embarrassing yourself
So agree, no more DEBT
#RecuseYourself. You can't in good conscience vote on a bill that lines your pocket.

#CorkerKickback
RINO...go away....
ONE ON ONE IDIOCY DOING THE CIRCLE JERK.
Corker forgets he is there for the people and NOT to line his pockets from the lobbyist.
Please keep your word! Don't back down. Dont raise the lowest rate from 10 to 12%
Tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of middle & poor does not strengthen an economy or a nation. That's why you shouldn't support it!
You would!
you are a liberal... resign
Your love affair with the enemy press may make you feel special. Pass the agenda or get gone. We dont need back stabbers like you in office
Thank you! Finally a voice of reason and restraint in spending.
They have added 10 trillion to the deficit over the last 8 years and NOW he is worried about spending  Go Away BOB
Tick Tock Bob
#InvestigateBobCorkersFinances
WHERE THE PHUK WERE YOU THE PAST TEN YEARS?!
Your a RINO, glad your leaving.
Don't add to the deficit but don't cut spending to give the folks a tax cut. Yep, that sounds like a plan, just keeps sticking it to us.
I’m left of center... but like you, I’m a deficit hawk and applaud your responsibility on the issue.  You’ll be missed in the senate
You are in love! How cute. Swamp creatures are so cute and corruptible together.
Reconsider leaving office. Although I am a Democrat I have ALWAYS respected you.
I am with u!

Trump effect!
imagine if you ever attacked corrupt dems like you attack republicans corker
Please do something to get Trump under control before he starts a nuclear war or ignites a civil rights uprising in the states.
Of course out of spite for Trump you are just like @SenJohnMcCain you don't want to help Americans! Cant wait till that smelly swamp is drained
Nothing is enjoyable as long as they come out of your mouth ..senator!
Why? Did he hold your liddle hand while you guys were bonding?
YOU WOULD NOT SUPPORT ANYTHING OUR PRESIDENT DOES. TENNESSEE NOT MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU OR YOUR FEELINGS ITS WHAT MATTERS
Please run for President. Trump is a disgrace to our country, an embarrassment to Congress. I'm losing faith in nationalism. Get Trump out
Corker cares more about Iran getting a nuclear weapon than he does Americans. Resign now.
@SenBobCorker 
Then why did you allow Obama to run up the deficit almost 10 Trillion over his 8 year regime?  You are a Democrat in disguise
To save it from what W did to our economy. You know, same thing Bannon & Trump are working on doing again.
Thank you for your fiscal conservatism & good sense...
LOL!!
Can’t stand to look at traitor Corker! So sorry I voted for him in TN! Never again!
and you helped give us the iran agreement
after years of blowing up the deficit with continuing resolutions under obama, all of a sudden corker is a deficit hawk
Did you notice @POTUS refuses to pay $8 Billion paid by his predecessor due to the Constitution that prohibits what Obama did?@SenJohnMcCain
I just love when Republicans sweeten up to left leaning media and then when we really need to win a national election, that media jerks us.
So, you are out to HOSE the balance of the Republicans that WANT a tax cut? I'm glad you are leaving the Senate.
This is the same nonsense as the heathcare fiasco. The PERFECT IS THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD. All excuses to thwart TRUMP an stick it to us. BOO/

Thank you.  Please stick to your guns and vote no on Trump Tax Plan.
#NeverDJTHRC #NeverNeoLiberalNeoCons Hillary Clinton, by her own  account, talk other students out of protests War
RINOS doing what they do best! Chucklehead and RINOS go well together with whining!#TermLimits
#MagnitskyAct NOW DO YOUR JOB. Neither nor the Koch’s will protect you from putin. Quit #TeamTreason & protect
Just curious, why the sudden concern for the deficit?
@chucktodd is a FAKENEWS HACK!  I guess when U R desperate for attention you will sleep with anyone huh Bob!? #USELESSBOB #FAKENEWS #TRAITOR
If you refuse to do your job, retire.  Why we are we paying a mint to do nothing Bob?
wish you were as tough on Obama as you are on Trump. you are a swamp monster and do not give a damn about what is best for America
Resign now Mr corker you have shown your contempt for your fello Tennesseans!

didn't hear you complain when Obama ran us in debt more than all the rest of the presidents put together, and we got nothing for it.
You have received my last vote forever
hmmm, help with the Iran deal but won't support tax cuts.
That is because you are a equal with him. Both hate GOP and like RHINOS.
so now you are concerned about the deficit, which has been going up for many yrs, sure its not a resist trump reason u don't want tax reform
You're still on the job, so do something about Trump's blatant disregard for Russian Sanctions.
Got nothing for Chuck POS Todd, he’s not a reliable reporter, commentator, or much of anything.
Awe you are a democrat
Are you actively working toward mounting consensus for his removal from office? If not, thanks but it's not what we need.
It's a start.
If you Republicans don’t get on board and start getting things pass with President Trump you’re out of a job shameful
So democrats big money got to u now...tax cut will help Americans, u better vote the way we tell u...get on board r get out 4 capable people
Senator Robert Corker, it's TIME for a big SEND-OFF for Trump. Is Trump headed to WAR? Danger level high. TIME TO " Drain the Swamp ".
The Republicans 9 page Tax Plan will benefit the top 1% & balloon the deficit by billions of dollars. 9 pages of appalling legislation...
The PACS from Texas threatened to close the " Piggy Bank", & the checkbook if they don't get their Tax Cuts, & their agenda passed.
Trump said the Tax Plan helps the middle-class, I don't believe this. The Republicans Tax Plan will be geared towards the Wealthy.
By telling the truth & putting the Country & the people 1st, thank you. Trump & his Jet-Setters damaged so much it will take a long time...
Senator Robert Corker, I'm sure the Republicans  Tax Plan isnt to behoove working & middle-class taxpayers. Cuts to Medicare and Medicaid?
Resign
U fit right in with chuck Todd and the NYT ur no republican resign now let @VoteMarsha have ur spot so we can actually get something done
Bob Corker the new darling of the Left. Sad final chapter for this guy.
Glad I missed this one. You stink and need to get out NOW
Reckoning is here Bobbie your RINO buds are toast, You're the problem an you should resign. Keep attacking #potus and see him kick a$$ #maga
Stand tall.  The Trump tax plan is a farce.
As Senator Corker is fond of saying, that’s a lot of malarkey. Read more at:
#RenewJonesActWaiver
Put a Cork in Senator. All you're doing is showing how very small you are... Perhaps your resignation IS the right thing for the country...
Resign...Dont think for a minute that trashing @POTUS will make you popular..Liberals are small paid group with big microphone
You'll keep us in this 2% or less 'growth' forever. Release us small business people & the us econ. short term deficit for long term growth.
The American People aren't paying you to be disrespectful to our POTUS! Asserting World War III was highly irresponsible! Plz resign now!
You are indeed acting like a petulant child & most likely because you didn't get the Secy of State job! You certainly don't represent MAGA!
of course you did - you Liberals think alike! #MAGA
I'm sure you are really comfortable being on CNN or MSNBC or other anti-Trump stations. Typical RINO, good riddance.
Just another fake !
But u supported Obama despite that he nearly doubled the National Debt!!!  Interesting...God forbid the middle-class would benefit from this
I bet you did Chuck Todd is moron Fake News so called journalist
the fact that you “enjoyed” a MTP anything tells us what a sell out do-nothing stand-for-nothing Senator you became, a Washington creature
Resign now.....help speed up the process of you getting out of the Senate. We don't need you. You are an obstacle to the GOP. Bye.
Senator, if you were running 4 re-election, would you have spoken out?
Just great. You gewt along with MSNBC more than our freely elected President.
Why wouldn't you enjoy a conversation with Chuck Todd?  You're cut from the same cloth.
Corker finally where he always belonged. Bye Bob.
Donald Trump knows the meaning of the words Public Servant: to perform the will of the people (keep law and order). Bob Corker lost $20 TRIL
Again proof You are saying to OUR #POTUS is You Bob are Anti-Citizens, Legal immigrants, Liberty,Freedom, Constitution, Amendments, Bill of Rights person.  Thanks for clearing it up with your tweet to @WhiteHouse. #DeepState #SwampDweller.
Get your ads out
Just like songbird John, both bowing to the Dems. What is wrong with Republicans? You and McCain are destroying the Party.
Nice that you enjoyed the conversation with the Obama mouthpiece, showing more of your resolve to destroy this country.
What has happened to common sense conservatives like Bob Corker? A dying breed and the primary reason I switched from GOP to Independent.
Do something Americans will thank you for, get @SpeakerRyan a spine so he starts impeachment proceedings!!!
It's a fallacy.   Corporations give out bigger dividends,  do stock buybacks,  park it in investments.  @GOP WAKE UP!! @TheDemocrats
PS.  I'm a CPA.   It WILL add to it.  Lower taxes NEVER CREATES ENOUGH REVENUE to make up for the cuts.
Chuck Todd? No thank you
Corker and Todd both suck!
Your candor is so refreshing!  I would vote for you and I'm not Repub.  Stay the course.
Yet you supported Obama's !!!!
Of course you did, you liberals like to stick together.
Rino
of course he wont'! He is a demencrat under the thin veneer.. he has done this for months now betraying all of us again & again. SCUM
You should be ashamed, sir! Letting ppl in your state who voted for tax cuts down like that! Hurting ppl, not Trump! #greed
But kissed Obama every time he added another trillion to deficit!
Just go away & take McCain, McConnell, Ryan & all other RINO’S with you!
Nobody wants to see you or hear you. Leave already. Swamp
Yes we cannot afford to balloon the deficit for billionaires, thank you!
Thank you for showing spine.
your a dam traitor
“A lot of rhetoric” Yeah #Fanniegate kicked your crooked rino ass! Then @BreitbartNews did you in for good. @realDonaldTrump is in fact #dts
#traitor to American people you will be voted out.
That’s really special Bob.
Please stick to this. My weak senators @tedcruz & JC  are kissing Trump's behind instead of helping children, small businesses and seniors.
of course you did.

Progressives always get along well with other progressives.
...and "only" 10 years in the Senate "increasing the budget?" now complaining about it!  Looks like and smells like - must be a RINO.
Thanks Gents, great interview.  Senator Corker, please consider a 2020 WH run.  We need you!!  DJT will be gone & Pence has been T's Lapdog.
I can respect you if you help change the biggest problem of all! President Trump should not be the President! Please get him out before u go
Making the rich richer and the middle class poorer! Vote against it for the correct reason. Support the people that have paid your bills!
I am sorry to say that this President is the worst mistake America has ever made! We don’t have a President we have a joke! God help us all!
Sir the election in Alabama and Moore reflex’s poorly on the Republican Party as a whole. You are smart to leave this mess.
Good job.  Tax cuts not a good reason to run deficits during low unemployment.
...and this. #corkerforsenate. Please.
Trump destroyed you brah
The GOP tax plan is a Scam,A Gift to Trump and the Rich while the working Class pays for it/
RT Corker is just Another RINO! I am glad he is Leaving! Now McCain needs gone!!
He makes me ashamed to admit I’m from Tennessee!
So, according to NBC, you don't care about economic growth.
. Going out with a blast I see, you could’ve been classy Bob Corker shame on you.
Sure you did. You are behaving like a petulant child because you didn't get the job. Get over it. Do us all a favor & quit now!!
you made my decade w/ this interview, &11:45 on tells the world you're determined to help us ALL before you go - and after!
You mean the deficit you created, Senator? Now you're leaving the Middle Class holding the bag? Just go!
#GunControlNow
We see through him clearly.  Member of Hillary's Opposition.  Useless for Americans.
Tax cuts are cuts so you are making no sense.  The growth in the economy and reduction in unemployment and welfare must be considered.  Remember Reagan?
You're worried about the deficit now?  It doubled under Obama, and you DID NOTHING!  You are a RINO traitor!  Glad you're calling it quits.
of course you enjoyed being on that idiots show....how many times did speak against your own paty's President???
True colors coming out  Bob. Kiss Nancy and Chuck's butt and go out with your real party members. Fake GOP representative.  #pelosifan
Tax cuts don't necessarily bring good times,  especially 5yrs after...
1% give aways don't help either...
do you hear yourself? This twatwaffle is putting all our lives in danger. 25th Amendment Now!!!
People like you are wolves in sheep's clothing. You are scarier than Liberians because you hide behind the GOP as a conservative you are not
Never thought I would say this about you but you are disgraceful with some of your comments about our president. Shamefull.  RINO
I bet u did! Real darling of the left since selling out America facilitating Obama Iranian giveaway! U quit because u cant win reelection.
I wish I had my vote 4U back. You were a fairly good man until you fell in with the thieves in the District of Corruption. You're nobody now
Unbelievable tool for the left. You disrespect the President without concrete reasons. Stand for more than the applause of liberal elites!
Don’t look now but Corker is shaping up to be for tax cuts what @SenJohnMcCain  was for hcare. Is @SenateGOP the new @DNC?! #Resist 
If the tax reform bill cuts gov't revenues, it will add to the deficit. 
Gov Brownback & Pres's Reagan & both Bushes proved that.
#TaxReform
You left Obama's giant arrow throwing us into massive debt.  Obama is the worst president ever
Bobby glad you are retiring. Get out before you are kicked out for being a fraud. Just think, People will ask who is Corker? Who? A nobody.
Be honest, only reason u don't support is  because of your open hatred of OUR/YOUR  President. Just resign now and do us all a favor
I know what they will probably do: cut aid to the poor & to children, just like you just did with the CHIP program for children The rich win
Prove that you actually will do this. They have no way to make enough cuts elsewhere to provide the rich & corporations with huge tax cuts!
The tax reform will add TRILLIONS to the deficit! Everyone knows that. The rich want huge tax cuts at the expense of a huge deficit. WRONG
That's what Obama did! Added trillions $$ to deficit!
Don't go,please don't go
Yes, Go! Part of the swamp! #Manning #2018
PASS THE TAX BILL
Thank you for your service. Agree or disagree, I am thankful for your service to our democracy!
Me Corker the President of USA deserves a lot of respect for his handling of overwhelming events http://lately.Show  him some respect!
Of course you did, you Democrats like to stick together.  Ugh..
Bwahahaha And you all love to SCREW the 99%
It will and doesn't even benefit the majority of Americans. It's a collect on an IOU to the Donor class and you probably already know that.
Maybe the GOP who do not agree with Trump should speck up.   Tax reform is a house of lies: http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2017/09/tax_reform_is_one_big_lie.html?wpsrc=sh_all_dt_tw_top … … … via @slate
You lied to get into office...U r much more Lib Dem that Republican.  U knew people were vote for the R's U took advantage.
Thats why you need to leave. Rather than help the citizens, you can only object to @realDonaldTrump.  Another pathetic RINO.
You are not a concertive period cause you are for yourself
