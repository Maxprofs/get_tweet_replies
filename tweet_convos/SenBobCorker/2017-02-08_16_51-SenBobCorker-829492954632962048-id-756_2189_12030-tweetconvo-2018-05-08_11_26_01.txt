.@SenBobCorker Proud to ignore your constituents calls? Would love to know the number you received urging you to vote NO. You're out in 2018
LMAO the number  the Senate has more republican that show up everyday ..
So is that one Republican? Not sure based on your spelling. You must've been in support of DeVos.
yes mam as a teacher .. I hate the academic studies today what happened to cursive and 1+1=2  and actual studies
and grammar, like what is that?
, lol petty pitty party liberal; is what it is ....grammar really , I would have wished high school only taught u more
it taught me how to spell "you." #winning
dear you can only say so much ... so get a fucking grip ...
@SenAlexander  @SenatorSessions enjoy your last terms. Next election you'll be out. You're supposed to represent me, not $$$.
he represents everyone not just U I  applaud his vote  not all see it your way.
Exactly. They should represent EVERYONE.
Tn is a deep red state our Sen Corker has no worries.
hasn't always been red can turn blue again. What comes round goes around
u are incorrect TN has gone blue as recent as 96 but u wanted to be bout race
.@SenBobCorker's office refused to share any data of constituents in favor of vs against Sessions. Said "we don't share that information."
since you went against the will of your own state, I will be happy to vote against you in 2018
since Trump won Tennessee what do you think the odds are of that happening?
pretty high considering the number of protests starting to happen ! :)
LMAO. A bunch of petulant children wasting time.
wow, ppl that didn't vote for Trump r protesting. Big f-ing deal.
don't you know that standing in the street for hours has a real impact?
really? You don't think protesting had anything to do with the immigration ban going to court in WA?
nope, only reason Side Show Bob (WA AG) went 2 court 2 make a name for himself. Didn't care b4 DT.
@norvilgirl @SenatorSessions
He's a racist little turd and your support abets that. Way to sell out Justice on party lines.
Hahaha. Remember when you said this?
@POTUS still loving your criminal nomination now. Fools
Proud to support a racist? Why?
Sen Sessions has done MORE for Af Americans than ALL of  left wing lunatic Democrats COMBINED!!
Well if you use all those caps, I must believe it!
read, youll save em dying braincells
Maybe I should read some of the racist drivel you post. Have fun w/ your ignorance!
Thank you! Drain the swamp please
@POTUS  After what you pulled with @SenWarren you're losing votes in TN. Just wait until your numbers come in. Terrible.
@POTUS @SenatorSessions BOOOOOOO!!!
@POTUS pls remember big picture vs party when voting on budget cuts for EPA etc.
I find you and your party sad and that you don't give a damn about America in general.
.@SenBobCorker @SenatorSessions #Tennessee personal #Liberty infringed upon by Nanny State #marijuana prohibition #GetOutOfMyLife #GoVoteTN
@norvilgirl @SenatorSessions Rest of the Rep. Party better get behind Trump & do it now... 22 demo seats GONE in 2018
@POTUS @SenatorSessions keep being proud, cause you're out come election time
@POTUS @SenatorSessions # Corrupt Work that is from the Munchkin
@POTUS @jeffsessions THE WHITE PEOPLE AG
Lol, you are assuming he ever had a soul. Signed pissed  off Tennessee voter.
@POTUS @SenatorSessions eye rolls #Wearewatching #2018
Sessions must apologize to Bernice King. CSK was a true patriot whose character Sessions can only aspire to.
As a defender of Justice, Sessions should apologize to @SenWarren on behalf of GOP for blatant sexism.
Senator Sessions should apologize to the Civil Rights activists he tried to silence.
@POTUS @SenatorSessions enjoy your remaining time, Bob. You'll be out on your ass next election. You and Lamar both. #RESIST
@POTUS @SenatorSessions MAGA
@POTUS @SenatorSessions  Proud to be working against your reelection and look forward to a Senator with strength of character.
Jeff Sessions is one of the Russian connections. He hates women, gays, blacks and others.
we will hold you accountable for the vote suppression to come
Your constituents loathe you. You have ignored our wishes and best interests at every turn. 2018 is coming!
Another proud racist!  Shame on you!  Enjoy your senate seat - while you still have the gig.
Like suppressing voting rights again! Way to go #Republicans We SO got this! #MAGA
trust and believe we will remember this awful decision. You support hate and racism
@POTUS @SpeakerRyan REALLY???  AND HOW WILL HE BE ACCESSIBLE WITHOUT A WORKING WH COMMENT LINE?? Republicans are out of touch!
Thank you, Senator Bob Corker !
@POTUS @SenatorSessions - you probably got paid a nice sum.
Yes, we can include your name under people to blame when the sheets hit the fan.  @SenBobCorker @POTUS @SenatorSessions
Sessions is a lunatic dominionist who the @ACLU will have to keep in check. Cut the glad-handing bullshit.
@POTUS @SenatorSessions by supporting Sessions, do mean you're holding the cross still while he sets it on fire?
Corker now you need to put self/special interest behind and support Trump in every aspect. Get to work
Your pride in Jeff Sessions is shared with David Duke and attack dog owners throughout Alabama
@POTUS @SenatorSessions Republicans do the right thing.. they will turn on you eventually. You know. Sad!
@POTUS @SenatorSessions boo
@POTUS @SenatorSessions racism is alive and wells amongst the GOP, never for the people all about money and power
@POTUS @SenatorSessions Proud to be a Trump lackey afraid to stand up for what is right. #historywillremember
@POTUS @SenatorSessions Bigot says what?
good man
Hopefully he won't let the FBI influence the next presidential election like the last one did.
@gracetobehuman @SenatorSessions  ty for your support!
Congrats! You're all doing an AWESOME JOB...thank you! †
@POTUS @SenatorSessions and I will be proud to vote for your opponent in 2018.
I'm very disappointed in your decision
@POTUS @SenatorSessions and that is end of my support for you Senator Corker
There will come a time in the next 4 yrs when you have to chose between the administration and the constitution.  Choose right
Disappointed!
Time to get to work on behalf of We The People. Things have changed, the usual doesn't cut it anymore.
Even prouder to NOT support @SenBobCorker in the next 2018 election cycle!
I think he could well Increase Racism if only by just standing by and doing nothing.
YEA! WOOHOO!
Law and order has returned to the USA!
This gives us a shovel ready job.. building more jails!
#PartyoverCountry
#MLK & #CorettaScottKing  R ROLLING OVER in their graves
A disgrace that Coretta Scott King's letter not allowed read into record by Senator Warren! @SenWarren
Hold him to this, Senator! 2018 coming up quickly! http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/31/sally-yates-responded-jeff-sessions-asked-would-defy-president/ … @POTUS @SenatorSessions

I'm a disappointed Tennessean who will not vote for you for any office you seek in the future.
How much did you receive in campaign contributions for this vote?
