This is inappropriate and irresponsible. Rex's track record proves that he's not in alignment with US therefore a bad choice.
What Rex did to nation of Chad in his Exxon deal should be extremely upsetting for anyone with basic compassion.
I enjoy talking about politics bc I think it's important we work together on problems that impact all of us.
But I think religious practices are very personal and not relevant.
Genuinely trying to understand the appeal of Rex to some and am interested in any articles/details to learn more.
I was CEO Cal Vet Board (Sac) NO board member would have ever treated another as @CoryBooker did Sen Sessions
I believe that.
admire how he refused to grovel in muck by name calling as @marcorubio demanded. 
NO way to begin negotiations
Marco is still wet behind the ears. and i dont seewhere Marco is fit 4 any Gov. job. Communist cuban
my sense is that you stand to financially gain from his appointment
yes, and I trust you will scoure thru Corker's possible conflicts of interest just as thoroughly, right?
your laziness and lack of principles are duly noted
Why?
We can't have Exxon in charge of the State Department....  #ExxonKnew  & is not concerned for our children's future.
sellout #irandeal
Bob Gives Tillerson Performance Enhancing Plug @HouseFloor @SenateFloor
Tex Tillerson looks like he stepped out the cast of "Giant".  An aged Rock Hudson and 100% all American.
of course. . Trump picked him...
When did you lose your spine and become such a hack. Sell America is what you have done.
you sold us out. To Russia. For oil money we haven't forgotten #russianhacking but it looks like you have.
You are a traitor to this great country. Serve the people, not your own greed.
no to tillerson
you are foolish
Why does he deny lobbying against sanctions?
@kldreams61 I Agree Mr Tillerson is an Excellent choice & along w/DT they will @MAGA but Mr Tillerson will Not be POTUS ..
Inspired indeed!
My sense is you're wrong.
Donald Trump does not pick losers!
@JoeyD11215 @marcorubio wanting him to aggressively condemn Russia & Saudi would make him as effective as Obama/Kerry
"rise to the occasion" - that is not how we pick SOS. Should be based on proven record and his is grim. Unbelievable.
Tillerson live and Alexander called him on it. Lying under oath is a felony.
You sir are delusional.
unfortunately 30 million Americans needed you to rise to the occasion for them last night and you did not. #ACA #Replacement
my take is being an outsider he will have an independent and fair view of world politics. Let America be great again
you can not be sure that he will rise to the occasion. He is in bed with the Russians. You have no guarantees. I don't trust
.@SenBobCorker "I wouldn't say that." 
Let's say Trump #MyPresident https://goo.gl/NFrIX7 
Is this the same sense that told you that VW didn't want unions in Chattanooga?
#thanks for being a #guardian for the people of #Tennessee and #America. #sarcasm
You will go down on the wrong side of history.   You had the chance to show your character, and you have. #midterms
Inspired by the Russian government, maybe.
If you support this inexperienced Tillerson with ties to Russia you are a traitor along with the rest of the Republicans
Mr. Corker, with all due respect - talking ain't listening and listening is learning......
What?!? I can't wait to learn about what it cost to buy your corruption
Well Crap.  My State Senator..the other one is already Paid for, Guess they raised the Ante...Christian Ethics down the drain.
He is against sanctions and will reverse what Obama put in place yet YOU support him? #traitor
As a voter you republicans need to start backing Trump or we start voting you out.
As a Tennessee voter, from YOUR DISTRICT, I am disgusted with your support of Tillerson.
"Whenever Tillerson seemed to make a misstep, there was Chairman Corker to keep things on course." http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/rex-tillerson-senate-hearing-233505 …
@transition2017 
@FergOSU Well done as Chairman today!
not if Rubio continues his nonsense
@claudianoreen
No double standard to be spotted here. 
#TrumpPressConference 
i disagree
I think  Bob Corker has aquitted himself very well at these hearings. Touché
@marcorubio @johnmccain2016 @LouDobbs @seanhannity Why hasn't anyone responded to the crap that the Dems are spitting all over themselves!
Most intelligent thing that has ever come out of your mouth.
he didn't know putin murdered people, doesn't believe in climate change action, claims he never spoke to trump abt anything!
do u think we believe he just HAPPENS to be tied to Russia?? Get rid of him or face the fact you're confirming a russian spy
@politicat1 oh please no Senator-sure he may have a good demeanor, but it has lead him to do evil with his power #ExxonKnew
@don47 Very impressed with Mr Tillerson & what he had to say re Russia. I thought he was relaxed,focused & prepared.
@SCroixFreePress 
U guys will approve him no matter what, let's not glorify/legitimize it.  At Exxon he was like cig company execs, power-liar.
Yes, Rex Tillerson is the right choice.
@Rosecake Senator Corker, agreed. We need to confirm this SOS.
What are you going to do to defend US security? Are you just a @realDonaldTrump rubber stamp? Lives could be at risk!
@rac80 - Your efforts during the hearing were admirable.
@LilyNCali So, @marcorubio will vote for him, saw he said no on @CNN
you "sense" he will "rise to the occasion"? Shouldn't Sec of State be an experienced diplomat / statesperson, ready to lead?
I oppose Tillerman for Secretary of State.  I hope you grow a spine don't let this man ruin us.
@SarahHuckabee I heard the exchange with Marco Rubio. I voted for Trump but I have concerns about Tillerson.
Please provide 3 reasons why Mr Tillerson is good choice for USA. As the Foreign Relatns Comm chair haven't you any concerns?
oh my god all you did today was think rex tillerson was fantastic for being sub par. he couldn't answer half the questions.
@TYT Hey if you thought Tillerson stamina impressive w/6 hours of confirmation hearing you must think Hillary to be superhero
ur sense is WRONG! We want energy independence & green energy! We don't want ppl compromised by Putin-war criminal #ExxonKnew
If he puts oil before the environment/citizens, we will remember your endorsement at the next election.
Listening to your summation here.Tillerson should have an opinion about war crimes. I'm a retired teacher and I do. Apologist.
Your remark to Tillerson: “You’ve shown extreme stamina for a 64-year-old male”.
Kiss ass much?
keep it up Senator!
.@SenBobCorker @Shelia_Kay Hey Bob next time can you keep your opening statement under 3 hours? Thanks, Everybody.
People hate what they see in themselves,, all the race card fools.
it is dangerous and irresponsible for you to back this man
This is not the way to drain the swamp. You are expanding the swamp and dumping radioactive substances into it.
Watched the hearing today and was very impressed. Possibly one of the best minds in the room!
@transition2017 Agreed! He is knocking it outta the park! Very impressive
@Angelfi81906197 excellent
Mr. Tillerson is demonstrating phenomenal wisdom and judgment and strength  USA will be well represented when he is confirmed
Mr. Tillerson personifies patriotism and leadership. @realDonaldTrump could not have chosen a better man for the job.
We desperately need a CEO of Rex Tillerson's caliber to drain the @StateDept swamp.
Maybe @SenBobCorker but being selected by donald for anything puts a target of doubt on one's back.
@oibc1988_n Impressed with insight, intelligence, love for America, clearly articulate, etc of cabinet members Trump selected
Impressive! Wow how could someone not see what a quality man he is?! Punk lil' Marco earned his title again today.
you garnered some sense?   Why isn't this headline news?
My sense is all you hacks in Congress are indebted to #BigOil for all the $$ they dump on you
SenBobCorker let me clear this up Interpret for you if I will. You would do the right thing? Right Tillerson?! #TheResistance
Anyone is better than hack politicians like John Kerry and Hilary Clinton. @SenBobCorker @MyPresidentme
I think he's a really great choice!
@transition2017 #MAGA
@SpecialKMB1969 attacks on Tillerson today than Sessions yesterday is shameful & very disturbing !!!
It is OK. They get the opportunity to show the world that they are excellent nominees. #Tillerson #Sessions
.@SenBobCorker @SpecialKMB1969 America is fortunate to have a SecState nominee of Tillerson's level willing to serve. Very impressive.
@Peggy7172 Not so sure about him after his climate change response
watchimg intently, he's remarkable his demeanor  ( brilliant choice )
@transition2017 :
It looks more of hit job on Tillerson than anything else.
@transition2017 yes!
@transition2017 I watched these hearings today and Tillerson is a deliberate, intelligent & thoughtful man. Perfect choice.
Sen. Rubio was out of line expecting a definitive condemning of Putin, Philippines & Saudi's from Tillerson, put in bad light
@WheredidMaGo Amen
Glad you're mind's made up. My sense is he & Donald are inadequately prepared & w/o tax returns, both undeserving of our trust
Dude oozes power
I'm watching the confirmation hearings and he is doing well
@JrcheneyJohn 
At least one makes sense.
@marcorubio @SenRubioPress It is abundantly clear that in addition to conflicts #RexTillerson is unqualified to be Sec. of St.
@transition2017,  more #librials #democrats still crying, and will cost them seats in the #midterms
@transition2017 Rex Tillerson is going to be awesome! #MAGA
Come on. Are you kidding me? His answers today vary from uninformed to obstructionist to just wrong. Please say NO.
#POTUS #WeThePeople #DrainTheSwamp #LockHerUp #CommanderInChief #Flamingos4Trump #Breaking
@transition2017 my sense is that he's Putin's pal #resist
you were masterful today during the segment I saw. Thank you from a regular American. @transition2017
I voted for @marcorubio too. He is such a disappointment. He is acting like a petulant child.
@transition2017 I think he is a great choice. Americans want change. Get rid of status quo politicians!
@transition2017 Tillerson is over qualified for SOS 
When I heard Planned Parenthood expressed alarm about his possible appointment, I immediately liked him.
@transition2017 SENATOR former the PORKER did u get Iran deal signed yet bimbo your a fraudster AKA classic POLITICIAN
I agree. He's smart and stays above provocative politically motivated comments at the Sen. hearing.
Amazing the number of Socialist/Communist tweeters we have responding on here.
@transition2017 There are too many questions abt his opinion of Trump! Stupid! So political!
@transition2017 @mitchellvii @IngrahamAngle @TuckerCarlson @TheFive Embarrassed 2 have ties to NJ. Speaks are agenda driv&rude
@transition2017 So true, amazing exchange he is a leader not a hack politician
@transition2017 no truer words spoken
@transition2017
@transition2017 wth is the corrupt Menendez on this committee? POS from NJ 
As for Rubio..badgering Tillerson...Rubio is in over his head...Tillerson head and shoulders above Rubio re: experience,smarts
@transition2017 Brilliant choice!
Too bad we can't trust your sense.
I bet you and @jeffsessions believe that Dylann Roof didn't have a fair hearing either! #racismmustfall #NeverSessions
Tillerson very smart man with vast knowledge of the world and dealing with world leader's. A real asset to Trump Cabinet. ^5
@transition2017 of course! The greedy &/or corrupt believe N the greedy &/or corrupt it only makes sense.
yes!
@transition2017 Will he proudly display his award from Putin in his WH office?
@transition2017. To all the Trump haters. Get your tissues ready for the next 8 years.
@transition2017 Great answer from Tillerson regarding human rights issues in Saudi Arabia.
@transition2017 Tillerson just owned Marco lmao
When? When Tillie refused to acknowledge human rights abuses?
I'm no fan of Rubio - but still.
@transition2017 So you think he'll be better than Hillary? HAHAHA just kidding 
thank you for putting a stop to Sen Cardin's attempt to intimidate Sec of State Nominee Tillerson with tax return questions.
Did I miss something, when did Rubio change teams?
@marcorubio is the only one that did his job. Once again you embarrass Tennessee!
Be a grownup in the room--you know this is a dangerous risk to our country. Take your party back.
So you side with Russia? You will sell America for Party? you are a disgrace! #Treason! @Tennessean
Terrible optics of good 'ol boys club.  Your goal of appearing consistent in vetting Tillerson vs others: FAIL.
wrong
thank you sir for clearing views @RexTillersonHQ biopartizsn is key to success against #irandeal Bashar & Puttin.
I called your office & I'll call again. Tillerson & Trump r in bed with Russia, & u know it. History will not be kind.
He is NOT your average Secretary of State nominee. Has close ties to an enemy of our country. Awarded as their friend
Tillerman needs to Show them his Taxes to ensure he has NO Russian Ties or financial conflicts NOW
Shame on you
yes we c how your doing everything you can to convince the committee.  your wasting time on viewpoint #CongressionalHearings
You sir are either in this man's pocketbook or just a dishonest Trump flunky who lost your ethics big league! So unfair!

Watching you play verbal defense for #Tillerson is exactly what's wrong with you REDS
how can you make a statement before the hearings are over? Biased are we?
really? That's embarrassing!
BOTH
Do you support America or Russia! #noTillerson
how is he possibly a good choice? Explain ties to Russia?
I have serious doubts that Tillerson will rise to the job. It will be dangerous when/if your sense is proved wrong.
.  Russia is our enemy and they have compromised PEOTUS who nominated Tillerson, Russia's best friend. Whose side are you on?
#fakenews
Bobby,your latest buzz word is "inspired".
Your sense? Really? My sense tells me he's sympathetic towards Putin
Donald Trump/Communist Russia have compromised our Democracy. Tillerson is their man. Not suitable in light of DJT treason.
Oh yea, a billionaire oilman with zero experience...perfect!
Save medicare, replace before repeal!
his answer about sanctions was disturbing, no confirming!
sorry Bob, no amount of spin can make this smell right.  He is a tool of the Russians
Sen, with all due respect, you are just repeating platitudes.  Have you been listening to his answers this morning?
Wrong! @marcorubio stood up for America. You're an embarrassing sellout. Rex couldn't even answer ?'s correctly w/o your help.
Will Russian troops be bivouacked in your back yard @SenBobCorker?
wake up!! No he will not.
Another Fortune Tellers Prediction...
.@SenBobCorker 
Bob Corker 2014: Russian aggression is bad and I am introducing a Russian sanctions bill

Bob Corker 2017: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I just wonder, inspired for whom? Like you Bob , he is part of America's super elite. He does have a past history to draw on.
He seems badly misinformed about Putin's murders of opponents and about Exxon's role in promoting climate denial.
and it's lobbying to undermineding American laws that punished Russia.
Russian ties will be extremely problematic. No diplomatic experience.
My sense is that the whole lot of you are rotten to the core.
@marcorubio Tell Little Marco to shut up and he is an embarrassment #Tillerson
Prefer someone with government and/or diplomatic experience. Too closely aligned with Putin.
They matter now. #Truth
You don't?
