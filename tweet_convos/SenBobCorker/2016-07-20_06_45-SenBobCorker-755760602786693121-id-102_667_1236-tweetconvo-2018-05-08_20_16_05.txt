@MsRoseHypnol @Nigel_Farage Thank you Senator
God was.. not critical...
Did you happen to ask him why he lied to the people about using the savings for national health service!
ok first off Nigel was asked the day after Brexit on tv about it and said none will go to NHS
#Brexit process has nothing to do with @Nigel_Farage, he's not in the UK government and never has been
The process of making Brexit happen will be done by government ministers, not the pub bore. @SenBobCorker @Nigel_Farage
I could say exactly the same thing. Now go away and stop behaving like a childish troll. @SenBobCorker @Nigel_Farage
you do know Farage has all the influence in #Brexit negotiations as I do. Don't waste your time.
NIGEL FARAGE HAS MORE GUTS THAN THE WHOLE OF THE CONS & LIEBOR PARTIES PUT TOGETHER. HE WORKS FOR THE PEOPLE.
.@SenBobCorker Hey Bob! Just wondered why you were wasting your time meeting @Nigel_Farage? He’s got nothing to do with anything. Cheers!
Single-handedly? You’re deluded.
@alllibertynews @Nigel_Farage do u have any idea what u are taking about? What happened to the Republican party of my youth?

The anti union guy who put VW off Tenessee. Well done you. 'cos people organising isn't a free market' doh.
great meeting glad we were able to make it work
represents extreme right wing he's rude & a bigot.
- of course!  Now you support Brit-Trump too!!
Nigel Farage has a semi-detached relationship with just ONE UK Member of Parliament !!!!
what about #EUexitAfrica #UKexitNigeria #Ngrexit Double standards is tantamount to World disorder & hypocrisy
Farage is a patsy and a puppet

Well senator, you will be surprised in 2-5 years how strong a EU with Brexit will be...
two idiots in a picture
@Juliet777777 @Varneyco Nigel_Farage @BorisJohnson AMERICANS LOVE THESE BRITS. Gods Messengers ofPeace. @LouDobbs @trish_regan
@Juliet777777 @Nigel_Farage Thank You Boris & Nigel, Baby! YOU DID IT, NOW WE MUST DO IT. God CertainlyWorks inMYSTERIOUS ways
OMG r u listening to this man with no real honour like a captain that leaves his ship, Desperate times
Good to see you making big strides stateside
but not the Baltic NATO allies? Right? Russians can just walk in there according to your nominee
We hope Brits exit the EU and do many wonderful deals.
keep working Nigel  the holiday can wait
why support @Nigel_Farage if he's being so critical?
"history is sitting next to you senator who dares wins true Brit grit is Nigel have nice day"!
thanks bob
nigal farage is the main man 
What? Farage caused chaos here, had no plan for Brexit & has now run away.
nothing like a photo of Nigel Farage to stir people's emotions 
I think I'm liking Senator Bob.
he's a great man and people should be thankful he help to get us out
Shame on @Nigel_Farage that he doesn't stop drawing an MEP's salary and get a proper job #brexitjustice
Somebody having a good time after all the dramas.
given his pride in talking Truth to Power, & disdain 4 migrants,hope he will remind US is a mix of EU migrants
congratulations Senator on getting to meet the great man
They lied people wanted immigration sorted they never said it would take two years and free movement continues
So you want a recession. Yeah good job.
Teresa May to undo 30 years of UKIP Damage to Brit-In.
What sort of things came out of the meeting?
@UKIP_Bury @Nigel_Farage what does he actually do now?? Thought the rat left the ship?
=WHAT 'MOVE'?
you know he's a jizz gargling tit crumpet don't you?
fucking take the lying traitor I hope we close our borders whilst you have him over there
@louisrossilevy Great Britain has no greater friend than the US
On behalf of the British people, I offer my sincere condolences on your having to spend time with this buffoon.
You do not speak for me.
Nige doesn't speak for me either, but insists on saying 'The British People' voted Brexit. Not me.
Fair enough. He speaks for the majority of voters though
Indeed. If he could restrict himself to saying that, I'd likely stop whinging (well, not totally).
there would have been no #EURef & subsequently no #Brexit without @Nigel_Farage
...because Farage's UK role is... er... what exactly?
No need to support NF, he doesn't speak for the UK. #fartandlefttheroom
These men love their country, unlike the traitor we have in office and the traitor to be that's the DEM nominee
- This is brilliant!
Thanks. X
@RaheemKassam @Nigel_Farage Nigel is a great ambassador to this country and carries weight having delivered Brexit.
he is a nobody
Thx for the support but what has Farage got to do with it? He doesn't speak for Britain; indeed he just ran away
@Arron_banks @Nigel_Farage apart from sending us down that disastrous path, farage has nothing to do with how we go down it
@p_edmond @geoffdinneen Demonstrating our US politicians have no clue about politics in other countries
.@SenBobCorker I cannot believe you met w/ that clown, @Nigel_Farage.  http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/20/nigel-farage-barack-obama-brexit-london-republican-convention?CMP=share_btn_tw …
Sen Corker  Please keep Nigel there.  He can be Trump's friend.
@LeaveEUOfficial @Nigel_Farage Why would you think talking to Farage is supporting the UK? He's irrelevant.
Senator, with you chairing the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, your view carries considerable weight.
@Arron_banks @Nigel_Farage you are aware that this man is a quasi racist liar with no political position or power in the UK?
@RaheemKassam @Nigel_Farage i hope bob corker decides to leave the USA and move to the EU. He has the same dumb ideas

good work Nigel, taking the initiative as usual! Keep up the good work #NoRegrets
He does NOT represent the UK. @Nigel_Farage
About 52% ;)
He holds no official position & please don't suggest all of the52% are stupid enough to follow him.
48% of people were stupid enough to want to stay with a completely bonkers union not knowing what..
Thanks for your support. If other countries ever end up running your country, we'll be sure to help you out @Nigel_Farage
Indeed. Better Off Out. Brexit.
Heard the saying you can tell a lot about a man by the company he keeps Bob.
you do realise that d..k has resigned and done a runner (not that he had any power)
Our Nigel will still be a busy chap.
I'll take "photos Bob will want scrubbed in two years" for $200.
Soon Britain and US to return to good times!
Listen to this clever little Englishman. He just sorted my country out and he can help yours too, bigtime.
@Starr_Anise
Farage is not an MP ... pointless exercise. .. fail.
OfficialHCEC is pleased to update with both of you, to have a very good meeting is Reality having great things .
Stop giving this populist wrecker air-time.
"Dumb and Dumber Too"

#RNCinCLE #RNC2016
Bob get Nigel a pint:)
a pint ! A few more like it
Good to see it's not just UK politicians that waste a lot of time.
do you have so much time to waste?
not sure what he told you but it's got nothing to do with him now
nigel bailed tho
Oh, so you remainers do concede that the european parliament is powerless? Good to know.
And how much legislation from the EU ends up being implemented in the UK? Hmm?
about 9 million percent according to Farage
