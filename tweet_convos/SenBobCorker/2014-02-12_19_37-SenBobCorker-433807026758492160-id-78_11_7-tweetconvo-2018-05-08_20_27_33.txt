@SenBobCorker your statements on this issue are misleading and represent an obvious character flaw within you Senator.
@Mallen1011A @SenBobCorker Bob Corker is a Koch bros. whore
@SenBobCorker is Grover Norquist and the Koch brothers making a huge contribution to your campaign fund because of your activism?
@Mallen1011A @SenBobCorker you got it, he cares nothing about his constituents, only the money flowing to his wallet.
@Melmar11 @SenBobCorker agree 100%!  That's why he flip- flopped on his original neutrality.  $$ talks.
@Mallen1011A @DEANRICHARDS9 @Melmar11 @SenBobCorker what is corker's next move... restore slavery?
@stphil @DEANRICHARDS9 @Melmar11 @SenBobCorker I'm sure he believes workers should be slaves to corporations.
@SenBobCorker Fired this senile Senator,  he is not working for TN, but for the KOCH brothers
@SenBobCorker Why are you threatening the betterment of all those auto workers? A senator promoting low wage & benefits, seriously?
@SenBobCorker This guy is TRASH, not allowing worker and the auto plant to decide what they want.  Corker is the slum of TN
@SenBobCorker A vote by ignorant people who essentially vote against theirselves. Tenn. is cowardly
@SenBobCorker u lying sack of flaming dog shit!
@SenBobCorker you shame the U.S. senate.
@Melmar11 @DEANRICHARDS9 Union voting is a Democratic right. He should butt out. Period. Threats and intimidation are unacceptable.
.@SenBobCorker @jarrodmyrick Eat shit, fucklord
@SenBobCorker Glad to see someone standing up for freedom and liberty. Oops, that's ony meant for corporations in your mind, I see.
@SenBobCorker Volks plant can retool anywhere Unions unite !!!
.@SenBobCorker is the Chris Christie of Tennessee. Not only is he a liar, he may have broken federal law. #UAWVW
.@SenBobCorker u r wrong on #VW, wrong on the @UAW and wrong on the law. Workers won't fall for your tricks. #UAWVW
@hanson_alan @SenBobCorker @UAW there is a GM plant in TN right ? My brother in law works there in Spring Hill = UNION !!!!!
@laurieblond6 there is and they've been ADDING good jobs to Tennessee. @SenBobCorker @UAW
@SenBobCorker , the TRASH of the Republicans.  Injecting his fear into the auto workers.
@SenBobCorker Even though Volkswagon has already said that the vote makes no difference on its plans.
@SenBobCorker EVEN Volkswagen says this is complete BS! Why would you try to mislead auto workers like this? Are you a "KOCHSUCKER"? #WTFGOP
@SenBobCorker hope u go to federal person for breaking federal labor law. Good luck being a lousy politician and person
@SenBobCorker What happened to big govt staying out of business picking winner/loser? Lies from the pit of hell. #specialplaceinhellforyou
@SenBobCorker So where is it? Did you lie? Yes, you did lie.
@SenBobCorker one thing we really don't need are more #SUV on road & another is government employees like you!
@SenBobCorker Now we will actually get to see if this was a SHAMELESS LIE or if u were telling the truth!!
@SenBobCorker That's not what Volkswagen said.
@SenBobCorker Should IMPEACH U "TAXATION" W/O Representation? U R a "gerrymandered "4 LIFE" Senator from HELL, SOB!!
@SenBobCorker YOU are LYING, even plant manager says so. WHY DO YOU HATE AMERICAN WORKERS?
@SenBobCorker - Why do u hate Tennessee workers and love government interference? Happy f'n Valentines day #UAWVW #1u
@SenBobCorker WHY do you HATE Workers? Union members make more $$$ and have better Benefits.
@SenBobCorker Sen Cracker is nothing but union busting scum!
@SenBobCorker The lies didn't work for Romney and they won't work for you. Shame!
@SenBobCorker lies, lies, lies.  Things like will stand against debt limit increase, ooops, did I just vote to increase debt limit again?
@SenBobCorker you seem to have a issue with the truth. I hope the people of Tennessee vote you out of office.
@SenBobCorker #slave You want American workers 2 b low wage slaves?  We r going to make GOP & Koch types wash our dirty rest rooms U Corp Ho
@SenBobCorker this seems like a scumbag move. Did I misinterpret? U took side vs the little guy, right?
Amazing! @SenBobCorker would rather have his constituents lose their jobs than have union jobs - even though @VW supports unionization
@SenBobCorker hmmm, Volkswagen said this is not true. Are you always such a liar? #UAW #unions
@SenBobCorker conversations with whom? #chatt #uawvw
@SenBobCorker The Big Lie isn't enough for you so you break federal law too. Do I hear recall?
@SenBobCorker Thought you believed govt should stay out of the private sector, except when govt wants to stop unions and keep lower wages.
.@SenBobCorker you're a fucking idiot. A vote AGAINST workers will improve production? What planet do you live in and logic do you employ?!
. @SenBobCorker @MikeElk uh, we have labor laws that make that kind of co. threat illegal. Given their neutrality, doubt VW made it.
@SenBobCorker it's already been proven you are lying. Only a #Sociopath can do what you r, & pretend you haven't disgraced r country & self.
@SenBobCorker uh, no.  Debunked on PBS story
@SenBobCorker I thought GOP believes in staying out of private business , leave VW alone none of govt business
@SenBobCorker conversations today indicate corporate donors run your twitter feed @UAW
@SenBobCorker You are lying to your constituents, hardworking people trying to support their families for political gain. Shame on you!
@SenBobCorker you are an outrageous liar! You are all about free market till workers want a Union. You are crazy out of line!
@SenBobCorker You R lying! Neither local VW nor corporate in Germany have said that. Corker will force the SUV ops to Lansing. #TNpol #gapol
Shameless liar “@SenBobCorker: Corker: Conversations Today Indicate a Vote Against UAW is a Vote for SUV Production http://1.usa.gov/1fifyUc ”
@JesseLaGreca @BlueDuPage @SenBobCorker LIAR CORKER! Stick with your first statement and STAY OUT!
@SenBobCorker Without unions the US would not have a strong middleclass. As unions diminish, so goes the middleclass under REPUB governments
I wish @SenBobCorker, rabid "keep govt out of business" could explain why he a #government official is meddling in affairs of a pvt business
@SenBobCorker I understand VW has a good relationship with its labor groups like unions in Germany, why are you prohibiting that to occur?
@SenBobCorker You and your ilk have kept the thumb on workers for too long!
@SenBobCorker Senator, do you hate the middle class so much to stop VW from growing in your state when VW is fine with unions?
@SenBobCorker unbelievable! your interference is shocking! so much for "freedoms" under capitalism
@SenBobCorker I used to semi admire you, but interfering in the 'V W plant is disgusting.
@SenBobCorker Blatantly illegal statement.
@SenBobCorker The Tennessee Titans are unionized. How long before you withdraw tax incentives and send the team to Mexico?
@SenBobCorker Senator you've heard of Twitter, Facebook, cellphones, right? We know. U R being dishonest about UAW. VW isn't against it. U R
@SenBobCorker Simply put: That's a lie and you are a liar!
@SenBobCorker shameless
@SenBobCorker I've got a joke for you. How can you tell if a politician is lying?

His lips are moving! #lyingsackofshit
@SenBobCorker and when you say VW do you mean the Koch brothers?
@SenBobCorker a shame #VW unequivocally denied ever making such a statement.
@hanson_alan @SenBobCorker Its simple... VW has proven that Bob Corker the Racist is a Bold Faced Liar... Bob Corker =  Liar #MSNBC @Maddow
@SenBobCorker vote against UAW is vote for SUV production IN MEXICO!
@SenBobCorker READ HERE HOW SEN CORKER IS AGAINST THE WORKING CLASS & UNIONS
 http://m.dailykos.com/story/2014/02/13/1277294/-Corker-threatens-jobs-if-Volkswagen-workers-unionize …
@SenBobCorker should be ashamed of yourself! YOU are a public official, UAW represents the WORKERS! Your actions are pathetic! SHAME ON YOU
@SenBobCorker So saying VW may not get tax incentives & No Vote gets them product.Shame on you for intimidating  the bluecollar workers
@SenBobCorker what is your motive?
.@SenBobCorker stay the fuck out of it. Not your business or concern. #union #UAWVW #P2 #UNITEBLUE
@SenBobCorker From conversations with friends that work at VW there will be a union there.At least VW has remained neutral.
@SenBobCorker VW can move to Texas.
@stevekr49 @SenBobCorker there u go. The answer is always move to Texas.the land of cheap labor & witless scabs.#texascapitalism
