I am running for senator against Mr Corker , to get all of the failed policies through and vote against democrats taxes
Don't forget to thank POTUS for bringing jobs back to Tennessee!!
Who do you think brought them to you. Buy opening the TAX breaks for companies. DA. Wow you better leave DC. What a shame.
have you paid your taxes yet, Crooked Bob? Or are those just for little people?
I'm starting to like you a little better.
It is Trump that made the business environment better that is creating jobs. Corker is a Trump obstructionist.
Want good news? We'll be working with @realDonaldTrump  and real Republicans to unseat RINOs like @SenBobCorker & @SenateMajLdr Mitch M.

I don't know when your seat is up BUT we will do our Best to make sure you don't win again! You're done! Have you APOLOGIZED to POTUS??
2018...He's in trouble and he's getting a primary.
. Right and Thank Mr. Trump.  Mr. Corner you and Republicans need to work with Mr. Trump. I'm a Tennessean and unhappy
Your disgusting to Tennesseans
Do you even grammar?
I don't think that I can ever support you again because of your comments about Trump
Bob pay ur taxes ! Sharpton n Corker birds of a feather flock together n politician who makes sure he is raking in millions for his pocket
How did that happen?
You refuse to honor our president, take undeserved cedit for Trump's influence on the economy,  you think your getting reelected? HELL NO!
You can thank @POTUS for that. Memphis is putting you under a microscope now.
Be careful.   Trump will say it was him.
We should give President Trump credit for getting these new jobs in Tennessee.
congress approval rating: 10%; media approval rating lower than the POTUS'.

HMMMM....Wonder how this happened!  Must be that "UNSTABLE" Trump again.
Who is the greatest asset person in the GOP? It is Trump. You Corker are insignificant. Work with Trump or get voted out in 2018.
You are taking credit for jobs Trump help create? You best start working with Trump else it's defeat in 2018 for you. Just tell Soros, NO!
He rewards her with a top government position.

Apologize to @realDonaldTrump and support his agenda or you'll be out soon. Tennessee voter.
Get behind Trump or get gone. America voted for him, not you.
Did you do this all on your own SENATOR CORKER??
Your political career is over. Watch. #TrumpTrainRolling
Swamp
Senator if you can't get behind our #POTUS that you was elected by the people to do then put a Cork in it!!!

Trump sends out bulldog Huckabee-Sanders to attack you. This whole admin is unhinged
Your comment on President Trump to CNN was beyond the pale.
Years ago, I used to watch you on C-SPAN and think what a fair representative you were. FINALLY, starting to see some of that again. 
T. Y.
Resign Corker.
Thank @realDonaldTrump
That's great. Now go back to DC and work on repealing O'care, the wall built, taxes lowered, military stronger, and keeping our history.
Are you going to ban Transgender employees, like you are allowing Trump to do in the military, w/o any objections?????????
Takes courage to be anywhere with @MarshaBlackburn....
Beware TN, #BobCorker is a snake in the grass! A #SuperRhino - check out his filibuster vote against @tedcruz which help the @DNC fund #BHOC
Are you going to detract (take back) #nasty things you said about @realDonaldTrump???  You lost over half of #TN voters with that dumb move.
He list mine asking time ago he's like a fungus that won't go away!!
Wonderful! 
Now what are you doing to help expedite Donorrhea's departure from the White House?
BOT BOT BOT
NO GOOD ever comes from going on CNN, MSNBS or others for interviews!! You prove yourself a TRAITOR to @realDonaldTrump and VOTERS!
"You prove yourself a TRAITOR to @realDonaldTrump and VOTERS!"
You've started this whole mess of MEDIA attacking @realDonaldTrump stability to be POTUS! Your name brought up as "his own party" said it.
WE cannot believe you would say @realDonaldTrump  isn't competent or fit to be President! NOW CNN runs story daily; ON right now!
Maybe someone.made a deposit in his account at Bank of the Swamp
Why any GOP member at DC would say this to a LEFTY TV Program or Paper is BEYOND ME!

Corker will be held responsible!
So the factory will be full of workers when IRAN DROPS THE NUKE!
We use to like you as a Senator. NOW we can't stand you! CNN & MSNBS keep the story going of what you said about @realDonaldTrump  SICKENING
Great Job Senator Corker.  Thanks for serving your constituents well
