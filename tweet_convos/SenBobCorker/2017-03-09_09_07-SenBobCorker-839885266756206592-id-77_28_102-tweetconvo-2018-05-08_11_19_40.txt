You should be discussing Russia and Sessions lying also!
Please make it clear budget impact of tax cuts required before vote on AHCA

@The budget isn't the problem   It is a solution if created properly!
EPA & EDU are also critical for US health + prosperity. Plz have some perspective.
Why the "X" on your hand?
how about you stand up for your country first instead of being proud to meet the Russian Puppet!
Remember, clean air and water more important than money. @repjimcooper
you chair the foreign relations committee- why not investigate Trump-Russia relations?
oh gawd- can't fathom the enlightenment you'll gain there. SPECIAL PROS;SaveACA; IMPEACH TRUMP
Express my displeasure with the AHCA. Exactly the opposite that was promised.
As a TN voter, I hope we can count on you to stop @SpeakerRyan from destroying lives w/his "plan." @FOXNashville @WhiteHouse
You have some high hopes. I however think he will place party before people.
You two should get along well. You are both selfish, caring nothing for your constituents.
Tennesseans don't want a wall! We need #ACA tweaked not slashed! Be a leader not a follower.
Corker, time to represent Tennesseans! AHCA will cost more and benefit ONLY insurance companies.
@ShaneGoldmacher @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse   Be sure to discuss how much the grifter's costing taxpayers w NY apt security
well interesting! steal from one dept.to cause deconstruction... Mr. Corker aka Mr. Follow Leader
looking forward to voting against you again. Can't wait for a townhall corksoaker
TrumpCare just passed 2 House committees. You must stop this! Please speak up for Tennesseans!

@SamanthaWZTV @realDonaldTrump  how about you dicuss @COSProject instead. 225 years of Representative govt hasn't worked.
Why do you continue to pretend Trump is a legitimate POTUS?
tell him to stop going to Florida every weekend to play golf at tax payers expense
Trump is a pathological liar and doesn't understand government. You won't have a productive meeting.
What to cut to pay for that wall? I don't think Mexico is paying for it.

- it is past time for you to stand up and do what's right for Tennesseeans and all Americans. #ThursdayThoughts #resist
How about proposing a balanced one for a change!
As a constituent, I respectfully ask you to ask him about a real health care plan
@ShaneGoldmacher @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse How about discussing the traitors resignation? Or are you a traitor as well
you need to discuss the tennesseans that will lose health insurance if his healthcare bill passes
Oppose #trumpcare. Protect your constituents, and the poor/sick/elderly through the country

.@realDonaldTrump cutting $43M from Coast Guard drug interdiction as he drops > $50M in 122 days on vacays & Melania's separate residence. 
Congress needs to envoke Sec 4/25th A...he is a danger to our country & unfit to serve. Period!
But in all seriousness. Thank you for fighting for those trapped in modern slavery. It’s an evil that needs to be destroyed.
