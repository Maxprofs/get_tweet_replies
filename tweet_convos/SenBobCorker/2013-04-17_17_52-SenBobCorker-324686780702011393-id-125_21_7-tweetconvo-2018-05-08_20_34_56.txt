@SenBobCorker shame on you. You're such a sensible man and this explanation is so weak, it looks like you've sold out to the NRA for $/votes
@SenBobCorker shame on you.
@anthonyhollock @senbobcorker Dude, do you even live in Tennessee?
@KevinDWhiteTN times and technology have changed, and so should our laws to accommodate to them: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LORVfnFtcH0&feature=player_embedded …
@SenBobCorker How can BG checks be overly burdensome when already in place for gun dealers?  Your statement reeks of "controlled by the NRA"
@SenBobCorker Shame on you for supporting lobbyists rather than listening to and protecting your constituents.
@SenBobCorker SHAME ON YOU !
@SenBobCorker no guts. shameful.
@SenBobCorker My 80 year old republican grandmother AND NRA member father both plan to unburden you come reelection. #votegunsense now!
@SenBobCorker Where was Obama from '08-'12 when thousands were killed by illegal handguns in his own Chicago.
@SenBobCorker if 20 dead 6 year olds doesn't make you do the right thing, then I have no use for you. SHAME ON YOU.
@SenBobCorker so u don't care abt all the shootings in Chattanooga your hometown?! Of all people should YOU be helping Manchin & Toomey!
@SenBobCorker You know what else is a burden? Being told your child has been killed. Terribly burdensome.
@SenBobCorker Again, thanks for supporting the majority of Tennesseans
@SenBobCorker Bad for the people of Tennessee. A small price to pay for a good NRA rating (and money) though...
@SenBobCorker  Requiring me to show that I am not a criminal nor mentally impaired before I can buy a gun is not unconstitutional.Shame!
@SenBobCorker What about the certainlty of death for 30,000 Americans every year? Just be honest-you love the NRA lining your pocket!
@SenBobCorker thank you for your vote on this
@SenBobCorker Shame on you sir, you have misrepresented 90% of the country by refusing to support this issue.
@SenBobCorker Senator Corker, I applaud you on your efforts and promises. Please do not allow the president to go around you.
@SenBobCorker shame on you #coward
@SenBobCorker Thank you for your strength and courage. The GOP is stronger because of you. This bill wouldn't have saved 1 life.
@SenBobCorker you have failed your people and the great state of MS.
@SenBobCorker your "defense" of your vote on gun control is embarrassing. It's not "burdensome", it's common sense.  Try reading the bill.
@SenBobCorker you made the wrong choice.
.@SenBobCorker Please explain yourself to mothers of dead children, you soulless piece of subhuman shit.
/@SenBobCorker Hey dumb fuck- you just voted to continue losing 1000s of lives/year to #gun violence. You're a killer w blood on your hands.
@SenBobCorker you listened to the majority in TN and voted to Protect the 2nd Amendment, I'm glad you didnt fall for the false "90%" claim.
@SenBobCorker so much crap-you voted against wishes of Americans and made a sham of our system -hope the gun lobby rewards you well shame
@SenBobCorker listen to your constituents not the NRA.
@SenBobCorker Your vote is disgraceful. Think of the "burdens" the family of a gun violence victim faces.
@SenBobCorker 94% of American want more strict gun laws!
@SenBobCorker Your vote greatly appreciated.
@SenBobCorker You are a disgrace.
@SenBobCorker It's about time one of our senators stood up for us and sucked the gun lobby's butthole and let them jizz on your face.
@SenBobCorker thank god you saved those burdens from happening! Much preferable to preventing tragedy!
@SenBobCorker I wish those tweeters from the north would stay home they do not represent TN
@SenBobCorker thank you for your No vote, we love you here in the Great State of TN
@SenBobCorker so unbelievably disappointed in you and my home state. My husband and I will think twice before voting for you again.
@SenBobCorker I have followed your antics since you tried to take GM pensions away..I can be sure now that you are the snake I thought
@SenBobCorker shame on you
@SenBobCorker Thank you for using facts over emotions with your #guncontrol vote and for protecting our Constitution #2a
@SenBobCorker Shame on you!  You're a low life coward, a hypocrite, a partisan politician.  You must be on the NRA payroll.  Disgusting!
@SenBobCorker It is too easy for criminals to get guns. http://nyti.ms/17215tM   You voted against the American people. #demandaplan
@SenBobCorker <-- Big #FAIL
@SenBobCorker Did you sleep soundly last night knowing you made life easier for gun buyers? How did the parents of Newtown sleep last nite?
@SenBobCorker - You are a coward. Shame! Enjoy your NRA blood $.
@SenBobCorker I'll go with "burdensome" over dead children, thanks for ignoring the public will.
@SenBobCorker Coward shame on you
@SenBobCorker  A shameful day for Washington, and for you,  personally. Guess you can comfort future gun victims with your NRA rating.
@SenBobCorker 
Disgraceful. Cowering to special interests. The senate has reached a new low. Sickening and a national embarrassment
@SenBobCorker #ShameOnYou you gotta take the NRA outta your mouth if you want us to understand you.
@SenBobCorker You chose #GunsOverPeople for #NRAbloodmoney. Shame on you Sir, your a coward. #NewtownBetrayed #Gabby #GunControlSavesLives.
@SenBobCorker Yes, because I'm sure victims & families of preventable gun violence have no burdens & uncertainty. Good job, jerk.
@SenBobCorker The law actually said the opposite of what you just said. You are actually an idiot, and do not deserve this responsibility.
@SenBobCorker the next time a mentally ill person opens fire, how will you answer to your vote today?
@SenBobCorker I'm thankful you do not represent me. Nor do you represent 90% of Americans. disgraceful.
@SenBobCorker Why wouldn't a gun owner agree to any hoops to get a gun if it saved even one life of a child? Where are your priorities? Sick
@SenBobCorker I hope u have a family member murdered by an ex-con who purchases a weapon online.  Burn in hell!!!
@SenBobCorker Thank you sir! A REAL American!
@SenBobCorker #NRA increased $$$ to @GOP after #SandyHook. How much per child did you get? We will remember. #stoprush #demandAction #p2
@SenBobCorker Sen. say they're afraid of NRA. Your fear worth more than terror of mass-murdered 1st graders? Coward 4 hire. #DemandAction
I pray for your soul @SenBobCorker for putting politics & NRA money above the lives of children. You enable crime & violence.We won't forget
@SenBobCorker 93% of gun households, 89% of Republicans & 85% of NRA member households support universal background checks. #badatyourjob
@SenBobCorker COWARD
@SenBobCorker Seriously? Did you even read it? It does not impede the 2nd amendment rights of individuals. Shame on you.
@SenBobCorker Shame. #guncontrolvotes
@SenBobCorker You have lost my vote next time.
@SenBobCorker You have failed us.  Shame on you.
@SenBobCorker Tell the parents of the children massacred @ Newtown about "burdensome".  Shame on you!!
@SenBobCorker thank you for helping to uphold the 2nd amendment right for me and my family. I deeply appreciate it. Thank you
Bullshit. Coward. “@SenBobCorker: Sen. Corker opposed Toomey-Manchin saying it was overly burdensome & creates uncertainty.”
@SenBobCorker Coward.! And how would you have voted if one of your children or grandchildren was killed in the Connecticut massacre?
@joeltalks Wrong cowards are those who fell for the demogoguery and went with the crowd and rushed do-nothing legislation. @SenBobCorker
@SenBobCorker You are a disgrace to the nation -- a shameful and cowardly public servant.
@SenBobCorker Dead children don't vote. Nor contribute to campaigns. But I'm curious: Did it EVER occur to you to do the right thing today?
Shame on you @SenBobCorker
@SenBobCorker You knew right thing to do but lacked the courage of conviction. You should be ashamed of what you did.
@SenBobCorker You are a terrible human and people like you make me glad I no longer live in TN. This is why everyone looks down at my home.
@SenBobCorker Just lost my re-election vote, and I voted both times, and once when you were my mayor. Shame on you, sir!
@SenBobCorker You are "overly burdensome" to public safety; those who side w/ the gun lobby in selling the safety of children get that label
@SenBobCorker We deserve better, and I expect better than this.
@SenBobCorker thank you for opposing Toomey Machin and protecting the #2A. Mental health is where the focus needs to be, not on #2A rights.
@SenBobCorker the vote is much appreciated by your constituents. Thanks for standing up in Washington.
@SenBobCorker Re: No vote on extended  BG checks. You just spit on 90% of America.
@SenBobCorker we wouldn't want to burden someone buying weapons!
@rherrick3 @SenBobCorker If the current laws are not being applied, what makes you think that new gun laws will do anything to stop killings
@SenBobCorker This is what a political coward resorts to when he shows his true colors and shirks his responsibility to the nation. Shame !!
@SenBobCorker Your vote creates speculation that you were bought by the NRA. Shame on you.
@SenBobCorker #gunlobbywhore
@SenBobCorker Nice spech the NRA prepared for you. What do they tell u to say the next time people get klled by nuts easily buying guns?
@SenBobCorker shame on u4 voting no! Enjoy blood of innocent people on your hands! #MomsDemandAction
@SenBobCorker Thanks for standing up for us law-abiding citizens.
@SenBobCorker Thanks for supporting law-abiding gun owners today.
@SenBobCorker thank you Sen. Corker! Keep up the good work!
@SenBobCorker Stand By Your Guns! You have My Backing! I'm Stuck with Stabenow+Levin. I Know they voted 4 it.
@SenBobCorker Thanks for voting for the NRA and the gun manufacturers today against the overwhelming will of the people. SHAME SHAME SHAME
@SenBobCorker thanks for representing the viewpoint of your supporters and voting against Toomey-Manchin. #TNforCorker
@SenBobCorker Thank you for keeping your oath by abiding by the Constitution.
@SenBobCorker you legit disgust me, enjoy your #nra money. #puppet
@SenBobCorker 90% of law-abiding citizens prefer "burdensome" over dead innocents.
@Subdiva @SenBobCorker 90% was a fake number. Please do not rely on MSNBC for your facts.
Vote for convicted felons rapists and molesters ability to get guns @SenBobCorker  Toomey-Manchin  overly burdensome, creates uncertainty.
@SenBobCorker yahda, yahda
Bowing to special interests: shame“@SenBobCorker: Sen. Corker opposed Toomey-Manchin saying it was overly burdensome & creates uncertainty."
@SenBobCorker Most here has their Obama marching orders, But I thank you for doing the right thing. REAL Tenn citizens thank you.
. @SenBobCorker SHAME! You chose #GunsOverPeople today.
@SenBobCorker You let this horse out of the barn with Yeah on cloture.  No matter which side,  you are despised in TN. Retire now!
@SenBobCorker Your explanation opposing the Toomey-Manchin is pure "bull***t and in direct contrast to the wishes of your constituents.
@SenBobCorker Thank you. You represented me today.
@SenBobCorker Why do you continue to perpetuate the idea that BG checks are a punishment? Another weak excuse.
@SenBobCorker disappointed in your votes today regarding firearms
@SenBobCorker Total cop-out.
@SenBobCorker Embarrassed that you represent my state.
@robertbruce76 @SenBobCorker Don't like Tennessee, then leave, you are not a real Tennessean! Need gas money?
@SenBobCorker Lets see how "uncertain" you are when another pile of children's bodies stack up. God damned White trash.
@flocktard @SenBobCorker Background checks did a lot of good in Boston. Pigs like you need to stay in New York, you fit in with the stench.
@jimmy_cary @SenBobCorker And the right thing is representing REAL  people for the 2nd amendment rights
.@SenBobCorker I suppose T-M was overly burdensome, especially if you are a child molester or rapist trying to buy a gun.
@PaulRyanPeak @SenBobCorker Yes it is. T-M was stupid
