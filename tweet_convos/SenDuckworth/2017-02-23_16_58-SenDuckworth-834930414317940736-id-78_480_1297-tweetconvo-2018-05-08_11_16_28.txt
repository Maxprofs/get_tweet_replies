Seven people shot and killed yesterday in Chicago. What is going on there - totally out of control. Chicago needs help!
As @SenatorDurbin & I recently wrote, if you are serious about stopping the violence, there is a lot we can do http://bit.ly/2m4cd6e 
If that's the case, why didn't you do something with Obama when he was president you had 8 years & it got worse
they did tried to pass stricter background checks that 80% country supported pubs blocked
You didn't ask Obama which means you have more faith in @realDonaldTrump .. as it should be.
issue was pub obstructionism not Obama #wakeup
Whatever you got to tell yourself snowflake
How about Illinois doing something about the GANGS or can't you say the word as a Democrat
what about IN not allowing these criminals to buy guns at gun shows no questions asked
The "ROOT CAUSES" illicit drugs crossing the border with guns and criminals. Pres. Trump IS addressing ROOT CAUSES
many guns come from IN where they can purchase at gun shows no questions asked
Yeah bit where's the money come from. eh?
Pleas Vote Against S.446 Concealed Carry Reciprocity Which Revokes State's Rights Re: Who Is Too Dangerous To Carry Publicly!
why don't you get out there Tammy and try to make a difference instead of sitting on your butt and complaining. Go Talk.
How about she address those who rule Chicagoland? Ruled by Dems. Bitch at Rahm and those north of I-80
Are you seriously that stupid?
I live in north central Illinois, my tax dollars paying for Chicago's problems is not going to solve the problem either!
"Root causes" of Chicago's problems are the policies YOUR party supports. DEM CONTROL for 80+ years.
Tweeting won't stop the violence - How about working to address the root causes of violence like #EconomicJustice & #GunTrafficking? https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/834916167177371648 …
"root causes" ask for more free stuff don't instill a work ethic absentee fathers etc. etc. Tired of paying 4 u!
Root causes correlate with CPS school closings and staged false complaints against black teachers like myself to root them out
I agree but stay focused on #TrumpRussia and #Obamacare #ACA
And stop @jeffsessions! #TheResistance
@LyricalAve And why does he always focus on Chicago?
Obama envy
That and the fact we scared him when we protested outside his UIC rally. He scarpered
OK, but those are national issues. Why do they impact Chicago so much more?
More than where? Detroit? St. Louis? New Orleans? Baltimore? DC? Philadelphia? Miami? All worse. All need help.
seems many of the shooters and victims have a violent record. Maybe stricter sentencing would be where to start.
thank you for representing the people of Illinois 
Yessss! Drag him 
Thank you Senator. He needs to stop talking about Chicago if he isn't going to do anything to help.
neither will talking taking down Trump while libs destroyed Chicago. If I was him I'd tell u to FO Never seen vet so pathetic
. WHAT OBAMA DO. NOTHING. CHICAGO RAN BY DEMOCRATS.
Economic justice? that's another Bernieism talking point with no meaning, just emotional "robin hood" mentality.
thank you!
Well, he could send in the National Guard,but just likes to talk about it.Forget about the "root"cause. Not addressed!
LOL, the National Guard is the only way you can. Regular military, has to go to congress.
And he might!
Using regular military is something that could be a career ender for a lot of people and him!
Finally an adult showed up. Somebody impeach this administration. How can I help?Get Bannon out of our house Stay hard #resist

@IndivisibleIL14 this scares me
@realDonaldTrump The logic here is flawed: "140 character tweets don't work. I know! I'll send a letter of 1,140 characters."
tell us what you have done.....looks like tweeting and nothing for Chicago
@realDonaldTrump He's as sympathetic to those affected in Chicago as he is to families he's breaking up at an alarming rate.
how about #EndtheWaronDrugs
#GunTrafficking can't explain Chicago violence the surrounding states where the guns come from don't have a shooting problem
@JoeNBC You criticize @realDonaldTrump Senator, what the hell have YOU been doing as your constituents are killed DAILY?
this is your state Senator. How long have you been in office?  Replying to a tweet makes you no better. #yousuck
but this works?
Thank You
@ShaggyPaisley @realDonaldTrump have u established r shootings by "real Americans" or immigrants? Worry about basics first
Also crazy people can use us for target practice.
Illinois has comparatively strict weapon statutes, but does not rep a positive correlation. Degrade cartel & gang dynamics.

 well said!!!! #goosebumps #inspired
Trump can only govern in 140 characters or less. #Neverthelessshepersisted
you have done what Senator? gangs, murders every day and nothing changes ur pal Nobama did NOTHING RAHM?all bitch same ol dems
@realDonaldTrump yet you tweet right back #duckworth
It's like you don't understand the concept of legislative staffers who do social media vs BLOTUS. Oh wait, you don't.
what does this even mean?! #economicjustice get off ur ass and work. #guntrafficking talk to ur brother Barry. #jeeesh
Tweeting won't stop the violence - How about working to address the root causes of violence like #EconomicJustice & #GunTrafficking? https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/834916167177371648 …
maybe someone should show this man the rates of violence in the towns near his taxpayer paid golf resort in FL??
WTF is economic justice?
#Trump is working as hard as he can, did you see how bad his drive was on the 7th hole? SAD!
Thank you for speaking out Senator. Proud to say I voted for you & can't wait to see what you will do for Chicago!
He will do more than Obama did over the last 8 years for Chicago, but I'm sure you will complain about how he does it.
ACLU and liberals will be all over it if they step up policing, lawsuits will fly just like in Milwaukee
Good point Senator Duckworth.
didn't vote for you but now am glad you represent us.
@realDonaldTrump really Tammy?  Please explain exactly how your ideas will be effective.
Well said. Good luck to you, Senator Duckworth!
so far, the GOP has been all talk on violence but extremely concerned about where people drop a load. Small govt optional.
Well said.
@realDonaldTrump  How about a plan?  Help @SenDuckworth with something useful for a change.
@ahmed_abusaif 
The root causes are lack of family which our welfare promotes by incenting unwed mothers + mking people dependent. Fix that.
why is no one admitting the violence in Chicago won't end until schools in these neighborhoods are fully funded!!!
Thanks, Senator!
so thankful to have you representing me in Congress. Thank you Senator Duckworth, you are an inspiration.
is the bomb diggy! 
DJT is all about flailing his arms around rather than creating solutions!
I like the idea of @SenatorDurbin - take the wall money and invest in violence prevention. Thank you both for all you do.
You forgot THE MAJOR "ROOT CAUSES" Illegal immigration of drug cartels!
well done, Senator, from 62088
Thank you, Senator!!
