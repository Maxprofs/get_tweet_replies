BERNIE SANDERS IS NOT A DEMOCRAT @SenSchumer
No, he is a strong supporter of progressive ideals, with a large base that look to him for direction- can we afford to split our party?
He's ignoring #Russia  Unacceptable. People around him want to ignore it. That's is where I'm STOPPED. RUSSIA is ALL that matters.
That's not all together true.
Adam Schiff talks about Russian collusion every time he gets in front of the camera. Half the time Bernie goes on to bash Dems. 3/4, even.
How can Dems credibly go after the GOP when they're guilty of many of the same things?
How can anyone go after anyone? This kind of discussion turns into a dog chasing its tail. Focus on what is actually in front of us.
Maybe it's high time they hung it up and passed the torch to the next generation.  It's not like they'll hurt for money in retirement.
You mean work for the liberal Americans! #Stopobstructing
Democrats and independents want a better life for ALL Americans. You know that because that's y conservatives hate them.
Democrats keep passing entitlements and strapping the middle class to pay for them! Then we can't afford our own healthcare! Good try tho!
"keep passing entitlements"...healthcare?
Medicaid, food stamps and welfare was designed to help those in need! It is not to be a way of life and passed down! Middle class is tkg hit
Tell that to disabled people on Medicaid its not a way of life. Democrats didnt make any laws to expand food stamps/welfare
Disabled people are a given..Really think this conversation includes them? Dems did control raising the proverty level to increase Medicaid
Conversation is about people who cant afford access to healthcare, which includes a lot of different groups.
Embrace a progressive platform to win...single payer healthcare, living wage, climate action, keep corporate influence & money out of govt.
Yeah, the progressive platform really won with black voters and a majority of the party. (Sarcasm FYI)
60% chose Hillary over Bernie. Bernie would never win key swing states like Florida because FL Dems tend to be moderate
I can only see Bernie winning in states like Vermont and California but he is too far left for most Democrats.
Personally, it'll be very hard to vote for Bernie if he were our candidate. If he is the future of the party then we are doomed.
If Clinton-wannabes, Wall Street loving centrists, and neoliberal hawks are the Dem future, then they've already lost.
Look If the Democratic party wants to actually win, we have to ride the middle. As much as you don't want to hear it, there's not enough 1/2
On the far left to have a winning strategy in any state other than maybe Cali and the Northeast 2/2
This slogan is awful!
I'm lifelong Dem, HRC supporter: Hear me out - that slogan is TERRIBLE. The vast cluelessness of this slogan is alarming.
Well then, you need dis associate yourselves from the criminal Democrats first. Then we'll talk.
Take Sanders out of this ad. He's not a Democrat and it is insulting to all of us who are.
Amen 
#ABetterDeal is so meh..how about #theRealDeal ? (As opposed to a fake deal)

Right but y'all not cause Carrot top is still there 
YOU GOT US INTO THIS MESS!! And now u blather on about how you're going to fix it. I call #bullshit
They can't even get through their scripts without studdering, they dont even know what they are saying! Out of touch with Americans!
Wow that's a load of you know what. Let's pander to everyone.  Want water, puppies, gold?  Our plan = tell you we will give you all you want
being now? Where were you during the Trillion Dollar rip off, Sent to enemy countries?
Whoops! Guess you know how my last 8 years were...
NO one is saying that they did that.
Skill development & job training, affordable education, affordable & portable healthcare, and union support: exactly what I hoped to see!
America meds to hear more blunt talk from DC Dems not mealy mouthed political niceties.

World's on fire, yo.
You and Bernie should get married in Vermont and then spend your honeymoon in NYC. Please give us all a break. Idiots
Bernie sanders is not a democrat. Get him out of our ads until he joins our party
we dont want him in our party. he tried to change it to his liking. too close to trumps.
He tried to change it from being sold-out to mega donors to working for the ppl again.  Oh the humanity!
#RepealObamacare 
#RepealObamacare 
#RepealObamacare 
#RepealObamacare 
#RepealObamacare
STOP courting big donors & return 2 your populist roots. FDR is not a dirty name, in fact he was one of the greatest presidents we ever had.
It's hard to envision the entrenched current leadership changing anything to upset their gravytrain.Who works #WallStreet better than Chuck?
This is why the #Sandicrats need to go!
As #hellbent for #itsherturn as the 3rdway was in 2016 you'd think they invite Sanders to survive not betterdeal marketing same old same old
They would rather continue losing than elevating OUR concerns/solutions.The democratic was stolen from us some 40+ years ago. Too bad that
https://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/search?startMonth=01&startDay=20&startYear=2009&endMonth=01&endDay=19&endYear=2017 â€¦ that was your damn plan past 8 years. None of u #turnips get it. America is #BROKE. Stop with the I got a plan #shit
or how about the fight for a #livingwage the right to collective bargaining & for heavens sake..STOP attending fundraisers in the Hamptons!
We are missing faces of:
Where does this young man stand?
Why is Bernie Sanders featured? Either become a Dem or go away. Stop being a fair-weather friend.
He's a liberal. Isn't ideology more important than party? Or are we like republicans now and backing people we disagree with on all issues?
Then why does he continue to attack everyone who has the same ideological beliefs. He used the Dem structure to run, then attack it.
I can see your point, but I would argue that he's not so much attacking us as he is pointing out our flaws.
We lost to Trump - something MUST wrong with us for that to have happened and we need to fix whatever it is before we are annexed by Russia.
We need confidence that elected officials are unable to be swayed by big bucks Term Limits, Contributions limits. Kick Big Corporate  out.
Very true! We know Republicans will never do this. But campaign reform and ending citizens united could be done by us pushing democrats
Wanna get conservatives behind ending Citizens United? NP. Outlaw Unions from participating in elections & lobbying 2. Yeah. Didn't think so
Then we all win in the long run because that is the only time the people's voice will be listened to.
That's a nice sentiment, but I'm curious... can u point me to ur protests over the two most costly campaigns in history... Hillary & Obama?
Just looking for a little credibility.
Do you want change or not? Assuming reasons to bash me doesn't bring it. Finding common ground (money out if elections) is a start. No?
We can debate slogans forever.  What we can't do is wait to #ImpeachTrump
This isn't a plan. Its a bunch of washed up dems saying the same stupid shit that lost them the election. God you guys just don't get it! 
That's not a plan, it's a slogan. And a lame derivative one at that.
We believe government should work for you & for the millions of hard working Americans who just need #ABetterDeal. Here's our plan: 
@democrats  #ABetterDeal lacks teeth. Don't think you can gum yer way thru election. Where is climate chg, income disparity, regulation?
Politicians are such a joke. Kid Rock has my vote!
Define "hard working americans" Please.
#45 = AmericanANGST @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @SenCapito @SenJohnMcCain @senrobportman  @cnn @FTV_KS_Senator1  @nytimes @weareoversight
Not impressed w this.
#ABetterDeal would be you politicians leaving us hard working Americans alone! Let the free market work an be amazed at the results!
Then do something constructive and not act like spurned children.  I want I want.   Try constructive non socialist proposals for a change
Because you've lost the trust as you went. To the right on big money donors, on profits for your cronies, on equality & justice for all.
Dear #SenateDemocrats, if you want all the tens of thous of people who lined up for #SenBernieSanders, then make your slogan: We, the People
You libs created this mess. This is a total mess. Gov. needs to stay out of my HC. You own this mess. Ruining the middle class people.
<<<Yawn>>>
The only politician who practices what he preaches in this video is @SenSanders. The rest of you are unbelievable, corporate owned idiots.
You have NOT work for America and Americans since LBJ held office!
OMG!  WHO CAME UP WITH THIS?   "A BETTER DEAL" WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? YOU ARE PLAYING TRUMP'S GAME, AMERICA IS DEALING WITH REAL LIFE ISSUES!
Democrats and #ABetterDeal why not just make ONE DEAL WITH AMERICA and Here's The BEST DEAL EVER TERM LIMITS 
BTW - if you wanted this message to seem somewhat genuine - you should have left out Sanders, Warren, and that Nut from CA - Kamala Harris!
This is embarrassing for the Democrats! Cut the bullshit! Put as much effort into working w/your counterparts to Repeal Obamacare!  #MAGA!
America does need a better deal - now let's see how you vote on the Health Care
Your Message is too late!   You have destroyed your Party!   You have proven that you are NUTTY as they come!
When did this happen? You have done nothing but destroy our country for eight and one-half years and counting. You all need to resign. Crook
Plz share with ur friends and relatives, get the message out, can't afford to lose again. Register and Vote, let ur voices be heard 
Dems plan: give away more free shit
Corporate interests don't control Washington they control you, The Democratic party
The Democratic party will do nothing for the working class
#ABetterDeal how about this one #MedicareForAll estimated $2.2 Trillion dollars in economic productivity that's jobs and money
#ABetterDeal how about this one from FDR
Lolololol
#MAGA
#ProtectOurCare #ACA @GOP #FIXitDontNIXit AMERICA DESERVES #ABetterDeal
Just more senseless rhetoric, sounds like talk of years gone by, there is more hope in a dream coming true than what these politicians say.
The best deal would be if you'd get out of our lives and stop lying. We don't need your socialism. It just doesn't work.
@SenSchumer's recent "#ABetterDeal"  sure reminds me an awful lot of Hillary's 2015 speech, only #SheSaidItBetter
OMG! How pathetic. Please retire and let true progressives in to move this nation forward instead of backwards.
#Snowflakes  #TheTruthHurts #YouLost #WeWin #MAGA
Beware of democrats offering me a better deal. Avoid dems job killing regulations and employer mandates High min wage=lost jobs - pure fact
I like this unified message! This is something that I can get behind. THIS is something I can give my vote
This majority's not working creating a new economy and 10millions of sustainable jobs.Republicans wont even discuss infrastructural projects
Healthcare like Education should be formost in growing a strong productive nation. 
Republicans Only serve the 1%.
I'm all for reform and re-branding, but why was it necessary to slap HRC in the process of announcing it? What was the point of that?
So get behind #singlepayer  #raisingthewage #publiceducation (not charter) supporting #unions etc! Policies that the American ppl want!

Have to learn how to become the party of the working class again and NOT the welfare party
I don't want a better deal, better than what? But not the best? Sorry 
I want the Real Deal
This desperation at EPIC LEVELS. There's NOTHING you can do, to change the corruption within your party! #DemsAreDoneFor
Please make sure you always have plans and answers ready - don't make the mistake of republicans and spend years just saying no.
@SenStabenow repeal and replace!
U Dems r nothing but bald faced liars. The American ppl know this.
@SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @SenSanders @HouseDemocrats @DNC Defeat #trumpcare then #singlepayernow. We deserve an #NHSforUSA. #MedicareForAll
Not good enough.We want #singlepayernow. We deserve an #NHSforUSA. #MedicareForAll @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @SenateDems @DNC @SenSanders
Free pizza for everyone! #papajohns
U lost due 2 you're out of Touch W/ people's needs not wants humans need opportunity 2 grow, not free stuff, but earned
Until you get leadership again and then it's all SJW nut jobs, all the time instead.
U blew it & continue to do so.
America does not want your same policies, we now have what we want and need.
Don't u get it?
Why is Berne in this video, he isn't a Democrat ?
We do need a better deal!!America has always been great. Companies getting rid of 50 yr olds because 20 yr olds are cheaper. No loyalty!!
You've got squat. Nothing.
Why didn't any of you work for us when ObamaCare was shoved down our throats?
Let's make government a lot smaller and reduce taxes.  That would help.
Come on, let's be honest. ANY deal where the government is the solution sucks from the beginning and is doomed to fail. #BetterDeal
radical campaign financing reform, then. $10 limit from individual Americans. Nothing from PACs and corporations and foreign govts. Period.
The video seems amateurish. Go to the best videographers and branding experts that you can find! It's worth the time & money to do over.
#ABetterDeal
Great slogan---like the New Deal for the 21 st Century.
Keep fighting for us. Don't give up.
NO! Don't feed me tired old white men Democratic babble. I want to see YOUNG WOMEN & LOTS OF THEM representing me & I'm OLD! #StillWithHer
To Late!
You have got to be kidding ! democrats for the people? taxes regulation social engineering. BS , far left democrats want one thing..POWER
Thank you for taking up some of @HillaryClinton policies - run with it but please stop throwing her & 66 million of her voters under the bus
I'd like it better if you took Bernie out.  He's why we have Trump now!
PATHETIC LIBERALS PLAYING POLITICS WITH HEALTH CARE! VOTE KID ROCK
Lmao  this is some insane fake scripted BS
If you want us to take this really  seriously, don't lead with an old white guy. And certainly don't add @BernieSanders.
Lead with @SenKamalaHarris or @SenDuckworth to show us you're ready.
Yours is the party of cheating, lies and scandal #clintonemails #benghazi #fastandfurious #irs #uranium1
The American people got a #ABetterDeal on November 8 2016 and his has been winning ever since. He name is Donald Trump aka @POTUS
Where is FREE COLLEGE, Single Payer Healthcare, and more funding for Planned Parenthood? This platform is not progressive enough.
Wait, @SenSanders is now a democrat?
Love it!
What a joke. They talk about ideas with no plan 2 achieve them. The Dems r taking people 4 suckers. Sad, some ppl believe this is great.
"...it is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing."  #ABetterDeal
Shouldn't it be the best deal? Why shoot for just better?
Nope you believe that the government should control your life from birth to death. You want people on welfare not working
They offer NOTHING!! #WherestheBeef
I'm just curious as to why you didn't do this when you held all the power and could have literally done anything you wanted???
Stop taking corporate money. Otherwise, you are simply corrupt traitors.
WHY is BERNIE @SenSanders in this video? He IS not and has NEVER been a member of MY/OUR PARTY! Enough already. He DOES NOT REPRESENT US!
Democrats are dumb
Fix the #VoterSuppression problem. And tell @SenSchumer to stop trashing Hillary Clinton. HE's our message problem. Also, #neverbernie.
I know he's supposed heir to Reid but I never really trusted Schumer. @sherrilee7 @SenateDems @SenSchumer
@SenateDems are NOTHING MORE than wolves in sheep's clothing. #ABetterDeal is dead-on-arrival. #NeoLiberal agenda is FINISHED! #DemExit
Nah, I'll take care of my own deal. Thanks. Now, get out of the way please.
You had your chance and did nothing with it. Your new slogan is negative to what you've done but IS the mess you've created. #voterepeal
That's the problem with old dudes making up new slogans & have no creativity..
You need to do #WhatsBestForAmerica w/fresh ideas & new faces
The working families of this country want government out of their lives not more control over it
I like it
Best joke ever!! HaHaHa
Kid Rock is leading in the polls against Stabenaw!!. That is if you believe in polls!!
"We're working harder than ever to export your jobs overseas  - or import an illegal to fill your job here.".......
Stopped watching as soon as @BernieSanders appeared. He is not a Democrat and has no business in this video.
Why is HE speaking for Democrats. HE is NOT a DEM. He is a #Sandicrat.  It is all about HIM. Let him form his own #Sandicrat Party
A better deal huh? You've provided nothing but the sh!ttiest of deals for the last decade. You guys suck at deals, always have.
stupid logo, stupid slogan, reduces an important issue to the gutter...sad
why settle for a #betterdeal when we already have the #bestdeal that Pres. Trump will deliver without your obstructionism.
We don't want what that traitor is doing to our country. Now buzz on back to your basket,
thanks to us deplorables your Hillary is still walking in the woods. Please troll elsewhere.
@DNC seems to disingenuous and hypocritical.
Yep, we're out here working hard while Chuck Schumer lives on our tax dollars for his entire adult life. Now he has great "ideas". Awesome.
#PutinBot
My*Vision is a POTUS who passed healthcare for all & gave citizens the right to direct how 65% of their tax contributions are spent. 
Dems using the Papa Johns Ad to say they will "get better" at hiding thier crimes than before instead of letting Russia expose them.
Example:my son passed away I lived with him&we had 2 salaries my SS&his paycheck now all I have is SS&I can't afford to buy medicine or food
Meanwhile
...Good first step...in follow up video showcase the other 26 Senators and their names so that we are ALL represented.
- I'm with her
When they say government

What they're really saying is you taxpayers need to pay 

No more redistribution of wealth
Disappointed.  I was hoping you were all tendering your resignations so we could get some people in office that weren't crooked
Says the guy who supports the most corrupt and treasonous POTUS in history.
#ABetterDeal is an epic failure of a slogan. You will lose again with  this. It has #AntiTrump witten all over it. We need more than that!

a deal involves negotiation. it can't be better unless it can get passed. talk to each other & make it happen. here's a slogan 'do your job'
I've stuck with you and voted all along, but it IS time that you all GET THE MESSAGE
LOL YOU ARE BETTER THAN LATE NITE COMEDY #betterdeal
The only thing Demonrats care about are illegal criminals, men & women using the same bathrooms and controlling our healthcare. NO THANKS.
If the Govt works for us, why are those in government getting richer and the rest of us poorer?
You have forgotten the 65.8 million @HillaryClinton  voters, we count, she was cheated and so were we.
Good idea.  Poor slogan.  You need to hire branding and marketing experts to help.  This is not the 1930s.
How about: "Slogans Don't Get The Job Accomplished, Democrats Do" #SlogansDoNotGetTheJobDoneDemocratsDo
Nope you gave up on those people.  Dem went for groups, tribes and excluded white Christian people
Well then start acting now by working with the current @potus to make changes NOW. If you dont agree then this is a political scam as usual.
sorry i will not re-tweet anything with Bernie in it, he is NOT my DEM voice or even a DEM. NO thanks.
Make america America Again
No mention of climate change or equality
A whole lot of talking points with zero specifics on how you're going to do it.
Nice plan, BUT, y'all are missing faces and voices of many younger Leaders. This is major rub for many younger/progressive voters.
policies that you can face up to a $250K fine & a maximum of $1 million and 20 years in jail. No better deal for Palestinians.#BDS
Need more middle class jobs, not just in infrastrucure. Dems need to take on corp America head on!!!!
I wonder how many of these Senators signed on 2 the AIPAC bill to silence the 1st amendment.That is you criticized Israel & its Racist #BDS
#healthcareoffwallstreet
Like #universalhealthcare,breaking up monopolies,blocking Monsanto and Bayer merger,regulating wall st,a 21st century Glass-Steagall?
The percentage of wealth owed by the middle class has gone down in direct proportion to the loss of union jobs.
When the top people in the party take $$$ to speak (secretly) at Goldman Sachs, I have a hard time believing that we're on the same side.
A slogan! You got to be kidding me? Another Slogan. You dems never learn!
Good message that Hillary ran on but I want to see you out selling it! Take back some of the energy from Trump!
Democrats are a joke! Why don't y'all apologize to the American public for thinking and saying we are stupid, deplorable & uninformed.
You believe you should make ultimate decisions on who lives and who dies while you rob us blind
@SenSanders is NOT A FUCKIN DEMOCRAT DAMNIT!
That was awful. Reads bad as Hillary toothpaste commerical ads. Hollow & cliche talking pts. No real new ideas. #ABetterDeal? Same old cr*p.
This is not what we need to win. Harris, Castro, Kennedy & Booker need to lead.
So... Dems admit we need #ABetterDeal because last 8 yrs of Obama screwed them. Trump won on this message.
I just really feel that we need a game-changer strategy from the Democrats. Not more of the same. I don't mean to be a downer, but damn!
You're the scumbags who want to keep bringing in illegals & refugees that DRIVE DOWN WAGES!
Democrats Better Deal = 
What's MINE is MINE  What's YOURS is MINE
Gotta make use of the Antifa outfits as we don't want to throw them away!
Check the mirror, righty.
I just checked your followers 
About time! #ABetterDeal
As a progressive, I know I should be all lit up but, frankly, this seems dull and I feel that it won't reach people it needs to.
"The media could not be played." "The media could not be played.""The media could not be played.""The media could not be played."
isn't that what we pay them to do. Work r us. Revive haven't gotten that memo yet, couple of centuries behind
stop screwing the disabled. hows that?
Stop taking #corporate money and doing your big $ donors bidding. Then we will talk! @justicedems need to take over @DNC
A deal that compromises true democracy
in a democratic republic is a lost cause, neither
party has anything to boast about.
You've messed up for 8 yrs and now you think u can fix it. Well why didn't u fix it before?????
