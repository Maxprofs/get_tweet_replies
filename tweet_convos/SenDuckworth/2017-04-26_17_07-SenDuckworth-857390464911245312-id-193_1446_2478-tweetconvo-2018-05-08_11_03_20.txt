they want to use nukes, wanted this stunt as a pro-forma way to "consult" with congress
ya but now he can nuke NK "after consultation with the Senate"
Well, yes, but then Trump wouldn't have had the great satisfaction of ordering you all to the WH, like the King he thinks he is.
@CBSNews Betsy goes to Atlanta! #NRAAM2017 #FuckTheNRA #Atlanta #TheResistance #MurderLobby #BetsyRiot #2a #2A #RESIST #GunSense
BETSY HAS BRASS BALLS
I'm arranging to humiliate Senate in bus visit to my house to explain how to toast bread. They know how, but it's distracting. #russiatrump
But remember Donny doesn't read.  #Sad #distraction
I did!
It was another Dog-and-Pony show brought to you by no other than inept @realDonaldTrump
It's just self-important narcissist @realDonaldTrump trying to make himself appear @POTUS-ie with First 100 Days coming. @GOP @DNC @CNN
Waste of time just another photo op for loco potus, that's shameful!
@morgfair and wouldn't  it have been easier for one person  to go to meet 100 people than the other way around?
yes but 45s warped logic dictates that if he's doing the summoning to his turf he's "powerful"
...but she'd be crying foul if she was only able to read about it from the papers.
The WH meeting was about Trump exerting dominance, making the entire Senate sit and stay on command.
Just some more WH drama to give guy with little hands and opportunity to feel big
This inept WH can't even get a dog and pony show right. #Trumprussia #ImpeachTrump #Resistance
I had no idea you Fucknards love Animals but holes, but on Twitter!
When people are so intent on getting their second rate insults out that they can't even make a coherent sentence, lol
Magic trick, tape recorder. Recored your voice reading my words out loud. When done play it back.Wallah! Spelling Grammar Errors all gone!
It's "voila", btw. It's French.
Trump managed to hijack a news cycle with this stunt. Will he run out of stunts before he is impeached? It's a "game" apparently.
@POTUS What a farce! Nothing but a damn bannon-trump Admin hype job! A 100 senators, 400+ reps and all show, no real new info. Sad.  MD
Trump just did that because he could .. so idiotic!
This was a way to take attention off of #TrumpRussia and all the 100day comparisons
Is it just me or is @POTUS becoming even more delusional?
@pmm526 @SenDuckworth "reading is fundamental" and comprehension. Thanks Senator!
Sounds like another of use of tax payer dollars as well as a water off  senator's time.
I agree with her Anderson- when the senators walked out of the meeting, they all seemed perplexed!
Ask this moron where was obama the last 8 years. Another failure
Thank goodness my state is well represented & not obscuring sh*tshow
@MalcolmNance @SenDuckworth @CNN The WH just wanted to look like they were doing something important.  Potemkin presidency.
Another desperate attempt to seem relevant. Swing and a miss, again.
.@AC360 .@SenDuckworth trump got his info for briefing from staff who googled it for him moments before.  He can't read & fired smart ppl
Here is another example of the Trump team wasting our tax dollars to put on a media show
All fluff to make us believe there is unity and progress.
Lesson: when Trump tries to use you for photo op and to manipulate you into being compliant, just say NO.
@SenDuckworth you have become a rude, nasty woman...no excuse for your behavior.
I'm sure all of us will be reading it in the newspapers after you leak it to them.
Seems to be the consensus from most Senators D's and R's.  A big waste of time and money.  Photo op at best.
Dog & Pone Show.
It's not what @realDonaldTrump  @PressSec are drinking, the MYSTERY is, #whomixesit?
More bad theatre in place of actually working at the job of being President.  Pathetic.
Me too!!
Just a made up show for trumps first 100 days
Seeing that Trump cannot read... he must have thought everyone has the same issue & needed a format similar to what only he can use 

All Trump did was to put on a show with a parade of buses. He thinks he is still doing reality tv.
It was short of parading our military down the street like North Korea

This was the ALL Senators @WhiteHouse field trip.  #DogAndPonyShow
Fake news
What a pitiful and pathetic fool is this orange madman!
Oh geez still read "the newspaper"? No wonder people think politicians are out of touch. How about saying "browse some websites" instead?
But it's news to DumbDonald so he's absolutely certain no one else could have been aware of it. Dunning-Kruger poster child in Da WhytHowz!
Me on WH holocaust remembrance statement: "I could've gotten that from the Holocaust Museum website's 'Introduction to the Holocaust' page."
Is it possible TRUMP CLEARED THE SENATE SO THE SENATE COULD BE BUGGED??? SENATE hearing place? Gotta QUESTION EVERY MOVE TRUMP MAKES!
No wonder it was new to Trump!
The "Briefing" was a sidebar, the reality was proving, he could summon
the entire Senate, to him. Surprisingly, it wasn't to the SWH.
surprised they didn't have a Foxcaster read the report so Trump could attest to having heard it - when was last time he read anything
Good, then you won't be surprised when we take out his launch capabilities and his weapons stockpile.  We'll put his program back years...
Imagine that a Democrat criticizing this Administration #notnews stop putting ex-Clinton and Obama talking heads on your network
Then read the paper
Trump hubris the fictional reality of Trump narcissism needs sheep to worship him, dragging senators to his palace changes them to his sheep
At this point, "dog and pony show" is an improvement over what we've been getting. Thank you for serving IL, Senator.
But was a visitor log created for the Senators?
''Is there not a room big enough at the Senate"- Did Anderson Cooper really ask that question?" LMAO, it just gets better & better.
His go-to, obvious use of diversions could get us all vaporized.
And North Korea watches and gets pumped up that POTUS reacts by bringing everyone to WH  for this meeting.
@Haugmoen @SenDuckworth Tammy says it you can believe it ! Wish she was my senator .

trump just wanted to show he has power big bully
@SenDuckworth was this a distraction? Why does MSM like @CNN follow the lies of #Trumprussia ? #IndependentInvestigation
why did you go? you got punked by trump
"It felt more like a dog and pony show than anything else."- @SenDuckworth @AC360 on the #WH #NorthKoreaBriefing .
This was nothing more than a show of power. Another display of wasted tax payers money. I hope Trump is forced to pay it back when impeached
@AngelaKrebs444 Dog and PHONY Show I think!
IF SHE HAD NOT FELL ASLEEP SHE MIGHT HAVE NOT SEEN THE DOG AND HORSE F N EACH OTHER! SICK MINDS
Useless showboating. All other Presidents would have gone to the hill. But not the little Dick-tator. Those who went should be embarrassed
Please tell me they at least put Spicey in the Easter Bunny to amuse the senators during the "pre-show"
I doubt it you partisan hack
It's all so stupid. Trump presidency is a joke
So! A lot of folks would have considered it an honor to hear personally from any of our presidents . Maybe you should change jobs.
Trump doesn't read newspapers. Scratch that. Trump doesn't read. @senduckworth @ac360
Just another self-glorying exercise by the raging narcissist
Hey, It was new to him. #amiright #DonnyDoesntKnow #DumbDonald

#NationalDisgrace #InternationalEmbarrassment
If this was supposed to be a show of strength or a symbol of some sort, it kinda fizzled.
@Fishbooom @SenDuckworth @CNN Thank you Senator - an honest woman.
@MalcolmNance @SenDuckworth Senators got punk. Everyone come to Trump. When is he going to come to others. He is not a King.
Mattis asked trump have his dog & pony show to pander to his ego..McMaster & mattis are calling the shots
Insane. And that's the polite assessment. They brought 100 busy senators to the White House to tell them that nothing is new. #TrumpRussia
I believe her this dog & pony show was more trump Bull $hit He doesn't know how to Govern or Lead
If they hadn’t briefed you, you’d be wailing about how the White House wasn’t informing congress.
Which prompts the reply "Where do you think that THEY got the info in the first place?" Very few are actually doing anything in this admin.
Why is anyone surprised? Be like Trump: always think about how it will look on TV. Be all about the optics.
Yes, but what about Russia and the restrooms.  That's what we want to know about. And we need more glamour shots of Obama.
it was just a show.
Sore loser whines...
It was a stunt to deflect the Flynn story
A total power play...this meeting is the equivalent to his ridiculous handshakes
Classic Trump: huge build up with no actual decision/action/info of significance.
@MalcolmNance @SenDuckworth This was a stunt.
@MalcolmNance @SenDuckworth @CNN dog and pony show
Well, he only knows what's on Fox & Friends, so...
"Dog & Pony Show" -- I think Sen. Duckworth hit the nail on the head!
#FakePresident #DontBombKorea #ChillOutGOP
Lol. #TrumpRussia distraction, plus another day delayed, plus whatever Pence was doing abroad - couldn't have been too important.
@MalcolmNance @SenDuckworth @CNN but the duct tape
Another fucking waste if tax payer $ by the grifter in chief
Where do you think @realDonaldTrump got it from? Nope!! He only watches TV.
Pray for our nation. Trump is a loser. #donthecon
Be Rump show to make him look important
That goes to show how little this administration knows about what they are doing.
THey bitch when they are not called they bitch when they are called
@ABC  Betsy goes to Atlanta! #NRAAM2017 #FuckTheNRA #Atlanta #TheResistance #MurderLobby #BetsyRiot #2a #2A #RESIST #GunSense
It's a power trip for Trump.
y'all better sweep your offices. Drumpf just pulled you away so Russia could access the capital building
Old CEO Trick,  Make people come to them.  Show them you are in charge.  Sorry he wasted your time, but saw that coming.
Dog and pony, for sure.
Some of these dems are salty as fuck
Go Tammy!! 
AC, really? That was the best content the team could come up with to lead your show? You gave her 3 minutes to rant? Low point for u.
a disgrace to have a senator that leaves a confidential meeting at the white houseyje go straight to an interview on cnn to talk about it
It sounds like it was nothing she couldn't find out by reading a newspaper or watching the news, so I don't see the problem.
But let's scare the world into thinking WWIII is imminent, because that's, the Trump way.
Smoke and mirrors so all media will talk about his 100 day activities.
It was a power move and nothing more.  He got the Senate to come to him. For nothing.
dog and pony show sums up 45's run so far
They were bussed in like a bunch of elementary school kids on a field trip!  waste of their time.
...and intelligence. My God,  the whole works looked like a bunch of lemmings going to the cliff.
Senator Sanders did not take part in this bus trip joke. Any other senator looks moronic by attending this clown show.
So, ask yourself why they wanted you out of the Capitol
Need to have the offices checked for bugs, eavesdropping equipment and etc
Or is that having them bugged ?
The whole point was to call that renegade Senate to Trump's carpet. "They came to me"!
Don't insult dog and pony's
@ZeddRebel @SenDuckworth well this WH isn't big on using paper. Maybe they're tree huggers after all?
I'm telling ya...he's the @POTUS who cried wolf.
I would check my office for bugs when I got back...
"a dog & pony show" , as the Senator called it is probably spot on. A distraction & waste of time...
@SenDuckworth thank you for not sugar coating what's going on. It's refreshing to hear the truth in the midst of all this.
go Tammy!
It's against scty regs to confirm info in the newspaper when it is marked classified. If, in fact, briefing was TS, Sens shld be careful.
Isn't that the point: "The President does not read"
Sounds like someone is butthurt that they had to do actual work today.  #MAGA
I bet Trump tweeted more information than he briefed a 2-bus load of senators who had better things to do for the day.
Well! There You Go! Orange Genius, & White House Staffers Can't Read Newspapers! Get All Info From FOX Propaganda!
Why am I not surprised? #FlaccidDonald needs to find some reason to pretend his #100days of nothing isn't really. He's a #Loser #Nincompoop
The star of the "reality" show, The Apprentice, #FlaccidDonald, needed to bus over  to the WH100 US Senators for a publicity opportunity.
If u want to keep ur ratings down. Keep having Lord on. Can't  talk about anything but Reagan's policies from the 80's!
WTF?
Dems senators are so stupid
Exactly...another strike out 2 add 2 the growing list!
That's my senator!!! You're awesome Tammy! @SenDuckworth
Not very reassuring, either. Come on Congress...stand up to him!!!!!
It sounds like they all got together and decided to say the same thing
F
For Looser. 
Impeach this bum now before its too late.
This Awful man is playing President, & not being a president.
And how much did it cost
Spoke with someone that lives overseas and they said people ask  "what's wrong with Americans" because of who our president is smh 
Not party but common sense tells you this was a total waste of time & money all for optics. Typical DT priorities.
AC deliberately sought out this nitwit to undermine the President bc we all know AC hates Trump
No longer has his show "The Apprentice" so he enjoys theater of having you all assemble at his beck and call. It's a pathetic cry for help.
I hadn't thought of that, but good point! It's just like that.
She's fundraising already. It's what base wants to hear. Anything to denigrate Trump. That goes for @andersoncooper as well. #veryfakenews
Somebody put to keep you honest
But it was all about Trump,  not Korea.  That was the point
That does seem lost on the deplorables. Do they think they're immune to nuclear blasts? People not taking this seriously, need to start
LOL
What a waste of a post. Why is this news ?
Those Senators just got suckered into giving Trump a big photo op. 2 b used on twitter next time he fucks up. Can u guys say CON ARTIST?
Time that could have been spent on better things...like #TrumpRussia or #SaveACA or #FairTaxes
Did the president suggest she watch Fox&Friends for the other part of the briefing?
but how was the kimchi and chocolate cake and quality time with the narcissistic self absorbed fat boy with the bad hair???
Know you make these stupid comments to deflect from your russian involvement. Not going to work! @realDonaldTrump @SenDuckworth
