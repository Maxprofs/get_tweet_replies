Betsy DeVos refused to commit to enforcing the law to protect students with disabilities. Watch the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fftskn5HFdA&feature=youtu.be â€¦
Does this mean you are committed to vote no on DeVos' nomination, @SenDuckworth? Public schools = public good. Need a Sec of Ed that agrees!
Please do not give her your vote
@SenatorDurbin please vote NO on Betsy DeVos.  Our children, public education and our future deserve better.
DeVos terrifies me. Please #DumpDeVos! ALL kids deserve a quality education & #EducationSecretary familiar with IDEA!!
please do not confirm DeVos. She can't advocate what she doesn't know. We can't risk time lost for her learning curve.
@SenatorHassan @YouTube u r just against Choice wll show up your horrd educ systm Stop holding thngs up &approv or we DTS of u
@SenatorHassan say no to DeVos - ALL children deserve BETTER
@SenatorHassan DeVos lacks basic quals for the position; she & Sessions would likely dismantle IDEA.
@SenatorHassan @YouTube Please vote no!
please vote no.
As your constituent, I ask you to vote NO on DeVos. #DumpDevos
Based on this, please commit to a "no" vote on her confirmation!
@SenatorHassan please vote NO on DeVos!!!
@SenatorDurbin I appreciate your #resistance on so many fronts--today's the day to VOTE DOWN Betsy DeVos for Education Sec'y!
Absolutely no to Betsy DeVos. The last thing we need is further privatization of education and policies that fail to improve our ed systems.
I absolutely agree.  Will you vote against her nomination?
as a Special Educator, thank you for supporting education at large and civil rights for our students with disabilities.
Vote NO on DeVoss!!!
Thank you! Please vote "no" and convince others!  Keep up the good work. (Constituent & Duckworth Voter)
@SenatorHassan demand another hearing and/or block her confirmation in any way possible.  Disaster for education.
@KatieOsgood_ @SenatorHassan @YouTube If u go on an interview and u don't know the basics/ no job 4 u!
@SenatorHassan @SenatorDurbin As your constituent please vote NO to Betsy Devos' nomination!
@SenatorHassan please vote no!!
Absolutely! Please vote NO to Betsy Devos
DeVos doesn't want to protect all students. Her past shows: business matters more than creating a good educated citizen.
please vote NO!!!! Unqualified
thank you for voting against her. Proud to call you my Senator!
please vote no to DeVos !!! She is extremely unqualified
Live in IL raised in MI, son of an educator there. There is no choice with Devos. Vote NO. A yes vote means you have been compromised
She was exposed for what she is. Unqualified and unprepared. Never went to public school and has never taught!
Betsy DeVos is highly unqualified. Please vote NO.
Vote No on her confirmation! #OpposeDeVos #IDEA #CerebralPalsy
Please vote NO on Ms DeVos!  She's unqualified to be Secretary of Education.
When we have a "president" who's not familiar with the Constitution, a nominee not familiar with dept goals is no surprise.
Please block her nomination!! Resist!
@SenatorHassan @YouTube Think we can get 3 republicans to get their head out of their ass and do the right thing?
please vote NAY!
@MaddowBlog I no
@SenatorHassan @YouTube 
Please speak out against the appointment of Betsy De Vois for Secretary of Education
Education system is a bit fucked up anyways. Common Core what a idea. Like FN Gym class is educational. YFR lady. Just sayin
@MaddowBlog vote no Tammy,  I'm a constituent in 60002
You'll do your fellow Illinoisans a disservice if you approve of DeVos's #EducationSecretary nomination. Give her the boot!
@SenatorHassan Ms. Duckworth - please vote no on Betsy DeVos. She is unqualified to be #education secretary.
@MaddowBlog that woman destroyed the public school funding in Michigan and gave BILLIONS to private districts. Stop her!
suggest he have his own levels tested.
@SenatorHassan ?...or keep guns out of schools. No more gun-free zones. Smart. Of course, no more public schools, either.
I don't get the impression DeVos is even familiar with the existence of ideas, let alone IDEA.
@SenatorDurbin  Please vote NO on DeVos for Secretary of Education. She is unqualified.
-vote no for DeVos. Thank you for helping protect our children's education.
@MaddowBlog @SenatorHassan To be fair, this whole admin is being built on a lack of ideas. And on lies and incompetence...
Thank you for supporting the rights of ALL children. It is shocking that #DeVos is so unprepared - disqualifying! #DumpDevos
- pls vote NO on Betsy DeVos for #EducationSecretary. As a teacher & citizen concerned for students with this nominee!
keep fighting for us! Voted for you!
thank you Senator! Spoke with your office about my concerns of Mrs De Vos' unfitness for the position.
thank you for raising this concern! Please vote no!
Absolutely! Her appalling lack of knowledge about IDEA must disqualify her. She knows nothing about public education.
Reply to @SenDuckworth Called your office today to ask that you vote NO on #BetsyDeVos  What will you do?
vote NO!
@SenatorHassan not having knowledge of IDEA is reason enough to vote no, but DeVos have you many more!
I teach special need students. Each one of them has a gift, it is our job to cultivate it. This woman scares me.
@MaddowBlog @SenatorHassan @YouTube but she's rich -- her son paid a lot if money for her to get that job, so.....
@MaddowBlog I stand with you
@SenatorHassan as a mother of a child with a disability, this is horrifying. Please represent IL with a "no" vote!
@MaddowBlog @SenatorHassan @YouTube Continue to stand strong and #resist this appt
@MaddowBlog @SenatorHassan  this is so upsetting to me since most all my jobs were with special needs
@MaddowBlog It's embarrassing how unqualified she is. Please vote no on her appointment.
@MaddowBlog @SenatorHassan @YouTube  THIS WOMAN IS NOT SUITABLE FOR THIS JOB.
@MaddowBlog @SenatorHassan Agree. What's the plan after she's confirmed? Pls say you all have one.
@hopesprings46 @SenatorHassan @YouTube I'm loosing all hope as we have criminals going to run USA.  I'm starting to hate it.
@MaddowBlog @SenatorHassan Charters can easily say, "We don't have SPED services available at our school. Try elsewhere."
@MaddowBlog @SenatorHassan Private schools don't have to take students who qualify through IDEA.
please vote no on Betsy DeVos
@MaddowBlog @SenatorHassan If DeVos looked objectively at charter successes vs. public schools, she might be embarrassed.
Thank you for calling her out like that. As one an IL resident, I look forward to you voting against her appointment.
thank you for understanding! My mother is a SpEd teacher for severe and profound children... it's imperative they're protected
@MaddowBlog @SenatorHassan It's sad she probably couldn't, or wouldn't, get hired except for lunch duty by a public school.
@MaddowBlog @SenatorHassan @YouTube so how are you goin to stop her??
@MaddowBlog @SenatorHassan @YouTube Thank you Senators for doing all you can for education on our country.
@SenatorHassan as a school psychologist and a constituent please vote no on DeVos!
@MaddowBlog @SenatorHassan @YouTube but can you ladies convince a R to vote with you? Support of her by Rs is embarrassing!
DO YOU THINK SHE MEANY IKEA?
Damn "Republican Christians" never read far enough to find the part about  "Money is the Root of all Evil"
I watched that fiasco. Mrs Davos should step aside for being that unqualified.  This is a prime example of Pay for Play. #sigh
@MaddowBlog @SenatorHassan @YouTube @SenWhitehouse @SenJackReed @RepCicilline @jimlangevin Betsy DeVos is patently unqualified
Please vote No on #DeVos As an educator-our schools and our students deserve better. #saynotodevos
@MaddowBlog @SenatorHassan @YouTube Please Vote NO

@MaddowBlog @SenatorHassan @YouTube * #BetsyDeVos thought "IDEA" referred to her personal abilities to hv Ideas.
What kids?
@MaddowBlog @SenatorHassan Let alone an understanding of best practices....
she has no business heading up the Dept of Education
@MaddowBlog @SenatorHassan @YouTube Thank You!
@SenatorHassan @SenatorDurbin She is supremely unqualified. Please vote no on DeVos as ed secretary.
Please vote no on her confirmation! Our kids deserve better. #EducationSecretary
DeVos is wrong for this position.
Please block #DeVosconfirmation I voted for you!!
@SenatorHassan @YouTube Please convince Republican senators to vote #NoonDevos!!!!!
