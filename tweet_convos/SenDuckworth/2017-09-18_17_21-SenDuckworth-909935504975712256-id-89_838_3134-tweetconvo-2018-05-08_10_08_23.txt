You are speaking to me @SenDuckworth :-) <3
Motherhood is not something to be ashamed about, expecting mothers to feed their children in bathrooms IS shameful
thank you!!!
I had to pump on a toilet while on Active Duty, 6 weeks after my 1st baby. It made an already stressful experience harder.
As long as men and women need to eat and drink in the bathroom as well.
TY for speaking up for new moms. After I had my 1st 2/3, I was told the loo was the only place for me to express milk after returning to 1/4
work after my 3 mos unpaid leave was up. As the only female engineer on staff both times, I asked my bosses, "did you eat your 2/4
breakfast on the toilet today? Because that's what you're telling me to do for my child." It's unsanitary, gross & demeaning. 3/4
To new moms - I highly recommend calling & getting your local @LaLecheLeagueUS involved. They saved me & my babies from this fate. Fin/

Thank You
This is just another reason why I am so proud to have @SenDuckworth represent me.
Who has the hang ups about this? I very conservative but I have no problem with women breast feeding or pumping when they need to. Whipemout
Thank you @senduckworth   Not sure why supporting mothers and families like this is not part of the "family values" agenda.
Pump and use a bottle when out...why must libs make the world change for them?
The majority of the world has no problem with women breastfeeding their children. Why is the right not willing to support this family issue?
This was also my experience when I went back to graduate school!
I had to do that every day after my daughter was born.  I was working at a Catholic School.
Because we so respect mothers. It's a function of our culture of respect for women. Just ask Trump- but not while he's golfing.
No they should not. We should not be shamed for our breasts. I get angry.. At the beach I see men with bigger breast than mine no shirt on.
my 6yr old girl & I talk about that. why can guys walk around with no shirts, but girls cant.
It is not right.  I am not saying I want to go out in public without a shirt but if I do I get arrested. Man with bigger breast than mine ok
Yeah its not fair.
When I called in to your office, you phone staff didn't even know your stance on it. Do your damn job!
Where is your statement on the hideous Graham/Cassidy bill? Use the voice that we gave you! Renounce it!
Yes, yes and more yes! You express milk to feed your child in the same place people go to the bathroom! How disgusting.
I had to pump in the bathroom stall at work. Another woman reported me, and I was reprimanded by my male boss. It was humiliating.
thats sad

Well said! Thank you for standing up for nursing moms.
You're awesome! Thank you.
Deflect much?
Agreed
Thank you. We need to show more respect for breastfeeding and to the moms who make this a priority.
Thank you for this!

This is not a right for women This is somebody wanting 15 mins fame over really dumb issue
This is just STUPID I've pumped milk and do not want to do in public cuz it looks dumb plain and simple 2 suction cups on breast
No one's saying to pump in public. Try reading.
TPTB don't want to encourage breastfeeding because it promotes a strong immune system. They just want those children sickened via vaccines.
That would be better than Hillary's Planned Parenthood murdering them, wouldn't it ?
Agree .... have to say I have done this so many times. I just wished it wasn't so.
People don't hence the massive market in baby milk / formulas.
life is tough!  But not quite as tough as a my family having to burn furniture for heat, we ran out of coal, Libs don't know REAL hardships
Because some men have a hard time coming to terms with ever having been on the teet. They can't man up, so to speak. It's disturbing&sad!
Breastfeeding is normal and must be allowed in public. If I eat in public so should my child.
We don't
I feed my baby whenever he is hungry. Don't know why humanity has lost its touch to what make us all mammals.
I was a Lactation Consultant and I heard horror stories about working and trying to pump...
We don't expect mom's to breastfeed in bathroom stalls. Simple as that. Non issue.
so now another special for mothers only room must be added to costs of building? why  does every liberal need so many rooms???
Thank you for being a voice for so many women and children
Bc you liberals are too PC & get trigger with MOM, FEMALES, BOOBS, FEEDING CHILDREN MEN CAN'T
Senator Duckworth, do you know about @MAMAVA ? They create friendly places for women to pump or breastfeed. https://www.mamava.com/mamava-suite/ 
That is an excellent question.
@CortiaH we've talked about this before
Girl yes. That's what I had to do until they let me use the BB office.

That's why we have baby bottles. Quit the griping for heavens sake. I nursed 5 kids without flaunting it
Pretty sure the point is to have an adequate, sanitary, private place to pump milk that will go into a bottle.
Pumping has to be one of the least glamorous and flaunt-worthy aspects of motherhood; at minimum we can ask for a clean place to do it.
I was born this way
Lucky, I wish I were born with Oreo in hand!
No Oreo, but I did have a Cotton cloth Sugar Tit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_tit 
You could probably do it in the prayer room...
Under the federal DOL-FMLA regulations we dont. It requires a private space, specifically not a bathroom...  Just enforce this law.
Thanks for fighting the good fight!
I said this to someone in a restaurant when they suggested I nurse my baby on the toilet. Suggested they eat their dinner there instead
Honest question. What if someone said they didn't want to see nudity in public. What would be your response?
I wasn't nude. Just feeding my baby. I was covered.
Okay, follow up. The act of breast feeding can be argued as an intimate act that nobody wishes to see publicly. What would be your response?
It's a natural act that provides nourishment to an infant. What could be offensive about that? I appreciate the civil discourse
breastfeeding is, in fact, more natural than using a toilet
Tammy most bathrooms aren't fit for their intended purpose I've thought of this many times even though I am now a grandmother! Thank you
#SenDuckworthRules !
An honor to be represented by such strong woman Thank You!
Women must support each other!

Shouldn't be an issue for Congress.  It's a personal matter & choice.  Don't look if Mother Nature offends you!  Ppl stop judging others.
Thank you for speaking up for mothers' rights!
I hope every young woman looks up to you the way my 34 year old self does. ♡♡
Thank you for all you do, Sen. Duckworth. Proud you are one of my Senators.
Real men have opened doors, pulled out chairs & given up seats for ladies for generations...ASHAMED we still  can't get this right! FIX it!!
What are you talking about? California has a law specifically forbidding the toilet  and allows for a special area
Great stuff Senator!  But in this case, I would rather pay taxes/fees instead of taking funds away from air traffic safety 
Great Article Senator Thanks ROS
I always refused to pump or nurse in a bathroom.  My child deserved respect.
Thank you Tammy!
You rock Tammy! Thank you!
*you're
Thank you for advocating for nursing mothers @SenDuckworth
Yes!!! 
I agree. But don't just whip it out.  I could care less where you feed but have some respect for your private time for you and your child.
Do you always eat in "private" If a family are out together should mom and baby leave the rest of the family?
Well like I said I have no problem with it in public. I can say my wife made sure she fed before we went anywhere. Her decision. She felt
Good that your kids ate on your schedule
You go girl!
