why do you people think those are mutually exclusive? Maybe if we weren't footing the bill for a needless wall...
you really don't know the benefits of cultural diversity or supporting humanity? Lemme guess, you're a "christian"?
Jules stop spreading falsehoods. We are all in this together.
a)however many need help b) we welcome them into our communities.
so wrong.  Come #MAGA #MuslimBan #MuslimBanprotest
@chicagotribune STOP TRUMP AND HIS FACIST REGIME!
I agree, and I vote in Illinois. Thanks for using my vote wisely!
And your outrage when obama banned Iraqi refugees in 2011?
I support you Tammy. Please tell us you and @SenatorDurbin are going to take action.
your support of these efforts won't save you. You will be on a list soon enough.
This action is clearly unconstitutional and a religious ban/test against one religion -- totally unacceptable!
Thank you for your courageous service and sacrifice...........and you're STILL serving our country. God bless you Warrior!
Thank you for speaking out against this #muslimban. It is unamerican and wrong.

@Karnythia @chicagotribune Not just unAmerican but illegal under Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965
It's not a Muslim ban, it's a country ban. Which is even worse.
Thank you.
This is my senator, and she’s one of the good ones. Keep it up, @SenDuckworth we’re with you!
Blocking perm US residents&babies entry because of where they're from is not the American way&it doesn't make us safer. #muslimban must end. https://twitter.com/chicagotribune/status/825491856360427520 …

Yes, it IS the American way, until Americans are safe again. Represent YOUR people.  That is our priority.
The Lawful Permanent US Resident being detained at O'Hare *is* one of @SenDuckworth's people. #NoBanNoWall
Thank you for standing up for our constitution and human rights senator!
Totally and respectfully disagree.  It has to begin somewhere.  No other country has open borders
Blocking anyone because of their religion is dangerous. Fight back for us.
@chicagotribune TAMMY FOR PRESIDENT 2020? Please.
Yes.  Not American and unconstitutional. Move to impeach Trump for Emoluments Clause.
what can we do?  How do we help?
Exactly!
Thank you for speaking against #muslimban. #RefugeesWelcome
