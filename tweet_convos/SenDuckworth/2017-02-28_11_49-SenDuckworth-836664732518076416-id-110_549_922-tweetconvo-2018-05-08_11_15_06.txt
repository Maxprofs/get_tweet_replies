…worn our nation’s uniform—including 1000s currently deployed&in danger. For someone who has never served&thinks he knows > Generals… 2/4
…w/real combat experience to say these things is disgusting. It’s yet more evidence President Trump is not fit to be #CommanderInChief. 3/4
let's just all agree that Trump is offensive. Period. And that's not changing anytime soon.
Senator Duckwirth I agree with you. As a working woman I demand equal pay.  I'm very worried at this Pres
This man is a vile human being.
he knows nothing about military or its people
I have never seen a bigger fool then President Trump!!
@SenateDems @TheWeek I didn't see you speaking out much when 2600 were killed under obama in Afghanistan
@Teapublicanways @TheWeek We don't fight to win. There are no objectives to "win" wars. They are designed to be endless.
@kellyfineman @TheWeek The words & mentality of a man who counts victories by the number of dead soldiers
A "tremendous" disservice to men and women in uniform who have defended his freedom for many years. Jerk!
oh and rewriting the rules of engagement to make it so dangerous for them was a service.
Spoken like a true Veteran!!!
Damn right Tammy.  Spoiled, arrogant rich boy who doesn't know what he's talking about.
@SenateDems thank you Sen for speaking. My son is new 19 yr old infantryman. As a military mom I am so angry at DJT.  
shouldn't you be angry at obama for 2600 killed..my nephew is in and your lucky we have Trump.Get informed
you assume I voted for Obama.  I have done a lot of reading. Trump wants to win wars. His ego will cause wars.
Love ya Tammy, keep up the great work!!!
There are no words to describe how disgusting these words from 45 truly are.....so sorry to every person who serves..
all he does is rundown America, it's People, it's Press, and now it's Military.
@100Concerned @TheWeek THANK YOU SENATOR. You are so right!
you go girl.  Thanks for speaking out.  One speech cannot undo years of hatred and months of incompetence.
#45 LYING Draft Dodger.
: THIS MAN WHO DEFERRED SERVic 5 TIMES=SUPPOSED COM.&CHIEF= DISSED US MILITARY? our sons+dghts? SHAME on frail EGO GOP#45
Indeed, Olivia. Indeed. Seems there are way too many people today about whom that can be said.
What was the last war we won? You have a big mouth without mentioning the facts!
She's an Iraq War vet and Purple Heart recipient. The fact is, she fought to win. Why insult her?
Why does she insult the rest of us, the veterans. Trump made a true statement!
And how does a veteran respect a draft dodger like trump in the first place?
That's where you are wrong, it's not about the man, it's about the office. She shows no respect 1/2
for the commander in chief of this nation, that's the disgrace of it all. She forgot something???
You must have respect for the Commander in Chief of the US, regardless of the man in that office.
Respect is earned, he hasn't earned it. Insulting military personnel doesn't earn it.
He's out of his mind to say something like that when he has no clue what it means to fight for our country!
not truthful is a soft DEM turn. He is a LIAR!
@SenateDems @TheWeek please do not pretend to speak for all Americans, most disagree with u,
Dear Senator Duckworth, Please continue to speak out against Trump's lies, false promises, and exaggerations. Thank you!!!
Offensive is 100% correct. I wonder if his feet still bother him.
@SenateDems @TheWeek Agree 100%. Would elect you Pres in a heartbeat!
this man has led a life of shame and demeans those who defend the nation he has taken so much from
Typical out of context crap from the left. Trump is right! Obama gave soldiers strict rules of engagement.
What is Trump right about? I would love to know.
This is reprehensible. Thank you @SenDuckworth for your service to our country and for representing IL. We are very fortunate to have you.
@SenateDems @TheWeek The TWIT In Chief never served, and has the audacity to insult veterans and active duty. Resign and MAGA.
I'm sorry,how many deferments did he get 2 avoid duty?I've ZERO respect for 1 who belittles sacrifices of our ppl.
@MaryQueenfspots @TheWeek he wouldn't know that he's a serial dodger
Spoken from the mouth of someone who didn't serve..dodged the #Vietnam #Military draft..insulted #POW. #NERVE
@Pie_SocialMedia @TheWeek Truth be told they fight to stay alive.
Please kick Trump in the balls the next time you see him, Senator. And make sure someone records it
@wlg_ord @TheWeek the devil is our president. God help us!
@SenateDems @TheWeek Impeach and replace.  Stop the madness
@SenateDems @TheWeek What a slap in the face to all brave men & women who stand for our country! Trump = national disgrace!!
you will never be considered a deserving #CommanderInChief and will never be able to earn my respect (2) @SenDuckworth
or the respect of the other 74+ million that did not vote for you. Your presidency is an embarrassment @SenDuckworth
Thank you Tammy for your service your Commitment to your Senate OATH-all GOP  has denied Defending US Constitution
thank you for your service. I stand with you. I served during Vietnam. @POTUS is shameful,bigot but don't let him distract you
Why did you vote for confirmation of Wilbur Ross?  Please explain.  Thanks.
@SenateDems @TheWeek where should I return my service medal since I was a part of the Vietnam losers?
@SenateDems @TheWeek our Commander in Chief...
Mr.T shows no respect for Americans or America
@SenateDems @TheWeek It's a disgrace that he is the Commander in Chief. He's a draft dodger and a narcissistic con-man.
The man is not fit to be called Commander-in-Chief! He is dangerous & an abomination. Somehow he must be removed from office!
When he gripes that "we don't win wars anymore," it sounds as though his awareness of international events was...
...formed and then frozen in the late 1970's, when America was still dazed after not winning in Vietnam. His...
...conception of domestic & economic issues also seems stuck in 1979 when he yaps about "inner cities" & "imports."
If it weren't for bone spurs, @realDonaldTrump would've become the 1st 6-star general & marched the U.S. to victory. #Sad
omg what a thing for trump to say, a man who hid during the vietnam war...shame on him
Shame on you for not knowing the difference between disqualifying and disability. So how did he "hide"?
HOOAH 
@SenateDems @TheWeek How in hell does the Republican Party support this idiot?
And what's incorrect? Are you saying politicians don't cause battles over won turf?
@SenateDems @TheWeek reality: we lost Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan at a cost of lives and limbs. Why? PC Fight to win
He is such an idiot and truly has no clue what he's talking about. #notmypresident #resist
@SenateDems @TheWeek His existence in the news has for many years been an embarrassment to this country. Never understood it.
ma'am @POTUS #Trump forgets that he is the #CINC and disrespecting his troops denotes poor leadership
He also piled blame for Yemen on "them." Pretty shameful.

@SenDuckworth @TheWeek

how about you stop voting for his nominees!
DEMS lost 2016
so as they say SEN floor PLEASE SIT DOWN no power, do the will of the President US people that put him in
more fake news intentionally misrepresenting his words. Yawn.
@KilttripUSA @TheWeek @POTUS where were you during your 4 DEFERMENTS. Easy to spew bull shit at what you chickened out of!
thank you for serving our country Senator! Aloha!
@SenateDems @TheWeek :How can #GOP keep letting the vile sewage come out of this man's mouth? Truly a disgrace to the country
@SenateDems @TheWeek this communist that we call our president needs to be impeached he's about as un American as you can get.
It worked for Slick Willie
He spoke the truth!! Try and TELL ME otherwise!!! I have been there, done that!!!
So has she, and she fought to win.
Oh that's right they fight to die. This coming from a man who didn't even serve.
where was he during hi 4 draft deferments???  Losa!
Hanging out with Bill Clinton
@SenateDems @TheWeek he displayed his understanding of veterans when he accepted a Purple Heart from one. No leader.
thank you for your service and your voice. I'm disgusted and appalled more than I was already, and that's a lot.
#LIAR President Trump is the most honest honorable President ever. #MAGA
@SenateDems @TheWeek  What do you expect from a draft dodging , yellow rich kid with no brain !
he wasn't even a presence of good after 9/11-everyone stepped up how we could+he was Billy Zane in "Titanic."
@SenateDems @TheWeek Thank you for your service and sacrifice Senator.
Thanks for your service and your continued fight for our country's true values
is his idea of"winning"demoralizing and depleting?He has no honor or courage,only flatters groups for his benefit.
The man is a joke. Don't even give him the credit of listening to his blather. He stole the election. Let's prove it!
He's a disgrace! Our so-called commander in chief!
Absolutely. I am just shocked & saddened to hear his remarks.
@mesosuchus @TheWeek hey he knows pain. He had bone spurs or something.
It was so bad, and it stank of ointment. #NeverForgetBoneSpurs
I hope you run to unseat him.
that would be awesome
tRump, another chicken hawk!
