@RepCheri @JuliaBrownley26 What you really mean: "More $ to unions! More $ to rich Democrat donors!"
@RepCheri  Picture was fine until you added "House Democrats want to put Americans back to work" should read "Americans want ...back to work
@RepCheri good idea, why aren't we doing that since the President had been asking for it for at least four years
@RepCheri  it seems to me you forget about education, let's stop cheating in the people for better education. passed  law for no saggy pants
@RepCheri There's no $ left for infrastructure (a legit govt function) because the dems have spent us into the poorhouse buying votes.
Rods and bridges are the last thing we need. Use your brain. @RepCheri @TiFLiS_BiTLiS
@RepCheri @RepPaulTonko Still Tweeting about #MiddleClassFirst yet you drive a $50k Lincoln, have custom tailored suits & never hd a pvt job
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi You are so yesterday! You have said that so many times!You did nothing when you had control&still are doing nothing!
@RepCheri @RepSteveIsrael  Keystone
@RepCheri Better jobs start with regulations not interfering with job creation. We need to scarp most of the regulations that impede busines
@TiFLiS_BiTLiS @RepCheri that's because most defense jobs are and make money to support bigger concessions in trade negotiations.
@RepCheri @HouseDemocrats wake up
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi Don't forget the coal miners.
@RepCheri @rosadelauro you forgot BIGGER TAXES to pay for it all
@RepCheri better pay for company truck drivers
@RepCheri
@RepCheri @rosadelauro Yes we need infrastructure but we also need to float the debt it will be built on.  Find a reasonable finance method.
@RepCheri @RepBeatty  it will happen after our JV President is out of office
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi agree and lets start with KEYSTONE. JOBs plus OPEC OIL Independence. A great deal.  OK KEYSTONE!!! Gald DEMs agree,
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi here's how Dems govern...http://www.wsj.com/articles/pelosis-netanyahu-complaint-1425513592 …
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi Remember when we tried this last time? All temporary jobs
@RepCheri -- #JUSTSAYN Nance old girl!
@RepCheri Your call 4 jobs & bigger pay checks would B valid if it weren't for your infamous Obamacare chopping full-time jobs to part-time.
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi Hey!!! Wait a minute! You want $$'s for infrastructure & bridges! Won't that put more cars on roads creating smog?
@RepCheri @HouseDemocrats I am so embarrassed to have you guys in my government
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi No that is not true, already did that 6 yrs back and still nothing. Roads and bridges only for illegals to work
@RepCheri @HouseDemocrats   Majority Party'ers will address infrastructure after Hilary email hearings, about 2016.
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi   Go suck a blue egg!! Tired of all the BS lies!!
@AztlanConnect @RepCheri @RepRoybalAllard agreed
@RepCheri @HouseDemocrats MUST create STRICT labor laws requiring employers see 3 forms of ID before hiring.Right to Work states especially
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi are you not the party that said Keystone will only create temp. jobs? Isn't construction temp. jobs?
@RepCheri @kharyp If Globalization structure neutered&all of influence&power called2account stringent enforceable penalties4 deceit & lies
@RepCheri better use of our money than more military excursions!
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi Oh, you're going with #ShovelReady again?!? #Imbecile
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi Great idea.  Is that a new proposition or merely an oft repeated talking point?  Where's the beef?
@RepCheri @RepDuckworth Or a Pipe Line
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi I thought infrastructure was a big reason for Obama's stimulus.  Remember "shovel-ready" jobs?

What happened?
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi But not pipelines...roads, bridges, yes. But not pipelines. Pipelines are bad huh? Wasn't stimulus to pay for this?
@RepCheri you and your president stopped keystone pipeline and you have the nerve to talk about jobs b.s.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi When your actions are inconsistent with your words, I must conclude that you lie.
@RepCheri @janschakowsky Bustos most recent votes do not demonstrate she is for the middle class.
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi These jobs are less in time b/c they're over when completed KXL WILL CONTINUE UNTIL THERE'S NO MORE OIL
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi gotta love Dems...dusting off old political slogans...but when in power 2yrs...did nothing but harm Middle-class
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi The pipeline would have meant a road to energy independence from Iran, Venz, etc. Refinery jobs,cleaner than rail
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi I'm sure she wants 2 raise the gas tax 2 do this. We already fell 4 shovel ready jobs once. Where is all that $$?
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi didn't the Dems do a stimulus in 2009 for infrastructure? $1 trillion? Shovel ready? It never happened. Now want more
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi How much taxes do we need to pay to fix our roads, how bout get Obama to sign the Keystone bill. Instant jobs.
@RepCheri  The American Jobs Act President Obama proposed last time and College 2years free and get struggling folks to testify to congress
@RepCheri Yes!
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi More shovel ready jobs?.....Hmmmm
@RepCheri  bring back Glass Eagle make banks and Wall street play by rules of old not gambling with other struggling folks $
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi Hey Nancy, will @HillaryClinton share her clues with min wage workers how to make $300 Thousand per hour emailing?
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi Include Keystone XL in there and you might get GOP support.
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi Our road gets rebuilt every freakin year, by the same road crews, who spend most of their time standing around #waste
@RepCheri 
What a Concept!!!
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi But building a pipeline is wrong?
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi you must really think we're all freaking brain dead!
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi yeah what pipeline Obama vetoed there's some jobs and why haven't you done anything 6years
@NanbumHall @RepCheri @NancyPelosi no real jobs and no benefit to America so why?
Democrat @RepCheri promises "bigger paychecks", but we're in
the longest streak of SUB-60% Employment since JAN 1979!
http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS12300000&from_year=1977&to_year=2015 …
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi we did this already remember?! Obama and his "shovel ready jobs"! What a freaking joke!
@MrMeatnuggets @RepCheri @NancyPelosi whys that? The joke was the GOP defunding all the projects, well except for Texas
@Michbassclub @MrMeatnuggets @RepCheri @NancyPelosi  the stimulus in 2009 when GOP minority....Dems passed an almost $1trillion infrastruct
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi We dan't do these things if Obama is funneling the tax dollars to his base.
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi Now that is an insult to thinking Americans.
@RepCheri @NancyPelosi White Amorus vs Desecration Negro In World Apropriation 1873-2173
@repcheri @nancypelosi wait if the pipeline doesn't make sense because it only creates temporary jobs isnt same true for bridges and roads??
@tobokie @RepCheri @NancyPelosi lmao but these have an actual benefit to America
@michbassclub @repcheri @nancypelosi i don't know encouraging the use of autos building roads on open land, bridges interfering w/ wetlands
@tobokie @RepCheri @NancyPelosi ... Seriously ... You're kidding right?
@michbassclub @repcheri @nancypelosi no how is the delivery of hydrocarbons wrong but the use and the creation of greenhouse gasses ok…
@tobokie @RepCheri @NancyPelosi you aren't making any sense.
@michbassclub @repcheri @nancypelosi why if harm from hydrocarbons is wrong we shouldn't do anything that assists like creating roads
