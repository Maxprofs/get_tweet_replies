Senate Democrats call for probe of Trump administration's refusal to obey court orders http://huff.to/2k7gExk  
.@SenDuckworth Thank you for this. But will you commit to voting NO on future Trump cabinet nominees?
and what does voting NAY do when the GOP has the votes?
It's a start. It's a symbol of resistance, if nothing else. It says Dems won't be complicit.
Unfortunately people elected Republicans. Dems need to pick their battles.. Otherwise, bye fillibuster, bye enviro Regs.
You can believe whatever you want, but any Senator of mine that confirms Trump’s candidates loses my support.
No need to argue :) I just think its importnt not to throw the baby out with the bath... No Senator has voted no on all.
I hear you. Some, like Mattis, seem like a decent choice out of terrible options. Still, it's worth making a stand.
I’m fine with Mattis. I understand Mattis. Duckworth supported Kelly.
how far you want to dig?

@HuffPostPol..America has just voted a dictator simple
Thank you! #resist
Thank you for taking swift action!
proud to be represented by you and @SenatorDurbin - on the right side of history!
Wow, where was such entusiasm to probe for POTUS refusal to obey court orders when Obama was POTUS...#EPA. Such hypocrisy.
Let's talk about how you co-sponsored HR 158 for Obama but freak when @POTUS @realDonaldTrump uses it http://tinyurl.com/z5l6mon 
@HuffPostPol even obama wanted the courts to have no say over the WH we didn't elected the court we elected him to do the job!
@SenateDems by the time you organize your #investigation you will be out of the picture this is #coup! Do something with a bit more umph
@HuffPostPol it's all intentional edicts& solicitations to compel mayhem with larger plans within disruption going unnoticed
@HuffPostPol Dems should ALL have voted NO on Kelly. Millions ate watching all of you
@SenatorDurbin Thank you!
@HuffPostPol keep up the excellent work! As an IL voter, I am proud we Elected you
Thank you.  Keep on it!  Tried to call your office, but can't get through.  I support what you and @SenatorDurbin are doing.
Thank you, Senator, for representing Illinois in this fight against hatred.
@HuffPostPol calling for something is easy. Let's see people stand up against nominations &c.
Please vote against Sessions. Illinois is watching and wanting you to represent.
This Army veteran thanks you ma'am!
thank you!
@HuffPostPol Thank you!! #resist
TAMMY - CHANGE YOUR NAME
@reese_malmgren @HuffPostPol about time! He is NOT a King, this is America, he works for us now.
@HuffPostPol nothing trumps doing is illegal. Judges can't overturn a executive order unless it's criminal. Act educated
Stop confirming anything Trumpian, fight for us.
thank you Tammy
@SenatorDurbin thanks for leading this. Will you commit to voting NO on all future appointees?
@HuffPostPol THANK YOU!
please continue to lead and be strong. We need you now more then ever. #trumpismisnotnormal
@HuffPostPol Thank you, Hon.Tammy Duckworth!
@chemoelectric @HuffPostPol don't forget Russian
@HuffPostPol @Cgriffin3323 Joe jealous AF right now @WalshFreedom
I'm sure he gets these feeds
can we look into this also? No? Just checking that short term American woman brain ugh.....
I was so happy to vote for you, now please, VOTE NO on Trump's cabinet!
screw the fact 221 million left with our last pres. Against the house vote. America is in a total state of hypocrisy! The end
Go Tammy!!
thank you
@browntk56 Senator Duckworth, did you see that http://whitehouse.gov  website now omits "Judicial Branch" under "Government"?
@HuffPostPol and vote No! to pruitt!!! Please!!! 
You should block all business in the Senate until these actions are completely reversed and the EO is overturned.
Thank you for your leadership.
@MSignorile @HuffPostPol senate do not vote to confirm anyone! DO THAT!
a PROBE? You really need to stand up to Trump forcefully, otherwise you risk becoming irrelevant #MuslimBan
How about contempt for CBP people obstructing ???
Thank you!
@mattdpearce @HuffPostPol Thank you.
Go Senator Duckworth, go!  :-)
We have your back.
Thankful that things are being done behind the relative silence.  You came into worst administration ever. Don't lose resolve
@MSignorile @HuffPostPol Great, this needs to be investigated immediately.
@mattdpearce @HuffPostPol that's great, in mean time, can we have a presser, maybe bring the judges and announce the reality??
Thank you. Keep it up.
@mattdpearce YES GOOD THANK YOU
Thanks. Now don’t confirm Sessions or others —esp Sessions and Price @SenDuckworth @deborahblum
@HuffPostPol Resist Trump and Bannon anywhere and everywhere
@HuffPostPol Go Tammy!!!
Thank you for this, although it is all bad, the refusal is one of the more troubling aspects.
Have you seen this? https://twitter.com/JessikaJayne/status/825622046453424129/video/1 …
I am an illinoian married to service member living out of state. So proud. Keep fighting. Never give up. We are with you.
Keep fighting the good fight on behalf of all humans! Thank you for voting in humanity's interests.
@HuffPostPol need 2 clean house at @CustomsBorder. Failure 2 obey court order = fired & jailed 4 contempt! #travelban #Standup
why did you vote to confirm Mattis and Kelly? Please set a better example and quit supporting Trump and his cronies.
bcause they are not trumpistas & are the only 2 who can prevent our slide into a dictatorship
please obstruct as often as possible. Thank you and hope to see you in Elgin sometime soon.
@HuffPostPol Duckworth for President 2020 
but will you withhold consent requiring cloture, tie Senate in knots, resist until removal of Trump?
@HuffPostPol ALL Members of congress should be doing this not just democrats
great to see action being taken
#NoBanNoWall stand up and help America?  United we StandDivided we Fall time is now! #StopPresidentBannon #Freedom #ladylibertyweeps
Can you ask why the Judicial Branch has been removed from http://Whitehouse.gov  while you're at it?
thank you
@HuffPostPol Thank you. We need more people in congress to stand up.
Thank you @SenDuckworth and @SenatorDurbin . Please continue to push by voting no on rest of cabinet appointments
@SenatorDurbin Thank you for this! I remember Watergate too well. CBP agents' defiance of court orders is seriously scary.
we're counting on you to be part of #theresistance. Please don't let us down.
Thanks for doing something, Senator.
and here I was asking where you and @SenatorDurbin were. Keep fighting @realDonaldTrump.
Sen. Duckworth, were you aware that the Judicial Branch has been removed from the White House website?
Senator, please, no one can leave elected reps' messages when voicemail boxes are constantly full. #CallYourSenators
@HuffPostPol Thank you.
@HuffPostPol thank you!
