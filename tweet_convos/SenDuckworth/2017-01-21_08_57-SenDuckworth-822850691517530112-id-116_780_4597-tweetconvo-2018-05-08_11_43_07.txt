so proud of my senator!
You are a #Hero! It is an insult to our armed forces to have a Commander in Chief who mocked #Veterans & Prisoners of war!
And, who dodged the draft numerous times, while men with less money and influence fought and died.
why?
Because this is why:
On taxpayer ? Was that a proud moment? Standing up there with libs spewing profanities further dividing this country? 
DId you attend the Right to Life march this weekend? You are the senator for all of the people in Illinois. Right?
thank you! Proud to have you as my new Senator!
Thank you for representing us here in Illinois and for rocking that jacket.  Iconic.
Thank you so much!
I love you! Never stop being nasty! #womensmarch #solidarity
