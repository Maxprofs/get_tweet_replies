SERIOUSLY @SenDuckworth @SenSchumer??? We ALL saw those leaked democRAT emails floating around! You people are vile! #headclown #MAGA #Trump
He has not shown that he will defend and uphold civil rights for all.  Please oppose Sessions.
please vote no on Sessions.  Trust your concerns.
@SenSchumer @HuffPostPol #fakenews
@SenSchumer @HuffPostPol and what exactly is on record that you are looking at
NO NO NO NO NO NO TO SESSIONS.
He stated he was involved in civil rights cases that he wasn't really involved in. Why inflate your record?
Please do not confirm this man Tammy
I was very proud when you were elected as Senator. Please do not allow that man to be Attorney General.
he deserves as Fair of a hearing as he gave to those people he discriminated against
Thank you Senator Duckworth  You are a true American Hero.  I hope you boycott this inauguration. Thank you.
@ammboston @HuffPostPol Just vote NO for Sessions.We will all b doomed if confirmed.
@SenSchumer @HuffPostPol Another unhinged liberal making shit up!
Assure us you will vote a resounding NO on Sessions. He seeks to amplify the hate, fear, ignorance and divisiveness of the exec orders.
I voted for you.  Do you plan on attending the inauguration???
he helped desegregate alabama schools.
he got death penalty for KKK member who killed black

id say thats pretty damn good
Please vote NO on Jeff Sessions based his rascist comments & civil rts record. I'm a constituent. My zip code is 60614. Thx
The photo you sent shows PBO shedding tears for the children of Sandy Hook. .....We'll all be crying soon.
I am an Illinois resident. I agree with you. Please vote NO to confirm  thank you.
Another Trump deplorable!
Merrick Garland deserved a fair hearing and never got it.  I expect more activism from you, Senator Duckworth.
Thanks Sen Duckworth!
We voted you out. We don't care what you think. Session is next AG :P :p :P ;p
The last thing we need is another racist at the top of the tree! #ILiswatching
@SenSchumer Your party Changed the Senate rules now live with it. The people demand an up and down vote today.
@SenSchumer @HuffPostPol Complete nonsense. Democrats have nothing but name calling as a strategy.
partisan bullshit . This is what were going to get for 6 years huh
He deserves a fair hearing that ends in him not being confirmed.
you're my hero! No b*llsh*t!
@SenSchumer @HuffPostPol please stop his confirmation. Surely there are GOP members who feel the same.
His record is fine. You are a drama queen from a loony liberal state.
@gracelandali @HuffPostPol The fact that he was rejected for the U.S. district court in 87' should be a red flag!!
@SenSchumer @HuffPostPol he just had kkk members protesting HIM. Which is it?
@SenSchumer @HuffPostPol ur a complete idiot, he prosecuted the head of the kkk, what more do u want?
Time to vet you! This is an absolute disgrace what you are doing to these candidates! Former Dem who will NEVER RET. TO PARTY!
As you should be. Please address our concerns accordingly. Thank you for your service.
@SenSchumer @HuffPostPol gag I want to vomit
@SenSchumer @HuffPostPol 

Your protest is purely political.
@SenSchumer @HuffPostPol God I love her!!!! 
As your constituent, I urge you to vote no on Senator Sessions. Thank you.
@SenSchumer Will there be any witnesses to this process?
Greetings from Michigan and thanks for the fight, Senator! So glad you have arrived in the Senate.
Sessions has a horrible record re civil rights &disability rights. He is an unqualified bigot Please vote NO & #stopsessions!
So incredibly proud to have you for my IL senator.  Thank you!!
And Senators conducting confirmations deserve the OGE report on the nominee to be fully informed.
@SenSchumer @HuffPostPol not that we need DNC approval for anything now. SCOTUS next!
Please do the right thing and vote against Session's nomination. #StopSessions #StopHate
@SenSchumer @HuffPostPol He's had an entire career of racist, anti LGBT, pro-torture,anti healthcare votes. That's who he is
please stand up for your constituents and vote against sessions' appointment. We need to move forward, not backwards
Sessions is too close to Trump, too uninformed, against civil, voter & women's rights. He is not qualified for AG
A fair hearing would clearly spell out his nearly four decade long career of racism, homophobia and misogyny.
really cause we are more concerned with Police officers being murdered
as a constituent I am asking and insisting that you reject Sessions for any executive position.
Vote NO!
It might be pointless but with the Rep majority, but please vote against him.
Fair hearing doesn't have to mean a "yes vote"  #StopSessions Fight this. Please.
Thanks? weird meme dude.  try something else.
Illinois resident here. Thank you for standing strong and voicing our concerns about his record and history!
@akmk @HuffPostPol I would agree...except does one deserve a "fair" hearing when he/she hasn't been vetted?
He should be interrogated by his peers, the #AA community. After all, we're all equal under the law, right?
As my senator as ask you vote NO. Thank you.
You should probably educate yourself on his actual record. Civil rights advocate, a good man with integrity.
Thank you for your thoughtful review of his record. As an IL voter, I hope you will vote no on his confirmation.
please work to keep Sessions from being confirmed. Thank you for your service!
I believe fairness works both ways, he needs to submit all appropriate documentation and pass all background checks to be fairly considered.
Don't worried @SenTedCruz asked if he would be as Blatantly Partisan as the last 2 AG's and he firmly said NO
How can we believe anything he says given what he's said in the past? Yes, some folks do "evolve" but I can't believe it here.
Please don't rubber stamp these people. Sessions is completely unqualified for this position.
no no no
I will be unbelievably disappointed if you vote to confirm him. #StopSessions
Vote NO on Sessions please.
Is bearing false witness all Dems know how to do?
Fair enough.  This is his toughest job interview.
We are watching in IL. Oppose this nomination. Sessions has no place in today's DOJ.
Thank you Senator! We have to move forward not backward!
I'm not sure how I feel about him...but I remain confident he will get a fair shake from YOU regardless.
Hoping you'll vote no, Senator!!
Thank you for fighting for us!!!
