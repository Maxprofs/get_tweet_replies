Millions of veterans could be ineligible to receive tax credits under the Republican healthcare plan http://washex.am/2mUcc5D  
POTUS & his GOP allies are putting Veterans on the chopping block to jam through a misguided, harmful repeal. They should be ashamed 2/2
Sen. Duckworth, when are you going to have the same medical plan as the people you represent.
When are ANY senators going to have the same plans as their constituents? I want Paul Ryan's plan!
This is a tax cut to the rich, not healthcare.
@POTUS is already lower than pond scum so your comment is really saying something. #Liar #Fraud #Groper #Peeper #Bigot #MSNBC
@SenSchumer you're full of it. It's the Democrats that don't give a darn about the vets.
@SenSchumer Democrats lost.  It's over.  TRUMP IS PRESIDENT.  AMERICA FIRST. IT'S NOT ABOUT PARTY.
Thank you for pointing out. @GOP #senators & #congress talk big but do not deliver to Vets. #Trumpcare #EpicFail
but they certainly campaigned on our backs.
they did. Vet friends think @GOP will be there. Wrong. Better attention from @POTUS44. #Truth
@SenSchumer the most important thing to the Democrats is the illegal immigrants. They are ruining our country. Americans first
@SenSchumer 8 years is enough.  NO help for  VETERANS.  WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
Aren't veterans automatically covered under the VA?
nope
@katpowell67 if u are surprised by this...wtf have u been the last few months?
Fake news!!!
@SamScrogg 
@SenSchumer I agree the new GOP plan must not pass.
How heartless!  We know that Trump lies all the time.  He needs to be impeached!
Yet DJT claims to support our veterans?
Thank you Senator
And they go pretty low!
You notice no one mentions Max Catastrophic ceilings in this GOP bill,goes hand&hand with preexisting,=important
He PROMISED during the campaign to take care of our veterans!!  How can this be happening?? A true nightmare for so many deserving vets.
Especially since he received a high percentage of their vote, yet now Vets have to go thru omerosa to speak with donald.
Thank you for opposing the AHCA.
@RepKinzinger throws millions of Vets under the bus. Wouldn't want to be in a foxhole with that guy! @SenDuckworth @abcnews @cnn #il14
@iriedeby1 wow, that is saying a lot.
It just shows that the GOP has not thought this plan they've had 7 yrs to develop, through!
one more reason..and a HUGE one, to hate this horrible plan
AND a new low for @SpeakerRyan and @SecPriceMD. Not @SenateMajLdr though, he's done plenty of dirt at this level
@SenSchumer Obama was in for 8 years!  Why didn't he do something? !
As a constituent of Illinois, I stand against the repeal of the ACA.
@SenSchumer I thought that's what your long VA wait times were for ,!
Keep up the good work.
@votevets trump has never cared about the vets. But his lip service got him a job. This country is basically doomed thanks GOP
@SenSchumer I swear to god Trump doesn't care about anyone but the 1 %
@OrangeRugRat There were many "Trumper" Veterans out during the campaign that thought somehow speaking for "ALL" vets, was ok!
they weren't speaking for me.
the plan will be cut to give the richest more tax breaks!
senators have called your office, faxed you letters now twitter. Please stand up for us all! Tell Trump is plan is wrong.
@joepete104 Trump only cares about Trump
@SenSchumer @dcexaminer No,that's par for the course. (Get it? Cuz he golfs every weekend in FL)
Its the crappy VA system of Obama term that had Vets dying wait to just see a doctor, so no care at all from Dems
@SesameTweet3 It gives Citizens a Voucher to buy Healthcare including Ppl who have Medicare. Here's your $2k Voucher Good Luck
@SenSchumer Fake News.
#Trump will never lookout for anyone but himself. He is acting like the CEO of the USA. He signed up for the wrong job.
@SenSchumer 
More homeless veterans under DICKtator obama who wouldn't even salute our military.
They have already been suffering under Obama, how many of them died waiting !!!
@SenSchumer Did either of you read the article? Trump hasn't signed anything yet & had nothing to do with this mistake!
@SenSchumer  
 Damn Traitor draft dodger
What a deplorable thing 2 do to our Vets.
no #Trumpcare the emergency room is not a viable health care plan! Putting vets and elderly poor at risk is unacceptable!
There R veterans that support trump and there R veterans that don't,but veterans ALWAYS support veterans & we vote!
@SenSchumer Veterans like myself have the VA benefit. Trump is NOT hurting me at all.
@SenSchumer HE PROMISED OUR VETERANS AN END TO THEIR TRAVAILS AND THE BEST CARE EVER! LIAR, LIAR, LIAR!
@SenSchumer the only new low is listening to drugging of democrats feet posing their looking out for the people -thats a low
@SenSchumer HE PROMISEF COVERAGE FOR EVERYONE AT A FRACTION OF THE COST OF OBAMACARE! HE PROMISED TO WATCH OUT FOR OUR VETRRAN
@SenSchumer Liars
@sahlee426 Not a new low. How can we be surprised by anything he does.
@SenSchumer, to be corrected in the House Rules Committee or on the floor. TRUMP! "absolutely unacceptable" read your post!
@SenSchumer is this how @GOP @POTUS support the troops? #norepeal #republicanlipservice #NoOnRyancare #RESIST #Trumpcare
Trump increased military spending. Yes, he is taking care of the troops.
increasing $ for defense doesn't mean an increase of benefits for the troops.
He's yet again conned American people. This callous treatment of vets is shameful. Paul Ryan has hitched his wagon
Doesn't everyone know by now, Trumpster fire doesn't care about anybody but himself?
@SenSchumer winning is what matters to Trump not good healthcare for those in need.
The bar is so lo...ah, just chuck that thing and paint a stripe on the ground already.
@SenSchumer just give everyone the same health care Congress gets for the same Congress pays. & Pay congress minimum wage.
@SenSchumer What are your plans to fix healthcare. Pandering and inflammatory statements do not help.
@SenSchumer
@SenSchumer @DevinNunes @SenateMajLdr  Devin something else for you today don't let House reps vote yes on this.
It's disgusting and unconscionable
@SenSchumer that's sad @SpeakerRyan @latinorebels @elizabethforma @maddow @Oprah @TheEllenShow @AC360 @Lawrence @BarackObama
I NEVER EXPECTED ANY LESS FROM THIS FAKE 45 POTUS!
@SenSchumer @dcexaminer how low can he go? Start impeachment investigation on emoluments and lies now
Where were you when they were dying in the parking lot of VA hospitals under Obama hypocrite?
Please explain.
I say let's let obama Care emplode leach g all without care. I'm willing to give up lower taxes for that.
@SenSchumer @dcexaminer There is no low for Trump.....he'll do anything for attention.
@SenSchumer uncaring and evil!
@SenSchumer how is this happening with a PRESIDENT INFER FBI INVESTIGATION .... billshit!!!!
@SenSchumer he has no clue what damage this would do. Or, he doesn't care. Ryan is full of b.s.
@SenSchumer Many lows to date, many more to come, thank you Senators, for speaking out, standing up!
@SenSchumer you know for fact that is not true you just don't want Obamas legacy gone you gonna cry more tears
@SenSchumer yes the veterans, those over 50 and the poor!  Who benefits? The rich!
.@realDonaldTrump  @SenDuckworth @votevets
@votevets It's all been the lowest common denominator up to this point #ImpeachTrump #TrumpRussiaCollusion
@votevets terrible despicable
@justdreamin91 The #Trump tax cut for the wealthy 2% is disguised as a health care bill. It is not. Leave #ACA , it works.
Thank you for your support of Veteran's issues, especially healthcare.
Have you seen or read the bill? Where are you getting your info besides "news outlets"? Just wondering
Say No & fight for our BELOVED Veterans and Active Duty Service Members
But, millions of Veteran's voted for him. They all got duped.
For years, some of us got fed SHT by them and we called it FUDGE. Next decade, we'll be doing it again. Typical.
pushing a plan that makes it harder 4 people on a fixed income to get care is deplorable. Retirement should be a reward.
#TrumpCon
more lies here is what @realDonaldTrump said
Attending a great listening session with @DeptVetAffairs @SecShulkin in the Roosevelt Room. We are going to take care of our VETS! #Heroes 
@DeptVetAffairs @SecShulkin he says one thing and does another. They plan to privatize the VA. We are screwed
in the words of our juvenile leader....Sad!
