Thank you Senator!
Thank you! Stand tuff!  Dems have to stick together or we have no party!
No Pruitt or He Will Ruin It #SaveEPA
Thank you for speaking out against this nomination and the threat to our environment that it represents.
This Illinoisan is disappointed in you. Sorry we elected a Partisan. The EPA is out of control.  Pruitt needed.
Thank you Senator Duckworth! We cannot continue to deny the human impact on climate change. We need action now!
YOU have fallen short from the day you were bought in Crook County. #YouAreNotMySenator

Good job Tammy! The majority of Illinoisans back you for this. Now vote no for Gorsuch. #OpposeGorsuch #resist

@SenatorDurbin Your message needs to be clear, not obstructing!, but planning to oppose really bad cabinet picks.
so glad I don't have to call your office about basic stuff like this
Thank you! No to Norsuch, DeVos. Do what you can to block nominations #resist
