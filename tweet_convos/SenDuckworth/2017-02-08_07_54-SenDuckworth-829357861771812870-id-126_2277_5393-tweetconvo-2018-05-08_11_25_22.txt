'Nevertheless, she persisted.' In silencing of @SenWarren, a new feminist rally cry is born http://fw.to/OD2YKpe  
@HeidiStevens13 @SenWarren a losing cry
Tammy! You inspire me every day!

Proud to call you my senator!
@LaurieWJN I was proud Donor #49 to "Ready for Warren." Where were the rest of you last year???

@VotesCa @HeidiStevens13 @SenWarren I already know one person who got it tattooed today! I'm going next Tuesday.
Thank you!!!

I’m so grateful that you did. Having you be my voice in Washington is something very important to me. THANK YOU! #ShePersisted
lie lie lie, she will be gone in 2018
*2023 
6 years for senators, sir. @SenDuckworth
I'm talking about Warren
oh, sorry. It will be a very interesting race depending on who the Republicans run. You’re correct that it’s not a lock.
@CherryTheTart @HeidiStevens13 @SenWarren #TheFutureisFemale 

Elizabeth Warren for Prez 2020!!!

Go get him @SenDuckworth. We have your back. And there are tens of millions of us.

@sengraham2016 @SenateMajLdr You have unleashed the fury of women & feminists. We will defeat you & win! #TheResistance
Thank you for your continued service to our country! #persist  #resist We are all glad you're here today making a difference!
THank you
Thank you for your service and your grit! #NeverthelessShePersisted
has nothing to do with that crazy thing. Many have had strife, persisted to do better. She just wouldn't follow the rules
@markos Duck, you need to switch parties. Libtards don't deserve you!
he handed us a battlecry a quote that will live in infamy. 17 will b the yr women gear up 2run '18. As always TY 4 ur service
we fight
thank you for your courage and inspiration
fight on, senator
Thank you for your service and sacrifice you continue to do for our country!
a new mean bitch was born today
@SenWarren if we don't see a Duckworth/Warren ticket next election cycle I'm done
@metaquest Standing with the Blur! We have to fight to get back the red & white from these Nazi Deplorable's! #ShePersists #
@HeidiStevens13 @SenWarren if it were the other way around you would have done the same thing. Hypocrisy 101. Rules r rules.
@rweingarten #LizShutUp #LizMitchSlapped #LIBERALTEARS #LizSitDown
Thank you Senator Duckworth!
Thank you for your leadership and your example
Yet another loser Democrat who didn't actually watch the speech! Keep making asses of yourselves based on another LIE.
@Oliviafoxradio Where is the support for @MaxineWaters who was booed by the senate?
He doesn't care about his hypocrisy, Sen. Duckworth. He just cares about exercising absolute power for GOP rule.
a woman persists & she gets sat down; a man persists & crickets.
Yep!
@Bibmomma3 #ShePersisted and revealed @SenateMajLdr is a hypocritical liar!!
rule 19 is archaic. throw it out.
thank you for your persistence. You are a representative that I trust!
Thank you. So grateful to have your voice in the Senate. So proud you represent our state.
Entire #GOP appears to have taken a giant leap away from common sense.  And decorum.
You deserve the praise. Warren, OTOH, merely violated Senate rules.
What are you talking about?
thanks for sticking up for us! Keep fighting the good fight! #IVote
Did you break the rules to get where you are? Cause that's what she did, right?
The GOP did the world a favor. America is tired of the constant rumbling of lies spewing from dem Senators. Take a vacation.
@Bibmomma3 @HeidiStevens13 @SenWarren do you think they care about much besides their own agenda?
@SenWarren  Warren - Duckworth in 2020! #letlizspeak #shepresists
Bravo, #NastyWomen!
@SenatorDurbin thank you for standing against confirmation of Jeff Sessions
Thank you for standing with her! PLEASe vote #VoteNoSessions He is wrong for USA!!!
You are such a great role model!  Thank you!
#letlizspeak
So happy you represent American women!
we all need to stand up to them
It's the cry of the week.  There will be another one next week.  GO TRUMP
How is that swamp draining  working for you?
I AM WITH HER
NO to Sessions and NO to silencing!!
She broke Senate Rule 19.  She took an oath not to do that.  Actions have consequences.
Isnt that the theme of life?  Confirmation nominees should be excempt from senate rules.   Treated as just nominees.
thank you for continuing the fight. Millions are backing you up!!!  
Keep up the fight. I just spoke with three women on the Metro, all total strangers, all of us furious.
Did GOP leader realize when he said "nevertheless, #shepersisted" that I wouldn't be here today if I'd given up? #letlizspeak #ShePersists https://twitter.com/HeidiStevens13/status/829333633722888193 …
Persist and persevere

Look into @justicedems striving to rescue Democratic Party from corp/big money; bring back statesmen.
thank you Sen.  Let's keep fighting.
You're the epitome of persistence, resilience, & strength. Honored to call you my sister in arms. Keep fighting #ShePersisted
Nevertheless, she incorrectly implied. Again.
Incorrect.  Mrs. King acknowledged his presence.  Facts matter.
You are sending Mitch flowers and a thank you note, right? He's been so helpful to the liberal cause lately. (secret liberal?)
GOP rapidly becoming #GovernmentofOPpression
The difference between you and the members of the GOP is that you are a patriot.
@HeidiStevens13 @SenWarren Stop acting like a child. Be a adult act like a dignified Senator and vote yes to these appointees!
They aren't  qualified. @POTUS is draining the swamp right into his administration
Resist & Persist!
.@SenDuckworth you're a hero and inspiration to all. @SenateMajLdr & @SenateGOP - note, feminism is gender neutral! #resist 

@pwalkerbooks
One has nothing to do with the other.  As members of CONGRESS, You KNOW the rules of engagement.  She BROKE them. and Knew it!
#letlizspeak
amen
@pontelon #resist #persist #GOPDesist
SO WHEN A TREE FALLS IN THE FORREST, YOU HEAR IT? I think not, even if it falls on you, You won't hear it,Right?
Stop repeatedly using your disability. Run on your merits & achievements and stop relying on the pity vote.
Wow! Trump would be so proud of you!
will you and each in the @DSCC take the floor of the Senate and *re*read the Coretta Scott King letter? Please? #WeAllPersist
I beg you to run her as the Democrat candidate in 2020. 
#Warren2020 #LetLizSpeak #ShePersists @SenDuckworth @Truth2Pwer @HeidiStevens13
@HeidiStevens13 @SenWarren and this my friends is why the Democrat party is hemorrhaging. This country needs the ban
The men and traitor GOP women in this country are going to hear a deafening roar because we women have had it.
Thank you for your tireless work in Congress to represent the will of the people and stand up for what is right
No on silencing, no on bigotry, and no on Sessions!
. @SenDuckworth Yes Senator Duckworth! Thank you for your persistence and your service! You are an inspiration to us all. #letlizspeak
Thank you!
EXCELLENT
@HeidiStevens13 @SenWarren this approach is a turn off  https://www.google.com/amp/s/bc.marfeel.com/amp/www.nationalreview.com/article/443973/betsy-devos-hearing-ends-elizabeth-warren-handshake-snub?client=safari …
Always remember @SenDuckworth that YOU ARE OUR HERO!!

So is @SenWarren.
Curious, what does her being a woman have to do with anything?
Are you saying a man can be silenced but not a woman? 
Bigot
Well maybe you should have cause I never heard of you.
Proud to have you as my senator.
I am so happy that you are my Senator!!
Would love to more Senators read the King letter.
MAHALO! So glad you persisted!
#readtheletter   Pick up the baton!
Thank you Sen. Duckworth! 60641
as one your constituents thank you!!! #letlizspeak #ShePersisted
Thank you for your persistence, Senator!
