how is the constitution being trampled on ? What right where taken from women v did I miss something ?
none of them know what the hell they are marching for.
The fact that you two said what you did proves you truly don't understand anything.
ok, what are they marching for?
Health of women, safety of women, the environment, and against corruption.
best health, safety and environment in the world right here.
Like I said.no clue.
And it's abt 2 get better.
Yet you were silent when Obama was forcing people, against their will, to pay for someone's abortion
.@TheInfidelTexan @MSNBC federal money does not fund abortion and hasn't since the 1970's
The morning after pill is abortion, and was debated much during implantation of the now dying Obumblocare
lord Jesus it is not! It prevents the sperm to get into the egg! Literally nothing's dying here lol


@SenDuckworth
fight for what?  Please be specific.  ADA? Is that what this is about?
...but probably not.
Fight your own fight--don't bring Hermione into this!
Judge Judy fair game
@SenDuckworth @IndivisibleNTX You are a Inspiration to Woman Especially those of us disabled! 
Then you better start telling peolle what you and other Senators know !!! Or there won't be any to stop Trump and his band of Traitors !!
@SenDuckworth stop being a victim.  Real warriors don't use their battle scars for political purposes.  Shame on you Tammy.
@SenDuckworth so honored to have you represent us and to see you speak at #WomensMarchOnWashington
Thank you, Sen. Duckworth.   #womenunited #peopleunited #unitednotdivided
so she did murder a baby inside her womb and she calls that "giving up parts of her body"?
No, she lost both legs piloting a Blackhawk in http://Iraq.You  might want to thank her for her service.
I just say she nor USA had neither had any legitimate reason to attack Iraq and its people who had nothing to do with 9/11
@SenDuckworth when you run for president I am voting for you!
I'm with Tammy Duckworth. She has my respect & admiration. #trumpisaconman
No one's trampling on your body. You are ripping human bodies apart because of your selfish, reckless choice.
How ironic - Donald Trump gave up absolutely NOTHING to betray that Constitution and the country.
@Hillaryevents We showed our strength yesterday in marching and rallying for Women and Human Rights globally. Women Convention now
I guess the constitution only matters on the parts of it you agree with.  Because according to you the 2nd is out dated.
We will win. We the people will win. We the American people will win.
so tired of haters on trump. get a dam clue.
@SenDuckworth She made me proud to be an American & a woman. Thank you!
Constitution has nothing to do with your body parts. Your issues aren't a constitutional matter. Your body parts are free to do...
@SenDuckworth Tammy Duckworth 2020!!
@SenDuckworth give him HELL, Senator.
@SenDuckworth I'm proud to have marched with you today, from one Illinois woman to another.
@SenDuckworth so very proud of you and everyone today!! There are strong leaders coming out of this movement! #lovetammyduckworth

I LOVE Tammy!
Warren/Duckworth 2020
God Bless u Sen. Duckworth for all you have sacrificed for our Country!
Given her views on the 2nd and 10th Amendments,... Um?

I guess it's good to trample those parts. Who knew?
RESIST! Depressed after election, NOW-encouraged by entire WORLD'S agreement that Trump is a danger to America & humanity.
IMPEACH @realDonaldTrump. & LOCK HIM UP !!!
@chmayer you can have your parts back!
@pattonoswalt I give money to St Jude Kids can't help that they have cancer.  Why don't you dedicate a film or movie proceeds to PP

I love that woman so much.
She's still using her war injuries for sympathy.
everyone marching is against Trump.
has anyone requested a statement from Trump or administration in response to millions protesting him around world. We want response
What part of the Constitution is being trampled on? Specifics please...
maybe u should have stopped smoking 20 years ago
If your heart stops beating you are DEAD So why when a baby's heart beats you think it's ok to kill it just because you can? #usecondoms
I voted for you!  Thank you for participating in the Women's March!!!  Your constituants support you!!!  #TheResistance
@ShaunKing what exactly is getting trampled on?
You missed the punch line Tammy. You should have said "To have the Constitution 'trumped' by an authoritarian misogynist."
there is many women and men whom have lost arms and legs for our Constitution
Go Tammy
go  @SenDuckworth #WomansMarchCHI #WomensMarch
@pattonoswalt She would be a great candidate for 2020!
Thank you @SenDuckworth !

The Constitution does not give the right to abort babies.  Invented "right"!
I like this Lady!
First Amendment.
@SenDuckworth Thank You.  Stand up !
@pattonoswalt Brilliant!
@SenDuckworth My senator!  You go Tammy!
@SenDuckworth  Tammy Duckworth!!!!
thank you for your sacrafice
god. Bless. Tulsi.
@ShaunKing real woman
To view shocking scientific evidence that proves God exists, watch the video below!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiMqzN_YSXU …
oh, what part of the constitution has trampled on your body parts!
but she's all for killing babies then selling their body parts!!!
wow! It's ok for her to say that! Another new low for women's rights!
@pattonoswalt she was a real inspiration behind her husband sponsoring the District 5 hockey team
3rd wave feminism is BS, but i totally agree w/ "be the change u wanna see" if women WANT to run for office, they should.
@SusanBurnstine <yawn>
WHY Haven't YOU FIXED the VA and Stemmed Vet Suicides?
@pattonoswalt I am Digging that Mad Max Jacket @TammyforIL is Rocking! Give 'em hell Senator!
ohh didnt my tax dollars pay for ur operations
Only after her legs paid for your ability to live in freedom.
really now women can reproduce without sperm. must have missed that memo
wth? Do you know who she is?
Of course. She's my senator. And a real hero, not a fake one.
sorry - was talking to James who seems to be unaware. I'm with you on real hero!!
this is the kind of woman that should be elevated at the #WomensMarch in EVERY sense of the word, this is a heroine
@pattonoswalt oh God, here is Duckworth again playing the sympathy card.
she's so badass
@pattonoswalt I reflect on the scores of baby girls who can't be @ today's march bc they were murdered b4 birth for inconvenience
Who has trampled on the Consitution... other than @BarackObama?
Literal parts, huh? Pics or it didn't happen.
So you are refuting this woman lost her legs in combat? Really?
Is that who that is? Joke's on her. Her legs weren't blown off for "the constitution"
So her defending her country is no longer defending all for which it stands? Or is that only when men fight?
Omg.. you think she was actually defending the country. How adorable are you?! So very adorable, that how adorable.
So she isn't a wounded vet? OK.

you can't broadcast #WomensMarchOnWashington  without first examining your own complicity in the billionaire oppressive class, govs.
@pattonoswalt or to have it given to the Russians
@SenDuckworth Another one who just discovered the Constitution. Where were you when Obama was trashing it? #WomensMarch
Pres Trump has taken anything away from us. Ur all so damn clueless. Blind Sheep of the elite libs.
our rights haven't been taken. Name them?
did I miss it when Roe V Wade was overturned?
sadly a bit late
@smrtgrls She could be president someday
Really Tammy,>>>>>  PLAYING THE CRIPPLED CARD I SEE
@CBOD14 My senator!  Very proud. 
what does that mean
is this a women's rights march or a weight watchers convention
I'm a woman and I don't see where my rights have been taken away. Are they talking about abortion clinics? Constitution says it's ok?
AGGRESSIVE FASCISTIC PEOPLE -1940 HOOD ! APT 5B, APT 5D ,APT 5C AND 4A ! ROMANIAN GYPSY-4A  BURNING WOMEN W/ RADIATIONS!
TRUMP MUST NOT DIVIDED ,DEPORTED LATINO FAM ,TRUMP MUST DEPORTED
LIKE-1940 HOOD APT 4A GYPSY-ELECTRO-ABUSERS FR COUNTRY!
This woman needs to call her psychiatrist and obtain treatment and medication. She definitely needs to try to return to reality.
duckworth has forgot where she comes from
Fake and slanted news all day long! Cry me a river! Hillary lost!!
@TamronMSNBC I see a lot of hate against women here and no understanding mainly from men
Thank you @TammyforIL for your words and your sacrifice and your service. You are a hero. Donnie is a coward. #ResistPutinism
really...after the last 8 years? pathetic
You stand tallest of all!!!!
@TamronMSNBC Pres Obama was not the one passing laws against women GOP Congress was
We will march, we will vote, we will run for office, we will resist misogyny, the stripping of Civil Rights & The Predator in Chief.
Yes you do for unknown reasons, yes you did, yes you did and lost, nothing to resist and what Civil Rights you mean.
You are a little late, that Administration just left!!!
Thank you Tammy, I honor and deeply appreciate your Service & Sacrifices in Military & Community, you are our voice!
@SenDuckworth Where in the Constitution does it say that abortions are a right? I guess I didn't learn that in school.
Not a Day of Rallies....A Day of Protests
@SenDuckworth You're in luck. Obama is no longer in office. Yay for you!
maybe the bible would help. No Christian women could stand for this cause
March on!
Hey #WomensMarch - will you be marching on the Saudi embassy? They torture and imprison female rape victims. No? 
abortionist
typical liberal tactic, "fear". Just ignore... I'm more concern about the increase of rape in the EU due to mass Muslim immigration.
if it's so bad and you want change. Why wasn't ANYTHING done under Obama. You hade 8 long years to fix it?
going to be treated equal not special and it's killing them
-Great, pay for it yourself
if it's so bad for women, why wasn't ANYTHING done in the past 8 years under Obama?
Ahhaaha...where's Hillary their idol?
no one is stopping her from getting an Abortion/Baby Killing. She can pay for it herself instead of government money. #LoveTrump
dam lose Of  memory is another liberal side effect. Sure didn't say a thing when Obama actually did trample on th constitution
liposuction?
mmhh lot's of pussy to grab in D.C tday
Hateful bunch. Evil for promoting the murder of thousands of babies
I don't think anyone would get her pregnant!
Hey theres a combat veteran!
ypu mean the right to kill babies!? #prolifemarch
socialism is not the answer
need to figure out when your helping people and when you are interfering with personal lives-govt needs reined in
rediculous.
Nope . Your mother is not in this picture. You were chopped up on your way out. You do not exist so you can't see this picture
If once you are pregnant you didn't become two bodies, then how come when a pregnant woman is murdered, it's a separate charge? 
What part of the constitution was trampled? This coming from a march co chaired by a pro sharia law/pro hamas advocate.
Выборы окончен, но вы все еще полны дерьма.
And the crazy continues
who the hell is trampling on the constitution? Lets just make up general platitudes.  So Borring!
but it's ok for Bill to rape women an KILLERY to take money from country's that treat women worse than dogs WOW u GUYS r DELUSIONAL
DEFLECTION again. This is about TRUMP.
Tammy had a great speech, Trump and GOP should be scared. They must be held accountable for every decision against Americans.
Who "Trampled" on the Constitution? Oh your pal Van Jones and Obama that right.

crooked @HillaryClinton sponsored and instigated #WomensMarchOnWashington but Saudi Wahhabis funded crooked Hillary,torture women
shut down msnbc for inciting unrest and promoting fake news
just crazy

- where's Hillary? 
use condoms!!!!!!!
Lets make GOP, Grand Obsolete Party
