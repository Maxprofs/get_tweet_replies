@RepTedLieu @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP embarrassing #Congress
@RepTedLieu @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP 
since when has congress been operating under that mandate?
they serve someone-not the American people
@RepTedLieu @RepJaredPolis @HouseGOP DHS is bloated, counterproductive, useless and dangerous. Get a clue:
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP More crap from the Dems, Pass the bill WITHOUT Obama's ILLEGAL overreach! Don't hold Americans hostage
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP Importing diseased aliens so they can infect Americans shows hatred. No desire to protect Americans.
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP Tell Senate Dems to pass the bill that they have from the house, that will fund DHS
@RepTedLieu @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP To uphold the constitution and allow balance of power to ensure overreach never puts citizens at risk.
@RepTedLieu @RepJohnYarmuth @HouseGOP Actually your oath was to protect and defend the Constitution from enemies foreign and domestic.
@RepTedLieu @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP  You know Congress funded H.S., it's his ILLEGAL AMNESTY they won't fund!
@RepTedLieu @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP Actually, that's the job of the President, Congress FUNDS it after approving plan. They funded it!
@RepTedLieu @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP Don't insist on funding an illegal & unconstitutional exec order. It's that simple. #NOAMNESTY
@RepTedLieu @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP really Ted? You democrats have a real knack of doing jack nothing to protect our boarders, so please
@RepTedLieu @HouseDemocrats  Are you insane Ted Lieu? It's the Democrats holding up that funding bill. Your lie not very well.
@RepTedLieu then I suggest you and the @HouseDemocrats get busy and pass the @HouseGOP bill passed by the House.
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP 1st duties of Congress as per Rep. Lieu Duties of GOP: self-enrichment, deceit, favor 1%, lie, obstruct.
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP bipartisanship-negotiate-do not dig heals in dirt. goofs talk to each other of get out!!!
@RepTedLieu please do shut down security, while you're at it #DefundAmerica
@RepTedLieu The butt hurt you are getting on this one is bad.....  Balmex is on aisle 9...
@RepTedLieu @HouseGOP Exactly, you pathetic dolt.  So can we stop with executive amnesty nonsense?!?!?
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP 5 million crimnals are more important to Democrats than the safety and security of the Americal People !
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP Democrats not passing DHS funding prove they care more for 5 million criminals than the American people !
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP Democrats not passing the DHS Funding Bill support 5 million criminals and keep Obama from using his Veto
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP did you really say that ted?  How can you sleep at night?  #BlindIgnorance  #MoreLies
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP The Democrats are on the side of 5 million criminals and because of this will put our Country at risk !!!
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP The Democrats are still trying to shutdown DHS Funding by not passing the Bill and blaming Republicans !
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP "The first duty of Congress is to protect & defend the American people" Tell that to Obama.
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP Well then all Dems must be arrested & put in a cave.  Illegal funding and support is not going to happen
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP   Bite the big one Dems! Tell your boss man to send illegals home. We don't want to support them $$
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP By the way, OBAMA is screwing with our security so what difference does it make at this point anyway!
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP Hey Dems! If it shuts down you will be guilty! Remember that's how it works. You filibuster you shutdown!
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP What's with the filibuster ?? Just put it to a vote ? You complained about GOP doing it! Don't shut down!
@RepTedLieu
@HouseGOP passed a clean bill to fund all LEGAL @DHSgov activities.
@SenateDems holding it hostage to ILLEGAL AMNESTY.
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP Dems are using illegals to destroy the middle class. Dems are #1 Enemy of US
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP why do you continue to post these lies when you know the people don't believe you pass the you liars
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP good one witch!
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP Only non-essential employees are off during shut down. Find out if homeland essential or not...
@RepTedLieu @HouseGOP WRONG! Your oath is to defend the Constitution for the people. No funds for illegal DHS policies. KEEP YOUR OATH!
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi  It is not the duty of Congress to protect the people, it's OUR responsibility to protect ourselves from Congress.
.@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP facts get in the way right?MAJORITY of employees ARE essential & will be working so what shutdown?
@RepTedLieu @HouseGOP - did you read what you wrote and tweeted? Just curious...
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP IF it's shut down...it's because of Obama's veto.
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP WHY? Obama says u r overhyping this terror threat!! So, we don't need all of this protection, right?
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP Tell the @SenateDems to stop the filibuster on the bill you ALREADY passed!  #StopTheLies
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP   Does this mean you're gonna stop the juvenile filibustering?
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP If the bill was clean it would pass in a heartbeat.  Personal grudges don't belong as tagalongs.
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP @RepCurtClawson Party before people!
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP YOU HIPACRIT you say these WORDS but you want SECURE THE BORDERS OR ENFORCE OUR USA CONSTITUTION AND LAWS
@1964dwclark It's spelled hypocrite. Just so you know.  Wouldn't want anyone to think you were stupid or anything.
@cvcrcer Well I must admit I am a very poor speller.  I work on getting better but when in a hurry things happen.
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP funny coming from group that has so much disdain for the constitution
@RepTedLieu @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP then deport the illegals that took our jobs! We will remember.
