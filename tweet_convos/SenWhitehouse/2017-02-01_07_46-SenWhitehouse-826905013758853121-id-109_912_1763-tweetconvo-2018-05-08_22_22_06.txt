The @GOP is exceptionally keen to have hi. Could it be his Russian ties to Carter Page and Richard Burt?
@SenSchumer @SenWhitehouse / Coming from the crooked Democratic Main Street Media. ...
Fake news.
It is the same 15 who have a weapon of choice to use.
What a shock.  You both are from loony land.
Here is one more FOR Sessions appointment. There are several more in my family.
even with these numbers, party will win over the people. As usual.

I am a constituent of yours & you aren't LISTENING TO ME on Sen. Sessions!
"FOR EVERY ONE REGULATION, TWO MUST BE REVOKED!"
@SenateDems @SenWhitehouse @POTUS @VP @PressSec That's because of George Soros is financing the Liberal movement w/protests.
@SenSchumer @SenWhitehouse Chuck, nobody gives a shot what you and your lemmings say
@SenateDems @SenWhitehouse Hold the line on  Sessions, We the People are backing you
@SenSchumer @SenWhitehouse more lies and divisiveness.  Then leave our country there is too much division and hate
@SenSchumer @SenWhitehouse you are a Rudy man and your party is shameful to watch #thisiswhyhewon
@SenSchumer @SenWhitehouse Actually, the majority voted for Hillary.
and we WILL CONTINUE!
I doubt it. I left NY because of corruption & you! You were the final straw! Dems lost get over it!
@SenateDems @SenWhitehouse We would be stuck with him for 30+ years, can't be fired, so do not rush his confirmation.
Sad Truth....
@SenSchumer @SenWhitehouse get on board.  we will vote you out you are not trying to work with the rebubs.  You lost credabili5
Eventually voters will empty the house and the senate of all democrats because of dems childish loser behavior.
@SenSchumer @SenWhitehouse I'm sure.....you ppl are the biggest liars going.
@SenSchumer @SenWhitehouse 
You will never get republicans to vote against him. They won't vote against DeVos.
That is because all of his constituents are airheaded Democrats
I have more people in MY BACKYARD than Senator Whitehouse has in Rhode Island!
@SenSchumer @SenWhitehouse militarized police moving in on #standingrock now! Speak up! This must stop! People will be hurt
@SenSchumer @SenWhitehouse NO TO SESSIONS!
@SenSchumer @SenWhitehouse Popular Vote joins your 15
listen today loved your speech. Great to know my daughter had such a good rep.
Are these the same polls that said Clinton would win by 98%?
@MaggieJordanACN @SenWhitehouse should tell you something!
@SenSchumer @ABCPolitics @SenWhitehouse You're an obstructionist! Resign. The Democratic party is dead.
Chucky Sucks
@SenateDems @SenWhitehouse Thank you Senator. It must be an absolute NO for Sessions. We support you.
@SenateDems @SenWhitehouse Vote No on Sessions
Pity your vote doesn't count.
have you seen this? @marcorubio I'm scared too.(@FlDemocrat you got this ) #Florida
No shit. That's because people who are happy don't spend time writing letters to Senators.
@SenateDems @SenWhitehouse @SenatorTimScott see how easy it would have been?
And 30 of us for every 15 who realize it's a waste to call your office
everyone should call - even those with views other than mine. Use your voice.
I did in November
you see that's the problem -we all need to stay engaged all the time. They are accountable to us
Wheldon Shitehouse is an automatic NO on anything coming out of Trump. I've shared my thoughts with Reed
good. We all need to engage. Just don't want any of them running unchecked.
wow that's quite the opposition did you bring names? Anyone any one at all ? No? I didn't think so
so...the popular vote?
@realDonaldTrump Sen.Whitehouse is traitor to his country.the SOB wants open borders&refugees to get their votes
You constituents are not in the Senate.  The opposite would apply to many other senators.
Nice Whitehouse! Keep it up, please keep it up. The Majority supports your efforts. Thank you @cnn @HuffPostPol
