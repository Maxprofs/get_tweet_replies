@SenWhitehouse another cry baby Liberal Senator who looks SO small to the caliber of Neil Gorsuch.
@SenWhitehouse @HuffPostPol No to Gorsuch please! Vote with the People in mind! 
@SenWhitehouse how about Billionaire Democrat George Soros is he a member of the Dems billionaire club?
I don't think so. Democrats have more and richer billionaires to fund their projects than do Republicans.
@SenWhitehouse 
Whitehouse is pathetic! One of the reasons voters are tired of politicians!
@SenWhitehouse @HuffPostPol add to the list groups that are funded, Russians lobbying in Congress thru The Podesta Brothers
Whitehouse grills Gorsuch as a true defender of truth-how incredible watching a real American Sen do his job
@SenWhitehouse @HuffPostPol "Lecture"...I thought he was there to question Gorsuch, not pander to his political supporters.
Always psyched when Sen. Whitehouse speaks. Gorsuch - you learn more about what a person doesn't say.
@SenWhitehouse Whitey definitely wins the nomination of the "Senate Idiot"..does not say much for RI voters.. smh
same thought. What an idiot...dark $???????
@SenWhitehouse @HuffPostPol whitehouse forgot to tell everyone that soros & dems are running negative ads against gorsuch
@SenWhitehouse @HuffPostPol Bravo!! Well done,  sir. Thank you for bringing up Citizens United.  and other dark money.
@SenWhitehouse forgot to ask about Bildenberg Group, Rockefellers and other globalists who want to take over America.
Donkey Show
Gorsuch is coming across as evasive and weaselly.
@SenWhitehouse  represents Democrats badly. He's just rude and condescending.
Can you expound on OFA that would be nice.
hilarious to watch this arrogant baffoon lecture Gorsuch
@SenWhitehouse whitehouse has taken more unknown money than most hypocrite
@SenWhitehouse @HuffPostPol 
If you don't like the process change the laws.  Sheldon is a joke
@SenWhitehouse doesn't want to hear answers he don't like.
@SenWhitehouse comes across is a #nutjob conspiracy theorist.  Just wow
@SenWhitehouse u kidding this sen is a joke. And rude to boot. Out classed and out smart by a honest honorable gorsuch
@SenWhitehouse @HuffPostPol  We the people democracy not the senate you will be gone soon enough.
@SenWhitehouse @HuffPostPol Has no problem with Soros money. What a hypocrit!

@SenWhitehouse Gorsuch won't answer #DarkMoney question...won't identify it...won't stop it...he's slimey today
#NoGorsuch

You just got your butt kicked!  Good try but you better get my law case under you before you take Neil on!
@SenWhitehouse Mr Gorsuch has schooled the senator on "dark money" and congress' role to stop it
@SenWhitehouse he has been amazing!
@SenWhitehouse Nothing but an idiot-Low class, since when do @TheDemocrats have a soul???...
@SenWhitehouse @HuffPostPol Absolutely awesome point about dark money!!!!! You are SUPERMAN! Brilliant point!
Why don't you let the Judge answer your questions without interrupting or don't you really care?
@SenWhitehouse what's laughable is that old Sheldon "retweeted" this. Listening to Shelly, he's just solidifying #demexit
@SenWhitehouse the more.  More I listen Judge Gorsuch I'm very highly impressed
Where can I donate to the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch?
@SenWhitehouse DEMOS ARE REALLY HAVING 2 DIG 2 find ANYTHING negative about this wonderful man! They R looking very FOOLISH
@SenWhitehouse One thing these hearings show, is what donkeys like Whitehouse we have elected to congress. Pathetic!
