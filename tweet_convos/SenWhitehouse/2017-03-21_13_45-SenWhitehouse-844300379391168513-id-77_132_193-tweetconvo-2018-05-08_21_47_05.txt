When you ask a question, look at him while he replied instead of moving papers around! So rude ! So very rude!
excellent question, TY for doing your job. Wish GOP took this nomination seriously.
You speak of billionaires influence US yet you leave out Soros & other liberals. Are ALL not a concern?  ^..^
What does that have to do with anyone person using money to attempt to change the US?  ^..^
thanks you this is a big concern for our Democracy
Overturn Citizen's, but not the Roe super precedent, is that the idea?
The idea is do your job. He will apply the laws as they are written. Write it.
Mr. Whitehouse is an active recipient of corporate donors yet attacks others for accepting money. Hypocrite.
The left views the courts as a vessel for their fanatical religion
The court doesn't build the playing field. Funny that most MSM outlets collided with HRC. What a joke.
bunch of basement dwellers in here.  Enjoy
Rhode Islanders should be embarrassed by Whitehouse.  Making an ass of himself
Thank you Senator! Democrats need to walk out of the hearing. They need to filibuster any vote.
Them walking out would be fantastic.  Who needs them.
Just how corrupt are we going to allow Trump to drag us?
.@JudiciaryDems @SenWhitehouse 
Backing by Dark Money groups reason enough to vote no on Gorsuch
The only worthwhile thing you said today trying to impune Gorsuch is "thank you my time has expired"...
Whitehouse: a two faced, ignorant tool of George Soros and Dark Money Liberal Interest Groups
J Ginsberg criticized DJT. You want that? Did you say she should be impeached?
They are 5-4 because Dems appoint ideologues.
Interesting line of questioning considering how female Dem cand for Pres operated(s) & how much $$$ she took.
Kinda like the organization that Creamer worked for? And BO's community organizing network.
A loosing point, if this is all you have, then you are history.
What about George Soros and his Dark Money Little Rhody Corrupt State 
Democrat partisan, @SenWhitehouse has looked foolish and shrill during his questioning of #JudgeGorsuch. @senjudiciary @JudiciaryDems
Coming from someone whose candidate raised more than $1 billion, not including donations to The Foundation.
You should stop arguing the law. You make him look better.
Don't blame the Judge for failures of Congress. Funny that You say that with riots going on.
Do you recuse from voting on matters invoking your donors?
OOPSIE Dem Senator Falsely Suggest That Liberals Aren’t Spending Dark  on Gorsuch’s Confirmation http://ntknetwork.com/dem-senator-falsely-suggest-that-liberals-arent-spending-dark-money-on-gorsuchs-confirmation/ …
You should be ashamed of yourself.
how can say conservative billionaires are trying to control our democracy and not mention liberal Soros! TRUTH
You should be more concerned about all of the corruption from HRC and Obama!  Sad that Dem are so childish.
Thank you.  Had not caught this the first time around.  SCOTUS confirmation for sale? Outrageous.
R U as drunk as Franken??
My ? is why did Bubba Clinton take money from Chinese donor illegally & not get chastised. oops
MY ? is why don't U investigate link of Hillary at State Dept & $ to Clinton Foundation?
My values judgement is why didn't U investigate Barry's campaign $ from overseas via credit card>
Maybe we should investigate every penny that helped elect such a lamebrain?  Good idea?? Might be Russian $
Thank You Senator!!!!
Thanks for lying Senator Falsely Suggest That Liberals Aren’t Spending Dark  on Gorsuch’s Confirmation http://ntknetwork.com/dem-senator-falsely-suggest-that-liberals-arent-spending-dark-money-on-gorsuchs-confirmation/ …
Solid, logical line of questioning, Senator.
...thank you for your service, sir!
Yay. We know how sleazy the man is. We knew this before. WHY DID YOU APPEAR AT THIS FARCE OF A HEARING? STOLEN
WHY ARE YOU THERE? PULL EVERYTHING AND GET OUT OF THE ROOM.
@HouseDems & @SenateDems:
#StopGorsuch #PostponeGorsuch
#BlockTrumpCare
#ImpeachSessions
#InvestigateTrump
According to OpenSecrets, 60% of $$$ raised for  @SenWhitehouse have come from "Large Individual Contributions". Dark Money?
oh and he damn well knows who they are.
TY 4  serious & sober questioning. U pointed out  gorsuch is bought so eloquently.
  knows 2
#MerrickGarland
Ok BUT why r we having this hearing? No way GOP allows hearing if @HillaryClinton prez and under investigation
We don't have enough democrats in office Best we can do now is stall, until 2018
It is my money
as a Rhode Islander a Senator you come from the most corrupt state and you're worried about dark money 
Judge Gorsuch is acting like a nominee who has the nomination 'in the bag'. Super-evasive. Not to be trusted.
you have a lot of nerve with all the dark money democrats spend on corruption #potcallingkettleblack
I think we should leave the seat empty and let the court dwindle down, since we lost a seat under Pres O'Bama
Thank you, Senator, for your loyalty to our Country!

We the people don't want this guy confirmed!!
VOTE NO!! No DARK $$$
.@JudiciaryDems @johnlundin @SenWhitehouse Voting for Gorsuch means you endorse stealing Obama's nomination of Garland. #ShameShameShame
#StopGorsuch #impeachtrump @FBI must complete investigation fast
"Dark Money Groups". Because you say it does not make it true. Please try harder.
I love you, Sheldon Whitehouse, even though my Republican RI parents probably don't. 
smart parents
I've noticed lots of commercials for all sorts of stuff for the GOP
hey whitehouse say hi to George soros you two faced jachass
Can't get any darker than Soros, I'm sure he didn't donate.
Right .. because Dems don't use money from Soros You can't attack something you do too 
Talk like humans. Most voters don't know what "dark money" is
 You mean "tRUMP voters?
Of course they don't, his orange leader loves them poorly educated!
#GrilledGorsuch
There wasn't any. That's @BarackObama & @HillaryClinton and @ClintonFdn - don't mislead people. Shame on you.
