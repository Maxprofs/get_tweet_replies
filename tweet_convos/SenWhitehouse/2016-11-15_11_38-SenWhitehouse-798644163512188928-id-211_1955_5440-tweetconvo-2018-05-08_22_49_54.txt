Fight against racist @StephenBannon appointment to @realDonaldTrump team
@realDonaldTrump he will make the door bigger.
Says the man who backed Hillary Clinton the biggest recipient of Wall Street cash. To think I donated to you over the years...
@realDonaldTrump some of us need Wall Street to thrive. Not all of us got pay off from Hillary Clinton. We need to retire.
@realDonaldTrump Swamp not draining. Being filled with more corruption and hate-based excrement
@realDonaldTrump Bernie is the real #PeoplesPresident
We can't expect a crook to get rid of working with crooks

Could you point out where you differ from Soros as described in this article? http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=977 …
where in this link is Sanders implicated? That's too much to read, can you provide the numbered paragraph
'too much to read" is what I hear a lot from liberals.... sigh. No, I'm not doing homework for you.
I read up to like number 100 in full. That page would take like a 45 minute read
notice how campaign called out Koch brothers Never mentions Soros why that is is contained in article
how much carbon does Soros put in the air, and what efforts that he lobbies for benefit him?
I see it as
well, be weary of over simplistic views. They need to vilify the other side so they can steal/ lie
Putting Jamie Diamond as head of the Fed and Goldman Sachs leaders in Admin is not a very good sign
was selecting cabinet provided by Citicorp in 2008 more to your liking?
Sanders didn't select any cabinet member - only voted on the ones presented.
That is correct, Obama did.  Did he speak out against that?
you clearly didn't read the actual email or look at who was involved. Too late now.
Isn't going to happen @BernieSanders Dems really screwed up cheating for @HillaryClinton
@realDonaldTrump to be clear that means have your kids run your business AND be involved in the white house? #draintheswamp
@realDonaldTrump you endorsed @HillaryClinton !!
@realDonaldTrump look around you, it's a good place to start!!!
more bs  coming out his mouth  thats all it was
@realDonaldTrump Trump is the typical political  (it seems) say whatever you have to to get elected, then it's free rein.
@realDonaldTrump - Sen Sanders, what would Hillary have done? B/w the 3 of you, who got paid by Wall Street to make speeches?
can we start draining the DNC swamp?It's time we started winning not losing Governorships, State Legislatures,The House & Senate

@realDonaldTrump Donald Trump will have to self flush! He is the swamp bright orange boogie man!
@realDonaldTrump ...let Trump do what he does best....the rest will follow....give him space
@realDonaldTrump he IS wall street. He isnt going to close any gap. The American ppl allowed themselves to be swindled
@MAHAMOSA @realDonaldTrump maintaining the fiscal #stautsquo will be his #1 agenda - so he can continue toNOT pay taxes
@realDonaldTrump He's got more flip flops than Old Navy on $1 flip flop day
@SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump the woman you campaigned for IS Wall Street. Why'd you back her? You betrayed your supporters!
@realDonaldTrump 

We must call for separation of corporation and state!
@realDonaldTrump Then do it!
@realDonaldTrump true but u need to focus on the corrupt & dirty democrats that screwed you!
@realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump #statusquo and typical "election devices" it seems.
...Government #HONEST? just a #JOKE when he is picking up d TOP #MAFIOSOS n want #TOP_SECRET clearance for the family
@realDonaldTrump they have been draining swamps in Florida for generations. What's left is about 10% of the Everglades. 
He has always been about the 1%. He preyed on the people who need the most and he is going to disappoint many of them.
This is coming from someone who opened up his asscheeks wide open when said system screwed you over. #SelloutSanders
@realDonaldTrump YES. Bernie. Close off ALL the money.   I am NO socialist..nevr, not in least..but respect u cause u are honest
Just why'd you cave to @HillaryClinton after her machine and the DNC railroaded you
@realDonaldTrump Was he being ironic accusing Hillary of being to cozy with Wall Street, promising he would do the opposite?
Oh Jesus, just stop Bernie, u don't need to cover up for BOTH GOP & DNC.  #LegitimizeTheSawmp  #DemExitNOW
@realDonaldTrump how about some hows and not just what's? Otherwise it's all negativity. Who's doing your tweets these days?
@realDonaldTrump He needs to quit going back and forth Bernie. He's lost his mind! #NotMyPresident
YOUR PART OF THE SWAMP
He may have "drained the swamp" but it was just to pick his favorite snakes...and take them home.
@realDonaldTrump look where most of the dems campaign money came from
@realDonaldTrump I bet Trump voters are more interested in infrastructure spending than outlandish tax cuts for wealthiest
So we're supposed to accept this as the new normal? Arrest him and put him in jail. Cause is out there.
Trump wont be able to drain anything
the man LIED every single day
@realDonaldTrump In all my phone calls during primary rare to meet a Trumpster who didn't have some appreciation for Bernie
@realDonaldTrump Drain the swamp? It appears he shopped the swamp seeing the people chosen for his cabinet. Terrifying & Sad 
Bernie, we elected Trump for a reason, we don't need your weak tweets.
How in Gods name can Trump be serious about "Drain the Swamp" while making the West Wing a cesspool. The KKK must go!
Trump supporters R #Suckers
@realDonaldTrump YOU endorsed the swamp, carried your parties water to the end. YOU are a fake.
So, man, revolving doors can't open, like, wider just by their very nature.
@realDonaldTrump Bernie... you endorsed Hillary... the Wall Street candidate...
We shall see which way The @realDonaldTrump actually swings. 
Clinton(s) & Obama got this one WRONG.
@realDonaldTrump 

Love you Bernie but the candidate you endorsed would not have done that. So at least give him a chance.
OMG did Bernie just hashtag #DrainTheSwamp.???
When someone says 'believe me', is a sure sign that the person does not believe in what hehas said.@realDonaldTrump no exception
@realDonaldTrump haaa! It takes being honest to make the country honest and we know how far that goes Mr Trump!
@shesforOKC @realDonaldTrump Please shut up Bernie, U R NOT EVEN A Democrat! U have done quite enough already, please zip it!
Looks like you're getting drained first, Bernie...

@realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump funny, I don't recall you saying this when Obama was bailing out everybody and their grandmother.
Is anyone really surprised now that he's been elected his BS shines through? #NotMyPresident
@realDonaldTrump bernie you really nead a life try Canada i heard a lot of stars are moving there lol
.@SenSanders @DePcan You don't stop the disease by shutting down one source of the infection. Government has become a playground for the 1%.
You and your ilk have had a million years to get it done let the guy get through his #InaugurationDay
@realDonaldTrump Keep fighting Bernie, were with you.
bernie i need details
@realDonaldTrump  Bernie, how much did they pay u to silent you! You showed ur bare behind to ur supporters. Now b quiet.

More footage of "peaceful protests" against the Trump presidency. ;-)  #millenials
Try calling him. And did you not support Hillary Clinton? Seriously, open a real dialogue, Bernie. Do better.
@TalkNerdyToMe72 @realDonaldTrump He need to close the revolving door on our southern border or we really have no 
Jamie Dimon man for the job at Treasury. Or SkullnBones Steven Mnuchin #GOLDMANSACHS partner who worked for Soros #draintheswamp @SenSanders
.. Trump bringing in Goldman Sachs and Fed Reserve people into his administration.
@realDonaldTrump demonizing science,destroying public policy capacity may be popular but leads to bad decisions that hurt public
@realDonaldTrump 
Well, Donald J. Trump is an opportunistic, pathological liar. Sooo... there's that.
#draintheswamp Now that you won. wish you the best of luck. BUT all we see is that you are putting the same old ppl in office.
Good luck with that and Trump himself is not honest so how can he make D.C. honest?
How are you going to stop him? Asking for a friend.
@realDonaldTrump_How can you Claim to "Drain The Swamp" If U're appointing Repub's. Obstruction/non-governance the last 7+yrs ?
@realDonaldTrump this is just another grandstanding lie, especially given Mary Jo White's announcement.
@realDonaldTrump looking at his appointees I think he's just now the king of the swamp. He pretended to be a populist.
@realDonaldTrump GOT EM BERNIE
Squeeze blood out of a turnip but refill the swamp and flood it with Con Artist. Nice.
@realDonaldTrump. Fast talking NewYorker can convince any hillbillies,Rednecks,Klan members that he'sTHE best candidate for them
So far the Swamp is in Trumps Admin!! wow.
Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool. That's both parties' doing.
call him out! #ProgressiveRockstar
Looks like he's floodin' the swamp - and with raw sewage instead!
@realDonaldTrump sanders policies would cost America 15 Trillion. You shouldn't be giving anyone any advice
I wonder what the swamp is saying about that
FBI report: Anti-Muslim hate crimes in America up 67 percent in 2015
Oof. Bernie, I'm behind you, but let's not use the fool's hashtags.
instead of #drainingtheswamp @realDonaldTrump is actually increasing the number of #swampdwellers in DC.  #NotMyPresident
he said he would so.....?
@realDonaldTrump. Dorky term, DrainTheSwamp. Don't like how it sound.
@realDonaldTrump you're part of the swamp guy
Complicit. You won't revolutionize your way back now that Ryan has his "unified Republican government" McConnell doesn't fear u.
Nope, he won't do it.  Can't get richer if he does.
@realDonaldTrump It makes sense that a business man wo public office experience would need some "insiders" to assist.
How about "I will help Trump to close the revolving door between Wall St & the federal gov't so it won't open up even wider" ???
@realDonaldTrump trump needs to do nothing you recommend.  I used to like you. Now it seems you are in the way of progress.
@realDonaldTrump. Give him hell Sanders,
@realDonaldTrump where does one get bodies in 60 days for 4000 spots?
Hillary's shenanigans proves that Bern #Socialist @SenSanders
@realDonaldTrump. How Trump when you have Wall street insiders on your transition team.
@realDonaldTrump Start with draining yourself, Don.  And take your swamp with you.
Sanders, you're one of my few heroes. Keep it up!
He sure does! He must stop enabling the one percent - how does deregulating the Street do that? #DrainThe Swamp #FeelTheBern
@realDonaldTrump Start with yourself!! I don't believe you!! How about releasing your Taxes first!
TDrumpf's fave sentence structure: I  will make ____ ____ again. pfft
Only his filling the swamp with swamp monsters!
yes Bernie and Trump need to go to dinner and work together to #DrainTheSwamp
@realDonaldTrump Brrnie, you sold out BIG TIME! Don't tell Trump what to do or think. You have lost all respect.
Nothing will matter until we #EndTheFed and have honest, gold-backed money. Firing Prince Valiant Yellen would only be a start.
@realDonaldTrump 

Love you Bernie but the candidate you endorsed would not have done that. So at least give him a chance.
We shall see which way The @realDonaldTrump actually swings. 
Clinton(s) & Obama got this one WRONG.
@realDonaldTrump yet you endorsed Hillary??? Get back on your meds Bernie!!!
Actually, Sanders is well tied to Soros http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=977 …
that explains it then!!
@realDonaldTrump Reject Schumer, Make Bernie Senate Minority Leader. http://www.opednews.com/populum/pagem.php?f=Reject-Schumer-Make-Berni-by-Rob-Kall-Bernie-Sanders_Schumer-Charles_Senate-Minority-Leadership-161115-848.html …

@realDonaldTrump will #draintheswamp so he can make the capitol a toxic landfill. #SteveBannon #WhiteNationalist #whatadisgrace
@realDonaldTrump he's now the swamp king and he doesn't even understand what that means.
Did you ever think a self-proclaimed NY "billionaire" would ever do anything but only help the wealthy & himself?
That's easily solved by locking down the salaries of fed gov employees
@realDonaldTrump Come on Bernie,Trump is owned by Foreign Banks and you know it! Do something about it! Make Trump feel the Bern
#help us burn
@realDonaldTrump and the likes of Monsanto and the FDA
Draining the swamp by having an establishment insider and a Goldman Sakhs exec as your two top aids... Awesome

@realDonaldTrump And fill it with slime! Working hard to make your next 4 years a living hell. #NotMyPresident
@realDonaldTrump No better than you.  You could have stood up against a corrupt system but you chose to support HRC.

@realDonaldTrump you are sounding like a reviving record. People will get tried of all of the whining
you mean it's not draining the swamp if you're just pumping muck from one swamp to another? #createanewswamp
But that would mean no bailouts.  The left won't like that.
how much of that wall street money did you take from @HillaryClinton  to sit down and shut up Bern
