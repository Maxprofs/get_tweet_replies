Good lord sir, this was debunked and wasn't remotely true. You shouldn't be posting such nonfactual crap science like this.
pis off m8

heh 10 years later and ur still propagandizing...
give me a source from somewhere like the epa, or nasa, or any other credible environmental organization.
weird how you only trust government sites and not the climate scientists themselves.
weird how you didnt actually provide any evidence from climate scientists and that division of NASA is run by climate scientists
even if they didn't get caught fudging numbers again, did you really think that consensus is science? Flat earther much?
-points towards humans having adverse effects on the climate?
@SenateDems be able to explain where and how this 97% was obtained or refrain from perpetuating this lie.
http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/ …
97% of the small % that answered the study. That 97% concluded minimal impact as well.
climate change is real but it is cyclical and humans have minimal impact according to Cook's study. We are entering a mini ice age!
link?

1 study means literally nothing in the face of countless others, especially ones that NASA cites
have you read opposition research or just the ones that conform to your own bias?
-likely true.
I dig it. We can disagree and still hug. Take care.
Any statistic that the left loves that much has to be fake news
http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/ …
Oh.My.God. He's got a graph! Who paid for that data?  Who stands to benefit from the conclusions?
The human race stands to benefit for those conclusions. If you have any evidence, like I do, I'd be-
*from those conclusions
Not my responsibility to give evidence. When do you plan to do your part and stop using electricity?
aaand that's when im done
what were you doing the past 8 years that NOW is all of a sudden so important?
More proof #Climate was critical to him years before #Trump https://twitter.com/SenWhitehouse/status/147442436774440960 …

Ignoring climate change won't make it go away. Senator Franken & I make the case for action on #climatechange: http://bit.ly/sxJrkc 
2) his tweet was "must act NOW" implying that imminent harm upon us if no action taken, been hearing that for yrs
Like telling an alcoholic they must stop drinking NOW and the drunk arguing that he's heard it before so ...
#ClimateFacts is the best thing on Twitter today http://buff.ly/2jDfqsB 
what does a thermometer have to do w/ "climate change" and "must act now" or else? #LeaveEmotionsAside
we need to act now not deny the obvious
Climate const changes & thats what the small % of scientist who resp to the survey agree to but not man caused, be honest

that's why the @SenateDems and house need to stop being weak suck ups and fight this Nazi in the White House.
@NNUS 96% of internet statistics are made up. Let's see your list of names. #maga
scientists march on Washington!
Yes, scientists are absolutely correct, warming since the ice age.
YOU ARE THE GOOFYEST SENATOR IN THE CHAMBER
@SenateDems Trump believes in climate change when it benefits his golf courses!
as late as 2009 Trump & kids signed climate change petition! http://grist.org/politics/donald-trump-climate-action-new-york-times/ …
If the climate is warming due to man, you should thank my family for us driving SUV's or you'd be under a glacier right now.
#climatefacts the only truth about climate change is that it is a scheme built to control people.
Can you post the list of all scientists who responded to the survey?

I'll wait.
source for "97% of scientists"?
No, not fake. One quick google search reveals that.
http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/ …
climate = it snows and is cold in the winter. 
weather = it might be snowing right now.
@SenateDems Withhold consent!! Never mire warranted than now! Employ!!
Do something about it? He works all weekend, where is our reassurance from you? Not working this weekend?
@SenateDems pls protect health care first. You need to focus like the R's & defeat them 1 issue at a time
well @realDonaldTrump is about to give 100% of those 97% the pink slips they deserve for being so reckless with regulations.
@SenateDems The women's march that littered the streets of DC? Climate change starts with a individual!  Not the Gov't!
.@SenWhitehouse @CharlieBrB 97% is a myth based on fraudulent research
@SenateDems I agree. Climate change is real. It is just that it is not caused by man. Most scientist agree with me.
unless you have polled 100%, you cannot make that statement..it is illogical
This is really fake
@SenateDems Vote No on @BetsyDeVos for #EducationSecretary
NO to ALL Trump nominees! Deplorable!! Yeah to Gilibrand!
@SenateDems Well I guess 3% job retention rate will have to do.
@SenateDems Facts and science have no place in the new world of Alternative Facts.#MakeAmericaSmartAgain
Repeating the same debunked lies about 97% makes you lose all credibility.
What MOST 97% do NOT agree on is human evolution's contribution to CM. So now you want FORCE us to pay right?
Climate change has been real for 4.5 billion years. What is the primary driving force of it Sen. Whitehouse?
@SenateDems  yes your paid for your cause to get more funding! We don't live in a close bubble. Stop with your double babble
@SenateDems we're going to lose 4 years and 4 years only. Maybe less.
1st: Your post is deceiving. It's 97% of "climate scientists only." & 2nd: You're wrong. https://www.google.com/amp/www.forbes.com/sites/alexepstein/2015/01/06/97-of-climate-scientists-agree-is-100-wrong/?client=safari …
@skookerG prove it and not okay Pruitt.
Just curious: Someone just asked me for the verifiable "97%" stat source & I can't find. Could you please supply that? Thanx.
the same scientists that get paid by the government! What are they going to say "We found nothing don't pay us" #Idiots
@SenateDems All BS
@SenateDems and 98% can't comb their hair.
@jaytay777 show us with your vote
LEFT UP TO NEANDERTHAL REPUBLICAN PARTY -- WE WILL GO EXTINCT!!
Where do you get your statistics from? Same place as polls saying Hillary won?
"Mr. Cook found 0.3% of all 11,944 abstracts or 1.0% of the 4,014 expressing an opinion, and not 97.1%" #PeerReviewed
America must Resist... Resist the "Freedom Vampire...Count Trump"
@SenateDems who are the 3% who don't? And where the hell did they get their degree?
@SenateDems Yes, but unfortunately 3% of scientists say orherwise & it's those people who have the ear of the President.
@SenateDems & NOT man made. It's a natural occurrence that can not be controlled first time gov. stops weather let me know
that’s a poll, not science
I guess 3% odds are good enough for the @GOP and @realDonaldTrump.  And they are trusted with our money and safety?  #f&cked
We are just a blip on the grand scale, yet can destroy ourselves in the blink of an eye all for selfish greed.

@SenateDems You should have acted in November by voting
@SenateDems climate change is real been hap'n'ng for millions of years. But we should still do our part to reach a clean wrld
Tell Trump that.
@SenateDems Stop lying to these people.
Nothing you can do about it, won't hear a peep about these oil sheiks and their European masters.
Talk.
3 out of 4 dentists recommend Trident.
Cool, now you're walking to work, right?
That's not completely accurate actually they're climate scientists or climatologists who's work is funded by Govt grants thus
How is a self-serving politician like @SenWhitehouse going to save us from a bad turn in the climate?
Sheldon, I respect you as a colleague, but 3% doubt is too much risk for working Oil Execs to take #ClimateAlternateFacts
It's actually 43% try again
cool. I suggest you stop breathing as your exhale is killing me.  Murderer.
Now that you know #vacuumwheels. How about some Political support? 50% R/R for SUV / Truck 2025 Cafe requirements. How Else?
I'm going to increase my carbon footprint, but don't worry - nothing will happen. @SenWhitehouse
Run that empty dishwasher!
