Shameful democrats just obstruct bc they have no ideas. Trump & Republicans in 2018&2020 #MAGA

RightDems r childish&have no good issues to run on bc they only believe in themselves
Obamacare killed good healthcare in this country for millions of Americans, what makes you think you are qualified to speak on the subject?
Speak for yourself since you are probably getting yours from work or FREE. For those of us who were forced to pay, millions of us have none
If you aren't in top 1% of earners, I hate to break it to you but you mean nothing to the GOP. The @SenateDems you're attacking have ur back
lmao.  They care only about themselves and non-citizens.
U nailed it 100%. Nancy needs to inform herself better but of course she won't because she hates Democrats more than she hates being conned
Watch for more from progressive liberal Socialist democrats followers of Saul Alinsky
One step from communist

I'm watching the live coverage from the Senate Democrats FB page. I want to thank all of you for holding the floor & speaking on our behalf.
Republicans need a few democrats to vote for the replacement plan. Can we count on you?  Obstruction will get old after 7 more years.
Schumer should be an actor in Hollywood, California 
Sorry a comedian 
Disgrace!
Schrumer can NOT BE TRUSTED. Corrupt to the CORE.

Love how @SenWhitehouse always brings visual aids
America is getting more than tired of Schumer's incessant negative blabber that is totally partisan and has NO value.

Obstruction at its finest! You failed healthcare, you lose.

Wasn't @NancyPelosi who said .. "we'll have to pass it, to see what's in it..." I encourage @SenateMajLdr to use the nuclear option on dems!
Couple of criminals. #Obstructionists

Please reach across the isle and let them know America deserves affordable healthcare.
Thank you for looking out for American's best interest
How about both parties actually work together to get insurance companies back in the HC market so premiums & service gets better

Perhaps they will win this battle but for sure they will lose the war.
Thank you for fighting for us! SHUT THEM DOWN!!! You see how Mitch McConnell acts? Dems need to be that way too!! DEMAND!!!
Thank you Dems!
The govt doesn't have a working healthcare program that they can turn to as a success story.
Many Drs refuse to accept new Medicare patients
So proud of all of you! Keep up the pressure!
Truth is that people drafting the heath-care bill have country's best interest at hear. Something that you dont!
We know it can be a thankless job, but countless Americans thank you.
Watching. I would hope Senate dems woukd insist on being involved in this bill.
Keep it up! #HoldTheFloor
Democrats have gone 100% anti-American.
