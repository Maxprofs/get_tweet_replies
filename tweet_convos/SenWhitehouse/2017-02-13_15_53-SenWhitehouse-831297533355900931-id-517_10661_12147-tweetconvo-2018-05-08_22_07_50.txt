On Saturday Mar-a-Lago guests watched @POTUS deliberate w/ foreign leaders w/sensitive documents on the dinner table
This is US foreign policy, not this week’s Saturday Night Live. GOP should take @POTUS' conduct seriously before we regret the consequences.
The White House may be closed for public tours, but you can get into the Winter White House if you pay $200,000
@badgirl_loony @washingtonpost  good reporting, corruption rampant.  But you couldn't pay many of us to tour DTs WH? Sick!
@MaddowBlog @SenWhitehouse Has a full list of members been provided to appropriate Senate committees & security agencies?
Great Question.. has that been done?
His Russian friend (Handler) Dimitry is down there this weekend.
@GOPoversight Great job Senators. I wonder what the House Oversight Committee has to say. Gentlemen....????
@ResistOhio2018 @SenWhitehouse Probably because they have no answer. Have you met @realDonaldTrump and his gaggle of goofs?
@LovelyLowEnd @SenWhitehouse Obama neighbors who own on same/adjacent Chicago blocks must display credentials to get home.
Why didn't they answer you?
@Mssun20Parker @SenWhitehouse what are your plans now?
@now7grandkids @SenWhitehouse Stay the course. Resist. This is an existential fight!!
some noted that Dmitry Rybolovlev attended. Google him. Would want to know if he was there.
and let's not forget TREASONOUS TRUMP RUSSIA TIES!! #INVESTIGATENOW #RussianCoup
@normangoldman @SenWhitehouse We got that email thing under control though, so we're good right?  #RepublicanOrAmerican?
@tuncket @SenWhitehouse So what's being done?
seem like reasonable requests
Um, they asked to see the financial statements of each individual, and asked them to bring a bag of money.
answer:GOT MONEY GOT ACCESS
giving out the security processes, is a breach of the security process. #Demidiots
if they are rich enough to get in its ok.
And you expected to hear something back?
Make you wonder why you don't get a answer. No republican has the balls to pen such a letter. Good job.
@CitizensFedUp @SenWhitehouse 4 weeks and already the MOST incompetent administration ive seen since the 70s
Nixon was a cheat and a liar, but he was a competent one ..This is far worse!
valid! Any response yet? @GOP must investigate! Total incompetence. this 'winter' palace is not US property!
you mean two vacations ago?
how about lawn and pool guys have they been vetted?. Maids, servers, bell people, maintenance..list is big
@now7grandkids @SenWhitehouse but I am ok with that.  Let them in
Because why would they screen? Too busy with "extreme vetting"!
2) if any other foreign leader was as dumb as Trump, I'd WANT us to infiltrate that leader's club
great.  What are you doing about it?
Persist.
That info might be on a "need to know" basis. You probably didn't need to know... #Shenanigans #FakeNews
"Clinton asks for $353K to sit with the Clooneys" http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/hillary-clinton-george-clooney-fundraiser-221207 …
Somehow you don't get the attention, why? #Democrats need to get tough & loud. We want loud IMPEACHMENT talk
Only one thing can fix this mess:  IMPEACHMENT.  RIGHT FUCKING NOW!
@TriciaHastings3 @SenWhitehouse you never will, either
not only do they not use extreme vetting,don't vet at all,as long as you have $200k u have access #paytoplay
You won't hear anything back either. Bahaha it's like writing to @Comcast no reply unless a legal complaint.
Trump supporters your president is busy with his self tanning he has no time International Security or any!
The only screening that takes place is $200,000 ending up in Trump's pocket.
Robert Kraft was there.   He should be able to answer some Q's.
Figures.  Hillary was deemed "careless" and "reckless".  Trump is arrogant, stupid
please LOCK HIM UP!!
Thank you for doing your job!! Everyone else should follow! #Resistance #PresidentBannon
..access to Hillary Secretary of State was "donation" to The Clinton Foundation was more than $200,000 no?
Did you write a letter? Did you demand investigation? vetting? security credentials for all involved? Huma?
Why were you silent? Did you just get a seat in the Senate?
Were you complicit? What was your participation in Obama doubling debt, Iran cash, approved "propaganda"?
Who approved "military propaganda" on your watch?!
@BrooksDslbrooks @SenWhitehouse our great senator from New Mexico fighting for the people from New Mexico
And U are responsible for open borders and the murder, rapes and other crimes committed by illegals.
Ask again. Your country needs you!
@RedwoodGirl @SenWhitehouse it's really hard to get gold plated metal detectors
Sir, I support this since our nation's security could be compromised.
shocked!!
@tomcolicchio @SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump Ok "mr president" Any plans to answer this reasonable request? Likely not
and what about the foreign temp workers they hire? Extreme vetting necessary!
Why they invite then to take photos of national security briefings at dinner of course!
@LimeAvocado1 @SenWhitehouse so taxpayers will pay to send him to Mar-a-Lago every week to entertain his customers
@7im @SenWhitehouse  Please get him and his cronies out of the WH!!
Ok, so if he continues to disregard our elected officials who are our connection to him what will you do?
@tomcolicchio @SenWhitehouse So DO something about it instead of tweeting about it
@tomcolicchio @SenWhitehouse Well now it's time to press hard for answers, seeing how that dining room became SitRoom eh?
@tomcolicchio @SenWhitehouse use THE LAW to find a way to combat this insanity
words are fun, but  He will not do what he is not legally compelled to do. Writing stern letters is useless
@Lindsay05946319 @SenWhitehouse and he will be back this weekend to pass on more info!
nice work! I know it's exhausting, but never give up!
Thank you for calling investigation and open inquiry re: hacking of election etc., from this Dem in Ocala FL.
@laxgirl016 @SenWhitehouse I'm sure you did. They don't think they have to answer to anyone. This is not your company!!
Whitehouse is an Establishment Traitor and voted for Trumps Cabinet picks.
party before Country is not acceptable. Congress needs to look past their short term interests
Keep doing what you do! We will remember. Your integrity will be intact.
I'm taking bets on how long agent  orange  is going to keep  the seat warm in the white house
You won't because they don't. 

Hear back.  Screen guests. Won't. Don't.

Donald J. Trump is incompetent.
Thank you for your efforts. It seems it's a new world under this presidency,  and we need more to step up.
$200,000.00 pay to play. Easy way to except donation. When tax payers pay $3,000,000.00 every time he goes
rich white people dont commit crimes  I guess. Lol
Maybe it is time to demand an answer.
He should have to use Camp David instead charging the government to host foreign PM at his unsecured resort.
#ImpeachTrump
you mean talking shop amongst guests as they tweet about it is not the status quo?!
Had a membership list been released or is this like his tax returns 
what do you plan to do about this?
OMG,LEAVE IT ALONE WILL YOU, IF IT WAS ANYBODY ELSE ELECTED, YOU WOULDN'T BOTHER,
This is seriously dangerous. Guests taking pictures of nuke football, listening to calls, but emails....
@Independent @indy100 @realDonaldTrump Donald is the swamp! The white house is now in Florida. #weaselDonald
press secretary lied about this just today!!!
Stay on them! The safety of the US counts on it!
Mr Trump doesn't have any remorse,ethics or morals. He is a self absorbed schoolyard bully.
They need time 2 cover up.
keep asking
. @SenatorTomUdall @SenWhitehouse They just ask, "Did their $200,000 check clear?"
By their wallets?
@e0f571cf1c5a4c7 @SenWhitehouse "Crickets"......
AND...ALL WE HEARD FROM #GOP WAS #HILLARY WAS SECURITY #RISK! #HILLARY DIDN'T PUT A PIMPLE ON #TRUMPS ASS!
follow up. Continually. And document. Via tweet works so we are kept in the loop.
Please demand a thorough investigation into ALL conflicts of interest in the WH.
@Sabertrooth @SenWhitehouse the answer is simple . They don't screen anyone . Anyone can come and go #members #guest
Not *anyone* - not POOR people. Gotta have $200K
ya I put members and guests didn't have enough room to explain lol
I knew you know; I just wanted to snark.
lol
pay for play
the American people should not have to put up with a President who does not take our security seriously.
Security to guest : Tovarich?
Guest : Da.
Security : Welcome to Mar a Lago.
#trump
lax security at Mar-a-Lago will help sell club memberships, so what's the downside for Trump?
only spies with a 200k membership fee are allowed in?
unless they are temp foreign workers.
As it's now "the Winter White House" does that mean its been given to the Nation?  Very kind!
@asweetvictori  The best way is to go to the golf course, there is the chance to meet Trump very much, and ask directly.
45 has made it clear that if you are rich and privileged he doesn't bother looking any deeper. Incompetent
just lay it all on the table for my resort guests review!
@MitchBenn It would be easier to compile a list from who is posting photos of official secrets on Facebook
@kathie_konka2 @SenWhitehouse Now you've heard. Words are too hard for them, so there's lots of pictures!
if you have $200,000 to join that's all the vwtting they do it's per your bank account and credit rating
well, now you know.
lock them up derpppp
@KenBerry611 @SenWhitehouse They don't. And then they have wealthy nitwits posting pics to Facebook. Good god...
why they give them cell phones and invite them to photo  meetings about NK.. Get rid of him!!!!
So obviously it is not secure,  what action is Congress going to take
I would say the answer is if they can pay, they're in.
guess they assume that if you can pay $200,000 your not a terrorist. worst than what they criticized Hillary
@CitizensFedUp @SenWhitehouse @Impeach_D_Trump @realDonaldTrump not above the law! Loser staff
the implications are frightening. trump thinks he's the guy throwing a big global party
yeah and we are paying the tab!
@MBax11 @SenWhitehouse So you're Twitter shaming the White House until somebody pays attention to you? #Maga
good luck with that, but only 2 senators signed? .. yeah. going no where.
If they could afford the doubled to $200k membership they passed, #Oligarchs R trustworthy!
Senators, please! The President must be investigated. We are at risk.
Thank you for raising this concern Senator Udall!
They have a very straightforward security check. If the checks clears, the guest clears.
Thank you! Keep pushing on this. Our national security is a risk!!
Everyday I wake up, it's a new nightmare 
guess that's what they do nothing
@janbhess Really sad that he doesn't even respond. Wonder if its because there is no vetting except $200,000
Mar a Lago isn't just a place for trump to make money.Its a unsecured Russian communications meet up.
There was a Russian there this weekend! He is the same Russian who kept flying in for trump rallies.
Isn't it obvious? They DON'T!
@GOP And how are Mar-a-Lago Staff vetted?
Stay on it. This matters.
1) I wonder how many of the Mar-a-lago staff have been approached by, or are, foreign spies.
The staff at Mar-a-Lago are all Eastern European foreigners here on visas to work for Trump.
Push also on Guest Worker program.  I doubt any "Extreme" vetting has occured
.@SenatorTomUdall @SenWhitehouse Good luck every getting a reply, b/c the answer is they don't & they won't.
Interesting
hmmmm I wonder if Russia has planted a spy. Maid, waitstaff???  Florida white house should be fully vetted
THEN DO SOMETHING!!!
And you're pushing for a follow up with full investigation, right?
They check everyone's smart phones on the way out. Oh wait, no, they check immigrants' phones on the way in.
Fucking kidding me. Nothing about any of this is sane. GOP disgusts me.They should disgust everyone.EVERYONE
Lawless administration doesn't have to give you answers because they know you are powerless.
@pas89101 @SenWhitehouse Because they didn't screen. They are rich and trustworthy people, Duh!
This level of incompetence puts the country at risk!
So he gets to make $ off being Pres, get away with ethics violations and creates security risks!
Please call for an investigation, Senator. For them to dismiss security concerns so easily is dangerous.
It seems wrong to take foreign leaders/ WH visitors there, profiting Trump while taxpayers foot the bill.
thank you for moving forward on this
matter.
they pay the fee,,, and that's good enough for them
Thanks!. I would feel better if he was hanging out at Camp David instead of making money off his presidency
there could presumably be undercover Russian agents at the Winter Whitehouse
Ask this guy.
@MaddowBlog @SenWhitehouse I support this effort. Expose trumps corruption and impeach.
how about preventing security briefings in middle of ballroom with cell phones used for lighting?
the people that work there or being considered for employment also need to be screened.
Maybe #JudicialWatch the non-partisan govt accountability watchdog will get on the case @Nupe117 @SenWhitehouse @TomFitton
Thank you
Our country is at risk from this shit show. They had the nerve to worry about emails? Time to shut it down.
@misdaws @SenWhitehouse Then keep asking and demand answers. WTF?
thank you senators. Keep pressing, don't let him ignore you or try to distract.
He doesn't care... Money hungry will always put greed over safety... Problem is that they always get caught!
The guests are instructed to login into their checking, savings and brokerage accounts.
@Ummismaelsf @SenWhitehouse I just can't believe this is happening. Why isn't everyone in congress literally up in arms?
Because Republicans just spout BS when a private corporation ask them. #SellOuts
& THEY complain about ppl on welfare?Talk about a govt paycheck for nothing!
Basically Republicans seem to sit around wait for what they are told to think or do
I guess you guys got your answer...
If rumor that Trump replaced Secret Service agents with his own hired guards what clearances?
@dalcantonJD @SenWhitehouse keep up the good work for #WeThePeople
thank you for doing this!
@waltiepooh @SenWhitehouse   Better ask again
I appreciate the tone & content of this letter, but for future ref, Winter WH is @ 1600 Pensylvania Ave
proud you are my senator @SenatorTomUdall! Go get 'em.
He's hiring 60+ foreigners for housekeeping, cooking,etc workers (Americans not good enough, I guess?). There will be spies
@Leta_says @SenWhitehouse Another question about security: Are 45's foreign employees being fully vetted to work at resort?
all Donald Trump cares about is making money,save América ,if you know how,
@Jxnewton @SenWhitehouse Don't pat yourself on the back for sending a letter. Take action!!
I'm sure the vetting was extreme!
It should become a private home the minute he was elected to ensure security & control of access to leaders
AND II DOUGHT YOU WILL EVER HERE BACK.
THANK YOU. Don't stop asking. The majority of the American people are behind you. #Resist #ImpeachTrump
Good question. Here are some others we would ask about security at Mar-a-Lago: http://goo.gl/w7VVG7 .
I've made hundreds of calls to my congress, stood up w/ my brothers and sisters.  You wrote a letter. #Coward #resist
Not extreme vetting! @SenWhitehouse
Is that what you think fulfills your oath of office? Write a letter then a complaint on Twitter 2 wks later? SAD! #resist
now living in a reality world. #45 will get us blown up & @SenateMajLdr @SenatorCollins  GOP @SenJohnMcCain
