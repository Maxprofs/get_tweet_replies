.@THESAMUELSTEEL @SenWhitehouse Al Gore is not a scientist. These are the folks you should argue with. You'll lose. http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/ 
WARMING, SO WHAT? WHAT CAUSED THE GLACIERS  TO MELT?
.@THESAMUELSTEEL @SenWhitehouse @NASAClimate Ignore Gore. Read the NASA and EPA sites. Then get back to me with your detailed rebuttal.
Know anything about correlation not equaling causation? @THESAMUELSTEEL @SenWhitehouse @NASAClimate
.@Stick_Man_Says @THESAMUELSTEEL @SenWhitehouse 1. That's why theoretical models and climate measurements to confirm & improve are critical.
.@Stick_Man_Says @THESAMUELSTEEL @SenWhitehouse 2. If you have no theoretical mechanism for age vs murders, it's coincidence not causation.
.@Stick_Man_Says @THESAMUELSTEEL @SenWhitehouse 3. Climate theory is complex and incomplete, but mature enough to persuade ~97% of experts.
You are truly one of the good guys.Thank you.
did you know @SenWhitehouse won't oppose a gas & oil-fired power plant that would cause RI's climate emissions to skyrocket?
He's a good guy. Let's keep our focus on the Repubs ffs instead of running purity tests on our Dems.
purity tests?  RI'ers have reached out innumerous times for his help regarding the proposed PP
The Senator has a very good voting record on many issues.He's one of our best.
he works for Rhode Islanders but refuses to speak on our behalf.
Keep asking for purity ---you'll be in for a whole lot of disappointment issues are complicated.
not asking for purity.  Asking for accountability .
BEFORE YOU AWAKEN, YOU NEED TO GET SOME GRAMMAR LESSONS.
Do something about it? He works all weekend, where is our reassurance from you? Not working this weekend?
@SenateDems I agree Sen..But from where I'm sitting.. There's not much hope...Damn shame really!!
then get woke on how a fracked gas powered plant is coming to your state and speak up against it.  #noPowerPlant
#fool @jimmy_dore and his army is coming after you, you are finished #TheResistance #JusticeDemocrats #USNews #USElection2016
@SenateDems @DrewDWitte @LucySeger
Except you support #NuclearPower. Can't be that woke & support something that is #NonRenewable & #Hazardous to the 
Have you woke to giving up your own use of fossil fuels?
Sock it to em @SenWhitehouse
Thank U! Life on earth at stake. Irresponsible to ignore. Clock ticked today. (and block all trump appointees!)
Pander much?

Congrats on looking totally foolish.
you are on notice... We will accept #NoCompromise #ObstructTrump #TheResistance
Keep up the good work.  You make me proud of Rhode Island!
if Whitehouse is serious, he needs to oppose the Invenergy power plant.
Thanks!  I'll have to look into it!
Thank you Senator
Word of advice. Never, ever, say that again. When old people like yourself try to talk like young people, it never works well
you keep it up Mr.Whitehouse. I kinda have a crush on you and I am married to a Rhode Islander
Wow dude, you're so...so...hip? Not too smart, but you're "hip to the lingo", and that's what matters to politicians, right?
won't help defeat a gas power plant proposal, destroying forests and water in his state. #alltalknoaction #lastterm @projo
@SenateDems Are you voting yes on his nominees? You're not woke.
Um.  You've been awakened.  Stop trying to talk the young people, geezer.

I'm awake no worries.
Don't try to be something you're not.
Try "awakened". When in doubt, use English, if you can.
there's always been droughts, flooding & temps going up & down

And I've been rundown, I've been lied to, and I still don't know why I let that woman make me such a fool. Shelly's a hipster
#PollsAreNotScience
@SenateDems Me too! Let's kick ass!
@lindarutter @weatherchannel
I think the word your looking for is awoken
more important right now - this Healthcare vote! PLEASE vote against repeal! Work on REFORM!
r u speaking to the ole farts in congress who regularly sleep thru presentations!
thank you, Senator, please persuade your colleagues to wake up and stand against Trump
Ugh, I really am a fan of yours Senator. But I wish you would fight for our Economic rights the way you fight for the climate
Wake up? Where is your support for #vacuumwheels. 8 years of Obama Administration...No Action. Selling Problem over Solution.
Go back to sleep.
More like #climatefakes as far as I can tell, and a good way to bilk the taxpayer. Me, I'm awake. Not woke.
must step up & grow a spine! @HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer @OfficialCBC @TheRevAl @MARCMORIAL
@SenateDems yes it's time and it's time for all Senate Democrats to FIGHT and vote NO on all of his remaining cabinet picks.
@SenateDems America wake up
'97% Of Climate Scientists Agree' Is 100% Wrong via @forbes
@SenateDems too funny!

Oh my God everybody run for your lives were all gonna die...... I mean die laughing

@SenateDems or at least got voted out of office
I appreciate you standing up for our planet, and I hope you stand up for civil rights by voting against Sessions.

thanks for the heads up!
Hi Sheldon - thanks for your work. Almost done with a book discussing in new ways. Would love to help keep your state dry.
yell at them, scream at the top of your lungs! Things are going from bad to worse.
It's not that they're asleep, it's that they're greedy.
