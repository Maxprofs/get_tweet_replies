When Gov have complete control over your healthcare, it will not only B 2 costly, will B inadequate.  Like UK, we will wait 10 mos 4 biopsy!
Not to mention 50 ways to administer plans?? How inefficient~
Aren't you exempt from Obamacare? Can you explain that? Healthcare costs are skyrocketing for public and private unions.
Some of us have no insurance, moron!
States 2 receive Fed funds & decide how spent, can't deny preexisting.  Better than Fed tells all.  Sanctuary states may have 2 choose?
3/5  Did we really have 2 legislate "accountability" 4 our vets HC?  Yes!  UK has free HC.  They have AIDS epidemic, offer AIDS test kits
Because you have a large Medicaid bill unlike other states now who get much less.  GC gives equal $ Amt for each state resident = fair!
2/2 parents.  Fed matched state funds, 4 every "slug"  they signed.  Especially helpful in Sanctuary states.  G-C will end Medicare Exp.
Conress was supposed 2 use AHC plan.  They found a "way around", by declaring themselves small businesses, saving 12K.  Had 2 lie 2 qualify!
4/5 in vending machines?  Y not C "free" Dr ?  No disease or partner control.  Uk has lost 2400 Hemophiliacs 2 AIDS tainted blood.  How does
Admit it Sheldon, you oppose everything proposed by the Trump administration.
Bc patient protections are no likely to be scrapped in Rhode Island alright
2/2 the reason, HC is out of control.  Can congress separate now and offer 'free" HC?  Can't trust!  They will cull costly from their budget
Trump bullshit! Healthcare without preexisting condition coverage is no coverage at all.
They have repeatedly stated it covers pre-existing.  This is a false statement put out by people only looking out for the money.
1/2 Have already been denied Medicare service, by Dr's w/closed practices or quota of Medicare patients.  Dr's will not treat "free" HC.
Vote these liars out!  Give any pvt plan a chance, before U take what congress wants 2 give U.  Free HC paid w/taxes.  Remember the VA Admn!
Can't afford Obamacare? Pay a hefty fine in April and congress doesn't care!!!
1/2 Congress has pandered 2 100's of healthcare lobbyists.  Offer campn donations, cash & trips. Their success at corrupting congress  is
5/5 this happen 2 so many, 20 yrs after screening?  Did they cull population w/contamination?  UK now denies care to obese (30BMI) & smokers
2/5 VA Admn is a good example of free HC 4 vets.  Pres Trump had to pass the Accountability & Choice Acts, to rescue vets from bureaucracy.
You haven't even read it.  Please read the bills before voting on them. Dont just vote with your party
1/5  Dems continure to obstruct any healthcare , other tha Single Payer.  Single Payer is "free" HC, but U will get what U pay for.  Beware!
They are getting MORE than their fair share now and SHOULD lose!!!!
2/2 Wealthy (politicians & celebs) will retain DR's in pvt practice,  Pop, treated by nurses or Dr's w/bad credentials.  When U can get it.
Thank you for fighting for us all Senator!  With a smile and great admiration, GCD
The Rhode Island TAXPAYERS ARE getting hit w a double healthcare cost increase whammmy. Wait until Obamacare fully implodes...
https://www.google.com/amp/amp.dailycaller.com/2017/09/21/dem-sen-blasts-graham-cassidy-admits-he-hasnt-read-it-video/ …     You haven't even read the damn bill!!!!
1/2 When Swampers say states lose, they mean this.  O expanded Medicare 2 cover healthy people of working age, same people piggy backed on
Peanuts. If you like ACA then opt to go on it yourself. Middle class and small business owners are getting killed with ACA. Get to work!
Shell has not evn read the Bill, He takes his orders from Maxine Waters!
Did anyone read the bill?
Will you actually read the bill?
Oh, but I forgot to READ it before I trashed it because I'm about Party dogma, not my constituents.
Oppose but haven't actually read it. So... i guess "we will have to pass it to see whats in it... eh Senator?
God I hope so!!!!   democrat taxes are destroying the American Middle Class
u are on media dissing it & haven't read it. i guess it is like ocare you have to pass it to know what's in it. clean the swamp. term limits
I thought the left was all about wealth redistribution. i guess JNIMBY.
Nevada here. Tell @SenDeanHeller he's lost my vote. #GrahamCassidyNO
The free enterprise system untied from big government will make insurance affordable! My voice falling on deaf ears! #RepealObamaCarePeriod
Stop wasting tax payer dollars. Worthless, ignorant cog in the broken wheel. Fade away
We need a simplified veto to end Congressional spending. You obviously have no self-control or desire to be fiscally responsible.
Brilliant post that tags all the right people.  Thanks @SenWhitehouse from a RI native, invested in our healthcare!
Lead the way Senator.  
P.S.  Is that really your name?
VOTE NO ON #Trumpcare
We need a simplified veto to end Congressional spending. You obviously have no self-control or desire to be fiscally responsible.
Will @SenWhitehouse ever show any fiscal restraint?
FY 2017 US deficit of $673,711M = $1.396M debt a minute
What happened to the Kasich-Hickenlooper proposal?
To bad so sad.    Maybe people will have the same thing happen to them as the rest of us did.  No health care!!!
Yep you are about follow the dollar to. Money talks and Bullshit Walks follow the dollar. F the USA people tax them more.
Thank you. We oppose this bill!
What is the dollar amount lost for my State... NJ?!  I know it is alot, but dk not gave the figure.

THANK YOU FOR THE LEADERSHIP!
Thank You!
Funding from who? I'm tired of paying for your state's healthcare.
Please stop the bill!
Could you point out where in Article 1 Federal expenditure of money on health care is Constitutional?
Thank you for opposing this racist, sexist bill. Literally sick to my stomach thinking of those that may go bankrupt from medical bills
Shellie takes his orders from Maxine Waters!
KEEP GOING SEN WHITEHOUSE!!  And, Thank you!
.@SenWhitehouse thank you for speaking up for all those who would be affected, many of whom cannot speak for themselves. #GrahamCassidyBill
Absolutely not true! Rhode Island get rid of this clown
Maybe you can get @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @SenDanSullivan and maybe...just maybe @SenDeanHeller onboard-last might be asking too much
Cuts need to happen. Where do you suggest they come from?
@SenateGOP, will Senators in states facing massive healthcare cuts ...oppose unethical #GrahamCassidy?
Given Skinny Bill was rejected by 2 vote margin, why do u think..and what can be done?

nothing like passing obamacare that will full of lies.It was not affordable to the middle class but you didn't care.Your voters are mad
Is Sen Alexander rolling over? Was his bipartisanship mere cover, while GOP devised #GrahamCassidy?

You are a Democrat OF COURSE you oppose it... what else is new? NO democrat is going to support it beside MAYBE Manchin.
1st ten months of fiscal 2017, the Treasury still ran a deficit of $566,022,000,000 =  $1.3M debt every minute
Fed contract employees reveal the corruption! Stop it before its passed to the next healthcare program!!!
https://www.amazon.com/Hatched-Secret-Inside-Look-Affordable-ebook/dp/B0757CCJZR …
How about the entire country? You have a duty to your state and this nation! Do you duty, Senator! Honor your forbears!
Here is Shellies Private White Rich Beach Club where he talks like Thurston Howell on Giligan's Island!
Good!!!! The Disaster known as Obamacare must be destroyed!
You should pay a part of healthcare costs! States should pay fair share
That's not true. You lie. It would block grant more than that to RI. Why do you want government to control my healthcare? STOP!!!
how about congress using obamacare and giving up the plan they have now? come on big mouth walk the talk!
@bgeorgoulis 
That's because RI politicians don't know how to conserve, make good budgetary decisions, oversee wasteful and fraudulent spending, or count
It's better than Obamacare. Heck anything would be better than Obamacare.
Get Educated...
FASCIST GOP sick BASTARDS: would eliminate lifetime caps, pre-existing conditions, allow coverage denial, cancel policy when get sick, etc!
duh if they work at it every year it can be fix duh!!!
That's their point. Take billions from Blue States and pump it into Arizona Alaska W. Virginia Etc. force those R Senator to vote for it
#GOP new slogan is hurt as many people as possible to all .@sengraham2016 only protecting he few donors
Talk to Collins  McCain  Murkowski  Capito   beg them
You should oppose it because it's awful. Not because there's nothing in it for your state in particular.
@senrobportman @SenSherrodBrown look at all the states that will lose funding. Do what is right. Vote no.
Yeah and your party has done so much of American healthcare. Raised the cost, didn't cover the people promised. You have no credibility here
You oppose everything. In a couple months I bet you will oppose Christmas.
Where is all this funding coming from, and do you realize we are in debt by trillions?
A Trump bullseye!!
Lmao u mean u would lose donors.
Really u don't add! How people legally born in state of their birth certificates Fact vs immigration law violation. ©®™Confession alert 
Many are missing! U find all! Return them to their land ownership rights! Outrageous ®™©
Behaviors of @ABAesq ! @ChicagosMayor arrest Virginia today for illegal contact with victims of ARA not allowed or authorized to profit®™©
Heaven forbid if it makes payments fair.
It doesn't.
Oh No! Removing the individual mandate would hit me soooooo hard. How will I survive without paying all those fines?!?
Also, giving States the control over healthcare would make the founding fathers roll over in their graves. Disgusting!
I'm
Isn't the GOP leveraging money for political gain? Is that ethical?
Thanks, senator and I stand with you. My vote is a resounding...
American politicians & what they're TRYING to do to The People are pretty fcking disgusting! GREEDY PIGS "representing" The People!
Wow! I'll vote for that!
Stop welfare to illegal aliens
Right over your head #MAGAt HC getting shittier and more expensive for everybody.
Over what timeline? Seems like a significant detail carefully omitted from your chart
Hi good afternoon Mr SENATOR .
