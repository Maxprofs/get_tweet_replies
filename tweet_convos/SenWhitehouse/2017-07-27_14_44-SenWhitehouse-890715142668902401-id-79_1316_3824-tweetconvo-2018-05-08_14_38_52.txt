.@SenBookerOffice please keep fighting for our health care!  We need more senators like you!!
Where in the world do you live where this healthcare is so wonderful? What plan did u choose,?
Oh @Christy26617100, health care is not great in CA, I just don't want it to get worse. I felt that it would with that skinny repeal.
I'm open 2anything that restructures HC properly. Where RU? How bad is it 4U? IMHO we should elim insurance cos & start from scratch. U?
I am in an area with doctors and hispitals but its expensive, i chose the silver plan because I could afford it monthly,big mistake
Great words tonight. @SenBookerOffice
Thank you for representing and fighting for your constituents.
Ohhhh but they have to have House 'assurance' that it will go to conference.  
Yes  ok so  even if it . the  Ag start more crap so  Don backs down  what do you think?
Thank you for not only fighting for not only the people of NJ, but all Americans.
don't get too upset bc of this bill
remember: once they get in committee 
they can start over from scratch
my understanding is McConnell & Ryan will draft a new bill with input from the  GOP caucuses  in both houses and may need to wait until 1/2
after recess  (Sept) to learn what the compromise (house on right & sen toward center) looks like - then again I could be entirely mistaken
TELL US MORE LIES - WE ARE USED TO GETTING SCREWED BY ALL OF YOU - NO REACH AROUND NOT EVEN A KISS. JUST STRAIGHT ON SCREWED!
You were great today on the floor. Very moving speech.
Thank you, @SenBookerOffice . Here's my story:
1. Thread. Maybe no one will read, but I just heard @SenJohnMcCain voted yes. Yes to taking away my healthcare. Life saving healthcare.

Yeah is you like your doctor you can keep your doctor ... Right Cory?
I'm trigger by the name #SkinnyRepeal can we please stop body shaming
Your solution was a lie, and now you want us to keep pretending it worked. It doesn't. Millions were kicked off plans and forced onto Ocare.
Ocare, lies of keeping your doctor and it's not affordable. Can you afford your free lifetime medical plan senBooker?
Do u have another option to improve #ocare ?
Well first let him  get back in their when Bell gos off he's not going down without a good fight
He said "let's get back to work" I don't c doing any work- the only work I c is criticizing- that is not "work" if I wld do that I wld fail
Your Speech was tops.  Corry  please request more time and tell them what your pop would say.
We don't like Socialism..but that's what u trick your voters into. Like Gruber said..they r too stupid 2 know better. #sad
Don't tell us - tell some republicans
Why don't you get busy reducing that crime in your state?
Seems self evident 
@JerryMoran #MoranOut @patroberts @SenPatRoberts #RobertsOut #Kansas #healthcare #HealthCareVote #SkinnyRepeal #BREAKING

All so that the most wealthy citizens get their tax break, for shame GOP! You and your pseudo Christians will share space in hell... 
Thank you for fighting the good fight. Keep it up!
shouldn't the american people have the power to overrule a senate vote?
Do you guys ever get anything done? We the people are tired of zero results!  It's time the people of the USA  takes over, we are over it!
They should put it to a vote in a general election and let Russia decide.
Anyone who votes for this fraud, after not voting for what the people want: clean, full, total repeal, NO REPLACEMENT, better update resume'
As unbelievable as it seems.... They are going to pass this.
Everything makes so much sense when it comes from you. 
Does #SkinnyRepeal mean fat unhealthy people can't get affordable healthcare?
Is this the same guy who lied about saving a woman's life??? Yeah it's him lol...
WRONG
get something to committee 
ANYTHING at all
just get something to committee!
Any statesman or stateswomen under stands it. The bs maneuvering and posturing is disgraceful.
 don't vote for it & it will repeal on its own- Ocare was designed to file
If only they cared what was plain and simple!
#SkinnyRepeal is a trap
.@SenateGOP should not pass #SkinnyRepeal so the House can pass & send straight to the President--w/o consideration, hearings, scoring. 
Sorry to have to explain this to u Senator but the Republican Senators don't have hearts, morals or brains.They can't understand pain&simple

#ResistTheResistance
Skinny or fat they're bad bills
repeal repeal repeal
Voting 'No' doesn't move the chains. There are no simple answers but you guys are supposed to be smart. Talk to each other & figure it out!
And if you believe we should have a single payer system, vote for it.
Single payer with a cap on approved procedures and medications.
Please read @aliranger29 story about her son Ethan to your fellow Senators.
I'm sure you know the algoritham is liitle longer than that, right?
BUSH DID 9/11
#CoryBooker2020
Cory, please stop being a senator and go back to community organizing. You are not an effective public figure.


I SUGGEST U WORK TO CLEAN UP THE NEW JERSEY CESSPOOL U REPRESENT! http://www.therealstreetz.com/2015/09/03/newark-nj/ …
As if that would stop deeply concerned @SenJohnMcCain and @LindseyGrahamSC. Wish they had balls as big as @lisamurkowski's.
McCain is a coward
why does this even have to be said
No Senator, if the people that you are supposed to be representing don't like the bill, vote NO.
Any Senator who votes for a bill they oppose, you'd have to question their competency. @SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC
Waters interrupted Treasury Sect Mnuchin-disrespectful behavior now defines left & they grow more combative & lose decency they once had
Wait... is that REALLY an option? Not sure McCain or Graham know how to vote against the party line
And @CoryBooker does?
Block u black out @DaveChapelle_  ur face all wrong! One lie u out clause @RussiaConnects ©™® Degree verification for all in healthcare
Takeovers accounts & we just on Twitter @jimmykimmel outrageous behaviors. ©®™ migrants unfit for entry even in the circus u needed a skill
A vote against repeal is a vote against the middle class. ACA is a failure. Premiums and deductibles are skyrocketing.
no- its just a legislative vehicle 
this isn't the real bill
it's just procedural
Don't like big Pharma supporters
You actually had to articulate that? How dense are your constituents?

Can u & fellow @dscc get on TV & say Vote "No" 4 this bill & "Yes" 4 birpartisanship.
"Plain and simple." Thank you Sen. Corey Booker. @Michael36776349
