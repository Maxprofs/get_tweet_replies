BLOCK THEM ALL! @Kelly_Herself
You're European?? Then you haven't "won" anything. @SenWhitehouse @Kelly_Herself
Screaming this kind of nonsense as if suddenly they can be open racists again, is all they have. Good luck.
What kind of heritage do you come from with the name Agnusich? You're 71 years old---have a little dignity. @Kelly_Herself
Well, back in my day, women weren't in the service unless as a civil servant or nurse. I am neither.  @Kelly_Herself
you are my new hero  you were amazing at Sessions debacle
Shameful!!!

You did a great job today against Sessions. Ask Repubs why teachers have to be "highly qualified " in their majors to teach
.@SenWhitehouse Was suspension of rules itself a violation of Senate rules?  https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CDOC-113sdoc18/pdf/CDOC-113sdoc18.pdf#page=10 …
@humanimal_k9 president Mussolini has no regard for the American people. He carries only lies and hate. He must be stopped!
@Specneedsmom4 #impeachtrump
funny cause according to the @nytimes you've voted yes to all of his picks...
there have been 5 votes on the less controversial nominations.
block them all. NONE are qualified.
no way. We will prevail

but, DeVos doesn't have to have 1 oz. of experience or understanding of what it takes to teach a child.
good for you for speaking up!  They are all cowards!
@SenateMajLdr Why have rules if you aren't going to follow them. McConnell you have an evil heart.
@Arianna8927 when you going to wake and realize what you are dealing with?
shame is useless against the shameless. DO SOMETHING. Wake the fuck up and fight for us.
Most of us are behind you. #Trump is out of control and #Republicans have boarded this runaway train.
Keep fighting!
@mesquitepenny The GOP Congress has become a Rump Parliament
Lifelong MA Dem, you were too hopeful on MSNBC about Alt-facters 'eating crow', been eating Trump/Putin shit since 20th.
I find it so frustrating that @realDonaldTrump insists of vetting others when he not his cabinet picks have   been. #taxes
Please keep fighting. Thank you Sir!
Just as shameful for Dems to vote yes on Drumpf's cabinet picks #Traitor
via @samsteinhp 
Jeff Sessions and Dominicans
@Alisonnj because you may actually vote No?
All the Dems voted NO at #Sessionshearing
Thank you for standing up at the Sessions hearing. You were awesome. Republicans were not.
Where do you come up with all the #Garbage you speak?
by the way, your view and actions on climate change is all wrong. The earth is 4.3 billion years old, how many changes ???
The Rs showed norms mean nothing to them when they refused to consider Judge Garland's nomination.
like, DeVo's lol. It seemed like, she wouldn't answer a simple question. #BritneyArmy #iHeartAwards #BestFanArmy
they like ruling not governing
@MrsProudie Two words, Seanator. Withhold consent. #resist
@bannerite Shameful??  How about illegal!?
yet you voted yes on 4. Don't worry this will be your last Term.
STOP VOTING FOR THEM
@bannerite Didn't you vote YES on all of them?
@EricBoehlert what's your counter move
@SaveMain_St You're vote was most disappointing. We shall not forget.
@Lindafblue Hell, you voted for most of his nominees.Sit down & shut up.
thank you for standing up for us.
Senator let's impeach Trump
Only cheats change rules midgame. And then they shouldn't be allowed to play. Shameful. Democracy slipping away since Garland
@NEVERMYPRES and obama was never my president lmao
SHAMEFUL MY ASS - YOU COMMUNIST DEMOCRATS ARE THE SHAMEFUL ONES!
Sessions evaluation was spot on!  Thanks for speaking out on behalf of us who feel helpless to stop such bigotry.
fine job sir
Questioning the nominees FOREVER serves NO purpose! You will obviously vote no, then get on with it, for Gods sake! INEPT!
Show up if you want 2 ask your questions #StupidLiberal! BTW U forgot Holder-Obama relationship close
http://www.realclearpolitics.com/2010/03/19/the_trials_and_tribulations_of_eric_holder_231196.html …
He has no shame, or conscience. His way or the highway. DEMS have to push back and obstruct.
So you spoke highly of Sessions and working relationship at first but follow it up w/he sucks, a bigot and more. 
thank you for your speech this morning at Sesdions hearing! BRAVE if you to speak truth of Trump office #resist #impeach
your shameful for reading that liar David Brooks I pray for your failure upon reelection
Fantastic comments @senatejuduciary this morning. Plz post text and video. 

#Resistance #notsessions #notmypresident
ur the only shameful acting.  Your party is going up in flames and the people of this wonderful country are watching with awe
Your obstruction won't work,  Sessions will be confirmed. You're only losing more moderates & independents.
maybe keeping his soul and standing up Thor American values and ethics. Bravery in face of authoritarian regime.
More hysterical crazy talk. Won't mayer when Dems have no power.
Thank you, Senator.
At least they wont PLEAD the 5th like all the Corrupted Liberals did. Karma
Democrats have endangered our nation with their delays &disruptions. You cant complain about implementation when you obstruct
What a crock of partisan  crap. Your divisive fear mongering is shameful.
I can't wait to see who replaces you during the next election cycle.  #replacethesefools #vote
I've never been more ashamed of a Representative than you.  You are the problem. You should be embarrassed by your actions.
thank you so much!!
the picture that yur painting to the American public about "weeping families" a few years from now is a disgraceful n false
Your absurd, frenetic Sessions rant was the worst batch of partisan lies and insults ever heard on the floor of the Senate.
Beautiful States, but Sir you SUCK.
Is that your idea of advise and consent, geeez
Thank You sir!!!
you sir are an obstructionist and obviously bitter about the loss of your lousy and failure of a candidate @HillaryClinton
You can pretend all you want, but we can see how you're voting. 85.7% WITH Trump, and counting.
great lecture at AG hearing - minus a few points for mentioning that idiot Joe Scarborough
Thank you for your comments on Sessions  
You are my new hero!!!!!Thanks!
you sound like a jilted lover
@EricBoehlert #GOPHatesAmerica #GOPHostileTakeover #GOPMustGo
lol, sucks to reap what you sew, huh?
Still bitter about Failed @HillaryClinton loss - your rhetoric about @SenatorSessions n @POTUS is bitterness n lame
Sir, don't u understand? Americans, we THE People don't want norms and political hack status quo. We seek action! @POTUS acts
you are boring me to tears. Just shut up and step down off your soapbox. You are such a liar!
Thank you, Senator for speaking out on Sessions. We desperately need majority of Americans voice 2 be represented! He's unfit
#ethics @HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @RepJaredPolis @RepYvetteClarke @RepTedDeutch @AnthonyBrownMD4  #trumpleaks #Resist
No Sir, shameful u r STALLING @jeffsessions & other qualified nominees to our new @POTUS Cabinet. U will lose. U already hv.
Sheldon, I saw a chart that said you gave a "Yes" vote five times for them. Please tell me that's not true.
Was it AG Holder who was held in contempt of Congress? Notice u didn't mention him as 1 of AG's whose tenure did not end well
Vote them OUT
Thanks Senator!! I hope other Democrats get some spine and follow your lead!
We appreciate your voice.
Thank you for speaking for us!
This divisive "senator" needs to be voted out. Reckless with the Safety of Americans & Out of touch w reality. Do nothing -GO
shameful but completely unsurprising
Cheering and inspired by your brilliant, concise, important speech before the Sessions confirmation session. Thank you!
great speech at Judiciary Cmte this morning opposing Sessions  !!
We've had Holder & Lynch, 2 freakin Racists that ONLY Served Obama! You Hypocrites LOST the Election. We get to chose!
you're upset about Lock Her Up?  
You are a real POMPOUS A-HOLE! Your Lies about @SenatorSessions are deplorable! All Lies! We're NOT electing a Dem AG!
your a fearmongering lefty from a tiny tiny state

Keep speaking for us!  Thank you!
that's all the left can do. Blah blah blah 
if youre going 2 take a stand you have better places to do so than on twitter. Vote no. Definition of hypocrisy #notmysenator
Thank you, Senator, for standing up for the people of this country. We're with you - stay strong!
then put your votes where your tweets are and vote NO. #filibusterscotus
I hope you have a plan B. The Republicans are never going to check Trump. Will Dems ever learn? Block everything!
#NotMySenator
@GOP the party of "law and order" breaking the law!
The shameless can't be shameful. Just sayin'.
@EricBoehlert Trumpian tactics. If you don't like the rules, change them. How does this reflect the values of democracy?
@EricBoehlert Are you learning your lesson yet??? OBSTRUCT EVERYTHING!!! Work with them on NOTHING!!!!!
A lousy idea unless you want 4 years of anger and division which only hurts ALL Americans.
The GOP succeeded with that strategy.
Senate confirmed 7 of 8 Obama cabinet picks on his Inauguration Day. Democrats are
You guys are sooo principaled, Shellie .

They have answered all of your questions. You are just trying to cause trouble versus respecting the choice of the People.
explains your 4 yes votes if your not satisfied with the process....Not One NO Vote:
Oh snap! Bobby's got you there.
No the words you're groping for is criminal and unconstitutional
@EricBoehlert #StopPresidentBannon
they showed they had no shame long ago.
excellent speech on AG nomination session! Thank you!
