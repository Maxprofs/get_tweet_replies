Shall we talk about Democrat front groups with dark money?I believe Dems have been caught taking foreign money.
Riiiiiiiight. He has every penny accounted for with notations as to what "favors" have been "promised".
@Lee_in_Iowa @SenWhitehouse 
Exxon, Russian money
He just told you he is a corrupt politician! Kick his butt out!
I am tired of getting Heritage propaganda favoring this nominee.
Why has Soros been spending $$ 2 support pathetic dems?@DNC @katyperry @FoxNews @Gop @MiceeMouse @adjunctprofessr
no one but Merrick Garland should be in that chair!!!!
Today we witness how ugly the fanatical Dems are.They are willing to smear one of the few honorable men left.
how much "dark money" is being spent to keep Gorsuch from being confirmed.
Too bad we cant just use all of the money from both sides to pay for healthcare or other useful things
@Lee_in_Iowa @SenWhitehouse  we have the most corrupt government in the world. How did this happen?
This is a no brainer!
from a NE constituent. Please hold tight Dems and do not confirm Gorsuch!
Wrong answer!
Dems seem to know a lot about "dark money". Lobby and PAC money they receive considered #darkmoney. Investigate.
It's not his turn! Garland is still waiting for his vote. Make McConnell go nuclear. It's on his head
why is Soros doing the same for YOU?
I think Gorsuch is lying about be dark money. Watched him today. Do not confirm!
Careful #WeThePeople may actually demand all Election money be disclosed&limited. How many groups does Soros fund
He forgot to throw in "because of Citizens United"
How much money is the opposition paying?Do you really want us to know about Democrat dark money. #DamnHypocrites
2018MAGA, Democrats out!
what a hippocrite. Didn't hear the name Soros
@chickfactorzine @SenWhitehouse and yet the Gorsuch wants to keep the dark money dark.
.@SenWhitehouse thank you SenWhitehouse! keep it coming! Gorsuch should die of shame stealing a seat on SCOTUS
You allowed McConnell to block Garland for a year and now your going to cave to him again. What is wrong with you
There is a lot of corrupt shenanigans going on lately.  To many furtive deals going on, and dirty money in play.
Daily commercials here for IA Rep David Young. He's apparently gonna vote for it cuz they're saying it's great.
Russia.
Stop distracting and do your job.Focus on his qualifications.
Track the dark money for Democrats, millions in special interests in they're private accounts!!
you're desperate
Do not confirm Gorsuch! We don't want dark money judge. wait 4 FBI investigation results before filling the seat!
Great answer. Democrats hate the constitution
The dark money is coming from Democrats.
Koch Brothers???
You do t know who they are but you know how much money they're spending and on what. @SenWhitehouse is nuts.
Thank you for not forgetting those ads. Gorsuch never answered to it. Red flag.
Has anyone checked to see if Gorsuch has any ties to Russia?
Democrats ARE EMBARRASSING EACH OTHER THE WAY THEY ARE TREATING THAT MAN. WHERE WERE YOU ALL WHEN HILLARY LIED

good question. They are running tv commercials to promote Gorsuch.  Things that make you go WTF?
for the same reason they spent millions to get you elected. they think it would be good for America.
DEMs why r u even there. u do nothing but steal our $$
where is the proof? Lets see your proof. #PutUp or #ShutUp
you dems.are liars
Whitehouse looked like a kid who didn't take his ADD meds during questioning. All jumpy, fidgety & contrived.
it's a #stolenseat. Unless they put up Garland, you gotta vote no.
Please, our country needs you to do a "Bork job" on Gorsuch! He would be a disaster!
*rolls eyes*
you should not even be holding hearings. POTUS under FBI investigation and STOLEN #SCOTUS seat! It's Garland's!!
@morganarae @SenateDems @SenWhitehouse No, it's not. Garland never had 60 votes, let alone 51, FFS.
Why did Obama meet with his college judge in Hawaii 48 hrs b4 he blocked Trumps travel ban?
@peoples_defense @SenWhitehouse proof plz
By Repubs own rules... Campaigning prez doesn't get to nominate SCOTUS pick. Nor a BLOATUS in his LAST year!
I just read through several of his cases and his confirmation worries me. And is he pro or neg LGBTQ issues?
Vote no against gorsuch
Why?  You seem to be trolling for the sake of trolling.
Yet Dems have 0 problems with Soros funded shadow groups.
Whitehouse press, Interrupt Sen Whitehouse questions to Gorsuch, Asking about dark money, Trumps timing. Bored
Look at all the DARK MONEY and secret meetings with the Deep State...America is not stupid!  You hypocrites!
I'm unable to get through to anyone today, please, for your dignity and ours, NO on Gorsuch! Thanks for your Q's @SenWhitehouse
Please Democrats filibuster him. Let's get the Harry"Nuclear"Reid Option put into effect for this one. Beautiful.
We shouldn't fill vacancy while we have illegitimate president in ofc. You held open because of Obama. Keep Open
@NCDemocrat @SenWhitehouse @SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris Keep evil off the #SupremeCourt! #resist!
Furthermore, the criminal element in the @TheDemocrats party like @HillaryClinton proved $$ make no difference
gorsuch lied, he KNOWS who is behind that dark money campaign!!  #voteNO
Evidence? Proof? Didn't think so...#darkmoneytinfoilhats
oh gimme an f'n break!  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/us/politics/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court.html?_r=0 â€¦. If YOU don't know it's because you don't want to!
 Your whole argument is based on co-ownership of a fishing property. Are the trout democrats? 
@GorsuchFacts #MerrickGarland
@SenFeinstein @KamalaHarris Do not vote to confirm Gorsuch. He's not a moderate and it's a #StolenSeat.
AGREE. Inappropriate to confirm DT SCOTUS nom while DT undr investigation
Dark Money? Give me a break. How much dark money is being used against him?
Feckless Dems are pathetic....is Liz there does she get to talk?  Please let her so you sound more feckless..
Better feckless than peckerless
B/C we know @TheDemocrats are crooked, self-promoting dirt bag politicians who fail voters repeatedly @gop @potus
block him!
If a Dem sitting POTUS were under active FBI investigation, would R's hold hearings for their SCOTUS nom? 
at least the block chain don't lie
with his address you can find sender addresses, and those should each be tied to an IP if I remember correctly
Glass houses @senatedems  Careful when you criticize.
I think he is very practiced.
because be a a phenomenal candidate.... some questions don't need answers if common sense is used
Grow up. This is why we lost. Your posturing for the childish hypocrites on the far left holding you hostage
THANK YOU
Vote NO on Gorsuch
#GorsuchHearing 
@POTUS @SenSchumer @SenateGOP @TheDemocrats @GOP @SenateMajLdr
WHY vote no?
.@SenateDems If I was Gorsuch, I wouldn't want to know who was spending AGAINST ME. Would you, @SenWhitehouse?
#CitizensUnited
