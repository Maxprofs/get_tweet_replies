@sierraclub @EPA I don't think the American people will be shocked at all -- this is what they voted for, right?
d under educated and illiterate doesn't know what's they voted 4. Some only voted 4 #WHITE
respectfully, it's also true that the left MUST stop thinking of right wing voters as ignorant
Even when they cut off a factual debate by screaming LIBTARD?
hehe funny :) but who's 'they'? Surely not all conservative voters, or a majority
Just enough bad apples to make the whole barrel smell funny.
Fair enough 
Surely you jest.  Shocked?  I don't think so. We knew Trump was an anti science, anti EPA, climate denier
but he wasn't always that way
you're probably coming to regret this vote, aren't you @SenWhitehouse? just like we said you would http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&session=1&vote=00242 …
@JuddApatow @EPA Or Eric Holder who conspired with Obama to enduce "signature strikes" on americans,Drone killer Obama
Or are you just talking about some fake news conspiracy bullshit.
Eric Holder said it himself look it up,here wait ill get it for ysla
@BeltwayPanda @EPA You give Trump voters too much credit.
please don't vote for Pruitt in the Senate
Thank you for your courage. Where are other US Senate voices in opposition to trumps awful cabinet?
arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
hilarious
Hes a buildin a wall by golly!
@JuddApatow @EPA I don't believe Trump has killed thousands of innocent people,doctors women and children,Obama has
He supports Assad/Russia's bombing campaign. Doctgors. Women. Children.
so until he actually does it like Obama and Holder he hasnt done shit yet
they were not shocked about his rhetoric and slander of minority's, women. Lies become acceptable as long he keep lying
@CoenJamesOlson @EPA to be honest, I don't think Trumps minions give a shit
@JuddApatow @EPA please use these confirmation hearings to shed light on bipartisan opposition for the public
.@SenWhitehouse @scurwood @EPA I'm eager to witness this shock you expect. Been waitin' for it.
1/2 shouldn't there be job description for any govt. positions -public service that demand u do NO harm.
@MaddowBlog  hell wasn't already hot enough?! I am running out of words to express my utter disgust
The election needs to be investigated due to Russian interference. Was it legitimate? Was it corrupted? We need to know.
@sierraclub Most of his supporters could care less and they could care less even more that the majority of Americans do care.
It's COULDN'T care less.... could care less makes no fucking sense.
he works for the office of redundancy office but you see how this exemplifies this thread?
You expect that the Trump voters care. They do not. They wanted to flip off the rest of us and then they washed hands
shocked why, Dems sat on their asses and let Republicans steal a SCOTUS pick @HHooversGhost @EPA
No they won't.    Sadly, they really don't seem to care.  These people never should have made it this far.
@MaddowBlog @EPA  just more swamp fill by trump
This is worth a filibuster to prevent. I expect a "Presidential" tweet-storm attacking Miss Universe to distract us.
@JuddApatow @EPA aparently you do not know the american people...
Sadly, after this election, I doubt it.
@JuddApatow @EPA Lol. Thank you Democrats for changing the senate Rules. #winning #51votes
Not surprised at all - DJT's advisors want to dismantle US government, then use it to enrich their business interests.
@JuddApatow @EPA Unfoetunately, not a shock. Fits in with the rest of his scary picks.
Does Whitehouse really think the public will be "shocked" with this choice? That's why this is all so sad.
@JuddApatow @EPA Sir u seriously need alotta help mentally I feel sorry for the people of Rhode Island,its u thats the poison
@JuddApatow @EPA Anthony Wiener still taking horse back rides for being a chimo?,ugh huh your people,& u bag on Trump lmmfao
@BJGoldsmith @EPA it's a train wreck we must watch now.  Nothing we can agree upon to make change yet
To be fair, it's hard for Trump to even *find* people stupider than he is to pant along after him.
Not all that shocked :( @SenWhitehouse @JuddApatow
@SplendentSweven @EPA We are not shocked.  We are appalled and angry.
@EricIdle @EPA If nothing he did and said before election shocked his voters, why now? The american people has chosen
@EricIdle @EPA Nothing Trump does would surprise me any more - he's already a bottom dweller in the pond of life
.@SenWhitehouse @eqracer Americans worry about what kids eat, but not what they breathe or drink? Not about the climate in a mere 50 years?
Not shocked, Mr. Senator, we expect it. Both those of us who oppose it and his supporters that seem to want to blow it all up. Disheartening
I don't think any of us are surprised. We expect idiocy.
@EricIdle @EPA Indeed. We are appalled by this choice.
whiny Libs. I love it
@EricIdle @EPA They aren't paying enough attention to be shocked.
@MaddowBlog @EPA Not really, more in sadness about him factually living up to expectations.
@EricIdle Trump is disappointed in lifestyle downgrade + financial control he's giving up. EPA? DJT doesn't care. #GotWater?
Back to Anne Gorsuch and James Watt. Insanity.
@EricIdle @EPA not likely, mate.
@ACNewman @EPA I'm sure the American ppl don't care (they should, but they don't)
@MaddowBlog @EPA most American voters are ignorant to what is happening in their world unless it's in a sound bite
nope, not shocked at all. my expectations werent very high to begin with. in fact, I expect worse to come.
@MaddowBlog @EPA obviously the world is over right? Cause only leftists can run the world. So 
I'm not shocked at all!!! I think it's wonderful. Far better than Jackson & McCarthy. I DO NOT trust EPA currently.
@igob4u2 @EPA I'm upset but not surprised. Please keep speaking out. He will dismantle so much positive forward movement.
@MaddowBlog @EPA doesn't believe in climate change---gets EPA job.hates public schools---gets education job.etc,etc.
@MaddowBlog @EPA The citizens of USA demand that Congress stands up to DT and do everything possible to block confirmations
@MaddowBlog @EPA no I'm not shocked at all .he is a monster.who will pick the absolute worst people possible. #notmypresident
@Watchdogsniffer @EPA Never underestimate the gullibility of a brainwashed populace to willfully drink the poison.
shocked but not surprised. Not surprised because Congress will approve him. shocked how little we cherish our nation  @EPA
I'm an American person and I'm shocked you are a senator
At least we can be hopeful Senator
@Martina @EPA if you ever had any interest for your health you should have changed your health system long ago.
counting on you to lead the resistance against climate change deniers actually getting the job.
Clear assault to environment: Trump names OK AG Scott Pruitt -suing EPA on climate change- to head the EPA.
@ret_ward @EPA you don't know Trumpists that well, do? They're stupid enough to believe they won't be impacted.
@maddowblog Many will be but many T rump followers are ignorant about EPA responsibilities
How is your health care package Senator? Not Obamacare is it? How much is your pension for one term Senator? Complaints?
Only if we are using "shocked" the way Claude Raines did in Casablanca.
@BanjoHfuhruhur @EPA Sadly Trumpies go along with whatever he says, whatever he does, whoever he appoints.
@Martina @EPA Shocked? We're anesthetized with morphine to deal with the pain already man. Where have you been?
@MaddowBlog @EPA No surprise unfortunately! Someone shd hold him down n force feedhim polluted water he causes!
With all due respect, senator... You must be new.
@MaddowBlog @EPA 
Confirmed against environmentalists.
Appointees are simply the result of whom is true supporters of him.
@MaddowBlog @EPA after all his other shitty picks, why would this one shock? They all are supremely horrifying.
Obviously, we weren't, as we elected him.  Why should anything else shock us?
Ultimately -- we're getting exactly what we asked for and deserved -- well, 49.x% of us, anyway.
You would have thought the American people would have been shocked by Trump's behavior before now.
Thanks for your support for EPA, @SenWhitehouse!
I hope you and your colleagues will make the convincing case and then block him. Our lives depend on it.
@MaddowBlog @EPA not shocked.He has picked people that are going to destroy our country, our people our resources.He is a pig
Don't forget this bit of well-documented corruption:

https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/us/politics/energy-firms-in-secretive-alliance-with-attorneys-general.html …
Trump & cronies want max profit, no risk, today. Enviro, Health & Safety be damned. CONGRESS MUST STOP HIM NOW.
@MaddowBlog @EPA they won't believe it, he only mentions maddog to them, not all the Goldman Sachs folks. They don't believe
@MaddowBlog @EPA you expect correctly.
@MaddowBlog @EPA Only the parts of the US public that think science isn't a dirty word.
Lol. Nobody following this election would be shocked. Fits all his stated positions on current environmental policy.
Why would they be "shocked"... We KNEW this is who Trump is and that he's not going to do anything to help environment
@MaddowBlog 
They won't be shocked. These are same people who elected a psychopath
I don't think there is much we can do about it senator.  You on the other hand.......
@MaddowBlog @EPA The rubes won't unfortunately.
Fear not, we rubes will clean up the mess you enlightened Moonies have left behind.
@MaddowBlog @EPA No...Selections made so that shutting down HUD and now EPA justified. Not surprised in the least
@MaddowBlog @EPA Everyone Donald has picked so far is unqualified so no ..this is not shocking.
No, we're not shocked. Typical @realDonaldTrump disdain for Americans.
yes, shock and horror.
best pick yet!!!   Go Trump!  Drain the swamp on all this fake science bullshit.
tell that to your children while they starve, burn, etc.
I am old enough to remember all the nonsense 40 years ago.  A farce.  Lies.
If we are wrong (we're not) what have we done? Created cleaner air and water, good jobs, new economic opportunity...
he is ABSOLUTELY the worst fit! May as well have appointed an oil derrick or frac pump.
We didn't?
call @POTUS to ban oil and gas drilling before he goes also make Stading rock a national monument before he goes.
This can't happen.
We are shocked that you are a Senatke and have no resigned. Incompetent.
