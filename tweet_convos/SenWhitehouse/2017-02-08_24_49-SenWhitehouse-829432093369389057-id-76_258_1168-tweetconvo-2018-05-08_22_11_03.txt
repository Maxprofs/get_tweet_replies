Good, but can you make sure your fellow Democrats don't go soft on Scalia 2.0.
A brilliant legal originalist who pulled reasons out of his ass to put incompetent Bush in WH.
Ah, you're the sort of chap that gets his opinions from others. Run along now.
@SenateDems thank you
looks like Pence will just make sure these jerks keep getting in. Losing faith fast, Senator. #murderingourcountry
@kathyprojo when EXACTLY did Holder or Lynch stand up to Obama? I'll wait.................
12 hours, still waiting. Nothing there,huh?
Thank you senator and to all who voted no and held the floor. Sessions will definately not be an independent A.G.
@SenateDems Thank you from Oklahoma my voice isn't heard your efforts are appreciated Standing w/you
@PatToomey @BenSasse Update on how the racists are celebrating the confirmation of Jeff Sessions as Attorney General.
The fight lives on! Good job @SenateDems We must win back seats for parity @HouseDemocrats @TheDemocrats @OfficialCBC

@SenateDems Too late. He has been sworn in. Hope is acts like Lynch did with Obama. She followed n lock step to him.
@SenateDems thank you for standing up for democracy! Looking forward to 2018 when the dems will take the house!

Sessions will not apply the law equally among all Americans.

@SenateDems Hack. You're a joke. A partisan hack without a true moral compass.
