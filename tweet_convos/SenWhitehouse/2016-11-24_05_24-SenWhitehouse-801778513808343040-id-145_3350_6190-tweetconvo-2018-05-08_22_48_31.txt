@PortiaABoulger you should tell your Neolib friend @davidcicilline to speak up; seems right now Goldman has his tongue.
check before you tweet next time.
Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's right to protest must be honored with respect and dignity. This is inexcusable. http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/police-deploy-water-hoses-tear-gas-against-standing-rock-protesters/ …
good. But funny you get right on that but not one person has responded to my multiple tweets or calls re TPP
what's your question on TPP? I'm happy to answer it here.
GREAT! Been calling both offices for months trying to get an answer, but now that it's "dead" I'm not sure it's necessary. 1/2
now that it is dead, and given David opposed TPA in the past, will he refuse to vote in favor of TPA or TPP in the future?
and sorry for my aggravated tone, but I've been looking for answers since before the primaries on this.
no need to apologize. The answer on TPP/TPA is yes, he'll absolutely vote against if it maintains the same deficiencies.
its all illegal. its wrong any leader that gives them money is committing treason.
@kerryreid @TheJusticeDept But trump said water boarding was a good thing right?
Garden variety pest Sheldon Whitestooge is a commie apologist who won't walk his talk @SenWhitehouse @SenSanders

@VanJones68 @TheJusticeDept rarely do I agree with van jones on an issue. But this is one I do. Laramie treaty 1868 is law.
@VanJones68 @TheJusticeDept Sessions wont care about these people's rights. Wake up America. HRC would have-goodbye rights!
@VanJones68 @TheJusticeDept history has not changed bout the native Americans
2 So now the Original Americans are trespassing on its own land. This is insane
@VanJones68 @TheJusticeDept Then do something other than just tweet. C of Eng just issued a public land closure issue
@timoreilly @TheJusticeDept
Any why no pressure from POTUS?
@VanJones68 @TheJusticeDept we treat wild animals better than we treat humans. Humanity is gone.
@VanJones68 @TheJusticeDept Why not equip protesters with GoPros to film everything going on?
@VanJones68 @TheJusticeDept THEY WONT! They're POC! BUNDY's group got food supplies etc while they endangered lives.WHITE PRV
@VanJones68 @TheJusticeDept 
No they won't, at the most someone will tweet.
@VanJones68 @TheJusticeDept curious what initiated the violence. Did protestors do anything to prompt a response?
They are there for the people. Why isn't this government of the people there for them?
Except @TheJusticeDept is Obama's Justice Dept, yeah? https://twitter.com/dee4peace/status/802237314286153728 …

Cramer's biggest donors r oil & gas industry. Ranchers were treated better
ARMY CORPS orders Standing Rock protesters evacuate Dec 5th. Stupid. Obama wants more blood on his hands? Wow
the Standing Rock camps should not be shut down and the police/security involved should be charged
@SenSanders can you go to @WhiteHouse and ask him to save Stading Rock peple will lose every on Doc5 people
Obama said "let it play out."
@SenSanders @TheJusticeDept why is nothing being done about the situation in North Dakota????
Please help our Native Americans.
Thanks. You're the second federal politician to say so.
Thank you, Senator. Are you listening, @POTUS? Are you listening @LorettaLynch? Have you no sense of decency?
@SenSanders @TheJusticeDept
It be a nice change our government actually doing its job by protecting people instead of profits
@POTUS we are still waiting for you to stand up for American citizens--is your Thx Giving speech a travesty?
The Trump crime family has a financial interest in this pipeline and refuses to put an end to it. 
#notmakingamericagreat
gee wonder why the president and vice president elect haven't made an appearance at the pipeline dispute.  Oh wait conflict
Make sure theyre not profiting on you. Put your money in a cred union and boycott Sunoco gas.
@SenSanders @TheJusticeDept
@SenSanders @TheJusticeDept
somehow they got off wall street protests to disappear & mercenaries attacking americans is new norm. Scandal
Pin Lynch down and bend her ear until she agrees to send agents to force Morton County to stand down! #NoDAPL
@SenSanders @TheJusticeDept maybe dopes shouldn't protest?

Call the White House and express your opinions in a forum that might get their attention:
Hostis humani generis - Crimes against humanity
Joseph Salazar from Colorado was there this week end. We need Senators to STAND UP
Nations that suppress peaceful protests with violent force end up with chaos and violence on their hands.
@StageYaneu @TheJusticeDept the DOJ must intervene n help the Indians(the 1st consevationalists) 2STOP that pipeline 4 us all
#NoDAPL

Protesters are being taught how to get arrested, told what to say, forced to think like every1 else. https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1337399006279642&id=100000286663702 …
@SenSanders Wow! Can they trespass do the same on your land?
@drJimQuitsBerni @TheJusticeDept Looking forward to Congress holding a sit in at DOJ to demand justice for #StandingRock
Senator,if you are serious about this i hope you are banding with @SenSanders and rest of Senate 2 force end
what's alarming is this is not on the damn news. The media is hiding it.. you being a senator can change that
they know exactly what's going on and have for quite some time.. like from the beginning. Completely insane!
Yes! So when should The Water protector expect to receive the Humane Treatment? WAY overdue btw!
Great 
Now get Obama to stop the pipeline
Thank you for taking a stand
theres rumors private police are ordering police to tear gas and use flash bangs
would you please call Obama and tell him
They're not going to because they stain the name justice and should be destroyed for it.
@SenSanders @TheJusticeDept Ha,ha,ha. If the Indians were Bank Derivatives they would be saved. Maybe they should get AIG ins
@MSignorile @TheJusticeDept assuming violent treatment will be the expected reaction to any protest for the next 4/8 years
I agree
@SenSanders @TheJusticeDept  @POTUS you need to step in & get this violence stopped. #NoDAPL #NoDAPL
@SenSanders @TheJusticeDept @POTUS you need to step in & get this violence stopped. #DAPL
