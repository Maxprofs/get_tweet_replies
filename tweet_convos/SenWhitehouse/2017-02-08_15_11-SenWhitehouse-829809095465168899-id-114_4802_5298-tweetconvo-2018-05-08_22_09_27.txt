@sherrilee7 Nothing but Conflict of Interest & Corruption from all Trumps picks how can we stop this fleecing of America?
Hillary lost... get over it !
@MAHAMOSA @jk_rowling @EmmaKennedy pleas share this clip to ppl can see the concerns about this man and his previous links to coal+gas
None of his picks add up! How is this one any different?
confirmation will bring him out of his rat hole and may lead to putting him behind bars.
@MAHAMOSA get rid of this guy

This stinks just like his pick!
Not to be a Debbie-downer, but nothing has added up so far...
@MAHAMOSA I am astonished at the lack of responsibility of the Republican Congress.
last 8 years and counting...
time for term limits and time to vote them out.
Of course it adds up, Trump wants to destroy the Federal Gov and World Order as we know it. @ACLU @teigland_cindy
do you folks realize he has lawsuits pending against the EPA & hates the EPA has no desire to protect our environment or water or air
@MAHAMOSA Nothing adds up with trump.:/
I fully support ACLU's suit over this frightening situation, but sadly, it appears to be par for the course.
@ACLU this ad needs to be updated!
Take it from an Oklahoman, his "job" was to destroy EPA in Oklahoma. He fought EPA's rules/regs to benefit the oil/gas industry.
people in Kansas and Oklahoma who have constant earthquakes can tell about Pruitt would not do anything about fracking
I know, he's a jerk. Republicans are talking about shutting down EPA & DOE. He seems to only care about DOD $$.
@ungaggedEPA  this is a big deal. We need to pay attention to this. Those in OK can shed some light.
So glad you're here and working.
nothing adds up w this regime.
EPA should be terminated along with DOE and HUD.
there is a scary pattern with all these nominees & Republicans willingness to confirm. All have records that hurt Americans. Be afraid
@MAHAMOSA this person should be disqualified immediately!!
@SoulFlyTry everything thus far walks like a duck... talks like a duck...and they keep...
@ungaggedEPA Does Pruitt know EPA does not stand for Environmental Pollution Agency.
@ungaggedEPA You can say that again! Pruitt is wrong guy. The picks for #2 at EPA are also interesting. NC former DEQ chief or indstry
what does it matter, the Rep. party is in Trumps pocket. They would not say no to The Devil himself.
cry harder, there are still more rubes with money to give
Lady Liberty @ACLU this one's got me running for my credit card. Thank you!
that statement goes for all his picks. Smh
that's bad news. !!
he really needs to be blocked, the planet might not be able to take what he intends to allow those companies to do, US nature will die
wow not wow
what's disheartening is how republicans don't look at facts concerning the environment. They vote with their pockets
you people need to sue Trump's administration for being illegitimate. Rigged Democratic primaries & Clinton gave us Trump #Wikileaks
Your caption has privilege spelled incorrectly.
they should have all the facts, but it won't matter. Didn't matter for DeVos or Sessions, won't matter now.
@MikeOkuda at last. Somebody's doing something.
But doesnâ€™t the @SenateGOP want to ditch the EPA regs anyway? Another DeVos dummy post!
What does this have to do with defending civil liberties?
@LatinosMatter @realDonaldTrump here we go again, another + to the DTswamp who only cares about money for himself &family
@WhitfordBradley 
#SwampCabinet
Hear what former EPA head, Christine Todd Whitman has to say about this today on The Costa Report! http://ksco.com  @ 2 pm PST!
@StephenLyon5 Nothing about this administration adds up
.@ACLU Ask if those folks in OK/KS/TX w/ increasingly frequent fracking earthquakes are happy with his work as Atty. Gen. for OK.
Uninsuring older Americans, drowning Miami. It's like Trump is trying to find a dozen plagues for U.S. (SNL Fights Back)
"Pesky" FOIA requests won't be such a problem once the [Easy] D of J "upgrades" to fax & snail mail requests ONLY.#PonyExpressFOIA
"Are you SURE you sent it? We've looked EVERYWHERE. Oh well, you'll just need to send another ."
looks like we're gonna have to send everything certified mail 
another of trumps cronies.
does it even matter what his conflicts of interest are? DeVos vote tells us no.
@miraschor   Criminals and devious bad people Republican parasite culture loves
@chellenelson17 #Trump pick(s) NONE of them (and I can't stress this enough), not a God Damn one, add up!

Maybe he's a terminator?!
sent in time to appoint the worst clown Car of a presidency ever (while acting like a buffoon & bully in the process).
And yet the GOP senators DO NOT CARE and will vote him in.
@iamfonda CPA's take offense to you using the term "add"!
Keep up the good work guys! 
I guess they found the guy that produces the air in the swamp Trump's 'cleaning up.'
this is a much watch @SpeakerRyan #RepublicansForSale
thank you for fighting for Mother Nature as tirelessly as you fight for American people. We will keep donating to you 
Call it as it is. It ALL adds up" coordinated an attack on our Democracy; alt-elected coup attempting to reform our society.
Took millions will AG in OKLAHOMA from BIG OIL to allow illegal drilling, to look the other way!
thank you!
Does it matter
Elections Have Consequences

#BernieWouldHaveWon
@ACLU
Putting someone like him in charge of THE WORLDS environment is like me giving Ted Bundy a knife after he promises he wouldn't kill me
What doesn't add up is Democrat Senator votes to stop Pruitt.
@colinmeloy   But isn't there reports saying that wiggy and Co. are gonna close EPA?
@SenCortezMasto @mmpadellan @KevinDarryl @SenWarren @SenSchumer Why has he NOT filed papers? He's ignored FOIA! WRONG 4 EPA! #Resist
How is it legal for everyone in gov to hide their papers?? Is there not a law prohibiting this stuff when running for office??
@MAHAMOSA if therapy "sessions" n devious got through u think EPA gonna get stopped?   nope. Bunch of hot air balloons.
Why bother waste time ...you have zero power over his confirmation ...
get to of him!!!
#perdue #isakson
this is totally shady anyone can see that
seriously glad I donated. Thanks for this.
@POTUS @VP @HalfOnionInABag @MoreVotesMatter Sessions should not be approved until documents are brought forward - transparency now!
are you ready to defend noaa for cooking the data for climate change hoax?
. He is a snake. Always has been always will be.
@SenateDems @SenateGOP #AnotherDumpPick #VoteNoOnPruitt or answer 2 constituents #NextElection We r determined 2 hold u accountable
just another addition to the swamp cabinet
I keep saying this, underqualified people can't get in Trump's way, that's why he keeps choosing them.
They are all dishonest #Hippocrites
as bad as he has been for OK think of the damage he can do on a national stage.
Scott Pruitt is like if you took a serial killer and put them in a HR position. #fire_the_fool #ResistTrump

I love the office. 
"WHERE ARE THE TURTLES?!?!" -Michael Scott, The Office.
haha hands down best of Michael Scott
Anyone else notice all these guys look exactly the same? It's harrowing how Aryan they are. I can't tell them apart.
release your emails before you get voted on Scott Pruitt. Answer the Freedom of Information Act before you try to lead EPA
Share this everywhere.
Trump administration doesn't require experience or law abiding members? They all seem so comfortable hijacking this country..big 
As seen from the get-go, Crooks in the company of Crooks. Don't  expect anything *hopeful* to change. It will only come 2018
Kindly Follow Back Please?! Join us!!! @ACLU
Asked and answered.
the EPA is going to face the same fate as Education. That's why it his conflicts of interest doesn't matter. 45 wants it gone.
another fox guarding the henhouse
Something doesn't add up? How is this appointment any different from the other cabinet appointments?
YESSSSSSSSS! SHARE!
Business as usual in the Trump Administration
the spelling of privilege for a start !
