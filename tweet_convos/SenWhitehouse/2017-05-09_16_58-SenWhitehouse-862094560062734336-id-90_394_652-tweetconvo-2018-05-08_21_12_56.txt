That's you! We must #impeachTrumpnow @SenJackReed
If our Republican Legislators do not appoint a independent investigator they will be aiding/abetting the President's treason with Russia
Mike’s side-kick Dana Rohrabache, while Mike Rogers (GOP MIch) was Congressional House Intelligence head, came out  pro-Russia
Trey Gowdy....let the prosecution of hypocrite democrats begin....drain the swamp, fill the prisons!  R.I. can be a penal colony!
I will tweet u everyday until you & dems get trump & crooked family out of the White House! All of them! This is so disgusting ! Impeach!
Please demand an independent special prosecutor. Please.
After firing Comey Trump is a national security threat. We need an independent prosecutor or let's jump to the chase--impeachment.
You are a fool, if you think the Whitehouse or WE THE PEOPLE, aren't fed up with the whining Propaganda,as Dem/Socialist try to get on track
To that end, how about a follow up to your query where Comey testified: "no way they could review the volume of information?"
In early 2000 RU began placing in office Michigan  GOP Congressmen favorable to them.
We need a Senate select committee to look into this affair.
Independent prosecutor....we can't trust the majority.
Democrats don't trust Republicans? Pot calling kettle black? What a profound idiot!
Rogers is a dangerous selection 4 head of FBI. Mike is close 2 the Romney family, who in turn, R deeply involved with high-level Russians

I would ask as one of your constituents 

Block any action on trump agenda

Until special prosecutor appointed
#PaulRyanIsACoward #VeteransAgainstRyan #VeteransAgainstTrump #VeteransAgainstSessions #FakeChristians
Independent Prosecutor and commission now!
This action required an independent investigator into trump/Russia ties, now.  Thanks.
How do investigative committees get appointed? By DOJ, GOP? They are biased and will not proceed. What is plan B?
Please call for a #SpecialProsecuter ! Please ask your colleagues to do so as well! #Trumprussia @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP
@MatiasFmatias @WhiteHouse #SpecialProsecutor is needed so docs can be under subpoena. 
#TheWorldisWatching #TrumpRussia
Your brand of idiocy could only survive in R.I.!
wow - a lot of delusional people writing on your twitter
Whitehouse is not under investigation unless you mean Oblunder's Whitehouse. Fast and Furious, ranson, uranium, benghazi, emails, on and on
Russian Ruse!!! Fake Narratives!!! Get your head out of the sand
Independent investigation.  Do not let up.  DO NOT. LET UP.
Ur defense of Rosenstein last night was sickening and shameful.
@IndivisibleTeam @ScienceMarchDC @womensmarch @SenateDems @taxmarch @MarchForTruth17 Shut. It. Down. #ShutItDown
Consider today in context of entire timeline from, say, Trump's birther claims?
Please, Senator do something about this! #russiagate investigations effectively squashed. Democracy in danger when Senate does nothing!
BODY ELECT - COUNTRY BEFORE PARTIES Enough pretty words, song & dance + self preserving. Someone rally the body elect & STANDUP for us ALL
First Preete Bharara, then Sally Yates and now Comey... whoever trump brings in will be there to serve him!
To SQUASH Trump/Russia! Why?!?
Please don't b so quick to excuse Ron Rosensteins MOTIVE 4 Firing Comey.  You are assuming a Trump appointee- is not USING Comeys missteps-
I'm scared.  Things spiraling out of control.  What happens now?
Sheldon, you rock. From now on so many FBI leaks the ship is sinking, as the rats leap off, Chaffetz, Nunes, Flynn, Mannafort...
Senate should act now. Congress seems complacent while our country is being led by a man who is out of control. It's disheartening, at best.
Independent prosecutor sir. It's the only way now.
As a R.I. Voter I am asking you please, please, get his crooked ass!  Impeach!
Does not change anything, look up your fact, just someone new doing better job. Nothing stopped
We need an independent investigation please. 
#WeNeedAnIndependentCommission #WeNeedASpecialProsecutor
The whole basis for Comey's firing uses direct quotes from material prepared by the Clinton campaign @maddow
The GOP has the power to stop Trump. They need to do the right thing, right now. End this nightmare.
Yes it is illegal for an admittedly "recused" AG to violate his sacred public pledge to American people not to participate!!!
Great Job on MSNBC!
I know as ranking mem of jud subcomm you want to get to the bottom of things but pls call for independent investigation. Nation deserves it.
Try focusing on healthcare and tax reform first.
you are on the committee... don;t let Republicans shut it down! demand documents before they are burned
We need an independent prosecutor!
Why, because someone will do better job? What a waste of money, out come will be the same.
Sen Whitehouse continue your pursuit of truth no matter where it leads. Are we not a democracy - this is an abuse of power & raises ?s.
It is time to start impeachment process. This is obstruction of justice and Trumps actions are leading us towards a civil war or world war.
And how does Sessions recommend this when he was supposed to have recused himself from the Russian investigation?
They're finally talking about it on the news.
Can you start on that now please! Thx, America
We will make the Women's March look like a knitting circle if not.
Step it up. NOW!
Time for a Special Prosecutor, don't you think, Senator?
He needs to be impeached!!!
#tool
Please please keep up the fight for justice ! Trump is so GUILTY !!
Based on what evidence?
Jack Posobiec Amazing to be in this room - great moment for – at James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
PT is cleaning House so he's not Impeached. He wants to be surrounded by "yes people"...do as I say.
This is an arbitrary use of power!! Bizarre stuff afoot.
Yes!
Typical Coups-day afternoon in Trumpistan...this is getting out of control.
We are entering coup territory!
yea like how many Clinton crimes is he covering up? What do the Weiner emails say? Filed under Life Insurance...
The question is why didn't we have some sort of safety net for this. We give POTUS absolute authority?
We are losing confidence.
