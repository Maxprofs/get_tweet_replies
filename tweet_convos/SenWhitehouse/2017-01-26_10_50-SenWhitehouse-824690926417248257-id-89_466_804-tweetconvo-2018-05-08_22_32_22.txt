@NancyJillfrank2 @nytimes Its worse She is deer in headlights stupid Thinks $$ will get her appt Stand up Congress
@SenSchumer we're ranked 17th worldwide. Our educators have failed us! We need to go a different direction. Any direction!
detroit is in bad shape because of the Democrats
@SenSchumer @nytimes demon devil commie party has failed children 4 many yrs. Time 2 start thinking about children not union
How could anyone be against charter schools!!!
@SenSchumer 

Detroit Public School

Yep. Those are mushrooms growing from a classroom wall.
@SanFranMoman @nytimes

Vote No on DeVos. Choice means segregation by race/ religion/ income. Schools shouldn't be for-profit; should be to educate.
Public money so you can isolate your kids by or from religious views, race or other criteria is segregation.
comparing education to Slavery? That is tasteless, thoughtless & demonstrates no understanding of history.
Hitler used slave labor in his war factories. Jews, gays, gypsies. Blacks were taken from Africa and sold. That is slavery.
Betsy DeVos is the failed American education's last and best hope for the future!
@SenSchumer @nytimes 

When teachers in Red State Indiana are protesting DeVos, you know she is the worst person for the job!
but do you think they care?  No!  People wake up!!
Profit is not the correct goal of  US Public Educational System.Vouchers are a canard of school choice.
@SenSchumer @nytimes Tell your colleagues NO TO ALL NOMINEES.NOTHING LESS!
School choice for the rich, but not for everyone else.  School choice for ALL Americans.
please sits do not confirm.
For the love of all things, please stop her. Our children deserve better
But you won't fail Children. Thank you Sen. Whitehouse. Is anything "extreme" good for children and their parents?
@SenSchumer @nytimes This woman cannot be in charge of #publiceducation #noWaynoHow #RESISTANCE
@realDonaldTrump u should get out more
Public schools are a Common Core dumbdown tax payer rippoff. Go Go Betsy DeVos.
@SenSchumer @nytimes  And the old union way killed the city and the only winners were the teachers union. Kids lost.
DeVos is the worst choice for Sec of Education. She nor her children ever went to public school.
@SenSchumer @nytimes having a choice works better gets rid of useless teachers that are worthless
@SenSchumer BTW, how much are the teachers unions donating to your campaign?  Sheldon?  Chuckie?
If you're on that committee please vote NO please please please
Sure, it's much better to let bureaucrats & unions dictate kids' education, instead of parents. Typical fascists.
democratic city with under achieving public schools with a strong union holding children back. same ole.
And see what's happening in Los Angeles just yesterday? Scams & rackets.

@SenSchumer Detroit is failing because of liberal control
@SenSchumer @nytimes maybe because she had to follow bad laws
Please vote her out. She is a danger to our children.
Education is too important to let DeVos wreck it and turn it over to for-profit companies. #kidsmatter
@SenSchumer @nytimes Betsy Devos would make the worst Ed. Sec'y. in history. THANK YOU for your opposition to her nomination.
@SenSchumer And that's why we expect all Dems to vote her down. DeVos is a train wreck.
@SenSchumer Detroit- not her life- not her people
that is true, but look at all the grizzly bear attacks she prevented. #grizzliesagainstdevos
@SenSchumer not all charter schools are successful and not all public schools fail. Great teaching by great teachers key
@SenSchumer @nytimes And she has yet to be sworn in yet!
Get use to being in the Minority Pal! Your gonna be there a while!
she's failed the charters in Michigan. That's been her job. It's not audacity. It's truth
@SenSchumer @nytimes Audacity to say that the incoming Edu Sec has something to do with Detroit Detroits Kids,
@SenSchumer @nytimes Gotta hand it to you,  you represent a party that's been running Detroit for 40 yrs and you have the
please do not vote for this horrible choice to head the education department, please convince republicans to see the obvious
@SenSchumer @nytimes the liberals that run Detroit are the ones that have failed the children.
"EXTREME"........LOL what BS

other cities such as NYC, Chicago, Baltimore have had great success with the Public School system. Wait, no thy haven't.
My adopted son 6 IEP's, now college FT/ work 30 hrs/wk pays his share = great public schools/teachers/ADA!!!!!
Senator please protect our children's constitutional right to a free public education. #devoscharterqueen
Ineffective? She's only had the job a couple of days.
she doesn't have the Ed secretary job. She's been working in michigan.
Then please vote NO!!! The majority of your constituents want you to vote no!!! Thank U senator.
You should also check out how poorly her husband's charter is doing in Detroit.
@SenSchumer  Hoping you all make sure to block her!!!
@SenSchumer @nytimes keep fighting for some sanity!! Do not let them get away with this crap!! I am a retired teacher.
Student I got from charter schools were always behind my public school students!  Check the stats from Ohio to see what Charters do to kids!
@SenSchumer @nytimes DeVos beyond belief unqualified. Clueless to public ed. And now against Fed IDEA? VOTE NO!!
Can't win them all so now get working on 3 Republicans to flip to defeat #BetsyDeVos
@SenSchumer @nytimes DeVos beyond belief unqualified. Clueless to public ed. Hearings embarrassing. And now against Fed IDEA?
@SenSchumer @nytimes no surprise there. @BetsyDeVos is not qualified to lead.
@SenSchumer @nytimes Does not one see the connection between under funded urban public schools and increase in crime.
@SenSchumer Please stop her confirmation and find Republican colleagues who will vote "No DeVos" as well.
VOTE NO
@SenSchumer @nytimes Thanks for standing up.
It's worse than that. cc: @ReaderAdrift
@SenSchumer @nytimes chucky you take money from teacher unions
@SenSchumer You are assuming she has interests other than profit.
Facts such as that mean nothing to this new administration. #alternativefact

@SenSchumer @nytimes SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A NIGHTMARE HERE IN MICHIGAN...HE'LL NO TO HER!
@SenSchumer @nytimes stop her!!
So can we count on you to vote NO on DeVos?
Agreed! Extremely dangerous to public ed. What else can I, a RI voter, do to stop her confirmation?  #NoDevos
Can your constituents take this to mean you will not vote "yes" to confirm DeVos?
Then you better fight tooth and nail against her and all the others.
.@SenWhitehouse @nytimes  and it'll fail children  in #RhodeIsland so pls vote no on her confirmation.
@HouseDemocrats No pick & choose-Save the goddamned country, & maybe even your own skins, - fight ALL the battles.
