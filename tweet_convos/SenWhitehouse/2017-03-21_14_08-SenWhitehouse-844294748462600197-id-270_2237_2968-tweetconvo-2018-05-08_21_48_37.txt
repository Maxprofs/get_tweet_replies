#Gorsuch is America's worst nightmare. The lobbyists and corporations are paying to support him for a reason.
it's snowflakes worse nightmare a judge that actually follows the constitution omg in fathomable!!!!
"in fathomable" eh?
LMAO!
Unfathomable. Nice to have a ass chuckle over a auto correct. Happy 4 you!!!
@SenateDems glad I moved out of RI to distance myself from this clown of clowns political hack.  No clue
Gorsuch sounds to me exactly like a performer/politician. The awshucks stuff doesn't hide his considerable vanity.
that song "smooth operator" keeps playing in my head when I hear him speak!
Very sad that Gorsuch's fake folksy self-satisfied schtick plays so well in America 2017
@hlthiskrieger transparency is their enemy. Ethics committee is their enemy. Intelligence committee is their enemy. All this
why even ask the question if you do not have any actual proof of this "dark group?" Stop the madness! #ConfirmGorsuch
I agree, stop the madness of dark money front groups.
Sad part is, those groups exist among all party lines.
@kimmie8264 this alone is reason to stop proceedings. He's an illegitimate nominee from an illegitimate president. Impeach
If SCOTUS loses legitimacy it could be for 40yrs we can not afford that as a nation it destabilizes us
another reason to halt proceedings at once.
Incorrect. The scotus nominee has the potential to screw up our court for decades.
I get such a feeling of dread about Gorsuch that my stomach actually turns over. This all has to end
you'll be okay, we had to deal with EIGHT YEARS of incompetent goofy leftist thinking.
 NowThe  world's circling th drain
after taking a look at you in have to say you have the form of stupidity that has no cure.
I don't tweet 2 mentally ill
@vaheygirl ...like 10 million, right?
@KatheleenH I know you try to find the truth. No justice.
@Maryfkwc 
Hi Mary
Could you wear this Crown of Glory
http://www.sidroth.org this is awesome
ohhh wait, so now I can pay to get a Supreme Curt judge of my preference. this is so new to me
Thank you 
@nasty_woman2 Let's promise that anyone who votes for Gorsuch and ACHA will end their days in prison.
@Monaca6 I think it's obvious why he wouldn't answer. He knows there isn't one representative alive who would do anything
If he doesn't want to be "political" he shouldn't seek a SC seat. Hypocrites, all of them. Walk out of hearings.
he's seeking SC it's not suppose to be political but a obamas buddy in Hawaii did.
@hlthiskrieger exploit the constitution.
How much did Democrats spend to get you elected? Money foolishly spent.
.@SenWhitehouse You are doing a great job! Keep it up. We need you, #RhodeIsland needs you!
@18_MACHINE Hope you run in 2020
@TnTnTx03 r watch this and notice the faces of the females while he's talking. Senator 
Klobachar at the end.
I noticed that. It must be so hard not to yell out "Bullshit!" during hearings.
don't know if I could do it.
@SedLily judge Gorsuch should not be considered for any position while Mr.Trump is being investigated!!!
You should pass a bill to get money out of politics! 
#Gorsuch will overturn Roe v Wade and destroy women's rights for the next 30 years. He can't be trusted on workers rights
@BTWOM007 Because he's a corporate shill and the US is no longer a republic; it's corporate state.
@owenbernard so they can steal that seat just like they stole the election thieves.
@wildearthguard because they know they can bribe him or he agrees with they're extremest views
Holy F*^#%
@SusanWard2016 @StolenSceptre @damonbethea1  Check this out! Let me know if/when you get it. Wow, the Senator is on fire!
@hlthiskrieger means that D enemy of D president is D people. Those who ask why, those who inquire. Those who know the const-
Totally unacceptable. Democrats should take an ad out to expose this!
all they have to do is call a fake news station. Lol.
@pirateannie16 Any Russian money?
my thoughts exactly. I think the whole GOP has sold out to Russia. They show no concern.
we desperately need Constitutionalist judge to replace Scalia. That wasn't going to happen last year. You don't get it?
Tou must call for impeachment or suffer at the polls.
@hlthiskrieger those who know the constitution. Those that follow the constitution and not those that look for loop wholes &
@hlthiskrieger their some shady stuff going on in D GOP & they know it. I want 2 see how many bailout after they get caught.
Good question Senator. Who is investigating $17 million to get a SC judge they want. #darkmoney
Same way Putin is paying off Trump and his cronies.
Did you get an answer to the 17 million dollar question?
.@SenWhitehouse Justice is only for the highest bidder in GOP's world.
it gets real in these tweets! The twitter investigators will find the dark money & bring it to the light! 
start by researching The Federalist Society!
Go Sheldon!!!
When asked why they'd pay that much for him Gorsuch said to ask http://them.Smart  **ss. No one can because their names are not avail
I would like to know the answer to this too.
is he capable of speaking without a shit eating grin?  His opening statement was an acceptance speech to him...
the real SCOTUS just overturned one of Gorsuch's rulings stripping edu from disabled kids.
Wish you'd ask him EASY Y or N questions. Use his lack of candor&refusal to answer as basis to walk out on #Vote. #Answers
thank you for not letting him hide! Your supporters thank you!
So their hostile agenda can pushed through like loose stool
@bythehandofbob I can give you 2 names associated with that group. Rebekah Mercer and Steve Bannon
I was proud of you during your questioning! Excellent points. Keep on fighting! #resist
You should ask George Soros. I think he's a master of this and many dems know him,  maybe you do too.
same questions were asked regarding obama, Reid, and pelosi with no answer. They have done more harm to our nation than SCJ
what an unacceptable and dismissive response from him.
@GypsySpirit46 America  has to get the money out of politics,  3000 max in canada and no corporate
@GeorgeHiggins with reps control of 3 branches, there will be a conservative judge. But important question to answer.
Just ask your DEMOCRATIC colleagues about billionaires  donating $ to campaigns
FYI
CONGRESS 1 makes laws about disclosure
Exactly-hard2see you questioning a man w/integrity in this manner given what we know as FACT-Absurd Hypocrisy
Gorsuch explanation of your questions about "dark money."
https://youtu.be/ZURHD5BU1o8 
We know they are; Koch brothers, Mercers, Devos family..  The usual big spenders that use front groups.
@MarkRuffalo @SenSanders As Gorsuch just said, no one controls him. you need to get voted out.
Great job questioning that wolf in sheep's clothing
Why are groups spending millions in dark money to fight the confirmation of Gorsuch? Are you not aware of that dark money?
you should be the nominee for Supreme Court.And you would not be answering gotcha questions. Try, Do your job,quit interrupt
that alone should be a warning. He's a Trump nominee. He cannot be trusted. #GorsuchHearing
why did black money on demo side spend billions to get obamacare passed.didn't care then did you, not if it's on the far left
You are out of your mind! Term limits!
Dems @SenSchumer @alfranken  sound like bunchOF carpenters in US Senate @DNC @AP @MiceeMouse @katyperry @aplusk @ACTBrigitte
 that was wonderful! Plz do not let Gorsuch have SCOTUS. He is not an honest man. He would be horrible for the US! #Corrupt
@SierraClub Them something stinks!
@SierraClub 
If there is a "front group" spending 17 million to get this guy confirmed
you are insane!
We're getting them all day in OREGON! ?? I assume it's pro-abortion groups, but these days, you never know. 
could be fascists, could be Russians, could be mafia - dark $ bad for US & world. Where'd it come from?
Democrats should get up, and walk right out.
Will Gorsuch actually answer a question or keep playing verbal dodgeball?
EXCELLENT lines of questioning!
He didn't answer your questions at all.
@peterdaou @GMA If using Dark Money, how can Gorsuch claim judgeship isnt political? There's a reason they want him on court.
@brhodes @brianstelter Gorsuch's denial of politics at play in his nomination to court is simply cynical.
Can somebody ask Gorsuch if he knows who the funders are?
@ushadrons so have  colleague ask for you @SenFranken
@MeatballMom2 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
@KaivanShroff No such thing as a free lunch. They expect repayment and would get it if Gorsuch is confirmed.
,
@KaivanShroff I find it hard to believe he doesn't know who'll he be sending the thank you note to.
@kharyp "ask them" that's the holding line. There is always a finger pointing somewhere else.
.@SenWhitehouse Vote no or Confirm Hearings Need 2 stop til Comey/independent investigations done. @SenFranken @SenBobCasey @SenSherrodBrown
Sheldon is a stuffed-shirt working to jail those who dont accept his version of climate change...uggg! @thehill @GoLocalProv
whats being asked of him is not out of the ordinary. Interview w/any big box retailer & honestly they will the same question
so I honestly dont get Y Gorsuch's unwilling 2 elaborate his possible strengths that would make him a better choice 4 employ
almost EVERY employer asks potential employees "Y should I hire U, how can U help my buss,.whats your strength & weakness"?
Excellent question. Thank you for your thoughtful questions.
Why do I get the impression that this pompous, entitled ass will be worse than Scalia?
@jones55_jones A year ago: http://bipartisanreport.com/2016/03/20/mitch-mcconnell-to-fox-news-nra-must-approve-of-new-supreme-court-justice/ â€¦ #GorsuchHearing #RejectGorsuch @DavidYankovich @davidaxelrod @scotus #NRA
thank you!
@kharyp You asking him about the 17 million was EPIC!!
on what?   R u saying legislatots are PAID. for votes.  Elaborate.
@Amatodeb 
Reminds me of the Pelican Brief. 
Sinister
Follow the Money. That cliche never sounded more important than now.
@AlexMorash they want women in back allies with coat hangers and they want dirty air/water and they want to abuse workers lol
@Amoney666 his case file and all his comments, their sicking.
@Amoney666 He a very corrupt judge, he is against disable kids, the LBGT, and Women. Just read
I'm sorry, and what exactly is "dark money".
Silly man, here ya go: some ppl think 1st would b an activist judge and think grosuch wouldnt be. All done. @Firni
Thank you Senator Whitehouse for your strong questioning of Gorsuch.  
You did a great job. Thank you.
WOW. thank you!
Thank you for taking a stand!
The corruption in our government is off the charts.  POTUS, et al under investigation & the agenda moves forward daily.
@NormOrnstein Gorsuch nomination is financed by the Russians, no 2 things abt it. @realDonaldTrump knows it.
@joanwalsh constantly proud of my senator from lil Rhody!
I've never seen ads promoting a SCOTUS nominee before, who are they trying to persuade?  Who/why funding this?
Commercials in Nevada. So weird. And ineffective cuz it's still a stolen seat.
I watched this today, you were impressive, well spoken and right on point, thank you, Sir.
very suspicious
Confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch! Stop acting like babies and GROW UP!!
Dark money? why so concerned? You all wasnt concerned with all the corruption from Obama,and the Clintons!
YES DO THAT. HE DOES LAWS NOT POLITICAL VIEWS. LOOKS LIKE YOU USE HEARINGS FOR YOUR OWN AGENDA OF REPUBLICAN BASHING.
@SenateDems great work today! Gor laughed up pee, animal torture, PTSD, but not dark money. #Filibuster
@slack2thefuture Because...wait for it....FASCISM
@MeatballMom2 well done, sir...  excellent question!  His response was the most pathetic thing I've heard...
@joanwalsh yup!  Been seeing his phony commercials since day after named. Weird
Dark money=dark secrets=foreign influence infiltrating deep into another layer of US government.
thank you for holding them accountable.
@NickRURU Merrick Garland waited over a year and never got a hearing. DONT confirm a nominee from a prez under investigation.
@2020fight Gorsuch denied that he knew any of the people that were supplying the 17 million in "dark money". He denied + lied
@2020fight Can't believe he actually said to pass a law just to get some transparency from him. He better not be confirmed!
@RockyinTX 
Just fyi they are inedating our Florida networks with Gorsuch and 45 book ads on tv here. It's insane!!
Looks like the Mercers are the $$ behind Trump and every political decision he's made, so that'd probably include Gorsuch.
@MTPopulist thank you for pushing the issue Sir! Please keep it up!!
Well he admitted that he was receiving the money!
ASK

@DrTomMartinPhD wish the Dems would answer  with blue money to tell how gosh, golly, awshucks, Gorsach prefers corps over ppl
@joanwalsh keep saying the truth and vote no
@joanwalsh Well asked.
They have an agenda with Putin but don't won't to be known for their collusion
I've seen SO MANY tv commercials promoting Gorsuch & I've never seen ads like that before. ever.
Because our politicians set the standard for accepting big donors money and work for them and not us? Gee, how dare they....
@a35362 
#TheResitance is fighting the opposite! Trump is under FBI scrutiny. GOP are clinging fast to failing #Trumptanic
Tell @SenTedCruz from me, an irrate, informed Texan that he should count his days till Nov. #midterms
Please, for the love of all humanity, vote @SenTedCruz out.
Excellent job senator pandering to your #progressive supporters
Why are you so full of it? Today was my 1st viewing of you. What a hypocrite & a letdown. 100% Owned: You. Pathetic display.
Why can't you? Do you have any evidence that Gorsuch is in on this scheme? Or is this just another political shenanigan?
To even attend this mockery speaks for itself. @Rainbow_Unic0rn
outrageous
@mrspc48 yes I'm sick of the ads.
yea make my head hurts more. All of it makes me sick
I thought I was the only one who had that sick feeling in the stomach thingy going. @mrspc48 @SenWhitehouse
Do it! Ask them.
@joanwalsh on Roe either Gorsuch or Trump seems to be untruthful.  Donald promised to appoint a justice who wants to overturn
Can you smell a BSer a mile away? I can. Keep digging.
@joanwalsh I thought it was strange to see so many pro Gorsuch commercials on TV (metro Atlanta). For a confirmation???
great questions to which we,deserve answers
it's just more of the corruption!
Thanking them for asking that question....whatever chatter he had just to kill time...like he knew he was in, could be a boob
Did Gorsuch answer anything really?  Whenever I turned hearing on he was filibustering, telling about "when I was 9 yo"
.@SenWhitehouse r u seriously asserting that a united states senator cannot get the names and addresses of who's behind these front  groups?
@joanwalsh Keep asking tough questions. It is a form of resistance
@joanwalsh
@joanwalsh Good job.
to be clear Whitehouse won't release his own tax returns,faces insider trading allegations n supports fracked gas plant in RI
@joanwalsh listen to him today. As a woman, not impressed and a little scared
@joanwalsh I would like to know that also I have never ever seen tv commercials for a Supreme Court judge before
@joanwalsh Ask Mercer.

The true culprits: The Federalist Society & The Heritage Foundation. 

#FollowTheMoney
@rih823_hayes go Sheldon!
thank you senator whitehouse. A grateful Rhode Islander
Derp.
@ealight461 He can say anything he wants now but once he is in there is no undoing it.  Stop it now.  Vote no.
great job. Thank you.
good response by the Judge. What does that truthful response tell you Senator?  A shadow group like Obama's shadow government
You're a full-blown loon
he is a pompous ass!!!
So does a large part of America who is following the hearings!
thank you for asking this ,Senator.
@BrianDamien1  Does    Garland endorse Gorsuch? If he does, I'm okay. If he doesn't, he is a pretender.
@smille5884 $$$$$
Its called Roe v. Wade, and Planned Parenthood...I dont know if his confirmation can be stopped but I hope it is...
THANK YOU for asking the right questions.  #RUSSIA!!!  Pls. ask someone to press him on Russian ties!
.@SenWhitehouse Conformation hearings are like job interviews: ppl shade their past, smile & lie abt their true objectives...
@Brookslei Lots of commercials in South Carolina. Strange since 6 of 7 reps are R's and public doesn't vote.
North Carolina, as well.
Why are you always in the unions pockets?
MAKE THE TURTLE McCONNELL USE THE NUCLEAR OPTION.
Pretty accurate assessment I'd say. A bit like watching Ryan and his condescending smirks. UGH!
@Roolbreaker1 Gorsucks. What an arrogant man.
This is what happens with desparate Dems have nothing on the nominee.  They have to bring in irrelevancies.
@SenateDems Dems will find bigfoot before they find anything that would disqualify Gorsuch. Unicorns too.
