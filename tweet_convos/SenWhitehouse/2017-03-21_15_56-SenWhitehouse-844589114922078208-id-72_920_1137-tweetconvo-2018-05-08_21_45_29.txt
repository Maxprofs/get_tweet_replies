Who's buying the Supreme Court? Any guesses??
Citizens United..duh..lol
Or Koch brothers
@SenWhitehouse is a man to be admired.
PRICELESS!
@SenWhitehouse you're an incompetent boob. Gorsuch's character puts your party to shame. Bye dems you're toast!
@sherryrudman1 We must get rid of citizens united. Our government and judiciary is being bought. #resist #TrumpRussia
sounds like it.   Im guessing, since its a bad thing, it was started by Reps so we r stuck until we get maj 
@SenWhitehouse Your kickin Gorusch's ass! Love it!
You should run for prez senator!
sickening #double standard Commie Dimms.
...Scumbags, the whole lot of them
@SenWhitehouse I'm a big fan Senator. You really do your homework and we the people appreciate your service. Carry on sir!
@SenWhitehouse excellent work Senator! Keep going!
giving an example but, if I said I like someone just because they have Idk "gray hair" doesn't mean that person is bad or I am.
how is that relevant?
DAAAAAANG, that's great.
the reason they spend so much on him is because we cannot afford another dipshit libaroid the country's dying fast enough
Oooo, scary stuff. Why didn't we hear all this horror when he was unanimously appointed to appellate court? Oh yeah, no Trump.
@DerekCressman so important. Sen Whitehouse is brilliant and plain  spoken. Respect.
Wow!!!  Just shows how money can buy anything, even a person's inner soul!
You'd have to have a soul first, in order for it to be bought. The #GreedyOligarchyParty has none.
I love how a  congressman who takes money for his campaign from people like Goldman Sachs questions someone about donated money
@SenWhitehouse knows about "Dark Money" as he has received it in the past from @ThortonLawFirm yet hasn't returned it.
Hey hypocrite Sheldon, you wont change the disclosure laws because you do not want Democrat dark money exposed.
If 'dark money' has rigged the system, then you must be aware of its flow. How is it  then 'dark money'?
@SenWhitehouse Knowledge of Dark Money alone should disqualify Gorsuch. 2nd Travesty: Seat belongs to Garland.
@SenWhitehouse my senator 
$17 million seems relatively cheap for a Supreme Court seat, garbage football players cost more than that.
Thank you!!
If you don't know Senator you need to get into another line of work.
Thank you for raising the critical issue - we need much more on that. That dark money is at war with Americans.
@SenWhitehouse advertisements in TV for Gorsuch is shocking and sad! Is the Supreme Court for sale now?  #Americahasbeenhad!
@SenWhitehouse and he didn't answer.
Stellar soundtrack! Bravo!
@diamondfishes @CNNPolitics @ChrisCuomo @WSJ @realDonaldTrump @USATODAY @nytimes @SenFeinstein @LindseyGrahamSC @GOP WOW! GOOD!
@oxfordsemicolon oh he's a great choice for the highest court in our country. He knows who's supporting him $17 million ways!
Whitehouse isn't very bright is he
@DerekCressman I listened all day yesterday and this was absolutely stunning. & I think should be disqualifying. Is it normal?!
wow wow wow!!!!!
Bombshell!
whaaaat
This is some shit.  $17 million to get Gorsuch a seatâ€¦but why? @nowthisnews @sanhotree
Holy Shit!
@nowthisnews
This Senator just grilled Trump's Supreme Court pick over dark money 
@SenWhitehouse #darkmoney NO GORSUCH! Why are they spending so much $$$ on you???#EndCitizensUnited #TrumpRussia #ImpeachTrump
@realJKCallaway golly gosh I just am a judge that does his best 
Judge had best stay clear of the poker table. His twitchy hands are a tell, which also reveals when he's nervous being exposed.
- 
This is fabulous. Hats off to Sheldon Whitehouse.
@ImpactDemocracy who?
huzzah!!
@lmadmamta Oh Sn Ap
Send @JudgeNGorsuch to  @scotusginsburg , she'll chew him up and spit him out!
I know: it's not his fault - and he "regrets" - that things are the way they are...
ASK OBAMA ABOUT CLINTONS MONEY TO HIM!
ALL THE MONEY THAT WENT TO CANADA FOR A FAKE SOFTWARE!
God he walked right in to that too

Keep torch held HIGH & illuminate LIES & deceit of some GOP.
 RT4ever
@DerekCressman WOW
this was a good way to avoid this deflection way is not the way people are.what is it they are hiding behind?? just suspicious of everything
maybe cool it with the jazz?
Seriously, was really distracting.
too bad they ignored the dark money surrounding @HillaryClinton
He's got a nervous tic w/ his fingers when asked tough questions.
I noticed this too. Strange body language gives it away all the time.
I saw that, too.
@DerekCressman Thank you, Senator. @SenWhitehouse
@DerekCressman Wow, get a load of this.
Mr Whitehorse calls out the dark money industrialists like the Koch Brothers deciding whose selected for the Supreme Court BOOM
