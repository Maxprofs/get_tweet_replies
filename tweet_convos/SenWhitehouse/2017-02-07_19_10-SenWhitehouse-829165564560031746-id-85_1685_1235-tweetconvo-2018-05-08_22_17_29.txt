I spoke out about @SenatorSessions – until @SenateMajLdr McConnell decided to silence me. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVyq6kAN6u4 …
So now you support Republicans? Martin Luther King Jr was a die-hard Repulbican along w/ his wife
All of U R whats wrong w/ our country-your obstruction tactics show your true character - inferior!
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr McConnell doesn't care what ppl think. Grow some stones and play hardball.

@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr @SenWarren @SenatorSessions  Let her speak, read the letter!
@SenWarren @SenatorSessions #McConnellsNewMvCarthyism
#letlizspeak
@SenWarren 
SHAMEFUL!!!!!
Rep Congress & Admin hellbent to undo equal, just & clean AmerIca the Beautiful #NoSessions #NoPruitt
McConnell is afraid of Senator Professor AND he's in the good 'ol boys club, protecting one of his own...
Turtle boy needs to retire. Old fascist fossils have nothing to offer.
that's because you don't get mouthy with the duke of the senate. he is the lord of us all, ask him
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr 
The American people are watching @TheDemocrats disgraceful behavior, this is why you lost!!
As a constituent I had the idea that nominees dabete was about judging character
If you look up hypocrite in the dictionary there's a picture of Mitch Mcconnell.
he was the leader of party of NO for 8 years
As an American, I expect you to allow the entire letter be read by Elizabeth Warren.
Calling on all Senators to Boycott Everything in #DisTrumpia, including attendance to Congress. #ForceHimToResign
ur elected to lead, not play race card quit being a whiner.
It never mattered who spoke. Republican minds were made up. Party before country
Obstructing the business of our country is Dereliction of Duty in my book. You're all disgraceful!
Honestly naw I am confused
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr Good job Mitch!
silence her she spews divisiveness and chaos she has an agenda she does not care about the people
If I were you guys id have every Democrat read the letter, let them vote you all silent and see if they can silence you all.
read the letter!
You abide by Senate rules Yet sum1 breaks the rules you throw a tantrum, but spent no time beforehand objecting to said rule
@kohlmeyerhyman @SenateMajLdr Thank you so much!!!
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr unacceptable and just shows @SenateMajLdr true lack of character
Let the words of Corretta Scott King regarding "Nominee" Sessions be heard and #LetLizSpeak
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr McConnell and the Gop don't won't truth.
@DuleHill @SenateMajLdr Apparently none of you believe in rules. It's not her first day in the Senate.
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr Democrats don't understand you must follow rules. Geez folks. Rules aren't just for your underlings
Elizabeth Warren should go away. Her, Bernie, Nancy, and Chuck are menaces to our Democracy.
Another egg with 4 followers. Block all eggs.
@SenWarren @SenatorSessions THANK YOU for standing up for our senator!
Let Liz speak this debate is about a Sessions as Attn Gen not about being a senator  We the people deserve more
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr She must be really scaring the big bad @SenateGOP! #LetLizSpeak
@PlainMushroomWt @SenateMajLdr #LetLizSpeak
so silence is the way you will push him thru #LetLizSpeak
Bullying, becoming a GOP trademark! Sessions is now a "nominee"not a senator can't be both! Violation overruled
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr follow the Senate rules for conduct, is that too much to ask?
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr Yes, another uppity liberal Yankee woman! Way to get her in line-impugned by Coretta Scott King...

Incredible abuse of power!! McConnell needs to be thrown out of office!
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr @SenWarren @SenatorSessions Sen. Sessions you can drop being AG.

@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr @SenWarren @SenatorSessions @YouTube #LetLizSpeak
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr EVERY D Senator needs to STAND UP AND TAKE A TURN READING CSKing's LETTER ABOUT JBS. GOP disgusts.

@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr **STOPSESSIONS**
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr @SenWarren @SenatorSessions @YouTube of line. U know u would have done same thing if it was ur pick
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr @SenWarren @SenatorSessions @YouTube
this needs to stop.  Representatives put on notice we will not back down & vote 2018&2020
@SenateDems @SenateMajLdr @SenWarren @SenatorSessions @YouTube 1/2 Proud of McConnell for doing his job. Warren was way out
@SenateGOP American People are watching. Stop muzzling people and allow them to speak.
so is he saying that no one can say anything bad about Sessions even when true? Why have hearing?
Let her speak!  How dare you, I will say it, Sessions/racist/unfit!
Tweeting does nothing. Call the bastard.
Thank you for leading the resistance to this deplorable ruling!  #Resist
@SenWarren wasn't impugning "Senator" Sessions, she was speaking of "Nominee" Sessions. Technically not a violation of rules.
committed no violation of Senate rules. Yet another example of creeping fascism in USA.
go to the floor, read the letter.
