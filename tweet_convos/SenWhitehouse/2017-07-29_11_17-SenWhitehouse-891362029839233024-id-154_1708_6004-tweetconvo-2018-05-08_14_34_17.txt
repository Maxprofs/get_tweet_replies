If the Senate Democrats ever got the chance, they would switch to a 51 majority vote in first minute. They are laughing at R's. MAKE CHANGE!
BTW yesterday's health care vote was to 51 because Republicans used "reconciliation." No 60-vote cloture involved.
he has no idea what you're talking about?
Oh he is whining!? He thought he was winning. He gets confused easily
He has a deep fear of being laughed at, not laughed about, but, laughed AT. And he projects that onto others.
Creepy billionaires whine when they don't get their way, @SenWhitehouse.

Thank you for standing up for the ACA and the people.
Typical bully, hitbhim and he whines or sues you.
This man is a disgrace to our democracy, nation&citizens who really care about this country . His behavior is disturbing & needs to stop
Dems had a much larger majority in  congress and only shoed respect for the process and democracy!

You tell him! #whinerinchief #NotMyPresident Seems to think nothing is beneath him.
The only change thats needed
@realDonaldTrump STOP WHINING YOU SOUND RIDICULOUS
Ahem!!!
Thomas Jefferson wrote the Senate filibuster rule. Harry Reid & Obama killed it yesterday.  Rule was in effect for over 200 years.


u should know by now, that is what he does best @POTUS is out of his league n such a disgusting person
Thank you for standing up to him. Now to rally the rest of them to do likewise
Divider in chief and poor looser. What's wrong with bi-partisan.
This here is how you get re-elected folks!
No no please, let him keep doing this.
My favorite tweet ever by an elected official. If you and I weren't married I would propose. 
Don-the-Con=Laughing Stock
No not really @realDonaldTrump we're laughing at you and the little trumpettes You will always be remembered as the joke the world has known
Stirring the pot
So, I think Mr Whitehouse belongs in the White House! He's showing himself to be a tough progressive who really "gets" it!
Yep. Should have been Clinton VP, big mistake.
Agree! That would have been awesome!
Also, as I would not be the first to point out, ifTrump had the faintest idea what was going on: Health care bill failed 49-51.
you were quoted in a story by @washingtonpost
@realDonaldTrump  Kicking your highchair again?!? Grow up. 
He's too ignorant to realize it wouldn't have helped him anyway, SAD!!!
Trump learn a little history and respect the traditions of our government.
Haven't you been paying attention...nothing is beneath him.
He whines, he bullies, then he completely denies anything he said.
Don't try to teach trump political history;it's WAY too late!
Nothing is beneath this POTUS
He talks about so much winning, but he really means WHINING. HE is beneath a POTUS & has no business being in WH with his scum. HE MUST GO.
@realDonaldTrump is like a mosquito, annoying tiny insect buzzing around your ear.
Not THIS POTUS
Doesn't he understand that by switching 2 a 51 majority would allow a Congress flipped blue, cuz he has ruined Rs, to write their own laws
If I could like and retweet this 1000 times I would....
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT !!!!
@realDonaldTrump lied again? Say it ain't so! /s
It's not beneith this one, it's a daily occurrence with him. #PoutUs
He knows that but feeding his followers with his KoolAid.
@realDonaldTrump That is the way you think Donald, Democrats are not as shady as Republicans.

I don't believe he can stop. He's gotta point to someone else to mask his own incompetence
Whining, lying, breathing . . . they're really all the same thing with this carcass of all that's honorable.
Sniveling and weak.
He can't. Whining is his brand. #cuck
And this is from a state whom every single day lies about being an island...
Nothing is too low for classless clueless crude trump.  Whining lying are who he is. Can't & won't change
He's not a POTUS he's a POS
Where are My Unicorns? And My Storm Proof Hair Spray?
t We had the chances. We choose to follow the law.
You need to understand the workings of @realDonaldTrump's brain It has the mental capacity of a 10 y/old He has no clue how 2 b Presidential
Actually Mr President they are laughing at you
The only way he knows how to exist is to cheat. #25thAmendmentNow
Trump is pathologically incapable of imagining having an opportunity to make a power play and NOT taking it.
@realDonaldTrump: Isn't that exactly what you guys did to get Gorsuch in after stonewalling Garland? Maybe I'm imagining it.
Correction. NOTHING is beneath this POTUS. Trump has no rock bottom when it comes to unacceptable actions.
Get rid of Electoral College, Hillary, with most popular votes, would be President. Be careful what you wish for?
If there's anything this POTUS has proved, it is that nothing is beneath him
Trump's every word, very breath is beneath a Potus.

I'm sure I'm not the first to say this, but The Whitehouse white house does have a certain ring to it.
Not beneath that little man though!
Rule of law means nothing to #TreasonousTrump @POTUS weasel
#whining not #winning
You call it whining.  I call it speaking the truth.
#AmendmentXXV
Nothing is beneath this president!
There's nothing beneath the human garbage we now call @POTUS
When Trump said there's be so much winning you'd be sick of it, that was a typo. He said "so much whining, bigly"
Check out Peggy Noonan article in WSJ about POTUS whining.
Next time my heads gonna be spinning!

#PotusUnhinged #TimeFor25


Then get rid of him! He is destroying this country every damn day!!!!!!! 
It's beneath the normal POTUS. But, it's not beneath this one.
@realDonaldTrump GET OVER IT, U #StupidUnprecidentedIllegitimatePOSCheatingLiar!!!!
Beneath a POTUS? Plz give me a break! The world just do not understand why Republican are holding on to him so desperately!
Nothing is beneath this POTUS.
Getting old Donald, very old, and tired. Try some new batshit crazy idea okay, something a little more fresh, please!
Take the gloves off Shelly, it'll feel goooood
Beneath a POTUS is the POTUS Potty, which is where he sits while tweeting at 4:00 AM.
Everyine PLEASE stop saying what is beneath this man or the office. He is a bottom dweller and not one single thing is beneath him.
omfg! 45 is a fucking simpleton!

#44THMICDROP: Finish, through my will be done. What about your legacy? You can't erase history my administration and I made! "Next" Trump! 
#25thAmendment
Is there a children's book that they could maybe read aloud on Fox&Friends that would cover some basic government processes for him?
Schoolhouse rock? Only half-kidding
Clearly #DonTheCon has never seen "I'm Just a Bill."  Maybe start small w/ "A Noun is a Person Place or Thing?" Features girl in short skirt
This tweet. Lol

You're my hero.
Thank you Sir for your excellent Qs in the Browder interview.
I heard you can't help but whine when you're beneath PotUS!
Why is this impeachment taking so long? He's going to tweet us into WWIII. You're all idiots for allowing this circus to continue.
I hope Congress does- impeachment will get 51 votes easily
Beneath this POTUS is his thumb.

@LouiseMensch russia piss tapes!!!
@realDonaldTrump

He's beyond embarrassing
We all know where that's going if you guys ever get back in control...hope that never happens.
You got one brain damaged Republican to be a Traitor and your Proud?
Hell. You've got one brain damaged Republican to be President. Proud?
Children whine. And he is nothing but a petulant child. Whining and tantruming. He's an embarrassment to children.
Impeach him already.  Government is becoming a joke putting up with his threats.  Aren't we all human beings and deserve respect?  Do right.
I like that 'Creepy Billionaires' soundbite!
Democrats now have an obligation to work with Republicans except Cruz and Paul and Sanders to re-write ACA
With all do respect Senator It's pointless to keep scolding egoistic narcissist We're past that stage It's time to start disciplining him
Can I wield the whip?
Nothing is beneath this @POTUS . Just ask the Boy Scouts or police association or @SenJohnMcCain or women whose crotches he's grabbed.
Does Trump ever stop whining? It seems like the only time he stops whining is when he's smirking. What an incredibly grating creature.
Do what the people deserve! This kid in chief is embarrassing! Jail all the Trumps u too Ivanka
I do not find anything about the GOP funny! Laugh??? I am mad! Trump's administration is giving me frown lines! 
@realDonaldTrump this song just popped into my head PERFECT Should be Trump's theme song
He's dividing us & destroying democratic norms Senator Whitehouse.
Please do what you can to get him out of the people's house. And quickly.
Please stop drinking the Starbucks...
I have always been happy that I have continued to vote for you. You make Rhode Islanders proud. Thank you.
Only change this country needs is a new election WITHOUT RUSSIAN &PUTIN interference.@realDonaldTrump RESIGN TODAY TAKE A NAP GET A HAIR CUT
And paper ballots!!!!!!! 
When Obamacare totally implodes the American people will suffer. Elected Congress people don't have Obamacare, do they Senator? How come?
O'h Sheldon, I really like you on "The Big Bang Theory" #ProgressivesAreWusses
pretty sure it's a staffer tweeting for him, so technically it isn't a president whining.
Trump does his own tweets. @POTUS account can be Trump or staffers.
Forgive me if I don't take your word for this. Sentence structure, grammar, & spelling have improved since the switch from android to iphone
You think a staffer would be permitted to tweet some of the crap from @realDonaldTrump acct every day? I’ve got a bridge for sale…
Okay, so your statement wasn't based on direct knowledge then?  I don't think Bannon asks Donnie's permission to do anything,  vice-versa
Right on, Sen Sheldon!
Go Sheldon!
@SenWhitehouse, shut this dictator down!
He can't because he's a big baby.  #impeach . He's met the misbehaving needed for it.
"Senator Thomas J. Walsh (D-MT) first advocated using the constitutional option in 1917." http://faculty.washington.edu/jwilker/353/353Assignments/Gold_Gupta_JLPP_article.pdf …
Once again, @realDonaldTrump demonstrates an amazing lack of understanding of government and U.S. history.
He is ignorant and has no interest in policy. Trump creates chaos like all fascists.
Talk about whining! When are you going to stop the whining, aren't you tired of losing, grow up or shut up.
Guess he thinks the Republicans will have a majority forever.

Govt doesn't have a successful medical insurance program
Why work w/ RINOs & Dems when they support socialism
Replace them then repeal ACA
@realDonaldTrump 
ppl w/unhealthy lifestyles like drug abusers & ppl w/ promiscuous sex habits
need to learn about paying their fair share
nothing is beneath this president. he will go as low as is humanly possible..  and then brag about it...

You are beneath a senator to behave like a high schooler
There is NOTHING presidential about him!!!
Beneath POTUS has become a redundant phrase. It's a description of the normal state of this admin.
I am "laughing at Rs."
