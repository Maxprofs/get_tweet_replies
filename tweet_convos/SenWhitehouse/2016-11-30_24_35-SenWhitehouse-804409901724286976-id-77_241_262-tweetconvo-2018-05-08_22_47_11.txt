http://wapo.st/2glaPN0 
another negative story...let's worry now & shit on our next president. Thx Washington post for more biased & fake news
the state of the comments on this.
 People are hilarious. Science keeps you alive and functioning.
There are almost as many who do NOT agree with those who believe in man-made climate change.Keep the planet clean is a must.
worries never help but finding a solution for that which worries is of essence.
join the club!
Indeed, join the club 
that's the best you can do #BORING  @pmdjo
WTH does "diversity" have to do with science?
And here's something to think about
Guess that means it's not man-made? https://twitter.com/NorthJerseybrk/status/798184505844469762 …
E=mc squared

Ya think...he make things up, out of thin air!!!
lol. Thump thinks the Earth is flat. #wednesdaywisdom

I'm independent, voted for Hillary, cried more (tears of joy) whem president Obama made history. #cuphalfempty
Not to worry.  Real science will be observed.  Chicken little science will not be given a place at the table!
LMAO it's insane when you have to ask a President to embrace science & not ignorance.
LOL
the majority of us are really, really worried about Trump! On so many levels!! Especially the environment @realDonaldTrump

The "I Know Nothing About Everything" pres. should scare the hell out of them. An idiot will be in the WH starting Jan 21

@sarahkaplan48 fiction
Which #scientists?
@washingtonpost
sucks but science and  conservation get in the way of progress, the ability of a few assholes to get rich beyond reason
SCIENTIFIC DATA PROVED TRUMPS POLICIES WERE 99.8% accurate and he would win !
Any thinking person is afraid and should be. We are in uncharted territory here.
not NASA scientists!!!
@sarahkaplan48 Put them on the list. We all are.
@ElectoralCollge @DrJillStein
lol
> Our Sun is KEY to our entire solar system experiencing climatic change, but only a few have SOLD U A BILL OF GOODS for $$$
correction- every facet of science is worried.
People have stopped reasoning all together Trump set up teams and now his supporters will continue to create conflict
So are non-scientists.
Who isn't worried ? Oh ya maybe the meathead followers of his , sad
He knows he is taunting people to create conflict and he wants the violence so that he will always have strong support
U totally agree he relishes in mayhem.
as they should be. He doesn't believe in science
#fakenews. Who cares this is a non substanative story 
right wapo. Which scientists
Trump should stop playing games by taunting people. He bates people to make them angry then he acts stupid
dahhh
Glad to see that all of us non-scientists aren't alone in their worry.
"Really Really Worried" you guys love to shovel that hysteria crap
#fakenews
they should be. He doesn't believe ocean's levels are rising. Global warming Is a hoax.
@sarahkaplan48  And many other people too.
especially his hair design
Good.
That's funny....u mean that there will be no more millions spent on why shit smells like shit. Fake News WaPost
Donald Trump really really really doesn't care.
They're worried about their budget spending next year. #TrumpTrain over GravyTrain

Get on line with the majority of voting Americans. We are terrified.
oh so there's one thing scientists can agree on?
We are ALL worried about Donald 
... Bco's Now "Cat" Will Be Out Of "The Bag"....@washintonpost.@jimmyfallon.@eleendegeners.#cnni.#bbc.#rt_com.#japantimes
What are they not worried about?
Why? Is it because they may now actually have to use the scientific method?
- yeah / why / he is delegating as a manager and his Ivanka is President in charge
I feel dumber for having read the first two paragraphs of that awful article.
seems pretty unscientific to be closed-minded towards a future outcome
They are afraid of losing grants and funding for their jobs
Did you want the job?
Let me guess, these scientists don't have a problem with political affiliation when the POTUS hands them cash, right? Dumb.
@donaldtrump @KellyannePolls @SenSanders Scientists join the club. Every SANE person in America is worried about DT.
Holy crap!! America is worried that they only have Fox News to get Fair and Ethical News.
This headline alone tells me this is a dumb story and not worth my time to read.
Yeah, they should be worried. The climate change gravy train may be coming to an end.
they're not the only ones
he believes conspiracies at a rate never before seen in pubic office while placating believers in the Christian fairy tale
