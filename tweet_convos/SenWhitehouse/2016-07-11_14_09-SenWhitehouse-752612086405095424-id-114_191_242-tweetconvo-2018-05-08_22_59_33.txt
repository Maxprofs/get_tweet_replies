Really? Now? What about reducing gun violence? This is just a distraction.

People are lighting matches asshole.
@AugustLady241 No. They don't. Now what?

sorry Harry pull your head out of your dark hole and stop with all of the BS
You may be the most fake Mormon on the face of the planet. You seriously need to be punched as you take the sacrament, liar.
Luckily that is not how Mormons do things.
Say "Hello!" to George.Soros donated $6 million to the PAC supporting Hillary's presidential campaign. http://www.glennbeck.com/2016/07/12/evil-progressive-donors-part-i-george-soros/?utm_source=iHeart&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=iHeart-post20160712%20 …
It's NOT climate change...the Koch's R employing 1,000's of ppl with their companies. The earth's climate changes naturally!
How much is Soros paying you to deflect on Koch??
Another load of horse crap from the libturds.
we need rain here in San Antonio,Tx
Meanwhile under Obama the US built 10,000 Miles+ of oil and gas pipelines. Coal exports reached record levels. Get it?
idiot.
.@SenatorReid IPCC does NOT support your CO2-induced drought propaganda #WebOfDenial http://www.ipcc-wg2.gov/SREX/images/uploads/SREX-SPMbrochure_FINAL.pdf …
the wildfire claim is also pulled put of Reid's a$$
better check your Soros records. You almost have a Freudian obsession with the Kochs.  I think you're attracted to them, Harry
They don't care because it's NOT happening. But y'all go ahead and keep selling the lie.
Right. It's either climate change or drunken campers with matches & the Kochs don't care about either! #Monsters #UOldDrunk
why do you give so much of your time to the Koch's?
You say they don't care. I suggest they are merely not surprised. Geological background https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEPW_P7GVB8 …
It's spelled Cocks.  "The Asshats" or "The Shitdicks" would have also been acceptable.
It is improper for a US Senator to call out private citizens like this. You do a LOT of things that I don't care about.
Exercise bands are made from petroleum products. You're a corrupt fraud. Allegedly. @SenatorReid
The Koch brothers are way over 70 years old - they do not need a future (cf. Brexit).
What kind of #BULLSHIT is that Harry.  I suppose U believe it's actually their fault - oops, meant #BUSHs' fault!  Want 2 B PC!
- u don't care about people or you wouldn't have sanctuary cities
Dingy Harry lies again! Where are those mob enforcers that beat you up?
I can't figure out if you're good at propaganda or you really believe the things you say.
oh no the evils of global warming whatever will we do god you ppl are pathetic
blahahaha look at this old fool Reid and his climate cult. No science. Just old KKK bogeyman tactics. #WebOfDenial
Harry, are you being "careless" like @HillaryClinton ?
How's your AC in Nevada during August, Black Eyes, turned completely off to save the Erf, right?
what ridiculous propaganda. Both scientifically inaccurate and completely without merit. You're a bad man
How can you afford the Ritz Carlton when the rent is more than your salary? How did u become so wealthy being a Senator? Koch?
Go home Harry, you're drunk
Neither do any other thinking people.
And frankly Harry, most of us are getting sick & tired of your slanted opinions & political biases.
.......says it all.
.@SenatorReid you should buy the land where the drought is illegally just like you did in Nevada
Universities are complicit in the climate change crisis: they run by massive burning of #fossilfuels 
@SenatorReid 
STOP them!
#WebOfDenial
and neither do you unless you can make a buck under the table about it
and i do not care at all about you ole harry!
Go Fuck Yourself. Your An Enemy of the Republic Traitor!!!!
#Kochs never have cared, but they own enough of Congress that they don't need to care.  #NeverVoteRepublican
(This tweet paid for by the Green Government Grant Association).
Maybe that's because they know that climate change is a myth. Global warming is cyclical in nature.
'Cyclical' entails that this has happened before... so... when was the last time we went through this 'cycle'? #willfullyignorant
#Harry are you #Trumps secret VP nominee?
Harry, we know you are not dumb enough to believe in Climate Change. It's a control mechanism that you all want so bad.
Follow the history of this planet. Global weather change is natural. We have been warming since the end of the ice age
Come on climate change, you honestly think mankind can spew in 1 year the amount of contamination one volcano spews in a day?
swing and a miss. #MLBMetaphor
God cares for Americans but democrats hardly put God first.
The climate is always changing. No one would argue that. Just no proof that mankind is affecting it.
your obsession with cock brothers is fascinating. Wanna tell us something?
THERE is not Climate Change according to the Times.. we should be in an ice age by now1976 climate change NO ONE BELIEVES IN CC
Climate change doesn't effect golf courses. They r well watered. The grass doesn't burn. There's water and spirits in clubhouse
what about floods in WV and Houston? Hahahaha
how many birds of prey does your wind farms kill each year?how much money do you or ur family make from these?
good ol' " Crooked Hillary & Crooked Harry"
they know that climate change has been going on since the begining of time Reid needs a science class or is he just old
Kochbot Republicans don't care. Hottest summer in history. Did you check out the 1890s agenda for GOP convention? Turn back.
Oh, as in the last warm MWP? http://www.pnas.org/content/112/43/13261.full.pdf … B Fagan-THE GREAT WARMING. 100 yr droughts in CA
@SenWhitehouse Climate change is responsible for the end of the last ice age.
total lie it makes wildfires or drought more intense. If you care, push for more reservoirs. But wait! Environmentalists 
more accurate: they don’t care that politicians use the issue to lie about the threat to validate seizing even more power

Yes climate changes, in done parts of our country for times a year.
Remember back in your youth, ice age?All part of earth's cycles beyond our control.
You need some time away from Pelosi....SMH
Neither do you, or Dems would have done something about it when they had the power in 2009-2010.
THEY COULD CARE LESS
Climate change is a load of horse shit.
you do not care for the #protection of #American #citizens #constitutional #rights #statist #fascist
@SenWhitehouse Oh yeah. The real estate millionaire. Mr. Honesty. Please.
Pavlov's dog named Harry is salivating again #DingDingDing Retire @SenatorReid
@SenWhitehouse  If the Kochs could make money off of climate change they would get on board real fast.
Who isn't making $ on the Green gravy train? Derivatives10X? Big Short 2.0
Kinda like you don't care that you & your Democrat party are ruining our country?
@SenatorReid
all they care about is funding #HillaryClinton
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have spoken vanity and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord GOD.

BRAVO SENATOR!
@HillaryClinton paid @SenSanders $5 Million to endorse her! He took H' money! Such a disappointment! #NewHampshire #Tatiana
Do you actually think you can control the climate?
Dude, your obsession is weird.
they think there's Nothing we can do, but
They're Wrong.
