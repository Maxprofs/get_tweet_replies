And if he knew he was piling on the Qataris over what seems to be more Russian fake news?
Seems to me he probably planned this with the Russians.
nope...
If he doesn't know, he's a failed Commander-in-Chief. If he does know, he's a traitor.
Never start a sentence with “I wonder if Trump knows…”  No!  No he doesn’t and never will.
He couldn't find Qatar on a map.
Does any map other than his Electoral College map even EXIST in his mind?
Only map that matters if you want to be POTUS. Supprised Hillary didnt know that was how you get elected. Pissing off the voters didnt help
He was colluding with Russians on this Qatar misinformation
Someone tell Trump that he owns a resort in Qatar, and watch him slam it into reverse.
Does he know we have any bases anywhere outside the USA?
I seriously doubt it.
Hell No! He barely knows his name.
Thank you for all you do, Mr. Whitehouse!
@Vinylpoodle @nytimes What surprises me is Qtar has promised billions 4 our infrastructure; Qtar owns much of London. No Qtr$
Probably not he doesn't seem to know much of anything
I wonder if he knows So Korea pulled the plug on our anti-missle defense system.
With like thousands of troops @SenWhitehouse @MaddowBlog @nytimes
Highly doubtful
Probably not, he's just out to destroy the world. Already has a pretty good job in America. Isolating us from our closest allies.
He only knows what Putin & Bannon tell him.
doubtful, but I bet he knows exactly how many followers he has on twitter. You know important stuff
Heeeee heeee
Come on, of course NOT! He's totally clueless on ALL important matters! He appears to think he's on TV doing another reality show!
How long was that nase there ?
I asked him that, but no response.
@MaddowBlog @nytimes one can assume Trump doesn't know anything.
I'm sure he just forgot, or something, but probably read it in some MSM covfefe.....
We could really have fun finishing the sentence I wonder #IfTrumpKnows
Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
@MaddowBlog @nytimes Dumb like a fox...
OMFing G isn't that Treason?
I didn't know he new where Qata is!
I wonder if Trump's actions were ordered by his handler in the Kremlin
Hahaha
Bet he can't find Qatar on a map
I was thinking the same thing when this story broke.
That is so sad because I thought the same thing and really doubt that he does. He needs to go before he starts WWIII
I've been to that US base in Qatar.
@realDonaldTrump you didn't, did you Donny
Trump knows nothing about the government, its structure, the military, or its running. @realDonaldTrump has no idea where our bases are.
I wonder if trump knows ANYTHING.
I'll bet he doesn't! 
Ops! did he out his Russian agenda again? 
He doesn't
Since he didn't know Israel is in the Middle East, I strongly doubt it!
Nah Geography was not his best subject in school. Come to think of it nothing was, he knows absolutely nothing about anything.
He's Clueless!!
He could not find it on a world map
Nope
Of course he didn't,  I'm sure he does now covfefe 
Oh my, Commander In Chief incoherent, keep posted Sheldon! Thank you Mr Whitehouse! President Whitehouse possible?
Not. Why would POTUS need to know that??
I wonder if he can even pronounce Qatar
I doubt it. But then again I also doubt he'd make the connection of his negativity and it's affects on them. Honestly, he doesn't care.
Thank you for condemning the 400b arms sale to Saudi Arabia. You did that, right?
I don't think Dump can even name any of the three countries not committed to the Paris agreement.
@realDonaldTrump would only know if he had one of his shitty hotels there. Can we PLEASE stop the madness already? I miss sleep and sanity.
I'm going to go with "No" for 50 million Alex....
Of course not. Even if he did, he wouldn't care.
#impeachment #imp
No.
Inquiring minds want 2 know ? Is 45 the 1 we want in charge of #Allin4America demands a leader who knows how to lead & knows History
#TrumpObstructed #TrumpRussia
Trump likely thinks Qatar is a gay guitar player.
LMAO ..... probably the whole Trump clan would as well ........
Maybe he does. Now.
“During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology,” - Yay to defunding #GOP!
Sessions probably convinced him all US personnel stationed in Qatar are liberalsz
He does now. Some people just can't keep a secret. @GOP @DNC @FBI
@MaddowBlog @nytimes 
I seriously doubt he knows anything about it, nor could he even point to it on a map.
Trump knows nothing
Love how "all (Trump's) references point to Qatar." All references except the US ic/natsec community. Where Trump getting his Intel?
*coughRussiacough*
*coughBreitbartcough*
*coughInfoWarscough*
*coughDrudgeReportcough*
*coughFauxNewscough*
Time to pivot back to tweets mean nothing again.
Based on past performance/knowledge expressed...not a chance
What is "NO?"

I'll take "Trump Knowledge" for $400, Alex.
Do U even have to ask?
@MaddowBlog Doubtful.
Trump only knows where his golf courses are.
Knowledge is out said reason
He probably thinks it's on its way to North Korea.
If it ain't got a hotel, it don't count. Maybe they can change the name of the base to Trump!
Nope
Or that Russia hacked the emails and staged the whole thing
Doubtful. He doesn't seem to know much of anything.
No he doesn't Sheldon he doesn't know much come to think of it
#Trump only knows were his Russian financed hotels are. #TrumpRussia #TrumpRussiaCoverUp
I wonder if he could even find all of THOSE on maps.
He does. No worries snowflakes, @realDonaldTrump has this covered.
shill!!
I asked the same question. Someone brief him before something bad happens
no
Probably not
Sad presidency
Probably not. But #Saudi Arabia sucked him in
quick! someone wake him up and tell him! tweet tweet!
I wonder if Trump cares or has mental capacity or IQ as to why that matters?
Donald is admitting that he took millions from a state sponsor of terrorism. Let him. Qatar Airways still pays rent at Trump Tower.
He doesn't even know, which countries are in the Middle East.
? Probably not.
Not unless it #FauxFox news told him.
Nope!
