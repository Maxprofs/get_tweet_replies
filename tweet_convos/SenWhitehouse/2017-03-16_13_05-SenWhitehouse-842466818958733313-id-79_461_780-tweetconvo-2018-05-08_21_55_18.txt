I did not see that in the proposal. However, if that's your complaint, then work with Congress to improve it.
Don't just sit on the sidelines, and complain about it while the ACA is failing.
raise his taxes.  He pays less % than I do
So does Obama & Bernie sanders but you aren't mad at them are you?
IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT THE TOP 1% AND NOT AMERICANS. MONEY MONEY MONEY. MIDDLE/LOW INCOME DON'T COUNT. GET RID OF POOR
Sheldon, those cuts are required to reduce government and will not affect jobs, education or public health!
#PublicSchools are worth fighting for
You can't make sense of anything tRump says, he's a ranting fool.The problem, followers are too dumb to know it.
Have you considered running as a SOCIALIST? You sound like a Bernie Clone.
what did u think his agenda was when he ran and u people let it happen.
Mulvaney didn't even look at the figures on who is helped thru this program...GOP HATES EVERYONE except top 400
Tell me Sheldon what have you done for the people of RI...ahhhh????
@SenateDems Thank you Senator. You remind me of young Senator Pell, but hipper.
@SenateDems To build his F'ing wall. SO looking forward to the impeachment proceedings.
What are your reasons 4 impeachment? A POTUS doing exactly what he said he would do??? Oh the horror!
He hasn't committed TREASON yet but Obama did & U had NO OUTRAGE!Selective outrage by dems! Priceless!
Fmr Dem, eh? I'm glad, I'd never want to be associated with anything you're a part of.
Well if Ur against the border wall...I don't want anything 2 do w/you! I want illegals out of our country & off our tax dollars!
You want Republicans to work with Democrats like the Democrats worked with Republicans on the ACA? Right? You got it!
ASK THE PPL WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT THIS BUDGET! IMHO EVERY OFFICE, AGENCY,DEPART. & POLITICIAN SHOULD CUT THEIR BUDGET by 15%!
Thank you! @SenWhitehouse Please keep the pressure on + encourage other Dem leaders to do the same. We need help right now!
@JoeMyGod Trumplethinskin is senseless so, sadly, his budget makes sense. See what I did there?
I've watched you over & over on C-Span & other formats. You are simply a genius!! I admire you & value your words.
And who should be surprised?
Get rid of this mental president that disgrace the office, get some guts and press for impeachment NOW
We greatly support you and value your common sense analysis of these poor plans to "Disrupt" our government & our lives!!
Please make sure you do everything in your power to block it!
@SenateDems you sound shocked.......Have you been living in a cave?
@SenateDems
Spicer said today Trump want 2 stop wasteful spending of tax dollars.I say BS..
BS? What you call dems being doing for years wasting our tax payers $ present haven't worked for us 1/20/2017
@SenateDems blah, blah, blah. Win an election and pass your own budget instead of bitching about this one. I like it.
@NYTupelo7 it's heartless & inhumane. Why take  $ from Great Lakes, largest source of fresh water, & drinking for millions
@GormleyMark actually, it favors the real taxpayers
everyone knew this would happen
so was the last 8 years!!
@SenateDems the Christian TAliban is in charge
@SenateDems Dems guilty of doing too much for poor. R's guilty of doing nothing for poor! That's reason for more/ less gov!
@SenateDems
@SenateDems if you cut all these programs there is going to be a lot of people out of work
@SenateDems
@SenateDems "President" Trump has to be forced out of office sooner rather than later.
Sure. Because overturning the results of a democratic election is American as apple pie.
"democratic" lol if presidential elections were democratic popular vote would elect.Check dictionary
oh, and you're blocked for being not smart. Your side lost & here's why. Read it, know it, live it.
@SenateDems so what are dems doing to help????
@SenateDems It is undoubtedly the dumbest budget proposal in America's history and please feel free to quote me on that.
no.
@SenateDems agreed - hope you're strong enough to fight back- to date Dems are always Mr. Nice Guy, to no avail
@NYTupelo7 why would even the wealthy want needless military spending and a useless wall?
Because the greedy Oligarchs value material things over actual people. 
#Sociopaths
I do, too.
@SenateDems it's the best most dramatic government reforming budget ever proposed! #MAGA
@SenateDems can we have a national referendum on the wall?
And that's not a bug; it's a feature.
@SenateDems the Wealthy care about environment, science, the poor. It is just cruel and hurts all Americans #shame
<<<Liars lying.
This should be called puts Trump first. Somehow, someway it's lining his or his families pockets. Entitlement. #resist
@SenateDems Liberal talk get over it.
@SenateDems so what's being done about it instead of just reporting that we R being taken over by Dictators?
Obame Care was WORSE for American Jobs? BE HONEST at least .... #MakeDemocratsLooseAgain DEMAGOG and LOOSE AGAIN
@SenateDems it BUILDS OUR MILITARY AND HELPS VETS. #middleclassSPOKE This is what WE WANT
Id like to say I cant wait to be rich enough for tax breaks but not at the expense of others necessities. @SenWhitehouse @SenateDems
he is only out to help his cronies. He pats their back, they pat his. #TrumpAmerica
Where was UR outrage when Obama did Crap 4 HIS CRONIES?He appointed them & gave them NO BID CONTRACTS!
That's right, let your anger flow. You know you are really mad at #Trump for lying to America
Trump didn't lie to me....good try though...
@SenateDems It's repeal and replace the GOP Congress  and @VP it's time to draft the letter unfit President to @SenateGOP
@SenateDems How?
bla bla bla bla bla bla.........
@SenSanders @SenSchumer  We need to go beyond mere criticism to positive initiatives
Thank you - keep strongly opposing these cruel and illogical budget cuts. #resist
preserve public education
A free & approbate public education for all. It is a Federal right, #DeVos #Trump have no clue.#DeVoscharterqueen
Not a right, maybe you should re-read the constitution
Thank you for vowing to oppose this plan. I will do everything in my power as a citizen to protest this budget.
- so DO SOMETHING about it, please
yes...Jobs we the public pay for..Tired of it.
@DNC He's a runaway train. Someone please move the tracks!
It's horrific for the poor and the sick. The most vulnerable will suffer. Horrible. But we shouldn't be surprised
This budget weakens the citizenry and strengthens the military - which is exactly what Russia wants, I'm sure.
Russia want's America to be more of a super power?? Do you even listen to yourself?
Hold his, all Republicans' feet to the . We are counting on you!
