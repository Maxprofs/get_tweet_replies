The only thing phony around here is you
From the lips of the second biggest assclown in the Senate...
Very phony indeed.... yep get it into House/Senate conference committee and by-pass Senate rules
Thanks for an explanation..demystifying yet clearly horrifying..
Seriously?  Someone actually had to ask?  Sheesh!
As of today, the only two republican senators with testicular fortitude are women!
How ironic. Though, to be completely honest, not terribly surprising.
White collar guys like this are so hot  +1
What the hell is this ?
It's the  #WeldonShitehouse #WalkWithMe segment. This week Weldon leads the masses of &$$es toward the dungeon of Dr. Doom! #FearFactor
Thank you for fighting for us, Senator!
Hey Whitehouse just admit Obamacare was a big LIE. You should of never voted for Ocare.Reps will fix your mistake
learn to speak English.
Business as usual then.
Thank you for reiterating.
Pls fight this stunt with every means at ur disposal! Also, Dems shd propose Medicare-for-all amendments during voteOrama.
Phoney stunt is your middle name.    Phony is all you do lately.  To be clear you want to keep the current healthcare with its problems  yes
Yes it is not only a stunt. It is disingenuous. It seems the arrival of @realDonaldTrump has made outright lying OK to @GOP
I employ you all in Washington DC in Congress to ask us , healthcare professionals what we think about Healthcare reform we have the answers
Dude, where's my penumbra of privacy??

Thank you Senator.
So you refuse to even debate this matter? Why are you even there? This makes you look like an obstructionist.
I hope Bob Nardolillo runs you right out of RI I embarrassment. You, Jack Reed  and Langevin screwed the ppl of RI over big time.
Phony stunt is right.  Check final update at the end of the thread.
1. Outing CEO's who may be calling the shots on the healthcare bill. Starting with Mark Bertolini.(Aetna)What was his prediction? Thread 
Why can't anyone stop this? Do citizens have to storm the capital with muskets for cryin out loud?
#SaveOurCare #TheResistance
Thank you for the clarity, Sen. Whitehouse! It is gratifying to hear such a direct explanation of McConnell's desperate backroom deception.
Senator Whitehouse, thanks for fighting for the people. 
THIS man had it right...all this is a Phony Stunt.
I'm horrified for America. @SenateGOP @SenateDems you must unite!  Govern as you're elected to do! #ProtectOurCare
Ha Ha ! Your name is Sheldon !
Whitehouse is not telling the truth, again.  This type of bill in introduced and passed on a regular basis. He just can't be honest.
NOT TRUE BILL. @SenWhitehouse  is an extreamely honest, Popular senator! GO AWAY TROL
Sounds good to me as long as you do something. Chances are if you don't like it most Americans will like it
Speaking of phonies....
Thats RIGHT Senator. Expose that worm @SenateMajLdr-Can Alway count on you 4 the TruthRIPROUD
Yes, exactly what is happening now!
Some might think CIA brainwashing is a phoney stunt to embarrass+humiliate its victim but there's a lot of interesting facts to be learned!
I'm sure others have already said it... but how about we put Senator Whitehouse in THE White House!!! #healthcare #SaveACA
@SamIamLax
Sad... but true. That's what you voted to allow @SenJohnMcCain #HealthCare
thanks, Senator Whitehouse. You and a few other senators and congressmen/women  are our best hope.
Like Obamacare @SenWhitehouse
Thank you Sen. Whitehouse for letting us know..   But, now what?
Need to start reminding the electorate that GOP doesn't care about healthcare, they care about tax cuts for their donors.

Thank you @SenWhitehouse for being open and honest about the situation.
So they can say they voted for  "it"
Thank you for your work in protecting the US and informing us+the world of issues today+tomorrow. You instill equal bravery.
Second time in my life that I am sad to be a US citizen

Thank you for watching out for us!!!
It's shameful that @SenJohnMcCain gave a speech about bipartisanship & then voted to proceed w/debate. Voting no, would have forced bi-part!
Keep fighting and informing the public! We MUST IMMEDIATELY ban together & #Fight4Medicare4All Many Repubs want it to. BAN TOGETHER FOLKS!

You are a GREAT American,,, Period!  #Healthcare
A bigger stunt than the ACA? Hardly. We've had Enough. This will be your last term. Dump the Dems 2018.
