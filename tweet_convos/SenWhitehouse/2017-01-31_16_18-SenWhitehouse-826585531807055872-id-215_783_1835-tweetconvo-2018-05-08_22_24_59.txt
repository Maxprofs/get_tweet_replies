@SenateDems Fine, but vote up or down, now. Congress will be watched and they're accountable to constituents in '18 election.
Thank you for your stand on Trump's nominees. Stay strong!
Thank you for speaking, Senator. Keep voting no. #NoWallNoBan 
#NotMyPresident
another coward.  Stop grandstanding.  We will vote all of you cowards out asap and put people with a spine up there.
How can America trust an AG who is a proven liar & bigot? What the hell is happening to our country?
@TomWellborn Keep trying, I know it must be hard & frustration....but there's no choice at this point.
@SenateDems Actually that time is now. If GOP keeps falling in goose step line then it's safe to assume they are fascist
So what are you going to do? Oh. There's nothing you CAN do.  Cry like your leader. And get ready to join unemployment :)
Glad to see the right is no better than the left.
And no better than the center.  That's politics.  Deal with it.  We're fed up.
At least I'm not following either side blindly off a cliff. Fire/dispose of anyone who doesn't agree with u?
Well good for you.  Must be nice to not have any problems that require government accountability.
I vote for who I think the best candidate is and what I think is best, do not just vote along party lines
Extremism has never solved anything. Ever
Again. The only extremism, and unprecedented, mindless obstructionism is coming from Democrats.That's fine.
maybe you should ask more intelligent questions
@OrangeThinSkin keep going
Go, Sheldon, go!
Good for you. Resist.
@ProvostQuigley I just saw something that said that YOU voted for every single Trump nominee. Is that true?
Aren't you glad you didn't nuke the filibuster to silence minority opposition in 2013?
Oh, you did what?

Oh... well.
Bummer?
@SenateDems You will filibuster & block this SC nom or we will find a true progressive and primary u in next election.
Excellent speech at the Sessions hearing today, thank you.  Please vote no on Sessions, Tillerson & DeVos.
Thank you. Vote No. Get your colleagues to do the same. Please.
We can look up your votes, you know!
@SenateDems you know why they won't answer, it's a COUP. Wake up and block at all costs!
@SenateDems you have some sh^t on your hands too there Senator.
@SenateDems dont sit quite we are behind you she is not a Leader the kids objects her.
I know I don't live in your state and am not a constituent ( live in Texas), I have much more respect for u than my Senators
Thank you for your diligence.  This is a DISASTER #UNFIT #IMPEACCH #RESIST
@SenateDems have you answered your questions?? Senator?? #draintheswamp
Really? You won't? https://goo.gl/oxBToa  Because so far, you've given them a clean sweep.
The only thing you're not being silent about is how you're not going to be silent.
this guy is playing us. His base is leaving him.
I am not from Rhode Island, but live in Florida, but no matter, you stand for values that I admire and respect. G-D Bless You
@SenateDems: If you boycotted hearings, you forfeited chance to ask questions! Be present to be counted. #Consequences #2018
@existingtoday Then show up for the hearings.
@SenateDems they are doing what they can. They r the minority the Republicans hold the power
@SenateDems The @GOP is no longer a legitimate legal entity. Why should we believe we have anything but naked coercion?
@SenateDems either implement full on obstruction or I'll never vote dem again. Voted dem since 1980. Done with your games.
are you kidding? you voted yes to all of these nominees. please explain this statement?
Actually you should learn that silence holds more strength than blather ANY day. Maybe it wd behoove U to try it
@SenateDems SO DISGUSTED MOST DEM SENATORS ARE DOING NOTHING TO SUPPORT US! Frustrated and tired of fighting w/no support
@SenateDems This is disgusting that Dems a obstructing conformations because of personal feelings i
Go Senator S Whitehouse!!! Your are right they are a bumbling group.  Now why did CNN cut away from his impassioned speech?
@SenateDems Receipts! 
if u showed up for work, u could have asked ur questions
you voted yes on all. That and the power station in burrillville you've lost our votes and many more to votes
So you just won't show up?  Unprecedented.  Cheap, political ploy, and as Sen. Hatch said, "you should be ashamed".
@SenateDems Hahaha!  You aren't needed anymore!  STAY HOME UNTIL ALL ARE CONFIRMED!!!
SO you continue to show just how disruptive the democrats are and what is wrong with congress. Children.
@SenateDems #resist
Apparently the GOP just excluded you from deliberations:
BREAKING: Senate committee approves Trump Treasury, Health nominees without Dems present after GOP changes panel's rules.
@SenateDems  putting our economy and safe at risk get to doing your jobs
@SenateDems Don't break rank. You may not have the numbers, but you have power to send a loud message & gain 2018 support.
@SenateDems Bye bye. See you all in the main sector of the population come reelection time. People see your horrible behavior
@SenateDems Stand strong in unity. We stand w/you & have your backs #2018. Stay focused on BannonTrump hidden agendas, though
Trump is UNFIT regardless, he must go. He is a bully and ran his campaign on fear and demagoguery.
☼ POWER TO THE PEACEFUL ☼ doublestandard Trump hard on Hillary, soft on Republican greed. #Mnunchin's100M
@SenateDems Grow up & do your damn job! You are all hypocrites! Sick of your temper tantrum!
KARMA/FLASHBACK: Senate goes for 'nuclear option' http://politi.co/1aIUuqp

@SenateDems We expect Dems to FIGHT for us!!! We are fighting. Why aren't you??
Thank you for working to protect our democracy. WHERE ARE THE OTHER DEMS? @SenSchumer @SenSanders @CoryBooker @SenFranken
12/9/16:
Trump's Secretaries:
Education wants to privatize it
Environment denies the science of it
Labor is anti-laborers
12/14/16: Looks like all these wolves nominated for the chicken shack are a ploy to tie up Congress for months. Why? Dunno!
@SenateDems we heard that line before cut it out. Where's ur balls I think trump is grabbing and has them!!!
@SenateDems stop the bs there no u can silence u have to speak no matter what. Get on a blow horn and get some leverage.
The start standing up to Trump. Start obstructing his picks like the GOP did us. Or YOU can get voted out....
@SenateDems ...how childish...you have cheapened America in our eyes.
#MAGA

How YOU vote NOW determines how WE vote LATER. #DoNotCave #Resist #WeHaveYourBack
@SenateDems just more petulant temper tantrums by dems who are trying to shut down the government
@SenateDems no - you weren't silent - you simply voted yes

Thank you. Tell Trump no SCOTUS vote til Sessions is withdrawn and replaced with an AG who will uphold the law
Thank you, Senator.

Yay. KEEP FIGHTING!!!
Awesome! They are all dismally unqualified. Just vote no.
@SenateDems just you wait for election time
It's Democrats who don't follow the Constitution. You want a liberal S.C. Judge who legislates from the bench.
It's payback time! Repubs stole our SCOTUS under President Obama! Do not go gently into the good night! Fight!
.@SenWhitehouse @PxlJedi We've got a chart that says you've voted 'Yes' for every cabinet nominee so far. What's up with that?  #NoConfirm
Your language & tone shows that U R not even willing to wk. with Trump picks or the American people who U work 4.
HELLO @SenWhitehouse & @SenateDems please continue to fight for us all.
Thank you,
God Bless You

Everyone already knows that you're nothing more than an obstructionist. Democrats in 2017 are trying not to be irrelevant.
@SenateDems nor should you be silent
regarding Bannon, https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/3021 … see Section A item 6.... so why isn't anyone following up?
@SenateDems Big NO on #BetsyDevos. Unqualified & inept. She is an insult to every educational professional in this country.

@SenateDems #Alltalknoaction
thank you. #ImpeachTrump
ok I'm glad you're fired up now take that memo, get out of your office and make shit happen! A memo isn't enough anymore.

Not sure who is telling the truth.
@SenateDems Congress has no room to talk Do your jobs for once and please dont tell us your questions related to Climate
