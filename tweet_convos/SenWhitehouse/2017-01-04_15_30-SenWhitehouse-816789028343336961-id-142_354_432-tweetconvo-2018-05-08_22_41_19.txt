@SenSchumer How do you know?Did you actually read it?
It's repeal AND REPLACE. You are leaving out (aka lying) the replace part. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJXR2zUdmAU … SheldonLies
Cheaper yet higher quality (than OBamacare) insurance. End state lines on insurance monopolies. done
I've actually lived in a country that has that. I no longer want that, used to Anyways, happy-2017 2U
@SenSchumer You guys should worry less about Obama's legacy & more about what's right for the country
@SenSchumer I thought they didn't have a plan? Will you liars please come up with the same fake story!!!
Bunch of Lying Sacks Of Shit...
So do you two have Obamacare? NO! Didn't think so
@SenSchumer nice fake news, I like how Ds pull numbers out of air
Be skeptical. Seek the Cure. http://ACureForWellness.com 
5 MILLION HAD & LOST INSURANCE DUE TO OBAMACARE; 13 MILLION TO MEDICAID; ILLEGALS GIVEN COVERAGE & AMERICANS LOST
@SenSchumer Do something constructive instead of lying & carrying water for lame duck Obama. Remember, you work for America!
always sky is falling BUT the  ones who really make it fall are called democrats-originators of chaos theory
@MypaperpheartQH #GOP plan is simple: return to pre-Obamacare situations & force 30 million people to have charity care only.
Obama proposed a Medical Device Tax 2 help support AHCA.  Lobbyist successfully shot down.  Y?  we all pay taxes. #lookitup
Not a coincidence, that hundreds of lobbyists represent the medical industry & healthcare is affordable.  Congrs sold out..
Look up lobbyist scandals. Congress does not represent the taxpayer, then represent lobby firms & special interests. BOUGHT
2003-Medicare Modernization Act, congress gave monopoly 2 drug co's against Medicare. Drug co's set price as an industry.....
Congress conducts private business w/ healthcare industry.  Moving in & out of congress, lobbyist manipulate law against us
@SenSchumer 

Repeal=strong word?
Tweaking=operative present word?
Support New Pres as many issues.
Must really focus & try!
@SenSchumer Yes, we are already SICK of lies to force ineffective overpriced government solutions on us, and SICK of YOU.
@SenSchumer I'm age 63 & cancelled insurance up 100% it costs more than my mortgage payment! Stop charging for not having ins
Trash Trump Keep ACA
Give us your health coverage and take ours!  How about that?  Obamacare sucks and you know it!
Are you worried all your illegals will be uninsured--I'm not, can't wait to see this piece of crap gone
Your lies got you slaughtered in 2016 and will be much worse in 2018. Keep doing what you are doing!!!!!!!!!!!
All saber rattling over healthcare is disgusting.  Congress has already sold out to the lobby for dr's, hospitals & HC ins.
Taxpayers, go 2 Wikipedia, Medicare Modernization 
Act, under Legislative History.  Congress cheated taxpayers w/drug monoply
then negotiate w/Medicare.  Some drugs have a 1,000% markup, but Medicare negotiated 15% discount.  Corrupt!
Insurance market is your real concern  838 lobbyist protect HC ins, of that #, 477 R former congsmn, they R called revolvers.
my premiums, deductible and copay have all gone up 100% since ACA . It's unacceptable. Need to fix it
Schumer is provoking divisiveness between both parties & addicted to playing political games.
@SenSchumer This is unacceptable. Thank you for fighting for the American people, Senator Schumer! #TheResistance
so now you come out ? you are like a bug
@SenSchumer What about the millions who U ruined it for?  Dems own this mess 100%. Many can't afford the cost & deductibles
it is acceptable, why should I pay for drug addicts, criminals, lazy, bums, illegals, etc.?
who cares??? NO CITIZEN I KNOW ASKED FOR OBAMACARE. YOU ARE OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE MAJORITY. You do not spk 4 me!!
the middle class can't afford to pay for 30,000,000 people on subsidies! Do the math
The taxpayers who pay your salary should not be saddled with subsidizing this poorly thought out disaster called ObamaCare!
Website alone was $800mil. 40 million insured now. Isn't that $20 million dollars per person to build website?
I am geting sick. SICK of listening to you losers
@SenSchumer How many people lost their plan? Their doctor? Who saved & 2500?
Good!The lazy will get jobs now.Why do I have to work more for others ins. when I cannot even afford my own?
Just dismantling ACA is like taking down a bridge BEFORE a new one is built.  Doesn't make sense. Irresponsible!
Republicans should not be allowed to dismantle ACA. If they fon't like it? Propose new health care legislation.
At lease I won't be paying for someone else to have insurance and I don't have any
@SenSchumer More BULLSHIT FAKE NEWS.Most #s inflated.  Most of these people R on Medicaid & pay 0 while rest work ASSES OFF.
@SenSchumer new year, same story, Americans don't get the health care coverage they deserve
@SenSchumer This is simply not true! You are trying a scare tactics.
@SenSchumer and millions of  premiums might go  back to pre-Obamacare levels, just saying
#RepealAndReplace the question is how and when 20M people are at stake #Obamacare @POTUS #NorthCarolina #Florida @SenSchumer
Breaking News: Dems resort to fear mongering as a desperate last resort to hold onto any relevancy whatsoever. You own this failure liberals
@SenSchume#WeDemandINVESTIGATION #WeDemandINVESTIGATIONGOP #WeDemandINVESTIGATIONTrump #TrumpLeaks #TheResistance 
Or insurance companies without people to pay them Rather!!
@SenSchumer I thought i could keep my doctor!
@SenSchumer Awesome! Americans can't wait for it to happen because anything else is better than what we have now.
@SenSchumer Stop them!!!
@SenSchumer How about working together for the  common good for all! Insurance and medical care are suffering, big problem!
@JoyAnnReid @donlemon @hardball  TRUMP NEVER HAD A PLAN..LIED!REPS DON'T HAVE A PLAN. LIED! NO HOPE FOR US, CHILDREN, ELDERLY

@SenSchumer Keep ACA...Make Americans Broke Again!
@SenSchumer Bologna! High cost, high deductibles, they have no useable insurance anyway. Also 20 or 30 mill. Get it straight.
America made it perfectly clear what we were sick of on November 8th. Hint it was YOU! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
@SenSchumer Fearmongering #fakenews
How many that was working n paying for their own ended up losing their's because premiums sky rocketed? Punish the working,reward the bums?
Don't listen to Chuck the schmuck, he is as clueless as you are, you both have zero credibility.
is unacceptable that my son can't find a doc within 150 miles
we in RI are proud to have you fighting for health care - any chance RI could enact a MA-style plan if the ACA is killed?
@SenSchumer Hey Chuckie if obamacare is so great why doesnt obama , senate, congess and all federal emp have it? Answer pls
@SenSchumer I wouldn't call that repealing or replacing. He'll never get re-elected.
@SenSchumer really? U 2 r out of touch the premiums r out of this world now with high deductibles thanks to the democrats
Too many Americans will lose
 #MakeAmericaSickAgain.
yea...but that's if they didn't replace it. #fakenews when u don't deduct people who will gain after the plan
Please don't let them take my health care! Been fighting for 3yrs to get SSDI, but can't get Medicare for 2yrs after that.
@SenSchumer - The Democratic Party response: Mass deportations for the last 8 years, abandon Israel and more gun control
@SenSchumer I live in RI Obamacare is the biggest rip off. I no neither of you have to deal with it so you wouldn't no.
what a stupid #! How about#TERM LIMITS!
@SenSchumer TRUE! DONT FORGET ABOUT JOBS, REPEALING ACA, will cause Healthcare collapse, & CAUSE MASSIVE JOB LOSS!!!!
@SenSchumer why don't you fools enroll in Obamacare then?
"Near collapse" would be having Hillary as President. Can't afford "The Affordable Care Act". What  a joke....
U NO THAT IS WHAT @SpeakerRyan IS GOING TO AVOID&THAT PROMISES OF O'CARE DID NOT COME TRUE!LIES! @realDonaldTrump
It's repeal and "REPLACE". Guess you guys forgot that part.
@SenSchumer First #ACA was covering 45M then 40M then 30M now 22M. Lies to pass it lies trying to keep it
like the rest of Congress don't have to have Obamacare, they exempted themselves from this debacle and get better insurance.
Listen to Reps healthcare ideas & point out specific problems.Americans want evidence not children running our country
@SenSchumer Chuck, I knew u were narrow minded, but hadn't realized you had drank the kool-aid. GOP plan will save $ #Plzstop
@SenSchumer  Stop intervening so much in private lives.
@SenSchumer and how many Americans lost jobs due to Obamacare? Americans wouldnt be so sick if they loved a healthy lifestyle
@SenSchumer The masses aren't all dumb Trumpsters. The rest of us are appalled at GOP and stance on Obamacare.
@SenSchumer GOP cronies act if their jobs are secure. They are NOT. Reminder old men: you work FOR PEOPLE NOT CORPORATIONS!
can we see this plan you are talking about? seems they haven't written it yet, so you are lying
@SenSchumer GOP old crony white men sitting in their ivory towers not caring about The People. But men...not gods!!
if it is so good then why is congress exempt from ACA?
@SenSchumer i bet rex tillerson will still have insurance. 180 million$ retirement.
@SenSchumer @SenWhitehouse thay will destroy this country
costs of medical care. So if all can agree this is what is needed then she take away mandate that states everyone must have
have the same coverage when I don't need what you need 2 we keep kids on parent's insurance until 26 3 we 6\7
lower cost and more coverage by insurance co. Instead of having deductible s of 12,000 before insurance pays anything 4\5
from 30 mil our goal while working WITH Democrats is to have insurance for all 60 mil Republicans and All Americans want 3\4
ur Democrat only Obamacare gave 30 mil Americans insurance but has taken away health coverage 2\4
1. You are regurgitating the party line. 2. The "coverage" is a sham. 3. What about the millions who lost their coverage. Hypocrite. Liar.
I beg to differ with ur conclusion our replacement plan will give free enterprise the opportunity to work for Americans. 1\4
