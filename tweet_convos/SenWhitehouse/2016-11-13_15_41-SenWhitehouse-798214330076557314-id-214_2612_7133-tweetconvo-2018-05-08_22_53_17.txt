Where was Kate for the past 8 years?
Cohen would have rolled over in his grave if he knew you used this for your political machinations.
Right then, what u meant was the black girl is ugly.....NO soup for u ya nazi bastard, ur banned
= enraptured by your apparent, infinite talents, and by your choice:  "Hallelujah!" Just bowled over . . . love, love!
SUPER LAME
Kate McKinnon's solid rendition will never be lost.. It will out last this current Chaos & It will soar into the Cosmos..../`*
Ummm... less than half
maybe you should have that taken care of
glad to hear it
-I was devastated. Thank you for the beautiful send off for Kate McKinnon's character of Hillary. She will always be a class act.
who knew Kate was so talented???
People are calling out Saturday Night Live's "Hallelujah" Opening: A Bunch of B.S and an #EmptyGesture
People should be more worried on how trump, Russia, and the GOP RIGGED OUR ELECTION!! More important!
SWEET
@Salina_Wilde_P this was a great show
beautiful love her
@nixie2124 t'was epic
since when did this show become so blatantly left-leaning politically? Keep your opinions quiet & try to be funny!
Just don't watch the show trumpkin troll noodle! Just like I don't watch the big orange toolbag when he's on TV!
Loved this So moving. I cried.
And then the mighty ship went dark, and rolled gently under the waves. Bah-bye SNL I don't have time to make unfunny girls feel good
OMG This is such a painful joke. did it occur 2 SNL that good majorities outside NYC and Hollywood are breathing sighs of relief.
loved this
So beautiful!! I got tears during #KateMcKinnon's #Hallelujah performance  @nbcsnl #RIPLeonardCohen #SNL #ImNotGivingUpAndNeitherShouldYou
I have rarely seen a more pathetic SNL skit. A good number of americans are giddy Clinton got stomped outside nyc/ca

Your silence all these years was consent.  Now it's someone you don't like, you might finally speak up. https://youtu.be/XOXol8TBaYs 
smh
Thank you for this powerful piece. Music lives on and keeps spirits alive.  Hope and motivation to keep pushing for love and peace.
Would love if you'd offer a download of this with the proceeds going to charity. It'd be an honor to support and buy it.
This was absolutely brilliant, Kate, so amazing, expressed what most of us feel, truly sincere sorrow.
#notgivingup #cohenleonard
DISAPPOINTED in SNL...completely disrespecting MILLIONS of TRUMP SUPPORTERS!  Not a GOOD MOVE
 "I'm not giving up and neither should you" 
That was brilliantly done!  Had me in tears. Thank you, Kate Mckinnon!

Funniest shit ever!!!  Kate was awesome in Ghostbusters, but this was hilarious!
@robertAbooey You need to have Kate McKinnon on the show.
Awesome, beautiful, and inspiring
Congrats to Kate McKinnon and SLN for allowing so many to mourn and honor two sad losses in such a dignified way. Brava! Class Act
Finally, a song I don't want to get out of my head! Kate has kicked 3 Dog Night's "..Jeremiah was a bullfrog" once & for all.#SNL
Ya know, the show was actually FUNNY at one time right?  Maybe if you went back to comedy it'd help?
This is perfection. Thank you, SNL.
is there somewhere online where we can buy the audio of this?
this is typical of why trump won.Acting like election was a terrorist attack?!?!Lorne clean house with these out of touch whiners!
If you hadn't given racist Trump a hosting spot on SNL, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess. You are partly to blame.
#Kate McKinnon brought me to tears with this opening.  So moving. An amazing talent. Thank you for helping the healing. 
The #KateMcKinnon cold opening & #DaveChappelle monologue on #SNL began to heal America. Thank you. #ChappelleonSNL #SNLHealsAmerica
amazing!!!
 #Imstillwithher  #HillaryClinton @HillaryClinton
Was that an apology for normalizing a racist? Too late
love this girl#Whatcantshedo!#heracting
gave me gas
great salute to cohen, but really SNL, you have to be so dramatic because Trump won, while you guys were obviously against him #lame
@McKinnonFANS ..Im such a fan of yours..Ms. Kate...you have me explode in laughter watching you...you are to too darn fun...e
well done SNL and Kate. i thought it was a fitting end to a very contentious presidental battle.
except: HRC aka the devil spawn doesnt speak HALLELUJAH.
What a damn joke! What song in Hillary costume will you sing when she is convicted for all her crimes? Folsom prison blues? #Idiots
@stuartenyt liking something on social media is NOT the same as voting
Worth it
So weak. The Mexicans-Americans I know are terrified because of what Trump promised *before* you had him host. You enabled him.
:Next week, Jay Leno will open #SNL with a performance of Mozart's "Requiem".

Good singer but completely up her own ass.
why?
so the comment at the end of "I am not quitting nor should you", are you encouraging the riots to continue?
Never Giving Up. #IWillAlwaysBeWithHer
thanks wonderful way to say keep it up be a watchman and see the fool falls over his own feet not mine eyesclear hearthurt
she sounds really sad HILLARY lost
still whining!
Is she a robot? Really? That funny and beautiful and she can sing too! Give the rest of us a break Kate!
The Powerful Moment When 1500 People Sing Leonard Cohen’s ‘Hallelujah’ Together https://powerofhumans.com/2016/07/inspiration-powerful-moment-1500-people-sing-hallelujah-together/ … via @powerofhumans

Consider@HillaryClinton for next week's episode. And nicely done with this past Saturday's episode.
Could you just moderate the haters on your page, please?
Excellent Performance!  Did you know that you could go onto http://change.org . & sign the petition not to have Trump defeated!
Thank you so much...really needed this. #katemckinnon made me sob actually.  Will never forget this.
beyond beautiful, loving tribute to 2 who gave their all
RIP Leonard Cohen and Hilary's campaign, but this was just odd.
I don't watch SNL for political commentary. Just be funny. Is that too much to ask?
@katemckinnon amazing & beautiful rendition. sings verse "I did my best, it wasn't much...' that broke me down!  #NeverGiveUp
She is no singer and SNL is a COMEDY show. You're not too big to lose viewers. Get over yourselves and get back to making us laugh.
Thank you for that. That was outstanding. Kate McKinnon did an awesome job.
it was very powerful and emotional .
Uh, no. I'll watch #KateMcKinnon and #SNL help get #Trump elected: https://youtu.be/CndSYBUPuuY  #sanctimonious #pontificating #celebrity
She's got mad talent. Depressing, but skills.

,@nbcsnl Its really over for U, .@nbc  .@accesshollywood .@TheAcademy .@CNN ,etc due 2 your BS re: .@realDonaldTrump
starting the Trump 2020 reelection campaign already, I see. #sanctimonious #smug #SNL
Been watching for all 42 years. This episode was on point and historic on so many levels. Kate McKinnon you made me weep.
Yeah, but as Hillary Clinton, not as herself. Awkward.
Haunting...
Aww How sweet you should've had the Real Hillary do it, Blubbering her LOST Election! Hahaha LMAO #SNL Still Sucks
you owe everyone 2:57 of there life back that was the stupidest thing I have ever wasted my life on snl has went to 
Love you so much Kate.  You made me cry so much but laugh more. Killed it with RBG, as always
Outstanding statement!
so talented! Always love to see her every week.

@whitneydevlin she was near tears ..it was unusual for #SNL but touching
It was beautiful!
thank you Kate McKinnon.
um can this be on iTunes please. Love her voice and this song. #need
My 9 yo had me play this on repeat until she dozed off tonight. Turns out, we both needed this comfort. Amazing performance, Kate.
thank you so much for the cold open
@McKinnonFANS funny stuff
loved  it,   and   quite  appropriate  that Kate McKinnon   perform that  song
you're right fuck the Democratic process #nbc fan the flames of hate
worst show on planet now - not funny and very racist.  a liberal swamp
.@nbcsnl slow clap for Kate McKinnon!!!!
Member when Saturday Night Live was funny.
#ChappelleOnSNL WOW! THANK YOU SNL & #KateMcKinnon for this magnificent piece honoring my hero & champion @HillaryClinton #ImWithHer
This was so touching and brought tears to my eyes.....just a beautiful tribute. Thank you Kate.
She should have sung. I fought the law but the law won.
I've been humming "Hallelujah" all day. What a great open - a finger on the pulse of HRC supporters - followed by a great show!
simply amazing. #KateMcKinnon touched my soul. #imwithher #HillaryClinton 
Hallelujah
loved it!#imwithher
thank you for this beautiful tribute to my candidate, HRC.
.@nbcsnl got high ratings last night ONLY because 1/2 of us wanted to see them eat humble pie. Guarantee next week ratings tank. #NotFunny
Kate McKinnon did a beautiful job with this.  Brought me to tears. 
By far, the best SNL in years. Congrats to Dave Chappelle.
could you send me the chords
RT @LindaDStrawser Kate McKinnon brought tears to my eyes - I'm guessing I'm not the only one!
Thank Kate McKinnon we needed that. Well done!
@McKinnonFANS Beautiful 
beautifully done!

Gag me. The woman is a criminal, ok? She is no hero, or inspiration 2 women, or 2 anyone else for that matter.
powerful... perfect... 

that was really not necessary. Not all of us are delicate snowflakes. Some of us enjoy seeing "you people" squirm
snl insulted republicans & the whole rep party! Done watching.its not like when Gilda,Jane & Jon Belushi were there.#longtimefanbye
.@nbcsnl @michaelsergel I performed Helleluja at kareoke day of Cohen's death in New Zealand,after earthquakes,song keeps popping into head
@lpvrsemt I love her now.
over it 
You always strike the right cord with the difficulties we face. Thank you, and Kate.....WOW!
just watched it AGAIN..Magnificent!
You nailed it last night!  Perfect beginning!
map says it all.  HRC never had a chance.
Deeply moving. A wonderful tribute to Leonard Cohen & a call for hope. Well done Kate. Thank you #SNL
Your left adgenda is showing.  Media bias like this helped lead to the election results. Pat yourselves on the back.
So was this a skit or a serious performance 

Absolutely blown away! Best cold open ever! KATE! RIP Cohen and America...
I also watched Ghostbusters yesterday. My Late McKinnon crush is officially out of control.
Welcome in our world :-D
so beautiful
OMG  that was beautiful and so appropriate Kate I love  ya
gif
Nice that if we have to have protests, it's with different races on one side. A melting pot of discontent; I'll see it as progress.
cried like a baby but thank you
Perfect.
@McKinnonFANS stunning
It was beautiful and just what I needed after a really shitty week.  Thank you SNL and Kate McKinnon....
Shitty week ? That was an awesome week.
#weak
This is your best opening ever. Perfect in every way
this was everything today. Kate is my hero. Started the process of healing my wounded soul.
It was beautiful. Thank you
love Kate so much 
SNL has not been funny for years.  Lost a viewer after being completed biased in this election.  Pathetic!
 this
Beautifully done.
So beautiful, brilliant... Kate had me in tears. No we won't give up.

if kate mckinnon ran for president I would have voted for her :-)
that was awesome!!!
loved it, the entire show! Thank youuu!

this was unbelievable- her talent is amazing!!
the only time SNL ever made me cry. And that's a good thing. Bravo to you all and Kate. Perfect.
@_mjonsey
Beautiful performance. Nailed it.
BEST SONG EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

God bless you, dearest, dearest Kate
when you can't shelve your bullshit politics for 3 minutes to pay tribute to a deceased artist.
This was medicine to my soul. Thank you
God Bless...moved me to tears
still waiting dor the punch line
I love this SO much, I can't watch it enough. This was a genius decision for the opening. #thankyou #ifeelatinybitbetternow
thank u for making me understand that I need asshats like u to help me think
@crazykid4354
I don't think you did this song the justice it deserved. @aliciakeys should have sung this soulful song. Missed opportunities. 
You entirely missed the point.
I heard the point sung in church this morning. Not by a woman dressed as Hillary Clinton on a comedy show.
This was meant to help us heal as a nation.  It was very appropriate that she sung the song as Hillary.
I don't mean any ill will. If this song helped u in any way so be it. To me, it's a whole different meaning and substance.
I was very impressed that a non singing comedian could pull this thing off while playing piano.
There's a ton of singers who could have belted it, but that wasn't the point.  Not last night on that show.
How ironic... SNL helped Trump look like a fun guy last year... With great ratings come great responsabilities I guess.
I loved it
