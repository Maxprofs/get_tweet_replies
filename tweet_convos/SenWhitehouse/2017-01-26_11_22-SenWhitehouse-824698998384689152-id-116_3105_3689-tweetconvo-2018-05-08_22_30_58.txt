You loony leftists make me laugh. Elections have consequences.  Put on your big boy pants and face facts.  You lost. :-)
The Constitution has consequences as well- one being a system checks and balances. #AmericanGovernment101
That's funny.  Now that your  "lord and savior" Obama is gone, you "care" about the Constitution.
@SenSanders @EPA Doesn't changing EPA regs change the playing field? Companies who comply competing with new who don't?
Thank you, Senator Whitehouse.
@SenSanders @EPA There is nothing Mr Whitehouse can do to stop the Whitehouse just sit back and let the "Adults" fix things.
what we need is a no vote.
I agree!
@SenSchumer @EPA why couldn't you do something about radical Islamic terrorist
Lies and obfuscation and batshit dodges like grizzly bears should get IS THAT YOUR ANSWER TO THE PPL OF THE STATE OF __
@SenSchumer @EPA @SenWarren Sure, but @SenateDems must STOP voting Yes for Trump's nominees. FIGHT god damn it.
I seriously doubt if ANYONE could find a worse choice for this job. This guy is a JOKE
Each of you should carefully introduce yourself with "I am," "I am here today for the people of," population etc
@SenSanders @EPA We must all rise up against Pruitt. He is greedy,ignorant and dangerous. Call your Senators! #climatefacts
These appointees don't get that they are SPEAKING TO THE PEOPLE through their elected representatives.
folks neither whining senator has the votes. Pruitt will do a gr8 job reigning in out of control epa!
These nominees are gaming all of you. Not integrity.
Please do not vote for Pruitt, or any of the others that ridiculous"President" has put forth. Thank you!
Hey UpChuck...I guess you haven't looked up the difference between MAJORITY..and MINORITY yet. You should!
@SenSchumer @EPA if you spent as much time working instead of marching you could afford your own birth control.
:Best!Don’t look now: It’s President Pence! Donald Trump can be deposed, even without impeachment:
: 
Why Impeach Donald Trump:
Bernie, we need Sheldon to advocate at home in RI against the fracking plant in Burriville. None of us want it!
Are you going to Vote No to confirm him? Go on record Senator and REALLY oppose the destruction of America's EPA
15k heads to be cut at job costing epa
MAKE SURE YOU VOTE NO!
:There's already a campaign to impeach Donald Trump:Yeh,impeach The F*unscrupulous Gangster&Staff http://college.usatoday.com/2017/01/24/theres-already-a-campaign-to-impeach-donald-trump/ …
We need someone who understands science and facts.  Thanks.
And we need a senator who doesn't vote for Trump's nominees....
:The campaign to impeach President Trump has begun: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/01/20/the-campaign-to-impeach-president-trump-has-begun/?utm_term=.579eb9dc2d33 …
Thank you for helping to protest the health of the American people.
Any democrat voting yes in their confirmation is dead to me and will never vote them into office again.
@SenSanders @EPA NO
That health guy wants to cut SS and Medicaid, this can't not stand or is it normal.
It's normal for GOP to want to privatize Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid but not close to doing it.
Rex just want to line his pockets with more money from oil and gas.
@SenSanders @EPA  please, Senator Whitehouse speak for your constitients against Invenergy!  We need your help here in RI!
The EPA wants to destory the climate, the DeVos character wants to destroy  schools, enough is enough.
@SenSanders @EPA  save EPA!!!!
They all need to be blocked. None of them are sane, save maybe Mattis.
We need someone who believes in what science teaches us.  Not someone who will just go along with Trump
@SenSanders @EPA we need an EPA head who is rational. Not one who dives into alternative facts.
Vote no. Talk to Repubs and convince them to vote no. Country over party. We need action, not just talk.
How about you tell him by voting no? more effective than a retweet.
Obviously he's going to do both.
