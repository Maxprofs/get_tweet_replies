@typaulhus @BreitbartNews Stick to the weather, Weather Channel. We want your forecasts, not your fantasies. #maga.
seems like you want your ideas validated, and are not interested in science or fact. Sorry.
Just because it comes out of your mouth doesn't make it fact, truth or science.
He's got the weight of all the scientists who weren't paid off behind him.
The carbon exchange will be just as lucrative as any stock exchange. Follow the money.
Exactly, that's why climate denial is being pushed by power mongers.
and 40 years ago we were all going to starve because of global cooling
40 years ago, SCIENCE wanted to melt the Arctic to save us from global cooling  @Newsweek http://denisdutton.com/newsweek_coolingworld.pdf … 
.@scribeofsolomon @weatherchannel 

My 1975 'Cooling World' Story Doesn't Make Today's Climate Scientists Wrong
The "consensus" 40 years ago said we were cooling. They were wrong then. So why can't they be wrong now?
The guy who wrote the article you posted disagrees with you. I think You're done here.
Ya'll think you know some shit! Ha I have a God that'll tell you different whether you believe in Him or not!
God revealed science to us as a tool for Salvation.  Reject science, reject Him
HA HA HA  Your science has NOTHING to do with Godf You've already rejected Him!
You've decided all this about Bobby based on one tweet? Are you nuts or something?
4 every idiot that thinks this is political & boycotts, several sane people will watch
Those that believe in global warming are not in YYC Canada nowt!! -20C with a -31 windchill
cold weather doesn't mean climate change isnt happening, Sue. It may be cold in Canada but Arctic is experiencing record warmth.
I hope it was sarcastic, but in case it wasn't, Climate Change doesn't mean God gets rid of wintertime in Calgary...
You can ski in Toronto today, thats all that matters. Those pesky glaciers were annoying anyway.
@South_of_I10 @BreitbartNews isn't the weather channel owned by Turner? CNN hacks infiltrated WC too?
@Andy @BreitbartNews Using your own video to discredit. Hilarious!!
Nonsense @weatherchannel 
Under Obama NASA & NOAA back "adjusted" cooling trends to surface warming  @BreitbartNews
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/10916086/The-scandal-of-fiddled-global-warming-data.html …
Expect under TRUMP the NASA & NOAA data reported by @weatherchannel will get sharply cooler again @BreitbartNews
please dont mislead Americans by using 100 yrs of temp data to suggest humans are cause.  Statistically insignificant
. Boy, are you uninformed and uneducated
, stop throwing your political agenda out at us, just stick with @JimCantore and thundersnow...@BreitbartNews
Science is at its core apolitical. Hurricanes don't care if you voted Trump or HRC
Remember all those horrible hurricanes they said would happen after Katrina? Me neither
Models predict it in Atl basin but interannual var. in SST means we wont see it at certainty for another ~50yr
I don't deny climate change but mankind will either kill themselves by that or by some other unintended consequence
maybe we kill ourselves by trying to avoid killing ourselves
How much data did you have to get rid of to make your nice chart? Because that isn't all of it!

Unfair to bring up facts.
liberals 
Science.
fantasy
gravity is also fantasy you are actually floating in your mother-aunt's womb rn


Hey, me too!  Guess he had his little feelings hurt. Doesn't that mean he's a snowflake? 
guy needs a safe space
you idiots it was infact an AUTOMATED video imbed at their website, not by choice but by paid ADVERTISING
that google ad sense or some firm felt "fit there" due to a similiar topic being discussed.
So write your complaints to whomever YOU guys pay for advertisements NOT Breitbart
Wow...wcis
@CaptainsLog2017
Ultimate forecast: The weather will continue to change on and off for a long, long time.
plse have your expert come talk 2 @StefanMolyneux  #TruthRising @BreitbartNews  @realDonaldTrump https://youtu.be/WyXtr4DBUd8 
why, he's not a meteorologist.
@deray @BreitbartNews BOYCOTT THE WEATHER!
@KatyTurNBC @BreitbartNews breaking news for all trump supporters. The world has been scientifically proven to be round.
@RogerPielkeJr Maybe a warmer Earth is a good thing? Longer growing season etc. More people die from Xcold.
is more flooding good?  More extreme storms?  More droughts?  You're way off base.
I see many of you need to read @RogerPielkeJr column from the Weekend WSJ.
so many science challenged Americans. But it doesn't matter...science doesn't care if you believe it or not.
Which is why anthropogenic global warming is nonsense.  When the facts don't support a theory, it is wrong.
plz come to a college/scientific community & say that id love to see my professors tear u & ur "facts" a new asshole
literally afraid 2 call the name, but he has a God: that may suggest he observe and contemplate a bit more
damn Trump is boss. His dumb ass followers now think The Weather Channel is fake news!! #moronbehaivor
How does time affect climate?
When new York and Florida are under water and the east coast drowns maybe then people will believe it, trumpet voters never SAD
Those who won't accept climate change can't accept change. Change needs effort, flexibility, & hope.
Is this graph using the real data? Or what NASA tried to pass off as the real data? #FakeNews #HoaxMedia
I still want to know how we escaped the ice age

Did the dinosaurs cause #GlobalWarming too?
Note to @weatherchannel: that graph is utter garbage, from known purveyors of pseudoscience & cooked data. It’s fake. @BreitbartNews
You're confusing it with the Breitbart graphs. Skeptical Science is known for accuracy.
LOL! Don’t be absurd.
I'm not. Unless you think agreeing with climatologists about their area of expertise is absurd.
Because a PhD Physicist can’t tell good science from bad science? And they spread bad science.
Climatologists know climatology better than physicists do. And they recommend the site.
You don’t know what you’re talking about, clearly. Climatology is largely data analysis.
And I trust the climatologists to do it. Because it's their job.
Weather is not climate.
What is weather if not climate! Ya;ll are some screwed up people!
If you're attacking @weatherchannel and defending @BreitbartNews in this thread, you understand neither journalism nor science.
Says someone who believed the "scientific polling" that Hillary would win.  #projecting
Someone tell whoever is running the @fr3esp3ak3r sockpuppet to at least de-egg the profile cc @weatherchannel
So much #butthurt you poor precious #safetypinhead.  #TrumpWon.  Do you need a hanky?
:)
@Ferri16_S @BreitbartNews 
There have been at least 5 known ice ages on this planet. Guess what happened after each one ??

The climate is always changing.  Stop using these facts for any political point.
Why are you telling the weather channel? Breitbart news needs to be told that.
Says the people who believed Hillary Clinton would win based on "scientific polling".
What the fuck is it with people and dragging politics into everything?
Anthropogenic global warming is all about politics.
All of the following scientists disagree
Climate change is real.  Anthropogenic global warming isn't.  Facts, my dear, facts.
And your data to show that there isn't a strong correlation is?
Skeptical Science (see bottom right corner) uses cooked datasets:
The Deplorable Science Blog is surely not biased, narrowcasting or pandering for clicks.
You can repeat it yourself http://woodfortrees.org/ 
How can this site look so shite if he is a software developer? Republicans need some web developers!
Republicans, huh? Yeah, you're an apolitical scientist. I suggest you start your science quest here: http://tropical.atmos.colostate.edu/Includes/Documents/Publications/gray2012.pdf …
Never said I was apolitical. "Deplorable" is associated with a political mindset now though. Evaluate depictions relatively.
Steve Goddard turns many such things on their head. Use of deplorable is tongue-in-cheek. He knows what he's doing.
The only thing he is turning is people away by using a word associated with political memes.
@SenWhitehouse @BreitbartNews Lues lies and more lies. To mislead Americans.
to what end?
Ask Shelly.
never mind I guess.
Ok. You're an asshole. BLOCKED
Anthropogenic catastrophic global warming is #fakenews Weather Channel.  Fact.
can we please get a chart going back past 1965?  Looking at this over the past 40 years is not relevant.
40 years is short, but relevant. Here is the last century. @weatherchannel @BreitbartNews
@Anthony @BreitbartNews You haters realize that if you're wrong and we didn't do anything we die, right? Not worth a chance?
If we created the problem....don't we deserve the consequences?
Exactly, so suck it up everyone and quit your damn whining
So climate change is real after all and we deserve to die
Changes from what? Do tell, what is the climate supposed to be exactly?
The climate is changing...always has. The question is, does alarmist rhetoric move the world to alternative energy?
Agreed, we don't control it. Creating a "carbon credit market" is a scam that makes Al Gore and elites rich
If you don't get China and India on board, the point is moot. (2)
news alert The climate changes 4 times a year
@baggins_fr @BreitbartNews in the 70's it was new ice age coming 80's- 90's global warming now just climate change! lol
of course the climate is changing. It's just not man that is causing it to change.
.@jaketapper @BreitbartNews Note to @weatherchannel ,stop using strawmen,climate change is real,but notion it's MAINLY caused by people ISNT
lol. Good one!
bless up weather channel
To be fair, you guys always fail with your weather predictions. Both of you can be just as bad. @weatherchannel @BreitbartNews
@CanadianGreens @BreitbartNews 

That sound you hear is the Minoans, Romans & Vikings laughing their very warm assess off.
Excellent job Weather Channel!  After all, this should be about Science not politics.
@JeremyWard33 @BreitbartNews I'd like to see the charts going back to 3000 BC to see if it's flat up until 1965
Thank You Weather Channel for facing ignorance with FACTS.
Liars.
we that agree with the weatherchannel have 3 digit IQ's & can read. Breitbart is a comic book pandering to 2
that PLANTS DOMINATE THIS EARTH, and ALWAYS HAVE. THEY USE CO2. So if we say, "We need to change everything
The Weather Channel is owned by NBC. Go figure, love the politics. How abt the weather?
"Lets make the FACTS louder than the OPINIONS"!!! Weather Channel is the new champion of TRUTH for the world!
can not sustain balance or even recover @weatherchannel @BreitbartNews
Trend warmer? Yes. However, 40yrs ago ice age was eminent. 150yrs of data out of 2Bill is miniscule.

Thank you weather channel for clearing this up!
Yes, climate change is real and real serious!!
How about you go back a couple centuries and show the cyclical heating and cooling of the Earth before industrialization?

Fine but can we borrow your copy of "Born in the USA?"
@jaketapper from the 90's into the 2000's we had 17 years of no warming & concensus is we will start a cooling trend
Record snows in Nov in Austri, Sweden, France. BTW your reality shows? they effing suck ass
@isabellegirlxo @BreitbartNews True! Climate change is real! It does! However, the 'science' In Global Warming is False!
Climate dispatch put a report out that sea temps have cooled the past month at the fastest rate in history
"complex and subtle" solutions, to address the complex n subtle issues- Y do u insist ona blanketed solution?
thank you please keep at it. Be vocal tell the truth!!!! Millions more will be looking to you as an honest source.
And btw- during a low solar activity period, its PROVEN to lower temps. Sorry. But we see the PROOF now.
It looks like the new keeper believes is a Hoax.... but smart people got the facts right and it is REAL...

@PaulBegala @BreitbartNews @ThePeakyBlinder @Lawrence The changes in the climate r true Now who is the dummy?
Not misleading: WeatherChannel co-founder John Coleman says Climate Change is a HOAX: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQshyqCLYHo …
Thank you !!!
of natural cycles, the factors and mechanisms already in place, and how they change when triggered. So why
N the mechanisms that allow plants to grow MUCH more efficiently, seem to have THEIR OWN cycle. The REALissue
Can someone pls explain aerosols keeping California dry? Someone? Anyone? Hurting us!
We knw itz REAL but sadly Climate deal agreement betwn contries is just High level CORRUPTION & EyeWash!
They Only Wanted A Excuse To Stop American Growth With Regulations To Give Mfgr Industry To Other Countries
Climate change is real. It has been happening for a billion yrs.
facts have a liberal bias
Breitbart is not interested in science, they view everything as a liberal vs conservative. Facts are facts.
31,000 scientists disagree WC. Who owns you?
I just loved this vid.  Was nice to see someone defend actual facts for once.

Even after Climategate fraud you persist

Promoting climate hoaxers is the definition of #FakeNews

This isn't news. It is a propaganda machine for big business oil companies and promotion of hate and racism.
You tell em! Maybe they can understand pictures?
just wonder, can we simply detonate a few volcanoes each year for cooling?
fake news, fake science and you ppl fall for it every time.
Money is good, isn't it?
You cant fix Stupid, hence Breitbart, Curt the Shill, and most of the people on their forums are hopeless.

OUR planet. B/c we only have ONE. And if we JUMP into disrupting cycles we truly dont understand in their
nut jobs. Climate change is bs, a sham scam and is a damn lie! you channel is full of aholes that broadcast
not even 1 degree in 50 years... what a drastic change
how would people conclude cooling? What I see is that La Nina/El Niño oscillation happens but  trend in temp
@CindyLeinwand12 @BreitbartNews #infowars @PrisonPlanetTV Climate change is a made up money maker. Weather goes in cycles

Thank you weather channel! I'll check the weather twice as often this month.
if i wanted your in put in the climate change scam, i would have asked. Put your politics away @BreitbartNews
hey WC just stick to your forecasts. Most of us couldn't care less what you think about "climate change".

Why does this graph only go back to 1965?
