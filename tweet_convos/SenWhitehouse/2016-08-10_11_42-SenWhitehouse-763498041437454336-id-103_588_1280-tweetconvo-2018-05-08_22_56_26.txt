Elizabeth has lost all credibility. All talk; no walk.
except for her astounding record on helping the poor and middle class.
Agencies that don't really DO anything don't really mean anything.
It actually does a lot to help protect consumer rights. Just admit you are wrong.
I think its intentions are right but the success of it is minimal at best. #AllTalkNoWalk
