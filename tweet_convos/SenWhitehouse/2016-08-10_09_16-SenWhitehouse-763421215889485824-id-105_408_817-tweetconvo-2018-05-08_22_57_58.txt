it's troubling to learn how much $$ to the Clinton foundation comes from corps like occidental
that's where you find the money. If you want money you go where it's at. Like all  politicians.
Bernie needed tons of money.. He went where it was too...  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  See how that works
and this is charity work not campaigning.
charity work?   OMG LOL. Do you happen to work for David Brock.
but of their corruption may actually help someone.
this is why so many voters do t understand your full throated endorsement of her
demoncrats are proven liars party of slavery,control,oppression
that's just how dems see republicans. And how I see both. Interesting.
how innovative, a person claiming 1st A US Const rights now has the burden of proof. Classic JJA
this is how the Democratic Party leads the masses into surrendering protected rights JJA MO
.@SenWarren @SenWhitehouse @GOP Gee, Liz, I really don't give af what you think anymore. Credibility is be earned. You wasted yours.
@BethCol77455974 @SenWhitehouse @GOP
How can we believe anything you say?  You support the epitome of everything bad in politics!
How does Anything you say have credibility anymore when you've turned a blind eye to an illegitimate Primary?
it's as legitimate as they are supposed to be.
As .@HillaryClinton "...is as transparent as (she) knows to be..."
@washingtonpost like HRC & DWS rigged the primary against Bernie ?
SHUT DOWN BIG POLLUTION. The people who protect their own extinction
and now we have to watch their bs TV ads about their passion for renewable energy. YUCK! Boo hiss to Exxon.
Wait- the party that wants to change the law to limit speech is going to lecture? OK there, Fauxchontas
@washingtonpost Pocahontas is a ugly dangerous human being and don't let her get around the whiskey
you said you wished Trump would "disappear" that is a VIOLENT statement for his abduction and assassination!
it's not the GOP doing the attacking, it's big money like the Kochs
#TrumpPence16 #JillNotHill #BernieOrGreen #NeverHillary #MAGA @realDonaldTrump
No. 
Lie-A-Watha Warren concerned about "states rights"?  I do believe I have now seen everything under the sun.
Maybe you should donate to Clinton Foundation, to get what you need?
@washingtonpost  Democrat party,CORRUPT
@washingtonpost YOUR JUST AS MENTAL AS KILLARY
Are you going to support @realDonaldTrump?We should do everything in our power to stop @HillaryClinton ,Please back our party
@SenWarren @SenWhitehouse @GOP
attack on free speech? Where have U been. Look at what's going on at all the leftist colleges! #1A oppression
@washingtonpost
Watch this instead...
I wouldn't read anything you suggested!!!
@washingtonpost Then why do you accept their money, hipocrite?
@washingtonpost 
And watch:
Clinton Cash
Hillary, The Movie
Hillary's America
Docs are true or could not show
@washingtonpost OK, but it is time for an organized new flank on the down ballet w/ Bernie. Prog. Gov't. Now.
@washingtonpost After endorsing @HillaryClinton you portend the dangers posed to free speech? #hypocrasy
you start by calling out carbon pollution,it's CO2,plants depend on it producing O2 for us to breathe,goofy
oh hillary likes that money oil makers give her. look into clinton foundation
@washingtonpost 
Hey pocahontas it was your party that would not let the bernie supporters talk.
@washingtonpost  warren thought you back HRC. She's the one in the pockets of oil .Obama against state rights
well u guys would know
Warren you should be careful of you bed partner you may find yourself dead at HRC feets like many seem to be
You are big on freedom of speech but not on bearing arms. The 2nd guarantees the 1st.
and the dnc rigged the nomination. Stop with the double standard
Ms. Warren, Iwas disappointed that Hiliary didn't choose U asher VP. I guess u weren't good enough2 her
@washingtonpost 
Hey Pocahontas...did the Obama Administration not do the same for green companies?
Lizzy you remain a Hillary reject and a person in need of attention. You do get Pity and Laughter.
@SenWarren @SenWhitehouse @GOP
Poor Liz.. She's actually delusional! Only the dems want every word PC & guns banned! GOP=FREEDOM!
You aren't a native American and carbon dioxide isn't a pollutant.
let us be clear, both sides of aisle corrupt and manipulating on behalf of themselves and their interests
@washingtonpost Where's your Op-Ed about Clinton & DNC's attacks on free speech & states' rights for big oil?
WARREN-REICH 2020

Thanks for discussing issues!  Quite refreshing.
@washingtonpost

Shocking number of idiots on here. Pollution SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN. NOT A political choice!!
#Goofy Rigging the system? Look who's the expert 
why does everyone hate warren now?
WE SHOULD BE 1 STATE, NOT 50!!!
It's just bizarre that you would support someone that has destroyed countries, murdered, money laundering & corrupt to the bone.
this is not a fraud investigation. It's an effort to silence people who don't agree with you. Disgusting
So your true colors? Too bad.
more hot flashes from the menopause madam
@washingtonpost no longer interested in anything you have to say
@washingtonpost Now you want to stand on the #10thAmendment? You are such a partisan hack! #Pocahontas
Goofy is distorting the facts again!
@SFL4Hillary
@SenWarren @SenWhitehouse @GOP
How cold was the gun The Clintons had held to your forehead? @SenWhitehouse @GOP @washingtonpost

Good Morning Pocahontas.
