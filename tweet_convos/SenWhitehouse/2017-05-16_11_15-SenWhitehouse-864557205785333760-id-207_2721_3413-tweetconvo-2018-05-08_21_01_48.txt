Yoga appointments are harmless information?
Well said sir
No actually it's not "astounding". Either he is blantly lying or this Senator is an idiot.
The PRESIDENT has every right to declassify.
It puts Israel's spy in ISIS in danger.
Harsh to bad he's not @GOP where they don't seem to be saying anything. U can only hide under your desks for so long.
@eaglesfanjoe_sr
lock him up. Impeachment please
Preach
Sen Whitehouse pretty well sums up the entire situation.
This is the logic fallacy of a false equivalency
Senator has no facts.   Buying into media hysteria.  The left and media are completely out of control.
"As they say, 'The proof is in the pudding.' I reiterate, NOT MY PRESIDENT."
Right along w/Trump is BlueDog fraud HRC selling a Russian Business 1/5 of our Uranium and Bill's 500,000.00 speech he gave them. #SethRich
That would be sanitized intelligence that's been vetted by multiple agencies b4 being released. That didn't happen in this case.
Just how do you know what was said?  Where you there? You don't know anything but what is reported which amount to jack shit.
We don't have the right to decide what the President of the United States deems to be need to know it's his decision to make period.
and totally unbelievable. Where r the gutless GOP
President whitehouse 
Such lies
Your dead wrong,
We need strong trusting ally in Israel in region. But careless n wilful sharing of classified intel w/ Russia is unexceptable n wreckless.
Got To Go!
Hey-and notice that no reporter was arrested because he dared asked the Senator a question.
EXACTLY
I like Senator Whitehouse. He is correct.
Indeed it is Sen!  I am incredulous to this entire so called #45 Presidency. The US must demand immediate resignation

He said the truth and Trump should LOCKED UP
LOL slight difference!

I swear 'karmer' is a BITCH.  Just think about it. It digs deep.
It's treason
Astounding but not surprising.
Just listened to Comey's indictment of Hillary about her server.  Stated that she should have known better, yet he doesn't C intent? Coverup
This traitor is up for re-election in 2018.  Vote him out.  Unite America and get rid of this trash.  His loyalty is not to U, it's party.
The President has the authority to declassify.  Is this news to you?  And if you know it, Y are U disrespecting the President, ignoring law
You can;t compare the President ot the SS.  Comey was the only fool who did not want Hillary arrested.  He deserved to be fired, negligent!
Irony?  There is no comparison.  Hillary distributed thousands of top secret documents.  Trump shared intel which was within his authority.
I couldn't agree with you more senator. The republican senators and house should start speaking out about this too. Stop giving him a pass!
Succinct summary of the last day's event.  No excuse for Trump's blunder except complete arrogance and lack of competence.
"astounding" that D #dishonestMedia such as @ABCPolitics had no outrage when #crookedHillary exposed our country's security
Ask #WIKILEAKS
. #Dad & his son #@The_real_DJT @PutinRF_Eng
Why the silence about Seth Rich?
"Look! No Hands" has morphed into "Look!  No Email Server!"  @realDonaldTrump
He's pretty pissed as are we all!
Thank you @SenWhitehouse we need our leaders to mirror our outrage
Hey Senator where was your anger last year
Soo true
I like this guy, Senator Whitehouse of RI. Maybe he should be a contender in 2020 for Democratic nomination. He s got the right name for it.
@CarmelJudeobsc1 @SenWhitehouse The lying media. You've been brainwashed against democracy. See 1st Amendment. As real as 2nd.
Fuckn rite
The difference is the Pres has the ability to declassify as he sees fit, HRC didn't & shared with her assistant & lied about Benghazi
Love it
Where were you when comey was covering for clinton email national scandal, Benghazi attacks and uranium sales to Russia???
Smack
@laureldavilacpa @SenWhitehouse Someone has got to stop this absurdity.  Either one he's complicit or two he's incompetent.
Senator Whitehouse is my new hero...
@realDonaldTrump needs 2 resign, n so do all of his staff that lie 4 him. I remember ever President since Kennedy n by far he is the worse
Yet not a damn thing will be done about it like everything else. If Trump was trying to get impeached the GOP wouldn't let him.
One broke the law the other didn't. You know that Senator. Why do you keep comparing the two? Political posturing?
Q: "And, what does that say about his (Trump) judgement?"
A: "Nonexistent."
Thank you Senator Whitehouse!
Russia must explain how much Hillary received from uranium deal and her accomplished.
You are a left wing propaganda media that has lost all credibility of reporting the facts without a negative bias slant!
Can someone now start to investigate @realDonaldTrump, please? And be sure to tell him he is under investigation.
he wants to get away with whatever he perceives the dems got away with...
#Lockhimup  Lock him up lock him up
Headline: Trump too dumb to get intelligence @realDonaldTrump @CNN @Reuters @politico @Slate @washingtonpost @nytimes @latimes @MSNBC
The irony. I'd have said the chutzpah, the hubris, the blindness, the narcissism.
@RepAdamSchiff @MaxineWaters @SenatorLeahy @SenFranken @SenBlumenthal @SenFeinstein @ericswalwell @EricHolder @SenBobCasey @RepCummings
McMaster: It was "wholly appropriate" for @POTUS to share whatever info he thinks is necessary to advance security of the American people.
45 wants to BE a Russian Oligarch so bad. He would give ANYTHING, even to  
DONE !

"Ain't it?"
WHICH CHILD IN THIS WORLD DOES NOT KNOW THE SPY SERVICES OF ISRAEL TO AMERICA IN MIDDLE EAST IN RETURN FOR MASSIVE GOVERNMENT GRANTS
The iron that the good Senator said nothing about Hillary Clinton's email servier security lapses?
What action are you planning, Senator? How about shutting down the senate?
ahahhahahahah i fuckin love this guy??????? @jdgateley
The Dems have cornered the market on irony.
Senator Whitehouse, thank you, you have restored some my faith in government.
Good 4 u @SenWhitehouse!  Ur a true patriot and will get 2 stay in DC bc of it 2!
At least somebody's pissed.
Thank you, Sir, for telling it like it is.
I'd worry more about your insider stock portfolio, Senator. Absolutely shameful behavior from all of you who take advantage.
Really....Clinton's little ole "e-mails" were classified and on her PERSONAL UNSECURED COMPUTER! Whitehouse is a jerk partisan! So is ABC!
Best response I've heard all day! #ImpeachHimNow #resist #russiagate
I say we look at locking him up. The Republicans lack of action is unpatriotic, cowardly, and un-American. What does it take to wake up
Congressman Green get it going now please. Greenlight.
Another Political hack , and so many are DEMS
Speak the truth
Harmless information in Clinton's emails? Do we know that to be the case? And how relevant is that really?
Lest we forget: All HRC emails were internal, until the witch hunt. Secrets were always safe with Hillary.
yeah but she told everybody about the night we smoked weed and had unbelievably wild sex in her dorm room at Wellesley.
exactly! what else is astounding? the GOP's silence
This oh yes a million times yes. We need more honesty like this 
What did expect a liberal to say. Democrats and the liberal news media are so out of touch with America.

Lock him up Lock him up for Trump is mentally unstable and committed treason amoung so many other things

Get him out. Get him help. @IvankaTrump @SenWhitehouse
get him a straight jacket
We don't WORK with Russia. Good Lord. They hacked our election and gave us Trump
THANK YOU @SenWhitehouse THANK YOU.  NOW, can @SenJohnMcCain join in the conversation.  @potus is a danger to this country.
@FreshPhunky @SenWhitehouse 
@SpeakerRyan @SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake @ananavarro @maddow Bet lots of GOP members are thinking same thing!
Who cares what @SenWhitehouse says..he's one of the biggest hypocrite frauds around!
Wish I could retweet this more than once!!!
You have to admit there is an obvious disconnect with Trump's previous pre-election rhetoric and his actions to date as POTUS. #ImpeachNow
Maggie, Sen. Whitehouse, @ABCPolitics 
 THANK YOU FOR THIS !!!


@realDonaldTrump's judgment's been non-existent 4 decades. #LiarTraitorTaxevader is in bed w/ Putin.
Trump's loyalties r with #Russia not US
Very proud of my Senator, @SenWhitehouse .
#LockHimUp - Time for @GOP patriots (if there are any) to #impeachtrump or lose their seats in 2018. Treason is a "high crime"  #trumprussia

BRILLIANT.  Check this out @POTUS @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan
.@SenWhitehouse Mr Senator: I implore you to please GET #TRUMP OUT OF OFFICE IMMEDIATELY. #natsec #urgent #sos
So when are y'all gonna do something about it? #TrumpRussia #impeach
Thank you for standing up! American patriot! 
Btw, I've become a huge fan of @SenWhitehouse. Huge.
"harmless classified" #oxyMORON perhaps
@maggieNYT @SenWhitehouse spot on Senator -Trump (as foretold) "is uniquely unqualified to be President"
@jasoninthehouse For last hurrah y don't u do your job & hold hearings on trump's loose lips?  Or will your new bosses at Fox not like that?
I am so proud of my senator!
Phony outrage.  More bullshit from the left.
Fubar
It s OK because it was His boss he told everything to ,and we Know He Hate s the USA
Nonexistent! Exactly! Unpresidented!
Clinton was stupid in what she did, but it was a drop in the ocean compared to the corrupt fiasco that is all things Trump.
Good Rule of Thumb - if it's a Dumocrat - it's BULLCRAP!
My hero
The fury radiating... we are right there with you, @SenWhitehouse.
He's lying cause his lips are moving
Okay. Starting today we should close the senate and only interview politicians while they are walking around tunnels. So authentic.
I was trying to keep up.
Trump has proven himself to be a fool with a big mouth.

@maggieNYT @SenWhitehouse Exactly how many of us feel.
What does that say about his judgement?  "Non existent ".  Ouch!
Every Senator is thinking the same thing. They need to say it out loud or they are just as much a threat to this country as Trump.
What an A-hole.
It goes way beyond irony to the epitome of hypocrisy.
I was thinking the same
Trump needs to resign
This guy should run for president. His last name is Whitehouse!!!
He is just so massively irresponsible and incompetent. The weak, insecure, lying, incompetent six year old child in the White House. #Trump

Oh, amen.
He's right on all points
There is no irony - Clinton flagrantly broke the law via her private server phones forwarding of emails printouts etc - completely different
DAYMMMMMmmmmmmm
Well said, Senator.  . It is always refreshing to hear your POV on matters that impact our country.  We need more like you!
Yay...Sheldon Whitehouse..
So amazing we have to put up with 45* incompetence
Nice to see him call it like it is. He's right.
So now you think McMasters is a liar? That's rich-#SethRich
I'll retweet as soon as you get a GOP senator to say this...
this is because that idiot in the Whitehouse IS Massivly Irresponsible!!
Where are the GOP voices saying that this is unacceptable? Citizen's United (unlimited money) & gerrymandering are the tools of the fools.
I was thinking criminal
Trump didn't know the "c" meant "classified", so he had no malicious intent. Worked for Hillary.

Reminder: The Telegraph reported in Jan. that U.S. spies 'warned Israel not to share intelligence with Trump' http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/13/us-spies-warned-israel-not-share-intelligence-trump/ …
You're a partisan hack!
Now we chant, #SethRich
Hillary has been in Washington for 25 years.  No excuse her recklessness.
Come on people it abc reporting they are owned by the Richest Elites which Hate Trump it's going to be a Hate fest for years non integrity
respect to @SenWhitehouse.  you have managed to voice my thoughts precisely
