Much like @GovWalker, @BetsyDeVos us an unqualified, radically ideological, religious hack. Both destroy public education for profit.
do u have children? If so, where does ur PS rank nationally? Kids in failing PS, like mine, need her! Plz
I have 4 kids in public schls that were among the best in the nation before @GovWalker started gutting them.
Refresh my memory how not investigating student loan fraud and letting private companies raise interest on student loans make @BetsyDeVos anything but a champion for privatized loan companies

What the hell do you know about education? You & DeVos are enemies of teachers, students and public ed!
What a joke.
@betsydevos was the worst choice. Why can't we get someone really conservative?
DeVos is an ignorant fraud.
delete your account
Bull.
You've gotta be kidding me.. how much did she pay you to say that?
doesn't include Trans student make it clear... and not a generalization. Liar and today DeVos proved it.
Ahh, no. She's in the process of removing protections for students in favor of private charter schools. She also hired a DeVry employee...
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos @usedgov DeVos is a joke at best. Our kids in TN and nationwide deserve better
Both Detroit & MI public schools have SUFFERED because of DeVos! How much $ has she given u?
FACTS not Rhetoric,
Can't wait to get a school voucher so my kids don't have to go to these liberal atheist schools anymore.
Why don't you home school? I'm sure there's a church school nearby.
I work and can't afford private schools. I need a school voucher.
That's why public schools exist. Do more than ask for a voucher. Get involved
I am involved. I'm a school choice advocate. Looks like its about to pay off.  God bless Devos
I want ALL kids to get a good education. I just don't see her doing that.
couldnt agree more B DeVos a class act
@ArtmanJanet @BetsyDeVos @usedgov     
you are delusional if you think @BetsyDeVos is a champion for our students what's wrong with you?
NO NO NO. Why am I a republican. She needs her own education on education.
she's an absolute disgrace to the educational system in America #NotoDeVos
Disagree!!! 
you're delusional...only reason she even got nominated was $200 million+ in donations.
and hundreds of thousand $ to Walker!
having people who are as big of failures as yourself makes you look more average.
nobody supports teachers and students like the great man Scott Walker! #MAGA #PutGunsInSchoolVendingMachines

you're as delusional as trump.
I call bullshit!
.@GovWalker @BetsyDeVos delete your accounts. And resign. Or withdraw.
You misspelled "disgusting, inept predatory oligarch", mate. Common mistake it seems.

@GovWalker @BetsyDeVos @usedgov
my concern is to offer charter before exploring why public edu is failing. How about the devaluing of edu & teachers
Lets add teaching to tests. Kids aren't really "learning" anymore
Yeah, right!!! You must be another scumball just like her and Trump! You are disgusting to support this individual!
's only qualification is her massive donations to Trump. The woman is UNFIT.
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos @usedgov NO one wants her.Listen to the people.
Will his constituents vote him out? TBD....
Oops. Looks like shes not as good a family friend as you thought. @BetsyDeVos @usedgov
Please...Governor what would you know? Look what you did to your people in Wisconsin.
Explain Neurocore

Hey Bets you better go get your gun -no bears on philly. @MaryLittleton @GovWalker @BetsyDeVos @usedgov
I had hoped "Mama Grizzly" would go away with the demise of Sarah Palin.  Ms. DeVos is NOT qualified.  NO!
ZERO qualifications for??
Lies
your kids must not have gone to public schools....
You're correct babysitter high schools...massive truancy
You automatically know this is a bad idea when Walker supports it
Wow @GovWalker! What qualifications leads you to believe this? She has never run a school or school system! @BetsyDeVos #dumpDeVos
He's playing the nasty GOP game.
She's not only unqualified, she is a threat to public education everywhere.
Stop behaving like a bought & paid for fool. If you support DeVos, you chose big money over U.S. CHILDREN.
Seriously?  Quit with the politics and open your eyes please.
Please feel free to answer. Why haven't u sent your own children to public schools? Also, what do u know about Edu?
have you actually seen the nomination hearing? Would you be proud to see devos representing our education system
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos @usedgov Do you have brain damage? She's NEVER been an educator nor worked in the field. #failkids #sad
Worried foreign interest groups(Pearson) will still be in charge & cont 2 neglect majority of students in US
but not trans students apparently. #ProtectTransKids
Oddly, her home state senators, her alma mater, some MI school boards, the @NASSP, @NAACP @NEA @AFTunion among others oppose it
I oppose fake education and alt-science.   I will fight this travesty till they kill me
Amway is a racket. Education is not.
literally one of the worst governors in America endorses you. #DumpDevos #StopDeVos #RESIST #resistdevos
No, she's really not. Our children deserve much better than her. That you all  back her? Disgusting.
You are such a liar Gov Walker
@MIGOP @BetsyDeVos @usedgov you know you don't have to lie all the time right?
She's a billionaire and that's all. Amway is a crooked pyramid scheme.
Sorry, millions of us KNOW Walker is a serial liar & low-educated ideologue. Not impressive.
please tell me you cannot be serious
Walker has been trying to appeal to the extreme right for awhile. Funny thing is it isn't working as evidenced by the last run.
dead wrong. We're screwed. Thanks for convincing a generation not to have kids.
Poor John Inhofe. Like the middle child who only gets the raisin cookie and not the chocolate chip.
How much did Betsy pay you to tweet this? $$
@BetsyDeVos @usedgov
or did they join Trump in the "golden shower"?

Do you support School Choice? 
Yes/No - Why?

I hope ur kids can get all betsy has to offer
#notonethindime of my tax $goes to "charter scam schools." I will fight this travesty till you shut me up.
85/87 replies are negative. Looks like your chances of being reelected next term are bleak.
We remember. And we vote. And based on the number of protests it's not going well. @PleaseExplain6 @GovWalker @BetsyDeVos @usedgov
no she's not she's a shill for corporate greed. #notonethindime
I don't trust @BetsyDeVos to protect students with IEPs. She has shown no understanding nor upholding of IDEA. #sped
WRONG I Trust #BetsyDeVos @SenateGOP CONFIRM #BetsyDeVos #TrumpTrain is WithHer! @SenateMajLdr
Full time Trumpkin? Is that a thing? You CLEARLY need full time therapy. I recommend a residential treatment facility...
A great education leader is shaped by the the children he/she has served in the classroom. She is not qualified.
LYING Gov Walker. DeVoid DeVos is a national disgrace. SHAME on ALL but 2 Republicans.
will she also be Union busting, like you?
and your children go to what private school? What's a vote cost these days?
are you serious?! 
She couldn't answer a single question intelligently. She is a threat to education.
hell no! Neeeever!!
no, no she is not. With statements like this you continue to exhibit #notmyrepublicanparty vote no
great job Scott, do u get a campaign contribution bonus for this tweet?
#boughtandpaidfor
you're joking, right? She has no experience in public education at any level, not as a teacher, administrator, student or parent.
NO! She is a champion of privilege. HOW will she IMPROVE public education??? #NoonDeVos
She is actually one of most unqualified people to ever come before the Senate. But so are all the ppl in WH
Betsy devos is an embarrassment
You suck.....she will destroy public education and create a generation of robots, what repubicans desire.
HIGHLY UNQUALIFIED!  HIGHLY UNWANTED!  HIGHLY UNSUPPORTED!  Your support of DeVos shows your ignorance.
W? Did she donate to your campaign too? 
.@GovWalker @BetsyDeVos @usedgov the people didn't want her, by a large margin.  You have failed to represent us yet again.
LIAR. You have taken public school money away and given to failing charter schools with no accreditation.
it astounds me that your brain can generate enough electricity to keep your ignorant mouth moving
Why does this bitch want to abolish child-labor laws and compulsory school attendance?
which will most likely effect families who cannot easily afford private school for all their kids?
"wants to destroy public schools and funnel tax $ to unregulated religious ones" = odd use of "champion".
she is a champion of for profit charters Our children aren't for sale #DumpDevos
so where is your supporting argument? All I see is BS without any sources cited...
no, she does not have enough real life experience.
NO to DeVos! Not qualified for the job
poor Gov Walker willing to sacrafice our childrens education for a few bucks/partisanship. SAD!
I agree Governor, look forward to briefing you on American Center for Student Run Businesses w/Cardinal MFG.
I mean.. $342,600 later, of course you endorse her. She owns your balls (& integrity) at this point.
What a tool. I fear for my children's education at this point. For shame.
another reason I am ashamed Governor Walker is our Governor. #SorryToOurChildren
Betsy DEVOS is not the right person we need a Humble,educated,respectful human being she is not that person
No sir. She's terrible for education and a classic example of pay for play #NotoDeVos
Wrong!
she is not qualified
I guess money talks more than children's education
I could not be more disappointed in my governor. Shameful.
this is a #alternativefact boy.
Why yes @BetsyDeVos may be a lovely rich belle, however, she bought her #Trump job. Are you a #TrumpAssKisser too @GovWalker ?
I suppose you owe her after all the $ she gave you in the failed presidential run. Loser.
She bought you out too. We are trying to buy 2 GOP Senate votes.   Let us know who is not in DeVos pockets
Wrong.  @BetsyDeVos is no champion of students and/or parents. I call on the #Senate to decline the nomination. #noDevos
No she is not.  Did you even LISTEN to her confirmation answers?
Are you going increase the #budget to provide adequate tools such as #NewBooks #technology #Science #art @BetsyDeVos @usedgov
too bad Michigan isn't doing as well under DeVos's "assistance"
Thank god u have nothing to do with it.
you are mistaken and wrong if you vote no. But voters can fix that. #soon2018
no she's not. She's the worst thing that could happen to education in this country.
is a champion for turning your kids' education into a for-profit venture & the scamming MLM Amway family @usedgov @GovWalker
How much did @BetsyDeVospay ya for that fill-in-the-blank letter of rec? @usedgov #governersjustlikeus #callyoursenator
Dear Governor Walker, You are probably not going to get re-elected.
The phone calls, the tweets, the faxes will continue...consider yourself on notice!
No!! Please listen to the people, all the teachers & educators are against this conf for a reason.
you have got to be kidding me. She is the worst.
says someone who has worked all his life to destroy public education.
Yeah, the worst thing I want to see is you supporting someone. It's an instant killer for me. 'NO' to DeVos!
of course you would! Did she donate to your campaign also? I guess money can buy everything!
Guns in schools=nuts 
Campus sexual assault stance= DANGEROUS 
Never supported public schools - WHAT???
bullshit. Fuck this aristocrat who knows nothing about education.
Well there goes our education system.. Ahhhhh "Christian Science," with a  splash of animosity towards people of color.
She will help fix education for all
she will stop the bulling for all. This is happening now at #HighlandsElementarySchool
loser, you have no idea what a good leader looks like #VoteNoDevos
so how much did she donate to your campaign?
#wrong @GOP cowards! Selling out to a big donor. You should be ashamed. #terriblenominee
she's not
No, she is the worst thing for public schools. She has no idea what the issues are in schools, no clue.
shame on you! Devos is a disgrace not a champion!
Bachelor of Arts degree? You are very unqualified to be serve in a position you know nothing about.

DeVos leading education would be a mockery.   She's a fool when it comes to education.
I am calling on you to vote no.  The #GOP needs to stand up and not be crony #capitalists.  @GovWalker @GOPHELP @BetsyDeVos @usedgov
ugh, I thought we'd heard the last of you. Go away!!
.@GovWalker @BetsyDeVos @usedgov Betsy is a TOTAL ahole who wants to privatize the public school system so rich men can get richer #jerk 
.@GovWalker What are called "public schools" in many of USA's wealthy communities aren't really "public" at all
Governor Walker, you seem intelligent at times, and woefully ignorant on issues like this.
This is a JOKE.  SHE  IS TOTALLY UNQUALIFIED She couldn't run my class for 1 day. We will not go quietly...
Shame on you. She has zero experience and she is unqualified.
She's a total sham.
You are an incredible disappointment. DeVos has no deep experience in Ed and our children will be worse off
Your statement is not based in facts. She has damaged entire school systems
Walker your just as bad or worse than DeVos, you sold your soul to tea party to get elected, she bought hers
You should be ashamed. @BetsyDeVos is trying to buy this. Children deserve better. #NoDeVos
liar
but bears in schools. Oh my! DeVos is not qualified. Check her resume. She's never been an educator. Sad!
WRONG!  She is unqualified and PAID for your vote!  #Recuseyourself #DumpDevos #Wearewatching
So then we'll vote against you. Because she's a terrible choice.

no scott! she bought that post and Everyone knows it!
I think Michigan strongly disagrees with you on this matter/person
How much did she pay you to tweet this, Gov Walker?, you know she's unqualified. Her hearing was a disaster!
You know you have an issue when even Texans hate you.
If you think DeVos is qualified intellectually or ethically then you should not be Governor of anywhere.
