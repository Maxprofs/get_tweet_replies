neither qualified nor worthy.  I fear for the future of public education!
I need your help in Silver Springs Nv.  Cowboy!
You should be embarrassed and take yourself back to school
If you really want to help education in this country, step down and let someone knowledgeable do the job. You don't have a clue.
she was there just trying to see how she can exploit you.
... and a current special ed teacher, tries to understand your views on education @BetsyDeVos @NDSS https://www.facebook.com/notes/paul-howard/devos-the-future-of-education-in-america-part-1-devoid-of-qualification/1397666200296731 …

I can't wait to see conditions and curriculum improve in my children's schools!
I need help in Silver Springs Nevada.  My 9 yr. old has taken control of his school.  Cowboy!
@realDonaldTrump In an attempt to understand your viewpoints on education...
*learn from* #transitiveVSintransitive
I'm so glad you're learning! Do you know what IDEA is yet? You may want to know how this law affects my disabled child. #autism
You mean "meet with, listen to, learn from..."? Otherwise you meant "listen with, learn with", which for you might makes sense.
do you even know what the Oxford Comma is?
I cannot express how embarrassed and disgusted Michigan is... with you
Dearest Betsy Boo, please read: https://www.facebook.com/notes/paul-howard/devos-the-future-of-education-in-america-part-1-devoid-of-qualification/1397666200296731 …
For a Secretary of Education nominee, your command of English language really sucks. Re-write the first sentence and resubmit, please.
There is no way  you will get that position. Special needs children need protection.  Walk away now. You're done.
What has convinced you that DeVos will not protect #SpecialNeeds #children?
Her track record. Her lack of knowledge of Federal IDEA laws. Her lack of commitment to enforce IDEA laws at a federal level
She has a bad track record w/ #SpecialNeeds #children? Can you reference where you learned this, so that I can take a look?
Have u watched her nomination hearing?That's a good place to start.Why does she have ur support?Genuinely would like 2 know.
She has my support because she's a strong supporter of school vouchers, which I believe are essential 2 improving our edu system.
will b proud to see any evidence of guud werk from u
learn how to use conjugations, please. Run on sentences are not proper English Betsy. . .
// im good..
@WeAreTeachers @peoplefor @NationalPTA Any org that engages you has an agenda that doesn't benefit our children.#Impeach

...meet, listen to, learn from, and engage with
please spend time meeting, listening, learning & engaging with educational leaders!
Meet WITH? Listen TO? Learn FROM? Engage WITH? Learn parallelism, please! Sad. #BetsysWarOnEnglish #FoxGuardingTheHenhouse
thank you, i was about to point this out myself
And what a surprise to learn that bears, which kill 0 students, are more threat than guns, killing 10,000
are they proud of the fact you're not aware that disabilities are covered under federal law?
be friends with me ! the smart people are so few...
Why don't you believe children with #autism deserve an education?

ya blame it on the staff. Buck stops with the person in charge
Did you let them know you'll be dismantling their federally protected special education rights and safeguards?
you are a danger to the US Dept of Education in particular IDEA
you're UNQUALIFIED for the position of education secretary... PERIOD
Step away!!! You are not qualified!!
You do not need a comma before the and.  Do you even know anything about grammar, or did you just spread your legs for Trump?
as a retired educator with 33 years experience I'd love to share my views with you.
http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/ld/resources/writing/grammar/grammar-guides/semicolon …
You might have thought about a colon here since you are giving a list of items.
you don't need the last comma. Where did you go to school?
Me and my son. Please explain rolling back rights under 1975 federal IDEA to state disaster.
You should be embarrassed by your bad grammar
#grammarfail
Talking about a run on sentence 
but no one is proud of the work u do!
More grammatical errors in this tweet as well. Save our kids from #BetsyDevos.
Another mangling of proper English
Did you have paperwork ready for them to sign away their child's rights under law?

your sentence is missing  a few prepositions.  Aren't you in Edumacation or sumfink?
terrible grammar
inauguration or linaugration just asking as English isn't my first language...
:: what's most awesome is you could only listen because they are all smarter than you.  I'd sooner make a Downs kid sec.
No coma after learn! C'mon Betsy!
to meet, to listen and to learn.  split infinitives.  do you know what that is?
photo opps & meeting don't make you more knowledgeable about inclusion in public schools & IDEA. @NDSC @policyupdates rock
Given this, I don't want you running our schools.
I went to a private school through eighth grade and public high school; both were excellent. Clearly yours weren't.
I don't know where you got your private education, but you must have been absent a lot.
Creationist science class and Bible time cut into grammar instruction.

Univ  & teachers poisoning minds & scare tactics,keep up,the chalking,ex KSU Univ Kennesaw Ga speakers David Banner,Angela Davis
don't put a comma before 'and'. Jesus fucking Christ!
You ned to be honorable and step down from cabinet position. you are not qualified. you clearly showed that in hearing.
U r a dummy
This tweet also contains grammatical errors. There goes that staff of yours again. #SMH
Thank you for the update repel common core mom's are suffering !!!!

They'll sure be pissed when you take away the assurance that they'll be supported educationally. Fuck 'em, right Betsy??
We all saw the first tweet.  We learned grammar and proofreading in public school. #unqualified
see any grizzlies?
idiot

hopefully you discussed IDEA and how important it is.
nice to see you have corrected your grammar - ready for Trump's high iQ cabinet now
you are a loser who only cares for the wealthy and not educated on those who want a great education...U R unfit for office
Thanks for getting to work so quickly and meeting with NDSS!
DEVOS you are not fit to serve.  Do the right thing and quit now.
My son benefits from NCLB, do you know what that is?
A law that was replaced by ESSA in December of 2015?
Out of al the unqualified picks, you are the worst. You will destroy the education system single handedly. So sad.
@Italians4Trump @NDSS good luck hang in there
public school
I stand behind you! #SchoolChoice for district 11798 The No Child Left Behind Act has failed us!
NCLB focused on proficiency and was destined to fail. It was replaced in 2015 By ESSA.
You're a perfect Trumper. You're a threat to our country and our children's well-being. I will fight for my babies. Shame on you
Thank you for all you do

: You should never,ever be in charge of our countries Childrens education,you tried to screw our Michigan children up
Lets get drunk again tonight babe
you're "proud" of the work they do but clearly don't actually understand it ok
Clearly trying to make up for the fact that she had no clue what the IDEA laws were during her hearing.
Did you share with them all your knowledge of IDEA? That would have been a quick meeting.
you sure had a lot to learn.
# I'm for you hang strong
Now go home Betsy.  You are not an educator and are unqualified!
rather that blame a system that has vetted teachers as "Highly Qualified" (Texas)
rather *than* blame...

As a teacher I hope your administration restores ideas that stress basic parental responsibility...
Parental responsibility IF it's not common core related. We are the rebellion to the established govt controlled schools.
I am also working for education can we talk?
Good Luck Ms. Devos! @BetsyDeVos @NDSS
hello here is Yousaf from Pakistan
Hope you learned something about the IDEA!
nice Betsy it'd be great of you donated some money to them. You know use money for good instead of evil just for a change
God says Well done my faithful servant. Thank you for fighting for the Parents and our Children. The Left wants reeducate
