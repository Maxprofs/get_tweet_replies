Betsy DeVos will be great Secretary of Education.her passion for every child having a good education is proven by years of work in Michigan
*Her
@mpg25mary @newtgingrich Teachers shd teach subjects objectively & cease with the progressive leftist liberal indoctrination.
crit thinking, open-mindedness, and creativity. The devious liberal indoctrination agenda
Where did it go? Not today's agenda. I saw it erode.
Depends on where you go. Come visit my (public school) classroom!
God bless, because so many students graduating ill-informed w/closed minds. 
there are teachers that should not be teaching but they have had good ones to be fair
We'll be monitoring your activities.
@MichaelRCaputo @newtgingrich "every child"? That includes LGBTQ children also, right?
RED BLUE GREE BLACK YELLOW IF U ARE COLOUR BLIND WOULD IT MATTER CHILDEN R CHILDREN
how does one Judge the mind of A 4 year old.
Not exactly sure how this is an endorsement. Here! Look at my education trail of tears! https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/12/08/a-sobering-look-at-what-betsy-devos-did-to-education-in-michigan-and-what-she-might-do-as-secretary-of-education/?client=safari …
Newty, if you lived in Michigan you'd know how horrible she's been for Michigan schools.
only rich kids will benefit! As usual. The meek will inherit the earth. The greedy will burn 
Michigan is ranked 28th in the nation and 41st in 4th grade reading. All that hard work is really paying off. #smh
Nonsense. She - and u - want to destroy public education. Vouchers for those who don't need them.
what about poor inner city school kids who share books! And are starving? She is clueless.
wait, all the success of the reform of her Michigan schools...#thingsthatmakeyougohmm
, @BetsyDeVos 's passion is for every straight, Christian child to have a great education and for me to pay for it. Not good.
You forgot "white."
Grizzly Lives Matter
the fact that this attrition is to newt gingrich is an immediate discredit. As if being you weren't enough.
But children in Michigan do NOT have great schools. You can't just say this and make it true!
the for profit charter schools in Michigan do not meet the minimum standards of our public schools.
shall have to take the best.
BLACK MONEY BETTY. IMPEACH BANNON!
I don't know her qualifications. Can you list them. Thank you
Newt Gingrich is where the missing gravy went.
She actually has ZERO proof of any sort of applicable experience for this position.
are we talking about Michigan where I was raised? I'm confused about the great things she did.
Honored by Newt Gingrich..that speak volumes. smh.
I have only heard extremely poor results of her schools. U.S. students deserve better!
No, she won't be great. She couldn't even formulate complete sentences w/proper grammar in hearings. CRINGEWORTHY #idiotdevos

How much does a Senate vote cost? You do the math: http://ampr.gs/2jx0ADD   #DumpDeVos #DevosFacts 
Disagreed. She will be worse than the NCLB.
what about children with disabilities?
except schools in Michigan are in shambles. You will not privatize Education!
that's a joke....have u set foot in a public school? Come down to Ga...spend a month in an Atlanta school
I'm sitting @ a school board meeting w/ a teacher from Mich. who strongly disagrees w/ u. Newt! No charter schools
from the man who has cheated on at least two of his 3 wives... yeah family values.
he does not even use capitalization or use periods correctly
he's not necessarily a plausible source of confidence, nobody of substance likes Newt Gingrich
You care about your religious agenda and taking funds away from public schools. Teachers think you are a joke!
LIES LIES LIES.
I hear the people of Detroit are not happy with the education they are receiving in schools today!
Hey Newt, that first sentence needs a space at the end. The second sentence needs a capital letter and a period.
http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/betsy-devos-michigan-school-experiment-232399 …
lies from the pit of hell. Let's get some kids from michigan on the horn shall we
she's literally destroyed school districts in MI, why don't you get in touch with people. Start in Detroit.
Plz ensure specialed teachers get recognition&aid they deserve despite never having  "high achieving" kids like their collegues
If Newt is complimenting you, it is the kiss of doom.  You are not qualified, and should step aside.
unfortunately that is not true. One who knows not of struggle or poverty should not be in charge of education
never
Newt will say anything for a buck. Anything.
the only thing she knows about he inner city is to roll the windows up when she drives through it.. She is a joke.
her years in Michigan trying to gut public schools? Yea I bet she'll be perfect
How much have you donated to him?  How much did each kind word cost you?
wait did you watch a different hearing?  As uninformed as Dump.  Quite literally the blind leading the blind
You do realize that being praised by Newt Gingrich is no honor, right?
being honored by @newtgingrich is not an honor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMRX_21Le6I … and this proves the opposite, just like Trump she could not even do her homework!
#freecollege
Hmmm... A man who cheated on 3 wives? Sad what the REP party has become. We are all depressed. Get real please.



...can I get a hit of that weed u have been smoking Newt
Agree. Wyoming school does need protection from grizzlies. Some Alaska schools need polar bear protection.
Really? This shows Newts lack of care and compassion for our nations children. Shame on both of you!
As for funding shift, Public/Charter:  the USA went from peacetime to wartime within days of Dec 7th. Houses burn down. "STUFF" happens.
Whitehouse: if transition to charter happens, would happen seamlessly as PubSchl teachers get "reeducated" to work charter, maybe same bldg.
Not like teachers for charter spring up from ground. Seen too many times when PubSchls rearrange chairs on "Titanic" when new Capt needed.
If Detroit Charter schools failing: ALL about FATHERS! Moms need more "birth-PreK" time. No one teaches child like mom! U Can't fake nature.
Detroit? Other cities? Get jobs/fathers back for/in families. Teach families how to help own children. Success begins with family.
Wish you'd asked Sen Sanders: "And if Mrs. Clinton had not been the wife of former president, would she have become a senator or SecState?"
Good answer on Pre-K. Wife was K/1-3 teacher. Parents not reading. Inner city worst of all.  Of all money spent in education, pre-K good.
Wish you had said "No, but ..." to Sen Murray re: "cut single penny to public schloos" NOT going to get Murray's vote. No need to Play Nice.
Would have said:  "But Senator Murray what I WILL do is insist every penny be directed to greatest extent directly to students, not unions."
Sen Enzi asks: rural/frontier? I was on-line tchr. Good start. Let HOMESCHOOL funds follow child. Create industrial mentor pay for HS.
NO to paying off college loans. We paid son's univ. Anyone chooses dumb major deserves debt. Bought burrito from UNCG grad w/PSYCH degree.
Stop saying "kids" past grade 5. Audie Murphy: 16 when first tried to enlist, enlisted @ 17.  Commissioned, awarded CMH for actions age 19.
Yes all students are unique/as are teachers. Please (re)read "Cultural Literacy" (Hirsch). Some things students just NEED to KNOW!
Give me a job in Dept of Ed!
Our most prominently rising demographic is Hispanics when only "Mexicans" can DO anything.  (I'm bilingual by choice; tutor ES)
Tell some young professional that SHOP classes were BS when the AC goes out. Gone are days when most men work on their own cars.
No one pays adults to take standardized tests. SHOP provides relevance for math, history of ALL technologies. Standard education = BORING!
"Education without experience is dangerous.  Experience without education is unfinished business," Capt Moses Hirshkowitz, USMS (USMMA)
Friends who homeschool have better adjusted youngsters.  Enlist @mikeroweworks to find work for HS grads. "College" can follow.
and tastier too! Right @yumbrands #MAGA #NeverMetAWeirdoKidWhoWasHomeschooled
16 year SHOP teacher. Quit @ 54. Let $ follow student thru tech schl/univ, to HSA. If parents can guide college choice they can guide K-12.
She'll protect kids against grizzlies, but not guns.  Do the math.   #STOPYOURLYING
When you didn't prepare for your senate hearings, you said, it's money not learning that counts. #BetsyDeVos
Why didn't you care enough about education to at least prepare for your own senate hearing?
She destroyed Michigan's schools. Look at the data for Gods sake

I guess only some kids/schools matter. Nice job in Michigan #sad #notqualified

Here's how I felt after Betsy DeVos Senate appearance today. #NeedGunsinSchoolsforGrizzlies
easy to say when daddy sends you to the best private schools money can buy.
where her results are horrible.
newt there isn't one public school teacher in Michigan who wants any Devos running our schools.
this woman represents the worst of American Education. Vouchers take MY tax dollars out of my community. Thief!
Wrong Bewt.She has zero tolerance,  zero knowledge and is a puppet for Christian Dogma.
you're both gross...GO AWAY!!!!!
yes, because newt is such an upstanding guy
, you understand he didn't even CAPITALIZE THE START OF A SENTENCE.
Not if herfamily gave$10million 2LGBT conversiontherapy. I'm notgay but this is frightening if shebelieves in this
We need real caring, conservative teachers for our children's impressionable, beautiful minds! 
#Jan20 #MAGA
I'm just sorry, Ms. DeVos, that you're having to suffer so many commie fools today. Disgraceful.
Of course you would thank Newt. You are trolls who live under the same bridge.
ugh YOU FUNDED Globalist AGENDA! Devos TEACH mideast #BetsyDeVos @realDonaldTrump
I agree she is a terrible pick. Sister of Blackwater, privatization=corps after ED$$
Newt, he's admirable. 3 marriages, lies, egotist. U thank him, I and most wd tell him to go away
she'll destory what's left of public education since she knows nothing abt it. Vouchers? 4 the rich? Puke.
passion for every child-who come from wealth&privilege. Could never ID w/ working class or ppl from poverty. Sad!

Hmm, described as a dismal educational landscape...https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/12/08/a-sobering-look-at-what-betsy-devos-did-to-education-in-michigan-and-what-she-might-do-as-secretary-of-education/?client=safari …
Betsy DeVos, Trump’s Education Pick, Plays Hardball With Her Wealth https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/us/politics/betsy-devos-education-secretary.html?smid=fb-share …
we will continue to fight for proper confirmations #TheResistance
@Mike_Beacham @newtgingrich NO, We The People are honored. Thank you for accepting!
not qualified- step away from this nomination
Honored by Newt? It is like saying... I really don't know what to write...Oh, my... Newt? Education? Special?
So sad - this is one of the reasons you have no standing with the American People
THE problem with education
Proven out to underperform when compared to public schools. Pls show me how I'm wrong about that. Show me the #'s
you are a threat to our public school system.
Has Betsy spent even one day teaching in a public school in inner-city Detroit?
How r u qualified for the job hving never attended public school or sent ur children to 1?
how long has she taught. Has she talked to teachers about needs. Teachers are amazing but cc is NOT the problem
#unqualified
.@BetsyDeVos @Mike_Beacham @newtgingrich DONT MAKE IT ANY WORSE THAN IT ALREADY S #PS LIFT ALL THE FEDERAL #COERSION RETURN ED TO THE STATES
please clarify?: where are you on separation of church and state?
yes Betsy.  Your college's namesake was all FOR separation of church and state AND public schools
yeah because she paid for her position. You don't know a damn thing about public education
This from the man who wanted city school kids to clean their own bathrooms. #leastqualifiednominee
So sad you chose to join the Trump administration....what a disgrace!
Listng to the young grads who say Civil War was in 18th Cent and R Lee fought with Washington - Uck.
And yet, children in Detroit schools are learning in squalor. How is that support for education?
Horrible selection. A disgrace to teachers.
every anti common core organization in Michigan hates #BetsyDevos
if Newt backs that's enough for me. I'm gonna have to oppose anyone he endorses. He thinks feelings = facts.
unqualified
@realDonaldTrump @newtgingrich this is the biggest joke. You have no qualifications but either does Trump
https://newrepublic.com/article/98097/newt-gingrich-scandal-hypocrisy …
Completely unqualified for this job, even less than her hubby was for Governor. #Newtisatwat #publiceducation
@SebGorka @newtgingrich #MAGA
let's have real school choice with no strings attached
@EvelynGarone @newtgingrich I'm hopeful there will be some real change in our school system-our kids deserve a quality education
please don't forget our children in the special education system !
billions in charter school frAud in MI because of DEVOS lobbying efforts of no charter accountability.She's a scam

Michigan where failing charter schools abound!
.@BetsyDeVos @newtgingrich The DeVos family are not a friend of public schools in MI and they will destroy it nation wide #getyourfactsright
Yes her years of work destroyed Detroits public schools, created a charter school system of unregulated businesses
WE MUST STAND UP TOGETHER AGAINST COMMON CORE!
@HouseCracka @newtgingrich Get rid of Common Core.
@realDonaldTrump Dear Ms. DeVos, will you help to change this Politically Correct/Narcissistic/Liberal Education?
being honored by a @newtgingrich endorsement is an automatic disqualification.
Common Core must go. @newtgingrich
Any endorsement from Gingrich is proof of corruption and a red light to not trust DeVos.

@ProudTexanGal @newtgingrich Proud of Michigander Devos, great choice.  Be ready for Liberal false narrative attacks.
what's the over/under that it's Russia or Racism?
@robfoerster @newtgingrich Where and when was Betsy a teacher? What grade level(s)?
Betsy is the enemy of children having a great education in MI!  Appointment biggest disappointment of the year.
agree http://www.newswithviews.com/Hoge/anita134.htm …

http://www.newswithviews.com/Kepus/diane147.htm … 
http://www.newswithviews.com/Kepus/diane160.htm …  bad for homeschoolers
Its a very big and necessary job as it gives young people hope for their future Hope all goes well
I hope you get rid of common core.
Oh to receive the praise of Newtie! I am jealous!
The best! Helping to drain the swamp!
I loved reading of your passion for children's education, but have you ever been a teacher?
@patriotzcb @BetsyDeVos  Thanks to you and your family for your service to our country.
PTSD is very real. I hope everyone with PTSD and all service-related illness gets the help & support they deserve.
Saluting kudos is political theater. Hard work against strong headwinds is ahead. God's speed.
@Mike_Beacham @newtgingrich
@realDonaldTrump @MKkarstwalker Voters are watching this - no compromise on common core. Centralizaton of education - communism
@ChooseToBFree @newtgingrich I hope you can get our children back on track for all the high paying jobs Mr. Trump will bring
No common core - this is not a bargain point. If you in any way support centralization of education - failure
@MKkarstwalker We are watching you Betsy. Because centralization equals propaganda - so no common core
NO COMMON CORE !!
@realDonaldTrump STOP indoctrination and return to education!
Reports coming in from Michigan teachers and parents: Worst news for kids and teachers ever. Harmful policies.
