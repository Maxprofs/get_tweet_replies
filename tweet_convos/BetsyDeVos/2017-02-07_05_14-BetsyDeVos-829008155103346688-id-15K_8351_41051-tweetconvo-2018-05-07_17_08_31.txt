1) Turns out, Canada is actually considered the most educated country in the entire world.
@BetsyDeVos I voted for you but never thought you would slap public education and its dedicated teachers in the face like this!
Hillary Clinton presented a detailed plan for how to improve the U.S. education sector, but you wanted Betsy DeVos.
I really voted against HC.  0 respect for her.
...and in hindsight, not your best call? Anyhow, enjoy Betsy Devos' political oversight of your profession for the next 4 yrs.
I would vote against her again if given that choice
Teach me, teacher: fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on...
Twitter must be paying a lot of over time with all negative tweets pushed to the top and positive tweets shadow banned or pushed down
I cant wait to see what she does with the corrupt teachers unions :-).
you have to release the states from the #corestandards or there is no #choice #stopfeded
Betsy Devos is the best thing that has happened to education is decades. She put children before union and politics. Great choice.
She sucks, just like you. It won't be long now before you are all a distant, distasteful memory in the history of our already great country.
@VP @abc13houston @KPRC2  THIS IS HOW YOU ACHIEVE DESPITE HAVING FAILED GOVERNMENT LEADERSHIP FROM THE PRESIDENT DOWN TO SECY OF EDUCATION. Third Ward teen offered full ride to 20 universities, including four Ivy Leagues http://www.khou.com/article/news/third-ward-teen-offered-full-ride-to-20-universities-including-four-ivy-leagues/285-533417660 … via @KHOU
True reform would be to get the Federal Gov out of the business of education and let the he states take care of that. Betsy is a conservative and she should get rid of liberals and leftists in the department of ed. That would be a good start. Liberalism is a disease!


She doesn't know her ass from her elbow (among other things).
your wrong. She is a very smart person. And she will fix our schools
would you hire her to be in charge of what and how your kids were taught? I'm glad my kids are out of school.
many parents are against her. Pick someone more qualified and not a huge republican donor. Public education needs our support.
you need to go back 2 school & learn new words, Great, Beautiful, Fake, Bad, etc r not the words that should b used in EVERY sentence
why believe anything you say about education? Your staff cannot even spell simple words. #NoDeVos
the best thing about Betsy she is  not a product of our failed education system - it needs new blood - go Betsy!
this is a terrible Choice.
Why ?
Yes
she won't win.
We don't need no Edukasion!
Cough*bull-hockey*cough.

WE WANT THE LOCAL LEVEL RESPONSIBILITY BACK.   DELETE FED DEPT OF ED!!!!!!!!
agreed
.@POTUS Betsy DeVos is a billionaire living in a COMPOUND. Her and her kids went to PRIVATE school. Has ZERO experience in education sector.
it doesn't seem like she learnt much in school and neither did Trump..
@Scavino45 Dem steal from the ssystem they care about is their $ amount that they can steal from system used kids for their profits
She is a disgrace to public education and those of us that work in public education.  She has no clue and is highly unqualified!
she is HIGHLY unqualified for the job.
She's a talentless hack who's only in the seat because she's donated millions. Keep our money in public schools!
this statement proves that you have never met with a 3rd grade teacher #DumpDevos
Trump University FAILED! You know so much about education clearly. Get someone qualified for the job.
thanks daddy
Nope! She's the worst.
@realDonaldTrump Stand with our president @realDonaldTrump #PrayForTrump #GodBlessAmerica
of course you and @senrobportman aren't bothered that she owes Ohio $5.3 million in fines,

open your eyes

you support a killer too?
send your kid to public school. Then I'll listen to your opinion.
no president in recent history has sent their kids to a public school.
no kiddin?
obama, bush, Clinton, all elite private schools
no shit. What to you think of DeVos?  She's in. A union busting charter school advocate. What do you think, as a teacher?
don't like her, but free choice is already in Ohio so it should hurt us like some states. Ohio has open enrollment
and isn't wanting to pump federal dollars into charter schools and open enrollment two different things?
state already pump money into charter schools.
we need to invest in public schools not eliminate them
California is ranked 40th and has one of the highest per child cost compared to other states. Yea I think we need a change
Cali is 29th w/ cost of living adj. but there will always be a 29th in a union of 50 states- is public ed good or bad?
cost of living would be much lower though if we didn't have libs running the state into the ground.
property prices (population) are driving primary cost of living; make rent and you can handle pretty much all else
This causes an artificial shortage of rental properties which combined with increase in pop causes rent to go sky high. 1/2
when have you sent your child to public school?  You know nothing, DeVos knows nothing about public schools.

NO WAY! Your kid goes to an expensive private school, so good for you - but what about the rest of us?! @POTUS #NOTODEVOS
But her reforms have failed even more spectacularly & her dogmatic & ignorant crusade can only serve to enrich investors.
Your Executive Orders suck.
Democrats are more concerned with their cash cow,  "teachers union" than with our children or teachers.
none of the replies are about money, but i guess
another Dem sit in
says the people who can't take approval ratings and negative articles...
You got me there...#FakePolls #FakeNews #Propaganda does in fact bother me. Sue me...
But Fox doesn't?
Yes, some of Fox is #FakeNews also...
journalism is straight reporting w/o putting opinion into questions answers to lead Amer astray
.@POTUS #NoJebEd #RepublicanParentsAgainstDevos #StopDataMiningOurKids4Profit
THIS Republican woman and #homeschool mom says #confirmBetsyDeVos & stand for choice for every child!
.@CindyGravesFL @POTUS WE need Jeb & Betsy to #StopDataMiningOurKids4Profit #PrivacyMatters #ConflictOfInterestsMatter #MyKidsDataIsNOT4Sale
Education is bad. Let's make it worse!
@BetsyDeVos is a complete moron! The only reason why she got the position is because she is a rich white billionaire  and donated 9.5 million dollars to Trump’s campaign.
This is one of his best jokes on the United States Of AMERICA. She’s so unqualified it’s almost funny.
“LOL! That’s a good one!!!!!”

President Trump, you pick a Winner with Betsy!  How Fast did Runcie Run when is Corruption was Discovered?  RUN RUNCIE RUN!!!!
No Donald Trump Betty DeVos is a dominionist
As are a great deal of your staff
Wake the hell up
They have no time for democracy or diversity
2). The literacy rate is over 99%, and over half of all Canadian’s have college degrees –

3) it might have something to do with the way Canada’s education system works!
she lacks qualifications just as a teacher wouldn't serve the AMA well, either.
@LisaLoni14
Rich white Democrats snd their kids to private schools & want to keep black kids out. Why don't blacks see it? Repubs do.
some do but they don't expect taxpayers to foot the bill.
Taxpayers are "footing the bill" for failed public schools. Let the parents pick the school for the same $$.
but what about secular schools should my tax $ support them?
Parents who want parochial shld be able to pick that. Those who want "progressive" indoctrination pick that.
they can choose. Just not with MY tax dollars.
They can with mine. And their own. And yours.

And women can't choose to kill their unborn babies with mine.
your tax dollars do not fund abortion see Hyde Amendment.
@BetsyDeVos no she is not. You're a great fool!
DeVos knows nothing about public schools. Very poor choice
f them Go Trump
you are delusional..there's a diagnosis for this
Mr Trump...you got my vote but I don't agree with this appointment. If Vouchers come, public school is destroyed
no! She's the absolute worst! Just like you! You're a puppet being controlled by Bannon and GOP!
I want to see your taxes. What are you hiding?
@BetsyDeVos Shit,she don't know where pencils r.  Walmart or teachers own money is the answer.  She spent 200m ( ur math)buying job.
I sure hope so
u are delusional...#NotmyPresident
The confirmation of @BetsyDeVos is an insult to my wife, her profession, her two master's degrees, and the poor salary she's received
perhaps if you have a child in private and or parochial school and need the tax write off! Duh
satire, right?
Not support. Bad! Awful.
@BetsyDeVos donnie either you took too many meds or not enough. Smh. She's a choice.
@BetsyDeVos @AndreasOpinions @LisaBornfree247 she bought the position with her donations 2 senators! My tax $$ 4 public schools only!
Not YOUR kid or gkid. Other people are rats in her experiment. Surely she could have contributed w/o a cabinet position.
you've done this country's education system a great disservice.
@BetsyDeVos My children attended charter schools and my grandchildren will also! Congratulations the public ed needs reform
Betsy bought her appointment and you both know it. You are a liar and a fool.
#delusional
@BetsyDeVos, no need to retweet praise from those you have paid off. We get it. No need to drive it in any further. Please resign.
she paid you to say that! DA
seriously?  Well at least put home economics and woodshop back in the shit schools so we can build yur house & cook yur food
@BetsyDeVos Educators around the country feel betrayed, to say the least. You're all a disgrace to this country.
you suck!
@BetsyDeVos Trump..would have been nice if you picked someone that had experience..guess I have to homeschool my kid now.
You do know that reformers are supposed to improve things, right?  Cuz.. that's the opposite of what we're gonna see here. Just sayin
she is a science denier that wants to privatize education. This isn't good for our children .
@BetsyDeVos  So she's a reformer, reform the public school system? Sending kids away from public schools is NOT reform.
@BetsyDeVos.   How does it feel to be the most HATED 2 people in the world?
she paid to play so why did you nominate someone the same way you claim Obama would have?
yeah right!
I do not agree
@BetsyDeVos if only she knew what she was doing
please stop taking judiciary personally.  Leave it to your AG.  I support you and our checks and balances.
@BetsyDeVos No, no she is not. #downwithbetsy
No sir, she won't be.  Just as you are not, nor ever will be.
Great for the rich white kids...
how can she do a great job when she didn't even know the difference between proficiency and growth
A big shot like you?.. C'mon, is so obvious she bought her way into the position - you've been bought Donald Chump and people see it
Thank you for another excellent choice for your cabinet.  Continuing to do the same thing is stupid and/or insane. God bless you.
@BetsyDeVos sure thing - it will be a freaking wreck by the time she veers
Great for YOUR kids maybe. Our kids just got a C- leader. Unqualified. Sad.
@BetsyDeVos You mean literally your kids. Rich kids only.
@BetsyDeVos what the fuck ever..just like you are going to bring the country together!
only if they believe in God else their ass is grass
Excellent choice for Education reform
only as long as you're white privileged with money
I'm one pissed off 911 family member "You are not my president" hear me well.

@BetsyDeVos  Defund politically biased Districts/schools-Minors should not be allowed to leave class to protest. #parentalrights
liar
@BetsyDeVos BALONEY!!!  Filling the swamp.
@BetsyDeVos both idiots. Not very good. Bigly disappointed. This is going to be Yuuuuge mistake.
Basic requirement for a reformer is knowledge  of that which is to be reformed. The @usedgov has been bought.
Another 1%er that bought thier way in.
#DeVos record in Detroit has been a failure.
haha Dem don't want status quo just don't want u2 making it worse
except your kid who will go to private school. PAY FOR PLAY SCHEME at the WH. Sad day in American Educational system.
she will be absolute HORRIBLE for our kids-you, like always, do not know what you are talking about!!
@BetsyDeVos We shall soon see.
@BetsyDeVos not your kids Donald!!!
You have no idea what you're talking about. Maybe you should BOTH go back to school. Learn how to spell and speak.
stop deleting my tweets 2
Yes
@BetsyDeVos she is a highly unqualified person! Get her out! #BetsyDeVos #foreverychild #Resist #TheResistance
hope She can bring the BIBLE back into the schools.
Devos is unqualified ... Just like you
@BetsyDeVos Haven't heard how that will happen (other than the socialist public money for private tuition idea). Details!
De Vos like The lying president doesn't know what to do with education
@BetsyDeVos good thing neither of you understand the public school system....wow our children will be so successful #SARCASM
@LindaSuhler We have NO Education because of the NEA. If she gets rid of them, maybe she can start over with Education in the US
@BetsyDeVos can't effectively reform anything she doesn't understand. Her hearing was an abysmal failure. SAD!
Oh really so your kids are in public schools?

liar, she is like you, a billionaire opportunist.
BDV is a total idiot-the rest belong in a mental hospital
@BetsyDeVos no. She's going to be a royal pain in the butt, just like you!!!
you're so out of touch with real people.
boooo!!!
Devos is as unqualified as you are. Neither of you could run a damn lemonade stand, and yet here you are, in charge of important shit
Drain the swamp to replace with sewage... you duped America!
"our kids?"  No one in your family has or will see the inside of a public school, ever #morelies #thankstrump
The day public education died.  #FakePresident #PutinPuppet
@BetsyDeVos she's already demonstrated that with her zero qualifications. Wait no
@GOP she does not care about my son education she only care about her kids and private school I can't afford private school
@BetsyDeVos It's time to grow up and do something for the majority of Americans (even though the majority didn't vote for you)
@BetsyDeVos huge difference between access to and providing a great education. I'll wait and see... USA depends on it.
@BetsyDeVos She is a joke.  Face up to it.
I am a public school teacher In favor of reform who opposed DeVos because she is highly unqualified for the  position!
as a teacher I'm very concerned about her being in charge of public education with the lack of experience she has.
sorry but No!!!!
.@POTUS why can she be completely unqualified to be sec of ed yet I need a masters & years of exp. to be an 8th gr teacher? #DeVosvote
she has never work in the education field but you make her Sec of Education with no playoff experience wow. This administration sucks
pay to play..the trumpy way
@BetsyDeVos Epic Fail Trump
By "our" you mean affluent people's kids.  Public ed is what MADE America great.
