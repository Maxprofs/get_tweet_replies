.@BetsyDeVos has been a champion of education reform for decades and is a fantastic choice to lead the Department of Education.
Embarrassing for both of you

Here's how I felt after Betsy DeVos Senate appearance today. #NeedGunsinSchoolsforGrizzlies
You aren't qualified to run our educational system  to turn them into for profit schemes for corporations you own.
As a resident of the state he left in shambles, I say, "Please, stop - both of you. Our children deserve better."
Eliminating public education is hardly something a "champion of education reform" would actually do.
So sad the people you are aligning with.
oh yes, and the kids can all shoot themselves with the guns she provides
LOL just where is LA ranked in education Mr Jindal- LOL your opinion is superfluous! LOSER
sand so does the absolute nuttiest of the nutballs
*Baci*. Hi @BetsyDeVos @BobbyJindal. Congrats on your nomination. In case you get it, pls consider facts. Thx
, I'll ask @BetsyDeVos to place Noah on the timescale, last 6000 years. Creationists in practice are anthropology deniers as well.
!!!
*Baci* Thanks for hosting @BetsyDeVos & @BobbyJindal. Summary 1] Schools may teach creationism within the context of anthropology.
Social and cultural studies regarding various creation stories should be understood as blind faith.
Therefore, blind faith and superstitious beliefs can not be considered as a valid foundation of policies.
, no problem for @BetsyDeVos @BobbyJindal @LatinaOrgullo @SeanHannity @LeahR7 & @AJDelgado13, just have a JC-like heart filled with

How much does a Senate vote cost? You do the math: http://ampr.gs/2jx0ADD   #DumpDeVos #DevosFacts

Will you ban teaching of evolution in schools? Time to end this farce. It's not science. It's like alchemy only makes less sense
Where in the 10th Amendment does it describe the #DOE ??
#tcot
A champion for wealthy kids & willing to leave poor children behind. Jindal is a verified creep.
#1 education priority: teach people that most MLMs are scams, such as Amway and $HLF/Herbalife.
education reform isn't the answer.  Focus on communities in need and public schools will succeed.
Let's not forget the learning disabled. Parents fight for scraps IEP's NOT implemented! Never ending Exhaustion
For parents

Betsy's husband Dick's parents' foundation "donated $500,000 to NOM an anti-gay marriage organization
why would Bobby Jindals opinion matter?  He did bankrupt Louisiana.  Charter schools are bad for inner cities.
