On the nomination of Betsy DeVos to be Secretary of Education 
no child left behind is a failure. Take it from a teacher who is constantly reminded of the failing system
great pic... we can trust!
Wondering if DeVos was a pay to play person since she has no educational backing
absolutely!! Betsy is the cow that keeps on giving false hopes.
is it time for you to both leave office yet? Literally counting down the days
Her nomination is a travesty. U. S. have become a third world country.
I disagree. DeVos is dedicated to the destruction of public schools.
of course he supports your you paid him enough money...he is going to vote yes on you because of money
yes she paid her way in

a millionaire cannot ever understand low income families, students and their issues
... she has no concept of how to put together a lesson plan to accommodate public school population.
a friend said to me-"How could a billionaire know what it is like to be a poor young person from a poor community"
it's obvious to all of us living in reality and truth. P
the overwhelming response from his constituents was a firm NO on you. You can't stay if you can't listen.
He sold out to big money and ignored his own voters Republican parents. We will recall this.
Alexander you sold your soul to the devil


Betsy DeVos :never a teacher,never a BOE member,never attendedPublicSchools,her kids never attended PublicSchools
Never, Never, Never should be DeVos last name.
I need to know your thoughts regarding public school longevity and any affiliation to foreign funded charter schools.
to ask for her thoughts, you may be waiting awhile...

a very sad day that was to swallow.
@SenateDems @womensmarch How much did that vote cost DeVos? What company r u NOT divesting in? #No2Unethical

How much does a Senate vote cost? You do the math: http://ampr.gs/2jx0ADD   #DumpDeVos #DevosFacts 
Zero ideas presented, zero substance offered. We see right through you.
...for affirmation watch her interviews ...deer headlights, mumbles, smiles with tail between legs.

both of you should be ashamed
You deserve it Betsy. Be BRAVE always, keep true faith & NEVER ever no matter what  be cowered by lgbt reprobates.
thanks ignorant!
How many endorsements do you have from actual educators Ms. DeVos? 
Any?

you need to learn to listen to your people and your teachers you might do a little better at your job y
Lamar is an asshat & he doesn't understand the challenges of education.
This is a recipe to continue dumbing-down the fly-over states.

How much did that vote cost you?
danger to our education system. Betsy looked like a fool in the hearings & Alexander puts party over Country

YOU think it's OK you approve someone so UNQUALIFIED? The answer is NO! Vote for the children, not for the MONEY!
You should go back and view your hearing. I think you'd agree, you look completely unqualified. #noconfidence
@JoyAnnReid @frangeladuo @karenhunter @SMShow ah tale you what: betcha Jesus wouldn't cunfermer!

@JoyAnnReid @MSignorile BD & LA r y the south is viewed as dumb! This woman has zero qual 4 the ta$k at hand!
You are the least informed cabinet nominee in my lifetime.  You're going to embarrass yourself and harm children in the process.
I think u did Great answering Sen. Warren's questions! Its obvious she is on a mission to block any good this new Admin. Will do



no experience in public ed & ed work she has done is centered to undermine & privatize public schools
You are wolf in sheep's clothing.  A disaster for children.  Learn the laws!
A disgraceful representative of women. You're lack of knowledge at hearings was an embarrassment.

Privatize schools? How's that working for prison's???
Yr answers were atrocious & troubling. Showed yr ignorance. Can't support Title IX? Guns in schools??talk 2 Newton
So, Alexander, are you on her payroll and another Swamp Dweller for the GOP Suckers?

#DeVos, who still owes >$5 million in election violations, still hasn't completed #DeVosHearing paperwork. #StopDeVos #phled
How much did you pay him for that?
Kids killed by grizzlies: 0.   Kids killed by guns. 10,000.   GET A CLUE   #STOPYOURLYING
you crushed it!! Strung together some damn near sentences!!
do you know federal laws are there for kids w disabilities for a reason.? omg the tweets.
you need to decline,have no clue and embarrassed yourself,the Repub Party and president elect @realDonaldTrump
I'm looking forward to the change in our education system
Yet another Emperor Without Clothes episode. Unqualified, unethical, poorly informed. #releaseyourtaxes #unPOTUS
Here's how I felt after Betsy DeVos Senate appearance today. #NeedGunsinSchoolsforGrizzlies
.
STOP and GO AWAY!  You only have your pocketbook in mind and not the kids minds!
Some performance today.
and how much did you fund his campaign. Hmmm. #swamp
Great choice.   Guns to keep the grizzlies away. No idea about IDEA. Should have done your homework.
can you explain why you donated the maximum amount of money to 5 members of the nomination panel?
Betsy #DeFraud It should be no surprise U would work for @realDonaldTrump to both line your own pockets @SenWarren
hope you fail dismally in your confirmation hearing. Vouchers are total BS. Next you'll want charter schools.
globalist stooge advocate of Common core endorses?
If Alexander is what you think is  complimentary, you are wrong. What a horrible representative for Education.
exactly, globalist est insider. Privatization is corps wanting2get their hands on all that money no better than NEA
sad..just sad..
American families deserve answers! Allow more questions what are you afraid of?#whatuhiding #devoshearings #truth
You did a fantastic job today
I pray rural communities across US will combine efforts public and private to #helpourkids 
she is against disabled children getting equal education, she is against public school funding. #UnAmerican
what are your qualifications to be the secretary of education for America?
If you want to bring Jesus into the classroom, start a parochial school and keep your hands off public education.
.@BetsyDeVos @SenAlexander NO CONFIDENCE!... Voucher-based schools do not outperform public schools! No public money for private schools!!
#wrongsideofhistory
Good luck today
The policies you helped enact led to atrocious conditions in Detroit. What do you tell those parents and kids?
interesting that there is no mention of privatizing our public schools.
no vote of confidence for me go back to Grand Rapids
when will common core go away abd how do we reteach the basics to an 8 grader ? The math is horrible

/Omridick:  Betsy DeVos is restoring confidence to the Dept. of Education.  Change and innovation is coming.
Congrats, Betsy DeVos  on your appointment as an educational leader.
Maybe you can just bring in Neurocore to prevent Alzheimer's and cure ADHD as the "scientific" based ads say on the website. Stealing money.
State visitors going in classrooms daily to interrupt lessons and harrassment of teachers causing a nationwide teacher shortage!
She must get the Marxists out of education https://youtu.be/vLqHv0xgOlc 
Vote of support? Hell no! Kids are human capital to Betsy! Do your homework and look at Michigan.  Shame on Betsy!
#unqualified
Remember what the people want for their children in Education NO COMMON CORE!  We want limited Fed. Gov't as well!
sadly won't get it from her
You are right, she is a bad choice for DOE....most definitely.
really sad, I wish DT stuck2promise to shut down DOE. oligarch/est patting DeVos on the back sickng
Hopfully he will figure out what she is for and turn Education back over to the States.
America does not share this confidence. Charter schools are a disaster for education.
the American people are against you

waiting to hear your stance on the last bastion of democracy. Public education @LIOptOut @NYSAPE @marla_kilfoyle
How much did it cost you to buy this cabinet position? Just wondering.
Bringing prejudice and hate into every school, a bully:
Just end common core!
after reading your critics responses, I see you DO have what it takes to do the job! You're everything they are not!
#Dominionist @realDonaldTrump choice. You're a danger to #publiceducation and #Constitution by brainwashing kids to serve Jesus
Exactly, Cliff. Seperation of Church & State. Religion is bs in school if its only Christians.
All the corrupt RINOs r jumping on board They must support pro Muslim curriculum like Betsy #SOS @SenatorSessions
that's true part of globalist cabal/indoctrination. Privatization=corps want ED$
We are putting out brainwashed 7th graders out of High School right now.I want DOE gone
totally agree. NEA founded/funded by oligarchs to indoctrinate youth to accept NWO/NAU/one world gov. It's worked
I hope it remains a High Priority to wreck what DOE is.
.@BetsyDeVos @SenAlexander Shut down the DoE!!  It's unconstitutional!
BETSY WE HAVE BEEN PART OF AMWAY BUSINESS FOR YEARS GLAD TO SEE TRUMP CHOSE YOU TO DRAIN THE SWAMP OF THE NEA!!
You have never attended public school nor have your kids and you have never worked in public school.   qualified?
Will she bring the full force of the DoE down on Texas for openly defying IDEA if not she is no friend to all kids
hmm. Can I please see evidence of your support for education? Public education.
She's not qualified!
She's for corporate control of Ed no better than NEA. privatization cuz corps wnt those$
Bully and Torture of kids of other faiths, gays, losers, freaks, Freedom of religion means the right to persecute
Wherever you hear the screams of children being bullied by Bible Belt Kids,expressing their religious freedom thru

Betsy congratulations on your appointment, 
I would like to ask, if you will do away with the ungodly teaching..
@realDonaldTrump @transition2017 #NeverTrump Alexander is proof we are right! #DumpDeVos   #LyinTrump
Congratulations Madam Secretary!  No more common core!!!! Yes!!!!!
This is what we get when billionaires contribute to political campaigns: Democracy bought and sold. Shameful.

It's incredible that it's noteworthy when the oligarchs who fund politicians admit the obvious: that they expect - & get - things in return: https://twitter.com/tnewmstweet/status/801497644971524099 …

I'm looking for a Betsy DeVos reading list and welcome suggestions ...
@SebGorka @SenAlexander      If Common Core is one of your favorites I don't think you're qualified
is your hubby going to give up his charter school then?
@SebGorka @SenAlexander I really hope she's against Common Core.
She is.
I DONT EVEN TRUST YOU ! Cruz supporters & you wife worked for him ! @StephenBannon STOP THE RINOS  @BetsyDeVos @GenFlynn
