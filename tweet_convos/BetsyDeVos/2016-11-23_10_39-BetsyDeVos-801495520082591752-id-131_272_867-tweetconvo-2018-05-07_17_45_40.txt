I understand why now.  You can't speak extemporaneously.
NOT GOOD FOR OUR CHILDREN!!!!!
.@BetsyDeVos NO experience in any aspect of pub sch.  Not a public school parent, former attendee, nor teacher. SAD. @transition2017
Can't be any worse  than some career politician #TrustTrump #PresidentTrump #MAGA
She is a career politician. Head of GOP Michigan. Husband ran for Gov and lost. She's a lobbyist. @scottyaloha @BetsyDeVos @transition2017
Ok. I meant career educator but either one is probably not the best
A billionaire essentially buys position of power through campaign contributions. Not surprised, just disgusted.
what is your alternative to common core? It helps to know what your positions are before people can support u.
#1 education priority: teach people that most MLMs are scams, such as Amway and $HLF/Herbalife.
do you plan on meeting with teachers to get insight from them since they are the ones who have to teach the current standards?


TY Ms DeVos @cspanwj "@BetsyDeVos Greatly appreciate all the support & interest. At this time, all comments are deferred to @transition2017
don't let these folks get you down, the media is stirring up the left & right against u, by telling lies. I support you.
You did such a terrible job with Detroit schools, I guess you felt you deserved a promotion?
how does she sleep at night. Betsy not so qualified to exist.

A heads up  http://www.voicesempower.com/trump-devos-national-security-and-the-tarbiyah-project/ …  Facebook posts are claiming you  push Islam and globalism
End standardized testing. Focus on school environment. Possibly even parent/family relationship. #publicschools
@StacyBrewer18 @transition2017  you were a fabulous choice! Good luck Betsy!!
Ms. DeVos, please address the issue of Muslim curriculum support from your past. How recntly & to what extnt TY
FINALLY, SOMEONE WHO PUTS CHILDREN FIRST! Congratulations Betsy!
I can assume correctly that all comments are not in your best interest. You're a joke!!!! Thanks @transition2017!
I need help in Silver Springs Nv.  The school system is broken.  Can't handle a 9 year old.  Cowboy!
greatly wish for you to smell my tush
Remember when teachers (EXPERTS)had the final word on the education of children,&WE WERE#1AMONG ALL THE NATIONS?
Betsy DeVos, Trump’s Education Pick, Plays Hardball With Her Wealth https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/us/politics/betsy-devos-education-secretary.html?smid=fb-share …
Happy to hear you support vouchers. Many kids get lost in system. Kids excel with different teaching methods.
keep Common Core out of American schools.
@RenziRenee @transition2017 get rid of common core. Leave our public schools alone
no one is interested in anything you have to say. kill yourself
You're completely unqualified. Go away.

I doubt you even know what it is.
Congratulations!! Time to abolish the Dept of ED!!
I truly hope that you are against Common Core.
focus on communities not charters as the answer. Education should not be for profit period.
defer this: congratulations on your first job!
Get rid of Common Core AND the Teachers Union.
congrats!  Being from #WestMichigan it's exciting to see you picked for this... I homeschooled for over 20 years
This coming from someone who funds #ALEC, the group writing anti-Democratic legislation?
You're delusional if you think there's support for a highly unqualified nominee such as yourself w/shadowy past.
Thrilled by your selection. Please, strip and change current system. Wilkes-Barre, Pa needs drastic change. HELP
Congratulations!
except, clearly, your comments regarding Common Core.
Please ignore the Twitter graffiti, they only speak for triggered 2 percent and are a reflection of our failing education
no common core
Did he grab your pussy?
Yea, vouchers..
Question. Did your kids enjoy public school? And what was your favorite job working in schools?
Congratulations & blessings! Rid this great nation of common core please
@TrussElise @transition2017 welcome aboard the Trump Train all aboard
Congratulations!! Trump only picks the Best!
Congrats on your Sec.Ed. nomination. Look forward to working with you to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain @BetsyDeVos @transition2017
I don't support you at all. Were charter schools invented to segregate?

a brilliant choice
don't know why trump would nominate crooked Betsy #crookedBetsy for #cabinetpick sad!
End Common Core then end Dept. of Education.
DeVos family destroyed MI school system.  She would like to privatize school.  All children deserve a education
Teacher's Union came out with a statement that she is highly unqualified and will destroy public education
EDUCATION SHOULD BE NO PARTISON.  SHE RAISED MONEY TO BAN GAY MARRIAGE.   BAD CHOICE
@hale4jesus @transition2017 We need a MAJOR change! Kids today are abused in the public schools!
Teachers are abused!  Please bring respect for teachers and America back!
we are NOT interested and DO NOT support you #shame #shame #deporable
Betsy Devos raised money, a lot of money, to ban gay marriage.  I do not want her around children, period.
No comment. I am satisfied. thank you!
be honest. You don't care about education. You care about profiting off charters.  And it's all based on lies and deception.
stand up for all kids including those in traditional public schools hurt by the hateful rhetoric of Trump's campaign.
another unqualified @gop taker, a perfect fit in @realdonaldTrump #PondScumCabinet. https://twitter.com/_jeffguo/status/801494891306090497 … @transition2017
Wondering what Betsy DeVos will to do the nation's schools? Look at what she did to Detroit: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/us/for-detroits-children-more-school-choice-but-not-better-schools.html … 
U guys need to give schools alternatives to AP/SAT which spawned CommonCore devs. They control curriculum's
Congrats!!!  MAGA!

Many of you are asking about Common Core. To clarify, I am not a supporter—period. Read my full stance, here: http://betsydevos.com/qa/ 
Hoping something will be done about teacher absenteeism.  Kids get subs on a daily basis these days.  #education
Need uniform measures of progress in Eng. & math to determine adequate remedies for disabled under IDEA & ADA.
Congratulations! Brought some sunshine to the rainy day on Lake Mac. Would love to get involved and help in new admin.
NO COMMON CORE FOR OUR CHILDREN!!!
Congratulations!!!
Bring America the school choice it needs to give these drop-out factories we call schools some competition!
Congratulations Betsy!
Can't wait for school choice!!!!
why divide tax dollars among additional school options and not simply improve existing infrastructure?
Amway Forever.We Love Pyramids.Haha.
Congratulations. Pls no Common Core & support charter schools & vouchers!
.@BetsyDeVos @transition2017 would love to hear sooner than later on plans for building on #CsForAll momentum to explains CS in schools.
Pussy Galore.I Must be Dreaming.Haha.
Congrats @BetsyDeVos @transition2017 Great news for school choice! Great news for all students!
Godspeed. Congratulations. Best of Luck.
Congratulations on the appointment! #MAGA #MEGA (Make Education Great Again!)
By hiring someone who's never spent a day in a public school!  How clueless is our society.
Most teachers have never worked in prvt sect either, where most kids have to work.
You've never been a teacher or worked in a school. I'm sure this will work out great.
We probably need someone coming from outside the system—people within are institutionalized.
Vouchers. Charter schools. The privatization of education is what she advocates. No thanks.
Why not? Common core and govt-run education before that were disasters.
Are you familiar with the cons of a voucher system?
Tell me.
Private religious schools are not required to accommodate students with disabilities-- even when they receive vouchers
anti-gay trash.
@datrumpnation1 @transition2017 Very happy with your appointment.
best wishes! If you need staff w/experience at all levels of education, including government, I'm ready 2 serve!
Sounds like more big government. We need to make educational decisions in our own communities.  GOV out of sch.
#Education industry can learn from #FarmersMarket s. Fresh, local, sustainable. #ParentsShop #School #Choice #Charter #Local Win
congratulations!
@pambesteder @transition2017 Congratulations 
destroy the common core. ITS ONLY MAKING EDUCATION WORSE
not an educator, Mega donor and research shows NO gains with school vouchers. But that makes no diff eh?
time to ban common core once and for all
Please rid us of common core... & Congrats, you look like a wonderful person to take care of our KIDS education!
how does somebody "look" like they will take care of our kids? She is proud CC supporter btw
Proud to be Dutch :)) Gefeliciteerd mevrouw de Vos  @transition2017
Please get rid of the onerous Common Core, altho we  the Classical Christian sch. our child's been attending.
Congratulations Betsy! God Bless You!
