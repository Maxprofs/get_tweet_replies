Trump was hiding in college under his wealth. He doesn't know the real America.

Rep. Lewis You have served Well, but you are Living on Your PAST merits.  it is time to turn the reins over to another..NOW
You are a true American hero and I have so much respect for you. THANK YOU.
Good for you. Proud moment. Now, what have you done for us lately? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. DO YOUR JOB. Quit living in the past.
And then you sold out to @ClingonHillary. "Bernie Sanders wasn't there." #FakeNews
That it was their 3rd attempt is an important point 2 remember. Younger people have the impression that u stomp you foot 1x & things change?
And you have been race pimping ever since. You should be in the racism hall of fame.

@RyanGosling vows to #KeepThePromise to help support human rights in #Congo #DRC @esrailian  https://twitter.com/Saphnatpanea/status/856183122769174528 …
Dr king would not march with you today. He would call you a hypocrite. Everything he stood for  you are against . Black cloud
Stop using his name&fame in vain. You are a traitor to MLK! You are nothing like him. You are a Judas that sat at his table!
Thank you! Because of your courage so many of us enjoy untold freedoms today.
thank you for all your work regarding OBAMACARE!  United to impeach Trump and his cabinet.  No to Gorsuch!  No to 
Bannon!
And look where it got is
you want Obama back Mr. Lewis.  That's why you advocate for the Democrats.  We've had enough of his New World Order agendas !
@RyanGosling vows #KeepThePromise 2support @hrw in #DRC @esrailian
