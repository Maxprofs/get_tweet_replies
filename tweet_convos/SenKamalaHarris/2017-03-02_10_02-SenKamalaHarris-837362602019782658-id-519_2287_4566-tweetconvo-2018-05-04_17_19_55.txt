Why wasn't California AG @SenKamalaHarris prosecuted?? Falsified transcript of confession.
No, she didn't, as the article states. A Republican named Robert Murray did that. He ran as a Republican for the CA-19 house seat in 2014.
BS. 
@SenKamalaHarris
Did you even read the article you're linking? She falsified nothing. She defended it (she's a lawyer). Reading isn't your strong suit, huh?
This is Ms. Harris’ third strike in hardly as many months—and those are only the ones that have come to our attention.
That's how Jared Kushner's NY Observer spun it, but the article is clear: the prosecutor in question was Robert Murray, not Kamala Harris.
She was his boss, read more than just the headline
You literally have to read more than the misleading headline to find out the prosecutor in the headline isn't the woman in the picture.
@SenSchumer will u b asking same of the Democratic senators that met with the Russian ambassador or we playing for cameras
It's not who met with him it's who lied about it and the context in which those meeting took place. Simpleton statements...get a clue.
20 of 26 on Defense Committee who responded whether they'd met with Russians said no. 6 didn't respond to inquiry.  So wasnt typical to do
Nevertheless, he lied #RemoveSessions
Lol keep ur dr am alive
Darn investigators.  Maybe they should stop looking into whether our election was compromised. NOT.
Shameful repubs care more about emails than our election. Our electn ahh! "Its a nothingburger!" But when it came to emails, "Lock her up!"
@SenSchumer Did you only listen to the abbreviated question. Shame on you ex DA
#Sessions admitted meetings between #Comey & #Trump didn't see as problematic unless they discussed probe, guess what that is what they were
@SenSchumer Kamala why didn't you agree when Holder and Hillary lied. Dems have become obstructionist.
Obstructionists as in not giving Merrick Garland a hearing?! 
You know you are wrong on this subject. No decision on any one until after election. The Dems used that last time. Know your history.
You go girl
U r using my thots against me too fast, I can't think that fast; going hyperspace slomo Southern drawl; time expired;mint julep?
You go ,girl! Hold his feet to the fire. They tried to shut you up and you just gave it back.
Over and over again.  
Trump said. “I’m no different from a politician running for office. You always want to put the best foot forward.”
Sessions look so much better preface lift. This tape dated 1/13/99 his face looks like it can move. He got mad Tues. he was expressionless.
U HAVE R PERMISSION AND BLESSING. 
REMIND AMERICA WHO CRASHED WALLSTREET, GAVE US REAGANOMICS, TX CUTS 4 WEALTHIEST,  CAUSING MORE POLLUTION
Damned shame he wasn't instructed to answer the question asked. Burr not an evidentiary expert or trial judge. You did well.
Wow!!!!
@SenSchumer where were you defending  justice when Lynch/Clinton were meeting on the tarmac. Why wasn't Lynch recused?
What would she be recused from? The DOJ wasn't investigating her. 
Don't try to explain it.  It's a waste of time.
True!
Liar Liar .....
You know republican hipocracy @KamalaHarris They lie constantly. Look at @McConnell hiding healthcare plan and rushing it. They are evil.
Can AG Sessions be held in contempt for refusing to answer the Senate Committee, and failing to invoke any viable privilege?
Sessions you are buddies get the president to stop lying.  Teach him how to be honest.
Sessions lied to Congress, how is he qualified to teach honesty?
@jeffsessions Kamala has got your number!!
Oh great and glorious burn!
The problem is Sessions is not honest neither is Trump, Flynn, Kushner, Rodgers, Coats and the list goes on the world is watching
Too bad he doesn't believe his own words.
Hello Senator, 
PLEASE REMEMBER LAST 8 YRS! 
IF DEMOCRATS R2 B RELEVANT,  U MUST GET AS,PSSD-OFF AS WRKRS R.
GO HAIR-ON-FIRE, BATSHIT ON GOP
The problem is:You lied under oath, either on purpose, carelessness or stupidity thinking no one will know?
Even gave us a lecture on honesty.   Right? 
When he wasn't remembering, forgetting or not recalling.
He's a traitor, as is @POTUS @realDonaldTrump both should be unemployed.
@SenSchumer so let's get the last two Obamas AG's back on the stand! Corruption at the highest liberal level. Silence
Oh please stick with your own country's politics and leave ours alone, troll
@SenSchumer
is this a Trump supporter's attempt at a Meme? Slow clap, it's 2017 how embarrassing for you.
Your posturing was lame. If you're the best the Dems have then #trump2020
It's great when you can use someone's own words to make a point. :)
Honey ur on a witch hunt.hard to tell truth about something u didn't do.If you didn't do something there isn't a untruth that goes with that
Don't let them get away w/ letting Sessions off the hook! Do we need a teleprompter facing him with his own word's or what? #GrillAndDrillEm
Is there an "OBSESSED WITH THIS TWEET" button?? Like is an understatement #SessionsHearing #ResignNotRecuse #Impeach45
Not Stonewalling... Sessions does not serve justice...obstructs!
He was trying to give honest testimony but you wouldn't let him because he wasn't saying what you wanted to hear.
Obama COLLUDED with Russia. It's on video. In the open. Democrats said nothing because democrats hate the USA
You are a rude obnoxious woman. You just want to hear yourself talk and don't give anyone a chance to respond. Quit barking at people
What good do your theatrics do 4 American people?Still no collusion proof Holder claimed same confidential limit as Sessions in testimony
Surprised you didn't rush in and interrupt him when he said it.
That racist POS doesn't have an honest bone in his tiny, elf body.
OMG! Massive fire in London. Entire high rise on fire!!
Practice what you preach.

He a lying two-faced disgrace to his profession as lawyer and our country as both Sen and AG PERIOD disbarment prison time for Obstruction 2
You are the problem, #JeffSessions. You say one thing ~ honesty, but sprouted evasion ~ "I do not recall" ~ no guts to even deny.
Does the name John Mitchell mean anything? Would be a very good time for Sessions to aquaint himself with a bit of history.
Keep fighting the fight!
He can't remember this statement, either.
You could have easily QB 7'd Jeff Sessions with another 5 minutes
Great job today sen Harris
#RussianAmnesiaEpidemic
He was honest, he doesn't think he has to tell you so he won't Make him if you can your problem not his. Quit whining

Well, I do declare, he was just so NERVOUS.
.@SenKamalaHarris @pdacosta 
Innuendo aside, do you have a specific accusation that Sessions lied? Please, do tell. @WBPetersen
Sessions is hiding if something ....snake
We love you Kamala, you remind me of another young senator who became prez, hint hint #Kamala2020
But only when it's Democrats testimony.
Yeah right Mr Sessions, this videotape hasn't aged well... Not an honest bone in your whole body today though!
You ha e no case and no class
If you would shut your lipstick long enough you might have caught he was answering WTH? You took your heels off too soon.
#Holdmydrink
Nothing he did today ran contrary to that...
Nice catch, Senator
I agree. The Republicans have lowered the bar on honesty and integrity.
Apparently he doesn't! @jeffsessions
You were very unprofessional today
A liar can remember if he's told the same lie or not. .hard to keep up!
Uh oh. We've been duped. Someone kidnapped the real Jeff Sessions and put an android in to testify in his place. #area51 #Terminator #liar
wow, no trust
@shrimpfingers 

I meant others.

Not me.

Only others.
@tresamused all them years of experience you really learned how to lie well
please vote against opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. #OurWild
LIBERALS HAVE NEVER GIVEN HONEST TESTIMONY PLUS WE HAVE HAD YEARS OF SUFFERING UNDER LORETTA LYNCH'S INJUSTICE.
we also expect to have intelligent honest senators but that didn't stop you from being elected
@SenSchumer That would be nice but liberal democrats lie everyday! You young lady are part of the problem!
You have got to be kidding...
@SenSchumer Jeff sessions spoke the truth!!
@SenSchumer but you lied anyway to congress , AG to Congress
@SenSchumer I agree! So why didn't @HillaryClinton or @billclinton go to prison? So confused!
he even offerred MORE of an answer than AL was asking! You know better. Political immoral discusting u r
BUT ITS OK THAT Hillary was working for China and selling Uranium to Russians? U r so sick and immoral
LIVE AND SUPPORT AG Jeff Sessions!  We stand behind you united!!
FROM The MOST DISHONEST OF THE BUNCH!
You are all out for a fishing expedition. He did not lie. Turning on a fellow Senator is extremely low down.
@SenSchumer he didn't lie, merely answered the question that was asked
@SenSchumer And we bet you never met with the russian either
Fast & Furious, Benghazi, IRS, etc. Obama, Holder & Lynch just to mention a few should be investigated if we want JUSTICE!
Cucky is a bad person.Nothing positive2bring2the table for hurting Americans.I am sooooo sick of his badgering.
You guys/gals do know you lost the last election, right?
@theTonyGee  @jeffsessions the man is not a patriot; he is ahuge coward hiding behind pen & paper; cannot face his accusers

.@POTUS So…this all yet another in a string of coincidences? 
1. https://twitter.com/khanoisseur/status/837418418726805504 …
2. https://twitter.com/khanoisseur/status/837418959443877888 …
That's very good you agree! Now use that same semblance of integrity to stop spreading fake news and false accusations.
@SenSchumer bigot
I think these so called Senators that think their above the law should be removed asap then if they lie under oath auto out
@SenSchumer Dems wouldn't understand honesty if it bites UR ass.  Dems have lied to American people enough
I agree honesty is important. He did not lie. Now explain Hillary and e-mails,. and others in that party
#we are not impressed or fooled by this unimpressive fool of a human...
@SenSchumer If caught in lie, just use the word Adolph Hitler, that will fix it. Most think this is witch hunt.
@SenSchumer Investigate everyone in Washington, since they all have suspicious things hiding in the closet.
@SenSchumer Get Trey Gowdy in and clean up the swamp.
@SenSchumer he's been around a long time he knows he lied under oath hate when they lie to cover lie! Resign!!!
#Soros Son & Putin ... #impeachschumber.
@SenSchumer So we can prosecure Holder now? Thanks Koala look forward to it.
@MelanieSmith82 "Honest testimony, but not from me," said the Keebler Elf.
Funny you didn't think honesty was important when Hillary was lying her @ss off under oath.  Dems have lost me
@SenSchumer  Keep doing what Ur doing, 2018 coming up n 2020 n I live in a Swing state, U just keep making my decision easy
@SenSchumer .he needs to step aside along with the rest of his party with all there wrong doinv
@SenSchumer no evidence of collusion or a crime committed, so what are you investigating is the Dem party Dummies, really !
@SenSchumer he is gonna take down the D.C.PEDOPHILE RING. THE RATS ARE SCARED AS HELL. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW IT..
That's right Jug ears
@SenSchumer , where were you when l.lynch and bill Clinton was meeting privately in a hanger 

Cspan records everything
@SenSchumer U both should b ashamed of yourselves, I voted 4 Obama , but I'm sick of petty politics so is rest of America.
@SenSchumer Schumer lets in child molesters
@SenSchumer Sessions form of Justice is Running around with a white sheet and pillow case on burning the cross
@SenSchumer @jasoninthehouse @TheJusticeDept The problem here AG is you lied under oath!! Top Cop knows better!!!
Right...Like EHolder & HClinton & MHayden & LLerner, etc, etc, etc. Like them?
more than 60% of American do too.  We're waiting 2 hear the truth on Benghazi,emails,Iran$$$,uranium & more
@SenSchumer yeah where was this message and your call on AG lynch and what about all the lies HRC did and Obama lied. Sad

all dem smoke screens...Sessions stays put.
@realDonaldTrump 
Agree.
& the complete lack of honesty and integrity seen in you and your traitorous cohorts is anti American. #corrupt
@SenSchumer interesting to see you guys scramble at loss of power. What ties do you have to human trafficking?
that Q directed at Chuck and too many politicos. What's on your hard drive bro
The rules are always just for the other guy according to RW hypocrites. #RWHypocrisy
@SenSchumer it should be clear that @realDonaldTrump and most of his Administration have NO PROBLEM w/LYING UNDER OATH!
@SenSchumer Honesty seriously....Clinton,Holder,Lynch,Brazille WTH is wrong with you people...Hypocrites!!!
Honest will certainly NOT come from people like you.
@SenSchumer it a very honest answer to a very direct question.
did you tell that to 30 pedophiles exposed in clinton emails, justice for the children is coming
This is an honest man ...
@SenSchumer Wow.
@MiaFarrow classic "practice what you preach" situation
He lied under oath period. It's time to go now.
@SenSchumer read the context of the question, he answered exactly what was asked. Next time ask the question or shut up.
@SenSchumer You're a liar too. Same as Flynn. To say now you might have talked to someone  but not sure about what. BULL.
Which is exactly why Hillary & Holder must be prosecuted for lying under oath
Yet, you could have cared less about Hillary dealing with Russia while SOS, huh?  Double standards at its finest!
@SenSchumer 
 where was justice when Eric Holder ran guns & was in contempt of congress & never prosecuted? HRC 33k emails?
You no NOTHING of honesty, morality or decency. You are just a butt hurt Dem with no power. Suck it.
Sessions is honest and you are not. Democrats are only trying to cover up all of the crimes of the Democrat party.
None of that is true.
yet it's okay for @SenSchumer to let some athlete in w/o proper veting & now arrested for child sex assault? Promoting Ped?
@SenSchumer
This man has more honesty n him than you will ever dream4. This is a man of GOD. He fears GOD! Liars like SHUM'Rgo2hell.
@SenSchumer well except for now and for me! 
" Lock him up"
Gop is at fault, "cause they care more about the party instead of the Democracy of our Country.
