@maudglib
If only people would stop electing people that say government can't work, those ghouls would never wield power.
The problem is politicians bought and paid for that work in favor of corporate sponsors instead of constituents.
@LovesTheJust Pro-life only means birth. After that? Meh...
thank you for fighting for everyone and for standing up against Drumpf and is Ayn Rand ideology #resist
I thought you wanted to kill babies by promoting abortion,  now you worry how to feed them? Pick your battles!
#TrumpWarOnAmericans is clearly evidenced in the #TrumpBudget & #TrumpCare
Why do liberals always use the kids? Liberals let government get bloated and bankurpt, someone has to fix it.
heres an idea.unexempt congresss from obamacare.after all if its good enough for us then its good enough for you.
Seniors who want to eat and no one is going to Sesame Street. Apparently the swamp to be drained has too many old and poor.
This is obscene. Why is it taking so long to impeach him. #trumprussia
sounds like a federal version of California prop. 187 from the 90s sucks the courts overturned the will of the people #MAGA
With changes like & health care, EPA, NO point in increasing military budget, There wont be anything left to defend.
He does not care.
OUTRAGE. People should be in the streets protesting. And I'm sure they will be. #RESIST Thanks for all you do, Sen. Harris!
Indeed. How long before we put an end to this nonsense?!
Methinks it's French Revolution time (because if we wait much longer it will REALLY be FR time).
I feel very very sad n teary
Important to keep in mind that these jackasses are "pro-life"
Just until birth, then not so much
@WhitMcMo okay Senator Harris, when will he be impeached, this country is going down hill quick, we can't repair it
until he is out of this office. Ppl of this country are embarrassed and our allies are pretty upset with Trump.
Meanwhile, you support programs that provide abortions targeted to low-income families and kill babies in need. #defundpp #equalityforALL
someone put crack in your weed lady.
@damonbethea1   So sad. SMDH!!
.@SenKamalaHarris Trump's budget is dead without 60 Senate votes. It better not get even one Democratic vote, if @TheDemocrats are viable
@terri_barwick 
so saddened everyday by Trump news. It makes me feel physically ill!
Myself I am ready to just lay down and stop...everything. After he kills us all no one left to laud him. Serves him right
There's a special place in HELL for Liars like you!  Dems lie to people constantly.  This is the DEM PLAYBOOK!  Disgusting! Deplorable!
@GravityisRising We hear it loud and clear. Sad part?  After the election? We prepared. The Trump voters need to be prepare
why? I just don't get it.
BAD FORM 
I don't understand what is going on. Did he become president just to make more money with his company?
@JoseCanYouSeeOO Wait...I thought R's loved babies.
@ealight461 The administration that thinks starving ppl is a great way to balance the books. #GetThemOut
do you need a safe space? President Trump is ending entitlement, you can keep paying though if you wish!
this is nothing short of class warfare. Republicans need to wake up!
he wants to kill the poor and old people
what's next, concentration camps?
OH MY LORD TRUMP IS KILLING BABIES! You can't be serious with your tweets bc if you are HOW.... oh wait...you're from cali
he will say "states" can better serve ...tries to shift the issue @realDonaldTrump
#budgetcuts #TrumpRussia #TrumpLies #resist
definitely the #WorstBudgetEver
2018 is gonna be one hell of a ride.
If @KYComer supports this budget which jeopardizes those most at risk--the poor and the little ones--I will personally
...campaign for your replacement.  This @GOP budget has no conscience.  Starve a person to build a wall???
Can congress and the president be charged with depraved indifference?
@cliffbaker9 @GOP @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems Trump/Bannon with GOP legislation will reduce America to a 3rd World country.
...he done lost his mind!
politicians are middlemen/women, between us and the top %.  We need to take them back as the Constitution requires.  #vote
evil sick man!

because he wants all except wealthy dead or "kept" in check
Let them freeze, let them starve, let them eat cake!  #impeachment
It's like @realDonaldTrump has declared war on the poor. The 'war on poverty' has ironically taken a gruesome turn.#budget
this is so insane! Please make sure congress starts over w a new budget don't even consider this one!
this can NOT happen.
how is he getting away with this? You must be able to do something. Every passing day is another stab in the back.
he is a sick man. Half of his female voters were probably on WIC at some point.
@POTUS #45 is such a caring person that it makes most people sick just thinking about him!
More fear mongering from no idea having Democrats. We are 20T in debt sweetheart. what happens when it collapses?
Ma'am, you know that what you are saying is misleading. The cuts are in there but the admins of the programs will move
funds as needed so no babies or heat-needing families will suffer. Problem is Social Programs are,despite propular beliefs,
is the biggest federal expenditure, not the Pentagon. And as more people are added to it, it's cut of the federal budget
will continue to grow. And it MUST be paid for. We cannot borrow our responsibilities forever. Cost must be brought under
control and programs will be affected. You will trot out the sad situation with no context or solution. Disingenuous 
we know spicier will tell us alternatives #lies
when the diablo and his spawns our gone our country needs to find our way back to the compassion/empathy we use to be
That's so they can die and not be a drain on the billionaires who are trying to run this show.
great awareness keep coming with the facts
I effin can't stand this!!! This is bigger than party, these folks need this help!
the formula is sold for money to buy crack and heroin. Heat cannot, by law be disconnected when temperatures reach freezing
unless of course you have oil and your tank is empty...
wood burning stove.
@SayHillYes  love the fetus, hate the person. I can't even...every day is a new assault on us and our country.
@SayHillYes The rich get richer the poor get poorer..his KKK dad taught him everything he knows!
DJT has 2 be stopped! He is leading this country straight 2 the Hoover days! People will be hungry, homeless soup lines!
I'm beginning to suspect he is trying to be as big a monster as he can.
@leeladaou @SenKamalaHarris Shameful.
And will cut aid to the poor in the same amount that we spend for him to spend merely one day at Mar-A-Lago
should cut military spending first, but both D's and R's are on board with the war machine
thanks for fighting for our needs!
Trump is #notmypresident and I will never address that POS in that manner. #StayVigilantAmerica #Resist #NoBanNoWall
@ShawnaLeneeShow He makes me just wanna vomit!
But those babies need choice. @SenKamalaHarris @thomassee1215
I hate him
@DianaHollins this is no budget! This is an attack on American people!! Trump cares only about making HIMSELF great & RICH!
He seems not to want to run for a second term, scorched earth candidate.
apparently they don't really want that. What they want is to not die from terrorism, so they want a wall.
#unpresidented
Unbelievable.
Kamala, seriously though - why does the WH say that "efficiency" matters more ONLY in depts they wish to cut?
Where has working for the people gone to in Washington?The Republicans just seem more and more like a heartless bunch.
Quit scaremongering. No President's budget has ever been enacted. Get serious
Trump has to go!
he wants to kill Americans
Reminds me of Econ class.The old Guns and Butter debate. Cold war is over yet Guns still getting an awful lot of the budget
BUT, on the other hand, we'll have a larger military because wars aren't fought in cyber, they're fought-- oh, wait...
you are a puppet not the brains
