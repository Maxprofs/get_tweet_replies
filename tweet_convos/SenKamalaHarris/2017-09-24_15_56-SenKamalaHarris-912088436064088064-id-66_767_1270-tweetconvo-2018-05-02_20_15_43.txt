I am truly appreciative of your fight
Not  if  you  vote all againt Democrats and just few Republicans.  But for a good plan you need like 100 Democrats and 40% Republicans.
all against.
For a work behind the scene ?Maybe sometimes with Donald Trump  himself.   Results first but  intelligent results, good.
Thank you for your strong stance! Love from SF!
If Congress truly cares about the people who voted them to Washington, they will vote NO to this bill!!
You left this mess and so did OBAMA
It would be a disaster for my state of Oregon too! How did something so unfair get this far?!
Yes, because you're a Sanctuary City and the rest of the TAXPAYING country are paying for CA. Illegal costs of healthcare, for (D) votes.
I support you but this is not a states issue it is a human rights issue
why didnt single payer pass in CA where Dems have a super majority? ans. because dems are taking $$$$ from big pharma and Ins.
I wasn't suggesting she was fucktard, just making a point about legalized graft and its effect on our party

Good luck shutting it down, it's amazing how many of your fellow congressional leaders hate Obama care and would replace with nothing
Awesome.  Screw that screwed up state and all the little snowflakes that live there
Of course it's not coincidence that CA is getting hit hardest.  CA had the most votes against trump.
Why did you agree to a $84-billion increase to our already bloated military budget?  Now more than 3x the next biggest military budget.
Keep #Calling!
My  bella  my    love  mi senadora. Que tengas. Un    gran. Día
But a triumph for any senator who flipped and put his/her own state's gain (and personal political future) over the nation's loss.
You are already a disaster for California
Please talk to CA members of the House, including GOP.  We may need them.
I thought we were trying to get a Single Payer in place, would that matter?
That's the point of it hurt and kill blue state voters
To send more $$ to the red states where they don't care about health coverage for their residents. And they will use the $$ to screw people
California is one of 4 states with a total of 20% of the population and they get 40% of Fed $.Is that fair for the other 46 states? Hell No.
California could afford healthcare for citizens if it stopped spending billions each year on illegal aliens. Start working for Americans.
That's because CA is mismanaged.
Of course the clown in the white house hate Cali and that may be why you will take a major hit. Hopefully the bill will not pass.
Don't worry about Cali! Brown and his Democrats will just raise taxes again. Freeloaders and cave dwellers must pay...and pay...and pay.,,,,
Withhold tax dollars from the Feds see how that works out for these tReacherous tReasonous tRaitors
How can the richest country in the world deny universal healthcare?
Cutting health care = tax cuts for millionaires. They must be hurting more than the rest of us since the GOP thinks they need more $$.
And not a right is to say greed comes before humanity
As a repulsive bill, it takes away from blue states and gives it to the red states. That republicans can say that healthcare is a privilege
California had the chance to pass single payer and failed.
Your right because politicians like you have no idea how to balance a budget without raising taxes your pathetic
If YOU think it will be a disaster, then it must be good.
It was designed to hurt CA the most too. DR PRICE who has a reputation for treated the poor has just destroyed that. Graham works for Koch.
I may be mistaken, but isn't he supposed to be President of all 50 states? Please keep fighting.
And it's a petty political attack. The #GOP threatens American lives for their own selfish purposes. They are the worst side of politics.
Now it makes sense why they want this so bad. They'd like nothing better than to bring Cali to its knees. Ha! Not happening!
In hindsight,  should have voted for #SB562, huh?
USA is $20,000,000,000,000 Twenty Trillion in debt.  STOP SPENDING $.
And a disaster for Massachusetts.
"TrumpCare" ?huh? Another story...More HARM to some states than others. But just plain harm. #ComeBackWhenYouHavePlanForAll #WhenUGiveAShit
Thank you Senator
The bill is so constitutional. ARTICLE 10. CA takes a hit because received a disappropiate amount of money. You should be on board with this
then maybe you should get on rendon about doing what the people of california want done, huh?
.

No dip wit @SenKamalaHarris

Stop your lies

 @JerryBrownGov and you @DNC  

Made a mess of things for years to come

Stop your lies

.
Where are Dems strategy? Will be worse post mis terms and yet?
So glad you are not as easily distracted as others. Thank you for your service, Senator.
This continual assault on the ACA has got to stop.....imagine if they put half that effort into fixing Obamacare .....People over Party
Better yet, imagine that lib politicians like Kamala put their $ where their mouths are and demanded California start a single-payer system.
Why can't CA operate its own single payer system?
CA is a disaster.
hi Senator @SenKamalaHarris   what can you do to help the people of PR?  thanks
