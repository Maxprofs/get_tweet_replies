@Bethpikegirl so if we privatize the @WhiteHouse, then we can buy the logs?
Didn't we already?
President Obama never let media see his visitors when IRS and Lois Lerner  as well  as Mr. Koskinen visited
Defer, deflect, deny. That's how he works.
Actually, Kellyanne is using Rosetta Stone to translate the  vistor logs from Russian.
#Impeach45 Impeach the idiot orange menace.
Nazi are flew in from all over the country to sack Berkeley. What are you doing to protect our citizens?
Fake news from a fake Senator
She literally just repeats the same three talking points over and over again. She has to be the dumbest senator maybe even above @alfranken?
Franken isn't dumb - He is just plain dishonest. She is dumb.
Make no mistake they are covering their tracks. This comes on the heels of @DevinNunes midnight WH rendezvous to get documents.  
What hipocrits!  Maxine Waters - don't be distracted - 
Trump/Russia gate is the issue!
This is exactly what I said yesterday!!! Thanks for being my voice in DC.
Elected politicians shall represent the people, and not trashing consumer protection. Trump works against the people. #resist #TaxMarch
Now, if Congress could get together and get constituent privacy and @Whitehouse information.
Not good-transparency is disappearing one item at a time!
Poor democrats
This is NOT OK What R U Doing About This?? #resist #indivisible
Vote every GOP out that voted to give our privacy over to big puisne as for their profit. Not a single citizen wanted privacy invaded.
Stop construing it. Those privacy rules were written by Obama to favor pro-Liberal companies Google/Facebook & hurt ISPs for ad competition
that one time at band camp when you watched a spider wrap up a bug n stash it off to the side of the web.
@IndivisibleTeam @WhiteHouse all done under Mr Obama.
He was there 8 years trump 80 days, hhhhmmmm, that sucks for you.
They also want to tell me what to do with my body, but let's not dare restrict their guns.
@resister_sister @WhiteHouse Doesn't take a genius to know why with @FLOTUS living in NY....once a cheat, always a cheat
What? You mean there are repercussions to acting like children and trying to ruin everyone who has anything to do with Trump???? NO WAY!
This is the people's house! We have a right to know who has access to the President! Sen Harris et al-demand transparency!

Maybe its time to give isil a chance. democrats keep kickjing us in the teeth
Criminals are prone to deceptive behavior. #45 is deceptive. #theputintapes
@IndivisibleTeam @WhiteHouse--Yes, this admin getting more & more perverted re interests of constituents
thats your fault. you built that
We MUST vote Trump & his swamp out of office. They are attempting to destroy USA! No transparency! #ProtectOurDemocracy #VoteGOPOutOfOffice
And destroy the commission that helps protect your vote, grant secret exceptions to their phony anti- lobby law, threaten to cut ACA funds..
Ain't that some 
It's just a little concerning. What's even more concerning is that the Secret Service can't get the full  Mar A Lago logs.
They already sell it , now it will be legal
Do something about it!
Smh 
people are notified when they sign up that their information may be released. We approve that or we can't use their services.THIS IS NOT NEW
The problem is that Trump & Company don't see this as a problem.
@DavidKoechner @WhiteHouse of course! Our President is all about Big Business not the little guy. Don't DT Sheep know that?
@SenToomey @RepRyanCostello What a disgrace that you continue to be Republican puppets and not stand up and say how wrong this is!
Kamala why weren't you upset with Obama only realeasing them with many names eliminated? Hypocritical much?
Look!  Over there!  Something else
Yea it's pretty clear that people and their lives don't matter...
WTF
Can't see taxes, visitor logs at White House or Mara lago. And republican pass Internet Privacy Invasion Bill and won't ask trump for taxes.
National security, Obongo had muslims, black extremist thugs ans socialist in N out all the time
FML
EXACTLY
@IndivisibleTeam @WhiteHouse 
I don't get it! Is it stupidity or evilness?
I'm scratching head on that one too 
@verizon, @ATT, @comcast.  #WeThePeople will take back our Democracy from your @GOP puppets. #TrumpColluded #Resist
Privacy is only for the powerful these days.
VPN through TOR
How much is one person's #BrowsingHistory worth? 

Looks like, quite a bit actually.
Why are you doing nothing to protect citizens Internet privacy. Oh wait dems like the idea of selling people's data
. dear Sen Harris,HUD is a great place for trumpy companies to make millions.big construction easily corrupted

Yup...there you go 
Just wrong! #TaxReturns #TaxMarch #TrumpColluded
Republicans are letting this happen
Great comparison Kamala!!!
dear Senator Harris,would u please check and observe trumpy's Hud appointments.He fancies himself a builder.
@eqca @WhiteHouse We wish Hillary Clinton return the nuclear bomb parts she disembargoed for Russia.
Outrageous
Trump is simply a prick.
Then this Nation a Government of the people, YES! has certain laws also civic rights that are fair or not. Sen.Kamala Harris of CALIFORNIA
I've never studied  Professional Law such as yourself.Admitted TRUTHFULLY
Well, to be fair (painful as it is), that ISP failure started in Congress where it passed both houses. @JeffFlake owns that one.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS  It should be called the White House of lies and deception!!!!
The hypocrisy of these so-called patriots, "freedom and what have you" is stunning. #Resist #ImpeachTrump
Can we get Mar-a-lago visitor logs? He's spent 20% of his presidency golfing, so far.
Not much of an anology nor a safe assumption that all Cits would like to be told what to think.
oh the stupidity, will it never end! ye it will, in 4 yrs. two years for the asses in congress.
Obama refused release until he was sued into it. Could it be because ur a party hack and decided notvtrll us that or are you incompetent?
as my Senator I am depending on you to change this I know you have been trying but we need to do more 
I dont expect the other CA Sen to do much to oppose trump
Bozo the president doesn't want us to know whos  coming to visit! Maybe he has several girlfriends he doesn't anybody to know about
Neither actions are acceptable. #Resist
Hopefully Putin will release the videos soon. There are more and more of these every day..
Makes perfect sense, doesn't it?
