She's pretty damned impressive... I started out skeptical that she was ready for the Senate. No longer! She's a total badass!
I have 2agree that I2 am extra cautious now. We can't afford anymore mistakes.
First mistake....getting this person elected......You'll see.....
#CORRUPTION IN KAMALA HARRIS OFFICE:

Bummer. Sold out!

Wished I could go heckle you. I really don't like you. YOU represent the problems of MY country. Soros puppet

The word 'your' shows possession.  Try again.
So you don't know how to write it correctly.  Haha

Nah. Would rather sit for thumb screws.
Would someone actually pay to go see you speak? 
When will you be coming to the Los Angeles area? Would love to hear you speak!
I am confident you will be speaking of uniting the country, working across party lines and outlining your plans to work for the people?
Why don't you explain exactly what he did?!?Why was it ok for Obama to release KNOWN terrorists and violent felons?!? Hypocrites all of you?

Already sold out. You need a larger venue, Senator.
Not sure why anyone would even want free tickets to hear you spout off with lies and deceit.
it's sold out! I was on a text team encouraging ppl to go last night but no dice. Lots of ppl want to talk to you!
You have to be kidding.  Go to a town hall to ask a question and be talked over and interrupted.  Naw, I've got better things to do.
Bummed sold out.
Please visit LA 
Boy you sure are intelligent,how in the world did you get elected!!
Wonder how many you will screen so that only people who support your liberal agenda get in. Its the liberal way. Shut down the truth.

I wish I could meet you in person @SenKamalaHarris you are a true inspiration #WeThePeople #YesWeCan #WeAreTheMajority #WeAreADemocracy 
Wish I could, would love to be there to see the next possible 2020 candidate, but I am in Ohio. How about a Harris/ Kennedy 2020.
Do you know what a pardon is? Have you ever seen someone pardoned if they have not committed a crime? You are silly
GrandPa Sanders, age 79 in 2020 has ZERO chance.
#KamalaHarris2020
All lies are free, correct. WOW do you really suck...
When is your townhall? @DarrellIssa
Perfect for you!! All constituants with jobs  wont be there!! You can pander to the unemployed as you take advantage of them! 
I'm in CT and know how great it is to have senators fighting for their constituents. Oakland, show up and give Sen. Harris all your support.
Might have to do a little extra screening that day, Senator. Hope it goes smoothly.
Possibly Periscope?!  Would love to be there...2500 miles too far! Lol
We want to know about this:
Wow already sold out!
Really looking forward to seeing you in San Diego someday
@AlexKummert

LOOOOL @IngrahamAngle has the photo of the Cleveland Cavaliers NBA championship parade on her homepage as "Trump supporters." 
It's sold out
Thanks for the info

Tickets? We just show up in Oregon.
Lol true. Wish she could but California has 40 million people. The Bay Area has nearly 8 million. Oregon has 4 million.  Apples & Oranges.

Awwww...wish I could meet you Mrs Harris! Kamala Harris for 2020!
Already sold out - disappointed - would have liked to come
Wow - already sold out!?!
Hey Kamala, I hope you're considering Joe Kennedy as you're VP. It would insure 16 years of good government. You can be KamKen or kamaleddy.
If you can bitch slap trump in an intelligent and classy manner, you'll win the hearts and minds of every person who wants this mess to end.
Ooh! I'm from Boston, but I'd love to hear you. So far away!
aw, sold out already? Don't worry - I'm with you in spirit.
Tix already gone, within 53 minutes?

As a resident of South Dakota I'm amazed at the advance notice you give.
Love to see you come to San Diego.
Are you coming to San Fernando Valley in good old Los Angeles.
Come to Santa Cruz
Oh...i live in San Fernando Valley..
Otherwise....
Please answer whether you & other state officials should be held personally liable for damages caused by illegal aliens in sanctuary cities.

Is the DNC on this-- @tedlieu should resign immediately
And listen to you pander for an hour or two, nah I'm good. You're hurting your own people via your ignorance.
For example: raising the minimum wage makes it harder for people to get entry level jobs, effectively making starting a career difficult.
