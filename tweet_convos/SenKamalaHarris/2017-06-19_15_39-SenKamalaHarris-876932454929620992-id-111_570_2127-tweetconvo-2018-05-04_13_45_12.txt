Thank you so very much Sen. Harris for being there for the average citizen. You are very articulate, on point, empathetic.Hugs from my heart

You are an eloquent speaker. Anyone who would vote for a health care act that is not better than the ACA needs to get out of congress.

Majority of ppl with Obamacare have it for free but doctors don't want it bc is worse than medical .. disaster
Remember that in CA the majority of healthcare insurance drop from Obamacare.. nobody wants it here .. useless

Watching your Speaking on Senate Floor, on Health Care ;Sen.Kamala Harris, 5:45pm ct a free mins late.
You just ended Speaking on Senate Floor, I could not laugh quite the same way as yourself; (excuse me ) being for lateness also typo-error.
What we don't know about this bill will hurt us
To paraphrase Harry Truman, tell the truth and they will think it is hell...
Do anything you have to, but stop this. Please stop them.
Discussing GOP healthcare plan? Better bring your x-ray specs.
What plan your party claims not have seen a plan how can you talk about something you know nothing about oh that's right you're a Democrat
Represent K-Ha!
Will you be interrupting people and grandstanding? That is your M.O.
LOL.
I first read the word "live" as "vile"
You gave us Obamacare
I see you, but no one except that cabal has seen the bill
Tell McConnell to sit down and shut his pie hole. Object this.

Thank you for your work.
I'm proud to have you as my Senator.
Thank you for all the work you do.  I sleep better knowing you are on the right side of history.
I see you!
Our hero
Block the poor excuses for the people reps as they hid crap from dem's and America!
Don't let any old white man shut you up either Senator Harris!
Thank you Kamala for standing up for us!! Please continue to withhold consent! #ShowUsTheBill
