We should all stand with those not afforded the luxury of basic human rights.  Its called being a human being.
And explain why Saudi Arabia and Egypt were left out?  So confusing to 'libtards'...
It's not a #MuslimBan. Stop spreading lies, hate and division.
if that's your concern, direct it to the president.
Direct an outright lie to the President? How about I direct it to the liars like @SenKamalaHarris
oh it's not a Muslim ban? Please educate me what kind of ban is it lol
The seven countries listed were deemed by Obama to be threats before he left office. But keep lying and call it what it's not
Do you stand with American families who have buried sons and daughters killed at the hands of radical Islamic terrorists?
You do realize that many people trying to come here are terrorized by those same extremists, right?
Yes, so what's your point?
It is not a Muslim ban. I guess you want another San Berndino attack to push your #GunBan
Is a Lawless senator who favors foreigners over the safety of American citizens.  Mostly poor black citizens are harmed.
.@SenKamalaHarris 60% affected by new Muslim Ban are from Iran. Your millions of Iranian-American constituents need to hear you too
MILLIONS of Iranian-American constituents???
, Funny there is no text from you when Obama implemented the #MuslimBan
One billion Muslims in top ten countries. How many are affected? Zero.
Please consider running for our next President!
I'm proud I voted for you.  Keep fighting!
@realRogueLeader Is anyone going to enforce the law? Seeing #JeffSessions on TV, I could puke. He committed perjury. Wtf?
so go stand with them in their country. there is no muslim ban here
There is no Muslim ban, you fraud.
Please keep saying Muslim Ban. It clearly shows to everyone you're a demagogue.
There are a lot less people standing with you these days. Polls show maj of Americans say we need to slow down and vet.
It's just a re-packaging. NO #MuslimBan
Yes, our message can be "we stand by you", but in reality it means...what?  Can we do what needs to b done to override this
I'm also deeply concerned about the new Muslim Ban order and I thank the Senator for opposing it.
@KellyLMcKevitt Standing doesn't seem to be helping stop the daily horror stories of deportations tearing families apart
again you are untruthful.  It is a ban for all people from 6 countries.
you are a liar for calling it a Muslim ban
Does the EO say Muslim Ban? I haven't read it yet so unclear. Also, who are "WE"? You rep my state but not me!
of course it does not say "Muslim ban" because it is not
I'm ready for round 2
so all 57 countries and all Muslims are affected... Oh no wait now 6 of 57... Kinda wimpy ban... Like Obama wrist @SenKamalaHarris
u know this not a ban. When are you going to work with @potus and 4 tax paying citizens and legal immigrants here in So Cal that voted 4 u?
I don't.
. @SenKamalaHarris who's we? You have a mouse in your pocket?
Shut up.
Why don't you go to Syria and stand with them? That would be a powerful gesture.
She represents California, she represents me. Thank you, Senator Harris! #resist
the families you stand with, are they Americans who fear more terrorism in the US? Of course not, your're a liberal!
So what you're saying is that it's rational to fear immigrants from Muslim majority countries.
In case you did not know, Steve Jobs' biological father was Syrian. Had this ban been around...no Apple.
yes indeed!!! U r not alone!
thank you AMARICAN People
Do you still not understand why you traitors lost? Keep digging the hole so we can get an EASY 8 years.
#MuslimBanprotest #powertothepeople #TheLastAmericanDream
@VanJones68 Standing up to Trump's #MuslimBan2 in defense of #TheLastAmericanDream #WeThePeople 
then go stand in Syria and fight with them to take back their country
who voted for you?
If you are committed to our government functioning again you will get off your talking points and work from reality.
@JustSchmeltzer theysure fight huh. Lawd!
It is NOT a #MuslimBan. This type of thinking is what continues to fuel division, protests & riots in America.
were  are you coming from, do you not read what's happening  in Europe
this prevents US Embassies from issuing NEW visas. How do you stand with people in other countries who have no visas? 
And thus you will fall with them as well.
how many refugees are you personally footing the bill on and housing?
I challenge u to put up or shut up. Produce where the EO specifically targets Muslims. Ur irresponsible and should resign
#Stopislam
That's the problem right there. You're just standing. If you really care, you would walk forward and lead.
- What about the families of Americans murdered by #RadicalIslamicTerrorism - you & LIBTARDS ABANDONED?!
Thank you!
you need fired and removed
HOW exactly do you stand with them? Vague platitudes are NOT ENOUGH. What are YOU DOING to STOP TRUMP?
they surely weren't standing with them while obama bombed the shit out of the Middle East
if you are standing with foreign nationals, then you really need to resign as you are no longer representing Americans
represents me, also from California. Thank you, Senator Harris! #resist
