Your chickens came home Kamilla 
My sis died last yr of Glioblastoma like #McCain has #ACA kept her alive for 3 yrs longer-She was 44. 3 kids/5 yo twins. Pls vote #NoRepeal
Cher, thank you for sharing your story. My love goes to you and your family. @gop needs to see how detrimental their policies will be to us.
Thank you, Ezra. While it was a painful loss, the #ACA allowed her the comfort of hospice care & her desire to pass at home w/her loved ones
I can only imagine the comfort she had at home. My uncle passed away due to Lupus. I have a cousin living with Lupus and another uncle w/...
Parkinson's. They have insurance but ACA provides additional support with caps and pre-existing conditions. @GOP should focus on a #ACA fix.
Yes, my father just passed from Parkinson's 2 mos ago. Medicaid supplement allowed him in home care & phys therapy. Prayers to your family 
Thank you.
that's sooooo cute!
Keep it up, Senator Harris and thank you!
tell GOP. It's not the bill, it's the undemocratic ignoring if process, the destruction of Senate, the Koch agenda over us-the ppl
thank you
Bullshit
#KamalaHarrisforPOTUS thank you Senator for remaining true to our values as a nations and keeping the torch of truth from being extinguished
Thank you @SenKamalaHarris @KamalaHarris
Lost me after the first 7 seconds. Health INSURANCE is what we're talking abt. Not health care-big difference. Where is insurance guranteed?
how many times we hear it: 'it's for the children'.  You are a liar!
Thank you for your help in trying to #KeepKidsCovered
Thank you for yr tenaciousness. My aunt died an AF vet of lung cancer in June. Top rate palliative/hospice care at home. ALL VETS MATTER.
Kamala, they don't care.  You need to get to their corporate masters.  That is who is pulling the strings.
IF YOU FOUGHT FOR KIDS WHY ARE U FIGHTING SO HARD FOR ABORTION? YOU ARE SO HYPOCRITICAL! DO YOU GET A BONUS EVERYTHING ONE IS ABORTED?
Real question @KamalaHarris is do you support #medicareforall or do you just want to preserve the corporate give away that is ACA?
Thank you Kamala Harris!!  In a very scary political environment, I trust you and believe you have my best interests in mind.  
Thank you for your hard work~
Harris in 2020!!
It love this post
I lost my health insurance due to Obamacare… We need single payer... Nice pearl necklace Kamala
As Trump continues his best to turn our country upside down, we struggle to keep faith in our Democratic system, where both parties are to
Lost my plan & it was replaced by an ACA plan I can't I use at a 300% cost increase. Please do net "help" me anymore.
Unfortunately, the cave man mentality of the @GOP says healthcare isn't a right.
And millions w chronic illness.
#TheResistance
Love youKamaka Harris #strongwomen
Thank you. #HouseCallsCampaign is urging Medical Professionals to make the calls. Remember the Hippocratic Oath? DO NO HARM Call now
God Bless You Kamala
2 work together, so we remain unified as one. I'm not alone, when i say, if i had Trumps $ I'd get the hell out of this country!
@SenKamalaHarris thank you for all you do. How f-ing depressing and embarassing it is, to be an American. We ARE the evil empire.
How do human rights cost money? You're so far from the founding fathers and their ideas of unalienable rights.
Don't give up! Listen to  this senator. She is right! Your voice makes a difference. Your paid taxes,pays their salary. Make them listen!
Tired of this game.  Submit leg. that all politicians must use same health care as offered to citizens based on their state. DC has no insu.
@sftydc BS you just building a run for President...the Dems drank the Kool Aid once.
System is broken and no longer works .
Couldn't care any less about your thoughts on healthcare.  Hope you are running for pres in 2020 so I can watch you self destruct.
The #ACA saved my life 3x in 7 mo. I didn't go bankrupt or become homeless. If this new bill passes, I won't be so lucky next time.
Democrats destroyed my health care with ACA.  Tough to believe anything you say on the subject.
And no one even knows what they voted on.  Why are we paying these people? I would be fired for that behavior.
SHERO!  Kamala 2020
That's is disgusting using children who know nothing of what you are doing as props. TERRIBLE
If you were really worried about the harm to constituents you would - along with fellow Dems - work to fix this mess called ACA!
Thank you, Senator.
Sorry lady I tried to buy health care and I can't  ur right we are better than this so find a way... to make it better
My thanks to you, and all the Sens, for fighting to preserve our healthcare.
@SenKamalaHarris please run for President @tedlieu would be a great VP or the other way around. But we need people like both of you running.
@SenJohnMcCain #VOTENO #CBO #s=
17 MILLION LOSE THEIR HEALTHCARE NEXT YEAR 2018!
32MILLION IN 10YEARS!@SenateMajLdr@SpeakerRyan
You are amazing Senator Harris!!
Dear Senator Harris, 
What more can CA voters do to stop ACA repeal?  
Thank-you kindly.
Retired RN of 42 years. Devastated and frightened about current status of healthcare legislation. Feeling hopeless , no way to stop this
Senator, You are obstructing the will of the American people who put you in office!  Repeal & replace Obamacare monstrosity today! #MAGA
You're not fighting for anybody but the Clintons and the oligarchy. Don't fall for her people. She's FAKE NEWS on a FAKE MISSION 2save Dems.
Thank you for fighting on behalf of CA.
Kamala that you & the rest of our Democrat Senators for caring.
We are #grateful for your advocacy and compassion. 
#Grateful for @SenFeinstein as well.
#SaveMedicaid
#321Advocate
Thank you!
And to hell with the kids who lost their insurance because there parents can't afford the premiums and deductibles!
Fight fight and fight harder . Remember you are fighting against a heartless mobster who looks only after number one
Thanks to Kamala Harris for being a representative of the people. A class act. That she makes Sessions nervous is also a plus.
Please run for president!  @realDonaldTrump will mop the floor with you!
We need a national movement to get Kamala to run for president, she is the 'Better Deal' #KamalaHarris2020
.@SenSchumer #CensureMcConnell for shameful suborning votes as party loyalty oath. Uphold Senate tradition of open lawmaking for public good
Can you tweet a number - how many opposition calls you've gotten today?
Give em facts/#s; #s add gravity

Thank you for serving the people
Keep it up Ms. Harris!
You are the best! Thanks for fighting for everyone
@SenJohnMcCain Senator McCain....without insurance, who could afford the treatment that you get? Don't tell us we aren't worth it. Vote NO.

As someone who actually works in the healthcare industry each day seeing patients here in CA- U have no clue of what you are talking about.
Thanks --here people saying they think people will vote for MTP because McCain is coming back.
Thank you for standing up for all is us.
@LESTERJ205

Run in 2020. You have the charisma of Barack Obama and the Pragmatism of Hillary Clinton.
Hillary Clinton's our elected President

I am about to have a meltdown.  I have diabetes, chronic depression and am 60 years old.  Everything leads to me being screwed.
A Party may change laws but laws do not differentiate between Parties. @GOP voters is a part of the millions who will lose healthcare.
It's  not a plan if you don't  know how it going down and consequences  of your  actions
Thank you @SenKamalaHarris!! We love you!
@ThomasGundamW Harris 2020 for POTUS!
That's a new one civil right. Just like my right to a  Taylor ham and Egg on a hard roll ketchup salt and pepper. I pay for it.
Thank you for doing all you can to fight for all Americans.
Appeal to emotions....avoid facts and critical thinking.....
Go Kamala.
Sorry Kamala that doesn't work on them - they're too fucked up and never likely to realize!
@SenateGOP @HouseGOP should be told keeping @SenateDems out of the HCBill is slapping the faces of Americans! Democrats & Independent voters
#TKU @SenKamalaHarris #4TheFight #KillTheBill #VoteNo #SaveACA
