You go, folks!  Love you to death.
Senator Harris inflicted by AG Sessions bound and determined to blather on, chimp smile, and run out the clock.
Please run for POTUS!
When it's time. Not too soon.
I don't think 2020 would be too soon.  It could definitely be her time.  We need smarts & leadership.  She has both.
I think the more Capital Hill experience you have, the better & typically more effective president you make. I'd hate to see her run & fail
I think she'd have a really good chance with a good running mate.  I'm going to be watching her.  Really like what I see.  Time will tell...
I think she's the bomb!

Bravo &congratulations to you on your articulate questioning of AG Sessions. Please run for President of the USA! 
Wow..great show.
@SenKamalaHarris, you are proof that there is nothing more terrifying than a smart, articulate and well-prepared woman.  #nasty #resist
Which means Trump, the GOP & the Russians are already plotting her downfall. God forbid a woman should have a brain & an opinion


They're intimidated by you because you remind them of Obama. They're not ready for a strong intelligent well spoken African American woman.
I love u Senator, Savannah & my #birthstate crazy Stephen. SC made me nuts too. I don't get paid 4 it. I'm damned glad You do! #TheVapors
Thank you for your persistence. Thank you for representing ALL of us in trying to get factual information from the Hippocrate GOPs
Hilarious.
Wonderful!  Senator Harris please do continue with your verbs, nouns and courage.   - a devoted constituent
Brilliant 
I'm a lost Republican who admired your tough questions. Wish the GOP reps I helped elect had similar backbones.
With all due respect Senator, you're as worthless as tits on a boar.
Lmao! So sad that uninformed people can't and won't (and don't want to) understand the hilarity in this! #HoldtheFloor #ImpeachTrump
@SenKamalaHarris keep up the good work and don't let those curmudgeonly old men get between you and the truth!!
It's really true. Jeff Sessions is an embarrassment. Was an outlier, Senator, not respected by his peers.
Participles over principles!
Your are doing a GREAT Job Sen. Harris, want you know that.
I hope he now knows how to pronounce your name!
https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/735197253153914881 …
People pronounce my name many different ways. Let #KidsForKamala show you how it’s done. 
 the fainting couch




The vapors for Sessions.
Senator - you were awesome!  Nothing men hate more than a logical, dogged woman.  Please consider a run for President in 2020.
Love YOU.  Thanks from an American Woman!
What the hell was McCain thinking? Screw them all, it's your turn. Go get em Kamala!
8 years with Barack - SAAAWEEET! 
145 days with Don Cheeto - FUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!
Black Woman, Kamala Harris 2020 - PRICELESS!!

He is hilarious
Please continue to love them & don't back down from those questions. He wasn't even answering!


The Democratic party is going to be ok. 2016 us awoken something they can't deal with watch
I do declare.   Vapors.   Fainting couch.   Only one thing missing @StephenAtHome ... @jeffsessions clutching his pearls.
Hammer, meet nail head!
Just as long as I don't find out you've been using *MY* fainting couch without permission.
How sexist of Jason Miller to call Senator Harris hysterical.
Senator those men are *terrified* of you.  I think every republican in the room quaked when you began to talk.  WE LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What about the Oxford comma, though?
Thanks so much
As one strong, educated woman to another, I applaud you! And I'm glad you're my Senator. Keep up the good work!
AG Sessions sittin there, LYING through his teeth &havin the nerve 2 STRETCH THE lie 2waste time? I wanna slap him with gavel. #ICantRecall
love you Kamala!!
You like the rest of the  Democratic Party of  Obama  have not semblance to the  Democratic party of JFK. JFK loves his country Obama not
And between you and him, Those nouns, verbs &participles are JUST WORDS. When you use them they are poorly used.
@SenKamalaHarris is great representation for #Cali
Senator Harris, you are my hero.  Thank you for demonstrating intelligence in the midst of insanity.  You rock.

God put DonTrump on this earth
To teach Humanity a lesson
One of the things He did
Was send @KamalaHarris
To grill Jeff B. Sessions

w/love
How dare that old fraud McCain interrupt... he's not even on the comittee . The whole performance made me vomit
I DO declaaaare!
@adamslily @StephenAtHome The very term "hysteria" originates in misogyny. It's a female attribute from a  patriarchal era.
Watch the video & the part where Jason Miller refers to Kamala Harris as hysterical.This #nastywoman is pissed & highly offended.
She has big ovaries and we need more ovaries in DC.
This is too great!
Please throwing those verbs, attacking with nouns and dangling those nasty participles!
Thank-you for your service.
Go get em Senator Harris.
And we love you for it 
I loved it, keep hamming on the crooked GOP repuks!
We love the job you're doing. Keep the heat up and the pressure on.
No one does it like Stephen Colbert !!!
well done to Kamala Harris. There are more questions for sure.
This gave me life  . . those participles be on point 
.But not your Oxford comma. And I thought you were perfect. Sigh.
And, you certainly have principles.
I <3 this bit so hard.
This is brilliant, instant classic, right on the money Stephen Colbert.

Ta for sharing Senator @KamalaHarris ^_^
Ms. Harris, UR  gorgeous; U had Mr. Keebler mumbling cause he could get his eyes of you. You made him nervous. It's all plausible. Slap Him!
And we love you!!
This!!!!!!!!!   Yes......
Expecting great things from you.
You are making us proud @SenKamalaHarris
He said "Beauregard" & "fainting couch" in the same sentence! Only you could cause that Sen. Harris! Lol!
Slay
Stay Nasty, Kamala!
You gave him the opportunity to answer–he didn't take it. Don't know how you keep your cool in face of the obstructionism and misogyny.
Senator Harris, you were spot on!  Colbert was hysterical!  Lol
.....a fainting couch and a mint julep........is it any wonder we  @StephenAtHome !!
Ok, I'll be one of the participles•
Goatee host organism!?!?
That lady was very rude interrupting him every time he answered.
No love for the Oxford comma? 
Eloquent and powerful.  THANK YOU.
When women are aggressive in business or politics, they are considered hysterical or bitchy. #doublestandard
cereal mom?  I thought you were AKA.    Question: When questioned in Senate is one allowed to clarify? I thought it was yes or no.
Senator, we are so proud of you!
Lololololol. Very entertaining. Keep them in their toes, Sen Harris!
Bravo both of you 
Brilliant
I luv this lol
Turns out girls do have good language skills, fast too, apparently
ONE THING:
One thing that you should know about Kamala Harris is. Never Underestimate a Howard Girl.

Hope you set your sights on the top seat in 2020! Happy to support you! @SenKamalaHarris @KamalaHarris
Kamala, you heard it from Sessions own lips, u make him nervous & I'm sure many othr GOP too. Kamala for POTUS 2020  http://TSanMisc.com 
Well done, Senator Harris! So glad you represent us and represent us exceptionally well!
We love asking tough questions 
Senator Harris, you have the backbone so many of the other senators lack.
Please run for 46. America will need a smart, tough president to clean-up 45's mess.
Old white misogynistic men still controlling politics and look at the mess we are in. Time for women to fix our problems home and abroad!
Sure wish you would move to MT so I could vote for you!
Obvious #SessionsHearing was running the clock down on all #Dem Senators with his nonsensical word salad shame on @SenJohnMcCain #Resist
Kamala you are so self righteous
You were superb!!
Don't forget your modifiers. Misplaced or not, you can't talk to Rs without a few well-selected modifiers.
#SenWonderWoman
...even though you can't use them correctly. STOP being a whiny child talking over others.
Thank you for doing your job on the committee,Sen.Harris.
Are you going to amend-a-rama to stop the AHCA?
Jason Miller: When women ask tough questions and demand answers, that is not "hysteria" but DETERMINATION.
To help you avoid such silly mistakes in the future, imagine you were evaluating the behavior of a male Republican.
 @realDonaldTrump is a hysterical whining little B. #TrumpRussia #MoveToMoscow #PutinsPuppet #TraitorTrump #LockHimUp #ConArtist #Resist
Keep asking the hard questions so we can uncover "Putin & the Grits!" #resist #Persist #nastywoman #BrilliantWoman
What an idiot, american comediens have so far AWAY from comedy it isnt even funny. Yea, think about that.....
ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON!    She Persisted!!!  
You gave Sessions "the vapors". I'm dying of giggles *thud*
He is not right as you too, and very disrespectful to American's
Love that you're making your mark in D.C. already!
i love it!!! that accent is great
Go, Senator Harris, go! Apparently Colbert is as big a fan of yours as I am. I just love it when you make the GOP nervous.
The far left has started smearing her, too, proving their misogyny in 2017 was not a one off.
@SenKamalaHarris great job!
This gave me life!
Too funny! 
Keep up the great work Sen Harris! 
I love it when these men are so frightened by such a brilliant strong woman.
You're the woman Senator Harris!
Most normal folk do!  LOL!
These old white, sexist men have just assured @SenKamalaHarris 's rising star. Thank you sirs.
I'm beyond impressed and proud of my Senator! You rock, and keep on making that old white man nervous...
And we love you, you are an American hero 
We  u
i love that you watch @StephenAtHome 
he's my fave!
and so are you madam!
stay strong sister!
I love Kamala Harris. My wife calls you the real Wonder Woman
I love you you make my day @StephenAtHome
You're also one of the rudest people in Congress.

Grammar nerds unite!
That was awesome! Thank you @SenKamalaHarris  and @StephenAtHome for laying it all out there. Truth!
Stephen Colbert is a vile little man. & U seek to associate with more hatred of our ELECTED PRESIDENT U seek to impeach with Zero STATUES
Thank you senator Harris. You were calm and collected. Much appreciated your example. 
Has the goatee host organism apologized to you yet?
A preposition is nice on occasion.
That was funtastic.  #TGIF #FridayFeeling  #Resist
Don't be dangling your participles out like some kinda Dirk Digglin' unbuckler of syntax, I do declare!
Yeah Kamala! Thank you !
Kamala did great. Sessions obvsly didn't want to answer - he did meet w/ Kislyak. McCain, Burr shut you down to cover up. Shame on them all!
And we love you!
It's ok. With @FLOTUS and @IvankaTrump we have enough adjectives floating around to make us all nauseated and dizzy  from the fluff
NOW THAT WAS HYSTERICAL!!!
Obvious technique Sessions uses to chew up the clock. Something an ex-senator would be hip to.
that Only Russian/Rushing line though lol I will sit bk this am & enjoy watching the TrumpBus roll over good ol Rod n Jeff n sip mint juleps
Take him down. We will no longer allow the good old boys to run us into the ground. #PowerToThePeople
How about Kamala for Prez in 2020?  I love it   With Susan Rice for VP  I love it.
Impressive work, please keep the foot on the gas. Country before party!
You also love your PRINCIPLES. 
All the best,
A GRATEFUL NATION
A fainting couch and a mint julep 
Great job Kamala! Keep up the heat !

Hysterical r u freaking kidding me? shut the front door......@SenKamalaHarris had poise and the kind of respect gained only by character!!
Jason Miller is a jackass.
PLEASE don't stop. you are awesome and it shines all the way over here in South Africa. (and as a man apologies. sincerely.)
The English language is a great weapon to have!  Keep up the good fight!
I think you should go on Colbert
