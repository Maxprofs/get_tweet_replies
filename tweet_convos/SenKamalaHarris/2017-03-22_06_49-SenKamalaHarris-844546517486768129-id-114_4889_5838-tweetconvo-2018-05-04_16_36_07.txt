please push for @Rep_DevinNunes to step down after his actions today! #stepdown
my congressman has no voicemail and doesn't pick up the phone. Rohrabacher in Orange County.
5 million don't want coverage, 6 million don't want Medicare, that's the 11 million who won't have coverage. You fool.
thank you for fighting for us!
nothing to worry about now. Maybe our side can just tweak it now as with any health plan over time.
@mgyllenhaal kicking people not contributing off their free healthcare.Everyone will have access to healthcare #responsible
, I hope Dems show some guts for ones and vote no on Gorsuch nomination, otherwise it will be a big win for McConnell!
and are also going to kick health care off their health care.
Dear Rookie: "Better to be thought a fool and remain silent, then to speak and remove all doubt," take Mark Twain's advice.
Govnmt needs to be OUT of my Drs office. Downsize the Beast. ObamaCare will implode then what will mils do? #KillTheBill
Thank you for sharing this number! We must get involved with our own future!
how can I help you get these horrible bills removed from the voting process.

he did nothing illegal.yall really need to pull your big person pants on.stop trashing on us the people.
@chtemplin I did call mine
NO DEALS Dems!
ins companies CANNOT put a cap on coverage!!!
They shld take 'health care' out of their death bill & just do strait up tax cuts 4 1% all it is @SenKamalaHarris @mgyllenhaal
Propaganda & Lies
Reminder: 16 million people were kicked off their health plans when the ACA was enacted.

Encourage hold on Gorsuch hearings until FBI investigation is finished. Trump may have less than 11 months left in office.
please vote no on Gorsuch.
do away with taxes altogether since its theft.make weed legal and tax it.learn from colorado and washington.
No one was kicking anyone off anything.  It was to give people a choice.  Something Dems appear not to like!
No one is being kicked off health care. Vote yes. Get it done.
I never got my deductible lowered by $2500.  Democrats lie.
call
@chel_c_cam I see you are RT my homegirl. 
I'm sleeping well tonight.... the Russians are going to take care of us
phone calls and emails work, tweets not so much
Thank you for your service Kamala.
@PatrickRothfuss who pays for their health care?
Unfortunately, Rep. Royce doesn't appear to care enough to answer the phone.
@momofstan WWJD????
@elabar5 - I called today, hope everyone does
& yes I am pulling all of my retirement savings out of the stock market. Prepare for the next GREAT dtrumph recession
I will not be calling. People need to face the consequences of their voting and their note voting

Busy signal. Go figure.
But when you will speak?
so I called my rep. Steve Pearce of NM but BIG SURPRISE, he's not taking calls at this time and mailbox is full. Really??!!
Keep calling. #NMProud
I generally do not contact my Senators or Representatives unless I disagree with them.
I am 100% certain that Adam Schiff is a "no", Senator.
@MixedPancake Republicans, Kamala
tried to call @SenSchumer @SenGillibrand but lines engaged.  #AHCA is #death  sentence and financial disaster. @SenWarren
@HalfOnionInABag thanks for the reminder
and say what exactly?
THATS....   It gives millions of ppl the CHOICE to buy ACA instead of being FORCED to buy it!
Done.  Thank u 4 the reminder. Rep Bill Johnson from Ohio received my message.  Everyone do this!  So important n so easy!
Iâ€™ve tweeted my congressman to vote No! But @RepJeffDenham is owned by Ryan & Trump and will do  their bidding, not ours.
.@SenKamalaHarris .@aimeemann ok enough with the bullshit libs
thanks for fighting for us Senator Harris! Your constituents at Indivisible SF support you.
The Republican Insurance Plan, aka RIP.
how do we find out direct numbers for our state
@HalfOnionInABag Left VM message and tweeted @RepLanceNJ7 - re VOTE NO on ACHA.
how will you convince the lawmakers from your state to vote "No"?
thanks for the number my Rep assistant answered and he's voting NO !
GOP is trying to turn healthcare into WEALTHCARE.
@Mistress_Bliss well this is going to cause civil war 2.... what a country.
@PattersonScott2 You can help make a change!  Call the #...I did!  
@HalfOnionInABag on it...
@HalfOnionInABag why doesn't twitter allow link to phone numbers ?
@HalfOnionInABag all lines are busy..... I'll email instead!  But I won't back down 
It's amazing what the governors of a nation can do to get money from poor families and keep it
@HalfOnionInABag my representative @RepChrisCollins does not represent my area. He's out for himself only.
ON it
@aimeemann anyone in Washington have a better idea?
Consider it done.  Thank you for all you're doing.
@HalfOnionInABag my reps office laughed at me for asking them to vote against it.
You're off by about eight years - that bill already passed (with only Dem votes) and was signed by Obama.
I am counting on you to stop it too
exactly what aca did,  now you have a problem with it
@SenSanders @SenWarren @MaxineWaters PLEASE FIGHT TO KEEP THIS FROM HAPPENING.
@DanaRohrabacher is a lost cause. No point in calling. Just going to work and give $$$$ to opponent in 18
yes. We will all sorely miss the $15,000 deductible and the $15,000 annual enrollment fee. Not
The phone answering staff at my MD offices seem frustrated + somewhat cynical. Claim 900-1500 calls/day.
#also #SCOTUS unanimously overruled #NeilGorsuch #Today. #Huge message. #share #GorsuchHearing
we did!! And shocked our Rep actually answered the phone! Walter Jones (R-NC) will vote nay!
Will do.
@ikebarinholtz they don't give a shit abt us. Marches, phone calls, letters, begging, crying and/or dying.It's never abt us
Up to $4,000 in REFUNDABLE tax credits buys infinitely more healthcare than an ACA HDHP with a huge deductible.
@womensmarchwccc Once implementation begins then people will begin to die within 72 hours without certain medications.
CA state legs are introducing a bill to remove felony charges for knowingly spreading HIV. You lost all credibility re: HC
Done and done. Fingers crossed!

I call daily but not holding out much hope that it will work when a bully POTUS threatens them all.
@DanaRohrabacher is a lost cause. We just need to make sure he's gone in 18
@chicagotribune @nytimes Congress crafting their own golden healthcare parachute-HR307-as they prep to cut services for others. Hypocrisy.
