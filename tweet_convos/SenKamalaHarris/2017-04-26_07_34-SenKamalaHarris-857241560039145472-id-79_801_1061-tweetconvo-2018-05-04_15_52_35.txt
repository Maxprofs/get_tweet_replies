Why didn't you prosecute Mnuchin when you were CA Atty Gen?
What? You are so full of it.
The Republiscums give no F*cks!

GOP = Greed Over People.
We've got to get these people out of there. What has happened to basic decency?
The dishonest capitalist vultures of Koch Summit cabal (2010 n/w $130B): Kochs, Popes, DeVos', Mercers, AFP, FreedomWorks, Cato, Heritage...
This TELLS EVERYONE that their "plan" is  NOT ACCEPTABLE.  #GOP #wethepeople will remember come voting day
Have you wondered about the fate of millions who have  $ 12K deductible and $ 600 in the bank . ??? It's free for u.
that's the 21st century @GOP courtesy of @SenateMajLdr and @SpeakerRyan
As a gesture of "great" leadership, cldn't #45 pay all the requisite premiums personally; or perhaps cancel the odd w/end away to fund?
What do Republican supporters think of this?  "Pass the taters please" ?
Sweetie. Correct me if I am wrong, but aren't you exempt from Obamacare?
And why not, they sold themselves to the Russians, so who cares about those pesky little constituents?? @DNC @dccc @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer
Healthcare is a right, not a privilege. Anyone with common sense knows that.
Trump's trailer trash supporters will be so happy .
You think America is so stupid that they don't remember YOU Democrats sponsored Obamacare which Congress was exempt from. Demos lie everyday
Wondering why @SenKamalaHarris still has a law license. "Prejury" aka a damn crook and liar!
The GOP are so delusional and a bunch of hypocrites. They think everyone are so gullible and uneducated like a lot of trump supporters
Sowing hatred and class warfare is what
will be the death of your socialist dreams, Sis.
We don't need another politician who divides us.
They don't care what we think.
No, typical
Couldn't be any worse then having your premiums triple , losing my doctor, deductible double, coverage drop to 80% from100 I welcome new rip
We shouldn't allow this!!! They're animals.
If the health care is not good enough Congress than its not good enough for the people. They work for us!!
They have no shame left do they?
Americans voted 4 ACA repeal on 11/8. We can't afford exorbitant premiums any longer. Repeal will exempt all of us #KamalaSteepLearningCurve
Weird, Dems did same thing with ACA. Now they speak up?  Hypocrites.
Obviously, they're cowards and elitists. Not a leader among them.
More pathetic: You're not stopping them.  #Fail #Resist #ImpeachTrump
#SinglePayer...or don't touch the system at all!
Well, government is now all about them don't you know. Middle class needs to speak up and VOTE for someone who helps them!
Can we stop this senHarris?
Medicare for ALL congress too
Evil
You want to keep ACA but you are exempted from it. Either way the Washington elites will coerce and impose but exempt themselves. I call BS!
Thank you for continuing to stand up for our rights on healthcare. My daughter has three pre-existing conditions. #resist
So sad! Keep up the good fight, Senator  Harris. We are supporting your efforts to keep these people in check!
The GOP leaders are hypocrites! The American people guarded by wolves led by @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr.
Sen. Harris, why not introduce a bill that Congress must use the healthcare plan that they pass? I appreciate your work very much! #resist
My disgust with them knows no bounds! Yecch!
Thank you for fighting for what is right for your constituents. Those who don't appreciate you now will when they realize what is happening.
We should be seeing all in #Congress that know this shouting it from every channel.
But it was OK when  libs exempted themselves
The GOP has the numbers to pillage and plunder, yet thanks for trying.
Hypocrites and liars-wish I could vote against all of them! I will, tho', vote out the ones I can. Ridiculous & greedy & unconstitutional.
LIAR
You weren't a senator last time but look it up..this was also done under Obama care, for BOTH sides. Don't make it out like its only repubs.
How can we support you as you work to block this?
Plan? At this point we should just call what Republians, Russians, Nazis, Skinheads, KKK & KKK-spin-offs are doing, what it is: 'plotting."
These Republicans are not the Republicans of Ronald Reagan. Reagan would never sell America out to the Russians.
No, but he sold us to the cartels, defense corps, international creditors, & religious right. Go back to Ike/Lincoln for a decent GOP prez.
I do see your point. I should have said that as bad as Reagan was, he would not have tolerated this.

"Populists" take note.
They're making it so easy to vote them out of office.
Thanks for the heads up, not surprised
At the end of the day; Republicans only care about money and themselves. It really is shameful and they should not be re-elected
when the russians come for you Im going to look the other way and laugh the same as you did when they came for me.
?
the russians who worked for trump and sanders. Only when they come for kam it wont be on the internet.
