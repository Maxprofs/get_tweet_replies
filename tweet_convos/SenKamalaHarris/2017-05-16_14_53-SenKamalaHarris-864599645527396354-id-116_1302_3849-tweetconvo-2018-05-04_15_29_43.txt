That's a good idea. Only about 8 years late
Don't hold your breath. @gop circa 2017 is the most corrupt, unpatriotic evil hate group in history
Thanks for doing your part @SenKamalaHarris Please keep up the pressure to get your colleagues to DO THE RIGHT THING! #timetopackupthecircus
Should always be
YES, thank you. Go down in history as having the courage to be part of the solution, NOT complacent & hiding the high crimes & misdemeanors.
Shut up. You are part of Obama's Deep State. WE know the real enemies to America, Democrats and their puppet media.
@GOP @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump sad 2 say they may never step up! The GOP want 2 bleed him dry of everything they can get! They gonna ride
Trump till the wheels fall off! Meanwhile Americans grow more angry & frustrated with this circus! They a playing with our future & lives!
18 more months...till midterms
We shouldn't have 2 wait that long! There should b emergency special election of all GOP seats!Some GOP r being investigated 4 insider trade
And democratic seats, don't be bipartisan, Americans need to hold them all accountable dammit
Ur very right!But it's partisan not bipartisan!Bipartisan means Dems&GOP. Partisan means having favor toward 1 party!Sorry 4 the correction
Thank you, I write fast when angry, its late, should have been off hours ago.
No prob, I do it 2 ! Lol have a good night
Agree, partly.  Time to implement voter ID laws & polygraphs for public office.
Won't happen.  GOP mantra:  "We hate everyone and want to party like it's 1955"
Lololol. Dems are party of criminals hypocrites and atheists. The "ignorant!" bullshit would NEVER choose hell!
or give enough shits about your party to give Trump the boot so there might be something left of it to salvage #TheEndofGOP
"Hold this White House accountable?" Seems like SOMEBODY has prejudged the situation.
Absolutely!
Oh, like the way you always put party over state in California?
History will hold both Trump and the GOP accountable for running American democracy into the ground.
Don't hold your breath. Republicans are traitors too. They're only interested in enriching themselves & pushing Christian Sharia Law on us
Yea, when have you ever been bipartisan ever in your political career?
they were all duped.he gets impched, takes the money from Russia n China, goes back to his day job
Na. They won't.
How long before impeachment can begin? Are you leading Senator or following?
I'm hopeful but not sanguine. Nice doublespeak eh?
Excuse me,but when did the Democrats start putting country before party. With Obama, there was never any accountability
For goodness sake let's stand up!!
@realDonaldTrump is a threat to our National Security and should be stopped from taking this trip.
#stophistrip
Where were the dems when B.O. abandoned Americans who were killed in Benghazi,when Clinton divulged classified info, silence was deafening?
Patriotism means to stand by the country. It does not mean to stand by the president... Teddy  Roosevelt
 This is about our country, obstructing justice, treason, collusion and $ laundering. @realDonaldTrump should be 
#ImpeachTrump
Yes, but they simply sit back and allow 45 to do whatever he wants to do...more like the Apprentice than a POTUS...NEEDS CONSEQUENCES ,
Please run for higher office! We need you to work for more than just California!
The GOP has to join the Democrats it is in the nations best interest
GOP will be on board for accountability after they have everything they want.
To everyone responding here: it's fine to be skeptical. Understand your cynicism. But don't succumb. If Repubs represent you, call them now.
yes, enough is enough! Impeach now!
#ResistDemocrats
They won't
You're just going to get ripped on twitter @SenKamalaHarris , American people are pissed off. Just go do your damn job
Accountable for what? What crime has Trump committed?
Red white and blue the colors that represents our flag our land are they patriotic enough to protect this nation or faithful at party $$
And yet, they are not, nor, are the democrats. None of you have the gonads to do your jobs. Stand up or get out ppls 
@SenKamalaHarris yes we (citizens agree) country over party.  but do your peers know that?
Guy across the street from me has had an American flag for at least sixteen years. Now, a Trump flag flies there. Party over country now.
This is such a sad statement. How on earth can someone choose this (awful, horrible, no good) person over their country?
I live in a part of Maryland filled with Confederate flags. It's a badge of honor to him.
The truth of the matter is one of the two: they are colluded with him or they are afraid. GOP oversee all what they do during campaign&after
When do the democrats ever put the country over party?
YES!
Our democracy is at stake! Why don't the GOP just go to Arlington National and piss on graves and call it a day!
This is BS - GOP has been putting country ahead of party for last 8 years - where have I been? @gop @MIGOP @vp @SpeakerRyan
You're right. Problem is you need the Republicans to stop jerking each other off and participate. DNC should have supported Bernie huh?
Senator, you're new, but you'll learn. The guys across the aisle have no integrity.
Wth all due respect, Senator. NO FUCKING SHIT.
#ResistDemocrats
What hypocrisy Schumer & his lackeys including U R guilty of very thing U accuse the WH of Time 2 B an adult & end ruinous scorched earth!!
Where the hell were you Democrats for the last 8 years?
Apparently, you are going to be able to tweet these same two sentences every day. He keeps being a disaster & the GOP keeps covering for him
Good luck with that. Today's Republicans are the updated version of Vichy France. McConnell is their Petain
Ha ha ha.

It ius becoming a tsunami of facts that Trump is a fraud of the highest order leaving him no where else to hide
.@SenKamalaHarris 2020.  I'm all in.
@GOP is terrified of losing Trump base. So they will do nothing until the polls convince them it will be painless. Until then, treason ahoy!
Thank you for standing up for democracy ! I appreciate all your hard work!
GoP: Weeeeelll, maybe but can we pass a huge tax cut and wreck Obamacare first though?
Your narrative is garbage.  Pound sand, harpie.
Good luck with that. They are as spineless and hypocritical as the day is long.
Unfortunately reps have waited 8 yrs to get back n power & want to overturn all president Obama did. They're not going give up so easily
How can Republican leadership join you?
The are complicit.
They can't do that. Their handlers won't allow it.
Agreed. How do we get them to do that?
I feel like you just post the same thing everyday...this is truly sad #ImpeachTrump
She does, they all do. Talk,Talk,Talk. That's what the American taxpayers pay for
But will they? So far, all signs point to no.
They're not gonna.
I guess Kamala Harris has nothing else to do but tweet, #overpaidprincess
Impeachment now. How much more has to happen? @HouseGOP r enabling this circus, they need to be thrown out. Do not trust anything they say.
Thank you from Kelseyville, CA!
What did trump do to you
Crickets.
Start impeachment proceedings NOW
you're right but I needed a good laugh today
You have said over again this cannot  be a bipartisan congress, to accomplish matters; correct there must be bipartisanship throughout......
Sen. Kamala Harris of CALIFORNIA; Thank You! Wholeheartedly I can see you clearly (enough). TRUTH
Don't hold your breath, Senator. This GOP is morally bankrupt, & all about party over country.
You can’t approve any appointment, bills or anything from anyone related to Trump administration
#ResistDemocrats
Join republicans? No, this is the perfect opportunity to attack the Republican Party for their onslaught of terrible decisions
It's time to start drafting articles of #impeachment
Exactly why we need @VoteRobertOwen in @CA23rd ca2. #Trumprussia
Agreed. #Impeach Trump
Impeach.
Regardless, we are putting democrats back to the house in 2018 to hold this white house accountable. #ImpeachTrump
If they don't still have all the voting machines rigged.
The party of this man:
They won't. They never will.
Don't hold your breath. The current GOP reps in congress are among the most craven, ignorant and stupidly stuborn politicians in US history.
They do not have the stamina or guts! @jaketapper
Yeah good luck with that the clown car will stay together
There have been those moments on a daily basis. So far, crickets!
SPOILER: They won't.
#ResistDemocrats
Thank you and keep swinging! #Trumprussia #Impeachnow
I love you, Ms. Harris, but please do not hold your breath.
Accountable for what exactly???
You seem to be enjoying the effect
Thank you #CountryOverParty
IMPEACH HIM JAIL HIM LIAR LIAR IMPEACH HIM JAIL HIM #russianpuppet #crookedtrump @GOP @PRyan !! #resist #indivisible
How exactly, Senator Harris?
