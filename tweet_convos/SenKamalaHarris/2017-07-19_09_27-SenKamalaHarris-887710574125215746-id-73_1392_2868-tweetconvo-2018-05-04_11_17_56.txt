Let it die on @DNC @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems hands 

Vote your #criminal party home or prison or institution they are all nut cases

Schiz! Schnoz schoose!! $$$$$
Harris/Kennedy 2020!
There is no mercy in allowing the Government to dictate to its citizens the manner in which they take care of themselves.#FullRepeal
Kamala is always fight fight fighting. D's the party of no. Elections have consequences. Trump has a mandate from people.
Want U 2 hear my voice too! Why can't citizens have same coverage as Congress since we pay for it? Simple application of economy of scales.

 Let's continue 2 retweet this until they give us what we want & need.  Politicians elected by the voters & not lobbyist. 
How do we go after govt sabotage of ACA? Can Congress do anything about it? Anything specific we can call abt and ask for?
Keep you reps phones tied up.  Call friends in other states! Especially in states with mid-term elections.  Ask how they are leaning. 1/
As the criminals yell the ppl suffer
You're right! #FullRepeal #FullRepeal #FullRepeal  #FullRepeal #FullRepeal #FullRepeal #FullRepeal #FullRepeal #FullRepeal

 REPS & MEET with them.
Let's enhance #ACA
Share your experiences in replies…
I've had a complete change in trust & respect for President Trump. I've made a great mistake in believing in Trumps business ethics
Here's my voice - how does "President Harris"sound? 
ill stop resisting the corp dem agenda when they start fighting for me & not the ins companies! #SinglePayer NOW!
C'mon Senator, isn't it time for a #NationalStrike ?  What do you say, RT?
@wendyphd @SenKamalaHarris is my girl crush
For good reason!  
Amen!!
Harris 2020!
https://goo.gl/liKUTy   Pour une statue de vous, vous préférez le marbre, la pierre ou des harengs?

No Repeal  /then replace by REPS & DEMS vote .  failed 2X ? Keep common core  affordable Care act.& Medicare established 1965. More -SOS%
@RepBarbaraLee @SenatorBoxer @JerryBrownGov How Long before we are answering to PUTIN! This is BEYOND RIDICULOUS! #SAD
I lost my healthcare today because Trump is CAUSING ObamaCare to fail. He refuses to commit to paying insurers government subsidies.
It was failing for years before he got elected, it just finally caught up to you. Sorry about that, but its true.
Kamala 2020!!
Yes by all means let us continue the entitlements dictator Obama provided the people!  Keep ur doctor, lower premiums, ALL LIES!
We have only just begun.....got lot's of fight left in us..
CBO is devastating. Premiums are punitive and prohibitive.
OBOMBACARE is dead Kampala better get ass going cause she just whines no new plan ideas  cause democRATS are just whiners no workers!  Haha
Per 2020, I'd love to see you lead the way on Trump Russia commentary.
Let's work on #MedicareForAll!
Isn't Obamacare basically just an insurance product "Made in America?"

How can they try to ruin it this week, of all weeks?
All th leftists want Commie Care
Hmmm...should we wait on Time Warner and 21st C. Fox, though?
Absolutely
Right on. Vote Against the GOP 2018,2020
We know those assholes don't give a crap @SenateMajLdr
ABSOLUTELY
stay vigilant Senator! letting something fail is Trumps forte ;)
Is it possible for Dems to draft an alternate bill & get CBO score? See if there is public support for it? #ExpandACA #ExpandMedicaid
Immoral TrumpCare Bill. Take from poor, give to Rich.
@SenatorCollins @SenCapito @lisamurkowski @senrobportman @SenDeanHeller #trumprussia
Dems need to be proactive not reactive.  Our democracy is diseased. The roots of the disease r exposed.  We must eradicate it n move forward
Agreed! Nothing is truly ever "dead" and we must keep fighting
It's not won until the US has single payer
Stop sessions over reach with the assets forfeiture laws that he is trying to force down our throats legalized robbery by police departments
Agreed. Need a full repeal and return to free markets!
I agree, we must push daily for change, we must remove Trump, we MUST get those (whom we all know) to vote! (http://xtradonaire.wordpress.com ).
Senator, please don't rest on health care. #SinglePayer is what America needs & you should be advocating loudly for it. #Medicare4All
amen
REPEAL Obamacare
Nd to change the pressure to strengthening ACA. 45 chips away at it w confidence eroding decisions to make insurance providers back away.
But Trump is just leaving Obamacare intact. Now that legislation's failure is his? Huh?
Thank you so much for your relentless opposition to trumpcare!
Medicare for all; including politicians.
"Single Payer"...Next step Senator!
I win you lose haha
TY Sen. Harris! Please keep fighting for Californians!
#HealthcareBill
Thank you for fighting so hard
We are with you!
That's what this "death" lunch is all about, right Mob Boss @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @SenJohnMcCain @JohnCornyn @ChuckGrassley

Remember Healthcare is the number one human right of all human rights.
Whoever uses health insurance as a way of making money is immoral…
Thank you Senator! Keep up your Excellent work on our behalf and please do continue thinking about a run for president! You have my vote!
And if they can't fleece Americans in the health care bill, by God they will do it in the #GOPBudget. Medicaid takes a huge hit.
Make the political case for socialised universal healthcare
And thanks for all you do Kamala!
Your office is on my next to call list
How/When do we know the fight has been won?
When the US has universal healthcare like every other wealthy nation
Single payer! We don't need insurers whose economic incentive is to not pay for service, whose only accountability is to shareholders.
Very true. #KeepKidsCovered @AmerAcadPeds
