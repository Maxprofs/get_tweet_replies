This is Hillary Clinton's website rephrased. I liked it then, I like it now. But let's not pretend she didn't have this all outlined.
Kamala Harris is a career prosecutor. She would make a fine establishment candidate if you want the left to start a third party.
A lot of us Bernie voters also like Kamala. It's either your way or the highway. This will guarantee another Trump/R win in 2018 & 2020.
So you don't think Stop Mass Incarceration is important?
Of course, that's important. The whole criminal justice system needs to be overhauled. Systemic racism has to be rooted out.
Are you familiar with the concept career prosecutors play in the system?
Of course. Are you trying to insult my intelligence? Just because she was a prosecutor doesn't mean she supports mass incarceration.
True or false. She is a career criminal prosecutor who mass incarcerated people.
It's time for CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM! Without it, the people will never get anything even resembling #ABetterDeal, and you know it.

"We Work For America" Gotta get America in there, get a slogan that means special interests are out. Follow w/ "We Work For You" 1/
Get in front of the GoldmanSachs invasion of the WH which is forgetting the forgotten ppl. Give 'em a New Deal history lesson "party of FDR"
I hate bumper sticker slogans but you need them because many will not think past the slogan.
How's about you start with the Democratic Party;
You're my Senator, and I'm telling you, this BernieSanders platform doesn't cut it for me. Where's the #VRA? Where's the support for women?
This is an op-ed, not a platform. 
Except mine, since we support Trump. You'd prefer to shoot us.
@TYKAMALA!! @GOPTAXBILLDOESNTCONSIDERWORKINGCLASS
@WEARELISTENING2THETRUTH
The word "deal" is so associated with DJT - not sure why Dems would pick this slogan.  From a lifelong dem - poor mkt research.
Typical neo liberal rhetoric sound like a progressive, get in the white house and move to the center.
DNC will not win over Americans if they continue to embrace their corporate pasts. Only makes them GOP Version 2.0
#ABetterDeal? 
So you're saying Obama failed for 8 years???
Wow ! Finally ! You love our President Trump ! Great !
Oh I know!! I know !! Democrats need a stronger reality based slogan !!! How about
This slogan is bad. Wheeling and dealing is Trump's thing. Stop doing things on his terms and with his language. Stop being reactionary.
Ditch the slogan. It's trite.
U want a better deal for illegals & welfare cases. What do u know about "Am families"?
A better deal? Are buying a used car or a pizza? Is that all we care about now...making deals?
Senator I want you for prez in 2020 but this "Better Deal" has to go! Needs a new name #kamalaharris2020
We don’t need slogans, we need action on single payer healthcare and resistance to #Trumps agenda.
How about you start with AFairDeal for all the inmates you left behind?
It’s time for #ABetterDeal for American families. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/24/opinion/chuck-schumer-employment-democrats.html …
After 8yrs of "hope and change" somehow "a better deal" sounds a lot like turd polishing. No thanks.
Also where do you stand on Congressman Conyers bill. HR-40. Commission to study and develop reparation proposals for African Americans act
Reparation now for African Americans. I'm tried of falling through the crack and being ignored.
And honestly the nod to the New Deal will go over a lot of people's heads. Shouldn't we have a platform before coming up w/ a catchy slogan?
New Democrat Party Seal
A better deal would be a real Senator in California, not one who slept their way to a position of "authority". #NotMySenator #ABetterDeal
Says the hypocrite who supports a flotus who has pics of her cooch all over the internet.
Typical leftist response to blame Trump instead of your terrible policies which hold people down. You are the true party of slavery!
Please keep up the good work!
Time to throw away the old rhetoric. Time for new Bill of Rights. Right of HC, living wage, education, equality of race, religion, gender
Read the comprehensive Study by the Pugo Committee (1918), on how concentration of control over money and credit impacts the economy
St Louis Fed has a full copy on its website or you can get it from LexisNexis.
I hope you won't call it a " better deal" how about a "great deal" a " people's deal" a citizen's deal, "deal for the working class"
You should use a team like the one FDR commissioned for New Deal: an economist, a lawyer, and a historian/political scientist
I think regulating antitrust and lowering prescription drug prices are worthy efforts but not immediate and compelling enough 4 most people
8 years of Obama and Hilary. Why would we believe now it will be a better deal. Like Obamacare Biden said Big f____ deal. LOL
BULL S____
Country needs more than #ABetterDeal. Need #AFutureToBelieveIn... #FightFor15 #BlackLivesMatter #SinglePayer #MedicareForAll @TheDemocrats
Did you hear Dean Heller on MSNBC this morning come up with the new Demo slogan? 

"Trump takes the fun out of disfunctional"
Thank you
Change the slogan not gonna work.
"for the people"
That's what we want to hear, less for #HighFinance more for working families and the poor. Period.
#ABetterDeal deal for who the @DNC ? No thanks we're all set we got @realDonaldTrump he the best deal for AMERICANS!
So lets start articulating it, what is a better deal for American families? Not CEO's on Wall St. hoarding the economy for themselves
A year late, but sure. #Democrats  @WaPoExpress
This is what need more of....plans, ideas. hope for the future. Dems, Speak abt good stuff!
NEVER VOTE for Republicans again.
I'm still for #Hillary2020 ..the election was stolen from her & I don't appreciate @SenSchumer bashing her..try coming up with your own deal
Folks who's priorities was the economy voted for Hillary. Trump won on cultural issues-- race, Mexican immigration, Muslims, etc
Hating @SenSchumer right now. But my RT is for your, @SenKamalaHarris
Nah not with the bros Chuck and Bernie. Please stand with the Resistance instead.
Yes~

#loser
Dem policies haven't really changed in 40 years, so if people don't know, then that's their problem. Just find a better way to reach people.
I'm in favor of what you're doing - ACA is better than the GOP "alternative," but #ABetterDeal sounds like you support theirs.
Donars in the Hamptons dont need #ABetterDeal  Support a #PeoplesPlatform or be voted out.  https://summerforprogress.com/platform 
Please Stop this Coup
All "fluff" no action.  Corporate Dems need to look at "People's Platform"!
That's for making economy worse
You are a lousy lawyer , now you are an economist . Yahoo already slammed your plan . 7 mos and you present this crap bill
The Democrats are the self-proclaimed party of youth and new ideas. Here are their illustrious party leaders...good luck!
I guess you didn't test that stupid slogan well enough
I think your creative team needs to be fired.
Let's follow the #Democrats over the cliff....
Figures, #Democrats have to steal other people's ideas
Screw your better deal...too little, too late! You're now trying to take over #MAGA? Keep going you wannabe President.
#ABetterDeal should include constitutional amendments 4 voting protection, popular vote 4 prez, auto voter reg, Nat Saturday Vote not Tues!
#ABetterDeal should include constitutional amendments to set in law norms & traditions 4 prez. No family in WH, Release All Taxes & more!
Not Americans but American families. Coming all the way down from the wealthiest party of Bezos to Zuck to Hollywood - still no imagination
Even Kamala knows @POTUS44 was a phony. It takes one to know one
It is time for the Dem Establishment to wake up to the fact that Dems are losing people right and left.  #NoCorporateDems #GetOffTheTake
Should have had a better deal when Obama was pres.Instead democrats screwed the American people out of everything
You Democrats are going to lose you have no message. Wake up. I'm only voting for Bernie he has a message
What??  1%? There a lot more issues to deal with in this world that will effect this country. He is clueless!!
What a bunch or nothing, grasping at straws and using parts of someone elses words
Notice the life preserver for refugees they want to flood  with. Cause thats working so well for Europe.
Ur a joke Demorats have no leadership or dealership
Is this what you came up w/at your fundraising in the Hamptons? Real American problems, aren't in the Hamptons. #TryAgain #DEMFAIL
*yawn* It's time for univ. health care, committing to 100% renewable energy, rebuilding public infrastructure, and ending neocolonial wars.
From hope and change, to a better deal. Both= no substance.
 Only we American workers know it's just another lie.  I'll stick with President Trump in 2020!
This is the progressive idea of a better deal, total govt control
A better deal?? Fr hahah!! You all are the same as Republicans. You just kill us slower #LetDemsLose #LetRepsLose #LetBothPartiesBurn #Ash
HAHAHAHA WE VOTED TRUMP FOR A BETTER DEAL AFTER 8 HORRIBLE YEARS OF OBAMA! SHIT JOBS, UNDEREMPLOYMENT & NO ECONOMIC GROWTH! DEMS SUCK! #maga
Democrats and #ABetterDeal Here's The BEST DEAL EVER TERM LIMITS 
8 YEARS under Obama, and it wasn't time *then*??  Wow...
Higher taxes for working white families to support Democrats' third world globalist goals is NOT #ABetterDeal
With respect, @realDonaldTrump is the only one who's been speaking to & caring about American workers. It seems like u are playing copy cat.
Please run for president!!!!!!
Economic agenda? You mean govt run agenda Kamala full of entitlements that's your agenda so pathetic you and your ilk your not for workers
Dem. should spend 25% on pres. And start talking programs for us investigators will take care of Russia. and adm. #ABetterDeal
Does this include universal health care and free college tuition?
people : no such thing as "mass incarceration ". Ind. Tried convicted and sentence. No roundups to fill prisons.
Kamala, you don't need Chuck Schumer.
The #ABetterDeal surely will not be gotten via the Democratic Party or by you @SenKamalaHarris. You are just a younger version of Waters. NO
Problem is these types of central government behavior do not result in growth or economic success. Same old deal. #betterdeal
It grows government and keeps DC recession-proof.
Bless your heart. Where you been the past 8 years? You didn't listened to the people then. Why should we listen to you now? Weak slogan
#adumbassslogan. #demsaredummies #MAGA
Good start. Need to be totally, unapologetically transparent with campaigns and money.  Also focus on wealth gap & racism.
https://twitter.com/BasedElizabeth/status/889555571690614786 …
Um, sounds like @HillaryClinton
Why wasn't it time in the last eight years ?  No Deal loser
More imp issue is D messaging. It is AWFUL. D's must admit this to make it better.  e.g. R's: Death tax  D:'s mumble-mumble  Pls RT
That's right and if you'd work with Republicans we'd have a better life. Drop this Russia stupidity and do something important. Quit crying
Far too long Dems robbed from the middle class to instill short sighted programs for the poor & minorities. How are your plans different?
I want to support @SenKamalaHarris but any theft of Hillary's policies (which  @SenSchumer says she didnt convey) will be met with side eye
Honestly, we need a bit more than that tagline!
8 years of Obama.  This is a pathetic lie.  Kamala will do nothing.
You mean white heterosexual families.
Thanks for being a sellout
You will never be the first female president.
A better deal for big pharma and the health insurance industries.  Oil and gas companies will do well too. The people will lose. #DemExit
we had a 8 year nightmare - If you had a better deal dems would be in control! I think I will keep the deal we have now.
After 8 years of President Obama, POTUS is trying for a better deal, why not come to the table with your ideas!
Watching local news.  No mention of this.  Could be because it's more of the same from Hillary's campaign.  Should have mentioned her.
Sorry @SenKamalaHarris @SenSchumer This is a losing slogan. IMO We need something bigger "Green New Deal", Healthy Jobs + Healthy Planet
Give it a rest. You all had your chance and lost, bigly.
Kamala, we need bold ideas, not the same old ones: Medicare for all, basic income (to replace other social services, save Medicare),..
... Pentagon reform (Why do we spent so much here?), tax reform (Corporate, close loopholes, raise taxes on rich)
By ripping off @PapaJohns?  #betteringredients #ABetterDeal
So, @TheDemocrats just stole all of Hillary's ideas and campaign policies, claimed she didn't have them and are repackaging them??  Nice.
Why is it necessary to pretend @HillaryClinton had no policies, when no body would talk about them because of emails? How about some credit?
If @HillaryClinton were male, you better believe she'd get credit for the hard work of putting these policies together during the campaign.
You're playing the woman card that's bullshit it had nothing to do with Clinton being a woman she had no message. What was it?

Why didn't they call it "ABetterAmericanDeal". Get some messaging tips from the asshat that
You could turn your whole political career around and become relevant simply by saying "his name is Seth Rich" publicly.
Fix the #VoterSuppression problem. And tell @SenSchumer to stop trashing Hillary Clinton. HE's our message problem.
Steal from the American worker n give it to the refugees n illegal aliens legal defense fund, welfare recipients, more like #ABetterSteal
First if all, what a bunch of BS and lies. Second- why should Reps agree to work with you? You should be working with them. Get out now!
They've learned NOTHING! #ABetterDeal #StillSanders #DemExit #ProgressivesUnite
I love you Kamala, but this ABetterDeal stuff seems cooked up by Schumer as part of his bashing years of great Dem platform.
#ABetterDeal
It's time we Dems do #WhatsBestForAmerica & find fresh new ideas w/new faces promoting them like yourself!
Recycling a 30s slogan is a loser
Simplistic Slogans and tag lines got Donny elected.
But were not recycled slogans from the depression days of the 30's
Dems need to do #WhatsBestForAmerica w/fresh new ideas & faces promoting
The America First BS was straight outta isolationist, nationalist, '30's 
Not that I like the new one either 
#WhatsBestForAmerica

Which American Families Kamala? What's the fake promise to African Americans for votes this time around? Just call it #abetterlie @CNN
Kamala Harris is a joke. Nothing to show for her time spent in CA outside of refusing to execute a cop killer.  Despicable.
Better pizza. Better politicians. Papa johns.
Great!  Resign.
So no better deals over 8 years?
You're an "ex" prosecutor 3-strikes apologist who criminalized truancy and screwed over poor people. Please go away.
Nah, she's the youth and spirit this party needs.
maybe if you focused on this instead of transgender bathrooms you might have won more elections
You act as thought the last 8 years never happened..
ARE YOU GUYS F'N SERIOUS? THIS IS TRUMP'S MESSAGE THAT YOU SPENT THE LAST YEAR CRITICIZING HIM FOR. #ABetterDeal is a joke. YOU ARE A JOKE.
We can start with not accepting hand picked candidates chosen from a few wealthy donors.
#DEMFAIL... They don't get it.  Carry on being elite, it will lead to more losses.  #MAGA
Your betterdeal is Not America. You stole some things 45 wants, an rolled it all up. Never work, your no longer America. You killed America
no thanks, we'll stick with the BEST! @POTUS @realDonaldTrump #MAGA
terrible name. not a GOOD deal... just slightly BETTER? LBJ didn't push the 'not so bad society'. Dems need to stop trying Republican-lite.
Democrats must do better than better. The new slogan is sluggish, meaningless, mediocre and inept. Start over.
What happened to stronger together...and resistance? Is the better deal...like the McD's ..dollar menu
Yes... impeach 45 .. lock up his family and administration for treason and allow Americans to elect out President
saw you on the tube. impressive. so glad you are looking out for us
It's a plan to rescue the American worker from Depression-era pre-conditions and implement new educational & social strategies.
That's why American families elected @realDonaldTrump and Republicans. You Dems are just trying to ride on their coat tails, but take credit
Except that more families didn't vote for him, so no.
I love the responses! So many people calling you on your bullshit! Yes, please run in 2020. Make this even easier!
I'm a really big fan of yours but PLEASE tell your dem colleagues to find a better slogan. Use Hollywood or anyone good at branding!
I am curious. Once we fix illegal immigration and crooked voting, who will be left to vote Democrat?
#ABetterDeal should read #ABetterAmerica. Any use of the word "deal" shows the Democrats have been Trumpafied. U're will lose with that
Who's Chuck Schumer? Sounds like a real pos! 
Most intelligent people CAN see beyond all their lies but G.O.Partiers believe that if they keep repeating, they will magically come true!
It's time you actually repeal your shitty obamacare and work on tax reform. That would be a better f*cking deal.
#ABetterDeal is an epic failure of a slogan. You will lose again with  this. It has #AntiTrump witten all over it. We need more than that!
really, you need to wake up and look at the last eight years, why do you think , your party lost, jobs suck and force healthcare.
From YOU??? #hillarylite #medicaidforall
Kamala 2020
Neither party recognizes that more than half of American adults today are single.
Dems have been pedaling "better deals" for 50 years, and look where it got you. Dems are finished. R.I.P.
No to Kamala Harris. No to Nytimes. No to Chuck schumer
I can poop in a box and wrap it up and call it new but it is still the same crap. #ABetterDeal
Yes, it is, and we aren't going to get that from Government.
Taking on big pharm, big business & a real infrastructure plan... better late than never! I like it!
How? And what stopped them before? Dems had 2 years of total control, didn't do shit. And now they can?
Read the article. They are doing it now. Stop complaining and let's get to work!
I never complain. ANd I pay the politicians (AND FOR THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE) to work.
I am with u but we have work to do & they are actually proposing a good plan.
The party of Bezos, Zuck, Cook, Buffett, Hollywood  - how did they manage to not make anything happen? what did they do with all that money?
Maybe Trump was a wake up call. Read the article. It's a good start.
I'm tired of reading articles. I'm just watching facts and deeds.
You're in lockstep, obviously, with the ideologically bankrupt wing of the Democratic Party. Guess the Hamptons treated you well
Duh that's why america has taken power away from you
this is the papa John's slogan the fuck democrats
Shumer has truly angered an amazingly large group of us by discrediting HRC.
Talk to me!  What u got to offer me, if it's enough I'll switch and vote Dem.  Make it worth it for me 
A #NewDeal #ABetterDeal, it's all social engineering that leads to socialism and eventually communism.  How about we just #MAGA?
Not sure this slogan is that great. We need to find a LEADER who can relate and reach the working man &tell him straight out policy period
What's in the deal?
Sorry, but life is not a "DEAL"
Suggestion....call it #therealdeal
