The colourful simplicity of this artwork is really beautiful.

yes have one random lady speak for all PRACTICING Muslim women. To each their own 
yes, there is certainly a wide diversity amid muslim women that indeed it doesn't reflect
I could do this all night long. But you'd STILL stay blind #MuslimWomenDay
Ask yourself THIS #Refugees #RefugeesWelcome IF it's a religion of PEACE WHY R there ANY REFUGEES #MAGA #stopfascism #Obama 
have u met a Muslim women? u're talking outta ur ass pushing extremist propaganda. Hope it helps u sleep
Is it necessary to be unkind to me and assume I don't know any muslim women? What purpose does it serve?

Stop normalizing #hijab @Essence #muslimwomensday
In every civilized country a baseball cap is voluntary. In some Muslim countries, hijab is mandatory. See!!
Those are theocracies. We'd have the same problem if the US were a theocracy not an oligarchy.
Not if it were any other religion than Islam. Israel is Jewish and is a free nation
Only because the extremist factions ie Hasidic aren't in control. Any hyper-conservative religious fundamentalism is bad.
I'm an atheist, so I don't want theocracy, but can make distinctions based on outcome
Absolutely. I'm Xtian but I don't want any theocracy and prefer separation of church and state everywhere. It's best.
are you kidding me??
MGT - GCC FOR SURE.
we can only be happy about this day, when all women come together to condemn #shariaLaw practices that are 100% anti women
we need to stand up for the muslim women that are victims of stoning , child marriage, polygamy, sharia law.
how can you "celebrate" when you don't acknowledge the suffering first. it's like celebrate black history month during slavery
isn't black slavery still happening in Muslim countries?
Asian slavery in saudia Arabia & Kuwait is normal practice
Amazing how many people associate some heinous crimes against women exclusively with Muslims. Assailants come from all religions.
@yassmin_a Don't you love the sudden concern for Muslim women's rights from spoilt aging white men. Really?
seriously. Bunch of clowns
@SenKamalaHarris when is #christianwomensday
Why are they faceless?
That is very good #hajiab #muslim #islam 
Stupid white liberals.

This is YOUR #MuslimWomensDay

Most Muslim women can't celebrate it. You have to do it in their place.
black people can be liberals , or have i read the wrong book on how to be black
thank you, Essence!
Happy colors to cover that the Burka is slave garb. It's a sign that men own you.
no they don't I am a feminist and a Muslim and my family respects that and I speak for my self
Happy #MuslimWomensDay!
Oh!  They have their own day now?
YAY! & Tomorrow we can celebrate #ChastityBeltDay!

I love you!!

@ninaturner Beauty.
@NylonMag ðŸ–’ðŸ–’ðŸ–’ðŸ–’ðŸ–’#Muslim Womens Day
@SenKamalaHarris Is this where their keeper-men don't torture them for the day?No stonings, clits cut out, or acid attacks allowed?
Really??? Your magazine is disgusting #muslimwomensday #MondayMorning

We are beautiful! The Mighty MGT!
@ceharasohh come through essence !
THIS A THING OMG TODAY IS A V GOOD DAY.
this shows that only hijab wearing women are muslim ? are you kidding me..
.@Essence Time is of the essence!
~ Ain't nothing happy about it...
Muslim support of #MuslimWomensDay is dwarfed by #hangayaznizami on twitter. They are literally demanding a lynching.
happy #ChristianWomenDay..I guess that ain't politically correct...Btw, Muslim ain't a race
FYI they are Muslim women with no covered head.
#muslimwomensday Working towards a world in which every day is every woman's/child's/man's/human's day, regardless of differences.
@lsarsour nope
The Hijab is a symbol of oppression.
thank you, I love my Muslim & non Muslim sisters, let's stop the hate& ignorance rooted in lack of knowledge of history & politics
So, white women can't be muslim?
its hard
lmao
@lsarsour islam is the real War on Women.
@lsarsour This has to be a joke.  And another reason why libs lost in Nov.
@ava Not all muslin women wear a hijab!!!
The ones who don't want to be treated like garbage do.
Nah, that's middle easten culture, hindus & christians do it it too, nothing to do with Islam.
I didn't know this was a thing, but I think it's dopest #muslimwomensday
Happy #MuslimWomensDay!
@SapeloSquare nice! Whose artwork?
Suad it looks like the artist that did your image a few years back but I can't recall their name? Beautiful
@lsarsour now take off your hijab. You are no longer property and oppressed. You no longer are second class to men
Â¡FELIZ DIA de la Mujer Musulmana! #MuslimWomensDay! @Essence @lsarsour
Thank you! :)
@lsarsour So no white women are Muslims?
this is Essence though!
not asking @Essence to do a paper on white women, I'm pointing out what they should have, white women are Muslim too
Actually,  Black Muslim women are marginalized within the Muslim narrative while being a large population
Why would you be celebrating a cult that objectifies, degrades & oppresses women.  You are as sick as the men who perpetrate this.
u have a great one
.@Essence Time is of the essence!
Did ypu beat your wife extra hard on this special day?
proud of u
