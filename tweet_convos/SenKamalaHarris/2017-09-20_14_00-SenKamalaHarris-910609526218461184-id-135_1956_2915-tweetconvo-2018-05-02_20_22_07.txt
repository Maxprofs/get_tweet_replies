shoulda coulda
Can somebody please make this nightmare stop!
You and Bernie Sanders scared them with talk of Medicare for all. Good job!! Keep it up...their true colors will make them lose their jobs.
The responses below show how uninformed your followers our. 
All states accept Medicaid expansion money Something obama couldn't do.
Glad to see you will not be voting for it Kamala.At least we have one senator with integrity.
#IWasHealthy until diagnosed w/ #RheumatoidArthritis and #BreastCancer #VoteNoOnGrahamCassidy @SenJohnMcCain @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski
Why fight so hard senator we have lost our country our safety our freedom our rights our protections and no one has stood up for those
I think we are to the point of "what's good in the world?" Not a damn thing honestly
@SenKamalaHarris, I want you to know I'm very ill & can barely afford the great insurance I have w ACA. I need constant care or I will die.
Why would a highly respected like Lindsay graham a It his name on this highly controversial piece of legislation

I cannot believe #LindseyGraham is sponsoring the garbage. His owners must be pressing hard. To bad for those he people who need coverage
All states will accept Medicaid expansion money. Something Obama couldn't do. You've been manipulated by this person.
All states will accept Medicaid expansion money Something obama couldn't do. The obvious isn't your strong point. Manipulation is.
These Senators are key in defeating #GrahamCassidy - please send them a tweet!
@RandPaul 
@SenatorCollins
@lisamurkowski
@SenJohnMcCain
I've been calling @SenJohnMcCain for two days. He has a chance to be a hero. I hope he takes it.
It's got to be defeated! It's obvious the GOP doesn't care about their constituents or the American people.

Wrong. All States will accept Medicaid expansion money Something obama couldn't do. Ms harris is spreading false info again
How is this possible? Are these Senators that cruel? #ACASavesLives #ACA @lisamurkowski @SenJohnMcCain
So happy to see you and your liberal Democrats upset about this new Healthcare bill. With your reaction it means a good healthcare bill.
@SenJohnMcCain @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski Allow time for a bipartisan approach to work on fixing the ACA.  PLEASE vote NO!  
The only question I have about #GrahamCassidy  , why did the @GOP  save their worst idea 4 last ?
All states will accept Medicaid expansion money Something obama couldn't do. You can change healthcare in your state try it.
People, if you must attempt to insult please ensure you have the correct black female. This is Sen Harris not former NSA Rice. Jeezzzz!!!
Focus Calif's energy keeping Obamacare. withdraw from @SenSanders single payor or GOP plan will pass! @jimmykimmel @SenFeinstein @JoeNBC
You let crazy Berrnie get up and debate this issue and they will say see socialism is what they want ! Obama care must go worst choice ever
Not true.  And this time it will pass
Stop lying to advance your agenda. You know, like when you lied about wire tapping & made an ass out of yourself publicly.
These people are heartless. Why are they willing to do this to us? I want the same healthcare that they have, I deserve it, I am an American
well that would cost some money and who is supposed to pay for that, i am not, i have my own bills to pay with hard earned money,
If you say so, that's all the more reason to support it. #GrahamCassidy
I bet you lose a lot of clients over that tweet ... smart
Interesting that you'd choose that article to make your point.
Funny how the party that continually pushed states rights now claim states can’t be relied on to run properly. Compare Kansas to California.
Both major parties have taken that stance
....and so are the @SenateGOP who are lying to try & pass it. They will all burn in HELL
While they talk about makers & takers, Republicans are rewarding states that didn’t try to provide healthcare for their citizens

As has been their M. O., this bill was clearly written by rich men with no input from women or those that represent the middle class.
Let's make sure GOP pays for their incompetence, hate and disregard for Americans during the midterm elections. They don't care about us.
It's surprising just how far GOP will go to eliminate any Obama era legislation. They're willing to compromise lives to prove a point.
the G-C bill is designed to undue the unfair, burdensome and often fraudulent entitlements established under the ACA
We'll never win until we talk like Republicans. The msg shouldn't be "bad policy," it should be "Republicans want your children to die."
Why do politicians HATE the people of the United States? All they want to do is rake us over the coals financially or KILL US! WTF! #Resist
Notice how they don't list the reasons they think it's worse because they are just blindly making these statements. Liberals are liars!
Go on tv- tell Americans as well as Californians what WILL be taken away by Trump and his GOP GOONS- ppl will dies again b/c of no cov
Sell out
CORRUPT Corporate-Whore Dems like yourself gave us the (UN)Affordable Care Act NOT Single-Payer when Dems controlled Congress & Presidency.
Just curious; Will the heartless, soulless, GOP require themselves to be part of their evil plan? Or will they exempt themselves, as usual?
What's this we stuff? You mean Susan Collins and John McCain beat the last bill.
Umm... didn't @SenKamalaHarris also vote against the bill?
how does #TRUMPS wiretapped ass taste?
Repealing the ACA is an assault on the USA
Call senators & reps.   Tell them you vote yes you're DEFINITELY OUT OF OFFICE!

WHY? Because you say? Your credibility is too damaged over the wire tap thing. Remember?
You can’t remember what didn’t happen.
Every time it comes up I think "ok, this time y'all just being hyperbolic", but then I read it and it's like "no, this really is that bad"
NORMAL people in Government would compromise or tweak a bill to make it work for constituents.These guys just get a bigger knife to stick in
They have no plan 4 heathcare - they never have. They just have a plan 2 cut taxes for the wealthy donors and screw everyone else!
you were wrong about the wiretapping issue.. did you apologize for being wrong and ridiculing Trump?

Claims that #GrahamCassidy-Heller-Johnson doesn't cover pre-existing conditions -- #FakeNews on steroids! https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/910641701064204288 …
Every next bill is worse than the last. This is insanity.
Yes it is! This article is an excellent description of the major issues with this bill!
These didn't age well. You lied or are ignorant of the facts.  Which is it?
A liberal will never admit they were wrong. Liberalism is definitely a mental defect
Let's see...block grants to the states means power to the people and not the federal Gov...I can see now why you're against it. #FullRepeal
maybe you Dems will stop the whining about trump this and trump that,start working with this admin with real input to replace  failed ACA
Please get out and secure the "no" votes to protect America. It is no different than their last attempt, as bad or worse. Thx for all you do
Typically when a really bad healthcare bill gets defeated, one would expect that a better one would be presented, not one that is worse.
You get what you deserve. They'll keep getting worse. #Resist , Right? You now see what obstructionism buys you.

What's radical. Having people pay?
Just ask your counterparts: "Have you no soul?"
Democrats NEED to Stay focused!
Right Ca will get less money start looking to tax toilet paper Kamala your gonna need it
Heartless folks here every last one of these men need to be thrown in jail!! A sordid bunch!
Stop this bill now - this is a travesty ! We have so much money here everyone should have healthcare!
Repeal quickly please ! Forget replace
Obama was dumb..real issue was illegals NEVER pay for medical, they just have to show up at Emergency Rooms and must be treated for free 1/2
then hospitals are forced to over charge legal citizens and those who have insurance ( I work at a hospital )
I know I seen that few years back . I was upset about it thinking insurance rates will be going up,and they did $300 a pop more yearly .
How that wiretap comment going ?  enjoy 8 years of losing .
Thank you for keeping up the fight! Health doesn't care who you voted for. This plan is a death sentence 
I wouldn't buy a used car from @BillCassidy
Too bad you wasted all your energy on that one then eh?
And he freaks me out. Looks like a doll from the 50's
When the primary objective is to undo everything and anything with Obama's name on it, it is basically racism 1st, health care last.
That's a fact.
URGENT! You're exhausted, I'm exhausted, millions of us are exhausted. Get on up! This is another heartless greed filled bill.
Yes. Keyboard warrior. Useless.
Told everyone I could think of. Love you 46!
What is wrong with these GOP Senators ?
They are a bunch of sick racist ass backward extreme extremist missing the whole point of HealthCare 4 ALL!
It's actually less about sheer greed. Their donors are threatening to cut them off if they don't get something passed.
Vox. Liberal fake news source.
It's true you suck!!!!
#krazyKamala is nuts. She need great mental health insurance. Call your rep today!
Why did you vote to increase our military budget by $700 billion? Isn't our military budget already bloated enough?
It is like them saying...HOW ABOUT NOW OVER AND OVER FOR THE SAME EVIL.

The Deathcare Bill by the uncaring Republican party
Congress where very smart people behave like "DUMB ASSES". Nature of ALL ins. is those that don't use it pay for those that do. Mandate
@BillCassidy @LindseyGrahamSC  No regard for human lives.
Thank you for voting No.  #noGrahamCassidy #SaveMedicaid @autismvotes @autismspeaks
#GrahamCassidy are both Big Fat Liars! #PantsOnFire
So the reason the last one didn’t pass was because it wasn’t cruel enough? Not surprised.
Yes @SenKamalaHarris, (Family) your tweet(notification) TRUTHFULLY, 4:00pm.Graham-Cassidy Medicare Bill Again. @CNN @wolfblitzer 
5:00pm @CNN , @SenKamalaHarris
6:00pm @PBS ch. THE NEWS HOUR, Anchor: @judywoodruff , @SenKamalaHarris
Blowing up anything that makes sense seems to be the @GOP model.
WE NEED A CALL TO ACTION!! Kamala, take charge and tell us to March in our cities, the day and the time!!! WE MUST SHOW NUMBERS
Lol while all the employed are at work who outnumber you about 20 to 1.
When will you and your fellow senators call these guys out: they are about to lose their rubber-stamp prez and the people bear the brunt
DID NOT pass the Kimmel TEST!!!
Rick Santorum claims he and Sen Graham cooked this up. They weren't nominated. They think their ideas should replace the winners bad ideas?!

Ok... that's funny!
If this bill passes affordable and accessible will mean the Emergency Room is your health insurance.
If #GOP passes that bill, @SenateGOP MUST all go on their plan. If good for us, good for them! (Except GOP who vote no.) #ProtectOurCare
They'll never go on it - it's Death. These GOP Senators run around with Drs on speed dial 4 them & families - at public expense!
Yeah coz damn they give the states the same amount of money as Ocare just making them devise a plan suited to their states.  Horrible
We have to defeat it!
Thank you for being a voice for the people!
Especially elderly, and children

"The illiterate of the future are not those that cannot read or write. They are those that cannot learn, unlearn, relearn." = GOP #cruel
Just emailed Senator Murkowski 's office.
GOP will go 2 any lengths 2 give a TAX break to Wealthiest TOP 2% as they Crucify Middle class & Poor.  Sick, dishonest n Demented Bastards!
That was a f...... up bill.
Actually it's soooo bad that Cassidy can't even explain or justify it himself!
Thank you for fighting for us
And we will beat it again!
I'm sure the GOP intentions are pure.
But still better than Obamacare
OK @ziggy1608 take your time and let's know how is it better than the ACA or Obama care??
