Kamala a communist by any other name is still Kamala.
@SenKamalaHarris time to open an impeachment investigation. @realDonaldTrump
Would have to do it on obvious emoluments offenses at this point. Other investigations not finished.
Or obstruction of justice. Or attempted witness intimidation. Or abusing his position to enrich himself. Or blackmail. Or sexual assault.
Bannon going End of Act one.
Trump goes in Act Three, more worried about the main threat to our liberties. Thread.
So is the Mercer Bannon plan, for Trump to be so outrageous so extreme, that when Pence comes in, the mild mannered Nazi appears acceptable?
There's the right side and wrong side. Intolerance and hate vs peace, acceptance and unity. Hate always loses in  the end
We need a whole lot of @GOP to quit hiding  saying they're on vacation and come out and denounce this equivalency notion fr. Nazi in Chief
Deep down inside they admire Trump. He's saying what they are too afraid to say. Just that Trump is too stupid to gage his actions.
#25thAmendmentNow 
#GOPGONE2018 
Is the only answer 2 these monsters because if they don't denounce @realDonaldTrump then they're monsters 2
We already know they are monsters. No need to confirm this. Sold their soul like Judases. Hope they all rot in hell
Will you please press the House for an Impeachment of @realDonaldTrump !!!
#impeachment has to start in the House.  Senate can only convict but not initiate.
Dan, did you not read ALL of my words?? Mansplaining on a Tuesday is not needed but love the thought!
My apologies. Only saw the last line
Thanks.
OK then, mansplain to me exactly what grounds she has to press the house?  Please be specific
#ImpeachTrump #FireBannonGorkaMiller #PenceKnew #Charlottesville #Resist
.@realDonaldTrump "By whatever means" congress MUST remove you and your wanna be fascist regime! #ImpeachTrump  #FireBannonGorkaMiller 
Not good enough. The time for talk and tweeting has ended. Trump must be removed immediayely. What are you doing about it?
Keep rioting. He declares martial law. Antifa and BLM have turned the cops and military against the left. Guess who they will side with? Lol
Orthodox Jews holding Trump support sign should explain the many sides of Kristallnacht.
Probably because the left has been bashing them over the Palestinians. Just like the cops are pro Trump, because the left attacks them
Trump is never going to disavow his racist base. #Truth
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: there are not “many sides” to this. 
Just like the left won't disavow Antifa, which is just as bad
It's time Kamala for you and entire Dems to speak out against Trump's hate.  You guys should be on every network, speaking to every host.
If Jesus, you been living under a rock. That's all they do 24/7.
many sides? how about you protect free speech? until someone does wrong? or only blm can destroy things? protest now? real free.
There are only 2 sides - the good side & the evil side, & Trump has decided to defend the evil side!

Let's see, a group from ISIS and a group of unruly Democrats.  I can't tell the difference
I have no hope for impeachment. Repubs won't even call him out by name over equivocating Nazis, they'll never stand up to him.
You should consider running in 2020. We need to look down the road & believe hope is not too far away.
Yes please. That will guarantee another 4 years for Trump. The progressives are already pushing against her and any other corporate dem
Trump will always look for an escape route for his white supremacist friends, either justification or explanation.
What's the lefts excuse for antifa. They are just as bad
#FreedomofSpeech #FreedomsofReligion #communityorganizing. AND THEN THERE'S @algore @santaclaralaw
honestly, until they do wrong. let them have day and move on. why are we so hyper about grp of whites that noone but them care about? blm ?
I cannot believe that this pathological paranoid lying racist has gone back to his damned "many sides" horseshit. #25thAmendmentNow
There are only 2 sides right and racist!!
Are many side.. wake up
No, like everything else, there's only your side, and if someone else has a different opinion, you simply talk over them
dont issue the permit next ti me then...or was it done just fo rthis reason by left? stop it before.
Many sides allowed a shipful of Jews de be denied entrance into the U.S. and returned to Germany and death.
Funny how the left used Jews when it suits them, but usually bash them over the Palestinians any other time.
You are correct there are not "many sides" to this racism and Trump's blatant support for fomenting hate and violence is abhorrent!
Keep rioting so he can declare martial law. He has the military, police and millions of gun loving Americans on his side. Safe space useless
There are only 2 sides. Trump has chosen his sides. I stand with Sen Harris and the snti Nazis against Trump.
Here is the other side. The mask wearing, cop hating, flag burning, free speech hating, commies called ANTIFA
#AntifaTerrorist that is all they are!
Time to Impeach!!
Why don't you condemn Antifa too? A bunch of mask wearing, flag burning, cop hating, communists loving thugs who attack concervatives
We know that. It's his base that doesn't.
Action plans! I am with you!!
Thank you, Senator. That our country has people like you willing to serve & speak out makes me feel that we can get through this. And proud.
Really reaching for written space, Eh?  "many sides," means "many sides."  Shame to see an empty headed Boxer replaced by another.
@SenKamalaHarris HEY whack jobs on the Left: 
CONDEMN violence, hatred, property destruction of Domestic Terrorists #Antifa #CONDEMNAntifa
When are you going to update me on your cohort's threats to murder me Kamala @SenKamalaHarris?  cc: @jeffsessions @TheJusticeDept @FBI
There seem 2b many sides 2 the planned white supremacist rally approved by NPS 4 federal land @ Crissy Field in SF. 

What side are you on?
Thank you senator Harris. But we need more. If nothing changes he will keep acting like this

do you have a private twitter account you can use? I'd rather you not represent CA when expressing your opinions.
Thank you @SenKamalaHarris for taking a stand against @realDonaldTrump racist dangerous divisive rhetoric! Please ask @GOP to join you!
#KamalaBomaye!
NOT MANY SIDES....
Only the right side...w/o the tiki torches, shields, rifles, and swastikas.

Impeach now.
I'm English so help me here. Basically the South didn't lose hard enough so they want to be surrounded by reminders?
http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-lying-prosecutors-20150201-story.html ….  #KROOKEDKAMALA
Now that your Russia story is outted for the fraud it is let's playthe racist card.  Keep atit #KROOKEDKAMALA and you'll keep losing!  #MAGA
"Many sides" is what they'll say when they attempt to replace our Science and History with Religious Dogma and Historic Revisionism.
That is precisely what his " make America great again" is! His morbid defense of the weapons branding side exposed his beliefs! He's a FRAUD
#ImpeachTrump NOW.
Sn. Harris - now is the time to take the first step, lead this country out of darkness. Teach Americans to coexist, be hope, a happy future.
Imagine the outcry if it were black/brown people matching armed to the teeth like soldiers! Paddy wagon tout de suite! #HypocriteTrump
There are many sides to racism, the worst is the middle class, turn a blind eye, nothing to do with me side.
That's ALL There is to it!
Trump no longer has the moral authority to govern. He must be convinced to resign for the good of the country or be impeached.
AMEN
There are only many sides for those who want to legitimize racism
Was white/black drinking fountains in Memphis & a lame negro was thrown from only seat on bus for sitting next to me. I was 11. Sad times.
GET HIM OUT OF OFFICE!!!
Yes,Ma'am! There is only ONE SIDE,and,The *"president"ain't on it. Disgusting.
The 1st Amend guarantees the right to non-violent free speech for all, even if we hate the speech. Condemn the message but don't assault ppl
Well said.

Here are all the good people on the left
Can you PLEASE HELP us out with @KeepYourHomeCA
We have asked you and @SenFeinstein many times. No response. PLEASE HELP us, your supporters
What about Antifa , they had shields,clubs,masks,BLM had a guy using hairspray as a flamethrower. Antifa had soda cans filled with cement
3 terror groups showed up BLM,advocates killing Police. Nazis evil racists. Antifa rioting,burning,looting since January,thats 3 sides there
Your argument is also moot because both sides can be wrong. Violence to make a point is wrong period. Don't condone violence Senator
Your argument is moot when Blacks today call for segregated campuses, dorms, etc. They are self segregating FGS. Going backwards 
No one is going to vote for you, Tulsi or Nina are far better choices, but only in 2028 after @SenSanders' 8 years in office. #feelthebern
Please. PLEASE. Do something. Someone do something. ??? I am afraid.
@RealMuckmaker I remember trying to explain to my young sons why they shouldn't wear kippah on walk to synagogue
We are all counting on you and your colleagues. Do the right thing. #Impeach45
Thats because you haven't been paying attention..
Condi said it best . I'm on her side....

Wow Kamala - I see lots of demands to "impeach trump" in the reply section. I had a really good laugh. Thanks
Please call for a censure of the President in Congress. His remarks can not go unanswered. #charlottesville
WHAT does jared kushner say to all this?
Dolt 45 showed his true colors today and must be removed.
If you make a presidential bid for 2020 (or before), I WILL vote for you.
Kamala, we hear you, but we need to SEE you.  Dems have no visible leader today and we can't expect 45 to EVER foster the healing we need!
What is an Alt Left? When was they founded? TF?
Kamala As one of your constituents I plead with you to Impeach Trump who is Unfit to serve is a disgrace to our Nation & has breeched oath
Well said.
If one is a "fine person" with a cause and the Nazis, White Nationalists give  a parade of support, they will be judged to be associates!
Words meaningless.  Who hz the guts 2 say enough z enough-he must go. Surreal that calls 4 his departure won't b awaiting us in the morning
I remember reading somewhere in the history books that the world fought against the Nazi's; and now our POTUS says some are "fine people"??
Very poetic and all bot you had two sides who apparently both came to fight, and police instructed to let them.
Congress must stop tweeting individually, privately expressing their true feelings and come together as a cohesive unit and censure Trump.
Formally!
For?
trump supporters seem to consume one-sided news - trump watches all types of news and believes only the far right perspective - terrifying
Actions are more powerful than words. What is the Senate going to do about this madman?
Please run for President. Please. Harris/Waters 2020.
His father was a Klansman so what do you expect Trump to be? 

The orange doesn't fall far from the tree.

Wow! I agree with you 100%. There is the ALT Right side & the ALT Left side. Both should have been tear gassed & aggressively taken to jail!
Senator, your comment is worthy of being knitted on a pillow. But, disagreeing with someone's views  does not give the right to attack them.
One side only and that's Nazis. Everyone knows they're evil!
Time for discussion is over. Reinstate the voter rights amendment. Pass a law against gerrymandering. Talk is cheap. Action speaks louder
I think Trump picked a side...and it's very dark.

Is it possible to double-like a tweet?
Can we please start the impeachment process?  This has gone too far. #ImpeachTrump
There is only one side: AGAINST!
Both sides are in the wrong.
#impeach
Senator, please take action to remove Trump from office. He has no idea how to govern. #CaliforniaVoter
Goooo Kamala, gooooo
Yeseree Bob! Them were Good Ol' Boys! We've heard this music before, When Bigots Are Going To Jail!
There is a side & there is the enemy of the side. Trump has chosen to defend the enemy, betraying all of what America stands for.
Agree even to ride a bus.
#25thAmendmentNow
There are 2-good and evil. He picked evil. His supporters need to decide what side of history they want to be in. Looking at you @SenToomey
Yes there are,,,one being the terrorist Antifa crowd.
Many sides can also mean that both side are equally wrong. You keep saying it, and I will keep wondering what the F--- you're talking about.
There are no longer "many sides"  to the impeachment issue.
or poetically....
Perspective shopping
Policy flopping
Staff hopping
Jaw dropping
You went to Trump inauguration while majority of CA delegation boycotted. RT if you agree.
Trump is not my President
As a Jew, as an American, as a human, words cannot express my disgust and disappointment. This is not my President.
How many sides are there when someone threatens your child or your mother? Are there sides to Islamic terrorism too?
Funny, the ACLU says there were more than one side to this.
So you believe it is all right to harm innocent people as Antifa and BLM did on Saturday? And again on Sunday in Seattle?
Fascist,racist,violent white supremacists are left extremists like fascist,racist,violent Antifa.Left extremism is the prob
Lies. There were the Nazis vs Antifa/Communists.  Quit telling lies.
#KamalaHarris @KamalaHarris Like the side where #Democrats openly support #Nazi #AltRight in #Ukraine? #Antifa 
The Intersectional reality of #Democrats #JoeBiden #Charlottesville #UniteTheRight #AltRight #Racist #America & #BlackLivesMatter #StayWoke 
You are exactly right, Senator Harris.

Yes you are on the wrong side because you don't believe in principles, just sides and lies.
No, there's your side (violent Antifa) and the wrong side??
@LESTERJ205
I suppose your only qualification 2 B senator is knowing how 2 filibusterWhat a bunch of gobbledygookU have no idea what D Prez meant
Tho your taking it out of proportion
But "many sides" are what make everyone unique

No just 3 KKK,antifa,BLM except in Chicago. I don't give a damn for any of them
Be sure to point out that the leader of the #WhiteSupremacists group in #Charlottesville was a staunch @BarackObama supporter. Fact.
Do You Believe Saturday In VA. is the new norm?
Old Norm?
Or not the real America?
We need to unite under the agreement that @realDonaldTrump is proving to be unfit to serve. We must take action, #25thAmendmentNow
Point of no return @GOP  @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachTrumpNow
Wake Up America-we now have an HONEST @POTUS in WhiteHouse-leading America -this is a man who speaks truth-God Bless @realDonaldTrump Ca
There is no room for racism in America. Trump is a pathological liar. He's no leader. he's made America a joke.
I wouldn't expect you'd have a problem with BLM or ANTIFA starting that riot or for you to acknowledge hate from anything not white or facts
Senator America needs you. Please invoke the 25th Amendment and remove Trump from office. We are not safe and we need your help.
Rhetoric is all you spew.  Just like "smarter" so emotional but not rational. At reelection time you'll say you fought for this. Rhetoric
Congress needs to move on Impeachment.  Recess needs to be cut short for the good of our country.
We can not have a racist president it's time to remove trump from office.
45 was so insulting that it made be sick to my stomach!!
There is a wrong side & a right side.  Hate is always the wrong side.
This guy said blame on both sides! Wtf! Impeach this guy, America does not need him! See what he supports! What about Russia, tell that!
A divided house cannot make peace ever..

I stole this comment. So true
Just the morally correct side and the side that has no morals!
Kamala- the bad kid on the playground (Trump) must be knocked down- organize the Dems and speak out as a group NOW

And something totally stinks abt Charlottesville mayor...https://twitter.com/cbsnews/status/896400997865730049 …
There are two sides. It's just that one side includes bigots, haters, anti-semites, the KKK and white supremacists. I cry for USA!
The other side includes lawless thugs who arrived armed to fight. Both sides were wrong.
Guns & shields vs. posterboard & preachers.
No, there are not. We have a white supremacist for a 'pres'.
Thank you for your service!
Please do everything in your power to remove Trump & Nazi-sympathizers frm office...they're ALL dangerous to country, environment & world
As a legal SoCal resident I stand proudly w my beloved @POTUS all your lies against him are obvious 2 everyone-even desperate Dems-quiet now
You're outnumbered by quite a few million in California. Perhaps you should look into moving to a red state where your opinion matters 
So the side with Russian flags is the right side Kamala?  Do YOU disavow THEM?
Completely agree with yr position
Exactly. Those who say Black Lives Matter - equality group - is same as supremacist groups are disgusting. False equivalence, what-aboutism
Bullshit. A group that targets and calls for the death of cops are atleast as bad
Nailed it!
This lunatic has to be impeached.
All I want to hear from everyone when they come back from break is impeachment. This is embarrassing.
