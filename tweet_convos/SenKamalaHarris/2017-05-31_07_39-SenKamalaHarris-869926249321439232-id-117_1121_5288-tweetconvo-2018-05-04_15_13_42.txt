#FailingToPlanMeansPlanningToFail #ClimateFail
Sen. Harris, we're the statewide climate change coalition and we agree. Please follow @CAdelivers and @CleanEnergyCA to track our progress!
Oregon is with you! @OregonGovBrown @EllenRosenblum @tedwheeler @RobNosse @RonWyden @JeffMerkley @repblumenauer @RepBonamici
Thank you dear lady!!
Are NY & CA the only 2 progressive and intelligent states left?
No there the stupidest states the rest have common sense and know it would cost jobs and is too expensive.
Let it be known that we had 2 small(!) solar panels installed & our electric bill went from $600+ to $25 per month. For real
How much were the solar panels? You may not get that $$ back in your lifetime and the panels surely will not last forever.
The only useful fuel for the Fire of Progressive Hopes and Dreams is other people's money. Hope it doesn't run out, but I know you'll try
Look, I don't care if you want to blow YOUR economic brains out-go for it!
But we're SICK of your refugees in Texas
#BuildAWall w California
Yes!!!  Thank you for representing us so well.  We cannot allow @realDonaldTrump to destroy all progress and momentum.
Sen. Harris, why don't you start impeachment proceedings?  What is Congress waiting for, an invitation?
Fyi, impeachment is started in the House, not the Senate. Takes time, be patient,  the investigation is the first step & underway.
I've been tweeting POTUS this -  =
In the hopes he understands the pictures more than words. Apparently not.
Thank you for,standing up and saying this. The news this morning is making me ill.
You do understand you can change the channel
Huh?
I bet you will and keep thousands unemployed from government regulation stifling
I am saving up money to move right now. This country has gone crazy.
Obama never had the senate vote on it because it would of never passed.
CA has large economy & it's out of money. Taxes rising again & deficit is out of control. How about you focus on improving CA economy first
Hell yeah we will! Why would anyone want to go back? Oh right, it's all about money. Sad.. can't spend that money when the world is on fire.
If @POTUS pulls out of #parisclimateagreement, we push back with a 48hr nationwide #consumptionstrike #spendnothing #weaponizeconsumption
Thank you CA
Definitely need to regulate political hot air. 
It is sad that Koch brothers $$ can turn a blind eye when even China & India are now working to save our planet #resist #climatechange
Yea right China is favorable in your eyes. Whose the buyer of American coal? And has the worst air quality?  Your China!!
Yeah. you and Moonbeam will chase even more businesses out of CA.
Thank you. #santacruz
And look at all the business that has left California. Keep it up and we will be the poorest state of the Union
@LorenaSGonzalez @LorenaAD80 there ought to be a California law

#california
Thank from Washington State! We'll be right there with you in the fight.
How is California doing in the fight to reduce homelessness?
Why are you not a cosponsor on S27??
Thank you! #mysenator
Try balancing your budget.

suggest we stop F*CKING #Fracking in California: Questions and Concerns http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/campaigns/california_fracking/faq.html … #ClimateChange #Environment
Rex Tillerson supports the accord.  Trump re-certifies being off-base if he pulls out.  The "CEO Council should revolt". @elonmusk is right!
So glad we in California have you in Washington, and on the right side of history!
More crts recognizing federal stnds superceding state than used to exist. Better for Congress to act to force inclusion in global fight.
thank you Senator
Of course it will! That's why they call it wacky land!
Thank you!!
The country has withstood everything thrown at it. Can it possibly survive the current climate in Washington? None you should rest #resist.
Can CA just sign Paris agreement for CA? Our economy is big enough.
ca
Yes! California (and others) will lead the way.
You do not speak for ALL Californians. Just the elitist left and nothing more.
Proud of my beautiful golden state 
West coast! 
Proud of you and proud of California. Example of good in a sea of darkness taking over our country.
THANK YOU
Thank you so much!! My children and future grandchildren thank you!!
Washington State, too!!!
Until it drives every last job and business out of the state and we are a bankrupt tourist destination like Greece.
Thank you, Senator.
California is an inanimate object. It can't do anything. It's the people of CA & you don't speak for me.
@DoctorRobin they will have to do it without federal aid$$$ oh get it from there illegal welfare programs,,
@DoctorRobin they should they are the number one polluters!!!!! From la u can't even see the mountains because of the smog!
How can we keep the Trump administration from drilling off our western coast. Our beaches need protection!
Help us secede Kamala 
Please! We must lead the way for this country. Today is a sad day for the environment and our world
Thank you  - needed to hear this today
Born and bred in Southern California and proud to stand beside you in this effort. Thank you for continuing to fight the good fight for us!
Thank you California.
Great! A thoughtful balanced approach is necessary. Jobs are just as important as climate, maybe more. No pork belly additions.
Thank you for this.  Thank you
Proud to be your constituent. Keep up the great work.
Thank you!
As will the rest of America. On OUR terms, not China's, Germany's or any other nations'. #maga
Thank you for this Senator Harris! We Californians support taking the lead on fighting Climate Change! @JerryBrownGov
Thank you for fighting for the future of the country
Thank you. Give me five minutes to cry about @realDonaldTrump leaving the #ParisAgreement , then I'll jump back in.
I love you Senator, you rock. California is lucky to have you
How? Can we work with international leaders without the federal government?
Via insane taxes and regulations that in the end will do nothing but suck the money from our wallets and put it in your pockets!
Can states stay in even if the (un)president chooses to take the US out?
They can.. but it will cost the states money
Thank you!!
thank you Senator
Every move he makes is a devastating blow. His dirty energy & lack of caring for our planet is disturbing. #stress #anxiety #depression
California is now the real leader of the U.S.A. in every way.
Thx, #CALeg! #NVLeg is also passing MANY #cleanenergy/ee bills this session for @GovSandoval to sign incl #AB206: https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/new-bill-make-nevada-national-leader-clean-energy-economy-decades/ …
We can do this nation wide, in fact. Everyone of us can do our part to take care of the earth & fight climate change.
California take the Global lead!!!
Lucky to be a Californian - but Trump's actions will affect all - he is a threat to the poor, women, children, the air we breathe -
YES! I'm There Sen. Kamala Harris of Oakland,California, watching now @NBC #TODAY Kathie & Hoda, being after #LiveKellyandRyan You KNOW!!
As your constituent, I appreciate all you're doing. Keep up the good work.  We have your back
Thank you!
Do they put drugs in the water in CA? Climate change was made up to get funds from the people. Democrats thrive on scaring people for $$
be realistic - humanity is barely thinking about the next few decades, how are we gonna manage climate change on the order of eons?
THANK YOU
Yes. Everyone stop driving. Stop eating. Stop smoking. Stop farting. Etc.
California must maintain its role ...
Sorry..."form" an entity
Oregon and Washington will be there with you
Can those states who believe science for an entity together and sign in on the Paris agreement?
Thank you!
I wonder if the states who lead this country in fighting climate change can remain in the Paris agreement.. ignore Trump decision ..?
Under federalism, states can do what they want; & I suspect CA will continue to pursue economy killing policies, chasing out productive ppl.
But not for healthcare, apparently.  Super-delegates made sure of that.
Y'all need to give me a job so I can move out of Texas
