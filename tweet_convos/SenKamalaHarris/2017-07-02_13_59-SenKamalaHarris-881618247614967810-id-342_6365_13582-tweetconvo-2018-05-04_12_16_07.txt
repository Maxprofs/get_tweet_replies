Would love to hear your thoughts on single payer 4 CA..  #lobbyistsgetout
I'll give you my unsolicited thoughts, if you are interested. :)
good read..   i think for any health care system to work, we first have to eliminate the pharmaceutical lobbyists from our government.
Thank you. Lobbying, dark money, & ratfucking is another series I'll work on down the road.
Also...why not both? If @POTUS44 can do 2 things at once, surely 100 senators can.
You"Democrats",STOP THROWING American taxpayers's money 4political gains&useYOURS 2teach wz URexample.Question,R YOUR CHILDREN inObamacare!?
Biplane adverts, too. # Action4Democracy
I have a song, I'd like to help fuel your fire and sing to you...you may just need the insight I carry.
Is it true the Senate finance office is counting calls for public hearings. If so, is there a number we call for this?
Inquiring minds want to know.
Maybe fellow Californians can pen a song about how health care matters for all/esp here/6th largest economy in world. @Beyonce @katyperry ??
We need a song!
I'm no good with songs, but I do an excellent job writing.
@GOP @HOUSEGOP @SENATEGOP @AARP @AARPFL
The problem is we keep trying to save the wealthy instead of av. citizens. Med admin is bloated by ins'rs & plans
Question:  Are you in favor of 'single payer health care'  please -  yes or no !  Thank you.
It's the plan that has had the most consistent results worldwide. I hope so.

Thank you for sharing this. I may link back to it in the upcoming weeks as we fight. Here's something for you.
Please people stay courageous, strong and fight we have to unite and help save our healthcare a& our democracy!  We cannot become complacent
I think you'd like this.
Yeah, cause singing a song will pay the bills...
Exactly! Fed healthcare should be abolished; it has NO PLACE in the U.S. Government!!!!!!!!!
That's losing talk. Fight back. Join me in my one woman war against politics as usual. Today's post:
@LaurensComedy I think she means you.
we will never have universal healthcare if we continue to spend 55% of the national budget on Defense.
We actually spend more money than any other nation on earth. There is no reason we can't reallocate those funds.
Why are we the only "modern" country in the world still wrestling / debating Health care? We are a pathetic excuse for modernization!!
We really are.
We need to be nice to one another.  How is that for health care?
There are far more practical reasons. We overpay while the system we have under-delivers. Read my blog.

Maybe telling them that the government wants to take 20+ million people off life support will make them listen
Or this
#letsgetit
Never gonna happen ...
And why does your small mind think this?
Well sir, like most politicians they're beholden to those who keep them in power & pay them off...and unfortunately, that's not you.
That's going to have to change. I've started my one woman war on politics as usual. Join me. Today's post here:
REPEAL Oba ma care. I am your constituent.
#singlepayer #ditchbigpharma
The biggest problem? Admin of so many plans & ins'rs. Overpaying is 2nd.
U.S. is still the only major country in the  w/o universal healthcare.

CA was close, but Dem @Rendon63rd blocked #SinglePayer #SB562
*is* close, is close to universal healthcare.Speaker Rendon can still #releasethebill from Rules Committee. Please calll him 916-319-2063 :)
Keep fighting. I'm giving you tools. USE THEM!
They're too busy talking about Trump's tweets & Morning Joe & CNN.
Trump loves diversions and has to keep himself front and center in the news. He is the Show Man, and loves attention.
He's appealing to the low life bar brawler s that's for sure. They love the gutter stuff.
A Great Chant is 
Health Care 
No
Wealth Care    #HealthCareNotWealthCare  Go!

Healthcare is not a right it's a privilege we pay for get the government out now
Yes, so we can continue to have the most admin heavy, wasteful system in the world!
Contemplating. I'm clever. I will see if I can come up with a good one and use it as a title of an upcoming blog post.
As hard as it was to pass Obamacare, once repealed it won't be passed again. Reform not repeal. Pass bill that will give healthcare to more
Here are some ideas for reforms based on evidence.
How about just vote to replace O-care so my family is not forced to pay $1800 per mo with $15000 deductible 
We need to take lessons from other countries. Our system is the most inefficient one in the industrialized world.
Complete repeal coming your way. #MAGA love me some POTUS
Ha ha good one. These liberals are melting
Well, for once you actually came up with something new. You still have a ways to go before you are at the Scottish level of insults.
There is more strength in numbers . Charge everyone a fare single payer rate. #theneverendingstory
CA has an opportunity for single-payer in #SB562 - Kamala & other CA Dems are NOT supporting it even with a Dem supermajority. #Bought
There is no funding. Read about it via David Daren. It would be great but it isn't possible for various reasons. It needs to be federal.
We pay more than every other country on earth. Ins admin. is the problem, not $
History tells us the only way a democracy survives a authoritarian takeover is w/civil disobedience. ACA repeal is part of that takeover.
Absolutely right! We need to dump Obamacare outright and return health insurance to the free market where it belongs.

As effective in your position as ever... why not whistle?!
Call the traitor McConnell who is responsible for both the election of Trump and taking away your healthcare!
It health insurance choices. Health care has nothing to do with it.
Unfortunately our representatives are there only to make deals and to enrich their pockets they don't give a rats ass about us. TERM LIMITS
Healthcare is not "your stuff". Anything given to someone by the government was STOLEN from someone else.
This is EVIL!
Trump administration proposes eliminating crucial program that helps low-income people pay for heat in winter. http://trib.al/CHzJMl4 
Those who rely on state will pay a price far greater than what it provides. A new slavery is the end result. Careful what you clamor for.
Amen!
Yes I just sent you a letter Senator. Please reply back asap. I am living in the state of Mississippi. I am going to send it out to soon
RUN DOWN POLS AT 4TH OF JULY MARCHES! TOWN HALL MEETINGS! HOMES! GO TO EM! GO MAKE ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS GO GO GO!!!!!!!!
@smartgirls4gop It WILL be nice to have private health insurance again, but you can sing if you want.... 
plz help us help that baby you are big time plz retweet #savecharlie
Sing a song??
ABSOLUTELY. The ppl make changes. Its all up to the ppl. The ppl who r affected by the policies their elected reps conjure up need to ACT.
Sing. Sing a song. Sing out loud. Sing out strong. Sing of Healthcare for All. Sing of bridges, not walls. 

#SaveTheACA #Healthcare4All
Fantastic and inspiring seeing you at Harbor UCLA Med Ctr today. Keep up the good fight!  #resistanceispatriotic   Happy 4th of July!
If DMX sung a song about this health care situation it'd probably sound like this.  #ACHA #ObamaCared
#TrumpCareTen got me callin' my reps and making this #HipHop song re: CALLING YOUR REPS!  #NoACHA #HealthcareBill https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlTnqzxMyjg …

#Repealdontreplace
Please please run for higher office Senator Harris- we'll start making the signs!!
Health care is too important an issue for the people of the United States to lose. The Republican bills are a loss for the people.

people also need to know the facts about the ACA decline...it's spelled Trump and the Republicans creating uncertainty in the Ins. and Trump
You mean instead of being distracted by nut job tweets from the @WhiteHouse ? Got it!
Lead on Senator
Who can I call to get unscrewed by Obamacare?

Dissapointed to hear about @SenSchumer partying w/Kushner/Ivanka/Koch brother, when ACA is on the line.
I really hope you will consider running in 2020!
Yes Ma'am
May I suggest, if you're doing weekly addresses online can you link them here? Or a weekly live feed for 30 min? We want to follow you.

There is a dishonest party.... The #Trump Administration. Lies,  conspiracies, insults  & distractions are their currency
This has to be priority one for the citizenry at this point. Let Mueller carry the investigation forward until ACA repeal is dead dead dead
Rally today in Hendersonville NC
And whistle Dixie.
Sen. Harris, thank you for representing the interests of the people
I'm singing Dr. Feelgood!
Sorry, but when I sing people NEED healthcare...  But I'll do anything else!
Healthcare for dummies (as simple as it gets):

ACA = OBAMAcare 
AHCA/BCRA = #DonTcare 
#wealthcare
#gopDOESNTcare
#tRumpCOMPLICIT
You go Kamala!!!
What kind of song do you want me to sing?
Why?
The tweet was get out sing march abt healthcare!! So I asked what you wanted me to sing? Got my phone fixed!!!
So you don't support the #AHCA ?
I need to look at all new insurance!! Obamacare is gone!! No saving it!!! At this point can't fix it!!
Then why bother asking the question about what to sing?
I am as being funny  no sense of humor today!!
That wasn't remotely funny. And I know funny!
Word of advice. No E-mails.
Yes, agree,do whatever it takes!!!
Perhaps #25thAmendmentNow would be a good topic for discussion.
Bernie + Kamala in 2020
I just had surgery on my leg this morning but I will be there in spirit.
I'm loving your focus and your clarion voice, Senator.
I went to a D.O. for back pain but he was more concerned with BP, BS and Cholesterol. My back still hurts. #FaultySystem Fix what hurts.
RESIST
Songs have always mattered on the protest line. Let's all use the same short playlist and bring out the drums and guitars!
You guys should be happy, the ACA is falling apart.  Most of what he GOP is proposing are reforms that keep he ACA alive.
Trump's tweets are official statements. Let's call them that. "The President stated that he wanted to fistfight someone from CNN."
#25thAmendmentNow #FixACA
2. To lose, they will act! Like they have nothing left to lose!! That can't / won't end well for anyone!!
1. This whole situation is / has devolved into a class war and the divide is growing daily. Once people feel like they have nothing left....
Where was this call to action as ACA has left 10's of Millions without healthcare? It's agenda for you, not actual lives that matter.
Whatever you feel will work, health care is so important.
I've called daily. Every office of Sen Portman
#GOP = #GreedOverPeople #OustEvilGOP #AHCAKills aka #DeathCare aka #Wealthcare #AmericaNeedsMedicare4All like #HR676 #No2TrumpCare
IMPEACH
Healthcare is being worked on after the mess you helped make.
You are intelligent, articulate tell ppl True History of USA. What started in Va.during Brown vs Board of ed.Please ppl need facts.
I hope Kamala Harris runs for President 2020.  Come on already we need you!!!
All of this is not new.  People were already being neglected in the USA.
You are not so smart my dear, who took away our healthcare of wait the democrats. So go sing a song.
I'm surprised ppl feel the need to celebrate the 4th of July at all. It should be a day of mourning.
@Lin_Manuel maybe can help us with the song part?

and not forget our independence and those who fought to gain it...
I'm sorry, I don't understand. Who doesn't know about health care? Our senators? THEY JUST DON'T CARE.
#twittertownhall #freedomtocare #righttocare
@RedTRaccoon
twitter handles for GOP senators:
#25ammendmentnow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyPDMXjDfqA …  Here is an excellent song for our times.  Written some time ago, especially appropriate now.
I've got the song:
https://g.co/kgs/3gRtpB 
This is our week of independence and americas bday. This week we must impact. Not willing to wait til 2020
The GOP senators already know Americans hate this. They don't care and don't represent the will of the American people.
Please pass legislation requiring all political representatives, inc. the President, to pass US citizenship test before allowed on ballots.
Thank you for continuing to push and fight, and being inspirational, in advocating for the what's right for everyone, not just one party.
President Harris.
There's a great Beatles tune you could sing: "I'm a loser."

You should be working with republicans to fix this Obamacare mess!  You are being paid by US citizens to do your job! Do your JOB!!
Do you only support your constituents that get FREE medical from Gov't?  What about those that can't afford it, Lost insurers,Pay penalties?
#resistbot Text 50409 & it will fax your representatives for you. For example
Unfortunately, the sycophant GOP doesn't care about any resistance. Our only hope is to start the campaign now to #votethemOUT
now completely distracted by auditioning songs in my head
Lives In the Balance comes to mind
Yes we do!
Please do some crazy, peaceful stuff to get news coverage. Stunts galore!

Did McConnell send another bill to be scored? It was reported yesterday
People need to get out at these anti-Trump marches with congressional contact info and have people act by emailing, tweeting, calling, etc
If I sing a song people will need health care, Senator.
Keep the pressure  on ..good job ! Kamala
Indeed  sensable patriotism #BringBackAmerica  is my Message ,Be heard
Ok- I will sing a song about the death of Obamacare. It will be a country song I think.#repeal&replace.
#25thAmendmentNow #25thAmendmentNow #25thAmendmentNow #25thAmendmentNow #25thAmendmentNow #25thAmendmentNow #25thAmendmentNow #25thAmendment
How about the government staying out of healthcare--they done a good job of nearly ruining it!
No one wants to hear me sing, but I hear there's a new artist .@AnnieLennox ! #LoveLennox #EurythmicsRules #80sChild
Definitely!!
Protesting is thirsty work. Your sisters down under are with you this July 4th! Brewed by women. Made for everyone. @marksoulos @newmatilda
I'm an artist and poet..holla.
The Doors "this is the end?" Or the skillet lifters "run nigger run?"
Lets not forget about homelessness and the housing crisis in the bay area. SOS....
When are you running for president? We need someone like you to lead.
We want to repeal and replace obamacare with single payer. There, easy. But you have got no spine. Too busy raking up those pharma dollahs!
Call call call#TheResistance
I will do all of the above.
Harris / Warren. 2020
#singlepayer is what we need in America. Both parties need that in platform or soon they will not be elected. Please say something on #SB562
http://bit.ly/2s6nq9V 
Yes to songs! Also calls, but Imma get to work on that song = )
If ppl don't march in the streets they will destroy our lives
The risk is the movement dies down over 18 mos. But DT's stupidity will help the effort if we all survive. #ImpeachTrump @robreiner
U need to run for President
Get Federal Gov. OUT of healthcare. No Socialism for USA.
Any senator voting 'yes' will b drop kicked in2 political oblivion sooner rather than later. The smart (ahem ) ones know this already
I propose a dance off 
Kamilia Im smart tell me where 2 go next b 4 he pulls it breaking laws yes but im coming 2 u 4 help ive done my hardest by standin up 2xs nw
There is attention about healthcare. FYI- It's a movement called #MedicareForAll
Health insurance and health Care are two separate things. Not that you'd be honest enough to admit that.
What if he tries to remove it now we have no chance 2 debate its gone lost 2 wth? Where do they find THESE people i must ask It will b worse
Are you personally going to be out there?? Pink vagina hat or in clad black?
I'm losing my insurance at year end due to the stupidity you're peddling. Get government out of insurance.
I took it on to challenge this mess but if he moves against  us nw we hv to recourse our legal grounds by pass is a no no! 30 mins ago hecal
if democrats don't block it maybe it can be repealed and replaced.ATTN: voter.
I moved to motion the CBO scoring, I took tht stand on fbk will i get tht chance? Repeal now will only hurt us all bt a chance 2 fight bk!
You rock @KamalaHarris
Reading Washington  post he wants it done now How crazier  can it be? Pulling it now will be a bigger mess Don't do that!  Hw do you deal w?
Don't Stand down!
How can we get the GOP to do their jobs? We write, tweet, call, march and they ignore us. Meanwhile they r dismantling our govt #Fascism
Got it!  Thank you... will let the people know.
La la la la la Obamacare failing.
What can be done to get @realDonaldTrump out of office right now? We The People have had enough. We don't feel safe at home.
I'll see you in Carson tomorrow, @SenKamalaHarris!
#GOPHealthcareIsMurder #Wealthcare We must fight to #ProtectOurHealthcare #SaveAmericanLives #SaveCare #SaveACA #Resistance
Sing a loud song, very loud.
Politicians only act as they can. They need to fear our votes. Means we have to vote. Even when it seems fruitless.
.Actually Senator, we need to talk to our friends and neighbors. Ask them if we are headed toward Greatness. Correct courses as needed.
 We shall overcome one day
Listen to your damn constituents and do what they ask you to do. #SinglePayer no more platitudes. Represent
Please get rid of this crazy president this is wrong and not American
#SinglePayer #SinglePayerNow
And remind people of this:"http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/6/kamala-harris-california-ag-behind-daleiden-raid-s/ …
Skip the songs, football spikes, and "can you believe he...". Doesn't go over well. You guys should display a most serious/sober demeanor.
You are amazing..dont stop..we need you...love your work.. #resist
Loooooove Kamala Harris!
Thinking of my healthcare song melody!
Fight for #Medicare4All
justice system also ...
.@SenKamalaHarris Trumps healthcare quote: If you had a job, you'd be to tired to be sick. #healthcarebill #heal
SINGLE PAYER!!
We need to also talk, march and demand the 2016 election be invalidated. New vote.
You should listen to what the people want rather than your donors so that you would be liked within the public a lot more around the US
@EWTN Family; USCCB,Convocation of Catholic Leaders, Orlando,Florida, Watched most of this SUNDAY, Sen.Kamala Harris, TRUTH TOGETHER

With prices like these, even 'GodCare' would be doomed to fail. 
#InsuranceMatters
What if all that is not enough, though? There are people affected by this that consider GOP Gods and are willing to DIE for their Gods. 
Good lord! #MedicareForAll is what America wants and deserves.  You serve only your corporate masters.
