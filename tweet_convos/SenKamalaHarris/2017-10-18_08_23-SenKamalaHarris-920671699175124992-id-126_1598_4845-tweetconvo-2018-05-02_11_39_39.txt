Please hold @sensanders to that standard. He's against our rights aka "identity politics", lies abt us daily, & gave Trump the WH. SHUN him!
ZZZZ ZZZZZ  He endorsed Hillary, what else do you want.  Those voters voted for him over Hillary and Trump, so your point is ZZZZZZZZZZZ
That tweet was 3 days before the election.
Sounds more like a Trump endorsement.
I think it sounds more like a last ditch appeal to win back voters that Hillary herself alienated by labeling them "deplorables"
He repeated it after the election, over & over, alongside his dismissal of civil rights (id politics), while chasing racists in WWC.
He was giving them the A-OK to vote as they did, 23% didn't vote HRC. It's not at all debatable. It's who he and Berners are.
Millions of her votes wouldn't have shown up if Bernie didn't get them interested.  Continue the divide.  That'll work facing trump in 2020
Wrong. That 23% was of BERNIE's primary voters. The rest were with HRC from the beginning. Because we are actual Democrats. And bc MATH.
Let's hope Americans take this heart in the local, state, and national elections coming up over the next 3yrs.
I think it's up to us to keep circulating FACTS AND TRUE STORIES about Trump to those who aren't getting the information through Fox news.
Please. Since when is disrespect a partisan problem?
That depends on your perspective. But either way, it needs to end. Someone has to lay down their weapons first. Leaders start. Lead. I will.
Black congresswoman getting on TV causing a riot for one black person she looks really stupid
Hey, that could very well be your next President. She's like a female Obama...and we ALL miss him so much...
You got to be on DRUGS
Only legal ones, dear.
Something is wrong with you people I'm from Massachusetts COUNT the VOTE lady TRUMP legally PRESIDENT
... Also rem that if they are a danger to others then they might also be a danger to you as well.
Yes, that is why I'm still in shock people voted for HIM. My heart is heavy to how much we will suffer for this. 
Or, like, the one thousand four hundred and twenty second time.
Exactly Senator......exactly.
I DID believe #Trump, all the way back in the 80's.  He was, is, always will be a total piece of shit! #TrumpResign #ResistanceUnited
This is an absolute truth!
Apparently trumpanzees haven't learned this lesson.
Nor the Super-Absorbent Trumpons.
Lmao
How did we miss this Proclamation?
Hello dear
So true because the 1st time one makes an excuse will lead to the 2nd...3rd to justify the behavior.
How can we arrange a setting where you and @SenAlFrank can interview #Sessions?
It would make a killing on PayPerView

Yep...
That's why when I tweet you on your birthday about being as old as Julia Sugarbaker, you remember I'm old, and I eat the cookies all up.
No truer words spoken...now let's discuss your record in Ca and your agenda then.
I’m so glad I read “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sing” when I was 18 because Maya was a huge influence for the rest of my life!
So true
Bugger off Harris!  You're rotten to the core.
DTrump told us...I’m more frightened of the folks who voted for him
I did not do this. I paid dearly. Don’t be like me. Listen to this advice
@flywithkamala Why are you not going to Detroit????
She will be in Rhode Island campaigning for @SenWhitehouse on Oct 27th and keynoting the @HRC Nat’l Dinner on Oct 28th.
@SenWhitehouseLove Sen.Whitehouse but Women should stand for Women at these special occasions...
Trump  will NEVER change.
No, and that's only part of why he should go. He should be tried for crimes he committed before becoming POTUS and while serving as POTUS.
The watchword of last year’s election, which was ignored by way too many people.
My absolute fave quote frm one of my favorite human beings...this quote has NEVER failed me @DrMayaAngelou. Thanks for sharing it Ms Harris
True Trump his cabinet is all racists and thieves
I didnt,now I live alone.

NEW: After a soldier was killed, President @realDonaldTrump offered his family a $25K check. Then he didn't pay.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/world/national-security/trump-offered-a-grieving-military-father-25000-in-a-call-but-didnt-follow-through/2017/10/18/8d4cbc8c-b43a-11e7-be94-fabb0f1e9ffb_story.html …

Mi reina. Muy love  bella. Del alma  inteligente brillante  te. Quiero mucho  estaré siempre pata estar contigo cuida

The @GOP has been showing us who they are for 40+ years, and we keep showing the world who we are by electing them to represent us.
We love you Kamala
Words I live by!!
You showed us who u were when u were bribed into not prosecuting Mnuchin or ExxonMobil. Shut up.

So once a criminal always a criminal?
I ABSOLUTELY AGREE!! The problem lies within the society that wants one to turn a blind eye. Elimination is very difficult for some to take.
@realDonaldTrump Resign!!!!!!

#Aliens #SpaceShip #PlanetX #Nibiru 
Yes I believe you are a communist
We see who you are, Sen.Harris, please run for president!

 #MayaAngelou #WednesdayWisdom
@PaulaJWinkel this is my favorite quote. “The First Time”
Or just go back and watch the GOP debates. Cause it was all there in plain sight  @marcorubio @JebBush @tedcruz @JohnKasich @ChrisChristie
says the slavery & prosecutorial misconduct defending senator? #NeverKamala
My pinned tweet. These words ring true! #MayaAngelou #libertyandjustice
"When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time." #MayaAngelou #truth #fridaythoughts 
IRONIC COMING FROM A FAKE ESTABLISHMENT DEMOCRAT WHO CHANGES HER VOTES FOR CAMPAIGN DONATIONS. #RESIST #RESISTANCE
You have shown us who you are.  And, CA now has a hepatitis epidemic.
He showed us when he mocked the reporter
He has certainly shown.
Hillary? Obama?
Yes.
Excellent quote.  Yet you've never let sex workers show you who they are. Don't assume you know what's best for them. Ask!
What a great quote from a brilliant woman.
So Trump showed us all during the campaign and still got elected somehow. This sometimes concerns me more than his behavior. How and why?
because the only other choice was hillarity clinton.....
Senator Harris, you are our hope for the future of our country.  We see who you are and we love you.  Thanks for all you do.
We seem to be having a nation wide problem with this at the moment.
Well said
I agree! Lock Hillary up!
Yes and we know exactly who you are, a woman who slept her way up the ladder with a married man. Shinning example of a home wreaker.
That guy in the WH showed who he was back in the 80's, and I believed then and still believe...that he's garbage.  #nomore45

This is dedicated to Trump, Sessions and all their friends.
I have lived by those words the first time I heard them. These are the words of wisdom I pass to my children and grands and all I influence.
Agreed where @HillaryClinton @BillClinton #JamesComey, #RodRosenstein #RobertMueller @POTUS44 are concerned with #UraniumOne #justsayin
Get that ass Senator.
YESSSS!MAAM

We do. That’s why we didn’t vote for Hillary- but you did and you gave us Trump. We tried to warn you but you didn’t listen. Smh.
Sage words from a great lady of letters.
First time I saw you is when you questioned Sessions at the hearing.  You were rude, disrespectful, and condescending.  So yes, I see you.
That is so true
Yes indeed
#sessions
Need you questioning Sessions all I can say, 
I love being reminded of Maya Angelou's wisdom. She reminds us of the truth within ourselves. The only sad part is we keep needing this one.
The American citizens should keep that in mind when politicians write/propose bills which are clearly unconstitutional & un- American?
Fox DELIBERATELY SUPPRESSES news & stories about Trump IN ORDER TO HIDE unflattering FACTS about his character and mislead viewers.
like msnbc does for democrats?
Yup!
Yep that’s why I can’t believe so many people voted for this tool. I knew exactly who DT was waaayy before he came into his present job
What did the lawyers say about Sessions skirting around his conversations with the President? Please tell us someone hired a lawyer to look
Believe me, somebody's already on it.
Lordy, it seems like some people don't believe it after the 2000th time.
"But if you can personally profit by ignoring, go for it".
- GOP 2017.
WE do.

10:24am.Just now @SenKamalaHarris 10:25am , watching @SenFeinstein on @CSPAN  Senate Judiciary Committee, TRUTH more☻
Apparently with POTUS some people seem to need at least a thousand times.
I live by those words. They have never been wrong for me.
Fighting against Trump for one negro that got killed in Nigeria well it's Democrats Benghazi again
Ain't that the truth
