Level playing? You mean like all those successful countries just prospering from government created level playing fields, like Venezuela?
Don't be a doofus. You cannot compare Title II to socialist governments. The reality is that companies like Verizon abused #NetNeutrality
give the facts...tweet the evidence
Verizon intentionally overloaded circuits that went to Netflix's switches. The Tier 1 ISPs who are neutral 3rd parties confirmed this fact.
http://ok.one  time.corrected..more evidence is need to allow hub porn sites to reign
Hahaha I know your agenda. I provided evidence. You're just a lunatic zealot that's obsessed with porn.
by the way, my Agenda is internet free from powers of google, FB, twitter globalists
Your agenda is to turn the internet into what you want it to be rather than an open place for everyone. You're a crusader.
No it doesn't.  The internet evolved under a non #NetNeutrality set of rules and will continue to do just fine.
*facepalm* we are under #NetNeutrality they want to remove it.
Yes.  But we've only been under it for a couple of years.
Still, do you want to have to pay extra to be able to visit for example twitter or youtube?
Free market.
You're lying! #NetNeutrality is #censorship for citizens, #FreeSpeech reserved for corporations & elite. #EndNetNeutrality
Do you have downs? Look into #NetNeutrality for even a second. Might want to see a doctor for that brain of yours
Personals attacks in place of a substantive argument or any argument. Standard #LiberalLogic.
Lmao liberals are retards so are conservatives #dolphinparty
Senator please vote NO on Wray, cannot be trusted, if Trump wants him. #Resist
Vote no on Wray.
Thank you Kamala Harris, not a fan of your stance on guns but I am a fan of your stance on Title II
How dare you? The GOP venerates small biz. They say it all the time. And by golly they mean it!
"A level playing field" - are you serious? Walmart & Amazon play evenly with Joe's Tank Top Shop?
Oh the Greedy: their new tagline… "If you can't afford the Internet you don't deserve the Internet?" That's not great branding.
We NEED more COWBELL 
and not all these bots sucking up bandwidth.
Than please propose legislation to do that instead of forcing FCC to twist ill-suited Title II classification. How it's supposed to work.
Speak up and out today.
true
How?
People need to contact the FCC, more so that their Representatives.
I support you!   Thank you
I usually think of free speech & consumers, be suppose there are those for whom that's meaningless.
We reject ur attempts at censorship
#NetNeutrality doesn't have any censor ship. Use your brain old man.
Yet you don't support free speech (because you use the term hate-speech) and you also don't support keeping the internet privatized.
#GLOBALIZATION! Good for All
No it is not - see http://pol-check.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/globalization-who-benefits.html … Internationalism must be controlled.
Please uphold net neutrality.
Too bad landlords won't even talk to us anymore because "self-employed implies illegality".
Why are Americans supporting something that hurts them and profits big business? Claim your personal power and VOTE for representation.
Would be an even more level playing field if one could take a chance on starting a business without losing their healthcare. (In MO) :(
What the 1% wants: An #Amazon-#Intranet replacing the #NetNeutrality: They realized that the Net ended the old opinion-manipulation!
#NetNeutralityDay #SaveTheNet
A level playing field? Is that why Amazon dominates the market?
Thank you Senator Harris.  I hope other #Senators #DoTheRightThing and fight for #NetNeutrality
It also allows us to RESIST!  GOP is against that?!  Sigh
You mean privilege over equality? You mean censorship over free speech?
Thank you, Senator Kamala Harris, for your support. Your vote to continue a free, neutral internet is impressive. #FCC #OpenInternet
Thanks Ms. Harris, also please vote yes today for the hearing aid bill. Many, many ppl need these. Thanks! Keep up the good work
You guys, @SenKamalaHarris get us!  What a dreamboat!
The genius of the internet is that it enables entrepreneurship on a level playing field. Rolling back #NetNeutrality threatens that.
NOTHING NEW HERE
LYING DEMOCRATS WHATEVER THEY CLAIM
IS ALWAYS THE OPPOSITE OF THE TRUTH!
#NetNeutrality is a Soros - Zuckerberg scam to control your data
All caps?  Someone isn't even believing their own lies.
Thank you!
Keep speaking out loud  even when cranky, old senators try to stifle you. 
Be the beacon of hope and change!
Here's an idea of what could happen if we lose #NetNeutrality
Like porn sites and pedo sites that sponsor your crusade
The genius of #NetNeutrality is that it is so easy to manipulate people, even a #librarian can do it! http://safelibraries.blogspot.com/2010/12/ala-pushes-net-neutrality-on-wikipedia.html …
Maybe if you supported Bernie this #NetNeutrality tweet wouldn't be necessary
And pay attention to the last page since Bernie has been consistently fighting for #NetNeutrality for years
I strongly believe the ploy of rolling back Net Neutrality is yet another method of weakening American institutions by 'those that fear us'.
We cannot allow the infection of capitalism ( greed ) to skew traffic on the internet. ensure #NetNeutrality
I wish we had you here in FL instead of Scott. Please consider a move?
It's also being done by an illegitimate appointee at FCC.
Please read
travesty is mismanagement of tax dollars,  unfair to tax payers while voting in raises for Reps & Senators yet no cola disabled seniors.
Insurance premiums hikes indicate we are no longer valued beyond paying for services WE CANT BENEFIT.  Another form of GERRYMANDERING!  HELP
How to write an impactful net neutrality comment (which you should definitely do) http://mashable.com/2017/06/15/how-to-write-a-good-fcc-comment/#T_tLH0PvLkO3 … #NetNeutrality
Let's Not go backwards but forward
Healthcare must allow appropriate non pharmaceutical- based options for the rest of us paying but no benefit whatsoever.  Cap ins co profits
Agreed!
OUST/ ARREST T ADMIN DUE TO POOR CHARACTER/ DECISIONS w/ ELECTION INTERFERENCE REPAIR w/ NEW ELECTION w/ YOUNGER, QUALIFIED CANDIDATES!
eyes roll

as if this sea hag cares

um ya right

u still here kam?
In deed it does.  Counting on you to represent us in stopping the rollback.
Scare tactics
Not to mention isps already have a monopoly nearly everywhere, how much power do they need? Aren't corporations already overpowered?
YES! your earlier this Wednesday morning Sen. Kamala Harris, Watching @CNN U.S. Senate JUDICIARY Committee Hearing;  10:00am  continued
Donald trump and his sons and son in law, should be.criminally prosecuted, in federal prison, for betrayals to our country, with russia
CORRECTION: read as INTERNET NOT INTEREST JM
Limiting interest in any way is stifling freedom of information & freedom of speech.  Factual News and ethics must follow highest standards
Isn't the whole idea of GOP economics to monopolize, dominate, control, eliminate competition with existing institutions?
Thank you for fighting back! (P.S. I love you)
Sexual harassment
That's not how that works Jeff
Oh absolutely it does, by feminist definition.
You must really enjoy spamming @SenKamalaHarris feed. Troll.
I suppose you wish to require an ID for all social media use because of it, right?
#CA4MAGA
Yup and to keep america great we gonna stop NN form changin
from*
It also allows morons to incriminate themselves. Bonus!
No #NetNeutrality is govt taking over more of our lives. Like healthcare in 2009 it works leave it alone b4 u fuck it up then we gota fix it
What needs to be looked at is PayPal & the way they ban people with no explanation or recourse.
the genius of the internet is that it makes it SOOO easy for progressives to look you up and see you got paid off to block #singlepayer
