More ppl uninsured NOW under OC than before OC. What u say about that? More working less hrs due to OC hours rule!
People need healthcare coverage that pays for prevention and treatment.  We all will get sick.  I say universal healthcare for every citizen
Not me, go back to how it was no one was refused treatment b 4 OC.
You are incorrect.  I worked in healthcare prior to  OC.  no free lunch! Non-emergent medical services had to be pre paid or were denied.
Not in NJ where ER was 99% Hispanic non English speaking.  Nurses came out and apologized to me & daughter nurse told us this. I believe her
Your ignorance is showing.  If you think getting free care in an ER is cure for Obamacare.
@criteria681 ditto 
How about u work, earn & pay 4 ur own ins. Able bodied ppl that could work but don't shouldn't be getting FREE HC on workers backs
The democrats crafted their big stinkburger called Obamacare in secret behind closed doors and most never even read the damn bill #stopthebs
you need to read up on what you are tweeting about rebel - it was on the floor for months regardless of how crafted
Read? What's that when one can get talking points from bigots and inbreds like Hannity and the likes
Oh yeah the party of pelosi reid Schumer and Warren they and their sheep i mean followers a real bunch of intellectuals! Baahaa!
The difference between us lies in the fact that I don't idolize the toxic people within the Democratic Party. Country over party line.
Well then you are a rarity because most Dems were happy to have a corrupt careless  liar lead the country #usefulidiots
That's not a secret.
Very serious question: Why do the wealthy need tax cuts?
Greed
But, that's not a legitimate answer. Not ethically legitimate, anyway.
Why penalize someone for being more successful than other people? What precedent does doing that make?
I don't think successful people should be penalized...but they should pay their fair share of taxes.
Trumps a successful billionaire business man. You don't think he knows what he's doing? You're naive.
Dems should publish a plan since they are being excluded. It would undoubtedly be superior and would make the Republican plan look... mean!
They just need to fix the parts of the ACA which was the plan with HRC. We don't need an entire new law/program.R's are even Corp premiums
Trump and the GOP wouldn't think of doing something HRC thought about doing. They are so self absorbed they would think it beneath them
Therein lies one--if not THE--greatest problem.
@SenatorBurr @SenThomTillis we know what you're doing. We see you.
This bill cannot pass! Make. Those. Calls. People. #mean
Kamala Harris and Diane Feinstein are my Senators. If ur Senator(s) are  consider phoning the above senator's. Use ur imagination, b polite
Such a lie.   Disappointing Senator.
lololol  yes.@SenKamalaHarris  THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IT DOES  cover fewer ppl and give tax cuts to the wealthy.  1st stage @DvlprExtrodinar ?
When are they going to get over with trickle down BS? Never worked  never will.
The real reason they did not reveal it: did not want to lose elections last night while their abomination is out for all to see.
Like the Obamacare bill was so transparent. You know the one you jammed down the throats of American ppl.
KEEP ON TWISTING THINGS, OR MAYBE YOUR THINKING IS TWISTED AND YOU CAN'T SEE STRAIGHT! OBVIOUSLY!
Go get 'em! We need your voice.
It's taking away Medicaid for Ashton! His antipsychotics are expensive,other meds too. He's severely autistic, can't talk, it's bad enough!
You can't say that, how could you possibly know, Wait till it is released, pass judgement then
It was announced
I know that, but it hasn't got out yet, Obviously
Nope not the hidden plan. Still think health for America would be better investment!
how can it be secret when all you have done is lie about it.Obamacare they had to pass it to see what was inside.that was kept a secret
Why did obamacare have to be voted on before anyone could see what was in it?
When Obama Care was passed Speaker Nancy P said "We have to pass the bill to know what's in the bill."  Why all the stink this time?
Indeed apparently they are ready after my 30 years of social work care paying taxes to send me and my disabled child to poverty or death.
Thank you for pointing that out. They want to fuck over the very people who voted for them
Well, they keep voting for them election after election...they deserve all they get. No sympathy from me.
That is a point and a valid one.
Who doesn't know this?
As opposed to Obamacare where they had to sign the bill 2 see what was in it?! Which was ^premiums, ^deductables, etc etc! Ad nauseam !
They have no heart, just greed! I worry for my children and grandchildren! I would not bring children into this corrupted world today! Sad!
That's not a secret
Agreed. The pubs shouldn't do anything , just leave the ACA alone and let it collapse.
Dems created it; U DEMS  are responsible for it.
#WealthCarePureAndSimple
Duh.
Share this with your Republican Co-workers
Thank g-d, GOP leadership!  In advocating so well for your wealthy donors, you have chosen the issue that will lead to your demise.
You forgot to blame Russia this time...what happened to that fairytale?
It's not even a healthcare bill.  It's a tax cut bill disguised as a healthcare bill. Sad.
And people will die! How can they sleep at night?!
Still waiting for your brilliant elucidating observation!
We all kinda figured that out as soon as repeal and replace the ACA became a platform.
It's the first third of the bill! They aren't even hiding it!
Hey Kamala, the Democrat Health Care Plan was a secret, too. Your Dishonesty makes you part of the problem! Drain the Swamp!
Blablabla talking points - no facts.
You nailed it 
Shit we all knew that. Why did they have to keep that secret?
This isn't a #Healthcare Bill this is a #TaxCut bill for Billionaires
Shocker!
What's the real reason democrats didn't give us single payer?
you liar!  Keep it up, fueling class warefare and hatred. Stay focused; the ACA is almost insolvent and imploding. Blame the Dems, Senator
Donald said everyone would be covered. Unfortunately he failed to mention they would be covered in dirt.
Well then I guess it's no secret
Not exactly a secret though is it.
The Dems kept it under wraps to or did you forget that. They crammed it down our throats without really knowing what was in it.
Please run for President
If you only had a brain!
True
Hey friends in the U.S. these are your government officials; hold them accountable.
Right, like the dems did with that monstrosity of a disaster called ACA
Why can't every day working people that have gone Republican over the last few decades understand this? It is ALWAYS: Republican = Rich
Im counting on you and i think u shd head the Dems.  No disrespect to polosi +chuck, but we need a strong leader AND A MESSAGE. thx
I'm not sure that's a secret at all. I believe it is called GOP standard operating procedures.
You mean like Nancy Pelosi pushing a healthcare on christmas eve
They're just taking a page from the Pelosi handbook.
is there really nothing that can be done why is this country not revolting where are our leaders?
Americans are sheep. Offer them a choice of 1K types of cereal, & they will ignore every basic necessity being stolen under their noses.

To  state the obvious...
Greed over People!
commend u 4 truthapeaking leadrship! #Trumpcare = AFIB: American Family Illness & Bankruptcy Act
Legislators, insurers and persons who justify cutting Medicaid for the disabled based on sustainability should have their insurance revoked.
Expose it for what it is. It's not a health care bill. It's a tax cut bill that is funded by taking healthcare away from ordinary Americans.

Same shit, different day.
It's always plain n simple with the Repubs ..it's never complicated with them from healthcare, taxes to voter suppression.. wake up ppl!!
Yup!!
That is the only way, and, Pass it in a vote right down @GOP Party line.
It's a Wealthycare bill
Well, there you have it.
Please stop this #Heartless & #Mean #TrumpNoCare bill. Voters want Healthcare for All that includes essential care, no caps, #MakeACABetter
Please alll Dems fight fight fight back back.  Don't sit. Please do it !!!!
Time to fight! No more nice Democrats I'm tired of it!
Fight them Kamala, please

We're all counting on you

I'm so proud of my vote for you
So you read the whole Bill already? A day before it's released?
Obama's team did the same...relax
Unfortunately Trump supporters will not read the bill and all they will hear is what GOP says and they will only see Dems as obstructionist
When your done reading the bill let us know.
They will screw around & threaten us with it. If they R stupid enough to pass it now none of them them will be reelected in 2018.
Any Republicans left after the 2018 elections will wipe us out& take everything from the middle class & hand it to the wealthy on a platter
So I say PASS IT NOW REPUBLICANS! Let the voters see what your real agenda is!
It's a positioning tactic. They are crafting their dream sheet bill, knowing that they will have to compromise, then call it success.
Washington needs another Women's March IMMEDIATELY
Peaceful protesters being humiliatingly removed by disgusting NAZI cops and security guards. They just got rid of press camera.
Cops now looking through crowd looking for lighter people to carry out of the building by their arms and ankles.  DISGUSTING!
And destroy America's safety net! Medicare is put under a plan to eventually make it insolvent! & older republicans are just standing by...
What' are your suggestions? Only hear complaints!!
#Deathcare The one provision that does not change is a tax cut of millions for millionaires instead of healthcare for millions.
that's the truth
I'm a Californian. Please stop this bill and, especially, have all the Dems highlight and publicize all the tax cuts & who benefits (DJT).
Don't you feel bad creating those untruths?
Also allows insurers to boost premiums for people with pre-existing conditions. Phases out extra funds for the poor and disabled.
Do you receive this poor white people? He helps the WEALTHY.  This means WEALTHY blacks, ASIANS, etc., come before you.
Poor whites needed 2 team w/poor blacks 4 a candidate 2 help them both. Instead, RACISM made poor whites shoot themselves in the foot!
It's the beginning of their destruction of society.
My cat could do a better job with the healthcare bill then the lazy/greedy GOP
140+ pages of text of the #AHCA. First order, #TAX cut. I think this recon bill doesn't truly repeal #ACA, true?
https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/SENATEHEALTHCARE.pdf …
Senator, you rock. That is all.
Watch SENATOR Roberts,  does he know where he is.
Please stop the bill.
I guess we have to pass to see what's in it.
We know this...but we can't give the HUGE BRIBES...so they don't care. #TheResistance #DeathCare2017
I'm amazed they let you tweet this without interrupting you and telling you that you were being hysterical.
Seniors not working don't need tax cuts lol. They need eye, dental, and medical. Quality care and coverage.Hey kids get the basement ready.
Of course they do, they only care about the rich. Oh, and themselves. Please help us, keep fighting.
Apparently, their constituent base is fine with getting screwed, just as long as someone unlike them is screwed harder!
And..... caps on drugs, pre-existing conditions. Horrid quality care but hey lower premiums . We gonna die early and in pain
Why can't we do something about this?
These lies are why Dems will continue to lose!!!
Yes indeed Ms President, agree wholeheartedly
Sadly the GOP rank and file will go along with this.
Shocker. 
What was the reason for democrats to lie about the ACA?
I just don't understand why the Republican voters want to give this huge tax cut to the rich... it seems like they don't even want the facts
Where was our $2500 in savings from Obamacare?
Remind me again how much of a bipartisan effort Obamacare was and how it was passed?  I'll wait....
You're Absolutely right, they need to finance their Tax Breaks and need to offset the spending, so take 1/2 Trillion dollars from ACA.
I seem to remember this lady named Pelosi telling us we had to pass the bill to see what's in it.....pot, meet kettle
You said it Kamala !!" Grr
You said it.
Pay attention to Rep Tim Ryan @DNC is not paying attention. Huge  spent on elections. No results!
American ppl are not bright enough to clean themselves after bathroom. Look at VETS. Trump betrayed cut disability to 335,000 VET. yet love
Prop-47 Kamala Harris - Just say NO to socialist healthcare
"without a way to pay its $400-billion tab"
I'm confused. I thought those were pillars of the plan, not secrets.
Totally Agree. BUT we need honor the fact that is what Trump supporters and GOP want and were elected. So let them do it. PPL will see
Who would've guessed?!
Exactly
They do not want it to have to go back to the house
The only question for the GOP: how bad can the healthcare plan suck and yet still manage to pass?
Can someone publicly ask McConnell how they justify huge tax breaks for the rich.
That's not a secret
Why isn't no1 BLAMING INSURANCE CO. as well! They like #GOP=HATE r JUST for FILLING their POCKETS $$$ NOT caring about We The PEOPLE!
Why was the Democrat's ACA bill a secret?
If Dems do not prevail in 2018 and trump is re elected, I think you can kiss this already severely weakened democracy good bye.
Proof that this president has no regard for non rich
Obviously
They are preparing a Trillion $ tax break to the top 1% income earners. Doing this by taking away HC from millions. #ResistGOPBullshit
Then they have no reason to keep it a secret - we all already know that. #Resist
The 2 goals are unrelated though. The Repubs are determined to reduce govt benefits but cost isn't the issue.
Of course, that's why no healthcare bill is better then this bill. We would be better off on our own.
 And this would make med. costs crash.
There's a steep price to pay for that either way this turns out.
Funny thing about lies. That always come back to bite you in the ass. By all means Kamala keep it up. Winning is fun.
That's a secret like saying spoiler alert and then describing a porno. We know how it ends how do we avoid waking up broke sticky and sore?
You said earlier it was because the were racist and hated people?  Make up your mind.
We have yet to see the evil from this Government. Something big is coming that will reshape our country. It doesn't look good.
Tax cuts for the wealthy is job 1 for the GOP.
No! Say it ain't so, Joe! Say it ain't so!
That's no secret.
Very true . Nothing but lies & deception with #republicans and then we have the #huge  issue white cops murdering blacks & no #convictions
There is a storm comin'...it won't be pretty...and everyone's gonna get wet on this one...No prayers for Congress...
How do I forward this to #notmypresident Dump?
It's not a health care bill it's a deficit funded tax  cut
harris democrat have big problem With The Evil Evil party Republicains  with  president The Russia guy is winning winning
But it can't be right. Trump is anti-establishment... and anti-rich people and anti-himself
Blah, blah, blah.  You communists need a new line to feed your clapping seals.  That one is as tired and worn out.
Wow, hypocritical much? Fuck the GOP, but your party was the one who said, we must pass ACA to see what is in it!
Kamala you are the centrist candidate not connected to the hip of the DNC. I view you  as your own affiliation with the truth left or right
RIGHT ON
You know better than that!
The real reason: the dirty dozen plus one have a "Friends Bill" that covers their rich friends only. @GOP don't know how to write any plan.
Then explain why my annual premium is $26,600 with a 10k deductible. #kamalaharrisfakenews
it/s a total shame....akin to "slow genocide" in so-called Third World countries... except US supposed to be the leader of the Free World !
To quote #NancyPelosi "you have to read it to know what's in 
it"
I disagree. The real reason is that they don't care and are doing what they want throwing procedure and process to the wind
Hey, both can be true; and both are unconscionable
My #Senator Kamala,

#GOP #TrumpCare
will #genocide #White #Working #Families

@realdonaldtrump #polls #impeachment
The real reason the Republican health care bill is a secret: they want to cover fewer people & give tax cuts to the wealthy.
Trump just said he has such a plan we will pay NOTHING & better coverage. WOW!!Aren't you excited!!
Then he said "Nobody knew how complicated healthcare was."
Both sides want the same thing in the end to riddle away middle class debt & dependency thads both parties goals for the American ppl
We need to listen to @JoyAnnReid and stop trying to convert Trump supporters. The R's actually want this so we need a real plan of action.
And to keep women from having a say. It's a misogynistic health care bill!
I can't wait for the Righters to compare Trumpcare to Obamacare and start blaming Trumpcare on the Dems ! #YouKnowTheyWill
Population control w/no accountability toward leadership comes to mind, but let me use my indoor nonthreatening lady tone & say, "you right"
No secret there.
Duh
They really can't afford showing it to thier base.
