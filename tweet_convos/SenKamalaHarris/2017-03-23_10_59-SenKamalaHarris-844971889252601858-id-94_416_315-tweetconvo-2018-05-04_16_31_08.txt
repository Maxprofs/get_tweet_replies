@Only4RM It won't matter. We have confidence that you & others will vote it down in the Senate #Resist #GodCan
You might get a rude awakening then if it passes the House & GOP go a route requiring only 50 votes.
Which is what will happen.

@CrabQ @SenKamalaHarris
Would. Not will. Let's hope the House kills it NOW.

sure - premiums would go down a bit but insurers will sell plans that don't cover anything
I would argue the premiums won't go down. They were skyrocketing b4 OCare.

@CrabQ @Only4RM @SenKamalaHarris
that's true-and b4 ACA people didn't know they had junk health insurance until it was too late
SOOOOO..... What's the point of having any insurance at all??
So basically, it's healthcare without the health part or the care part. Plus a bonus Ponzi scheme part.
We own our home, but know ppl who have lost theirs. Medical care is expensive. Pay dr's & nurses well, not insurance execs!
Is anything covered? I mean that seems to be everything you would need isurance for.
If they pass this bill, we need to REFUSE to sign up. It's not going to be worth the money. Premiums that cover nothing & tax breaks to CEOs
@CourtPencil what the hell health benefits come with insurance then....geeze
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS_DTrump  ***IS ANY OF THIS TRUTH ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE BILL??? #GOD'CHRIST-JESUS#HELP US ALL,AMEN.
@CourtPencil So, we would be making a better financial decision to just get insur 4 r pets and pray for r good health...
#FakeNews   more liberal fear mongering
Factually, no. But keep telling your dependents that.. I mean, your constituents
so what would it cover? There is no point in having insurance if it does nothing for me.
@ShepardWill They really are so stupid.
What's left??
so what would it cover? Will will just be handing the insurance company money for nothing
They are not well.
NO
holy macaroni , do they really hate us that much? Whats left to actually cover?
My wife and I can't have any more kids. Explain why I have to have (and pay for) maternity coverage?
Nope. They'd put it on the states to define. Exactly how constitution intended
What the hell is left to cover? This is just nuts!
This is why: They don't care if people live or die (comment fr. a conservative blog).
Jesus Christ Kelly.... I mean, I KNEW this is how they feel, but damn to put it out there... @SenKamalaHarris @samquinones7
Sounds like "Death Panels on Steroids!"
Well then what the hell does this health plan cover? Doctor visits? They must think we are stupid!!
it just is so scary that the Republicans care so little for their fellow human
unbelievable 
At this point it would be better to be a cash patient
this is insane! This plan keeps getting worse and worse
thank you for reporting this! #resist!
How does one even CALL IT "health insurance" w/o these coverages? Oh, I know... when one lacks ANY CONSCIENCE! @SenKamalaHarris @hawks4evah
After those are gone, what's left?
I notice giving people Viagra/Cealisis etc weren’t on that list?
Seriously? Perhaps it would b best 2 let it pass, then watch the shit hit the fan! Not really….the cost of such would b 2high
My God! What will it cover? This is a sham, and proof that this administration lied to its own constituents!
"Optional". Means I choose what I need. What... I'm not capable of deciding that? #uaintmymommy
@realDonaldTrump what the hell IS covered???
.@SenKamalaHarris Please REPEAL OBAMACARE. Disastrous that families have NO CHOICE of doctor/plan & triple digit premium & deductible hike!
This destroys all main provisions of the Obamacare. This is insane! Trump supporters would lose coverage, too!!!
so then we're left with...basically nothing? We'll be paying more more way less? Fuck that.
Please do everything you can to see that this appalling, hateful denial of service to all Americans GOES DOWN IN FLAMES #SaveTheACA
What's left? Will their "insurance" be required to cover _anything_?
So just what does this crap bill cover? If it only covers doctor visit for common cold, WTF good is it?
Yup. If passed, and I'll bet it won't get through Senate. Big blowback in 2018. GOP painted in2 corner.
last minute will be last rights for millions
so no healthcare period. Disgraceful. Thank you 4 resisting. Keep it up. BTW, if this passes, I will probably die.
so it's blank paper..... uh okay...
omfg do they want to kill us off?  They want to #MakeAmericaSickAgain #SaveACA #NoOnTrumpCare
*meds
those things ARE health insurance! What's the point if: no Dr. No Ned's. No labs. No insulin pump, halter monitor, nothing!
You mean pretty much everything anyone actually needs and could use. Got it. #SaveACA
@DianaHollins So... what's left to cover? Their Viagra? #LyinGOP #SaveACA
This is horrifying. @HouseGOP @freedomcaucus are heartless enemies of Americans! They will suffer in 2018!
So basically, no healthcare for your expensive healthcare insurance.
@WiccanMethusela Because it not a healthcare bill it's a tax giveaway to the top 2%.
So, umm...what DOES it cover?
What is left? This is horrible!
So you pay premiums for  bugger all cover.
No. Not acceptable.
I think the Repubs may want to really reconsider eliminating mental health care...
Start from scratch and re-do without the mind set of screwing people over. So shameful the way they lie and govern
what kind of hell is this???
#trumpcare #GOPshame - they rushed it, it is a disaster that ryan and team are fully aware of #tumpcarenocare
Why, in the richest country on the face of the Earth, do we need to battle for the basics of life? This is out of control.
Thank you speaking out so strongly!
We just need to shut down this whole thing, postpone this illegitimate administration!
what's left after you take away those essential benefits?
That's the entire health benefit lol wth?
@GOP so what, exactly is left that the AHCA DOES cover?  #Trumpcare #MakeAmericaSickAgain #DontBePoor
What is the point of having insurance that covers nothing?
What does it cover? Viagra?
@NancyPelosi @SenFeinstein So, what are Democrats going to DO besides just politely disagree and vote 'no'? Anything...?
oh, nothing important, apparently. What IS covered? 
at some point they're going to tell us we're being punked right? I mean ha ha right?
leaving coverage for tanning salons.
So like, if all these are removed, WHAT THE HELL DOES HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS COVER?!?! #wtfman #srsly
Prostate exams, I think. Assuming 'outpatient care' only refers to hospitals, not doctor office visits.
hmmm, whats left? if I get the flu, I am covered. Its like auto insurance that pays only for windshield breaks.
The same Rs who claim mental health, not guns, cause mass shootings now want to cut essential mental health services
after making it easier for them to obtain a gun...
What's left?
It doesn't seem like much would be left...
I love how republicans are forcing you to have an unwanted pregnancy, but then taking away the care! Pro birth no pro life!
what then DOES it cover?
It covers tax breaks for the rich.
this bill guts health insurance
They must vote this bill down.
