how is that different than #ACA?
@NancyPelosi @SenFeinstein Don't bend to Republican pressure Say NO to Gorsuch! Say NO to AHCA!
Thank you! I'm glad you are my Congress person!
@Oooooo_Donna Horrible for insurance companies, lose 24 m customers. Great for insurance CEOs.
@IdahoIndependen the same people all their legislation always helps
Not the majority of America!
Thank you Kamala for caring. Glad that I voted for you. #ImpeachTrump #TrumpRussia #TheResistance
And that STILL isn't good enough. They want our essential health benefits too. 

Trump voters? Anything to say?
they're not listening.. they're watching Fox & Friends discuss the leakers and democratic obstructionists
@SenateDems This is misleading and unhelpful.  Do your job.
That's exactly why GOP are being so divisive - if people are divided and conquered they can't unite against the 0.1 %
@SenateDems politics of envy
*Billionaires
The only folks Republicans care about...
@lockedmith As someone with a master's in Health admin I wasn't wondering I knew years ago
@SenateDems it doesn't help baby killers and life long welfare suckers.
@BarackObama @VP44 @SenSchumer Why is GOv ignoring Emoluments Clause?Just impeach him 4 that now Investigation takes 2 long
Forcing millions of Americans to purchase insurance that the rest of us pay for did what? Hurt the insurance industry?
@SenateDems hang on to imploding obamacare but forget your doctor and the increasing premiums...such  a deal!
GOP lead Congress seems to be concentrating on helping the wealthiest, over the rest of us!
@SenateDems 
So so True  !
So in other words 0.2% of the population.
Go Kamala Go!!!
it disturbs me that the GOP against it want it to hurt the seniors, families and poor even more!
@CeleryCaraway -Keep up the good work Senator
@SenateDems funny I did not have to ask that I already knew the insurance companies bought the Republican party
I have a copy right on this sentence.  ;-)
Im glad I voted for you. Keep it up!
Entities which will take some of this and invest it in high return overseas business. Further lowering Americas greatness.
Like your donors ?
@SenateDems What's your account look like?
@SenateDems That's what Bernie said too right before he bailed on his supporters 2 join Hillary.
Guess this is what Makes America Great Again. . .
This could apply to most @gop bills
Does that mean you're for getting rid of insurance companies altogether in favor of a Medicare-for-all program?
Or do you just want to regulate them and take a cut off the top for your election campaigns?
PLS VOTE NO

so make a difference.... Stand against @POTUS @realDonaldTrump is going to kill America #IMPEACH #ITSTIMETOGO
I finally get how this works: they get breaks; breaks=money; money buys choice; choice=good coverage. Take what you give us
Also funeral homes and cemetaries.
Don't forget pharmaceutical companies.
@SenateDems unconscionable GOP ramming through bill they're making changes to this morning and voting on tonight
please do all you can to make sure women, children and elderly don't get thrown away in health care bill - thanks!
#FalseNarrative #Frenzy of #Lefties
exactly - why does Trump act like he's doing us a favor???
@SenateDems 
NO to tax breaks for millionaires & corporations at the expense of our elderly, disabled & low income families
@SenateDems You forgot to add:  Politicians (who do their bidding)
#WTF  If you worry about #Seniors WHY NOT PAY SS & #Medicare #Taxes on the $65,000 that YOU #DONT PAY those taxes ON?
Sickness should not be for-profit. Companies should NOT make profit from sickness. Past time for single-payer. #TrumpRussia
@SenateDems sen harris, explain to me this, 10k in health bill last year on obama care..thats the deductible
Hope Ds capitalize on this horribleness. Rs have been good at media, Ds not so much. This bill is perfect to use against Rs
None of those groups are for it either!
Who cares what millionaires get? I care that I lost my affordable insurance plans because of AHCA!! Quit painting a pretty picture of AHCA!
Which Americans are screaming to end coverage for pre-existing conditions or have insurance cover LESS??  NONE!!!
those are all people the Dems care about as well because #fuck #constituents unless you can use them as a prop
@SenateDems
@SenateDems No wondering; I was pretty sure.
plus big pharma and the secret Gorka race purging/cleansing process...
It takes away almost all care for folks: seeing MD, ER visits, Hospital care, surgery, rehab, not sure re: meds
Exactly. Rare is the day I find common ground with @KamalaHarris .
USA = #Olicharchy. 
Maybe just maybe they must start working for the 99%.
#FeelTheBern
@SenateDems If Trumps supporting it we don't need to wonder
The @GOP constituency.
Actually, Im wondering why u passed on prosecuting Mnuchin after his bank and wife donated to ur 2011 campaign
So how does insuring insurance companies make great profits benefit the American ppl?  Almost time to just cut middle man
@Doreen13 yep that covers them !!!I have this horrible pit in my stomach that they are going to pass it
"Whom," Kammy.
