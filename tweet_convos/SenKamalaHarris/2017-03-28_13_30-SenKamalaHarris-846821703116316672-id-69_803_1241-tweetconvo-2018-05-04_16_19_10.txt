#CleanPowerPlan So by 2014 standards if he manages to defund Planned Parenthood he'll save 323,999 premature deaths.
[1/2] Planned Parenthood is the single largest _preventer_ of abortion in the USA.  If you want fewer abortions, support PP.
.    Maybe women shouldn't use abortion as a contraceptive because they fail to plan.
PP is the single largest prevent of abortion in the US _because it provides contraception to millions of people_. @RichardWByers
So, again: If you want fewer abortions, support PP.  And do not deny the right to autonomy of person of people who are pregnant.
[1/2] You don't get to force someone to remain pregnant when they don't want to be.  They can't force you to donate bone marrow.
[2/2] The right to autonomy of person overrides the right to life.
@HiphopTC Pollution is the solution to overpopulation of unwanted people. Disease & Wars are used as population control.
-Even if there was such a thing Trump would support the dirty kind.
@ClaireAForlani Unreal this man ! 
show me the proof of 2 premature deaths that are a direct result of climate change. I dare you
We MUST stump to the people so we can VOTE #GOP out of office! They are ruining our county & now the world! #CleanPowerPlan
@BVTNH lol I just checked abortion stats. 3000+ premature deaths a day. Let's hope he overturns that aye?
75% ppl choose abortion @ or below poverty level. UR CHEE-OTUS takes food from kids so more abortions
this is the dumbest excuse for abortions yet.
meh you're wrong. Read my thread on why you're wrong and moronic.
LOL - I have degrees+, worked hard, saved & retired @ 62. Why can't U?
TORO PUPU
your planned parent hood murder more each year
Planned Parenthood has Trump beat on premature deaths. Oh, and they can do it in only 3 days!!
the fuck? You support the baby butchers @PPact
wow 3600,how about the 50k a year from opiates happening right now,not important? Worry about somthing today thats real
I'm guessing those premature deaths don't include the number of premature deaths that will be lost to abortions.
.   How many babies will Planned Parenthood kill between now and 2030?
Exactly right + is not Clean Power harming jobs. Is change from new tech along with our failure to help workers/corps adapt
#unbornlivesmatter #defundplannedparenthood #stopkillingbabies
if he doesn't care about his own health he should at least care about his children and grandchildren. Money won't matter!
"Science"
#ClimateChangeIsReal !!!
@AnneWheaton it's all part of @realDonaldTrump plan to lower unemployment, dead people aren't unemployed.
how many premature deaths does Planned Parenthood cause per year?
And you can prove this, how?
3600...a days work for planned parenthood.
start pushing for heavier funding for nuclear fusion research! The cleanest, safest energy source!
Fewer people to provide healthcare for. NOT!!
Just making up stuff now.
So happy we have your voice representing us and speaking truth to lunacy.
give me the name of one person dead due to co2 emissions.
@AnneWheaton prolife much
Why not start programs to retrain the coal miners in green / solar tech? We shouldn't suffer bc their jobs R now obsolete.
Nah. But hey, keep on with the hyperbolic overreactions.
Kind of like driving cars yeah? How many deaths do cars cause each year?
Please don't let this go through. This is terrorism.
#fudt #CleanPowerPlan #MakeAmericaPollutedAgain #ClimateMarch #ActOnClimate #DeadInTheUSA 
There's no proof of that. You're making it up.
The illegal aliens you're protecting will probably result in ten times more premature deaths each year.
Thanks 4 BEING for #WeThePeople for #CleanPowerPlan >@SenKamalaHarris Pls RT:
Maybe you can ask your AIPAC masters why they keep selling bombs and lobby for abominable wars OF CHOICE. #CleanPowerPlan
Bombs kill more people in 51 days.  Bombs don't leave anything left to clean, bombs dont prevent deaths. #CleanPowerPlan
I can't "like" this, when I want to cry. This is a "repeal" for spite! To quote him: "Very sad! Sick!"
Even the NYT said this would do absolutely nothing to the climate unless all other major economies did it too.
One can hope. It won't accomplish what 45 wants anyhow, but it just makes him look petty!
PLEASE DO SOMETHING!!!
just another reason we need #Universalhealthcarenow. Please stand with Bernie Sanders.
how many deaths a year would be prevented if abortion were outlawed?
0.
yeah...ok
So Progressive Hollywood and Sanctuary Cities full of Democrats & Illegals in CA will all choke to death? #CleanPowerPlan
Deaths from not following #CleanPowerPlan concentrate in places with many coal power plants - Texas, Indiana, Appalachia.
Trump is doing things that will disproportionately harm the very people who supported him.  Cut out the dangerous nonsense.
MayB pollution will slow birth rate there improve national IQ & we won't have any stupid conversations like this
3600 x 13 = 46,800 people. The ripple effect hits every one of their families and communities.
In sadly psychotic, toxic mind, Trump obsessed with undoing Pres Obama's climate legacy after being mocked at 2011 WHCorDinner.He is hateful
@DoNoHarm123   psychowill probably say "if they don't survive they would've been losers. We only want winners born now". 
YES
Humans are expendable commodities to Republicans who 
Theory-based ... ?
Based on the known effects of poor air quality on human health: http://www.lung.org/about-us/media/press-releases/clean-power-plan-essential.html?referrer=https://duckduckgo.com/ â€¦ .
theory.  Try living in the real world
Weak defense. Fetuses being aborted is the mother's choice. Once a baby is born, make sure it lives in a clean world.
.@SenKamalaHarris you are fake as hell.
#CleanPowerPlan
#CleanPowerPlan #RESISTANCE  Well we don't have to worry about ruining the planet if no one is alive to live on it. SAD
Sad day for America! Instead of leading in the world in clean energy innovation, we are moving backwards!
We need to call them pro-fetus.
the cost of healthcare is going to skyrocket.
You mean, more than it already has under obamacare?
ACA has made the cost of healthcare lower than it would otherwise be.  Do not promote disinformation.
y not? Your doing it. LoL
sigh. You're.  Auto correct got me.
You know how all those coal miners on Obamacare got there? Well, that's exactly where Trump wants to take them back to.
You mean abortions?
that's one way to get ppl off the health care rolls. They're shameless.
