hope the bill never sees the light of day.
eh, it should be framed and hung in the wall when complete
@wilytone Much rather see HUD housing for homeless and Meals on Wheels funded than a symbolic wall!
Actually, much more than that. Over 30% in some localities.
Percent of local programs' budgets from gov't funds varies.
@VeganVagrant Before you do that ask yourself a question. Does the wall, and following immigration laws keep us safe?
not a bit. Plenty of ways to bypass a wall if you really wanted to.
too bad we don't have a problem with immigration.
can I safely assume you do not have a fence in your yard anywhere, lock your car & home, allow strangers inside your home?
heard this argument before. OK... Why would we want to spend a fortune on a security system and cut the upkeep?
cut the upkeep? Who mentioned that? It's just 1 part of many. Aids our border officers to do their jobs.
you used a house analogy. So did I.Why spend on a fancy security system for a home and skip the home  maintenance?
ok I didn't get that. I agree maintenance is key. Can't keep the carpet cleaned when it has nonstop traffic.
honestly? To hell with the carpet. Let's keep the house standing, don't you agree? The cost  outweighs any benefit
quite obviously I don't agree with you. My question was to my state senator & what SHE does or doesn't do!
thank you.
@AVNSher #CriminalsSavior
thank you senator #NoBanNoWallNoRaids
@gmo1stmimi Do WE need to MARCH???!
How do you want US to SUPPORT this???  Do WE need to VOTE?  Do WE need to DONATE?  Do WE need to PETITION?
@luvman33wife US #CITIZENS STANDING BEHIND YOU WAVING #AMERICANFLAG PROUDLY -- #Resist
.@SenKamalaHarris But it'll be affordable once Trump starves the elderly!
I Twitter that during that campaign! I knew our tax $ was going to a ridiculous wall! Who's paying for the wall??? USA!
I like this bigly-er-sorry. A lot!
YOU are Anti-American!  You don't belong here! People like you are the Danger to our Democracy!
@realdonaldtrump can't stand strong women; keep it up!
The wall keeps us safe and insures immigrants come in the right way. Are you saying those are bad things?
@Larramarr1980 wow, I had no idea this was possible, great news.
Thank you
@nancymoskowitz Yeah!!!
@Gypsysister58 THANK YOU!
thank you
Thank You!!!! #NoWall
.@SenKamalaHarris yet drugs pouring across border is okay
Illegals are more important than citizens to you

You wonder why DJT elected
thank you Senator. That wall is Ridiculous.
Yeah because personally I don't want to pay for it and I know there's a million plus people who don't want to either.
blood on Ur leftist biased hands 4 thousands of opiod deaths and hundreds of deaths by illegals that a wall would prevent
@Twytterpaytyd That's great Sen Harris. Now how do we get him impeached? I'm tired of being scared! NO WAR!!!!!!!
now is the time for dems to offer solutions to Obamacare or single payer.  Don't let Trump stick you with the crisis.
@indivisibletx03 Thank you!! #NoBanNoWallNoRaids #Impeach45 #TrumpRussia #maddow #reiders #inners
.@SenKamalaHarris CA voters haven't forgotten that our attempt to stop illegal immigration in '94 was overturned by fed'l courts. Since then
.@SenKamalaHarris Can we also then end #SanctuaryCity policies & programs that attract illegal immigration. CA people against them!
Paraphrasing Mulvaney - I consider the wall to be a waste of my tax dollars. It will show no benefit.
When do we #impeachTrump? Every day, more frightening behaviors. Unconstitutional President!
Yes! Thank you!
Thank you so much!  #NoBanNoWallNoRaids
There's no way Donny can legally pull together the tens of billions of dollars this wall is going to cost. Congress!
@SenKamalaHarris
Thank You! Let's tear down walls
Thank you!  @SenKamalaHarris Please keep the pressure on! We all deserve common sense/progressive representation.
@UberGuber You're the best.

That was a mistake.Do you care about America and its citizens because your actions are doing not showing it.
Thank you. People look up the word rescind.
Thank you!
how do you propose to secure our boarder?Or do you intend to continue to allow drugs,contraband and illegal aliens to enter
thank you! Are you considering legislation in Calif that requires Trump submit taxes if want onto ballot in CA 2020?
@dstuef Now we will paying for two walls.  Trudeau says Canada is building a wall and America is going to pay for it
Taking away Meals on Wheels, cutting budgets for safe water, higher cost ins 4 HIS wall - he wants, he shd pay for it 
Right thing to do.
Thank you for trying to block this ridiculous waste of tax dollars #nowall
now that's fighting!
THANK YOU! #morewomeningovernmentnow
thank you!!
Their budget is filled with cuts that help the poor and elderly.
THANK YOU! I absolutely DO NOT wax my tax dollars spent this way!!!!!! NO WAY.
good for you!
Ridiculous on the face of it, few come over the 'wall' as it is now. It's stupid and silly and vain. RESIST.
build the wall slow down the flow of drugs and illegals

I refuse to pay one cent for that #fuckingwall ! Thank you Senator!
Thank You!  Please press democrats who remain silent on all his BS to DO THEIR JOBS!
Thank you.  I didn't vote for 45 and I sure as hell didn't sign up to pay for a damn wall.
@suejohnston56
@StrangeRemains Thank God someone has some sense!!!
Dems are the minority party. But hey thanks for virtue signaling.
Now that the govt is run like a business, where can i find the cost/benefit analysis for border wall? #NoBanNoWallNoRaids
The Trump admin and Republicans leadership would discredit it, just like they did with OMB analysis of AHCA.
Illegal aliens cost US taxpayers 113B/year. I see the wall as a cost saver. 24B in remittances, yup. Mexico will pay.
Please save us from the Wall!
thank you Senator Harris!!
thank you!
Woohoo!
let's use funds for the "wall" for healthcare for ALL Americans, same plan as government employees have.
excellent!
Thank you
why should I pay my taxes for something so idiotic, expensive, and not wanted by majority of people?
We very much appreciate your fire Senator!
THANK YOU
excellent!
I don't make much, but I'll happily pay for PBS, NPR, the Arts. I do NOT want to pay for that wall and it's maintenance >.<
THANK YOU.
Thank you Senator. Even though I live in a next door state, I am claiming you as my senator too!  Love Trumps Hate!
thank you!!!

Thank you for all your hard work! You are a badass!
Im proud that I voted for you. You consistently represent my values, and what I believe is best for our country. Thank you.
YES!!!!  what a waste to build a wall.  Let's send the money to PBS, NEA, EPA, CIA....
That is awesome!  Any evidence of bipartisan support?
- please tell that old battle axe, Dianne, to get onboard!  Please help us find a better Dem to run in her place next time.
Thank you
Thank you and good luck with getting it passed. What a profound waste of money that is much needed elsewhere.
it is beyond ridiculous! Thank you.
@EllenMorris1222 This should be just as persistent as attempts to repeal Obamacare during last administration! Thank You!
thank you!!!
Thank you!
What a colossal waste of our money. The guy continues to be a great con man & a poor businessmen.
Wow Daniel, who knew you had a Park Ave. home and private jet???
Please stop the defending of PBS. Please!
Closer to a trillion needed for the nonsense he wants. SMH.
Please contact me if I can help.
Yay! Persistence in #TheResistance is paying off.  Thank you for standing up for the people.
AMEN!#POW
