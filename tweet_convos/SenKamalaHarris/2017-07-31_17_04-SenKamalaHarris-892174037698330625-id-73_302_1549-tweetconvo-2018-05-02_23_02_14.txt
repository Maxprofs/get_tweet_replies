You won't be president with 2.2 billions bucks backing you. #neverharris #nevermnuchin #sandersgabbard2020 #nosellouts
Let's hope healthcare, pay inequality, immigration, travel ban and many other issues are resolved long before construction starts. #oops!

CONGRATS !! You will be in your last year of your second term as President that year!!! @DNC
Holding out for a HARRIS 2020, Bro

By time 2028 is here 3/4 of LA & state will be boarded-up & desolate.
Bankrupt from gov spending.
But hey, they'll have neat sports venues!
There may not be a ca. By then. Your taxes and communism are killing us.
Hey, if I draw up impeachment papers for you, will you sign them?asking cuz IT'S GETTING WORSE! and I am wondering when senate do job#Resist
born & raised in CA.  The state already has 20 mil too many people so be sure you tell the visitors to go home.
Can you imagine the traffic  on the 5, 405, 133 101,  110, 710, 610, 57,170,  91, toll road 73, and backlogging Highway 1??   OMG..
Once upon a time in paradise I drove 90 MPH on 10 on my way to college.  1962 was a very good year.   lol
Nice...
Let's hope you welcome them as our President!!!
Could you run for President?

The Olympics have historically and consistently provided great opportunities for graft, while beggaring its hosts. Good luck. You'll need it
I just started following you!  I love what you stand for! Go Girl! 
2028 would be the final year of your Presidency.
I would totally vote for you if you run for prez!  #Harris2020
As President of the United States! 
Yes, a good use of taxpayer dollars. We can totally afford it, we have money trees here
California, where the middle class is leaving in droves.  Kamala = Hillary.
Great, as if traffic isn't bad enough, give the Olympics to Tijuana instead you can't tell the difference anyway!
Obama----refused to nominate a black person for the Supreme court

He was totally USELESS to blacks

As POTUS please  let me know when I can volunteer for your run pls
You better get busy providing water storage!
Sorry, I just can't look forward to the 2028 Olympics in LA because I'll be turning 50 later that year :( Only 7 yrs from retirement though!
Woot woot!

Can't wait to host the Olympics!

Last time they were here I was a teeny tiny little girl!
Who needs the Olympics you let everybody in already.
Olympics are a corporate rip off.
Hopefully you will vote out of politics by then hopefully by 2018.
We want have too worry about having the Current President showing up
Long flight on Air Force One to get there, but worth the trip for sure!
Thrilled for this. But no concern for the riverside fire. Priorities kamala. Oh you can't make a buck off fire, but the Olympics you see $$
So exciting I have just enough time to figure out what I'm going to wear  #LA2028
Would be amazing for you to preside over ceremonies as POTUS!
Me too!!
Kamala, will they bring their #own #Water?

Thank you @realDonaldTrump
I hope we can live long enough to see it
Hope we have a #MadamPresident by then!
Giving them Dem voter registrations form with their welcome packets? You will have seceded by then and we will have taken it back by force.
I think LA will come to rue it
Impeachment
If we are not nuked off the planet by then.. -45 is angering China and has NO diplomacy for the DPRK.. Tell -45 NOT to push the button......
Congrats CA--the Angels have graced the state with success

Couldn't agree more!! So excited about #LA2028!
Maybe you'll be President by then!
You'll have been president for 8 yrs by then! #Harris2020
You'd have to win re-election to a 2nd  term to welcome them as a Senator -- which I have no doubt you will!
#Adulteress
