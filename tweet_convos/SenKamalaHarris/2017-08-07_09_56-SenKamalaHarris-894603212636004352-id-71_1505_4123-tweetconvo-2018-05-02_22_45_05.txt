Blumenthal lied.
Trump lies more and dosent correct it ever Blumenthal did!!
Except the @POTUS he's too  busy tweeting attacks on other people's service.
He doesn't get to celebrate. He didn't deserve his purple heart.
Except the president he's busy golfing and disrespecting vets
We honor our Vets, wounded in heroic service, while Trump disparages vets like John McCain. Thank you to the real heroes.
Blumenthal is no hero, nor is McCain.....
Both served their country. That's more than can be said for Trump with his 5 draft deferments. Trump no patriot; he's out for himself.
Just b/c they "served our country" doesn't me either of them aren't total scumbags!!!
Willie Brown sure took good care of you. When will be able to trust you, esp. after your #OneWest failure? @ActualFlatticus
Exactly what I would have said! #purpleheartday
My father was in WWII  lost part of his right arm just below elbow also shot in the legs too !!
"Without your sacrifices American Imperialism would be neutered. Thank you for keeping the cash flow rolling"
@goodoldcatchy 

@SenKamalaHarris acting more Presidential than our sitting one.
The sitting president isn't a president. He's a conman and a sociopath. He was voted in by angry marks.
We need more like you. thank you to all service men & women wounded or KIA. Blessings for the unselfish real Americans & their families
What does she know about sacrifices, she serves herself, and the Oligarchy !  Phoney - baloney !

Thank all of you for your service
"I always wanted one of these"

#sad #weak #dearleader
FU
I agree completely, but why does @realDonaldTrump have a Purple Heart Medal? What sacrifice, what service? Why's he allowed to hold the PHM?

Amen to that !!!
We will vote u out this round
And what about our warriors with #PTSD Haven't they earned the #PurpleHeart too?
Thank you to my uncle Philip and uncle Andrew for their bravery and Purple Hearts.
of course, let's thank those #dumb, #stupid #monkeys that sacrificed themselves for #falsehoods and #lies on #PurpleHeartDay...

#military
Democrats are anti-military and anti-police. Quit lying. You love convicts and dopers and screw the military.
#PurpleHeartDay  @realDonaldTrump  jokes about the suffering of others for his own amusement. Karma can't come soon enough. #TrumpRussia

No one more brave than u @SenKamalaHarris. Keep fighting the good fight and keep ur voice loud and proud! Don't let alt-left Dems dissuade u
They are not served well by their civilian leaders
I rarely agree with what you say, Senator, but on this issue, I am with you 100%. Thank you.
You're welcome.
The only good thought you ever had
And we do not take purple hearts from their owners and boast like a little child. (We're looking at you Mr. BONE SPURS!)
Let's not let the 20+ a day die in vein
We just try to make the world safer for nice ladies like you! 
True and thanks for our Vets service which I'am one,however how about not getting involved in these nonsensical never ending conflicts.
#OnThisDay On This Day￼￼
Aug 07, 1782, George Washington created the Order of the Purple Heart.
Why did you and your party betray me when I was fighting a war you sent me to?
Thank you for this.  My daddy had 4 #purplehearts from Vietnam, and died in 2014 due to lymphoma caused by Agent Orange.
Please ask Senator Graham why He has a Bronze Star. False Valor.
#PresidentialSpeak
Wish u would help me contact generals 2 put a stop 2 recruiters forcing autistic kids 2 enlist then raping them leading 2 suicide/murder.

@Launterfied2, that's complete and utter nonsense. @SenKamalaHarris is one of the people responsible for the Consumer Bill of Rights.
.@SenKamalaHarris Veterans day is everyday. But we can start by never taking away their healthcare, so stop @trumpdumpcare now. #Trumpcare
