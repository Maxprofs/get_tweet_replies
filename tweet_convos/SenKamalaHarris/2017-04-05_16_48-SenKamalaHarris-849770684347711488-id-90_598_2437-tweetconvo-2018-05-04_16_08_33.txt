Your vote doesn't matter
Yes! I approve of this message.  Thank you Kamala.
Thank you Sen Harris. Your constituent
Thank you #StopGorsuch #TrumpRussia
Too bad
I like this kamala harris btr than the "russia russia russia" kamala.
You are a liberal sell out. You are what is bad for this country. You don't adhere to the US Constitution. You play politics...hypocrite.
thank you.
You should vote yes to confirm. He's qualified and has a record of putting the Constitution/law above ideology. That should be what matters
Where does the constitution say that a broken truck is more important than employees life? @SenKamalaHarris @SenateDems @mic
Congress/state legislature can pass a Le at anytime. This does not and should not take SCOTUS. Congress needs to stop punting to the courts
it is a very important vote. I don't want a Cheif Justice Roberts bed buddy. period.
Too bad
Thank you...we are a circus. Please "no" on any portion of this man's agenda.
Haha
You are a shameful woman . Embarrassed of you . You don't represent me
Times like this where the representatives of the people that follow party instead of people makes me sick. Listen to people
.@SenKamalaHarris will vote NO on #Gorsuch & fight to block his nomination.

It's Kamala Harris, not Pamela,but you know that corrector and I didn't catch it, sorry Kamala
Sorry to nitpick! Couldn't tell if was autocorrect issue or trolling method I wasn't understanding.  
Not at all, thanks for bringing it to my attention!
shame on you
#JusticeGorsuch
I guessed that when he was originally announced.  Imagine that.
Did any of you saying thank you watch the hearings? This man will follow the Constitution&the law. Why would u not want someone doing this?
Thank you for holding your ground! Filibuster him out!

Great article, Senator. He seriously asked to rehear an argument?? *incredulous* and he's "Looking backward"? What?? Keep fighting.
Haha

#TheResistance

Yup!
Thank you! #NoOnGorsuch
Haha! Too bad loser
Embarrassed of you

Well bless your pea pikin heart, all the way back to civil life, cause we're gonna see to it you're not reelected!  #LoveGorsuch not you.
thank you
booooo for you
Thank you!
Wow. Must be nice to be one of her constituents. You all should say"hey"to Joe Donnelly, because he isn't listening to us anymore
Just because Trump picked him. Boooooooo
Thank you @SenKamalaHarris #California 
Thank you!!!!!
Why don't you vote yes & show that you aren't a puppet?
I thought you'd use the obvious standby reason to vote no #RussianInterference #Dems reason for everything!!
Thank you !! No nominee during #trumprussia russia gate @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr
Thank you, Kamala Harris!
Thank you
You need to find 3 GOP senators to flip
A "deeply conservative worldview" is not a disqualifier on interpretation of laws. You want someone who judges on ideology over constitution
Thank you, Senator!!
thank you Senator Harris
Thank you Senator Harris for all your hard work. #indivisiblesf
Thank you, Senator!
Thank you!
It is easy to say no. I only hear cons, are there any pros? Maybe u can suggest an alternative that would also be acceptable to Republicans?
this guy prefers Corporate rights vs the Individual. So much for Trumps "I'm for you" agenda. Shilling is obscene everywhere on Cap Hill
@SenateDems @mic way to go!
Losing party - downhill ha! Ha!
Just like Betty DeVoss is absolutely wrong for Dept of Education.
NO vote -will cost you @KamalaHarris disappointing...you lack the ability to lead. Use your intelligence -avoid becoming a follower!
You're jealous. He's twice the Constitutional scholar you PRETEND to be. Same with Feinstein. God how ignorant people get elected!!
Bravo! 
You lost ! Haha!
Thank you. GOP won't listen to the millions of people who have contacted them to oppose Gorsuch.
Ask McConnell what happens when Dems gain control and a vacancy opens on the Supreme Court.
Thank you
That is nice and all, bit what can you do about this push through? A supreme court nominee needs more than a simple majority. #injunction
Thank you Senator Harris. Republicans filibustered 52 times during the Obama administration.
Thank you!
Enjoy your seat until 2018, then say bye-bye. #MAGA #NuclearOption
Thank you
Thank you so much for standing up for women, and men, in fighting the appointment of Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.
So many diversions in news today #GorsuchPlagiarism story was squelched. Gorsuch, Melania, Monica Crowley #Plagiarism...a Trump trait #SAD
THANK YOU! Thank you for @katieporteroc support looking forward to getting rid of Mimi
As a Veteran I thank you!  GOP should not be rewarded 4 stealing a SCOTUS seat!
Thank you, Senator! #NoGorsuch
I hope the nuclear option isn't activated to force him through.
thank you for standing up and putting country first! proud to be in california
thank you!
Thank you! Glad to be one of your constituents.
Thank you Senator Kamala!!!!
Its so great you use political reasoning and issues to cloud your judgement and obstruct progress in this country. Party over country huh?
Thank you, Senator!
