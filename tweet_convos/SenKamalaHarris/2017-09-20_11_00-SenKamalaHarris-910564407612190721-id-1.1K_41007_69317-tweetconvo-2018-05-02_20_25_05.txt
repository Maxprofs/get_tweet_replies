CA #SB277 violates "first do no harm" but the thousands upon thousands of parents opposing it were betrayed by pharma front politicians.
#SB277 has less to do with health and more to do with wealth and power. Govt does not have a higher claim on our bodies than we. #NotASlave
I would much rather my insurance premium and Drug costs go to taxes for Universal HC for all but Republicans can't think outside the box.
I did the math. We maxed out of pocket last year. If I add up that & my premiums, my Medicare tax could go up 8% and I'd still save 50%.
Then there's the drug ads all over TV. Drug costs are being spent on Advertising. Universal would eliminate all of it. TAKE PROFIT OUT 
If I could like this infinity I would. Big pharma has no morals. Robots with no feelings. How can they be blind to it?
As long as there is greed there will always be suffering.
as long as there are dead beats living off the earnings of the working people there will always be suffering. its hurting working familes
Dead beats like greed grifter who lived off daddy, squandered inheritance, bankruptcies,max debt, living off tax payer at Trump BIZ. #GOOGLE
I actually am healthier than norm once they just let my Specialist do his treatment plan. Let's see 1,000 a month or 14yr exp therapist $
#CitizensUnited establishes Christianity as the state religion and the US as a fascist theocracy-which is a Violation of the 1st amendment.
the founding fathers made plain about what this country was built on go do a little research before opening your big mouth.
Here's a better idea. Do it yourself Putin-bot. Run along now. You don't run this country.
Talk about the economic impact. Because when they cause the next recession,  everyone will know why it happened
Everyone should know why it happened, or will happen, but you can't convince a trumpflake with reason or logic. They'll still blame Obama.
You Obuma  flakes are the very people he hurt the worst, he was such a failure that it will take an act of GOD for another to be elected
Also unconstitutional , it doesn't promote the general welfare
Unconstitutional, doesn't mean a lot to the GOP anymore
Lady I think you got mixed up its the DNC and Obama who did not think much of the constitution Hillery even wanted to change it her way.
no, I am not mixed up.we have a president now who is against free speech. Hillary did not want to change it..your proof? bet ya got none
@IamLuisGuzman So does the American Nurses Assoc, of which I am a proud member!
Of course anyone who had gone through life insurance to medical insurance even when A1C NEVER OVER 6.0. But then amputation is pre condition
you mean like all the harm Obamacare has caused to alot of ppl!!
If you think the two are comparable, I feel bad for you. I have two elderly parents with healthcare issues. The #ACA has only helped them.
how about all the millions of ppl that have NO healthcare because ins. companies have bailed on Obamacare yet pay alot of $$$
You need to learn your facts, not GOP rhetoric. Truth is Trump is doing all he can to ruin a successful system. Because Obama created it.
Isabelle is either a bot, or a braindead bimbo. In either case 'she' should be ignored.

Look likes Trump's resume.
Interesting-AMA opposes bill by citing #1stDoNoHarm principle yet they're part of the industry causing 3rd most US deaths @realDonaldTrump

This is pathetic.  Reps have completely abdicated their responsibility to the American people.

Get this - AMA controls the amount of medical students in the pipeline, artificially driving up the salaries of doctors.
You are so wrong. Med schools control the number of students. And we are facing a massive Physician shortage due to lack of residency slots
You should look into it more.
I don't need to. Check my physician credentials on google. I've been in AMA, TMA, and the Physicians Foundation for 20 years.
http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/11/its-doctors-who-control-number-doctors-america-not-government/ … 

Physicians play a large role in the slots available.
That article is loaded with wrong info. Md practices are in top 10 small businesses going bankrupt. Only 8-11 cents of every $ spent goes2md
That is because of insurance. And nothing related to what i said. But digs into your soon to come defense of medical pay.
That is one of many articles which all claim the same thing.
Yes and Dr. @BillCassidy is in violation of his Hippocratic Oath .  AMA needs to investigate him.
What's wrong with the medical professions motto first do no harm that should be the first priority.
Get this - Koch admitted to the crime of bribery. The republicans will get no money unless they repeal healthcare & get taxes done. Charges?
Get me a chance to get off get PhD try to cure sports concussions. I'm I only one who sees benefits community more!!!
Republicans don't care about us. THEY will continue to have Cadillac Care for themselves. How does that qualify as basic decency?
They must be voted out of office. All of them must be gone.  If we can get a clean vote, it could happen.  A fair vote is the answer.
be careful what you wish for you just might get it, then there would be no liberal democrats in public office.
I see you.
Cassidy is a physician and should be sanctioned by the AMA for violations of the Hippocratic oath
Somtimes you have to tear down (do harm) to build up (do good). We have cliches too.
Get this, we have a madman trying to start wars over his twitter account.  CONGRESSNEEDSTODEALWITHTHISNOW

i don't get why are we going thru this again? we the people have already let them know, we don't want #TrumpDeathCare on the last attempt
They apparently have forgotten we're here @SenateGOP.
Guess it will come down to which special interest has more . Go #AMA. Beat #Koch!
And the AMA doesn't have 1/100th the money the Koch Bros have.
When are they coming out against Planned Parenthood because it violates "First, do no harm?"

Part of me wonders if their goal is to kill off the middle and lower classes, so only the upper class can live in the US.
I've thought of that also.
#AnyDecentHealthCarePratitionerOpposesTrumpCare ; Those who do not took our #Oath to #FirstDoNoHarm disingenuously ...
Love you please run. These against the aca. Owe the ones who buy elections.
We need you or someone like you to be our President!!
succinct.
No, the AMA opposed it bc it's a liberal organization that is as political as it is interested in science n medicine.
I am a retired healthcare professional and know a lot of current professionals and Doctors and they say Obama Care is very bad
the AMA has also begun to shift support to the Democrats, favoring their attempts expand Medicare payments.
We believe them with their 
CONTRIBUTIONS
Of 
$1,937,853 
And ranks 265 of 18,591
LOBBYING.  All democrats
Uh, that would describe Obamacare.
Do you know anybody who is on Obamacare pays $1,000 a month as a $8,000 deductible we do
I am not surprised.  It does violate the Hippocatic oath.
The abortion industry violates do no harm, and they don't have any problem with that! It's the Hypocrites Oath!
Where was this when obamcare passed? Or it's ok to hurt some
Well duh
I've been tweeting Cassidy has violated his Hippocratic Oath when he co-authored it!

Obama care causes harm to those who can't afford insurance. What about the penalties folks pay for not being insured. We NEED better.
Any congressperson who's a doctor and votes to take away healthcare should lose their licence.
http://www.naturalnews.com/037152_AMA_racketeering_history.html … The #progressiveSocialist  propaganda machine continues with flunkies like Reiner & Harris.  #MAGA @POTUS #FakeNews
The GOP took the hypocritical oath long ago. As Grassley admitted, they are locked in on ACA destruction.
This bill is not a #healthcarebill; it is #HealthCareRepeal. Or, more properly, a #TaxCut.TaxCuts are the #GOP response to everything. #Sad!
They also supported ACA.  Their cred is done.
@SenFeinstein 's ohone number is not working. Will you let her know, please?
Oaths mean more 2  http://med.community  than oaths of Trumps gang of senators & house reps @PublicHealth
Any congressional doctors voting for it could face licensing issues, then?

these are the same people partially responsible for opiate crisis
It will take generations for Americans to understand 'the greater good' of universal healthcare, but I guess this is start.
Have them free only! My deductible is $10,000. Arizona!
This is a desperate attempt to make Republicans look good, no matter what the cost to people in USA
@realDonaldTrump @GOP @SenateGOP @ChuckGrassley @SenJohnMcCain Wow the Republicans really hate middle class America! All for Koch tax break!
@realDonaldTrump @VP @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr
Wow
As a doctor, I agree w/the @AmerMedicalAssn#GrahamCassidyDEATH bill will leave MILLIONS uncovered.

Vote NO
Get this - the American Medical Association opposes the Graham-Cassidy “health care” bill because it violates “first, do no harm.”
that's murder
We get it, now we need the Senate to get. Please stop trying to kill us on behalf of corporations.
Of course, the AMA endorsed Trump and his HHS Sec pick.
Absurd
But it's in keeping with GOP's Hypocritical Oath.
The violation of the Hippocratic Oath happens when babies are murdered like Sanger's dream of "eliminating the weeds." Read her diaries
Where was your outrage when millions lost their Healthcare due to OCARE? Over 100 counties have not 1 insurer. Those ppl have no healthcare
They advocated for the ACA and it has done catastrophic harm.
Why is this thing still a thing? Nobody but 17% of ignorant people who believe they are being taken advantage of believe this is great.
And Medicaid director of all 50 states! Plus every medical association, physician and nursing as well.
It seem like "DR" Cassidy forgot this little gem I reminded him yesterday. How does he still have a license to practice #KillerMD
Tell Bernie and Amy to call off the debate this is not the right time! Keep focus on GrahmCassidy and off Bernies plan that can't pass!!!!
block-grants wer always better at distributing $ in St. It would create $100s of billions in budget savings 4 tax cuts. Isn't that the idea
Ok now who was the first Trumpet to call the AMA a liberal leftist organization?
This bill is the GOP'S deal with the devil & his fallen castaways. With a blood signed contract, fire & brim at their feet, payment is due
Hey if Obamacare lowered premiums no one would be having this discussion. Sorry, you're on the losing side.
Get this - 700 billion dollars can be spent on better things than perpetual war.
Please, resist!
Agreed.. they will do harm.
#VoteNOGrahamCassidy
Spearhead the "protect our votes 2018 initiative". Russians don't want congress flip blue to impeach Trump. Protect our votes! Start a bill!
Finally some voice of Reason
Thank You
GOP Addendum: unless the tax cuts are big enough!
Kamela, what's The American Medical Association's position on chopping up living babies in light of the Hippocratic Oath to "do no harm?"
Harm is what the Republicans do for fun. Especially when they are going to greedily profit from it. Come to think of it, that is all they do

and Lindsay "Hoo-Ha" Graham and Bill "The Joker" Cassidy have the audacity to claim it passes the #JimmyKimmelTest ?  #Liars
Tell that to @LindseyGrahamSC and @BillCassidy They are out there blatantly lying to us about this monstrosity.
Since he's a doctor that means he is breaking his oath.
Shut up Harris.... hypocrite sexist
Kamala.  Sucks
no way
I #VoteNo on #GrahamCassidy!
do no harm means you don't take a life.
Wow
Get this - You spew lies out of your mouth.
Get this - you're a rude person.
#KochBrothers pledge 400 million if @SenateGOP & @HouseGOP repeal #Obamacare
400M/32 million citizens removed from the rolls
1 LIFE = $12.50
Graham,  Cassidy & the Entire Jackass ACA Destroyers only care about What The KOCH Bros, Steve Wynn & the rest of the BBC commands them 2 do
@lisamurkowski Kudos for wanting real healthcare instead of "we need to pass anything" healthcare. Thank you for caring about America.
This should be called the Graham-Catastrophe act 
if it passes.
There wont be any harm
because you wont be able to see a doctor.
Hippocratic Logic apparently.
Ms Harris, you need to get someone to write tweets who understands what they write. saying 'get this' usually means the content is stupid.

When do we get rid of you,because you violate common sense!

Supporters of 2nd rate reality star @realDonaldTrump say @jimmykimmel isn’t qualified to discuss healthcare. How droll.  

#healthcare 4 all
BS! Most smart physicians don’t belong to #Leftist #AMA. They sold out physicians under #Obummercare.
Get this 63million voted against u and ur party...trump train 2020
People are complaining that they can't get appointments if everyone is covered under health insurance. BS. They don't have to wait now.
Kamala supports this bill cuz it has NO chance of becoming law.

@SenKamalaHarris @RealMuckmaker #MedicareForAll #neverkamala
Partisan hack!
That's an absolute lie.
You lie... You lie... YOU LIE can't wait to say good bye when you are voted out..
Why would you go on Tucker and make a complete ass out of yourself. That was absolutely hilarious
What did the AMA do before the ACA?
I lost my insurance plan when OCare kicked in. What would the AMA say to me?
You should have bought another plan from the exchange
Get this.... You're a lying, contemptuous left wing liberal commie and you'll shit out propaganda to stay in power. You have zero ethics.
Get over yourself...
you really have the balls to speak out in Public?
are you Michelle's brother?
If there is a god and she’s  a progressive woman, then this will not be! It’s horrible they play health care against tax cuts for the rich!
Get this: You sure you want to help the AMA?
American Medical Association
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Medical_Association …
@DarrellIssa will vote for this.
And will cause them loss of income
Yes it does and would be good to challenge in court of law
The thing is, the ACA does harm to millions of middle class americans.
Those are words NOT FOUND on the Hippocratic oath! I will use treatment to help the sick...but never with a view to injury and wrong-doing
@robportman does not care would rather have the Koch brothers bribe money
If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.
Like to see you, Sanders, the Clintons, Obama and the rest of your corporate & Hollywood cronies wait in line for care like vets did at VA
Harming people is their indent!
Should have done that with ObamaCare... harm is that people can't afford health care with high premiums and deductibles....
Worth noting: this is group who fiercely opposed anything single-payer for decades; 2) limited # of med schools to keep drs rare & pay high
Death panels. Remember when the GOP pretended to be concerned about people being harmed and about legislative process?
Their heads were exploding, Sarah Palin was the chief Head Exploder
You are so very wrong. Huge difference between AMA and MDs.
@CoryBooker @SenWarren @SenFeinstein GOP "deathcare" bill is Exh. A in the case for labeling the GOP a terrorist organization.  RT
Good for them!
Do no harm GOP!
The #maga people should see this and start calling their reps.
Paying attention @SenJohnHoeven???
All healthcare has been in violation of "do no harm" by virtue of denying coverage, overriding  doctor prescribed medications/proceedures
Yes it harms their paychecks ...
Seriously
Get lost
The doctors and the FDA violates that with the drugs and the food they allow in the US. Look at Europe and how much mess they are on. Nope!
Isnt Cassidy a so called doctor? Shame on him!
Uh oh.
GOP plays RUSSIAN ROULETTE with AMERICAS HEALTH Care.  #GOPDEATHSQUADS RT RT RT RT RT RT @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @TheDemCoalition
Perhaps Cassidy should lose his license.
