You really want a failed health system.i can't keep doctor.
Premiums up 250%.deductables up 400%..if plan is so good why don't you have it?
ACA has made healthcare costs lower than they otherwise would be.  They are still far higher than they should be.
Universal healthcare in the USA would allow much better control of healthcare costs while providing everyone with the care they need.
Also, under ACA, Sen. Harris - and all other members of Congress - get their healthcare coverage through the DC Health Link ACA exchange.
e.g. http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/congress-staff-insurance-dc-exchange-097571 … .

Note that GOP legislators seeking to reverse ACA want to exempt themselves from the disaster they'd create.
That hypocrisy reveals how horrific #AHCA/#BCRA were & how horrific a full ACA reversal would be. #SaveTheACA, then work for #MedicareForAll
I would really like to see a list of proposals from the Dems that would help stabilize the ACA now that repeal is dead. #seriously
ACA is entirely stable: https://twitter.com/TopherSpiro/status/882606719427387393 … .
VERIFIED: Trump/Price HHS report admits ACA markets are stable—the risk pool is not worsening as claimed. 
https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Programs-and-Initiatives/Premium-Stabilization-Programs/Downloads/Summary-Reinsurance-Payments-Risk-2016.pdf … 
As for creating something better than ACA: Half of the Democrats in Congress currently endorse #MedicareForAll: https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/676/cosponsors … .
True universal healthcare in the USA would ensure that _everyone_ can get the care they need. And it's what 55% of Americans currently want.
[1/2] 55% support for universal healthcare is an average of polls over the last few months, which found 53% to 58% support.
[2/2] Polls by the Pew Forum, Gallup, Kaiser Family Foundation.

When are we going to deal with root cause issues? Healthcare costs are runaway out of control.....the system is bloated and inefficient

Apparently the Republican party as an effective governing entity is dead too.
Trump meeting GOP senators @ WH today to talk healthcare strategy. This fight isn't over.
Trump may continue to sabotage #ACA by withholding reimbursements & not enforcing the mandate.
Astonishing that a politically embarrassed president would vengefully turn against the nation - and think he will not be held accountable.

We elected him to repeal OBAMACARE. Get along OR get lost. He is also going to stop voter fraud so you don't get re elected
Yeah because that would amount to a strangle hold in two years.
GOP used reconciliation rules to workaround a filibuster to replace ACA & failed. Now GOP needs 60 votes for a repeal alone, can't get 50.
Are you back in the Hamptons this weekend?
It's dead because it's cruel and heartless. No if we can just get the cruel and heartless to die, we'll be winning at life.
BREAKING NEWS for @realdonaldtrump

#YOUR #TrumpCare 4.0 (Repeal and that's it)
#nobody wanted to give it CPR.

#DOA
Sen Harris is right. Don't give up the fight


Why did you support a plan that would fail and needs to be fixed?
Thank u 4 working hard to protect us from the party void of empathy.
So, Trumpcare and Repeal Only Plan's are both dead - guess neither had the right medical insurance then///
8 years in the works and this is what they come up with. A lot of noice just to try and get more money  for the wealthy
Ok, can the old farts go on holiday now and leave us the F**K alone?  American people grant you a long,  long holiday away from D.C. Stay...
They are such scumbags
Fraud
You're making me proud that I voted for you. Not that I had a single doubt for a single minute. 
Yay. Now start saying "fix and keep" over & over to get this other mantra out of GOP heads.. & please run for president in 2020 #fixandkeep
Thank you for caring about the people. 
I love freshmen Dems...They are so naive...
7yrs. 7yrs!! They obstructed Obama but really. They just don't k ow how to do the job they are well paid to do
How is it that the only people with Anna backbone in Congress today are women?
Thank you for your great works Lady Senator!! Even though I am from Georgia, a RED state, I assure you I am NOT RED. Run for POTUS!!
Ms Harris - thank you for your efforts
Please anything other than Obamacare. That screwed a lot of us over. Create something that's actually for everyone.
Turtle needs to retreat into his shell.
Thank you Sen Harris, I`m so proud to be a Californian.
They're not done yet
Don't let those repubs get away with strippering millions of health ins. We are with you! No intimidation and fear!
Never give up.
NO PROBLEM THE REPUBLICANS AND PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL LET OBUMMERCARE IMPLODE, AND THEN YOU DEMOCRAPS WILL BEG FOR HIM TO YOU DEMS OUT...
Big win!! Now let's work on the affordable part of ACA, Premiums keep going up, middle class drowning.
GOP had 8 years to come up with a plan. Too busy blaming Obama for their problems to actually work

*Alternative winning*
Muslim-loving, spinelss coward
Start thinking about your running mate for 2020!  
Here's a nutty idea. How about the Republicans actually work with Democrats to fix health care? I know, right? It's ludicrous.
pure BS come next year OHCA will be dead&one will have anything.EveryoneKnewThe plan was bogus YET no one did ANYTHING to fix or make a plan

R U planning 2 ever work with colleagues- fellow Americans across the aisle 2 help CA? Or.... are you going to resist everything? #useless
Stay strong!!!  Thank you for all you are doing for us!!
You too Senator. You are crushing the game. I love it.
I could enjoy this spectacle for the next 3 years if not for the fact that the country is going down in flames.
Woman rock. If McConnell is 2 stupid 2 seek input on issues facing 1/2 of Americans aka woman with their unique needs don't expect them 2
2shut up, sit down & vote against women's interest. Way 2 go ladies ( and wear sleeveless shirts/ dresses.
Donald has no option but to own it.  All of his attempts are failing. He owns the failure to replace & improve it that he campaigned on
Ok. Ok. Ok.
You too. Thanks for everything you do for us. I live in the reddest county in FL so I REALLY appreciate you.
Tell the Republicans to more on lower my taxes.
No statue that excludes congress.
Why can't citizens have the same coverage of Congress since we pay for it?  Simple application of economy of scales.
You know it's a dying program, without change it's dead
Thank you from a constituent
That's fine for stopping legislation, but what can be done about Trump intentionally sabotaging the ACA, which he's already doing?


Congressmen are way too out of touch to have any hope, not just for the democrats, but for the future of democracy. Nearly alll corrupt!
Now they will try sabotage see how many people die before they can say I told you so first POTUS that refuses to own up to any existing pgm
now it looks like they’re going to try to gut healthcare this way.
Thank you @SenatorCollins, @SenCapito and @lisamurkowski for putting your constituents' needs first. #CountryOverParty
Pity party for the Republicans!  All together now!  1, 2, 3, awwwwwwwww!

So your plan to save Obamacare & save me from a $1350 month policy with a $7500 pp $ $12500 family deductible ?? I am sure you won't reply
Please share with followers
My explanation of what happens if Congress repeals #Obamacare without replacing it 
They just sit their asses flat, yet could be arrested for DUI every minute.
Don't take money from Clinton donors if you are going to run for president #disaster
Thanks for the leadership!!! You are amazing, keep up the fight, and we will keep yelling from the rooftops.
Yes! And thank you.
Democrats will be held responsible for Obamacare's implosion in the 2018 elections. Your strategy of obstruction will cost you.
YES! #ProtectOurCare
To say repeal and leave millions uninsured shows how much Republicans care about their "fellow" Americans.  They dont
 These @GOP ladies hit 'em with the...
GOP will attack Medicare and Soc. Sec. through the Budget.
Never let up
Yeah let's  just let Obama care drive up rates more, must be nice that the Senate exempted themselves from it
Thank you for all that you do Sen Harris...
Now we need to make them pay the bills so people with ACA can use it.
The Pressure is now on You and your Party. The President is going to let you Dems have this POS! You wanted to keep it....YOU GOT IT!
Thank you, @SenKamalaHarris
Thank you Madam Senator! (Your voter.)
@AFLCIO @jim_newell Too soon is better than 2 late 2 organize,build & energize grass root movements. 476 days til Midterms!
Respectfully, a solution. Work with R moderates to fix ACA. Call it #CongressCare. No more names. Everybody happy. Thank you!
Awesome!
Laughing u gave us Obama care.  It doesn't work.  Now let's watch
If it doesn't work then why is the majority of the country in favor of keeping it? Have you not seen the numbers? It's not even close..
Keep it then.  Have u tried using it.  Do u understand the astronomical costs of ur deductible?  Prob u don't
I have insurance through my job. But u didn't answer the question. Why is the majority in favor of keeping it?
This is going better then I expected. They just can't stop winning lol.
where is the bill ?
thank you ,thank you ,thank you, thank you, thank you for all your work on stopping trump. thank you
Acknowledged
Acknowledged:
Senator Harris. Go girl. They are scared of you. :-)
Thanks for helping the people, vote her out!
Amen AMEN !!!!!!
Yes!
I am so grateful
Keep up the fight and keep calling
Thank you for keeping us updated.
Repeal with no replacement is criminal. Both parties needs to come together and work on improvements to the ACA
Make America great again ! IMPEACH!
When he falls, it's going to be the sound heard around the world! Just like the shot heard around the world! "Concord Hymm" !
@Gisudaraz Senator can you step up and give this body some leadership. The Turtle in charge is lacking speed& direction.

Wait for @realDonaldTrump to whine about the Democrats blocking everything, even though the GOP the majority.
Celebrate! 
I am so glad, that the inefficient trumpcare, is dead now. A medical plan should be put together by medical expertise, no corrupt republican
Trump is a neophyte, who should be criminally prosecuted for betrayal his own country.
How about if the Republicans “collude” with Dem’s on coming up with ACA-2.0? Trump’s familiar with this tactic so should go smoothly.
This staunch @TheDemocrats thanks @lisamurkowski @SenCapito & @SenatorCollins -principled women who placed health of 32mm ppl over GOPpolit.
Also never been more proud of the collective effort of our @TheDemocrats elected officials & marching masses who accomplished the impossible
So sad we're not going to be getting that "beautiful healthcare" DJT promised; the one that would cover everyone AND have lower prems. /s
#NoShortAttentionSpan
#FixTheACA opportunity to work with female GOP senators & Govs to #FixTheAca The people don't want repeal they want #FixTheACA
Amen!

No- but they're working out for the American people!
#Obamacare will collapse on its own as predicted. You and the rest of  the scum sucking liberals own it
Our pockets
Please do the same!  Thanks for what you do.
Not because its good for all because it has Obama tag on it...we need a bill Tht will actually help the citizen of the US without breaking
As long as you keep fighting we will support, want to run for president we are with you
Republican Senators now listening to American people more than Republican leadership. Good job, Americans! 
Obamacare or the real name ACA is very flawed wat it really needs is to be reviewed and redone better...these guys just want to replace it
I'm sooo tired of all their winning 
You are awesome Thanks for fighting for us. #ThankYouKamala
I watched your speech last night was so very excited knowing that the Dems are actually standing up for the American people.Thank you
On it!!!!!!!!
Puts stake thru it's heart.
Good let it keep going into the ground. I bet you still blaim trump somehow. U will start saying how it wasn't "maintained properly"
Trump et al. are actively trying to sabotage ACA. So, yes, Trump is to blame here. So is Tom Price at HHS, as well as McConnell, Ryan, et al
. So much wining.
I'm proud that it's women stepping up in the Senate to do what is right.
Prepare you're resume 2020
Thanks to 3 brave GOP women! Thank you, ladies!
The fight is over when #ALL #Americans have good AND affordable #Health #Care @FoxNews @foxandfriends
Please run!
OK #Resistance next on the Agenda is THURSDAY, if congress and 45 don't appropriate ACA funding it will fail Retweet important
#totalRecall recall the unfit

 @fakeRepresentative 

Vote stupid out of DC
Sen Harris, will you come out with a factual truthful state!ent about what @GOP has done over last 4 months?


It's time to push for single pay.
Half of the Democrats in Congress endorse #MedicareForAll: https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/676/cosponsors … .  Should be more.  Everyone keep telling Congress so.
With each day the resistance to all of the hateful agendas brought forth by the GOP & Pres grows stronger. I will not let up.
Senator keep up the good work
Thank you Senator....This is why I voted for you.  This is why I am grateful you represent us.
LOL! Get better sources than Slate. #Repeal only is not dead. We'll vote out anyone who doesn't vote for it and they know it.
What do you say about the unaffordable premiums for CA tax payers?
Thank you @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @SenCapito . #ElectMoreWomen!
Govt is wasting healthcare $ on ppl w/unhealthy habits
Drug abusers & ppl w/promiscuous sex habits
Christian counselors not allowed to help?
Thanks so much, @KamalaHarris
And the walls come tumbling down.
