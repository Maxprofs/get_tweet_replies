Named after himself, "MEAN"
The Repubs. Healthcare Bill is so catastrophic...
It could advocate for killing the elderly at the age of 70, and STILL it would be better for the nation than the ACA.
What do you plan to contribute to America?
Of course he calls it mean, it's everything he instructed them to put in it. Nothing but another smoke screen so he can blame it on them.
And yet he and House Republicans celebrated its passage in the Rose Garden with beer. What does that say?
That's what his flock wanted and my God they got it. It's just a shame decent ppl have to suffer because of it
Hey meat you haven't seen it yet.
How mean does it have to be for a man who brags about sexual assault to think it's mean ?
We support you. Keep speaking out. Keep these crooks in check.They hate an intelligent black woman. Keep getting in their face
@jjbenz19 Won't stop him from signing it.
But the bill was already horrible and against the middle class but cool for the poor but a lot couldnt afford it nd bn forced to pay
Hold my Cleveland beer.
The guy who celebrated when the House passed the first version of the GOP "health care" bill must be feeling the heat from his supporters.
Save us please
The Democrats and some morally inclined Republicans are the USA's only hope right now.
That's a joke right?
Let's give Trump his proppers then.
We are with you!!! #Kamala2020
I will keep my eye on ya buy choose another party bcuz Dems are not a thing anymore thanks to all of the corruption that needed to come out.
*but
CAPITALIZE ON THE NEGATIVE, DON'T DO ANYTHING POSITIVE FOR OUR COUNTRY. MAYBE YOU SHOULD LEAVE IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT HERE! WE T PPL HV SPOKEN
How can you say this if you haven't seen it yet?
So Trump's Rose Garden ceremony celebrating the House health care bill was a "mean" party.#MAGA #ImpeachTrump #LockHimUp
#MeanCare
He doesn't deserve any credit. Everything he says is designed to benefit himself
Have you seen a draft yet? Most say that TRUMPCARE is not finished yet. Many republicans have not seen it.
He was just playing "good cop" to their "bad cop". I don't believe a word he says. #DonTheCon
My only question to you Kamala is this. What you gonna do? GOP wont oppose this wannabe tyrant, so it's up to the rest of you to stop him.
Work with congress to make it nice.
You don't know.....trump e thief &layer man

#RUSSIAFLFUNDS #MOBTIES #BAYROCK #FELEXSTATER #TRUMPIMPEACHMENT: Obstruction, Dereliction of duty, Money Laundering. Trump will go to jail. 
Tell me what is says??? I'll wait!!
Please @SenKamalaHarris don't call it a "health care bill" it's a "new tax cut for the 1%"-cuts out hospice even @DNC @dncpress @SenateDems
If this is passed watch all the abuse to the disabled and elderly that will start to happen 
ppl are not all trained to care 4 them  :(
Sad
Implying he wouldn't sign it if it passed. The day he vetoes a GOP bill is the day he releases his taxes and the pee tape.
The Repubs want a country that looks like them - old, rich & white.
The Repubs want to wipe out the sick, the elderly, the poor, the physically challenged and the mentally challenged.
Trump seems to have been shocked when someone finally explained the health care to him
The odd thing is: poor healthcare is bad for the business community's bottom line. This tax break won't help rich people
he has no idea what's in bill
Senator, that may be true, but the money to fund the tax cuts he wants for the rich have to come from somewhere. He is responsible for this.
He should know
He called it "mean". Come on he had a beer party for the house R's after their vote. This guy is confused or stupid or both.
#OfficialWhiteHouseStatement from #TheDonald: The #AHCA is "MEAN"
Come on Senator, didn't you hear about Obama care. What about all the secret meetings with Healthcare providers, but no GOP allowed
So #HoldTheFloor  as long as it takes
Referencing Trump's calling the bill mean, is probably what he wants u to do since he may throw the gop under the bus,
Wait an hour, new telenovela script will say its great! Fantastic!
Well he is the epitome of mean so he would know!
Naaa, not again. We got it, Sen. Harris
And yet he was cheering it when it passed the house. He has no idea what was in it! #Clueless #TrumpCare
All representatives should have same health care as the bill they vote on!  They work for us! #TrumpCareKills
Dems MUST withhold consent and filibuster!

#RESIST
@TheDemocrats @SenateDems @SenKamalaHarris @thehill #Trump calling the Senate HC bill 'mean' 'w/out heart' is simply an SOB's disclaimer.
It very well may be. But we know which is for sure, the one that is currently law and is collapsing in many states.
Go Figure!
Sick of those "moderate" Reps who bust out some righteous woo-woo-woo noises but forget their "country 1st" card when its time to vote.
But he will still sign it and a win - then lie about it when negative consequences start coming in.
Of course
and also said it "needs heart"! #Trumpcare
But he'll sign it.
That was House version. Senate version sure 2b cold-blooded toward every healthcare concern of all American's who're sick, from HIV to acne.
If you save us,  I'll drive up and buy you drinks, on behalf of poor teachers everywhere!
Great speech yesterday! Keep up the good work!
MASTER MANIPULATOR CON ARTIST #TRUMP  AT it again FACT CHECK as I recall BIG party in ROSE Garden passage of SAME TRUMP CARE BILL 
I heard we took mean out of context. Always an excuse.
Wow...That's like the Cleveland Browns calling another Football team "bad"

I wonder if he goes back on his word & calls it "fake news."
wouldn't surprise me
#Trump called it a "sonofabitch". #IvankaTrump probably called it "mean" and after reading it probably said "it needed to have more heart"
Donald must said "mean, I love it".
Fight fight back now
Hopefully, we can get #GOP out of office 2018! Need ads showing Dems care for people. #ProtectOurCare #NoHearingNoVote #TrumpcareWillKill
Now that is a hot mess!!
This will be a disaster if passed.
Thank you, Senator Harris! Please keep fighting for Americans, health care, and accountability being lost with Drumpf.
@PressSec says @potus hasn't even seen the bill. SAD.
2020
That's a helluva thing right there. Meeting trumps definition of "mean. "
@ManuelSillas54 let me tell you, senator kamala harris, that you are a very good looking woman. Mixed Hispanic and black.Gorgeous smart.
And trump is soulless so he should be happy
Trump could veto it and cause a stampede. But he won't He is a puts.
USA is catastrophic.  Bunch of white supremacists in the government.
But he'll sign it anyway.
Yet he has done nothing to change it  - Lets focus on #Healthcare! Let's @Twitter #Bomb @WhiteHouse or @POTUS or @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr
@PressSec just lied and said @realDonaldTrump hasn't seen the bill yet.
nothing new trump is known to be a liar
@Grey_Obelisk Devil is usually in the details but in this case the devil is in the smile#TrumpLies LIES LIES LIES!!!
#ShowUsTheBill
 but he meant it in a good way
Are we sure he doesn't being "mean "to the 1% tax payers?
How are seniors going to pay for Medicare if it's increased 3x what we're paying now
Thanks for continuing the fight.
First he said it was great. Now he says it's mean. It's easier to just ignore what DJT says.
67,000.00 dollars Kamala
I don't believe trump called it mean because I don't believe he has a clue whats in it or would even read it
It must be because it doesn't deliver the tax cuts he wanted. Mean to very rich people!
Sen. Harris, I think I need to move to your district.
But it depends on what his definition of "mean" means.  45's "mean" could = Michael Jackson's "Bad."
The man that will put his name on someone else's family crest doesn't want his name on this bill 
#TRUMPCARE #failure again. #incompetent #maga
But with the way words are treated in Trump World, "mean" may not mean "mean"
And ppl are surprised? They told you want they would do. Zero empathy. So tell me how HRC was the worst option?!
Where's your ideas? That's right you have nothing. Why are you even there?
can I get a whu whuuuuuuuuuu?
Oh lord...they don't like trutg
Truth
If Obamacare is so wonderful, how come you and the rest of the crooks we elected are NOT on it? Give us what YOU HAVE! You work for us.
Yet onward Christian soldiers they proceed, all men of foul and ignorant mind.Get ready for hell early with this nimble minded policy making
even Trump also had never read it ... to many pages, not enough pictures.
i dont believe he knows what mean means
i dont believe it....@realDonaldTrump lacks the empathy to know
But never refers to it as Trumpcare so we should always refer to it asTrumpcare.
Wealthcare.
Donald used to talk openly about wanted universal healthcare. I think he is only reluctantly going along with this.

Wrong bill senator!
And he can't even read it.
#Trumpcare is garbage @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr
And no we don't! I don't! Vote people! 2018! Get the bastard out!!
I voted for you, but the politics really need to stop. It only shows how stupid you think your constituents are. #nomorepolitics!
Imagine what he'd think if he made it past the first paragraph...
And he's not ashamed to say it. That yes their healthcare is mean and it's bc their assholes. So we the people just have to take it.
He's calling it mean bc it's way sayin proudly that "they" r glad to be assholes. He's promoting it proudly. It's a figure of speech
Do you believe that he has read the bill? Or did someone "tell him" to say it is "mean"? Thanks for all you do, Senator.
I'm sure he didn't read it! Remember 1 page, 9 bullet points.
Trump could buy some good will with the public with a veto if it passes. But he won't. $$$
Word is he just wants to sign SOMETHING, ANYTHING so his base thinks he's doing something. They don't realize it will hurt them most
But Grifter Trump will sign it because of huge tax cut he will get! Deplorable Spicer says DT is excited! Could care less
He has no clue what he is doing. Is the whole government sober or what! No comments
Maybe there is hope for us.
Good cop, bad cop routine.
And.... do you think Obamacare is good? People in CA are suffering. Do you care Kamala??

Then how about they don't freaking do it
Wonder what he'd say if he knew what was in it.
Has it occurred that they are making it look worse to give Trump a chance to look vaguely heroic?  I'm not buying it.  The fellow is a cad.
When "the king of mean" exclaimed it to be "mean"...it must be catastrophic. Even for him! That speaks volumes
Doesn't matter he will sign whatever HORROR reaches his desk! #StopAHCA

#LicTrump: Trump awol. Trump tax records M.I.A. Trump & Sessions Russia collusion memories K.I.A. Republican Party L.I.A.R.S. "Go figure!" 
Don't be fooled. He knew what it was and praised it. Wants passed for tax cuts but setting up Senate for blame. Knows will affect his core.
OK! TOGETHER, Sen.Kamala Harris
If Trumphole himself, is calling Reb ACHA, "Mean" THAT'S saying A LOT! But ya know what? The SOB skin sack, will sign it anyway!
I bet you a million rubles he doesn't know what's in it.
Does he even know himself what they re doing?
It is austerity, plain and simple. Partisan brand loyalty is a terribly effective weapon as many constituents are applauding their own loss.
so the way I understand it, anyone on any Rx will be considered pre-existing and no longer covered. Sad!
I'm saddened that our president is so elementary in written and verbal expressions.
Have you seen it?
The@GOP is trying to kill me. Without Obama care, my $300 a month is $950.00 and I can't afford it. Lose coverage, I am dead. #daughterwife
Turn these into posters and paste them all over the senate.
It's down right Nasty.
#woke #60k #kamalawaters @RealAlexJones @DewsNewz @Rambobiggs @Cernovich @joerogan @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump
Shut up
Couldn't of said it better myself! Everything that comes out of her mouth is Garbly Gook! Kamala don't grab the raft go down with the ship !
There's no point in even trying to communicate on a realistic level with those people , total waste of time. she's gone 2018 Anyway !
So true! just engaging with them is arduously exasperating! Let's all band together against Sen. Kamala Harris.
That's freaking catastrophic!
Sad!
