"You become responsible forever, for what you have tamed",  - this is a phrase from St. Exupery.
How about you idiots in congress do something with all of the trillions of dollars we pay you?
What is the u.s. government doing to help with distribution. donations  are sitting in a warehouses. Please review and update thank you
#PuertoRico #USA #World needs #OneGlobalEmergencyResponseNetwork 2 provide reliable #EmergencyResponse 2 anyone anytime anywhere. #Support
Want to help Puerto Rico recognize that the USA is not operationally constrained #MMT
When oppressed people of color must cry for help/aide from those obligated to them;then know that that Nation awaits a painful demise!
@SenKamalaHarris please do everything you can to speed aid to Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Americans are dying while Trump tweets.
USS Comfort is still moored off Virginia. How can this be when so many million Americans are in need??
Trump is mad at PR because of his failed golf course
I heard a little about that. Thanks for link. He is cruel enough to punish a whole country.

#ExpandMedicaidNow #Impact
How many aircraft carriers are headed there now to help with water and medical needs?
Sen. Harris - I would support anything you can do to encourage your colleagues to act to help PR! Force the Presidents hand
What a time to live in. When the President is busy fighting the NFL, while the citizens unite to help Puerto Rico.
Airlift everyone to Trump's damned hotels. For free.  Until we can restore pwr, water, sanitation and food supply.
Is the federal government so dysfunctional that we can't reasonably expect it to apply our tax dollars to the cause?
@GaryRayBetz what is our gov doing why don't we see more action? NYPD is there where is FEMA
To the ones with empathy, human decency and common sense, please help!!
Trump won’t waive the Jones Act for PR,  deliberately preventing lifesaving supplies from reaching Americans
He is inhuman and so are the people who agree with him on this.
Can you join John McCain's argument of the Jones Act?
John McCain urges Department of Homeland Security to waive the Jones Act for Puerto Rico to aid recovery efforts in the wake of Maria 
@RickyMartin247  should help too 
Where's real HealthCare we should be sending them care stop 4 one moment republicans & think of humanity

Senator - can't you do something to get aid there quicker? I donated. They need help right now
Have trump donate his billions to Puerto Rico! Con man
Can the Senate or Congress act without waiting for the President? Can the Joint Chiefs send assist. We have military members trained to help
Those in office have pledged loyalty to a Tyrant,&forfeited their duty unto the People!Many will suffer for such an odious State of Affairs!
Yes! Donating 20% including 5% fee of https://www.gofundme.com/helpjenandpr  to @HispanicFed #PuertoRico if trump won't help, this disabled woman will!
Tell you what everyone for every like I get I'll donate .50 cents to a Maria hurricane relief effort for Puerto Rico  #borriqueno
Cutoff date is two weeks from the original post
Thank you, Ms. Harris for remembering. They are still in dire straits.
Sucks so much that American citizens have to suffer and can’t vote for change
tell donald! He seems to be fighting with the #NFL rather than helping US Citizens!
What,no statehood means no state
Senator Harris---Would you consider going there? Take  other Senators with you? trump isn't going. Actually, that's probably a good thing.
Plz retweet w/hashtag #SendTheComfort & sign this petition: 
The President is far too busy working through his long hate list

Didn't Puerto Rico vote for Hillary...maybe that's part of @realDonaldTrump lack of enthusiasm towards PR.
Shouldn't matter when you are dealing with peoples lives, but to Trump it is.
https://twitter.com/PiyushAg678/status/912701528686784514 …
Please help if you can, there, but for the grace of God, go all of us !!
And we have 45 blaming them in the time of crisis.. I wonder y

Apparently our president doesn't subscribe to that belief.
Could you ask that guy in the WH too send this?
I get taxed like 40% of my income and am very near homelessness. Why ask poor folk to help? Get your rich friends on it, send campaign $.
The government needs to get it together and get out there.
You are so right Kamala! We have to pull together to help PR!
If our own President  won't help , maybe our allies will.... @JustinTrudeau
Senator get the Senate of their racist asses and send the Navy & Army Engineers in to help these people. 
Dotard Trump & his minions =2 PR
I've given what wee bit I got..wish it was so much more..
Senator Harris -- why is Puerto Rico not getting aid? We have all the powerful ways to do this...
Senator Harris where is the Navy in all of this, I would ask Trump but he doesn't know too buy with the NFL
Is anyone going to tell @realDonaldTrump the secret about Puerto Rico? Then explain the colony thing? I don't think he realized until today!
If congress is fine with stripping health insurance away from millions of Americans, then I doubt they'll help Puerto Ricans
And the Virgin Islands r part of America, & they need disaster relief. 
#RacistInChief #RacistInChief #RacistInChief #RacistInChief #RacistInChief #RacistInChief #RacistInChief #RacistInChief #RacistInChief
It's time for Congress to force the WH to get help for #Hurricane victims.
And time for America to #TakeAKnee in prayer for Puerto Rico.
Pls help our brown brothers n sisters
@KamalaHarris another way of also helping Puerto Rico
Donating, ty for providing the information.
so.......how about OUR government doing something? Why isn't help on the way for them?
Vote for a necessary financial package to help. It is necessary
Senator Harris, go around 45 and do something for the people of Puerto Rico!
of course someone is blaming the president
Are flights leaving out of there? Can I host a family or somerging
@Charmed86 @jbendery please forward to the President he dint get the memo
Agree!! Priorities would be great right now!!
Yes.  Thanks for offering a way for us to help.
.@realDonaldTrump if you find out there are white Puerto Ricans on the island, then will you send sufficient aid quicker?
I'm a constituent. WHERE IS THE GOVERNMENT AID FOR PUERTO RICO? It needs to happen yesterday. Please and thank you!
Because the US government is not...
Any information yet on how to help the U.S. Virgin islands. 
Please advise ie reliable resources/places to give.
IT IS FUNNY THAT  HEAD CRYS ABOUT NFL WHEN HE SHOULD B FOCUSED ON PUERTO RICANS WHO R FACING LIFE AND DEATH SITUATIONS..REALLY SAD
You can't have people who are on dialysis waiting 2 days in a hot airport without medical care.
Why isn't the President and Congress? Trump is so busy attacking black NFL players and is totally ignoring Americans in Puerto Rico.
Its time for the feds to help.
Sen. Harris, I respectfully disagree; Puerto Ricans are IN crisis!
In a country with such wealth this is ridiculous. These are human beings but the republicans are busy trying to kill poor people right here.
YOU NEED TO SEND MILITARY TRANSPORT OPERATIONS TO GET THOSE PEOPLE OUT BEFORE THERE IS AN OUTBREAK OF CHOLERA IN THOSE CONDITIONS!!!!!!
Please tell trump to do the same...
Why isn't the federal government doing more?
Please also remember those in the Virgin Islands severely impacted by hurricanes Irma and Maria
Congress needs to do their part and put together a robust aid package. It’s crying shame.
i pledge never to vote for a corporate sponsored politician again. that way, we won't all be so poor in the first place 
Thank you for highlighting the catastrophes in Puerto Rico. They need aid NOW
#HelpPuertoRico
Websites to Donate for #PuertoRico
https://hispanicfederation.org/donate 
http://unidosporpuertorico.com/en/ 
It seems like Puerto Rico is the "step child" compared to Texas to Florida.  There's no news about Federal help in PR
Isn’t it Amazing that 47% of Americans don’t know that? http://www.suffolk.edu/documents/SUPRC/3_7_2017_marginals.pdf …
We need our Congress to set up to the plate and do their job.

This is what PR is going through we need all the help we can get.
Please if you are going to donate, donate directly to organizations that are giving their money directly to PR, like http://unidosporpuertorico.com/en/ 
Someone should remind 45 that Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory He needs to send active duty troops and equipment there to help.
If that had been  Hawaii everybody would have swarmed to their aid
Why didn’t @fema have cargo planes filled with drinking water? A no-brainer. A definite necessity to life. A resources needed but not there!
FEMA AND THE RED CROSS IS SUPPOSED TO HELP.  I HAVE MY OWN PROBLEMS
While Trump argues over matters he should leave alone, PR should be treated as part of the continental US and not an ocean away!
These are the times when America needs a President....who cares for America and its people...you haven`t got that with the Trump.
When will the government help? @HillaryClinton said send the Navy! Make it happen please. Puerto Rico 
Saw a tweet earlier saying the WH won't send request for funding until 1st or 2nd week of October. They need to get off their asses, Now.
#PuertoRico .@Latism_NYC #Borinquen #PuertoRicoRelief
Please Senator include the US Virgin Islands in this as well. Neither can wait for help from all of us.
Why isn't the Navy there, with cargo ships full of provisions and hospital ships?  Americans shouldn't be at the mercy of charity.
Thank you. Can help by waving the Jones Act during this crisis?The act prevents foreign ships from docking in island to offload goods.
Pass real Chapter 9 bankruptcy for PR & scrap PROMESA - it's TOO risky to have appointed board. Trump could appoint even worse people!
I am having a fundraiser for PR as well, and you can own some photography of the island in the process! 
I am selling 8x10 prints from my trip to #PuertoRico. All profits will go towards @carmeloanthony’s Hurricane Relief Fund, RT to spread word 
The fiscal control board's priorities were austerity measures: cutting vital labor & infrastructure - they made problem worse.
Claro telecom was too cheap to provide guards at cell towers - this is the cost of vulture privatization.
People have gone days without clean drinking water in the smaller towns!
Airlines are price gouging people with impunity.
Need Fema to waive 25% cost sharing of aid!
There are forward stockpiles that can save lives 
#PuertoRico is a distribution hub for US retail chains
.@amazon .@walmart .@target .@sears 
There's warehouses full of life-sustaining retail mech being WRITTEN OFF FOR INSURANCE in #PuertoRico
Please propose immediate aid to help Puerto Ricans. Our fellow Americans need emergency aid on a GOVT level. It's a humanitarian crisis.
Dear everyone, it doesn't cost you a million dollar to donate It just takes one . Donate one dollar to help them rebuild
#littleorangeman
I donated money and I make less than 35k/yr POTUS is a billionaire and how much has he donated? 0$$? Whaaaattttt?!?!?!........not surprised
Where's @POTUS now oh yea that's right the Latino vote doesn't matter to him guys he doesn't care about us only the immediate US territories
It's interesting, you Dems just discovered PR this morning. What did you do, decide to up it together as TP for the day?
At a time when we have pleaded our President to tweet about this, we are thankful for your compassion! #PuertoRico 
You have power. YOU DO SOMETHING TO HELP.
Senators only have power with the support of other Senators. That's why the president is so crucial in times of crisis.
Thank you. Still have not heard from some family members on the island. This is a desperate time for many
Send USNavy Ship Comfort!!!!
If they are our fellow Americans, and have family they can stay with on the mainland than perhaps we should offer an airlift.
Otherwise why isn't disaster relief flying in by the plane load?
I guess this is one of those times where @POTUS claims his team is doing a great job?
Sadly, Trump and his grifter family won't do anything until they can figure out how to profit off of the relief efforts. #PuertoRico
Thank you!!! 
Is the Red Cross there?
Why isn't our government helping them?
How can we help influence more governmental aid as well?
Just sent in my check to

Salvation Army
PO Box 1959
Atlanta, GA
30301

on check
Puerto Rico
Hurricane 2017
Why is their plight being ignored by FEMA and @realDonaldTrump? Isn't there some action the Senate can take to get aid there NOW?
Tell that to our president
We better help because DipshiT is worrying about the #NFL instead of presidential matters.
Thanks, Kamela. Let's make this happen. Give
What about you he crisis in Chicago you and the rest of the liberal democrats ignore! 2800 shot yr to date!!!
Thank you, Sen. Harris! Realy ways to help our fellow Americans in PR. It's up to the ppl because it seems like our R govt won't do anything
Ricans lower than negroes
Senator, meanwhile, what is Congress doing to provide US government aide to over 3.5 million US citizens in PR & USVI? Help NOW!!
and what are you doing to help, Senator
I gave!
When your on the floor today demand the President do his job.
Ms Harris, I know today healthcare is the focus but each minute that goes by endanger our fellow citizens, after donating,how can we help
Why haven't we mobilized the hospital ship, CARE?
As in "Force the #DotardTrump to do HIS job"? How do we do that? First, he'd have to give a . Maybe if we renamed the island Trumpo Rico?
PLEASE ASK THEM TO CONTINUE TO WAVE THE JONES ACT
BLESS YOU 
If you want to see how the Trump GOP will respond to a Blue Coast earthquake disaster, keep your eyes on Puerto Rico. #PuertoRicoRelief
Sad our President is too engrossed with demeaning black athletes to help Puerto Rico
Any chance we can add the Virgin Islands to that
Apparently Brown Lives Don't Matter to @realDonaldTrump . What a surprise.
What is Congress doing Senator?
45 has the resources our 3.5 American citizens in #PuertoRico need. Until government does its job, we will. Plz give 
Please call on the Feds to send in military aid now.  Donations will come too late. Thank you!
Another story ignores US citizens in need 2wks after TWO hurricanes

#USVI #StJohn #StThomas #StCroix abandoned/forgotten by US govt & media
You retweet the huff and Trump retweets breitbart, wth is going on?
Senator, please do anything you can to get an aid bill into consideration ASAP. We can't (and shouldn't) risk people dying.
Please get the President on board with serious help for them
I'm happy--and morally obligated--to help. What help are Congress and the WH offering?
U too!

So Very True should hv been President Hilary!

I donated through @GlobalGiving  very highly rated and secure way to get the money where it’s supposed to go.
Help us. Puerto Rico w/o power, water, gas for generators, cash to purchase what is available, communications collapsed.
Yes this is the urgent need. Power, water, food, fuel, communications, volunteers! #PuertoRicoRelief #TrumpsKatrina
Yes in these min @SenKamalaHarris, your tweet (notification) (Family) TRUTHFULLY, this morning UP early; Post Office (more).
1:30pm. @SenKamalaHarris @CSPAN 2 U.S. Senate Finace Committee Hearing on the GRAHAM-CASSIDY  Health Care Bill, TRUTH
Are we sending aid and assistance to Puerto Rico like we did to Texas and Florida? If not, why not?
I love how tRump is not helping...these ppl are suffering.
Which one of these actually donates to people in need as opposed to spending it on “administration costs”?
We can't get our donated money into PR to provide aid. What can Congress do to get military ships in there with medicine and food? Dunkirk.

#TrumpRussia - Here's the WHOLE story
Let's make it VIRAL

Make no mistake...We are at war - #TheResistance…
SenatorI dont agree w/ U of10 but PR took D most devastating brunt of D 3 hcanes. TX & FL 4tunate w/ gr8 Govs & resources, not enuff n PR
But to @POTUS &@GOP govt, prime real estate is cheap when there's blood&death in the streets. Watch the land grab happen. He doesn't care.
Nobody is talking about this!!
Here's what a real leader does in order to deal with a crisis.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has enlisted Jennifer Lopez to help raise money for hurricane relief in Puerto Rico http://nyti.ms/2y2HFMc  
Thank you Sen. Harris!
Thank you Kamala!!!
What can congress do here?
How about we send this to the Hill & WH
If you want @ElonMusk to set up solar hubs all over #PuertoRico to help them recover from this catastrophe, like & RT!

#PuertoRicoSolar
Naw we are worried about the @NFL and people standing up for songs.
IT IS
"Do you understand this is a humanitarian crisis?" 1,000 people waiting in line to leave Puerto Rico - sleeping children are sweating 
Thank you! Please don't forgot about them!
* Because @realDonaldTrump will do nothing.
I donated to the Hispanic Federation. Hopefully it's not a scam.
Please read this thread that describes the horrific plight of our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico:
 Extremely disturbing news from #PuertoRico just now ...
