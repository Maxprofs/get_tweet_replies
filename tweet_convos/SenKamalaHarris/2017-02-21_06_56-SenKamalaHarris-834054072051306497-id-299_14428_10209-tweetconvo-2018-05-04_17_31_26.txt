@Trumpnado2016 @SenSchumer @washingtonpost no @SenateMajLdr as a part of the investigation either, he's part of the coverup
There is nothing to investigate - he was just doing his job! #Disliked
W/respect, you're both stating the obvious. What are Senate Dems doing to force the issue?
See below, it's part of the DOJ LAW he HAS TO:
Only way to force him is states filing lawsuits themselves,no people w/morality
States always have recourse
@tedbird8 @SenSchumer @washingtonpost. You brain dead if you agree w Schumer.He is Putins cousin you know !
Welp...
@dcasapwarren @SenSchumer @washingtonpost
@BradReason @SenSchumer @washingtonpost CES has no clout and is 2b named in #pizzagate arrests very soon!!!
@AvalynnSmith @SenSchumer @washingtonpost Sen Schumer will go against everything GOP. I am thankful the DNC is struggling!
You mean like the time when you recused yourself from @ppact investigations while supporting them?
http://fxn.ws/2fOwqhx  @EuphoricEuler @SenSchumer
Meanwhile in a parallel universe....  the following is passed round http://www.neonnettle.com/features/735-us-homeland-security-confirms-that-pizzagate-is-100-real …
, "He also oversaw the case against Jeffrey Epstein"  https://wpo.st/iV9d2  @SenKamalaHarris @SenSchumer

So, shouldn't AG Lynch have assigned Special Prosecutor after meeting with Bill Clinton on tarmac?
@TheDailyEdge ...Jeff Sessions should recuse himself from the AG office.
@MatiasFmatias @SenKamalaHarris @SenSchumer @washingtonpost @TheDailyEdge He should probably recuse himself from the human race
He has to BE a member of the human race to recuse himself from it. Proof not entered info evidence
yeah:

But Schumer is the Mitch McConnell of the Democratic party.. it's always an underhanded thing with him.
@electrotech11 @SenSchumer @washingtonpost I am #TheResistance
@HanSolo_2017 @SenSchumer @washingtonpost THE fact the doesn't want to, speaks volumes of corruption!
Jeff Sessions is a rabid Skwerl!!!

(Right? I mean that was the point, right?)
Squirrels almost never get rabies. Sessions just has a legal duty to recuse.
Oh, well, evil
Evil isn't rabid. This crew is evil. Gotta check the book on what to do
you'd agree with Chuckie if he said the sky was green
@GeorgeTakei @SenSchumer @washingtonpost Really? Where were u through the corruption of Holder? Lynch? Now you care?
As. IF. Any Greedy Old Patricians give a damn. They are in power & ttly complicit in the coup.
@ManMet80 @SenSchumer @washingtonpost he needs to resign. Can't keep having Trump cabinet members lie under oath and remain
@GeorgeTakei @SenSchumer @washingtonpost  bahahaha go figure- liberal bias
maybe she wants her "occult police force" to help out ...
Chances are he won't and will get in the way. He was in on it.
@igggie1 @SenSchumer @washingtonpost
why, Holder & Lynch protected Obama's ass for 8 years and liberals went along with it!
The DNC got rid of the special council after Clinton was impeached. Reap what you sow.
@SocialPowerOne1 @SenSchumer @washingtonpost Grey old unethical Bama Fox guarding the chicken coop.
There’s an investigation?
Granny Schumer BS.
@In4mdCndn @SenSchumer @washingtonpost. So must @jasoninthehouse
Why not vote to impeach Sessions if he doesn't. Even if it fails, it raises the level of protest.
this is a no brainer!
Sessions' ethics should be questioned by the Bar.
@GeorgeTakei @SenSchumer @washingtonpost @jeffsessions Do the right thing: Recuse
@thelovemaster @SenSchumer @washingtonpost he won't cuz they're all corrupt. We're a banana republic.
has to be asked, if Shummie told you to eat Kale, and then sing from the top of the Empire State Bldg, would you do it?
this is a Captain Obvious request considering they're all Captain Oblivious/Insidious  he won't
@Mark_E_Hudak @SenSchumer @washingtonpost or he can stay on and go down with him.
@GeorgeTakei @SenSchumer @washingtonpost if you agree with @SenSchumer , then you are
@GeorgeTakei @SenSchumer @washingtonpost It will not be legitimate if he doesn't. Not even close.
@ChicoAJBIII thank you Chico love you thank you keep up the good wort Ty
@ChicoAJBIII yes he he's to
@TinaGerow @SenSchumer @washingtonpost 

HAHAH....
How soon we forget
@FBI director Comey & @AGLynch
protecting YOUR QUEEN
SESSIONS SAUD HE WILL NOT.
And y'all already know he won't, so what's the plan? @SenKamalaHarris  @SenSchumer @washingtonpost
play by rules,pat themselves on the back for being ethical while the world burns
@ShercoSherrill @SenSchumer @washingtonpost No question. Since he was part of the campaign, he'll have to.
I agree, but tweets aren't going to move the needle.
Sessions was an early supporter of DJT. Who knows. He may know something & may need to testify!
@GeorgeTakei @SenSchumer @washingtonpost @CNN @MSNBC @WSJ I'm begging #Congress to subpoena Trump's tax returns. #Impeach45
It must be Independent!
@GeorgeTakei @SenSchumer actually its illegal to be apart of it.
Loretta Lynch should have recused herself from Hillary Clinton investigation. So, no. Not at all.
@tee_more4 @SenSchumer @washingtonpost There shouldn't be an investigation if Hillary can have a private server
No. Loretta Lynch and Eric Holder were guilty of overlooking voter intimidation and then IRS intimidation.
Say the right spell, near running water, under a full moon and he must return to his dark master!
@GeorgeTakei @SenSchumer I agree and it will be GOP senators are deciding to ignore this!
I disagree with the amount of eyes on him he has no choice but to be fair. a good way to prove himself
ABSOLUTELY!!
Kinda like the Republicans thought Lynch should recuse herself from the Clinton investigation? Tit for tat.
@wilw @SenSchumer @washingtonpost but you know he won't tho right? Recusal means he'll actually do something right. Nope.
Kamala, I can't think of anytime I've ever agreed with anything you've done except go after sex trafficking. @SenSchumer
@wtfnewsamerica @SenSchumer @washingtonpost This is your most important issue?  Seriously?
Isn't tweeting fake participation?  Wouldn't it be better to ask constituents to write/call to document?
@wilw @SenSchumer @washingtonpost don't think there is any hope of that
don't we need independent counsel or special prosecutor or some such?
@AvalynnSmith @SenSchumer @washingtonpost without question.
@GreatDismal @SenSchumer who gives a fuck?? There's nothing to investigate..I mean pleeeze
@GeorgeTakei @SenSchumer @washingtonpost
@GeorgeTakei @SenSchumer @washingtonpost x no Sessions on investigation
@GeorgeTakei @SenSchumer @washingtonpost agreed. Justice must appear to be done
needs to recuse himself out of america.
He won't though. There is no attempt at the appearance of morality here
@GeorgeTakei @SenSchumer I agree. Recuse ur self sir. Excuse me sir, recuse ur self sir. Sir
So @SenKamalaHarris perhaps @SenSchumer should not have voted yes on @jeffsessions to begin with...
@GeorgeTakei @SenSchumer @washingtonpost Sessions needs to recuse himself from this planet.
local DAs should recuse themselves from homicides by city police, too
YES! @USAGSessions should recuse himself from Flynn investigation
we should save the time and money and they should all recuse themselves.
please keep putting pressure on these cowards.
How's the investigation into Mnuchin's  bank going?
Sessions should recuse himself from the US we would all be alot better off! #TheResistance
Since these guys were ahole buddies in the tRump campaign, how could he NOT recuse himself?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AooOsZx8HVM … he didn't seem shy about it here. seemed very honest.
Tweets alone won't persuade him Senator...
To be fair - I asked Sessions to recuse himself. He said he doesn't know what that means. 
Does Sessions know what that means?
@cd5762 @SenSchumer @washingtonpost this is a no brainer
Thus the problem
term limits are also an important topic
@HowardSchamest @SenSchumer @washingtonpost Actually, in light of today's revelations, he should resign.
.@dcbergin56 @SenKamalaHarris @SenSchumer @washingtonpost Sessions has taken the quick exit off the moral highway.
People like you will lead us to a resolution! #TrumpRussia
he should recuse bc he's also under Russian control.
.@SenKamalaHarris .@SenSchumer Sessions should recuse self from Flynn Investigation. Problem is, he has no spine. #Tremendous #Unfit #Bigly
So freaking obvious. Sessions was major part of campaign. Anything other than recusal is crimnal
and anything other than @OversightDems taking charge of this is an admission of complicity
I think Sessions should hang with him, literally. I hope he retires in disgrace.

What stops a Trump pardon?
Good question. If Flynn is investigated and Trump pardons him it'll be more proof of treason.
@CFenlonEng @SenSchumer @washingtonpost Most definitely if they expect ANY CREDIBILITY.
@Merrirrro @SenSchumer @washingtonpost RT RT RT
no question yes move aside
fuck a RT it's time for real work MAKE A SPEECH! Get off twitter and do something!
Kamala i think you need to speak up more bout the @StandingRockST and DAPL is what i think.
@jeffsessions Agree must RECUSE himself Flynn investigation. Personal interest,unfairness.
And the chances of that happen are 1 in "what r you gonna do about it?"
agree
you need duct tape over your mouth.
No way Jose
@runesrevenge @SenSchumer
PLEASE See #TrumpRussia Ties Span 40 yrs
DT's doing biz in Russia Facts
@funder & @Khanoisseur
Sessions introduced Carter Page. He absolutely must recuse himself.
@JK_Columbus @SenSchumer @washingtonpost No Flynn invest,its a big game & DIMMS being palyed.Hes rootin out govt DEMSPIES
Oh heavens. Alphabet soup w/ gibberish balls. Bye now!
Make America Educated Again!
If Sessions doesn't Recuse,
Then he proves he's a tool.
He can be removed, too.
Flush 'em!
Hey tough guy- your most recent electoral strategy sure worked out well. #YourLastTerm #tytlive #NoBanNoWall
investigate Sessions separately that will take him out of the way to the other investigations
Jeff Sessions has no business being in the position he found himself in...needs to recuse himself from WashDC
This should be a no-brainer.
True but wll he? No, just like Clarence Thomas wouldn't recuse himself from his conflict of interest cases.
@Jillie1949 @SenSchumer @washingtonpost So do I FWIW!
Jeff Sessions must retreat to his tree to make cookies.
@JillElizabethG @SenSchumer @washingtonpost Sessions has no integrity. Not going to recuse. Was installed to ratify coup.
most definitely I agree.
Do SOMETHING about this EVIL REPUBLICAN CONGRESS and SENATE... 
Complete TRAITORS to our COUNTRY...
It is malfeasance and lack of ethics pure and simple.
@VeraHiggs @SenSchumer @washingtonpost of course he should recuse!He is connected to Carter Page. Sessions should b invest
Yes, he should, but what if he doesn't? What is the process of making it so?
It should have been a mandate he not be involved.
@IsaLeeWolf @SenSchumer thank you senator.
of course he has to. He was part of the transition team,worked with flynn, and pushed for job.
@MOVEprofPHD @SenSchumer @washingtonpost As a Californian, I am ashamed to have Kamala Harris "representing" me.
then move...
No one can represent you but you.
An absolute YES. HUGE conflict of interest!
@Deltavogue @SenSchumer @washingtonpost Absolutely! No other way if we're going to have an impartial investigation.
He's probably implicated somehow...
Agree
did you say this when AG Lynch was investigating @HillaryClinton?  The gentleman from NY didn't.  #goose&gander
@terry7531 @SenSchumer @washingtonpost trump lapdog
He spent another weekend in FL. While his cronies deleted,shred& altered evidence.
I agree
He won't recuse.  It is for this circumstance that he was hired.
@Amplitude350Lee @SenSchumer @washingtonpost  Please take it to the Senate. Don't take a knife to a gunfight.   INSIST
to hell with the rules, grand jury timd
@VetsAgnstTrump @SenSchumer @washingtonpost if he doesn't Americans will MUST shine a hot white light on him
Even then it's a mockery, we need an independent investigation.
Most definitely!
Does anyone believe that he has conscience enough to do this? It will have to be done legally.
They are Too Close For Confront!
i hear they are just going to put Flynn in charge of the Flynn investigation
thank you
Agree! Thank you. @SenKamalaHarris @SenSchumer @washingtonpost
agree 100%! I'm shocked at the blatant lies, coverup, collusion, and treason that we've seen!
it's not just Flynn the rot goes way beyond him
you'll eat your words, Senator.  get with the Trump train or your career is over
@_amckean @SenSchumer @washingtonpost Government shouldn't be based on RTs
But has anyone in this administration done the right thing so far?
@DearAuntCrabby @SenSchumer No brainer!! #RECUSE or be EXCUSED for good!
@TheRealDebbie @SenSchumer @washingtonpost Please push Intel COMITO subpoena Trump's tax returns!
Sessions should recuse himself from the trump administration. RACISTS!
So we Retweet.  What's really going to happen. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.
Schumer, when not pushing Grammas out of the way to get in front of a camera, is mostly wrong
How about the entire Trump administration recuses itself. Best idea I've had all year 
#AttorneyGeneralJimCrow should recuse himself. Life in #Trumpistan
the fact that u agree w/Schumer tells me all I need to know about you..radical leftist !
I totally agree

Maybe Flynn should meet Sessions on the Tarmac & discuss the grandkids. #DemStyle @SenKamalaHarris @SenSchumer
I agree with @SenSchumer, Jeff Sessions must recuse himself from the Flynn investigation. Retweet if you do too. https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/chuck-schumer-jeff-sessions-must-recuse-himself-from-the-flynn-investigation/2017/02/21/ddecef5c-f556-11e6-8d72-263470bf0401_story.html?utm_term=.7aa6687dcf8a …
@CaseyHinds @SenSchumer @washingtonpost Agree!
@jeffsessions  
Sessions knows he must recuse himself. Sessions: #DoYourJob
he shouldn't recuse himself at all Schumer is a lowly douchebag he needs to recuse himself from the human race
Sessions is going to prison with Donny when this is all over 

@SenKamalaHarris @SenSchumer @washingtonpost
@DavidYankovich @SenSchumer @washingtonpost only if it means Trump does not appoint replacement
Notably, Sessions is reportedly the one who introduced Carter Page to Trump
e
@floridarocket @SenSchumer @washingtonpost : right - this definitely requires an independent prosecutor
He cannot possibly be impartial.
Jeff Sessions shouldn't be the AG. Then he wouldn't have to recuse himself.
Unfortunately, we are  "losers" so we don't have right to make any demands. Ask Mitch McConnell.
omg for Pete's sake he brought miller on board
Yes, but you know the Fuhrer won't allow him to.
He won't. DT has SCOTUS, DOJ in his pocket. GOP top brass too. This will be a show investigation.
Yes definitely
looks like Session's hand has healed
Do you remember when the black panthers showed up at the voting location intimidating...
...white voters?Did Eric Holder recuse himself?No, he made sure it never went court.No recusal!
