#GOP #Rep_DevinNunes vote NO 4 #AHCA Keep & Improve #ACA! We are watching & voting soon! #ProtectOurCare #ResistTrumpCare
They stopped because of our calls, not your calls.  We want #FullRepeal.  #MAGA
We're going to let Obama care totally collapse!
Wasn't your calls that did it. Its bcos Junky Obamacare cant be fixed. Repeal & Replace only solution !
@missmayim @realDonaldTrump next time to keep the likes of you and other democrats out who support the illuminati agenda
@missmayim @realDonaldTrump he has done more in 60 odd days than Obummer did the whole time. Shame on you, Obummer, and
 "YES..."  

#HealthCare should be a right for ALL "Americans..." 

#PowerToThePeople

#Resistance "Works..." 
Republicans have bill HR307 grants them/staff Golden Parachute healthcare- REMOVE THIS BILL! HEALTHCARE  is ALL OR NONE, sweethearts!
wrong, misleading.  It was postponed because it was a shitty bill with no support. POTUS misled by  Ryan. #draintheswamp
are they waiting for 2 am? Jared and Ivanka to be done skiing? For society to have its attention taken by something else?
@missmayim @realDonaldTrump do the American public a favour though I wouldn't have voted for Trump I'm warming up 2 him
#KILLTHEBILL
My reps have evidently decided the best strategy is turn off the phone and voicemail, ignore calls/emails. #cowards #AHCA
how is it a setback for anyone but the american people
@limitlesskait @cindyrelish call call call
please call.  As an R i stand w my Senator Rand Paul to vote No
The base of both Trump & DEMs is not happy with Healthcare. Needs cost reduction (18% of GDP)
@anniebscrappy If the no vote is because  extreme Repubs want even more damage to people,  who is "winning"?
Hopefully not extreme right wing. If so, women, the poor, disabled and children all lose to greed.
Beautiful!
WE CALLED & TOLD THEM TO REMOVE ALL PARTS OF OBOMACARE
And try #ResistBot to get around busy phone lines! Free & easy!
@Alyssa_Milano They postponed because the far right wants a less watered down plan. Good for them / us.
@Alyssa_Milano thx for the number. I have been calling to support the bill. And get rid of the disaster of Obamacare.
@Alyssa_Milano Weird how u r now against what is basically Obamacare 2.0. Huh.
Phone system malfunctioning. Trying to call, but it won't accept zip code and won't accept 0 option.
@HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan Vote on #AHCA like your political future depends on it. & It does. #VoteNoOrOutIn18
no they don't care about the Dems one bit. Dems lost all the way around. Get your shit together
My rep's mailbox is FULL!
"DON'T STOP BELIEVING"   WE CAN DO THIS PEOPLE....WE CAN DO THIS!!!!!!!!
I've got years of SS and Medicare withholding paid in. I understand that my money helps someone else now--I expect that too
when it's my turn. So tell Ryan and McConnell and Trump and the boys to cut the s#!t.
@AnastasiaBarzee wouldn't it have been better to have them vote and fail?
keep up the fight! Hopefully there's more to come #impeach
@quinncy I called today and I'll call tomorrow.  They work for us!!
@jtkirklin And remind them of this: Kansas state GOP expanding Medicaid in the face of #Trumpcare
@AP @RepJohnFaso NY representative John Faso's voice mail is always full. How can he represent me if he doesn't listen?
I mean, actually, they postponed because of the freedom caucus, who want something 100% worse than what's on the table.
But this should be over. There should be NO voting, NO nominations, NO security clearance til Russia resolved
calling from Huntington Beach!
@AndyRichter called left a message let's keep it going
Oh, it'll be repealed. Just no one can stand the pile of dogfood that is the current bill. So yes, for now...
Are you sure they didn't delay because the "Freedom Caucus" doesn't think it's cruel enough yet? I've heard it both ways.
This disabled senior cannot afford long distance. #SAVEMYMEDICAID
Thank you, Senator. Thank you for helping me live.
Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I will keep calling.
during break, lunch, afternoon break.... keep calling 201-224-3121
This dreadful Health care bill that serves the rich   is a stain of shame on The Republican Party,flaming avarice!
unfortunately @Rep_Hunter is so far up Trump's backside, he'll vote yes, even as his ship is sinking with the DOJ
Rep Lance's mail box is full
#answertoprayers
@lafloran @GOP
Thank you Senator Harris you are appreciated and we thank you too for standing with us. Bless you Senator.
It's funny - you can TALK to the Democrats that you call...although I did talk to Congressman Buddy Carter's liaison, Luke.
|| B-4 you break your arm patting yourself on the back... Bear in mind that @marklevinshow listeners called in also. #MAGA
Well, y'all said call - so we did!!!
@DaMinoshow I'm gonna call the minute I get off the bus!!! 
Not because of our calls, but because the Freedom Caucus doesn't think it's bad enough yet; want more cuts.
I called (202) 224-3121 to protest repeal of Obamacare which enriches wealthy on backs of 99% $$ + their healthcare options
Spoke w/ @DorisMatsui asst(?) I work in a Hosp mat/newborn unit The impact this will have is immeasurable.
which reps in CA need a call?
- Maybe they postponed the vote because they did not want to ram through bad legislation like the Dems did with O'care. 
@DaShanneStokes Now get them outta there!
The Resistance is working! #ResistTrumpCare #ProtectOurCare #SavetheACA #TheResistance
finally a hint of sanity
@DaShanneStokes Do either of you feel it's just a Trump initiated tactic to pressure with threats?
Thank you for standing up for us!!
YEP!  We have to maintain the pressure and keep calling!!!
YAY!!!
they're fighting amongst themselves. Has nothing to do with Democrats.
#NoAHCA #SavetheACA Affordable Care Act. Freedom Caucus YOU'RE OUT 11/2018.
.@SenKamalaHarris 
Mine refuse to tell me how they will vote. I followed by politely asking them to vote no. What more can I do ?
That is TOTALLY the right thing to do! DO AGAIN 2MORROW! MY REP is Ruby Red, but a I call wkly, if not more!
Even just calling once a day, GOP reps sound SO annoyed. That means it's working?
1) ACually, I have been advised to ALWAYS b polite to the staffers who answer. It's usually the newest staff
2)mber thst gets this task. I akways ask whom I'm speaking with, converse a bit, and then say, "pls give the
3)Sen/Congressmn this message, "........". Then I thank the person & thsnk them 4 their time.
Being respectful & polite is key. But, I ALWAYS ask who I am speaking with. That gives u ammo if needed.
Nah they aren't rude, just annoyed...Who knows what their work day is like! Can't be easy...
YES!

Devin Nunes has most of his net worth tied up in a company that does business in Russia http://www.palmerreport.com/news/russia-devin-nunes-donald-trump/2019/ … via @PalmerReport
I understand the business is a Calif winery that does business w/Russians w/ties to Putin. OMG
@zoomer46 finally someone tweets correct #
while GOP lawmakers turn off their phones, Dems advertise the phone #. The contrast is uncanny. Keep it up and #resist !
Leave a v-message, email, or tweet. SO IMPORTANT! P.S. How does something "trend?" This needs to do so!

Now we have to keep them from joining forces with Rand to propose something even worse. Where are you on universal care?
Please remind everyone that *we* don't care what promise they ran on,we want health security.Constituent Pro:Con msg ratio?
yeah!
So.  Much.  Winning.
Lol! I'm tired of winning!
. The resistance is working.   There is a stench coming from this WH.
It's not you are being lied to...
