NEW: 78% of the public, including 52% of Republicans, want the Trump administration to make the #ACA work http://kaiserf.am/2voEjjZ  
Now how about you giving up your attacks on single-payer and equal justice?
If Sanders folk think we're going to forget their abusive attacks on us Democrats when it comes time to elect our nominee, they're wrong.
All you gotta do is not push another corporate shill war-hawk on a tired public. You're not Democrats, you're a Republican's wet dream.
That said, we democrats will elect a democrat for our candidate next primary. Sanders will lose again, probably by more than 3.7 mil. votes
Sure, as long as the DNC works with the corporate-chosen candidate to defraud over 13 million Democrats again, I guess you're right.
I appreciate you're concerns with the DNC, but on the eve of a possible nuclear conflict, it's replace trump at any cost.
"at any cost" is what bin-Laden predicted. Have fun throwing away your rights to protect a corrupt party and racist system.
Nice, but the world comes first, internal politics be damned. Besides, I wouldn't rely on Bin Laden for predictive advice.
Did you just call Obamacare "Affordable"? WHAT PLANET do you live on?
It's not about the law! It never was. It's about what a black man was able to accomplish that eluded the white man for so long!
Make it work, screw Trump,trying to dump the name. Just fix it!
@SenBobCorker
The American ppl are just beginning to speak out now because if they did early someone like Donald Trump wldnt hv bin o/ing the W/H now
Amen. .
They won't. 

We have two jobs:

1. DEFEND THE VOTE. Vote STEALING must end.

2. Mend the Russia rift. Progressives + Democrats are ALLIES.
Yes but this is our time, healthcare is a basic human right without health, liberty pursuit of happiness not possible #MEDICARE4ALL
I'm sure there is no oversampling there. Nope, none at all.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAS SPOKEN AND REJECTED YOU LOONIE DEMS AND YOUR FAILED POLICIES! GIVE A BUSINESSMAN A CHANCE TO RUN THIS BUSINESS!
78% also said Hillary would be president. 
You are a fraud!
@KaiserFamFound ACA has caused my health ins cost to almost double, yet the coverage is no better. Why would I want this?
Ok, but that just means Dems will suffer more.
Fix it, pay the subsidies and move on!
That's wonderful. How many people don't have insurance now, because companies keep bailing out. Trump needs to make congress use obamacare
ACA is already dead, nothing to attack
Yeah. Logic and the good ol power of persuasion will certainly work here.
We need to let it implode and devour every single lying liberal in its path.Republicans need to reminde everyone who created this fiasco.
Who are you asking on these polls, non working illegal Medicare recipients? Because anyone that works and pays 4 medical insurance is fed up
Yes, don't kill anything.Make it better and cheaper.The awareness,that 1% of the ppl own 50% of the world,is unhealthy. First agenda subject
#KeepAndImproveObamacare   #Bipartisanship
Breakthrough Sen Harris needs to show nothing but receipts! Come in hard and doing the right thing cause all eyes are on you. No More War.
I agree! I have a adult daughter born with serious heart problem who will need surgery soon. She will be 26 and off our insurance soon.
The American people HAVE spoken. Over 60% of us are DEMANDING #MedicareForAll, but are you listening? No. You're working to save THIS F-off
No wonder they can't afford to treat people.
If only that was enough
Nice source...
Sen. Harris, you know it's failing. Give up lying to the American people.
#SinglePayer #healthcarevote
When the congressmen & Women r forced to have OCare like the American Citizens, then I will quit fighting for complete #Repeal
Not sure what part of the US u live in; but my part of the country hasn't given up. #RepealandReplace !
@HRCremembered @KaiserFamFound   They only care about the 1%ers.
Help us stop Joe Manchin from leaving his dem seat to work for a traitor
The only reason people felt negatively about the ACA is because Republicans told them how terrible it was for 7 years! They lied.
@PersuasivePR @KaiserFamFound they are unpopular & have shown us that they don't know how to govern
@EdDarrell @KaiserFamFound you better talk to Joe Manchin before Monday @SenFranken @ChuckSchumer410
I don't want no damn ACA! I want Obama care! #reverseignorance
Hitlercare was designed to fail by the party elites like you Make people dependant on big government
The American people have spoken. Democrats - give up the attacks on Trump.
Medicare for all!
Shit! We won't need healthcare if we're all dead. So why should we care about it. @GOP wants all the Americans dead one way or another.
Sadly, the question isn't what % of people, it's what % of  support ACA. GOP donors will win big on repealâ€”that's why they won't give up
duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude,..

* taking away #healthcare
* Pushing for #NuclearWar
We see your pattern @realdonaldtrump
NEW: 78% of the public, including 52% of Republicans, want the Trump administration to make the #ACA work http://kaiserf.am/2voEjjZ  
Are these like the election polls? Lol
The American people spoke when we elected @realDonaldTrump .
Anthem announced withdrawal in VIrginia; insurers leaving due to GOP and Trump uncertainty; subsidies may be paid; failure 2 pay is criminal
Get a filibuster proof majority in 2018 n let's get Medicare for ALL.  What say you Madam Senator?
Today Anthem has cancelled ACA policies for 2018 in Virginia because Trump destabilized market.
total bullshit
Sorry. No can do. And it's not affordable. I pay over $800.00 a month. What do you pay?
More important: not even Trump supporters want the law to fail. A majority of THEM want @realDonaldTrump to make ACA work.
What a line of Bull... ask the Americans who are suffering under tremendously burdensome costs:prems and deduct.If one can find an ins. co.
Trump supporters must have a death wish
How about you stop fining people who can no longer afford the ACA first?
Once again defeated.
theyve moved onto more direct keans of exterminating us. make living space for his russian buddies
They also spoke and elected President Trump...give up the attacks on President Trump
If it worked that would be great. But it wasn't  structured to work, so far it's a failure. But that's obvious
Remember GOP who you work for. Should listen to your constituents. 78% is a number you should thinking about.
Pretty sure American people spoke
The American people spoke. Trump is president and Obamacare will go away, by statute or by itself, choose your level of pain

I believe Trump would rather go down in flames than lift a finger to support Obama's legacy.
Yes, make it work. Continue finding that solution to benefit the Ppl in all walks of life!
Get over it Kamala it's over Obamacareless is dead it's over insurance company's have pulled out its to late you failed you lost give it up!
Many of the things that make up Obama care will show up in any Health bill worth a damn. So quit the repeal talk and fix the ACA.
Then have Trump tell cult base that they repealed and replaced and they'll believe it.
Trump must revoke Congress's exemption from Obamacare.
The hemorrhage of DEMs via election since Obamacare doesn't reach you but fakenews polls do....go figure.
They never will. It's not about the public. It's about Obama.
Agreed
Didn't we say that from the beginning ?
This is great, but in the mean time, what are you guys doing stop the NKorea crisis our twitter-in-cheif, man-child president is treatening?
They think lessvof those who disagree. Facts won't change their minds.
I've never seen a group of people trying so hard to shoot their own legs off. GOP: give it up. Enough.
U have tendency to quote a study or poll that was designed to agree with you and the Dems. How phony is that! Can u quote the Kaiser Study?
@KaiserFamFound Nothing says "we are Democrats" better than fighting for a Heritage Foundation chosen healthcare plan..
The American people are telling the GOP to give up. Treasonous Republicans should surrender & face the consequences of their crimes.
Keep it coming, @SenKamalaHarris - we 99%ers appreciate your dedication to saving healthcare for all of us. TY
The problem the GOP is having is because people don't what to lose something once you give it to them. There no valid replacement plan
The closest thing to a DEMOCRACY was stolen from US in1963 & covered up.
VOTE 4 #BernieSanders and we may take it back. Establishment SUCKS.
yep just get the tax payer's check book out like Barry did hell what's few more Trillion right
When will @GOP listen to America and #improveACA . Stop talking about repeal and get something accomplished, admit obama did a good thing!
We haven't even started yet.
The most sad and obvious thing about trump's desire and will to conquer the healthcare bill is he can't stand it that 44 got it to the floor
Apparently @POTUS @realDonaldTrump &  @VP can't read & we know why @VP can't hear. DT's too busy listening to himself talk to hear anything!
The Higgins memo said the Trump base is only loyal as long as Trump is seen to be achieving the vision Trump campaigned on.
@KaiserFamFound the @GOP, & @realDonaldTrump hate facts, especially facts that prove them wrong/
 @TheDemocrats must fight!
It will collapse under its own weight.
In fact, while you're at it (Repubs) just give up your attacks on Obama, Hillary, the Climate, LGBTs etc.
Government can't run business. Repeal this ACA tax!
Polls don't speak for the people. Stop trying to breath life into a dying program. If you think it's not dying it shows how out of touch u r
Only if its rebranded Trumpcare.
A glimmer of hope?
Only if subsidies to individuals and insurance companies are eliminated. Subsidies must stop.
And Democrats come up with something bi-partisan this time that is affordable, provides coverage in all regions, and doesn't bankrupt us.
They added over 100 GOP amendments and begged for GOP input and help.

You said no to everything.
@KaiserFamFound PLEASE stop Trump and GOP of sabotaging ACA @SenKamalaHarris
#ACA     FixItDontNixIt!
#ACA 
#FixItDontNixIt!  PERIOD!!
If its that good then you need to refuse your subsidies that Congress receives. You're such a hypocrite, another fake poll.
Democrats MUST run on Medicare 4All (call it Americare) in 2018/20!
1200 surveyed 
If D.C. cared about what the people thought, the ACA would have never been.
Was never about the American ppl. It was about erasing Obama's legacy.
We love you representing our great state of California in DC. Keep standing up for what's right and don't let the male GOP shut you down.
Trump doesn't care about the people.. he cares about himself. that's it and that's all
And N.KOREA,
The American people have spoken... so precious how childrens' brains function.
No more funding to this unconstitutional bullshit! Obama & the @DNC are plagues to the USA. The @DNC is broke, think about THAT!
We're just getting warmed up!
@KaiserFamFound
Plan?
Amen! Thank you for standing up for us! 2020 run???
D RepBoobs misrepresented-mislabeled-misled-poisoned America sinceNewt Gingrich "divide&conquer" keep ppl ignorant&voting against themselves
#SinglePayer. We need health care, not health insurance.

Agreed. Wish @POTUS would give it up .... but his desire to 'Win at ANY cost' overrides everything else @foxandfriends @FoxNews @WhiteHouse
When ppl were asked ACA was GOOD they liked it D same ppl said they wanted 2 repeal & replace "OBAMA CARE" RepBoob malicious labeling worked
Can we at least rename it? "Affordable" right in the title is obviously and blatantly dishonest.
"Insurer Care Act"
"Wealth Maintenance Act"
The Tangerine Tyrant will dismiss it as Fake News, unless it's on FOX.
Hell yea! 
And fortunately the Senate represented the people when it declined to repeal the ACA! Thank you for your advocacy and women for those calls!
Bernie said he was going to repeal and replace the ACA, just like the republicans. No body reacted b/c Bernie is just a big mouth.
You are fake poles that gave Hillary a win by a landslide do not impress us honey!
If you want ACA to "work" Dem's have to get involved again. Swallow yer pride and get stuck in!
Anything that comes from a POC can never be as good as what comes from old white men.  The @HouseGOP will never work to fix the #ACA
Well Kamala maybe you need to talk to Rep Jim Johnson imtroducing new abolish obama affordable care bill this week
If you think it's a good law then you're part of Americans problem.
#SinglePayer is a way for everyone.
YES your tweet (notification) TRUTHFULLY, Sen Kamala Harris;  (Family) TOGETHER;  Watching @FOX NEWS # OUTNUMBERES NOW!  Tweet Always,I do.
Shut up
Thanks for representing your constituents. My senators @tedcruz  @JohnCornyn ignore those of us who oppose the GOP mandates. Party-firsters.
You're delusional, & next year, gone!! No more voter fraud in California, and killarys popular vote just got deported, Gluck, you'll need it
@realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan fix ACA stop destroying
Sorry that's a No vote from me on Harris.
Mark Zuckerberg
@KaiserFamFound the American people believe in polls about the same as they do in santa clause
I like you Senator. You are an intelligent, well-spoken woman. Who has had enough of the BS.
The people of California have spoken. Ms Harris - give up the attacks on #SinglePayer .
Got that @realDonaldTrump? It's over.

Healthcare Justice is #JusticeForAll (Unifying message for Democrats!)
A poll from a major healthcare provider Kami? No bias here. Scrap the ACA get together with the Rep's and create HC for the people not insur
Ah, no. Who died and made u boss. Get over yourself
NOD real poll that only matter was on 11/8 & it was loud & clear thatwanted REPEALNext real poll- 11/6/18. Let's go MO ND IN PA WI MI
Kamala, don't you think Kaiser wants to keep ACA for the BIG subsidies they get? Use your brains.
#TheUnitedStatesOfShamerica
Yes, Americans have spoken, @GOP. Heed the warnings.

Come 2018, you will see Americans take action. @DNC #YourLastTerm #YVYL
You mean Unaffordable Care Act. Iâ€™m not a rightist but when will Dems admit the ACA is no longer affordable and is a problem? $2k deductible
Thank you for everything you do, Senator Harris. Was wonderful to meet with your staff in DC yesterday. Would love to thank you one day. 
What about attacks on blacks and others of color? Women? America? These things matter also. If it weren't for racism Trump wouldn't be POTUS
Unfortnately it is not the will of american people that counts.  They have big donors 2 please.
Maybe healthcare choice is a matter of principle for some.
Dt just wants a win. #ImpeachNow
We need to run on this issue- fix the healthcare system. ACA works in places where they wanted it to work. That needs to be everywhere!
Hopefully, GOP will realize that healthcare is a human right for all! Thank u for fighting for this right in behalf of the American people!
Who knew it was so difficult? Certainly not the orange ape!
Why don't the Republicans work together with DEMs to fix ACA for the American People? Don't we the ppl count at all? #StopPartisanBigotry
Really You wanna know why? None of the insurers that left will come back & they are suing the ACA. MSM won't tell ya that & that info is OLD
And democrats like her KNOW that
Still....they need to work together to fix it--I don't care what name you give it. DEMS nor REPUBS are paying my bills. I want "Affordable"
Fix the the areas of ACA that need work, U.S. is not ready for Single Payer (great idea not yet ready for primetime).
The GOP in now just an extension of a Super PAC. People aren't really there concern.
What your solution? Your already a dupe to the insurance companies.
And now it's time to move to #SinglePayer #MedicareForAll
@KaiserFamFound how many want Trump gone....
Republicans don't give up... which is why they've kicked democrats out of over 1000 seats across gov over the last 8 years. Learn something.
Americans have spoken and elected @realDonaldTrump to repeal and replace that failure
How's that working out for You? Your own party cant agree on anything. #winning
#Harris4Prez2020
