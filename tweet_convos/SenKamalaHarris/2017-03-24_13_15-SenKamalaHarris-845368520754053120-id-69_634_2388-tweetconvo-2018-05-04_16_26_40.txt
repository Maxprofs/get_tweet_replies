This sends a clear message to President Trump and Republicans.
We will not cut the deficit by cutting care. We will not give tax breaks to insurers while giving higher medical bills to patients.
We will not tell seniors, cancer patients, and women, "you’re on your own." #KillTheBill
Entitlements are not in the Bill of Rights. However, rest assured @potus will not let those people down perhaps limited to
Health Care is NOT a right. It should not be a ill run government entitlement.
wait, don’t you mean the other way around? Health care is a right — not a privilege!
?
my mistake -- i misread what @SenKamalaHarris was saying.
thought so lol.  Nice attempt though... 
no attempt at anything, other than i thought in the heat of the moment she misspoke, that's all. 
you misunderstood me.  I meant nice attempt at reading.
lol -- oh, ok, guilty as charged. 
The only ones that stood up was the democrats in office! oh and Maybe the PAID Rioters, vandals, and thugs.
And more than 24 million STILL without any healthcare.  Nobody seems to care about them.
Democrats are destroying America
gop conservatives rejected it. Dont flatter yourselves
What lies are you going to tell when Obummer care implodes ? Only those getting it FREE want it & rest of us pay 2 much
There's a big diff b/w basic health care & health insurance. No 1 turned away from hospital ERs b4 OCare & won't b after.
You are starting to make Maxine Water appear to be sane.
because it isn't a right. Sheesh and you're a lawyer? Smh.
@kkalmes2 Except health bill didn't pass because it didn't cut enough health benefits to get Freedom/Tea Party votes.
you took an oath to uphold the Constitution & it does NOT promise health care but a chance to good life, uphold your oath
And you're implying that all Americans should be under obligation to pay expensive Obamacare premiums?
Grow up, #moonbat!
You need to refresh your concept of what a right is.
Respectfully, you're wrong. It's a testament to the millions of Americans who don't think healthcare is a fed gov issue
This was a rejection of the individual mandate,nothing more.#FullRepeal
@AjayCnyc ACA needs some work but it needs some work not repeal and replaced
you are awesome!!!!!
A "right"? SHOW US THE PROOF. It's dweebs such as yourself that embarrass those if us with intellect. 
#buffoon
@ShebaRiddle5 yes but don't forget about the $$ crocs...
WRONG it's a testament to those GOP members who stood on a promise to repeal and replace not more government handouts
You are relentlessly dense. Millions of CONSERVATIVES opposed this renaming of TERRIBLE Obamacare. #FullRepeal is next.
@lovealaska1105 U literally said you won't support SCOTUS nominee b/c he cares abt laws. Sorry, ur opinion doesn't matter.
The numbers are quite impressive, @SenKamalaHarris.
Politicians love to offer "free" stuff and label the labor of others a "right" when it's not their money they're using.
Rofl You won nothing
ACHA failed because it had too much ACA left on it 
You liberal's unicorn fantasies are hilarious
@truthseeker526 And its a testament 2our Reps who went 2 work for all us very United in their stand on health care as right
The only way to treat healthcare as a right is to have Universal Healthcare like every other major nation
what section is it in the constitution? Which federalist paper? @SenKamalaHarris do illegals have a right to come here too?
@Shoq Would like to also stand up & reject that Trump is viable POTUS. #TrumpRussia We need independent investigation cmte!
Not a right
Delusional. Obamacare is collapsing and the problem with Ryancare was its similarity. Real reform now possible.
Please take steps to fix ACA. @RepAdamSchiff @SenFeinstein Don't let Reps strip it dry or ignore repair. We all own it now.
so can we start talking about #SinglePayer now?
THANK you!! And in case the rest of our message didn't come through clear - we really want and deserve universal healthcare! Thnx in advance
1 of 2 No where in the Constitution does it guarantees free medical, therefore it is not a right.  Somebody has to pay.
Good work!  Now the hard part starts: fixing the ACA. Costs are going up and it's non sustainable in the long run. #goforit
tell the fake pres to stop pointing fingers and get to work
You have made California proud. So happy you are in DC working had for all Americans!  We Love you!
They should work with Dems to improve ACA rather than sabotage ACA! Thank you for the hard work 
if a right, then why do I have to pay so much for less? Can't choose doctors anymore.
you are a rising star I hope you will go much further! You are the kind your country needs!
get ins cos to join the underserved exchanges & improve level of payment to Drs so more will take OCare patients.  FIX IT!
#SinglePayer #MedicareForAll ???
TY Senator #ResistTrumpCare
Who knew healthcare could be so hard?
and strong leaders like you!
@RTMannJr trade: they give us Garland, we give them an ACA fix that can pass
What a great day to be #TheResistance.. #TrumpcareFails!
This is what democracy looks like!! #SaveACA
Thank you Senator! We stand with you.
victory for humanity!
thank you!
IS THAT YOU BERNIE!?!?!
just giving you a hard time. And tbh i love it when you talk like Bernie. Keep it up! #TalkBernieToMe #YesWeKamala
Thank you Kamala!!
Could you please cite where in the constitution health care is a right?
A reminder, that in the end, the People have the power.
If the "People" have the power, why do leftist progressives keep asking for more gvmnt instead? Gvmnt is the problem, not the solution
The reason the bill lost was because it didn't repeal Obamacare- which is why most of them are in Congress.
