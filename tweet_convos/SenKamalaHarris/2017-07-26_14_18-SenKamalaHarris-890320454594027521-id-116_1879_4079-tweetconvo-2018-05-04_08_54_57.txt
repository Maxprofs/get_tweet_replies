True
Thank you for fighting for the good of the people. I very much appreciate what you're doing.
Lucky to have you as one of my Senators. Thank you for all you do & keep fighting the good fight. Much respect!
Durbin and Duckworth are standing strong. I tweeted McCain as a vet and told him that I was ashamed of him

@BillCassidy no one answers the phone. @SenJohnKennedy aides get irritated when u ask why ACA good for the senator but not for me #hypocrisy
You are my senator 
Absolutely keep fighting!
Burr is my senator and he not good for NC I called but he won't listen
You are my Senator,  I want you to vote yes on  Daine's amendment.aka HR676
My Senator is @marcorubio My opinions fall on deaf ears. Senator Bill Nelson is on board, but Marco only follows the lead of @POTUS Sad.
Yes, call all senators and vote to repeal Obama care.
We are, they quit answering the damn phones, it's what this country has come to.. embarrassment
My senator @SenCoryGardner doesnt give a shit. He doesn't meet with voters, his office phones are always busy or not answered. #copolitics
#SaveOurHealthcare #SaveACA 
(202)225-3121 or (202)224-3121
Since you're mine, can you just say I called and save us some time?
Lucky you, you have one of the good senators.  #texasIsHell
THANK YOU for staying so dialed in to the public here & for leading with such grace! I can't wait for #kamalaharris2020 
She would be a WONDERFUL president! And who better to take Trump down?!?
Will do that this morning!  Thanks!
I have Warren and Markey and feel useless - they have souls.  I even voted for Romney, who was the architect of Ted Kennedy's goal.
As my senator I appeal to you ---- repeal Obamacare. It hurt way more people than it helped. Repeal it and start over. ACA was rushed.
From MN - not worried about our senators.  Who else should be called? Will other reps and senators listen to non-residents?
Called both from NC today. Used to get a live person in ofc of @SenThomTillis. Now he's resorting to vm only like @SenatorBurr. LEFT MSGS!
@senrobportman is my senator and his Columbus office hasn't answered the phone once in 2 days.
I called you...but you, Senator, you hung up on me.  All ready committed to the Dem rhetoric?  yep, I think so.  You don't have my vote
What should one do when you and Dianne are my senators? (Very thankful for that btw.)
You’re my Senator. Thanks for keeping up the fight!
I have been calling! And will continue ro do thia
I am lucky that I have two democratic senators (NJ) and my rep is also democratic (Bonnie Watson Coleman).
Offices are closed. They don't want people who work days a chance to tell @SenJohnHoeven  to vote no. but, it's fruitless,in NDa red state.
Hello USA, here is something to think about regarding healthcare : http://youtu.be/-hu7abzTMnc  , short vid, bit old, but still valid.
I wish my senators listened! Their lips are so firmly glued to 45's backside, their ears stopped working. @sendavidperdue @SenatorIsakson
Thank you kamala. Top pick for next election with @perlmutations as your running mate.
Called Sen.Toomey-pretty sure I'm wasting time. He was barely elected w/ the help of the Rparty & is not up for reelection.Thanks KH for all
You're (one of) my senators, @SenKamalaHarris!  Would you like me to call you? :-)
My Senators are @JeffFlake & @SenJohnMcCain who do not vote according to what's best for their constituents.
You HAVE to locate and promote a suitable candidate to run against Trump now. The "Delay and Demean" tract is a loser.
Yes! I'm a transwoman. Don't allow tRump to use us in a petty, desperate attempt to distract and divide!! Please dont lose focus!! #SaveACA
Just spoke with your staff - they're a great team.  A big thank you to everyone answering phones. #SaveACA
@SenCoryGardner doesn't listen to his constituents. He listens to the party. Will unseat him. #OneTermSenator
They aren't listening ..
mine are Mark Warner and Tim Kaine. I don't need to call them. Is there something else I can be doing?
Senator Harris, I am one of our constituents. I am currently out of the county. Please keep doing everything you can to stop this bill.
We will.
But… YOU are my senator! Lucky me! Keep up the hard work Senator Harris! You rock!
I'm fortunate I live in California.
My senators are @JohnCornyn  and @tedcruz They don't care about my feelings on healthcare

My senators are voting against it because they're intelligent women &they work for the people not for the party thank you
I won't I made it my daily duty calling my shitty senators and rep. I am from Texas district 6,that's it my country come first
YOU are my Senator! Thank you!
I support your no vote. Keep fighting.
Thank you Kamala! I call everyday single day! I live in #Sarasota County, Florida. You light up my world and give me strength! #Republicans
Between you and @SenFeinstein I Know that I'm covered. Thank you both for all of your Hard Work!
#kamala2020 #ACA #MAGA #ScumbagDonald
Please go away. We don't need Clinton 2.0.
You guys are the ones hugging McCain as he votes to start to kill Obamacare.
Doesn't do any good.
This is partisan. Very few @gop care what this is doing 2 people.The anxiety it's causing.  My hat is off 2 Dems and 2 Collins and Murkowski
Kamala, please vote #FullRepeal  I am your constituent. Socialism NEVER works.
Proud to say you're my senator!
None of this would be happening if the rich did not need a tax break.
Thankfully, YOU are my senator. Does it help to call other state's senators? I heard not.
Thanks for all your work!
@teter45013 #ScumbagDonald

How's that affair going with what's that assholes name oh right Rand Paul
Called Brian Babin, in Woodville, TEXAS & went to his Town Hall. It was like being in the belly of an evil beast! MUSLIMS ARE IN OUR SCHOOLS
Marco Rubio is my senator ,but he think he is and emperor,he forgot that is father was a bartender and his mother factory worker.
Also everybody should know that his brother in law did time on prison drug trafficking
Rubio, living in his house at the time He didn'tkow

Repeal Obamacare! Defund Planned Parenthood!! Pay for your own abortion if you want to kill your baby!!
They already do please read the Hyde amendment

#FullRepeal

Hard to get myself going to call Cornyn
It's pointless for us here in Texas... Cornyn and Cruz.  They don't listen to us... ever.
1) And when this fight is done, then what? Is there a plan? Here's one.
http://www.medicareforall.org/pages/HR676_and_S915 …
2) We should stop rationing care by economic, or social position. We should have the same healthcare we provide for you.
#MedicareForAll Now
Does it make sense for me to call my senator multiple times today? Does it makes sense to call other the senators from other states?
In the UK our politicians would be slaughtered for trying to destroy the NHS (free health care) - keep fighting for your rights USA
Do you keep count of calls and letters? Do you publish on your webpage?
By the way, all of these calls are being routed to an outsourced call center in India.

Yeah we get it. The world is about to explode and every minute in human history is the most important... Got it...
It's the Koch Bros-supported Tea-Party groups that are doing this. The rest of the morally-bankrupt GOP are just whores in fancy suits!
They don't care about us.
Will you run for President?.........PLEASE????
Suggestions other then vote, if from KY

nobamacare SUCKS!

A total of 13 GOP senators--including 10 men--have voted no on one or both of these bills, but only the female senators are being attacked. https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/890290865956114432 …
You are one of mine so I know I don't need to call!  Keep on fighting!!
