I'll keep you in the loop with my assistance in their rebuild and recovery!! Especially, the US Virgin Islands
Awesome,...I just return from Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands checking on my familia,....
Here Here!!! Thank you Senator for highlighting this.
Its my belief that diversity is the best way to have thinking outside the box.
that is intellectual diversity, not racial/cultural diversity right?
Wrong!  Racial/cultural/sexual diversity is exactly what I meant.
diversity of culture doesn't always work out. intellectual diversity is much more important.
Exactly what is your idea of intellectual diversity?
where ideas are expressed freely and peacefully *rep, dem, nat. socialism, communism, supremacy, nationalism, etc*
He forgets 1/2 of the USA used to BE Mexico.
I'm a German-American; do I get recognition?

Thank you madam president diversity is strength & we are a diverse nation a melting pot of humanity too often that is forgotten we are w you
go to europe and tell me cultural diversity is strength
Better yet you can pack your bags & join the bigots that voted for Brexit no one had a choice over whites infesting other culture so you 1st
face it: whites and asians have been the greatest contributor to the wonderful world we live in today.
No whites have slaughtered and disrespected every race on the planet and what you fear is the result of people waking up & recognize you for
so i make a comment that is showing a positive about whites and you assume im a white guy
Better and there are lots of dead people who would have lived if not for white culture being shared & if you voted for him yes u r an idiot
you can't even make an argument without using insults. calling someone an idiot is not an argument
I'm stunned it's still allowed to exist. Kinda nervous about February.

Nancy & Chuck have been lawmakers 30/18 yrs. U have been in ofc 7 mo! Be creative/POTUS will help U. America voted in OUR AGENDA/PASS AGENDA
Only if it fits YOUR definition of diversity, right? Or what YOU think is worthy of celebration. That's the way it works, right??
No

Kamala, how many Hispanics embrace diversity? How diverse is our immigration policy when a disproportionately high number are from Mexico?
#FrankenHarris2020 humanity, strength and sanity.
Yes! #DiversityIsStrength #SpanishHeritageMonth
Also has this always been a thing that I didn't know about?
Am I the only one who thinks that pinning someone's history to just a month is kind of weird?
And you want to oppress every non Christian!
Yeah
LET'S CELEBRATE SENDING PEOPLE BACK TO MEXICO!
Follow the law

Refuse to fully assimilate. Obey all laws but stay as you are!  

#DiversityIsBeautiful 
#HispanicHeritageMonth
then why the fuck are you even in the us to begin with?
LA MIGRA .....run
Just out of curiosity: Would you be ok with White Heritage Month?
oh no by whatever form of logic that's racist because some white ppl owned slaves before any of us were born
I'm with you ! Let's go forward not backward!
Everyday is a celebration of white heritage, and it's been that way for centuries.
I never even called you a racist...but interesting you choose to not be civil as a response in this feed.
By separating by race and ethnicity
working  under the table. If they become citizens, they will all get laid off and replace by more. 

Get rid of mininum wage you fool.
Happy #HispanicHeritageMonth!  Will not vote for you bc you didn't prosecute a single banker when you had evidence. YOU ARE NOT PROGRESSIVE.
Yes run!
YOU WILL LOSE!

Here's collection of brilliant Latinnovators (50% in #California!) in book/eBook to inspire students! #Latinnovating #HispanicHeritageMonth
I see your fishing for votes early...
Like being a massive drain on our resources, or worshipping death gods? Great heritage.
@KamalaHarris2020!

Can't see why immigration reform can't be 
Based on a system of merit like DACA
@NancyPelosi…
#DACADeal is a step in the right direction
i didn't know the right direction was allowing people to break the law with no consequence
That the point of merit
You don't have merit you have nothing
ok what are you even talking about
Read DACA if you work hard get a job join the military stay out of trouble 
You have a path
daca is an organization dedicated to protecting ppl here illegally
Yes, we love hispanics and their heritage.  But, we only want legal immigrants to live here.
We will never have equality as long as this keeps up..
Yes!!  Embrace Diversity! Did the Donald give a shout out to Hispanic Heritage Month?? I must have missed it.....
Why should he blow smoke up their ass (likeobamadid),he tryna get rid of those illegal piece of shits
There destroying America just like there countries!
..... man, you're on another level of ignorant
Yes ma'am. 
Yes let's embrace it ... but make it fair ... somehow proportional ... because in Congressional and Senate Committees Chairs and SCOTUS ...
E Pluribus Unum.....You'll never understand....poor dear.

The best thing we could possibly do to celebrate #HispanicHeritageMonth is to...

#ImpeachTrumpNow
You should change your nickname to Fake American
you should not support a bigot and then call america "a great country"
Trump won't be celebrating.
