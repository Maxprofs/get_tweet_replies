No way should this get through people will not forget those that threw us under the bus!!!
Maybe if ya'll worked a full 8 hrs. it wouldn't take so long. When in session you should have to be a desk the whole time. Things would get
@ActDontReact Still hanging on.
I don't have medication for the anxiety or depression it is causing me. No lie. I've written, called, etc. This will kill us.
I know, my blood pressure is up. I got angry talking w Sen. Boozman and Sen Cotton DC staff today. Not how I want to live my life. #hell

Sen Harris please make some noise with this nonsense. We are counting on you
We are watching you on C-Span2 in CA. With you all the way!!!
Thank you for everything you are doing!
Hang in there Senator! We stand behind you every step of the way!
Watching on c-span. Thanks for voting for Senator Murray's motion to send the bill to committee. The right way.
Stay strong and smart, we are depending on your best work to keep destructive ill-conceived bills from becoming law!
There are Compromises to be made. How well would it serve a Senator to serve ALL of their constituents?
Serve an entire group of people. Republicans and Democrats!!!
Do me a favor Miss Kamala. If u get a chance, remind your colleagues that none of them won with 100% of the vote. Remind them that they.....
Thank you for fighting for the people and for standing up against the Republicans skinny repeal.
It's a late night every night for many who work two jobs to make ends meet.
out here in Californiawatching! Counting n you, thank you!
Call bullshit on this whole illegitimate government.
WE ARE WITH YOU SENATOR! 
You are actually going to do some work?  #Surprise
It's shortly after midnight. You're about to vote. We have been with you every minute. Thanks for fighting for us.
Fight it!!!
We are awake and with you.
Thanks Kamala. Whatever the outcome of Senate health care vote is, we know you fought and care.
Update: 16 million ppl (including me) are about to be kicked off of our insurance plans. Goodnight.
@SenKamalaHarris  senators (most) are NOT medical providers nor educated in the field. Get clinicians involved in this. Ppl who DO this!
We're with you!!!! Thank you for fighting with us!!!!
I'm very worried!
Stand strong and shame those bastards into doing the right thing.
I'm so disgusted by the GOP my stomach hurts. Thanks for your efforts. We will not forget those who fought for us
Thank YOU, Senator, for your commitment, courage, and conviction!
Any word? I'm really scared here...
On a side topic circulate re marijuana laws
We are here with you!
What about the $788 BILLION border wall bill the house just passed? These MEpublicans have lost their minds!
We're watching C-Span right now. Enzi is pretty boring. Staying with you!
Stay faithful.... and keep chanting.....

Itâ€™s time to pan
the kick the can
health care plan

Thank you Senator
#midnightmassacre
Thank you for your diligence for #America!
Senator, go get some rest. Your input and vote is inconsequential. The GOP is in charge of this vote.51 and Obamacare is done.
It would be so much simpler to fix the #ACA, but that was the black guy's program & we just can't allow that to stay. Sorry America!
fight hard, try to amend..stay strong we are with you..#resist..
Hang in there, Senator.  I wish someone could knock some sense into your colleagues.  Thank you for your service.
Stay strong!
We're with you, Senator Harris.
Ryan's word is absolutely worthless. I think Senate GOP knows this.
Stay strong
This is sad McConnell Dr of death doesn't give a dam about anyone but his  benefactors filling his pockets this is a black eyes on the USA.
Please speak reason and truth. These GOP senators need to stop. People will die!
As a healthcare worker in CA I implore you to actually speak 2 physicians N the healthcare industry. U will learn that O-care is a disaster
We are with you!
Thank you for representing the people
Thank-you, hang in there! We're with you!
Defund Planned Parenthood!



You might as well,go to bed.  Not going to change anything now.
Would you tell Blunt to set down and shut up. He's destroyed  Missouri . Thanks for all you are doing.
With you all the way!!
Thank you! Fight the good fight!
I have worn my fingers out on @botresist Sent so many messages I'm an elite member. Twice today. Might be time again. #Resist

The extent to which GOP debases itself for Trump underscores their complete worthlessness and must cement our resolve to end their reign.
the moderates always cave
Keep fighting, Senator!
@SenateGOP and @HouseGOP are passing the same flaming bag of excrement back and forth, each hoping the other will be the 1st to stomp on it.
Thank you for fighting!
Please keep fighting for us. I'm not too proud to beg.
Thanks in advance for your NO vote. I am so proud that you're my Senator!
I.  Love.   You.
Someone will have to do a pancake or omelette run!!
We're here!
Stop calling it healthcare.  You should have called it Deathcare from jump. Wake up
I for 1 will be actively working against  reelection for Rethuglican candidated who r supporting this travesty clown show
I have faith in you
Thank you for all you are doing,
Keep at it lady
I am afraid.   All they care about is screwing Pres Obama legacy.  The @SenateGOP do not care about their constituents
We're with you, @SenKamalaHarris
Thank you!
WHAT IS GOING ON AND WHY IS THIS INSANITY HAPPENING IN OUR COUTRY?!?
So much anxiety right now for my family! I'm disabled and my healthcare will hurt us if taken away
I'm a pre-existing condition and we are a military family ...why are you doing this to us??
Hopefully this GOP clown operation will trip all over themselves and make bill go away.please find allies to create fixes to ACA.
The cost increases in this bill could trigger a recession then what will congress do Absurd!
 Thanks for staying up!!!
Thanks!!!!!
You got it. I'll be up.
Can't you all deny consent and block this disaster?
Thank you for all you do.
Heavenly Father please wrap our leaders in your Loving Grace, give them the strength to stand up and do
 #TheRightThing for our Country
consider that this insanity is below what California should be and we should become a free and independent people!
I'm staying with you all the way! My husband and I watched UR. debate here in Cali and voted for you! We're in SBNF, Crestline, CA.  You!
Hang in there, Senator.
Its appreciated Ms Harris! 
Barely breathing.
Please. For the Love of God. Go to the floor and go the Hell off. No more Mrs nice Kamala. We got your back. Lay the smack down.

Maybe you should take a look at this, as to why nothing will change my Friend

@PrincessBravato Thank You for all you're doing 4 us Sen.!!
Why are you actually working or just grandstanding
Thank you @KamalaHarris , We love you and how hard you are working for us! (And I'm in FL)
Anyone who votes yes should assume it becomes law. We hold that standard & they must too. didn't elect Ryan to the senate.
Why not?  I think I've had @cspan on since 11AM.  As a 59 yo self employed breast cancer, it's D day.
I am so sick of the @GOP and the pig of a POTUS
Thank you for your service and for fighting for us!!!
#wethepeople qill watch take names and vite you

Up there with you Senator.
Thank you Senator. I appreciate your hard work
hang in there Sen. Harris! We need you!
Why don't you update on how all Dems voted even against the single payer option tonight what happen isn't that what you Dems wanted
I just called again. Paul Ryan didn't give Lindsey Graham what he wanted regarding to Skinny Bill. Vote no
Here!
We're with you Kamala. If this passes, things are going to get really bad on many levels.
Hang tough. It HAS to be more exhausting for you being on the front lines than for the rest of us, and it's pretty bad out here. Thank you!
I feel your pain.  This is like the mad tea party in Alice in Wonderland.  Leader M is the dormouse!!
Kick some a$$...thank you to everyone that truly is standing up for us all #Resist
Stay strong kamala!
Really proud of you Senator! Texas Senators are the ones with tin foil on their heads so I appreciate your help!!!
Watching on cspan. Good luck, and ty for working so hard for us regular folks who need the help.
They think we aren't watching at night.  We are.  Go get 'em Kamala!
Thank you Senator and future President
Couldn't keep us away
Pretty much a given you will oppose this... Why the fanfare? And when you gonna endorse #MedicareForAll @JordanChariton
Try thinking. The logical answer is as soon as it would benefit her politically to endorse that position.
Funny because by all political weather maps that time is NOW
Stay strong Senator and drink lots of coffee! 
We stand strong with Kamala. I am thsnkful I live in California where dems are loud proud and in charge.

No TrumpCare
Think Single Payer!
@ToddYoungIN doesn't even want to talk to us. It just goes to a machine.
Thank you for keeping the public informed when the GOP want to slink about in the shadows.
