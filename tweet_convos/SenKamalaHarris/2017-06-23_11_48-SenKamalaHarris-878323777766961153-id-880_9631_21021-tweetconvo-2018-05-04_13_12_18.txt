Cannot fathom how any middle class trumper is buying this as good for them.
They only watch Faux, so the bill is pushed as a good thing there...or not covered at all. I wouldn't know as I never watch.
Try watching Faux for a bit... It is downright scary to see how they report on the "news".  People that watch Faux only have no idea...
I just can't imagine not checking lots of news sources. Looking everywhere.
Yes, I have relatives in AL that watch only @FoxNews. They will argue about news because they haven't seen the story. Major stories too!
Fox news still has them seething over Hillary/Obama other conspiracy theories. @FoxNews stuck in a newsroom time warp that never progresses
Faux is the propaganda arm of our Great Leader's party. It pumps up their ignorant audience with news that anyone rational knows is Not News
Victim lol fox rewards the criminal & crucifixes the innocent I ever c a fox news covering a story & I c them on street? Run just run pg3
It's a HATE CRIME is what it is. Against the elderly, disabled, infirm, children, vets and the middle class.
I see your point. Why do we hate people in need in this country? Are we really that heartless and selfish?
We're not. It's mostly the ignorant & lazy lashing out blindly from their caves. Love is free but turns to hate & resentment if not nurtured
Let's call masses of Dem legislators running from #MedicareForAll what it is
Bribed To Treason
@akaXochi @SenKamalaHarris Best clean up ur act as well Dems.No hypocrisy allowed!Leave that 2 Evangelicals + the GOP! #EXPERTS!
Why didn't YOU speak up for single payer in California that was VOTED DOWN BY A DEMOCRAT last week? Hypocrite.
What makes this scenarion sick is that it can be done with a vote. The country should vote on issues like this. Think like Gosuch!
I agree
OR

SINGLE PRAYER.
LOL! Good one!
"Trump Tax Break Care"
Single payer now, coward
It is actually the Republican Genocide Bill
Until you get on the right side of history & support #SinglePayer #Medicare4All that #PrezObama  initially campaigned 4, don't get too cozy.
#Embalmcare is good.
and asking the poor to die peacefully
and CHEAPLY
Most of them don't vote. They did when their unions existed and their towns had economies, but now only richer Rs vote in these districts.
The rich vote R more or less everywhere, the poor vote D, people below a certain poverty level don't vote at all. And so poor states go R.
Your performance at the recent hearings was disgraceful.  You had no interest in finding answers.  Your goal was to trip up Jeff Sessions.
You failed, were reprimanded, & showed yourself to be unjust & unprincipled. Go take on a personal injury case.  It's more your speed. #MAGA
And was what for whom I have little, the loss of my Doctor has been devastating
Let's call the ACA what it is: the "Insurance Company Handout Act." Medicare for all.
#WealthCareBill
We know where you stand... Waist deep in !
Do you support single payer? How much money have you taken from insurance and pharma?
TCMA
Let's call Dems running from Medicare For all what it is: Fraud. Kamala tell us how you got where you are
Last time you guys complained about tax cuts for the rich, receipts in increased by 200 billion while my middle class check increased also
Absolutely
How about naming it the Republican Insurance Program, R.I.P. for short?
Show us these cuts. For only rich. Name them.
Yes, exactly. A stinker by any other name but tax cuts for the rich is an insult to the American people & stinks to high  heaven!
Harris you're full of CRAP! Dem play book thru & thru!
Enjoying your healthcare yet? Full of Crap? Dem play book?   Yeah........right....Enjoy.
A bunch of folks are calling it "Wealth Care."
If by "a bunch of folks" you mean "@jonfavs and sometimes begrudgingly @jonlovett" then yes.
Me too.
Sorry but instead of tweeting about it, please DO something about it.
Turns out, we didn't elect enough local representatives so that our voices are heard. We're powerless to defend ourselves against the GOP.
Let's talk about hope for the future. Unify the Democratic party. Consolidation of our voices on the left is our only hope to defeat fascism
Sylvia I am going 2 do something about it I'm going 2 vote in 2018 I always vote my dear not tweet all day things take time
If Trump would actually READ the bills he wants passed..Do you think  it would  make a difference ..?

Naw...
Nope
Linda u see Trump's face? He has the face of hatred I thought I had a mean face in the morning he got it all day
Hes getting uglier and uglier
Thanks, @SenKamalaHarris 

definitely #wealthcare 
aka #wealthcarebill
Ah the INCOME CARD from just one more RICH DEMOCRAT SENATOR, you people lie so much it comes naturally.
There's got to be something that can stop this...calling congressmen is a given
Making noise without knowing the facts. Lazy and unprofessional but so typical.
Let's call this comment for what it is: stupid and inaccurate
Wealth Care!
Why aren't we basing our healthcare system on the French system, arguably one of the best there is? It would save money for all
I agree!
You mean "wealth care"
Would be FUNNY, if it wasn't...  ...TRUE!
Yes !!!
My preference: Death Care for the average Joe & Jill, Wealth care for millionaires & billionaires. But it's too long for a tweet!

Then publicly start calling it that! Get entire @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats to use the label going forward!! Repetition is how ppl learn.
Kamala, you would make a great President. We need fire and compassion in a leader.
Let's call @SenKamalaHarris performance record wht it is/was.Worst prosecution record in Ca. history and Crony/job failures across the board
We need to rebrand the GOP for who they are.
Or #DeathEnsurance
Sen Harris...will you please start speaking abt the impacts this will have on employer based Health Insurance??
Close, call it the "Trump/McConnell Tax Cuts for Millionaires Act."
You're going to #LOSE again but look at the bright side when #Democrat lose #AMERICA #WINS #MAGA
New Mexico's economy is going to lose big-time on this one brother. Maybe more than any other state. #worstbillever
Have you or anyone looked at the abuse of programs by those not needing it and #ILLEGAL aliens?
Fix those two items and those really in need are covered!
Let's call it #AmericanDeathcareAct , what thousands of doctors on the front lines call it @physicianwomen
Do you guys have anyone word smithing better slogans and talking points. You should
"Health care" - GOP #TaxCutsForFatCatsAct #USpoli
Calling it stuff won't help something must be done
It first needs to be indentified and I'm just using the old drunk from Alaska's terminology
DT says it is much better Covers more people and is much cheaper

Truth hurts
Naw....Death Panels
I call it the Killing Disabled, Sick, and Poor People Act. #TrumpCareKills #GOPKills
#RIP

Republican insurance plan
Republican Insurance Plan (R.I.P.) !!
Or the end of American decency or the death of the American ideal
@DeathCare
@universe2519 #taxcare
Let's call ACA what it is... Forcing us to do business with insurers & pharma at top dollar. 
*billionaires*
I like Welfare for the Wealthy Act!
#wealthcarebill
Wouldn't deathcare be more appropriate at this point?
Its like calling repeal of the assault weapon ban a gun control bill. It just makes no sense.
Please help us, @KamalaHarris
Wealthcare! @jonlovett @jonfavs @podsaveamerica
You mean the reduction of the tax increase that the last President implemented??  Net effect ZERO .....
Have any of you actually read the document or just listen to MSNBC or CSN???  Hmmmm...
Do something about it
It's the "tax reform" they've been working on. 
#WealthCare
#wealthcarebill
WealthCare #friendofthepod
#wealthcare
They have taken everything from me I don't have anything left I'm poor and down and out yes I'm a victim to their democracy
TRUMPCARE. TRUMPCARE. TRUMPCARE. TRUMPCARE. TRUMPCARE. TRUMPCARE. TRUMPCARE. TRUMPCARE. TRUMPCARE. TRUMPCARE. TRUMPCARE. TRUMPCARE.
Senator Harris, I would need to know about what policies you support BUT I am thinking I would work my tail off for you, if you ran for Pres
No no. It's the "Blood Sacrifice for Millionaires Act."
I've heard it called  wealthcare
@GovHowardDean but that name leaves out the harsh health impacts. More than just about $$$,  IMHO.
You need to announce your intention to run for president.  We need a positive message and messenger!!!!!

Or Tump Care.  Prefer the latter.
U don't say ! I give up I'm wealthy and spend so much energy trying to help others understand why trump n this is awful. I've lost
@VP calls it "personal responsibility" 
Why does Republican Jesus hate the poor and disabled? @SenJohnMcCain
I like this take
The Kill Bill
Sounds about right...
The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. If not, the many RISE UP to remove the few.
Or the Kill Bill. They are Murderers. And Cowards.
Let's call ObamaCare what it is: a failure
Sounds good!
No, let's call it what it really is. Reducing the burden of the poor & infirm on the rich.
Healthcare Holocaust Bill
If the health care bill is passed it should be called Healthcare holocaust.
A tax cut for the wealthiest Americans dresses up as a healthcare plan.
Standard reply to anything your opponents do.  Nobody takes you guys seriously anymore.
The free ride is over!
Let's make #TCMA as trending as #TrumpCare
You could also go with death bill
@GhostPanther have you read it or you just talking to Nancy P.
Please, make it stop! 
To the G.O.P. It's tax cuts for billionaires,  millionaires are just Puny Earthlings to them!
"Premeditated murder" is more like it.
Why isn't obvious that cuts in health care are just GOP speak for tax cuts for rich at the expense of the poor by reallocation  of tax $$$
It is also a proposal for genocide
Or #BitterCare
#DisabilityTax #SickKidTax #ChronicIllnessTax #AgeTax
No let's call it what it is, cut and paste Obunglecare. Repeal it all!!
And let's never again forget, elections matter!
#Wealthcare
Yes..... sneaks
Yes, calling it how we see it #WealthCare is not Healthcare
Let's also call it what it is; it's a coup. Democracy no more.
i.e.: wealthcare bill
When they promised to create policies that eliminate poverty in America, I didn't imagine they actually meant eliminate poor people.
I prefer to call it RINO-Care since it's Republicans looking out for their donors.
McConnell is lining his own pockets with this bill
How about the "Death Act"
Or, kill the poor act
Or simply, the Poor Sick People Should Die Bill.
dont vote for a new supreme court nominee sit on your hands
AHCA = TCMA
#WealthCare to replace #ObamaCare pathetic greedy @GOP will hurt millions of Americans to make their donors happy. Disgusting and shameful!
#Truth
Republicans do not believe health Care is a right. When you contact Washington they notice. Aide in Washington told me. Calls emails tweet.
#Wealthcare
The 1% INTENT on winning class war while they have majority, incl. SC majority.THEY are united in purpose & strategy; WE MUST UNITE to fight
I like "Wealth Care Act".
great
Until citizens realize that a class war is being waged against them as a "class of population" we will continue to be divided & distracted.
And let's call Repugs what they are: hatchet men for the 1% & corporate America.  This is a class struggle; an ideological struggle: a war.
No, it's "The Really WILL Kill Grandma Act."
Don't like, but definitely true. 
The wealthy care bill.
At a time of historic income inequality!
Or "Wealthcare" for short.
Hey explain that to me. I'm for real concerned
Or Wealthcare.
#WealthCare
WEALTHCARE
Insurance Company Enrichment Act! Pay Off GOP Donors Act! I could go on.
Call it "Wealth Care"!
Stephen King summarized it: You're on your own.
#HellerVoteNo #Resist
Could we reframe it more in terms of expected rise in mortality if it passes? Because to me that's the real issue.
Actually, billionaires.
MAGA: Millionaires Are Greedy, America
Lets call GOP leaders for what they are...Putin's bitches.
How many tax cuts have been retroactive?

Should be radioactive for GOP except4
VRA
CitizensUnited
Voter Suppression
VoterID
Gerrymandering
With death a collateral factor.
"Wealthcare" Republican Insurance Plan = R.I.P.
It's going to kill thousands of Americans sooner than than they have to die!
Please run for president!
Why this image is literally true!
Transfer of $1Trillion from Health Care to WealthFare
#AHCAKills
#WealthCare
#Wealthcare is partly apt, but that completely ignores the LETHAL consequences. That's why I'm calling it the #LetAmericansDieAct.

#noahca
I'd prefer #DeathCare since its literally murder for millions of people.
I thought it was the "Kill the Poor to Free Up More Money Plan"
@GhostPanther and Trump voters are ok with this even though they will be the 1st ones to be impacted by this.
#DonTCare Act
Yes!!!
#Wealthcare
Actually its a payback for $ given to his and other R's campaigns.
How about Tax Cuts For Millionaires Death Panel Act?
#WealthCare
Let's call it criminal &genocidal. People will be DYING. GOP are criminally greedy. We should have laws against this. It's disguised murder.
I want to call it "health insurance working class had before obama annihilated it". Call it whatever, just get it back
Honest question: why aren't you calling it TrumpCare?
That's my thought.  He hates that reference!
Because he doesn't want to associate himself with anything that fails or is viewed negatively. I say call it TrumpCare
Totally agree. Healthcare is important for all.   Completely satifisfied in Canada.
