WHEN THE KLAN HAD POWER: In the 1920s the KKK marched 50,000 men in hoods down 5th Ave in NY--they were headed to the Dem Nat'l Convention 
Shhh... @SenKamalaHarris Doesn't want you to spread the truth. Look into her background. She is in bed with Obama and the Muslim Brotherhood
The Democrats are going to try and run her for president in 2020. Too bad she has a legal issue!
Remind you of Eric Holder and/or Loretta Lynch. This is her circle. This is what Kamala Harris is about... corruption, greed and lawlessness
OMG. He really posted this. Really. No media misrepresentation! Straight from him: "Beautiful statues"! I'm done, signing off for today.
.@realDonaldTrump What about the true beauty YOU TORE DOWN building Trump Tower?? @CNN @msnbc @maddow @CBSNews @nytimes @ABC @washingtonpost
Trump has set out to destroy everything we as Americans hold dear and not the least of which is our National Monuments #SaveOurMonuments
...but they're insisting on preserving Confederate statues of #WhiteSupremacists & #NeoNazis - go figure.
The Trump admin needs to keep their hands off of everything. They have done more than enough damage!
Said by a person who's party is now taking down statues and monuments by the dozens.  Hypocrite
But it's okay for your delicate, sensitive snowflakes #Antifa to tear down historic monuments & leave statue of Robert Byrd up? #hypocrite
Just awaiting his face on Mt.Rushmore + Trump statues to replace Robert E Lee. Please impeach the entire administration.

BLM on the other hand, can destroy national monuments! De blasio could remove monuments??
Too bad you are such a hypocrite & DON'T support keeping hands off ALL monuments.  Interesting how you use the pronoun "their" VERY TELLING
Including the Confederate ones?
Kamala the whole thing is about BEARS EARS (Obama) & GSENM (Clinton). Please keep your eyes on this.
We should remove all the MLK statues next. He was a bigot and homophobe. No place for that in our country. Starting with this one
He wants to protect confederate racist monuments but destroy our natural ones 
People like you are so ridiculous do you ready to go to our home country and tel them to take down the pyramids? Built by slaves or anywhere
Muy  buenas mocjhes    y.  Seguirla
No but he has recommended shrinking bear down 
Will you tell state and local governments in CA to keep their hands of monuments within their jurisdictions too?
And crybabies should also
Where have you been?
Asleep?
Coma?
It's the Left destroying nat'l monuments
Stay on your break
Totally useless
How about taking down LENIN?
If only he cared about renaming our cultural treasures in Yosemite as much.
Goodnight PRAYERS
While radical Dems demand the removal of monuments they randomly find offensive.
Hands off CA
Trump should be impeached!
Some good news in an otherwise bleak week.
And now keep your hands off Bears Ears.
why weren't you all concerned about these confederate monuments before.
There should never be changes made to nature because nature will those charges on it's own.
So thank you @realDonaldTrump -- is what you meant to say, right? LOL
That's one
So much going on in the dismantling of govt, we need to contact Senate & Congress. 
Healthcare
Clean water & air
Police/prison 
Conservation
Even after appeasement you're sour. Typical.
Zinke is this century's James Watt
Thank you, Senator, for standing up for our #monumentsforall and other #publiclands!
Trump MUST keep his huge EGO and tiny, tiny, tiny, LITTLE HANDS off our Nation
Sincerely,
The American People
The Trump administrations MUST keep their HANDS OFF our NATION
Trump MUST be REMOVED
HANDS OFF #ALL OUR NATURAL MONUMENTS, PUBLIC LANDS, PARKS & WATERS, @ INTERIOR!!
Keep there hands off, that's funny, u calif libs have your hands on everything. Laughable at best
We pay for everything..... might as well have a say in everything. .....and it's "their."
Congrats!! This is called "getting things done!l.
Thank You for speaking out on this, Senator!! I've signed countless petitions & made dozens of calls. Why do they want to destroy the US?
Taxpayers are funding a Nazi Prez ? Really ?
Yep!
All minorities must get out on the streets to stop this violent Nazi now.
You and I both know that Trump is just waiting for someone to submit a proposal to have him carved on Mt. Rushmore, nothing is 2 far 4 Trump
.@KamalaHarris please keep us updated on our other monuments that are threatened. Will rally
And you should keep your hands off Confederate historical monuments.
On a scale of 1 to 10 @SenKamalaHarris how much do you really, really, really hate the 45th President of the United States?
Maybe they're starting to realize actions have consequences. We're awake and we're watching.
ALL  of our monuments..Hands off!
These ppl are destructive...why is this such a priority?
@LESTERJ205
DO NOT Trust @RyanZinke , he is a FRAUD MONTANA! Hands off of our lands Zinke!
The National Parks Service works for the President, nitwit.
There was never an intent 2 rid of them. Do U have 2 politicize all the Prez doesalready know Dems R obstructionists. U'll keep losing
Say what learn before you speak

Who has THE right to declare what is a national monument 

Clean up after yourselves @DNC
Now get your paws off Bears Ears in Utah Zinke. But Hatch and Lee can't wait to sell it off.
Geological study must be in. No oil I'm assuming...
They should not have tried in the first place 

It was only to spite Obama
And also - good job on this! But why do we have to fight so hard for what is right? This is exhausting!
In that case - I consider my body a monument so tell them to keep their hands off it and all decisions pertaining to it! @PPact
Only  reason is it'd be too hard to get the natural resources out of it I'd venture a guess it's something like that
What about this one?

Trump Plan Could Open This Giant Sequoia Monument to Logging http://mojo.ly/2uHwPtY 
Oh shit
Where did the first tweet you made go?
@Interior @SecretaryZinke @BLMca Great News, that's like 2 or 3 now!  Greatly relieved
... as well as the nuclear codes
Right!  Respect our terrains and wildlife.
Thank you for standing for our America.
my first lady president
