Kamala Harris --
The current health system will crash soon and Dems advocates and Obama are to blame! Lets see what happen when Americans loss thier care!
ACA needs minor surgery not organ replacement. PLEASE DEMS tell us what plan is to fix and repair. Now is your chance.
Thank You too Kamala.
Your determined leadership is a beacon for women all over our country. Thank you
Yes but do you read them, important to know. xoxoxoxo
You don't want a great America.  Bad.

Let's unite to give EVERY American the SAME health insurance our elected officials have. https://twitter.com/SenBlumenthal/status/887355916487733248 …
Thank you senator
Thank you for keeping the pressure on.
2/3 of my representatives drank the Koolaid & don't even bother to talk with us— @RepRutherfordFL, @marcorubio and I'm a Republican!
Can the @SenateDems please work with Republicans to make #ObamaCare better? It has its issues, don't play party politics!
Maybe if the Rs weren't so far to the right their faces are all smashed into each other there could be some progress.
Even though I can permanently be on my parents' insurance, I rely on Medicaid to pay a big part of my medical expenses like meds.
Wish my senators listened like you do! @SenatorIsakson @sendavidperdue ignore us in GA who fear for increases in premiums & huge Medicaid 
Why wait 4 ACA to fail? The Ins. Cos should meet and fix ACA, before the GOP makes it worse. You don't need 2 be told to do the right thing
Your tweets are informative, inspiring. inclusive. @realDonaldTrump feeds red meat to his shrinking base. Dishonest & hateful.
Single Payer Now!!  Anything less is unacceptable. #SinglePayerNow #DraftBernie
Thank you @SenKamalaHarris
But we must remember it was defeated from the far Right (Moran) which wants even less healthcare spending; ideally they want none.
Congratulations! Democratic Party again has taken ownership of a Healthcare system that is failing. Premiums rising, Insurers pulling out!

Yes democrats have done great work on healthcare..this lady is an idiot ..u wouldn't hire govt to build your house..why run healthcare?

@SenKamalaHarris can you please run for #2020?
Our next president 
Yea
Dems are looking weak though. Sitting back and allowing @SenMajLdr walk all over them. @GOP are breaking all of the rules. Please fight back
Dems & Reps r  ot letting him walk over them they r stonewalling @SenMajLdr..they r rebelling
Not a single Democratic vote to repeal ACA which is dying daily. How tragic!!!   Premiums up, deductibles up, choices declining daily!!!!
Now let's push to get this Russian loving administration out of office. We support you.
The new bill was a lite version of ACA, so I don't get why you disliked it, apart from partisanship - if a #FullRepeal comes up, Vote YES
Don't be fooled...Kamala is a viper! https://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/no-sanctuary-danielle-bologna …
Everyday the majority wake up ready for new fight every time we feel tired and sometimes hopeless people like you inspire us and pave theway
Even tho trump ppl were willing to let grandma get booted out of their rest homes 2 placate a pervert con man your welcome.And thank you!
Thank you so much for your dedication! We appreciate it! Yes, we do send our tweets to #ProtectOurCare #SaveMedicaid We MUST fight 4 them!
Lol. No it's not. GOP can't get their shit together. Has nothing to do with your BS protests.
Thank you for your efforts to block this bill, Senator. Please continue to protect Americans and provide health insurance to us all.
Now they're looking to just repeal and not replace?! I'm confused. I just spent 5-1/2 hours at Kaiser Urgent Care because I've had a...
headache for 11 days. I had to have a CT scan, plus the doctor & meds. I paid $190 for all because I have Ocare. Can't imagine what it'd...
be without it. Thank you to you and fellow senator @SenFeinstein for looking out for the people of California. Let me know how I can help! 
Thank you for supporting healthcare.  I only wish I had TWO senators with spine.  Thanks Florida @SenBillNelson & shame on @senmarcorubio
Thank you and @SenFeinstein for standing up for us in this fight! #countryoverparty
Thank you, thank you, thank you Senator for all you are doing
I hope while we're adding pressure you all are drafting a fix to the ACA. We didn't hand you the keys to the car to drive us off the cliff

Trumpeters need understand w trump care they not going to get any insurance cause they have a preexisting condition : they're mentality ill
I would for you to make a run against this IMP in 2020 if he's not impeached by then. You would a great candidate. Just put it out there.
I meant 2 say I would love for 2 run for President in 2020 against this IMP if the brown nose Rep hypocrites enablers failed 2 impeach him.
Thank you Senator! You're a true patriot and resistor!
Thanks for the fight, and please let me know when you're single..:)
Thank you for all your hard work and for never giving up!
You got it sister, thanks for fighting for all of us
Thanks Kamala!

Any good reason why single-payer system not being pushed? Medicare has fraud waste and abuse, but so does everything. Medicare for all!
Good point. I think the public is open to it now.

This, GOP voters, is how a Real politician is & acts. You need to let go your unworkable relationship w/the GOP, for they care Not for you.
Thank you for being a straight politician,but more importantly,a compassionate human being who cares.need more like you.
I see a potential 2020 presidential campaign in the works her. Seems you're going to fight it out with @CoryBooker
KAMALA 2020
I know how to tweet as well...

#ForEverSanders
If you aren't pushing #SinglePayer you're just negotiating over acceptable number of uninsured and poor deaths is acceptable.
Keep up the good work Sen Harris!
Thank you for continued efforts. America needs strong leaders like you, now more than ever.
Thank you senator harris.
Harris for President 2020
They need to work with the democrats to better the ACA and not repeal it
We the American people would never give up the fight they need to reach out to the democrats and work together on the ACA
Senator Harris fight the good, the people don't want Trumpcare. Trump needs to stop tweeting and golfing learn how to play well with others.
We Will.continue to fight, the healthcare plan, it should be made physicians and medical in the scientific community,.No by  republicans
Thank you Sen Harris!!!!
Yes, our voices can be heard.
Now will Trump dismantle ACA on his own?
You better believe America does
Thanks for your tireless advocacy
Beautiful woman you are with us.
Now is the time for Dems to offer bill to fix shortcomings of ACA. It's good start but it can be better. We can't be the party of "no" only
Thank McCain's clot too! I prefer heroes who don't get blood clots.
Can you please say whose vote has been impacted by the 'resistance' whatever the hell that means.
Yes we do, that... Gratitude, Senator Harris!
Here is the next step. #CongressCare for all! Lead it, Senator! https://dorothyhagan.com/2017/03/16/healthcare-solution-congresscare/ … And thank you for your leadership!
can Dems start working on improving ACA? Please. Maybe bring in moderate Republicans?
Once again the GOP health bill has failed. Thank you for your dedication to a cause that is so important. Now we fight on! #Harris2020
So Mike Lee decided to vote no, because of the resistance? Whose vote exactly was impacted by the 'resistance'
This self-employed ACA consumer is ever so thankful that the bill has stalled! ACA is alive & well in MA & has been since it was Romneycare
THANK YOU! I Love calling your office every day
and then there was 4!  now maybe my new home in AZ will come through with 2 more no's?
At least your tweets are much more decent then Trump's. And at least we have that to thank for.
Thank you for standing up @SenKamalaHarris!! We need your voice for all of us!! #Nurse #SaveTheACA #HearUS
Sen Lee of Utah and Sen Moran of Kansas just said "NO"!
Thank you for all your hard work Sen Harris!!!
Thank YOU!!!!
It's not working... Mike Lee is a Constitutionalist. He was never going to vote for it. Be intellectually honest.
Nothing you have done has mattered on this. The people voting no, were always going to vote now on how this legislation is written.
No, thank you!
