@KidCasteel Can humans hide in these sanctuaries? #NorthKorea
1/ This is an extremely important cause! Unfortunately there are so many destructive measures happening all at once, destroying many
2/ treasures and institutions in our country. There's just so much we can't even keep up!

Today would be a good day for Senator & Mrs Transparency to release their complete tax returns.
At least Bernie didn't send encrypted government secrets over an unsecure server or sell uranium to Russia

What do I do to help
It seems if blacks were a, fish, you would be more concerned with white supemacy attacking us like Marine sanctuaries.
Why does one negate the other? She is fighting hard for bail reform and criminal justice on many fronts!
That's like saying Trump is fighting hard to repeal the affordable health Care act. In the end she knows white supremacy stays in Power.
Ha.  No.
How about focusing on foreign policy , your liberalism will bring down this country . Focus on the toxic pot you have

Thank you for posting this link. I just commented on both the marine and monuments and asked they leave our precious natural area's alone.
Just curious - off subject - What is it about "Sharia Law" that Democrats like @MaxineWaters don't understand ?? Surely, you do understand !

Russian bot or someone who could care less about Sanders' reputation? So hard to tell these days.

She is not a leader & never will be. Another corrupt demon for sheeple to worship. She's a female Obama. No 1 will ever vote for her.
You R just as corrupt as Killary, and you will NEVER win against President Trump. Your wickedness will also be revealed.

Indivisible guide for leaving a comment.
@SenKamalaHarris how? What should we do?
We need to protect our valuable ecosystem. Vote to maintain marine sanctuaries
Kamala, more direction, please? Who to call, how to protest, what are the concentrated points of greatest impact. Standing by ready to help!

She is not serious about this. No link, no facts, no theat, no sciencejust pandering to sympathy voters.
Notice "we" have to do this, not her. Apparently  no votes in the ocean. The fish have their ecology. You swim in a different water, a swamp
