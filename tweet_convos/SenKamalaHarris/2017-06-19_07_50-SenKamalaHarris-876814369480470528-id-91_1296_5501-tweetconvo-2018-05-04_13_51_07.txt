get the 13th amendment amended; slavery must be 100% abolished & never used as punishment for a crime.
The goal, and don't let anyone push you around while you are doing your part - thanks for your work on behalf of all
Let's celebrate Kamala Harris Day,
America's new HERO!
Very grateful you will fight 4 our rights & ask the hard q's.
Nevertheless u PERSIST!
Keep it up senator. History will reflect democrats efforts during these dark days and will be very kind. Keep up the fight!
You know you're owning them as a woman when they feel compelled to silence you. Work it girl!
I like it Kamala, but what does it mean??
Give some thought, Alex. It'll come to you.
Saint Patty's Day whoohoo! Cinco De Mayo yippee! Juneteenth.. Crickets, and I'm supposed to salute a flag
Thank You for All You've done & continue to do to advance Our Country in a More Harmonious Union ⚘
It's the 21 century and has not happened yet but we always have faith !!!! And new generations 
The perfect union would be one without Democrats. Exterminate them like the filthy cockroaches they are.
Just like Wonder Woman, love conquers hate.

Thank you for your efforts to make it so.
A good start would be to outlaw lobbying!
And true freedom for ALL people.
We need to break our union with you. That's the first step towards unity.

We will celebrate when u abolish the current slavery we are facing but u quiet  Did some1 silence u? Can't hear  speak up
The blood of many cultures on earth. Yet, that same colored blood saves lives! Why can't we identify as a one colored world and do the same.
I think we are already doing that, it's just your definition of a perfect nation and mine are not the same
Yes, and withhold consent in the Senate until transparency and due process are restored.
Quit being so divisive and hold all politicians to the same standards!
Maybe your followers should pool their $ to send u to Cotillion to learn proper manors.ur performance at the hearing 
Great idea,!!!!    too bad half the country has no idea what you're talking about.
You made your mark in the world  now take Trump out.
Maybe if we stop with the self segregation that would be possible.
Yes Ma'am!

Establishing JUSTICE is key. Thank you for your service to that end, Madam.
