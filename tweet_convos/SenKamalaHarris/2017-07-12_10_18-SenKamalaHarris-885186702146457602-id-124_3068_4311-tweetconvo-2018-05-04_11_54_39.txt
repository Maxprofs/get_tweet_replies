It's already happening....
So I've been wondering if my local ISP could block progressive sites or even my news program DemocracyNow?
I see what you did there.
Russian hackers need to get use to this if you know what I mean
Thanks for that there goes another moment in my life I'll never get back.
Isn't this normal? It is in Oregon!
Net Neutrality, shutting of war crimes office, Ethics Office crippled, EPA gutted, dumbing down education, Zero Climate Change-MAGA? REALLY!
But how do we stop them?
You totally got me. Early morning brain.
Oh, it took me a few seconds too, lol.  Then the light bulb came on.
you know whats worse than the dark web?
no open internet for literally all of us that use it
Soooooo true
Yep
Geez...it took me one irritating sec before I realized what you are showing us!!! I live in a rural community with right wing conservatives
I would drop it! You and Bernie and Tulsi would have to mail us letters. I am angered just to think back to the days of 56K. :)
More liberal hype & fake news...

Also looks like me waiting for @GOP this respond to all the lying  I n the administration. Oh wait, they're lying too. #fakegovernment
Ahhh...I get it now.
SAD
Too funny, I'll laugh when the tears stop
I'm embarrassed of you
Well social media does criticize the gop,so naturally they want to get rid of it
And here's what the internet could look like with centralized control:
See what you did there.
Oh...so the government is working on a technical solution....that is what it looks like.

You mean worse than it already is?
yes
I waited for this to load for about two minutes.

Well played.
I heard the sound of dial-up.
This is the good example why we support to $SUB
That was epic hahaha.
Why?
#NetNeutrality  because the #GlobalWarming #Hoax and #Russian #Conspiracy story aren't enough to make us #Barf 
As opposed to how it has been working without net neutrality??? Let's not ruin something else by interjecting government intervention.
I get that Now,its already here!
Yes it didnt function at all before 2015
It could look like it looked pre-2015 when those rules were implemented.
OR some scary fearmongering bullsh*t...

Which did you choose?
Why?
murca
Non americans can comment as well! :) Join the fight!
I have.  ages ago.

Another lie from @TheDemocrats:
Corporate GREED @ its WORST!!!!
Thank you for taking a stand for Net Neutrality. Can't believe we have to fight for this AGAIN!
Gruppa krovi na rukove
 Omg, this so annoying. Definite retweet! #NetNeutrality
You don't know what you've got until it is gone!
Save net neutrality!!
There is nothing free or open about #NetNeutrality.
My Comcast internet is so slow already that it took a while for this to actually load.

Complete BS!
Go away
Perfect! THAT gets all of our attention!

And I thought the dial-up speed was no more. 
Excellent depiction!
Thank you for your stance on this issue. I am proud to have you representing me.
Me: waiting for the image to load
If you and the dems are for it,  i know for a fact its no good for the american people. You can take that to the bank koala.
Without net neutrality, I wouldn't be able to use all my favorite @SenKamalaHarris  gifs...
Or, here on Twitter, "The media could not be played."
This tweet just made me happy I voted for you.
What will it look like? Won't load
#Bullship That is what it looks like with #NetNeutrality
AAAAAHH...THATS SO FUCKING ANNOYING,!
Superb. I'm looking forward to see #NetNeutrality impact on the Internet
Perfect. I waited too long. 
Thank u 4 fighting for net neutrality, Sen. Harris!
Ugg mines bad enough thanks
Call Trump Tweet Trump stop change of internet. Thank you
Looks like the democrats running in circles hoping and praying lmao it'll load just wait for it..there it..nope..wait thats it..nope
Kind of like your political career.
They are trashing education, healthcare, environment, & media. The internet is practically the only thing we have left. THE WILL TRASH IT
Considering that here in Northern California I have exactly one option for internet, I see this all the time...and pay more for it.
Why support giving away control of the internet then?  #NetNeutrality
So if #NetNeutrality is such a good thing, why do we still have huge ISP monopolies? Why don't we have more competition in the ISP market
I am patiently waiting...for Kamala to become President!!!
@peletechcorp ...supports all of the efforts to preserve #NetNeutrality today and each and every day!
Your  (EYE)  look towards the camera  in the Senate Assembly Chamber after my tweet to you. VOTING, Sen. Kamala Harris, TRUTH
Without #NetNeutrality we'd have to go back to teletext! 
Imagine seeing this when trying to access your twitter account?
Thank you for calling attention to this critical issue! I don't think people appreciate the potential ramifications of no net neutrality.
Agreed.
It's like people don't remember pre-2015 when the internet didn't exist because these rules weren't there...

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Thank you for standing up for #NetNeutrality!
If you think consumers would pay for that you are misguided at best. 

#NetNeutrality is diversion at its best.
I teach & use computers & internet for every class! We don't have time to waste sitting & waiting for pages to load!!
And we are at the mercy of Comcast etc. they ALREADY squeeze money out of us and pull bait and switch on channels to get MORE $$. Horrible.
And do we really think the cable companies will give Netflix Hulu etc bandwidth. #NetNeutrality
Plus how is the world going to view Trumps Pee Pee tape when that leaks???
Well that's really annoying.  We must stop this.
California needs to lead fight to save #NetNeutrality
Hilarious! U don't know how many times I tried 2 reload the gif B4 I got it! Why don't u have millions of followers by now?
That looks like you when you try to explain how Socialism will grant people more freedom.
Would it affect the dead?
Acknowledged. Don't like
Should add the aol dial up sound.
The elimination of Net Neutrality would negatively impact small business, where the majority of ppl work. Another gift to 1%, like AHCA
please do whatever you can to stop this!!  what else will they take from the American citizens?
I almost tried to refreash the page. I've been well trained by the net.
Well put Senator 
#SaveNetNeutrality 
Signed,
Your CA Constitutents
Amen in that
Exaggerate much?
an improvement
The FCC is stacked w/pro big biz types, furthering gilding the lily for the swamp folks. Wasn't cleaning out the swamp the pledge. Oops!
exactly! It's so thick w/Wall Street types, the bulls & bears are dancing.

Please, don't let them do it!!!
This is what the internet looks like to @comcast and @ATT without #NetNeutrality $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Kamala noooo D: help us save the internet!
#kamala2020
Not for rich people.
