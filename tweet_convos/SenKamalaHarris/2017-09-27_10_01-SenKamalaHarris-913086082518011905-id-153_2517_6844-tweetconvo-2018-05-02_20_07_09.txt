Walk your talk. You failed to prosecute Vulture Capitalist Mnuchin. Now his gang of thieves controls USA treasury & plunders Puerto Rico!
it did !! $5Billion to start. What GOVT needs is to pay for cruise lines and do 21 day stays on ships for people without homes!
Our President did that hours ago.Waived the rules even.
It SHOULD have happened immediately after the storm hit. Everyone in govt is too late. Immediate asst was offered to FL and TX, why not PR?
It WAS offered 2 PR as soon as they could establish communication.Hello,PR isnt on the mainland.It cant possibly happen as fast.Geography101
It could have been sent day 1. Far better planning could have happened from before the storm even hit. I blame ALL branches.
Have you seen this?
Mi senadora.  Muy  love bella.  No puedo. Estar.  Sin. Ti.  Estemos juntos
The key word here is "should" let's see "fight against Americans standing up for their rights" or "help Americans in dire need".... hmmm?..1
2/ this "should" be a simple answer. Americans will die if we do not rush to help them.
Yea what's the hold up?
Necesiito. Mucho. De ti muy. Love.   Kamalita    acostarse. Y. Despertar. Llam
As my senator please author a bill for relief in Costa Rica thank you
That's great, but why did you vote for an INCREASE to the #MilitaryBudget when we have no idea where our $ goes?
Your congress sucks, they pass nothing. Once again Trump takes action to help.
Happy 2C that U have remembered the USVI also.
Obviously 7583 other points are more important! What a shame!!!
Its unbelievable what is happening in PR.  So much worse than beem reported.  Please help now!!!!!
I've noticed a singular lack of news about the Virgin Islands. Are they citizens like Puerto Ricans? USVI are islands too. Does 45 evenknow?
Why aren't food, water and meds being dropped by planes?!?!?!!!
Help me help a lot of ppl are just talk https://www.gofundme.com/4hujtig 
Jones Act needs to go.
Don't expect a thing from Do Nothing #Dotard in @WhiteHouse or The Insane Clown Posse in @GOP Congress.
Ignorance & Cowardice rule the realm
Hey now...don't give Insane Clown Posse a bad name!
You right! Sorry...

this is what happens when you are "part" of a nation, but left without both the vote and representation. ALL citizens should be able to vote
REPEAL Jones Act. Since 1917 it has allowed vulture capitalists 2 plunder Puerto Rico 4 profit. Corp climate change intensifies the plunder.
Hpla  kamalita. My love  mi. Be lka.  Mi  senadora.    Llamsme  te. Quiero  mucho
To @realDonaldTrump ,he could care less. No potential votes and would not vote for him anyway. In addition, he is a horrible human being.
supplies sitting @ Port but no 1 to deliver. We deliver help across the globe but not 4 our own American brothers & sisters? #Send drivers.
Kamala / Biden 2020
Why aren't they?
Your voice is required. The situation especially for the poor and elderly are critical. We here in the island simply drift in darkness.
RT! RT! SCREAM THIS!
NOTHING ELSE MATTERS TODAY!

NEGLECT OF #PUERTORICO is the culling genocide of brown U.S. citizens.

#helppuertoriconow
45 needs 2 get off his ass & do his #ExecutiveOrder he loves 2 do & bypass #JonesAct  How many more PEOPLE HV 2 DIE 4 HIM 2 WTF UP? @POTUS
He needs to step up & not play politics now!!
Should also start Impeachment . Of Donald J. Trump..
Dems need. To own this and move aid to people of PR
Suspend the jones act, let humanitarian services in!
Abolish the Jones Act
And this WH needs to stop jones-ing with the Jones Act. This is Trump's Katrina. Just as poorly managed. Yet no one holding him accountable.

Kamala, what is the best Organization to donate financially to Puerto Rico?
How do we help ask the DoD suspend the #JonesAct again? They did it For Texas after Irma. It Expired Sept 22, 2017.
$7 Million aid 
A Joke
Works out to $2/person
Send in the military now. This isn't just a natural disaster, it's a crisis.
What's the delay?
YES!  Until then havemilitary helicopters deliver the supplies off the ship.  Docking seems to be the problem.  Thanks for your efforts.
Please try and keep the state tax deduction in the new tax code. As a Californian you know we pay high state taxes
Does Trump even know that Puerto Rico is a US Territory?  She seems to be treating is like Cuba.
And repeal the Jones Act
Send @RusselHonore he can take charge and get things moving like he did in New Orleans after Katrina. Administration is stuck on stupid
Our president didn’t know PR “is an island, an island “ and they are citizens of US! Dumb and dumber
PR is living like it’s the 1800’s. NK is ready to resume the War. Russia selected our president and trump talikin’ about players kneeling...

John McCain is pushing an idea that could be a huge help to Puerto Rico http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-mccain-puerto-rico-jones-act_us_59caebd1e4b02aef6cd6061d?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004 …
Do you get paid to lie I'm sorry yes you do you're a Democrat 10,000 boots on the ground shipments going in every day to Puerto Rico
I understand the aid is there, but there are not truck drivers to pick up at the docks and distribute because most lines of comm are down.
Thank you!!!!! #PuertoRicoNeedsHelpNow
Thank you!!!!!! #VI and #PR.  #Standfirm
How long until the investigation is opened to the deaths of people ignored out in Puerto Rico by the president of the USA?
A friend reports the body of a relative floating from a cemetary. Humanitarian crisis. We must act now, please.
@realDonaldTrump is making aid difficult by siding with industry on the Jones Act. Congress is only hope. Please help our fellow citizens!
Push for the jones act to be lifted!!
Dem leadership should talk Trump into lifting the Jones Act at the very least for the duration of this emergency.
Dear Sen. Harris, Congress should also being taking steps to remove @realDonaldTrump He is dangerous,emotionally unstable & unfit for Office
absolute disaster in Puerto Rico- BTW #HelpPuertoRicoNow not even trending
It's being done.  You should know. You are still participating, right?
And repeal the Jones Act.
Agree! Right now!!!
Waive the Jones Act! the nepotism is unreal. Elaine Chao shouldn't be profiting from this disaster! @potus paying for votes again?
Wasn't a hurricane aid package already approved? Was there language in it preventing use in Puerto Rico?
Get off of the golden throne and send all available relief to these Americans in need now! #PuertoRicoRelief #WaiveJonesActforPR
It's there at the port.  Need roads cleared and trucks.  Gas stations are open. Fuel has been delivered.
Please send your National Guard to help PR. We must work together to save PR. @timkaine @RepAdamSchiff @SenFranken @SenWarren @SenSanders
#JonesAct
You are a member of Congress...so why send this tweet?
You should resign, you have no place among the people. Your a race baiting ignorant child. YOU are the problem.
They have been suffering for a week with minimal assistance. This is another Katrina all over again. Horrible.
Why? They can't vote for you..
Shouldn't even need to think about it.
You aren't sharing links on how to help? Where to donate?
Again, what are you personally doing today? You gonna build your candicy on "SHOULD" and passing the buck too?
GOP is busy trying to destroy American lives rather than help them. Trump is an idiot not helping.

#PuertoRicoRelief 
#ImpeachTrump
It’s already been too long! They should have acted over a week ago.
Our whole country needs help #ImpeachTrump
I’m asking this again. If airport not fully functional. Why can’t we get a Military ship out there to evacuate ppl off the island?
Where is the Hollywood telethon?
Thank you Senator Harris!
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan what the hell is wrong with you step up and help them!!!
Senator, private humanitarian shipments (containers all across the US) are being blocked and warehoused BC of the Jones act. Please help.
The aid has been sitting on the docks for days, 3,000 containers of it.
Newcomer from California sanctuary left-wing politics would destroy MEDICARE To save a rotten moribund hoax OBAMASNARE. Deductibles soar!

Why is this not the only damn thing congress is doing? People do NOT spray paint Save Our Souls after major storm as a joke. They need Us
Sociopath Trump attacking FB players-talking tax lies while absolute disaster in Puerto Rico- BTW #HelpPuertoRicoNow not even trending
Senator Harris please try to pass something forcing Trump to show his taxes! He shouldn't personally benefit from tax policy passed!!!!!
Why does it take  act of Congress? Why isn't there a protocol in place to set in motion. It's obvious to the world. We look stupid. Act now.
Lame Congress
Why is this such a struggle? We know Trump is a racist and cares not about people of color, but Congress can't act? Are they ALL racists???
What can you do to make that happen, Senator?
We need you to lead the way to ask for an emergency hearing to repeal the Jones Act. People in Puerto Rico are dying. You have the courage.
Senator, please work to rescind or at least suspend Jones Act. We need to streamline, not hinder, the logistical response - a constituent.
#HEISTRYINGTOKILLUS, Meanwhile my friends r raising money 2 airlift pregnant women to Florida tomorrow. 20K only 2k so far. #NotLookingGood
California should also look at following NY's lead and sending aid ourselves. We're a patron state, we could and we should.
Y aren't we sending in ships w/National Guard/amphibious vehicles/supplies & manpower??? My father lived there. These are OUR people! #Help
I know you would!
But it's an island! How can we possibly get them aid?
Get to work Kamala
We are behind you
Why aren't you demanding Tom Price be fired immediately???
Aren't you Congress?
Why hasn't the Jones Act been waived?
OIL companies profit with hideous prices.
. . .and obviously the US shipping industry!
Unfortunately I fear our brothers and sisters in #PuertoRico  are a "bit to brown" to warrant the @POTUS attention  Pray I wrong .I do
The Jones Act has to be lifted!
Yes!!!! Asap!
Appears you just woke up Senator.
#TrumpHelpPuertoRicoNOW
Help w/cut thru bureaucratic levels 2 get aid moving NOW, PLZ.
NO work in Congress should move forward until an aid package to PR & USVI is passed. What could be a higher priority? (Except NK escalation)
Harris 2020!!
Should be in the past tense
6,000 people need dialysis in PR. Without power, no dialysis, no life. Ventilators not working due to no power. Adults and children dying.
Please act today. Deploy military/all it takes for PR/VI crisis. Need leader & funds: provide logistics/plan stop suffering/dying ASAP!
Exactly!
GOP wanted the power and all they do is abuse it.Too many career politicians and term limits r needed,if anything is to get done
You're absolutely right. No time to waste! Quit typing and hop on a plane. They need you!
Waive the Jones Act
Sign off Jones Act should have been done instead of wasting valuable time on debate.  Mass exodus, brown peeps ignored.
Many of you are very late with this... wish #Congress & @realDonaldTrump took action like @NYGovCuomo
Amen! Nothing else should be done until we get help to our fellow Americans!!
Thank you! 
#TrumpHelpPuertoRicoNOW
Don't worry, @realDonaldTrump is on it. He's sending aid in the form of rage against black athletes. Priorities, you know..
He's disgracing himself & his country as usual! Squatting in WH under false pretences!
Like the kenyan snake did?
@SpeakerRyan Is too worried about tax reform to do his job .He hates poor people so he has no care
A friend writes, "I have heard of such people, but I don't believe that before Trump I had actually seen a person born without a soul."
AND Waive the JONES ACT for long enough to recover!
So get off Twitter and act
Let's do this!!!  And thank you for urging DOE @SecretaryPerry to restore Puerto Rico's power grid!
yes you are right
ATTENTION
1000s are dying in Puerto Rico
Trump Won't Help
