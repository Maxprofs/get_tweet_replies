How many people do you have tweeting for you?
We had no regulations under boom. Do you understand how open markets work?
The change to Title II didn't come until well after the boom wasn't a boom anymore.
Regulators always seize business innovation instead of helping. Look at Bell. It was regulated for years until deregulation led to iPhone
So you want the ISPs, who don't have true free market structure due to prohibitive startup infrastructure costs, to be unregulated?
If they screw it up, ppl will switch venders like Verizon to Sprint for example
For wireless maybe, but many people don't have many options for home/business Internet.
Consider this. Do you prefer govt monopoly Post office or FedEx or UPS. Generally 100% better service at private mail
The two aren't comparable. And I wouldn't want an unregulated company in charge of our country's mail system.

Asset forfeiture Jeff sessions the police have taken more things from ppl then burglars-- police robbery 5B$$ burglary losses 3B$$
Spot on. Now if we can get attention - well someone to pay attention beside those who want to slice the pie.
Half the time I don't bother making calls to you or Barbara Lee because I trust that the both of you represent all of your constituents not
Absolutely right on target, & brilliantly articulated!

Keep the internet free.  No net neutrality.

Kamala Harris, next President of the United States. She got my vote. We need someone with grit and conviction to stand up to the RATS.
