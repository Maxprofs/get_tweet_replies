Be honest, Kamala, you don't really know what you're talking about, do you.
To @SafeLibraries "It's easier to fool people than to convince them they've been fooled" Tump & GOP put nail in oligarchy coffin.
Wow, look at all the female insurance executives in that picture. Amazing!
couldn't hav said it better!

The most important one? How to pay for liberal grandese
Who didn't? The millions who lost their plan & doctor cause Obama/Dems LIES! Don't we exist ?
So...chump's mission accomplished?
They want to let them die. They only care about the wealthy who are their big donors. Greed over country!
@chloewepper That's great I'm wondering who's paying for the 20 million The people paying are probably working60 hours/week
@potus That Unethical Serial Lying @realDonaldTrump will turn anything into a Photo-Op.
10 Million in that number is Medicaid. Terrible  healthcare results. ACA benefits if subsidy applies, otherwise huge price
@rackintheresa @KeithOlbermann @SenSanders @realDonaldTrump
One solution. Single payer. Imagine taking all the profit from health insures and rolling that into just health care.
Um, I think you missed the point. Overpaid corporate execs hog the funds.
That's what we call a yooooge assumption. And a false equivalency. Nice try though.
@LisaHauser8
@realDonaldTrump   Truth! Sad!
I hope they all choke on their newly found cash.
- The corrupt GOP in bed with insurance companies! Don't care what the ppl want or need! ACA had 2 change due 2 racist GOP!
are you listening Trump supporters. You have been taken for a ride!
@HeightMen your number is wrong.  Now how many got hurt by ACA?   Do you even care??
How many?
there are $23m in ng market.  9m are subsidized. That leaves 14m that are getting creamed.
14 million in what tax bracket?
irrelevant.  Hurt is hurt
THIS is why it needs to go away now! #FULLREPEAL NO #ObamacareLite
You realize there are other people in this country besides one in that clip?
to my point.  People were hurt.  Try to recognize redistribution creates winners AND losers
Obamacare made my deductible increase to $5000. I can't afford healthcare tho I have insurance because of the ACA @SenKamalaHarris
That's the exact message of the Ark gov interviewed on PBS today. Get better job w/ better ins.  #Soulless
@donnabrazile
There you are ladies, not one in sight. In 8 yrs, the only thing that will change is they will be older.
How many smiling legal criminals in the picture? How many smiling treasonous criminals in the picture?
They do look sick. Especially that one in the middle who can't even stand up.
I wonder which will come first,the heart attach or the impeachment
Option 2 please. I wouldn't wish the 1st on anyone. Besides, watching him go thru impeachment would be fun.
Grotesque.
hell yes fuck lazy poor ppl
I lose my insurance with the ACA repeal! But republicans  don't care.
why because you are on the free ride.
because I'm young and they won't give tax credits anymore. Not going to pay $500/month like I used to before the ACA!
you have no idea what you are going to pay. I pay 1400 a month for me and the wife and a 1300 mortgage. Double since ACA. Fair
my insurance was $600 for myself a healthy young person before the ACA. Same insurance was half that under ACA.
The party of no taxes! Ha!
I wish I could tax you
What about the 300million who are unable to buy/use Obamacare due to high cost & high deductables
How will the new plan change that?
From what I can tell, it's still in the works. Couldn't be any worse.
from what was release yesterday it is worse. Less coverage at a higher cost.
This will explain a lot.
And, who suffered families like mine who have had their insurance changed 6 times & now can't get treatment for illness.
I am so sorry to hear that 
Thank you, all prayers empathy and prayers are welcome, amazing what your tweet did for my mood .
I'll get better I promise, keep faith
Thanks for yor kind thoughts.
Thank u for being honest about their plan.  His supporters won't care until they lose their healthcare
that pic by itself just LOOKS evil.
@deejay90192 
Is this a hornet's nest?
who isn't required to be apart of ACA? Oh yeah-you.
@donnabrazile ..that is one scary picture..did anyone explain health care to Trump..he said it is too confusing..help him.
A whole lot of people r not thinking, when u go from 1 end of the spectrum 2 the other, w/o stopping @ fixing problems.
Where r the adjustments that make sense chart? Any1 enterprising enough n Congress 2 produce that? The people r waiting.
How do we fix, add, & build ACA? The people really want 2 know. They don't want 2 hear party immaturity on the subject.
time for single payer...take these guy's and their huge profits completely out of the loop...
please calculate benefits from #trumpcare for the Trump Cabinet - how many millions$$ will they save?
Notice Trump is smiling. He never smiles, but he just screwed poor & middle class America, so he's smiling.
@donnabrazile what's HYSTERICAL is that he called these guys "Healthcare PROVIDERS". Few, if any, are DOCTORS!
Who get employer-sponsored health ins, and who can afford to buy it if they had to. #resist #ResistTrump #saveaca #ProtectOurCare
@donnabrazile #ThisIsTheGOP #PartyOfTrump #PartyOfPutin #PartyOfTreason #PartyOfLies #NewConfederateParty #GOCCCP
"These insurance executives" and the wealthiest 2% who receive tax cuts from it.
@AbelUndercity thanks for the recap
@donnabrazile 
Who are the hard working people stuck paying for Medicaid? It's time for people to work for what they need.
@donnabrazile  Because #TrumpDon'tCare!
@donnabrazile We ALL benefit from ACA provisions re preventative care,  no life caps, kids til 26, limit on ins co profits
This smile will always be the smile of that tweet about the taco bowls.
sad.
@GreenUS4  And people actually thought he cared about the little guy in middle America. He's such a joke!
yayyyyyy
@JustWhatNowWhy Trump already killing Obamacare by not enforcing payment of mandate: this needs to be called out now
and the rich folks the gop carries water 4.
@GravityisRising I'm so happy
Trumpcare.
#Trumpcare leaves the poor and old out in the cold.
@LarryJFJF That photo looks like death, to me.
This bill is extremely cruel. Americans will surely die. Families will go bankrupt and suffer. Rationing is back. STOP IT.
@fritzco64 You're a new senator albeit elected purely on PC culture but at least try to make up some new propaganda.
we outnumber them #VOTE RESIST
@conniewhitehome   You are totally correct!
@conniewhitehome   THE WEALTHY WOULD BENEFIT FROM THAT STUPID IDIOT'S plan that RYAN DREAMED UP TO SCREW US PER KOCHS!
obsmacare not failing. Greedy ins co want more $$$ holding country hostage. gOP happy to comply w their demands
then why don't you do your job and fix it
@RepJohnFaso on women's day #NY19  says SHAME on GOP HEALTHCARE WAR against women, the old, & sick. No Lives for tax cuts.
@hopesprings46 Americans should find a way to boycott most of these insurance companies.
#CrockPOTUS #tRump is about to see his promised #TrumpDontCare #ACA replacement in the dumpster. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/07/trump-republicans-defend-heathcare-act-democrats-mess â€¦ #ObamaCare @funder
Watch out #Hillary! #CrockPOTUS #tRump may grab / snatch your portrait without your permission. #theResistance #Resistance @funder #DNC #ACA
so the ACA is ok even though the hardest working Americans saw their premiums double and triple and lost choices promised?
someone else who is working for votes and not Americans-you!!!
. @SenKamalaHarris ACA needs to remain for now, but plenty of your constituents like me still know healthcare to be a luxury #SinglePayerNow
Is this a photo from A Day Without a Woman?
@dhaynes101 And, on this #daywithoutawomen , not one woman in  the photo. THIS is the problem competent women face at work.
@realDonaldTrump Donny, you have been exposed again for the true fraud that you are.
@HouseGOP @SenateGOP REPUBLICANS!! Get ready to find yourselves UNEMPLOYED if you pass #TrumpCare.
and not a single one of them pays a penalty for having a uterus
They don't look like they would have to give up their iPhones in order to have healthcare
@Carolyn17657464 And they're the ones who w make the profits & not being taxed for it. What a deal...!!! #swampies
@BernardJTyson See you here Mr. Tyson, do you actually fight for what you spoke to at Dream Force last year?
@Dovewoman1 #StopPresidentBannon
Senator, would you be in favor of a single-payer health care system in CA?  If the feds won't act, let's do it in CA.
We the American people are screwed with this plan. I will have to work until I die, to keep my employer health care..
Should be rebranded to TrumpDontCare
reasonably insured, without having to sell their firstborn in order to afford health care.
The 1% smiling at the camera and telling the 99% : "we just shafted you".
Shareholders of stocks in @Depend obviously lol
what about the other millions who can't afford it? What happens to them?
Looks just like his cabinet, rich old white (except 1) billionaire men. Swamp people.
And everyone should be insured! Sickness hits the young & old it doesn't discriminate & neither should we!
@SenateGOP @GOP @GOP = DEATH TO AMERICANS! DEATH TO AMERICANS w/HORRENDOUS HEALTHCARE INSURANCE.  @GOP=DEATH TO AMERICANS!!

It's not TrumpCare, Trump doesn't care about anyone but himself. It's #LoseCare That's what it does, call it what it is! @GeorgeLakoff
Sure isn't the American people this bill is a HOT MESS just like everything else that comes from this SORRY admin; NOT GOOD
Nice cross section of America working on healthcare for all of us.
Correction: ACA redistributed wealth from hardworking taxpayers in a massive entitlement expansion. Ask who doesn't benefit
Insurance executives and the rich are the only ones who benefit. The vast majority of Americans get screwed.
nailed it.
of course. Cronyism at its best.
Nice picture of the Obamacare death panel the Rs warned everyone about.
Vote Em Out
Great picture to retweet on Women's Day
Every one of these grinning scumbags needs to
Chief of Staff Thomas Barthold simply doesn't have the answer because the CBO has not time to calculate lost revenues Jam it down!
US HAD 20 MILLION HAPPY OBAMACARE INSURED NOW WITH OUT A SECOND OPINION IT COULD SCREW THEM BECAUSE OF TRUMP
when is this disgraceful unbelievable nightmare going to stop. #Whoisgoingtobeourhero #Wethepeople
@bbhno   Perfect !!! Thank you Kamala HARRIS!!! Awesome articulation!!!!
If the GOP bill is so good I'd expect the Congress to give up their current insurance plans as well.

Looking forward to benefiting from the repeal of leftist over reach known as ACA. #TakeAHint #YouLost #ACAnext
Plz call the Trump/Ryan replacement bill #TryanCare. Keep fighting!  #SaveACA

We are the swamp, we are the filthy, we are the ones that take it all we are so slippery. From the song, "We want the world
Aaaaaand there stands that infamous "Death Panel" that the GOP claimed the ACA was beholden to.
I guess they will just have to pass the bill for those execs to find out what they are really getting, heh ??
it's incredibly revolting that ceo will be bonused. #GOP wants to be voted out. #DeathPanels #resist
instead of forcing ins  companies & GOP to fix the issues with ACA they decided to make a much worse plan.
Well, good to see there's one fat cat black male in the bunch.

Yep, that is indeed all I got.

@SenKamalaHarris @DerrickJohanna
I lost my job in the medical device field because of Obamacare.
@BJLeiderman who loses in both cases? Taxpayers.
OMG!
And, of course, the rich get richer.
@LeslieLee327 Did you call your congressman
The names of these execs should be released. We have a right 2know who wanted millions 2die so they could have a tax break.
Republicans lie so much they now don't know the difference. We do. Long live critical thinking skills!!
And stay on top Make a list if you have to!Hold EVERYONE ACCOUNTABLE!!!OUR LIVES DO DEPEND ON IT
and corrupt gop extremists who will get money from them for campaigns, at least
so wrong in so many ways!
@StopTrump2020 easy to make life changing decisions when u have HC for life! Bastards
@StopTrump2020 but who will think of the executives!? Who!?!?
@StopTrump2020 corporate greed runs America! Sad!
I really insist you call it Ryancare. Weâ€™re gonna hang this around his neck like a boat anchor.
Those poor poor men.
#whitehousesowhite
Where are the women? Under the desk?
do we know who the African-American executive in that photo works for?  I can't seem to figure out who he is?
Should be called 
#GOPDeathcare
@SenKamalaHarris
BTD-it's not Trumpcare bc DT doesn't care. GOP has complained for 8 yrs about the ACA, the "replacement" is sloppy at best. @SenKamalaHarris
all of them overpaid.  Give the American people the same health care that they are doing little man trump have
I'll say it again, get rid of their socialized healthcare, & I guarantee we'll have the best in the world.
@IAmANastyNWoman So many plp lied to when they said they fix ACA.They fix 4 fatcats&richScrew the rest
Freat, one black guy in the bunch and no women. We are so F*cked if the repeal and replace with Sh*t passes. #trumprussia
look at all the women! Support & mentor women in every work setting; we are 50% of population, challenge glass ceiling #iwd
While he & Ryan dismantle r govt we KILL poor ppl 2 profit ins execs & rich guys-SINGLE PAYER NOW
totally agree. I'm one of the 20 million. I won't have insurance under the new plan. ACA has issues, but let's fix them
Extremely this.
#ACA 

- Are republicans creating a new #evidenceBasedPolicy? 
- Refusing to wait for CBO score says absolutely not.
Disgraceful!
#Trumpdontcare
I'm TERRIFIED!
https://youtu.be/FClGhto1vIg?t=4s â€¦
Wonder what he does w the stack of papers usually on his desk
so sickening. what a shame, what an atrocity. This is not America. Let's fight this!!
@ps_from_cali new clowns!! In the same oval circus
@WaysMeansCmte uh huh. With my@money you socialist
dingbat! If they have 2 compete with each other for business, that's a win for the people!
@BIteeceeaitch
@AFLCIO the GOP plan is shit. But those same executives have benefitted greatly from ACA too
#Republicare hold them all accountable for the debacle.
@WaysMeansCmte Trickle down Trump care!  VOTE NO!
@Whits1bone there are benefits in the law that help a lot more than 20 million, Democrats need to talk about those
need to make it very clear to the American people.
#AmericaFirst but for them..Kamala please run for #Potus we love U in California! You would make a great Commander in Chief
go get 'em - the blatancy - appalling disregard for real people!
thank you for your work! and what a surprise right?..a bunch of  rich men. #SinglePayer
Considering Trump and his swampy regime, are you surprised???
