Great ...so now I can be white again without getting my head slammed or having to decide if I  use my legal fire arm?
How about civil rights for the unborn. Planned Parenthood butchers millions of babies every year and the Democrats want more. Shame shame !
Please watch some REAL INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM!! Must wake the hell up folks.   https://youtu.be/FOipBgN8IaM 
Please open urself up to REAL journalism.. do some research on the Dem party.. look at both sides and middle. Please
Please run, Ms Harris. Please @SenKamalaHarris
How about Victim's rights? How will YOU vote for #KatesLaw? How can a "no" be justified??
you're a cow!
why so hateful?
Keep up fight you are doing a great job.

#KarmalaHarris2020

What civil rights have been lost? Why do you race bait?
Please consider running in 20'! You are a shining light in these dark, dark times!
#KamalaHarris #PrideMonth #Pride2017 #ilovecalifornia
Run for president.
No need. 'All' already have civil rights. You're advocating giving 'special' rights to small groups. That's not why you were elected.
Trying to get a feel of this ; President Harris. What do you think?
Save our right to vote first! Then we can celebrate the rest! 
"Right here at City Hall."  Is this an old video? Or are you back in SF?
What about the police officer who is gay?
Fake people
You make me sick. You're an awful person. I hope you get voted out of office.  Soon.
.@SenTomCotton    2020

Thank you Senator. We never expected 45 or his cabinet of homophobes to validate us ! @riseandresistny @PhillyLGBTgov
 U!
Ma'am, this old lady would love to see you run and win. You are awesome.
I've been feeling a bit down these past few days. Your video reminded me of my own wedding in 2010. Thank You!
That's all she can do is open her pie hole
I so appreciate you in Congress. I am not from CA. But we Seattleites are with you. Keep speaking up, we got your back!
So proud to have you as our Senator.
Call it anything U want; civil right, equal rights, judicial rights, et al but, n the end, it is all human rights, the right 2 good & equal!
Thank you!!!
Do not let this Administration pass bills and laws that discriminate against others
Do not be ashamed of being gay. Pride is for and act or achievement. Being gay is not an achievement! Just be!
We need more people like you. #ShePersisted
Pride for what, those nasty men parading around half dressed in front of kids, no thx
Why don't you invest in a "clowns outfit"? It would so match up with your persona! 
Thank you, Senator!
You are awesome. Run for President.

I love you #SenKamalaHarris
Thank you for your service to all Americans. Exploring a 2020 run for the highest office in the land? #PresidentKamalaHarris sounds so good!
You are a hero in these crazy times, standing up for the American People, not the mega wealthy few.  Thanks so much.
#StillWithHer #IdB4U
We love and respect you so much. Thank you for reminding us all not to get discouraged but to  redouble our efforts for justice.

I hope you are considering running for President someday (soon).
Yes... especially the second amendment.  #2A

Love you!!! Please keep fighting for us
this twitter yo, we need captions on that video
Underneath that cutesy public image is an evil, hateful, leftist that wants to destroy your rights & steal your property NOT protect them.
I live in the UK, I wish my Member of Parliament was as passionate and committed to British people as @SenKamalaHarris is to all Americans
@SenKamalaHarris for president! 2020
Love you @SenKamalaHarris
Spoken like a strong and true leader !!

Guten Tag...

I love you so much. 
She doesn't do anything ask her about her taxes
I love this woman. She rocks.
She does!
Stand strong.  Please don't let them shut you up.
That last glass ceiling has little over 3 years left until Wonder Woman IRL, @SenKamalaHarris shatters it to smithereens.
I am so proud that you represent me!
#wethepeople know about civil rights we lived those yrS u did not&know not

Vote UR #criminal party home/prison need ppl 2work4American ppl
Things change & evolve. Lincoln was Republican. If it's possible 2 roll in the grave, he is. Since at least JFK, Democrats support equality
Thank you! 
Nothing to fight over. Laws on the books protect all Americans.
stand up to IRAN and the countries that kill gay folks,  that would be TRUE PRIDE
What happened to #MAGA? Doesn't fit you're hateful rhetoric?
I'll vote 4 u in 2020!
Same here! I hope she runs!
We are with you on civil rights for all, and support you for 2020 as a Presidential Candidate
Harris 2020!
Are you Unhinged? U mad or afraid?
Please speak with the Texas Supreme Court. They are denying our rights. Again.
Please send them this article and tell them not to lie. If they are bigots say so and do not blame God.
I agree.
Pres Harris
Pride month may be ending, but Pride itself will never die!
