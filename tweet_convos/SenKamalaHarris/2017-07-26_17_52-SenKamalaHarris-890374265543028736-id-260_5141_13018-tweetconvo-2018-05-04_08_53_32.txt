I’m asking you this – keep doing you. Keep doing what you’ve been doing because it’s working. It matters. It counts.
Let’s keep calling, let’s keep tweeting, let’s keep writing, let’s keep marching, let’s keep shouting. Let’s win.
can you at least start telling the truth and, get on Obamacare along with the 9.7 million Americans currently stuck with it?
Hang tough Senator We are counting on you
It angers me that the GOP had the arrogance to put force a bill that was tantamount to state sponsored genocide and act as if it's normal
Genocide for the 23 million without coverage so the rich can get tax cuts
what does that mean then y'all go on vacation with your fabulous healthcare and leave American's pitiful
Thank you
You are a rising star. Reach for the heavens. Keep fighting the good fight. America needs you now more than ever and in years to come.
Press on ma'am.
To the @SenateGOP do not follow the foot steps of Mitch McConnell. He sold his soul to the devil.
My regret is that the Democrats won't embrace yet universal health care.-Aka single payer. Good luck with that plan-you're going to need it!
Keeping fighting! We are with you!!!
Help the Republican Female caring Senators through these times!
#UniversalHealthCare #UHC
Make calls and fax by texting resist to 50409
Give 'em hell, Senator.
Thank you, Senator, from one of your constituents.
Thanks for being my senator.

Amen!
I've been calling, emailing, signing petitions, etc. Proud to be part of #TheResistance.
I have called and emailed countless times, haven't  received one response from any representative in my area. Can't wait to vote in 2018
With emails, you usually get generic responses. You would be lucky if anyone calls you back if you call them. Can't wait for 2018, either.
Maybe if Dems started calling ACA RomneyCare, as it was in Massachussetts, Reps would be more inclined to not repeal it.
I fully believe he still would have had a problem with it he's not going to be happy until it's called Trump care. He only cares about that.
It's unpopular with his base, and he doesn't want to be closely identified with a heavily-criticized bill. He'll claim victory anyway.
Give them hell Kamala. Fight for our rights
It's already much too late for that.
I think "President Harris" has an nice ring.
WE ARE WITH YOU, KAMALA!!!!  DON'T LET THEM PASS THIS HOT MESS, PLEASE!!!
If WH would stop cutting the life lines...
It can be fixed.
I'm so scared for so many people. 
Anything you do will be a regret. Don't act as if you care about the people
brava to you! Stay strong for america!
Stay strong!!!
Thank you @SenKamalaHarris for keeping up the fight! We I'll have no regrets! #persist #resist #SkinnyRepeal #ACA
I know I sure as Hell Don't !!
Keep up the great work!
Plz plz offer amendments that will create pos change needed 4 ACA & protect PP. demo that the Dems have ideas and can govern. Counting on U!
Always thot t'wld be wise for Congress to use ideas from Countries who have yrs of experience w/healthcare for all-w/o reinventing wheel ?
Get 'me.  Their callousness pisses me off.
Thank-you for fighting for us! Stay strong and know you are appreciated!

Thank you and please continue fighting for all of us to have affordable healthcare that actually meets our and our families' needs!
We need a hero.
Keep up the good fight! Imperial County residents need the ACA!

In that case, vote FOR the #SinglePayer amendment coming up today!!! #Medicare4All BTW I'm a constituent.
Can we have more time through a filibuster by amendment?
Entitlements are the low hanging fruit for lowdown Republicans, and it is time DEMS understand that, and plan years ahead of rotten thinking
No, this fight will be continuous until Americans can figure out a way to subsidize entitlements with outside private forex accounts!
I call @marcorubio every day..not that it will do any good, but he hears from me and I won't stop until this insanity ends!!
I don't agree with @SenKamalaHarris on much at all but she is a fierce woman and a force to be reckoned with. She is the face of the Left.
Keep fighting for us Seen Harris. 
.@SenKamalaHarris ...As we do the past six months.
I've been calling all day. Hope it helps, but I feel like republicans don't CARE about people anymore. Sad. #SaveACA #VoteNO #NeverRepeal
Keep it up. I've got a phone in each hand. Facebook and tweet them directly. We can beat this.
Let me ask as one of those horrible fascist right wingers you tolerant people want dead...what is wrong with the "skinny" plan?
That is not adequate time for the task!
Kamala For President! #GoKamala
Senator Harris, please don't let Medicaid down! People depend on that coverage!
I have ti say I am looking forward to fighting them on something else, 7 years is enough. I suspect they will resurrect this again though.
Overwhelmed by # of significant current issues (#notransban, #ScaramucciLeaks, #DOJ pick's Russian ties...) but MUST FOCUS on #healthcare

Thank you for your hard work, Senator!
Why aren't we fighting for Single Payer/Medicare for All? Why are we fighting for the Heritage Funds' ACA?
Thank you
It's sad that it even has to be a 'fight'! Us Canadians are lucky to have universal health care. We have problems too but not like yours!
Thank you & @SenFeinstein @PattyMurray @SenatorCollins basically, @ALLWOMENSENATORS
Use @botresist to fax All of your state representatives at once with one simple tweet! Flood them in faxes, share your view!
Please run for President?!
Fight until the death
Thanks to @SenJohnMcCain who could have ended this mess two days ago. #LegacyRuined
Thank you ... and please stay strong.
I am a constituent of yours in Northern California, and I want a SINGLE PAYER health care system. #SinglePayer #nowealthcare #healthisaright
Sure hope the GOP sends message to WH that bullying threatening behavior will not get bill passed. Hope sounds kinda hollow w this admin
Skinny repeal? Just enough to get tax cut that #mcconnellTurncoat DESPERATELY needs worth 22.5mil started senate 04 3mil #MEDICARE4ALL
@susanfknowles Keep calling. Email. Fax. This is our People power
Keep the ACA.
You are wonderful 
you are a true patriot!
Here is some inspiration my Grandson born with a pre-existing condition
Once this has been killed can the Dems please bring the same fervor to the issue of impeachment? It seems to be ignored by Dems.
please keep fighting we need your voice @SenKamalaHarris
I will have no regrets. 
I'm very sure that Congress will when a couple million people take to the streets. 
#StrikeForHealthcare #NoRepeal
So that means you're voting for change?
No we have at least one and a half years left in the health care fight. I don't know what the upside of pretending otherwise is.
Hang in There. We are with you. You have been doing more fighting for us than any other Senator. America needs u more than ever.
Your Not with Us either!!! #CorpWorkers #Factsmatter
You don't Support Single payer...You support Profit over ppl Too + Your Justmad, The GOP are taking over the Dems cash cow.. #HealthcareCon
No you don't. Your boss told you all to get to work and solve the problem. That means no August break! Get yo work lazya$$

Good report, Senator.  Thanks for your service.
Thank you
Everyone needs to stay on board to stop this GOP train wreck that will destroy millions of lives. Stay safe. Stay strong. TY!
Thank you! Pls fight against abolishing the mandate!
PREMIUMS going UP and COVERAGE going DOWN - how can the @GOP justify this to their base?
NEW: Premium rate shock by state under "skinny" repeal.

Hang in there, we are praying for your strength. Thank you 
@kmcbrd2 @LeonAcord Don't the Repubs get it wasn't McConnell who got them 2 D.C. & he can't save them when they r voted out of office? #DUMB
.@SenKamalaHarris To add to your comment, the fight will never end. After they dump 32 million, the definition for Republican will change
@ferreone Does it matter-I call, they know my name/address.It carries less weight than if my 6 calls were from 6 ppl, eh?
Democrats own Obamacare. As it implodes for the 2018 elections, they own it. Obstruction with no solution. Obamacare = Democratic failure.
Keep going, Ms. Harris. We appreciate your persistance!
Let's not be distracted as #45 and #GOP wants

Just go for #UniversalHealthCare
Thank you Senator Harris!
Thank you Senator Harris. We'll keep doing everything we can do & hopefully that will enable you & @SenSherrodBrown & all to win this battle
Proud to call you my Senator.  Thank you so much!
I can't #AffordObamaCare #DidntGetToKeepMyDoctor #InsuranceRatesSkyHigh won't even pay for need medication! You ought to be on #ObamaShit
Thank you for fighting for our healthcare.
#wethepeople look back at you getting into office

 but we will vote and correct this PROBLEM
Give them HELL!!!
Agreed!
Thank you for all that you are doing
Thanks for going doing a good job for a Californians! My friend AJ worked 4 u while in law school when you were a DA & speaks highly of u
She really pulls people together, wow.
what is the path to single payer? do you support it and how would you make it happen?
Set up a financial transactions tax on the banksters, or a carbon tax. Fund Medicare + lower eligibility age 5yrs every yr. Done in 13 yrs
we need to focus on regulating how the AMA sets prices which is out of hand
Thanks to you & all the @SenateDems who are standing up for Americans against these mindless, hate-driven #Repubs
Great motivational Tweets.  Keep them coming.  Say No to #TrumpCare!
Your passion and dedication won't have been in vain. Thank you for fighting the good fight.
You are amazing!! Thank you and the @SenateDems  for taking care of us.
Sad you think it is government's role to take care of you
It's the job of the strong to care for those who can't care for themselves in any sane society. Otherwise you have barbarism.
Can't is one thing...won't is another
There are so many people who would love to work but are really sick. You don't care about others at all?
If our state senators are already for Obamacare , who should we reach out to next ?
Stay strong and keep fighting for Californians and all Americans.
Thank you for your FIGHT!
My senators are on the side of right. What should I be doing as I don't have friends in at risk states?
U go run in 2020 or what?
First woman president is s Black Woman.
Sh×t Dont no sweeter than that?
Swearing in in some red bottoms.
Gangsta
Continue the fight Senator..we have your back
When you become president you can just repel everything he does we at least we have that to look forward to
That's what I keep saying. repeal the idiotic repeals.
@SenKamalaHarris for president 2020 because she cares about our lives
He knows it so he tweets the horror to the LGBT community to distract. We will stand by them. But we need to focuse in health now.
Replying to@SenKamalaHarris
Please do everything honestly and clear any skeletons, so in 2020 trump won't have anything to hang over you.
#SinglePayerNow #MedicareForAll
Thank you Senator 
Give 'em hell,Kamala.
@Aoiferocksitout LMFAO No Regrets. Keep living in that fantasy world.

Thank you, Senator, for fighting for all Americans!
Keep up the fight! We (sane) Californians are glad to have you in DC fighting for all Americans.
I know insurance companies and big pharma rule the dialogue, but universal health care please.
You Have 36 hrs Left To Kill This Bill, While The People Have Days! Keep Fighting!
HANG IN THERE, SENATOR!  We are behind you!  Thank you for representing all Americans in this fight.
Keep working! I am more and more proud of my state and you are a great representative of it.
Wish we had you!
Helped a disabled Vet login and write Lindsey Graham today. Made his day that he got his medical story submitted.  Lots of ways to help!!!
I live in Walnut Creek, CA and we must have Single Payer!
Thank you, Senator!!
Thank you I'm calling!
thank u 4 joining Sanders & Warren in the battle 4 Medicare 4 All. we need more Dems to embrace it & finally get us there.
I've been calling Hatch for months... No answer.. I saw him on tv so I know he is still alive.
I regret this entire fracas occurring.
Please keep fight back
Saw Sen.Schatz @MSNBC-he very concerned that McConnell has secret plan 2 let House version become law.Don't have 2 say how urgent to stop!
Keep fighting Senator!!
GET EM KAMALA
Are you sure you want to go into recess? Might be worth skipping to vaca to make sure Sessions stays in place.
Stay strong and focused Senator!! I appreciate all your hard work for Americans. Good luck
Thank you @SenKamalaHarris! Keep up the fight.
Love you Kamala!! Next POTUS, perhaps? #thewomanweneed #girlpower

Thank you, Senator Harris, for all you do for our country & your state.  #Patriot
Please keep fighting
Keep fighting!!!!!!
Yes please stay strong and call others to get the support , this could kill those with pre existing conditions.
That is the point to kill people
Thank you for fighting for us!
And to still refuse any Rebuttal !
Some Senator you turned out to be , , , ,
Sheesh !
Of course there are no regrets for the ACA trainwreck forced on America for 7 years.
Will you push for single payer alternative?
This might help, im serious.
Thank you so much for all you are doing! Fight on!!
We shouldn't have to beg for health insurance.

This "fight" has gotten spiteful and mean.

This is not the America I know...
We can barely be civil to one another. I know I have to work at it.
I watched @alfranken Alfranon C-span tonight he hit the nail on the head!
36 hours? Pshhh...America regrets the last 6 months.
I think Russia does too.
Thanks for fighting for Texans!!!
We got your back!
Please run for president
