What about Latinas and other women of color? Is this fight only for "black" women?
When you can specifically tell Americans how government can enforce wage equality in a free market with diverse interests; get back to us.
Kamala your a late train on this Ivonka has this covered please contact her if you would like to help her & Mr Trump they have been helping
I am sure Kamala if you really want to help women Ivonka would welcome your in biased input into how to help all women get better pay & jobs
"It's IVANKA, not IVONKA, and UNBIASED, not in biased. RIF=READING IS FUNDAMENTAL!"

Yes he blocked an English teacher
What do you propose?
She's just rotely mouthing progressive ideals and mantras to advance her career and build clout for a 2020 run. Canned messaging.
I agree. She (or whomever tweets for her) has been churning them out A LOT.
Exactly. The tone is just so unauthentic and contrived. Her account has definitely had the feel of a bot account for the last few months.
It's like the DNC took it over or something 
Kamala Harris is a fraud. She let all the wall st criminals off the hook! No more house negro dem candidates. Go away Kamala..
Interesting how you don't give a damn about women from any race, just your own. #AmericanIndianWomenThinkALLWOMENare Valuable #RacistMuch
She only cares for her select few not all people. We the People have voices, take a STAND, they work for US
When #BlackWomensEqualPay finally arrives, will you let bankers steal our equity by illegally foreclosing on our homes, like you did Mnuchin
YES!!!!!! Thank you, @SenKamalaHarris!!
This has been a large thorn in many hands and arms for decades. God has the power to remove NOT MAN we forget this at times smile.
But you were not interested in Muslim women's problems when you sat on committee about them. Not even one question. Disappointed in you.
#BlackWomensEqualPay Everyday!

Obama had 8 yrs to fix this & failed
#MAGA #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
We need restorative justice and legal weed
Just gender would be a start.
Or let us focus on women, in general.
Do you have a clue about how the financial establishment works.
I already have it's education and self-reliance.
Yes and it's called get an effing job pull your big boy or girl pants up and stop whining no matter what your color or gender is
I am a black women and a senior that have wrote to share my feelings and outlooks in hjealthy eating for the elderly for YEARS
"Intersectionality" promotes poverty.  Opportunity for ALL promotes shared wealth.
Especially because it keeps your supporters distracted to your hypocrisy
You have a great chance to take the initiative in congress. You are an important contender for 2020. 
And gender and disability!! Please understand that there is discrimination for white women too!
Race baiting Kamala should be saying all women, not just black women. Pathetic racist!
#RunKamalaHarrisRun
Start by explaining to them how you take their money, babies, housing and offer no jobs. I'll wait.
You will be waiting forever.She cares nothing for the American citizens only her select few and party 
Oh I know. She is cut from the same cloth. Evil and waste money
Very True
You know dat puddintang has a shelf life and as it age you cant compete with the young hoes. Is that what you sayin?
Thank you for highlighting the role of intersectionality in politics!
and you are what the rabid left is talking about running for President? LOL Please bring this nut leftism identity politics as your platform
Your party has been saying that for decades and blacks are still living in rat infested ghettos and crime ridden neighborhoods. Lies 4 votes
Poverty in the US for majority is a choice. Do the right things and you have less than 10% chance to live in poverty.
You keep pointing out problems. I can too politicians don't fix problems they just make more to distract from the ones they don't fix.
it would b a shame if u were to represent all people, like u were elected to do.
Yes when it involves Black women white females always talk about the glass ceiling but it practically CONCRETE for Black women
Funny when Democrats drop all these issues without ANY solutions. 
Don't worry, the Trump Team will resolve them all. Democrats are no help
This starts with equitable school funding and support for debt free college #PublicschoolProud
We can start by electing more politicians who are interested in changing the status quo, not in keeping it
#TheSociopathicBusinessModel found EACH discriminatory class (#sexism & #racism) FURTHER DECREASES pay in relation to white males.
Not with this White House.  Because it's stuck on stupid.
There's a lot of truth in that statement.
Then how about less hearings about Russia?
I agree. Especially those with more than one child. I'm talking better training,  entrepreneurships and real contracts
#1 way to stay out of poverty, finish hs #2 don't have kinds without fathers
Hi
Think this is what @HillaryClinton tried to run on, your sexist, anti-male, race baiting.  Ask her WHAT HAPPENED?  
p.s. she lost
#Trump2020
Nope. We need INDIVIDUALS to make better decisions planning their own lives and futures regardless of their race and gender.

Really simple.
Please!
You'd have better results addressing the pervasive "bady daddy" culture which plagues the black community.
Really surprising. In this age & time
It is about LIFE CHOICES, not because of evil white racist misogynists. YOU ARE NOT A VICTIM. #BlackWomensEqualPay
Equalpay for equal work, socialism doesn't work no one is equal to anyone else because no 2 ppl r the same
So you're a communist?
Exactly why economic Bernie-speak is meaningless without equal rights/equal pay activism backing it up.
Sounds like USSR 1962. Good luck with backward thinking.

Cheers
Why wasn't this addressed over the past 8 years???  Somehow now Trumps problem...
It only strengthens us as a society when we value all citizens and treat everyone equitably.  #EqualPay #BlackWomensEqualPay
Based on these flailing replies, it appears the Russian trolls and Breitbart readers have seen polls showing you would do well in 2020.
We need to address the injustice taxpayers receive from the lying liberal democrats
I can only speak from my 38yrs in the workforce. I have not experienced this injustice. I have a female boss and female Pres of the company.
Until black women and community operate in concert to vote people into office who will implement those changes nothing will change.#surprise
But there is no Gender Wage gap and you get treated equally.
Learn basic economics Ms Harris. Then come back...
That would too "Right ON"
How about the economic injustice of a decimated middle class?Or a political system that only really cares about donors and not constituents?
The problem is not all skill levels are equal. We all have different interests, aptitudes, education, and skills. We make different choices.
Trump is about to put you and all your colleagues on Obamacare, I'd worry about that if I were you.
what injustice
YES! #BlackWomensEqualPay
We agree that you need to do more in general
You are overpaid.
Wish I made as much as Black Women...that extra dime looks good. #equalpayforall #LatinasMatterToo  #BlackWomensEqualPay

And yet everyone in Congress makes more $$$$ than black women working in public schools, healthcare and childcare.  #BlackWomensEqualPay
You keep avoiding Single Payer? Why? The country is behind it.
ZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.
"Economic injustice"
Can I get a refund for all my tax payer money that gets used to fund the black unwed mothers?
Inot saying that African women do not suffer inequality in many aspects of their lives. But movements like this leave out other minorities.
Indians, native Americans, orientals from Koreans to Chinese to Japanese, Aborigines, etc...
You do a lot of "we need to", but actually do very little.
Equal pay for equal work is a gender issue, not a racial one. It affects White women too.
Got your work cut out 4 U. Why can't citizens enjoy the same health coverage as U & your colleagues?  We pay 4 it. Think economy of scales.
economic justice? wtf are you talking about? taking care of the lazy shit who wont work. go pound sand ....
I have no respect for people incapable of compassion or learning. Blocked.
Side note: Can you plsetalk to the white men in charge of our party abt how they keep trying to throw our reproductive right under the bus?
Agreed. But Idea is the place where change must occur.  Then justice will descend like soft snow.
What's your position on the new DCCC policy of allowing party funds to help anti-abortion candidates, Senator?
Go Get em Kamala!   Our ladies are kicking butt and taking names!   Women rule!  No one is equal until we are all equal!
We need to clean the garbage out of Washington that means Trump his administration & most of the GOP
Identity politics, I see
please address the gap between white males and Asians...#racism
12:27pm CT , 12:27pm CT  4mins ago  being for your 2nd tweet (notification) TRUTHFULLY, Sen. Kamala Harris,  The Senate is in Sesiion today!
Edit: my spelling (session) also the time repeateded, TRUTHFULLY,  Watching @CNN  @Wolfblitzer  now.  MY mind .THINK PLEASE!
. More capital for start ups, less regs, address state equal pay laws.
Sry Senator stop talking about WE, its YOUR job to fix it! This is politician speech!
In much that I read from the US, the importance is "difference". Colour, gender, origin, party, etc. These actually can be "invisible".
If I could read an account that did not say white, black, male, trans, female, etc it would not be important. It IS not that important.!
It seems simple. Job pays X amount. Applicant meets or exceeds requirements. Hired. Done. See you on Monday. Regardless Sex, Race, or Age.
@ManuelSillas54 also senator Hispanic the most hard working people, in our nation, a large.number working so hard, for minimum wage

Black women are the most educated group in the US but still held back in terms of pay and promotions
I agree with almost everything you say.
Sen Harris.  2020
Then work with the right and find common ground on capitalism less regulations and most of all TAX Cuts for business owners #RocketScience
Lol
Pay equality IS equality.
First you need to get people to admit there's a problem.  #denial #institutionalizedracism #institutionalizedsexism
Unrelated... Can you explain why you don't support body cams for police?
