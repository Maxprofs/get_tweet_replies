The election is over, so that doesn't matter anymore. Why do you think that justifies supporting Trump's dangerous actions?
Because I firmly, 100% agree that he is better for us than she could ever be. #SCOTUS
There were better candidates than him on BOTH sides, you could have supported them. Now his actions r indefensibly harmful.
No.  Besides, they didn't have a snowballs chance in hell.
thank you for your NO vote!
the EPA legacy under obama. The Colorado river.
and the mining companies that neglected the storage of that sludge takes no responsibility?
they should have been responsible for the cleanup. Government took charge and caused the mess.
those things were at the point of bursting any moment.
You rock @SenKamalaHarris -for pulling an all nighter in an effort to stop #pollutingPruitt  #ShePersisted
Thank you Senator for standing up for our country our people &the planet we all share with other nations & their citizens!
Protecting the environment is a good thing but over regulation and misuse of power are not.
Well us something we don't know Genius?
It's scary when our children are smarter than our President and GOP Congress.
Yeah I'm sure a 7 year is super concerned about Global Warming & stuff
Don't worry June. I will fight for you and my 7 year old son.
thank you! Glad we can count on you.
Does #ScrewItPruitt #pollutingPruitt want humans to be the last species on earth? #animalextinctions #dyingreefs
Thank you for opposing Pruitt
You seem to be my representative. Personally I hope Mr Pruitt will stop the EPA from breaking the law and defying judges.
June seems to have a better sense of things at an early age. I think we should lower the voting age to 7
Thank you for voting vs Pruitt. Unfortunately my Georgia Senators @sendavidperdue & @SenatorIsakson don't care about kids.
@Matt75125563 So next time you travel DC i guess you will be walking...save the planet and walk.
great to see you taking advices from a 7 year old. Definitely great #PR for an #emotional crowd!
Thank you Senator from Philly

This is proveably false.
Everything will be fine. It's long past time to reign in the out of control @EPA.
Yeah who needs clean water and air?
I hope you told this so-called kid that global warming is a hoax. @SenKamalaHarris #globalwarming
Thank you for voting no, even if the Republicans rammed him through.

Thanks for standing up for NO on Pruitt.  Keep rejecting bad guys hug
thank you.
I'm really glad that at least my state of California has an amazing Senator representing us!
why didn't 2 vote from #indiana & @SenJohnMcCain ??? Against #PruittVote
why on Gods green earth would you subject any 7 yr old to such an outrageous scam to fill your pockets? Outrageous! Smh
It's such a shame that Republicans don't care about the condition of the planet we will pass on to our children & grandkids
thank you.
Thanks for voting "no" on Scott Pruitt. Unfortunately the Senate confirmed him to run the EPA. God help us all!
Nice to be worried about environment.  But meanwhile we have an ignorant wacko in WH.  No 1 priority - get him out ASAP.
Thank you @SenKamalaHarris
Ms Harris thank you, the Artic was 30 degress above norms, holocene extinction what kind of world are we leaving children?
You also turned your back on Prop 215 patients you were supposed to protect while California Attorney General.  @MAK7591
But, but...muh ice caps!!

Thank you Senator. Wishing that those who did vote for him has been as bright as June.

Thank you, Senator!
Your voice is so very important now Senator - 2020 is just around the corner, and Trump has already filed to run again.
The MONOPOLY has used HAARP to heat the Arctic,

guess what happened.
MORE ICE THAN EVER.......!
global warming is fake and we all know it!
Our grandchildren will  choke to death in pollution and he and his cronies will profit from their deaths.
.@SenKamalaHarris #AnimasRiver #FlintWaterCrisis #OrovilleDam... if only there was an Agency for the Protection of the Environment.
Children will not forget @realDonaldTrump and @SenateGOP attempted to destroy the environment and education.
Good job. You have spent a lot of time obstructing the new cabinet and failed.
But yet he was confirmed. Come back from the loony left or start liking losing.
Stop propagandizing kids and stuff
You need to figure out how to work with republicans and stop this madness. You can't get votes if we can't breathe!
Thank you for taking a stand.
thank you for your vote against Pruitt!
It was not unanimous. Dems arr not united. Shame on @Sen_JoeManchin @SenatorHeitkamp do your job!
We ALL know the environment is over taxed. There is a Scientist March occurring this March.  Go in support of it. Ciao Uno
w/respect Ma'am. With kindness, I ask you: refrain from propaganda in name of a child. Use an adult argument or step back.
You are right in opposition...GOP will pay!
How much do we discount the value of a habitable planet for her generation and the ones thereafter?
when propaganda seeps into our children
Thank you.  We need more people like you in the Senate.
Thank you for your efforts Senator Harris. Never, never give up the fight for our environment, our values, our democracy.
thanks for voting .. we need more bipartisan efforts to protect our country on every issue
thank you. Too bad the GOP wants to dismantle the protections that keep us safe from toxic pollutions.
Thank you Senator Harris...environment can stand 4 yrs of Pruitt but not 8!
kids like June will suffer more from climate change & pollution than Pruitt & his oil industry buddies #pollutingPruitt
climate change is a hoax and June is brainwashed
@MimiLeroch recently read a story about bringing back extinct mammoth. We won't save the ones still here
As an environmental scientist, I appreciate your vote.
BTW, I did my MS research not far from the site in your banner photo.  Nice!
of course you did ....it's what the special interest told you to do if you want to get paid
You're joking, right? Like republicans aren't bought by Big oil. Green energy has a pathetic lobby in comparison
thank you    Now how do we get ahead of the next issue? Which dems buckled under the pressure?
Thank you!
Thanks for your efforts.
Please vote NO on David Friedman nomination for US Ambassador to Israel and his dangerous agenda.
Thank you. Its because of people like you "we the people " don't feel so alone.
Thank you. So distressing to see what our nation is becoming...and there's nothing we can do (until 2018).
good job Senator
yet, alas, he just got confirmed. 
Thank you, Senator.
why don't republicans?
thanks for voting against another horrible choice for cabinet position. The @potus admin is truly a Team of Deplorables!
thank you for standing your ground unlike those other fake democrats. Sad when a democrat voted yes to destroy our earth.
Dems have no teeth
dont ever stray from your beliefs! The future needs your voice!
@JonathanCohn Are the emails still going to be released???

Thanks 4 a NO vote!
Thank you.
