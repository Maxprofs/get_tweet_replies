@Kris_Sacrebleu @GOP should get #TalkingPoints in order. How bout, "We don't give a damn about the poor, they don't donate"
Why N The "HELL" Didn't OBAMA leave R Healthcare Alone
He Just FLOCKED Everything Up
Ave % incr in 5 yrs since OC LT 5 yr ave B4. Mils more ins. No pre-exist cond & kids to 25
YES, Some people hit harder but overall better & covers needy like your buddy JC preached
Thanks @USARedOrchestra for chart
@SenateDems millions lost their healthcare Insr do to ACA. And now they r fined for not having it. Talk about costing more.
Ok, but this new plan still SUCKS!! Explain that before trying to deflect the issue.
Paul Ryan at the end -"doesn't care - only cares that he repealed Obamacare."
.@SenKamalaHarris wait a minute...
More expensive.
Less coverage.
Fewer people with coverage.
Millionaires get a tax cut.
Sounds perfect!!!
Sadly those ppl needing this the most could now go without. Everyone is entitled to health care. Everyone!
@228Years @CNN @amjoyshow This is your GOP party on healthcare. They know millions will lose healthcare & they don't care.
@SenateDems Im waiting for an explanation on why Obamacare killed my great h/c just so illegals can have it free? Anyone?
It's not about the ACA. It's about the tax cuts, Insurance lobby, etc.
Dont you mean POLITICIANS DONT GIVE A CRAP ABOUT  AMERICANS HEALTHCARE? Thought so! MAGAMAGAMAGA
@LanceBass I have an IPhone and health insurance. 
keep up the good work. That's why I voted for you!
@jeconboy : fight them; this is an existential issue for the national health of millions. Thank you for being there!
U R mis-informed.OC was un-usable by many because of the high prems/deduct. More will benefit & hv good coverg
@sbuchbinder How about Congress get their health care at VA Hospitals until they understand the importance of Health Care!
Congress is afraid to use the VA.
@TyroneGayle If they were to pass this mess what happens when their voters start losing their coverage? Start paying more?
Many of us r already paying more 4 less. Obamacare is imploding now-it's not affordable.
@spankerella it's called trumpdon'tcare
blah blah listen to you
And Ryan flat out saying he doesn't care. Blaming it on the American public. So he doesn't care about the impact. Awful!
PLEASE @potus Just let Obama care go & fall. NO MORE MONEY put into a failing program. Let idiots have it
@Twitlertwit  My daughter, Annie McKee has Crohn's Disease!  Healthcare is a life or death choice for her not a luxury!
Decent health care is not a privilege...it is a right. That is the eventual goal for all of us.
@SenateDems Republicans can't show you a Country where the Free Market Healthcare Works! They Lie about Universal HC
@SenateDems I never thought I would ask Democrats for anything. But, put this GOPCare bill out of our misery and bury it!
Rep. Lance had no idea how many ppl in his district were covered under ACA.  He said 5,000, but it is 20,000. A problem.
it must be simple for you to  provide the Dems explanation to the millions losing healthcare under the ACA in 2018.
@SenateDems Wiki/tweets can't cover (Russian ties) lunatic & putin (with tillerson silent) WILL go 2 nuke cloud 2 distract
@SenateDems  Greedy GOP paid by 1%ers  worship money & trump their me$$iah  putin and tillerson is new $ource  Unreal
@SenateDems trump bit off more than he can chew.
Yup. All those who got massive subsidies are going to have to become responsible for their own well being.
please use #trumpdeathcare to say trumpcare implies he cares when he doesn't
@SenateDems I'm glad to see Dems using the word "TrumpCare" in your tweets. Let's see if Trump has the balls to own it.
@SenateDems why don't you watch Mr. Ryan's explaination of the new health Bill from his news conference he made it very clr
duh fuck...
???
.@SenKamalaHarris .@SpeakerRyan Is not that concerned about giving the rich tax cuts at the expense of millions who will not have health ins
@SenateDems You have to pass it too see what's in it.
@SenateDems why would they want to take away healthcare from Americans. Hard working, tax paying Americans , why?
@HanffJean Multitask! Focus #trumprussia first! #SaveACA
no! Block one black female owner!. U are frauds! Forbidden practices. California laws of migrant trafficking©®™
they do not care.
No health care = murder
- this is sickening. Where can I find this video so I can share it with EVERYONE I know via social media. Do u know?
@SenateDems  They should tell the truth-they are crooks and hoars.
please stop this travesty
how can they keep a straight face in interviews or meeting w/ constituents @ town halls. Ah yes, they no longer hold those.
@SenateDems wow, your so out in left field like the rest of u Demoncrat haters. Wouldn't go out in a lightening storm!
@SenateDems #Trumpcare #SoylentGreen
Paul Ryan can gohis arrogant old self.
Yeah, hard to explain how "we" Republicans, just want more of your money.
I feel like we are all being held hostage by the insurance carriers.
@SenateDems  Nonsense.
Great post.
He's not concerned about it, the rich getting more tax breaks.
That sums it all up people.  The GOP attitude.
Because reasons?
Republican puppets will support Trumpcare
DonTCare
So wish someone would smack that shit eating grin off of Ryans face. He is such a loser!
so Paul Ryan is not concerned about sending more money to the wealthy while fleecing average and poor Americans
@SenateDems ? Not asked, why didn't u R's work with D's to fix probs? All they did was obstruct. They could have fixed.
@SenateDems @POTUS @GOP just said the new health care is not about health care?  But it is about choices?  Oh I see choice
1. Do I want to eat or see a doctor?  2. Do I want to eat or get my prescriptions?  3,  Do I want
to go to live or do I want to for.  Hmmm.....seems to me the the GOP is saying if you die then we
don't have to deal with you.  If you can't afford health insurance the GOP are saying well too bad
for you because we don't care.  And we elected these people?  Who is with me if we lose health care
then the GOP should lose their jobs along with the President.   If you prefer not to have health
then that should be up to you but this plan does not say that.
Smokin' mirrors That's what #Trumpcare really is.
@SenateDems who would have thought health care could be so complicated?
What explanation is needed for insanity? Crazy is as crazy does. Crazy talk is icing on the crazy cake.
You are mistaken!

#Obamacarelite
...they cant explain any benefit 2the program because there R none ..it's all about Trump power/ego obsession against Obama
having trouble? How about ducking town halls so they don't have to.
the new Health I puts premiums out of reach 4 many middle class workers. they will opt 2 stop working & get free medicaid.
Don't call it "care", it's "TrumpNeglect" 
WTF Punk Ryan doesnt care about the $ being given 2rich..all he cares about is repealing"Obamacare"..That's Trump speaking!
Trumpcare
Trumpcare
Trumpcare
what an ass that Paul Ryan is.
@GOP @SpeakerRyan I think one thing you are ignoring is that your not so rich constituents wanted Obamacare termed not ACA!
lol
my self &my autistic son will lose coverage if #Trumpcare passes.I'm frightened becauseson needs his meds 4 mood disorder
What's shocking to me is the GOP reaction to the TrumpCare draft and thinking it's not extreme enough.  Wow.
They certainly are pushing it through fast. Usually means Americana's are screwed again
Even Tucker Carlson is skeptical. @SpeakerRyan "isn't all that concerned", good to know about his apathy towards lower income taxpayers.
Hope his constituents aren't all that concerned with his loss of healthcare when loses next time.
Not that Republicans care.
#HealthcareCEOCare
Please keep calling it #TrumpCare. This is all on him.
He promised something better!
