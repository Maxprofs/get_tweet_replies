Gotta make hay for those donors!
you suck
Did that include new GOLF clubs for your leader. TRUMPUS
Trump’s Treasury secretary Mnuchin admits in bankers meeting their proposed tax cut ‘disproportionately helps rich people.’ @nowthisnews
How does this help your kansas constituents @JerryMoran ??
No! You're irresponsibly growing the deficit to give tax cuts to ultra-wealthy who won't spend their windfall to grow economy. #NotOnePenny
KS Sen. Sykes, op-ed in WaPo calling on national R's to learn from KS tax disaster.

#TaxReform
Fun Fact: 0.5% of Kansan's make more than $1 million per year but they will get 52.6% of taxcut, averaging $143,000 savings (5.7% reduction)
Koch puppet
Jerry “Koch” Moran
Thanks for nothing.
We won’t forget this Jerry.
Why are you willing to cut my Medicare and social security for the sake of the ultra rich. That is disgraceful.
80% of Trump’s tax cuts would go to the top 1% – and this senator isn’t having it. 
@nowthisnews @SenWhitehouse
Cutting Medicaid by $1T & Medicare by $470B is trickle down harm to the most vulnerable Kansans. 
BUT Cut taxes for top 1% tho!
40% goes to the top 0.1%. 80% goes to the top 1%.  The other 99% get 20% BUT they do get cuts to the healthcare safety net they rely on.
It looks the same as what Kansas had for the last 4 years and you know it hasn't worked. Not understanding why you would consider this vote?
Bad vote
Bad senator...
Have you voted on #CHIP or are children not really that important?
Thanks again for putting party over country. I continually hope for you to put Kansans first and am disappointed every time. You saw what plans like this did to KS and now you want to do it to the country...why?!?
Disappointed to see your support for these Trump Tax Cuts. Sad to see you buying into these debunked voodoo economics. #KansansKnowBetter
This is not for American Families.  It is for the top 1%, very few of whom are Kansans other than the Koch brothers. #DoYourJob
Top 1% in Kansas can expect $84,190 tax cut. Average working middle class  Kansas tax payer might actually owe more. https://itep.org/trumpgopplanks/ 
Are you really bragging about cutting Medicaid, cutting Medicare???  By $$$$$ ,so you can give the Koch Bros another tax cut?
You should be ashamed 
Why do we bother calling you, you don’t represent us. I will work to get you out of office.
What r the specifics of tax reform?  How much r u adding 2 deficit?
This explodes the deficit. The estate "death" tax only impacts people who inherit over 10 million so how is this not more breaks for top 1%?
Plutocracy on its way. The rich will get richer “beyond the dreams of avarice.”
See you sold the majority of Kansans down the river again.
Reform to what purpose? Reform to cripple us further? What do you get in exchange for that damage to us?
This budget sets the stage for huge cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. A "fair" and "simple" tax code should not harm your constituents.
We all know 'fair' & 'simple' are market-tested words to fool stupid people. Kansans aren't going to keep falling for this crap, Jerry!
What a horrible thing to do. You are suppose to represent Kansas not the 1%
Reagonomics didn't work either.  Let's talk about the definition of insanity...
Nightmare
Which saddens me deeply as a citizen of a failed tax policy in KS
Very sad future. I'd expect that you learn frm experience abt "tax reform" as a Kansan;& don't say states are different--BB didn't think so.
The Koch bros thank you
This budget will harm the majority of Kansans. We know Lafler’s plan is no good. Businesses grow because of demand, not tax breaks. #ksleg
What gibberish. Did you think this comment makes sense?  Get a clue- this is a necessary predicate to critical policy changes!

Proving again how you don't have a conscience. Despicable. Your constituents including myself won't forget it.
So Jerry, you're ok will stealing from the poor to give to the rich?  Perhaps you need another profession. How abt being a lawyer?
For tax giveaway to pay for itself every $1 of taxcuts would need to produce $5 to $6 of new GDP growth http://www.crfb.org/papers/tax-cuts-dont-pay-themselves … @BudgetHawks
So you're real proud of this, but do you have any thoughts as to how this 21 trillion dollar debt will be paid?
Since 2012 Kansas budget has proven tax cuts never ever never pay for themselves. This budget busting tax giveaway is not for KS middleclass
You are an archaic man, lost in an old school man mentality. You think you can keep your game going with smart Kansians? We see you.
In order to pay for itself every $1 of taxcuts would need 2 produce $5 to $6 of added economic activity http://www.crfb.org/papers/tax-cuts-dont-pay-themselves … @BudgetHawks
Senate budget plan increases deficit $1.5 trillion (not including interest), $473 billion in cuts to Medicare & $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts
Hasn't your corporate welfare done enough to damage Kansas? Do you understand you're elected by the people to represent their BEST interests
Jerry, why do you feel working class families should have to pay even more so the rich can have additional tax cuts?
Why do you hate poor people so much?
Nonpartisan federal budget estimate of Big-6 Tax Framework will add $2.7 trillion to deficit w/interest http://www.crfb.org/blogs/big-6-tax-framework-could-cost-22-trillion … @BudgetHawks
Once, again, you have let your constituents down.  The failed trickle-down ruined Kansas. Medicaid and Medicare cuts are horrible.
Senator @JerryMoran - I agree with nearly 100% of respondents that this is bad policy.  As a Kansan you should know.
Please tell me it's not the one Trump's pushing?
Analysis by nonpartisan budget wonks @iteptweets shows 12.8% of Kansas middle income families will owe $1050 more.
https://itep.org/trumpgopplanks/ 
80% going to the top 1% IS helping American Families but I see you left out "middle class" and "working" from your statement. Not a mistake
Kansas remembers your votes to try to take away healthcare from millions of people. We’ll also remember this vote to give tax cuts to the rich, too.
Top 1% in Kansas can expect a 4.6% reduction in taxes paid. Middle class reduction is about 0.9% (less than 1%).
https://itep.org/trumpgopplanks/ 
58.3% of Senate proposed tax cut goes to top 1% in Kansas. This does not benefit middle class. https://itep.org/trumpgopplanks/ 
Senator we know you are selling out Kansans to the Koch brothers and @realDonaldTrump Don't leave a legacy of graft like @PatRoberts
Shocking, that you don’t listen to the majority of your constituents. #voteNO
Sen Moran, Why aren't U bringing up S. 18 the FairTax Act in Senate?  Did you sponsor S. 18 for show? @fairtaxofficial
This is the first time in a while I have been disappointed with your decision. Simple and fair could be done without wealthy tax breaks.
You simply don't care about Kansans.  You are setting most of us up for pain and suffering. Heartbroken you can be so callous.
but it's all about the party right Jerry?  The "win" above all else.  People's lives and hardships don't matter.  GOP above all else.
Tax reform for the wealthy only isn't tax reform. Call it for what it is... "Welfare For The Rich".
Don't you mean you paved the way to screw your constituents with cuts to Medicare and Social Security to pandering to your pimps - the 1%.
please don't
I'm in the middle class in KS Jerry. How is cutting tax deductions for us, cutting Medicare, cutting Medicaid going to help me? Waiting.
I wish I had called you to let you know I don't support it. I'll need to do more and remember that important changes continually happen
He wouldn’t have cared. His staff would haves pretended to hear your concerns but in the end he still would have just done masters’ bidding
You are doing great harm to your constituents. You should not be bragging about this. Only Koch bros like your vote. You screwed us over
You know this won't work. You just exploded the deficit and gave tax cuts to your rich buddies...this is a @GOP nightmare. AGAIN.
.It’s funny Senator, but I don’t see any mention in your statement about cuts to Medicare & Medicaid in your statement. Perhaps you can elaborate? Here’s what I am reading:
@Koch_Industries and their dark money subsidiaries are elated I’m sure.
This budget has serious flaws such as lack of debt control. Since we can’t depend on the kind of growth we need to control it, how will we?
Please stop ruining our country.  Do us all a favor and resign.
Thanks for nothing.
Your father was right about you. You are nothing.
