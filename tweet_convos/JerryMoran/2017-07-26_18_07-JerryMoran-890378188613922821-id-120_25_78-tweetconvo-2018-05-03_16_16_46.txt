Oh please. He's being given the green light to be bigoted and prejudicial about any religion except his own. Another embatrasment by Trump
Unless you're a person of color, a woman, poor, or queer...so most of Kansas's persecuted populations
Or 90% of people not Koch elbow rubbers. Brownback sucks. He is that evangelical prosperity preaching "Christian" who is backed by CNP types
They love wielding religion as a weapon to subdue and make the brainwashed masses obedient to their power and money grabs. It is fake piety.
Oh shut up.
So the disabled and seniors are not part of the”persecuted”?
Ambassador for International  Religious Freedom...as long as you're Christian.
This 1000 times!! Horrible man.
Christian Nationalism
Riiiiight...." fighter for the persecuted". 
You clearly understand nothing about our state anymore. #VoteMoranOut
Kansas is absolutely screwed. There is little light ahead for it's citizens and you helped to bring us here. #MoranOut
At some point and time. All of you will have to realize you are out of touch with a significant portion of Kansas citizens.
25:4 TRUMP NO MORE!
He's run our beautiful state into the ditch with his asinine tax programs...  At least he won't be hurting the hard working KS taxpayers...
Are you high? Fighter for the persecuted?? I want whatever it is you are smoking. It will make living w/ this admistration a lot easier.
And he put Kansas' budget in the crapper. But he's good with Jesus so......ya.
Jesus would slap him upside the head for abusing his name for raping the economy of flesh and blood people for big monied interests.
Had no idea that the wealthy, small business owning Christian Kansans have been persecuted.

Ever
You can't have an idea, because your brain don't work, just like your Commaner n' tweet
LIAR.
For the persecuted? What? He fought for white, rich people and that is all.
I guess that means more Muslim immigrants
Correction: Brownback has long been a fighter for the privileged, conservative Christian demographic. He hung the rest of us out to dry.
Brownback doesn't care about anyone but the wealthy.
He will do even more destruction to our country like he did in KS. Sorry US for another fanatic from KS.
I agree with u!
Brownback cut off their life-line by denying Medicaid benefits: actually persecutes the persecuted !!!
Thank you president Trump for electing him. Where is your thanks Moran?
Why would you lie about that?

UPDATE FOR CALLS: skinny now includes "1332 waivers." DC speak for letting states waive essential health benefits. Aka insurance gets worse. https://twitter.com/caitlinnowens/status/890595703885635584 …
Please provide specific examples of of him fighting for the persecuted?  I have a hard time thinking of any.
I moved here from Texas 17 years ago and was impressed by the social programs. After Brownback, programs were defended under this RWNJ!
Funds were cut for the vulnerable. It looked more like Texas that had 500 child abuse cases per one social worker. Education underfunded too
Honor separation of church & state
Not 1 tweet in this thread is in support of brownback including this one. Screams volumes. 
He is a CNP hack. He wants a Christian nation, which is against the founders wishes. He has a fundamentalist extremist vision.
You go with him, Pat. You are a FAILURE at representing Kansas. You don't even live here. Just GET OUT!!
Aaaaaaand any remaining credibility now gone.

He's been a horrible Governor. Hands down the worst in the nation. Remember the separation of church and state? The founders weren't fools.
He trashed our state! Worst gov in our history. Totally incompetent. Private religion can't play a part in public politics. Good riddance!
.@govsambrownback has long been a fighter for persecution - will be tireless in attacking international religious freedom #fixedit4u
This man has bankrupted Kansas.
I hope this was sarcasm. Because no he hasn't and no he won't.
Really? I'm going to need some evidence. I'm not trying to be a troll here. I'm actually curious about what you're referencing.
I met @govsambrownback when the US senator urged divestment away from Fidelity due to Blood Diamonds. So 2007-ish? That's my only example.
That's something, I suppose.
Anything to get him out of Kansas.
C'mon now. Don't make up fake news. Brownback is a selfish greedy man who has wrecked Kansas and is now leaving us for dead.

Sam Brownback has been a fighter for the Koch brothers and has destroyed Kansas.
Come on Jerry, call it like it is, the majority of Kansas are cheering the fact Brownback will be gone from the state.
Not believing it. Is that why he sold the whole state down the river and now abandons ship?
The only good thing about Brownback being an ambassador is he can't destroy Kansas any further.
Please ask Sam if the money he borrowed from KPERS will be paid back before he leaves Kansas.
1. This is an absolute lie. As an Atheist, empathetic Kansan, I demand that you represent all of us. No more sycophantic tendencies! Vote NO
2. on repeal without replace. Introduce single payer and do the right thing for Kansas AND America. Equality and healthcare for ALL.
Freedom to discriminate in any circumstance. Zzz..
... and he has blood on his hands for his corrupt foster care system
I can't even. Omg wake up! He persecuted the gays!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm done. No one can tell me you're a good guy
How can I miss you when you won't go away; here's your hat what's your hurry; pls let door of KS hit your a** on the way out ...
Denying citizens access to affordable healthcare is a form of persecution.
@JerryMoran #MoranOut @patroberts @SenPatRoberts #RobertsOut #Kansas #healthcare #HealthCareVote #ACARepealDebate
Really?? What Sam Brownback do you know? Because the one here has run the state into the ground. Good riddance!
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah ha hey hey hey goodbye!!!! Sing it with me free staters!!!
Jerry had to tweet this. Obligatory back-patting of fellow Repub. I hope Moran privately feels relief like the rest of us.
Spoken like a true religious zealot
Brownback? A fighter for the persecuted?! This is easily the dumbest thing I've read today, including like five Trump tweets. Remarkable.
@JerryMoran #MoranOut @patroberts @SenPatRoberts #RobertsOut #Kansas #healthcare #HealthCareVote #ACARepealDebate
Please tell me we will not be continuing to pay his salary....Senator Moran, your comments again prove how out of touch you are
"has long been a fighter for the persecuted--"

Imma stop you right there
Jerry, don't defend Sam--it shows you don't realize how much Kansans hated him. He was a fiasco. If you don't learn from it, you'll be next.
If he hadn't destroyed Kansas I might think this is funny. We are all better off without him, good riddance.
Glad he is movin' on
No. Just no. I worked for the state under his administration. Absolutely the worst for people. They said the taxpayers were a commodity.
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare #BCRA #AHCA #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
POINT 7: CBO lays blame for the insurer exit largely with Trump.   In fact... 12 
skinny repeal:

20% Premium Hikes
16 Million Lose Their Health Care (14M by 2018)

VOTE NO
Bye, Bye Sam!! #GoodRiddance
Why look abroad when we have a splinter in our own eye in DJT threatening the civil rights of the LGBT community. #endtheculturewar
This is an actual thing? Makes sense I guess. After all @popemichael1 lives in Topeka.
I'll practice religious freedom by believing you both are two ass hats who doesn't give a shit about the people. You have destroyed Kansas.
Sorry Jerry. But this is one of your most idiotic tweets.  Unless you were going for sarcasm - in that case this was brilliant
Both of you have the worst intentions for our state, and this nation. Do us a favor and listen to your constituents or get tf OUT!
Glad to have him leave Kansas
Another bigot religious zealot with a "my way or Hell" philosophy.
As long as he steps down and leaves Kansas we will be ecstatic!   Go be someone elses' problem.

@JerryMoran #MoranOut @patroberts @SenPatRoberts #RobertsOut #Kansas #healthcare #HealthCareVote #ACARepealDebate
Have you not been back?  Brownback has nearly destroyed Kansas. Most ineffective Gov KS has EVER had.
Bahahaha good one
This is not a position that should be paid for with tax payer $$!  What a waste of our good hard earned $$. -
Only if they're white conservative Christians. And u sir know that is the truth.
Sam brownback ruined kansas. We will be glad to see him go. Just like we'll be glad to see you go if you vote to repeal ACA
@JerryMoran #MoranOut @patroberts @SenPatRoberts #RobertsOut #Kansas #healthcare #HealthCareVote #ACARepealDebate
I think you meant to say rich white Christian men
You are incredibly out of touch.
Bullshit! I live Kansas and he as driven our economy into the ground. U are a phony. I got to go
You got that wrong he has done nothing to help the Poor and misfortunate he doesn't know what WWJD means!
Fighter of the persecuted* FTFY
Question....is this a real post? If so.....why! Seems a job we could do without with all the budget cuts and all!
That's rich
Where are the comments of praise??? This is one of the most conservative states!!! Where are his voters defending him???    Lmao!!! Good bye
Is he headed to Morocco to stand up for persecuted atheists?

He didn't fight for the children he persecuted after defunding schools until the KS Supreme Court told him to.
If you think the Koch brothers are persecuted. That's who Brownback fought for.
Brownback has done nothing but run the state into the ground.  Our sales tax is one of the highest.  He stole from the poor and give to rich
@JerryMoran #MoranOut @patroberts @SenPatRoberts #RobertsOut #Kansas #healthcare #HealthCareVote #ACARepealDebate
Who nearly destroyed schools, public services, and basically the whole economy in Kansas ha
he's reckless and nearly destroyed that state of Kansas. Quit.
Shut up, Jerry. Your words are worthless.
I'll be GLAD is he leaves Kansas. Sorry the rest of you will have to deal with the Koch brothers puppet.
"If"
You mean the wealthy of Kansas were persecuted and he fought their enemy, the poor who need assistance?
@USCBO scores reported 'Skinny' bill
- 16M more uninsured
- premiums up roughly 20%
- 60 yr old in KS can expect $2,096 increase

Vote NO
Didnt he vote against repeal and replace? After 7 years of mouth? Hmm
He screwed all of Kansas
@JerryMoran #MoranOut @patroberts @SenPatRoberts #RobertsOut #Kansas #healthcare #HealthCareVote #ACARepealDebate
Seems to me he's long been a fighter for the rich and narrow minded. If KS has persecuted people, who are they, & what did he do for them?
We're just happy he's leaving.
