Your blind eye to, and profiteering from ignoring gun control reform directly results in thousands of deaths per year.
What about those in Lawrence where I live with my 5 mo old son? Please help oppose silencers and support reasonable gun control.
When leaders sit back and do nothing it makes it seem like everyone else can. ACT NOW and change #ThoughtsAndPrayersAreNotEnough
Good. Now actually do something so you don't HAVE to send your thoughts and prayers to victims every other day!
Don't pray. ACT.
Please vote NO on the #shareact. You are in the Senate Majority, we are all your constituents. Please hear us.
If I start a Kickstarter to raise $25,000 will you do what Kansans want instead of the @nra?
We've established what Jerry is, now we're just haggling over price.
The FIRST RESPONDERS ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN TAKE ACTION HERE. GO LITTLE MAN, GO!
Stop praying and do something to prevent more gun violence.
Your elected responsibility is to VOTE for change, not pray for your victims.
#GunContolNow
You don’t need to pray, Senator. You need to ACT on gun control legislation, and give back the N.R.A. contributions.
Choosing to do NOTHING about gun violence cannot be your only option.  DO SOMETHING, NOW.
How much money have YOU taken from the NRA?
More than $22,000.
That's just this year. @PatRoberts has taken more than $1.5 million from the NRA. I wonder what the grand total is for @JerryMoran
What is your plan to prevent future mass shootings?
You need to represent people that want sensible gun law reform.
You sold out for $21,350 from the NRA. Your condolences don't run all that deep.
Don’t you get tired of sitting in your DC office tweeting out hollow prayers every time tragedy occurs bc of the laws you refuse to pass?
You voted against the assault weapons ban. 
Your words mean nothing.
I agree with you. The NRA owns him
How many mass shootings have you given your condolences to? 272 this year. Did you ignore some?
Your A rating from #NRA makes your words hollow. Why would ANYONE need automatic assault rifles? Shame on you. #LasVagasShooting #SandyHook
Your prayers mean nothing if you enable the problem.
Now DO something.
You are not going to do anything, the NRA owns you

We are all living in an awful lottery, where any day we could be the ones shot in the next mass shooting. You are part of the problem.
Your condolences and prayers are nice... now do something!! #Itsnottoosoon #GunControl #LasVegas
Then vote to control guns!

You are 1 of 46 votes that contributed. I'm sure the parents of the 59 dead could care less about your "condolences." #SensibleGunLaws
I am confident you will do literally nothing useful in response.

Prayers? Why not donate the $21,350 you have received from the NRA to a fund for the families of the victims? Their blood is on your hands.
Shame on you Jerry Moran. $21K in blood money  - this is on your hands.

#SendBackBloodMoney #JerryMoranKills
Your prayers really don't mean shit
And now we have guns on campus in KS.  How long........


You are a liar a thief and a hypocrite. One day you will have to pay for your actions.
I assure you that the victims and families are waiting to hear about the strong action you intend to take to tighten gun control laws.
We Kansans know you get donations from the nra.  Stop the insanity.  What we're doing isn't working.  APC ammo and silencers?  Insane...
Now that your prayers are done, DO SOMETHING ABOUT CONTROL OF AUTO WEAPONS!!! ALSO, NO SILENCERS.
You put these first responders in harm's way by allowing @NRA to buy your soul.
What are you going to do to prevent another #LasVegasTerroristAttack & the killing of innocent people gather in public?
http://cjonline.com/news/local/crime-courts/2017-10-01/3-shot-dead-lawrence-street-brother-topekan-killed-says-he-was …
Stop being part of the problem. Grow some morals and do something right for a change!
You have blood on your hands. Save your condolences and do something about it!
Your condolences and prayers are about as effective as the shit my dog left outside. Do better.
How can you have "deep" condolences, when your soul is obviously so shallow. Return NRA money. They are not your (only) constituents.
May your complicity in this violence weigh heavy on your soul at the hour of judgement.
Until you follow up with action to help prevent these tragedies, your words are devoid of meaning! Blood is on your hands.
“I also ask you for your warmest condolences for my privates, which are trapped in an NRA money clip that keeps me passing #guncontrol laws
My thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims of the deadly Las Vegas attack.

Many thanks to all the First Responders for their help.
Please stand strong against the tide of those wanting to infringe our 2nd amendment rights.
$22,000 you took from the NRA?
You've got blood on your hands.
Hope you enjoyed the blood $$$$$. Condolences and prayers do not stop bullets, but laws do.
477 Days. 521 Mass Shootings. Zero Action from Congress.

Your prayers mean nothing. Act. Do something. How many prayers to stop shootings? Pathetic.
Prayers are nice but reasonable gun control would go a long way for ALL Americans
Nothing Will Change After the Las Vegas Shooting

Jerry surely u plan on donating money the NRA gave u back to help with the victims funeral expenses and hospital bills
how about you do something instead of sending prayers and maybe send that money back to the #NRAterrorists
Do something

Stop taking NRA money. Stop the silencer bill and ban assault rifles-- they are NOT for hunting. Expand background checks.
Then do something.  Thoughts and prayers are nice. Do something. Protect us for assault rifles
Please support bills to reduce gun violence.
I have a priest whose job is praying. Your job is passing gun control legislation. Do your job! Jesus weeps for your hypocritical prayers.
Senator, return the money you got from NRA. A LOT OF MONEY. It is blood money
What are you going to do to prevent these mass shootings from happening in our nation again? It's time for an #AssaultWeaponsBan in the USA!
How dare you sully the memory of those lost with your inaction. #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Why don’t you do literally anything to stop it from happening again instead of praying for people who’ve already been killed because of it?
Lol same freaking line every tragedy and no one does anything to change
Liar: Your took #BloodMoney $22K from the NRA  #giveitback #guncontrol #KarmaNeverForgets #vegas #TomPetty #LasVegasShooting
It's time to #SendBackTheBloodMoney and stop being complicit in the mass murder of American citizens
Return the blood money and move quickly on assault weapons ban!!  Prayers are worthless, our children deserve better sir!
You took $22,171 in NRA contributions, Senator. Time to stand up to the NRA, #SendBackTheBloodMoney, and support common sense gun laws.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Hey traitor, does that $22k in blood money weigh heavy? How many American lives have you endangered because your pay masters told you to?
What else are you doing?
Now on behalf of myself and my fellow Kansan, I urge you to refund the $$ donated to you by the NRA, then pass stricter gun laws.
Please do something about this.  Background checks, limits on magazines. Something. Anything. Words are useless now.
You took money from the NRA. You’re part of the problem.
Your condolences can't cloak your ineptitude. Ban all assault weapons! They have no place in civilized society.   #LasVegasMassacre
Awww.
To prove you mean it, reject NRA $$, start working on legislation to protect us all.
Meaningless drivel. You have the power to help stop this but refuse to. For MONEY. Blood on your hands. Keep ur prayers & shove ur thanks
Your prayers are not enough.  Stand up to the gun lobby and do something.  No civilian needs that kind of power to protect themselves/
#SendBackTheBloodMoney

You should quit caring more about your NRA money than innocent Americans being mowed down by assault weapons. It's disgusting.
You took $22,171 from @NRA. He'll send "deepest condolences" but won't support bills to reduce gun violence #SendBackTheBloodMoneyi
If we want prayers we will call in the nuns.  Do your fucking job and pass sensible gun control legislation.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney you contributed to this shooting by taking the NRA’s money and doing NOTHING to work towards stricter gun laws.
Listen to what we Americans want, 1.Stop taking $$ from the NRA 2. Work together and vote in common sense gun control NOW
Nobody needs your condolences. WE NEED GUN CONTROL. NRA tool
$21,350.00 from the NRA?  Is it worth it?
You offer bullets, guns & silencers to the shooters but no protection or safety for victims ; just "thoughts & prayers"after each shooting!!
Do something about assault rifles.  We did before.  Do it again.  Follow Senator Murphy's suggestion.
Do they extend all the way to the bank? Specifically when you cash your NRA money? All 22k of it?
"Why, there's nothing we could do. He could have shot 600 from 400 yards with a handgun, too". Shame on you.
Sure Jer - you can send sympathy cards to the 58 victims with all the money you got from the NRA.
Send back the money you were given by the NRA & actually DO something.
Do something then. It’s obvious that whoever you’re praying to isn’t listening.
Thank you for your condolences Senator and I should think your deep sadness would lead you to advocate for safer gun laws in our country,
Please back that up with a strong vote for control of assault weapons. That's the only thing that could save your job.
Prayers aren’t enough. Do something to stop this! This country needs responsible gun control laws. How many more have to die?
Hi Jerry. The $22,000+ that you took from the NRA speaks much louder than any half-ass Twitter prayer.  #SendBackTheBloodMoney
.I read the replies; not one (zero) said "Good job, Jerry". They seem to be justifiably angry with your lack of action. #GOP #DoSomething
Quit talking out of both sides of your mouth. You take gun $ and then want to pray about it.
Why even be a senator if you have no interest in doing your job and actually helping people?
You took $22,171 directly from the @NRA #SendBackTheBloodMoney #KSPol
Doesn't really mean much coming from u when u accept donations from the gun lobby & continue to do nothing to prevent tragedies like this.
"Republicans" = gun lobby. If Sandy Hook didn't change your fetish with unfettered gun access, nothing will.
Then support #gunsense legislation. Thoughts and prayers are just slacktivism.
We won't believe you until you #SendBackTheBloodMoney
.@JerryMoran took $22,171 from @NRA. He'll send "deepest condolences" but won't support bills to reduce gun violence

#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Biggest line of bullshit. How’s that @NRA money doing?

Fuck you and Robba, and your false condolences. 

Why do you keep letting this happen?
You took their money, now you have blood on your hands. Worth it?
You and your thousands of dollars from the gun lobby. This is your fault.
.@JerryMoran took $22,171 from @NRA. He'll send "deepest condolences" but won't support bills to reduce gun violence

#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Your votes CAUSE these massacres.  Your prayers are worth precisely shit, you NRA stooge.  How do you sleep at night?
You have blood money on your hands, Senator. We see you.
Americans are being slaughtered and our government is refusing to take any action to help keep us safe.
Send back the #bloodmoney you took from the #NRA -your prayers mean nothing when you support the #NRA
condolences mean nothing when you support the NRA. you allowed this massacre to happen
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
I hope Robba tells you to give back the blood money
Please save your words unless you're going to do something to prevent more of these senseless acts of mass violence. DO YOUR JOB, YOU WORK FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, NOT THE NRA! The blood of 58+ dead and almost 500 wounded is on your hands.
bullshit #GunControlNOW #StopTheViolence
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Now get this country some gun control.
Does the @NRA write these things for you guys? Fuck off.
You took 22k and change from the NRA!  Not feeling any pangs of  conscience for the violence your support of guns has wrought? 
thoughts and prayers without action are meaningless
Your prayers are with them; the bullets you ensured would pierce their bodies are with them, too. You sold your soul. God help you & us all.
That’s not going to help. You are complicit for every gun death until you do something to make America safe. Stricter gun laws work.
Shootings in Olathe, Overland Park , Kansas. Shameful , worthless words from every Republican. #Gunsense
Prayers but not votes or protection. @NRA has you in their back pocket. $$$ over lives. #NRACreatesCowards
nice NRA endorsements you hollow hearted coward, you and your prayers can fuck off forever
Sending back some of the NRA's $22,000+ donation would probably speak louder than perfunctory "thoughts and prayers."
Their blood is covering you and your family. Blood everywhere.
How the F do you sleep at night after you gleefully accept all those bloody checks from the @NRA?  HOW?????????
You took over $22,000 from NRA $$ to push their agenda. Your condolences mean NOTHING.
How about some legislation, Moran? Too soon to say this? No, it's really too late. Pray if you'd like, but we also want gun control, dude.
How deeply do you feel about the $22K you took from the gun lobby?
Jerry, YOUR prayers are worth nothing. Because the gun industry owns you. Start doing your job for the people, not the weapons industry.

1. Reject all gun lobby money.
2. Pass meaningful gun legislation.

Save your #thoughtsandprayers.

Instead of sending condolences do something that’ll actually mean something to the family. Repeal the 2nd & give back the 22k from the @NRA
But then again you cannot get elected without those extra campaign funds. Those funds for guns are your livelihood. Furthering the oligarchy
You and Robba’s condolences don’t mean a sack of shit if you don’t work to enact sensible gun control legislation.
This 2A tragedy, once again, proudly brought to you by the @NRA and @GOP .
People don’t give a f*** about your thoughts and prayers. People care about congress doing something to end this carnage. Do your job!
Get guns out of the hands of criminally insane and find mental health care! #youarepartoftheproblem
Please DO something.
Can you work with your peers and get guns off our campuses? Please.
Pass some gun laws! Prayers clearly not helping.
Your prayers mean absolutely nothing if you don't do something.
STOP PRAYING AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT GUN CONTROL!!!!!!!!
You're a joke. You're part of this problem. Blood on your hands
.@JerryMoran I hope the thousands the NRA gives you helps you sleep at night knowing there's blood on your hands. 

Sincerely, 

A Kansan
You accepted $13,450 from the gun industry at time of voting. Save your prayers.
I'm praying that you rethink the $2450 in blood money that you accepted from the NRA last year
We can all pray about it, but we elected you to do something to protect us. What are you doing to fix our permissive gun laws?
Don't just pray: ttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/10/upshot/How-to-Prevent-Gun-Deaths-The-Views-of-Experts-and-the-Public.html
