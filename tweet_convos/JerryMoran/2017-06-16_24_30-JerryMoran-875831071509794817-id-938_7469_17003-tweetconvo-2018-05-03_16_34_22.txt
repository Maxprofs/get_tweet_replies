I'm glad you got to visit your loved one in the hospital; it's despicable your attacks on marriage equality would deny that to Crystal.
I feel sorry for you.  A liberal tries to murder him and this is your response.  I'll pray for you.
tell that to the millions that will lose their health care and those denied equal marriage.NixonAzi
Millions lost their insurance when Obamacare was implemented. Conservatives murdered no one over that.
so what makes you a conservative white rich Christian or just plain anal?
I have no love for conservative Christians who likes to impose their will on people. The Left these days are worse.
ok so what does that make you?
An independent that gets tired of whoever abuses power. Libs today are unbearable. Probably wil vote gop until christians regain power.
Praying for you!
We are praying for you Steve !!!
Too bad that under TrumpCare your care at the hospital might not have been enough.
Crystal Griner saved your life..she's an openly married lesbian..you have sponsered anti-LGBT legislation..will you stop being anti-LGBT?
They're family to you but you want to deny their civil rights? How does that even work?
Maybe one of those things isn't true?
His record is what it is. He's worked very hard to deny equal rights to women, queer folk, minorities.
Right, because he supported and worked on Republican legislation...as a republican, he somehow hates minorities? What evidence do you have?
Please don't bring back lifetime caps and pre-existing conditions in any way, shape, or form.  This is serious!
Get well soon Sir, Thoughts & Prayers for you & your family as well as the other victims and families ! God Speed
God Bless You All Praying 
#Griner is a HERO. We should all commend her bravery and selflessness. Thank you! @EMathenyBooks @ezas123
I pray the Lord to watch over Steve & family and for a speedy recovery as the holy spirit  mends his body.
We are with you
Maybe he'll change his views on gun control after this?
http://modernliberals.com/sorry-dont-feel-ounce-sympathy-steve-scalise/ â€¦
yeah, maybe we can finally get gun control for liberals. No guns for liberals=reduced gun violence.
I'll second that ....
I second that also!
Much love. I'm a liberal but human first and foremost and this never should have happened.
Best reply ever.  Thank you, sweet Carrie.  *hugs*
Hugs back!
Hey Jerry, silent about GOP health care?Guess you haven't seen it either. What is GOP plan senator? QUIT HIDING!!!
God will heal and give back what the Devil tried to steal O God bless heal and help this family now in their time of need thank you
You are in our hearts  and prayers. God bless you. Let's all pray our Republic survives these liberal attacks. Stand together as Americans
when you get better you might want to rethink your hatred towards others ... unfortunately you had to experience karma the hard way - LEARN!
yet you're posting hate to a man in critical condition. Shame on you.
can you read and comprehend? try again ...
My thoughts exactly. Why would they deny someone they view as family the same rights that they have? Here's to a speedy recovery.
Adding our prayers for all of the people injured. So horrific!  In our back yard, a place where children were playing. I'm so sorry!
I'd like to add, it is all our back yard. I'm continuing to pray for all.
Out of line.
To me it was neither the time nor place. Freedom of speech, though. I'm trying to present myself better after that. Everyone really should.
We need to establish a calm conversation between both sides. Violence resolves nothing. Actually, it proves weakness on issues; Desperation.
Agreed. I voted for Trump but I'm an Independent. Not everyone who chose him agree w/ Establishment Politicians. We need 2 stop violence now
Thank god that black dyke was there ti take out the shooter and save your life..u know..the people that should have no rights...hmmm
I bet jesus put here there for you to change your hateful ways......best be paying attention.
Continuing to pray.
I am so sorry that this has happened to you and your family! The shooter can't hurt anyone else but, @realDonaldTrump can! Don't support him
Prayers for a full recovery.
