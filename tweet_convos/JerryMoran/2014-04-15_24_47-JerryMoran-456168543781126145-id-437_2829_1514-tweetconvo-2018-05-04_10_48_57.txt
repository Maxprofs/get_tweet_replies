We know where the accuracy is... RT @RumsfeldOffice: That I & most Americans have no idea whether our taxes are accurate tells us something.
@KagroX @RumsfeldOffice And that TV remote! Why so many buttons?
.@carsonstanwood @KagroX @RumsfeldOffice and you do your own taxes?
@dkauf1043 You don't file with the return you want. You file with the return you have!
.@carsonstanwood I guess I have to take that as a no.
@dkauf1043 I did my return with the calculator on my Obamaphone.
.@carsonstanwood it's actually a Clinton/Gore phone, but that's ok.
@dkauf1043 At the least the calculator works. Maybe I should lend it to Paul Ryan!
@RumsfeldOffice "No idea?" So you both committed perjury when you declared it was true to the best of your knowledge.
.@anacanapana @RumsfeldOffice he's being honest, 2 the best of his knowledge...just like the rest of us.  Is #IRS honest...like Lois Lerner?
@dkauf1043 @RumsfeldOffice "To the best of my knowledge" and "I have no idea" are not at all the same.
.@anacanapana @RumsfeldOffice now your just trying to be a pain...you know what his point is, admit it.
.@theonlyadult @RumsfeldOffice Iraq debt pales to the #Obama created debt.
.@theonlyadult @RumsfeldOffice you are funny, like cancer.
@theonlyadult More fitting to view the likes of @dkauf1043  and @RumsfeldOffice as a venereal disease. #fullofclass
@theonlyadult @DDSSBlog @RumsfeldOffice LIV.
@RumsfeldOffice @Rtreatwilliams #IRS maybe he ought to think about the trillions of our tax money he spent in Iraq rather than complain.
@Robertwaldeck maybe so
@RumsfeldOffice @NotGayJared slightly classier than sketch of middle finger but same idea 
@RumsfeldOffice let me guess - black people shouldn't be in office right?
@RumsfeldOffice @MiaFarrow So you knew exactly how much $ under, Nixon, Ford and Bush? Or did you write letters then too?
@RumsfeldOffice May our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ forgive you for all that you have done.   Most of us will not.
@RumsfeldOffice @MiaFarrow Give your money away and be a greeter at WalMart. Chances are you won't make enough to have to pay taxes.
An 8% #FLATTAX on all forms of income, would eliminate the need for you to send this letter Rummy “@RumsfeldOffice: ”
Just imagine how much harder it would be if you were an #accidentalamerican. Our audition here:
@RumsfeldOffice You do realise that if you get your return wrong, they'll waterboard you!
@RumsfeldOffice @MiaFarrow - Rejected; tax forms have some 'unknowns' and some 'known' knowns that seem to have  been entered by a chimp
.@RumsfeldOffice when are you gonna turn yourself in?
@RumsfeldOffice Great letter!   You spoke for me as well!
@RumsfeldOffice An honest crook. Go figure.
@RumsfeldOffice Did you send your letter to the Treasury, Senate Finance and Ways and Means, who r responsible 4 tx policy?
@RumsfeldOffice Your IRS letter is interesting.  You listed the wrong address, and you address it an entity that does not handle tax policy.
@RumsfeldOffice @cecill is this a "known unknown" or an "unknown unknown"
@RumsfeldOffice use 1040EZ roll it into a tube and pack 10 pounds of  aspertaine in your assperdonald that should focus you .
@RumsfeldOffice Thanks for stating what majority of US Taxpayers have been thinking; I have a CPA do my estimated taxes & probably overpay !
@RumsfeldOffice
.@RumsfeldOffice haha remember that time you sent thousands of people to die
@RumsfeldOffice @MiaFarrow whilst I'm not a fan of Rumpelstiltskin, he does make sense here.

Why I love @RumsfeldOffice: @panotes  ”
now, finally, i do like Donald Rumsfeld @RumsfeldOffice @jliszka  have no idea whether our taxes are accurate #IRS:
@RumsfeldOffice Accuracy is a tricky thing isn't it? A bit like the evidence for Weapons of Mass Destruction.
@MatthewLumby @RumsfeldOffice Which you know damn well, that most western nations intel service thought were there also, as well as Billary
@RumsfeldOffice @MiaFarrow You file your taxes with the tax code knowledge you have, not what you would like to have.
Would @RumsfeldOffice consider the #IRS tax code a 'known unknown' or an 'unknown unknown'? Read his awesome letter:
@RumsfeldOffice @MiaFarrow Interesting..here is one of the guys that put us into the most expensive wars that perhaps might have sunk d USA
@RumsfeldOffice Says it all and oh so true.  Hope you and Mrs Rumsfeld are around a long time.  Thank you for your service to our country.
@RumsfeldOffice @lukebroadwater striving for relevance
@RumsfeldOffice @WBKnoblock I'm going to include a similar letter with my returns next year. Seems like a good idea if audited.
@RumsfeldOffice @jaketapper you know who knows exactly what to pay? Wage workers. You have complex finances, man up #STEM
@RumsfeldOffice @AZnealz it's not the known unknown tax schedules, it's the unknown known lines that complicate the issue
.@RumsfeldOffice I know, right? But not as complex as the books written about you.
“@tejucole: .@RumsfeldOffice I know, right? But not as complex as the books written about you. ”
The responses to @RumsfeldOffice's tweet about taxes separates the moderately intelligent from the idiots. If you can't tell the difference…
@Hilohaw Your tweet separates you from the real earners who pay taxes. More complicated than filing for (un)Earned Income Tax Credit. #tcot
@soonerman_mike You misread my tweet. I wrote "RESPONSES." Rumsfeld is right. Read my profile, or the previous tweet. (P.S. - I'm a CPA.)
@Hilohaw I will reread them. But please accept my apology in advance. Had just finished a debate w/a lib. My BP was up. Brain was down.
@soonerman_mike TY, I understand. And my 2nd tweet was sort of ambiguous, w/o the 1st. Taxes are way too complex, so I applaud Rumsfeld!
@Hilohaw I read again. I truly am sorry. I try not to do that. Been on the other end b4. You were gracious when it wasn't deserved.
@soonerman_mike TY. No worries. I've done the same thing - a natural hazard with 140-character communication. Won't stop the fight, though!
@soonerman_mike (The fight to get our country back, that is...)
@RumsfeldOffice @MiaFarrow scary man
@RumsfeldOffice How many KNOWS in that??? ;)
@RumsfeldOffice
@RumsfeldOffice @tejucole Lucky Mr. Rumsfeld. Millions in their 80s living on Soc Sec. Govt service made U rich. Sorry abt those taxes, man.
@RumsfeldOffice Totally agree. Do you get hit with the $5K frivolous filing penalty that the IRS can assess?
@RumsfeldOffice @the_tpa Perhaps we could get Norman Tebbit to do the same to HMRC?
@RumsfeldOffice @ryandjohnson lol! So much irony.
@RumsfeldOffice Thank you, sir!  You are truly an American Patriot!  Thank you for your service to the country.
@RumsfeldOffice @elavasam what he did to simplify that when he was in office ? :)
@RumsfeldOffice not he first unknown unknown, must no be so scary? Why not mek oublic how much your accountants charged you?
@RumsfeldOffice so what you're saying is that if it's all fucked up, it couldn't possibly be your fault?  seems to be your life's code.
@RumsfeldOffice Known Unknown
@RumsfeldOffice 

Look to Norway!
@RumsfeldOffice we could say the same about UK tax system, you need a U.S. @Jemsherwood + OTS to start simplification! //cc @JudithFreedman
“@scedwar: @RumsfeldOffice like UK tax system, you need a U.S. @Jemsherwood + OTS to start simplification! //” // but task of Sisyphus
@RumsfeldOffice  TurboTax is all I know.  I think IRS should be required to produce open source app implementing their code.
@RumsfeldOffice Rum, if you have college degree doesn't mean  you're smart. To me you're an Oalf, war criminal.

  big Oalf. Just a
@RumsfeldOffice Takes me 10 minutes to do mine. I don't make enough to have all those "inconvenient" loopholes to lower my tax rate, I guess
“@RumsfeldOffice: My annual letter to the #IRS: ”  I'm  Rolling... But Ole Rummy's got a good point though
@RumsfeldOffice My guess is this has only been "annual" since 2008 or later. Did you ever ask BUSH if he could simplify, or was it OK then?
@RumsfeldOffice there are known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns. But this I do know: this is an amazing letter.
“@RumsfeldOffice: My annual letter to the #IRS: ”

Might be the first time I've ever agreed with Donald Rumsfeld...
@BradBirdA113 But his solution, like many conservatives, is a regressive flat tax.
@GlennF @BradBirdA113 a flat tax only makes sense.
@JakeEppert @BradBirdA113 Flat taxes are regressive.
@GlennF While I know what you're saying, that's totally inaccurate. Flat taxes are proportionally the same for all. Not that I like it much.
@davidcondolora That’s incorrect. It’s only literally flat. In effect, the %age has a regressive impact on poor.
@GlennF Sure, because they make less. But it does treat everyone the same. And most flat tax plans try to account for that via rebates.
@davidcondolora Right, but then it’s not a flat tax per se! Marginal tax rates applied fairly with very few ratchets can work well.
Read the replies -> @RumsfeldOffice no idea whether our taxes are accurate. My annual letter to the #IRS:
@RumsfeldOffice Dear Sir.. I'm glad that you notice how lawyers and part of public employees protect their jobs: at our and efficiency exp.
@RumsfeldOffice you should be behind bars.
@RumsfeldOffice We have questioned your ability to understand many things over the decades.  So your letter is no surprise.
@josh_miller, as a college graduate @RumsfeldOffice should know to forward this letter to the people who actually WRITE the tax code.
@joefritz :)
@RumsfeldOffice @mkelly007 When I was in high school, I learned how to fill out my own taxes in class. What's your excuse?
@RumsfeldOffice @askForCharon Funny, Don, we all could say the same thing about your intelligence on WMD in Iraq.

@Tefrin @RumsfeldOffice He was actually Secretary of Defense, not VP.
@willsmith @RumsfeldOffice Ah well im Canadian :D Its ok for me to get them mixed up.
@RumsfeldOffice @willsmith Considering the source, it's actually not a bad statement... a disclaimer involving 'ignorance' in hope of pardon
@RumsfeldOffice as your esteemed colleague once told Sen. Leahy of Vermont on the Senate floor: ...

@RumsfeldOffice @stdoyle Yes.
@RumsfeldOffice When did you get all interested in accuracy or having any idea what's going on?
@RumsfeldOffice   Tax codes are designed to confuse us for their benefit to gain more money. Good luck on getting it simplified.
@RumsfeldOffice @jaketapper If Rumsfeld couldn't figure out his taxes, maybe he shouldn't have been put in charge of all our military forces
Funny, I curse your name each year that I've filed taxes since 2003. RT@RumsfeldOffice: My annual letter to the #IRS:

@RumsfeldOffice AGREED! .. I have no idea what the Federal Tax Law actually is, so I have no idea if I am lawfully complying with it #TaxDay

"there are things that we know that we know. We also know there are known unknowns;" @RumsfeldOffice @Heritage Rummy's taxes are an unknown.
