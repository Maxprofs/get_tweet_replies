omg this girl is so precious
it's a shame that she is now witnessing the worse president in our history.
Donald Trump isn't the worst president. There were presidents before hand that were far worse than him.

I love everything about this
I love this little girl Macey she so cute xx
#PresidentsDay
@hmkoepke2 you'll make your child dress like this
so will @Aleshaguenther
no false teeth tho. #disappointed
Macey is so precious. She's delightful. I feel so bad that she gets to witness such a failure as the President.
I think about her regularly
we should rename it Prescedent's 1-44 Day... 
That little girl is amazing! 
@handzyhamzy hehe
I love her so much
Love this little girl! Please have her more often Ellen.
@ZoomTan #MakeAmericaTanAgain  http://www.zoomtan.com

I love that girl!  
@raeleenikole
@dariastauffer

this girl is honestly annoying at this point
"I Shot Andy Warhol"('96) is a perfect movie for the gays to watch;I know it pisses you off.Everybody lies, Everybody dies!
I recall meeting Daniela Groch while she was tryinig to seduce 2 white female straight abroad students at the '99 Wigram House
She's just my favourite!!
I'm not American!
I love this kid!
Thanks for introducing us to Macey. Such a delightful&independent girl! Saddens me that 45 is too corrupt to discuss with her
can't wait til the show starts. Thank you for continuing to uncover these delightful children
https://youtu.be/YoIixWPr_qQ  my hit song
Ellen DeGeneres for President
who r u?
she's so cute!!
Hope she wont be dressing up as Trump anytime soon
Cute kid, but I think Ellen is joking around with little kids now too! to make a point about herself, not being like them.
kiddo in boots, "Gunna catch me some mud-puppies!" Mama, "Democrats or Republicans, dear?"
@elisemc926
OMG  this is just too good
@GabbyUpson
can't wait to watch your show today
ooooohh Macey is soo adorable!!
aw she is literally the cutest little girl ever <3
@kgomboz 
she is just so adorable. Happy #Presidentsday America & Happy #FamilyDay2017 Toronto Canada
she is too cute 

how could a #PresidentDay be "adorable" if we have @realDonaldTrump as POTUS? HOW?
lol
how delightful

If a kid is dressed up as Trump, I'm going to call abuse.
i hope they all dress like trump
goodmorning  Macey an mrs. Ellen
Donald Trump better.
follow me please i love you 
how adorable
so cute, and intelligent.
I do too lol
SO CUTE!!!

Lmao
