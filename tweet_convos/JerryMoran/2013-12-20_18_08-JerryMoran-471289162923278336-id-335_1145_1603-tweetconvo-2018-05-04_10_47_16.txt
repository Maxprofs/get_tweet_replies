@jimmykimmel okey joe's is pretty darn good but I think bb's lawnside is my favorite: BBQ nachos.
@jburn @jimmykimmel That's also NOT Waldo. Lol. You need a bulletproof vest. But it IS awesome BBQ
@fitch0402 @jimmykimmel aw, it is NOT that bad! Now if you went north on Troost a ways, then maybe.
@jburn @jimmykimmel I worked for a company involved in the two year replacement of the 85th st bridge over troost. It IS that bad. Lol.
