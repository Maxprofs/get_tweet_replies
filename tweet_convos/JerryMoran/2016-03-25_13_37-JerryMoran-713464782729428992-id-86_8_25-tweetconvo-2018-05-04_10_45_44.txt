@JerryMoran Statement makes no sense. If you're so sure investigation would reveal Garland as unsuitable, why not have a hearing? #pathetic
@JerryMoran Good to see you joined rest of #GOP senators masquerading  as working but really just welfare recipients. #FireHim
@JerryMoran please quit if you will not do your job! You are stealing tax payer money while working for the gop establishment! #DoYourJob
@JerryMoran Senator, respect the Constitution and give Judge Garland a hearing and fair vote. #DoYourJob
@JerryMoran Just another pathetic feckless politician who won't do his fucking job #DoYourJob
@JerryMoran Afraid of your own failing party. Pussy. #unemployed #out
@JerryMoran #DoYourJob
@JerryMoran Thank you sir for standing strong for the people. #NoHearingsNoVotes
@JerryMoran So the GOP leadership got to you, eh Sen. Moran?  You are an incredibly weak willed man. #DoYourJob!
@JerryMoran Senator, did you now to pressure or are you really this spineless?
@JerryMoran public sentiment is that you are betraying your party and constituents. I hope not.
@JerryMoran In thirty years they will write history about the old white men in the 2015 Senate and their racist actions against Obama
@Zinnia66 @JerryMoran Bingo, there it is again! Can't win an argument so throw out the old reliable "racist" label.
@jeffallen1987 @JerryMoran Just saying history will view this like Strom Thurmans Civil rights stands.
@Zinnia66 @JerryMoran No comparison.
@jeffallen1987 @JerryMoran I'm glad you don't think so, but from my seat it doesn't look that way.
@JerryMoran you were going to stop the partisan bickering and give the man a hearing. But you let the jerks get to you. Politics as usual.
@JerryMoran Rewrite. Thank you for showing us how strong your convictions are.
@JerryMoran Thank you for having courage to stand up to those who use their undue influence to change your position on a hearing. Oh wait...
@JerryMoran Time to abandon that opposition...many things you think disqualify Garland actually recommend him.
@JerryMoran It's pretty embarrassing that you couldn't stick up for yourself. And I thought the Democrats were supposed to be wimps.
@JerryMoran #DoYourJob
@JerryMoran coward
@JerryMoran Would rather follow Tea Party than follow Constitution, so slanders highly respected nominee. What a disgrace.  #doyourjob
@JerryMoran coward
@JerryMoran POTUS court nominee may end up better than Madame Secretary, good you're keeping your hands out & options open.
@JerryMoran As a Repub, you better oppose Obama's anti-gun nominee!  Obama's goal is OWG Tyranny!  First step - Americans must be disarmed!
@JerryMoran Jerry is not fit to lead. Resign. You can't do the job.
@JerryMoran Since you can only control your vote who is going to stop the ' usual suspect' RINOs from approval vote if you have hearings?
@JerryMoran You say you would vote against him but don't you hear the ROAR of the electorate that knows Repub Sen  can't be trusted.
@JerryMoran Thank you for your opposition to this POTUS's appointees. We do not need hearings. Let the checks and balances work!
@JerryMoran We know this game. #nohearingnovote
@JerryMoran   You should read this, Mr. Moran.   https://www.creators.com/read/thomas-sowell/03/16/supreme-hypocrisy …
.@JerryMoran: I'd rather risk screwing up America for decades than to have people say mean things about me for a few months. #coward
@JerryMoran You were elected to represent the people of Kansas, not to do the bidding of Obama.
@JerryMoran Then why are you in favor of a hearing???  Its not your responsibility. Nothing says you have to. Stand by your party.
@JerryMoran  --  I find your new statement so disappointing after your previous awesomeness:   http://ow.ly/ZYBGh 
@JerryMoran I just came to congratulate you for seeming to #DoYourJob but I see you've lost ur work ethic.Why do we elect you ppl? btw I'm R
@JerryMoran please don't vote for Obama's supreme Court nominee!
@jhawk1986 unfortunately he's siding with Bernie Sanders and supporting having a hearing for Merrick Garland #NoHearingsNoVotes @JerryMoran
@JerryMoran Sen. Biden's 1992 speech in which he pledged to block any nominee that President George H.W.
@JerryMoran Keep talking about meetings re:Garland & see if your ass doesn't get primaried in Nov!
@JerryMoran Sounds like backpedaling. You're a surprise addition to my list of cavers https://twitter.com/dark_poplar/status/698925950554271746 … @IngrahamAngle @marklevinshow
Only 3 Republican senators remain who voted to confirm Sotomayor: Alexander, Collins & Graham http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/07/31/us/politics/0731-sotomayor-vote.html?_r=1& … @megynkelly @Judgenap
@JerryMoran needs to get out of the cave away from crazies who've destroyed the GOP . the air of common sense is quite refreshing. #ksleg
@JerryMoran he still deserves a hearing.
@JerryMoran Have a hearing, make the case. Do your job. Meanwhile, remember that the Supreme Court is not a political appointment.
@JerryMoran you're only opposed to Garland bc Obama is making the nomination. GOP can't even get stuff together yet you still play games
TY @JerryMoran for considering hearings for SCJ. It's what u are all paid to do. 9 mos w/o 1 is too long. #DoYourJob
@JerryMoran The Democrats will oppose you no matter what. Now you're going to lose conservatives. Bad move. #BidenRule
@JerryMoran why is your allegiance to your party instead of the voters who put you in office? EVERY poll shows we want a vote. #DoYourJob
@staceyschmitz @JerryMoran Those who ACTUALLY DID vote for him do not want Merrick Garland.
@JerryMoran I hold hope. That my great state will wake up and take back Kansas. You have proven that you are owned by your party.
@JerryMoran All those on the left are asking is conduct hearings. McConnell announcing the night Scalia died no hearings was idiotic.
@JerryMoran   screw the republicans, take back the senate
@JerryMoran Pleas give him a hearing.
@JerryMoran Specifically, why do you oppose him?  With no hearing you have no basis beyond who nominated him. Stand up & #DoYourJob
@JerryMoran Prove it. Don't even OK a vote on that liberal POS.
@JerryMoran uh he got relected, didn't he?
@JerryMoran do your job!!!
.@JerryMoran Please do not cave to Democrat pressure. Think of the people in KS who actually voted for you. #BidenRule #NoHearingsNoVotes
@WichiWaldo @JosephAshbyShow @JerryMoran  and think of the people who voting against you
@JerryMoran Thorough investigation wouldn't disqualify him in eyes of this Kansan. Obama still Pres. He's doing his job, you #DoYourJob.
@JerryMoran not a profiles in courage moment.
@JerryMoran tell the people of Kansas one thing, but promise McConnell another eh,?  Get ready for another job Judas.
@JerryMoran disappointed in your full statement. This #Kansan thinks Garland deserves consideration.
@JerryMoran thanks for ur initial support of hearings for #MerrickGarland sorry to hear the @TPPatriots whose name bust be ironic bullied u
@JerryMoran this makes absolutely no sense.  Why risk the 2nd amendment over a pointless hearing.  We all can look up his positions already.
@JerryMoran Of course you are! But Senate: #DoYourJob & hold hearings. #SCOTUS
@JerryMoran so, Senator, you support gerrymandering & killing a healthcare plan akin to what the '12 GOP nominee got going in Massachusetts?
@JerryMoran of course you oppose the choice! The president isn't in your party! That's how Washington works,  right?
@JerryMoran I just sent 100 dollars to the Judicial Crisis Network, and will be happy to send money to primary you.  No hearing.
@JerryMoran Not this Kansan. Do you job, act on the nominee!!
@JerryMoran Stay strong; don't give in to the obstructionists. Kansans appreciate your stated desire to hold the hearing
@JerryMoran Don't lose your spine, Kansans want you to #DoYourJob
@JerryMoran People said wanted Obama picking TWICE- just because you don't like that answer doesn't mean you take your ball and go home
@JerryMoran so give him a public hearing.
@JerryMoran but WHY do you oppose Garland? Give an actual reason. Obama appointing him isn't good enough.
@JerryMoran you lost your spine so quickly... Be against him, but give him a vote. #Moron
@JerryMoran Awesome. More than likely the appointee you will have to vote on will be even farther left.
