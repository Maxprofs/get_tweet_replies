22 million other families don't want to lose their dad either.   Vote no on #Trumpcare.
Not the time or place for that.
You don't get to select the timing of my comments.  It's the perfect time for that.
Freedom!
So sorry for your loss.
My condolences. However the #BCRA is going to cut funding for nursing homes which means a lot of elderly people dying in the streets.
I hope all govt hc is repealed just to ensure not one dime of my money goes to helping you.
His dad died under ocare. However, both bills are horrible and need 2 b destroyed. Freedom is always the best solution
Agreed. The total disfunction in DC is completrly predictable given the insane amount of power and money progressives trusted them with.
On both sides. There's precious few that actually want to govern via constitution
The republican party is a progressive party that is openly hostile to its tea party element.
Please don't gut hospice.
I hope all govt hc is repealed just to ensure not one dime of my money goes to helping you.
Sorry for your loss, Jeff. My dad passed 15 years ago and I still think of him every day, just as you will think of your father.
Sorry for your loss, don't take away my families health care.
Ocare took my families. No government interference is always a better answer
Very sorry for your great loss. May God comfort & keep you.
Sorry for your loss
Im sorry to hear of your loss @JeffFlake prayers for you and your family!!
Sorry for your loss. I lost my Mom a year ago. Very hard. But I know she's with the Lord. May you and your family find comfort as you mourn.
Jeff, I am so sorry. I really really liked your dad. He was a great guy, a very fine man. Let me know if I can do anything to help - xoxoxo
Blessed Journey Home Dean. Sorry for you and your families loss.
I am sorry for your loss. You are fortunate to have had such a positive role model.
My deepest sympathy to you and your family. May God's love a grace bring you comfort. May your warm memories bring you the great joy.
You have my sincere condolences on this tremendous loss.
His position on health care as a right? Because if he was all rugged individualist + personal responsibility, what if you'd been born sick?
Sorry for his family and friends loss.
lol
I am so sorry for your loss!  Praying comfort, strength & peace for your family!
Sorry for your loss.
Probably died of a broken heart because his son has betrayed this State in every way. At least your Father had Healthcare. 
Now he can RIP.
Really?  You had to make a political statement?
you should be happy for him.  now, he doesn't have to see you ruin our country with the @GOP as you've been doing. #RIP
Sorry to hear that Jeff, Prayers are with your family !
Sorry for your loss God Rest his soul
So sorry for your loss.
Condolences.
Deepest sympathy @JeffFlake. No one is ever ready for turning of generations,child>adult orphan. Wishing peace & strength,heart to honor him
Sincere condolences... Would your hero advise you to take health care away from the poor? No hero would.
When it means forcing working Americans to cover the cost of insuring all the welfare leeches,then yes, ANY hero would
In his memory, vote no on AHCA.
His dad died under ocare. I hope he votes no on this and yes on complete repeal of ocare
The loss of a parent is one of the most difficult things we go through in life, but it helps to think we will see them again.
My condolences to you and your family for your loss. I lost my dad in 2015.
Very sorry to hear that, senator.
So sad to hear of your loss. All the best wishes to you. I think we are distantly related as I am a "Flake"  too. William Jordan line
May God bless you and your family.
To my fellow D's saying horrible things to Sen Flake, your disregard for human life makes you a hypocrite when u complain about GOP bill.
So sorry for your loss Senator. My prayers go out to you and your family. He must have been very proud of you
The day.I lost my Dad was one the hardest days in my life. God bless you Senator
Despite who he was or what he knew he would be even more proud of you if your goal was to help humanity even if it's against party politics!
Hopefully, he'll vote no along with ridding us of ocare, which has stripped my family of health insurance.  No government interference
Wait til you get the new proposal. You thought it was bad before...
My mom passed away last week. My condolences to you and your family. Hardest thing Iâ€™ve had to face in my entire life.
My Condolences, please consider how fragile life is and vote NO to the #weathcare act. America needs to be kind again.
Think of your dad and don't kill millions of Americans with that faux healthcare plan. We know it's only to stop tax cuts on very wealthy.
His dad died under ocare. Hope he votes no, yet yes on complete repeal of ocare.
No, his father didn't use ACA. He had private insurance because he was wealthy and didn't need subsidies. Stop lying.
So sorry for your loss of a great man.  You and your family are in our thoughts.
Sorry for your loss...
A sad day. I still think about my Mum every day, mostly laughing now. That took a few years. The first 6, laughed and cried on & off. Work+
Sending you good wishes
