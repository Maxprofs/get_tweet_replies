@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump but his poll numbers ARE serious.  Your party needs to give your voters a serious counter to this madness.
@Brennanator @JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump Trump has traction for one reason: RINOS like Flake don't represent their constituency. That's it.
@BryonWine and Trump does? A man who's benefitted more from the corporate welfare state than anyone? @JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump
@Brennanator @JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump Trump doesn't have a constituency yet. You're totally missing the point.
@BryonWine I guess I am - what are you trying to talk about? You're calling Flake a RINO so I guess you're saying Trump isn't a RINO?
@Brennanator I won't vote for him, but he's holding their feet to the fire.
Thanks for your service to our great country, BTW.
@JeffFlake @dixiegirl7457 @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna I agree wth this. It is time to take America back. WE ARE AMERICA NOT MUSLIM!
@wade_bridges1 @JeffFlake @dixiegirl7457 @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna it's embarrassing that you have "dr" in front of your name.
@GoodVib59414700 You must be a Democrat. And by the way, I earned that "DR". I have 2 of them. Education helps one see the problems.
@wade_bridges1 my political affiliation has nothing to do with civil discourse of relevant facts.
@GoodVib59414700  Have you read the Quran?  I have. There but one version. Read it. You might learn something.
@wade_bridges1 I hate Islam. I don't hate all Muslims. Learn the difference.
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump lifelong progressive who appreciates your actions to counter bigotry. Well done Senator.
Iwill definitely weep. No question.
Trump had a lien placed against for failure to pay for svcs rendered. Judge also
@JeffFlake Glad to hear you feel that way. Now we need some serious thought on gun reform in AZ. My vote depends on it. @realDonaldTrump
@JeffFlake @MJGerson I wouldn't expect anything approaching "serious thought" from the likes of him.
@JeffFlake @ForQ2  true but he does seem to reflect the GOP who are doing nothing to stop him!
Hey troll, looking at your posts ,and lack of followers, you are the dumbest troll on Twitter.Buh bye!
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna a bit like Nauvoo? Thank you for your support. You should be prez
why would I go to Mexico my fam been here since 1640--you leave!
@JeffFlake @ForQ2 @realDonaldTrump Trump has stooped so low that he can kiss his own ass which given his narcissism would make his day
In your dreams and in every sane person's nightmare.
@JeffFlake i disagree. @realDonaldTrump represents perfectly the authoritarian views of Conservatives in America.
@David747Heavy @JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump Make no mistake  the ENTIRE Republican party IS America's largest and most extreme hate group! !
so says the ASS!!
@JeffFlake @mtnlovertoo @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna and exactly what does a Muslim look like? What country includes religion on its passports?
@davejshea Muslim isnt a religion or a race. Islam is the ideological system of religion. @JeffFlake @mtnlovertoo @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna
@katzeye75 I get that but @realDonaldTrump could use some brushing up on the topic
@davejshea Did you know there was a Pro-ISIS rally in Michigan? Look, Islamic State flags.... @realDonaldTrump
#NoBanNoWall #nomuslimban
@realDonaldTrump You @JeffFlake have been in govt since 01. Why haven't you fixed this problem? Terrorists have LEGALLY entered since 00!
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump And we know RINOS like Flake are lining up behind lost cause Jeb Bush. His response isn't surprising.
.@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump At this point Trump has quadrupled down on insane
Long as he stays behind his silly wall America is welcome to his sorry ass
@JeffFlake As an Arizona resident, I am heartened to see you speak up like this. Thank you.
What are you doing to stop the unconstitutional #muslimban instituted by @realDonaldTrump?
@JeffFlake Trump vs. Hillary, whom would you vote for?
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump  Get it straight, Mr. Flake, we ARE AT WAR! They want to kill us. Do you want to allow that? #tcot
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump Jeff, change your last name.. President trump.
................GO TRUMP !!! 2016 . HE IS THE MAN TO BLOCK ALL OF OBAMA'S STUPID ENFORCEMENTS !!!
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna I am a democratic for Jeff flake. Thank you for your service to AZ
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump LOVE TRUMP! NOT YOU
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump LOVE LOVE DONALD TRUMP YOU AND MCCAIN ARE THE REAL PROBLEM!!!!! GO TRUMP YOU ARE LOW FLAKE YOU LIE TO US
@JeffFlake @MattColtHall @realDonaldTrump Yeah, we need to embrace, caress, & worship our enemies!  What in the world is he thinking?!?!?
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna Neither does your obvious and idiotic pandering at the mosque.
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump I support Trump.
@JeffFlake: I see you following Trump's path. Your proposed bill #HR158 not even prevent San Bernardino attacks, they were Pakistanis.
@JeffFlake Jeff stop thinking, @realDonaldTrump does reflect 70% of Americans. u reflect the 1% who's heads will explode when he is elected.
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump FINALLY! France Raids Mosque. What They Found Inside Proves TRUMP IS RIGHT.http://patriotupdate.com/finally-france-raids-mosques-what-they-found-inside-proves-trump-is-right/ …
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump  Trump has his finger on the pulse of American ppl, Flake has his finger on the pulse of the prostate. #tcot
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna Jeb! said we should only admit Christians. Republican governors have refused Muslim refugees. Serious?
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna Yes they do. Lordy you establishment folks are cowardly. He says it, establishment thinks it.
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump you used to be a decent person. What promises did the Muslims make when they bought you out?
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump A flaky comment.
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna actually it is good that someone is directly addressing the problem
@JeffFlake @briankboucher @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna #bulshitartist do just that , excel in going lower each time!
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump  Therefore Trumps statement is unconstitutional.
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump America’s constitution apparently states that there should be no discrimination on the basis of religion..
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna Donald trump will ruin America. Anyone who votes for him is equally as stupid as his ideas.
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna same for your POTUS
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump Why don't you RINOs grow a set and do something about the muzzies so The Donald doesn't have to Trump you . .
@JeffFlake Recent events should prove @realDonaldTrump is correct.
ISIS is HERE, ALREADY, and was invited here by Pres O & his supporters!:(
@JeffFlake When invertebrate R's {Republicants} start telling it like we common R voters know it is, I'll stop supporting @realDonaldTrump.
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump trump continues to play the media like a Stradivarius. GOP opp candidates still can't get their message out
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump #Trump2016 #TeamTrump #Trump is saying exactly what Americans want to say, but are to afraid to discuss it!
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump Are you #WakStupid, #Homie? #ATemporaryBanOnMuslims is agreeable by 33 states. They don't want 'em.#YourMinority
@JeffFlake And what is your solution to securing homeland, Sen. Brilliantly Do-Nothing Flake? As AZ voter I'd like to know @realDonaldTrump
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna a way to win votes with pretending to do the impossible!!
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump It's about time to tell this guy YOU'RE FIRED!
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna has any one figured out that white Christians kill many times more Americans than muslims
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump  Yes Flake, you and the rest of the Progressives (idiots) won't be happy till we are all dead.
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump 

The two main reasons Trump exists:
1. Obama 
2. RINOs

Conservative voters are sick of both.
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump : Trump is right we do not need Allah lovers in our country!
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump The world should ban @Trump from traveling to any country whether he wins or not.
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump Bruce Bauer, a NYT journalist moved to Amsterdam to marry his partner. His testimony,
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump Exactly... so why is everyone making a fuss about it... seems to me people are just too sodding sensitive
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump Check out "Muslims", the controversial new cut from forthcoming Donald music TRUMP!
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump trump is so so wrong and himself now a threat to our national security.
@JeffFlake @ForQ2 @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna his birther stuff was the same .quit  pretending this is new
@JeffFlake @batchelorshow @realDonaldTrump 25%. I believe it.
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump     terrorist father should be charged with aiding his son and he knew he devoted himself to ISIS @ said nothing
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump what you don't seem to understand is if you do not believe in the Muslim faith you are infidel period
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump Tell me more about your religion based on polygamy (of the living or the dead) a hat, two rocks, & mummy scrolls
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump NOT ONLY do I support Trump 100%, I think U r such a dismal failure that I'd vote for Kyrsten Sinema against U
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump the majority agrees with Trump ! #TrumpsRight
@JeffFlake Nope, but they definitely appeal to your base. What does that say about the GOP?
@JeffFlake @wpjenna - did he not catch wind of the #YouAintNoMuslimBruv ?
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump Does any of our Representatives use serious thought. They say he's inexperienced, well so was the foundingfather
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna You are right! Worton graduate at that - go figure! He is a master at dominating news cycle
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna he is not a politician. Thank god ! He says what everyone in Washington is thinking but won't say
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump Your lack of knowledge of the consequences of having mixed incompatible cultures =  serious information deficit
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna #Trump does not understand our #Constitution
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump because of ignorant low life ISIS ppl and ideas, we have to deal with comments like this from the free world
@JeffFlake Trump: "PUT ON THE BRAKES!" /You: "Nothing to see here. Move along. Don't worry, be happy." BS! // @realDonaldTrump
@JeffFlake @BryanDBender @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna They reflex what most Americans want but can't express what and how they fell
@JeffFlake @BryanDBender @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna Terrible spelling
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna he has affirmed he is a facist.  Also devoid of any interlect.
@JeffFlake What is your plan for ISIS?  Flowers?  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump Jeff. Thanks for the good point.I am a Muslim and I love this country. Americans go & live Muslim countries too.
@JeffFlake @blackrepublican @realDonaldTrump Well said.
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @Trump is just a@barking dog hungry for publicity.You don't bark back at a dog otherwise you would give it legit
@JeffFlake @blackrepublican @realDonaldTrump BS! HAVE you heard of san bern? We are being invaded ! Can you tell the difference betw goodbad
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @blackrepublican 
Jeff. We're coming for our country! And for our great state of Arizona. 
Trump 2016
@JeffFlake @kkalmes2 @realDonaldTrump oh my dear the sad reality is that they do.and his whipping up the very people Looney enough 2 believe
@JeffFlake @kkalmes2 @realDonaldTrump U do realize #JerryFalwellJr called for his zealot Christian followers to arm themselves at #LibertyU
@JeffFlake @kkalmes2 @realDonaldTrump #Falwell actually told his congregation they are holding classes on how to obtain concealed weapons
@JeffFlake @blackrepublican @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna The refugees don't want to be here - nor should they be.  They hate our infidel lives!
@JeffFlake @blackrepublican @realDonaldTrump Maybe we here in #Arizona should re think your current position and vote you out next election.
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump That's about all that needs to be said on this.
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna trump will win
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump Where were you Jeff on 9/11?
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump This hit was the first of many more to come. Every time you naysayers do this.  He becomes right.  Go Trump
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump Are you for real?  Listen buster.  We are at WAR.  In our history we have done this before.  Go to Iraq bud.
.@JeffFlake .@realDonaldTrump The Quran contains at least 109 verses that call Muslims to war with nonbelievers for the sake of Islamic rule
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump WWII America had labor camps for Japanese citizens... Modern America shelters ISIS supporters... #wtf TRUMP4PREZ
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @David_J_Bier 
What's weird is it was an actual release right? not just off the cuff?
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump Jeff Flake you are an amnesty hack. You created the backlash that you are now complaining about.
@JeffFlake @pmarca @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna Seriously Jeff you have never seen a  populist, this is every politician during election time
@JeffFlake @batchelorshow why I say we need 2 @kelliwardaz's in #Arizona one to run @SenJohnMcCain out and the other you.
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna we need this election to be over soon so that he shuts up and goes back to real housewives!
@JeffFlake @batchelorshow @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna 80% of Americans agree with him.
@IceDog07 Horse shit. @JeffFlake @batchelorshow @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna
@JeffFlake @ConservMemes @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna the era of political correctness must end now!
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @batchelorshow How anyone took him seriously at all is beyond me.
@JeffFlake @PoliticalLine @realDonaldTrump ...lmao..2 thoughts come to mind..Trump will never be the GOP nominee and  never be elected POTUS
@jeffflake @realdonaldtrump PROVING RECTUMS HAVE FUNCTIONING LIPS AND VOCAL CHORDS. BRAINS?
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna he is serious! That's was do frightening
@JeffFlake @MattWelch @realDonaldTrump Free nations and free people do, ultimately, get to decide immigration policies. Not immigrants.
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna A dictator in waiting. Republicans must wake up to the danger he poses.
@JeffFlake @MattWelch @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna Jeff Flake gets to define serious thought.
@JeffFlake @batchelorshow @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna so who was being polled in those hatred polls? Muslims or Trump fans?
@JeffFlake @pourmecoffee @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna that is the front runner in your primary, Senator.
. @JeffFlake why don't you run?
@JeffFlake @ConservMemes @realDonaldTrump It is absolutely serious thought if one is serious about protecting this country from known enemy
@JeffFlake @ConservMemes @realDonaldTrump I hope someone with real substance gets the GOP nomination like Rubio.
@JeffFlake @ConservMemes @realDonaldTrump
@JeffFlake @ConservMemes @realDonaldTrump immigration should be halted until security agencies can properly vet, no one has right to be here
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna I wish you were running for President instead of Trump.
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump what a despicable human being
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump 
Suddenly the Mexicans arent looking so bad eh Trump?
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump
 He didnt even write the press release. Look at the language. He doesn't use words over 5 letters long.
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump I'm with trump
@JeffFlake @husainhaqqani @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna trump is shockingly ignorant. Dont know whr world is heading to??
@JeffFlake Except I take it a step further & say Islam. The christians deserve to be in a Christian Nation. @DavidMDrucker @realDonaldTrump
@JeffFlake Your party's acceptance of hateful rhetoric got us to this place. As your constituent I'd love to see you make a stand against it
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna How does this not reflect serious thought? Most Muslims are peaceful, but some aren't & we don't know.
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump Are the Muslims going to be riding out of the country on the same busses as the Mexicans? Trump is insane.
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna http://www.thereligionofpeace.com   Educate yourself before you blindly comment.
@JeffFlake so how would you control Islamic terrorists?
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna Considering AZ is the epicenter of this type of thinking I don't believe a word
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna OK, this is a start. Where is everyone else in the GOP? Take a stand.
@JeffFlake @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump We know some of whom he wants to wall out.When does he spout re kick outs/walled in communities
@realDonaldTrump Wait. @JeffFlake didn't you vote for Loretta Lynch? Yep. You #TotalPussy
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna they don't assimilate.
JEFF FLAKE WILL BE VOTED OUT IN 2 YEARS . HE'S A LIBERAL LOSER .
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump  armed forces recruitment will be down dealing with this guy. Talking less is good thing donald
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump it is serious thought, sir.We need2emulate the period from 1924 to 1965, shut down immigration for assimilation!
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump. Damn trump  I'm sure folks cheering but you Just  up Isis recruitment couple thousand way go.
@JeffFlake @pourmecoffee "without looking at the data it is obvious that.." stopped there. reminds one of the circus barker in loud plaid.
@JeffFlake @Oooooo_Donna @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna if this is the real Sen Flake, thank you from a voting Arizonan!
@JeffFlake @David_Boaz @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna 

Islamic attacks in last 30 days across 30 countries. FACTS:
http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/index.html#Attacks …
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump It's serious thought to at least 30% of your party. You don't have a Trump problem, you have a base problem.
@JeffFlake, I think  @realDonaldTrump is on to something. Moslems hate, beer, football and America in general. Why do Moslems want to come?
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump 
Donald Trump should be banned from
The presidential campaign!!!!
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna thank you sir for condemning this!!
@JeffFlake @PoliticalLine @realDonaldTrump Jeff, you should have a talk with your voters in AZ. They back this sort of xenophobia.
@JeffFlake please urge others in your party to voice condemnation the way you have
@JeffFlake @pmarca @realDonaldTrump You offer too much credit. Trump doesn't engage sentient thought.
@JeffFlake @davidsirota @wpjenna the prob is some will take his words to heart. He's playing games w/American lives for polit gain. Horrid.
@JeffFlake How is @realDonaldTrump that different from "legitimate" #GOP contenders,like Cruz, Rubio? @pmarca
@danablankenhorn @JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @pmarca the same!!
@JeffFlake @pmarca @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna that's a bit extreme.  What would you critics do?  Journalists suck.
.@JeffFlake plz enlighten us with your serious thoughts abt HOW / IF you want to solve hijrah for jihad in USA @exjon @realDonaldTrump
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna what about the ones already here?  This is ridiculous.  #areyouforereal
@JeffFlake @pmarca @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna when does he say anything that reflects serious thought! Stop this nonsense. Where is Bachman
@JeffFlake Not fighting the war on radical islamic facism is not serious.  Our president doesn't even know how they got in the country.
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump how do you identify someone's faith anyway. It only exists in their head and heart. Interested in his theory..
@JeffFlake he's playing to his uneducated base. This is very dangerous. He's inciting people to violence. He must be called out. Unheard of
@JeffFlake @davidsirota @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna I don't think rational thought is a strength of his, or even a mild character trait.
@JeffFlake plan to move out, one less liberal is good for America
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump READ  HISTORY ABOUT OUR GOV DENIALS AND  THOUDANDS  of LIVES LOST BEFORE THEY TOOK BLINDERS OFF!! GO TRUMP
@JeffFlake @jogginsboy @realDonaldTrump Such a doodie.
@JeffFlake @pmarca  do you not trust our "glorious future leader" ? re-education camps will be necessary to teach ones of  your ilk !
@JeffFlake @wpjenna well said Senator, time to dump @realDonaldTrump #2016 #gop
@JeffFlake <-- WRONG!
100% support @realDonaldTrump's view. Until Muslims reform their religion, they are unfit to live in Western culture.
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna your party created the monster deal with it
@JeffFlake @MaxBoot @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna I'm heartened to see so many prominent Republican pols condemn this as quickly as they have.
@JeffFlake @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump 
Will you feel the same way after Muslims rape and behead your family ?
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna this man is dangerous to America and will make everything worse!
.@JeffFlake But if @realDonaldTrump were your party's nominee, would you vote for him?
@JonathanCohn @JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump Look, making policy based on unhinged xenophobic hatred is bad—but not as bad as higher taxes!!!!
@JonathanCohn @JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump Give the guy a break!
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @wpjenna 
Change parties
@JeffFlake @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump is this guy for real? If there's sth the world doesnt need right now is this kind of ignorance
@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump Then get GOP leadership and candidates to speak out!
