A horrific metaphor for Trumpcare: this disabled woman literally being ripped from her wheelchair. 
#StopTrumpcare  
Now's the time to pick country over party. Vote no on the healthcare bill
Don't vote for this disaster healthcare bill and be on the wrong side of history.
Anything has to be better rhan obamacare garbage!
I havent read the new bill nor the aca. The aca is a total farce. 1200 a month and 10000 deductible! Have to spend 24000 before any benefit
@Jeff you better PASS the healthcare bill !! We need to get rid of Obamacare
No on #Wealthcare
How much of the Healthcare bill have you read?  And what are your thoughts,
Vote no on ahca repeal and replace
Senator Flake please please don't pass this bill!!!I beg you sir..I pray God opens your eyes on this Please I beg you sir..I'm disabled 
Az voter here. Vote NO on that healthcare bill.
Tell us about your stance on the AHCA. That's your biggest task. Will you vote to destroy Medicaid? Throw the sick and poor to the floor?
Can't believe anyone who is a caring or moral human being would even consider this abomination of a healthcare bill. Please vote NO! #AHCA
Have you read the bill? Or do you just parrot dem party line?
Go away bot.
I am no bot. Just suffering under obamacare
Every time you tweet I get my hopes up that you are going to stand up for us on healthcare.
Do the right thing and vote no on the AHCA. I am an Arizona voter.
Sec Rick Perry is a former cheerleader with no qualifications & had no idea what his job even was.
I doubt this incompetent fool could find a nuke in silo let alone correctly identify fraud waste or abuse.
Well if your team is watching it we can be sure it's in control of Russia now.
I hope you do the right thing and vote NO on the healthcare bill. Millions will lose their insurance. We'll remember in 2018.
@JeffFlake  Now go and fix this healthcare plan! Stop and think about the people who are being harmed by this!  #Healthcarenottaxcuts
A commitment from Rick Perry and 3 bucks will get you a cup of coffee from @DunkinDonuts. #worthless
Yeah, right!

Good,  especially considering the Johnson,  Pierce, Norton mess here in AZ.  See,  regulation have oversight can be a good thing.
Sad that AZ & US legislative bodies are so corrupt and beholden to Koch & co. :'( #Wishing4Integrity
How did the reading of that bill go? We are waiting to hear from you! Don't screw America over !

Police drag away protesters, some in wheelchairs, outside of Sen. McConnell's office after draft of Senate health care bill is revealed 
This is shameful , vote NO on trump care.
No matter what you do about other issues, if you vote yes on the deadly healthcare bill you will not be re-elected. I am an AZ voter.
JEFF
HOW ARE YOU VOTING ON TRUMPCARE?
