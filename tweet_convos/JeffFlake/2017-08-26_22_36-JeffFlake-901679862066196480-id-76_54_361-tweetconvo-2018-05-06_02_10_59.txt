You are a disappointment.
TRAITOR
ouch really? I did not he was Mormon?
Republican set media on fire about Democrats shooting to kill congressman  or policeman rally around the president if not will vote you out
Graduated with Wil Cardom from Mesa Mountain View 1988. He is a great person-- class act all the way.
I came from a lower income fam and he from a high income. He was a young man that showed empathy. He was curious of my experiences/feeling
you will be voted out soon Flake. America has spoken. MCcain and you are Out.
Trump is clearly for us. You clearly are not   #maga > @gop

Get behind OUR president that WE elected or we will find someone else that will!
Seriously? You know we were gassed last week right?
IT DIDN'T HELP THAT YOU SLANDERED HIM IN THE LAST ELECTION...REMEMBER? THE ONE YOU LIED TO WIN...
Your new name - senator jackassery. Get used to it RINO

What a political atmosphere could create this despair.@JeffFlake
Nice to see two former opponents smiling together in a photo. As you think on Wil's life, think of yours. What will you have done for USA?
Wrong one passed. GB you Wil
You're no hero. You should denounce the MSM for radicalizing the left. #SHAME ON you. You Idly sit complicit while attacking @POTUS
20 people shot in NYC this weekend & Antifa beaten people again & no "white supremacist" strawman in site 4 political hacks to pander to MSM
Wil once showed tremendous emotional support for our family when we were going through a hard time. I honestly loved him. Stunned.

Your Invited Senator Flake.
Support our President
U were. We all saw the superhero demonstration in the dugout
Great picture. Great smiles. Great men. @SenFlakeStaff @JeffFlake thanks for posting
You're sick person! Great Will pic, Great Wil smile and Great man. I'm sorry we lost you Will. GB FLAKE take long run off a short pier!
To go thru that horror and not back the president is baffling. Born a flake.. Still a flake.
May his memory be eternal.
GOP to electorate-Can't do a thing without House. Done. Need Senate 2. Gotit. W/outOval or we're stuck. GOPprez! Still nothing. Dosomething!
So sad. No matter what your party, no matter what your socioeconomic status: Mental health is an issue that needs more attention.
BIG MONEY BACKERS AND U WON'T GIVE CONSTITUTANTS A DIRECT EMAIL ADDRESS-HAVE TO COMPLETE SOME FORM-GUESS U 4GET WHO THE BOSS IS
This is sad. Sorry for your and his familys loss
Very cool to show the world that life is too short for carrying grudges. Trolls this is not the place and it's disrespectful.
Just keep upsetting Trump and calling out the enablers of treason in what's left of the GOP, willya? Thanks!
Senator Flake, you are a class act.
You are right,  Just all low.
In regards to joe a how do you and traitor main keep getting elected? Not this time

Why don't u call it what it was, a Domestic Terrorist attack against real republicans? Of course that doesn't include #ClosetDem's like you.
U mean the lefts assassination attempt!  When u going to act like a republican???  Sending donation to your opponent!
Vote Flake Out of office!!!!!  #MAGA
Wil was a good guy, he will be missed
This flake stands with Antifa.  Vote Kelli Ward @kelliwardaz in the primary to boot this RINO out of office!
You would vote for a woman who thinks that John McCain is trying to blow her up with a car bomb? That is retarded.
True friends are tough to find. #Condolences
@Matt_Fox10 so sad .
Looking forward to @kelliwardaz kicking your traitorous ass in 2018! #VoteHimOut
And now you stand with -Antifa. Wow can't wait to vote you out!!!!
Condolences to family, friends, thanks @JeffFlake for kind words
And the point is what Brutus? If you're giving a story put some context to it.
Tepid Response means you are gone.
Uh, congratulations?
I think his point is "civility and decency." Whatever that's worth.
Dont get comfortable, 2018 isnt going to be good for you, traitor
Traitor Benedict Arnold unAmerican step down like a man nobody want you there
I don't dislike you just like @kelliwardaz more. Wil and I both have reasonable excuses to kill ourselves but @Eve629's @HDSA angels ...
And now you're making excuses FOR Antifa!?
If you're actually a representative then shame on you for this tweet.
You missed this in his bio?
Start looking for a new job. Flake is a snake for not supporting POTUS and the American people. MAGA 
Very sad!  

Truly sad. If only his faith could have thrown him a lifeline or more support. Pathetic loss of a life. @LDSchurch @ldsofficial
He sounds like a nice guy. We all know you're not!
Senator Flake, are you doing anything to help your conservative constituents regarding targeted internet censorship? @FlakeforSenate
But still voting for @kelliwardaz - drain the swamp
Sorry for your loss sir.
Really not the time or place, please show some respect for the Cardon family during this unimaginable difficult time!
All tact has been stripped from these man-children hiding behind social media accounts. It's pathetic.
So sorry to see that he died.  That is so sad.
