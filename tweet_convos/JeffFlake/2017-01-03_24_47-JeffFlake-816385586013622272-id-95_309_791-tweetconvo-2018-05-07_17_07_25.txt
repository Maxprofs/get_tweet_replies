@transition2017 Jeff Flake is a despicable establishment RINO. He WILL NOT get my vote in 2018. #Liar #senators #TrumpTrain
his willingness to serve?  What kind of response is that to your meeting??  What did you learn?  How cozy is he to Russia?
@transition2017
@transition2017 Flake is a fitting name.  Accurate!
ANother trouble maker #Flake, can't vote him out too soon. #DTS
@MyBrianLeyh He has the knowledge on how to put tje power of the USA into play.
As an Arizona voter, I'm appalled that you support #RexTillerson for #SecretaryOfState - known ties to Russia, not to be trusted.
supports the oil oligarchy. Don't forget that when it's time to vote
Jeff Sessions was too racist for the bench in the 80's. He's too racist for AG now. Do not confirm him.
Trump has picked a powerful team to  #MAGA. Ride with him and don't be swayed.
your are similar- corrupt officials
as an Arizona resident, I urge to  reconsider the conflict of interest between #RexTillerson and Russia. Please vote NO!
Please remember you are the senator for all your constituents both Dem and Repub..
Please withdraw your support for #Rexxon Tillerson due to Exxon's shameful environmental record and uber-close ties to Putin

@realDonaldTrumpShiite gangs do not differentiate between one All have a US enemy or a Sunni or Shiite Snary unless it be

is that @KatTimpf @ door?
@transition2017. For the v haters ..
JeffFlake is a traitor
I hope you have some pointed questions and go all the way or exposing his views. Hopefullyhis  answers and not muddy.
it's time to drain you from the swamp. You have no interest in saving America. You only want more for yourself. #Resistance
Trump has the keys to the car and many countries are afraid of him coz he does not know  how to drive. Big bully.
I don't see negotiations just 'do this or we walk' attitude Iran deal was multilateral not just us.
given the chance most want to serve their country. Do u really think he is good for USA? Deal maker not negotiator.
Are you willing to #VoteNo
good meeting with Putins pal and the guy who undermines American interest for personal profit? How much $ is going in ur pocket?
If Tillerson sells us down the river, it will cost you.
C'mon Jeff let's do this right. Counting on you to be fair and also to be thorough. Do your job without influence.
disappointed in you, but you won't care
UGH. Sickening.
your losing your lustre.The Trump effect.
What a Flake!!
ask him tough questions about #Putin
As an Arizonian, I'm asking you to vote no here and to account for the conflict of interests.
please don't support Tillerson due to his Russian ties and his company's fracking business.
Make sure to ask about his investments and Russian connections!
You need to get Trump on the same page.
Hope you know what you're doing, Jeff.  If Tillerson screws up, you'll lose in the next election.
Please do NOT vote to confirm this oil baron, Senator Flake. The people and your planet need you to say no to Tillerson as SoS.
did he address the Kremlin in the room that are his conflicts with Russia?
Wow! People tell me you are a good Senator. Now you will be voted against in 2018. You are part of the swamp. #theresistance
NO unless you want to learn to speak Russian.
Really? At least show some concern over Russia or back up @SenJohnMcCain.  Oh & I live in AZ don't count on my vote in 18.
mcamnesty is joke and should be in communist(dems) party
You MUST ask hard questions re: conflict of interest. Your constituents (including me) are watching this process very closely.
As long as he knows he cannot push for removing sanctions from Russia.
he's a poor choice
Don't forget you're working FOR THE PEOPLE..
