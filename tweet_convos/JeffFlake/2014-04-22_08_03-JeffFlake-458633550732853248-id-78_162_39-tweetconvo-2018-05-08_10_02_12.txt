@SpeakerBoehner @EWErickson Yes. how is this even a question? has Boehner been drinking again?
@SpeakerBoehner
@SpeakerBoehner I have a lot of need for #perdistrict allotments, but theyre usually mainstage. #makeitrain
@SpeakerBoehner @EWErickson There should be only one item in a bill! A single bill hides nothing!  No #pork hidden! No earmarks#!
@SpeakerBoehner if you have to ask this question, then please resign your seat now.
@SpeakerBoehner Not all ear marks were wasted projects. Some very effective programs were eliminated in the global ban.
@SpeakerBoehner yes but i think ALL earmarks including those you favor.
@SpeakerBoehner ..YES...
@SpeakerBoehner @EWErickson Taking the Senate in 2014 or the White House in 2016! We conservatives will stay home! We want enforcement
@SpeakerBoehner Keep #earmark ban in place. AND BAN BASELINE BUDGETING
@SpeakerBoehner NO Amnesty NO earmarks NO pork and NO to renewUI  sick of lazy people mooching off the working class. Get a job & pay UR way
@SpeakerBoehner @EWErickson its Not like the Repubs care about what Americans want anyway. Their heads r stuck up the Media's A**

@SpeakerBoehner @EWErickson Yes! And you might try enforcing immigration laws on the books! I can tell you if you pass amnesty, you aren't
@SpeakerBoehner I assume you have a earmark pet project but need to bribe your flock with our tax dollars for their earmark pet projects

@SpeakerBoehner #dumbass #NOAMNESTY 
What did does it make? We need a real conservative as Speaker!
Vote this idiot out of office!
@SpeakerBoehner @EWErickson yes. Dem r "liberating" adults from being adults by forcing them to move back in with parents. LOL
@SpeakerBoehner @EWErickson if Repubs do Amnesty they wont take Senate in 2014. duh
@SpeakerBoehner @EWErickson Americans must move back in with parents cause economy sucks WHILE Dems focus on illegal immigrants jobs
@SpeakerBoehner @EWErickson i hope the  Dems do Run on ObamaCare & Blame Repubs for everything. They're Soooo Stupid. LOL
@SpeakerBoehner @EWErickson Dems r planning on using Women More than they do now instead of focusing on the economy. LOL
Didn't realize there was a ban. There SHOULD BE. Let a bill pass/fail on its own. @SpeakerBoehner @bettymowery
@SpeakerBoehner No bill should be longer than the Constitution and should state in the bill, where it is authorized in the Constitution.
@SpeakerBoehner why give all the power to the President?  #consiliogroup
@SpeakerBoehner yes
@SpeakerBoehner The Majority Of The People Want To Extend UI, Medicare, The American Jobs Act,Jobs For Vets But The GOP Says No WHY ?
@SpeakerBoehner I read you support "immigration reform." Last year the government gave 1,500,000 immigrants work permits. No reform needed.
@SpeakerBoehner ok, i #want #more #choices #sir. cause < effect. i know you have a voice too. you are listening to the people. #whatsyourOP?
@SpeakerBoehner Instead of worthless tweets, do something useful like #HoldPOTUSaccountable or #ElectnewSpeaker #ccot #tcot @HouseGOP
@SpeakerBoehner Yes, the ban should remain
@SpeakerBoehner All we want to hear from you is #RenewUI
@SpeakerBoehner no I dont agree, earmarks were jobs programs, it put people to work. I was a way to bring tax dollars back home. #RenewUI
@SpeakerBoehner What I agree on is that #ImmigrationReform would cut billions on our defecit in a 10 yrs. span & would help the economy.
@SpeakerBoehner RENEW UI! Millions of Americans are suffering and it will put more $ into economy! GOP is fiscally irresponsible and immoral
@SpeakerBoehner we also have to work on reducing TAXES! Between federal, SS, and local and property taxes I'm paying almost 50%. Ridiculous!
@SpeakerBoehner you want to exercise your authority? Demand DOJ, an IRS turnover requested documents or have their budgets pulled. Spineless
@SpeakerBoehner @EWErickson Why do you bother asking? You're gonna do what you want anyways, like on amnesty.  Kill amnesty or go away.
More important question: Should we keep @SpeakerBoehner in place? #Benghazi @EWErickson
@SpeakerBoehner End Crony Capitalism:  http://thekronies.com  #earmarks
@SpeakerBoehner bring back earmarks...congress should know how to spend locAlly not bureaucrats
@SpeakerBoehner Do you agree Spk Boehner is a political terrorist? RT yes. Favorite no. Do nothing, Yet.
@SpeakerBoehner YEs To Earmarks, No #Amnesty, No #Payraise ,
@SpeakerBoehner you have outspent Palosi's congress by double, an bent over to the executive to the point you are irrelevant.
@SpeakerBoehner immigration reform
@SpeakerBoehner $500M 2 hollywood in that fiscal cliff deal alone is an earmark sir.How much did Mitch get for his damn?word games,semantics
@SpeakerBoehner Does it really matter? Do you people do anything besides vote on Obamacare?
@SpeakerBoehner I think your party needs to reinstate UI for millions instead of worrying about the millions you'll make off the pipeline
@SpeakerBoehner yes!!
@SpeakerBoehner earmark ban? Hilarious, you guys have been jamming the pork into huge omnibus bills while feigning fiscal responsibility
@SpeakerBoehner I agree that the House should vote to #RenewUI
@SpeakerBoehner No amnesty of any sort! No new immigration.
@SpeakerBoehner What diff does an #earmarks ban do? You guys still do it anyway! You never listen to us!
@SpeakerBoehner Really, John? USA middle class poorer than Canadians now. Soon 2 B behind England. YOU LIE: "#jobs #1". #WorstSpeakerEver
@SpeakerBoehner Sir, have a great day, many people need you. I hope my Lord touches your heart.
@SpeakerBoehner I would rather you ban pork which is the real problem. Earmarks just direct the spending you are doing.
@speakerboehner No #Amnesty
