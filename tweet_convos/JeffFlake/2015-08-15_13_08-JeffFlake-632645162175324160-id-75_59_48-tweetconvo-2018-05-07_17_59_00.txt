@JeffFlake the junior senator comes out against knowledgeable scientists and the UN Security Council.  But Sen Flake doesn't like facts.
@ActorAaronBooth  Who's experts ? The islamonazi 's . I'll side wit America.
@PeterdiPierro Well the 29 that penned this letter are all Americans:
@ActorAaronBooth Leftists.
@PeterdiPierro fascinating, scientists and the UN are "leftists."  I imagine you don't go to the doctor because medicine is science.
@ActorAaronBooth the UN is comprised of tyrannical dictatorships, and leftists hate America . Bet you believe in Global warming too..
@PeterdiPierro I accept the overwhelming evidence and consensus in the scientific community.
@ActorAaronBooth my half of the scientific community says the other half is full of shit. Are they lying or "Brilliant" actors ?
@JeffFlake @SecureAmerica  Why is it that the President is so determined to send $150B to Iran while at same time helping them go nuclear?
@AH44KS @JeffFlake @SecureAmerica   I guess this must have hit pretty close to home for someone to get so emotional about that question.
@JeffFlake Thank u 4 opposing the terrible IranDeal &not being bullied by @WhiteHouse & @POTUS who r trying 2 paint dissenters as warmongers
@JeffFlake

You had 2 choices:

1 enable Iran to fast track a bomb + no sanctions
or
2 rigorously enforce #JCPOA

You FLUNKED

cc @POTUS @VP
@Our4thEstate @Quicksilver2723 @JeffFlake @POTUS @VP Another coward. Didn't he also vote against the Newtown kids.
@angelwryter @Our4thEstate @Quicksilver2723 @JeffFlake Deal is a JOKE! For starters, Iran will build its first nukes in N Korea/elsewhere.
@Al_the_Plumber @angelwryter @Our4thEstate @JeffFlake So I noticed that there's 238 people out there as paranoid as  yourself. Get help.
@Quicksilver2723 @Al_the_Plumber @Our4thEstate @JeffFlake Rejection to #IranDeal is ALL abt $$ from mil ind complex to the Saudis. Greed!
@angelwryter @Al_the_Plumber @Our4thEstate @JeffFlake Well, and the plummeting barrel prices of oil. oops.
@Quicksilver2723 @Al_the_Plumber @Our4thEstate @JeffFlake Yep. The energy industry losing $$. Why they shut down refinery in Chicago area.
@JeffFlake thank you for your thoughtful analysis. Please stand firm.
@JeffFlake as usual, Flake is on the wrong side, just like the gun background checks that he lied about. This guy needs to go.
@Mtngoat62 youre worried about background checks on legal gun purchases that dont effect criminals but u hav no prob with Iran having nukes?
@Sonny_6411 Huh?
@Mtngoat62 politics aside. Ur ok with Iran being able to acquire a nuke? Do their own insp. n require 24 days notice of our insp?
@Mtngoat62 ur so worried about gun violence y not address the real issue? Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit etc? Any plans in disarming them??
W created SHIITE superstate w/IRAQ WAR! SHIITES run IRAQ, allied w/IRAN BIG TIME! Destabilized MID-EAST! Ignored IRAN NUKES @JeffFlake
@JeffFlake would have been so much easier if you just said Obama's for it I'm against it
@JeffFlake No backbone Flake, shame on you.  There's no way to explain this away, you caved to politics.
@JeffFlake not about in nuke deal;we've already too much problem in the region. ıran pushes m.east region to conflict w/ their policies
@JeffFlake Thank you!!!
@JeffFlake Sir, please outline an alternative?  Given our sanction partners were ready to pull out?
Disappointed with @JeffFlake. Had high hopes to see support on #IranDeal from the GOP's most reasonable senator.
@MattyIceAZ @NormanPenny @JeffFlake
@JeffFlake good senator you'll get my vote next time you are up for reelection
@RarefiedLevin @JeffFlake Deal is a JOKE! Just for starters, Iran will build its first nukes in N Korea/elsewhere. Inspections mean ZERO!
@JeffFlake Really bad decision on your part, factually unsupported. http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/breaking-nuclear-stuff-really-complicated …
@JeffFlake Has anyone asked Israel how many hundred nuks are aimed at Iran?
They are the only one with defense missiles. Make a trip to Iran
@JeffFlake you've made @AIPAC proud! #ChaChing
@JeffFlake your lengthy and final "too little too late" opposition to a dangerous deal makes suspect your judgement to protect us Americans,
@JeffFlake you keep my vote!!
U a SMART MAN !!! Go Jeff. !! NO ON IRAN !! U must have grand kids. !!
Thank you Sen @JeffFlake. Hoping to read similar statements from Sens @CoryBooker, @clairecmc and @BenCardinforMD this week on #BadIranDeal
@JeffFlake Thank you! Your position to oppose the #BadIranDeal is greatly appreciated. @AIPAC @ADL_National
.@JeffFlake who's kids are you sending to die , not yours I'll bet. You warmongers never do.
@Mama4Obama1 @JeffFlake Deal is a JOKE! Just for starters, Iran will build its first nukes in N Korea/elsewhere. Inspections mean ZERO!
@JeffFlake http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/03/opinion/bazzi-iran-iraq/ … You are dangerously reckless. U need better explain yourself; your boring is overcome by your ambiguity.
@JeffFlake Sorry you're on wrong side of history, Jeff. I understand tough to go against the party line. Most experts say it prevents NUKES
@JeffFlake Very disappointed, sir

If no deal, they can build it within a year. Then we have to decide whether it's worth going to war over
@JeffFlake Thank you for standing with Israel and colleagues against #IranNuclearDeal
@JeffFlake Disappointing.
TY for a vote Sen @JeffFlake but remember "Hoping that Iran’s nuclear ambitions might change after a fifteen year sabbatical" IS NOT sane.
@JeffFlake GOD BLESS YOU! U R DOING THE CORRECT THING BY VOTING NO. THE AMER PPL/YOUR CONSTITUENTS ARE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU.
@JeffFlake $119350 worth of Israeli Pac Money bought your vote?
@JeffFlake Most AMERICANS don't love war and are not bought by Israel clearly you are one who kisses the feet of Netanyahu.
@JeffFlake Wrong decision on #IranDeal. Show courage and reconsider.
@JeffFlake You've missed the point of what #IranDeal is framed to do.Its a Non Proliferation agreement It never was meant to change behavior
@JeffFlake :  Also wanted to share this w/you sir...let's hope #vote4peace is something all can strive for....
@JeffFlake FYI: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/world/29-us-scientists-praise-iran-nuclear-deal-in-letter-to-obama.html?_r=0 …
@JeffFlake Thank you for doing the right thing for U.S.
@JeffFlake For the life of me, I don't even know how you could have considered this deal on its face? You're make the right decision, though
@JeffFlake you should support pres and support deal.  You and your party make  our country look ridiculous to the world.   THIS IS THE DEAL!
@JeffFlake The deal isn't strong: it's a JOKE! Just for starters, Iran will build its1st nukes in N Korea/elsewhere. Inspections mean ZERO!
@JeffFlake Without the deal, we have 0 leverage. What's your alternative solution? Please, read about 1953 and what WE did to Iran then.
@pang5 @JeffFlake Deal isn't strong. It's a JOKE! For starters, Iran will build its first nukes in N Korea/elsewhere. Inspections mean ZERO!
@Al_the_Plumber @JeffFlake So, again I ask - what is your alternative solution?
@JeffFlake wrong on Iraq, wrong on the #IranDeal. Give peace a chance.
@JeffFlake Obama had such high hopes for you I wonder why? #RINODUNG Switch parties you look like a dem pos
@JeffFlake 
No need Senator. Sheeeeeeesh!
'Nuff said.
@InsanityFairMag @JeffFlake Deal is a JOKE! Just for starters, Iran will build its first nukes in N Korea/elsewhere. Inspections mean ZERO!
Senator @JeffFlake's Statement in Opposition to #IranDeal http://www.flake.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=706580a3-7b69-46c2-bd9a-8ada726d5925#.Vc_m3BidCPI.twitter …
@JeffFlake  You too want Iran war.Tell your kids to get ready to fight in Iran. Good luck to them.@TheIranDeal
@JeffFlake 
Thank you!!
@JeffFlake As your constituent I am extremely disappointed in your opposition to the #IranDeal . Will you send you kids to fight in Iran?
@JeffFlake coward
@JeffFlake "B4 we c more my bro & sistrs in uniform medivaced away from combat zone let's support diplomacy & the Iran Deal." Votevets.
@Al_the_Plumber @JeffFlake then you haven't read the agreement just spouting right wing talking poinits
@JeffFlake Im sorry an ad made you change your mind.
@JeffFlake Thank You, the #IranDeal is a #EpicFail that will end in disaster - as would any deal with a party that can’t be trusted.
@ChiefPoints @JeffFlake Deal is a JOKE! Just for starters, Iran will build its first nukes in N Korea/elsewhere. Inspections mean ZERO!
Thanks, Senator.  Know decision didn't come easy, but the JCPOA just doesn't square w/stated US goals. @JeffFlake: http://www.flake.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=706580a3-7b69-46c2-bd9a-8ada726d5925 …
@JeffFlake Thank you, Senator Flake.
@JeffFlake American lives thank you.
@JeffFlake That's too bad. Impeaching Bill Clinton was a party line vote, so was the Health Care bill & so will this Nuke Freeze agreement.
@JeffFlake  Please send your kids to the front line in case of a war you stupid warmonger. #SupportIranDeal
Glad you came to your senses @JeffFlake .
Still, I won't ever vote for you again. #NoIranDeal
@JeffFlake not at all surprised you got in line with the rest of the pro-war right
@JeffFlake Solid deliberation, even if I'm disappointed with the outcome. Thanks for being a Senator any American can respect.
@craig_montuori @JeffFlake 
Huh!
