If Trump is against you, you're doing something right.

We'll be happy to see you go next year

Vote repeal on ACA -  then replace - and get to th3e budget
Why can't you repeal obamacare?????   This is disgusting, we voted you in to do this, What the hell are you doing?????
Coincidentally,if the ACA is repealed/not replaced, the federal deficit will increase $137B b/w 2016-2025(GAO). Only an idiot would vote yes
you could of been a new proud republican, but you chickened out. associating with cheeto is career ending. You should of been the 3rd for no
Start packing. You're OUT!
This liberal Republican have to be repeal next year
Russian Bot account Blocked
Wow, $137 billion, from $20 TRILLION. LOLOLOLOLOL
Who cares national debt is good
If you do not pass full repeal of Obamacare you're a liar and a coward.
This is a dumb idea. Audit the Pentagon and the Federal Reserve Banking System if you want to locate waste!
here is a fact check for you 2018 you will be receiving your pink slip
Looks like healthcare is dead, thank goodness.  But you did NOTHING to support your constituents. It's bad for AZ and the people you serve.
Trump, @SpeakerRyan, @SenateMajLdr have no moral standard with regards toRussian interests, or our heathcare. #VoteNo and be a hero!
I think he's too cowardly to buck the party line. Even with Trump threatening to help oust him in the primary. He & McCain put party first.
Jeff....don't let him scare you....he will be long gone one way or another before u r
A lot of people are saying Trump's main source of revenue is money laundering criminal Russian oligarchs monies. Could that be true?
#NEVERRepeal
Oh, man! Flacid Face Turtle ACTUALLY going to run "the bus off the cliff and see if anyone knows how to fly it!  https://twitter.com/HuffPost/status/887163088033722372 …
When you claim the debt "cripples" or harms the economy, do you, a Senator, not know that's bunk or do u know it's bunk and say it anyway?
Nice one Jeff! 32 million uninsured with ur plan instead of 24 million. Make America sick again.
No more Crap  healthcare bills @gop will FAIL. It's simple: People don't want to die!
As long as you try to gut Medicaid (after PROMISING you wouldn't touch it!) and rob veterans, children, and other Americans, YOU WILL FAIL!
We could stop wasting money on out of control defense spending and reallocate the funds to paying down debt and building infrastructure
Yeah but that's because essential services would suffer. Why not just reduce spending?
If you can't/won't listen for medical maybe you can help my SSA disability so I maybe could afford to get insurance. What do you think....
Senator, may i have chance to tell my story for Medicaid. I am aged,mutiple disability,ex-20 year Az state DES worker, can't Ford medical.
This is everything 
You and your heartless GOP cronies need to realize that people aren't willing to die or go bankrupt from medical issues!
Please vote no Republican healthcare. Vote No !
How dumb and cowardly is Flake? He's 'unsure' on his vote on simply repealing without replacement. Tells you everything you need to know
Be a leader and ingratiate yourself with Arizonans: Ask and Demand Trump to release his tax records. America must know origin of his riches.
Debtbuydown act sounds great according to what u say. We want to see the writing of the act.
Drop in the bucket
777.bill.electric@gmail.com..  I feel you or 12News may find story News worthy. Aged, disabled,on intermit-FMLA, enrolled w/DES-RSA & termed
Your finished! No need to change the subject like a 2 yr old before the whipping
Cut the $601+ billion that is spent on military. Stop fighting wars to prop up our economy under the guise of defense.

Hey, @JeffFlake -- Trump is going to turn on you anyway. You know this.
Do the right thing.

An interesting bill, I suppose. Please don't take away my health care. Also, best of luck with three three primary challengers.
Kudos to Senators Lee and Moran. @JeffFlake Why would you think the Cruz amendment would work with AZ seniors, which are a large contingent?
I would have loved the news more if it were you.
Wow! Dear Senators @JerryMoran & @SenMikeLee you're both on the right side of history. Respect.#HealthcareBill #Medicare4All https://twitter.com/jerrymoran/status/887107267824406528 …
Hey @JeffFlake , I bet you are worried tonight after reading @politico article abt @potus trying 2 support one against you.

Please be a hero and save our healthcare. #SaveMedicaid #aca. Kill the bill, wealthy tax cut horrible healthcare. @GOP $10mill against u Sad
What about the fact checks & #CBO report on how TERRIBLE #Trumpcare will hurt AZ vets, seniors and families? Do the right thing! #VoteNoBCRA
how's it feel to have Trump and the @HouseGOP turn against you?
What about the reduce military spending act?
But I thought the deficit only grew under Obama?!
Since when do you care about fact-checking? Your support of the Cruz amendment in spite of obvious ramifications show you don't.
Seriously? U want to destroy ACA for tax cuts for 1%, tax reform for the 1%, and now want taxpayers to pay debt CAUSED by 1%. Not happening!
but your cut taxes $7.8 Trillion to give tax breaks to the super wealthy
Putting the onus on the tax paying Americans to pay down the debt is ludicrous. What kind of leadership is this?????
Good BYE Flake! You will be known as the guy that took away pre existing conditions and healthcare away.
Good news, now please multitask and don't give Trump a political win at the risk of our healthcare. He doesn't care.-AZ resident & veteran.
He's not getting re-elected so I could care less about this greedy politician.
HEALTHCARE!!! Your vote is needed help defeat TRUMPCARE.
That's rich coming from someone that has American flag upside. #shame
Are you a treasonous putin puppet,too? Our nation is in distress.
How? Or is that just something that you are feeble mind was told sheep. #CNNVERYFAKENEWS
This administration has committed treason, lies constantly, is corrupt, destroying your healthcare and our standing in the world. Shame on u
Do the right thing for AZ Senator.  VOTE NO on #wealthcare You will be a hero #TrumpRussiaCollusionConfirmed
I think @JeffFlake has a real opportunity here.

The White House has met with potential Flake challengers http://politi.co/2u0UvWo 
If you ppl in Washington we careful over the last 40 years we WOULDN'T BE AT 20 TRILLION DEBT.
This Trumpcare bill is immoral. It will hurt the sick and disabled. Please work with all sides to fix the issues with the ACA.
Did you get the GOP support?
How about the Democrats'?

taking Healthcare from millions is a great way to reduce US debt! Don't forget the top 1%, big donors, need tax relief!!!
What's the real cost to veterans and really poor people?
sorry Flake you are like the rest can not govern are you like TJ can not read or research past the subject line Vote the Flake out 2018
So we'll just use local news orgs' analyses instead of the @USCBO whenever it fits your @GOP aims right?
