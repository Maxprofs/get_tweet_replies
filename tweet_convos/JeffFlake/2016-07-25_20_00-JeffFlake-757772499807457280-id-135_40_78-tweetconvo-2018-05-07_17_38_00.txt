You're free to try to prove her wrong! @dennis_welch @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump
Not a sacrifice..but

Your name is soooo fitting. FLAKE!
Looks like never. See #TrumpSacrifices trending all day!

.@JeffFlake Are you aware of any sacrifices he's made? If yes, please share. Thanks.
.@elizabethforma says @realDonaldTrump "Has never sacrificed anything for anyone." Never? Anything? Anyone? C'mon.
@elizabethforma What have you accomplished? NY Ice Rink is 1ex he completed for whole families not for profit for ppl
You're better than this. You know @realDonaldTrump is a taker and not a giver. Def not 1 to sacrifice anything.
Great to see that Flake has integrity and speaks up to this truth
sometimes he hires people instead of firing them #TrumpSacrifices
Name things he's sacrificed-as @elizabethforma is referencing the Khan's remarks. C'mon Jeff.
Hey Flake hitch your wagon to Trump's and go down the tubes with him! #TrumpSacrifices
Really.He doesn't even pay taxes,which funds our military.Unpatriotic!If Hillary did the same?
One time, even though Gary Busey was away, Trump putted first. #TrumpSacrifices
One time, even though Gary Busey was away, Trump putted first. #TrumpSacrifices

Parsing once, maybe, for a lifetime is a losers apology for failure.
.@JeffFlake @BrianPaulStuart @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump He did walk across a highway median once to enter a hotel through the back.
@BrianPaulStuart @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump ok. Sacrificed his KKK meetings.
Do the right thing Flake. You know what that is. You r a decent man. Hx will remember
Stay out of this one,  @JeffFlake.  You've been reasonable thus far.  Don't spoil that.
#Trump sacrificed having sex with his daughter to run for press
The goats he's sacrifced to his demonic overlord don't count.
What sacrifices has he made?  Not dating his daughter?
I read this as a challenge, knowing that no one would back Trump up. #crickets
Don't play stupid..you aren't any good at it.  You know what me meant by sacrifice.....
#structures sad, pathetic structures.
If you know of stuff we don't, then please feel free to share. Otherwise shut the hell up please
@SikhsForTrump @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump ha ha ha Jeff. Pack your bags.
what you didn't read his own explanation. He created JOBS!  Not a sacrifice?
Trump's sons sacrifice endangered animals all the time.  Does that count?
He sacrificed the dignity of running for prez by insulting the Khan family.  #TrumpSacrifices
Don sacrificed a bogus speech writer to make Malania look good on national tv.  #TrumpSacrifices
.@JeffFlake go ahead, name one, Jeff.
Unfortunately, your party nominated a sociopath. Sociopaths don't sacrifice
C’mon @JeffFlake - I’m a constituent and respected your (former) stand. If DT can’t name the sacrifice ?
Name one.
1. Name one then 2. All your scummy  tweets need this type of bullshit literalist scrutiny. Fun!
. Never. Nothing. No one.  You know that.
You're free to point us in the direction of these sacrifices as soon as you can invent some
Is this you HRC endorsement?
He kindly draft-dodged Vietnam so that I could have a spot over there.  Thanks, Donald.
You should know the context before defending the disgusting piece of human waste AKA Trump.
.@JeffFlake A single counterexample would suffice to disprove the claim. And that counterexample is?
Sorry; meant to respond to Flake's tweet those two times!
Word @elizabethforma
Has the Clinton's ever sacrificed anything? They have robbed America and sold us out,IDIOT
Be specific Flake. Make a list and let us know about her sacrifices. Ball is in your court.
Nancy says it nicely. Keep your shoulder to the wheel Senator!
so name some of @realDonaldTrump sacrifices then
please show the same courage you had for John McCain and voice your opinion about Trump's request to Russia to hack emails.
he has always been part of our nations tragedies & triumphs - anonymously or front & center
he is sacrificing his safety, family, golden years, feelings and so much more to give back 2 USA
can you name one or just scoff? 
spoken as a master debater
TURNCOAT FLAKE! You had your chance to support a WINNER like Donald. Too late! Voting you out after this term!
Is she joking? Really?
what are u going to do when Trump wins. Lol you're done Flake. You are a flake
Flake=Someone that shows off, and vanishes when needed. Lock Her Up!! Lock Her Up!! Lock Her Up!
Examples, Jeff? Specifics?
You question the statement, but you still have no answer.  'Cause the answer is "NEVER!"
Why haven't you endorsed Trump? Could it be you have some things in common with HELLARY? Support Trump or forget me!!!
prove it pasted on smile.
then name one/thing other than his own $$$$$
only cares about himself. Why do you think he doesn’t pay a lot of his subs? Mnfctrs his clothing overseas? etc?
And what have you ever sacrificed for this Country?
Well Mr. Flake, give some examples if you KNOW he has.
@MacandGaydos @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump lol neither has most politicians. Trump fits right in.
"Never"
@Jason_Samuels @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump That is awfully close to a pro-Trump tweet...
for himself, sure.
I would have probably added in addition to his family which by the way is a smoking hot family:)
Obviously employing thousands of diverse individuals is "nada" in Warren's book. She's a joke!
That's right. Never.
Yes Jeff we all know you are ready to bend over for trump the day he gets in office. Luckily it won't happen
right, because slight exaggeration on a point like that is the real crime.
I hear a thundering silence.
Has he? Citations/Examples? Genuinely interested..

Donald Trump Helps Little Girl with Bone Disease #Cancer #Obamacare

Ok Sen Flake.What has he sacrificed 4 anyone?U decry her hyperbole but are unable 2 offer an eg
Sen Flake , does supporting Trump make you feel dirty? I bet it does. It's OK, he won't win.
Seriously, Senator, you are in the wrong party. Can you honestly say you're proud of the GOP?
... Wait a minute ... Her hyperbole upsets you but you're not bothered by "Lock Her Up"?

He once ate a taco

What do you consider a sacrifice?

perhaps no one without the Trump name would be more accurate
Yes, NEVER. Take off your red-colored glasses.
I'm sure he did it once or twice
