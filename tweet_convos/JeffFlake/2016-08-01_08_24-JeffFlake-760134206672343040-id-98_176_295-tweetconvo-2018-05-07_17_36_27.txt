CFR globalist puppets. If U want 2 know who someone is just look at the company they keep.
Main stream media interviews you to promote Clinton and defeat Republicans. If Trump loses, its your fault.
@WaPoSean McCain and you both fell for the Democrats trap! Are you really that stupid?
You are doing a great job in electing @HillaryClinton .She, her husband, and daughter are grateful.
@WaPoSean Jeff Flake... The name says it all...
If Hillary wins, it will be your fault. We will lose our country, but you will still have your power.  traitor.
@washingtonpost Sen. mccain please quote what Trump said you take issue with.
The lying dirty trick McCain is a disgrace to the republican party. He should have never won that primary.
@washingtonpost Would be nice if u guys would stand up for us in the USA.Not call out Trump 4 exposing the Truth?
@washingtonpost So u understand Trump never said anything other  than acknowledge his son a hero.The dad is hack!
@washingtonpost
And a broad array of the American public backs Trump.
Maybe 'SongBird' McCain who was pardoned by Pres. Nixon should do a little research on Khan who prefers Shari
Someone needs to say it. You guys are not doing anything in DC. Both of you OUT OF OFFICE $vote
@washingtonpost jeff why don't you go join the democratic part you establishment hack.
mcC is so stupid he dropped bombs on his own ship. Chk out daddy Khan's writings on sharia & U.S. constitution.
disavow him, show your true courage&state U will NOT vote for him. Nor should anyone else!!
When the Khans threw their hat n rhetoric into the political arena, THEY BECAME FAIR GAME - IM VOTING WARD
Both of you need to find another job. Please stop the double talk and either help or get out of office.
@washingtonpost but ur still endorsing & voting 4 him so in the end u still condone him insulting our Military.
2 Jokes @JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain
McCain is another life long politician, sucking off America (like Flake wants to be) Time to get McCain OUT
STOP supporting #NeverTrump. You know how dangerous an ignorant person in the WH could be.
@WaPoSean Speaking of Sen. McCain, I recommend this read.
@WaPoSean blindly backing trump will cost you your seat. Are you a GOP & republican drone, I'm  proud repub @cnn
hey did you dudes figure out yet that Khan was a plant?  That his son would be embarrassed he sells citizenship?
when U disavow him-I'll then vote 4 u.  if not, forget it.
Ur silence 2 denounce ConTrump as unfit 4 @POTUS is also how another tyrant came 2 power: https://youtu.be/FGVBn_3EjmE 
much respect for you for having a backbone and putting country before party.  Now time to take a stance. A "no vote" helps Trump.
@washingtonpost shut up John, your time has come to step aside and let new blood lead the country! Out of touch!!
Not even close to condemning Trump.  More concerned about reelection than the country. Do the right thing for once
.@JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain when will you renounce the Trump candidacy?
@WaPoSean You are a sellout.  I am also a VFW.  I fully support Trump.  Khan is a disgrace.
@WaPoSean it would have been better said if it included a renunciation of his endorsement.
@WaPoSean the sane, honest and experience choice this election!
Well said, but hollow and self-serving.. he still endorses Trump who represents and speaks for his party.
it will be interesting to see if the Pro-Russia Republican party still has a hope. #countryfirstpartynext
you, sir are making a fool of yourself. And no I'm #notwithher
take your own advise and do better than attacking someone who put his life on the line for you
@politico @Reuters Thank U 4 pushing back 2 ConTrump. America please wake up 2 fraud Trump. Country over politics!
@CNN @CBSNLive Thank U 4 pushing back 2 ConTrump. America please wake up 2 fraud Trump. Country over politics!
is only on TV because he is a Trump hater.  Goof
@WaPoSean some of us already jumped off of the Trumptrain & found sanity in #JohnsonWeld
@washingtonpost Jeff u seem such like a decent fellow, please do not let Trump destroy the party. Its happening
so glad mccain is losing his reelction nuts and out of touch flakes like flake and him need to retire
@WaPoSean Mr Flake...Trump said U N V E T T E D people! Not a BAN ON MUSLIMS! A ban on those that are UNVETTED
The GOP should give up on the Donald while they still have a shred of decency.
Mr McCain, please #DumpTrump
Not saying whom which candidate I prefer, but Mr Trump took political jabs at you Mr McCain like you at him?  @JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain
Not saying for whom I am voting for, but didn't Mr Kahn allow himself to be vulnerable in the political arena? @JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain
and yet you're still supporting Trump's candidacy, last I heard....
McCain is still endorsing Trump for president. I will never vote for anyone who does. Glad you still haven't.
#neverhillary
Are you planning on voting? Are you even REGISTERED to vote? #TrumpZombie
Yes.
Nope.
@WaPoSean so Sen. Flake r u still voting for ur nominee?
@WaPoSean But, he still supports the nominee!
The 2 of u are absurd. Khan was up there because of Clinton not his son. Shame on all of you!
@washingtonpost I hope to hear from both of you, my Senators, you will NOT vote for him
You and McCain lost my vote in Arizona.  You both took Trump's comment out of context.  U both should be replaced.
Well Said. But McCain unlike you is putting #Partyb4Country and still endorsing @realDonaldTrump. Moral Compass?
@washingtonpost
@SenJohnMcCain supports #Trump & the #GestapoOfParanoia  #GrosslyObscenePlatform. GOP births  #TrumpParanoidParty
... Breaking. VFW slams Trump for attacking Gold Star families.
@WaPoSean #Trumptreason
@WaPoSean Khizr Khan was tricked into smearing Donald Trump http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/presidential-campaign/289932-khizer-khan-was-tricked-into-smearing-donald-trump …
@WaPoSean Its demonstrably false that @realDonaldTrump does not represent the @GOP He is the nominee!!!
@washingtonpost excellent view senator mccain and true.
Finally, leadership. I'm sorry to see @SenateMajLdr and @SpeakerRyan remain MIA.
wikileaks should look into your dealings in Africa - both you and McCain have been diasters for AZ
@washingtonpost yeah well, you're both still supporting the orange psycho tho...
But, he still thinks Trump would be the best next president? What line would he need to cross to lose endorsement?
Not strong enough, too concerned with his reelection than the country! Party Wimp!
@WaPoSean Now will you and McCain condemn Trump as nominee?
Oh please, everyone knows that you can't stand @SenJohnMcCain and want him to retire. It is the worst kept secret in the Senate.
The next AZ Senator to be fired >> @JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain @WaPoSean 
Nothing to do with Trump either.
two pussies
So what is McCain even crawing about? Something that never happened?
https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/setting-the-record-straight …
Well said about what? He references Trump's attacks on the family, but Trump never attacked the family.
Proud of my Senators.
Do you live under a rock?  Do you read and or watch the news???
Well said but too late. You leave a fallen soldiers parents alone. Rep or Demo. Trump is still attacking them
