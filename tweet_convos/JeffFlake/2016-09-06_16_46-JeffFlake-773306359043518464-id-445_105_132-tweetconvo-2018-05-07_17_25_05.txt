LOL, going against what the people voted for is not gonna help win re-election
No you're not. You're working to be sure Americans never get out from the yoke of Democrat domination
Cradle to grave right Jeff.
You both have done squat My health care cost is equal to house payment #ReplaceTheFlake Vote @kelliwardaz
You ARE a flake and a liar
#PrimaryFlake
How about we repeal Obamacare care? Arizonans are hurting. 2018 doesn't look great for you, just saying
Oh really? Obamacare on its last leg and you should have repealed it!! Goodbye...2018 just around the corner.
Traitors!
Jeff Flake never again never McCain is fraud legacy...represents himself does not represent his constituents
For the 1st time ever l’ll be voting for a candidate I oppose, Anne Kirkpatrick. McCain must go and you next Flake
Vote for kDr. Kelli Ward in the primary against Flake. She is 20 points ahead in recent polls.
Okay, AZ now time to start a recall petition for McCain.
He lied to AZ voters, repeatedly !
Enjoy retirement. You're down over 20 points #primary
McCain probably won't shut up in any event.
That didn't age very well did it? This is why Republicans can't have anything nice... they don't follow through on their promises...

McCain signed on w/BHO to cut veteran pay. Deplorable. Not true Republican. Shameful
Shameful yes, but I don't think he qualifies as a deplorable.
Senator Flake, l voted for you to become senator. Its time to support Mr.Trump. I am dissapointed in you. I want that wall.
A message from us constituents in Arizona @SenJohnMcCain & @JeffFlake
That's great!
KMLWAAGBATM
Lying, two-faced pieces of rubbish. You are failures. Cannot wait till the both of you lose your seats. The most loathed men in US
The funny thing is Jeff your done and don't even know it yet.Did you get more than 63,000,000votes? Our POTUS DID!
You're a pair of disgusting liars!
Wasn't it Mccain that ensured Obamacare would continue.
Bye bye
You had a chance, but blew it.  McCain got off on screwing the American people.  No respect for either of you.
Well then u should have been fighting harder to change it u loser
Glad you're not my representatives. You should be preventing not fixing problems that happened on your watch.
Your true party, the Democrat Party, is calling.
They should have choices, now they have none thanks to you and MCCAIN!! Give me a break and stop lying! Elect a new Senator Arizona!!
Hypocrit!
Flake as worthless as his words and assurances
Vote for HlthCare popular w/Dems & DC-unpopular w/constituents, you voted for D.C.
Absolute falsehood.
That is like closing the barn door after the horse runs out, MORONS, U had Ur chance 2help Arizona&McCain gave thumbs down= middle finger up
All words and no action. Typical. #DrainTheSwamp
You are the most money/power driven politician in the GOP today!
THAT bus has already left, the penalties are stunningly high & people will pay penalties before they will participate in the fraud of ACA
Don't worry Patriots, all traitors will be out of office soon. Actually not soon enough for me. Yesterday would have been nice.
Democrat much?
You nothing but a liar!
Perhaps @JeffFlake your friend @SenJohnMcCain should have repealed it, instead of pleasing Schumer & Gang on the left would have helped!
Hey Flake, does it hurt when your nose grows like this???
Oh Flake off. You & McCain do not care about anything, but bashing Trump! McCain coming g back worse news ever,I was hoping he would retire!
You've already shown us who you really are.  Don't let the door hit you on your way out in 2018.
No, you're trying to make sure Arizonans have no health insurance at all and pay out of pocket. That's a good way to kill people off!!!
Traitor. You and both John McCain. You now care about Arizonians but forget about all the other Americans. McCain voted  no to Healthcare.
Cowards. U 2 need 2 go!
"@SenJohnMcCain & I are working to ensure Arizonans w/o a choice in healthcare don't throw us out on our narrow arses." -Jeff Flake
Pure Bull...... You are Done Go home.

You sir are part of the problem. Time to be voted out of office.
And yet the once respected John McCain was the deciding vote in lite Obamacare repeal. You both are pathetic excuses for ur AZ constituents.
I'm feel'n better knowing you 2 stalwarts of the people are on the job!
You and McCain are finished. Enjoy your last year in office. Ppl are fed up with the lying and conniving. #drain the swamp
You're done, pal.
Finished. Nobody is buying your bullshit brand anymore.

You and Songbird can GTH.

@GOP you better get ur house in order.
You're a bold faced liar and your days are numbered. Rino traitor. We see thru your B.s.
No you aren't
Even his name indicates what a flake he is:flaking
1. To bail out of something at the last minute 
2. To break a contract
3. To lie
What about ALL Arizonans not receiving a penalty... You are such a trainwreck
Drain the #RINO  swamp. Flush the #RINO  sewer. Repeal & Replace #RINO  Congress.
I only voted for u and McCain because of Trump! Not any more!
VOTE FLAKE OUT!!!!!
The nice thing is by 2019 you'll be out of office.
Just a reminder #SnowFLAKE
Hey @JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain
Bullshit @SenJohnMcCain killed the start of fixing Obamacare.  U both need to be replaced
Nice try at a comeback. #way2late
You have worked yourself right out of a job. It's a sham that you pulled on ur constituents.
Well #McCain certainly destroyed his #Arizona constituents in end didn't he?! #Dope

Progressives like Flakey love Obamacare. Don't be fooled by the lies.
Bull.  Shit

Lying Politician

I don't even live in Arizona, I have to deal with Chuckie in NY, but you, jeff, are a piece of work. Liar liar pants on fire. Buh-bye
Thank God Flakes, you'll be out of office in 2018. It can't get here soon enough.
Sorry flake, you got off the Trump train and your now standing all alone at an empty station with your Liberal friends. Bye bye
25 points down! How does it feel senator, being first to be drained into the sewer of irrelevance!!
#Obamacare is a denial of Liberty #dueprocess  #RiseupAmerica
I'm old enough to remember John McCain sticking it to all Americans by not voting to repeal. Didn't hear you complain about that.
So then why didn't you support the President in Repeal & Replace? Now that Obamacare is crippling Arizona you finally want to do something?
Hope you get primaries
Time foryou two to hit the road bro. AZ gives us you, McCain, Brewer, and Joe.  What's in the water, pendulums?
@SenJohnMcCain CAUSED the continued non-competitive theft from these insurers! Time to find out how much $$ you guys made off lobbyists!
>The old '  bolted horse, stable door' policy 
That's Obama CARE u wanted bc yr dems buddies own it. People of AZ b damned as long as u get yr compensation.  You 2 r nt doing it for free
oh so that's what you're doing.
LIARS!  #VoteThemOut

@kelliwardaz
@kelliwardaz's spanking you in the polls for good reason, @JeffFlake.
You 2 #Senators R untrustworthy & not worthy of the #American voters! When U get your heads on straight come & talk to us! @realDonaldTrump
Then why didn't you repeal the monstrosity when you had the chance?
Your term will be up in what 1 year? Net time try running as a Democrat perhaps those retards will elect you. GOP never again.
by stopping the processing when McCain voted against the last bill?
Resign before you get demolished in 2018. Is anyone buying your book?
Too little too late
He is a flake alright.
Um this is a lie, @SenJohnMcCain had a chance to change healthcare and he didn't. Two liars continue to lie.
Jeff Flake sees how the wind is blowing with @kelliwardaz kicking his ass.  He is in self preservation mode.
This aged terribly. Terrible men
Say what?
Liar
Ya...
Really ? How? You nor McCain want to help anyone but the Democrat party. TRAITORS to voters in OVER 2800 counties. We won-remember asshole?
Then what happened? All words & 0 action! Was this 'pure' politics? Yes, yes it was....#AZ
you're a PHONY, is that why McCain voted against repeal? #KelliWard2018!
U and ur colleague are incompetent & r only interested in going against everything our POTUS stands for. DR. Kelli Ward for US Senate.
Where's congressman Joe Wilson when you need him???
Twitter moments are a bitch aren't they. Like a public record with a date stamp.
Liar!
Um, not really.
#WhatHappened?
You and your buddy are about as low as they come. Say... "bye bye career"

Should have deleted this one guys. You both turned out to less than, honest or trustworthy. #sad
You lied to your constituents & all America. Typical politician - cannot be trusted. AZ will take care of ousting u from that cushy job.
U need us the middle class Mr flake
Didn't even no that was your real last name lol . And working with an 80 yr. And been in Congress 30 plus . Not good for the working class
you jerks have got to stop puttjng your petty bs ahead of our needs. People are HURTING!!! Stop fighting repeal!
John McCain does know that he is the reason at this point that there are obama fines? All he had to do was vote to repeal it and he failed
Funny, cause I know A LOT of Arizonans who are working hard to make sure that neither one of you gets re-elected! 

That's very heroic of you, better idea to voted on repeal & replace, pathetic tweet
We don't want anything from you or John McCain!  You two Rhinos against the will of the AMERICAN people and #MAGA!
Bye Bye
Liar!
YES!!!
You lying POSs. I hope @realDonaldTrump puts all of y'all on same healthcare with all of us. Not fair that we pay for yalls perfect care!

Flake your an embarrassment and a liar
Speaking of waste
