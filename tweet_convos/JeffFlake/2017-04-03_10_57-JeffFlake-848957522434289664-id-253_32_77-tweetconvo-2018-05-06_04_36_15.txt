Shame!
DO NOT VOTE TO CONFIRM GORSUCH. Your constituents
BE CLEAR.  The nuclear option is YOUR failure.  It is bc YOU've become so partisan and uncompromising.
I guess qualifications don't matter just plagiarism. Gorsuch cant even use his own words. Don't forget #MerrickGarland
@JeffFlake HOW CAN YOU CONTINUE BEING SO AWFUL
@JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain protect checks/balances, democracy & Senate integrity #NoNuclearOption #NoGorsuch @twwnaz @Arizona_Strong
As a constituent I urge you to vote against changing the rules
you cannot hide your hypocrisy. None of the GOP supporting this can. Listen to your constituents. #NoGorsuch #NoNuclearOption
#flakeout2018. Tick tock
We need a Justice who is going to help overturn Citizen's United. #CorporationsAreNotPeople
Remember ALL majorities end. Do not kill filibuster. Do not ruin Senate through your / party's hubris.
You created this when you refused to even consider #MerrickGarland #shameonyou
Please consider not supporting change of filibuster rules. From MGM 85377
Don't go nuclear. Gorsuch won't get 60 because he's too extreme. You follow 45, not what's in best interest of those you "represent"
#NoFlake2018
You have no right to preach about no filibuster after refusing to give Garland a vote. #NOVOTE for Gorsuch from treasonaous administration!
Boooo
You do not have my support. I respectfully disagree with your position on #JudgeGorsuch.
McMconnell stole SCOTUS seat. He vowed to obstruct President Obama from day one. It's on the record, in the history books. Read Constitution
Hypocritical double talk.  Remember when the Republicans refused to even consider Omama's pick for the court for over a year?  That is B.S.
p.s.  Looks like the Republicans invoke cloture and railroad in their nominee.  Flake...your fired.
#MakeAmericaSmartAgain  Say no to Republican corporate sellouts.  So #fired
PLEASE DO NOT vote to change the rules of the senate! All eyes are on your choices. Do the right thing! NO NUCLEAR!!
Of course you support Gorsuch!  You're in trump's pocket!
If a question of #tRump #treason goes b4 #Supremes & #Gorsuch votes for his appointer, #electeds who #enabled will be held accountable
#MerrickGarland was a #GOP pick and you prevented his hearing anyway.  Thoughts on why you did that? #NoGorsuch
Make you a deal @JeffFlake, explain what your lot pulled re: Garland to your elementary school kid/grandkid, then get back to me.
#MerrickGarland
Shameful minority 45 does not deserve this appt. Change your vote for love of country! Cross the aisle and support a fair SCOTUS
We don't want gorsuch!!!!!!!!!!! For go's sakes you work for us!!
So, a moment of coherency and now it's back to partisan loyalty to the detriment of #USA #women & #workers, eh? #flakeofff, Jeff!
Boy you only won by 3% in 2012. We are coming for that seat! Show me your opponent and I'll be like...
You should be speaking against the threat of nuclear option & supporting legitimate reasons others have against Gorsuch. You're out #2018
Coming from a guy who introduced legislation clearing the way for ISPs to sell my browsing history to the highest bidder,  I call BS on you.
I do think it's funny that after the Rep party was so disrespectful by refusing Obama an op to fill the seat they get upset over this.
#MerrickGarland
"Spent my time proving how mindlessly hypocritical I and my party are"
I hope you do not support the "nuclear" plan, don't start changing rules that are in place to protect the minority,
thank you Jeff Flake!
.I don't have a huge income, but I'm setting some aside to support your opponent in 2018. I'll be knocking on doors. #Resist #NotMySenator
Lynch was not a scotus nominee. So parallel holds no water.
GOP didn't allow Garland a vote if payback so be it.
things and times change Jeff.
GOP became party of thieves, liars, racists, etc
They STOLE presidency by treason
Now want us to be happy with their shitty nominee choice
We're getting rid of you in 2018 #shakeflake
I read section in Const on senate elections. Flake is about to be melted.
Ignored my vote for Obama. I voted for him to pick a Supreme Court judge and you denied that for him. So deny it for Trump.
I use my tweet to urge Senators to remember their plans for Merrick Garland. Also, to reconsider abdicating their integrity, honor, & duty.
Merrick Garland.
#MerrickGarland
I was more wordy but yes.
Dislike
Disgusting. GOP claims the president has right to have SCOTUS of their choice approved...the last President NOMINATED Garland. HYPOCRITES!!!
Merrick Garland.
Merrick Garland.
Of course you did. He probably helped get your racist kid out of trouble. What do you think of #MerrickGarland? When did you vote for him?
You are a huge disappointment to your constituents.
Hyp. O. Crit.
Don't let McConnell nuke the senate rules!! Great, you love Gorsuch -- but he doesn't have 60 votes! New nominee. #MerrickGarland
voting you out Jeff
#merrickgarland
Everyone call his office, 202-224-4521 and express your irritation at this senator who seems to have forgotten what was done to Garland.
Only the naive would think the dems won't fight a stolen appointment tooth and nail.
Remember a man named Merrick Garland?How was he treated by you and your party?
Merick Garland you incredible hypocrite! Shame on you all!
your days are numbered 
Count down 2018 . Placing my bets
best part of my day is watching the pro-Trump people light up your mentions. Looks like no one likes you.
@SenJohnMcCain I sincerely hope @TheDemocrats  do #filibusterGorsuch & screw the @GOP that are trying to steal #MerrickGarland's #SCOTUSseat
I hope this is your last hurrah!!
#Garland #NotJudy #ButYesJudge
#MerrickGarland
You and your colleagues stole that seat. You put Party before country. Unacceptable. UnAmerican. And now you will go nuclear.
you didn't give Merrick Garland a chance you hypocrite.
Do you bother checking constituent calls, emails, faxes, and letters? ARIZONA IS NOT WITH YOU! You work for us! Not Trump!
Gorsuch will be confirmed due to GOP majority, but pls don't act as if the Dems are the bad actors here since GOP didn't do right by Merrick
Merrick Garland should have had your support.  Gorsuch will forever be tainted.  2018 will vote you OUT. Fluff and nonsense.
You should listen to your constituents, we DON'T want Gorsuch confirmed! If you were man enough to hold a town hall you would know this!

GARLAND
It's about the institution, don't destroy it
Last year's rape of the "spirit" of advise & consent cannot be forgiven. Sorry.
Jeff - you are a good man but it's sad that the republicans started this mess by not allowing  Obamas people in -
#MerrickGarland #Senate #FilibusterGorsuch
Were you this generous when a previous nominee could not even get an appointment for an interview?
Every time we turn around, the Republicans are changing the rules to get what they want. What happened to honor and integrity?
They already moved to Canada
You aren't using twitter to communicate with colleagues. You're trying desperately to court public opinion. It won't work. #MerrickGarland
Merrick Garland.
@JeffFlake are you keeping count? You are not representing us! #TrumpFlake
Glad to hear you are supporting Judge Gorsuch. He is the right person for this Supreme Court seat. Republicans need to work with Pres. Trump
Are you one of those college educated white women that Tina Fey just tore into?
Senate rules require #60votes. #gop to break the rules for Trump?  I really don't think you are reading this right. #NoGorsuch
You have an obligation not to change the rules simply because you can't win the game. It is short sighted and bad for America. #Flakeout2018
Love all crying about Garland. Dems would have done the same thing. Just surprised Reps had the balls to.

That's the best you could do? 
Do you want a full 4 year accredited university degree taught over a Tweet? #TrumpUdontCount
Still weak...you need to stop trolling people if you don't have a come back.
I guess you do need a college degree to understand a comeback
would've been great is if you had showed Garland the curtesy of a hearing. Just remember Dems will regain power. You can't undo nuclear
Did you also speak out for Garland hearing?
Im hope your remarks are given as much weight as were theirs when we said u ignored ur constitutional responsibilty on Garland. 0.000000%
give Garland a hearing first then Dems will talk.
Indeeed, if nothing else, at the very least, he deserves a vote
You're a sell out to deep pocket interests, so this doesn't surprise.  So looking forward to 2018. I will work very hard to help unseat you.
So who's our nominee? Let's get some blue up in Arizona! Let's show the country who we really are #NotTrump!
The president is under investigation for treason. Let that sink in for a minute. 

He shouldn't get to make lifetime appointments.
Merrick Garland
Merrick Garland @potus under fed investigation. Need more?
@JeffFlake #MerrickGarland was the subject of a months long filibuster. Remember?  Hypocrite.
You CANNOT move forward w this while DJT is under scrutiny for Russian influence. Do not allow TrumPutin's agenda to advance!
The @SenateDems R filibustering because it is a stolen #SCOTUS seat @POTUS44 nominated a main stream moderate & U wouldn't give him a chance
#MerrickGarland
Hey, @JeffFlake - precedent is set, no SC nomination in last year of presidency. This is Trump's last year. Nom waits for new Pres.

I speak about you everyday. How nasty you are and how I cant wait to vote against you.
Elections have consequences. #MerrickGarland didn't even get a hearing.
#FlakeOut2018
What words could your #Senate colleagues have used to change your mind about allowing a vote on #Garland last year? Say those ones #FTW
#MerrickGarland
They found your price, eh?
He was cheap
@JeffFlake Your last decision— allowing ISPs to sell private citizens’ web histories— indicates your decisions are suspect. Gorsuch? Nahhhhh
We haven't forgotten that the 2016 Republican National Platform is chockful of vicious anti-gay bigotry.
Gorsuch is a right wing extremist. If he weren't, right wing groups wouldn't have spent tens of millions pushing him on the public.
Please don't nuke the rules to ram him through. If not for upholding Senate norms and minority rights, then for Republicans in 2021.
You insult our intelligence every time you speak.
Intelligence Agencies don't have time to spy and topple other nations presidents anymore; they're too busy investigating Trump's Swamp.
At least he got a hearing!  The last SCOTUS nominee didn't.
It's a stolen seat and all of you know it!  #MerrickGarland
Arizona needs to replace you with a senator who doesn't rubber stamp all Trump wants.

I will be using my 2018 ballot to vote for your opponent.  You are a Party First Senator and are not putting the people of AZ first!
Jake Flake will not be reelected in 2018.  He is a mindless Trumpster. Does not hold town halls & hides from his constituents. Sad!

#MerrickGarland
I'm going to use my vote to get rid of you. And urge my neighbors to join me. Can't wait.
#noFlake2018
What a hack you are. Why can't you do the right thing once in awhile? Shame!
Merrick Garland
90% of the GOP need to be replaced in future elections.
Was Garland treated fairly?
Democrats are a bunch of sissys. !
It takes real balls to stand up for real American values, for women, for immigrants, for the planet... it's actually the conservative thing
#MerrickGarland
#MerrickGarland
Shameful. Gorsuch isn't a good candidate, even if #MerrickGarland had been given a vote. You should have spoken out against Mitch McConnell.
Don't change the rules. Don't use "The nuclear option"
"Change the behavior of senators"? How about changing your support of a POTUS who behaves in such indecent and immature ways?
#MerrickGarland
Merrick Garland
#merrickgarland Flake is a typical white old man. You realize this impacts OUR future?NOT yours! We will still be here in 40 yrs God willing
Merrick Garland.
Merrick Garland
Merrick Garland
Merrick Garland. A legitimate sitting President nominated him. Gorsuch is not a legitimate nominee.

Of course you'd agree with Obama administration! They didn't sell us out to other countries. They did no wrong in your eyes!
Merrick Garland!
Save it! Stolen seat, FBI investigation, Gorsuch answered no questions! U must be a tool & up for re-election. All Dems should stand up!
#StopGorsuch and confirm #MerrickGarland
Don't change senate rules on vote get a new nominee
YOU SUCK AT REPRESENTING ARIZONANS! Buh-bye!
Cannot wait for you to lose your seat...such a damn windbag hypocrite.
#MerrickGarland .
Call his office express yourself, takes 2 minutes. 202-224-4521
literally every Dem and Progressive can't wait to see Turtle force you all to nuke. Live by the sociopath; die by the sociopath.
Merrick Garland
Say it with me now: Mer - ick - Gar - land.
Are you kidding me? Listen to AZ constituents and vote #noGorsuch. President under investigation by FBI. No nominations until cleared.

Remember that Trump is under FBI investigation AND you refused to allow a vote on Garland! I live in Arizona and will vote in 2018. Karma
Where are all of your supporters? Can't see them
@senjudiciary don't be a braggart. Where did the dark money come from and did you get your share? I guess you can buy a judge.
#filibuster   #filibuster  #filibuster!!
#MerrickGarland   wasn't even given a hearing, you freaking political house-torching arsonists!
sort of like Garland? #fraud #nointegrity
As a constituent of yours, i hope you know what a betrayal of my trust this is. Lifetime appointment of a treasonous administration is sick.
@SenJohnMcCain has the distinction of actually doing something for Americans & Arizonans. I can't think of a single good thing you have done
@JeffFlake is also proud of his A+ from the @NRA
Thoughts on Merrick garland's treatment? No, too craven? Same ol' GOP
Democrats lost Garland lost
You've failed your oath to God to protect our Constitution. You never advised or consented  Garland. Trump is under investigation, ...
I heard part of it! It was good. And yes, you did consent to Lynch. I think maybe those days should be over though.... #shediddamage
Senator, what was your stance on Merrick Garland's nomination being sat on for a year?
Shame on you #2018 is almost here
Senators @SenJohnMcCain @SenTedCruz & @SenatorBurr all vowed to permanent block any Clinton nominee.
#hypocriteparty
It's to bad you support Gorsuch. I will not support you for reelection.
LISTEN FLAKEY!!!
Gorsuch wont be able to stop you from being voted out soon, you self-serving, hypocritical worm
I cannot  wait  to elect any opponent of yours in 2018.
Aren't you special...try using your remarks to save our environment and take over attempt by a Russian sympathizer regime.
Country before party @JeffFlake. Please don't blindly follow party lines. Do the RIGHT thing.
Listen to your constituents! If you still think you're on the winning Trump train you deserve to get dumped
Thanks for doing the right thing. I agree with you on this issue.
Your constituents are asking you to vote no on #Gorsuch. This president is under investigation. He doesn't get to nominate anyone. #2018
Amen! @JeffFlake do you think we will forget how you have been Trump's lap dog instead of our other Maverick?
Two words - Merrick Garland. Yes, a nominee by a president should get a floor vote. Republics denied him. Scalia died in February 2016!
Why didn't you urge your #Senate colleagues to reconsider Pres Obama's nominee?
Your a hypocrite and I'm going to work very hard for you to lose your seat in 2018.
Just 1 question @JeffFlake, why did you prevent hearings on Garland? Didn't he deserve the same courtesy? GOP hypocrisy is deplorable.
