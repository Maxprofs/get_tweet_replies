Strong support for @JeffFlake at the #PioneerDayParade in Snowflake today! #AZsen #TeamFlake 
Next tell them about how kicking 22mil ppl off of medicaid will cause a lot of them to die.
NO ONE will lose healthcare with repeal...ALL will have better healthcare at lower cost! Pull your head out!
Please explain how gutting medicaid, cutting subsidies, and a 1500% increase in deductibles accomplishes any of that.
My monthly premium tripled, & deductible went from $0 to $4K per person with O-care. You are spewing MSM & DEM lies. I am living in reality!
CBO is non-partisan, and doesn't "lie"
Ha! The same CBO that said 19M would sign up for O-care by now & only ~9M have? CBO that said premiums would drop & they sky-rocketed? 
The very same. But the score you refer to didn't account for active sabotage from GOP like withholding subsidies and creating instability.
Stop drinking the Kool-aid...the only political sabotage and obstruction is from LEFT. Then they lie & project on the RIGHT. Alinsky tactic!
Please run for president
And how many of its residents will you killl off by voting for @realDonaldTrump and @GOP murderous healthcare?
including your son that killed 23 dogs?  #gilbert23 you're schtick doesn't work on all arizonans, i'm a life long az, i know who you are
Maybe we should look through ur data feed to see where u called the aca death panels?
Fix the ACA #NeverRepeal
Hope they can keep their hospital and health insurance? You don't have to reply as if you would anyway. Ain't America great again?
Yes! They can keep their hospital & health insurance! This is repealing the failed ACA that took that away!
Ignorance is bliss.
You should know...you have it in spades!

#NeverFlake @JeffFlake we are going to run a campaign head and shoulders above any #rinos to #MAGA 
Your kids are lucky, they still get parades. The ANTIFA is killing childhood across this nation.
I know it well. My grandma is one of William Jordan Flake's 20 plus children! Aften Flake.
NO. on TrumpCare/FlakeCare!
Please please, I beg you to not vote in favor of the healthcare bill tomorrow. Please work with all senate including Dems to improve ACA
Jeff Flake...STAY STRONG... dont let Fake Trump bully you.... you have a lot of support.  The Republican Party needs to change! Pres. 1st!
He could not walk down any street and not get his arse beat to a pulp.
Tell your kids also the bad decision you made when you disregard the people that put you in the senate; especial interest goes first right?
@TeamFlake  Your children should be ashamed of you. You want to kill their friends and millions of others in Arizona with a "YES"
Repeal Obama care. I don't want the Government and bureaucRats telling me what kind of insurance is best for me or 2018 your GONE!
@TeamFlake shut up
You don't know what's in the bill but will proceed ?U sold out to the Devil Puppet.U don't give a damn about Us!You're exempt from plan
Somehow "Snowflake" seems appropriate.
I don't know folks did you see him on @CNN today hocking his book he seems embarrassed by those who vote for him he appears to be above all
Explains some about a lack of empathy, knowledge or identification with minorities or others shown by your kids at a time.
expose to world
If you vote to repeal the ACA you'll be condemning many in Snowflake to suffer & die. And they'll know it was you who did it.
I tell my kids the same thing !!!
Go @kelliwardaz! Rid us of this #RINO!
Go #KelliWard! http://hiddenamericans.com/politics/anti-trump-flake-trouble-primary-challenger-surges/ … America needs you. Rid us of these #democraticparasites!
No support outside the in-breds in the town that bears your name, and is all your relatives...you are going DOWN...RINO liar!!!
Please follow your heart on this, not the presidents.
Really cute.
Sorry, Sen, very concerned about your ACA vote this week. Keep hearing "Pres needs a victory." What about us?! 1/
YES.. we NEED a win...repeal ACA!!!

Not so fast Flake. Fix the ACA, protect Russia investigation, enough gerrymandering in Phoenix. Make nice with our neighbor Mexico.
As you vote and make policy please keep in mind that morethan 30%of Navajo county residents live below the poverty line. Make helpful policy
Koch bros don't have your center of the universe people in mind. Don't do their bidding.

Thank you for treating Deedra with kindness. That's a rare thing these days. Could you teach your co-workers and your boss please?
Do you mean the one that got away with 28 dog deaths?
After you loose the next election u can spens a lot more time there.  Maybe the school nnedd a grounds keeper.
Child abuse!
Do they believe in bipartisanship in your universe? So tired of blue vs red and us vs them. Show some true leadership and do what's right
There is no bipartisanship...Dems ard obstructionists. There is right (repeal ACA), and wrong ACA.
He represents illegals and progressives against the interests of most Americans...sad!
follow back
Bye Bye #JeffFlake is no for #AmericaFirst
RIght now it's the center of controversy looks like you are on your way out Traitor #JeffFlake #AmericaFirst
Does @JeffFlake stand w/ Deedra Abboud when she defended her husband’s "RIGHT under ISLAM 2 have as many as 4 wives"
http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/the-chosen-one-6433272 …
So no to TrumpCare and fix ACA!  How hard is that??!!!
Please lobby for a bipartisan effort to fix ACA. To vote for a bettercare plan, which is neither better nor care, or repeal spells disaster
Just vote NO on healthcare repeal
HA...that is STUPID!
You should try getting some support in cities and towns that were not founded by your ancestors.

The GOP has now solidified its place in history as a political party that became a "movement"- which and then transformed into a hate group.
please vote NO on Trumpcare
I bet your kids are grateful for the health insurance they have. Mine are, please don't take away my health care.
Yes...plsease REPEAL ACA so we  and our children can have healthcare!
Healthcare. Can you explain how the proposed bill helps people and what problem does it solve. Oh and how are you voting?
Lowers cost...improves quality. He will probably vote against it because he is treasonous McCain's "mini-me"!
I have fond memories of Pioneer days in Snowflake. Sitting on the curb catching candy and watching the rodeo. Makes me nostalgic.
Not how most people live. Most people live in cities without neighborhood support. They need healthcare
Everyone in US has healthcare...ACA is destroying it...MUST be repealed!
You need to expand your horizons. There are lots of Arizonans who could use your help. Especially on #Healthcare.
YES...please save our healthcare by reoealung ACA!
Don't take away their healthcare. #VoteNo #SaveOurCare #FixACA
Don't take away their healthcare. #VoteYes #SaveOurCare #RepealACA

Did you tell the seniors, vets and families how you are trying to take away their health care with the TERRIBLE #TrumpCare? #VoteNO
Snowflake has lots of voters volunteering to repeal unAmerican pvt school vouchers that degrade the choice of most AZ families. @arizona_sos
Nothing more American than School vouchers...Government run lying, brain-washing institutes, with no freedom of choice are un-American!
You should totally run for Mayor of Snowflake!
Yes...PLEASE get out of Senate because you are you are badly hurting AZ & US! Maybe you can make your family happy in SnowFLAKE...resign!
Yup another photo op! Use that space between your ears to vote NO on the motion to proceed on the TAX cut/health bill!
Yup another photo op! Use that space between your ears to vote YES on the motion to proceed on the TAX cut/health bill!
Someone changed my tweet! It should say vote NO!
. Vote NO loud and clear Rebuild and restore ACA
Nah, it really isn't when you think about how many people in Maricopa county you represent.  A few people don't represent the many.
Does everyone have healthcare in the center of the universe? If so, I want to go. Sounds amazing.
Everyone in US has healthcare regardless of ACA. ACA is destroying US healthcare and MUST be repealed to save it!
We in Arizona are concerned about our Healthcare.  
Please do not repeal the ACA.
We in Arizona are concerned about our Healthcare.  
Please REPEAL the ACA!
Un-fortunately, he is with Democrats AGAINST country!
Get off the Trump Train and I might just vote for you. Be your own man, Jeff. You know what's the right thing to do & it's not with the WH.
It is not the center of Arizona's voting universe. Guess you're hoping they will save you. Have you told them rural areas will lose care?
No one will lose healthcare...ALL will have better healthcare at lower cost with ACA repeal...TRUTH!
That's what I tell my kids about Hayden, Arizona.
Those of us in Pinetop Lakeside know that THIS is the heart of Arizona
HA...it is Show Low! 
We used to call it the arm pit.  Go might Roadrunner
Make sure you keep pandering to hospital groups and insurance company's so you can really stick it to the middle class.
Nice country.
Please remember the difference between the number of registered voters in Snowflake vs. Phoenix or Tuscon.
YES...Obamacare hurts ALL...regardless of where they live!
How many college grads reside there; how about post-grad grads?
Who cares?

Tired of Whitehouse being controlled by the Mafia Russian Govt. @GOP letting our county burn  You are complicit if you do wait & nothing
I can't believe this is a real town.
Support bipartisan solution for ACA @SenateMajLdr = traitor & sociopath  Scorched earth  policies hurt Arizona.  You r hiding from truth.
YOU are hiding from truth...ACA is imploding of it's own weight.

I bet that at least one person there depends on Obama care
NO ONE depends on Obamacare...it has collapsed under it's own weight and is destroying healthcare for ALL!!!
Please vote against the MTP

How many of those people rely on ACA or Medicaid or Social Security or DiSability Insurance?Do you care? #killthebill then #ImpeachTrump SOS
No one rely on ACA...it has FAILED! It has put US healthcare on precipice of complete destruction...MUST be repealed to save US healthcare!
Here's hoping you stay smart. BTW, no to Trumpcare.
