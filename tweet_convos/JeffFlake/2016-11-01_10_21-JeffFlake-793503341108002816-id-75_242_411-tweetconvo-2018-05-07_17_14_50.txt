.@JeffFlake I'm now ready to activate the secret plan.

you turned on Trump. we will never forget or forgive you.
turned on? Is Trump gay?
I hear you, man. Seems like every day. Every FREAKIN' DAY recently!

Also, not to be a spelling Nazi, but you left out the "r".
Just watching in disbelief here in Nairobi
.@JeffFlake HOT FLAKE!
If Lincoln had had a cell phone, he could not have butt-tweeted with more eloquence.
you accept?  The #potus nomination for our party?  My hero!
You don't know #BetrayerFlake !!! Him & #BetrayerMcCain stabbd us in the back! @kelliwardaz is bttr any dy of wk
if you need bawlz- Mr.Flake might loan you his. #NeverTrump
Lay off the sauce...
.@JeffFlake @Goodtweet_man You took the words right out of my mouth, Senator.
@NickAPappas really needed to hear that tonight. Thanks.
I believe CVS has a salve for that.  
Drinking this early on a Tuesday?
He doesn't drink.  Maybe he just hit "Tweet" too soon.
I guess humor is not something you posses or understand?
Only when it makes sense.  Anyone who knows anything about Senator Flake knows that he is a staunch Latter-Day Saint.
Lee Cox sure is a bucket full of fun isn't he??!
and thin skinned as well

Duh.
You betrayed your party and your constituents. Shame on you.
Everything OK?
love you Mr. Flake. Thank you for being a strong supporter of what is RIGHT.
.@JeffFlake @ZaidJilani your colleague @KellyAyotte's "$ tweet" from a few years back was better
@SenJohnMcCain @SopanDeb @JohnJHarwood @jaketapper Trump will do away with NPR and PBS if he's President.
that is an interesting statement.  I couldn't agree more
@kjzzphoenix 
That's a bit...Flakey?
I commend you for leaving this pocket-Tweet up.
Is KJZZ a Phoenix radio/TV station? If so, what's wgH and what'd they do? If not, WTH?
Couldn't have said it better myself.
good to see you love @kjzzphoenix even if by accident
Um, Senator, I believe your butt is tweeting again.
Radio Arizona Pbs. A secret call out to Tupac.
@JoseArielCuevas yes, I agree
@aterkel KJZZ is NPR station in Phoenix. So maybe it was huhh? WTH to a story on him?
perhaps you're more orator than author, eh?
Hey @kjzzphoenix, I think maybe the Senator's pocket is trying to tweet a song request to yall.

Super secret code?
A encoded message to Russia ....

Source?
He may be being held hostage?
I disagree but respect the care with which you make your argument.
That's how we all feel, senator.
@JeffFlake
still makes more sense than anything Trump, who cannot read by the way, has ever said.
don't sign your tweets
They're good characters Jiff
Same

Umm, ok Senator!  I listen to @kjzzphoenix too!  Was it something they said?  Maybe about Chicago? Or Newport News, VA?
same tbh

Don't @ me, Jeff.
when a kid or grandkid grabs your phone without you knowing
Whoa, RINO much?
Wisest thing said by any Republican this election season #Flake2024
