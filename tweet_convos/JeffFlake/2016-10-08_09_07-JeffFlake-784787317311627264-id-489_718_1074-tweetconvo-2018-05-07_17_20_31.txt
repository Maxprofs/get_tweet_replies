You need to withdraw from "public service" because you truly are a flake.

Get real.  You are supporting Hiliary Clinton so why don't you leave the GOP ?
Mr Flake --You have your opinions--and we will remember those opinions when you run again.
Hillary can't get people to show at her rallies, doesn't matter where she goes, and Trump is wrong? Dream big!

Without Trump, Supreme Court is lost, trade deals are awful, Obamacare stays and terrorists flood in. BE SMART!!
.@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump Hey everybody, here's a RINO Globalist traitor. Remember the name.
Jeff Flake is quite the father -- one son a homophobic, racist, the other killed 17 dogs.
Jeff Flake & his ilk are the problem. Get behind the nominee or YOU step down.
@staggs8309 Megalomaniacs don't quit. In their mind they're never wrong.
The PEOPLE voted for Trump; you cannot reverse that!
Flake - how appropriate.  You choose Hillary over your constituents. I'm sure your voters are behind you - not.
Flake you are wrong on 90% of what you say about Trump, I will never for you. You are arrogant.
Too late to replace Trump. Help Republicans unite to defeat Hillary. We need your vote. Please reconsider.
Sen. Flake prefers Hillary? As opposed to?
If he wins, especially after all the crap you have done, I hope he rubs it in your face. You hypocrite.
I will be participating in a campaign to unseat you in 2016.
:Flake is so far up McCain you know what  he can't see daylight.
You are so wrong Jeff Fake.
@costareports To allow Hillary into office is far more divisive and damaging then Trumps Naughty words any day!
Hypocrites! WE will NOT vote for Flake & McCain unless they support the nominee! #AZWomenForTrump ShameOnFlake
And then what?? Like McCain, you have no solutions to any problems.
@costareports Americas silent majority is with @realDonaldTrump good luck when your names comes up on the ticket
Very disappointed Jeff.We have 2 real choices in this election. Neither is perfect just like you.Didn't take you long to Rhino up
Moral outrage from a man whose wife and son oversaw the abuse and deaths of 20+ dogs. Your family belongs in jail! #hypocrite
@washingtonpost

Nice try.  No cigar.
So let me get this straight. YOU represent US. WE chose @realDonaldTrump as our candidate. You decide to go against OUR WISHES?
@kmledf2 @realDonaldTrump @costareports Too funny.  As if your saying it makes it true.  Numbers shoot it down.
Thanks, Jeff, for speaking up for what is right. I'm shocked self-professed Christian men can stand with Trump.
Thank you for your integrity in standing up to @realDonaldTrump Endorse  Presidential candidate @Evan_Mcmullin #McmullinFinn
@washingtonpost too late now, got to let the American people decide.
Your name flake fits you perfectly! Why should Trump bow out? Hillary's evil is exposed!
@washingtonpost Jeff Flake:  Trump dominated tonight's  debate.
if you don't support Trump, our voters will only vote Trump.  Get on  board or get out of our way. We are going to Washington.
Oh brother. Jeff, I think he is in this to the end.  Now what?
@washingtonpost shame on you for not supporting the Republican nominee
Good luck holding your seat when President Trump supports your primary challenger.
@washingtonpost As a female from AZ I'm voting Trump!
Senator, you're one of the few Republicans left that I can still respect because you NEVER sold yourself out!
@washingtonpost why?  What have they promised you for "withdrawing" your support.  Stick it where the sun....,
Literally NOBODY cares about your opinion anyway.
goodNESS, shut up already. You obviously aren't a patriot and don't care about our nation's safety or Supreme Court appointments
Flake you're not worth a damn! Never Trumper is who you are,  Don't understand word 'forgiveness'!
@washingtonpost he is that much of an idiot that he is the only that doesn't see it! And his big ego!
I hope you're rested up, Senator. You are one of the few principled folks in the GOP who'll have to rebuild it.
@ElMonte08 @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost Thank you, Senator, for standing up even when it wasn't popular.
There is an honorable, conservative alternative to Trump for POTUS in 2016 -- @Evan_McMullin
I think we have identified your problem. You believe the Washington Post.
@washingtonpost why did it take so long for Republicans to have this epiphany?
No Jeff Flake you need to step down. We are voting you out this election you traitor to us Republicans.
You need to resign-wonder what you have said in your lifetime that was as bad or worse..you're all hypocrites!
You certainly instilled your values in your sons.
We will never stop supporting Trump, he will be the next president.
@washingtonpost & apparently better than you!! U sir are in wikileaks!!!

With all respect No Jeff you and the rest of the feckless,cowards that we sent to D.C. Are wrong about support for Trump
@washingtonpost good for you Jeff.
Don't need another good ol' boy in the oval office. Need a leader who will listen to and act on behalf of the American people.
Sen. Flake, You are welcome to join Democrats at any time. You are a gentleman & a patriot. You can be president after HRC.
No he should not , you should because you have not kept your promises to voters & violated the Constitution
@costareports And you would have also impeached Clinton in 95 I suppose?
@costareports you never supported him! Just keep your mouth shut!  https://www.youtube.com/embed/T1iRUvhvmmU …
Land deals, son/dogs.  Look at real issues Clinton/Benghazi/emails/support BC sexual assault & more
@neeratanden @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost A man who refuses to release TAXES will never withdraw.....he loves the attention!
@washingtonpost Your lying about running and your lack of support of DJT equals my resignation from the GOP & U
@washingtonpost coming from a man who raised a dog killing, animal abusive child. #throwingstonesinglasshouses
@washingtonpost
ALL GOP ESTABLISHMENT THAT HAVE NOT STOOD ON THE GOP PLATFORM NEED TO STEP DOWN - THAT'S WHY WE ARE HERE
@washingtonpost Shut up Flake, you're next. #RetireFlake to #MAGA!!!! #AZSen
Americans R fed up with all the flakes who have enabled Obama & btrayed voters who elected them. No saints here.
Would you sell out America for a chance to sound more conservative? Either we stand together or we all fall!
You're going to be primaried in 2018. Time for you to get off of the welfare train. Get a job!
@washingtonpost Jeff is a FLAKE
@washingtonpost And where were you @JeffFlake when Bill Clinton raped his first victim? My guess: you were cheering him on.
Mr flake you n McCain are disgusting
the VA in Phoenix is falling apart, where is useless McCain in this?
@blac @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost Flake is A Flake.  You will lose Senate unless u get behind Trump.  Down vote will be lost
and trump will lose too. Thank god
Add you to the list of things wrong with Hillary. Do you ever think ahead? Learn:
@tkdmike @realDonaldTrump Where have you been while Drumpf was making a mockery of this election? NOT representing AZ 
@blackrepublican @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost His ego won't allow it. Incapable of admitting an error, much less defeat.

@tkdmike @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost

Ten years too late, the GOP wish to call off the elections.
