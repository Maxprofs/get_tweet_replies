Now let's watch US children fall even further behind in world rankings.
Really? This is the endorsement u want? From anti lgbtq group? Just lost xover votes
not. A giant step backwards. McCain had $50K reasons to support her. We will dump Flake18
Shes an ignorant, incompentent billionaire donor who bought that nomination for 4.8 mil.
are you kidding.  I'm from MI,  she despises public school & has no clue of the struggle
@BetsyDeVosDeVos has no amount of intelligence/knowledge of ed system/ or caring for nation's kids.
"all" means rich and of the right color
Progress for white, privileged children. You're the greatest charlatans ever. #lostmyvote
BARF
The Worst Mistake You Will Ever Make. You just destroyed the Educational System.
Yes Jeff Flake, a lot of voters will remember this Nov 2018.  It won't be good for you.
yes, thanks for your partisan vote far an amazingly unqualified person. Downhill we go.
No wonder education in AZ is a joke. Seems you like to keep people ignorant so they vote for you.
I really wish this wasn't true but it's getting harder to believe it isn't... @cathiherrod @SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake
90% of children go to public schools. Welfare for  wealthy is not in the public interest.
will be advocating against you!  Listen to the people you represent!
Yes, thank you for ensuring lgbtq will continue being rejected in AZ. Shame on you!
I am very unhappy and disagree with BetsyDeVos.  I pray for AZ Children.
you are ridiculously bad people.
Hey @JeffFlake how about RTing the dozens & dozens of people who begged you not to vote for @BetsyDeVos @cathiherrod @SenJohnMcCain
Leap backward!
Morte
lol how funny thanks for fucking over all students 
#allnewaz18 #noflake18 . Evil people profiting off our children
Voted to put a woman in charge of education that has no experience. Shame on you.
You made it easier to segregate students. Accountability for all!
no not thank you. F u. I like that rhyme better.  Money talks & u r all fired
Yeah confirm someone who bought the job, with absolutely no experience. Great Job.
you are delusional. Check out schools in Oklahoma. No regs = no standards. #resist
cut me a break......  she is not qualified to run a preschool
says rich old white lawyer who pushed SB1062 that was too discriminatory for even Brewer.
still waiting for an answer
first person who supports your Devos vote I've seen. At least 2018 won't be a shutout

#ReplaceFlake2018 This nobody  tweet means nothing to me. Our entire country said NO!!!!!
YES we need strong leaders! Thank U 4standing for what's right and for AMERICA to be safe
Yeah, you  just sunk the hopes of the 99%, students and teachers supporting public school
When you retweet support from a hatemonger like @cathiherrod you're in trouble, Jeff. Sad! #DeVos #ShePersisted
no more @JeffFlake &know more @SenJohnMcCain @BetsyDeVos she better donate some of her money to the schools too. 
our senators are  bought and paid for - DeVos is a student debt vulture!
you are simply ignorant
This endorsement just lost u crossover votes. With mounting opposition on your right in AZ, probably was a bad idea
Thx 4 inspiring me to change voter reg 2 Republican so I can vote against Flake twice in 2018, primary and general.
a step into the great black abyss! DeVos is unqualified. Find some1 better!
frankly Jeff, RTing this clarifies u favor the religious right - which most Zonans aren't
I crossed party lines 2 vote 4 them bc they were most qualified, wish they did same for our kids
You're out of your goddamn minds.
let's see how proud you are of this vote in 2 yrs time
was it because she contributed$?
Are we talking about the same Betsy Devos who bought her way onto the Cabinet?  Confused.
BTW Cathi, you're delusional
a step forward? She isn't even aware of the fed gov's responsibilty to maintain adherence to I.D.E.A.
Seriously? A woman with NO education experience who paid $2m to #GOP candidates?
You voted for an unqualified woman simply because of campaign donations.  That's wrong.
may I ask your reason, I truly don't understand,  please explain, so many say it is bad
A step forward into the abyss.
. @JeffFlake I'm hurt. You retweeted @cathiherrod msg but not mine. #ImFromArizona #IVote #disappointed & I'm dismayed by your DeVoss vote
Thank you @SenJohnMcCain and @JeffFlake for voting to confirm @BetsyDeVos. A step forward for all children.
@SenJohnMcCain @BetsyDeVos this is why he retweeted hers
Haven't seen a retweet from all those disappointed in your vote, but we know. #swingleft
I'll be knocking on doors throughout AZ to ensure it's your last term!
I'll be knocking on doors with you.
I'm an AZ public school teacher and I strongly disagree with you.
whoever sent that is insane.
Thanks Jeff for showing your true colors and the lack of support for AZ
shame!
I'm not a fan for either man but truth is the truth.
I think you meant step backward.
Hopefully a step to get both of you defeated when your term is up!!
Count me in too.
