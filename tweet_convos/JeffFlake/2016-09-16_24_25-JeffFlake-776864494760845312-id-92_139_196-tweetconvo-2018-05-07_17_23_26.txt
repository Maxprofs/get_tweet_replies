@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs Jeff flake did not vote 4 Hillary but voted for Loretta Lynch, our AG who does not support freedom
As a rep. I have voted for you in your career. I will no longer do so. Your refusal to endorse Mr. Trump and now this. U r done
.@JeffFlake @HillaryClinton Just shut it. You've done enough damage as it is. Too late to rehabilitate yourself pal.
.@JeffFlake You are a man of courage. @Evan_McMullin stood to keep us safe from terrorists, and now I #StandUpWithEvan . Consider endorsing!
Don't put negative words out & u would not have to worry. Do u want Hilary 2 be president U certainly are helping
Saw the ad, Real nice job there rep flake... Glad to know you stand with constituents (that's sarcasm in case you missed it)
GOP since AuH20. I did not always like GOP  pick but always supported the party.  Support Trump, or I will never vote 4 u again
Sorry bucko, the very thing you accuse @realDonaldTrump of, you're guilty of yourself. You're a 
#McCainPuppet
Well Jeff, I'm sure she likes the clips she used a lot better as do all MOTHS. Your vote doesn't matter. Your words do. Well done
moron.u already gave what she want...
RINO of the biggest kind it wasn't about your vote it was about your support. Grow the hell up #Trump2016
Please read this http://www.nationalreview.com/article/440198/never-nevertrump-not-voting-trump-republican-suicide â€¦ and you will see why your stand is not good at this time. It's seriously truthful.
@SenJohnMcCain Since you both support HRC in absence of supporting your party nominee, I'll be voting for Democratic senators.
you're terrible to go against @realDonaldTrump. Hopefully you'll get voted out.
Well you made yourself very available in your strong non-support of the Republican candidate and now your stuck.
Americans can't wait to kick you out! Then you'll see what it's like to not have a job!
hey Jeff.... You are now and always the enemy.  You sold your soul to Hillary.  Not wise
Please come out and endorse Donald Trump, it is best for our country, we cannot put Hillary in there.
you are DONE, HISTORY! Your choice are HRC or DJT, period! Time for you to openly endorse @realDonaldTrump now!
Who are you voting for?
@JBaker31826004 @HillaryClinton 

Too bad. Too little. Too late.
@JBaker31826004 @HillaryClinton That's what happens when you run your mouth to get on air. Consequences.
@JBaker31826004 The question is who will you support?
@JBaker31826004 @HillaryClinton   Stop digging...
if you want to make a point, the refute the comments in the commercial.  Get behind or get out of the way.
well then why in the world will you not openly support @realDonaldTrump and help defeat #Hillary #RINO

Hey Flake, You better hope that Trump does not get elected because if he does your political career is over.
hey @JeffFlake , how is Pence a "good man", if he won't disavow KKKs?
hey @JeffFlake, you want KKKs, MRAs, and Nazis in the cabinet?  Really?  How about a clear repudiation, loser?
hey  @JeffFlake, if R nominee takes office, how long before we see lynchings and pogroms? Legalized mob violence? Is this what you want?
hey @JeffFlake, how about clear repudiation of R nominees, who is now egging randos on to assassination?
enjoy your time in office flake because its short lived trump will win az and your out in 2018
#Rino #Fake
Youwalk the line lose both sides. Next election remember. You Should Support Your Party
@debspargo89 @HillaryClinton Another screw-up by the Hillary Capaign.  That TWO people on that ad that are NOT for her.
looks like your remarks against Trump have come back to bite you. You knew that would happen. You had to know
True Americans are rallying behind @realDonaldTrump to save our country.Those that dont join will be remembered
too late. You have already proven you are not a Republican. Can't wait to boot you out of Congress!
if not @HillaryClinton R U voting 4 @realDonaldTrump? If not who?
What a stupid moron this man is #Arizona! We need to get this guy out! He's a hypocrite & fits in nicely w/Dems!
So you endorse Trump. Good for you - the dirty truth is out. @ReaganBattalion @HillaryClinton
You're so fake and phony, put the country first over your party, when I saw that video I was saying she promt,Rep
Hey Jeff. Go and hang out with Birther-boy some more. Sick!

Jeff the fake will vote for Hillary.....RECALL Jeff the Fake
you are no better than her anyway the wind blows to further yourself#Howdoyoulikehimnow
wow Jeff! Are you caving to #Trump? Please No!
you've made a huge mistake not endorsing Trump. You're going to be out on your ass in two years.
Nice commercial that you made against your own party, shows that your are not a true Republican,along with Mitt and a few others
what you guys are saying is that he can see that this man is a con man but he should ignore that like the rest of you
just like you are doing about all the lies that she @HillaryClinton  is giving us.. so yes to your question.
, what lies other than the email controversy and Benghazi he lives everyday it's no comparison
what about what she took out off the White House when Bill was pres? She don't care about you
what about the 4 bankruptcies filed left people closing their business y he made money he care a joke
I am one of your constituents, a female and I can't stand Hillary and didn't see you demand she take it down!!!
Flake  is a RINO
..Jeff yeah good luck getting reelected in Arizona you blew it..
I guess you are voting for?? Johnson ?? Yourself ??
Dear Mr Flake, You're a phony, sell-out no matter which clip you use. Signed, an angry constituent.
It's important to note that you won't vote for her but you never said you'd vote for Trump.  Her ad is valid.
Now you lost my support!!
Oh Jeff. So predictable.  The polls rise, and you're coming around to your Master.  Which is really too bad.
Trump and Clinton are both deplorable. Endorse Johnson! #LetGaryDebate #JohnsonWeld2016
flake is a looser! Can't wait to vote him out in AZ!
you know it's one or the other.
well Jeff F. Then go ahead and say you are voting for Donald Trump because no other vote doesn't.
- Also, who are you voting for?  You cut the clip short :-)
Too bad. I'm an Arizonan and I admire the way you've held Trump's feet to the fire. I might even vote for you.
@donnabrazile @SpeakerRyan @SenJohnMcCain Instead you will vote for a narcissist, woman hater, elitist..?
We warned u so often that u r being "used". Why r u now surprised?
But that wouldn't make a great commercial. A sane Senator saying he won't vote for his party's nominee DOES.
Hes not sane. #Arizona wants to get rid of IT. Plz. become a #Dumbturd,  #NeverHillary is calling!
Sasse/Flake or Flake/Sasse for 2020
You've got two choices: four more years of a Dem in the white house, or Pres. Trump. Hope you'll reverse course and endorse her.
Yes, plz do Jeffy boy. Go for ur corrupt liar. I think you should switch to a #Dumbturd, u fit in this group nicely!
lost all respect for you. Can't wait till you get voted out when your turn comes up.  You can go join Hillary in her lies.
