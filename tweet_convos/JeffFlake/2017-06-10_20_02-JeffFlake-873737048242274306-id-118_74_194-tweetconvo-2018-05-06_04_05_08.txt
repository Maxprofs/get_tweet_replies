Cuban govt blames embargo for its probs. Dissidents I met in Cuba sd lifting embargo wld expose this as a lie; prob is the govt
It's a lie they buy thru 3rd world comp. But gets go Foward with our neighbor! Cuba will be Owned by the Chinese Soon! Cuba is ready!
So your point is that the USA should renounce to all its ethical and democratic principles in order to own shares of Castro's Plantation???
There is Nothing ethical about Russian spies visiting Trump & his ppl or make his products.Exon paid Cuba Millions to guard wells.Ethical?
But wait You're one more troll What am I doing arguing with a faceless troll? Who pays you, Castro himself or he dies it through a nonprofit
No just a Regular Cuban that has been here go 50yrs & think it's time to move on.Too many have died & jailed. It's Open Up Cuba.
Who's payroll are you in, Abel Prieto's or Ramiro's Valdes?
Don't know any of those political ppl. I have been here Long enough & seen the suffering on both sides to speak for myself..I don't sell
How about posting something important like how the Republicans are trying to jam #AHCA bill through w/ no hearings?
"Will there be a hearing on the health care proposal?" Senator @clairecmc asked today in the Finance Cmte. You should watch: #Trumpcare 
Getting closer to Cuba won't favor Arizona's voters in any way. Any business opportunity with Castro's regime is a blatant fantasy
I look forward to you running as a Democrat in 2018
Thank you for being sane Jeff. And caring and honorable. Please do not support this man in the president's position. He is unfit dangerous.
Arizona is in bad enough shape already. #AHCA will make things worse.
I'm gonna say it - there is some real evil in claiming that 23m losing health care to pay for a $600b millionaire tax cut is a "rescue". https://twitter.com/vp/status/873610371818565635 …
As a Canadian who has traveled to Cuba, they really could benefit from American tourism, and it's a unique place Americas would like.
Those who have long supported.........Like Senator Marco Rubio and thousands of Cuban Americans ?
You're using the suffering of Cuban people to cover up your empathy with Castro's totalitarian and terrorist regime.
Thank you for being a voice of reason on this topic!
yes they do. Marco Rubio knows more than you Rino. Are you part of the Obama underground?

#stopthewitchhunt
maybe Marco Rubio knows better than you? You seem to be on the side of Castro and communism like a good Leftist.
Thank you Senator.  I hope the rumor is not true , but if it is , I'm still going back to Cuba again..on my own terms #resist
rejecting the rhetoric begins with you.
Do you know anything about the GOP AHCA? The majority of your colleagues don't. Maybe find out and if anything like we're hearing stop it.
How can I help you help change the Cuba policy? I need to visit again.

It is time for some bi-partisan legislation to ensure free travel of peoples between the United States and Cuba. #NoCubaTravelBan
You love the Castro tyranny
You are a communist lovef
vote no on trumpcare. Fix what's wrong with ACA.

So @JeffFlake you will do more than Tweet support for the current policy on Cuba? Pls DO something - don't let #trump undo Cuba policy
What you know about the Cuban people you communist lover
Thank you for talking/writing about policy and governance. Breath of fresh air.

How about how tough Americans have it with secret Republican healthcare bill? When will you care about us?

I appreciated your thoughtful words this morning with regards to US travel to Cuba. Thank you!
How about a comment on the secret #Trumpcare bill?

Dear Mr. #Flake ( @JeffFlake ) how much did #exxon pay you to say this? Enough for you to believe it? #climatechange 
Americans want ACA, not #Trumpcare!  Vote no, and listen to your constituents, or #VoteThemOut and lose your seat!
We need Medicare for All . Proposed by Bernie.
If you feel this way I, as an AZ resident, expect you to rally your colleagues to stop the president if he adds restrictions against Cuba!
DO YOUR JOB FLAKE. stop with your #mormonsandmojitos crap.  Arizona is sick of you and you're going to be voted out. #DumpFlake
Perhaps @JeffFlake could send exiled alpacas from AZ to Cuba to help?  Just spitballing here...
Vote no one ahca! AMA is against it. So is aarp
Can you publish the AHCA draft legislation instead of letting it proceed behind closed doors? You owe it to your constituents.
Please do not repeal Obamacare.  We must maintain Obamacare in good working order 
Agreed.  Continue more open and  better relations with Cuba.
US farmers seem to wanted expanded trade with Cuba. Googled "farmers Cuban trade"
Stand up for Arizonans , not for the Republicans.
How is cutting Cubans from economic opportunity helping democracy?
Don't AZ kids in foster care have it tough enough without you voting for AHCA & stealing their healthcare?
wow, something I agree with you on.  Now, vote NO on AHCA, all ACA needs is little fixing #stop party over country.  @a4agv
Vote for the #AHCA and you'll have to write "Don't the American People Have It Tough Enough?"

#ResistGOPcare
Yes they do and it's solely b/c of politics in D.C. The embargo should be lifted immediately!!
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT CUBANS! WE CARE ABOUT AMERICANS! HEALTHCARE, TAX REFORM, BUILD THE WALL. TAKE CARE OF US FIRST!
We do
What is your job? Worrying about the Cuban people or the people who elected you?
Change parties, sir. You no longer act or sound or live by the principles of a conservative. Consider that before you pontificate again.
So let's get this straight. Cuban people good, Castro bad. Russian people good?, Putin bad. Punish Russian people but not Cuban people?
Here's some sanity!
How about publishing, "How I took away Healthcare?"
personally I'm more concerned about AHCA being pushed thru the Senate the same way the twits in congress did. What's your stance on that?
you in congress people in Az have it tough. Say NO to the healthcare bill 13 old men r crafting alone
to continue the policy of isolation. I hope you will stand up to Trump since you know the impact of trade on AZ.
Anecdotal evidence shows no. Cuba is a vintage car collector's dream. They no longer pose a threat to this hemisphere. I see no reason
The Soviet Union is no more. Cuba used to get aid ( and missiles). Is Russia or any other country giving any aid to Cuba?
America first, Jeff. Let's deal with Russian sympathizers in the White House first then worry about Cuba. Oh, healthcare too...
Senator, you have your finger on the pulse.
Agreed. Now don't pull the rug out from the American people by voting for trumpcare.
My daughter just spent a week in Cuba with ASU as a photojournalist. They are great entrepreneurs. Opportunities abound for both US & Cuba
Wish you would worry a little more about the US.
Never mind publishing....... get something done in congress!!! Our standing in the world is sinking fast and youre writing a boik on Cuba???
They do have it tough.   Just one more reason not to reward the Castro Administration and possibly get real regime change as a result.
It's important to have less restrictions on Cuba - will create more jobs for Cuba and U.S.
Please Jeff, do not vote for the AHCA
#AHCA sucks. We don't want it.
write a letter to your president
Good. But nothing is more important than healthcare. Especially in Arizona, where healthcare is a major employer.
Are you an idiot? what about our health care crisis do you not get? or the pend criminal  investigations occurring? Are you kidding me?
I agree with your assessment. Thank you for your prudent, thoughtful position on this.
And now what is your stance on American People?  Are you standing against the secret GOP health care plan?  Planned voting before costing?
great point. how about you aid cuba with setting up a food bank and revise nafta to include Cuba in on the new deal.
Yes. Agreed. Travel to Cuba has made positive impacts for both countries.
We don't want Trumpcare. It's not what you promised for 8 years. Get the govt out of my healthcare senator.
GOP = GREED OVER PEOPLE.   Vote him out, abuse of power and supporting esponaige. He places party over country  #impeachtrump #VoteFlakeOut
Repeal Jeff Flake!!!
Yes. Let's not turn the clock back...on ourselves as well, Senator. Informed voters do not want Trumpcare. Work across the isle, please.
Surely you jest! Have yet to see democrats even look across the aisle let a lone lend a hand. It's their way or no way!
Actually, you don't have to look far.
Actually I looked even further  back
Note that this is an opinion piece. And...why is it always the attack? Do you have a clue what the current bill implies? You are ok with it?
Please don't vote for that healthcare plan.
Gosh if only you were in position, some kind of elected office perhaps, to ask questions or push an agenda
The president is kind of shit
Tell it to your leader.
I agree & hopefully you will see your way to voting against AHCA & the SNEAKY UNDERHANDED plan for rollout
Embargoes don't work. #FreePeopleFreeMarkets
we crushed them for 50 years,  generations.... guess you don't want to build your terrorists less than 90 miles from home after all.
