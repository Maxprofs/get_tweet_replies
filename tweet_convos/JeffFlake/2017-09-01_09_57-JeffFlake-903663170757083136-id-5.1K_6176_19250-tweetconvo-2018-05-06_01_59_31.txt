Republican congress called Obama's DACA unconstitutional, now you want to vote on it. No more amnesty.

MYTH: DACA is a program for “kids.” FACT: DACA is a jobs program for illegal aliens who are mostly in their 20s and 30s. #EndDACA
Kids on arrival. Attended R schools, learned R culture: respect & have benefited from R rights. They shouldn't be punished. #NotOurPatents
By the http://way.How  many of these so called Dreamers have u taken into ur Home?Do u support any with ur money?pay their rent?
They have lived with their parents kept their culture and language, and protest waving Mexican flags n signs Make America Mexico again.
If this is the motivation, it's time to shipped out ! Not ethical ! American culture should be left alone like any culture especially in US!
It's not right to forced  change others culture nor do they have the right to change the US , not right! Need to know the right US culture
Vote this man @JeffFlake out of office immediately!
no Congress needs to work for American kids
and that dear is why your approval rating is at 15% and you're gonna lose your primary @realDonaldTrump
Mr "FLAKE" please read @dbongino  reply to your steaming BS Tweet and UPDATE YOUR RESUME !! (Do the right thing and RESIGN )
They aren't "kids", and they're illegal aliens. Support the ones that are suffering citizens. Shill.
Yes, that's true. Does this mean you've changed your heart & mind and will work toward realistic, compassionate immigration reform? yes?
WHY? I can here legally, I had to wait my turn, do background checks, medical checks, finger printed , language . #Legalimmigration
Oh jeebus. Just look at your profile picture. #fascist
Thank you, Senator Flake, for having the courage to stand up for what's right.
DACA kids? Some of them are in their 30's. They had plenty of time to become citizens.
DACA needs to go down. Illegal from the start. You are a joke!
No they don't. Obama allowed thousands of DACA recipients to receive green cards leading to citizenship.  Democratic votes numskull.
How many years have you bunch of lazy, worthless politicians had to work on immigration reform?
Thank you
No offense but Congress needs to take action to protect Americans #DACA parents need to start the process to protect their kids. #MAGA
Stop ripping off our money.
This should not even be up for a discussion! #DefendDACA protect them because they are citizens of the USA entitled to all its privileges 
No, they literally are not citizens of he US.. they are residing here against the law.
Glad to see you're on the side of right.  Would that more of your GOP colleagues had your moral compass and strength of conviction.
A President doesn't have the authority to create laws and bestow benefits on millions of people who are here illegally.
This is a weird argument for you to make, presuming you're anti-DACA. 1. The president does have wide latitude over immigration.
2. The US has had a very fluid set of immigration laws over the last century and a half that often affect millions of people at a time.
3. That said, #DACA is the law of the land. We have already extended our welcome to millions of children.
DACA is not a law
It's a an executive policy
And as such is subject to adjustment by succeeding executives
Brought here without their knowledge...they were promised safety. Are we not as good as our word? They have done nothing but good.
Not true
thank you senator! despite some policy differences, i know for sure that the GOP is so much better in every way than the current POTUS
Right after #houston, #obamacare, #TaxReform, & other priorities.
#maga
Buh bye democrat flake. McCain at least lies about it when he is up for reelection. You are literally too stupid to see whats happening.
WHY HAVN'T "THE DREAMERS" BECOME AMERICAN CITIZENS?????? IT'S FREE FOR THEM~WE'RE BEING HOODWINKED BY THE LYING DEMOCRATS #EndDACA @POTUS
Hey Jeff~"The Dreamers" are holding signs that say, "F*ck Donald Trump"~HE'S YOUR @POTUS AS WELL~#IStandWithTrump
WHY HAVN'T "THE DREAMERS" BECOME AMERICAN CITIZENS?????? IT'S FREE FOR THEM~WE'RE BEING HOODWINKED BY THE LYING DEMOCRATS #EndDACA @POTUS 
Arizonans need to take immediate action and ensure you are never elected again. Voter for @kelliwardaz!
Time for you to be voted out of office, register as a bleeding heart leftist.
#DACA kids, go back home!
Some of them won't even have any memories of that because they were so young, but sure
asì es la vida
No they do not. But you will be voted out of office very soon
You are a joke. Please just switch to the Dem party. You don't fool anyone.
This affects many in AZ & some I know personally. Kids that have lived here since they were very young. US is all they know.
Pretty Damn sad I been asking help from you about agent Terry and FnF scandal but illegal are more important..your sad excuse
When are you going to admit you are a Democrat?
Start looking for a new career. Yours is over.
Americans need to take immediate action and not pay Congress' salaries. Let #DACA kids pay for it.
INDEED
Support Kelli Ward!
...isn't it customary to officially announce you've switched political affiliation, or do we just do it on the fly like you have ?...
And the newest member of the #Resistance stands
Let me guess, you're "concerned"
The only thing that concerns Flake is getting reelected.  GOP voters have deserted him, so he's sucking up to Hispanics.
Nah...we just need to eject illegal immigrants
Never thought We'd agree on anything, but just recently, you're making some sense. Thank You!
OUT OUT OUT #StopImmigration
Why? Perhaps you should develop that sense of urgency for: confirming 100s of nominees; tax reform; 0bamaCare repeal & deregulate.
END DACA NOW.  They DON'T consider themselves citizens - note NO American flag - plus she's laughing at Anericans who paid FULL tuition.
Well maybe if you had a 4.5 gpa and everything she had to qualify maybe you would get one too, stop crying because these daca kids work hard
To get the shit they have, and you just want it to be handed to you. Sorry not sorry
Why should we protect DACA kids?They are a drain on our system. No more freebies or discounts for them. Go Home! Let your own country give
Knowing he breaking laws, he gives Anericans the finger and dares us to deport. THAT is the face of a future gang member. END DACA NOW.
NO! We are a nation of laws.. Illegal aliens must go home #RuleOfLaw #EndDACA #NoDACA @POTUS @realDonaldTrump #Arizona Jeff Flake is a FLAKE
I'm part Cherokee.

When will you be leaving?
I'm not any part Native American, but I prefer yours to ours.
I'm definitely a Heinz 57. I've thought about doing that 23 and Me thing.
That's very cool!
Grow some, this is a moment to end #DACA and create a real path for #Citizenship. DACA is a fraud. #RecsindAndReplace.
You sure are a flake.
Hey flake, spend your money and house them in your home if it's that important to you.  We the people never agreed to this.
Who sent those unaccompanied minors Here?  Why should people who have problems feeding their own families be taxed for this.
We URGE YOU to #RescindDACA
#UnitedForFreedom
This is one of the reasons Frosted Flake will be out of the Senate soon.
Flake off Jeff!!!
Protect them by returning them and their parents to their home country. If they want to come back, then do it legal.
Absolutely correct.  Flake is a hypocrite.
No they don't.  You only want them for votes.  End DACA
Do you know what DACA is? I know several DACA folks who work tax-paying jobs and contribute greatly to our culture and society
I've employed many of them, and I can attest that they indeed do contribute a lot. I even set up their state and fed tax forms ;-)
They paid the same taxes you did, and possible more. I set it up in the system. They made about $65k year which was just ahead of market mid
Still waiting on you to sponsor legislation to save DACA and help Dreamers... the clock is ticking...
TRUMP SUPPORTERS DO NOT WANT DACA, IT TAKES AWAY FROM AMERICANS JOBS!! END THE ILLEGAL DACA, THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO REPLACE PEOPLE LIKE YOU
Thank you for standing up to the bullies. Please get this bill to save DACA done quickly!
Why?  They don’t belong here.
#ms13 ARE NOT KIDS!
You're kidding right? Are you seriously coming st me with that shit? You follow me. You know I will tear you a new ass. Are you that dense?
#DACA was made for young adults w/ potential willing to work/serve who couldn't afford,that is NOT what we received.Respectfully,tear away!
Do me a favor, if you're going to be an idiot don't backpeddle after making an idiotic statement. At least lean into your mental dysfunction
My statement remained the same, you jumped to kids and rapists...
Where were you when my son was killed in AZ?!?   Where's your concern for your fellow Americans? 
I am so sorry for your loss.
Thank you
It breaks my heart. I'm so sorry. I can only imagine. Such a handsome young man.
@kelliwardaz 47% @JeffFlake 21%
At this point I think it's pretty clear @JeffFlake doesn't want to win reelection or he's showing over & over again reasons why he won't be
And this is why I delete your fundraising emails.
Most of them are grown adults now and should go back and apply like legal immigrants.
Don't look now, but you're a member of Congress.
Get rid of these invaders to our country. Send them back to where they came from. Not our problem. US citizens are first. You don't get it!
Do it the right way:  https://www.uscitizenship.info/?r=bing-cpc-28197832-how%20to%20become%20a%20citizen%20of%20usa~25189281866$m=be-e$g=2820221413-7792345492&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=USC%3A%20US%20Citizenship%20-%20US%20-%20Search&utm_term=how%20to%20become%20a%20citizen%20of%20usa&utm_content=how%20to%20become%20a%20citizen%20of%20usa …
That program is corrupt.
Senator,
The People demand Legislation restoring Rule of Law, nullifying Obama's DACA Executive Order.  #RescindDACA  #UnitedForFreedom
Actually, we need to take immediate action to protect American citizens from you!
Why are they more important than American's
Nobody is suggesting that we "separate families". They all must return. Then if they want to come back, apply for a work permit.
Healthcare and Tax reform can wait, but helping illegals calls for IMMEDIATE urgent action?! You're so done come 2018
You will never be relected!
When are you taking immediate action to protect Americans hurting from Obamacare?
You career is done 
LOSER
Have you lost your mind?  No, just no.  Hope you enjoyed your limited time as a US Senator because you sure don't deserve to be re-elected.
You go Jeff  it is the right thing to do
Do your job follow the law
You sir are encouraging illegal and criminal activity. Shame on you!! A US Senator? maybe not for long.
#Mexico COULD BE GREATEST PLACE ON EARTH EXCEPT 4 #BrainDrain•#EndDACA #StopTheSiesta #GrowMexico•#BuildTheWall @realDonaldTrump•#MiRADIO
Agreed. Ship them home where they belong for their own good. Where they can help their fellow Latinos.
You're saying that these kids have been here for 20 years. Why haven't they applied for US CITIZENSHIP like everyone not Hispanic?
You are full of it, why don't you start worrying about American kids! Repeal Obamacare and tax reform is what you should worry about!
sweet photo!
this is why you will lose
You would hope but the GOP is complicit with Trump/Pence regime.

#TrumpRussia #VoteThemOut #Resist #KeepItPublic #NoWall #DefendDACA
You speak of CONGRESS as if you were outside looking in, Senator. Step up.
if Trump wrote up a law that banned abortions! Let it go on for 2 yrs then asked you to forget about it we'll just ignore the real law
Good job Senator
I wish Congress could take immediate action in getting rid of you!!!
And @kelliwardaz needs to start picking out wallpaper for her new office. #AmericaFirst #MAGA
Yes! And the "wall money" had much more pressing issues. This is tax payers money. We must have a say.
Yes, yes - fully agree!
@wins_USA Resign now, you RINO hack. How dare you betray the actual citizens of the US.
Don't be so treasonous.
@POTUS POLITICIANS MUST STOP ASKING THE PRESIDENT TO BREAK THE LAW, THIS IS HOW IT WORKS, FOLLOW THE LAW, CONGRESS WRITE LAW, FOLLOW ALL LAW
Idiots...take some immediate action on healthcare first
Your position shape-shift in this direction before an election tells me that you're trying to get the dem vote to save your traitorous skin
Flake IS a FLAKE!
Well at least your moral compass isn't completely broken....
CLASSIC virtue signaling.
Congress wasn't a part of Obama's criminal DACA activity when he EO'd it. Why should they get involved now?
Just donated to your primary opponent.
It's not what your constituents want POS RINO.
Mr Flake does not sound like someone who wants Rep his district, since he apparently has no time to respond to constituents. Out 4 himself
Your last ditch effort to get votes Flake? Sorry to tell you, YOU ARE DONE.
Bye
My great grand parents did not sneak into  this country. They came through Ellis Island were coal miners at a time we USA coal miners
Why aren't you this worried about American citizens?
Arizona needs to take immediate action to get rid of your A$$ ! Go @kelliwardaz
Americans took immediate decisive action to protect their children first. @realDonaldTrump must end #DACA
Enjoy your last months in office
US senator explaining why immigrants should be allowed to stay illegally.
What DACA kids???you mean grown adults don't you. They came here illegal. Send all families home together.
LOOKING FOR SOME ILLEGAL VOTES JEFF!!! DOWN 25 POINTS IN POLLS, YOU ARE DESPERATE AND STILL FLAKEY!!! LESSON LEARNED IS DON'T BASH POTUS!!!!
Arizona voters need to take immediate action and vote your dopey Liberal ass out!
You sound like Nancy Pelosi.
This is why u have to lose...DACA must end NOW..no more illegals..PERIOD.
You really have No idea why you are going to lose your next election, do you?
#Americafirst @JeffFlake
And you need to be replaced in 2018!
Go away leech!
Congress is incapable of action at any speed.
Glad I live in Wisconsin sheesh. You all so hateful
DACA, the "unaccompanied minors" flood, crack down on law enforcement against ILLEGALS is all a plan to create new progressive voting block.

You and Senator McCain are not Republicans. You both will soon be out a job. Traitors to your country.  No #daca
If the #DACA kids, who by the way are in their 20's & 30's now don't apply on their own w/out govt. assistance for US citizenship, end it!
How about we enforce the law?
Please do, this is important to get done today. #saveDACA
YES! But PLEASE no compromise on @realDonaldTrump Border Wall! Country is looking for leadership. Are you courageous enough to lead?
Maybe one day you will make Americans your priority rather than other countries' citizens, but not before we make you unemployed.
Congress needs to support the American people. We will wait no longer.
I'm so happy you're protecting illegal immigrants. Is that because you are afraid that you're house keeper prices are going to go up?
#Loser
They can be "protected" by returning to their own countries, not staying here as #IllegalAliens.
Flake~Obama could NOT get DACA through Congress,did Executive Order.Maybe U need to worry about yourself!  Arizona VOTE for @kelliwardaz 
It should stay, but it has to be earned@saveDaca
My kids HAVE a Dream But We paid for their college Not Taxpayers. My kids HAVE a Dream not to have Jobs opportunities Taken Away by illegals
Are you out of your mind?, you swore to support and protect our Constitution, what happened?.
So you don't believe in law enforcement? I care far more for unemployed Americans than I do non American citizens here illegally
They are here illegally, and need to leave. Come back when they've gone through the legal process.
800,000 jobs free to go to hard working, American citizens, once #DACA kids are gone. Sounds like a win win situation to me.
Pass a bill that President Trump will sign. Easy-peasy.
Hey Flake, this is one of reasons Dr. Kelli Ward is going to beat you. You are just like McCain.
Obama wanted to destroy America. Trump saved us from that date. But your trying to help obama finish it off. You hate Americans. @GOP
So you're more worried about ILLEGALS than you are CITIZENS? The very reason you will be replace come election day.
Go ahead traitor. We will push Trump to veto it
Actually we are taking immediate action to end you as well.  You're currently below third now...behind the independent candidate.  
Never her you liberals saying that about OUR KIDS! DACA WAS NOT AN EXECUTIVE   ORDER OR LAW,  OBAMA ADMIN. LET THEM IN.
someone needs to take immediate action to get you out of congress.
There's a diff. between an infant brought by his/her folks and a 14+year old MS-13 gangster who came illegally. DACA don't see it. Fix it.
You need to take immediate action and address 1. Victims of Houston, 2. Tax reform, 3. Healthcare--please get your legal priorities inline
You are wrong
You fruitloop.  Impeach yourself then delete your Twitter account!  We don't want #DACA.  What part of that don't you understand?
Don't #DefendDACA #EndDACA 
OR Be VOTED OUT

  Nation of Laws
Selling out the American people so the New York Times won't call him a racist.
Kids?
U will soon be voted out maga trump the best president everrrrrrrrr
DACA violates the US Constitution and 3 different federal statutes
So it's extremely urgent for Congress to protect DACA. Where is ur urgency/immediate action for Congress to help/protect ur fellow citizens?
Just so you know, I support @realDonaldTrump!  A border wall and reformation of our current DACA!  No more illegal immigrants!
What about protecting American kids?
You're nothing but a two-faced, lying, backstabbing, Liberal!
-U guys go 2 Capitol Hill & pick up the scum-disease. If they want 2 stay, then they need 2 become citizens-just like others do.
you mean make U.S. citizens tax payers pay,  you and bleeding heart lib politician scum who think it's your $$...what about us A.H.....
I know this is old "pap" but I gotta tell you, you have the most appropriate surname.  AZ can do better than you and dear ol' John.
How about protecting the legal citizens of the Untied States? Healthcare, Tax Reform, protecting our borders, building the wall, etc, etc?
30 billion in welfare ? All for a vote ? You are a fool.
Hey Flake, DEFINE kids... how many are over the age of 17? And gaming the system? You clearly have no idea.
What did they do before unconstitutional DACA?If you care so much then get to work!
