Did u have good discussion about your vote 2 kill people today?  Of the 83 comments on your TL, only 1 in support of u. What are u missing?
Vote NO on DeathCare bill today. I am an AZ voter and will do all I can to get you voted out of office if you vote yes.
I have been paying for my own health insurance since long before I became an "old ass"!
Sure, whatever, Linda.
Failing middle class means failing economy

#NeverFlake @JeffFlake we are going to run a campaign head and shoulders above any #rinos to #MAGA 
Corporate greed ,maybe they can advise you on protectionism exhibited by eu ,Canada,Mexico, China to name a few.
Could you stand with the millions of Americans who depend on the ACA for coverage today? #NoOnMTP
MBA students? What did you say to them, Flake? Be sure to sellout to Soros? Geezzzz!!!
Thanks for killing children and elderly to give $ to rich
My family depends on the ACA. This is not the right way to fix what's wrong with it. Please vote no.
Pretty soon your family wont gave any coverage from Obamacare
It doesn't solve anything, our problems as a country still there,neither you McCain R doing anything 2 help your constituents, that's sucks
Again your constituents have to travel cross country to see you face to face. After today's vote you might as well declare you're out in 18
Today I vowed to never vote for another republican politician & since I live in AZ will vote for any democrat who runs against Flake.
Welcome to the "party".
Shame
This is of no consequence!  Get with what you are being asked by your state.
Shame on you Senator for your #HealthCareVote today. Your constituents deserve better.
No tweets about healthcare? Are you hiding? So much for proudly standing up for Americans
Please put country before party. People before tax cuts for the wealthy. People are counting on you to VOTE NO. Your constituents come first
What is the Senate voting on today ?  Does anyone know ? Is McConel using smoke & mirrors to confuse Americans ? Vote no. Maintain Obamacare
DJT taking credit for Dow rise:GOP gave Reagan credit for Clinton economy his entire 8 years. This is still Obama's economy. #Impeach
No couch for KellyAnne Conway?
ASU MBAs are more diverse than the GOP house members.
BTW...#ASUSucks #BearDown

Tell them what a pleasure it is to rip health coverage from millions in the name of tax breaks for billionaires

VOTE JEFF OUT...

#KeepKidsCovered
Hear why pediatricians like @shriver_amy are calling their Senators to protect Medicaid & vote no on the motion to proceed. #KeepKidsCovered 
If you vote for the repeal with NO replacement, then you are voting YES for the deaths of thousands of American people. #VOTENO

The Democrats did little to Fix the  ACA, repeal and replace,  Allowed for alacarte Insurance packages
Flake works for the Koch brothers. His vote is for them. Not the people of america
#KochSummit
You're a Traitor to America!!!!!!

With very few exceptions, the Republican Congress isn't a party, it's a cult. Nothing will change until they're voted out of office.
I'll vote against @JeffFlake
Can't believe you voted yes. Fucking unbelievable.
WWJD?
SHAME!!
Can't wait to VOTE YOU OUT!!!!!!

Dear GOP,

#VoteNoMTP

Support for #MedicareForAll surges among Republicans!

Majority of low-income Repubs now support MFA: http://nyti.ms/2uQkTFI  #FridayFeeling 
Did you explain to them why it's OK for you and Senator McCain to have great insurance while stripping it from others?
you are disgraceful
#VoteThemOut #TheResistance


We'd love to have you visit Thunderbird School of Global Management - speak to our global master's students, we're now part of ASU, you know

Anne is a retired teacher in Colorado w/breast cancer. If this bill passes, her pre-existing condition would make health care unaffordable. 
A "Yes" vote today will ruin your political future in Arizona, and ruin the future of the Republican party.

Paula is an older Ohioan who will be forced to pay over $1000 more a MONTH if this bill passes. 
Glad you found time to meet with the students.  Did you have a chance to check your vm?  Vote NO on MTP/trumpcare.
No repeal! Skinny or otherwise. We're counting on you. Country over party. Please.
love the sundevils!  But can't believe you are going to vote to repeal our healthcare with who knows what?!
Vote NO. 2018 voters (including me) are watching. 
Please don't vote to strip health care from millions of Americans. 
Please protect our fellow Americans lives. 
Do the hard thing. be a Hero
Please vote NO on repeal of ACA.
Nice.  Now please put country above party and vote NO on the health care MTP
Sen. Flake, Will you put corporations ahead of people today and vote to remove 20 mil. people's ins? You should vote no until we see bill.
If He Votes for Trump care Worst piece of health care legislation ever Written He Loses his Job @LambdaLegal @SenSanders @WSJ @nytimes
Did you talk to them about the new technology that came out recently in 1886 called the battery. FYI, It holds energy for later usage.
Shame on you! Save healthcare!
Part of line of the ~200 physicians, activists, Medicaid enrollees entering the Capitol rn over TrumpCare. 

A few dozen arrests expected 
Did they explain to you how #ACA has created thousands of jobs and saved tax payers millions of dollars? #ProtectOurCare #SaveMedicaid
The plan for my family if you take away the ACA is divorce. I won't let my pre existing condition bankrupt my family. Married for 30 years
Now show these students what it means to have integrity by putting your country & fellow citizens before your own interests & party. Vote NO
Please please please fix the ACA! Don't just toss it out! Work with the democrats to make it better! You were elected to legislate try it!
Please don't abandon me and the rest of your constituents who rely on the ACA to purchase healthcare. Begging you to show us some empathy
Focus! Healthcare!!!!!! #NoRepealNoReplace
Did you remind them you don't care about their health or crippling student loan debt. Left that part out?
Vote "no" on the health care repeal!
Cool.  Now go vote "No" on the healthcare bill please.
I grew up in Snowflake & tho don't share all your politics, you've always done me proud, but if you vote yes you'll forever lose my respect.
You are another example of why Congress should only be paid $52,000 per year, @JeffFlake @ASU @WPCareySchool
Please vote NO!!!!!
How many of these MBA students and their kids, families will be out of luck if you vote for the MTP today for the healthcare bill? #VoteNO!
Hypocrite. Vote no on Trumpcare.
Great. No please go vote no on the motion to proceed. #VoteNoMTP
Since they're clearly educated, I hope they told you to vote no today!
Anything else interesting going on in DC today? 
P.S. Please phone home - I think you might have a few voice mail messages.
Please don't vote to repeal!

I’m standing with millions of Americans & thousands of NMs who will be hurt if Republicans get their way on #HealthCare. #AmericaSpeaksOut
