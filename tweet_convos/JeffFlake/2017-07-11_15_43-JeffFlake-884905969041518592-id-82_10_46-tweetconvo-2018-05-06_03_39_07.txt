Healthcare. How are you voting? I don't see your name in here as one of the 3 no votes. Why? & why won't you say?
Well @JeffFlake if u listen to ur TF, seems like maybe u care 2much about the wrong things & sounds like they want affordable healthcare.
Thank you! And thanks for standing up to Trump, & don't worry about his threat, he never spends his own money LOL

TY! This is BIG for AZ/West. Fed mismanagement of forests/watershed & #4FRI caused massive problems for forest health and the watersheds.

Under Ted Cruz's "Freedom Plans," (yes that's what he calls it) people w/chronic diseases pay more because of additional freedom. https://twitter.com/ericawerner/status/884491654715125767 …
If you want to restore forests, start by supporting climate change initiatives and opposing trumps anti-environment agenda.  #gimmeabreak

Having Balls   means it's OK to have enemies. Trump is toast!  Do the right thing vote NO.
Being right ahead of time means having enemies.

I'm cool with that.

…
I am outraged by the Trump mafia family! But I am even more outraged by YOUR SILENCE! You are so partisan that you have no moral compass!!!
Excellent. Your constituents would also appreciate a discussion about ur healthcare views
Is Elliott Lusztig correct in his assessment of your political party?
A "good discussion" would be a NO vote on ACHA senator!
Are you serious?Why are you not working on tax reform, health care and"Kates Law"?Why dont you tweet out your stance on these topics?
What's with the fluff and nonsense when the country is facing a clear and present danger . . . The President and his corrupt administration.
Get your paws off our National Monuments! Those belong to us!
Photo ops do NOT solve problems. Vote NO on the latest fake health bill then get to work improving the ACA and helping people.
Cruz amndmt you support would ruin my dad, just had two weeks in the ICU. 1st two days: $55k, but he has an annual cap. Don't kill us, HELP
i'm all about OUR public lands, but sen, please, #healthcare is *the* issue at hand... *please* vote NO on #BCRA



I'm pretty sure the first GOP Member of Congress who talks impeachment will not only win the Nobel Peace Prize—but will be an American hero.
You should ask him for a JOB after #2018, b/c I got a feeling @kelliwardaz gonna take yours #RINO. #MAGA #draintheswap #RepealAndReplace

Stop acting like you're working. Get to repealing Obamacare like you promised and avoid another Arizona 150% premium increase.

Innovation is great, please don't take away my health care.
You know the #BRCA is awful. Put constituents & country over partisan politics and VOTE NO. This is about OUR LIVES. #HealthCare #ACA
I am literally counting the days until I can vote you out of office...482 days.
So you are for healthy forests but not healthy citizens.  Seems in the USA we should have both. #SaveOurCare #NoBCRA
You were elected on FULL REPEAL of #Obamacare, not repeal and replace. If you and The other Rep Senators keep stalling, you'll be voted OUT
When will you address @POTUS collusion revelations with Jr's emails? You're on thin ice & your silence won't help.
But do you stand with your country or your party on healthcare?
You've been supporting and protecting an administration that colluded with Putin to hurt our electoral process.... what's wrong with you?

The Republican Party is to blame for everything that happens next—As long as they keep Trump in power-they are solely to blame for his acts.
Excellent source of good factual information. We need good data to make good choices facing a changing future
Sounds like an excellent way to connect with people. Please don't take away my health care.
 Real families don't have Senate privileges. Get your head out of your ass and vote NO on #WealthCare
My daughter was dxed T1 diabetic @ 2yo we kept same employee coverage all these yrs. She's now 19 will she go broke paying 4 HC as an adult?
Don't let cattle graze in public land
How can you support forest restoration with the current Admin killing off EPA. Further listen to your constituents & Vote NO on healthcare
How about healthcare restoration
Here's how your Trumpcare bill will hurt kids w/ disabilities here in VA. This will happen all over the country. http://bluevirginia.us/2017/06/sen-kaine-releases-report-medicaid-cuts-harm-virginia-public-schools …
You and your fellow GOP cohorts/co-conspirators/traitors are quickly becoming irrelevant. But you sit and talk BS with whoever you like.
2018... 
Healthcare bill as it stands is a Killer for AZ..

save yourself and Us... Vote no   #NoBCRA

America should have listened to the eagle. 

For those asking, best intel on final vote is next Thurs night/Friday morning.
Don't you get how much these tweets aggravate people? Get with it Jeff you're smarter than this

“There is nothing more pro-life than protecting the lives of those who are living.” “That’s a good point," he said. https://www.forsythnews.com/local/state-government/forsyth-constituents-air-health-care-concerns-sen-johnny-isakson/ …
Support our President!!!

All these innocuous tweets while a mob family is in White House When do you going to stand up for more than forests what about the USA?
Pointless tweet to distract from the fact that you plan to take healthcare from millions and won't even discuss it with your constituents.
Choosing a man crush with Lyin @tedcruz over healthcare for the constituents of Arizona.  Trumps toast! America needs a hero ur too chicken
Flake supports @tedcruz BS amendment to the healthcare bill.
Your attempts to seem relavent are sad. Our forests are important, but Putin is trying to annex the U.S. and you have no spine.
How long will Republicans stand by this president?How long will U sit on your hands.POTUS and family have committed treason.Don't u get it?
These are the actions of a REAL man 
Over recess, I held 5 town halls in some of the reddest parts of OR. Biggest area of concern among constituents? You guessed it: health care 
How nice to talk about saving trees while simultaneously being unwilling 2 talk about the action your party is taking 2 kill actual people.
You're such a joke. You were threaten by a treasonous mob boss to support an Cruz's death spiral admdt. Here's what you want for AZ:
It seems you care more about the health of the forest than my 52 year old diabetic wife, who needs affordable, quality healthcare.
tell Ryan the biggest criminal to child abduction and pornography is Russia mafia in AZ
forest are fine what about our health care fix Obama care Az has never been anti black so do not need to white was Obama legacy
You need to meet with us, your constituents, and tell us how you will vote #HealthcareBill .
No leadership on Healthcare, time to get to work Jeff
You should try discussions with AZ voters on the TERRIBLE #Trumpcare plan. Or just listen to all the calls/faxes and #VoteNoBCRA!
Vote no on trumpcare the Cruz amendment is worthless
Vote flake out he is a RINO
Your time in office will be over by next year. You are not for the people of Arizona
Vote NO on Deathcare Bill. Vote NO!!
I'm @JeffFlake and you only get to talk to me if you have $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ otherwise you are meaningless and expendable #mormon
Did Trumps threat to use $10 mil to run campaign against you make you agree to Cruzs amendment? Don't destroy Medicaid, affordable access
Out of hiding & back in DC you managed to dodge your constituents. Now I read you are backing Ted Cruz on healthcare. No votes for you.
If those constituents outside your door say they represent the Russian government, can they finally get a meeting with you and Don Jr.?
Welfare people can plant sapplings.

Amazes me you keep tweeting out bullshit, ignoring decisions to take away people's health care & arrest the disabled fighting for their life
But you're cool with the Cruz amendment so I'm enthusiastically looking forward to firing you.  Oh, btw, there is a traitor in the WH.
Any comment of Don Jr.?
So umm...what else is going on today, Jeff? Anything interesting?
