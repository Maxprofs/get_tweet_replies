@JeffFlake thank you for agreeing to vote NO on cloture this afternoon
If what you say was true @JeffFlake then our deficit wouldn't be falling so fast, we need to up spending for econ recovery @Rivers513
@JeffFlake @RightCandidates #Obamacare is the most important thing going on right now.  Cloture means you don't care #MakeDCListen #tcot
@JeffFlake So your issue is with the amount of spending and NOT with Obamacare? I assume you will be voting NO to the Cloture vote then?
@JeffFlake Thank You! #MakeDCListen

@DostoevskyGhost, @JeffFlake he owed conservatives that or he knows he will be primaried after immigration stance. @mflynny
@DostoevskyGhost @JeffFlake @mflynny If immigration doesn't pass all is forgiven but remembered. If does all bets are off. Sorry Jeff. U pay
@JeffFlake @brahmresnik Enough of the BS already
@JeffFlake didn't all 100 of you just vote for it? Or am I missing something?
@JeffFlake Thank you. It's imperative that the Republicans stick together.
@JeffFlake thanks for not caving on this one!
@JeffFlake helping this constituent gain access to my 2 boys in Israel will get you my full support #hagueconvention
@JeffFlake you have some work to do to regain my support but this is a positive step
@JeffFlake NO SURE BUT MAYBE THERE IS SOME HOPE FOR YOU!
@JeffFlake Then cut the rate of spending. Eliminate entire Fed agencies, programs & grants. What's wrong with you?
@JeffFlake thank you.
@JeffFlake Thank you for opposing cloture @SenTedCruz
@JeffFlake Dont quit on fighting Obama Care like our other Senator has announced. We need to cut spending. Be strong. Thank you.
@JeffFlake Yeah, you better act conservative for once, so you have a case when people mention the other times you threw away constitution.
@JeffFlake glad to hear you won't support cloture, but still ticked at you over GO8, this helps tho.
