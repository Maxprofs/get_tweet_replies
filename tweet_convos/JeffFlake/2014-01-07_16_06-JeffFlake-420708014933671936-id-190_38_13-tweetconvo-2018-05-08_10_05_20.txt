@whome51obama @JeffFlake And that's how GOP rolls: traitors all.
@whome51obama The DEMOCRAT party WORSHIPS Margaret Sanger who called blacks "human weeds" Hillary Clinton has a Sanger Award! @LiberalPhenom
@JeffFlake How does it feel to have your name be a punchline of a joke
RT @JeffFlake: Re Gates book. Extraordinarily bad timing, and form, if you ask me.
@jbendery Holy crap. Is this real life? Are Ds polling that well in AZ?
@Only4RM NO Problem is @JeffFlake is another BIG GOVERNMENT liberal who LIED and pretended to be Tea Party to get elected @jbendery
I wonder what Ambassador Stevens would say, @JeffFlake.
@JeffFlake No one asked you!
When is a good time to tell us our leaders are too political? @JeffFlake Re Gates book. Extraordinarily bad timing, and form, if you ask me.
WTH is wrong with AZ leaders anyway?  @RichardGrenell @JeffFlake
@Nayrue  @JeffFlake  wish I knew what was going on with AZ SENATORS. both have become squishy. House's R's are strong
@azgrizzly Become? They always WERE squishes Flake did LIE though, before winning the Senate Too bad can't be recalled! @Nayrue @JeffFlake
“@JeffFlake: Re Gates book. Extraordinarily bad timing, and form, if you ask me.”
It's never a bad time for anyone to call #Obama out. He is more a threat to America's safety than Robert Gates' book.  @JeffFlake
@JeffFlake Great job of kissing Obama's ring and throwing Gates under the bus. Is Flake your name or your reputation?
@JeffFlake bad form?  Putting politics before the lives of our military personnel
@JeffFlake is an uber RINO

AZ can do so much better than this Putz
@JeffFlake YOU have extraordinarily BAD timing, and form in not giving Mr. Gates message a chance. Could you be more Squishy? Is that John?
@JeffFlake Lame.  Bad timing is sending 30k American troops to war, setting up to fail and making decisions for political reasons only.  JJ
@JeffFlake No-one is asking you
@JeffFlake Very disappointed in you...sort of makes me regret giving you my vote...if you ask me
@JeffFlake read your facebook explanation - still don't agree.
@JeffFlake no one asked, but great tweet. I'll remember it when you vote for amnesty.
@drewmatich Too bad @JeffFlake and the rest of his amnesty shills can't be removed from office, indicted for TREASON, tried, and CONVICTED!
@JeffFlake Nobody asked you. Take your lips off Obama's ass now... Thanks... #1termflake
@JeffFlake No one asked you, you treasonous amnesty shilling bastard! Resign you democrat pretending to be a "republican"! You're a FRAUD
@JeffFlake Jeff, what does the Obama administration have on you that you defend them and vote with them? Nude pics? Mistress? Boyfriend?
@JeffFlake = Puke!
@JeffFlake Well, you are consistently a Flake.  You sure wouldn't want the US people to know the truth about the Divider-in-Chief.
your idiocy is beyond boring; bugger off backstabber RT @JeffFlake Re Gates book. Extraordinarily bad timing, and form, if you ask me.
.@JeffFlake You and @SenJohnMcCain have become a major source of embarrassment for AZ. Next time, try counting to 100 before responding.
@JeffFlake exactly when is a good time to accurately report the dismal presidency???
@JeffFlake Yeah, 'cause nobody knew that Obama makes decisions based on politics until Gates blew the lid off it.
@JeffFlake Is it bad timing and form to ask you why you slavishly follow John McCain, instead of representing your constituents?
Re Flaketweet. Extraordinarily bad tweet, if you ask GOP. RT @JeffFlake Re Gates book. Extraordinarily bad timing, and form, if you ask me.
This is the problem with Washington. Incompetence and worse govern US foreign policy and @JeffFlake complains it's bad form to say so.
Polishing your horn, RINO? Go suck an egg. RT @JeffFlake: Re Gates book. Extraordinarily bad timing, and form, if you ask me.
@JeffFlake You're just a moronic senator. Why would I ask you anything?
@JeffFlake Flake off.
When did anyone ask you? When is a good time for honesty? There is a bad time? @JeffFlake
@JeffFlake Bad timing because it makes amnesty more difficult for you to pass when accurate criticism of the Dem leadership and WH is aired?
@JeffFlake Hey douche bag...nobody asked you, so STFU. Not everyone can claim to have a last name that is so accurately descriptive.
@JeffFlake And You SOLD your soul for how much? How many laundered tax dollars did Soros buy it for?
Never a bad time for honest criticism about failed leader. RT @JeffFlake Re Gates book. Extraordinarily bad timing, and form, if you ask me.
@JeffFlake Why Not. OK I'll play - How bad timing and form?
@JeffFlake You guys never think that it's a good time to tell the truth do you?
@JeffFlake Not aware that anyone asked you for your opinion on anything. Proffering an unsolicited opinion is truly bad form.
@JeffFlake You couldn't be more wrong. Mr. Obama has let us all down with his abysmal foriegn policy. Its a tragedy.
@JeffFlake a predictable opinion coming from the likes of you.
@JeffFlake You have a future with the NYT.
@JeffFlake Pretty much in-sync with this administration wouldn't you say?
@JeffFlake Nobody asked you, fyi
@JeffFlake Truth hurts, eh? I applaud Mr Gates and his honesty.
@JeffFlake Nobody asked you. BTW, truth dissemination shouldn't be about timing. Be prepared to be voted out.
@JeffFlake Political ettiquette has cost this nation $17.2 Trillion!! It's about time people in D.C. start speaking the truth!
@JeffFlake Don't understand your comment, short of waiting 3 years, when would be a good time?
#ImpeachObama #GOP #NoAmnesty #treason #liberalFAIL @JeffFlake It's never a bad time for the TRUTH.  Please explain your bizarre statement.
@dmbatten @HickoryStonewal @JeffFlake good solid advice
@JeffFlake  obama is bad form. Notice you didn't claim it was untrue
@JeffFlake  i voted for u #rino but no more run as a democrat next time,u won't #piss-off so many people.
@JeffFlake You doing the RINO dance again! All you need is some La Caracha music.
@JeffFlake Gates is just speaking out to the absolute failure that Obama has become domesticaly and tragically for our patriotic troops
“@JeffFlake: Re Gates book. Extraordinarily bad timing, and form, if you ask me.” He has John McCain RHINO-itis
.@JeffFlake Sir, what are you thinking with this tweet? I'm thinking I wasted $ and energy helping you get elected.
@JeffFlake You embody all that is wrong with politicians and DC Mr. Flake.
@JeffFlake Would it have been better timed prior to 11/6/12? Otherwise, what on earth are you talking about?
@MathewSHarrison @JeffFlake They've all been neutered...
@MathewSHarrison @redcat0827 @JeffFlake I don't think they forgot, most have been in Congress so long, they think they can do no wrong.
@JeffFlake Yes, because we certainly wouldn't want to criticize the Party of decency and civility. #Derp
@JeffFlake Who asked you?
@JeffFlake Don't recall asking you RINO.  For anything.  Other than your resignation.
@JeffFlake has been hanging around the Sr Sen from AZ too much just STFU
@JeffFlake Speaking of bad form....
Nobody asked you @JeffFlake  RINO boy.
@JeffFlake Gates told the truth, unlike u. Then again ur a progressive, nuff said! #RecallFlake
@JeffFlake  Of all the things you stay silent on, you decide to say something about this?  Weird and bad form IMO.
Okay so the NSA has pics of you and justice Roberts at the donkey show in tijuana, big deal. @JeffFlake
@JeffFlake Well, don't recall anyone asking you.
@JeffFlake: your tweet is in bad form if you ask this Arizonan who will not vote for you again #goodriddance
@JeffFlake 
who asked you?
Living up to your name & emulating McCain again? @JeffFlake Re Gates book. Extraordinarily bad timing, and form, if you ask me. #1TermFlake
Thanks to @JeffFlake for being such a good DEMOCRAT
@JeffFlake Honestly, Senator, whose side are you on?
@JeffFlake you can leave him one star on Amazon becuz of his timing and not checking with u, but it won't mean much if u don't buy the book
F'ing disgrace! Bought & Paid 4! Hope $ are worth your soul!=>@JeffFlake Re Gates book. Extraordinarily bad timing, and form, if you ask me.
@JeffFlake "Bad form" to describe Obama honestly? When would be better? Remind me why I supported you?
@JeffFlake Whatever you say @RepPeteKing @SenJohnMcCain Uber RINO's
@JeffFlake really who GAF what you think. You're part of the problem.
@JeffFlake To argue with a person who has renounced the use of reason is like administering medicine to the dead (Thomas Paine)
.@JeffFlake So, planning on being a one term Senator, hmmm?
@JeffFlake You've got your own bit of bad form to be explaining to your conservative constituents, sir. Hopefully you'll be replaced.
@JeffFlake wow when you Mormons go to WASHINGTON, you lose all sense of moral principle! Or maybe you have just been hypocrites all along!
@JeffFlake and you're extremely dissapointing. You think everyone should ignore blatantly political decisions because of bad form? Yeesh.
@JeffFlake your a disgrace and truly a flake
@JeffFlake<--------- Would someone please primary this idiot?
@JeffFlake News Flash...no one did.
@JeffFlake We should have known about Obama playing politics with our soldiers lives and HIS bad form BEFORE 2012 election not after.
@JeffFlake It's interesting that a #frenchrepublicans like yourself continue attacking both conservatives and people who criticize Obama.
Flake lives up to his surname. Gates and Yellen in one day. Didn't he once favor term limits? Good idea for him. @JeffFlake #tcot
@WRogersM @JeffFlake <Huge disappointment
I intend to ask my AZ friends to consider removing you from office as soon as possible. Maybe I'll move there & do it myself.@JeffFlake
@jeffflake Actually, the timing couldn't have been better. Maybe the administration will wake up and change course. #DisastrousForeignPolicy
@JeffFlake You don't think American public has the right to know more about their president?Keep it all hush, hush, right?Disappointed in u.
“@JeffFlake: Re Gates book. Extraordinarily bad timing, and form, if you ask me.” Agreed.
@JeffFlake Who asked you for your opinion.. #suckstobeu #DrainTheSwamp You included. #tcot #ccot #pjnet #orpuw #tgdn
@JeffFlake Like the issue crawfishing you did on the voters who elected you to office?  Because that was extremely bad timing and form, IUAM
@JeffFlake Don't you have some borders to open?
@JeffFlake Nobody asked you, cock-munch.
@JeffFlake Nobody asked you, flake. Aren't you supposed to be an R? #sellout
Heh. When would it be a good time to do so? -> RT @JeffFlake Re Gates book. Extraordinarily bad timing, and form, if you ask me.
@JeffFlake @allahpundit Yeah. It should have been released before Nov. of 2012.
@JeffFlake Mr. Gates apparently has forgotten that his country is still at war with our soldiers lives on the line evry min of evry day.
@JeffFlake I'm now officially embarrassed to call you my senator. Defend Obama, lose my vote. Just that simple.
It's horrible form to place politics over national security RT@JeffFlake: Re Gates book. Extraordinarily bad timing, and form, if you ask me
@JeffFlake That's funny, because I don't recall asking you. #obamafail
@JeffFlake Right, because there's never a good time to question whether our president could be methodically going about destroying the state
@JeffFlake You had us all fooled Jeff, run as a dem next time. What a let down you have been.
@JeffFlake you can remove your tongue from Obama's back passage any time you like chief #asskisser
.@JeffFlake RINO moron
@kyleraccio Is everybody a RINO moron these days?  Come on @JeffFlake. This is why the party is freefalling.
Oh shut up, you pompous throne-sniffer. RT @JeffFlake: Re Gates book. Extraordinarily bad timing, and form, if you ask me.
@forewit @JeffFlake there will never be a good time to criticize Obama for many. But it was brave to bash Bush. Ugh.
@JeffFlake @MelissaTweets Jeff, can't take a thing you say seriously. You've been on the wrong side of almost every major issue
.@JeffFlake Evidently...so was your election.  #AZvoter regret
@JeffFlake Well, when WOULD be a good time to take on Obama? B/c you nutless wonders in the #GOP won't do it. #EpicFail !!
@JeffFlake .truth is truth.  We will be voting in 2014 and we will sort out the truth for ourselves
@JeffFlake Who asked you?
@JeffFlake    you should be reading the news off a teleprompter in the greater Tucson area not sitting in the US senate #senatortedbaxter
@JeffFlake @mattklewis Don't you think it would be extraordinarily cowardly for a leader to bite his lip on matters on national defense?
@JeffFlake @mattklewis. Stop kissing O's butt Senator!
@JeffFlake timing, you mean during another vacation? or a time when the economy stinks, or?
@JeffFlake Hahahaha you are such a tool.
@JeffFlake Of course your punk ass would ya worthless piece of shit.
@BigDSmoke @JeffFlake do I detect a titch of anger at mr pondscum?  Ha
@shereedre10 @JeffFlake Lol yeah just a tid bit!
@JeffFlake Your tears make me want to read it.
“@JeffFlake: Re Gates book. Extraordinarily bad timing, and form, if you ask me.” Who asked you?
@JeffFlake @MelissaTweets Jeff Flake, an extraordinarily big douche, if you ask me.
@JeffFlake @MelissaTweets In what way? That he did not publish this in the Summer of 2012? Or that he tells the truth?
RT|“@JeffFlake: Re Gates book. Extraordinarily bad timing, and form, if you ask me.”| Critical of critics?
@JeffFlake A few days after Fallujah was retaken by AQ seems rather appropriate, imo
@JeffFlake @allahpundit Agree. It should have come out ahead of the '12 election. Now what good does it do?
@JeffFlake @MelissaTweets Very odd.
@JeffFlake at what time are we the people allowed to know the truth?
.@JeffFlake @MelissaTweets .That pesky little freedom of speech thing bothers you?
@JeffFlake @allahpundit If by bad timing you mean why Iraq is falling to  Al-quieda, Iran gets nukes and Afg. Goes to the Taliban, then yes.
@JeffFlake So, were you equally outraged at The Price of Loyalty by Paul O'Neill during the 2004 election year?? @mattklewis
Well then... RT @JeffFlake: Re Gates book. Extraordinarily bad timing, and form, if you ask me.
@JeffFlake @mattklewis why Senator?
@JeffFlake @MelissaTweets wish we could bet on if Gates gets audited @instapundit
@JeffFlake Why not whip up some righteous passion for your Constitutional Oath? The Senate cafeteria seating seems more important to you.
Awwwwww... @JeffFlake
@JeffFlake Nobody asked. @allahpundit
@JeffFlake @allahpundit No one asked you.
Arizona Senator: it's bad form to call out politicians' antics @JeffFlake: Re Gates book. Extraordinarily bad timing, & form, if you ask me.
@RichardGrenell @JeffFlake Wholeheartedly disagree.
RT @JeffFlake: Re Gates book. Extraordinarily bad timing, and form, if you ask me.
@JeffFlake note everyone in DC check with Jeff before you publish a book!
@JeffFlake @mattklewis Explain why, please.
@JeffFlake @allahpundit We didn't.
@JeffFlake: Why? @mattklewis 

#tgdn #tcot
“@JeffFlake: Re Gates book. Extraordinarily bad timing, and form, if you ask me.” Why, because NO ONE is allowed to question this prez?!
Interesting take from Arizona Republican ---> @JeffFlake Re Gates book. Extraordinarily bad timing, and form, if you ask me.
“@JeffFlake: Re Gates book. Extraordinarily bad timing, and form, if you ask me.” Sure wish you & McCain would be honest and run as Dems!
@JeffFlake Who asked you?
@JeffFlake who asked you
@JeffFlake no one asked.
Agree! Book should have come out before re-election. @JeffFlake Re Gates book. Extraordinarily bad timing, and form, if you ask me.
@JeffFlake when would be a good time?
@JeffFlake My real question is that what has happened to our @GOP in DC right now?  You're losing your way in politics & govt! Big shame!
@JeffFlake This POTUS has made a mess of our foreign policy! More troops have died since he took office, a fact being shoved under the rug!
.@JeffFlake  USA Thanks GOD that someone in DC is speaking out just what is going on in this corrupted anti-US Military WH now.
.@JeffFlake Ok..We'll just release books that make arguments you don't like when you say it's ok.
@redsteeze @JeffFlake It's like campaigning on something than doing a volte face after being sworn in. That kind of bad timing and form.
@redsteeze @JeffFlake Or switching "than" for "then" because of a fast and sloppy rewrite.
@JeffFlake Why...when the truth needs to come out about the worst POTUS we've ever had! He has put America in more danger than ever!
Hmm. RT @JeffFlake Re Gates book. Extraordinarily bad timing, and form, if you ask me.
