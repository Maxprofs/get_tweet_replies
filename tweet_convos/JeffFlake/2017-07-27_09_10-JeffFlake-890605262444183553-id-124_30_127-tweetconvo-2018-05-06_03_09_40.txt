#ObamaCareFail healthcare that works for only 4% of the country isn't an effective healthcare. #repeal
9/11 First Responders had your backs too.. but GOP repeatedly voted down supplemental health care assistance. Why?
When will you have the backs of Arizona & stop kissing McCain ass. He bought your seat . Both of you are corrupt. My $ is against you.
HHAHA! They had your back!? OK, but what are you doing about the #SethRich murder investigation?
Why not make DC a state so it isnt like they always got to beg?
JEFF FLAKE as TRUMP's BIGGEST SUPPORTER, do you stand with him encouraging police brutality?
You are a FLAKE IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE! Pathetic RINO!!!!

You are toast!
It's a shame you didn't have our backs on the vote tonight. Good luck in 2018.
You have multiple personality disorder. You vote to take healthcare from people to give money to the rich and then float this like you care
Congress sure doesn't have us regular Americans backs. Quit backstabbing your constituents. vote for us, not your own interests. #norepeal
vote no on tonight's healthcare bill and have the backs of Arizonans & Americans and don't leave us w/ no healthcare and bankruptcy;
These are exactly the type of people you would rip healthcare from. Every day working Americans
Taking healthcare from millions who need mental health services forces police to be the mental health svs-have their back & vote NO on BCRA
SOS  #STOPTRUMPSTWEETS
Have my back! Vote no on healthcare bill and support planned parenthood. After all I can vote for you or not
Don't support this reckless and dangerous process and bill. VOTE NO on Skinny Repeal!
Yes they are brave men & women. Where is your concern for the poor, elderly, sick, & disabled. #SkinnyRepeal Doesn't fix problems w/ ACA.
Senators know exactly how the process works & they know their skinny bill will be merged w/ the bill from House, which decimates Medicaid.
You are a joke. Worried about this while you screw over your constituents. Get a backbone.
Quit stalling Jeff.
Yaaaawwwwnnnn!
Vote NO on skinny repeal! 15 million many from AZ will be kicked off insurance and premiums will rise 20%! Horrible for citizens & economy!

CALL @JeffFlake and demand he #VoteNO on "skinny repeal." This will raise premiums & hurt Americans and Arizonans alike! 202-224-4521 
Have you asked Democrats across floor for amendments to ACA. I'm sure not.
No reelection for you, corporate shrill.
no Trumpcare 4 them. You all need to abide by the same healthcare you vote for your constituents.  How about you do an amendment for that?
#Shameful  Call 844-432-0883 and tell him to vote NO! He's voting tonight!

Well deserved but too bad you don't want the best health care for your voters.  shame on you.
CALL @JeffFlake and demand he #VoteNO on "skinny repeal." This will raise premiums & hurt Americans and Arizonans alike! 202-224-4521 

So did a lesbian who is also black, she had your back..do u have hers in allowing her all the rights she deserves?

Senator, cutting Medicaid will decimate AZ AHCCCS resulting in loss of healthcare jobs and people suffering from lack of medical care.
U can approve Taxpayers $ 4 a useless Wall & (so far) $42 million 4 @realDonaldTrump trips & family trips YET can't invest in Healthcare!?
You are deflecting from larger issues. As the numbers of disenfranchised increase- civility doesn't just erode. It becomes desperate.
How can you say you have their back when you want to strip healthcare. You're not thinking with your brain man! #voteno
Good. Do NOT vote to take health care away from millions of American citizens. FIX ACA, do NOT strip away any part of it. 2018!! AZ voter.
Do you have your constituents' backs on health care? Please don't take away my health care.
The Capitol Police are serving their country. You, not so much.
Total respect for those officers. They deserve our support.
But have you forgotten you have constituents at home w/ pre-existing conditions?
Vote No on Healthcare. Perhaps if you don't strip away mental healthcare, future shootings can be avoided.

#Trumpcare No 

#SaveACA
If you really care about them, protect their pension or at least lift the mandatory retirement at 57 to allow them to get to age 62
Be nice if you had your constituent's back, Jeff, but that's just too much to hope for.
How about healthcare that doesn't eliminate millions and kill the AZ economy vote against ur tribe and vote for ur people which is all of AZ
Well who is going to have OUR backs - do you have any idea how badly @GOP efforts to repeal the ACA is scaring people, do you have any clue?
The Democrats Strategy, they have abandoned their Constituents and Done ZERO to do improve the ACA from complete collapse
Yesterday you voted for 2 bills which cause tens of millions to lose healthcare. Where's your statement about that? #Trumpcare

#StayLoud & #StopTrumpcare. Call @SenateGOP: 844-432-0883 & keep calling. 

#Shame. But this isn't over. CALL: 844-432-0883 & demand @senrobportman #StopTrumpcare. h/t @FamiliesUSA 

You can't repeal the ACA without taking away 32 million people's health care. http://bit.ly/2u5rZ7K  

Our meeting with @RepRaskin and @InNowOrg ! Thanks to the representative for being a friend to the disability cause! @NCILAdvocacy 


Today is the day. @SenateGOP will have a "final vote" sometime in the next 24 hours on a bill. Which bill? We don't know.

Not a single one of the GOP proposals:
Covers more Americans
Makes health care more affordable
Spares Medicaid from devastating cuts 

Several Republican & Democratic Governors wrote us last night to say they oppose the GOP’s ‘skinny’ bill: http://time.com/4875870/governors-letter-skinny-repeal-obamacare/ …

Circle logic: GOP says w/o mandate people will "choose" to be uninsured. But that's BECAUSE repealing mandate makes insurance unaffordable.
why won't you stand up to Trump? he is denigrating our country, our military, our law enforcement, and our constitution.

House bill. 
Senate bill. 
Repeal & run. 
“Skinny repeal”…

2 Republican women did the right thing & voted NO

Collins & Murkowski put people over party.

…

US Military spends $84 million/yr on ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION drugs. Gender-related treatment is $2.4-8.4 million/yr. Don't lie to us.
