#Flake2020
We like the 9th circuit as it is.
Im with you!!!!
If a court doesn't agreed with you you want to separate from it? WOW - I'm mad!
Only YOUR bill senator, or did you have some help? I'd pat you on your back but your hand is in the way.
You are going to lose your seat. U didn't listen to ur voters. U voted for all the looters. U can't be trusted. #TheResistance
You will be voted out of office. Huckabee is a quack who thinks he's a Christian..#TheResistance
Wow!  you preached to the choir and it was well received!?  When's that town hall?  #DoYourJob
I want to be at a Flake-McCain town hall.  I would bet money they won't show up
flake hasn't been to one in a year
He is too much of a coward to show up! I will attend his concession speech
only 624 days give it take untill November 2018
Birds of a feather, Flake together? We're watching you, Jeff! You're gutting fair pay out of legislation!
how about you try to work with them instead of breaking up everything
lol Fox News is your "great" endorsement???  Do you realize you have liberals living in ARIZONA????
You're really doing your best to accelerate this death spiral, aren't you?
don't worry, I contacted @kyrstensinema to see if we can start promoting her now #nevertoosoon #2018
Excellent idea! #flakeout2018
Well, actually, @deedra2018’s a better choice, as she doesn’t support @NSAGov #spying.  #4A #4thAmendment #4thAmendmentRights #FourthAmendment #FourthAmendmentRights
2.) If Huck says it's raining, I'd look outside.
He lives in a bubble of "faith" based vitriol and fear.
Blatant party power grab and attempt to politicize courts. Don't turn us into the US of Bannon. #IamTucsonVoter
Im  with you. They sounded like idiots to me. Pls investigate Soros and the paid protestors
try asking some lawyer who practice in these courts what we think Mr. Flake!
- This is an immoral and partisan attack on the separation of powers and our system of checks and balances -- angry AZ resident!
no wonder he is a loser commie like you vote Flake out he is a true flake for AZ
@dogoodthings77 @GovMikeHuckabee - finally something positive from you, Mr. Flake
Honorable Officials, sir's, you attack on the 9th circuit is  it's self hypocritical. Write better laws.
oh my goodness have you lost your mind? Your voicemail box is full, answer your damn phone.
#hahahaha by #FauxNews the Teapublican #FakeNews
We don't want the 9th Circuit broken up, leave it alone! Do you ever listen??
You are seriously bragging about an endorsement? From Huckabee? You don't have a damn thing to brag about. 2018
You have larger issues to deal with like looking for your next job! Shouldn't have voted for Sessions and DeVos!
2018 will soon be here! We want a Town Hall! NOW!
Please hold a town hall soon so we can begin your performance review before you're fired in 2018
@AZAgainstTrump @JeffFlake @GovMikeHuckabee agree!
Why is Senator Flake afraid to face AZ voters? 
same reason he's afraid of the 9th Circuit. #VoteFlakeOut
Keep AZ in 9
--when is your next town hall?? you have serious explaining to do--your continuants r NOT impressed & you know it!!
Flynn. Russia. Trump. What do you plan to do about it? Grin and bow?
You're publicly aligning yourself with Huckabee?!?
My question is how about YOU fill the vacant seats first.
GOP has hobbled the courts yet complains
same old song
--do your jobs--check your President & stop undermining the our legal protection!! Do your job & represent AZ
On Sunday you said "we need...judges that recognize the separation of powers, and also legislators that do..."  Clearly you don't
lets break up more American institutions and replace them with Russian ones.
Both sitting democrats and republicans needs to be removed from office. A reboot of the government is needed.
Remember Flake is up for reelection. Don't forget he voted for DeVos
@SenJohnMcCain Jeff Flake, I can't wait to vote you out of office in #midterms2018 #ConfirmMerrickGarland
Gerrymandering the 9th circuit is wrong @RepAndyBiggsAZ 
This bill contradicts your statement on Face the Nation that U defend judges, it is an attack on the judges of the 9th. Dishonest
You are damaging our system of checks & balances and creating a dictatorship. You're impatience is destructive.
boy, you picked a winner to support you.  When's that town hall meeting?
Agree #Immigrationreform NOW Travesties happening NOW!
#Huckabee no! Good job on Face the Nation. #Humility
GET BANNON OFF SECURITY COUNCIL
TRUMPS TAX RETURNS, RUSSIAN CONNECTION, GERRYMANDERING, FLINTSTONES WATER, ......GET TO WORK
Gerrymandering is not enough, now you must control the courts. Shall we call this the 4th Reich?
Why does Huckabunch need to be broken up from the #9thCircuit? Your sentence structure sucks.  @GovMikeHuckabee
{blink} @JeffFlake @GovMikeHuckabee
more like a sad one.
Cite Alexander Hamilton &over reach by 1 judge/1 branch 2 disband 9thcc. ALL 9/11 Terrorist had issued visas!
about some of those conservatives circuits? You favor breaking those up also, or just ones that rule against you
you both disgust me.
Quick to berate Trump. Where were you & fellow RINO's when Obama undressed the SCOTUS during St. of Union. FLAKE
When will you be having a town hall meeting in Arizona Senator Flake.
of course Fox is in favor of gerrymandering the courts. At best exaggeration at worst lies.#flakeout2018
Senator, you should not be celebrating @GovMikeHuckabee's endorsement on anything.
Now we are going to try to fix
The circuit courts. As in controlling them? Stack SCOTUS and the 9th.Go GOP!!
you sellout, we will not forget the DeVil vote.


what did you know and when did you know it

Arizonan's looking for #AlternativeToFlake 2018
what a terrible idea  learn the LAW gentleman
you are on your way out #2018GTFO #goingtohell #greed #greed #greed
Whattttt? Mikey who???? Really, Jeff! We knew this job would be challenging for you... but????
Judicial gerrymandering, nothing more. If sincere, propose something that makes geographic sense.
I am all for breaking up the ninth circuit Court. It is way too big and handles too many cases.
You just want to get away with more assaults on freedom! Hell no we won't go! #keep9thcircuit
You have every right to be worried about 2018. You are NOT doing your job for the people of Arizona #VoteOutGOP
I thought you were one of the reasonable ones. So disappointed. Unfollowing you.
Great. You'll be getting endorsements from Breitbart next...
town hall?? I'd love to tell you why I'm switching to republican to help vote you out.
especially since your phone line never picks up and the voicemail is always full
Fox endorsements are endorsements for the opposition. What are the non partisan facts for splitting the 9th?
only he is not from Arizona and frankly we don't care for him here
I just donated to the campaign that will fight against you next year!!!
Why not fill 9th vacancies and increase number of judges like AZ did in our Supreme Court? Then it would be more "balanced."
@SenJohnMcCain Republicans stopped by court on #MuslimBan then push bill to break what @FoxNews calls 'nutty 9th Circuit' court
wots the real reason for this? All you will accomplish is more judges to say no.
congrats you fooled me with your anti Trump talk I thought you were fair and balanced. I feel like a fool now
"Get your Chuckleheads folks!"  "We got Chuckleheads!"
keep standing with trump jeff. you'll be gone before you know it. mike huckabee is deplorable
do you have any bipartisan support, Senator?
I don't want any AZ-related actions affiliated or endorsed by whackjob @GovMikeHuckabee. That's how you know idea is farfetched.
2018..bye bye
GERRYMANDERING
I am a constituent in   85284. I do not want the 9th circuit broken up. Leave it alone
Do we get to vote on it? Your bill?
Let me be clear I will vote no
this is your last term
technically she paid someone else taxes but yea what a waste of time to deport her.shes harmless
true.
Again, you are out of touch with your constituents. Leave the 9th circuit alone.
You people sicken me - Republicans are already eroding the 1ST and 4TH Amendments and now you attack judges.
Trying to make nice with Trump? I am sure voters will remember in 2018. #Fulcrum #ResistTrump
Impeach the Administration.
You are not for small government. You want to ban people? You are a disappointing Senator. #flakeout2018
really??? Just because they ruled against orange man??? Pathetic!!
You are a fake Senator on the most illegitimate news network. Both of you lie as much as trump. #flakeout2018
We are watching you and you can kiss your job goodbye! We will fight hard to dethrone you. And you are a  for posting Hucka
@GovMikeHuckabeYup just as I thought another trump stooge.
you will he defeated in 2018...Enjoy your time in Congress while you can#
he's a senator 
@SenJohnMcCain The inventors of FAUX NEWS endorsing your bill isn't something to brag about. #9thCircuit
when are you having a town hall. #facethevoters
of course from FOX... pleeese!!!! SAD
I was going to vote for you as a moderate. Attempting to infringe on the judiciary? You've lost my vote.
da fuq is wrong with you two. Please tell us maybe it can be fixed.
yikes, time for a replacement for a lot in AZ
and...we have McCain too! Time to retire! Use to have piss and vinegar
#2018 newsenatorforAZ...
you have to be the most self-congratulatory person. Is it because no one else thinks you are doing a good job?
constituent in 85383. Huckabee?  Oh, puleezze! Leave the 9th Circuit as is.  How about a town hall or answer us
overuse of the word great. Cmon man!
I'm a 65 yr old woman, supported the Viet Nam War, didn't think Nixon that bad. But you have my attention.
Wow! Must be proud to have the endorsement of someone who doesn't understand the separation of church & state!
Wow I'm impressed No Flake in 18 is all I can say
you have lost my vote.
See... I even changed my party after 45 years! People have to stand up and work on new!
it would appear by the response, your views are not shared by those who voted for you. You should listen more.
Why would you do something so egregious at this time?
if CA succeeds - I'm taking my tax paying ass over there!
don't have to... just vote, get others to! Run for office . We have to work!
Gerrymandering the Courts are just another way to keep from draining the swamp.
Any comment on the President lying to the Senate about voter fraud today?
fox news?  You're proud of that?!?  Flake part of the Trump news network.
As One of your constituents I would like to know when you plan on having a town hall meeting as well?
.@JeffFlake @GovMikeHuckabee is the genius who mocked Schumer's emotionality about ancestors killed in the Holocaust. Nice company you keep
Because we need less checks and balances you shit-gibbon.
you mean the transphobic ahole? 2018 AZ is voting you out. @GOP = No spine.
glad you are more concerned about what he says rather than your own constituents. #outin2018
Tracey!!!!  So what we all going to do... vote for someone else!  Krysten Sinema listens and works
I'd support Krysten @RepSinema for senate '18. Instead of dividing 9th Circuit #ValentinesforVets dump @JeffFlake
Madura!!! Hey girl! I am with u on that! She is awesome!!!!
Don't try to mess with an equal branch of gov.  Huckabee is a clown and a loser.
Huckabee and @cathiherrod don't seem like the endorsement a "moderate" wants.  You have gone hard right.
Why not break up the Republican court down in Texas.  Both sides play same game.
When Huckabee is on your side, you need to take a hard look at yourself. 634 days until the 2018 election, senator. Listen to us.
Damage done! Good bye
maybe learn why we have 3 branches. We don't get to destroy all things that don't agree with us in this country.
When is your townhall??? Time to tak to voters not just donors.
Courts wouldn't be overworked if AZ would stop pushing stupid laws that always end up in court. Burning through taxpayer $$$$
this is a bad idea.
you are going to scrape the bottom, aren't you?
Why, and with Huckabee.  You need new friends, badly.  Keep as is, it ain't broke, fix something that is!!!!
blah blah blah snowflake blah blah blah can't accept reality blah blah blah you lost blah blah blah blah blah.
What an amazing outer child you have!... And so proud of it too I see....
#ListenToYourConstituents
Simple- nothing more needed.
Hope others retweet as well.
Huckabee is a clown endorsement
bad move Jeff- you suck
#lListenToYourConstituents not a TV personality. The courts are fine. They wouldnt be overworked had you voted for 44's choice
The court denies it is overworked.
BOOOOO
when will you break up FOX spreading fake news all day/every day?
disgusting political ploy. Town hall now! You and McSally are cowards
If you can't have your way, wreck it for everyone. Self centered Republican ideologically. Az is done w u. 2018
Flakeout2018!
Flake not as delusional as faux evangelical Huckabee, who believes he gets messages from god 
flake 18 is coming and hopefully u will be gone from the senate eagerly awaiting
When can we expect a town hall meeting to discuss how great you are doing?
Like always, forgetting who you represent. No vote for you in 2018!
Leave the 9th Circuit alone. You can't go around breaking things when you don't get your way! We're watching!
Of course you would get an endorsement from the right wing propaganda machine. Prepare to lose in 2018!
also, you never got back to me on how much it costs to buy you.  If you're going to be a puppet, might as well be OUR puppet.
not sure on Flake, but DeVoss gave McCain $50,300... cheap date
of course Fox News, because they always tell the truth
can't wait to vote you out!  With love from AZ!
Huckabee is not relevant to any 9th Circuit issue.
btw we aren't going anywhere we are strong, we are angry, we vote, we will outlast you. #2018
WHO WANTS THIS?  YOU.  Your constituents want you to DO YOUR JOB!  You answer to us, sunshine.  Have you forgotten that?
You will likely see no such endorsement from your constituency
there is no need to break up the #9thCircuitcourt
I would think that would be a red flag
interesting devide don't like your checks and balances don't be elected officials. #shameful #devos #2018
So you are attempting to gerrymander to your own benefit.
I would not be bragging about that.
you're bragging about an endorsement from a man who compared gays to pedophiles?
Ain't too bright, are ya?
Great endorsement from one the worst news sources around.
bahahahahhaha! U and Huckabee two nutty evangelicals! #FIRSTCHURCH
Sen Flake, I am a constituent in 85345 who does NOT want to see the 9th Circuit broken up. Leave it alone.
But Flake, you will go along with the party lines as usual.  Stop flexing..no one believes you.
yeah, cause he's a winner. 
Huckabee is a damn clown
what the hell
Impeach the 9th Circuit, they have been a rogue court for decades
