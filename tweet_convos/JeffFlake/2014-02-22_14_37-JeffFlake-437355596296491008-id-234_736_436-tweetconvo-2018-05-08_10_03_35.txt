@JeffFlake I hope people of faith won't be persecuted by the state for following their conscience.
.@sav01 your right to faith is should not be greater then someone's civil rights.
@brooklynmike21 @sav01 Where in the world do you think the foundation for those rights came from? Darwin?
.@LibertyImages our rights in this country come from the Constitution not the Bible. #SB1062
@brooklynmike21 Indeed, and many of the ideas in the former were based upon the latter. Moreover, ppl of faith marched for civil rights.
.@LibertyImages still doesn't give someone the right not to serve someone b/c it doesn't line up with your religious views. #SB1062
@brooklynmike21 I see. There's no such thing as freedom of association, then. Should I be forced to "serve" a Nazi, too? A KKK dragon?
.@LibertyImages are you comparing gays to Nazis and the KKK!?! I can now see why this country is supporting gay rights more. #SB1062
@JeffFlake @joshtpm @sav01 Ah, let the right wing freak out ensue.
@Superfalcon01 No one is freaking out here, except perhaps you. @JeffFlake @joshtpm
@sav01 so should a person be denied a job or fired from his job because he's gay, black or Muslim? @JeffFlake @joshtpm
@Superfalcon01 Read the law. @JeffFlake @joshtpm
@JeffFlake @sav01 If this bill is made law, anyone can refuse service to anyone for any reason and simply say it is because of religion. BAD
@slater619 Read the law. @JeffFlake
@sav01 @JeffFlake GOP US Senator, the AZ chamber of commerce, secretary of state AND two GOP candidates for governor all say no, it's BAD
@slater619 As though all politicians are right or care about religious liberty.  @JeffFlake
@JeffFlake @sav01 and no group should be unjustly discriminated against. LGBTQ is legal, discrimination isn't.
@TRSmaller  Unless it's against people of faith, but that is lost on you I'm sure. @JeffFlake
@sav01 @JeffFlake Thank you very much, I AM a person of faith... apparently not yours... thanks for the hate, I'm sure we all appreciate it.
Shorter: You want Christians threatened w/jail 4not going against their religious convictions 2support gay marriage @JeffFlake #dulynoted
@JeffFlake Ash Wednesday you praise the pro-abortion (and likely Catholic) Ed Pastor? Pope John Paul 2 is spinning in his Roman grave.
@JeffFlake @conservtivemom Me To!
@JeffFlake McCain's progressive poodle has spoken! No go back to DC where crooks like you are at home.
@JeffFlake @APChristie 
I will stand by what is right and holy.  Homosexual unions and actions are not.
@JeffFlake @APChristie 
Furthermore, there is what is called religious freedom in this country.
@JeffFlake @APChristie 
I hope it goes through.  I am tired of the hateful acts by this homosexual movement.
@Rep_DanGordon @JeffFlake I agree!
@JeffFlake @APChristie Why single out the gays who oppose it when so many others do too?  Any business owner in the state should be worried.
@JeffFlake @APChristie Bob's headline "Pressure mounts over bill opposed by gay" Chamber of Commerce, corporations, senators oppose too
@JeffFlake good for you senator Flake. Thanks
@JeffFlake yet you backed the founder of CAP for governor who is the lobby behind SB1062  pretty hypocritical
@JeffFlake You have become as much of an embarrassment to Arizona as John McCain did ages ago. Doesn't take long in Washington, does it?
@JeffFlake so do most Americans, time for this stuff to end
.@JeffFlake A Live-and-Let-Live Law http://tomohalloran.com/2014/02/24/live-let-live-law/ … Read how a veto will damage businesses in AZ #tcot #tlot
@JeffFlake  No One has the right to force you to do anything..because its your bussniess if you wish to take the loss in money upto you
@purple_mm @JeffFlake @StephenTapia2  Wow, what a wimp. 1062  And to think I voted for him because I thought he was conservative.
@z7greens @purple_mm @JeffFlake Do me a favor and block me back.
@JeffFlake Why veto 1062?   Have you been bullied by "economic impact"?
@JeffFlake Seriously, can't wait 2 c Christian Cons go batshit crazy when Hindu won't serve them b/c of their religion. @torqueflite
Amen. “@JeffFlake: I hope Governor Brewer vetoes SB 1062”
So, you believe Christian business owners should have no rights? You are useless!  RT @JeffFlake I hope Governor Brewer vetoes SB 1062
@JeffFlake thanks for your support! #VetoSB1062 @GovBrewer
@JeffFlake @sav01 Trying to remember H.S. civics... Everyone has a right to their faith, no one has a right to impose their faith on another
“@JeffFlake: I hope Governor Brewer vetoes SB 1062”. I don't agree with, quote or let alone retweet Jeff Flake, but he makes sense tonight.
@JeffFlake I wish you would just GO AWAY!!!  McCain clone...
@JeffFlake @JoaquinCastrotx thank you, @jeffFlake!
@JeffFlake Should a black owned bakery be required to provide a cake for a Ku Klux Klan wedding?
@JeffFlake 
I hope not!
Wow :) Two Republican senators @JeffFlake & @SenJohnMcCain tweeted "I hope Governor Brewer vetoes #SB1062" for legalizing discriminations
@JeffFlake I hope you actually read the bill. All it does is protect religious freedom. You know, the thing you actually swore to protect?
@JeffFlake I hope you don't get re-elected. I'm sorry I voted for you. Shame on you for turning your back on our 1st freedom. #1stAmendment
“@JeffFlake: I hope Governor Brewer vetoes SB 1062”
@teambrewer
@JeffFlake why did you vote for it if you want it vetoed?
@JeffFlake Thank you, Senator.  Laws that create second-class citizenship are unamerican.  Period.
“@JeffFlake: I hope Governor Brewer vetoes SB 1062” Me too.
@JeffFlake I don't always agree with you, so it's worth commending you for taking a tough stand on the right side of this rights issue.
.@JeffFlake You're just covering your ass, and America knows it. #UniteBlue #STFUYouFraud
@JeffFlake You R a #RINO #traitor: what abt #religiousliberty?!? Will remember next #election! #sodomy #Bible #God #Christianity #gay #tcot
Both US Sen from AZ agree MT “@SenJohnMcCain & @JeffFlake: I hope Governor Brewer vetoes SB 1062” #VetoGayJimCrowLaw
@JeffFlake right?!?  You drafted it!  You couldn't get off your #homophobic ass and stop it from ever seeing the light of day?! #outoftouch
Also, wow. RT @JeffFlake: I hope Governor Brewer vetoes SB 1062
“@JeffFlake: I hope Governor Brewer vetoes SB 1062” This is time to say no to discrimination.
@donnabrazile @JeffFlake Do so personally, not with the jack-boot of government.
Props for taking the right stand! RT "@JeffFlake: I hope Governor Brewer vetoes SB 1062”
.@JeffFlake If you were in the #AZLegislature you'd have voted for this bill nine times. Nice posturing, though.
@JeffFlake Why so, Senator? We here in Republican, pro-trad-marriage, pro-religious freedom AZ are behind this bill - hadn't you heard?
RT @JeffFlake: I hope Governor Brewer vetoes SB 1062
Flake joins McCain in tweeting oppostion to "religious discrimination" bill in #AZ “@JeffFlake: I hope Governor Brewer vetoes SB 1062”
RT @JeffFlake: I hope Governor Brewer vetoes SB 1062
@JeffFlake @HuffPostPol @maddow Forget hope. Pick up the phone and make it happen. Unlike us, you're in a position to actually do something.
@JeffFlake I hope you found a heart, bit of compassion, become human and vote YES to #RenewUI Dont be a Flake, SAVE lives for Pete Sake!
@JeffFlake me too
@JeffFlake @jaketapper I hope you aren't holding your breath :(
@JeffFlake @haymakers WTF IS WRONG WITH YOUR LOUSY STATE ?
@JeffFlake @jaketapper I hope not - 1st Amendment protection is necessary.
.@JeffFlake I'm sure this is true, given your history as a supporter of equal rights and non-discrimination.
Respect. RT @JeffFlake: I hope Governor Brewer vetoes SB 1062
Slightly surprised but happy to see prominent AZ Republicans speaking out #ItsADryHate MT @JeffFlake I hope Governor Brewer vetoes #SB1062
@PTrentOlsen Bad memories from SB1070, except this isn't a red-hot issue pushing politicians inexorably down an ill-advised path.
@mcslaven I suppose in the proponents' echo chamber it's a red hot issue. Otherwise, what would be driving similar policies in other states?
@PTrentOlsen I think there's an advocacy-coalition explanation for appearing in multiple states. Doesn't capture the broader imagination.
@JeffFlake: thank you for standing up for what's right! I used to go to AZ for Spring Training. Haven't spent a dime in AZ since SB1070
@JeffFlake @say01 When you're persecuted, your rights are taken away. Discriminating against others is NOT a right.
@JeffFlake hate is against my religion
@JeffFlake love thy neighbor as thy self
@JeffFlake only god has the right to judge it's very clearly state by the savior himself yet seems no religions are listening to him
@JeffFlake Sheryl if you truly had a conscience you would love everyone and let god be the judge it's not your job to judge
@JeffFlake 2 many of Lester Maddox's descendants retired to AZ! I & my friends happy to boycott AZ 'til brain-dead GOP no longer in control.
“@JeffFlake: I hope Governor Brewer vetoes SB 1062” #SB1062 doesn't make sense even to Flake. Veto it.
.@JeffFlake I hope you are not reelected. Please stand up for religious liberty.
@jasonsmathers @JeffFlake awesome Jeff!!  agree with you
@JeffFlake Thanks for being a rational voice by opposing #SB1062.  If Brewer signs it, I nix my reservations for our AZ family vacation.
@JeffFlake the fact she’s even “thinking” about says volumes..
@JeffFlake Thanks, Senator!
@JeffFlake Thanks Senator Flake for taking the time to come out for civility & common sense government.
“@JeffFlake: I hope Governor Brewer vetoes SB 1062” I hope @GovBrewer listens #AZ #discrimination #Equality
.@JeffFlake I hope she vetoes it, too. I love Arizona n hope to spend time there again.
Whoa. Didn't see that coming=> “@JeffFlake: I hope Governor Brewer vetoes SB 1062” #SB1062
@JeffFlake THANK YOU!!!!
@JeffFlake one more generation and the bible will be irrelevant. Thank God
@JeffFlake Senator Flake you have done the right thing unlike many other Arizona Republicans.
.@JeffFlake @MeghanMcCain she won't. There's a "Scolding Obama At The Airport" rider attached.
@JeffFlake @yvonnewingett not with her track record. Do more than hope. Will she stop appointing only republican judges? Gov of Republicans.
RT @JeffFlake I hope Governor Brewer vetoes SB 1062
@JeffFlake I hope Jeff Flake remembers that we remember the cowardice you showed after the Newtown slaughter.
Sense from Arizona Republican US Senator Jeff Flake. RT @JeffFlake I hope Governor Brewer vetoes SB 1062
@JeffFlake Thank you for encouraging @GovBrewer to veto #SB1062.
@JeffFlake Thank you so for being a huge supporter of gay rights! I'm sure we can count on you to legalize gay marriage....oh wait. You suck
@JeffFlake 
Jeff, are you really going to go against what the Bible teaches and risk the wrath of GOD!!!!! Read you're Bible and understand.
Thank you Sen. Flake, we agree RT"@JeffFlake: I hope Governor Brewer vetoes SB 1062”
@JeffFlake @AzEagletarian if you were sincere wouldn't you have used @GovBrewer instead of her name???
@JeffFlake Good take Senator. The state of the current GOP makes this otherwise normal common sense response, more courageous.
@JeffFlake thank you for your leadership.  This Bill limits freedom not expands it, and will lead to a glut of lawsuits.
@JeffFlake Thank You!  We need more of you to call on Gov to Veto this Anti-Gay Bill. #shameonAZlegislators
@JeffFlake @jbendery I thought AZ was 'hot climate' due to being in desert area, not for 'hellish attitude' towards fellow Americans...WWJD?
@JeffFlake @Schnitzerella I think @GovBrewer will veto. She's experienced.
@JeffFlake Why do people spend so much energy with fear and hatred? Lets hope Brewer has the sense to Vito.#gayheretostay!p
@JeffFlake @jbendery It's criminal that #GOP keeps passing legislation that isn't legal, wasting taxpayer money running up big legal bills.
“@JeffFlake: I hope Governor Brewer vetoes SB 1062” Wow.
@JeffFlake the fact that she has to 'think' about this for even a second is disgusting to american values of equality for ALL ppl @jbendery
@JeffFlake Me too.Thanks for your sanity. That's too rare these days.
@JeffFlake Brewer has to realize how bad that bill makes Arizona look, and that it's unconstitutional.  I doubt she signs it.
@JeffFlake While I disagree with you politically on nearly every issue, I applaud your "hope" that Gov Brewer veto SB1062. Now...demand it!
@JeffFlake please urge @GovBrewer to veto SB1062 by RT since you do not support this law #bad4azbiz
@JeffFlake Starting to really regret voting for you. :-/ Have you even read the bill? Or are you just playing politics? #SMH
@JeffFlake me too
@JeffFlake Thanks, Senator Flake.
@JeffFlake So, not so much a libertarian after all.
@JeffFlake thx dude. I don't always agree with you on political matters, but as an AZ voter you've got my respect. (Not just from this, btw)
“@JeffFlake: I hope Governor Brewer vetoes SB 1062” Even this racist is against it!
@JeffFlake Thank you Senator. I'm sending her a letter, too.
@JeffFlake I am a citizen of AZ, CATHOLIC and you have my support. She must VETO SB 1062
Wow. 

“@JeffFlake: I hope Governor Brewer vetoes SB 1062”
@JeffFlake First @waitwait, NPR and now.... THIS ?!?!
@JeffFlake @tootswee Doesn't matter. The fact that it passed is the real problem.
Check your thread @JeffFlake 
U see the kind of ppl U support?

Thank you, Senator RT @JeffFlake: I hope Governor Brewer vetoes SB 1062
@JeffFlake And as a US Senator I trust you will unreservedly condemn the actions of the Arizona legislature in passing this evil bill.
@JeffFlake
I do, too. "@JeffFlake: I hope Governor Brewer vetoes SB 1062”

@JeffFlake OMG, a ray of sanity. This bill is absolutely stupid,ignorant&pathetic. R we becoming Afganistan or Saudi Arabia?

@JeffFlake @Eugene_Scott "Don't just hope @jeffFlake, pick up a phone for goodness sake."

@JeffFlake BullStuff. No way should the gov compel a private citizen to support anything that violates their religious beliefs.
@JeffFlake Wow Jeff thinking looks good. Now keep it up when you get back to congress.
@JeffFlake Nothing like hatred from those who preach tolerance. Now you know why this law is necessary.
