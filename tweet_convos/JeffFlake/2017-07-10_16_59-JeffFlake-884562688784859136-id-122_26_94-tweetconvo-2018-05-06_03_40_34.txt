President under investigation for collusion with foreign govt, conflicts of interest. No nominations until investigation is done.  Traitor!
Of course he is. Mueller's not there to look pretty. Plenty of conflicts and obstruction. Collusion automatically. Follow the rubles.
Mueller is investigating Trump.  The End!
Watched them ages ago.  Things happen - keep up!
Glad you have the courage to stand up for principles instead of money.
Sen Flake, will u b sure 2 ask nom Wray if he will answer questions he did not answer re if Trump Jr meeting?
I miss James Comey already. #ComeyIsMyHomey

HOPEFULLY, FBI will IMPRISON  BIGGEST criminal FOUND IN AMERICA, that TRAITOR trump, #PutinsPuppet , whose TAXES prove he is OWNED BY RUSSIA
I guess if you support him, he must be corrupt.
Good maybe he can start investigating the golden showers dossier-you people up there need to get off your asses and do something about this!

Trump's FBI Director nominee Christopher Wray's law firm represents Russian-controlled oil companies.

anyone who puts USA in jeopardy should be impeached...they should have been impeached also
Glad  you not didn't act like a goofy buffoon at the hearing.  Now,  finished reading that troublesome healthcare bill yet? Remember vote NO
Own it: Wray already has your vote because "whatever Trump wants".
Peter, many democratic senators support Wray too.  Flake never supported Trump in the 2016. Trump offered $10mil to defeat Flake in primary.
Flake was worried about the implications of a nominee who had slim to none chances of winning. Once Trump won, Flake has been a yes sir man.
Respectfully disagree, but I'll concede Flake has picked his battles. Trump has actively recruited Flake primary opponents in past 2 weeks.
Mueller will castrate Wray, a traitor plant with ties to Rosneft. You are on the wrong side of history.

It would be nice if you could support our Prez  One reason we Arizona's plan to unseat you Part of the NEOCON SWAMP
He must be crooked,greedy,racist and partison. Ties to Russia a must.Trump shouldn't be nominating anyone for anything, he is under investig
Why should a President under investigation by the FBI be able to nominate a new director? Keep showing AZ voters your true colors. #2018
Wray is in too deep with the Russians. He should be a hard "NO".
That means he is dirty.
What is your opinion on the Trumps committing treason @JeffFlake ? Should FBI enforce laws forbidding collusion with foreign adversaries?
Put country above party.
director SHOULD be independent...from Russia!!!
must be independent!
Get to repealing Obamacare like you promised instead of forcing your Arizonian Citizen's into another 150% premium increase.
Maybe sure you ask him about this
Let me get this straight. You want the FBI to be independent, but you're willing to sell your BCRA vote to the highest bidder? That's rich.
When are you going to stop supporting RussiaTrump efforts to destroy elections and free press, the foundations of our Democracy, Senator?
What do you intend to do about trump?    You will be held responsible for your lack of leadership.
You don't impress so I could care less what you look forward to.
NO, NO, NO to Cruz Amendment.  Please listen to the vast majority of Americans!  Thank you.
Doesn't he also have ties to Russia?  What is the deal with Congress and Russia?  What do they have on you guys?
He has Russian ties...WTH??? #FLAKEOUT2018
Glad you are vetting him and not forming preconceived notions. Also, please don't take away my health care.
What nodnarb said. Please don't take away our family's healthcare. We'll have to shut our business; jobs will be lost.
WE WILL WORK 24 HOURS A DAY to Defeat You.
YOUR A FRAUD
WE the PEOPLE WILL SPEAK in 18
Dear GOD! Please don't embarrass yourself and all of AZ with inane questions about ducks, horses and fishing like previous questionings.
speak in 18
YOU ARE a WASTE: WE THE PEOPLE Wi
Are you out of your mind? New administration is in order. Immediately. Russian presidents don't get to pick FBI directors.
R U Kidding me? His firm has works w.Russians & that is OK BY U? NO! NO on this nominee! Betraying our DEMOCRACY NOT AN OPTION. U COMPLICIT
What did you love! ties to Russia? Stop Russian take over if USA  vote NO 4 once do the right thing @realDonaldTrump
#SupportSanctions #BlockFBI. We are sick and tied of oil and gas deals taking us to war and now treason.  Keep McCabe.  We deserve better!
#BlockFBI This guy has ties to Russia!  #TrumpTreasonTrain
And of course he does.
Nothing like rubber stamping a Trump agenda whatever the cost #countrybeforeparty
You are avoiding the issues Arizona cares about. Very smooth but it won't fly. Connect with your constituents.
Senator,  thru UR website I contacted you twice this year. Mar. 16 June 23. Different issues. Email reply said you'd reply. No responses.
Sen. Flake, the FBI must maintain independent to do his job well w/out compromising their duty to favorism & nepotism...
Taking time out of your busy schedule.  Better hert back to stealing HC from millions so they can die.
Great job TOTALLY STONEWALLING constituents whining about healthcare over 4th of July recess. Nice touch arresting grifters in wheelchairs!
Vote No on GOP healthcare.  Millions of Americans use Obamacare.  Do not repeal Obamacare.  Fix it. Maintain Obamacare. @SenJohnMcCain 
YES!!! Now we're getting to the bottom of things, a discussion of "independence", how's that taste Libtards? Jeff is working the number...
looking at the angles and deciding how best he can support OUR President on every turn, including that pesky "treason" issue! What libs dont
understand that it's $$ bill ya'll first, party 2nd and those rubes that voted for Jeff, a distant 4th! That's politics Libs learn it...
know it live it. Now Jeff, as your Chief Twitter Advisor, I'm inundated with these #Flakeout2018 #FlipFlake and other such lib nonsense...
and the screaming about the #FlakeTucsonTownHall and why other Reps are doing stand in's for you and why you're inexplicably aligning...
Us with Ted Cruz? Doesn't seem to be the most pop play here Jeff, he's hated by everyone and it's really a bad idea to take away health...
insurance from the people that voted for you Jeff, after all, not a lot of billionaires in AZ, cept you Jeff! Seems like this doesn't help..
anyone in AZ at all. While you've got the Director there Jeff, could you have him take a look at this guy, he's probably a terrorist!
Finally out of hiding from your constituents and back in Washington. Healthcare comes before a new FBI Director. Vote NO on Trumpcare.
Poor vetting of Trumps traitor nominees will haunt you when it's Mueller Time  cc: @SenFlakeStaff
NEW!  Ever wonder how Betsy DeVos got her phony-baloney cabinet position?  Here's how!

https://teapainusa.wordpress.com/2017/07/10/spectrum-healths-role-in-the-trump-russia-server-scandal/ …
Oh Please!  Are you going to question him in the same embarrassing way you did Gorsuch?!  Probably so!
Arizona. Flake is being a flake. Cruz plan is awful!  Call.
So you caved to the disgusting @tedcruz plan bcuz you fear Trump. Choose your constituents over party. Would just one Repub have a backbone
You represent a state so there's a lot more pissed off people. Couple hundred thousand in fact.
Good job screwing over constituents by supporting the 14% approval senate bill. Don't worry our time will come to vote you out.
Kudos ... really ?
You haven't said anything about healthcare?
With his ties to Russia, there is an appearance of impropriety. That alone should exclude Wray as FBI director choice. Duly noted...#2018
You ask him if he will protect you and Trump
So what did you do that angered trump?
Please ask serious ?s - not like the ones of Sessions and Gorsurch #SessionsMustResign
Does that mean social hour with your buddies like the Sessions and Gorsurch hearings?
And the rubber stamp Senator from AZ never sees a Trump bill/nominee he doesn't like. Pity. #LiarInChief
That's nice! Why haven't you publicly stated your position in the GOP's new healthcare bill? Do you support it? We'd like to what you think?
No mention of the protesters you had arrested. Again. 

Why won't you talk to us? 

I'm an Arizonan, and i am NOT paid.  But I DO vote!
You passed complicit long ago, and now are firmly in collusion territory... 2018 can't come soon enough.
Unbelievable! This guy is crooked and you know it. You can't be this dumb. What's your gain in all this?
WHY ARE YOU EVEN CONSIDERING A MAN NOMINATED BY A TRAITOR????? You best stop & think, Mr. Flake. Country b4 Party please. #AnAZVoter
All in for Fraud Trump? Wray's firm has RUSSIAN ties! Stop giving US to the MOB & Putin!  #countrybeforeparty #foxguardinghenouse #traitor
Flake, start packing your bags. Hurting the people of Arizona is not going to get you reelected.
Isn't it about time you took a position on healthcare? I'm sure your minions wld be grateful.
Check the latest new,Flake supports the Cruz edit of it. ANd he'll vote for this Trump Traitor nonminee too. Time for Jeffy to GO.#AnAZVOter
Did you ask him your poignant duck question?
No, no, no... he's saving that favorite for the actual confirmation hearing.
You know how much this stinks, don't you? How can you live with yourself? Trump sold our country! You know it! America knows it! Fix this!
How about the importance of an independent Senate?  Trump's loyalty oath make play well in the mafia, but it has no business in a democracy.
"The freedom one?" Nice grasp of health care policy, Senator. I've sat in the Senate gallery when it's your turn to preside...1/x
...and watched you ignore proceedings while you flip through tabloids (!) Perhaps you should use that time to...2/x
...educate yourself about major policy. Time and time again you show yourself to be a lightweight. 3/3

Mercer money 
He won't have to wait 12 hours for 15 min of your time, like @NationalADAPT  He counts, huh?
Please concentrate on importance of ACA for Az: Medicaid+healthcare jobs serving both locals and snowbirds+biomed research.
That a comment like that is even necessary is disappointing.  We need an FBI that is loyal to the people of America.  Enough said!
And Im afraid hell tell all to t
Jeff I dont trust independence I fear greatly he would stall or stop investigations
He has ties to Russia.
Doesn't he have some Russian connections/entanglements?.  Yor good words Senator are meaningless if they r not supported by tough actions
isn't that the dude who hid Christie's cellphone? Trump needs to go, btw!
Great - another rich white guy easily malleable. 

No to Trumpcare and the Cruz amendment!
Be careful, Jeff.  Check out his Russian connections.
@SenJohnMcCain The #GOP has already checked out Wray's Russian connections. That's why he was nominated!@ 
Let me guess you're still undecided yet, right?
You know what is also nice? Having conversations with your constituents. #countrybeforeparty
Who do you represent? It sure the hell isn't the people of Arizona..You will never get my vote again
Senator Flake, you make me sick. You care nothing for the people of Arizona. You  the NRA, Koch bros, and TED CRUZ. So gross! Ugh!!!!!!

Scare of your constituents!
Wait, where were his Russian handlers? Mr Flake you shouldn't be so rude!

Q: Did any Trump campaign member have contact with the Russians?…
When are you going to take a public position on Trumpcare? You were elected to be a leader, not a follower.
He did. He is in favor with Ted Cruz of all flippin people

News breaks on your Cruz amended BCRA stance, and you push this....#shame #2018
Why are you in favor of The Cruz amendment? Drafted in secret, not publicly available, no hearings, no CBO. Who's pocket R U in?
And will make costs for sicker pple zoom while driving up uncompensated care costs. Brilliant.
