So, does this mean you will be endorsing Donald Trump?
If he loves the country, he should, and so should you. Extremists Left & Right, like you, have ruined the USA
What, exactly, makes one an extremist?
For example, I have gay Dem friends voting 4 @realDonaldTrump instead of HRC
Well, you just aligned ourself with political mold. #firePence
Here is push-back for you, as lifelong Republican I will be voting against you for reelection when that time comes #RetireFlake
Country in turmoil and white rhinos are playing games. #NeverGOP
well in that case, it's so sad that you don't seem to have any respect for women. #neverpence
Interesting how he can reveal so much about himself w/1 tweet announcing his admiration 4 Pence. OKAY, now we know.
Flake is human excrement that needs to be purged from the GOP. Looking forward to his defeat in the '2018 primary.
amazing how tough u talk to purge GOP in non-election year. Can't wait 2 purge you-2018! All in for @realDonaldTrump!!
No wonder you respect him! Pence shares the same ideology on the LGBT community as your son!
Don't worry ur pretty little head
"countries" NOT "Muslims"

@JeffFlake #GOP Needs to Purge Those Who Want Muslim Ban
then maybe you should support the ticket!!
He's a fascist fuck head.
That's a pretty low bar then
So why the hell are you speaking up for this lying criminal Hillary? I hope Arizona throws you and McCain out.
I disagree entirely
To bad you're worried about a yard instead of your country #TRUMP
you're losing me there Jeff.  Your last scrap of dignity is fading....  Stay strong AZ Dude.
well since you're raising your sons to be homophobic he's probably a good role model for the 2 little Flakes
you forgot hillary jeffy
You and ALL the Republicans need to BACK TRUMP to get our Country back on track and improve Americans way of life!
Lost this Republican w/ Bush, now you have Trump. AZ Rep who does not repudiate Him loses this Indie's vote. RParty is shrinking
.@JeffFlake .@mike_pence Sounds like you don't know the guy at all
With archaic and sexist views.
yet you take the Lyin Ted approach and rebuke the RNC nominee ? Cant wait til we can make Arizona great again and get rid of you.
Would you have called for more NAZI's or Japanese during WW2? Probably, you are being a Traitor & Enemy Agent. Get a Clue Flake
.@JeffFlake 
Anyone who doesn't want a 
Total #MuslimBan should be kicked out of GOP, you are a Traitor to the USA, if you want Our Enemy's
NYTimes article, "Jeff Flake believes the GOP must purge the presumptive nominee’s supporters after the election"
You're a RINO and would make a fine asset to the Democrat party.
he adds to the ticket but you won't go to the convention? Can't wait to vote you out! #flakeisarino
hmmm and he now supports temporary ban on muslims...you want to purge him too or just BS on your part?
Disappointed to hear you say it. Thought you'd be mowing your lawn? http://www.npr.org/2016/07/18/486398726/dumpster-fires-fishing-and-travel-these-republicans-are-sitting-out-the-rnc …
Garbage like Flake would have the US a Sharia compliant third world hole. Islam is not an enemy, somehow Russia is?
you called me a racist for being a Trump supporter I am also an avid In. Proud @GovPenceIN supporter, still a racist?
@Erasmo78856372 @mike_pence
U Flake MUST2B purged from GOP! @realDonaldTrump voted by us GOP grassroots voters! WE R d GOP Party! WE WANT TRUMP!
A few more years and you're gone flake.
Care to explain the purging of Trump Supporters ? Or are u just another 2 faced establishment ? #Arizona
@realDonaldTrump http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/17/us/politics/donald-trump-republican-convention.html?_r=0 …
I was expecting you to say @BarackObama.
did you say that most of  @realDonaldTrump supporters are motivated by racism? You are misguided my friend.
Yes he does and he and Trump are going to win
So grow up and support the ticket. The voters have chosen their nominee!
@ The people chose Trump  so Jeff just back to Arizona and take the loser Romney with you.
You want Trump supporters purged? Why would you want any kind of purge?
then show up jackass to the convention quit being a big cry baby you must love Hillary
Good to see you getting behind the TICKET! I would hate to vote you OUT!
hey Jeff just got home from church and you dare not support @realDonaldTrump with this lawlessness? #FireJeff
Jeff, you don't really mow your lawn, you hire an illegal to do it. Tell the truth.
So R U gonna get off ur high horse & get behind Trump, now that u like VP? I for 1 am tired of ur blather.
So disappointed you think Pence is a "good man," thot you were going to be someone from AZ I could finally support.
@seungminkim @mike_pence Pathetic Pence
#FireJeff. He has to mow the lawn instead of support the R nominee to beat Hillary and take this country back
Seriously, Jeff? Pence is trump with better hair.  Can't wait to vote you out at the end of your term.
Please don't use him as a reason to support @realDonaldTrump
He's great if you support discrimination against gays and dodging direct questions. At least he complements Trump.
a science denier, misogynist, idiot that put his own state's economy at risk? Sure!
@res0xhdb2 @mike_pence lmao. No one believes you
I had been impressed by your taste in opposing @realDonaldTrump. How smart can @mike_pence be if he is willing to serve with him?
Well at least Indiana is solvent.
you looking for an excuse to support TRUMP
no one? Really?
@seungminkim @mike_pence the kind that can't decide whether he wants to discriminate against LGBT people or not. Lame pick.
started drinking the Kool-Aid already, Jeff? don't forget the racist atop the ticket
@hunterschwarz @mike_pence And a dedicated homophobe.
worse, an indecisive flaky homophobe
Adds a great deal to an already racist, homophobic, bigoted ticket???  Nice job GOP!
r u replying to a tweet from 2 days ago?  And saying the republicans aren't racists?  #deleteyouraccount
The word "racist" no longer works in a world where a Muslim immigrant can murder 84 PPL with a truck. Dope.
Mike Pence endorsed Trump.  Mike Pence is a true conservative.
This coming from you verifies that this was a huge mistake. Bye again for anohter term republicans #PalinRuinedItToo
Speaking as a gay middle-aged male who values his hard-won right to equality too much to see it trashed, I'll pass.
Congrats on having the whitest teeth I've ever seen in an avatar!!
I was willing 2 listen to what Pence had 2 say, knowing you like him Flake made me not want 2 vote 4 him, thank u
At least Indiana is solvent. Pence isn't flashy, but honest, hard working & caring.
Yes, a great deal of bigotry, and intolerance towards anyone who isn't a straight white Evangelical Christian male.
Good. Now let's unite and defeat HRC!
stop smoking so much crack, Jen
Sorry Jeff he is not running for President we are still stuck with Trump. All you guys are doing is making it worse.
oh...so another do-nothing rino like you!

Don't support this traitor
