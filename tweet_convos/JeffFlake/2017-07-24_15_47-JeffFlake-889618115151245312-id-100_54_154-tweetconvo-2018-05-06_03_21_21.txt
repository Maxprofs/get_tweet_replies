We agree with you on #NAFTA4AZ!  We do not agree on healthcare.  Please vote no on the MTP for a mystery bill.  It's wrong.
What is the benefit of nafta to this country ?
You keep YOUR insurance that we pay for but throw the poor and middle class of theirs Your Dem opponents in 2018 will win on this issue
How much subsidy do you get, I am tired of paying your subsidy.

Sure, because apparently NOONE ELSE MATTERS. Really?
NAFTA? You're no American.
Lol good luck. Nafta going down like ACA.
Not even trump is saying he wants to get rid of it.  Sorry
NAFTA was the worst deal ever!
Are you going to try to golly gee us into forgetting you voted for TrumPCare?
Those are slogans ,it's having a favorable affect on your healthcare, crime, schools
From Mexico....
#NAFTA destroyed so many jobs. You're a disgrace to conservatives, time for you to join the #DNC
Bullshit, NAFTA has been a killer and has destroyed jobs in the USA along with salaries.  Stop lying and build the damn wall. Reject NAFTA.

Only if it is done the way it needs to be done. Work with the president on this.
NAFTA is a "giveaway" of jobs in the USA. It in NO way helps the U S A's economic growth, nor does it support American jobs or opportunity.

I don't buy vegetables or fruits from Mexico.  Do you know what they use for fertilizer?
This guy does NOT support Arizonans if he doesn't support the president.  They voted for him after all.
You have no idea what you are talking about

Enjoy #FlakeCare. It's your baby now. #OwnIt

Get on board with our President, Mr Flake....that's why we sent you to D.C.
No this is a Senator who gets it:
We work for you. Keep demanding answers on health care from your representatives.
How much subsidy do you get, I am tired of paying your subsidy.
Vote no on Trumpcare. 23 million lose access to affordable coverage. Decimates Medicaid.
How much subsidy do you get, I am tired of paying your subsidy.
Please vote NO on healthcare repeal this week! I am a constituent and am pleading with you to do the right thing! Our lives depend on it!
How much subsidy do you get, I am tired of paying your subsidy.
You wouldn't know a good deal if it kicked you in the face. #2018

#NeverFlake @JeffFlake we are going to run a campaign head and shoulders above any #rinos to #MAGA 
NO NAFTA NO NAFTA NO NAFTA NO NAFTA! Traitor!
VOTE NO ON HORRENDOUS SO-CALLED HEALTHCARE IF IT GETS TO THE SENATE!! IT'S AN AFFRONT TO ARIZONANS AND HUMANITY EVERYWHERE!
Cousin Jeff, you will not look good in the history books if you continue to support the #mentallyillPOTUS.  Why doesn't this frighten you?
Snowflake? Well how ironic is that!?
how does chaining people to their jobs for healthcare support economic growth? Fix ACA and move on...
cc: @SenJohnMcCain
hope you will pray to Jesus for answer re what Jesus would say about kicking poor off healthcare in order to give tax cuts to millionaires
At least on this issue, kudos for sticking to your principles.
Health care

Canada-Arizona trade in 65 seconds! Trade with #Canada supports over 146,000 jobs in #Arizona #NAFTA #FriendsPartnersAllies 
But what about whatever is being put on the table tomorrow?  You can help in stopping this insanity by voting NO to any consideration.
Please vote no on Trumpcare.
Please vote no on the repeal of ACA. You're smarter than the party line; your commitment to NAFTA shows that.
SO DOES HEALTHCARE #ACA #Medicaid
You were my Rep and now my Sen. I know you're getting a lot of heat but this independent supports you. Please vote no on killing Medicare
VOTE THE COWARD FLAKE OUT!!!
#MAGA2020
Yes and DJT wants to end it.. and ACA  vote against it tomorrow
Stop avoiding and dissembling. Support your state and vote no on the repeal.
What difference does that make if you take away health care from millions and collapse the economy? #Trumpcare is TERRIBLE for AZ! #VoteNO
Trump is mentally ill. Help us
So does the #ACA
Our #latinamerica neighbors in Sonora & elsewhere boost our economy far beyond any detriment their legal status might cause. #NAFTA
I hear you are voting for that horrid health bill so millions of Americans can loose their insurance. you really care about us
NO to NAFTA
NAFTA allows for corporations to use offshore labor without any penalty whatsoever. Free trade is not fair trade;.
Vote no on Repeal of ACA. Work bi-partisan and fix what needs to be improved.
Become a loyal republican!
Can you please tell @BernieSanders and @realDonaldTrump.
Mr Flake, at this rate I might consider voting for you next time. Just do the right thing and vote no on this awful Trumpcare bill.

How will you explain to someone in Phoenix that they will play 4x, 50% more, or 2x what hey pay under ACA @JeffFlake & @SenJohnMcCain?

.@ChrisMurphyCT explains how Obamacare isn't dying — Trump is purposefully killing it 
Amen 
Please vote NO on tomorrow's vote to strip millions of Americans of their health care. I'm in Tucson, as my Senator I need you to protect me
The Democrats Own this Bad Bill 100% Dems Voted for it in 2009 ZERO Dems have offered Any Change 100% of Dems are Silent.good bye Dems & ACA
You are so kind it's heartwarming!
Time to stand up for Arizona and tell trump to shut his trap. He is hurting our economy and trade with Mexico. Speak the truth.
As does a robust health care system.  Have you seen the job loss #s if #BCRA goes through?  #ProtectOurCare #FixACA #NoOnMTP
WHY people trust you & McCain is beyond me. Both lie & r consumed with personal self-gain. NOT the people of Arizona.
No on #Trumpcare
You have no clue what America needs.
You do not support @realDonaldTrump 
Honestly, resign, and spare us your useless presence.
#VoteNo
Tell Trump
Trump pissed off Mexico, food cost has gone up.  Now they are looking to buy corn from South America. That will hurt the corn belt farmers.
Your mailboxes are full. This is unacceptable, unless you don't want to hear from your constituents
Dead people don't care about NAFTA. You're willing to put 20% of our economy at risk through a nonchalant vote on heathcare. Vote no on MTP.

https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2017-07-20/senate-s-revised-health-bill-would-boost-uninsured-by-22-million … 

This health care bill isn't simply unconscionable and unjust. It's unconstitutional.

We won't stand for it. 

No MTP on trumpcare.... Helping AZ and the rest of the country... What a concept!
#VoteNo
#VoteNo
You LIAR! I am changing my party affiliation from IND to REP, just to vote NO on you. You are  McCain CLONE.
Look at you and your profile it's like you're brainwashed.

Joe Manchin's message to GOP senators: "Let’s get together" on health care
https://bloom.bg/2tbPSaW  

We believe government should work for you & for the millions of hard working Americans who just need #ABetterDeal. Here's our plan: 

We are ready to improve the healthcare system at any time. But we are not willing to throw tens of millions off their care to fund tax cuts. 
Vote no on Trumpcare

Eight years ago today, right now: Obama was wrapping another town hall where he took questions on his health plan. 

Schumer doubles down on his earlier calls for a bipartisan health care plan
