Thank you for taking some action on this. While you're at it, introduce legislation to study gun violence for solutions.
So what was wrong with the identical pieces of legislation that you rejected yesterday?
He wants credit. Also he and McCain want to flood the courts and have a judge decide if the gun can be purchased @legaleagle48 @JeffFlake
instead I guess you want anything u don't like changed in the constitution?Forget the laws and rights
Ohhhhh yeaaaaaa that's exaaaactly what I want *eye roll* @WbMcrae @legaleagle48 @JeffFlake
hum well what do you think they are voting for?To put Citizens on a list .Take away rights, no appeal
Try reading up on your history of gun culture, NRA and how they changed laws in their favor #RollBack @WbMcrae @legaleagle48 @JeffFlake
the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.So the nra help the write constu
Are you really truly under the impression that no laws have been passed since the Constitution? Geesh @WbMcrae
You should be in prison.
Shame on you for supporting Ayotte amendment #NoFlyNoBuy, issue is Jihad not restricting our gun rights. #USTERMLIMITS NOW!
#Arizona is ashamed of you. You do not represent us. 2018 is coming #Jeffy. #2A #BillofRights #DueProcess
#DoYourJob #NoBillNoBreak
Learn what due process is, Senator Flake.
where are you today!? @HouseDemocrats need your BIPARTISAN support now!!!! #NoBillNoBreak
#NoBillNoBreak #gunsafetymatters #supportgunsafetylegislation I demand gun violence be stopped!
could you please name a bipartisan effort that the dems came over to your view?
Throws righty but hit lefty
taking guns with no due process.  Why are you so anti 2nd amendment?
The Demos plan to deny 2nd Amendment Rights to those who criticize OUR gov't, or issue anti-Muslim or anti-LGBT comments! BEWARE!
.@JeffFlake Thank you for supporting Collins amendment. #NoFlyNoBuy is common sense, and shouldn't be a partisan issue.
GOP's shameful evasion of duty to debate and address gun issues inexcusable.  If your not full of s*%t, join the sit in...
Thank you so much for your efforts! #NoFlyNoBuy Thank YOU for listening to the people you represent.
thank you for taking an important FIRST step#noflynobuy
talk is cheap. When will you bring #NoFlyNoBuy to a vote?? #BeSensible
Just WHAT do u stand for AZ @JeffFlake ?! U swore to defend Constitution & protect God Given Rights. Instead u violate Due Process & #2A
thank you for taking a stand. Lives vs politics.  I always choose life!
Total BS. A radical islamic terrorist attacked ppl in Orlando. Do we fight ISIS? NOOOO. Let's blame guns!! #RINO #GOPe
#NoBillNoBreak I strongly support these bills.  Please, add your voice to bring this debate forward by the House.
I heard you on NPR, you said this was a compromise that the NRA would be ok with, is that who decides on our laws?
Government can put anyone on No Fly List and take away a persons rights with no due process. Both you and McCain are out soon.
Thank you for the courage to put country ahead of politics.   U wl b criticized by some but many agree!
happy U support bill-BUT have guts to say NO one needs assault riffle- couldn't answer CNN who needs it- stand up to NRA
Anyone too dangerous to put on a plane should already be dead. Fuck your "bipartisan" bill. And quit asking me for money!
obama wants blame guns TERRORIST USE BOMBS PLANES KNIVES.
Have you thought about how easy it will be to get on the no fly list if your bill passes?
uh ehm you sir were playing politics.
please reconsider your support of #NoFlyNoBuy. Very slippery slope. Look at IRS abuse. Criminals find a way no matter the law.
Wanna be prez some day? Go to the House right now and stand with John Lewis. You're on wrong team & you know it. #NoBillNoBreak
I don't know the details yet but happy to see bipartisan effort...legis that is all-Dem or all-GOP won't ever pass...am hopeful
you previously voted against restricting gun rights to suspected terrorists. I'm glad for the change of heart #DisarmHate
So you support restricting a citizens rights because they were put on a list? What happened to due process? #lostmyvote
He won't even protect his own state from the thousands of drug cartels entering Arizona each week!  He's a traitor
What is due process for adding/removing someone from the No Fly List? That is important if you intend to deny rights. #NoFlyNoBuy
#FAIL #AmericanVoters #commonsense #guncontrol
You may as well be a Democrat since you're  .... "with her". Pathetic loser !
you da Man! Thanks for your hard work & courage to work the tough issues. Pls don't change like McCain. You have my vote 
thank you senator flake when dealing with Muslims remember Nauvoo
spanked by @Judgenap on @KennedyNation for selling out our liberties to get re-elected.  Ouch!
@alllibertynews @JeffFlake @Judgenap @KennedyNation Flake out ya mean! Poster child for cowardice & needs to be fired by AZ
Playing politics is exactly what you're doing. You decided selling out due process + the Constitution for personal gain was OK.
you need to be voted out of office.
Go look up the definition of #DueProcess you #Dope. 2018 is coming Jeff and #Arizona voters have a good memory.
coward. Bit by bit chipping away our rights.
Im an Arizona voter and gun owner. Do not submit a gun bill that will infringe on citizens rights. I'll support a recall if u do
There goes #JeffTheFlake being a flake..  again
I heard you on NPR. Your first reason for supporting this bill was that it satisfied the NRA. What about your constituents?
This constituent is satisfied with Flakes position!
how much $ have you received from the NRA?
You do know that our former state treasurer was on the no fly list.
Seriously?? and this idiot @JeffFlake STILL wants to do it?
you've lost my vote
"Bipartisan" you say; who are the Democrat co-sponsors?
@ClubRednek @JeffFlake @BarStoolHero420 Apaches should take back some of McCains privately held land in AZ. Squat if necessary
seems like common sense and a reasoned approached and hopefully that will work for once. Thank you
seems your interest is in passing a measure for passing's sake and not its efficacy. Same with your NPR interview.
not so fast! Some people do not even know why or how they are on those list! Unconstitutional in nature!
NOW, that's action for the people instead of the party!
