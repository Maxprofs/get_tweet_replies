@JeffFlake @jasoninthehouse. That is a postcard picture.
. @JeffFlake Congress did NOT shut it down! You are what is wrong with the Republican Party. It is an #ObamaReidShutdown #ccot #teaparty
@RogerWardman @JeffFlake I wrote that in response to his tweet, go look!
"Congress." @JeffFlake @7im
@commiegirl1 Speaking of @JeffFlake, he seemed sad about #Mandela yesterday. Odd since he spent much of the 80s a pro-apartheid lobbyist.
Yeah, just saw that at ThinkProgress. MT  @the_klute: @JeffFlake seemed sad about #Mandela; spent much of the 80s a pro-apartheid lobbyist.
@commiegirl1 Meanwhile, Arizona's local media is covering javelina-on-dog attacks. This is why Arizona is the worst. http://www.azcentral.com/community/scottsdale/articles/20131205scottsdale-woman-dog-survive-javelina-attack.html …
@JeffFlake @7im Haha, it's funny because he actively supported shutting down the govt but likes to pretend it was someone else's fault, haha
“@JeffFlake: Wow. My view right now. At least Congress can't shut down the sunsets. ” / At least "WE" as in GOP can't.
@MWJ1231 @JeffFlake  Obama owns the Govt Shut Down you RINO #ObamaShutDown
@HolzMAS You poor thing. I hope you find a cure.
@MWJ1231  drinking too much fruit punch at that Obama  Rally?
@JeffFlake Enjoy it while it lasts you traitor.
@JeffFlake @TheRickWilson wait 'til tomorrow, where we'll be back to "every dark cloud has a dark cloud behind it!" ;-)
“@JeffFlake: Wow. My view right now. At least Congress can't shut down the sunsets. ” <GOP WOULD IF THEY COULD.
@JeffFlake @chucktodd But they can shut down the parks and beaches from which we can view the sunsets. #congress #failing
@JeffFlake Thats nice but not as nice as St Mary's Food Bank having to ship 600 boxes of food to feed Grand Canyon employee out of work.
@17th_Tee Thanks for the support! We are happy to be able to help some of the struggling furloughed workers.
@JeffFlake thank God for that, but they would if they could
@JeffFlake tough to beat an Arizona sunset!
@JeffFlake you sound like a progressive Obama fan, with all your negative tweets about Our Congress, Coward political AK John McCain Lacky
@JeffFlake @chucktodd The Tea Party would try if it would further their agenda.
@JeffFlake Shame on the US Congress....God bless St. Mary's Food Bank.
@JeffFlake @chucktodd Thank God!  If they could, they would.....knowingl Pres. Obama enjoys it as well.....
@JeffFlake @chucktodd
@JeffFlake @chucktodd They  can't?  Maybe take 40 votes just to be sure.
@JeffFlake We had a gorgeous sunset here in Queen Creek.
@JeffFlake @chucktodd Is that a sunset or a bunch of republicans dancing around a bonfire behind the capitol lord of the flies style.
@JeffFlake @jasoninthehouse After they closed down roads to views of Mt. Rushmore, I wouldn't be so sure.
@JeffFlake Here comes @BarackObama with his sunset #Barrycades Should have kept your mouth shut.
@JeffFlake @chucktodd Boehner must be spray tanning.
@JeffFlake @chucktodd Very Beautiful pix!  But didn't u mean, At least Republicans in Congress can't shutdown the sunsets?  Your Welcome!!

“@JeffFlake: Wow. My view right now. At least Congress can't shut down the sunsets. ” Hill is good for something!
@JeffFlake @jasoninthehouse 'Congress' as in Dem Senate & pres?
@JeffFlake @chucktodd haha Jeff... That's funny how you say Congress, like you're not part of it.
@JeffFlake @chucktodd Well, maybe that's the next thing you knuckleheads will try to do to ruin America.
@JeffFlake @chucktodd But you can cause the markets to crash and thus we lose our retirement income and can’t afford to  see the sunsets!
@JeffFlake @jasoninthehouse congress didn't shutdown nothing democrats childish behavior did & admin's unwillingness to work together did.

@JeffFlake @jasoninthehouse Dude. They can find a way to block your view!
@JeffFlake A wildlife preserve in SO Okla. is #shutdown. Went there Sat. Nobody told the bison. They were openly rebelling & magnificent.
Wow. Out of touch. RT @JeffFlake: Wow. My view right now. At least Congress can't shut down the sunsets.
@JeffFlake Can you give our mutual neighbor, Matt Salmon, a slap in the back of his head.
@JeffFlake Nice, hope our's is as nice, but I'll have to look down US60.
Beautiful! "@JeffFlake: Wow. My view right now. At least Congress can't shut down the sunsets. ”
@JeffFlake @chucktodd If #presidentstompyfoot could find a way to do it, I'm sure he would.
@JeffFlake @chucktodd That's only true until @BarackObama comes out as pro-sunset.
@JeffFlake @chucktodd I'm sure the Obama gang will try their best to shut down sunsets too.
@JeffFlake Seriously?
@JeffFlake @gretchininTN No, but Arizona conservatives WILL vote you out at the next opportunity. And your Grandpa McCain, too.
.@JeffFlake They're working on it.
The #SpiteHouse plans to block out the sun and blame the GOP for ensuing chaos.  #shutdown 
@JeffFlake I'll take your sunset and raise you the Pacific Coast just after 4pm view
@JeffFlake @chucktodd ...yet.
@JeffFlake Nope, Cruz is demanding the Dems stop the sunsets too or else.
@JeffFlake @chucktodd comming from a guy who helped shut down congress..
