@JeffFlake Yes, you are!  Thank you for representing the voters of Arizona, rather than the people of NYC.
@JeffFlake The hell with that jerk.
@JeffFlake Your constituents don't like your votes either. Still ok with that?
.@JeffFlake No, Senator, you're not on the right track. Please support universal background checks--and stop joking about it. 
@dannowicki
@JeffFlake Absoluty!
@kevintobey @JeffFlake People in Hell want icewater is what you say to that.
@kevintobey @JeffFlake Hell To The Yeah!
@JeffFlake You're really batting a thousand Flake. Made a serious misstep lying to that Mom & betraying your constituents. #MomsDemandAction
.@JeffFlake Yeah! Plus your poll numbers PROVE IT!!! Oh wait.... :/
@JeffFlake Who cares what that moron thinks. He is irrelevant as the Obama people say.
@JeffFlake If your intended destination is Hell then lying to grieving parents indeed has you on the right track.
@JeffFlake @chucktodd Don't know who he is and I don't like his votes. LoL
@JeffFlake Exactly. The 2nd Amendment is very clear. Thanks for upholding your oath of office!
.@JeffFlake what do u expect after u deceived @CarenTvs and her family? @MikeBloomberg @DemandAction puts ppl b4 politics. @NRA not worth it
@JeffFlake You must be doing fine if that abomination doesn't like you!
@JeffFlake Bcoz u belong to Mexico City not an American city. Go to Mexico to promote #illegalimmigration thru #immigrationreform
@JeffFlake Have a large Coke and a smile!
@JeffFlake @chucktodd .funny thing about Bloomberg ...he hates liars like jeffFlake
@JeffFlake @chucktodd No, you're still on the wrong side of history...you and your media advisor there.
@JeffFlake did you pay for that line?  Looks good on you, though.
@JeffFlake Hey Senator, us folks in Arizona don't like your vote either, but nice try at trying to deflect your vote to Bloomberg ads.
@JeffFlake ...because Mesa AZ, that vortex of cowboy justice, is just so much more clued in than the largest city in Amerkah. #DingDong
@JeffFlake who does? You can't keep your word.
@JeffFlake 
Rightfully so, how can you send the mother of a shooting victim in which he pledged to support stronger background checks?
@JeffFlake Your absolutly right. Keep up the good work.
@JeffFlake We don't like your votes here in AS either!
@JeffFlake You go - Bloomberg sucks.
@JeffFlake I think you should get off fence.  NO fed background checks or IRS-admin will abuse just like IRS and doj violations of Const.
@JeffFlake Amen Senator... Incomprehensible how Liberals like to take away law abiding taxpaying Americans rights by politicizing tragedies.
@JeffFlake @GrrrUSA I'm sure you are distraught :-)
@JeffFlake you will be remembered :-)
@JeffFlake I guess not!  Voting against securing border first is NOT the right track.  You voted for it in 2006 - what happened to you?
@JeffFlake @CamEdwards Thanks for your 2A support. Please continue to keep up the good work and support for the 2A.
So @JeffFlake  coming from AZ w cartells buying weapons through loop holes is the right track!!?? You have no spine sir.
@JeffFlake has a butt chin.
@JeffFlake You are on the wrong track. #pondscum
@JeffFlake @chucktodd
@JeffFlake @chucktodd ill bet there are a whole lot of Arizonans who would disagree Senator. Gun control is a national issue.
@JeffFlake No you're not.
@JeffFlake no as an Az voter I know you are not doing anything on my behalf.
@JeffFlake Hope you celebrate with a 32 oz beverage. #Bloomberg is out of control!
@JeffFlake @chucktodd You're a complete asshole Jeff.
@JeffFlake @chucktodd Flake is the pimple on the ass of the fly in Mayor Bloomberg's office.
@JeffFlake @chucktodd Not for those of us in Arizona.
@JeffFlake you are on the wrong track with your amnesty bill.
@JeffFlake if u r opposite side of bloomberg I am on your side!
@JeffFlake I wish U would be less gleeful in conflict. Your vote disappointed 90% of Americans. Disagree all U want, work towards solutions.
@JeffFlake @chucktodd or too stupid to understand the basics of proper human behaviour
@JeffFlake @chucktodd So misleading the parents of shooting victims is your idea of doing something right? Interesting.
@JeffFlake  If your approval ratings are below 'pond scum' than just perhaps you are not on the right track.
.@JeffFlake -seriously jeffrey? 90% of Americans didn't like that vote. nothing short of obscene for you to be crowing about it. @dpleasant
@JeffFlake @chucktodd Yeah. Be a man. Own up to the fact that you lied to the Aurora victim's mother, Jeff. You're a Flake & a weasel.
@JeffFlake he is just trying to rid the country of politicians with no balls #gopnut
@JeffFlake I hope the ads work against you. Your a coward, and a liar.
@JeffFlake @SteveVoeller Invite him over for a smoke and a Dr. Pepper Big Gulp. Make small talk about Mariano Rivera. He's awesome.
@JeffFlake If the right track is enabling mass murderers to shoot many more people before reloading their military weapon, then yes you are!
@JeffFlake @chucktodd If being "on the right track" is voting against a common-sense measure supported by 90% of Americans, then sure.
@JeffFlake @chucktodd well done Flake. use the Mayor to fundraise against and to justify your cowardly and irresponsible vote
@JeffFlake and do you think #sandyhook would think your votes was right
@JeffFlake no amnesty. No amnesty no amnesty no amnesty. Can you HEAR us NOW? SECURE THE BORDER FIRST.
@JeffFlake yup!  Definitely on the right track to get voted out of congress.  Wrong side of history.
@JeffFlake   You are out of touch with the American people. The majority want background checks.
@JeffFlake @chucktodd keep digging, dipshit.
@JeffFlake  Agree, if you mean the track that leads right out of Congress. @chucktodd
@JeffFlake @chucktodd Well probably not this Alaskan does not much like your votes either.
@JeffFlake Ah, but if Bloomberg is on the right side of history & you're not... using him as a fundraiser won't matter. @chucktodd
@JeffFlake @u sir are a total idiot
@JeffFlake @chucktodd Just another insane Republican Mr. Flake. Say one thing to Gabby Gifford, toe the party line voting.
@JeffFlake @JulesPSpencer   how bout those amnesty votes, don't you care about conservatives ads? #getreal
@JeffFlake You're one of the biggest flakes in politics...and I don't mean your name, you #rwnj #fucking #asshole!
