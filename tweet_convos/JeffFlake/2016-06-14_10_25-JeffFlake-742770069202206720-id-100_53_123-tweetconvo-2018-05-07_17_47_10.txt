@Lonestarmomcom @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump REPLACE RYAN AND FLAKE
This might help
Not sure I get this. I am not a Trump fan. However I am a fan of stopping immig. of unvettable ppl.
It's about money, some are profiting from refugees. These two do what donors and lobbyists tell them to do
TY
Enjoy your time in Senate as Trump supporters are networking an voting you,Kirk, and Sasse out!
People watch full events unfiltered, then contrast to press & liars like you, and see the lies!
You were named Flake for a reason.
Ryan is the next to get OUT OF OFFICE. He's like Flake, A TRAITOR TO THE PARTY
Reason est could not detour us, is most Trump supporters networked on line,follow all news/ source.
U r a coward who crawls on his knees n fear,verses standing on feet to fight. No worthy of office.
Then, political analysts such as me, inform about your lies & dirty tricks.Utube airs full events
Why didn't you&Ryan speak out against Obama's immigration pause in 2011?
Yes, we will let Dems take Senate, House, State. Then 2018 candidates know must fight on feet.
Listen to Jeff Sessions:  just explained this"complete ban"and defined it.Of course it's not total!
You people r vile, and exposed as party sell outs. Can't spin us as we follow all open source info.
U r destroying Trump, we see. So we will destroy entire Republican sellout estab/vote all out!
U like to crawl on your knees& campaign 4 Clinton, well we are going to vote ALL Republicans out!
@politico Flake's brave now because he's not up for re-election, but he will be.. we'll remember.
@MightyGopher1 @JeffFlake @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump Ryan da Cheese head wit bunch of holes,start,n to get moldy time 2trash
#DumpRyan
@politico Leadership? Ryan gives Obama everything he wants. Ryan is a Democratic operative
Trump supporters & 80% of party sick to death of your running him & party down coward!
Trump is proposing 2 temp limit those from countries w/ terrorist issues,& over 55% of US agrees!
ryan SHOULD speak against trump #partyoverpeople
Flake--we will remember your lack of support for the voter. Remember us?
So glad you believe biased Politico.
Be sur to read your Washington Post too! The more the merrier!
That is pulse of the grass roots. We know who is taking Trump down. Tons of FB page/email networks.
We would rather die on our feet than live on our knees, & not voting 4 crawlers anymore. Done.
So when we cote every last one of you out, no need to wonder why.
.@JeffFlake @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump  We don't appreciate your efforts in bringing dangerous Muslims & endangering our families
How about you go with the will of the people!? It's not your agenda....it's ours! @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump @politico
Ryan is a traitor to his Party and to the American peopleJust like Flake. Why don't they protect us
Very unhappy with these divisive tweets. Stop! We need November's WIN! Don't you see these are only hurting us for goodness sake.
@politico Ryan and Flake, two cronies!
@politico Shouldn't you be the senator from Massachusetts?
It's why you could not, and will not break us. U are a low tax Democrat. So, best let real 1s win!
No difference between Clinton/Obama, and u, Sasse, Kirk, Ryan, and Romney.You are one in same.
If any Republican believe they can when when 1/2 party votes against them, good luck.
YOU r beyond  pale w/ your lies.If est takes down Trump, bulk Trump supporters voting all Rep out!
@politico DONALD TRUMP IS A TERRORIST WE MUST BAN ALL GUNS

You don't have mi ne
@politico can you say: Caliphate, Sharia Law, World domination, Convert or die, Jihad? #JeffFake
No, leadership is what you're doing--he still supports the racist.
@politico Ryan is a traitor to the Republican Party @AzRepublicans @NRSC @republican @SenateGOP
You really went out on a limb - "not sure" it's in our country's interest??  Believe me - it's NOT.
I voted for you before but never again.  Trump said stop immigration temporarily not ban forever
@politico You are a flake! This Arizona GOP voter will work tirelessly to make sure you lose seat!
@politico RR
But I still feel that anyone who endorses Mr. Trump is putting party and power over the future of our country.
@politico He's just trying to save his political career after supporting a racist demagogue.
thank you for standing against bigotry. Here's a link 2 your followers about our refugee vetting process.
How do you know it's applied?!
This is SOP governed by the State dept. There is no news to the contrary. No one has suggested side stepping this.
@politico Jeff it's great to denounce, but let's deendorse!
@kmledf2 @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump @politico there will come a lot of "speaking up against"this year...good luck @SpeakerRyan
@politico are you unaware that much of our problems are coming from the Muslim population ?
The problem is caused by those bringing them here
@politico but if nominee becomes Pres. then what?
"appreciative"

#WeakSauce
Would some sensible restrictions on super-powerful weapons be in the nation's interest?
