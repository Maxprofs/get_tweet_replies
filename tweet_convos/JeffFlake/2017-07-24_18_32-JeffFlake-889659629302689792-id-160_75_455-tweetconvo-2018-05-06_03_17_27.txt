Glad the senator is well enough to wreak havoc and join you voting to take away healthcare from those who need it most  Stop voting party
Also great to see Sen McCain get healthcare when he's sick. Please don't take that away from millions of Americans.
That is #AAwesome! Thanks for the shout-out, Senator.
Really @AmericanAir? Frequent business traveler WITH airline choices and this tweet is extremely disappointing.

#NeverFlake @JeffFlake we are going to run a campaign head and shoulders above any #rinos to #MAGA 
Fuck John McCain! He will get his Karma (death by brain cancer) delivered very soon for his vote to rip healthcare from millions.
AZ voter here...vote no on any repeal without a GOOD replacement. #HealthCareVote #HealthCareIsARight
@JeffFlake None of you are focused on reducing costs of HC? Pharma, Ins cos, hospitals all get a pass. Fx the problem. #VoteNo
No need for you to spend money on ANY reelection campaign. A yes vote and you are pretty much done and over. 
#KillTheBill
VOTE NO ON HEALTH BILL TODAY! SEND A MESSAGE TO THIS CORRUPT ADMINISTRATION!
Senator, be a hero today for the majority of Americans. Vote NO to proceed with this "fake" trump care bill!
Glioblastoma in 80 year old; he s not going to get better so pointless to sign any " get well "  card.
McCain should be forced to retire for crying out loud.
McCain, willing to leave home & his taxpayer funded HC to go to Washington & take HC away from millions of hardworking Americans.  Shameful!
I wished him well and still do. To bad he and you don't feel the same about the millions that won't be able to afford hlth care
taking away the same health care we the people provide you that we wish to provide for the less fortunate among us is less that honorable.
Wait, do you mean McCain is on the flight or that you brought a card on your flight?
He's on the flight. Repulicans are willing to risk his health to take healthcare away from millions of us. It's disgusting!
HE's willing to risk his health to take healthcare away from hard working Americans. No one's forcing him. His legacy.

When are you next?
If you can't stand up for our most vulnerable in AZ then you have no business calling yourself a United Stated Senator! @GOP #KillTheBill
Why aren't you talking about healthcare?

Watch for the Democratic landslide in the next election on single payer platform if you repeal.
Interesting that the Senate opted OUT of their own proposed plan.  Yet you would subject us to that plan.   We die, you live.  VOTE NO
Your vote, his vote, are votes for ALL Americans.  We deserve the same HC you enjoy - single payer. VOTE NO

How much did you pay them to sign. Plus I doubt there was any from Arizona because he screwed us
You loving Macains now? Fake! UR OUT
Vote no on this cruel & cynical bill. It will end your career & forever tarnish your reputation. You'll be remembered only for this vote.
Awesome @AmericanAir for hero @SenJohnMcCain.
I did that PHX-DCA forever.
please vote NO.
Hoping we can trust both of you to put your constituents' needs over that of party & the psychic free-fall of #PublicServant45. #SaveACA
@JeffFlake Type 1 diabetic Arizonan, w 3 kids. Without affordable hc I don't watch my kids grow old. #VoteNo #VoteNoTrumpcare #Arizona
Making deals with mobsters like Trump/Putin or Koch Syndicate never ends well. They are enemies to the people & will betray you. #SaveACA
Vote no on Trump care.
help curb drug and mental health issues by keeping families connected to their physicians and health community.  An oz. of prevention is....
Senator Flake please use this opportunity to act like a statesman and an American. Work on a bipartisan healthcare bill. Please!
Please consider voting NO to repeal the healthcare of millions of children who depend on the meds/doctor visits for chronic illness. We can.
Cheering as you rip healthcare from the poor, disabled, young and old! Screw you jeff and screw @SenJohnMcCain
Awful process. Awful bill. Today's the day you were elected for - to  ignore the KOCH/PAC $$ and STAND WITH US. It's pass or fail. VOTE NO!
Vote no on MTP!  Save the ACA.
That was cool.  Was on flight with you to D.C.
Thank God he didn't fly United.  Seeing Senator McCain being beaten up and dragged off a plane would be intolerable.
Please listen to your consitiuents and vote NO on the mystery healthcare bill. @dougducey
As a Republican I'm asking you to put your constituents above the party line and big donors by voting NO today on healthcare.
McCain surely enjoyed his healthcare.  Don't take it away from millions of Americans.  You are voting for people to live or die.  Vote NO!!!
Vote NO on this disastrous health care bill. I'm a constituent of Arizona and won't forgive  if you do. 2018 is coming..
Don't repeal Obama care. Universal health care for the U.S. is more important now than ever.
Vote against the motion to proceed.
If he was close to lifetime cap when he battled cancer yrs ago,does it mean this new dx would have maxed him out? So ACA is saving his life?
It would make my day if @SenJohnMcCain voted NO today on the secret GOP plan. A week ago he opposed a vote, wanted hearings, normal process.
This is all great, Jeff. And how will You be voting on Trumpcare, Sir?
NO on repeal!  this bill will kill people. What if your God was one of us ?
No idea of bill contents
No CBO score
No public hearings
No input frm stakeholders
Likely 22M+ lose HC
Why rush?
#VoteNoOnMTP
#NoTrumpCare #fixobamacare
Glad to see McCain gets the best healthcare and us ants get to die. AZ we did this to ourselves. Stop voting rich in they don't care!
VOTE NO ON THE Healthcare bill and full repeal.  People's lives are at stake. We will remember.
Time for we the people to call Congress AGAIN! Kill DeathCare

How much will your rates increase, @JeffFlake? Signed, AZ Constituent
Please save the ACA..It saves lives. Say NO tomorrow
Hope it inspires y'all to #SaveTheACA Love, A Constituent
Shameful
Trump turns WV kids jamboree into a political rally to push a bill that pushes a disproportionate % of West Virginia parents off insurance. https://twitter.com/nbcnightlynews/status/889619003068620804 …
represent your constituents tomorrow and vote to not repeal ACA or what's  being voted on. Modify ACA.That's the right thing to do.
With all due respect for Sen. McCain, when will you LISTEN to your constituents and put people over party!? #ProtectOurCare
Country first gentlemen. AZ will be hit very badly unless you vote no. Cross the aisle and work on a fix. #voteno
Does Flake ever respond on Twitter?
Must have notifications turned off. Jeff? You there?
We demand a "No" vote on repeal of ACA
Urging you to vote NO on trumpcare!! Please save lives! This is just a tax break for wealthiest!!
Flake. Are you going to man up and vote against this crap #billionairewelfare bill? Or do you have Twitter on mute like your town halls?
Now, stand up for real health care for people with pre-existing conditions. What saves John can save others. Stand up for our children
VOTE NO

Trumpcare is  joke  YOU know it.. Not right for Arizona and NOT right for the country #NoBCRA 
Everything is at steak here #resist
Rooting hard for his recovery. He's getting GREAT healthcare. As are you. I am hoping you do the same for the Arizona people.
Vote no on attempts to destroy ACA. Over 20 million would lose coverage. Elderly HURT! Premiums will rise for those who need care most!

A GOOD man who loves his wife should not have to consider divorce so she could qualify for help w/cancer. #InSicknessAndInHealth 
Jeff I call you frequently.  Vote NO on tRump care. Arizona will lose many jobs in the health care industry which is huge here in AZ
Vote NO on #TrumpCare . Every credible analysis has shown it's terrible for Arizonans. -Constituent from 86327
Vote No tomorrow!
Vote no on this healthcare bill Senators. To do otherwise is to ignore your country and its constituents.
Praying you both will do the good and decent thing and vote No tomorrow . I know you are both men of character.
Millions of Americans will find out whether they live or die tomorrow. That hinges on your vote. Do the right thing. #VOTENO
Time to make sure that all Americans have health care like McCain, vote no on taking care from americans
Great to see so many GOP senators voting for a bill they haven't read which will harm millions and affects 1/6 of US economy.

#KeepKidsCovered
Dr Samaddar on why Medicaid is important for AZ children. #ProtectOurCare #KeepKidsCovered @SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake 
Please Senators, 32 million American voters will lose their healthcare if you vote yes tomorrow. #notrumpcare
So he can come back and take health care away from millions. He needs to just go away. Awful. As he is staring death in the eye. #impeach45
Give the rest of us decent healthcare. Vote NO on the current Senate plan and no on ACA repeal.
Vote no on repeal and replace. It will be devastating to the area that your FAMILY LIVES IN. Shame on you!!!!!
It'd be pretty sad for him to go all the way back to Washington to vote for a bill he can't possibly favor.
Please vote no on the healthcare bill. You have the power to save lives & to be a bipartisan leader. Do not support Trump's irrationality
Vote NO on this tragedy of a healthcare bill!! 
TELL ME, WHO CARES IF YOU DON'T? 
NO on REPEAL!!!
Please vote No on healthcare. Protect my right to continue with my AZ HC w/my employer, can't afford to lose what I have!! I'm 59, please!
Please vote NO tomorrow
Have u seen the bill yet? Is 45 harassing u into signing it? Be a man - no, be a SENATOR for ur people in AZ (me!) and oppose this bill!
Do not repeal the ACA, it's cruel and cynical. This is not how you do tax breaks.
He needs to retire.  McCain is too old.
Hope you vote no on Republican Healthcare Bill
 End this now please.
Such a cutie
I hope this means you both are voting "NO" on this abomination are are ready to craft a bipartisan workable healthcare plan.
I hope someone wrote to him asking him to vote no. It IS a nice thing they did.
When he realizes under this plan he wouldn't be able to get healthcare.  But then we don't get our coverage at expense of the people
Please don't vote to deny health care to millions of the most vulnerable Americans!
I don't trust him to do the right thing, just to say the right thing then do another. 
#2017inreview
Please vote no on the MTP. Please.
A week passed since he had that surgery! Of course Republicans want him back to work by now. Chop Chop. Vote Democrat, vote humanity!
I'm glad @SenJohnMcCain is headed to D.C.  Please do the right thing and vote no on #HealthcareBill
Save my Liberty #MedicaidMatters
So "great" to see them happy he's coming to vote to take away a procedure millions in America can't possibly afford WITH health insurance.
It's disgusting. Your party is disgusting.
Very nice. Now business. If you want to continue in your job vote NO on the DeathCare bill that 83% of your constituents are against. 2018!
Vote no tomorrow Senator; it's the right thing to do.
Vote no tomorrow or you will be gone in 2018
Vote No on MTP and TrumpCare. Save my life.
And my freedom.#savemedicaid
Vote NO on #TrumpCare - @SenJohnMcCain has great healthcare - don't take away the only care millions of Americans depend on.
This never gets old!  Vote NO on MTP your king people and don't care. No one should face medical bankruptcy in the greatest country in 
Since it seems no one knows what you are voting on, no would be the way to go.
As an AZ voter, Im disgusted that You would support McCain risking his health to join you in this death panel .. You disgust me Jeff!
Vote no.  Repeal: 32 million lose coverage
Repeal and replace: 23 million lose coverage

Both are unacceptable.
Please vote NO tomorrow on the Trumpcare crap!
And lets hope both AZ senators vote AGAINST the health care act that will put over 22 million off medicaid!!
@GOP Should be disgusted with themselves to force McCain to put this ridicuious vote before his health! PLZ Vote NO! Give ppl a chance
Sure they can put it in their scrapbooks as McCain flies to DC TO CAUSE AMERICANS TO DIE to deprive them of healthcare he, a millionaire has
Don't vote yes Senator Flake!
@LoopEmma @SenJohnMcCain @AmericanAir Does that mean you're voting NO?
Life's a bitch.
Great to see a new AZ Senator in 2018 after you vote for this disaster. We expected better. #NoToFlakeIn2018
Your idle thoughts never cease to amaze - this while you're prepping to hurt millions??? Really???

How will you explain to someone in Phoenix that they will play 4x, 50% more, or 2x what hey pay under ACA @JeffFlake & @SenJohnMcCain? 
tomorrow a No vote on this closed door healthcare bill is the right thing to do. AZ voter.
Please vote no on the secret mean HC bill. #KillTheBill not the People. AZ needs both you and @SenJohnMcCain to protect us.
They don't care about us. They care about their donors.
I have never felt more disgusted.
Off to strip healthcare protections and Medicaid from millions of people? Gosh, you mavericks, you.
SHAME on all republicans willing to put Sen McCain's health at risk for this terrible healthcare bill that he already voiced opposition to.
He could die for god sakes. He just had brain surgery! Crazy
I can only assume he's flying to vote against the repeal.
Maybe when you're facing death he won't be able to do that to Medicade and Medicare. 
Interesting to watch you guys wish McCain well, and obsess about one British child's health, as you move to rip health care from millions.
He really shouldn't be flying.
