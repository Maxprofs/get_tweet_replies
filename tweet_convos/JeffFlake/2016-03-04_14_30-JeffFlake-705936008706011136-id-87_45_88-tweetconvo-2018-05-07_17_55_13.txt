@GenetteGary @SenJohnMcCain the people of Arizona support @realDonaldTrump. The same people that always vote for YOU. Remember that. #Unite.
@1CristinaPena @new_debis @GenetteGary @SenJohnMcCain @realDonaldTrump : here is a thought
@mcicero10 @new_debis @GenetteGary @SenJohnMcCain @realDonaldTrump
@SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake @WSJ we need a broader law. There chopping off heads! And laughing about it. Choice is Trump or Clinton!
@SenJohnMcCain @WSJ time for mccain to retire.
@SenJohnMcCain Like Trump can be trusted?
@senjohnmccain Good.  Torture?  We don't need any more of that.
@SenJohnMcCain only positive news that would be good you leaving US and never coming back oh wait u will not be reelected just as good.
@SenJohnMcCain @WSJ he said would change the law. I guess you support Islamofascists cutting off heads. Time to retire
@SenJohnMcCain Thank you for ushering Sarah Palin into the American consciousness, the warm up to Donald Trump. SHAME ON YOU & YOUR PARTY!!!
@SenJohnMcCain but he believes in intimidating ppl who disagree with him. White supremacy supporters who violently remove blk ppl #foxnews
did you see?
Ear piercing cheers for waterboarding here in Mechanicsburg, PA.
and also?
Trump spox on ad casting his "I like people who weren't captured" remark as anti-POW slur: "was off-cuff remark mainly about John McCain: "
@SenJohnMcCain  That would be a negative, everyone against it should watch the video again of the guy being burned alive.
@SenJohnMcCain “What we need is the voice of the people,” said Ms. Sheptoski-Forbush. “The voice of the people want Trump.”
@SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake  Trump in office good for Amer. Clinton in office good for u Politicians. Suppressing the will of the people?
@SenJohnMcCain Trump/Kasich ticket in November!
@SenJohnMcCain @WSJ the last person to tell the people what they wanted to hear was named Adolf
@SenJohnMcCain Even his mid election changes are okay as long as it's none of you guys. Get it. We're sick of all of you.
@SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake Trump reversing himself is not "a positive development".  It means nothing, as he isn't trustworthy.
@SenJohnMcCain @damianpaletta it's a positive change b/c his staff warned him he had to but still can't so promised to extend the law
@SenJohnMcCain Don't support @realDonaldTrump when he gets the nominee and wins the presidency. If you don't like it, Retire &Go Home!
@SenJohnMcCain @damianpaletta Your staying in the GOP shows your approval of GOP Nazi Gestapo polities! It's not what you've done!
@SenJohnMcCain @realDonaldTrump Give it time...He'll flip flop back again
@SenJohnMcCain Sir,I am disappointed that instead of educating the front runner you have chosen to follow a two time failed Mitt Romney!
@SenJohnMcCain @WSJ mccain lost in 2008.  McCain lost in 2008.   McCain lost in 2004.   Go away.  B
@SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake @damianpaletta why post stories on Twitter when you can't read them for free , what's the point ??!!
@SenJohnMcCain U left your mind in a hole in Vietnam.
@SenJohnMcCain your no hero.
@SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake Now you two sell-outs can get behind him again. #NeverTrump #NeverMcCain #NeverFlake
@SenJohnMcCain & he supports violence,  screaming at events "GET EM OUTTA HERE" . Bigot, racist. & u support this guy?Awful person #foxnews
@SenJohnMcCain we don't fall for it WSJ
@JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain with all due respect Senators it does not make me feel any better.  Please do not endorse this man. #NeverTrump
@SenJohnMcCain GIVE US ALL A BREAK! Trump changes his mind like he changes his ties!.....Daily! You GOP grey-tooth's are such easy marks.
@SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake until he reverses it again tomorrow
@SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake An even more positive development would be "Trump drops out of presidential race."
@SenJohnMcCain he's a two faced liar that will do and say anything for votes. Kind of like you! #RetireMcCain
@SenJohnMcCain @damianpaletta he will change his mind tomorrow and flip again! #NeverTrump
@SenJohnMcCain Why? How is this even a "development?" Trump just says stuff. It has no meaning. Provides no clue as to what he would do.
@SenJohnMcCain Would be more "positive" if @realDonaldTrump  drop from the race.
@SenJohnMcCain @WSJ @realDonaIdTromp His anger therapy is working?
@SenJohnMcCain called us crazies first #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #John8:7  @WSJ
@SenJohnMcCain @damianpaletta Oh. So no worries then. Still #NeverTrump
@SenJohnMcCain @WSJ Not genuine.  One who wishes to 'reign' by fear and intimidation.  Pity for all who don't obey. #NeverTrump
@SenJohnMcCain .....good good good for him....mini Mussolini
@SenJohnMcCain That's bullshit and we all know it.  He's just saying that to get his ass out of a jam with the military.  He'll do whatever
@SenJohnMcCain what is not positive is the mob mentality of his supporters that would follow him through War crimes. They cheered
@SenJohnMcCain @damianpaletta You are very naive Senator.  trump has no respect for you.  Why would anyone believe him?  Stand your ground.
@SenJohnMcCain  I don't think Donald Trump was wrong to suggest that we target terrorist families--though torture is not the right way.
@SenJohnMcCain  Foreign Policy has always progressed from Intelligience Expertise and the League of Nations, why don't you know that?
@SenJohnMcCain @damianpaletta Should you retire along with Hypocrite Harry...We are tired of you both
@SenJohnMcCain The fact that he said it in the first place means he has no place near the WH. Its not a development, its Damage control.
@SenJohnMcCain @rebeccaballhaus @damianpaletta Flip flop like a fish out of water. #NeverTrump
@SenJohnMcCain The fact that he had to reverse himself because he seems unaware of international laws should disqualify him for candidacy
@SenJohnMcCain I voted for you believed in you now you still not listening to voters
@SenJohnMcCain he is willing to learn and John McCain is a good man.
@SenJohnMcCain It's all about the votes not about principles!
@SenJohnMcCain @damianpaletta too little too late
@SenJohnMcCain  yea but tomorrow//he could change his mind //
@SenJohnMcCain just so you can see Republican in the White House.If you actually support him just because he wears an R,you lost my respect
@SenJohnMcCain @rebeccaballhaus @damianpaletta he will reverse back
@SenJohnMcCain He can back track on everything & he is still NOT presidential material. If U stand w him U R as bad.
@SenJohnMcCain so it was an uninformed stance to start - just like so many more (deporting illegals, eliminating deficit) - positive not!
@SenJohnMcCain @damianpaletta Funny how it's "flip-flopping" if it's not liked & "reversing stance" if it is liked.
@SenJohnMcCain @damianpaletta flip flop draft dodger who used fathers influ 2 evade CBT in VN Disgraceful. Knows nothing about mil.Dangrous
@SenJohnMcCain Not positive if he is still the nominee. Trump needs to be kicked to curb (quickly)
@SenJohnMcCain pls pls shout out to #FreeSavchenko dying on hunger strike
@SenJohnMcCain He is a good man and loves the country
@SenJohnMcCain surely you don't buy it? It's just another switch for the cameras.
@SenJohnMcCain @damianpaletta Senator, I appreciate your optimism, but does anyone believe this stance will hold. Flip flop is dizzying!
@SenJohnMcCain @damianpaletta wow we should all be so proud, he doesn't want to commit war crimes any more #NeverTrump
@SenJohnMcCain - please, don't try to excuse @realDonaldTrump. He's still a bigot and a racist.
@peteswicked @SenJohnMcCain @realDonaldTrump Doesn't Donald  remind you of the classic used car salesman?
@SenJohnMcCain And oh, so sincere.
