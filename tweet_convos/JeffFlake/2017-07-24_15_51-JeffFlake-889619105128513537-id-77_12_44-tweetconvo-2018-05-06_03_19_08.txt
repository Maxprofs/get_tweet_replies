You know how hard we got hit from #Obamacare. We are struggling because of #ACA. You promised us you would vote down Obamacare. #RepealACA
protecting clean water ended with ur vote 4Pruitt ur next vote takes all Az off Medicaid & insurance shame on u
JeffFlake, have u voted against EVEN ONE of Trump's nominees. EVEN ONE??? Not just ideology-you KNOW many r corrupt unqualified or unhinged.
Don't help @POTUS or @JeffFlake do anything else on the Russian @GOP agenda. Block the invasion of our democracy that flake obviously hates

THIS is the problem and why we need universal healthcare
Hey Flakey! 

Your DC mailbox is full. May want to actually listen to your constituents before voting. 

Id get on it.
"...oversee an Interior Department that has dealings with clients who have paid his law firm millions of dollars in legal and lobbying fees"
You were a hero on the baseball field. TY. Will you be a hero on healthcare? #FixACA Stop sabotaging ACA. Vote no on MTP

Your DC mailbox is full. I called the Tucson office to express my opinion about the BCRA vote(very calm/polite) & your staff hung up on me.
Maybe Flake can stand up for his constituents, I mean employers, and vote against this abomination. How about it? No on #billionairewelfare
Stop the obstruction.Get President Trumps staff confirmed.Dems should be ashamed. This affects our country &dragging their feet is criminal
Working to make water companies rich doesn't make you a water expert.

#NeverFlake @JeffFlake we are going to run a campaign head and shoulders above any #rinos to #MAGA 
I saw you on the news today. How can you say getting a S C judge is a success when the Republican's ripped this from the Democrats?

Need to throw flake out
U will not be reelected
Please don't take away millions of Arizonans' #Healthcare.
No Jeff he is also a corporate insider who has conflict of interests!!
Clean water is important. So is HEALTHCARE! Please don't take it away from 32mil people that depend on it to survive.  People over party!
I don't think I believe this tweet, Jeff. Your president doesn't hire experts.
VOTE NO Hurting seniors and the needy!  AARP will expose the rubber stamping Senators.
This includes printing each Senator's health care vote in the AARP Bulletin, which is read by 30.4 million Americans.
Frackers shouldn't be part of The Interior Department.
You sicken me Jeffy. You're out in 2018!
Oh really? Pardon me for thinking u don't give a damn about us in AZ! U vote yes on any of the rotten HC we know u don't give a Sh.t aboutus
So. You gonna just hit it and quit it? How are you voting on #billionairewlefare?
Water expert?  What are you smoking?  Every appointment made benefits business and industry and will harm our country!
VOTE THIS COWARD FLAKE OUT!!!
#MAGA
Just read about him--another Koch man. I hope there is something beautiful when you people get done

please vote no on BCRA and its foul spawn... you're better than this
ur h20should be rationed 24/7/365.All of AZ should have2 let it mellow if it's yellow.

Hi I'm in your state and call daily to tell you about my daughter and what the ACA and Medicaid mean to us.
yes but where is he on climate change????
You have bigger things to focus on first - like the #TrumpRussia scandal and the TERRIBLE #Trumpcare bills. Listen to AZ voters! #VoteNo
Pleased? You should be ashamed. Bernhardt reps oil, mining (open pit no less, in AZ).  Water expert? Water spoiler!
Does he believe in #climatechange & the need to mitigate human activity which accelerates the decline of our planet's environment? Hope so!
Nope - history of representing oil companies & agricultural interests, involved in representing other mining, oil, and extractive industries

Die in at the US Capitol.  https://www.pscp.tv/w/bEUMRzQxNDg1MjN8MXlOR2FtenZXa3ZHas1Kr3qM2LzqfjvWFdinAswDFEOtypokAUyINqXozKdQ …
Surely anyone he nominates will be anti-nature and for deregulation.
Your constituents would be more pleased if you vote no on Trumpcare.
As a USFWS retiree and Arizonan, you've confirmed yet  another bad pick.  Your track record of party line confirmations is disheartening
Vote NO on tomorrow's motion to proceed on healthcare bill.
What about the People here in AZ? A lot of people depend on Medicare and Medicaid. Protect your constituents and vote No on unknown HC bill.
Your not going to pull a Flint Michigan on us are you?
You are REALLY going to vote for a healthcare bill that you know nothing about and that will devastate millions of Americans? Unconscionable
Is he going to ruin the environment like Pruitt
Vote no on repeal and replace. You are SCREWING Az
'''Please Repeal OBAMACARE for it is destroying the Middle Class!
It's hard to care about this when #Healthcare is at stake right now for Americans. #BCRA #wealthcare
The World Does Not Stop because the Democrats Passed an Asinine Self Destructive Health Bill in 2009
Please vote against this terrible health care bill!   We don't even know what is in it!!!!
Protect water from whom?
Or protect it for whom????? Your constituents? Or the Big Money Corp$ that you are constantly siding with??
How do you feel about potus' attack on fellow senators and AG? Does he make you proud Jeff?
You are not securing a bright future for yourself Jeff
Which you are A-OK polluting. You are no friend of the environment. Good thing we'll all be dead from lack of healthcare. 2018 is coming.

This health care bill isn't simply unconscionable and unjust. It's unconstitutional.

We won't stand for it.
