, Why? Isn't this what you wanted when you voted against UBC? Aren't your #NRA overlords pleased? #shameonyou
now it's time to act. 90% want UBC. #DoYourJob
nice -how abt #GOP stop Arming domestic terrorists? Support #filibuster & .@GOP NRA  pay for 49 Funerals
No terrorist should be able to buy a weapon of war on US soil. Vote #NoFlyNoBuy #DisarmHate Work to #EndGunViolence
Gun laws are not what caused this radical extremism did.If not a gun they would have found another way.
DEEP SORROW FOR YOUR HISTORY OF VOTING AS WELL???
Why? You and Ryan support Muslims in America. And this it what we have to suffer because you fail to protect us. HYPOCRITE
Yeah, "deep sorrow" is no match for a bought politician. Actions Mr. Flake.
How about vote to keep terrorist OUT OF THE USA! Logic much ppl
.@JeffFlake Great, now DO something about it. Ban assault weapons for starters. DO SOMETHING!
They are banned. Need a class 3 to own them by law.
#makeitstop
Return your #NRA contributions today. Otherwise, this is meaningless
blood is on your hands. #MakeItStop
DO SOMETHING
your sorrow means nothing until you DO something! #makeitstop
so importing more like minded terrorists fixes that problem for us?Makes life better for us how? You go first, in ur neighborhood
Do more than just pray. ACT on sensible gun control. Please, now.
Vote to stop the violence or you are part of the problem #orlando @JeffFlake
MAKE IT STOP!!! #orlando
How many more American citizens have to die before you think it's the appropriate time to take action?
Mass deportations and no immigration from the third world especially the ME. Bring nothing to the table. Ban assault muds.
Your sorrow sucks because (just like post-Newtown) it's too weak to lead to action. You had the power today to TAKE ACTION.
Do something about it, then. You are one of the few Americans who can directly do so.
Why did you vote to protect the rights of terror suspects to buy guns on 12/03/15? Your words are meaningless. #BloodOnYourHands
glad that you feel horrified.  How about you do something to end mass shootings? Ban assault weapons! #makeitstop
Your sorrow is not what we need. We need change in DC!! Please vote to change the gun laws! #filibuster #enough
why won't you mention the LGBT community in your heartfelt comments? Are you afraid to care?
.@JeffFlake words count less than deeds. VOTE to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists. Otherwise you're unfit for office.
please vote to stop tragedies like Orlando, Aurora, Sandy Hook, Charleston from happening. Please make it harder for terrorists
No civilian should have the ability to obtain military assault weapons. Ban the AR-15 from civilian use!
Having "deep sorrow" for the victims will not prevent the casualty number from going up.
it's time to get on the right side of history. Keep guns away from terrorists and #disarmhate.
do the right thing for gun control. you have a soul in there, don't you?
Show sorrow by voting for background checks!! @JeffFlake
you killed them.
Hey @JeffFlake your bad call legally lets people secure military weapons. Your sorrow means nothing if you're not doing anything to help.
how's about instead of feeling deep sorrow you do something about it and change the gun accessibility laws. same 4 @senjohnmccain
85712 constituent, just W of Saguaro NP
I stand w/ #filibuster in DEMANDING a vote; TOO MANY DEAD!
PS Yer comments voicemail full
thanks for the deep sorrow. Now it's time to act. Walk down & ask a question. #filibuster
Then please do something about it! #Enough #NoFlyNoBuy Your moment of silence is deafening in its lack of action.
Here is your chance to do something. Do you have the courage to say #Enough ??
.@JeffFlake - Will we see you at the #filibuster? I expect the response will be #silence
As a new resident to AZ, I'm disappointed to see your record on voting to help/represent the NRA and against background checks.
you could have prevented this tragedy with your vote in late 2015 on b. checks. Be better.
Your sorrow does nothing.  Ban assault weapons!
Then close the #terrorgap and promote #guncontrol.  Where's the bill? https://thetab.com/us/2016/06/14/i-was-able-to-buy-an-ar-15-in-five-minutes-19833 …
sorrow is not enough anymore. #dosomething #ENOUGH
DO SOMETHING!!! #noassualtweaponsinaz
you helped that man kill those people.
military grade weapons should not be owned by private citizens in the first place
I'm not okay with that.
you are one of the people who voted that people who are on the FBI terrorist watch list should be allowed to buy assault rifles
if you really feel "sorrow" then do something.
thoughts and prayers only go so far. Your votes do more. We need to start taking steps towards change. We need gun laws reformed
LIAR.  if you felt any sorrow, you would take action against allowing suspected terrorists from buying AR-15s #notfoolinganyone
Your "sorrow" is useless. Legislation to undo "well regulated militia" so that anyone can purchase any weapon anytime means more
Your opposition to assault weapon ban and background checks led to these deaths.  #DoYourJob #GunSenseVoter #MassMurderer
Actions speak louder than words.
As elected official who does the bidding of @NRA, you're accomplice to the 50 murders in Orlando. Worth the price of your soul?
. @JeffFlake We don't need your sorrow. We need action. We need to reinstate the ban on semi-automatic weapons. #ProudArizonaVoter
Your deep sorrow is meaningless. You are complicit. GUN REFORM NOW. #Orlando
You sure? Because you are part of the problem. This is on you all these other greedy politicians
you allowed this terrorist to legally purchase guns. We depend on you to keep us safe in public spaces. Act now! Do your job!
Maybe if you voted in favor of stricter gun laws, Orlando shooting could have been prevented. #NRAInYourBackPocket
DO SOMETHING!!!
we don't want your sorrow, we want you to vote for stricter background checks, we want you to vote for ban on assault rifles...
you voted against background checks. Do something about it now
shut up and do something about it
Your positions and policies gave us Trump and gun massacres. If you want change, man up and buck your antiquated party.
.@JeffFlake You voted to let this terrorist get a gun. You voted against bg checks. You are responsible for these 50 deaths. Shame on you.
remember this next time you vote to allow ppl on the terrorist watch list to obtain ar-15s. Just sayin.
you could have prevented this. Make stricter gun laws.
.@JeffFlake Your deep sorrow is meaningless; you voted AGAINST background checks for commercial gun purchases, shame on your hypocrisy!
Your deep sorrow is meaningless. You are complicit. GUN REFORM NOW. #Orlando
just a reminder of your vote to allow terrorists to buy weapons….how much NRA $$$s have YOU taken?
.@JeffFlake you vote to make hate deadly so you can keep cashing NRA checks right @igorvolsky?
@Teachercat2 @JeffFlake @igorvolsky AZ congressman with HIs Head Up His ASS
Your sorrow is lovely, but you know what would be even more lovely? Do your job and stop kowtowing to the #NRA. #BanAssaultRifles
:  was it worth it?
: You voted against background Checks. You can do something about this. I hope you do.
Can't fly,  but allowed to legally buy assault weapons.  #GOPLogic #OrlandoShooting #NeverTrump
That's all you got, Jeff? For God's sake, do something!
What you're following @JeffFlake are results of yours & the @GOP's craven servitude to the @NRA & #WeaponsProfiteers

cc @POTUS @SenatorReid
Yo @JeffFlake 

For the record, dude:

How much more have you groveled before @NRA to get?

cc @POTUS @SenatorReid
Flake's own "friend" took a violent bullet in her brain and still, Flake couldn't stand up
terrorist was on the watch list and STILL legally bought a gun!!!
Your party voted against bill 2 stop terrorists frm buying weapons; takes$$$ from NRA; hates LGBT people; #notdeepsorrow #gophate
@LizMair How many $$$ from the NRA?
.@JeffFlake Your sorrow means nothing. By taking $365K from NRA & voting against gun control, you're complicit in #Orlando massacre.
Sources show you receiving funds from @NRA. We know where you stand. It's not with the victims. You'll let this happen again.
hope to see you vote for expanded gun control and background checks to prevent further tragedies like this.
Then why did you vote AGAINST the Assault Weapons Ban?  And how do you sleep at night? #ENOUGH
Maybe if you got behind Donald Trump this could be stopped. I am done supporting you in Arizona until you get behind the party.
every day you stall common sense gun control reform, you enable terrorists. Do something 2 protect the citizens you claim 2 serve
DHS call off investigation of San Bernardino terrorist its NOT PC then they attack; now this. You idiots are responsible.
Horrific event!  Time for you to get behind your GOP candidate now!
We must ban assault rifles
Will this be the tragedy that finally breaks your allegiance to the #NRA and allows me to support you?
enough sorrow to expand background checks on gun purchases? Or to ban assault rifles? If not, then your words are meaningless.
Thank you @JeffFlake now #doyourjob and pass gun control.
Following horrific events in Orlando. Deep sorrow for the victims of this tragedy.
