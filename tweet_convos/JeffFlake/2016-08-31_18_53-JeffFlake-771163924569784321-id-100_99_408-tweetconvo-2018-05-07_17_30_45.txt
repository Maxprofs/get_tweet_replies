You can if you're California @JeffFlake
California sunsets are the best
enjoy it, #useless
Only with a Trump cloud.
while I don't vote GOP, I give u respect 4 standing up 2 bully trump & being professional. Mud slinging isn't smart debate.
A jerk off that cares more about being right than the American people, thanks for putting yourself above the rest of us.
you can with Texas sunrises.
Unless of course, you live in Florida.
Jeffery, you could never be elected in the Great and Sovereign State of Mississippi.  You are failing to support GOP candidate.
Tim 'creepy' Kaine sucks and so do you. Anyone who is in favor of open borders can kiss my ass. MAGAZINE
It beats listening to @realDonaldTrump
Can't beat Trump, either, phonyFlake. How's it feel to be owned by Romney The Infantile, Pouty NebberTwumper? As bad as it looks?
Sen. like Jeff Flake should be voted out of office & replaced rep who understands Threat of Clinton.
we will remember your behavior
Trump is right about you. Tweeting about sunsets, football games. You're on an extended vacation, aren't you? @JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump
yeah you can. This one's at Piha, New Zealand.
Your political career is going to be a sunset in 2 years!
Amen
Vietnam veteran here , I've watched my country and corrupt leadership coming out of DC ! Time to think for Americans first !
oh, but you can.  #Winning
You are a globalist and hate America. Another corrupt politician. #AlwaysTrump
Getting the likes of u out of Rep politics would be a great sunset.  You're a Judas to R progress.
You are now in the service of the enemy and you will reap the consequences.
Nevada sunsets are just as beautiful, or more so.
....Goodbye traitor
@jbarro Have you been to CA?
Tucson

I've got a great idea for you, resign from senate so you can enjoy more of them. #progressive #AZSen #deminwaiting #SELLOUT #NRA
you are a mental giant sir! Haha
that's for sure
@gaylebass Damn.  If this wasn't from Flake, I would have "liked" this.
Any ideas yet on how you're going to help the residents of Pinal County who are going to be without health insurance in January?
After tonight's hate fest it might be time to launch the Flake 2020 website. Your party needs you now more than ever.
proof.
As a darkness settles over the nation.
almost makes you forget @realDonaldTrump is holding a nazi klan rally there
@jbarro as the sun sets on Trump's campaign.
& kickin' back after mowing the lawn
Seen any good dumpster fires lately? @JeffFlake
Time to endorse @HillaryClinton!
@Greg_Ingleright can you guys make the sunset on @realDonaldTrump please?  This is embarrassing.
Another #PureMichigan sunset
@PoliticalLine And much better than the Trump speech in AZ
Good for you for enjoying your evening! #NeverTrump
If you look close enough, you can make out #TheDonalds wall in the background.
stand up be heard. Denounce this nationalistic dangerous ass.
@PoliticalLine Arkansas sunset.
@jbarro I take it you're trying to divert attention from the horseshit we're watching on MSNBC?
Life is all about timing
And he won't be re-elected
@PoliticalLine Enjoy the sunset now. Dictator Trump will be monitoring your future viewing.

that's an everyday sunset-you need to see it in person
@jbarro touch√©
Y'all have sunsets. I'm jealous. Here in Alabama it's dark and there's a jackass on my TV.
You ppl are the haters
Sorry Jeff, as someone who has voted for you...many times...I am too busy having the shit scared out of me right now!
I beg to differ. The sunset on the Republican Party is quite the sight to behold. Why aren't you at the rally, Senator?
#fingeronthepulse
sup tonite, Jeff?
This isn't 40 years ago-Rep ideas are old tired ideology-How do you fix problems w/ ideology?
@jbarro oh I see what you did there
incredible , subtle and classy shade....
Reminds me of your career, Senator.
Wanna bet? #Utah
is that pic real life? Wow.
sailors delight.
I'm sorry he's there.
Perfect timing.
nice subtweet. 
YOU'RE A TRADER, YOUR TIME IS COMING. YOU ARE DOING NOTHING BUT HELPING HRC. REMEMBER THAT
What is Jeff trading? The word is TRAITOR. Good God, learn to spell if you're going to bitch and moan like that.
Much better than listening to Trump's speech
was this timed purposely with this awful speech?
