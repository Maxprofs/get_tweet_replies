@RedMeatMonday @realDonaldTrump
" Respect @realDonaldTrump Authority "
still isn't accepting the results! And he won!
when there were hanging chads the dems didn't accept results either. Need to know the circumstances first
what's really beyond pale is your elitist disdain for ur constituents &ur hypocrisy #animalabuse #draintheswamp
Your constituents feel the same way about you and your failure to support our party's candidate.
He's one of the few with any self respect. You take Trump. He's the worst candidate in history.
Then go vote for Hillary, and don't bitch about the results. I couldn't stand Romney, but I voted for him.
What will Hillary do that's so terribly wrong? Too liberal?
The same thing that has led to the greatest income gap in 74 years.  She is owned by Wall St.
so why aren't you condemning @TheDemocrats Hissyfit @CNN @MSNBC are Racebaiting !
TYPICAL @JeffFlake HEARING PROBLEM - ALL TALK NO ACTION - just a  John McCain (Want to be) - Flake the Snake
You @JeffFlake weren't picked by the people. We chose @realDonaldTrump for a reason. Only #Trump would stand up to the many s
pretending that that's what Trump was really saying is right out of Hillary play book. Good job senator. Jesus!
Have you seen the voting systems fraud?
Senator Flake, I'm a Democrat who rarely agrees with your position, however, I have the utmost respect for you.

WHERE'S  NOW?? SELECTIVE OUTRAGE A PERSON WOULD THINK TRUMP COMMITTED A CRIMINAL WORTHY OF THE GALLOWS.
Anything to say about the machines changing ballots or the people voting multiple times? We did'nt think so
have you not seen the O'Keefe videos? It is proof of widespread fraud:
have u not read o'keefes BACKGROUND & HISTORY? He's been convicted of video editing, again, EDUCATE
@TrumpNoFilter @realDonaldTrump Is he saying that again?
get your head out of the sand Jeff flake
You mean like @algore in 2000? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_v._Gore …
Gore called & conceded...it was an AUTOMATICS recount...read ur history...ACTUAL history
Not if it's obviously been rampant with fraud!! Would you?
Is Flake getting ready for the flip to Dem? I smell a rat. He is similar to typical Tucson City politicians.
Rush Limbaugh agreed with Trump. You are total establishment sellout.
That is why America loves him. He is above tired platitudes like "beyond the pale"
You're an A**  Flake! RINO
the only reason your not running is Arizona already told you your fired now resign clear out your desk and let Ward complete the term.
you wont be complicit with Trump in saving America but you sure complicit working with the dems to destroy it you've never been a good human
why don't u just shut your mouth! Do u want HRC filling the court, support the nominee!
is a great representative.  No reason for him to shut his mouth
Right, like Gore in 2000.
@TrumpNoFilter @realDonaldTrump If he feels that way then he shouldn't participate. He's just covering his BIG ass.
You are trash Flake.
Based on CLEAR corruption from Potus down brings EVERYTHING into doubt.. Impossible is now clearly possible.
Wrong! It's valid!Time to be ?'d when dead ppl vote& vote 1 party>end result is opposing party! 'We' want it ?'d
Not backing your party's candidate is beyond the pale. You are nothing but an establishment sell out.
He will go down in History as a big Buffoon who lost everything.
We have a betting pool going as how Trump will fake his death.
We already know the elections are rigged. Are you serious.
Myth of voter fraud from non partisan Brennan center http://linkis.com/brennancenter.org/Zn09n …
so those videos where Scott foval and others admit to voter fraud didn't happen?
felon paid by trump foundation to make false videos
Hillary paid people to sabotage Trump rallies.
really you have any proof any cites at all 4 this info??
http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-foundation-paid-activist-filmmaker-james-o-keefe-n670381 … my God, do you trumpers have any ability2research
Thank you for this article will share and share
so Gore shouldn't have disputed his election?
Dems want us to accept their stolen elections. It's as simple as that.
dealing with the....how shall I say this....gullible....part of America is extremely difficult...EDUCATE
After 32 loyal years, I am done with the GOP.  They always eat their own, tired of it.
Gore challenged the election results.  Your ignorance is beyond pale.
Ty
@WalterZaykowski @realDonaldTrump 
Gore sis not accept results. He sued
doesn't make it right. Was also a recount situation, to dismiss results offhand is wrong.
Did not dismiss offhand--would look at when come in. Conway says he will accept when he wins
You need to think hard about how you and the #GOP will handle this nightmare, senator. Your party nominated him.
physician heal thyself LMAO #emailscandal #Haiti #RussianUranium #sixbillion #wikileaks #quidproquo @JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump
Hillary doesn't have to be "handled," since the media is all in for her!
the same way @algore accepted results? Or @HillaryClinton when Bush won? You are #Dem just admit it
doesn't get it!  There is proof that there has ben voter fraud & manipulation!@realDonaldTrump is spot on about double checking!
No Flake you're beyond the pale, it was the people not the elite that nominated Mr Trump. Go against him you're going against us!
why should he when there's evidence of voter fraud? You must be part of the never Trump crowd. Sad
Because we are all supposed to accepts whatever lies Clinton feeds us. R We supposed to accept Comey or Koskinen
20%US uranium to Putin's Russia-$145 million in Clinton Foundation. Why are you letting her get away with this?
Most Arizona ppl not ur friend Flake! I'm one of them. You & @SenJohnMcCain suck! Mr. Trump, don't trust them!!!
u know u guys r ridiculous have u sold your soul that cheap?
Dems do it all the time. Why don't u switch parties?  Dumocrat fits ur mouth.
Remember 2000?phony! Gore changed his mind and contested! He has every right to wait! And your pathetic!
you're sick that this is more troubling to you than the thousands of crimes committed by Clinton!
Proof elections R rigged R out there. Americans R not blind. Stand up & support Trump or corruption Hillary wins
You're beyond the pale. Pseudoconservative. U sacrifice the SCOTUS & USA 2 prove a pt or keep establishment.
Typical GOPe shill no cojones! So if your opponent is clearly committing voter fraud, you just cower & accept?
this guy who is not what Americans want in congress anymore needs to be voted out!Lets ensure that for USA!
youre a joke!With all the proven voter fraud exposed last two days alone,why would he?AlGore simply rejected!
You are a traitor to the Republican Party and obviously don't care about the constitution supporting HRC. She is a criminal!
like Al Gore?
because he would be the first to do it? Crawl back in your hole. You're finished.
Al Gore. Or am I the only one who remembers?
@AlGoreReport but it was ok for Gore when the election fraud was in his favor; many Republicans prevented from voting then!
Seriously Senator?
Didn't @algore take the 2000 election to the #Scotus?
Really Jeff remember Al Gore  have u watched #Project VERITAS  read any of the  #podesta emails  your pathetic
This is not what he said. He has the right to contest the results. The system is rigged! Are you a Hillbot?
Stop worrying what Trump is doing. And be a better parent. Your son a reflection of you?
@MarieMa49685063 @JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump His last name says it all. Never has there been a more fitting moniker.
Agree. Flake must be a horriable Father. His kid is outrageous and dangerous
You know Mr. Flake, you should get over yourself and think beyond your small little place in AZ.  Help USA-Trump
Flake your son on Twitter. Maybe you should be a better parent.
You suck Jeff
no it isnt Jeff. But the fact that you r no longer representing we the people is certainly beyond pale.
HE DID NOT SAY THAT.try listeningsometimes instead believingMSM @DonaldJTrumpJr @KellyannePolls @StefanMolyneux
I think you fighting for the DC and Democrat Criminal Machine is just great! Keep it up!!!
your refusal to see the clear fraud is beyond the pale!

lol Al Gore 2000 is all I gotta say
How is it beyond the pale, have you not seen all of the proof that the elections are rigged?Why not support us?
stop crying... the old order is about to go... see ya....
traitor flake we will vote you out watch 
beyond the pale...so u deny the the overwhelming evidence that exist and keeps coming out?WHY WOULD THAT BE?
Americans have the duty & responsibility to keep politicians like you &  our elections fair & honest.
but Al gore doing it is totally cool.
Flake you are clearly a loser! Shameful!  TRUMP 
That just shows how naive or sold out YOU are if you cannot accept the fact the government establishment is #Corrupt #Trump2016
lake @JamesGoodnow @realDonaldTrump
Both Flake and McCain need to leave the Republican Party.  I'm voting John out in November and Trump for Prez!
The pale is what got us here.
We'll elect Trump.
How about you get off Twitter & get your own house in order and stop bashing the GOP candidate.
Once again you have an appropriate last name. FLAKE. How stupid can you be!!!!!!! Gore? Kerry? Nixon?
Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state. Are you okay with that?
More than 1.8 million dead people are still registered to vote. You are okay with that?
Just like Al Gore!
yawn, is flake talking again???
Just like in 2000. What have you never heard of a candidate questioning the results? Have you been under a rock?
You not supporting a Pro-Life, secure borders, defeating ISIS, lower taxes is more than beyond the pale-TRAITOR
Yeah, Gore and Bush were such traitors.
Every statement u make attacking Trump is beyond the pale. I will never vote 4 another Mormon politician again
It's a little like saying, "If elected I may decide not to serve. We'll see how I feel after the election."
Jeff your last name fits you.
.@JeffFlake Refusing to give Merrick Garland the vote he deserves as a SCOTUS nominee (after 200+ days) is also beyond the pale. Shameful.
@RyanLizza @realDonaldTrump Al Gore contesting the 2000 election is an "Inconvenient Truth"
as opposed to everything else that he said which is within the pale
unless of course it's DRUMROLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL THE DONALD, greatest man on Earth
but absolutely typical.
What is beyond the pale is you elected officials constantly bashing the "Party's Nominee"!
Why haven't Ryan, McConnell and others denounced Trump? Do they have no regard for the rule of law either? Frightening.
For a guy that doesn't like the media, Trump sure makes sure he stays in it 24/7.
he is beyond the pale that is why he paints his face orange, hoping it's a halloween costume
But it's Okay that Dems have said it for years? We should just accept that they cheat? What's wrong with you?
u must be just another RINO sucking off the HRC teet, unbelievable that you wont support DJT or the fact #voterfraud is rampant
relative to the rest of the information the voters have this is just SNAFU.

#NeverClump
yOU REALLY ARE A fLAKE
It is 100% honest. Dems did NOT accept the Bush/Gore what's the diff? Oh BC a Repub said it?
If Trump's words are beyond the pale, what do you call this?
Undercover video: Hillary campaign plotted to start violence at Trump rallies. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IuJGHuIkzY …
Jeff Flake is a disgrace.
He is the head of your party. You should resign now. @RoseyDavis1 @realDonaldTrump  #StrongerTogether
#Understatement
he has a right to question any result that is not honest.   You lost my vote on next senate race.
@Dem4Hillary @realDonaldTrump Yet somehow not unexpected.....
@KLM_blessed @realDonaldTrump not if deception is involved
He doesn't have to accept the results, but he must abide by them. #MakeMineMcmullin
to those comparing Trump to Gore, a razor thin ONE COUNTY difference should be recounted.... 8-12% (if lucky) should not.
#CrookedHeffFlake #FakeConservative, WE will win and WE are draining the swamp.
@mikepencevp What hve all thse Americans since Lexington died? So you can refuse 2 accept the USA elec. results?
Do accept every thing sight unseen? I would hope not. 
I'm with Trump who is the real man of the people!
Senator Flake, you are likely a republican that I would support if I lived in Arizona. Thank you for your courage and integrity.
on @MeetThePress @chucktodd Good intv. Flake has great leadership potential. Might want to work on his charisma...
Excellent job on @MSNBC Thank you for saying what needed to be said. And I'm an #Arizona #Democrat You have major #integrity
Good for you @JeffFlake! @realDonaldTrump is not worthy of the Presidency. Dangerous,incompetent,racist,selfish,foolish,sexist,predator.
@PhoenixWomanMN @realDonaldTrump 

Jeff Flake, you are a flake.
wow just heard you on meet the press. You're so sensible and reasonable. Please run for prez 2020
you should run for president at some point
Senator, you're a really decent person.  Wish we had 50 more of you in the US Senate!
it's not @realDonaldTrump it's us! He is our voice. We know it's corrupt and you're fighting the wrong cause. Stand down Flake
did you get permission from your handlers before posting this. I cannot wait to vote you out of office.
Senator Jeff has had a sudden epiphany now that he sees Trump may drag him down with him.
Right up there with "17 US intelligence agencies". Did that include the EPA?
You not supporting trump means you're supporting Hillary, that sir is beyond the pale
~ You know Jeff I don't like you and not because of Trump. You make me want to wash my hands.
Decorate with garland? Better hurry ass hats. More liberal judges coming.
STFU and come out of the closet already. Everyone knows you're a Democrat. Stop hiding.
Jeff, zip your pants. Your mangina is hanging out.
So, Flake endorses vote fraud and will accept all levels of it? That is  despicable.
So you don't actually believe that Russia is tampering with US elections then?
Some old GOP is refreshing once in awhile. Don't agree with your politics, but admire your integrity, service.
is it so different from not addressing Obama's Supreme Court nominee?
Really the reason we are in the mess we are in is because of following traditions instead of using our minds.
Just what we need, another pearl clutching republican to weigh in.
YOU ARE A TRAITOR
Jeff, stop worrying about losing your power and start worrying about losing the country!
Perfect name for you 'Flake'.  Project Veritas videos prove Voter Fraud and recent Indiana Fraud.  RINO
Beyond the pale? Really? Of course, your behavior by not sticking up for the guy we nominated was beyond stupid.
What the Hell is wrong with your party that you put this fascist on your presidential ticket??????????????????????????????
Saying he would takes away any legitimate right to challenge.  He gets it.   Why don't you
The American people must reject ALL Republicans, be a patriot,vote Dems @JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump
guess your name says it all Flake support Trump or get out. Not supporting him is supporting the devil, Killary
......... trump did not say that.........
fuck this guy ! Just trying to get attention!
