You must be pro Banker/Wallstreet and TPP then. Progressives are now walking away. @jaketapper @timkaine
he left he republican party a long time ago. No he is just a R.A.T. that wants to darken my kid's future.
Clinton is a terrible human being who destroys everything she touches. Look what she did to libya syria Haiti. She cannot win
libya is know under isis control. How is that better? Are you just uninformed or delusional?
Kaine is a Progressive Marxist, anti-constitutionalist- NOT a good person neither is HRC: http://hillarythemovie.com/trailer.html 
@davidlehmann09 @JeffFlake @timkaine he's a "catholic" who is pro abortion and pro gay marriage?? Doesn't sound Catholic 2 me
Pelosi, Biden and many others who support gay marriage and abortion are Catholics also.
there also Democrats??? huh
You use to be able to go to http://Congress.org  i think and look up their religions.
sounds like something the Republicans did???
And you are not a TRUE Republican, you are just like McCain Graham all PROGRESSIVES. #WakeUpAmerica!
I thought the word "progressive" is a positive word! What's wrong with it?
No it means govt control like keep you dependent on them..
I definitely would not trust u with a definition.
I personally would not trust u with researching for facts or history-Very sad-GoODBYe! ○ツ°
hahahahaah. You're petty, aren't you?
really
nice to see a mensch on the other side of the aisle. Well done, senator flake.
Whatever
Change parties already.
Has your kid killed anymore dogs lately
@JeffFlake  I hear you're on ur way out according to polls. Thx for serving! "Yourself"
Flake consistently an ass
can't bring himself to hate @timkaine's position on aborting babies. What a FLAKE!
creepy timmy...now he's a real cuck!!
Heres one: When Kaines wife said she wanted other LOVERS, Tim had to understand she was 'embracing herself' . #Idiotic.
your name fits you flake !
@jeanee5TAM @timkaine  Jeff- your high school yearbook called. They want your senior pic/avi back...
he has the worst case of pedophile face in recorded history
.@JeffFlake, it’s because you're both liberals who voted to fund Obamacare, amnesty, and Planned Parenthood.
when is Jeff Flake running for reelection?

He's a fake and fraud and we need to make this our mission to primary him out.
@lauracgilleslil @SCF @JeffFlake I'm pretty sure he is a Democrat. #TrumpPence16
keep blowing him jeffy
Blank maybe your natural state.
Obviously not one of @realDonaldTrump's New Republican Movement. @realDonaldTrump finally someone we can trust. #AZ #CA
Sen Flake is obviously not in the Trump New Republican Movement. #Arizona wants a wall Flake.
You will suffer because Progs will vote for Jill Stein
Jill who?
Green Party candidate. Aka the truly progressive party.
Does she have a shot yo win?
Implying Stein voters would've voted for Clinton at all
The good news is this is the most progressive ticket/platform ever.
Jeff God knew what he was doing when you were born a FLAKE
<He Backed the #Gangof8 No wonder he likes Kaine so much, same goal> #HRCOpenBorders #WakeUpAmerica @EricTrump @YoungDems4Trump
Please stop lying 2 all the voters of AZ and change your party to D
Yeah probably sucking TIM'S tiny KANDY KAINE! Some things to help you REMEMBER! POS TRAITOR!
why is Flake a Flake Republican?
Very gracious. Well done.
Time to vote you out too jeff!
Clinton and Kaine are Republicans in sheep clothing
Tim Kaine is a crook also. He took gifts and money which was illegal. But that's what kind of people we get in office,
Here this might help you. http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/tim-kaine-virginia-veep-mcdonnell-clinton-224888 … Kaine is as corrupt as Hitlery Rotten
One democrat supporting another democrat
Other than he is thief and like u uses us tax payers for Ur personal gain.Why is Tucson a sanctuary city? 48 in educ.
It is so obvious that you care nothing about the people who elected you and are simply hoping to stay in DC
If you want to be a democrat @JeffFlake @timkaine next time you run for office, please don't pretend 2 be a Republican/tea party member thxs
And yet ANOTHER endorsement for a candidate on the LEFT, AZ!  WAKE THE HELL UP ABOUT THIS FOOL.
It isnt about hating @timkaine. This isn't Kindergarten. Its about disagreeing with his policies, his corruption and smugness.
are you crazy?????   Not the Tim Kaine I know.  You must be kidding
can't wait till you run for re-election. You are going to get CRUSHED!!!
He's a winner for sure.
This is the kind of leadership and maturity our country needs! Thank you Jeff.
this tweet makes me optimistic. We can't demonize those we disagree with.  There are good people are on both sides.
Folks this asshole from AZ is a TRUMP hater. He pretends2b a devoured MORMON Is that a cult? I saw Jeff Warren arrested there
@HillaryClinton @timkaine trying to find the ways i dislike trump ran out or paper ink pens pensils and memory on my phone and pc
#RESIGN! Embarrassment to Arizonans!!!! You will not keep that seat long, you're not a true republican! #FRAUD
Flake are you a democrat in disguise or what? @realDonaldTrump is 100% better than Kaine.
just another POS.  Man the citizens need to clean house. Start with this shitpile!
you should change parties & vote 4Hillary. You are a hypocrite! Can't play both sides for votes Senator. @FoxNews
@realDonaldTrump Everything u said about Trump 2 Megyn 2night was lies.
Trump didn't say he couldn't respect McCain because he got captured.
He said "He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured." nothing wrong with that
& Just pointed out that 1 w/Mex.  heritage might b biased against 1 who calls 4 building border wall; not racist
cuz you need to grow a pair, you need to convert, U R a RINO, weak, easily offended, really, grow a pair U sound gay
ex Military! Hate is a strong word to use & you are worried about "Lock her Up"!https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act …
And this right here ~ 'hate?' Come on ~ how about dislike.
yeah I hear he's part of the Muslim Brotherhood. Figured you'd stand up for him
Food for thought. With 14 other candidates on the AZ primary ballot, Trump won the state with 46% of the vote.
Why don't you switch to the party you support? Both AZ senators skipping RNC convention inexcusable!
wow, that looked like it was gonna b scary! Like him too. Just wish he was from another great KC School : Bishop Ward!
Your toast come reelection time. How did you ever get elected? Our transplanted conservatives to Az can't wait to vote.
Jeff should announce anytime now his switch to be a Democrat.
Yeah!  He believes in TPP; is a darling of Wall Street; and took $160k in gifts while a governor!  Love him!
You know @JeffFlake, if you can't help us win this election, then just keep your mouth shut.  Or change party.
He can add this shame for supporting HRC she laughs https://www.facebook.com/westernjournalismvideo/videos/713811555388800/ …
wow. What a waste you are. You, Cruz, Kasich, and Romney only care about yourselves.  Hold your nose and vote Trump.
Jeff is a flake.
Mr. Flake.....tweets & actions like these are why I am going to enjoy seeing you lose when U are up for re-election.
Nice senator from my state Arizona.. Thanks 4 the great tweet!!
Thank you, Senator, for your honesty and courage.
@HillaryClinton @timkaine He will lose big with the criminal Clintons!
Hate, Senator Flake? 
Is it any wonder, why people are so disillusioned? Troubling that you "hate" anyone. Shameful
Glad to see some politicians haven't forgotten civility, courtesy, & bipartisanship. Hope your lawn is doing well.
@SarahPalinUSA please run for Senator of Arizona and get this idiot out of office
WOW!  Thanks for not bashing Tim Kaine as expected. You make me hopeful that Repub. and Dems. can work together.
Flake, Kaine = 2 do nothing politicians.
pulls a John Kerry can't impose my reg beliefs on others way to throw your catholic faith in the trash, sad
It's ok to have different POV but thank you for having the courage 2 stand up for what's right!! #NeverTrump
I'm having a hard time not liking you now. Not in GOP playbook I guess but thanks.
#Turncoat You should have been left on that island with the Democrat Senator! #IdiotTraitor #GangOfEight
@WillieGeist @timkaine Here is 1...
.@JeffFlake @timkaine You don't have to canonize him I don't hate anybody but Kaine is a hypocrite on more than one Democrat Party position!
@WillieGeist @timkaine Let me help you: calling to deregulate banks, pro TPP, not against Abusive Payday Lending practices.
another neocon Flake globalist.  You will be purged next election buddy.
Don't forget he's fluent in Spanish, his most impressive quality according to the media!
Sunday Haiku. 
Senator Jeff Flake 
Seems like a rational guy.
Time to turn him Blue.
@DaveSFoley @timkaine  Kaine is a good man. He's not progressive enough 4 me but I'd vote 4 him if Hillary didn't belong in jail.
Islamic ties-big bank money-your kind of guy!
y is gop so upset he speaks Spanish. Doesn't look the part?
@FearOfaBlackRep @timkaine May R's across the country invest in @JeffFlake 's defeat.
Glad you see beyond a political party. You may have a chance at my vote in a few years.
Time for you to go back to a deserted island...and stay there.
Hey Jeff, here's wishing you a short term as a politician, because if you can't see Tim's corruption, you are complicit
ARIZONA GET RID OF THIS TRAITOR!  HE'S DONE GREAT DAMAGE 2 OUT COUNTRY! @JeffFlake http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/07/republican-name-senator-jeff-flake-supports-hillarys-vp-pick-hates-trump/ … #trumptrain
@JimStLeger @timkaine Well said Senator. I'm proud of my counterpart in DC.
How about his support for murdering innocents in the womb??
Nice.
this tweet shows how despicable you are! How could you betray your party & country. You are modern judas. You will be cantored!
the Kaine and Unable team.
thank you, Senator, for eschewing the vile wormhole that passes for political discourse lately.
Love the person disagree with methods. Kudos to Jeff Flake.
I can't wait until you run for office again so I can volunteer to help who runs against you!
You will be sorry for endorsing the democratic VP pick, he supports Abortion!!   I am campaigning to vote you OUT!!
u r now my favorite republican
yuk
I am a union president with very different political views but I sincerely appreciate your civility. Your a good man.
I am proud Democrat and must say Sen. Flake's tweet is a rare act of class during this election season.  Very American
Sen Flake you are a complete phony, "endorsing" your good friend.Glad you have shown your true colors
You're a good man @JeffFlake, and a good Republican. You and Grant Woods: respected by this Progressive Democrat.
Thank you, Senator Flake. Gives me hope that everything in this political world of our doesn't have to be B/W.
really, tell that to the people of Appomattox, oh and his wife destroying education in Va.
@mhoptman @timkaine Yea,yea whatever! Kaine IS a good man.ButYOU support an evil disgusting racist! How do you live with urself?
Thank you for being honest. One of the few Republicans to stand up to Trump!
you are the biggest loser in Arizona. I will work hard to see you defeated.
#lifelong dem here. Az resident. Love your stance of late. Your a class act. 
But what does @SenJohnMcCain think?has @brahmresnik asked?  
@JeffFlake
@Montel_Williams @timkaine Flake, as a Dem, you've been growing on my lately with your statements
From AZ-Not a fan AZ Republicans,  but have to hand it to @JeffFlake for his response to  @timkaine.  And non-support for @realDonaldTrump
As an AZ Democrat, thank you for being decent instead of political. It's time for the bombastic name-calling to end.
thank you.
Much respect for you taking the high road on this, Senator.  Including your feelings about Trump.
@Montel_Williams @timkaine SO YOU DONOT MIND KRIMINAL KAINE DEREGULATING BIG BANKS?WELL GOOD MY FATHER IS A BANK OWNER THIS ISBAD
Hats off to you. Decency is appreciated.
@Montel_Williams @timkaine FIRST THING HE WANTS TO DO ACCORDING TO A NEWS INTERVIEW IS TO DEREGULATE BIG BANKS! BAD FOR USA!
THESE CRIMES TRUMP ANYTHING HE HAS BRAGGED ABOUT DOING. VOLUNTEERING IS A BLESSING NOT A VP REQUIRMENT
We could use more of this in public life.
Am I missing something or are Clinton/Kaine actually Republicans?
I know i don't agree on policy with you, but I do respect you being one of the few professionals in Congress. Thank you
so nice of you to offer your kind words.
“@JeffFlake: Trying to count the ways I hate @timkaine. Drawing a blank. Congrats to a good man and a good friend.” Two good and kind men.
said similar things about @mike_pence now what team you on the democrats ?? #dnc2016 #dnc2016 #wikileak #CorruptDNC
And yet your gonna stick with the unqualified racist for president?  You can do better, Mr. Flake.
shocking coming from a loser RINO. Why not worry about sealing the border than praising the dem opposition?
@HillaryClinton @timkaine Here, let me help you.  1. He hangs with Hillary.  2.  He hangs with Hillary,3. Same as 1 and 2. Help?
a good man who champions the slaughter of the unborn? Just switch parties and drop the pretense.
Very classy.
next time I vote Jeff will be against you
anyone who speaks Spanish in his first sentence as VP cand is a complete fraud & frankly, disgusting. I loathe him.
. hopefully you're voted out soon. You are part of the reason the democrats/socialists win. shame on you.
So sad. I thought you were supposed to stand for our nation's values. No surprise #RINOFlake, you are just a sellout.
 #TrumpPence16 #MAGA #DNCLeaks #WomenForTrump #CrookedHillary #NeverHillary
crawl back under your rock Flake. Good grief so pathetic.
Really? You're time is up...time for you to actually work for a living...Hillsry is a crook. Period. @JeffFlake @timkaine
2018 is close can't wait to primary this ass
Thank you
who will primary this traitor
really? Amid the Iran Deal, TPP, and embracing HRC as President. Wow.
I have never voted for a Republican. If you keep this up, you may be the first.
Jeff Flake is bought and paid for like a Starbucks gift card.
All hail the 'Unity Party' where friends 'owe' friends!
great guy who just loves hamas and muslim brotherhood!Corrupt pols just dont get it: USA FIRST!
http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/07/23/clinton-vp-pick-tim-kaines-islamist-ties/ …
just wondering when you announce your official switch to the party of big govt control
-- Cuck.
@bugg_ray @timkaine it's easy, to infinity and beyond!
Jeff Flake, you just scored 100,000 integrity points from this liberal....
ur a flake. just keep ur mouth shut say nothing But I'm sure u have something vile 2 say about Cruz right? He is the bad guy?
tweets like the one from @JeffFlake to @timkaine make me feel way better about the USA's future. Compromise + thinking > anger
Life long Dem but you are the type of Repub my parents voted 4 back in the day.  Classy of you to disavow the hate.
Respect your words of friendship. Wish more (R)s were like you!
I promise today to donate money to whoever runs against you!
I promise to donate money to both @JeffFlake @timkaine

sad to see your feed
I will fix that and block you since I don't want you to be sad.
