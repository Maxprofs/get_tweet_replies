@JeffFlake @2LStrikeForce strong my ass Moron!! Sellout little bitch!
@JeffFlake Any amnesty is a serious threat to national security. There is no way to do thorough background checks on 11-20 MILLION illegals.
@JeffFlake Please estimate how many dozens of illegal aliens will vote for @GOP if you bestow amnesty and citizenship on 12 million of them.
@JeffFlake LOL...we're not buying what your selling. #Crapsandwich
@JeffFlake @2LStrikeForce 
Thanks senator for yet another pork filled bill.
@JeffFlake @2LStrikeForce 
Thanks for another pork filled bill to put us further in debt,,just what we need now
@JeffFlake 11-15 million getting amnesty before border security is implemented?  That's a LOSS for Arizona.
.@JeffFlake If that's a strong bill, you're the senior senator from AZ who can do anything and still count on re-election.
Your #GangOf8 is Massive Incentive to Hire Newly Legalized Illegals Over Legals - and REPLACE Legals ..Shame on You @JeffFlake
@RubyBelvin @JeffFlake The traditional red state of AZ is about to recall BOTH their GOP senators! You can't diss the electorate!
That is good to know. I hear DC is a city filled with temptation & easy corruption #NOAmnesty @batesjoe @JeffFlake
.@JeffFlake @a3auntie Bad day for our country.
@JeffFlake If you were shooting for "unintentionally funny," you hit your target. #GoodDayForAZ
@JeffFlake you're a tool!
@JeffFlake Are you kidding me?  The worst day for AZ.  Did you read the bill? Really surprised you have switched sides.You & @SenJohnMcCain
@JeffFlake  Senator Flake I think S 744 is garbage and you and Senator McCain have sold out to the cheap labor lobby. No amnesty
@JeffFlake PLease explain how 'immigration reform" will help AZ?
@JeffFlake Another reason you should be recalled!!!
@sedonaduck @JeffFlake we need her rid of this racist who is helping #latinos in #immigrationreform #throwRinos2014 http://po.st/yFU6YP 
@JeffFlake A strong 68-32 vote AGAINST American Soverignty!  #RegretMyVote
@JeffFlake Incentives for employers to hire amnestied "immigrants" over US Citizens - LOSS for Arizona http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/68-senators-vote-create-incentive-employers-hire-amnestied-immigrants-over-us-citizens_738015.html … #tcot #tbrs
Thank you, @JeffFlake for leading on CIR.
@JeffFlake that was a terrible bill and you should be ashamed and voted out of office.
@JeffFlake Flake is the perfect name for a loser like you, good job in sucking up to @SenJohnMcCain @marcorubio @LindseyGrahamSC. #sellout
@JeffFlake   We are a great nation because we are a nation of laws.   YOUR GANG BILL MAKES LAW BREAKING THE FOUNDATION.
@JeffFlake #RecallFlake http://senatorflake.com/recall-petition/ …
@JeffFlake No it's not a good thing.  Legal immigrants don't deserve this, nor do American taxpayers.  We need jobs Senator not bigger gov't
@JeffFlake And it will die in the House....as it should.
@JeffFlake @2LStrikeForce PATHETIC
@JeffFlake @2LStrikeForce Bad day for USA! You just voted Yea to lawbreakers, fewer jobs, increased welfare, PORK & special interest payoffs
Legal Immigrants have followed the law and waited years, this action was as if you spit on them.. @JeffFlake  #NOAmnesty
@JeffFlake Just sold America to Foreigners 4 VOTES= BAD DAY 4 CITIZENS.
@JeffFlake I'm extremely disappointed that you'd sell us out. Border security is a fallacy when Napolitano has waiver power?
@JeffFlake must be strong given all that proported strength.  Xtra burly.
@JeffFlake Whatever recall efforts against you I will support financially as much as I can. Senate will be better off without a Rino traitor
@JeffFlake Fell for it did ya. Tell me sir how many pages did you actually read? Disappointed, thought you would rep AZ better. Silly me
“@JeffFlake: Just passed strong #immigrationreform bill out of the Senate with a strong 68-32 vote.  Good day for AZ.” You sold us all out
@jsinacore007 @JeffFlake it's not a good day you #flaked on all of us..the amer. lwr class won't be able to compete bec no ocare-tax immigs
@JeffFlake According to CBO report, UR bill will depress wages for at least a decade.  WHY on earth would you vote for something like that?
@JeffFlake According to CBO report, UR bill will increase the unemployment rate.  Why would you vote for that?  #STUPID #IDIOTIC #ASININE
@JeffFlake According to CBO report, ur bill reduces illegal immigration by only 25%.  1986 part 2.  Why would you vote for that? #FAIL
@JeffFlake, thank you for your principled leadership on the #immigration issue! #tcot
@JeffFlake You are F.O.S. NO AMNESTY, SECURE THE BORDER. I will not vote for you or McCain EVER again!!!
@JeffFlake you obviously did not read the bill!!!!!! You are nothing more than a traitor!
@JeffFlake I'll believe it when I see a difference, until then, it's all hot air.
Thank u Sen @JeffFlake 4 working so hard since the beginning! Please help us put pressure on the House to make #immigrationReform a reality!
@JeffFlake Bad for you when your re-election is up... #RINO
@JeffFlake thank Senator for your courage in doing right ...
@JeffFlake You're finished in az. Jerk!
Thank you, Senator @JeffFlake for your leadership on immigration reform.
@JeffFlake hoping that Hispanics flock to Rs because of ur asinine vote is akin to thinking our enemies will like us if we talk to them.
@JeffFlake BAD day for ZA. Bad day for the middle class. You got played by the Ds and you sold out. #PATHETIC #DESPICABLE
@JeffFlake Strong with stench of pork and favors. Strong with stench of ignoring the will of American public.
@JeffFlake Horrible for Arizona and the country. No amnesty.  Will NOT vote for you next election, guaranteed.
@JeffFlake You're really nuts.  That was not good for #AZ.....not another dime for you.
@JeffFlake DOA WHEN IT GETS 2 H0USE SMARTER HSE LEADERS SENATE democRATS R JUST A BUNCH OF DUMB ASS LOSERS AND CAN'T B TRUSTED WEAK GOP'S 2
@JeffFlake We do NOT have a Judeo Christian country and "all americans" are not xtian,  40% are not. We dont need a "pastor in chief" Rubio.
@JeffFlake I HOPE YOU GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF MCCAIN'S ASS SOON. HE'S GOING TO MAKE YOU VERY UNPOPULAR LIKE HE IS
“@JeffFlake: Just passed strong #immigrationreform bill out of the Senate with a strong 68-32 vote.  Good day for AZ.” / [white] Arizona
RT @jeffflake: Just passed strong #immigrationreform bill out of the Senate with a strong 68-32 vote.  Good day for AZ.
@JeffFlake no ask your law enforcement officials !! You didn't do your own research and depended on climbing the ladder by following McCain
@JeffFlake You suck Jeff. Way to follow your daddy @SenJohnMcCain and stab the people that elected you in the back. #weakimmigrationreform
@JeffFlake Senate just passed strong amnesty bill which is bad for Arizona. #NoAmmesty
@JeffFlake ,since you are now voting with progressives, what's the next step to destroy AZ and our country? #noamensty
“@JeffFlake: Just passed strong #immigrationreform bill out of the Senate with a strong 68-32 vote.  Good day for AZ.”
@JeffFlake #idiot that bill has so much pork in it it smells like bacon. Sad day for working Americans, get ready to carry the burden
@JeffFlake http://senatorflake.com/recall-petition/ …
@JeffFlake you have just lost my vote. I don't mind the vote. I do mind the lie of what this Bill is. Shame on you.
“@JeffFlake: Just passed strong #immigrationreform bill out of the Senate with a strong 68-32 vote.  Good day for AZ.”
@JeffFlake BAD day for #AZ and BAD day for you! BAD day for #America! HOW #SAD.
@JeffFlake Disagree. Actually a dark day for AZ and the USA. Too bad you could not do the right thing. Let's pray House has better judgment.
“@JeffFlake: Just passed strong #immigrationreform bill out of the Senate with a strong 68-32 vote.  Good day for AZ.”  Your vote was wrong.
@JeffFlake Your just got primaried on next election..  You will be a one term senator and for nothing.. House will not bring it up.
@JeffFlake shame on you
@JeffFlake Thank you!!!!!!!
I OPPOSE #Path2Citizenship 4 #IllegalImmigrants! I SUPPORT #Path2LegalResidency-IF taxes, fines & community service r rendered! @JeffFlake
@JeffFlake Thank you for helping to pass this important Bill.
