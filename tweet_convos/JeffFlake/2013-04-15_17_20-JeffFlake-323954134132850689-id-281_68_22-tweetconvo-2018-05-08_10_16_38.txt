@JeffFlake Good to hear. No new #guncontrol.
@ChrisKnox_AZ @JeffFlake So you opposed helping to keep people safe from lunatics who get guns?  MY GOD.  Have you no conscience?
@SueHM @chrisknox_az @jeffflake that easy answer is NO! He has no conscience or morals
@covertanjou @SueHM @JeffFlake Nothing in that bill would stop Sandy Hook, Tucson, Aurora. Smugness parading as morality won't change that.
@ChrisKnox_AZ You make money promoting guns, so spare me your smugness parading as morality over those who want to prevent murder.
@sophiatwrites I make money? I wish! Wanting to prevent not the same as preventing murder. My mother's gun may have prevented a murder.
@ChrisKnox_AZ I'm sorry about any tragedy that may have befallen your family. Yet I don't see how background checks on guns are a bad thing.
@sophiatwrites Bad guy left because Mom had a gun. Success! BG check harder it sounds. Read the bill. H.L. Mencken

@JeffFlake you're a piece of shit. Love that lobby money MMMMmmmm.
@JeffFlake By your vote on gun control I am convinced that we must get corp money out of politics
@JeffFlake These were common sense measures. I'm not sure who is more of a coward, the shooters or the people who empower them?
@JeffFlake You are horrid and should be ashamed of yourself.
@JeffFlake RT @SenTedCruz: The goal of the background check legislation is a national gun registry http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-TV/2013/04/11/Sen-Ted-Cruz-Goal-of-Universal-Background-Checks-is-a-Federal-List-of-Every-Gun-Owner-in-America … It must be stopped
@WashingtonDCTea @JeffFlake @SenTedCruz  The bill clearly stated no registry. Lying to yourselves, others or both?
@JeffFlake Well, thanks to you and your master the NRA, criminals are safer. You don't deserve your friends.
@JeffFlake.Thanks for the no vote and to hell with your fly boy buddy.
@JeffFlake Thank you for defending the #2A. Constitutional rights are worth fighting for. #teaparty
@JeffFlake no excuse to not have background check
@JeffFlake So you changed your little mind.  no heavy lifting
@JeffFlake Gov.Perry to @MarcoRubio: Stand up and condemn immigration bill and step away from it as far as you can..

Your Face is one of them, Senator

Shame on you
@JeffFlake there's no need for background checks on gun shows or to ban certain guns & mags! We have rights as responsible Americans!
@JeffFlake lazy coward #nrawhore show some spine
@JeffFlake Opposing it is letting down the families, the victims and YOUR CONSTITUENCY who want change! Tucsonans have felt the pain already
@JeffFlake you should shred #letterman the liberal idiot for tonight. Like others, he has no clue what all the proposed UBC included.
@JeffFlake let us know when you get the NRA's dick out of your mouth, jackass.
@JeffFlake "The bill... would have left private, person-to-person sales unregulated." Do you have a response? http://www.politico.com/story/2013/04/mark-kelly-tweets-jeff-flake-gun-bill-vote-90285.html …
@JeffFlake Was this before or after you told Caren Teves you would support it?  Cowardly and spineless.  Typical tea party hypocrisy.
@JeffFlake your reasons are bogus as are your tactics. tell the truth...you are in the nra pocket like the rest of your so called colleagues
@JeffFlake Please serve the people, not the NRA.  Vote for background checks!
@JeffFlake the liberals need to stop crying because they didn't get their way. They need to grow up & move on!
@JeffFlake thank you for voting against the gun bill. It will not stop violent ppl from doing horrible crimes.

@JeffFlake shame on you #coward
@JeffFlake 
Thank you, Senator Flake, for respecting the 2nd Amendment rights of your constituents and opposing the Manchin-Toomey Amendment
@JeffFlake So disappointed! Our children are watching and learning that the NRA matters more than their safety and well being.#2ndAmendment
@JeffFlake voted no on Universal Background Checks.  I am so dissapointed you are MY Senator. Join the MAJORITY of Arizonans #NowIsTheTime
@JeffFlake You should be ashamed. Blood is on your hands for opposing common sense measures. You are a coward and an NRA tool.
@JeffFlake I have more family in AZ but, Vote "no" on simple background checks for gun safety? I and my family will vote "No" on you !
That sure was a brave pro-gun-violence vote to make, Sen. @JeffFlake! Maybe next time you can pull the trigger yourself?
@JeffFlake you should be ashamed of yourself. You are a NRA whore.
@JeffFlake I was frustrated with last week's vote for cloture, but thank you VERY MUCH for representing your constituents on this bill!!!
@JeffFlake And we will remember on Election Day ... Shameful.
@JeffFlake coward #LACKOFLEADERSHIP
@JeffFlake nice replay of the gun lobby crap - good siding with them and against the will of 90% of Americans - shame on you

@JeffFlake coward #wedemandavote #newtown #demandaction
@JeffFlake Disgusting, selfish votes on gun bills. I will Work tirelessly and spend money to defeat you.
@JeffFlake You are a coward and a liar. You placed the comforts of your office above your country and the safety of its citizens.
@JeffFlake I don't care about your idiotic assertions.  YOU WORK FOR US and a vast majority of us want action.  You're a shill.
@JeffFlake it happened in ur state and u voted no-it happened in my state I'm still in shock!citizens will have their vote in nov shame on u
@JeffFlake Bad move! Your actions do NOT represent MY beliefs. That needs to change Senator.
@JeffFlake You are responsible for no action taking place in the wake of the tragedies of Sandy Hook, Aurora, Virginia Tech, Columbine...
@JeffFlake 94% of American want more strict gun laws!
@JeffFlake 
I am ashamed to have a Senator from my state that voted NO. Bravo John McCain who voted YES.

Sen Jeff Flake ( @JeffFlake ) voted NO on #guncontrol . Verdict: Bad Decision Maker, Weak/Puppet, Unqualified for Pub Office.
??? “@JeffFlake: I will oppose the Manchin-Toomey Amendment. Here's why: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphilic_infantilism …"
@JeffFlake Surprised that you didn't mention your support from the NRA. I hope your electorate hold this against you.
@JeffFlake You voted against it because you are bought and paid for by the GUN LOBBY!
@JeffFlake, you are a coward, pandering to a small but vocal gang of cowardly gun fetishists. You are underserving of the office you hold.
@JeffFlake Why did that RINO idiot @SenJohnMcCain vote for it?  Oh yeah, he's a schmuck. #2ndAmendment
@JeffFlake SHAME ON YOU!!!
@JeffFlake <-- Big #FAIL
Senator @JeffFlake opposes more strict #BackgroundChecks on private sale of #guns http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/opinion/a-senate-in-the-gun-lobbys-grip.html?_r=1& …
@JeffFlake did the people who type in caps scare you coward maybe you can buy a backbone with that nra money
@JeffFlake  A shameful day for Washington, and for you,  personally. Guess you can comfort future gun victims with your NRA rating.

@JeffFlake received $6,950 in campaign contributions from the #NRA in 2012. http://ow.ly/kaN39  #rolloverandplaydead #NRALapdogs
@JeffFlake Thank you for protecting the 2nd Amendment rights of all Arizona citizens & voting no. It took courage to do so.
@JeffFlake may this term be your last
@JeffFlake you chose not inconveniencing gun owners over the life of a child today - pure and simple. What is wrong with your priorities?
. @JeffFlake So disappointed that you blocked vote on the Manchin-Toomey amendment.  You are our Senator, but did not vote out will.
@JeffFlake You oppose the Manchin Toomey amendment because the NRA owns you.  You are a public servant first and answer to our voices first
@JeffFlake #NRA increased $$$ to @GOP after #SandyHook. How much per child did you get? We will remember. #stoprush #demandAction
@JeffFlake  Sen. say they're afraid of NRA. Your fear worth more than terror of mass-murdered 1st graders? Coward 4 hire. #DemandAction
#NRA threatened @JeffFlake w election backlash. But NRA's #GOP candidates R losing.He betrayed dead 1st graders for nothing. #DemandAction
@JeffFlake THANK YOU!
@JeffFlake what grade is the NRA give you... How proud Wayne must be..
@JeffFlake 93% of gun households, 89% of Republicans & 85% of NRA member households support universal background checks. #badatyourjob
@JeffFlake Your NAY gun vote makes me ashamed to be from AZ
@JeffFlake I am very disappointed and ashamed of your NAY gun vote
@JeffFlake u're full of shit. just a slimy piece of sorry excuse to get a good grade from the NRA. U live up to ur stupid name. #whataflake
@JeffFlake I am ashamed to admit that you are my representative you do not represent people of az just your NRA buddies
@JeffFlake 90% of Arizonans want 100% background checks. They will remember your GUTLESS vote against them, even six years from now. Shame.
@JeffFlake I’m glad the letters to your office “were not a threat” after all. America will not forget how you voted today, next election!
@JeffFlake This is a cop out so you can keep your coveted A rating. Disappointing.
@JeffFlake thank you for helping to uphold the 2nd amendment right for me and my family. I deeply appreciate it. Thank you
@JeffFlake You are a disgrace to the nation -- a shameful and cowardly public servant.
@JeffFlake BOO your No vote today for background checks. You're supposed to represent the people, not the gun lobby. #cowards #DemandAction
@JeffFlake Thank you for taking the high road and voting your conscience.
@JeffFlake good job, you Did what you said, what a shame,  you are so wrong and will see what we think of you now.  Not much...
@JeffFlake disgusting.
@JeffFlake Your vote is not protecting anything except the gun lobby and the ability of criminals to easily obtain weapons. Shame on you.
“@JeffFlake: I will oppose the Manchin-Toomey Amendment. Here's why: https://www.facebook.com/JeffFlake1?ref=ts&fref=ts …” / you're kinda cowardly, dude.
@JeffFlake Shameful vote Senator. #guncontrol #stopgundeaths
@JeffFlake Your negative vote is a shameful display of cowardice in the face of pressure from the NRA & firearms manufacturers-nothing more
@JeffFlake Re: No vote on extended  BG checks. You just spit on 90% of America.
@JeffFlake This is what a political coward resorts to when his office is more important than justice.Shame on you and all like you! Newtown!
@JeffFlake Children will die, I hope you can sleep. Your vote was cowardly and whatever your reason for voting to kill the bill is a lie.
@JeffFlake shame.
@JeffFlake You are a coward for opposing the Manchin-Toomey Amendment. Shame on you. Now go away.
@JeffFlake We all know why, the NRA gives u $ to oppose it. Ur a traitor and accessory to murder.
@JeffFlake Are you f*cking kidding me?  Shame.
@JeffFlake 90% Of American support & u fuckin bastard pussed out! The Lord Above knows you more than u & HE knows why you really oppose it!
@JeffFlake you are a coward. Shame on you
@JeffFlake #shameonyou you can just admit that you take the NRA's blood money
@JeffFlake Manchin-Toomey included amendment for universal background check. 90% of American's agree, even Arizonans.
@RebekahMilford @JeffFlake That 90% myth is a result of 1,100 people being asked, hardly an accurate or fair representation of the poeple
@JeffFlake For shame. Remember the 90%.
@JeffFlake  It'll be on your hands, sir. ...on your hands 

#2ndAmendment #"right" #NOTabsolute #NRAlackey
@JeffFlake SHAME ON YOU #SHAME
@JeffFlake 30,000 gun murders per year are also tragic and senseless. Sorry you don't support reasonable gun laws.
@JeffFlake You are HORRIBLE for opposing sensible #guncontrol #politics
@JeffFlake You voted to enable rapists & pedophiles to get guns w/ no background check. You're #softoncrime. #MomsAreWatching @MomsDemand
@JeffFlake You buckled.  What were you afraid of, some commercials.  You are a coward.  #shameonyou
@JeffFlake You oppose Manchin-Toomey because neighbors should be able to sell each other guns without background checks? Seriously!?
@JeffFlake Because you're a spineless worm? Because you have no care for your constituents' views, only the NRA's? You sicken me.
@JeffFlake Here's why Arizona will work really, really hard to defeat you next time around. We'll get it done.
.@JeffFlake Actually you didn't oppose it. You prevented it from being voted on at all. Sniveling coward.
“@cdashiell: .@JeffFlake Actually you didn't oppose it. You prevented it from being voted on at all. Sniveling coward.” Seconded!!!
@JeffFlake As a voter, it is important that you know that your position on this is contradictory to my opinion and it will cost you my vote.
@JeffFlake Glad you did. Thanks for your no vote on gun control. Let's keep it about CRIME control
.@JeffFlake because you are in #nra's pocket? You should be ashamed.
@JeffFlake I knew you were a useless POS when I voted against you. Thanks for the proof.
@JeffFlake A specious argument whch panders 2 #NRA tlkng pts w/ tenuous n strident rationalization implying abrogation of #2ndAmdRghts. #NOT
@JeffFlake Excuses, excuses. You don't want real change. Shame on you for not supporting Manchin-Toomey.
.@JeffFlake Why do you HATE #veterans & #troops & Our Right to not get gunned down by idiots? #USMC #ARMY #USAF #NAVY
Shame on @JeffFlake Your reasons do not reflect the majority of your constituents.
@JeffFlake shame on you.
@JeffFlake "Simply goes too far" is not an argument that holds intellectual merit, merely a cowardly way to duck the issue & your NRA bosses
@JeffFlake you were just completely destroyed by the President's Rose Garden speech. You will be a one term Senator, and live in infamy.
@JeffFlake Extremely disappointed in your opposition.  Common sense and ignoring 90% of America will not bode well for u. #sandyhookpromise
@JeffFlake oh yes, because my right to defend myself means that mental patients should go to gun shows and get guns. #coward
@JeffFlake - shame on you. You'd rather have nothing. You don't care that so many Americans wanted bill. 
We'll wait 4 ur gun control bill.
@JeffFlake SHAME!!!! The blood of innocent children is on your hands.
@JeffFlake i will continue to support you, as long as you don't waffle like mccain.  enforce laws already existent, no new gun control
@JeffFlake Didn't vote for you in November and definitely won't vote for you next time.
@JeffFlake Bad call on Manchin-Toomey. Your constituent and a former NRA member. I vote.
@JeffFlake totally disappointed in your decision, For Gabby Gifforfs, For Tucson,  For our country, you SHOULD VOTE YES.
@JeffFlake I guess you have to personally be affected by gun violence in order to pass ANY bill in regards to gun control. God Bless you!
@JeffFlake THANK YOU!!!! I feel so let down by my sen @SenToomey!!!
@JeffFlake  Good job on the Manchin-Toomey bill....These folks are after our 2nd amendment rights...
@JeffFlake Thank you!!!
@JeffFlake   I support background checks for all gun purchases. Please help pass this!
@JeffFlake Pls reconsider, for your friend @GabbyGiffords & Judge Roll, Gabe Zimmerman, Christina Taylor Green #tucsonshooting
@JeffFlake   
Disappointed you see no difference between a true private seller and those who advertise to the public. What about risk?
@JeffFlake How sad! The majority of Arizonans want background checks but you let the fanatics rule you. What about democracy?
THANK YOU!! "@JeffFlake: I will oppose the Manchin-Toomey Amendment. Here's why: https://www.facebook.com/JeffFlake1?ref=ts&fref=ts …” #manchinToomey
@JeffFlake good
@JeffFlake Bravo Sir. Plz lobby your fellow Senators to do same.
@JeffFlake Thank you sir.
@JeffFlake you are DEAD WRONG.. and a huge coward to boot... waiting until attention is diverted by the tragedy in Boston to go public
@JeffFlake Criminals don't obey the law. Similar to politicians.
#standwithrand
@JeffFlake Please stand up for the 2nd Amendment, it is a right granted to us, for all Americans.Please Vote No Thank you
@JeffFlake I am your constituent, I urge you to support bg checks! I am the majority, even in AZ! Now you must lead, not follow the few!
@JeffFlake THANK YOU!!!!
@JeffFlake to be clear, assuming we agree on who should not be allowed to buy guns (criminal, illness, etc.), how should that be enforced?
@JeffFlake is a f'ing hypocrite. Let's see what happens to him now that gun laws will remain pathetically loose.
@JeffFlake Sorry to hear that you are a #Coward
“@JeffFlake: I oppose the Manchin-Toomey Amendment."

<----you mean you will filibuster the background checks? 80% of your citizens want it.
@JeffFlake Heaven forbid you actually follow through on a campaign promise... #smh
