@JeffFlake Who don't republicans in the House do their fucking jobs? #ImmigrationAction #ImmigrationReform #ExecutiveAction
@DarthWeiner75 @JeffFlake why didn't Obama and Dems do it when they had total control?
@m27731630 @JeffFlake Passing the buck I see. Let's stay in the present shall we?
@DarthWeiner75 @JeffFlake so you don't have an answer then
@m27731630 @JeffFlake OK. They should have and didn't. Now what's your excuse? None huh.
@DarthWeiner75 @JeffFlake they will take care of it in Jan!
@m27731630 @JeffFlake The teabag wing of your party will end that dream. Hahaaaa!
@DarthWeiner75 @JeffFlake keep laughing- the joke is gonna be on the Dems
@JeffFlake Why didn’t you do anything about it the last two years. That’s on you. Not President Obama. @daveweigel
@DGoodmantrublu @JeffFlake @daveweigel no, it's on Obama and Dems. They had control for two yrs and did nothing
@m27731630 @JeffFlake @daveweigel Den Senate passed a bill. Republican House did nothing. Somehow Obama's fault
@DGoodmantrublu @JeffFlake @daveweigel Dems had House and Senate and did nothing. Why? Definitely Dems fault
@JeffFlake @PoliticaILine it's only tougher because you Repubs are selfish as hell & hate a Great President bec of his skin color, Wrong
@BishopJones51 @JeffFlake @PoliticaILine the President is not liked because of the content of his character, not his skin color.
@m27731630 @JeffFlake @PoliticaILine please don't disrespect Dr. King's memory with your vile hatred
@BishopJones51 @JeffFlake @PoliticaILine MLK was a Republican, and his family does not support Obama
@JeffFlake @daveweigel it's tougher how?
@JeffFlake @daveweigel Meh. Where've you been up to this point, Jeff?
@JeffFlake @PoliticaILine it didn't get tougher. You Rs need to do your job and stop playing politics with people's lives.
@SoSezAdrienne @JeffFlake @PoliticaILine the Ds need to read the Constitution and follow the rule of law. The US is not a 3rd world country
@JeffFlake tell em to take up the Senate bill that's been waiting 500 days.
@csalafia @JeffFlake Absolutely!
@JeffFlake @PoliticaILine Good plan Jeff. So get your GOP buds in the House to pass the Senate bill.
@cf_carl @JeffFlake @PoliticaILine agree so long as the senate bill is modified to cover border security. do it right now, right now.
@JeffFlake @Montel_Williams AGREE.Take the senate OKed bill, modify it and pazss it right now. do it right now,right now,right now!!!
@JeffFlake Your mantra should be "No reform, until our border is secure.". But I'm not hearing that.  Very disappointing.
@JeffFlake Spineless cowards like jeff flake are the reason Obama pisses on america!
@JeffFlake  Why pass any new bill on ANYTHING when this arrogant, incompetent, failure we call president will not enforce the present laws?
@JeffFlake shut down this tyrannical president get the 30 million cheaters out of the country or the republican party is over
@JeffFlake Your answer, in lock step with McCain is to give them all amnesty. You are an utter disgrace to AZ. Let's not pass more amnesties
@JeffFlake of all the reactions to #ImmigrationAction, yours is the ONLY level headed response from both the left and right!
@JeffFlake It only got tougher if the GOP decide to pout or be stubborn. Otherwise, it got easier.
@JeffFlake You voted for S.744 ImmigReform. It passed Senate 68 -32. on 6.27.14
R U running from that now? Tell Boehner House must vote.
@JeffFlake @Montel_Williams How about securing the border too!
Thank you for all you hard work
@JeffFlake sounds good sir. Good luck!

GET IT?!
@JeffFlake @Montel_Williams Close Borders. ENFORCE existing. Expedite. Clear Red Tape. 10+ yrs to get it done? that's it.
.@JeffFlake @Montel_Williams How about enforcing the laws on the books.  We admit more legal immigrants THAN THE ENTIRE WORLD.  What a joke.
@JeffFlake @Montel_Williams How about enforcing the current laws? Do you all think we're idiots? Do your fucking job!!!
@JeffFlake #SecureTheBorder
You folks better grow some and toughen up! Realize Obama is sinking this country and incarcerate him. @JeffFlake @Montel_Williams
@JeffFlake @Montel_Williams We've real unemploy is 11.5% & lowest labor force participation rate in 37yrs, yet politicians focus on illegals
@JeffFlake @Montel_Williams Would it be possible to see the substance of that, before we jump on board?
@danrandolph10 @JeffFlake don't always agree with Jeff, but given he made his career on transparency, I bet he'd agree w me its needed here
@Montel_Williams @JeffFlake Really don't want another Omnibus, fix everything Bill that no one has time to read, or chooses to read.
@JeffFlake You're A Democrat.
@JeffFlake Bravo Zulu Senator!
.@JeffFlake You haven't done a thing since you've been in #Congress! You're not going to do a thing other then disrupt! #ImmigrationAction
@JeffFlake @daveweigel - Eagerly waiting for Congress to do anything except quack about ACA and hold pointless Benghazi hearings.
@JeffFlake @daveweigel Congress could do that at any time if the House leadership would let last year's Senate bill come up for a vote!
@daveweigel @JeffFlake Then tell John Boehner to get off of the pot and move the bipartisan Senate (cont) http://tl.gd/nhftl9 
@JeffFlake Follow @SenTedCruz plan.  Fund individually.
No #ImmigrantAction
.@JeffFlake what would be great was if there was some sort of academic discipline to help us understand if we will, and why we haven't yet
@JeffFlake @daveweigel It could have been done a long time ago, Jeff, had Congress acted!
@JeffFlake #ImmigrationReform  1. ENFORCE OUR LAWS 2. ENFORCE EVERIFY 3. END ENTITLEMENTS 4 ANCHOR BABIES 4. SECURE OUR BORDERS
@JeffFlake how about we secure the border first?
#leadership “@JeffFlake The job of passing lasting #ImmigrationReform thru Congress just got tougher, but it still needs to be done
@JeffFlake why? Rep have numbers could vote down executive order or pass legislation. Stop bitchin and pass a bill
@JeffFlake @daveweigel  REPUBLICANS ACTING LIKE SPOILED KIDS. BUNCH OF PUSSIES!  Go do your JOB for ONCE. Yes, that means you Flake
@JeffFlake @daveweigel What's wrong with AZ Senators? Y'all are the worst.
@JeffFlake Nobody cares what you think Flake. #RINO Maybe you should worry about your kid's life spiraling out of control first.
@JeffFlake @MargaretHoover build the fences 1st and prisons to hold multiple border crosses and criminals. Everything else AFTER that.
@dbdvl3 @JeffFlake  US has largest prison industrial complex in the world, & you want to waste more $ on it?  #NotFiscallyConservative
@ScotStecher @JeffFlake then let's let the whole world come in. When do we protect the the integrity of the US? If not now then never
@dbdvl3 @JeffFlake Or we can #PassTheDamnSenateBill
@JeffFlake @daveweigel #PassABall
@JeffFlake why bother?
@JeffFlake @PoliticaILine Right, the House was going to pass a bill.  #Doesn'tPasstheLaughTest #RepublicanCynicismKnowsNoBounds
@JeffFlake RINO
@JeffFlake @daveweigel you couldn't have done it before all this? It's not like you haven't had years to get a bill done.
@JeffFlake Congress has had 6 years to do something about immigration. Thank God we have a President who actually cares about people.
@JeffFlake @daveweigel Got harder? How? Pretty sure same tomorrow as today.  Prob is your base won't support any plan. #excusesrlikeassholes
@JeffFlake @daveweigel Just do your job.  It's not suppose to be easy. You have the bill in the house. Pass the damn bill!
@JeffFlake @MargaretHoover lack of #ImmigrationAction is one of the reasons I left the GOP, please do take action with your new majority
@JeffFlake @daveweigel Thanks for this-but perhaps you can explain why the House hasn't passed the bi-partisan bill they've had for 18 mos.
@JeffFlake where's the criticism for the House GOP who refuse to take up comprehensive immigration Senate bill that's been waiting a year?
.@JeffFlake BS slogans. You have the spine of a slug.
@JeffFlake @daveweigel Do something, anything - no is not a policy!!!!
@JeffFlake Obama says jump and you say "how high, sir?"
@DrewMTips @jeffflake ...<embarrassment to Arizona. McCain mini-me 
#rino
.@JeffFlake You could start by telling Gosar, Schweikert, Salmon and Franks to support the Senate bill.
@djquinlan @jeffflake LOL.  Can't wait to fire Jeff Flake.
@JeffFlake It got harder because your own party MADE it harder. If you'd do your job, the President wouldn't have to do it for you!
@JeffFlake @PoliticaILine Why hasn't it been done already? GOP obstruction in the House. But let's ignore that and blame the President.
@marty10707 @JeffFlake @PoliticaILine Obama and Dems had control for years and did nothing
@JeffFlake press the AZ members of the house to get busy. Senate did work @RepDavid
