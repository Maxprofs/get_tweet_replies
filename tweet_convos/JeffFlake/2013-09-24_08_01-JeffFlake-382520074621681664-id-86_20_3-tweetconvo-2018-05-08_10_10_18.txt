#DefundObamacare
@JeffFlake   
I received a cancelation letter this weekend from my health insurance carrier sighting the affordable care act.
@JeffFlake so has McCain talked you into supporting Obamacare or are you going to do the right thing and Defund
@JeffFlake @brahmresnik @12News   Do you have health insurance Jeff Flake?
@JeffFlake @brahmresnik @12News   I suppose cutting employee hours will force them to go on AHCCS. Taxpayers foot the bill vs. employers.
@JeffFlake @brahmresnik @12News Shame on Monti's. Shame on any company cutting hours to dodge providing health insurance.
@JeffFlake @brahmresnik @12News Are you going to vote to Defund then,Mr. Flake?
@JeffFlake @brahmresnik Stand with conservatives willing to fight to end this nightmare.Obamacare destroys our medical system
