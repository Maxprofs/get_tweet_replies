•If not, somewhere along line, you read wrong books
•If so, how even a moment's hesitation to say "ABSOLUTELY NO" to each bill so far?
c/
•No need for religion to make these no-brainer humanitarian choices
•YOU are 1 of few in pos'n to take public stand re: obvious choices
d/
•Your talk/work=meaningless, not genuine/truthful
•When time to be even slightest bit brave, show you're a public servant(& a CHRISTIAN):

•Overriding principlse emerges again & again
•No Flake bravery, just political theater

•JEFF FLAKE SACRIFICES PUBLIC'S INTERESTS FOR HIS

•@JeffFlake therefore is the opposite of a public servant: he serves HIS desires/needs, not ours
•A few Flake "public interest" actions:
g/
Have to finish re: Jeff Flake another day, maybe tomorrow. Found more statements/actions than I expected that fit pattern.
I had to stop @JeffFlake thread today just before got to specific acts, at least 1 of which I wasn't aware. Will finish when can, BUT:
throughout night & today noticed pattern (early 90's or late 80's) to present of much too frequently acting contrary to explicit promises OR
the @JeffFlake he tries to project, then giving excuses I can't imagine buying, especially reading 8-12 or so.
Found at least 1 disturbing but consistent (w/Flake's actions when it matters, not the image he tries to project) incident I have to read...
about more to try to discern how significant, but regardless, it's a big enough deal.
•His actions re: "health care" bills/real effects in
light of his LDS beliefs & 2-yrs to help people for LDS disgusts me. So hypocritical.
A/
Save your political life or real lives? No dilemma, Jeff: even if you were only likely to lose choosing latter, even if crueler person
B/
would replace you (a convenient excuse historically used by corrupt regimes), even if you lose '18 or either way: DO THE RIGHT THING.
C/
If you somehow delude (have deluded?) yourself into believing or saying better to vote for this human DISASTER (ages 0 dys to >110 yrs),
Anything approaching hard choice or the SIMPLE one of serve public (& do JOB/be MORAL) or serve self: chooses self, tries to explain away.
This is why @JeffFlake was & deserved to be ONLY Sen. (GOP or Dem) "underwater" (& dropping) in Apr-Jun approval, BEFORE supported Cruz Amd.
PLEASE VOTE AGAINST JEFF FLAKE '18, even if another candidate you do not like. @JeffFlake has had so many chances. Will give more specifics,
but this sums up @JeffFlake well: his Christian or simply human morality disappears (& thus never really existed) when choice is save lives
or save polit. career. Any public servant should sacrifice polit. career to save lives. That IS a public servant. Flake doesn't fit def'n.
PLEASE VOTE AGAINST JEFF FLAKE '18 (AZ-R) @JeffFlake

He already did....that's why he's gone!
How about facing responsibility & speak out against healthcare Bill? How could anyone w conscious cause 22M 2 loose coverage =208,500 deaths
One of your AZ constituents here. Could you please not vote on anything until you've checked out this Russian thing. This is going too far 
It's been a year. It didn't change the outcome...let's move on to get our economy going again
Mitch McConnell trying to buy your vote w/$$$. You can't keep it...and look where selling one's soul got Judas (?)



I don't suppose you would try peace? Why does America kill so many of our brothers & sister in the world, & wonder that some people hate us?

Are you better than that man. Maybe look within. Keep up the good work.
BOT Blocked

What's your opinion on trump issuing Threats? When will you and GOP get a backbone

Is the KOCH money worth the lives that will be lostSaving ACA = PRICELESScc: @SenJohnMcCain @SenFlakeStaff
.@JeffFlake and @SenJohnMcCain I'm calling you from my chemo chair to protect AZ health care . Vote No! #AHCAKills 
You have very low ratings. You must have heard. If not wake the hell up and remark on something relevant
You're a fraud.
You need to vote for REPEAL!

#IMPEACHTRUMP #REVOKEKUSHNERSCLEARANCE KEEP YOUR OATH TO THIS COUNTRY. VOTE NO TO TAX BREAKS FOR THE WEALTHY FROM CUTS TO MEDICAID
What about the Senate's "Perpetual flight from responsibility" ? Give up repealing ACA & do real work! Start w/ #infrastructure
Vote NO on #trumpcare #maga
U mean 'flight from responsibility" as in holding the @realDonaldTrump administration accountable for its corruption and cronyism? #treason
You're deflecting. You have a responsibility too. You work for us.
Don't betray us on Medicaid and preexisting conditions. We are all paying attention to the secretive and unpopular healthcare bill
How about country over party Flake?  Can't wait to get u voted out in 2018...
Flake is good for 3 things; photo ops, holding the chair down and voting as he is told. He is aligned with the traitor and the liar!
how about peace making force. Hawks belong in the sky not on senate floor.

BREAKING: In rare joint letter, insurers say Cruz amendment "unworkable in any form" and will lead to "widespread terminations of coverage." 
It's important that Congress be held accountable for warmaking responsibilities, also please don't take away my health care.
even the INSURANCE COMPANIES are saying no to this AWFUL bill. Koch brothers paying you off? A few extra bucks worth cancer children dying?
In #Congress responsibility is not shared. Every single Congressperson has responsibility to speak & act regarding justice & freedom for all
Vote no on the failure #RepealAndReplace legislation that the majority are against, including insurers

America first / no Arizonans first start listening  save or excellent healthcare options for our workers, our poor, and retirees
@JeffFlake you would do well to act like a conservative republican in the true sense. The president must be held accountable Rule of law
Vote No on Trumpcare!
It sucks actually
@tedcruz "plan" is all smoke and mirrors you sold us out because you have no  
BREAKING: In rare joint letter, insurers say Cruz amendment "unworkable in any form" and will lead to "widespread terminations of coverage." 
Its still just a Gulf of Tonkin resolution revisit.  The question that should be asked is- what did we learn?  Apparently nothing.
Tagging on to Cruz's coat tails cause your a coward. Medical Bankruptcy for AZ families? How do you sleep at night?? #Complicit

Actually that's a very old rule some asshats have just forgotten

& the awful #HealthcareBill you're trying to foist off on Americans with the least ability to afford it. Be brave, .@JeffFlake stand up 4 us
Please vote no 
Great piece. The responsibility of congress and Senate is to enact laws for the good of all in the country. Your job is compromising
U SOB ur continued flight from the people of Az who depend on Medicaid will do you in come Nov 2018  pack up go home#sad
Very relevant on healthcare. It is your responsibility to vote against any bill that increase the number of uninsured.
And what is your stand on The Healthcare Act??     Are you voting against it? Or do you want to put thousands of Arizonians off Medicaid?
You probably don't read responses to your tweets, but u really should. Healthcare is what we're worried about. U shouldn't have backed Cruz.
What do you stand for Flake? You are a dugout hiding puppet.
The really important news - TERRIBLE senate healthcare bill - KEEP ACA!
What about Congress' lack of responsibility for EVERYTHING
keep calling

#StopTrumpcare
You lead the parade in the flight from responsibility. Stand up to Trump and kill the TRUMPCARE bill.
Jeff likes to make it look as if he cares about this country. Meanwhile throws us under the bus.
It's insulting how dumb he thinks we all are.
We are fleeing our responsibilities to take in an appropriate number of refugees.
How much insurance stocks did they offer u 4 the bill?
I know you vote yes because you're, above all, a coward. Read this letter to realize how much of monster you are
JUST IN: The nation's actuaries have spoken: the Cruz amendment is totally unworkable, will destabilize the markets.
http://www.actuary.org/files/publications/RiskPoolingFAQ071417.pdf … 
We still haven't forgotten how u sold us out on ur sponsorship of the FCC bill that sold our ssns to highest bidder. 162k u received 4 it
Jeff Flake had made a career of not standing up for anything.  Why do people think he will start now?
Isn't it time to take that privilege away from him?! If he won't do the job he was hired for, then fire him and hire someone else.
Sorry we r all focused on ur cowardice on voting for the ahca and ignoring ur voters AGAIN
Fleeing from responsibility is the GOP enabling collusion with a foreign gov & stealing healthcare from 22 million ppl
Agreed the should not determine the use of military force, ever. Congress needs to how a set.

This veteran is doing whatever she can to protect her son from the Republican health care bill 
you are one of the very few Republicans I hope to see stand up against the obvious collusion of Trump campaign with Russia.
Why would you think that? Flake has done nothing to stand up against Russia colluding in our election whatsoever. Twitter rants don't count
That is precisely the point-tweeting by republicans is cowards way out. Well said @EastCoast_Dude1
LOL Arizonans don't care what you read. You sold us out when you signed on to this despicable Ted Cruz amendment to Trumpcare. Shame on you.
Keep funding those "moderate rebels" AKA terrorists...Awesome Job!
Idk but say no to Trumpcare.
