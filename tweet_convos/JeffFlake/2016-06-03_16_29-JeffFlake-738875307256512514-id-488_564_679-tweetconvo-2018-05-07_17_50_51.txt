@brkend judge should remove himself Jeff/ just good ole common sense - Donald's correct once again
Sorry, but you don't get to force judges off your case just because they rule against you
Julian-the judge hasn't ruled against Trump.. the judge should resign ASAP.cannot get a fair trial
He ruled against him on two YUGE issues: class certification and summary judgment
heck yes judge should resign, No wonder Trumps Pis---. I'm sure Mr. Trump will run background check
Why should the judge resign? Give me the legal basis.
if Donald says he's not being fair than that is the legal reason
As an intelligent person, you should demand a better reason. One that has some legal weight
Not to be rude Jeff but your a Flake
The judge is a member of LaRaza ( just like San Jose's police chief )  and you seem to be A-OK with that.
You, like that orange gasbag bigot, are deeply misinformed. Try reading.@JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump
Commie State doesn't get a click out of me. Got anything else ?
this http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/donald-trump-judge-gonzalo-curiel-223849 …
So apolitical that he gave scholarships to illegals. Just noticed this is Flakes thread I'm done here.
@james_mainevent @JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump
Now that you've declared victory, you and Flake can go suckle up to your LaRaza overlords - I'm busy.
@james_mainevent @JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump
- May I suggest that your fellow senators start supporting Gov. Johnson & Gov. Weld.   Both were GOP longer than Trump!
@brkend the reason he should removed is because of his social ties disappointed
Jeff's own sons are ignorant & offensive, one is racist the other kills dogs.
How can you judge anyone with 2 sons that are that screwed up?  Trump was a great Dad look at his kids.
@brkend You got the wrong guy there, should be Obama. You are dispicable!
The policies you support are ignorant Flake. I voted for you and it is the biggest mistake I ever made.
@JohnKasich @SenJohnMcCain @FoxNews For all of the republican leaders who are against Trump, voters will remember.
Thats just about all of them.
U DISGUST me

#ENDORSE #Trump2016
@Merry__Can @Patriot_MM @JeffFlake  Who needs a 3rd party when you can shanghai 1 of the other 2? GOP is embarrassed
Jeff Flake is on the way out along will all the RHINOS.  Either join the new Trump Republican Movement or leave
@WSJ La Raza idiot...
@WSJ keep talking the more you talk the more people know that you corrupt globalists are the enemies not Dems
With your lousy C- grade on immigration issues, & a 42% ranking, you shouldn't be throwing stones at Mr. Trump!
And Trump is correct on this issue !! Vote Flake OUT
Gutsy to not endorse. If enough follow your lead, we'll still have a party in 2020.
Senator, what have you done to curtail Obama's continuous abuses of executive power? Hypocrite turd. @JeffFlake @realDonaldTrump @brkend
every non-racist is with you Jeff, give him hell, nominate another candidate
@charlescwcooke @realDonaldTrump @WSJ Why?  I thought Mexicans loved him?
Mexican Americans love Donald Trump not the corrupt Judge.
You'll be on the losing end if you keep bashing our nominee. Stop already
he's not even the President. You did zero, zilch, nada to prevent Obama from goose stepping on the constitution
@WSJ Trump is not a racist and you are delusional. It's time for gop to wake up.
The republican party created the situation with Trump, you are at fault like the other party members.
@nikkinbc @realDonaldTrump @brkend
@WSJ fuck u flake , trump 17. We will get rid of u next election
@WSJ 
You go Jeff! I know you'll be voting for Hillary.....
You - Jeff Flake - are ignorant and extremely offensive. And I live in and VOTE in Arizona.
I am a GOP AZ voter & 100% 4 Trump -cannot wait 4 your term n office to be up, Never voted 4 Dem- will against u
The 9th circuit jus ruled u have no right to carry gun outside of ur home. Can't wait 4 new  Hill SCOTUS. Thanks
Support for LaRaza judge is "ignorant, offensive & suggests a troubling disregard" for justice & common sense! Are KKK judges ok?
@brkend So, you don't trust the voters to select the candidate! You want party crooks to do it!
@brkend nothing racist about Trump's bias concerns. Thought you were a Republican. Guess not...
@WSJ 
You be voting for Hillary, right?
@WSJ
 and you're voting for Hillery?
Hey @JeffFlake if Trump is "unacceptable," stop accepting him! @charlescwcooke @realDonaldTrump @brkend Not too late to get yr balls back.
Sotomayor: "I further accept that our experiences as women and people of color affect our decisions." http://buchanan.org/blog/donald-la-raza-judge-125323 …
Trump's racism is his claim that NO non-white judge can be fair in his fraud case. Undermines rule of law, judicial independence.
Then why do democrats appoint judges based on their race & ethnicity? Trump isn't racist, he's pointing out the obvious.
Slams #Trump

i find your disregard for the facts, offensive, your ignorant of the fact leftist activist judges have taken ova
this group took a#this position on trump. Year ago  a hit job
it Twas for the "flake" guy.
@WSJ you don't even remember the Hispanic activist Supreme Court Judge agrees with Trump
@WSJ you scum the Mexican judge is a Mexican activist belonging to 4 Hispanic activist groups
That's nonsense and you know it. You and your ilk are what the voters are rejecting. Wake up.
@brkend Yes! I speak highly of you Senator  Proud AZ Democrat here w/a open mind to policy on the right
Backbencher Flake never trashes Dems like this. I wonder why? Hopefully Flake and pals will be extinct soon.
dude I have never heard of you???
@brkend   Hey Jeff when r you going to do something constructive for the deficit and illegal immigration. Phoeny
@WSJ What Trump said may be uncomfortable BUT liberals have been playing that game for years. Say no comment.
@WSJ STOP fighting the people. STOP working for Hillary, cause that's what your doing. STOP whining.
Not as bad as kissing Obama's butt and voting for Loretta Lynch to be the U.S. Attorney General!!! Like YOU did!
You and Ben Sasse r birds of a feather. U both look like family members in the creepy house scene in Insidious
Jeff I don't agree with u politically but I am grateful that u r standing up against trump & his hate speech.
@brkend @realDonaldTrump isn't the reason YOU'VE done nothing 4 your state with OPEN BOARDERS
@brkend I will work tirelessly to make sure you lose your next election. Sick of GOP traitors!
@brkend Mr Flake support Trump or you will be an Ex Senator. @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump
kudos. You are a man of principle, not afraid to speak ur mind, and I am proud you represent Arizona.
@brkend You filthy politicians are only concerned with your re-election! You all are DOGS! #liars
No, his wording poor, but the judge, like chief of police in San Jose, La Raza member; both biased; COWARD!
@brkend WE DON'T WANT PC POLITICIANS! We want a Prez that speaks using THE PEOPLE's VOICE!
@brkend OUR LEGAL SYSTEM IS ENTIRELY CORRUPTED BY LIARS/LAWYERS! It's time we have someone speaks TRUTH!
@brkend You Pols are the root of the evil in this country!

Hey Flakey, I wouldn't expect any father of the year with those kids you have..Get some advice from #Trump!
Mr. Flake, I never heard of you until your clumsy thoughts were tweeted. Trump ratings keep climbing, thank you.
Could you possibly put more embroidery on your overstatement? Schmuck.
@nikkinbc @realDonaldTrump @brkend
Clearly, #JudgeCuriel does not meet this criteria.
@nikkinbc @realDonaldTrump @brkend
U HAVE THE RIGHT LAST NAME. FLAKE!  DID U GET PAID TO SAY THAT?
Trump Shatterrs Republican Primary Vote Record by 1.4 Million Votes. Great @realDonaldTrump
obviously you believe in open borders Jeff. Your old school GOP. You will be voted out . The American people are done with PC
git, as a racist would, but when decisions 
 were unfair.Word choice apology approp., but not sentiment
judge's race, but apparent allegiance to race over US citizenship Important Trump did not say this from (3/4)
much like left media.Granted,he's not a polished politician,so word choices r not ideal, but not speaking (2/4)
@WSJ Just stay under McCains desk where you belong. We don't need you RINOs to elect @realDonaldTrump.
U & leaders don't get electorate STILL. U come off as pandering politicians, twisting meaning of his words 1/4)
@brkend Jeff has had a few min. of TV time, now shut up. Republican traitor needs 2 switch to Dems.
@brkend as a AZ biz owner & donor all AZ Trump voters would like U to apologize 2us 4 ignoring our Trump support
Ugh, you used the sniveling weasel politician word "troubling."  You're awful.  @realDonaldTrump
He was speaking as a FREE CITIZEN embroiled in a lawsuit with a judge who is likely biased, dummy.  @realDonaldTrump
@WSJ Senator..they are targeting DT w/ lawsuit..at least discuss facts..don't let press manipulate you,stand up!
How do you have time to be on CNN?  Don't you have to take your wife to her boyfriend's? Yuck.   #cuck

Flake will have a difficult re-election.
Hey Flake you Ryan McConnell etc have run this country into the ground.
Bitch at Obama like you do Trump. DJT being treated unfairly.

@WSJ and racist you forgot the key point the Republican nominee is a resist
WHO IS JOHN GALT ? I mean DIANE REYNOLDS.  U Want Hillary? First GOOGLE this:  HIllary Benghazi "Diane Reynolds"
With a son who is racist, anti-semitic,you a Trump hater, giving Trump the finger? Self righteous hypocrite
Donald Trump is NOT a racist, and was totally misconstrued!
@JeffFlake
Obama appoints judges based on their race, including this one.why can't Trump point that out you pandering butt!
Sotomayor:"I further accept that our experiences as women and people of color affect our decisions." http://buchanan.org/blog/donald-la-raza-judge-125323 …
@brkend looks like you have your own family problems and they are pretty serious Flake
Media insist Mex hate DT bcs wall/deport plans. Logical, not racist, to ask if unfair tmnt is bcs Mex descent judge. Shame on you
@realDonald That judge is a part of La Raza and you think thats not a conflict!!! Trump has every right to argue this!
@brkend as mike Huckabee said we need to rescind all money to you from GOP..bye bye
@brkend Flake, Americans are pins the country are helping unseat McCain. You will be next on the list.
@WSJ tht judge has some questionable connections he also has many relatives still in mexico tht mks it suspect
is not a polished politician. But the American people believe he loves this country.
Mr. Flake, you sir are an idiot. The American people have chosen Trump. You are either with us or against us.
@brkend Time for a bye bye - you obviously don't need Trump supporters to vote for you. Sure Dems will make up.
Can't stump TThe Trump #trump206
@WSJ 
Words vs what obama has actually done,,really? ?
Not a mention of obama ACTUAL abuse of power!!
But you are still voting for him, right?
@yvonnewingett @realDonaldTrump I AGREE! JUDGE IS BIASED & AS PROFESSIONAL SHOULD HAVE RECUSED HIMSELF. A HIT JOB. CA SAYS IT ALL
you should have kept your comments to yourself regarding Trump U and should not have bashed Trump. You're an embarrassment
@SenJohnMcCain Thank you Sen, Flake.. thank you thank you for your honesty.
have a great time getting Hillary elected! Why not spend more time worrying about her issues not Trump Can't wait to vote you out
@brkend With the facts n front of u maybe u need to rethink!  Trumps  words were all correct!
Trump U lawsuit is a Hillary Clinton hit piece. They are blackmailing Trump! Pay up & suit is dropped.
weak flake. Very weak
real sjc opinions on bias fool
dumping the Supreme Court Jeff ? How dare you
flake sucks
@brkend You should ask your taxpayers about it.
Hey guy, when are you running. I would like to vote against you. PS - Do some research, his comments seem to be based in fact.
What separation of powers ? the judge was appointed by Obama !? Is that a joke ?
@brkend Jeff you're a disgrace to all Arizonans and the senate.
@WSJ Senator Flake I will NOT ever vote for you again, I am a Trump supporter and Arizona voter.
Is there a white group called the Race that seeks to secede part of the US? That's what La Raza is U traitor.
explain this  http://gotnews.com/mexican-judge-gonzalo-curiel/ …
Trump's criticism of Judge Curiel is based on his ideology, NOT his ethnicity-It's the judge himself who has intertwined the two.
Wake up! Are you a Globalist tool or are you an American?
@WSJ Hey Mr. Fake Tea Party Guy, ever heard of a civil judicial proceeding without a Plaintiff, Einstein?
1. WSJ: speaks for itself. 2. Flake: truth in advertising. 3. Judge has more loyalty to Mexico: oath violation.
@brkend Jeff I see this in biz all the time. Th heat is up & poor Mgmt skills leads u to cave. U don't hav it!
@brkend do you really think we give a shit what you think, you and John McCain or disgraces, yet you get paid
thank you for taking a stand. #NeverTrump
@brkend NO more ignorant than your stance on open borders, so assuming your voting D on next election?
#GOP best God given only talent is to tear into another conservatives. Conservatives were attacked=silence.
