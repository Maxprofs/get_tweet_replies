can we replace Ellen with Kelly Clarkson and bring some wholesomeness back to TV.

Where is Arsenio Hall and his First Amendment interviewing of Farrakhan.
Let's just say silence is golden till next episode
Great first Kelly Clarkson talk show, please make this happen for real, Ellen is the best daytime talk show on tv, Kelly would be the 2nd best, we definitely need more laughter these days.

@kelly_clarkson performance last night on the @NBCTheVoice
Did y’all catch the Team Kelly performance last night on the @NBCTheVoice !?   – Team KC 
Please no. Did not think anyone could be more annoying than @CarsonDaly but she wins.
You sound kind of miserable about someone who genuinely loves life and people. She's so positive and loving. Says more about you than her tbh
Funniest chick ever! I laugh so hard at her hot pepper challenge!

No but I've always wondered what would happen if you took the step up and used your full potentional!
I am sure that she would want to have my talented son Tyler as her first guest. Tyler is 10 years old, a Leukemia Cancer Survivor and a violinist! Check him out on youtube: Tyler Butler-Figueroa (TylerBF Violinist)
I would turn it in a second!
Very cool @kelly_clarkson - great example for us to always be true to our vision of who we are and who we'll always be. You must be pretty darn nutty.

You couldn’t get a word in edge wise! LOL!  Love her though!

I'll be honest Ellen, I have never wondered that.
We need to make a difference with love
