.@theMasonRamsey is continuing his internet-breaking world tour.

Could you pretty please watch #EverythingSucks on @netflix and then get the cast on to talk about it and why it needs to be saved #RenewEverythingSucks
Ellen, you're our only hope. Help us renew @netflix's show called "Everything Sucks". Please, our gay ass really needs it
Go Mason! Also if you're in need of a nice binge watch this weekend, check out Everything Sucks on @netflix! It's a fantastic show with amazing LGBT representation and we're all campaigning for Netflix to renew it for future seasons  #reneweverythingsucks @TheEllenTeam
Mason, you definitely have a gift
