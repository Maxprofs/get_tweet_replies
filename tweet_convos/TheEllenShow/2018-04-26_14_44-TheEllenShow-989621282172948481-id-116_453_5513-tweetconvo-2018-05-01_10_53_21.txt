I’d pass out being in the same room as him
Thanks for sharing @TheEllenShow and Thank YOU @chrishemsworth for, well...sharing! ;)
Always men's bodies,  give equal treatment to your side!
Luv him!!!!

Hi Ellen Christ Hemsworth threw the Thor Hammer at me In the morning when I was
sleeping O boy that Hammer really does flies It woke me up he did it twice that I did know how long about 6or 7 years ago  A FAR, FAR, Away Place unh well who send him I do not know SURF UP Joseph
@TheEllenShow wow he so very hot.
Love me some Hemsworth!!!
Wow
Oh honey hush!!! Even a 53 year old woman has to say Oh Baby!!
@SherlockDean @EmmyBush  @EllyC96
What a man
He ain't no man! He's literally a gift from God carved by the angels themselvea! 
That he is, that he is
were not to bad us Aussies
First of all I literally laughed out loud.. but at same time thinking if a male host did a segment like that about just looking at a woman’s body in her career and hearing blah blah blah.. women would be going totally CRAZY!  Why is it accepted one way? 
Hello handsome 
Ohhhhh my!
A man with muscle.
@bafszewski
The day @chrishemsworth joined the #metoo movement...

Jk jk jk - we love you @TheEllenShow
Omg so sexy @chrishemsworth
Still young and looking gorgeous
I doubt this would be done for a female guest with a predominately male audience. 
Not equal and in my opinion not cool.
She does this all the time. She displayed several pics of Chris Evans in the same fashion when he was on and it’s not a secret he suffers from bad social anxiety. It’s disgusting

Perfect
How does one person get to be so incredibly handsome.  This took my breath away...and I'm 75 years old!
I concur Ellen.
like billy   lmao
Thankyou so much for that Helen.... He's just so, well, ermm, oh boy, you know, just, utterly down right gorgeous 
He is so handsome and sexy!
