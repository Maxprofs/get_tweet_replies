That looks like a whole lot of fun
Yet we have veterans, children, and the sick suffering and dying.
These two are incredible
That's nothing new we are seeing that for a long time that rich is getting richer. It's just 1st time happened on your show.
I need to do this on you show lol
Wow. That is important.  Hope they don’t use it to buy a gun. Ellen has lost her appeal

OMYGOD THAT GIRL NEEDS TO BE ARRESTED
i still remember henry golding and quickie  
best of luck Asian 
@HadesDudynsky ;

Ellen intentionally did it.

As a sly insult to both of them. And to the Chinese community as a whole.

Ellen's dropping "Crazy" & "It is Real"; along w/ sarcastic, uninterested & mean tone while speaking to them.

Even made Wu used the word "Bully" .

@aaja
Great surprise! But don't chew any gum while you're there. It's illegal. Not sure why but, if it's prescribed by a dr you can chew lol.
Lol

Ellen, I can’t thank you enough for bringing such joy to us in these very trying times!  I’m pretty much devastated by what is going on in our country right now, but you remind us that there is still goodness in most people!  Thank you, I adore you! 

Sorry Ellen I have no idea how to directly message u. I'm Canadian and something bad happened today. I now u promote be kind to one another. How do we help the ones that feel there is no return. U have a good voice. No pressure but how do we help these lost souls
You help them find their way back, let them know they matter,, be kind to them. Never ever give up on them, Susanna Twaite CEO of Wrap the Kids
@NoLowCo Was this your episode filming?
No, the one I went to just filmed. Will be aired tomorrow
saying "asian" is racist.
How so?  “Oriental” was racist, but we’ve evolved!  I’m American, is that racist?  Lol
how is oriental racist? I was making a joke
Not a funny joke... Apparently you need to be schooled on Racism, so here ya go!
well i never said my race was superior and i never said anything prejudiced, so if you can add 2 and 2 you can see i never said anything racist.
If only i was that blessed in life. I love your show and how inspirarional u are. Hopefully you will get my email and someday ill get to share my story with you.

#ellen For families that lost everything due to disaster you should shower them with coupons for furniture & appliances & tickets for trips @DisneyCruise & @DisneyParks & while they’re on their trip your staff can interview them & personal their new homes.
