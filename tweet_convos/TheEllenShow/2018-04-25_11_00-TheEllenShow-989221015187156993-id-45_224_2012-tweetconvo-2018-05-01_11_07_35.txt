Ordered a gorilla. Any idea when they'll be shipped
I did too. Got an e-mail, that I am on back order. Looks like the cuties are on high demand. :) I just hope mine gets here before my birthday.
Agree on birthday. My gorilla was for my wife's birthday last week but she still doesn't know about it. Hopefully soon as they charged my credit card when I ordered... So happy birthday David 
Fingers crossed. :) Thanks, my birthday is in July. Hopefully it will get here by then.
Happy birthday to your wife. She'll love it, I'm sure.
My 10 year old has been having a great time finding fun and creative ways to raise $ and awareness for #gorillas for 3 years. On this #earthday she raise $185 so we made this video to thank our supporters!
So she was able to mail you this custom T-shirt she made with her grandfather along with a check for @EDWildlifeFund!
This is wonderful!  Love it. And just pitching in the idea: Maybe you could talk about Scleroderma in one of your episodes, to raise awareness! As a 24 year old slowly dying from this, I would love for awareness to open the path to new research and treatments...!
I would love to donate, but i have been trying to raise $$ for boyfriends kidney transplant. Only $85 in 19 days. Need $2000 soon. Sorry...maybe someday. Love to help furbabies.
Wish i had $ .. love  the cause. 
Dave.
I would love to donate when I do get some money no mater how much I will donate. I need some more ellen gear. My PayPal is maxed out don't tell the hubby but I promise i will donate I'm getting her saying on my thigh with a elephant.(tattoo)

Wildlife carries nothing. Yet they live in fear amongst us. Only with beauty as currency.
 Fantastic 
So sweet, we need more selfless people like that. I wish I had something to give. If I was able to get a job working from home like I need because of my injuries from a car accident (currently no job) I would donate in a heartbeat! 
Can donation be related to charity. Whafever, it is all about mankind virtue.
Can't wait for my baby gorilla to get here. :)
I am still on back order, it seams... #WeNeedGorillas Hopefully it'll get here before my birthday in July.
I donated $7.00
Nice of them
Thank you
Donating to Ellen’s wildlife fund was one of the most fulfilling things I’ve done this year. We need the gorillas and it truly feels  like the right thing to do if we want our children and grandchildren to be able to wonder at these great beasts as well. 
Fantastic to hear 
We need to see mo salah with you in your show plz

Why do people unselfishly donate and want something in return? Just a random thought.
