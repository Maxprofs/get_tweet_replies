Meh. Way to keep that negative stigma alive, old girl.
Ellen I need you to brighten me up & make me laugh as much as possible on such a dark day. #Avicii #RIPAvicii 
Stigmatising pot users while glorifying alcohol
Nice; mock the lifestyle of a minority group that don't conform to traditional culture.  Good job.
ELLEN! High School kid gets caught smoking in his bedroom.. by his Mom! on 420! She filmed it... https://youtu.be/D8u-snBjv0s  #420day #potheads #EllenDeGeneres
It's a national holiday smoke 1 Ellen.....
Get him to care for your weed.
We needed some of that today
Oh pot heads. Lol
Oh, Ellen
oh ellen
I thought these were hilarious  love you Ellen  you always make my day with a good laugh 
Would love your support Ellen: It would help out veterans with PTSD, survivors of all types and our opiate epidemic.  I get that it's funny but please take it seriously, it could save millions.
For all of you people who don’t smoke pot but still want to be a #PotHead & celebrate #420Day I have some extra pots ... #ellen15

I’m just Twitter High Oh, potheads
Disappointed in you, Ellen!

Acting reel wherein my Skeet character has some advice for white drug abusers: STICK TO WEED
If this isn’t the most cringeworthy thing I’ve ever watched...
 genius

Did you know that the REAL Antichrist is very 420 friendly? In fact, give me time & I promise it will be falling from the sky eventually...It will be "Raining weed, it'll be raining weed" lmaro

By the way, I really enjoy the Ellen Show...You bring more light to the world!
YES?
RETWEET pretty please. Asking for help please. You can make a big difference with a small $5. Donation or sharing my campaign with 5 friends. I had to save her life. #chihuahua #pets Vets bill is available. Thank you.
Today is my son's bday.  I no. He's a 420 baby..
For once I didn’t find Ellen funny or endearing. What about a segment on drunk ppl? The headlines would be MUCH worse. But let’s keep the stigma going & let’s keep looking down on ppl who need it for medicinal reasons & those who do it for fun. I’ve never seen a violent “pothead”
Love you, love your comedic soul and love all the great things you do! Mad, mad, mad respect.
Thanks for the laugh on such a crappy day
Ellen, I delivered some pot growing equipment to a legalized weed growing plant in Ontario. Everyone was happy, like a permasmiles on their faces. The security guard had a smile on his face.
I HAVE TO ADMIT I AM NOT 420 FRIENDLY!! I  WILL TRY TO BE NICE ANYWAY! LOL! I DON'T LIKE DRUGS AT ALL ANY KIND. BUT THAT ME I WANT TO KNOW WHAT GOES ON IN THE WORLD AND AROUND ME!! BE ALERT AND BE WITH IT! FEEL CONNECTED....

How about woman high on pot drives car into parked car and crushes band student, leaving him without legs. Yes true story in my hometown. High on pot isn’t always funny.
Do you smoke pot?
I loved this segment. !!!!! 
Oh Ellen #didyougostraighttocokeinstead? #happy420day

Do everyone a favor and get a new artist to create your character. This cartoon version of you is just- it's about as convincing as @Mark_Zuckberg being human. I can't be the only one right? Come on.

Happy 420 http://www.sherylcohncandidate.com 

Medicinal Patient!,Ellen come on!
