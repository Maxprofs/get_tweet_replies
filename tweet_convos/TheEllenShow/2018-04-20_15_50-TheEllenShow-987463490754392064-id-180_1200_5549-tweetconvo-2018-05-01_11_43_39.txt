Love to introduce you to my 91 year old Dad. He was hit by a car on his bicycle when he was 10 and lost his arm. Played golf all his life until just a couple years ago. True hero.
I’m thinking u could share with the world that this Latina wrote & self published her first book....

That way I can eat & pay bills :)

Plus hopefully be seen by @DisneyHyperion to be given a publishing contract

He is awesome!
We have a British version of #LittleBigShots
Go Tommy!
I imagine what it would be like if Toei Animation bought Viacom instead of Disney
Amazing.  When I feel bad about myself I tried to tell myself that things could be worse. Maybe I couldn’t see maybe I couldn’t walk maybe one of my limbs would be gone and I try to stay positive these are beautiful children and I will say my prayers for them

That was very inspiring!

DAN RICHARDSON
(stands)
Action! Extras start walking to your x marks as he begins climbing the building.

The production assistants pull the wires and begin to lift the stunt double and the cameraman on the wires.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
(stands)
And speed, rolling! 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 –
Dan Richardson gets out of his high chair and walks over to the front of the office building. The camera operator stands behind the crane to begin moving the camera up the building.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
(stands)
Extras – get ready in your positions on the sidewalk, we’re going to shoot the first several takes with the stunt double.
DAN RICHARDSON
(sits in high chair)
They can set the extras, we’re ready to shoot the first take with the stunt double.

The Assistant Director walks over to the front of the office building to start shooting the scene.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
(walks over)
Two production assistants went into the office building, they’re already up on the top two floors with walkie talkies.
The Director of Photography adjusts the settings in the program on his MacBook. 

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
(walks over)
I think we’re ready to get started, the Stunt Coordinator finished adjusting the wires.
The Assistant Director walks over to the cameraman in the harness and looks over at the Director of Photography, the production assistants stand next to the stunt double and the cameraman holding the wires.
DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY
(sits in high chair)
I’ve used this camera program before, we’ve been able to edit the footage to bring the quality of the picture up to HD quality.
The Director of Photography looks at the camera on the laptop as the cameraman stands in the harness with the wires attached to the building.
JEFF MANNING
(sits in high chair)
They can replace the blue gymnastics mat with the black net, I would prefer the net to catch me if I fall from the wires.
DAN RICHARDSON
(sits in high chair)
The cameraman in the harness will be raised up on the wires and will film you climbing the building.
DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY
(sits in high chair)
I was able to put a camera on the vest with a very high DPI that is very close to the cameras for the other camera shots. We can edit the footage from the camera vest in post-production to increase the quality of the picture.
The Director of Photography adjusts the camera on the vest as the Stunt Coordinator finishes adjusting the wires. He walks back over to the high chairs and picks up his MacBook before sitting down.
JEFF MANNING
(sits in high chair)
I’m certain we can get the shots within two takes if that’s what the insurance company wants.
DAN RICHARDSON
(sits in high chair)
There would have been a much higher cost for the insurance if we didn’t hire the stunt double to shoot all of the stunts for Mr. Panther.
The Director of Photography opens the MacBook on his lap and clicks to open the program for the camera on his laptop. The Director of Photography gets out of the high chair and walks over to the cameraman in the harness.
JEFF MANNING
(sits in high chair)
I’ve always filmed my own stunts, but for the last couple years Summit Studios has been requiring a stunt double due to the insurance.
DAN RICHARDSON
(sits in high chair)
The studio gave the insurance company the address of the other building you climbed for the other action film last year. This building is taller than the building you climbed in Brooklyn for the Blue Train last year.
DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY
(sits in high chair)
When we met with the insurance company, they said the insurance limit would be increased and there would be an increase in liability insurance for the studio.
DAN RICHARDSON (CONT’D)
(sits in high chair)
They wouldn’t allow us to film the stunt on another building, so the insurance company selected this building in Midtown for the stunt based on the height.
The insurance representative stands near several production assistants holding a leather binder and looking up at the office building.
DAN RICHARDSON
(sits in high chair)
The insurance company was concerned about the height of the building for the scene, so they required us to send them a list of the office buildings for the filming permit.
Wow this kid is unbelievable
JEFF MANNING
(sits in high chair)
I’ve climbed buildings before for other films, but when I met with the insurance company they told me it was high-risk due to the height of the building.
DAN RICHARDSON (CONT’D)
(sits in high chair)
So, we have to get the stunt perfectly within two takes for shooting.
The production assistant adjusts the camera vest as the Stunt Coordinator finishes attaching the wires to the harness.

DAN RICHARDSON (CONT’D)
(sits in high chair)
Due to the risk of the stunt, the insurance company is only letting us film you shooting the stunt twice.
DAN RICHARDSON
(sits in high chair)
The insurance company sent a list of the stunts that are considered high-risk ranked in order. This stunt for Scene #3 was at the very top of the list.
DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY (CONT’D)
(sits in high chair)
I’ll be able to see the footage from the camera vest on my MacBook as we shoot the scene, the cameraman has also been trained to untangle the wires.
A cameraman stands in front of the office building as the Stunt Coordinator adjusts the harness, one of the production assistants brings over a vest with a camera attached.
DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY
(sits in high chair)
I want to test the camera angles before we put you on the office building to start the stunt. I’m sending a cameraman up the building in a harness to film the stunt, along with another camera on a crane.
DAN RICHARDSON
(sits in high chair)
Jeff, we’re going to shoot several takes with the stunt double climbing the office building before we put you in the harness and have you film the stunt.
Several more production assistants line up extras on the sidewalk in front of the buildings in Midtown to prepare to shoot the scene.
The Assistant Director gets out of the high chair and walks over to the Stunt Coordinator, he sends two production assistants into the office building to go up to the top floors for the stunt.
DAN RICHARDSON
(sits in high chair)
Make sure both of the production assistants have their walkie talkies before they go up to the top floors. Both of them are going to watch the stunt through the window to watch the wires.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
(gets out of high chair)
I’ll send two production assistants into the building to open the windows on the top floor.
DAN RICHARDSON
(sits in high chair)
The Stunt Coordinator wants to have two production assistants in the building to look out the windows as he completes the stunt.
DAN RICHARDSON
(sits in high chair)
I want two of the production assistants to go into the office building and take the elevator up to the top 2 floors of the building.
Jeff’s bodyguard walks over to the sidewalk and takes out his iPhone to call Jeff’s personal assistant. Production assistants stand in front of an office building as the Stunt Coordinator lifts the stunt double in the harness.
BODYGUARD
(stands next to high chair)
I’ll call him and make sure he picks up the keys to the co-op, the deli will make your lunch order and deliver it to your trailer this afternoon.
JEFF MANNING (CONT’D)
(sits in high chair)
The nanny is going to take Lydia for a walk this afternoon and I want her to be able to take the baby back to the co-op.
Jeff Manning ends the phone call and hands the iPhone back to his bodyguard.

JEFF MANNING (CONT’D)
(sits in high chair)
I need you to call my personal assistant, he needs to go over to Tim’s office and pick up the keys to my new co-op.
JEFF MANNING
(sits in high chair)
You can take Lydia to Riverside and go for a walk with her along the Hudson River. Tim is completing the transaction today, I’ll have my personal assistant bring the keys for you to take Lydia to the co-op after your walk.
JEFF MANNING
(sits in high chair)
This is Jeff – Andrea are you there?

ANDREA
(holds Lydia)
Hi, Jeff. I just wanted to check-in with you, I’m planning to take Lydia for a walk this afternoon after her nap.
BODYGUARD
(walks over)
Jeff, the nanny is on the phone and needs to talk to you. She’s at the hotel in the room with Lydia, I told her you’re on break until you shoot the next scene.
The Assistant Director gets out of the high chair and walks over to the office building, the PA’s stand on the sidewalk and line up the extras for the scene.
One of the production assistants helps the Stunt Coordinator put the harness on the stunt double.

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
(sits in high chair)
I’ll make sure all of the extras are in their places.
The Stunt Coordinator gets up from the high chair and walks with the stunt double over to the office building. Jeff sits in his high chair sipping his coffee while the stunt double gets ready to shoot.

If ANYWHERE,  ONE adult tells a child they can do anything; if they encourage and expose same child to anything they dream to be/do....That child can blossom. Think of what all the children in the USA could be if ONE ADULT TOOK AN INTEREST IN EACH OF THEM.
Ammmmmmmmmazing
The kid got his mind over his body and nothing can stop him from doing things that he sets his mind to. #littlebigshot

Why so galing

Wtf did you have Van Jones on your show???
RIP AVICII 
Incredible!
What a precious inspiration....God Bless him....
I agree. Sometimes I might start to feel a bit sorry for me, and the Universe presents me something or someone that reminds me how good my life is and no matter what, there's some one doing better than me and someone else with greater challenges. It helps me feel empathy.

True
A true inspiration
Why does that remind me of Hunger Games?
How about why I can't boot out my bf because he's the only person I know in this town... And i cant go back home?
