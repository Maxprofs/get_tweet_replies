Good iam just saying i do not like rap music,god it is my choice not to like it,so please chill.
Kendrick deserve the  trip to Africa...safari ,hope you will join Ellen.
King Kendrick Lamar you rock...........

This is Imani Davis. She's a 18 year old artist class of 2018. She's trying to earn scholarship money to go to OSU Oklahoma State University and all she needs is support to get in college. She loves Ellen. If you like…
O.m.g! I read this and thought you were talking about Kalen Allan! Can you blame me?! Deep States and all!
I'm a Bampot! Forgive me.
NAS never got one ??? Love Kendrick but NAS should ve get it years ago
As good as Nas is, he has not moved the culture and have the impact that Kendrick has. Nas has not had a album hit five million. Every album Kendrick has made went platinum. In a era were sales are almost impossible. Damn is hard copy platinum not streams. Appreciate Kendrick.
Support Tyler's journey!
Hope you enjoy Calgary
It's not surprising. Kendrick is what and where rap should be. Honest, philosophical, inspiring and representative. He is a storyteller that the industry desperately needed and needs.
the funny part us 'to pimp a butterfly'  is better than damn. RiRi got nigga winning.
Nah. But ok good sis.
Love the Black Panther music...
Congrats!
I've  always said that  the end of civilization  as we know it was when George W Bush was president, Roseanne  was the Number 1 show on TV,and Ellen DeGenerous  and Howie Mendel were popular on TV. 
What has this country come to ?
Also Bob Saget  !!!
You are a hater. Be happy.

You haters who dont know anything stay posting. Why dont you sit down for this one. Kendrick Lamar is a genius. Even country artist come to him for his creativity. Google that.

@gsxeclipsepsi
Congrats to @kendricklamar for his well-earned #Pulitzer for music. However, wouldn’t the first person to win a Pulitzer for rap technically be @Lin_Manuel for @HamiltonMusical??
Sure Hamilton incl. it's rap parts winning a Theatre Pulitzer at least showed the committee that rap is an awardeble music genre itself.
They made a microphone for his limp wristed microphone using technique which makes the sound waves travel farther
Yeah
Way to go @kendricklamar

Is this Twitter you? It's very interesting that she personally believed that I had received a prize. Is there such a good thing in the world? ? ? Winning awards never happen to me! Of course not credible!
Well this news just made my entire soul flow Well deserved King
Congratulation to him! May he continue to be blessed
Hey, with all the headlines out there, good for you.  You’re very very special, would love to here an honest remark from you. But, it’s cool.  I love you. You’re the best.
Tweet your reply
Amazing accomplishment for an amazing album, and well deserved. Some credit for the trailblazing has to go to @Lin_Manuel though, no?
Why are you quoting lyrics from a near decade old song when he won for his album that came out last year?
The downfall of modern language
He probably knows more about language than you tbh
He can barely form a complete sentence let alone a rhyme that makes sense.
Hey ellen your freakin awsome.. Im not worthy
Hey now! I loved “damn” and I’m a nerdy mom of three who also loves Joni Mitchell.
It’s what he deserves

Geez so they are giving these out to anyone and everyone as well - just like stars on the hollywood walk of fame. Another respected award gone down the crapper. #Pulitzer
have you heard anything from Kendrick Lamar that wasn’t on the radio?
yep and was like listening to Susan Boyle just with different music in the background. Just another award that can now be brought obviously.
you haven’t heard his music
I have and its Sh!T as I said just more awards that can be brought now!
