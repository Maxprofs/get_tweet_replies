“Late Night with Ellen DeGeneres” should be the new name of the show with all that swearing 
Ohh I know this!  They get the alcohol from the fermented fruit! lol

This is Imani Davis. She's a 18 year old artist class of 2018. She's trying to earn scholarship money to go to OSU Oklahoma State University and all she needs is support to get in college. She loves Ellen. If you like…
That was too funny omg I laughted
I'm not sure about the swearing thing. Not many people say things like what the (%$#*) is wrong with you and then smile or have an orgasm with out looking crazy lol.
Love you guys!

This is too hilarious! I can't with these two!! Thanks for the information @TraceeEllisRoss, I did NOT know those things. I especially didn't know about the "Daddy long legs (not spider's big penis)". Oh, and good to know re the cursing, I don't curse but seems I should start!

Tracee Talks segment was so hilarious! "I'm just saying facts"  
 This laughter is too devil! I sincerely tell you that I will be very, very handsome in my jacket!NH！
f***. my life makes perfect sense now.
