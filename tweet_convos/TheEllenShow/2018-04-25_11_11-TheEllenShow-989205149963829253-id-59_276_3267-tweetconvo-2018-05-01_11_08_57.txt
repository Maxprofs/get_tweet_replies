OMG! This kid is to cute. Lol! Can't wait to see him on the show again. Plus I Miss seeing Brielle & Macey, those 2 SWEET & SMART little ladies have to be my favorite ever.
He looked like he could be related to Ellen ~ blond hair + gorgeous blue eyes
He is the next avenger
That was an awesome thing.
Loved your gift for @twhiddleston. Was surprised he didn't blush. 
but can you send an old Britton to Seattle for this 
L
Well, you are marvelous! I'm sure Tom or anyone on the cast would look great in those. ;)
Never thought I’d be jealous of a 10 year old boy before but Ellen sending him to the premiere was amazing!  You are a great woman!!  From all of us to you!! YOU ROCK!!!
 Adorable and 
Oh ya! That's Brilliant.
Ellen please recieve Jesus Christ with his gift of eternal life. #Jesus

Any chance I could get a signed and framed Avengers Infinity War poster like Britton got?
I saw him talking to @RobertDowneyJr. How can I be 1/2 as cool as this kid?!
Ellen is amazing
Go Britton!
