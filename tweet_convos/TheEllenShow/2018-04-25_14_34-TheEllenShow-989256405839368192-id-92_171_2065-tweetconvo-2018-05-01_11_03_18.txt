What an embarrassment to South Africa.

Meanwhile in South Africa a Farmer is attacked, tortured, or murdered every day. #theellenshow #qanon #theview #plaasmoorde
Kanye loves Trump!
Looking forward to viewing "Tully". @CharlizeAfrica is brilliant in each & every role she's ever landed. She's pure Charlize & no other person can take it to the limit like her!

There’s a little boy in Liverpool called Alfie Evans maybe Ellen could help x
Thanks for that. I had a weak moment today and a bag of cheddar Lays. Fml. Double time on the treadmill for a month.
But why not hire a plus size actress then instead? Why would you ask someone to sort of "mutulate" their own body? If she doesnt have that body type, then why would you make her get it if there are plenty of other options to look at?
Follow back Ellen please!
@theellenshow @CharlizeAfrica Potato Chips, id be chowing down on some more delicious, creative things! Check this out!!! A Rainbow Cookie Cheesecake!!!
Ours too
@TheEllenShow I love u & ur show but was sad to hear u refer to a “fat suit” when talking about weight Charlize gained for Tully. I’m sure a lot of ur viewers relate to this movie & may look like her character. I know u didn’t mean harm, but ur words have a lot of impact.
Potato chips is my weakness
Great lady



Ellen ask her how she lost the 50. I need to lose 20 and I’m just frustrated.
I was just thinking how people think how lavish and awesome their lives are. Yes there are aeesome perks but the gain n lose weight and the work put into studying people and characters is amazing hard work. They don't get the credit they deserve. Perk when they r not a**holes
Everyday I kill myself trying to lose this weight I gained after I got married. Ugh!!   Gym 5 times a week and walking 7 days a week. Even the dogs have lost weight. When ur 61 it’s not easy.
Love what she says about eating the wrong food and how it affects us.
So what are you trying to say about potato chips? I am not trying to hear any of it
That's dedication
TOP actress of our time.
OMG I hear you on the kid front & let me say they don't get it out of the way lol. My oldest gets so mad when her sister doesn't want to do what she says. My youngest is like she always wants me to do things but I don't want to lol.  mine are 5 and 12.
I would have picked ice cream at night .
That's just amazing

@seale15eastcoast Boy that bulls eye was close, she is pretty good.
wish I could do that, I never seem to be able to get where I'm going weight-wise.
Drink Guinness beer...that always works!  


PS... still crushing on you regardless...
Agenda 21 fueled #gmo potato chips I'm certain .... This should sum it up... #epicyte #dupont #monsanto #agenda21 #wakeup #gmo #organic #DNADay18 #DNADay They're sterilizing us and herding us into manageable land areas to clone and control. #hermaphrodite enjoy your chips!
I recently noticed a 1950 movie on my preview channel called "Young Man with a Horn".
It stars Kirk Douglas, who turns 101 this year, and Doris Day, still sunny at 96. Another of its stars, Lauren Bacall, lived to 89.

Whatever was in that remarkable horn, apparently worked.
Absolutely love this!!
Omg I love your show, you're so cool. Full of talent, fun, and awesome. I watch your show a lot

Charlize needs to stop forcing her adopted 5-year-old son to become a girl. That's child abuse.
I'm the mum of a 13yo trans child. I love my kid no matter what, I'd rather have a living transgender son than a dead daughter. It's great to see @CharlizeAfrica supporting her child.
Nothing abusive about it at 5yo, all child can do is wear chosen gender clothes, hairstyle & be referred to as identified gender. Not until puberty is there medical involvement. @CharlizeAfrica is giving her child the chance to explore this properly before big decisions needed.
I am also on the Charlize Diet and I must say...the results really are as advertised.
Nothing better than a potato chip sandwich spread some mayo on bread lay your chips on bread an mash together eat yummy food 
Same - just not for a movie role
Charlize African???? Hey tell me about HANCOCK
~She's a wonderful person to listen to and I really like the dedication she brings to the roles she takes on. Plus, potato chips are extremely dangerous.
I wish I could blame just potato chips!!
I love u Ellen

It's not the chip it's the devilish dip that vehicles the dip!!!

Jealous.
What i really wanted to hear her tell us how she lost it again, I mean the weight
We need to make a difference with love
