The NYPD officers continue taping off sections of the Mr. Panther set as Dan Richardson walks over to where the insurance representative is standing with the Stunt Coordinator.

Wow! Bet you don't hear that much! LOL
I know this may never reach you but I just want you to know you are a very special person and I love you for who you are Ellen my you continue success and happiness you deserve it thank-you so much and bless your heart
Very Nice
Amazing, to have such a rewarding job that I have seen so many take for granted. I know it's not easy by any means. But man, what I wouldn't give to have my own job that helped people. Didn't think typing this would make me . We need more teachers like you
Thanks again for making me cry.  Love you Ellen
DAN RICHARDSON
(stands)
I just spoke to the NYPD officers, they’re ruling it an accident for the incident report.
NYPD officers begin taping off the Mr. Panther set as they walk through the set in Midtown Manhattan.
Tim Baker ends the phone call and puts the iPhone back into his pocket, he walks out to the front of his office building to hail a yellow taxi. Andrea puts the iPhone on the coffee table and carries Lydia to the kitchen.
I also have 5 children who I can't afford to send to college I have seen nothing but tragedy my whole life I saw a guy gets shot and killed at 5 years old Ellen I just want my 5 kids to see Disney Land for the first time in their lives me as well that would mean the world to me
Hello Ellen I'm a awesome father brother and son my mother is paralyzed from a stroke and I lost to best friends to a murder my older brother died from a brain tumor Ellen I can't even visit their grave I have no car or money it would mean the world to me if I had a car so I can
Unfortunately, there's no chance in hell the NB mayor or township will let just one school keep all that money. And if they do, biggest shocker ever.
Wow Love one to another :)
Amazing...God bless you Ellen
Ellen you are amazing!

I need to ask you a few questions about the set and the stunt, the Stunt Coordinator gave me the background information I needed.

After we finish taping off the areas, we’ll talk briefly with the production assistants.
STUNT COORDINATOR

Everything looked normal as the production assistants pulled the wires to pull him up the building, the wires weren’t jamming as they lifted him.
INSURANCE REPRESENTATIVE

From where you were standing, could you see anything wrong with the wires before Jeff said something about his wires snapping?
STUNT COORDINATOR
(stands)
He heard Jeff say something about his wires and he brought it to my attention.
STUNT COORDINATOR
(stands)
I was standing right next to the black net in front of the building, one of the production assistants was standing right next to me pulling the wires to lift Jeff up the building.

When the wires on Jeff’s harness snapped, where were you standing on the set? Did you see all of the wires snap?
TIM BAKER
(on iPhone)
Tell him I’ll be waiting at the hospital when he gets here to see Jeff, the insurance company called and said they’re taking him over to the hospital now.
ANDREA
(holds Lydia)
Jeff’s bodyguard just called, he said he’s on his way over to check on us before he goes to Mount Sinai.
TIM BAKER
(on iPhone)
Andrea, it’s Tim, I’m on my way over to the hospital to fill out Jeff’s intake forms. Stay at the co-op with the baby, I’ll call you later from Mount Sinai as soon as I can.
Tim baker closes his MacBook on his desk and puts it into his leather briefcase before walking out of his office. He takes the elevator down to the lobby of his office building on the Upper East Side.

We filmed the same stunt twice this morning with the stunt double and didn’t have any issues with the wires.

Jeff had started climbing for the first half of the scene, he was about halfway up the building when the wires snapped. It was about ten minutes or so before Jeff said something about the wires snapping.
INSURANCE REPRESENTATIVE
(stands)
Do you recall how long Mr. Manning was climbing on the building before the wires snapped?
The paramedic walks back over to the ambulance and gets into the driver’s seat next to the other paramedic. He drives the ambulance down the street through the Mr. Panther set and makes a right turn onto 7th Avenue.

We’ll indicate it on the forms for the hospital – we’re bringing him to Mount Sinai hospital.

Right now we’re ruling it an accident, we don’t see any preliminary evidence of foul play ruling it a homicide.
The two paramedics raise the stretches and push it into the ambulance, one of them shuts the back door of the ambulance.

I just called Tim, Jeff’s agent, he’s leaving his office now to go over to Mount Sinai to fill out Jeff’s intake forms. I need to go over to Jeff’s co-op in Riverside to check on the nanny and the baby before I go to the hospital.
Jeff’s bodyguard walks over to Dan Richardson standing next to several NYPD officers, Dan looks up at the building and points to the wires.
STUNT COORDINATOR
(stands)
I designed the stunt, so I can give you additional details for the questionnaire. I’ve never had an actor fall from a building before, this is the first time I’ve seen an actor’s wires snap.
INSURANCE REPRESENTATIVE

For the incident report, this is a preliminary questionnaire about Jeff’s fall from the building. Then, we’ll send claims adjusters to the film set tomorrow to collect additional statements and take photos for the claim.

Always chills watching Ellen.
Tina - Accidental Death (CBS) Draft Script Scene #9
Tina Fey & Eli DeGeneres 
Married Joint Filing 2017 Taxes
Invoice $900,000.00 Accidental Death & Suicide Watch Draft Scripts
These are the other new pages of Scene #9 for CBS to verify the payment.
Daily our media gives us feel good stories and puts disatvantaged children front and center. If we have so many poor and $25.000 taxdeductible  by @Walmart to fight hunger? We should remind business they get rich from our labor. #faiwages are not too much to ask for?
I love these and all the many other teachers coming to work every day giving so much to our kids who are disadvantaged. Can we now inspire @walmart to pay their workers better? Surely many parents work for their low wages and their kids deserve better.
You are awesome!!!
Hope I get my tickets to the show.... soon 
Love you! More Love!
Love u Ellen
