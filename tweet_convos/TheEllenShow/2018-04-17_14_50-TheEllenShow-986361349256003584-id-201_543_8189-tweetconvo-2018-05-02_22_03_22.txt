Anyone else read this the wrong way? Like in that instance the baby was excited about doing whippants? Anybody?
Me. lol
The funny thing is, I have never done Whippants and this was my first reaction to this image.
I remember kids doing it in high school, I saw a friend pass out and the thought of it has scared the crap out of me ever since! We used to call it whippits.
Oh yeah that is how you spell it...whoops
