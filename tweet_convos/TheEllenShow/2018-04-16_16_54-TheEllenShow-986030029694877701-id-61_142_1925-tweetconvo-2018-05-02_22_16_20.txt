INSURANCE REPRESENTATIVE
(sits at table)
If there is an incident while you are shooting, the representative will have a copy of the report form that can be scanned and emailed to our midtown office.
Ellen, can you comment to me on your view of teen pregnancy

How great is this show? Especially since @TheEllenShow is producing it! Also, our favorite girl #PamBeesly is in it which makes us love it even more.
DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY
(sits in high chair)
We were able to test the camera on the crane early this morning to see how it would look, we’ll shoot the first take and see how it turned out on the monitor.
JEFF MANNING
(sits in high chair)
The stunt double can shoot the fight scene on the bridge today after we film my takes – did they figure out how to get that camera angle when I push him over the bridge?
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
(sits down in chair)
We told the representative that we’ll use all of the necessary precautions for shooting all of the stunts, the insurance company raised the insurance limit to $2,000,000.00.
The insurance representative walks over to the production table and signs out on the visitor’s log. Dan Richardson and the Assistant Director walk over to the high chairs where Jeff Manning is sitting.

Ellen, I know u love animals. Baboons literally escaped on their own from a biomedical facility in Texas. Of course they were dragged back. Maybe somehow, someway u can help them? I can't even imagine the horrors they endured. Praying u can intercede.
This is cute and off the hook

DAN RICHARDSON

The insurance company is going to have a representative observe the filming all week.
DAN RICHARDSON
(sits at table)
Thanks for coming by early, I’ll make sure there is a place for the insurance representative to observe this week.
The insurance representative closes his leather binder and zips it before getting up from the table. Dan Richardson and the Assistant Director both get up from the table and they all walk out of the trailer.
INSURANCE REPRESENTATIVE
(sits at table)
Good, that should be everything we need to cover in the insurance contract. We’ll send a representative to observe the shooting today and the rest of the week.
DAN RICHARDSON
(sits at table)
All of them have experience working on productions with budgets over $100 million – Summit Studios goes over insurance during their training.
DAN RICHARDSON
(sits at table)
We’ll make sure the production assistants know the formal procedure for documenting any incidents that would trigger the insurance.
INSURANCE REPRESENTATIVE
(sits at table)
We raised the insurance limits for individual circumstances based on the types of stunts in the film. These are examples of how the payouts would be calculated based on specific circumstances.
The insurance representative flips to a page in the contract and shows them the insurance limits for on-set incidents.
INSURANCE REPRESENTATIVE
(sits at table)
We also want to make sure that all production assistants are properly trained to handle any situation when the stunt doesn’t go as planned.
DAN RICHARDSON
(sits at table)
Summit Studios does not want any on-set incidents to end up being stories, so we have required all production assistants to sign binding non-disclosure agreements.
This show is all about sex.
