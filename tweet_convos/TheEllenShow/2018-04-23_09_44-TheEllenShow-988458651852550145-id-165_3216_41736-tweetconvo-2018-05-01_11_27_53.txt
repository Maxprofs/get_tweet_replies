Congradulations
Congrats .... she looks so pretty and fit after delivering a baby ... wondering what’s the secret sauce ???

Wouldn't he be 4th? Charles, William, George, new baby boy, then Charlotte. Girls go to the back of the line, until they run out of boys in that immediate family
Nah, girls now come in line in order of their birth

5th? Not 6th after his sister Charlotte?
1° Prince Charles
2° Prince William
3° Prince George
4° Princess Charlotte
5° Prince Louis 
6° Prince Harry
Why do Americans insist on calling her Kate Middleton- she married a number of years ago & should be referred to as Catherine or HRH Duchess of Cambridge 
They are so rude!
It’s not rude. If you simply refer to her as that long title, most people won’t have a clue who you’re talking about. If you refer to her by her name (!!!!!) most people will.
Then people should educate themselves.... simples!!
Congratulations on your new cousin!
Let's call him #Alfie
Wow congratulations Kate and Williams 

Baby names ruled out so far are, Trevor, Steve, Dave, Mick, Mike, George, can't have two George's.
6th***
He’s 5th - Harry’s 6th.
Waste of our public money when it could be spent on the nhs
It comes out ‘the Crown Estate’ which came originally from Charles II. The Queen takes a small percentage and the rest goes to our government. Google it as give more details. Plus in real terms the cost of the royal family to each tax payer is about 0.80p.
happy for her
Who cares
how the hell is she standing? 
That's what I'm saying! I guess when u are royal u are expected to be stronger? Cant wait to see how Ms Markle is going to handle that lol
@TheEllenShowi LOVE U ELLEN@ LOVE UR SHOW!! HUGE FAN XOXO
Poor little baby. Doesn't have a name yet.
Ellen your Awesome @ForteRhea

I swear down Kate having bare kids is a direct order from the queen. They don’t want Harry to have any chance at the throne 
New Little Prince x
Beautiful
Superb
Nice try but you're not fooling anyone
"Royal" Congratulations Aunty Ellen! Have you suggested a Princely name yet?
Hy
@pankajchandak18
Congrats 
Do you not remember a royal wedding? She is the duchess of Cambridge or princess Katherine . A bit of respect!
#Alfie Evans
Honestly who gives a fuck?
So... did the bloodline reincarnate Barbara Crowley Bush’s soul into Kate’s baby?  Or did they do the ritual during their 13 days feast of Molloch to reincarnate into Lauren’s baby?
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity
Harry jus keeps getting fudged
Who's excited for season 43!?
She had another one?! What!
Whoopee dooooo
Prince Harry is 5th in line...
Yay ! I love u Ellen ! You make me laugh so much ! You are also inspiration to me

Congratulations
Ellen brightens my days... Even when that means today... Oral surgery... Yikes.

You Americans are so pathetic and cringeworthy
Congratulations

I hate royal talk. Honestly.
@delphiabaisden lol
Congrats to the happy couple! May god bless all!
no one cares
Dear Americans.

In the UK the Tory Government introduced a new law last year.

If you're on benefit you get aid for the first 2 babies only. After that you only get benefit if you can prove rape.
Royals are biggest benefit scroungers in UK.
She won't have to prove rape though
I hope she names him Frances or Spenser 

I hear a woman's had another baby. But unfortunately this wee one's mum, on a low income, already has two children so she won't get any more help from the government - unless she puts herself through the trauma of filling out a form to say she was raped. Put that on the news.

Not really her name though is it?
Hey ellen mostra a perereca
Wow Congratulations!!
Congratulations to the Royal Family on the birth of their new little Prince.  May Gods best blessing shine upon him and the Monarch.
I am not in line for the throne. 

Wouldn’t it be the 64-65th season? 
Congratulations @KateMiddStyle
Yeah for Kate
Get a tampon ellen and go back to sleep

I'm sorry but come on.... 1st congrats on a healthy baby boy but I have had 2 boys whom were also descent size babies and no way in hell would I be wearing  walking around,down a staircase while carrying the newborn hrs after giving birth. What did they give her in the hosp
Hahaha...!we can only wonder...perhaps a magic anti biotic to make her look absolutely normal...

Amazing how this woman can greet the English citizens only hours after delivering her son & the US current leader can not respectfully attend a past president's wife's funeral. Congratulations to the couple!

Oh boy! We need to tell Kate to read this lovely children's book!! Im sure her husband will appreciate it;)

Ellen should be 7th in line after Prince Harry!


Ellen, you really need to focus on gun control and repealing the second amendment more so than worry about how many kids Kate Middleton has.
It’s a morning talk show why do you want everything to be serious and depressing all the time ?
OH BOY...GIVE ME SOME CROWN AND ROYAL BABY!!!
#BabyAiden.
Congratulations to Kate Middleton

We need to make a difference with love
