Lets all stands together and support the family of Alfie. Alfie is a true fighter keep this little man
She was the best part of that film.   Hands down!    spoiler -> Her emotional struggle to obey her duties while being appealed to help overthrow the throne was brilliant.
She nailed it
You inspire me every single day, every single moment of my life...thank U so much for BEING YOU...Love U a zillion times!!! @TheEllenShow Love U @portiaderossi
@TheEllenShow how about we start with a all women wrestling wwe event since this is the first wwe event where women are segregated from and unwillingly wont be able to work

Love you Ellen,from Cape Town.

Rumors
Danai is awesome.  Glad you had her on the show.
Hope an all-female "Avengers" film is better than that Wonder Woman movie. It sucked.
Love her and love you
