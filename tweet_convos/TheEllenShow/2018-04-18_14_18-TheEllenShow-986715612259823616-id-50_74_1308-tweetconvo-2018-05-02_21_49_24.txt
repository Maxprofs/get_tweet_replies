Please help this wonderful student reach his goal.

LOVE IT! I'm going to be 55 in 2 weeks. I'm visiting my son in Rwanda (in Aug.), where he is a Peace Corps Volunteer until 12/2019 (or longer). I would LOVE to see Mountain Gorillas with him. So proud of him for his service to others. Thank you for helping #SaveMountainGorillas
