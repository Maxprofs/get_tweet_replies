Hi Ellen, welcome to Calgary, Alberta, Canada!! On the weekend...
Have a great time visiting there
Ryan Straschnitzki, a Humboldt Broncos player, was just released from hospital here in Saskatoon, & went home to Airdrie AB. He now wants to sledge hockey.
A great guy to meet!
I hope you also get to meet some of our Olympians: Hayley Wickenheiser, Kaillie Humphries, and Adam van Koeverden. 
Honestly, so much to see, & so little time!
I’m so sorry that I’ll miss you myself!! 
A friend, Nicole White, will be there with her baby, for your Q & A. I told...
Friday night. I told her to go give you a big hug!!
She wasn’t sure if she could do that!
I said to ask 1st & try... you only live once.
The worst thing is no, right? She looked at me like I had 20 eyeballs!!

If you have any, can you please give me an autographed picture?
Or...
... even your autograph and date would be wonderful!!
Here’s your hug
Your picture & autograph would help me a lot because I’m going through hard personal times & don’t know how to pull through it.
Sometimes we just need encouragement to keep going
Thank you, very much, Ellen!!!

Sincerely, 
Joy
Wow, John is very energetic. ;)
