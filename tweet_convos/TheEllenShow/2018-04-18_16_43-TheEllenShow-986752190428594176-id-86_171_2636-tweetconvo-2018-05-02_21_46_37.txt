Hey Ellen I was watching your show and saw the video of the cat using the toilet.. My friend April has a beautiful Bengal cat that does the exact same thing...so I had to show you a picture of Phoenix...maybe you could start a segment on Cats minding their Pee's & Q's

Ellen I love that like you @amyschumer is such a great comedian even her friends couldn't tell she was serious
Amy  Schumer happy engagement  to you.
Happy  birthday  ellen
Ellen your shows are the best, very funny. You are very cute and generous with a big heart. If you read this, I have a very beautiful story to tell and I have never been able to send you a letter because it may not come to you.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY ELLEN
#IfeelPRETTY
Congrats
Hi Ellen, can I work with you? Please!!!!

Of course she did. No one else can have the attention
She was so funny on your show, even if her mom was there! Please keep in touch and give me a hint it's ligit
Ellen she steals your jokes and tells them to your face on your own show and you keep having her back on like she's the female Jesus! But what do I know I a man and saying anything bad about Amy is a sin of the most high! Criticism no matter how true is hate and wrong! #Truth
I hope you learned your lesson
I have 18 months in the pool saying the significant other either runs or commits suicide
She stole the show ? Ellen I don’t know if that’s ok
In some circles, this would be considered rude
