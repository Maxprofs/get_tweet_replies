Beyoncé is like the most covered western artist in Asia
I’m from the Philippines and yes, she really is a big artist here. Even the poor people who lives in the streets, people who don’t get to go to school, know her name.
Thank you for the confirmation
+ Halo and Listen are the most famous singing contest piece here. It wouldn’t be a real singing competition if there’s no artist that sings a beyoncé song especially halo and listen.
I beg to disagree with Halo. It should be Love on Top.
True yan tea. Pero ST and Lemonade era are paid to dust dito sa pinas. To my mutuals, I am here to confirm also that she is indeed revered and idolized here from DIL to 4...
But ST and Lemonade should be her best albums tho; that's sad 
lack of promotion in ph made that to ST and lemonade. But nonetheless, those 2 albums never left the PH itunes chart since they were released. Still the Queen 
Yeaah! I remember these 3 boys from a TV show. They absolutely slayed it!
This one is equally impressive:
We love to sing a lot. Like, since birth, here everybody sings. Even if you are out of tune or has great voice you can sing in this country and we drink this water called tap that helps with great vocals too 
Ssssh dont tell our secret.
Saaaaanng!!
Thanks for sharing this ellen. 
Wow if they can do that at their current age immagine when their voices fully mature.
Hell will break a loose...
I bet Ellen will bring these guys on the show & will have Beyonce surprise them in the middle of their performance & she’ll sing “Listen” with them!
I felt some kind of fulfillment after listening to this, I mean, my day's just starting but it's already been made. Beautiful
Now that’s Destiny’s Children!
HAVE THEM ON YOUR SHOW ELLEN

Talent man, I swear all filipino people got them holly vocals
@yanccyyyy beYANCYYY

Damn!! Try to watch it without smiling!? So sassy!! They're killing it
WTF those boys are not real.... like how unreal
My talentless self looking at this
Wow  they should  be Beyoncé’s opening act!
Just saw them on the UK's #littlebigshots and they were amazing. Really hope @Beyonce sees them too. A great talent, bless them
this is what you call TALENT...way to go boys....sooo proud of you little ones.
bumped into these talented kids awhile ago Proud Pinoy here!!!  Congrats TNT Boys - Francis, Mackie, Kiefer 
@vicegandako you kinda started this.
@earth2lena wow I hope they never hit puberty 
@licayan_lee
Lol. I wonder where all those artsy Filipino kids went
To school and work bc the entertainment industry in the Ph requires typical good looks or ugly looks and nothing in between. Good looks easily gets projects and ugly looks easily gets comedic or trending projects. Talent is the least of the requirements if they can't make money.
I’m such a sop they made me cry. Truly angelic voices
These World Class Talents will be the guests of @BoybandPH Xperience.

Watch it tomorrow, Sunday at 8:30 PM only at the Facebook page of BoybandPH 

Just click this link:

Destiny’s Children
Filipinos are the best singers regardless of age.
The babies sang that song with their entire souls wooo gave me chills
Had to watch this twice!! OMG!!Amazing crazy voices!
The one in the middle was channeling his inner Beyonce for sure. From his demoner to his range and how he commanded the attention from the audience the moment he made his entrance
101% of Filipinos own beautiful vocals! Bless!

Proud of these Filipino kids. Proud Pinoy.
Wow  Wow 
They are amazing
Omg! Beautiful!
Woooaah. That was intense! These boys are going places.  They’re making the entire Philippines proud once again.
Maganda!!!
Maganda means Beautiful in our language. 
I was looking for the word “awesome”. Salamat for the correction.
awesome is "kahanga-hanga" in Filipino but if you search at Google, the translation is "kasindak-sindak.
Ah okay .  I learned something new today. Salamat.
Mabait ka po siguro..
“@TheEllenShow: Beyoncé, I hope you watch Sunday’s episode of #LittleBigShots. ”

Goosebumps 
Omg! Ang gagaling ng mga batang to mabuhay pilipinas
"Beyoncé, I hope you watch Sunday’s episode of #LittleBigShots. "

Omg! why am i crying  thank you America!!

Absolutely amazing @Beyonce they are fire 
@thenikkituazon are tese your cousiiinssss???
Wooooow
Extremly good
They musta been soul singers in Heaven because that is just not normal for a kid their age.  It takes a lot of bribing to just get my 7& 9 yr old in church clothes.  Quite the unique trio.  Born to be performers.
Im convinced Im convinced im the only filipino that cant sing
Add @legitsteez_kyle to that list as well
Love this! They're amazing!
WOW! Impressive!   
@yes_josh I imagine this is what we sound and look like during car rides.
And all of our passengers are Steve Harvey.

@alex_Duhamel94_ my god les frissons beh
Alexis ^_^
Hahahahaha TROP
I don’t like Beyoncé at all, but I do like these boys singing this song. Great job boys. 
Curious choice to have this “Filipino Boys Slay” banner on top (“three kids SLAY” would’ve been sufficient - their nationality/gender is not what renders their talent remarkable). Regardless, their rendition is gorgeous. @joseiswriting have you seen this?
@jcricrio
gani hahaha feeling nko mag guest nasad ni haha
Tan.awa
power haha
@Beyonce  really an icon in music industry. 
wouw
Bravo Filipinos！

Im done!
Thank you Ellen for appreciating their talents. GOD BLESS YOU
Wow
Amazing kids!
Wow, that performance was amazing! I'm a Filipino just like the three boys from @TNTABSCBN (a singing talent show in the Philippines), and I can say they are totally incredible when it comes to singing. I hope you can invite them on your show very soon. 
Wow must see TV.
Wow nice voice
