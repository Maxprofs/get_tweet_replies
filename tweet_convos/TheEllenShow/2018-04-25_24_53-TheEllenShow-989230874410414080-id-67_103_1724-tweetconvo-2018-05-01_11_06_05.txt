Are you could always starve  il give you a thimble as a bowl

What chemicals are leaching into our skin with this new #agenda21 product???  Ellen? Ellen.... #epicyte #dupont #monsanto #agenda21 #wakeup #gmo #organic #DNADay18 #DNADay They're sterilizing us and herding us into manageable land aeas to clone and control. #hermaphrodite #Ellen
I bet my oldest would complain less about doing dishes if she got to do them this way and I'd have way to much spraying people with that hose lol talk about stress relief. I bet it works on neighbors, salesmen, girlscouts lol jk.... about the girlscouts 
Andy has a great sense of humor!! 
I hope that person was paid a substantial amount to strip them of their dignity like that.

Clean, and cool!
Whoa he is good! 
That give a break to Andy,...
Gross

I think you cross the line sometimes with Andy. I feel sorry for him.
Reminds me of Uncle Buck!
Really Ellen? You've done dishes? You're usually doing something fun...perhaps that should be your middle name 
I really really don’t like these live commercials.
Haha

Your tweet would be way better if it was Portia dressed up as the dish 


Since Twitter gave me my twitter back, let me repost this  
are you bringing #JamesShaw the Waffle House hero on your show like the singing kid that did nothing spectacular or no?
You really need to invite the cast of sense8!!
