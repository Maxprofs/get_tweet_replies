You had them at... the hockey stick!  Thank you @TheEllenShow for showing that you understand  & for recognizing our boys and Dayna!  #HumboldtStrong
Thank you for visiting our amazing city and for showing love for the #humboldtbroncos and their families. #humboldtsrong 
This clip is a testament to the beautiful bright light you are Ellen.  A neighbor posted about this on our community site last night.   Still made me cry to see it.   Thanks for coming.   Love you! 
What was she doing there Judy? Loooove her!
Here you go Kathy.  Ellen is a beautiful light in a world that desperately needs it.
Oh thank you so much!! How wonderful!!! She is such a bright light, I would love to see her some day!!
Thank you for the Humboldt love and the stick 
Dayna tried to find time to watch your show as often as possible. Your show was one of her favourites. Thank you @TheEllenShow #Shesabroncotoo #humboldtstong
Thanks Ellen we love you
THANK YOU ELLEN! WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH AND WE'RE SO GLAD WE FLEW FROM VANCOUVER FOR YOU 
Thank you!!! My family & I drove from #Yeg to Calgary to see you & it was totally worth it! Also, great opportunity to spend some family time together on the road trip!
The hockey stick -talk about knowing your audience  . You are welcome to visit anytime 
I was telling my boys how special it was to see you because you normally lived/worked in the US, and Calgary was your one and only Canadian stop. Our 5-yr old looked at me genuinely perplexed and asked, “But why does she live there? Donald Trump is the baddest!” 
Thank you @TheEllenShow for coming and also for such a meaningful tribute to #humboltbroncos - our national sorrow :) We love you! Thanks for making the world better.
Thank you Ellen.  My partner and I flew in from Ontario to see you tonight.  You were amazing!!  You were on my partners bucket list, so happy we got to see you!!  Thank you for being you and staying true to who you are!!
I bet she goes to see the Humbolt boys.....cuz she's Ellen xo
Thank you for visiting our town. You inspire me every day. You're my hero. Has been my lifetime dream to see you in person. Tonight was a close second to seeing your show.  Thank you for making that possible. 
I've been following the show from afar via @ValFortney live tweeting. :) It almost felt like I was there. #EllenInCalgary Enjoy your stay in Calgary, Ellen.

Ellen is inspirational, after going to something like was a great privilege to go too! It was an honour and great excitement! I've been watching her since kindergarten and always striving to be the best with her great influence ! There's not any better role model to look up!
Even though I couldnt come Ellen, just know that I adore you, your soul and all that you embody. Your kindness, love and light is so amazing. I hope you had a great time here. 
Sorry I missed you here Ellen... unfortunately I couldn't afford the ticket for the nosebleed section... never mind a decent seat... but I had hoped I could have. You're a huge inspiration to me. I hope you enjoyed your stay here in Calgary!
