OFFICER BLOCH
(stands at chalkboard)
I’ll call Detective Robinson at the North Hollywood police station to discuss the case and preliminary evidence we’ve collected from the set in Midtown.
OFFICER BLOCH
(stands at chalkboard)
We’ll go over the expert’s report and go into the evidence room to see a demonstration of the wires.
The Sergeant walks out of the meeting area and walks back down the hall to his office.
SERGEANT
(stands)
1PP doesn’t want a lot of press, we’re starting our further investigation of Manning’s death. I will prepare a brief statement for a press conference at 1PP on Friday.
SERGEANT
(stands)
Good, Summit Studios will be flying all of the production crew back to LA for Nation Star Insurance to interview all of them for the insurance claim.
OFFICER BLOCH
(stands at chalkboard)
I’ll make copies of the expert’s report for everyone to go over the report before we do a demonstration with the wires. I can call Detective Robinson this afternoon after we meet with the insurance claim adjusters.
SERGEANT (CONT’D)
(stands)
They arrested and convicted Leah, their nanny, for the murder of Monica Williams. Officer Bloch, I want you to call Detective Robinson to go over the preliminary evidence for the case.
SERGEANT (CONT’D)
(stands)
Detective Robinson works with LAPD celebrity police on cases involving victims, who are film stars. He works out of the North Hollywood police station and investigated Monica’s death.
The Sergeant walks up to the chalkboard and writes a name and contact phone number on the board. The other officers sit in chairs in front of the board sipping cups of coffee.
SERGEANT
(stands)
I also spoke to LAPD celebrity police, there is a detective in LA that has a lot of experience working on film sets. He investigated the death of Jeff Manning’s ex-wife actress Monica Williams after she was strangled at their home in the Hollywood Hills.
Officer Bloch takes the report and flips through the pages as he stands in front of the chalkboard.
SERGEANT
(stands)
We have the broken wires and a regular wire to go through the expert’s report.

The Sergeant hands the report to Officer Bloch as he stands at the chalkboard and writes more notes.
SERGEANT
(stands)
National Star Insurance has reason to believe that Mr. Manning’s death was not an accident based on the damage to the wires. They found an inconsistency with one of the wires when they examined it with the rest of the wires.
OFFICER BLOCH
(stands at chalkboard)
We ruled Jeff Manning’s death an accident based on our initial investigation of the set and questioning.
SERGEANT
(stands)
I just got off the phone with Nation Star Insurance, they sent over the broken wires this morning for us to file as evidence. They already spoke to an expert about the wires and had them examine them in their office last night.

Officer Bloch writes notes on the chalkboard as the Sergeant walks into the meeting area.
OFFICER BLOCH
(stands at chalkboard)
We’re going to be working with Nation Star Insurance on this case, they already sent two claims adjusters to the set in Midtown yesterday to work on the insurance claim.
FADE IN SCENE #11

INT. NYPD PRECINCT – MIDTOWN POLICE STATION
Officers walk into the precinct and sit down at desks in a meeting area, one of the officers walks over to a chalkboard holding a file folder.
Tim Baker hangs up the phone on the desk and opens a new email message to send an email to the nursing home.

FADE OUT
TIM BAKER
(on the phone)
I will let the nursing home know that you’re meeting with the judge about visitation at the nursing home. Jeff’s father will make the decision about cremation or burial for Jeff’s body.
RODNEY PATTERSON, ESQ (CONT’D)
(on the phone)
I’ll contact the nanny agency today before the hearing on Friday to discuss visitation, Jeff has already been paying for the cost of the nursing home in addition to a monthly stipend.
Rodney Patterson, Esq. looks at the notes on his legal pad and looks at the client file on the computer.
RODNEY PATTERSON, ESQ
(on the phone) 
We’re already paying her a salary as a nanny for Lydia, she can take her to the nursing home for visiting hours with Jeff’s father.
RODNEY PATTERSON, ESQ
(on the phone)
I can schedule a hearing with Monica’s mother’s attorney on Friday to discuss the visitation, Andrea was also hired full-time by Jeff.
TIM BAKER
(on the phone)
For joint custody, Jeff’s father is fully functional and is able to have visiting hours. We already notified the nursing home about Lydia, he wants to be able to see Lydia.
TIM BAKER
(on the phone)
I spoke to the hospital this morning about Jeff’s body, his father is the next of kin to decide about either burying or cremating his body.
RODNEY PATTERSON, ESQ
(on the phone)
Tim, it’s Rodney Patterson. I needed to talk to you about the custody hearing this morning about Lydia, we weren’t able to get sole custody due to Jeff’s death and Monica’s mother is already filing to contest the joint custody.
Tim Baker hangs up the phone and opens Jeff’s client file on his desk. An hour later, his phone rings again on his desk and he picks it up.

TIM BAKER (CONT’D)
(on the phone)
Tim Baker.
TIM BAKER
(on the phone)
After he gets back to his room later today, I’ll call him to discuss the health form. I already notified his nursing home last night about his death from the fall.
NURSE
(on the phone)
Mr. Manning’s body will be stored here at the hospital while NYPD completes their investigation, I need to be able to indicate on the health form whether his body will be buried or cremated.
TIM BAKER
(on the phone)
I can call him this afternoon at the nursing home when he gets back from his afternoon activities.
The nurse starts typing in the patient file on the computer and looks at one of the documents in the file folder.

NURSE
(on the phone)
Is Mr. Manning’s father able to make a decision about his body for the hospital records?
TIM BAKER
(opens file drawer)
Jeff’s parents are divorced, his mother died a couple years ago and his father is currently in a nursing home located in the city. We moved his father to the nursing home last year, it’s located near Park Slope, Brooklyn.
NURSE
(on the phone)
Does Mr. Manning have living parents, who can be contacted about making the final decision regarding his body burial or cremation?
TIM BAKER
(on the phone)
Mr. Manning’s ex-wife was killed last year, she was the last next of kin listed on his health forms. He doesn’t have any siblings to contact for the burial of the body.
NURSE
(on the phone)
There is an issue with the next of kin to make the final decision about cremation or burial.

The nurse looks over the document from the insurance company and looks at the patient file on the computer.
NURSE
(on the phone)
We updated Mr. Manning’s health records at the hospital and have the body stored for police to complete an autopsy. The insurance company is on set today to complete the insurance claim, they’ve sent us the information from the incident report.
TIM BAKER
(on the phone)
Yes, I remember meeting you briefly yesterday at the hospital.

Nancy sits at the front desk with Jeff Manning’s file open next to the computer, she looks at one of the pages and types information into the computer.
TIM BAKER
(picks up phone)
This is Tim Baker.

NURSE
(on the phone)
Hello, Tim. This is Nancy from Mount Sinai, I was one of the nurses that treated Mr. Manning in the emergency room.

Tim Baker sits at his desk in his office and types on the iMac, the phone rings on his desk as he finishes typing an email message and clicks the send button.
CLAIMS ADJUSTER PETERS
(stands)
The initial police report is included with the incident report online, we update the insurance claim as new information is uncovered during the police investigation.
CLAIMS ADJUSTER PETERS
(stands)
In these types of situations where there could be negligence, we indicate it as an accidental death until the police complete their investigation.
CLAIMS ADJUSTER MATTHEWS
(stands)
We’re going to indicate it as an accidental death for the insurance claim, but NYPD still needs to complete their investigation.
Both of the claims adjusters look at the broken wire as the production assistants stand next to the Stunt Coordinator and Dan Richardson.
DAN RICHARDSON
(stands)
We followed procedure for setting up the rig, but I highly doubt someone in my production would intentionally make an actor fall.
CLAIMS ADJUSTER MATTHEWS
(looks at wires)
At this stage of the NYPD investigation and the insurance assessment, we have to consider all possibilities, including the possibility that someone in the production intentionally made the wire snap.
STUNT COORDINATOR
(stands)
I monitored the setup of the rig and the wires, we followed studio procedure for setting up the rig. This building is taller than the building in Bushwick, Brooklyn that Jeff climbed for the Blue Train last year.
Will ariana come to uuuuuur show soon?
One of the production assistants hands one of the broken wires to Claims Adjuster Peters, he holds the broken wire and looks at it closely.
CLAIMS ADJUSTER MATTHEWS
(looks at wires)
We know that the stunt was setup properly, but there is still an issue of negligence that caused the wires to break and Mr. Manning to fall.
CLAIMS ADJUSTER MATTHEWS
(looks at wires)
The other possibility is that the broken wires was an act done on purpose to hurt or possibly kill Mr. Manning.
CLAIMS ADJUSTER PETERS (CONT’D)
(looks at wires)
Right now Jeff’s death has been ruled an accident, but there is still the issue of negligence.
The production assistant pulls the lever and brings down the broken wires from Jeff’s harness, one of the claims adjusters picks up one of the undamaged wires to compare the two wires.
CLAIMS ADJUSTER PETERS
(looks at wires)
We need to take a look at the broken wires and compare them to the normal wires to see the damage from Jeff’s fall.
One of the production assistants picks up the rig to demonstrate pulling the wires using the pulley on the rig. The two claims adjusters look at the rig as the production assistant pulls the wires to demonstrate the rig.
STUNT COORDINATOR
(stands)
The metal wires are designed to hold the extra weight of the harness that is worn by the actor, all of the production assistants are trained to operate the wires as part of their training for Summit Studios.
PRODUCTION ASSISTANT #1
(stands)
In one of the scenes he climbed a building using the same rig. But, the building in Brooklyn wasn’t as tall as this building.
PRODUCTION ASSISTANT #1
(stands)
I’ve worked with Jeff on other action films for the studio, I worked with Jeff last year when he filmed the Blue Train in Bushwick, Brooklyn.
STUNT COORDINATOR
(stands)
It’s extremely rare for the wires to snap mid-stunt, they’re made from a very heavy metal that is capable of handling a lot of weight.
CLAIMS ADJUSTER MATTHEWS
(looks at wires)
In your experience as a Stunt Coordinator – have you ever seen the wires break while shooting a stunt?

The two production assistants stand next to the Stunt Coordinator as he points to the rig and wires hanging from the building.
Stella
STUNT COORDINATOR
(stands)
The lever controls how fast the wires move through the pulley, it’s very rare that the wires break during a stunt.
STUNT COORDINATOR
(stands)
Summit Studios uses the same standard wires for all of the stunts in action films, they are heavy metal wires used for scenes that involve climbing.
CLAIMS ADJUSTER PETERS
(looks at document)
When the wires are pulled for the stunt, is there any way to prevent them from breaking?
CLAIMS ADJUSTER MATTHEWS
(looks at document)
He only had one injury on record when he was shooting last year, a broken ankle while shooting one of his stunts.
CLAIMS ADJUSTER MATTHEWS
(looks at document)
When the studio drafted the contract with the insurance company, we looked up Mr. Manning’s insurance history with Summit Studios.
Claims Adjuster Matthews writes more notes on the document in his leather binder as the other adjuster examines the wires.

STUNT COORDINATOR
(stands)
Due to the insurance contract, we were restricted to only two takes with Jeff Manning on the building.
Beautiful

PRODUCTION ASSISTANT #1
(stands)
We use a standard procedure for setting up the rigs with wires for stunts, all of the metal wires are setup by the Stunt Coordinator.
PRODUCTION ASSISTANT #2
(stands)
I didn’t notice anything wrong with the cameraman’s wires as I was attaching them to his harness.
CLAIMS ADJUSTER PETERS
(looks at wires)
Did either of you notice anything unusual with the wires before you started pulling Jeff and the cameraman up the building?

Claims Adjuster Matthews pulls one of the metal wires with one hand to see the rig move the wires.
PRODUCTION ASSISTANT #2
(stands)
I was assigned to the cameraman for the stunt, we didn’t have any issues with his wires while he was being pulled up the building.
CLAIMS ADJUSTER MATTHEWS
(looks at wires)
Which one of you was operating the rig and wires for Jeff?

PRODUCTION ASSISTANT #1
(stands)
I was pulling the wires for Jeff’s harness during the stunt and I also was operating the wires for the stunt double.
Food...
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
(holds clipboard)
These are the two production assistants that were operating the wires during the stunt, one of them was controlling the wires for Jeff and the other was controlling the wires for the cameraman.
Claims Adjuster Peters looks at the rig and makes more notes on the document, the Assistant Director looks at the building with the wires hanging. Two of the production assistants walk over to where the Assistant Director is standing.
STUNT COORDINATOR
(stands)
We use the rig to control the wires as the actor climbs with the harness, the stunt was designed to make it easier for Jeff to climb up the building for the stunt and prevent a fall. I’ve never had an actor’s wires snap while climbing a building.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
(stands)
I saw Jeff hanging awkwardly on the wires next to the cameraman wearing the camera vest. Jeff said that his wires were snapping on his harness as the PA’s were pulling his wires using the rig.
The Assistant Director looks at his clipboard as Dan Richardson answers the questions from the two insurance claim adjusters.

CLAIMS ADJUSTER PETERS
(looks at wires)
After the AD told the extras to stop walking, did Jeff say anything else from the building?
DAN RICHARDSON
(stands)
a cameraman on wires wearing a camera vest and a third camera on a crane filming Jeff as he was climbing the building.
DAN RICHARDSON
(stands)
I told all of the cameras to stop rolling, the Director of Photography had three cameras shooting the scene – one camera on the ground shooting the extras walking,
CLAIMS ADJUSTER MATTHEWS
(looks at wires)
What happened after the AD told the extras to stop walking on the sidewalk?
two chicks - when does it stop @CardiBCrew
The Assistant Director walks over holding a clipboard to where Dan Richardson and the Stunt Coordinator are standing with the two claims adjusters.
Oh what a relief it is
STUNT COORDINATOR (CONT’D)
(stands)
Jeff was having trouble climbing to the next block after shooting the prop gun, that’s when the AD told the extras to stop walking down the sidewalk to allow us to check Jeff’s wires.
Claims Adjuster Peters continues writing notes on the document in his leather binder and looks over at the wires.
STUNT COORDINATOR
(stands)
The cameraman was on wires right next to Jeff wearing a camera vest, he said to the PA in the window that something was wrong with Jeff’s wires. The PA sent the message over walkie talkie to the PA’s operating the rig from the ground.
DAN RICHARDSON
(stands)
Once Jeff reached one of the markers on the building, he shot several dummy bullets from his prop gun. After shooting the gun, Jeff was climbing to the next block when he said that something could be wrong with his wires.
we want Nicki on the show #ChunLi #BarbieTingz
Claims Adjuster Matthews looks at the wires hanging on the side of the building and examines one of the wires on the rig, he makes more notes on the document.
CLAIMS ADJUSTER PETERS
(looks at wires)
When did you first notice that something may be wrong with Jeff’s wires on the building?
DAN RICHARDSON
(stands)
When Jeff was on the building, I couldn’t tell that the first wire had snapped, the production assistant signaled over to me that something may be wrong.
CLAIMS ADJUSTER PETERS
(looks at document)
I see all of the scenes listed here in the insurance contract, we assessed the stunt in Scene #3 as very high risk, which led to the increase up to $2,000,000.00 for the liability insurance.
