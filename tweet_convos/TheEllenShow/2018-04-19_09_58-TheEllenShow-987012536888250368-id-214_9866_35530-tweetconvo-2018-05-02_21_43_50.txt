Wow . She is everywhere ; They are serious.. but I’m not sure what she’s selling .. is she a comedian/ rapper ? Like Will Smith did ? I saw a commercial where she doing a bird call.. r we laughing w/her or at her? This “Trump reality” will fuck ya head up ..

@pateverman1
It’s gonna be weird with a first name like “Fatherless”

Lmaoooo go to bed
I mean... you could compromise on “Susan” and “Ellen” to make Sue Ellen  Throwback to the early 90’s 

@jesspyman_
But, if she was a good liberal - she would get an abortion.
Cardi got fire nails 
Never knew Cardi B is very hilarious 
Dang! I’ll name my baby Ellen for $20,000 even if it’s a boy 
@bobbiegallardo
She looks soo good 
#NewMoney 
@sklinkhammer1
That baby gift is absolutely everything!!! Ellen for the win!!!
The question ive always wanted to ask people with long nails.
“Can I put it in the middle name” lol I love CARDI she’ll be good as a comedian TBH and making music OFC !
She trying to secure that bag with the middle name compromise. I know that's right.
Cardi C?
@JosephinyMac “Susan” 
That outfit was everything!
Cardi banging on Ellen, lol.  
No one gives a shit.
But here you are commenting
Did i just hear her saying “taht is so bayoooot”???
Is it Onset?
I was thinking "lil bitch"
I just don’t get why this person is a celebrity. Doesn’t say much to me about celebrity standards these days at all. #Trashy
Naming a baby is a huge deal. Names are with you always, unlike this baby’s father unfortunately
She is hilarious !!! I saw her on @jimmyfallon and laughed my a$$ off !
I can change my name into Ellen for $20.000 and I’m serious

She's crazy 
is this girl on something or is she always like that?..
She must be on something
they showed video of her twerking on ground pregnant. If anyone with a sane mind saw themselves acting a fool?! They would not honestly believe it was cute or normal.We are a refection of our family/parents. It seems like she was not raised well at all!

“I’ll give you $20,000 if you name it Ellen”
Cardi B : “can I put it as the middle name...”
She tried it. 
It's like talking to a 5 year old

HELP ME PLEASE!!! Need this jersey @pick_six22 @Patriots 
She speaks..
Not a big fan of her musicality... But her sense of humor is unmatched in this wild entertainment industry. Especially compared to all these Narcissists bisshhes like Minaj and Beyonce.

My wife mother of 2 brain tumor survivor has BRCA 2 cancer gene and had double mastectomy and hysterectomy is 2 quarters shy of completing her BSN in nursing but we ran out of funds. please check out her GOFUNDME https://www.gofundme.com/plz-help-finish-bsn-nursing-school …
How do people know these aren't scams? People make up any fake story to collect money
Here's a picture of my wife's nursing school name badge for LOMA LINDA SCHOOL OF NURSING.  IN LOMA LINDA CA
I love herrrrr okurrtt 
Reaction to Susan is the best 
you mean the baby got a "normal" name, wasn't expecting that to happen.
What's a "normal" name? Inquiring minds want to know.
Like Susan, Terrance, Lorraine, or Kevin. Not Chicago, or Apple, or Blue Ivy, or Mazarati, etc.
Who are you to judge what is normal?
I'm allowed to have an a opinion at 51 years old and don't need anyone's approval to have one.
And I'm allows to tell you your opinion is bullshit especially when it comes to this.

You are abnormal in your mentality

Probably a Trump voter with your level of logic and reason.

You don't get to determine what is normal or not, you don't control people.
I actually voted for Hillary, and  next time I have an opinion I'll consult you first lol.
“you can clean your butt, you can do IT” omfg 
Normal name or Celebrity baby name.
What a world only in america u go from zero to 100
Ur so nice @TheEllenShow
@yasminetaylor_ I actually love her
I bet the baby is named after Offset or something linked to Offset since she's forever rapping about him
Awwwwww
Ok
Cardi B, Ellen, and Bernie Sanders should all be imprisoned. Their nonsense and propaganda is bad for this country, and for the psyche of out communities. Socialism is a crime and God!
Trump voter. Lol.
Did my massive IQ give it away??
Actually the opposite. Suggesting prison for people who thinks differently then you gave you away.
for me it was the 5 followers
