Claims Adjuster Matthews looks at one of the wires for the rig and makes more notes on the document in his leather binder.
How can she be in her 30s and look 18? She's so beautiful

CLAIMS ADJUSTER PETERS
(looks at document)
I see all of the scenes listed here in the insurance contract, we assessed the stunt in Scene #3 as very high risk, which led to the increase up to $2,000,000.00 for the liability insurance.
Invite the cast of #Sense8 on your show. They have a special coming out on June 8, on @Netflix #Netflix.

Sense8 has done so much for the #LGBTQ community. They deserve to get attention and shine a light on all the good they did for gay people. That show is pure love.
Awesome lol

Claims Adjuster Peters flips through the document in his leather binder and looks at one of the pages in the insurance contract.
DAN RICHARDSON
(stands)
We were in the middle of shooting Scene #3 yesterday, there are 4 scenes in the movie that required Jeff to use the wires to either jump or climb. Scenes #2, 3, 9 and 10 all had stunts.
Hilarious
CLAIMS ADJUSTER MATTHEWS
(stands)
For Mr. Panther, how many scenes require using the wires?
CLAIMS ADJUST PETERS (CONT’D)
(stands)
The insurance company has worked with the studio before on preparing insurance contracts for films similar to Mr. Panther. We’ll need to take one of the wires as a sample, NYPD will collect the broken wires as evidence.
Claims Adjuster Matthews writes more notes on the document as Claims Adjuster Peters looks at the wires for the rig.
CLAIMS ADJUSTER PETERS
(stands)
There is also an issue of negligence, we know that Mr. Manning didn’t die due to his own fault. Therefore, the production and members of the crew may be liable for his death due to negligence.
CLAIMS ADJUSTER MATTHEWS
(stands)
For the initial insurance contract, we assessed the amount of the insurance liability based on the logistics of the stunt. We have to examine the wires to allow the insurance company to confirm that Mr. Manning’s death was an accident.
STUNT COORDINATOR (CONT’D)
(stands)
I’ve performed this stunt for other action films, Jeff Manning performed a similar stunt for the Blue Train last year. He climbed an office building in Bushwick, Brooklyn for the film. I was a paid consultant for the film.
Dan Richardson stands next to the Stunt Coordinator as Claims Adjuster Peters and Claims Adjuster Matthews look at the rig with the wires.
STUNT COORDINATOR
(stands)
The production assistant signaled to me and I looked up as Jeff continued to climb up the building. We typically use multiple wires for every harness as a safety measure.
The Stunt Coordinator looks at the rig and looks up at the building with the wires hanging from the stunt.
CLAIMS ADJUSTER PETERS
(stands)
When the first wire snapped, did the production assistant notice anything about the other wires on the rig?
STUNT COORDINATOR
(points to building)
Jeff was nearly halfway up the building when one of the wires snapped, one of the production assistants was operating the wires for Jeff and the other production assistant was operating the wires for the cameraman.
The Stunt Coordinator walks over to the rig with the wires and points up to the building as he talks to Claims Adjuster Peters.
CLAIMS ADJUSTERS PETERS
(stands)
Where was Mr. Manning on the building when the wires started to snap?
STUNT COORDINATOR (CONT’D)
(points to building)
The stunt on the building also required Mr. Manning to shoot a prop gun loaded with dummy bullets at the other actor leaning out of a window on one of the top floors.
Claims Adjuster Peters writes notes on the document in his leather binder as the Stunt Coordinator continues describing the stunt.
STUNT COORDINATOR
(points to building)
We attached rocks to the side of the office building to allow Mr. Manning to climb more easily, he trained for 3 months on a rock wall to shoot the stunt for the movie.
STUNT COORDINATOR
(points to building)
Jeff was shooting a stunt for Scene #3 – in the scene his character Mr. Panther scales a building to climb up to an office and take a file from one of the computers.
CLAIMS ADJUDSTER PETERS
(stands)
For the stunt on the building, what was Mr. Manning required to do?
STUNT COORDINATOR
(stands)
I’ll show you the equipment, we left the wires as-is for you to examine them for the insurance claim.
