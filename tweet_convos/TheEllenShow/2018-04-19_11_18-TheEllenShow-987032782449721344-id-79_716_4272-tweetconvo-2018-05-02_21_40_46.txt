what does this have to do with Taylor Swift?
I'm assuming he has a crush on her? Or because of the song name, she thinks of Taylor.
Hmm maybe this was on one of her playlists?
Hadn’t thought of that. That’s a possibility.
oh yeah taylor added it onto one of her playlists he tweeted about It awhile ago lmfao
At the start of the video it says Taylor is one of his biggest fans :)
Are we gonna trash on him for making a cover too orrrr

Sovereign over all things,  reminds us that it is the Lord who made the poor and the rich. Besides, both are made in his image. Guaranteeing one's dignity to one who is in need then comes back to glorify one's Creatorhttps://www.leetchi.com/c/solidarite-sans-domicile-fix

It's a nice song, but is it R&B? No shade! Just wondering!
Lmfao
This is the part where the four of us quartet 'Renegade', right? 
I mean, I *do* share a birthday with Tommy Shaw, it's only appropriate. #music #yeehaw
ELLEN, PLEASE!!! I have the dream of living, working and studying in the USA. Love youuuuu
