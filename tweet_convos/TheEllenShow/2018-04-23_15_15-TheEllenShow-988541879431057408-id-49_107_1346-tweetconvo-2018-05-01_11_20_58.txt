I still have my album from my childhood!  It was my absolute favorite!  I brought it everywhere with me, along with my flashing lights “Disco” record player #memories
Here’s 1 of my absolute easy best fave albums: #Tool’s 1993 (debut) studio album: #Undertow, which celebrated its #25thAnniversary! 
I was in the play in 2nd grade 1981!!
I think if the whole world would listen to this album, the world would be a gentler place. 
Awesome! Such a great album and message!
I love Free to Be You and Me! Listened to that record a lot growing up! And I adore That Girl, Marlo Thomas!
You can purchase it here.
I still have my original and my kids who are 23 & 19 were brought up on it. Love it, love it!!  It definitely help shape me into the person I am today! Love to you Marlo Thomas. Love you too Ellen

This little girl is ill & needs medical attention.  She goes to a high poverty school.  Surgery is so delicate that only 5 hospitals do procedure.   Seeing this tweet reminded me about Saint Jude!   I will call them. Read about her issue here :   https://funds.gofundme.com/dashboard
