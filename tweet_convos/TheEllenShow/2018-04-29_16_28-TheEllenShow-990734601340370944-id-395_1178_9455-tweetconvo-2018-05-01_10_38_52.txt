Thank you for meeting with me, this interview should only take an hour or so.

I can’t think of anyone, but there could be someone with an issue. Jeff has worked on a lot of films over the years for Summit Studios.

There are actors, who are more difficult to work with than others, but I’ve never had an issue while working with Jeff. We’ve worked on two other films and have not had any issues with them.

CLAIMS ADJUSTER MATTHEWS
(sits at desk)
The expert is a Stunt Coordinator, who works with Nation Star Insurance on cases like this where there is possible negligence and/or homicide. Can you think of any reason someone may want to harm or kill Jeff Manning?
STUNT COORDINATOR
(sits in chair)
All of the production assistants carry the same toolkit, but I don’t think any of them would have a motive for cutting Jeff Manning’s wires.

INT. LIPMAN GREENBERG LLP LAW FIRM – NORTH HOLLYWOOD OFFICE
OFFICER BLOCH (CONT’D)
(sits at desk)
The NYPD car will pick you up from La Guardia Airport, I’ll see you in a week.

Officer Bloch hangs up the phone and clicks the send button to email the link from Nation Star Insurance to Detective Robinson.

FADE OUT
OFFICER BLOCH
(sits at desk)
The expert’s report for Nation Star Insurance is on their website, I’ll send you the link to read it.

Officer Bloch logs into his email and finds the email link from Nation Star Insurance to read the expert’s report.
DETECTIVE ROBINSON
(sits at desk)
I will read over the expert’s report before I come to NYC to examine the evidence on the set. You should also request the employee files for the Stunt Coordinator, Assistant Director and the Director.
OFFICER BLOCH
(sits at desk)
I will send you the expert’s report for Nation Star Insurance and look up the employee files for the two production assistants, as well as the Stunt Coordinator.
DETECTIVE ROBINSON
(sits at desk)
The dispute from the previous film ended up being the motive for the homicide.
DETECTIVE ROBINSON
(sits at desk)
In my other case, we found additional information in the employee file that helped us make an arrest. We found that the production assistant had worked on another film with the actor and they had a dispute.
That was great 
OFFICER BLOCH
(sits at desk)
One of them was operating the wires for the cameraman wearing the camera vest, but they both carry the same toolkit and would have had the same access to Jeff Manning’s wires before he climbed the building for the stunt.
DETECTIVE ROBINSON
(sits at desk)
So, you can already connect the cuts on the wires to one of the production assistants that was assigned to the rig by the Stunt Coordinator.
OFFICER BLOCH
(sits at desk)
According to the stunt expert, Tim Gallagher, the wires were cut with a blade that would be on a Swiss Army knife. All of the production assistants carry a standard toolkit, which includes a Swiss Army knife.
Officer Bloch flips through the pages of the expert’s report and stops on one of the pages, he quickly scans the paragraph about the wires.
DETECTIVE ROBINSON
(sits at desk)
I’ll take a look at the rigs on the Mr. Panther set and review the timeline of events the day of Jeff Manning’s fall from the building. Chances are there are additional details that will be discovered during questioning.
OFFICER BLOCH
(sits at desk)
When you come to NYC, we’ll go over to the Mr. Panther set in Midtown for you to see the rig. The broken wires are in the evidence lab here at the Midtown precinct.
DETECTIVE ROBINSON (CONT’D)
(sits at desk)
In this previous case, we discovered new evidence that led to the arrest of one of the production assistants. Stunts are coordinated between multiple people, so there is a strong chance more than one person is involved.
Detective Robinson scrolls through one of the interviews and reads the section of the interview over the phone to Officer Bloch.
DETECTIVE ROBINSON
(sits at desk)
During the investigation, I interviewed production assistants and the Stunt Coordinator. We arrested one of the production assistants and the Stunt Coordinator, who both had a vendetta against the actor in the film.
DETECTIVE ROBINSON
(sits at desk)
In one of my previous cases, I investigated a homicide that involved a stunt with the rig, the actor was killed while shooting a flying scene with the wires.
Detective Robinson types on the keyboard and clicks on one of the case files on his computer, he scrolls through the contents and opens a PDF document.
