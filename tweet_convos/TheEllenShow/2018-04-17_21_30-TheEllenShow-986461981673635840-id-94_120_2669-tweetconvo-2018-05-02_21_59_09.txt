There should be a police composite sketch

Of a certain weather "expert",  though that may be a stretch.

He is a groundhog named Phil, who saw his shadow

And said winter would last only six more weeks or so

'Twas a fraudulent forecast; may that rodent they catch.

I can’t understand why Jenna had protestors at her book Q&A at school campus.  Can you give your fans of this cute show any input on this matter. Scary for Jenna.


Hard but I gotta figure out how to raise funds and I swear if can work again,  (radio announcer and breathing don't work) try to be optimistic, am so afraid.  just hoped you have people you know but someone have to trust me to repay.  6788005010 Connie Charlyne Morrison love hugs



ELLEN MY QUEEN
Dear Ellen,  do you know of place that help pay for lung procedures that would give me my life span back.  Its only 5 years old so insurance do pay.  My parents and baby sister died from this,  sadly was not available then. Great reviews.  Was given a year feb.  Of 16. Fighting
She lied to her. Fans
This episode made a reference to abuse.  Why do people think these things are funny?  Those who have been there sure don’t.
Dear miss Ellen I'm in need of help trying to repair my mom house and my sister that resides with her that have a special need. I'm reaching out to you for any type of help possible. May God bless you
