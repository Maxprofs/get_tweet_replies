“I was just trying to show the world how I got pregnant in the first place”. 
She's literally got enough money to buy her own. It's almost like you're shouting out another child internet star....
@Mariiaaax
Man I love this woman, her personality is so refreshing @iamcardib
I love you show Ellen
ah, the old lambo talk there's a place full of it! it is called the world of #cryptocurrency -- your first association is #bitcoin -- your second should be @SubstratumNet because it may protect your free access to information on the internet once #NetNeutrality is gone

Am a Professional Passenger........
I need a friend like Ellen
When she said "I'm a professional passenger"
Elle, what the heck. She has enough money to buy one. How about you hook up a girl with major student debt instead?
One of the many reasons you are love by many, Ellen, is because you don't discriminate on any level.
@OliviaKeesaer
I don't know anything about CardiB; I don't listen to Rap music, but she seems very genuine-no pretense. According comments, this is one of the many reasons people like her.
Hilarious!!! @cardib you girl crack me up! 
Urus is on its way to the United States. In the meantime, why don't you join us at the exclusive #LamborghiniLounge in NYC? @TheEllenShow https://lam.bo/loungeNY

“i’m a professional passenger” 

Damn I love CardiB....she's chilled

Ellen I think Cardi B can afford to pay for her car. What about the people who can’t even buy a used car?
 this video is why I fell inlove with her in the first place
@CNGWENYA2
I love Ellen's sarcasm so much .
I just want a Ford F-250 4x4 with a heavy duty tow hitch...
I like this girl 
Hook me up any car Ellen  . I don't own any car. Can't even dream of owning a  @Lamborghini .
Noo nooo
@TheEllenShow tell them that I’m your friend !!!
Me too I’m a friend of Ellen @Lamborghini @TheEllenShow ?

Omg, she is so funny.  I L♡ve it!
Wow i live in a completely different world than this sadly
@Lamborghini  yea me too!!! Me and @TheEllenShow go waaaaay back!!! Yea and I use to do @iamcardib hair when she was 12 mmmmhmmm
Krrrrrrr
Hook me up instead, Cardi can actually afford one lmao

This girl is out of the world!!!! Her level of honesty coupled with innocence is mind blogging but don’t be fooled she’s a bad bitch
Omg @TheEllenShow I just need 2 years of tuition funds for my little sister and I'm good or at least a year
Americans should be so proud they made innocent 15yr old girls twerk at their homes by subliminally training them. 
These sounds that @iamcardib makes is so annoying and childish. Grow up! Little kids do that, how old are you? 6!
@iamcardib  lemonish donuts, you are welcome

Ellen needs to stop helping rich people get things they can afford and help me lmao 

@channcraigg
I want to be her so badly
