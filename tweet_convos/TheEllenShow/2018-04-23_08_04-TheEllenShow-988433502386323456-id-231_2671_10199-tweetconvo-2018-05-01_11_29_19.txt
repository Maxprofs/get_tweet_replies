Just like Black Panther I will support this movie. I like that POC are getting movies with high prodzction values and roles that are not stereotypical.
Do the rich, sassy, sashay walk.... cheers!

Glad to see @ConstanceWu get roles in stuff. She's great on the show and it's good seeing someone in Hollywood not sticking up for that idiot Casey Affleck
She spoke out of ignorance on Casey.  The smear merchants peddled the bare lawyer written allegations for $, and buried the multiple sworn evidence filed in court discrediting the claims (extortion and more):
You can chose love, but you can’t chose family!
I wish I was rich so I can help out others
