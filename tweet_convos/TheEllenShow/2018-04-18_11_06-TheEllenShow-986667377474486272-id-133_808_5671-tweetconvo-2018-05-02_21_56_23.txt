So glad you bleeped her, I had *no* idea what those responses were.  #sarcasm
I can’t believe some words are still not allowed to say on television in America. You can buy a gun, but you can’t say PENIS!!!
Or butt...
Echt hè....
Het blijft verbazingwekkend...
@Vandana_Sivadas !!! Amy!

I love your song!
@JaclynA13 I love her

Me neither. A very XXX rated #BurningQuestions
AMY Schumer is SOOO Funny!  I love her!! I had a down morning before I saw her and she boosted me right out of it into belling laughs!  You say what I’m thinking but don’t say it out loud.  I LOVE YOU GIRL!  And Congratulations on getting MARRIED!!! Your GIF
Well, you can't really hear what she's sayig with all these *beeeps* going on. So, I guess you'r safe. Even for American TV.
What exactly were the words? English is not my first language i was not able to guess, except the 
I’m going to say the bleeped words were: butt, head,  , 
Oh thanks. I’m going to watch again and replace the bleeped for those words

Omg I'm dying. 
Amy is pure genuin gold! She is brilliantly intelligent, ingenious even, fearless, energetic, quick minded, hilarious, beautiful, crazy honest and positivity radiating force. Asking her answering those questions is definitely looking for trouble. :-)
Is this her mom?
Her mum is sitting in the audience.
I'm dying 
watching her @netflix special
I regret I don’t know who this woman is, but I really like her! You make a great double act  That would have happily gone out sans beeps here (UK)! (Amazed you can’t even say penis?! It’s not a rude word. What time does your show air?)
Nnnn9jnnjjjnnnnnnj
