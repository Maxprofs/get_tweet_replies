Love @kelly_clarkson and you too @TheEllenShow .

I love Meagan 

I cant stop thinking about, loving and fighting for her and to end the stigma. 

Until my last breath.

I am #FightingForMeagan
She will grow & heal faster with ppl on her side
I would love to see U on tour But not yet! I spent all my money on @Pink tickets. You could show up 2 her last LA show and sing a song or 2 or 3 together 
My favorite song by her omg
I love @kelly_clarkson but canâ€™t stand Ellen! Ellen like others libs trash you if you view anything different then they do! @TheEllenShow
Dam this woman's voice is incredible!!
I've been #teamKelly since she was an American idol contestant. I think this beautiful song shows how much she has grown as a woman and singer. 
ugh... How can anyone not love her??? Man she still get's to me and have loved her since I saw her on Amercian Idol during auditions. You go girl and never look backðŸ•†
Wow! She sounds amazing! She lost weight too! Love her on the voice!

Never heard her sing a song that I didn't like....she is awesome!
Would love to see her and @Pink do something together. Both are great ladies and have beautiful voices.
Kelly is a phenomenon! She has it all....fabulous voice, absolutely adorable, great family and so much fun on The Voice! I love her, too! Been a fan since the beginning! 
Did she spank you?   Oh that's just for defenseless children...

Omg Kelly is too cute!!  I love her spunk and energy she is so humble I seen her stop a concert to pick up a cute baby and gush and her reaction to the  crowd screaming her song was priceless!!   I would watch Kelly talk lol... We are now re watching you 
Fantastic performance. Cool vibe, but not totally loving the arrangement though @jasonhalbert Hope we get the original beautiful arrangement back for #thevoice
Omg!!!!! Wow , she gave me goosebumps!!!! Kelly Clarkson you are a power house!!! Beautiful!!!

Yes Hunny!!! 
We need a male take on this sentiment. We get jukeboxes and I'm Over You and I'll Think Of Something. I guess that's our lot in life, though. I'm sorry I missed this the first time, but thanks for sharing it...
Oops!  Nvm, ladies. I just remembered I have The Smiths, I'll just see myself out. 
Justice for #IDontThinkAboutYou @971zht @my995 tell me, whatâ€™s the goal here by not adding this GEM of a song??? Give the people good music  Iâ€™m sure your currently overplayed artists would agree. All good music should be played. Thereâ€™s room for everyone in pop.
I loved everything about this
We love you @kelly_clarkson 
Watching Kelly Clarkson on The Ellen (most awsome women I've never met lol ) can I get a heck yea! For Ellen to co host with Kelly !
I loves me some Kelly
Oh man I love this song! Love you both!!

"Kelly-chan..."
"E-Ellen-senpai..."
