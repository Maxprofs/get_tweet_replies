Where is Getaway car and delicate?
Yes . X 115 times nice job
Ummm OOTW? 109? There must be two Out Of The Woods!
Ok @CatitudeSwift will be happy with No2 - I am happy with No6. Other than that Im mostly in the late teens early 20s!
I SAW OUT OF THE WOODS AT 109, GASPED, AND THREW MY PHONE OUT OF SHEER TERROR. HOW DARE YOU ALLOW THESE LIES TO BE PUBLISHED. #FakeNews
Okay, I’m hearing in the twitter replies that All Too Well made the #1 spot (which is exactly where it should be), but I’m too afraid to look at the article again to confirm because that position of Out of the Woods burns my eyes.
@taylorswift13  DILE A LAS FEMINISTAS QUE SE VAN A QUEDAR SIN ORO.
All Taylor swift songs are top 10 hits as far as I’m concerned
I agree with 23-1 but I’m surprised Stay Stay Stay is so high on the list!
All too well - best song ever. Totally deserves #1 :)
They put "You Belong With Me" at 49! That's my favorite Taylor Swift song :(
its so very nice 
@conallblack do you agree with the ranking?!
FOLLOW MY TUMBLR @TAYLORISFEARLESS
All Too Well is my fave! Deserves no.1, deserved to be a single.
Here’s to 115 more! 
GOP budget cuts $1.5 trillion from medicare/medicaid. Call your Congressman to say NO to tax cuts for the 1%.
So pretty 
Also left out some songs.  Where is "I'd Lie" for instance??

NO tax cuts for corporations until ALL superfund sites are cleaned up!!!!!!
This is soooo not right!!! Haha.
I love you 
Dua Lipa makes Taylor Swift look & sound like an Xfactor rookie. What a great voice. @DUALIPA @taylorswift13

Rolling Stones is old and out of touch. She has talent in singing, song writing and business. Put the bud down and recalculate.
I'm still not sure about which of #TaylorSwift #outfit from #LWYMMD #video I #like more
#fashion #style #music #clothes #sexy #moda #estilo
Why do they hate Taylor’s Christmas album? She has original songs and great covers that are absolutely stunning.
She's the best tho don't rank Queen T 

My little brother and I love this music video. 
@taylorswift13 my 8 year old Mylee adores you and your music here she is recreating her version of you in “look what you made me do”!!!

I have to disagree with some selections. But overall the list is a 5 of 10

#taylorswift #taylurking 
Like Really? 
You put Bad Blood At the END? 
It's one of the best from 1989!
I honestly just care about what Taylor Swift does to help children in USA To become More Protected than Pedofiles in this country
Who you need to date:
this is taking me years to get through (so many songs i forgot about!) and i am not sad about it
Mine: 5) speak now 4) Holy Ground 3)New Romantics 2) All to Well 1) IKYWT
@robsheff- 
Wanted to give it a chance, tho. Out of the woods at 109?
Saw Bad Blood at number 115 and I was already done with that shit.
Cool!
