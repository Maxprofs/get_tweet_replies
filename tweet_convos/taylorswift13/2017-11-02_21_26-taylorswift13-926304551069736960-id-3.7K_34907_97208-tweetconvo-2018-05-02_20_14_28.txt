I love this song so much Taylor. It's literally goals. Everything you do just amazes me. I love you Taylor
love Taylor's smile
When this came out, I just sobbed in my bed for an hour. Such hideous crying, puffy eyes, hiccups, the whole deal. Call it what you want, I’ll call it the song I didn’t realize I’d been waiting for till you gave it to us. Thank you for that, I’ll never stop being grateful 
I like this song, I just wish I was the one thing you did right!! and you wanted to help me build a performance church!!  but either way, i'm gonna build it!!! Cause God is awesome!!! being loved never goes out of style!!
