Happy Birthday Girl!!!

MEXICO IS WAITING FOR YOU
Queen
damn being broke sucks
HAPPY BIRTHDAY 
Come to Brazil 
i love it
Why not do a surprise show at the Morris Performance Arts Center, in South Bend, Indiana?  A smaller venue than you usually play, yes, but an intimate one, and you'll sell it out in minutes, and the fans will love it!
Taylor,Welcome to China!!!
I LOVE YOU

COME TO BRAZIL!

J’attends des dates pour l’Europe moi  (autre que UK et Irelande)
Tu rêves 
Chuuuuuuut, c’est beau de rêver, elle était en Belgique pour l’album Speak Now, wesh 
Y’a 30 ans 


And I walking in the Spirit in the Kingdom of God and stuff which here pretty soon I want to stay in the Kingdom for good
What Is the Kingdom of God?

“The kingdom of God” is also called “the kingdom of heaven” in the Bible, since it rules from heaven. (Mark 1:14, 15;Matthew 4:17, King James Version)
Luke 17:20-21
Jesus was God’s royal representative, the one anointed by God for the kingship; hence, it could be said that “the Kingdom” was in their midst. He also had authority to perform works manifesting God’s kingly power and to prepare candidates for his coming Kingdom.—Lu 22:29-30.

I just was trying to figure out the best way to explain how I experienced the kingdom of God in my life

I found out in 2015 that we have to not be doing any sins to really have the Holy Spirit
I hope Taylor come to Thailand for reputation Stadium Tour @taylorswift13 
Good
I really hope that I could come in one of your concertsthat's why I'll study hard and earn money to see you wish me luck on the road to become a good student,and continue to create good music, Love you

I've been going to every concert in Nashville.  However, I was disappointed that I can't rip my arm and leg off to go this year. I'm shocked at how the ticket prices have tripled in the last 3 years. I'll have a sad daughter this year.
Happy birthday Taylor
