You are a true Class Act. Kind of you to send flowers to Vegas Police. You are awesome!!
Those flowers you sent the police station in Vegas were so sweet! 
It's a shame that a kind-hearted person like you has to live in this evil world where atrocities like this happen. Stay safe & Love you 
You're not helpless. You have huge influence & a gigantic platform. Talk to your fan base about gun control.
Why should she have to speak to her fans about gun control? She's an artist, not a politician. Maybe she wants to keep her views to herself
#thatswhy
oh my Gosh stars have the fans who are influenced by them and their opinion,  and respect them- such a fantastic idea -  #taylorswift
#thatswhy
We should enact tighter restrictions on#GunControl in order to prevent such horrifying events from taking place in the future.#GunControlNow
And what law wud have prevented it? He passed bkgrnd chks, purchased legally. Chicago has strictest gun laws in the US. How's that working?
Remove guns from the #LasVegasMassacre equation. Then, what do you have? Answer: A lot less (possibly no) lives lost. #GunControlNow
20 days ‘till @taylorswift13 #reputation album comes up and we still waiting for her to reveal all of the tracklist. #TS6 !!!
Iloveyou
I LOVE YOU
YOU ARE RIGHT
I think the government should regulate guns more strictly
Thank you Taylor....it's just a terrible act that should never, ever, be committed. People are just looking for a good time but it mightve-
Been their last....
You guys can never be satisfied with Taylor, y'all act like her tweeting about every thing will suddenly make world problems go away
my god i love you
i thought u were talking to me :,(
#حق_باطل_نشود یعنی گرچه ما در مقابل لابی متمول نفتی تنهاییم اما #خدا_باماست
#دانشگاه_نفت، #آزمون_دیوان_عدالت است
What about Puerto Rico?
De méxico no twitteaste nada 
Porque le vale maíz acéptalo

To people asking her to speak about guns:SHE IS NOT THE PRESIDENT.SHE IS NOT A MEMBER OF THE PARLIAMENT
Spam those who can actually ban guns
u have a platform of 85mill there ARE words; like "that was domestic terrorism" or "pass restrictive access laws"
آقا عهد پیشکش زنگنه خان، به رای دیوان تمکین کن 
#دانشگاه_نفت 
#آزمون_دیوان_عدالت
Want to help? Refuse to perform in US until a gun massacre can be prevented at your show. That will effect the economy & create change.
we love you～
I’m just here to see all the idiots telling her what to post

i love you babe 
#PrayForTheWorld

Please convey sorrow in a song. Your ability to do so is great and compassionate. Help #USA heal.
Yeah that would be good
to all people writing tweets like “you should talk about”. you should remind she’s a human being and be entitled to stay silent if she wants
although u dont believe it, nothing would change if she talked because there’re problems in the world she cant solve. PLEASE LEAVE HER ALONE
YOU SAID TAYLOR CAN'T COME TO THE PHONE RIGHT NOW THEN R U DEAD BECAUSE YOUR TAYLOR THERE IS NO OLD BECAUSE YOU R TAYLOR SWIFT
forever wishing taylor will notice me #november11th

Maybe push for gun control?

you're not "helpless" USE YOUR POWER to influence voters #guncontrol
@TheEllenShow u my heart 
@taylorswift13  tweeted ... they blamed her, hated her, criticized her.. @taylorswift13  sent flower to police dept.. No one talked abt 

And what about México? You didn't care ? Sad gurl, sad.
Twit paratwit parano veamos la violencia o desgracia como algo maravilloso no caigamos en eso
Kind of you！
I love you so much. :( When will the madness stop?
we love you more than the world
Here are some words you could use 'I support stronger gun control' - like what we did in Aus post Port Arthur massacre
Ok only 50 people killed what about thousands and thousands of people Iraq Syria Yemen Muslims in borma or they are not humans shame of all
I'm disappointed in you. Mexico happened to worse things and you did not write anything.
Wey y cuando se estaba acabando México ni un pinche costal de frijol enviaste. Te amo pero eres bien pinché racista alv
Seas mamon bato!!!!

@block_chain_one - Want to know who is really Satoshi Nakamoto? Sign and soon the truth will conquer the world

Nena I need to see your face before Nov 10th
Thankfully most of your haters can't afford to listen to your music or go to a concert. Ignore them. They insist on wanting to divide. 
There are no words to express the helplessness and sorrow my broken heart feels for the victims in Burma and their families.
300 people killed by drunk drivers, 400 opiate deaths, 350 by guns, ALL last week, no body cares about them WHY?
Taylor , your the best person wishing the best and doing the best
i love much
爱你没事我们会支持你 i am Chinese

I know it soo sad, My hearts go out to all of u who was a victim or experienced this

precious...life is but a vapor & times like this show us indeed how quickly that vapor vanishes. But is it really gone? Their lives will linger in our memories forever. So tragic. May we all find peace with our souls & try to  spread  Love you Taylor, Eternally, Lilybeth
