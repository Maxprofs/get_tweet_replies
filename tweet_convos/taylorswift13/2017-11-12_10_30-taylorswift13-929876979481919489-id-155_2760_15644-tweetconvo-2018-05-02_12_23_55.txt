Hi Taylor;

Great show ladies @taylorswift13 @TiffanyHaddish
OH GOD!! Now, she'll be "honored" with a statue at Madam Tussauds wax museum. Who actually seen her, about 100 liberals.
Tiffany is awesome. Tay Tay is a fembot so she’s pretty perfect. Weird baggy shorts though
TAYLOR SWIFT ENDED YOU
Taylor retweets the same magazine she has shaded with her own magazine release!!! Damn girl!! This umbrella is getting wider! Love you T. Swizzle!! #Slay_Them_Dragons
i loooove the reunion
Tay
You are sum character.........
She nailed it. Can’t stop loving her


Great job girl!  Great dress!!!
No one tear down these talented women. They both did great
Something is up with tswift and the baggy clothes. Still think she had a boob job late last year. Keeping them camouflaged for some reason.
She didn't even sing 
Yes she did.
QUEEN SLAYLOR SWIFT KILLED IT LAST NIGHT!!!! 
Yaaaassss! 
Is it just me or at the end of call it what you want video Taylor's face just screams "I'm back bitches and I know you love me"
This is why we can't have nice things. Tiffany Haddish slayed. Not denying Taylor's greatness last night, but why couldn't you lead your article with Tiffany? She kicked ass out there but yeah, let's have the white woman up front.
Good job
Taylor, you did amazing  #TaylorOnSNL
I only see one talented legend
We don’t put women against each other, there were two amazingly talented women on that show last night!
