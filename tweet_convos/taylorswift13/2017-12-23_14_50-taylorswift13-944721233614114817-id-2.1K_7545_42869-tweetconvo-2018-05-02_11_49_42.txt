I got the same answer and I'm so sad :(
Same
This disappoints me because I really wanted to get the app and it didn't even work on my tablet which is a Samsung tablet!
Why did they released it when almost all off the fans android devices are not supported they should really need to fix this
Yeah they should! I am so disappointed
Me either im so sad hope they fix it soon
I HOPE IT WORKS CAUSE WHENEVER I DOWNLOAD IT WITH VPN IT KEPT GIVING ME THIS
Same here emma
Sameeeee
Sameee X2
I can't even find it
Here's the link
w h y ????
SAME!!??
SAME 
SAME YO
at least y'all didn't have to download it and then lose hope at the last second
That was me my heart sank
I think it available only in some country's all I know definitely not in my country it available 
its available world wide just use the link they posted to find it
Back to the drawing board ..lot of fan can download or use with Android. ?..
g-F
poxa Taylor o app é muito grande :((
Promote End Game please
The lack of promotion this era is unfortunate
She is literally leting end game fade away. It was top 10 on itunes two weeks ago, now it's out of the top 40.  and it has already peaked on radio.
It hasn't even come close to peaking on radio though.
FINALLY DOWNLOADING I'VE WAITED SO LONG FOR IT
Did it run to your device? Cause my phone always said it's not supported. 
Its not working on mine 
Same same. 
I hope this isnt permanent 
Like I hope they fix this
They have to fix this. 
Dude yeah 
Hopefully they read the comments on their post and see what some people are saying
Yeah yeah.
I LOVE IT
Hi Taylor I hope you have a wonderful Christmas  I hope you have a safe new year I want to meet you you are my idol since I was a teenager

SAME!! don't worry you aren't alone Lol
...
OMG SAME SIS SAMEEEE
Yeah... me to sis
please make a lighter version that is compatible with all devices, many swifties just as I do not have the swift life compatible phone :(
God I'm downloading it!!!!
Is it available in U.S.?  Can’t tell by the tweet and I don’t have an Android. :/
The US already had it on itunes
I was wondering for Android.
I'm from Hong Kong and I can 
No worries
If you have xaomi phone then you would have to lol
Dude go to sleep its 4:30am!xD
Lol
I'm having so much fun!!! This was a great gift for Christmas...  i love it #TheSwiftLife
How did you do it!? Mine says device isn't supported. What phone do you have?
I have the Samsung Galaxy S8+
How much space do you still have on internal storage?
32GB
Not all internal memory, how much you've left?
32GB all internal memory is 64GB
Woww that's huge! Maybe we need to clear some more space thanks!
Best christmas gift
@taylorswift13: It would be great if you would call DYFS at 732-908-5942, and ask for Gracie Santangelo, she looks like you Taylor, and she is a very sweet, adorable child. Her mommy can't work. If you ask for Valerie Corabie, and then Gracie wishing her Happy Holidays.
It seems that this app doesn't support my phone 
I'm coming
Follow me!!  darkestswiftiss
I'm so happy!!
still stuck on checking assets screen FIX IT

I've done several things for this. I've deleted apps, created new Google play acc and downloaded an app for VPN. My efforts didn't worked tho
Wth is this?????? It's stuck here now. Now we have to buy new phone to use it or what???
Whyyyyyy x
I SPUN AROUND SO FAST IN MY CHAIR TO GRAB MY TABLET THAT MY HEAD STARTED GETTING LIGHTHEADED
This is getting really frustrating. It doesn't work on my tablet either. Everything is so friggin exclusive. What do I need to do to get this app. I would pay for it if it would let me. Only thing I can do now us maybe in my WiFi tv. Someone  please HELP!!!!! @
SAAAAAME HUHU Im really frustrated and everything
A lot of people are having this issue. I feel like I'm missing so much. I hope it gets fi ed soon
Yah... I wish too
@taylorswift13 let's get something #Straight there's nothing #Straight or #Swift about @NathanialBlaine not to mention already have #FineLine & 1st time your life you'll just have to wait. Unless of course talk my #Attorney @stiteslaw & you're already in her bed when I get home.
@taylorswift13 think you've gotten good #Acting all #GrownUp & #Bad I see through you & your millions nothin on my #Billions & your pop songs nothin on my #PsychedelicTimeMachines I play music for #God not middle school girls we all have an audience if you want mine learn to #Bow
@taylorswift13 see that? Called #BillionDollar #Leash & #Collar what my #Attorney wears @stiteslaw so when we out public no one notices residue her #Necklace made entirely #Pearls thats thing about #FineLine I could spend forever with Stephanie so you'll have #WorkForIt #WorkHard
@taylorswift13 so if you want #FastTracked head that #FineLine maybe my #Attorney @stiteslaw take you into #Custody you have the #RightRemainSilent any #Moan or #Sigh you make can & most certainly will used to hold you down against side of her #Bed you have a right to #MyAttorney
@taylorswift13 put your hands behind your back that's #CorpusDelicti means body of the crime #ActusReus guilty act #AdColligendaBona like to collect the goods #FeraeNaturae thats wild animals by nature #LocusDelicti like place of the crime #LocusPoenitentiae like place repentance
@taylorswift13 my point here isn't try & seduce or sleep with you I already did that it's surprisingly easy my purpose is take you home to #Church not that #Cornbread #CookieCutter everything #NicePeachy but that raw fill you from the inside make you moan for mercy me not to stop
@taylorswift13 you notice there's two #Angels in these paintings you & my #Attorney @stiteslaw you want to #Come home to #God well for that to happen we need do away with all the rules, boundaries, inhibitions. You have to learn be #TouchedByAngel ways you've never dared or felt
@taylorswift13 problem here something been avoiding your entire life about #Control aint no #Baptist everything gonna be ok nobody gets hurt got all figured out @VaticanCultura #TibetanVajrayana which you ain't even ever heard of #NoRules #God don't got #Rules neither #NateBlaine
This is great news! I’ve got on my iPhone from App Store but many friends are looking for this for their Androids. Is this available in all countries?
It maybe can't use in China.
