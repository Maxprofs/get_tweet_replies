Rest in peace, Old Taylor, and for that matter New Taylor, because 'Reputation' is New New Taylor. Read Rob Sheffield's review http://rol.st/2yLoN5k  
Idk who the old Taylor is. Idk who the new Taylor is. IDK ANY TAYLORS. I know that @Eminem and #Revival is going to crush #repuatation
She has sold 1M+ alreay. The best selling album of 2017 I dont think that she cares about Eminem
already
BeSt SeLLinG ALBum #lmao wait til tomorrow. And 1 M ?! Talk when you've sold 200+ M #KingMathers
Reputation outsold revival 7x lmaoo
Ha it should have. Come back and talk once @taylorswift13 is the best selling artist of a decade
Oof someone is pressed because they got called out. Come back when you stop supporting Donald Duck
Pressed? I won't b coming back then #Trump2020

I wouldn’t know b/c my preorder never arrived. All stores are closed. And it’s not on Apple Music. 
It's on iTunes . You have to go there instead of Apple Music
itunes are apparently lagging because of all the downloads
They are pushing out as many pre-orders as they can so it’s laggy.
This happened with my red preorder too. 1989 actually came like two days early which is why I gave it another try for #reputation but I won’t preorder her next one. Its easier to go to the store in person.
I love this album and obsessed with the track "Delicate". It' on repeat and never gets old. But again I loved always loved her music.

Rest in peace NEW taylor swift
Amazing
November 10th... The day when Taylor releases her album. And also the day when Sims 4 Cats and Dogs comes out.
I love it too!  I’m addicted to it. Will probably be the only thing I play for the whole next year. Can’t even decide which song I love best!
@robsheff I love this article! Very well-written!!

OMG THIS IS BRAND NEW INFORMATION
you better stan
Ps i loved snl it was litty

U really doing this?
What do u guys see in Taylor Swift #Music she doesn’t sing she doesn’t dance I’m confused  
Are we listening to the same album?
I just got my CD today! It's Amazing and I  every song! I'm 59 but your music is ageless! I saw u once w/daughter your age. I know I sound like a geek but I'm in awe! Is it OK to say what I just said? #1 Fan 
#EMABiggestFansTaylorSwift
U r very nice person it seems like keep it that way
I have mixed feelings about this.....I am glad you have reviewed the rest of the album. Look What You Made Me Do made me concerned about Taylor quite a bit. Glad she has been updating via Twitter.
You are amazing!!!
Sweet jesus, i haven't heard it. I need to hear it  like right now

You have great tastes 
Every song is better than the last!
Eu não
yeah it is: https://youtu.be/_CYsKd2AcOw 
There wasn’t any thing wrong with any version of Taylor, I hope she learns how to meld them all together
I LIVE FOR REPUTATION AND I LOVE IT TO HEAVEN AND BACK!!! I already know all the words. DWOHT and End Game are complete bops and New Years Day is making me cry. Taylor is a genius who makes constant masterpieces and she owns my heart. . @taylorswift13
I miss old Taylor
I wouldn't it's garbage.
Pretty sure responses to this tweet R bots  -

𝔯𝔢𝔭𝔲𝔱𝔞𝔱𝔦𝔬𝔫
I'm surprised she chose the singles she chose! Haha Thoughts??? Because the other songs are AMAZING! Is that a strategy?
I am going to get this entire review painted on my walls. See my Twitter for my not-as-eloquent review. Also Hi Merry Swiftmas miss you
This review is EVERYTHING
I’m also probably getting “Make no mistake, this girl's love affair with drama is alive and well” screenprinted onto a T-shirt
I do too
I think I might only doing first listen making my notes like a psycho
Why in my app. Store, it still on pre-order? And it will be expected on 12 nov?? Isnt it supposed to be released?
“Nothing good starts in a getaway car.” #reputation
