Y no hay de Lorde? 
Im lost diplo and tay had beef?
Diplo started the drama by saying tay needs butt implant. Taylor doesn't reply and stay away from the drama. Lorde defended her
On the other hand,lorde is fris with diplo. And ya'all need to stop asking her where is this song bc this is her fav list
Ohhh ok.... I didn't know about all this thing. Thanks for the update.

It doesn't sound very exciting because we don't know what it means
I'll find some of the cool stuff on my USB to show you later because I'm going to work on my resume for the rest of the day
The real idea I wanted to tell you that is even more important than the run/walk technique
Imagine if the all the songs in the playlist spelt out a secret message!
Knowing her probably. She does like to hide clues in plain sight :)
THAT'S MY GIRL !
YASS QUEEN
I can just say get out another music video and I don't have do actually do any work to say that
MALIBUUUUUUUUUU @MileyCyrus 
I should be doing really good a year from now

That scripture is really cool once you experience what Jesus is talking about there the scriptures at the beginning of Luke 13 are talking
LIAM GALLAGHER YAS !
And then a Bible study mid week maybe on a Wednesday is close to the same you might be studying the Bible even more than at Church service
They aren't all that exciting anyways "The Art Of War" by Sun Tzu, "How To Work In Stained Glass" Second Edition by Anita & Seymour Isenberg
@hernameisbanks yas queen
about what to add next or how your voice sounds and make a lot of those decisions based on how you feel
It sounds really pop music but you should know its a hit and thats what I want for you in the future

bad reputationnnnnnnn
Its really nice to have things working in life and taking care of your health and have a good career doing what you love and having money
Let your feelings determine where to go with the song next while trying to keep the formalities within reason
YASS @hernameisbanks obviouslyyyyy

that you eventually find a time that works for you and try to workout at the same time every day that was a tip I learned recently
You played your entire "Reputation" album for fans in the U.K.?

#come to homecoming with me?
I had them on just now for the past 30 mins. and then took them off and now my teeth are noticeably whiter and there's 14 applications
Then after we die we will really be in heaven if you were living in the Kingdom of Heaven here on earth first
This is fantastic wow
When I choose colors I go strictly by emotion I choose colors by emotion for the most part and with some logic

I'm using photos and making a grid right now because I was talking with an old lady at the library a couple years ago

I'm want to open your eyes to what the Kingdom of God is from a biblical perspective its an everyday thing but you can see it differently

That depression and fear I believe is from sins that we do and when you stop doing the sin the depression and fear lift away with the sin
I really like that song "Amused" by Hunger

I love almost all of them too
Não acredito que tem Cigarettes After Sex muito bom gosto Taylor continue escutando essa maravilha 
and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men,
If you made it a priority to work out every day then you'd be less likely to forget that you need to work out
And Jesus uses parables to try to explain what it is because its really simple once you understand what it is but it does so many things
The emotion in the music thats what you need and I make really emotional artwork if you want to talk sometime about how to get emotion
Hey, Tay, just thought you should know Mikenactor made a disgusting parody with your song on youtube.Its awful.
Can you give me a link for download the song ready for it?

You know how everyone talks about the body of light and how to get the body of light? The fastest way to get the body of light is to repent
You could try to drag it out over time like Michael Jackson and maybe release 2 more singles over 2018 and 2019
