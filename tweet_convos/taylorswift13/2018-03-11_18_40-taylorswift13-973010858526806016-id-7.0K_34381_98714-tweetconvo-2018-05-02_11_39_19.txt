Really like the time he said “so what a couple of kids died, there are millions more” referring to the parkland shooting?

Dear T,
Thanks for making my friends dreams come true. I hope one day you can make mine come true. Britt
The thoughts of Britt’s brain: imagine if @taylorswift13 were to come back on Twitter right now & she decided to attack a post of mine?...I would sink & drown & die.  @taylorswift13 @taylornation13 #TaylorSwiftDelicate #DelicateMusicVideo
Chicago can't wait for June 1st to dance to Delicate!.
So many of you are waking up to find that @taylorswift13 liked your posts. Nothing makes me happier to see smiles on all Swifties faces. Taylor is living her best life to the fullest & taking us along for the ride. I have never felt so grateful @taylornation13 #DelicateMusicVideo
MY FAVORITE THING ABOUT THIS VIDEO IS THIS: THIS IS THE REAL TAYLOR. IF YOU KNOW TAYLOR YOU KNOW THIS IS WHO SHE IS DEEP DOWN AND ONE THING SHE NEVER LOST SIGHT OF. #DelicateVideoOutNow

HEY TAYLOR, IM SHANNON, I CANT WAIT TO SEE YOU 4 TIMES IN JUNE, I HOPE I CAN GIVE YOU A BIG CUDDLE
I need so much help. My cars engine is blown. Still owe on it, needs a new engine but I can’t afford that. I have kids who depend on me. #Swifties please pray for me!! I keep listening to #TaylorSwift music to get me through this time! Where’s Taylor when you need her? #PRAYPLZ
OK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MOMENT: 

I’m in my room sad after a bad day and all of a sudden I hear my sister go “ALEXA!!! PLAY DELICATE BY TAYLOR SWIFT!!!” to our amazon alexa because she wanted to make me feel better :’)) I LOVE HER AND YOU SO MUCH @taylorswift13 @taylornation13
The texts I get from my grandma honestly make me smile so big!!! She always drops off newspaper articles of Taylor at my house whenever she sees them :)) Look what you made her do!! @taylorswift13 We love you so much 
HEY GAL, IM SHANNON, I CANT WAIT TO SEE YOU 4 TIMES IN JUNE PRETTY GIRL

Dear T,
Thanks for making my friends dreams come true. I hope one day you can make mine come true. Britt @taylornation13 @TSOfficialMerch #DelicateMusicVideo
Some facts about the reputation era: I am making lots of new friends, we are getting life changing music videos, Taylor is hanging on Twitter, I have gotten noticed 5x by TN. What a beautiful time to be alive! @taylorswift13 @taylornation13 @TSOfficialMerch #TaylorSwiftDelicate
“I now believe that pain makes you stronger. And now I believe that walking (frolicking!!!) through a lot of rainstorms gets you clean.” #DelicateMusicVideo 
@taylornation13

@taylorswift13 I love the Delicate music video. It's so inspiring and it's so artistic. You are an inspiration to so many! We all love you. You honestly deserve all the happiness in the world. #DelicateMusicVideo
E pro brasil linda vem quando
Esse assunto é delicado more
lately my anxiety and ptsd have been at an all time high & recently i got told i should change everything about myself, but once again @taylorswift13 came through with such a happy, be yourself, be carefree, inspiring music video  love you, T #DelicateMusicVideo
I've battled ptsd and depression for ages now and i am so happy to read this. Never change anything about yourself unless you want to. Delicate is a great song & video.
Okay @elvinmensah @AlexWoodland23  @Callum_Skeff I'm 100% into this. Yes. Yes. Yes.
I do love it, I think it's nice to see a bit of old Taylor like she's not a different person she just has a different style music. The only thing is I don't think it fits the song perfectly
Roger is throwing you and Emma under the bus girl, he just confirmed you're both gonna be high profile witnesses and are saavy to NWO. He's got a bit of verbal diarrhea and loves to chat. Just giving you a heads up Tay. The avocados got your back though 
Hi Taylor. I’m a young 12-year-old girl and a fan of yours. I’ve never seen one of your concerts probably because I’m french. I’ve been trying for the past 3 month to see if you were coming in Paris but sadly, you aren’t. I really hope that you can see this. Thanks, Mathilde.
Please RT so Taylor can see !
Please reply to me I love you so much

I'm so proud of you!! I love you and miss you so much!! #DelicateMusicVideo
love the faces you was making
Love the concept. #DelicateMusicVideo @taylorswift13
I love Taylor in LWYMMD,  but this Taylor owns my heart. 
Only she can do both.  #DelicateMusicVideo #Delicate
I am just so thankful for things you have done for other fans including me and thank you so much for the delicate music video because isn’t isn’t isn’t amazing? Yes! @taylorswift13 @taylorswift13 ILY GUYS SO MUCH
@taylorswift13 I am so tired Im gonna go to bed, but just know you're my best friend and I love you so much. I hope you take the time to look at my tweets  Goodnight. Thank you for an amazing video. #DelicateMusicVideo
Tbt 2016 when i showed up to my half doc party with this dress and i couldnt care less bout people's opinion cause if you dont like me for who i am then watch me bein myself even more right? Thank you for always bein there for me #DelicateMusicVideo
This is the best thing. The difference between the grown up videos of LWYMMD, RFI and EG makes me sooo happy. This shows that Taylor hasn't changed a bit in the things we love. Just grown up and found the confidence to do this.
me and jessica went from crying sad tears to happy tears so fast. we love you & everything you do endlessly  #DelicateMusicVideo
I love the fact you are so unusual. If you're happy I'm happy  #DelicateMusicVideo
my first time listening to delicate with you & all of my friends vs watching the delicate music video with my best  friend  i love you & this song & the messages the video sends. thank you for everything you do for us #DelicateMusicVideo
The #DelicateMusicVideo is beautiful. I freaking love it. And @taylorswift13 & @taylornation13 hanging out with us tonight. What an amazing day. I am soooo happy. I love being in this Swiftie family so much.
Thank you for this video. Thank you for the beautiful message. Thank you for writing music. Thank you for always staying so true to yourself. Thank you for being such an amazing role model. & thank you for blessing me with such amazing friends!! I love you! #DelicateMusicVideo
thank you @taylorswift13 for everything you’ve done! my life would be so different without you and your music, ever since i was a lil itty bitty child! i love you so much and i can not wait to see you perform in los angeles and nashville. see you soon! 
“Hang on. 
You’re loved, even when you feel alone. 
It gets easier. Then it gets okay. Then it feels like freedom.” 
I feel like this quote is the embodiment of the #DelicateMusicVideo and I am a puddle of emotion. I needed this so bad. Thank you, T.  @taylorswift13
The song is even more emotional now I've seen the video.. I LOVE IT #DelicateMusicVideo
you make me so so so happy. i love the video. thank u for sending such a powerful message #DelicateMusicVideo
this is how happy YOU and the #DelicateMusicVideo make me and @Jessica_here7 we love you so much, thank you for being you everyday 
I JUST REALIZED THAT THE DELICATE VIDEO IS SIMILAR TO THE SHAKE IT OFF VIDEO EXCEPT THIS TIME SHE ENDS UP WITH THE FELLA OVER THERE WITH THE HELLA GOOD HAIR #DelicateMusicVideo @taylornation13 @taylorswift13
YOU ARE SO FEARLESS
#DelicateMusicVideo
Hey @taylorswift13 my brother swears that you’re saying “Is it cool that I said ‘Hola’.” Can you clarify this for me? He claims you even waved in the music video for that line. #Hola  Or #AllThat  #LoveYouEitherWay 
#DelicateMusicVideo 
I know this video just came out but it already means a lot to me. It’s really inspiring to me. It makes me want to go out and dance like no one is watching. It makes me want to be myself and not care what anyone thinks. Thank you for everything!  #DelicateMusicVideo
I'm so emotional to see that in the beginning the only moment that you didnt fake a smile was when you were with the fans
I hope you know that for us you never been invisible we always saw(and will always see) this taylor: happy free and being herself 

thanks for this lesson
Taylor, thank you so much. Each time I watch, I uncover things I had missed before. Blown away with how you took a song we all thought was about falling in love with someone else & created a story about falling in love with yourself & embracing the fact you don't fit in. 
The #DelicateMusicvideo really hit close to home and I am so lucky to have Taylor as a best friend.
I know this video just came out but it already means a lot to me. It’s really inspiring to me. It makes me want to go out and dance like no one is watching. It makes me want to be myself and not care what anyone thinks. Thank you for everything! #DelicateMusicVideo
@peacepistol_ sis this is pretty cute!!!
It is :) not what I was expecting but I dig it
Saaaame I had to double check I was watching the right thing lmao
New goal for 2018: live like nobody is watching. Thank you, @taylorswift13  @taylornation13 #DelicateMusicVideo
this will be us this August.
An understatement. Heavy on the awkwardness.
@VannyLK  @everydaysawi Oh. My. Gosh!
Awwww!!! Your expressions when you are sitting in front of the mirror trying to be happy just melted my heart. I love you Taylor and always will. The music video is freakinnggg amazing! 
Lots of love from India
