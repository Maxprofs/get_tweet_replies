fuck me up
@_christina_eck you

The "old Taylor" has been resurrected. She's alive & well. This inside look into your creative process is so organic & immensely inspiring. I had to get that all off my chest. I hate seeing the hellish underworld of Tinsel Town subject such raw talent to petty politics. Awesome.
By the by, if you've never seen David Lynch's 'Mulholland Dr.', I can't recommend it enough. Not only does it feature astounding visuals & performances, but its overarching theme is exploitation & the myriad forms in which it can manifest & creep on you w/out you even noticing.

my fav song on your album
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me...
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink...
Dive bar on the east side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Love you Taylor
incredible! love this song!

thank you for sharing your video
her discipline is keeping her to look that way.that is my oppinion,maybe you had different Teylor in mind.
I think you have really good perspective,when comes to alter ego Teylor.She is very disciplined,but in that side of the glass
do and the wait for it...
