The old taylor didn't entirely die if shes still ripping those cords.
I think Taylor Swift would make a great collaboration with Avril Lavigne if she were to try out for rock still love her country music though

@taylorswift13 you who are so near by your fans. Could you do me the biggest favour and record a quick happy birthday  video for my dearest friend Ace who's the biggest biggest fan of you that I know. He got all your albums and songbooks and learns all your songs in his guitar.

Why can't we go back to a time when people just did their job and did not "kill" and "slay"? We are overfocused on performance and exceptionalism.

She don’t everything good. Every performance is amazing.
Nice ... see 2 seconds of her performance
Who says?
i couldn't care less about some pop star ...she can rotten , her soul is gone... waste of energy
Hello Taylor, I am Ana and I really a big fan of yours and i love that you were in the movie the lorax.
