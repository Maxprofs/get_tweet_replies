I think Taylor would make a great personification of the goddess Venus for a movie script I'm working on "Venus: Suck Your Mother". It occurred to me in a dream last night.

This is just perfection. There's strength in numbers, folks. It's up to US to dismantle false idols & Swizzler is good enough to give y'll a head start on that front. That makes our LEGITIMATELY difficult lives just a touch easier.

I found all 25 of those Men's Health magazines for $5.00 at a thrift store

I found that set of cd's at Salvation Army for $1.99

It's really nice to be in constant communication with Jesus Christ all day and night

"...At First Sight"
3 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:

4 That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. Matthew 6:1-4 KJV
2 Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
6 Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.
I always give away everything secretly and I'm always taken care of
Job lost everything and he got back sevenfold
Its sort of about non-attachment to material possessions
I'm not sure how you get into that lifestyle but you end up giving everything you have away material possessions and then you buy more stuff or people give you things
I regularly give away everything I have
Instead of saying I gave away $1,000,000 and got back a few million but you aren't specific about where you got the $1,000,000 from to really prove your point
If you gave $1,000,000 then you might get $1,000,000 back from 4 different sources and you could even write down literally where the $1,000,000 came from each time to make it more real
The revelation he got from God about the scriptures on giving
Its like Bill Gates meditated on the Bible scripture give and it shall be given unto you and then got a revelation from God about that scripture and based his entire company Microsoft on the revelation he got from that scripture
Bill Gates has given so much that its almost like he based his entire Microsoft company on the Bible scriptures about giving
Bill Gates has given more than the rest of us
We have to go back to the root of the word forgive for-give pay up!
Bill Gates is richer than all of us honestly because he has given more
Can I preach?
The same measure that you give it will be given unto you
If you don't believe God will give back to you what you gave in multiples then give away $10 or tithe $10 to the Church CH and see if you don't get back $40 from one source or various sources
And God says in the Bible that you can test Him on that
The same amount that you give comes back to you in multiples of what you originally gave
If you were to give $1,000 to the Church then you'll get back $1,000 4 or more times so you would get $4,000 back because you gave $1,000
If you give $100 to the church then you will get back $100 from 4 to 6 different sources
Like if you give $20 to the church or food bank then you will get back $20 4-6 times
When you give something away you get back the same thing in the same proportion that you gave it in multiples
Since you gave this homeless fan a house and some money you should expect to be getting back what you gave in multiples
I'm still trying to get to my point you just gave a homeless girl a house
Do you want me to see if I can find the FUBU coat that I gave to the homeless guy in Florida?
This was a $350 FUBU coat that was waterproof and windproof and I gave that to a homeless guy because we were the n Florida and I figured he needed it more than I did if he was sleeping outside
The same way Joseph's brother's were jealous of him for having the technicolor coat
I guess he was talking too much crap but either way I'm sure some of the other homeless people were really jealous of him for having that coat
I gave one homeless guy my nicest coat it was a $350 FUBU coat lol and two days later someone told me that he was beat up and got that coat stolen from him because he couldn't keep his mouth shut
38 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again. Luke 6:38 KJV
7 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. Galatians 6:7 KJV
And I gave him a coat
That's a long story but either way there was a homeless guy that I met out there
Here's my point that was 6 coats and one time when I sort of ran away from home and hopped on the Greyhound bus to Kissimmee, Florida which is one city away from Orlando, Florida to stay with my aunt
I try not to wear that coat because its so nice and I don't want to look like I'm showing off
I know vegans aren't too happy to hear about that but its not like I buy those kind of coats all the time
The last coat is like a thick winter leather coat its a leather coat with padding and it has that fur on the hood and that fur is real fox hair and I bought it for $10
Those last three coats even the one with fur on it were all leather the last one us a Wilson's leather coat that is probably about $350 retail and I found it at a thrift store for $10







i love you so much，i will go to your concert.i will
All I gotta say is can I talk to you for a minute? and that's pretty much the same as saying let me holla at you
Let me speak to you for a min. I'm trying to figure out the cool way to say it if you were a cool person and you wanted to preach would you say let me holla at you for a min.?

They should have after Christmas sales today
You don't necessarily have to return stuff the next day they usually give you 2 weeks to return stuff depending on the company but who knows? And I was gonna research to see what kind of after Christmas deals that they had from today until New Years Eve
Everyone's probably doing all of their returns and playing with their new Christmas gifts today
That's 3 potential sources of income right there
So far I have 
-Part-time or full time job
-Online art business
-Selling prints of artwork
at the Flea Market
I don't have the money to even make monthly payments on any debt that's why I'm thinking about all the possible sources of income that I could possibly have and its really cool
Well I know people probably spent a lot on credit cards recently and I'm not saying anything about that its just where I'm at personally in my life
I know they have good debt but I'm not talking about that either I'd rather not get anymore debt at all in any form lol
Like part-time or full-time job that's one source of income. Then I also have Online Art Business as another source of income etc. and not credit cards and or loans I'm talking about sources where you make money without any debt
Glory to God for all these awesome ideas
Its an idea about I'm writing down possible sources of income then I remembered that book "Multiple Streams Of Income"
You probably already know about it
I just had got? had or got this awesome idea
Either way your product would have to be at the gas station for them to be able to buy it
Maybe some people buy a phone case from the gas station as a last minute thing because they do like the artwork on it
Then what about the people who don't want a phone case with art on it? and where do they go typically to buy phone cases? Where did you buy your phone case? All those kinds of questions
That's how I realized this morning how important it is to know who your customers are
You know what might be a good seller? Maybe iPhone or phone cases but then why would someone buy my phone case when maybe they don't want a phone case with a certain piece of art because maybe they like the style but they don't like the subject of the art
Almost everyone likes my style of art
And think about what does everybody like? And try to think of the whole world of people all at once and their wants and needs and then give them that and that's what I did with my style of art everyone in the world loves my art
And one thing that helps me when I think of my fans and customers I try to kind of visualize a part of the globe of the earth and or maybe get a vague mental picture of a region like America or try to fathom every country and as many people as possible
That's what I've sort of been thinking about this morning and one of the ideas was about who is my customer?
Right now with the things that I tweet not everybody wants to favorite because in their mind why would they favorite my tweets or retweet me?
I'm not even going to try to get my Twitter account authorized because I'm probably gonna close this account and start a completely different one for business with a completely different image and start making nice tweets that people are going to want to favorite
Should I try to get one of those blue check marks next to my name?

I read the news about you filming "End Game" I can't wait to see the new music video!
What are you doing today Taylor?
They can pretty much do everything and I was about to close my account because I wasn't selling anything
I'm at page 43 and they can so much stuff on that website that I didn't even know about
Wow this is a 238 page Microsoft Word document that I copy and pasted stuff from different websites!
I thought there wasn't very much on that website but it turns out they can do way more stuff than I originally thought
This morning I opened up one of my 1,000's of random Microsoft Word documents and pdf's on my USB that I gathered from online about how to sell prints online and this one is about http://FineArtAmerica.com  and I've been scanning through it and actually reading it
I've had my art on http://FineArtAmerica.com  for over a year now and I don't think it's selling because I might have to upload it differently it's a print-on-demand type of website
Sorry to bother you again this is the last thing I'll say for today
Merry Christmas!

I just found out a bunch of good information
I was researching luggage on that website and the suitcases with 4-8 wheels are called spinner luggage
http://www.luggageontour.com 
They have that same Samsonite folding cart at Walmart online for $25
Folding Cart
That's the wheel cart thing that you can connect to the bag lol
Did you like those Brightline bags at all?  They seem alright I like the regular luggage that has the four wheels so you can push the bag in any direction those are cool
Wonderful.
Some of those Brightline bags do have locking zippers

Mark 11:24-25 KJV
24 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.

25 And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.
