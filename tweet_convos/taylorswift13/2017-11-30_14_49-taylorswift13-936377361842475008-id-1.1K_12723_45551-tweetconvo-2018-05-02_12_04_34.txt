Reputation .You teach me to refuse what I hate and treasure what I like. I get stronger after hearing your songs
So umm #ReputationStreamingParty anyone?? 

@ArielNicole325 do you like this one? I think it’s good.
YES. It's one of my favorite songs on the album. I love the "big reputation" part the most.

Very unhappy about the ticket system. My son worked hard for months and is one of the top to get tickets early and the selection is horrible.  @taylorswift13 @taylornation13 .  We are stuck buying tickets that are not great seats and he is unhappy which means I am an unhappy mom!

Ahhhh this is awesome!!
