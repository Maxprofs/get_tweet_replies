Awesome! This is a good song!

@RossWalkerSmith our reactions 
It'll probs grow on us. Let's be real.
Really digging the new song. Love that u always do something different & continue to show incredible range.

I've listened to it 5 times! 
I can't stop listening to your new song. 

It's awesome. 

Is the beginning an homage to Juice Newton's "Angel of the Morning"?!? #Deadpool
PLEASE DO ARENAS TOO AND ADD A GA FLOOR OR A CHEAP GA PIT AT STADIUMS DMDKMDKD :) we poor out here @taylornation13
I second this
I'm not tryna pay for a VIP package 
ready to see you finally dethrone Despacito. Welcome back Queen. Excited to hear the new work
Don't think that's happening.
Trust me, it’s gonna happen
No. Not with this song at least. This is too different from what usually tops the charts.
Well she’s already at number one
Taylor, this is not you. I am heartbroken by how not good and not you this is. Really really bad and I've been your diehard fan 15 years 
So I may not love the new song (it's grown on me), but OMG THE VIDEO MAY BE THE BEST OF ALL TIME. Now THAT'S the genius I love. #LWYMMD #TS6
Me too.
Spend it on Powerball. #LookWhatYouMadeMeDo
I want to buy a taco.
Do that.
Ok.
YOU DID THAT.
SHE DID THAT.
wish I have that..

听着首单加上这个视频怎么感觉我霉腹黑了呢
！！！！！！！！！she's dead
Luv ya
"the old Taylor cant to the phone right now. why? cause she is dead"look what they do to Taylor. fuck the haters! we always love you Taylor
Ama licj  you some
Meh
New song was amazing, it had a really dark 80s electronic vibe to it. Best part is when you said the old Taylor was dead. Good stuff.
I stan a legend
FANS TRUST YOU TRUELY, MADLY AND DEEPLY.
: "New single #LookWhatYouMadeMeDo out now. Pre-order #reputation:…" #1 in United Kingdom
i actually broke the replay button 
Taylor swift.  If I say something she will make a song out of it or take. Me to court .
ALISON TIENES QUE VENIR A MÉXICO SI HACES TOUR POR FAVOR

Some pretty don't like good person so she right!!! 
Estupendo

Me rn :

it sucks.
Bring that shade girl! You've earned it. You're an Arya Swift with all the names on her list. Keep turning those emotions into hit songs 
Good for you TayTay!! Way to shut them up in a professional musical style! I love it!!
LEGEND

Shook

"Look what you made me do" is exactly what our abusers tell us when they hurt us.  Very poor choice of words.
Why is YouTube views stuck at 470305?? 
Something's not right with YouTube 
Love you and always support you!!!!!!!

The old Taylor...so cliche. :( Taylor don't go into the light. All of us Taylor fans miss you. #pleasecomeback #betterthanthis
IT'S AMAZING WE LOVE YOU
Tried to say I expected better. I hope this isn't a preview of what the whole album will be like. Damn. Waited a long time for... mediocre.

MUM
The lyrics are just so guuud
you woke me up very early
was feeling...you writing
This is horrid.
I've listened to this masterpiece nonstop all morning, and I'm not ashamed of doing so.

Way to rip off fans and exclude independent record shops.
Taylor your new single isn't bad but it's disappointing... please don't do that sing talk thing ever again

I FREAKING LOVE IT!
Posso sentire Michele sclerare per questo @michele_bravi
I love it, it's perfect 
I love it
love you
Worst day to post it so much more music come out than this lol
thanks Taylor lots of love.
it's on repeat currently .... LOVE it!!!!!!!!!!
I should say this to YOU Taylor }-] #BedroomFloor #Gorgeous
Guess nothing can match Blank Space and Wildest Dreams. Course, if u were to do more romantic videos with @ScottEastwood I would LOVE that.
Come to Quebec City!!!! 
my 8 year old self is so disappointed with this song lol
Best song ever
I loved it! It showed the angry side finally reacting. Idc what everyone else is crying about. Sing it louder!
Oh my god!! I'm freaking out...!!!!!!!!!! I love you so much tay.... You're the best.!
QUEEN
Love u.
https://youtu.be/iJPRNLQrFFY  check it out 
Oh my God'' Some body say crazy and dig it so hard, But I'm not think so about her, Yeah I like this song, You just gonna be revolution 
I'm not sure what I'm feeling even though I love you

This is one awesome video!
You really did change in a positive way. I love you Tay. You're really amazing! You'll always be my number one
Amazing artist :)
No thx
It lit I like listen to a million times great song
I really love you .
You are nothing but a Illuminati princess who has sold her soul!
After listening to this, the fair judgement is....You're not calling it a truce with Katy, are you?
this is more to do with with Kim Kartrashian and Kenya west beef after which people called her a snake and #riptaylorswift was trending
We Love You 
PTDR T KI ?

I AM DYING!!!!!!!! IM SO EXCITED I CANT TAKE IT! I've been playing it on repeat the whole day! Love you so so much!
This song is terrible. Your not even singing through most of it, it's like monotone talking? Yeah no.
Look what you made me do TS 
I miss the 2010 Taylor. I jammed to the whole fearless album 
Taylor: Anti-fans? Who fuking cares？I SLAY！
