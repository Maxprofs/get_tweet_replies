.@SenJoniErnst You could learn so much from @HawkeyeFootball. First: If they bungle a play, they don't throw the team under the bus.
@SenJoniErnst still waiting for apology on that ridiculous vote to defund AHCA (again) and Planned Parenthood
@bclorio @SenJoniErnst you do know that planned parenthood is the creation of racist Margret Sanger to control black populations?
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball don't worry we all know you hate iowa
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball blaming the staff huh?
@oregon_girl3 @SenJoniErnst Politicians never admit making a mistake or take responsibility
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball Those responsible for the sacking have been sacked. A moose once bit my sister.
.@SenJoniErnst @KWWL @HawkeyeFootball that's code for "unpaid student who is no longer employed at this office for making me look bad"
@SenJoniErnst Staff when its an error. So you dont have control over your staff? Your staff is disconnected from football in IOWA?
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball Blaming your "staff" shows your utter incompetence as a tweeter and as a Senator.
@SenJoniErnst @KWWL @HawkeyeFootball Sure blame it on the staff! Haha
@SenJoniErnst @OliviaKWWL It's your staff, Senator. Show some leadership and take responsibility. It's part of the job.
Nothing that you say or do is truthful. Please stop representing me. Can not wait to vote you out. @SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball
@lowercasetres what happened?
@nickseguin she tweeted that Iowa won the championship against Michigan state last night when they actually lost.
@lowercasetres sheesh
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball I'm sure your "staff" appreciates the bus that just ran them over. Personal responsibility need not apply
@SenJoniErnst @KWWL @HawkeyeFootball just like @realDonaldTrump throwing your staff under the bus.
@SenJoniErnst @OliviaKWWL @HawkeyeFootball Blaming the staff! Haha classy
@SenJoniErnst Makes it even worse that you didn’t consider tweeting that yourself. Sure, blame your staff.
@SenJoniErnst I don't know what's more embarrassing, your mistake on Iowa winning last night, or the fact we elected you.
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball There season isn't over yet. Rose Bowl is NOT a consolation prize. It is still a MAJOR bowl. #GoHawks
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball  and people are counting on you to make great decisions in the senate!?
@SenJoniErnst very nice of you to apologize but why blame your staff? Do you blame the staff when you have a success?
.@SenJoniErnst When in doubt, blame staff!
@SenJoniErnst By the way, is it true you received $3MM from the NRA? Is that why you voted against the latest gun control bills?
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball So your staff also sent the apology? Awesome staff!
@SenJoniErnst No, I'm sorry that you're my senator.
“@SenJoniErnst: Sorry for staff error. @hawkeyefootball had a great season. Extraordinary effort tonight.” No congratulatory #GoGreen ?
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball ...and you want to cut spending on education in IA? Do you ever monitor your staffs quoting you? #Boneheaded
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball still one game left... #getaclue
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball why dont you just do your own tweets? #noob
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball staff error my ass. #whydidanyonevoteforyou #showsyourincompetence
@SenJoniErnst you should double down on your mistake like most GOP'ers do and tweet that yes, Iowa did win.
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball Wow! Look at all the haters out there! Not surprised. It's amusing.
@SenJoniErnst you can delete but the internet still knows! Maybe try watching the game next time :/
@SenJoniErnst  Nice, the bus you are driving just ran over a staffer..ouch.
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball delete your account and step down
@tikkikki @SenJoniErnst willing to bet that intern got fired this morning.
@packer_hawk @SenJoniErnst of course they did. Spineless.
@SenJoniErnst Thanks for blaming other people for your mistake.  #ownit
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball there went your re election
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball wow throw your staff under the bus much?! Personal accountability!!! Get some'
@SenJoniErnst at least take the blame "staff error" #idiot
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball  Typical to blame it on the "staff".  Don't expect much from a #teabagger though.  #idiot
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball Though the tweet was in error, many of us wish the outcome was for real.
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball typical Pub politician, make mistake, throw staff under bus
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball Idiot.
Appears @SenJoniErnst has a staff just about as dumb as she is..
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball
@SenJoniErnst Was it also your staff that took hundreds of thousands of blood money from the NRA?
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball little past bedtime huh? Delete the tweet - screenshots live forever. 
#GoGreen
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball deactivate
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball why did you delete your tweet? Drunk tweeting i see. Just like your football team both of y'all are losers.
@SenJoniErnst wow run your staff under the bus. Mistake corrected with a mistake
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball Joni loves Chachi
@SenJoniErnst You are the worst.
@SenJoniErnst  bought and paid for by the NRA. Let's terrorists on the no fly list buy machine guns.
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball I'm glad you'll only be in office for one term.
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball and BTW the season isn't over.. Go Hawks! #Bowlbound.
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball Congratulations, Iowa for being so stupid in electing someone just as clueless. Guess BIG10 wasn't priority!
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball "Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her." #Hypocrites
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball Blaming your staff? Take responsibility for your tweets.
@SenJoniErnst @SirDrakeWilson @HawkeyeFootball Just own it.
https://twitter.com/HayesBrown/status/673393073204793344 … Don’t delete your tweets and then blame them on your “staff” @SenJoniErnst.
Sorry for staff error. @hawkeyefootball had a great season. Extraordinary effort tonight.
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball
.@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball So your "staff" is making you have to squeal like a pig?
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball oh so it's cool to put your name on the twitter profile but blame staff when mistake made?  #Leadership
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball Blame your gaffe on staff....Nice. Come on Iowa, you can do better than this for a US Senator.
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball way to throw your staff under the bus. Real class from an Iowa politician 
@SenJoniErnst @JenniferJJacobs @HawkeyeFootball Not my fault - the staff did it. There's some real leadership.
@SenJoniErnst this crap isn’t about @HawkeyeFootball it’s about political credibility. Own your @twitter #tweets. No staffer bs.
@SenJoniErnst who's in charge of that staff!?
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball
@SenJoniErnst @JenniferJJacobs @HawkeyeFootball Don't blame the staff Senator, own it! Great Season Hawkeyes!
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball Have you been impeached yet by the fine people of Iowa?
@SenJoniErnst Damn,weren't watching? You took proud @HawkeyeFootball moment making it about you.What happened to buck stops here?Except #GOP
@SenJoniErnst Maybe you should try running your own Twitter account.
@SenJoniErnst stick to castrating hogs and leave football to the football experts.
@SenJoniErnst so the same amount attention is paid to college football as is to your job. Got it. We're good.
@SenJoniErnst Take responsibility, or actually watch the game and send your own tweets instead of trying to get cheap pops from constituents
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball It was your fault, not your staff. You big dummy.
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball I bet your staff tweeted this too.
@SenJoniErnst how would you know whether it was great or not?
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball Just like the Repulicans to declare victory before the war is over.
@SenJoniErnst no personal responsibility?  Horrible.
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball What a phony - pretending she watched the game!
@SenJoniErnst throwing the staff under the bus. Nice. Stick to voting the wrong side of history on gun control. As if you were watching game
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball It's ok. We're used to you not researching the facts before you speak.
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball @jimrome @kylebrandt #DeweyDefeatsTruman #Doh
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball throwing your staff under the bus, senator? So GOP
@MFIMiami @KevinFarris @SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball Joni Ernst is a clump of Iowa turf?
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball.... Just not a win #deweydefeatstruman
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball Even Iowa State fans were watching. #breadbags
@SenJoniErnst @hawkeyefootball @Jeremy_J_KCSR Iowa = FAIL
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball hahahahahah
.@SenJoniErnst @scj @HawkeyeFootball Type your own damn tweets.  No reason for some lowly intern to do it for you.
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball hilarious! Watch the game next time before commenting.  They still haven't beaten a single good team
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball staff error?
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball congrats to hawks for winning the nba stanley cup open regatta!
@SenJoniErnst @HawkeyeFootball Way to throw your staffer under the bus, genius #JoniErnst. Still made you look bad.
