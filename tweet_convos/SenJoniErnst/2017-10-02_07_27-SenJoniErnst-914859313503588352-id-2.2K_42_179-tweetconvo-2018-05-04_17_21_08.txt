Will you be returning the  you received from the NRA & vote 4 stricter laws? Or will they continue to own you? $3,124,273 from the NRA
@SenJoniErnst you took $3,124,273 from @NRA to pray about gun violence but do nothing about it. 

#SendBackTheBloodMoney NOW!
Why don't you send them the 3 million dollars you have taken from the NRA? Prayers mean nothing without action.
Lying craven coward. Claiming unaware of bump stocks. Lying craven red state KKK NRA MILITIA pro civil war sack of shit. Full auto common
Modification at gun shows and you KNOW IT YOu lying ‘Evangelical Christian’. NRA MILITIA SELL THESE BUMP STOCKS AT EVERY GUN SHOW WITH PLANS
NRA MILITIA SELL THIS MODIFICATION TO MAKE THEM MORE LETHAL IN PREP FOR THE CIVIL WAR YOU SUPPORT
Please do something about guns in America! Start by getting your colleagues to vote no on the Share Act, which would deregulate silencers.
50+ dead Americans vs the $3+ million in NRA money. Guess which way the @SenJoniErnst is going to vote? #Greed #Corruption
As a senator that makes money to not change gun laws, your prayers are hypocrisy at its finest.  You should take a lesson from Rep. Murphy.
How about you do more than pray? How about you stop enabling mass killings by being a shill for the NRA? Hell is waiting for you.
As you cash $3,124,273 in checks from the N.R.A.
Then quit taking money from the #NRA and work to stop the #AmericanGunEpidemic. Get on the right side of history.
How much money have you taken from the NRA, Senator? There is blood on your hands.
How are the 60 milllion KKK going to support themselves when the 255 million USA Citizens kick their asses out for good this time THE NRA?
Prayers are what got us to this point.
What are you going to do besides pray?
take another $3 million from the gun lobby and then pray again
NRA blood money affecting your party's policy. This is the deadly environment we live in now BECAUSE OF YOU.
What good are your prayers? Didn’t stop you from taking blood money from the NRA did it? I can’t believe you’re supposed to represent me.
This senseless act of #gunviolence could have been prevented by valuing human life more than #NRApayouts. It's time for #GunControlNow.
You took $3,124,273 from the @NRA to ensure that such senseless violence could continue.
Prayers don't do shit. Never stopped a shooting or prevented another one. But you know that don't you. All about the money from NRA for you
What is senseless is the right to bear high powered weaponry. No mass shootings in Australia since 1996 gun control
My prayers are with all of the victims in #LasVegas and their loved ones affected by this senseless act of violence.
You are #Complicit

Find your humanity, stop taking millions from the #NRA, and be a Christian instead of playing one on tv and in church. #LasVegas #NRALogic
You should post all the money you receive from the NRA before every tweet regarding “thoughts and prayers” on gun violence.  #openandhonest.
Enjoy your blood money you soulless death merchant
Its nor good but u know i love ya buddy
Iowa the heartland of EVANGELICAL-BIGOTRY, hatred, Christian sharia law, UNAMERICAN UNCHRISTIAN VALUES OF REPUBLICANS OF THE KKK
C'mon. You don't give a shit about LV. Shootings just a normal outcome of a gun culture that you enable. Congratulations, it's working.
Send Back the blood money, you vampire!
Prayers are useless.
My prayers are for your soul for not standing up to the NRA.
How does it feel to be responsible for the deaths of those people by taking 3 million $ from the nra and fighting Gun control legislation
It's way too soon to religionize this tragedy.
#BloodMoney
How much $$ have you taken from the @NRA?
3.1 million. That's a whole lot of blood on her hands.
I got a letter from you 10/12 explains all Iowa is doing to help Puerto Rico. Why aren't you announcing publicly and consistently, why?
24 iowa men and women sent to help Military police in Puerto Rico. Can you update us on their progress for 3. 9 million Americans in PR?
this blood is on you and the other members of our government that took money from the NRA
Where is your money?
Americans need more than prayers. Your failure to legislate sensible gun control makes your prayers meaningless. Is God even listening?
#sendbackthebloodmoney
#GunControlNow
Do your job senator, get rid of these guns on our streets.
Less prayer, more action. Prayers won't save wounded, or prevent this from happening again. Put your blood money where your mouth is.
And anything else?
Forget prayers, hypocrite #SendBackTheBloodMoney and pass strong gun control legislation NOW. You have blood on your hands
Thanks for being the cause of this violence by taking over 3million dollars form the NRA. Your prayers don't work. Your hands are bloody
The NRA owns you.
Prayers?  You've been bought by the NRA. #SendBackTheBloodMoney, or do you get paid by the #BodyCount?
The nra is an 2nd amendment advocate, and the biggest gun safety promoter in America, you need to watch less media and do fact research.
It's all about the cash for you. Shame
Joni won't stop supporting the National Rifle Assoc. they gave her $3,124,273. she'd do it for less.
#guncontrolnow
Keep praying. U want a ban-wrong ban. Put a lid on guns and don't need to go thru this. We r the terrorists not Muslims. Get it right.
$3+ Million over saving lives. Wow.
You can keep your canned response of "thoughts and prayers." Taking three million $ from NRA is disgusting and immoral
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Send back the monies the NRA gave you. Actions speak louder than words.
Hope the $3mil from the NRA helped s you sleep at night. Because it scares the crap out of me.
What is WRONG with you??? You accepted $3,124,274 from the @NRA but your PRAYERS are with the victims? #LasVegasMassacre #BloodMoney
...committed with a legal automatic weapon, capable of killing people 3 football fields away, a gun every hunter needs. Finished it for you.
Thanks - says it for me, too.
Go back to castrating hogs. Better pray for your own soul.
Don't pray, do your Fucking job
We don't need http://prayers.You  value automatic-like guns>than  your own families. You hope they won't come to your street. Need laws.
"Thoughts and Prayers" just means "Tough Shit" in GOP-speak.
"Faith without works is dead." —James 2:17
50 children were aborted in Las Vegas because you bow to the @NRA. #Gunwhore #YourLastTerm
Empty fucking words
The prayers didn't do shit. Look what happened in Texas today. Prepared to talk about gun legislation now or will the NRA not let you?
That’s not enough. You’re a senator. Do something.
So how much money were you given by the NRA there you Godly, Holy person?
over $3 million
How much did the NRA lobbyists pay you for thoughts and prayers?
Prayers or gun control? Your move...
Prayers? You are in the NRA’s pocket, and you have the nerve to say this?  Give me a break.
Their blood on your hands. Bankrolled by the pro-death machine lobby aka NRA.
@SenJoniErnst also signed a bill that made it easier for people with severe mental illness to buy guns legally. Why did you do this?  We need to make it harder for people to buy guns. #JimmyKimmel
My associates and I are trying to purchase cowardly politicians from low income states. You are good value. Please consider my offer.
I am your constituent. Please tell me how you will act to stop tragedies like this. Not just "prayers".
The Las Vegas shooting was tragic, I’m sure the shooter was a member of a well-regulated militia, so there was nothing we can do. Thanks NRA
Enough b.s. with your "thoughts and prayers". Put your mouth to good use and VOTE NO on the silencer bill. #GiveBackTheBloodMoney
Actions speak louder than your words. You took NRA blood money. You are complicit in these murders. What will you do now?
Please think about what makes sense!!
You bathed in their blood today.  Keep your prayers to yourself.
You took NRA money.  You're guilty.
"With all due respect your thoughts & prayers are insufficient."
#SendBackTheBloodMoney NOW! Your prayers just might not be enough.
You are so concerned that You are  going to pray weally, weaaalllly hard tonight that it won’t happen again! Right Joni?
You took $3,124,273 from @NRA 
Your prayers are false & hollow.
$3.1 million dollars from the gun lobby. What kind of mother are you????
we are way past thoughts & prayers. Those 50+ppl would like their life and pursuit of happiness back. Hope the $ is worth it!
Hypocrite
You took NRA blood money, traitor.
Prayers are with the victims.
Votes are with the @NRA
At last count, you were given $3,124,773 from the NRA. How much soap are you going to need to wash away that blood money?? So SAD & PATHETIC
Did you accept money from the NRA?  Then you might as well have provided the bullets. Hypocrisy. Deep hypocrisy on your part. Shame
Time to start laying the blood of our fellow Americans at the feet of our great, righteous Republican legislators........for doing nothing.
I’m praying for gun control
So you are praying for forgiveness because of all the $ you've taken from the NRA? Spare us your empty words and DO something
Send your blood soaked money back to the NRA or RESIGN NOW!
Could you not think of anything even a tiny bit more genuine sounding than that drivel?  Take your prayers, shove them, and do gun control
Prayer without action is worthless
And what sense are silencers?
Prayers wont save anyone from SENSELESS MURDERS! 
America does NOTHING to protect citizens—Govn loves MONEY more than PEOPLE! #GunControlNOW
Hollow words...
Give the NRA money back liar
$3 million from the @NRA salve your conscience?
Prayers aren.t good enough. Stop taking money from NRA and do something constructive
Does $3 million wash the blood off?
$3.5 mil NRA campaign contribution convinced u it was safe thing 4 Americans to vote NRA/GOP party line against assault weapon restrictions?
Over 3 million in bribes from the @NRA

Your words are worthless.

You're bought & paid for.
$3,124,000 from the NRA
What would you do if that was your kid, your partner, your friend? How can you accept this blood money? How do u sleep at night?
How's the view from inside the @NRA s pocket?  Is it a well of prayers & compassion there?
We don't need your prayers. We need you to take away these weapons of mass destruction
Evil wench. You took MILLIONS from the NRA!! Vegas victims’ blood is on your hands, you POS.

#SendBackTheBloodMoneyNow @SenJoniErnst took $3,124,273 from @NRA
Iowa deserves better
Prayers are cheap and so are your words.
Your prayers mean absolutely nothing. #GiveBacktheBloodMoney if you actually mean it!
Enough with the hocus pocus. Stop stuffing your pockets with NRA $$ and vote for gun control for humanity.
Just another day in GOP paradise!
Congress turn in your resignation now you have failed!
Praying does no damn good!  If it did, we should be done with killings & hurricanes by now.  Do something real - Sensible gun control!
Thoughts are with people of Las Vegas. Prayers that Congress takes ACTION.
#GunControlNow #ThoughtsAndPrayer #SendBackTheBloodMoney
God is a God of Justice; Joni Ernst permits injustice; Joni Ernst permits death by gun bybsiding with NRA
You need to reconsider your role in this. Feel free to pray, but you need to do so much more.
why don't you send back the NRA blood money NOW!? Oh yeah, you're a lying GOP politician. . .
Along with praying why don't you stop taking money from the NRA.
I approve silencers for #thoughtsandprayers hypocrites.
#GunControlNow 
#NRAKills 
The shooter was an American.
#AmericanAssassin
.#thoughtsandprayers r #EmptyJestures made by #EmptyJesters....
Phew! That'll take care of the problem. Gee, thanks, Senator!
Your words are hollow, ma'am. Can't ride both sides of the fence.
The only way to find sanity in America is to vote the NRA murderers out of congress. That means you, you’re a murderer,
@NRA paid u Over 3 million dollars. Don't u dare act horrified by this latest shooting. GFY republican POS.
I've been thinking about gun control and praying it happens soon.  Not working.  What do we do after thinking and praying?
Can we just say she's pro-murder and an accessory to this?
um...senseless? makes a lot of sense. a lot of people make a lot of $ from  guns. and the NRA stuffed 30mill down Trump's bra.
Send back your blood money to #NRA and stop praying
I might believe you if you hadn't taken more than $3M from the NRA.  You sell American lives for money.  You live with that.
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!!!!!!!!!
I bet you're praying harder that your NRA money doesn't dry up. What did you do with the 3 million you've been given so far?
You pray for NRA donations.
Legislation would be more effective.
You have blood on YOUR hands. We know how much $$$ you take from the NRA.
Where's your $3m the NRA paid you to say that and do nothing?
Your thoughts and prayers are tainted by @NRA blood money. #SendTheBloodMoneyBack
Your prayers aren't enough @SenJoniErnst, your pocket is full of $3,124,273 from the @NRA so we Iowans know we can't count on you.
Your prayers are useless to the victims. Our country needs gun control.
#sendthebloodmoneyback
Quit praying. Start solving this problem. God told me that’s what she wants.
$$$$$$$$$$$NRA$$$$$$$$$ it’s sad let’s talk about something else. NEXT.
Nope this won’t do. What common sense and majority of Americans beg for is gun control. Do Something!Help Protect Us #BanAssaultWeapons.
Our lawmakers are the lawbreakers
$3,123,273 from the NRA. You might as well have pulled the trigger.
.@SenJoniErnst took $3,124,273 from @NRA to pray about gun violence but do nothing about it.
Don’t make me tell you what you can do with your phony thought and prayers. The blood is on your hands.
Send back the money that @NRA has given you. It's blood money. I blame you. I blame them.
You’re awful.
"Tweets from Joni signed JKE." Really? Didn't even have the nuts to post this yourself? Maybe you do have some guilt. Maybe.
Your prayers aren't doing enough.
Your policy positions are with all of the industry executives and their lobbyists affected by your senseless act of pandering.
You owe your soul to NRA. What was the $3M for? We need #guncontrol now.
Prayers don't seem to be working!
Why don't you pray in one hand and s#!t in the other and see which one fills up faster?
Maybe you can take that $3M+ you received from the NRA & pay for the funerals of victims.
