.. 5-Vietnam war deferments for foot 'ouch-ie' makes #maga @realDonaldTrump a "war hero?" or a draft-dodging "dictator?"
Amen!!!
2/3 of Iowa wants to keep ACA.  You are representing the GOP and the Koch bros, not the people.  #DoYourJob  NO on G-C!
WE ARE BEGGING YOU PLEASE #RegularOrder #GrahamCassidyBill WOULD DEVASTATE OUR FAMILY & MANY~PRE-EXISTING & LOW INCOME WOULD DEVASTATE 
Republicans do not care about anything except the agenda we need to vote every single one of them out @ChuckGrassley
Imposes lifetime or yearly caps, no protections for chronically ill, a bad cancer diagnosis could cost you everything if enacted.
Protect mandatory health benefits then. If you won't,we know how much you care a out our veterans. 
So you are voting no on #GrahamCassidy? A yes vote is reprehensible, irresponsible, & inhumane. #wewillrememberin2020, #showusthekochmoney

Us veterans did fight tirelessly, while your POTUS applied for & was granted 5 deferments for fu_ken bone spurs. Vote against ACA repeal
The Graham-Cassidy bill would break with decades of progress toward improving human health, @jameshamblin writes

No plan for normalizing risk pool, so premiums will be like 10 years ago: unaffordable.
My uncle is a Vet depending on Medicaid you threaten. #VoteNOGrahamCassidy and support Vets
#GrahamCassidy hurts veteran families. We don't even know how deeply, because no CBO. Plz remember yr bothers & sisters in service. Vote NO!
Stand up for veterans by not taking their health care away by gutting Medicare. VOTE NO! #NoGrahamCassidy
So you are voting NO on #GrahamCassidy then!
So you get different health insurance because you're a people's representative but it's ok to give the people crap? These are not IA values!
If you actually give a shit about vets or what they stand for, vote no on G-C, which will literally kill Americans. Be an American. Vote no.


#HealthcareIsAHumanRight

So you think given the opportunity to cut health care from employees and no unions left to protect workers. They won't? Real fantasy
I think shes in line for some of 400 million from the Koch brothers.
Yet you're going to strip health care insurance from them and their families.  Yeah, you put the "care" back in "couldn't care less."
Block grants can be abused. Depends who is governor. Would hate to be in a state with very poor governor making these decisions.
To be clear: money goes to states that didn't expand Medicaid, at expense of those who did.
Senator, is still not clear to me why you support Graham Cassidy. You have said you're skeptical, but does that really mean anything?
Then why won't you protect them and vote no on #GrahamCassidy ? How Repealing Obamacare Would Hurt Veterans
I want to thank you from my heart. Your efforts addressing former President's pay puts the angels on your side. This practice must stop



#realnews #GrahamCassidySucks

So you got tired of killing others you now want to kill Iowans with health bill. Killer of the disabled Joni Ernst.
KILL THE BILL KILL THE BILL KILL THE BILL. THEN KILL TRUMPSTER AND HIS CRONIES.
Now U fight tirelessly for our Healthcare and work together to fix/fund the ACA like Majority of US want! #GrahamCassidy Hasty & Bad for 
Americans need & deserve regular order and bipartisanship esp in such huge legislation.  It's immoral to act on this with rash extremism.
The ACA has saved American lives. Please vote No.  Save more Americans.
Joni: Look at all these veterans in need of healthcare! Let's cut programs veterans and civilians lives depend on! Fuck off you POS.
Please vote NO on the latest version of TrumpCare 2.0. If this passes, the vets you claim to care about so much will lose coverage.
Agree! If @SenJoniErnst really cares about fellow veterans, she'll vote NO on #GrahamCasiddy. She didn't care enough to vote NO last time.
Iowa, this is what one of your Senators said about #GrahamCassidy.  Tell Sen Ernst, that isn't good enough. Vote No.
Amazing quote from @ChuckGrassley here: Despite many reasons to oppose Graham-Cassidy, GOP must support it to uphold campaign promises. 
vote No #GrahamCassidyDeathBill #VoteNOGrahamCassidy then update that resume.
How about standing up for them and Iowans!
Vote her out in 2020 she wants to take healthcare away from 30 million of us and doom millions of us to death.
Will you stand up for them and vote NO on health care bill?
said on tv, she will support the Graham-Cassidy Bill. Get ready Iowans, you are about the be bent over and not even get a kiss. VOTE HER OUT
1.75 M vets covered by Medicaid
340k are covered by ACA
Many have PECs to increase premiums
Don't vote against vets

Senator Ernst, millions of honorable military veterans, some disabled like me, NEED Medicaid. VA does not provide many services we need.
Some “veteran”... NONE fly the flag that that. How disgraceful & disrespectful!!!
Trucker Jeff needs a civics lesson it seems. Disgraceful!
CEO of America's Health Insurance Plans OPPOSES Graham Cassidy for destabilizing ind. markets & pullback of pre-exist. conditions protection

Kill the bill. Its .
As a woman, please vote no to this murderously cruel Cassidy/Graham bill.

Nobody wants Graham/Cassidy bill, not patients, not doctors, not hospitals. Why is GOP pushing the cruel & heartless bill? VOTE NO!
They ALL OPPOSE Cassidy Graham!  Please vote no to this horrendous legislation!
GC bill goes far beyond Skinny bill! It is the complete wiping out of FEDERAL protections for pre-existing conditions. PLEASE VOTE NO!
Lifetime caps, annual caps, charging older people HUGE $$$- the greatest hits of Trumpcare - all back again in #GrahamCassidy. VOTE NO!
#GrahamCassidy eliminates protections for people w/pre-existing conditions. GONE! Insurers back to denying coverage for the sick. VOTE NO!
ARE YOU LISTENING JONI?
Under Cassidy/Graham Federal protection of NOT charging exorbitant rates 4 preexisting conditions is GONE!  I will go BANKRUPT!  VOTE NO!
You do remember Clinton county IA? Part of your district?
Then explain why you support the #GrahamCassidyBill 's cuts to Medicaid, which 1.75 million veterans depend on as a source of coverage.
Hey Joni, it was really good to see you came to Clinton to address our opioid crisis 

... Oh wait
