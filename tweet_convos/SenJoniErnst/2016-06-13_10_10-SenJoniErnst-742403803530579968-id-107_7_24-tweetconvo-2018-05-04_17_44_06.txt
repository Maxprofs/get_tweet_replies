One way to protect citizens - don't let #Terrorists buy assault weapons to kill us.  Ban the @NRA for supporting terrorists
: did you know 33,000 Americans die PER YEAR from gun shots? What is your plan to address that?! #WheresTheBill #EndNRA
Hypocritical don't you think ? You can't even support gay men in the service
So why did you vote against background checks? Thanks @harto for letting me know about this.
You are bought by the NRA and you have lost my vote
that's just ridiculous.  Seriously. .
Could you be more hypocritical? Shame on you
So vote YES on 551. If folks are on terrorist watch lists, they shouldn't be allowed to buy guns.
.@SenJoniErnst More guns as an answer to epidemic gun violence is like saying more cigarettes will cure your lung cancer.
but not too much...or @nra won't give you money. Right?
Blood of this tragedy is on your hands.You do NOTHING to stop these events from happening. How much NRA$$ are US lives worth?!
maybe the #GOP should stop arming domestic terrorists. Ban Assault Rifles, Close Loopholes, Background Cks all sales
Thanks to a loophole, suspected terrorists can legally buy guns in US. Close it now:
best way to defeat terrorism is gun control. Why won't you work for that?
SHAME ON YOU #Enough #EnoughGunViolence #OrlandoUnited #OrlandoStrong #WeAreOrlando @MomsDemand @NRA
So how about you vote to NOT let those investigated by the FBI buy guns? How about you vote FOR background checks?
.@SenJoniErnst 2. "Doing more" would involve doing your job - changing your stance on laws which allow this to happen. YOU need to do more.
.@SenJoniErnst 1. This statement doesn't mention anything about LGBT people who this hate crime was directed towards.
You're despicable...Why not start by giving back the money the NRA gave you?
try your famed castration technique on the NRA. DO YOUR JOB.
start by joining @ChrisMurphyCT and fighting for gun reform.
You voted against the No fly No buy bill which would've prevented terrorists from buying guns. HOW ARE U FIGHTING terrorism??
why didn't you mention the LGBT community? Wouldn't that have shown integrity and kindness?
By banning assault rifles and strengthening gun laws? Because that will do more than thoughts and prayers.
U voted against legislation that would have stopped #OrlandoNightclubShooting #BloodIsOnYourHands
I guess you must think we we arm them ll they might shoot themselves
Yeah, and maybe stop hating on the LGBT community too.
You took millions of #NRA $. HYPOCRITE. BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS NOW, otherwise you're ONLY pandering for attention w #filibuster
.@SenJoniErnst 80+ people die fr gun violence every day. Congress shld have acted after #SandyHook #Charleston etc. Why do you defend NRA?
Joni, breathe. Now listen. He was a man full of self hate & loathing and had easy access to AK's. Just like a terrorist does
@Debi129 head back to hog castrating and let someone who'll vote against assault rifles for civilians take office.
the real problem is why the hell was he able to purchase an assault weapon that is meant for the battlefield? #GunControlNow
This would be a good time to shush and hang your head in shame for taking all that NRA $$$.
@SenJoniErnst
You are going to look the fool again. Seems the shooter was angry, violent, gay man with a crazy father.
Geez wake up! This wasn't terrorist by Jhadi it's a sick gay who couldn't come out so he took his like & 49 others HATE CRIME
Go butcher some hogs for your buddy Wayne LaPierre.  Goodness knows he's paid enough to you for thousands of hot skinnings.
stop taking money from the NRA. Biblical definitions would make you a prostitute, trading favors for money.
yes, like the homegrown domestic terrorism that breeds in your hateful words.  Please vote this fool out of office.
That statement is worthless. How about starting with abolishing assault weapons? Are you afraid of the NRA?
Protecting the Homeland is a must!!!
$3million NRA $$ was almost a third of ur entire campaign budget. U seem to b a good investment for them.
LOL. Riiiight.
.@SenJoniErnst this pathetic excuse for a human was born in America though. What're you planning to do to keep us safe at home?
So how about banning people on terrorist watch list from buying guns?
The 5,900 Americans killed by Americans this year say hello.
This pissed off Iowa voter demands gun control NOW!  Talk is cheap, stop taking #NRA money and DO YOUR JOB!!
It was a crime against people who attend gay nightclubs
The guy was not white, so It was terrorism
White guy- mental health
Actually, it underscores the need for universal background checks on all gun sales. DO YOUR JOB so we can stop counting bodies
thank you for your point it's spot on if they would have blocked his right they would complain profiling
Madame, the terrorists are the likes of yourself & the NRA
start by not selling assault rifles to nut jobs and terrorists. Then get off the NRA teat!!
.@SenJoniErnst The guy decided he was an Islamic terrorist an hour into the killings, but ppl like u let him buy guns in the 10 yrs b4 that
Bought.
CLOWN
@Debi129 is she wearing her bread wrapper shoes this evening?
This to, eject calf from the union of America .
Political correctness they say . Do your job in DC , impeach all of them.
do more by saying #FuckTheNRA
<=== human trash that helps the NRA protect terrorists access to military weapons
terrorism?! This was a Hate Crime committed by an unstable person on FBI watch list who was allowed to buy an assault rifle.
Sounds like you're enjoying the $2+million the @NRA gave you. Murderer.
Does YOU doing more include no-buy lists and/or background checks? #DoYourJob
I'd say not letting terrorists buy guns IN AMERICA would be a good start. DO SOMETHING TO FIX THIS! #DoYourJob #ForThePeople
…by not letting them get fucking assault weapons
What SPECIFICALLY are you going to do? Continue to line your pockets with NRA money and "pray"? Weak and ineffective.
Thoughts and prayers, thoughts and prayers...blah blah blah. Nice job trying to frame as terrorist attack-try hate crime.
.@SenJoniErnst Do more? You besides flooding our country with guns? How many more of your solutions can we survive.?
In the Home of the Brave, @SenJoniErnst cannot stand up to a firearms marketing association, instead, she cashes their checks. #p2 @NRA
Sleep well at night on your bed of NRA blood money.
Oh no, Joni! This looks bad!!
.@NRA spent 2.8 MILLION to elect @joniernst in 2014 so gun reform isn't part of her counter-terror strategy  https://twitter.com/SenJoniErnst/status/742403803530579968 …
By we, do you mean you & 49 orher Senators who voted NO to close the terror gap on firearm purchases? @SenJoniErnst
it took the NRA a full day to help you make this tweet?? #NRApaidforyourtweet
why don't you say now is the time for assault riffles to be banned.....oh no you're paid by the @NRA
By doing more, you mean taking another $3 million from the NRA?
@Debi129 maybe she can use a little bit of that money to buy shoes to replace her bread wrappers
"I'm Joni Ernst and the NRA approved this message."
keep doing absolutely nothing about the problem and cashing those checks though!
#HYPOCRITE
Or, YOU could take immediate + effective action HERE by banning sales of AR-15s! But you're in the pocket of the NRA, so nah?
Hope that 2.8 Million in Blood Money feels good from the NRA while the LGBT! community mourns
thoughts and prayers blah blah blah, but no solid actions.. You got nothing here.
Your NRA overlords are happy the person was happy to purchase an assault rifle.  Blood is on your hands
How about making sure those that are on the no-fly list can't purchase weapons? Oh yeah, that was tried, but Republicans nixed
