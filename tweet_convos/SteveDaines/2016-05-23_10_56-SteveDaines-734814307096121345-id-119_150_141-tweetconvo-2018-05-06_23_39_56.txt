@KimHarm0061 @SpeakerRyan @pnehlen
Ryan do you really want blood on your hands America is Awake and Pissed
@SpeakerRyan
he's a democrat
Last time I checked, people complained about the lines at both but only end up getting good service from Disneyland.
yet you haven't moved to remove him from his post. Now is the time Mr. Speaker. He must go!
waiting in line while you're sick not getting taken care of 4 months is like disneyland? #pissOnMeAndCallitRain
let's fire McDonald! https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/fire-robert-mcdonald-secretary-veterans-affairs-and-nominate-james-mattis-his-replacement …
"Hey, veterans! WHAT DAY IS IT? It's 'We Cancelled Your Appointment' DAY!!!"
Send Bob McDonald out for a tour or three, and then interview him about his experiences with the #VA.  I bet his tune changes.
your Tweet was quoted in a story by @washingtonpost
@HealthData4All He's wrong.  @Disney does measure wait times.  Time is important to #pateints too.
Disneyland is better funded than the #VA, thanks to @SpeakerRyan & @McConnellPress. #Vets are rising against #Trump &  #GOP @SykesCharlie
@SpeakerRyan
Can I help you fire this VA Guy? Let me have his job.
@SykesCharlie Seriously, #GOP candidate defrauds vets, so why isn't he castigated, too?
#WheresVet$ #WheresAuditLtr #CAPrimary
@HouseGOP so get something done about it! #VA @realDonaldTrump @VonRJ
@DarrellIssa Outrageous! The man needs to be FIRED ASAP. Insulting to Vets equating their healthcare to a Disney ride.
the longer you talk about it the more doesn't get done Action not rhetoric works better for all involved but that's not you
Just goes to show how delusional BO's administration is & ppl have had enough of typical everyday lame brain dead gov officials
@SykesCharlie what, exactly, have you done about it, Speaker Ryan?  You've been in DC for years. #VA
@SykesCharlie  How do you ask congress to spend more on defense, when your presidential candidates pays no taxes?
If you use Trump's tax money the issue would be solved. There wouldn't be any money for VA Hospitals.Your leader
IM NAHT HAPPPY!!!! Waaaaaaaa! @va
well.. Pentagon got creative with thiers.. Yes i wanna wake up but this no dream and walt didn't make it.
How many yrs vets wait in appeals backlog?Vets die waiting so VA saves money denying vets $$!!
you can pass all  resolutions that you want when is someone going to seriously help these people
Now they're waiting on this
Why don't you give em some MORE tax money, so they can add rides, RINO?!
challenge the VA to devise & report objective metrics of attainment of functional patient outcomes & compare to civ services
@DarrellIssa because they can forgive Israel 9 billion dollars but can't put enough into the men that keep the welfare coming!
My husband literally suffering and dying right in front of us because of the VA I have witnessed first hand abuse of our Vet's
and what have you done to solve the problem at VA since you've been speaker of the house?
@HouseGOP Like your lyin'former president about the STUPID Irak war,messing the middle-East & ISIS creation!
@DarrellIssa Typical liberal attitude!
same line your in to get on the train
, who has kept Republicans waiting for decades for him to belatedly govern as conservative, chastised tardiness of bureaucrats.
@DarrellIssa This veteran's wife can attest the #VA lines are nothing like Disney! What a disgrace!
@DarrellIssa Right?! You can buy a fast pass in Disneyland!
Doesn't this just show the double-dealing BULLSHIT our politicians practice to hoodwink us.
also tell the VA Secretary that Disney DOES indeed measure & inform park users of current park attraction wait times.
you have no clue as to what vets go through
@ChrisCoon4 @deneenborelli @mtrdude Mr. Ryan, this disgraceful person has to go; please give some guidance as to how to help.
That is dumb.
The Audacity of Administrational Power This is exactly why @realDonaldTrump is being nominated Nothing positive gets done in DC
@Uncle_Jimbo if only it was run as efficiently as Disney...
Good grief!

Your do nothing congress has voted against every veterans benefit bill that has come up for a vote, shame on the GOP
how about the Republican Congress actually fund the VA appropriately so veteran's can be taken care of? Instead you play games.
@HouseGOP
@HouseGOP I am poorly educated and I figured out what is the problem why can't you
inexcusable, down right pathetic!! Fire that POS!
Waiting to be seen at a hospital for a medical condition isn't fun and games. Is this man for real?
I agree and I too still wait in "Line"
#VA lines to #disneyland
@HouseGOP I see such a total LACK of common sense in gov't. Shouldn't you be working on FIRING some people?
Sen.Ryan, " What is the status of #TheRealChoiceBill ?"
No, most of us are not satisfied with our health care !
RECKITT-BENCKISER & #BigPharma bribed  VA to disenfranchise vets off opiods for their suboxone ! Veterans are suffering/dying !
~ Sen. Ryan, " There is nothing #MickeyMouse about my 24/7 pain and suffering caused by VA JxFl & VAGvFl !" See prev. comments.
oh ryan, still deflecting.  Show your republican pride and endorse @realDonaldTrump. Put the nail in your political coffin.
Yeah, @PRyan you're proving you need to be replaced ASAP! Offensive and condescending to our #Veterans 

Delete your acct @SpeakerRyan!
That man should be fired!  Why are so many Obama appointees so arrogant?
congress can modify Title 38 anytime it wants. Fixing the VA doesn't seem to be high on Congressional to-do list
he is lying. He must be removed
@HouseGOP so very wrong on many levels.. Pathetic..
IF YOU are truly conservative, get off your backside and nail the VA Sec. Then, endorse Trump who has been SUPPORTING vets.
You failed vets period Get primaried by @pnehlen @SarahPalinUSA @michellemalkin @AnnCoulter @DanScavino
you stood in front of seniors attempting to explain to them why their medicaid + social security should be trashed
cc:@HouseGOP
RESIGN you are not faithful, you failed vets 18 years, its worse than ever. Get primaried by @pnehlen
VA Sec must be formally penalized for his statement. Get rid of this bum immediately!! Our Vets deserve much more.
#TrumpTrain Wisconsin: Vets 4 Nehlen. @pnehlen Why? Paul Ryan failed vets 18 years &will not change
Stop talking and fix it. Give vets who can't see a dr quickly a Medicare Card, waive deductibles and copayments! Now
How many vets bills rotting in Congress why you cry to pass TPA/TPP/TiSA/TTIP
WHERE IS VETS DAILY PRESSER IN YEAR 2016 W/SPEAKER ON VETS CRISIS? RESIGN, GET primaried by @pnehlen You failed us 18 years
And "satisfaction with the experience" includes the wait times in line at Disney.

Please read and share the Shadow party American  communist in Democratic Party
How's it different from the Emergency Room?  You basically have to give up your entire night. All of healthcare needs vetting
C'mon, we all know what he meant, As soon as I read it,I went oh wow..That bad ? that's why I haven't been in years dont pick..
maybe if you had the balls to have an actual Solution you would not have to play these grade school games on Twitter.
.@SpeakerRyan how about an impeachment, bubba?
Get rid of the VA & give our military the healthcare they deserve. Cut the statements & wasted $$ on hearings & "Just do it"!
#VA You're a putz Secretary McDonald. As a twenty year military veteran, I found your remarks offensive - resign now, Sir. @SpeakerRyan
don't forget the GOP senate helped him get that position  97-0
stop talking and start acting, show America you are more than an empty suit.
Yes, but you want to leave in many immigrants that do not assimilate and we cannot and should not take care of.
Then maybe instead of grandstanding, you such actually PASS the veterans bills presented to you.
Disney *does* measure wait times. See for yourself: https://touringplans.com/magic-kingdom/crowd-levels …
Awesome as my husband dies waiting for VA how dare you compare to Disney Karma is a you know Vote @pnehlen
@elyse4design @SpeakerRyan Congress fully funded Obama's budget proposal. #facts are hard for democrats, I know.
Bruce missed that memo.
Blocked because it wasn't paid for and dems refused to allow amendments to fix it. But don't let facts bother you.
Why does investment in the country need to be paid for in advance?
So we don't end up like Greece.
We can't end up like Greece, we control our own currency. That you don't understand that disqualifies you in economics
Rep. House & Senate have control so do something about these people instead of just tweeting about it.
The Dems do not care about our vets. The vets are obstacles to their goals. #NeverDems
