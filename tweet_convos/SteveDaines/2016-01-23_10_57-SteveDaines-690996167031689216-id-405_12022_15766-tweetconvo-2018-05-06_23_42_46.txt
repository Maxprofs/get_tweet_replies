.@GregAbbott_TX 2010 but nice thought.
@wxbrad @GregAbbott_TX the pic acts as a reminder that soldiers are currently out there. It reminded me. Doesn't matter when it was taken.
@J_ChoMetheMoney @GregAbbott_TX totally agree but it was posted as current storm & hashtagged as #jonasblizzard
@GregAbbott_TX  Pandering. They are there every day. You only choose to notice when you think it will score you points.
@GregAbbott_TX @healthandcents thank our loved soldiers  n u for sharing

@GregAbbott_TX If I lived in DC, I'd have gone to watch so they wouldn't be alone.

@GregAbbott_TX might want to check your image sources. That's from 2010. SMH!
@GregAbbott_TX @BretBaier This soldier shows more hutzpah than his President! If only he had a CiC worthy of such dedication!
@GregAbbott_TX congress should learn from this. never stop trying to work together for a more perfect unity.
@GregAbbott_TX @brentdougherty amazing..
@GregAbbott_TX thinks dude guarding the #TombOfTheUnknownSoldier should hand it over to #securitycams and get out of #blizzard2016. #ijs
@GregAbbott_TX My heart is full of pride and prayer for these brave and honorable soldiers. God bless & keep them safe.
@GregAbbott_TX @wcmethvin "Noli me tangere"

Usually the Snow Jobs come out of Washington DC and cover the rest of America...

Except Texas, of course
@GregAbbott_TX ...for all those who enjoy FREEDOM w/o any offered compromises; This is Love of Country, Self & COMMITMENT  @JesusNarrowWay
@GregAbbott_TX @TheChadColby govt being closed might not be so bad less chance to screw things up
@GregAbbott_TX See the response this tweet got. Now you know how little support you have for everything you're doing. #txlege
@GregAbbott_TX LOVE YOU EVERYONE honoring what used to be a GREAT NATION but now tossed to rabid dogs!
@GregAbbott_TX Another great military post by a chicken hawk.
@GregAbbott_TX @tedcruz YOU KEEP ON ROW TEXEN, JUST KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE 8 BALL...IT ROW AWAY, FROM IF YOU DON'T WATCH THESE SON OF GUNS.
@GregAbbott_TX @BretBaier If it is closed who took the photo?

@GregAbbott_TX this is the true spirit of the American Fighting Man THAT'S WHY THIS COUNTRY WILL NEVER FALL TO ANYONE!!!! ANYONE!!!!!!!
@GregAbbott_TX

I was there before seeing JFK's eternal flame at Arlington. Its super human.
@GregAbbott_TX Very nice
@GregAbbott_TX God bless them all for their service!!!
@GregAbbott_TX It takes them 3 hours to set up their uniform - every. Single. Day.
@GregAbbott_TX Exactly Governor Abbott. They never do.
@GregAbbott_TX @tedcruz Bless those wonderful men.
@GregAbbott_TX @BretBaier God Bless them! They should receive national media coverage...dream on!
@GregAbbott_TX In the meantime, how many homeless veterans are out there buried in the snow because of republican cuts?
@GregAbbott_TX @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump But cruz has when they retire & need medical care. Illegal aliens & refugees come first with cruz.
@GregAbbott_TX @SoxOnTheBrain dead troops are the best because they don't complain about homelessness or cuts in VA health care. Right, Gov?
@GregAbbott_TX wish i lived close by i stand along side this man #SaulteSolider
@GregAbbott_TX @BretBaier That is so amazing!!
@GregAbbott_TX God Bless our American soldiers..those who have fallen and those who serve now, even in the worse of times. #angelsinarmor

@GregAbbott_TX live you guys and you are the best
@GregAbbott_TX @KarenWeekly Awesome
@GregAbbott_TX As if you cared about soldiers. You were suspicious of them during 'Jade Helm,' remember? 
@GregAbbott_TX God bless them!!!!
@GregAbbott_TX @tedcruz #HONOR
@GregAbbott_TX @MillsapsMLax Thanks Gov. Abbott!! The Lone Star State Rocks!
@GregAbbott_TX @tedcruz maybe you could send raphael to do the job - he is not accomplishing much else - like you unless suing is an art.
@GregAbbott_TX Bow you want to honor them with a misleading photo? What about Your Jade Helm foolishness? You sir are an ass
@GregAbbott_TX You need to take this old photo down sir. It's sad that the individuals we elect use untruths to mislead the American people.
@GregAbbott_TX First, it's not a photo taken today. Second,  you don't support our troops but dispatch your "Texas Guard" to monitor them .
@gregabbott_tx he"ll freeze to death..!!!!
@GregAbbott_TX Interesting, but I'd rather see a picture from this storm. This photo is from 2010.
http://www.aloneandunafraid.com/blog/P20/ 
.@GregAbbott_TX You really should credit the photo (and it's 2010): http://www.aloneandunafraid.com/blog/detail/an_honor_like_no_other/ …

@GregAbbott_TX @Fitzzer777 @Senate_GOPs @GOP have been shutdown for last 7 1/2 yrs by @potus so snow can't be any worse!
@GregAbbott_TX @CaptianCarry 
Those men Rock! PERIOD
@GregAbbott_TX these are the kinds of values that make America great. Sadly, fewer and fewer people in this country agree with me on that
@GregAbbott_TX too bad their government quits them.
@GregAbbott_TX @tedcruz Our fallen heros deserve the honor 24-7-365
@GregAbbott_TX @tedcruz True Heroes never do!
@GregAbbott_TX @BretBaier If this picture doesn't move you, you are undoubtedly a democrat.
@GregAbbott_TX God bless and keep those who watch over our honored dead. That is worthy of praise.

@GregAbbott_TX Makes me so proud to be an American and how proud all of us should be of our military men and women. God bless them!
@GregAbbott_TX I am so proud and honored to be an AMERICAN. Wonderful men
@GregAbbott_TX God bless him!
@GregAbbott_TX @KeeslingMary #Respect #Humbled
@GregAbbott_TX @tedcruz Thank God and bless everyone of those brave members of the Old Guard.
@GregAbbott_TX @CardinalJim1 the changing of the guard is an amazing experience! Witnessed it during a thunderstorm and they never flinched.
@GregAbbott_TX @tedcruz 

BRAVO ZULU........!
@GregAbbott_TX @whitewolfdown ...Most restricted and demanding personal standards in the military.
@GregAbbott_TX @tedcruz If only our government were this dedicated to this country.  How great would that be?
