World powers have made far-reaching concessions in all areas that were supposed to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapons capability.
@netanyahu Tell your Fundamentalist friends here in US #Israel needs Obama for another term or two, maybe more, with J. Kerry as his VP.
@benlow9575 @netanyahu HEY BILL, ARE YOU FOR REAL?
@elohimis1 @netanyahu R' bank prints up what's needed. Generals & Admirals get paid several times more than corporals & privates.
@benlow9575 @netanyahu DO YOU THINK THE RESONSABILITY AND EDUCATION LEVEL WARRANTS A HIGHER PAY SCALE? WE ALL HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY!
@elohimis1 @netanyahu I had way more education than my dad and never could make near as much as he could. What do u think that makes me?
@benlow9575 @netanyahu YOU HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES. WHY HAVEN'T YOU PURSUED THEM?
@netanyahu  our president is an idiot we are sorry
@TheIntelSaviors @netanyahu  so why don't you enlighten me how I'm an informed
@TheIntelSaviors @netanyahu  becuase this does not stop iran from getting nukes this does nothing its a joke
@TheIntelSaviors @netanyahu it doesn't allow for inspections the iAEA can make a request and the Iranians have 14 days to say yes or no
@netanyahu They have committed Treason.
@USA_Infidel3 @netanyahu At least Jimmy Carter won't have to worry about people complaining about HIS disastrous foreign policy.
@GreggPruitt @netanyahu Yep! I hate to say this but Jimmy looks innocent in comparison to that Radical Islamist in the White Mosque!  (sigh)
@USA_Infidel3 @GreggPruitt so what about the whole of Europe who favour this deal and the Russians are they   Islamists?
@DavidD121 @USA_Infidel3 I don't sleep easier knowing Putin is happy about anything. You may. I don't. Largest terrorism sponsor gets $$$
@GreggPruitt @USA_Infidel3 all those countries in the Middle East sponsor terrorism. 9/11 hijackers were all from SA
@DavidD121 @GreggPruitt No s*it sherlock!!!!
@USA_Infidel3 @GreggPruitt hey asshole don't you have a gun to go and buy.
@netanyahu OBozo is an Idiot, Bibi, but you knew that. I voted against him in both elections, but that's all I could do.
@BachelorTrek @netanyahu We should be bombing them toward to the 8th century.
@Craigthepatriot I've blocked more idiots than I ever have today.
@BachelorTrek Same Here-The maggots seem to be streaming out of the rotten meat of progressivism.
@netanyahu @KarenDoe50 we can only hope congress doesn't approve. Need to know details of the deal
@jboraski55 @KarenDoe50 @netanyahu the POS will veto congress anyhow
@chrgdup1973 @KarenDoe50 @netanyahu not sure how this works..
@jboraski55 @KarenDoe50 @netanyahu how things r "supposed" to work hasn't mattered to this admin. He'll veto congress for sure!
@chrgdup1973 @KarenDoe50 @netanyahu you are so right!! Laws mean nothing to this a-hole . and he gets away with it!
@netanyahu @JeffreyGuterman #PEACE PREVAILS #40Traitors Lose #Cotton Lose+#BOEHNER=Lose #AMERICAN& #IRAN PEOPLE=*WIN*
@netanyahu Maybe speaking with our Congress again will help your position.  What if Obama did that to you?
@netanyahu You and your cabinet consider my President to be "black and weak".   Maybe spending more time talking with him would have been.
@netanyahu @DLSteadman God bless & protect Israel.  Treacherous Barack Hussein Obama proves he's exactly what some Americans said he was.
@CatatonicSpine @netanyahu @DLSteadman What Marie? Can't remember? Can't spell it? Guess Obama will just have to put the NRA on it.
@Morgana378 @netanyahu @DLSteadman Have no idea who you are or what you're talking about Mr. Gregory
@CatatonicSpine @Morgana378 @netanyahu He is a troll, just block him.  Please do not feed the simpleton and don't cast your pearls b4 swine
@DLSteadman @netanyahu Lol He's blocked. I had just blocked some German Mkt. acct., so Twitter asked ?'s abt this guy.  Obamaite I guess!
@CatatonicSpine @netanyahu Just someone who needs attention
@netanyahu @CharnockWade @RichardRSmithJr This is like handing nuclear weapons to Isis Iran is the state sponsor of terrorism horrible deal.
@KenistonHeather in fact iran is fighting against ISIS! how you came up with this story??
@DrRashkola @netanyahu How about you FOAD?! POS
@netanyahu YEAH! We learned that when saving You all from the Nazy! Big mistake!!!!!!!
@netanyahu @Atkinson4459 I am not leaving this dealership without a new car!  Now... let's talk price...
@netanyahu @Christernets highest order !
@netanyahu @Christernets says the man who has secretly produced nuclear weapons, will not allow UN inspectors in & refuses to sign nuclear
@netanyahu Shalom Alechem .. Shalom
@netanyahu The existence of Israel is a historic mistake...
@netanyahu @congressdotgov #Election2016 Obama loves himself more than America / Israel; putting his 'legacy' ahead of our nations security.
@netanyahu @Rockprincess818 The Imam Obama is our historic mistake. Innocent people are going to suffer due to his immaturity & ego.
. @netanyahu @ezralevant ......with any luck the bomb will go off when they build one.......
@netanyahu I'm so sorry For what has happened today. I will pray for the safety of Israel.
@netanyahu After establishing his credentials with a fat boy, General Semantics will make Iran smoke a whole pack of nukes.
@netanyahu your pathetic birth, life, country, crimes, genocide and your zionist Brain have been a Historic Mistake !
@netanyahu 
I agree. 
The return of the Messiah draws near. Mark 13:7, Matthew 24:6
Be encouraged. God is near and will deliver His people.
@netanyahu @manofmesa
@netanyahu @ResistTyranny go alone because America is not with you thanks to our President. It's sickening
@netanyahu @TonyDuheaume why don't you do something about it,you are in a position to do so-you have resources-lets see how sincere!
@netanyahu If you wanted peace quit settlements
@netanyahu the only deal I see is#1 keep Iranian busy!! #2 have enough cash to spread terror all over the world starts from Iran first.
@netanyahu A historic mistake? The only historic mistake is you ever being PM of Israel.
@netanyahu
@netanyahu @MolonLabe1776us Well, we have a historically poor excuse for a president...an idiotic,  self-absorbed, USA & Israel hater.
@netanyahu interesting how you denounce a 100 pages agr.  before it was finished/released. You are a men from the last century.  #IranDeal
Let us just hope that Iran knows the fallout will come back to them if they attack Israel. God will protect you.@netanyahu @MolonLabe1776us
@netanyahu @MolonLabe1776us
@netanyahu @MolonLabe1776us
@netanyahu The American People stand with you. We are embarassed by our current "leaders"! #RedNationRising
@netanyahu @FeistyIrishKat ALLOWING THIS #TERRORIST TO REMAIN IN THE WHITE HOUSE IS THE BIGGER MISTAKE !

@FeistyIrishKat @netanyahu OH MAN....I AM RIGHT THERE WITH YOU KAT !  IVE HAD IT !

@netanyahu @mlong42947 AMERICAN PATRIOTS HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THIS EVIL @ 1600 B4 HIS "ELECTION"! WE R BATTLEWEARY BUT KNOW GODiswithUS&ISRAEL
The historic mistake was not once but twice electing Obama. @netanyahu @3sons4me2
@5sahandful @netanyahu @3sons4me2 #insanity
“@LucidHurrricane: @netanyahu Please know the American PEOPLE stand with you.”
@netanyahu Obama is a historic mistake!
@netanyahu Certainly it can be said to be so. World is full of them.

BTW? How's that Jerusalem as Israel's Capitol working out for ya?
@netanyahu "EARLY REPORTS"? Benyamin, come out from underneath the rock, read the ACTUAL AGREEMENT. It's OK to know what one's speaking of.
@netanyahu NOT a MISTAKE! It aDone deal from the side of strength and done by people who knows it positive impart to middle-east/world PEACE
@netanyahu Yes it's a horrible thing, BUT GOD has chosen a destiny for You. ISRAEL IS FOREVER!!!! Glory to God!!
@netanyahu @dhb7 Well hopefully BiBi WILL PISS ON OHAMAS PARADE!!
@netanyahu @jan_pierce I guess our president wants to bring Psalm 83 and Psalm 2 about quicker, it is against his friends!
@bmenyhert @dkdk459 @netanyahu Lets hope Israel wipe them off the map!
@chezamission @bmenyhert @netanyahu I would blame them to set the whole country on fire. Israel seems to be in great danger.
@chezamission @bmenyhert @netanyahu I would absolutely jump for joy. Israel is backed into a corner. 100% BO's fault. Legacy over humanity!
@netanyahu Well Obama always does stupid things and is always helping our enemies. I never voted for him. Too many ignorants did.
@netanyahu @DanWantsFreedom Our apologies for the President, Mr. PM. I didn't vote for him. Now u know why his symbol is a jackass.
@netanyahu @donnatobia I totally agree.
@netanyahu the American people are so sorry our presidents a idiot.
@netanyahu Yet again, we have appeased people who wish to rid the world of the Jewish people. God wont be happy that we have abandoned you.
@netanyahu @1776Sorores 
The USA electing @BarackObama TWICE was also an historic mistake
@netanyahu USA to Germany: Greece ¿? Germany, allied. To Russia: Syria ¿? Russia, allied. British ¿? #EU referendum. Allied or neutral ¿?
@netanyahu Israel has proven to the world that it can't be trusted to start WWIII with it's illegal Nuclear Weapons
@netanyahu I am an American with roots in Israel that completely agrees.  Stay strong!
@netanyahu @cccele4eva true Americans know it's huge mistake We still stand with Israel. Ashamed of our leaders here. God bless USA & Israel
@netanyahu We are praying. Know that God IS in control. He will not let His nation, Israel fall. Sorry our leaders here are inept.
@netanyahu 
Its a historic decision and will be a game changer and historic mistake is Israel have nukes
@netanyahu you're a historic mistake.
@netanyahu Mr Prime Minister, please drop the scare-tactics. It's not beneficial for Israel. Send a diplomat to Iran asap instead
@netanyahu @shim_rational As an American, all I can say is I'm sorry. I have a feeling that this will come back to bite us.
@netanyahu Peace in our time..
@netanyahu #USA [ || || ] Syria [|||||] #Russia 

#Chess

Greece ///--__ | __--\\\

#WWIII
@netanyahu from what I can tell there are time lines that expire thus it is a temporary agreement. Not a good idea.
@netanyahu @ChristiChat All the left wing Jewish groups won't be happy until there is a mushroom cloud over Tel-Aviv!!
@netanyahu I'm so sorry, both of our country's will pay for this.
@netanyahu Then you should have been at the table to make it work. I think no matter what happened you were not going to be happy.
@netanyahu as a American i will give my last breath to help protect the nation of Israel. I am ashamed our gov. Has turned it's back on U
@netanyahu @LindaSuhler I wish it were a mistake. This was deliberate.
@netanyahu 
Time for Israel to begin "negotiations" with Iran.
@netanyahu @HangEmHigh69 #IranDeal has opened its doors to World, when are you going 2 open #Dimona 4 Inspection? #SamsonOption to nuke ALL!
@netanyahu/  So SORRY!  God has dealt with men like this since SIN began! IE: "I will keep him in PERFECT PEACE whose mind is stayed on me"!
@netanyahu We MUST cry aloud unto Holy G-d for divine intervention, & we SHALL have it.  Israel&America are forever.  No daylight between us
@netanyahu Bibi, stop the war mongering. It's over. And, you know it.
@netanyahu It IS historic mistake and so is the out of control supreme court ruling in legislating against natural law. Only God can save us
@netanyahu >>>this is a good deal...quiet please..
@netanyahu The world has just become a more dangerous place. HaShem will watch over Israel! I fear the USA is in real trouble.
@netanyahu, you are a historic mistake.
@netanyahu @ScotsFyre Can someone, anyone please escort Obama back to Kenya? Pretty please!!! #CCOT
@netanyahu I fear that Israel may one day stand alone except for God..I pray that God grant you the ability to guide & protect your people.
@netanyahu You are as sorry a leader as there ever was in the History of the world. You have the bomb and you have the GOP in your pocket.
@netanyahu @ScotsFyre The American people are so so sorry. We know who our leaders are. TRAITORS TO US AND TO ISRAEL.
@netanyahu Notwithstanding the current Obama administration, America still stands with Israel @Tabitha__Lily
@netanyahu I wouldn't blame you to team up with Putin roll into Iran take out isis & the Iranian gov't #IStandWithIsrael
@netanyahu You are a mistake.
@netanyahu shut up!
@netanyahu you too are an historic mistake - but life goes on!
@netanyahu @clantro Call your senators and congressmen and squash this now! Go!

http://m.house.gov/representatives/ …
Only way to undo this and change direction is to punish Dems in 2016. @bobbyelesky @netanyahu http://www.lifezette.com/lifezette/bolton-congress-cant-stop-iran-deal/ …
@clantro @netanyahu I'm voting "Trump"
It's way to early to hitch our wagons to one horse this early. Primaries and debates will change things @bobbyelesky @netanyahu
@clantro @netanyahu I'm free to change my wagon at anytime. Right now I like the one I'm on & hope to stay here,but one never knows for sure
@netanyahu Quit your whining.
@netanyahu You are biased, War Criminal.
@netanyahu Obama has been such an embarrassment to this country! He is grasping for anything and the world knows it.
@netanyahu You are an absolute moron! Go dig a hole and crawl in it please. Doesn't fit in the money making business of war?
@netanyahu @maxxgadog A historic mistake indeed, but only behind the historic mistake of electing Barak H. Obama! #baddeal #totallyscrewed
@netanyahu Just because it didn't benefit you personally doesn't mean it's a bad deal. Beneficial for the world, not your agenda #IranDeal
@netanyahu Could you please stop your dogmatic demagoguery. This is not a "deal at any cost". Both sides made concessions. #Iran
@netanyahu @JohnGGalt Iran knows @POTUS will not do anything when Iran breaks the agreement. Every red line has gone unanswered.
@netanyahu Psalm 121 ><> 4 Behold, HE that keepeth Israel, will neither slumber nor sleep.
@netanyahu & you thought Obama was on your side! HA! He pulled the wool over more than stupid Americans' eyes eh? @_Holly_Renee
@netanyahu  Bibi, has there been ANY peace agreement which you haven't complained about?  Your country wouldn't exist without U.S. support.
@netanyahu @William90517519 Did anyone think it wuld be a good deal? Obama and cronies clearly hate USA and Israel. God help his sold soul.
@raineybuck420 @netanyahu This morning "Special Report" historical Iran deal. How it is good for Obama's legacy. Almost lost my breakfast.
@William90517519 @netanyahu Has anyone told Obama that Satan will collect on his soul? This is certain. He will pay the piper.
@raineybuck420 @netanyahu I believe that he sold his soul to the"Devil" when he became president. I believe there is only one "true judge".
@netanyahu Do you really want peace? I doubt about it..5 times since 1992 falsely asserted Iran..
@netanyahu You want a war with Iran you fight it, fuckhead.
@netanyahu Worst joke ever. No punch line. Get new material.
@netanyahu Obama just fire the first nuke, as  if he would have pushed the button himself.  Our country stands with Israel. God protect us
@netanyahu you're a historic mistake smh
@netanyahu Kerry/Obama were desperate for a deal, and Iran was desperate to have sanctions lifted and will never honor anything included
@netanyahu You're a "historic mistake"
@netanyahu Real Americans have your back. Sorry you have to deal with our biggest mistake, Barrack Obama.
@netanyahu fuck you. We don't need reactionary warmongers like you.
.@netanyahu Those in glass houses...
@netanyahu @PastorMattHagee my heart weeps for what the USA has done. I'm so sorry, Mr. Netanyahu. I stand with Israel.
@netanyahu let's kick their asses
@netanyahu @geertwilderspvv it is an historic mistake to put you in the promise land.
@netanyahu  Obama is a historic mistake to the US and world. Arrogant and ignorant voters can be thanked for that.
@netanyahu hahaha apply cold water to the burnt area !!!
@netanyahu  long live peace! I know you're against it...
@netanyahu And Americans still held against their will in Iran... #FreeAmir
@netanyahu So sorry to hear that Israel lost another opportunity to see US dragged into another ME war for you to enjoy!
@netanyahu Allowing you to do as you please has been an historic mistake for over 60 years now Bibi!
@netanyahu any plan to sign any nuclear nonproliferation treaties anytime soon?
.@netanyahu if you're gonna pout, then be a big boy and return that $3B in aid
@netanyahu "historic"  It's what this admin is all a out ... historic mistakes.
@Netanyahu please know that most Americans know this too and most of us agree with you. @glorytooneking
@netanyahu @gcs_singh Please come to the U.S. again and address both houses of Congress! We need you Mr. Prime Minister!
@DaveGrimme @netanyahu I feel this like the emergency that was in the time of Queen Ester.Need to #PrayforAmerica #IStandWithIsrael
@netanyahu the people of Israel are practical, intelligent, and most important of all united. That is where Israel 's strength comes from.
@netanyahu @CrimsonHotMess What do you expect from a community organizer?
@netanyahu @laurenskywalker Netanyahu is one of the few world leaders with any Balls . An actual warrior who the West should listen to.
@frankrmcc I agree wholeheartedly.
@netanyahu @WayneDupreeShow Forgive me but what are the Cititizens of the USA getting in this deal?
@netanyahu our president is an idiot. very sorry.
@netanyahu Sir, You are an incredibly strong and faithful leader. I stand w/U as so many Americans do. Do what you must to protect Israel!
@netanyahu i am with you on this.. i hope you told obama off.. a big mistake for you and usa.
@netanyahu I agree Netanyahu my apologies for their ignorance we shall pray.
@netanyahu Treaty reached by world powers not just US Israel has to compromise. Liberate Gaza concentration camp
.@netanyahu @instapundit If you like your Tel Aviv, you can keep your Tel Aviv.
.@netanyahu Zionism is the historical mistake! #IranDeal is a victory for world peace & security. #ThereWillBeHaters
Nasrallah: “A rich & strong Iran will be able to stand by its friends, especially the resistance in Palestine, more than any time in past.”
Ask Chamberlain“@netanyahu: When willing to make a deal at any cost, this is the result...” #Iranhaswon MT
@netanyahu Early reports are not an indicator of the potential success of a program.  This deal is a step towards peace. :-) #nostatusquo
@netanyahu your lack of willingness to wage peace disturbs me #givepeaceachance
@netanyahu You are an international embarrassment, as are all the Israel-Firsters in my country, the US.
@netanyahu You are so right, this is a horrible tragedy waiting to happen.
@netanyahu And what about your nuclear arsenal?
@netanyahu If Israel who owns US has a right to the bomb and no country could destroy it why not Iran which was attacked by Iraq
@netanyahu You are the mistake!
