.@SenateMajLdr @AP GOP is beyond despicable, playing cynical political games with the lives of helpless babies. Morally unfit to govern.

Oh Yeah 
Why on earth can't GOP have a clean bill to deal with a crisis to women and infants?I hold GOP responsible for this!
AND hold the media accountable if they give the GOP a get out of jail pass.
@SenateGOP @AP And you won't vote on the vote to bring to a vote, oh is trump worthy? #MarbelMouthMitch,
@JohnCornyn @AP You booby trapped the bill with attacks on Planned Parenthood and Obamacare, and now you're blaming Dems?!?
@sherrilee7 @SenateMajLdr @JohnCornyn @AP They're so arrogant to try to ay the American people like this & not think we'll respond
GOP CRYBABY SORE LOSERS TRYING TO BLOCK WE THE PEOPLES CHOICE. U MUST FORGET U WERE ELECTED, BUT NEVER AGAIN TRUMP OR ISIS
CLEAN Zika bill w/ no partisan amendments attached. This is ALL VOTERS lives at stake. DO YOUR DAMN JOB!
Why did the GOP cut birth control funding for Puerto Rico, hard hit by Zika? That's why they blocked it. #NRAownedGOP
Because U packed damn bill w shit that doesn't belong in it. SHAME!!- TY @ChrisMurphyCT 4 heads up
@SenateGOP @AP  Repeating lies doesn't make them more true.
hey Sen. McConnell please support Trump so we can live. Please get all the communists in gov out. http://discoverthenetworks.org 
trying to hide the defunding of women's health in the #zika funding is reprehensible @SCOTUS has ruled.
We need a clean Zika bill with nothing attached to it. Why can't that get done?
@usatodayhealth Still Trying To Get Rid of Planed Parent Hood, Slipped It In The Bill McConnell Why Ur Out of Order U GOPs
Don't you dare surrender to their terms again. Make them blink for once.
This says GOP added provisions having nothing to do with Zika 
BTW, why do you get 7-wk vacations? 
@SenateMajLdr #DoYourJob 
@CNN @MSNBC
Oh no! Hope no @SenateDems get bit by a mosquito! Let's find a way to get this done!
All GOP would have to do is cut the "pork" attached to the Zika funding bill...
The @SenateDems problem with the bill is that it cuts the pork they want.
hasn't the gop realized that the base can't keep them in power?  The rest are watching you and we know better.
@SenateGOP @AP Dem r  busy to enjoy the publicity of gun control at an Graphic Rate Mr McConnell Global threat zika don't matr
@SenateGOP @AP With good reason you deceitful jerk!
@JohnCornyn @AP stop trying to defund planned parenthood and pass a fucking bill then.
@SenateDems
The GOP #Zika bill steals money from the #Ebola response fund, even though we still have 75 CDC staff on ground fighting the outbreak.
@SenateDems
4 months ago, the @WhiteHouse requested $1.9B to fight #Zika. Dems asked the GOP to act – and the GOP dragged their feet.
@SenateDems if you wanted it to pass you wouldn't have attached other items you know dems won't vote for. Good try
Why is there stuff in this bill about flags and unborn babies whom you obviously don't care about.
@SteveDaines @AP You packed the bill with anti-planned parenthood provisions.  Dems were right again.
Cut the moronic partisan politics and pass a CLEAN zika bill.  Do America a favor for a change.  We are disgusted.
Because of dealing with pregnancy, right?  You can't  stomach a role for @PPact when addressing pregnancy & #Zika, right?
Crapo, McCaskill support #NPDES fix.  http://ow.ly/ErTw301FB6g . Please support their bipartisan legislation in conference!
@SteveDaines @AP Complete misrepresentation of the vote.
@SenateGOP 
#ZikaVirus is too important for your abortion games! Put up a clean bill for #Zika funding.
@AP @SenateDems
The problem I have with the GOP is your self interest over the good of the country!Shame on you! 7week vacation from what?
@SenateGOP @AP and this is the party of the people I don't think so
@SenateDems just cause u keep tweeting something, doesn't make it less of a spin. Get the amendments out, bill sails thru!
@SenateGOP @AP @SenateDems Its a race against time to find a cure for Zinka. Next move a vaccine.
The active ingredient for the cure for Zika is Zinc. Now for a vaccine for Zika
your friends want #confederateflag at military cemeteries aging I know what was in the #zikabill

@SenateMajLdr @AP
@McConnellPress @AP @SenateDems actually it is all the #pork you #pigs added to it.  #asshats and #jackasses
Hey Mitch! What are you doing to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns and killing 49 people?
"#Senate Democrats block pork-laden GOB #Zika funding bill written 6 mo after urgent call for funding by @POTUS"   FTFY
@SenateGOP @AP Why are you putting substance in the bill that has nothing to do with the issue? I want u all to stop doing it
Agents have to what up with me, if you keep playing these games u ant gon think the Summons are funny
@SenateDems Do they want money for Planned Parenthood to be able to offer girls to kill their babies with Zika? SICKENING
@SenateDems Unacceptable ! They will let this spread like a plague and let babies die! It is going to cost them
@SenateGOP @AP NO McConnell who switched the votes this time prof is in the putting you sir did
Confederate flag is critical to curing Zika? I am just guessing?
@SenateGOP @AP looks like we are not buying your BS. Do your job while you have it. VOTE BLUE!
@SenateGOP @AP Added provisions to cut ACA and @PPact The bill does nothing to stop Zika #IstandwithPlannedParenthood & I vote
@SenateGOP @AP @SenateDems : back Trump 100% or get to your nursing home
GOP packed bill with restrictions on Planned Parenthood $$s and changes to policies on pesticide spraying.
@SenateGOP @AP @SenateDems ok we got that the dems suck.  Now stop finger pointing and do something.You're wasting opportunity
@SenateDems You can spin it anyway you want Mitch but we know who's telling the truth & it's not you. Resign already.
Because of the ACA and Planned Parenthood bills Republicans attached. Playing games w American lives. Republicans suck.
@SenateDems why not tell us what else is in the bill?? You won't will you...BS!!
Jesus your disgusting, why are you so sexually twisted that a woman's vagina & her right to her body is your 1st thought?
@SenateDems House Zika Bill Would Raid HHS Fund for New Medicare Payment System
: You're a fraud!
@SenateDems When a no-brainer bill fails to pass I always ask what garbage was stuck in it to undermine it. Well Mitch?
@SenateDems #zika didn't cause birth defects, mass pesticide spraying did #bought those pesticides are known 2 do that
@SenateDems considering their position on abortion , why does this surprise you?!
@McConnellPress @AP .& WHAT DID YOU SNEAK INTO IT THAT THE #DEMS HAD TO BLOCK? #GOPSCUM
@SenateDems Zika didn't cause the birth defects in Brazil, the pesticides they sprayed all over the country did #vaxxed
REALLY?! Defunding VA benefits. Deregulating enviro standards, bringing back confederate flag...  Should I continue? #dumbGOP
- Don't forget, @SenateMajLdr is the leader of a terrorist group known as #47traitors - https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/file-charges-against-47-us-senators-violation-logan-act-attempting-undermine-nuclear-agreement …
@SenateDems Why are they blocking it? Are you, Republicans, adding amendments to it? Details would help
HALF THE MONEY SIX MONTHS LATE LARDED UP WITH CRAP AND *YOU* ARE POINTING FINGERS?
