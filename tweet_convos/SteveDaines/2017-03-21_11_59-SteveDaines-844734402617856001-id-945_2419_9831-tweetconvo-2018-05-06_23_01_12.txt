No farmers, no food!!
No Mexicans, no one to plant and pick. Every one must Google data about food in US from, by who.
false
believe what you want,  I am only suggesting you research, where US produce is from (35%) & US fruit (65%)
More from CA, who tends it? CA is largest dairy state too, check data. All Mexican workers.
that's on CA for allowing it
I wish my father were still alive to see this day.  He was a farmer and like most was never respected .God Bless You! 
What kind of farmer was your father?
Hello! We had a Grade A dairy (holsteins), almonds, alfalfa & corn.  And you?
We are a small hill country dairy farm also selling grassfed beef. We should start selling honey, too. Nice to hear about your farm 
We need to label GMO foods,get rid of farm subsidies, address lack of water issues.
why is it an important fact that GMOs should be labeled ?
Because I want to know what im eating
Because I believe gmos aggravate my ezcema.
Right thing to do
same here, thank you for your input!
Gut issues
GMO has taken over corn and soy,these are in almost everything
Trying to not take meds
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO PURCHASE LOCALLY GROWN  PRODUCE
George Conway Found to Have Russian Bribe Ties, Trump Appoints Him to DOJ Anyway

You just deregulated so companies make more because they can use insecticides proven to cause child Impairments.
Need our ag  man confirmed. Farmers need his help.

Psalm 33:12
Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord, The people He has chosen as His own inheritance.
so what is @FLOTUS wearing to your church? A miniskirt?  How inappropriate.  There is nothing godly abt 45 or family.
the bible says, the way we judge others, were judged 3 fold. Means 3×3×3.

@agday @POTUS @WhiteHouse can we stop with the massive subsidies?
Impeach Trump, the Vice, Speaker of the House, Head of State.. cuz their all bad. Hold new election.. based on popularity.
Impeach the asshole representing the United States, overturn all of his signature bills.. place him in jail, freeze assets.
Wow! how cool is that? Farmers here starving and we pull their subsidies. We Grow NOTHING here! WTF is wrong with your mind?
So are going to order that Black farmers are given the advantages as white farmers?
Is that before or after you defund the USDA? #NotMyPresident
please look whats happening to the Bundys and Hammonds in NV Judge breaking Constitutional law against American Ranchers
They're the very heart of our economy! Thanks to Everyone who works so hard in our wonderful Agriculture Economy!
Finally a tribute to the Farmers
Stop killing pets and endangering Americans with your cyanide bombs!   @USDA @POTUS @WhiteHouse
I guess you are too busy RTing @POTUS press releases to listen to your constituents about the age tax in #AHCA #mtpol @USDA
get rid of GMO foods
Oh irony, thy name is Trump. "Here, you have your own day. Now gimme back $4.7 billion." https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/trump-seeks-47-billion-in-cuts-to-usda-discretionary-spending/2017/03/15/c8fd5622-09ab-11e7-b77c-0047d15a24e0_story.html?utm_term=.5258a6816ab7 …

hood choice 2nd day of spring  we honor another department that we're eliminating. u can't expect mom's to $ 4 vegs
there is enough shit at 1600 Penn to run all farms in the east coast this spring
.@USDA @PimpingPolitics @POTUS Farmers feed #America. I am astonished there was never a #NationalAgDay before now. Another FIRST for @POTUS!
We need local, small farms & ranches back to avoid issues w/bird flu & similar
On NO? What is TRUMP planning to give USDA what they want AMERICA doesn't want? He's up to something so watch out!
So he can spread more fertilizer on the people. @POTUS giving citizens the 'mushroom' treatment!
I wanna declare tomorrow #NationalImpeachTrumpDay
#ImpeachTrump
#TrumpIsMyLeftNut
Pls veto the bill allowing cruel killing of animals in Alaska. Most voters there oppose the bill and you should if you are kind
You wouldn't know agriculture even if you had a corn cob up your ass. TRY IT!
big FARMa has an habit of pushing corn and sugar. DofA would do well to work with Surgeon General to improve health
no farmers no food back off
After you get done gutting all the regulations that keep our food, air and water safe what is there going to be to celebrate?
is this a salute to Nunes?
You mean "Screw The Family Farmer In Favor Of Corporate Ag" Day.
OMG - This, THIS is so funny! Climate change and general science deniers celebrate something they know nothing of. OPTICS
@PressSec @POTUS
@PressSec @POTUS @WhiteHouse My, how ironic. Giving them a National Day of recognition while systematically guttingthem.  Hmmmm
@PressSec has lost all credibility....nothing more than a punch line to a joke.
Yeah, as you slash the USDA budget.
All "proclamations" by the #KGBPresident are void and dead on arrival...we accept nothing from #PutinsBitchBuddy
@PressSec @POTUS  he better  rethink about global warming otherwise there wont be nothing to grow in a drought #makingupholidaysagain
that's strange coming from you when you are cutting FDA science!
I wish there was a bill on Donald's desk that would allow the service men & women to carry on base
has that happened
45 knows all about agriculture, because he knows that shit makes LIES grow and grow and grow#whiteliesmatter
STOP PESTICIDES, NO GMOs, SAVE OUR FARMERS AND FOOD!!!
Excellent! Then he'll price remaining family farmers out of their health insurance. He cares only for corporate farms.
In honor of Ag Day could you send me a load of horseshit? Your admin seems full of it. Could use some organic matter and NPK
#45 lived high luxury all his life, rarely out of the Golden Bubble, what can he do or say about agriculture? He knows nothing.
What does this mean? Less support 4 BigFarma? More 4 small farms? Less pesticides in food? Less agri waste to poison water?
I am looking forward to the day we conquer Russia and take back our White House.
@PressSec @POTUS @WhiteHouse when is national clean air day? National Parks & clean lakes day? Clean rivers clean Bay days?
@PressSec @POTUS @WhiteHouse how will u feel if u r successful advancing the fascist agenda. TRAITOR!!
@PressSec @POTUS @WhiteHouse it's a shame that you haven't allocated any funds to the u.s. agriculture community no Farms mean no food
in celebration we will dump more coal waste into fresh water and make sure no farmer has health insurance!  Win!!!
@PressSec @POTUS @WhiteHouse 
That explains the bullshit.
also known as suck up and lie day #theResistance
@PressSec @POTUS @WhiteHouse Y'all are doing great things♡♡♡♡




How about a National Treason Day when #notmypresident   can be tried as one? Whoo whoo - what a party this country would have!
What good is this going to do. The benefits? will they get a paid day off,Just asking
The @POTUS Budget cuts NOAA, the Weather Service, because farmers don't need timely weather forcasts. @POTUS is at a Media Event.
@SteveDaines @POTUS @WhiteHouse I thought The People decide that...,so vote wisely, please..
@SteveDaines @POTUS @WhiteHouse Love how Trump threatens Senators they'll lose their seat if the fail to vote Trumpcare...Funny,..1/2
@PressSec @POTUS @WhiteHouse No EPA = NO BEES. NO BEES = NO CROPS. NO CROPS = NO FARMERS
Why did the Potus do anything for Agriculture? I mean he cut the Agriculture budget? Did anyone forget?
How very pretentious of him. As usual. The men and women who provide our food should be honored EVERY day.
I don't mean to get off track. I am so excited about the wiretapping that Obama's busted finally! Let's DANCE
@PressSec @POTUS Great idea!
@PressSec @POTUS @WhiteHouse Who cares as we won't be able to buy food under your new Trumpcare premiums.

Unfortunately, that IS in #TRUMP proposed budget cut plan #TRUTH
yet U ignored the disastrous wildfires in 4 states that killed 7, destroyed homes, businesses & livestock. SICK!
@PressSec @POTUS Tell me why the President is proposing a 20% cut in the Dept.of Agriculture's budget. Lousy, Sad & Terrible!
How appropriate considering you're covering everything in fertilizer! (shit!)
@PressSec @POTUS How about national manure day? Since you and POTUS are so full of bulls***?
@PressSec @POTUS President Trump needs to deactivate his Twitter account. He does more harm than good, looking at the big picture .
Perfect day! Thank you Sir!!

you don't seem concerned with farmers, look at the cancellation of trade agreement, and proposed healthcare bill.
@DCRobMan @USDA @POTUS No matter how many times you keep lying about Russia & Trump.  It will never be true, ever
@DCRobMan Keep repeating lies.  It will still not be changed truth to get your impeachment.  You will fail again.

let's applaud producers of grains, fruits, and vegetables. Not the mass slaughter of non-human animals. It's 2017.
#NationalAgDay learn about #aggag /Ag-gag, factory farming. Give up the animal eating addiction & pledge better health for yourself.
