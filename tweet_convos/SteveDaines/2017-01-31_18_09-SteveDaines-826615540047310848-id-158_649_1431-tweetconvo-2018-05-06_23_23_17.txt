no but Freire and brimstone shoots out of his ass
GOP is irrelevant and was not by the people
@SteveDaines @BenSasse No on Gorsuch #NoJusticeNoBills #NoWallNoBan #SeparationofChurchandState
And that is something you have great experience with, yes?
There is no evidence provided by Neil Gorsuch that he respects the rights of the unborn.
LGBTQ Americans see you, @SenatorLankford.
Yes please give him the same fair hearing that Judge Garland received. Wait, Repubs obstructed that hearing...
Please don't be hypocrites God is watching
Merrick Garland was an honorable man and you spit on him
Neil Gorsuch isn't the problem. The problem is Merrick Garland wasn't even considered.
Poorly put. You should have askd Dems to give him a chance, give him a hearing. Nope couldn't resist taking jabs
@secupp @BenSasse the seat was stolen.  It can't be allowed.  He will be filibustered so deal with it.
. And he takes acting/ crying lessons. Just like Reagan learned how to act with Chimps. CREDENTIALS
ya. i think the dems should just respectfully treat gorsuch the same way ya'll treated garland.
another idiot that needs to read about no justice being heard or going through process last year of presidency not even bushs
um ok?
actually not... there hasn't been one accepted in last year of last term for 90yrs look it up
Anthony Kennedy was accepted to the SCOTUS on Feb. 18, 1988. FINAL YEAR of Reagan Presidency.  Class dismissed
nope 90 years of this not happening, joe Biden even said this so is he wrong too?
Actually he is...read a history book or google it...
Stooping to the lead bully's example. Bunch of lil boys with their jokes & name-calling. Unfortunate.
#Hmm, #Taxpayers subsidize your govt. healthcare plan. What a waste of taxpayer money. #DefundViagra #SaveACA
Take your q from Pelosi and just "tell them you're a Muslim". You'll sail through with flying colors.
why don't I believe you, now your sounding like President Trump

After the way the Republicans refused to even consider Merrick Garland, you have no right to complain.
stop whining. You blocked Garland. Why was that ok ?
Hell man! We don't want no puppy-kicking judges. What are you thinking?! Where's your Oklahoma family values?
He is a good person, and he should be entitled to the same fair hearing that Judge Garland received.
When u control Senate, u can decide who gets a vote. Right now, elections have consequences.  Remember?
Ever since 11/8/16 Dems have taken politics even lower than gutter politics. Endless Asinine Rhetoric.
Just following the pre 11/8 Republican playbook, buddy!
Horridness bad both sides.BUT dems character attacks? A retracted LIE still a lie damage  done.
LOL you know the quote is parody, right? #alternativefacts
@SteveDaines @BenSasse How does he feel about women's rights? Stop trivializing the issue  #womensinspire
@LisaMarieBoothe @BenSasse  Bwaaahaaahaaa...........
Senator Lankford, your immature pettiness in this post is revealing. I'm becoming more embarrassed by the day.
@TheRickWilson @BenSasse it is unfortunate that Garland had a contagious disease b/c so few GOP wouldn't even meet with him
This is what real Senators do..Not corporations PEOPLE.
Not my President Not my Senator both are bought.
You can't answer an email or a phone, let alone a tweet, and your now a Rogue Scholar?? Please we will remember
@TheRickWilson @BenSasse He can have his vote as soon as Merrick Garland has his.
Must have been a really slow night. Or a very slow crowd.
Chuck is crying BCZ the transgender bathroom signs will be removed.Big Bearded Burly Boys can't use girls bathrms
@TheRickWilson @BenSasse Pretty sure there's video of the puppy kicking.
Yes he deserves the treatment GOP bestowed upon Garland, nothing more, nothing less.
I heard it was kittens and grade school plays (:>)
Crank up the dis-information machine dems!
"what's the hurry" is a much more appropriate mantra. Or "let's give Putin a chance to weigh in".
while shedding a fake tear
he might be a meat eater.
no he's just going filibuster as he should. Turn about is fair play
@SteveDaines MT is what 46 out of 50 in state #GDP ?? Lol.  Good job.  Pat yourselves on the back.  In Trump terms =#losers
@SteveDaines - stay in Montana while we on the coastal states create the majority of tax revenue for the country #ripgop
As a Dem, I think this isn't worth fighting. Focus on TRUMP & save SC battle for if RBG replaced w/ conservative.
@TheRickWilson @BenSasse puppy kicker a non-issue, but a whiff of someone who will deny a woman the right to her body, nope
yeah but
@TheRickWilson @BenSasse perhaps he is a good man, but have you been looking at the leaders of the opposition? It's women
He won't need to say it. Jesus himself will be blocked after obstructing Garland. The GOP dug their own grave.
good luck with that
Don't forget the tears

yeah right that's a quote if you're like two years old
YOU need to be smacking old turkey neck 'leader' to make SURE that Gorusch is confirmed!
Neil Gorsuch deserves the exact same Senate consideration that Merrick Garland received.
as my elected official, I'd hope you'd not be petty about this
I guess he will invoke the fake tears again.
About his grandfather losing his mother and seven siblings in the Holocaust? You monsters.
@TheRickWilson @BenSasse Oh please.
awe, so clever and such a sense of humor. You boys are cute, like ur leader president Bannon
vote against DeVos. Please.
@RestoreHistory @BenSasse like Republicans said those things about Garland...
you're mocking is quite becoming, Senator. I hope Gorsuch gets the same measured consideration as Garland.
@LisaMarieBoothe @BenSasse agree Schumer is no leader he's an anarchist
Merrick Garland was a nice guy that @SenateGOP wouldn't give the time of day.  Remember that?
look back in history & see when the last time a SCOTUS was seated during an election year.
Trump just filed for reelection, so I guess we better wait for his pick too then.
umm what? This is his first term. Not second term in an election year.
Probably his last year in office though.
@TheRickWilson @BenSasse too bad GOP's scorched earth tactics w/ Garland destroyed any precedent where that might matter
It is, because this isn't about Gorsuch. This is about what the Senate Republicans did to Garland. Period.
What does he believe about emoluments? Asking for the founders.
@TheRickWilson @BenSasse no actually that is Ted Cruz
now that's the way to handle these crazies! I love clever humor. Way to go. Rs need to take a page from ur book!
@TheRickWilson @BenSasse How about waiting until he actually says something. You'd want the same in return.
#MerrickGarland
Remember how you guys respected Judge Garland, not even giving him a hearing, a vote...so hogwash, Hypocrites!
@TheRickWilson @BenSasse he'll probably say, let's give them the same courtesy we were given with Merrick garland
@kathrynlopez @BenSasse  schumer is ready to jump off a cliff. Trump owns him
@TheRickWilson @BenSasse Corporations aren't people! Are puppies people? No problem, after Garland...you go! 
#Garland
But wait @SenSchumer will cry again maybe he'll do a duet with nancy the Nazi pelousi @NancyPelosi
Who does  @BenSasse think Schumer is?  Mitch McConnell?
I fell asleep while reading your name.
Nancy Pelosi has already said he hates kids with autism.
@TheRickWilson @BenSasse what's good for the goose is good for the gander
So he kicks pianos and heckles puppies? For shame!
What isn't hogwash is that this is a stolen seat. Something that has never happened in the history of our nation
But I bet you guys are proud of that. But there is one that judges righteously. You mocked Garland a man who has
served our nation faithfully. You think it was a political victory, But Mr.Garland is a person shame on you all
@TheRickWilson @BenSasse Ahem, but see #McConnellRule.
Nah, that's more McConnell's style.
@kathrynlopez @BenSasse Wait . . . what's wrong with heckling piano recitals?
@LisaMarieBoothe @BenSasse ... "kicks puppies" LOL ... that's absolutely hilarious! I already like @SenatorLankford & I don't even know him!
@LisaMarieBoothe @BenSasse is Schumer going to cry again? No participation trophey for grandstanding. #DoYourJob #vote
No surprise there from cry baby, we really need to know who is his "coach"..!!!!
@LisaMarieBoothe @BenSasse WHY doesn't the left accept Hillary was never going to win? Loss happens.
@secupp @BenSasse it's not Trumps  turn to pick. Still Obamas turn. Since you republicans skipped his pick.
you're right, having him on the court would be way worse than both of those things
will you ask Judge Gorsuch's opinion regarding your treatment of Judge Garland?

@secupp @BenSasse he voted for him in 2006 which wil make Schumer look like a bigger hack then he already does
Anyone wanna bet @SenSchumer will cry over this one?
Will someone get Schumer some Play Dough & a safe space already?!
this okie says tit for tat! #Garlandgotscrewed
Any chance that's an over-exaggeration? Isn't this how it works on both sides? No sense in getting out of breath.
You clowns are going to hate 2018!
Liberals still staying in that bubble. Excellent. A fool is somebody who just won't learn.
Rev Lankford lying's a sin isn't it? But then again U evangelicals sold your souls to the devil backing Trump.
knows that you don't heckle piano recitals. You live-tweet them.
@secupp @BenSasse I'd like to see evidence he doesn't heckle piano recitals.
@secupp @BenSasse but he learned all that bad behavior after I voted for him in 2006
@secupp @BenSasse you made the bed now lie in it.
your constituents are watching you! You are an inconsistent hack! Don't help Trump, voters remember! #truth  #trumppuppet
look at all the snow flakes hating and being cry babies because they don't get the rule on judges in presidents last term
About to tell the public from where Schumers hair plugs originated.
but he does equate corporations with people
@secupp @BenSasse he better rethink that then  https://twitter.com/seanmdav/status/826610119571935236 …
@secupp @BenSasse #trumpworstpresidentever
Hey! Republican guys! No one uses the 
term "hogwash" anymore! Might as well say "darn",or "fiddlesticks"!
@secupp @BenSasse Nope. Just payback for Merrick Garland
@secupp What he SHOULD say is: the GOP obstructed Obama in unprecedented fashion & we’re responding in kind.
.@SenatorLankford @secupp  Where's your spine gone @BenSasse? I'm so old I remember when you used to oppose Trump. #FilibusterGorsuch
the founders left out a lot of folks. hope he doesnt think it was a great idea to do that
@secupp @BenSasse Something here is hogwash.
Merrick Garland
You are missing the point.  The point is:  Merrick Garland.
YOU are a hypocrite YOU don't represent US
@ttocnavt40 @BenSasse yup, seems to be a qualified candidate for the Garland seat
Ha, I know. I just thought it was funny.
I'm just bitter and angry about rewarding that behavior
I hope it's worth the Trump presidency
Nope, than honor goes to "Neil Gorsuch should get the same fair hearing Merritt Garland did."
he only heckles FLUTE recitals !
You shame Oklahoma!
seriously do you think this is the sort of shit your constituents want to see you post?  Grow up!
Oh man, not the @BenSasse piano recital again? Did your wife finally forgive you Senator?
So long as he live-heckles the recitals on Twitter for all our enjoyment.
@SteveDaines @BenSasse I heard that he beat his hamster once!!!
this is fascinating to mei remember when @SenatorLankford was speaking at Falls Creek (church camp) in high school and here....
he is quoting you... weird and weirdly cool
@NancyPelosi beat him to it on CNN town hall. Her rush to get it out resulted in "thks 4 having me; he's awful"
No, it's your Pres. who berates people and disrespects them. Stop the hypocrisy.Garland much?
do u even know what has been a historical ruleNo judge been approved or vetted at end of presidency
; Um, he said SCOTUS justice must stand up to a Pres willing to bend the Constitution. Not the same, fear monger.
we acted like idiots over the last 11 months. I guess it's their turn now.
actually he kicks babies & thinks it ok for ppl to shoot up kids in schools. Also let oil cos to pollute wherever
does actually heckle piano recitals. It's documented on his twitter hahahaha
You're a good guy, Senator, but your party is going to wear Garland for a long time.
not really, would you have been ok if bush would have bee able to pick a nominee at the end of his term
. Keep it up Mr Lankford.Your constitutants are watching.Waiting to hear from you soon on those questions i posed
I second that. I am waiting to see some backbone against Trump
All Schumer has to say is: "Why does this guy get a fair hearing when Garland didn't?  Not asking rhetorically."
because history has been no judge getting approved or vetted in last year of presidency
Really?  You consider that snarky comment the quote of the night?  Lordy, we are all in trouble.
does a woman have the right to play God with a baby?
I don't follow. Let's use the medical definition for baby & for life. Otherwise we're peeing up a rope.
we need Sessions confirmed this week!!!!!
Quite the opposite. I hear he heckles puppies and kicks piano recitals.
it's more like he doesn't know the meaning of church separate from state. I hope you wake up brown and Muslim tomorrow.
Best!
get out of the locker room and get to work you too.
