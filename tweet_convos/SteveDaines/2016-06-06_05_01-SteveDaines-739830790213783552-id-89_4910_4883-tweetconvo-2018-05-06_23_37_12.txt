“@DeptofDefense: 72 years ago, 160,000 Allies landed at #Normandy  on #DDay. The sacrifice of 9,000 gave Allies a foothold in Europe.

@TijuasPerros Don't forget about black people, they helped too.

@OneAtticus My grandfather was part of it.  Carried a bullet in his back the rest of his life. #DDay #GreatestGeneration
