where is that idiot McConnel and the lightweight Ryan who promised to repeal Obamacare!
you all should mention all the providers that left Obamacare. Like mine. Millions are looking for new healthcare after jan 1
Socialized healthcare at its best, um worst, um....
Why does congress stand by and do nothing!! We need revolution
as predicted

Great and we have companies leaving Ky to move to Mexico all we need is higher insurance and hospital and doctors
all in low income states too....surprise surprise!
horrible. Of course those of us who didn't vote for Obama knew this would happen. Super predictable!
truth. Government run anything is a nightmare. No checks & balances like the rest of us have.
exactly what Obama wanted.  Socialized medicine coming soon.
Shame on #GOP #Repeal

You sabotaged #Obamacare for your selfish and ideological reasons while 'we the people' suffer. 8yrs and not a clue!
no Obama said premiums would drop
@HillaryClinton @foxnewslatino @cnnbrk @MSNBC @ABC @CBSNews @NBCNews @LatinoVoices /In favor of Obamacare(spit now)vote HilLIARy!
Good job, Obama!
Obamacare is expensive! What did he do to this country besides dividing it!
Just look at TN where I live. Obamacare is a disaster This helps no one. Makes me sick! Needs repealed immediately!!
the numbers of people signed up is padded. They have signed my sister on at least 5 times through JFS.
yet more states where "Affordable" Care Act is costing more. It's opposite land: affordable = costly, illegal = legal
Mine is from 400 to 850. Sure enrollment is up, but it's all the people that are not paying for it.
-anothergrandiose BeelzebamalegacyFAIL! His legacyscoreisjust like Bluto Blutarsky's GPA:http://zero.zero !8yrs downthedrain!
plan to go single payer/total govt run is about to happen.
thank you ObamaCare
@LindaSuhler hell the Repubs have been preaching this since the clowns passed it.  SMH
OUCH!
why do they call it Obama care when everyone knows that the Republicans made it impossible to afford
that's why we need single payer. US is only developed country without socialized healthcare... and healthcare for profit.
Why all southern states?  Aren't damocrap states going up and if not, why?
If Obama likes this plan so much, he can keep it! I'm done with Obamacare.
Americans donot yet understand what Obamacare has done to us.B4 Obcare MC Americans had HMOs w/100% Hsptl Now 80% w/$10K deductbls
No kidding. This is terrible. People better wake up on this government.
thank democrats for screwing the middle class again #NeverHillary
I hope obama care is mentioned by chris wallace in the debate.
Rates way Up not down.HMO's gone now deductbls are $7K-$10K per family.Obamacare is a disaster for the Middle Class!!!
'We had to LIE to the American voters to pass ACA.' Jonathan Gruber
ObamaCare premium spikes. 
SEND 2 MR TRUMP IMM & RT PLEASE: MR TRUMP, SHARE HOW YOU'RE GOING 2 FIX THIS PROBLEM! DO IMM PLEASE & WE VOTE 4 YOU! -We The People
@LindaSuhler Pilot to Copilot we're going down in flames!
wish my salary was going up as fast as my insurance rates.  #insurancepoor
In the poorest states where few can afford these huge hikes ....
@DariaSalusbury
Americans biggest scam next to the clintons boy we got fucked thanks mr. President not even the common courtesy of a reach around
collapse the system is the plan / one payer system signed in by presidential signature / welcome to the VA
Thanks Obama. You'll be gone next year when they really go up. Thanks for destroying the best system on the planet.
wow is anyone surprised? Maybe the fools that believed the liar obama
You know @HillaryClinton wants to expand on this HUGE mistake
#NeverHillary
According to Supreme Court Obama Care is a TAX. Therefore taxes rise on those who can not afford it.Obama is laughing at you.
Come on, people.  Wake up!
Ours went up and have announced that soon they'll no longer even provide us with the current rate!
: Good job #GOP

You've always wanted to sabotage #Obamacare for your selfish and ideological reasons while 'we the people' suffer.
I wonder why our poorer, red states are mostly affected? What are they doing wrong?
They spike, bcz ppl get more coverage then before O'Care
wow!!!!  What a shock!!!  It was such a fantastic plan!!!!!  IDIOTS!!
out of context and total lie
Who in their right mind would want Obamacare. It has been a disaster. Voting 4Trump to repeal it & provide better&less costly care
that's affordable because most people get annual raises questions n the 60-70% rates
trump-o-care will go into affect hrs after he takes office of President. 2016
TN/MS/KY must be the States that received the Obamacare "upgrade" described by WH Press Sec Earnest.
ALL REPUBLICAN CONTROLLED STATES should come at no surprised.
Big insurers stiffing the little guy again!
Maybe he should rent  the Lincoln bedroom like Clintons did & use the cash to pay for Obama care. Naw, just scrap the whole mess.
@julieroginsky @jaketapper @JessicaTarlov @MSNBC @MelissaAFrancis @HowardKurtz WHO IS THIS DISASTER WORKING TO HELP?
@RedState
Obama ....."and you can keep yo yes yo doctor ! #HillaryisObama in a different gender and skin. #Fox #BET #CNNisthenewBET.
When you see insurance premium increases of this magnitude, it is the beginning of the end for Obamacare.  RIP!

Confederate states aka your core audience.

Kill that mandate. 
The fake doctors are bullshit.
