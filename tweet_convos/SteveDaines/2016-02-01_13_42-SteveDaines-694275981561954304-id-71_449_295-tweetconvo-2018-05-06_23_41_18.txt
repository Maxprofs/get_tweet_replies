@markknoller A fair reporting would show how the yearly deficit has dropped like a rock under Obama. https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=3jBi …
You can thank the GOP congress for those declining deficits @nathan2s1
@acebb20 The largest declines were -- wait for it -- when the democrats controlled both the house and senate (2009 and 2010).
@nathan2s1 Run deficit to all time high.
Deficit declines from all time high
Yeah, Democrats! 
LMFAO. You people are beyond parody.
@acebb20 Again: The all-time highest budget deficit was under Bush ($1.4 trillion) -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_United_States_federal_budget …
@nathan2s1 The Democrats controlled congress. You understand who controls government spending right?
@acebb20 The Republicans held 49 Senate seats in 07-08 and dictated the terms of things. Threatened "blue dog Democrats" often.
@nathan2s1 "Dictated the terms of things" 
Hilarious. Remember, it isn't a lie if you believe it.
@markknoller 10.2 Under Bush
@MSRI1972 @markknoller I'm Right, Your Wrong...
@ChadPoker @MSRI1972 @markknoller You posting an article from January 2015 does not make you "right"
Can you read?
@acebb20 @MSRI1972 @markknoller Remember Bush had a Surplus when he came into office, so his number is actually a little higher...
@MSRI1972 @ChadPoker Bush added 10 trillion!!
https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo5.htm …
Or not.
@markknoller so about 2 trillion less than GWBUSH...
@ChadPoker @markknoller false
@DoctorDerb @markknoller I'm Right, Your Wrong...
@ChadPoker @markknoller the debt increased $4.9 trillion under Bush so you're* wrong
@markknoller @jjklee simple. Pay more taxes! Have to one day
@markknoller @JonahNRO  PARTY
@markknoller @GerryCallahan means it was 11 trillion by the time the republican who inherited a surplus was done. Yes, let's do that again
@markknoller @Bwdreyer but but but... "That's UnAmerican! Unpatriotic!"
@markknoller @SteveDaines maybe its time to start taxing the corporations...
@markknoller @DLoesch
All you bleeding heart liberals that voted for obama need to foot this debt. My pockets are empty! #PJNET
@crdixon1975 BRILLIANT! Maybe you can pay for Bush's wars then?  @markknoller @DLoesch
@TheBrowning @markknoller @DLoesch seems to me you and I both are paying for it
@markknoller An oldie but a DNC goodie… “It’s George W. Bush’s fault”.
@DL1651 @markknoller Their go to. And I recall a certain someone calling $9T "unpatriotic" & promising to fix it
@vaughanpitts @markknoller 

Now you know you’re not supposed to remember THAT.
@markknoller Has anyone bothered to tell him?@EntheosShines
@markknoller @DLoesch kkkkk
@markknoller @Dew_West 190 trillion that is the interest payments they tell you.
@princeofpast @markknoller Good thing we can print money?
@Dew_West @markknoller Inflation is coming with realization
@markknoller @JonahNRO percent change in debt much higher under Reagan, then Bush II.
@knowncitizen @markknoller @JonahNRO doesn't help the problem, Jason. 19 Trillion
@JonathanMoon2 @markknoller @JonahNRO true. What have the candidates said they would do? Cutting taxes won't help
@markknoller @GregS7 and between 00-08 the nat.debt rose over $5 trillion under Bush. Difference is the increase cost between 00-08 & 08-16
@markknoller @Stalingrad_Poor See... he promised CHANGE and he delivered. Not enough change in debt if you ask me. Need moar stimulus
@markknoller @Tracinski And yet...he never gets a question about that. Strange.
@markknoller Is Obama @POTUS now going to call himself “unpatriotic” for adding trillions to the national debt?!? @AP @AC360 @Acosta @MSNBC
@markknoller : https://www.gofundme.com/q3kthay4 
@markknoller He promised to cut the debt in half.
@markknoller @DLoesch. You get what you vote for. 1st nanny president
@markknoller So the illuminati are right on schedule to crash the US economy and create the New World Order insectoid paradise.
@markknoller #when interest rates rise we are all screwed!
@markknoller @DividendMaster That is over a TRILLION a year and he has a Trillion to go..
@markknoller @JonahNRO I believe my math tells me he doubled it while in office. Don't blame it on the recession.
@fleetadmiralj @markknoller The debt increases at twice the size official budgetary deficit now.
@markknoller @drewcarter49 And not a single GOP candidate mentioned #debt last night, because ALL of their plans continue to increase it.
@markknoller never let it be said that reparations have not been paid.
@markknoller Did Obama acknowledge that it has doubled under his watch?
@markknoller @EntheosShines  He's such a narcissist he thinks it's his money!
@markknoller @drmrox151 CANT,LEAVE OUT ALL THEM SO CALL CONSERVATIVES
@markknoller @margbrennan We would still be in a depression if it had not increased!
@markknoller @GerryCallahan Took 43 Pres. 219 yrs to accumulate the 1st $10.6T. That inept, treacherous DB increased it by OVER 79% in 7 yrs
@markknoller @ttownorso like this...
@markknoller but, but, but,....Bush!
@markknoller 
@markknoller 
That's why I buy gold from Roslyn Capital, from right here in Roslyn, Long Island, NY...the world capital of BULLion, yo.
@markknoller How many fucking trillion has Iraq and Afghanistan cost??? Any clue??
@markknoller @whpresscorps Just can't thank him enough
@markknoller @GaltsGirl You noticed that, did you?
@markknoller As a related topic, the US govt's unfunded future liabilities is quoted as$230T.There's not enuf trees in OR2print this much$!
@markknoller @kevincorke And he ain't done yet, not by a long shot...#DrunkenSailor
@markknoller @kevincorke Now wait one minute. He has reduced deficit spending. You must watch Fox.
@markknoller Does this mean the #MSM is going to start (finally) putting this on Obama's shoulders? Or let the DEM's "just Blame Bush"?
@markknoller @GerryCallahan https://josephscott.org/archives/2009/03/presidents-that-have-reduced-the-federal-debt/ … "Every President (and Congress) since 1957 has added to the federal debt"
@markknoller Change you can believe in!!
@markknoller @JonahNRO That's because Bush. Also racist. Possibly shut up as well.
@markknoller @DLoesch Flashback: Obama says adding $4 trillion to debt is unpatriotic.
@markknoller @DLoesch AND OBAMA BELLY ACHED BUSH FOR INCREASING DEBT.  BUSH'S DEBT IS CHUMP CHANGE COMPARED TO OBAMA'S
@markknoller bo more than doubled the existing debt from at start of his first term. The existing debt was the total of ALL our presidents.
@markknoller @DividendMaster stunning!
.@markknoller Good times: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyLmru6no4U …
@markknoller @DLoesch...I wish I could run a deficit like that in my bank account.
@markknoller @DLoesch Yes, but it's a really beautiful watch. Auto adjusts as he jets around saving the planet, one fund-raiser at a time.
He just reports. He doesn't take sides. @glenda_cooper @markknoller @POTUS
@markknoller absolutely!I&my great beauty @margbrennan discussed & agree,Debt will increase w/ time,economy will grow 1.5 to 2.5% till 2025.
@markknoller @DLoesch Thats because it's all Bush's fault
@markknoller Looks like your hero has some explaining to do
@markknoller @Jason4SCSU Irrelevant. National debt is a terrible indicator of economic performance. Anyone with half a brain knows that.
@DannyRoch @markknoller @Jason4SCSU The current lousy economy is a good indicator of economic performance.
@LetItBurnUSA @markknoller @Jason4SCSU After a global crisis your economy is doing just fine. As is ours. Military spending is on the up.
@DannyRoch @markknoller @Jason4SCSU 0.7% 4th quarter GDP is not what I'd call doing fine.
@LetItBurnUSA @markknoller @Jason4SCSU Stop being insular. You're global now. And the U.S is leading the way.
@markknoller Please@remind your followers that National Debt is not the same thing as budget deficit.
@BruceRheins @markknoller
Bruce I believe the majority of us followers know the difference
@crdixon1975 @markknoller Sure; but not all.  And that confusion leads to things like the debt ceiling imbroglios, so why not restate it?
@markknoller @JonahNRO So? Now we have gender-neutral bathrooms, and that is all that matters.
@markknoller @JonahNRO little more than 1trillion per year
@LAWGermany @markknoller @JonahNRO But hey unemployment is "low". gas is "cheap" and people have "jobs"
@markknoller @JonahNRO I'm old enough to remember when an $8 Trillion debt was "Un-American"
@MikeBrennan330 @markknoller @JonahNRO 
Everyone does.......except the #usefulidiot Democrats!
@markknoller Rates are low and will remain low for a long time - will never get paid off - #whocares
@markknoller thanks, @POTUS
