Do not confirm until applications are complete and background checks are done.
Rubber stamp
What exactly are his qualifications?
@transition2017 @RepRyanZinke @Interior Goodluck, you'll need it 
OK no confirmations without ethics checks. You demanded of President Obama nominees, now do your job

No hearings until full background checks and financial disclosures are completed!  Follow the rules!
will he comply with ethics rules, or are ethics just for little people and Democrats?
@transition2017 @RepRyanZinke @Interior   Had the pleasure of working with and for him!
#MAGA !
Maybe, or maybe not, but every nominee needs real vetting as per your previous policy
All nominees need to be vetted by the ethics office before approval
 #ethics
. GO ALONG WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. WE NEED HIM NOTCH.
please w/the Mitch quotes, glad to know he's got a pulse, where's he been? (8 yrs)
@SteveDaines @RepRyanZinke @Interior how will this appt. impact our public lands?
You are starting Trump's nominee confirmations WITHOUT the Office of Government Ethics review?
BAD!  Favors wilderness development, transfer of public lands, climate change denier, voted for Sportsmans Heritage Act.....
What about an ex SEAL makes him qualified?
Have all the background checks been completed?
Zinke is a crook, just like you. Could be why you like him. MT is glad he is gone
Yeah somehow Navy Seals are qualified to do whatever. #mushbrainmitch
what has changed from 2009? Why aren't you following the 8 steps you outlined in the attached letter for cabinet confirmations
All nominees need to be vetted by ethics office before approval. #ethicsmatter
Zinke = unqualified climate denier who lies, cheats & steals. Zinke doesn't care about the NPS just $.
@transition2017 @RepRyanZinke @Interior *Is indecisive for ex: abortion and gun control.https://intelligentdiscontent.com/2014/06/04/12-reasons-montanans-cant-and-wont-elect-ryan-zinke-to-congress/ …

@transition2017 @RepRyanZinke @Interior this year we are seeing old men ripped away from their grandchildren side and force >
Or a whore for the Fossil Fuel industry. But I hope he has more integrity than that.
@transition2017 @RepRyanZinke @Interior  Wish him all the success possible! Make us PROUD!

Chuck Schumer is threatening to use the filibuster rule at every turn, so what are we going to do about it?

Yay, he can continue killing people, only this time via his appointment to #GOP #TeamTrump
Oh yea he knows all about environment an the interior because he was a SEAL?  Stupid statement.
Are you telling him about your 3 day career in the Army Reserves you dickless draft dodging coward?
Yet he's already broken one of his biggest campaign promises he made to Montanans. Real cool guy.
McConnell is an idiot.
The fossil fuel industry pick. He will sell our public lands and kill our endangered species. @SenateMajLdr @RepRyanZinke @Interior
ones again stick it up your ass until ky goes green
.@SenateMajLdr @RepRyanZinke @Interior How does the knowledge transfer? I don't remember the @Interior in the job of killing people
how does he feel about native Americans? Probably something racist?
We all know what it means when Mitch McConnell calls someone a "great leader." #swamp
shoot all! Shoulders @DEAHQ @CivilRights vs @ISBEnews @AFTunion @USDEducation King arrest
shouldn't we wait till the next presidential election to name an Interior Sec? Let the voters decide?
@SteveDaines @RepRyanZinke @Interior well your recommendation instantly makes me doubt it
That's a non sequitur.
maybe he can give u some pointers on what leadership means.
great leaders don't #MAKEAMERICASICKAGAIN
He's a good man of principle and character. Don't try to corrupt him with your nonsensical agendas
Hey Mitch! What are you doing to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns and killing 49 people?
Sure doesn't sound like A-1 qualifications to me
Why weren't u as enthusiastic about sup. Court pick?
does he care if Putin interfered in our elections? you don't
