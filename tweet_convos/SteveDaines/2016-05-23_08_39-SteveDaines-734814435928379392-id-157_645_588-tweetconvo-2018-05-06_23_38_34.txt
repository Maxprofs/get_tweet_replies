Aren't you the same guy that has blocked #VeteransBills ?

This vet ain't buying your crap Ryan.
@Benito35ddDavis @SpeakerRyan AMEN!!!
@RepLukeMesser @sarahcwestwood 

Paul Ryan needs to go Luke.
This just saddens me so and its the courageous Men and Women (our Vets) who pay a high price 4 such ignorance#vasectshameonu
@dcexaminer http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/watch-va-secretary-offers-dead-phoneline-to-vets/article/2576223 …
Didn't realize we had Republican president last 7 years or that his VA secretary is Republican. Thanks for heads up. @beydiana @SpeakerRyan
Give me the same health care you have. I gave my country 7 years of my life plus service in Vietnam Don't I deserve Healthcare
I was told I have to wait 8 months to be treated for diabetes & COPD. And NO. Veterans choice won't work. Useless program
I am one... But that is beside the point.
Get behind #Trump2016 or get out of the tent.
The fractured party is on you #DumpRyan
You are a vet who has died waiting in line?
Stand tall and proud @SpeakerRyan against the lying, liberal con man.
Not died, but could happen, the politicians forget the ones who fought for their country, and some now fight for their lives
Not all politicians.  Trump has never shown concern 4 vets and has no clue how to improve VA. Ryan is real conservative leader
Ryan is the reason the party remains fractured. he either needs to get behind #Trump2016 or get out . He CANNOT have his own agenda
fire that guy, or step down you're self
if Congress would just fully fund VA to build more hospitals and hire more doctors the system is overloaded
negative. as in binding arbitration, the remedy is sometimes punitive to the offenders. all VETS 100% no copay,
so why haven't you all done anything about it?!!!!!!! Ugh! Worthless! Too busy bringing in refugees w/tax $ @PRyan @SConnorTX
@RepLukeMesser @sarahcwestwood  Why do you consistently underfund our agencies??  GOP FAIL
GOP, Democrat... I don't care anymore. The two-party system is a failed experiment. We serve and get cast aside by both.
this is in no way an acceptable treatment of those who serve our country. They deserve so much better!
@traveler002 Gov doesn't do anything well! Waste Fraud Abuse Corrupt Unaccountable & just throw more money at it. You're fired!
Secretary Robert (Bob) McDonald
Cell phone number: (513) 509 8454.
http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/watch-va-secretary-offers-dead-phoneline-to-vets/article/2576223 …. It's a false#
@dwt4444 @dcexaminer mean what you say Mr ryan
@dcexaminer and you watched and gave their money to the very people who tried to kill them.
@dcexaminer if you're so concerned about the veteran take part of the defense budget and fully fund the VA hospital system
Why don't they just outsource the VA medical care to local hospitals, make a special wing for vets and have vet doctors
why do you all of a sudden care about that when u squandered the lives and sacrafices of all vets in Iraq?
And Ryan is a big reason why
@Phibear94 Tweets are cheap do something about it! Please Wisconsin vote this Rino out!
@dcexaminer ciertamente
@dcexaminer McDonald was made to Resign from the Procter and Gamble company. He lost $$$. Now the VA can't find $$$. Mmmm
Robert_McDonald only failed at being relatable on this one.
nothing makes me more angry. How are these clowns allowed to run the VA?!
@SenBobCorker @VFWHQ @ConcernedVets @DAVHQ @AmericanLegion @VVAmerica @wwp @AmVetsCommittee @iava IMPEACH FIRED SOAP SALESMAN

Don't put anyone on blast when you aren't doing anything to help the issue. #PotCallingTheKettleBlack
@ConcernedVets IMPEACH THE SOAP SALESMAN @realDonaldTrump @CLewandowski_ #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
@dcexaminer REPUBLICAN PARTY POLICY TO BLAME.
SHAME ON YOU. You love war, hate the wounded&sick. Fund govt , show respect 4 all
Paul Ryan's never sent out so many tweets, he must be really nervous about losing his election seat to Paul Nehlen @pnehlen
Im guessing he hasnt been to Disneyland in about 20 or so years. Disney records wait times, provides wait times, and Fast Pass?
@dcexaminer Mr Secretary you should treat veterans w/respect&dignity. If not for our armed forces were would this country be?
@ErickaJacobs123 Shame @SpeakerRyan Why has @GOP Congress & Senators not Acted American Vets gave their lives @realDonaldTrump
So this is what we have running the VA???? It just keeps getting worse,,,Come on Trump put these Parisites out of office!!!!!
Neither are they waiting in CONSTANT PAIN! This man should be fired for his lack of compassion. #vetsmom
Plz @SpeakerRyan, stop acting like @GOP gives a shit until it uses constitutional powers to stop lawless Obama Adm.
: Thank you. Veterans deserve more from their country.
All VA hospitals have emergency rooms.  I honestly cannot imaging someone just sitting home dying waiting for the VA.
And still, NOTHING happens, NO ONE held accountable. Groundhog Day on DC
It's time for a new VA secretary !!
@dcexaminer Oh..but, U have the $ to bailout Puerto Rico..which allows Cali & Illinois 2 get in line 4 Ryan-bucks u weasel
and what have you done to fix this disaster?
#FireRobertMcDonald
Fix It.
How does the VA Secretary still have this job? As a retiree, during my service, if I screwed up my job, I'd be removed from it.
if you are going to measure wait times, compare them to the private sector like we do patient satisfaction. Reality will show!
there are more pressing issues in the VA and government than wait times.
Hold this SOB accountable!
Can't believe how fucking stupid this Robert McDonald is.
You're the speaker of the house. Do something about it!!!!!
congress holds the purse strings show you're support with funding not Tweets
@CruzNewsLive @dcexaminer Why does this man have this job still? Seriously?
@dcexaminer
So I ask you, Speaker, when is the VA going to be held accountable??? Crickets????
@dcexaminer Long lines @Disneyland are a sign of success. Long lines @DeptVetAffairs hospitals are a sign of failure.
. @SpeakerRyan @dcexaminer And @Disneyland does measure wait times, has them posted, available in apps, and mitigates when too long.
@Montel_Williams
Mr. Speaker this ignoramus should be fired ! Shame on him comparing our brave Veterans to ppl waiting in line at Disney.FireHim
@dcexaminer someone should inform Paul Ryan that Congress dictates all of the VA policies.This GOP Congress is the problem
VA Secretary woefully misinformed. @Disney parks very much DO track wait times & try to improve guest satisfaction!! #FastPass
Maybe @TSA & @DeptVetAffairs can go halfsies on training from @Disney on wait time management.  Whattaya think, @SpeakerRyan? #fastpass
Where do they find these imbeciles who are running large portions of the government bureaucracy?
- sometimes, most times Repub actions don't match what comes out of your mouths. You guys cut VA Funding over the years
good enough for govt work..Washington is full of mediocrity masquerading as professional
this VA guy is unreal! #smh
Disney ABSOLUTELY measures how long people wait in lines. So should the VA.
Finally something both you & @realDonaldTrump agree!  @Reince VA secretary, #clinton   & this administration don't have a clue!
@JennGriff_WTR and yet you approved moving funds from VA to Syrian and Iraqi immigration. You shameful little beta male.
Wow, I actually agree with you...how about you take a stand to end our wars in the Middle East?
As if these Senators have been sitting in office all this time and now are showing shock? Give me a break.
Thank you Speaker Ryan I pray all Americans read this article. How would Secretary McDonald like to wait for care or1ToWait?
But you won't do anything about  it. You fund without requiring changes.
@Heminator 
Time to fire him
You can censure him today!
.& UR JUST GETTING @ TO THIS NOW? WHAT WERE U WAITING FOR? YOU'VE BEEN IN THE HOUSE LONG ENUFF! NOW THEY'RE DYING CAUSE OF YOU!
@1sonny12 How much in Omnibus did you take away from vets to give refugees or any other American
EVERY DAY RYAN SHOWS WHY HE IS THE PROBLEM NOT THE SOLUTION!

RYAN IS SO SELF OVERATED!

VOTE #TRUMP AMERICA!
I'm pissed about his phony conservative principles  He gave Obama everything he wanted Stuck us w/damages
Just think how much better the VA could become if we gave all the money that energy companies get in subsidies to the VA
I would appropriate 2 weeks salary to everyone that works for the VA & tell them it is their 2 wk notice...
The rest of the money that was originally appropriated would go to fund any healthcare provided that would take care of vets!
Oddly enough the VA Sec is even more out of touch. Disney does an excellent job of measuring wait times against demand.
@dcexaminer
One of the most aggressive racial gerrymanders in the country just lost in the Supreme Court http://thkpr.gs/3780855 
Read to understand the Secretary's comment: "If Disney Ran Your Hospital" http://www.amazon.com/Disney-Ran-Your-Hospital-Differently/dp/0974386014 …
And liberals think that we didn't go far enough with Obamacare, and they want Single Payer. This is our Future World preview.
Why is this IDIOT, McDonald still employed??!!! Grow a set Speaker Ryan and take care of business and fix this!
The callousness with which McDonald made these comments... Why are YOU not calling for his resignation? @SpeakerRyan 
@GOP @realDonaldTrump
And as a point of correction, Mr. Secretary, Disney DOES let you know how long you have to wait to get on a ride. @SpeakerRyan
Right, but he wants to measure the 'satisfaction' with that death experience.  Try to keep up, Mr. Speaker.
Hold his paycheck for as long as it would take a Vet to get an initial appointment. Tell him it's just like Disneyland.
@dcexaminer please fire the Secretary, and hire someone who cares about our Veterans.
I believe the Obama Government should be required to experience a FEW of those LINES at the VA.
@mchalfant16 @dcexaminer Obvious why VA in spite of all the hoopla is still riddled w/ problems. He shd be fired!
Disney World long ago turned the art of crowd control and measuring wait times into a science.  REMOVE HIM @VA APPOINT MONTEL!!
@dcexaminer Get rid of that soap salesman our Veteran's are dying waiting for care they don't get! We are 30 year vetUSArmy.
@DeptVetAffairs @VeteransHealth @VAChair Disney has an app for that.Wait times are public so u can choose where 2 go. If only..
@PeteHegseth @dcexaminer Disneyland doesn't over-prescribe opiates.Let Vets go to a real hospital! #VAScandal #FixTheVA #22ADay
you have to be reevaluated every 3 months to get an opiate. Aspirin the best drug for pain
@SteveDaines Paul Ryan is a corporatist who only cares about veterans every other November.
@dcexaminer Disney has a wait time smartphone app to track in real time, btw! Sad that veteran healthcare doesn't get same.
@Montel_Williams  Hey Montel--this may be an unintended result of the #lgbt efforts--vets R targets for Obama administration
. @SpeakerRyan But do you have the BALLS to impeach him? He doesn't seem up to the task at hand and needs to be replaced.
.@DeptVetAffairs Sec McDonald shd be FIRED @SpeakerRyan This was soulless, evil remark. He doesn't care about doing his job caring for Vets
@dcexaminer the sad thing is that Disney DOES measure wait times.
@SpeakerRyan
0 value added, not engaged, FAILED VETS. You are Speaker 100+ staffers sit around 9-5 while vets suffer
@trumpy17 @SpeakerRyan You TRAITORS have
DISHONORED AMERICA'S VETERANS/SOLDIERS & U HAVE BETRAYED WE THE PEOPLE #USA4TRUMP
Funny thing, Disney measures wait times all day, everyday.
that is your Government in action. We want change. #Trump2016 #MAGA
What a dunce.  He's so stupid he doesn't know that Disney DOES measure ride wait times.
@TRex21 I would much rather he pick up the phone and call and not tweet. But, everything these days is politics...
what a fool - so all Vets are on their ride within an hour?  No that wld be the clck starting when calling, not seeing a doc
@ConcernedVets @dcexaminer - McDonald is another Obama lackey.  All those appt'd to positions for vets, should be Vets.
we'd like to see Congress off its own cush healthcare plan and on ObombaCare like "the rest of us"
Rarely do I agree with you, but today I'll make an exception. Now, please fix it so they have same benefits as u. Thanks!
@dcexaminer Whole lotta vets out there wishing they could take their kids to Disney, but they can't...cause they're dying.
agreed, Sir. People may be 'dying' to get on a ride....but they are not dying while in a line.
#VeteransFirst Congress, POTUS, USG employees give up yr healthcare, get in those lines. Put your health where Vets put theirs.
Good grief!  More proof they live in fantasy land.
<<== has been systematically underfunding #VA because he wants to privatize it! #LyinRyan has $$ for war but nothing for #Vets
Goodbye, Robert McDonald!  End this now.
Even when an ER patient is Hospitalized as 'Emergency potential Strokes/heart failure' VA DR. appointments 60-90 days later.
They have and you have done nothing to help. #DumpRyan
@dcexaminer are you a veteran?
@rogiloc @SpeakerRyan that is sad our veterans deserve much better shame on you @SpeakerRyan
Then you shoulda funded the system better!
@dcexaminer You are right Mr. Speaker and his remarks are indicative of a callous attitude towards Vets. He should be replaced.
is he serious? We're not waiting for a ride on the flying elephants at the VA. HEALTHCARE is NOT entertainment.
apparently the secretary isn't a veteran or anyone in his family. Interesting in this admin that people die waiting for help.
unbelievably insensitive comment by the VA Sec, my fellow veterans do not deserve this!  Thanks for your support Speaker Ryan!
this VA secretary thinks serving veterans is no more than Disney entertains visitors. He should not be here.
I'm a disabled veteran, if Disney land had as many people dying as the VA they would have shut that mother down!
And your budget deal took money away from Veterans and gave it to Iraqi and Syrian immigrants. Thanks for looking out
Paul the time has come to Unite with Trump. Americans from all over have United. Join the movement.
SO HOW MUCH DID YOU GUYS APPROPRIATE TO VA, AGAIN?
Give veterans the same gold card giving to Congress. That voted themselves out of Obamacare
Ironic. Congress tells the American people Obamacare is bad for us, adopts original ACA bill for themselves.
but but single payer! It works so well in Europe!
