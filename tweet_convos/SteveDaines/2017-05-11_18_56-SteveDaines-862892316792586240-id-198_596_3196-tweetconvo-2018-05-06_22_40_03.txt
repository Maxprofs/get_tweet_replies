Fighting for rights nobody wants to take way. You're a marketing group. And a waste of time.
Carpetbaggers who think Montanans one issue voters w a New Jersey guy running in Montana and a guy who shoots prairie dogs named Trump jr
The Trump brats big game hunters. That don't them men it makes them wimps
@RobQuist is NOT going to take away our firearms! @GregForMontana is a greedy fake who supports only billionaires. @SteveDaines is a coward.

Yo Junior, have you actually read the Constitution? Your daddy obviously hasn't.
God bless you all always.  America stands firmly behind Pres. Trump & the entire Trump family.
Does any of this bother you nits? https://twitter.com/funder/status/863406976134504449 … Trump has no Russian ties??

Some Americans must be mentally ill just to carry an assault weapon, oh look at you big are you making for the loss in the groin area
Second amendment old very old involves militia people with pitch forks and oh yes assault weapons. Give a gun to an idiot and what happens

Dusgusting
Can I bring my gun to your rally?
Great day w/lobbyists proving that #Potus is DEF for Sale. Buying the freedom for Lobbyists & Corp to spit on USAs Amendment Rights #Shame
speaking of freedom, you do realize that Montana is a big moocher state, don't you?
SolutionReady is a cloud based medical billing service. That GREG IS CEO OF, you go greg... Get u some$$$
Fighting for freedom from what?  Healthcare? Public Access?  Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out  and forget how you got here.
Look into getting a chin implant and have the country pay for it. At least then, you'd look better while you're robbing the country blind.
How about coming to ca. to fight for gun rights. We have been stripped of all gun right protections and purchase. Travesty.
Why? So you #trumpMonstets can kill wild animals. You're the animals in that scenario. Can't hunt in prison, but you will be hunted.
who'd you fight? some deer?
honored to meet you both and to support Greg! Thanks for coming to MT!
pure idiots!
Thank you, guys!
How bout them prairie dogs JR?   Yummmm yummmm, do you skewer them or throw them into some of your backyard city hillbilly stew?

So you're saying that Americans have to fight for their freedom in Montana? Please explain?
@SteveDaines @DonaldJTrumpJr @GregForMontana @charliekirk11 
Great
Because the big bad liberals are plotting take away your guns so @realDonaldTrump can have full control with no fear of resistance.
Wish you were coming to Bozeman!
The four stooges.

On the FBI site right now, powerful words on why American officials don't swear loyalty to a man, but to the Constitution: 

So this is where the Devotees of the Religion of Liberalism come to offer their sacrifice of insults to prove their lunacy and devotion hmm
@NRA @DonaldJTrumpJr @GregForMontana @charliekirk11 #fearforprofit #gunsaregoodbutfeariswrong #riseupis2ndamendment
Treasonous Trump family members/Putin puppets fighting for our rights. Yeah... I totally believe that.
hope you paid for the trip and you  paid out of pocket for secret service to protect your spoiled a$$
Please help me save my daughter https://www.gofundme.com/3no5a8g 
Please help me save my sweet Kaity
Don't we already have 2nd Amendment rights?
literally no one is trying to take your guns away from you, you don't need to fight for anything
Us dems do not wanna take your guns!! We want sensible gun laws so people who shouldn't have guns don't. #backgroundchecks daddy is #SCROTUS
Look everyone four perfect turds all in row!  
We Montanans are not stupid. We know "freedom" is not what ur here fighting for.

For each one strongly approving of trump there are two strongly disapproving. 
KillislamEverythingComesback
I don't get it: Pro voter registration anti gun registration. You want to protect a democracy using the tools that sustain tyranny? 

Trump Jr complains about rich politicians in DC at Gianforte rally in Butte #mtpol


Another Clown Show. Nobody cares. Tick Tock...

Comrade Putin thanks you for your service. Now, go kill some prairie dogs! Or giraffes-we're not picky. #MontanansareNOTstupid
Fighting for freedom and 2nd amendment rights? What about the freedom of the innocent killed by assault weapons?
Thank goodness your dad rolled back that law denying mentally ill people a firearm!NOW everyone IN photo CAN have a gun!How about DT taxes?!
GUN LOVING CREEPY CREEPS.
4 white men in USA fighting for 'their' rights - who knew they were threatened? 

(Psst, give us a hint. Who promised whom what for votes?)
That 3rd guy from the left. He won't be working at the WH very soon because his crooked father will be Impeached & booted out in disgrace.

I see that they are remaking Sex in the City with an all male cast.
And the tiresome GOP drags out the NRA once again...sure sign they may lose!
Why doesn't President Trump just sign an executive order that anyone can open carry w/o any permit anywhere in the USA as constitution says?
At least we'd have less people to insure

@CNN BS, the NRA is full of it, talking the same shit 4the last 50 yrs abt guns being taken away yet I still have mine, so ds everyone else
White House says diabetics don’t deserve health insurance http://shareblue.com/white-house-says-diabetics-dont-deserve-health-insurance/#.WRVd-d9xXuo.twitter … via @shareblue
That awkward moment when treason lines up to have its picture taken.
So much for any pretense of keeping the "family" business separate from politics. #CorruptTrumps
Trump Shifts Rationale for Firing Comey, Calling Him a ‘Showboat’
Look at these dickless, overcompensating assholes out stumping for Russia and white supremacy. I'll keep my healthcare, thanks.
You all look like fools kissing up to Great Baby Trump. #handstoosmall4guns
@SteveDaines @DonaldJTrumpJr @GregForMontana @charliekirk11 Are our 2A rights in jeopardy?
Obama forgot to steal all your guns.

Really. This is your main concern??
Sure.  Let's all pretend that's their objective.  No really, citizens, the people pictured genuinely care about you.
Kiss of death ? You worried?
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/11/us/politics/trump-comey-firing.html?_r=0 … …
Dump the #NRA and #TrumpTrain
Concealed weapons means all of them. If guns taken, the rest will follow
No one is going after your second amendment rights. Or your freedom - except your own party. #YourDadIsPutinsCockHolster
For sure cause if they take away your gun you cant kill animals for trophies...ass
Where's @SteveDaines & @SecretaryZinke ? Aren't they still part of this boys club? At least if zinke is there, you're not 100% chickenhawk.
If jr thinks he can escape to our No. neighbor when the FBI comes looking for him, tell him there is extradition.
Last year 3 months in advance of American poll result, on 30/7/16 Fuxi successfully predicted Trump would win with rate of support(52%-54%).
The 2016 Election was over half a year, why there're still so many queries? Just show the public our previous forecast by I Ching on WeChat
I Ching Prediction&Fengshui Layout can tell you when's the best time to fire a man, to avoid troubles from public voice& make team stronger.
I think Trump needs to do Fengshui Layout, to defuse the contradiction between him and Democrats. After all that's good for him and American

I guess I'm confused, I thought you were supposed to be running the business, not working on behalf of the White House?

Love Montana!! My aunt lives near Red Lodge. Such gorgeous country & many good folks.
Great for you
"Okay guys. Who gets the first reach around"?
GOD bless, we are praying for victory
Our Second Amendment rights aren't being threatened. Dummies.
Most people in Montana despise the Trumps.

I just love how Don Snr is showing off his tiny hands.
Freedom?? Dramatic much? So pathetic.
Turn the guns on yourselves
Shoot any defenseless animals recently jr.?
Yes, it's a good thing you are fighting for 2nd Amendment rights in Montana, a well known bastion of liberal tyranny. <<<sarcasm

Awesome!!!
Now that Trump  made it ok for the mentally ill to own a gun, have a good time together! Practice makes perfect (accidents)
Then you should be happy - now you can own one too, cupcake! Now you just need to work on that bad case of #TrumpDerangementSyndrome...
Actually I work in the courts with mentally ill. you need a guardian at Leitem for your mental decisions to support a treasonous dictator.
Where is this Leitem ??? If you're referring to a "guardian ad litem," then I suggest a GAL be appointed for all of you deranged lefties.
Come visit us in Wyo while you're in MT!
Yeah, treason might be a little more important. #DontheCon @POTUS @WhiteHouse @VP

Yeah sure! Hypocrites!
Vlad is going to take those away soon!
More babies kill their gunnie parents with guns in America, than good guys kill bad guys. Keep up the good work.
whose freedom and second ammendment rights are you fighting for? Republicans?
Why don't you all just shoot each other?
Three Men and a Baby.
You're a bunch of feckless blowhards.
Dems who do you have campaigning for you? Jr was a magnet for votes in November.  Expect to be defeated May 25.  Thank this Trump when u r
Not superPAC money that's a Russian laundering machine... can you say prison trumPee?
I wonder how many women were assaulted or how many wild animals had to die for this?
How about treason you fighting for that also?
Good Job, we will fight, fight and fight some more, until we win and get rid of all these corrupt Dems so #POTUS45 can make USA Great Again
Keep up the fight. California in your sights?
As you took out your AK-47s and starting shooting little Mexicans!
You guys, with your gun fetish as cover for your masculinity insecurity, are pathetic. You'll never grow up.
Get youself to Texas we will show you insecurity
No doubt.  Been there many times.

Yes!!

We need to add President @realDonaldTrump picture in the top o

No let The Enquirer!
The Gentleman have a Room.
Which one of you had a gun taken away in the last 8 years?   #MAGA #drainthetrump
