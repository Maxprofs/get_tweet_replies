Great to see #Montana Senator @SteveDaines be a puppet and help fuck over the environment and the state he claims to represent.
Can’t tell you how much I regret giving you my vote.  Won’t happen again
When was the last #townhall ? Oh, that's right, noone can remember. Perhaps you should have another chickenshit #teletownhall to screen ???
At the #MTTechSummit you touted quality of life so we tech entrepreneurs can attract talent to MT. No #CPP = WORSE quality of life.
Scott Pruitt is a corporate shill. The Clean Power Plan wasn’t perfect and doesn’t go far enough but it was something. #cpp #MTHighTechJobs
We need to manage Scott Pruitt or Scott Pruitt (and his regent, Vladimir #Putin) will manage us #CleanPowerPlan #ClimateChange
For someone who just hosted a tech summit, your praise of this is mind boggling. #hypocrisy
Yeah who gives a shit about the planet anyway
You're a good little Trumpette! And a voting mistake I won't make again!!
Yeah! Kill clean air and water! You've always been on the right side of history, Daines. Who needs the EPA anyway? Not the GOP. #pleaseresign
Because fuck the environment for the future generations... right?
#itsanewday sounds like a return to #superfund 70’s #Montana. @SteveDaines, represent#Montana’s needs, not outside #extraction profits.
Coal is a dinosaur, a dirty Dino but you have to be the party puppet. Will you ever think for yourself and the folks in Montana?
Steve Daines is wrong on energy, wrong on jobs, wrong for Montana and USA. Shameful.
The Clean Power Plan was estimated to create a quarter-million jobs by 2020 #MTHighTechJobsSummit #Hypocrite
@SteveDaines Sad to see #EPA Administrator Pruitt taking action that kills people and long term jobs by causing #climatechange
Yep, a new day for acid rain. Way to go!!!!
I’m terribly curious about how you manage to sleep at night, Steve.
Looking forward to the we can vote you out!
Thank you for screwing us over. Way to sell out
But it’s okay to ‘kill’ clean air?  And hang on to a dwindling industry?
Why not replace coal jobs with Manufacturing clean energy jobs like producing windmills or solar panels
.@SteveDaines, bottom line: the #CleanPowerPlan protects Montanans. We need you to support these standards & #ProtectCPP. http://mtvoters.org/newsroom/mcv-criticizes-decision-to-roll-back-the-clean-power-plan/ …
You DO NOT represent me. I wish you could think independently, look at the big picture! Also why is that fox guarding our precious henhouse?
Nothing kills jobs more than having no clean air, Senator Daines.
Montana has good sun and wind so this doesn't make sense, unless you are a stooge?
He is a stooge.  Bought and paid for by corporations to increase profits not to protect citizens.
Gee @SteveDaines, I was all ready to give you an "atta boy" for the #mthightechjobs  summit and then you turn around a spout this #bullshit.
You mean doing away with our children’s access to clean air, water, land, and a life lived without disease brought on by pollution.
It’ll be great to see Montana do away with @SteveDaines & his kowtowing to 45, his self-promoting tweets & his overall distaste for the 99%.
Amen.
Job killing? Your ignorance is appalling...
You're an idiot. The Power Plan hasn't even taken effect. It's cheap natural gas that's impacting coal. And our planet benefits. Fuck off.
Yes, it's much better to have people killing pollution!  You're a backwards thinking baboon.
You and the Republican Party are a piece of work, hell bent on destroying the planet. You are bad for Montana and America!
Are you reading these tweets. I think you are wrong too. The governmental leaders are lying again about keeping coal as a major energysource
Please tell me how this benefits ALL Montanans.  I'll help you: it doesn't.
Could he explain how it helps a majority of Montanans? I'll help this time, it doesn't.
You are a joke. You care more about donor money than our state. Listen to a scientist, you fraud.
Dispiriting to see Pruitt endanger the planet with his disregard for scientific consensus, and your sycophantic praise of him. #darktimes
I totally disagree with you

You should be doing everything in your power to ensure #Montana leads in #cleanenergy development.
#itsanewday? @SteveDaines. #Pruitt’s policy in Oklahoma is responsible for earthquakes skyrocketing according to https://earthquakes.ok.gov/ 
41 in 2010, 623 in 2016. #Pruitt and his policy need to stay far away from #Montana.
What a joke. I wish you’d try to keep Montanans healthy, and build solar and wind jobs. #coalishistory
YOU HAVE TO BE FUCKING KIDDING ME STEVE!  YOU ARE CURRENTLY HOSTING A TECH SUMMIT! #CashRulesEverythingAroundSteve #mtpol #StinkySteve
Facts matter. CPP was estimated to create 360,000 jobs by 2020.
Coal is from the dark ages. Montana wilderness is our future economy
Wow. Just drove by three superfund sites today (Berkeley Pit, Silverbow Creek and Anaconda/Opportunity) MT doesn't need the EPA? Boo!
You're truly an unfathomable failure at representing us.
You're the worst
Way to lie to Montana, Steve. When the world overtakes us in the clean energy jobs of the future your part in this will be remembered.
When not supporting regressive policy, Steve enjoys working for the rich and tax hikes for the middle class. http://politicsthatwork.com/voting-record/Steve-Daines-412549 …
not impressed at all, @SteveDaines.  expect me to vote against you in the next election.
Future generations will look at pruitt, you, and the rest of your ilk with disdain.
Piss off, Steve Daines. Most of the world is going to clean energy and trying to limit greenhouse gases. Why dont you lead for a change?
He doesn't know to lead . He is a trump ass kisser
That he is indeed. A true Trump lackey.
"Job killing"? Evidence? Of course not. You are a good, little Republican foot soldier.
Just had to build “killing” into your narrative.  Market forces - less expensive natural gas & efficiency at root of coal 
It's been such a mild hurricane season, proving climate change is clearly a hoax  killing clean energy is not good for MT or humanity.
You’re going the way of the dinosaurs, Steve. We need sustainable jobs, not last century’s dead ends.
Why are you hosting a technology summit if we're going to have all these coal jobs?

So we're okay with killing clean-energy jobs of the future to save steadily declining coal jobs of the past?
#epicfail
Why? Because #climatechange isn't real? How exciting, #itsanewday for the #GOP to further damage the lives of Americans.
No. You are failing us when you ignore the environmental costs of fossil fuels. Montanans bear the costs in air pollution, ill health, fire.
