Your words are meaningless. You’re a tool for the NRA and the carnage will continue. Nothing happened after Sandy Hook, nothing will now.
#TooSoon a PERSON killed people. Paddock is responsible. Your attack on the Senator is obtuse & heartless. At least wait until dust settles
Actually, this conversation should have already been had. #TooLate for all of those killed and wounded.
This conversation is ongoing. You can’t control evil people. Good laws are needed, but give a moment for people to grieve! Be silent!
I appreciate your POV, but I won't be silent anymore.  Too much silence has allowed these acts to continue.   My conscience demands action.
I hear you. There will be a time to speak, but do soon to tragedy compels us to either pray, or stand in silent mourning with the suffering
Why do you believe that we cannot do both?  Must one exclude the other?  Of course not.
taking blood money
What does the Bible say about HYPOCRISY? 5,000 from the NRA...evil Senator, can wear a Brooks Brothers suit and a smile!

Is this true? Oklahoma Senator James Lankford received $5,000 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle?
If this is for real vote for common sense gun control, otherwise it is fake.  Speaking as life long Republican
Go to hell@SenatorLankford
Australias politicians changed gun  laws 12 DAYS after last mass shooting in 1996. Mass shootings since ZERO
Cut the crap with prayer. FIX. IT. 

It’s time for gun purchase reform and legislation! How many more must die, Senator? How many more?
You underestimate the power of prayer to a God Who cares. Your comment only adds to the confusion & pain. #ShowCompassion #TooSoon
I do show compassion. Prayer shouldn’t be used to ask a deity to fix a situation or problem. 1/2
The prayer should be to give YOU strength to help fix the situation. 2/2
Too bad you can’t do anything about it! Because background checks and closing loopholes mean zero guns, right?! FREEDOM 
ICYMI you should totally do something about it. If unborn lives matter, so do the ones being lived right now.
GUN CONTROL NOW
Senator, a simple question for you.  Do you support the current legislation that removes restrictions on silencers?  Valid question today.
Dollars to donuts, he wholeheartedly supports it.
You both are so obtuse. For crying out loud, give a MOMENT for people to grieve before you politicize this! The Senator is RIGHT to pray.
When is the right time then? How about we use today to discuss SANDY HOOK since it's been almost 5 years. Or is 5 years too soon?

or more
.@SenatorLankford took $11K+ from @NRA. He'll send thoughts, but won't vote to reduce gun violence

Urge him to #SendBackTheBloodMoney https://twitter.com/SenatorLankford/status/914845625375756289 …
Thank you it was what I could find that was documented..remember they are voting on silencers and flashsuppressors tmw..
Yes. How depressed can I get is the question..
Prayers won't fix the problems we have with guns and violence in this country senator. 
How about some gun regulations. More effective than prayers!
If you're going to be pro-life, then BE pro-life. Jesus would not own an assault rifle. Neither should anyone else.
Why are you so afraid of the gun industry that you won't stand up for reasonable and responsible gun ownership and control?   It's time.
Take your bogus prayers and shove them WAAAY on up there, along with the #NRABloodMoney you pocket when you bend over for #NRAterrorists. 
Wonderful sentiment. Makes us feel better. Hope there's a link to radical islamic terrorism so u'll do more than these empty teeets.
HOW despicable? More or less than $5,000? #NRA #NRAKills #NRABloodMoney #LasVegasShooting
#GunControlNow. My idea: If you want to own a military-grade weapon, you must enlist in your state's national guard.
Which is a well regulated militia.
Exactly.
Same old same old. Words are meaningless.
Our current lack of any sensible gun control laws is ridiculous.  Polling shows most Americans are in favor of sensible legislation.
If you won't answer, would you forward my question to the appropriate staff?  I'd like a response from my representative.


pure evil--huh. Is this NRA approved? Hmm. Your platitudes are worthless & shameful. Thoughts & prayers haven't stopped mass shootings
Australia politicians changed the law in 12 DAYS immediately after last mass shooting in 1996. Mass shootings since ZERO
Your "prayers" are bullshit. Part of this "despicable act of terror" that was "pure evil" was brought on by YOU, who accepted $5,000 from the NRA in 2016. There is blood on YOUR hands.
"Thoughts and prayers" 

Just shut up. We should be thinking how to fix this & praying for strength to elect senators who will vote against the NRA. #GunControlNow
Same empty prayers for Orlando. Give back the 3M+ and do something you #nratool.
But hey as long as the @NRA keeps funding ur campaign who cares right? It’s not as if senators could ever be in a mass shooting. Oh wait...
Prayers are just not enough. We need common sense gun control laws and congressmen who don't take NRA $ and look the other way.
Uncalled for actions of evil
@JimInhofe @RepFrankLucas how much $ are y’all/campaigns are getting from NRA? Ask families of 58 murdered if it’s too early for gun reform
My prayer is that some day you people will wake up and see that more gun control is needed. Jesus would think this is evil.
Your continued acceptance of NRA money makes you complicit in tragedy after tragedy.
You give the victims only your prayers, but you give the gun lobbies everything they ask for.
Oklahoma Senator James Lankford received $5,000 from the #NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
So
Prayers are all fine and good, but action is better.  You weren't elected to pray.  You were elected to take action. #SensibleGunLawsNOW
Yeah stop taking money from the NRA and help enact gun control laws , ur thoughts and prayersbis not gonna solve this issue.
#BloodOnYourHands
Yep your prayers are ignored by god cause your hands are full of blood. U are an enabler of this evil. Shame on you. Shame. Shame. Shame.
So is abortion.
Sir, your prayers are not sufficient. It's time to stop taking #NRA money and start voting for common sense gun control measures. #LasVegas
may you please also send the NRA their money back. or better yet donate it to save lives. thank you.
Oklahoma Senator James Lankford received $5,000 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.

I pray you stop taking blood money from the NRA!
Oklahoma Senator James Lankford received $5,000 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
this was "pure evil" as is condoning by taking money from NRA. Take action now!
No, Senator. Making guns readily available, esp. automatic weapons, is pure evil.  We must keep the NRA's $ out of legislator's pockets.
Your prayers are blasphemy. You are complicit. Bought by the @NRA.
"More civilians have been killed by guns since 1970 than all our troops in all our wars since 1776."
Stricter gun laws??!! Why do civilians need automatic weapons?? Please pass some laws!
Dear Hypocrite, stop taking money from the NRA and support some sane gun control legislation. You're disgusting.
And it's not evil to accept $5000 from the NRA to help that killer keep his human killing machines?
Pure evil is you spewing "prayers" while pocketing NRA $$. Despicable. You're done..
Sold your soul to the NRA for $5,000? 
What do you charge for a blowjob? a nickle? 

Can I buy your vote for $5,001?
The American people don't need your thoughts and prayers, they need common sense gun reform. Do your job. #GunControlNow
Get off those knees. You're not praying. You're servicing the NRA with your pants around your ankles. #BloodMoney
Did you have time to wash the blood off your hands before tweeting this?
Pray for your benefactors @NRA. The expect to get what they paid for. Don't forget who owns you.
What's Evil is refusing to VOTE for gun control. Your responsibility is to vote, not prey. 
THAT'S NOT A TYPO
#GunControlNow
Pray for the strength to enact proper gun control, instead of being idle while this inevitably happens again.
Pure evil is taking money from the NRA and watching innocent people die. Pure evil is not protecting fellow Americans  #BloodOnYourHands
Oklahoma Senator James Lankford received $5,000 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle. #actionnotprayers
$5,000
You are complicit and have blood on your hands. This gofundme is for a friend’s daughter’s friend.
Shove your thoughts and prayers and govern you cowardly NRA shill
Hey there, we SEE YOU being part of the problem/evil. Your hypocrisy is showing.
Constituent and voter - Appreciate your prayers but would prefer your action.  What are you doing to prevent further gun violence?

Prayers don't save lives. Laws and regulations do. #SendBacktheBloodMoney
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
I hope you sent at least 5k prayers. Btw. That $5k YOU accepted? That's less than $100 per person that lost life in Vegas. Worth it? #reform
what is pure evil is taking $ from the biggest Terrorist organization #NRATerrorists
Every congressman who accepts @nra $$ has blood on their hands. You included.
Despicable. Interesting choice in words. That the word I'd choose for your $5k check from the @NRA for your 2016 reelection cycle. #shame
Senator James Lankford received $5,000 from the NRA
Oklahoma Senator James Lankford received $5,000 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
Frauddddulenttttt
You receive donations from the NRA, you have blood on your hands.
Then give back the NRA money and do something about it you coward
Stop the silencer bill now!  That's how you can put your thoughts and prayers to work!  (Also. Say NO to NRA blood money!!)
@SenatorLankford The money u took from @NRA works out to be 85 bucks a corpse in #LasVagasShooting Screw your useless words & DO SOMETHING.
Oklahoma Senator James Lankford received $5,000 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle. $O MUCH FOR PRAYER$!
As a fellow okie I am embarrassed by your tweet. Yes send prayers and love, but also do something about it! Votes are coming up soon OR NOT!
Whatever
You take the NRA's money. You have blood on your hands. Get out of OK.. We won't forgot this at the polls.
I am sorry Sir, but I disagree because Prayer does not Resurrect the DEAD does it!!
Will you be returning the blood money you got from the NRA? If no, then stfu. GOP is Trump and Trump is GOP.
You received $5,000 fr @NRA last year. R U donating that $$ to #LasVagasShooting families? Or help @GLOCKInc @SmithWessonCorp @sigsauerinc
Prayers are not enough. You are Senator, do something. No one needs a personal arsenal or silencers. #GunContolNow
Bloods on your hands Jimmy. We need common sense and leadership courageous honesty.What we don’t need is silencers & auto assault on streets
Thoughts and prayers are fine but they are not enough. You have the power to help fix our gun laws! Be brave and push back on the NRA.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Pure evil are legislators who gladly accept blood money from the NRA and gun manufacturers, and then pass evil laws in their favor.
"this was pure evil".  I see "pure evil" as men who take $$$ from NRA & allow semi automatic weapons for sale.  jam your prayers
No James. It's time to take a look at gun laws. Why are ownership of assault rifles legal?  Can't hunt with them, right?
Prayers aren't going to fix mass shootings. Taking action does. #StopTheViolence
Was the NRA's $5k enough for you to continue to do nothing about gun violence besides offer "thoughts & prayers"?
Just repeating what Drump said.....sheesh
Do you have a conscious, just wondering.
#NRAKills #NRAisATerroristOrganization & You are #COMPLICIT.
#GunControlNow #KochSucker #BackgroundChecks #StopTheViolence #NoToSilencerVote
James Lankford received $5,000 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
And #SorryNotSorry the time for playing nice has expired. Look at the facts and wake up. Make the right choice and save someone’s life.
How many prayers do you gotta say before u realize they arent fucking working.Are you that dense or got your paws too far in the cookie jar?
Worthless prayers when you vote for more gun massacres & against healthcare that makes you hateful & hate-filled which is disgusting!
Pure evil is voting against common sense gun legislation because you're such a cheap purchase by the NRA. You need to pray for your soul.
Oklahoma Senator James Lankford received $5,000 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
pure evil is taking NRA money and acting like you are working to stop gun violence
You're an NRA stooge,
Praying is futile unless U pass gun control laws!
It's like praying for a truck driver who is driving in the wrong direction: imminent crash
Read it! Line upon line U will see that it's speaking of a group...
i.e. the National Guard, the Reserves
Not individuals!
#2AmendHighJacked
Oklahoma Senator James Lankford received $5,000 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
You are so swayed by the NRA, you've totally highjacked the 2Amend! Which by the way, DOES NOT GIVE #INDIVIDUALS THE RIGHTS TO BARE ARMS!
Incidentally,
the #Evil is: You people! You have Tainted Blood, Hardened Hearts, and Black Souls if you can't see the need for gun control.
