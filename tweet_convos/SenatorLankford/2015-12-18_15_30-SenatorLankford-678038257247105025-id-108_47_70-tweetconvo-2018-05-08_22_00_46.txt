@warpfactorbanjo @brithume And why Donald Trump is kicking their butts.
@warpfactorbanjo @brithume And next year, they go back to pretending to oppose Obama for the election, after giving away the store.
@brithume To much is wrong with it is an understatement. Please elaborate.
@brithume Amazing!!  What US oil company is going to export oil at $35 per barrel? Why this is a big deal when it's not going to happen?
@brithume Sometimes..half of something is better than all of nothing.
@Gatortrapper @brithume I'm sorry about your wife's loss. I'm glad that the bill is done. Not pretty. Look to 2016 for silver on EBay
@Gatortrapper @brithume @GOP no they aren't. They wanted everything they gave away too. No one represents the people anymore, just K street.
@brithume true. you're feeling lucky I guess that you won't be able to see the wreckage from The Villages. Rest of us have more to lose.
@brithume Nice, it would be, if the @GOP cared about American workers half as much as they cared about helping big oil companies.
@brithume My God, but you people are clueless. Hint: Oil exports were not a big priority or "big deal" to any of us out here.
@FormerlyFormer @brithume speak for yourself. Those who own oil rights in the US do think it is a big deal.
@theVVicked1 @brithume Goody for you. But it is not a priority in any way shape or form for vast majority of GOP voters. Which was my point.
@brithume Gave up everything for minor gain --Dems will spin-- that GOP in pocket of BIG OIL-when gas prices are higher in Fall & blame them
@brithume so he's going to veto it? Why would the @GOP threaten to shut down the government?
@brithume Ryan is just a younger version of Boehner. The GOP establishment is just giving more and more reason for GOP to vote for Trump.
@brithume Brit, this deal was a complete and total sellout. Next time you guys are confused by Trump's popularity, look at the omnibus.
@brithume Until the Dems get the press to help them lie about it near the election next year.
@brithume If the goal is to be energy independence, why do this? Did my party just sell me out to big business? Will it affect r gas prices?
Hooray for.............us? @brithume
@brithume you got to be kidding!  We spiral into debt,  Planned Parenthood, Syrian amnesty, Climate Scam Fund, and you parade proudly 1 item
@brithume It's a great thing for the US, oil, manufacturing, foreign policy, economy, you name it! https://wordpress.com/post/kerrpumpsandflowvalve.wordpress.com/43 â€¦
@brithume "But is it a big fu$&*^% deal?!?" - Joe Biden
@brithume I thought Ryan's comments were interesting:
@brithume Given your recent opposition to @realDonaldTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  I'm sure you love this liberal spending nightmare.
@brithume This is what created Trump! I was on the fence about Trump, not now!
@brithume The current resident of the White House, would never cut his nose off to spite his face. Too much at stake.
@brithume And then the @GOP will run around whining "Why does Trump's numbers keep going up?"
@brithume The republican party is dead.
@brithume -you have really lost it.
@brithume don't forget the exciting win for companies that want to import cheap foreign labor instead of hiring Americans
@brithume Not worth what was traded for. Could have waited. Unacceptable!
@brithume ....but lifting the oil export ban is a big deal... OMG Brit! What planet are you on? Bigger than funding Planned Parenthood e.g.
@brithume Keep spinning Brit, it's a friggin disaster.  The Dems are laughing at Ryan and the dem lites.
@brithume @reply He got what he wanted, and MORE.
@brithume Its a big deal for the oil lobby, for the rest of us with grandchildren burdened by this disgraceful show it's disgusting
@brithume And all they had to do to get the donor class their wubby was sell-out the base on everything else. We hate the useless bastards!
look, @brithume no one who fought for big @GOP wins in Congress cares about oil export ban. It's been #Noamnesty and #StopObama period.
@brithume http://gph.is/VxbsBT 
@brithume You're falling for that?  O had to make a show.
@brithume Oh & btw, Rubio didn't show up to vote AGAIN!! His bullshit excuse was "his absence was his statement" Don't see anyone sayin that
@brithume Oil company checks don't bounce, eh, Britt?
@brithume what a, er, triumph for the American people.
@brithume Much wrong?? It's ALL WRONG! And we the ppl got screwed!! PP is still funded along w Obamacare! GOP rinos can kiss my ass!!!
@brithume this is bad for Republicans..unfortunately people will remember this at the polls.  Trump will not win Hillary.
@brithume Shill.
@brithume and now what? Will it cut our supply and raise the price of gas at the pump?
@brithume Leftists use energy to extort the nation.They trade incremental improvements in energy policy in exchange for their leftist agenda
@brithume ...and that is why Trump is on top.  Idiot or lackey, you lost a lot of support on that statement.  -5 respect
@brithume How to lose your base but keep your donors: Step 1.
@brithume Was lifting oil ban worth the amount that was given up? We have a BIG spending bill that rests right on MY shoulders.
@brithume So why is it good to sell our oil when it's at all time low prices?
@brithume Tell me something, Brit. How does allowing oil companies to sell US oil abroad promote conservative principles?
@TorchOWyatt @brithume promoting free market economics is a conservative principle.
@pctreadway Yeah, sure. Do you really believe that's why they put it in there? @brithume
@brithume wish we could veto him !!
@brithume isn't this the part where you troll the "trolls" who keep saying the GOP.leadership rolls over like an obedient puppy 4 N0bama?
@brithume Bearded Paul Ryan is evil... Bearded Spock is evil, Bearded data is...
@brithume what good does it do to lift it now with world oil glut. Why not try that under new #gop president later and hold the line now.
@brithume You give me a pile of crap with a dollar bill stuck in it, it is still a pile of crap.
@brithume big deal to whom?  Chamber of Commerce?
@brithume Huge win Obama & Democrats. Huge loss by GOP who didn't keep single campaign promise to voters. 2014 & 2015 Omnibus epic cave
@brithume This is a BAD deal for Amer. workers. Seems same team that negotiated Iran deal negotiated this deal.
@brithume what? O gets everything he wants plus, dems openly laugh at scam job they pulled off & u maintain that O was going to veto this??
@brithume Please spit out the Koolaid, ya RINO.
@brithume so disappointed in you Britt... #republicanpartyisdead
@brithume Cannot wait to pull the lever for Trump in 2016! 
#letitburn
@brithume Rubio needs to be asked where he was when it came time to vote today. Thought he wanted to be Pres. Oil deal is BIG
@brithume U can;t be that clueless! Obama got everything
& another $1.6 trillion to complete his nefarious agenda. 
Omnibus is end of GOP.
@brithume let's talk about Term Limits!!!
@brithume The 'threat' was a clue to repubs not to get uppity.
@brithume sick and tired of republican wimps in charge.  #establismentlosers
@brithume nice try covering for your establishment buddies...this bill is a disaster #trump2016 #ImNotALowInformationVoter #RyanTheRino
@brithume they are gone Brit.  #establismentlosers
@brithume What will that do for Americans, other than raise the cost of gasoline very slightly?
@brithume In your opinion would lifting export ban raise fuel prices in USA by lowering supply?
@brithume  gonna get rid of the establishment.  #establismentlosers
@brithume Even Schumer's SMH over this one.  Just keeps getting better and better. #Sigh
@brithume Not really in the long term best interest of the public but I'm sure money crossed hands so the public can be bleeped!
@brithume oh come on, that's how you're going to try and sell this shit sandwich?
@brithume @ssmfarley777 Let the ass veto it
@brithume You're a hack.
@brithume Please explain why this is a big deal. It seems like a pretty small deal to me.
@brithume Pubbies will be charging to the polls next year crying, "They ended the OEB. Gotta vote for them."
@brithume yes but that's like promising you lobster unlimited as the last meal before your execution. There is no good bad deal.
@brithume When I want my 5y/o to do something I threaten to take something away and then give it back when he does what I say. GOP= my 5y/o
@brithume Let him threaten. We can sit on our oil while the price is low and after he's gone we can sell when the price is up. WhoopteeDoo.
@brithume I'd like to buy you a clue. My present to you this Kwanzaa season. #cuckservative #GOPestablishment
@brithume will Obama shut down the government over it? Oh yeah, the rest of the msm will blame the GOP
@brithume Your grandkids will be slaves to the debt holders of this reckless spending but Goodie we can now sell oil exports great deal!
@brithume Obama is a feckless fool.No news here.Very little good about bill, but we have to dance with the congress that brung us. For now
@brithume Trump just won the election . Thanks Paul Ryan..
@brithume Did Paul Ryan hand deliver those talking points?
@brithume Did it cost over a trillion dollars to lift a ban?
@brithume Brit everything is wrong with that spending plan!
@brithume we got screwed with Bohner 2.0: Ryan.
@brithume There are those(American consumers)who feel the export ban lifting just another bad piece of another bad deal
@brithume A big deal for whom, Brit? This kind of statement is why GOP is in for a very rude awakening from its voters.
@brithume Just the rich taking care of each other. @USChamber and K Street rule. @GOP is a joke.
@brithume So they get everything and we get 1 thing. yay. This just handed Trump the election by the way
