Why sign anything with @SenJohnMcCain 's name on it? He has obstructed everything the @GOP campaigned on. Take the traitor's name off of it.
Good.
Good start. But why not just repeal it?
Fact check. Not true. At all.
An exemption for Puerto Rico will not doom an entire industry.
Tons of goods are sitting in PR in containers & no way to distribute. Exempting #JonesAct is simple showboating. They need trucks & drivers.
The #JonesAct has stifled PR's economic development for decades.
Thank you! Much needed!
Finally some true christian behavior out of Washington.
Good step, now let's get it passed!
Anything you do with McCain can NOT be good. Time for you to go!!  @ComfortNumb14 @JGilliam_SEAL
Senator, you are a Neo-con and have no business in Washington! You are clearly not in POTUS's court! Leave to MAGA!
PuertoRico has beenin socialism so long they don't know rugged individualism there Instead of gratitude they are talking what others haven't
That is considerate of you! Thank you for working on a bill that will actually help someone other than the wealthy, corporations and oil
Thank you Senator! What an amazing move. I'm grateful for your leadership in this with Sen McCain and Sen Lee. Thank you!
Thank you. Please condemn Trump's attacks on the Mayor of San Juan, his constant golfing, show that this isn't a partisan issue.
I don't always agree with you, but this is a good idea for the future of PR. Good Job!
#WASTEOFTIME What "container-ship" shortage you addressing? So..."LIBERAL" Puerto Rico is BANKRUPT, and infrastructure in ruins? #CORRUPTION
tie it to healthcare reform repeal and replace OBAMAS FAILED GIVAWAY OF MY MONEY !
Why is the president bringing up Puerto Rico's debit vs. sending needed help to US citizens? This is Mafia style extortion? @realDonaldTrump
About time! It should have always been a given.
Can we just abolish the Jones Act entirely?#PuertoRico is reminding us that protectionism doesn’t just destroy jobs. It destroys lives
Thank you, sir! That is the Humane thing to do for our fellow citizens!
Excellent work!
Birds of a feather...
God Bless you both.. Save the people of Puerto Rico! Their lives matter. 
Reach out to my senator @PattyMurray
Wonder what is in it for McCain. If you want to ruin your political career keep working with that traitor.
Hopefully a step towards full repeal of Jones Act
McCain is almost a century old, too. We should permanently abolish him.
yes great news
Congress leaving town w/o dealing with CSRs? We're not even trying to be good people anymore?
Thank you Senator Lankford for being part of the solution.
Already too late for the lives lost & those soon to be lost as a result of @realDonaldTrump & @GOP BEAST inaction. Even so FIX IT NOW!
Are you siding with McCain because he was such a supporter of Healthcare reform.  Sad.  Why do you side with folks that do support Healthc
How are you doing on tax reform?  Hopefully better than you did on healthcare.  Sorry if Oklahomans like me expect results you have failed
Well done! Cheers from the L

You're heading in a good direction these days.
Anything with McCain is a joke!!
Thank you. Please don't let Trump chg these Americans for their evacuations.
Build the wall. No DACA.
Something from you I can get behind, thank you! - Now don't let Trump charge them for evacuations please.
Can we exempt McCain too?
With Songbird McCain! That should be a goody. How about health care?
Well done.

Self proclaimed "King of Debt" forces Puerto Rican refugees to sign promissory notes for travel. Now THAT’S a pig!

Thank you
The ships are THERE! They Can't offload the stuff!!! Don't be stupid followers of bs artist, McCain!
Don't make a damn if there's no way to unload shit! God! McCain has GOT TO GO!

Thank you.
Quit working with the sell-outs! America hates them losers. How about being more like Steve Russell?????????????????????????????????????????
So many suffered due to dangerous Dotard Don. Wake up @GOP Have courage of @SenBobCorker, dump Trump! #ImpeachTrump
Finally. Glad to hear. Funny how you had zilch to say about PR until Trump initially suspended Jones for PR. Where was your backbone then?
Hey I’m NOT a Russian bot! Please sign petition to get @DeptofDefense out of @NFL ! https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/suspend-taxpayer-money-department-defense-participation-all-national-football-league-events … #NoFansLeft

Bravo, Senator!
Thank you!  Following McCain's lead is where you need to be at this point.
