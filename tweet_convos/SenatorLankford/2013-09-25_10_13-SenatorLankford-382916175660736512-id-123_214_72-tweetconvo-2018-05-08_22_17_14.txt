@SpeakerBoehner @BarackObama president Obama.. I hope that the GOP grows up and realizes how many Americans need Obamacare!
@SpeakerBoehner congress needs to stop hating the president and start loving Americans. Never saw such idiots as GOP.
@SpeakerBoehner my friend lost her husband. She is on social security due to an illness. She has a teenage daughter. She needs Obamacare!
@SpeakerBoehner I only wish you and the other congress members didn't have insurance, then you would be singing a different tune!
@SpeakerBoehner you need to do what the Americans want... It's health care! Stop playing games with it!
@SpeakerBoehner @pegalios Why aren't you helping Senate minority whip Republicans into supporting @SenTedCruz?

@SpeakerBoehner @patrioticDAR Then YOU need to wrangle in McCain, McConnell and other RINOs to stop this bad legislation.
@SpeakerBoehner it is a law though, right? So... It doesn't really fit with the other choices. Not a compelling argument.
@SpeakerBoehner  and that my misguided friend only a small example what is wrong with the House.  #defundrepublicans
@SpeakerBoehner Veteran Programs? You idiots treat illegals better than veterans!!

@SpeakerBoehner Or we will find someone who will.
@SpeakerBoehner And your point would be?  #OBAMACARE SIGNED SEALED #DELIVERING AND THERE AIN'T NOTHING YOUR STUPID SIGN CAN DO ABOUT IT.
@SpeakerBoehner Don't send me propaganda. SHOW me action. Quit cooperating with our Socialist President. Pick a side and ACT!
@SpeakerBoehner that yours! I didn't see it. We need #Obamacare
@SpeakerBoehner Why don't you want to fund ObamaCare? Why do you think health care for all Americans is a bad thing?
@SpeakerBoehner Fantastic. 1/1000th of the population has seen it. That really is remarkable, Speaker and staff....
@SpeakerBoehner how about fixing #Obamacare! Attempting to defund it is wasting time and our tax dollars. #Fixtheproblem
@SpeakerBoehner your Dr called and your prescription for a set of testicles is ready for you to pick up
@SpeakerBoehner Why don't you and your party start thinking about 99% of this country and stop campaigning for 2015 already! Do your job!
@SpeakerBoehner give it up!
@SpeakerBoehner please don't lie sir. You tied Obamacare onto the other things so that if it doesn't go your way you kill everything else.
@SpeakerBoehner delusions from the right....
@SpeakerBoehner thanks Mr. speaker! Why the sudden change of heart?!  I hope you stay on the side of the people!
