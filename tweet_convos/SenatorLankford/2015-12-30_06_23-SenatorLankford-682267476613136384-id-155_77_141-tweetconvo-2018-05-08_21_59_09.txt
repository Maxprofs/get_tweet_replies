@SpeakerRyan hey thanks for not caring about womens health...thats what we need another man telling a woman what to do...asshole
@SpeakerRyan @SpeakerBoehner too little too late. Treasonous omnibus driver!
@Blob_Fish @SpeakerRyan you have to pay taxes before you can bitch about how they are spent.A real man makes sure his children have food.
@SpeakerRyan and the GOP plan is...die faster...it's cheaper that way.
@SpeakerRyan UR screwed! Hand in UR resignation & leave DC with class!
@SpeakerRyan > Last thrashes & throws of a #WhiteSupremacist Party. @GOP #Hates #America #WomenWorkersBlacksMuslimsLatinasPoor - y'all sick!
@2Freelancer @SpeakerRyan @GOP If anyone hates blacks, it's blacks. Shameful the babies that r aborted. And the government protects it.
@angela40312 @SpeakerRyan @GOP > Excuse me! But you should know facts, white Christian women have the most abortions. You've been lied to.
@2Freelancer @SpeakerRyan @GOP https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=8&ved=0ahUKEwjA17G01YTKAhUO3WMKHSm0B4AQFggiMAc&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abort73.com%2Fabortion_facts%2Fus_abortion_statistics%2F&usg=AFQjCNEXGYpKyknlxSEEdYzQXjq7JGB8_g&sig2=pMZutJwD3lnvBgcx3o6mzw … 
These statistics say black women r 3.6 times more likely to have abortions.
@angela40312 @SpeakerRyan @GOP > Back in '80s I worked at Preterm. I saw mostly young white girls. Victims of incest, promiscuous & battered
@2Freelancer @SpeakerRyan @GOP So u saw the babies bodies being pulled apart? Please Jesus, I hope u have all of their souls n ur arms. 
@angela40312 @SpeakerRyan @GOP >Look, this is America, do you know what that means? If you saw a unwed woman w/6 kids you pissed abt welfare
@2Freelancer @SpeakerRyan @GOP If obama can give trillions to our enemy's, he can take care of our children!
@SpeakerRyan Which you know will be vetoed. Kabuki theater much?
@Blob_Fish @MMAInvestments @SpeakerRyan is this a joke
@6oh4p @Blob_Fish @SpeakerRyan umm no...facts...actually they voted more than 50x to repeal O-Care..that O would have had to sign off on..
@MMAInvestments @Blob_Fish @SpeakerRyan nevermind. i should know better than to discuss politics with anyone anymore
@6oh4p @Blob_Fish @SpeakerRyan lol..so the GOP Congress didn't vote to repeal O-Care 50x?..a total waste of time..
simple those who don't have money for their medical problems need planned parent hood & ACA @SpeakerRyan
@SpeakerRyan both are pre planned political decisions not thought out properly. real intel report
@SpeakerRyan you are wasting American taxpayers' money. Obamacare despite your lying about it, helps people like me! I had preexisting cond.
@SpeakerRyan @SenatorLankford both of you are such a joke.  Vote for the 1.1 trillion budget that funds all of this.    Times Up.   #Cowards
@SpeakerRyan @SpeakerBoehner you can't win. He will VETO it. Thank you very much.
@SpeakerRyan What the hell is wrong with you people? The ACA is helping alot of people who wouldn't normally have insurance get health care.
@Nicci64 Not really. They are paying premiums but deductibles are so high they can't afford to use the coverage. Nice try though.
@BillUnderwood8 @Nicci64 yes really. Premiums and deductible are awful because of... Free market. Ins. co's reaped big $$$ before ACA too.
@SpeakerRyan 300 THOUSAND VISA'S ANOTHER OBAMA MAN.A JOKE!
you go after a education on the need of a working family, better pay we have earned it...@SpeakerRyan
@SpeakerRyan I'll believe it when I see it!
@SpeakerRyan women"s healthcare is not something the GOP will tolerate. Die is their answers
@SpeakerRyan @SpeakerBoehner seriously?? You gave away the farm on the omnibus, now you have #noleverage, good thinking!
@SpeakerRyan Ryan is a great leader, w/ principles & integrity! So glad he is the Speaker! Now we just need to elect Rubio! What a great duo
@SpeakerRyan hmmmm...which way to bet? I think I'll go with....BILL DEFEATED!
Seriously, you clowns never learn, do you?
@SpeakerRyan Cool..."going after it." Sounds like intelligent fiscal strategy. Please outline the plan you're going to put in its place.
@SpeakerRyan I mean, it would be truly foolish to just yank people's insurance away from them...why?...because you dislike a President?
@SpeakerRyan please tell me who wok be running against him so I can contribute to them
@SpeakerRyan Talk is cheap Sir,The people lost trust. One bow hunter to another, calm yourself, remember who you are and take the shot.
@SpeakerRyan Y doesn't #GOP put bills forward that accomplish something instead of "going after" healthcare? #Obamacare #PlannedParenthood
@SpeakerRyan You know America thinks you such as a speaker and yet you know this isn't going anywhere. But u still are a joke
@SpeakerRyan hopefully the pilots bill of Rights 2 will hit the floor right after this so we can get a bill he will sign through also! Thks
@SpeakerRyan @SpeakerBoehner Lame & lamer.
@SpeakerRyan @SpeakerBoehner you R a spineless puppet... #termlimits is what's needed
@SpeakerRyan @SenatorLankford you are a joke! Harry Reid played you like fool. We the People have had enough
@SpeakerRyan And this will help assure Democrats in the White house for years to come. Thanks moron.
@SpeakerRyan You are aware that @PPact video LIAR has been charged with his crimes - amiright?
@SpeakerRyan @SenatorLankford hopefully Ryan will be the shortest acting speaker. Another sellout brought to you by the GOP.
@SpeakerRyan @PatrickHenryQ Thanks For Nothing!
Fuck you then.
MT @SpeakerRyan: We’re going after #ObamaCare & #PlannedParenthood.

#ImAgainstTheGOP

#StandWithPP
@SpeakerRyan @SenatorLankford   Its about time
@SpeakerRyan You should not have Fully Funded Planned Parenthood to begin with! #Backstabber
@SpeakerRyan and it will be vetoed. Get over it.
.@SpeakerRyan Stop trying to defund Planned Parenthood! For the love of god just stop, it's not even funny anymore.
@SpeakerRyan RIght-wing representatives love their taxpayer funded cadillac health care though, correct? #SinglePayer
@SpeakerRyan they say they are loyal to you and the country until it suits them not to be. Can't trust conservatives.
@SpeakerRyan running scared from your insane base?
@SpeakerRyan and you know it will get Vetoed, dude everyone is on to your GOP pathetic tricks
@SpeakerRyan Why????    You are just wasting our hard earned tax $.
@SpeakerRyan You are as unethical as Boehner. Rolling over to insur/pharma or #Racism toward @potus. Americans need ACA
@SpeakerRyan LOL!  A toothless tiger. You should have attached it to a bill he couldn't veto. This is a joke.
@SpeakerRyan @SpeakerBoehner you maybe sending it but you have no intention on enforcing it.
@SpeakerRyan 

Better idea: put bills on his desk that actually do something useful to better the lives of Americans.
@SpeakerRyan  First Class Ass Hole!
@SpeakerRyan u don't has a lotta support on Twitter, eh, they fuken hate u. #Boehnerwasbetter
@SpeakerRyan @sassy_gramma Please destroy #ObamaCare.  Most U.S. citizens are sick of the high prices and forced taxes from it.
.@niebais1 @SpeakerRyan @sassy_gramma Single payer.Only reason the The GOP doesn't go along with it is because they R in bed with big pharma
@warcrimesbush No! No! No! No! No!  I don't want to be on medicaid.  Govt out of medicine is the only option. @SpeakerRyan @sassy_gramma
@SpeakerRyan Great, something else you spineless hacks can do so Obama can veto it #toolittletoolate
@SpeakerRyan @LibertyBell1000 You're a real tough guy now Ryan. You cause the prob & then pretend to fix it. Lying establishment hack
@SpeakerRyan why now?  Now that you funded it all in Omnibus... and pols wonder why the people are pissed off art DC....
@SpeakerRyan @LibertyBell1000 Whatever dude...
@SpeakerRyan You seem to think u r still in the Caucus Rest GOP obstruction mtg in Jan 2009. Wake up Rip!
@SpeakerRyan #TrumplivespeechNOW Trump live speech happening now in SC. Listen in, hear the truth for a change! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0hEenr2wYM …
@SpeakerRyan @SpeakerBoehner you sad sad delusional men.
@SpeakerRyan Republicans have lied for so long obamacare and abortion! U won elections on these promises! We r idiots for ever believing u!!
@SpeakerRyan looks like CYA to me. It had a chance in the financial bill. The conservatives are watching. Are your going to lead or not?
@SpeakerRyan you had your chance and blew it. You are in the pocket of your cronies no point in acting like you care. #weak #sellout
@SpeakerRyan How about you pass something that actually helps someone? And I don't mean your billionaire contributors, either.
@charley047 @JustaSlob @SpeakerRyan Well said Charley.
@SpeakerRyan why not try doing something productive for a change.
@SpeakerRyan; What's It Say? A "White-Fright-Right House Of Representatives" who Prioritize RE-LITIGATING Laws Enacted 5 & 43 Years Ago? ..
@SpeakerRyan @nevagphx1 wow fully fund both then attempt to CYA. pathetic
@SpeakerRyan BFD you already funded all that. What a RINO FRAUD.
@SpeakerRyan How come I don't feel so good about your leadership.  I don't see a difference.
@SpeakerRyan Still refusing to do anything of value?
@sultryglebe @SpeakerRyan Babies r the most thing of value! Cutting them up when almost full term is disgusting! U r shameful!
@SpeakerRyan stop saying and start doing. We've heard this same song and we're tired of it do something instead of talking about
@SpeakerRyan Hahahahaha!
@SpeakerRyan A meaningless gesture after already funding both. You had the chance to stop both, but you wimped out. It is the republican way
@SpeakerRyan Kind of hard now to go after Planned Parenthood now that you funded them through the Omnibus Bill!
@SpeakerRyan Who keeps voting for Harry Reid in Nevada?  Please vote for someone else!
@SpeakerRyan those are just words. Empty words. Do you really think we believe this bill will accomplish anything? It won't & we know it.
@SpeakerRyan POTUS will veto & GOP Omnibus surrendered all leverage. Any EFFECTIVE actions in GOP Congress plans for 2016.
@SpeakerRyan Harry Reid said no way
@SpeakerRyan @patpaule
@SpeakerRyan @SpeakerBoehner the way to stop Obamacare is through the budget process. This is a meaningless bill to cover your deception.
@SpeakerRyan You had your leverage with the omnibus.  You gave it away.  The Dems are laughing at us.
@SpeakerRyan Is just Boehner 2.0...too bad. We had such high hopes 4 u...
@SpeakerRyan You look pretty stupid funding those efforts in your trillion dollar Omnibus bill. Why didn't u defund them when u had chance?
@SpeakerRyan what a waste of bloody time.
@SpeakerRyan BS, lets see it
@SpeakerRyan @SpeakerBoehner Just more sugar coated BULLSHIT from the speaker!! We hold the majority in the House and Senate, Shame on you!!
@SpeakerRyan  This is when the BS starts. You fund it then you vote on bills against it. You must think we're stupid. #partybeforecountry
@SpeakerRyan really - or just more hot air ]
Yeah, sure thing boss @SpeakerRyan @SpeakerBoehner 
We believe you
@SpeakerRyan BS
@SpeakerRyan Your interview is laughable! You own it all. Get ready for a primary. Can you say @EricCantor?
@conservativevin @SpeakerRyan @EricCantor 
So who is his primary crhallenger?
@SpeakerRyan  I just bet you are...what offering him more money? You're  not a Republican. Boy was I blindsided...you're  another Pelosi!!!
@SpeakerRyan  Is that right?   After you gave blanket funding for it.  That is laughable...
@SpeakerRyan Why the hell didn't you just not fund it? Because you are supported by lobbyist wanting the ACA and PPH, that is why.
@SpeakerRyan about time! Make him the veto president
@idnov @SpeakerRyan   NICE ONE !   I might just respect you Miller lmao

@SpeakerRyan @JustCrum79 yeah sure you're a sellout Who are you going to benefit this time around with the new bills not American people
@SpeakerRyan ... oh really.   Think you make it happen?   This will be fun to watch.
@SpeakerRyan So you were for it before you were against it?
@SpeakerRyan that's the repugnant repukes. Go after poor cuz it will make the toothless trailer trash base of yours happy. They will eat u.
@SpeakerRyan I don't believe u will do anything that is actually good for the country or has a chance to work. U r doing this for show
@SpeakerRyan I am not against insurance for the poor,just not Obamacare,Healthcare in general needs reform.It is crazy.
@SpeakerRyan y did u fund planned parenthood in the new spending bill to begin with?
@SpeakerRyan why?
@SpeakerRyan @SpeakerBoehner ...again? Restore to the breath of fresh air viz-a-viz politics as usual style of your predecessor.
@SpeakerRyan You keep repeating the lie that military spending was ever in peril under a partial shutdown. U've decided 2 be part of problem
@LisaMaret @SpeakerRyan I love what @SpeakerRyan is doing cannot wait till 2017 and the doors open at the WH and all the shit is thrown out.
@sherrig04320489 @LisaMaret @SpeakerRyan Oh Sherri. https://youtu.be/zFxGtIqqwT4 
@SpeakerRyan @JustCrum79 Bill Bennett, one of the few smart men left on talk radio.
@SpeakerRyan PLEASE, do u really think the people are that Dumb! You voted on the Omnibus to fund all of them.
@SpeakerRyan why do you want to stop health care that is helping many, why not get smart and work together and improve it!!Time to wake up!
@SpeakerRyan @SpeakerBoehner This is pandering to the lowest common denominator, not governing.
@SpeakerRyan lol, and what kind of BS is buried in the hundreds of pages of this bill???
@SpeakerRyan time to look into details of the plan! Overall concept great, details lacking and hurts lots
@SpeakerRyan ....which won't pass unless the golf and taxes, outweigh the not golf and not taxes
@SpeakerRyan You already funded both those things in the Omnibus bill. You gave up the power of the purse long ago. GOP = toothless.
@SpeakerRyan lololololololololol this is some funny crap, a bill going after Obamacare after you have already fund it
@SpeakerRyan Total disappointment so far.  4 years of majority and yet to have just 1 win.  Bunch of god dam useless legislators.
@PoBastid @SpeakerRyan Useless President Mr know it all. Look facts.
https://youtu.be/5ld3Py4ooJg 
@SpeakerRyan New Speaker, same ridiculous policies
@gils9965 @warcrimesbush @SpeakerRyan maybe the microphone  has a gop problem.....
@SpeakerRyan you will be in the Unemployment line after that disastrous Omnibus budget.
@SpeakerRyan ugh come on Ryan, this will go nowhere and you know it. Your constituents are bat shit crazy, you have my sympathies
