@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight @dennygirltwo @jjauthor @RedNationRising @DRUDGE_REPORT @SenTedCruz Go Patriots GO!!! #AbolishIRS
@DarrellIssa @niceninja @GOPoversight Notice how Democrats vote in lock-step against allowing the American people to know the truth #IRS
@marklindesr @niceninja @DarrellIssa @GOPoversight  that's because most all #Democrats are #SocialistCommunist sympathizers
@DarrellIssa @dkmkc2000 @GOPoversight so why cant aaron hernandez & zimmerman plead 5th & get off wi no punishment?
@dkmkc2000 @DarrellIssa @GOPoversight but hey, if govt employees set precedent of no charges then why cant private citizens have no charges
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight Whether or not u agree w/the assumed actions of Lois Lerner,U cannot pick & choose when the Constitution applies.
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight  Lois Lerner should have claimed her 5th A rights & said nothing else. She said her atty said not to say anything
@DarrellIssa @RedLugh @GOPoversight Why would the President not fire her immediately for taking the 5th?
.@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight press on with a subpoena, and if that doesn't get her talking...WATERBOARDING!!!!
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight   So What? What are you doing about it today? Enjoy your 4th Mr status quo.NO urgency with you people.
@DarrellIssa @dennygirltwo @GOPoversight Does Congress have a punishment for defying it?  Other than just words, like Contempt of Congress?
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight dems support Constitution when it serves their agenda/purpose!
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight what r u going to abt it after she puked in ur face? @LadinoTurk @BossHoggUSMC
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight "No person shall be compelled in any criminal case2be a witness against himself"
Nothing about opening statements
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight okay.then.  She appears, answers, or is fired AND prosecuted.  Why do employees get the 5th option?
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight seems no one is in a hurry to fix this or any of the other deadly problems/scandals we face.
@DarrellIssa  @GOPoversight Lerner=Lib arrogance-Answers no questions, declares innocence as gospel, refuses 2 resign, no work but gets paid
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight In a few months when nothing comes out of this, you'll come up with something else
17 dummies “@DarrellIssa: .@GOPoversight voted 22-17 that Lois Lerner did waive her fifth amendment privilege. http://bit.ly/14CwIbt  #IRS”
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight Why  collecting paycheck?  People who don't know or take the 5th should have pay suspended. Have courage.
.@DarrellIssa @semperbuzz @GOPoversight I'm assuming that the taxpayers paid for her two lawyers who advised her it was OK?  Dumbasses.
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight Yeah. I don't see how you can claim the fifth and then say you've done nothing wrong.
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight If Obama uses his next 3 years as he plans to, Lois Lerner will not matter.
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight It only took them 6 weeks to state the obvious. Even then apparently 17 somehow didn't get it. Too slow.
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight In effect, she testified while not under oath, but apparently is unwilling to give the same testimony under oath.
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight If she doesn't testify, panel should consider charges of conspiracy, long suspension without pay or simply fired!
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight So now you are a SCOTUS justice too? Deciding who relinquished rights? n.b.GOP oversight s/b GOVT- @davidgregory
@DarrellIssa @GregWHoward @GOPoversight Sure glad your there Rep Issa,What a circle deception & corruption, that vote says 17 agree
@DarrellIssa @dennygirltwo @GOPoversight Looking forward to her coming back.
@DarrellIssa Once more into the breach,sir!
@DarrellIssa @ResistTyranny @GOPoversight keep fighting Darrell! You're a great American! God Bless You!
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight of course she did but the Obama Admin is getting away with it again & again due to Republican's failure to #Unite
@DarrellIssa @CAPTDSPAWN5 @GOPoversight crush that lying bitch!
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight Does GARRITY v. NJ, 385 U.S. 493(1967) apply? We should at the very least fire them. I'm hoping perp walk though!
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight If that's the case, then bury her! Get after it! #tcot #ccot @HouseFloor @TGowdySC @SenTedCruz @SCF
@DarrellIssa @deanmeek @GOPoversight She should be in jail not on the payroll.
@DarrellIssa @deanmeek @GOPoversight ;LERNER SHOULD ALSO BE CITED FOR CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS.
@DarrellIssa @deanmeek @GOPoversight And she should be FIRED.  She had NO right to do what she did.  Can't profess innocent, plead 5th.
@DarrellIssa @deanmeek @GOPoversight I heard Cummings squeeling.What is wrong with him?  He must not care about his people, just his donors.
@JereeGeeStavich @DarrellIssa @deanmeek @GOPoversight Cummings revealed his colors when he tried to end IRS oversight investigation.
@DarrellIssa FINALLY
@DarrellIssa YEA, but what? Who were the 17 who voted that Lois Lerner didn't waive her 5th amendment privilege? @Stips620 @GOPoversight
“@DarrellIssa: .@GOPoversight voted 22-17 that Lois Lerner did waive her fifth amendment privilege. http://bit.ly/14CwIbt  #IRS DO SOMETHING
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight when is she coming back?
@DarrellIssa @CynthiaSpeaks @GOPoversight Does that means that articles of impeachment are forth coming?
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight 
This is good news. What's next?
“@DarrellIssa: .@GOPoversight voted 22-17 that Lois Lerner did waive her fifth amendment privilege. http://bit.ly/14CwIbt  #IRS”
.@Bflyboy13 @DarrellIssa @GOPoversight It bothers me that it was a party line vote about holding IRS responsible for party line targeting.
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight thank you Sir!
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight Good news!
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight Pursue the truth like rabid dogs!!!!
@DarrellIssa @Illiberalality @GOPoversight BRING HER BACK !
@DarrellIssa. Horray!
@DarrellIssa should be put to trial for wasting money with his political witch hunt trials @GOPoversight
.@DarrellIssa You're making Joseph McCarthy proud (and the Founders sad) @GOPoversight
.@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight The vote on Lerner is so SHOCKING !  Darrell Issa is bad for the country and bad for GOP. #Arson
@DarrellIssa Of course, she did. She should be stripped of benefits immediately pending hearing!
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight Stay on task there, Darrell, so we know where you are and what you are doing.  Keeps you out of trouble.
Party line “@DarrellIssa: .@GOPoversight voted 22-17 that Lois Lerner did waive her fifth amendment privilege. http://bit.ly/14CwIbt  #IRS”
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight What is wrong with admin not pushing people to support these investigations?  We're getting nowhere.
@DarrellIssa @gopoversight How does that work. Why is a vote required? I feel uneasy with votes determining constitutional protections.
I don't believe you can force her to incriminate herself. She can still plead Q by Q. Offer limited immunity. @DarrellIssa @gopoversight
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight - great news. Thank goodness. Now lets find out who is responsible.
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight so what's next?
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight GOOD WORK!
Boom --> RT @DarrellIssa 37m .@GOPoversight voted 22-17 that Lois Lerner did waive her fifth amendment privilege. #IRS
@redsteeze @DarrellIssa @GOPoversight Let me guess; voted by party line? Any crossovers?
RT @DarrellIssa: .@GOPoversight voted 22-17 that Lois Lerner did waive her fifth amendment privilege. http://bit.ly/14CwIbt  #IRS
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight Quit the witch hunts.  We want JOBS! Overturn Citizens United.  Say no to Keystone & pass Immigration
.@DarrellIssa @Elky305 @GOPoversight THANK GOODNESS FOR REPUB MAJORITY... Otherwise she gets Away with criminal actions.
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight ~ She NEEDS to be PROSECUTED to the full extent of the law!
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight Thank you Darrell. Please stay on top of this. The American people are furious  over all of the scandals inc. IRS
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight get um! In the words of Ricky Ricardo "You got some splainin to do!"
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight "Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, and the truth." We the People appreciate your efforts.
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight Bravo Rep. Issa, the other side is obviously for protecting Lerner,& not the American people
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight Thank you.  Liberals keep claiming partisanship and ignoring their responsibility to the people.  Shameful.
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight HA!
@DarrellIssa Clapper lies to congress and nothing happens.  Dems are running out the clock on the scandals.  We need more aggressive action.
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight NAIL this woman to the WALL.  You had better start dismantling this regime, or we are all done for.
Now get the truth or hold her in contempt!! @DarrellIssa @hawkeyedriver @GOPoversight
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight That this vote was along party lines, shows that Dems R not interested in getting the Truth, merely covering-up.
@DarrellIssa what are you going to do about it?  So far we have seen no accountability  2 IRS agents plead the 5th and still on payroll.
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight #GoGetEm
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight I guess Lerner is not protected by the Constitution, what a joke.Constitution only applies when GOP want it to.
@DarrellIssa well...this will be interesting...me thinks Lerner should fire the attorney who advised her to begin with #IRS #accountability
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight Thank you!
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight Did Congress Approve The U.S. Arming Of Syrian Rebels ? http://capitalisminstitute.org/arming-syrian-rebel/ … … … … … … …
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight This should have been done the day after she pleaded the fifth.  No more dog and pony shows. #Accountability
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight She should now be compelled to testify, without a deal for amnesty.
Yes, but sir, when you drag her back, and she pleads 5th again, properly this time,  then what?  @DarrellIssa @GOPoversight #explainthat1
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight Now what are u going to do about it?  This admin breaks the law every day knowing nothing will ever be done
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight OK great!  Get her back in there ASAP!  No delays, no excuses!
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight thank god Graham , Rubio, kirk,mc cain etc ....wasn't there
@DarrellIssa @lisa_whittemore @GOPoversight thanks for standing for the truth #tcot
@FernandoAQuezad @DarrellIssa @lisa_whittemore @GOPoversight AMEN!
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight Well, I guess its time to get out the water boards again. Is this really worth the effort? What do you gain?
@ravngsofamadman @DarrellIssa @GOPoversight Hadn't thought about the water boarding scenario...hmmmm...
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight OK, Congressman, now what?  Bring her back to testify?  How about some action that is not just theater.
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight You are my heroes up there. Keep up the good work.
@DarrellIssa @GOPoversight Put the Hammer down. Bring her back, and if she won't cooperate then charge her with Obstruction.
@DarrellIssa @gopoversight EXCELLENT!  FINALLY!  SANITY PREVAILS!!!!!  :-)
