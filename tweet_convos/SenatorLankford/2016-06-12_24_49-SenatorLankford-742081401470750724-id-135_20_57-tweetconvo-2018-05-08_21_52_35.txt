orlando's blood IS on your hands
if we know it all too well, shouldn't we make it harder for someone who's been on the TERRORIST WATCH LIST to get a gun
why doesn't your statement mention the word "gun"?
.@SenatorLankford Maybe try denying money from the NRA next time they offer. $10,000 bought your stance on this. No one is believing you.
Keep your prayers. Climb out of the @NRA's pocket and pass a law #lawsnotprayers
Will the $11k you took from the @NRA help you be more or less vigilant?
and yet you vote against a law to prevent gun violence?? That's a bit hypocritical if I do say so myself.
Where's the bill? @SenatorLankford #commonsenseguncontrol #EndGunViolence #ReinstateBradyBill
some gun control would be a better start
this is great an all but instead of only praying... why don't we do something about it.
thoughts and prayers mean nothing if you refuse to enact legislation that will protect our citizens.
Shame on you. You are your party are responsible for allowing this to continue to happen. Enjoy your blood money, you shill
were your prayers w/ the victims when you voted to allow the purchase of assault rifles by ppl on the terrorist watch list?
You have done nothing but make life harder for LGBT ppl and easier for killers. Your statement is a farce & so are you
You took $11K from NRA. What would it cost to buy your vote for sensible gun laws that would save lives? #gunsense
#BS
#BanAssaultWeapons 
Get Russia and the  NRA out of our elections!
#VoteThemOut
"we must continue to remain vigilant" yet you voted to block common sense gun laws? Align your actions with your words.
Correction: "At the hands of greedy gun manufacturers who fund @NRA and who buy politicians like you to enable gun deaths."
the nation needs your leadership & action.  Out of touch cliches offer nothing.  We'll be vigilant if you're not a coward.
prayers arent enough #EnoughIsEnough #NotOneMore #EndGunViolence stop taking NRA money
but you said nothing about the LGBT community which has been affected. What? Too Christian for you to acknowledge it?
"By their fruits you will know them." Thank you for the prayers, now please back them up with more gun regulations.
prayers = NOTHING.
when will GOP give up NRA and hate? GOP fuels the hatred.
#GOPYouOwnThis #NRABloodOnYourHands
still no mention of the LGBTQ community!!! i sure can't wait to vote for new politicians!!!
maybe address the problem with guns next mass shooting eh? Give it a couple days. I'm sure it'll happen again.
senseless? What's senseless is your vote to allow known terror suspects access to assault weapons.
.@SenatorLankford #OKLAHOMA VOTE THIS MAN OUT ASAP!
.@SenatorLankford you are a #MurderEnabler and the people are wise to your corruption #GunMoney #FollowTheMoney #VoteOutGuns #VoteOutGOP
your prayers are meaningless, taking into account that you've been paid by the NRA and therefore didn't mention guns here.
why do you hate trans children, then? @SenatorLankford
you take @NRA money and vote down #LGBT rights. Who exactly are you standing with today?
Dry your tears with some more NRA money. Empty thoughts and prayers won't keep this from happening again. #GunSense will.
since you have been such a staunch supporter of #lgbt rights, your tweet seems so sincere. #DeleteYourAccount
if we gave you more money than the NRA wld we get more than #thoghtsandprayers
Maybe while you're praying, you can ask God to forgive you for taking money from NRA, voting against LGBTQ legistlation.
he was able to buy a gun because of your votes This isn't your fault but u should have the courage to own that stance now
you don't care for real we know. We all see through the shit
Prayers aren't enough. What are you doing to stop this from happening again? The time for common-sense gun laws is now.
.@SenatorLankford
.@SenatorLankford The blood of these 50 young people is on your hands and the hands of those who accept NRA money and then vote for them.
.@SenatorLankford what are you going to do to help prevent the next massacre? Inaction is its own form of cowardice.
Wonder how much the NRA paid him... Also notice how he doesn't mention the word gun in his statement?
their blood is on your hands.  Stop being owned by the NRA and stand up for #gunsense
You support those victims being fired for their sexuality. Take your just for show statement & shove it up your ass.
elected officials like you are true cowards. Have the courage to act and protect your citizens.
the hate filled coward bought his murder weapons legally this week. You could help change that, but you take NRA money.
And therefore you are immediately going to stop taking NRA contributions, and support a ban on assault rifles, right?
no thanks you hypocritical #gunslut
A much better statement would be to actually enact legislation to prevent this from happening again.
OMG! I knew you'd be on this list of WINGNUTS! Stop taking NRA money and come up with a ban on assault weapons
my statement on you : shut up
"remain vigilant" = "sell more guns"
Psst! @SenatorLankford ! You forgot to mention LGBT and guns. #Do-over
God helps those who help themselves. Prayer is fine but you have to follow through with aggressive gun reform. #Amend2Now
.@SenatorLankford - How much has the #NRA given to your campaign again?
Didn't you vote against a bill that could have kept him from buying the gun? #Hypocrite
If only some legislative body had the power to pass laws restricting assault rifles! Oh wait! YOU DO. #BloodOnYourHands
You feel so bad for the victims, but you take money from the NRA? You helped cause the tragedy w/inaction.
you need to be voted out! Taking money from the NRA and watching this idiot get his guns legally!
.@SenatorLankford You're just as guilty for taking $ from the NRA & doing nothing to prevent this atrocity. I'm ashamed you represent me.
youâ€™re a coward for not mentioning that he purchased this gun legally; this still happened. Ready to vote you out of office
if you know the sting of this senseless violence why have you stood by and done nothing !?
Guns, guns, guns, guns, guns, guns, guns, guns, guns, more guns, more guns, more guns, more guns, cowardly politicians.
here we go with the fucking prayers again
He did that with a legally acquired military grade AR 15. He couldn't have done it without a gun. Say it. Stop another.
quit taking donations from @NRA then I'll be more inclined to believe your sincerity. Have some integrity dude.
Rational & responsible gun laws could have prevented this. In your failure to mention guns, your comment is weak sauce.
the atrocity is that politicians like u do nothing to prevent this. Remain vigilant?  Actions speak louder than words.
what are you doing to prevent this from happening here in Oklahoma?
103 people were shot with an assault weapon. Your prayers won't stop mass shootings. Do something. #gunsense #Orlando
all it took was $11.4k from the NRA to buy you.
you loser ban automatic weapons. Sorry NRA WONT GIVE U $$$anymore
Instead of praying, maybe you could try GOING to Orlando and DOING something? Donate blood, comfort families, donate money.
legal guns did this, you did this. You & your inaction did this. Was the NRA $ worth all the lives? #NRApaidforyourtweet
if you valued human lives more than @NRA money your #ThoughtsAndPrayers would not be hollow. Their blood is on your hands.
My thoughts and prayers to all @NRA owned politicians who have been inconvenienced by this tragedy.
@SenatorLankford
eat your prayers. The NRA owns you.
a hate-filled coward WITH A GUN. your hollow grief means nothing w/o the action you could be taking but are not.
The terrorist can be destroyed in three years! You need the right leaders in the right place. But for now pray.
How about DOING something to stop the carnage? #gunsense #stoptheNRA
Blood on your hands sir.
now that you've prayed are you going to follow through and take actions or just ignore this until it happens again?
Please spend less time praying and more time doing your job as a senator to pass laws that will protect our citizens.
Yet you and your @NRA purchased friends allow terrorists to buy assault rifles to kill us.

Keep your prayers and words.
As you cash your NRA paycheck, don't forget to look in the mirror and see, this is on you. Hypocrite
You know that you can both pray AND act so this doesn't happen again, right? You can start by refusing NRA $$$ from now on.
do something. Currently, their blood is on your hands.
And it will stay there as long as you & rest of @HouseGOP & @SenateGOP bend over for @NRA
if you don't help enact legislation then you are part of the problem #MassShooting #Guns #Orlando
#NRA puppet Congressmen could have prevented this, you allow terror watchlist suspect to buy guns
Do your job. Pass laws.
you have blood on your hands. We deserve better than you.
Massacred at the hands of someone with a legally acquired military grade weapon. Guns. Guns. Guns. Say it
you take money and let people get murdered. You take money. To get people killed.
If you want this stuff to stop, then pass some gun control laws and stop taking blood money from the NRA.
