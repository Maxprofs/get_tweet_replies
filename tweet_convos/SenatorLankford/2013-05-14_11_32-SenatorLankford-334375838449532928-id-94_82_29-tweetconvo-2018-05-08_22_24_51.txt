@SpeakerBoehner Really Mr. Speaker? Why are you wasting taxpayer dollars with that? The President will never approve repealing Obamacare #p2
@SpeakerBoehner when are you going to appoint a select committee on Benghazi?
@SpeakerBoehner It is so sad that in our country those with power will do anything to help insurance/pharma - YOU hurt people day after day

@SpeakerBoehner   You represent no one but yourselves.  When you say "save taxpayers dollars" you mean your and your cronies money!
@SpeakerBoehner  You and your cohorts have NO BUSINESS calling yourselves representatives of the residents of the US.
@SpeakerBoehner I hope all of you take a look at my two systems. They put Obama-Care to shame and mine help saves our economy!

@SpeakerBoehner Why don't you quit as speaker that would create taxpayer jobs and dollars. Bring the real speaker back Nancy Pelosi! LOSER
@SpeakerBoehner Again. and again. and again. and again......
@SpeakerBoehner How many wasted votes and wasted dollars will you spend on PPACA? It's the law of the land you have said so yourself.
@SpeakerBoehner Your 38th attempt is bordering on insanity given the Senate won't pass and @BarackObama will veto. #mostlikelytoobstruct
@SpeakerBoehner You fail to produce ONE solid Jobs bill. U attack Obamacare more than 38x. Weakest Speaker Ever.
@SpeakerBoehner I watched that movie 36 times before, ACA still is the law
@SpeakerBoehner Do you plan to do ANYTHING constructive during your speakership? Which hopefully will end soon?
@SpeakerBoehner Honestly...you GOPers are a waste of tax dollars.
@SpeakerBoehner How about gutting the weasels at the IRS, State Dept, and the DOJ!!! Start making them answer!!
