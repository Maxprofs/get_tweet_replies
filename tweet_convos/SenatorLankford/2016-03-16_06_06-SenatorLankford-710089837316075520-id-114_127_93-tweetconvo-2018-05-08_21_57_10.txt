@SenatorLankford Since you're up for reelection please refrain from all voting: we really should give the American people a voice #DoYourJob
@SenatorLankford @MikeCrapo That's a bunch of "Crapo" senator. Quit obstructing the constitution and do your job. #SCOTUS #MerrickGarland
@SenatorLankford @SenDanCoats Biden's actual point was to wait after the election, but still allow Bush to nominate http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2016/02/22/3752298/no-joe-biden-didnt-say-that-the-senate-should-block-supreme-court-nominees-during-an-election-year/ …
@SenatorLankford @SenatorBurr fine both parties  are guilty. Now do your job!!!
@SenatorLankford out of context: Biden also asked  Bush to nominate a moderate, in same speech.
@SenatorLankford So, what Dems do Repubs do? I don't understand what then makes you different?
@SenatorLankford @SenatorBurr  How did they get the Biden Rule ?
@SenatorLankford @ELM_LiveWire Is MSM disseminating this info. Probably not.
@SenatorLankford This is a logical fallacy: 2 rights don't make a wrong. U can't justify NOT DOING YOUR JOB 'cuz someone else once didn't.
@SenatorLankford #DoYourJob
.@SenatorLankford Two wrongs down make a right.
@SenatorLankford  what about Reagan  in 1988 State Union. I guess get liar liar pants on fire on set record straight
@SenatorLankford don't be infantile, does @GOP really just emulate the Democrats, or does it want to #dotheirjob #SCOTUSnominee
@SenatorLankford IDC who did it first...you need do what we sent you there to do!  Stop all this ridiculous nonsense #doyourjob
@senatorlankford AG Loretta Lynch: DOJ Not Required To Charge...
http://www.weaselzippers.us/260853-ag-loretta-lynch-doj-not-required-to-charge-hillary-clinton-even-if-fbi-recommends/ …
@CHIEF_CABIOCH @SenatorLankford @weaselzippers The GOP have really shown the american people. That they don't care. Stand up u guys!
@bluesmanfd1 @senatorlankford @weaselzippers do NOT paint ALL of US with the Same BRUSH, mcconnell, mccain, ryan is NOT the Entire party
@CHIEF_CABIOCH @Bluesmanfd1 @SenatorLankford @weaselzippers maybe u should post a list? Then we can ck into them all and make our desision?
@bluesmanfd1 @senatorlankford @weaselzippers to many names for 140 characters, but the Party will Swing back to the Far Right, or divide
@CHIEF_CABIOCH @SenatorLankford @weaselzippers Far rgt- but u want to spend tax dollars to change a piece of currency we've used for years.
@bluesmanfd1 @senatorlankford @weaselzippers what makes you think I want to Change any currency ?
@CHIEF_CABIOCH @SenatorLankford @weaselzippers Senator, u weren't for changing the face on the 10 or 20 dollar bill. On the tax payers back?
@SenatorLankford @InhofePress Please oppose the nomination of Judge Garland to protect our Second Amendment rights! Tyvm! Happy Easter
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs 
In 2008/2012 WE ppl elected Democratic POTUS& Repubs have been fucking w/him ever sense.  Give us Garland!
@SenatorLankford No tit for tat.  The nominee deserves a hearing and a vote. Vote yea or nay. Obstruction is not governance.
#DoYourJob
@SenatorLankford @SenDanCoats Fact:  8 years of obstruction and disrespect towards POTUS have destroyed the GOP. And you still don't get it.
@SenatorLankford @MikeCrapo Republicans have made it a POLITICAL point to never support @POTUS. Lankford's missive is absolute nonsense.
@SenatorLankford @SenatorBurr Doesn't really matter. You shouldn't expect to be paid if you don't do your job. #DoYourJobCongress
@SenatorLankford   Respect the President's Nominee 
  #DoYourJob #doyourjobcongress
@SenatorLankford @jiminhofe show everyone you are BETTER then them by NOT obstructing the process. Set a precedent of getting stuff DONE!
@SenatorLankford @SenatorBurr Biden and Reid were wrong then; you're wrong now. You have everybody's favorite nominee, so confirm him.
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs they already had a voice. Twice. They picked Obama. Do your constitutionally required job, Senator.
@SenatorLankford @SenDanCoats 
Supreme Court Nominees Considered in Election Years Are Usually Confirmed
.@SenatorLankford Another fact:  People won't re-elect you this November if you won't #DoYourJob
@SenatorLankford #DoYourJob stop making excuses for being a lazy worker
@SenatorLankford @SenatorBurr I am curious - do you work for McConnell or the people?
@SenatorLankford Fact: You are paid to #DoYourJob not play politics. I can't wait to vote against you.
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs But they still went through the process. Typical GOP misrepresentation.
@SenatorLankford @RepMullin  Setting the record straight requires including this:
@SenatorLankford #doyourjob No one cares who has done what in the past. Just fill the vacancy at #SCOTUS
@SenatorLankford @MikeCrapo @SenatorRisch
@SenatorLankford @MikeCrapo @SenatorRisch
@SenatorLankford @MikeCrapo @SenatorRisch
@SenatorLankford @MikeCrapo So if you are going to "set the record straight" then use ALL the facts, not your selective facts.
@SenatorLankford @MikeCrapo  AND it was the end of June when Biden said that, It was not February. Again, there was no opening-now there is.
@SenatorLankford @MikeCrapo FURTHERMORE, when Biden said that, there was no opening on the court. He said "should consider", not "we won't"
@SenatorLankford @MikeCrapo FACT: Despite what Joe Biden said, EVERY nominee got a hearing and EVERY nominee got a vote.
@SenatorLankford @MikeCrapo did the dems just talk about waiting on a #SCOTUS nominee? You know they didn't filibuster the hearing #asshole
@SenatorLankford DO YOUR JOB AND VET THIS NOMINEE WITHOUT PREJUDICE!  #DoYourJob

@SenatorLankford Give full consideration to Pres. Obama's nomination. Remember, you represent ALL Oklahomans.
@SenatorLankford POTUS did his constitutional duty, now you do yours! Yes, I'm an Okie! Confirm him!
@SenatorLankford @MikeCrapo Just do your constitutional duty. Put your politics aside. #SCOTUSnominee
@SenatorLankford FACT: Chief Judge Merrick Garland has more federal judicial experience than any #SCOTUSnominee in history.
@SenatorLankford @Senate_RPC Please don't ever confirm a pro-abortion murderer. Innocent blood on our nation's hands.
@SenatorLankford my views are as a moderate Republican that thinks it time we kick the Tea Party out of the GOP because they are RINO's
@SenatorLankford The republican party is dyeing and you and the clowns you hang out with made it possible. Have the hearings for SCOUS!
@SenatorLankford Congrats on being foolish. The hearing will happen now or in December because clowns like you made Trump and Cruz possiable
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs You need to go back to Kindergarten and brush up on the difference between right and wrong
@SenatorLankford @MikeCrapo Democrats and Republicans are both wrong to politicize a #SCOTUS nominee during the presidential year
@SenatorLankford But, sir, you work for us, not the Republican party and you should vote on this nomination.  You're causing more gridlock.
@SenatorLankford if true, this doesn't justify behavior. "They did it first!" Sounds like an elementary school playground to me. #DoYourJob
@SenatorLankford @RepMullin two wrongs don't make a right - didn't you learn that in Sunday school? Give the nominee an honest hearing.
@SenatorLankford @MikeCrapo #DoYourJob
@SenatorLankford Do your job.
@SenatorLankford  Do your job. Trump will not be the president, so Hillary or Bernie will most likely pick someone you like even less.
@SenatorLankford Yet, each time, the Senate held hearings. #DoYourJob and give Garland a hearing, please.
Hey @SenatorLankford @MikeCrapo Maybe you should just #DoYourJob #crapoindeed
@SenatorLankford This is the type of logical, nuanced argument you hear on a playground.
.@SenatorLankford @MikeCrapo But the Sen Dems DID hold hearings & allowed a vote didn't they? #DoYourJob
@SenatorLankford You've articulated something we all knew. Both parties have done wrong in the past. Shouldn't sway you today. #DoYourJob
@SenatorLankford @SenatorBurr I hope you guys will both #DoYourJob
@SenatorLankford you need to do your job and approve Merrick Garland for the SCOTUS, he helped put McVeigh away, we need justices like him
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs Two wrongs don't make a right!
@SenatorLankford GOP espouses the Constitution, so follow, when did Bides statement become a rule and replace Constitutional duty of Senate
@SenatorLankford Merrick deserves a hearing
@SenatorLankford Just do something 4 once, pls. Stop talking about and just fucking do it. Were tired of the TALK. Stop Obama.
@SenatorLankford BHO choice led investigation in OKC bombing. THIS Okie thinks some facts hidden. Unconvinced that John Doe 3 nonexistent.
@SenatorLankford You actually appear INFORMED.
@SenatorLankford Who cares if "they did it too". Grow up and do your damn job. This from a person who voted for @SenatorBurr yes'day #SCOTUS
@SenatorLankford Are you going to block Judge Garland who served this great state in our time of need? OKC Bombing.
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs @POTUS will whine,complain attack SO WHAT there would be so much anger if any1 gives in DELAY DELAY @CNN @AP
@SenatorLankford Did either block/delay the vote? If "yes", they're as bad as Repubes. If "no", this is a false analogy/comparison
@SenatorLankford   So the GOP defends its obstructionism with "Payback's a b*tch, ain't it?"
?!?!
#DoYourJob
@SenatorLankford @SenDanCoats
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs Nobody's saying Dems were right. Be better than the Dems and do your job honestly and in good faith.
@SenatorLankford @senthomtillis The "Mom, he did it first argument". Shouldn't responsible Senators do better?
@SenatorLankford yeah but did they actually block a vote? No
@SenatorLankford @SenatorBurr 2 wrongs make a right...
@SenatorLankford Do you differ on what they say vs. what is actually done? I mean politicians say many things, but actually blocking vote?
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs
Take @POTUS' moderate pick or face a bitter dem wave in Nov.
Lose @WhiteHouse, #Senate, & #SCOTUS
#StupidParty
@SenatorLankford Yes, both parties are guilty of obstructing presidential nominees. Wow! Can you get past juvenile behavior and do your job?
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs
How many election year appointees did Biden and Reid successfully block?
Cut the shit and do your job.
.@SenatorLankford #DoYourJob you've obstructed everything @POTUS did for the last 7yrs! We're done w this do nothing senate #SCOTUSnominee
@SenatorLankford
BUT THEY DIDN'T!
Rs will obstruct.
.@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs 
more like "While @POTUS is doing his job,  I'm not doing mine."
@SenatorLankford @jiminhofe Fact:  Biden in the same speech said he would support and vote to confirm a moderate appointment.
@SenatorLankford @jiminhofe So yours is a lie of omission.
@SenatorLankford @jiminhofe Fact: Only you Republicans have refused to even consider a SC nominee. It's unprecedented.
@SenatorLankford @jiminhofe Fact: You have scored politically for seven years appealing to your racist base by opposing everything @POTUS
@SenatorLankford @jiminhofe @POTUS has proposed.
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs 
@senatorlankford this Potus isnt the real thing, and both houses of Congress will be held accountable for not Pursuing his impeachment
@CHIEF_CABIOCH @SenatorLankford A lot of people should pay for what they have done in colluding with this criminal administration MADE2PAY!
@scgunner @senatorlankford many in the ruling class paid, google mussolini and his girl friends death at the hands of the people
@scgunner @senatorlankford his own mother couldnt recognize him
@senatorlankford The House and Senate need to begin Impeachment on loretta lynch for saying the DOJ isnt required to prosecute hillary
