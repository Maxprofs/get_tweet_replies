@pambesteder @SpeakerBoehner Pam no we the people are not happy. We expect the House to pass sooner or latter a clean CR is the right action
@PastorJJFT @SpeakerBoehner What we EXPECT is the Senate to finally pass a REAL BUDGET so these CRs don't have to go into effect, right?
Whatever! Do the right thing-for once!  Rt “@SpeakerBoehner: House votes today to keep govt open, protect troops, delay #ObamaCare 1 year”
