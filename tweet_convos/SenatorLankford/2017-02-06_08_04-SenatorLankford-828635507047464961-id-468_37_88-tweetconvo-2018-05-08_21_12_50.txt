except for Elizabeth Warren!  
I am one of your constituents, and I’m appalled that you didn’t extend this consideration to @SenWarren. #ShePersisted
You should take your own advice.
tell that to @SenWarren
Like Senator Warren was allowed to?
except for @SenWarren. What a hypocrite
ignored all calls, sent condescending form letters, fawn over Trump deplorables U sir are in the basket
Except for Elizabeth Warren, right?
.@SenatorLankford @washingtonpost and they should pay taxes like everybody else, too!
Is this your defense for 45 to use his office to enrich his family? #nordstrom #ivanka #@OfficeGovEthics
So... which Sen. Langford are you?  The hypocrite or the liar?
wrong. Mosques too? You are an Easy D.
everyone should be allowed to speak? Is that why you voted to silence Warren. If you are tax exempt, no endorsements #logic
In the case of churches, not if they don't pay taxes. Also, how'd you vote on the @SenWarren thing?
ok, no problem as long as u revoke their tax exempt status
Yet you support an administration that tries to discredit free press and fires people who disagree.pathetic
free press required to report facts
They do and if you cannot identify facts when you see them, YOU are the problem.
which press r u referring to??
And yet you voted to silence @SenWarren.
you have lost all credibility. Your hypocrisy is amazing!
even @SenWarren
Shut up.
I'll trade you the tax exempt status every church gets automatically with less work than every other 401c.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 

Hypocrite
Seems to b new lie and more hypocrisy every day in that White House. I can't believe it.
unless it's Senator Warren or something that you don't agree with or want to hear, right?
unless you're a woman senator amirite?!
uisrite
Agreed Senator, all TAXPAYING INDIVIDUALS should be able to voice their opinions
Hope the rioters are filing their returns by April 15.
we're still waiting for our w2s from Soros 

Then federal employees should be allowed to do this as well.....
What about @elizabethforma ?
Except if they are a woman whose job is senator.
You are a shining example of hypocrisy.  How do say that crap w/ a straight face?
Elizabeth Warren is an American and you voted to NOT allow her to speak freely. HYPOCRITE!
You voted to silence @SenWarren, you hypocrite.   Is hypocrisy a requirement for membership in the @gop?
um.....hypocrite much??
I want you and your the rest of Senate to create a law that gets rid of Citizens United.
I disagree. The constitution says separation of church and state. Uphold it, pls.
Unless you're a Republican who wants to silence dissent. Not then. Worm. #ShePersisted
Except Elizabeth Warren.  Right?
So why did you vote to stop @SenWarren from Speaking Freely- One of your Alternative Facts or just hypocrisy
shut up
What about when it's a woman reading a relevant letter about a political appointee's history of racism?
Exactly. That includes Hollywood "elitists."
the world is watching and taking note. we will never forget what garbage you are.
If they're white men you mean. You certainly didn't feel that way when you voted against Warren
Why doesn't that apply to Senator Warren? That's hypocritical.
.@SenatorLankford except Senator Warren...she doesn't get to speak. Right? #shame
EXCEPT FOR @SenWarren ! "She Was Warned.She was Given an Explanation.Nevertheless,she persisted." SHE SPOKE FOR ME.U didn't
. @SenatorLankford Can you say Hypocrite?
Aww did Pocahontas lose a feather?
Separation of church and state! Your religious beliefs do NOT apply to all of us.
Seriously? Except on the Senate floor, huh?
HAHAHAHA you fucking dickbag idiot.
How'd you feel silencing a fellow senator yesterday?
Shame on YOU @SenatorLankford Shame on @GOP  Shame on @MitchMcConell You pieces of S€%T will answer for your HYPOCRACY.
Really? Tell us more ...
you silenced a US Senator last night, you dope.
I would like to call a vote for you to shut up and sit down.
Hypocrite
@bayofarizona @washingtonpost sure but they should not be tax exempt. Can't have it both ways Senator.
If only you meant that hypocrite. #letlizspeak
does this include @SenWarren? Also, companies/organizations are not individuals!
Besides the fact that you're trampling on Church/State here, you voted less than 24 hrs ago to silence Ms. Warren.
interesting. didnt you vote to deny warrens today?
Organizations are not people. Every person in those groups already have right to free speech!
Except if they're brown, a lady, or not a Christian... if they want political speech, they can pay taxes
Even @SenWarren ??
every American excluding Elizabeth Warren
LOLOL, somehow hypocrisy isn't a strong enough word. As long as those words agree with your views, right?
Jesus Christ, what kind of balls must it take to tweet that after YOU voted to shut her up? #letlizspeak
let's all appreciate the irony in this stataement
is there such a thing as SUPER hypocrite? If it were in the dictionary, it would have your picture beside it. #letlizspeak
mind-boggling hypocrisy
wow. Except women? And specifically female senator? Hypocrisy reigns #letlizspeak #ShePersisted
excuse me @SenatorLankford but are you fucking kidding
These are the 49 Senators who just voted to silence Elizabeth Warren for QUOTING CORETTA SCOTT KING http://thkpr.gs/d000a470c6b4  
didn't you vote to silence a senator last night? We are seeing the hypocrisy front and center.
Tax the churches and businesses owned by the churches.
He's exactly right. & we are going to speak freely & often. Republicans up for reelection be prepared
Everybody? How about Sen. Liz Warren? Didn't you just VOTE to shut her up? What about Coretta Scott King?
Like...maybe...@elizabethforma or...you know...your constituents who have been calling you EVERY DAY?
except @elizabethforma ?
.@SenatorLankford @washingtonpost They can. It's called the 1st Amendmnt; same 1 that prohibits you from creating laws favoring one religion
As private citizens, we all can. As representatives of govt or a tax-exempt org, not necessarily. And that's a good thing.
.@SenatorLankford @washingtonpost ....except Elizabeth Warren, right Senator?

You voted to shut her right up, did you not?

GFY
But if you're so pro-free speech, @SenatorLankford, why did you vote to censure Elizabeth Warren last night?  @washingtonpost  2/
Hypocrites, every last republican.
Elizabeth Warren?
.@SenatorLankford @washingtonpost American individuals CAN speak their minds. Tax-exempt American religious institutions should not.  1/
Unless you're a woman senator, right??
.@SenatorLankford everyone that agrees with you. Fixed it for you
you kicked out senator warren yesterday. You are a disgrace to OK and still have never voted for you.
Just as long as they don't tell the truth about a shithead colleague of yours, right?
keep working at it, one day youll do something as silly as @jiminhofe and his snowball on the senate floor.
except for Liz Warren and by extension Corretta Scott King
why did you silence @SenWarren then?
Except Senator Warren? Oooops
except @SenWarren right?
You allow Trump to fire Sally Yates, who was defending the due process of law, and silence Sen. Warren for reading history.
Isn't E.Warren an American?Was it because she's a woman?Or she wanted to say things you didn't want to hear
hypocrite
What about @SenWarren?  You voted to silence her on the Senate floor last night. #ShePersisted #letlizspeak
hypocrisy is right at home in the GOP
So you were part of the 43 to #letlizspeak not the 49 to silence her?
Woke up on the hypocritical side of the bed today, did we, @SenatorLankford? #letlizspeak @washingtonpost
Everyone except @SenWarren, right?
And yet you voted to silence Sen. Warren - hypocrite!
And yet you voted to keep @SenWarren from speaking last night?
SHAME.
could you please help me correlate this to your vote to prevent @SenWarren from speaking on the floor?
Except Senator Warren, right? Hypocrite.
hypocrite
So you're gonna be okey dokey with synagogues and mosques supporting candidates? #right
Looking at the kind of person you are now.. I'm getting a real "Hitler's Youth" vibe from all those Falls Creek kids
Apparently everyone except Sen. Warren. Hypocrite! #letlizspeak
.@SenatorLankford @washingtonpost Wait. What?  Didn't you just vote to silence Senator Warren?  How many days do you stand by your tweets?
you are a ridiculous hypocrite, sir. And my guess is that you know it too.
then why should they be tax-exempt?
Um, @SenWarren didn’t get that last night. Practice what you preach. Also, grow a spine.
And yet you voted to silence Elizabeth Warren, jackass.
you must mean everyone who agrees with you has the right to speak freely. Certainly not Your fellow Senator Warren!
Hypocrisy, thy name be Lankford.
As long as they're white and rich right?
In that case, every American should pay taxes. Is that what you are trying to argue?
"intimidate and chill the free exercise of the ballot by citizens" #hypocrisy #fraud
unless it's a woman, having the balls to read the words of another woman against a white man. Shame on you #ShePersisted
except sitting Senators with whom you cravenly disagree?
hypocrite
including Senator Warren .. your party's efforts to silence her backfired. BIGLY. We won't be silenced.
Unless it's Elizabeth Warren, right?
you're a hypocrite. #byefelicia #letlizspeak
hey look, another hypocrite
Except @SenatorWarren ?
unless they are a woman and a democrat revealing racist leanings of cabinet member, right Senator?
Tell that to @elizabethforma
Except Sen. Warren?
you represent my parents in OKC; we don't approve of you voting to silence two great women's voices, Warren and King.
And yet you gag @SenWarren. #shameless #hypocrisy #wearewatching
Except senators talking about cabinet nominees, obviously. #GOP #Pharisees
Everyone except @SenWarren that is. You're one more politic. whose morals can be sold to the highest bidder
Except Elizabeth Warren.
So why did you silence @SenWarren, Lankford?
.@SenatorLankford Didn't you vote to rebuke @SenWarren last night? Seems like your free speech convictions are fair weather ones.
unless they're a U.S. Senator of course. #ShePersists
except for the ladies, right? We should just keep our mouths shut forever.
unless you're an educated white woman speaking out against racism & violence against women@elizabethforma
unless you're Elizabeth Warren speaking the truth you don't want to hear. Try some consistency Senator.
Unless they are READING FROM THE RECORD ON THE SENATE FLOOR.
What's that name...Warren something...
unless they say something you don't like, like Sen. Warren?
the. Why did you vote to silence @SenWarren last night? ???
unless you are @SenWarren, right? you are less convinced of this if the speaker is female or democrat, no?
@CongressmanHice weird how YOU voted to suppress Elizabeth Warren and Coretta Scott King's voice bc you didn't like it
Now you're just trolling Senator. #letlizspeak
Even @SenWarren? Especially @SenWarren. But I guess that's how  @GOP rolls—
And what was your voter last night for shutting down Sen. Warren...you are a hypocrite.
So why vote against letting Elizabeth Warren speak in a debate about a cabinet nominee? #ShePersists
Are you this ignorant or this corrupt? You have no business in government.
Including @SenatorWarren, right?
Except @SenWarren, right?
As long as they agree with your position right? @elizabethforma is the best.
*Unless you're a woman.

Why wouldn't you let Elizabeth Warren speak then? Hypocrite much?
Unless you're reading a ltr from Coretta Scott King opposing Sessions that Strohm Thurmond refused to put in Senate record
except for Elizabeth Warren lol you people are such hypocrites
do you extend the same courtesy to @SenWarren?
This isn't about convictions, it's breaking church state separation you KKK shill.
But you voted to silence @elizabethforma from speaking hers on the Senate floor. Hypocrite.
then they should also pay taxes.
Everyone, except Liz Warren?
as long as it's not Elizabeth Warren, right?
but not if your Elizabeth Warren? If you believe this why did you vote to silence her? The people are aware
Every American does have the individual right to take sides.
what a hypocrite.
how do you muster up the level of hypocrisy needed to send this tweet?  It's impressive in a shameless sort of way
except when it comes to a women pointing out racism from your fellow reps, right? Hypocrite.
You voted to silence @SenWarren last night, you hypocrite!
definitely strange you wouldn't let Elizabeth Warren speak then
Definitely gonna budget to give to your opponent when u run again. Hypocrite.  #LetHerSpeak
including senators from MA?
it's the tax status, not the free speech. But I think you know that, don't you?  You just don't want to grapple with it.
