We have a senator who talks about emojis, but won't address security clearance for #Kushner or respond directly to voters? #TrumpRussia
Feel a bit sorry for you guys.
Same here. Leftists are very negative people. They can't find enjoyment in anything.
Some are just very low-life people who have no other goals and aspirations but to sit and complain. It's sad to watch this happen to them
Not exactly. But you're cool w/ a senator using taxpayer money to tweet about emojis? Well, I guess if it's your sen, then rejoice!
@MorganneToal

Stefanie has basically started petition to bring back ginger emojis lmao
Zombie, ginger. Neither have a soul. Call it even, Senator. #onlykidding
But they have one that represents your party
... 
Dude, I'm a knitter and we're still waiting on a ball of yarn or some knitting needles. Sheesh. :D
Redhead knitter and everyone's happy?
We can get an @GOP majority @SenateGOP & @HouseGOP but we can't get Obamacare repealed and replaced. @charliekirk11 @FoxNews

@ssierra_rose @ummpaige Oklahoma has you guys covered


Something funny about a society that under-funds the very country & people you are spending trillions to "defend."
Senator, have you started drinking, by chance? Your last couple of tweets seem pretty loose & out of character for you. You okay?
Why can you tweet about emojis but can't meet with your constituents about losing their healthcare?
Pretty sure this one's a better fit anyway.  
I guess all men should just be happy they still have hair. :-)
Hello, while you're on here tweeting about emojis, I would like to keep my healthcare, please. Thanks!
Regardless of his politics, he's right. There needs to be ginger emoji. @Apple

Where's the #werewolf love too? 
#WorldEmojiDay
Really? This is what matters to you? 
Start supporting the President and do your job.
Help another ginger out and follow me
Who cares about your stupid emojis, do you actually have any work to do
I assumed you were a zombie.
Your party has abandoned any pretense of American values. Stand up to them like a real senator.
Lankford, if you vote for this horrible health plan I will personally do everything I can to campaign for your removal from office!
@AppleSupport We damand res head emojis now!!!
Who gives a fuck
100% agree!! Demand the !!
Priorities Senator.  Focus on doing your job for America instead of inane things like this.
Yeah and what about the hijabi girl
Give us single payer Medicare for All health care and we'll get you all the redhead emojis you like @SenatorLankford.
How about a, "the president is a traitor emoji"?
@Heritage @HouseGOP to "derail" the TRUMPCARE bill. i vote no to this proposal. REPBULICAN.
world emoji day? are senators and leaders making up "fake" holidays to get likes. @Heritage @HouseGOP . at this moment, rallies are outside
@williamjday #firstworldproblems 
Couldn't agree more #gingerproblems
fat check to do nothing! That's ok tho, just keep playing with emojis because 2018 is closing in fast & 2020 not far from that.
Sounds like you're getting bored with your job! When are you going to take care of the problems in the White House? Must be nice to draw a
Your mentions right now must be a laundry list of folks without a sense of humor
#replaceSenatorLankford
Because us gingers are an evil sort. How do you make an emoji that steals souls?
What's the point? Globalists are working their hardest to make redheads extinct. Not surprised that redheaded emoji would be "problematic."
As one of your constituents, I would hope you have other things to do with your time than make jokes about emojis. Oklahoma deserves better.
Please dont let susan rice off the hook!
I don't see a difference
@MurawskiCM snap snap
@kellyyannee
he understands
 got your back!
#whereisthework #senatestinks #moretoworryabout

As a natural strawberry blonde (ginger light?) who's felt pressure to go brunette often, I feel this pain.
It's because redheads have no souls.


Where is healthcare for all?
Seriously @SenatorLankford? #GetToWork on getting rid of filibuster & #RepealNow & #TaxReform Then your staff can play w/emojis
#PumpkinPoundersUnite
Hell, I just want a bald guy emoji.
You can propose any new emoji you'd like to the unicode governing body: http://unicode.org/emoji/selection.html â€¦

Be the change you want to see in the world!
A ginger man emoji embedded with your voice.
It's bc you're the worst. #DoYourJob 
#GOPConspiracy #GOPCoverUp #AmericaWasNeverForSale
I am fairly sure being a red head is now considered a pre-existing condition, and you should be dropped from your health care.  #noAHCA
Way more important than equal health care for all, am I right? Or even the fact that 45 and his family colluded with Russia. #priorities
You do realize that the Russian story has been proved to be fake right?  How do you idiots still believe it. Sad!
I'm still waiting on the black family...guess we all have an emoji dream#worldemojiday
Oklahoma definitely has a #GingerProblem. 
Don't @ me, my mama was a ginger and a woman of integrity. She also did FT ministry and never mocked it as a political endeavor.
As my Sen for OKLAHOMA, there are more priority to tweet about. 
Well Mary Jo I think there's a lot of deflection going on. That's what's up!
My baby girl is trending red head beauty.  We need those emojis!
@SenatorLankford I would emoji you any day !!
#redfox 

I'm so glad you are worried about emojis today... not like we have anything else going on...
If he tweets about it, he needs to skip.
Try to be cool on your personal acct. Use this one for good news, like the return of the #freemarket to #healthcare
K B.  Where do you get your healthcare from?
If you can get Price Harry to retweet that, I'm sure you would get enough momentum for a redhead emoji to be added
