@LeoShane WHENEVER THAT DAY COMES WHEN WE AMERICANS GET BACK THE W.H., 1ST WE NEED TO OUTLAW LIBERALISM AS A TREASONOUS ACT...........
@LeoShane why did it even get barricaded? That was unnecessary and just seems punitive to American citizens
@LeoShane giving 'em hell one more time! #WeThePeople
@LeoShane my book release,available in amazon, barnes&nobel and ebook store." A Little Girl in a Big Hat" by Erlinda Jean
@LeoShane Way to go!  They need to do that at the White House and Congress.
@LeoShane @starsandstripes yea!!! I worried all day!!!!
@LeoShane Is there any place where we find without raising voice or fight is possible to get easily. Is civilization needs fight everywhere
@LeoShane without preparing society to develop human resource according to their ability how civilization will create a space respect all
@LeoShane @rogXue don't think you're really allowed to stop guys visiting a memorial when they're the reason ppl are free to have built it
@craggylotus exactly but sadly with the gov shut down they were probably supposed to try, wrong or not.
@LeoShane Congrats on your 500★ tweet! http://favstar.fm/t/385066540619423744 …
Favorite. MT “@LeoShane: Honor flight vets just knocked over the barriers at the WWII memorial to get inside ”
@LeoShane @Strikefest fuck this were going on some rides #griswalds. Gonna enjoy that vacation bitch.
@LeoShane @WillieGeist I think this is just the beginning.  People are fed up.
@LeoShane @KVOA You go. This trip was probably long in planning. It will probably be the last chance for most. Thank You.
@LeoShane They've earned it. They can walk through there any day of the week.
@LeoShane
@LeoShane Never could they have imagined they would have to battle Washington bureucrats when they landed on beaches in the 40's.
@LeoShane Civil disobedience.
@LeoShane These guys beat the Nazis and the Japanese.  I don't think they're going to let a few barricades stand in their way.
So cool. MT“@LeoShane: Honor flight vets just knocked over the barriers at the WWII memorial  #shutdown or no. ”
@skiplacombe I'm sure my WWII vet dad, God rest his soul, would have joined in tearing down those barriers.
@LeoShane Ha! These guys stormed the beaches at Normandy. Think a silly barricade will keep them out?
@LeoShane Someone has to lead. What is a barrier? after being in a War?
@LeoShane Didn't really think a measly barrier would stop guys who stormed beaches under gunfire!
@LeoShane When you say "knocked over," what does that mean exactly? Could you describe more?
.@aaronmedwards @LeoShane The barricades were no more "knocked over" than my aunt Tillie.
@LeoShane @jreineron7 - should have these guys march on congress!
@Pauliwallnutz @LeoShane @jreineron7 That's an excellent idea! I'd like to see the House try to turn them away
Yeah the white house.... @TheresaSchroe14 @Pauliwallnutz @LeoShane @jreineron7
@LeoShane It's time to show the feds where THEIR paycheck comes from. Let the shut down continue.
@LeoShane we have to realize no ill treatment of vets is new and it is not about to change POW-MIA national day of recognition was ignored
@LeoShane So now I'm hearing this was a staged political event. Say it ain't so?
Go Vets! @LeoShane: Honor flight vets just knocked over the barriers at the WWII memorial to get inside,
@RepLankford @LeoShane despite your best efforts to lock them out with your Government shutdown.
@LeoShane @TheMeyersGroup 
Piss off the Vets
Piss off the military
You no longer govern
@LeoShane This story made me smile. Good for them.
@LeoShane @WillieGeist Good!  People forget -- the American people own the government, not the other way around.
@LeoShane Vet POWER! Southern boys finally do take Washington!! I wish Shelby Foote had lived to see it.
@LeoShane Good!  The memorials belong to the TAXPAYERS not overpaid worthless gov't employees.
“@LeoShane: Honor flight vets just knocked over the barriers at the WWII memorial to get inside, #shutdown or no. ”
@LeoShane Come on!! No wimpy plastic barriers will stop WWII vets from an Honor Flight from visiting the WWII Memorial! These are real men!
@LeoShane @RaymondArroyo     Bravo to the vets!
@LeoShane @MontanaGear that's freaking fantastic
@LeoShane Going to DC for a student leadership conference this week, and with everything closed I was so sad, but these guys are my heroes.

@LeoShane Outstanding!
@LeoShane @jaketapper Feds don't own that memorial. They just mow it for those men.
@LeoShane @RepLankford The Greatest Generation, showing us how they won the war by knocking down obstacles for freedom!
@LeoShane Thank God for them. We need more like these heroes today. We do have them, but they are fighting to allow us to speak our mind.
@LeoShane These guys took the beach at Normandy.  The park police are no match.
@LeoShane awesome!
@LeoShane @CV_People Look at those extremists!
@LeoShane don't mess with the greatest generation of warriors ever, right?
@LeoShane if anyone deserves to visit that memorial, it is those vets.   this American proudly supports them.
@LeoShane My Dad is a WW2 Bravo!!!!!!!
Awesome! “@LeoShane: Honor flight vets just knocked over the barriers at the WWII memorial to get inside, #shutdown ”

“@LeoShane: Honor flight vets just knocked over the barriers at the WWII memorial to get inside, #shutdown or no. ”
@LeoShane @lanekimble awesome! My guys totally would have done that- I got to go with and cover an honor flight trip two weeks ago.
@LeoShane @BuzzFeedNews God bless 'em!!!
@LeoShane American Patriotism at it's best. God bless them all.
@LeoShane I wanna get this straight: that memorial looks like a pretty open space…and the #govshutdown requires it to be barricaded?
@LeoShane @SSgt93 good for them. Wish I was there to help them

RT @LeoShane: Honor flight vets just knocked over the barriers at the WWII memorial to get inside, #shutdown or no.
@LeoShane as they should. Maybe Congress needs to take a deeper look at the bravery of these vets and open their eyes to see the light.
Storm the Hill next! RT @LeoShane: vets just knocked over barriers at WWII memorial to get inside, #shutdown or no.
@LeoShane @DayKadence When do they storm congress ?
