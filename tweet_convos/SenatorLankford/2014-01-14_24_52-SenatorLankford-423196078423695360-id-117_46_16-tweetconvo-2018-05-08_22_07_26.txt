@SpeakerBoehner Unprepared GOP congress members is the Problem. DUE NOTHING CONGRESS! GOP STUCK ON STUPID!
@SpeakerBoehner Then why won't you have a special investigation on Benghazi?  What do you know & when did you know it????
@SpeakerBoehner Yet more ridiculous efforts to make a scandal out if a tragedy. Let's talk about you supporting a war based on a lie.
@SpeakerBoehner You need to start using both sides of brain maybe you could stop the continuous lies.  Use your ACA benefits 2 seek help.
.@SpeakerBoehner I thought the President asked Congress for additional funding for security, but Congress denied it.
@SpeakerBoehner sounds right what with you and ur #teabag brats cutting embassy funding? #tcot morons #gop crooks
@SpeakerBoehner Flat out lies, if you want to place blame, try looking at your republican run house!!! You cut funding for the State Dept.
@SpeakerBoehner  So tell us what you would have put in place to prevent this.
@SpeakerBoehner Where Was The GOP On This 60 Dead On Bushes Watch & YOU Said Nothing !! Fake Scandals Thats All GOP
@SpeakerBoehner YOU Cut Funding For Security. Stop Lying & Deflecting On False Scandals!! Where Are The JOBS GOP?
@SpeakerBoehner Maybe if the #GOP hadn't cut #Security #funds from the State Department budget, then you wouldn't be crying now. #GOPFail
@SpeakerBoehner more importantly, Obama was very well prepared for  today 's Miami Heat presser
@SpeakerBoehner Woefully? Or Intentionally? (Al Qaeda is on the run) BTW, fulfill your promise and pass the retired veterans bill.
@SpeakerBoehner MLK, Jr. was right "Nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity."
@SpeakerBoehner No shit! Who gave the stand down order and when???

@SpeakerBoehner how about a select committee?????
@SpeakerBoehner Republicans need to keep pursuing answers about #Benghazi. There needs to be an accounting!
@SpeakerBoehner when will Congress get to the bottom of the #Benghazi scandal? #obama is simply running out the clock!
@SpeakerBoehner maybe the congressional cut backs and off sets were the cause. Tea party morons
@SpeakerBoehner #KeepYourPromise
@SpeakerBoehner And you have been unprepared to govern
@SpeakerBoehner Why don't you people get off this dead horse and start fixing the roads in Ohio.
@SpeakerBoehner  So what now? With all the time and expense associated in getting answers on record, is there a conclusion? Do things change
@SpeakerBoehner any report from Fox News is unacceptable since they have proven unreliable
@SpeakerBoehner u truly stupid & have live in lying bubble of teabaggers 2 long. What about 4,000+ AM died due 2 GOPs WMD lies. Dumb Dumb
@SpeakerBoehner The GOP is just as unprepared to do anything about it. In the end, you'll make some speeches and go back on vacation.
@SpeakerBoehner Benghazi is so important to Republicans, they cut $224M from Embassy Security in new spending bill. http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/01/14/1269572/--1-trillion-omnibus-spending-bill-nbsp-unveiled?showAll=yes …
@SpeakerBoehner Good point Mr. Speaker. Your House cut embassy security funding. Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
@SpeakerBoehner unprepared, unresponsive, unqualified, unreliable, untrustworthy, understanding,  unsure,  unbelievable
@SpeakerBoehner sort of like bush was woefully. Unprepared for 9/11, totally the same right?
@SpeakerBoehner so was Bush.
@SpeakerBoehner if you are so worried about #Benghazi atttack, why did you vote to cut foreign embassy security budget? #bloodisonYOURhands
@SpeakerBoehner oh my god... do any of you people have any integrity at all? Look at what you have done to our great country. shame on you.
@SpeakerBoehner Why Hillary knew a threat existed for months. What happened to the 3 branches of government?
@SpeakerBoehner Bwaahaaaahaaaa!!!  U just can't stand it can you!  Why don't you and Issa get married.  You're perfect idiots for each other
@SpeakerBoehner So where is the select investigation? Your words have no action behind them. "Why does it matter!"
@SpeakerBoehner So the GOP follow up is to cut the security budget for embassies?  Great job keeping Americans safe you drunken stumble bum
@SpeakerBoehner broken record.. we know this and heard this. what did you do or say to help protect the consulate?
@SpeakerBoehner no way!
@SpeakerBoehner And what will Congress do about it? @DarrellIssa @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul @foxnewspolitics Enough pussy footing around!
@SpeakerBoehner u r the least productive speaker ever. You ought to be ashamed.
@SpeakerBoehner Where was your outrage when the 97 people were killed at embassies under the Bush Presidency?  #EnoughAlready
@SpeakerBoehner <------either call for a select committee to investigate or stuff a sock in it, ok. #Benghazi
@SpeakerBoehner the did nothing...on purpose. Stop being a democrat supporter. Keep in mind which party elected you.
@SpeakerBoehner Ambassador Steven's familly is not happy with the House GOP using their son as political cannon fodder. Shameful.
@SpeakerBoehner And that would be because your Congress would not give them the funding needed for their security! @cspan #edshow
@SpeakerBoehner @RepLankford Duh? Special Commission to Prosecute! Not Rocket Science.
@light4c @SpeakerBoehner @RepLankford Speaker will not do it makes you wonder why?
@SpeakerBoehner Then start impeachment proceedings. What the hell are you waiting for?
@SpeakerBoehner 9/11
@SpeakerBoehner They have always been woefully unprepared. Why not try doing something to get rid of them all?
@SpeakerBoehner I would have much more respect for you if you increased your vocabulary to include, compromise, immigration reform etc
@SpeakerBoehner and continues to distract and lie about it. #Disgraceful #Horrific #UnAmerican
@SpeakerBoehner The redacted material seems to exceed the already reported remainder
