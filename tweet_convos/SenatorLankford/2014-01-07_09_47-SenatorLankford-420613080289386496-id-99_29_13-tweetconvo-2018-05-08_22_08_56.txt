@YoungGOPGums @jasychic @SpeakerBoehner ah...poor babies.  Can I have your job?
@Maggyw519 @jasychic @SpeakerBoehner Do you know how hard it is to work 111 days/ yr. and spend most of those days dialing for dollars?
@YoungGOPGums @Maggyw519 @jasychic @SpeakerBoehner  / How about we only pay you for your day working in DC?  Who says you have to make 174t.
