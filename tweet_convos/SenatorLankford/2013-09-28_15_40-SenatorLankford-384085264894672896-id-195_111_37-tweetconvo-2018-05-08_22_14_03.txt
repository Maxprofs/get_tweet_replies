@SpeakerBoehner @politico You are one slimy snake. IMHO it's time for you to retire so you can vote for what's good for AMERICA, not #GOP.
@bulldawgs75 They make decent $ but Health ins. 3 yrs ago more than DOUBLED(1200/m)! Had 2 let it go. Now, they'll get affordable coverage.
@ladybigmac @bulldawgs75 Glad I can help pay for their insurance now too. Thanks.
@Subasescrum @ladybigmac @bulldawgs75 It sounds to me like you don't have a clue how insurance works!
@LibAthe80 @ladybigmac @bulldawgs75 I understand it well enough when people are voting freebies for themselves.
@Subasescrum @bulldawgs75 If you have ins. you're in a pool. It's not just your money covering you & avg. of $1000/yr goes 2 pay4 uninsured
