@ThomTillis Good to know, thank you.
Trump shouldn't be allowed to choose a justice in the last year of his presidency.
You must be a lib
Senator this nomination was STOLEN! This is not fair and unconstitutional. This is Obama's nomination..
@ThomTillis that would be awesome if Democrats weren't practicing their "Refudiate" skill sets. Acting like a TREE
@ThomTillis No on Devos!
Whoopdeedoo. Lets look at your voting record for 11 years ago. Winds have changed and this was for circuit court not SCOTUS
@ThomTillis we don't care. Stolen seat. #Gorsuch gets #45years on bench and is #antichoice #NO.
that was BEFORE he ruled in a bigoted assholey way.. he WILL be held accountable.  FFS sit down.
Hey I oppose him too but itâ€™s weird that Obama/Biden/etc said yes to him
yes..  BEFORE his colors showed.. it happens a lot.  It's what he has done since that matters & it aint pretty
True that was 11 yrs ago.  He would only have been late 30s.
Neil Gorsuch's qualifications are moot. Confirmation hearings should be held for Merrick Garland.
isn't he friends w/Trump sister? That is the only qualification he needs to be the BEST JUDGE! 
No, Hardiman is a friend of Trump's sister. Gorsuch went to law school with Obama. The legal world seems small.
thank you! I couldn't remember which! Appreciate the info!
Oddly, Trump's sister is a fairly liberal judge.
#Trump was a democrat & much more liberal before he decided to run for office, so I'm not surprised! #SCOTUS #Resist
~11 years ago for circuit court, not SCOTUS. Has Gorsuch made any judicial decisions in those years (i.e., Hobby Lobby)?
AND GOP Sens John McCain, Orrin Hatch, Susan Collins, & Jim Inhofe all voted yes on Mer. Garland's fed appointment-Ur pt?
Well, that was B4 @SenateMajLdr & @SpeakerRyan blocked EVERYTHING for 8 years. Try again. #NoGarlandNoGorsuch
@ThomTillis that was a decade ago.
I will significantly support your opponent financially in the next election  should you support #devos #DeVosvote Vote NAY
@ThomTillis NOTEWORTHY: Merrick Garland had support from senate republicans. What's your point?
@ThomTillis Your point? 1 might be ok for 1 job but not necessarily worthy of #SCOTUS. R all 175+ Ct Appeals judges worthy?
@ThomTillis isn't it great when people care less about party lines than what's right for our country? For our children?
@ThomTillis ok we will see, he seems like a proper candidate meanwhile, NO DEVOS!
So was Merrick Garland...w/ support from republicans.
garland was anti gun rights. Could never have gotten enough votes
@SenThomTillis 11 years ago, more evidence of legal thought now and he was nominated by POTUS now under Intel Investigation
to bad mcconnel obstrucred Garland, when Garland is in you can have Gorsuch , Obstructionism KARMA
I agree to seat Gorsuch when there's a second vacancy, if Scalia's seat goes to Garland as it should have

@ThomTillis same could be said for Garland!
@ThomTillis So did Garland! This nominee is stolen!
@ThomTillis Garland was a good pick for everyone and you all did nothing. #notogorsuch
@ThomTillis vote no to Betsy DeVos for Sec Ed. She is unqualified and will gut our public schools.
1995-majority of R senators voted to confirm Garland--John McCain, Orrin Hatch, Susan Collins, and Jim Inhofe
@ThomTillis #BALLSLAW  Pt. 6  = Refugee Ban, Superbowl 51 , California 

https://youtu.be/6NipC22PDeQ 
@ThomTillis please do not vote for devos. Our children deserve better.
And also before they Unconstitutionally  STOLE Judge Garlands seat! Not even one hearing took place! SHAMEFUL! #LastTerm!
Also noteworthy, the fact that U R NOT listening to your constituents! NO to Devos, Sessions, Pruitt! #ENOUGH
#StolenSeat
Ppl can do alot in 11 yrs. that can change yr mind. Tweet something relevant.
@ThomTillis NOTEWORTHY: As McConnell said, it's the principle, not the person.
@ThomTillis  NUCLEAR OPTION IF NECESSARY. LEAVE SCHUMER who dictates most all dem senators do, in the dust
@ThomTillis That wasn't for SCOTUS, whole different bag of worms! No support of women or individual in his record. $$$ 1st!
@ThomTillis  not for Supreme Court
As soon as Merrick Garland gets his vote in the Senate I will fully support you demanding a vote for Gorsuch. #NeilGorsuch
@ThomTillis Major Disappointment for our country.
@ThomTillis I tried to call both your numbers; busy and full mailbox! Thanks for your consideration re: NO vote on DeVos!
@ThomTillis please vote NO on DeVos; unqualified & dangerous for our kids. Thanks for your service to our country, from OR!
did they miss his history of being in a club called fascism forever in college?
@ThomTillis support gorsuch but please vote against DeVos- she will ruin proud NC public schools!
NOTEWORTHY: #NeilGorsuch may be wonderful in every way but it's Garland's seat
@ThomTillis Protect women's rights #OpposeGorsuch
that was 10 years ago.
Follow what your constituents want!  Vote NO on DeVos!!!
@ThomTillis You know who else was soundly approved? Merrick Garland. Maybe you don't know who he is since you never met
- but NOT for SCOTUS.
President Obama should have gotten the opportunity to replace Justice Scalia. You are the pot calling the kettle black.
waiting for Schumer and Obama to explain how #NeilGorsuch became evil from the time they voted for him
This is different and if you think that will happen this time you are living in Fantasy Land. Democrats won't vote for him!
@TeriGRight But that was before Trump liked him!
it is questionable, perhaps asinine, to cite decade-old data as significant in this instance. Not noteworthy. #NeilGorsuch
define "unanimous" for you
@RepMarkWalker And he should be passed unanimously again...but we know it won't go down that way.
@jeffwkline confirm Garland
How many votes did Merrick Garland get?
well a few things have changed since then, haven't they? GOP put an incompetent racist sexist traitor in office
NOTEWORTHY: #MerrickGarland passed the Senate 76-23 in 1997, w/support from Oklahoma's Jim Inhofe
So did Merrick Garland! And yet....
Tough shit.

We've established no SCOTUS picks during campaigns.

Trump filed, opening his reelection campaign January 20.
remember this man, have you heard of him ? NOTEWORTHY #MerrickGarland4SCOTUS
Also NOTEWORTHY: he has a record since then that places him too far to the right. Oh, and that seat's been open with a nom.
big changes since then, I see you are also a blind crooked GOP cult follower as a Indiana voter I remember
this is what Reps said when Garland was nominated for appellate court.But they still refused to have a hearing for SCOTUS
Well he lost three votes. He'll have to dig up some more.

Merrick Garland's place stolen because Senate refused to do its Constitutional Duty trying to delegitimize Obama. Remember.
Now let's see how fast LibDems backtrack on this. Then they'll deny they ever said it
Does not matter! Garland should have had a hearing! You & GOP Obstructed! Shame on YOU!
And Garland was confirmed with the votes of Sens. McCain, Hatch, Collins and Inhofe, among others.
If you all can block Pres. Obama's nominees (looking at SCOTUS last year) to pressure him, Dems can now to pressure Trump.
@ThomTillis joe Biden-gone. HRC-gone. Obama-gone. Over 10 yrs ago. They don't matter anymore! Things have changed-aka Trump
scotus is different position than circuit court. Bad argument.
@RepLarryBucshon yeah, Democrats doing their job....any idea what that's like? #Traitors
shiner
Deny #Obama vote b/c ppl need a say by voting. #Trump loses popular vote but gets #SCOTUS nom b/c GOP STOLE THE SEAT! 
yes but republicans would not even give obamas choice a hearing.  Shame on you.
all of these guys!!
@ThomTillis remember the past 8 years Thom, payback is hell, grow a pair and take it like the #hypocrite you are.
@zachhaller stop bringing in facts. Those don't matter anymore, silly billy!
@ThomTillis suddenly you are responding to tweets.
@ThomTillis we are watching.
@grandlinda3033 There's this little problem with Democrats and selective memory.
@POTUS knows exactly what he's doing here. Checkmate.
@KathleenStaple3 Things have changed-no civility.U stole the seat from Merrick Garland.American history books won't forget.
So NOW will you stand up to Trump?  #NoBanNoWall
Hmm...interesting.
The Dems can filibuster and complain all the want, they will still end up butthurt in the end.
shame! Merrick Garland deserved a vote!
Merrick Garland's place stolen because Senate refused to do its Constitutional Duty trying to delegitimize Obama. Remember.
he's very pro-life, and anti-EPA, which is noteworthy considering we need clean air and water to live.
God created the Earth, the GOP who is SO christianly is out to destroy it! Wish there is a God to answer to
noteworthy they followed their constitutional duties and considered a nomination. Did you in 2016?
NOTEWORTHY: Republicans stole that seat from Merrick Garland, playing partisan politics. Dems will respond accordingly.
noteworthy, that was not for the Supreme Court. Should be blocked for at least 1,452 days.
NOTEWORTHY: You're a fuckstick.
Neil Gorsuch should be blocked by the Democrats!
NOTEWORTHY: Merrick Garland waited for a vote for 10+ plus months. That's a record.
Bush's nomination pick....19 months.
Who's that, now? Which Bush?
G.H.W. Bush.
still information missing, which of his SCOTUS noms sat dormant for 19 mos?
