@RepTrentFranks We're still waiting for the Nukes n Weed report you promised @briannarcnn What happened? Did ur dog eat it?
everything about that is bullshit
@RepTrentFranks How about the time YOU AND FELLOW REPUBLICANS DID NOT EVEN CONSIDER OBAMA'S NOMINEE! THAT WAS LAST YEAR!!!!
Just like you really did anything about Obama's supreme court nominee.  Hypocrites.  Sad for our country
That's rich considering you made @POTUS44 wait for confirmations. The current clown in charge takes
weekends off and flies to Florida, on OUR dime. Most of his cabinet picks  inexperienced in Govt.
STOP OBSTRUCTION BY NON PATRIOTIC CONGRESSMEN  Vote Them Out.  Mark them for catapult by 2018 via EMP ISSUE
The GOP wrote the book on obstructionism, so don't complain when the other side is playing by your rules
You right wingers obstructed Obama for EIGHT YEARS. You are in NO room to criticize anyone here.
How dare you complain to Oklahomans about obstruction when state education is at the bottom of nation. #NotoDeVos
Right, complain about education quality, then bash the one person nominated in the last 40 years who can fix it.
The proof is in the pudding. U have the ability to forsee the future? Blind loyalty.
Nope. Do you? Yet somehow you know she'll be horrible. Blind loyalty.
#nonsensical Ur saying the same by alleging she can fix it. Like predicting an ass to win the derby.
Precedence is key. #DeVos has an atrocious record on #edu with no proven success.
Maybe if 45 would stop appointing incompetents and traitors, it would speed things up a bit.
@RepTrentFranks picking through the unqualified takes longer than the qualified.
@RepTrentFranks Awww what's wrong, don't like to be treated how you guys treated Obama for eight years.
You should walk down to Library of Congress and check your facts before sending such smug inaccurate Tweets #LorettaLynch
The party of "NO" now wants Kumbaya? You reap what you sow! Where are Tump's taxes and who owns Trump debt?
They are terrified at the amount of work Trump will do. It will destroy their party.
@RepTrentFranks  After 8 years of obstruction you now want to talk about obstruction.  Sad!
@SenOrrinHatch pick better cabinet members. don't minimize questionings. vet them through ethics. and this wouldn't happen.
.rediculous. .this would happen no matter who is nominated. .democrats r against America. .fascists
Short sighted. Politics don't make people. And those who don't claim R or D gang? #gangster
@RepTrentFranks good to know the cabinet must be promptly addressed but the Supreme Court can wait when it's not your guy
Recall Garland SCOTUS obstruction. This back and forth is why Congress approval rating is low. Both sides at fault.
Not in this case. Garland was obviously qualified.
Where do you get your facts? Fox News I suppose.?
@RepTrentFranks we don't like racists in the White House, try putting some good people in and I'm sure they will get approv
@RepTrentFranks Maybe If they had been vetted properly and had all paperwork completed accurately before the hearings? Geez
.@SenatorLankford How can we move forward when the nominees want to bring us back to the past by destroying edu, epa, constitution? #resist
OMG Another foreigner troll!!!
I guess they took a page from the GOP book. I seem to remember you guys doing this a lot the last 8 years
@RepTrentFranks  INVESTIGATE RUSSIA TIES! DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR COUNTRY NOT PARTY! #TRUMPGATE #REMEMBERNIXON
Puzder had illegal immigrants. Devos has zero experience. Gorsuch is a radical!
This is McConnell's doing. He needs to be primaried and tossed over the side.
@RepTrentFranks INVESTIGATE RUSSIA TIES! DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR COUNTRY NOT PARTY! #TRUMPGATE #REMEMBERNIXON
Then vet ur choices better, then send them to congress. U didn't vet Trump well either. HISTAXESNOW.
@CongressmanHice that's because all of the picks are hideous.  Listen to your voters!!!  They are telling you this.
@RepTrentFranks this may be the most hypocritical thing I've ever seen. You people have conveniently short memories.
and it's a justified long walk. These people are not qualified
I'm guessing you mean the Democrats in the Senate...? Because it certainly isn't Trump's cabinet.
How is someone that has no experience in public education qualified?
Maybe public education is the problem. Therefore, experience in it makes one part of the problem.
I'll leave this here since no one would listen..
such tolerance for those who think differently. Not.
they say memory is the second thing to go.
@SenateGOP it's sad that ANY of you have the balls to scream about corruption when every single 1 of you should be removed!
and wait here is another little piece of food for thought..
And this is the most historically unqualified cabinet to ever be nominated. Length of time argument is failed logic.
Oh? Please do explain how this cabinet is unqualified in the slightest. No memes or biased "news" allowed.
http://wpo.st/6tv_2  -List @ Bottom. Openly hostile to depts nominated to run; no experience in field.
That hostility is what makes these nominations so great... They want to actually fix them.
No they don't. They want to dismantle them.
Sometimes, one must take something apart to put it back together properly. This is one of those times.
The problem is that she knows nothing about the department of education or education policy.
@RepTrentFranks That's a lie. But nice try. Why don't you ask the President about this? 515 positions AWAITING NOMINATION.
Some more fun facts, liars: Obama's last cabinet position was filled April 28th.
@RepTrentFranks when will you hold a live in person town hall?
And I hope they can keep it for four years!!!
How rich in calling out obstruction. Do you clueless hacks think the American public are that forgetful?
@RepTrentFranks I'll just leave this here... ahem.... Bullshit!
Why don't you stand up to Trump & what the conservative party is supposed to represent-not lies & hate
more than 500 of the positions to be confirmed are still without nominees. #HisFault #HisBad #YouLIE
There are more than 500 positions for which trump has YET to submit names. #HisFault #HisBad #YouLie
Mostly because trump is too lazy and disorganized to even submit names for consideration. #HisFault #HisBad
why rush to confirm this "historically unqualified cabinet" when Trump's too busy golfing to submit names?
@RepTrentFranks Remind me again what happened to Obamas Supreme Court Nominee? #Hypocrites
What a load of crap. GOP swore to obstruct Obama right from the start AND DID. Plus your border wall idiocy is pathetic.
@RepTrentFranks so it was ok to slow to a halt with Garland? How many of 45's noms delayed due to incomplete forms?
That's because of all the horrible choices!  And I'm a conservative!
Obamas Cabinet took longer to fill than other recent presidents stretching nearly his entire first 100 days
@SenThomTillis Perhaps if the Prez nominated people other than those to whom he owes payback????
stop spreading fake news. Investigate Trump/Russia connection.I will work night & day to make sure you are not re-elected!
@RepTrentFranks It's a fact; Trump is a total amateur and has an interesting definition for a swamp.
@RepTrentFranks How quickly did you "move on" on Garland Merrick? Remember: Fairness is a strong element of honesty.
@RepTrentFranks constituent here from CD 8 and Repubs wrote the book on obstruction. Two words Merrick Garland.
they like to act like BULLIES  on the play ground, LOOKING FOR DIRT ON PEOPLE
@SenThadCochran slowest govt to get going in #AmericanHistory. At a time it needs to be the fastest and most focused.
One word, or 2actually : Merrick Garland
It's because we are not fooled, like you, by @POTUS and his lack of transparency with his ties to Russia. #MICHAELFLYNN
Bahahahahahaha do you forget the last eight years of obstruction or are you a revisionist. Sad
@RepTrentFranks Its because #2Incompetent2BPresident appointed incompetent, dishonest peeps with conflicts of interest!
We're still waiting for Republicans to confirm Garland. And to investigate Russian treason. #Traitor
the republicans were good teachers in the tactics of obstruction.  Dems learned from the best.
You and the GOP set the gold standard!! Not so much fun when the Dems take a page from your book?
And a Schumer/Pelosi/Warren/ Obama R proud of their dirty work. More time to create inuendos,lies& protests: Org4America
Since this is what Rep. have done for the last 8 years why are you whining?
YOU LIE That has been debunked several times Bush 41 March, Clinton March, Obama April, Bush 43 only one before March.
MERRICK GARLAND, Senator.  You guys wrote the book on obstruction.  Karma's a bitch.
If any of the cabinet members were worth confirming, maybe the process wouldn't be taking so long.
Can't wait to talk to you during your town hall next week!  Oh, youre #cowardly not having one
Example: Tillerson/Putin EXXON/Rosnef now sanctions softened. Mnuchin LIED to Senate vicious foreclosure tactic.

This, of course, is demonstrably false. Clinton didn't have Cabinet in place until March 11. George HW was March 17. Obama not till April 28 https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/829133645055135750 â€¦
It is historic because the selection of appointees are skewed to the wealthy.  There are questions of Values.
Merrick Garland.
MERRICK GARLAND.
#Historic Destruction The People of the United States elect the Senate. Let's remember that #Constitution
Damn, you have some nerve after refusing to even interview Merrick Garland. YOU are the obstructionist, sir.
could it be becuz this has arguably been the most incompetent cabinet in US history? Definitely the richest!
@RepTrentFranks this is an untrue statement so i.e. It's a lie. Stop the lies
Why is @realDonaldTrump Against the Democrats, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
LIAR. @SenateMajLdr LIARS ALL OF YOU!
Maybe if @POTUS nominated qualified people, you'd have less trouble.
@SenateMajLdr but that's not true .
@RepTrentFranks Do you even CARE that this is a bald-faced lie? Never mind ... we already know you don't. You're spineless.
@SenateMajLdr good
Have you considered that this could be because his picks are grossly unqualified? Your support for DeVos was a disgrace.
He hasn't even vetted his applicants properly. How can you say it is taking historic lengths of time?
@sendavidperdue The Administration didn't have it's act together, as you well know.
This is so hypocritical.  Do you think the electorate is blind to what the R's did to O?
-derpy-derp
@Timcurr41013255 This is ridiculous #SenateDems Approve the #CabinetNow #WeThePeople want the #Cabinet in 4 @POTUS
That's not true. I see you've bought into the #alternativefacts http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38913709 â€¦
Two words: Merrick Garland. That's #HistoricObstruction
@KathyVurchio The democrats, all of them, are Disgusting traitors. Hate every one of them
Senate filibusters of my gov'ts cabinet Appts r Mini gov't shutdowns. Any chance of changing the Senate rules?
Even a Republican Senate has trouble gagging down the sort of nominees Donald Trump drags before them.
@SenMikeLee U.S. Senators cannot be posting lies. This is verifiably false, Sirs. http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38913709 â€¦
@SenMikeLee This is false, Senators. Bush's cabinet confirmed 3/11, Clinton's 3/17, Obama's on 4/28. Obama is record holder
That's because Trump's SWAMP CABINET is a bunch of incompetent crooks!
@SenThomTillis Because it's a Swamp.
behavior learned by hemming and hawing during the last administration's attempts at a SCOTUS appointment.
Actually, Clinton took longer and so did Obama, your sporting alt-facts again!
Worst batch of rich, ignorant pre-packaged know-nothings ever to be proposed. #DeVos not qualified for school janitor.
@sendavidperdue you know this isn't true right.....
Do you people read or just post nonsense hoping no one else is smart enough to know your lying?
@SenMikeLee #alternativefacts
You harmed Obama's noms, so please go away.
@RoyBlunt we will #MoveUp not #MoveOn & that starts with replacing the 2 of you
@RoyBlunt The fact that TWO US senators posted this knowing it's historically inaccurate is unfathomable.
I will mention that these cabinet picks are all roundly terrible. #trumpcaneatabagofbutts #weakleadership
Maybe Trump should nominate more qualified people.
@mspretty7159 drain the swamp please
Do your research- obviously you like being a liar just like the GOP party and Fox News. Info is FALSE
@senategop It's taking a long time to confirm the Cabinet, because WE constituents think the choices are UNAMERICAN
MERRICK. GARLAND.
@sendavidperdue THIS IS ALSO A LIE, you lying liar.
@RoyBlunt LOL! You have done nothing for the last 8 years and now you complain after 2 weeks !!!! HAHAHAHAHA
LOL! You have done nothing for the last 8 years and now you complain after 2 weeks !!!! HAHAHAHAHA
Yep Payback
Yes to DeVos, Yes to Sessions and Yes to silencing a female. Women are watching you. #Neverthelessshepersisted
Either you are lying or you are very misinformed - check out when Bush and Obama's cabinets were confirmed.
@SenMikeLee yes because the Dems keep fighting all the way. We voted for Trump now do your jobs, Bad example 4 our kids
Never have so many unqualified people been nominated.
Get some qualified people & not just #TRUMP billionaire friends
@SenThadCochran dems want to delay as long as possible.....typical.
@SenateMajLdr Merrick Garland.
We will never move on as long as human rights are under attack. Better get used to us @SenatorLankford @SenThomTillis 

#resist #ResistTrump
Sign this position demanding town hall meetings so @SenThomTillis can explain himself #TheResistance
You lying @GOP hypocrites really have no shame or ethics, do you? @SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr http://www.warren.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=1155 â€¦ @SenWarren
why don't republicans share in the blame for creating this divisiveness for the last 8 years--racism
@SenThadCochran his nominees aren't qualified to be confirmed Senator!!! They are all PATHETIC!!
@SenatorRisch this is completely false.
@SenatorRisch because the choices SUCK!
.@SenatorLankford .@RoyBlunt we are not done and you are not done hearing about it.
.@SenatorLankford .@RoyBlunt How dare you act as though apprehension for those picks is wrong. Caution does not equal obstruction. Hear us!
@SenThomTillis Merrick Garland
You've had time to fact check this post. It's inaccurate. You're either misinformed or deliberately lying.
@RoyBlunt Two words: Merrick Garland #potmeetkettle
@SenThadCochran LIAR
8 yrs of Obama obstruction & you have the gall to whine about obstruction? HAHAHAHAHA! Trump's out, you're out.
@SenOrrinHatch This is lies. GHW Bush did not get cabinet confirmed until MARCH! Why do you lie to the American people.
Really? I think it's time to move on from Senator Lankford.
changes comes from within...youre going the wrong way ....Search your heart and you will change your mind
The reason confirmations have taken so long? Your constituents were saying NO. You didn't listen.  Shame.
@SenThomTillis Just ask them to confirm decent people instead of facists! The people don't want them to be confirmed!
because they are unqualified billionaires with zero qualifications who plagiarize and lie.
This is also a lie.
