@DarrellIssa @drea4liberty   If Cummings seriously believes the investigation is over, remove him from the committee. Lacks good judgment.
@hildismom @DarrellIssa @drea4liberty Lacks good judgement? I have a gerbil with better reasoning skills. Cummings is a complete idiot.
@DeatonCAPT @DarrellIssa @drea4liberty I was being kind!  I agree with you completely!!
@DarrellIssa @gardenofthegods We The People haven't seen it solved!  1 guy in 1 office sounds a little fishy seeing as many offices involved
@DarrellIssa Release the transcripts in full and prove him wrong.  If not, STFU!
@DarrellIssa resposible oversight would be to name a special prosecutor with a grand jury and to stop worrying about your own spotlights.
@DarrellIssa @hildismom  Rep Cummings is idiot. We want #ACCOUNTABILITY & do not have that for #CRIMES against Ams.
@DarrellIssa @GeneMcVay Of course it's not, but it's no surprise. Nothing to see here. Move on...
@DarrellIssa Release ALL transcripts.
@DarrellIssa No, it is Gross Misconduct and a violation of his Oath. Time to hold all to account for such obstruction.
@DarrellIssa @tweetcongress @GOP Congress' Inaction 2 Prosecute Exec Branch Crimes is TREASON. Honor Your Oath. http://beforeitsnews.com/obama/2013/06/obamas-case-for-impeachment-video-2452504.html …
@DarrellIssa unfortunately it depends on who,s Ox is being gored, maybe next time it will be theirs!
@DarrellIssa @Norsu2 Not! The Congressman was just trying to redirect media from POTUS. Not 2 smart, if the war on T is over #NSA Prism ??
@DarrellIssa If Rep. Cummings says case is closed, you are getting close to the unrevealed truth
@DarrellIssa @Nors Old lady on the bus went.  Bet he got hammerd by DemocRATS, BET that BO panderer Crawley LIAR last DEBATE, told him.
@DarrellIssa Tell Boehner, McConnell & Kantor to get off their lazy asses. All 3 are useless.
@DarrellIssa In a word NO! Remember Obama does not respect the Constitution. He has repeatedly ignored it when it does not suit him.
@DarrellIssa @GeneMcVay no it's not oversight..it's Democrats being Democrats.
@DarrellIssa Cummings wishes you'd move on. Like BHO he thinks we're as stupid & gullible as their sheeple. Ask if R he would want 2 move on
@DarrellIssa Release all of the transcripts, you lying car-thief! @oreillyfactor @gretawire @jonkarl @seanHannity #GoodbyeGOP
@DarrellIssa please don't let up on IRS. Cummings was critical at hearing but I guess Obama got to him to change his mind
@DarrellIssa @Norsu2 We must remind CONGRESS, its unconditional loyalty oath to the Constitution and not the President. Article VI Clause 3
@DarrellIssa @Norsu2 There isn't middle term, or you are loyal to the Constitution or you are not @Senate_GOPs @GOPoversight #TCOT @politico
Book 'em Darrell...Yesterday, if not sooner!  @DarrellIssa
@imsure @DarrellIssa Go for it...
.@DarrellIssa @VickiMDonovan Cummings is a racist idiot and shouldn't be in any position of power
@DarrellIssa So they are getting close to the truth, pointing to the WH
@DarrellIssa No,of course not! Theater politics 2 deceive & portray concern 4 what is right&just. R enemy is those who violate US Constit!
@DarrellIssa I thought I saw Cummings' lips moving.  Does anybody take him seriously?  He is an embarrassment.
@DarrellIssa @cathymichelleha no more than grahm and mccain becoming democrate
@DarrellIssa @dlb703 they don't want the truth out because the progressives like using the irs against their foes
@DarrellIssa Give up Issa. Cummings proves you are a twat with a BS probe. You committed arson, you should be in jail.
@DarrellIssa @RepKerryB it's very obvious, obama got to him! #tcot #ccot #ctot #opslam #lnyhbt @TPNNtweets
@DarrellIssa @KHShan #IRS un-believable!!
@DarrellIssa Not by any stretch of the imagination. It's partisanship at its worst. It makes me wonder why....
@DarrellIssa You are wasting your time. IRS should just follow the law as written. Congress should pass a bill that IRS cannot change laws.
@DarrellIssa @Merry__Can Is it responsible that YOU will not call for an independent #SpecialProsecutor? #tcot
@DarrellIssa @Merry__Can Pretty sure the RINOs will go along with the communists.
@DarrellIssa no
@DarrellIssa NO! Keep the pressure on Sir! I recommend abolishing the #IRS and institute a flat tax!
@DarrellIssa its because he is involved!
@DarrellIssa yes, whats going on? Who are you fighting for? America, the Republic ,like y'all swore to do? We are awake time to act  NOW
@DarrellIssa @MikePevoto Cummings is an idiot! Isn't he the one who thought Guam would tip over? #CREDIBILITY
.@DarrellIssa Another feeble attempt of Cummings 2 protect Obama like when he said Benghazi was "an attempt to embarrass our dear president"
@DarrellIssa Hell no!!  KEEP investigating !!
@DarrellIssa  Take charge.  Don't let Democrats decide what's right when obviously they have no conscience or moral conviction.
@DarrellIssa no. But fact they want to move on possibly indicative of something worse they don't want found.
@DarrellIssa Not surprised, we no longer have a constitution or Bill of Rights, we have Dictator Obama and minions who decide what law is
@edwrather @DarrellIssa The Politically Correct DNC & #IRS #DOJ have declared All Conservatives or Patriots OBSOLETE!
@DarrellIssa Cummings is out to help Obama.That was always his intent.His opening statement at #IRS hearings then he backtracked proved that
@DarrellIssa yes.. end the chicanery now.. testimony shows no WH conspiracy
What #ElijahECummings said match the Bush-appointed I.G. findings! So you @DarrellIssa is Mr Accuse Then Prove! #LyingCrook #tcot @Gretawire
@DarrellIssa The level of arrogance is unbelievable, the level of contempt for America, unprecedented.
@DarrellIssa Elijah Cummings does not speak for all of us and we deserve to know the truth. #IRS
@DarrellIssa @ReCorwin No. This is not oversight this is collusion.
@DarrellIssa @ReCorwin Is Just part of Cover up and Cummins should be ashamed!
What #ElijahECummings said match Bush-appointed I.G. findings! So you @DarrellIssa is Mr Accuse Then Prove! #LyingCrook! @Oreillyfactor #GOP
@DarrellIssa It isn't. And with the committee so obviously compromised you need to hand off to special prosecutors.
@DarrellIssa Release full transcripts they will reveal your witch hunt.  You can't cherry pick facts Issa
@DarrellIssa Not sure which one is the more partisan of the two in this video.
@DarrellIssa DoYouEverThink of the 4804Families you sentenced to death in #AbortionIraq
while DiaperGeorgie languished
inACrawfordOuthouse?¥
@DarrellIssa he is just one of america's problem
@DarrellIssa Add Sebelius private funding grab to scandal pattern. God bless!
“@DarrellIssa: Is this responsible oversight? Top Dem on Oversight calls for end of #IRS investigation: http://bit.ly/105t8sK ”
@DarrellIssa don't stop looking into irs
@DarrellIssa Their irrational calls for an end means only 1 thing - the investigation is getting too close to O. KEEP PUSHING FOR TRUTH!
@DarrellIssa The pattern of abuse from F and F to Benghazi..IRS..NSA..Rosen...must be completely investigated. Scary for all.
@DarrellIssa If @ElijahECummings releases documents ~~will he be deemed a 'whistleblower' who can be prosecuted by Eric Holder?
@DarrellIssa hell no they need to close the IRS
@DarrellIssa The fox has investigated itself and determined the hen house is secure. This is not a surprising outcome.
@DarrellIssa NOPE it's called cut and run from the truth. DEMOCRATS CAN'T STAND FOR TRUTH TO BE TOLD
@DarrellIssa Hell NO!!!
@DarrellIssa DO NOT end invstgtn until all evidence is gathered.  We DO NEED results be4 next election cycle 2 know the criminals in BO adm
@DarrellIssa Why the change of heart all of a sudden?  This investigation must continue along with the other scandal investigations.
.@DarrellIssa #Benghazi #FastAndfurious #NSA #Epa #IRS #AP #PRISM & more 2come what r UR plans on this&Boehners lack of action @Kathy_Amidon
@DarrellIssa Get Rid of AG Holder. Clean up Obama corruption. If NSA can get common American's E-mails,why not Holder's or IRS, Etc.
@DarrellIssa It's outrageous4Elijah Cummings 2quickly seize Repub IRS manager's stmt, wrap up IRS scandal & move on. We want the facts.
@DarrellIssa No. Cummings just does not want to hear the truth anymore.
@DarrellIssa Keep up the good work Mr. Issa. Please don't let Benghazi fall through the cracks.
@DarrellIssa Me too, let's end the investigation AND the #IRS #DefundIRS
@DarrellIssa Mr. Cummings, a Socialist, is trying to protect the Obama Administration from possible impeachment for misuse of IRS powers.
@DarrellIssa He is out of line. If ever was a serious reason for Oversight, it is now. Thank you for your work on this IRS mess.
@DarrellIssa - If Candy Crowley is involved with Cummings it is most certainly is cover for their Dear Leader.
@DarrellIssa Democrats are in bed with IRS targeting Conservatives. Top Democrats REQUESTED IRS investigate Conservation 2yrs. ago.
@DarrellIssa Darrell  the NSA is monitoring our phone calls and e-mail and your investigation a nothing IRS story STUPID #p2 #IRS #NSA
@DarrellIssa Since the major question of who was responsible has now been answered, isn't it time we moved onto something more productive
@DarrellIssa because he can't handle the truth
@DarrellIssa Yes stop the witch hunts and get to work.  Tax TP they are not social org.  Overturn Citizens United
@DarrellIssa Cummings is in the bag for the Administration. No credibility there. He's talking to Candy Crowley? That's impartial for ya!
@DarrellIssa Hmmm. Anger, end to#investigation... #Fear of what is going to be @discovered!
@DarrellIssa No, he doesn't want the truth to get out.  There is a whole lot more there there.
@DarrellIssa Oh no way! There's still a great deal to investigate! I think we should abolish the IRS and the EPA.
@DarrellIssa DvsR? Mr Cummings apparently does not know the nature and quality of the act committed -sounds like grounds for insanity plea
@DarrellIssa Nothing much that I see from that side of the isle is responsible...
@DarrellIssa He's being political. Something the Dems accuse the Republicans of doing that all the time. Pot/kettle. (Just saying)
@DarrellIssa Cummings parades one name of local IRS Supervisor as proof of non interference from Washington. Get the tinfoil hats.
@DarrellIssa Delaying apps. 9 months after election, spying on political opponents, and shafting small business is egregious abuse of rights
@DarrellIssa Just pathetic!
@DarrellIssa Do not give in AMERICA'S FUTURE DEPENDS ON YOU!
@LotofLabs @DarrellIssa Don't give in to Corruption..Cummings is protecting Top Democrats who targeted Conservatives using the IRS.
@DarrellIssa Stop acting like a spoiled child!  It us not befitting the office you hold.
@DarrellIssa  Elijah Cummins is done with his FAKE outrage so it's time now to move on with Obama's Socialist takeover of the country
@DarrellIssa you need 2 call this guy out publicly-the dems r against poverty-their pundits and politicians speak from intellectual poverty.
“@DarrellIssa: Is this responsible oversight Top Dem on Oversight calls 4 end of #IRS investigation: http://bit.ly/105t8sK  #AbolishtheIRS
@DarrellIssa NO
