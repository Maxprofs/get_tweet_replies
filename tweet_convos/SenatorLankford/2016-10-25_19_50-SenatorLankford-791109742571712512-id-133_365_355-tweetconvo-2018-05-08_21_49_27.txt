No shit. It's like the 66th time you have tried to repeal it. How about you do some GOOD for the country?
Reason #2565 why I hate politicians.
and your point is?? We like it, just want it tweaked. Your agenda doesn't matter.
Elect @realDonaldTrump and @mike_pence and they will surely take care of it!
You guys do the same thing over and over, expecting new outcomes. February 2, your National Holiday?
@jasoninthehouse Anyone else remember Nancy Pelosi said of the 2000 page ACA: 'Just sign it. You can read it at the break.'
@jasoninthehouse He wants to destroy USA any way he can. Bate Putin to bomb us or bankrupt us via Obamacare.
REPEAL BHO!
59 or 63 times you wasted time to kill ACA. Then U cry because nothing gets done.

My daughter benefited greatly from Obamacare.  Without it, she would have nothing.  Thankful!!
Well if the F.B.I didn't re-open her case. It would have been called Hillary Care ! Watch YouTube !New MSM
.@SenatorLankford @jasoninthehouse Note to Phony Opposition Party Members: That's why the framers put funding power in Article I #STOP LYING
@jasoninthehouse Naturally. Did you expect less. The American people will suffer while a blind eye is turned.
@jasoninthehouse friends on my Facebook had premiums of 1600 plus a month. That is completely horrible
Try proposing single payer
paid for by cutting pentagon waste
Declare Peace and use the peace dividend
@jasoninthehouse as he should-8years later GOP still sucking at the Insurance lobby teete.
@jasoninthehouse GOOD you people hate AFCA but have plans it it is eliminated
. @SenatorLankford @jasoninthehouse how much $$$ have Republicans spent fighting the Affordable Care Act? Where could that money have gone?
Last I checked, Obama is out of office. Have you guys repealed this yet? No? Oh, right, you don't have anything after 7yrs
Huma's Weiner Trumped A Clinton ! ..............quote of the day ! by Keith Freitas
@jasoninthehouse good! Now let the Affordable Care Act go through as he intended - health isn't only for the rich!!
@jasoninthehouse would Obamacare be replaced by Jasoncare or Ryancare

@jasoninthehouse @jasoninthehouse Thank God. Wasn't even insurable B4 Obamacare. Trump will replace it with what? Bluster?
Another load of #Republican  put before #POTUS #Obama!  When will you learn you idiots? #SimplyTheBest @jasoninthehouse
how many times you gonna try this? 70? 80? come up with some FIXES and show us you're WORKING
HOW DUMB IS THIS ~ these morons are still wasting time + money - get rid of @GOP
, the dark underlying connotation of what @SenatorLankford is saying is his #RedNationRising rebels hates anything that unifies #USA.
, @SenatorLankford "supports loosening restrictions on interstate gun purchases. He opposes firearm microstamping." #Deplorable.
later, let's take @SenatorLankford to #AltReich HQ & help him understand that he enables the division of .
Hitlerians @NewtGingrich @JasonInTheHouse @AnnCoulter @SeanSpicer @Reince. JC-Like @SenMikeLee @MittRomney @SenSasse @JeffFlake.
, @2Miche & I expect you to accept the current image of @JasonInTheHouse.  You'll be with villains. https://twitter.com/Birdseye1/status/791855887065284608 …
Then U must Support @realDonaldTrump & get him elected if UR serious about repealing Obamacare
@jasoninthehouse OBAMACARE SAVED MY LIFE
@jasoninthehouse How many is that, fifty?
if the had a pair of they would have overturned the veto. Stop whining and get to work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY8FwWwIVyQ …
When will Congress put a bill improving ACA on President's desk? You've had nearly 8 years.
.@SenatorLankford @jasoninthehouse one usually vetoes bills that do not contain solutions but just more problems.
why should they fix something they never broke, or agreed to which is bad for the ppl, simple as that
The aca insures 20 million ppl and cover pre-existing conditions. Does your plan do this
he will continue to veto it unless you can give him a alternitive plan or a new plan.
@jasoninthehouse For the 70th time?  Insanity is doing the same thing over and over expecting different result.
The GOP does love its empty gestures.
@jasoninthehouse 60 Xs you have wasted taxpayer's money on repealing. That money could have been spent on fixing problems.
@jasoninthehouse You have no viable alternative. And millions lose coverage. Doesn't affect you so that doesn't matter.
Thanks for nothing, it's all a show. Let's see if you are a real American when Trump is elected,
@jasoninthehouse ua think!
@jasoninthehouse thank god. Or 20 million people would have lost their health insurance.
Gee... no shit... worthless Representatives
@jasoninthehouse stupid of GOP congress
In your mind, only the elite deserve medical care. #Asshole
@jasoninthehouse Why don't your write and pass legislation to adjust and repair the ACA. Let's not throw the baby out too.
Leave my Obamacare alone!
@jasoninthehouse What's your solution to fix healthcare? Repeal is NOT a solution, just another meaningless sound bite
Shocker!!!! Congress put a bill to repeal #Obamacare on POTUS desk. FIX IT Lazy Asses!!!! Is this a joke?
@jasoninthehouse can we veto the two of you? Embarrassing. Not worthy of the office you hold.
- when are you going to get a supreme court judge vetted? Don't we pay you to do your 
work?
@jasoninthehouse and? You want a medal?
Yes, because you have NO PLAUSIBLE alternative. You will all be gone soon. Losers.
@jasoninthehouse unless you ppl are making others suffer you're just not happy...
no kidding.  Who'd a thunk it.
@jasoninthehouse thank god he did, let me ask if you have health insurance, let me ask if you care whether or not I do...
And you can't figure out why GOP is going to lose? @jasoninthehouse
.@jasoninthehouse No, they can't. Just as stupid as .@realDonaldTrump, Giuliani, Christie. #NastyWomenVote
.@SenatorLankford .@jasoninthehouse You SOBs will get yours for selling people out for the oligarchs. #fascists
No shit. @jasoninthehouse
@jasoninthehouse you're going to be gone soon promise to vote you out
.@SenatorLankford @jasoninthehouse 
YES, because unlike you, despite its faults, Obamacare's done some real good for people in this country.
@jasoninthehouse Where was your replacement plan? Didn't think so..
have it ready in January!!
@jasoninthehouse thankfully our Constitution allows that you losing obstructing piece of nonsense and waste.
@jasoninthehouse Quit crying and go to work to Garner the votes and over turn veto.  Have you thought to go after Treason!
@jasoninthehouse of course he did
@SunshineforTRU1 OBAMA IS ALSO ABOVE THE LAW JUST AS HIS CRONIES THEY LIE AND LOOK YOU IN THE EYE BREAKS LAWS AND CONSTITU
Ok. That accounts for THAT FIVE MINUTES. WHAT THE HELL HAS CONGRESS DONE SINCE?
Congress took SHOW VOTES, and flung SHOW BILLS in all directions. WHILE ABDICATING IT'S POWER OF THE PURSE.
@jasoninthehouse How on earth is this possible. The sky might as well fall in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujs3yEXbvWs …
@jasoninthehouse That's OK, we'll take care of it after Jan 20/2017. The Trump train. 
@jasoninthehouse if u put a put a bill on his desk for single payer that would be news. Instead, I wonder, why do we pay u?
@jasoninthehouse @SenatorLankford - put the sucker up again and override it while he watches!
question I cannot find an answer to this. IF you repeal Obamacare, there are many of us who will lose insurance.
But the question lies within the situation of ppl being diagnosed w/ condition under Obamacare then lose their ins ---->
Does it then become a pre-existing condition under new insurance?  If so, they may not be covered or cost will be too high.
They don't care.  You're just a pawn in their game to deny any political victory to President Obama.
@jasoninthehouse - Congress needs to get on the ball w/this.
@jasoninthehouse so unify the @GOP behind @realDonaldTrump #Disrupter #MAGA
@jasoninthehouse of course he did. Jesus Christ put an impeachment vote out there.  Maybe that will get some traction.
@jasoninthehouse Yes and it was wasted effort. Just like the British fighting in marching lines versus guerrilla fighters.
@jasoninthehouse should have tried to override who likes obamacare
@jasoninthehouse Really? You have the power of the purse, why didn't you defund it????????
@jasoninthehouse what has congress done to improve AHA
Absolutely nothing. They're on vacation too much to do anything.
@jasoninthehouse 
And was there a subsequent vote to override the veto? Send him off with a good one.
@jasoninthehouse send him another one
Not shocking! Don't Obama make money off it by labeling it Obamacare?
Unfortunately only those of us that follow closely know that b/c MSM never reports it - U need better PR
@TGowdySC @jasoninthehouse  Shows his part in globalizing the USA, #VETOOBAMA himself
too many lapdogs to exercise congressional override too...... #disgusted
