.@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs Lankford, aren't you a lame duck? You need to stop working until the voters decide whether to keep you or not
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr cool, scalia coulda kicked the bucket a long time ago then
@SenatorLankford Thanks for holding the line! #UniteWithCruz
@SenatorLankford This whole obstructionism reminds me of the analogy we ask kids. If Jimmy jumped off a cliff, would you follow him?
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr Doesn't matter. The constitution says you have a job to do. You aren't doing it. #DoYourJob
@SenatorLankford Only due to it suiting you. From YOUR page, no less. Just do your job.
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr The CONSTITUTION HAS NOT BEEN AMENDED. OUR PRESIDENT HAS POWER TO APPOINT SCOTUS, not LAZY INCOMPETENT GOP!
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs this is so idiotic - of course in can function but 4-4 decisions set no precedents - waste of resources
.@SenatorLankford per President Reagan: "Every day that passes with [#SCOTUS] below full strength impairs the people's business" #askpressec
@PressSec @SenatorLankford what happens if it is 4 vs 4?  what is the outcome?
@arkansas52 @PressSec @SenatorLankford then the lower court ruling stands and law on the issue is unsettled
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr Just say NO! No Garland in 2016. SCOTUS is ok until 2017
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr Beside the point! #DoYourJob
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs what exactly are you up to in Senate
.@SenatorLankford,
& I just here & now
debunked the notion
that #Repubes
put USA ahead of GOP.
Do KochBros got dirt on u2?
cc @SenateMajLdr
@superguts @SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr Wrote Lankford about SCOTUS nomination & other issues - got back GOP boilerplate - dirt on him?
.@PhiKapMom @SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr
Any1 incl.Clarence Thomas who visits #KochBros retreats
risks being video-doc'd w/2 hookers.#ALEC
@superguts @SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr You can take that to the bank.  Can you imagine the video out there on OK Governor?
.@PhiKapMom @SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr
Or Snyder? - says he kicks'mself every day
but,in the wrong place-
Should be in jail.
#Flintwater
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr The court should stop all cases until a full panel of judges is seated!
@SenatorLankford it's hurting GOP reminding independents of GPP gridlock.
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs if you feel that way why don't you just become a Democrat
Fact @SenatorLankford without a 9th Justice, this divided #SCOTUS is unlikely to decide any law. Ties don't count. Nor do your lies.
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs The people gave their voice when they elected the President to 4 year term, not a 3 1/4 year term. #DoYourJob
@SenatorLankford #DoYourJob #ImNotAnIdiot
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs #SCOTUS The People elected @POTUS in 2 consecutive elections. Hold Hearings. Vote. It's not hard, really.
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr Shame on you Senator. Maybe we should debunk the idea that Senators are actually supposed to do their job.
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr Why settle for less? We're paying for 9 Justices, let's have 9 Justices. #DoYourJob
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr the functionality of the court is not in question. your ethics and morals are questionable #DoYourJob
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs 
In 2008/2012 WE ppl elected Democratic POTUS& Repubs have been fucking w/him ever sense.  Give us Garland!
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr 
*fewer than
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr Take an arithmetic class. The court is hobbled when there are 8 judges likely to vote 4-4.
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr Missing the point #nomoreexcuses #DoYourJob we don't need to be told what to think #americansarentstupid
@SenatorLankford You are a follower. The SCOTUS nominee is fully qualified. Now #DoYourJob  or next election there can be a new senator.
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr The ppl demand a fair vote! #DoYourJob
#SCOTUSnominee @Senate_GOPs
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs let's see if the Senate can run with one less #republicansenator
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr Have you met Donald Trump? This kind of BS created him and his large following.
@SenatorLankford do your job. Appalling prejudice. History will shame you.
@SenatorLankford continuing your BS, what you don't seem to understand that THE PEOPLE, wether DEM's or REP's don't want obstructionist
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs FACT: The American people elected Obama. Twice. You are pathetic. #DoYourJob or expect to be FIRED.
@SenatorLankford This is like a child putting off doing his homework #DoYourJob
@SenatorLankford #dothejobwepayyou4  is all we are saying. As my elected official I demand you vote for or against
@SenatorLankford  You are really scratching at straws now. When is your term up? I will remember the Senators that shunned the Constitution.
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs I bet we could survive with term limits in the senate too! Do your job, or resign.
@SenatorLankford Boy, if I came up with excuses like that at my job, I wouldn't have one. #DoYourJob
@SenatorLankford if you want to keep your job you need to do your job...that's how it works for most Americans..are you an American?
@SenatorLankford #DoYourJob
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr if this were a GOP president you'd hold a hearing long before the election.
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr real ppl will not have their cases heard on its merits. The Senate GOP is obstructing because it's Obama
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr the current court is so divided that an even number of justices creates a likely unclear position.
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr I'm debunking you as having anything more that an opinion.
@SenatorLankford Fact or fiction: You're engaging in obstructionism. Fact!
@SenatorLankford Try debunking the idea that @Senate_GOPs can ignore Constitutional duties. Listen to the voters, not Mitch. #DoYourJob
@SenatorLankford Trump Wait- Hillary Do it- cuz the 2nd is going to be pounded anyway. Could be worse. If she picks!
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr just because they "can" doesn't mean they "should". #DoYourJob
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr OBSTRUCTIONIST.  GOP OBSTRUCTIONIST.  YOU CAN'T EVEN HAVE A COURTESY MEETING? WTF?
@SenatorLankford Just silliness. Disingenuous. Straw man Have you no shame?  #DoYourJob
@SenatorLankford You represent my state! The #SCOTUSnominee is a hero to our state, WHY WOULD YOU NOT NOMINATE HIM???
@SenatorLankford POTUS is still POTUS. Do your damn job and hold the hearings!!!!
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr Why would a decent American think it is ok to have only 8 members for over a year? Just over politics? SHAME
@SenatorLankford Merrick is ANTI 2A. If you cave, you are certain to see riots BEFORE you deny Trump the nom. Things are serious out here.
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr Do your job. It's that simple.
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr The Constitution contains no mechanism to break tie votes in SCOTUS; an even # of Justices = cases at risk.
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs .  I bet the Senate could operate just fine without you. #DoYourJob .
@SenatorLankford I love the endless sting of non sequitur arguments coming out to support this obstructive position.
.@SenatorLankford Here's how you can help unseat the OBSTRUCTIONISTS:
.@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr Not a problem this gives us a tool to VOTE ALL OF YOU OUT & raise money to do it. Thanks for the assist!!
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr yes the Supreme Court can do their job with 8 justices. Please #DoYourJob and give Garland a vote.
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr STOP PISSING ON THE CONSTITUTION! Yes I'm shouting at you! #DoYourJob
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr #DoYourJob !!
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr #doyourjob #POTYS did his, and very well, btw.
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr do your job or #resign #gop #SCOTUSnominee
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr But why should it if you #DoYourJob
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr #DoYourJob
@SenatorLankford
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr Do your job. Give Gsrland a hearing.
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr Follow the Grassley rule from July 2008, Protecting American Justice. Do your job.
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr #doyourjob
@SenatorLankford Maybe the US Senate could/should do with one less senator! #ivote
@SenatorLankford I debunk the idea you and Inhofe are good for Oklahoma!
@SenatorLankford Excuse number 4 for not doing your job!
@SenatorLankford it sucks that you and Inhofe represent my State. I will work to get you both out of the Senate!
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr What shall we call this ,'The Lankford Lie'.
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr Be honest- you've spent 7 years blocking #POTUS , this is no different.  DO YOUR JOB.
@SenatorLankford 
Thank you Senator!
#NEXTPOTUSPICKSNEXTSCOTUS
@SenatorLankford 
This morning I watched a U Tube video of you explaining your position of NOT bringing up SCOTUS vote. Where is it now?
On March 16, 2016, Senator Lankford gave a floor speech on the Supreme Court vanancy and the nomination of Merrick Garland. U Tube
@SenatorLankford you cant debunk the fact that that you re refusing to do your job. You are costing GOP election.
@SenatorLankford you and @jiminhofe are being subsidized by the taxpayer to flagrantly disregard your responsibilities. #termlimits
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs Chuck Grassley likes #SCOTUS so do millennials voters. #DoYourJob #gopFAIL #https://t.co/gs6o168myp

Can we request expulsion @SenatorLankford & @SenateMajLdr because you refuse to #DoYourJob? #askingforafriend #SCOTUSnominee
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs  What is the rush to approve a SCOTUS, we have been without a POTUS for 7yrs so far. We can wait few months.
@SenatorLankford Thank you for this tweet. Americans who don't know the history of the Supreme Court doing great harm to our future.
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs Fact: you don't do your jobs. Fiction: you deserve reelection.
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr Wow. Talk about a sophomoric argument.
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs #LATIMES THANK YOU SENATOR! Education for these YOUNG inexperienced uneducated MEDIA TV & Newspaper Reporters
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs #CBSNews #FOXNews Education for these YOUNG inexperienced uneducated MEDIA TV & Newspaper Reporters
@SenatorLankford Since Congress controls the number of judges, Eight appears to be OK for now!!
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs trying to confuse SIMPLE minded folks with this #BULLSHIT?!?  Post the excerpt from the Constitution! #SCOTUS
@SenatorLankford  I have kids in my class, but I'm not gonna teach them b/c a new principal next year might give me better ones? #doyourjob
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr Sure, let's have lots of ties so the lower courtdecision stands, right or wrong. Why not just #DoYourJob?
@SenatorLankford #DoYourJob The American people have already voted for @POTUS
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr True: this just means all if those lower court liberal rulings will stand in the event of Supreme Court tie.
Where does the Constitution gives you the right to delay? Serve the document, not your party goals. @SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr #SCOTUS
@MySmartPuppy @SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr Sahara u should read the very paper ur referring 2. Its There! Clue" ck the Amendments. After 5
@SenatorLankford Before the Judiciary Act of 1869, statute set the court at 10 justices! A complete set of justices was an even number!
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr And you could get by w one less arm or leg, but do you want to? Do your job!
@SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr I FEEL LIKE WE COULD OPERATE  ON A FEW LESS SENATORS, THAT'S FOR SURE
@AngryNIdaho @SenatorLankford @SenateMajLdr Bunch of them! Living on the backs of us tax payers. Spend. Regulation. No common since.
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs Show respect 4 SCOTUS & Constitution.  Americans elected POTUS for 4 yrs. #DoYourJob
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs A truly lame justification for not doing your job.
@SenatorLankford So then put up legislation that changes the number of justices from nine to eight it's that simple. But in the mean time
@SenatorLankford the LEGISLATURE has determined that there are nine seats on the court so #DoYourJob
@SenatorLankford   Can't even come up with an original #strawman today? Propose an amendment or #DoYourJob
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs Then why are we paying nine on a yearly basis a wasted salary???Those years add up!!
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs Amazing the # of Americans who have not read the Constitution or try to define "Advice and Consent" broadly.
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs You're right the legislature has determined the court should have 9 justices.  So #DoYouJob all the rest are
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs excuse not to do what the LEGISLATURE has determined is necessary for the court to function. #DoYourJob
@SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs How about explaining why the senate repubs are not doing their jobs.
@no_Soy_De_Tii @SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs Typical response from a repub, you are excused.
@no_Soy_De_Tii @SenatorLankford @Senate_GOPs I thought I dismissed you?
