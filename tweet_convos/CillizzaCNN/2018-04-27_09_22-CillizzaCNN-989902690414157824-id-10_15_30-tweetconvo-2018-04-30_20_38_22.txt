I'm shocked Jake Tapper was outed today as the one who leaked the dossier. Just shocked. 
i think the most remarkable thing about the Menendez ethics letter is that it seems like basically everyone's assumption is that it's not going to be a factor in his likely re-election
court don't think so
Why this man is not in Prison is beyond me Bob Menendez is a crook we don't know why he was not prosecuted
I don’t disagree with the findings.  I wonder where the review and smack downs are for GOP misbehavior.  Policing only one side is how we got to a system without checks and balances.
With all the latest rounds of @GOP hanky-panky & financial scandals, it was about time a Democrat got caught playing fast and loose with the ethics codes. #BobMenendez
The courage of the other 93 is admirable.
