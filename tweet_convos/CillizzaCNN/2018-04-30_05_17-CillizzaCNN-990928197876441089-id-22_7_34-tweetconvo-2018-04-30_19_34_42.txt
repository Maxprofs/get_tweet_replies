Chris is nt a journalist Chris is merely an OP-ED writer His articles should be considered with the same grain of salt as Danielle Steele. CNN use to have someone monitoring Chris. When he had a bit too much they locked his keyboard away. Sadly they have cut back on staffing.
My whole point is, i dont consider his types journalist. They portray journalist, and in Chris's case, very poorly.
Hey Mr. Chris Cillizza: I have a question for you: Given that CNN didn’t even bother airing Mr. Trump’s rally in Michigan, what makes you feel entitled to comment on it?! I’ll wait... @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr
Chris, you, like your twin, Brian Stetler are a pumpkin with ears. Now do Michelle Wolf
The single most offensive #FakeNews shrill at king of #Fakenews @CNNPolitics: They're all anti-American and thus ALL offensive!
How does your head not explode?  My jaw hurts from clenching just reading this recap.
I appreciate CNN because if people tell me they like it, I know not to talk to them anymore.
How about brand new bs ?

Love it!
You are hysterical!!!!
This is one of your better ones. And lost in all the ruckus about the comedian at the correspondents dinner is how absolutely batshit crazy Trump was at this rally
I guess we are no longer buying used fighter jets and ships on eBay.
Brand New President??????
Why no mention of inciting violence against the press, the lock her up chants?
Do you have a problem with this?
Chris, that's some scary shit right there. The dementia and narcissism are deepening with every passing day. "Everyone is talking about it." We are screwed.
Good the rich are paying their fair share ... oh wait.
Clicked this article cuz I expected it to be dumb AF and was not disappointed. This makes u look as dumb as trump and as petty as Hillary.
