You must know the truth, Cillizza. When will you admit you were played by Clapper and Brennan? There never was
any legitimate reason to initiate
a counter-intelligence investigation into Trump's
campaign. The next question,
are you complicit with your traitorous friends?
You mean felonies.
While CNN was helping clapper with leaks!
thank you exactly what I’d been told
Self serving? Check out how many times Barry O. used the words I or me in just his 2011 SOTU address alone. Something like 115-120+ times.

Paperboy.
Does anyone even hear @CNN anymore? Not anyone with any intelligence anyways. @CNN depends on the dumb & uninformed, as Cummo said its our job 2 tell you what you need to hear, after that program, I shut you down.
Wow.  Hey everyone, this is what pathetic looks like.  Dude, you really need to rethink your life choices.  Good luck with the next decade chisel.
Breaking: Source claims @CillizzaCNN is a 'journalist'.  #FauxJournalism
Ya know I didn’t vote for him due to this video.  But I remember the reporter and that I did hear that in the fog of war after 9/11.  So. It wasn’t a lie necessarily completely. Ppl heard the truth.
Like CNN bribing Clapper when he was DNI
Or this
@CillizzaCNN calling the Trumpster self-serving .... LOL .... Pot meet fucking kettle
