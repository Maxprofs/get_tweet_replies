So now you are against going to Mars?
Can POTUS go first? It would be a great honor for him.
Mars ? How about clean drinking water in Flint, and working your way up to Mars
Good. Send him. Maybe Little Rocket Man has room on one of his launches.
Well, by all means, let us send him there
Go forth @realDonaldTrump
Leave now !
Good—-maybe he could be the first President to go there!!!!
Only if Trump goes first!
Is he volunteering?
I THINK @realDonaldTrump IS ALREADY LIVING ON MARS!!!
Wait - according to "Pump up the Volume," I was told: Mars Needs Women?

What time is his flight?
When is he leaving?
He can be the first one there!
For him YES

Let's not keep Mars waiting.  Please send @POTUS there immediately.
He's finally going home?
And we vote Trump should be the first to go!
Maybe #Trump could go on ahead to Mars and wait for us!
Can we send Trump first?
I see the makings of a deal.
Probably.
Go NOW.
I am so ready for him to spend the rest of his life eating shit potatoes. 

You first @realDonaldTrump
hahahahahahaha
Great. Let’s send Trump and all the white supremacists there.
@realDonaldTrump would be too scared. Bullies really are not that brave, that’s why they bully.
Send him.
#journalism maybe one day, but not today
Will you be joining him?

Why don’t you and he take a trip there and stay a while?
I am pretty sure he was thinking of the candy bar when he said that aloud. 
He said Mars, he means prison.
Elon...please send the orange ONE up next. 
It’s more like they want@him back
Is 'Mars' the name of a federal prison?
The Candy Man
Somewhere new to play golf.
Just go Trump. Just go.
He should volunteer first
Can we please send Trump there on a one way ticket first?
Can we ask him to please leave now?  We'll pay for a first class ticket.
CNN Fact Check: False
@RealDonaldTrump blew that money on the #GOPtaxscam and his Wall project
Can we just send him there?
