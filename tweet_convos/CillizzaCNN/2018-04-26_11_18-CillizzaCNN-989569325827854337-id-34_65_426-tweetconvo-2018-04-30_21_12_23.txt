Just like the sexual assaulter in the White House, another man of wealth & power who thinks he can do as he pleases to women.
Classic narcissistic behavior.
Yep. Doesn't think his actions were harmful or wrong and possibly feels he made a contribution. That's why he needs to go to prison.
A man was Lynch today.
No, his name is still Cosby.
Lynching is y’all thing
When will President Dennison pardon him?
That abdication flu is really getting around, no?
Kinda like Trump w/Mueller,  Cohen w/Trump, Ryan w/Trump, McConnell w/Trump, Hell, all repuglicans/Trump!
Fu..rget the victims, it's always just about"THEM"!
How do U spell NARCESSISM? 
Bet Ryan, McConnell & most Reps can spell it, Trump no!

Talk about the Perfect time 4 CHANGE!
Similar to Trump
Kinda sounds like @realDonaldTrump
Yes but I sense a pardon is coming.

I know your schtick these days is commenting on everyone's "apparent" intentions, emotions, thoughts, etc., but the man is going to die in prison. His punishment is coming soon.

You misspelled Potus' name, Chris
He thinks like CNN!
He yelled ”you asshole” to the prosecutor.
You seem to be under the mistaken impression that you are a journalist.
I like Cosby and sorry to hear the verdict. I am female and believe that most of this "me too" movement is the outcome of a culture that existed for many years (centuries/forever) BUT do you prosecute for actions that have been the "norm" all this time? I am not so sure.
Art.
Thank you @GloriaAllred
your buddy Bill Clinton should be next!!
Yea, there’s no way those jurors could have been wrong...we do have a perfect system...
lol how unsurprising. do we know what kind of sentencing range he is looking at?
10 years max.
Ok Chris what about that thing in the WH, why isn’t he charge with 20 women that he abuse.
He and Trump are cut from the same cloth.
He's no Bill Clinton, that's fer sure!
