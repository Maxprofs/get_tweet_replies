Remarkable: 6 of Menendez's Senate peers, 4 of whom serve on Foreign Relations w/ him, unanimously found him guilty of breaking federal law & Senate rules. 
Yet DOJ only got 2 of 12 jurors to convict.

Different standards?
.@pkcapitol How is that remarkable?  The standard is lower for the ethics committee... It's not Beyond a Reasonable Doubt.
@CillizzaCNN......I see Donald Trump deleted his tweet from last night telling people to watch him on Fox and Friends this morning. I am guessing there was a reason?? 
Menendez was banned from this year’s golf outing and he has to wear a MAGA hat in public for at least 8 hours.
And what will they do to Pruitt?
Sternly worded memo...
Double secret probation.
With what a stern ‘tsk, tsk! Shame on you!’? #CorruptionSucks
Who's the smartest man in Washington?
