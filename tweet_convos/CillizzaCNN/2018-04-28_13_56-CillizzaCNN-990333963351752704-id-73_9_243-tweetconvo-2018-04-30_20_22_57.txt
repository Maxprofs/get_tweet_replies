Do you really want to look like Tucker Carlson?
Youtube videos.  Will change your life and teach you that skill.

(that is how I learned)
Or: if you could tie a bow tie, perhaps you would also have a firmer grasp on your limitations
If you could tie a bow tie your content would still suck
I can help. Used to be the bow tie guy at Brooks Brothers.

Maybe you should hone your journalism skills first.
Cmon man. It’s an essential skill. Can you tie your shoes? It’s the same knot! Just put your shoe up to your throat and try it.
Um, you might want to look up the Sedaris story about that
Thought @CNN felt that way when they hired clapper and leaked like the Titanic
Glad you can’t!
So bourgeois... lol
It’s on YouTube. Easy
Buy a clip on and fake it
Chris, it is easier than it looks. Check on YouTube and go conquer!
It's a shoe-lace knot.
What are you, 12?
If you can tie your shoe, you can tie a bowtie. Have you heard of this thing called “google”?
you would be wrong.....
That’s what YouTube is for!!
Hit me up, Chris.....I'd be MORE willing to teach you....
Are you at the dinner?
I didn't think you'd need to wear a bow tie for a Michigan rally?
It’s actually step 4 in conquering the world !
You’re already a star Chris! 

You would rock a hand tied bow tie
You can conquer nothing.
YouTube
presumably, @TuckerCarlson can tie one.  you may want to rethink.
@realDonaldTrump not keen on bow ties but fancies running the World
Conquering the world requires less dexterity, and is a far better strategy for romantic success...:)
@TuckerCarlson
Don’t you get made fun of enough on @ThisShowStinks?
I think a bow tie would suit you! Go for it.
How Larry King of you to say ...
Ask Tucker Carlson for help........just kidding !
Oh heck just go with the clip on!
Such is your understanding of what it takes to be effective. Cilly boy
I have feeling this musing was inspired by tonight’s Dinner !
Here's how I do it:  I get my son to do it for me.
That would complete the Bill the science guy look.
Come here and let me do it for you :)
I’m sure you could find something on UTUBE to help you.
YouTube Chris. or DM me and I’ll come show you.
No prep school for you, huh?
You might want to talk to @TuckerCarlson about that
LOL  !
Gimme a break. You can't even tie your shoes.
Throw in a magic wand & you r good to go!
Have fun.  Don’t drink too much
Alas, we'll never know!
My Dad (long gone) was really clumsy. But he always knew how to tie a bow tie. So I’m sure you’ll manage too if you practice.
But here we are.
Thoughts on @JoyAnnReid and her apology?
Say hi to Sarah Huckabee Sanders for me.
Tucker said that and look where he ended up
It's magic . . .
You can do it. I have faith in you.
This guy?
YouTube, man, there’s hundreds of tutorials and it got me through it. Of course, I forget every time and have to relearn it.

You tube, lol.
Nah, lower your expectations. Look at Trump - you think he knows how to tie anything?
Actually really easy.  Check this out, good explanation.
It took me months of trying…
Go forth for Queen and country!
