In real news...Congrats to @RichardGrenell on his confirmation as Ambassador to Germany.
Reading all these Candyman comments from all these Xanax and Valium riddled liberals is freaking hilarious 
But yet nothing said about him while he served under Obama. It's good all of these things came out it proves more incompetence by the Obama administration.

And others call him "Candyman".
“Or, on the weekends really bigly, we call him Action Jackson”!
Damn Chris.  How do you get so cool?????
And we will remember how badly you treated this military officer who serves with honor. There will be no blue wave and this shameful CNN - DNC lynching is one of the main reasons.  #rememberronny
