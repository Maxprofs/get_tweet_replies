Much more serious than lying to Congress like Clapper did.
Get your news from another source than FauxNews !!! You’ll learn something actually !!!
We won’t overlook it. It’s just that the scandal will be eclipsed by the other sh** that’s being hurled at us.
#PruittLies #BootPruitt #PollutingPruitt @EPAScottPruitt
fire him
I hear you, but is anyone going to do anything about it?
liars are rock stars in this administration, and to Trump supporters
In other words: he’s a perfect fit for Trump’s team.
Do any Trumpites tell the truth? What a cesspool in DC.  Shameful!

You work for @CNN
They ALL lie on tv
Why does this man still have a job?
Will he impeached and removed as can be done with executive officials?
Do you think there will be any consequences for his actions?  Unfortunately I do not - we are in the Trump era.
Lock him up! Lock him up!
Just another Thursday!
If the @POTUS can lie with impunity why can’t his Cabinet? @PressSec ?
He has gained weight, hasn't he?
Lied to the country
#FirePruittNow and take @realDonaldTrump with him
I trust nothing you say & aren’t interested enough in your opinions anymore to open your articles. You’re the worst reporter at cnn.
Yeah. The MSM and their many panels seem to be so distracted by Trump rambling on Fox (which he did for over a year at his rallies) that they forgot this little point
The news does everyday.  Its not unusual to see lies on T.V.
Oh gosh! Somebody in politics telling a lie! That never happens!
Says somebody who works for CNN. The irony is endless.
Malibu Rum
Nor that James Clapper lied to congress!
Did he wait for Cosby annoncemt as a smoke screen?
@CNN does that every day and you seem perfectly happy for us to be overlookin' dat!
is he done yet?
