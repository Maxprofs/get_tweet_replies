He was off all of last week, and alone on Saturday. At least he got her a "beautiful" card. it's no $130K


He could order something on Amazon.
H couldn't pick something up at the Mar-a-lago gift shop or something?  He's there like every freaking weekend!
"Busy, busy, busy - so, listen, they're calling me right now, gotta go tee off, see you."
Can't go on Amazon and order after bsshing them repeatedly.
Not even a little something from the Pro Shop?
He cudda gotter a link to the archive of CNN articles! The best present for anyone is #StarveCNN!
I can guess what she wants him to give her...
Is he working from the premise that birthday presents must be chosen & purchased on the day of?!  Even Facebook gives you a few days notice.
No, not ok.
And he wonders why he can’t get his wife to hold his hand.
I’m sure his interview on @foxandfriends was a very heartfelt
He's such a romantic.
All the sh*t he puts her through. 
All the money he has.
All the resources he has to get her a gift without actually having to do it himself.
All the time he has to tweet and call Fox and watch cable news.
All the time he spends golfing.

No gift for his wife because he's busy?
Must have cut into his TV watching time...Grow up.
Translation:
With the recent proof about that night in Russia, she is so angry & not following my orders to never refuse me, so she doesn't deserve a gift!
But I have always had to to sleep with other women.
I guess he never heard of on line shopping.
But he has time to go through thousands of pages of docs siezed from Michael Cohen.
family is always first. #forshame
What about during Executive time?
#FakeMarriage ....what a SHAM
