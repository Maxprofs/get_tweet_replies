Chris, Not big fan of CNN but this article is hilarious. Every time you write i read it begin to end. Good job!
He wasn’t even at the rally. And he didn’t even watch it on tape after the fact. According to his article he clearly states that he READ THE TRANSCRIPT of the speech which means he relied on someone else’s watching it. HOW IS THAT GOOD JOURNALISM?! I’ll wait...
Here is a quote from your other article regarding Ms. Wolf’s routine: “Most journalists in the room -- and I was among them -- were largely quiet during Wolf's speech...” WHY DID YOU WRITE AN ARTICLE ABOUT TRUMP’S RALLY?! You weren’t there. You only read a transcript of it!
Reading these quotes and reminding myself this is supposed to be the current American president.
Clean water ? He says that in a state where Flint is in crisis from their "clean" water
This list says a whole lot more about you than POTUS... you may want to see someone about this delusion...
He’s right

Like being racist and bombing Syria and being the Israeli's god boy ? Oh those are definitely good things! keep up man!
Can you break down how cnn makes its money. What advertisers spend the most, other ways cnn makes profit. Then once we know how you guys make that money how you cover those groups that give you money. Seems like u guys have a narrow range on what & how you cover news.
That’s going to look great on the Trump Memorial
We get it, you don’t like him. Hope you didn’t take much time writing this. What a joke.
On world stage USA is a disgrace. trump is an old manic embarrassment and ignorant beyond words. USA is unraveling for all to see. Shameful.
You aren’t.
That’s a step above what you and CNN are doing...
Like what? Beating up brown people?
