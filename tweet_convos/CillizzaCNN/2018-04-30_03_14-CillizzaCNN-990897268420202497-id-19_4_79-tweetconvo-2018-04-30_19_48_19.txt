Where is the list? https://twitter.com/cillizzacnn/status/990679661968535552 …
The fact people are hysterical over a comic and not trump’s hysterical lie-fest is the problem
@ChrisCuomo
Also list the abortion jokes at the WHCD,those were hilarious!
No talk of the Prime Minister of Israel having hard evidence that Iran is cheating on the nuclear deal? I mean he did just hold a live press conference but we're going to talk about some make-believe list
Take your time, "New" Day has been wall to wall on #WHCD all morning
Good.

Keep taking the bait.

;-)
To be fair, the only people watching that campaign style rally are people that already love and adore Trump. They don’t care about his lies. You can literally show them a list and they’ll just say it’s lies from the “Mainstream liberal media”
Stayed tuned for the latest spin from @CNN brought to you by @CillizzaCNN, who is trying to save his ass.

Wouldn’t this be bullying?
The accusation made by Chris Cilizza that Michelle Wolf acted like a bully at WHCD was stunning. Especially for him.
Yeah, "edited". We have no doubt.
You have one week...
You’re just gonna post a dumpster fire meme
Getting after it at a steady pace
