Seems higj
So the number is up since the last poll!!
Why are you surprised ? @CillizzaCNN and @CNN have been pushing the same narrative since the election. When you spend 24/7 trashing the duly elected President with lies and worse, what do you think the effect is ?
The 3% of people who have a great deal of confidence in elected officials are the donor class.
Sleezza, you can thank the Clintons and  Obamas for that #FakeNewsCNN stat
No surprise.  Best interest of we the people is to get stuff done.  E.g. - my congressman @GerryConnolly spends a lot of time pointing out hypocrisy and celebrating interparty animosity and feigns surprise when agreement cannot be made.  We need adults in positions of leadership.
That seems high.
It can’t be that high.
The public shows good judgment.
That's a lot higher than the numbers for #MSM #FakeNews
That would be the Democrats...which is #cnn
Even less in the media - your bias to the left is obscene - Pravda looks balanced in retrospect.
All 3% are probably family members of government officials.
Did you ask anyone who DOESN'T live in a trailer park?
That means the media must be at 1% or less.
Too high. @CNN is probably continuing to skew it's polls to the pro-government side.

#StarveCNN
As high and unrealistic as this number is, I bet even a skewed poll of CNN's trustworthiness would be even lower. Can you get negative poll numbers? #StarveCNN
Who are these ill-informed 3% ?
It must be Trump's fault, right?
Seems high to me...
Clearly the 3% were politicians or their families!
Sounds kind of high.
Keep reporting Chrissie. That 3 will be down to 2 in no time.
Yes. Meaning the Jeff Flakes, Maxine Waters, Warrens, Pelosis, the MCCains, the Ryans, and the McConnels of the “elected” world. Actually throw in Barry O as well. Exact reason President Trump got elected and the exact reason we Americans see his agenda challenged at every turn.
Pitiful, just pitiful. But it’s true
Even in a tweet there is room for the source of a poll and when it was taken, and +/- error. You know this better than most. It's all the more important because you are a journalist.
That’s rich, since the vote - or think they vote - entirely in their own interests
Agreed wow I thy thought it was lower like 0%
Surprised, that high?
I'm surprised it's that high to be honest. Look at the clusterf*** that is our current Congress.
Seems high to me.
That seems a little high Chris.
Because 97% percent of the time our elected politicians make decisions that will “hopefully keep them in the club”! They’re in it for themselves!  Why are the Obama’s and the Clinton’s millionaires now?   Nice club if you can get in and stay in!!! Add the Kenedy’s, & Cuomo’s too!
What are those 3% smoking? I want some...
This is disturbing,  as I work in public service.  What's projected onto elected officials is often projected onto public service workers. 

Government is not bad, but elected officials like @realDonaldTrump , @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr and @EPAScottPruitt destroy faith in govt.

2% Trust @CNN
Thanks Obama!
This explains Obama/Trump voters. Faith in our government is so low there are segment of people that are willing to just try something new.
Seems high
Repeal Citizens United.
Any takes on Reid?

No?

Ah.
Wow, hard to believe (except I’m NOT in that 3%) lol
That's 2.9% more than expected.
The swamp is real.
amazing it's so high, eh?
Those people are stupid.
