Is he being paid by democrats? Why would he be invited to this. Everyday he is on cnn. Stormy had a one night stand with Trump 12 years ago.
@MichaelAvenatti also photo bombed @KellyannePolls. It was hilarious!
The whole event was a disgrace. Not one moment of intellect. I guess all you fake journalists felt right at home...
hair v no hair?
Crowds?  most Americans aren’t there.
The media has helped create a circus, we now have in our political world. You've spent more time talking about a comedian  then a deranged individual known as the president going completely unhinged and threatening a congressman.
Tester obviously was misinformed and said terrible things. Threatening he re election is no big desl
Tester repeated allegations that he heard along with 20 people plus, has said the same thing about Ronnie Jackson. He could have stuck it out but he didn't. The president was crazy last night he was unhinged and was an embarrassment to all of us.
Face time on cable news = face time where newsies gather?
... it's true!... she's the leaker-in-chief!!!
They're planning a remake of "Moonlighting"?
Avenatti might do something worthwhile for the country so his future will be bright, Kellyanne not so much.  What’s the connection?
Sleazebag lawyer and Propaganda Barbie?
Go figure.
Fake news
Why Kellyanne?  Attendees there are not vacuous fans, was it an irony, or in the contrast of Avenatti?
Professional liar / Political savvy lawyer.
