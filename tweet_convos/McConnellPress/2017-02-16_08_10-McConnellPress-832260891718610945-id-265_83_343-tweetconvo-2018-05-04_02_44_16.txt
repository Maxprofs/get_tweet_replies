Don't talk about "unnecessary delay" until you have confirmed Merrick Garland. #hypocrite #GOPshame #remembergarland
the POTUS presser was a chaotic rant. How can you stand by that? How exactly do you sleep at night?
8 years of you NOT doing your job. Sit down and shut up
#45IsUnhinged #SoldYourSoulsTo45 #LiarInChief
why complain when that was your strong suit during the last 8 yrs  man. obstruct & delay. you forget but we don't!
stop whining Mitch your a freaking adult who scams the government
do you really think people forgot you saying you wouldn't give Obama anything?
"Unnecessary delay" was, like,a week? You played stall ball on Garland for 9 months? What gall.
Fck you Bitch McConnell, you hypocrite, liar & dishonest turtle. U Queen of Obstruction- STFU. 
the king of obstruction who taught the Democrats well
you are unnecessary. #corrupt
You need to stop with Your Alt Facts AKA #Fakenews get back in your shell   #Corrupt 

#TheResistance
McConnell unaware how embarrassing he's become as Senator 
Does Not Represent the People
@McConnellPress You are such a  hypocite. Remember  what you said about President  Obama's administration.

Not unnecessary-abysmally unqualified. Makes you look like a fool & Rs un-reelectable.
, has he turned in all his paperwork to the court yet that is due by Tuesday will you review it or ignore it
Hey @SenateMajLdr If scrutiny is unnecessary, then you don't have a job to do.  Retire, Go to KY, have a glass of coal water, and rest.
"unnecessary delay" was your modus operandi for 8 years, but NOW it bothers you?
Ideological misfit
YOU were dragging YOUR feet.  Get moving or get out of the way!
Glad you've got such respect for your colleagues.
You are nothing but an obstructionist and traitor.
No Unnecessary Delay STOP LYING proof 

#GOP #Corrupt
Delays are necessary when you have the most unqualified cabinet in history
and your Merrick delay was necessary??
, not unnecessary at all. Some senators are just actually listening to their constituents. #resist #persist
It was very necessary. This is a terrible choice!
watch your wallet.
asking questions and expecting truthful answers is not an unreasonable delay
you are such a whinner!
Senate D's were exercising the constitutional right to delay that you cherish so much. Pract what you preach.
Know that we know. You care for nothing but power. You have no principles. Or heart
We were in the midst of a crisis and you let people suffer miserably. You were like Hoover but with intent
Your cluelessness is breathtaking. You purposely hurt people in your bid ruin Obama
You mean like the unnecessary delays on 100's of Mr. Obama's nominees?
one more brick in the cabinet of Kadicocracy
I have a special finger for you.
@McConnellPress @RepMickMulvaney After an unnecessary delay, we are still waiting for #MerrickGarland
Terrible
Merrick Garland
dear turtle faced white supremacist, White power!
please don't comment on delays, you spent 8 years delaying! Hypocrite! #stolenseat #resist
Thank you. Another 1%er Trump appointee to RIP us off. Crappy swamp draining in Washington.
Is it unnecessary to do the best to ensure that qualified, appropriate nominees get confirmed? Don't think so
Says the hypocrite who had several unnecessary delays during Obama's 8 years.
Is your aide bored with nothing to do?
After 8 yrs of unnecessary delay the Republicans have the audacity to whine the hold up of unqualified noms.
when he tries to destroy the economy soc sec & medicare reps will be held responsible #TheResistance
@sendavidperdue @SenatorIsakson Hmmm, remember all the obstructive delays you Reps have done? &Im independent
don't forget @SenJohnMcCain  didn't like @RepMickMulvaney either!
The Democrats are a shameful disgrace to America.
.@SenateMajLdr @RepMickMulvaney You keep forgetting: You never get to complain about delays ever again. No worries, we'll keep reminding you
The only ones creating "unnecessary delays" are the GOP. Like with Merrick Garland? Remember him, CecilTURDle McConnell?
Unlike the "unnecessary delay" of President Obama's Supreme Court nominee! Turtle you are a despicable human
you mran unnecessary delays like Merrick Garlands hearong/vote u hippocrite. #Annoyed
NO ONE is buying your mult tweets on conf delays. No matter how many X you say it, you're still a hypocrite!
Mitch the obstructionist is concerned about delays? Not the same Mitch we had the past 8 years! Hypocrite!!!
you invented obstruction. Obstruction is for wimps. We will expose, try, and hang your traitor Trump
I find your constant barrage of hyper partisanship tiring. Just do what's right.
Do your job and start an investigation. As far as I am concerned you are ALL Russian collaborators
I still can't believe you have the audacity to continue to complain about delays. Hypocrite!
@SenateGOP republicans are embarrassed by ur (lack of) leadership- work for #AmericanValues or get out of the way!
@McConnellPress @RepMickMulvaney unnecessary delays.... that's YOUR SPECIALTY
Garland was delayed, ACA delayed all because of your ignorant refusal to do the will of the people! Divest.
do your job! I want to know if Trump and his administration compromise our country!
Another unnecessary delay. Should have more delay on Flynn. But welcome to new @GOP coverup for @POtus
Another gator!

after unnecessary delay and obstruction from the GOP Obama still more beloved than any of them
Dems close ranks and almost always vote unanimous. keep the @SenateGOP in line.  Republicans always their own worst enemy
@McConnellPress @RepMickMulvaney  ALL OF YOU NEED TO STOP HIM. THIS LUNATIC IS GOING TO GET US KILLED
@McConnellPress @RepMickMulvaney are you listening to this lunatic? He is dangerous and ALL elected need to stop him.
we are getting tired of your hum drum rhetoric, perhaps spice it up with a swear word once and a while.
Again, maybe if these appointees had been properly vetted there wouldn't be so much delay.
so buckle up buttercup-you know what's even worse than straight up racism? TREASON
WE THE PEOPLE think you trying to overlook #moscowmike speaks to a pathological UNAMERICAN illegal coverup
Newsflash: using the phrase "unnecessary delay" is going to come back and defeat you #trumprussia #russiagate
@McConnellPress @RepMickMulvaney you are not one to talk about stonewalling anyone. Stand on your own 2 feet.
because of those reasons, if you think there was an "unnecessary delay" you also show your incompetence
he shows a lack of scientific understanding and ignorance when he states climate change isn't a risk.
he wants to defund Planned Parenthood which shows a gross lack of knowledge in healthcare.
Thank you Mr Leader, keep it moving!
he failed to pay taxes for an employee for 4 years. shows bad management skills. 2
well that is bad news. he doesn't care about the health of the people in this country. 1
You're unnecessary Mitch
like the 8 Yrs you stalled it? Retire old man! Hypocrite of the highest order
Complaining when you, your Republican friends got paid for doing nothing the last 6 Damn years?
You continue to put unvetted people in the Whitehouse. You all can't get anymore corrupt. God will judge you.
You lost credibility when you covered up the Russian hacking intelligence. You broke your oath. RESIGN!!!
they have a right to question same as you and your party did
Can he get POTUS taxes and independent investigation with subpoena powers?
1more fox in the hen house. Hope you enjoy your $ when the country goes down the tubes, and history remembers
@twright55 @RepMickMulvaney unnecessary, yes. But they are in resistance mode. Good luck with that!
Not unnecessary delay but due diligence and representing the concerns of informed citizens
Just because it did not go exactly how you wanted does not make it "unnecessary". #resist
Like your 8 years of Delays and Obstruction while Obama was POTUS? Hipocrit!
always obsessed with all that senate D
I don't often prescribe online Mitch,  but for you -->Bull test and an 8 ball .  Get a move on... Jeeeeez @SenateMajLdr @RepMickMulvaney
I noticed an unnecessary delay in confirming Merrick Garland, too.  Stop being a hypocrite.
you and your fellow republicans are the only D's in  the senate.
"Those derned Democrats are acting just like Us, only more growed up.  Ayyyyyyyuuuup!"  #FixedIt #resign
SO MUCH DEMOCRAT BUTT HURT IN THIS THREAD.
DEMOCRATS ARE THE PARTY OF OBSTRUCTIONISTS, SCREECH BI-PARTISAN WHEN THEY ARE IN POWER THEN BLOCK WHEN NOT!
sorry MMc you spelled a word wrong. U incorrectly added "un" to necessary. Must be that sad pubic ed u had.
after unnecessary delay justice garland is still waiting you hypocrite.
oh look who's talking!

you built your career on obstruction. You reap what you sow.
The term "leader" is a stretch applied to what you actually do.... unless leaders inspire people in retreat.
hey bruh, stop making excuses and get things done!
Trump enablers. Liars. Traitors.  won't forget.
You are going to answer for this.  How much is Putin paying you? http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/2/16/1634379/-Mitch-McConnell-joins-Jason-Chaffetz-in-refusing-to-provide-a-check-on-Trump?detail=facebook …
@McConnellPress @RepMickMulvaney When is the probe on Watergate2. Potentially???
Please for once in your miserble life please investigate this Trump scandal and do what is right.
Is that like the delay that the gop senate has been doing for the last 7 years. Remember scotus pick. Silly
trea·son - (trēzən/noun)
the crime of betraying one's country. 

Appoint an independent investigator now!
Necessary
your Bible must have "hypocrisy" cut out. Which version is that? GOP Standard Version, I guess
After all, who knows more about unnecessary delay than you?
- Says the king of "unnecessary delay". I'm old enough to remember your pure obstructionism under Obama.
Unnecessary? No, they care about WHO has our best interest. It's clear that GOP doesn't.
it never ceases to amaze me the lengths you and your minions will go to hold onto pwr #electionfraudistreason
#WhatDid*45Know & #WhenDidHeKnowIt? Look into it. #YourLastTerm
Oh Great another swamp sycophant who will loot poor people. Republicans only love 1%. #TheResistance
After unnecessary delay Mitch McConnell resigned.
Will he recommend cutting Medicare, like he suggested in his hearing?
@McConnellPress @RepMickMulvaney Oh goodie! We have another unqualified puppet in the Cabinet.
Unnecessary delay? Hahaha. YOU refused to have a vote on Judge Garland,. You're a disgrace
You didn't need to add "After unnecessary delay". It's irrelevant and shows poor class on your part.
@EllenMorris1222 @RepMickMulvaney Unnecessary delay????? Hahahaha! Partisan pimp.
DEMOCRATS ARE THE PARTY OF OBSTRUCTIONISTS, SCREECH BI-PARTISAN WHEN THEY ARE IN POWER THEN BLOCK WHEN NOT!
another sad day for America
RESIGN TRAITOR . !!!!!!!! .

You have an unnecessary delay in investigating Trump's ties to Russia!  Where is the investigation?
goodie goodie another addition to the GOP swamp getting close to overflowing
#worthless Senator from Kentucky.
I want to know more about your health insurance coverage
@SpeakerRyan  You vote for non sense because you ARE non sense.
. Comrade McConnell you are a traitorous hypocritical liar!
@McConnellPress @RepMickMulvaney F-off McConnell
Let the stealing of senior citizens begin
You would know all about unnecessary delays and obstruction since you wrote the book on it.
You delayed everything under Obama and you deserve the same Non respect. DO YOUR JOB LYING MITCH!! #DoYourJob
You have the audacity to talk about 'unnecessary delay?" ACA reform. Merrick Garland. Obstructionist spasms from a dying party
Unnecessary my ass.
Are you so blinded by your own hubris that you don't recognize the hypocrisy of your words?
and John McCain. War hero. And republican.
Not at all unnecessary. Trump's picks are highly suspect and largely unqualified. Scrutiny is a must.
After unnecessary delay by @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump has been investigated for colluding with Russia.




I have never seen a turtle take on the attributes of a weasel. Thanks for the mental! #TrumpImpeachmentParty




vetting Cabinet members thoroughly is not unnecessary. Look at Pudzer.


shut down government twice.
LET'S IGNORE THE RUSSIANS LET'S IGNORE THE LACK OF INTEGRITY BY THE REPUBLICANS. We need to accept this huh?
Says the man who spent the last 8 years doing everything possible to create unnecessary delays.
stop whining, hypocrite
keep up the good work and please keep you people in line Graham, McCain especially they need to fade away
And Collins a no on Pruitt. SMH
Remember: 

2018 and 2020

@SenateMajLdr  FULLY SUPPORTS Trump and his Russian Connections.

@RepMickMulvaney
I solemnly swear  to uphold the laws and NEVER say a negative word against Mother Russia.
#TraitorInChief 
You'd know about "unnecessary delay" wouldn't you
so incredibly sorry to hear this. Too bad you voted party over country Mitch
isn't it time congress acted like adults, this excessive delay is obscured.
