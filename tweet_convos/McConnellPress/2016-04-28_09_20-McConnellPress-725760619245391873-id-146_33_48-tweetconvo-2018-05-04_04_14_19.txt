@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress Why don't you #DoYourJob and give Garland a hearing? #Hypocrite #SCOTUS #SCOTUSNominee
@livingjustified @SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress Why should he? Who wants Garland? The liberals?  He is anti-2nd Amendment. @realDonaldTrump
@CAoutcast Because it's constitutional
@livingjustified Give us a break. What has really been constitutional in the last 7+ years?
@CAoutcast wtf are you talking about?!
He's anti-2nd Amendment. Let the next pres chose.
Actually looked at your profile. Don't tweet me anymore. I don't debate with name-calling Trump supporters.
What an arrogant prick!1) u start chipping away @ the 2nd amendment u might as well take the whole thing. 2)U need 2 b on a
.@SenateMajLdr Why the hell should Democrats be the only ones working? You've waved your right to confirm Garland. Tick tock tick tock...
@Emmett_Stone @SenateMajLdr Problem is the Democrats r causing all the issues that have made the U.S. unrecognizable. Just a matter of time.
@CAoutcast @SenateMajLdr The country has voted for a democrat the last two POTUS elections. The GOP has become the White Nationalist party.
@Emmett_Stone @SenateMajLdr Ahh, no because the @GOP has sided with the globalists. Their power & money r more important than us.
@SenateMajLdr There is absolutely no reason for Republican Senators 2 deny Judge Garland the basic courtesy of a hearing & a vote.#DoYourJob
I love how you ignore how much more bills the GOP have blocked that could have helped us
because it was gonna be a lost for the NRA. They're going for everything, even if it's a buck and the GOP helps
and once for all, stop with the paranoia that goverment will take your guns, moron. Regulations like the ones for alcohol
You mean like #ScotusNominee ? #DoYourJob hold a hearing. Have a vote. Don't be a hypocrite.
Interpretation: "Get off your fat butts and work for the people who elected you, bitches !"
confirm SCOTUS nominee
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress You're telling Democrats to do their job?! Why don't you #DoYourJob and give Garland a hearing! #SCOTUS
the time to not allow Bill Clinton into the White House take a vote make the law enforce it. It would be an "American Shame"
@SenateMajLdr Still losing to the minority!  You are a primary reason why the GOP is in such chaos.
@SenateMajLdr Filibustering is acting.  Refusing to even consider Garland is not.  #DoYourJob
@husband_anon @SenateMajLdr I think they need to WAIT until the next president is elected.  Then make a decision. #NoToLiberalParty
@CAoutcast @SenateMajLdr why?  If they don't like Garland, then reject him. Why does the nominator matter in the decision making?
Consider #MerrickGarland #DoYourJob
so it's ok for you to fillabuster when your in the minority & won't hold hearings on Supreme Court appointees #Hypocrite
how about you do your job and hold a hearing for the supreme court nominee
your lips are moving so you're obviously lying.
#DoYourJob
And here's a message to you and your GOP colleagues: Do your job. Confirm Merrick Garland. And stop being hypocrites. #scotus
#DoYourJob ? Wow! You have no ability. At least they're filibustering. Do your job on SCOTUS. Now!
Republican weasels cave in to Fascist Pig Trump
@realSpencer Mitch thinks he's really clever 
How do u like them nowNo really, it's time for u to retire. U R taking too much power from the people.
ahhh you mean they read the gop dirty tricks bill? trump has a package for you too, when ryan is done. On your knees turtle
gop screws over Veterans. Once damaged good, Veterans are thrown to garbabe pile. it's the gop plan
When did you forget you WORK FOR THE PEOPLE?
the irony of you telling anyone to do their job. #SCOTUSnominee
@SenateMajLdr if you did your job you wouldn't have Donald Trump!
@SenateMajLdr Hello my Senate, there one of your citizen lewis in jail in DRCONGO. PLEASE do something. Kabila will kill him.do somethingUSA
@SenateMajLdr You're a coward that supports Trump's racism, bigotry & misogyny.  #ExMajorityLeader
@SenateMajLdr Where do u get the balls 2 pull the "obstructionist" card!? U and ur party ARE REFUSING TO VOTE on #SCOTUSnominee #VoteThemOut
.@SenateMajLdr Really don't understand what the rush?  Garland is anti-2nd Amendment.
@SenateMajLdr http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/us/politics/for-merrick-garland-and-republicans-a-tango-of-praise-and-rejection.html?&hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news …  Vote now on Merrick Garland.
@SenateMajLdr DO YOUR JOB? HOW IRONIC... LMAO #Garland
@POTUS was elected and RE elected, yet you still refuse to meet and confirm Supreme Court nominee. #DoYourJob @SenateMajLdr

@SenateMajLdr Pretty hilarious that you are telling people to do their job. #doYOURjob #DontThrowStonesIfYouLiveInAGlassHouse #SCOTUS
.@SenateMajLdr A total of 469 seats in the U.S. Congress (34 Senate seats and all 435 House seats) are up for election on November 8, 2016.
@SenateMajLdr Why don't you and yours #DoYourJob! #Advise&consent, Supreme Court Nominee needs a HEARING! #RepublicanObstruction must stop!
@SenateMajLdr What's going on Mitch?  You've been quiet.  Have you been obstructing things at home in your garage? Your bowel, perhaps?
@SenateMajLdr tell me will the rhinos in the Republican Party finally start fighting for conservative principles? Or is this a ruse?
@SenateMajLdr Why are we giving Iran money for anything when we don't have enough money for ourselves? The US needs help. Getting angrier.
.@SenateMajLdr Why don't u #doYourJob and hold hearings for a SCOTUS nominee?
@SenateMajLdr You are actually supporting Trump??  Do you have any idea how many members of your own party you just alienated?
@SenateMajLdr There's more than enough blame 4 both parties. Get vote for SCOTUS & stop being a tattle tale!!
@SenateMajLdr #DoYourJob #scotus
@SenateMajLdr do your job, fuck faced turtle fucker.
@SenateMajLdr So you think this is funny?  Is this turtle humor?  Open your mouth, I need to shit, you toilet turtle, you :D.
@SenateMajLdr Do you make all your impo(r)tent speeches to an empty chamber, idiot?
@SenateMajLdr McConnell says " My GOP Club is my obsession and Americans will be the causalities"
@SenateMajLdr Love the hypocrisy on filibustering. Hello? SCOTUS.nom.
@SenateMajLdr Filibusters are allowed by the Constitution; blocking hearings for SCOTUS nominees is not. #DoYOURJob
@litdreamer @SenateMajLdr Keep up the blocking until we get a new leader in office. Personally, it's the right thing to do.
@CAoutcast @SenateMajLdr No, it's not. And it's unconstitutional.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress yawn..DO YOUR JOB! GO TRUMP!
@SenateMajLdr you don't love America. You love lining your pockets.
@SenateMajLdr  I see through your reluctance to do your job.  This is what you believe, is the only way to get Republicans to the poles.
@SenateMajLdr How do you like the dose of Karma Trump nomination brings?
@SenateMajLdr Seriously?  Maybe when you do your job on SCOTUS and give Garland a vote!
@SenateMajLdr So your plan is to what? Wait for Trump to nominate Judge Judy? #DoYOURJob
@SenateMajLdr Hey Mitch!  Looks like its finally down to Trump and Clinton!  You still want to obstruct the #SCOTUSnominee this year?
.@SenateMajLdr This BS is WHY Trump is your nominee-you've done nothing while blaming everyone else for inaction. Get out your resume.
@SenateMajLdr
@SenateMajLdr Did not the Reagan Admin sells arms to #Iran without congressional consent?
@SenateMajLdr yeah and u do nothing
@SenateMajLdr #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr dumb and dumber
@SenateMajLdr enjoy life
@SenateMajLdr Oh please. That hash tag is against your party, who REFUSES to work. Don't try to spin it. Pathetic and embarrassing.
@SenateMajLdr Mitch, just resign already.
@SenateMajLdr you need to #DoYourJob and vote Garland and the deal has passed.
@SenateMajLdr You first.  #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr and you do your fucking job instead of blocking every single thing that is good for the middle class, asstwat
@SenateMajLdr You want the Democrats to work but do nothing about Republicans doing what??They get paid for that??Disgusting. Help our USA!
@SenateMajLdr lol.  That's funny.. What do you think, people are stupid..
@SenateMajLdr Why? they know you and the rest of the RINO's will give them more than they ask for- YOUR Mantra!
@SenateMajLdr you telling someone to do their job? LOL LOL What have you done lately? #lazyfuck
@SenateMajLdr #DoYourJob #DoYourJob #DoYourJob #DoYourJob #DoYourJob #DoYourJob #DoYourJob #DoYourJob #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr ... dude ... I know you are attempting to understand the meaning of the hashtag #DoYourJob ... filibustering is not against...
@SenateMajLdr ... the constitution ... nullifying a President's ability to nominate a Supreme Court Judge by stating clearly that it doesn't
@SenateMajLdr ... matter who they nominate, we will not duly proceed with the process of hearing the nominee out to see if they should be...
@SenateMajLdr ... confirmed is against the constitution. The constitution's the minimum of your job description and the promises you make to
@SenateMajLdr ... your constituents the add-on to your job description. So as the hashtag clearly states; #DoYourJob.
@SenateMajLdr ... sidenote: worst thing u can do's promise your constituents something going against the constitution. #ConflictingInterests
@SenateMajLdr ... another hashtag worth noting that's definitely fitting the occasion is #PlayByTheRules.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress hahaha a hilarious topic for you, of all people, to talk about #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr Are you really telling ANYONE to do their job? Hypocrite. Garland deserves conformation.
@SenateMajLdr note to fledgling comedians: don't repeat punch line: "do your job". Also, when speaking to empty chamber add canned laughter.
@SenateMajLdr Perhaps you didn't get the memo, but you have been banned from using the hashtag  #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr   The expense of hurting the American people. SHAME ON YOU!!
@SenateMajLdr  & was pregnant I would sue your ass for dragging your feet on this emergency. Once again your obstructing President Obama at
@SenateMajLdr  Now your taking a week off & your not going to address this for another few weeks?  This is shameful. If my daughter got Zika
@SenateMajLdr  There are already 900 cases of the virus in our country & many are pregnant woman. These babies may be born with brain damage
@SenateMajLdr  the Zika health crisis in out country. President Obama & the CDC asked for money at least 6 weeks ago. You have done nothing
@SenateMajLdr  How can you stand on the Senate Floor & lie to the American people?  You have No morals or values. Why haven't you addressed
@SenateMajLdr  Sounds like something the GOP has been doing last 8 years!
@SenateMajLdr didn't u guys do that a lot the past eight years u guys set such a bad example must have rubbed off
@SenateMajLdr Oh the irony of YOU telling anyone to do their job. Maybe if you all stopped acting like spoiled children? #partypoliticssuck
@SenateMajLdr .YOU'VE DONE NOTHING FOR OVER 7 YRS & NOW YOU HAVE THE NERVE TO BLAST THE #DEMS? SCUMBAG!! #GOPLoser
@SenateMajLdr I wish you could understand how hilarious this is to us, Mitch.  This really has lightened my mood, you hypocrite.
@SenateMajLdr you really didn't think when you started tweeting today, did you Mitch?
@SenateMajLdr False face must hide what the false heart doth know.Macbeth.
@SenateMajLdr How about you do YOUR job and hold a hearing for Merrick Garland? #DoYourJob #MerrickGarland #SupremeCourt
@SenateMajLdr This is comical coming from the obstruction king!
@SenateMajLdr Mitch, you couldn't get anything done in the minority and can't in the majority. What good are you? #DoYourJob on #SCOTUS
@SenateMajLdr Flashing that standard Republican upturned thin lipped sly self satisfied smirk. You guys gotta learn dat or you naturals?
@SenateMajLdr Mitch, no. #DoYourJob is all about you, honey. Wear it. Own it. Sit in it. Step in it. Looks good on you. Fits like a glove
@SenateMajLdr #DoYourJob How did you miss a serial child rapist right under your nose?
@SenateMajLdr are you kidding telling anyone to do their job?  Supreme Court nominee ring any bells?
@SenateMajLdr   Stop blaming Dems-  you have been stalling on SCOTUS vetting for months vet managed to fit in Spring Break.  UR No Leader
@SenateMajLdr  Who are you to tell anyone else to #DoYourJob? #SCOTUS
@Lady_Barlow Yeah #traitor @SenateMajLdr you are the problem and the solution is to retire NOW
@SenateMajLdr stop adding unrelated policy amendments to appropriation bills.  #knowyourjob #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr You just used the #DoYourJob hashtag. Look at you.
@SenateMajLdr vote up/down on Obama's Supreme Coutt nomination. Everything else is Moit.
@SenateMajLdr And you refuse to give Merrick Garland a hearing because you ::think:: WH will turn red in November. You are wrong #DoYourJob
@SenateMajLdr I'm positive you will fold like a cheap suit if DEMS offer a trade 4 their #SCOTUS nominee.
@SenateMajLdr   You are a wimp.  Step up and take control of the Senate.   Dems put a garden hose across the sidewalk & U can't get past it.
@SenateMajLdr NO! #IranDeal scam to fund their war against the west. @POTUS forever has #SuckerTattoo on his forehead for that one
@SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP Put on your big boy pants and change the rules to 51 and pass them
@SenateMajLdr this from one of the worst obstructionists if ALL times.
@SenateMajLdr you wouldn't know the truthfulness it but you.
@SenateMajLdr #Senate #Republicans won't vote on a hearing for a man profoundly qualified to serve on the Supreme Court. #DoYOURJob
@SenateMajLdr want my respect ... take RAPAEL EDWARD ass down! Get @jasoninthehouse CHAFFETZ on bat phone as VPOTUS w/@realDonaldTrump POTUS

@SenateMajLdr Stand strong and let them filibuster to Hell freezes over
@SenateMajLdr Excellent time to force Obama to veto Obamacare's repeal, but that requires a sack.
@SenateMajLdr LMAO AT BatShit Crazy as Ted Crucifer Republicans! This election cycle hasn't registered yet I take it?????
@SenateMajLdr 

You have zero standing to talk about procedural delay tactics for political ends. Obviously.
