@McConnellPress @washingtonpost @POTUS so #trump compares the #USA to murderous #russia & coward #McConnell is a no comment
you would know, why don't you ask Ukraine, traitor
continue to make lame excuses, #ukraine is a sovereign nation,
doesn't make them less a nation now, #russia lover
#Liar not "scalia's Seat"  stop  justify your twisted perversion of #constitution #history will remember your lies
that seat also doesn't belong to you. It belongs to the people.
Then nominate someone with moderate views as opposed to someone more conservative than Scalia was
If that were the case, you should have allowed Merrick Garland to go in. Do it now.
Concur.  Hold that long overdue hearing for Merrick Garland.  YESTERDAY.
Ironic since that could be interpreted as a positive to vote on Garland
too bad you thought so when blocking Garland dirtbag
Are you kidding?  You guys boycotted Obama's pick for a year.  You make me sick.
But that's exactly why you played unprecedented obstruction with Merrick Garland nomination. Hypocrite
How hypocritical, you MADE SURE THAT SEAT BELONGS TO REPUBLICANS ONLY.
You are treasonous, didn't let people know about Russia.  SHAME!
Let the next President select the SCOTUS.
SCALIA DIED WHILST TAKING A BRIBE!
@McConnellPress @washingtonpost @POTUS Funny. U tried to say it didn't belong to Obama a few months ago.
Right.  It belongs to Merrick Garland.
Scalia seat belongs where he is, burning in hell if there is one.
Don't piss on my leg and tell me it's raining.
Shame on you for your behavior re: Merrick Garland, Obama's SCOTUS nominee!
You guys sure as hell think it does! #ShittyPoliticians
@McConnellPress @washingtonpost @POTUS but you think it belongs to Republicans #embarrassmenttomerica
True.The nomination to fill vacant SC seats falls to the current president.That person was Barak Obama.
In the past? just how far back are you digging?!
Funny you didn't feel that way last year.  Hypocrit.
If that was the case why did you block Garland. You FAILED TO DO YOUR JOB.
that's a lie, total fabrication on your part. Tell the truth: what are you getting out of the GOP deal?
Oh, I guess I missed the hearing you held on Judge Merrick Garland...
Then why didn't you vote on Obama's nomination?  Your short term memory is failing you - you should retire.
It belongs to Merrick Garland.
It's Garland's seat.
Which is what you said about Garland, right? Your hypocrisy is stunning. And blatant.
And yet you held the seat for the Republicans.
When did we hold a hearing or even a vote for Garland?  Oh, that's right, we didn't.
We reap what we sow Mitch, this mess is your doing, own it!!!
Same reason why your refusal to hear Obama or Clinton noms is BS. #IncompetentClown
Then why are you letting this evil person select a replacement?  He is trying to control the world.
Nobody's believing the Fake News Lying WaPo. You might give the same vibe to conservative voters.
#garlandmakes9
you should retired, old man! #byfelipe
Then why did you think you had the right to steal it??!
Are you kidding us??  You refused to give Merrick Garland a hearing or an up or down vote!!!!
I suppose that's why you didn't give Merrick Garland a hearing, Mr. Leader. #hypocrisy
@McConnellPress @washingtonpost @POTUS Are you so totally incapable of embarrassment or shame? Have you no honor left AT ALL?
@McConnellPress @washingtonpost @POTUS How do u have THE NERVE 2 even discuss SCOTUS seat, when u obstructed apptmnt 4 a year!
@McConnellPress Shut Up! You are the most hypocritical, obstructionist, loathsome, greedy, unprincipled Senator of all time.
Your hypocrisy is simply breathtaking. Confirm Garland.
you are a hypocrite. Refusing to confirm Obama's nominee to the seat was because you think it DOES belong to Republicans
Then why didn't you even vote on @GarlandSCOTUS ????????????
@McConnellPress @washingtonpost @POTUS U tell 'Dems, ditch the apocalyptic rhetoric on Judge Gorsuch'? How about U ditch...1/2
...YOUR 'bend over & take it up the chute for the OTHER team' approach to politics? 2/2
@McConnellPress @washingtonpost @POTUS
@McConnellPress USA humiliates UK war hero Dr Beharry at airport. Where is USA apology for this unacceptable event?
then why did you not give a hearing to Obama's nominee? HYPOCRITE
Victoria Nuland plan to overthrow the Ukrainian president is the reason Obama skipped Sochi Olympics!
@McConnellPress @washingtonpost @POTUS On your interview calling Putin a thug perhaps you need to look at what really happened
Wow & that says it all about the swamp! Do you think we'd forget stand on Garland? Supreme Hypocrite!
@McConnellPress @washingtonpost
why u didnt  write this shit when Garland was nominated
You comment says it all, true Americans realize it is a SCOTUS seat not Scalia's seat! #McConnellrule
@McConnellPress @washingtonpost @POTUS Your legacy is dimmed, dark. Aligned with a goddamned Communist. Shame on the GOP!
whoa, quite a trailer load of hypocrisy there!
@McConnellPress @washingtonpost Please http://Resign.You  come from a time that cannot possibly relate to progression
@McConnellPress @washingtonpost You took it upon yourself to block one & now you are showing outrage for the same thing U did!
@McConnellPress @washingtonpost @POTUS is that why it was open for a year? 
@McConnellPress @washingtonpost @POTUS and screw you in #scotus after what you did to #merrickgarland #traitor #gop
@McConnellPress @washingtonpost @POTUS the only thing you lead is a band of #America hating traitors

@SpeakerRyan need to answer why they approve of @realDonaldTrump speaking out against the United States! #AMJoy
again, you are a hypocrite.
BIG NEWS on the rampant poverty in KY with kids going hungry - such a great job, Mitch #stopchildhunger
Mitch McConnell, you are probably the worst person in the Senate. Congrats!
you think you can change rules only 2 suit ur agenda. You'll let country burn to pass bills. Spineless
You and the rest of the Republicans didn't stand with President Obama.  So ???
It was Obama's seat to fill. That was his job. You failed to do yours.
you need to resign from the senate.  You are full of it.
@McConnellPress @washingtonpost @POTUS I think the way you treated Merrick Garland was disgraceful. You violated constitution.
What hearing did Republicans give a nominee in 2016?A shameful exercise. What goes around-
Boo Gorsuch #nogorsuch
@McConnellPress @washingtonpost @POTUS You sir are a hypocrite & a discrace to office you hold.
@McConnellPress You "hope he can receive fair consideration"?! Like you gave Merrick Garland? You, sir, are a #HYPOCRITE
OK, then why did you blatantly stone wall Merrick Garland. Oh, Scalia's seat is only for YOU to decide.
One of the worst politicians in America. Still this spineless turd gets re-elected.
then why did you deny Obama's pick?????
@McConnellPress @washingtonpost @POTUS but remember you said this
Sure doesn't, you certainly don't have enough intelligence to sit there, you lie, cheat and cover up
Cherry picking facts.Ignoring the fact that you wouldn't give Garland a hearing.That was unprecedented!
@McConnellPress @washingtonpost @POTUS keep up the good work sir
@McConnellPress @washingtonpost @POTUS 
@SenateMajLdr if we donate $36,400 willl you have a town hall? You have Devos a cabinet job 4 that
@McConnellPress Right, so why did you obstruct a hearing on #MerrickGarland? Curious minds want to know.
Totally. That's why #MerrickGarland is the only #SCOTUSnominee
@McConnellPress @washingtonpost @POTUS it was stolen from Obama. No ethics left in DC. You should be ashamed.
@McConnellPress @washingtonpost @POTUS read ur comments. Kentucky needs to VOTE U OUT
Dems will block as revenge for Gardner and you know that. Waste of time.
@McConnellPress @washingtonpost @POTUS  This is trash, but GOP is a joke. Need full bench to protect constitution from Trump.
Two words: Merrick Garland!
How do synapses in a hypocrite's brain differ from a normal brain? Donate ur head to science.
@McConnellPress @washingtonpost @POTUS you're not  statesman Biden is.  Don't pretend like you are.
but you sure as fuck stole it, Mitchie!
"We're going to make sure Obama is a one term president". How is your in laws drug smuggling shipping business doing?
Then why Mr Speaker did you refuse the Democratic nomination for the seat a hearing? Liar. Hypocrite.
That's right.  It doesn't, and didn't a year ago either.  Karma is a bitch ain't it!
No, but the job of filling it belonged to Pres. Obama & you skirted your job for your own agenda.
You refused to give President Obama's selection a VOTE should Dems follow that standard
Unless it is YOUR. PARTY. Then you want to take away the Executive that won tge last election.
please vote NO on Betsy DeVos and find someone with experience
Devos have him $36,400 plus 2+million for his SuperPac. He won't vote NO & lose $$$
the best thing a hypocrite like you can do is stop talking about this.
Baloney! GOP will use any means at hand to get their way.  Completely bogus defense. Sad.
no nominee until Merrick garland gets hearing.  You stole Obama's rightful pick!!!  You cheat and steal
term limits for Congress just lk president,Pelosi's statement abt white supremist promotes race war agnst Americans
impeach mcconnell...most hated senator on the hill

Confirm Merrick Garland if this is true.
Mitch, you sir are the definition of a corrupt hypocrite
You literally blocked a confirmation hearing during Obama's admin. You are a hypocrite and a liar.
Really? Funny you say that now, when u & the GOP didn't let Obama do his constitutional duty to fill Scalia's seat for a year.
your op-ed was ghost written and we have a SC nomine; his name is Merrick Garland â€“ you know this.
Pulled my $ from markets, not investing til Bannon is gone #BannonMustGo #WeAreNotStupid
Really? You have to be kidding! Hypocrite!
this is cute given how you refused to even hear the case for Merrick Garland.
Doing just what @GOP has done in the past = not giving a hearing at all.
so you want someone who started a Fascist Club at his high school to have it?
surprisingly, I agree w you- that seat doesn't belong to one president or party, but then maybe tell that to Judge Garland
Please show me where it states that a president in it's 4th year doesn't get a hearing for SCOTUS.
You are an evil turtle.
It didn't belong to Scalia either. It belongs to the constitution and justice for the American people!
When you failed to vote on Garland for #SCOTUS, you stole the seat and made it your parties.
I guess the Clive Bundys have won with nomination of Gorsuch. I am extremely disheartened.
maybe if you would have held hearings for #MerrickGarland I would respect your opinion, maybe
Tl:dr @SenateMajLdr: "whine whine whine. Do as I say, not as I do" #shameless #honorless #hypocrisy #asshole #YourChinLooksLikeAScrotum
#Hypocrite party of "NO". Where were you for #MerrickGarland vote?
May the curse of Gnash be upon you.  May you get shingles and itch like a dog with the #OrangeMange.
It that was the case dung scarab, you wouldnd't have blocked Garland.
Suck-up. Please change your name to Suckingham, or similar: You shame Irish Americans.
#hypocrisy #hater
Uh... false, @SenateMajLdr, it belongs to @realDonaldTrump because you STOLE it you prevaricating weasel!
"Just as Republicans have done in the past." LOL!! Really? Like 20 years ago? "Uuuuuuh yup." - Turtle.
