Oh! Thank G-d, I miss drinking, cooking & bathing in filthy, polluted water...
You are an arrogant fool. Your disdain for your constituents will not be tolerated. You will never serve again
That's great soon we'll be wearing masks like The Chinese.
if you're a father or grandfather that is not a legacy want to leave behind for your children
To nice.  He is a greedy pompus ...  well you know what!

I imagine people in KY are DEMANDING coal slag in their water supply! #altMineralSupplement
You are aware that many Americans will suffer and many will die if you repeal the ACA?
If Kentucky residents want poisoned water so bad, give it to them!
#NoDisasterReliefToKY
Kentucky is soon going to be very angry with you. You can run but you can't hide
AND, I hope KY doesn't expect disaster relief when it does happen! #StopTrumpVerbalAbuse
did you see that article about the lack of diversity in #lexington? I am ashamed to say you're what we have taking the helm
Yes, let's keep those fools poor and just keep telling them that we're on their side.  Pfffft.
Mitch, you having done nothing for Kentucky in decades.
coal jobs have been in decline since 1987. Natural gas and coal cheaper elsewhere. Stop lying to KY!!
Now if KY had a coastline maybe they could bring back whaling.
Great- made it legal for #kentucky coal companies to polute a KARST state #epa  @McConnellPress @POTUS @cnn @amjoyshow

stop lying to KY, Mitch!   Your days in office are numbered!
Coal is dirty energy. Would have been better to retrain them to make solar panels. Healthier for them 2
...says the impoverished state's longest serving senator. What's he done 4 U in 30 yrs KY? #FireMitch
Mitch could give a shit less about us Kentuckians! He causes us pain..never relief!
I pray KY votes him out next time. He doesn't have best interest of KY or the country in mind.
Destroying our air and water for a few votes. This is nothing to be proud of.
SURE, who needs clean unpoisoned water, let 'em drink BEER! The rich can always move so f*ck the mobs!
how will relieved will they be when all their streams are polluted and the fish are dead!
No, it's a FU to the environment!
The people of Kentucky will be losing their ACA coverage so ur cotributors can get a tax cut! Creepy!
Total pigs.
Hello! You may have security leaks in the WH! Plz pay attn & investigate
how happy is KY going to be with you when you eviscerate the Medicaid expansion?
Regulations were not the problem with Coal! Market forces have made it relatively unnecessary.
If you're not announcing a select committee to investigate Russian connections, sit down and shut up.
SAD!!!
I swear we have a bunch of dummies in Washington SMDH
Great! Now @SenateMajLdr implement the rest of @POTUS policies.
WATCH LIVE @POTUS signs @SenateMajLdr measure to overturn Obama reg & bring #Kentucky relief http://bit.ly/2kCQCRk  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Al5EOg3_Lg0 …
How about giving relief & $$ to FLINT?  Seems like @GOP & @realDonaldTrump owe for swing state vote!
Thank you for giving that pen to the people.They will probably frame it in a central place Love you all
nice job you did supporting our President. Keep it up.
COAL IS DEAD .
.#LYING #GOPSCUM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO HELP YOUR CONSTITUENTS GET HEALTHCARE?
What relief are u going to bring?? The only relief we would get is if u would resign for collusion.
You can't save the coal industry, its not clean air regs, now kill med care for poor Kentuckians
I know the majority of your constituents use the ACA or Medicaid
what are you going to do for all your people that are going to lose their health care
FUCK CLEAN AIR WATER AND ENERGY RIGHT?
#russiagate is what you should focus on not polluting our environment - coal aint coming back

So you don't care about global warming? Do you subscribe to Donny's belief the China made it up?
When KY has no clean water hope they dump it on your doors.
YOu're an evil man Mitch. Such a liar and a fake, Shame on you SHAME.
This is not relief. It is another lie. Pay for training people in 21St Century jobs
for residents who like to die of coal pollution for the sake of the 23.00 hour job
Kentucky deserves better than this lie. Give real hope. Educate for the 21st Century. KN deserves this
Good going Mitch. Honestly wish you guys were not leaving on break.Private industry you work until done
Pollute streams so Kentuckians die 4 a 19th century industry that will b dead b4 2050. Well done! @mcconnellpress @potus @senatemajldr
congrats. you just poisioned the water in every coal town in America
Instead of promising coal jobs, deliver real education, so ur people can get real jobs. Stop lying
NatGas never going to allow those coal jobs to return
UR people need help, not lies. They can't deposit your lies in their bank accounts
another disgrace 2 ur office! U put Party b4 Patriotism! #GOPisTheNewIsis
U made these people promises u can't keep. U never intended to keep them. Shame on you
Only ur desperate constituents believe this. U know gas econs won't bring back jobs u promised. Liar
as a public servant you've sold your soul to the highest bidder 

Because FUCK clean drinking water, amirite?!
stop spreading propaganda from the Russian puppet in the White House. Country before Party 
bring it relief, or more dirty water and air?
