Exec orders can be wiped out by every new President. We need legislation which is harder because they require maj of votes
Merrick Garland deserved an up or down vote. Not so fun when it happens to you, huh?
U tweeted this Feb 6. A month ago. Did U tweet it 2 see how many RT U would get or are U going 2 do something
DOWN on principle of "He has as much moral compass as Treasonous Donny & govt breaker Bitch McCuntall."
Tell us again why you support anything that comes from the WH -that's right your wife's job depends on it!
not according to you a year ago.
So I guess I will just keep asking because still no response. What about #MerrickGarland
we don't tolerate YOU, Mitch!!! What kind of a leader are you??
Let's wait until the next election and let the people decide.
#NoGorsuch we need to stop this cabinet from #destroyingUSdemocracy
Just like Merrick Garland did!
disgusting GOP hypocrites
well you are in charge big boy. Don't tell us..go make it happen. Act like it's your job.
like you did for the supremely qualified Merrick Garland?
is anyone in your whole GOP capable of anything but mindless double talk? You're talking to citizens not DJT now
YOU DESERVE WHAT YOU GAVE OBAMA - NADA.
Why didn't you apply this same concept to Merrick Garland?
I'll pray for you.
#NeilGorsuch deserves the same treatment @SenateMajLdr gave to #MerrickGarland, no more, no less #2018sweep
He doesn't deserve any damn vote & neither do you. U blocked vote on a new justice 4 almost a year.
NO, who deserves to be nominated is #MerrickGarland
merrick garland.
DOWN #FakePresident
Do you remember the nomination that GOP stole from Obama? Well, now the shoe is on the other foot, you creep!
he should be treated with the same respect as President Obama's nominee
just as Merrick Garland deserved?
Wrong! You obstructed Obama 100%. Now you want cooperation? #hypocrisy #fakevalues #resist
We remember #MerrickGarland, no matter how much you try to gaslight us. You're disgusting.
the same way R's said they would block any choice of HRC for 4 years if she were elected. Hypocrite
@POLITICOMagFirst of all mcconnell, I wouldn't believe or trust ANYTHING you say or do. You and ryan,have proved
McConnell is a lying treasonous spineless sycophant w/ no moral compass. #ImpeachTrumpToday

#LameDuck failing @realDonaldTrump does not get to pick next #SCOTUS. #ImpeachNow!

There's not enough time left in trump's term to appoint now. Let the people decide!
Who did Uncle Joe refuse to allow a vote?

Shot? How about just lying? Biden did not refuse anyone a vote, ever.
Republican Party belongs to the KKK and Putin
not going to ever happen dick wad!!!
Merrick Garland deserved an up-and-down vote. Now your guy doesn't deserve jack or shit. He deserves to get Mitched.
Gorsuch will be confirmed one way or another.  Try and keep your panties on when it happens.
Merrick Garland deserved an up or down vote. Your hypocrisy is staggering. @SenateMajLdr @GorsuchFacts
.@SenateMajLdr @GorsuchFacts Give @NeilGosuch a vote just like Merrick's. DEMS SHOULD NEVER LET HIM IN. Filibuster forever! We support you.
Save it, Mitchy. 2 words: Merrick Garland
if only youd read your own twitter page youd understand where you stand in your hometown
disgrace
Just like Judge Merrick Garland. Right?
If Gore-suck had moral compass for job, he'd demand Garland as a real judge...must be so-called
same respect as #merrickgarland
Merrick garland deserved an up or down vote... in fact we won't take anyone else still!
MERRICK GARLAND FIRST!!!
I hope they block all you do or even try to do
it would be justice served
We/You have much much bigger problems.
Trump is using up international goodwill & dividing America
#StopTrump
I think the next president should choose the SCOTUS.
Start working. Get to @POTUS agenda items. Stop pussy footing around.
remember how you bragged about obstructing everything Obama? Remind me how this is different.
Yeah, just like you gave Garland and Obama. #Hypocrite
Sons Of Confederate Veterans awarded you?
KY was Union
#RebelFlag NOT historic
Racist

@POLITICOMag
>President Obama had a year left & U denied him his right 2 name his justice U can sit in the corner & wait 4ever
Mitch, give dems a week to start process and if they don't, NUC THEM!
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @VP @SpeakerRyan @seanhannity @oreillyfactor #Tucker @TuckerCarlson DO IT ASAP!
Other judges did too. You refused. Whoa re you to complain now?
Like Garland Got? & unless you apologize to @SenWarren I don't think you can expect much @SenateDems cooperation on Anything.
NO HE DOESNT!! MERRICK GARLAND! MERRICK GARLAND! MERRICK GARLAND! U SHOULD BE ASHAMED 4 DISRESPECT
Mitch McConnell is FULL of HATE.
NO BIG DEAL. DEMS SHOULD SHOULD JUST GO HOME AND REFLECT ON IT FOR A FEW MONTHS. 8 IS GREAT.

So did Merrick Garland, you lying hypocrite.
Please switch out your hypocrite hat for a leadership hat.
Garland deserved a vote a year ago. Hypocrite.
Merrick Garland deserved a hearing.
Fire! There's a fire at the White House!!!
Government is a mess & GOP owns it
Merrick Garland, also deserved a vote.
Yeah, and so did Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland.  And Coretta Scott King deserves to be herd in the Senate...
Yes. Just like YOU did NOT give Judge Garland. Southern Hypocrite. No statesman.
Why Trump is already campaigning and fundraising 2020 - and that was you "reason" for ignoring Obama's pick
Merrick garland deserves an up-and-down vote!!
Judge Garland deserved the same.  Hypocrite.
Read my lips: 
M E R R I C K. G A R L A N D.
I think you set the new standard...
Seriously?  You have no right to make this request after stonewalling Garland.  Republican hypocrisy.  #wewillnotbesilenced
DOWN.
#STOLENSEAT #STOLENSEAT #STOLENSEAT #STOLENSEAT #STOLENSEAT #STOLENSEAT #STOLENSEAT #STOLENSEAT #STOLENSEAT
We will not be silenced or bullied by your dishonorable disregard for Democracy. #letlizspeak
Judge #MerrickGarland deserved an up or down vote.  The Senate should have confirmed him first.
“Mr. Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens,” #CorettaKing
Hypocrisy much? Judge Merrick Garland!
Don't be a traitor. 25 th amendment justified, trump is mentally ill. Country before party.
nope! They can take as long as they want. You don't get a voice or a opinion. #douche

You blocked Garland why? Do you wear Chief Abstructionist badge? #TheChildPresident
you are repellant.
@GOP @TheJusticeDept @SenateMajLdr @Scotus You MUST appoint a Bengazi type (like the 8 on HRC) COMMISSION  #WeWillNotForgetOrForgive
just like you SHOULD HAVE confirmed Obama's choice right?
And you shouldn't laugh at your constituents when they confront you at a town hall. #doyourjob #IblametheGOP
@mikey7036 @GorsuchFacts @POLITICOMag Let's follow the same rules McConnell used for Obama's nominee
#MerrickGarland deserved an up or down vote too. Until you fix that, don't come to us.
Well since Trump's kicked off his reelection campaign, you need to wait & let the voters decide.
You didn't do you job the first time around. You should worrying about your AG & the lies of your fake president
Your opportunity to stand this ground eroded a year ago. Try a stronger shell. You'll need it soon.
SO GET ON IT! DO your jobs & get @POTUS cabinet in & Justice confirmed People are losing patience
threatening to hold up?? r u serious, traitor? how can u live with urself, wasting ur life selling out US sov??
The same way same respect you gave Merritt Garland?
Same fairness as was given to Merrick Garland.
NO there is no law stating there must be 9 judges, screw you!
Russia-gate begins!!! #russiagate
Have you no shame?
it's called KARMA N SHE'S COMING FOR YOU  KARMA IS COMING FOR YOU KARMA IS COMING FOR YOU KARMA IS COMING FOR YOU KARMA #BERN
Here's the thing, Obama's pick should have received an up or down vote too, here's to the Dems putting the screws to your man
Judge Merrick Garland deserved one too, you hypocrite. #SCOTUS
I can't wait until you are voted out!!! You are a puppet to the GOP and a condoner of racism!
INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION of Flynn and Trump.Lets see where it goes.We need to see his taxes.Who owns him? China
& the US deserves an investigation into Russiagate! Y are U not demanding an investigation- scared?
The people of the U.S. want to know why you let a spokeman for Trump tell us that trump will be obeyed. Coward
So did Obama's nominee but he didn't get one. If you don't think Trump is a lame duck you are out of touch.
Why?
.@SenateMajLdr @GorsuchFacts @POLITICOMag You are a criminal who stole this SCOTUS nomination. That's how the GOP does business.
The Senate should treat him the same way you treated Merrick Garland. You should be ashamed.
Piss off with your Merrick Garland year-long stall.
BS. Remember how you treated President Obama.  Impeach traitor Trump first
as did judge garland
you are an embarrassment to the great state of Kentucky
Hey didn't you say no SCOTUS apt during campaign? POTUS is campaigning now so no on Gorsuch, right?

Merrick Garland.
He deserves it no more than Garland did

no can-do we've already started the next election cycle and we can't fill SCOTUS seat during that time
if he's such a stand up guy, why are you afraid Mitch?
I agree with your earlier stance that prez doesn't get a SCOTUS pick at the end of a term
So did Merrick Garland
why the republican are so flaky and dispurst so easy when the democrat join force.  Get some guts
you mean the way you were so willing to confirm President Obama's valid pick? You, sir, are a GIANT HYPOCRITE. sit down.
#Resistamce #TeaPartyTerrorists
but Garland didn't?
So did Garland you gigantic hypocrite
you know who deserved an up or down vote?  Merrick.  Hypocrite. #republicantrainwreck

So, good cop n House, bad cop 2 kill legislation n the Senate will not fly with voters; we see through games.
so did Garland and we ALL know how that turned out for America #resist
No more than President Obama's selection did. Not giving his nominee a vote was disgraceful.
coming from someone who refused to do his job & give qualified & moderate #MerrickGarland a hearing #hypocrisy #WeRemember
Answer your phone you coward McConnell!
#merrickgarland mcconnel you are a #hypocrite
Wait, Mitch, did you do that for Garland?
Did someone give you hypocrites a pill to forget all of your antics from the past 8 years? 
you stole the seat from Obama!
Let's get Bills to the POTUS to sign. Let's get nominees confirmed.  Let's fill the judicial vacancies.  Let's not squander.
#MerrickGarland was an excellent choice and you ignored him. Hypocrite. You should be ashamed.
Merrick Garland
the EXACT same up/down you gave Judge Garland - he DESERVED it too! Disgraceful!!!
Merrick Garland deserves an apology
So did Garland.
Where was the up and down vote on Garland? As soon as you allow that to happen SIR, have at your vote. #disgrace
You are most immoral person that ever stepped foot in the senate.
You know who else deserved an up/down vote? Merrick Garland #StolenSeat #Scotus
