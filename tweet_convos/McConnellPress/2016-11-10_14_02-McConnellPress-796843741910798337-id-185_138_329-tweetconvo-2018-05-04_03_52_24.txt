Oh, do you mean finally doing your job? Now that the Trumpeter is elected Congress won't block progress?
Oh do you mean you're not going to block good legislation and finally have a do something Congress?
You deliberately stonewalled our beloved President all these years and you wonder why we don't trust you??
Term limits now! This is the single greatest legislative move of the next century. Be historical giants!
Dear Mitch-your history is one of not trying to work with others IS THIS YOUR INTENT WITH PETUS TRUMP?  DON'T
YOU NEED TO PUT IN TERM LIMITS LIKE WE HAVE FOR THE POTUS OR YOU WILL BE VOTED OUT NEXT! McCain almost lost.
if you don't get on the same page with President elect Trump you will not be Senate majority leader for long

Great country will spiral to garbage under you two.

and you BEST be ready to accept term limits! #TermLimits #TermLimitsNOW
Really in need of a comprehensive jobs bill.
I would laugh my A$$ off if you would have fell and broke a hip!
Good!  Because you haven't done a damn thing in the previous two years! You look like the crypt keeper!
You were on record as saying that your goal is for Obama not be successful and now you are going to do your job?
So will you and your merry band of fuckups take 4 more years do #doyourjob?  Garland deserves a vote!

Do unto others (Obama's Supreme Court nominee) as you would others do unto you
@McConnellPress @realDonaldTrump Enact simple majority in the US Senate or nothing will change.
@McConnellPress @realDonaldTrump . And we Dems can not wait to return your conduct toward President Obama and #BLOCKblockBLOCK
I hope his first step is encouraging the senate to replace you as leader U have been weak from day1
you mean on behalf of big business that you so routinely  take it up the ass from ? #termlimits
So you are going to start doing your job now that a white guy is in office?  Turtleheaded POS
@RosaR1942 @realDonaldTrump good
Hope you'll work with President Trump to build that WALL!  Kentucky is watching.
is Putin Puppet
This afternoon I met with President-elect @realDonaldTrump. We are eager to get to work on behalf of this great country. 
he needs 2 take garbage like McConnell out of WH & out of America  !
.@SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump And non-establishment Repubs are ready to get rid of establishment toads like you, Mitch. #PrimaryMitch
Shouldn't @SenateMajLdr & @SpeakerRyan be focused on the American Ppl & protests against @realDonaldTrump
Who do they work for? @ABC
why he is creating jobs for the paid rioters (not protestors)
Did you talk policy or just the plan to fuck people? Do you have a replacement for Obamacare or just repeal? @realDonaldTrump
Trump might not be so eager to work with McConnell after his lack of support for Trump.

The "professional protesters" are just people organizing through Twitter and he's the one to calm their fears
all of us or just the ones you like?
This has got to make you a little worried right? You've put our country in this fool's hands. Unbelievable!
great country who want to limit the rights of women, LGBT, Muslims and immigrants. Yeah, really great....
let's get those term limits in place! #draintheswamp
if you ruin the environment you'll get your ass handed to you by millenials in 2018 and lose your majority :)
@SpotShopMedia @realDonaldTrump 

Appears McConnell is passed best by date
What’s your favorite flavor of ice cream?  Mine is vanilla.
Need to replace you as the Majority Leader and dump Ryan as Speaker ASAP. Both of you showed no loyalty.
Well you better perk up Mitch and do a better job.
where the hell was this enthusiasm for the past 6 years? Try putting people over partisanship.  #resign
how your racism reeks.
Where were u, o senior statesman, when Trump took on the media, DNC and Republicans to win the POTUS????
So, you SOB, you actually start earning your pay check!
Give the leader position McConnell. You are the problem.
.......as long as he doesn't try for "term limits", which he should.
Why would you cut off talks of the term limit before he even takes office? Self-preservation is not why you were elected!
And remember that this election was a referendum on #Establishment politics.  @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump
prove it to us Mitch by embracing his contract for America.
@McConnellPress @realDonaldTrump 
DO THE PEOPLE & PRESIDENT TRUMP BUSINESS NOT YOUR ELITE DONORS
WE R AWAKE !
#SilentMajority
No you aren't. You're exactly what we sent Trump to Washington to get rid of...
#LIES LIES LIES & MORE LIES.  U.S. is now a  #Third-World Oligarchy. #ThanksGOP #GOPFAIL #GOP @SenateGOP  1% #thehill #AP
If you wanna work on the country, you won't block Trump. Otherwise your political career instantly ends.
Term limits aren't elections buddy. That's how the govt starts to work for the people. TERM LIMITS!!
@McConnellPress @realDonaldTrump
Your FINALLY "Pretending" to be ready? Creepy do-nothing obstructing #TurtleHead! Grrrr!
NIT HAPPENING, GOP OBSTRUCTION is coming back as KARMA!! Turtle man
now you'll pass a huge infra structure deal but not worry on how to pay for it
I thought Donny needed to make America great again. Now we're already great? Guess Donny can quit
Did he grope you?
enjoy the next 4 years, 2020, you'll be out of a job. #Rino
then get real on term limits...or get out of the way...YOUR SWAMP NEEDS TO BE DRAINED! !
Senator McConnell please remember we voted the Republicans in to work against the Dems not with.
Your keeping with some classy peeps these days eh Mitchie. Think how proud your Urban League folks would be.
Don't u mean "...on behalf of the oligarchs, bankers, n international corporations that bribe us"?
Am sorry, but until I see real deeds happening I won't take YOU seriously. Voted #TrumpPence16 to clean up.
I bet you are so happy you got wood#Trump
@BGPolitics @realDonaldTrump Good, TERM LIMITS!!!!!

@OldLinePatriot @realDonaldTrump

LickArse McConnell. Trump should #kick you off his bandwagon. Hypocrite!!
yes, Mitch, we can only pray that Trump will put your head on a platter as a gift to this great country.
@McConnellPress @realDonaldTrump you are a prime example of why we need term limits.
@McConnellPress @realDonaldTrump stop being a useless dick & actually work for the American people
What, no more obstruction?
so fuc___ evil and racist like @realDonaldTrump
.@SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump McConnell, you WILL fall in line with Trump's promises or be turned out on the street. Don't kid yourself.
Turn about is fair play. All the shit you pulled on Obama is going to be pulled on you & Trump now.
U R eager 2 stab him & conservatives in their backs. emailed U & asked U 2 retire. Give Ky bad name. Rhino
@McConnellPress @realDonaldTrump We R ready to make him a 1-term Pres.#DownWithTrump!
But are you willing to actually pass legislation?
No Supreme Court nominations by this lame duck should be considered until the people speak in 2020.

Oh! You acknowledge him now. Did you vote for him?
@McConnellPress Melina show you around you old dinosaur?
@McConnellPress you my good man are a liar
@McConnellPress @realDonaldTrump u need to retire sit. Give someone else and opportunity.
THE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO MAKE TRUMP A ONE TERM PRESIDENT , BUSHY CRIMINAL .
SHUT UP. Can U even get out of your chair & away from your martini after 8 years of 0 work?
Good we'll start with your resignation.
Hey Mitch! What are you doing to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns and killing 49 people?
We're holding feet  to the fire. Do your job
@BGPolitics @realDonaldTrump seen some quotes from you senator and it sounded more like obstructionist than help #sad
Still gonna be an obstructionist asshole? I'm still watching you.
Could have been doing that the last six years, really.
This great country has been waiting for years for you to do something . #1 Senate TERM LIMITS
You are both fuck-sticks. Eat a bag of dicks.
everything is great, we're great, it's a great day, great this and that! All 
we better see some action on that hill ! NO EXCUSES  !!!!
Don't stand in the way of his 100 Day Plan. Dems can't stop it - NO EXCUSE not to get it enacted immediately.
the only thing you 2 fuck or going to do is kill Americans that did not want in power. Let them Die - GOP way
Like you didn't work with President Obama? You jerk
term limits!!  !!!!!  Term limits
You better , no excuses!! Make America Great Again!!
Just as long as you work with the President-Elect and when he's President. That's the test.
Eat shit, McConnell.
the same way Trump did - over half the citizens are deplorable.
REPEAL and replace #Obamacare NOW.
Do you believe in inclusion?
Why did you drag your feet for the past 8 years?
