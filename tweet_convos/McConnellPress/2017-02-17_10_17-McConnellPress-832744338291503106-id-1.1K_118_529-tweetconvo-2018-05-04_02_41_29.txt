Hope U get Sen. Rep.in line & keep McCain,Graham & Collins in line 4 restoration of Constitutional sys.
great job Senate also a well spoken in the view today%
Oh yes he will let the rivers be polluted in a very effecient manner.
SERIOUSLY.?? Polluted Rivers??? Another baseless attack from the left!
Congrats! @EPAScottPruitt introduced earthquakes to Okla (sold it to frackers). Looking forward to his work on National level!
Of course you'll be long dead by the time your actions have their full effect. Of course you don't care.
And ruin things for our decedents. #shortsighted #dinosaurs
YOU appointed another liar cheated fraud
By respect I assume u mean he will cut regulations and make his own rules. Hypocrite. 
Sure he will...he is against the EPA...so how will that work?  Adios earth!
he doesn't care about the environment can we get New Democrats as well as Republicans
Since u all r so concerned about Americans how about Flint's clean water? No? You don't really care.
None of these are valid appointments until there is a full investigation of the Russian hacking.
You all don't give a damn about our planet or children's future. You are no leader, you are an oppressor.
Holding both of you accountable. He has a lawsuit pending against the EPA. No conflict of interest there??

#SueItPruitt was confirmed, then his #Emails showed he's an EPA Hater out to DESTROY IT #FUBAR #TRUMPLIES
I wonder how you sleep at night. The way you lie, & blame Obama of not working with you, your blatant racism. You have no soul
@SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump U all have basically killed me with ur new health plan.I hav preexisting condition.Just shoot me
Liar Liar Liar Liar Liar Liar Liar I guess u think #Americans don't read? We're not up on current issues? WRONG
terrible choice
It's civil war now, Mitch. That's what y'all have been itchin' for, isn't it?
Liar. You all should be fed water from Flint, every day for 4 years. You are pigs.
Unlikely. Sick of the bs Why do they continue to speak 2 us as if we are deaf dumb & blind?! #RESISTANCE

Mr. Leader-really disgusting to see how the liberal agitators are acting around the country. We stand w/President Trump & R's
Your selection is only to get rid of the EPA. There is not other reason as Pruitt is unexceptable
Funny It seems he committed perjury. Last time I checked that's against the law so tell me again..#Goplies
Even your face looks like a used-up old vagina, government-breaker Bitch.
hi mitch sir. Hope U can be in agreement saving Billions $$$ to make a new EPA run by common sense
while trashing our water, air, earth, health, in the name of corporate profits! #NoHonorNoRespect

You are sleazy liars & fake Christens.
Senator, why are you allowing the Democrats to drag out the confirmations?! You are the Senate Leader. Please lead!!!
Shame on you.
A proven mouthpiece for the oil industry. I hope you enjoyed selling you children's future.
He will destroy the environment to line the pockets of big oil. Very sad
Then why is he trying to keep us from seeing all his emails. He is an industry stooge and trying to hide.
? you are not a leader.
So you agree with Bannon when he said they were handpicked to DESTROY the agencies. You Sir. are a fool
Turtles like you have their rightful place in the swamp hiding away in their shell!

@McConnellPress @ScottPruittOK @EPA he respects fossil fuel, old and harmful, like the two of you crooks!
is as corrupt as you are. I support the @EPA and hope they will #Resist their inept leader.
but not the environment.
If it wasn't clear before surely it is now. Barring journalists is what a dictator does. #investigatetrump #thisisnotnormal
When did we stop believing in the 1st Amendment?
Will you all the White House to kill transparency in government? #fakepresident
No he will not! How many people in KY need to die in coal mines to make $ for his supporters? Affordable care?
He has not so far. What about a court order to release his emails? Ignored. Just another liar appointment.
hey mitch I loved your town hall. Never pegged you as a bottom though!?
Omg, what a freakin' lie. It's all you can do. He hasn't respected crap. JOKE! FAKE EPA lead.
As soon as he explains his emails that the court ordered released.  Shame on you.
and the interests of the fossil fuel industry...

No he won't you stupid turtle faced liar
What'd you all find in those emails? Were they released? Can the people get a followup?
Where are you ? #spineless #coward
ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN DONATIONS YOU COULD BE IN DANGER, GURRRRRL!
BULLSHIT!
. @SenateMajLdr your dismissive tone re: constituents you don't agree with is problematic https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/national/1000-protesters-greet-mitch-mcconnell-at-kentucky-speech/2017/02/21/18f42ce8-f85c-11e6-aa1e-5f735ee31334_story.html?client=safari …
laughs at his constituents instead of hearing their concerns, he is the swamp & Kentucky needs new representation now
Why didn't you wait for the emails, you hack? Party over country, well planet this time. #ShameOnYou
Emails show Pruitt was nothing but paid megaphone for Oil&Gas companies. Met your standard though (R).
that is laughable..respect the rule of law. Can't wait until he has to resign over his emails to big oil
just not the fed govt
You're such a coward,  Mitch !
You've been quiet lately Mitch.  Why don't you come out of your shell?
he will destroy it, and the environment you lying corrupt old man
Money cannot be eaten.
But he will not respect the environment, which is a BIG part of the job too.
U mean like Pruitt dodged providing emails 'til federal judge forced him 2 do so? U rushed him thru cause u knew he was dirty.
BREAKING!!!  

McConnell Defended Foreign Attacks On US Democracy!!
Anyone who hasn't read this should read it. TWICE! This is the kind of American Mitch McConnel is. #shame
Let's read that again. McConnell threatened the PRESIDENT to DEFEND Russia's crimes against us!!! 
McConnell threatened POTUS he'd attack as partisan any move to defend US democracy from foreign threat...
This is what betraying your own country for a few votes looks like.  (#treason ?)
This is the guy that wrecked OK with his assault on the environment.  Criminal appointment.
if you don't start listening, you wont be in office much longer. if someone pays you won't listen but instead you remove them
Great work on destroying the planet! Your grandchildren will pay with no clean air or water. #GOPFAIL
Republicans don't respect the rule or sprit of the law. This administration is a coup by the corrupt rich!
why didn't you respect the rule of law for Merrick Garland? Resign you hypocrite
Do you approve of this: http://occupydemocrats.com/2017/02/23/trump-just-ordered-army-evict-sioux-tribe-standing-rock-gunpoint/ … 
#NoDAPL #StandingRock
@ScottPruittOK @EPA

Will he respect the Environment?
no words to describe your greed n denial of the horrific illegal actions of your boss n his team #noshame
NO he won't. Any gov't that passes a new law to dump coal waste in our rivers is run by scumbags.
why are you allowing Schumer the ability to delay appointments and impede the oval office ability to work?
And Mr. Pruitt will destroy the planet so you & he can get a few extra bucks in your pocket from big oil?
And will disrespect our environment.  Do we have another planet to move to after earth destroyed?
I just wish he respected the laws of nature
U won't live forever & Ur grandchildren will suffer 4 Ur ignorance & stupidity! Mean old man! #KarmaComes

Time to get Sec. BEN CARSON confirmed. We need him now.
He will respect money from big oil & gas; the reason confirmation was pushed thru before seeing his emails
respectfully disagree.
http://www.politicususa.com/2017/02/22/mitch-mcconnell-spits-democracy-hiding-protesters-kentucky.html …
Eh, maybe. But will he respect the environment? His peeps aren't too sure. http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2017/02/donald-trump-scott-pruitt-epa-employee-resist …
Didnt you blast democrats for delaying nominees, now it comes out that Pruitt is in Coal's pocket?
you are morally bankrupt
WRONG!
delusional statement abt a man who repeatedly sued the EPA. Those emails will expose him #TheResistance
Mr Pruitt has sent emails confirming conflict of interest. Ask him to step down.
Bullshit. Another sub-par nominee who wants to destroy the department they are tasked to lead. #GOPvalues
You sound like a lying SOB
He can cuts regs  and cut staffing 50% and save time & money !
BULLSHIT!
Bullshit.
You may be in congress, but you sure as heck aren't a winner.
@SpeakerRyan you've been screaming #repealobamacare for 8 years. In all that time you should've had a replacement ready to go.
Pruitt was in bed with Big Oil and Gas and YOU KNEW IT, and rushed his confirmation anyway. SHAME.
This is why you have no lips. God's punishment on you. @LiplessWonder
But he won't respect the planet or the people on it who have to live through climate change catastrophes.
Because of my daughter we are proud supporters of the LGBT community.  Will you support her?
Since he does not believe in climate change I'm not sure what you're on about. Do you support his views?
While simultaneously shitting on the environment. HINT: it's not the "BUSINESS" Protection Agency!
Polluted waterways cause cancer, making u a cancer to your own constituents. Gutting the EPA is murderous!
You two deserve to spend your last days standing at the bottom of a coal shaft in two feet of cold water.
Exactly what part of Environmental PROTECTION Agency gives you trouble?
Translation: protecting the environment has gone the way of the dinosaurs that ppl like you don't believe in.
@PutinRF_Eng + @Kremlin_E used professional trolls+hackers to harass US online+promote #fakenews +hate! Quid Pro Quo= #treason
His own words in emails say otherwise. @SenateMajLdr @ScottPruittOK @EPA

Watch this frustrated woman yell at @SenateMajLdr during a luncheon in Kentucky. @cnn

#bullshit
.@SenateMajLdr @ScottPruittOK @EPA These CORRUPT idiot CON artists are bringing back orange skies & toxic rivers
you senile old fool he sued them twice ......who ever handles this acct for this ass tell him
Well, let's put in this way. He better. But I think he'll end up in court real fast with his approach.
POTUS: The press is the "Enemy of the American people" Do you or do you not agree with your president? Are you not outraged?
@SenateGOP truth is people are tired of our reps representing themselves & forwarding an agenda of whoever  pays them to do so
@SenateGOP Saying people are from outside your district or paid demonstrators is a cowards excuse.
but not the environment, perfect 
so he's a states' rights advocate like your people during the Civil War and reconstruction era
but he's going to pollute your family's habitat! 
Going to a townhall this Saturday with Republican Rep AOL. I will not shutup and sit down.  I am NOT being Paid!!!!
But not so much the environment? How do you keep getting elected?
Everybody hates you.
just not #NativeAmerican rights, nor animals, nor people. Disgusting.
Sure Right Just like you said "winners make policy losers go home" Your time to go home is coming
Has never respected the law, the environment, his constituents, the @EPA - he respects $$$$, greed #SellOUT
Ask #Oklahoma how they feel about this wolf!!
that's some bullshit!!
this must b a joke? He's sued them more than u have a chin
Scott Pruitt in charge of the EPA is such a ridiculous joke. We will stop him at every chance.Shame on you
You should dress up as a turtle for Halloween.
you're a traitor
It's time for you to step down, you are deeply disconnected.
