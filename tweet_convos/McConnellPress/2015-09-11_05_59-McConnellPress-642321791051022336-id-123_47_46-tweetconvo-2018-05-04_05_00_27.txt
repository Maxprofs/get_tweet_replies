@SenateMajLdr How could you possibly vote no on #Zadroga? By doing so, you've earned the right to never speak of 9/11 again #hypocrite
@SenateMajLdr and you made sure Iran gets nukes, so we can remember the first mushroom cloud over NY?
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress  and you pass the Nuclear Deal for Iran!  What a slap in the face of all who lost loved ones on 9/11
@SenateMajLdr ...of which you are destroying as a poor leader of the Senate.  Resign, sir.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress
@SenateMajLdr --It was you and your cronies who took us from "fighting mad" to "me, me, me, blah, me".

We are rudderless with you at helm.
@SenateMajLdr HOPEFULLY, THEY WILL JAIL @GeorgeWBush_43, #DICKCHENEY ALONG WITH @RumsfeldOffice FOR FUCKING UP OUR COUNTRY.
@SenateMajLdr Nukes to Iran? Your inability to truly remember is disgusting. Demonstrate your Patriotism and resign

@SenateMajLdr
@SenateMajLdr
.@SenateMajLdr How do you like the taste of Obastards boots? Traitor! How long have you been a Moslem convert?
@SenateMajLdr now show your best in stopping the deal with Iran! You have the power to do it!
@SenateMajLdr TERM LIMITS...
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress We'll remember you helped Obama lay groundwork for a nuclear 9/11 on 9/11 by not stopping #IranDeal.
@SenateMajLdr Ironic that your lack of courage and leadership results in the Iran deal.  You surrendered the treaty provision.  Coward.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress UR a disgrace& hypocrite.shame on u 4 going behind the backs of the republicans & cutting a dealw/Obama
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress UR are a disgrace& a hypocrite!Go hide your head in shame for what you've done behind the backs of republicans
@SenateMajLdr And on the eve of 9/11 you surrender your backside to the Iranians. You are a traitor and a NATIONAL DISRACE!
@senatemajldr @mcconnellpress Why don't you use nuclear option in Iran disapproval. Reid pulled it on you. Or dose your oath mean nothing?
@SenateMajLdr AND THE WORST LEADERSHIP SINCE THEN. YOU AND BOEHNER NEED TO RESIGN IMMEDIATELY. #IRANDEAL #LAST STRAW
@SenateMajLdr <--- not sure of his motives but "leader" will never again know peace. The Iran deal will haunt him to his last days & beyond!
“US Senate Delivers Nuclear Weapons to the Terrorist State of Iran on the Anniversary of 9/11”: http://tinyurl.com/oksosun  @SenateMajLdr
@SenateMajLdr and thanks to your incompetence in the Iran treaty it will happen again
@SenateMajLdr You just surrendered to our enemy, and we will both go to our graves knowing you are a COWARD and a FRAUD!
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress we are not seeing the best of the leader of our Senate. Kill the Iran deal.
@SenateMajLdr what an ironic tweet considering you've just sided with the enemy. I truly feel sorry for u and ur lack of guts.
@SenateMajLdr Blood is dripping through your old spiny cold hands.
@SenateMajLdr why don't you grow a spine and not worry about 2016 elections. you are part of the problem in Washington.
@SenateMajLdr @BeachinFree then remember what Muslims did, do not let Obama inject another 10k Muslim Trojan horses into the United States!
@SenateMajLdr it's time conservatives get rid of these rhinos
@SenateMajLdr makes you wonder what leverage Obama has over McConnell and boehner
@SenateMajLdr what a joke he is and he thinks the American people are stupid
@SenateMajLdr McConell is worthless he does nothing to try to stop Obama and is a fake conservative. Him and boehner do nothing!
@SenateMajLdr You're disgrace to our Nation! You hold the power to change the filibuster rule and stop this Iran deal. But you choose not to
.@SenateMajLdr facilitates Obasturd's Plan: Use illegal insurgents to overthrow US by destroying economy & flood electorate with socialists
We saw a traitor .@SenateMajLdr on 9/10 pleasure Obasturd #worstpresidentever with an unprescended arming of an enemy & terror campaign.
@SenateMajLdr it's his fault he's just as bad as the President of the United States he put his interest first before the American people
@SenateMajLdr No senator. We saw the worst yesterday when your failed leadership allowed O to give nukes to Iran.
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress You must not have remembered yesterday!
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress Shame on you McConnell
@SenateMajLdr 91015 the day America saw the Republicans at their worst!
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress   Platitudes  Mitch.  Worry about country not re-election
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress And by not stopping the Iran deal you are going to allow them to wipe out entire cities
@SenateMajLdr Sir, you seem to have FORGOTTEN. You have given Obama a perfect playing field. He owns he Executive, Legislature and SCOTUS
@jaazee1 @SenateMajLdr   You are a spineless wimp who has  doomed our country to nukes by your so called leadership.
