GOP to @NRA :no kissing leave $ on dresser..we are on to YOUR threats
@SpeakerRyan oh well
@SpeakerRyan #no vote no break
That's a good one Mitch. Try again and this time explain why.
What "pork" is attached to the Zika funding bill? Why can't you propose a "clean" bill, free of controversial attachments?
If you weren't so incompetent McConnell, this wouldn't happen, but you are and everyone in GOP knows it! @realDonaldTrump
Money Won't Fight #Zika Unless it'll Buy for #DDT
@SpeakerRyan They are #Democrats what do you expect?
@SpeakerRyan   Good..Lets throw some sugar or honey on the dems since they like Zika.
@McConnellPress "Leader McConnell" the ultimate oxymoron.
@SpeakerRyan You are kings of delay. When will you confirm or reject SCOTUS nominee?  #DoubleStandard
Dem are trying every way to block what is right for the People. Dem are only for Gov!
@SpeakerRyan You spineless #GOP sociopaths...YOU CAN SHIFT THE BLAME BUT NOT THE SMELL!
@SpeakerRyan There had to be a reason, Planned Parenthood funding. Repubs shouldn't have included that. Damn angry!!!!
@michnic70 and, that comes as a surprise?
not to anyone paying attention.
So Much BS in Washington , it's time we take back the hill , Clean House ! It's ours
Think we're stupid? You're trying to cut PP funding with that bill
@SpeakerRyan   Idiot - you've been Trumped - GOP obstructionism has caused this mess - SHAME
The NRA OWNS YOU!!!
laughable who is NARAL. Lol
Have a straight up or down vote without all the attached junk bills.
@McConnellPress that's because you tied to Plnnd Phood funding Mitch. #wheresthebill Why mosquitoes but not assault weapons?
So what? You're impairing the people in that crucially important body which President Reagan said in 1987. #DoYourJob
@SpeakerRyan time to get behind the republican presidential candidate or say I'm with the Democrats
@SpeakerRyan I'm not reading that anywhere.
@SpeakerRyan The majority leader & speaker are still shocked when Democrats are hypocrites and liars.It's R-peewees vs D-hulks
@SpeakerRyan there needs to be a change! All current politicians must go! No work no pay!!! For all of you
R they blocking Bcause U guys added a bunch of BS to the bill? Probably. UR fault, NOT theirs. #BSpolitics #dumbGOP
@SpeakerRyan meanwhile people are dying in our country from your big pharma supporters #betterwaytofleecethemiddleclass
@SpeakerRyan they don't mind supporting abortion that kills babies too
@SpeakerRyan that's because of your Anti-P.P. rider. You can only fool your under educated electorate, not the rest of the US.
@SpeakerRyan how does obstruction feel to both of you ?
@SpeakerRyan not surprised goes along with abortion Just Another baby in the womb. Unborn babies have no voice...
@SpeakerRyan Zika is not the most important or urgent health crisis to be dealt with. What is the real agenda?
@SpeakerRyan do a sit-in...
@SpeakerRyan This is why we hate #congress because the bill contains too many partisan provisions. #termlimits #DoYourJob
@SpeakerRyan That is because of all the unaffiliated crap you guys stuffed into the bill.  Why are you so afraid of @PPact ?
@SpeakerRyan it's time to recognize that there is a massive undercurrent of anti-establishment and work WITH @realDonaldTrump
Why would that be? Is the @GOP trying to attach senseless unrelated amendments to the Zika bill?
@SpeakerRyan screw ZIAKA tell these people not to travel where Zika is like you told the gays to stop having sex and aids
#DumpRubio #DumpRyan Donate to http://ElectNehlen.com 
@SpeakerRyan it's because of the games you and your rep. friends are playing
the bill will block access to birth control and restrict spending by Planned Parenthood! Why don't you tweet that part?
Why couldn't you just pass a clean funding bill?  Trying to use sick babies to push your partisan agenda is shameful #resign
@SpeakerRyan -Understood; that's why you are a failure
that's fine. Barely any of #Zika $$ is for US. Even though it's OUR money
Your little tricks to make it not your fault are fooling no one. Just retire Mitch, you're useless.
@SpeakerRyan Hm isn't that because of the crap U guys attached to the bill Bunch of babies fighting at OUR expense #DoYourJob
if Gov is so concerned about #Zika perhaps they shouldn't let Zika infected into U.S. That's the only way it can spread.
@SpeakerRyan More obstuction tactics  Congress putting Americans at risk  Again for partisan politics
@SpeakerRyan Really guys? If your bill has other issues, like abortion, attached, obviously there is going to be opposition.
@SpeakerRyan We need congress term limits! Get out all the old and crusty's. This means u McConnell.
@SpeakerRyan gun reform NOW
@SpeakerRyan quit trying to sneak garbage into it. Put up an HONEST bill and maybe it will pass. Idiots
@SpeakerRyan Tell them you'll fund it as long as they agree to defund planned parenthood which is unconstitutional.
LOL HALF THE MONEY
@SpeakerRyan ,,reid &pelosi, DUMB & DUMBER.
@SpeakerRyan You support a racist because you are a racist!
@SpeakerRyan calling BS, sight-unseen. You know I'm right...
#Senate #Zika #BetterWay TRUMPSUPPORTER
if your party didn't sneak in slimy legislation to strip women of healthcare perhaps you could start to do your jobs!
This is what you call KARMA ... GUN or MOSQUITO bite. Guns kill, mosquito kills.  Give and take ... simple results.
@SpeakerRyan Good #zika hype is overblown anyways. Facts: https://sharylattkisson.com/35factsandcontroversiesaboutzika/ â€¦
@SpeakerRyan why don't the 2 of you grow a pair and shut these people down. After their sit in, bring ethic charges
.@SenateMajLdr @TheDemocrats want more money for their baby parts factory to fund their fountain of youth potions. Its only 600 #Zika cases!
Because you added shit to the bill which has nothing to do with #Zika you lame fuk. You Republicans are some shady assholes
How many poison pills are in the proposed legislation? GOP, led by Trump, is the party of liars.
@SpeakerRyan It's not enough
@SpeakerRyan  They should ....
@SpeakerRyan right it has nothing to do with the fact u snuck in non zika related items is it? Honesty is a virtue #BetterWay
Guns kill more people in the US than Zika...If you ever read the literature!
#DoYourJob
Too back Zika isn't funded by NRA. How's it feel Senator?
: Tell America what unrelated amendments you attached to the bill.  This kind of political games you play pisses people off.
Where's my supreme court nomination?
elite GOP crybabies attempting to block Trump nomination.Senate and House you could not get anything down but a baseball game
The Dems have some balls while the Republicans are geldings!!!!
Just as you were WRONG about Sen Warren and The Donny don't think you can put any thing in a bill and the Dems will approve
America needs to fire all the democrats. The only way for America to get back on track is to remove them from office.
Oh noes! They migh "shut down the government" and that would be bad! Only Republican #traitors are allowed to do that!
Hey Mitch! What are you doing to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns and killing 49 people?
@mcconnellpress Thought The Senate gave 500 million for Ziva infection. Obama spent it on Global warmings
@McConnellPress support our Republican Nominee
Why did you add a provision preventing Planned Parenthood specifically from receiving any funding here?
Added because they try to bring down PP any way possible. It's only the most accessible/affordable healthcare for women.
You mean because you lot didn't attach ridiculous poison pills to it?
. @SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress high-stakes game of chicken, Sir.
Zika can be handled thru normal cdc protocol. Y litigate that. Democrats are getting confused. Kill Bill
@McConnellPress For some reason I just don't believe you Mr. Soon to be Senate Minority Leader.
Perhaps you should stop playing with people's lives and pass a clean bill.
because you added unnecessary garbage. Remove birth control restrictions, ACA Funding block, & maybe they'll vote on it #Zika
LOL And there's the catch. I did not even have to look far to find it.
