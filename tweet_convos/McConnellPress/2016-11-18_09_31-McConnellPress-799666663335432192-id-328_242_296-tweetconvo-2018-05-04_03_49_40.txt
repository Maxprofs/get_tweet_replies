.@SenateMajLdr dog, you're married to a person of color and you support this blatant racist?
wait what?!  Mind blown, McConnell has a woman of color as a wife and supports this racist nonsense?!
she is an accomplished person on her own, but I wanted McConnell to think. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaine_Chao …
can you provide proof of his blatant racism?
Sessions? He called a white defense attorney a "traitor to his race" for defending his black client for starters.
day and age you'd think that someone has actual "proof" of his allegedly racist heart. Right?  Or are we gonna hold him to 3/
trying to judge ones heart is a copout. I judge based on words and deeds. Sessions has said and done racist things again and again
@McConnellPress @realDonaldTrump @SenatorSessions
Sessions, another fascist. but you guys LOVE fascism so its no surprise.

Not surprising, but still disappointing.

@davidfrum @realDonaldTrump @SenatorSessions 
Put America ahead of party!
Sessions is an immoral pick.
Screw. You. -A Constituent...Unfortunately

That's because you're a horrible person. As is Sessions. As is the unpopular POETUS. Awful.
@nickconfessore @realDonaldTrump @SenatorSessions I'll make sure trump is a one term president!!
@nickconfessore @realDonaldTrump @SenatorSessions sad, sad, sad. This is not helping to unite the country. #racist #resist
@nickconfessore @realDonaldTrump @SenatorSessions "The most important thing we want to achieve is to make Trump a 1-term pres"
Just wanted to reprise Mitch's lovely quote...
Now FIGHT for them!
Gross.
No surprise, both of you hate voting rights and civil rights
Do you think grabbing a person in the genitals without their consent is a crime?
@nickconfessore @realDonaldTrump @SenatorSessions alright 1930 Germany comes full circle
@nickconfessore @realDonaldTrump @SenatorSessions what about the racist of Steve bannon? You kidding América right?
@nickconfessore @realDonaldTrump @SenatorSessions

#unfit.
@nickconfessore @realDonaldTrump @SenatorSessions And this is why we need term limits and racist men do not need to be AG!
What about the rest of it... ?/ @KYGOP @MitchMcConell
I'm glad U endorse him. He knows what a corrupt globalist puppet U are.
can explain to this hysterical chic why he wasn't nominated 30 years ago by both Rs and Ds?
Why do you strongly support him?
Get ready for a fight.
Amen.
Seriously? You know who also support @SenatorSessions ? Other open racists. Grow a spine & speak up.
Mr. Trump’s appointment of Bannon, Flynn and Sessions are the first steps in the project of taking America back.

As a white man, I am embarrassed by you three. As a father of black kids, I fear your type.
the rise of nazi power in Germany's parliament led to Nazi's and Hitler dictatorship>WWII. Grow a pair and stand up to racism
Sessions WON'T enforce the nation's laws. He's there to provide cover for kleptocrats.
wow way to show yourself on the side of bigotry and hate. History will condemn you #Sessions
he sold his soul a long time ago.
Is McConnell senile? Too racist to be a judge as per Republican Congress. OK now?
y'all good ole boys stick together #BlackLivesMatter #CivilRights
.@SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump @SenatorSessions Shame on you for perpetuating and normalizing racism in our government.
Senator McConnell, I did not realize you were racist & a white nationalist. I won't forget!
Sessions is a racist and someone who endorses torture- Democrats need to fight !!

You would. 
a man who says the KKK is "okay" doesn't belong in the White House. What about 1986? You're disgusting. The world is watching.
The first rule of Narcissism; surround yourself with bad people because they are easier to control.
@McConnellPress @realDonaldTrump @SenatorSessions of course you would red neck mcconnell- KKK lover
thanks for the input. The turtle has spoken. BTW why did u hide from Trump?
Wow way to sell out America. Sad but we will vote and you will go in shame
@davidfrum Interesting. Looks like I'll be making weekly donations to the ACLU.
we need you clowns at a 4 year term.  What a scary team.
Jeff Sessions the senator that apologized to BP for getting the Gulf of Mexico in their oil.
there's a special place in hell waiting for you, McConnell.
Mitch, the history books will not be kind to you.
@SenateGOP  @senatorreid  Why yes, Sen McC, you have been fair about all of POTUS nominations (NOT). You openly lie to Am ppl!
racist pos
Maybe you should support his proposals abt #TermLimits - WE WANT THEM.
Then you have no soul.
Ready to go back to work after years of neglecting your duties? #tookpaydidnothing Lucky us.
That is because you are without morals.
people are saying that several boxed sets of West Wing 7 seasons went to Trump Tower as background
really? here is one unimpressed constituent. Vote no to @SenatorSessions
Will you insist Sessions and Stephon Bannon have adjoining offices for more efficient hate transfer?
.@SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump @SenatorSessions  Your (racist) Alabama roots are showing.
Of course you do - cronyism at its best.  Do you realize he's an open racist?  #endracism
funny how you support this incompetent buffoon, but you never supported a brilliant Obama!
you are a big supporter of racisim
you love racism
HE IS A RACIST
all you racists do love praising each other's racism. Disgusting
You are FINALLY doing something right. I know by the number of negative junk here by loonies
"fair and expeditious treatment"! Hahah stop, my sides!!
Sessions pick is a total disgrace to what America stands for. RACIST
Thus putting to bed the faint hope that you're party has a conscience.
You're also a dumb turtle beholden to corporate and wealthy interests.
he's prosecuted civil rights workers for registering black voters... he's execrable
...things a sellout says? Why does Russia need new nukes? Why do jihadist only use AK-47s?
Grow a backbone, @SenateMajLdr
is he a lazy do nothing career politician like you?
Man who disdains civil rights law cannot fairly head the dept overseeing civil rights.Unfit.
@davidfrum @realDonaldTrump @SenatorSessions Because you have no integrity, soul, or human decency.
this is vomit inducing, but unsurprising. HATE WILL NEVER MAKE AMERICA GREAT. shame on you
well you're a southern white nationalist, so...
Um, he may be “principled” but I think you need to examine those principles. He’s a racist.
@davidfrum @realDonaldTrump @SenatorSessions wait until he starts calling you "boy".
The Party of Lincoln has become the Party of Racism.
Will you guys all start wearing your white hoods to work now that you're fully in charge?
Chickenshits. You should be ashamed.
Americans reject a racist for Attorney General. U refused to confirm Garland. Sit down.
Shame. This is pure cowardice. Someday they'll name a sewage treatment plant after you.
@DonaldT4Prez @realDonaldTrump @SenatorSessions Sorry  I am not thrill with McConnell remaining... hope he can be trusted now
McConnell and Paul Ryan are just cowards. You need to grow a spine and grow some balls.
so much for the party of Reagan & Lincoln. You will never again get my vote. And I'm a R.
A sniveling coward, a buffoon, and a racist walk into a bar…
more white power! Scumbag rich old white men! #TermLimits
Multiple cases of fainting injuries to hear! @MichaelMcGuire_ @realDonaldTrump 
H. Reid's twin endorse @SenatorSessions
So you're a racist too. You should be ashamed. I'm ashamed to say you represent KY.
Of course you would support the appointment of a racist.
draining the swamp to fill it back up with racist misogynists, no irony there
No backbone, no honor, no conscience, inhuman. Self before country. So sad.
As a Kentuckian I am disgusted by your hypocrisy. No vote on SCOTUS but yes to a racist.
Congratulations! Now you and David Duke have something in common. @davidfrum @realDonaldTrump @SenatorSessions
you so would
Thank you.
I don't care. #CantBeAJudgeCantBeAG #racist @davidfrum @realDonaldTrump @SenatorSessions
@ConnieHair @realDonaldTrump @SenatorSessions the turtle speaks
Love when Sessions called a white lawyer a "disgrace to his race" for representing black client
Birds of feather . . .
