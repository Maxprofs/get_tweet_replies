SESSIONS HAS A PROVEN HISTORY OF RACISM
Nevertheless, she persisted. #NoOnSessions #ShePersisted
You shame your position and your oath. You are obviously OWNED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
She resisted and so will the American people who care about justice

Let Warren Speak
Based on his record Sessions is not fit for office
Why isn't the senator answering any of his phones or listening to voicemails?
You can not lie to the American...what you did to Elizabeth Warren has no name...you should  the apologies
SHAME!  SHAME!  Shutting Warren down. You hate women like Trump.
Sessions is a little bigot and a racist.
You ought to be ashamed of how you treated Sen. Warren & #apologize
Shame on you for silencing Sen. Warren. Shame on the GOP for perpetuating racism & sexism. #NoOnSessions
SHAME,SHAME, SHAME on you for silencing Senator Warren!!

senator Sessions is a racist. You are a racist and a horrible man
so you silence Sen. Warren from reading a letter from Coretta King
I dunno if youve heard, but women don't do silence well. It isnt 1917.
SHAME @SenateMajLdr for not letting @SenWarren speak by invoking a seldom-used rule.
Session's records disagrees with that statement. The facts don't line up.
