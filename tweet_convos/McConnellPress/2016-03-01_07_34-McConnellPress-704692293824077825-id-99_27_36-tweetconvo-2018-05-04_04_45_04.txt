@SenateMajLdr @WhiteHouse @ChuckGrassley I can reiterate that the American people chose POTUS. He should not cede his responsibility to you.
@SenateMajLdr Look at the mirror, you are the reason why voters are voting for Trump. Your incompetence is causing all the issues.
@SenateMajLdr @WhiteHouse @ChuckGrassley the American people spoke in 2012 you're using us as your sorry excuse to #obstruct.
@SenateMajLdr And the American people would like to remind you that THEY HAVE SPOKEN! @WhiteHouse @ChuckGrassley
@SenateMajLdr @WhiteHouse @ChuckGrassley What about the voice of those who voted for President Obama TWICE?  Does that count?
@SenateMajLdr @WhiteHouse @ChuckGrassley We chose Obama, twice. Shutting down Judiciary branch will garner more support for Trump.
@SenateMajLdr @WhiteHouse @ChuckGrassley And then you'll lose the Senate come November. #GOP

@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @ChuckGrassley don't ever quote the Constitution again.  You've lost your right to uphold it.
@tosspowertrap GOP Senate in 2014 - as your POS POTUS said " election have consequences "!  NO SCOTUS filled in 2016 - shove it POS POTUS!!!
