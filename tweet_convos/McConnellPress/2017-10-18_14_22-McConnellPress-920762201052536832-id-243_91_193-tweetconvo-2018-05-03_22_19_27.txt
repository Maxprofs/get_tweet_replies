To bad it is really for your billionaire donors 
I believe the facts there douch
You left out the 1% or is that a given in your circle?
Eliminating the Estate Tax? How many middle & lower class families have an estate worth more than $10 mil? Yeah tax reform. #sarcasm
Your #TaxReform is a top priority for corporate business against #smallbusinesses & entrepreneurs that rob workers from their rights!
Too bad your proposed plan lowers taxes on large corporations and the wealthy, not small business entrepreneurs.
The companies will use the money to pay shareholders, not create jobs.
Come on Mitch show them you have the Leadership we all know you have
What happened to Repeal and Replace Obamacare?
If GOP told Truth voters could have honest discussion how to help America reduce debt, increase jobs & wages. Instead Trump/GOP spew LIES
Even ESTATE TAX they LIED that it won't help POTUS or the wealthy! 

To sell it: more LIES: how so needed by poor family Farmers & Truckers!
Well you better get it done Mitch!
Then do something for once and stop blocking President Trump's agenda!  We elected him for a reason!  #MAGA #GodBlessAmerica #AmericaFirst
But what about your average person...not a business!
All talk until get it done. This year!!! Rep. pass something this year. Done nothing.
Let’s get it done before the next congressional break!
You're trying to cut taxes for the rich and large corps & want us to believe that is supposed to help small business how? You are horrible.
We’ll believe it when we see it in writing!
Too bad the Republicans don’t know how to do anything but hurt elders, the sick, children & disabled!  Go Home!
As long as the rich get more off the backs of the working class! You and the #MoronInChief should be ashamed!
Doesn't seem to be a priority for you or congress.
Yea ok not.
I blame his quadruple chins!
@CNN @FoxNews Devil is in the details! Will REALLY be a middle class tax cut or a tax cut top 1% and big business?!?  Reform?!?
You're not fooling anybody. We all know you'll end up in a cheap motel smoking crack and blowing strangers. #maga #gop #tcot #FOESAD
Bullshit
Sir, You're a Decptive Lying Sack Of Lobbyist Bribed Corporatism Proponent Anti-USA Right Wing Dog Shite Proven by Your Anti American Record
Time for u to go!  You are part of the problem! The Swamp!
And you failed Us on Obamacare!
Yes it is.  Why are we so concerned that you will fail us again?
A 15% tax break (gift) for MILL/BILLIONAIRES doesnt mean shit to working families & small business. An additional 2.2 TRILLION DEBT FOR US!
America’s 1% 2% of Americans Trumps cabinet and congress people will benefit not the middle class. Republicans are racist liars  
You are lying. Your tax plan is a sham designed to take our money and give the spoils to the wealthy.
Shouldnt that headline read, “Lower taxes on rich people?”
Mitch I think its time to change the voting rules in the senate so we can get the agenda passed. please read this

Mnuchin confirms your tax “reform” benefits “the wealthy.” So Mitch McConnell says,”Rich Lives Matter.”
go repeal obamacare and resign 

maybe then American people will not remember you as the worst majority leader in history
Not so fast Mitch. Think again.
...and hide tax cuts for the rich inside the bill.
"He knew what he signed up for."
-@realDonaldTrump's words to the widow of a fallen soldier.
Two words for you Mitch “Steve Bannon” and he’s coming after you.  Run, Mitch! Run away very fast!
Until you start taxing those who have more money than they need I will never believe a single word from you. You really aren't even trying.
But U are lowering taxes on the wealthy. AGAIN I ASK, WHO IS GOING TO MAKE UP THAT 15%? The middle class and we ALL know it. STFU Mitch.
No, top priority is to fix or change our voting system 2 keep the Russians out of it and educate our electoral college Re: responsibilities
If you really cared about small business, you’d support #MedicareForAll
Bull shit
Trickle down doesn’t work.
So they oppose your junk plan, too? Good for them. Unlike you, that means they’re on the moral side.
Well dammit - quit tweeting & talking and do something to make it happen!!!
I am eager to see that you also value middle America and don't raise my taxes.

You do realize you r the senate majority leader right?
Why isn't Puerto Rico your top priority????  Oh, because you're the GOP and you ONLY care about $$. You guys $uck.
And for the coke family....
Don't have any good ideas so just going to start bribing people for votes I see. That's @gop vision of democracy
You're right, except Trumps tax plan will kill small businesses
You mean the wealthy and the 1%?

Sad
Repeat,repeat,repeat doesn't make it true.Some of us are smart enough to know this tweet &selling of "tax reforms" is just $$$ for the rich
Why do republicans all want to raise taxes?? #fakemath
top PRIORITY MM is IMPEACHMENT, THATS TOP PRIORITY....GET HIM OUT! GET HIM OUT   GET HIM OUT.   GET HIM OUT. GET HIM OUT @realDonaldTrump
LIAR #Liar #LiarLiar #LiarInChief #LiarLiarPantsOnFire @GOP #mitchmcconell is #liaroftheyear aside from @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #TrumpLies
"Reforming our nation’s tax system is a top priority for the already #SuperRich and also soon to be #SuperRich." #taxreform

Why isn't it a top priority to protect children's health care thru #CHIP? Horrible ur using kids' health as pawns to give tax cuts to rich!

Lies
There's hidden Agenda for the wealthy in here. If u think small business will pay emp more ur sadly mistaken. @marcorubio @SenBillNelson
Reforming isn’t going to a dime in any workers pockets!    It lines stock holders pockets!   Not falling for this line.
Reforming @GOP to put  in front of party should be your priority #1. I guess that is to much to expect from someone like you.
Where did I hear this before...?  Oh yeah, three decades ago, before a greater tax burden was shifted to small business from the big corps
Yeah, top priority for you folks to secure massive tax cuts for the wealthiest. #TAXPLANforWEALTHY
NO TAX REFORM UNTIL WE SEE TRUMPS 2016&2017 TAX RETURNS!
Why not just simplify it to 1 rate for individuals,business&corp? No subsidies. Tax individuals after $35,000, business/corp after expenses.
The Kansas Experiment has FAILED!  Stop the dishonesty.
Rand Paul says he has to vote no, get that dog on a leash before he kills another movement
And the middle class?
You mean a top priority so the rich can get richer and the poor poorer.  We know what you evil people are up to.
market rise despite no republican legislative "wins", or corporate tax  breaks, undermines #GOP @POTUS claims the tax breaks are needed.
TRUMP & BANNON WANT TO DESTROY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND YOU'RE LETTING THEM! WTF?
12% of the population support this so called tax reform. The top 1% support it fully, including of course the  orange man rapist.
HOW COULD YOU LET INSURANCE FOR 9 MILLION AMERICAN CHILDREN EXPIRE? WHY DO YOU AMERICAN CHILDREN? DISGUSTING DISPLAY OF SELFISHNESS!
I think impeaching trump is a higher priority! #IMPEACHTRUMP #TRUMP4PRISON #GOPDOYOURJOBS #GOPFAILURES
Small business. You’re joking with us. Nice one. I like the humor. When r u going to say it like it is. Tax reform for the super wealthy.
It is  so HARD not to give tax cuts to the wealthy!
WHY ARE BUMP FIRE STOCKS STILL LEGAL? THEY ALLOW SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPONS TO FIRE LIKE MACHINE GUNS LIKE THE VEGAS SHOOTER USED! WTF?
If only you had a clue how.
So we're to happily assume everyone gloriously benefits from your carefully plotted plan for tax deformity?

#creepyGOP
Why not support amendment that guarantees that the top 1% won't get tax break. Trump said, "I like the poorly educated." I guess you do too.
Unfortunately the Democrats won't vote for anything that our president wants obstructionist an UnAmerican God help us! MAGA
How about some concern for the middle/lower class? How about giving Americans a real break from the @GOP #mean
Removing this president is America’s top priority.
Quit lying mccturtle. U have that Russia taint too. #Traitor
Removing the mentally ill individual from the White House should be your first concern, not a tax break for the rich.
Nope.  Not even close to a priority for anyone. We aren’t distracted. #TrumpRussia #MuellerIsComing #RESISTANCE
misleading!! this plan is mostly just a payback plan: helps the 1% & yr donors.
Nope
I do agree with lower tax for small business - maybe start with payroll taxes - I just don't think we need to almost cut the rate in half from 35% to 20% #TaxReform
It is important! You should try to get some honest ppl to do something! Make it a public issue instead of being a bunch of sneaky bastards!
Dear Mitch,
 Have a nice day!
SO WAS  Health Care for 7 years.  How long will you need to fail this time.  We don't have 7 more years to wait for your office to succeed
America’s richest R richer than ever w/ a net worth $6.7B, a record high Why is the #taxreform giving them new cuts
Just stop. It isn't helping anyone but the very richest.
What about the middle class?!
We don't trust you. SEN Rob Portman Ohio (R) said middle class is around 100K a year. The GOP is totally insulated from  real life. So turtle man what is the $ middle class that you base this fabulous tax plan on? Let's have some specific dollars in income. Lie lie lie lie.
You look like a turtle

 Failed leader
Like Regan did, then reversed half of them, then Daddy Bush, Then Clinton increased cause it f'd up the deficit, that one?

Wrong! It would put more money in Trumps pockets and bring the national debt way up. You're dumber than I thought.
How about finding CHIP?  What about kids who need healthcare.  Is that a priority.   Or tax cuts for the wealthy first.  
Small business will fail with the #eldmandate ATA is not for small trucking companies look for yourself #Eld_or_Me look at @OOIDA
Tax reform is top priority not only for small businesses; but all America, Esp. Wall St.; Senate: Never do today what you can do tomorrow.
LIAR
Let's see results!
You would consider Koch brothers’ business entities as small businesses.
No. Because it won't help small business, treps, or the middle class at all. It will only help the ultra rich at our expense, & you know it.
Nope. Increases to national debt, backdoor cuts to Medicare. More $ for your masters (see pics). We get peanuts. Shove it!
please stop treating the electorate like ignorant sheep


Your plan will actually kill small businesses
I hope I get trickled down upon. 
always leave out the part about MASSIVE cuts for the rich and MASSIVE medicaid cuts.
To give the top 1% & Corporations 80% of the tax dollar$ won't create one job or raise wages, but will give stockholders millions.
Who are you trying to convince? Or is the first signs of Dementia !
Reauthorize CHIP, premium assistance for medical coverage, stabilize insurance market. Healthcare not tax cuts. #HealthcareIsLife #Murderer
Jam it turtle boy! You have been lying and manipulating for so long you think the rest of us are stupid enough to believe your snake oil.

Then Y is small biz, 70% job creator, taxed at 25% while big biz, 30% job creator, taxed at 20%?
No matter what it costs in debt and service cuts? Don’t know the bottom line so can’t evaluate it. You are just guessing. We want details.
you better straighten out your act or you are gone, voted out of office.
#RINO 
#University6 #Coach2
Please, just do it!
You probably think that if you just keep spewing these lies long enough they will become true. But you are wrong. You are so immoral.
Constantly spamming your demands appears to be an attempt to wash away the tweets from informed citizens. 

We KNOW this reform is awful.
Enough talk American citizens want action in 2017 get it done
#TrumpTaxPlan is MAJOR benefit for top 2%. Middle/Poor class get MINUTE to ZERO benefits. #NoTrumpTaxPlan @Sen_JoeManchin @SenatorHeitkamp
Mitch, I hope you're sincere, as you have'nt got anything done, or supported our President. Conservatives are watching what you do next.
Lies   gop always goes with the rich
Affordable healthcare is the first concern for many considering entrepreneurship
The US Attorney LIED to Senate Judiciary  Committee
About Russian Contacts 
TRUMP has NOT Released his Tax RETURNS?
Would there be conflicts
How many times a day are u sending this Bulls**t!  It's all ONE BIG LIE!!
Make sure that rich pay at least 10% tax and can’t write it down to zero. Take away write-offs so pay their share. Not doing so now.
Tax reform has been tried by many Presidents and not one has worked out yet so i don't believe this won't work at all.
If Mitch McConnell really meant what he says then he'd be supporting the #FairTax
#FAIRtax does more 4 small business than ANY other #Taxreform to level playing field. 
@NSBAAdvocate 
@NFIB 
…
Bulls**t!  You are a parhological liar!  You won't get away with this scheme!


We are giving you tax breaks so you can spend that money on health care WIN WIN
Eliminating Property Tax 
Deductions will kill working 
class Folks.
Wait till your Opioid base figures it out.
As usual,
YOU SUCK MITCH.
It's not even close to the need to IMPEACH TRUMP!!! Get to work on it!!!!!!
Your top priority should be impeaching trump
Anything to steal more money from the American people. We understand. No need to keep rubbing it into our faces

Sure thing. Just like #repealandreplaceACA. you’ve had 9 months... PLUS 7 yrs to prepare. Not sure what you are doing on The Hill but it’s not keeping your promises.



Im still waiting for my trickle down from Reaganomics. Do you know when that will happen?
Trump McConnell #Taxreform = More money for billionaires. Medicare cuts and a ballooning National Debt. SAD!
Is that picture part of the ten most wanted list?  These are the top two.
BULLSHIT! It's welfare for the wealthy  & kick in the butt for the rest of the citizens. Why R you always lying like Trump to the citizens?
So much talk; so little action. Oops, that should read “no action.”
@SenSchumer @NancyPelosi All tax paying US citizens and Corporations are entitled to #TaxReform.....but Democrats like to discriminate.
Reforming legalized bribery of Congress, including bribes by Putin-linked oligarchs, is a top priority for all Americans
